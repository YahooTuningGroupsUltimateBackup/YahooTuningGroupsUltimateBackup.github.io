It<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t impossible, but it is up to you to figure out how to guide us to<br/>&gt; actually perceiving the order in your method, rather than<br/>&gt; understanding it intellectually.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You have obviously studied your method enough to where you can see<br/>&gt; some kind of beauty within it that is not immediately apparent to us.<br/>&gt; It would be good for everyone if you could get us to perceive the same<br/>&gt; order within it that you do. But you can&apos;t get us to perceive that<br/>&gt; order by trying to convince us that what we already like is &quot;bad&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;wrong.&quot; There is no conflict.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Mar 5, 2009 at 10:19 PM, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I really can&apos;t understand why some people prefer this meantone version to<br/>&gt; &gt; the correct JI version.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just listen to them side by side:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/AveRegina_TGM.mid">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/AveRegina_TGM.mid</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Marcel/Lasso/MdV_JI_Lasso_trombone.mid">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Marcel/Lasso/MdV_JI_Lasso_trombone.mid</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The meantone one sounds like an old effect.

One of the members here is an expert on this subject, as he writes music software that has to deal with this problem- Fractal Tunesmith. Hopefully he&apos;ll chime in on this. Anyway, it&apos;s entirely possible to have some very serious misunderstandings because of things like this, as you can imagine!</p><p>So I thought it might be a good idea to to a strictly tuned JI &quot;5 limit&quot; triad just to see if we&apos;re talking about the same things.</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2009 6:24:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I thought it might be a good idea to to a strictly tuned JI &quot;5 limit&quot;<br/>&gt; triad just to see if we&apos;re talking about the same things.</p><p>But what do you mean with this.<br/>I know very well the one chord on measure 3 in the Lasso is a 3-limit<br/>pythagorean chord..<br/>And even if you wish to say the JI version of the Lasso is not 5-limit<br/>because of this chord then I can&apos;t agree with that defenition but be my<br/>guest and call it not 5-limit I don&apos;t really care it&apos;s not what it&apos;s about.<br/>But you seem to hold the beleif that a pythagorean chord is not allowed in<br/>any correct JI transcription of music.<br/>I say it is allowed and it&apos;s what Lasso wrote (without knowing it himself<br/>most likely).</p><p>Lasso wrote a counterpoint of several melodies.<br/>I gave the transcription and midi rendering of what he wrote.<br/>To transcribe it any other way would be to destroy the melodies and would be<br/>wrongly writing the underlying structure of this piece.</p><p>Perhaps he intended to make the melodies go in such a way that also the<br/>chord on measure 3 is a consonant major triad.<br/>But if so then he failed in this (can&apos;t blame him as most choirs would make<br/>this (wrongly) into a 4:5:6 like triad probably).<br/>Though when sung exactly like I transcribed in JI by a real choir I&apos;m sure<br/>the pythagorean chord will still sound beautifull.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2009 8:25:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ok no longer a pythagorean chord.
