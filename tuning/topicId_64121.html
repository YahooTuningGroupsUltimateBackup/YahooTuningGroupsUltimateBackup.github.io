I put<br/>on a disk (A Troubled Resting Place) and checked out his site.<br/>Listened to some samples and decided to order online from him. The<br/>next day I got a nice confirmation email from him, including some<br/>interesting comments on tuning and related issues (there is a place on<br/>his order form for you to submit comments).</p><p>Anyway, a nice experience, some personal contact with the artist<br/>himself, and a pretty good model for anyone that wanted to<br/>support/disseminate what they do...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
