Anaphoria, which is a<br/>country of exiles, has had to defend its borders from all forms of &quot;attacks&quot; including from<br/>those who approach with good intentions. The music of the missionaries had developed<br/>apolitical associations that were far from pleasant. The instruments themselves were retuned<br/>to a meta-slendro and were incorporated into the shadow theatre. The process of assimilating<br/>one enemies is a device they learn from the missionaries themselves.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am certain that some would feel even more strongly about this<br/>&gt; intonational inaccuracy.  In fact, I believe this was the kind of music<br/>&gt; that was banned in Anaphoria around 1895, due to its intonational<br/>&gt; infidelities....</p><p>-- Banaphshu<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
