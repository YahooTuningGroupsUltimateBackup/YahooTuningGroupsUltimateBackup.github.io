I told him to swing by here so maybe he can<br/>expound on it more, but can anyone comment on the cognitive<br/>significance of scales like these? Are they somehow related to MOS?<br/>He&apos;s about to write a MATLAB program to do a systematic search for all<br/>scales with the deep scale property from ET&apos;s 7 up to 31. His<br/>motivation is that since a lot of the scales we use in music tend to<br/>have this mathematical property, that it must somehow be cognitively<br/>relevant.</p><p>The whole thing to me sounds like something related to MOS, and I&apos;m<br/>curious to see if he keeps barking up this tree long enough if he&apos;ll<br/>discover that what he&apos;s really after is Fokker.
