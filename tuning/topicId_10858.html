Sorry , Mr. Wolf.

It almost certainly won&apos;t be usable from a DOS sequencer, which<br/>is what originally came with Scala (I&apos;m behind now).</p><p>I used to use Cakewalk Apprentice for sending the tuning dumps.  I got<br/>Scala to open it and play the files automatically.  I forget the details<br/>now, but I think I wrote a Scala script to save the file and launch<br/>Cakewalk with it.  It may even have been easier than that.  You can launch<br/>Cakewalk from the command line, provided you know the exact path name.<br/>Give it a /Play option, and the name of the file.  One problem is that you<br/>have to close Cakewalk first.</p><p>I&apos;d be surpised if Cakewalk had stopped sending SYSEX for standard MIDI<br/>files.  There may be an option you have to change.  I remember the Windows<br/>Media Player not sending the SYSEX.</p><p>There are a few things you have to set on the TX81Z, as has been<br/>mentioned.  I think Scala makes the files for channel 1, so the TX81Z has<br/>to have it&apos;s MIDI receive as either 1 or omni, or it won&apos;t get the tuning.<br/> You should get a buffer overflow message if the buffer overflows, and<br/>usually you can ignore it.</p><p>&gt; The synth seems like a great &quot;classic&quot; box to me.  Sure, some of the FM<br/>&gt; sounds are probably greatly improved upon today, but the tuning<br/>&gt; possibilites are amazingly flexible (any pitch in the entire keyboard<br/>&gt; can be tuned to ANYTHING-- since any of the set keyboard pitches can<br/>&gt; become ANY OTHER pitch in the entire range, and then can be adjusted by<br/>&gt; the TX81Z tuning units... The only limitation is the size of the tuning<br/>&gt; unit 1.56 cents.</p><p>I find the background hiss to be the biggtest problem with mine.</p><p>&gt; Actually, the bell sounds in FM boxes, this and others I have &quot;played<br/>&gt; with&quot; are extraordinary.  I doubt those have been much &quot;improved upon.&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s that new Yamaha box, but it doesn&apos;t support tuning.  I reckon my<br/>Kyma system could just emulate a TX81Z, if I can work out how to do<br/>operator feedback.  More likely I&apos;ll use it for effects, and try to get a<br/>noise filter working.  That should leave enought of the DSP to do<br/>something cleverer.  If only I could play with it all day!</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=10866 href="#10866">ðŸ”—</a>shreeswifty &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2000 4:34:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am so glad folks on the list are using the TX81z. I found out it could be<br/>microtuned from Dr. Jim Sain at UF electroacoustique studio that it would<br/>take the Dump. The problem seemed to be that the soundblaster live would not<br/>send the dump via gsplay because it is a dos program. So i spent like two<br/>weeks bitching and complaining before i realised that if Scala made Midi<br/>files surely one could play the midi file into the module. I am so glad<br/>Darren was able to help you listers!<br/>Another wonderful contribution fro SEJIS.</p><p>Thanks Darren.</p><p>Shreeswifty<br/>SEJIS</p></div>
