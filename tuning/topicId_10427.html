For example, theme and variations may correspond to permutations and combinations.  The concept of randomness appears as aleatory music, such as in some of the works of the late John Cage, and some computer generated compositions.</p><p>Some would say that the rigid application of math such as the above is a poor substitute for genuine inventiveness, inspiration and creativity.</p><p>In thinking about musical scales, one should first consider the nature of sound and hearing before deciding what mathematical processes might be suitable to apply.  For example, our perception of the second most basic consonance (after identity), usually referred to as the &quot;octave&quot; or  &quot;2/1&quot; relationship, is logarithmic, rather than linear.  So it is based on the multiplication and division of frequencies (pitches) by two, rather than addition and subtraction of any particular number of cycles per second (Hertz, abbreviated Hz).  So powers and roots can be involved, even with multiple &quot;octaves&quot;, but not necessarily roots of negative numbers.</p><p>Even though we describe music in terms of rhythm, melody, harmony, tone color and structure and dynamics and many other aesthetic considerations; its basis, sound, is essentially one dimensional.  It consists in variations in air pressure over time.  Were that not so, recording on disks or tapes (whether analog or digital) would not be possible.  It is due to the limitations of our sense organs that we perceive slower variations as rhythm, medium speed variations (about 20 to 8000 Hz) as pitch and faster variations (about 40 to 20,000 Hz) as tone color, with the interactions between simultaneous tones as harmony.</p><p>On the other hand, painting could be described as a two dimensional art form and sculpture as three dimensional.  Mobiles could be described as four dimensional as they reintroduce the time element.  (Not everyone agrees that time is the fourth dimension.)  Videotape is based on one dimensional scanning at a rate slightly faster than our persistence of vision with a separate track for audio (or two for stereo).</p><p>Music, then, described as the physical phenomenon of sound, requires only two axes mathematically, with pressure variations above and below the &quot;x&quot; or time axis.  Imaginary numbers require an additional axis.  You don&apos;t need it.  However, from the physiological standpoint of perception, it could be difficult to determine how many axes or dimensions one might want or need.  But simply for a way to construct a scale, tempered or not, it would seem an unnecessary complication.  Would it yield an imaginary scale on which one could play imaginary music?</p></div><h3><a id=10429 href="#10429">ðŸ”—</a>ChaosMonkey &#x3C;chaosmonkey@vajravai.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2000 12:31:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Although...  purely mathematically generated music may not be a good<br/>substitute or true creativity - it shure is nice to listen to for<br/>inspiration.

Pinning down the exact point is difficult,<br/>because there is a somewhat nebulous area around the change-over, people&apos;s<br/>perceptions are slightly different, and speakers have a very tough time<br/>reproducing such frequencies reliably. (Stockhausen liked to play with this<br/>nebulous area in works such as Kontakt.) In my class, I often play a<br/>modulator tone slowly sweeping up in frequency and poll students as to<br/>where &quot;rhythm&quot; ends and &quot;tone&quot; begins for modulation. For most people, it<br/>seems to be at about the same point that &quot;pitch&quot; begins. If you have an<br/>example that demonstrates the independence of these perceptions for a given<br/>circumstance, I would certainly like to hear it.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
