Her lies a body of<br/>monophonic song written and performed throughout large areas of Southern<br/>and Northern Europe. I&apos;m not an Early Music expert, merely a performer,<br/>but as far as I can establish, the music transcended social boundaries<br/>and was played by the people and in the Royal Houses. There are several<br/>vast collections of melodies, transcribed by various editors in standard<br/>conventional notation. But who knows how these melodies were sung as<br/>they passed from composer to performer to the popular repertoire?</p><p>Now I find in an Early Music magazine not one but two references to the<br/>Arabic influence in medieval Europe. The first, a scholarly article,<br/>goes into written evidence of Arab and Sephardic influence and<br/>instruments. What is interesting is the portrayal of Southern Europe<br/>around the Mediterranean as being deeply influenced by Arabic culture.<br/>This opens up some fascinating doors for tuning.</p><p>The second reference is a review of a new young ensemble who are<br/>beginning to dig into the rich seam of Troubador song and liven up the<br/>songs  with a range of Arabic and European string, wind and percussion<br/>instruments. Someone has beaten me to it.</p><p>I find that this ties in well with Lou Harrison&apos;s description of Europe<br/>as &quot;North west Asia&quot; in the most recent edition of 1/1. I like this a<br/>lot because it&apos;s humorous and because European Art and culture need much<br/>humility.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3><a id=30427 href="#30427">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2001 9:09:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Alison,</p><p>&gt; From: Alison Monteith &lt;<a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 10:28 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] The Troubadors and Arabic influences in NW Asia.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I find in an Early Music magazine not one but two references to the<br/>&gt; Arabic influence in medieval Europe.
