Close approximations to consonant intervals are perceived as<br/>&gt; consonant also--for thirds, some people actually prefer slightly mistuned<br/>&gt; intervals, perhaps because of their experience with 12-tone equal<br/>&gt; temperament or because they like the richer and dynamic sound of the<br/>&gt; tempered intervals.

All theoretical models are evaluated based on whether they succeed with greater frequency than random chance (or than a competing model) at fitting established experimental data.  To become an accepted theory, a model must fit established data and successfully predict new data points more effectively than random chance or any competing models.  In other words, your model needs to be shown to have a higher probability of predicting consonance and dissonance than random chance, as well as a higher probability than any of the competing models (like harmonic entropy, critical band dissonance, Sethares&apos; sensory dissonance model, etc.).  If you reject probability out-of-hand, then your model and theory will similarly be rejected out-of-hand by any scientific community.  If you refuse to evaluate your model against competing models and/or random chance, then all of your claims about the superiority of your model will appear to any rational human being as &quot;unfounded&quot; and &quot;faith-based&quot;, the result of the worst kind of confirmation bias.</p><p>I agree with this 100%.
