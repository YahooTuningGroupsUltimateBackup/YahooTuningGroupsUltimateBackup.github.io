But if, like me, you prefer the unmerged version (where backwards and forwards flats have separate shafts which are merely close together) then it could be argued that this is not a new symbol at all and so this could simply be called the Stein set (even though Stein never notated a sesqui-flat). I note that George Secor and I prefer that the backwards flat is narrower than the forwards flat, so it looks more like a half of a flat. This modified Stein set is included in the sagittal font.</p><p>I really enjoyed this conversation. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=104541 href="#104541">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2012 10:20:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I hit the jackpot.

Here are a couple of paragraphs from my messages of 24 and 25 March 2010 (with my present comments in [square brackets] added for clarification):</p><p>&lt;&lt; In the chapter on fifth-tones and the 31-tone scale, [Gardner] Read discusses the symbols of &quot;Nicola Vincentino&quot; (sic, should be Vicentino) &amp; Fabio Colonna (pp. 116-117, with illustrations), and he also mentions that the semi-flat usually credited to Tartini (1754) was proposed by Quirinius van Blankenburg in 1739.  However, in Read&apos;s illustration of van Blankenburg&apos;s notation (p. 117) there is no sesqui-flat symbol shown.  Since Read is typically quite thorough about these things, I believe that this absence is significant and that we can conclude that the 31-tone sesqui-flat symbol (used by Fokker &amp; attributed to Tartini), and thus the underlying logic behind the fractional flat symbols, was indeed original with Tartini -- until proved otherwise.  (I believe that we have a parallel here with fractional flats in that: van Blankenburg is to Tartini as [Richard] Stein is to [Mildred] Couper; the former created [a] semi-flat symbol, while the latter employed logic linking the [new] semi-flat and [existing] flat symbols to [create a new] sesqui-flat symbol. [The parallel is not exact, however; read on!])</p><p>...  It&apos;s also clear that Couper devised the sesqui-flat (in [her composition entitled] _Dirge_) prior to using the (backwards-flat) semi-flat.  If we assume that she probably didn&apos;t know about Stein&apos;s symbols [since she reported that she got her fractional sharp symbols from Vyschnegradsky, without any mention of Stein], then we can probably also assume that she independently devised the (backwards-flat) semi-flat, since there is no earlier occurrence of it in Read&apos;s book apart from Stein.  Her name should therefore be used for the [fractional flat] symbol set, not only because she originated the sesqui-flat, but also because she originated the logical connection between the sesqui-flat and [re-invented] semi-flat symbols.</p><p>Â…  In case you&apos;re wondering, van Blankenburg&apos;s semi-sharp is a simple &quot;x&quot; and his sharp resembles a modern sharp rotated about 45 degrees, more or less [exactly what we find in Tartini&apos;s treatise, so van B. has precedence].  Also, no double-sharp or double-flat symbols are shown in Read&apos;s illustration, so I&apos;m concluding that van Blankenburg didn&apos;t propose any symbols altering more than an apotome. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I hope I haven&apos;t overly muddied the waters with all of this &quot;clarification&quot;. :-)</p><p>--George</p></div>
