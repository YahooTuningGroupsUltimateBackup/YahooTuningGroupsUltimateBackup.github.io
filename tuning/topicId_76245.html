Pelog is sometimes said to be related to a subset of 9-EDO, and in fact 9-EDO does make a good pelog scale. Mavila used to be called &quot;pelogic&quot; because of its pelog-like qualities; one way to describe mavila is as a combination of 7-ET and 9-ET. One of Easley Blackwood&apos;s microtonal etudes used a scale of 23-EDO which is basically the mavila scale.</p><p>Other temperaments related to 9-ET also have a variety of pelog scales; I&apos;ve used bug temperament (which tempers out 27/25) as a pelog approximation, and orwell also has a reasonable pelog scale.</p></div>
