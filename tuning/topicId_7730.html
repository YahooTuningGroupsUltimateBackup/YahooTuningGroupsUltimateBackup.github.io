My impression is<br/>that in an 8/7 second the upper pitch seems to be the &quot;root&quot; and in the 9/8<br/>second the lower pitch seems to be the root. Regarding the 10/9 second, I<br/>have often thought it would be interesting to construct a &quot;blind hearing&quot;<br/>test in which experienced musicians were asked to identify 9/8 and 10/9<br/>seconds as being scale steps 1-2 or 2-3 and see whether any consistency<br/>occurs.</p><p>In regard to singing a major second over a pedal, it would seem a given that<br/>the ear would like to hear 9/8--the drone being heard as &quot;root.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...the most natural &apos;tritone&apos; (for want of a less<br/>&gt; weighted term), is it 7/5, 11/8, 10/7 or something<br/>&gt; else?</p><p>The term &quot;natural&quot; may be a bit ambiguous here (see, Paul, I am listening),<br/>but it is quite easy to hear the difference between the 7/5 diminished fifth<br/>and the 10/7 augmented fourth. Today in my musicianship class I was tuning<br/>(locking) these randomly and asking my third semester students to identify<br/>them. They could readily do so by sensing whether the top pitch wanted to<br/>resolve upward (leading tone to tonic) or downward (chord seventh to third).</p><p>The 11/8 &quot;tritone&quot; is not related to the other two, I feel. Its most<br/>practical use, in my experience is to use it to color an &quot;augmented 11th&quot;<br/>chord, along with the b7th and 9th. It works there not as a functional<br/>tritone, but more as a timbral ingredient. I don&apos;t hear it wanting to &quot;go&quot;<br/>anywhere specific. I heard one the other day on the radio that was tuned<br/>exquisitely and appropriately &quot;in the cracks&quot; between 4 and #4. It was<br/>performed by a female jazz vocalist, but they didn&apos;t slate the recording<br/>afterward, so I don&apos;t know who it was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea here is that people who believe in greater<br/>&gt; importance for &quot;prime limits&quot;, &quot;odd limits&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;overtone series significance&quot; would probably see some<br/>&gt; different sorting.</p><p>You left me here, Bob. I&apos;d love to know what these phrases mean in layman&apos;s<br/>English, particularly the first two. Also, how are you using the word<br/>&quot;sorting.&quot;</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=7740 href="#7740">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Therefore, my use of the applicable low-number ratios is based on<br/>an assumption that these are likely appropriate. If it looks like a cat,<br/>acts like a cat, sounds like a cat, it must be a cat.

Also, realize that<br/>these students understand the difference between major and minor thirds. I<br/>think they are subjectively supplying a &quot;phantom root&quot; of 4:5:6 in<br/>imagination and in fact &quot;hearing&quot; a major triad.</p><p>Very likely, the same principle might apply to the 9:10 &quot;major second.&quot; It<br/>would be very interesting to know (as I mentioned earlier) to know if<br/>experienced ears can consistently hear 8:9 as scale steps 1-2 and 9:10 as<br/>scale steps 2-3.

I&apos;ll have to go back and see just what that tritone I was singing...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Others mentioned the 45/32, and I think that is probably a strong<br/>&gt; candidate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ooops, snipped your comments about 11/8. I do believe that this is used<br/>&gt; melodically. Before you joined the list we had some discussions with John<br/>&gt; Link regarding altered dominant chords or thier logical inverse,<br/>&gt; the &quot;lydian dominant&quot; sound 7 9 #11 13. In my experiments I was not<br/>&gt; convinced that this was properly tuned in the &quot;lower overtone&quot;<br/>&gt; manner, (7:9:11:13) but felt that the &quot;upper structure triad&quot; needed to<br/>&gt; be expressed, which would make it more<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              7/4 9/8 45/32 27/16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was somewhat convinced in these discussions that some of the big<br/>&gt; jazz chords I like are really coming more from the tempered world than<br/>&gt; some other.</p><p>Perhaps.

Once<br/>they sense and experience &quot;acoustic&quot; tuning, tempered tuning can no longer<br/>compete for their attention.</p><p>Regarding high harmonic ratios such as 45/32 and 27/16, do you really think<br/>human perception operates in that vicinity???

It seems to<br/>&gt; very difficult to find positive grounds for identify the interval with a 9:7,<br/>&gt; especially within a triadic context.</p><p>Thanks for your interest and your post. I&apos;m all ears at this point.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps we&apos;re framing the question wrong.  If, as a warm up, we were to sing<br/>&gt; the triad c-e-g, I might very well sing the &quot;e&quot; raised, in anticipation of<br/>&gt; moving to an f in a subdominant harmony. The exact interval of that raising<br/>&gt; need not be as important as the sensation of &quot;leading-toneness&quot;.  If,<br/>&gt; however, I sang that &quot;e&quot; following a dominant harmony, I would probably relax<br/>&gt; the intonation, seeking a restful conclusion on a 4:5:6 triad.</p><p>Keep in mind that the &quot;experiments&quot; that raised the question of the &quot;high<br/>third&quot; do not involve musical context. The observation is simply that when<br/>the fifth is introduced to a sounding root and third, singers consistently<br/>&quot;float&quot; the established 4:5 third well above the 12-tET tempered tuning. I<br/>have observed this consistently many times with many choral groups--most of<br/>them not trained by me.</p><p>I understand what you are saying about the tendency to raise leading tones<br/>and release tension of chord sevenths. It is entirely possible that these<br/>are often exaggerated by performers sensitive to these dynamic ingredients<br/>in expressive performance.</p><p>BTW, Did you see my post regarding the tunings of the third by Sheila<br/>Chandra? On the first track, she consistently uses the &quot;high third&quot; when<br/>preceded by scale step 4 (granted not in a V7 chord but over a double<br/>drone). This seems contrary to your experience, but I&apos;m anxious to gather<br/>all available opinion and experience on the subject.</p><p>&gt; It would be interesting if Gerald could record a choral group singing the<br/>&gt; same triad three times: (1) alone, (2) before a subdominant chord, and (3)<br/>&gt; after a dominant chord.</p><p>I&apos;ll make a note of this idea and work it in during the next week or so.<br/>(Semester began Monday and the new group is just getting organized.) The<br/>fact that the root of IV is a higher &quot;step 4&quot; pitch than the seventh of V7<br/>should favor your thesis. I&apos;ll let you know what happens. I need to get my<br/>MP3 act together soon. I guess I&apos;ll have to forgo a couple rounds of golf.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=7793 href="#7793">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Once<br/>&gt;&gt;they sense and experience &quot;acoustic&quot; tuning, tempered tuning can no longer<br/>&gt;&gt;compete for their attention.</p><p>To which Paul Erlich &quot;totally&quot; disagreed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I totally disagree, Gerald. Although the singers may indeed find &quot;acoustic&quot;<br/>&gt; or locked versions of these chords, many of them exist in the first place<br/>&gt; due to temperament, and the tempered versions that they&apos;ve heard over and<br/>&gt; over again without deviation all their lives are the ones providing a<br/>&gt; reference for what is &quot;right&quot;.</p><p>Paul, why do you continually &quot;totally&quot; disagree. Why not simply question the<br/>statement on some basis or other and give your reason for doing so. You<br/>can&apos;t logically say that doodlaboppins don&apos;t exist until you have<br/>experienced doodlaboppins not existing. My LA Jazz Choir, bless its little<br/>retired heart, sang hot jazz chords (even hot triads, for that matter) that<br/>a piano could only dream about. Now, if you are referring to vocal jazz<br/>groups that model after keyboard-tuned chords, you are likely correct; but I<br/>don&apos;t think these will be very exciting to experienced vocal jazz listeners.</p><p>You read my account in my &quot;Lies&quot; book of the development of the LA Jazz<br/>Choir, Paul. You know what I&apos;m talking about here. Singing tunings other<br/>than those learned from the keyboard was the whole reason for being of the<br/>Pierce College Jazz Choir and later the LA Jazz Choir.</p><p>The key phrase in my post was &quot;sensitive singers.&quot; So please don&apos;t<br/>generalize my reports of specific experiences in order to &quot;totally<br/>disagree,&quot; please. I suggest you slow down, read carefully, ponder a bit,<br/>and perhaps you will further expand your already considerable knowledge of<br/>&quot;Truth.&quot;</p><p>Respectfully submitted,</p><p>Jerry (AKA Gerald)</p></div><h3><a id=7889 href="#7889">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

His bizarre<br/>harmonic progressions are very much like the &quot;off the wall&quot; chord changes in<br/>jazz. I have to think that late Renaissance ears were essentially the same<br/>as our &quot;new&quot; ones, at least insofar as acoustical synthesis of<br/>simultaneously sounding pitches is concerned. And since keyboards (fixed<br/>pitch) were not a strong influence on what was essentially an &quot;a cappella&quot;<br/>(or viol/recorder) music culture, it would seem that Mother Nature was<br/>readily available to direct sensitive ears to optimum tunings.</p><p>I realize that &quot;authorities&quot; have proclaimed the &quot;mode o&apos; day&quot; of<br/>Renaissance musical styles, but I wonder whether they are any more accurate<br/>than today&apos;s music educators.

Do you<br/>mean to teach (condition) instrumentally produced (mathematically conceived)<br/>tunings to singers, and to induce them to forego their natural penchant for<br/>optimum acoustic tuning?
