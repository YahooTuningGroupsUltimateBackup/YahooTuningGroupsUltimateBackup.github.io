My<br/>neighbor said that singers cannot sing more than seven tones per<br/>octave. So I inserted notes PI, AG, UK, between C/D, D/E, F/G and<br/>started to practice the ten tone solfeo, there was no problem.</p><p>Next morning I brought the idea of much many tones within the octave<br/>where seven should be the pytagorean ones, the concept of a<br/>progression of cells started to born, its provisional name was derived<br/>from the inserted tones given above: PIAGUI.</p><p>At that time I went to the National Library of Lima where I did a<br/>selection of books containing musical chords information, I started to<br/>&quot;talk&quot; with Zarlino, Holder, Delezenne and other well known<br/>researchers on the improvement of musical scales. One of my findings<br/>was the &quot;schidsma&quot;, (32805/32768). It was clear that the progression<br/>tone spaces should not be equal and very small consonances were called<br/>to take part of it.</p><p>Now I will study your tentative findings on the Piagui tuning. Before,<br/>I have to pray to all the saints. Mr. Neidhardt, Mr. Marpurg, please<br/>accompany me.!!!</p><p>I admit that it seems that people had problems understanding some of<br/>my mathematical concepts instead of using simple procedures, which are<br/>compatible to the group.</p><p>Let me say that the half of a 9/8 tone equals (9/8)^(1/2) =101.955<br/>cents = K and not P, a nonimportant mistake. K and P were writen<br/>inversely.</p><p>You correctly wrote that K^8 * P^4 make sense due to numerical<br/>relations. Let me add that on pages 72, 73, 74, 75 of my book, without<br/>going to any chord property, that is, by pure arithmetical and<br/>algebraic reasoning, just by starting with the equations:</p><p>(A) .....K^m P^n = 2</p><p>(B) ..... m + n = 12</p><p>...........and once the two equations with four variables were solved,<br/> the three variants of Piagui scales were derived.</p><p>Regarding Chris Vaisvil pattern KKKKPPKKKKPP, it sins of being an<br/>asymmetrical set that might have been derived from the symmetric<br/>Piagui scales, otherwise he would have given the mathematical<br/>procedure that has been applied to get his arrangement.</p><p>In my opinion, any scale proposal should be backed by a mathematical<br/>demonstration.</p><p>I left for tomorrow the remaining analysis.</p><p>This evening I will sleep very well because I dialogued with a really lady.</p><p>Bye</p><p>Mario</p><p>November 08</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p></div>
