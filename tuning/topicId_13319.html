A far better<br/>rational approximation of the cents value is 1203&amp;13/37 cents<br/>(0.02% error), and a good one with low integer-limit and low<br/>prime-limit in the terms of the fraction (and thus a bit easier<br/>to calculate mentally) is 1203&amp;7/20 cents (0.4% error).  Finally,<br/>1203&amp;1/3 cents (5.1% error) is both much more accurate and also<br/>much easier to calculate than Kolinski&apos;s figure.</p><p>Kolinski justifies this tuning as follows:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... a basic aural phenomenon challenges this axiomatic concept<br/>&gt; of the integrity of the ratio 1:2:  acoustical tests on the<br/>&gt; evaluation of the octave [*2] have disclosed that the vibration<br/>&gt; ratio 1:2 is perceived as a slightly flat octave and that a<br/>&gt; widening of the interval corresponding to about two vibrations<br/>&gt; per second in the middle register is necessary in order to<br/>&gt; arrive at the perception of a perfect octave.  Further tests<br/>&gt; undertaken by Otto Abraham and Erich von Hornbostel [*3] have<br/>&gt; shown that the correction required for the double octave is<br/>&gt; larger than that for the single one.  This is not surprising,<br/>&gt; for if the adjustment needed for one octave equals _x_, one<br/>&gt; might assume that the correction needed for the double octave<br/>&gt; has the value _2x_, and that this value increases with the<br/>&gt; increasing number of octave enlargements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [*2] Carl Stumpf and Max Meyer, &quot;Massbestimmungen u&quot;ber die<br/>&gt; Reinheit konsonanter Intervalle&quot;, _Beitra&quot;ge zur Akustik und<br/>&gt; Musikwissenschaft_ II (Leipzig, 1898), p. 84.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *[3] Von Hornbostel, personal communication to the author.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Is anyone familiar with these references?  Or any more modern<br/>experiments in the same vein?  I&apos;d like to have more exact<br/>data on the perception of consonance; Kolinski here is rather<br/>vague... &apos;a widening of the interval corresponding to about<br/>two vibrations per second in the middle register&apos; doesn&apos;t<br/>quite give me enough to go on.</p><p>MY CALCULATION OF THE STRETCHED &apos;PERCEIVED 8ve&apos;<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>I&apos;ve calculated some figures on the assumption that by &apos;middle<br/>register&apos; Kolinski means the center of the audible range of<br/>hearing.  Of course, these frequencies vary for each individual<br/>and during a lifetime.  I&apos;ve pretty much just taken very rough<br/>approximate frequency-limits &apos;from the air&apos;.</p><p>If I assume 20000 Hz as the top limit _t_ of hearing, and<br/>10 &apos;8ves&apos; (measured as 2/1 ratios) below it, 19&amp;17/32 Hz, as<br/>the bottom limit _b_ (these numbers should be adjusted according<br/>to the more accurate data I&apos;m seeking!), the exact midpoint _m_<br/>is 625 Hz:</p><p>m = (SQRT(t/b))*b</p><p>Now if I take that 625 Hz _m_ as the midpoint (i.e., &apos;tritone&apos;)<br/>of the central &apos;8ve&apos;, I can calculate the top and bottom limits<br/>of that central &apos;8ve&apos; (measuring the &apos;8ve&apos; here first as a 2/1)<br/>as the SQRT(2) above and below _m_ respectively.  So I the top<br/>note of the central &apos;8ve&apos; is 625*(SQRT(2)) = 883&amp;53/60 Hz, and<br/>the bottom note is 625/(SQRT(2)) = 441&amp;113/120 Hz.</p><p>According to Kolinski:</p><p>&gt; ratio 1:2 is perceived as a slightly flat octave and that a<br/>&gt; widening of the interval corresponding to about two vibrations<br/>&gt; per second in the middle register is necessary in order to<br/>&gt; arrive at the perception of a perfect octave.</p><p>So I add 1 Hz to the top frequency, and subtract 1 Hz from the<br/>bottom frequency, to keep the midpoint of the central *perceived*<br/>&apos;8ve&apos; at 625 Hz.  This gives ~884&amp;53/60 Hz for the top note and<br/>~440&amp;113/120 Hz for the bottom note of the perceived &apos;perfect&apos;<br/>central &apos;8ve&apos;.  This interval is ~1205.879335 cents (about<br/>1205&amp;7/8 cents), which is a little wider than Kolinski&apos;s &apos;8ve&apos;,<br/>but somewhat close to it.</p><p>MY CALCULATION OF STRETCHED &apos;PERCEIVED BASIC JI RATIOS&apos;<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>*If* one assumes that the stretching function for this &apos;audible<br/>consonance&apos; is constant (but there&apos;s no reason to assume that!<br/>... let&apos;s see that accurate data!!), this result yields a<br/>constant stretch factor or ratio of ~1.0034014 = ~295/294.</p><p>This coefficient multiplied by the standard basic low-integer<br/>JI ratios gives perceived perfect consonances as follows:<br/>(== means &apos;equivalent [not equal] to)</p><p>&apos;8ve&apos;          ==  2/1  ==  ~1206 cents<br/>&apos;perfect 5th&apos;  ==  3/2  ==  ~ 708 cents<br/>&apos;major 3rd&apos;    ==  5/4  ==  ~ 392 cents<br/>&apos;harmonic 7th&apos; ==  7/4  ==  ~ 975 cents</p><p>All figures are subject to further adjustment when better<br/>experimental data becomes available.</p><p>Also, what about the timbres of the sounds used in these<br/>experiments?  Wouldn&apos;t they have a dramatic effect on the<br/>size of intervals perceived as consonant?</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=13324 href="#13324">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 8:06:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13319">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13319</a></p><p>Perhaps, then, music theory will have to be &quot;rewritten&quot; since with<br/>&quot;stretched octaves&quot; the harmonics of two pitches do not exactly<br/>coincide... so, therefore, &quot;parallel octaves&quot; shouldn&apos;t be quite so<br/>onerous (??)<br/>____________ ___ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=13336 href="#13336">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 11:25:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Is anyone familiar with these references?

The entire edifice of 12-tET serial<br/>theory is based on the assumption of &apos;8ve&apos;-equivalence, so if<br/>it turns out that this is not an accurate reflection of what<br/>we hear, then how much is that theory really explaining?</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that there is no value in that theory at all;<br/>I&apos;m an avid reader of those journals, and the theories do provide<br/>mathematical constructs that can have interesting applications<br/>in composition.

Much (probably<br/>the vast majority, actually) of past theory was proscriptive,<br/>and a lot of current academic theory is too.  But a lot of<br/>what microtonalists are doing is descriptive, based on analysis<br/>of actual performances of actual pieces - at least, this is<br/>how I try to ground my work.  See my analysis of a Robert Johnson<br/>blues vocal for an example:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a></p><p>So yes, I think music-theory will have to be rewritten, and it<br/>is already in the process of happening.  In general, what I expect<br/>we&apos;ll find is that there were important societal/cultural reasons<br/>why composers and listeners felt it imperative to follow certain<br/>&apos;rules&apos; in their music, and that these rules are forever in a<br/>process of evolution, because so is human society.</p><p>A book that I can&apos;t recommend enough, which will open your eyes<br/>to a lot of what I&apos;m saying here, is Richard Norton, _Tonality<br/>in Western Culture_, ISBN# 0-271-00359-6.  It attempts to present<br/>a Marxist view of the evolution of tonal perception from the<br/>ancient Greeks thru Schoenberg and his followers, with the<br/>emphasis on the *subjective*.</p><p>Another good one is Eugene Narmour&apos;s _Beyond Schenkerism_,<br/>ISBN# 0-226-56848-2.  This book presents Narmour&apos;s &apos;implication-<br/>realization&apos; model of musical perception, which I personally find<br/>to be *far* more relevant to the way I actually perceive musical<br/>compositions than anything in the millions of words Schenker and<br/>his followers ever wrote.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=13384 href="#13384">ðŸ”—</a>M.

One which I know of is the work of Carol Krumhansl, who has<br/>used multidimensional scaling of probe tone ratings to reduce<br/>high-dimesional &quot;distance&quot; metrics to, say, a two-dimesional diagram of all<br/>24 keys in Western music, showing their relationships with one another. See<br/>her psychology books or her articles in the _Harmony and Tonality_<br/>collection.</p></div>
