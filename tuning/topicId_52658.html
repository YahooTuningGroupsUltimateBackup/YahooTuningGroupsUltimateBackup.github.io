Carl, you made an<br/>interesting comment about additive synthesis in the digital medium, saying<br/>that it produced a &apos;sterile sound&apos;. Is it the digital or the additive you<br/>object to? Can you elaborate on your comments re:Bill Sethares&apos; music?</p><p>I was intrigued by the mention, months back, of hex lattices of various<br/>temperaments. I brushed up on postscript to make my own of 19-equal. I wish I<br/>had it during the composition of &apos;The Juggler&apos;. Things might have gone faster<br/>compositionally if I didn&apos;t have to do modular arithmetic base 19 (but then<br/>again, my choices might have, too--is that neccessarily a good thing?)</p><p>about Csound....Gene, to make no clicks happen on fast attacks, I think you<br/>have to instruct the wave not to reinitiate during legato, which gives a<br/>smoother sound, due to the fact that the signal doesn&apos;t make a dramatic jump<br/>in amplitude. Set the phase argument in the OSCIL opcode to -1, that should<br/>do the trick.</p><p>My biggest gripe with Csound is that the midi interface sucks, at least on<br/>Linux. Has anyone successfully NOT crashed their computer experimenting with<br/>Csound midi?</p><p>Monz, I hope you feel better...trust me on this--you want to get rid of any<br/>ear, nose, throat cold/infection? Two words---nasal douche!!!! tkae 1/4 tsp.<br/>of salt, mix with 1c of lukewarm water, and snort until you gag it out of<br/>your mouth--unpleasant, but it will cut your illness time in half. I do it<br/>everytime I get something, and I&apos;m much happier!</p><p>How &apos;bout the Democrats? We actually might beat Bush in November!</p><p>All best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--<br/>OCEAN, n.

So you&apos;ll naturally get subtle beating effects and complexities of timbre that take more effort to achieve deliberately with digital additive. Wavetable synthesis can only sound as good as the original samples, and can sound really awful if you can hear the looping of a sample. Increasing the pitch of a sample can make the loops more obvious. You can also get a &quot;sterile digital additive&quot; effect with wavetable synthesis by starting with a digital additive sample (such as the &quot;brass&quot; instruments of my Mizarian Porcupine Overture).</p><p>&gt; Sethares&apos; music may also get some of its sterility from the tempered<br/>&gt; timbres, though.  I think that&apos;s what I was trying to say in that<br/>&gt; thread.</p><p>The thing about the tempered timbres is that they lose some of their coherence as the partials go in and out of phase with each other. This tends to sound a bit unnatural with sustained timbres, but works well for plucked string sounds; the guitars and harps in Sethares&apos; music sound almost normal. Heavy use of chorus effects (like the flutes in Mizarian Porcupine Overture, which started as an actual recorder sample) can also help to reduce the unnaturalness of the sound.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/29/2004 12:05:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 11:23 AM 2/29/2004, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s a well-worn criticism of digital additive.
