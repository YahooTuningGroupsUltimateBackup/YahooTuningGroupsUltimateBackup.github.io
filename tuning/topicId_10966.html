It&apos;s really only<br/>the structural design and shape that is undergoing some metamorphic<br/>distortions and saturations... &quot;giving rise to strange creations,&quot;<br/>etc.</p><p>&gt; I tried some of the other chords you mentioned... but they really<br/>were too complex for my ear with this scale now... I&apos;m still trying to<br/>figure out what I&apos;m hearing in the basic major and minor tetrads!</p><p>Try the two harmonic and subharmonic pentads I gave and let me know if<br/>the both the major and minor chords now don&apos;t perhaps seem to serve<br/>equally as grounding points (with the stronger or smother of the two<br/>being the harmonic &quot;minor&quot; chord).</p><p>thanks for sticking an ear on it,<br/>Dan</p></div>
