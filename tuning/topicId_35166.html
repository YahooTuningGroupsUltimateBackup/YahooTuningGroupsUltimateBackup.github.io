Long ago in a post about<br/>the &quot;C-Fb-G chord&quot;, I ended up with a 5-limit approximation of 53-<br/>equal &quot;Turkish&quot; temperament.</p><p>And now, I have come up with 7-limit. The 4:5:6:7 chord could be<br/>described as &quot;D Gb A Ebbbb&quot; and yes that&apos;s an E-quadruple flat.<br/>That&apos;s using a &quot;circle of fifths&quot; notation. A more friendly<br/>description would be &quot;D F#- A C--&quot;, where the minus sign means the<br/>pitch is lowered by one comma, or 1/53 of an octave. The numerical<br/>expression would be &quot;0 17 31 42&quot;.</p><p>So here&apos;s the tuning:</p><p>1/1 = D<br/>81/80<br/>64/63<br/>21/20<br/>135/128 = Eb<br/>16/15 = D#<br/>15/14<br/>448/405<br/>10/9<br/>9/8 = E<br/>256/225<br/>8/7<br/>75/64<br/>32/27 = F<br/>6/5<br/>135/112<br/>56/45<br/>5/4 = Gb<br/>81/64 = F#<br/>32/25<br/>21/16<br/>320/243<br/>4/3 = G<br/>27/20<br/>256/189<br/>7/5<br/>45/32 = Ab<br/>64/45 = G#<br/>10/7<br/>189/128<br/>40/27<br/>3/2 = A<br/>243/160<br/>32/21<br/>25/16<br/>128/81 = Bb<br/>8/5 = A#<br/>45/28<br/>224/135<br/>5/3<br/>27/16 = B<br/>128/75<br/>7/4<br/>225/128<br/>16/9 = C<br/>9/5<br/>405/224<br/>28/15<br/>15/8 = Db<br/>243/128 = D<br/>40/21<br/>63/32<br/>160/81<br/>2/1 = D&apos;</p><p>I swear I&apos;ve seen this or something similar in the Scala files<br/>somewhere.
