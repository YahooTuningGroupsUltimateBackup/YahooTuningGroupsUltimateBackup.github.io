The<br/>veena ssems to have fixed frets, unlike the hindustani sitar, so it<br/>cannot be re-organised for each raga.  I do not have a very good ear,<br/>but it seems to me that the carnatic system has a variety of ragas.</p><p>Following teh details of hindustani music, I know that there are<br/>experts on carnatic music on this list (Greg S. at least) who must be<br/>able to lift the veil of ignorance from me, or at least tweak it.</p><p>==John ffitch</p><p>* TV Udaya, Bangalore where I am working this month</p></div>
