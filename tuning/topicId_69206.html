These weren&apos;t trascriptions to extended meantone, of the kind<br/>&gt;     I&apos;ve just done for BWB 542, but retunings with the meantone gamut moved<br/>&gt;     so as to correspond with the key.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Sour notes could occur in those because of a failure for the piece to<br/>&gt;     exactly fit inside the shifted gamut, a mistake on my part, or other<br/>&gt;     possibile reasons.</p><p>&quot;Failure for the piece to exactly fit inside the shifted gamut&quot; *is* enharmonically misspelled notes.</p><p>Like, for instance, the way the B minor fugue subject (WTC 1) all by itself in its first statement already uses 13 different notes.  The piece *cannot* work in any 12-note meantone set, since either the B# or the C natural will be misspelled according to the selected &quot;gamut&quot; (as you&apos;ve put it).</p><p>Another fun one is the C major organ fugue of BWV 547.  It goes along for a couple of pages, staying nicely inside Eb-Bb-...-C#-G#, and then suddenly we get a rackful of notes that aren&apos;t.

I&apos;ve found to my<br/>ears some things work better in one meantone and some in another. The<br/>narrower fifths of 31 certainly bring out the septimal flavoring of<br/>the above mentioned intervals more strongly, and also distinguish<br/>them from 5-limit sounds more strongly, as those are a bit sweeter<br/>than the corresponding sound in something like 74. However, I *like*<br/>that sound most of the time. It&apos;s less like what people expected, but<br/>arguably more consonant sounding. It certainly has more vwriety; the<br/>closer your extended meantone gets to fifths of 700 cents, the more<br/>it will sound like 12-et, which is about the blandest meantone sound<br/>ever concieved of.</p></div>
