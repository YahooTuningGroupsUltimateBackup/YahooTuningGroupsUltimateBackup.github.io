The playing is very intense, but also with a straightforward purity that allows us simply to hear everything that&apos;s going on.  Watchorn takes all repeats (3 discs for scarcely the price of 2), and the instruments and tuning sound astounding.</p><p>Some of the keys that sound especially beautiful and poignant to me here, in comparison with other recordings: C minor, C# minor, Eb major, D# minor, E major, F major, F minor, F# major, F# minor, Ab major, G# minor, Bb major, and B major.  The Affekt in the performance goes far beyond what one ordinarily hears in this music.  There is furthermore an uncommonly strong sense of linear motion, but without sounding pressed.</p><p>In some of the fugues, for a big finish, Watchorn brings in 16-foot pedal...and it&apos;s like that goosebump spot in the B minor Mass&apos;s &quot;Gratias agimus tibi&quot; and &quot;Dona nobis pacem&quot; where the timpani accentuate a subject entrance.  Really thrilling music.</p><p>I haven&apos;t seen the booklet yet, but I believe he&apos;s reusing my essay from book 1 of a few years ago, as he did with the inventions/sinfonias.</p><p>Recording details:<br/><a href="http://www.musicaomnia.org/PDF/mo0202.pdf">http://www.musicaomnia.org/PDF/mo0202.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://www.musicaomnia.org/index2.htm">http://www.musicaomnia.org/index2.htm</a></p><p>Book 1 and the inventions/sinfonias:<br/><a href="http://www.musicaomnia.org/bachharpsichord.asp">http://www.musicaomnia.org/bachharpsichord.asp</a></p><p>Enjoy,</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
