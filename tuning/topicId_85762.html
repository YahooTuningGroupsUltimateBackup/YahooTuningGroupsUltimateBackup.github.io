Now while  I<br/>did not direct the ensemble of  vocalists, I hear plenty of the  enharmonic<br/>genus...but nearer the end of the piece.  The work begins in the  diatonic<br/>(intentionally without microtones...although not in equal temperament),<br/>through the chromatic (again, intentionally without microtones...yet not in<br/>equal temperament), to the enharmonic (which I believe your ears have missed<br/>them).</p><p>&quot;I just got the Pitch CD &apos;Classic&apos; from AFMM that I&apos;d ordered. On it is the<br/> world<br/>premiere recording of the famous microtonal composition &apos;Musica prisca<br/>caput&apos;<br/>that I&apos;d eagerly been waiting to hear. To my great disappointment, the<br/>piece is<br/>sung without the microtones!&quot;</p><p>&quot;but I think it is highly misleading that the American Festival of<br/>Microtonal Music puts out<br/>a recording of a historical work famous for its  use of &apos;enharmonic&apos;<br/>intervals -<br/>without them.&quot;</p><p>Yes, it would be, but perhaps not as misleading as your reflex reaction<br/>that missed what I hear as microtonal, hmmn?</p><p>&quot;In addition, the first ten bars are left out in the  recording.<br/>There may be explanations to these issues on the liner notes which<br/>according to<br/>the CD cover should be on the afmm web pages - but I couldn&apos;t  find them.<br/>Could Johnny Reinhardt share some light on this?&quot;<br/>Juhani  N.&quot;</p><p>You can read all the notes on CD Baby, which I announced yesterday on this<br/>list.</p><p>For the CLASSIC album, go to:<br/>_http://cdbaby.com/cd/bbbtwv_ (<a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/bbbtwv">http://cdbaby.com/cd/bbbtwv</a>)<br/>As for the missing introductory measures: I didn&apos;t feel that the<br/>composition lost anything without the introduction.  The same is true for the<br/>Werckmeister solo, and<br/>to a certain extent, the excerpt of the Bach &quot;Musical Offering&quot; canons.<br/>Maybe your imagination of the piece was trumped by what you actually heard,<br/>as it was performed in a most relaxed manner.<br/>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=85763 href="#85763">ðŸ”—</a>Juhani &#x3C;jnylenius@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2010 10:42:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Johnny,</p><p>thank you for your reply. I admit that I was afraid that you&apos;d say the microtones are there but I missed them.</p><p>&gt;The work begins in the  diatonic<br/>&gt; (intentionally without microtones...although not in equal temperament),<br/>Yes. It sounds the way I expected.<br/>&gt; through the chromatic (again, intentionally without microtones...yet not in<br/>&gt; equal temperament),<br/>Yes. That section sounds as expected, too, while being rather adventurous harmonically, in the avant-garde style of the time.<br/> to the enharmonic (which I believe your ears have missed<br/>&gt; them).</p><p>I do hear some unusual inflections in places. It might be that the singers&apos; voices make it harder to hear the small intervals. But these inflections are much smaller microintervals than Vicentino&apos;s diesis, or 1/5 tone, aren&apos;t they? There is a lot of music for acoustic instruments or singers that makes use intervals around that size and I certainly have no difficulties in telling the pitches apart. In Vicentino&apos;s piece, there are passages where an un-dotted note is followed by a dotted note, indicating an ascending diesis, and in the recording I hear the same pitch repeated. My ears might be playing tricks and maybe my solf&egrave;ge needs more work but I doubt the singers here sing the enharmonic interval intended by Vicentino.</p><p>&gt; Maybe your imagination of the piece was trumped by what you actually heard,<br/>&gt; as it was performed in a most relaxed manner.</p><p>There are MIDI versions of Vicentino&apos;s piece online, and I&apos;ve also played the examples in his book on my Tonal Plexus microtonal synth, so maybe I&apos;m thinking too much in terms of fixed-pitch instruments. But then, it is my understanding that  Vicentino&apos;s motet would have been possible to play on his Archicembalo.</p><p>Juhani</p></div><h3><a id=85764 href="#85764">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>1/18/2010 3:35:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At some time I will go back to the recording, but for now, suffice to say,<br/>it has been found beautiful.</p><p>Juhani, there is a strange phenomenon I have experienced throughout my<br/>lifetime.

I think you are right after all.  But damn if<br/>&gt; the recording doesn&apos;t sound beautiful.  After listening to Margot&apos;s<br/>&gt; performance, I agree that the players played it WAY too safe (to say<br/>&gt; the least).  I may have to issue a disclaimer on these seconds of<br/>&gt; music.  &quot;I had considered the loss of the opening measures to be the<br/>&gt; equivalent of a wardrobe malfunction.&quot;  I guess I was bamboozled by<br/>&gt; the phenomenon I was describing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a result, I am planning a new performance of this piece for May<br/>&gt; 15, 2010 as part of the AFMM concert.  The only way to be sure the<br/>&gt; tuning is right now is for me to sing in the group, and to find my<br/>&gt; ensemble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear John,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you list the the enharmonic tones in Vicentino&apos;s score, as printed<br/>&gt; in the<br/>&gt; English translation of his book.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid I still don&apos;t hear the singers on the CD performing those<br/>&gt; intervals -<br/>&gt; only some microtonal inflections in places. The diesis steps (ca.<br/>&gt; 1/5 tone, or<br/>&gt; 41 cents) are very clear in Margo Schulter&apos;s MIDI version, here:<br/>&gt; <a href="https://lists.wu-wien.ac.at/pipermail/earlym-l/2005-February/000849.html">https://lists.wu-wien.ac.at/pipermail/earlym-l/2005-February/000849.html</a><br/>&gt; For instance, in the last four bars, the soprano line is supposed to<br/>&gt; ascend<br/>&gt; microtonally, thus: diesis - diesis - diesis - diesis - small<br/>&gt; halfstep (ca.<br/>&gt; 70c).<br/>&gt; Patrizio Barbieri has another transcription of the piece, both as<br/>&gt; notation and<br/>&gt; MIDI rendition, in his book Enharmonic Instruments and Music, which<br/>&gt; differs in a<br/>&gt; couple of details but it is basically the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you saying that the singers on the PITCH CD take the diesis<br/>&gt; steps as<br/>&gt; fifth-tones, as in Vicentino&apos;s theory and on the MIDI files? Aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; they rather<br/>&gt; intoning them freely, with much smaller intervals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yours,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Juhani<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=85819 href="#85819">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>1/23/2010 8:44:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oz:  The reason to be wary of claims concerning the pinpointing of<br/>executed pitches by ear without the backing of empirical measurements and<br/>scientific analysis tools becomes ever more apparent.</p><p>Johnny:  Not so sure.  Scientific analysis is not the issue  here.  I&apos;ll<br/>have to speak with those involved.  But I certainly  succumbed to the<br/>phenomenon we were discussing.  Time to sing it myself.  :)</p><p>Oz:  Well-studied and painstakingly rendered musics will seldom sound<br/>outright ugly. That is to be expected. But is the production of &quot;beautiful<br/>sounds&quot; the only goal in the realization of a faithful rendition of a microtonal<br/> piece?</p><p>Johnny: There is a difference in performing a piece of music that<br/>grotesquely emphasizes microtones amidst so-called &quot;regular&quot; notes.   When all the<br/>notes are organically in a music fabric.  In the case of the  Vicentino<br/>recording, the dotted microtones were simply not turned on.  I  did not expect,<br/>as Juhani did, the microtonal distinctiveness that Margot&apos;s  version<br/>established. Certainly, beautiful sounds is not a requirement for  microtonal music.<br/> But Renaissance music sung justly does sort of fit the  beautiful<br/>stereotype.</p><p>Oz: Should we not humbly admit that there might certainly be gross  errors<br/>committed by executants during such performances without them even<br/>realizing?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>Johnny:  On rare occasion.  But Juhani has pointed out something  else, a<br/>non-reading of the dot notation.  It is still a subtle  usage of microtones<br/>by Vicentino because it is mostly shifting just chords up  and down a dieses.</p><p>very best, Johnny</p></div>
