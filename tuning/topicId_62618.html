Acoustic instruments can clearly project intervals up to at least a 13 limit, regardless of the decimal points, phase shifting, etc. A few examples : in Ben Johnston&apos;s Suite for Microtonal Piano (which has been recorded) intervals of 7 &amp; 11 are clear and convincing (the tuning is actually 19-limit); brass instruments can more or less easily play up to at least 13 (up to 23 on horn) (also, valves can be tuned subharmonically, e.g. to give 1/16:1/17:1/18...1/22); on my cello (which I just got last month) I can reach the 31st harmonic, intervals of 11 &amp; 13 are clearly consonant, and I&apos;ve even been able to tune a 17:1 beat-free.<br/>  Complexity and voicing of the interval applies, of course; an 11:4 is much easier to tune than an 11:9, etc. Doubtlessly there are limitations, also - I&apos;ve heard chords like 11:13:15:17:19 sound audibly beat-free electronically, but it may be a bit of a stretch for acoustic instruments!
