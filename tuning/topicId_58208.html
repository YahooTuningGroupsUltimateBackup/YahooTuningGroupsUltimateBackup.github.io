I had been experimenting off-and-on with tuning systems involving transcendent numbers. The most famous of these constants are e (~ 2.71828) and pi (~ 3.14159). I tried different equal divisions of both e and pi, but I found something else that interested me: if I produce a Pythagorean-type scale using pi (or e) as the period, and e (or pi/e) as the generator, I get something like 53-EDO, but with the octave stretched by about 7.3 cents.</p><p>So here is my tuning explained in brief:</p><p>The &quot;octave&quot; is defined as e/1, approximately 1731.23 cents. Pi/1, about 1981.80 cents, can be called a &quot;nonave&quot;.</p><p>The difference between these two intervals, pi/e (~ 250.561 cents), is called a &quot;tone&quot;. Because there are almost seven tones in an &quot;octave&quot; (about 6.90942 tones, precisely), I chose the name for e/1.</p><p>But seven tones is sharp of an octave by pi^7/e^8, about 22.6951 cents. Because of its similarity to both the Pythagorean and syntonic commas, as well as the 53rd root of 2 (the &quot;Turkish comma&quot;), I call it the &quot;comma&quot; as well. There are about 11.0403 commas in a tone.</p><p>Finally, one special small interval, e^87/pi^76, is about 0.915261 cents. I call that the &quot;schisma&quot;. There are about 24.7963 schismas in a comma.</p><p>The nominals for the tones could be the letters A through G. But I personally like to use the first seven letters of the common Semitic alphabet to avoid confusion with the conventional understanding of the note names. I&apos;ll use Hebrew letters here (but their Arabic or Syriac equivalents could be used):</p><p>&#x5D0; aleph ~ 0.000 cents<br/>&#x5D1; beth ~ 250.561<br/>&#x5D2; gimel ~ 501.123<br/>&#x5D3; daleth ~ 751.684<br/>&#x5D4; he ~ 1002.245<br/>&#x5D5; waw ~ 1252.807<br/>&#x5D6; zayin ~ 1503.368</p><p>The distance between each of these seven tones is the same, but between &#x5D6; and &#x5D0;, it&apos;s a tone minus a comma, a &quot;small tone&quot; of around 227.866 cents.</p><p>For comma differences, I haven&apos;t really come up with a good notation, but right now I&apos;ll use +/- number of commas. For example, the stretched octave I mentioned earlier is notated &#x5D5;&lrm;-2, or waw minus two commas. Schisma shifts are notated in a similar manner, but if a tone is raised or lowered by schismas but not commas, it is necessary to add +0 or -0 as a comma modifier.</p><p>Finally, about standard tuning. Since the scale is not octave based (not 2/1-octave based anyway), I chose to define &quot;middle aleph&quot; according to Planck&apos;s time, a fundamental in quantum physics. (It&apos;s the amount of time a photon takes to travel the length of itself - about 5.39121&times;10^-44 seconds, give or take.) My recommended tuning for middle-aleph is Planck&apos;s frequency divided by e^94, or around 278.376 Hz. (That&apos;s about a middle C-sharp.)</p><p>This tuning I tentatively call &quot;e-pi tuning&quot;, unless you want to call it something else. Like the &quot;Geek scale&quot;. ;)</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3><a id=58210 href="#58210">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2005 9:51:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I mentioned this on tuning-math a little bit.

By the Gelfond-Schneider theorem, this is a<br/>transcendental number and the same is true of the whole metallic<br/>family. Aside from that, we have the Lucy-tuned major third of<br/>2^(1/pi), which is almost certainly a transcendental number, though I<br/>know of no proof, and Margo&apos;s e-fifth, which is 2^((4+3e)/(7+5e)),<br/>again almost certainly a transcendental number.</p><p>Taken as a musical interval, pi is pretty much random.

If we insist for some<br/>bizarre reason that the 22/7 of this system be exactly pi, then the<br/>major third<br/>must be sqrt(pi/2), so the fifth has to be (8 pi)^(1/8). This is a<br/>fine pi in the eye fifth for anyone bored with Lucy tuning; it&apos;s close<br/>to 1/5 comma (12/61 comma if you want to get fussy about it) and even<br/>closer to 43-et, over which it holds no advantage at all, unless you<br/>think the circle of fifths not closing and the fifth being a<br/>transcendental number are advantages.</p></div>
