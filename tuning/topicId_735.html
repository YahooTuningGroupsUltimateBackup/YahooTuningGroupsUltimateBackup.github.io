Southwest<br/>also<br/>&gt;tried to substitute any other work of his choice on the program, but again<br/>&gt;got no response. So, we are instead doing an Ives group: several of the<br/>&gt;songs, plus the 4th violin sonata (no alternate tunings there; no<br/>&gt;lawyers...!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[U&#xFFFD;tu guno&#xFFFD;men] . . . would I were<br/>&gt;In Grantchester, in Grantchester! -- -<br/>&gt;Some, it may be, can get in touch<br/>&gt;With Nature there, or Earth, or such.<br/>&gt;And clever modern men have seen<br/>&gt;A Faun a-peeping through the green,<br/>&gt;And felt the Classics were not dead,<br/>&gt;To glimpse a Naiad&apos;s reedy head,<br/>&gt;Or hear the Goat-foot piping low: . . .<br/>&gt;But these are things I do not know.<br/>&gt;I only know that you may lie<br/>&gt;Day long and watch the Cambridge sky,<br/>&gt;And, flower-lulled in sleepy grass,<br/>&gt;Hear the cool lapse of hours pass,<br/>&gt;Until the centuries blend and blur<br/>&gt;In Grantchester, in Grantchester. . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When I first heard Ives recasting of these words so many years ago, I felt<br/>a<br/>&gt;familiar wrench at the pit of my stomach&#xFFFD; And though I had little doubt<br/>then<br/>&gt;(nor do I now) that arts often non-linear &#xFFFD;detachments from the physically<br/>&gt;exact&#xFFFD; hinge on a threadbare kinship of conjunct interpretation (subject to<br/>&gt;all the myriad anthropocentric contrarieties and vagaries of the general<br/>&gt;matter-of-course&#xFFFD;), that Ives could so clearly _hear_ HIS music in this<br/>very<br/>&gt;particular excerpt from Rupert Brooke&#xFFFD;s (curious) poem* spoke volumes to me<br/>&gt;as a young man about the confident navigation of certain fundamental<br/>&gt;antilogies of intellect and creativity; of understanding and attentive<br/>&gt;misunderstand&#xFFFD; For the most part I stopped listening to much music (apart<br/>&gt;from that which I am personally in the process of working on) some time<br/>&gt;ago - and yet I often find myself returning to Ives&#xFFFD; For his music has<br/>&gt;remained with me as a consistent _and remarkably flexible_ source of<br/>&gt;inspiration.** The great SOBERING jolts I&apos;d known since I was a very young<br/>&gt;boy sitting on the fence in his backyard under nothing more than the<br/>&gt;palliating athwart of an altostratus sky hung over Proctor School early one<br/>&gt;summer Sunday evening after dinner have seldom found a more confident<br/>&gt;reinforcement than the type I would glean from the &apos;Grantchester coda.&#xFFFD;***<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;THE PEACE OF GOD IN FIVE FLATS<br/>&gt;In the original context of Rupert Brooke&apos;s curious poem,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;hear the cool lapse of hours pass,<br/>&gt;until the centuries blend and blur&#xFFFD;&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;unquestionably &apos;jumps of the page&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Yet it is through the unique prism of<br/>&gt;Ives genius, that the equilibrium is altogether recast. And like another of<br/>&gt;Ives songs, Autumn (while plenty inspiriting enough in its straightforward<br/>&gt;interwoven historical testimony of two persons love and indelible<br/>&gt;understanding&#xFFFD;), the great sobering close brings more than the linear sum<br/>of<br/>&gt;its quantifiable components [i.e., more than &quot;the peace of God&#xFFFD;&quot; in five<br/>&gt;flats!]&#xFFFD; Charlie and Harmony&apos;s Autumn---Gods Autumn---Natures<br/>&gt;Autumn------TIMES Autumn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;IN SOME DEEP CURRENT OF THE SUNLIT BROWN<br/>&gt;When I look into the darkness of the dense trees I may only see the shadows<br/>&gt;and de-articulating blur of trunks and branches... But I feel something<br/>&gt;else. Focus and openness are in often antagonistic denial of each other.<br/>(To<br/>&gt;the extent that taking a forceful position for one so often seems to<br/>obviate<br/>&gt;the salient attributes of the other, and more often than not leads to some<br/>&gt;oddly inattentive extremity of strident pedantic arrogance or numinous<br/>&gt;_dogmatic_ unbosoming&#xFFFD;). Confident reinforcement of the sort I would glean<br/>&gt;from the music of Charles Ives certainly helped me... And the more I look<br/>&gt;back on it -- the more grateful I am.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Contented river!<br/>&gt;And yet over-shy<br/>&gt;To mask thy beauty from the eager eye;<br/>&gt;Hast thou a thought to hide from field and town?<br/>&gt;In some deep current of the sunlit brown&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&quot; [Robert Underwood Johnson]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Respectfully,<br/>&gt;Dan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;*The Old Vicarage, Grantchester<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;**Pieces such as The (orchestral) Housatonic and the fourth symphony finale<br/>&gt;unquestionably lead me directly towards a more decisive and thoroughgoing<br/>&gt;commitment to &#xFFFD;microtonality.&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;***From &quot;I only know that&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>&gt;to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>&gt;select the User Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;You do not need web access to participate.
