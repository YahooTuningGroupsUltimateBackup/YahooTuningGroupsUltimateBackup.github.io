It seems a<br/>&gt; real stretch to me to think that human ears hear in such terms.</p><p>But your own &apos;high third&apos; appears AFTER a fifth is introduced. Somehow, the<br/>fifth influences the singers choice of third.</p><p>You have clearly trained your ears to prefer certain sounds (in the latest<br/>listenning experiment it seems you preferred the &quot;low third and low seventh&quot;<br/>on the dominant chord where others thought that the 16/9 sounded &quot;most<br/>normal&quot;. I will not contend that &quot;most normal&quot; is &quot;most right&quot; for every<br/>musical context, but I don&apos;t believe I hear a lot of a capella music, outside<br/>of barbershop, &apos;flatting the fourth&apos; on a cadence). Meanwhile, I&apos;m sure<br/>there are lots of people who are locked into 12tet that would think any<br/>of the other options sounded out-of-tune.</p><p>Now for a few changes of subject.</p><p>I&apos;m very interested in how some of these issues<br/>are dealt with in the melody. For instance, singing in C, if the melody goes<br/>C-D-E, do you give any consideration to evening out the two &apos;tones?&apos; Does this<br/>contribut to arriving at a &apos;high third&apos;? Similarly, in C, if the melody is<br/>going G-A-B, lets assume a V chord, are the &apos;tones&apos; even and is the B a &apos;high<br/>third&apos; to the G?</p><p>And how do you deal with punning? For instance, the end of the bridge to<br/>the song &quot;All the Things you are&quot; has a sustained G# which crosses from the<br/>key of E (where the bridge ended) to the #5 on a C7 chord and becomes an Ab<br/>on the F- chord which is the vi in the orginal key (Ab) that we&apos;ve returned<br/>to. Would you interpret the &quot;E&quot; as Fb and the C7#5 is a C7b13???</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
