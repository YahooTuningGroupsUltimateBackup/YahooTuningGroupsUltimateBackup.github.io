The Atlantic Monthly Vol. LXVII, January 1891. p136</p><p>One of the Lost Geniuses</p><p>The telegraph announces the death in the city of Mexico, October 21st,<br/>of Henry Ward Poole, one of the oldest American residents of that<br/>city. It speaks of him as a man of rare attainments, and as having<br/>received the degree of M. A. from Harvard College. Mr. Poole was so<br/>unique a personality and so much of a public character that some<br/>reminiscence of him may possess interest. I believe he was a native of<br/>Danvers, Mass., but for some years the family resided near Worcester.<br/>I first knew him at Yale College in 1842, where he was a member of the<br/>class of 1815. His brother was a classmate of mine, and became a<br/>somewhat intimate friend, and the two roomed together. I do not<br/>remember that I made much progress in Henry&apos;s acquaintance at that<br/>time, although I saw him frequently. He appeared to me to be always<br/>intensely busy about something, and had a preoccupied air.<br/>At the beginning of his junior year he did not return, and as his<br/>brother was also absent for a while I lost track of him. I next met<br/>him at Worcester, at a house where I was visiting, and where he had<br/>called to borrow a volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica. I found that<br/>he wanted to consult the article on Music, and especially the<br/>mathematical portion, and that in regard to everything relating to the<br/>theory of music he was well informed. He told me that he was studying<br/>the subject of organs, and invited me to come and see him at his home,<br/>two or three miles from the city. I afterwards made the visit, and on<br/>this occasion I referred to our acquaintance in college, and asked him<br/>why he left.<br/>&quot;Oh,&quot; he replied, &quot;I was there for a temporary purpose only, and<br/>having accomplished that I left&quot;<br/>&quot;Well ?&quot; said I interrogatively, intimating that I should like to know<br/>more.<br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;I will tell you all about it, if you care to listen.<br/>The fact, is I have a taste, or I might say a natural aptitude, for<br/>mechanics, aiid I thought I should like to do something in a<br/>mechanical way which was worth doing. I investigated a good many<br/>mechanical pursuits, and I came to the conclusion that organ building<br/>was about the most difficult, and therefore the best worth doing, of<br/>any.<br/>&quot;Now, you see, to build an organ it is necessary to know a good many<br/>things. First of all a man should thoroughly understand the theory of<br/>music, and to do that requires a considerable knowledge of<br/>mathematics. It was that which took me to college. I didn&apos;t care<br/>anything about Latin and Greek and other things, but I did want<br/>mathematics, and I decided that I could get them in college better<br/>than elsewhere ; so I fitted for college. Of course I had to study<br/>Latin and Greek and other things, but I got the mathematics that I<br/>wanted, and although it took a good deal of time, on the whole, I am<br/>not sorry. Well, when I had the mathematics, that was all I cared for,<br/>and then I left.<br/>&quot;Now, in organ building a good deal of leather is used, and it is<br/>necessary to understand something about the tanning and<br/>preparation and finish of several different kinds of leather ; so I<br/>apprenticed myself to a tanner, until I could do a respectable job in<br/>tanning and finishing piano leather.<br/>&quot;Also there are the metal pipes. In order to understand them one must<br/>be familiar with certain kinds of metal work well, I learned that, and<br/>then filing, turning, forging, and finishing steel and iron,  in<br/>short, the ordinary work of a machinist. I did enough at that to be a<br/>respectable workman.<br/>&quot;Next, there is the ivory work that is a department by itself, and had<br/>to be learned; but I had done so many similar things that I found it<br/>quite easy. The cabinet work and the other wood work was more of a<br/>task ; for it is not only necessary to know all about working woods,<br/>but one must also know a great deal about the different kinds of wood,<br/> their peculiarities and possibilities. There is more wood about an<br/>organ than anything else, and everything depends on the kind, quality,<br/>condition, and workmanship of this wood. It took me a long time to<br/>master this, although I did not find the mechanical part difficult.<br/>There is some of my work. I made everything in that, and he pointed to<br/>a highly finished parlor organ which I had already remarked on account<br/>of its beauty.&quot;<br/>&quot;You made that?&quot; I said, doubtless indicating some surprise.<br/>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said he; &quot;why not? I ought to do as good work as another<br/>man after having learned the trade. Well,&quot; he continued, &quot;to make a<br/>rather long story short, I have mastered, I think, what there is to be<br/>known in this country about organs. Now I am going abroad to see if<br/>they have anything to teach me there, and in twenty-five years from<br/>the time I began I expect to be able to make as good an organ as has<br/>ever been produced.&quot;<br/>The coolness with which he laid out half of an ordinary business life<br/>to the purpose of acquiring an art almost took away my breath ; but I<br/>found that he was perfectly serious. No commercial view seemed to<br/>present itself in the matter. His one thought was that he should<br/>himself be able to build a perfect organ.<br/>Four or five years later, in 1850, Poole produced his Enharmonic<br/>Organ, which for a time attracted much attention in musical circles.<br/>His own account of it appeared in Silliman&apos;s Journal of Science ; and<br/>there were several articles in other magazines, and numerous notices<br/>in the papers of the time. As nearly as I can recollect, this<br/>invention was an attempt to give every scale perfectly, by having<br/>pipes that were accurately tuned for each scale, and machinery so<br/>adapted that all the scales could be controlled from one keyboard. B<br/>flat and A sharp would no longer be represented by the same sound as<br/>they are in the ordinary organ or piano,  which sound is in fact<br/>neither B flat nor A sharp, but a compromise between the two,  but<br/>each should have its true sound, and so on. Many thoroughly practical<br/>and scientific musicians spoke warmly in favor of the new instrument,<br/>but after a while the interest died out, and nothing practical came of<br/>it. Whether this was because the instrument was too elaborate and<br/>complicated for general use, or because no one took up the enterprise<br/>in a business way and applied to its furtherance the necessary capital<br/>and energy to insure success, I do not know. Perhaps no one does.<br/>Probably Poole himself lost his interest in it as soon as he had<br/>accomplished what he undertook.<br/>It was about this time that I met him, one day, in the railroad<br/>station at New Haven. While we stood talking together, a<br/>small bell, perhaps a porter&apos;s call or something of the sort, rang out<br/>near us rather sharply, hut not, to my ear, disagreeably so.<br/>Poole jumped as though he had been shot, put both hands to his ears,<br/>and looked wistfully at me, as much as to say, Let me know when it<br/>stops. I can&apos;t take my hands down until I am sure. Then, gradually<br/>recovering his equanimity, he said, &quot;Ah! we&apos;ll soon put an end to all<br/>that sort of thing. No use going through life in agony, when<br/>everything can just as well be made pleasant.&quot;<br/>&quot;No,&quot; said I; &quot;but how do you propose to do it?&quot;<br/>&quot;Simply have all our sounds musical,&quot; said he; &quot;easiest thing in the<br/>world. That bell, now, might be a source of absolute pleasure instead<br/>of throwing people into fits with its horrid din.&quot; And he proceeded to<br/>give his theory of common concordant sounds which should produce this<br/>elysium; but I have forgotten the details.<br/>After this I lost sight of Poole for a good many years. I heard,<br/>however, that he was in the city of Mexico, that he had acted as<br/>professor (I think of modern languages) in a college there, and that<br/>he was pleased with the country. One day, later on, I met him at the<br/>Athenaeum Library in Boston, and had a talk with him, interesting,<br/>intense, and iconoclastic as usual, about Mexico. During the<br/>conversation he took from his pocket a handful of brilliant gems,<br/>which he was apparently carrying loose with his knife, small change,<br/>and other articles. I remember among them some very large and<br/>beautiful rubies and emeralds, evidently of great value. Poole<br/>immediately went off into a dissertation on gems. Each kind had its<br/>history, and each individual stone its biography. He made it all very<br/>interesting. I referred to his old interest in music. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said,<br/>with a faraway, dreamy look, &quot; I had forgotten about that; so I had.<br/>How long ago it seems That was the last time I saw him. A few years<br/>ago, a friend of mine was about visiting Mexico, and upon his asking<br/>me if I knew any one there, I gave him a letter to Poole, knowing no<br/>special address, nor even if he were still there. My friend told me<br/>afterwards that he found him without difficulty. He was living by<br/>himself with a housekeeper and servant (he never married) in a small<br/>house with a considerable yard, surrounded by a high wall, and guarded<br/>by a number of dogs. At first there appeared to be some doubt about<br/>the visitor being allowed to enter, but he was finally admitted. The<br/>style of living, although perhaps not uncomfortable, seemed, to an<br/>American eye, very careless and helter-skelter. My letter was<br/>presented, but Poole was apparently not quite sure that he had ever<br/>heard of me. He said, however, that he had known and forgotten so many<br/>people that one more or less made no difference, and he began talking<br/>immediately on Mexican affairs, showing munch more interest in them<br/>than in anything that was happening at his old home.<br/>This was the last, I think, that I heard of him, until I saw the<br/>notice of his death but he was so full of resource and genius and a<br/>certain kind of energy that one cannot help wishing to know more of a<br/>life that must have been, to say the least, very picturesque.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2005 4:12:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;threesixesinarow&quot; &lt;CACCOLA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Contributors Club.
