Are you selecting<br/>&gt; discrete frequencies with your synth. rather than bending<br/>&gt; &quot;a la John deLaubenfels??&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t even have a synth.  All my musical instruments and<br/>equipment (with the single exception of my &apos;rational guitar&apos;)<br/>(and, thank the gods, also not my computer) were stolen out<br/>of my house by &apos;family&apos; that I was letting stay there, about<br/>3 years ago.</p><p>So any MIDI files I create now are done with Cakewalk, either by:</p><p>- clicking the mouse on the Staff Notation screen to enter<br/>  notes directly into a score, and then adding another note<br/>  with each &apos;real&apos; note, which I must later change into a<br/>  pitch-bend command in the Event List screen, and then editing<br/>  the pitch-bend amount to the correct number; OR</p><p>- (only useable for JI) using my little &apos;<a href="http://micro.cal">micro.cal</a>&apos; program<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/micro/micro.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/micro/micro.htm</a><br/>  to enter ratios directly into my score; the &apos;octave&apos; of<br/>  the note must then be edited.  This is much easier and<br/>  more user-friendly than doing it the above way because<br/>  the user only needs to know the ratio and duration of<br/>  the note - the pitch-bend is calculated by the program<br/>  and is accurate to within 2 cents; and the duration is<br/>  entered in the way that makes sense to musicians: as<br/>  fractions of a metrical unit - AND tuplets are supported,<br/>  which is *real* nice.</p><p>  The problem with &apos;<a href="http://micro.cal">micro.cal</a>&apos; is that my version of Cakewalk<br/>  is so old and memory for CAL so limited that I can&apos;t add any<br/>  more features to the program.  Hopefully more recent versions<br/>  of Cakewalk allocate much more memory to CAL, so that whenever<br/>  I finally get around to upgrading I can make &apos;<a href="http://micro.cal">micro.cal</a>&apos; much<br/>  more powerful.</p><p>&gt; The reason I ask is that it seems that my sound card is<br/>&gt; recognizing the tuning differences *much* more than it did<br/>&gt; for the deLaubenfels &quot;bending&quot; examples, and I was wondering<br/>&gt; if your underlying method was constructing &quot;from scratch&quot;<br/>&gt; rather than bending the 12-tET version.  My guess is that<br/>&gt; it is...</p><p>Well, I was going to say that, yes, it *is* very much a<br/>&apos;building from scratch&apos; method.  But I still have to start<br/>with 12-tET and add the pitch-bend to that.</p><p>I suspect that the question you&apos;re asking me here is &apos;am I<br/>using tuning tables to program a synth&apos;.  The answer, obviously,<br/>is no.</p><p>I used to do it that way when I still had my Yamaha TG-77<br/>(a rack-mount version of the SY-77, without the keyboard).<br/>Boy!, do I miss that axe!!</p><p>&gt; Also, I&apos;m sure everyone has heard your little tune on the<br/>&gt; &quot;Tuning Punks&quot; site, &quot;3+4,&quot; but if they haven&apos;t they should<br/>&gt; soon... Great little jazz tune... so  unpretentious and musical.</p><p>Thanks, Joe - glad you like it.</p><p>I&apos;ve gotten one serious complaint about it from its oldest<br/>and biggest fan: it&apos;s way too slow.  Well, actually, she also<br/>likes it better in 12-tET than in JI, but I suspect that with<br/>more familiarity with the JI version she&apos;d come around to<br/>preferring that tuning too.  But she complained much more<br/>about how slow it is: she says &apos;it used to sound like<br/>&apos;they&apos; (= me) were *JAMMING*, now it just drags&apos;.</p><p>Oh well, what can I say?... I like the slower version much<br/>better, and in fact, I think the faster version she likes<br/>had the tempo increased by mistake.  When I lost my Yamaha,<br/>I had to (and still have to) to edit all of my old MIDI-files<br/>to work on my soundcard, and even on the ones that that I&apos;ve<br/>&apos;finished&apos; editing, here and there some stuff got past me.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
