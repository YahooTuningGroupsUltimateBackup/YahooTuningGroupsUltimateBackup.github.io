Gill seemed to want to make a bigger case for<br/>&gt; &quot;octave equivalence&quot; than really exists...<br/>&gt; at least it seemed that way to me.</p><p>JG: Joe, I would say (of the posts which I have made recently surrounding the existing impressions and assumptions regarding a perceptual &quot;equivalence/similarity&quot; of octave related pitches) that - rather than &quot;making a case&quot; *for* an &quot;octave equivalence&quot;, I have attempted to explore every possible exception, uncertainty, and doubt (potentially indicated) surrounding the so often held and applied assumptions that &quot;a sub-octave equates to an octave equates to a raised-octave, etc...&quot;!</p><p>The purpose of asking these questions has been to explore the veracity of those assumptions. The reason for such exploration is that - if one is considering *basing* one&apos;s own thinking (about &quot;aural perception&quot;, and the sometimes alleged mathematic-musical relationships between them) on a *basis* including such assumptions as &quot;octave equivalence/similarity&quot;, then one has a legitimate interest in determining whether such assumptions are either &quot;universally accepted&quot;, &quot;accepted in certain limited cases only by certain persons&quot;, or &quot;universally unaccepted&quot;...</p><p>The inherent subjectivity of such &quot;aural perceptions&quot; [even relative to a single person - in various listening contexts, moods, and when armed with various sets of expectations as to the intended/desired resultant perception(s)] is problematic for those (ambitious, and perhaps foolhardy, souls) who endeavor to create mathematical viewpoints which they might posit (to the critical masses of reductionists in &quot;white-coats&quot; wearing &quot;pocket-protectors&quot;) have merit (substantiated beyond the level of, &quot;yeah, brother, I know what you mean, I can *feel* that Venus is in Uranus, too..., I can *feel* the the spiritual jetstream of mathematical *truth*&quot; as Harmonic Convergence shield us like a hyper-cube from the glitches and core-dumps of our minds&quot;, etc.).    :)</p><p>Now (while I am an electronic designer), I&apos;m no &quot;technocrat&quot;. This son of a philosopher (now you may be saying, &quot;ah, that&apos;s where he gets his ultra-verbose tendencies&quot;) with only average abilities in math/science (if that) has managed to manipulate numbers (transfer functions and frequency responses) in ways which have pleased his own &quot;aural mind&quot; [and that of a few others, though there are no universal &quot;solutions&quot; to (the illusory) &quot;problem&quot; of &quot;mapping pleasure&quot; (for its eventual &quot;mass-production&quot; by &quot;white-coats&quot;, of course, to be marketed by &quot;little technocrats&quot; wearing &quot;pocket protectors&quot;, just like the &quot;white-coated gods&quot; they so admire)].</p><p>However, my (and perhaps &quot;our&quot;) &quot;aural mind(s)&quot; are not amenable to &quot;manipulation&quot; for the purpose of suggesting, affirming, and thus retaining, the &quot;sanctity&quot; of *numbers* (whether it be for purposes of conceptual &quot;tidiness&quot;, &quot;convenience&quot;, or plain-old &quot;intellectual vanity&quot;). Musical &quot;behaviorism&quot; aside, we would all (I imagine, at least) prefer to think of the functioning of our &quot;aural minds&quot; as a &quot;process&quot; unique, unscripted, and (thus) *non-reducable* to equations by &quot;white-coated gods&quot; who aspire to &quot;know the unknowable&quot;, who aspire to &quot;package our dreams&quot; shippable in cartons marked &quot;Sony&quot;.</p><p>Let us, then, sing a song (in the &quot;key&quot; of our own choice) for those &quot;misguided modernists&quot; who would (so conveniently) slip our creativity, joy, and undefinable raptures into a &quot;neat little box&quot; (whether it be the ultra-sexy Archemedian solids which cause our souls to undulate with an impending &quot;sense of deep meaning&quot;, or the more common Freudian shapes such as tubular and toroidal). And now, bretheren, ... Lattice pray ...</p><p>JP Continues:<br/>&gt; I think you summed the whole issue up in about five lines<br/>&gt; back aways when you said that<br/>&gt; the concept of &quot;octave equivalence&quot; was somewhat<br/>&gt; limited...</p><p>JG: We must admit (must not we?) that - if &quot;octave equivalence&quot; is *limited*, then so are all of our assumptions drawn therefrom, and are all of the conceptual &quot;glass menageries&quot; which we are tempted to so admire (as they stand so neatly on our shelves and bookcases)???</p><p>I believe that I could count the number of &quot;theories&quot; (which I, in my naive role as &quot;student of the tuning lists&quot;, have seen), and which are *not* premised upon &quot;octave equivalence&quot; (however convenient that may be for the purposes of numerical analysis) on (less than) one hand...</p><p>For - if we are to find solace in &quot;throwing our theories at a wall, to see if they stick&quot;, how are we to &quot;know&quot; whether it is an (objective, verifiable, repeatable, blah blah) &quot;wall&quot; to which they adhere, or simply, a self-erected edifice to our own &quot;certainties&quot;.</p><p>Truly, a &quot;spot of brandy&quot;, and the ear of a &quot;sympathetic stranger&quot;, go along way towards allowing ourselves to convince ourselves that, indeed, we are the last in a long line of &quot;great medieval thinkers&quot;!</p><p>In allowing such edifications to live and breath within the confines of our subjective (but wanna-be objective) &quot;knowledge claims&quot;, do we not risk becoming a &quot;(petty)-tyrannical-majority&quot; by choosing to overlook the &quot;emporer&apos;s decided paucity of attire&quot;?</p><p>Your friend and associate,  J Gill</p></div><h3>unidala &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2001 2:44:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; to overlook the<br/>&gt; &quot;emporer&apos;s decided paucity of attire&quot;?</p><p>Unidala (wryly) points out that it should be:</p><p>&quot;emperor&apos;s decided paucity of attire&quot;    :)</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2001 12:05:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/32159">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/32159</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; JP Responds:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Hi Paul...<br/>&gt;  &gt; Well, of course... that&apos;s the whole notion of &quot;pitch class&quot;<br/>&gt;  &gt; in &quot;traditional&quot; set theory, etc., etc.<br/>&gt;  &gt; However, J.

J.!</p><p>Actually, on the way back from the library where I have been doing my<br/>postings, I realized that I had phrased this wrong.</p><p>You are trying to investigate the *assumptions* of octave<br/>equivalence, and it&apos;s made a very good read.</p><p>I guess what I was infering is that you thought that &quot;octave<br/>equivalence&quot; should really be a much *more pervasive* and influential<br/>phenominon than it is in order for it to work overall in a &quot;general&quot;<br/>case.</p><p>It seems to me you are really onto something here.  Of course, as<br/>Paul and others have stated, octaves are not really *equivalent* but<br/>only &quot;similar...&quot;</p><p>Sure helps to set up scales, though... or otherwise we would need, I<br/>believe, keyboards extending out into infinity!  :)</p><p>By the way, the classical &quot;White Coat Syndrome&quot; is a true medical<br/>condition.  When a doctor goes in the room of a patient and is,<br/>ostensibly, wearing a &quot;white coat&quot; the patient&apos;s blood pressure goes<br/>up.</p><p>Best to avoid any such situations if possible...</p><p>Happy New Year.</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2001 2:12:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; JP Continues:<br/>&gt;  &gt; I think you summed the whole issue up in about five lines<br/>&gt;  &gt; back aways when you said that<br/>&gt;  &gt; the concept of &quot;octave equivalence&quot; was somewhat<br/>&gt;  &gt; limited...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: We must admit (must not we?) that - if &quot;octave equivalence&quot;<br/>is<br/>&gt; *limited*, then so are all of our assumptions drawn therefrom,<br/>and are all<br/>&gt; of the conceptual &quot;glass menageries&quot; which we are tempted to<br/>so admire (as<br/>&gt; they stand so neatly on our shelves and bookcases)???</p><p>This is not a big deal, Jeremy. You are free to remove the<br/>assumption of octave equivalence (which is always taken to be<br/>_limited_ in the way I indicated anyway) and get rid of it, either by<br/>replacing it with a different equivalence relation or by not having<br/>any equivalence relations at all. No big edifice is going to come<br/>crashing down if you want to do that. But why have you seemingly<br/>given up on pursuing those matters which pertain to your own<br/>attempts to build your own theoretical edifice? It would seem<br/>much more productive if we were to continue with _that_.</p><p>&gt; I believe that I could count the number of &quot;theories&quot; (which I, in<br/>my naive<br/>&gt; role as &quot;student of the tuning lists&quot;, have seen), and which are<br/>*not*<br/>&gt; premised upon &quot;octave equivalence&quot; (however convenient that<br/>may be for the<br/>&gt; purposes of numerical analysis) on (less than) one hand...</p><p>This is simply false, Jeremy. I would say that, for example,<br/>Gene&apos;s understanding of pitch relations via multilinear algebra,<br/>etc., is not premised on &quot;octave equivalence&quot; in the slightest.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For - if we are to find solace in &quot;throwing our theories at a wall,<br/>to see<br/>&gt; if they stick&quot;, how are we to &quot;know&quot; whether it is an (objective,<br/>&gt; verifiable, repeatable, blah blah) &quot;wall&quot; to which they adhere, or<br/>simply,<br/>&gt; a self-erected edifice to our own &quot;certainties&quot;.</p><p>You are free to choose your own standards of verification, etc. . . .<br/>so let&apos;s get on with it!!</p></div>
