New<br/>&gt; variations on another&apos;s themes are the backbone of musical<br/>&gt; creation.<br/>&gt; No one has the right to forbid them, and the world is a more<br/>&gt; barren place without them.</p><p>I&apos;ve been keeping quiet in this debate so far, mainly because<br/>Jon Szanto is a good friend and he has very strong views on<br/>this, but I feel that I have to agree at least partly with<br/>John&apos;s opinion.</p><p>I can respect the fact that Partch was indeed an absolutely<br/>unique composer, and also the fact that any listener of his<br/>music deserves to become familiar with it in the way Partch<br/>intended (i.e., on his own instruments in a live performance).</p><p>However, as a composer myself, I must also state that I think<br/>there&apos;s nothing wrong with &apos;arrangements&apos;, &apos;transcriptions&apos;,<br/>or &apos;adaptations&apos; of a composer&apos;s music by other people.</p><p>Once I create a musical work, it&apos;s got a life of its own.</p><p>IMO, the most creative music that&apos;s ever been put on a rap<br/>album  was on Public Enemy&apos;s _It Takes A Nation Of Millions To<br/>Hold Us Back_.  Not one note was original.  The entire thing<br/>was blended from disparate samples of James Brown and others,<br/>and I think it&apos;s brilliant.</p><p>Another good example along these lines is John Oswald&apos;s<br/>_Plunderphonic_, which has been banned and is available on<br/>the web.</p><p>And of course, redoing someone else&apos;s tunes in your own way<br/>is standard practice in jazz and pop music. (The tunes are<br/>even called &apos;standards&apos;.)</p><p>&gt; And if Kronos makes a profit, isn&apos;t that ok?  Unless they&apos;re<br/>&gt; absolute hacks in their transcription, which for some reason I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t expect.</p><p>Ben Johnston is the person who actually made the transcription,<br/>and he&apos;s no hack.  I know him personally, and he knew Partch<br/>personally, and has too much love for Partch as a composer and<br/>as a person to intentionally misrepresent him.</p><p>I&apos;m sure that part of the reason he did this was to expose more<br/>people to Partch&apos;s music. (Another reason was probably to make<br/>some $$$ himself - just another aspect of being an American<br/>composer.)</p><p>[Kraig Grady, TD 181.11]<br/>&gt; Go ahead and do &quot;impressions&quot; of Partch or a homage that&apos;s the<br/>&gt; thing to do! It is not being presented as a variation.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>The important thing here is to present these &apos;arrangements&apos;<br/>with a banner proclaiming that they *are* arrangements, and<br/>not to imply in any way that they were intended or sanctioned<br/>by Partch.</p><p>Again, before the bricks start flying my way from Jon Szanto,<br/>anyone wishing to learn Partch&apos;s music absolutely should seek<br/>out a live performance of it on his own instruments.

Once again, you have to realize that<br/>Partch was a Greek Revivalist and created theater. A string Quartet is not<br/>a part of his theater!</p><p>&gt; Once I create a musical work, it&apos;s got a life of its own.</p><p>Hopefully your colleges wont throw them to the dogs.<br/>As for me, go ahead, I&apos;m used to it:)</p><p>&gt; IMO, the most creative music that&apos;s ever been put on a rap<br/>&gt; album  was on Public Enemy&apos;s _It Takes A Nation Of Millions To<br/>&gt; Hold Us Back_.

What does it say about an<br/>artist that they have to steal. So much for ones self esteem. I enjoy much<br/>more a horrible original turned into something great. Personally I thought<br/>that Nancy Sinatras and Lee Hazelwoods &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; would be the<br/>perfect basis for a mass in the 16th century practice of borrowing from<br/>popular music. listen to it It&apos;s just ready for picking! What do you think<br/>Margo!</p><p>&gt; Another good example along these lines is John Oswald&apos;s<br/>&gt; _Plunderphonic_, which has been banned and is available on<br/>&gt; the web.</p><p>Cleaver. All Very Cleaver. I am sick of clever! It is not the same as good<br/>art even though in our society they are often mistaken one for the other</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Kraig Grady, TD 181.11]<br/>&gt; &gt; Go ahead and do &quot;impressions&quot; of Partch or a homage that&apos;s the<br/>&gt; &gt; thing to do!

Anyway aren&apos;t there some good microtonalist whose music they should<br/>be playing!</p><p>&gt; Again, before the bricks start flying my way from Jon Szanto,</p><p>I&apos;m standing behind him with a wheel barrow. Better watch out for the PRA<br/>(the Partch Liberation Army) they are rougher than us!</p><p>&gt; anyone wishing to learn Partch&apos;s music absolutely should seek<br/>&gt; out a live performance of it on his own instruments.  But when<br/>&gt; is that happening any time soon?</p><p>The recordings are there too, but yes, it is theater. Allow it to be unique<br/>in the same way as Peter Brook presentations, or any of the other one time<br/>only theater events. Shadow plays, Performance art is the same way!</p><p>Briefly we&apos;re here, then we&apos;re gone!-Partch</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
