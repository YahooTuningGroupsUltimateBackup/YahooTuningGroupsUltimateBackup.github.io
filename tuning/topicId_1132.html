Depending on:<br/>&gt;1. Melody: what happens before, what&apos;s gonna happen afterwards.<br/>&gt;2. Harmony: what&apos;s happening on the moment itself.<br/>&gt;With a limited number of tones you get stuck when the piece of music<br/>evolve.<br/>&gt;Because, it seems to me, melody runs on other tuningrules than<br/>harmony..</p><p>&gt;I see one important reason to choose for a limited number of tones:<br/>&gt;It&apos;s the property of most musical instruments. They are pretuned whit<br/>fixed<br/>&gt;tones. ET12 or JI, it doesn&apos;t  matter. The number is fixed en limited.</p><p>&gt;So why not determine first how a piece of music should sound like and<br/>&gt;afterwards take the limitation of the instrument in count.</p><p>I would agree with that, with the caveat that we often need an<br/>instrument to create the piece of music in the first place.</p><p>&gt;I think you are right. This is the wrong list. If you ever find the<br/>right<br/>&gt;one, please let me know. I&apos;ll join.</p><p>Why that reaction? It sounds like you&apos;d like to talk about dynamic<br/>tuning algorithms, which many on this list have discussed, and which<br/>many of my discussions have had some bearing upon.</p></div>
