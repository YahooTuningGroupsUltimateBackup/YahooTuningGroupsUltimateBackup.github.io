Nice to hear from you.  The short answer is,<br/>I&apos;m not aware of any university music program built around<br/>alternative tunings of any kind anywhere in the world.<br/>But one thing about university is that you&apos;re supposed to<br/>be able to study what interests you.  And what we have seen<br/>in the past decade is an explosion in experimental music<br/>of all kinds -- consumer interest, academic interest, and<br/>the availability of tools to make it.  So you should find<br/>people at any university who at least know about microtonal<br/>tunings and would be willing to support you studying them.<br/>There are even a few places well microtonal composers are<br/>on the faculty.  Here are a couple links:</p><p>Bill Alves - Harvey Mudd College<br/><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a></p><p>Larry Polansky - Dartmouth<br/><a href="http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~larry/">http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~larry/</a></p><p>Bill Sethares - University of Wisconsin<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/</a></p><p>The experimental music groups at Stanford (CCRMA) and<br/>Berkeley (CNMAT) might also be worth checking out.</p><p>I once met a fellow who studied clarinet at UC Davis:<br/>Sam Torrisi.  That was back when Tenney was still alive.<br/>Anyone know what&apos;s going on at Davis these days?</p><p>Mills College in Oakland is the only college I know<br/>of to have ever had something approaching a program<br/>around microtonal music -- back in the 1980s when<br/>Larry Polansky was there.  Last I heard (which was<br/>over 10 years ago, sheesh) John Bischoff was in charge.</p><p>My wife attended Mills for a year in 2005, and it was<br/>really suffering (dropping attendance).  I wouldn&apos;t<br/>recommend it these days.</p><p>Hope that helps,</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=83897 href="#83897">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2009 6:36:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The following would definitely be good teachers, but it is also largely a question of the musical genre or style or tradition in which you want to work as well as your academic qualifications and financial resources:</p><p>Wolfgang von Schweinitz, CalArts<br/>Clarence Barlow, UC Santa Barbara<br/>Chris Brown, Mills College<br/>Jon Fonville,  UC San Diego (I&apos;m not certain that he teaches composition, but he does compose microtonally and, with cellist Charles Curtis &mdash; who works closely with La Monte Young &mdash; on the faculty, there is a niche for intonation studies at UCSD)<br/>Janice Giteck, Cornish<br/>Larry Polansky, Mills<br/>Bill Alves, Harvey Mudd/Claremont Colleges</p><p>outside of the US:</p><p>Jon Wild, McGill<br/>Christopher Fox, Brunel (Brunel&apos;s music department also has Richard Barrett and Partch biographer Bob Gilmore)<br/>Walter Zimmermann and Marc Sabat, Berlin University of the Arts</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div><h3><a id=83899 href="#83899">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2009 7:42:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The following would definitely be good teachers, but it is also<br/>&gt; largely a question of the musical genre or style or tradition in<br/>&gt; which you want to work as well as your academic qualifications and<br/>&gt; financial resources:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wolfgang von Schweinitz, CalArts<br/>&gt; Clarence Barlow, UC Santa Barbara<br/>&gt; Chris Brown, Mills College<br/>&gt; Jon Fonville,  UC San Diego (I&apos;m not certain that he teaches<br/>&gt; composition,<br/>&gt; but he does compose microtonally and, with cellist Charles Curtis<br/>&gt; &acirc;Â€&quot; who works closely with La Monte Young &acirc;Â€&quot; on the faculty, there<br/>&gt; is a niche for intonation studies at UCSD)<br/>&gt; Janice Giteck, Cornish<br/>&gt; Larry Polansky, Mills<br/>&gt; Bill Alves, Harvey Mudd/Claremont Colleges<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; outside of the US:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon Wild, McGill<br/>&gt; Christopher Fox, Brunel (Brunel&apos;s music department also has<br/>&gt; Richard Barrett and Partch biographer Bob Gilmore)<br/>&gt; Walter Zimmermann and Marc Sabat, Berlin University of the Arts<br/>&gt;</p><p>In Bern, Switzerland, there is Bernardo Grossenbacher:</p><p><a href="http://www.classicpoint.ch/kursangebote/grossenbacher-bernardo/view-details">http://www.classicpoint.ch/kursangebote/grossenbacher-bernardo/view-details</a></p><p>But it&apos;s probably not in english (but OTOH, who knows...)<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3><a id=83900 href="#83900">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2009 9:01:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello antseaji,</p><p>You might also want to check out the University of Miami&apos;s Music Engineering<br/>program, which I just graduated from - It&apos;s currently being run by Colby<br/>Leider, who is an electronic and microtonal composer in his own right.</p><p>Also, wasn&apos;t something going on at Boston&apos;s NEC...?</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Tue, Jun 16, 2009 at 2:18 PM, antseaji &lt;antseaji@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wonder if you can help me.
