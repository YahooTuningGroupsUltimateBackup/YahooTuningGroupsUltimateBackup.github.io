The staff notation and the<br/>system of 7 nominals with the # and b modifications as one moves further out on<br/>a series of fifths is pythagorean in origin, but has proven to work in the<br/>successive meantone and 12tet eras as well.  When the fifths are larger Just<br/>intervals (or larger than 12tet), the sharps will be higher than the neighboring<br/>flats, when the fifths are 12tet intervals, they will have the same size, and<br/>when they are smaller than the 12tet intervals, like meantone, 19tet or 31 tet,<br/>the sharps will be lower than the fifths.</p><p>A lot of confusion is due to the use of the term &quot;enharmonic equivalence&quot; in<br/>musical training, which is an historically awful misnomer, and leaves the<br/>ancient enharmonic genus without the independent dignity it deserves. Also, an<br/>over investment in training 12tet equivalences makes it more difficult to learn<br/>to play meantone repertoire, where equivalence is not assumed (take a look at<br/>the hand horn chart in the New Grove, or at Berlioz&apos;s chart for the concertina<br/>in his orchestration treatise for examples using meantone assumptions (i.e. #<br/>lower than b)in standard repertoire).</p><p>One of the sweet features about using the pythagorean notation for 19tet, for<br/>example, is that one can compose in 19tet using the seven nomimals and sharps<br/>and flats, and then prepare a rehearsal score for players more comfortable with<br/>12tet by just adding cent deviations from the same notation, but now reading it<br/>as 12tet.</p><p>I.e</p><p>19tet score   12tet score<br/>C             C<br/>C#            C# -37<br/>Db            Db +26<br/>D             D -11<br/>D#            D# -47<br/>Eb            Eb +16<br/>E             E -21<br/>E#/Fb         E#-58 or Fb +42<br/>F             F +5<br/>F#            F# -32<br/>Gb            Gb +32<br/>G             G -5<br/>G#            G# -32<br/>Ab            Ab +21<br/>A             A -16<br/>A#            A# -53<br/>Bb            Bb +11<br/>B             B-26<br/>B#/Cb         B#-63 or Cb +37</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=18701 href="#18701">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/14/2001 5:59:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; 19tet score   12tet score<br/>&gt; C             C<br/>&gt; C#            C# -37<br/>&gt; Db            Db +26<br/>&gt; D             D -11<br/>&gt; D#            D# -47<br/>&gt; Eb            Eb +16<br/>&gt; E             E -21<br/>&gt; E#/Fb         E#-58 or Fb +42<br/>&gt; F             F +5<br/>&gt; F#            F# -32<br/>&gt; Gb            Gb +32<br/>&gt; G             G -5<br/>&gt; G#            G# -32<br/>&gt; Ab            Ab +21<br/>&gt; A             A -16<br/>&gt; A#            A# -53<br/>&gt; Bb            Bb +11<br/>&gt; B             B-26<br/>&gt; B#/Cb         B#-63 or Cb +37</p><p>G# should be -42.
