Try and get me to understand that<br/>first.  Am I right in thinking that these scales are built up of 5 large and<br/>2 small steps?  That would be my definition of a &quot;5+2&quot; scale.</p><p>In that older post of your, you give a list of numbers under the heading &quot;w<br/>- h =2&quot;.  Those numbers are the series 3+7n where n is an integer &gt;=0.  The<br/>equally tempered 3t+4s scales I&apos;m considering at the moment happen to be<br/>those where t-s is one step.  Those scales have 3+7n steps to the octave.<br/>So, they&apos;re the same scales you previously defined as &quot;w - h =2&quot; in a<br/>different context.</p><p>The 3+4 scales, then, can be written as &quot;2w + 2h&quot;?  So, in this context, &quot;w<br/>- h =2&quot; is the set 6+7n.  That is 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, etc.  These are the<br/>examples you give, so am I right about the definitions?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Is this like what I&apos;d call septimally double-positive? That is, you start<br/>&gt;&gt;with a 5+2 scale, and these scales are the ones where the larger interval<br/>is<br/>&gt;&gt;2 steps bigger than the smaller one.</p><p>&gt;No. (Unless it also happens to be.)</p><p>What&apos;s that supposed to mean?  I&apos;m talking there about the scales originally<br/>defined as &quot;w - h =2&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;what&apos;s this stuff about exteriors and interiors and perimeters?</p><p>&gt;You could use n&quot;F&quot; sets of n&quot;f&quot; to explicitly define an exterior, interior,<br/>&gt;and perimeter sets of equidistant divisions of the octave for the 3 + 4 @<br/>+t<br/>&gt;+s +s +t +s +t +s heptad where n&quot;F&quot; = 7, n&quot;f&quot; = 3, and columns one through<br/>&gt;seven depict w - h = 1 through w - h = 7:</p><p>So, &quot;F&quot; is an octave and &quot;f&quot; is a fifth?  What do &quot;exterior&quot;, &quot;interior&quot; and<br/>&quot;perimeter&quot; mean?  I think I remember seeing them somewhere, but do you have<br/>a reference?  Are you trying to construct this pattern of notes from a<br/>spiral of some kinds of fifths, then?  A spiral of neutral thirds makes much<br/>more sense, but that&apos;s by the by.</p><p>&gt; 3          6         2          5        1            4            7<br/>&gt;10        13        9         12       8          11          14<br/>&gt;17        20       16        19      15         18          21</p><p>In this table, each row gets bigger by 7 as you go down.  The numbers in the<br/>top row get bigger by 3 as you go along, and are modulo 7, or near enough<br/>(should 7 (mod 7) be zero?) so this presumably has something to do with<br/>octaves and fifths.  But what does it mean?</p><p>&gt;Exterior set @ 2, 5, 1, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 14:</p><p>&gt;                        Es       Es       Es        Es          Es<br/>&gt;                                                Es        Es          Es</p><p>This means nothing to me.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The simplest examples of scales fitting this pattern are 7-equal, 10-equal<br/>&gt;(t=2 steps, s=1 step) and 17-equal (t=3, s=2). Also, 31-equal fits: t=5,<br/>&gt;s=4.</p><p>&gt;Ostensibly, an interior set would delimit the simplest n-tET examples of<br/>&gt;the particular heptads characteristic &quot;f&quot; and &quot;F&quot; properties**</p><p>Is this the definition of &quot;interior set&quot; then? In the case of my 3t+4s<br/>scales, t is equivalent to a major tone: it&apos;s the difference between a<br/>fourth and fifth.  You get s as the difference between t and a neutral<br/>third.  For the double-Pythagorean scale, you get t/s = log(3/2)/2log(9/8)-1<br/>= 0.721.  Then, s/(t-s)-0.721/(1-0/721)=2.59.  So, s should be about 2.6<br/>times the size of t-s.  If t-s is 2 steps, s will ideally be 5 steps and<br/>there will be 41 steps to the octave.  That&apos;s why the simplest scales are<br/>those where t-s is 1 step.  They happen to be the ones with a lot fewer than<br/>41 notes with good fifths and neutral thirds.  34-equal is the first to<br/>break the pattern I think.  This is all by the by, though.</p><p>&gt;Mapped to nS sets of nt, every n-tET&gt;ntnS/nSnt (i.e., 21tET) yields a<br/>heptad<br/>&gt;were h or (using your definition) s&gt;0 of the perimeter set, and s&gt;-n of the<br/>&gt;exterior set:</p><p>Right, so s and h are equivalent in our different systems.  Heptad means a<br/>set of seven notes.  The perimeter set, then, is where s is larger than a<br/>unison?  And the perimeter set means that s can be a fall in pitch where t<br/>is a rise?</p><p>&gt;w-h=1<br/>&gt;------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;Es<br/>&gt;Is<br/>&gt;Is<br/>&gt;24<br/>&gt;31<br/>&gt;38<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Okay, we now have the series 24+7n up to 1200.  I don&apos;t need these all<br/>written out: I&apos;ve got a spreadsheet.  Presumably, w-h=m will be the pattern<br/>3m+7n for 3+4 scales?  The difference is that you leave out the first few.</p><p>Please try to think down to my level.  If we can get speaking the same<br/>language, maybe we&apos;ll be able to communicate something!</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
