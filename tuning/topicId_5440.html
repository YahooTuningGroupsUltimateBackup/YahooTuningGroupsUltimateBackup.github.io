I am seeking a similar solution although in a way that will work<br/>with my synth, rather than solely through midi. Here&apos;s what Drew wrote to me:</p><p>At 11:36 AM 10/13/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a> (John Link)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am looking for a notation program that uses standard notation but<br/>&gt;would let me specify the pitch of each note.

But CM is NOT a synthesis program. It is a built for composition,<br/>   is OMS savvy &amp; well suited to MIDI use.</p><p>   This may be the easiest (&amp; a more rewarding) way to work with<br/>   microtonality, especially when dealing with tunings with<br/>   more than 12 notes. Personally I&apos;m trying to break away from the<br/>   conventional linear approach to composing music, mainly inspired by<br/>   playing with the SuperCollider demo ( &amp; glorious lack of formal training<br/>   !:-)</p><p>3) Use a sequencer that allows u to create &quot;note name&quot; lists, such as the<br/>   kind that shows up for percussion tracks, with the name of ea. instrument<br/>   beside the appropriate MIDI note no. So u can make a note name lis<br/>   featuring anything u need.</p><p>   Try : MidiGraphy (Mac)<br/>   <a href="http://ux01.so-net.ne.jp/~mmaeda/indexe.html">http://ux01.so-net.ne.jp/~mmaeda/indexe.html</a></p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interesting reading can be found here :<br/><a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/j.ingram/index.htm">http://home.t-online.de/home/j.ingram/index.htm</a></p><p>The home page of James Ingram, the chap who does work for Stockhausen.<br/>See his info about his work for the big S. &amp; The Notation of Time<br/>(Essay, 1985)</p><p>&gt;&gt;You do not need web access to participate.
