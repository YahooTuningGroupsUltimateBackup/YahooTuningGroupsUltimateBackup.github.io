So perhaps if I get rid of all<br/>speculation and just try to communicate what I have realized, maybe I<br/>can drag some of you onto a similar wavelength (or alternatively,<br/>perhaps I&apos;m nuts. wouldn&apos;t be the first time.).</p><p>I don&apos;t think that anyone would argue that extreme discordance is<br/>unpleasant. But just to remind yourself, go into scala or whatever<br/>program you want, start with the harmonic series, and set up the most<br/>obnoxious sonority possible. Something that just hurts to listen to<br/>and is painful and makes you really just want to shut it off.<br/>Roughness is okay, but see how much damage you can do without it<br/>(throw it in for special effect if you want).</p><p>Now ask yourself, as you&apos;re listening to this spectacular torture<br/>device of your own construction, is there anything specific about the<br/>laws of the universe that should really make it sound so unpleasant?<br/>It&apos;s just a bunch of harmonic series aligned in an inharmonic pattern.</p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s just that the brain responds to a lack of concordance<br/>this way? If so, why are we not grabbing our ears and howling in pain<br/>when we&apos;re in a crowd of people and everyone&apos;s voices happen to not<br/>end up in a bunch of nice pretty JI relationships? Why are we not<br/>grabbing at our ears and howling whenever an air conditioner is turned<br/>on, or white noise is played? Why is it that although this signal is<br/>far below the 130 dB physical threshold of pain, it&apos;s so damned<br/>painful? If you replaced this sound with the sound of a single sine<br/>wave at middle C that&apos;s 3 dB louder, which would be more annoying?<br/>(There&apos;s a listening test for you.)</p><p>The answer seems to be, to me, that this is just another<br/>psychoacoustic mechanism in the brain at work, and one that I believe<br/>is of nearly-equal importance with the periodicity mechanism. We can<br/>all speculate as to why it evolved. Perhaps it&apos;s just a response that<br/>emerges when a tone is constructed with spectral characteristics that<br/>it interfere with the rest of scene analysis. It&apos;s like virtual<br/>nociception.</p><p>Either way, assuming that everyone is in agreement that yes, the<br/>presence of dissonance causes pain in a way that the absence of<br/>consonance does not, then I&apos;ll just note that the rabbit hole here<br/>runs particularly deep. What happens when this stimulus is removed -<br/>does your heart rate drop a little bit and go back to normal? If it<br/>was increased in the first place, does that indicate catecholamines<br/>were released when this sound was played? Perhaps levels of cortisol<br/>went up?</p><p>Or for a shameless conjecture, perhaps the mechanism, like everything<br/>else in the brain involving what clearly seems to be some kind of<br/>stress response, is subject to in vivo adaptations and this response<br/>can change as the organism learns that a more pleasurable stimulus is<br/>likely to follow (classical conditioning; &quot;musical consonance&quot;). Hence<br/>when you listen to the Rite of Spring once it just sounds awfully<br/>chaotic and terrifying, and after a few listens and once the<br/>downregulation has taken place it sounds much more coherent, and once<br/>you&apos;ve listened to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds a million times in a<br/>row it just doesn&apos;t make you feel anything anymore (barring something<br/>else that might override this, like certain musician recreational<br/>habits). Or maybe you come to associate certain chords with personal<br/>symbolic ideas, and the classical conditioning takes place that way -<br/>hence one may not ever truly be able to predict if a chord will cause<br/>&quot;sadness&quot; with 100% certainty. Hence Cameron Bobro&apos;s insight.</p><p>Back to reality - either way, this is something I have long sought to<br/>find: a concrete way that music can cause feelings. Well, here is the<br/>first such concrete example I can think of: pseudo-noxious aural<br/>stimuli can cause a stress response, which has to mean you&apos;re seeing<br/>sympathetic nervous system activation in some form, and which suggests<br/>that something similar to a release of epinephrine and/or cortisol is<br/>taking place.

Minor was not accepted, they thought it will make people sad.  For Hitler even neoclassical Hindemith was too avantguard and fell into the cathegory &quot;entartete Art&quot; (= perverse art)... And Zhdanov in Russia for sure was guilty for destroying Prokofiev and mentally torturing Shostakovitch and many others... Just few days ago I found in one of my scorebooks Shostakovitch&apos;s mass song composed in the beginning of 50ies. Poor guy, but at least he managed to smuggle there an interesting modulation and one simple melodic imitation between voice and piano accompaniment... Oh, such complexity must have been shocking for authorities, but probably it was accepted when it was published. For sure he was terribly unhappy to write such crap for working classes...</p><p>And such things like quartertone music, dodecaphony, later aleatorics, timbre music, electronic music etc. were strictly prohibited as bourgeois western capitalistic dekadence. (That&apos;s the reason why Haba and his quartertone class were expelled from Prague conservatory after communistic cup in 1948 in Czechoslovakia.) There was little bit more freedom during 60ies until 1968 and Warsaw pact armies occupation, but again since 1970 cultural purges started and unable carrieristic characters were supported and could control from their high positions suppression of much clever composers (and other artists).</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2010 10:49:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; There are more notes in the sound of a crowd<br/>&gt; &gt; speaking than in any chord we can come up with, and it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; &gt; like it&apos;s &quot;stabbing a pencil into my ear&quot; or anything like that (the<br/>&gt; &gt; previous description being given to the 13-tet &quot;fifth&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try a diad with 466 cents.

Let us please not lose ourselves in a tangent about the validity of approximation.</p><p>Mike&apos;s theory has nothing to do with the dichotomy of otonality/utonality, nothing to do with approximations, and everything to do with auditory pain.  Cameron&apos;s objection to the the theory rests in the fact that 400 cents is more painful than a pure 5/4, and yet it is not considered minor.  He also seems to be suggesting that 300 cents, which is probably indistinguishable from a pure 19/16, is less painful than 400 cents, and yet is still considered minor.</p><p>The strongest objection to Mike&apos;s hypothesis right now is the fact that the concept of &quot;pain&quot; is not defined in a rigorous or quantifiable way.  Mike is not relating it to rootedness, otonality (though he seems to be defining the harmonic series as the &quot;minimum&quot; of painfulness&quot;), periodicity, or beat-frequency, making it thus unrelated to concepts of discordance/concordance.  Presumably, the concept of pain would be quantified according to something like &quot;average elevation in markers of stress response&quot; brought about by hearing various intervals.  I say this because the way Mike talks about &quot;pain&quot;, it seems to be a psychological concept, NOT a psychoacoustic one.</p><p>If this is, in fact, the case that this is what Mike is suggesting, then I think this hypothesis will fail to accurately predict minorness.  There are a variety of auditory mechanisms that can raise stress response (including volume, discordance, and musical context).  Simply knowing that one sound produces a stronger stress response (&quot;pain sensation&quot;) than another will not be able to tell us that that sound is perceived as &quot;minor&quot;.

The point is that white<br/>noise, or something like crowd noise, is more discordant than most<br/>other sounds you can come up with from an entropy standpoint, but for<br/>you to come up with a more &quot;dissonant&quot; sound, or more irritating one,<br/>would be a trivial exercise in Scala.</p><p>So the point is that there is nothing fundamental about the universe<br/>that makes dissonant sounds actually cause pain. They are just<br/>unpleasant and cause some kind of stress response. So the point is<br/>that there is clearly some kind of &quot;discordance&quot; mechanism in the<br/>brain, as is there a &quot;concordance mechanism&quot; - except that the<br/>discordance one sends a powerful aversion signal for you to remove the<br/>dissonant stimulus from your environment. The most discordant sounds<br/>seem to be the ones in which they aren&apos;t so inharmonic that the brain<br/>perceives them as noise, but they are just inharmonic enough that the<br/>brain can&apos;t figure out if it&apos;s a tonal signal, or multiple tonal<br/>signals, or noise, and hence the whole thing makes auditory processing<br/>difficult to continue.</p><p>So the way to rigorously quantify all of this is for me to find the<br/>spectral characteristics that cause a sound to be maximally<br/>discordant, as a counterpart to the spectral characteristics that<br/>cause a sound to be maximally concordant - alignment with a harmonic<br/>series, high frequency rolloff, etc.</p><p>I have given up even using the phrase &quot;predicting minorness&quot; at this<br/>point, because I think it&apos;s just too loosely defined to be meaningful.<br/>Obviously there are a million things that fit into your schema for<br/>&quot;minor.&quot; The point is now more of an investigation into what makes<br/>minor sound the way it does, and my hypothesis is that part of it<br/>activates this discordance mechanism slightly, and the other chords in<br/>the series of negativity activate it more.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2010 4:21:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, Sep 24, 2010 at 10:50 AM, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, wouldn&apos;t you say that &quot;clearly an approximation&quot; isn&apos;t that right way to put it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And 5/4 and 400 cents both produce a fundamental about two octaves<br/>&gt; down if you play them simultaneously.

Should that happen, l&apos;ll<br/>leave it up to the neurologists to figure out why that kind of<br/>discordance has a musical effect, but other types of discordance<br/>don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Mike, I know you agree that supermajor chords are both painful and major. If painfulness is related to minorness, how can there be painless minor chords and painful major chords? You just keep ignoring this objection, and I don&apos;t know why.</p><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t mean to ignore anything, it&apos;s just that I haven&apos;t had<br/>as much time to respond as carefully as when I was in the states. My<br/>view is that &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;major&quot; are two concepts that we all hold<br/>that really share a number of qualities. For example, for major you<br/>might have</p><p>1) Sounds &quot;happy&quot; for some reason (perhaps by remembering the diatonic scale)<br/>2) It&apos;s rooted, so doesn&apos;t sound like it&apos;s in some kind of inversion<br/>3) Some intuitive knowledge that the third is reachable by four<br/>fifths, or reachable in some other way if you&apos;re familiar with a lot<br/>of xenharmonic systems<br/>4) Perhaps if you&apos;re used to 12-tet, the canonical major third for you<br/>will be a little bit sharp and nervous or excited sounding<br/>5) Part of the major scale and other scales you might know</p><p>All of those are &quot;major.&quot; Those are all separate qualities that<br/>converge on this entity that we call &quot;the major chord.&quot; Now, if we<br/>want to find other chords that have the same quality, we&apos;d have to<br/>pick one or a set of those and find a set of different chords sharing<br/>those. And at that point, someone could always say &quot;Yes, but those<br/>chords aren&apos;t MAJOR, because they don&apos;t have (insert the other quality<br/>from the list that these new chords lack).&quot; And sometimes we<br/>substitute the mood of the chord for its name - like during that<br/>phrygian dominant middle eastern example I posted a while here ago.<br/>Carl heard the root as &quot;happy,&quot; I heard it taking on more of a<br/>&quot;mystical&quot; quality. The point is that it was still a major chord.</p><p>Now let&apos;s look at minor. Here are some minor chord qualities</p><p>1) Sounds &quot;sad&quot; for some reason<br/>2) It still sounds rooted and not in inversion, but can also sound<br/>rooted in first inversion too in a different way<br/>3) Some intuitive knowledge that the third is reachable by three<br/>fourths, or some other magical way you might have learned<br/>4) We might be aware that it is, apparently, a &quot;utonal&quot; chord<br/>5) Part of the minor scale and other scales you might know.</p><p>So here&apos;s a question then, Igs. You play minor thirds all the time<br/>when you play the blues, but they take on a totally different meaning,<br/>and feeling, and context. Do they still count as &quot;minor thirds?&quot; Or<br/>are they something else now, like a #9 or a blue note?</p><p>Anyway, point is, the only thing that fits -all- of the different<br/>qualities we&apos;ve attributed to the minor chord is the minor chord. I<br/>hear everything in the &quot;series of negativity&quot; example as just a minor<br/>chord with different extensions on top of it. However, I asked myself<br/>- what makes the minor chord sound so sad? - and the answer I&apos;m now<br/>exploring is that it causes some kind of aversive response to fire<br/>very slightly. It seems perfectly plausible to me and I&apos;m well aware<br/>it&apos;s just a hypothesis, but you have to use some kind of heuristic for<br/>plausibility if you&apos;re ever going to spend time investigating anything<br/>at all.</p><p>So your objection, that supermajor chords can sound sad and/or<br/>irritating, but they&apos;re still major isn&apos;t anything I haven&apos;t addressed<br/>- I used supermajor chords to create the three &quot;equivalent sadness&quot;<br/>chords at the end of the listening example I posted. They do sound<br/>&quot;major&quot; in the sense that you know it could sort of fit into the<br/>&quot;major&quot; box into your brain too. They also do sound irritating and/or<br/>painful and, if you do them right, might even take on a bit of a &quot;sad&quot;<br/>quality too (and I -know- I&apos;m not the first person on here to say<br/>that). I do believe I&apos;ve even heard Cameron say that various<br/>supermajor thirds sound &quot;minor&quot; in that regard.</p><p>So the point is that even discordant chords that would otherwise sound<br/>&quot;major&quot; can cause that aversive response to fire slightly. I don&apos;t<br/>think (or care either way really) that we should start calling<br/>supermajor chords &quot;minor.&quot; It&apos;s just important to me to find out WHY<br/>minor sounds the way it does, and find other chords that might sound<br/>similar.</p><p>The point is that if we want to come up with some generalized version<br/>of minor, we have to take some subset of the qualities that it has and<br/>find other chords that have that too. And no matter what you come up<br/>with, someone can say &quot;well, these don&apos;t sound &apos;minor&apos; because they<br/>lack other quality &apos;z&apos;.&quot; Quality z might have led to a different set<br/>of chords, and the only chord that meets every single one of the<br/>qualities that some person has might just be the 5-limit minor triad.</p><p>So I am simply looking to explore what makes minor chords sound the<br/>way they do (sad or whatever word you want to use), and find other<br/>chords that may produce similar feelings, even if for other reasons we<br/>wouldn&apos;t use the word &quot;minor&quot; for them. Note again that we don&apos;t<br/>really think of the minor third in the blues as being minor in the<br/>same sense that a minor third would take in some classical fugue in<br/>minor. (what?)</p><p>Of course, I didn&apos;t want to type all of that originally, so I just<br/>said &quot;these chords kind of sound sad like minor,&quot; not expecting that<br/>everyone would then say &quot;yes but they don&apos;t share this other quality<br/>that the minor chord also has,&quot; etc.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2010 12:40:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cameron wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yep, 14:11 is also in the 5:4 field of attraction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Read my previous post to Mike.</p><p>My eyes are still burning from it.</p><p>&gt; The &quot;field of attraction&quot; is scalar, Carl.</p><p>Wrong, Cameron.</p><p>&gt; 5:4 is NOT responsible for what we call &quot;major&quot;.</p><p>No disagreement here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have no doubt people can learn to recognize middle thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; as distinct, functional intervals.

The terms &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; are being grossly abused in this discussion.  A major 7th is not happy, and a minor 6th is an inversion of a major 3rd (for instance); everyone in this discussion has become hung up on &quot;major and minor thirds&quot; and completely forgotten that there are a host of other major/minor intervals, all of which have different emotional qualities.  If we were talking about the decatonic scale in Pajara, we&apos;d have a variety of other major/minor interval classes with different psychoacoustic identities associated with them.  Could we possibly expect any generalization about majorness or minorness to hold up if we classed intervals differently?  NO!  All the terms &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; are good for is in differentiating two sizes of interval within an interval class.  We over-simplify and over-extend them to refer to various ratios.  And even in 12-tET, there is no one thing all major intervals have in common with each other (other than that they are the wider of two intervals in their respective classes).</p><p>&gt;  However, I asked myself<br/>&gt; - what makes the minor chord sound so sad? - and the answer I&apos;m now<br/>&gt; exploring is that it causes some kind of aversive response to fire<br/>&gt; very slightly.

Mike, I don&apos;t mean to be a jerk, but how can you reduce an emotion like &quot;sadness&quot; to simply a quantity of &quot;aversion response&quot;?  An aversive response comes with so many different emotions--anger, fear, disgust, contempt, etc.--so it&apos;s ludicrous to think that you can describe any one emotion as simply a quantity of aversive response.  These emotions can all be associated with pain, but the quality of pain is SO DIFFERENT from one emotion to the next that if all you&apos;re looking at is *quantity* of pain, you&apos;re missing out on the important stuff.</p><p>&gt; So I am simply looking to explore what makes minor chords sound the<br/>&gt; way they do (sad or whatever word you want to use), and find other<br/>&gt; chords that may produce similar feelings, even if for other reasons we<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t use the word &quot;minor&quot; for them. Note again that we don&apos;t<br/>&gt; really think of the minor third in the blues as being minor in the<br/>&gt; same sense that a minor third would take in some classical fugue in<br/>&gt; minor. (what?)</p><p>Okay, so now you seem to be defeating your own argument from another perspective, saying that the quality is not in the interval itself but in the context.  The minor third in blues does not come from any different sort of &quot;detuning&quot; a harmonic series, nor does it cause any more or less psychoacoustic &quot;pain&quot;.  No offense, man, but I really think you&apos;ve pulled a Wile E. Coyote move and are standing on thin air with this theory.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2010 11:45:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 9/26/10, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree with every single one of these.</p><p>*head bang on table*</p><p>&gt; Wait, really?

My<br/>&gt; view is that &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;major&quot; are two concepts that we all hold<br/>&gt; that really share a number of qualities. For example, for major you<br/>&gt; might have<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Sounds &quot;happy&quot; for some reason (perhaps by remembering the diatonic scale).</p><p>I remember a friend of mine, fantastically talented musician, coming home from school just tripping about having heard his first demonstration that the generalization that major=happy isn&apos;t true. IIRC, late Scubert is the classic example and I think that&apos;s what the professor used to illustrate the point. The other traditional counterexample to this are the Frelikhs of klezmer- &quot;joyful tunes&quot;,  &quot;minor&quot; as all get out.</p><p>I apologize for the bilious nature of my responses. But you should understand that what pushes my red button is not irrational or historically unrooted.</p><p>Daniel Forro understood the source of my ire- he lived through it. Everyone doing truly &quot;alternative&quot; music is eventually going to experience this to some degree. Having heard all my life first-hand accounts of where ham-fisted attitudes about music and the arts (and everything else) can lead (my dad is an esapee from Stalin), I&apos;m alert to them. As every thoughtful artist should be regardless of their background.</p><p>So, I think that right off the bat it&apos;s a good idea to heavily qualify<br/>the happy/sad nature of major/minor. Ignoring these associations altogether would be ahistorical soggy-minded relativism which leads to a mental power-vaccuum into which the most heavily armed will surely step, though. It&apos;s a complex thing, tread with care.</p><p>&gt; 2) It&apos;s rooted, so doesn&apos;t sound like it&apos;s in some kind of inversion</p><p>Once again, the example of 9:7. I can hear this as a kind of &quot;major 3rd&quot; in context, but the diad is pretty strongly rooted on the 9/7, ie. it sounds like some kind of inversion.</p><p>And I think you guys should pay attention to Chris Vasail&apos;s point. There&apos;s a big range within 3:2 into which we can stick all kinds of intervals and it&apos;s going to work as a &quot;rooted triad&quot;.</p><p>The &quot;noble mediant&quot; &quot;thirds&quot; are particularly interesting. Within a 3:2, both 282 cents and 423 cents are, to my ears, very concretely rooted on the &quot;C&quot;. The reason for this, I believe, is that these intervals are very fuzzy in terms of the harmonic series. Their lack of resolution leaves the stark rootedness of the 3:2 very, er, dominant. So much for any concrete or simple &quot;field of attraction&quot; of simple intervals, for I hear (as Terhardt predicts BTW) the strongest virtual pitch root of a triad with 6:5 in a &quot;sixth&quot; relation to the triad, that is, the strongest &quot;root&quot; of A-C-E as F. Less so in 12-tET.</p><p>&gt; 3) Some intuitive knowledge that the third is reachable by four<br/>&gt; fifths, or reachable in some other way if you&apos;re familiar with a lot<br/>&gt; of xenharmonic systems</p><p>Scanned according to accustomed position in modal context. I said earlier that this is reasonable (so much for your bizarre idea that I just say the opposite of what you say, Mike. :-P )</p><p>&gt; 4) Perhaps if you&apos;re used to 12-tet, the canonical major third for &gt;you<br/>&gt; will be a little bit sharp and nervous or excited sounding</p><p>Used to Pythagorean tuning would be a better way of putting it.</p><p>This brings up a major, hehe, problem with &quot;aversion&quot; hypotheses. As I have mentioned several times already, there is also aversion to beatlessness. Kyle Gann has mentioned this, I encounter it occaisionally.</p><p>&gt; 5) Part of the major scale and other scales you might know<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of those are &quot;major.&quot; Those are all separate qualities that<br/>&gt; converge on this entity that we call &quot;the major chord.&quot; Now, if we<br/>&gt; want to find other chords that have the same quality, we&apos;d have to<br/>&gt; pick one or a set of those and find a set of different chords sharing<br/>&gt; those. And at that point, someone could always say &quot;Yes, but those<br/>&gt; chords aren&apos;t MAJOR, because they don&apos;t have (insert the other quality<br/>&gt; from the list that these new chords lack).&quot; And sometimes we<br/>&gt; substitute the mood of the chord for its name - like during that<br/>&gt; phrygian dominant middle eastern example I posted a while here ago.<br/>&gt; Carl heard the root as &quot;happy,&quot; I heard it taking on more of a<br/>&gt; &quot;mystical&quot; quality. The point is that it was still a major chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s look at minor. Here are some minor chord qualities<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Sounds &quot;sad&quot; for some reason</p><p>Sounds deeply joyful for some reason. Whoops, you have to just write me off in order support a strong dichotomy here.</p><p>&gt; 2) It still sounds rooted and not in inversion, but can also sound<br/>&gt; rooted in first inversion too in a different way</p><p>A-C-E generally sounds most rooted on F to me and apparently others- but any interval within a broad range can be taken as the middle tone of a triad which still retains its traditional &quot;root&quot;. So I don&apos;t see anything wrong with this observation.</p><p>&gt; 3) Some intuitive knowledge that the third is reachable by three<br/>&gt; fourths, or some other magical way you might have learned</p><p>I&apos;m cool with this, see above in the &quot;major&quot; section.</p><p>&gt; 4) We might be aware that it is, apparently, a &quot;utonal&quot; chord</p><p>But the 12-tET minor triad can fairly reasonably be described as Otonal. So I doubt that this one flies. You could argue that the 12-tET m3 lies within the field of attraction of 6:5 and therefore has the Utonal quality, but those who would do so would surely insist that 282 cents also lies within the field of attraction of 6:5, and 282 cents behaves in an Otonal manner.</p><p>&gt; quality too (and I -know- I&apos;m not the first person on here to say<br/>&gt; that). I do believe I&apos;ve even heard Cameron say that various<br/>&gt; supermajor thirds sound &quot;minor&quot; in that regard.</p><p>Yes, I find that they can have that kind calmness/sweetness/joy. But it&apos;s highly contextual, for in practice supermajor thirds can be real bullies as far as implied motion. If you&apos;re looking for harmonic series explanations, I should mention that I find these positive qualities in supermajor thirds in jangly timbres and in chalmeau (odd partial) timbres, and not, to my memory, in most timbres.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, I didn&apos;t want to type all of that originally, so I just<br/>&gt; said &quot;these chords kind of sound sad like minor,&quot; not expecting that<br/>&gt; everyone would then say &quot;yes but they don&apos;t share this other quality<br/>&gt; that the minor chord also has,&quot; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>The reason why people say &quot;yes but they don&apos;t share this other quality<br/>&gt; that the minor chord also has&quot; is to point out that you can&apos;t claim that quality is what makes something sound &quot;minor&quot;.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2010 2:33:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If you&apos;re going to use Partch as your Authority on psychoacoustics, you might as well go ahead and affix the big round red nose and hydroballistic corsage.</p><p>But I should use different terminology.</p><p>I&apos;ll say rather that we have windows of (sub)harmonic identity, and windows of scalar/modal identity, and that these windows are flexible and interact with other.</p><p>&gt; Your poor attitude is doing nothing to help your understanding<br/>&gt; of these matters.</p><p>Within hours of your first step toward actually understanding what you&apos;re talking about, you&apos;ll be busting out with great big piles of good music.

Then again, we seem to have lost sight of this on this<br/>&gt; list: the idea of making things typical musicians can actually use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    It seems anyone who dares to present an opinion on this list and<br/>&gt; say more than &quot;I agree, I disagree&quot; on this list is bound to be<br/>&gt; accused of &quot;psuedo-science&quot; or &quot;mucking up the list with too many<br/>&gt; comments&quot; or &quot;going off topic&quot; or even being &quot;a pure useless idiot&quot;<br/>&gt; by at least one and likely several members (or, in my case, even<br/>&gt; being asked to &quot;honestly&quot;, for example, &quot;admit&quot; to holding a<br/>&gt; &quot;completely unresearch&quot; view when I spent the last month or more<br/>&gt; studying it and gave specific, if not &quot;perfect&quot;, examples?!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    This is NOT quality control, this is chaos!

I would add 11/9, 18/11, 22/15, 13/9 and a<br/>&gt; handful of other intervals as having &quot;windows of recognition&quot;...acknowledging<br/>&gt; that those windows are much more narrow but often also much steeper.<br/>&gt;    This all goes back to my original question why are 6/5, 5/4, &gt;4/3, 3/2,<br/>&gt; 7/4....considered low entropy while things like 11/9 are &gt;not...explained in pure<br/>&gt; mathematical equations?  If I had the exact equations rather than &gt;abstract<br/>&gt; mumbo-jumbo about what HE means without explaining why it works...I (and maybe<br/>&gt; we) could perhaps find a fundamental point in the formula that &gt;could be improved<br/>&gt; and close correlate with what we actually hear.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you read older literature- and get access to JSTOR, man!- you&apos;ll find there&apos;s been a continuous and persistent presence in muscial theory which will go to any lengths to &quot;prove&quot; that western tonal diatonic major/minor is &quot;the&quot; &quot;natural&quot; state of affairs, and anything deviating from that is artificial in some way.

He also notes that the sense of root would change if all chords were<br/>forced to be pure...but does not seem to note that the chance in general would<br/>be incredibly slight (IE the same kind of effect Adaptive JI has on slight<br/>&apos;commatic shifts&apos;, for example...despite that listening tests on this list,<br/>among other places, seem to say people still OFTEN prefer that type of error to<br/>the errors of 12TET).   He also says higher TET scales like 53 are just &quot;scales<br/>full of commas&quot;, but never seems to specify exactly what those commas are<br/>relative to (IE meantone, 12TET, pythagorean?)</p><p>      He also makes one huge error IMVHO...saying JI is only useful for<br/>triads...when obviously you can make a scale out of JI tetrads or larger<br/>chords...or go the other way (as I often do) and forego triads and, via, JI,<br/>concentrate on make all the dyads &quot;pure&quot; (which can be done, at least within 8<br/>cents or so of perfect, unlike making a scale with all possible triads pure).</p><p>     He also brings up an organist &quot;N. Lindsey Norden&quot; and makes a bizarre claim<br/>that no singer can sing in proper &quot;acapella&quot; JI...while Barbershop Quartets and<br/>other types of singer do this regularly.  He also claims tempered intervals are<br/>&quot;fused&quot; by the mind as pure intervals, but provides no example.  He also notes<br/>that singers fluctuate both in pitch/portamento and vibrato around a note, but<br/>listeners do not mind...he uses it as proof of that being &quot;a bit off just<br/>doesn&apos;t matter&quot;...but I would guess it comes down to such fluctuations&apos; being<br/>sudden and short, with most of the emphasis being on far less<br/>vibrating/pitch-modulating tones that are held much longer.  He seems to note<br/>the errors of JI in playing enharmonic equivalents, but appears to go off on a<br/>limb and say Pythagorean based meantone tuning is the ultimate because it<br/>handles enharmonic equivalents and usage so well for &quot;historical&quot; music.  Dare I<br/>say it, even his reasoning beyond why JI is bad at enharmonic equivalents seems<br/>wrong IE several 12TET tones get &quot;blurred&quot; between enharmonic equivalents as<br/>well.</p><p>      His main fault seems to be he rates JI for how much it approaches<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; common practice usage and properties exclusive to TET scales (IE<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; transposition an how intervals are equally distant from any &quot;root<br/>tone&quot;)....but he also bizarrely notes the lack of the popularity of JI<br/>instruments, but uses bizarre examples like Bosanquet&apos;s 83!! notes to the octave<br/>piano...and then complains how they are two complex to play (he seems to assume<br/>all instruments involving approach of JI must both only be TET-based and have a<br/>huge number of notes).

A close scrutiny of qanuns in the Middle East will reveal a<br/>prominence of &quot;11-limit&quot; middle second and middle third approximations<br/>in maqams such as Ushshaq, Hijaz, Saba, Huzzam, etc... in the body of<br/>24-tET and 72-tET as well as my alternative formulations as Michael<br/>pointed out.</p><p>4. While Rauf Yekta &amp; co. have denounced Ancient Greek theory as<br/>having engaged itself in play of numbers and nothing more (implying<br/>the same for Muslim theorists), most scholars of this day and age DO<br/>NOT agree that Islamic Middle Ages music theory have no bearing on<br/>practice. In fact, the existence of middle seconds and middle thirds<br/>in these treatises that are found today in frequency measurements<br/>reveal a truth much warped by nationalistic ideologies of the 20th<br/>Century in the Middle East.</p><p>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Oct 9, 2010, at 10:51 PM, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; Michael wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe you can point me to an example then?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; From <a href="http://www.chrysalis-foundation.org/Al-Farabi%27s_%27Uds.htm">http://www.chrysalis-foundation.org/Al-Farabi%27s_%27Uds.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought you said you&apos;d heard musical examples, so that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what I was looking for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This mirrors what I read in Ozan Yarman&apos;s thesis...that the<br/>&gt;&gt; tempered quarter tone (IE in 24TET) is, in fact, a gross<br/>&gt;&gt; oversimplification of what actually happens in Persian music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Recent analysis of one Libyan ud performance revealed it to<br/>&gt; conform almost exactly to 24-ET.  Actually the quartertone<br/>&gt; intervals are given much less airtime than the others, so in<br/>&gt; fact it conforms very closely to 12-ET and/or Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning if you prefer.  Of course the pitch is all over the<br/>&gt; place, and this is used creatively by the artists in a way<br/>&gt; that no scale of fixed pitches fully captures.  The claim you<br/>&gt; are quoting from al-Farabi and/or Forster, that musicians<br/>&gt; reliably distinguish between 350 cents and 27/22, is patently<br/>&gt; wrong.  Most of the instruments used in maqam music have<br/>&gt; tuning accuracy of at best 5 cents, with the possible<br/>&gt; exception of the qanun.  There&apos;s no evidence for 11-prime-<br/>&gt; limit ratios on qanun&apos;s anywhere, unless you happen to be<br/>&gt; at Ozan&apos;s house. :)  Most scholars agree that al-Farabi,<br/>&gt; like Ptolemy and other theorists of antiquity, were engaged<br/>&gt; in creative number games that did not accurately model the<br/>&gt; performances of the day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As far as Akkoc et al, you can read my recent remarks on<br/>&gt; their most recent paper here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/90119?var=0&l=1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/90119?var=0&l=1</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2010 10:33:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Let the corrections be made:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

The whole point behind the idea of approximation is that certain tempered intervals can be &quot;heard&quot; as ratios, so to say a tempered interval approximates a ratio, you have to have some evidence to show that the brain is, in fact, interpreting that interval as that ratio.  It&apos;s easy to do this with low-limit intervals like 5/4 or 3/2, because they are of such lower complexity than their near-by neighbors.  11-ratios like 11/8 and 11/9 are not of such drastically lower complexity than their near-by neighbors.  That&apos;s not to say you can&apos;t get close to them when tuning by ear, it&apos;s quite simple to tune to a quarter-tone interval by ear just by feeling for the &quot;halfway point&quot;--but there&apos;s just no justification to say for sure that a specific ratio is being approximated, unless we have a larger framework that treats those intervals unambiguously as approximations.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2010 9:15:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Primarily melodic, strongly stepwise music is what we&apos;re talking about,<br/>Igliashon.

The difference between them is that the field of attraction of the minima arise from the periodicity of the single simple ratio at the core, whereas at the maxima it arises from something else (I&apos;m not sure what, but I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s not periodicity and it&apos;s not tied to a specific ratio).  Regardless, I think the hardest regions of pitch-space to tune reliably are those between minima and maxima of H.E., or in other words, those where the slope of H.E. has a high value.</p><p>At any rate, the obvious periodicity of low-limit intervals is what I think makes them strong attractors, especially because nothing near them is remotely as obviously periodic.  But there is definitely another mechanism at work that makes intervals at H.E. maxima &quot;stand out&quot; on the pitch-spectrum.  But this is why I don&apos;t like using ratios: they give the illusion of discrete identities, when in fact, the identity is more tied just to a region of pitch-space than it is to anything as exact as a frequency ratio.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2010 10:50:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; But Michael, some of your favorite ratios are well above the<br/>&gt; 15-limit.  22/15 is 21-limit, 50/33 is 49-limit, etc.</p><p>You&apos;ll probably kick yourself, but 22/15 is 15-limit, and<br/>50/33 is 33-limit.*</p><p>* More accurately, they are &quot;ratios of&quot; 15 and 33, respectively.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2010 1:01:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 15 October 2010 20:15, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The burden of proof lies on those who would claim that this is NOT so.<br/>&gt; Take for instance, Carl&apos;s descriptions of maqam tunes as being in 24-tET<br/>&gt; with tiny variations/expressive intonation.

It can&apos;t be any shock that there is 24-tET maqam music, as the tuning has been taught in different regions for decades now: kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>But in my experience there&apos;s too much music consistently different from 24-tET. That maqam mansuri you linked to? That&apos;s not 24-tET. The graphic representation shows pitches close to 24-tET, but so what? It simply doesn&apos;t sound like 24-tET, tune it up for yourself and try it out.</p><p>When I was in Istanbul, I heard a Turkish third step of just-shy-of-5/4 many times. It&apos;s... characteristic. That interval simply doesn&apos;t exist in 24-tET. And the guys playing it will be more than happy to explain to you that it&apos;s a commatic alteration. 53-tET is alive and well (even if it&apos;s called &quot;commas&quot;), just go to the street of music shops in Bayoglu and hang out for some days like I did, and find out for yourself. Neither does 7/6 occur in 24-tET, yet it&apos;s a signature sound in maqam musics; my six-year-old recognizes it as &quot;desert-ly&quot; or &quot;really Egyptian&quot; for crying out loud.</p><p>Now, you could make a case for 48-tET and it would be much more difficult to argue with. But it still can&apos;t compete with a most ancient description, which happens to be that favored by Occam&apos;s razor as well: Pythagorean framework, local/stylistic/expressive divisions within, with those divisions favoring the acoustically more resonant (simple and superparticualr ratios).</p><p>Ancient. Bonehead simple. Not imported from the West. Tunable by ear.</p><p>So for an &quot;about 150 cents interval&quot;, for example, instead of dicking around with 24 and approximate cents you can just go up a Pythagorean ditone, down a 6/7 and whoops there you have an &quot;about 150 cents&quot; step that actually sounds &quot;desert-like&quot;. And what do you know, you didn&apos;t need a machine to tune it, and it has NOTHING to do with numerology: in my sons terms and dropping octaves, you could just go up &quot;soldierly&quot; four times and down &quot;desert-ly&quot; once and there you are. Final result indistinguishable from 13/12 by the way, but numbers are just names, it&apos;s the sounds that are real.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Graham,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl&apos;s claim is that as far as there&apos;s any pattern to the pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; distribution, it&apos;s consistent with 24-tET.

And sounds in real life are sounds in contexts. So don&apos;t worry about &quot;complexity&quot;- maybe something just has a complex &quot;name&quot; (number). Or maybe it&apos;s &quot;complex&quot; naked and alone, but in context very simple.</p><p>In my relentless pursuit of truth in sound, regardless of number, the other day I sang &quot;low tritones&quot; over a drone. You just solfege it and settle on  where it blends together or otherwise sounds best to you in some consistent way. I sang consistently 11/8&apos;s (within a couple of cents). They&apos;re very &quot;blended&quot;. My attempts at 7/5 are flat, and doing the analysis later I could hear and measure it drooping... pulled by 11:8. That is, apparently, a &quot;natural low tritone&quot; for me, whereas 7/5 just doesn&apos;t have that drive to blend in- for me.</p><p>But when I do clarinet over clarinet (multitrack), the n/7 and 7/n intervals are easy to find, incredibly strong and audibly Just, whereas an 11/8 tritone and ratios of 11 in general do not have much of a concrete presence at all.</p><p>(By the way you have to ear in the tones in a wind instrument, especially with the funky fingerings needed for microtones. Fingering just puts you within about, I don&apos;t know, it varies, a 50+ cent range and you have to use your ear and embouchure from there. In fact I sometimes use the same fingerings for tones up to 70 cents apart, because there are fewer options in some places, like right around the register key.)</p><p>Does 13:8 exert a &quot;gravity&quot;? I&apos;ve found, trying lower middle 6ths, that it&apos;s too hard for me NOT to hit 13:8, within 5 cents, even if I&apos;m deliberately trying for something else! So there&apos;s definitely a pull of gravity there. Not on my erhu, though- it sings at ratios of 11. 11:6 is really easy to find, and sounds very smooth and natural- but the instrument has an unusually strong 11th and 6th partials so  the simplest explanation for this might lie there.</p><p>Anyway- trust your ears.

And yes, I understand that this means the interval is really 350+/- maybe 8 or 10 cents, but since ratios suggest a relationship to the harmonic series and cents don&apos;t, I think it&apos;s better to use cents for intervals that don&apos;t produce clear harmonic-series relationships.</p><p>On the other hand, I do agree that as a bench-mark for measurement or performance, ratios might be simpler to conceive and easier to deal with than cents.  Not if what you desire is a perfectly-equal temperament, of course, but if pitch discretion is not of tantamount importance and/or if you are playing music with very small or no vertical structures (where exact intonation is not necessary), and/or if you are playing in Just Intonation, then yeah, ratios are what you want for performance and instrument design.  It&apos;s the idea that they are useful for describing a perceptual identity that I (and I believe Carl as well) disagree with.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2010 9:31:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Igs:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing, that&apos;s the point: ratios = dyads.

Ratios are used to describe melodic &quot;horizontal&quot; movement as &gt; well. And a strict line between horizontal &gt;and vertical doesn&apos;t exist in phyical reality,<br/>&gt; &gt; anyway. Unless you were to write music with, say, sine tones playing a monophonic line &gt; with long pauses between each note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What part of &quot;not necessarily sounded simultaneously&quot; failed to &gt;register?  I never said they were inherently vertical, but a ratio &gt;is a relationship between two notes.  Obviously, an arpeggiated &gt;chord is still a chord.  But if you&apos;re going to say a note is a 3/2, &gt;it&apos;s only a 3/2 in relationship to another note.  Two notes = a &gt;dyad.</p><p>The general term is simply &quot;interval&quot;. &quot;Dyad&quot; when used in tonal music refers a vertical sonority. It&apos;s &quot;set theory&quot; that uses &quot;dyad&quot; for two tones whether in the vertical and horizontal, but they&apos;re a &quot;dyad&quot; as part of theoretical &quot;set&quot;, not simply two tones. Two tones are distinguished by an &quot;interval&quot;.</p><p>I think it&apos;s important to distinguish.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This sounds sensible at first glance, but I don&apos;t think that it is a good interpretation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; First of all, what happened to the &quot;harmonic series detector in the brain&quot;? (quote from<br/>&gt; &gt; intro to Harmonic Entropy). If the brain does indeed have a harmonic series detector,<br/>&gt; &gt; then ratios are the best &quot;names&quot; for intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not if the ratios are near a maximum of H.E., where the harmonic series detector is basically short-circuited.</p><p>That&apos;s speculation.

It&apos;s &quot;set theory&quot; that uses &quot;dyad&quot; for two tones whether in the vertical and<br/>&gt; horizontal, but they&apos;re a &quot;dyad&quot; as part of theoretical &quot;set&quot;, not simply two tones. Two<br/>&gt; tones are distinguished by an &quot;interval&quot;.</p><p>If by &quot;vertical&quot; you mean &quot;notes sounded simultaneously&quot;, this is just wrong.  As I said before, an arpeggiated chord is still a chord.  You can arpeggiate a triad and still call it a triad, so why can&apos;t you do the same with dyad?  Either way, I think we both know what I meant, and arguing over semantics is just goofy.</p><p>My point was, if you sing a C, and then a G 702 cents up from the C, is the G a 3/2?  It is and isn&apos;t, in a sort of Schr&ouml;dinger way.  It&apos;s a 3/2 in relation to the C, but the C is not sounding, and furthermore, depending on what other notes are in the sequence, that G could be a 6/4, a 15/10, etc. etc.  As you&apos;ve pointed out to me before (on the Xenharmonic Ning, iirc), it&apos;s not always appropriate to reduce ratios to lowest terms!  Or do you rescind that remark?</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s speculation. Personally, I think it is quite reasonable speculation, but that doesn&apos;t &gt; mean it&apos;s &quot;true&quot;, or even that I agree with it.</p><p>Let&apos;s back-track a little, shall we?  You initially argued that one can&apos;t insist on 24-TET and deny the 11-limit.  This is, in essence, a claim that those odd-quarter-tone intervals, like 150 cents and 350 cents, are essentially and unambiguously interpreted by the ear/brain as 11-limit ratios, specifically 12/11 and 11/9 (respectively), apparently even as bare melodic intervals absent any vertical harmony.  But then you agreed that rational intervals have a bit of perceptual &quot;fuzz&quot; around them, maybe of 8-10 cents (or something).  Then when I argued that there are lots of ratios within that fuzz-zone of 150 and 350 cents--which thus makes them high in harmonic entropy--you dismissed harmonic entropy as speculation, but failed to offer any argument as to why those 11-limit intervals you insist on have any perceptual precedence over the other ratios I mentioned which are within the fields of &quot;fuzz&quot; of those quarter-tonal intervals.  So I still don&apos;t see how you can insist on 24-TET being necessarily/essentially 11-limit.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2010 6:34:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;I wonder what the point of starting tuning-research was.

The hardest parts of the pitch-continuum to tune or perceive are the parts of the harmonic entropy graph where the slope is high--the points between minima and maxima.</p><p>Does that make sense yet?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2010 7:50:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I will say, I&apos;ve actually gained a bit of respect for Marcel thanks to the tuning-research list.

That was rather my point...that 8 cents from a<br/>ratio 8 cents below 11/9 makes a lot more tonal difference than 11/9 vs. 8 cents<br/>below 11/9.

But then the worst I figure you could say is &quot;hey<br/>guess what, you missed by 2 cents!&quot; :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not that H.E. has some sort of prejudice against 11-limit intervals. 11/6<br/>&gt;gets a field of attraction (sort of) as does 11/4.&quot;<br/>  True...it includes some 11-limit intervals, but not others.  But Maqam, as I<br/>understand it, has a whole slew full of very near-11-limit intervals while<br/>Harmonic Entropy has only the two or so you just mentioned.  And, maybe an<br/>expert can clarify, but why does HE say those two are better in the first place<br/>(IE why do they have less &quot;entropy&quot;)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;What happens when a bunch of fields of attraction overlap?

The<br/>reason it is important to distinguish here is that if you are interested<br/>in discussing and implementing alternative tuning in new music in the<br/>wider world, it is wise to avoid the eccentric or reactionary position<br/>that Just intonation is defined by vertical structures. It is not. Out<br/>in the real world, Just Intonation means the Just intonation of<br/>something. That something is, intervals, and the Just part means either<br/>beatless, or, tuned according to how it appears in a harmonic series-<br/>&quot;naturally&quot;.  And &quot;dyad&quot; means of something, too- of a &quot;set&quot;, whether an<br/>&quot;atonal&quot; set or of a &quot;tonal&quot; set (chord). &quot;Interval&quot; is neutral- and<br/>correct here.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point was, if you sing a C, and then a G 702 cents up from the C,<br/>is the G a 3/2?  It is and isn&apos;t, in a sort of Schr&ouml;dinger &gt;way.<br/>It&apos;s a 3/2 in relation to the C, but the C is not sounding, and<br/>furthermore, depending on what other notes are in the &gt;sequence, that G<br/>could be a 6/4, a 15/10, etc. etc.  As you&apos;ve pointed out to me before<br/>(on the Xenharmonic Ning, iirc), it&apos;s &gt;not always appropriate to reduce<br/>ratios to lowest terms!  Or do you rescind that remark?</p><p>I agree with what you&apos;re saying here, in that the G has more than one<br/>identity, certainly! and am not rescinding anything. Using the term<br/>&quot;dyad&quot; confuses what you are saying.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s speculation. Personally, I think it is quite reasonable<br/>speculation, but that doesn&apos;t &gt; mean it&apos;s &quot;true&quot;, or even that I &gt;agree<br/>with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s back-track a little, shall we?  You initially argued that one<br/>can&apos;t insist on 24-TET and deny the 11-limit.  This is, in &gt;essence, a<br/>claim that those odd-quarter-tone intervals, like 150 cents and 350<br/>cents, are essentially and unambiguously &gt;interpreted by the ear/brain<br/>as 11-limit ratios, specifically 12/11 and 11/9 (respectively),<br/>apparently even as bare melodic &gt;intervals absent any vertical harmony.<br/>But then you agreed that rational intervals have a bit of perceptual<br/>&quot;fuzz&quot; around &gt;them, maybe of 8-10 cents (or something).  Then when I<br/>argued that there are lots of ratios within that fuzz-zone of 150 and<br/>&gt;350 cents--which thus makes them high in harmonic entropy--you<br/>dismissed harmonic entropy as speculation, but failed to &gt;offer any<br/>argument as to why those 11-limit intervals you insist on have any<br/>perceptual precedence over the other ratios I &gt;mentioned which are<br/>within the fields of &quot;fuzz&quot; of those quarter-tonal intervals.  So I<br/>still don&apos;t see how you can insist on &gt;24-TET being<br/>necessarily/essentially 11-limit.</p><p>That statement was made in the context of talking about &quot;maqam music&quot;. I<br/>assumed, incorrectly, that everyone in the discussion had a basic<br/>understanding of what we&apos;re calling &quot;maqam music&quot;, and maqam tuning.  In<br/>maqam music, there is  enormous evidence of the tendency to stepwise<br/>movement by superparticular interval, and of superparticular and simple<br/>(n+1/n for example) relationships within the basic Pythagorean<br/>structure.  The enormous rational figures that appear in Islamic texts<br/>as a result of Pythagorean &quot;bearing plans&quot; don&apos;t change this- once<br/>you&apos;ve figured out where those intervals lie, you&apos;ll find that you still<br/>have those superparticular and simple intervals. Even if you insist that<br/>the 317 and 384 cent intervals don&apos;t sound like 6/5 and 5/4, the layout<br/>of superparticular and simple intervals within a Pythagorean structure,<br/>whether exact or extremely close, doesn&apos;t change.</p><p>Haven&apos;t you ever noticed how step-wise and sinuous maqam music generally<br/>is? An interval like 27:22 is not complex in that context- it is simply<br/>a step of 12/11 from a step of 9/8.

The<br/>&gt; &gt; reason it is important to distinguish here is that if you are interested<br/>&gt; &gt; in discussing and implementing alternative tuning in new music in the<br/>&gt; &gt; wider world, it is wise to avoid the eccentric or reactionary position<br/>&gt; &gt; that Just intonation is defined by vertical structures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never said it was!  My OP had the caveat--&quot;not necessarily sounded at the same time&quot;.</p><p>Yes- then you fogged this with the term &quot;dyad&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is not. Out<br/>&gt; &gt; in the real world, Just Intonation means the Just intonation of<br/>&gt; &gt; something. That something is, intervals, and the Just part means either<br/>&gt; &gt; beatless, or, tuned according to how it appears in a harmonic &gt;series-<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;naturally&quot;.  And &quot;dyad&quot; means of something, too- of a &quot;set&quot;, &gt;whether an<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;atonal&quot; set or of a &quot;tonal&quot; set (chord). &quot;Interval&quot; is neutral- &gt;and<br/>&gt; &gt; correct here.<br/>Igliashon:<br/>&gt; A single ratio, of x/y where x and y are integers, implies a two-note set.  What&apos;s the problem?</p><p>What you say is perfectly reasonable- but I already told you the problem. The problem is the way the words are already used. The tonal use won&apos;t fly, because an interval doesn&apos;t have to be a simultaneity, and the &quot;musical set-theory&quot; use won&apos;t fly because set-theory makes all kinds of assumptions, mostly specific to equal divisions of the octave, leading to conclusions about, for example, equivalencies.</p><p>If you conflate &quot;interval&quot; with &quot;dyad&quot;, you&apos;re implying vertical simultaneity or suggesting, via association with set-theory usage, things like, 3/2 is the same thing as 4/3.</p><p>I&apos;m not arguing with you. There&apos;s nothing wrong with your reasoning.<br/>Music terminology is full of unfortunate uses, misuses, abuses, and geese that should be gooses.</p><p>But in this case we do have an approriate word-  you wish to speak about intervals, why not just say &quot;intervals&quot;?</p><p>Igliashon:<br/>&gt; Only if you insist that dyad=notes sounded simultaneously (i.e. a &gt;vertical structure), which I don&apos;t think is a legitimate thing to &gt;insist upon.</p><p>I don&apos;t either. I don&apos;t think the lovely word &quot;dyad&quot; should have to be associated with either the vertical implication it has in tonal music usage, or the equivalency crap it has in the set-theory usage. Sadly it does.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That statement was made in the context of talking about &quot;maqam &gt;music&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Duh.</p><p>Not &quot;duh&quot;. Things get quoted out of context all the time on this list. Things get missed.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I assumed, incorrectly, that everyone in the discussion had a &gt;basic<br/>&gt; &gt; understanding of what we&apos;re calling &quot;maqam music&quot;, and maqam &gt;tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maqam tuning is what was being debated.</p><p>So a debate must be about those things about which we do not have a basic understanding? :-) I disagree.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In maqam music, there is  enormous evidence of the tendency to stepwise<br/>&gt; &gt; movement by superparticular interval, and of superparticular and simple<br/>&gt; &gt; (n+1/n for example) relationships within the basic Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; structure.  The enormous rational figures that appear in Islamic texts<br/>&gt; &gt; as a result of Pythagorean &quot;bearing plans&quot; don&apos;t change this- once<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;ve figured out where those intervals lie, you&apos;ll find that you still<br/>&gt; &gt; have those superparticular and simple intervals.</p><p>Igliashon<br/>&gt; Why?  What gives the actual intervals played any identity with &gt;superparticular ratios?  The fact that ancient Islamic texts say &gt;they do?</p><p>Does 19683/16384 LOOK like a superparticular interval to you? Don&apos;t be silly- what gives actual intervals identity with superparticular ratios is that they sound like superparticular intervals.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I suppose if people can insist that 12-tET is &quot;5-limit&quot; &gt;because that is what the ancient European theorists were aiming for &gt;with meantone, it&apos;s a bit hypocritical to turn around and insist &gt;that 24-tET maqam music is not 11-limit.  But that&apos;s more an &gt;argument against assuming 12-tET common-practice music is 5-limit &gt;than anything else.</p><p>There&apos;s that, too, glad you caught it. :-)</p><p>Igliashon:<br/>&gt; But if 27:22 is what is being approximated by a 350-cent interval, &gt;then that&apos;s not 11-limit...or at least, not 11-odd-limit.  That&apos;s &gt;27-limit.</p><p>Once again, that&apos;s just numerology in this context. If 27:22 is what&apos;s being approximated, then it&apos;s the superparticular ratio of 12:11 from the Pythagorean(and superparticular) ratio of 9:8 that&apos;s being approximated.</p><p>Igliashon:<br/>&gt; The straw man here is YOU insisting that the rest of us are &gt;fighting some kind of harmonic/Partchian straw man.</p><p>But you are, otherwise you wouldn&apos;t have just now come up with that &quot;27-limit&quot; nonsense.</p><p>&gt; You still have not produced one ounce of argument as to WHY 24-tET &gt;maqam music has to be interpreted as being 11-limit.  All the &gt;superparticular steps and such that you have mentioned as being used &gt;in maqam music suggest anything BUT 11-limit, and I&apos;ve yet to see &gt;any evidence that these superparticular rational steps are a &gt;necessary interpretation of the actual music played.</p><p>There you are, still fighting the straw man of an 11-limit harmonic structure, rather than addressing melodic intervals of ratios of 11. W</p><p>&gt; The argument is that 24-tET is not, in itself and outside of a &gt;musical context, inherently 11-limit.</p><p>I never said it was. It is potentially so, more so than the obviously Pythagorean 12-tET is &quot;5-limit&quot;, but that is not relevant here.

Well, if you can, then you should agree that if a piece of maqam music DOES match 24-tET, then it&apos;s NOT using ratios of 11.
