If<br/>the same intervals did occur within such a random generation the chances are<br/>it would not be subtended by an equal number of steps. Therefore I would say<br/>it is not a constant structure. The term is applied to  &quot;variations&quot; of an MOS<br/>where each interval is allowed to vary in size but the overall chain remains<br/>the same. I believe it would be safe to say that all constant structures have<br/>intervals that are repeated. Also only over the disjuctions does one scale<br/>step possibly transcend the size of one of its neighbors. At least that is<br/>what has been noticed so far!</p><p>&quot;Paul H.
