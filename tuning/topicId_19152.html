The standard, or<br/>_quarter-comma MT_, distributes the comma among four fifths, so that their<br/>octave-reduced sum is a just major third (5:4, 386.3 cents).  The fifth in<br/>quarter-comma MT has a size of 696.6 cents. This can be tuned by ear by first<br/>setting a just major third and then tempering the intermediate fifths. The name<br/>MT is derived from the size of the wholetone (193.15 cents), which divides the<br/>just major third equally and falls between between the just major (9:8) and<br/>minor (10:9) wholetones.</p><p>The major variants of MT include:</p><p>Third-comma MT, where an octave-reduced just major sixth (5:3, 884.4 cents) is<br/>the sum of three fifths of 693.3 cents),</p><p>Fifth-comma, where an octave-reduced just major seventh (15:8, 1088.3 cents) is<br/>the sum of five fifths of 697.6 cents),</p><p>Sixth-comma, where an octave-reduced just augmented fourth (45:32, 590.2 cents)<br/>is the sum of six fifths of 698.4 cents). After quarter-comma MT, sixth-tone<br/>temperament was the most widely used, especially in organs of the late baroque<br/>and classical eras.</p><p>The process of distributing the comma can continue indefinitely or in fractional<br/>variations, i.e. Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma MT. When the comma is distributed over<br/>eleven fifths, the result is equivalent to 12tet. Quarter-comma meantone is<br/>closely approximated by 31tet, third-comma by 19tet.</p><p>In quarter-comma meantone, with a keyboard of 12 keys per octave, eight major<br/>triads will have just major thirds, typically the triads on Eb through E. It is<br/>essential to note that although these tunings were chiefly used on keyboard<br/>instruments with finite numbers of keys per octave, MTs are not tunings with<br/>fixed numbers of pitches. The series of MT-fifths can be continued indefinitely,<br/>with each additional tone adding an additional available tonality. MT<br/>instruments with more than 12 keys per octave were not unknown, and G.F.H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ndel<br/>owned instruments with 14 and 16 keys per octave.</p><p>Music in MT is notated with the standard pythagorean scheme: seven nominals or<br/>staff positions without accidentals are modified by sharps (#) as one ascends by<br/>fifths and flats (b) as one descends. This process continues indefinitely. Due<br/>to the smaller size of fifth the chromatic semitone will be smaller than the<br/>diatonic. Thus in MT c# is lower in pitch than db, the opposite relationship is<br/>heard in pythagorean tuning.</p><p>MT was the pre-eminent keyboard tuning in the 17th and 18th centuries. The<br/>earliest recorded description of a MT tuning procedure is usually attributed to<br/>Pietro Aron in his _Toscanella_ (Venice, 1523). Common usage of MT or MT<br/>variants continued well into the 19th century with its final replacement by<br/>various well temperaments and 12tet occuring definitively only around 1850. MT<br/>has been widely revived for performances of early music; modern tracker organs<br/>in MT are not uncommon. Contemporary composers Gy&iuml;&iquest;&half;rgy Ligeti and Douglas Leedy<br/>have composed works in MT.</p><p>Given the pre-eminence of MT in the era when common practice tonality developed,<br/>it is useful to consider which qualities of MT were assumed by composers and<br/>positively reflected in musical repertoire.  These qualities included the purity<br/>of the major third and a good major triad; a preference for major over minor<br/>tonality (and when minor, a preference for g); a limited range of usable<br/>tonalities (typically Eb to A); a leading tone significantly lower than that of<br/>pythagorean or 12tet; a dissonant minor seventh, requiring resolution; an<br/>augmented sixth intonationally distinct from the minor seventh (indeed, the MT<br/>augmented sixth is a good approximation of a 7:4). More fundamental, however, is<br/>the assumption in harmonic practice that motion by mediant intervals, thirds and<br/>sixths, can also be heard as the sum of successive perfect fifths and fourths.<br/>Inasmuch as common practice tonality can be characterized by a distinctive<br/>interaction between triads with roots related by fifths and fourths and triads<br/>with roots related by thirds or sixths, it was MT that provided the intonational<br/>compromise to realize this interaction.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=19155 href="#19155">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2001 4:51:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; WHAT IS MEANTONE (MT)?<br/>&gt;<br/>..............</p><p>This information, and the like that will surely follow, will be<br/>extremely helpful for the neophytes like me.

By far the most non-ET modern organs are tuned in something between MT &amp;<br/>12-tet.

A d# in the key of C major will sound as<br/>badly out of tune as it will in B major - unless of course the eb key has been tuned,<br/>exceptionally, down to d#;  the difference is that the d# doesn&apos;t occur as often in C as in B.<br/>But it&apos;s irrelevant:  the point is simply the available tones i.e. spellings, not the keys i.e.<br/>tonalities.###</p><p>a leading tone significantly lower<br/>than that of<br/>pythagorean or 12tet; a dissonant minor seventh, requiring resolution;</p><p>###Isn&apos;t this a function of harmonic practice rather than tuning practice?  Maybe it&apos;s the term<br/>&apos;dissonant&apos; that&apos;s out of place here.  A sticky issue:  you can&apos;t very well substitute &apos;out of<br/>tune minor seventh&apos;.  And even if you could, its being out of tune would require not resolution<br/>but tuning.  Hmmmm.###</p><p>an<br/>augmented sixth intonationally distinct from the minor seventh<br/>(indeed, the MT<br/>augmented sixth is a good approximation of a 7:4).
