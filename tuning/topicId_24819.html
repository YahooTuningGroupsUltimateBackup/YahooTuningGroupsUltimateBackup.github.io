Some of<br/>them work out better than others, but they&apos;re all at least interesting. I<br/>think the endless repetition of the familiar harmonic progression allows me<br/>to become accustomed to the quirks of the different tunings over time.</p><p>I have a number of different categories of scales on the page. First, both<br/>3-limit and 5-limit JI. Then the near-JI scales (34-, 41-, 53-, and 72-TET<br/>so far), which sound very similar to the JI version (as you might expect).<br/>Then, a sampling of meantone scales (equal and non-equal), which also sound<br/>the way you&apos;d expect.</p><p>After the meantone scales, I grouped together the multiples of 5-TET in one<br/>group and the multiples of 7-TET in another. I expected some similarities<br/>between the members of each of these groups, but I&apos;m not sure if it<br/>actually turns out that way. This will take a bit of careful listening.</p><p>After that is a grab bag of all the equal scales that don&apos;t fit into any of<br/>the other categories. I&apos;m going to see if I can figure out any kind of<br/>pattern to them. The 8-TET version is in a category all by itself, since<br/>the 16/15 vanishes, reducing the 8 distinct notes of the canon down to a<br/>pentatonic scale! It has such a unique sound that I decided to revoice it<br/>with mallet instruments and other percussive sounds. I think this neglected<br/>scale deserves more attention.</p><p>Finally, I tried a few non-octave scales: Bohlen-Pierce, 88-CET, and a<br/>7-limit JI scale (1/1 28/25 6/5 5/4 7/5 3/2 25/16 42/25 7/4). I stretched<br/>the octaves of the original to 3/1 for the BP version, 1584 cents for the<br/>88-CET version, and shrunk them to 7/4 for the 7-limit non-octave version.<br/>They certainly have a unique sound, but I&apos;m not sure how well they work out<br/>for this piece. I&apos;ll have to try listening to them a few times to make<br/>sense of them.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 6:11:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Herman,</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/warped-canon.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/warped-canon.html</a></p><p>&gt; I put up a web page with all my retunings of the Pachelbel Canon.

The Macintosh used to (maybe still does) come with a sample BASIC program<br/>which plays a Bach piece (that famous cantata in 3/4 time). It was very easy to modify the sizes<br/>of tone, diatonic semitone, and chromatic semitone in this program. I&apos;ve discussed various<br/>people&apos;s reactions to various retunings of the piece in the past . . .</p></div><h3>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 10:01:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fantastic!</p><p>Thanks for the effort Robert!</p><p>GZ</p><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Herman,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/warped-canon.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/warped-canon.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I put up a web page with all my retunings of the Pachelbel Canon.

Once I decide on the size for the major<br/>third, fifth, and octave (or their equivalents), the rest follows<br/>automatically. If the best major third and minor third add up to be the<br/>same as the best fifth, I usually just use those if there isn&apos;t a good<br/>reason not to. If not, I pick whichever interval is closest to just and try<br/>out a few different sizes for the other intervals. In some cases, I had<br/>previous experience with the scale (such as 20-TET), which helped me to<br/>decide what to do with the triads. (I used Graham Breed&apos;s Midiconv program<br/>to do the retuning.)</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2001 8:00:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 11 Jun 2001 01:12:00 -0400, Herman Miller &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@IO.COM">hmiller@IO.COM</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I didn&apos;t try scales with less than 7 notes, although I guess 5-TET might be<br/>&gt;a good candidate.</p><p>I added 5-TET and 6-TET versions to the page.
