As far as I know, Hovhaness is still alive; he turned<br/>89 in March. I haven&apos;t heard much of his work that is more recent than the<br/>Mt. St Helens symphony. He is Composer in Residence at the Seattle Symphony.<br/>Does anyone know if there is a MIDI file of his<br/>&quot;Prayer of St. Gregory?&quot; That would be an interesting piece for alternate<br/>tunings.</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a> [<a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, June 05, 2000 8:56 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] More Hovhaness...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joseph!<br/>&gt; &gt; I have heard that he dreams many of his composition.
