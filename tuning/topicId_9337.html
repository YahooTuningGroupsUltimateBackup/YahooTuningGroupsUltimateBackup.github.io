I have a web site called<br/>&apos;Guitar and Fretted Instrument Resource Site&apos;. It contains web applications<br/>to view fretboard and chord charts for many instrument and many different<br/>tunings, with the option to submit new tunings and instruments. I put a lot<br/>of effort into make these applications switchable between different tunings<br/>but to my surprise no one has submitted any tuning or instrument requests.<br/>So I decided to search for other ways to link to my site that would<br/>encourage people who use alternate tunings to use the resources, that make<br/>it easy to select different tunings for instruments.  I would be pleased if<br/>you would consider adding my site to your list of links.</p><p>Find the site at :-</p><p><a href="http://pages.eidosnet.co.uk/liamredmond/guitar/index.html">http://pages.eidosnet.co.uk/liamredmond/guitar/index.html</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Liam D.
