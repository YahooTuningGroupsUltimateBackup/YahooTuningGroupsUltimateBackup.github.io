They&apos;re exactly what I used on the named tunes. I also found<br/>the exact scale tones for my 34 tone piece, &quot;From the West;&quot; the note<br/>values are mighty close to pure harmonics, for the most part...here they<br/>are (cents rounded off, nearest ratio provided):</p><p>D<br/>D#  (70 cents, 25/24)<br/>E    (212 cents, 9/8...8cents#)<br/>Fb  (282 cents, 20/17...1 cent#)<br/>F    (318 cents, 6/5...2 cents #)<br/>F#  (388 cents, 5/4   2 cents#)<br/>A    (706 cents, 3/2...2 cents #)<br/>A#  (776 cents, 25/16...4 cents#)<br/>B    (882 cents, 5/3...2 cents b)<br/>C#  (1094 cents, 15/8...6cents#)<br/>Db  (1129 cents, 48/25)  It took me about a month to work this scale<br/>out; I used my ear alone, was not trying to imitate any Eastern scales<br/>in particular. I like having both a major and minor 3rd; also like<br/>having 2 minor 3rds. Not a sound you hear in much traditional Western<br/>music...</p><p>   BTW...the 19 tone scale has a 9/7 that&apos;s 6 cents #...sounds a bit<br/>ragged harmonically, but melodically, it&apos;s very happening...Starrett and<br/>I like to use it a lot...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=27407 href="#27407">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/25/2001 8:05:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_27396.html#27396">/tuning/topicId_27396.html#27396</a></p><p>&gt;     Mats...maybe I missed something...why did the 19 tone scales<br/>seem odd to you?</p><p>I was rather wondering about this, too...
