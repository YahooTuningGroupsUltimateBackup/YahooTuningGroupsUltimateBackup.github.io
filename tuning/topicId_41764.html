This is a post by one person asking about alternative<br/>&gt; instruments and info on them. That&apos;s it. And why the doubt<br/>&gt; on checking out suggested instruments? I use what will work and I will<br/>&gt; check them out, thanks. And no one needs to hear more on this in the near<br/>&gt; future.
