Maybe signed numbers for these<br/>ascending or descending melodic intervals may make this point clearer, and<br/>further emphasize that these are sizes of steps, not names of notes.</p><p>Thus</p><p>D4   C#4      D4<br/> -27:25 +16:15</p><p>means that at least in Benedetti&apos;s view, we have a descending 27:25 step<br/>D4-C#4 followed by an ascending 16:15 C#4-D#4 step, resulting in a shift<br/>downward of 81:80.</p><p>Again, these are all melodic intervals or distances, not names of notes --<br/>the later convention one that I find curious. In a keyboard diagram,<br/>for example, I pick some pitch as the measuring point, e.g. C or F as<br/>&quot;1:1&quot; -- but that&apos;s just an arbitrary reference.</p><p>In the above example, for example, the mode might be D Dorian, among<br/>other things -- but all the diagram says to me is that we have a<br/>cadential semitone ascending from C# to D at a usual size of 16:15 for<br/>this system.</p><p>As for something like</p><p>G4  A4<br/>D4  D4<br/>G3  D4</p><p>I would say that indeed if we assume that all melodic and vertical<br/>intervals are pure 5-limit JI, then the interval G4-A4 must be a 9:8, and<br/>if the upper part then descends to another G4 involving a 10:9 step, we<br/>get an ascending 81:80 shift. In the example, we have a result of</p><p>  +9:8 -10:9 = +81:80<br/>G4   A4   G4</p><p>It seems to me that while some modern theorists might assign note-name<br/>ratios to pitches, the intervals have their own logic.</p><p>Maybe I should proof these examples again, and certainly you and others<br/>should feel free to point out alternative JI interpretations (a matter<br/>which could be of great interest), but I hope that this clarification may<br/>address at least a likely misunderstanding, opening the way for more<br/>discussion on assumptions and solutions (classic or adaptive).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
