First, why are these<br/>sorts of correspondences rarely, if ever, mentioned in association with<br/>music from the European tradition? It is a fact that everything,<br/>absolutely everything, in the Universe is composed of differing<br/>frequencies of vibrations...at it&apos;s deepest level, there actually is no<br/>such thing as solid matter (of course, a great unexplainable property of<br/>the Universe is exactly that...how did energy become solid?). And what<br/>sort of  smaller units of &quot;whatever&quot; is energy itself made of? This is<br/>vitally important to music and it&apos;s deeper purpose because, since we are<br/>indeed beings of vibration, it follows that sound, being a powerful,<br/>primal component of the Creation itself, can and does affect us on many<br/>levels, including those levels that bypass our everyday levels of<br/>consciousness.<br/>    Needless to say, this is why the subject of tunings is so<br/>significant to a deeper understanding of the effects music can<br/>have...tuning systems vibrate at different frequencies, and thus will<br/>have varying effects on the Universal structure, including humans and<br/>all living beings. For me, this is getting right to the heart of what I<br/>am really interested in exploring, and I thank Alison for the post. Why,<br/>indeed, is a morning raga a morning raga? Of course, as I mentioned,<br/>these sorts of ideas are seldom mentioned by &quot;Western&quot; musicians, and<br/>that&apos;s a frustrating thing for me. But, each time a musician plays<br/>music, vibrations are created, going out into the Universe, and<br/>affecting all they touch in some form or other. Ornette Coleman touched<br/>on this once, in a story on his life...he referred to the rhythm and<br/>blues he played in his formative years in Ft. Worth as &quot;music that made<br/>my people want to kill each other&quot; (I&apos;m paraphrasing, but it was close).<br/>Why, then, did this sort of music create such feelings in people? Was it<br/>the 12 tone scale, the feeling in the music, the environment it was<br/>played in? Something else?<br/>    Is the tuning the most important component of a piece? What about<br/>the spirit of the player, and his intent when playing? I think all of<br/>these factor in somehow, and it&apos;s a fascinating study...one which may<br/>never produce a &quot;scientific&quot;, definitive answer.<br/>Since the 12 tone eq tempered scale is way out of tune with the overtone<br/>series, does music produced in this system send out &quot;bad vibes,&quot; so to<br/>speak, a dissonance that is harmful, ultimately? Of course, other<br/>systems are not &quot;in tune,&quot; either...are they somehow harmful? I have<br/>seen various people mention, over the years, that just intonation is a<br/>natural tuning...does this mean music in this system is inherently<br/>beneficial? Or, again, is the intent, the passion, of the player, a<br/>significant part of the mix as well?<br/>    Alison mentioned that doing and experiencing were very important to<br/>an understanding of certain concepts...thus, if one does not do them,<br/>they will never experience the possible effects of the concept in<br/>question. Paramahansa Yogananda talked about listening for sounds in the<br/>inner ear as a powerful form of meditation, one that can lead one to<br/>hearing/feeling the primal, all encompassing &quot;OM&quot; sound/vibration.<br/>Problem is, if one does not DO the technique, chances are it will never<br/>happen for them...if it never happens, does that mean it doesn&apos;t exist?<br/>    It&apos;s great to see such a post as Alison&apos;s, and I hope that others<br/>will become interested in this sort of thread...tunings are a<br/>fascinating study, and can have effects which are deep and far<br/>reaching...the reason I am into this is to use what knowledge I can pick<br/>up to help me create something meaningful and lasting with my music. A<br/>knowledge of the deeper meanings of tuning, along with<br/>compositional/technical skills to apply the tuning expertise, will<br/>assure us of much meaningful music in the years to come...it&apos;s an<br/>awesome prospect...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=13368 href="#13368">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2000 5:47:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Neil Haverstick &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13360">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13360</a></p><p>&gt;Superb comments on Indian music, chakras, and the deeper meanings<br/>of music...many things come to mind from this post.</p><p>At this point, some list(en)ers might find the music of my Internet<br/>friend Sandhya Sanjana interesting.

[snip]<br/>&gt; these sorts of ideas are seldom mentioned by &quot;Western&quot; musicians, and<br/>&gt; that&apos;s a frustrating thing for me.</p><p>The answer is not too terribly elusive, really.  Western thought and Eastern/Hindu thought<br/>developed in different directions due to a different set of assumptions about the origin and<br/>nature of the cosmos: in a word, creation by a Person or Persons.  A brief overview of the<br/>ideas proposed by the ancient Greek philosophers, the early Christian theologians, and the<br/>Protestant Reformers would quickly make it clear why Western classical musicians held a view of<br/>music that prohibited making Hindu style direct correspondences between physical vibrations and<br/>mystical meanings.  Don&apos;t forget, virtually all medieval and Renaissance composers were Roman<br/>Catholic; many Baroque, Classical, and early Romantic composers thought in the Reformed<br/>tradition.  Papa Bach himself was a deeply devoted Lutheran back in the days when Lutherans<br/>were more conservative than today&apos;s typical &quot;far right&quot; Christians.  Note, though, that their<br/>perspective didn&apos;t prevent them from studying tuning, nor from making music which has been<br/>found meaningful transculturally.</p><p>&gt; Since the 12 tone eq tempered scale is way out of tune with the overtone<br/>&gt; series, does music produced in this system send out &quot;bad vibes,&quot; so to<br/>&gt; speak, a dissonance that is harmful, ultimately?</p><p>It&apos;s not that far off, really (for a low number equal temperament).  See the chart on various<br/>ET&apos;s degree of deviation from JI in terms of Harmonic Entropy, mentioned the other day:<br/><a href="http://personal.bna.bellsouth.net/bna/d/f/dfin/DefectsETs.htm">http://personal.bna.bellsouth.net/bna/d/f/dfin/DefectsETs.htm</a><br/>If it were way out, it wouldn&apos;t likely have become a standard way of approximating 5-limit<br/>harmonic progressions for billions of people over more than a century.  It&apos;s a lot further off<br/>than 31 or 41, sure, but it&apos;s also a lot more manageable.</p><p>&gt; I have<br/>&gt; seen various people mention, over the years, that just intonation is a<br/>&gt; natural tuning...does this mean music in this system is inherently<br/>&gt; beneficial?</p><p>JI is about as natural as a tree shaped like a perfect triangle, or a perfectly spherical<br/>rock.  That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not a good basis for a tuning system.  If it is inherently good,<br/>and if the most generally beneficial non-JI tunings are those that approximate JI well, that<br/>fact might point to something (or Someone) which transcends nature and which is absolutely<br/>good.  Of course, any such conclusion, taken alone, would depend on how you define and measure<br/>&quot;beneficial.&quot;</p><p>&gt; tunings are a<br/>&gt; fascinating study, and can have effects which are deep and far<br/>&gt; reaching...the reason I am into this is to use what knowledge I can pick<br/>&gt; up to help me create something meaningful and lasting with my music.</p><p>Me too!  I agree.  I think that&apos;s a very good reason for the study of tuning.  In fact, the<br/>search for the uses of various tunings cannot be separated from the search for meaning (in the<br/>most general sense) for me.</p><p>&gt; A knowledge of the deeper meanings of tuning, along with<br/>&gt; compositional/technical skills to apply the tuning expertise, will<br/>&gt; assure us of much meaningful music in the years to come...it&apos;s an<br/>&gt; awesome prospect...Hstick</p><p>Indeed!

A perfect performance of<br/>&quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;, the second movement of the Khachaturian Piano<br/>Concerto, Phil Ochs&apos; &quot;Pleasures of the Harbor&quot; and the third movement of the<br/>Shostakovich 5th symphony will do it for me almost every time.</p><p>&gt; There is a similar effect with &quot;xeno-&quot;intervals,<br/>&gt; when you are just starting to understand some<br/>&gt; new identities on the ladder of primes. At this<br/>&gt; point, their emotion feels very strong, and you just<br/>&gt; have to listen again and again because feels good.</p><p>How are you defining &quot;xeno-intervals&quot;?? When I hear the term &quot;xentonality&quot;,<br/>I think of the work of William Sethares, which uses non-standard scales and<br/>non-harmonic timbres designed to minimize a measure of dissonance. They do<br/>indeed sound &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;strange&quot;, which is what the &quot;xen&quot; prefix implies,<br/>and there is certainly an absence of dissonance. Are they &quot;addicting&quot;,<br/>though? I suspect in the hands of a truly great and inspired composer, they<br/>could be. The compositions on Sethares&apos; &quot;Xentonality&quot; are pleasant; they<br/>don&apos;t seem to be meant to inspire emotions.</p><p>&gt; For exemple, when you accept 5-limit intervals, not as<br/>&gt; out-of-tune imitations of 3-limit (or 12TET), but as<br/>&gt; new identities, they start to feel &quot;right&quot;. When you<br/>&gt; let go of 12TET as your frame of reference, 5-limit<br/>&gt; music starts to feel sweet. If 3-limit is solid like<br/>&gt; an oak tree, 5-limit moves like a river.</p><p>An interesting metaphor, Kami. I must confess I have not heard any of your<br/>music. I discovered just intonation many years ago in &quot;On The Sensations of<br/>Tone&quot; and did some primitive experiments with it on a military surplus<br/>computer when I was in graduate school. Right now, I am exploring just<br/>intonation *and* xentonality, which I am treating as separate for the<br/>moment.</p><p>&gt; It is also possible to resist the emotional pull<br/>&gt; of a performance and &quot;fly above&quot; it, instead of<br/>&gt; &quot;going with the flow.&quot; But then, this takes a<br/>&gt; certain degree of concentration and makes other<br/>&gt; activities difficult, because you are still<br/>&gt; focusing on the (dual/complement of the) emotions<br/>&gt; in the music.</p><p>Hmmm ... reminds me of the old psychology joke, &quot;Don&apos;t think of a blue<br/>elephant!&quot; :-). Seriously, though, there is, no matter how much you analyze<br/>a piece of music and determine its structure, something about a truly great<br/>work that defies analysis.<br/>--<br/>M.
