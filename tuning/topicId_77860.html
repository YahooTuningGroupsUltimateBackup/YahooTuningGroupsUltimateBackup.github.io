The wave of C major is NOT fully periodic, as it&lt; would have to be in rational multiple relationships to be periodic.&lt;&lt; The wave of C Major is perfectly periodic. I sent you its response and&lt;&lt; measured the periodicity and stability of all triads during thirty minutes. When for the first time I looked at the Piagui graph responses, its aesthetic and apparent periodic display induced me to call them &quot;perfect triads&quot;; it would have been better to call them &quot;almost perfect triads&quot;. In the other hand, the considerable effort I did along eight years to define the three variants of Piagui scales whose complicate deduction required peculiar and unusual mathematical methods deserve me the right of make a mistake.&lt; The C and the G together will be periodic. The C and the E together&lt; will NOT be periodic, as the two frequencies are in IRRATIONAL NUMBER&lt; relationships to one another. The C and the G are in a rational 3/2&lt; relationship to one another, meaning that for every 3 cycles of the G there will&lt; have been 2 cycles of the C. This property does not apply to the C and&lt; the E, the waves of which will NEVER sync up enough to be actually&lt; periodic. If you have measured the C major triad&apos;s&lt; waveform and determined it to be periodic, then you have made an error&lt; somewhere, because it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.The musical instruments are mainly in hands of musicians andengineering. You Know that the exact values of some numeric relations in music are not possible to put to work. That is why you are considering non conventional fractions to satisfy your object.  I understand and agree with you on the definitions given in thetwo previous paragraphs. At the moment and since the schisma (32805/32768) = 1,00112915039,,,is the smallest consonance that can be detected by the ear of man, I am just considering for tone E the frequency 1,26125 =(1009 / 800) rather than 1,26134482288. The deviation produced by 1,26125 with respectto the original frequency of E is (1,26125 / 1,26134482288) = 0,99992482398. An error of (1-- 0,99992482398) = 0,000075176 that is absolutely lower than the schisma&acute;s deviation (1,00112915039,,, - 1) = 0,001129,,,,   &gt; The wave might be close enough to periodic to be indistinguishable,&gt; but that major third will certainly be a far cry from 5/4.You are quite acquainted that the equal tempered major third is almost equal to (63/50) = 1,26 At one millimeter far from Piaguimajor third.The author W. T. Bartholomew in &quot;Acoustics of Music&quot; wrote:&quot;Many of these scales persist in various parts of the world today. It is only in &quot;Western music&quot;, where a harmonic development evolved, that the diatonic scale as we know it became predominant.&quot;&gt; &lt; My biggest problem with the scale is that the fifths that are better&gt; &lt; are only better by 2 cents, which is indistinguishable. The fifths&gt; &lt; that are worse, though, are flatter by 6 cents, which is very&gt; &lt; distinguishable.&lt;&gt; Until you give the total amount of indistinguishable and &lt;&gt; distinguishable cents in both scales Piagui and equal &lt;&gt; tempered, your incomplete report has no sense. It is time &lt;&gt; to know the truth in both sides. I know that truth, however &lt;&gt; prefer that another person that is not involved in the subject do it.&lt; That is a lot of math. If you would like to provide us with a chart of&lt; the errors from each interval, the RMS tuning error and TOP error and&lt; all of that, as well as a corresponding chart from 12-tet, then I&apos;d be&lt; happy to compare and take a look and help you interpret what the&lt; charts mean.I will see what I can do to make the needed approach at my way. It would be a limited discussion and explanation and hope that despite its incomplete final data it could give clear results. Would you explain me what do you mean by &quot;the errors from each interval, the RMS tuning error and TOP error&quot;?&lt; I will say that you cannot claim that the flat perfect fifth, which is&lt; 4 cents flat from 12-equal, will be indistinguishable, but that the&lt; major third, which is 2 cents sharp from 12-equal, will be&lt; <a href="http://distinguishable.As">distinguishable.As</a> you have probably noted, I lived too far from cents. Last week I started to learn a bit about cents. At the moment my background is the acknowledge that each equal temperedsemitone is divided in one hundred cents, that is all, so this evening I will use my brain to understand the above paragraph.I will be better next month. In many occasions I read:,,,etc  with ratio 9 : 10, or 182 cents.. &iquest; WHAT ON THE EARTH...?  I know that the 9 : 10 relation works in the Just Intonation scale of Aristoxenus but for a man whose background on cents is only the 1200 divisions of any octave &iquest;what is the connection between the ratio (9 : 10 ) and the number of cents of it?&lt; It&apos;s a lose-lose: whenever the fifth is better than 12-equal, the&lt; major third will be slightly worse, and whenever the major third is&lt; better than 12-equal, the perfect fifth will significantly worse.I need a doctor.&iquest;Did you ever added the deviation cents of all the fifths, fourths and thirds of the equal tempered scale?&lt; The equal tempered scale has an approximation of 3/2 that is roughly 2&lt; cents sharp, an approximation of 4/3 that is roughly 2 cents flat, an&lt; approximation of the 5/4 major third that is roughly 14 cents sharp,&lt; and an approximation of the 6/5 minor third that is roughly 16 cents&lt; flat. If you treat the equal tempered minor third as an approximation&lt; to 19/16, then it is only 2.5 cents sharp.This paragraph contains basic data for the projected chart of errors Piagui/equal tempered.&gt;&gt; &lt;That C-E is not periodic by any measure of the scale - in order for&gt;&gt; &lt;that dyad to be periodic, the two frequencies would have to be in some&gt;&gt; &lt;kind of rational relationship to one another. That E-G is pretty close&gt;&gt; &lt;to a 19/16 ratio and the C-G is exactly 3/2. That means that the C-E&gt;&gt; &lt;is going to be pretty close to a 24/19 ratio. BUT, even though it&apos;s&gt;&gt; &lt;going to be close to 24/19, having a scale that is close to periodic&gt;&gt; &lt;still won&apos;t mean that it&apos;s &quot;perfect&quot; for what western music&gt;&gt; &lt;traditionally wants, which is a major third that is close to 5/4. &gt; About E-G = (1,5 / 1,26134462288 ) = Eb = (2)(1/4)) = 1,189207115&gt; This quotient is the needed relation between E and G and at the same&gt; time another support of E = 1,26134462288.The minor third that most people want to use is 6/5. The quarter of anoctave that is used in 12-tet and your scale is not 6/5 by any means,and is closer to 19/16. It is a workable approximation to 6/5 thatmost people won&apos;t notice: certainly does not make the scale offer&quot;perfect&quot; harmony. &iquest;How do you know that most people want to use 6/5 ? (19 /16) = 1,1875 --- You probably prefer (6/5) = 1,2Perhaps that scale is offering &quot;perfect&quot; harmony and you are the only capable man to recognize a &quot;perfect&quot; harmony. Piagui minor third and equal tempered minor third equals to 1,189207115. Possible new minor third in Piagui scales = (1189 / 1000) = 1,189. The inverse of the Deviation from 1,189207115 = (1,189 / 1,189207115) = 0,99982583773,The deviation is (1/0,99982583773) = 1,0001741926. Since 1,0001741926 is lower than the schisma (1,00112915039), it cannot be detected by the human ear.I don&apos;t know offhand what decimal numbers relate to what justrelationships. Please write using fractions and exponents, notdecimal.I will do it.&gt; The tones (2)(1/4), (2)(1/2), (2)(3/4) and 2 are fundamental frequencies of&gt; (Eb, F#, A and Do) of Piagui and equal tempered scale. Thanks to this&gt; feature the only correct chord of equal tempered is DIMIN. DO, DIM. Eb, DIM F#, DIM&gt; A.If you arbitrarily define the &quot;correct&quot; diminished chord as 4 equal divisions of the octave.Curiously when I was deducing the progression of 612 musicalcells using the schisma and two commas, the 4 equal divisions of the octave appeared spontaneously as well as many other basicparameters. Since I did not programmed these divisions I thought that they emerged by decision of nature and therefore the four cells are probably correct; as a matter of fact they are also workingin the equal tempered scale and will probably work in the scale you are &quot;perfecting&quot;. So I did not arbitrarily defined how to call to the 4equal divisions of the octave.&gt; Note Eb = (2)(1/4)) = 1,189207115&gt; Regards&gt; MARIO PIZARRO Mario, I will say this: You cannot &quot;define&quot; perfect harmony to besomething that is not in accordance with what the music community atlarge needs, and then claim that your scale offers perfect harmony.For the vast majority of western music out there, especially baroqueand classical pieces that were composed in some kind of meantonetuning, then your scale will be just as imperfect, if not slightlymore in certain situations, than 12 tone equal temperament. Mike,I have already explained in the second paragraph in this message why I called &quot;perfect harmony&quot; to the visual expression of the triad responses. Let us do better things like the chart of errors now that you have promised me that you will teach me how to interpret this chart.The fact that the wave appears to be periodic doesn&apos;t matter, as theHammond B3 organ&apos;s waves are all perfectly periodic, but the noteshave relationships to one another like 2808 / 2975. After a certainpoint, the ear can no longer hear the periodicity of the wave exceptfor a slight difference in beating. I don&apos;t know how you define &quot;perfect,&quot; but the fact of the matter isthat periodicity does not mean &quot;perfection&quot; of a chord or a triad. Theother thing is that not only is the major third in the &quot;perfect&quot; chordeven FARTHER from 5/4 just, the perfect fifths in the &quot;imperfectchords&quot;, of which there are four in piagui, are even further from justthan the &quot;perfect&quot; piagui thirds are. I think it is an interesting scale with interesting properties that incertain situations might lead to it being more advantageous than12-equal. I do not think it is a perfect scale that will handle themusical requirements of most music any better than 12-equal, but incertain situations, it may. -Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77862 href="#77862">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2008 12:53:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; When for the first time I looked at the Piagui graph responses,<br/>&gt; its aesthetic and apparent periodic display induced me to call them<br/>&gt; &quot;perfect triads&quot;; it would have been better to call them<br/>&gt; &quot;almost perfect triads&quot;.</p><p>Then the Piagui scale offers &quot;almost perfect harmony,&quot; just like<br/>12-equal.

The 12 tone equal tempered scale has a note in it that is a 700<br/>cent interval away from the root. The perfect fifth of 12-equal, in<br/>other words, is very slightly flat from the pure 3/2.

Furthermore, you seem to<br/>insist that the schisma is the lowest interval that can be detected by<br/>ear, but I estimate the threshold to be much higher. That is my<br/>opinion. I think Piagui will be useful in certain circumstances and<br/>less useful in others.
