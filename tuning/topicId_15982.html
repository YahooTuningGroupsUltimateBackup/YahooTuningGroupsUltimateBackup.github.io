To be<br/>honest, while I&apos;ve always been fascinated with it myself, I didn&apos;t<br/>really know what to make of it musically.  That is, until recently.<br/>Many years ago I was heavily into weaving on a four-harness loom.<br/>When a friend of mine sent me a paper several years ago on tiling the<br/>plane with the usual diatonic and other scale forms, it hit me that<br/>there was a deep relationship: math-weaving-music.  The following is<br/>only one possible direction this relationship might take.</p><p>The list may have discussed this before, in which case I apologize<br/>for not doing my homework, but what really got me excited (after<br/>slapping myself in the head and shouting &quot;well, DUH!&quot;) was<br/>surf-stumbling into the following web site at the computer science<br/>department at Arizona State:</p><p><a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/Sequences/sequences.html">http://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/Sequences/sequences.html</a></p><p>All of a sudden I was compelled to ask, what happens when you apply a<br/>modulus to an infinite sequence?  In the case of Fibonacci, the result<br/>(which can be seen visually at the above site which shows<br/>treadle/harness sequences for looms) is extremely interesting and<br/>provocative for compositional theory, whether you&apos;re considering<br/>pitch-class sets, point or duration-class sets, or macro-design<br/>proportions.</p><p>Again, hoping I&apos;m not repeating what you already know, here&apos;s a<br/>couple of examples.  For reference, here&apos;s the classic Fibonacci<br/>again:</p><p>1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,... ad infinitum.  Now, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;<br/>isn&apos;t very helpful in a piece of music we hope will end in our<br/>lifetime; plus, the larger the terms get, the more difficult they are<br/>to &quot;grasp&quot; conceptually.  So here&apos;s what happens when we begin to<br/>short circuit the series by modding it out:</p><p>mod 2:<br/>               1,1,2,1,1,2,...<br/>Pretty simple (like 2 sixteenths and an eighth repeated over and<br/>over); as you can see, Fib mod 2 has a period of 3.  Now things get<br/>interesting.</p><p>mod 3 (period = 8):<br/>               1,1,2,3,2,2,1,3,1,1,2,3,2,2,1,3,...<br/>For the next couple I&apos;ll just give the basic repeating sequence.</p><p>mod 4 (period = 6):<br/>               1,1,2,3,1,4,...</p><p>mod 5 (period = 20):<br/>               1,1,2,3,5,3,3,1,4,5,4,4,3,2,5,2,2,4,1,5,...</p><p>I&apos;ll let you work out the next few if you&apos;re interested - mod 6 has<br/>period 24, mod 7 has period 16, mod 8 has period 12, etc. (BTW, the<br/>above site incorrectly states that Fib mod 10 has no discernible<br/>period; in fact, its period is 56).  One more comment.  The Fib mod 5<br/>(and some other modded-out Fibs) can be stacked to show an additional<br/>internal symmetry:</p><p>               1,1,2,3,5,<br/>               3,3,1,4,5,<br/>               4,4,3,2,5,<br/>               2,2,4,1,5,<br/>               ...</p><p>So the rows reflect Fib mod 5, and the columns reflect the<br/>permutation (1342)(5) (i.e., each vertical term t = 3(t - 1) mod 5)</p><p>The Tribonacci sequence Paul has brought up, if we cap it at mod 5,<br/>has a period of 31:</p><p>1,1,1,3,5,4,2,1,2,5,3,5,3,1,4,3,3,5,1,4,5,5,4,4,3,1,3,2,1,1,4,...</p><p>At mod 3, it has a period of 13:</p><p>1,1,1,3,2,3,2,1,3,3,1,1,2,...</p><p>The Arizona site (built by Ralph Griswold) has other interesting<br/>&quot;weaving&quot; sequences, e.g.,</p><p>Pell<br/>Perrin<br/>Hofstadter&apos;s chaotic sequence<br/>Triangular (pentagonal, septagonal, undecagonal) numbers [really<br/>cool]<br/>Versum [surprise in the midst of chaos - keep scrolling to see it]<br/>Connell and Lower &amp; Upper Wythoff sequences [irregular regularity]<br/>Irrationals (e, pi, etc.) [not as irrational as you might think when<br/>modded out and squinted at]</p><p>It also gives you  a gate to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer<br/>Sequences where you can look up any sequence ever discovered (at least<br/>that&apos;s the claim).</p><p>Like I said, I didn&apos;t check all the past tuning issues I&apos;ve missed,<br/>so I hope I&apos;m not repeating a discussion that already exhausted the<br/>subject.</p><p>Steve</p><p>Stephen Soderberg<br/>Music Division<br/>Library of Congress</p></div><h3><a id=15999 href="#15999">ðŸ”—</a>Allan Myhara &#x3C;amyhara@mb.sympatico.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2000 6:00:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Stephen Guy Soderberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:SSOD@LOC.GOV">SSOD@LOC.GOV</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I got lost a while back during list site drift and, due to several<br/>&gt; offbeat projects consuming my time, didn&apos;t get around to resubscribing<br/>&gt; until now.

The period for the Fib<br/>mod 10 is 60 (not 56).  Reason (but not excuse) for my error: I didn&apos;t<br/>bother to think it through but simply counted the sequence terms as<br/>presented on the Arizona site up to the reappearance of 1,1.  I don&apos;t<br/>feel too bad though, since, as I said, the guy who put this site up is<br/>Ralph Griswold (early developer of SNOBOL and former head of<br/>Programming Research and Development at Bell Labs - retired now and<br/>into weaving and number theory).  Evidently geniuses don&apos;t take a lot<br/>of trouble balancing checkbooks (or are possibly checkbook impaired).<br/>But I don&apos;t have the excuse :-)</p><p>Chagrinned,</p><p>Steve</p><p>Stephen Soderberg<br/>Music Division<br/>Library of Congress</p></div>
