It refers to music from<br/>northern India, as opposed to &quot;Carnatic Classical Music&quot;, which is from<br/>southern India.</p><p>While Hindu religious themes are common in the lyrics of Hindustani<br/>classical songs, there have been and continue to be many important<br/>non-Hindu (especially Muslim) composers and performers in the Hindustani<br/>Classical music tradition.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Christopher J. Chapman</p></div>
