As you can see from the quote below on the first page,  after his preface, Harrison had his own ideas about the comma:</p><p> &quot;the natural Notes of Melody are certainly free from all the inconsistent nonsense arising from the Imagination of there being a Tone Major of 9 to 8, a Tone Minor of 10 to 9, and a nonsensical Comma (as being their difference) of 81 to 80, &quot; -<br/>John Harrison.</p><p>As I understand it Lou Harrison and many other integer frequency ratio advocates, have yet to be able to hear or tune beyond  commas, and this simple arithmetic &quot;nonsense&quot;.</p><p>I welcome your flames ;-)</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a> (LucyScaleDevelopments)<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a><br/>for Lucytuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/> or <a href="http://www.lucytune.co.uk">http://www.lucytune.co.uk</a>  or <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div>
