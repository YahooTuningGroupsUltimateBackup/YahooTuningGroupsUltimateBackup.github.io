I&apos;m<br/>guessing he never did find it, or didn&apos;t know what to make of it,<br/>since I&apos;ve emailed him a few times since, to ask if any progress, and<br/>have had no reply.</p><p>My guess is that the great highland bagpipes started off with an<br/>approximately neutral third and sixth (due to their Arabic past?) and<br/>approximate Pythagorean fourth and minor sevenths. (They have<br/>apparently always had Pythagorean fifth and major second). But these<br/>have moved around over the years according to what may be no more than<br/>fashion (which may have been influenced by the fashion for 12-equal on<br/>other instruments. But never outside a range of about 50 cents. And<br/>undoubtedly there are always many old pipes around with unfashionable<br/>tunings at any given time, and if you wait long enough they&apos;ll come<br/>back into vogue again. Anyway, that&apos;s my guess.</p><p>I expect Ewan MacPherson&apos;s measurements are quite accurate and<br/>represent the current fashion.</p><p>You can see an official tuning sheet from the Australian Pipe Band<br/>college in 1991, on my website at<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/AFBPAtuning.gif">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/AFBPAtuning.gif</a><br/>They apparently hadn&apos;t caught up with the fashion for a 7/4 seventh<br/>and a narrow octave, since it is<br/>9/10 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1</p><p>But there is apparently no such thing as _THE_ bagpipe tuning. It is<br/>apparently a somewhat flexible thing. Most flexible are the third and<br/>sixth, next the seventh, and also apparently the fourth.

Additionally, what is apparently unclear is how<br/>&gt; adjustments by comma take place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Granted there may be exceptions, the essential functioning of a<br/>&gt; barbershop arrangement avoids most comma shifts by putting<br/>&gt; the new note in a different part, usually in a different octave.<br/>&gt; Simply because the parts tend to stay on similar parts of the<br/>&gt; chord, when E changes from being a third of a chord to a root, it<br/>&gt; usually is not held over, but rather appears in a different part.<br/>&gt; Certainly many notes are held over through chords, but once the<br/>&gt; SINGLE jump in root has been made after leaving tonic, the<br/>&gt; circle of fifths progression back no longer needs any shifts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the accuracy, certainly we are dealing with real world, but I<br/>&gt; am pretty confident that I can accurately sing 81/64 instead of 5/4<br/>&gt; when appropriate.  For the most part, the bass often has the root<br/>&gt; and generally sings 81/64 because 5/4 would only occur with a<br/>&gt; tonic chord (because barbershop harmony uses relative minor<br/>&gt; and mediant chords far less often than dominant circle of fifths<br/>&gt; chords).  The other parts do not actually need to hear the root to<br/>&gt; sing correctly, they only need to sense that the harmony needs to<br/>&gt; be based on 81/64, and they will sing JI intervals for that chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe that every successful barbershop arrangement<br/>&gt; (meaning that excellent barbershoppers could comfortably sing<br/>&gt; it) could be spelled out in strict JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the most controversial statement I&apos;m making is this:  If it<br/>&gt; cannot be spelled in strict JI, then I believe it is either completely<br/>&gt; innaccessible music that does not have real musical function, or<br/>&gt; (more likely) its musical function relies on ambiguity and<br/>&gt; vagueness.  Put another way, if a piece is not intended to be<br/>&gt; vague (for various musical reasons) then it can be spelled in<br/>&gt; STRICT JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll form this as a question/challenge:  can you find a musical<br/>&gt; phrase that could be both impossible to have in strict JI, and<br/>&gt; also completely clear and precise as far as pitch intention as<br/>&gt; percieved by the intended audience?  (surely you as a composer<br/>&gt; could truly intend that exact 11EDO note, but could a listener<br/>&gt; understand it that way?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh and to answer your question, I did not take Dr. Richards&apos;<br/>&gt; class.  I hope to at some point, but I did have a lengthy<br/>&gt; discussion with him about my perceptions and questions, and<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read his book.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the excellent thoughts everyone, keep &apos;em coming.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; The official definition of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; may be found at...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/adaptiveji.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/adaptiveji.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 13<br/>&gt;    Date: Mon, 22 Sep 2003 15:02:33 -0700 (PDT)<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Robert T.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; guessing he never did find it, or didn&apos;t know what to make of it,<br/>&gt; since I&apos;ve emailed him a few times since, to ask if any progress, and<br/>&gt; have had no reply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My guess is that the great highland bagpipes started off with an<br/>&gt; approximately neutral third and sixth (due to their Arabic past?) and<br/>&gt; approximate Pythagorean fourth and minor sevenths. (They have<br/>&gt; apparently always had Pythagorean fifth and major second). But these<br/>&gt; have moved around over the years according to what may be no more than<br/>&gt; fashion (which may have been influenced by the fashion for 12-equal on<br/>&gt; other instruments. But never outside a range of about 50 cents. And<br/>&gt; undoubtedly there are always many old pipes around with unfashionable<br/>&gt; tunings at any given time, and if you wait long enough they&apos;ll come<br/>&gt; back into vogue again. Anyway, that&apos;s my guess.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I expect Ewan MacPherson&apos;s measurements are quite accurate and<br/>&gt; represent the current fashion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can see an official tuning sheet from the Australian Pipe Band<br/>&gt; college in 1991, on my website at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/AFBPAtuning.gif">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/AFBPAtuning.gif</a><br/>&gt; They apparently hadn&apos;t caught up with the fashion for a 7/4 seventh<br/>&gt; and a narrow octave, since it is<br/>&gt; 9/10 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there is apparently no such thing as _THE_ bagpipe tuning. It is<br/>&gt; apparently a somewhat flexible thing. Most flexible are the third and<br/>&gt; sixth, next the seventh, and also apparently the fourth. Here are what<br/>&gt; would seem to be the upper and lower limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 9/10 1/1 9/8 5/4 27/20 3/2  5/3 9/5 2/1<br/>&gt; 7/8  1/1 9/8 350c 4/3  3/2 850c 7/4 2/1-30c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I love the bagpipes for the fact that, of all instruments used<br/>&gt; commonly in the west, they alone have held out against the 12-equal tide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 16<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 01:55:35 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@bigpond.net.au">d.keenan@bigpond.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Barbershop and JI vs. adaptive issues<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; And the most controversial statement I&apos;m making is this:  If it<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot be spelled in strict JI, then I believe it is either completely<br/>&gt; &gt; innaccessible music that does not have real musical function, or<br/>&gt; &gt; (more likely) its musical function relies on ambiguity and<br/>&gt; &gt; vagueness.

The &quot;harsher&quot; thirds are not harsh at all if they are used<br/>&gt; &gt; melodically, as was the custom through JS Bach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was wondering what you made of the quote from Paul Poletti&apos;s article, where<br/>&gt; he talked about Werckmeisters approach to tuning the harpsichord note being<br/>&gt; based on Werck III, but on a rough 1/6 comma meantone starting point...the<br/>&gt; evidence is apparantly from Werckmeister&apos;s own work. Yes it&apos;s not conclusive,<br/>&gt; but it does suggest something about the use of different tuning based on<br/>&gt; whether it was an organ setting or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;To these ears, Neidhardts&apos; tuning IS more beautiful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; than Werckmeisters&apos;, but then were not arguing facts. To see what I mean,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tune your keyboard instrument to it and listen to it. The rest is useless<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sophistry. It&apos;s all about delighting the ear, no?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry to be a curmudgeon, but my ears love Werckmeister as beautiful.<br/>&gt; &gt; Modern ears are not the issue, though.  For example, many modern ears care<br/>&gt; &gt; little for the microtonal interals that tickle so many on this List.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True enough...although I&apos;d say that the intervals are not as much the problem<br/>&gt; as how they are used...as a small example, I can see an audience being turned<br/>&gt; off by 11:8 ratios when used in the low bass register as a bare dyad---then<br/>&gt; being delighted by the same when reinforced by a full five voice 4:5:6:7:9<br/>&gt; underneath......and rightly so!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To the past generations as &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; much as to us....why wouldn&apos;t they use a more &apos;rich tuning&apos; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Neidhardt when they had a choice (i.e., they weren&apos;t on an organ)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are many reasons.  Inertia of a previous tuning (as Werckmeister<br/>&gt; &gt; predates Neidhardt), different compositional choices (as melodic versus<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic interest), relevance to other prominent tunings (such as a<br/>&gt; &gt; significant meantone match to a well-temperament), and ease and speed of<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning (Werckmeister is rapid in comparison to the &quot;paper&quot; temperaments of<br/>&gt; &gt; Neidhardt).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t buy it. In fact, the Neidhardt tuning I described is about the same<br/>&gt; effort as Werck III, less just fifths notwithstanding. You could, I suppose,<br/>&gt; only advance your argument against Neidhardt IV (ET), but that was really<br/>&gt; never what I was ever referring to....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Besides, &apos;inertia&apos; and &apos;ease and speed&apos; seem to have not worked against the<br/>&gt; onslaught of ET anyway !!! If that argument held, we would still be doing 1/4<br/>&gt; comma meantone in an ubiquitous way today.....(it would be nice for pop music<br/>&gt; and folk music, I think, and have always thought--I&apos;ve even written<br/>&gt; progressive folk-rock tunes in meantone!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And Werckmeister was instrumental (pardon the pun) in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bringing other instruments into the church to make music with the organ.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure I follow what you mean.....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just that. Werckmeister made an early pitch (pardon the pun again) for<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments to be allowed into the church to make music with the organ.  It<br/>&gt; &gt; was more usual at the time for there to be a segregation of the organ with<br/>&gt; &gt; the other instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Off-kilter humor: He probably said to the priests, &quot;listen, I can get you more<br/>&gt; young boys to molest if you allow more instrumentalists to play here.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Also, what makes you think Werckmeister self-deprecates his circular<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;chromatic temperaments?  I haven&apos;t seen anything of this kind anywhere<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I am on the look out.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was mistakenly giving the wrong impression. Not some much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &apos;self-deprication&apos;, but a healthy sense of what works in a given<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; practical setting, and what is best, even if it&apos;s not &apos;your own<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning&apos;....plus, there<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was a common practice tuning that defied specific mathematical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; description, i.e., one used one&apos;s ears and &apos;guess-timated&apos;. In other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; words, no one &apos;owned&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the &apos;ordinary temperament&apos; of the 18th century, because its description<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was not as mathematically precise as we now are. They didn&apos;t use cents.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They used<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; their ears!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, but ears are trained.  They are not given a sense of musical<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament perfection at birth.  The ears are best judges when there are<br/>&gt; &gt; specific and exact intervals that they are measuring against, for example<br/>&gt; &gt; pure fifths and octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we agree!?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As you may know a young Neidhardt was in a contest in 1706 in Jena with an<br/>&gt; &gt; elder Bach.  He lost the contest of tuning the organ because the Bach<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning was considered by all listening to be more singable.  It is likely<br/>&gt; &gt; that Neidhardt was tuning to the equal temperament he first promoted.  The<br/>&gt; &gt; Bach, eldest son of Johann Christoph Bach (Uncle to J.S.) was certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; unequal at this time (and likely Werckmeister III in my estimation).  This<br/>&gt; &gt; is a tuning duel, essentially, and ET lost.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where is the source for this interesting story. How do you know it was ET?<br/>&gt; Neidhardt has at least 4 tuning we know of.....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The statement that it was likely Werckmeister III is purely speculative.<br/>&gt; Kellner tried to reconstruct Bach&apos;s tuning, but his ideas are also<br/>&gt; speculative. This is history, an impure science, like astronomy. Are there<br/>&gt; Black holes for sure? We think so. But history, without written records, is<br/>&gt; even fuzzier. Again, Bach left nothing on the subject to my knowledge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Aaron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 19<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 05:50:32 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;alternativetuning&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alternativetuning@yahoo.com">alternativetuning@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: new notation program with microtones<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have not checked what happens for playback yet, but the graphics<br/>&gt; look good:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.turandot.hu/notation.htm">http://www.turandot.hu/notation.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gabor<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 20<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 07:09:31 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: finally ... webpage about monz&apos;s Solar System piece<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi Joe Pehrson, and anyone else who&apos;s interested,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; after only 3 years, i&apos;ve finally made a webpage about<br/>&gt; my Solar System piece ... which is *still* in only the<br/>&gt; most rudimentary form, compared to the wonderfully dynamic<br/>&gt; piece that i hope to eventually turn it into.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/solarsystem/solar-system.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/solarsystem/solar-system.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... and please be forewarned that this webpage was also<br/>&gt; a &quot;quickie&quot;, and i plan to make it much better in future<br/>&gt; updates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Joe, i singled you out because, of all those who have<br/>&gt; commented on this piece, you have been by far the most excited<br/>&gt; about it.  i figured you&apos;d want to bookmark this page.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 21<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 11:42:41 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;alternativetuning&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alternativetuning@yahoo.com">alternativetuning@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: finally ... webpage about monz&apos;s Solar System piece<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; hi Joe Pehrson, and anyone else who&apos;s interested,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; after only 3 years, i&apos;ve finally made a webpage about<br/>&gt; &gt; my Solar System piece ... which is *still* in only the<br/>&gt; &gt; most rudimentary form, compared to the wonderfully dynamic<br/>&gt; &gt; piece that i hope to eventually turn it into.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/solarsystem/solar-system.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/solarsystem/solar-system.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you know Laurie Spiegel&apos;s 1977  Kepler&apos;s &quot;Harmony Of The Planets&quot;<br/>&gt; (computer realization of Kepler treatise)?

Some of my support material is<br/>&gt; in a different location, but my memory should be okay.  (These are subject<br/>&gt; areas dear to my heart.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Re the Paul Poletti reasoning:  I don&apos;t think you can rely on his<br/>&gt; interpretation.  First off, Werckmeister never ever mentioned sixth comma meantone (let<br/>&gt; alone fifth comma).  All Werckmeister&apos;s work is based on quarter comma meantone<br/>&gt; (which is Werckmeister II tuning).  The fact that sixth comma works to mirror<br/>&gt; some of WIII is more of an after the fact that before the fact situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, Poletti is referring ot something that has been fully translated into<br/>&gt; English now, the directions for the harpsichord tuning attached to the 1698<br/>&gt; treatise on the Figured Bass treatise, and it smells more like ET than any<br/>&gt; meantone-derived tuning.  Poletti says the &quot;somewhat imprecise&quot; instructions are<br/>&gt; with little doubt  another &quot;meantone modification.&quot;  This is simply untrue,<br/>&gt; unless ET is considered in fact a meantone modification as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Besides, descriptions like &quot;primitive economy-class&quot; is too biased for me to<br/>&gt; take seriously.  I have performing Brandenburg Concerti in this &quot;primitive<br/>&gt; econmy class tuning&quot; of Werckmeister III to grand effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding some of your points:<br/>&gt; When I listed reasons for using a tuning other than the apparent modern sense<br/>&gt; of richness, I was being very general, not specific to either Werckmeister or<br/>&gt; Neidhardt.  And I can think of still more reasons.  Werckmeister III can be<br/>&gt; tuned in 15 minutes according to Werckmeister, and Bach was reputed to do<br/>&gt; likewise.  Neidhardt is likely more labor intensive, no?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But yes, ease and speed did not help ET.  And so we have the guild of piano<br/>&gt; tuners taking over.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As to Werckmeister and little boys...well, I&apos;d hate to sully his reputation,<br/>&gt; once again, based on moderns of a different Christian denomination.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, the story of Neidhardt and a Bach in competition of tunings at Jena<br/>&gt; is quite famous.  Look for it in the Mendel/David source material on J.S.<br/>&gt; Bach.  I only provided the info on who the Bach actually was.  Also, Neidhardt&apos;s<br/>&gt; first published tuning was ET, so any tuning duel as early as 1706 would likely<br/>&gt; be with this as his ammunition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [This message contained attachments]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 24<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 17:43:41 +0200<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Martin Braun&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:nombraun@telia.com">nombraun@telia.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: harmonic halves of the fourth<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If the 8/7 and 7/6 intervals are sung with as much deviations as is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; customary with &quot;our familiar minor seconds&quot;, the singers would lose<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the narrow bounds of harmonicity effects with these intervals most of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; what harmonicity effects? we&apos;re talking *horizontal* intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt; aren&apos;t we?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, of course. But we assume that also melodic (&quot;horizontal&quot;) intervals<br/>&gt; cause harmonicity effects in the brain, don&apos;t we? Why else should it be much<br/>&gt; easier to sing a fourth or a fifth than a tritone? Physiologically, we<br/>&gt; assume a &quot;reverberation&quot; of oscillating pitch detector neurons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, if a melodic 7/6 is attractive to a singer, it must be so because it<br/>&gt; causes harmonicity effects. But to reach these effects, the singer must hit<br/>&gt; the interval much more precisely than when hitting a melodic fourth (as seen<br/>&gt; in your &quot;entropy&quot; graphs). That&apos;s why 7/6 and 8/7 are more difficult to sing<br/>&gt; than 5/4 and 6/5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, as I said, it may be possible, and I would love to see some data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Martin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
