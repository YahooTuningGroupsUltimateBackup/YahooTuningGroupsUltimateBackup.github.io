Now the trick - what fretings<br/>&gt;to use?</p><p>Hi Bill et al.</p><p>I&apos;m still happily playing my 21TJI guitar (I&apos;m finishing up three new pieces<br/>that I hope to have soundfiles up for in the near future). Its clear that<br/>there is TONS of music to be played with this particular fretting and<br/>tuning, but I&apos;ve also been thinking about other setups-</p><p>My main other desire is to have a guitar in 12TJI in &quot;standard&quot;<br/>string-tuning. That way, I can use my 30 years of familiarity with that<br/>setup instead of starting from scratch again (in terms of where the notes<br/>are). I spend so much time improvising in E/e on my 12TET guitar that I<br/>would have no problem spending many happy hours playing in E/e on a JI<br/>guitar. Just something simple like 1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 ? 3/2 8/5 5/3<br/>(7/4 or 16/9? hmmm. probably 16/9) 15/8. so standard string-tuning would be<br/>1/1 4/3 (7/4 or 16/9) 6/5 3/2 1/1. Of course some frets would be partial to<br/>keep the scale consistent. A/a is another key I&apos;d like to have a fretboard<br/>for in JI in the same standard setup. I also improvise alot in various D<br/>scales using DADGBE tuning, so this would be another nice JI setup.</p><p>Another idea would be to use a scale from the harmonic series, maybe 16-32?<br/>You can also fret the neck to JI divisions and leave the string tuning<br/>variable- in fact isn&apos;t there a picture of a neck like this on Glen&apos;s site?<br/>I wonder what ratios he used?</p><p>If I ever win the lottery I&apos;m gonna get about 10 moveable-fret guitars. I<br/>think this is ideal so that you can explore different tunings without having<br/>to move the frets every time. I wonder about the removable fretboard thing.<br/>What kind of tolerances are possible, even with the best craftsmanship? (I&apos;m<br/>sure Glen&apos;s craftsmanship is on this level) I imagine it involves several<br/>different materials that have different reactions to heat/humidity over<br/>time, especially since they&apos;re not firmly attached to each other, so I<br/>wonder how this will effect the tuning accuracy?</p><p>On another note, the tuning list has many different conversations going on<br/>simultaneously. I dont understand why some people seem to be upset about<br/>electrons entering their computer that encode mathematical ideas! Maybe some<br/>who can&apos;t understand those postings feel intimidated or jealous, but thats<br/>their problem. I cant understand most of them, nor am I really interested in<br/>most ET issues but if I were to post someting along these lines I would be<br/>glad that others with the sophistication to understand it would read it and<br/>give feedback. If you&apos;re not interested, its just some people in another<br/>corner of the room talking about whatever interests them. Whats the big<br/>f%#$@&amp;* deal!?!  It doesn&apos;t stop anyone from posting whatever else they<br/>want, does it? Neil complained about theoretical posts before leaving but I<br/>didn&apos;t see him offering anything else. I guess maybe some people want others<br/>to do their conversing for them, but they want it the way &gt;they&lt; want it.<br/>Strikes me as a little petty and pathetic, but what do I know.</p><p>dante</p></div>
