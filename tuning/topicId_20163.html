It seems that, while<br/>I was gone, the FAQ writing, comment, and compilation processes went<br/>along just fine, thanks to the efforts of FAQ contributors and, of<br/>course, Robert Walker&apos;s intensive software work (thanks, Robert!).  So,<br/>where do we stand?  Are we in need of anyone to act as &quot;editor&quot;?</p><p>One laissez-faire sentiment that was expressed last week seems at odds<br/>with what I would consider an editor&apos;s duties: to correct spelling and<br/>grammatical errors where possible.  I do agree that the author should<br/>have final say in the precise sequence of characters, but are we such<br/>rugged individualists that we insist upon unorthodox spelling and usage,<br/>which might confuse some readers (especially those non-English speakers<br/>who must look up our words)?  I l&apos;v wackiness as much as the next guy,<br/>but feel a FAQ is not the best place to express it.</p><p>I agree with the idea that individual FAQ contributors should sign their<br/>work, unless anyone wants to be anonymous.  If we are willing, we can<br/>include our e-mail address, so that further questions can be sent<br/>directly to us, possibly resulting in a new, more clear FAQ revision<br/>later.</p><p>I like the idea of spanning a large range of questions from basic to<br/>esoteric.  Some of the questions already addressed might not be<br/>&quot;frequently asked&quot; by someone uninitiated in tuning or music history.<br/>But they&apos;re all issues that the contributor feels ought to be addressed,<br/>and I would favor wide latitude in that regard.</p><p>I think that each contribution should be posted to the list before being<br/>included (or possibly simultaneously).  Then, if others wish to offer<br/>comments, or additional contributions on the same subject, they can do<br/>so without fearing that something may have passed by without notice.<br/>So far, I think every contributor has been very receptive to comments<br/>and suggestions, and we&apos;ve had some questions answered by two or more<br/>people, which I think is good.</p><p>These thoughts are offered wearing the hat of a list member, and if<br/>nothing else is needed, I&apos;ll gladly &quot;abdicate&quot; any role in the FAQ<br/>preparation (beyond my own individual contribution(s)).  Or not,<br/>whichever.</p><p>Here&apos;s a call for more entries!  I&apos;m _certain_ that many list members<br/>are fantasizing about writing on one or more topics.  Let&apos;s all do it!<br/>Write it up; if you&apos;re not sure you want to submit it to the glare of<br/>the list, send it to me privately for comment.</p><p>Also please submit lists of additional questions you&apos;d like to see<br/>addressed.  I _know_ there&apos;s a lot of confusion out there, if other<br/>list members are half as confused as I am...</p><p>JdL</p></div>
