The comforts of<br/>&gt;temperaments await those that don&apos;t get this crucial point.</p><p>Jacky, I sympathize with your defense of JI against Jeff Harrington, and I&apos;d<br/>like to make a couple of points. First of all, 12-tET is a very recent<br/>development, having been &quot;standard&quot; for only 150 years. The history of<br/>Western music stretches back well over a millenium, encompassing many tuning<br/>systems, and strict (meaning vertical _and_ horizontal) 5-limit JI tuning,<br/>though presented over and over again in theory, was almost never a viable<br/>tuning basis of the music. We had Pythagorean through the early 15th<br/>century, a short period of schismatic pythagorean, meantone in the 16th-18th<br/>centuries (for which a Vicentino-like _adaptive_ JI system is musically<br/>viable but unwieldy for live musicians), and well-temperaments in the 18th<br/>and early 19th centuries. The music written in each of these periods<br/>depends, I think you&apos;d agree, on the particular logic of the tuning system<br/>that was informing composers&apos; imaginations at the time. These tuning systems<br/>were never mere &quot;convenient approximations&quot; to strict 5-limit JI -- each<br/>(besides Pythagorean) has a logic that, while making use of the same<br/>essential chordal structures as JI, connects them in a way that JI can&apos;t . .<br/>.</p><p>. . . so you&apos;re absolutely right, strict JI requires us to abandon our<br/>familiar ways of musical thought, the ones which informed the last millenium<br/>of Western music, and explore new ones, which may ultimately come to form<br/>one or more musical languages, perhaps alongside several others that other<br/>microtonal tunings will inform.</p></div><h3><a id=12832 href="#12832">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Those that find<br/>&gt;beatless or Just intervals more pleasing. I&apos;m wondering if you might<br/>&gt;know if this paper is available on the internet - or do you know how<br/>&gt;I may learn more about this?</p><p>This is a different issue -- in this study, subjects were given five<br/>different versions of 4:5:6 and 3:5:7 chords. The five versions had the<br/>middle note flat 30 cents, flat 15 cents, just, sharp 15 cents, and sharp 30<br/>cents. One group of listeners (the &quot;pure&quot; listeners) consistently preferred<br/>the just versions of each chord, while another group (the &quot;rich&quot; listeners)<br/>consistently preferred both of the 15-cent off versions of each chord. The<br/>results were rather different for a 10:12:15 chord. The study was published<br/>in a collection called _Harmony and Tonality_, proceedings of the Royal<br/>Swedish Academy of Music, J. Sundberg, ed. (I&apos;ve seen this in several<br/>libraries). What we&apos;re talking about here are much smaller mistunings -- in<br/>other words, let&apos;s proceed without considering, for now, the point of view<br/>of the &quot;rich&quot; listeners.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The traditional prohibition against parallel fifths and octaves in<br/>&gt;&gt; counterpoint is typically explained the same way -- the tones lose<br/>their<br/>&gt;&gt; independence, blending into a timbre, and the melody lines<br/>disappear.</p><p>&gt;Would it be incorrect to say that this may be more true of the lower<br/>&gt;number ratios, but when one makes choices from higher up the harmonic<br/>&gt;series - the same kinds of distictions may be obtained?</p><p>Absolutely -- harmonic entropy is precisely a measure of how well intervals<br/>(and chords, when I get to them) blend into a single timbre. And notice (if<br/>you haven&apos;t yet) how on the graphs, unisons (oh yeah, parallel unisons are<br/>prohibited too), fifths, and octaves have much lower harmonic entropy than<br/>other intervals within the octave.</p><p>&gt;Not to<br/>&gt;mention that the timbres one chooses will impact on this &quot;blending<br/>&gt;into a timbre&quot; effect (the context thing again). I personally have<br/>&gt;never seen this as a problem in my exploration of JI.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard likes to bring up this &quot;problem&quot; too. I think Jeff<br/>exaggerates it quite a bit, but I&apos;ve definitely noticed it, and feel that a<br/>tiny bit of mistuning (as occurs naturally in optimal meantones or John<br/>deLaubenfels&apos; adaptive-tuning renditions) gives the individual voices more<br/>&quot;buoyancy&quot; with respect to the harmonies. A bigger problem with perfectly<br/>exact (to, say, 0.05 cents) JI chords is that the indiviual tones, even if<br/>clearly audible as separate notes, have harmonic partials which are<br/>phase-locked with respect to one another. What that means is that coinciding<br/>partials will either interfere constructively, or destructively, or<br/>somewhere in-between, and that will never change as long as the chord is<br/>held. This is a very unnatural sound to me, and is never experienced outside<br/>of computer music, since real instruments will always be a tiny bit off JI<br/>no matter what. In the latter case, the coincident partials go through<br/>cycles of constructive and destructive interference, an effect which adds<br/>immensely to the &quot;realism&quot; of a computer rendition of music. When I hear the<br/>progressions of JI chords on Monz&apos;s Partch/Fox-Strangeways page, I can hear<br/>all the voices individually -- they don&apos;t blend into timbres -- but I&apos;m<br/>disturbed by the &quot;dead&quot; quality of the partials in these phase-locked,<br/>exact-JI chords. I prefer a tiny bit of mistuning, say on the order of a<br/>cent or so, to allow the partials to complete a significant portion of the<br/>constructive-destructive interference cycle during the time the chord is<br/>held, to avoid the very unnatural computer-JI sound of being locked at one<br/>point in this cycle.</p></div><h3><a id=12835 href="#12835">ðŸ”—</a>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2000 3:50:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

As you know, this is where I am coming<br/>from. And as an important part of good synthesis techniques, I&apos;m<br/>always concerned with creating &quot;organic&quot; sounding timbres to use in<br/>my JI pieces - and I almost always have this built into the timbres<br/>(both of the JI miniatures on the Tuning Lab have subtle pitch sifts<br/>built into the synth sounds - as well as the flute there is a 30<br/>second long sample of me playing the 1/1 of my wood flute). I enjoy<br/>synth timbres and or samples of real world instruments that do have<br/>this quality of very subtle pitch deviations - perhaps this is what<br/>satisfies my ears in the manner you speak of, about tuning away from<br/>Just. There is a huge difference in using a organ sound/static synth<br/>(as well as the ultra-cheese of general midi modules/sound cards -<br/>with their &quot;out of the box&quot; crappy sounds), and taking the time to<br/>develop evolving/breathing/living timbres for electronic music. You<br/>almost have got to have some ability to do electronic music sound<br/>design for your electronic music to have any integrity.

If he&apos;s hearing &quot;wrong note<br/>&gt; movement&quot; in JI, perhaps it could be due to jaded and burned out 12<br/>&gt; tET perceptions and preconceptions about tuning and music in general.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You know, it&apos;s just *so* important to make<br/>&gt; &gt; music compelling so that people will go and<br/>&gt; &gt; appreciate the theory behind it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, we&apos;re waiting to hear that compelling microtonal music you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; got - where may we find it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One concern I have about JI, though and this<br/>&gt; &gt; is probably the reason I&apos;m not that interested<br/>&gt; &gt; in it (yeah right) is that when these perfectly<br/>&gt; &gt; tuned chords resonate... uh... they stop<br/>&gt; &gt; being chords and form timbres. Now I kind<br/>&gt; &gt; of relish that effect, but nonetheless, if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; trying to write counterpoint and suddenly you<br/>&gt; &gt; resolve your suspension and freakin&apos; notes<br/>&gt; &gt; disappear into a timbre. Hey! What&apos;s up<br/>&gt; &gt; with that! That&apos;s just not good contrapuntal<br/>&gt; &gt; practice!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That he sees this as a detriment rather than a resource shows perfect<br/>&gt; naivety about JI as a tuning system. The rule is simple to<br/>&gt; understand - every conceivable tuning system under the Sun has it&apos;s<br/>&gt; own innate and latent potentials for musical generation, out of which<br/>&gt; an entire language of harmony and melody can be derived, and it is<br/>&gt; absurd to think that that any one of them should behave like the<br/>&gt; others do. In other words, one cannot come into the rich vocabulary<br/>&gt; of JI, with 12 tET ears - and all the preconceptions that accompany<br/>&gt; tempered musical thought and practice, and expect the musical system<br/>&gt; to behave in the old well worn familiar ways.

Frets corresponding<br/>to the 22 srutis of Indian music (in the usual JI interpretation)<br/>would be really nice, but I&apos;m uncertain how playable the upper<br/>members of comma pairs would be, particularly up high on the neck. I<br/>need to give this more thought.</p></div>
