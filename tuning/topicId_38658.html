The learning curve<br/>&gt; would be a little steeper than with the Bosanquet for 31, but 41<br/>&gt; would be better (compared to the Bosanquet), because everything is<br/>&gt; more easily reached.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The major scale would need to be learned only 4 times -- the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean and best-ratios-of-5 patterns for each hand would be<br/>&gt; unaltered in changing from 31 to 41 to 72.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the real problem is the economic curve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So dream on ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ____________</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=38685 href="#38685">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>7/17/2002 9:01:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:3D35082C.5058A008@anaphoria.com">3D35082C.5058A008@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;     There are a few Xenharmonikon articles that show that the Hanson<br/>&gt; keyboard pattern works for 72.

(BTW, you have my belated permission to post the<br/>material on your web site -- and thank you for doing so!)</p><p>As the article stated, the correct value was to be an interval that,<br/>when carried out to nineteen places, would generate a just 5:18<br/>(i.e., 5:9 increased by an octave).  I gave the revised value in<br/>cents as &quot;(1017.596288 + 1200)/19 = 116.7155941.

I take 31 or 41 tones<br/>as a<br/>&gt; &gt; series of secors, arrange them in order of pitch within an<br/>octave,<br/>&gt; &gt; and then treat them as if they were an ET and map that onto the<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard.  If you provide a sufficient number of duplicate keys,<br/>then<br/>&gt; &gt; the chain of secors can be picked up near the farther edge of the<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard wherever it begins to run off the nearer edge (and vice<br/>&gt; &gt; versa).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I thought you meant, yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is true that like patterns on the keyboard will not invariably<br/>&gt; &gt; produce the same intervals in tranposition.  However, if two<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals or chords in the subset are the same, then they can be<br/>&gt; &gt; played on the keyboard using the same interval pattern.  So I<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; call this transpositional uniformity but not transpositional<br/>&gt; &gt; invariance.  It&apos;s not the best of all possible worlds, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; better than anything the Halberstadt keyboard has to offer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose it&apos;ll work but it&apos;s not the way you&apos;d design a keyboard<br/>from<br/>&gt; scratch.</p><p>I agree with you completely.  The above would apply only if you<br/>already happened to have a Bosanquet keyboard or were planning to<br/>acquire one for other purposes.</p><p>&gt; And 11-limit chords that are simple on a decimal keyboard will<br/>&gt; be much harder to reach.</p><p>No question about it!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; You could fit something like that on a Bosanquet keyboard.  You<br/>may<br/>&gt; &gt; find<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it veers off the top or bottom because the upward drift is<br/>&gt; &gt; corrected every<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2/7 notes instead of every 10.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t like that.  It renders the color-coding of the Bosanquet<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard meaningless, not to mention the aches that might be<br/>caused<br/>&gt; &gt; by playing with the octaves going off on a diagonal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think MicroZones, which are the only commercially available<br/>Bosanquet<br/>&gt; keyboards, allow you to move the key tops to get different colour<br/>coding.</p><p>The same could be done with the generalized keyboard Scalatron keys.<br/>(However, on the Scalatron keyboard the octaves were hard-wired, so<br/>what you suggested would not have been possible.)</p><p>But considering how quickly the tuning can be changed, it would seem<br/>most inconvenient to have to go to the trouble of moving key tops<br/>around.  No matter how you do it, as you said, it would be much<br/>better to have the right keyboard in the first place.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But not Wilson&apos;s d&apos;Alessandro because some notes that should be<br/>&gt; &gt; distinct<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; map to the same key.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not familiar with that tuning.  (Until recently I was away<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; the microtonal scene for a couple of decades, and I still have<br/>some<br/>&gt; &gt; catching up to do.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s in Xenharmonikon.  As it&apos;s based around a Bosanquet layout, it<br/>isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really important for it to work in a different one.  But as there<br/>are so<br/>&gt; few historically significant 11-limit scales it is worth looking at.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve got my ZTar set up to play a decimal scale.

Oh, yes.  I split the keyboard into two zones and send them on two<br/>MIDI channels.  Then, the whole thing can be tuned in Kyma to a decimal<br/>layout.  The best way of splitting the keyboard is with 3 strings in each<br/>zone, so that most chords cover both.  Polyphony has to be allocated in<br/>advance for Kyma.  It might be better to have alternate strings on<br/>different channels.  I&apos;ve had a 7-limit/neutral third lattice tuned up as<br/>well I think.</p><p>For multitracking, I keep to one channel which means a few notes have to<br/>be missing.</p><p>The way it&apos;s usually set up is in guitar mode with a multiple-29 tuning.<br/>(I thought of calling this Mystery.  Is that taken?)  The fretting is to<br/>29-equal and the open strings are tuned in neutral thirds.</p><p>If you go to &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/tempered_lattice.htm">http://x31eq.com/tempered_lattice.htm</a>&gt; and search<br/>for &quot;Another simplification of the neutral-third lattice&quot;, it&apos;s really<br/>a version of that lattice.  So I should update the page to say it works<br/>with 58- as well as 31-equal.  Because I don&apos;t tune to exactly 58-equal,<br/>only half the chords are in tune.  But this isn&apos;t a problem so far as<br/>there are plenty of them.</p><p>I&apos;ve been playing with 8:11:13:16:22 chords.  The fingering&apos;s all in<br/>5-fret jumps, so I set up an alternative where the frets are to 5/29<br/>instead of 1/29.  It isn&apos;t as good melodically.  I haven&apos;t investigated<br/>the harmony, but it shows promise.  8:11:13 chords aren&apos;t wondrously<br/>consonant, but are non-arbitrary enough that they might make sense if they<br/>dominate.  Intervals with 5 and 7 can still be played, and they&apos;re no more<br/>difficult then 8:11:13 is with the usual setup.</p><p>With a real guitar, you should be able to get the best of both worlds<br/>because it isn&apos;t so difficult to stretch a whole tone, however many frets<br/>you&apos;re skipping.  I think a 29-equal fretting makes a lot of sense, and is<br/>worth considering alongside meantone and blackjack.  I&apos;ll have to do some<br/>serious work with it to see if it&apos;s really viable.  It looks a lot more<br/>complex than it feels, which may make it harder to fit real melodies and<br/>harmonies to it, instead of noodling.</p><p>As to the ZTar in general, I&apos;m getting on okay.  I had the week of work to<br/>receive it, and spent a few days of intensive work.  Then I switched to<br/>getting Stellar Floor Text done so I&apos;d have something to show for the time<br/>I spent.  I haven&apos;t given music so much attention since (STF still needs<br/>remixing) but I am finding I can play the ZTar more fluently.  It&apos;s<br/>getting easier to play the right hand key triggers.  To start off, I was<br/>very fast with the left hand, but there was a pause every time I changes<br/>strings.  I was expecting the new string to sound earlier.  With practice,<br/>you get over that like with any instrument.</p><p>I still think the key triggers are the weakest part of the instrument,<br/>though.  They don&apos;t always sound with a light touch, I still haven&apos;t<br/>worked out strumming, and because there solid it&apos;s not so easy to play<br/>expressively with them.  The aftertouch is good, but there&apos;s a small<br/>expressive range and for light touches the note retriggers.  I might<br/>switch to using two hands on the main keyboard, or expressing with the<br/>right hand using the pads, which are much better.  Treating the fretboard<br/>like a normal keyboard is a problem because the keys are so thin.  Perhaps<br/>that will also improve with practice.  A Mini-Z would be better if you&apos;re<br/>going to play like this a lot.</p><p>&gt; i&apos;m still convinced that the Ztar would give magnificent<br/>&gt; mappings of both the full 72edo and Canasta tunings.<br/>&gt; (see list archives from May 2001 for details.)</p><p>I&apos;ll see if I can simplify it to Canasta so that I get more octaves and<br/>some duplicated notes and it all fits in one channel.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
