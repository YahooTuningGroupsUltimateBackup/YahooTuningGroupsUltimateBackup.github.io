If we lived on the planet Antares in which all<br/>pitches came out in 12-tET, no matter what, would you still make music? I<br/>sure would, because I _love_ music. I love listening to music, I love<br/>playing music, and then after those, I love thinking about music. When I<br/>play, I don&apos;t think numbers or math, I hear the sound in my head first and<br/>then I produce it. As it happens, most of the sounds that come into my head<br/>are in a variety of &quot;languages&quot; that were all around me when I was growing<br/>up, and all these languages are pinned more or less to 12-tET. It&apos;s too late<br/>to change that now, and though I hope to be able to express myself fully in,<br/>say, 22-tET, I&apos;ve got too much to say that can&apos;t be said in 22-tET to just<br/>drop playing 12-tET music right now. For now, I can only hope to explore all<br/>these different avenues concurrently. I know I&apos;m on the right track -- I&apos;ve<br/>made people cry with my 22-tET music. But in case I never hit a moment of<br/>inspiration like that which created that piece again, I&apos;ll be glad for all<br/>the 12-tET abilities I&apos;ve acquired, as well as having contributed toward a<br/>movement toward exploring alternative tuning systems that may if fact lead<br/>to some culturally significant music in future generations.</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2000 3:48:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Paul H.
