I&apos;d like<br/>&gt;to see more on the mathematics of manipulating sets of<br/>&gt;exponents in a JI tuning system, similar to the way<br/>&gt;academic theorists use set-theory in 12-EDO.  Any ideas<br/>&gt;on this?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Lattice diagrams basically *are* set theory, for JI, no?<br/>I mean, it&apos;s trivial to map out a lattice of triads for an ET, since any<br/>set can happen on any note.  But in a JI system, where triads are (or some<br/>other sonority), is not trivial, cause they ain&apos;t everywhere.</p><p>I guess this is obvious.</p><p>Question:  What about latticing non-triads in JI?<br/>&#x9;1) is there a point? (i.e. the whole point of JI seems to be to be<br/>able to have vertical sonorities that are otonal/utonal, preferably lower<br/>on the series).</p><p>&#x9;2) has anyone fooled with the idea?</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=24302 href="#24302">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2001 10:50:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24271.html#24271">/tuning/topicId_24271.html#24271</a></p><p>&gt; Lattice diagrams basically *are* set theory, for JI, no?</p><p>Sounds right to me.
