The leader of the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet<br/>&gt;described it nicely:  He said that listening to minimalist music is<br/>&gt;somewhat like watching a fire in a fire place.</p><p>That is a great description, and I like watching fires (maybe more than<br/>listening to minimalist music :~).  The LA Guitar Quartet is cool!  I have<br/>Evening in Granada, on which they play Ian Krouse&apos;s &quot;Folias&quot;, which is the<br/>bomb!  This album is not minimalist, but highly recommended.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
