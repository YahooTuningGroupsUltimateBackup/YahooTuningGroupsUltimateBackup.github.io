I&apos;d be interested though in what happened<br/>tuning wise as the Moorish oud became the lute.</p><p>&gt; Various theorists discuss this, starting by around 1545, for example<br/>&gt; Vicentino, Zarlino, and Vincenzo Galilei. In 1567, the year of Queen<br/>&gt; Mary&apos;s forced abdication while in captivity at Lochleven (24 July), an<br/>&gt; Italian composer named Gorzanis published a collection of 48 dances, two<br/>&gt; with each of the 12 notes of the chromatic lute gamut as a modal final.</p><p>Are these pieces online anywhere? I remember downloading some very good tablatures from<br/><a href="http://medieval.org">medieval.org</a></p><p>&gt; Writing around 1600, Giovanni Maria Artusi takes this equivalence as<br/>&gt; natural on the lute, and considers it &quot;older than the cuckoo<br/>&gt; birds,&quot; although Mark Lindley concludes that the widespread<br/>&gt; &quot;standardization&quot; of 12-tET may have occurred around 1550, during Mary&apos;s<br/>&gt; childhood in France in terms of your performance situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your mention of Milan, however, is an illustration of another of Lindley&apos;s<br/>&gt; points -- that 12-tET was not a _universal_ standard throughout the 16th<br/>&gt; century, especially the earlier part. Specifically, he recommends a<br/>&gt; meantone interpretation for some compositions by Milan dating to around<br/>&gt; the 1530&apos;s. He _likes_ the beating of meantone fifths, and finds that it<br/>&gt; gives the music a &quot;warm&quot; quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is discussed in his book, entitled something like _Lutes, Viols, and<br/>&gt; Temperaments_.</p><p>Yes, thanks Margo. I asked about this before. It&apos;s about time I actually read it because the<br/>largest part of my repertoire is of the Spanish &quot;vihuelistas&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Thus judging by what Zarlino and Vicentino say in the 1550&apos;s, I might<br/>&gt; guess that David Rizzio, at least, might have used equal semitones (or a<br/>&gt; close approximation) on his lute.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since so much of Queen Mary&apos;s cultural background was shaped in France,<br/>&gt; one might want to investigate the literature there, to see if lute<br/>&gt; intonation was discussed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, while as people have mentioned, there were various tuning schemes<br/>&gt; for lute, 12-tET seems to be the &quot;standard&quot; lute temperament of the later<br/>&gt; 16th century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I might add that there were &quot;alternative fretters&quot; back then, too: Galilei<br/>&gt; describes how they would add _tastini_ or extra &quot;little frets&quot; for purer<br/>&gt; thirds, and complains that this is outside the proper diatonic and<br/>&gt; chromatic genera, and also that in practice the sensitivity of these<br/>&gt; people&apos;s ears can be judged by the number of &quot;imperfect&quot; (i.e. Wolf)<br/>&gt; fifths they play in navigating those extra frets.</p><p>That&apos;s a possibility - gluing small body frets for purer (or further out) thirds.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, this is a quick summary. One reason that 12-tET may have been not<br/>&gt; to hard to approximate is that the &quot;18 rule&quot; -- fretting with semitones of<br/>&gt; 18:17 -- happens to get an assist from the physics of the actual fretting<br/>&gt; so that it can be more accurate than the &quot;correct&quot; logarithmic fretting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>Excellent information.
