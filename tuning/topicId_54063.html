I&apos;ve been busy<br/>and recently back from St. Petersburg, Russia, where a performance<br/>of my _One Small Step for Man_ in eighth tones was excellently<br/>performed.  We used the version that Johnny Reinhard edited (he made<br/>some great musical changes, which I used, naturally).</p><p>Also, two of my electronic works in alternate tunings were<br/>performed, _Beepy_ in the Bohlen-Piercy scale and _Blacklight_, in<br/>the Blackjack scale.  My wife did a choreographed solo to those<br/>which added greatly (nothing worse than the &quot;olden days&quot; black<br/>theatre for electronic music!)</p><p>I&apos;ve also been going over lots of music that I brought back for<br/>almost no money.  A good sized ensemble piece by a Russian composer<br/>published by the &quot;Kompositor&quot; publishing house there costs only a<br/>little over a dollar!</p><p>Yes, and there were some microtonal materials, too, including a<br/>score for two pianos in quarter-tones and a theoretical work by<br/>Wyschnegradsky.  This I may be lending to Johnny Reinhard, if he<br/>wants to have some of it translated.  The diagrams are great.</p><p>Hoping to get back into the &quot;swing of things&quot; on this list soon...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
