The shruti-s would be<br/>&gt;equidistant.</p><p>That&apos;s not perceptually equidistant. We hear logarthmically. At 22 Hz, an<br/>increment of 1 Hz is a small semitone. At 440 Hz, the increment of 1 Hz<br/>becomes melodically imperceptible. In higher and higher ranges, 1 Hz means<br/>less and less.</p><p>Dividing the span from 22 Hz to 44 Hz in 1 Hz increments would result in an<br/>otonal scale that happens to be very far from the Indian scale. As you<br/>showed, Ga is almost as high as the usual Ma and Pa becomes a komal Dha.<br/>Meanwhile, dividing the span from 22 Hz to 44 Hz using equally-spaced frets<br/>on a string instrument or equally-spaced holes on a wind instrument can<br/>result in a utonal scale, also very far from the Indian scale, but in the<br/>opposite direction.</p><p>A perceptually equal division would be 22-tone equal temperamen, leading to<br/>a scale much closer, though still noticeably different, from the Indian<br/>scale.</p><p>22-tET quantization of sa-grama:</p><p>Sa   Re   Ga   Ma   Pa   Dha   Ni   Sa<br/>   4    3    2    4    4     3    2</p><p>0   218   384  491  709  927  1091  1200</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t use this, but it&apos;s still a lot closer than either the otonal or<br/>the utonal versions.</p><p>&gt;We CANNOT accommodate 22 shruti-s in an octave, if the scale starts<br/>&gt;below 22 Hz.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>&gt;Is this some kind of limit?  Is this the reason why the human ear<br/>&gt;cannot hear below 22 Hz?</p><p>Yes -- that&apos;s just the physiology of the ear. You can _feel_ frequencies<br/>below that, of course -- but they won&apos;t be perceived as having _pitch_.</p></div><h3><a id=21028 href="#21028">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2001 12:49:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Haresh,</p><p>I&apos;ve tried listening to your scales at 22-44 Hz.</p><p>Used the ocarina voice in midi as a sine wave approximation.</p><p>I think if one could play only the note itself, then I prob. wouldn&apos;t be able to distinguish<br/>the 44-tet notes.
