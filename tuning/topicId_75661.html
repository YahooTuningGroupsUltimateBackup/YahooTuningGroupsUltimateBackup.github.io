I had to play on it all the time on the practice-room and teaching harpsichords, at a school where the tuning was done by other people.  It was their job.  We weren&apos;t allowed to, or encouraged to, go changing it ourselves.  During that same period I purchased my virginal, got it into playing shape, and tuned it myself however I wanted to...which was not WIII.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve done WIII many times since then, mostly to remind myself of the intonation scheme and its odd motion that was so familiar from grad school (especially the weird melodic sounds from the notes Ab, Db, and Gb)...but that&apos;s only for private study at home.</p><p>I used it a little bit before that grad school sojourn too, experimentally.  But way back then I much preferred Young 2 and Kirnberger 3, whenever I wasn&apos;t playing in some regular meantone or other.  I have *never* preferred WIII in any serious situation where I had a choice for a public performance, and where I was in charge of the tuning myself.  It&apos;s just so ugly overall, plus if there are violinists it creates the silly problem of having A-E pure while the other open string relationships are heavily tempered (if those players have any inclination to try to match the harpsichord).</p><p>=====</p><p>And Johnny quipped:<br/>&gt;     Johnny: Value judgment. That&apos;s it. You call crappy what makes<br/>&gt; 31-tone equal temperament so beautiful.</p><p>No, Johnny.  Apparently you don&apos;t get my point.  My main objection to WIII is not primarily to the 1/4 comma 5ths.  It&apos;s to the Pythagorean ditones that WIII puts forth in place of decent major 3rds, and to the way the temperament *as a whole* makes music in flats sound ugly and misshapen.  31TET doesn&apos;t have Pythagorean ditones in it masquerading as major 3rds.  The point of those multiple-division systems is to play correctly-spelled notes, not enharmonic substitutions of the type that WIII serves up badly for notes such as Ab, Db, Gb, A#, E#, and B#.</p><p>Let&apos;s take a look at WIII and Young 2 side by side.  Starting from C and going around the flat side, they&apos;re the same all the way around to Gb. But going around the sharp side, Young 2 is smoothly averaged out and suave from each 5th/4th to the next, while WIII is simply lumpy.  WIII is like Young 2 done badly.  The G, D, and A all sag progressively flat, and then the pure A-E-B makes it sort of catch up and overshoot, and then the leftover B-F# is tighter than it would have needed to be.  Ugh.   All that unevenness for the questionable goals of delivering a barely-sharp C-E and F-A, at the expense of so much else?</p><p>Furthermore: to play WIII on a piano, or to listen to somebody else playing in WIII on a piano, says almost nothing useful about the way it sounds on harpsichord.  JP&apos;s performance of the Bach F major Duetto may have seemed just fine to you on piano, as you&apos;ve asserted several times, but get your hands on a real harpsichord and play it yourself...if you want to hear how bad WIII really sounds on a harpsichord.  Please!  Go through it interval by interval.  That middle section is excruciating, both melodically and harmonically, and the two-voiced texture makes the problems stand out with bold relief.  The composition (which Bach *published* in 1739, in a book done at his own expense) makes WIII and any regular meantones sound like brutishly incompetent temperaments to play his modern music.  So does the E minor Duetto, with its lightning-fast enharmonic swaps.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2008 7:45:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  My main objection to<br/>&gt; WIII is not primarily to the 1/4 comma 5ths.

Part of it is the tone structure of the<br/>modern piano, which is often noticeably inharmonic, especially in the<br/>bass and tenor, which is the basis for the harmonic identity of any<br/>keyboard. Another aspect for me is that I simply don&apos;t like literature<br/>not written for the modern (post 1870) cross-strung piano on the<br/>modern cross-strung piano. I have the same aversion to Flamenco played<br/>on the piano, as a number of &quot;crossover&quot; players try to do here.<br/>Flamenco guitar is traditionally fast, rapid, and incredibly<br/>articulate, and when you try to do that on modern piano, it&apos;s such a<br/>truck that the notes just come out sounding like abortions, cut down<br/>before they even begin to live. Granted, it&apos;s no so marked with Bach.<br/>But I suppose my biggest gripe is simply, &quot;why do it?&quot; As if we don&apos;t<br/>have any REAL Baroque instruments these days? I just don&apos;t get it...</p><p> JP&apos;s performance of the Bach F major Duetto may<br/>&gt; have seemed just fine to you on piano, as you&apos;ve asserted several<br/>times,<br/>&gt; but get your hands on a real harpsichord and play it yourself...if you<br/>&gt; want to hear how bad WIII really sounds on a harpsichord.</p><p>Right!!!!

As far as the aversion that<br/>Brad feels, there are some  similarities, and yet not.</p><p>Because I worked so much on the Mozart Bassoon  Concerto K191 I began to hate<br/>the piece.  Even now I have to get over old  negative feelings.  Many<br/>orchestral musicians bad viscerally about  Beethoven&apos;s Fifth Symphony, almost a<br/>hatred.  I&apos;m not keen on Wagner  because I can&apos;t totally divorce the man from the<br/>music.  (Stunned the  NYPhil played Wagner as a first piece in Pyongyang, but<br/>hey.)</p><p>But Brad, this is a microtonal list in that we  recognize many different<br/>tunings.  My being a polymicrotonalist makes it  hard for me to imagine being<br/>nauseous about a particular interval of any  stripe.  I do believe you feel this<br/>way.  In some ways it makes sense  that you were so vehement in stating you<br/>found Bach&apos;s tuning.  You hated  the alternative I have been presenting.</p><p>Honestly, I love the tuning as used for Bach and  some others (Mozart, Krebs,<br/>Buxtehude).  There is nothing wrong with me nor  a large audience<br/>internationally that does like Werckmeister III for Bach (e.g.,  Koopman, Wolff,<br/>Pechefsky).</p><p>Ditones were used successfully for centuries, and  tastes changes.  I love<br/>the ditone melodically.  If we were to find  that Bach misued the ditones in<br/>Werckmeister III I would certainly have cause to  change my tune.  I just think<br/>the composer knew what his intervallic  vocabulary in advance.  Your modern<br/>distress, as real as it is, cannot  influence an honest appraisal of the goings<br/>on in the early 18th century.   I would think you could agree to that.</p><p>PP: Actually, I think all that is ugly about WIII comes more  from his<br/>desire to come up with a cheap-o retuning of a 1/4 meantone  organ.<br/>Which is why he stuck to those extremely-tempered fifths. What  he<br/>ended up with is the worst of both worlds: very narrow fifths  without<br/>any pure thirds. Oh boy!</p><p>JR:  This is bullkrap.  Werckmeister was a pioneer,  the first to put down<br/>and promote a circle.  Criticizing him as you did  Kirnberger is plain wrong.<br/>It is bullying those who are defenseless and  the basis is false because you<br/>are looking for the present backwards.  In  reality it was the latest of what<br/>had preceded it, likely causing in part a sea  change in music making.</p><p>While Brad does not mind the flatted fifths as much as he  bemoans the<br/>ditones, Paul, like Werckmeister in 1698 complains about the &quot;lame&quot;  fifths.  Bach<br/>must be stupid in Paul&apos;s estimation because he insisted all  major thirds must<br/>be sharp of just.  There is nothing &quot;cheap&quot; in pioneering  work; it is<br/>something to respect.</p><p>&gt; Furthermore: to play WIII on a piano, or to listen  to somebody else<br/>&gt; playing in WIII on a piano, says almost nothing useful  about the way it<br/>&gt; sounds on harpsichord.</p><p>Brad:  JP&apos;s performance of the Bach F major Duetto  may<br/>&gt; have seemed just fine to you on piano, as you&apos;ve asserted  several<br/>times,<br/>&gt; but get your hands on a real harpsichord and play it  yourself...if you<br/>&gt; want to hear how bad WIII really sounds on a  harpsichord.</p><p>Paul:  Right!!!!

My  group and I have been using<br/>harpsichord for Bach and other early composer for  many years.  It is ignorant<br/>for you to develop amnesia all of a sudden,  Paul.  Check out our CDs.  We<br/>used harpsichord in Terry Riley&apos;s In C  in Just Intonation.</p><p>However, I do have a great pianist who not only wants to  play Bach on piano,<br/>but who dislikes harpsichord.  Many people do.   You may have noticed the<br/>instrument kind of disappeared from history until  fairly recently.   But don&apos;t<br/>jump to any conclusions, I love the  instrument when it is a good instrument,<br/>in the right balance with others  playing, insightfully played, in a beautiful<br/>experience.     The piano on the Duetto is only a recent example of my<br/>throwing a bone to a  great player.</p><p>Lo and behold, I have no problems with  WIII.  At least as regards Bach or<br/>Buxtehude, it sounds fantastic to  equal temperament.  It would sound better in<br/>anything circular tuning  compared to equal temperament if only because of it<br/>variety, which I would  love.  Others have loved the variety of intervals<br/>(e.g., Forkel,  Kirnberger, Werckmeister).</p><p>Paul, I have asked you for responses and you haven&apos;t given  them.  If there<br/>is a recording of St. Matthew&apos;s Passion outside of ET,  I would do anything to<br/>get it.  If there is a European concert featuring  the piece, I would try to<br/>make an international trip.</p><p>Johnny</p><p>**************It&apos;s Tax Time!

What are we to make of this:</p><p>&quot;Zarlino in 1588 attributed the following prophetic arguments to<br/>Girolamo Roselli, abbot of S Martino delle Scale in Sicily:</p><p>    This way of dividing the diapason or octave into 12 equal parts <br/>could alleviate all the difficulties of singers, players and composers<br/>by enabling them generally  to sing or play  DOREMIFASOLLA upon<br/>whichever of the 12 notes they wish, touring through all the notes,<br/>making, as he [Roselli] says, a circular music; hence all the<br/>instruments will be able to keep their tuning and be in unison, and<br/>organs, as he says, will be neither too high nor too low in pitch.&quot;<br/>[from Grove article on temperament, mostly by Lindley]</p><p>ET being, of course, the ultimate &quot;circle&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Criticizing him as you did  Kirnberger is plain wrong.</p><p>Ah, did I do that? I actually think W. was a pretty sharp dude who had<br/>his head screwed on right. I understand completely his logic of &quot;WIII&quot;<br/>if you want to crow-bar a very basic circulating system onto a 1/4<br/>meantone organ, as he said he did. I also understand why this Russian<br/>nuclear bomb (crude but effective) temperament is NOT what he<br/>recommends for continuo, because it is just too musically limited for<br/>the realistic demands of the continuo player, at least as I understand<br/>it from reading various writers of the time.</p><p>It&apos;s not W himself I fault, it&apos;s his First Real Temperament, and only<br/>that when modern players try to elevate it to some mythical status it<br/>never had. Kirnberger, on the other hand, I don&apos;t think much of as a<br/>temperament theorist.</p><p>&gt; It is bullying those who are defenseless and  the basis is false<br/>because you<br/>&gt; are looking for the present backwards.</p><p>I like to think not, since I first learned to tune meantone, and after<br/>reveling in it for a year or so (Fitzwilliam, Lady Nevel, Italian<br/>stuff, etc), started investigating the so called &quot;well&quot; temperaments.</p><p>But then, you are absolutely right in that we</p><p>&gt; are looking for the present backwards.</p><p>...including you. So that&apos;s a difference without a distinction. Or is<br/>it a distinction without a difference? I never can remember which is<br/>which.</p><p>&gt; In  reality it was the latest of what<br/>&gt; had preceded it, likely causing in part a sea  change in music making.</p><p>I doubt that. Generally, the temperament theory follows temperament<br/>practice, and practice follows necessity. As the old saw goes,<br/>necessity is the mother of invention. I think your gonna have a pretty<br/>hard row to hoe convincing anyone that WIII caused any sort of<br/>dramatic change in Baroque music making.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While Brad does not mind the flatted fifths as much as he  bemoans the<br/>&gt; ditones, Paul, like Werckmeister in 1698 complains about the &quot;lame&quot;<br/> fifths.</p><p>You&apos;re only half right. I don&apos;t mind exceptionally narrow fifths if<br/>they give you somethig nice in return, like the pure thirds in regular<br/>or mdofied meantone. You just quoted me, can&apos;t you remember what I wrote?</p><p>&gt;  Bach<br/>&gt; must be stupid in Paul&apos;s estimation because he insisted all  major<br/>thirds must<br/>&gt; be sharp of just.</p><p>How does that follow? Did Bach say, &quot;You must get these wide thirds by<br/>having a small number of really narrow fifths&quot;? Nope, don&apos;t think so.<br/>Of course the thirds must be wide of pure. Otherwise it&apos;s not<br/>circulating. So what? There are so many possibilities that fulfill<br/>that prescription that mentioning it is pointless.</p><p>&gt; There is nothing &quot;cheap&quot; in pioneering  work; it is<br/>&gt; something to respect.</p><p>Don&apos;t go spin-doctoring what I said, Johnny. I said &quot;cheap&quot; in terms<br/>of &quot;low cost&quot;, and in regards to the expense of the process of<br/>retuning the organ, and I&apos;ve made myself clear on that several times.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  Right!!!!

It<br/>is ignorant<br/>&gt; for you to develop amnesia all of a sudden,  Paul.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the two are related, Johnny. Ignorance is a state of<br/>intellectual innocence, a state which exists prior to learning.<br/>Amnesia is a loss of that which has been learned. One can be ignorant<br/>of the facts, but one cannot be ignorant to do anything.</p><p>I do plead guilty to being ignorant of the existence of &quot;your group&quot;.<br/>What&apos;s it called? What CD&apos;s of Bach and other Baroque music have you<br/>guys done?</p><p>But I was just responding to the praise of some performance of Bach on<br/>the piano.</p><p>&gt; Check out our CDs.  We<br/>&gt; used harpsichord in Terry Riley&apos;s In C  in Just Intonation.</p><p>A yes. Good freind of Bach, Terry Riley. But Riley...that&apos;s Early<br/>English Baroque, isn&apos;t it? How do we know there is any relevance with<br/>High German Baroque?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I do have a great pianist who not only wants to  play Bach<br/>on piano,<br/>&gt; but who dislikes harpsichord.  Many people do.</p><p>I&apos;m one of them. The only thing worse than a solo harpsi concert is<br/>harpsi and recorder.</p><p>&gt; You may have noticed the<br/>&gt; instrument kind of disappeared from history until  fairly recently.</p><p>Yes, of course, everybody knows of the Great Harpsichord Riots which<br/>swept Europe in the late 18th century, when droves of dissatisfied<br/>concert goers finally reached the breaking point and went from house<br/>to house, hauling out the infernal plucking machines, and casting them<br/>on huge bonfires, eventually culminating in the Council of Kontich, in<br/>which it was agreed that the instrument would be banned forever more<br/>and a new replacement should be invented forthwith. Where it not for<br/>the brave souls of the mid 20th century, who gave their liberty, and<br/>yes, at times, even their very lives to fight for the repeal of<br/>antiquated laws forbidding the manufacture, sale, and posession of any<br/>mechanical device for the plucking of musical strings, we would not be<br/>able to experience the suffering of listeners of times long past, nor<br/>would we be able to fully appreciate how lucky we are to have the<br/>choice of a superior modern instrument.</p><p>&gt; Lo and behold, I have no problems with  WIII.  At least as regards<br/>Bach or<br/>&gt; Buxtehude, it sounds fantastic to  equal temperament.</p><p>Just about ANY historic temperament sounds more interesting that ET.</p><p>&gt; It would sound better in<br/>&gt; anything circular tuning  compared to equal temperament if only<br/>because of it<br/>&gt; variety, which I would  love.  Others have loved the variety of<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; (e.g., Forkel,  Kirnberger, Werckmeister).</p><p>Nobody is arguing against that, we just don&apos;t think WIII is all you<br/>want to crack it up to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul, I have asked you for responses and you haven&apos;t given  them.<br/>If there<br/>&gt; is a recording of St. Matthew&apos;s Passion outside of ET,  I would do<br/>anything to<br/>&gt; get it.</p><p>  If there is a European concert featuring  the piece, I would try to<br/>&gt; make an international trip.</p><p>Then drop everything, grab you coat and hat, and run don&apos;t walk to the<br/>airport, my good man! There are still tickets for some of the concerts<br/>of the NVB yearly tour/performance of same.

Don&apos;t know what temperament they are using this year, cuase<br/>I&apos;m not doing so much with them anymore after moving to Spain; but I<br/>can assure you it will NOT be equal. Probably a Neidhardt, which all<br/>the players were really happy with last bunch of times I tuned for them.</p><p>they also have a CD of it for sale. Don&apos;t know what temperament it is<br/>&apos;cause it was recorded back in &apos;97, just before I started tuning for<br/>them  a lot. But again, I&apos;d bet my bottom guilder it ain&apos;t equal. I&apos;d<br/>be real surprised if the Collegium Vocale recording is equal as well.</p><p>Happy Trails,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2008 7:24:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny asserted:<br/>&gt;     Ditones were used successfully for centuries, and tastes changes.

Allot 15 minutes to set WIII onto an 8-foot register of strings, and the other 45 minutes to play through Bach&apos;s four Duetti several times each, listening closely to the intervals and the way they interact.  Do the ditones of WIII make a plausible (let alone beautiful) musical effect, playing these pieces on a harpsichord (NOT A PIANO), with the intervals exposed as nakedly as these compositions give them?</p><p>&gt;     Johnny: You guys are just plain ignorant. My group and I have been<br/>&gt;     using<br/>&gt;     harpsichord for Bach and other early composer for many years. It is<br/>&gt;     ignorant<br/>&gt;     for you to develop amnesia all of a sudden, Paul. Check out our CDs.

The piano on the Duetto is only a recent example of my<br/>&gt;     throwing a bone to a great player.</p><p>Ummm...it&apos;s nice to see public approval, albeit such grudging and patronizing approval, of an instrument that I&apos;ve been playing for 25 years and chose to earn a doctorate in.  Having done so, I feel that I have some qualification and experience in proposing the above one-hour test with the Bach Duetti, to demonstrate to you in your own hands and<br/>ears that Werckmeister III doesn&apos;t really work very well for that music.</p><p>I even have two recordings of other harpsichordists -- Rousset and Cates -- who did use WIII for those Duetti.  I respect their decisions (or their producers&apos; or tuners&apos; decisions...) to have done so, years ago when they did, although I don&apos;t much fancy the sound of the results. Their playing is more than good enough to distract me away from some of the intonational problems of the setup.</p><p>But again, the test is not in recordings or in listening to anybody&apos;s opinion on the Internet; it is in going through the pieces oneself hands-on, at a real harpsichord freshly tuned in WIII, at various tempos, to hear directly what it sounds like.  Would Bach really have tolerated or preferred this next to alternatives?  Set aside your foregone conclusion, for the moment, and listen honestly to the music playing it yourself on a decent harpsichord, an instrument Bach himself was an expert at playing and tuning.  Assuming (as we must) that Bach didn&apos;t have cloth ears, and that he really was a good and sensitive composer, can you as a sensitive musician honestly continue in the belief that Bach would have *preferred* WIII there?  Would Bach harness himself knowingly and deliberately to such a system, and use it as inspiration to write these particular pieces?  Why?  I agree with your idea above that Bach &quot;knew his intervallic vocabulary in advance&quot;; but I don&apos;t think it likely that that vocabulary stemmed from WIII on harpsichords.  Don&apos;t hear it from me.  Hear it from Bach&apos;s own music.</p><p>And if you can&apos;t bring yourself to try that particular one-hour test in the Duetti, well then, pick some other test.  (But I&apos;m telling you in good faith that the Duetti will give you about the best and most obvious one-hour test available, working hands-on at a real harpsichord.)  I&apos;ve suggested a month&apos;s worth of them here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html</a><br/>And I *have* gone through all of those myself, playing variously in WIII and other temperaments of its similar shape, to hear what they really do in interaction with Bach&apos;s extant music.  If you&apos;re serious about putting WIII forth as not only something Bach tolerated but that he actually somehow preferred, please test it like that in the music.  Does the music really sound optimal, tuned in that way?</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
