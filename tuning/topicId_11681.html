I particular, I have been having a lot of fun with<br/>the Centaur tuning described at Anaphoria (<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html">www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html</a>).<br/>It has a lot of interesting resources and I find manageable for a<br/>beginner to start with.  I find the collection of major, minor and<br/>septimal minor triads particularly intriguing.</p><p>        While playing around with this tuning I noticed that I was<br/>doing something that should have made my toes curl, at least by all<br/>reports: I was playing this as a chord: 9/8 7/5 5/3.  This looks like<br/>DF#A using the mapping from the web page.  My fingers were thinking<br/>&quot;major.&quot;  Overtone series: 84:100:135.  The interval from 9/8 to 5/3<br/>is the much maligned wolf fifth, 40:27.  The 40:27 interval sounded<br/>like a fine member of the Major family to me combined with the 7/5,<br/>though the beating from just the 40:27 is not quite nice.</p><p>        Now this is no surprise that the addition of the 7/5 would<br/>improve the overall sensation of consonance, I thought, until I<br/>checked the intervocalic ratios: 56:45, 25:21.  Now, 25:21 is only two<br/>cents off (301.85) a tempered minor third, but 56:45 is well away from<br/>anything at 378.6 cents (5/4 is 386.31).  I&apos;ve checked the tuning of<br/>the synth several times in desperation.</p><p>        Why in the world didn&apos;t this chord shriek at me?</p><p>        I don&apos;t have an answer to that.  I listen to a lot of<br/>obnoxious electronic music with a fondness for fairly brilliant - not<br/>to say discordant - timbres, which may have left me with an<br/>appreciation, somehow, for a chord like 84:100:135.  However, I did<br/>start to wonder about ways of characterizing a chords &quot;distance&quot; from<br/>some other chord, such that one can say &quot;nope, these are too far apart<br/>to be misconstrued for each other?&quot;  I grabbed &quot;Divisions of the<br/>Tetrachord&quot; and read through chapter 5 a few times.  There are lots of<br/>interesting tables there, but I&apos;m not quite sure comparing tetrachords<br/>and comparing chords are the same thing.  Has anyone done any work on<br/>this?  I&apos;d rather not rediscover work already done. :)</p><p>* Reaktor.  At the risk of sounding like a marketing person for<br/><a href="http://www.native-instruments.de">www.native-instruments.de</a>, I must say that Reaktor is one of the most<br/>wonderful software synthesizers I have ever seen.  It is in fact a<br/>system for *building* synths and samplers.  This flexibility has<br/>allowed me to add a bunch of retuning knobs to every &quot;ensemble&quot; (a<br/>working collection of sound modules) I find I like.  It makes playing<br/>with tuning a joy, though my neighbors may not agree. :)</p><p>--<br/>William S.
