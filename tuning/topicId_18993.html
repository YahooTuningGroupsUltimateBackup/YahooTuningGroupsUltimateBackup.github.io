The largest, kendang ageng or kendang<br/>gendhing, and smallest, kendang ketipung, are usually played together in the<br/>least dense irama (= temporal density level), while the medium sized drum,<br/>kendang ciblon or batangan (or, in my case, a slightly larger kendang wayangan)<br/>is used for the more dense, lively irama. The drums are tuned to specific tones,<br/>with the kendang agengs two heads roughly a fifth apart.</p><p>--- I agree that position, mallet type, and attack method are important to the<br/>timbre, and in my experience the commercially available samples of Indonesian<br/>instruments have been almost all misplayed, to the point where they are not<br/>useable for anything resembling the original style. Caveat emptor!</p><p>--- The boss, or _pencon_ is the raised knob in the center of a gong that is<br/>struck and plays an important role in determining the apparent pitch of the<br/>gong. Some people refer to the boss as an impeller, which is an apt description<br/>of its function on the surface of what otherwise is a metal membranophone. Sam<br/>Quigley does indeed have a web site, with articles on gongsmithing and his<br/>pencon project. <a href="http://www3.shore.net/~samq/">http://www3.shore.net/~samq/</a></p><p>I&apos;ve been engaged in Javanese music as a player, not especially as a composer,<br/>so a cd is still a long way off.
