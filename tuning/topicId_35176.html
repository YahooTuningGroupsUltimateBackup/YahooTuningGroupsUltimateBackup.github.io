I would think doing better would be very<br/>&gt;hard.</p><p>I&apos;m still not clear on what you guys are discussing.  The<br/>required accuracy is wildly different in different situations.<br/>The situation requiring the most accuracy that I am aware of<br/>is the tuning of very fine pianos.  It has been shown to my<br/>satisfaction that piano tuners make adjustments as fine as<br/>+- 0.1 or maybe even 0.05 cents.  At least, I have it from the<br/>fellow who makes Sanderson Accutuners that such accuracy is<br/>needed.  Such differences are inaudible except in the beating<br/>of high harmonics when multiple strings are sounded together.<br/>Adjustments at this scale are heard as a change in the _timbre_<br/>of the instrument to most listeners (who can hear it at all).<br/>And importantly, such adjustments may NOT necessarily be in<br/>the direction of JI (or equivalently, defining the fundamental<br/>of the pitches being tuned to this degree of accuracy is<br/>somewhat arbitrary).</p><p>Another situation needing this accuracy may be the use of<br/>electronic timbres for particular effects such as beat-counting<br/>in extended-duration music (see recent mention of LaMonte<br/>Young&apos;s installations on this list).</p><p>For ensembles of free-pitched monophonic instruments, the<br/>most accurate examples I know of are brass quintets playing<br/>5-limit music, maybe to +- 0.5 cents for sustained chords<br/>in optimum voicings.  Barbershop quartets may get +- 1 cent<br/>on 7-limit otonalities.  This is to say that at some time<br/>during the sustained chord this accuracy is reached -- not<br/>necessarily that the entire duration of the chord stays<br/>within this range of JI (in fact I believe it is very important<br/>to music to have &apos;noisy&apos; &apos;attack effects&apos; that help listeners<br/>pick up new events).</p><p>For mixed ensembles playing music of a normal &quot;Western&quot; pace,<br/>+- 2-5 cents seems about as good as can be done or heard.</p><p>None of this means, as far as I can tell, that applying these<br/>random errors to a target of, say, 22-et, will sound the same<br/>as applying them to a target of JI.  So the whole &apos;they don&apos;t<br/>play within that accuracy anyway&apos; thing is a wash.  And as<br/>Paul/Ara pointed out (why do you use pseudonyms, Paul? -- it&apos;s<br/>very rude), you can notate in 22 or what have you and still<br/>bend to JI as well as any of the examples above (brass quintets,<br/>barbershop quartets, etc.) bend from 12.</p><p>Notation<br/>--------</p><p>As a composer and performer, my goals for the ideal notation of<br/>melodic-harmonic music would be:</p><p>(1) Notate the basic scale as simply as possible.  For example:<br/>successive movements on a staff give successive steps through<br/>the scale, one letter for each member of the scale, etc.</p><p>(2) Define accidentals only as needed to uniquely ennumerate<br/>all the chords you want from their nearest approximation in<br/>scale steps of the basic melodic scale.</p><p>(3) Being able to notate all the keys of the melodic scale<br/>(its &quot;Cartesian cross set&quot;) at once is a nice-to-have, which<br/>is seems easy to commensurate with (1) if your basic scale is<br/>an MOS (conventional notation, for example, conflates 25:24<br/>and 2187:2048 in its accidentals).  Key information can also<br/>be specified with a clef.</p><p>If you want only JI chords, the accidentals can be numbers<br/>showing the vertical relationships, and common tones can be<br/>shown by connecting pitches between chords with a line.</p><p>If I wanted to write for an ensemble of instruments and<br/>actually get my music performed, I would make an electronic<br/>version.  And if I still wanted an acoustic version I would<br/>take the electronic version to them, with versions for each<br/>instrument where the given instrument is on one one stereo<br/>channel only, and the rest of the mix on the other.  The<br/>balance knob on the performers&apos; home stereo then becomes a<br/>mixer allowing for invaluable practice opportunities.</p><p>Then, judging from their willingness, and the rehearsal time<br/>available, I would choose whether to issue parts in<br/>xenharmonic notation (see items 1-4) or in the nearest<br/>meantone (up to 31) approximation  (tab).  Where things break<br/>down, your desired common tones can be linked with lines on<br/>the score.</p><p>Until a musical culture springs up around extended meantone,<br/>porcupine, pajara, or miracle, I would refrain from<br/>&quot;standardizing&quot; notation based on 31, 15, 22, or 72.</p><p>If these 72-toners can actually play, well, let&apos;s face it:<br/>they can&apos;t.  If somebody wants to prove me wrong, it would be<br/>quite simple: send them a score for a single, 11-limit<br/>otonality and post the recording here.

I doubt Maneri,<br/>or anyone else on this planet, has heard a fraction of<br/>them.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d say trust me (as I was there and have some experiential<br/>&gt;basis in reality for what I&apos;m telling you), but I know better!</p><p>Good.  Because if they haven&apos;t any practice playing in<br/>extended JI, the chances of them doing it out-of-the-box<br/>from JI notated in 72 is nil, nil, plus nil.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>mean they&apos;ll never do it.  They might pick it up relatively<br/>quickly.  But there will be rehearsal time involved, and<br/>enough of it to be a potential problem for any composer<br/>trying to get his work performed.  This, Dan, I know from<br/>experience.
