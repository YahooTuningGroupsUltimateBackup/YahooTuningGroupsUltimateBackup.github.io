As another exponent of rational intonation (RI) as a<br/>very creative approach to tuning and music, I would like not only to<br/>applaud your paper and some of the properties you are finding in large<br/>integer ratios (prime and otherwise), but to address what may be some<br/>possible misunderstandings about RI and its relationship to other<br/>approaches, including traditional &quot;low-integer&quot; JI and various kinds<br/>of irrational temperaments.</p><p>First, RI is not in my view intended as a substitute for intimate<br/>familiarity with the intonational spectrum, but rather as one means of<br/>exploring that spectrum. When I see that a given integer ratio is<br/>slightly larger than 706 cents, I automatically as it were place it<br/>somewhere between 17-tET and 39-tET, for example. The ratio takes on<br/>meaning both from its integer associations, which might evoke various<br/>complementary ratios in a tuning scheme, and from its place on the<br/>spectrum.</p><p>Secondly, I would consider RI &quot;valley/plateau-neutral&quot;: it may be used<br/>either closely to approximate simple and discretely audible JI ratios,<br/>or very intentionally to seek complex plateaus of a kind also sought<br/>by devices such as the Noble Mediant; thank you, Jacky, for your<br/>enthusiastic interest in this concept.</p><p>Third, I would certainly not consider RI a replacement for any other<br/>kind of tuning system or philosophy, just another approach with a<br/>potential for enriching our view of all the others. I find that pure<br/>Pythagorean JI/RI, adaptive neo-Gothic JI for ratios of 2-3-7 of the<br/>kind I&apos;m discussing here, regular temperaments, well-temperaments, and<br/>some very interesting RI systems (circulating or non-circulating) all<br/>have their place.</p><p>Fourth, I would suggest that some of the &quot;controversies&quot; involving<br/>large integer ratios are matters of conceptual as well as musical<br/>taste, and that viewpoint here can differ. Personally, my enthusiasm<br/>for ratios such as 14:11 or 13:11 or 32:27 or 81:64 does not depend on<br/>their discreet audibility; they are a part of my musical tradition,<br/>and I embrace them, without claiming any &quot;superiority&quot; to other<br/>approaches and traditions.</p><p>Fifth, I find that RI is a fine art which can increase my familiarity<br/>with simple as well as complex ratios, and help me to get to know the<br/>spectrum better. Ratios can serve as names for interesting places and<br/>reference points on the continuum of tunings and temperaments.</p><p>Sixth, I find that my encounters with RI can lead to a curious form of<br/>&quot;well-tuning&quot; or maybe &quot;fine-tuning&quot; resembling a well-temperament in<br/>seeking some scheme combining a near-even division of the octave with<br/>some creative asymmetries -- and also, often, a number of audibly pure<br/>JI ratios. It is kind of like doing JI and temperament at the same<br/>time, and the kind of judgments required can test one&apos;s feel for both<br/>approaches.</p><p>Seventh, I would urge that a pluralistic RI approach not be confused<br/>with the kind of unfortunate viewpoint which takes a given number,<br/>prime factor, or mathematical property, and presents it as the one<br/>valid solution to tuning. If RI was presented as a solution &quot;instead<br/>of...,&quot; I would dissent; as a solution &quot;in addition to...,&quot; I applaud<br/>it.</p><p>To me, large integer ratios have a special poetry, and thank you,<br/>Jacky, for your creative ideas in these and related areas, and<br/>especially your championship of complex ratios and intervals as a very<br/>important part of the art of music and intonation.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=17495 href="#17495">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/14/2001 7:50:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

What I have been<br/>seeing, is that it is indeed very important to consider what we see<br/>in the language of the higher primes - and especially the prime<br/>series ratios. There are some very curious, and incredibly compelling<br/>properties to be found here; those which reveal a kind of geometrical<br/>relationship to all lower ratios. It provides yet another wonderful<br/>and valid method of measurement of the pitch continuum.</p><p>Part of the fun for me, is that it seems to not be &quot;in vogue&quot;, as<br/>I&apos;ve gotten the most positive responses about this from seasoned<br/>RI/JI composers, such as yourself, and Kraig Grady.</p><p>(What&apos;s happened to that old &quot;Prime Warrior&quot; Joe Monzo? Worn from<br/>battling alone perhaps?)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, RI is not in my view intended as a substitute for intimate<br/>&gt; familiarity with the intonational spectrum, but rather as one means<br/>of<br/>&gt; exploring that spectrum. When I see that a given integer ratio is<br/>&gt; slightly larger than 706 cents, I automatically as it were place it<br/>&gt; somewhere between 17-tET and 39-tET, for example. The ratio takes on<br/>&gt; meaning both from its integer associations, which might evoke<br/>various<br/>&gt; complementary ratios in a tuning scheme, and from its place on the<br/>&gt; spectrum.</p><p>As time goes on, I am experiencing a deepening appreciation of<br/>looking at tuning systems from these many different methods of<br/>measurement, and see value in all, with regard to the power it gives<br/>one to communicate in the many &quot;popular&quot; tuning languages of today.</p><p>You will notice on this list, that we commonly compare intervals two<br/>ways; either with low integer ratios, or equal temperaments. All that<br/>I might humbly try to contribute, is to expand our view, with<br/>the &quot;short hand&quot; to complexity, that is provided by the Prime Series<br/>Ratios. I did not reveal its most elegant property in my paper.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secondly, I would consider RI &quot;valley/plateau-neutral&quot;: it may be<br/>used<br/>&gt; either closely to approximate simple and discretely audible JI<br/>ratios,<br/>&gt; or very intentionally to seek complex plateaus of a kind also sought<br/>&gt; by devices such as the Noble Mediant; thank you, Jacky, for your<br/>&gt; enthusiastic interest in this concept.</p><p>Here I must thank first Paul Erlich for guiding me to the Noble<br/>Mediant article, then you and Dave Keenan for opening a new world to<br/>me. And also a new flower that has grown forth from Belgium: Peter<br/>Mulkers. But I have also learned mightily from John Chalmers, Kraig<br/>Grady and Erv Wilson&apos;s articles. (The wonders of the internet in<br/>action!)  I would site this as one of the most important things I&apos;ve<br/>learned from my interactions here, which has *huge* implications for<br/>all future tuning efforts.</p><p>Peter Mulkers, along with Erv Wilson, are two folks that I&apos;m aware<br/>of, that have taken this to the greatest extremes, by methodically<br/>mapping side-by-side the mediant spectrums.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Third, I would certainly not consider RI a replacement for any other<br/>&gt; kind of tuning system or philosophy, just another approach with a<br/>&gt; potential for enriching our view of all the others. I find that pure<br/>&gt; Pythagorean JI/RI, adaptive neo-Gothic JI for ratios of 2-3-7 of the<br/>&gt; kind I&apos;m discussing here, regular temperaments, well-temperaments,<br/>and<br/>&gt; some very interesting RI systems (circulating or non-circulating)<br/>all<br/>&gt; have their place.</p><p>This is brilliance in its purest unadulterated form! And I also find<br/>value in understanding and making use of comparative analysis of<br/>tunings. With all the means at our disposal to &quot;puree&quot; the octave,<br/>each one gives us yet another valid way to measure the pitch<br/>continuum.  As we all know there are many ways to the same places,<br/>and one must harness those best for your musical/theoretical<br/>purposes.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fourth, I would suggest that some of the &quot;controversies&quot; involving<br/>&gt; large integer ratios are matters of conceptual as well as musical<br/>&gt; taste, and that viewpoint here can differ. Personally, my enthusiasm<br/>&gt; for ratios such as 14:11 or 13:11 or 32:27 or 81:64 does not depend<br/>on<br/>&gt; their discreet audibility; they are a part of my musical tradition,<br/>&gt; and I embrace them, without claiming any &quot;superiority&quot; to other<br/>&gt; approaches and traditions.</p><p>I would agree here. It has been an important realization of late,<br/>that our arcane ideas about the audibility of odd and prime limits,<br/>and a preference for only the lower number ratios, actually can block<br/>our view of the musical wonders which lie in the higher primes. There<br/>are so many valid reasons why we can, and must go to higher primes,<br/>and whether or not they will be possibly perceived as lower number<br/>ratios or not, becomes a completely unusable reference point. We<br/>should not worry at all, that with the inclusion of higher primes in<br/>a tuning system, that they should always have &quot;discreet audibility&quot;.<br/>This is something that IMHO, represents a kind of<br/>intellectual/musical paralysis to the RI/JI composer. When we leave<br/>this old concept behind - freedom is what we find!</p><p>Concepts of &quot;Odd and Prime Limits&quot; are only good for *general*<br/>descriptions at best, when we look to expand the RI palette. Whether<br/>they are perceptible after a certain point, is irrelevant to me at<br/>this point.  No bold claims about odd and prime will be heard from my<br/>quarter.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fifth, I find that RI is a fine art which can increase my<br/>familiarity<br/>&gt; with simple as well as complex ratios, and help me to get to know<br/>the<br/>&gt; spectrum better. Ratios can serve as names for interesting places<br/>and<br/>&gt; reference points on the continuum of tunings and temperaments.</p><p>Absolutely!!!  One atomic level observation here, is that higher<br/>prime ratios always display a mathematical interconnectedness to the<br/>lower and visa versa. And it just gives us another valid way to look<br/>at things.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sixth, I find that my encounters with RI can lead to a curious form<br/>of<br/>&gt; &quot;well-tuning&quot; or maybe &quot;fine-tuning&quot; resembling a well-temperament<br/>in<br/>&gt; seeking some scheme combining a near-even division of the octave<br/>with<br/>&gt; some creative asymmetries -- and also, often, a number of audibly<br/>pure<br/>&gt; JI ratios. It is kind of like doing JI and temperament at the same<br/>&gt; time, and the kind of judgments required can test one&apos;s feel for<br/>both<br/>&gt; approaches.</p><p>And to me, you have struck the mother-lode of gold, and reason of why<br/>it is so crucial to embrace the spectrum of ratios outside the lower<br/>primes.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seventh, I would urge that a pluralistic RI approach not be confused<br/>&gt; with the kind of unfortunate viewpoint which takes a given number,<br/>&gt; prime factor, or mathematical property, and presents it as the one<br/>&gt; valid solution to tuning. If RI was presented as a solution &quot;instead<br/>&gt; of...,&quot; I would dissent; as a solution &quot;in addition to...,&quot; I<br/>applaud<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>Agreed! There are so many beautiful and meaningful ways to tune and<br/>make music. This is the most important thing for me, as I enjoy<br/>appreciating them all. I should point out that I&apos;m not necessarily<br/>fixated with ratio derived tunings alone - but may be about<br/>microtonality in general. I have made music with many *popular* ETs,<br/>but also &quot;JI/RI&quot;, &quot;NJNE&quot;, &quot;Non-Octave JI&quot;, &quot;Non-Octave Spectrum<br/>Scales&quot;, BP, Constant Scales, MOS, etc - I actively seek to know what<br/>these tunings *SOUND LIKE* so that I may best understand them and<br/>make music with the properties found in each. I will never be<br/>prepared to settle on just one thing, as I find it just way too<br/>constraining for achieving greater levels of tuning comprehension - a<br/>life&apos;s work.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me, large integer ratios have a special poetry, and thank you,<br/>&gt; Jacky, for your creative ideas in these and related areas, and<br/>&gt; especially your championship of complex ratios and intervals as a<br/>very<br/>&gt; important part of the art of music and intonation.</p><p>As always, it is most refreshing to get the quality of positive input<br/>from someone such as yourself, so eloquent in the language of the<br/>ratios.</p><p>Thanks kindly,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
