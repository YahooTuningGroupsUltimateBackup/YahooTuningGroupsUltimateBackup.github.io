Here&apos;s a bit more, now about<br/>microtonality:</p><p>Just another observation that follows something I said about a week ago.</p><p>It strikes me, again, what most people have ignored about Ives is the<br/>microtonal issue.  They&apos;ve been struck with this atonal thing, and<br/>that polytonal thing, and this polyrhythmic thing.  Not that those are<br/>insignificant, but as time has passed, they, for their own sake, are<br/>not enough to make Ives&apos;s music striking.  It now does that pretty<br/>much through its own worth.</p><p>But if there&apos;s still one thing to make us say, &quot;Wow, how was he able<br/>to do that in 19--&quot;, it&apos;s the issues I was discussing with Johnny in<br/>earlier posts, microtonality and various schemes of tuning.</p><p>As noted, even temperament makes tuning certain instruments much<br/>easier, as least in the absence of modern technology.  When even<br/>temperament took over, 12-tone/atonal music was inevitable, not a bad<br/>thing, IMO, I should note.  But when we come to the Second Viennese<br/>School, and then the Total Serialist school, we find the potential for<br/>innovation in even temperament is largely spent.</p><p>The neo-tonal folks like Del Tredici and the late George Rochberg say<br/>the answer is to step backward.  Minimalists like Philip Glass (and to<br/>a lesser degree, Steve Reich and John Adams) say the answer is to go<br/>backwards harmonically, but try to do something different in regards<br/>to rhythm and melody.</p><p>Ives, however, if not the only one, is one of the very few to say the<br/>answer is to go both backward and forward, in a sense, with the<br/>rejection of even temperament.  The desire for just intonantion or<br/>schemes approximating it is not quite the same as microtonal composers<br/>who might propose a 24 tone quartertone octave that still has equal<br/>temperament between the 24 tones, in other words, not a quest to<br/>extend dodecaphony to include a few more tones.  It is a quest to<br/>realize a &quot;new&quot; harmony, one essentially as old as nature, but never<br/>really exploited by composers.  It is the next logical step after 12-tone.</p><p>I find it interesting to note that in 1927 Eugene Goosens had to deal<br/>with a new kind of orchestral playing with the 4th Symphony, and<br/>almost 70 years later, Johnny faced a similar task with the Universe.<br/>   How many people can maintain themselves in the vanguard for seven<br/>decades, especially when they&apos;ve been dead for four of them?!?</p><p>It really tells me, as I&apos;ve said before, despite all the &quot;he did this<br/>before anyone else&quot;&apos;s or even one person&apos;s &quot;he just made it look like<br/>he did this before anyone else,&quot; the surprises are still coming from<br/>CEI, and the music world hasn&apos;t even really begun to evaluate what he<br/>pointed them toward 90 YEARS AGO.</p><p>I must be in a manic phase today....</p></div>
