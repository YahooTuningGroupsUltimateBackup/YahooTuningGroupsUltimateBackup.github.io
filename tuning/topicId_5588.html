So instead of 12 tones,<br/>&gt; there is a continuum...  The singer passes through pitch AREAS.</p><p>Numerous instruments can play continuous gradations of pitch (like the<br/>theremin; wolves howling or whales singing also seem to do this),<br/>although it is going to be likely that the pause or change-direction<br/>points are going to strongly suggest a familiar scale-type, like a<br/>pentatonic or diatonic mode.  Perhaps this is what you mean by &quot;areas&quot;<br/>(the &quot;area&quot; concept should be applicable in much harmonic praxis).  But<br/>I&apos;d love to hear for myself.  If I can&apos;t hear this on the broadcast, is<br/>there a recording (of kvaeda singing) that you can recommend?  Thanks,</p><p>--<br/>Andrew L. Kaye, Ph.D.<br/>Asst.
