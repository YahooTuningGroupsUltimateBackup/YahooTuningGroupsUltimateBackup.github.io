These scales have not been successfully<br/>described by anyone. Since they are tuned by ear it seems reasonable (but not<br/>conclusive) that there is some sort of acoustical phenomenon going on. For<br/>instance, if you needed instruments to project volume, JI would be the worse in<br/>that they are the softer valleys in the pitch continuum. The drop in volume helps<br/>when tuning them! Beats on the other hand make it possible to be heard over a<br/>larger area. That each village has its own tuning should make up stand back and<br/>notice one of the greatest and largest explosions of new tunings since ancient<br/>Greece!<br/>    Pardon by lack of poetic gesture by reducing a living force, a scale , to a<br/>mere it.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for responding, Kraig.
