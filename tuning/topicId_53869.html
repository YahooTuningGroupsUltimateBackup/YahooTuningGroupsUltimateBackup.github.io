But yes, Fokker&apos;s own blocks did sometimes<br/>have a couple of notes that were harmonically disconnected from the<br/>others -- this was the result of pointy parallelepiped corners.<br/>My &quot;excursion&quot; which you read hints at one way to reduce the<br/>occurrence of such pointy corners.</p></div><h3>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2004 7:42:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kraig, I&apos;d really enjoy continuing this communication with you, so<br/>&gt; I&apos;m doing the best I can.

Every time you eliminate a comma, you effectively slice the<br/>lattice in two places (a comma apart), and connect the two ends<br/>together. I&apos;ve made a more detailed post on this in the past, and<br/>Monz, with his new Tonalsoft software, can make it much more explicit<br/>with actual pictures of this cylinder and torus.</p><p>I think I had you do this at one point -- you started with a big,<br/>flat 5-limit lattice. Then you cut a random line through the lattice,<br/>and cut a second line, parallel to the first, a syntonic comma away.<br/>Then you took what remained between the two cuts, and bent it into a<br/>cylinder, with the two cuts meeting each other, so that the<br/>connections between notes matched up correctly across the cuts. Do<br/>you remember this?</p><p>Now if you had done this with a flexible rubber sheet, you&apos;d be able<br/>to repeat the process, only now making two parallel cuts that were<br/>separated by an *enharmonic equivalence* -- that is, if one cut went<br/>through Ab at a certain angle, the other would go through G# at the<br/>same angle.

If you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know what an abelian group is, you can google for the answer. If<br/>&gt; you  don&apos;t know what someone means by &quot;an invariant set of notes&quot;, you<br/>&gt; are going to remain lost and clueless.</p><p>I can&apos;t say I&apos;m sickened, but I&apos;m certainly deeply troubled by this attitude.  From my POV, many of the conventions of mathematical discourse are a considerable barrier to understanding.  The worst cases are those books or papers which begin by introducing a set of terms or even, *shudder*, notation before saying what it&apos;s going to be used for.   They then proceed to state a load of theorems using that notation and, if you&apos;re lucky, explain them using the new terminology.  Which means you have to keep flicking back to see what it&apos;s supposed to mean.  Quite often you also have to know some obscure terminology from a field that is given a vague name such as &quot;linear algebra&quot; that you thought you were already familiar with.  So you need to read a few more books to find out what things are called today.  At the end of all this, you might find a useful result that can be expressed in a few lines of C code.</p><p>Now, perhaps among professional mathematicians this kind of thing really does work.  When you&apos;ve spent enough years learning the field, and you absolutely need to understand something in all its complexity, and don&apos;t worry about things outside your field, the effort may be worth it for the gain of precision and conciseness.  But for outsiders, it&apos;s really a disaster.  That you don&apos;t seem to appreciate this goes some way to explaining why you have such difficulty communicating.</p><p>I&apos;m also tempted to say that anybody who thinks that 29 is a multiple of 12 has no right to start pontificating about precision of language. There you go, I&apos;ve said it.</p><p>As for your example, yes, you can google for &quot;abelian group&quot;.  You&apos;ll get a few different definitions, all of which refer you to the definition of &quot;group&quot;.  From &quot;group&quot;, you immediately get hit with &quot;set&quot;.  Frankly, if you haven&apos;t already studied group theory your best bet is to get a book on it.  Schaum&apos;s Outlines is good, and only assumes a high school background for really smart readers.  Abelian Groups are introduced on page 177.</p><p>If the reader has studied group theory, they should already know what an abelian group is, of course.  So they won&apos;t be Googling.</p><p>The worst case is that the reader will think they already know what a group or set is, as these words have different meanings in different contexts.  They will then get deeply confused both as to what it is you&apos;re talking about and why they don&apos;t understand it.  This is the very problem you persist in having with the word &quot;lattice&quot;.</p><p>Certainly as far as this list is concerned, whenever you feel the temptation to talk about abelian groups you should really stop to think of a better way of explaining whatever point you were trying to get across.</p><p>Dave:<br/>&gt;  I&apos;d much rather we called &gt;&gt;something &quot;the simple 7-limit minor thirds temperament&quot; instead &gt;&gt;of &quot;keenan&quot;, and &quot;prime exponent vector&quot; rather than &quot;monzo&quot;, &gt;&gt;and &quot;prime generator mapping&quot; rather than &quot;val&quot;. Gene:<br/>&gt; &quot;Simple 7-limit minor thirds temperament&quot; is a mouthful, and &quot;prime<br/>&gt; exponent vector&quot; suggests wen should be talking about vectors and<br/>&gt; vector spaces. &quot;Prime generator mapping&quot; is vague and confusing, and<br/>&gt; certainly does not tell us that *every* interval in some p-limit is<br/>&gt; being mapped, nor that the mappings do not necessarily have to do with<br/>&gt; generators.</p><p>Yes, &quot;simple 7-limit minor thirds temperament&quot; is a bit of a mouthful, but at least it gives people some idea what you&apos;re talking about. Presumably, a linear temperament with a generator of a minor third that approximated 7-limit JI.  And, if you can think of more than one such example, the simplest one.  &quot;Keenan&quot;, on the other hand, has to be looked up.  And where to do that?  My list of linear temperaments is incomplete in the face of the barrage of new, and sometimes contradictory names being proposed and immediately adopted.  I think Paul has a database but it&apos;s only 5-limit.  Both require you to know that you want a linear temperament.  Monz&apos;s dictionary may one day include them, with the result that the index will get bloated down and make it harder for people to find more useful terms.  However much trouble you find it to type, you should really make that effor for your readers, because it makes it so much easier for them.</p><p>The only value I can see in this naming processes is if somebody can fix a definitive list of names, and everybody else sticks to it.  The only thing else than calling a temperament by an obscure name is calling it by lots of different obscure names.</p><p>Hey, how about we find cute names for all the equal temperaments up to 100?</p><p>There are a whole host of contexts where the term &quot;vector&quot; gets used with no reference to vector spaces.  Mathematicians who are so out of touch with the rest of the world that they make this assumption could always try a Google search (as you expect mere mortals to do upon being confronted with an abelian group).  The first result I get is in Japanese.  The second is to the Java API documentation.  A vector in this case is a list of things with no pre-defined size.  Nothing to do with vector spaces, and close to our &quot;prime exponent vector&quot;.  Next up, something about DNA.  Probably nothing whatsoever to do with our &quot;vectors&quot;.</p><p>Then, Scalable Vector Graphics.  Vectors here are roughly what they are in Physics -- something with a magnitude and a direction.  You could call this a special case of a vector space, like you could call addition a special case of an abelian group.  But if you think addition suggests abelian groups, you&apos;re crazy.</p><p>The term &quot;val&quot; doesn&apos;t suggest anything to most people, as it&apos;s utterly meaningless.  To understand your own definition, they&apos;ll have to understand free abelian groups, torsion elements and non-canonically isomorphic dual groups.  They&apos;re really far more likely to guess what &quot;prime generator mapping&quot; means.  If every interval in the p-limit must be mapped for whatever you&apos;re explaning, you should say so regardless. Even people who understood your &quot;val&quot; definition may have forgotten this detail.  Most people, and this may come as a shock to you, don&apos;t worry about terms being vague.  They work out the intended meaning from the context.</p><p>And heaven help you if you try to search for &quot;val&quot; on Google.</p><p>&gt; If they go find an explanation, they have a better chance of figuring<br/>&gt; out what it means than if they try to cook one up and get it wrong,<br/>&gt; which is what&apos;s likely to happen using your system. I really prefer<br/>&gt; not to sow unneeded confusion.</p><p>If you think most people here have a hope of understanding the explanations they&apos;ll find on your site you&apos;re sadly deluded.  You certainly aren&apos;t sowing confusion there -- you fend off confusion with an initial barrier of total incomprehensibility.</p><p>                            Graham</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2004 8:24:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54465">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54465</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, how about we find cute names for all the equal temperaments up<br/>to 100?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Please put me down in favor of &quot;mouthfulls&quot; rather than cutsie<br/>terminology...</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2004 10:38:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you think most people here have a hope of understanding the<br/>&gt; explanations they&apos;ll find on your site you&apos;re sadly deluded.

If you<br/>&gt;&gt; don&apos;t know what an abelian group is, you can google for the answer.<br/>&gt;&gt; If you  don&apos;t know what someone means by &quot;an invariant set of<br/>&gt;&gt; notes&quot;, you are going to remain lost and clueless.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I can&apos;t say I&apos;m sickened, but I&apos;m certainly deeply troubled by this<br/>&gt;attitude.  From my POV, many of the conventions of mathematical<br/>&gt;discourse are a considerable barrier to understanding.  The worst cases<br/>&gt;are those books or papers which begin by introducing a set of terms or<br/>&gt;even, *shudder*, notation before saying what it&apos;s going to be used for.<br/>&gt;  They then proceed to state a load of theorems using that notation and,<br/>&gt;if you&apos;re lucky, explain them using the new terminology.  Which means<br/>&gt;you have to keep flicking back to see what it&apos;s supposed to mean.  Quite<br/>&gt;often you also have to know some obscure terminology from a field that<br/>&gt;is given a vague name such as &quot;linear algebra&quot; that you thought you were<br/>&gt;already familiar with.  So you need to read a few more books to find out<br/>&gt;what things are called today.  At the end of all this, you might find a<br/>&gt;useful result that can be expressed in a few lines of C code.</p><p>You go, Graham!</p><p>&gt;Now, perhaps among professional mathematicians this kind of thing really<br/>&gt;does work.  When you&apos;ve spent enough years learning the field, and you<br/>&gt;absolutely need to understand something in all its complexity, and don&apos;t<br/>&gt;worry about things outside your field, the effort may be worth it for<br/>&gt;the gain of precision and conciseness.  But for outsiders, it&apos;s really a<br/>&gt;disaster.  That you don&apos;t seem to appreciate this goes some way to<br/>&gt;explaining why you have such difficulty communicating.</p><p>This needed to be said.  In Gene&apos;s defense, he seems to be trying.<br/>I&apos;ve always just viewed it as perhaps the &apos;cost&apos;, at least in his<br/>case, of the thinking he used to get to where he is.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m also tempted to say that anybody who thinks that 29 is a multiple<br/>&gt;of 12 has no right to start pontificating about precision of language.<br/>&gt;There you go, I&apos;ve said it.</p><p>That&apos;s a different kind of thing.  But again, the oblivious professor<br/>is perhaps romanticized for a reason.  By this I mean that if you&apos;re<br/>oblivious to some things, maybe you&apos;re paying that much more attention<br/>to others.</p><p>&gt;As for your example, yes, you can google for &quot;abelian group&quot;.  You&apos;ll<br/>&gt;get a few different definitions, all of which refer you to the<br/>&gt;definition of &quot;group&quot;.  From &quot;group&quot;, you immediately get hit with<br/>&gt;&quot;set&quot;.  Frankly, if you haven&apos;t already studied group theory your best<br/>&gt;bet is to get a book on it.  Schaum&apos;s Outlines is good, and only<br/>&gt;assumes a high school background for really smart readers.  Abelian<br/>&gt;Groups are introduced on page 177.</p><p>As someone who&apos;s struggled with Gene&apos;s stuff for years now, I will<br/>say that as much as I hope for better explanations from him, I&apos;m<br/>also thankful for the improvement in my understanding of mathematics<br/>our conversations have brought.</p><p>&gt;The only value I can see in this naming processes is if somebody can<br/>&gt;fix a definitive list of names, and everybody else sticks to it.</p><p>Yes, that would be nice, wouldn&apos;t it.

If you choose a fifth of size<br/>(2048/11)^(1/13) it will have a wolf, for 14 notes of meantone, of<br/>size 11/8. This fifth is 696.05 and is closely approximated by the<br/>fifth of 50-equal, which is 696 cents exactly. Very much along the<br/>same lines is taking 16 notes of meantone with a fifth of size<br/>(416)^(1/15), which nets you a wolf fifth of 16/13; the fifth here is<br/>of size 696.04.</p><p>These nifty wolf fifths are related to the excellence of 50-et for 11<br/>and 13 overtones, as is my &quot;ratwolf&quot; idea of making the wolf in 12<br/>notes of meantone exactly 20/13. I&apos;ll post something about 50 over on<br/>tuning-math.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2004 7:21:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; The subject line gives a point I think should be possible to make<br/>&gt; on this list, but frankly I just am not sure when and why the<br/>&gt; screaming is going to start.

I&apos;ll have to explain more later.</p><p>It does however have to do with the fact that we were using comma<br/>inflections to notate JI or rational pitches relative to the<br/>nominals A to G, considered to be in a chain of just fifths, FCGDAEB.</p><p>The apotome is the &quot;comma&quot; that is normally notated with a sharp or<br/>flat (2048:2187) in JI or Pythagoraen tunings. Apotome symbols are<br/>purely 3-limit. They just let you extend the chain of fifths up or<br/>down.</p><p>The first thing to notice about these comma category boundaries is<br/>that they are complementary within the apotome. Or putting it<br/>another way, they are symmetrical about the half apotome. All except<br/>for the somewhat-arbitrary boundary between schismas and kleismas<br/>that is. So we have the following complementary pairs of categories.</p><p>schisminas complementary to apotomes<br/>schismas or kleismas complementary to large semitones<br/>commas complementary to limmas<br/>small dieses complementary to small semitones<br/>(medium) dieses complementary to large dieses</p><p>We wanted to name commas (broad sense) according to what ratios they<br/>allowed us to notate. Since we can use the same symbol to notate<br/>ratios having any number of 2&apos;s or 3&apos;s in them just by changing<br/>octaves or nominals on the chain of fifths. The important thing<br/>about a ratio for notation purposes was the powers of the primes<br/>greater than 3 that it contained. So we took to calling commas by<br/>this part, such as &quot;5-comma&quot; for the Didymus or syntonic comma of<br/>80:81, and &quot;7-comma&quot; for the Archytas or septimal comma of 63:64.</p><p>But there is more than one comma (broad sense) that will let you<br/>notate a given ratio. For example a 5/4 (from C as 1/1) can be<br/>notated as a syntonic comma less than the Pythagorean E or as a<br/>schisma more than a Pythagorean Fb.</p><p>It was natural in this case to call one the 5-comma and the other<br/>the 5-schisma. And through examining many such sets of multiple<br/>commas like this, usable for notating the same ratio in different<br/>ways, it eventually became clear that we could guarantee a unique<br/>name for each, which would also indicate its approximate size, just<br/>by having the boundaries of what were existing (but vague and<br/>overlapping) categories at the above square-roots (half cents) of<br/>various 3-limit commas.</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2004 5:23:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 7/12/04 9:09 PM, monz &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; please do keep the reports of broken links coming!</p><p>Maybe just load your site into Dreamweaver or something which will check the<br/>entire site within seconds for broken links.</p><p>I haven&apos;t used Dreamweaver much for this and kind of stopped using the<br/>program because it was such a hunk of junk, but chances are there are other<br/>possibilities, maybe even freeware that others could suggest?</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2004 7:40:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54577">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54577</a></p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; hi Dave,<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; please write up a definition of skhismina which is similar<br/>&gt; &gt; to my definition #2 of &quot;skhisma&quot;, and i&apos;ll include it in<br/>&gt; &gt; the Encyclopaedia.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; schismina, skhismina<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A generally imperceptiple interval, smaller than a schisma.</p><p>I&apos;m envisioning the scena for naming a schismina:<br/>Not wanting to be meana, we&apos;re going for sublima<br/>We wouldn&apos;t want to misma, by only doing schisma<br/>That&apos;s now so very common,<br/>One might think it&apos;s just a comma, man</p><p>jp</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2004 11:04:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; on 7/12/04 9:09 PM, monz &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; please do keep the reports of broken links coming!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe just load your site into Dreamweaver or something<br/>&gt; which will check the entire site within seconds for broken<br/>&gt; links.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t used Dreamweaver much for this and kind of<br/>&gt; stopped using the program because it was such a hunk of junk,<br/>&gt; but chances are there are other possibilities, maybe even<br/>&gt; freeware that others could suggest?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Kurt</p><p>thanks for those suggestions, Kurt.</p><p>let&apos;s please move any further discussion of this to<br/>metatuning.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@worldonline.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2004 8:59:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, onward to the subject line. If you choose a fifth of size<br/>&gt; (2048/11)^(1/13) it will have a wolf, for 14 notes of meantone, of<br/>&gt; size 11/8. This fifth is 696.05 and is closely approximated by the<br/>&gt; fifth of 50-equal, which is 696 cents exactly. Very much along the<br/>&gt; same lines is taking 16 notes of meantone with a fifth of size<br/>&gt; (416)^(1/15), which nets you a wolf fifth of 16/13; the fifth here is<br/>&gt; of size 696.04.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These nifty wolf fifths are related to the excellence of 50-et for 11<br/>&gt; and 13 overtones, as is my &quot;ratwolf&quot; idea of making the wolf in 12<br/>&gt; notes of meantone exactly 20/13. I&apos;ll post something about 50 over on<br/>&gt; tuning-math.</p><p>Oops!<br/>I&apos;ve come to this idea about two years ago but at that time I knew nothing<br/>about the tuning list so I told only a few people about these things. Well,<br/>I think reader&apos;s don&apos;t mind if I explore this in greater detail now. But<br/>before I start, I&apos;d like to introduce three other facts that will be<br/>important later in my text. First of all, instead of using the word &quot;wolf&quot;<br/>to mean the interval between the last and the first tone of the chain of<br/>fifths, I&apos;m gonna use &quot;wolf&quot; simply in the case of a diminished sixth (this<br/>comes from the way regular 12-tone chains were being tuned over centuries).<br/>Then, to be able to compare meantone tunings efficiently, I decided to<br/>classify them roughly into two groups - the bright ones (i.e. the fifth is<br/>only a little smaller than the just 3/2) and the dark ones (the fifth is<br/>much smaller than 3/2). Finally, for comparing these temperaments, I&apos;m gonna<br/>use the size of the minor second instead of the fifth. The reason is that<br/>the minor second is quite a small interval and therefore changes in its size<br/>are more or less audible. Moreover, the minor second can be described as 3<br/>octaves minus 5 fifths (or 5 fourths minus 2 octaves) and that&apos;s why a<br/>change in the size of a fifth will reflect 5 times stronger (in the opposite<br/>direction) in the size of a minor second. OK, let&apos;s get it.<br/>    I&apos;ll start with the meantone where the double-diminished fifth is tuned<br/>to 11/8. This tuning (let&apos;s call it &quot;MT11&quot;, for example) has a minor second<br/>of ~119.738 cents. Then there&apos;s another tuning (I&apos;ll call it &quot;MT13&quot;) with a<br/>double-augmented fifth tuned to 13/8. In this case, the minor second has<br/>~119.824 cents. Looking carefully at these two may raise another idea. If<br/>11/8 is a double-diminished fifth (for example C-Gbb) and 13/8 is a<br/>double-augmented fifth (i.e. C-G##), then 13/11 could be the difference<br/>between these two (i.e. Gbb-G##). In fact, this is 4 times the size of a<br/>regular chroma because shifting a note a chroma higher always adds a sharp<br/>or removes a flat (Gbb, Gb, G, G#, G##). Of course, you can make such a<br/>meantone (this could be called &quot;MT13/11&quot;) where 4 chromas together make an<br/>exact 13/11 interval. As a result, you get a minor second of ~119.784 cents.<br/>So we could say that MT11 is the brightest of these three tunings, MT13 is<br/>the darkest one, and MT13/11 lies somewhere in-between. Therefore, we can<br/>get to a conclusion that the number 11 works here as some sort of a<br/>&quot;brightener&quot; and the number 13 is some kind of a &quot;darkener&quot; here. Indeed,<br/>this is true. And we can demonstrate it clearly by picking up two other<br/>meantone temperaments (I&apos;ll call them &quot;MT11/5&quot; and &quot;MT13/5&quot;). In the first<br/>of these, the double-diminished third is tuned to 11/10. In the other one,<br/>the augmented third is tuned to 13/10. While in MT11/5 you find a minor<br/>second of ~119.119 cents, MT13/5 has a minor second of ~120.812 cents. If<br/>you think of the 11/10 as the interval between, for instance, E-Gbb, and<br/>13/10 as the interval between E-G##, you find that 13/11 has, again, the<br/>meaning of 4 chromas. So, indeed, between MT11/5 and MT13/5 you find just<br/>the same as between MT11 and MT13 (i.e. MT13/11). Incidentally, the<br/>augmented third is the octave inversion of the wolf (i.e. diminished sixth)<br/>so the MT13/5 can be tuned on a regular 12-tone keyboard by simply dividing<br/>the factor of 416/5 (i.e. augmented third plus 6 octaves) geometrically into<br/>11 equal fifths.<br/>    Even more, lots of interesting similarities appear as we add 7-limit<br/>intervals. It&apos;s a well-known matter that 7/4 can be applied beautifully as<br/>an augmented sixth. That means we have not only a 5-limit major second of<br/>16/15 but also a 7-limit one of 15/14. This minor second has a size of<br/>~119.443 cents. A meantone with such a minor second is a bit brighter than<br/>MT11 and darker than MT11/5. Moreover, if you consider 7/4 to be, for<br/>example, C-A#, then 33/28 comes out as A#-Dbb. Making a meantone where this<br/>is true results in a minor second of ~119.193 cents (quite close to MT11/5).<br/>And that&apos;s still not all. If the number 7 represents A#, then 35 is C## and<br/>so 36/35 should be the enharmonic diesis between C##-D. If you make a<br/>meantone in which this is true, you get a minor second of ~120.321 cents<br/>(i.e. a bit darker than MT13 and brighter than MT13/5). And, to prove the<br/>point, this is extremely close to another meantone in which a major third<br/>downwards (i.e. E-C) has the same beat rate as a major sixth downwards (i.e.<br/>E-G). This tuning has a minor second of ~120.330 cents (or, to be more<br/>precise, ~120.3302118992214 cents). When you take all these things into<br/>account and make a few averages, soon you discover that all of these tunings<br/>are in some ways swinging around 50-tone equal tuning! And that&apos;s why to me<br/>the 50-TET is the &quot;nicest&quot; of all the ET-meantone tunings not exceeding 100<br/>tones per octave. Having read so much about 31-TET, from time to time, I<br/>feel a bit alone in my effort of promoting 50-TET. Fortunately, I got a note<br/>from Monz that Woolhouse also liked 50-TET (thanks a lot for this, Monz) so<br/>I know I&apos;m not quite that alone.<br/>    And what is my conclusion? If someone says that the first 16 elements in<br/>the harmonic series can&apos;t be converted to the standard notation, he&apos;s wrong.<br/>If you don&apos;t mind using such a large chain as 28 fifths, you can do it like<br/>this:</p><p>C       C       G       C<br/>E       G       A#      C<br/>D       E       Gbb     G<br/>G##     A#      B       C</p><p>This may put a question of making such a tuning that behaves much like a<br/>meantone though it&apos;s made purely of just intervals. Of course, these can be<br/>made with no problem. I even suppose that someone found such temperaments<br/>useful much earlier than I did. I remember having read somewhere that<br/>7-limit intervals were being explored quite often during the Renaissance and<br/>the Baroque periods. So I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if someone had come to this<br/>idea as early as in the 16th century. Perhaps some of you know more about<br/>this matter? To demonstrate this, I&apos;ve sent one such tuning in the regular<br/>Scala format. It was originally meant to have the 1/1 on D which makes a<br/>chain of fifths from two flats to three sharps (the most common way of<br/>tuning the chain). But it&apos;s also good to place the 1/1 on E. If you do it<br/>this way, all black keys are sharps and there are no flats at all then.
