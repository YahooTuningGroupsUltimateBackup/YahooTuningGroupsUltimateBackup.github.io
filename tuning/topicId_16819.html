The harmonies were reduced to a set<br/>of basic calculations ever since the figured bass era a generation before<br/>Bach.  Bach modulates to the closely related keys DE-EMPHASIZING differences<br/>in the harmonic idiosyncrasies of the different keys.</p><p>However, since the horizontally based Bach (or simply melodic-based) was more<br/>involved with differences in the etching of melodies (since there wasn&apos;t even<br/>a referent pitch to measure against in Thuringian/Anhalt society), we have to<br/>explore the melodic distinctions of his motifs to determine appropriateness<br/>of key.</p><p>Basically, what I am saying is that melody has been ignored for the harmony,<br/>partly because we don&apos;t even hear with the same acuity melodically as we do<br/>harmonically, at least in terms of pitch accuracy and recognition.</p><p>FYI-For the upcoming Microtonal Bach Christmas show on WKCR, cellist David<br/>Eggar has recorded a set of 6 movements of the Bach Cello Suites, but with<br/>each movement coming from a different suite.  All of these suites are in<br/>Werckmeister III so they are all in the same tuning.  Of course they will<br/>sound different psychologically to the ear, but there are only 12 notes.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=16832 href="#16832">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2000 4:04:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; The only non-equal commercial recording of the WTClavier is by Anthony Newman<br/>&gt; in Aron-Neidhardt II (devised by contemporary Owen Jorgensen).</p><p>There&apos;s also the Ton Koopman, as part of the big Bach boxed set.</p></div><h3><a id=16835 href="#16835">ðŸ”—</a>merlyn &#x3C;merlyn@cats.ucsc.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2000 5:03:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>there&apos;s also a harpsichord recording by Barbara (Nissman i think the<br/>surname is)...</p><p>-b</p></div>
