Thus the hypothesis that sonorities of this type were<br/>performed with schisma thirds on many fixed-pitch keyboards of the<br/>epoch, and may have often been sung or played by flexible-pitch<br/>ensembles with similar smooth thirds, is based on evidence other than<br/>explicit note spellings.</p><p>As to notation, one significant hint does come from Prosdocimus de<br/>Beldemandis writing in 1413, and discussing the distinction between a<br/>&quot;fully perfected&quot; Pythagorean major third or sixth such as A3-C#4 or<br/>A3-F#4, and a diminished fourth or seventh such as A3-Db4 or A3-Gb4.</p><p>Prosdocimus notes that a written notation such as A3-C#3 might<br/>represent either the usual Pythagorean form (which he prefers) or the<br/>diminished fourth A3-Db4 a Pythagorean comma smaller. He leaves it an<br/>open question to what degree the human ear might make a distinction<br/>between these forms.</p><p>Thus as his modern editor and commentator Jan Herlinger observes,<br/>Prosdocimus lends support to the theory of Lindley and others than a<br/>notation such as A3-C#4-E4 could represent either the traditional<br/>Pythagorean intervals or the schisma intonation A3-Db4-E4.</p><p>The line of argument followed by Lindley is that there is a large<br/>amount evidence, both theoretical and stylistic, to support the use of<br/>the Pythagorean Gb-B tuning for 12-note keyboards.</p><p>Discussions of keyboard tunings and designs addressing the<br/>arrangements of minor and major Pythagorean semitones (the smaller<br/>diatonic semitone or limma at 256:243 or ~90.22 cents, and the larger<br/>apotome or chromatic semitone at 2187:2048 or ~113.69 cents), provide<br/>rich documentation for the Gb-B tuning.</p><p>The use of prolonged noncadential sonorities with thirds in keyboard<br/>sources of the time, and the tendency of these sonorities to appear<br/>mainly on degrees where schisma thirds would occur in the Gb-B tuning,<br/>provides an important argument that actual musical style reflected the<br/>intonational distinctions of this keyboard tuning.</p><p>Thus Lindley suggests that much of the early vocal music of Dufay, and<br/>some other composers of the era around 1400-1440 (or a bit earlier in<br/>some parts of Italy), suggests similar patterns of intonation -- or,<br/>at least, that the composers may have been influenced by the tuning of<br/>a keyboard instrument in a Gb-B scheme or the like.</p><p>The remark of Prosdocimus that the written A3-C#4 might also represent<br/>A3-Db4 supports the view that performers might realize regularly<br/>spelled intervals and sonorities in either form.</p><p>Such flexibility also would seem to fit a situation of performer<br/>discretion where a written E3-G3-C4 before D3-A3-D4 might be sung or<br/>played without inflection, as Eb3-G3-C4, or as E3-G#3-C#4.</p><p>Note that on a 12-note keyboard instrument in Gb-B, schisma thirds<br/>would occur automatically, since the performer would perforce press<br/>the key actually tuned at a Pythagorean Ab in order to play a written<br/>note G#; and likewise with Db for written C#, and Gb for written F#.</p><p>Here it is interesting that Prosdocimus himself raises this issue in<br/>order to champion the traditional Pythagorean thirds and sixths at<br/>81:64 and 27:16 -- around 408 cents and 906 cents. He describes these<br/>intervals as &quot;fully perfected,&quot; striving in the most efficient way to<br/>attain the &quot;perfection&quot; of expansion to the 3:2 fifth and 2:1 octave<br/>respectively. When given their full size, these intervals more<br/>&quot;closely approach&quot; these fifths and octaves, resolving by way of<br/>efficient 90-cent diatonic semitones.</p><p>His goal is to have these full Pythagorean thirds and sixths available<br/>throughout an ample gamut, which leads to his proposal for a 17-note<br/>system (Gb-A#) supporting truly intoned closest approach progressions<br/>even in remote transpositions.</p><p>Reading between the lines, we might take his critique of a system with<br/>five flats only -- the Gb-B gamut -- as evidence that by 1413, this<br/>type of 12-note keyboard tuning was already coming into vogue, as the<br/>Faenza Codex documenting Italian keyboard music of around this era<br/>also suggests, with Lindley providing some analyses focusing on<br/>prominent schisma thirds.</p><p>Considering both the apparent popularity of the Gb-B tuning for<br/>keyboards and the traditional &quot;closest approach&quot; ethos of Prosdocimus,<br/>a possible synthesis is available: the use of schisma thirds for<br/>prolonged noncadential sonorities involving written sharps, but<br/>regular Pythagorean thirds for sonorities leading to directed<br/>resolutions, especially those of the traditional 14th-century variety<br/>uniting the major third to fifth and major sixth to octave<br/>progressions (e.g. A3-C#4-F#4 to G3-D4-G4).</p><p>Whether flexible pitch ensembles -- or possibly players on keyboard<br/>instruments with more than 12 notes -- may have done this remains a<br/>guess, but such a &quot;discretionary intonation&quot; would reflect the<br/>cadential ethos of Prosdocimus as well as some of the notational<br/>flexibility he may be documenting, and also the evidence that Lindley<br/>has brought forward for the Gb-B tuning and its possible influences on<br/>Dufay and other composers of vocal music.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=28706 href="#28706">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/28/2001 5:56:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_28704.html#28704">/tuning/topicId_28704.html#28704</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus as his modern editor and commentator Jan Herlinger observes,<br/>&gt; Prosdocimus lends support to the theory of Lindley and others than a<br/>&gt; notation such as A3-C#4-E4 could represent either the traditional<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intervals or the schisma intonation A3-Db4-E4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The line of argument followed by Lindley is that there is a large<br/>&gt; amount evidence, both theoretical and stylistic, to support the use<br/>of the Pythagorean Gb-B tuning for 12-note keyboards.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much, Margo, for this clarification!</p><p>_________ ________ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
