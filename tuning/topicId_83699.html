Using it or not is not quite dependent on octave or non-octave basic material selected for composing - as I showed in some examples, even those chained scales which have different period than octave can include octave intervals and composer can emphasize them or try to hide them. And even in diatonic, pandiatonic or chromatic terrain based on octave we can compose music which emphasizes smaller or bigger intervals in the function of period, or octaves can be even excluded in the extreme case. When talking about all this I mean it in the frame of 12 ET, but it can be easily adapted for microtonal music, where octave can be avoided in more interesting way.</p><p>Octave doubling (and unisons) can be still used - for sure in harmony, or when arranging orchestral groups. Melodically it is special effect with very typical sound, which must be used carefully as it can create thick textures which tend to sound muddy. For me personally is more interesting polystratophonic type of orchestral arrangement, based on simultaneous sounding of different contrasting motifs or elements in different layers, and diversity can be even more emphasized by instrumentation and selected range. It&apos;s a modern version of traditional polyphony, where one layer is represented by one voice. In polystratophony one layer can be a complex music structure.</p><p>I would be the last person who would object against historical (or ethnic) music. I love it, and devoted a lot of time and effort to listening it, analyze it, learn most of those compositional techniques, methods, theories, principles... and also composed lot of music using all that knowledge :-) But it doesn&apos;t mean we have to accept everything from the past, there were also cul-de-sacs, mistakes (from later point of view), and even venerable Masters long-bearded or beardless had bad days when they couldn&apos;t get out from routine work...</p><p>Have a nice day!</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 20 May 2009, at 11:52 PM, Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The octave is the only interval that has a basis for pitch-class &gt; identity.

Furthermore, wouldn&apos;t it be a more interesting alternative in several cases (for many people, at least) to have the ability to have the pitch-classes consistently rotate for more possible moods instead of &quot;duplicating&quot; the mood/&quot;pitch-class&quot; on each octave?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I, for one, never considered the ability to limit the number of moods possible by &quot;duplicating&quot; the mood on a certain interval as necessarily a good thing.&nbsp; I think Daniel is actually spot on with his idea of chromatic &quot;tone confusion&quot; by avoiding the octave and extending the number of pitch-classes accessible in a single tuning without compromising consonance in any significant way (and often, in fact, enhancing it).</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think octave doubling is still valid, and an obvious orchestrational tool *for certain styles*...&quot;<br/>&nbsp; It certainly is...I believe my point, along with Daniels, is that there is no harm in making alternative scales which do not use the octave as a period.&nbsp; Sure, certain music IE Bach and Beethoven, obviously, will need to octave to preserve their original moods and general feel.&nbsp; But for newly composed music...I still do not see harm in scales that do not use the octave, yet maintain most familiar tetra-chords (plus add a few new ones impossible without chromaticism).</p><p>-Michael</p><p>&#x9;</p></div><h3><a id=83710 href="#83710">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2009 7:25:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Agreed, it is a nice thing to have, but it by no means is (or is nearly) the &quot;backbone&quot; of music.&nbsp; Easy example...the Bohlen Pierce scale has no octave, yet still obtains several very use-able chords and different types of harmonies (just not the usual 2/1 4/1 8/1...type harmonies).</p><p>&gt;&quot;When somebody just  copies music of the past, there&apos;s no new information and the result  will be boring.<br/>&nbsp; And, I&apos;m afraid, a lot of pure diatonic mean-tone (including 1/4 comma) and diatonic JI falls into this category.&nbsp; Anything where all notes are only a 3-7 cents off 12TET is likely to sound the same to a huge majority of untrained listeners.</p><p>&gt;&quot;When somebody does some totally innovative and  unusual music (if anything like this is still possible), it will be  boring as well, this time because there will be too much information  and listener&apos;s channels will be soon overfilled.<br/>&nbsp; In general I agree this is true, but, in some cases, universal theories can break past this.&nbsp; For example, Sethares&apos; theories matching tuning and timbre can explain how/why diatonic systems work...or they can be mixed with other tunings, like 10TET, to make natural-sounding music with unearthly timbres or take &quot;in-harmonic&quot; timbres like bells and use them to construct earthly-sounding matching scales.&nbsp; In cases like these, the result is both overly weird/original and bears relevance to the past.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, the whole (1/variable)^x+1 system, I believe, has similar properties...use it with the 2/1 octave and you get (1/2)^x+1, which generates &quot;normal&quot;/proven JI-style ratios.&nbsp; Meanwhile use PHI or the Silver Ratio in it and you get things like the (1/PHI)^x+1 scale system...which obey a similar mathematic construction formula yet, do to the different generator, make radically different scale results that still manage a good degree of familiarity.&nbsp; Kind of like Sethares tuning/timbre correlation work.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m a huge believer in finding different ways to explain JI-type constructs (especially chromatic ones) and then twisting their generators around to create things that are both blatantly new sounding and yet routed in old formulas...depending on how you look at them.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The best music  somehow tries to combine and balance old, known principles with new,  unknown.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; I&apos;ll again agree for the most part...yet will also admit that what tuning often does (IE trying to inject new as simply adding notes onto old)...often does no work too well and result in things like 5-limit JI scales that sound an awfully lot like diatonic ones yet still require much tougher music theory to learn.&nbsp; Better, IMVHO, to jump to 7-limit or something with more substantial expressive advantages to make it worth learning music new theory for.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, personally, I think the whole pattern of insisting that the octave has to be the period for everything and all scale methods must, in the end, fit results higher than 2/1 into the octave by dividing by two is severely hindering the progress of tuning into new territory.<br/>&nbsp;

And, of course, the moment of symmetry is aimed at symmetry at the 2/1 octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     It all begs the question...what if you applied the theories to other intervals and/or occasionally learned something from doing so that could enhance the theories?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Mike,</p><p>Sorry for being late. At the beginning of (I think?) this thread you asked something like &quot;why, if at all, do you think the ear looks for multiplicative and not additive symmetry (or do you think it looks both)?&quot;. The answer is that waves are &quot;added&quot; via the principle of superposition. So the &quot;sum&quot; of 9Hz and 12Hz, say, equals 3Hz because that is actually the frequency being produced. It is in music where the operation of division takes precedence over all others, and multiplication is just it&apos;s inverse operation (As I&apos;ve said before, it is no mistake that the Gk word &quot;logos&quot; and the Latin &quot;ratio&quot; evolved to mean &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;rational&quot;). 8ve equivalence is also a property of wave addition. So I still don&apos;t know where the arithmetic or geometric mean comes in, except perhaps as a novel curiousity.</p><p>As for 8ve equivalence, on a recent post you mentioned that your scale (which one I can&apos;t remember, probably (1/octave)^x + 1) doesn&apos;t produce a MOS at the 8ve but does at the 5th. But 8ve equivalence will still override this. You could always repeat the &apos;same&apos; scale an 8ve higher or lower, irrespective of how the scale was produced. This could also be applied to one of Bill&apos;s &quot;stretched 8ve&apos;s&quot; i.e. a stretched 8ve scale an 8ve higher, and so on. In other words, as Kraig seemed to suggest, 8ve equivalence must &quot;go without saying&quot;.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83729 href="#83729">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2009 7:32:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;which one I can&apos;t remember, probably (1/octave)^x + 1) doesn&apos;t produce a MOS at the 8ve but does at the 5th&quot;<br/>&nbsp; That&apos;s what it does, precisely...and yes you used the right/intended formula.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So the &quot;sum&quot; of 9Hz and 12Hz, say, equals 3Hz because that is actually the frequency being produced.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Exactly, that&apos;s why I keep on suspecting the harmonic series primarily operates on an additive basis with respect to how it produces consonance.&nbsp; The harmonic series has that distinct pattern in the rate of beating between frequencies that hints where the GCD/&quot;root tone&quot; is...and since it&apos;s a difference, it&apos;s based in &quot;addition&quot; and not &quot;multiplication&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You could always repeat the &apos;same&apos; scale an 8ve higher or lower, irrespective of how the scale was produced.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;In other words, as Kraig seemed to suggest, 8ve equivalence must &quot;go without saying&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp; I get the feeling the only thing special about the 8ve musically is that it preserves the exact tonal color/&quot;class&quot;.&nbsp; Which is great if duplicating tonal color over each period is your goal (and I agree it&apos;s the best interval, both as physics/signal-processing-theory and musical feel are concerned) to achieve that.</p><p>&nbsp; However, I really wonder why, if at all, that should dictate how people must create scales (especially if they, like myself, actually are going for as many tonal colors as possible, rather than &quot;perfectly equal/repeating&quot; ones).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely producing keeping repeating tonal colors over a period and consonance are different issues: if they were not, for example, than the circle of 5ths must be terribly dissonant except for (3/2)^12 and (3/2)^1...which is the only combination in the entire circle which really closes in on the 8ve.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=83731 href="#83731">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2009 2:41:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Erv did not publish these so far but then again he often will not till he fills he has covered enough for it to be more than piece meal.<br/>..where can I read about this?

Y(t) = [Acos2pi(9Hz*t)] + [Bcos2pi(12Hz*t)] will produce 3Hz (prove by adding 1/3 seconds x N = 1,2,3,..to the time t. The function Y remains the same for any random choice of t). Here the difference tone is 1/2(12 - 9) = 1.5, an 8ve below the tonic 3. And of course I could have chosen other numbers which have GCD 3 but a completely different difference tone. Why this happens is because 12/9 = 4/3, division and factorisation, not subtraction. Besides, this is not an harmonic series, just two sine waves as yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;You could always repeat the &apos;same&apos; scale an 8ve higher or lower, irrespective of how the scale was produced.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;In other words, as Kraig seemed to suggest, 8ve equivalence must &quot;go without saying&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I get the feeling the only thing special about the 8ve musically is that it preserves the exact tonal color/&quot;class&quot;.  Which is great if duplicating tonal color over each period is your goal (and I agree it&apos;s the best interval, both as physics/signal-processing-theory and musical feel are concerned) to achieve that.</p><p>But Mike, don&apos;t you think it&apos;s quite remarkable that we can play the &quot;same&quot; note on a variety of different instruments which might have nothing else in common? Why can we play &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; on an orchestra, kazoo, or whistle it and still recognise the melody? It is a philosophical concept that is sometimes hard to grasp but pitch-classes, like all classes, are not observable. We can never  hear the pitch-class of a C note because playing it on one instrument is only one element of the class, not the whole class. Playing it on two instruments is another element, not the class. If we play all elements together, the tonal colour is not the same as playing one at a time. If we write a C note on a score, it remains a pitch-class until we assign an instrument and play it. Therefore, a C note contains all possible tonal colours, and none at all.</p><p>So what&apos;s preventing us from playing C3 on a piano and C4 an 8ve higher on a sax or the Nepalese Bagpipe Orchestra? It is still the &quot;same&quot; note an 8ve higher. So tone colour and 8ve equivalence are not necessarily related.</p><p>-Rick</p><p>&gt;   However, I really wonder why, if at all, that should dictate how people must create scales (especially if they, like myself, actually are going for as many tonal colors as possible, rather than &quot;perfectly equal/repeating&quot; ones).<br/>&gt;    Surely producing keeping repeating tonal colors over a period and consonance are different issues: if they were not, for example, than the circle of 5ths must be terribly dissonant except for (3/2)^12 and (3/2)^1...which is the only combination in the entire circle which really closes in on the 8ve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;</p></div>
