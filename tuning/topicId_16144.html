That was one of the first threads I ever<br/>participated in, and you were trying to explain h.e. to me.

He<br/>does discuss the justification Denny used for (a*b), and does attribute<br/>that justification (but not the actual formula, a*b) to Galileo.  The<br/>justification is: when a &amp; b are relatively prime, their product gives<br/>the period of the composite wave.  Presumably, longer composite waves are<br/>harder for the periodicity mechanism to reconcile.</p><p>When did Tenney do his work on a*b?
