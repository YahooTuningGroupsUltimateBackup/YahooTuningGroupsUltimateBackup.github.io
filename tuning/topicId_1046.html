Most of the musicians playing are &quot;amateurs&quot;<br/>in the sense that they are ordinary people playing music for Kami as<br/>he travelled through Africa. Some of the cuts are pretty interesting,<br/>a couple have some really cool rhythms, a lot are &quot;ehhh...&quot; but take a<br/>listen, and come back in a couple of days when the rest should be up.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
