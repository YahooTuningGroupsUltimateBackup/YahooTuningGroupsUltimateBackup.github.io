Or, I&apos;m not supposed to be.<br/>I guess it&apos;s been two or three months since the whole MIRACLE<br/>explosion, splinter lists, etc., drew me back.  I&apos;m glad I was<br/>able to see what it was all about!  But like I say, I&apos;m not really<br/>supposed to be here.  Other fish to fry.  Yadda, yadda.  And<br/>because of that, I&apos;m not able to give the list the attention it<br/>deserves.  Which isn&apos;t fair to my readership, if I am priveledged<br/>to have one.  So I&apos;ll take this opportunity to step out, as<br/>gracefully as I can.</p><p>I just bought two synths, which I&apos;ve been drooling over for years,<br/>as many of you on this list know... a Kurzweil K2000R and an E-mu<br/>Proteus 2000 w/Holy Grail piano.  Both of these have excellent MIDI<br/>tuning standard support, and they both sound great!  And, I got<br/>them both on ebay, for $550 and $750 respectively.  You can really<br/>get ripped-off on ebay if you&apos;re not careful... but if you are, you<br/>can score!  New Proteii and K2xxx&apos;s show up daily -- check it out!<br/>Now, to fry up some microtonal trout with these babies. . .</p><p>It&apos;s hard to justify leaving a place where historically-important<br/>microtonal guitar designs are posted daily, where guys like Robert<br/>Walker code up your ideas from across the Atlantic, and where<br/>musicians and experts from around the world work to describe ancient<br/>scales in a common language.  But, that seems to be what I&apos;m doing.</p><p>There&apos;s actually a proud tradition of list-shunning.  Daniel Wolf<br/>has done it several times... Paul Erlich at least once, Dave Keenan<br/>and now myself for our second times (no bad, Dave -- I&apos;ve been<br/>planning this for weeks!).</p><p>Nowadays, though, you&apos;ve got to say _which_ lists you&apos;re leaving.<br/>I&apos;m currently subscribed to crazy_music, tuning, tuning-math, and<br/>harmonic entropy.  I&apos;m leaving tuning and crazy_music today.  I<br/>will probably stay on tuning-math and harmonic entropy for a while,<br/>as the message volumes are much lower.  And, as always I can be<br/>reached via carl_lumma.org (with an @ instead of the _).</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/31/2001 10:59:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27703">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27703</a></p><p>&gt; There&apos;s actually a proud tradition of list-shunning.
