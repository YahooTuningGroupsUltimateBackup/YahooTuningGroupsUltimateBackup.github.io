The resulting composer&apos;s block only went away<br/>after I began exploring just-intonation.  But the scary part<br/>about it was that I was never even aware that my problem was<br/>based on my ignorance of microtonality - there was never a<br/>mention of tuning during my schooling.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3><a id=17272 href="#17272">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
