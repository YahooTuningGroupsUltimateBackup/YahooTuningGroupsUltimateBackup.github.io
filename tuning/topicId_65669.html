B-F#-C# are<br/>1/12 PC flat as in 12EDO. C#-G#-D# pure. D#-Bb-F 1/12 PC sharp to<br/>close the circle.</p><p>Easily written in cents:</p><p>C 0<br/>G 698<br/>D 196<br/>A 894<br/>E 392<br/>B 1090<br/>F# 590<br/>C# 90<br/>G# 792<br/>D# 294<br/>Bb 998<br/>F 502</p><p>Probably won&apos;t work so well for much Bach though.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
