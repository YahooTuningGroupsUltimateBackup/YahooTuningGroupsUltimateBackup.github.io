As I remember, I described my<br/>requests in numbers, and as you know I am not well seasoned in that mode.<br/>What I meant, Christopher, was two dominant seventh chords in which the<br/>third was varied between 4:5 and 7:9 while the fifth (2:3) and seventh (4:7)<br/>are constant. If the fault was mine, I apologize for the confusion and<br/>inconvenience. (On the other hand, Paul seemed to enjoy it [as did I], so it<br/>wasn&apos;t a total waste :-).</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
