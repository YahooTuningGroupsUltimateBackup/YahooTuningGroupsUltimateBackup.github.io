Anything around 116.7<br/>cents will work; the point of 3/31, 4/41 or 7/72 is that the circle<br/>of secors closes up. The point of the Golden Secor is that while it<br/>doesn&apos;t close up, it does something else interesting--the circle of<br/>secors continues in a way which makes for smooth patterns of steps,<br/>as it fits itself between the previous steps by a golden ratio<br/>division. It can also be written (3 phi + 1)/(31 phi + 10), and after<br/>completing the golden version of canasta, it fills in ten of the<br/>steps to get 41-miracle-golden, and then 31 more to get 72-miracle-<br/>golden; after which it simply keeps on going, according to the<br/>sequence 10,31,41,72,113,185...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure about all the mathematics behind this...
