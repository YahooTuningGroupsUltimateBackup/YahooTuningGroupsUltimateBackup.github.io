My question is<br/>&gt; about choice of wood for the bars.<br/>&gt; I read that pernambuco and padouk are good<br/>&gt; resonant woods but I might find these hard<br/>&gt; to come by in Scotland.<br/>&gt; What we do get is lots of Scandinavian timber.<br/>&gt; Any recommendations or is it worth trying to<br/>&gt; find the Brazilian woods?</p><p>Hi Alison!</p><p>Many years ago, I went down to the specialty<br/>lumber yard and bought some veneer sheets and<br/>planks of Brazilian Rosewood to be used in<br/>trimming and finishing a harpsichord I was making<br/>from scratch. I got some extra rosewood to make a<br/>marimba with. Not only did the rosewood have<br/>marvelous sonic properties but for years after<br/>sawing it, it exuded a fantastic intoxicating<br/>aroma. Later I returned to the lumber yard to get<br/>some more and was told that they no longer carried<br/>it because it was nearly extinct and now protected<br/>by international treaty. (I have not confirmed if<br/>that is so -- it&apos;s just what they told me.) So, in<br/>my ignorance I had the misfortune to contribute to<br/>the annihilation of this beautiful wood. And to<br/>what end? Since then I have been more cautious. So<br/>many old hardwood forests have been razed that the<br/>timber companies are now flattening South Pacific<br/>islands, taking every tree, leaving the islands<br/>permanently destroyed and uninhabitable. But the<br/>islanders don&apos;t care -- they&apos;ve all become<br/>millionaires and can afford to relocate. Living on<br/>a beautiful unspoilt island was a boring drag<br/>anyway!</p><p>Now I think you should ultimately do what you<br/>want, and that making musical instruments out of<br/>rare wood with fabulous acoustical properties is<br/>certainly more justifiable than using that same<br/>wood to make disposable toothpicks and cheap<br/>jewelry boxes.</p><p>But I see that you are from Scotland, the land of<br/>proud self-reliance. I live in the Appalachian<br/>foothills which resembles Scotland in some ways<br/>and probably explains why so many people of Scotch<br/>ancestry settled this familiar-looking rugged<br/>land. These old-timers around here would rather<br/>die than buy something they could make themselves,<br/>which is practically a sin to them. The best<br/>sounding banjars are made of maple taken from<br/>trees they cut themselves, and stretched with the<br/>hide of a groundhog or a cat. The most talented of<br/>the locals play &quot;every note in tune&quot; cos those<br/>banjars ain&apos;t got no frets.</p><p>My personal lifestyle choice at this stage of my<br/>life is to maintain authenticity and live and<br/>create in harmony with my environment. Thus, I<br/>grow my own food, have my own fluoride &amp; chlorine<br/>free well water, milk my own goats for naturally<br/>homogenized steroid-free milk, and eat brown and<br/>green eggs laid by my free-ranging chickens. Also,<br/>I don&apos;t eat fresh strawberries in the dead of the<br/>winter, trying to maintain harmony with the<br/>rhythms of the seasons. I also build my own<br/>fences, write my own music, create my own scales,<br/>develop my own tuning software and 3D audio<br/>algorithms and even on occasion design my own<br/>Digital Synthesis Engine ASICs.</p><p>I keep the heat low in winter and use fans rather<br/>than air-conditioners in the summer. Yes, perhaps<br/>some part of me would enjoy going to the opera and<br/>sipping cappuccino at a sidewalk cafe in San Jose.<br/>But that would be a denial of the spirits of my<br/>ancestors and the potentiality of my descendants.</p><p>I believe that I am creating authenticity to my<br/>culture (as well as being descended through my<br/>mother from the hyper-self-reliant Thomas<br/>Jefferson and his Nubian mistress Sally Hemings, I<br/>am Kiowa Indian through my father) through these<br/>actions and that by doing so I am choosing<br/>resonation rather than resistance with my life<br/>path.</p><p>So, the next time I make a marimba, I am going to<br/>try using cherry wood from prunings in my cherry<br/>orchard -- and if that doesn&apos;t give the sound I am<br/>looking for, I will try one of the cedars or<br/>pines. What I am saying is that. yes you _can_<br/>make a wonderful instrument from a beautiful tree<br/>cut down literally on the other side of the<br/>planet. You can travel 100 miles per hour in your<br/>car and you can eat fresh strawberries imported<br/>from New Zealand or Brazil on the coldest day of<br/>the year. But that is not the only choice. An<br/>instrument made not only by your own hand but from<br/>materials from your own environment will sound<br/>beyond its resonator and move in unison with your<br/>spirit.</p><p>As a final thought, I leave you with the words of<br/>Bart Hopkins:</p><p>&quot;The most highly prized xylophones are made with<br/>dense tropical hardwoods. For this plan I have<br/>suggested making the bars of redwood, simply<br/>because it is one of the better-sounding among<br/>widely available and affordable temperate woods.<br/>It also is easy to work and not prone to<br/>splitting; it looks nice and ages well. You may<br/>choose to use some other wood, and perhaps you<br/>will come across one with a truly superior tone.<br/>If you do use another wood, your bar lengths for<br/>given pitches may be well out of agreement with<br/>the approximate lengths given in Figure 2.<br/>Whatever you use, be sure that your wood is<br/>kiln-dried or otherwise well-seasoned. Look for<br/>straight, close grain, particularly on the broad<br/>face of the bar, and avoid knotty wood, or discard<br/>knotty sections when making the bars.&quot; - Bart<br/>Hopkins, &quot;Making Simple Musical Instruments&quot;<br/>(1995, Lark Books, Asheville)</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/18/2001 12:15:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Alison!<br/>&gt;     I don&apos;t know of any Scandinavian hardwoods that are good for<br/>&gt; marimbas.

The bars of the Diamond Marimba, Bass Marimba, Marimba Eroica<br/>and Quadrangularis Reversum all has a finish coat of some kind. I<br/>will contact Danlee Mitchell to see if he remembers the exact<br/>forumla/substance, but knowing Partch&apos;s funding, it may certainly<br/>have varied over the years, according to what he could get his hands<br/>on.</p><p>For a lot of good general purpose info on bar making, &quot;Genesis of a<br/>Music&quot; does include a lot, so this may be of help to Allison. Also,<br/>if one were to make *low* range wooden bar instruments, I can say<br/>authoritatively (from playing on the Bass Marimba for years) that the<br/>softer woods work well in those situations, not having to absorb<br/>blows from small, hard mallets. But for normal, mid- to high-range<br/>mariimbas, a harder impact/vibrating material is essential. Difficult<br/>in these days of resource depletion.</p><p>(and to think: Scotland, the island deforested those many centuries<br/>ago.

They&apos;re also quite dense, certainly<br/>attractive and rather expensive (a bit of conjecture: they might be more<br/>uniform in tensile properties and grain orientation because of their<br/>density). Brazilian Rosewood hasn&apos;t been imported legally to the States<br/>since 1991.</p><p>I don&apos;t make percussion instruments, though I imagine any wood with<br/>reasonably low damping could make a fine marimba. I prefer using<br/>domestic wood species that don&apos;t see much commercial use, but I recycle<br/>a lot of stuff, too (hi, Kraig!) - here are some ideas. Boxwood and<br/>Lilac are nearly as dense as the SA species, but they tend to be small<br/>and are difficult to season; Beech and denser Hornbeam and Dogwood might<br/>be nice if a little unstable with humidity. Old North American Red Birch<br/>is great stuff, but Yellow and Baltic stuff seems spongier. Sycamore<br/>Maple...Apple, Cherry, Pear...Oak...I don&apos;t know anything about Oak.<br/>What about Scotch Pine? The examples I&apos;ve seen have been as hard as the<br/>American Yellow Pines get. I gather it isn&apos;t harvested much anymore like<br/>most UK woods but maybe you can find some smaller old pieces.</p><p>You might try checking out the Musical Instrument Makers Forum at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.mimf.com/">http://www.mimf.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2001 2:32:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Absolutely millions of thanks for the advice and insights Kraig and<br/>y&apos;all. You are quite right about the environment Jeff. (I imagine<br/>someone hunched over his methane - powered email machine). I was more<br/>than a little concerned about the environmental implications of using<br/>some of the exotic woods, and the holistic ideals of using what you have<br/>around and within resonate deeply with my own ideals (pun intended). I<br/>reckon also that playing music inspired by the landscape and culture<br/>around you on an instrument made as far as possible with local materials<br/>could add spiritual depth to performances, certainly in terms of<br/>audience interest.</p><p>Jon asked about reforestation in Scotland. Yes, the Caledonian Forest<br/>has been on the agenda for some years now and great efforts are under<br/>way to reforest large areas of the West and the Borders where I now<br/>live. As regards music, a fiddle maker, or should I say violin maker<br/>from the North East has been receiving rave reviews for his instruments,<br/>some of which are being hailed as qualitatively up there with the<br/>Strads. I&apos;d like to check if he uses Scottish timber.</p><p>As for links between Celtic music and other ethnic musics, the Hebridean<br/>waulking songs (songs sung in the past by women as they treated their<br/>woven cloth with sheep urine by the way) are virtually indistinguishable<br/>from some North American and Far Eastern tribal chants and would be a<br/>fertile field for microtonal study. These ladies did not sing in 12 tet.<br/>And Scottish fiddlers can get radically microtonal - especially after a<br/>few drams of uisce - another unexplored field of serious study (the<br/>fiddling rather than the drinking).</p><p>Thanks again for the replies to my request.</p></div><h3>Bill Alves &#x3C;ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2001 3:32:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt;Also, John Schneider, whose is part of MicroFest and will be putting<br/>&gt;on a Partch Centennial at UCLA on May 26, has recently had a new<br/>&gt;Diamond Marimba built for him (I believe it was two *different*<br/>&gt;people that worked on the project), and he may have information on<br/>&gt;the above matters.</p><p>John Schneider will be performing the same concert at the MicroFest<br/>conference on Friday night, April 6.

I believe he did most of the work at Lou Harrison&apos;s<br/>place in Aptos (perhaps in Bill Colvig&apos;s workshop?). Bill Slye has built<br/>his own JI marimba as part of a thesis at UC Santa Cruz, and it was played<br/>at MicroFest last year. When building it, he went to great lengths to tune<br/>the partials of each individual bar to JI (i.e. harmonics) insofaras is<br/>possible. I&apos;m pretty sure he did the same with the diamond marimba.</p><p>Bill has told me that he considers the tuning of partials crucial and, like<br/>William Sethares, was implicitly critical of the point of view voiced by<br/>Kraig here and followed by myself and Lou that JI on idiophones can be<br/>effective even with non-harmonic partials, especially when &quot;helmholtz&quot;<br/>resonators are used. In any case, I greatly respect Bill&apos;s craftsmanship<br/>and composing, I&apos;m sure that he would be a great resource to anyone<br/>considering the construction of a marimba.
