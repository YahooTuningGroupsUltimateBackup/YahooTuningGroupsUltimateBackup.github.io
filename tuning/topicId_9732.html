I am either in tune or out of tune and there are such a thing as &apos;bad intonation days.&apos;</p><p>Aside from consonance/dissonance there is the issue of expression -- a sharp major second can go a long way making Bartok sound like Bartok.</p><p>Could there be a family of issues that fall under the rubric of intonation?  We have the inherent nature of the intervals,  we have expression((para)linguistic mimesis),  Compromise with other musicians, instruments. Cultural conditioning?</p><p>I remember once practicing my cello at college, I was working on the 2 mvt of Brahms&apos; sonata in E minor. A friend who happened to be from Nepal heard me play and  commented that I was out of tune.  I was indignant but he was probably right. I was playing the pitches accurately as notated and he grew up listening to his Indian music. The cello part of the Sonata is not meant to stand alone-- without the harmonic underpining or a tacit understanding of the harmony, the piece doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>I am curious if there are any microtonal analysis of cellist or violinists playing Bach unaccompianied. I suspect that the musician works out a &quot;temperment&quot; unique to the music different perhaps than the temperments we find ossified in keyboards.</p></div><h3>John Thaden &#x3C;jjthaden@flash.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2000 9:23:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I am curious if there are any<br/>&gt;microtonal analysis  of cellist or violinists playing Bach unaccompianied.<br/>&gt;I suspect that the  musician works out a &quot;temperment&quot; unique to the music<br/>&gt;different perhaps than the  temperments we find ossified in keyboards.</p><p>I hear hours of unaccompanied cello and violin (and contrabass!) in a<br/>month, those being faves of my wife.  I haven&apos;t measured, but to my ears,<br/>the intonation is clearly not 12TET.  Violins and cellos are tuned to<br/>perfect fifths, after all, and like singers, string players are free to<br/>sweeten those intervals as called for.</p><p>John Thaden<br/>Little Rock, Arkansas, USA<br/><a href="http://www.flash.net/~jjthaden">http://www.flash.net/~jjthaden</a></p></div>
