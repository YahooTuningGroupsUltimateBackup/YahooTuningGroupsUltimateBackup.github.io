A different tonal centre, but the same tonal type, such as F major;<br/>&gt; 2. The same tonal centre, but a different tonal type, which is c minor;<br/>&gt; 3. A different tonal centre and a different tonal type, such as f minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what I contend is that modulation in the above sense does not<br/>&gt; exist in Indian music. I stand corrected if the term &apos;modulation&apos; does<br/>&gt; not mean what I think it means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Carl remarked, your interpretation of the usage of &apos;modulation&apos; is<br/>&gt; perhaps different from the above. Can you please tell me more about this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks and regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For the love of Allah, will no one condone the usage of the term<br/>&gt; modulation as this poor soul imagines it to be?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. As traditionally rendered, Hindustani music contains absolutely<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no modulation.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ozan, given this information, do you still consider Hindustani music<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be a form of Maqam music?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think Haresh was using the same meaning of the term<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;modulation&quot; as Ozan was.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2006 4:28:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>very subversive :)<br/>&gt; Message: 8         &gt;    Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2006 15:09:37 -0500 (EST)<br/>&gt;    From: Christopher Bailey &lt;<a href="mailto:chris@music.columbia.edu">chris@music.columbia.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: modulation in Indian Music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I heard that recently, some practitioners (I think this is only in &gt; Hindustani music) have begun the practice of:  suddenly, in the middle of &gt; one raga,  provide a brief &quot;window&quot; into another raga,  just for a few &gt; seconds.
