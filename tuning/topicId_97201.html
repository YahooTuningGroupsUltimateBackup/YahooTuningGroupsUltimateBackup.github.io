I haven&apos;t played it, but here it is.</p><p>The basic idea is that..<br/>The difference between a JI fifth and a 12edo fifth is the pyth. comma / 12<br/>= circa 1.95500c<br/>The difference between a 12 edo fifth and the octave is 500c.<br/>256 * 1.95500c = circa 500.48c.<br/>In 12edo with C tonic, 256 stacked JI fifths would equal an octave-congruent<br/>E+500.48c, i.e. basically an A (the relative minor tonic if C is in the<br/>major key).<br/>A 10-note scale was constructed with tonic and pitches<br/>f = (3/2)^(2^k) for k=0..8<br/>given within the octave.</p><p>In cents, this gives 0 and<br/>203.91<br/>407.82<br/>431.28<br/>525.12<br/>701.96<br/>815.64<br/>862.56<br/>900.48<br/>1050.24</p></div>
