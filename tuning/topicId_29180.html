I might lean toward 1/4-comma<br/>with pure 5:4 major thirds, which is what Pietro Aron appears to<br/>suggest in 1523, not excluding some scope for &quot;irregularities&quot;<br/>(e.g. some fifths maybe closer to 2/7-comma, or 1/5-comma?).</p><p>Since Zarlino, in 1558, is the first to define such a tuning in<br/>precise mathematical terms (2/7-comma), the evidence concerning<br/>earlier meantones is more qualitative than quantitative, so to speak.</p><p>When Aron recommends tuning the major third C-E as &quot;sonorous and just&quot;<br/>as possible, making the interval a &quot;unity,&quot; a pure ratio of 5:4 seems<br/>suggested, certainly supporting although not specifically mandating a<br/>tuning of the type later termed &quot;1/4-comma.&quot;</p><p>Some other sources, such as Schlick (1511) and Lanfranco (1533),<br/>suggest a kind of meantone where the major thirds are somewhat wider<br/>than just, maybe around 1/5-comma.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s choice of 2/7-comma in 1558 might suggest that tunings of<br/>this kind, with major thirds narrower than just and minor thirds<br/>closer to just, may have also had some currency in previous decades.</p><p>If in doubt, I might go with 1/4-comma for Sermisy, but you might want<br/>to experiment with other meantone tunings -- and, as Lindley says, we<br/>should not assume that early 16th-century tuners generally aimed at<br/>absolute regularity.</p><p>As Lindley comments, 2/7-comma might be especially pleasing for some<br/>pieces with a slower kind of texture, generally, and lots of<br/>sonorities with minor thirds above the lowest part, as with some later<br/>16th-century keyboard music from Venice.</p><p>He finds 1/5-comma &quot;sprightly&quot; for certain English pieces around 1600<br/>where there&apos;s lots of melodic motion, since the diatonic semitones are<br/>a bit narrower.</p><p>In the 16th century, at least, meantone seems an obvious general<br/>choice for most repertories. Now we come to the trickier matter of the<br/>15th century, where there&apos;s lots of room for differing opinions.</p><p>For the early Dufay epoch, say 1420-1440, I might ideally recommend<br/>the model of a 17-note Pythagorean tuning (Gb-A#), with Gb-G# as the<br/>most frequently used part of this range.</p><p>The basic idea is to have a choice for sonorities with thirds<br/>involving sharps of either a usual active Pythagorean form of these<br/>intervals (e.g. A3-C#4-F#4 before G3-D4-G4 in a cadence), or the<br/>&quot;schisma&quot; form with ratios very close to a simple 5:4 or 6:5<br/>(e.g. A3-Db4-E4 for a prolonged noncadential sonority written as<br/>A3-C#4-E4).</p><p>This approach calls for lots of judgment: sometimes you may have to<br/>decide both whether an accidental inflection not present in a<br/>manuscript itself should be added -- e.g. A3-F4 or A3-F[#]4 -- and, if<br/>so, whether to take the inflection as A3-F#4 (usual Pythagorean major<br/>sixth) or A3-Gb4 (Pythagorean diminished seventh, ~5:3). You can take<br/>editorial accidentals as one guide to the first kind of question, your<br/>mileage varying with the editor&apos;s taste &lt;grin&gt;, but still have the<br/>second kind of question to deal with.</p><p>Here I sometimes have curious intuitions. For example, a sonority with<br/>a major tenth like D3-A3-F#4 might especially invite a schisma third<br/>(D3-A3-Gb4) in order to get a &quot;sweet&quot; near 5:2 between the outer<br/>voices.</p><p>Here I&apos;m assuming a fixed-pitch instrument that can tune at least 15<br/>or so notes per octave (D# and A# seem to me a bit less important for<br/>most of this music, with the pairs C#/Db, F#/Gb, and G#/Ab the most<br/>important ones for this kind of choice).</p><p>Thus when a cadence combines the usual 14th-century motions of major<br/>third to fifth and major sixth to octave, I would be inclined to<br/>regular Pythagorean thirds and sixths. For prolonged noncadential<br/>thirds with written sharps, or also cadential sonorities with an outer<br/>major tenth or the like, I might lean toward the near-pure schisma<br/>thirds.</p><p>With a 12-note instrument, a simpler system is generally the Gb-B<br/>tuning, with the Pythagorean &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; between B and Gb. As long as<br/>a piece doesn&apos;t rely on the fifth B-F# -- often not used in music of<br/>this era -- this popular keyboard tuning should give a nice contrast<br/>between these varieties of thirds, although &quot;automatically&quot; rather<br/>than as an exercise of calculated discretion.</p><p>As we move to around 1450, conventional wisdom tends to favor<br/>meantone: as Lindley notes, this would include the later Dufay and<br/>Ockeghem. However, there has recently been a tendency among some late<br/>15th-century music lovers to favor Pythagorean for certain styles,<br/>including some of the intricate polyphony of Ockeghem.</p><p>Here the argument is that the melodic features of the music might<br/>often favor a traditional Pythagorean approach, although this can be<br/>in tension with some of the vertical traits. Curiously, there&apos;s an<br/>intonational fine point here to consider.</p><p>Clearly the meantone sonority with major third below and minor third<br/>above (near-4:5:6, approximating a rounded 0-386-702 cents,<br/>e.g. 0-386-697 in 1/4-comma) is much smoother in usual timbres than<br/>the Pythagorean version at 64:81:96 (0-408-702 cents). By the early<br/>16th century, say the epoch around 1520, this sonority is more and<br/>more definitively setting the standard of musical euphony.</p><p>However, for the arrangement with minor third below major third, the<br/>meantone rendering of thirds near 6:5 and 5:4 (0-310-697 cents in<br/>1/4-comma) might not be much more stable than the Pythagorean thirds<br/>at 32:27 and 81:64 (0-294-702 cents).</p><p>From a later perspective, the Pythagorean tuning of 54:64:81 is<br/>actually not that far from 16:19:24 (0-298-702 cents), a form where<br/>the &quot;rootedness&quot; and difference tones may give the sonority a special<br/>stability.</p><p>Thus while meantone, by around 1480, may have been the prevailing<br/>choice for keyboards, it is quite possible that singers were still<br/>influenced by more Pythagorean habits, with the increasing<br/>predominance of sonorities with _major_ thirds above the bass by<br/>around 1520 making a meantone or 5-limit paradigm more generally<br/>applicable.</p><p>One possible line of evidence here is that around 1500, when closing<br/>sonorities with thirds become common in the vocal pieces of composers<br/>such as Josquin and Isaac, often they involve minor thirds above the<br/>bass, likely without the kind of performers&apos; alterations to major<br/>thirds which may have been an increasingly common practice by around<br/>1523 or 1525, when Aron documents such tendencies.</p><p>For a fixed-pitch instrument, I might still lean toward meantone by<br/>the Josquin-Isaac period; I mention this point only to note that<br/>current views are mixed. For a vocal ensemble, of course, some kind of<br/>adaptive tuning leaning toward Pythagorean melodic steps, but with<br/>adjustments to get &quot;meantone-like&quot; sonorities with major thirds above<br/>the bass, could be an optimal strategy.</p><p>An interesting implication of this kind of recent view is that the<br/>continued use of Pythagorean paradigms in theory around 1480-1520,<br/>although sometimes with mention of the fact that keyboard instruments<br/>are no longer tuned in this way, could reflect an element of vocal<br/>practice as well as conceptual conservatism.</p><p>If the ideal tuning in vocal music for a conclusive sonority with<br/>minor third below major third around 1500 is indeed near 16:19:24,<br/>then a Pythagorean model might serve some vertical as well as melodic<br/>features of the music, given the adaptive potential for leaning toward<br/>a 4:5:6 ratio for the converse arrangement with major third below.</p><p>To sum up, the later 15th century, if I might borrow a phrase from<br/>Scottish-English history, is a &quot;debatable land&quot; for Pythagorean and<br/>meantone. Meantone keyboards, and vocal practices sometimes leaning in<br/>either direction, are one kind of rough impression.</p><p>I would still say that meantone for the Ockeghem-Josquin-Isaac era<br/>seems the &quot;safest&quot; choice: keyboard instruments would have likely been<br/>tuned in this way. However, it is not the only possible alternative,<br/>especially for flexible-pitch ensembles.</p><p>Similarly, while some kind of modified or flexible Pythagorean seems<br/>to me indicated for the early Dufay era, the possibility of a more<br/>&quot;5-limit&quot; kind of tuning shouldn&apos;t be excluded. English ensembles may<br/>have leaned toward this kind of tuning.</p><p>If an early 15th-century piece has lots of traditional 14th-century<br/>cadences with major thirds expanding to fifths as well as major sixths<br/>to octaves, then I would be drawn to Pythagorean. Also, fauxbourdon<br/>(parallel sixth sonorities punctuated here and there by such cadences)<br/>can be very pleasant in Pythagorean, as Mark Lindley notes. Here the<br/>many thirds and sixths are points of motion or &quot;floating&quot; rather than<br/>solidity.</p><p>If it has a more &quot;static&quot; tertian sound, like some of Dunstable&apos;s<br/>motets, where a more &quot;solid&quot; kind of sound for the sonorities with<br/>thirds might be desired in at least one type of interpretation, then a<br/>&quot;5-limit&quot; kind of approximation might not be out of place.</p><p>In other words, along with the general advice &quot;Pythagorean to around<br/>1450, and meantone from there on,&quot; I&apos;d like to stress that there is<br/>much room for choice.</p><p>In approaching some early 16th-century lute music, where meantone,<br/>Pythagorean, or equal semitones are all possibilities, Mark Lindley<br/>takes the approach of playing the piece and drawing conclusions from<br/>that. Getting to know the music in the &quot;historically likely&quot; keyboard<br/>tunings or similar systems, but with lots of experimentation when it<br/>seems attractive, can help in making more informed decisions.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
