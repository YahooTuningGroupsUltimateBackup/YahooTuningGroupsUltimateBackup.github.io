Then have an expansive beta testing phase,<br/>&gt; where all the things you never dreamed could happen DO happen.<br/>&gt; And somewhere along that phase, *then* you can start telling<br/>&gt; people, with a reasonsable expectation of both features and<br/>&gt; availability, just how much of _all_ your product can produce.<br/>&gt; Otherwise you might as well call it TonalLimp!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want a very good example of a software product that<br/>&gt; has been handled in a similar vein to what I describe, look<br/>&gt; at AudioMulch:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.audiomulch.com/">http://www.audiomulch.com/</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mulch-discuss/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mulch-discuss/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon (whose emphasis in his Software Engineering degree was<br/>&gt; - you guessed it - QA...)</p><p>thanks for the thoughtful comments.  you&apos;re right, and<br/>believe it or not i really *am* trying to keep a low<br/>profile on this until we actually do release it.<br/>i just get a little enthusiastic sometimes.  :)</p><p>maybe all i should really emphasize is that the Tonalsoft<br/>sequencer is being built with tuning choices available<br/>right from the beginning ... tuning considerations are<br/>an integral part of the app&apos;s framework, and indeed, the<br/>tuning stuff is for the first release is already finished,<br/>and it&apos;s the first part of the app that we *have* finished.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2003 7:09:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kurt,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I hope the [Tonalsoft] software is written in a way<br/>&gt; that makes it easy to port to another platform.  (Hint hint)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what were your plans for eventual Mac suppport?  I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; find the info, though I seem to recall you having mentioned<br/>&gt; it once.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Kurt</p><p>sorry.  somewhat to my own chagrin, we&apos;ve gone Microsoft<br/>all the way.  our framework requires .net and direct-x.</p><p>no plans for Mac support any time soon ... hopefully<br/>eventually we&apos;ll do it for a future release.  but the<br/>short answer is: if you want to use our software, you&apos;ll<br/>need a Windows machine.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
