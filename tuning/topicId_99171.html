Easy to find for me.  They groove into the silence &amp; stillness... meaning it&apos;s easy to find the right exact pitch from ear - with Guidance on - meaning I do a lot of Qi practices - and use my ear along with tuning spectrum enhancements, imbedded inside of each chakra...<br/>Pretty far out, until you do a lot of Qi Gong - and understand things differently.  I&apos;ve got to get this out there - makes hearing the pitches stunningly more easy - hope to find a synth to practice with, so I can approximate less and key in on the rhythmics to drone over more - and get exact with perfection of pitch remembrance, what number correspondences I&apos;m getting when my throat chakra spins out these cool grooves I&apos;ve been recording.  Hope so that we can all groove together online, pass files back &amp; forth and see what&apos;s up.  Or record live in person.  Recording these grooves daily.  Hit it up with me soon to hear some of them - microtonal Hip Bop - Jazzified classics of the new groove.<br/>Peaceful &amp; remaxed upward in energy - vibes of positivity and grace.<br/>Hope to hear you all soon - Cipher it up with me any day.<br/>Peace!</p><p>Best synth out there?
