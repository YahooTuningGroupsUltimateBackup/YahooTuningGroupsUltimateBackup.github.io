They all allow any<br/>indigenous<br/>&gt; &gt; interval to be played in either direction from any indigenous<br/>pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for that info, but are they capable of scalar inversions.</p><p>Of course they are.</p><p>&gt; To me,<br/>&gt; that is the most structurally important specificity of a EDO tuning<br/>&gt; system, which I&apos;ll explain my rationale for later.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing special about ETs on the inversional angle as far as<br/>I can see.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The difference is that among these tuning systems, only equal<br/>tunings<br/>&gt; &gt; HAVE A FINITE NUMBER OF PITCHES PER OCTAVE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I guess I see, but I don&apos;t think I completely understand what<br/>you<br/>&gt; mean here.</p><p>If you&apos;re going to be engaged in the process of transposing intervals<br/>to different pitches, meantone, JI, and such tunings have no limits<br/>upon the number of different pitches (per octave) that may need to be<br/>added as a result of this process. This is not the case for equal<br/>temperaments, where the limit is just the number of pitches (per<br/>octave) in the tuning itself.</p></div><h3>Bill Flavell &#x3C;bill_flavell@email.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2005 7:57:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes why pay attention to acoustical phenomenon when we can create<br/>&gt; conceptional construction on paper and not have to pay attention to<br/>&gt; sound at all.</p><p>Well, I wouldn&apos;t go that far, Kraig, but I certainly<br/>don&apos;t think that the current &quot;scientific&quot; understanding<br/>of sound/acoustics is any where near correct.
