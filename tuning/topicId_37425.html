I was not<br/>grossly inacurate but in fact the pitch discrimination is a bit worse<br/>that what I said. It is 1.8 Hz up to 500 Hz, then 0.35%. In my<br/>arguments, I tried to pull the figures as far as possible in the<br/>&quot;good&quot; direction (in your sense) to show that even being very<br/>optimistic, 0.1 cent is unrealistic.</p><p>The experiments described in &quot;Das Ohr Als Nachrichetenempf&auml;nger&quot; by<br/>Zwicker and Feldtkeller (an extremely comprehensive book on<br/>psychoaccoustic that I fortunately have in French translation) try to<br/>explore the pitch discrimination in its most fundamental aspects. The<br/>pitch discrimination experiment is made by modulating a frequency<br/>between F and F+deltaF and determine the threshold for a noticeable<br/>modulation. The threshold (deltaF) depends on many parameters:<br/>- The frequency F.<br/>- The modulation frequency Fm<br/>- The accoustic level (in dB)<br/>The pitch discrimination is best for Fm around 4Hz. The figures of<br/>1.8Hz, 0.35% are measured for optimal level and Fm.<br/>The experiment results are probably as near as it is possible of the<br/>actual properties of the inner ear. I personnaly think that training<br/>may improve pitch perception but certainly by less than an order of<br/>magnitude, as we are here, bound to physiological limits.</p><p>I once tought that is was possible for the brain to take benefit of<br/>higher harmonics to improve frequency resolution.<br/>Rereading those figures, are must admit that I was wrong as long as<br/>the RELATIVE frequency resolution (in % OR in cents) is fairly<br/>constant above 500 Hz: thus if the resolution is N cents at 440 Hz, it<br/>remains (at most) N cents at 880 Hz, 1320 Hz.</p><p>Obviously, those figures are for melodic pitch discrimination. But I<br/>think that they are as near as possible as the physiological pitch<br/>discrimination limits.</p><p>&gt; Paul :<br/>&gt; zithers are not fretted instruments.</p><p>I must admit that I am totally ignorant of zithern that I confused<br/>with cithern (an early fretted instrument). Are its strings plucked,<br/>hit or bowed ?</p><p>&gt; Paul:<br/>&gt; sorry, francois, that figure is not applicable here. that&apos;s the<br/>&gt; *melodic* just noticeable difference. by eliminating beats, though,<br/>&gt; one can tune *harmonic* intervals FAR more accurately than this. one<br/>&gt; can easily reduce the rate of beating between high-order harmonics<br/>to<br/>&gt; 1 per 10 seconds, 1 per 15 seconds -- you do the math.</p><p>OK Paul I do the math:</p><p>In any cases, the harmonic aproximation cannot hold if we talk about<br/>0.1 cents precision, so Paul is absolutely correct to question the<br/>tuning of inharmonic string. The harmonic approximation supposes<br/>(among other things) that the variation of the string length is<br/>neglectible during its oscillation. Let say that that the rest string<br/>length is L and the amplitude of vibration is A. In first<br/>approximation, at maximum amplitude, the lenght of the string is<br/>longer by some deltaL with deltaL/L ~= (A/L)**2. This is fairly<br/>neglectible when reasonable precision is required. For reasonable L =<br/>500mm, A = 5mm, we get deltaL/L = 0.01 %: which is above the claimed<br/>precision of 0.006 % (0.1 cents). For elementary physic reasons, 0.1<br/>cents does not make sense for string tuning.</p><p>Further, I doubt that if ever this precision could ever be reached,<br/>any stringed instrument can hold it for more than a few minutes (or<br/>more reasonably a few seconds) when played.</p><p>OK let&apos;s admit that I am all wrong because I am considering melodic<br/>pitch. Let&apos;s now consider harmonic relationship of the simplest case:<br/>slightly out of tune unison of two notes F and F + deltaF. It is<br/>correct that the beat frequencies is increased as long is it is given<br/>by the difference in frequency. for F0, beat is at deltaF, for F1, it<br/>is 2*deltaF and so on. Overtone amplify the beat frequency, so that<br/>0.006 % difference is made a 0.6 Hz beat at 10 KHz: that is not much<br/>but that is something. But we are there at least on the 20th harmonics<br/>for any note in mid range: that is faint (if perceptible) and masked.<br/>Further the amplitude of 10th+ harmonics depends nearly ramdomly on<br/>where the string is plucked, hit, bowed.</p><p>For 0.1 cents on unison, beat period vary from 40 seconds (~440 Hz) to<br/>2 seconds (~10KHz) that is not much, If the string is hit or plucked,<br/>that may affect very slightly the enveloppe of the note decay.</p><p>If the string is anything but bowed (to produce a stationary tone)<br/>effect of the decay adds on with the long period harmonic beat and<br/>various phase effects in a way that cannot be untangled. I hearsay<br/>that the three strings of piano midrange notes may be slightly out of<br/>tune to have a &quot;rounder&quot; decay (is that true??). At this level, taking<br/>into account the inharmonicity, justness is no more a quantitative<br/>measure, it is a matter of taste.</p><p>On one hand side I cannot honestly deny that those higher harmonics<br/>effect exists (if tiny) and may be perceived (if only by gifted,<br/>highly trained expert).</p><p>On the other hand side, I am totally convinced that those who sell<br/>electronic tuners claiming 0.1 cent precision are incompetent crooks<br/>and that such precision does not make sense for signal analysis theory<br/>viewpoint, from an elementary physics viewpoint and from a<br/>physiological viewpoint.</p><p>&gt; Graham:<br/>&gt; My ears disagree with you, and I trust my ears more than academic<br/>&gt; journals.  Have you ever tried tuning sawtooth wave dyads yourself?</p><p>I do not trust my ears, they were proven quite lousy with the<br/>&quot;jerries&quot; :-(. No I never tried, but I can guess that sawtooth is<br/>easier to tune to a given precision than accoustic instrument, because<br/>its spectrum is nearly flat (little or no higher harmonics decay) and<br/>because those pegs never get loose :-).</p><p>&gt; Graham:<br/>&gt; It may be a matter of debate that the human brain can work around<br/>it, but<br/>&gt; we know electronics can.  Robert Walker&apos;s got good results from a<br/>zero<br/>&gt; point crossing algorithm.  The tuner could be doing the same thing.<br/>The<br/>&gt; important fact is that it&apos;s only guessing the pitch of one note.<br/>The<br/>&gt; uncertainty principle you mention is for picking a frequency<br/>component out<br/>&gt; against background noise, not a single note in isolation.</p><p>I have discussed this point with Robert Walker on this list and<br/>concluded that it was possible to take benefit of the higher harmonics<br/>for enhanced pitch estimation, without anyhow contradict signal theory<br/>or more specifically the &quot;uncertainty principle&quot;.

I am<br/>happy to leave it to you to add these, but I&apos;d prefer if you didn&apos;t<br/>imply that I&apos;d forgotten about them. Or that it was &quot;beneath me&quot;.

I agree that they should be<br/>suited for falacious claim :-).</p><p>I still believe that 0.1 cents does not make sense on the tuning, as<br/>long as I perhaps rely on a quite (too) strict acceptance of &quot;tuning&quot;.<br/>In my mind, mere concept of tuning is based on the assumption that the<br/>instrument we tune has evenly distributed harmonics. This is true for<br/>strings, bells, pipes etc. this is true, yes, but up to a certain<br/>limits, limits in string tension, air flow and pressure and precision<br/>required. As I stated in previous post requiring 0.1 ~ 0.006 % places<br/>us way out of the harmonicity limit for a physical string:</p><p>I wrote :<br/>&gt; In any cases, the harmonic aproximation cannot hold if we talk about<br/>&gt; 0.1 cents precision, so Paul is absolutely correct to question the<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; of inharmonic string. The harmonic approximation supposes (among<br/>other<br/>&gt; things) that the variation of the string length is neglectible<br/>during its<br/>&gt; oscillation. Let say that that the rest string length is L and the<br/>amplitude<br/>&gt; of vibration is A. In first approximation, at maximum amplitude, the<br/>lenght<br/>&gt; of the string is longer by some deltaL with deltaL/L ~= (A/L)**2.<br/>This is<br/>&gt; fairly neglectible when reasonable precision is required. For<br/>reasonable<br/>&gt; L = 500mm, A = 5mm, we get deltaL/L = 0.01 %: which is above the<br/>claimed<br/>&gt; precision of 0.006 % (0.1 cents). For elementary physic reasons, 0.1<br/>cents<br/>&gt; does not make sense for string tuning.</p><p>being out of the harmonic limit, this means that</p><p>- Harmonic F(N) is not accurately N * F0 (it is slightly smaller that<br/>an amount probably more than 0.006 %)<br/>- F0 depends on the amplitute of vibration with a variation which is<br/>more than 0.006 %</p><p>This is like the period of pendulum that is fairly constant given that<br/>amplitude is small and that you are not too much demanding on<br/>accuracy.</p><p>We can make a tought experiment in which measurement accuracy is not a<br/>problem. For instance, instead of dumbly recording the sound we will<br/>use an ultra rapid camera to take a movie of the string with one<br/>million images per second plugged to a microscope that can record<br/>string position with a precision of one atom.</p><p>We pluck the string in such a clever way that we are not bothered by<br/>upper harmonics, and see what happen. At the begining, the string<br/>moves at, let say 439.95 Hz, then, as amplitude goes down, frequency<br/>goes to an asymptotic limit of 440.00 Hz. The pitch goes up during the<br/>decay. In fact, this is quite common sense to think that a longer<br/>trajectory takes more time than shorter ones.</p><p>This is a tought experiment, but give an insight on what occurs in<br/>&quot;reality&quot;.</p><p>Some other acoustic devices may be more linear than string but I doubt<br/>so. Further 0.006 % implies more than five digits (linear) precision<br/>that is hardly reached for any kind of commonplace measurement or<br/>mecanical device.</p><p>So even if we admit that 0.1 cent measurable (I don&apos;t), that is way<br/>out of the harmonicity limits where precision of the tuning has any<br/>meaning for acoustical musical instruments.</p><p>It is not impossible a 0.006% &quot;detuning&quot; of a dyad may be audible. But<br/>as the beat period of higher harmonics is (at best) of the same order<br/>of magnitude as the decay period, it is not, strictly speaking<br/>&quot;tuning&quot;, but more &quot;enveloppe shaping&quot;.</p><p>I must admit that this distinction between &quot;tuning&quot; and &quot;enveloppe<br/>shaping&quot; is of no musical relevance. As I must admit that<br/>psycoaccoustic is absolutely not necessary to any musical creation or<br/>experience. I just personaly think that it is fun to try to understand<br/>relationship between what is perceived and what exists, and try to<br/>understand the limits of applicability of ANY theory or system.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3><a id=37712 href="#37712">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2002 12:38:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;francois_laferriere&quot; &lt;francois.laferriere@o...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; First, I want to apologiged if I have been anyhow vexing anybody.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I meant no harm to Robert Wendell with whom I discussed on this<br/>group<br/>&gt; to eventally conclude that his use of harmonics to improve pitch<br/>&gt; estimation is clever if (in my sense) a little over-optimistic.

Obviously (I say obviously now that I<br/>was proven wrong, it was not that obvious to me 3 days ago), as the<br/>string is much shorter and (I think) less tense than on an<br/>harpsichord.
