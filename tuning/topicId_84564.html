I really like what<br/>I&apos;m hearing here.  The conception is much larger than much<br/>of what we hear on these lists, which tend to be concise<br/>works (not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that).<br/>I completely agree about microtonalism as a technique rather<br/>than a genre.  I don&apos;t think anyone would seriously argue<br/>it&apos;s a genre, yet it seems to me people often speak as if it<br/>were.  I suppose it would be a bit like saying odd time<br/>signatures are a genre!</p><p>-Carl</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, I&apos;ve been really busy, but I&apos;ve gotten to hear<br/>&gt; all your works over the past week, so I&apos;ll miss a lot of<br/>&gt; e-mails.
