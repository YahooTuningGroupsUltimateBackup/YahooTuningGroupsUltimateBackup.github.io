Thanks...Hstick</p><p>I asked a related question on the midiguitar egroup.  What I have<br/>been able to gather is that guitar synths interpret your currently<br/>played note as the nearest note value (out of 12t-ET) plus pitch-bend<br/>(could be a positive or negative value from 0 to whatever).  So for<br/>the sound that is internal to the guitar synth (that is, _not_ an<br/>external MIDI module), what you play on a microtonal guitar will<br/>likely be heard as something with pitch-bend added.  For internal<br/>sounds, maybe you want to go with those that you still like even with<br/>pitch bend.  I would guess what would need to be done is for someone<br/>to implement tuning tables on the synth engine of the guitar synth<br/>itself... but only if you _don&apos;t_ want to use an external MIDI module.</p><p>External MIDI modules are a different matter.  They are listening for<br/>MIDI values such as note number, pitch bend, etc. rather than exact<br/>frequency (there was much initial confusion on this point on the<br/>midiguitar list).  At this end of your MIDI chain is where your<br/>tuning tables and such come into play - where incoming MIDI note<br/>numbers are mapped to your desired tuned pitches.</p><p>So at present, as a MIDI guitarist, if your controlling instrument is<br/>already hard-fretted with a microtonal scale (like your 19-tone<br/>guitar), Roland guitar synths will work, but you will hear your<br/>sounds as being &quot;pitch-bent&quot;.  If this is not an issue, then you are<br/>pretty much set - you don&apos;t need another sound module.  If it _is_ an<br/>issue, then you have to get another module - preferably one with<br/>tuning tables.</p><p>&gt; PS...and, on an electronic wind instrument...why couldn&apos;t someone do<br/>&gt; away with the keys, and instead make a ribbon of sorts, so a sax<br/>player<br/>&gt; can get any pitch? I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a good reason, but what is<br/>it...and,<br/>&gt; who can come up with a solution...?</p><p>The Kurweil ExpressionMate closely matches your description.  It is a<br/>ribbon controller that has a good selection of MIDI processing<br/>features.  The control box has a breath controller input.  It can be<br/>played as its own instrument with the pitch being selected on the<br/>ribbon and the BC handling volume, for example.</p><p>Kurzweil&apos;s page:</p><p><a href="http://www.kurzweilmusicsystems.com/html/expmate.html">http://www.kurzweilmusicsystems.com/html/expmate.html</a></p><p>Harmony Central reviews page:</p><p><a href="http://www.harmony-central.com/Synth/Data/Kurzweil/ExpressionMate-">http://www.harmony-central.com/Synth/Data/Kurzweil/ExpressionMate-</a><br/>01.html</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=16221 href="#16221">ðŸ”—</a>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>12/4/2000 12:19:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; The big question for me, is can the VG-88 digitally move the fret<br/>&gt; positions?
