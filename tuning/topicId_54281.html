This is by using the &quot;arrow&quot; linear temperament with that<br/>basis. Since 81/80 gives a straight flag and 64/63 gives a curved<br/>flag, you ought to be able to expeditiously notate the 13-limit (and<br/>the arrow temperaments 46, 224, 270 and 494) by suitable Sagittal<br/>symbols.</p><p>This is a finite problem--one out of every 22 13-limit intervals is<br/>notatable already just by octaves and fifths. Hence you need only a<br/>finite collection of symbols, which should be concoctable from<br/>straight and curved flags, to fully notate the 13-limit in a<br/>perspicuous manner, consistent with arrow and with the schisminas you<br/>already have introduced. The 81/80-64/63 representation of 3/2 is [4,<br/>23] and of 2 is [6, 40]; you can make a sort of Fokker block out of<br/>these, and ask for symbols for all 22 of the pairs [a, b] defined by<br/>the parallogram [0,0], [4,23], [6,40], [10,63], which we can<br/>translate to [-5, -31], [-1,-8], [1,9], [5, 32]. Then every 13-limit<br/>note becomes so many octaves, so many fifths, and one of these 22<br/>symbols (11 symbol pairs will do it), which are combinations of 81/80<br/>and 64/63.</p><p>Arrow is really an obvious choice if we want to consider the 13-<br/>limit, and let higher limits do their best to fit in. I ran a search<br/>for the very best 13-limit ets up to 10000, and obtained the<br/>following:</p><p>224 .780361<br/>270 .732188<br/>494 .688526<br/>1506 .761715<br/>6079 .663004</p><p>The second number is a 13-limit consistent logflat badness figure,<br/>which I bounded by 0.8. If you take any two of 224, 270 or 494<br/>together, you get arrow, and arrow happens to have 81/80 and 64/63 as<br/>a generator pair, which is perfect for Sagittal.</p></div><h3><a id=54301 href="#54301">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

So some of the symbols<br/>required for the 13-limit don&apos;t consist only of straight and convex<br/>flags (barbs and arcs) but instead use convex or wavy flags (scrolls<br/>or boathooks) via other (23-limit) schisminas.</p><p>The schisminas indicated as vanishing in table 1 in the XH paper do<br/>not necessarily vanish in the Olympian (extreme precision) JI<br/>notation which involves added 5-schisma accents (which is the only<br/>way we sort-of allow 3 flags per symbol).
