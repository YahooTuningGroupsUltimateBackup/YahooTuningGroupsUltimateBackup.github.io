It refers to music from<br/>&gt; northern India, as opposed to &quot;Carnatic Classical Music&quot;, which is from<br/>&gt; southern India.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While Hindu religious themes are common in the lyrics of Hindustani<br/>&gt; classical songs, there have been and continue to be many important<br/>&gt; non-Hindu (especially Muslim) composers and performers in the Hindustani<br/>&gt; Classical music tradition.</p><p>Thanks. Since you know a bit about South Asian classical<br/>music, care to comment on what makes North differ from<br/>South. A bit of topic for the tuning list, but I&apos;m curious.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
