Following up on Paul Poletti&apos;s discussions of what we could even<br/>call  Werckmeister VII tuning (unless I missed one along the way).  I have<br/>deduced its identity using a translation by  Ellen J. Archambault from her  PhD<br/>dissertation at Florida State University&apos;s School of Music in 1999.   Let me<br/>hear your thoughts.  Johnny<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>Another Werckmeister publication that contained important  tuning information<br/>came in the form of a 1698 essay entitled &ldquo;Short Lesson and  Addition, how<br/>one can tune and temper well a clavier.&rdquo;  It was added to &ldquo;Essential<br/>Annotations  and Rules Concerning the Proper Realization of the Basso Continuo or<br/>Thorough-Bass&rdquo; (Die nothwendigsten Ammerckungen und Regeln, wie der Bassus<br/>continuus oder General-Bass wohl k&ouml;nne tractiret warden).  Werckmeister directed this<br/>amendment  towards beginners in tacet recognition that organs will always<br/>need to be tuned  by trained professionals.  Werckmeister once again attempted to<br/>aid  the more na&iuml;ve readers in the actual tuning of a harpsichord.<br/>We  might consider calling this newly introduced tuning Werckmeister (1698),<br/>especially if we consider calling Werckmeister III tuning, &ldquo;Werckmeister<br/>(1681)&rdquo;  as it was the first well temperament introduced by the author, the other<br/>being  an older, Trost family tuning.  This  new 1698 tuning was not included<br/>on the published copper-plate monochord, and it  was distinguished from its<br/>predecessors for being easier to tune, and without  having to split commas.<br/>Essentially, it is simpler language for getting  started.<br/>In  following the Werckmeister&rsquo;s directions, it is possible to make some<br/>basic  assumptions as to what constitutes Werckmeister 1698.  Since Werckmeister<br/>rails against the  &ldquo;horrible&rdquo; 696 cent fifth of quarter comma meantone as &ldquo;<br/>lame,&rdquo; and admittedly,  four keys in Werckmeister III tuning have the same<br/>lameness, the direction given  this time is to detune a pure fifth &ldquo;a little bit<br/>lower,&rdquo; I will take to mean a  698 cent fifth.  This is the same  fifth as in<br/>sixth sixth comma meantone.  It is likely a nod by Werckmeister to the realities<br/>on the ground.  It provides a reasonable alternative to  the straight<br/>meantone.  The audience  for this new tuning is would not be expected to understand<br/>the intricacies to  tune any other way.  Besides, they  would need the odder<br/>intervals for improvisation that Buxtehude, Werckmeister,  and Bach needed. They<br/>might not rally around depicting gloomy  sentiments.<br/>Werckmeister&rsquo;s instruction for the fifth on the note  B-natural to be &ldquo;low<br/>very subtly&rdquo; is taken by me as a 700 cent fifth, the same  size as in<br/>conventional equal temperament.  Two cents, or a schisma, is the discrete tool that<br/>best depicts what is  otherwise a very general suggestion to get people going in<br/>tuning without too  much undue pain, providing some small insurance that they<br/>will achieve a  listenable success.  A further  direction, &ldquo;almost purely&rdquo; is<br/>taken as a 701 cent fifth, mathematically almost a  full single cent flat in<br/>comparing the G-sharp to its tonic D-sharp fifth.  For the fifths that are to<br/>be tuned &ldquo;a  little high,&rdquo; I chose 704 cents, a schisma higher pure fifth.<br/>Werckmeister treats the final F to C  fifth as a flexible buffer zone, leaving<br/>open the possibility for most any size  fifth.  My numbers gave a one cent<br/>sharp fourth at 499 cents, which works out quite well.  The eventual scale, in<br/>comparison with  the primary tuning of Musicalische Temperatur (1691), or<br/>Werckmeister III  tuning, demonstrates they sound much alike with no more than six<br/>cents  difference, and on only one note, A.  The other distances are much<br/>less.<br/>Werckmeister  Tuning(1698)<br/>C             C#           D             Eb           E              F<br/>      F#           G             G#           A             Bb           B<br/>0              88           196         293         392         499<br/>590         698         789         894         997         1092<br/>Werckmeister Tuning  (1681)<br/>C             C#           D             Eb           E              F<br/>      F#           G             G#           A             Bb           B</p><p>0              90           192         294         390         498<br/>588         696         792         888         996         1092<br/>However, comparing Werckmeister&rsquo;s 1698 tuning to the  cents figures of the<br/>increasingly practicable sixth comma meantone movement may  indicate that<br/>Werckmeister was a pioneer in that direction as well.  The sixth comma fifth, major<br/>second,  major third, and major sixth in the scale are core to Werckmeister<br/>1698.  This means they have the same notes in  common on C, D, E, F (because<br/>Werckmeister left this as a flexible buffer zone),  G, and A.  The biggest<br/>discrepancy  is the minor third of C, where Werckmeister chose to be 10 cents lower<br/>than  sixth comma meantone.  Werckmeister  (1698) relished the need to be<br/>moodier at times since he was an active  improviser readily called upon to express<br/>different sentiments.  C-sharp, F-sharp, and B-natural are each  within 2<br/>cents of the other, G-sharp is 5 cents apart, and B-flats are within 7  cents of<br/>the other.<br/>Werckmeister Tuning  (1698)<br/>C             C#           D             Eb           E              F<br/>      F#           G             G#           A             Bb           B<br/>0              88           196         293         392         499<br/>590         698         789         894         997         1092<br/>Sixth Comma Meantone (1681)<br/>C             C#           D             Eb           E              F<br/>      F#           G             G#           A             Bb           B</p><p>0              86           196         306         392         502<br/>588         698         784         894         1004       1090</p><p>**************It&apos;s Tax Time!

If anything other than what it is -Werckmeister&apos;s continuo<br/>temperament- I would call it &quot;Werckmeister&apos;s Ordinaire&quot;.</p><p>&gt;  I have<br/>&gt; deduced its identity using a translation by  Ellen J. Archambault<br/>from her  PhD<br/>&gt; dissertation at Florida State University&apos;s School of Music in 1999.<br/>  Let me<br/>&gt; hear your thoughts.  Johnny</p><p>My first thought is, if you want to &quot;deduce&quot; it&apos;s structure, why don&apos;t<br/>you just sit down and tune it according to Werckmeister&apos;s quite clear<br/>instructions, rather than relying on some modern mislead<br/>interpretation? Doing so will in fact demonstrate precisely how<br/>mislead said interpretation is.</p><p>Failing that, you can always download the spreadsheet I made which<br/>allows one to tweak things around without straying off the fairly<br/>narrow though by no means inflexible path W. described:</p><p><a href="http://polettipiano.com/Media/Werckmeister1698.xls">http://polettipiano.com/Media/Werckmeister1698.xls</a></p><p>(BTW, just noticed this link was broken, now it&apos;s fixed again)<br/>&gt;<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; This  new 1698 tuning was not included<br/>&gt; on the published copper-plate monochord, and it  was distinguished<br/>from its<br/>&gt; predecessors for being easier to tune, and without  having to split<br/>commas.</p><p>This is absolute Bullkrap! The continuo temperament is far more<br/>difficult to tune than WIII!! Any idiot can tune WIII with one ear<br/>tied behind his back; one starts with a series of pure fifths from C<br/>left around the circle to E, which pushes the comma into the zone C-E.<br/>Using these two notes as extremes, you then simply temper the four<br/>fifths more or less the same, and once you&apos;ve got &apos;em, you retune<br/>A-E-B as pure, pushing the last tempered fifth out to B-F#. Done.<br/>Finshed!! In Continuo there are many more fifths which must be<br/>tempered all by exactly the same amount (at the very least, C&lt;-&gt;G#),<br/>plus a couple fifths which must be tempered WIDER than pure. Depending<br/>on the mix you end up with, there are either NO pure fifths or one to<br/>two (MAX!) pure fifths. You only find out if it all works when you get<br/>to the very end of the whole process, and if it doesn&apos;t, you have to<br/>go back through a whole chain, adjusting and hoping yo get it right<br/>the second time. How is this easier?!</p><p>&gt; Essentially, it is simpler language for getting  started.</p><p>Bollocks!</p><p>&gt; In  following the Werckmeister&acirc;Â€Â™s directions, it is possible to<br/>make some<br/>&gt; basic  assumptions as to what constitutes Werckmeister 1698.  Since<br/>Werckmeister<br/>&gt; rails against the  &acirc;Â€Âœhorrible&acirc;Â€&#x9D; 696 cent fifth of quarter comma<br/>meantone as &acirc;Â€Âœ<br/>&gt; lame,&acirc;Â€&#x9D; and admittedly,  four keys in Werckmeister III tuning have<br/>the same<br/>&gt; lameness, the direction given  this time is to detune a pure fifth<br/>&acirc;Â€Âœa little bit<br/>&gt; lower,&acirc;Â€&#x9D; I will take to mean a  698 cent fifth.  This is the same<br/>fifth as in<br/>&gt; sixth sixth comma meantone.</p><p>1/6 Syn. comma is but one of the tempered fifths that will work. It<br/>could be anything from about 1/5 Syntonic to 1/7 Pythagorean and still<br/>work.</p><p>&gt; It is likely a nod by Werckmeister to the realities<br/>&gt; on the ground.</p><p>It is much more likely to be a nod by this modern author to the<br/>current fad for thinking that 1/6th comma meantone is some sort of<br/>default late 17th/early 18th century temperament.</p><p>That much said, I will say that the WHOLE APPROACH &quot;is likely a nod by<br/>Werckmeister to the realities on the ground&quot;, i.e. the widespread use<br/>of modified meantones.</p><p>&gt; It provides a reasonable alternative to  the straight<br/>&gt; meantone.</p><p>Indeed it does, as does any of the other modified meantones, including<br/>the French &quot;ordinaire&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The audience  for this new tuning is would not be expected to<br/>understand<br/>&gt; the intricacies to  tune any other way.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this sentence. None of Werkcmeister&apos;s 3<br/>rationalized circulating temperaments given in the 1691 copperplate<br/>are &quot;intricate&quot;, neither in structure nor application. You can both<br/>remember their structures and set them by ear precisely far more<br/>rapidly than you can the Continuo temperament. If anything, they are<br/>considerably simpler.</p><p>&gt;  Besides, they  would need the odder<br/>&gt; intervals for improvisation that Buxtehude, Werckmeister,  and Bach<br/>needed.</p><p>I suppose they is a typo for &quot;they woundN&apos;T need&quot;. Bullkrap again. It<br/>is quite easy to push the Contiunuo scheme to a point where it is<br/>actually BETTER than WWIII in providing distant keys; in it&apos;s mildest<br/>version, it only has ONE Pythagorean major third, whereas WIII has<br/>three. Ugh!</p><p>&gt; They<br/>&gt; might not rally around depicting gloomy  sentiments.</p><p>Cute but pointless.</p><p>&gt; The eventual scale, in<br/>&gt; comparison with  the primary tuning of Musicalische Temperatur<br/>(1691), or<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III  tuning, demonstrates they sound much alike with no<br/>more than six<br/>&gt; cents  difference, and on only one note, A.  The other distances are<br/>much<br/>&gt; less.</p><p>This is where this author shows her real ignorance. One does not<br/>compare historical temperaments by how much the individual notes of<br/>their &quot;scales&quot; differ, but rather by how much the major and minor<br/>TRIADS differ. WIII and any stripe of W Continuo do NOT sound &quot;much<br/>alike&quot;. One wonders if she even actually compared how they SOUND, or<br/>did she just play with some numbers?</p><p>&gt; However, comparing Werckmeister&acirc;Â€Â™s 1698 tuning to the  cents figures</p><p>Here we go again!</p><p>&gt; of the<br/>&gt; increasingly practicable sixth comma meantone movement</p><p>Here we go with THAT myth again!</p><p>&gt; may  indicate that<br/>&gt; Werckmeister was a pioneer in that direction as well.</p><p>Oh. First he was giving a nod to what was &quot;happening on the ground&quot;,<br/>now he is a &quot;pioneer&quot;. She sounds like Hillary Clinton trying to<br/>justify why the Michigan primary was &quot;fair&quot; and should be counted.</p><p>&gt; The sixth comma fifth, major<br/>&gt; second,  major third, and major sixth in the scale are core to<br/>Werckmeister<br/>&gt; 1698.</p><p>How do we know that? Pure invention on her part. Could just as well be<br/>1/5th or 1/7th.</p><p>What follows is naught but empty speculation about Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>desires and practices based on HER single interpretation.</p><p>I think it is shocking that in relatively recent times somebody can<br/>submit a doctoral thesis on Historical Temperaments and compare them<br/>in the outmoded and uniformation manner of Barbour&apos;s 1950&apos;s methodology.</p><p>Me &apos;umble opinee.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=75610 href="#75610">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2008 12:39:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(Is the discussion text Johnny gave his own, or Archambault&apos;s? I would<br/>guess the former.)</p><p>What is the &apos;identity&apos; of a tuning for which no mathematical<br/>specification was ever given? Seems to me we need a slightly wider<br/>vocabulary than Barbour&apos;s beloved cent tables, to avoid losing sight<br/>of practical / historical reality - by which no two people may have<br/>produced the same intervals, to say nothing of the musical effects,<br/>starting from the one set of instructions.</p><p>We need to distinguish two historical creatures. One is an instruction<br/>for tuning a keyboard, telling the tuner what needs to be done in what<br/>order, and what to listen for and how one can know if it is correct.<br/>I.e. a bearing plan.<br/>The second is a mathematical specification of a set of ratios, which<br/>may be approximated by frequency ratios of actual keyboard notes under<br/>certain conditions. I will call this a temperament scheme.</p><p>The two are quite distinct and different concepts and widely different<br/>in their musical applicability and the historical information they<br/>give us.</p><p>A bearing plan need not have any mathematical content at all in terms<br/>of commas, divisions thereof, integer ratios, etc. etc. The<br/>specification of the quality of intervals and chords may be simply<br/>that they are tolerable, or good, or as flat as the ear can support,<br/>or as pure as possible. These are all more or less subjective<br/>indications that can be directly evaluated by ear.</p><p>On the other hand, such a bearing plan *must* give indications that<br/>are adequate to produce a musically satisfactory result. That is, at<br/>the end of the process the tuner must have been able to adjust all the<br/>musically useful intervals and chords so that they sound good enough.<br/>The musical judgement and experience of the tuner, particularly the<br/>ability to compare intervals having different amounts of temperament,<br/>may be directly called upon.</p><p>Of course, this doesn&apos;t mean that the result could just be anything.<br/>The structure of the bearing plan and the remarks that go along with<br/>it almost always allow us to deduce what kind of result was expected.</p><p>By contrast, a mathematical temperament scheme may or may not be<br/>applicable directly by ear to a keyboard instrument. It depends<br/>strongly on the prior expertise that the tuner brings to the task of<br/>translating mathematical entities into real sounding notes.<br/>Whether or not the result of such a process sounds good depends first,<br/>on whether the author of the scheme knew what he was doing; second, on<br/>whether the tuner is technically competent to produce a mathematically<br/>good approximation; third, on whether the inevitable *deviations* of<br/>the actual notes from the mathematical scheme are handled attentively<br/>and with musical judgement - or just at random.</p><p>For instance it is quite difficult to tune an *exact* pure fifth by<br/>ear on some instruments - eg pipe organ. A small deviation from the<br/>&apos;correct&apos; mathematical ratio can exist, even if the interval sounds<br/>pure. Now &apos;Werckmeister III&apos; uses no fewer than 8 pure fifths. What<br/>then happens if the tuner&apos;s technique is such that it leaves them a<br/>tiny bit wide? Say +1 cent error on just half of them... that leaves<br/>the 4 flat fifths to take up 28 cents of temperament in total - each<br/>of which is then virtually 1/3 syntonic comma flat! Almost nothing<br/>will sound good with such a tuning, but Werckmeister&apos;s text gives no<br/>inkling of how this could happen, or what to do about it.<br/>On the other hand if one sets the bearings slightly differently and<br/>allows for the &apos;pure&apos; fifths to err on the narrow side, while the<br/>&apos;flat&apos; ones are more like 1/4 syntonic, the result will be much more<br/>tolerable.</p><p>This illustrates the major weakness of the mathematically specified<br/>temperament schemes. They don&apos;t tell the tuner what to do if things go<br/>a bit awry, which is inevitable in practice; how to prevent, diagnose<br/>and correct, or allow for, or even take advantage of, imprecision in<br/>setting the temperament. In short, they say almost nothing about the<br/>art and craft of tuning.</p><p>If good tuners did (try to) use such schemes, they still had to apply<br/>a set of practical procedures to make the result sound good - which<br/>were not mentioned in the sources where the schemes are.</p><p>The subjective bearing plan, by contrast, honestly and directly allows<br/>for tuners to hear and choose for themselves what interval qualities<br/>are musically more or less acceptable. It does not refer to an ideal<br/>of setting up mathematical entities on an instrument; rather, it<br/>privileges the musical experience and judgment of the practitioner.</p><p>The essential step in such plans is balancing one tempered interval<br/>against another.<br/>If it&apos;s meantone, this can mean balancing the flatness of F-C-G<br/>against the sharpness of A-D-G. Or the sharpness of C-E against the<br/>flatness of C-G-D-A-E. (And not necessarily an equal balance!)<br/>If it&apos;s modified meantone or ordinaire, it can mean balancing E-G#<br/>against Eb-Ab, or against F-Ab, or B-D# against Eb-G, or Eb-Bb against<br/>Bb-F.<br/>If it&apos;s a circulating &apos;good&apos; temperament, it can mean starting off by<br/>balancing F-A against A-C# and C#-F... etc. etc.</p><p>None of this requires any calculations of fractions of commas or<br/>worrying about whether the circle is going to be closed at the end.<br/>But it does require that the tuner checks the right thirds, fifths,<br/>major and minor triads at the appropriate moments throughout the<br/>process. This is the practical way to prevent mistakes and surprises:<br/>check early and check often. For example in the Werckmeister<br/>instructions one has to check C-E before proceeding further. Once one<br/>gets to G# one can try constructing a chord of F minor to see how if<br/>it is tolerable. One step further it is implied to check that Eb has<br/>been sharpened such that both B-D# and Eb-G are tolerable. Then the Bb<br/>must be sharpened so that Bb-D is OK. By this point it is basically<br/>impossible for the circle not to be closable. Simply because one has<br/>already listened to all the musically used thirds and fifths in doing<br/>the temperament, the result will *by construction* always sound good<br/>enough in musical application.</p><p>In short: the musical &apos;identity&apos; of a historical tuning consists not<br/>of a table of comma fractions or cent values regardless of the<br/>competence or taste of their execution.<br/>The tuning&apos;s identity is given by the questions: What intervals or<br/>chords must the tuner listen to? In which order? What acoustic or<br/>musical qualities or conditions must they be adjusted to fulfil?</p><p>Any supposed historical tuning that consists only of a row of<br/>comma-fractions to be applied to fifths and fourths, or of monochord<br/>values, without any indication of a bearing plan or of checks, cannot<br/>contain any useful information about how keyboards were actually<br/>tuned. Because no good tuning can be set just by tempering fifths and<br/>fourths found the circle, or by monochord.<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div>
