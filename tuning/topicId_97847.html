But here is an example, right at the historical heart of the regular temperament paradigm, that needs to corrected or further explained, or something.</p><p>Well, first off, you&apos;re looking at the 7-limit version of miracle,<br/>which is silly, because the 11-limit one is the real winner here. But<br/>okay, let&apos;s work with the 7-limit version, because it might make it<br/>easier to explain.</p><p>Think back to Fokker. Let&apos;s take a break from miracle and say you&apos;re<br/>in 7-limit JI: there are four dimensions that represent every note in<br/>the system: 2, 3, 5, and 7. If you find some comma and temper it, you<br/>will distort the axes of the system so that there are only 3<br/>remaining, each of which represents some combination of a tempered 2,<br/>3, 5, and 7. You now have a rank 3, or a &quot;planar&quot; temperament. If you<br/>temper out one more, you will only have two axes remaining, and now<br/>you&apos;re at rank 2, which leads to wonderful things like MOS scales.<br/>Temper out one more and you end up at rank 1, which is an equal<br/>temperament.</p><p>An important theorem that results from this is, if you&apos;re in a 5-limit<br/>system and you temper out two commas, you will end up at a single<br/>equal temperament. Or, in other words, the only equal temperament that<br/>eliminates 81/80 and 128/125 is 12-equal. If you&apos;re starting at the<br/>7-limit, and you temper out three commas, you still just end up at a<br/>single equal temperament. If you&apos;re in the 7-limit and you temper out<br/>250/243, 64/63, and 50/49, you will end up with 22-equal and only<br/>22-equal.</p><p>So in the case of 7-limit miracle temperament, there are two commas<br/>vanishing - 1029/1024, 225/224 -  and you&apos;re at rank 2. But, when you<br/>look at different equal temperaments that &quot;support&quot; miracle<br/>temperament, there will necessarily be another comma that vanishes on<br/>top of those, which was the comma that brought you down to rank 1. In<br/>the case of 31-equal, 81/80 vanishes. With 41-equal, which also<br/>supports miracle, the schisma vanishes. With 72-equal, it&apos;s the<br/>pythagorean comma.</p><p>The &quot;additional&quot; comma actually ends up turning into an infinite<br/>series of commas, for example - in 31-equal, it&apos;s not only 81/80 that<br/>vanishes, but also 126/125 as well, since 126/125 and 81/80 are<br/>separated by 225/224, which also vanishes within the miracle system.</p><p>The real point is that these temperaments define scales, and in the<br/>case of miracle some important scales defined are the 10, 21, 31 note<br/>MOS&apos;s - and their MODMOS&apos;s, which have yet to be explored - and these<br/>scales exist whether or not 81/80 vanishes and aren&apos;t much affected<br/>either way if it does. I think the 81/80 pun pops up only one time in<br/>the 31-tet version of blackjack, because there ends up being a string<br/>of four fifths, which in 31-tet is equated to 10/3.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97851 href="#97851">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2011 7:28:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Apr 12, 2011 at 10:16 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The real point is that these temperaments define scales, and in the<br/>&gt; case of miracle some important scales defined are the 10, 21, 31 note<br/>&gt; MOS&apos;s - and their MODMOS&apos;s, which have yet to be explored - and these<br/>&gt; scales exist whether or not 81/80 vanishes and aren&apos;t much affected<br/>&gt; either way if it does.

Right now, they<br/>don&apos;t, because we aren&apos;t sure what features really define a tonal<br/>structure yet, so it&apos;s a bit hit or miss. But hopefully, once we<br/>figure it out, we&apos;ll be able to have a miracle-oriented tonality, a<br/>meantone-oriented tonality which we already know, a porcupine-oriented<br/>tonality, etc. And once you&apos;re &quot;thinking&quot; in a miracle tonal system,<br/>whether or not the chosen miracle tuning also makes 81/80 vanish will<br/>be sort of a side thing that isn&apos;t as important, just like how the<br/>12-tet tuning for meantone makes 128/125 vanish isn&apos;t as important if<br/>you&apos;re thinking diatonically (but does pop up occasionally).</p><p>But we&apos;re not there yet, because the regular mapping paradigm isn&apos;t<br/>complete yet. I think that a more thorough search of the MODMOS&apos;s of<br/>each temperament will help us get there. I also think that Petr&apos;s<br/>recent work with comma pumps, and Gene&apos;s recent development of the<br/>&quot;minimal&quot; comma pump for each temperament, will also help us get<br/>there. I tend to think that tonality is more a feature of harmony<br/>itself than of scales, but that certain scales can compactly<br/>encapsulate the things that make tonality work, and that the diatonic<br/>scale does this nicely. Anyway, if you have more insight into this,<br/>I&apos;m all ears.</p><p>One last point is that I feel that your mentioning of 81/80 vanishing<br/>in the 31-tet version of miracle is one of the drawbacks of thinking<br/>in purely rank 2 systems when you&apos;re in a rank 1 tuning. For example,<br/>128/125 and 648/625 vanish in the 12-tet version of meantone, and this<br/>provides additional musical structure outside of the meantone<br/>structure itself. For example, there are very much certain cases where<br/>the 128/125 unison vector is utilized in modern meantone-oriented<br/>music, like the 12-tet altered scale - C Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb C - where<br/>Fb and E end up being the same thing in 12-tet. So you have,<br/>effectively C-E-Bb in the 12-tet altered scale, and this scale is used<br/>over dominant 7 chords all the time in jazz. Consequently, if you were<br/>to try and use this scale in 19-tet, the C-Fb would now be something<br/>on the order of 450 cents, and the whole concept wouldn&apos;t work as<br/>well.</p><p>Another example is if you start with lydian - C D E F# G A B C - and<br/>you sharp the 2: C D# E F# G A B C. Now you have lydian #2, which is a<br/>mode of harmonic minor and a beautiful scale. Now let&apos;s say, instead,<br/>that you flat the 7: C D E F# G A Bb C - you get lydian dominant,<br/>which is a mode of melodic minor, and another beautiful scale.<br/>Finally, let&apos;s say you want to both sharp the 2 AND flat the 7: you<br/>get C D# E F# G A Bb C. In 12-tet, this is a 7-note subset of<br/>diminished[8]: C Db D# E F# G A Bb C - so it lets you mix<br/>diminished[8] in with diatonic harmony, and suddenly you have this<br/>mixing of temperaments and tonal structures together. This is yet<br/>another technique that is used all the time in jazz (and, at one<br/>point, was used in popular music too).</p><p>Analogously to how rank 2 meantone techniques &quot;don&apos;t quite work&quot; in<br/>rank 3 5-limit JI, the above rank 1 12-meantone technique &quot;doesn&apos;t<br/>quite work&quot; in rank 2 meantone. Nor does it work in 19-meantone or<br/>31-meantone, where 128/125 and 648/625 don&apos;t vanish. And this isn&apos;t<br/>something you&apos;d realize if you&apos;re thinking only in rank-2 systems like<br/>meantone, but it&apos;s been a crucial feature of a huge portion of the<br/>music written in the last 100 years. Which is why I prefer to work in<br/>rank-2 &quot;modalities&quot; but in rank-1 tunings, because it leads to an<br/>awesome jumping around of temperaments and tonal structures like that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97855 href="#97855">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2011 8:11:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>LOL.

This needs a footnote at least.</p><p>Take a square. Now let&apos;s say that you round the edges of the square -<br/>you now have an altered version of the original object. It&apos;s &quot;a<br/>square,&quot; but &quot;with rounded edges.&quot; If you only round them 0.01%, you&apos;d<br/>never know it wasn&apos;t a square! But, if you round them too much, you<br/>might instead feel like you now have a &quot;circle&quot; that has been &quot;cut<br/>off&quot; at the sides. On the other hand, if you round the edges 99.9%,<br/>you&apos;d never know it wasn&apos;t a circle. Or, maybe you would insist that<br/>neither the 0.001% rounded square, nor the 99.99% rounded pretty much<br/>circle, are really a square or a circle at all. You&apos;d insist that both<br/>of these are their own, unique objects, and that you can learn to<br/>distinguish them from a square and a circle.</p><p>All of these are analogous to different &quot;mappings&quot; that you can apply<br/>to a &quot;tempered&quot; square. And you are free to apply whatever mapping you<br/>want. The point of &quot;regular mapping&quot; isn&apos;t to force judgments about<br/>when a square stops being a square or when it starts being a circle -<br/>it&apos;s just a mathematical structure to formalize whatever judgments you<br/>choose to make. It isn&apos;t psychoacoustics, it isn&apos;t harmonic entropy,<br/>it&apos;s pure mathematics. It enables you to make your own judgments, and<br/>then use secret esoteric voodoo witchcraft/mathematical tools to see<br/>what the structure is that those judgments imply. It allows you to see<br/>whatever the 17th-order logical implications of whatever judgments you<br/>made are, because unless you&apos;re a genius you aren&apos;t going to<br/>immediately see them.</p><p>You can map anything to anything you want. You can map the 0.01%<br/>rounded square to a square, which is probably a logical choice. Or,<br/>you could say that the 0.01% rounded square is just a really<br/>straightened out circle... if you wanted. Likewise, if you really<br/>want, you can map 14 cents to 9/7, and the mathematics is there to<br/>help you do it. You can also define the 5-limit rank 2 temperament<br/>that eliminates 5/3 as a &quot;comma,&quot; if you want, and there will be a<br/>logically consistent structure that results - and here it is:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=1_2&error=843.409&limit=5&invariant=1_1_1_0_0">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=1_2&error=843.409&limit=5&invariant=1_1_1_0_0</a></p><p>I see that nobody has decided to name this temperament... I wonder<br/>why. Anyway, whether that structure is useful enough to make music is<br/>up to you, which is when you have to leave the realm of pure<br/>mathematics and have to start to making musical decisions, which could<br/>be informed by models like harmonic entropy, or informed instead by an<br/>internal concept that has more to do with JI, and also with your own<br/>varied musical experiences, and so on.</p><p>So, back to your example. In 31, the nearest interval to 3/2 is the<br/>697 interval, so most people choose to &quot;map&quot; the 697 cent interval to<br/>3/2. That is, we say it&apos;s a 3/2 with some rounded edges. But, maybe<br/>you see things differently. Maybe you feel that in between a square<br/>and a circle lies an object that is its own fundamental entity - and<br/>that the 697 cent interval is its own animal, not 3/2 at all, and that<br/>it is more accurately described as the fourth root of five. You could<br/>do that if you wanted, which would put you in a 2.5^(1/4)-limit<br/>system. Or maybe you&apos;d like to frame things where we&apos;re all in a<br/>2.3.5^(1/4) system, but everyone else likes to &quot;temper&quot; out the<br/>&quot;comma&quot; between 5^(1/4) and 3/2, and you don&apos;t like to. That is also<br/>fine. People might think your ideas are a bit eccentric, and you might<br/>get into some arguments with people, but the math allows you to do<br/>whatever you want.</p><p>The list&apos;s psychoacoustic ideas are admittely not as developed as its<br/>mathematical ideas, and that&apos;s why I think you shouldn&apos;t let your<br/>criticism of harmonic entropy hinder you from learning about regular<br/>mapping. Gene isn&apos;t the biggest fan of harmonic entropy either.<br/>There&apos;s just an infinite landscape of new musical territory out there,<br/>and the math allows us to narrow things down and find scales and<br/>temperaments that we think will be useful, or have the features we<br/>want for the piece we&apos;re writing. The debate over which psychoacoustic<br/>parameters should inform &quot;usefulness&quot; is a side issue which I think<br/>comes up a bit too often on this list - do what you want, use the<br/>math, write music. That&apos;s all.</p><p>Phew.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97859 href="#97859">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2011 9:46:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Apr 12, 2011 at 11:36 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Tue, Apr 12, 2011 at 10:16 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The real point is that these temperaments define scales, and in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; case of miracle some important scales defined are the 10, 21, 31 note<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; MOS&apos;s - and their MODMOS&apos;s, which have yet to be explored - and these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scales exist whether or not 81/80 vanishes and aren&apos;t much affected<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; either way if it does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realize that proper &quot;strict miracle&quot; thinking doesn&apos;t assume anything about 81/80, why do you think I stopped at 3*(8/7) when introducing the temperament and didn&apos;t bring in any relation of 3/2 and 5/4?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But think about this: if we&apos;re looking at 3*(8/7) equally &quot;3/2&quot; as a vital and defining element, then we&apos;re also looking at modalities of 26-edo which are related to &quot;miracle&quot; in this way.</p><p>The temperament that divides 3/2 into three 8/7&apos;s with no further<br/>subdivision is called &quot;gamelismic temperament&quot; - miracle requires it<br/>to be divided into 6 parts. But yes - you&apos;re right: 26 technically<br/>supports gamelismic temperament, and as you are aware, it&apos;s a pretty<br/>crappy tuning for it. So does 16, and that&apos;s even worse. 5-equal and<br/>21-equal are some other crappy tunings.</p><p>If you&apos;re really sadistic, the closest approximation to 3/2 in<br/>11-equal is also split into 3 parts, and each part is the closest<br/>approximation to 8/7, so technically 11-equal is also a gamelismic<br/>temperament, but that&apos;s a bit silly.</p><p>Since it is a bit silly, it&apos;s at this point that you might want to<br/>consider just not mapping 3/2 to anything in 11-equal at all, and<br/>change the prime-limit that you&apos;re working within to have a hole in it<br/>at 3 - a subgroup temperament. 11-equal has no useful 3 or 5 to speak<br/>of, but it has a somewhat passable 9/8, albeit not ideal, and so you<br/>can map it as a 2.7.9.11-limit system. It actually works really well<br/>as a <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> subgroup system - it&apos;s about as accurate with 4:7:9:11<br/>as 12-equal is with 4:5:6.</p><p>So if you apply that mapping to 11-equal instead, then it&apos;s not a<br/>gamelismic temperament anymore. And if you think that the fifth of<br/>26-equal is too flat to count as a 3/2, then with your mapping 26<br/>isn&apos;t a gamelismic temperament either. On the other hand, I love<br/>26-equal even with its flat fifths, so I don&apos;t mind using it like<br/>that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Another point is that, someday, I hope these temperaments won&apos;t just<br/>&gt; &gt; define scales, but define entire tonal structures.

But, the sixth root of 3/2 and the sixth root of fourth-root-of-5 are deeply different matters altogether. The same temperament tempering out 81/80 here and not tempering it out there is simply not a concept that is going to fly well- not when the comma is as important as 81/80. Not when 3 and 5 are vital aspects of the temperament.</p><p>The basic problem here is that if you add 81/80 to 225/224 and 1029/1024, you don&apos;t get the same temperament, you get a different temperament, namely 7-limit 31et. This is an instance of a general phenomenon, which is that a temperament of lower rank can support a temperament of higher rank. If the tuning doesn&apos;t change much, the two may be closely identified. This isn&apos;t the case here; in 72, a better tuning for miracle than 32, the 81/80 comma remains comma-sized. Tempering it out isn&apos;t something a optimized tuning of miracle would suggest. On the other hand for the rank three prodigy temperament, tempering out 225/224 and 441/440, an optimized tuning will shrink 1029/1024 (and 385/384, 243/242 etc.) down to a tiny interval of a fraction of a cent, so we may as well add it, getting miracle. Prodigy is then seen as a sort of 2D layout for miracle, in place of secors.</p><p>Another way of looking at it is in terms of complexity. In miracle, the complexity of 81/80 is 31, so it is a complex interval we won&apos;t run into in smaller scales like Blackjack. In meantone, 1029/1024 has complexity 31, and again you aren&apos;t likely to trip across it.</p></div><h3><a id=97863 href="#97863">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2011 9:59:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; The real point is that these temperaments define scales, and in the<br/>&gt; &gt; case of miracle some important scales defined are the 10, 21, 31 note<br/>&gt; &gt; MOS&apos;s - and their MODMOS&apos;s, which have yet to be explored</p><p>They&apos;ve been dabbled in.</p><p>&gt; Another point is that, someday, I hope these temperaments won&apos;t just<br/>&gt; define scales, but define entire tonal structures.

However, I think that the diatonic scale serves as a neat<br/>way to &quot;encapsulate&quot; the useful features of tonality. In the early<br/>20th century, as folks started to experiment more and more with<br/>extended harmonies, switching to diminished[8] for dominant 7 chords<br/>sometimes, or making use of 128/125 as a unison vector other times, we<br/>got further away from needing the simple diatonic &quot;tonal scale&quot;<br/>abstraction and got closer to ascalar tonality. That is, clinging to<br/>the diatonic scale as the source of tonal structure became less and<br/>less important, because folks started to figure out how to still<br/>remain tonal outside of it.</p><p>But it was useful, at first, before people realized that those<br/>techniques were there, to treat the diatonic scale as a dumbed down<br/>source of tonal enlightenment to enable someone to write tonal chord<br/>progressions really easily. This is still useful for basic musicians<br/>who don&apos;t know anything about extended harmony, but know about I, IV,<br/>and V.</p><p>So I wish that, for every temperament, like say miracle, in addition<br/>to listing the MOS&apos;s, we also listed the similarly dumbed down &quot;tonal&quot;<br/>MODMOS&apos;s that had the same features that make tonality work.

I&apos;ve noticed this pattern of detuned<br/>higher-limit sonorities resolving to lower-limit ones, but I don&apos;t<br/>know if it&apos;s significant. The detuning makes sense, because you want<br/>to create dissonance on a chord that wants to resolve, but I&apos;m not<br/>sure if the higher limit -&gt; lower limit thing is significant in some<br/>sense or just a coincidence. It might be that the detuned 4:5:6:7:9:11<br/>is like ATTENTION! for a certain fundamental, and then it moves to a<br/>weaker fundamental a 3/2 away, and finally resolves to the I chord<br/>another 3/2 away... ah.

Obviously I very well understand the distinguishing principles between miracle and meantone-7, for example, having recently posted a calculated demonstration of non-meantone use of 19-edo on MMM. The point I&apos;m trying to emphasize the importance of is that the xenwiki absolutely needs, in the introduction to regular temperament, a statement to effect &quot;the definition and identity of temperaments in the regular temperament paradigm require what amount to specific compositional rules&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Compositional rules&quot; sounds bad. I propose &quot;distinguishing modalities&quot;. This needs to be explained in the introduction, and distinguishing modalities included as part of the definition of a temperament.</p><p>I propose this:</p><p>&quot;The definition and identity of a temperament includes the identification and application of modalities which distingish the temperament from other temperaments which may share the same raw tuning material. That is, a temperament is more than the material<br/>with which it is realized, it is also the way these materials are used in musical practice.&quot;</p><p>This is accurate and necessary- miracle tuned to 31-edo and meantone-7 cannot be distinguished in conception or practice without this understanding. Gene&apos;s example of the blackjack scale making the distinction between miracle and meantone-7, even if both are tuned to 31-edo, is an example of a structure which has distinguishing modality &quot;built in&quot;.</p></div>
