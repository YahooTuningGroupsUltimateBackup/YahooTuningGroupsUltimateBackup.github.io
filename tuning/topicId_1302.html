Do you mean language<br/>&gt; imposes constraints on perceptual cognition,<br/>&gt; or on other types of cognition?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I can illustrate best by an example.  Latin is<br/>an inflectional language: it uses various different<br/>suffixes attached to the end of a stem to form<br/>a complete word.  Each part, the stem and the<br/>suffix, has a particular meaning: the stem is<br/>the &quot;basic&quot; meaning of the word, and the suffix<br/>provides such information as person, tense,<br/>and mood, etc.</p><p>Chinese, on the other hand,  is called an<br/>&quot;analytic&quot; language, meaning that each word<br/>is unvarying and can function as any part<br/>of speech.  Thus, in Chinese there is no<br/>such thing as verb, noun, adjective, etc.  The<br/>functions of the words, and thus the meaning<br/>of the sentence, is derived mainly from<br/>the *positions* of the words in relation<br/>to each other. (Interestingly, English was<br/>originally inflectional and thru-out its history<br/>has tended increasingly towards analytic.)</p><p>The point is that although both languages<br/>can convey the same basic idea of something,<br/>neither can translate the other *exactly*<br/>because they work in distinctly different ways.<br/>(A Chinese phrase which translates roughly<br/>literally as &quot;one road tranquil quiet&quot; is the<br/>equivalent of French &quot;bon voyage&quot;, which<br/>is a shortening of the French for &quot;have a<br/>good trip&quot;.)</p><p>No language can every convey every shade<br/>of meaning that exists in another language.<br/>Thus the difficulty of having computers make<br/>translations - the rules are just too complex<br/>for us to grasp at present, and may always<br/>remain so.</p><p>To that extent, the Latin-speaking person can<br/>never imagine quite the same things the<br/>Chinese-speaking person can, and vice<br/>versa, unless he learns the other language.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that it is not possible to create<br/>a previously inexistent concept out of elements<br/>or ideas that can already be expressed.<br/>Every language continues to grow in this way.<br/>But tellingly, new words are often borrowed<br/>whole from other languages along with the<br/>concepts they express, rather than created<br/>anew out of familiar linguistic components.</p><p>And not included in this argument is the idea<br/>that there are things imaginable which have<br/>no way to be expressed in any language<br/>the imaginer knows.  This is why a lot of<br/>musicians play music, and why artists paint<br/>pictures.</p><p>- Monzo</p><p> |\=/|.-&quot;&quot;&quot;-.
