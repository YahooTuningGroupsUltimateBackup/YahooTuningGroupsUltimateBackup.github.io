I remember being flabbergasted that it hadn&apos;t<br/>happened yet! When I&apos;d think of Joe I&apos;d often think of Bird--of his<br/>unfulfilled longing to study with Varese to add a whole other<br/>dimension to his art. In many ways, Joe Maneri was already there: a<br/>prototypical jazzman-modern composer, and a wildly talented one at<br/>that... inexplicably his time would have to wait almost another four<br/>decades.</p><p>But his time came. And when it finally did, the recordings and<br/>accolades followed in a steady stream that continues to this day. I<br/>doubt it couldn&apos;t have happened to a more deserving person.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>A Free Man: Joe Maneri&apos;s music rides the currents of his heart</p><p>by Ed Hazell</p><p>On paper, Joe Maneri seems intimidating. He&apos;s one of those imposing<br/>multi-hyphenated polymaths--composer<br/>instrumentalist-educator-author--who can make you feel inadequate. In<br/>person, the outgoing New England Conservatory professor is more like a<br/>jovial, but weird, Burl Ives than a forbidding academic. Perhaps it&apos;s<br/>because the 64-year-old&apos;s circuitous road to academia has taken him<br/>from the streets of Brooklyn to the lecture halls of Austria and from<br/>the Quartones dance band in the Catskills to microtones at NEC.</p><p>His debut CD as an improviser, Kavalinka (Cochlea/Northeastern), is an<br/>all too-rare event in a remarkable and largely overlooked career. It&apos;s<br/>difficult music, alternately touched with an Old World sadness and an<br/>otherworldly joy. Entirely improvised by Maneri on clarinet and tenor,<br/>his son Matt on violin, and percussionist Masashi Harada, it sounds<br/>chaotic at first but is actually linked in subtle elliptical ways.<br/>Their spontaneous ordering of possibilities is the source of the<br/>music&apos;s power and excitement. Sometimes the players compliment one<br/>another, one finishing a thought another has started. Sometimes they<br/>contrast: undulating clarinet lines playing off against long, slow<br/>violin tones and spacious percussion touches.</p><p>The music is melodic, but not in any conventional sense. The melodies<br/>are sometimes built out of the smallest of intervals, tiny contours<br/>that make you listen for fine gradations of pitch. But then the music<br/>will exhaust itself, jumping in huge, wide leaps. The elder Maneri&apos;s<br/>clarinet is especially moving, tinged with the Italian and Greek<br/>sonorities he learned playing in dance bands. The younger Maneri is<br/>someone to watch, full of quiet surprises and understated virtuosity.<br/>And Harada&apos;s percussion is loaded with unexpected silences and sudden<br/>onrushes of noise.</p><p>Maneri grew up in ethnically diverse Brooklyn, where he learned<br/>clarinet with a shoemaker who played drums in a neighborhood Italian<br/>dance band. By his late teens, he was working with the Quartones,<br/>touring New England and the Catskills.</p><p>But he was never one to play anything straight for long. &quot;I was always<br/>jumping hurdles into a different place. I was always sort of naturally<br/>avant-garde. I was starting to play wrong notes. My ear is good, but<br/>not for normal people,&quot; he says.</p><p>Maneri&apos;s lifelong rebelliousness led him to some Greenwich Village<br/>hipsters in 1947. &quot;One night I heard Schoenberg on the phonograph and<br/>I thought, &apos;Holy cow, he does all the wrong notes at once.&apos; So we<br/>started a 12-tone jazz group.&quot;</p><p>In 1951, through his beatnik friends, he met Joseph Schmidt, a former<br/>student of Schoenberg&apos;s, and studied with him for more than ten years.<br/>During this time, he worked in several ethnic bands, becoming a<br/>virtuoso player in Greek, Turkish, Arabic, and Armenian music.</p><p>Word of his talent began to spread. A 1957 trio for piano, bass, and<br/>drums that included some improvised sections caught the attention of<br/>future BSO conductor Eric Leinsdorf, who commissioned him to write a<br/>piano concerto but never performed it. Around the same time, his<br/>reputation as an improviser who could also read led Gunther Schuller<br/>to ask him to perform a composition by David Dreck dedicated to<br/>Ornette Coleman.</p><p>By the early &apos;60s, Maneri was playing jazz again. In 1962, he made a<br/>pioneering, but unreleased, record for Atlantic combining Greek<br/>melodies, jazz, and 12-tone music. In the quintet was drummer Peter<br/>Dolger, with whom Maneri performed at one of the celebrated St.<br/>Peter&apos;s Peace Church concerts in New York in 1963. The concert was a<br/>personal milestone for Maneri. &quot;At one point I saw the Holocaust; I<br/>started feeling so bad I started crying while I was playing. What I<br/>played changed my life, it&apos;s the style I&apos;ve incorporated up until<br/>today.&quot;</p><p>After that, Maneri dropped out. He lived out of his car, then became a<br/>hospital orderly. Eventually, he returned to teaching in 1970, when<br/>Robert DiDomenica asked him to teach theory and composition at the New<br/>England Conservatory.</p><p>At NEC, his composing took a new turn when, in 1972, he began using<br/>microtones, the intervals between the sharps and flats in a<br/>conventional Western scale. Since then, he has founded the Boston<br/>Microtonal Society, written a book, and invented a microtonal<br/>keyboard. Currently he teaches the only course in microtonal<br/>composition in the US.</p><p>One of the first of his microtonal pieces, a quartet for clarinet,<br/>trombone, tuba, and piano, is entitled Ephphatha, meaning &quot;open up.&quot;<br/>The title holds special significance for Maneri. &quot;I often tell<br/>students, stay open to the spirit of your soul, stay open to the<br/>spirit of your heart, and stay open to the spirit of your mind, and if<br/>there&apos;s nothing in your mind, go put something in it.&quot; Advice Maneri<br/>can give, since he&apos;s followed it his whole life.</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2002 5:36:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,</p><p>Thanks for the Maneri article.
