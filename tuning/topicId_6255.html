That includes Joe&apos;s<br/>correction to the effect that the non-standard pair of pianos in the<br/>Wyschnegradsky work are a quarter-tone _higher. By the time the tape came<br/>through the radio, neither pair was at standard pitch, so I assumed the<br/>opposite config, just to assume sum&apos;m. Besides that, at a pause in the third<br/>movement they changed tapes or the machine got happy and shifted up a<br/>fraction in pitch. Now all I have to do is pitch-restore the whole thing<br/>plus removing all the background noise.<br/>Concerning that piece, Mr. Wolfe wondered what I meant when I said that I<br/>thought Wysch&apos;s application of quarter-tones sounded more &quot;integral&quot; than<br/>did Haba&apos;s. Your point&apos;s well taken. I haven&apos;t looked closely enough to<br/>compare their uses of &quot;diminution.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s a question of degree; I&apos;ve<br/>not thought about it much below the top of my hat that I never wear. It&apos;s<br/>just that, to my perception, the style of &quot;Zarathoustra&quot; provides me with a<br/>much stronger sense of the different musical moods that quarter-tone writing<br/>can produce than does Haba. Mind you, I do hear a kind of beauty in the Haba<br/>that bespeaks sensitivity to the aural effect of the music and not simply a<br/>theoretical exercise.<br/>Great list! I haven&apos;t been so caught up in this stuff since grad school 35<br/>years ago.</p></div>
