Well...I have the musical source. :-P&nbsp; Second note in the high melody is a 13/9, which drones over the seventh note in the lower melody, which is the root 1/1 (or &quot;9/9&quot;).</p><p>&nbsp; Note though, there is only one tempered 13/9 interval in the entire scale...all the rest of the 5ths are near-perfect (and in all my scales, including Dimension, a large majority of the fifths are perfect and I use my &quot;alternative 22/15 fifths&quot; sparingly in that scale)..</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also note: 19TET does a pretty good approximation of the scale I used in this little example...in fact it pretty much pans out to be a version of &quot;19TET diatonic&quot;...the interesting part being the 13/9-ish and a tad under 7/5 intervals formed are certainly not 12TET-ish sounding.<br/>&nbsp; In general, you get a BP fourth and undecimal diminished 6th in place of the two tri-tones in 12TET...that&apos;s the &quot;only&quot; major difference.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted though, minus those two intervals...virtually everything in the scale interval-wise is either &quot;plain old&quot; 5-limit-esque or 12TET-like (IE the 16/9-ish interval included)...so if it tricked you into thinking it &quot;was 12TET&quot;, there&apos;s good reason...</p><p>--- On Sun, 2/13/11, john777music &lt;<a href="mailto:jfos777@yahoo.com">jfos777@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
