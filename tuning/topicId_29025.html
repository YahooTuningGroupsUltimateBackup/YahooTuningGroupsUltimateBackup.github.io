A diaschisma is ~45.11 cents, while two<br/>Pythagorean commas of ~23.46 cents each add up to ~46.92 cents.</p><p>However, these two measures are rather close, close enough at any rate<br/>for a rule a thumb that the limma or diatonic semitone (the minor<br/>semitone) is equal to about 4/9-tone, and the apotome or chromatic<br/>semitone (the major semitone) to about 5/9-tone.</p><p>I would not take such an approximation, in itself, as evidence for<br/>53-tET or the like, although we might indeed define 53-tET as the<br/>tuning where a whole-tone is in fact equal to precisely nine commas,<br/>with a limma (five fifths down) of 4/9-tone and an apotome (seven<br/>fifths up) of 5/9 tone. Here the medieval-like &quot;diaschisma&quot; of<br/>2/9-tone is equal to precisely two commas as well as half of a limma.</p><p>By the 17th century, 53-tET is being described, with Mercator and Kircher<br/>often mentioned as early advocates.</p><p>The &quot;nine commas&quot; question raises a more general point: other<br/>divisions of the tone into an even number of commas or dieses can also<br/>have more than one reading. Paul, you have discussed this very<br/>important point.</p><p>Thus the division of the tone into five equal dieses can describe<br/>either 29-tET (one reading of Marchettus of Padua, 1318), or some<br/>precise or approximate 31-tET (Vicentino, 1555, who may have<br/>implemented his division with a 31-note cycle of 1/4-comma meantone).</p><p>The division of the tone into three thirdtones can likewise describe<br/>either 17-tET or 19-tET.</p><p>The division into seven parts might describe either 41-tET or 43-tET.</p><p>Sometimes this kind of situation can be further complicated by a<br/>theorist&apos;s not-so-conventional use of terminology.</p><p>Marchettus, for example, in presenting his equal (or unequal?)<br/>fivefold division of the tone, says that an &quot;enharmonic&quot; semitone is<br/>equal to two parts, and a &quot;diatonic&quot; semitone to three parts.</p><p>This language, read in the familiar way, can quite naturally suggest a<br/>tuning system leaning toward ratios of 5, in the manner of Renaissance<br/>meantone or 5-limit JI systems, with large diatonic semitones and<br/>small chromatic semitones as a characteristic feature.</p><p>However, we find that Marchettus actually defines his &quot;enharmonic<br/>semitone&quot; as the usual limma (e.g. B-C), and the &quot;diatonic semitone&quot;<br/>as the usual apotome (e.g. Bb-B).</p><p>In more conventional language, he is describing a &quot;diatonic semitone&quot;<br/>(i.e. limma) of two parts, and a larger &quot;chromatic semitone&quot;<br/>(i.e. apotome) of three parts.</p><p>This definition of the limma as _smaller_ than the apotome, to use his<br/>own more familiar terms, suggests some approximation and possibly some<br/>accentuation of the usual Pythagoraen tuning, moving if anything in<br/>the opposite direction from that of Renaissance 5-limit systems (just<br/>or meantone).</p><p>Returning to the &quot;nine comma&quot; question, just how far back the<br/>approximation of the Pythagorean limma and apotome as 4/9-tone and<br/>5/9-tone goes is a very interesting question.</p><p>Another question: might 55-tET have had appeal for theorists around<br/>1700, or a bit later, in part because it neatly reverses an earlier<br/>tradition, as you have pointed out, Paul, by keeping the ninefold<br/>division but defining the _diatonic_ semitone as 5/9-tone and the<br/>chromatic semitone as 4/9-tone.</p><p>One article, in a book on music theory as I recall, traces how the<br/>&quot;fivefold division&quot; of Marchettus was used by some Renaissance theorists<br/>who did the same thing: the diatonic semitone (in the usual meaning) was<br/>now 3/5-tone, and the chromatic semitone 2/5-tone.
