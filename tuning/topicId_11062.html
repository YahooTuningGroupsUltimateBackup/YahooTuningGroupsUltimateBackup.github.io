See my comments to Graham.</p><p>Well, if you take the two sizes of semitone, 4 steps and 5 steps of 53-tET,<br/>and try to use them as the meantone chromatic semitone and diatonic<br/>semitone, respectively, your meantone &quot;octave&quot; will contain 5*4 + 7*5 = 55<br/>steps of 53-tET. A bit of an overshoot, shall we say?</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We have moved!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
