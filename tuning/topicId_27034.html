Revue de Musicologie Vol. 80/2, 1994, 283-298,<br/>in particular p.298.</p><p>*<br/>1 Werckmeister knows that by tempering a perfect fifth smaller<br/>by 370/369, reduces it by 1/5 Pythagorean comma. Check the<br/>calculation above if you don&apos;t believe. Then Werckmeister must -<br/>notionally and mathematically - been even more thoroughly familiar<br/>with the distinction Pythagoeran/Syntonic comma. The accuracy<br/>of 370/369 is astounding. Sorge has published this efficient and<br/>simple method of how to calculate, in one of his treatises.<br/>(pertaining to &quot;Baroque elementary mathematics&quot;).</p><p>2 The Tables Werckmeister presents about the deviations of the thirds<br/>in the various systems, (as depending on the fifths&apos; temperament),<br/>from pure, are neither in units of Syntonic, nor in Pythagorean-comma<br/>fractions!!<br/>Many writers have misunderstood that essential fact, accepted without<br/>any objection by uncritical readers; probably non-mathematicians.</p><p>In &quot;wohltemprirt&quot;, as an example and illustration for clarification,<br/>the third C-E is enlarged by about 2.8 cent. (NOT equal to P/5)</p><p>The fifths are reduced by about 1/5 P. Werckmeister would have written</p><p>(see Facsimile, Musicalische Temperatur, p. 78ff.,)</p><p>in his book in this case: the third is enlarged by 1/5 comma!!<br/>Try to verify that by yourself in detail. By COMMA Werckmeister meant<br/>in this context just any  MICRO-INTERVAL!!<br/>There exits no neutral comma with Werckmeister, but he utilizes<br/>MICRO-INTERVALS of various sizes, whereever necessary.</p><p>*<br/>In one of his later books Werckmeister mentions E.T. and<br/>he associates it with Christian principles: humiliation<br/>(reduced fifths!) and equality (facing God?).<br/>It is known that organ builders, following mean-tone, stuck to mean-tone<br/>and were reluctant to leave it and go for E.T.<br/>Werckmeister would not have missed to recognize the<br/>shortcomings of E.T. for organs.<br/>And he could not refrain from saying somewhat (translated from memory) :<br/>And yet, I hold it that the diatonic keys should remain somewhat<br/>purer than the remote ones. This, IMO, is not really enthusiasm for E.T.!<br/>*<br/>Which typical numbers do belong to &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;?</p><p>The first interval that can be tempered is the fifth - evidently not<br/>the octave on the harpsichord. Therefore, the tempering of the fifth,<br/>i.e. those that are tempered - is a characteristic quantity. The 21st<br/>century would express this parameter as 4.7 cent. By the way, the<br/>cent is a measuring unit extremely appropriate for and invented<br/>because of Equal Temperament; tailored to E.T.</p><p>But today, as well as in Werckmeister&apos;s and Bach&apos;s times, the pure<br/>intervals were expressed as rationes superparticulares, the<br/>superparticular ratios, (N+1)/N: octave 2/1, Fifth 3/2, etc.,<br/>4/3, 5/4, 6/5, etc. ...</p><p>Werckmeister also mentioned some temperings expressed as<br/>superparticular ratios.</p><p>Thus,  the fifths of &quot;Bach/wohltemperirt&quot; are tempered by the<br/>superparticular ratio of 369, being 370/369. This fraction follows<br/>as the first approximant via continued fractions to the fifth,<br/>amounting to 1,495953506243... Provided the fifth has this value, its<br/>corresponding third (from these tempered fifths c-g-d-a-e) and<br/>the fifth itself in the central C-major triad beat at the UNISON.</p><p>The Four Duets measure 369 bars, etc, see:</p><p>Kellner, H.A.: How Bach quantified his well-tempered tuning within the Four<br/>Duets.
