Their hearts and<br/>ears were dazed, and they lost their normal<br/>condition.). Verses 3588-3595, my translation.</p><p>In the very same passage, mention is made of Tristan&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>playing technique. He &iuml;&iquest;&half;ruorte&iuml;&iquest;&half; and &iuml;&iquest;&half;sluoc&iuml;&iquest;&half; (V. 3553)<br/>the instrument, which means he both plucked single<br/>notes and was strumming chords with all fingers, and<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;sus nam er sinen plectrum:<br/>nagel unde seiten zoher,<br/>diese niderer, jene hoher,<br/>rehte als er si wollte han.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>(he took his tuning key and turned the tuning pegs,<br/>lowering and raising the string pitches as he liked<br/>it) Verses 3558-2561.</p><p>Why am I citing this? Because, while we don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t have any<br/>record of early &iuml;&iquest;&half;Celtic&iuml;&iquest;&half; harp tuning, at least the<br/>passage shows that Tristan was playing both melodies<br/>and chords with his instrument, and that he was an<br/>early member of this group.<br/>Michael</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/>How much free photo storage do you get?
