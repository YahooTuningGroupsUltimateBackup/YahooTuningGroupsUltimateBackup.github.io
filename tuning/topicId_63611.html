The concept of shruti is, first of all and most of all, a matter of<br/>aesthetics.</p><p>2. To support this concept the well-known experiment of two vina-s was<br/>devised. This experiment, leading to the derivation of 22 shruti-s,<br/>continued to depend upon the ear of the musician.</p><p>3. I do not recall to have read in any authentic Sanskrit text that<br/>the 22 shruti-s are equal. Any assumption as to their equality is an<br/>unwarranted assumption that we can, in my opinion, eventually, support<br/>(or reject) theoretically.</p><p>4. I do not recall to have read in any authentic Sanskrit text that<br/>22 is the absolute maximum number of shruti-s to the octave. I have<br/>not felt that the texts emphasise the number 22 to the complete<br/>exclusion of other possibilities. For example, if someone with an<br/>extremely sensitive ear were to say that he can hear more shruti-s<br/>than 22, I do not think Bharat Muni or Sharngadeva would have<br/>ridiculed such a claim. The very importance of &quot;meend&quot; (glissando) as<br/>an embellishment in Indian music should lead us to the implied<br/>possibility of the presence of a larger number of shruti-s.</p><p>5. In the 14th century, Indian music came to be branched into Karnatic<br/>(South Indian) and Hindustani (North Indian) genres. But no event of<br/>great significance took place in the 16th century -- certainly NOT the<br/>demise of the practice of the shruti system.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Wikipedia article on srutis says that the practice of dividing the<br/>&gt; octave into 22 theoretical parts died out in the 16th century.

There&apos;s also a vast distinction between<br/>North (Hindustani) and South (Carnatic) Indian musical cultures that<br/>should be discussed in any such article.</p></div>
