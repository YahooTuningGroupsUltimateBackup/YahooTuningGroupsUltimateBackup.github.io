I also am in<br/>complete agreement with those who stated how much theory they have learned<br/>on this forum. I, for one, am being educated from ground zero up (I have no<br/>training in music or music theory) while doing my &apos;thing&apos; on musical scales<br/>viewed as &apos;distributions&apos; and reporting to this forum whenever there is a<br/>break through. I have read with interest every single post on this list<br/>since my inception many months ago and saved many such posts for future<br/>reference. This forum has been an extremely efficient &apos;school&apos; for me to<br/>learn about the fine points of music theory at my own pedestrian pace.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen! I plead with each and every one of you! Please do not<br/>abandon ship at its most productive and flourishing stage. Seperatism, in<br/>my humble judgement, is a non-solution. Every post to this list is a<br/>significant contribution in its own way to music and music theory. The<br/>useful &apos;fall-out&apos; may not be immediate, and there may be some delay in the<br/>absorption process.<br/>From some of the comments I have been reading lately, it appears this forum<br/>might be taking up the &apos;slack&apos; between what is offered at music schools and<br/>the way things really are in the musical universe of performing<br/><a href="http://musicians.In">musicians.In</a> my personal experience based on my own research, the<br/>correlation between what is currently being taught at conservatories of<br/>Turkish music in Turkey and the actual music performed by indisputable<br/>master musicians is &apos;weak&apos;, to put it mildly.</p><p>Let us join in for many endless debates and exchange of ideas/information<br/>on this forum. Keep up the spirit you all.<br/>Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>1255 Dauphin Street<br/>Mobile, AL 36604<br/>USA</p><p>Phone:  (334) 441-2126<br/>  Fax:  (334) 441-3290<br/>  Web:  <a href="http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/">http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/</a></p></div>
