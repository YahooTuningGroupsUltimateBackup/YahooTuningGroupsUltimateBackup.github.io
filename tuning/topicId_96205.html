Also the notes should go with 1/1 as well. Here are the *good* harmony intervals (according to my own taste)...</p><p>9/8, 8/7, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 9/7, 4/3, 11/8, 7/5, 10/7, 3/2, 11/7, 8/5, 5/3, 12/7, 7/4, 9/5, 11/6, 13/7, 2/1.</p><p>I worked out how many good intervals (an octave or less wide over 12 keys) occur in the following four scales.</p><p>In joint third place is the Quarter Comma Meantone scale Mike gave me and the Blue JI in 31EDO Igs gave me. They both yield 90 good intervals within 6.776 cents (256/255) accuracy.</p><p>In second place is Gene&apos;s Blue JI in 197 eq which yields 91 good intervals within 6.776 cents accuracy.</p><p>The winner, by a margin of 6, is Blue Temperament with 97 good intervals within 6.776 cents accuracy.</p><p>So I don&apos;t have to eat my hat.</p><p>John.</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2011 10:08:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The winner, by a margin of 6, is Blue Temperament with 97 good intervals within 6.776<br/>&gt; cents accuracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I don&apos;t have to eat my hat.</p><p>John, again (since I&apos;m assuming you missed my previous post on this subject): I never said your tuning was a meantone or was equivalent to a meantone.  It is more on par with a well-temperament.  Well-temperaments were quite popular prior to the adoption of 12-TET, and involve a chain of irregularly-tempered fifths that preserve some of the pure harmonies of meantone but lessen the &quot;wolf&quot; intervals by tuning some of the fifths wider than the 1/4-comma fifths.  All well-temperaments have some increased level of good intervals over 1/4-comma meantone, and there is a whole spectrum of well-temperaments between 1/4-comma meantone and 12-TET.  Your temperament clearly falls in this category, which is a centuries-old category.</p><p>Again, I advise you to check out this link:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament</a></p><p>for a few popular examples from the late 1600&apos;s.  These are more &quot;extreme&quot; temperaments than yours, but yield more playable keys.  There were LOADS of well-temperaments in use throughout that historical period, and it&apos;s entirely likely that someone back then considered a temperament like yours.  However, your temperament offers only a very slight improvement over meantone, and I suspect the people in that day (and perhaps this day as well) would be unlikely to consider the improvement enough to warrant adoption, since the most popular WT&apos;s offered a much larger increase in playable intervals.</p><p>And, as I&apos;ve stated before: they all fell before 12-tET, superior harmonies be damned.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2011 12:39:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; John, again (since I&apos;m assuming you missed my previous post on this subject): I never said your tuning was a meantone or was equivalent to a meantone.
