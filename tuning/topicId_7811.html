I can&apos;t imagine &quot;locking in&quot;<br/>&gt;  on such high ratios. I&apos;m perfectly willing to relinquish that domain to the<br/>&gt;  instrumental number crunchers. &gt;&gt;</p><p>DWolf offered:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such ratios are reached by way of simple relationships - 45/32 is 5:4 above<br/>&gt; 9/8 and 16:15 below 3/2, 27/16 a 9:8 above 3/2 and a 3:2 above 9/8.  In such<br/>&gt; cases, the 1/1 drone becomes not an immediate reference pitch but rather a<br/>&gt; long-term one and other tones in the drone become more important.</p><p>Thanks........I think. I&apos;ll have to stare at this awhile and see if anything<br/>comes into focus.</p></div>
