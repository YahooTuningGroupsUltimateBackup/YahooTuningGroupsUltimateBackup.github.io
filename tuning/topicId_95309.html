I had a quick look.<br/>It&apos;s beyond my expertise to evaluate whether their results<br/>are correct.  My gut feeling is that the appeal to dynamical<br/>systems is unjustified.  &apos;Hey, Helmholtz thought residue<br/>was caused by nonlinearities, and even though his proposal<br/>was wrong maybe we can save it!&apos;  Just how hard is it to get<br/>one of these fancy oscillators to reproduce the psychoacoustic<br/>data?  I don&apos;t know.  Would be a good question for John<br/>Starrett, but I don&apos;t think he reads the list these days.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2011 9:06:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry for my lack of reply.

I kept lowering the 1&apos;s until they<br/>were gone. Although this took a few times to get the hang of it, I<br/>could eventually hear the 3&apos;s still as 3&apos;s, even when the 1 was<br/>totally removed - that is, I heard the phantom 1 although the only<br/>thing that was playing was a single sinusoid at 3.</p><p>Nonlinear models don&apos;t generally predict that this is possible, but<br/>something like harmonic entropy does - a single sine wave could be<br/>1/1, or 2/2, or 3/3, etc. Although 1/1 is most probable, you can hear<br/>it as something else under different circumstances (e.g. priming,<br/>which is the trick I used here).</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
