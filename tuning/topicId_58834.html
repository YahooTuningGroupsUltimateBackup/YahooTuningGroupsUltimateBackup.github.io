How could anyone discredit it? Even<br/>if numbers had never been invented, we would still be able to _hear_<br/>the specialness of the intervals that we call &quot;just&quot;. You can choose<br/>to use them or not use them, but you can&apos;t deny their existence.</p><p>One reason I sometimes point out this tolerance is to show the<br/>inadequacy of _definitions_ of JI that describe it simply as &quot;tuning<br/>by ratios&quot; without mentioning that justness is primarily something you<br/>can _hear_, and that many complex ratios do not sound just at all, or<br/>sound just only because of their proximity to simpler ratios.</p><p>It&apos;s funny you should mention errors in tuning of ETs, as I was<br/>pointing some out just yesterday in the MakeMicroMusic group.<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/9827">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/9827</a></p><p>It&apos;s a pity ET and JI are often seen as a dichotomy since (a) some ETs<br/>are JI, e.g. 171-ET, and (b) there are many &quot;middle paths&quot; between ET<br/>and JI such as Erv Wilson&apos;s linear tunings (LT) and their MOS.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; There was a  reference where it was pointed out that there is a<br/>&gt; tolerance of error, in JI that occurs more often than not. .
