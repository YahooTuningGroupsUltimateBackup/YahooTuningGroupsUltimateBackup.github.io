But I&apos;m having a bit of trouble<br/>&gt;correlating some of the entropy dips with my perception of interval<br/>&gt;concordance.</p><p>&gt;Compare, for example, 5/4 and 4/3 from the first octave, to their<br/>&gt;counterparts, 5/2 and 8/3, in the second octave.  The curve shows 4/3<br/>&gt;as having less entropy then 5/4, but 8/3 as having more entropy than<br/>&gt;5/2.  What does this mean?</p><p>This certainly accords with classical theory -- a perfect eleventh<br/>&quot;resolves&quot; to a major tenth. However, since octave-equivalence is so strong,<br/>the octave-equivalent version of this curve that I keep talking about (on<br/>the Monz page, for instance) may be more appropriate for your purposes.</p><p>&gt;Does this really make tuning sense?  That is, is it more important to<br/>&gt;tune 4/3 close to true than 5/4, yet LESS important to tune 8/3 close<br/>&gt;to true than 5/2?</p><p>Well, the slopes are not that different, but to be honest, my perception<br/>agrees with the harmonic entropy curve here. 5:2 definitely has a stronger<br/>pull than 5:4, and 4:3 has a stronger pull than 8:3. In particular, 8:3 does<br/>have a minute but noticable tendency to &quot;slip&quot; into 11:4. Again, many<br/>musical purposes will make it more convenient to use an octave-equivalent<br/>formulation . . . I&apos;ll get to it when I get a chance . . .</p></div>
