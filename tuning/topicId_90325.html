Were tibetan bowls used by the tibetan for sound healing as they are today, who knows ?<br/>&quot;In my humble imagination&quot;, subharmonic scales sound Aztec !<br/>When everything is gone, inspired musicians - if possible microtonalists - is our only hope for reviving lost ancient music...<br/>Years ago I heard precolombian-inspired microtonal music, I forgot the name of the musician but I thought it was very evocative.<br/>May be someone here know about such trials ? and Lou Harrison or Harry Partch&apos;s Aztec scales ? I am curious to know about them !<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
