Several nineteenth-century violin<br/>teachers, however, including one of Joachim&apos;s teachers, explicitly<br/>recommended shading pitches in the direction of their &quot;attachment&quot;,<br/>as defined by harmonic context, in order to achieve an &quot;animated&quot;<br/>performance. In other words, they explained this practice in terms of<br/>the structure of music, not in terms of the structure of stringed<br/>instruments. We might call such a system &quot;functional intonation&quot;. In<br/>such a system, tendency tones, such as the leading tone and the<br/>seventh of the dominant-seventh chord, are inflected in the direction<br/>of their tendency to resolve, diatonic half steps are smaller than<br/>chromatic half steps, and sharped notes are higher than<br/>enharmonically equivalent flatted notes. Present-day string<br/>intonation seems to follow this nineteenth-century practice. And the<br/>present author&apos;s observation is that other non-keyboard performers of<br/>our own time tend to play these small half steps. According to Louis<br/>Richardson, Pablo Casals called the hightening of melodic tendencies<br/>through intonation &apos;la justess expressive&apos; (expressive intonation).&quot;</p><p>Later I&apos;ll try to post summaries of this article&apos;s point on the<br/>teaching of intonation shortly _before_ Mozart (that is, by those who<br/>would have influenced Mozart and his father), and of course by Mozart<br/>himself. The short answers are:</p><p>Before Mozart -- Meantone temperament, specifically something close<br/>to 55-tone equal temperament;<br/>Mozart -- Meantone temperament, but M. was unspecific as to the exact<br/>amount of tempering.</p></div><h3><a id=23960 href="#23960">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 4:46:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Before Mozart -- Meantone temperament, specifically something close<br/>&gt; to 55-tone equal temperament;</p><p>So you mean somewhere between 1/6 and 1/5 comma, i.e. away from 1/4<br/>comma in the direction of 12-tET (1/11 comma)?</p></div><h3><a id=23963 href="#23963">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 4:54:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>These two passages appear to contradict each other. the first says<br/>&quot;harmonic context&quot;, the second &quot;melodic tendencies&quot;.

Only the compromise tuning used at the keyboard [well-<br/>temperaments] are called &apos;temperaments&apos; in these sources. In fact,<br/>the writers of these sources were so unconscious of alternatives to<br/>what we call &apos;meantone temperament&apos; for the uncompromised tuning of<br/>non-keyboard instruments that they had no name for this system at<br/>all; they thought of what we call &apos;meantone temperament&apos; simply as<br/>correct intonation. [Not surprising since it had flourished since the<br/>late fifteenth century.] But let us now examine these sources more<br/>specifically.</p><p>&quot;Leopold Mozart refers to Tosi in general terms as an authoritative<br/>source in a letter to Wolfgang from Salzburg dated June 11, 1778.<br/>Tosi, in 1723, considered the correct tuning system to be what we<br/>would today call a form of regular meantone temperament with more<br/>than twelve notes to the octave, or what we might call for<br/>short &apos;extended regular meantone temperament&apos;. He says that this<br/>temperament should be employed by bowed instruments. Tosi does not<br/>tell us specifically what tuning one would expect to find on the<br/>keyboard instruments of his time, but only that they are not capable<br/>of playing more than twelve notes to the octave without split<br/>keys. . . . according to Tosi, the large diatonic half step is<br/>theoretically equal to five ninths of a whole step, and the small<br/>chromatic half step is theoretically four-ninths of a whole step.<br/>Tosi thereby divides the octave into fifty-five equal parts [Monz,<br/>take note]. This is equivalent to tempering the perfect fifth by<br/>approximately one-sixth of a &apos;comma,&apos; [footnote explains that this is<br/>approximately correct with regard to either Tosi&apos;s comma (=1/55<br/>octave), the syntonic comma, or the pythagorean comma] . . . Many<br/>other divisions were considered in the eighteenth century, as were<br/>irregular keyboard tuning systems that do not divide the octave into<br/>a multitude of equal parts, but the fifty-five-part division had<br/>prominent adherents. Georg Andreas Sorge, in particular, attributed<br/>it to Telemann, explaining that in its complete state it could not be<br/>used on the clavier; but it might be applied to the violin and to<br/>certain wind instruments and was easiest for singers. In its<br/>incomplete state, Sorge attributed the fifty-five-part division to<br/>the organ builder, Gottfried Silbermann. According to Mark Lindley,<br/>Sauveur and his editor Fontanelle, writing ca. 1700, described the<br/>1/6-comma temperament as that most favored by musicians in general,<br/>as distinguished from keyboard musicians in particular, some of whom<br/>tuned differently. The 1/6-comma temperament is the one implied by<br/>T&uuml;rk&apos;s statement of 1791, previously cited from Boyden, that sharps<br/>are a &apos;comma&apos; lower than the equivalent flats; it also seems to be<br/>the most common basis fro the irregular temperaments described by<br/>Barbour in _Tuning and Temperament_.</p><p>&quot;Although the Mozarts, certainly Leopold Mozart, seem to have been<br/>very well read, no mention of Quantz is found in their writings. We<br/>shall discuss him here, however, as an important figure continuing<br/>the tradition of Tosi. Quantz, in his flute method of 1752, advocates<br/>a tuning system for the flute identical to that recommended by Tosi.<br/>He gives the flutist a wealth of practical advice on how to obtain<br/>correct intonation, even suggesting a mechanical improvement for the<br/>flute, but admits that only a minority of flutists of his time<br/>observed those rules. Most of his contemporary flutists he considered<br/>to be quite bad, not even knowing how to obtain a pleasant tone<br/>quality on high notes. Quantz tells us that keyboard instruments, not<br/>being able to make pitch distinctions in the manner of the flute,<br/>resort to tempering [i.e., well-tempering] . . .</p><p>&quot;Leopold Mozart, in his violin method of 1756 -- which happens to be<br/>the year of Wolfgang&apos;s birth -- also describes what we have<br/>called &apos;extended regular meantone temperament&apos; as the correct<br/>intonation for the violin; he tells us that keyboard instruments of<br/>his time were played with some form of tempered [i.e., well-tempered]<br/>tuning, but that in the &quot;right ratio&quot; [i.e., meantone] tuning that he<br/>recommends for the violin, flats are higher by a comma than<br/>enharmonically equivalent sharps. It can be shown that for whichever<br/>of the standard commas we choose, the perfect fifths in Leopold<br/>Mozart&apos;s system were theoretically flattened by about one-sixth of<br/>that comma . . . Leopold Mozart wrote down a couple of scales<br/>specifically intended for practice in intonation, one leading through<br/>the flats, the other through the sharps. In practicing these scales,<br/>the student is supposed to learn to distinguish between the large<br/>diatonic half steps and the small chromatic half steps. It is<br/>important to emphasize that these scales are not abstractions but<br/>exercises to be mastered . . .</p><p>&quot;That the use of keyboard accompaniment for the strings was<br/>conditional, and not inevitable, is implicit in Leopold Mozart&apos;s own<br/>discussion of the subject. The point is also illustrated by an<br/>anecdote of Andr&eacute; Schachtner. According to Schachtner, immediately<br/>after the Mozarts&apos; return from Vienna early in 1763, Wolfgang, to the<br/>astonishment of those present, took part in playing certain trios by<br/>Wentzel, even though he had had no instruction in the violin.<br/>Schachtner names the musicians taking part -- Leopold Mozart<br/>performed the bass part, Wentzl played first violin, and Schachtner<br/>himself (later Wolfgang) played second violin. Schachtner makes no<br/>mention of any keyboard accompanist. According to James Webster, &apos;the<br/>evidence that the continuo had been abandoned in secular Austrian<br/>chamber music by 1750 is overwhelming.&apos; For this reason, the problem<br/>of reconciling the pitch of keyboard and non-keyboard instruments<br/>would not have arisen very often in small ensembles in W. A. Mozart&apos;s<br/>time. And Quantz tells us that these fine distinctions of pitch are<br/>only perceptible in small ensembles, so the problem of reconciling<br/>the pitch of the two types of instrument can be disregarded where the<br/>clavier plays with a full orchestra, as in Mozart&apos;s piano concertos.</p><p>[...]</p><p>&quot;Horst Walter reports that surprisingly late in the eighteenth<br/>century there were still attempts to circumvent the physical<br/>limitations of the keyboard that normally require compromise tunings<br/>of enharmonically equivalent sharps and flats. The Londoner, Charles<br/>Clagget, invented a piano tuned without such compromise temperament,<br/>providing unaltered chromatic tones with pedals (operating like the<br/>pedals of a harp, according to Lindley). Joseph Haydn visited<br/>Clagget&apos;s shop in 1792 and reportedly gave high praise to Clagget&apos;s<br/>improvements on the piano and harpsichord (which was apparently still<br/>in use in 1792). In October of 1796, there was a demonstration in<br/>Vienna of a new kind of piano built by Johann Jakob K&ouml;nnicke in 1795<br/>according to the plans of Johann Georg Roser, music director of the<br/>cathedral in Linz. Beethoven, Joseph Haydn, and several music<br/>directors and composers are said by Roser&apos;s son, Franz de Paula<br/>Roser, to have played on this piano, a six-manual instrument with a<br/>range of six octaves that allowed playing in all keys in their pure<br/>[i.e., meantone] tuning . . .
