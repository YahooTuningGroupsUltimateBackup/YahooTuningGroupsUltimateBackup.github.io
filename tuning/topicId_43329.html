He<br/>wrote last:</p><p>Ibo: Hi Johnny and all<br/>this my last statement on this matter here<br/>I ask the list to judge everyone for himself from the arguments<br/>exchanged here.</p><p>From my side the discussion is closed, since Johnny Reinhard<br/>doesn&apos;t present any evidence to support his case.</p><p>JR: And so I now have the opportunity to shed more light on the Bach research<br/>I have become involved with, along with my other microtonal activities.</p><p>Ibo: At the end of this letter I say<br/>I have better things to do than to keep up this until now useless<br/>discussion - I&apos;ll turn back to scientific research on temperament<br/>practice.</p><p>Best<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>--------------</p><p>JR: And now Part I of Evidence.</p><p>Ibo: In this case - Werckmeister for example:<br/>He designed his (today) best known temperament (W III) with<br/>1/4-p.comma division not as the one and only temperament,<br/>gernerally to be used, but for the irregular modes or the &quot;Genus<br/>Chromaticum&quot;.</p><p>JR: And since Bach used all 12 notes in so many of his compositions, he<br/>required &quot;Genus Chromaticum.&quot;  This is especially true for organists notable<br/>for improvisation.  The inflexibility of organ tuning mitigates for a single<br/>organ tuning, and Werckmeister III is singularly admirable.  Any organ<br/>composition that used an Ab is likely to be well-tempered since G# was the<br/>more usual key allocation in meantone.</p><p>Ibo: I appreciate your musicianship. But what exactly do you need the<br/>ttravels then for, if you already from your excellence as musician<br/>believe to be able to draw conclusions about the history of<br/>temperament practice?</p><p>JR: You are putting words into my mouth (yech).  I draw no conclusions by<br/>making musical performances alone.  At best, they are the satisfactory result<br/>of much research.  If you would be a bit patient, I will respond to your<br/>points, while making a few of my own.</p><p>Ibo: As a musician I believe, that we can&apos;t get enough histoorical<br/>information - and then make an artistic decision when it comes to<br/>the performance. Usually we have only a fraction of the knowledge<br/>of a specific historic situation or historic condition. It can&apos;t<br/>be expressed in numbers, but as a magnitude or proportion, one<br/>reasonably will not exceed more than 1% of the total necessary<br/>knowledge. This means that in the magnitude of 99 % &quot;modern&quot;<br/>thoughts, prejudices and preferences will come into any<br/>performance, making any performance automatically a modern<br/>performance.</p><p>JR: That is a bleak assessment in my judgment.  Using numbers allows for<br/>accuracy to 1200 cents to the octave.  This puts all temperaments on the same<br/>table, for easy cross examination.  The music is the form that results, and<br/>is the ultimate reason for your research.</p><p>Ibo: At the same time this makes performance always &quot;artistic&quot;, beyond<br/>science or scientific consideration. In other words: I don&apos;t want<br/>to hear experiments (which I&apos;m interested as scientist), but I&apos;m<br/>interested in the artistic result (as musician, music lover).</p><p>JR: Like you, I don&apos;t want to hear experiments.  For example, I have always<br/>resisted the fast comparison of the same piece being performed in competing<br/>tunings.  However, there is science is the music of Bach, as well.</p><p>For example, an analysis of the Brandenburg Concerti opening melodic<br/>intervals reveals that Bach used four semitones as an opening interval in<br/>four different Concerti.  In each instance, the specific interval used is a<br/>semitone of 108 cents, the largest of four different sizes of semitone in<br/>Werckmeister III.  It makes musical sense to use only the largest semitone<br/>for the opening melodic motive.  This is too much for chance.<br/>There are 39 distinct melodic intervals in Werckmeister III and this is<br/>clearly more important to the musician than to the musicologist.</p><p>Ibo: But from that small and vague performance basis a valid judgment<br/>or an evaluation of a previous historical situation cannot be<br/>drawn. Not even for temperaments.</p><p>JR: This is just your opinion.  Live performance further informs.  It is part<br/>of the process, a necessary part, in my opinion.</p><p>Ibo: Personal preferences for example for a certain temperament are by<br/>definition no evidence - except for the individual, who brings it<br/>forward.</p><p>JR: The above is meaningless in regard to my situation.  You cannot be blamed<br/>for not knowing what my involvement in music has been.</p><p> Ibo: I think it is necessary to &quot;defend&quot; HIP &quot;against its devotees&quot; - by<br/>collecting and constantly widening knowledge. We don&apos;t need believers in the<br/>field who don&apos;t want to see evidence contradicting them, but we need<br/>knowledgeable people who [challenge? JR].</p><p>JR: I above wholeheartedly with the above statement.</p><p>Ibo: Temperament is one field of building historical myths, others are<br/>also fields of mixing individual (historical and modern)<br/>preferences to find explanatory systems, which please us so much<br/>nowadays: &quot;key characteristics&quot;, &quot;rhetorics&quot; and &quot;affects&quot; - and<br/>tempi.</p><p>JR: Sorry to contradict, but history is already practically all-myth<br/>regarding temperament.  &quot;Bach invented equal temperament&quot; is widely believed<br/>throughout history, and it is a myth.<br/>&Oslash; while making one of my travels. His wife Vertrude</p><p>Ibo: Is really &apos;Vertrude&apos; her name?</p><p>JR: Technically, it MUST be Gertrude, but he always said it like it was with<br/>a &quot;V&quot;.<br/>&Oslash; JR: Wasn&apos;t it his pride to write things up because his<br/>&gt; temperament was chosen? Why else?</p><p>Ibo: Yes of course, because as he himself stated in print 1697, that<br/>the organ builders are so stubborn and don&apos;t follow his new<br/>temperament suggestions. Which he by the way constantly changed,<br/>added, admitted change, corrections tec. from book to book which<br/>he published.</p><p>JR: Perhaps, they were not following his suggestions enough?<br/>While the fact that he kept changing through corrections and additions<br/>underscores the fact that W. always referred his readers back to Musicalische<br/>Temperatur of 1691 for further temperament detail.</p><p>&gt; JR: The above is true in Holland, yes: but not Thuringia.</p><p>Ibo: What are your statistics for Thuringia. You just correctly stated<br/>that the area is crowded with churches in many smaller and greater<br/>places. Of how many exactly do you have any evidence about the<br/>status of the organ in Bach&apos;s lifetime 1685-1750?</p><p>JR: My understanding is that organs cannot retain their tuning for over 300<br/>years.  Further, many records regarding church organs have been destroyed as<br/>a result of war.  As the nomenclature for discussing tuning is so flexible,<br/>and has been poorly translated previously to both scholars and musicians, a<br/>new look on tuning practice for the late Baroque is warranted.<br/>&Oslash; Before he was to publish in Quedlinburg he travelled&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.even<br/>&gt; to Amsterdam.</p><p>Ibo: No,<br/>at least if you didn&apos;t find evidence for that in some archive -<br/>that would be really exciting!</p><p>JR: I noticed that Werckmeister used Dutch terms in some of his writing.<br/>Particularly, I recall the Dutch word for the comma.  (Frau Lichtwitz<br/>translated trough different Werckmeister books.) The Dutch trip is now<br/>relegated to a hunch. It would make sense for a young Werckmeister to check<br/>out the environs of Sweelink.<br/>&Oslash; He was a Johnny<br/>&gt; Appleseed of tuning ideas he had called a natural consequence<br/>&gt; of Praetorian quarter-comma meantone. He doesn&apos;t claim to<br/>&gt; originate the idea, not does he name it.</p><p>Ibo: Which idea? Meantone -temperament? He couldn&apos;t claim that, since<br/>it was in use before Praetorius 1619, and before Zqarlino&apos;s<br/>description in 1571 and before Pietro A(a)ron and before Ramis de<br/>Parejas practical description in 1482.</p><p>JR: This is what concerns me: the idea is a circular well-temperament.  Why<br/>do you characterize Werckmeister about making pompous claims?<br/>Werckmeister calls meantone-temperament &quot;Praetorian tuning&quot; with all possible<br/>respect to Praetorious.  Though this was listed &quot;second&quot; as Werckmeister II,<br/>it is just a category of common tuning&mldr;though of an earlier tradition (or<br/>generation).</p><p>&Oslash; In fact we don&apos;t have a face to put on him.</p><p>Ibo: [Probably people today would think it to be funny, too, like his<br/>language]</p><p>JR: I wouldn&apos;t. J</p><p>&gt;&gt;The organ builder Wender of Muhlhausen preferred to use<br/>&gt;&gt;Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Ibo: No, bad methods occur in any science - actually often they can&apos;t<br/>be considered to be science, but novel writing.</p><p>JR: I guess the question, then, is why did Bach-archiv publish such bad<br/>musicology, then?<br/>&gt; There was no one before Werckmeister to present a tuning<br/>&gt; that would do what was musically necessary.</p><p>Ibo: Take the differenciating view of the Bremen cDom (cathedral)<br/>organist Grave who advocated 1755 for keeping the meantone<br/>temperament in the (Schnitger)-organ, because it is better for the<br/>liturgical function the organ, though he says that he would<br/>prefer ET for accompanying the ensemble music (a pattern of<br/>argument, which we find in Mattheson&apos;s and other writer&apos;s<br/>publications already around 1730). However he states, that the<br/>ensemble music is not as important issue in his church, so the<br/>&quot;Praetorian&quot; temperament should be kept. The organ was retuned 20<br/>years later - direct to ET! (A bunch of similar cases and<br/>arguments are known to me).</p><p>JR: This is an interesting example.  As a performer, it is at the opposite<br/>end of what music means.  Grave would not use the organ with<br/>instrumentalists.  That&apos;s a good, specific example.  It may be the exception<br/>that proves the rule: that organs more often DO play with instrumentalists.<br/>And that this is an important function.</p><p>Ibo: How would we &quot;characterize&quot; Mr. Grave:<br/>- &quot;conservative&quot; because he let&apos;s the meantone temperament<br/>stay in the organ, since it serves well the required<br/>or recognized function (in the liturgy)<br/>- &quot;progressive&quot; as he propses equal temperament for ensemble<br/>music accompaniment<br/>- &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;opportunistic&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; as he judges in<br/>general from the function of the organ</p><p>JR: I would say conservative, non-progressive (because he likely never heard<br/>exact equal temperament&mldr;s. Jorgensen), and &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; (not part of your<br/>choices.<br/>&Oslash; In some likelihood, Bach&apos;s uncle Johann Christoph Bach<br/>&gt; may have had one of those &quot;bumps&quot; into the 3-year younger<br/>&gt; Werckmeister</p><p>JR: JC Bach (uncle) frequented Muhlhausen at a time when Werckmeister was<br/>studying latin in Nordhausen, (born in just outside, Benneckenstein).  By<br/>driving to Nordhausen I got a good sense of the distances.  Muhlhausen is<br/>quite next to Nordhausen.  How could these two miss meeting each other?</p><p>&Oslash; JR: Have you never heard the difference between<br/>&gt; equal tempered Buxtehude and Werckmeister III tuned<br/>&gt; Buxtehude? It is night and day.</p><p>Ibo: Hear hear! I tuned these myself frequently, and with some pieces<br/>W III gives a fine result, with others even ET works, others again<br/>don&apos;t reject a Vallotti ... Some work in every surrounding.</p><p>JR: Here we have a problem.  I don&apos;t care if ET works.  Nor could I entertain<br/>Valotti (which appears after Bach died) for Buxtehude.  This is slipshod, and<br/>unnecessary.  As a composer, I believe a composer has a more precise image in<br/>the mind than many a player can render under the best of circumstances.  I<br/>think it is important that the tuning basis of a composer be honored.  Hence,<br/>the drive to determine tunings for each composer.</p><p>Ibo: Plus, the voicing, registration and the room can do incredible<br/>much to lead astray even experiencesd people.  So what could we gain from our<br/>today&apos;s listening experience - where we already do not agree. How would you<br/>know that Buxtehude or Werckmeister would agree to your personal prefeerence,<br/>and not to mine?</p><p>JR:  I could convince you if you made a visit to my apartment in New York.  I<br/>would play examples and help you recognize the appropriateness of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s tuning to Buxtehude and how ET fails the composer utterly in<br/>comparison.</p><p>&gt; It is important to point out that every single book<br/>&gt; Werckmeister published through 1707</p><p>Ibo: He died in 1706</p><p>JR: Yes, but his last book was published posthumously by his children in<br/>order to gain some much needed income.</p><p>&gt; refers back to his 1691 publication (which was sold in Leipzig<br/>&gt; and Frankfurt).  He never failed to favor purer intervals in diatonic<br/>&gt; keys.</p><p>Ibo: Yes as he says about ET that he thinks is a good choice, too!<br/>But he admits that he himself would like to keep some thirds<br/>slightly better.</p><p>JR: You don&apos;t see the good politics here?  More significant, he continued to<br/>endorse his own ideas.</p><p>&gt; Incidentally, I just conducted &quot;Where is the newborn<br/>&gt; king of the Jews&quot; in Werckmeister III.</p><p>Ibo: The temperament of the continuo doesn&apos;t play a larger role:<br/>See my contribution on the harpsichord list<br/>&quot;temperament - ensemble intonation&quot;<br/><a href="http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0301&L=hpschd-l&P=R3618">http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0301&L=hpschd-l&P=R3618</a></p><p>JR: I couldn&apos;t disagree more.  But of course, I understand your<br/>misunderstanding.<br/>(Look, I&apos;m sorry to appear arrogant.  But I hope you realize as I do that we<br/>are really only poking a bit of fun at each other in a polemical manner.)</p><p>I read your letters and generally enjoyed them.  To the matters we have been<br/>addressing, I must disagree with this one:</p><p>Ibo (from Harpsichord List) &quot;WTs force the singer/player to a much more<br/>difficult to control intonation, especially in the remote keys (where WTs are<br/>worse than ET).&quot;</p><p>JR: What is more accurate is that Werckmeister III is a case of controlled<br/>expression.  Where a modern musician might use an elastic intonation,<br/>Werckmeister III require head on intonation (in other words, no sliding below<br/>or above notes).  The harpsichord becomes gold.  Every string players huddles<br/>by it to get the exact intonation throughout the concert.</p><p>When everyone know ET, it doesn&apos;t matter much whether you can hear the<br/>harpsichord in a continuo.  But when in W III, string players find it vital.<br/>Your lower expectations will yield lesser results, I&apos;m afraid.</p><p>Ibo: But they can&apos;t consistently be performed by free intonating musicians as<br/>exact to the pitches created by the well-temperament in a<br/>fixed-pitch-instrument like a keyboard instrument.</p><p>JR: Yes they can.  One way is to treat WIII as a 12 note (or less) blues<br/>scale.  Some players actually like the cents values due to their training,<br/>others would run away from them.  But all love to get near the harpsichord.<br/>(I&apos;ve already described the use of tape.)  Trumpets, no problem so far (with<br/>its use of a minor third worth of interval bandwidth).</p><p>Ibo: And the effect of any temperament is and should be masked by the<br/>continuo-group, which to this aim should consist of several<br/>additional bass instruments, like a Viollone, Gamba or caello,<br/>Dulcian or Fagotto, etc. In this way it is better guaranteed,<br/>that the disturbing impure chords* from the keyboard instruments<br/>will not destroy the pure flexible intonation required from the<br/>non-continuo-players (and singers)</p><p>JR: There is nothing impure to mask.  Impurity based on later concepts of<br/>vertical simultanaities do not apply to strict counterpoint.  These are<br/>melodies that need further distinguishing, which Werckmeister III is ideally<br/>suited to accomplish.  When music becomes more chordal, only then do your<br/>ideas of &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; make any sense.  In the Middle Ages, cycle of<br/>fifth tuning was popular in Germany.  Why do you penalize the further keys as<br/>&quot;so bad&quot; when they were part of folk music?<br/>&Oslash; I had to announce to the<br/>&gt; audience that it is quite interesting that the identifying<br/>&gt; name of Werckmeister with tuning was so conservative<br/>&gt; in his actual use of pitch relationships.</p><p>Ibo: I don&apos;t grasp the story. If your singers and players would have<br/>performed in the way descrived by numerous authors of the 17 and<br/>18th century, your audience should not be able to detect what<br/>temperament the keybaord instrument has, as the other musicians<br/>should play as pure as possible (above the lowest sooounding note)<br/>and the rest of the continuo should be loud enough to mask the bad<br/>chords..</p><p>JR: Yes, I read your article.  But I believe you are flat out wrong here.  I<br/>know you don&apos;t like reading this from me. ;)  sorry, but for reasons of music<br/>and historical honesty and the integrity of this list, I have to tell you&mldr;it<br/>&apos;aint so.</p><p>There are no bad chords in C Major in W III so nothing to mask.  Players<br/>played everything exactly as it is tuned on the harpsichord.  Where you would<br/>mask, we would unveil.</p><p>&Oslash; Ibo: Kuhnau worked in Leipzig, - around 1700 this was<br/>&gt; scarcely related to the - quite different - organ building<br/>&gt; practice of Northern Germany which I&apos;m researching.</p><p>&gt; JR: Maybe, but Kuhnau had the same basic interests as<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;and they were likely friends as well.</p><p>Ibo: Obviously all were &quot;friends&quot; who lived in the same time.<br/>I give up on this part. I am sorry: If you can&apos;t prove something,<br/>then don&apos;t think that by repeting it, it will get a better likeliness.</p><p>JR: This information was from Rudiger Pheifer, President of the Werckmeister<br/>Society.  We met together in Wolfenbeutel.  This tuning list allows me to<br/>share ideas a bit more freely than usually done in an academic journal.</p><p>Ibo: Whether someone is biased or not, has to be discussed by evidence.<br/>It is about making the case. Take the &quot;facts&quot; check and double<br/>check them, explain their prerequiites, contradictions, prove as<br/>much as possile their point or disprove it. It has nothing to do<br/>with like or dislike.</p><p>JR: Philosophically, I disagree with you.  We are all biased.  Some of us<br/>admit them to ourselves, some admit them publicly.  It is best to confront<br/>them, for they are present.<br/>&Oslash; JR: We play accurate to the cent whenever possible, at<br/>&gt; least in the mind.</p><p>Ibo: If that is &quot;accurate&quot; as your arguments in this discussion, then<br/>the imagination of good intonation happened probably only in the<br/>minds.</p><p>JR: This was not a joke.  The music we perform on the American Festival of<br/>Microtonal Music is not like usual performances.  When I said &quot;in the minds&quot;<br/>it meant that we hear the intonation crystally clear in the mind before we<br/>play them.  This is the same process for adjusting the thirds and fifths to<br/>an already sounding bass tone, only it works for WIII as well.  I am not sure<br/>it would work for every WT as well.  While WIII has 39 melodic intervals, W<br/>IV-VI all have even more intervals.</p><p>&Oslash; I do not hear that way,</p><p>Ibo: That&apos;s a big problem. A piece of good advice to solve that<br/>problem, which partly spoils this whole discussion:<br/>See to educate your ear as much as possible</p><p>JR: This is really funny.  (What&apos;s the icon for belly laugh?)</p><p>Ibo: I have trained and exercised that for years and I hope such<br/>training will help you to improve your judgment in the future, so<br/>that you to get away from the prejudices, which conceal the<br/>historical evidence to you. You&apos;ll find a fascinating world of<br/>intonation and still can - like I do - keep some other fine<br/>prejudices for the non scientific part of our life.</p><p>JR: &mldr;still chuckling&mldr;</p><p>&Oslash; nor do I suspect Buxtehude did.</p><p>Ibo: You suspect to much.<br/>Scientific reasoning is very much &mldr;In science, however, it can only be<br/>stated, that nothing safe is known.</p><p>JR: Ibo, this is not a science in the usual sense.  If you follow that<br/>reasoning blindly, you will miss important clues.  &quot;Nothing safe is known&quot;<br/>doesn&apos;t do it.  It is not acceptable.  It does not compute.  It is false, and<br/>I am earnestly attempting to get through to you that you are worshipping at a<br/>false god.</p><p>&gt; Nor did Bach.</p><p>Ibo: Here the above suspicion &quot;&quot;I suspect Buxtehude did&quot; turned already<br/>in a factual statement &quot;Bach did&quot;.</p><p>JR: Thanks for noticing.  Yes, after writing a self-publishing my Masters<br/>thesis on Bachs Tuning (which did not make any conclusions), I spent over 2<br/>decades doing further research of all kinds.  BTW, I trained in<br/>Ethnomusicology which is part of my interest in visiting each of the Bach<br/>cities.  There are techniques, strategies, and methodologies involved that<br/>may be new even to you!<br/>&Oslash; Werckmeister is ideal in every way to fit the missing link<br/>&gt; that is Thuringia.</p><p>Ibo: Well, if you think he is ideal, than make the case - your belief<br/>is no proof.</p><p>JR:  I hope this all helps.</p><p>&Oslash; JR: Which is why a theologian like Werckmeister</p><p>Ibo: Now you make him to something he never was: a theologian. (Read his<br/>biography in the literature on Werckmeister, s. above).<br/>No, he was no scientist on (christian) religion, but &quot;only&quot; a believer in his<br/>God, and sometimes also argued from these his preferences and beliefs. Sounds<br/>by now familiar that you bring him into that context.</p><p>JR: According to the Grove Dictionary on Music and Musicians citation on<br/>Werckmeister, paragraph 2 (p. 286):</p><p>2. WORKS.  &quot;Though not educated at a university, Werckmeister was widely read<br/>in classical as well as contemporary literature on theology, mathematics,<br/>philosophy and music.&quot;  Later, &quot;From these writings [his own] he emerges as a<br/>profoundly religious thinker.&quot;  And his books contain religious allegory<br/>prominently.  It was the Bishop of Wolfenbeutel who gave all of Praetorious&apos;<br/>writings to Werckmeister in Halberstadt, long after Praetorious had died.  I<br/>believe this is fair reason for me to have called Werckmeister a theologian.<br/>In his day he was more often considered a mathematician (in some circles).<br/>To others, he&apos;s an organ diagnostician.  Me, I admire his publishing efforts.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Today, tape is may be a solution - But, contradicting is, that I<br/>&gt;&gt; have not seen any good baroque oboe player doing something like<br/>&gt;&gt; that to his instrument.</p><p>&gt; JR: How about Bram Kreeftmeijer of Arnhem. He was my oboist for<br/>&gt; Brandenburg Concerto #2&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;and he used scotch tape that I procured.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: And what kind of tape would you suggest<br/>&gt;&gt; for the practice back then? I thought it is an invention of the<br/>&gt;&gt; 20th century?</p><p>Ibo: OK, But what does Mhr. Kreeftmmeijer may be useful tape-strangling of a<br/>modern oboe for your recent concert have to do with<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s temperament, and whether it was actually applied in<br/>which organ.</p><p>JR: &quot;Strangling&quot; is an interesting characterization, maybe even bias.  I hope<br/>it is not more important for you to be right in these arguments than the<br/>honest understanding and transmittal of the music of Bach and the music of<br/>the organ.</p><p>Actually, Bram Kraftmeijer (please note only a single letter &quot;m&quot; for the<br/>analy retentive) is principle oboist of the Gelders Orchestra of Arnhem in<br/>Nederland, and called last evening.  I mentioned that he is my best example<br/>of someone who uses my scotch tape tuning method.  He informs me that his<br/>section has now used tape now to make them perfectly in tune on some<br/>troublesome intervals.</p><p>Ibo: No historical reports confirm<br/>that beewax-practice in order to reach different interval sizes of<br/>well-temperaments. On the contrary, oboes (like all woodwinds)<br/>were especially required by 18th autors to play as pure as<br/>possible (to the continuo, as described above). The same authors<br/>might advocate in the same sources use of well-temperaments or<br/>even ET in te accompanying keyboard instruments</p><p>JR: Dear Ibo, what about seeing music history as a recorder player, instead<br/>of exclusively like a keyboardist.  We know about beeswax.  And what authors<br/>pray tell?  Or would this conflict with an intention to have said all to be<br/>said on the matter?</p><p>My dear friend (unless you object to my use of the word &quot;friend&quot;), you have a<br/>belief system which you are trying to defend, even as you say that I have a<br/>system of belief based on personal aesthetic preferences.</p><p>If you could imagine that there were many churches in<br/>Thuringia/Anhalt-Sachsen/Saxon areas with keyboards in Werckmeister III, and<br/>that they had enough Bachs in them to prepare them for a master like J.S. to<br/>tickle the keys, than you can further imagine that he would take special care<br/>with the tuning.  He did, based on my research.  (please, be patient)<br/>&Oslash; JR: We certainly have different eyes. I see a whole<br/>&gt; page on Werckmeister and much less on most any<br/>&gt; other personage.</p><p>Ibo: I think physically our eyes are rather alike - if you only take<br/>away your persona-preference-bias-glasses ...<br/>Walther lists on &quot;the whole page&quot; on Werckmeister the latter&apos;s<br/>publications, yes.<br/>But he doesn&apos;t describe any of W.&apos;s temperaments. Neither does he<br/>do so for any other author on temperament!</p><p>JR: Yes, Walther shows bias.  He does not list Handel, for example.  The<br/>reason for not listing a specific temperament for Werckmeister is out of<br/>respect to Werckmeister.  If Werckmeister was not going to insist on a<br/>particular tuning, it would not be for Walther to do so.  As well, if<br/>everyone knew that Werckmeister&apos;s tuning was really what we now call W III,<br/>fully adopted by the Bach family.  Remember the most important Bach in Erfurt<br/>was &quot;Johann Bach&quot; from earlier generations.  And in Gera, and Arnstadt, and in<br/>&mldr;.the list goes on.  Bachs were everywhere.  And Werckmeister III is their<br/>own.  And if you could open up your imagination a bit, you could learn to<br/>like it.</p><p>Ibo: really, its: Schoof!<br/> more recent Buxtehude album, I got it as a personal gift from him ...</p><p>&gt; is that it is a different piece than its equal tempered<br/>&gt; manifestations.<br/>&gt; Sequences have a life that are intended for subtle<br/>&gt; comparison, totally lost in ET.<br/>&gt; People cry at the significant difference.</p><p>Hmm - I regret that. But may be transposition to other keys might<br/>help away from that crying state.</p><p>JR:  Transposition changes sentiment, it is true, for a WT.  However, her<br/>crying was a blessed thing, and she is most happy for the experience.
