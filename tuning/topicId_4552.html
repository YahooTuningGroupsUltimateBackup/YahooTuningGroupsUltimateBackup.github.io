I guess I should ignore comments this stupid,</p><p>Why not- you&apos;ve ignored everything else on this list.  If it takes such<br/>negetive stuff to bring you out, then I am embarrassed.  Please contribute<br/>it to my underexposure, and feel free to share any interesting work you<br/>guys have done.  I am anxious to purchase innovation.  To start, it is<br/>customary to recommend, god forbid sell, recordings.</p><p>My exposure to CCRMA is so limited I can relay it in a paragraph.  First: I<br/>was referred by Carleen Hutchins to Mr. Gary Scavone at the library, who<br/>very helpful and friendly in indicating that it didn&apos;t have the documents I<br/>was looking for.  Second: I made a phone call to inquire about generalized<br/>keyboards, in which I am interested.  I made the call based on some<br/>particularly clear statements in a CCRMA pamphlet I was given at a concert<br/>(of classical acoustic music)- a pamphlet that was, by the way, asking for<br/>money.  The response I got was absolutely and entirely irreconcilable with<br/>the statements in the pamphlet, and was about as rude as I can remember a<br/>phone call being.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
