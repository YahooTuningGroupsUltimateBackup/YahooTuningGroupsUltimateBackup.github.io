The 15 EDO scale has 3<br/>circles of<br/> interlaced fifths with 400 cent thirds already, so, I must be missing<br/>something. The<br/> fifth of 711.111 cents looks good. My concern with altering 15 EDO is<br/>losing the<br/> 560 so it becomes sharper  AND/OR losing the 960 so it becomes flatter.<br/>   Someone wrote to me a while back about using MOS I think. I remember<br/>something<br/> about altering the 15 EDO in a ABC-ABC-ABC-ABC-ABC fashion (I&apos;m sure this<br/>is not the<br/> proper terminology either). Thanks for helping.</p><p>FLASH FLASH FLASH: STEPHEN SZPAK WRITES:</p><p>   Since you haven&apos;t had the time to respond (which is O.K.) I have come up with a<br/>   new scale. I took 15 EDO and trashed it. I created (hope this is right) 5 tonics with<br/>   300 cent minor thirds, 400 cent major thirds and 700 cent fifths. If one uses the tonic<br/>   of C you get a subminor third as well. Plus a sub 4th (461 cents) a semi-augmented 4th<br/>   (561 cents) and a harmonic 7 th at 961 cents.  The goal of all this was 1) to reduce the<br/>   fifths from 720 cents to 700  and 2) to create tonics that are not even close to those in<br/>   12 EDO.  If anyone is interested I might post it.  After all it&apos;s NOT 15 EDO anymore. It&apos;s<br/>   a different scale from 12 EDO AND 15EDO with the advantage of actually being playable<br/>   by someone with average size hands.</p><p>   Looking forward to a response to all this at your convenience. Comments from others<br/>   are welcome as well.</p><p>&gt;Any equal temperament has them.

It&apos;s true that 128:125<br/>is about 41 cents. When we speak of 128;125 vanishing, though, we are<br/>no longer speaking about Just Intonation. We are speaking of some<br/>temperament where all the consonant intervals are adjusted by some<br/>small amount. In Just Intonation, 128:125 is the difference between<br/>three major thirds and an octave (for example). So if we say 128;125<br/>vanishes in some temperament, we mean that the difference between<br/>three major thirds and an octave is zero in that temperament.</p><p>Similarly for 250:243. It&apos;s the difference between three minor thirds<br/>and two fourths (for example). In Just Intonation it happens to be 49<br/>cents. In 12-equal it&apos;s 100 cents. But in 15-equal and some other<br/>temperaments (called &quot;porcupine&quot; temperaments), it&apos;s zero, it<br/>vanishes. This fact leads to new scales and chord progressions that<br/>are, some say, as &quot;natural&quot; in 15-equal (and other porcupine<br/>temperaments) as the diatonic scale and its typical chord<br/>progressions are in 12-equal (and other meantone temperaments).</p><p>The reply to Mark I was referring to was</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/50652">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/50652</a></p><p>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll have more questions, and I&apos;ll do my best to answer<br/>them!</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3>Stephen Szpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2004 6:20:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Stephen Szpak&quot; &lt;stephen_szpak@h...&gt;<br/>&gt;wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   (If anyone wants to comment to this that&apos;s fine.

What are &quot;vanishing commas&quot;? Does<br/>12 EDO<br/>&gt; &gt;have them<br/>&gt; &gt;    and why? Does 15 EDO have them and why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m glad you finally (and pretty quickly) understood Gene&apos;s comment<br/>&gt;on this. More could be said. See my reply to Mark, which I hope<br/>&gt;you&apos;ll read and try to follow. In that post I brought up<br/>the &apos;maximal<br/>&gt;diesis&apos;, which can be expressed as 250;243 -- it vanishes in 15-<br/>equal<br/>&gt;but not in 12-equal. This implies certain &apos;porcupine&apos; scale<br/>&gt;formations and chord progressions which work in 15-equal but not in<br/>&gt;12-equal -- Herman Miller has explored these in his music.<br/>Meanwhile,<br/>&gt;perhaps the most important comma of all, the &apos;syntonic comma&apos; or<br/>&gt;simply &apos;the comma&apos; or 81;80, vanishes in 12-equal but not in 15-<br/>&gt;equal; thus most conventional common-practice triadic diatonic music<br/>&gt;will work in 12-equal but not in 15-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Stephen,</p><p>When I wrote:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m glad you finally (and pretty quickly) understood Gene&apos;s comment<br/>&gt;on this.</p><p>I was referring to</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/50582">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/50582</a></p><p>But I guess I misinterpreted your reply there. It&apos;s true that 128:125<br/>is about 41 cents. When we speak of 128;125 vanishing, though, we are<br/>no longer speaking about Just Intonation. We are speaking of some<br/>temperament where all the consonant intervals are adjusted by some<br/>small amount. In Just Intonation, 128:125 is the difference between<br/>three major thirds and an octave (for example). So if we say 128;125<br/>vanishes in some temperament, we mean that the difference between<br/>three major thirds and an octave is zero in that temperament.</p><p>Similarly for 250:243. It&apos;s the difference between three minor thirds<br/>and two fourths (for example). In Just Intonation it happens to be 49<br/>cents. In 12-equal it&apos;s 100 cents. But in 15-equal and some other<br/>temperaments (called &quot;porcupine&quot; temperaments), it&apos;s zero, it<br/>vanishes. This fact leads to new scales and chord progressions that<br/>are, some say, as &quot;natural&quot; in 15-equal (and other porcupine<br/>temperaments) as the diatonic scale and its typical chord<br/>progressions are in 12-equal (and other meantone temperaments).</p><p>The reply to Mark I was referring to was</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/50652">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/50652</a></p><p>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll have more questions, and I&apos;ll do my best to answer<br/>them!</p><p>-Paul<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p><p>STEPHEN SZPAK WRITES:::::::::::::::::::</p><p>    Thanks Paul (Erlich) for your help.
