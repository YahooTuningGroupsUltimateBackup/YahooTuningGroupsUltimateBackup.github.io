Actually, it has<br/>&gt; nothing<br/>&gt;&gt; to do with the high third we&apos;re talking about here. Here&apos;s the set up:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Play a low C and ask the basses to match it. Then ask the women to tune<br/>&gt;&gt; a tenth above it. Once tuned, compare it to the piano&apos;s E and notice that<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt;&gt; is as one would think--slightly below. No surprise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Then play a low C and ask the basses to match it and ask the tenors to<br/>&gt;&gt; tune a perfect fifth above it. When the perfect fifth is in evidence,<br/>&gt; again<br/>&gt;&gt; ask the women to tune a tenth above the bass. Note that their &quot;third&quot; will<br/>&gt;&gt; be higher than the piano&apos;s third. *Big* surprise!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It works *every* time. I&apos;ve demonstrated it with my choirs, other people&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; choirs, and on the road with choral festival choirs I&apos;ve never met.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; No 7ths, 9ths and 13ths. No 6-9 chords. Just a simple major triad. Just<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt;&gt; in Renaissance endings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is extremely interesting and altogether disturbing!! I had not the<br/>&gt; chance to propose this experiment to our choir master yet but I can&apos;t wait<br/>&gt; to do so!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no explanation but only a few cues from my observation of a cappella<br/>&gt; ensemble sonogram. It seems that when a chord take place, the outer voices<br/>&gt; (i.e. soprano and bass) settle first while inner voices &quot;fiddle around&quot;<br/>&gt; their notes. Then after a very short while (order of tenths of second) inner<br/>&gt; voices find their place in the chord. I cannot claim to have a statistically<br/>&gt; representative sample but that seems to match subjective experience of<br/>&gt; chorus singing. Then intonation of various inversion of the same chord may<br/>&gt; be different, and furthermore, the order of entry of the voices may be quite<br/>&gt; significant as proved by Gerald experiment.</p><p>What is interesting, Fran&ccedil;ois, when the sopranos enter second (before<br/>tenors) and carefully tune the &quot;low&quot; 4:5 third, their third &quot;floats&quot; upward<br/>when the tenors introduce the fifth. Whether this is a &quot;real&quot; change of<br/>pitch by the sopranos or simply an illusion is still a question in my mind.</p><p>However, the last time I did this with my college &quot;beginner&quot; choir, I stood<br/>right in front of the sopranos and heard some individual &quot;reshuffling&quot; of<br/>pitches. Then it settled into the &quot;high&quot; third. That would seem to suggest<br/>that they actually changed their pitch when the tenors entered. I&apos;ll have to<br/>do that again and see if it happens consistently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have another remark, If we look at the placement of the partial in the<br/>&gt; chord, with emphasis on the common partial (assuming JI) for soprano-bass<br/>&gt; and soprano-tenor pair<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; soprano...........1..........2.........3.........4<br/>&gt; tenor..........1.....2.....3.....4.....5.....6....<br/>&gt; bass.........1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...0<br/>&gt; S/Bcommon....................X...................X<br/>&gt; S/Tcommon..............................X..........<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the first case (B,S then T entry ) sopranos can rely on the beat of their<br/>&gt; F2 with bass F5.<br/>&gt; In the second case (B,T, then S) depending of the physical disposal of the<br/>&gt; choir, the bass F5 may be more or less masked by tenor F3 which is normally<br/>&gt; much louder. Then instead of relying solely on bass F5, soprano may now rely<br/>&gt; also on the beat of their F3 with tenor&apos;s F5. Unfortunately, as I stated I a<br/>&gt; previous message, human voice is not produce by a string stretched on a<br/>&gt; wooden box and higher harmonics are not as sharp (in term of narrowness of<br/>&gt; spectral peak) as lowers ones, thus using soprano&apos;s F3 instead of F2 for<br/>&gt; beating cues for justness may be less reliable. If it is the case, sopranos<br/>&gt; may then rely on more subtle cues than beat adjustment (as well as on their<br/>&gt; musical subjective experience), subtle cues that may more subject to<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic affect such as octave stretching (but I do not know how).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anybody has ideas on the subject?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p><p>As I remember from last year&apos;s discussion of this topic, some of the list<br/>members worked on this idea. Perhaps someone remembers where it led and can<br/>point Francois to appropriate archieves.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>PS: Let us know what your choral person finds regarding the &quot;experiment.&quot;</p><p>(Bob, I think the description of the &quot;experiment&quot; quoted above may be worded<br/>differently from the one I quoted [copied] for you yesterday.
