If you downloaded the MP3 before Saturday, 3rd April then the lead and chords are a bit out of sync after the first minute or so. I have since remixed the tune and fixed this. With the old version the lead comes in immediately but with the new version the lead comes in on the second &quot;verse&quot;. If you are interested you can download the new version from my web site: <a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">www.johnsmusic7.com</a> . Alternatively you can play a shorter version by clicking the &quot;Files&quot; link to the left of your screen and scroll down to near the bottom of the list.</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I think that my &quot;Major&quot;, &quot;Blue Minor&quot; and &quot;Ultra Minor&quot; chords are &quot;pure&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt;     Perhaps a more obvious proof of this would be to list a handful (maybe 20 or so) chords that are impossible to play in 12TET (or at least, sound grossly impure in 12TET but at least decent in your scale).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Pardon my skepticism, but I&apos;m guessing your scale have more &quot;possible to play in 12TET, but grossly impure&quot; scales and the former goal is more suitable for scales with odd intervals such as deca-tonic scales in 22TET and things like Ozan&apos;s Maqam-like tunings.
