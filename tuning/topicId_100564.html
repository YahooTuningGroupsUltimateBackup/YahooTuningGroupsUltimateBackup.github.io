Musically speaking, 17/8 is an interval, specifically, a minor ninth. It could also be described as a reference to overtone #17. (Although in technical terms, overtone #17 is 17/1.) For example, given a pitch of 100 Hz, the 17/8 interval points to the next pitch of 100*17/8=212.5 Hz.</p><p>The easiest way to identify overtones in this ratio system is that overtones all have denominators which are powers of 2. You&apos;ll also often see these ratios expressed with assumed octave equivalence when people talk about scales, meaning that the denominator is multipled or divided by 2 until the ratio itself is at least 1 and less than 2. Thus, 17/8 and 17/16 (the minor second) usually refer to the same pitch in a scale. The exception to this is when a scale covers more or less than an octave.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;collinet&quot; &lt;jbcollinet@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello everyone!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reading your posts everyday makes me both feel happy and dizzy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All those primes (it&apos;s OK with Mersenne, though) and ratios are making my head spin...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could someone get me back in theory and explain me again what 17/8 means?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been away from this kind of things for too long.
