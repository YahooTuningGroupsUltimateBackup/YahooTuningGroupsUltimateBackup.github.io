If someone knows of where I could find simple explanations of, for instance, what &quot;abelian group&quot; means it would surely help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t get how this works if you extend to other primes, though.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s based on the fact that in 12edo, the 2 takes 12 steps, the 3 19 steps, and the 5 28 steps. So, if you wanted to find what 12 uses for a 7, you could try 12*log2(7) = 33.688, which rounds to 34. This, in fact, is the correct answer, so the 12et septimal val is&lt;12 19 28 34|. If you look at 11, 12*log2(11) = 41.513, which is just about half way between 41 and 42, so it&apos;s not so clear which one to pick. However, if you look at 5 and 7, they are rounded up (are sharp), so you would round up to 42. This gives the correct unidecimal val for 12, which happens to be the &quot;patent val&quot;, the one obtained by rounding to the nearest integer:&lt;12 19 28 34 42|.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Here&apos;s the septimal m3 I love so much:<br/>&gt;&gt; 7/6 = 2^-1 3^-1 5^0 7^1, or |-1 -1 0 1&gt;. It should land on Eb, the 3rd<br/>&gt;&gt; step of 12TET.<br/>&gt; Except you need to use the septimal val, so it&apos;s&lt;12 19 28 34|-1 -1 0 1&gt;  = -12-19+0+34 = 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It seems like I need to understand the val better. How are 2^12, 3^19,<br/>&gt;&gt; and 5^28 related to a generator for 12TET?<br/>&gt; They aren&apos;t; vals are not monzos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; M3 monzo: 5/4 = |-2 0 1&gt;.<br/>&gt;&gt; Product:&lt;0 1 4| -2 0 1&gt;  = 0*-2 + 1*0 + 4*1 = 4 steps to the M3. Good!<br/>&gt;&gt; But is it just coincidence?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Octave monzo: 2/1 = |1 0 0&gt;.<br/>&gt;&gt; Product of octave monzo and the meantone val:&lt;0 1 4|1 0 0&gt;  = 0*1 +<br/>&gt;&gt; 1*0 + 4*0 = 0. Bad.<br/>&gt; Nope, good. If C is 0, then C&apos; had better be 0 also, because you don&apos;t go up or down the chain of fifths to reach it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; m3 monzo: 6/5 = |1 1 -1&gt;.<br/>&gt;&gt; Product:&lt;0 1 4| 1 1 -1&gt;  = 0*1 + 1*1 + 4*-1 = -3.

It&apos;s easy to see that a finite state automaton can reproduce any behavior, which suggests it may be impossible in principle to determine consciousness from behavior.</p><p>Scientists as amateur philosophers are no better than any other educated person from what I have seen, and are quite likely to think they are better at it than they are.</p></div><h3><a id=96788 href="#96788">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2011 1:09:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll repeat my suggestion: write the articles you think are needed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, Aaron, simply write the content you are trying to learn.<br/>&gt; Duh!</p><p>Aaron is perfectly capable of adding content.

I guess that why I get annoyed by the culture of needless abstraction in much mathematics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope you know, then, that I have a lot of Python code here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/regular.zip">http://x31eq.com/temper/regular.zip</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It covers a fair bit.  It uses vals a lot but I don&apos;t use the term<br/>&gt; &quot;val&quot; anywhere that I can remember.  It doesn&apos;t do hobbits.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; because  I&apos;m genuinely unable to generate hobbits in Python.  I think<br/>&gt; it&apos;s difficult.  Maybe one day you or I or somebody else will write<br/>&gt; the code and then we can look at it to decide how difficult the<br/>&gt; problem really is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may be able to adapt the code for finding mappings to give<br/>&gt; hobbits.  I think they&apos;re analogous problems.  Unfortunately, that<br/>&gt; code isn&apos;t at all simple :-(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve got somewhere with Pari/GP.  The code for that is here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/parametric.gp">http://x31eq.com/parametric.gp</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Naturally, anything that can be done with Pari can also be done with<br/>&gt; Sage, where Python is the scripting language.  I don&apos;t have Sage<br/>&gt; installed here and now so I haven&apos;t done that.  I don&apos;t think it would<br/>&gt; make much difference.  GP isn&apos;t as nice as Python but there isn&apos;t much<br/>&gt; syntax involved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The (semi)norm that hobbits minimize is temperamental complexity.  The<br/>&gt; functions are there in GP to calculate it.  By trial and error you can<br/>&gt; find the intervals of minimal complexity for a given number of scale<br/>&gt; steps.  I don&apos;t have a cleaner way of finding the hobbit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The octave equivalent function isn&apos;t there.  That&apos;s because I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; happy with it.  You can find my comments on tuning-math.  Or, use<br/>&gt; Gene&apos;s alternative method for getting hobbit pitches within the octave<br/>&gt; from an octave-specific function.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene has said that finding each pitch of the hobbit maps to finding<br/>&gt; the shortest vector in a lattice.  I haven&apos;t been able to work that<br/>&gt; out.  Maybe it isn&apos;t that difficult, but it is at least more<br/>&gt; appropriate for tuning-math.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that the &quot;meantone scale&quot; in my GP code is solving a hobbit-like<br/>&gt; problem.  Maybe that could be adapted to produce hobbits with<br/>&gt; octave-equivalent vectors.  Have a look at it if you like.  Note, at<br/>&gt; least, that Pari is capable of finding shortest vectors in certain<br/>&gt; lattices.

I could also do it, of<br/>course, and maybe I will if you have difficulty.</p><p>In GP, * is a matrix product, ~ is a transpose, matdet is a<br/>determinant, and matadjoint(X)/matdet(X) is an inverse.<br/>Other things are explained in the tutorial -- it&apos;s all free<br/>software.</p><p>The things you can&apos;t easily duplicate from that file are<br/>the lattice minimizations and the clever function to<br/>convert between mappings (vals) and unison vectors<br/>(commas).  You don&apos;t need them to understand hobbits.</p><p>Warning: I calculate temperamental complexity using a norm<br/>on intervals in a temperament.  Gene prefers a seminorm on<br/>monzos (JI-like vectors).  He may document both.  (I&apos;m not<br/>sure, I didn&apos;t do my research for this post, how naughty.)<br/>I think you can get the octave-equivalent version from<br/>either by throwing away the 2 dimension.  Given that, I<br/>think Gene&apos;s instructions are understandable.</p><p>To find the hobbit, what you have to do is try every<br/>possible interval that gives the right number of scale<br/>steps.  As such, that&apos;s impossible, but Gene says rounding<br/>each element of the vector up and down similar to Fokker<br/>blocks (coded in Python) is good enough.  That&apos;s an<br/>exponential time algorithm, but still, don&apos;t be frightened<br/>of it.</p><p>&gt; I wonder if it wouldn&apos;t be nice to add a &apos;code&apos; section<br/>&gt; to the wiki so that people might be able to grok<br/>&gt; tuning-math concepts in the language of their choice?<br/>&gt; Maybe that&apos;s a far off goal, but I know many of us,<br/>&gt; myself included, already have scripts for doing<br/>&gt; tuning-math. I have a whole library of stuff, and I&apos;d say<br/>&gt; it&apos;s safe to say that the tuning-math I really get is the<br/>&gt; stuff I&apos;ve coded scripts for.

If you were teaching traditional music theory, and someone said, &quot;But how do I make a M7b5 chord easy to understand?&quot; I&apos;d suggest that you don&apos;t worry about how to teach that chord. Focus on triads, 7th chords, tritones, and leading tones first, because that&apos;s what most students need first; M7b5 chords are for the advanced musician, so almost by definition you don&apos;t need a beginner&apos;s explanation for them.</p><p>By the way: because I now know that hobbits are an advanced topic, I can ignore them for a while. As I was first trying to make sense of the xenharmonic wiki, I didn&apos;t know they were an advanced topic, and I struggled to understand them. (I still don&apos;t understand them, but I no longer struggle because I know enough to know that I don&apos;t need to know them yet.) George Secor said about 11-EDO that there&apos;s low contrast between the high- and low-dissonance intervals; analogously, the xenharmonic wiki is currently written in 11-EDO, where there&apos;s low contrast between high- and low-complexity topics. There&apos;s nothing wrong with 11-EDO, but it&apos;s a rare tune that will be written that way that reaches a general audience. I don&apos;t think the wiki should be written in 12-EDO, but it should probably be written in something more like 19. :)</p><p>So, if you&apos;re trying to figure out how to make things easier for non-mathematicians, don&apos;t start with something that complex. Start instead by coming up with simple examples of the basic things that you do, e.g., commas, vals, monzos, tempering. Use them in several examples that would be immediately useful to the beginner, e.g., translating this:</p><p>----<br/>Subgroup: 2.5/3.7/3.11/3<br/>Commas: 121/120, 126/125</p><p>POTE generator: ~11/10 = 156.055</p><p>Map: [&lt;1 1 2 2|, &lt;0 -2 -6 -1|]<br/>EDOs: 8, 15, 23, 77, 100<br/>----</p><p>...into a scale or set of scales that someone can play with. (That&apos;s the &quot;Greeley&quot; Chromatic Pair on the new Chromatic Pairs page, by the way.) Give a sense of why you&apos;d want to temper those commas; help people understand how those EDOs support Greeley, and why more than one does so; explain what a generator is (or what the different types of generators are).</p><p>Even if the way you use these things is mechanical -- say I don&apos;t understand what a subgroup is yet, but I can use the generator and the vals given to generate the scale -- that&apos;s better than making sure I understand what a subgroup is. Because if a musician gets a scale he can play, he can start to make music, which will make all the other stuff worth digging into. Until he gets to that point, Greeley is just a blob of numbers.</p><p>Maybe that&apos;s not possible. But if it is, that&apos;s the approach I&apos;d take.</p><p>I&apos;m very grateful to those who have stocked the wiki with so much information, and to people like Gene and Igs who have provided information on this list. Getting good information, even if opaque to the average musician, is a very important start. I&apos;m willing to help simplify and write (where I think I understand something) to give something back to the community.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=96824 href="#96824">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2011 7:39:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I said none of those things.

You also need to choose carefully which examples to<br/>give, which isn&apos;t a simple matter, but let&apos;s do it.  The<br/>example I&apos;ve given before is 5-limit meantone.  Here&apos;s the<br/>mapping:</p><p>[&lt;31, 49, 72], &lt; 12, 19, 28]&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s the reduced basis:</p><p>[&lt;1, 1, 0], &lt;0, 1, 4]&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s the matrix that determines temperamental TE<br/>complexity in terms of the reduced basis.</p><p>( 0.247 -0.029)<br/>(-0.029  0.102)</p><p>Note: because one of the generators is the period, I<br/>believe the octave-equivalent metric amounts to the number<br/>0.102.  That is, you remove the first column and first row<br/>from the metric and only consider the octave-equivalent<br/>generator.  That means the OETEC becomes</p><p>sqrt(n*0.102*n) = abs(n)*sqrt(0.102)</p><p>for n generator steps.  This is obviously counting<br/>generator steps and shows why rank 2 hobbits are also MOS.</p><p>Note also that my normalization is probably different to<br/>Gene&apos;s, and so the number 0.102 really has no meaning.</p><p>Anyway, here are the examples of the octave-specific<br/>complexity with the above metric:</p><p>2:1 0.497<br/>3:2 0.320<br/>4:3 0.638<br/>5:4 1.759<br/>9:8 0.879<br/>6:5 0.960</p><p>I think you need at least this number of intervals to show<br/>the pattern.

I&apos;ve thought of some<br/>counterexamples.  Any rank 2 case where you don&apos;t get a 9:8<br/>in the MOS will break.  3:2 and 4:3 are the simplest<br/>intervals within the octave.  Except for a really<br/>pathological case where 9:8 is tempered out, one degree<br/>will have 3/2 as its simplest ratio and another will have<br/>4/3.  The interval between them will be 9:8.  When you<br/>temper it, you&apos;ll find the tempered version of 9:8 in<br/>there, and if that shouldn&apos;t be in the MOS what you have<br/>can&apos;t be an MOS.  A hobbit should be.  Examples are 10<br/>notes of Miracle, 9 notes of Orwell, and 7 notes of Magic.</p><p>Also, think about the decimal scale of Miracle.  6 steps<br/>will be best approximated by 3/2.  That means you must have<br/>6 secors counting from the tonic.  Three secors should give<br/>the approximation to 11/9.  But 5/4 will come out as<br/>simpler for this degree.  The 4:5:6 chord is too complex to<br/>fit in the decimal scale, but with your algorithm it&apos;s<br/>irresistible.</p><p>&gt; Since the OE seminorm isn&apos;t actually defined in the<br/>&gt; hobbit algorithm, but is rather left open such that one<br/>&gt; can use any seminorm that one wants, then my algorithm<br/>&gt; would be a hobbit with the OE seminorm defined as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OE(i) = min(geomean(S_i))</p><p>That&apos;s an interesting interpretation of the algorithm.  The<br/>seminorm is, at least, constrained.  It should give unison<br/>vectors zero size.  If it&apos;s octave equivalent, it should<br/>give octaves zero size.  For rank 2 that leaves you with no<br/>degrees of freedom.</p><p>&gt; Where S_i is the set of all intervals that are tempered<br/>&gt; to be equivalent to it, geomean yields a new set with the<br/>&gt; geometric mean of the old site, and min takes the lowest<br/>&gt; value.

The norm it transforms to is RxR<br/>for rank R temperaments.  Any imposition of octave<br/>equivalence has to reduce the rank by 1.

But you<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t dealt with the underlying complexity and you<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t explained octave-equivalent Tenney-Euclidean<br/>&gt; complexity (OETEC) which I think is difficult to explain.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean to devalue difficult concepts (though it&apos;s<br/>true I&apos;m not a fan of the word &quot;difficult&quot;).  I meant to<br/>improve the high-level explanation.  I do think it&apos;s a big<br/>mistake to not put effort into high-level explanations, or<br/>tell people they have no need of them, or that no high-level<br/>explanation is possible.  I&apos;d try to improve the details<br/>too, but I&apos;ll need to understand them myself first.</p><p>&gt; So I meant to back Gene up on that.  While all kinds of<br/>&gt; things can be improved there are still concepts like vals<br/>&gt; and norms that you need to bring in under one name or<br/>&gt; another.</p><p>I&apos;m not against terminology or equations, as I do not<br/>think they are sources of difficulty.  In fact I despise<br/>pop physics books that deal in meaningless analogies in an<br/>effort to avoid math.  I&apos;m against bad explanations.  Not<br/>nearly enough effort is spent in our society on good<br/>explanations.  Take Paul&apos;s gentle intro to Fokker blocks,<br/>which I used back in the thread on rank 3 scales.  It was<br/>absolutely effortless to follow and implement.  At least it<br/>didn&apos;t feel like effort.</p><p>I hate to keep bringing up Feynman, but this story by<br/>Thinking Machines founder Danny Hills is really great if<br/>you haven&apos;t read it<br/><a href="http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/">http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/</a><br/>Note what he says about the dumbed-down article Hills wrote<br/>for Scientific American.<br/>Then there&apos;s this Dyson quote:<br/>&quot;Dick was also a profoundly original scientist. He refused<br/>to take anybody&apos;s word for anything. This meant that he was<br/>forced to rediscover or reinvent for himself almost the whole<br/>of physics. It took him five years of concentrated work to<br/>reinvent quantum mechanics. **He said that he couldn&apos;t<br/>understand the official version of quantum mechanics that was<br/>taught in textbooks,** and so he had to begin afresh from the<br/>beginning.  That was a heroic enterprise. He worked harder<br/>during those years than anybody else I ever knew. At the end<br/>he had a version of quantum mechanics that he could understand.<br/>The calculation that I did for Hans Bethe, using the orthodox<br/>theory, took me several months of work and several hundred<br/>sheets of paper. Dick could get the same answer, calculating<br/>on a blackboard, in half an hour.&quot;  [emphasis added]</p><p>If something like &quot;learning styles&quot; exist, I bet I&apos;m in the<br/>same bucket as Feynman (only at the bottom).  And I bet there<br/>are a lot of others too, who get washed out of the system<br/>before they&apos;re even counted.  Probably some go on to become<br/>musicians, only to encounter the xenwiki. ;)</p><p>And it&apos;s not just an issue for students.  Browsing <a href="http://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>,<br/>I often muse that better theories must be lurking in there,<br/>just not assembled in one place.</p><p>&gt; I vote for you committing your changes to the wiki (if you<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t already -- I haven&apos;t checked) and I&apos;ll take it from<br/>&gt; there.</p><p>Great, I&apos;ll do so (probably tomorrow).</p><p>&gt; On the point of examples, I do think you need more than<br/>&gt; three.  You also need to choose carefully which examples to<br/>&gt; give, which isn&apos;t a simple matter, but let&apos;s do it.  The<br/>&gt; example I&apos;ve given before is 5-limit meantone.  Here&apos;s the<br/>&gt; mapping:<br/>&gt; [&lt;31, 49, 72], &lt; 12, 19, 28]&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the reduced basis:<br/>&gt; [&lt;1, 1, 0], &lt;0, 1, 4]&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the matrix that determines temperamental TE<br/>&gt; complexity in terms of the reduced basis.<br/>&gt; ( 0.247 -0.029)<br/>&gt; (-0.029  0.102)</p><p>Looks good, though I don&apos;t have time to check it now.  I&apos;ll<br/>let you do that once I commit my thing to the wiki.</p><p>One thing to note is that I stopped to give examples of the<br/>seminorm just to illustrate the two properties mentioned,<br/>without showing other details.  First I illustrate octave<br/>ignorance with 3/2 and 3/1 (IIRC) and then the complexity<br/>with 25/16.  So I agree that choosing the right examples is<br/>critical.  If you&apos;ve ever worked at a shop that practices<br/>rigorous TDD then I suggest you think of it that way.<br/>My wife once practiced her spiel on me as I implemented a<br/>spell checker in Python.  She had me write absolutely trivial<br/>tests - and make them fail - before letting me write a line<br/>of code.  Her job is to make big-ego programmers do this on<br/>a daily basis.  The fact that she makes twice what they do<br/>suggests it works.  There&apos;s nothing against fully worked<br/>examples at the bottom, but they don&apos;t replace the kind of<br/>inline, incremental examples I&apos;m advocating here.</p><p>&gt; Note: because one of the generators is the period, I<br/>&gt; believe the octave-equivalent metric amounts to the number<br/>&gt; 0.102.  That is, you remove the first column and first row<br/>&gt; from the metric and only consider the octave-equivalent<br/>&gt; generator.<br/>&gt; That means the OETEC becomes<br/>&gt; sqrt(n*0.102*n) = abs(n)*sqrt(0.102)<br/>&gt; for n generator steps.  This is obviously counting<br/>&gt; generator steps and shows why rank 2 hobbits are also MOS.</p><p>I got this far in my mind when you said it last time, but<br/>I was unable to convince myself that it always leads to MOS.<br/>If I worked it on paper I probably could close the gap...</p><p>&gt; Note also that my normalization is probably different to<br/>&gt; Gene&apos;s, and so the number 0.102 really has no meaning.</p><p>Just a constant, sure.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, here are the examples of the octave-specific<br/>&gt; complexity with the above metric:<br/>&gt; 2:1 0.497<br/>&gt; 3:2 0.320<br/>&gt; 4:3 0.638<br/>&gt; 5:4 1.759<br/>&gt; 9:8 0.879<br/>&gt; 6:5 0.960<br/>&gt; I think you need at least this number of intervals to show<br/>&gt; the pattern.</p><p>I still don&apos;t see why 2:1 is 0.497.  And you should probably<br/>show something like 3:1 again too.</p><p>&gt; Would 7-limit Marvel (225/224-planar) be a good example<br/>&gt; for OETEC?</p><p>Usually for any of this stuff I like to see at least 3<br/>examples: rank 1 codimension 2, rank 2 codimension 1, and<br/>rank 2 codimension 2.  Marvel is rank 3 codimension 1 but<br/>it can&apos;t hurt.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
