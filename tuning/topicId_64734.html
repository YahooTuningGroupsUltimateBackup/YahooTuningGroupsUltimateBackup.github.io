Maybe I should try again.</p><p>As the name suggests, one of the nifty featues of 41 is that it is a<br/>good tuning for magic temperament. Another, as you note, is that it<br/>gives us the 9-limit diamond, and is an excellent 9-limit system overall.</p></div><h3><a id=64741 href="#64741">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

Anyone<br/>&gt; have any listening suggestions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan</p><p>If you want see and hear a very short (7-measure) example piece (13-<br/>limit) that will allow you to compare it to some other tunings, go to:<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/exmp/index.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/exmp/index.htm</a></p><p>Another interesting thing about 41-ET is that it&apos;s a subset of 2460-ET<br/>(27-limit consistent, and also a multiple of 12).  2460 is the division<br/>in which we&apos;re able to map most of the smallest intervals that can be<br/>notated in the Sagittal notation.  For example, we can distinguish<br/>between 26:27 (difference between a Pythagorean A and 13/8 of C),<br/>8192:8505 (difference between the apotome and the sum of 80:81 and<br/>63:64), and 51200:531441 (three 80:81 commas) -- steps of &lt; 1/2 cent.<br/>If you were to build flexible-pitch acoustic instruments in 41-ET, you<br/>could approximate any of the 27-limit consonances to better than 1/6<br/>cent (and most of them considerably better than that) by pitch-bending<br/>in increments of 1/60 degree (you might call them &quot;minutes&quot;, but we<br/>already call them &quot;minas&quot;, which is short for &quot;schisminas&quot;).  I think<br/>it&apos;s an excellent reference framework for defining pitches for<br/>electronic music.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=64743 href="#64743">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2006 2:18:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

The nice<br/>thing about 41 into 2460 is that 60 parts is reasonably easy, so the<br/>combination of 41-ET instruments and a Reinhard-style notation (in<br/>2460th-octave increments) would be a good match.</p><p>--George</p></div>
