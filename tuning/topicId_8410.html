That seems slightly peculiar for the time,<br/>no??  Also the transitional 5-limit consonances before hopping back to the<br/>beloved &quot;trine...&quot;  Curiously enough, Gustave Reese only has one teeny-tiny<br/>citation of Solage in BOTH his books on Medieval and Rennaissance music,<br/>which are the only things handy here...  looks like Willi Apel has much<br/>more from the footnote... It&apos;s good that Solage is not quite as obscure as<br/>&quot;anonymous&quot; who&apos;s written far too many pieces as it is, in my opinion...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
