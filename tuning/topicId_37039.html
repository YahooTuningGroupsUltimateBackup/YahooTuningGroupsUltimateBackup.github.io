In this<br/>case the first parameter can be read as the number of fifths in the<br/>longest chains and the second parameter as the number of chains of<br/>fifths.</p><p>Just what is the optimum way to choose these two parameters? This is<br/>something that needs to be explored.</p><p>We know how to calculate the cardinalities of the most even scales in<br/>_linear_ temperaments while standing on our heads, but I haven&apos;t a<br/>clue how we do that for planar temperaments except by trial and error.<br/>This relates to an earlier discussion on &quot;Trihills property&quot;.</p><p>Similarly for the number of harmonies. This is easy for linear, but<br/>other than counting them, I don&apos;t have a handle on this for the<br/>various subsets of planar temperaments, except it seems they should be<br/>as close to &quot;circular&quot; as possible. But how to scale the axes?</p><p>Another data point for this investigation is the 19-tone Byzantine<br/>tetrachord superset scale that I derived from Rami Vitale&apos;s 23 note<br/>rational one. It might be called QM(4,3). The middle chain has 3 notes<br/>while the other 4 chains have 4.</p><p>I suspect QM(1,2) and QM(1,3) will be harmonically and melodically<br/>good 6 and 8 note scales/chords.

But they are all very well represented in 72-ET,<br/>&gt; &gt; where they do meet up. I still refer to the QMs as being in the<br/>&gt; planar<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament when they are in 72-ET, because their boundaries are<br/>&gt; best<br/>&gt; &gt; understood as two dimensional; as bounds on the number of fifths<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; the number of secors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t these scales perfect examples of &apos;hyper-MOS&apos; scales (as<br/>&gt; defined in the discussion of the Hypothesis) -- periodicity blocks<br/>&gt; (possibly of the Fokker variety) where more than one unison vector<br/>&gt; remains un-tempered-out?</p><p>Almost certainly.</p><p>&gt; also, didn&apos;t gene post a considerable bunch<br/>&gt; of such scales a while back -- under rubrics such as &quot;meantone-<br/>&gt; miracle&quot;?</p><p>Quite possibly.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What I&apos;d like to know is how the melodic evenness and number of<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonies relates to the size and shape of the 2D boundary, in the<br/>&gt; way<br/>&gt; &gt; that we know how it works for linear temperaments with their 1D<br/>&gt; &gt; boundary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s time to delve into this hyper-mos stuff in earnest. thanks,<br/>&gt; carl, for inspiring this terminology (though i recall mats oljare<br/>&gt; proposing something equivalent, 2nd-order MOS or some such) . . .</p><p>Hoorah. I get the feeling we should move it to tuning-math.</p><p>I wonder how big a rectangle Partch&apos;s Genesis scale needs on the<br/>fifths*secors grid? 9*5?
