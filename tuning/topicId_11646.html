Show how<br/>you &quot;determined&quot; that traveling up the harmonic series<br/>is too far out for de common folk by using harmonics like<br/>11, 13, 29, 31, 61, or 63. Compare them to 12 tone evil<br/>temperament and the purrdy 5 limit JI.</p><p>Whadda ya think?</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@teleport.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2000 7:18:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Keenan Pepper [<a href="mailto:mtpepper@prodigy.net">mailto:mtpepper@prodigy.net</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, August 20, 2000 3:18 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] re: Tuning-related Science Fair Question<br/>?

So we look for the science behind<br/>the art, and that would be, again IMHO, psychoacoustics. A good place to<br/>start reading would be William Sethares&apos; &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot;<br/>for the underlying mathematics of consonance and dissonance. You will find<br/>that the conventional wisdom about &quot;complexity of ratios&quot; and &quot;subjective<br/>in-tune-ness&quot; applies only to instruments which generate tones with harmonic<br/>partials. Just intonation is the set of intervals which sound good when<br/>played on these instruments.</p><p>&gt; and make some poor souls listen to my synth blat and<br/>&gt; interrogate them on which of two noises that sound exactly the<br/>&gt; same to them<br/>&gt; sounds better.<br/>&gt; But I&apos;m being cynical.</p><p>No, you&apos;re learning what it means to be a psychoacoustician :-). Helmholtz<br/>did exactly that, except he used vibrating strings, tuning forks, organ<br/>pipes, reeds and other physical means of producing sound ... and look what<br/>he found! A more modern experiment might be to get your hands on a polygraph<br/>(check your local police station :-), hook it up to a listener and play<br/>music in various xentonal &quot;harmonies&quot; like Sethares has written, and compare<br/>the traces with those produced when the subject hears more conventional<br/>music.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Are they using the wrong intervals? Not necessarily. Sethares<br/>fails to consider other psychoacoustic phenomena which favor JI chords even<br/>with inharmonic timbres (e.g., combination tones and harmonic entropy), and<br/>ones which favor harmonic timbres even with non-JI chords (e.g., the<br/>perception of harmonic series as single &quot;timbres&quot; while partial structure<br/>that deviate greatly from harmonicity are heard instead as &quot;chords&quot;).<br/>However, Sethares&apos; work is not invalid, particularly in cases of electronic<br/>timbres where the deviations from harmonicity are slight but large enough to<br/>audibly change the intervals of minimum roughness . . .</p></div>
