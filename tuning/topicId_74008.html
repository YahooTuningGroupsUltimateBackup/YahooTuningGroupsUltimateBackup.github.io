I am teaching<br/>someone counterpoint and I cannot find my own  manuscript under my pile of<br/>papers.&quot;  In 1817 (probably March) Beethoven  asked Tobias haslinger, his friend,<br/>publisher and music dealer in Vienna, for  one of the standard works of music<br/>theory.  The &quot;someone&quot;, whom Beethoven  does not wish to mention, is without a<br/>doubt the Archduke Rudolph.  He was  the only person to whom Beethoven taught<br/>counterpoint, music theory and  composition.  uiton had already begun in<br/>1809.  For this purpose  Beethoven compiled extra cts from the most important<br/>contemporary music books,  mainly no couterpoint and the theory of the fugue.<br/>[Deethoven-Haus Bonn  Digital archives]  Sammlung H.C. Bodmer, HCB Mh 46i</p><p>There is much more, with Beethoven copying many  (I believe there were 9<br/>pages of different Kirnberger-Beethoven related  documents.</p><p>Paul:  Kinrnberger&apos;s KRS is a big work  covering lots of stuff. I don&apos;t doubt<br/>Beethoven could have used some aspects  of it. It&apos;s the temperament<br/>that I think is amateurish and of little or no  practical value for<br/>music of &gt;1780. Most especially Beethoven. And  whenever I mention<br/>Kirnberger and temperament in the same breath, I mean his  original<br/>temperament, the one with 1/2 comma fifths.</p><p>Johnny:  You  are somewhat unfair.  You lambaste the fellow, and then begin<br/>hedging.  Having present Beethoven in live performance in Kirnberger (II  and<br/>III), I think you are full of ... nonsense.  You really just don&apos;t  know.<br/>Kirnberger III is only a bow towards just, and this serves  Beethoven&apos;s piano<br/>music well.  As an example, listen to the Moonlight  Sonata in the radio archive<br/>of the AFMM web site _www.afmm.org_ (<a href="http://www.afmm.org">http://www.afmm.org</a>)<br/>played by Joshua Pierce.  You have to be  tone deaf not to listen to that<br/>performance and then to say the tuning is  &quot;amateurish and of little or no<br/>practical value.&quot;</p><p>&gt; JR: Yes, it is true, you do not get any  of this. :)<br/>&gt; There are a number of reasons why there was a difference  between<br/>church<br/>&gt; organs and keyboards tuned for wind instruments like  oboes and<br/>bassoons.<br/>&gt; Firstly, woods sound better when they can be  elongated a bit (note<br/>the early music<br/>&gt; fixation on 415  herz).</p><p>Paul:  Woodwinds were built at many different pitches at many  different<br/>times. They sound different, I hesitate to say &quot;better&quot;.</p><p>Johnny:  That&apos;s because you are not a  woodwind player.  Even a half step<br/>flatter, and I&apos;m sure Mr. Haynes would  agree, makes for a warmer sound in the<br/>instrument.  In this regard,  Frederick the Great had been pushing for the<br/>lowest pitches so he would sound  best.  Warmer is better.</p><p>Paul:  Depends on<br/>what you are after; a  mellow, warm sound, or a bright piquant sound.<br/>It just so happens that  bassons and clarinets were largely of French<br/>origins, and French pitch was  low</p><p>Johnny:  Actually, there is a different  between the German &quot;fagot&quot; and the<br/>French &quot;basson&quot; in that they are completely  different instruments to play with<br/>the German instrument played dark due to a  heavy spine running down the<br/>reed, and the French emphasizing the higher  register with a reedier or &quot;buzzier&quot;<br/>sound (an little if any spine).  I&apos;m  sure the oboes that were longer sounded<br/>better than otherwise and were  associated with lower kammer pitch.</p><p>. Early Dulcians and cornetti, on the<br/>other  hand, were high.</p><p>&gt; Secondly, organ parts are cheaper when the pipes  are smaller.</p><p>This idea was floating around the Netherlands 15 years ago  or so, but<br/>I don&apos;t know anybody who believes it.</p><p>Johnny:  The people who wrote about it, like  Werckmeister, believed it.</p><p>&gt; Thirdly,<br/>&gt; higher pitch is  symbolically closer to God, angel like, for an<br/>instrument<br/>&gt; designed to  get God&apos;s attention.</p><p>Paul:  That&apos;s very creative, but it doesn&apos;t  wash. Organs were originally<br/>pitched lower, in the old Chorton, when  Cammerton was the higher of<br/>the two because of the cornetti. As cornetti  began to be used more in<br/>churches, the organ were jacked up to agree with  them.</p><p>Johnny:  Are you saying that the wooden  cornetti couldn&apos;t have their pitched<br/>changed more easily than organs?  Are  you saying they were only able to be<br/>constructed smaller rather than  larger?  This seem really odd.</p><p>Paul:  Only later did<br/>the two switch  place.</p><p>Johnny: Yes, I know about the switches.   Praetorius had a part to play in<br/>recognizing this phenomenon.  And Kuhnau  got some credit for the swithc, I<br/>remember from somewhere, for making a change  in Leipzig.</p><p>PauL:  Did 16th musicians somehow feel less  of a need<br/>to be close to God?</p><p>Johnny: This is not a polemic, only that a  different generation has<br/>different emphases.  There is no reason to deride  a congregation adding a new aspect<br/>to their devotion.  Incidentally, this  was not an original idea, but one I<br/>retrieved from &quot;Tuning of Music&quot; by R.  Murray Schaefer, a work based mainly on<br/>different amplitudes of sound around the  world.</p><p>Paul:  Plus I don&apos;t think there is much  stock in your<br/>suggestion that intent was &quot;to get God&apos;s attention&quot;. When we  are<br/>dealing with an ostensibly omnipotent and omnipresent being,  by<br/>definition you&apos;ve already got his attention. No, I suspect it was  more<br/>so to put the FEAR of God into the church goers, and for that  it<br/>merely needs to be loud.</p><p>Johnny: whatever</p><p>&gt; Fourthly, there was  no pitch standard, with<br/>&gt; pitches set at different rates in different  churches in the same<br/>city. And there<br/>&gt; was no standard of pitch between  Chor and Kammer pitches. A whole<br/>tone apart<br/>&gt; does not tell anyone what  kind of whole tone is intended.</p><p>Paul: That is more or less true but only  when you want to pin it down to<br/>something as small as the difference between  various believable whole<br/>sizes. This assertion is generally disproved by the  number of<br/>instruments built with transposing keyboards (like the early 18th  c<br/>Frankfurt cathedral organ, that could slide manuals and pedal by a<br/>minor  third, making all half step stops along the way), and the truly<br/>vast number  of sources talking about the organist needing to transpose<br/>up or down a whole  tone in order to play with winds pitched<br/>differently.</p><p>Johnny: Um, don&apos;t you realize that this is true  _only_ in meantone?  Man,<br/>there is another part to music making that  you seem to be missing.  Slide<br/>manuals were made by Silbermann for use with  his meantone keyboards.  In<br/>contradistinction, irregular tunings (where  each key is distinctive sounding) can not<br/>make transpositions without changing  character, even sentiment.  That&apos;s<br/>another valuable Kirnberger lesson;  modulation outside of a close key is harmful<br/>to the meaning of the music.   It would be much like Tom has warned, changing<br/>the meaning of the music by  changing one meantone variant for another.</p><p>Paul:  Or works like the Krebs Fantasy for  organ and oboe, with<br/>the manuscript organ part written in f minor (!) and the  oboe in g<br/>minor (could be a case of subsemitones).</p><p>Johnny:  Um, with all respect, you are  missing out on a different but<br/>concurrent musical aesthetic.  It&apos;s like the  lute, or the bagpipes, something<br/>outside the conservative status quo.  The  Krebs situation was likely in<br/>Werckmeister III.  If so, then the oboe would  be a whole step flat to the organ.  For<br/>them to match, but only as close as  possible to non-church pitch interactions,<br/>the oboe reads g to the organist  playing in f.  The oboist still has to<br/>match the actual pitch of g minor no  matter what notation is on the paper.</p><p>written<br/>f<br/>0  90  198  294   390  498  594  702  792  894  996  1092</p><p>sounding<br/>g<br/>0  96  192  300  396   504  594  696  798  894  1002  1092</p><p>Accordingly, the oboist has a large difference in  fifth.  Other intervals<br/>are six cents apart.  The composer Krebs must  have wanted the key of g minor,<br/>transposing the oboe as best as possible to  allow them to play together.<br/>Mattheson wrote about how funny this process  normally sounds.  But it didn&apos;t stop<br/>Bach&apos;s St. Matthew&apos;s Passion, perhaps  Bach&apos;s greatest chromatic achievement,<br/>still unheard outside of ET.  If it  was truly in ET, it would never have<br/>needed to have retained both church and  chamber pitch.</p><p>Have you read Haynes/Story of  A?</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p><p>Johnny: I know of Haynes&apos;s writing, but not Story  of A.

The above quote demonstrates nothing other<br/>than Beethoven wanted to present his student with a good selection of<br/>current literature on composition. It says nothing about whether or<br/>not B subscribed to any of the ideas contained therein.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  Kinrnberger&apos;s KRS is a big work  covering lots of stuff.

You lambaste the fellow, and<br/>then begin<br/>&gt; hedging.</p><p>I don&apos;t see what is unfair about drawing a distinction between<br/>different aspects of Kirnberger&apos;s work. I don&apos;t take an &quot;all or<br/>nothing&quot; approach to anybody&apos;s work. I have always held that<br/>Kirnberger was an amateur in the field of temperament ONLY. His level<br/>of sophistication/expertise in the aspects of aesthetics and<br/>composition I leave to other musicologists who are better versed in<br/>the historical conditions in these fields. I agree completely with<br/>Sorge and Marpurg that anyone who needed a monochord in the 1770&apos;s to<br/>set ET was seriously lacking in tuning/tempering skills, and by no<br/>means could be considered to be any sort of expert on the topic.<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s assertion that the ear can only &quot;know&quot; pure intervals is<br/>absolutely true, but any accomplished tuner knows various tricks to<br/>accurately define tempered intervals. In this respect, he was simply<br/>incompetent.</p><p>The only thing &quot;unfair&quot; about this is you trying to create a point of<br/>contention where there is none.</p><p>&gt; You really just don&apos;t  know.<br/>&gt; Kirnberger III is only a bow towards just,and this serves<br/>Beethoven&apos;s piano<br/>&gt; music well.</p><p>&gt;  As an example, listen to the Moonlight  Sonata in the radio archive<br/>&gt; of the AFMM web site _www.afmm.org_ (<a href="http://www.afmm.org">http://www.afmm.org</a>)<br/>&gt; played by Joshua Pierce.

So what?</p><p>I&apos;m not talking about KIII, which represents Kirnberger backing down<br/>on his own principles after Marpurg, Sorge, and others heaped scorn<br/>upon his two 12 comma fifths. I think we must treat any application of<br/>KIII in regards to late 18th/early 19th c music with great suspicion,<br/>since we have absolutely no idea if anybody knew about it expect<br/>Forkel until its publication in the 1880&apos;s. And as for KII, I can<br/>assure I am not tone deaf, I just don&apos;t like the sound of that many<br/>Pythagorean thirds, nor can I believe that anybody excepted so many of<br/>them in this time period precisely because of the number of sources<br/>complaining about the ugly sound of ET thirds. But you are free to<br/>like what you will, and believe what you will, of course, since beauty<br/>is in the ear of the beholder. You can rest assured I won&apos;t accuse you<br/>of being &quot;tone deaf&quot;. . . historically suspect, perhaps, but tone<br/>deaf?! No way. . .</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  Woodwinds were built at many different pitches at many  different<br/>&gt; times. They sound different, I hesitate to say &quot;better&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  That&apos;s because you are not a  woodwind player.  Even a half<br/>step<br/>&gt; flatter, and I&apos;m sure Mr. Haynes would  agree, makes for a warmer<br/>sound in the<br/>&gt; instrument.  In this regard,  Frederick the Great had been pushing<br/>for the<br/>&gt; lowest pitches so he would sound  best.  Warmer is better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  Depends on<br/>&gt; what you are after; a  mellow, warm sound, or a bright piquant sound.<br/>&gt; It just so happens that  bassons and clarinets were largely of French<br/>&gt; origins, and French pitch was  low<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Actually, there is a different  between the German &quot;fagot&quot;<br/>and the<br/>&gt; French &quot;basson&quot; in that they are completely  different instruments<br/>to play with<br/>&gt; the German instrument played dark due to a  heavy spine running down<br/>the<br/>&gt; reed, and the French emphasizing the higher  register with a reedier<br/>or &quot;buzzier&quot;<br/>&gt; sound (an little if any spine).</p><p>There is nothing German about the word &quot;Fagot&quot; nor French about the<br/>word &quot;Bassoon&quot; in regards to the early forms of the bassoon. Both<br/>words are of French origin, and Mersenne spoke of a breakdown dulcian<br/>as being &quot;fagoted&quot;. The first use of the term &quot;fagot&quot; to name an<br/>instrument directly is in Italy, the Choristfagot. In the 18th<br/>century, bassoon was also used in German-speaking lands. The sort of<br/>nationalistic differences in terminology, sound, and reed making of<br/>which you speak are aspects of periods beyond that which we are<br/>discussing, and certainly have no relevance whatsoever to the origins<br/>of the instrument.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m  sure the oboes that were longer sounded<br/>&gt; better than otherwise and were  associated with lower kammer pitch.</p><p>Ah, well the first and last part of your statement go automatically<br/>together, unless we include French opera pitch in the gamma of<br/>possibilities. As to the middle part, &quot;better&quot; is subjective, but if<br/>we accept your defention of warmer=better, than French Opera pitch<br/>wins over kammer pitch.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Secondly, organ parts are cheaper when the pipes  are smaller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This idea was floating around the Netherlands 15 years ago  or so, but<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know anybody who believes it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  The people who wrote about it, like  Werckmeister, believed it.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember reading a passage in Werckmeister saying such, but<br/>then I haven&apos;t read all of Werckmeister. Could you give us the quote,<br/>please?</p><p>&gt; Johnny:  Are you saying that the wooden  cornetti couldn&apos;t have<br/>their pitched<br/>&gt; changed more easily than organs?  Are  you saying they were only<br/>able to be<br/>&gt; constructed smaller rather than  larger?</p><p>Yep, that seems to be the historical evidence. Trumpets and Cornetti<br/>in Cornetton, or Trompetton, which is why they are so called (didn&apos;t<br/>you ever wonder about that?). Don&apos;t ask me why, that&apos;s just the way it<br/>was. And yes, the organs were raised in pitch to match them. Don&apos;t ask<br/>me why, that&apos;s just the historical fact. Go read Haynes/Story of A.</p><p>&gt;  This seem really odd.</p><p>Man, there are so many odd things about the history of instrument<br/>making it&apos;ll make your head spin if you ever start to get into it.</p><p>In general, your understanding of the origins and development of wind<br/>instruments seems to be flawed, perhaps based on incomplete<br/>information or a series of assumptions which have little basis in<br/>historical fact. For instance, in your first post in this exchange you<br/>stated that:</p><p>&quot;Firstly, woods sound better when they can be elongated a bit (note<br/>the early music fixation on 415 hertz).  This is why English Horn and<br/>bass clarinet developed.&quot;</p><p>Wrong on all counts.</p><p>Count 1. The adoption of 415 as the modern &quot;Baroque&quot; pitch comes from<br/>a mid-20th c misunderstanding of the complex nature of pitch levels in<br/>the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Many people believed that pitch<br/>rose, being lowest in old times and highest at the end of the 19th<br/>century before musicians put there foot down and demanded a fixed<br/>standard at 440 - or so the story goes. So 415 was seen as being &quot;the&quot;<br/>old pitch, before it rose a lot. Nothing could be further from the<br/>truth, of course, and now we know that 415 was but one of 4 common and<br/>5 less common general pitch levels, from 390 to 490. it just so<br/>happens that since the modern early music movement comes largely from<br/>Dutch and German speaking lands, they gravitated towards the normal<br/>Cammerton pitch, because that is what the artifacts of their musical<br/>tradition indicated was the case. Nowadays, some people argue that we<br/>really ought to be performing at 390, 440 and 465 as well, and<br/>occasionally it is done, though the economics of needing to buy<br/>instruments pitched at these levels is far too often prohibitive.</p><p>Count 2. The modern English Horn is nothing other than the direct<br/>descendent of the tenor oboe in F, which was just another member of<br/>the oboe consort or oboe band. These consorts of interments were made<br/>at whatever pitch level was locally required. A warmer sound due to a<br/>longer length has absolutely nothing to do with either the appearance<br/>or the development of the instrument.</p><p>Count 3. Ditto the bass clarinet. The earliest examples, from the end<br/>of the 18th century, were probably intended to replace the bassoon in<br/>military marching bands, and in fact they resemble the bassoon in<br/>structure. Again, they simply performed a musical function in<br/>producing the bass voice for that particular family; warmth of sound<br/>had nothing to do with the introduction of a longer version of the<br/>instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: Um, don&apos;t you realize that this is true  _only_ in meantone?<br/> Man,<br/>&gt; there is another part to music making that  you seem to be missing.<br/> Slide<br/>&gt; manuals were made by Silbermann for use with  his meantone<br/>keyboards.  In<br/>&gt; contradistinction, irregular tunings (where  each key is distinctive<br/>sounding) can not<br/>&gt; make transpositions without changing  character, even sentiment.<br/>That&apos;s<br/>&gt; another valuable Kirnberger lesson;  modulation outside of a close<br/>key is harmful<br/>&gt; to the meaning of the music.   It would be much like Tom has warned,<br/>changing<br/>&gt; the meaning of the music by  changing one meantone variant for another.</p><p>I&apos;m not talking about a seamless transposition in which the music<br/>sounds exactly the same except for pitch level. I&apos;m not stupid, and I<br/>realize just as well as anyone that distribution is different for<br/>every key in any circulating temperament. I just don&apos;t think it was<br/>all that important to them. The did what they had to with the tools<br/>the had at hand, and if on this Sunday it required the organist to<br/>transpose, than so be it. I seriously doubt that precise key quality<br/>was of any importance to any composer. Naturally they were aware of<br/>the traditional location of harsh sounding keys, and they could be<br/>avoided or used for effect. But the precise quality of any particular<br/>chord was something they simply could not know with a any general<br/>consistency, only with regards to a particular instrument they knew or<br/>tuned themselves. To suggest that Bach or anyone else would write any<br/>particular piece with an absolutely specific chord quality for each<br/>and every triad in mind is ludicrous. I know a number of people on<br/>this list are of the opposite opinion, and it provides a wonderful<br/>outlet for endless intellectual speculation, and endless debate, as<br/>each person constructs ever more convincing arguments to support their<br/>particular vision of &quot;Bach&apos;s temperament&quot; and compiles endless lists<br/>of particular moments in particular piece that &quot;prove&quot; that this<br/>temperament was used by Bach. That&apos;s all very fine and good, though I<br/>don&apos;t think the surviving comments support such hair splitting, and I<br/>think it is more a disease of our modern times than any historically<br/>accurate attitude towards music. I doubt anybody in the 18th century,<br/>upon sitting down to play through the WTC, would have thought, &quot;Ah,<br/>but first I must tune Bach&apos;s temperament, otherwise the music will not<br/>sound as it should.&quot; Any circulating temp will more or less do.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  Or works like the Krebs Fantasy for  organ and oboe, with<br/>&gt; the manuscript organ part written in f minor (!) and the  oboe in g<br/>&gt; minor (could be a case of subsemitones).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Um, with all respect, you are  missing out on a different but<br/>&gt; concurrent musical aesthetic.  It&apos;s like the  lute, or the bagpipes,<br/>something<br/>&gt; outside the conservative status quo.</p><p>How so? The lute was central to &quot;status quo&quot; music making, a common<br/>member of the continuo ensemble. To say nothing of the various &quot;status<br/>quo&quot; composers for the lute, like Weiss. Bagpipes, yes, definitely a<br/>folk instrument, often straight JI, considering they played in a very<br/>limited number of keys - like the hurdy-gurdy.</p><p>&gt; The  Krebs situation was likely in<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III.</p><p>How do you know? Have you got some evidence for the tuning of Kreb&apos;s<br/>organ when he wrote this piece?</p><p>&gt;  If so, then the oboe would  be a whole step flat to the organ.</p><p>Temperament choice has absolutely nothing to do with respective pitch<br/>levels. The organ was at Cornetton and the oboe in Cammerton,<br/>obviously. The oboe simply WAS a whole step flat relative to the<br/>organ; &quot;if so&quot; has no meaning here, as the case would be the same no<br/>matter what temperament the organ was in.</p><p>&gt; For<br/>&gt; them to match, but only as close as  possible to non-church pitch<br/>interactions,<br/>&gt; the oboe reads g to the organist  playing in f.</p><p>Duh! That&apos;s the way Krebs wrote it.</p><p>&gt;  The oboist still has to<br/>&gt; match the actual pitch of g minor no  matter what notation is on the<br/>paper.</p><p>Wrong. The oboist, reading/fingering/playing g, or b-flat, or d simply<br/>has to match whatever sounds come out of the organ when the organist<br/>plays a f, a-flat, or c. And so on. No big mystery, hardly worthy the<br/>effort of explaining, even if you explain it correctly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; written<br/>&gt; f<br/>&gt; 0  90  198  294   390  498  594  702  792  894  996  1092<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sounding<br/>&gt; g<br/>&gt; 0  96  192  300  396   504  594  696  798  894  1002  1092<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Accordingly, the oboist has a large difference in  fifth.  Other<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; are six cents apart.</p><p>What are you on about, here? If the organ is tuned in WIII at<br/>Cornetton, the &quot;written&quot; values you give are also the &quot;sounding&quot;<br/>values when the organist plays in f-minor. There is no discrepancy.</p><p>What values the oboist can produce when he plays in g minor is<br/>anybody&apos;s guess, though normally g minor is a &quot;good&quot; minor key on the<br/>oboe, having proper high flats and low sharps, and relatively pure<br/>fifths in the basic triads. But as you yourself stated, the idea of<br/>fixing hard and fast numbers to wind intonation is highly suspect. I<br/>don&apos;t see the point of this exercise.</p><p>&gt;  The composer Krebs must  have wanted the key of g minor,<br/>&gt; transposing the oboe as best as possible to  allow them to play<br/>together.</p><p>Neither part transposes. They both play as written. What key he<br/>&quot;wanted&quot; is not really a valid question, unless the background<br/>assumption is regular meantone with 12 notes to the octave, which<br/>seems unlikely, in which case the difference between g minor and f<br/>minor would be extreme. Sure, if it&apos;s a piece about wailing and<br/>gnashing of teeth, that&apos;s another story, but this fantasy doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to have that sort of feel to it. I&apos;ve played it in f-minor in<br/>meantone, it just sounds like shit.</p><p>There&apos;s no great mystery here, the only question is what kind of<br/>temperament the organ had. There are only two realistic possibilities.<br/>First, some sort of circulating temperament which lessened the<br/>meantone sourness of f minor. In this case, the oboist just matched<br/>the less than ideal intonation as much as possible, or more likely,<br/>deviated from it as much as tolerable towards flexible JI, as Rameau<br/>said good singers did, and as Ibo&apos;s latest research suggests was<br/>common practice for solo melody instruments with flexible intonation.<br/>The main problem with this hypothesis is that Ibo&apos;s work strongly<br/>implies there is little support for the application of circulating<br/>temperaments to organs of this period, including your assumed WIII. In<br/>any case, IF the organ WAS tuned in some circulating temperament, then<br/>what key Kreb&apos;s &quot;wanted&quot; was whatever sort of mishmash comes out of<br/>combining that particular fixed f-minor with whatever the oboe was<br/>capable of getting away with in his somewhat flexible g minor. About<br/>all we can say is that it is obviously he was letting the oboe play in<br/>one of the easiest and best-intoned minor keys on the instrument.</p><p>The other possibility is that the organ was tuned in regular meantone<br/>and had subsemitones (&quot;split sharps&quot;), as many did, although by Kreb&apos;s<br/>time they were becoming less common. If the instrument had separate<br/>keys for a real Ab and Db, there would have been no problem, as there<br/>would have been no conflict between oboe and organ.</p><p>Either solution is musically acceptable, considering the aesthetics of<br/>the time, and if the organ part was played by a small positive, the<br/>circulating temperament solution is perfectly believable. Brad&apos;s<br/>temperament, for example, or Werckmeister&apos;s continuo temperament, when<br/>pushed to the limits of circulating (1/7 comma tempering, for<br/>example), both make f-minor tolerable if not ideal. I&apos;ve tried it both<br/>ways, it sounds fine. But then, I&apos;m tone deaf, so what do I know?<br/>Registration can also help soften sour intonation, as a stopped flute<br/>hides a multitude of sins compared to an open diapason, though asking<br/>it to make 1/4 meantone f-minor sound like anything other than sucking<br/>on lemons is pushing it.</p><p>&gt; Mattheson wrote about how funny this process  normally sounds.  But<br/>it didn&apos;t stop<br/>&gt; Bach&apos;s St. Matthew&apos;s Passion, perhaps  Bach&apos;s greatest chromatic<br/>achievement,<br/>&gt; still unheard outside of ET.  If it  was truly in ET, it would never<br/>have<br/>&gt; needed to have retained both church and  chamber pitch.</p><p>In the manuscript parts, I guess you mean. On the contrary, once<br/>again, the choice of temperament has nothing to do with relative<br/>scoring of the parts. If your winds are at Cammerton and the organ in<br/>Cornetton, they simply are written a step apart, ET or otherwise. No<br/>big mystery, no great hidden significance. Over and over and over<br/>again in the historical literature we read that the pitch level of the<br/>winds is the arbiter of everything. This is because they were not yet<br/>fully chromatic instruments, and playing in certain keys was not an<br/>option. Keyboards, on the other hand, can be tuned and/or constructed<br/>in such a manner that far more keys are possible, so it is the<br/>keyboard player who must transpose, either at sight, or written out<br/>(like Krebs), or with the assistance of mechanical devices.</p><p>I just had an experience last spring when tuning for the Nederlands<br/>Bachvereeniging. They did a program of all Buxthude in a number of<br/>churches around the country. The central piece was Schlagt, K&uuml;nstler,<br/>die Pauken (BuxWV 122), in which they did the large choruses with the<br/>large organ. The organs were tuned at either 440 or 465, and a variety<br/>of temperaments, though none was in meantone. The orchestra tuned 415,<br/>so the organist had to transpose by either a half or a whole step. My<br/>job was to tune the harpsi and the traveling positive organ in a<br/>temperament that satisfied the wind players intonation and was not too<br/>far from the various organ temperaments. After much discussion and<br/>deliberation between the organist, the director, and the winds, we<br/>decided on a Neidhardt 1724 Kleine/1732 Grosse at 415. It was a<br/>wonderful lesson in what sort of problems they were dealing with, and<br/>it was also a great lesson about how much actual intonation<br/>disagreement you can get away with in that sort of acoustic. Anybody<br/>who thinks that it is important to define things down to 4 or 5 cents<br/>up or down is simply not being realistic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you read Haynes/Story of  A?</p><p>&gt; Johnny: I know of Haynes&apos;s writing, but not Story  of A.  I tried to<br/>contact<br/>&gt; him in Canada, but I must have had an old  address.</p><p>I am not surprised to hear that you haven&apos;t read this, because so many<br/>of your statements seem to contradict the historical record. I suggest<br/>you get it as soon as possible. You can buy the book on Amazon, or<br/>directly from Scarecrow press. You don&apos;t have to order it from Bruce<br/>directly. I would also suggest you read Rita Steblin&apos;s excellent book<br/>on the history of key affects, it might cause you to reconsider many<br/>of your assertions and attitudes.</p><p>Happy Trails!</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/22/2007 9:29:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi  Paul,<br/>It was  previosly not possible to divine clearly that the &ldquo;only&rdquo; thing you<br/>didn&rsquo;t like  about Kirnberger was his second temperament.  I am relieved.  J</p><p>Paul: I  agree completely with<br/>Sorge and Marpurg that anyone who needed a monochord in  the 1770&apos;s to<br/>set ET was seriously lacking in tuning/tempering skills, and by  no<br/>means could be considered to be any sort of expert on the  topic.<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s assertion that the ear can only &quot;know&quot; pure intervals  is<br/>absolutely true, but any accomplished tuner knows various tricks  to<br/>accurately define tempered intervals. In this respect, he was  simply<br/>incompetent.<br/>Johnny: um,  you may have to eat your words, Paul.  While Kirnberger did say<br/>what he said, he actually did not have any  difficultly tuning ET without a<br/>monochord.  As reported by Claude Palisca in his translation, and published by<br/>Kirnberger in his Vermischte  Musicalien (1769):<br/>&ldquo;Kirnberger had discovered a tempered  fifth whose ratio (10935:16384) is<br/>almost exactly 1/12 of a comma smaller than  the pure fifth.  Kirnbeger arrived<br/>at this ratio in the process of developing his own temperament.  The method by<br/>which he arrived at this  figure was to take seven pure fifths in succession<br/>plus one pure major  third.  This gives the tempered  fourth 8192:10935, which<br/>is larger than the pure fourth by 1/12 of a comma; its  inversion is the<br/>tempered fifth 10935:16384.  According to Kirnbeger, he showed this  discovery to<br/>the mathematician Leonahard Euler in 1766 a, and remarked to him  that this<br/>tempered fifth could be used to determine all ratios of equal  temperament.<br/>This idea was  subsequently developed by Johann Heinrich Lambert and published in<br/>the Memoires de l&rsquo;academie royale des sciences  et belle letters (Berlin,<br/>1774), pp. 64ff.<br/>&ldquo;Lambert&rsquo;s  method of determining the fifth 10935:16384, which indeed does<br/>bear a remarkable  resemblance to Kinrberger&rsquo;s was reported by Marpurg in his<br/>Versuch&mldr;  (He [Marpurg] later translated Lambert&rsquo;s  essay into German and &mldr;<br/>Marpurg praised Lambert&rsquo;s method and pointed out that  its deviations from exact<br/>equal temperament never exceed .00001.  Another advantage of this method is<br/>that  it does not require a monochord.  Marpurg, who supported equal<br/>temperament and was violently opposed to  Kirnberger&rsquo;s views on temperament as well as<br/>on harmony, was only too eager to  point out that this feature of Lambert&rsquo;s<br/>method invalidated one of Kirnberger&rsquo;s  objections to equal temperament (p. 20).&rdquo;</p><p>Paul:  The only thing  &quot;unfair&quot; about this is you trying to create a point of<br/>contention where there  is none.</p><p>Johnny: Crocodile tears!  You call the man incompetent and mischaracterize<br/>his ears and  intellect.<br/>Kirnberger&rsquo;s  expose on tuning ET by more secretive methods is now out before<br/>your  eyes.<br/>&mldr;.</p><p>Paul:  I&apos;m not talking about  KIII, which represents Kirnberger backing down<br/>on his own principles after  Marpurg, Sorge, and others heaped scorn<br/>upon his two 12 comma fifths.<br/>Johnny:  F#!@ scorn.  I scorn Marpurg.  Vicentino was scorned.  Timotheus was<br/>scorned.  Harry Partch was corned.  Who cares if an arse like Marpurg scorns<br/>Kirnberger?  It was all about  agenda.  Maybe still  now?<br/>Paul:  I just don&apos;t like the sound of that  many<br/>Pythagorean thirds, nor can I believe that anybody excepted so many  of<br/>them in this time period precisely because of the number of  sources<br/>complaining about the ugly sound of ET thirds.<br/>Johnny:  Yes, it is clear you have stated a bias  against the ditone.  There<br/>were  Pythagorean ditones still being sung as hymns in churches, and ditones<br/>existed  in Werckmeister III, and there is a falling ditone when the NYC subway<br/>doors  close.  Rasch hates them, too.  Truth is, if you perform Kirnberger&rsquo;s<br/>music, as we have, you won&rsquo;t find a ditone being heard in that awful way you<br/>object to.  The composer Kirnberger  favors the intervals that are just or<br/>nearby.<br/>Paul: But  you are free to<br/>like what you will, and believe what you will, of course,  since beauty<br/>is in the ear of the beholder. You can rest assured I won&apos;t  accuse you<br/>of being &quot;tone deaf&quot;. . . historically suspect, perhaps, but  tone<br/>deaf?! No way. . .</p><p>Johnny:  Hah, Hah, what did you  hear&mldr;?<br/>Paul:  There is nothing German about the word  &quot;Fagot&quot; nor French about the<br/>word &quot;Bassoon&quot; in regards to the early forms of  the bassoon. Both<br/>words are of French origin, and Mersenne spoke of a  breakdown dulcian<br/>as being &quot;fagoted&quot;. The first use of the term &quot;fagot&quot; to  name an<br/>instrument directly is in Italy, the Choristfagot. In the  18th<br/>century, bassoon was also used in German-speaking lands. The sort  of<br/>nationalistic differences in terminology, sound, and reed making  of<br/>which you speak are aspects of periods beyond that which we  are<br/>discussing, and certainly have no relevance whatsoever to the  origins<br/>of the instrument.</p><p>Johnny:  I&rsquo;m not sure when the two instrument  diverged, mechanically, when<br/>keys were included.  One thing is for sure, no one playing a  German (Heckel)<br/>bassoon can play a French (Buffet) bassoon, or vice  versa.<br/>More  importantly, the fagot being French will likely surprise a lot of<br/>Germans.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Secondly, organ parts are cheaper when the pipes are  smaller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This idea was floating around the Netherlands 15 years ago or so,  but<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know anybody who believes it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: The  people who wrote about it, like Werckmeister, believed it.</p><p>Paul:  I don&apos;t remember reading a passage in  Werckmeister saying such, but<br/>then I haven&apos;t read all of Werckmeister. Could  you give us the quote,<br/>please?</p><p>Johnny:  I&rsquo;ll try to find it for you.  I should be able to come across it<br/>again  by the end of the week.</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: Are you saying that the wooden cornetti  &gt; This seem really  odd.</p><p>Paul:  In general, your  understanding of the origins and development of wind<br/>instruments seems to be  flawed, perhaps based on incomplete<br/>information or a series of assumptions  which have little basis in<br/>historical fact. For instance, in your first post  in this exchange you<br/>stated that:</p><p>Johnny:  You might have tried, &ldquo;&rsquo;may&rsquo; be flawed&rdquo;  and stop assuming you are<br/>all that.  I am trying to weigh every new thing I learn from you, and<br/>elsewhere.  Pomposity does not earn  you any credits.</p><p>&quot;Firstly, woods sound better when they can be elongated a bit  (note<br/>the early music fixation on 415 hertz). This is why English Horn  and<br/>bass clarinet developed.&quot;</p><p>Wrong on all counts.</p><p>Count 1. The  adoption of 415 as the modern &quot;Baroque&quot; pitch comes from<br/>a mid-20th c  misunderstanding of the complex nature of pitch levels in<br/>the 16th, 17th, and  18th centuries. Many people believed that pitch<br/>rose, being lowest in old  times and highest at the end of the 19th<br/>century before musicians put there  foot down and demanded a fixed<br/>standard at 440 - or so the story goes. So 415  was seen as being &quot;the&quot;<br/>old pitch, before it rose a lot. Nothing could be  further from the<br/>truth, of course, and now we know that 415 was but one of 4  common and<br/>5 less common general pitch levels, from 390 to 490. it just  so<br/>happens that since the modern early music movement comes largely  from<br/>Dutch and German speaking lands, they gravitated towards the  normal<br/>Cammerton pitch, because that is what the artifacts of their  musical<br/>tradition indicated was the case. Nowadays, some people argue that  we<br/>really ought to be performing at 390, 440 and 465 as well,  and<br/>occasionally it is done, though the economics of needing to  buy<br/>instruments pitched at these levels is far too often prohibitive.</p><p>Johnny:  Count 1.  What crap!  Yeah, it&rsquo;s all a big understanding.  So let&rsquo;s<br/>change back, or do they like  segregation in a modern mimicry of the old<br/>church (your conettone) and chamber  pitch.  Um, could it be the  instruments even<br/>a half step lower enrich the warmth of the instruments as they  play in<br/>resonant venues?  Makes  sense to me.  However 415 started,  it is maintained by<br/>what I have just alluded to.</p><p>Count 2.  The modern English Horn is nothing other than the direct<br/>descendent of the  tenor oboe in F, which was just another member of<br/>the oboe consort or oboe  band. These consorts of interments were made<br/>at whatever pitch level was  locally required. A warmer sound due to a<br/>longer length has absolutely  nothing to do with either the appearance<br/>or the development of the  instrument.</p><p>Johnny:  You got me there.  I got carried away.  Almost wanted to say<br/>contrabassoon.  But there is something to warmer  climates allowing for the lower<br/>pitched instruments.  It may have come from Hanes, somewhere.</p><p>Paul:  Count 3. Ditto the  bass clarinet. The earliest examples, from the end<br/>of the 18th century, were  probably intended to replace the bassoon in<br/>military marching bands, and in  fact they resemble the bassoon in<br/>structure. Again, they simply performed a  musical function in<br/>producing the bass voice for that particular family;  warmth of sound<br/>had nothing to do with the introduction of a longer version  of the<br/>instrument.<br/>Johnny:  Well, I can&rsquo;t resist; do you know the  Quintfagot?  I was hunting<br/>one down  in Europe to play on, but after listening to  every tenoroon I could<br/>find, I passed on it.  they sound to small they have no tone,  they went to far<br/>in the smaller side of things (maybe great for youngsters with  small hands<br/>and fingers).  The  reason bassoons are not in marching bands is because if<br/>someone ever stopped  suddenly in front of a bassoonist, his reed would slash<br/>through his or her  throat.  That is the reason the  bassoon is outlawed in<br/>marching bands in certain  states.<br/>Surprised  you didn&rsquo;t bring up the Sarusophone family, or even the<br/>Ophecleides.  Were they replacements for bassoons,  too?<br/>&gt;<br/>&mldr;.</p><p>Paul:  I&apos;m not talking about  a seamless transposition in which the music<br/>sounds exactly the same except  for pitch level. I&apos;m not stupid, and I<br/>realize just as well as anyone that  distribution is different for<br/>every key in any circulating temperament. I  just don&apos;t think it was<br/>all that important to them. The did what they had to  with the tools<br/>the had at hand, and if on this Sunday it required the  organist to<br/>transpose, than so be it. I seriously doubt that precise key  quality<br/>was of any importance to any composer.<br/>Johnny:  Disagree.<br/>Paul:  To suggest that Bach or anyone else  would write any<br/>particular piece with an absolutely specific chord quality  for each<br/>and every triad in mind is ludicrous.<br/>Johnny: As  an extreme, yes.  But to choose D  minor as a starting point for<br/>the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue because it is the  most just key in the<br/>circular well temperament, as it would be in Werckmeister  III, is certainly to be<br/>aware of key character.<br/>Paul:  &mldr;.more a disease of our modern times than  any historically<br/>accurate attitude towards music. I doubt anybody in the 18th  century,<br/>upon sitting down to play through the WTC, would have thought,  &quot;Ah,<br/>but first I must tune Bach&apos;s temperament, otherwise the music will  not<br/>sound as it should.&quot; Any circulating temp will more or less do.</p><p>Johnny:  The Well-tempered Clavier is as you  describe.  More to teach the<br/>fingers  the lay of the land than to supplement the ear with a deeper dimension<br/>through  distinction.  But a piece the St.  Matthew&rsquo;s Passion might make much<br/>more of a difference, regardless of the  titles.<br/>As  for your transposition idea, the Mattheson quote I mentioned earlier has<br/>been  located, about how he never liked the &ldquo;abominations&rdquo; caused by force<br/>fitting a  chamber pitched instrument with a church pitched instrument, always a<br/>risk when  transposing in a well temperament.<br/>But  consider the abomination when instruments tuned in Cammerton such as<br/>horns,  bassoons, etc. are sometimes expected to play with others that are in<br/>Chorton,  so that either one group or the other must be transposed; is that sound<br/>any  different than if the composer or Cantor wished to portray the quarrel<br/>of the  hounds over the fallen body of Jesabel? (Haynes, dissertation, p. 257).</p><p>By this  quote, it seems Mr. Haynes certainly see the other  side.<br/>&mldr;..</p><p>Paul:  How so? The lute was  central to &quot;status quo&quot; music making, a common<br/>member of the continuo  ensemble. To say nothing of the various &quot;status<br/>quo&quot; composers for the lute,  like Weiss. Bagpipes, yes, definitely a<br/>folk instrument, often straight JI,  considering they played in a very<br/>limited number of keys - like the  hurdy-gurdy.</p><p>Johnny:  The lute is an oddball which is why  Dowland could create a tuning<br/>just for it.  The lute is used when in a good lute key, not just any key.  Aren&rsquo;<br/>t certain keys better for lute as  they are for guitar?  As for  bagpipes,<br/>check out Podnos&rsquo;s book on bagpipe intonation for a huge variety of<br/>microtonally different bagpipe tunings found throughout Europe.  Maybe  I should have<br/>added alphorn, but it is all too often played today in equal  temperament.</p><p>&gt; The  Krebs situation was likely in<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III.</p><p>Paul:  How do you know? Have you got some  evidence for the tuning of Kreb&apos;s<br/>organ when he wrote this piece?</p><p>Johnny:  Right now, I don&rsquo;t know.  I don&rsquo;t have the music in my hands and<br/>am functionally blind.  Besides,  your using the term cornettone when I had<br/>been using Chor or church pitch blurs  a bit.  My assumption of Krebs  having<br/>Werckmeister III simply stems from WIII being the first published  circular<br/>tuning in Bach&rsquo;s neck of the woods, and Krebs is a name associated with  Bach.  Too<br/>general for me to get  really analytical, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree.  I&rsquo;d want<br/>to see which notations he uses, check out the town and organ he  wrote for,<br/>etc.<br/>As for Ibo,  we do not agree about a number of things, and they have been<br/>discussed on the  List in years past.  It makes sense  that you would seem<br/>vehement about some of the same things.  One difference is that because there are<br/>no extant records that detail meantone to well temperament, you fellows deduce<br/>it didn&rsquo;t happen, like there was an express from meantone to ET.  I don&rsquo;t<br/>want to put words in your mouth,  but that&rsquo;s the sense I get.</p><p>We disagree  as to whether d minor is any different in sound and sentiment<br/>from e minor.  I think it does matter and you do  not.  And I think it mattered<br/>to  Bach.  As you were so generous to  allow me to hear whatever I want to<br/>hear, I graciously allow you to believe  whatever you want to believe.  Only,  I<br/>do not believe the story as it has been handed down.  To that end, I am re<br/>ordering the  categories into meantone (regular) and irregular.  To this end, a<br/>modified meantone is  better stated as an irregular.<br/>We don&rsquo;t  agree that there is such a thing as a Thuringian aesthetic toward<br/>unequalness,  variegation, and simple irregularity.  It is a bit more in the<br/>ethnomusicological realm.  It will be my task to explain that some  wanted the<br/>regularity of meantone, like they like they equalness of Vicenzo  Gallilei&rsquo;s<br/>archlute.  There were  democrats and republicans, or another version thereof.<br/>Each thinks they are the whole  enchilada.</p><p>Paul:  I would also suggest  you read Rita Steblin&apos;s excellent book<br/>on the history of key affects, it  might cause you to reconsider many<br/>of your assertions and attitudes.  Happy Trails!  P<br/>Johnny:  Thank you.  I am happy to have my own copy of Ms.  Steblin&rsquo;s book<br/>which I read very carefully.  I have quoted from it on occasion in my  new book<br/>(my second).  It is worth  noting that, like Barbour, Rita Steblin admits she<br/>had not heard any of the  tunings that her book seeks to describe.  Still, it<br/>is a valuable addition to scholarship.

Wouldn&apos;t sit well after the delicious roast lamb I&apos;ve<br/>just polished off for lunch.</p><p>&gt; While Kirnberger did say<br/>&gt; what he said,</p><p>I&apos;m glad to hear that! For a moment, I thought the poor guy was<br/>possesed by evil spirits forcing him to speak in tongues against his<br/>weill! But now that we have established that Kirnberger said what he<br/>said, we are still left with the issue of whether or not he actually<br/>said what *I* attributed to him, to wit: ET can&apos;t be tuned without a<br/>monochord.</p><p>&gt; he actually did not have any  difficultly tuning ET without a<br/>&gt; monochord.  As reported by Claude Palisca in his translation, and<br/>published by<br/>&gt; Kirnberger in his Vermischte  Musicalien (1769):<br/>&gt; &acirc;Kirnberger had discovered a tempered  fifth whose ratio<br/>(10935:16384) is<br/>&gt; almost exactly 1/12 of a comma smaller than  the pure fifth.<br/>Kirnbeger arrived<br/>&gt; at this ratio in the process of developing his own temperament.

So Kirnberger, all by his little old self, &quot;discovers&quot; the<br/>schisma in 1766, and then further &quot;discovers&quot; that it is equal to 1/12<br/>of a P comma! Oooo! Cutting edge stuff indeed! What did he do for an<br/>encore, &quot;discover&quot; the wheel? I mean, do you really think this<br/>represented a &quot;discovery&quot; in 1766? If anything, it just proves to me<br/>yet again how incompetent K was in this matter.</p><p>&gt; Another advantage of this method is<br/>&gt; that  it does not require a monochord.</p><p>Ahhhhh, how does that follow. Yes, you can set this one fifth without<br/>a monchord, but how does one then proceed to use it to finish the<br/>other 11 fifths? I suppose that having set up the initial fifth you<br/>could try to go all the way back around the circle doing the old 2:3<br/>beat rate shuffle, but the possiblity for cumulative error doing a 2:3<br/>comparison for a chain of 11 fifths is pretty extreme.</p><p>But of course, the main objection is this proves nothing, unless there<br/>is missing text you neglected to quote. Did Kirnberger ever SAY he<br/>uses this method to set ET on an instrument entirely by ear? The quote<br/>you give only says he could use this ratio to determine the ratios of<br/>all the other fifths. Now you know as well as I that knowing ratios is<br/>pointless when you sit down with tuning hammer in hand. The only time<br/>they come in handy is, ah, gee, well, when you are marking out a<br/>monochord. That&apos;s precisely when K &quot;could use this fifth to determine<br/>the RATIOS of all the other fifths.&quot; So we are back to square one, K<br/>using a monochord to tune ET. Your proof that it was otherwise proves<br/>nothing. I&apos;m heading for dessert of chocolate fondeau.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  The only thing  &quot;unfair&quot; about this is you trying to create a<br/>point of<br/>&gt; contention where there  is none.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: Crocodile tears!  You call the man incompetent and<br/>mischaracterize<br/>&gt; his ears and  intellect.</p><p>Uh, there you go again, making a mountain out of molehill. If I had<br/>some wackadoodle theory about brain surgery, some brain surgeon could<br/>well call me incompetent, which I am as a brain surgeon, and I<br/>wouldn&apos;t see it as an attack on my intellect. Only on my knowledge of<br/>brain surgery.</p><p>&gt; Kirnberger&acirc;s  expose on tuning ET by more secretive methods is now<br/>out before<br/>&gt; your  eyes.</p><p>Get off! I&apos;ve known this trick for at least 20 years or so. Always<br/>thought it was common knowledge: the Schisma = 1/12 comma. As old as<br/>the hills! &quot;Secret methods&quot; indeed!</p><p>&gt; Paul:  I just don&apos;t like the sound of that  many<br/>&gt; Pythagorean thirds, nor can I believe that anybody excepted so many  of<br/>&gt; them in this time period precisely because of the number of  sources<br/>&gt; complaining about the ugly sound of ET thirds.<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Yes, it is clear you have stated a bias  against the<br/>ditone.  There<br/>&gt; were  Pythagorean ditones still being sung as hymns in churches, and<br/>ditones<br/>&gt; existed  in Werckmeister III, and there is a falling ditone when the<br/>NYC subway<br/>&gt; doors  close.</p><p>Ah yes, but the relevant question is, what sonic signal did the Vienna<br/>subway use in Beethoven&apos;s time? Answer me that, if you will.</p><p>;-)</p><p>&gt;  Rasch hates them, too.  Truth is, if you perform Kirnberger&acirc;s<br/>&gt; music, as we have, you won&acirc;t find a ditone being heard in that<br/>awful way you<br/>&gt; object to.  The composer Kirnberger  favors the intervals that are<br/>just or<br/>&gt; nearby.</p><p>Ah, excuse me, but I thought we were talking about that OTHER composer<br/>guy, what was his name again?</p><p>Beethoven, that&apos;s it!</p><p>BTW, now that we are back on topic, what ever happened to you<br/>providing some evidence that Beethoven expressed a preference for K&apos;s<br/>temperament? Let alone the question of WHICH K temperament that might<br/>have been...</p><p>&gt;  One thing is for sure, no one playing a  German (Heckel)<br/>&gt; bassoon can play a French (Buffet) bassoon, or vice  versa.</p><p>Irrelevant to the discussion.</p><p>&gt; More  importantly, the fagot being French will likely surprise a lot of<br/>&gt; Germans.</p><p>Ach, die Deutscher! Also irrelevant to the discussion. Lots of things<br/>would surprise modern Germans, such as the fact that &quot;schweben&quot; didn&apos;t<br/>mean &quot;beating&quot; for Neidhardt to name but one. So what? Are modern<br/>Germans the repository of all wisdom and knowledge?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Count 1. The  adoption of 415 as the modern &quot;Baroque&quot; pitch comes from<br/>&gt; a mid-20th c  misunderstanding of the complex nature of pitch levels in<br/>&gt; the 16th, 17th, and  18th centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Count 1.  What crap!  Yeah, it&acirc;s all a big understanding.<br/> So let&acirc;s<br/>&gt; change back, or do they like  segregation in a modern mimicry of the<br/>old<br/>&gt; church (your conettone) and chamber  pitch.<br/>&gt;  Um, could it be the  instruments even<br/>&gt; a half step lower enrich the warmth of the instruments as they  play in<br/>&gt; resonant venues?  Makes  sense to me.  However 415 started,  it is<br/>maintained by<br/>&gt; what I have just alluded to.</p><p>I quote from Bruce Haynes introduction to A History of A, page xxi:</p><p>&quot;Thus history itself thorws down an uncomfortable challenge to the<br/>historically oriented performance movement. If we are interested in<br/>original sonorities, if we want our instruments to act and feel as<br/>they did for the composers who concieved their parts, it seems we have<br/>no choice but to renounce the luxory of a single hard-earned pitch<br/>standard. As in so many other issues of historical performance, when<br/>the outer layer of this onion is peeled away, it becomes evident that<br/>there is more beyond A-415, waiting to be revealed.&quot;</p><p>&gt; But there is something to warmer  climates allowing for the lower<br/>&gt; pitched instruments.  It may have come from Hanes, somewhere.</p><p>I doubt it, as Bruce certainly knows that Italy was by and large<br/>pitched high, circa 465, and here in Spain even higher yet, 490 or so<br/>in many cases.</p><p>&gt; As  for your transposition idea,</p><p>It&apos;s not MY idea, it&apos;s just what the old authors complain about and<br/>talk about endlessly, and what drove a lot of the circulating<br/>temperament development at the time.</p><p>&gt; the Mattheson quote I mentioned earlier has<br/>&gt; been  located, about how he never liked the &acirc;abominations&acirc;&#x9D;<br/>caused by force<br/>&gt; fitting a  chamber pitched instrument with a church pitched<br/>instrument, always a<br/>&gt; risk when  transposing in a well temperament.<br/>&gt; But  consider the abomination when instruments tuned in Cammerton<br/>such as<br/>&gt; horns,  bassoons, etc. are sometimes expected to play with others<br/>that are in<br/>&gt; Chorton,  so that either one group or the other must be transposed;<br/>is that sound<br/>&gt; any  different than if the composer or Cantor wished to portray the<br/>quarrel<br/>&gt; of the  hounds over the fallen body of Jesabel? (Haynes,<br/>dissertation, p. 257).</p><p>Yep, it was a big problem. Doesn&apos;t mean they didn&apos;t do it. Quite the<br/>opposite. There&apos;s quite a few more quotes in Bruce&apos;s book making this<br/>undeniable.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; By this  quote, it seems Mr. Haynes certainly see the other  side.</p><p>What other side? Nobody denies it was a BIG pain in the butt. Doesn&apos;t<br/>mean they didn&apos;t have to deal with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The  Krebs situation was likely in<br/>&gt; &gt; Werckmeister III.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  How do you know? Have you got some  evidence for the tuning<br/>of Kreb&apos;s<br/>&gt; organ when he wrote this piece?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Right now, I don&acirc;t know.  I don&acirc;t have the music in my<br/>hands and<br/>&gt; am functionally blind.  Besides,  your using the term cornettone<br/>when I had<br/>&gt; been using Chor or church pitch blurs  a bit.</p><p>There is no such thing as &quot;Church pitch&quot;. Churches used different<br/>pitches at different times. Chorton changed from 415-sih to 465-ish,<br/>so that term means nothing definite either. Only Cornetton/Trompetton<br/>stayed fixed at 465-ish.</p><p>  My assumption of Krebs  having<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III simply stems from WIII being the first published<br/>circular<br/>&gt; tuning in Bach&acirc;s neck of the woods, and Krebs is a name associated<br/>with  Bach.</p><p>My first computer was an Atari 800, with 2 kb of memory. I now have a<br/>MacBook, limping along on a mere 1 Gb. Krebs wasn&apos;t even born when<br/>Neidhardt published his first work, he was 11 when N published his<br/>second, and 19 when N published his 1732 treatise. Why would yo assume<br/>that Krebs would only use something so out of date as Werckmeister III?</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/23/2007 4:28:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, this is the wrap up!<br/>Paul: I consider his only valid temperament for 18th  century consideration<br/>to be that which he himself called &quot;How I tune&quot;, which  we now call<br/>KII. KIII did not become public until the 1880&apos;s. Not only that,  but<br/>KIII represents him grudgingly backing down on his principles  (read<br/>the letter to Forkel). Sort of undermines his whole shtick...</p><p>Johnny: Kirnberger had a very interesting coterie of  friends.  It seems<br/>reasonable to  assume that once Forkel knew, others would know.  It was likely<br/>passed through the  Mendellsohn family through Felix&rsquo;s mother and aunt.  Surely<br/>Beethoven could have said  something disparaging about Kirnberger while<br/>feverishly copying K&rsquo;s writings in  his own hand to look more impressive to his<br/>student(s).  What you consider is limited to a single  publication, and that is not<br/>the full picture.</p><p>&gt; While Kirnberger did say<br/>&gt; what he  said,</p><p>Paul:  I&apos;m glad to hear  that! For a moment, I thought the poor guy was<br/>possesed by evil spirits  forcing him to speak in tongues against his<br/>weill! But now that we have  established that Kirnberger said what he<br/>said, we are still left with the  issue of whether or not he actually<br/>said what *I* attributed to him, to wit:  ET can&apos;t be tuned without a<br/>monochord.</p><p>Johnny:  Who do you know in music in so mono-dimensionable?  Incidentally, he<br/>has his name attached  to an ET paper&mldr;but Marpurg attributes it to Moses<br/>Mendelssohn.  And many of Kirnberger&rsquo;s contributions  to various encyclopedias<br/>were signed by Sulzer, and others.  In other words, get off your high horse  and<br/>deal with KIII.  Rather than a  retreat from KII, it is also a retro return to<br/>WIII.  Checking the numbers, they are not that  different, but almost 100<br/>years apart&mldr;with JS Bach in between.</p><p>Paul:  Wow!!! So Kirnberger, all by his little old self, &quot;discovers&quot;  the<br/>schisma in 1766, and then further &quot;discovers&quot; that it is equal to  1/12<br/>of a P comma! Oooo! Cutting edge stuff indeed! What did he do for  an<br/>encore, &quot;discover&quot; the wheel? I mean, do you really think  this<br/>represented a &quot;discovery&quot; in 1766? If anything, it just proves to  me<br/>yet again how incompetent K was in this matter.</p><p>Johnny:  You sound like the people who condemn Al Gore, over the top.  You<br/>are way too critical.  Really, I don&rsquo;t even think tuning is a  category that<br/>deserves appendages like inferior and superior, let alone  incompetent.  Lou<br/>Harrison has  proved that Kirnberger II is not incompetent.  If you want to<br/>suggest that K stole his  ideas, please, proceed.  Otherwise,  you are blowing hot<br/>air.  There is  too much great music accomplished in this tuning.  Whether K,<br/>and W, etc. lived in a vacuum  in which no one paid attention, or they<br/>influenced everyone in their time in one  direction or another, it is more likely it<br/>was something in between.  Ibo studying every extant contract does  not inform<br/>on the majority of contracts that are not extant and tunings where no<br/>contract was every drawn up.</p><p>&gt; Another advantage of this method is<br/>&gt;  that it does not require a monochord.</p><p>Paul: Ahhhhh, how does that follow.  Yes, you can set this one fifth without<br/>a monchord, but how does one then  proceed to use it to finish the<br/>other 11 fifths? I suppose that having set up  the initial fifth you<br/>could try to go all the way back around the circle  doing the old 2:3<br/>beat rate shuffle, but the possiblity for cumulative error  doing a 2:3<br/>comparison for a chain of 11 fifths is pretty extreme.</p><p>Johnny: Me, with my inferior ear, has often tuned  keyboards &ldquo;melodically.&rdquo;<br/>Read an  interesting discussion by Jorgensen (Tuning) and a Handel tuning<br/>that was  performed by ear.  (I am not trying  to bring the authenticity of this<br/>Handelian well temperament into the  discussion&mldr;really.)  People will  tune<br/>differently.</p><p>Paul:  But of course, the main objection is this proves nothing, unless  there<br/>is missing text you neglected to quote. Did Kirnberger ever SAY  he<br/>uses this method to set ET on an instrument entirely by ear?<br/>Johnny: Kirnberger did not tune ET because he didn&rsquo;t  like it.  Do you need<br/>me to post his  vehement statements against ET?  Hence, the contrary<br/>statements.  He is discouraging others from tuning in ET by saying a monochord is<br/>required (while all the time passing on the trivia that it is indeed possible to  a<br/>foreign, only for it to get back to Marpurg under another&rsquo;s name).  Get it<br/>now?<br/>Paul: Uh, there you go again, making a mountain out  of molehill. If I had<br/>some wackadoodle theory about brain surgery, some brain  surgeon could<br/>well call me incompetent, which I am as a brain surgeon, and  I<br/>wouldn&apos;t see it as an attack on my intellect. Only on my knowledge  of<br/>brain surgery.<br/>Johnny:  Guess this is you being clear that my ideas are wackadoodle.  That&rsquo;s<br/>fine.  We&rsquo;ve covered enough after this  exchange.  I need to finish  editing.<br/> After the ideas are fully  fleshed out, if not flushed out, criticism will<br/>based on complete explanations,  and not e-mail postings which are always found<br/>wanting (as you have regularly  demonstrated).</p><p>Paul:  BTW, now that we are back on topic, what ever happened to  you<br/>providing some evidence that Beethoven expressed a preference for  K&apos;s<br/>temperament? Let alone the question of WHICH K temperament that  might<br/>have been...</p><p>Johnny: It is you that has divorced K&rsquo;s tuning from  his book.  K&rsquo;s tuning<br/>is throughout  the beginning of the book and throughout.  Who are you to cut it<br/>out from Beethoven&rsquo;s interest?  Regardless, the connection has not been  made<br/>explicitly.  Only, the music  works better in K tuning than it does in ET<br/>when the piano is involved.  Unless you know of something better, I  continue to<br/>recommend a K tuning.  KII worked beautifully for the Trio of piano, clarinet,<br/>and cello.  We have a nice recording.  Basically, it had to be something&mldr;.so<br/>why not K for B?</p><p>Paul: Ach, die Deutscher! Also irrelevant to the  discussion. Lots of things<br/>would surprise modern Germans, such as the fact  that &quot;schweben&quot; didn&apos;t<br/>mean &quot;beating&quot; for Neidhardt to name but one. So what?

You are the first  person I know of that has refuted the use<br/>of the term chor (church) pitch for  organ tuning a whole step higher than that<br/>of a kammer (chamber) pitch.  I&rsquo;m going to have redo the book to use  Paul<br/>Poletti terms.</p><p>My assumption of Krebs having<br/>&gt;  Werckmeister III simply stems from WIII being the first  published<br/>circular<br/>&gt; tuning in Bach&acirc;&euro;&trade;s neck of the woods, and Krebs is  a name associated<br/>with Bach.</p><p>Paul:  My first computer was an Atari 800, with  2 kb of memory.

I&rsquo;m not sure which Krebs you mean (did you ever give a first name?).<br/>There are several Krebs&rsquo;s.  As Leopold Mozart mentions  Werckmeister&rsquo;s tuning<br/>in his violin book, it was certainly still around, and I  maintain, used past<br/>the Baroque period.  While you doubt at every turn, it is you who may have<br/>actually been sold  a bill of goods.<br/>By 1681 W&rsquo;s tuning (WIII) was a new line in the  sand.  All 24 keys could be<br/>used.  The last 3 chapters of  Musical Temperament (1691) tell of the hell he<br/>received from a critic of his,  whose identity is anonymous.  It was  about a<br/>war between Werckmeister&rsquo;s III and his IV (Trost irregular  temperament).<br/>Fanciful ideas of alternatives to this fact of  W III&rsquo;s singularity leave no<br/>known  alternatives.  Neidhardt is too late  for the formative JS Bach, and<br/>the mature JS Bach.  Research, visiting the different cities,  studying<br/>everything pertinent, while experimenting publicly in NYC through  concerts, will<br/>yield a product.  You  may want to rip into it with the relish you reserve for<br/>your roast beef  sandwiches.

Not one single mention<br/>to my knowledge.</p><p>&gt;Really, I don&acirc;t even think tuning is a  category that<br/>&gt; deserves appendages like inferior and superior, let alone<br/>incompetent.  Lou<br/>&gt; Harrison has  proved that Kirnberger II is not incompetent.</p><p>You mix apples and oranges, Johnny. I think KII is an incompetent<br/>solution to the musical and practical challenges of the last quarter<br/>of the 18th century, for the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, CPE<br/>Bach, etc. Lou Harrison may well like the structure of KII, but once<br/>again, the likes/dislikes of a 20th c composer and/or musician have<br/>nothing to do with the 18th c. It&apos;s likes/dislikes of 18th century<br/>composers/musicians I&apos;m interested in.</p><p>&gt; If you want to<br/>&gt; suggest that K stole his  ideas, please, proceed.  Otherwise,  you<br/>are blowing hot<br/>&gt; air.</p><p>I don&apos;t know of any direct quote mentioning this factoid (schisma=1/12<br/>P comma), but both Neidhardt and Werckmeister had calculated the<br/>values for ET, though W failed to provide them, blaming an<br/>uncooperative engraver who balked at the precision required for ET,<br/>which is believable when you consider than Neidhardt chose NOT to<br/>offer a diagram but rather values on a scale of 1000 to 2000 and to<br/>the second decimal place no less. I would be extremely surprised if<br/>both men did not know what the schisma was and how big it was. In<br/>their presentation of their temperaments, both did conflate the two<br/>different commas in their numerical analysis of the tempering of<br/>thirds, simply adding up the total of P comma tempering over four<br/>adjacent fifths and pronouncing a cumulative tempering of one complete<br/>P comma as resulting in a &quot;pure&quot; third. The minute aberration created<br/>by so doing certainly has no relevance in a realistic musical setting,<br/>and a major third over-tempered by 1/12 P comma sounds every bit the<br/>pure third. I suspect they this did this merely to keep from getting<br/>bogged down in the schisma and confusing the reader. Ultimately one is<br/>only interested in relative third quality, not absolute, and since<br/>none of the temperaments they presented contained any chain of 4<br/>adjacent fifths with a total tempering of 12/12ths, playing fast and<br/>loose with the commas makes no real difference in that respect. I know<br/>that in my acoustics classes, I have the kids do it right, summing up<br/>the total tempering over four fifths and then subtracting it from 11<br/>instead of 12 to get the actual tempering. But it always confuses<br/>them, I have to explain it two or three times, and I know some of them<br/>never really get it - exactly the sort of confusion W &amp; N were wishing<br/>to avoid, I would guess.</p><p>All that aside, both W &amp; N were pretty sophisticated mathematically,<br/>both worked out their temperaments in decimal values for string<br/>lengths rather than just doing fractions, and Neidhardt even<br/>demonstrated the minute difference between a geometrical (log) and<br/>arithmetical (linear) division of the comma. I find it hard to believe<br/>that this level of sophistication would allow someone to be unaware<br/>that there is a difference between correcting for a pure third and<br/>correcting to close the circle, and that doing the former leaves over<br/>the last bit of doing the latter equally. But since this factoid it is<br/>of little or no practical value, there was no need to mention it. No<br/>practical value in tuning because simply establishing one correct<br/>fifth when there are still 11 more to do in exactly the same fashion<br/>is of little assistance. As far as calculating string lengths goes, it<br/>is much better to simply work it out, proceeding by successive<br/>division of the comma into halves, the halves into quarters, and<br/>finally the quarters into thirds, using the standard ancient geometric<br/>calculation techniques to derive the geometric means, or simply taking<br/>the arithmetic mean, at every step.</p><p>The critical question in the whole case is, how did Kirnberger know<br/>that the number he came up with was indeed exceedingly close to a<br/>1/12th P comma fifth? Did he work it out mathematically, or did he<br/>just do the division of his ratio derived from 3:2 to the 7th power<br/>times 5:4 plus the octave corrections, and then go look up that value<br/>in Neidhardt&apos;s table of ET values from the 1724 publication?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: Me, with my inferior ear, has often tuned  keyboards<br/>&acirc;melodically.&acirc;&#x9D;</p><p>I&apos;ll believe that when I hear it. If you can accurately tune an entire<br/>temperament MELODICALLY, than you are an absolute marvel, a dramatic<br/>exception to the rest of humanity, and should get yourself directly to<br/>the nearest acoustician to have your super-human capability documented<br/>before age sets in and your ability begins to erode, because in order<br/>to set tempeaments with any reasonable degree of accuracy, you are<br/>consistently functioning well below what is considered to be the JND.<br/>And standard JND test are of course just that, the smallest difference<br/>between two adjacent tones. I don&apos;t know if there are any JND test<br/>involving larger intervals, but I&apos;d bet the value gets worse.</p><p>BTW, after tuning these keyboards melodically, did you verify the<br/>tuning in any reliable way? Comparison to a set of electronically<br/>generated tones? Check it with a strobe? Beat rates? Or did you just<br/>assume that because it felt right, it was right?</p><p>&gt; Read an  interesting discussion by Jorgensen (Tuning) and a Handel<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; that was  performed by ear.</p><p>I&apos;ve read Jorgenson, and I don&apos;t believe his melodic tuning hypothesis<br/>has any substance whatsoever.  Neither does anybody who is steeped in<br/>the original literature, which talks about the beating an interval<br/>makes when you are tuning it when it is tempered and how it gets<br/>faster or slower depending upon the distance from purity of the interval.</p><p>I know that Jorgenson is very popular in the states, mostly among the<br/>modern piano tech crowd, and much less so among Early Music types. The<br/>general consensus here in Europe is that his work is seriously flawed<br/>due to a number of misinterpretations and failure to examine many<br/>important sources. This is not only my opinion, but that of the<br/>majority of temperament scholars enthusiasts (including Mark Lindley,<br/>who has said as much on the harpsichord list), who DO have a wider<br/>knowledge of the sources in a wide variety of languages.</p><p>&gt; People will  tune<br/>&gt; differently.</p><p>And with different degrees of accuracy.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  Did Kirnberger ever SAY  he<br/>&gt; uses this method to set ET on an instrument entirely by ear?<br/>&gt; Johnny: Kirnberger did not tune ET because he didn&acirc;t  like it.</p><p>Ah, so now you are saying he DIDN&apos;T tune ET. Again, try to stay on<br/>point, Johnny. We were discussing whether or not the man was CAPABLE,<br/>not what he liked to do. I don&apos;t like ET either, but I can tune it,<br/>and without a monchord, using a variety of historical and<br/>self-invented means, none of which require any knowledge and/or<br/>technology foreign to the 18th century.</p><p>&gt;  Do you need<br/>&gt; me to post his  vehement statements against ET?</p><p>Nope, I&apos;m well aware of his and others.</p><p>&gt; Paul: Uh, there you go again, making a mountain out  of molehill. If<br/>I had<br/>&gt; some wackadoodle theory about brain surgery, some brain  surgeon could<br/>&gt; well call me incompetent, which I am as a brain surgeon, and  I<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t see it as an attack on my intellect. Only on my knowledge  of<br/>&gt; brain surgery.<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Guess this is you being clear that my ideas are wackadoodle.</p><p>Uh, why do you think this was directed at you when we were talking<br/>about Kirnberger? It&apos;s Kirnberger who had wacadoodle ideas about how<br/>to make a temperament which was well-suited for the music of the late<br/>18th century. I will grant that one possibility is that Kirnberger did<br/>NOT intend his temperament to have wide application to the music being<br/>written by others at the time, that he only wanted to invent a new<br/>complete integrated system of temperament AND composition, and that<br/>only HIS music works well in his temperament. That is quite credible.<br/>If so, then it argues against applying it generally to other composers<br/>music, unless they are post-K and their music can be demonstrated to<br/>exhibit whatever principles of composition K was expounding in his thesis.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  There  is no such thing as &quot;Church pitch&quot;. Churches used<br/>different<br/>&gt; pitches at  different times.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Wow.  You are the first  person I know of that has refuted<br/>the use<br/>&gt; of the term chor (church) pitch for  organ tuning a whole step<br/>higher than that<br/>&gt; of a kammer (chamber) pitch.  I&acirc;m going to have redo the book to<br/>use  Paul<br/>&gt; Poletti terms.</p><p>These are not &quot;Poletti&quot; terms, it is just correct translation of the<br/>German words. Chor=&quot;choir&quot;, not &quot;church&quot;. As far as I know, no<br/>original source uses any term which can be translated as &quot;church<br/>pitch&quot;. Grant, Choir Pitch, which was sometimes higher and sometimes<br/>lower by a whole tone than Chamber Pitch, is usually that pitch which<br/>was used in the church, but most people I know who choose to translate<br/>it all (Haynes chooses not to) do so correctly. I have seen<br/>exceptions, but I see no need for *intentionally* confusing the issue.<br/>Look at all the grief that the mistranslation of &quot;schweben&quot; has<br/>caused, creating an entire fantasy world of &quot;historical&quot; equal-beating<br/>(literally) temperaments. It&apos;s this misinterpretation which underlies<br/>Jorgenson&apos;s most ridiculous claim, that 1/4 S comma meantone was<br/>impossible before modern times because everybody thought that equal<br/>beating meant equally-tempered, and so they tempered all their fifths<br/>to beat the same.</p><p>&gt;  I&acirc;m not sure which Krebs you mean (did you ever give a first<br/>name?).<br/>&gt; There are several Krebs&acirc;s.</p><p>Johann Ludwig Krebs, 1713-1780</p><p>&gt;  As Leopold Mozart mentions  Werckmeister&acirc;s tuning<br/>&gt; in his violin book, it was certainly still around, and I  maintain,<br/>used past<br/>&gt; the Baroque period.</p><p>Leopold does not mention Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;tuning&quot; (by this I assume you<br/>mean his temperament, the one we call WIII). He only refers to<br/>Werckmeister in a list of masters who have written extensively on the<br/>topic of temperament which the reader should consult to gain further<br/>understanding:</p><p>&quot;Now that the divided keys on the organ are abolished, if one tuned<br/>everything in pure fifths, then with the progression of remaining<br/>notes, there would arise an intolerable dissonance. They must<br/>therefore be tempered. That is, one has to take something from the one<br/>consonance and add something to the other. They must be so distributed<br/>and the notes so balanced with each other that they are all tolerable<br/>to the ear. And this is called Tempered Tuning. It would be too wide a<br/>subject to cite here all the mathematical researches of many learned<br/>men. Read Sauver, B&uuml;mler, Henfling, Werckmeister, and Neidhardt.&quot;<br/>(footnote 2 to I-III-25, trans. Knocker)</p><p>Need I point out the last fellow on the list?

All 24<br/>keys could be<br/>&gt; used.  The last 3 chapters of  Musical Temperament (1691) tell of<br/>the hell he<br/>&gt; received from a critic of his,  whose identity is anonymous.  It was<br/> about a<br/>&gt; war between Werckmeister&acirc;s III and his IV (Trost irregular<br/>temperament).<br/>&gt; Fanciful ideas of alternatives to this fact of  W III&acirc;s<br/>singularity leave no<br/>&gt; known  alternatives.</p><p>Ah, beg pardon, but Werckmeister V is quite similar to WIII, except<br/>the good thirds are not as good. But you can play in all 24 keys no prob.</p><p>&gt; Neidhardt is too late  for the formative JS Bach, and<br/>&gt; the mature JS Bach.</p><p>...and the mature JS Bach what? Certainly one cannot argue that<br/>Neidhardt&apos;s publications are &quot;too late&quot; chronologically for the mature<br/>JS Bach, so there must some thought that completes the sentence in a<br/>hypothetically credible though possibly debatable manner. Suggestions:<br/>The mature JS Bah was a conservative fuddy-duddy so set in his ways<br/>that he never grew beyond what he had learned in his youth. Or: The<br/>mature JS Bach was a reclusive who never read any contemporary<br/>literature on music or organ construction. Or: The mature JS Bach,<br/>living behind the Iron Curtain as he did in East Germany, could not<br/>get ahold of anything published in the West.</p><p>&gt;  Research, visiting the different cities,  studying<br/>&gt; everything pertinent, while experimenting publicly in NYC through<br/>concerts, will<br/>&gt; yield a product.</p><p>Undoubtedly, but what sort of product?</p><p>&gt; You  may want to rip into it with the relish you reserve for<br/>&gt; your roast beef  sandwiches.</p><p>Roast lamb. Don&apos;t care for roast beef, and it wasn&apos;t a sandwich, but<br/>rather a full hot meal with potatos and gravy.</p><p>&gt;  I hope that other  readers will be more open<br/>&gt; minded.</p><p>I will be plenty open minded, I just hope your final arguments are<br/>better thought out and better documented than what you have so far<br/>presented here. Believe me, if you can make a convincing argument for<br/>JSB liking/using WIII, I&apos;ll be the first to recommend your work as<br/>offering a credible resolution to one of the most intriguing questions<br/>regarding historical temperament practice. Ditto Beethoven and<br/>Kirnberger. So far, however, it has been little more than wishful<br/>thinking, vague insinuations, questionable conclusions, and subjective<br/>judgments by you and other moderns.</p><p>In any event, do let me know when your book is available.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/24/2007 1:36:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul: I agree completely that it is  not outside the realm of possibility,<br/>though it is very strange that with all  the press Kirnberger got,<br/>there is no mention in later texts of the &quot;new and  improved&quot; version<br/>of the controversial Kirnberger tuning, which resolves the  problem of<br/>the two ugly fifths in important natural keys. Not one single  mention<br/>to my knowledge.</p><p>Johnny:  Kirnberger died in 1683.  People were not so generous to advertise<br/>a dead man&rsquo;s tuning innovation.  Forkel likely spread the word to the extended<br/>Bach circle.</p><p>Johnny:  In the sense that Kirnberger insisted as  early as KI to have at<br/>least one just 386 cent major third in the key of C, and  throughout two later<br/>innovations, he was innovative.  Notice, I trace the derivation of KIII  from<br/>KII, in which case KII is less incompetent and more pioneering.  On this list we<br/>support  pioneers.<br/>Paul:  I don&apos;t know of any direct quote  mentioning this factoid (schisma=1/12<br/>P comma), but both Neidhardt and  Werckmeister had calculated the<br/>values for ET, though W failed to provide  them, blaming an<br/>uncooperative engraver who balked at the precision required  for ET,<br/>which is believable when you consider than Neidhardt chose NOT  to<br/>offer a diagram but rather values on a scale of 1000 to 2000 and to<br/>the  second decimal place no less.<br/>Johnny:  Kirnberger has nothing to prove  regarding his intelligence, math or<br/>otherwise.  He is not a tuner in the sense you  wished him to be.  I don&rsquo;t<br/>know who  he might represent to you, but his numbers do add up.  The apochryphal<br/>story reported by Mark  Lindley, if true, is sarcastic at best.  Reading<br/>Werckmeister is an intensely personal experience.  He&rsquo;s outright paranoid at<br/>times.   Werckmeister is always looking  over his soldier for the next lobbed<br/>criticism.  Throughout W&rsquo;s entire life he preferred  that his diatonic major thirds<br/>were more just than others.  The very tuning of WIII was his solution  to<br/>present day tuning.  W.  definitely wanted to influence everyone to 24 major and<br/>minor keys,  unequal.  Any fair reading of W&rsquo;s  work indicates that WIII is<br/>the basis of Musicalische Temperatur.  WIV is the old Trost tuning with its 2<br/>dogs.  WV is more ET than WIII, but  not, but with a 690 and a 708 fifths.  I<br/>think the variegation was important to W as it was to those that  favored WIV<br/>(Trost, Thayssner).  There isn&rsquo;t even a half page about WV in Musicalische<br/>Temperatur.  And VI, I haven&rsquo;t ever heard of a piece  of music in WVI.<br/>Paul:  The critical question in the whole case  is, how did Kirnberger know<br/>that the number he came up with was indeed  exceedingly close to a<br/>1/12th P comma fifth? Did he work it out  mathematically, or did he<br/>just do the division of his ratio derived from 3:2  to the 7th power<br/>times 5:4 plus the octave corrections, and then go look up  that value<br/>in Neidhardt&apos;s table of ET values from the 1724 publication?</p><p>Johnny:  See, that&rsquo;s not critical to me.  I couldn&rsquo;t care less.  However, I<br/>see you want to know if  Kirnberger was a thief, partly due to his mental<br/>retardation.  ;)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: Me, with my  inferior ear, has often tuned keyboards<br/>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;melodically.&acirc;&euro;&#x9D;</p><p>Paul:  I&apos;ll believe that when I hear it. If you  can accurately tune an entire<br/>temperament MELODICALLY, than you are an  absolute marvel, blah, blah, blah,</p><p>Johnny:  My life has been an open book.  You pretty much come off like I<br/>should  submit to experimentation in a lab, maybe with needles and electric<br/>shocks!  Please, no rendition.  Instead, please attempt to recognize I  am coming<br/>from a different direction than you are.  It may well be our hemispheres are<br/>reversed, for example.  Also, do you  sing?  Play a flexible pitched  instrument<br/>for early music performance?  For now we should at least take each other as<br/>it is said, without sarcasm  if at possible (and less it is really obvious).<br/>&gt; Read an interesting discussion  by Jorgensen (Tuning) and a Handel<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; that was performed by  ear.</p><p>Paul:  I&apos;ve read  Jorgenson, and I don&apos;t believe his melodic tuning hypothesis<br/>has any  substance whatsoever. Neither does anybody who is steeped in<br/>the original  literature, which talks about the beating an interval<br/>makes when you are  tuning it when it is tempered and how it gets<br/>faster or slower depending upon  the distance from purity of the interval.</p><p>Johnny:  Call me a liar.  I don&rsquo;t tune by counting beats, and it  is the<br/>basis of the AFMM.<br/>Paul: I know that Jorgenson is very  popular in the states, mostly among the<br/>modern piano tech crowd, and much  less so among Early Music types. The<br/>general consensus here in Europe is that his work is seriously flawed<br/>due to a  number of misinterpretations and failure to examine many<br/>important sources.  This is not only my opinion, but that of the<br/>majority of temperament scholars  enthusiasts (including Mark Lindley,<br/>who has said as much on the harpsichord  list), who DO have a wider<br/>knowledge of the sources in a wide variety of  languages.<br/>Johnny: I agree about Jorgenson,  about several different matters.  But I am<br/>talking to you now, not Jorgenson.  It is Mark Lindley who gave me my<br/>translation of W&rsquo;s Musical Temperament (Hehr).  I helped him with his PhD at Columbia<br/>University by informing the professors on  the committee as to his<br/>importance, often translating his ideas for them.  I am most supportive of him and his<br/>eminent career.  But he is not the  final answer to any question that I am<br/>raising.</p><p>&gt; Johnny: Kirnberger  did not tune ET because he didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like it.</p><p>Ah, so now you are saying he  DIDN&apos;T tune ET. Again, try to stay on<br/>point, Johnny. We were discussing  whether or not the man was CAPABLE,<br/>not what he liked to do.<br/>Johnny:  Yes, his calculations and commentary  demonstrate he was capable of<br/>tuning ET.  No, didn&rsquo;t do it often because he didn&rsquo;t like it.  But what does<br/>this matter?  Stay on point?  Why does Kirnberger have to prove to  you,<br/>hundreds of years later, that he had mojo to a keyboard builder and  tuner?<br/>History owes him so very  much.  And you started off by  slandering him, now just<br/>trying to land as gently as possible.  Paul, you have no business being part of<br/>the destruction of a personage such as Kirnberger.  Go after someone meaner,<br/>like Rameau  (the skinflint).<br/>Paul:  I don&apos;t like ET either, but I can tune  it,<br/>and without a monchord, using a variety of historical  and<br/>self-invented means, none of which require any knowledge  and/or<br/>technology foreign to the 18th century.</p><p>Johnny: I shall accept you at your  word.  &mldr;</p><p>Paul: Uh, why do you  think this was directed at you when we were talking<br/>about Kirnberger?

KIII has wider<br/>applications because it was around long enough for other people to write in  it.  D&rsquo;oh,<br/>when KII was published  there were no other composers composing in it.  So,<br/>only K composed in KII, unless  someone was influenced by the book.  KIII,<br/>another story.</p><p>Paul:  These are not &quot;Poletti&quot; terms, it is  just correct translation of the<br/>German words. Chor=&quot;choir&quot;, not &quot;church&quot;.

There  would be no point to even<br/>mention Werckmeister by name if he didn&rsquo;t have a  circular well temperament<br/>ideal for Mozart&rsquo;s music.<br/>According to Michiyo Uchida,  compiled in Notes by Edward Seckerson (Hi-Fi<br/>News and Record<br/>Review, august  1984). Mozart specialist Uchida wrote:<br/>&ldquo;Actually, the tuning we have used  is slightly different to the usual.  We<br/>experimented with meantone,  Werckmeister,  and equal  temperament, and I chose<br/>Werckmeister for Mozart.  (I&rsquo;ve even played a Brahms concerto with  it and<br/>none of the orchestral players noticed!)  It is quite playable in most keys,<br/>actually, and when it is distorted, as it must be, it is in the keys that you<br/>need that distortion.  It was rather  interesting with the B-minor Adagio.  The<br/>ending of this is a magical change to B-major, and to have it as  different,<br/>as remote as possible from the minor is difficult to manage unless  you are in<br/>absolute top form.  It&rsquo;s  particularly difficult in the recording studio at<br/>the end of a tiring day.

There is also the matter of variegation;<br/>except for the dogs, WIII keeps hold of the perceivable distinctiveness of key<br/> character better.  I believe there  is evidence that W preferred the variety<br/>of keys.  One of W&rsquo;s sons continued to perform in  WIV, an irregular tuning<br/>that was not a well temperament.<br/>&gt; Neidhardt is too late for the  formative JS Bach, and<br/>&gt; the mature JS Bach.</p><p>Paul:...and the mature  JS Bach what?

I think the way cousin Walther treats<br/>Werckmeister in his Lexicon trumps his treatment of Neidhardt, who is  included.  While<br/>I have no problems  whatsoever with Mr. Neidhardt, I point out that he was<br/>not a Thuringian which in  relative in that all those in favor of non-ET were<br/>indeed Thuringians, and I  would include the Bachs, who were more of a guild, if<br/>not a phenomenon, than  just a family of composers.</p><p>&gt; I hope that other readers  will be more open<br/>&gt; minded.</p><p>Paul:  I will be plenty open minded, I just  hope your final arguments are<br/>better thought out and better documented than  what you have so far<br/>presented here&mldr;.<br/>Johnny:  I think I have piqued your  interest.  The rest is to  follow.<br/>There is more, Horatio,  than you are yet aware (to paraphrase).  Sometimes a<br/>tempered interval is meant as a tempered interval, even an  exact one.

I&apos;m curious what hard evidence you<br/>have that anyone in &quot;the extended Bach circle&quot; knew about or used his<br/>irregular C-G-D-A-E scheme.</p><p>And if you&apos;re looking for fine coverage of the reception history on<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s work, way beyond his death getting cited in publications<br/>by encyclopedists, read Rita Steblin&apos;s book.  She gave it a whole<br/>chapter.  As Paul correctly pointed out, it&apos;s all about the scheme<br/>with two 1/2 comma 5ths, not the one where he distributed the comma<br/>irregularly among C-G-D-A-E.</p><p>Sure, the Kirnberger scheme with two 1/2 comma 5ths sounds fine in Lou<br/>Harrison&apos;s piano concerto; Harrison composed it explicitly for that,<br/>and restrained his orchestration to be only strings, trombones, two<br/>harps, and percussion.  I remember reading somewhere years ago (and<br/>not in the CD booklet notes) that the string players weren&apos;t terribly<br/>happy with the phenomenon of 1/2 comma D-A-E 5ths downtown on their<br/>open strings.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a modern advocate of that Kirnberger<br/>temperament, ask Miklos Spanyi.  He told me he has an especially<br/>careful and tasteful way of doing it that comes out sounding better. I<br/>went myself and experimented with it for a while, presuming that<br/>Spanyi&apos;s scheme (he didn&apos;t give me details) is to fringe some or all<br/>of the &quot;pure&quot; 5ths by some little imperceptible amount, in the<br/>direction that not so much of the comma will be left over for D-A-E.<br/>And it sort of works, if that&apos;s what Spanyi is doing...but it&apos;s not<br/>evidence that anybody 18th or early 19th century was doing any<br/>similarly subtle refinement of such cheater 5ths.
