&gt; slides, tonal modulations, heterophonic group singing, etc.<br/>to &apos;raw&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; MIDI files built straight from notation and present this as<br/>&gt; &gt; illuminating material about this music.<br/>&gt;

One may venture to presume that even the<br/>&gt; simplest pentatonical scales from the this region came to resemble Maqams in<br/>&gt; time due to the inter-continental influence of the Islamic Civilization.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is safe to consider all of North Africa to belong to the Maqam Music<br/>&gt; family, from Morocco to Ethiopia.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz.</p><p>I would certainly not affirm that last statement for all Ethiopians.  In Ethiopia, Eritrea, and parts of Sudan, the classical lyric and epic accompanied song traditions are part of a continuum that predates any Maqam genre by a least a millenium.  The tonal practice and the structure of the texts is quite unlike anything associated with Maqam musics. The principle classical instruments, lyres and bows harps, are still used in forms close to those of the lyres (begena, krar) and bow harps of the ancient Nile valley as well as the large and small lyres of the classical Greek world.  (Construction and playing techniques used in Ethiopia and Eritrea are often staggeringly close to those described in Greek and Hellenistic documents and observed in artifacts). In addition, there is the Orthodox Tewahedo Church music, which while sharing some liturgical-formal features with (Egyptian) Coptic Church music bears many distinctions from the Copts, in tonal practice and instrumental accompaniment. (The influence of old Jewish music in Tewahedo practice appears large; this is in keeping with the general tendency of the Tewahedo to focus more on practices associated with the old testament than either Catholics or Orthodox do).</p><p>I have no doubt that Maqam musics share some common ancestry with these traditions, but that does not make them genres of Maqam, and given the apparent continuity in these traditions, I would tend to hear the Ethiopic as representing perhaps the healthiest surviver of the stem tradition, and locate both Maqam and post-Roman musics in branches of that stem (albeit branches receiving some important grafts from other cultures as well). There are abundant examples of the Greeks citing influence from Egypt and much evidence in Egypt points in turn to an active exchange with Africa. (The influence of Africa has not always been understated: in the 3rd century C.E.: Mani considered Aksum (Ethiopia), Rome, Persia, and China to be the four great powers of his time).  The evidence is scarce but it is attractive to consider the four pentatonic Kignit of krar (lyre) tunings to be the trichordal ancestors of the classical greek tetrachordal tunings (which of course would have fallen precisely into the famous missing chapter of Boethius, on the division of the fourth into two parts).

Thurlow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lieurance&apos;s By the Waters of Minnetonka was the product his<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interest in collecting and preserving Indian music, and was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a riff on a Sioux love song he recorded in 1911 on the Crow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reservation in Montana.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene, do you have any more info on this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fillmore, John Comfort. A Study of Indian Music.<br/>&gt; &gt; The Century. 02.1894<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/q7mre">http://tinyurl.com/q7mre</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a great find, Clark!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I soon found that the piano, with the audible thud of its<br/>&gt; hammer, its inability to produce intervals smaller than a<br/>&gt; semitone, its fixity of pitch, and its tempered tuning, was<br/>&gt; as unsatisfactory to the Indian as his singing can be to<br/>&gt; our unaccustomed ears.&quot;</p><p>Hi Carl and others,</p><p>The Fillmore article refers to an article called<br/>&quot;Indian Songs&quot; by Alice C Fletcher in the previous<br/>issue (Jan 1894) of The Century.</p><p>The link is this:<br/><a href="http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABP2287-0047-110">http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABP2287-0047-110</a></p><p>Fletcher was an anthropologist and ethnologist<br/>with no mean understanding of music.  The article<br/>describes how she spent time with, and was cared<br/>for by, the Omaha.  It gives a much fuller picture<br/>than I&apos;ve seen before in near-contemporary accounts<br/>(she&apos;s writing about roughly 1884) of the place and<br/>roles of music in Omaha life.  The article also includes<br/>a couple more songs transcribed by her and arranged<br/>by Fillmore.</p><p>A search on the Cornell Library &quot;Making of America&quot;<br/>site turned up a total of 10 references to Alice C<br/>Fletcher in The Century.  I&apos;ve got some more reading<br/>to do ...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.375 / Virus Database: 268.1.1/272 - Release Date: 1/3/06</p></div>
