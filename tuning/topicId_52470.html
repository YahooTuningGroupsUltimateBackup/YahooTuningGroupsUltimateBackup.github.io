So I guess if you need something really quickly I<br/>probably can&apos;t help.  (Unless of course you want to hire me to write some<br/>code for you.  ;)</p><p>Meanwhile this is a great list for discussion of anything microtonal and no<br/>doubt many of us would be interested in knowing more about what you are<br/>doing, from the musical perspective and even from the business perspective.<br/>I was the one who referred you to this list, and I was really hoping you<br/>would share some of this here.  You are also likely to get a lot of input<br/>here that may influence your design, if you want that.  There are some<br/>developers here but not that many, and sorry if I gave you the wrong<br/>impression in inviting you here.</p><p>I wonder if the Making Microtonal Music list has more developers.  Jon?<br/>Anyway you might also check out:</p><p>    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic</a></p><p>Thanks,<br/>Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3><a id=52497 href="#52497">ðŸ”—</a>Philip &#x3C;philippe.gruchet@free.fr&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2004 5:28:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>I&apos;m looking for a scheme as source code to include in a virtual instrument to handle<br/>external user tune tables, such Scala files format (.scl).</p><p>&gt;Meanwhile this is a great list for discussion of anything microtonal and no doubt<br/>&gt;many of us would be interested in knowing more about what you are doing, from<br/>&gt;the musical perspective and even from the business perspective.</p><p> I wish to promote microtuning abilities in musical software (all platforms) by sharing<br/>a &apos;ready-to-implement source code&apos;.
