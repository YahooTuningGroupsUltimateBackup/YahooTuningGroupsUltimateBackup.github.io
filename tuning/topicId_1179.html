My approach has been to find a way to tune<br/>&gt;the partials to small number ratios in the series.</p><p>I&apos;ve found two interesting uses of bar-timbre scales. First, you can<br/>use the dissonance curve for the bar spectrum directly - this gives you<br/>a non-octave based scale that is quite distinct sounding.<br/>The other idea is to combine the bar-timbre with a harmonic timbre<br/>(as occurs for instance in the gender, vibes, and other xylophone-like<br/>instruments when played along with harmonic instruments).<br/>As I show in appendix I of TTSS, this combination gives a scale<br/>very close to a 7-tet scale.</p><p>I first discovered this when studying the Thai classical music,<br/>which is in (approximately) and is played on xylophone-like<br/>instruments called the renat.</p></div>
