They are limited in the MIDI note no.s<br/>they respond to.</p><p>-------------<br/>I was peeking at the reference PDF for the K2600 &amp; noticed this :</p><p>&quot;You can assign samples to keymaps in the range from C 0 to G 9.<br/> The K2600 will respond to MIDI events in the octave from C -1 to B -1.<br/> If a Note On event is generated in the range from C - 1 to B -1,<br/> the K2600 will respond by setting the Intonation key correspondingly<br/> (C -1 will set it to C, C # -1 will set it to C # , etc.)&quot;</p><p>So, does this mean you cannot have a 128-note piano program, i.e. one that<br/>plays a different pitch on ea. of the 128 MIDI note numbers ?<br/>-------------<br/>&gt; There is no such thing as a 128 notes piano.<br/>Perhaps not, but that&apos;s not my point. I just wanted to know if it&apos;s possible<br/>to use all 128 note no.s for an instrument in the K2xxx series.</p><p>My real reason for asking is that if I were to use it microtonally in,<br/>perhaps, 41-tone equal temperament, it would take 123 notes for a range of<br/>just 3 octaves, or 124 notes for 4 octaves of 31-tET.<br/>-------------<br/>Until I read that bit in the Kurz manual, I never knew such a limitation<br/>even existed in ANY synth/sampler.</p><p>It occured to me that there may be more out there that did not respond to<br/>all 128 notes. Damn. I now know of more that are funny that way :</p><p>Ensoniq ASR-X Pro &amp; E-mu ESI2000 -<br/>    Note No.s recognized : 21-108 (A-1 thru C7)<br/>That&apos;s ONLY 76 keyz ! Shiiiiit...</p><p>K2600 : 0 - 127, BUT : 0-11 sets intonation key</p><p>-------------<br/>Just checked, the E-mu E series (E4, E5000, etc.) responds to all notes,<br/>0 to 127. Neat.</p><p>I think the Akai S5000 &amp; S6000 are also limited to no.s 21 to 127.<br/>-------------<br/>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Bid and sell for free at <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.com">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
