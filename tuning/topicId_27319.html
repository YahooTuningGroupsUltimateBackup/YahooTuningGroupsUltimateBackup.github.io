Only the LH second hole is covered on the instrument.  Between these<br/>2 notes is an interval of just under 2 cents.</p><p>Play this fingering between the 2 already identified for an even division of<br/>just under a cent:  0 0 X  X 0 X (no thumb)</p><p>To continue descending by single cents play the following fingerings:</p><p>0 0 X  X</p><p>0 0 X  X 0 X</p><p>0 X</p><p>0 X 0  0 0 0 half</p><p>0 X 0  0 0 half half</p><p>0 X 0  0 0 0 X</p><p>0 X 0  0 0 X</p><p>And it continues.  It is important not to waver the breath.  Try not to think<br/>about tuning and just blow evenly.  There may be a slight timbre change<br/>between the top 2 notes and the second hole G series.  Most professionals<br/>color this &quot;normal&quot; G with the following:  0 X 0 0 0 half</p><p>I can improve its color and still get the pitch where it needs be.</p><p>Most people I have demonstrated this to in person hear the motion, but are<br/>unsure of the direction!  When I play the first note just before the second<br/>note, then they hear the 8-cent spread and marvel.   Slightly tongue each<br/>note so there is full definition in the change of pitch.</p><p>Good adventures!</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
