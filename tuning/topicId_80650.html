If you listen to pieces like &quot;New York Counterpoint&quot;, &quot;Sextet&quot;, or &quot;Three Movements&quot; (and some other pieces to a smaller extent as well), you&apos;ll find that their last movements all have something in common. This is what I tried to mail down in the Midi file I&apos;ve uploaded to the &quot;PP tuning stuff&quot; folder here (although this is actually 12-equal :-D).</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=80651 href="#80651">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2009 10:29:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That should have read &quot;what I was trying to nail down&quot;, of course.</p><p>PP</p></div>
