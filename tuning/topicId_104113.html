An interesting possibility might be to use a period of 4/1 rather than 2/1, which would make 7/4 impossible but 2:3:7 would still be playable. And the MOSs would go in the same way as orwell MOSs go in the standard 2/1-periodic world -- no wonder, the generator is twice that of orwell.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=104121 href="#104121">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2012 1:36:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, since no 5-limit temperament of such small error is as easily<br/>&gt; reachable as this 7-limit one,</p><p>Hell, I was wrong again ...
