For Scarlatti, it has some<br/>very nice midi performances of all 555 sonatas, in zipped format.<br/>About the tuning of this, the performer/sequencer, John Sankey, has<br/>this to say:</p><p>A twelve-note scale can not have all intervals in tune at the</p><p>same time. MIDI systems default to equal tempering, where only</p><p>octaves are really in tune. This tuning was not musically</p><p>acceptable to keyboard musicians of Scarlatti&apos;s time, who</p><p>restricted the keys they played in so that more of the</p><p>musically-important intervals could be in tune. They also</p><p>valued the variety of characters that differing keys have when</p><p>all intervals are not equal. I used a technique of consonance</p><p>analysis (W.A.Sethares, Journal of the Acoustical Society of</p><p>America 96:10, 1994) to aid me in finding the systems of</p><p>tuning that Scarlatti probably used most commonly, since no</p><p>records of it survive other than the music itself. These</p><p>recordings use the best tuning I have found, one published by</p><p>d&apos;Alembert in 1752 and refined for these sonatas by the</p><p>consonance technique.</p><p>On the Pachelbel Magnificat page,</p><p><a href="http://www.kunstderfuge.com/pachelbelmagnificat.htm">http://www.kunstderfuge.com/pachelbelmagnificat.htm</a></p><p>we find tunings in various temperaments, and an explanation of how to<br/>use Scala to do it.</p></div>
