Some of the people behind ZIPI were Keith McMillen of<br/>&gt;Zeta Music / Gibson (their address back then was 2560 Ninth St.,<br/>&gt;Suite 212 in Berkeley), and David L. Wessel &amp; Matthew Wright,<br/>&gt;both of CNMAT, (CNMAT&apos;s address back then was 1750 Arch St.,<br/>&gt;Berkeley).  The Computer Music Journal devoted a lot of ink to<br/>&gt;ZIPI in their Winter 1994 issue (I still have a copy).  I made a<br/>&gt;few phone calls approx. six years ago and was informed that ZIPI<br/>&gt;is dead.  If I remember correctly, there was some intellectual<br/>&gt;property ownership dispute (don&apos;t ask me to elaborate because I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t remember) and ZIPI was killed in the cross-fire.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s funny that you mention this because I have been doing a<br/>&gt;teensy bit of research just this past week and I have the<br/>&gt;feeling that USB midi is starting to supplant midi as we speak.<br/>&gt;It&apos;s popping up more and more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here&apos;s a message I sent one week ago to Paul Berg--the &quot;point<br/>&gt;man&quot; for the USB midi spec and his response:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;At 06:11 PM 7/10/2003, Paul Vandervoort wrote:<br/>&gt;Hello-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am developing a musical keyboard product.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have a few questions regarding this document:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/midi10.pdf">http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/midi10.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is this the latest version of the protocol?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Will this protocol work with USB II?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is this protocol in widespread use?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thank you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sincerely,<br/>&gt;Paul Vandervoort<br/>&gt;Daskin Keyboard Co.<br/>&gt;Reno, NV<br/>&gt;----------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hello,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, the current version of  the &quot;Universal Serial Bus Device<br/>&gt;Class Definition for MIDI Devices&quot; document is 1.0 from November<br/>&gt;1999, and yes, IMHO it is fully applicable to the current USB<br/>&gt;2.0 specification (available at<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20.zip">http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20.zip</a>).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To my knowledge this specification describes the design of most<br/>&gt;if not all currently available USB-to-MIDI devices, but as far<br/>&gt;as I can tell neither Microsoft (Windows XP and 2000 and 9x<br/>&gt;versions) or Apple (Mac OS X and OS9) have developed standard<br/>&gt;drivers for devices that implement the MIDI Streaming class.  In<br/>&gt;my experience this is related to how common the product is<br/>&gt;relative to the number of OS installations -- I suspect that<br/>&gt;USB-to-MIDI is used in only a very small share of the Windows<br/>&gt;and Mac installations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It would appear that regardless of your design you will have to<br/>&gt;develop and ship your own drivers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Still, there would very likely be an advantage in following the<br/>&gt;class specification as it may very well have anticipated issues<br/>&gt;and provided solutions or ways to avoid problems that might not<br/>&gt;be obvious when first considering the design of a USB MIDI<br/>&gt;transport.  Certainly at the very least you should fully<br/>&gt;investigate this class specification before you decide to build<br/>&gt;your device in a different way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would point out that the class specification uses USB bulk<br/>&gt;transfers -- these provide the highest bandwidth on an otherwise<br/>&gt;unused bus and scale very well from full-speed to high-speed<br/>&gt;designs (as per the success of USB Mass Storage in taking a<br/>&gt;class that was designed to use full-speed bulk transport and<br/>&gt;using the class drivers without change to support high-speed<br/>&gt;devices).<br/>&gt;But using bulk transfers means that you can&apos;t run multiple USB<br/>&gt;devices such as standard keyboard, mouse or video camera on the<br/>&gt;same USB host controller without impacting the MIDI throughput.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Further, please note that if you do not fully implement the MIDI<br/>&gt;Streaming class as described in this specification your device,<br/>&gt;even though it offers an interface to a MIDI instrument, is NOT<br/>&gt;a USB Audio class device.  If you chose to implement your own<br/>&gt;interface design you must use 0xFF as your class code.  This<br/>&gt;will avoid significant problems in the field if any of the major<br/>&gt;OS providers should ever release a driver for the standard class.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--best regards and good luck with your project<br/>&gt;   Paul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Paul E.
