If you feel you need to be constrained to a keyboard, you&apos;ll<br/>find more than you thought. First off, I really enjoy a short sonata<br/>movement by list member Chris Bailey in that was retuned to 7 limit<br/>just intonation by a former list member. Find the file at:</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/sonata.7lim.mp3">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/sonata.7lim.mp3</a></p><p>for an idea of what can be done. Also, while not a lot of his stuff<br/>really does it for me, Jeff Harrington has quite a bit of keyboard<br/>work for differing intonations. I mention him because he seems to come<br/>from a keyboard orientation (rather than an orchestral composer using<br/>a keyboard to get the work done; if I&apos;m way off base on JH, someone<br/>can let me know). He seems to be very adept at self promotion, so<br/>either do a Google search or ask around; I&apos;m pretty sure he has a<br/>bunch of stuff on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> and other sound areas, and may have his own<br/>web site. Again, not always my cup of tea, but it isn&apos;t just dicking<br/>around on a keyboard either.</p><p>Lastly and most importantly, how about music from one of the giants of<br/>the last hundred years who just left us? Lou Harrison? (I&apos;m reposting<br/>the next bit, which I posted just a week ago - read the list<br/>carefully!)</p><p>-----------------</p><p>I came across a review of a recent recording of keyboard works of Lou</p><p>Harrison on <a href="http://andante.com">andante.com</a> - you can read the review (and there is a nice</p><p>interview with Lou in the latest main pages) here:</p><p><a href="http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=19715">http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=19715</a></p><p>What struck me, vis a vis recent threads, was the last paragraph:</p><p>&quot;The most fascinating work here is 1957&apos;s Music for Corneille&apos;s Cinna,<br/>the recording of which occasioned a controversy in microtonal music<br/>circles. Burman-Hall first recorded it on a proper tack piano Â— but in<br/>the wrong tuning; after some discussion among pianist, composer,<br/>record company and others, she re-recorded it in Harrison&apos;s specified<br/>seven-limit just intonation. The tuning matters because this landmark<br/>of microtonal experimentation represents one of Harrison&apos;s most<br/>successful responses to Partch&apos;s pioneering theories. (Burman-Hall and<br/>Bill Slye&apos;s informative CD liner notes provide a fuller explanation of<br/>these tuning issues.) Despite the temperamental experimentation, and a<br/>freewheeling structure that eschews barlines, the music (written for a<br/>never-realized puppet production of the classic French play) is a<br/>deeply affecting evocation of both the ancient Rome of the script and<br/>the 17th-century Paris of the playwright. As with so much of this<br/>composer&apos;s work, Cinna manages to be at once radically</p><p>progressive and strikingly beautiful. It&apos;s spellbinding music like<br/>this that makes Lou Harrison one of the great composers of the 20th<br/>century.&quot;</p><p>---------</p><p>Start with Harrison and work backward - you can&apos;t go wrong.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=42269 href="#42269">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2003 9:14:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Ok ok ok.

If you feel you need to be constrained to a keyboard, you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; find more than you thought. First off, I really enjoy a short sonata<br/>&gt; movement by list member Chris Bailey in that was retuned to 7 limit<br/>&gt; just intonation by a former list member. Find the file at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/sonata.7lim.mp3">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/sonata.7lim.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for an idea of what can be done. Also, while not a lot of his stuff<br/>&gt; really does it for me, Jeff Harrington has quite a bit of keyboard<br/>&gt; work for differing intonations. I mention him because he seems to come<br/>&gt; from a keyboard orientation (rather than an orchestral composer using<br/>&gt; a keyboard to get the work done; if I&apos;m way off base on JH, someone<br/>&gt; can let me know). He seems to be very adept at self promotion, so<br/>&gt; either do a Google search or ask around; I&apos;m pretty sure he has a<br/>&gt; bunch of stuff on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> and other sound areas, and may have his own<br/>&gt; web site. Again, not always my cup of tea, but it isn&apos;t just dicking<br/>&gt; around on a keyboard either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lastly and most importantly, how about music from one of the giants of<br/>&gt; the last hundred years who just left us? Lou Harrison? (I&apos;m reposting<br/>&gt; the next bit, which I posted just a week ago - read the list<br/>&gt; carefully!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I came across a review of a recent recording of keyboard works of Lou<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harrison on <a href="http://andante.com">andante.com</a> - you can read the review (and there is a nice<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; interview with Lou in the latest main pages) here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=19715">http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=19715</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What struck me, vis a vis recent threads, was the last paragraph:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The most fascinating work here is 1957&apos;s Music for Corneille&apos;s Cinna,<br/>&gt; the recording of which occasioned a controversy in microtonal music<br/>&gt; circles. Burman-Hall first recorded it on a proper tack piano &iuml;&iquest;&half; but in<br/>&gt; the wrong tuning; after some discussion among pianist, composer,<br/>&gt; record company and others, she re-recorded it in Harrison&apos;s specified<br/>&gt; seven-limit just intonation. The tuning matters because this landmark<br/>&gt; of microtonal experimentation represents one of Harrison&apos;s most<br/>&gt; successful responses to Partch&apos;s pioneering theories. (Burman-Hall and<br/>&gt; Bill Slye&apos;s informative CD liner notes provide a fuller explanation of<br/>&gt; these tuning issues.) Despite the temperamental experimentation, and a<br/>&gt; freewheeling structure that eschews barlines, the music (written for a<br/>&gt; never-realized puppet production of the classic French play) is a<br/>&gt; deeply affecting evocation of both the ancient Rome of the script and<br/>&gt; the 17th-century Paris of the playwright. As with so much of this<br/>&gt; composer&apos;s work, Cinna manages to be at once radically<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; progressive and strikingly beautiful. It&apos;s spellbinding music like<br/>&gt; this that makes Lou Harrison one of the great composers of the 20th<br/>&gt; century.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Start with Harrison and work backward - you can&apos;t go wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=42313 href="#42313">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2003 3:46:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ekin@lumma.org">ekin@lumma.org</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;  Riley, Young, Harrison, fall inside the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; big block, but do not produce scores, which it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; isn&apos;t clear if Michael requires (I assumed he<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; did).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What makes you think they don&apos;t have scores?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, didn&apos;t mean to include Young there.

Yes?</p><p>Actually, The Well-Tuned Piano is an interesting test case in this respect. In its current form, the &quot;score,&quot; or score, or &quot;&quot;&quot;score,&quot;&quot;&quot; as you wish, consists of La Monte&apos;s thematic skeletons and harmonic areas, and also of abundant transcriptions from his recordings made by La Monte, Michael Harrison, and myself. There&apos;s no theoretical reason that anyone couldn&apos;t make his or her own transcriptions of themes from one recording or another, send them to La Monte, and, if he approved them, have them become part of the official score. Almost the entire WTP could be transcribed, except for the &quot;clouds,&quot; which are (as you all know) chords strummed in a tremolo manner; these could be roughly notated in some free fashion. I transcribed about 20 minutes of the 1981 recording (out of five hours, 1/15th of the entire work), and it didn&apos;t take that long; a matter of days, not months or weeks. There are a few passages in which there are four-note chords involving internal pitches only 27 cents apart, and for those passages, La Monte&apos;s thematic notations may be essential (unless you can hear a 27-cent difference in the middle of a closely-spaced microtonal chord; I couldn&apos;t - I guess Johnny Reinhard could). But one could make a fully notated score of the WTP and perform from it, essentially duplicating one of La Monte&apos;s recordings; but due to the nature of the work, it would be a score which would not have to be followed closely, since improvisation is allowed and even expected. By comparing recordings (the commercially [un]available CD and DVD, for instance), one could assemble one&apos;s own version. In that case it is a little like a Baroque keyboard work, in which the melodic/harmonic skeleton is given but ornaments are left to the player and assumed desirable. If La Monte were a &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;normal&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; composer and would distribute his damn music, we&apos;d probably already have such performances by now. As it is, I last heard the WTP live in 1987, and am not sure I expect to again in my lifetime. But give me a summer off from other work and I could come up with a total score.</p><p>I suspect much the same could be said for The Harp of New Albion.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=42331 href="#42331">ðŸ”—</a>Michael McGonagle &#x3C;fndsnd@rcnchicago.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2003 7:43:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David,</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions, but Carl was correct in assuming that I was looking for &quot;Piano&quot; works, I should have stated that I am looking for piece to learn that are performable by a live musician.

I have heard recordings of &quot;in C&quot; by a typical orchestra, a chamber group of about 30 soloists, a rock band, a Chinese Kyoto orchestra (which I believe was in some &quot;traditional&quot; chinese tuning, it did leave an impression on me, but that was years ago that I heard that recording, I wish I could remember who it was).</p><p>Anyway, back to my inquiry. I have started practicing a lot more lately, and have gotten to the point where I can reproduce some &quot;altered&quot; tunings on my keyboard, so I would like to find some notated pieces, mostly to start &quot;baptizing&quot; myself with the cool waters of non-12edo music (alright, I am being just a little flipant, sorry)...</p><p>Paul, I think you had wondered if I could read a score &quot;as notated&quot; and not as tuned. Frankly, I have not seen too many microtonal scores, and the ones that I have seen seem cluttered with a lot of numbers. It took too much time to try and understand what was meant. It has been some years, so I would like to see what things are the most prevelent (ie common practice, if there is such a thing).</p><p>I will look for all of these recordings that were mentioned. I did listen to Chris Bailey&apos;s Piano stuff, amazing work. I did listen to some of his other stuff as well!!!!</p><p>Thanks for replying to this.</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=42414 href="#42414">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2003 8:28:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joel Rodrigues &lt;jdrodrigues@P...&gt;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_42257.html#42353">/tuning/topicId_42257.html#42353</a></p><p> wrote:<br/>&gt; Re. the exchanges between Carl and the rest of you - I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; laughed this much in days.
