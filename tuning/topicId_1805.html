Or as you say, the (odd<br/>limit<br/>&gt;minus one) over two.</p><p>Yes, but the odd limit would have to be specified in advance.</p><p>&gt;Some ratios will appear twice, you just take the most<br/>&gt;direct route, and you&apos;re golden.</p><p>I thought I wrote that!</p><p>&gt;&gt;But if you have an 11-axis in the lattice, then that means you&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt;considering 11-limit intervals consonant, so you should also consider<br/>&gt;9-&gt;limit intervals consonant, and you should have a 9-axis too. That<br/>would<br/>&gt;make &gt;9:5 a single step of length lg(9).</p><p>&gt;Exactly!</p><p>Yeah, this is where the Hahn/Op de Coul algorithm went awry.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But the basic insight is that a triangular lattice, with Tenney-like<br/>&gt;&gt;lengths, a city-block metric, and odd axes or wormholes, agrees with<br/>the<br/>&gt;odd &gt;limit perfectly</p><p>&gt;Only up to the point you&apos;ve declared consonant!  The problem with your<br/>&gt;algorithm is it has no way to measure intervals outside of those you<br/>&gt;declare consonant.</p><p>Well, if you are allowed to declare an odd limit for consonance, it<br/>_can_ measure intervals that are composites of consonant intervals<br/>(using the lattice), it just can&apos;t measure intervals using higher prime<br/>numbers. But since those prime numbers aren&apos;t used in any consonances,<br/>then they&apos;re completely analogous to irrationals in the prime-based<br/>measures we&apos;ve discussed -- irrevocably outside the system.</p><p>&gt;&gt;but since the competing harmonic complexity formulae didn&apos;t impose any<br/>&gt;limit &gt;to the number of dimensions in the lattice, why should mine?</p><p>&gt;It shouldn&apos;t, but it should have a way to consider the shortest-route<br/>&gt;factorization of intervals above the declared odd limit.</p><p>Yes, and Paul Hahn&apos;s algorithm, with vector entries for all odd numbers<br/>up to the limit instead of just primes, looks like the right way to<br/>implement my idea for that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Nah, I just lost you. What did you mean? I know that 5/4 is the space<br/>&gt;&gt;between 5/1 and 4/1. So?</p><p>&gt;So the mediant of 5/1 and 4/1 is 9/2.</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt;Hence (n+d)/2.  Is this an incorrect<br/>&gt;generalization for dyads?</p><p>I&apos;m still not following you.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why not just throw a 2-axis on the lattice and weight by log<br/>prime/odd<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;limit as before?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Of course that would have no effect on the metric.</p><p>&gt;?  I&apos;m saying consider 2 a factor just like 3 or 5.  This would be like<br/>&gt;Hahn&apos;s whole-number-limit.</p><p>Well, if you weight by prime or odd limit like you said, then the 2 will<br/>never come into the weighting of any intervals, except those which are<br/>octave-equivalent to the unison. But if you use the whole-number-limit,<br/>then you do have something worth considering.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;And 11/6 does?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I never claimed much importance for local minima of harmonic entropy,</p><p>&gt;That&apos;s true, you&apos;re on record for that (do I understand correctly that<br/>you<br/>&gt;prefer to take a given value, and see the probabilities of ratios from<br/>&gt;there?).  But didn&apos;t this thread start by you saying something about<br/>the<br/>&gt;lack of a local minima at 11/8?</p><p>Well, if there&apos;s no local minimum at 11/8, then there&apos;s really no ground<br/>for distinguishing 11/8 from nearby rational or irrational intervals,<br/>based on harmonic entropy. Of course, combination tones, and, for<br/>timbres with strong 8th and 11th partials, beating and critical-band<br/>roughness, may provide 11/8 with some &quot;specialness&quot;.</p></div>
