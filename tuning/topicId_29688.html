I guess<br/>&gt; I&apos;m really not involved enough in Early Music performance practices<br/>&gt; to appreciate this &quot;evolution&quot; fully...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s hard to believe that ensembles are still playing Medieval and<br/>&gt; Renaissance music in 12-tET, but that seems to be what you are<br/>&gt; implying...</p><p>Don&apos;t forget that, for Medieval, 12tet is really doing a very good<br/>job. Perhaps the dissonances aren&apos;t dissonant enough, and if the<br/>music is veering into schismic territory then 12 will completely<br/>fail be making an equivalence out of a dissonance and a new<br/>consonance, but the primary consonances are represented extremely<br/>well.</p><p>For those who got the latest 1/1 (journal of the Just Intonation<br/>Network) Lou Harrisons keynote is presented there where he points<br/>out how the early music people are spiritual allys to the JI<br/>crowd. I think his point applies to all tuning folk. If the music<br/>is supposed to be tuned different, then tune it different!</p><p>Bob Valentine</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________ ________ ______<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=29698 href="#29698">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/28/2001 3:40:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_29688.html#29688">/tuning/topicId_29688.html#29688</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t forget that, for Medieval, 12tet is really doing a very good<br/>&gt; job.

Despite McClaren&apos;s feeling that academia is<br/>protective of ET,  the noses of many camels are at least near the edge of the<br/>tent, and there are several places in which the well-tempered beasts are in!<br/>   At Vanderbilt, there is now a row of practise rooms with grands that I<br/>keep in various stages of non-ET tunings, (well-tempered) and our new Early<br/>Music prof.  is knowledgable on the subject.  We will be keeping the<br/>harpsichords in a variety of tuning, with the Werckmeister being the most<br/>recent.<br/>   Meantone tuning is hard to sell out in the field, but the academic<br/>environment is giving these tunings a shot at influencing the next generation<br/>of musicians. I say this is progress.  (We should be ready when Margot picks<br/>up her pair of synths and  goes on 100,000 watt &quot;Twin Towers Of Harmony&quot;<br/>tour)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p><p>&gt;&gt;</p></div>
