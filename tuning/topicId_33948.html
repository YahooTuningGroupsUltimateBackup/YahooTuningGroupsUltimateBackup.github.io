Well, as Gene attests, the two systems are *very*<br/>similar.</p><p>But, instead of an arrow for 1/12th of a whole tone, the performer<br/>would be asked to play a *QUARTER tone!*</p><p>Since the same kinds of arrows are used in both systems for different<br/>things, this presents a real problem for a *trained* performer who<br/>has already *practiced* 1/12 whole tone as the arrow!</p><p>Certainly everybody on this list who is, or has been, a performer<br/>knows how difficult it is to change habits like that!</p><p>What a nightmare!</p><p>Now, one might say:  &quot;Well, the Sims/Maneri people are never going to<br/>*see* the &quot;Monzonote&quot; scores, so what difference does it make?&quot;</p><p>However, I would contest that statement.  I think they eventually<br/>will.</p><p>Why?  Well, once these scores start to circulate... and I will rather<br/>vainly suggest that at least *mine* will  :) [since I send lots of<br/>stuff out...] performers will hear that there are these pieces in 72-<br/>tET.</p><p>The 72-tETers will be *particularly* interested in them, since<br/>they&apos;re interested in 72 to start with.</p><p>Can anybody *seriously* suggest that these performers are not going<br/>to ever see and try to play the &quot;Monzo-suggested&quot; notation, if pieces<br/>were written in it??</p><p>I rather doubt that seriously...  What confusion would result!</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=33955 href="#33955">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2002 10:02:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>[massive snip...]<br/>&gt; Can anybody *seriously* suggest that these performers are not going<br/>&gt; to ever see and try to play the &quot;Monzo-suggested&quot; notation, if<br/>&gt; pieces were written in it??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I rather doubt that seriously...

And,<br/>so far, the Sims/Maneri people are practicing 72-tET more than<br/>anybody else, so I am going to stick with their system and the ASCII<br/>emulations.</p><p>JP</p></div>
