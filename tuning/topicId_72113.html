Versions are uploaded for classical<br/>guitar and piano as MIDI files and an mp3 using Logic&apos;s Classical<br/>Guitar sample.</p><p>I&apos;ve become very fond of 9ET while working on this. I first saw<br/>9ET in its relation to 12ET as three augmented triads, where the<br/>scale steps between them could only be used as m2 / M7s but<br/>not as M2 / m7. I found this works pretty well, and the rules can also<br/>be bent a little. Major and minor thirds both work well, and the minor has<br/>a nice septimal resonance. The fifths have to be used with caution<br/>harmonically, but melodically and in arpeggios I find the sound of the<br/>4ths and 5ths exciting, and I used lots of circle of fifths progressions.<br/>Feedback welcome as always, and of course I&apos;m interested to hear<br/>other things in 9ET, so please alert me. Enjoy!</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2007 5:29:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Andrew Hunt &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Feedback welcome as always, and of course I&apos;m interested to hear<br/>&gt; other things in 9ET, so please alert me. Enjoy!</p><p>One of the most striking things about 9-et is that two steps of it give<br/>an almost exact 7/6: 2^(2/9) is 266.667 cents, and 7/6 is 266.871<br/>cents. By stacking 9-ets a quarter-tone (or more precisely, 49 cents)<br/>apart you get sensibly just 7-limit intervals (ennealimmal temperament<br/>MOS.)</p></div>
