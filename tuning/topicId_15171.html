Despite my mentioning of the 21st and 27th identies I have ear tested<br/>&gt;&gt;them and prefer the 11th and 13th harmonics in these circumstances.<br/>&gt;&gt;So I<br/>&gt;&gt;will probably venture further north and south and further north east and<br/>&gt;&gt;south west in my periodicity blocks [ie more 5 and 7 less 3]</p><p>and Paul wrote.</p><p>&gt;11 and 13 are distinct primes and you&apos;ll never get them by combining any<br/>&gt;number of 5s and 7s. So perhaps we should look at 13-limit periodicity<br/>&gt;blocks -- or did I misunderstand you?</p><p>Yes I do realise that the 11 and 13 primes require additional dimensions.</p><p> What I was saying was that as well as exploring 11 and 13.

I always tune my open strings<br/>to a chord [these will contain the transpositions I want to use]<br/>I feel that having fretlets is no problem either. And if you don&apos;t have<br/>fretlets not  having the same notes on all strings is is only a conceptual<br/>barrier brought about by 12tet thinking [it&apos;s not wrong it&apos;s just<br/>different.]</p><p>I think 13 limit periodicity blocks would be well worth examining.</p><p>Justin White</p></div>
