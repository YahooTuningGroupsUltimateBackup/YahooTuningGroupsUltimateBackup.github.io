As a starting point,<br/>I wanted a 1/5 comma meantone temperament comprising all the 15 major and 15<br/>minor keys. Next, I wanted septimal intervals for each and all of them. I<br/>calculated the exact position for 7/1 for each key. On the 14th fifth from<br/>C, there is a wolf sized 718 cents, but no one should need to use it.<br/>Finally, I wanted the scale to be quasi-cyclic with middle second intervals.<br/>Attached is the result. Notice, that when modulating towards sharps by leaps<br/>of fifths, you may use excellent JI approximations.</p><p>It is an excellent Maqam tuning, with 9 &quot;commas&quot; to the whole tone.</p><p>Oz.</p></div>
