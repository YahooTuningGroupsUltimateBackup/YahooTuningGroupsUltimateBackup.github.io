To oversimplify a bit, while European classical music is ON the beat, so to speak, blues and other Afro inspired musics are sort of between the beat, and not very easy to notate on paper...again, it needs to be felt and internalized. I call it the grease, and without that component blues sounds, actually, rather humorous. While most musicians will count a blues rhythm in 4/4 time, it&apos;s really 12/8, with incredible deviations from the basic pulse, sort of micro rhythms, if you will, and very difficult for most people to do well. My students, for the most part, have a hell of a time just learning a simple, one chord funk vamp, like a James Brown thing, because they always want to play right on the beat, but it ain&apos;t there, and it can take a long time to get that part of blues related music down.<br/>  I have a record of Islamic music, and one of the cuts is a percussionist, accompanied by some sort of lute (it&apos;s Afghan musicians, I believe)...it&apos;s a percussion solo, but the amazing thing is the lute accompaniment, which sounds exactly like an American boogie-woogie pattern...in C, it is C-E-G-A-Bb-A-G-E-C. I&apos;ve played that for my blues students, and they crack up. So, somehow there&apos;s a connection between Arabic music and North American blues styles, and of course the basic pentatonic sort of blues scale came over with the slaves, so that&apos;s not surprising. And, I just read an interview with one of Dizzy Gillespie&apos;s old pianists/arrangers (Mike Longo), and he said that he and Diz were in agreement that jazz was, basically, African rhythmic concepts mixed with European harmonic structures...quite true.<br/>  And, one reason I like 19 tone eq temp is because you can take traditional forms, such as blues, jazz, country etc, and stretch them a bit, to where it still sounds familiar, but a bit whacked. I&apos;ve rewritten Coltrane&apos;s &quot;Giant Steps&quot; for 19, and it&apos;s a hoot, cause it now has 28 measures instead of 16, and is a sonofabitch to play. That&apos;s why the retro jazz thing that&apos;s so prominent now is such a drag...I think that non 12 systems, such as 19 and others, is exactly where jazz needs to go to remain vital and challenging...but, it ain&apos;t happening. Most of the time on the local Denver jazz outlet, you can&apos;t tell if it&apos;s 1955 or 2005, cause everybody&apos;s doing the classics again. It&apos;s like what&apos;s happened to classical music, it&apos;s fossilized to the point of complete boredom...trying my best to change that...HHH<br/>PS...speaking of jazz, I just saw David Leibman&apos;s 18 piece big band...absolutely mind blowing, with great writing/arranging/playing from all...state of the art music....</p></div><h3><a id=61499 href="#61499">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2005 12:27:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Please Neil, Afghan musicians do not play Arabic Music unless born and raised in pre-dominantly Arabicized countries.

B King,<br/>and also Jimi Hendrix&apos;s blues playing, so that&apos;s where<br/>my posts apply most.</p><p>A couple of specific comments ... which brings this discussion<br/>back to where it started, pentatonicism:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, somehow there&apos;s a connection between Arabic music<br/>&gt; and North American blues styles, and of course the basic<br/>&gt; pentatonic sort of blues scale came over with the slaves,<br/>&gt; so that&apos;s not surprising.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to dispute that, but it should also be<br/>noted that pentatonic scales are the foundation of<br/>*many* types of music all over the world, especially<br/>in the folk and pop genres.</p><p>The Europeans who settled in America already had<br/>pentatonic folksongs they brought with them, so the<br/>pentatonicism of the blues didn&apos;t necessarily &quot;come&quot;<br/>from Africa. More below ...</p><p>&gt; And, I just read an interview with one of Dizzy<br/>&gt; Gillespie&apos;s old pianists/arrangers (Mike Longo),<br/>&gt; and he said that he and Diz were in agreement that<br/>&gt; jazz was, basically, African rhythmic concepts mixed<br/>&gt; with European harmonic structures...quite true.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s the standard story concerning jazz.<br/>It started with ragtime, which fused the European<br/>1-2 march beat in the left hand of the piano part<br/>with the &quot;ragged timing&quot; of the right hand part<br/>emulating banjo picking styles.</p><p>But note that the blues *also* are a combination of<br/>African and European elements ... altho in the blues<br/>i would dare say the African elements are both more<br/>prominent and more important. In ragtime and jazz,<br/>the two cultural styles were more equally balanced.</p><p>But my point is that blues too has aspects of Euro-based<br/>folksong in it, particularly from the angle of Christian<br/>spirituals sung by African-American slaves which have<br/>their roots in Euro-style hymns.</p><p>Recently i took on the volunteer job as pianist for<br/>the choir which sings at a monthly African mass in a<br/>Catholic church. I do it because i love the African<br/>music ... but i was fascinated to find out how much<br/>African catholics use and love the old-fashioned hymns,<br/>such as &quot;What A Friend We Have In Jesus&quot;. I hadn&apos;t<br/>expected that, and those hymns are *so* different from<br/>the really African music of the other pieces we do.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve rewritten Coltrane&apos;s &quot;Giant Steps&quot; for 19, and<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a hoot, cause it now has 28 measures instead of 16,<br/>&gt; and is a sonofabitch to play.</p><p>I want to hear that! It&apos;s one of my all-time faves.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s why the retro jazz thing that&apos;s so prominent now<br/>&gt; is such a drag... &lt;snip&gt; It&apos;s like what&apos;s happened to<br/>&gt; classical music, it&apos;s fossilized to the point of complete<br/>&gt; boredom...</p><p>I hear you there! I&apos;ve thought the same thing myself.</p><p>PS -- Neil, if i make to the next MahlerFest this coming<br/>January (in Boulder), i *definitely* want to get together<br/>with you!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
