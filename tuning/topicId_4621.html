Just tried it and yes if i play a CG then<br/>A# or D they sound more dissonant.  Both have a slight tinge of wanting to<br/>resolve. All in all numbers that are close together are really hard to<br/>distinguished. On the other hand, it considers that all inversions of a tetrad<br/>are not the same order of dissonant. Something Helmholtz shows, that both the<br/>odd or prime system seem to ignore.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -C.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
