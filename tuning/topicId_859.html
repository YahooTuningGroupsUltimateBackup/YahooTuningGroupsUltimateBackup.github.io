A. Wagenaar and A. M. Mimpen,<br/>&gt;&quot;Musical Interval Recognition with Simultaneous Tones,&quot;<br/>&gt;Acustica, Vol. 29, 1973, pg. 101]</p><p>I&apos;ll have to look that one up.  If you&apos;ve previously<br/>posted a larger excerpt from this paper, just let me<br/>know the message number or approx. date.</p><p>&gt;     Carl Lumma also ignored the following result, which I<br/>&gt;also posted previously on this forum:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;An experiment on the perception of melodic intervals by<br/>&gt;musically untrained observers showed no evidence for the<br/>&gt;existence of &grave;natural&apos; categories for musical intervals.&quot; [E. M.<br/>&gt;Burns and W. D. Ward, &quot;Categorical Perception--Phenomenon or<br/>&gt;Epiphenomenon: Evidence from experiments in the perception of<br/>&gt;melodic musical intervals,&quot; J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 63, No.<br/>&gt;2, 1978, pp. 456-468]</p><p>That&apos;s _melodic_ intervals.  This may be relevant to Boomsliter<br/>and Creel&apos;s work, but not to my discussion of an integer detector,<br/>which pertained to harmonic intervals only.</p><p>&gt;     &quot;Our experimentation verified that &grave;perfect&apos; consonances<br/>&gt;are not a constituent of a Central African concept of the scale.<br/>&gt;These musicians do not judge a strict octave (1200 cents) to be<br/>&gt;better than a large major seventh (1150 cents) or a small minor<br/>&gt;ninth (1250 cents). On the contrary, the Banda Linda musicians<br/>&gt;prefer the small &grave;octave&apos; (1150 cents) in any register, probably<br/>&gt;because of the roughness it creates on the octaves that are<br/>&gt;always played simultaneously with double sticks in each hand.&quot;<br/>&gt;[Voisin, Frederic, &quot;Musical Scales in Central Africa and Java:<br/>&gt;Modeling by Synthesis,&quot; Leonardo Music Journal, Vol. 4, 1994,<br/>&gt;pg. 89]</p><p>One could say (a) the effects of roughness interfere with those<br/>of our hypothetical integer detector mechanism for these inharmonic<br/>timbres and/or (b) this is a style choice; the existence of an<br/>integer detector does not mean our music must &apos;satisfy&apos; it.</p><p>&gt;      If humans had a built-in &grave;integer detector&apos; in their ear/<br/>&gt;brain system, all peoples everywhere would have perfect consonances<br/>&gt;as a constituent of their concept of the musical scales.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t follow.  See (b) above.</p><p>&gt;      &quot;MEG is now widely used to record the responses of the auditory<br/>&gt;cortex to sound stimuli. This technique is based on the fact that<br/>&gt;changes in neuronal potentials across cell membranes are accompanied<br/>&gt;by the flow of currents, and current flows induce magnetic fields.<br/>&gt;(..)<br/>&gt;       &quot;The authors failed to find a single neuron that responded<br/>&gt;to a harmonic series in a manner closely similar to the way it<br/>&gt;responded to the fundamental frequency of the harmonic series used.<br/>&gt;They concluded that pitch is not likely to be represented in the<br/>&gt;primary auditory cortex and other adjacent fields that they<br/>&gt;studied.&quot; [Weinberger, Norman M., &quot;Music and the Auditory System,&quot;<br/>&gt;in &quot;The Psychology of Music,&quot; ed. Diana Deutsch, Academic Press:<br/>&gt;1999, pg. 67]</p><p>This incomplete quote could just as easily support an integer detector<br/>hypothesis... only the fundamental of a complex tone is being passed<br/>to the level that the authors were looking at (for example).</p><p>&gt;        The documented fact that pitch is mapped in the human<br/>&gt;tonotopically according to logarithmic pitch rather than frequency<br/>&gt;(op cit.) means that frequency ratios get lost when they are mapped<br/>&gt;into the human brain.  As a result, there cannot exist frequency<br/>&gt;ratio detectors inside the human brain, since once converted to<br/>&gt;logarithmically arranged points of excitation within the brain,<br/>&gt;no ratio information between the notes of dyads remains...only<br/>&gt;information on the logarithmic pitch distance twixt the two tones.</p><p>Sounds promising, but I&apos;m not &apos;choosing to ignore&apos; anything by stating<br/>that your excerpts are not satisfactory to prove what you claim is<br/>proven... they are not even enough to convey complete ideas.  The reader<br/>of your posts is left with nothing but your frothing word, Brian.<br/>If you&apos;re going to spend the bandwidth, might as well try and explain<br/>the ideas you use to back your arguments.</p><p>&gt;It stands to reason that Carl Lumma cannot provide us with<br/>&gt;such a citation, since he has not studied the psychoacoustic<br/>&gt;literature in sufficient detail to do so.</p><p>That&apos;s accurate, more or less.  I don&apos;t have expertise in<br/>psychoacoustics.  I don&apos;t see evidence that you do, either,<br/>Brian.  In any case, if my claims are so patently false,<br/>show me, or tell me what papers I should read.  I&apos;ll get<br/>the Weinberger and Plomp papers...</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Tenney complexity<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>&gt;   First, Carl Lumma merely claims that Tenney&apos;s metric<br/>&gt;&quot;has been found to agree fairly well with something people<br/>&gt;can hear.&quot;  That is completely different from the claim<br/>&gt;that Tenney&apos;s metric involves &quot;frequency ratio detectors&quot;<br/>&gt;inside the human brain, which Carl was presumably trying<br/>&gt;to prove.</p><p>Nope.  I never said anything about Tenney&apos;s metric having<br/>to do with the integer detector hypothesis.  It&apos;s a<br/>completely different topic, as you seem to agree.</p><p>&gt;But the most important point is debunking James<br/>&gt;Tenney&apos;s musically meaningless mathematical calisthenics<br/>&gt;(the so-called &quot;Tenney dissonance&quot; metric) is the fact<br/>&gt;that neither James Tenney nor Carl Lumma nor Paul Erlich<br/>&gt;seems to recognize the vast chasm which separate<br/>&gt;acoustic roughness (which Tenney&apos;s metric purports to<br/>&gt;measure, but actually doesn&apos;t) and M*U*S*I*C*A*L<br/>&gt;dissonance.</p><p>Bzzz.  Tenney complexity does not purport to measure<br/>roughness.  We&apos;ve speculated it has to do with the<br/>periodicity mechanism (it looks a lot like harmonic<br/>entropy over the rationals, as I mentioned), but all<br/>I said was that it corresponds to something people<br/>(like Tenney, Genovese, Myself, Breed, Erlich, Keenan,<br/>Pehrson) seem to be able to hear.</p><p>&gt;    There exists an example using major sevenths which<br/>&gt;sound smooth when played with the correct Csound timbres,<br/>&gt;while a perfect 2:1 octave sounds unbearably rough,<br/>&gt;on track 14 of my CD &quot;Introduction To Microtonality.&quot;<br/>&gt;    The same track contains Csound examples showing<br/>&gt;a diminished fifth dyad which sounds smooth, while<br/>&gt;the 3:2 interval played with the same timbres sounds<br/>&gt;unbearably rough, and an example showing a 12-equal<br/>&gt;minor seventh interval played as a dyad which sounds<br/>&gt;smooth, while the 2:1 octave sounds unbearably rough.</p><p>Right- the roughness obscures the effect.  I&apos;ve got the<br/>CD, you know.</p><p>&gt;    Naturally Carl Lumma was too arrogant to bother to<br/>&gt;listen to my CD and consequently too ignorant of<br/>&gt;such simple and obvious counterexamples to realize that<br/>&gt;his claim about the debunked and pervasively false<br/>&gt;and musically useless metric known as &quot;Tenney<br/>&gt;dissonance&quot; was systematically false.</p><p>All wrong.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Boomsliter and Creel<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;Where in that quote, Brian, are you getting difference<br/>&gt;&gt;tones?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   If Carl Lumma were knowledgable of Boomsliter &amp;<br/>&gt;Creel&apos;s theory of the auditory system, he would<br/>&gt;realize that Boomsliter &amp; Creel model the human<br/>&gt;auditory system&apos;s frequency detection mechanism<br/>&gt;on difference tones -- a methodology now known to<br/>&gt;be incorrect.</p><p>I&apos;ve read every extant paper by Boomsliter and Creel,<br/>creating, at Erv&apos;s request, what may be the most<br/>complete library of Boomsliter and Creel materials on<br/>the planet, distributing parts back to Erv and Chalmers...</p><p>You&apos;ll have to show me, Brian, where difference tones<br/>have anything to do with extended reference.  As I<br/>said, Boomsliter and Creel made many different guesses<br/>as to how the ear/brain was getting the preference<br/>of small just ratios... none of which were compelling,<br/>considered anything more than speculation by their authors,<br/>and none of which have anything to do with their main<br/>thesis.</p><p>Instead, the one paragraph you&apos;ve actually produced<br/>about difference tones and extended reference was<br/>total gibberish... like your stuff about &quot;5-limit JI&quot;<br/>and adaptive tuning, it smacked of bluffery.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;There is not one shred of evidence for the false claim<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;that singers or string players &quot;naturally play in just<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;intonation,&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;You never said what type of JI you meant -- melodic or<br/>&gt;harmonic -- and you cussed me out when I asked.  At the<br/>&gt;time, we were discussing adaptive tuning, which deals with<br/>&gt;harmonic intonation.  Now we&apos;re discussing B&amp;C, who deal<br/>&gt;with melodic intonation.  Which, or both, is it?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The classic logical fallacy of the irrelevant<br/>&gt;objection.</p><p>My comment was a question, not an objection.</p><p>&gt;     JI is JI.  No matter whether you retune chords and<br/>&gt;consequently warp and twist melodic pitches out of melodic<br/>&gt;tune, or you retune melodic pitches and consequently<br/>&gt;warp and twist vertical pitches out of tune...one way<br/>&gt;or the other, ya gotta warp and twist something out of<br/>&gt;tune somewhere, either melodically or harmonically.</p><p>&quot;Warp&quot; melodically &quot;out of tune&quot;, compared to 12-tET, you<br/>mean.  Unlike you, I tend to like comma shifts in melodies.<br/>Like David Doty, I&apos;d call them feature, not a bug.</p><p>But let&apos;s consider what you&apos;re calling an irrelevant<br/>objection... would you call meantone &quot;out of tune&quot;?<br/>Would you call it JI?  It has just major thirds... it has<br/>some degree of vertical JI.  What about JdL&apos;s adaptive<br/>temperament?  It can hide melodic &quot;warping&quot; very well<br/>in most cases -- in fact, beyond the ability of even the<br/>best ears to notice it, on balance.</p><p>&gt;      Listening experiments have proven conclusively<br/>&gt;that warping and twisting melodic pitches out of tune<br/>&gt;sounds more out of tune than warping and twisting harmonic<br/>&gt;pitches in chords out of tune...</p><p>Experiment_s_?  Only the Rasch seems pertinent here, and<br/>it has never been duplicated.  Also, &quot;more out of tune&quot;<br/>is quite a jump from &quot;more objectionable&quot;, which is what<br/>the experiment actually tries to measure.  Finally,<br/>&quot;objectionable&quot; doesn&apos;t mean very much in this experiment...<br/>it isn&apos;t a scientific quantity as Rasch uses it.  The<br/>testimonial evidence I&apos;ve seen to the contrary is enough<br/>to convince me that more is going on here than Rasch<br/>reports.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
