Dear monzo has made a page about one<br/>&#x9;&gt; the tetrachords in segah played by maestro ebadi ....<br/>&#x9;&gt; It is in 17-edo.</p><p>&#x9;Mohajeri is referring to this webpage:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?iranian-segah-mode.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?iranian-segah-mode.htm</a></p><p>&#x9;&gt;

In any case, I don&apos;t know any musician who can differentiate between 141/110 and 513/400 as these pitches are very proximous. 9/7 is a much better harmonic approximation with only 5 cents difference for the 4. degree of Saba Maqam.</p><p>I use the term pitch-cluster to signify a tightly-spread bundle of frequencies within a very short time-frame. All of these can be categorized as the same pitch-class, and the relationship of all ranges between two such consequent clusters can be categorized as the same interval-class. The distribution of frequencies is not as 3D, but as 2D along the pitch-continuum axis. Your concept of interval spectrum seems to be the same, but without articulations, vibrato, portamento, etc...</p><p>The fact that some &grave;perde&grave; of Maqams vary to a great extent within seyir (melodic excursions) convince me that pitch-clusters come into play more.</p><p>I think you should look at Paul Erlich&apos;s article on decatonality for harmonic tolerance: <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a></p><p>I have Dr. Akkoc&apos;s article in English in PDF format.

(as a dsfinition).</p><p>    As I told u and u wrote,the koron of segah is 356 cents which is with a good approximation the 16th degrees of 54-edo (5416=355.5556 cent) .it is in an spectrum which its center is 350 (which is 7221 , 4814 , 247 ).</p><p>    &mldr;&mldr;</p><p>    Dear monzo</p><p>    As the definition in ur ency.:</p><p>    An interval intermediate in size between the Major Third and the Minor Third.</p><p>    Neutral Thirds measure about 350 cents (&cent;) and typical examples are 11/9 (347&cent;), 27/22 (355&cent;) and 16/13 (359&cent;).</p><p>    I myself think theoretically that the best spectrum for neutral third is 350 &pm; 10 , (340 &mldr;&mldr;350 &mldr;&mldr;360) which is the sum of spectrum of minor third with spectrum of great dieses :</p><p>    But I must test it musically to see IF THE SPECTRUM HAS THE REAL TASTE !</p><p>    What is ur idea ?</p><p>    &mldr;&mldr;</p><p>    Dear ozan ! where are u yourself?what do you think about this?</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    From: monz [<a href="mailto:monz@tonalsoft.com">mailto:monz@tonalsoft.com</a>]<br/>    Sent: Wednesday, December 29, 2004 1:09 AM<br/>    To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>    Subject: [tuning] eastern interval-spectrum theory (was: dear ozan : thanks a lot for reply !!)</p><p>    hi Mohajeri,</p><p>    --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mohajeri Shahin&quot; &lt;shahinm@k...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; It is told that the structure of persian music is pythagorean<br/>    &gt; but if it is so?<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; It is only one choice. Dear monzo has made a page about one<br/>    &gt; the tetrachords in segah played by maestro ebadi &mldr;.<br/>    &gt; It is in 17-edo.</p><p>    Mohajeri is referring to this webpage:</p><p>    <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?iranian-segah-mode.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?iranian-segah-mode.htm</a></p><p>    &gt; We know that 17 is related to 34,51,&mldr;.. and 51 is near<br/>    &gt; to <a href="http://53.so">53.so</a> we may assum that there is a spectrum of edo&apos;s<br/>    &gt; with 53 in center:<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; &mldr;&mldr;. , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56&mldr;&mldr;.</p><p>    there is some truth to what you say here, in that,<br/>    by the point where there are that many divisions of<br/>    the &quot;octave&quot;, the differences in step-size are so small<br/>    that it is not very noticeable (particularly on traditional<br/>    persian instruments, which are not accurately tuned in these<br/>    temperaments ... forgive me if i&apos;m wrong about this, in my<br/>    ignorance of persian music and theory).  i.e, the<br/>    step-sizes of the temparaments you list here are:</p><p>    ET ... step-size in cents</p><p>    50 ... 24<br/>    51 ... 23.52941176<br/>    52 ... 23.07692308<br/>    53 ... 22.64150943<br/>    54 ... 22.22222222<br/>    55 ... 21.81818182<br/>    56 ... 21.42857143</p><p>    the difference is much more noticeable for the<br/>    lower-cardinality ETs, for example:</p><p>    ET ... step-size in cents</p><p>    10 ... 120<br/>    11 ... 109.0909091<br/>    12 ... 100<br/>    13 ... 92.30769231</p><p>    however, it should also be noted that different ETs<br/>    approximate JI in different ways.</p><p>    note that on my webpage, i point out that both 17-edo<br/>    and 24-edo give decent approximations to the cents-values<br/>    which you measured from Maestro Ebadi&apos;s performance.</p><p>    this is because both of these temperaments give a<br/>    good approximation to both the pythagorean intervals<br/>    *and* the (approximate) quarter-tones.</p><p>    often, 53-edo is also admitted into this company<br/>    (that is, tuning families which contain 17- and 24-edo),<br/>    because it gives a *superb* approximation to pythagorean<br/>    tuning. see, for example, the patterns of error-from-JI<br/>    under the family of tunings in which the &quot;skhisma&quot;<br/>    vanishes, on the colored applet graphic here:</p><p>    <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?bingo.htm&applet">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?bingo.htm&applet</a></p><p>    in the case of Maestro Ebadi&apos;s pentachord, 53-edo<br/>    *does* give a decent approximation to the _koron_<br/>    (which Mohajeri measured at 356 cents) -- which<br/>    is 16 degrees of 53-edo, or in precise mathematics,<br/>    2^(16/53) = ~362.2641509 cents.</p><p>    however, 53-edo fails to map the 2nd degree of Maestro<br/>    Ebadi&apos;s pentachord (which Mohajeri measured at 215 cents),<br/>    which falls almost exactly between 9 and 10 degrees of<br/>    53-edo.</p><p>    thus, while 53-edo does usually resemble both 17-edo<br/>    and 24-edo in many ways, in this particular case it<br/>    fails to give a representation of Maestro Ebadi&apos;s<br/>    performance which is as good as either of them.</p><p>    i think that what you (Mohajeri), Ozan, and Can Akkoc<br/>    are doing with interval-spectrum theory is very interesting.</p><p>    -monz</p><p>    You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>    of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>      <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> -
