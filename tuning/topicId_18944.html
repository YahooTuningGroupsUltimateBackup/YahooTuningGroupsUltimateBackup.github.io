Each is associated with a<br/>particular planet. the two below being Mercury and Mars. I have tried in<br/>the past to pull things out of them with lukewarm results. The most<br/>interesting was to have players play them as durations, choosing a row<br/>or diagonal freely with the result that everyone will still come down on<br/>the same beat every 15 or 65 beats. Much to do was done with the line<br/>figure that result when you  draw a line to the numbers in their natural<br/>order. In turn, everything from talismans and background patterns are<br/>refer to these magic squares without the need to write the numbers<br/>themselves!</p><p><a href="mailto:AMiltonF@aol.com">AMiltonF@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Howdy tuners!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was just skimming through the math stuff on the list and was<br/>&gt; reminded of a<br/>&gt; puzzle/pattern that fascinates me.  It&apos;s the old tic-tac-toe (or<br/>&gt; turtle back)<br/>&gt; number pattern that adds up to the same thing in all directions, like<br/>&gt; this...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8 1 6<br/>&gt; 3 5 7<br/>&gt; 4 9 2<br/>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt; 15&apos;s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; expanded...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17 24 1 8 15<br/>&gt; 23 5 7 14 16<br/>&gt; 4 6 13 20 22<br/>&gt; 10 12 19 21 3<br/>&gt; 11 18 25 2 9<br/>&gt; ---------------------------<br/>&gt; 65&apos;s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It always fascinates me because of how easy it is to generate these<br/>&gt; matrices<br/>&gt; if you know the pattern.  Just as long as it is square and has an odd<br/>&gt; length<br/>&gt; on its side, it works, and it is possible to generate infinitely huge<br/>&gt; (and<br/>&gt; seemingly complex (to me anyway)) matrices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It occurred to me that there are some really cool tunings in there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anybody done any work with something similar?<br/>&gt; Am I way out in left field?

There is a good book on his music by Paul<br/>Griffiths that explains some of this.
