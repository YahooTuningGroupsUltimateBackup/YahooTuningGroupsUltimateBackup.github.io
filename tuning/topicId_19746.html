This could also be an item for my planned FAQ draft on<br/>&quot;Meantone keyboards with 19 or more notes, 1550-1618.&quot;</p><p>First of all, in addition to the resources already mentioned, there is<br/>a complete facsimile reprint of his _La Sambuca Lincea_ (1618),<br/>including all of the original musical compositions and examples, plus<br/>a fine introductory commentary in Italian and English by Patrizio<br/>Barbieri, a scholar of such instruments, plus transcriptions of the<br/>music into modern notation:</p><p>Fabio Colonna, _La Sambuca Lincea, overo Dell&apos;Istromento Musico<br/>Perfetto, con annotazioni critiche manoscritte di Scipione Stella<br/>(1618-1622)_, ed. Patrizio Barbieri, Musurgiana 24 (Lucca: Libreria<br/>Musicale Italiana, 1991), ISSN 1121-0508, ISBN 88-7096-026-9.</p><p>With Colonna, as with Vicentino, it may be helpful to distinguish<br/>between their theoretical uses of various just ratios, simple and<br/>complex, and their 31-note meantone divisions of the octave likely<br/>based on 1/4-comma meantone, and modelled as a division of the tone<br/>into five equal dieses or fifthtones.</p><p>Here I&apos;ll give a bit of a summary, and also refer interested readers<br/>to my archicembalo article of October 1999, which has some material on<br/>Colonna&apos;s instrument and some of his enharmonic special effects:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5609">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5609</a> (Pt. 1)<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5621">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5621</a> (Pt. 2)<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5646">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5646</a> (Pt. 3)<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5670">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/5670</a> (Pt. 4 -- notes)</p><p>Basically the _Sambuca Lincea_, or &quot;Lynxian Sambuca,&quot; a harpischord<br/>named after a triangular Greek harp because of the resemblance in<br/>shape, and likely also in honor of the _Academia dei Lincei_ or<br/>Academy of Lynxes, a select scientific association to which the<br/>astronomer Galileo belonged, is a 31-note instrument similar to<br/>Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo in its first tuning (based on a 31-note<br/>cycle).</p><p>For some reason, two articles in the latest release at my local<br/>university library of the _New Grove Dictionary of Music and<br/>Musicians_ state that Colonna divided the instrument into _17_ parts,<br/>and I&apos;m not sure how this misconception got started. The correct<br/>number is 31.</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s two-manual instrument might be seen as a kind of<br/>extension of the typical split-key arrangement -- in fact, his<br/>archicembalo in its ideal 38-note form might be described as two<br/>typical 19-note split-key manuals -- Colonna tries to improve keyboard<br/>ergonomics by coming up with an early 17th-century version of what<br/>might now be termed a &quot;generalized keyboard.&quot; If I understand<br/>correctly, it might be rather similar to Adriaan Fokker&apos;s scheme<br/>implemented on his 31-tone organ.</p><p>Scipione Stella, an associate of Don Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa,<br/>had done some enharmonic experimenting of his own, and devised a<br/>keyboard somewhat resembling Vicentino&apos;s, but with eight ranks and<br/>some redundant notes to permit easier fingering choices.</p><p>Just who invented what became a hot issue, but Colonna&apos;s instrument<br/>featured five ranks of seven notes spaced a fifthtone apart, thus like<br/>Stella&apos;s instrument offering redundant keys for some notes as an<br/>ergonomic measure for the keyboardist.</p><p>Colonna&apos;s enharmonic notation is a bit different than Vicentino&apos;s: in<br/>addition to the usual sharps and flats which both theorists retain,<br/>Colonna introduces some new symbols, and sometimes uses a natural sign<br/>to show a note _lowered_ by 1/5-tone. Personally I lean toward<br/>Vicentino&apos;s system of usual sharps and flats plus a dot to show a note<br/>raised by a diesis -- using an asterisk for the dot, C-C*-C#-Db-Db*-D<br/>-- but this is a matter of taste.</p><p>Like Vicentino, Colonna tells us that the usual notes of his<br/>instrument are tuned as in common practice, implying meantone, with<br/>the 31-note cycle implying something very close to 1/4-comma<br/>temperament. Reflecting the popularity of 19-note chromatic<br/>harpsichords around Naples, Colonna remarks that the 19 notes shared<br/>with these instruments (Gb-B#) are tuned in the same manner.</p><p>His book includes some examples of enharmonic counterpoint by the<br/>composer Ascanio Mayone, as well as his own short pieces and examples,<br/>including an &quot;Example of Circulation&quot; with cadences visiting each of<br/>the 31 steps along the cycle of fifths and returning to the original<br/>sonority (here C Ionian).</p><p>He also gives examples of various modes transcribed to remote<br/>locations in his 31-note cycle, using solmization syllables to show<br/>the whole-tones and semitones (e.g. re-mi-fa-sol-re-mi-fa-sol for the<br/>Dorian mode).</p><p>While the logic of a 31-note meantone cycle determines the tuning of<br/>the Sambuca Lincea, Colonna advocates of a style of ornamentation and<br/>embellishment in keeping with adventurous trends around 1600 which<br/>features a use of such intervals as a fourth-plus-diesis at around 544<br/>cents, not too far from 11:8. In Vicentino&apos;s music, melodic fifthtone<br/>steps are typically managed so as to maintain usual Renaissance<br/>concords, with this composer&apos;s declared taste for a near-11:9<br/>(9/5-tone) a notable exception; Colonna, however, regards a bolder use<br/>of &quot;unusual&quot; intervals as charming rather than &quot;dissonant&quot; in an<br/>unpleasant sense.</p><p>This is again a matter of taste: I might have preferred modern<br/>transcriptions with some equivalent of either Vicentino&apos;s or Colonna&apos;s<br/>fifthtone notation rather than the use of double flats or sharps, but<br/>a classically trained musician accustomed to such accidentals might<br/>take a different view. Since this facsimile edition includes all of<br/>the original 1618 notation, the reader can turn to either version, or<br/>even use the transcriptions as a guide to getting acquainted with the<br/>original (by this period, musical notation is not too far from current<br/>conventions, at least from my curious historical perspective).</p><p>Barbieri&apos;s commentary also delves into Colonna&apos;s theory of just ratios<br/>presented in this treatise, featuring such ratios as 17:12. This<br/>theory is a very interesting part of just intonation or rational<br/>intonation history, as is Vicentino&apos;s theory extensively and artfully<br/>summarized by Bill Alves; I do want to clarify that Colonna&apos;s 31-note<br/>instrument, however, is based on a 31-note meantone cycle.</p><p>In other words, I would place both Vicentino and Colonna in the same<br/>general category as Lemme Rossi (1666), Christiaan Huygens (later 17th<br/>century), and Adriaan Fokker as advocates of a meantone cycle with 31<br/>equal or &quot;virtually equal&quot; dieses or fifthtones. Whatever could be<br/>played on Fokker&apos;s organ could also be played on the keyboards of<br/>Vicentino or Colonna, albeit with somewhat less precisely equal<br/>fifthtone steps if one uses likely 16th-17th century tuning methods<br/>(Ed Foote&apos;s principle of period technology).</p><p>In the introduction to his &quot;Example of Circulation,&quot; which deserves to<br/>be a xenharmonic monument much better known, Colonna this composition<br/>as proof that the tone divides evenly into five parts without any<br/>commas or other complications suggested by other theories. Of course,<br/>as we might add, this assertion implies a rather specific range of<br/>tempering, outside of which quite different equal or near-equal or<br/>notably unequal divisions may obtain.</p><p>However, this assertion, like Vicentino&apos;s observation that all<br/>intervals are available from all 31 steps in the meantone cycle tuning<br/>of his archicembalo, suggests a _conceptual model_ equivalent to<br/>31-tone equal temperament; and the slight difference of about 6.07<br/>cents between 31 meantone fifths at 1/4-comma and 18 pure octaves,<br/>again somewhat modified in practice because of the imprecisions of<br/>tuning by ear, might likely be small enough as not to modify a<br/>listener&apos;s impression of a symmetrical division.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2001 10:40:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; First of all, in addition to the resources already mentioned, there<br/>is<br/>&gt; a complete facsimile reprint of his _La Sambuca Lincea_ (1618),<br/>&gt; including all of the original musical compositions and examples,<br/>plus<br/>&gt; a fine introductory commentary in Italian and English by Patrizio<br/>&gt; Barbieri, a scholar of such instruments, plus transcriptions of the<br/>&gt; music into modern notation:</p><p>I may yet want to track that down.

A few more Xenharmonikons should be worth getting, but I&apos;ll<br/>hold off a while to see if the exchange rate improves.</p><p>&gt; While the logic of a 31-note meantone cycle determines the tuning of<br/>&gt; the Sambuca Lincea, Colonna advocates of a style of ornamentation<br/>and<br/>&gt; embellishment in keeping with adventurous trends around 1600 which<br/>&gt; features a use of such intervals as a fourth-plus-diesis at around<br/>544<br/>&gt; cents, not too far from 11:8.
