Sure don&apos;t mean to try and scare anyone off listening to<br/>anything...folks are all different, and need to come to their own<br/>conclusions about what they like/don&apos;t like.

It&apos;s also pre-atonal, in fact, for Schoenberg, it&apos;s just<br/>about pre-everything.</p><p>He had just assimilated Wagnerian style when he wrote<br/>&quot;Transfigured Night&quot; (usually known by its German name<br/>&quot;Verklaerte Nacht&quot;).  Only two years before, he had finished<br/>his String Quartet in D, which sounds very much like Dvorak.</p><p>Schoenberg assimilated the styles and techniques of his<br/>contemporaries at an incredibly fast rate. His next big piece<br/>after &quot;Verklaerte Nacht&quot; was &quot;Gurrelieder&quot;, which takes<br/>the Wagnerian style about as far as it can go.</p><p>The next after that was &quot;Pelleas und Melisande&quot;, written while<br/>he was close friends with Richard Strauss.  In that piece, he<br/>not only shows an assimilation of Strauss&apos;s style and<br/>technique, but in fact already starts advancing beyond it<br/>into uncharted harmonic territory.</p><p>A scant 3 years later, he wrote the &quot;Chamber Symphony&quot;<br/>Joe recommended.  That piece is permeated with chords<br/>built entirely in perfect 4ths and motives based on the<br/>whole-tone scale.  Here he stretched tonality about as far<br/>as it could go, and within two years was writing the first<br/>atonal compositions.</p><p>It&apos;s no surprise that &quot;Verklaerte Nacht&quot; is the one Schoenberg<br/>piece you liked - it&apos;s still by far his most popular piece.</p><p>&gt; Sure don&apos;t mean to try and scare anyone off listening to<br/>&gt; anything...folks are all different, and need to come to their<br/>&gt; own conclusions about what they like/don&apos;t like. Think for<br/>&gt; themselves...Hstick</p><p>Hope you didn&apos;t take my other response to you in the wrong<br/>spirit.  It&apos;s just that Schoenberg&apos;s work is so often dismissed<br/>by people who haven&apos;t really given it a chance.  The guy was<br/>a real genius, and an incredibly talented composer.  That<br/>he was able to fight the opposition he experienced in his<br/>own lifetime and keep plowing ahead with his unique vision<br/>says a lot for his character too.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21413 href="#21413">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/22/2001 7:14:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21371.html#21381">/tuning/topicId_21371.html#21381</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope you didn&apos;t take my other response to you in the wrong<br/>&gt; spirit.
