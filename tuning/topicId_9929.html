Against the &quot;experimental&quot; failures of<br/>&gt; the 60&apos;s, we have only to loosen the borders that separate us from our neighbors.<br/>&gt; -- Kraig Grady</p><p>It seems to me that, with the Internet, and the closing in of the world<br/>into practically one little room, such &quot;synthesis&quot; is inevitable.  Look<br/>at right here on the tuning list... we have Europeans we correspond with<br/>every day, and people all over the country in the US.
