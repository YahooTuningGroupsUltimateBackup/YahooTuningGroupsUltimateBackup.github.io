Very,<br/>&gt; very strong. Looking forward to the developement- it&apos;ll fugue for<br/>&gt; instance (bom, bom, buddi-duddi, (Bom, Buom, Buddi-Duddi!..))  and<br/>&gt; details.</p><p>Dear Cameron,</p><p>Thank you for your most encouraging response, and also the idea of<br/>&quot;development&quot; in the sense of some kind of contrapuntal follow-up<br/>piece, maybe analogous to Bach&apos;s form of prelude and fugue. And<br/>&quot;chutzpah&quot; is indeed a compliment!</p><p>The curious thing is that while I started out with the idea of mostly<br/>three-voice polyphony based on Shur, and there are certain Persian<br/>melodic figures present, the lead-up to the final cadence came out in<br/>a way that reminded me of Georgian polyphony.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I quickly note that this piece uses a subset of the O3<br/>temperament:</p><p>! prelude_in_shur.scl<br/>!<br/>Tuning set for _Prelude in Shur for Erv Wilson_ (10)<br/> 10<br/>!<br/> 138.28126<br/> 264.84376<br/> 472.26562<br/> 495.70313<br/> 633.98438<br/> 703.12500<br/> 760.54688<br/> 841.40625<br/> 967.96876<br/> 2/1</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude_in_shur.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude_in_shur.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s pretty much what I&apos;d call a &quot;standard&quot; nine-note set for a<br/>septimal version of Shur Dastgah, plus a step at 472 cents or around<br/>21/16, which in this piece serves as a perfect fifth for the 7/4<br/>step.</p><p>As noted in one of your recent posts, in Pythagorean tuning two 81/64<br/>major thirds come very close to 8/5; here, with these thirds a bit<br/>wider at 414.8 or 416.0 cents, two of the smaller size (829.7 cents)<br/>or one smaller and one larger (830.9 cents) come very close to 21/13<br/>(830.25 cents). The fifths at 703.125 and 704.297 cents are tempered<br/>gently wide, in good part to produce precisely this effect.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2010 6:14:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt;  I like the chord progression which is functional - especially @ 0.25/26</p><p>Dear Chris,</p><p>Thank you for your comments and especially for your focus on what from the timing is likely the final cadence of the piece. While my<br/>idea starting out was to use the steps and intervals of the Persian<br/>Shur Dastgah or modal family of Shur in a mostly three-voice texture<br/>influenced by 13th-century Western European polyphony, the result at<br/>times may be like a style of Georgian polyphony going back to at least<br/>the 12th century and still practiced by traditional musicians.</p><p>Please let me try to explain more about the final cadence and the<br/>tuning system, while emphasizing that this is very much a learning<br/>experience for me, and any further questions or comments you might<br/>have could help me in expressing concepts more clearly.</p><p>This piece uses 10 notes of the O3 temperament, a 24-note system made<br/>up of two 12-note chains of fifths, as I&apos;ll explain in responding to<br/>your question about the generators. While my note-naming scheme is<br/>based on the full 24-note system, there&apos;s no reason someone couldn&apos;t<br/>map the 10-note set for this piece to a single keyboard, for example,<br/>so the pitches and intervals in cents are more important. In the<br/>24-note scheme, C#* for example means &quot;C# on the upper chain,&quot; about<br/>57.4 cents higher than C#.</p><p>For the final cadence, I&apos;ll show pitches with respect to the 1/1 (A)<br/>by numbers following each note name; harmonic or vertical intervals<br/>above the lowest note of a chord by numbers in parentheses; and<br/>ascending or descending melodic intervals by positive or negative<br/>numbers. Values are generally rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent,<br/>with links to more precise Scala files at the end of this post.</p><p>To allow for Yahoogroups formatting quirks, I&apos;m also including a link<br/>to an ASCII version of this post on the web:</p><p>     C#*  472.3 ---- +230.9 ----   E   703.1<br/>   (704.3)                      (703.1)<br/>     Bb*  138.2 ---- -138.2 ----   A    0.0<br/>   (370.3)                       (0.0)<br/>     F#*  968.0 ---- +232.0 ----   A    0.0</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude-O3_generators.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude-O3_generators.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>In other words, the first chord of the cadence has a large neutral<br/>third at around 370 cents and a fifth at 704 cents. The outer voices<br/>ascend together by large whole tones of 231 or 232 cents, around 8:7,<br/>while the middle voice descends by a neutral second of 138 cents. The<br/>lower two voices thus arrive at a unison, and the upper voice at a<br/>fifth of 703 cents, the goal of the cadence. In this style, thirds and<br/>sixths are unstable intervals which often &quot;pull toward&quot; a stable<br/>sonority such as a simple fifth or a fifth plus octave, for example.</p><p>&gt; What are the generators for this tuning in cents (which is about all<br/>&gt; I grasp really well right now)</p><p>Apart from the 2/1 octave, the generators are chains of fifths at<br/>703.125 or 704.297 cents (600 or 601 steps of 1024-EDO), plus an<br/>interval of 57.422 cents (49 steps of 1024-EDO) defining the space<br/>between two 12-note chains.</p><p>The two chains are identically arranged as follows, with A on the<br/>lower chain as the 1/1 for this piece, and thus for the diagram.<br/>While only 10 notes are actually used for the piece, this is the<br/>bigger picture, with pitch locations in cents with respect to the 1/1<br/>shown below each note name on a chain, and fifth sizes in the spaces<br/>above and between the note names along a given chain.</p><p>   704.3   703.1 704.3 703.1  704.3 704.3 703.1 704.3 703.1  704.3  704.3<br/> Eb*-----Bb*----F*----C*-----G*----D*----A*----E*----B*----F#*----C#*----G# 634.0  138.2  841.4 345.7 1048.8 553.1  57.4 760.5 264.8  968.0 472.2 1176.6</p><p>   704.3   703.1 704.3 703.1  704.3 704.3 703.1 704.3 703.1  704.3  704.3<br/> Eb------Bb-----F-----C------G-----D-----A-----E-----B-----F#-----C#-----G# 576.5   80.9  784.0 288.3  991.4 495.7  0.0  703.1 207.4  910.5 414.8 1119.1</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude-O3_generators.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude-O3_generators.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>While these values should be accurate enough to give a good idea of<br/>the O3 system, here are Scala files for the complete O3 temperament;<br/>the ten-note set used for _Prelude in Shur for Erv Wilson_; and the<br/>&quot;Zalzalian 12&quot; set which includes these ten notes in the rotation<br/>making Scala step 7 (704.297 cents) the 1/1.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O3-24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O3-24.scl</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude_in_shur.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/prelude_in_shur.scl</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/O3-zalzalian12_D.scl">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/O3-zalzalian12_D.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  Thanks!<br/>&gt;  chris</p><p>Thank you in turn for your interest and encouragement,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2010 3:34:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Brava Margo- heavy metalers can hide their heads in shame, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; some some sonotities and movement of real ironclad chutzpah!
