Of course, it won&apos;t have 5-limit commas up the wazoo, and that singles this out among the rodan commas. Still, it has a TE badness figure which is fairly high, meaning there are lots of competing commas which might be of more interest. But don&apos;t let that stop you if you think it is interesting! The ampersand is not all that terrific but since miracle is terrific, it gets noticed, and one might just go ahead and list 5-limit commas of all kinds of notable rank two temperaments. But I am wondering what about it draws your interest.</p></div><h3>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2012 10:49:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any regular temperament with codimension greater than one will have arbitarily horrible commas, so this won&apos;t work as an argument.</p><p>Arbitrary horrible commas?
