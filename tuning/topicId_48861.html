There&apos;s no point in deliberately<br/>&gt; courting ambiguity in this way.</p><p>Whether Carl is courting ambiguity I can not judge.  For myself, I&apos;m just<br/>trying to learn the language, which involves recognizing the ambiguities.<br/>(I *may* be approaching this learning somewhat pig-headedly at the moment.)<br/>One person&apos;s perspective is not sufficient to establish a lack of ambiguity.<br/>It sounds as if you don&apos;t recognize Paul&apos;s perspective as being as real as<br/>yours in this.  The bodily sense of pig-headedness is something I actually<br/>do experience when reading your message but do not experience when reading<br/>Paul&apos;s and so I wonder whether this might be a projection on your part.<br/>This is of course my own projection but I offer it as a possible input in<br/>your quest for recognition of your own propensities of character.   ;)</p><p>In any case, I can not find a definition of &quot;N-limit consonance&quot; appearing<br/>anywhere in the monz dictionary, except possibly implied by definition 2 on<br/>the limit page.  So I want to know what this animal is.  The monz<br/>&quot;consonance&quot; page refers to &quot;interval&quot;.  While it does not equate a<br/>consonance to an interval, it defines conconance as a property of some<br/>intervals, or as something that may emerge in the experience of some<br/>intervals.  So I have no information that distinguishes the contextual<br/>implications of &quot;consonance&quot; versus &quot;interval&quot; in relation to &quot;N-limit&quot;.<br/>The only implicatory distinction I can find between &quot;consonance&quot; and<br/>&quot;interval&quot; is that &quot;consonance&quot; may involve a chord (multiple intervals).</p><p>I could try to extract a definition of &quot;N-limit consonance&quot; from definition<br/>2 on the limit page.  From reading this:</p><p>&gt; A chord in Just Intonation where all interval-ratios belong to the n-limit is<br/>&gt; said to be an &quot;n-limit&quot; chord. A composition or style where chords of the<br/>&gt; n-limit are considered consonant and chords of any higher limit are considered<br/>&gt; dissonant is said to be an &quot;n-limit&quot; composition or style.</p><p>I get an indication of a conceivable definition such as this:</p><p>N-limit consonance - A chord which is considered consonant in an N-limit<br/>composition.</p><p>But that is no different from an N-limit chord, and if the discussion is<br/>restricted to dyads, that is no different from an N-limit interval.  Thus I<br/>still can not distinguish an N-limit consonance from an N-limit interval.</p><p>I thought at one point that maybe &quot;N-limit consonance&quot; might be a way of<br/>referring to an idealized just entity considered to be &quot;behind&quot; an actual<br/>chord which is an approximation to such a consonance and which might be<br/>heard as &quot;referring&quot; to such a consonance.
