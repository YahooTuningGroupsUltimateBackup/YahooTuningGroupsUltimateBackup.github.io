Turns out all I need do is select, as the input to Sound Forge (or any recording app you might have on your computer, I imagine) the Microsoft Sound Mapper, and it will record what is going through my soundcard at the time - in this case, the streaming mp3. It is a piece of cake to listen to later, and one could encode it to save space if the program was worthy of hanging on to.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there is a simple way on Macs and *nix boxes as well...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2003 9:11:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Clarification:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Part 2 of the BBC Radio program is now available as mp3 for listeners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Get it from links at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>Aha! I misremembered the streaming from the BBC, which is in RealAudio format. What Charles has apparantly done is offer the programs in mp3 format, which may or may not bother the people at the Beeb. More to the point is he offers an edited version that only includes the interview with *him*.</p><p>I wondered what would have made Charles post so vigorously about something not connected with himself, and now I know the connection.</p><p>There you have it,<br/>Jon</p></div>
