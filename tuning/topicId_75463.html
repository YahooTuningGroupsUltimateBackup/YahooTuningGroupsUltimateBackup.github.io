I have been teaching microtonal music to  public<br/>school children all week.<br/>Tuning is indeed vast, or is it &quot;temperamenting?&quot;  While I could not  add to<br/>the discussion this past week, I feel strengthened in the belief that my<br/>instincts are correct.  I was hoping for just such a reaction.</p><p>&quot;Modified Meantone&quot; is for me a useless term.  It holds no valuable  context<br/>in my life&apos;s work of producing microtonal music, or in understanding  history.<br/> Sorry, realizing how other have invested heavily in it for one  reason or<br/>another.</p><p>The realization that Werckmeister III had no name in its inception is<br/>underscored by the variants in the present discussion regarding  terms, thanks to<br/>members of the List.</p><p>Rather than argue adverbs versus nouns, to the musical ear all is a  tuning.<br/>On the face of it, we experience music passively though our ears  as<br/>interpreted by our minds.  Temperament is &quot;tamperment&quot; in one  sense.  In another, the<br/>receiver (listener) embosses the  sensations with his or her own personality,<br/>or &quot;temperament,&quot; and emotional  mood.  Modifying anything, including<br/>meantone, cannot require the  severe requirements that you would impose on it because<br/>of your expertise  with hammering metal, for instance.  I suspect the world<br/>takes modifying in  a general sense, with little if any specifics.</p><p>While an adverb modified a verb on the title page of Werckmeister&apos;s  treatise<br/>on tuning (1691), the concept of doing this only makes sense as a  noun.</p><p>Paul:  Ultimately, though, I think it doesn&apos;t<br/>really matter as long  as we realize we are creating an approximation<br/>of an unreachable ideal, that  being the use of pure consonances for<br/>every triad.</p><p>Johnny:  Ah, but it is for J.S. Bach that I have centered my  focus.  J.S.<br/>Bach&apos;s music sucks in just intonation, as previously  discussed on this list.<br/>It is less musical in equal temperament than well  temperament, probably of any<br/>kind of well temperament.  To find the true  tuning of well temperament he<br/>used would not be about notes, but about  intervals, a seeming myriad of musical<br/>intervals.  Bach&apos;s music needs  temperament, almost as a raison d&apos;etre, but<br/>there has been a conspiracy to  limit his music to the modern hegemony of<br/>12-tone ET.  (Denial is a river  in Egypt.)  With no certainty as to which<br/>irregular well temperament  Bach used, I will present a case that WIII is the one to<br/>choose for modern  performance, and to better understand still another<br/>dimension in the music of  Bach.</p><p>A modern theory of moderns imposed on a baroque composing  sensation such as<br/>Bach punches a hole in the theory almost  immediately.  Quantz has no<br/>relevance here.</p><p>Paul: I think it is wrong to ask which specific system or which  specific<br/>tuning Werckeister had in mind as the starting point to deviate  from.</p><p>Johnny: And I would completely disagree.  There is strong preference  for<br/>Werckmeister III tuning over any of the other tunings,  period.  The 1681 first<br/>publication produces only 2 tuning  possibilities (tuning as a verb), both<br/>nameless.  The subtitle of Orgel  Probe (1681) has the tuning topic up front on<br/>the organ examination book.   Werckmeister was trying to slip his own tuning in<br/>past conservative clerics,  courts, the musicians, and those previously<br/>invested in a different  system.  He was under extreme criticism from the WIV<br/>people.  His  youngest son, who took over his former position in Quedlinburg<br/>actually retained  WIV tuning on the organ.</p><p>WIV was the status quo tuning used by Trost on the Halberstadt and<br/>Quedlinburg organs, where Werckmeister was later to work.  While WIV had no  name<br/>(though Trost tuning is appealing), it would become much later known as<br/>Werckmeister IV tuning.  (Perhaps the word &quot;tuning&quot; sounds more apealing to  American<br/>English ear than does the word &quot;temperament&quot;.)  There were no  other mentions of<br/>variants, nor is there much recognition of them in any of the  literature.</p><p>Regardless, as an accomplished and professional improviser Werckmeister<br/>required an organ tuning that played in a full circle of keys, and in  this<br/>Werckmeister III was superior to the older W IV.</p><p>Read this: Werckmeister wanted to replace Trost with his own circle.   This<br/>circle is definitive well temperament, at least in my book.  WIV would  be an<br/>irregular tuning in my book because a pro-irregular set of scales (as  opposed<br/>to meantone) was on the ground in Thuringia and neighboring  environs.  There<br/>was an aesthetic prevalent in central Germany that  loved that irregularity<br/>and has been ignored by those that favor the  sameness of the just intonation<br/>model, recognized instrumentally as  meantone.</p><p>To avoid misrepresenting you, I am retaining your comments below.  We  can<br/>keep different beliefs.  No one need change their position.  We  can only<br/>present and leave it to others to make their way.  In my work on  Bach&apos;s Tuning<br/>(much more preferable title to me than Bach&apos;s Temperament, and  which may be<br/>actually misleading in American English), there is no  meantone.  I believe there<br/>is a different aesthetic present in Bach&apos;s music  that is missed by the<br/>meantone model you promote, let alone any  ambiguous modified meantone model.  As you<br/>noted, Werckmeister  described the relative ease of retuning a meantone<br/>keyboard into WIII.</p><p>It has been wonderful having this spirited discussion.  The List is a<br/>wonderful place for getting perspective,</p><p>all best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>------------------------------------<br/>Paul: That&apos;s why I don&apos;t agree that a temperament is always  an<br/>approximation of some definite tuning. If pressed, I would have to  say<br/>that all traditional temperaments are approximations of  an<br/>unrestrained flexible 5-limit JI applied independently to each  and<br/>every harmony. And yes, that includes sequential harmonies  which<br/>contain common notes sustained from one harmony to the other and  which<br/>change function as the harmony changes, like a G# becoming an  Ab.<br/>These notes would have been altered slightly in pitch at the  moment<br/>the harmony changes, precisely as Quantz TELLS us to  do.</p><p>**************It&apos;s Tax Time!

And well said.<br/>Paul: The funny things  I can&apos;t wrap my head around in all this, are the<br/>following:</p><p>(a) If  Werckmeister (and his cirlce) was so enamored of WIII, then why<br/>on earth in  1698 did he recommend to the &quot;beginner&quot; that he use<br/>another entirely  different temperament that is actually MUCH more<br/>difficult to  set?<br/>Johnny: This is also  the year of the revised Orgel-Probe (1698) which now<br/>omitted the tuning info  from the first edition.  Erweiterte  und verbesserte<br/>Orgel-Probe (1698) points towards the earlier published  monochord treatise of<br/>Musicalische  Temperatur  (1691) with the following  direction:<br/>&quot;With regard to the matter of temperament,  there is no need to add anything<br/>in particular, since the kind reader can find a  detailed discussion and<br/>demonstration in our treatise on temperament with an  appendix on the monochord&quot;<br/>(Werckmeister, Orgel-Probe, p.  65).<br/>As to why he  recommended it to beginners, he must have thought that with the<br/>average of  beginner errors that are most likely, the tuning would be more<br/>acceptable with a  different set of goals. The 1698 you refer to is from<br/>Here&apos;s a bit I  have now about this; please let me know if you find anything<br/>factually  wrong:<br/>Another Werckmeister publication that contained important  tuning information<br/>came in the form of a 1698 essay entitled &ldquo;Short Lesson and  Addition, how<br/>one can tune and temper well a clavier.&rdquo;  It was added to &ldquo;Essential<br/>Annotations  and Rules Concerning the Proper Realization of the Basso Continuo or<br/>Thorough-Bass&rdquo; (Die nothwendigsten Ammerckungen und Regeln, wie der Bassus<br/>continuus oder General-Bass wohl k&ouml;nne tractiret warden).  Werckmeister directed this<br/>amendment  towards beginners in tacet recognition that organs will always<br/>need to be tuned  by trained professionals.  Werckmeister once again attempted to<br/>aid the more na&iuml;ve readers in the  actual tuning of a harpsichord.<br/>Throughout &ldquo;Essential Annotations&mldr;,&rdquo; Werckmeister invites  the reader to<br/>consult his copper-plate Monochordo contained in  Musicalische Temperatur to &ldquo;<br/>find more exact information throughout the  proportional numbers&rdquo; (Archambault,<br/>p. 225).  The title page of Musicalische  Temperatur hugely enlarged the word<br/>MONOCORDI so that the eye  quickly catches the second largest word, MONOCHORDO.<br/> This indicates that the copper-plate  comparison of tunings was the real<br/>draw for the purchase of the book.  For the more serious tuners in his  audience,<br/>it was imperative that the reader consult Musicalische  Temperatur (1691).<br/>Musical  Temperament or the clear  and authentic mathematical instruction of<br/>how, through the analysis of the  monochord, one can tune a keyboard<br/>instrument (especially organs, positives,  regals, spinets, and such) in a<br/>well-tempered manner, in order that according to  the practice of today, all modi ficti<br/>can be accepted in a pleasing and  tolerable harmony; with a preliminary<br/>perfection and lesser perfection of the  musical numbers, proportions, and consonants<br/>which in the process of setting up  the temperament, are to be seriously<br/>considered.  In addition, a monochord is depicted  distinctly and completely in a<br/>copper-plate (Hehr, p. 1).<br/>While Werckmeister did pay lip service to equal  temperament in some of his<br/>writings, he always stated his clear preference for  more consonance in the<br/>thirds of the diatonic keys; he always referred readers  back to Musicalische<br/>Temperatur (1691) for further information and  detail.  Upon examination, it<br/>seems  Werckmeister did not shift gears; there never was a paradigm shift.  He<br/>just wanted more customers available  by marketing equal temperament to eager<br/>newbies and curious amateurs.  It was never meant for &ldquo;haut  couture.&rdquo;</p><p>(b) What a vast  world of difference must live in 1/4 of the schisma,<br/>since he rants quite  forcefully that &quot;no healthy ear&quot; can withstand<br/>1/4 Syntonic comma tempered  fifths, recommending instead fifths<br/>tempered by only 1/8th to 1/12 comma (not  specifying which one).<br/>Funny, that.<br/>Johnny:  Here&apos;s a  nice quote about this.  Werckmeister appears more<br/>circumspect regarding the  influence of his personal taste on others.<br/>&ldquo;Indeed Werckmeister could  have written his 1698 defense of his new<br/>temperament with Buxtehude&rsquo;s music in  mind.&rdquo;  Andreas Werckmeister  wrote:<br/>Since through  the grace of God, music has so progressed and changed, it<br/>would be absurd if we  had not tried to improve the keyboard, so that<br/>well-composed modern pieces  should not be ruined, and a howl came out of them&mldr;Some would<br/>like to say that  one should not compose in every key, such as C#, F# and G#.<br/>But I say that if one does not do it,  another will&mldr;And why should I set<br/>limits for this person or that, and want to  prohibit him from composing in this<br/>key?...the free arts want free geniuses  (Werckmeister in Snyder re:<br/>Buxtgehude, p. 84).<br/>Where did you get your  quote?</p><p>Paul: I think he  just went bonkers in his old age.

He was simply an equal opportunity nice<br/>guy trying to  be okay with different fronts.  Sort of a John McCain type.

Snyder wrote:<br/>&ldquo;Indeed Werckmeister could have written his  1698 defense of his new<br/>temperament with Buxtehude&rsquo;s music in mind.&rdquo;  Andreas Werckmeister  wrote:<br/>Since through the  grace of God, music has so progressed and changed, it<br/>would be absurd if we had  not tried to improve the keyboard, so that<br/>well-composed modern pieces should  not be ruined, and a howl came out of them&mldr;Some would<br/>like to say that one  should not compose in every key, such as C#, F# and G#.<br/>But I say that if one does not do it,  another will&mldr;And why should I set<br/>limits for this person or that, and want to  prohibit him from composing in this<br/>key?...the free arts want free geniuses  (Werckmeister in Snyder re: Buxtehude,<br/>p.  84).</p><p>Paul: I think  he just went bonkers in his old age.

He<br/>kept letting in different  possibilities while maintaining that WIII was for<br/>the professionals.   Walther might have reported that there was a change in<br/>their relationship due to  dementia.
