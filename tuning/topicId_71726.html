So at least i should be able to answer your questions.<br/>:)</p><p>Let&apos;s see ...</p><p>&gt; On:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/h/hewm.aspx">http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/h/hewm.aspx</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/h/hewm.aspx">http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/h/hewm.aspx</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it seems to give the vector notation for each note name,<br/>&gt; and then accidentals up to and including 11-limit just<br/>&gt; symbols (I&apos;m not considering the tempered version). This<br/>&gt; all seems simple enough, but I have several questions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Does a list exist up to a much higher limit for this<br/>&gt; notation (preferably up to 61 limit, but I&apos;ll take what<br/>&gt; I can get).</p><p>No. I created HEWM specifically to notate 11-limit JI.</p><p>My webpage used to have a graphic showing Daniel Wolf&apos;s<br/>proposal for accidentals up to the 23-limit, and i&apos;ve<br/>just hunted that graphic down (thanks to the Wayback<br/>Machine at <a href="http://web.archive.org/">http://web.archive.org/</a> &lt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/">http://web.archive.org/</a>&gt; ) and added it back<br/>into my webpage. However, please read what follows below<br/>it, since Dr. Wolf has emphasized that he still supports<br/>the principles embodied in his version of the HEWM notation,<br/>but that he no longer supports all of the symbols exactly<br/>as he proposed them at that time.</p><p>The only unequivocal recommendation i can give for a<br/>better accurate notation for JI higher than 11-limit HEWM<br/>(or 23-limit HEWM if you accept Dr. Wolf&apos;s symbols)<br/>is Sagittal. See the Sagittal website:</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/</a> &lt;<a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/</a>&gt;</p><p>... in particular, the Xenharmonikon article describing<br/>it in detail:</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a> &lt;<a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Similarly, if an algorithm is used to generate<br/>&gt; any next symbol (like arrow, plus, or otherwise) and the<br/>&gt; vector in the series, that would also be sufficient.</p><p>The was no real algorithm involved in HEWM.<br/>My choice of symbols was dictated by:</p><p>3-limit: # and b from standard musical usage;</p><p>5-limit: + and - because they seemed to me to be<br/>best suited to the smallest amount of pitch inflection<br/>and also because 5-limit intervals are in some sense<br/>more &quot;basic&quot; and so i wanted the least intrusive symbols<br/>for them;</p><p>7-limit: &gt; and &lt; because they somewhat resemble the<br/>7 and inverted-7 used by Ben Johnston, and also because<br/>to me the mathematical ideas of &quot;greater than&quot; and<br/>&quot;less than&quot; seem to indicate something larger than<br/>&quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot;;</p><p>11-limit: ^ and v because they somewhat resemble the<br/>up and down arrows that have been used by several<br/>quartertone composers to represent the quartertone<br/>pitches, and also because they seem to me to be a<br/>rotation of the 7-limit symbols and by pointing up<br/>and down seem to indicate a still larger pitch inflection.</p><p>Again, i will refer you to Sagittal, for an example of<br/>a microtonal notation which *does* follow an algorithm.<br/>All the little hooks and barbs which make up the Sagittal<br/>arrows have specific pitch meanings, and their combinations<br/>follow rules according to the mathematics of the tunings.</p><p>Note that i highly recommend Sagittal, but that i still<br/>strongly support HEWM for 11-limit JI and even moreso<br/>in the tempered version for 72-edo, and with one additional<br/>symbol (suggested by Dan Stearns) for 144-edo; for this<br/>latter see:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/144edo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/144edo.aspx</a> &lt;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/144edo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/144edo.aspx</a>&gt;</p><p>One of the main reasons i like HEWM is its ease of use<br/>in ASCII email communication (like this post).</p><p>&gt; 2. Does a peer reviewed, academic, journal have a list<br/>&gt; such as that, on the above web page, published for any<br/>&gt; limit at all (up to 11 or higher)? I know journal papers<br/>&gt; such as this exist for the Ben Johnston notation, but<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t been able to find equivalent info for HEWM from<br/>&gt; an academic, peer reviewed, source. Any hints, if such<br/>&gt; a paper exists?</p><p>None that i know of. Johnston had a long career as a<br/>university professor, and his notation has had a strong<br/>influence on a lot of JI composers and theorists.<br/>All i have to promote my ideas is my website and these<br/>Yahoo groups, which both do the job to some extent, but<br/>it&apos;s not the kind of daily contact that a teacher has<br/>with his students for four years.</p><p>&gt; 3. For the 11 limit accidental in HEWM, are the ^ and v<br/>&gt; symbols supposed to indicate up and down arrows in an<br/>&gt; actual music score(I assume)?</p><p>Yes. I didn&apos;t actually say that above, but in my own<br/>scores i tend to add the stem to the arrow-head to make<br/>real arrows.</p><p>You can see examples of my own usage of 72-edo and<br/>144-edo HEWM in my handwritten sketch to my piece<br/>_A Noiseless Patient Spider_:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/spider/spider.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/spider/spider.htm</a> &lt;<a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/spider/spider.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/spider/spider.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a> &lt;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a>&gt;<br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=71728 href="#71728">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2007 10:05:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mohajeri,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mohajeri Shahin&quot; &lt;shahinm@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi monzo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as you have used HEWM for 31 and 41-EDO in<br/><a href="http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/c/canasta.aspx">http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/c/canasta.aspx</a><br/>&gt; i think it is also useful for 96-EDO because function<br/>&gt; of 12.5 is like 16.6666 to produce major third of near<br/>&gt; 5/4 and so:<br/>&gt; b    #       semitone      100<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; v    ^       1/4-tone       50<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;    &gt;       3/16-tone      37.5 (4.16666 greater than<br/>&gt; one degree of 72-EDO)</p><p>You mean two degrees of 72-edo.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ??????       1/8-tone       25<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -    +       1/16-tone      12.5 (4.16666 less than<br/>&gt; one degree of 72-EDO)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but may be ++ and --(or=) are useful for 25 cent so<br/>&gt; for 0 to 100cent we can have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 100     C#,Db<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 87.5    C#-,Db-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 75      C#--(or C#=),C&lt;+,Db--(orDb=),Db&lt;+<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 62.5    C#&lt;,Db&lt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 50      C^,C#v,Dbv<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 37.5    C&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 25      C++,C&gt;-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12.5    C+<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0       C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; what is your idea about 96 and HEWM?</p><p>It seems to me like trying to make a square peg<br/>fit into a round hole. 72-edo and 96-edo only<br/>have the quarter-tones and semitones in common,<br/>all the other degrees don&apos;t match.</p><p>Since i designed HEWM for JI, the + and - signs<br/>are meant to represent the syntonic-comma pitch<br/>inflection, ~21.5 cents.
