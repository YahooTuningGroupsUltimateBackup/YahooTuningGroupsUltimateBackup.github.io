I&apos;d like to clarify.</p><p>If you take a bunch of short samples of a typcial Barbershop song, you&apos;ll<br/>find a justly-tuned 7-limit chord most of the time.</p><p>This may not sound very strong, so let me be clear: Barbershop is the most<br/>consistent and deliberate higher-limit music I know of.  It is not some<br/>accidental, sometimes JI, sometimes 7-limit music.  It is an entire style<br/>firmly commited to the 7-limit.  Their theory is fully aware of the tuning<br/>issue, their mission statement contains reference to JI, and even amatur<br/>groups sing nicely in tune.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=246 href="#246">ðŸ”—</a>Dan Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/1999 10:16:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If you take a bunch of short samples of a typcial Barbershop song, you&apos;ll<br/>find a justly-tuned 7-limit chord most of the time.</p><p>Is this also the case melodically... or vertically (a justly-tuned 7-limit<br/>melody most of the time)?</p><p>&gt;It is not some accidental, sometimes JI, sometimes 7-limit music.  It is an<br/>entire style firmly commited to the 7-limit.</p><p>My (limited) understanding (or more likely lack thereof...) was that it was<br/>some sort of a (very interesting) conglomeration were the main tune (the<br/>melody) was (more or less) - as it were on the piano, and the &quot;chords&quot; were<br/>locked in (JI beatless) to that... ?</p><p>Whatever the case, I agree: It&apos;s a truly wonderful tradition and style.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
