Sorry I&apos;m so slow to re-populate my web site with new stuff, but<br/>as a long-term question, I ask both of you, and everyone else who&apos;s<br/>interested, does the new springy stuff, in fairly stiff version (r7 and<br/>r5), seem too tame?  I think it&apos;s pretty nice, not leaving too much<br/>lacking in tuning but definitely not so jumpy in transition as the 1999<br/>(&quot;pre-spring&quot;) tunings.  Yet, did I not once myself say I love to hear<br/>the tuning jump?  I seem to want to swing both ways...</p><p>(After listening to, and liking, the Bach/Busoni in COFT fixed tuning,<br/>I went back and listened to some fully bent (seven!) Brahms piano<br/>concertos.  Oh yeah!!!!).</p><p>The &quot;stir&quot;, BTW, was more over whether it was/is proper to bend the<br/>heck out of the works of composers long dead.  Some said no; I said,<br/>well, you can guess.  You didn&apos;t miss much...</p><p>Joseph, please don&apos;t waste your time in the ssss versions if your ear<br/>likes it stiffer and jumpier.  Clearly, some ears are sensitive, and<br/>the sss&apos;s are for them.  I&apos;m interested in knowing where the spectrum<br/>of ears falls in delight and irritation.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
