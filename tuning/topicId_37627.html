With electronic tuning<br/>technology, even acoustic instruments can be tuned with this accuracy<br/>and cumulative errors are not an issue with electronic tuning.</p><p>I challenge anyone to detect a one cent error even with unisons when<br/>the pitches are not simultaneous and there is a gap of over half a<br/>second between two consecutive pitches one cent apart. I can barely<br/>hear two cents under these conditions and wouldn&apos;t notice it if I<br/>weren&apos;t looking for it. If there are those who can meet this<br/>challenge successfully, they are so rare as to be insignificant in<br/>any practical musical scenario.</p><p>No one would be happier than I if such people abounded. I find my<br/>ears constantly assailed by tin-eared &quot;musicians&quot; who miss with<br/>pitches orders of magitude worse. They have, nevertheless, somehow<br/>been contracted to perform for classical recordings on well-known<br/>commercial labels.</p><p>So I would like to suggest that we have much bigger fires to fight<br/>than squabbling over errors under two cents. One of the main<br/>objections I hear to anything other than 12t-ET is that the<br/>differences between 12t-ET and JI are not practically significant.</p><p>This burns me, but squabbling over errors under two cents when they<br/>are not cumulative completely undermines any case we could make in<br/>answer to such stupidity and classifies us to the common practice<br/>world as anally afflicted theoretical nitpickers.  Moreover, during<br/>the infamous and strange Jerries experiments, I failed to see any<br/>evidence among those of us who participated that anything like this<br/>kind of aural acumen exists even among us microtonal enthusiasts.</p><p>And by the way, 612-EDO is incredibly accurate through 19-limit if we<br/>don&apos;t remain &quot;anal&quot; about very small errors that are still larger<br/>than &quot;a fifth of a cent&quot;.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;And to clarify what Gene was suggesting, 612-equal gives 5-limit<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt;to within a 20th of a cent and 9-limit to about a fifth of a<br/>cent.

We have a solution that allows this to be accomplished in two<br/>different ways:</p><p>1) Provision of symbols for rational intervals, independent of any<br/>division of the octave.  Inasmuch as the number of symbols in the<br/>notation is not infinite, it is conceivable that, using this<br/>approach, one could run out of symbols in some cases.</p><p>2) Provision of symbols for a large-numbered ET that would allow<br/>consistent and unique mapping of all 19-limit consonances.  This<br/>approach would guarantee that one would never run out of symbols, but<br/>it is possible that two different rational intervals might be notated<br/>the same way (although there are ways around this).</p><p>What it comes down to, then, is finding the ET of lowest number that:</p><p>1) Is 19-limit consistent;</p><p>2) Is 19-limit unique; and</p><p>3) Does not have an excessive error for any odd number in the 19<br/>limit.</p><p>For the 11 limit, the solution would be 72-ET.  For the 19 limit, the<br/>solution is 217-ET.  (193-ET comes close, but no cigar!)</p><p>There is a parallel between the two:  72 is 12 times 6; 72-ET is<br/>achievable with considerable pitch bending (up to 50 cents) on some<br/>12-ET instruments.  217 is 31 times 7; 217-ET would be achievable<br/>with a relatively small amount of pitch bending (up to ~17 cents) on<br/>31-ET instruments, should they be constructed.</p><p>The maximum deviation for 19-limit consonances in 217-ET is ~2.76<br/>cents, with the typical deviation around half of that.  Some<br/>(including myself) will find this acceptable; some will not.  (I<br/>prefer not to argue the point; there is also the rational notation<br/>approach for those who demand greater precision.)</p><p>The bottom line is that 217-ET does offer a framework such as you<br/>desire for conceptualizing 19-limit intervals that could ultimately<br/>find a way into practical usage via future 31-ET instruments.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38196 href="#38196">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2002 9:32:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m not sure you ever saw this, Johnny, so I&apos;ve edited and added to<br/>it and am sending it directly to you as well as reposting it on the<br/>tuning list.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>Johnny R.:<br/>&gt; &gt; As for compositional reasons, I&apos;m not sure I understand you.

So in the<br/>case of JI, I&apos;m not so interested in composition that is purely<br/>intellectually crafted work, hopefully with some feeling and<br/>spontaneity in the background to drive it. I would rather have a<br/>certain sense of fluidity in the compositional process that would<br/>increase the spontaneous, directly, interactively and musically<br/>inspired component.</p></div>
