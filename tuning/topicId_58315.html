They concern the spirit of the thing.<br/>(Funny, I had thought it might have related to a &quot;cord&quot; or<br/>string, as in eg a monochord, but I guess that &quot;cord&quot; comes<br/>from Greek &quot;chordos&quot; and is not related to Latin &quot;cors&quot;.)</p><p>However, all the words like assonance, consonance and<br/>dissonance stem from the verb &quot;sonare&quot;, to sound, and its<br/>relatives.  A &quot;consonant&quot; was that which was &quot;sounded with&quot;<br/>a vowel (note - not quite simultaneously; before or after).<br/>An &quot;assonance&quot; is a partial rhyme scheme in which only<br/>vowels, but not consonants, (eg, &quot;brave rain&quot;) sound alike.</p><p>Although some of the &quot;sonance&quot; terms have secondary<br/>meanings which equate to &quot;cordance&quot; terms used musically,<br/>this is not their primary meaning, either according to the<br/>dictionary&apos;s listing or according to their linguistic origin.</p><p>Concordant with their origins, the words in &quot;-cordance&quot;<br/>all carry strong meanings of musical [dis-]agreement, both<br/>according to the dictionary&apos;s listing and according to their<br/>linguistic origins.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that most of these words existed in Latin,<br/>and have come down to us through Old French and Middle<br/>English.

This relation is called _Dissonance_.</p><p>But there are certain determinate ratios between pitch<br/>numbers, for which this rule suffers an exception , and either<br/>no beats at all are formed, or at least only such as have so<br/>little intensity that they produce no unpleasant disturbance<br/>of the united sound.  These exceptional cases are called<br/>_Consonances_. ... &quot;</p><p>(Page 211)<br/>&quot;Chapter XII - Degree of Harmoniousness of Consonances:<br/> We have hitherto examined the effect of sounding together<br/>only two tones which form a determinate interval.  It is now<br/>easy to discover what will happen when more than two tones<br/>are combined.  The simultaneous production of more than two<br/>separate compound tones is called a _chord_.  We will first<br/>examine the harmoniousness of chords in the same sense as<br/>we examined the harmoniousness of any two tones sounded<br/>together.  That is, we shall in this section deal exclusively<br/>with the isolated effect of the chord in question, quite<br/>independently of any musical connection, mode, key,<br/>modulation and so on.  The first problem is to determine<br/>_under what conditions chords are consonant_, in which case<br/>they are termed _concords_.  It is quite clear that the first<br/>condition of a concord is that each tone of it should form a<br/>consonance with each of the other tones ... If this is the case<br/>each one of the three tones forms a consonant interval with<br/>each one of the other two, and the chord is consonant, or is<br/>a concord.&quot;</p><p>[Yahya again]<br/>So, Monz, I&apos;d say that your usage of the last few years is<br/>directly at odds with Helmholtz and Ellis and all those who<br/>have studied in their tradition.</p><p>Mind you - since we seem to be playing poker now - I&apos;d say<br/>a Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;nberg beats a Helmholtz any time (who cares what<br/>theoreticians say, if there&apos;s a REAL musician in the house?<br/>:-) ) - so -</p><p>Does anyone have &quot;HarmonieLehre&quot; ready to hand, to see<br/>how Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;nberg used the &quot;sonance&quot; and &quot;cordance&quot; terms?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.10.4 - Release Date: 27/4/05</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2005 1:00:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Yahya,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snipped quotes from Helmholtz&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Yahya again]<br/>&gt; So, Monz, I&apos;d say that your usage of the last few years is<br/>&gt; directly at odds with Helmholtz and Ellis and all those who<br/>&gt; have studied in their tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mind you - since we seem to be playing poker now - I&apos;d say<br/>&gt; a Sch&ouml;nberg beats a Helmholtz any time (who cares what<br/>&gt; theoreticians say, if there&apos;s a REAL musician in the house?<br/>&gt; :-) ) - so -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone have &quot;HarmonieLehre&quot; ready to hand, to see<br/>&gt; how Sch&ouml;nberg used the &quot;sonance&quot; and &quot;cordance&quot; terms?</p><p>Schoenberg didn&apos;t write anything about &quot;-cordance&quot;, AFAIK.<br/>he always spoke of &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;dissonance&quot;.</p><p>as i just pointed out in a recent post, i think it was<br/>a big disadvantage that he never produce a single term<br/>(&quot;sonance&quot;) to represent the whole continuum of perception<br/>of this quality, since he emphasized strongly in<br/>_Harmonielehre_ that there is no clear distinction<br/>between the two, and that they are merely the extreme<br/>ends of the continuum.</p><p>i don&apos;t know how far back in history this idea goes,<br/>but Helmholtz was certainly walking down that path.<br/>his &quot;degree of harmoniousness of consonances&quot; sets up<br/>a measure which expresses a continuum of perception<br/>as opposed to a sharp distinction.

I mean that seriously, this is well-thought out.<br/>Most of the arts went through some pretty ugly stuff through the 20th<br/>Century.  Music is far from the only field where artists wanted to<br/>violate the rules.  I think most Cubism and Dadaism is ugly, as well<br/>as a good deal of German Expressionism and Abstract Expressionism.<br/>Beckett is ugly, and Apollinaire too.  Outside of 12-tone music,<br/>Varese, Stravinsky, and Schoenberg himself were making some ugly music<br/>already.  George Crumb has made some of the ugliest stuff I&apos;ve ever heard.</p><p>Maybe computers were a big incentive to end the ugliness?  Suddenly<br/>it&apos;s easier to have everything line up perfectly than to have things<br/>appear haphazard.  Lots of 80&apos;s music is far less ugly than<br/>Schoenberg, but just as hard to take.  There is plenty of disruptive,<br/>hideous stuff done with computers today, but it takes extra effort.</p><p>-Chuckk</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2005 2:54:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Chuckk,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chuckk Hubbard&quot; &lt;BadMuthaHubbard@h...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Schoenberg brought one thing<br/>&gt; to the table that inspired<br/>&gt; thousands of terrible imitations<br/>&gt; and a few decent ones.

This is why he has referred to himself as a Yasserian, since he says he learned to view it this way from him, ( though he comes to different conclusions) . Just as a plant will put on a series of branches to fill in the gaps to capture light , scales do likewise when developing or evolving into smaller subdivisions. Hence when he would first have me rotate a scale  through a cycle of fifths ( in a variety of different ways) or investigate the subsets of a scale via the same approach. it seemed more organic. i should mention that this approach really gives one a good idea of what a scale is and can do.  it is one thing to look at a 12 tone scale for instance in terms of ratios from a given point, but to understand it how it can work musically ( on it most archetypal level) it is important to run through all your 5 and 7 tones scales and see and hear how they transform through these common tone modulations ( common ton in the sense usually only one tone is changed going from one scale to another.)</p><p>   As i have mentioned that Helmholtz&apos;s system is my own basis of measuring con/dis. by the addition of primary and difference tones omitting the repeated numbers. I composed a series of lullabies based on this idea which i have up on my personal pages on my site.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;one of the main things that fascinates me about musical tunings<br/>&gt;is how the data pops up in other places.
