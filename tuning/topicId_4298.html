of mathematics like Leonard Moser, Vladimir Arnold, Donald E Knuth,<br/>for fear of looking foolish, and its really not as if they would have time<br/>for me, being perhaps way, WAY too advanced.</p><p>I have a formula called &quot;Catalan&apos;s number&quot;, which assumedly, &quot;spits out&quot; the<br/>number of bracket scatterings for non-commutative and non-associative<br/>superpowers, but makes no assumption as to a GENERAL FORMULAE for this<br/>operators rules, when they are &quot;exponentiated&quot;, (is this the pronounciation)?</p><p>Thus, needs want to make a &quot;semantic/nomenclature system&quot; for the mutated<br/>Caltlan chain, the absolute and relative magnitude in relation to its<br/>&quot;cousin chains&quot;, and general rules for quiggle multiplying/powers/roots/logs.</p><p>I have also had a whack at graphing positive integers of these superpowers,<br/>but I am stumped when it comes to making superpowers of fractions, rational<br/>ratios, or irrationals for that matter, and I have had many a tortured<br/>night&apos;s sleep dreaming about superpowers, in relation to weight training,<br/>sex, drug interactions, AI, materials science, and number theory.</p><p>It may not be inherantly correct to simply state, for example that anything<br/>quiggle/superpower a negative is the same as anything superpower a positive,<br/>taking the absolute value, and &quot;negativiseing it&quot;.</p><p>And, since I do not have a general law for superpower exponents,<br/>multiplication, I can&apos;t really give the &quot;bull&apos;s charge&quot;, and just define:</p><p>n&amp;-p = 1/(n&amp;p), now can I?</p><p>Please can you also provide a layman&apos;s description of what an imaginary<br/>exponent would give?</p><p>Sure, I know that there is such a thing as &quot;DeMoivre&apos;s theorem&quot;, which gives<br/>us what these would be, for sure, however, I tryed a different attack, and<br/>assummed:</p><p>i * i = (-1^(1/2))*(-1^(1/2))=</p><p>-1^1 = -1 which, according to &quot;Betty&quot; my scientific calculator is correct,<br/>however, is it logically consistant and correct to assumme:</p><p>i ^ i = (-1^(1/2))^(-1^(1/2)) = (-1^(1/2))^i = -1^(i/2) = ?????</p><p>Is it logically consistant to &quot;look at the Madusis&quot; this way, with out<br/>turning to a methphorical stone statue?</p><p>(Probably a lot better off, actually, if this way...</p><p>:o) )</p><p>There were two proofs provided of DeMoivre&apos;s theorem, and they assummed<br/>quite a bit of rudimentary knowledge of linear algebra, which very probably<br/>wouldn&apos;t be explained in layman&apos;s terms, anyway, in one of those GIGANTIC<br/>algebra Univsrsity/College texts.</p><p>I have looked throught them, a few times, MacLauren&apos;s theorem, and work by<br/>Euler, and it&apos;s all just &quot;poped into place&quot;.</p><p>However, I would VERY much like to know the propertys of hypercomplex<br/>numbers (aka Hamilton&apos;s quarternions&quot; power and quiggle each other, with<br/>their non-commutative but still associative propertys.</p><p>Also, I have checked Caley algebra (octernions) out, and I have been told<br/>that 16onions, or hyper-hyper-hyper-complex numbers CANNOT exist, in a<br/>truely mathematically defined sence, at least!</p><p>Is this true?</p><p>Also, what would a matrix power a matrix, and a matrix superpower a matrix be?</p><p>So, what&apos;s a poor guy to do????</p><p>I have been experimenting with the effects of putting 0 to a superpower<br/>operator, in various positions of the superpower stack, and any one other<br/>than ......x^(x^(x^0)) gives the xth root of x, by merit of logic.</p><p>Else the identity is merely 1.</p><p>I have not the time, or the mathematical insight to proove superpowers of<br/>imaginarys and complex numbers, but I certainly need this knowledge, for<br/>possible creative application to superpower temperaments.</p><p>It may be a fools paradise in trying to make, or force a logical connection<br/>from *---&gt;^, to find ^----&gt;&amp;, or &quot;Superpowers/quiggle&quot;.</p><p>It should be stated here that exponent operation has non-commutative and<br/>non-associative propertys, something which I have seen quasi-inherant by<br/>matrix multiplication.</p><p>Thus a^b =/= b^a, and (a^b)^c =/= a^(b^c) in most cases, but not always.</p><p>Knowing that there is no formula, for generateing pure prime numbers, then<br/>assumedly, we will never have a formulae for generateing superpowers of<br/>every placement given by Catalan&apos;s number.</p><p>For example, even if we ALWAYS define superpower, and thus tower exponent<br/>stacks from the TOP, DOWN, we could, in theory have a tower exponent stack<br/>like this:</p><p>                &lt;---- &amp;7            &amp;5            &amp;3     &amp;2<br/>                   .........(x^(x^(x^(x^x))))^(x^(x^x))^(x^x),</p><p>Then how can we get a general formulae for n, in:</p><p>Catalan number Cn = (2n)!/((n!)(n+1)!)?</p><p>Am I making sence?</p><p>I am, or WAS, rather, looking for nothing less, than a GENERAL FORMULA for<br/>predicting EACH and EVERY value, &quot;spat out&quot; from a superpower<br/>operator/exponent tower, for EACH and EVERY legal placement of parenthesis &quot;}&quot;.</p><p>Now this seems just a tad unrealistic......</p><p>I have SOME idea as to x&amp;3.5, and also mabey a possible application for a<br/>&quot;superpower base computer&quot;, mabey necessecary for when quantum computers are<br/>realized........</p><p>Numbers here, so big, that we&apos;d need new glyphs to contain them all, still,<br/>needs want, as, and if the human race survives and evolves, but this seems<br/>unlikely.</p><p>As a final not, I met a gentleman called Warren Burt, and we had coffee with<br/>him (&quot;we&quot;=Alen wells and I).</p><p>A simply charming fellow, very intelligent, very creative.</p><p>He has assigned me homework, which is still to do.</p><p>Stay in touch,</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Sarn Richard Ursell.</p></div><h3><a id=4318 href="#4318">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
