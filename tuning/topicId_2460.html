My reasons for centering on 12-tET have largely to do with<br/>my desire to retrofit existing 12-tET pieces to adaptive JI without<br/>worrying about the Pythagorean comma where flat meets sharp.  If one is<br/>composing new music, that approximation is not necessary or desirable.</p><p>&gt; I would take all the &quot;pains&quot; you listed and add the &quot;pain&quot; of not<br/>&gt; having simultaneities in JI, which would have to be balanced<br/>&gt; against all the other pains.</p><p>That IS one of my &quot;pains&quot;, the pain of not being tuned correctly:</p><p>[Me, td145:]<br/>&gt;&gt; In my (as yet unwritten) leisure retuning software I intend to pay<br/>&gt;&gt; more strict attention to retune motion, and to &quot;drift&quot; the average<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning center as best suits the piece on the fly, attempting to<br/>&gt;&gt; balance the pain of drift vs. the pain of retune motion (also vs.<br/>&gt;&gt; pain of chords that for one reason or another can&apos;t be fully JI<br/>&gt;&gt; tuned).</p><p>We are talking about the same thing, yes?</p><p>[Paul/Brett:]<br/>&gt; In addition, I think truly exact JI is painful due to potential<br/>&gt; frequency cancellations, but that&apos;s rarely a concern with current<br/>&gt; equipment (which rarely achieves truly exact JI anyway).</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve never experienced the &quot;pain&quot; of having a chord too well<br/>tuned!  I do believe that it is mathematically possible to get a<br/>phase-lock that cancels part of the sound, and if that DID happen, I<br/>agree that a slight deviation from absolutely perfect JI should be<br/>introduced, to make the phases of the components shift about slowly.</p><p>By the way, am I mis-remembering, or did Paul Erlich post a reply to<br/>Brett Barbaro a few digests ago?

What falls out is an exponential decay toward perfect<br/>JI.  It gets very close in a fraction of a second with a reasonable set<br/>of coefficients, so the difference between that &quot;never quite&quot; motion and<br/>a linear transition to perfect JI is probably academic rather than<br/>audible.  As we have already discussed, the last tiny bit (1 or 2 cents,<br/>say) is of little significance to the ear, and may even be beneficial.</p><p>What IS significant is the decision of whether to retune a fast passage<br/>or let it go in a consistent tuning that is not ideally suited to the<br/>chords in passing.  That decision depends, of course, on the details of<br/>the sequence being considered, and on the tastes of a particular ear.<br/>By providing adjustable coefficients (for example, by bumping the pain<br/>of retune motion to infinite, one forces a fixed tuning of some sort,<br/>at least while notes are sounding), I hope to write a leisure retune<br/>program that will accommodate many tastes.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=2537 href="#2537">ðŸ”—</a>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>4/24/1999 5:20:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Always interested in *your* feedback, Paul/Brett.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stop that!
