I&apos;m not sure whether yours can be identified by the number of tubes alone.  I don&apos;t recall that any have as many as ten tubes, so your set may have been restrung by a prior owner.  You can probably determine the approximate ratios by comparison with an equal tempered instrument such as a piano if you don&apos;t have a frequency counter, assuming that you have any reference to a source of approximate ratio equivalents.  Most texts covering scales include some discussion of Pythagorean tuning and its relation to equal temperament, and give some ratios.<br/>Referring to your other message about just intonation math, I would recommend that you consult a copy of Harry Partch&apos;s &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot;.  The second, revised edition is available in paperback.</p></div>
