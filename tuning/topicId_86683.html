Start with one of these septad scales:</p><p>a. Diatonic<br/>b. Melodic Minor<br/>c. Harmonic Major<br/>d. Harmonic Minor<br/>e. Hungarian</p><p>2. Alter one pitch (or choose not to)<br/>3. Apply the M5 transform (or choose not to)</p><p>M5 is when you hold even pitches fixed and transpose odd ones by a tritone.</p><p>This will cover all septads, (and subsequently hexads, pentads, etc.)</p><p>One could tighten this up a bit and find just enough to cover<br/>hexad-partitions (a hexad and/or it&apos;s complement, which might be a<br/>Z-related pair) and then by subset and complementation, pentad-septads,<br/>tetrad-octads, triad-nonads, dyad-dodecad, monad-modecad, null-dodecad<br/>(empty set/whole collection)</p><p>In my grid 110209.xls which I posted on tuning-math Files I found<br/>that there is a pattern to where hexachord complements land.<br/>In fact every &quot;block&quot; will contain (at least the first four columns)<br/>a hexad, it&apos;s M5 complement, it&apos;s regular complement (also inverted)<br/>and the M5 of this.</p><p>PGH</p></div>
