The smaller 33:28<br/>(284.45 cents) and larger 13:11 (289.21 cents) differ by the<br/>364:363 kleisma at 4.76 cents.</p><p>In my 24-note regular tuning, placed on two 12-note keyboards at<br/>a diesis of about 55.28 cents apart, shown in the following<br/>notation by an asterisk (*) for notes on the higher keyboard,<br/>we get this approximation, here with A as the 1/1:</p><p>              A        B*       D*       F*<br/>              0       264      551      837<br/>                 264      286      286</p><p>Here, the 7/6 is slightly narrow at 264.50 cents, while either<br/>33:28 or 13:11 is represented by a regular minor third at 286.18<br/>cents. The smaller Zalzalian or neutral sixth at 837 cents is<br/>about 3.67 cents narrow of 13:8, and curiously almost the same<br/>amount wide of the transcendent Phi (833.09 cents), that epitome<br/>of complex assonance. Possibly &quot;a tempered 13:8 with a touch of<br/>complexity&quot; is one description.</p><p>For a Scala file of the 24-note regular temperament, see<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/eb24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/eb24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>----------------------------<br/>1. Journey to &quot;Sazkar Jadid&quot;<br/>----------------------------</p><p>Now for the main question: how might the steps of this intriguing<br/>structure be used in maqam music? The solution that occurred to<br/>me is a variation on Maqam Sazkar. The ascending form of the basic<br/>maqam is as follows:</p><p>                 Sazkar Jadid     tone       Bayyati<br/>            |-------------------|......|-----------------|<br/>            A      B*    C*     D      E     F*   F#*    A<br/>cents       0     264   341    495    705   837   969   1200 JI approx  1/1    7/6  39/32   4/3    3/2   13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>              264    77     154    209   132   132   231<br/>              7:6 117:112 128:117  9:8  13:12  14:13 8:7</p><p>This form draws on two beautiful JI tunings of the renowned<br/>11th-century philosopher and music theorist Ibn Sina. His noble<br/>tuning known as Mustaqim (which in Arabic, like Rast in Persian,<br/>means &quot;right, correct, standard&quot;) features a tetrachord of<br/>1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3 or 0-204-342-498 cents (204-139-155 cents).<br/>Here there is a tone or major second, followed by two Zalazalian<br/>or neutral second steps, with the first (13:12, 139 cents)<br/>smaller than the second (128:117, 155 cents). In the Arab world<br/>today, this pattern is sometimes as &quot;Rast Jadid&quot; or &quot;New Rast,&quot;<br/>in contrast to a more usual Rast where the larger Zalzalian<br/>second precedes the smaller.</p><p>In Sazkar, the first interval of a Rast tetrachord at a major<br/>second is replaced by the striking leap of a minor third -- here<br/>the 7:6. Thus we have 0-264-341-495 cents, or 264-77-154 cents.<br/>The small middle interval is here our regular minor second or<br/>limma at 77 cents -- but with the quite extraordinary effect this<br/>step has in the context of Sazkar, or Sazkar Jadid as I term this<br/>variation.</p><p>The upper tetrachord (E-A) features another of Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>tunings, in a just form a tetrachord sometimes read as either<br/>28:26;24:21 or 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3 (0-128-267-498 cents), with 7:6<br/>divided arithmetically into 14:13:12; or 12:13:14:16,<br/>1/1-13/12-7/6-4/3 (0-139-267-498 cents), with 7:6 divided<br/>harmonically into 12:13:14. Either form is represented by a<br/>tempered 0-132-264-495 cents (132-132-231 cents),</p><p>While I find this approximation satisfactory, it illustrates a<br/>form of &quot;intonational color-blindness&quot; to which this temperament<br/>is subject, losing the fine distinction between 14:13 and 13:12.</p><p>The descending form brings into play the 11/8, and also a<br/>cadential step a larger neutral second below the final:</p><p>           G*    A      B*    C*     D*     E     F*   F#*    A<br/>cents    -154    0     264   341    551    705   837   969   1200 JI approx 11/12 1/1    7/6  39/32   11/8   3/2   13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>              154  267    77     209    154    132   132   231<br/>             12:11 7:6 117:112  44:39  12:11  13:12 14:13  8:7</p><p>The D* or virtually just 11/8 is to me a kind of &quot;mirror<br/>reflection&quot; of the koron or lowered version of the fifth often used in Shur Dastgah when one descends toward the final:<br/>here, instead, the fourth is raised, so that in a Persian manner we might term D* a sori, or D&gt;.</p><p>Somehow the contour of the ascending tetrachord A-B*-C*-D, or<br/>the descending pentachord leading to the final, E-D*-C*-B*-A,<br/>seems &quot;jazzy&quot; or &quot;Bluesy&quot; to me, possibly because of the<br/>junxtaposition of a septimal minor third and Zalzalian or neutral<br/>third above the final. How it would sound to a Near Eastern<br/>musician familiar with Sazkar, I am not sure.</p><p>If one wishes to develop this maqam while keeping within its<br/>basic structure, one possibility would be to focus on a third<br/>tetrachord revealed if we move from a septimal minor seventh at<br/>969 cents (F#*) to a regular minor seventh at 991 cents (G):</p><p>                 Sazkar Jadid     tone       Bayyati<br/>            |-------------------|......|-----------------|<br/>                                       Mustaqim<br/>                                |------------------|<br/>            A      B*    C*     D      E     F*    G     A<br/>cents       0     264   341    495    705   837   991   1200 17-steps    0      4-    5s     7      10   12s   14    17<br/>JI approx  1/1    7/6  39/32   4/3    3/2   13/8 39:22  2/1<br/>              267    77     154    209   132   154   209<br/>               4-    1       2L     3     2s    2L    3<br/>              7:6 117:112 128:117  9:8  13:12 12:11 44:39</p><p>Here we can follow our ascending Sazkar (or Sazkar Jadid) with a<br/>conjunct tetrachord of Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim at a tempered<br/>0-209-341-495 cents or 209-132-154 cents.

Analysis and modulation: Enter Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While Sazkar Jadid was taking shape for me in its ascending and<br/>descending forms, I realized that the Sazkar Jadid tetrachord<br/>could lead to an interesting analysis if viewed in JI terms as<br/>follows:</p><p>              A       B*   C*     D<br/>tempered:     0      264  341    495<br/>                 264    77    154</p><p>JI:          1/1     7/6  11/9  4/3<br/>              0      267  347   498<br/>                 7:6   22:21 12:11<br/>                 267    81    151</p><p>While a reader might rightly call attention to the rather<br/>inaccurate representation of 11:9 in this temperament, which<br/>indeed is much closer to 28:23 or 39:32, our main interest here<br/>is in the adjacent intervals of 7:6, 22:21, and 12:11 (at<br/>267-81-151 cents).</p><p>These are, of course, the steps of Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Chromatic<br/>(22:21-12:11-7:6), famously permuted around 1300 by Qutb al-Din<br/>al-Shirazi in a classic form of Hijaz, which John Chalmers has<br/>temred &quot;neo-chromatic&quot; because of the placement of the large step<br/>in the middle:</p><p>              1/1   12/11     14/11  4/3<br/>               0     151       418   498<br/>                 12:11    7:6    22:21<br/>                  151     267      81</p><p>               G*     A         B*    C*<br/>               0     154       418   495<br/>                 154      264      77</p><p>Thus my discovery or rediscovery of &quot;Sazkar Jadid&quot; could be taken<br/>as a demonstrating a permutation of Qutb al-Din&apos;s Hijaz -- in<br/>turn, a permutation of Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Diatonic!</p><p>In fact, as shown by my tempered example for Qutb al-Din&apos;s<br/>tetrachord, this theoretical model leads to an interesting<br/>modulation, moving from my descending form of Sazkar Jadid to a<br/>usual Hijaz on G*:</p><p>                  Hijaz<br/>           |------------------|<br/>           G*    A      B*    C*     D*     E     F*   F#*    A<br/>cents    -154    0     264   341    551    705   837   969   1200 JI approx 11/12 1/1    7/6  39/32   11/8   3/2   13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>              154  267    77     209    154    132   132   231<br/>               2L   4-    1       3      2L     2s    2s    3+<br/>             12:11 7:6 117:112  44:39  12:11 13:12  14:13 8:7</p><p>Once we establish a focus on this Hijaz tetrachord (G*-C*), the<br/>maqam we have shifted into might take shape like this:</p><p>                  Hijaz               Rast         tone<br/>           |------------------|------------------|......|<br/>           G*    A       B*   C*    D*     E     F*     G*<br/>                                           Huseyni<br/>                                    |-------------------|<br/>cents      0    154     418  495   705    859   991    1200 JI approx 1/1  12/11   14/11 4/3   3/2   64/39 39/22   2/1<br/>             154    264    77   209   154    132    209<br/>            12:11   7:6   22:21 9:8 128:117 13:12  44:39</p><p>In its ascending form, this usual version of Maqam Hijaz (usual<br/>to me in this temperament, that is) has conjunct Hijaz and Rast<br/>tetrachords, the latter in one shading of the usual Arab pattern<br/>with the larger neutral second preceding the smaller (here<br/>0-209-363-495 cents or 209-154-132 cents). In descending, the<br/>larger Zalzalian sixth at 859 cents (near 23/14 or 64/39), found<br/>at E*, might be inflected to a minor sixth at Eb or 782 cents,<br/>very close to a just 11/7. Some styles might favor one version or<br/>the other of this sixth degree, with others fluidly alternating<br/>between them.</p><p>The version with the Zalzalian sixth also has an upper tetrachord<br/>D*-E-F*-G* at 0-154-286-495 cents or 154-132-209 cents which I<br/>here call Huseyni, since the order of the larger Zalzalian second<br/>followed by the smaller is more typical of Maqam Huseyni than of<br/>Maqam Bayyati, in this tuning often 132-154-209 cents. However,<br/>the term &quot;Bayyati&quot; is often applied in Arab theory to either<br/>arrangement, the general concept being simply two Zalzalian<br/>seconds followed by a tone (or 3-3-4 in a usual 24-step<br/>notation).</p><p>From this Maqam Hijaz on G* we might easily proceed to related<br/>destinations such as, in my style, Rast and related forms on G*.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. The 1/1-7/6-11/8-13/8 chord: resolutions and modulations -----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While the Sazkar Jadid introduces the notes of the chord, how<br/>might it be resolved in the context of what I shall term<br/>Zalzalian polyphony, or the application of polyphonic techniques<br/>to music drawing on the maqam and dastgah traditions, however<br/>closely or loosely.</p><p>In such a polytphonic style, a given vertical progression may<br/>serve either to realize the qualities of a given maqam or gusheh<br/>(i.e. a melodic theme or mode within the larger modal family of a<br/>dastgah), or to move from one such maqam or gusheh to another,<br/>possibly as part of a more or less standard modulatory scheme.<br/>Two possible modulations using 1/1-7/6-11/8-13/8 occurred to me.</p><p>The first is as follows, with the tempered chord at 0-264-551-705<br/>cents, and the expanding resolution arriving at a tempered 2:3:4.</p><p>       F*  +154  G<br/>       D*   -55  D<br/>       B*  +231  D<br/>       A   -209  G</p><p>Here the expansions of the lower ~7:6 minor third to a fifth, and<br/>of the outer ~13:8 Zalzalian sixth to an octave, are quite<br/>routine in this type of neomedieval style (the &quot;neomedieval&quot;<br/>referring both to the Near Eastern tunings and 13th-14th century<br/>European polyphonic techniques which here have a &quot;fusion&quot; in the<br/>setting of a 21st-century temperament). The ~33:28 minor third<br/>between the two middle voices likewise has a usual resolution<br/>contracting to a unison, with melodic steps of 231 and 55 cents<br/>that might represent the 8:7 and 28:27 steps of the Archytas<br/>Diatonic.

From the viewpoint of polyphonic technique, these two<br/>resolutions of A-B*-D*-F*, showing how a Zalzalian sixth can<br/>either expand to an octave, or less &quot;classically&quot; contract to a<br/>fifth, might recall the discussion by Marchettus of Padua (1317)<br/>about how a major sixth typically expands to an octave, but<br/>through a &quot;feigned&quot; inflection or cadence can also contract to a<br/>fifth! In a 17-note system, or a larger system like this<br/>featuring most similar types of intervals, a Zalzalian seventh<br/>similarly may contract &quot;classically&quot; to a fifth (7-5), or<br/>strikingly expand to an octave, with George Secor educating me on<br/>the latter choice in the setting of his 17-tone well-temperament<br/>(17-WT). To take simple two-voice example, the small Zalzalian<br/>seventh or augmented sixth Eb-C# at 1046 cents or ~11:6 might<br/>resolve either by contracting to E-B (7-5) or expanding to the<br/>octave D-D. In a Near Eastern context, the first resolution can<br/>come up routinely in a polyphonic setting of Maqam Sikah on Eb,<br/>for example, while the second seems more likely to signal a<br/>dramatic and not unlikely surprising shift of focus.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2010 5:45:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>1/1 75/64 11/8 13/8<br/>&gt; 0 275 551 841<br/>&gt; 75:64 88:75 13:11<br/>&gt; 275 277 289<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This idea led me to focus on a somewhat related sonority that I<br/>&gt; could approximate with some accuracy in my regular 24-note<br/>&gt; temperament with fifths at 704.607 cents, with 7/6 used in place<br/>&gt; of the more complex 75/64:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 7/6 11/8 13/8<br/>&gt; 0 267 551 841<br/>&gt; 7:6 33:28 13:11<br/>&gt; 267 284 289<br/>&gt;</p><p>I find 75/64 to be a more simple interval than 7/6 in a way.<br/>It occurs between 8/5 and 15/8.</p><p>Your 1/1 7/6 11/8 13/8 tetrad could be approximated in 5-limit JI in the<br/>following ways:<br/>1/1 75/64 25/18 25/16  (8/5 15/8 9/4 5/2, a sometimes used chord in common<br/>practice music)<br/>or 1/1 32/27 36/25 8/5  (9/8 4/3 8/5 9/5, also sometimes used in common<br/>practice music)<br/>Though they don&apos;t come very close on some tones.</p><p>In 7-limit there are many many possibilities, several of which come very<br/>close.<br/>A simple one would be 1/1 7/6 7/5 8/5.<br/>Which could be used in for instance 1/1 21/20 7/6 4/3 7/5 3/2 8/5 7/4 28/15<br/>2/1 (7/6 *6/5 on 1/1, 6/5 *7/6 on 4/3, 7/6 * 6/5 on 3/2<br/>I&apos;m thinking arabic music is 7-limit myself, 11 and 13 limit intervals are<br/>much more complex and don&apos;t work very well in musical structures I think.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 1:51:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt;<br/>   &gt; Hi Margo,</p><p>Hello, Marcel and thank you for an interesting reply.</p><p>&gt; I find 75/64 to be a more simple interval than 7/6 in a way.<br/>&gt; It occurs between 8/5 and 15/8.</p><p>&gt; Your 1/1 7/6 11/8 13/8 tetrad could be approximated in 5-limit JI in<br/>&gt; the following ways: &gt; 1/1 75/64 25/18 25/16 (8/5 15/8 9/4 5/2, &gt; a sometimes used chord in common practice music) or &gt; 1/1 32/27 36/25 8/5 (9/8 4/3 8/5 9/5, &gt; also sometimes used in common practice music)<br/>&gt; Though they don&apos;t come very close on some tones.</p><p>Here I would certainly agree that 75/64 and 7/6 are in a similar<br/>category as small minor thirds, while 36/25 in fact has been<br/>mentioned by Dariush Anooshfar, a Persian musician, as a fine tuning for a fifth lowered by a koron, often roughly a third-tone<br/>of about 70 cents.</p><p>As you may be suggesting when you note that your ratios &quot;don&apos;t<br/>come very close on some tones,&quot; we need some intervals with a<br/>neutral quality, or what I often call a &quot;Zalzalian&quot; quality after<br/>the great 8th-century &apos;oudist (or lutenist, to cite this instrument&apos;s<br/>European form) Mansur Zalzal.</p><p>It is easily done, as Anooshfar and others have demonstrated. For<br/>example, 36/25 plus a 9:8 tone gives us a neutral sixth at 81/50 or about 835 cents. Using some of your ratios above, and proceeding in<br/>this way, we can obtain, for example, a 9-note version of the Persian<br/>Shur Dastgah, to which Anooshfar&apos;s persian.scl in the Scala archives<br/>might be compared (revealing my indebtedness to you both!):</p><p>|<br/>9-note Shur, ratios of 2-3-5: Includes 36/25 koron, minor and neutral 6ths<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         27/25            133.238 large limma, BP small semitone<br/>  2:         75/64            274.582 classic augmented second<br/>  3:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth<br/>  4:         36/25            631.283 classic diminished fifth<br/>  5:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/>  6:         25/16            772.627 classic augmented fifth<br/>  7:         81/50            835.193 acute minor sixth<br/>  8:        225/128           976.537 augmented sixth<br/>  9:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>The seven-note &quot;textbook&quot; form of Shur -- actually a family of<br/>melodic themes or related modes -- uses steps 0-1-2-3-5-6-8-9.<br/>Additionally, step 4, the fifth lowered by a koron, often occurs<br/>in descending passages, and additionally is used in some of the<br/>gushehs (melodic themes) of Shur to create a transposed form of<br/>the lower tetrachord (0-133-275-498 cents) on the 4/3. The neutral<br/>sixth, step 7, most commonly occurs an octave lower as the third<br/>below the final (50/81 in JI terms), but can also arise as the<br/>sixth above it in certain gushehs.</p><p>&gt; In 7-limit there are many many possibilities, several of which come<br/>&gt; very close.</p><p>&gt;  A simple one would be 1/1 7/6 7/5 8/5.</p><p>&gt;  Which could be used in for instance &gt; 1/1 21/20 7/6 4/3 7/5 3/2 8/5 7/4 28/15 2/1 &gt; (7/6 *6/5 on 1/1, 6/5 *7/6 on 4/3, 7/6  * 6/5 on 3/2)</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m thinking arabic music is 7-limit myself, 11 and 13 limit<br/>&gt; intervals are much more complex and don&apos;t work very well in musical<br/>&gt; structures I think.</p><p>What I&apos;d say we need for lots of the Near Eastern modes and styles --<br/>not all, as Ozan Yarman would rightly have me emphasize! -- is some<br/>way of obtaining neutral intervals.

All these names literally refer to the<br/>&quot;fourth&quot; degree of a scale, but are now used to identify often quite<br/>different kinds of modal structures in different regions of the Near<br/>East. Please take my slip of Chargah when I meant the Persian<br/>Dastgah-e Chahargah as a warm tribute to Ozan Yarman, who has made<br/>the Turkish form of this name vividly familiar to me!</p><p>With warmest apologies,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 1:14:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed.

(C = 208)&gt; : 225 : 264 : 312    (264 - 225 = 39 = G)<br/>We can find many other series using  this algorithm, such as<br/>204 : 239 : 280 : 328 : 384 : 448 : 512 (here it ends with a 6:7:8)<br/>Depending on the starting interval all would be more or less<br/>divergent, and some divergence actually introduces interesting<br/>variations (the 16/13 is a product of such divergence in the 64 : 75<br/>series).<br/>Now, as it&apos;s been discussed presently in this list, some will argue<br/>that difference tones in practice may not be heard in all conditions.<br/>They will be heard very well with double flutes and bells, and less<br/>with strings but then the strings can make profit of such scales for<br/>an other aspect, the synchronicity of harmonic beatings they also have.<br/>This &quot;fractal isrep&quot; minor third, as you very well noticed, is quite<br/>close to the superparticiular 7/6. It means here the 7th harmonic of<br/>&quot;64&quot; is close to the 6th harmonic of &quot;75&quot; and their &quot;harmonic<br/>beating&quot; is 6*75 - 7*64 = 2 ;<br/>the next interval (75:88) will beat at  6*88 - 7*75 = 3, and the next<br/>one (11:13) at 8. Therefore we can speak here of &quot;beating<br/>synchronicity&quot;, that is similarly found in many historical western tunings.<br/>Interestingly enough,<br/>if 75/64 generates, octaves lower, 11/8,<br/>7/6 generates 4/3, and that&apos;s precisely the fourth you mention in<br/>&quot;Sazkar Jadid,  approx. 1/1  7/6  39/32  4/3&quot;,<br/>and the whole scale Sazkar Jadid - Bayyati you mention :<br/>96 : 112 : 117 : 128 : 144 : 156 : 168 : 192<br/>is remarquably coherent.</p><p>&gt; Buzurg is one of my favorites! I tend to use the term generally not<br/>&gt; only for the full pentachord 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3-56/39-3/2, but for<br/>&gt; the lower tetrachord, a tuning I love for Dastgah-e Bayat-e Esfahan.<br/>&gt; Indeed this is a beautiful permutation on Ibn Sina&apos;s 14:13-13:12-8:7,<br/>&gt; and I wonder if Safi al-Din or Qutb al-Din conceived it in this way.<br/>&gt; Combining two just slendro scales to get this result is ingenious!<br/>&gt; While getting the Ethno2 zip, I found a copy of your 1/1 article on<br/>&gt; slendro which I must read! And I see you have some intervals at around<br/>&gt; 943 cents, which reminded me of this little improvisation in a JI<br/>&gt; slendro:<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForErin.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForErin.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s a lovely sound and mood ! And I like very much the small<br/>commas &quot;Gamelan-style&quot; dissonances.<br/>About Buzurg, I have no idea if apart from the main pentachord my<br/>version is very traditional, since in the remnant tetrachord I simply<br/>did a transposition by 3/2, which was in the structure of the<br/>slendros - that&apos;s why I call it &quot;S-N-Buzurg&quot;, for &quot;Surak&quot; and<br/>&quot;Nat&quot; (slendros) interleaved to form this ten tones matrix that<br/>contains many heptatonic scales, among which also some sorts of<br/>Pelogs also. It was created for a suite of pieces entitled<br/>&quot;Estranget&eacute;s and Arabesques&quot;, (a name inspired by baroque<br/>divertissment pieces playing on the forbidden side of the meantone),<br/>and interpreted by my microtonal ensemble, in which we were<br/>continuously juggling between the Persian and Javanese sides of the<br/>tuning.</p><p>&gt; In the second part of my article on your isrep_75 and my variation of<br/>&gt; 1/1-7/6-11/8-13/8, I plan to discuss your soria12, which as you<br/>&gt; intended is a fine tuning for Shur Dastgah in an Ibn Sina kind of<br/>&gt; interpretation. This will just be opening the subject, and I eagerly<br/>&gt; await your 17-tone Soria.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One comment for now. In your s-n-buzurg.scl, you show how a Persian<br/>&gt; tuning such as Buzurg can be realized in a scale with both septimal<br/>&gt; intervals such as 8:7 and 7:4, and in certain positions hemi-fourths<br/>&gt; at around 240-260 cents, along with intervals around 940-960 cents.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering whether or how, in your Soria-17, you could combine the<br/>&gt; features of both soria.scl (with 951 cents above the 1/1) and<br/>&gt; soria12.scl (with 974 cents, close to Ibn Sina&apos;s 7/4).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Amine Beyhom has measured steps of around 242 cents in a Turkish<br/>&gt; version of Hijaz, and the leading Persian performer and scholar<br/>&gt; Dariush Tala&grave;i writes that steps of around 240 or 250 cents are usual<br/>&gt; for Chargah, the Persian equivalent of Hijaz. The 7:6 step of Qutb<br/>&gt; al-Din is also very popular in Persian and Turkish versions. So<br/>&gt; there&apos;s your musicological justification, if you&apos;re inclined to take<br/>&gt; Soria-17 in this direction of including some hemi-fourths as well as<br/>&gt; septimal intervals.</p><p>When I developped the first version (of the Ethno archive) I remember<br/>I found that those strange hemi-fourths had some character, and being<br/>in hurry I left the scale with that &quot;very flat Bb&quot; (of 951 c.) as it<br/>was. Coming back to it I thought it was exagerated in a Persian<br/>context, and my aim for those Ethno tunings being to find  the most<br/>&quot;realistically Persian intervals&quot;, I found this second recurrent<br/>series, ending more classically with this Bb more reasonably close to<br/>7/4.</p><p>Normally, if we extend the series to 17 tones, we can&apos;t have both<br/>near each other. The 951 c. was just a local divergence, and we can<br/>have one in only one place, so it would be a choice between having<br/>just one at some special place, or none.<br/>But actually I just tried now the two series and it seems that the<br/>second one would arrive to something close to 17-edo but with very<br/>high numbers, while the first one would resume to lower numbers, and<br/>there is this very strange thing as the series of fourths<br/>degenerates : after the flat Eb (259 c., quite low also) the series<br/>produces again a Bb, this time of 967 c. (16c. higher than the first<br/>one) ! - Was your question inspired by some sort of vision ? I never<br/>seen such a funny thing ! - like if the series turned backwards to<br/>fix its transgressions !<br/>So finally the answer is yes, in that precise series we could combine<br/>the features of both versions, without leaving the series. The scale<br/>would have 18 tones then but it&apos;s not a problem. Do you see an<br/>interest to have both Bb ? And wouldn&apos;t Eb be a better place for that<br/>double note, as you seem to have some good examples of that ?<br/>With C in 5330, the end of the Airos series of fourfths would then be :<br/>C   =  5330<br/>F   =  7120<br/>Bb =  9503<br/>Eb (252 c.) = 12330<br/>Ab  =  16536<br/>Eb (268 c.) = 24889<br/>(the series goes more and more crazy after with 28002 then 15856 :<br/>99541 : 237178 then stops).</p><p>One question I would like to ask you (and others), is how I could<br/>write the names of the 17 notes of, lets say more generally, a 17-ET,<br/>in Persian music (with sori ad koron symbols) and in (western)<br/>microtonal music ?<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2010 5:42:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Jacques (and all),</p><p>As you suggested, I am posting a rather long discussion of the<br/>Persian koron and sori notation and how it is used with a<br/>modern 17-note tar of the kind presented by Hormoz Farhat<br/>(see persian-far.scl in the Scala archives), as well as how<br/>it may apply to 17-ET and some unequal systems such as my<br/>regular 704.607 cent temperament in a 17-MOS version or your<br/>rationally coherent Soria (currently 12 of 17 in soria12.scl).</p><p>Because a discussion of the koron and sori is an area where<br/>lots of people on this list, including Persian musicians,<br/>might wish to contribute, I have decided to post my article<br/>in a new thread.</p><p>However, I find it appropriate to post this explanation of<br/>my longer article so that people will know what it addresses<br/>without reading all 500+ lines, and also so that I may<br/>express my very special appreciation to you for the chance<br/>to write this article.</p><p>More generally, one lesson I have learned from people such<br/>as Ozan Yarman is that when it comes to Near Eastern music<br/>and its medieval Islamic sources, looking at things in some<br/>detail can be helpful.

Your<br/>article on just gamelan tunings is fascinating, and I will<br/>comment on one of your observations which very much fits my own<br/>experience below, where you raise the topic of the &quot;far side&quot; of<br/>meantone.</p><p>&gt; Then the &quot;fractality&quot; comes from the fact that the same<br/>&gt; algorithm of differential coherence is applied recurrently<br/>&gt; between the terms of the sequence :<br/>&gt; If I resume the terms  64,  75,  88,  104,  128, 192  to<br/>&gt; H(0), H(1), H(2), H(3), H(4), H(5),<br/>&gt; we can generalise this property by saying that<br/>&gt; 8H(n+1) - 8H(n) = H(n+2)<br/>&gt; (ex : 8*75 - 8*64 = 88, etc.).</p><p>This makes the concept very undestandable.</p><p>&gt;  In a even more resumed form (like in these Scala files), I<br/>&gt;  write it simply : 8x - 8 = x^2 and the general solution of<br/>&gt;  this algorithm, where x = the fractal ratio of the generator<br/>&gt;  is</p><p>&gt;  4 - 2*sqrt of 2 =  1.1715728752538  or 274.136 c.</p><p>&gt;  You might be interested in another way I have to see this<br/>&gt;  interval, as a &quot;C#* : E interval of a Hijaz (in C) whose<br/>&gt;  difference tone would result in G&quot;...</p><p>&gt;  ex. (C = 208)&gt; : 225 : 264 : 312    (264 - 225 = 39 = G)</p><p>This is interesting! My first reaction was to think of the Hijaz<br/>tetrachord of Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi at 33:36:42:44 -- or, as I<br/>now realize, specifically of the lower trichord (151-267 cents),<br/>here instead 136-277 cents, yielding a 33/26 rather than 14/11.<br/>Although this may be beside the immediate point, I notice that<br/>277/208 would yield a very nice fourth at around 495.963 cents<br/>for a Hijaz tetrachord plus a tone at 208:225:264:277:312.</p><p>Another curious point is that the difference of 264:277 is 13,<br/>which somehow seems in keeping with the &quot;spirit&quot; of the ratios of<br/>13 present such as 33:26, and possibly also 208:225 taken as<br/>having an affinity to 13:12 at only 676:675 larger.</p><p>&gt;  We can find many other series using  this algorithm, such as<br/>&gt;  204 : 239 : 280 : 328 : 384 : 448 : 512 (here it ends with a 6:7:8)</p><p>&gt;  Depending on the starting interval all would be more or less<br/>&gt;  divergent, and some divergence actually introduces interesting<br/>&gt;  variations (the 16/13 is a product of such divergence in the<br/>&gt;  64 : 75 series).</p><p>&gt;  Now, as it&apos;s been discussed presently in this list, some will<br/>&gt;  argue that difference tones in practice may not be heard in<br/>&gt;  all conditions. They will be heard very well with double<br/>&gt;  flutes and bells, and less with strings but then the strings<br/>&gt;  can make profit of such scales for an other aspect, the<br/>&gt;  synchronicity of harmonic beatings they also have.  This<br/>&gt;  &quot;fractal isrep&quot; minor third, as you very well noticed, is<br/>&gt;  quite close to the superparticiular 7/6. It means here the 7th<br/>&gt;  harmonic of &quot;64&quot; is close to the 6th harmonic of &quot;75&quot; and<br/>&gt;  their &quot;harmonic beating&quot; is 6*75 - 7*64 = 2 ; the next<br/>&gt;  interval (75:88) will beat at 6*88 - 7*75 = 3, and the next<br/>&gt;  one (11:13) at 8. Therefore we can speak here of &quot;beating<br/>&gt;  synchronicity&quot;, that is similarly found in many historical<br/>&gt;  western tunings.</p><p>This &quot;beating synchronicity&quot; is generally something I have not<br/>focused on in the tunings I mostly use; but it would be<br/>interesting if this phenomenon could arise without my being aware<br/>of it!</p><p>&gt;  Interestingly enough,<br/>&gt;  if 75/64 generates, octaves lower, 11/8,<br/>&gt;  7/6 generates 4/3, and that&apos;s precisely the fourth you mention in<br/>&gt;  &quot;Sazkar Jadid,  approx. 1/1  7/6  39/32  4/3&quot;,<br/>&gt;  and the whole scale Sazkar Jadid - Bayyati you mention :<br/>&gt;  96 : 112 : 117 : 128 : 144 : 156 : 168 : 192<br/>&gt;  is remarquably coherent.</p><p>Your remarks caused me to consider Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim<br/>tetrachord, with two conjunct tetrachords plus a 9:8 tone forming<br/>a mode very similar to that of the modern Dastgah-e Segah, as I<br/>recall you have pointed out, with the final placed on the third<br/>step:</p><p>          8      13      11<br/>      96     104     117    128<br/>      1/1    9/8    39/32   4/3<br/>       0     204     342    498<br/>         9:8    13:12  128:117<br/>         204     139     155</p><p>A curious question is whether the last difference of 11 has any<br/>connection to the proximity between 128:117 and 12:11 at 352:351<br/>smaller? That is, is there any special significance if the<br/>differences suggest, for example, the prime factors present or<br/>approximated in a given tuning?</p><p>[on your s-n-buzurg.scl]</p><p>&gt;  About Buzurg, I have no idea if apart from the main pentachord<br/>&gt;  my version is very traditional, since in the remnant<br/>&gt;  tetrachord I simply did a transposition by 3/2, which was in<br/>&gt;  the structure of the slendros - that&apos;s why I call it<br/>&gt;  &quot;S-N-Buzurg&quot;, for &quot;Surak&quot; and &quot;Nat&quot; (slendros) interleaved to<br/>&gt;  form this ten tones matrix that contains many heptatonic<br/>&gt;  scales, among which also some sorts of Pelogs also.</p><p>The question of a Buzurg pentachord or its lower tetrachord as<br/>the basis for a maqam is very interesting, although I find myself<br/>often also simply adding another Buzurg tetrachord from 3/2 to<br/>2/1. An upper tetrachord of Bayyati or Rast is also possible, but<br/>maybe that&apos;s best discussed in another thread.</p><p>(Using a variation of your -c series 208:225:264:312, I can get a<br/>nice Buzurg tetrachord at 208:225:257:277, and a complete Buzurg<br/>pentachord at 208:225:257:277:299:312. Might these be fine-tuned<br/>for greater coherence?)</p><p>&gt; It was created for a suite of pieces entitled &quot;Estranget?s and<br/>&gt; Arabesques&quot;, (a name inspired by baroque divertissment pieces<br/>&gt; playing on the forbidden side of the meantone), and interpreted<br/>&gt; by my microtonal ensemble, in which we were continuously<br/>&gt; juggling between the Persian and Javanese sides of the tuning.</p><p>Curiously, a modern maqam interpretation which may much like a<br/>Buzurg tetrachord occurs in what is called Hijaz Gharib or Sikah<br/>Gharib, literally a &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;estranged&quot; Hijaz or Sikah. The<br/>idea seems to be that the usual central step of an Arab Hijaz at<br/>7:6 or larger has been &quot;compressed&quot; to possibly around 8:7, thus<br/>more resembling the second step of a Sikah trichord at around<br/>9:8.

Journey to &quot;Sazkar Jadid&quot;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for the main question: how might the steps of this intriguing<br/>&gt; structure be used in maqam music? The solution that occurred to<br/>&gt; me is a variation on Maqam Sazkar. The ascending form of the basic<br/>&gt; maqam is as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  Sazkar Jadid     tone       Bayyati<br/>&gt;             |-------------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;             A      B*    C*     D      E     F*   F#*    A<br/>&gt; cents       0     264   341    495    705   837   969   1200<br/>&gt; JI approx  1/1    7/6  39/32   4/3    3/2   13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>&gt;               264    77     154    209   132   132   231<br/>&gt;               7:6 117:112 128:117  9:8  13:12  14:13 8:7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This form draws on two beautiful JI tunings of the renowned<br/>&gt; 11th-century philosopher and music theorist Ibn Sina. His noble<br/>&gt; tuning known as Mustaqim (which in Arabic, like Rast in Persian,<br/>&gt; means &quot;right, correct, standard&quot;) features a tetrachord of<br/>&gt; 1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3 or 0-204-342-498 cents (204-139-155 cents).<br/>&gt; Here there is a tone or major second, followed by two Zalazalian<br/>&gt; or neutral second steps, with the first (13:12, 139 cents)<br/>&gt; smaller than the second (128:117, 155 cents). In the Arab world<br/>&gt; today, this pattern is sometimes as &quot;Rast Jadid&quot; or &quot;New Rast,&quot;<br/>&gt; in contrast to a more usual Rast where the larger Zalzalian<br/>&gt; second precedes the smaller.</p><p>Sazkar being a Turkish contrivance, the AEU rendition or its 53<br/>Holderian commas approximation seems closer to practice with the scale<br/>of this maqam:</p><p>Degrees:<br/>0 9 17 22 31 39 40 48 53 66 70</p><p>Steps:<br/>&#x9;&#x9;5&#x9;9&#x9;8&#x9;9&#x9;5&#x9;13&#x9;4<br/>&#x9;8&#x9;5&#x9;9&#x9;(so-called Ushshaq tetrachord)<br/>9&#x9;8&#x9;5&#x9;9&#x9;9&#x9;8&#x9;5</p><p>First the maqam starts off with a Segah openining, proceeds to expose<br/>it further, then, possibly skipping the Ushshaq tetrachord, concludes<br/>fully in Rast.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how Arabs use it today. I know their habit of lowering<br/>perde segah to the point of invalidating the leading tone below it and<br/>skipping all the way down to perde dugah. But what does this matter?<br/>The maqam has been developed in the Ottoman court during the 19th<br/>Century. The authentic intonation is ought to be searched in<br/>Istanbuline aires.</p><p>(So much for 24-tET as the ultimate simple-resolution basis for all<br/>maqamat, eh Carl? You ought to get your hands on some masters of<br/>Classical Turkish music.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Sazkar, the first interval of a Rast tetrachord at a major<br/>&gt; second is replaced by the striking leap of a minor third -- here<br/>&gt; the 7:6. Thus we have 0-264-341-495 cents, or 264-77-154 cents.<br/>&gt; The small middle interval is here our regular minor second or<br/>&gt; limma at 77 cents -- but with the quite extraordinary effect this<br/>&gt; step has in the context of Sazkar, or Sazkar Jadid as I term this<br/>&gt; variation.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, it could be an interesting trial for Sazkar-i Jadid!</p><p>&gt; The upper tetrachord (E-A) features another of Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt; tunings, in a just form a tetrachord sometimes read as either<br/>&gt; 28:26;24:21 or 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3 (0-128-267-498 cents), with 7:6<br/>&gt; divided arithmetically into 14:13:12; or 12:13:14:16,<br/>&gt; 1/1-13/12-7/6-4/3 (0-139-267-498 cents), with 7:6 divided<br/>&gt; harmonically into 12:13:14. Either form is represented by a<br/>&gt; tempered 0-132-264-495 cents (132-132-231 cents),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I find this approximation satisfactory, it illustrates a<br/>&gt; form of &quot;intonational color-blindness&quot; to which this temperament<br/>&gt; is subject, losing the fine distinction between 14:13 and 13:12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The descending form brings into play the 11/8, and also a<br/>&gt; cadential step a larger neutral second below the final:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            G*    A      B*    C*     D*     E     F*   F#*    A<br/>&gt; cents    -154    0     264   341    551    705   837   969   1200<br/>&gt; JI approx 11/12 1/1    7/6  39/32   11/8   3/2   13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>&gt;               154  267    77     209    154    132   132   231<br/>&gt;              12:11 7:6 117:112  44:39  12:11  13:12 14:13  8:7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The D* or virtually just 11/8 is to me a kind of &quot;mirror<br/>&gt; reflection&quot; of the koron or lowered version of the fifth<br/>&gt; often used in Shur Dastgah when one descends toward the final:<br/>&gt; here, instead, the fourth is raised, so that in a Persian<br/>&gt; manner we might term D* a sori, or D&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Somehow the contour of the ascending tetrachord A-B*-C*-D, or<br/>&gt; the descending pentachord leading to the final, E-D*-C*-B*-A,<br/>&gt; seems &quot;jazzy&quot; or &quot;Bluesy&quot; to me, possibly because of the<br/>&gt; junxtaposition of a septimal minor third and Zalzalian or neutral<br/>&gt; third above the final.

Analysis and modulation: Enter Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While Sazkar Jadid was taking shape for me in its ascending and<br/>&gt; descending forms, I realized that the Sazkar Jadid tetrachord<br/>&gt; could lead to an interesting analysis if viewed in JI terms as<br/>&gt; follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               A       B*   C*     D<br/>&gt; tempered:     0      264  341    495<br/>&gt;                  264    77    154<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:          1/1     7/6  11/9  4/3<br/>&gt;               0      267  347   498<br/>&gt;                  7:6   22:21 12:11<br/>&gt;                  267    81    151</p><p>Ah, this is the permutation of the Hijaz-i Qadim tetrachord in its<br/>pure form I was talking about. Rotate the intervals thus for the<br/>rendition:</p><p>12:11 x 7:6 x 22:21.</p><p>Voila!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; While a reader might rightly call attention to the rather<br/>&gt; inaccurate representation of 11:9 in this temperament, which<br/>&gt; indeed is much closer to 28:23 or 39:32, our main interest here<br/>&gt; is in the adjacent intervals of 7:6, 22:21, and 12:11 (at<br/>&gt; 267-81-151 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are, of course, the steps of Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Chromatic<br/>&gt; (22:21-12:11-7:6), famously permuted around 1300 by Qutb al-Din<br/>&gt; al-Shirazi in a classic form of Hijaz, which John Chalmers has<br/>&gt; temred &quot;neo-chromatic&quot; because of the placement of the large step<br/>&gt; in the middle:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               1/1   12/11     14/11  4/3<br/>&gt;                0     151       418   498<br/>&gt;                  12:11    7:6    22:21<br/>&gt;                   151     267      81<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                G*     A         B*    C*<br/>&gt;                0     154       418   495<br/>&gt;                  154      264      77<br/>&gt;</p><p>I was hasty.

In descending, the<br/>&gt; larger Zalzalian sixth at 859 cents (near 23/14 or 64/39), found<br/>&gt; at E*, might be inflected to a minor sixth at Eb or 782 cents,<br/>&gt; very close to a just 11/7. Some styles might favor one version or<br/>&gt; the other of this sixth degree, with others fluidly alternating<br/>&gt; between them.</p><p>Nice alteration. This scale has turned into a delectable Zavil now:<br/>Rast diatonic with Hijaz tetrachord finish.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The version with the Zalzalian sixth also has an upper tetrachord<br/>&gt; D*-E-F*-G* at 0-154-286-495 cents or 154-132-209 cents which I<br/>&gt; here call Huseyni, since the order of the larger Zalzalian second<br/>&gt; followed by the smaller is more typical of Maqam Huseyni than of<br/>&gt; Maqam Bayyati, in this tuning often 132-154-209 cents. However,<br/>&gt; the term &quot;Bayyati&quot; is often applied in Arab theory to either<br/>&gt; arrangement, the general concept being simply two Zalzalian<br/>&gt; seconds followed by a tone (or 3-3-4 in a usual 24-step<br/>&gt; notation).<br/>&gt;</p><p>I fear, 154 cents still not large enough an interval for Turkish<br/>tastes in Huseyni.</p><p>&gt; From this Maqam Hijaz on G* we might easily proceed to related<br/>&gt; destinations such as, in my style, Rast and related forms on G*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 3. The 1/1-7/6-11/8-13/8 chord: resolutions and modulations<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the Sazkar Jadid introduces the notes of the chord, how<br/>&gt; might it be resolved in the context of what I shall term<br/>&gt; Zalzalian polyphony, or the application of polyphonic techniques<br/>&gt; to music drawing on the maqam and dastgah traditions, however<br/>&gt; closely or loosely.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ahha, now it&apos;s getting interesting!</p><p>&gt; In such a polyphonic style, a given vertical progression may<br/>&gt; serve either to realize the qualities of a given maqam or gusheh<br/>&gt; (i.e. a melodic theme or mode within the larger modal family of a<br/>&gt; dastgah), or to move from one such maqam or gusheh to another,<br/>&gt; possibly as part of a more or less standard modulatory scheme.<br/>&gt; Two possible modulations using 1/1-7/6-11/8-13/8 occurred to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first is as follows, with the tempered chord at 0-264-551-705<br/>&gt; cents, and the expanding resolution arriving at a tempered 2:3:4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        F*  +154  G<br/>&gt;        D*   -55  D<br/>&gt;        B*  +231  D<br/>&gt;        A   -209  G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the expansions of the lower ~7:6 minor third to a fifth, and<br/>&gt; of the outer ~13:8 Zalzalian sixth to an octave, are quite<br/>&gt; routine in this type of neomedieval style (the &quot;neomedieval&quot;<br/>&gt; referring both to the Near Eastern tunings and 13th-14th century<br/>&gt; European polyphonic techniques which here have a &quot;fusion&quot; in the<br/>&gt; setting of a 21st-century temperament). The ~33:28 minor third<br/>&gt; between the two middle voices likewise has a usual resolution<br/>&gt; contracting to a unison, with melodic steps of 231 and 55 cents<br/>&gt; that might represent the 8:7 and 28:27 steps of the Archytas<br/>&gt; Diatonic. Stated more generically as 3-1 or 3-5 and 6-8, these<br/>&gt; basic patterns for resolutions can apply to major, minor, or<br/>&gt; Zalzalian (neutral) intervals alike.<br/>&gt;</p><p>A touch of Marchetto perhaps?</p><p>&gt; Other resolutions here are a bit less &quot;classical,&quot; for example<br/>&gt; the stepwise expansion of the upper ~13:11 minor third to a<br/>&gt; fourth (D*-F* to D-G), but the total effect is a progression<br/>&gt; &quot;taking us somewhere&quot; in a maqam performance, here to G. One<br/>&gt; colorful possibility for a new maqam on G is a form of Najdi or<br/>&gt; &grave;Ajam Murassa:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                       Najdi                   Mustaqim<br/>&gt;            |---------------------------|--------------------|<br/>&gt;            G      A      B     C*      D       E     F*     G<br/>&gt;                          Mustaqim<br/>&gt;                   |--------------------|<br/>&gt; cents      0     209    418    551    705     914   1046  1200<br/>&gt; JI approx 1/1   44/39  14/11  11/8    3/2    56/33  11/6   2/1<br/>&gt;              209    209    132    154    209     132     154<br/>&gt;            44:39 182:121 121:112 12:11 128:117 121:112  12:11<br/>&gt;</p><p>This Najdi is but a variant of Penchgah it appears.</p><p>&gt; One way that has been suggested to view this fascinating maqam is<br/>&gt; as two conjunct tetrachords of Rast (or here Mustaqim or Rast<br/>&gt; Jadid) with a tone added below to fill out the octave, and with<br/>&gt; this added step now felt as the final. The affinity to the<br/>&gt; descending form of Sazkar Jadid, with its 11/8 step above the<br/>&gt; final, may have drawn me to this maqam as a companion for use in<br/>&gt; an improvisation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, one could follow the vertical resolution of our<br/>&gt; 1/1-7/6-11/8-13/8 sonority to G with many maqamat, but this<br/>&gt; choice is to me engaging.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another resolution leads in another direction:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        F*   -77   E*<br/>&gt;        D*  +209   E*<br/>&gt;        B*  -209   A*<br/>&gt;        A    +55   A*<br/>&gt;</p><p>mp3 examples should facilitate understanding at this stage. Who&apos;s up<br/>for preparing them?</p><p>&gt; This resolution treats the outer small Zalzalian sixth at 837<br/>&gt; cents as a diminished seventh (which it is, being formed from<br/>&gt; three minor thirds) contracting to a fifth: the lowest voice<br/>&gt; ascends A-A* by a diesis or minimal semitone of 55 cents, while<br/>&gt; the highest voice descends F*-E* by a regular 77-cent limma.<br/>&gt; The two lower voices have a classic 3-1 resolution, one moving by<br/>&gt; a regular 209-cent tone and the other by a 55-cent semitone,<br/>&gt; which here may be said to represent 28:27 (63 cents). The middle<br/>&gt; pair of voices expand from regular minor third to fifth (3-5),<br/>&gt; and the highest pair from a like minor third to a unison (3-1),<br/>&gt; these progressions involving steps of a regular tone or semitone<br/>&gt; (209 or 77 cents).[1]</p><p>A touch of Vicentino this time.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; While this journey up a diesis or small semitone to A* could lead<br/>&gt; into many maqamat, one choice I like is a usual Huseyni, as if to<br/>&gt; offset the more &quot;exotic&quot; qualities of Sazkar Jadid:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                   Huseyni         tone         Huseyni<br/>&gt;            |--------------------|.......|--------------------|<br/>&gt;            A*     B     C*      D*      E*     F#     G*     A*<br/>&gt; cents      0     154   286     495     705    859    991   1200<br/>&gt; JI approx 1/1   12/11 13/11    4/3     3/2   64/39  16/9   2/1<br/>&gt;              154    132    209     209    154     132   209<br/>&gt;             12:11  13:12  44:39    9:8  128:117  13:12  9:8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Part II, I will present another maqam that later occurred to<br/>&gt; me as including 1/1-7/6-11/8-13/8 in a structure I would freely<br/>&gt; use either ascending or descending, with another possible<br/>&gt; resolution of this sonority, this time suggesting a modulation<br/>&gt; which offers an opportunity to touch on a topic which I hope will<br/>&gt; receive much fuller discussion: Jacques Dudon&apos;s &quot;Soria&quot; algorithm<br/>&gt; for a 17-note rational tuning, and some versions of 12-note<br/>&gt; subsets he has posted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----<br/>&gt; Note<br/>&gt; ----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. From the viewpoint of polyphonic technique, these two<br/>&gt; resolutions of A-B*-D*-F*, showing how a Zalzalian sixth can<br/>&gt; either expand to an octave, or less &quot;classically&quot; contract to a<br/>&gt; fifth, might recall the discussion by Marchettus of Padua (1317)</p><p>Ahha, once more, my haste!</p><p>&gt; about how a major sixth typically expands to an octave, but<br/>&gt; through a &quot;feigned&quot; inflection or cadence can also contract to a<br/>&gt; fifth! In a 17-note system, or a larger system like this<br/>&gt; featuring most similar types of intervals, a Zalzalian seventh<br/>&gt; similarly may contract &quot;classically&quot; to a fifth (7-5), or<br/>&gt; strikingly expand to an octave, with George Secor educating me on<br/>&gt; the latter choice in the setting of his 17-tone well-temperament<br/>&gt; (17-WT). To take simple two-voice example, the small Zalzalian<br/>&gt; seventh or augmented sixth Eb-C# at 1046 cents or ~11:6 might<br/>&gt; resolve either by contracting to E-B (7-5) or expanding to the<br/>&gt; octave D-D. In a Near Eastern context, the first resolution can<br/>&gt; come up routinely in a polyphonic setting of Maqam Sikah on Eb,<br/>&gt; for example, while the second seems more likely to signal a<br/>&gt; dramatic and not unlikely surprising shift of focus.<br/>&gt;</p><p>But really, some mp3 demonstrations would help a lot.</p><p>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2010 12:56:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Dear Margo, this is a late reply:<br/>&gt;  (use a fixed-width font, why won&apos;t you?)<br/>&gt;  [222]<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Thank you for such a thoughtful and informative reply, and one<br/>especially appreciated at a time when you have been seeing to the<br/>publication of your new book, for example.</p><p>One of the things your response to my Sazkar Jadid illustrates is how<br/>the same name for a maqam can come with quite different understandings<br/>in different regions of the Near East. It is somewhat amusing how the<br/>two of us, in response to the name Sazkar, set out on quite different<br/>understandings of the _seyir_ -- that is, the &quot;path&quot; or procedure --<br/>to be followed in travelling through this maqam.</p><p>However, this confusion has brought forth at least two happy results,<br/>I hope you will agree. First, I now have some understanding of an<br/>Osmanli Sazkar, if that is the right term, along with a possible<br/>hypothesis as to how this classic Ottoman seyir could have led to the<br/>current Arab maqam, thanks to your clear explanation!</p><p>To keep this response at a more reasonable length and to make it<br/>easier to follow, I will here limit myself mainly to these points: the<br/>Ottoman conception of Sazkar and its seyir as you have so lucidly<br/>presented them; whether and how this seyir might be adapted to my<br/>regular temperament with its different intonation of Rast; and how the<br/>quite different Arab conception of Sazkar might have evolved.</p><p>For the benefit of others who may be reading this, I should quickly<br/>explain two units for measuring steps and intervals which we often<br/>use. The Holdrian comma is equal to one step of 53-EDO, about 22.64<br/>cents; while the yarman is a step in your 79MOS-159 generally equal to<br/>almost precisely 2/3 of a Holdrian comma or 2/159 octave, and is<br/>conveniently equal to about 15-1/8 cents. Thus multiplying the number<br/>of yarmans by 15, and adding a cent for each eight yarmans, gives a<br/>close estimate of the size in cents.</p><p>&gt;&gt;                    Sazkar Jadid     tone       Bayyati<br/>&gt;&gt;               |-------------------|......|-----------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;               A      B*    C*     D      E     F*   F#*    A<br/>&gt;&gt;   cents       0     264   341    495    705   837   969   1200<br/>&gt;&gt;   JI approx  1/1    7/6  39/32   4/3    3/2   13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>&gt;&gt;                 264    77     154    209   132   132   231<br/>&gt;&gt;                 7:6 117:112 128:117  9:8  13:12  14:13 8:7</p><p>&gt;   Sazkar being a Turkish contrivance, the AEU rendition or its 53<br/>&gt;   Holderian commas approximation seems closer to practice with the<br/>&gt;   scale of this maqam:</p><p>Here I will add some sizes in cents which may help readers new to the<br/>comma system.</p><p>&gt;   Degrees:<br/>&gt;   0   9  17  22  31   39   40    48   53   66  70<br/>    0  204 385 498 702  883  906  1087 1200 1494 1585<br/>~  1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2  5/3 27/16 15/8  2/1 64/27 5/2</p><p>In this interpretation of Rast, there are no neutral intervals, but<br/>rather 5-limit steps of 8 and 5 commas, or around 10:9 and 16:15,<br/>where a different style of interpretation such as mine would have<br/>neutral or Zalzalian seconds of around 7 and 6 commas. Both<br/>interpretations can be found in 10th-13th century Islamic sources.<br/>Also, as will become clear in your presentation of the seyir, the step<br/>at 39 commas or 5/3 is used in the opening portion of the maqam, and<br/>the 27/16 step in the closing portion.</p><p>Before addressing the question you ask below about the Arab<br/>interpretation of Sazkar, I might present another version of your<br/>listing of the steps and interval sizes for Rast using commas, and<br/>also giving the tempered sizes in my 704.607-cent regular tuning:</p><p>    Degrees:<br/>    0    9   16    22   31   38   40    48    53   66    69<br/>    0   204  362  498  702  860   906  1064  1200 1494  1562<br/>   1/1  9/8 21/17 4/3  3/2 23/14 27/16 24/13  2/1 64/27 42/17<br/>    0   209  363  495  705  859   914  1068  1200 1486  1562</p><p>In fact, from this &quot;Zalzalian&quot; interpretation of what in the Ottoman<br/>tradition would typically be more of a 5-limit intonation, I can<br/>deduce a possible hypothesis for how the current Arab understanding of<br/>Sazkar could have developed from the classic Ottoman interpretation,<br/>as mentioned above!</p><p>However, it may first be of interest to see how your explanation of<br/>the classic seyir might translate to a Zalzalian tuning of Rast of a<br/>kind which I understand is sometimes practiced in Turkey also. Here I<br/>take it that the first portion of the seyir begins on perde segah; the<br/>second portion with the so-called Ushshaq tetrachord on perde dugah;<br/>and the final portion in Rast, of course, ending on perde rast. First,<br/>let me quote your seyir and step sizes, adding to your notation of<br/>the steps in commas the sizes of these steps in cents, plus a JI<br/>notation for the degrees above the 1/1 (perde rast) in ratios and<br/>commas:</p><p>&gt;  Steps:<br/>&gt;     5    9    8    9   5   13    4<br/>     113  204  181  204 113  294   91<br/>  5/4  4/3  3/2   5/3 15/8 2/1 64/27 5/2<br/>  17   22   31    39   48  53   66   70<br/>  |---------------|    |--------------|<br/>        Segah      tone      Hijaz</p><p>&gt;     8     5    9  (so-called Ushshaq tetrachord)<br/>     181   113  204<br/>&gt; 9/8   5/4  4/3  3/2<br/>   9    17   22   31<br/>   |---------------|<br/>   Huseyni with 10:9</p><p>&gt;     9    8   5    9    9      8     5<br/>     204  181 113  204  204    181   113<br/>  1/1  9/8  5/4 4/3  3/2  27/16  15/8  2/1<br/>   0    9   17  22   31    40     48   53<br/>   |-------------|   |------------------|<br/>       Rast      tone        Rast</p><p>&gt;  First the maqam starts off with a Segah openining, proceeds to<br/>&gt;  expose it further, then, possibly skipping the Ushshaq tetrachord,<br/>&gt;  concludes fully in Rast.</p><p>Indeed the first portion appears to match your explanation of Maqam<br/>Segah in your thesis. The optional second portion with the 8-5-9<br/>tetrachord, the so-called Ushshaq, might better be called a version of<br/>Huseyni, which in the Ottoman tradition might take a lower step either<br/>around 10:9 (as here) or 11:10 (as in the example in your thesis). The<br/>last part, as advertised, &quot;concludes fully in rast.&quot;</p><p>Here it may be interesting to see how this seyir might translate to my<br/>keyboard and system of intonation, taking F# as perde rast.</p><p>    Degrees:<br/>    0    9   16    22   31   38   40    48    53   66    69<br/>    F#   G#  Bb    B    C#   Eb   Eb*    F    F#    A    Bb<br/>   1/1  9/8 21/17 4/3  3/2 23/14 22/13 63/34  2/1 26/11 42/17<br/>    0   209  363  495  705  859   914  1068  1200 1486  1562</p><p>Seyir part 1: Maqam Segah (Zalzalian version)</p><p>   Steps:<br/>      6    9    7     9      6    13      3<br/>     132  209  154   209    132  286     77<br/> 21/17  4/3  3/2 23/14  63/34 2/1   26/11 42/17<br/>  16    22   31    38    47   53      66   69<br/>  Bb    B    C#    Eb    F    F#      A    Bb<br/>  |----------------|     |-----------------|<br/>        Segah       tone       Hijaz</p><p>Note that in either your correct Ottoman version, or my Zalzalian<br/>variation, the first step of the Segah tetrachord is smaller than the<br/>last, at 5-9-8 or 6-9-7 commas; and that in the upper Hijaz<br/>tetrachord, the large central step is notably wider than the 7:6 often<br/>favored as espcially apt.</p><p>Seyir part 2: A Ushshaq tetrachord</p><p>      7     6    9  (actual Ushshaq tetrachord!)<br/>     154   132  209<br/>&gt; 9/8  21/17 4/3  3/2<br/>   9    16   22    31<br/>   G#   Bb   B     C#<br/>   |----------------|<br/>  Ushshaq with ~12:11</p><p>Here, as it happens, 154 cents at around 12:11 or 128:117 evidently<br/>fits an Ottoman conception of Ushshaq, despite the unsuitability of<br/>the tuning as a whole for a Turkish style -- perhaps an instance of<br/>the proverb that even a broken clock is right at least once a day!</p><p>Seyir part 3: Concluding in Rast</p><p>      9    7     6    9    9      7      6<br/>     209  154   132  209  209    154    132<br/>  1/1  9/8  21/17 4/3   3/2  22/13  63/34  2/1<br/>   0    9    16    22   31    40     47     53<br/>   F#   G#   Bb    B    C#  Eb*/D#    F     F#<br/>   |---------------|    |----------------- -|<br/>         Rast       tone        Rast</p><p>The definition of Rast as around 9-7-6 commas is stated by theorists<br/>such as Tawfiq al-Sabbagh of Syria and Salah al-Din. A yet more<br/>accurate measure of this 9-7-6 variety of Rast as realized in my<br/>regular temperament would be 14-10-9 yarmans.</p><p>&gt;  I don&apos;t know how Arabs use it today. I know their habit of lowering<br/>&gt;  perde segah to the point of invalidating the leading tone below it<br/>&gt;  and skipping all the way down to perde dugah. But what does this<br/>&gt;  matter? The maqam has been developed in the Ottoman court during<br/>&gt;  the 19th Century. The authentic intonation is ought to be searched<br/>&gt;  in Istanbuline aires.</p><p>These matters regarding Arab intonation might be interesting topic for<br/>another thread, and you have stirred my curiosity! However, what I<br/>would like to address here is the Arab understanding of Maqam Sazkar<br/>and a possible connection to the Ottoman conception as you have<br/>artifully explicated it here.</p><p>&gt;  (So much for 24-tET as the ultimate simple-resolution basis for all<br/>&gt;  maqamat, eh Carl? You ought to get your hands on some masters of<br/>&gt;  Classical Turkish music.)</p><p>In the Arab, Persian, and Kurdish traditions also, for example, the<br/>distinction between larger and smaller neutral seconds is important to<br/>interpreters steeped in classical styles. When a step of 130 cents is<br/>wanted (as in one popular Lebanese interpretation of a maqam I play<br/>with a tetrachord of 132-154-209 cents), or a step of 165 cents (as in<br/>your tuning of Huseyni in the Turkish manner), 24-EDO is hardly an<br/>adequate substitute.</p><p>Now for the current Arab interpretation of Maqam Sazkar, and how it<br/>may have evolved from the classic Ottoman Sazkar! Let us begin with<br/>the usual tuning of Maqam Rast at 9-7-6 commas, here giving the Arabic<br/>forms of the perde names, and then showing the strikingly modified<br/>nature of this tetrachord above the final, perde rast of course, in<br/>what is called Sazkar:</p><p>               Typical 9-7-6 Rast</p><p>           rast   dukah sikah jahargah<br/>            F#     G#    Bb    B<br/>commas      0      9     16   22 yarmans     0     14     24   33<br/>cents       0     209   363  495</p><p>      Arab Sazkar jins: 13-3-6 (or 19-5-9 yarmans)</p><p>           rast    kurdi sikah jahargah<br/>            F#      A     Bb       B<br/>commas      0      13     16      22 yarmans     0      19     24      33<br/>cents       0      286   363     495</p><p>Apart from the substitution of perde kurdi for dukah in this<br/>tetrachord, the rest of the seyir is pretty much like a usual Maqam<br/>Rast, with the same options for inflections, like evdj/acem and<br/>huseyni/hisar. After the initial ascent, one possible development is<br/>to use the usual perde dukah rather than kurdi, thus returning to a<br/>usual Maqam Rast of the 9-7-6 type.</p><p>In fact, the hypothesis that occurs to me after reading your<br/>explanation of Ottoman Sazkar as still understood in Turkey is that,<br/>performing the upper Hijaz tetrachord of the seyir in a Zalzalian<br/>style of intonation, Arab interpreters may have transposed the notes<br/>kirdan-sinbulah-buzruk down an octave to rast-kurdi-sikah, thus<br/>arriving at the striking trichord above the final of Arab Sazkar,<br/>which with the usual jaharkah added forms the first tetrachord!</p><p>     Opening of seyir, Ottoman Sazkar based on 9-7-6 Rast</p><p>                  Segah          tone           Hijaz<br/>         |---------------------|      |----------------------|<br/>commas       6       9     7      9     6      13        3<br/>yarmans      9      14     10    14     9      19        5 cents       132     209   154    209    132    286      77<br/>         Bb      B      C#     Eb     F    F#         A     Bb<br/>        sikah jahargah nawa  hisar   awj  kirdan  sunbulah buzruk<br/>                                           |------------------|<br/>                                                    |<br/>                                                    |<br/>                    v----------------- (transpose down an octave)<br/>                    |<br/>                    |<br/>                    |<br/>                Arab Sazkar      tone          Rast<br/>         |---------------------|      |----------------------|<br/>commas       13     3      6       9      9         7     6<br/>yarmans      19     5      9      14      14        10    9<br/>cents        286    77    154    209     209        154  132<br/>         F#       A    Bb      B      C#     Eb*/D#     F    F#<br/>        rast    kurdi sikah jahargah nava    huseyni   awj  kirdan</p><p>This seems to me a not-too-unlikely hypothesis for the present form of<br/>Arab Sazkar, one starting point for my Sazkar Jadid, which differs in<br/>part by being based on a tetrachord of 9-6-7 commas, which the<br/>20th-century Arab theorist Salah al-Din calls Rast Jadid by contrast<br/>with the usual 9-7-6 commas, but which might well take Ibn Sina&apos;s name<br/>of Mustaqim for a maqam with conjunct tetrachords of 1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3<br/>or 204-139-155 cents, not too far from 14-9-10 yarmans or 209-132-154<br/>cents in my regular temperament. This I explain not to delve here into<br/>some of your following comments which we should explore further when<br/>you have had a chance to reply to this message, Inshallah, but to shed<br/>some perspective on your concluding remark.</p><p>&gt;  That is the necessary cadence for Sazkar or Sazkar-i Jedid.  But<br/>&gt;  what is that? At this very moment, a wily efreet knocked off the<br/>&gt;  lid of my metronome in the other room where it started to tick-tock<br/>&gt;  loudly.

Rather I would entreat that it be taken as a<br/>pleasant diversion of the reason and senses, one sign of the<br/>exuberance of a Renaissance, and here a Zalzalian Renaissance seeking<br/>to honor the Mutazilah way of logic and art.</p><p>And to your guest, I would make a humble offering of my music and<br/>theory, however uninformed or inept, as a gift meant to impart some<br/>small measure of _tarab_ or enchantment which the infinite variety of<br/>neutral or Zalzalian steps can bring; and as a gentle signpost,<br/>however wayward my seyir, toward the best seyir, which is toward<br/>Allah, or ha-Shem as we often also say in the Jewish tradition, the<br/>compassionate giver of all good things including the wonders of music.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
