That&apos;s never been a question.  I think<br/>&gt; most of us greatly appreciate what you&apos;ve been doing,<br/>&gt; and we&apos;re happy to see that all your pages have a new home.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now they need to be *indexed* from your home page, and...<br/>&gt; [just joking...]</p><p>well, i think you&apos;re only saying &quot;just joking&quot; because<br/>i&apos;ve been complaining about how much  work this is.<br/>but actually, i&apos;ve finally already started creating an<br/>&quot;index&quot; page, which will alphabetically list every single<br/>term, person, tuning, and composition that appears on the<br/>Sonic Arts site, my site, and in the Tuning Dictionary.</p><p>as soon as it has a little more than the Tuning Dictionary<br/>index, which i&apos;m using as a starting point, i&apos;ll upload it.<br/>it should make it *MUCH* easier to navigate thru the<br/>vast labyrinth that my website has become.  doing all this<br/>housecleaning now, *i&apos;m* even rediscovering some pages<br/>i wrote that i forgot about!</p><p>-monz<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
