Changing<br/>the tuning to a just diatonic would ruin the &quot;momentum&quot; these tones generate. It is a shame<br/>that the so much of the Celtic music has degenerated into 12 et. but then again it was a<br/>highly surpressed music. I wonder how much of the history of this music is in Groves?<br/>Especially from spain.</p><p>Rick Tagawa wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was just reading Curt Sachs&apos; &quot;Some Aspects of Musicology&quot; and I<br/>&gt; thought I should share a few excerpts with the group.

Our notes deceive us: performance style, which they cannot<br/>&gt; express, counts for more than the bald arrangement of steps that they<br/>&gt; set forth.  How dare we suppose that the Christian Spaniards and<br/>&gt; Proven&iuml;&iquest;&half;als sheared the Moorish melodies of all their characteristic<br/>&gt; traits!  Incidentally, one picture, and a very late one, provides a<br/>&gt; strange confirmation: in the famous altarpiece of Ghent (c. 1425, that<br/>&gt; is, in the time of Dufay), van Eyck painted the singing angels grouped<br/>&gt; around St. Cecilia with, above the nose, the quite un-European but<br/>&gt; typically Oriental creases which result from nasal singing and which we<br/>&gt; find so often five thousand years ago in the portraits of Egyptian<br/>&gt; singers and in the living Orient of today.  (Commerical photos of the<br/>&gt; altar seldom show this detail.)  [Sachs, Curt &quot;The Lore of Non-Western<br/>&gt; Music&quot; in Some Aspects of Musicology,&quot; Three Essays by . . .

Pratt, The Liberal Arts Press, New<br/>&gt; York, 1957, p26]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Feeling the impact of Oriental music, a few persons began to realize<br/>&gt; that Western music was not unlimited.  It dawned upon some<br/>&gt; musicologists, perhaps for the first time, that our great achievements<br/>&gt; in harmony, polyphony, and orchestration had involved sacrifices in<br/>&gt; other fields; that Europe had compressed into the conventional major and<br/>&gt; minor the incredible richness of melodic types and modes that still<br/>&gt; flourished in the East; that the West&apos;s even, unalterable semitones,<br/>&gt; forced into a uniform &quot;equal temperament,&quot; had supplanted a wealth of<br/>&gt; variable tunings.  Under the strait jacket of harmonic motion our melody<br/>&gt; had become a poor device connecting related chords, while Western<br/>&gt; rhythm, its counterpart infinitely subtle in the East, had degenerated<br/>&gt; into a system that did little more than mark binary or tenary accent<br/>&gt; groups.
