My knowledge of Turkish music is<br/>       mostly limited to your Phd thesis and the few internet sites<br/>       which I have recently posted. The best thing that I can say<br/>       is that some people try to simplify music systems in order to<br/>       make them more practical while other people try to complicate<br/>       music systems in order to make them more accurate. Eighty<br/>       years ago some revisionist policies made sense to some people<br/>       but not to others. Now home computers can implement the most<br/>       fastidiously accurate tunings but singers still suffer from<br/>       the same old limitations when trying to reproduce more than<br/>       about 24 (or perhaps 31) notes to the octave.</p></div><h3><a id=78185 href="#78185">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2008 1:26:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Robert, I would like very much to hear your thoughts<br/>&gt; regarding the quotes starting from page 145 of the PDF file.
