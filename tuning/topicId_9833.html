In addition to the non-standard<br/>&gt; fretting patterns, which are tempered so that the frets run straight<br/>&gt; across the neck but which are quite close to many JI ratios, the open<br/>&gt; strings are also tuned to quasi-JI pitches.</p><p>Hope you&apos;re settling well in San Diego, Joe! Could you describe Perry&apos;s<br/>piece in a more detailed way? Is there a score available somewhere? Thanks.</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
