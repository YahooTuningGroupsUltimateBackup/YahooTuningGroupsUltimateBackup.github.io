Shaahin Mohajeri left his music  without any special notation,<br/>as we had to memorize the differences for each  note...and there were<br/>written chromatic changes that did not change pitch.   But it became just one<br/>more notation.  Trouble with 72 is I can and want to  go deeper.  A single cent<br/>is my threshold of pitch acuity  discrimination.  HEWM, no.</p><p>Johnny</p><p>Johnny, have you messed with HEWM or some  other 72-tet based notation<br/>at all?
