It&apos;s so many of the great unwashed that<br/>&gt; want to lump his work back into the world of concert hall, the<br/>&gt; tyranny of the proscenium arch.</p><p>I&apos;ve already surrendered -<br/>see my concession to Kraig Grady in &apos;replies to TD 182&apos;.</p><p>You know, I was thinking, with the limitation on performances<br/>of Partch&apos;s music which is the result of maintaining this<br/>position, what we really need in order to preserve it, is<br/>publication of good, quality scores of his compositions.</p><p>We&apos;ve already got the guide to building the instruments,<br/>as long as _Genesis_ stays in print.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried to read the info at the Schott website about<br/>the supposed publication of Partch scores, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to exist there anymore.  I had trouble finding it anyway.</p><p>I&apos;m really interested in this, because I&apos;ve thought that<br/>the prime-factor notation I use would be ideal for this,<br/>perhaps printing the left-hand page in Partch&apos;s actual<br/>&apos;tablature&apos; notation, and the prime-factor notation<br/>(i.e., &apos;sort-of regular&apos; staff notation) on the right-side page.</p><p>For an example of the type of staff notation I&apos;m talking about,<br/>[plug alert] see the Robert Johnson transcription on my site:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;ve included in my book a transcription in this notation of<br/>Partch&apos;s _Li-Po Lyric_ &apos;The Intruder&apos;, and I think it works<br/>well to convey the pitch contents of Partch&apos;s scores, for<br/>purposes of musical analysis.</p><p>His own tablature notation, of course, preserves a sense of<br/>how it is to play his music on his own instruments, which would<br/>certainly be an important part of a Partch score, and is<br/>something I&apos;d want to preserve in its publication.</p><p>If no one else is interested in doing it like this, I&apos;d like<br/>to know about necessary permissions for publishing Partch<br/>scores myself thru our Sonic Arts Press.</p><p>Joseph L.
