Since 65/64 equates 8/5 with 13/8, we have a whole range between 814 and 840 cents that will be more-or-less concordant, and we can adjust the generator chain to favor 8/5 at one end and 13/8 at the other, ranging from a 240-cent generator (of 10-ED2) to a 225-cent generator (of 16-ED2), centered of course on the ~232-cent generator that&apos;s TE-optimal.  I&apos;m not quite sure how to apply this in scale-making, but supposing we wanted to come up with some kind of 16-tone music theory, this would be a good candidate that could include 16-ED2 as a &quot;simple but inaccurate&quot; tuning (analogous to meantone in 12-TET), 26-ED2 as a &quot;more accurate but more complex&quot; tuning (analogous to meantone in 19-TET), 10-ED2 as an &quot;over-simplified&quot; tuning (analogous to meantone in 7-TET), and of course a host of well-temperaments and adaptive JI schemes to really dial in the concordance.</p><p>This is probably the best we&apos;ll be able to do for a system that has some plausible relation to 16-ED2.

The 2.5.7.13.19 16&amp;20 temperament makes more sense and leads to the same scale in 16-TET.  Armodue is probably too controversial; a lot of people like it, a lot of people think the fifths are too far off.  Even I think the fifths are too far off, although I occasionally get in a gamelanesque mood and enjoy the beating.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2012 12:51:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jan 13, 2012 at 11:13 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...t&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thinking about how to get 16 notes to an octave to decently circulate, it occurred to me to look at 3/2-3/2-10/7-3/2-3/2-10/7-3/2-3/2-10/7-3/2-3/2-10/7-3/2-3/2-10/7-3/2.
