David renders his Just<br/>&gt; Intonation<br/>&gt; guitar synthesizer music using a conventionally fretted 12-ET solidbody<br/>&gt; electric but using only the MIDI pickup output. His synth modules then<br/>&gt; respond in a chosen JI scale. &apos;Temple&apos; uses a 19-limit scale that I believe<br/>&gt; was first used by Wendy Carlos; 1/1, 17/16, 9/8, 19/16, 5/4, 21/16, 11/8,<br/>&gt; 3/2, 13/8, 27/16, 7/4,15/8. This scale offers (to me) a particularly vivid<br/>&gt; mix of consonance and dissonance, a mix that Beardsley used subtly in this<br/>&gt; very slowly unfolding (hour-plus) exploration.</p><p>It&apos;s just the harmonic series, I didn&apos;t use it for<br/>a few years. In the early years of my work with ji,<br/>I used it all the time. I got it out of the Scott<br/>Wilkinson book years ago and I thought it was time<br/>to revisit it.</p><p>As for who used it first, I&apos;m sure La Monte Young<br/>and Ben Johnston used it before she did.</p><p>And while that is the right scale, I don&apos;t use<br/>21/16 or 15/8 in Temple In The Ear.</p><p>&gt;        I don&apos;t know Beardsley&apos;s influences in this field but I heard much<br/>&gt; more of  Indian music than Klaus Schulze, more of La Monte Young than Star&apos;s<br/>&gt; End. Overall, it was a thoroughly involving and convincing performance.</p><p>Thanks for the nice review Bob and thanks for coming<br/>to the show!</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
