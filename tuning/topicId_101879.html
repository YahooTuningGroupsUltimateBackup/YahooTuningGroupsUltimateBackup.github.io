The Ellis duodene is the Euler genus derived from the divisors of 27*25 = 675, reduced to an octave. Tempering this in 7-limit marvel (225/224 tempering) or 11-limit marvel (225/224 and 385/384 tempering) leads to the marveldene. However, there is no appreciable tuning damage from adding 325/324, leading to hecate temperament, so this can be considered to be the marveldene also.</p><p>The hecate version is interesting because of its connection to the hexad, 1-9/8-5/4-7/5-14/9-7/4, in hecate tempering:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/hecate+hexad">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/hecate+hexad</a></p><p>The marveldene consists of two hecate hexads a fifth apart.</p></div>
