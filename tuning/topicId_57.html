Has anyone else tried this?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Visit the Microtonal Synthesis web site at <a href="http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/">http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/</a><br/>for information on digital pianos with tuning capabilities.  It lists<br/>current digital pianos from Korg, Technics and Yamaha with user tuning<br/>tables.  There may be many more models with tuning tables, but as you&apos;ve<br/>found, this information is not easy to come by.</p><p>Technically any XG or GS instrument should support the tuning extensions,<br/>but since I&apos;ve heard Yamaha and Roland say that their &quot;standards&quot; don&apos;t<br/>require the implementation of all features, you always take the risk that<br/>they omitted the tuning tables from some products, though I haven&apos;t heard of<br/>a specific instance of this.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:jloffink@pdq.net">jloffink@pdq.net</a><br/><a href="http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/">http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/</a><br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/1999 1:54:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; (I just subscribed to this list recently, and I&apos;m not sure if the top-<br/>&gt; ic for this post is appropriate to the list.<br/>&gt; I am a college student planning on getting a digital piano for my dorm<br/>&gt; room.</p><p>   I&apos;d say that that&apos;s plenty appropriate!

I don&apos;t<br/>know yet about Yamaha, but I&apos;m leaning toward getting a Generalmusic<br/>RealPiano PRO Expander instead, which supports tuning each key individu-<br/>ally over the entire MIDI range.
