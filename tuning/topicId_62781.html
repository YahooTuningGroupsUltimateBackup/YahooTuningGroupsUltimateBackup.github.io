A harmonic series segment, to my ears, provides a particularly stable -- if not static -- set of pitches from which to work in this way. Moreover, it seems to me that strategic use of inversions, for example, gradually allowing the more complex relationship to come into play (i.e. letting the 11, 13, 17, 19 emerge in the bass) can create some rather dynamic large scale structures that would be inaudible in a tempered rendition.
