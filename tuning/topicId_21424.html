I have read that<br/>&gt; page 20 times and I still don&apos;t understand it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it possible, Monz, to describe your Just system in some kind<br/>&gt; of terms so that somebody like me can understand it??  It seems<br/>&gt; a little obfuscatory...</p><p>OK - but *you* are therefore the one responsible for the length of<br/>*this* post!</p><p>:-P</p><p>Hopefully, I&apos;ve become a better writer in the 6 years that<br/>have passed since I originally wrote that paper:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm</a></p><p>Actually, my own personal system is extremely simple if the<br/>prime-factor accidentals are simply used to accompany regular<br/>12-EDO (= 12-tET) notation.  (But these accidentals can also be<br/>used in conjunction with more sophisticated or more complex<br/>staff-notations... more on that at the end of this post.)</p><p>One simply adds the list of prime-factors and their appropriate<br/>exponents before the note-head of a regular 12-EDO pitch according<br/>to either of two ways:</p><p>1. The 12-EDO pitch is determined according to a system based on<br/>     the pitches I define as representing each succesive prime-<br/>     limit.  For example, if &quot;middle-C&quot; is our reference n^0<br/>     (= 1/1 ratio), I call 5^1 &quot;E&quot;, 7^1 &quot;Bb&quot;, 11^1 &quot;F#&quot;, 13^1 &quot;Ab&quot;,<br/>     17^1 &quot;Db&quot;, 19^1 &quot;D#&quot;, and so on (... my JI music often stays<br/>     within 19-limit).</p><p>     Letter-names of pitches arrived at thru expansion in any of<br/>     those dimensions can be easly determined by applying the<br/>     same mathematics consistently: so 5^1 7^1 goes with &quot;D&quot;,<br/>     7^1 11^1 goes with &quot;E&quot;, etc.</p><p>     I like this system because the letter-names correspond<br/>     to those that are familiar from any serious study of<br/>     traditional triadic harmony.</p><p>     Note, however, that because both 7^1 and 11^1 are so far from<br/>     their 12-EDO representations (~31 and ~49 cents respectively),<br/>     this last example is actually much closer to the 12-EDO Eb in<br/>     pitch (in fact at ~320 cents it&apos;s nearly a 6/5).  This is an<br/>     inconsistency, not in the sense of Erlich&apos;s definition of<br/>     consistency, but definitely still some kind of inconsistency<br/>     in terms of what those letter-names are supposed to mean.<br/>     (Perhaps Paul will elaborate on this.)  Therefore...</p><p>2. It might be preferable to simply use the 12-EDO pitch that is<br/>     nearest to the pitch defined by the ratio.  This will<br/>     definitely result in Erlichian inconsistencies in a few<br/>     places, but generally should work well; seems to me it would<br/>     be better than the incongruous example I describe above<br/>     (320-cent &quot;E&quot;).</p><p>     This would result in a situation somewhat like Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>     use of the most easily-readable notation for highly chromatic<br/>     music: i.e., he might spell a chord G#:C:Eb instead of the<br/>     traditional way of recognizing triadic harmony by using<br/>     G#:B#:D#.</p><p>     I never really liked this method because of my disagreement<br/>     with Schoenberg on this, but might shift to it after all to<br/>     avoid the incongruities discussed above.</p><p>     (Hmmm... if that type of &quot;congruity/incongruity&quot; is different<br/>     enough from Erlich&apos;s &quot;consistency/inconsistency&quot; concept,<br/>     maybe I have another new tuning term to define... Paul, help!)</p><p>For a rather extreme example of how my accidentals work: if<br/>&quot;middle-C&quot; is our reference n^0 (= 1/1), then a note whose pitch<br/>is a 35:33 above it would have as prime-factors 3^-1  5^1  7^1<br/>11^-1, and would be attached to the letter-name &quot;Db&quot;, because a<br/>3:2 below C (= 3^-1) is &quot;F&quot;, a 5:4 above that is &quot;A&quot;, a 7:4 above<br/>that is &quot;G&quot;, and an 11:8 below that is &quot;Db&quot;.  The cent value is<br/>~102 cents, so in this particular case either method (of the two<br/>listed above) works equally well.</p><p>(I deliberately chose this ratio because it&apos;s a sort of perverse<br/>distortion of why I decided on prime-factor notation in the first<br/>place; that is, the prime-factor accidental is longer/bigger than<br/>the ratio.  Here&apos;s a converse example that shows precisely *why*<br/>I like this notation so much: if &quot;C&quot; is 1/1, then 1148175/720896<br/>would be 3^8 5^2 7^1 &quot;Cx&quot;.  Which one is easier for *you* to<br/>understand? ... I thought so!)</p><p>In my scores I don&apos;t have to follow the ASCII conventions that<br/>are necessary here on the Tuning List, so the accidental itself<br/>is a little more compact than what I write here.  The exponents<br/>are small superscript numbers attached to the prime-factors (as<br/>demonstrated in my article and book), and I don&apos;t need so much<br/>space between them to keep them separated.  Normally when we give<br/>the prime-factorization here on the list we also add the<br/>multiplication sign &quot;*&quot; between each set of factors to show the<br/>relevant mathematical operation.</p><p>The way I write the accidentals in the score (i.e., with<br/>superscripts for the exponents), I can follow the regular<br/>algebraic convention of simply butting the terms up against<br/>each other to show multiplication, and eliminating any extra<br/>multiplication symbol.  This makes the whole accidental symbol<br/>more compact.</p><p>Perhaps some of the difficulty you are having understanding my<br/>system, Joe, is that in my article and book I also mention another<br/>way of using the same concept, where one may dispense with the<br/>prime-factors themselves in the accidental, and indicate only<br/>the values of the exponents; so that, for example, the 35:33<br/>illustrated above would be rendered as -1 1 1-1.  This should<br/>be very familiar to anyone who&apos;s made use of the vector notation<br/>of the prime-factors, because that&apos;s exactly what it is, without<br/>the enclosing parentheses or brackets that are usually included.</p><p>Using this method, it is understood that each successive number<br/>represents the exponent of a prime in the prime series, starting<br/>with 3 on the left and continuing thru 5, 7, 11 (as in this<br/>example) and beyond to 13, 17, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, etc.,<br/>if more places are used.</p><p>It is necessary to include the use of zero as a place-holder when<br/>using this method, whereas when the prime-factors are included as<br/>in the earlier examples using the other method, those factors with<br/>a value of zero can be omitted entirely.</p><p>I find that the version which includes the prime-factor and omits<br/>those factors with a zero exponent is usually more compact and<br/>therefore more useful for actual staff-notation, because in any<br/>given section of a composition, most ratios have only a few (1, 2,<br/>or 3) factors, thus there is no need to have long strings of zeros<br/>in the accidental.  All of the actual musical examples in my book,<br/>and all of my scores written in prime-factor notation, use this<br/>method.</p><p>The vector method is more useful when creating tables of pitches<br/>in an entire scale (as when I enter exponents into cells on a<br/>spreadsheet to create a lattice diagram), or for use in computer<br/>algorithms.</p><p>&gt; I will try to find the Perspectives article on Ben Johnston&apos;s<br/>&gt; notation... although I am beginning to doubt that it is as<br/>&gt; &quot;direct&quot; as these &quot;improved&quot; systems.</p><p>I can guarantee that you&apos;ll only become comfortable with<br/>Johnston&apos;s notation if you are a hard-core 5-limit JI enthusiast<br/>with a healthy interest in memorizing lattice diagrams.  :)</p><p>If you&apos;re not, then read those _Perpectives_ articles to get the<br/>superficial understanding of Johnston&apos;s system that you feel you<br/>need as a minimum, put them in your library for future reference<br/>if that need arises, and move on.</p><p>If you&apos;re having trouble understanding how Johnston&apos;s notation<br/>works in 5-limit, multiply that difficulty by each new dimension<br/>you add to the lattice with each new prime-factor.  :(   Even tho<br/>his accidentals for all prime-factors higher than 5 follow more<br/>logical rules, that problemmatic 2-dimensional basic scale pattern<br/>is replicated in every other added dimension.  (I&apos;ll go into more<br/>detail on this below.)</p><p>If you&apos;re not interested in analyzing Johnston&apos;s (or his<br/>students&apos;s) music, and not interested in composing music like<br/>theirs, forget about that notational system, other than for<br/>having knowledge of it for general purposes.  If your primary<br/>purpose is to learn a useful new tool for use in composing your<br/>own extended JI music, work with the HEWM Helmholtz/Ellis/Wolf/<br/>Monzo] notation instead.  (This newly-coined acronym has just<br/>been added to my Tuning Dictionary.)</p><p>(With all this negativity, I should probably remind everyone here<br/>that I have the utmost respect for just about everything else<br/>Johnston has written, musical or theoretical, and that I value<br/>his friendship highly.  I just don&apos;t like his notation, even tho<br/>it *was* the catalyst that finally gave me the insight into how<br/>to develop *my* system to adapt staff-notation for JI, and so I<br/>still appreciate it for that reason too.)</p><p>&gt; The reason, though, that I am so interested in it is, obviously,<br/>&gt; Johnston&apos;s stature as a composer and xenharmonic thinker and the<br/>&gt; usage of such composers as Doty and Gann...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It can&apos;t just be &quot;overlooked...&quot;</p><p>Yes, Joe, that&apos;s exactly why I address this issue so strongly.<br/>Johnston was an influential teacher (he&apos;s retired now, composing<br/>full-time) who had a lot of students.  I feel that his notation<br/>is being accepted unquestioningly by a large (and ever-increasing)<br/>number of JI composers and theorists, and that if they put a<br/>little more thought into the problem, they too would probably<br/>prefer the HEWM system instead.  Paul Erlich advocates HEWM over<br/>Johnston ... and you can be sure that *his* is not an uncritical<br/>opinion!  :)</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21387">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21387</a></p><p>&gt; perhaps it would be best to go for &quot;Monzotone&quot; rather than<br/>&gt; Wolf... since I am in more frequent communication with you...</p><p>Well, that sure makes sense.  I&apos;ve put a lot of thought into the<br/>microtonal notations that suit my particular uses, and it would<br/>really make me happy to see my proposals adopted by others here<br/>who share similar concerns.  And I&apos;m around here a lot, always<br/>available to provide help when it&apos;s requested.</p><p>In brief, some of my preferences are:</p><p>- Helmholtz/Ellis/Wolf/Monzo (HEWM) prime-factor notation for<br/>   any-prime-limit extended JI.  Extremely useful as an analytical<br/>   tool, as it can represent clearly *any* rational system than can<br/>   be devised.  Just about the only sensible way to notate very-<br/>   high-prime music (i.e., La Monte Young&apos;s) on a staff. (Example<br/>   near the end of my book.)</p><p>- Sims 72-EDO notation for up to 17-limit JI, with subsets that<br/>    work fine for 48-, 36-, 24-, 18-, 12-, 9-, and 8-EDO notations<br/>    and/or tunings.  (My ASCII adaptation of 72-EDO is great for<br/>    Tuning List posts.)</p><p>- Stearns/Sims 144-EDO for the type of poly-EDOs division of the<br/>   pitch-continuum favored by Dan Stearns, or for cases of JI<br/>   music where the context demands smaller-than-72-EDO accuracy<br/>   (as in my piece _A Noiseless Patient Spider_).</p><p>All three of these are intended to function as representations of<br/>the infinite pitch continuum, whose subdivisions make up the scales<br/>and harmonies that we analyze in various musical pieces or<br/>performances.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21267.html#21394">/tuning/topicId_21267.html#21394</a></p><p>&gt; Quote from Johnny Reinhard:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Cents makes the most sense:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1200 divisions of the octave being the very threshold of human<br/>&gt; hearing for pitch differentiation.  Additionally, cents allows<br/>&gt; for the total intellectualization of all pitch &quot;points&quot; on the<br/>&gt; line of frequency to be immediately apprehended.  Most<br/>&gt; importantly, players always reference new pitches to constants<br/>&gt; -- like open strings and harmonics --  in order to find exotics.<br/>&gt; Microtonal notations that represent moving relationships can<br/>&gt; lose their constants in pitch drift, making it difficult to come<br/>&gt; up with the necessary hand positions or fingerings to produce<br/>&gt; the appropriate sounds.  The solution is for all pitches to<br/>&gt; relate in a unified field in order to be fully prescriptive for<br/>&gt; players.   Cents also anchors us to present music tradition --<br/>&gt; no small feat.  Of course, by using enharmonic quartertones,<br/>&gt; one need not use numbers larger than 25 to indicate cents<br/>&gt; distinctions (recently pointed out by Paul Erlich, a subscriber<br/>&gt; to the internet&apos;s busy Tuning List).&quot;</p><p>Johnny makes an important point here: that his 12-EDO system<br/>is a closed one, whereas the HEWM system is not.</p><p>If I were as heavily involved in the practical side of<br/>polymicrotonal music-making as Johnny Reinhard, I&apos;d probably like<br/>his 1200-EDO notation a lot too.  This system is also intended by<br/>Johnny and his followers to function as a representation of the<br/>infinite pitch continuum.</p><p>But since I generally prefer to think of cents with the decimal<br/>point made manifest (as in my use of Semitones... see my<br/>Dictionary entry), 1200-EDO is more accurate than necessary for<br/>my *practical* purposes.  (Of course, I use 1200-EDO, as cents,<br/>all the time in my theoretical work.)</p><p>I believe that it&apos;s unlikely that live performance on non-fixed-<br/>pitch instruments is more accurate than +/- 5 cents anyway, so<br/>that would make 240-EDO good enough.  Since I already use 144-EDO,<br/>with its great properties of multiple subdivision (into 72-, 48-,<br/>36-, 24-, 18-, 16-, 12-, 9-, 8-, 6-, 4-, 3-, and 2-EDO) and an<br/>accuracy of 8-&amp;-1/3 cents, 144-EDO is good enough for me.  It<br/>also gives pretty good representations of 11-, 13-, 29-, 47-, and<br/>49-EDO, and a few on either side of 72-EDO, so it&apos;s handy for<br/>exploring Stearns-like uses of the pitch-continuum.</p><p>The big advantage Johnny&apos;s 1200-EDO has over all other systems is<br/>that it harnesses the power and biological inherency of the decimal<br/>number system, and this is not something that can or should be<br/>easily dismissed.</p><p>Albeit limited, our hands and fingers are a built-in abacus.<br/>1200-EDO, thought of as (100*12)-EDO, is thus so easy to<br/>conceptualize and apply for musicians who have already become<br/>comfortable with 12-EDO that it&apos;s certainly the most quickly-<br/>learned representation of the infinite pitch continuum for a<br/>trained musician.  (And as I contend in my book, even without<br/>familiarity with 12-EDO, a musician dealing with a Pythagorean<br/>chromatic system would naturally tend to feel the &quot;octave&quot; as<br/>divided into 12 parts, because the Pythagorean Comma is 3^12.)</p><p>There is thus a fundamental difference between the way one<br/>understands 1200-EDO and, for example, 72- or 144-EDO.</p><p>72-/144-EDO is based on continuous subdivision of 12-EDO,<br/>similar to the way in the &quot;English&quot; system of linear measurement<br/>1 foot is divided into 12 inches, because 12 is easily divided<br/>into 2, 3, 4, or 6, so that people could think in terms of 1/2,<br/>1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 of a foot, or the way an hour is divided into<br/>60 minutes and a minute into 60 seconds, because 60 is even more<br/>readily divisible (believe it or not, this is actually a<br/>surviving relic of Sumerian mathematics, 5000 years ago).</p><p>1200-EDO, on the other hand, while not as easy to divide into<br/>fractional subsets, is a sort of &quot;metric system&quot; for dividing<br/>12-EDO.  So 72-/144-EDO is thus admittedly more difficult.</p><p>I would say that all other EDO divisions are even more difficult<br/>to comprehend intutively than 144-/72-/48-/36-/24-/18-/16-/12-<br/>etc.-EDO, because they use more unwieldy divisions of the &quot;octave&quot;<br/>than 12-EDO.  (Of course, any notation can become easy and<br/>familiar with repeated exposure and practice.)</p><p>Because of its relatively small size, 19-EDO is a good notational<br/>alternative to 12 that gives a good representation of meantone<br/>harmonic theory, the basis of the so-called &quot;common practice&quot;.</p><p>(Generally, &quot;standard&quot; theory/harmony texts already use a notation<br/>that is consistent with 19-EDO-as-1/4-comma-meantone, so all one<br/>needs to do to *hear* meantone in action as the foundation of<br/>European &quot;classical&quot; harmony is play the musical illustrations<br/>in these books in 19-EDO tuning!</p><p>Just don&apos;t try this with Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_... that<br/>one *requires* 12-EDO for realization of the music examples if<br/>one intends to follow Schoenberg&apos;s line of argument properly to<br/>the end of the book.  The ability to use 19-EDO effectively for<br/>the European &quot;classical&quot; repertoire begins to break down with<br/>Beethoven&apos;s music, and with Wagner&apos;s music from _Tristan_ [1865]<br/>and after it won&apos;t work.)</p><p>The HEWM notation is more difficult still, because the prime-factor<br/>representation is even harder to conceptualize, but it is in many<br/>ways the most useful, especially for analyzing harmony if one<br/>accepts either (or both) the small-integer-ratio and/or the<br/>overtone-series-as-paradigm harmonic theories.</p><p>(Note that the latter, albeit oddly distorted because of his<br/>adherence to the errors of 12-EDO, was indeed Schoenberg&apos;s basis<br/>too.)</p><p>And I think Paul Erlich&apos;s 22-EDO decatonic notations are really<br/>ingenious and useful for those who work in that tuning.</p><p>Fokker&apos;s 31-EDO notation is good for exploring that EDO - and<br/>there&apos;s info about it on the web at<br/><a href="http://bikexprt.com/music/notation.htm">http://bikexprt.com/music/notation.htm</a></p><p>And Erv Wilson has devised a number of interesting microtonal<br/>notations for various-sized &quot;moduli&quot;, as he calls them (see his<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ articles, most of them available at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The only other EDO of real historical importance that I haven&apos;t<br/>covered is 53-EDO.  I&apos;d very much like to know more about<br/>notations for this, especially (if I&apos;m correct that he had one)<br/>Tanaka&apos;s.</p><p>... back to<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21387">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21387</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; In Johnston&apos;s notation, both the #/b *and* +/- accidentals<br/>&gt; &gt; *always* indicate an adjustment which includes *both*<br/>&gt; &gt; prime-factors 3 and 5, because his basic scale includes both.<br/>&gt; &gt; This is my primary difficulty with his system.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re saying, then, that it&apos;s not entirely clear what&apos;s implied<br/>&gt; when using either the #/b or +/- ??<br/>&gt;</p><p>NO!!!!!!</p><p>What&apos;s implied by the #/b or +/- in Johnston&apos;s notation is always<br/>*crystal clear*!</p><p>It&apos;s the 2-dimensional &quot;lattice shape&quot; of the *basic scale* that&apos;s<br/>faulty!</p><p>In both the Johnston and HEWM systems, every accidental in the<br/>system refers to an alteration in a specific set of dimensions,<br/>in lattice terms.</p><p>Differing fundamentally from the Johnston system in only one<br/>aspect, the HEWM notation uses a 1-dimensional scale (the 3-limit<br/>Pythagorean diatonic) as its basis.</p><p>But - this is another important difference - in the HEWM system,<br/>each unique prime-factor accidental above 3 moves the tuning only<br/>*one* exponent further along *that* axis! This is not the case<br/>with prime-factor 5 in Johnston&apos;s system.</p><p>The Johnston notation uses a 2-dimensional scale as its basis.<br/>So The #/b requires a shift of *two* degrees (exponents) along<br/>the 5-axis, because 25/24 == 3^-1 * 5^2.  This is a further<br/>complication.</p><p>Because the HEWM basic scale is 1-dimensional, and because all<br/>*required* accidentals (i.e., prime-factors above 3) follow the<br/>same consistent operation, the lattice movements of the<br/>alterations caused by every *required* accidental are<br/>*intuitively* easy to visualize once they are learned.  A<br/>huge advantage is that the basic scale doesn&apos;t have to be<br/>learned, because *it* follows the rules too.</p><p>This property of logical consistency also makes it easy to adapt<br/>HEWM notation to computer algorithms.  I wrote a bunch of small<br/>programs in Microsoft QBasic several years ago which worked great,<br/>once I figured out how to make QBasic understand the &quot;accidental<br/>rules&quot;.  The programs gave me printouts of lattices complete with<br/>the letter-name notation, so that I didn&apos;t have to figure that<br/>out for hundreds of notes.</p><p>Having made all that fuss about how the Johnston and HEWM systems<br/>differ in representing prime-factor 5, note that in both systems,<br/>accidentals representing exponents of 3 do not follow the rule of<br/>increasing the exponent by 1.  This is due to the use of different<br/>letter-names to represent different powers of 3.</p><p>Exponents of 3 never have to be designated explicitly in either<br/>system, (altho it is frequently useful to include them anyway<br/>in my version of HEWM), because the #/b and their extensions<br/>x/bb (and x#/bbb, xx/bbbb, and beyond, which are actually found<br/>in Johnston&apos;s music) carry with them implicit 3-limit lattice<br/>movements, in both systems.</p><p>However, in Johnston&apos;s system there is no specific way to<br/>identify *only* 3-limit movement by itself, because of the<br/>2-dimensional nature of the basic scale; the &quot;lower accidentals&quot;<br/>#/b and +/- *both* incorporate both prime-factors 3 *and* 5.</p><p>As Erlich has repeatedly pointed out, if one creates a 3-limit<br/>Pythagorean chain of 5ths in Johnston notation, plusses and<br/>minuses will have to be added to the accidentals with every few<br/>steps along the 3-axis as one expands away from the reference<br/>tone and towards either end of the linear system.</p><p>In the HEWM notation, strictly 3-limit movement is designated<br/>strictly by the &quot;cycle-of-5ths&quot; progression familiar to any<br/>musician who understands standard music notation.  Exponents<br/>of 3 are increased or decreased by 1 as one encounters each new<br/>letter-name in the &quot;cycle-of-5ths&quot;, and sharps and flats<br/>consistently mean an alteration of +/- 3^7 [= ~113.685 cents,<br/>the &quot;apotome&quot;] from the basic A B D C E F G Pythagorean diatonic<br/>pitches.  (It&apos;s advisable to use &quot;cycle&quot; here instead of &quot;circle&quot;,<br/>because in JI it&apos;s really a spiral instead of a circle.)  +/- are<br/>used *only* in connection with prime-factor 5.</p><p>Thus, another advantage in the HEWM system is that both types of<br/>Pythagorean semitones (the limma and apotome... look them up my<br/>Dictionary if you&apos;re not familiar) are easily notated in a<br/>systematic way, which is not the case with Johnston&apos;s system.<br/>This makes it much more useful for those who work a lot in<br/>Pythagorean tuning, as the historical Pythgorean origin of our<br/>notational system of letter-names, sharps, and flats is retained.</p><p>(Hmmm... Thinking about this right now makes me particularly<br/>interested in how this notation might be good for exploring<br/>microtonal aspects of Ives&apos;s music, if one accepts Johnny<br/>Reinhard&apos;s postulate that Ives preferred Pythgorean, which I&apos;m<br/>willing to entertain.  The basic notation gives Ives&apos;s basic<br/>Pythagorean scale, and the prime-factor accidentals using 5 and<br/>above would provide the basis for analysis of rational<br/>implications of Ives&apos;s occassionally-used 1/4- and 1/8-tones.)</p><p>The only way HEWM could have been made *entirely* consistent<br/>would have been to let the successive letter-names represent<br/>increasing/decreasing exponents of 3.  For example, this time<br/>let&apos;s let &quot;A&quot; = n^0 = 1/1, which was the situation when our<br/>European notation was first invented.</p><p>&quot;B&quot; would be 3^1 = 3/2,<br/>&quot;C&quot; would be 3^2 = 9/8,<br/>&quot;D&quot; would be 3^3 = 27/16,<br/>&quot;E&quot; would be 3^4 = 81/64,<br/>&quot;F&quot; would be 3^5 = 243/128,<br/>&quot;G&quot; would be 3^6 = 729/512.</p><p>From this point the system could probably just keep using the<br/>alphabet, not needing to invoke a sharp or flat until &quot;Z&quot; is<br/>reached.  Or, more probably, it would make sense to invoke the<br/>accidental to represent the Pythagorean comma [== 3^12 =<br/>531441/524288 = ~23.46 cents].  But both of these seem too<br/>bizarre to be useful to anyone who already knows regular notation.</p><p>(Note that some medieval theorists, such as Boethius, did use<br/>diagrams in their treatises which were labelled similarly to this,<br/>to explain monochord division.)</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21390">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21390</a></p><p>&gt; Well, the point is that I should KNOW the Johnston AND MonzoWolf<br/>&gt; system thoroughly as part of my xenharmonic studies... As my<br/>&gt; music evolves and develops more in these directions, I will,<br/>&gt; thereby, know the right kind of notation to use...  So some of<br/>&gt; this is a bit in the &quot;R&amp;D&quot; area...</p><p>I applaud this healthy catholic attitude, Joe.</p><p>Keep in mind what I wrote above: you&apos;ll probably only find<br/>Johnston&apos;s notation really useful yourself if you intend to work<br/>a lot in 5-limit JI, and you&apos;d better enjoy looking at lattices,<br/>because you&apos;ll have to use them constantly until you memorize them.</p><p>But by all means, if you&apos;re intrigued enough by Johnston&apos;s system,<br/>don&apos;t allow me to discourage you from learning it well and using it<br/>when you feel the need.  (But I always end up cursing it when I&apos;m<br/>working on Johnston&apos;s music...)</p><p>&gt; &gt; [Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt; &gt; Or you might even want to use 72-tET notation (if you&apos;re not<br/>&gt; &gt; moving across vast stretches of the lattice)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never had any trouble conceptializing 72-tET... and there is<br/>&gt; quite a bit of PRACTICAL literature out about it.  That&apos;s a LOT<br/>&gt; different, from a practical standpoint, than these &quot;comma based&quot;<br/>&gt; systems, in MY opinion...</p><p>On the contrary, Joe, once you understand how the HEWM notation<br/>works, you can apply it to the large literature of rational-tuning<br/>harmonic theory.</p><p>For just one example, Partch&apos;s entire book could be rewritten<br/>translating all the musical examples and pages filled with ratios<br/>into HEWM notation (and, of course, the associated lattice<br/>diagrams, all of which I would present as subsets implanted within<br/>the big 43-tone lattice).  That, to me, would make it *much*<br/>easier to grasp Partch&apos;s theories.  (This is a project that I<br/>actually hope to accomplish some day.)</p><p>So while it&apos;s true that there&apos;s not a lot published which actually<br/>already *uses* HEWM notation, it&apos;s very easy to adapt the notation<br/>to any rational system that *has* already been published, and<br/>there are tons of those, going back at least to the ancient Greeks<br/>if not further.</p><p>As I&apos;ve made clear here before, I totally agree with Paul Erlich<br/>about the utility of 72-EDO notation for a wide variety of<br/>microtonal applications, grounded in either JIs or ETs.  If I<br/>were doing a lot more composing than theorizing, I&apos;d probably be<br/>using it all the time.</p><p>I mentioned near the beginning that the HEWM system of accidentals<br/>can be easily combined with pitch-height notations more<br/>sophisticated than 12-EDO.</p><p>I like to combine the 72-EDO accidentals with my prime-factor<br/>accidentals when I use a regular 5-line staff, supplementing the<br/>sharps and flats of 12-EDO with +/-, &gt;/&lt;, and ^/v to indicate<br/>1/12-, 1/6-, and 1/4-tones respectively.  It helps give a clearer<br/>picture of the pitch-height of a given pitch.</p><p>In some cases, where the musical context demands recognition of<br/>pitch differences smaller than the 16-&amp;-2/3-cent basic step-size<br/>of 72-EDO (for example, as in my _A Noiseless Patient Spider_),<br/>I use my adaptation of Dan Stearn&apos;s 144-EDO notation (which itself<br/>is a simple adaptation of the Sims 72-EDO notation).</p><p>(In the copy of the score you have, Joe ...which is still the<br/>only one that exists  :) ...I didn&apos;t bother to specify the<br/>prime-factors, because the music was already realized on computer.<br/>Some day, I hope to get around to writing an accurate Monzo-<br/>notation score that could be used for live performance.)</p><p>Actually, given the ~5-cent acceptance of variability in intended<br/>intonation that I mentioned above, the 144-EDO notation, and<br/>usually even the 72-EDO notation, is accurate enough to ensure an<br/>intonationally-reasonable live performance of my music anyway.<br/>(Ezra Sims has written that when he listens to computer mock-ups<br/>of his 37-limit-JI pieces, tuned in both JI and 72-EDO, he can&apos;t<br/>hear a difference between the two.)</p><p>So the prime-factor accidentals in my scores are only really<br/>valuable for analytical purposes, to study my JI harmonic<br/>techniques, exactly as they&apos;re irreplaceable when analyzing<br/>someone else&apos;s harmony.</p><p>A more radical alternative I like is the notation I invented in<br/>connection with my work on my MIDI-file of Haba&apos;s _2nd Quartet_.<br/>I showed an example of this at my Microfest presentation.  Each<br/>semitone is represented by a staff-line, and the quartertones go<br/>in the spaces.  This gives the advantage of presenting the pitch-<br/>height graphical element of the notation quantized to the quarter-<br/>tone level.</p><p>Other accidentals can then also be added.  For example:</p><p>- 48-EDO could be easily represented by one accidental symbol, to<br/>    represent either the raising or lowering of any pitch by a<br/>    1/8-tone.</p><p>- 72-EDO could be represented very simply by using two more<br/>    symbols, to represent the raising and lowering of any pitch<br/>    by 1/12-tones.  See a very crude example of the 72-EDO scale<br/>    on the quarter-tone-based staff, and some 72-EDO quarter-<br/>    tone-based notations of segments of the harmonic series, here:<br/>    <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/72edo/72edo-on-qt.jpg">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/72edo/72edo-on-qt.jpg</a></p><p>- Prime-factor notation can be easily incorporated by simply<br/>    adding the prime-factor accidentals.</p><p>The quarter-tone-based notation simply gives a more accurate<br/>quantization of the pitch-height aspect of staff-notation.</p><p>There&apos;s one more important advantage to it, the disadvantage of<br/>which in our regualr staff-notation is often overlooked: it<br/>equalizes the meaning of the vertical spacing of the lines in<br/>the staff.</p><p>To modern sensibilities used to thinking in terms of<br/>logarithmically equal divisions of the pitch-continuum, regular<br/>staff notation has the defect that moving between a line and a<br/>space on the staff can mean either of two intervals: a semitone<br/>(between B:C and E:F) or a whole-tone (between A:B, C:D, D:E,<br/>F:G, and G:A).  Thus the correlation between the visual aspect<br/>and the musical meaning is not consistent.</p><p>This happened because staff-notation developed during the early<br/>part of the last millenium to represent diatonic music, which had<br/>a combination of semitones and whole-tones built into it, and the<br/>inventors of the notation simply didn&apos;t consider this inconsistency<br/>to be important.  The staff clearly made it much easier to remember<br/>and communicate music, and so it was quickly adopted and then used<br/>as the basis for most of the notational development which followed.</p><p>In my quarter-tone-based notation, the staff has a line missing<br/>at regular intervals on the page to represent each &quot;octave&quot; of &quot;C&quot;<br/>(Hmmm... maybe I should make it &quot;A&quot; instead, for even more logical<br/>consistency.).  This acts a separator for the staves, so that each<br/>staff covers the span of an &quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>Then there are two different thicknesses of lines: the thin lines<br/>represent the 12-EDO pitches of the white keys on the piano<br/>keyboard, and the thicker lines represent 12-EDO pitches of the<br/>black keys.  The spaces are for the quarter-tones, which thus<br/>never need accidental symbols.</p><p>Stretching the actual vertical space which represents an &quot;octave&quot;<br/>on the paper has another nice result:  I can stack an 8-&quot;octave&quot;<br/>pitch-height space onto one page (which equals one &quot;system&quot;, in<br/>music-score language), and have plenty of room to write several<br/>different parts legibly on the same system/page.  So the original<br/>score is simultaneously also a kind of &quot;reduction&quot; that shows the<br/>interrelationship of the different parts.  For an example, see my<br/>renotation of the first system of Haba&apos;s _2nd Quartet_ (with all<br/>four parts written on the same staff) at:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/monzo-qt-notation.jpg">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/monzo-qt-notation.jpg</a></p><p>(My quarter-tone-based staff is adapted from the new 12-EDO staff<br/>notation invented by Max Meyer in _The Musician&apos;s Arithmetic_<br/>[1929].</p><p>Schoenberg also invented a very interesting new 12-EDO notation<br/>which used a very compressed staff and so cannot be further<br/>adapted to microtonality.  But it makes a lot of sense for his<br/>12-EDO music.  The article, with illustrative examples, is in<br/>_Style and Idea_.)</p><p>Last note: one drawback of *all* of these systems is that they all<br/>assume &quot;octave&quot;-equivalence.  I haven&apos;t even begun to wrestle with<br/>the problem of notating non-&quot;octave&quot; scales.</p><p>I sure hope that helps, Joe (and anyone else who needed it).<br/>Took me all day to write it.  I basically rewrote a lot of<br/>what&apos;s in my old article.

Feel free to elaborate and I&apos;ll<br/>clarify what I can.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps some of the difficulty you are having understanding my<br/>&gt; system, Joe, is that in my article and book I also mention another<br/>&gt; way of using the same concept, where one may dispense with the<br/>&gt; prime-factors themselves in the accidental, and indicate only<br/>&gt; the values of the exponents; so that, for example, the 35:33<br/>&gt; illustrated above would be rendered as -1 1 1-1.  This should<br/>&gt; be very familiar to anyone who&apos;s made use of the vector notation<br/>&gt; of the prime-factors, because that&apos;s exactly what it is, without<br/>&gt; the enclosing parentheses or brackets that are usually included.</p><p>Vector notation is also covered in my _Gentle Introduction to<br/>Periodicity Blocks_.</p><p>&gt; Since I already use 144-EDO,<br/>&gt; with its great properties of multiple subdivision (into 72-, 48-,<br/>&gt; 36-, 24-, 18-, 16-, 12-, 9-, 8-, 6-, 4-, 3-, and 2-EDO) and an<br/>&gt; accuracy of 8-&amp;-1/3 cents, 144-EDO is good enough for me.  It<br/>&gt; also gives pretty good representations of 11-, 13-, 29-, 47-, and<br/>&gt; 49-EDO, and a few on either side of 72-EDO, so it&apos;s handy for<br/>&gt; exploring Stearns-like uses of the pitch-continuum.</p><p>I&apos;m puzzled by why you would focus so much attention on JI and ETs,<br/>which are the two &quot;extremes&quot; as it were, while<br/>ignoring &quot;intermediate&quot; systems. For example, meantone can&apos;t be<br/>adequately notated in 144-tET notation.

I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d call that &quot;consistent&quot; -- actually<br/>&gt; I&apos;d call it &quot;screwy&quot; from a melodic point of view -- which is<br/>&gt; probably the most important point of view to keep in mind when<br/>&gt; designing a notation (if nothing else, the musician has got to<br/>&gt; know whether she&apos;s going up or down!)</p><p>Yeah, I would never actually advocate a &quot;screwy&quot; system like this.</p><p>Just wanted to present it for the sake of completeness, because<br/>it struck me as very interesting how HEWM&apos;s treatment of 3<br/>differs from its treatment of all other prime-factors, which<br/>I suppose is simply confirmation that it is indeed &quot;Pythagorean<br/>based&quot;.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21457 href="#21457">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/23/2001 3:15:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_21424.html#21449">/tuning/topicId_21424.html#21449</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Paul.  Thanks for responding to this.  I&apos;m going to have to<br/>&gt; think more (when I have more time) about your consistency<br/>&gt; explanations, before I reply to them.  But here are some other<br/>&gt; responses:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The HEWM notation is more difficult still,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This was a strange leap, Monz . . . from 19-tET as meantone to<br/>&gt; &gt; HEWM.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You can&apos;t even notate meantone in HEWM.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well... In *my* version of HEWM you can - remember a while back<br/>&gt; when I asked you to show me how to factor meantone calculations?<br/>&gt; Well, those would be my accidentals.  But it&apos;s probably not<br/>&gt; worth it, as they would be full of fractions as well as exponents,<br/>&gt; IOW, ridiculously complicated.  But anyway, if you *have* to<br/>&gt; notate a meantone in HEWM, you can do it with my version.</p><p>I can&apos;t agree about the &quot;HEW&quot; part . . . but of course for the &quot;M&quot;<br/>part, M is correct . . . and yes, it would look ridiculously<br/>complicated, and not even be uniquely defined (remember, the<br/>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic only applies to _integers_).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; because the prime-factor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; representation is even harder to conceptualize, but it is in<br/>many<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ways the most useful, especially for analyzing harmony if one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; accepts either (or both) the small-integer-ratio and/or the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; overtone-series-as-paradigm harmonic theories.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I accept both but I reject HEWM for analysing music in the<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone era (roughly 1480-1720) because it would be forced to<br/>&gt; &gt; make notational distinctions with no musical meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmmm... I might disagree with you there, Paul.  HEWM would<br/>&gt; obviously not be entirely accurate without some kind of<br/>&gt; modification to take meantone into consideration, but the<br/>&gt; whole point of meantone was to give good approximations of<br/>&gt; prime-factor 5 while retaining some resemblance to the 3-limit<br/>&gt; scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seems to me that HEWM could be harnessed for use in analyzing<br/>&gt; this music, if for no other reason than its broad flexibility<br/>&gt; (I&apos;m thinking particularly of my version here).  For example,<br/>&gt; a high-prime factor could be invoked to give a close approximation<br/>&gt; to certain meantone intervals.  I&apos;ll have to think about it more,<br/>&gt; maybe come up with a few examples for you.</p><p>Please do. My example is the comma-pump sequence -- in HEW you&apos;d be<br/>forced to either have the progression drift or have a comma shift<br/>between the two occurences of D -- neither of which occur in the<br/>meantone rendition, and neither of which would have anything to do<br/>with anything going on in the mind of any meantone-era composer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My brain&apos;s too foggy at the moment... could you say a little<br/>&gt; on how to determine the closure of the 53-tone system?, because<br/>&gt; in a JI system that big, you *do* end up with small &quot;leftover&quot;<br/>&gt; intervals at the edges of the periodicity-block.</p><p>Well, as you might expect, there are several different ways to<br/>construct a 53-tone periodicity block . . . you need two 5-limit<br/>unison vectors . . . one pair of unison vectors that might have<br/>relevance for Johnston&apos;s first JI system is the schisma and the<br/>Mercator&apos;s comma. The former is 2 cents and the latter is less than 4<br/>cents . . . so the fifths and thirds straddling the edges of the<br/>block would be off by this amount . ..  so this 53-tone just system<br/>might be said to be indistinguishable from 53-tET in a performance<br/>setting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, if I recall correctly, I&apos;m going to have to add<br/>&gt; &gt; Larry Hanson to the list of notational &quot;renegades&quot; (including<br/>&gt; &gt; Johnston and Fokker) . . . Larry Hanson&apos;s 34-tET notation at<br/>&gt; &gt; least, and I would assume his 53-tET notation too, departed<br/>&gt; &gt; from the 5-limit HEWM-like notation normally proposed for<br/>&gt; &gt; these tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmmm...

Netscape<br/>won&apos;t let me quote from such a large post (!!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps some of the difficulty you are having understanding my<br/>&gt; system, Joe, is that in my article and book I also mention another<br/>&gt; way of using the same concept, where one may dispense with the<br/>&gt; prime-factors themselves in the accidental, and indicate only<br/>&gt; the values of the exponents; so that, for example, the 35:33<br/>&gt; illustrated above would be rendered as -1 1 1-1.  This should<br/>&gt; be very familiar to anyone who&apos;s made use of the vector notation<br/>&gt; of the prime-factors, because that&apos;s exactly what it is, without<br/>&gt; the enclosing parentheses or brackets that are usually included.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is exactly right... the use of the exponents thoroughly confused<br/>me...  In fact, THAT is the usage that I MOST remember about the<br/>system...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that the version which includes the prime-factor and omits<br/>&gt; those factors with a zero exponent is usually more compact and<br/>&gt; therefore more useful for actual staff-notation, because in any<br/>&gt; given section of a composition, most ratios have only a few (1, 2,<br/>&gt; or 3) factors, thus there is no need to have long strings of zeros<br/>&gt; in the accidental.  All of the actual musical examples in my book,<br/>&gt; and all of my scores written in prime-factor notation, use this<br/>&gt; method.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes... like I mentioned, I remember this vector approach best from<br/>your book.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I will try to find the Perspectives article on Ben Johnston&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; notation... although I am beginning to doubt that it is as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;direct&quot; as these &quot;improved&quot; systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can guarantee that you&apos;ll only become comfortable with<br/>&gt; Johnston&apos;s notation if you are a hard-core 5-limit JI enthusiast<br/>&gt; with a healthy interest in memorizing lattice diagrams.  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re not, then read those _Perpectives_ articles to get the<br/>&gt; superficial understanding of Johnston&apos;s system that you feel you<br/>&gt; need as a minimum, put them in your library for future reference<br/>&gt; if that need arises, and move on.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I just ordered the Fonville article from the 1991 Perspectives, and I<br/>feel it is a good addition to my library.  Even if the Johnston<br/>notation is somewhat &quot;flawed,&quot; it is certainly a noble attempt at<br/>notation.</p><p>Frankly, I am *very* interested in notation.  I know that David Doty<br/>says he ISN&apos;T... but then perhaps he isn&apos;t so interested in working<br/>with live instrumentalists... (??)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re not interested in analyzing Johnston&apos;s (or his<br/>&gt; students&apos;s) music, and not interested in composing music like<br/>&gt; theirs, forget about that notational system, other than for<br/>&gt; having knowledge of it for general purposes.  If your primary<br/>&gt; purpose is to learn a useful new tool for use in composing your<br/>&gt; own extended JI music, work with the HEWM Helmholtz/Ellis/Wolf/<br/>&gt; Monzo] notation instead.  (This newly-coined acronym has just<br/>&gt; been added to my Tuning Dictionary.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>This sounds reasonable...  HEWM works well.  I also affectionately<br/>call it &quot;Monzowolfellholz&quot; notation...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The reason, though, that I am so interested in it is, obviously,<br/>&gt; &gt; Johnston&apos;s stature as a composer and xenharmonic thinker and the<br/>&gt; &gt; usage of such composers as Doty and Gann...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It can&apos;t just be &quot;overlooked...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, Joe, that&apos;s exactly why I address this issue so strongly.<br/>&gt; Johnston was an influential teacher (he&apos;s retired now, composing<br/>&gt; full-time) who had a lot of students.  I feel that his notation<br/>&gt; is being accepted unquestioningly by a large (and ever-increasing)<br/>&gt; number of JI composers and theorists, and that if they put a<br/>&gt; little more thought into the problem, they too would probably<br/>&gt; prefer the HEWM system instead.</p><p>Paul made a good point that somebody&apos;s &quot;stature&quot; is a pretty bs<br/>reason for advocating what is intellectually specious.  Good call,<br/>Paul...  However, I felt like you did.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that sure makes sense.  I&apos;ve put a lot of thought into the<br/>&gt; microtonal notations that suit my particular uses, and it would<br/>&gt; really make me happy to see my proposals adopted by others here<br/>&gt; who share similar concerns.  And I&apos;m around here a lot, always<br/>&gt; available to provide help when it&apos;s requested.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Believe me, your commentary and assistance is VERY much appreciated.<br/>You are an amazing asset to the entire xenharmonic community!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The big advantage Johnny&apos;s 1200-EDO has over all other systems is<br/>&gt; that it harnesses the power and biological inherency of the decimal<br/>&gt; number system, and this is not something that can or should be<br/>&gt; easily dismissed.</p><p>That makes cents, literally...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Albeit limited, our hands and fingers are a built-in abacus.<br/>&gt; 1200-EDO, thought of as (100*12)-EDO, is thus so easy to<br/>&gt; conceptualize and apply for musicians who have already become<br/>&gt; comfortable with 12-EDO that it&apos;s certainly the most quickly-<br/>&gt; learned representation of the infinite pitch continuum for a<br/>&gt; trained musician.</p><p>I believe this too, and it has been proven to me.  They young lady in<br/>Moscow who performed my piece had NO rehearsals with me!  She just<br/>got the music, saw the cents notation and said to my friend Anton<br/>Rovner in Moscow, &quot;Oh, no problem... I know how to do this... I&apos;ve<br/>played this kind of music before...&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 72-/144-EDO is based on continuous subdivision of 12-EDO,<br/>&gt; similar to the way in the &quot;English&quot; system of linear measurement<br/>&gt; 1 foot is divided into 12 inches, because 12 is easily divided<br/>&gt; into 2, 3, 4, or 6, so that people could think in terms of 1/2,<br/>&gt; 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 of a foot, or the way an hour is divided into<br/>&gt; 60 minutes and a minute into 60 seconds, because 60 is even more<br/>&gt; readily divisible (believe it or not, this is actually a<br/>&gt; surviving relic of Sumerian mathematics, 5000 years ago).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1200-EDO, on the other hand, while not as easy to divide into<br/>&gt; fractional subsets, is a sort of &quot;metric system&quot; for dividing<br/>&gt; 12-EDO.  So 72-/144-EDO is thus admittedly more difficult.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is an interesting analogy...  I don&apos;t know if it holds up<br/>completely, but I &quot;liked&quot; it...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In both the Johnston and HEWM systems, every accidental in the<br/>&gt; system refers to an alteration in a specific set of dimensions,<br/>&gt; in lattice terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Differing fundamentally from the Johnston system in only one<br/>&gt; aspect, the HEWM notation uses a 1-dimensional scale (the 3-limit<br/>&gt; Pythagorean diatonic) as its basis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But - this is another important difference - in the HEWM system,<br/>&gt; each unique prime-factor accidental above 3 moves the tuning only<br/>&gt; *one* exponent further along *that* axis! This is not the case<br/>&gt; with prime-factor 5 in Johnston&apos;s system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Johnston notation uses a 2-dimensional scale as its basis.<br/>&gt; So The #/b requires a shift of *two* degrees (exponents) along<br/>&gt; the 5-axis, because 25/24 == 3^-1 * 5^2.  This is a further<br/>&gt; complication.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Monz... This really is a good explanation of the &quot;problem...&quot;</p><p>&gt; Because the HEWM basic scale is 1-dimensional, and because all<br/>&gt; *required* accidentals (i.e., prime-factors above 3) follow the<br/>&gt; same consistent operation, the lattice movements of the<br/>&gt; alterations caused by every *required* accidental are<br/>&gt; *intuitively* easy to visualize once they are learned.  A<br/>&gt; huge advantage is that the basic scale doesn&apos;t have to be<br/>&gt; learned, because *it* follows the rules too.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, Paul Erlich really showed this with just a few triads.  It&apos;s<br/>amazing what a few choice examples can do.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, in Johnston&apos;s system there is no specific way to<br/>&gt; identify *only* 3-limit movement by itself, because of the<br/>&gt; 2-dimensional nature of the basic scale; the &quot;lower accidentals&quot;<br/>&gt; #/b and +/- *both* incorporate both prime-factors 3 *and* 5.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Got it!</p><p>&gt; As Erlich has repeatedly pointed out, if one creates a 3-limit<br/>&gt; Pythagorean chain of 5ths in Johnston notation, plusses and<br/>&gt; minuses will have to be added to the accidentals with every few<br/>&gt; steps along the 3-axis as one expands away from the reference<br/>&gt; tone and towards either end of the linear system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I can see the problem almost &quot;visually...&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21390">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21390</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, the point is that I should KNOW the Johnston AND MonzoWolf<br/>&gt; &gt; system thoroughly as part of my xenharmonic studies... As my<br/>&gt; &gt; music evolves and develops more in these directions, I will,<br/>&gt; &gt; thereby, know the right kind of notation to use...  So some of<br/>&gt; &gt; this is a bit in the &quot;R&amp;D&quot; area...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I applaud this healthy catholic attitude, Joe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep in mind what I wrote above: you&apos;ll probably only find<br/>&gt; Johnston&apos;s notation really useful yourself if you intend to work<br/>&gt; a lot in 5-limit JI, and you&apos;d better enjoy looking at lattices,<br/>&gt; because you&apos;ll have to use them constantly until you memorize them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But by all means, if you&apos;re intrigued enough by Johnston&apos;s system,<br/>&gt; don&apos;t allow me to discourage you from learning it well and using it<br/>&gt; when you feel the need.  (But I always end up cursing it when I&apos;m<br/>&gt; working on Johnston&apos;s music...)<br/>&gt;</p><p>It seems like the references will be important additions to my<br/>library... to sit under the bust of Haydn and, hopefully, only<br/>visited at &quot;odd&quot; hours when I&apos;m feeling a bit &quot;ideosyncratic...&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; A more radical alternative I like is the notation I invented in<br/>&gt; connection with my work on my MIDI-file of Haba&apos;s _2nd Quartet_.<br/>&gt; I showed an example of this at my Microfest presentation.  Each<br/>&gt; semitone is represented by a staff-line, and the quartertones go<br/>&gt; in the spaces.  This gives the advantage of presenting the pitch-<br/>&gt; height graphical element of the notation quantized to the quarter-<br/>&gt; tone level.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other accidentals can then also be added.  For example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - 48-EDO could be easily represented by one accidental symbol, to<br/>&gt;     represent either the raising or lowering of any pitch by a<br/>&gt;     1/8-tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - 72-EDO could be represented very simply by using two more<br/>&gt;     symbols, to represent the raising and lowering of any pitch<br/>&gt;     by 1/12-tones.  See a very crude example of the 72-EDO scale<br/>&gt;     on the quarter-tone-based staff, and some 72-EDO quarter-<br/>&gt;     tone-based notations of segments of the harmonic series, here:<br/>&gt;     <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/72edo/72edo-on-qt.jpg">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/72edo/72edo-on-qt.jpg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Prime-factor notation can be easily incorporated by simply<br/>&gt;     adding the prime-factor accidentals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The quarter-tone-based notation simply gives a more accurate<br/>&gt; quantization of the pitch-height aspect of staff-notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s one more important advantage to it, the disadvantage of<br/>&gt; which in our regualr staff-notation is often overlooked: it<br/>&gt; equalizes the meaning of the vertical spacing of the lines in<br/>&gt; the staff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my quarter-tone-based notation, the staff has a line missing<br/>&gt; at regular intervals on the page to represent each &quot;octave&quot; of &quot;C&quot;<br/>&gt; (Hmmm... maybe I should make it &quot;A&quot; instead, for even more logical<br/>&gt; consistency.).  This acts a separator for the staves, so that each<br/>&gt; staff covers the span of an &quot;octave&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then there are two different thicknesses of lines: the thin lines<br/>&gt; represent the 12-EDO pitches of the white keys on the piano<br/>&gt; keyboard, and the thicker lines represent 12-EDO pitches of the<br/>&gt; black keys.  The spaces are for the quarter-tones, which thus<br/>&gt; never need accidental symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stretching the actual vertical space which represents an &quot;octave&quot;<br/>&gt; on the paper has another nice result:  I can stack an 8-&quot;octave&quot;<br/>&gt; pitch-height space onto one page (which equals one &quot;system&quot;, in<br/>&gt; music-score language), and have plenty of room to write several<br/>&gt; different parts legibly on the same system/page.  So the original<br/>&gt; score is simultaneously also a kind of &quot;reduction&quot; that shows the<br/>&gt; interrelationship of the different parts.  For an example, see my<br/>&gt; renotation of the first system of Haba&apos;s _2nd Quartet_ (with all<br/>&gt; four parts written on the same staff) at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/monzo-qt-notation.jpg">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/monzo-qt-notation.jpg</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>This is very cool and, actually, very &quot;electronically&quot; looking.

Maybe it&apos;s partially because I am so<br/>interested in notation AS IT RELATES to xenharmonic systems.  As we<br/>have seen in the Johnston, there is an implication that NOTATION CAN<br/>DETERMINE the nature of the writing!  In a way, it&apos;s a little like<br/>the criticism of MIDI composition that &quot;quantizes&quot; so much to a<br/>steady beat...  the &quot;convenience&quot; is there, and the tendency is<br/>to &quot;go with the flow...&quot;</p><p>So emphasis on notation, in it&apos;s systematic manifestations cannot AT<br/>ALL be minimized by anybody seriously trying to write this stuff...</p><p>&gt; Hopefully, I&apos;ve become a better writer in the 6 years that<br/>&gt; have passed since I originally wrote that paper:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>I wanted to tell you, Monz, that I have now read your post over a few<br/>times and it is ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDABLE, even the &quot;vector&quot; part.<br/>It&apos;s TOTALLY CLEAR.</p><p>May I PLEASE encourage you to have this introductory material up on<br/>the site demonstrating your Prime Factor notation (which I<br/>affectionately call &quot;Monzowolfellholtz.&quot;)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; All three of these are intended to function as representations of<br/>&gt; the infinite pitch continuum, whose subdivisions make up the scales<br/>&gt; and harmonies that we analyze in various musical pieces or<br/>&gt; performances.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I love, Monz, when you continually bring this up, since that is<br/>the &quot;excitement&quot; of Xenharmonics for me...  and your 1/4 tone<br/>notation has that kind of &quot;electronic&quot; look... which just means that<br/>that kind of notation has been generally associated with scores and<br/>pieces that are concerned with the entire sound spectrum.  (Think<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s Studie II... but that had its own tuning in, I believe,<br/>a non-octave scale...)</p><p>&gt; The big advantage Johnny&apos;s 1200-EDO has over all other systems is<br/>&gt; that it harnesses the power and biological inherency of the decimal<br/>&gt; number system, and this is not something that can or should be<br/>&gt; easily dismissed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Albeit limited, our hands and fingers are a built-in abacus.</p><p>You know, I even *forgot* about us having 10 fingers....  of course,<br/>perhaps we could have developed with a base 20 system, as well, if we<br/>had used our toes?? ...</p><p>&gt; 1200-EDO, thought of as (100*12)-EDO, is thus so easy to<br/>&gt; conceptualize and apply for musicians who have already become<br/>&gt; comfortable with 12-EDO that it&apos;s certainly the most quickly-<br/>&gt; learned representation of the infinite pitch continuum for a<br/>&gt; trained musician.  (And as I contend in my book, even without<br/>&gt; familiarity with 12-EDO, a musician dealing with a Pythagorean<br/>&gt; chromatic system would naturally tend to feel the &quot;octave&quot; as<br/>&gt; divided into 12 parts, because the Pythagorean Comma is 3^12.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>This ie exceptionally clear and it illustrates, as Johnny says,<br/>why &quot;cents make sense...&quot;</p><p>&gt; Because of its relatively small size, 19-EDO is a good notational<br/>&gt; alternative to 12 that gives a good representation of meantone<br/>&gt; harmonic theory, the basis of the so-called &quot;common practice&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Generally, &quot;standard&quot; theory/harmony texts already use a notation<br/>&gt; that is consistent with 19-EDO-as-1/4-comma-meantone, so all one<br/>&gt; needs to do to *hear* meantone in action as the foundation of<br/>&gt; European &quot;classical&quot; harmony is play the musical illustrations<br/>&gt; in these books in 19-EDO tuning!<br/>&gt;</p><p>I thought that 19-EDO was 1/3rd rather than 1/4 comma meantone... Am<br/>I confused about something??</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s implied by the #/b or +/- in Johnston&apos;s notation is always<br/>&gt; *crystal clear*!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the 2-dimensional &quot;lattice shape&quot; of the *basic scale* that&apos;s<br/>&gt; faulty!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In both the Johnston and HEWM systems, every accidental in the<br/>&gt; system refers to an alteration in a specific set of dimensions,<br/>&gt; in lattice terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Differing fundamentally from the Johnston system in only one<br/>&gt; aspect, the HEWM notation uses a 1-dimensional scale (the 3-limit<br/>&gt; Pythagorean diatonic) as its basis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But - this is another important difference - in the HEWM system,<br/>&gt; each unique prime-factor accidental above 3 moves the tuning only<br/>&gt; *one* exponent further along *that* axis! This is not the case<br/>&gt; with prime-factor 5 in Johnston&apos;s system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Johnston notation uses a 2-dimensional scale as its basis.<br/>&gt; So The #/b requires a shift of *two* degrees (exponents) along<br/>&gt; the 5-axis, because 25/24 == 3^-1 * 5^2.  This is a further<br/>&gt; complication.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is a really great explanation, Monz, of this Johnston problem!<br/>Thanks!</p><p>Your post is so fascinating, and so &quot;jam-packed&quot; that it required TWO<br/>responses from me as I&apos;ve been &quot;digesting&quot; it!</p><p>___________ ______ _______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=21528 href="#21528">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2001 1:12:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21424.html#21511\">/tuning/topicId_21424.html#21511\</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; All three of these are intended to function as representations<br/>&gt; &gt; of the infinite pitch continuum, whose subdivisions make up<br/>&gt; &gt; the scales and harmonies that we analyze in various musical<br/>&gt; &gt; pieces or performances.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I love, Monz, when you continually bring this up, since that<br/>&gt; is the &quot;excitement&quot; of Xenharmonics for me... and your 1/4 tone<br/>&gt; notation has that kind of &quot;electronic&quot; look... which just means<br/>&gt; that that kind of notation has been generally associated with<br/>&gt; scores and pieces that are concerned with the entire sound<br/>&gt; spectrum.

This makes it ~10.767-EDO,<br/>or just over 10-&amp;-3/4 equal steps per &quot;octave&quot;.  The basic<br/>step size is ~111 cents.</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking that I should point out that, after<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s microtonal experiments of 1908-9 and his decision<br/>to stick with 12-EDO, he thought of 12-EDO as a representation<br/>of the infinite pitch continuum, in the same way that those<br/>of us who use the microtonal notations I&apos;ve been describing<br/>think of *them*.  He simply quantized the continuum to 12 equal<br/>steps instead of using smaller (i.e., 72-EDO) or variable<br/>(i.e., HEWM or &quot;Monzowolfellholtz&quot;) divisions.</p><p>Reflecting on this, I&apos;d say that it&apos;s imperative to label this<br/>tuning as 12-EDO rather than 12-tET in connection with Schoenberg<br/>and his legions of followers.</p><p>By the time Schoenberg started writing &quot;atonal&quot; music in 1908,<br/>he was no longer really thinking of 12-EDO as a tempering of<br/>*clearly-implied* just-intonation intervals (the &quot;closer<br/>overtones&quot;, in Schoenberg&apos;s lingo), which was how it had<br/>always been used before.</p><p>It was still a tempering of just intervals according to<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s harmonic thinking, but he emphasized that during<br/>this stage of his writing he was thinking exclusively in terms<br/>of the &quot;more remote overtones, which are not as easily<br/>comprehensible as the closer ones&quot; (paraphrased from<br/>_Harmonielehre_ [1911]).</p><p>So it was really a way of using the 12-EDO tuning to vaguely<br/>represent *any* subset of the virtual pitch continuum that the<br/>composer wished to use.  That&apos;s precisely how Schoenberg<br/>thought of it.</p><p>&gt; You know, I even *forgot* about us having 10 fingers....<br/>&gt; of course, perhaps we could have developed with a base 20<br/>&gt; system, as well, if we had used our toes?? ...</p><p>In fact, there are cultures around the world which *do* use<br/>base-20 number systems.</p><p>There are even remnants of it in European languages, as in<br/>the English use of &quot;score&quot; to mean &quot;20&quot; (cf. Lincoln&apos;s<br/>_Gettysburg Address_: &quot;Four score and seven years ago...&quot;<br/>to mean 87 years, which is a direct reflection of French,<br/>where 80 is &quot;quatre vignts&quot;, or &quot;four 20s&quot;).  These usages<br/>are the result of employing the toes as well as the fingers.</p><p>Conversely, some counting systems are base-5, using each hand<br/>and foot as a separate system.  In fact, that&apos;s probably where<br/>the idea of the abacus originated.</p><p>(I&apos;ve figured out a base-6 system where the fingers of one<br/>hand each represent 6^0 [= 1, as in regular counting], the<br/>fingers of the other hand 6^1, the toes of one foot 6^2, and<br/>the toes of the other foot 6^3, which, if one could learn how<br/>to use it, would make the fingers/toes system an accurate<br/>digital computer able to calculate any number up to 1295!</p><p>Perhaps this is the origin of the substantial historical<br/>use of 12 in counting: 12 units in a dozen, 12 inches in a<br/>foot, etc.</p><p>I realize it seems odd to count in such a way, but people get<br/>used to this kind of thing thru constant use.

That&apos;s precisely how Schoenberg<br/>&gt; thought of it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks so much, Monz, for this interesting historical observation,<br/>and explanation of the way Schoenberg viewed the pitch continuum with<br/>12-EDO!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I&apos;ve figured out a base-6 system where the fingers of one<br/>&gt; hand each represent 6^0 [= 1, as in regular counting], the<br/>&gt; fingers of the other hand 6^1, the toes of one foot 6^2, and<br/>&gt; the toes of the other foot 6^3, which, if one could learn how<br/>&gt; to use it, would make the fingers/toes system an accurate<br/>&gt; digital computer able to calculate any number up to 1295!<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is quite excellent, Monz... but how do you sit when you do<br/>this...
