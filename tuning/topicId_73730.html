I happen to like real players in<br/>real rooms, and I prefer my own music to be made that way; other<br/>musicians have other preferences which I respect, but I&apos;d hope that they<br/>respect mine as well.&quot;</p><p>After many years of composing music on tape with synthesizers, and<br/>recently on hard drive with software, I&apos;m now quite insistent that my<br/>music be written only for acoustic instruments and their microtonal<br/>possibilities (even as I&apos;m temporarily forced to continue using the<br/>software).</p><p>There&apos;s an actual human need for organic things with perceptible<br/>imperfections, such as prefering polished wood furniture over<br/>metal/plastic constructions covered with imitation wood veneer. This<br/>applies to sound as well; slick studio products eventually bore the ear,<br/>and torture the soul.</p><p>Microtonal music could easily become associated with prettified<br/>electronic audio-&quot;philes&quot; and tuned wine glasses with pots-and-pans,<br/>unless it is repeatedly heard in performance with warm-sounding acoustic<br/>instruments instead. I&apos;ve recently taken up the violin and recorder<br/>again with the intention of composing for them in alternate tunings, and<br/>my sweetheart just surprised me by ordering an Egyptian &apos;ud for my<br/>birthday. Brace yourselves.</p></div><h3><a id=73734 href="#73734">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/4/2007 1:29:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>Thanks for the acoustic support.  My first marriage certainly proves I  don&apos;t<br/>discriminate against synthesized sound (as true per the PITCH Electronical<br/>album), but my heart is definitely in the warmth that seems to uniquely emanate<br/> from the non-electric world.
