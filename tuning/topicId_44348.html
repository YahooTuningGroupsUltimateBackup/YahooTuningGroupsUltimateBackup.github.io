It should come out in a finalized form with the new CD<br/>by Michael Thorne, made in his studio.</p><p>The book will explain how the piece was put together, faithfully to Ives&apos;s<br/>detailed directions.  This is contrary to the received wisdom up until now,<br/>partially explaining the difficulty in finding a publisher (though the responses<br/>have all been universally good).</p><p>If anyone would like an advance copy, it can be sent by e-mail (or hard<br/>cover).  Due to the extreme financial situation now being experienced, I will ask<br/>for $20 for an e-mail copy.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
