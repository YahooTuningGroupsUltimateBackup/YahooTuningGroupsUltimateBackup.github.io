For good temperaments with a strict cutoff it probably approaches linear time. The worst case is exponential.<br/>I don&apos;t thing there&apos;s a general linear time algorithm. It&apos;s possible for the optimal mapping to change when you consider a new prime so you have to back track. What you can do is find each new prime according to the optimal octave stretch for the ones you already have. For classic TOP that will give an optimal mapping once you get beyond the point where half a step is good enough. It also gives you a good cutoff to use with the strict algorithm.</p><p>        Graham</p><p>------Original message------<br/>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Date: Wednesday, December 21, 2011 5:04:41 AM GMT-0500<br/>Subject: [tuning] Another way to get to infinite limit temperaments</p><p>An idea I just had:</p><p>1) start with a mapping matrix of dimension RxC in which R &lt;= C.</p><p>[5 8]<br/>[7 11]</p><p>2) add the next prime by just selecting the coefficients that generate<br/>the temperament lowest in ________ badness</p><p>2.3:<br/>[5 8 12]<br/>[7 11 16]</p><p>3) goto 2</p><p>As you can see, this will go on forever.

That leads to an optimal octave stretch and step size.  You can then find the nearest match to 7:4 as a multiple of that step size. The result is more likely to be optimal than keeping on taking the nearest approximations to equal divisions of the 2:1</p><p>        Graham</p><p>------Original message------<br/>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Date: Thursday, December 22, 2011 10:17:24 AM GMT-0500<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Another way to get to infinite limit temperaments</p><p>On Wed, Dec 21, 2011 at 5:17 PM, gbreed@... &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t thing there&apos;s a general linear time algorithm.
