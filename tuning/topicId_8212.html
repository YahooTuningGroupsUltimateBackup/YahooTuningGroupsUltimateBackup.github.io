Tests have shown that these<br/>categorical intervals are bounded at around 50&#xFFFD; above and below the 12-tET<br/>intervals, except for the unison-semitone boundary, which is about 25&#xFFFD; above<br/>and below the unison. In other words, the fact that you heard John&apos;s chord<br/>out of context means that your ear/brain most likely perceived the 435&#xFFFD;<br/>interval as falling into the &quot;major third&quot; category; meanwhile, Joe Monzo&apos;s<br/>example started with the 386&#xFFFD; interval, which you heard as a major third;<br/>then the upper voice of the major third ascended by small intervals, ending<br/>up 49&#xFFFD; higher -- enough higher so that, categorically speaking, it sounded<br/>like it had climbed a semitone -- hence the &quot;fourth&quot; perception.</p><p>Joe says he&apos;s created a MIDI file where a sus chord &quot;resolves&quot; down to a<br/>14:18:21 -- maybe he can e-mail it to a few of us -- I&apos;m willing to bet that<br/>in this context, you&apos;ll hear the latter chord as a definite (but dissonant)<br/>major chord, though it&apos;s exactly the same chord you heard at the end of<br/>Joe&apos;s other MIDI file. It&apos;s much like the situation where, with two<br/>identical regions of exactly the same color, one surrounded by white and the<br/>other surrounded by black, the first appears much darker than the second.</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2000 5:38:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To my naive post:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Play with it.
