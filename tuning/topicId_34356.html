See the VRML models I gave a link<br/>to in about the previous post to this group.</p><p>I&apos;ve also done some 3d images in VRML using tree shapes and am planning eventually<br/>to have a go at adding music to them in some way or another - these are<br/>natural looking forms, but one could map them to musical structures<br/>and so make music from them (possibly, if the programming worked out).<br/>I have the idea of music that ripples up / down / around the leaves of the<br/>trees etc, with the model lighting up as the particular leaves or twigs<br/>sound their notes. But, whether it can actually be done in VRML, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=34367 href="#34367">ðŸ”—</a>L.Grohn &#x3C;lauri.grohn@skynet.be&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2002 2:02:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes, I&apos;d be interested to hear more about how you are doing it too.</p><p>I will publish the a description of my methods on Wednesday 20.02.2002<br/>in my Gallery pages.
