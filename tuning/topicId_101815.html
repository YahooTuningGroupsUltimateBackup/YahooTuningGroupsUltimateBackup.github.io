We get reasonable approximations of<br/>14:13, 13:12, and 12:11, with the latter two most common.<br/>The fifths at 703.1 or 704.3 cents are impure, on the<br/>average, by about 1.72 cents in this 17-note temperament.<br/>One septimal form supported is 12:13:14:16.</p><p>The second system is simply a chain of 24 notes in fifths<br/>at an even 705 cents, with neutral steps at 135 and 150<br/>cents, and neutral thirds at 345 and 360 cents. The 15-cent<br/>comma steps are useful in providing a choice at certain<br/>locations of either smaller or larger neutral intervals,<br/>or of either regular or septimal forms of major or minor<br/>intervals. Curiously, regular minor sevenths are equal<br/>precisely to the 990 cents mentioned in one of your posts!<br/>This tuning shows how a basic rank-2 system can produce an<br/>abundance of unequal neutral intervals.</p><p>My post also proposes that just as a Near Eastern musician<br/>surveying the last millennium or so of European composition<br/>might seek out a number of different &quot;Europic&quot; tunings to<br/>reflect the diverse approaches over these many centuries,<br/>so the Maqam tradition going back a millennium and more<br/>might inspire a range of regular or near-regular systems<br/>as well as more irregular ones, each seeking to highlight<br/>and explore some aspects of recorded fixed-pitch tunings<br/>as well as emulate some fine points of flexible-pitch<br/>performance.</p><p>I hope this is a useful &quot;Abstract&quot; of my next post, and<br/>thank you again for inviting me to participate in this<br/>ongoing discussion.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2011 10:52:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Mike Battaglia and all!</p><p>Please let me try to respond, however belatedly, to your post of<br/>September 3 on &quot;Maqamic temperament&quot; which I just read last<br/>night. Apart from raising a few general philosophical questions,<br/>I&apos;d like to offer one 17-note tuning based on a possibility you<br/>mention: two unequal neutral third generators plus a 2/1 octave.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Philosophical questions: The Maqam/Dastgah &quot;Solar System&quot;<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As I understand it, the Regular Mapping Paradigm was designed in<br/>good part as a tool for discovering and classifying tuning<br/>systems previously unknown or not fully recognized. I am tempted<br/>to compare it to a spaceship surveying the galaxy in order to<br/>identify and gather some basic information on planetary systems.</p><p>With the millennium-old tradition of Maqam music, and its Persian<br/>offshoot of Dastgah music, we have arrived at a planet, or rather<br/>an extensive solar system, inhabited by a very advanced<br/>civilization indeed, from which those of us who are newcomers can<br/>learn much. Here &quot;microtonality&quot; is not a minority movement but<br/>an integral aspect of theory and performance art.</p><p>Let us consider the question from a different perspective: how<br/>would we, as musicians coming from a Near Eastern or other<br/>tradition, design a &quot;Europic&quot; tuning intended to sum up the last<br/>millennium or so of European composition?</p><p>One quick answer is that we would likely design more than one<br/>kind of &quot;Europic&quot; tuning: the historical patterns of medieval<br/>Pythagorean intonation, Renaissance meantone, irregular 12-note<br/>circulating schemes of the 18th-19th centuries, and 12-ED2 all<br/>call for recognition and exploration.</p><p>The incomplete and evocative rather than definitive nature of<br/>even the most complex and subtle fixed-pitch system need not<br/>deter us from making the most of the recorded historical details<br/>that have come down to us. For example, I would guess that a<br/>colorful 19-note meantone temperament might nicely illustrate the<br/>contrasts of chromatic keyboard music around 1600, giving us a<br/>good basis to consider possible refinements of vocal or other<br/>flexible-pitch performances in this era (e.g. adaptive JI).</p><p>With the rich literature of Near Eastern fixed-pitch tunings<br/>going back to al-Farabi (870-950), we likewise have a good<br/>foundation for adopting, modifying, or designing systems which<br/>embrace such characteristic traits as more or less subtly unequal<br/>neutral steps and intervals, septimal shadings, and with larger<br/>systems also steps at a comma apart to permit a crude emulation<br/>of flexible-pitch fluidity.</p><p>In my view, an &quot;alternative tuning&quot; approach to Maqam/Dastgah<br/>music may seek to realize characteristic traits in new ways, for<br/>example by regular or near-regular systems where the fifths are<br/>tempered in the wide direction.</p><p>There is a good argument that especially for smaller systems, an<br/>unabashedly irregular temperament may be the best choice: Persian<br/>tar tunings in 17 notes, for example, fit this model, as well as<br/>the yet more parsimonious tunings for the santur, typically with<br/>about 10 pitch classes tailored to a given dastgah or modal<br/>family (not all found in the same octave).</p><p>The rank-3 tuning I present here may err on the side of regularity;<br/>others are possible, as I discuss, which are yet more simple and<br/>regular (rank-2) while still covering some of the intonational<br/>bases which you mention in your thoughtful post.</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>2. A 17-Note Matrix (with thanks to Erv Wilson!)<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>What are some general goals for a relatively simple and<br/>attractive Maqam and/or Dastgah tuning system, say in 17 notes<br/>per octave? Here are a few:</p><p>       (1) We want fifths either at or quite close to a pure 3/2,<br/>           with rather less impurity than in 12n-ED2 (1.96 cents)<br/>           as one guide to what is &quot;quite close.&quot; I thank Jacques<br/>           Dudon for really impressing this point upon me, which<br/>           has altered a bit how I usually tune.</p><p>       (2) We want a variety of Zalzalian or neutral sizes, at<br/>           least two and ideally more. With only 17 notes and a<br/>           regular or near-regular tuning, we&apos;re likely to get<br/>           mainly two sizes, e.g. two unequal neutral third<br/>           generators which add up to a 3/2 or something close.</p><p>       (3) We&apos;d like some septimal or near-septimal intervals:<br/>           steps near 7:6 are very stylish for Hijaz or Persian<br/>           Chahargah, while a 12:13:14:16 division is very<br/>           pleasing for a low variety of Persian Shur or Turkish<br/>           Ushshaq. With only 17 notes, and fifths quite close to<br/>           3/2, we may not get a large number of these septimal<br/>           intervals -- also including 9:7, featured by al-Farabi<br/>           and Safi al-Din al-Urmawi -- but a few, strategically<br/>           placed, are very welcome!</p><p>As I&apos;ll show in the next section, we can meet (2) and (3) with a<br/>rank-2 system where the regular minor seventh is precisely the<br/>size you mentioned in one of your posts: 990 cents. However,<br/>let&apos;s start by considering a rank-3 system which meets all three<br/>of these goals.</p><p>Following one of the rank-3 techniques you suggest, we choose as<br/>our generators the 2/1 octave plus two unequal neutral thirds, or<br/>here actually two neutral third generators one of which is<br/>constant (357.4 cents) and one slightly irregular (345.7 or 346.9<br/>cents). The variability of the smaller generator is a quirk of<br/>my 1024-ED2 synthesizer, and results in fifths at 703.1 or 704.3<br/>cents -- a small difference, but one meaning that some fifths are<br/>twice as impure as others!</p><p>The larger neutral third at 357.4 cents is almost identical to<br/>59/48 (357.2 cents), a ratio arising in Safi al-Din&apos;s &grave;oud tuning<br/>based on a division of 32/27 into 64:59:54 (yes, 59-limit in the<br/>13th century!). For the smaller neutral third, 345.7 cents is<br/>quite close to the 72/59 (344.7 cents) found in this same<br/>division (72:64:59:54), while 346.9 cents is close to 11/9 (347.4<br/>cents).</p><p>Here&apos;s our 17-note system:</p><p>! met24-wilson_rast-bayyati17_Dup.scl<br/>!<br/>Tempering of Wilson&apos;s Rast-Bayyati Matrix (17)<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 82.03125<br/> 150.00000<br/> 207.42188<br/> 289.45313<br/> 357.42188<br/> 439.45313<br/> 496.87500<br/> 564.84375<br/> 646.87500<br/> 704.29688<br/> 785.15625<br/> 854.29688<br/> 911.71875<br/> 992.57813<br/> 1061.71875<br/> 1142.57812<br/> 2/1</p><p>This is basically a tempering of Erv Wilson&apos;s original<br/>Rast-Bayyati matrix &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF</a>&gt;, which uses<br/>al-Farabi&apos;s just thirds at 27/22 and 11/9 to build the matrix.</p><p>Why temper? While it certainly isn&apos;t required, one advantage is<br/>that we get a few locations with steps near 14:13 (128.3 cents),<br/>actually a bit narrower at 125.4 or 126.6 cents. This makes<br/>possible some 12:13:14:16 divisions, as at Scala steps 9 and 16.<br/>The average impurity of the fifths is about 1.72 cents, a<br/>delicate balance between tempering lightly and getting 14:13<br/>consistently within 3 cents of just.</p><p>The position I&apos;ve chosen for the 1/1 might be one good place to<br/>start exploring, because we have the premier Arab (and Turkish)<br/>maqam: Maqam Rast, with support for both the conjunct and<br/>disjunct form, the first standard in the 10th-14th century era<br/>and the second often considered &quot;fundamental&quot; in modern theory.</p><p>             Rast                      Rast<br/>   |-----------------------|------------------------|<br/>   0    207.4   357.4   496.9   704.3    854.3   992.6   2/1</p><p>                                704.3     911.7  1061.7  2/1<br/>                                  |-----------------------|<br/>                                             Rast</p><p>Here both the sixth degree (neutral or major) and the seventh<br/>(minor or neutral) are negotiable. We have a subtle contrast<br/>between larger neutral second steps (150.0 cents) and smaller<br/>ones (138.3 or 139.5 cents), the larger characteristically<br/>preceding the smaller in an Arab or Turkish Rast.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at the 12:13:14:16 division, available as mentioned<br/>above on Scala step 16:</p><p>                                         842.6<br/>   0    139.5   264.8   496.9   704.3   761.7   969.1   2/1<br/>                               622.3</p><p>This shading of a Persian Shur has seven &quot;textbook&quot; steps, which<br/>we might analyze as a lower Shur tetrachord (139.5-125.4-232.0<br/>cents) of ~12:13:14:16, a tone, and an upper tetrachord at the<br/>fifth of 57.4-207.4-230.9 cents, or a tempered 28:27-9:8-8:7.<br/>However, when descending and for certain gushe-s or modal themes,<br/>the fifth is often lowered, here to 622.3 cents. Sometimes the<br/>sixth degree is neutral rather than minor, with 842.6 cents quite<br/>close to 13/8, and almost identical to 96/59. While the minor<br/>sixth above the final or note of repose is most common, a neutral<br/>third below the final (here by 357.4 cents) is standard!</p><p>In addition to regular intervals (e.g. 288.3 or 289.5 cents near<br/>13/11, and 992.6 cents near 39/22 or 16/9), and the septimal ones<br/>we have just used for this shading of Shur, there are some<br/>&quot;supraseptimal ones&quot; at 275.4 or 276.6 and 979.7 cents, for<br/>example. Such shadings may occur rather often in Persian and<br/>Turkish music, and add to the general variety.</p><p>So far, in these Maqam and Dastgah scales, we&apos;ve seen two types<br/>of tetrachords or pentachords:</p><p>       (1) &quot;Zalzalian diatonic&quot; forms with a tone (9:8 or<br/>           sometimes 8:7) plus two neutral seconds of one type or<br/>           another.</p><p>       (2) Diatonic forms with tones or semitones only<br/>           (e.g. 57.4-207.4-230.9 cents for the upper tetrachord<br/>           of our septimal Shur taken from the fifth degree, one<br/>           permutation of the Diatonic of Archytas with 28:27,<br/>           8:7, and 9:8).</p><p>A third possibility may be called chromatic, or as John Chalmers<br/>has said &quot;neo-chromatic,&quot; in a Greek sense: the Hijaz type, where<br/>the middle interval is often some kind of &quot;augmented second&quot; or<br/>&quot;small minor third,&quot; with 7:6 or so an attractive size. One maqam<br/>mixing the Zalzalian and Hijaz types is Maqam Suznak, which we<br/>can think of as a lower Rast tetrachord plus tone, or pentachord,<br/>plus an upper Hijaz, here available on Scala step 4 (289.5 cents):</p><p>                 Rast                            Hijaz<br/>     |--------------------------|       |----------------------|<br/>     0     207.4    357.4    495.7    703.1   853.1   1118.0  2/1</p><p>The Hijaz is quite close to Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi&apos;s<br/>1/1-12/11-14/11-4/3 as described around 1300, a permutation of<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Chromatic (1/1-22/21-8/7-4/3). We can also use<br/>another version of Suznak at this location where the upper Hijaz<br/>tetrachord (rather similar to Beyhom&apos;s type called Zirkula) has<br/>the small interval or semitone first, then the large middle<br/>interval, with a neutral second as the upper step.</p><p>                 Rast                        Hijaz (Zirkula)<br/>     |--------------------------|       |----------------------|<br/>     0     207.4    357.4    495.7    703.1  772,3   1060.5   2/1</p><p>These two forms of Suznak might routinely occur as modulations<br/>from Rast. The first form ties in nicely with a conjunct Rast,<br/>with only the seventh degree altered from minor to major. The<br/>second form with Beyhom&apos;s Zirkula variety of Hijaz, more or less,<br/>is identical to a disjunct Rast apart from the minor rather than<br/>major sixth step. Another difference is that while the large<br/>middle interval of the first form of Hijaz is 264.8 cents, a near<br/>7:6, the second or Zirkula-like form has a regular 288.3-cent<br/>third, close to 13:11. Beyhom&apos;s typical Zirkula would prefer a<br/>smaller or &quot;lightly augmented&quot; middle step, say around 7:6.</p><p>Our 17-note tuning also includes a tempering of Jacques Dudon&apos;s<br/>beautiful differentially coherent (-c) mode called Ibina,<br/>sometimes known around the 14th century as Nahaft, here given as<br/>found on Scala step 2 (150.0 cents):</p><p>            72     78     88     96    108   117    128     144<br/>             0   138.6  347.4  498.0  702.0 840.5  996.1   1200<br/>Dudon JI:   1/1  13/12   11/9   4/3    3/2   13/8   16/9    2/1</p><p>                   Mohajira                   Bayyati<br/>             |--------------------|     |--------------------|<br/>             0   139.5  346.9  496.9  704.3 842.6  992.6   1200<br/>                                  |------------------|<br/>                                         Mustaqim</p><p>This mode offers three tetrachords which might be called Mohajira<br/>after Dudon&apos;s modal type and quest (here 139.5-207.4-150.0<br/>cents), Mustaqim as named by Ibn Sina at 9:8-13:12-128:117 (here<br/>207.4-138.3-150.0 cents), and Bayyati (138.3-150.0-207.4 cents).<br/>In each, the smaller neutral second precedes the larger -- a fine<br/>contrast with Rast, where the larger neutral step comes first.</p><p>In sum, this 17-note tuning, while somewhat different than a<br/>typical Persian tuning for tar or setar, offers at least a<br/>taste of the variety sought in this and other Near Eastern<br/>traditions. It is one possible starting point for an exploration<br/>of regular or slightly irregular rank-3 systems.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. A Note on Rank-2 Systems With Unequal Neutral Intervals<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>If one is willing to temper fifths and fourths rather more than<br/>in the above example -- where the average degree of temperament,<br/>I should note, is just a tad greater than that of George Secor&apos;s<br/>29-HTT and related tunings -- then it is quite possible to design<br/>a rank-2 system with unequal neutral intervals and some close<br/>septimal approximations.</p><p>Here I would like to focus on one 24-note system which, although<br/>it requires tempering fifths and fourths by a full 3 cents and<br/>involves some other compromises, also has some special advantages<br/>which I might welcome in my more complicated rank-3 tunings, and<br/>I suspect Jacques might appreciate also, at least as an<br/>intriguing diversion from more precise systems.</p><p>This system is engagingly simple, and hopefully also simply<br/>engaging: a chain of 24 notes in fifths at an even 705 cents!<br/>This rank-2 temperament could also be thought of as a subset of a<br/>rank-1 temperament, 80-ED2.</p><p>! reg705_24.scl<br/>!<br/>Regular 705-cent temperament, 24 of 80-tET<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 60.00000<br/> 135.00000<br/> 195.00000<br/> 210.00000<br/> 270.00000<br/> 285.00000<br/> 345.00000<br/> 420.00000<br/> 480.00000<br/> 495.00000<br/> 555.00000<br/> 630.00000<br/> 690.00000<br/> 705.00000<br/> 765.00000<br/> 840.00000<br/> 900.00000<br/> 915.00000<br/> 975.00000<br/> 990.00000<br/> 1050.00000<br/> 1125.00000<br/> 1185.00000<br/> 2/1</p><p>The neutral intervals at 345 and 840 cents closely approximate<br/>11/9 and 13/8, with the latter virtually just; the 15-cent<br/>difference between neutral seconds (135/150 cents) and thirds<br/>(345/360 cents) offers what might be termed a &quot;medium&quot; degree of<br/>contrast, rather more than half a comma but less than a full<br/>comma.</p><p>One compromise is that while 435 cents is a virtually just 9/7,<br/>7/6 is a bit more than 3 cents wide at 270 cents, and 7/4 much<br/>more so at 975 cents -- still, however, a recognizably &quot;septimal&quot;<br/>seventh.</p><p>Another compromise that goes with the rank-2 structure is that<br/>the 12:13:14:16 tetrachord is realized with two identical smaller<br/>neutral seconds, 135-135-225 cents. While one might ideally<br/>prefer some contrast between these two steps, and also the<br/>melodic touch of the narrower 14:13 step, some divisions with<br/>equal or near-equal steps (e.g. 135-225-135 cents in one example<br/>of Hormoz Farhat) do occur in Near Eastern practice.</p><p>The 15-cent comma steps permit a choice from the 1/1 of this<br/>Scala tuning, for example, of a minor third at 270 or 285 cents<br/>(near 7/6 or 33/28), and likewise of a minor seventh at 975 or<br/>990 cents. This flexibly can be useful in Persian Shur, for<br/>example.</p><p>Additionally, they permit a neat solution to a problem which<br/>Jacques Dudon has discussed in this group: the perennial quest to<br/>have the right steps for an Arab Rast at a given location, and a<br/>Bayyati on the step a 9:8 above.</p><p>To see how this situation is neatly addressed, let&apos;s place our<br/>Rast on Scala step 3 (135 cents), and look at a relevant subset<br/>of steps for Rast and Bayyati:</p><p>Rast (disjunct)  0   210  360  495  705   915     1065  2/1<br/>Rast (conjunct)  0   210  360  495  705  855  990       2/1</p><p>Bayyati         (0)  210  345  495  705   915 990 1065  2/1  1410<br/>                      0   135  285  495   705 780  855  990   2/1</p><p>Rast has a tetrachord of 210-150-135 cents (larger neutral step<br/>first), while a stylish Bayyati on its 9/8 step calls for<br/>135-150-210 cents with the _smaller_ neutral step first! Having<br/>steps above the 1/1 of Rast at both 345 and 360 cents neatly lets<br/>us optimize the tuning of both Rast and Bayyati. We can also<br/>follow the understanding of many traditional Egyptian performers<br/>as reported by Scott Marcus that while the lower tetrachord of<br/>Bayyati has a small neutral step (135 cents) first, a neutral<br/>sixth degree when it is used tends to be on the high side (here<br/>855 cents).</p><p>While the standard or &quot;untransposed&quot; position for Bayyati is on<br/>the 9/8 step of Rast (e.g. C Rast and D Bayyati in usual Arab<br/>notation), in a classic Arab style of the kind studied by Scott<br/>Marcus one does not modulate directly from Rast to a Bayyati on<br/>this step. Rather, a standard modulation is from Rast to a<br/>Bayyati a fifth higher, here also happily possible with the<br/>desired intonation for each maqam:</p><p>  Rast (combined conjunct/disjunct):<br/>  O   210  360  495  705  855 915 990 1065 2/1</p><p>  Bayyati (with alternative minor or neutral sixth degrees):<br/>                     705 840      990      2/1  1410 1485 1560...<br/>                      0  135      285      495   705  780  855...</p><p>Since Marcus suggests that the lower (and smaller) neutral step<br/>of Bayyati in an Egyptian tradition might tend to the range of<br/>around 135-145 cents, 705 cents is just enough temperament to get<br/>a 135-cent step as the chromatic semitone or apotome from seven<br/>fifths up.</p><p>Both the usefulness of the 15-cent steps (17-commas) for<br/>obtaining a greater choice of neutral intervals, and the desire<br/>for more septimal intervals, amply motivate a larger 24-note<br/>system.</p><p>-------------<br/>4. Conclusion<br/>-------------</p><p>Maqam and Dastgah traditions have a fluidity which fully emerges<br/>in flexible-pitch performances; for the last millennium and more,<br/>fixed-pitch tunings have sought to emulate some features of this<br/>rich reality.</p><p>Goals such as pure or near-pure fifths and fourths, a variety of<br/>neutral steps and intervals, and inclusion of septimal colors may<br/>lead to a great variety of tuning systems for this music. I have<br/>here tried to focus on &quot;medium-size&quot; systems of 17 or 24 notes to<br/>suggest some of these aspects of the question.</p><p>At least from the perspective of some modern traditions and<br/>practices, these systems might be regarded as somewhat<br/>&quot;xenharmonic,&quot; with the small steps at 57 or 60 cents, and<br/>possibly the regular semitones at a rather narrow 75 cents in the<br/>705-cent temperament, standing out somewhat from the norm. Also,<br/>other types of systems might reckon with the 81:80 or other<br/>aspects here left unaddressed.</p><p>In short, this is a question with many aspects. Thank you for<br/>your post and invitation to explore it with you and others!</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2011 12:36:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo, and thanks for your thoughtful reply. I read the whole<br/>post, and I have a few comments on it. Sorry for the lack of response<br/>on my end, moving + work has meant that I have a lot less time for<br/>music theory than I&apos;d like these past few weeks.</p><p>Firstly, I should note that what you&apos;re doing here and what I was<br/>doing with maqamic temperament are not the same thing.</p><p>My executive summary of what&apos;s gone on is as follows:<br/>- Much of the attention of maqam music on this list since I&apos;ve join<br/>has been focused on finding a fixed-pitch tuning that can handle all<br/>of the expressive nuances of maqam intonation.<br/>- Maqam intonation varies from region to region, different &quot;dialects&quot; exist.<br/>- Maqam intonation is an important part of the enjoyment of maqam<br/>music; it carries a lot of musical information.</p><p>I took a different approach: I ignored all of that. I didn&apos;t ignore it<br/>because I don&apos;t think it exists, or because I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s<br/>important, but just because I was trying to do something a little<br/>higher level. There are two arguments for why I called the temperament<br/>I did &quot;maqamic,&quot; which I&apos;ll call the &quot;strong&quot; and the &quot;weak&quot;<br/>arguments. I think that even the &quot;weak&quot; argument is enough, so I&apos;ll<br/>start with that.</p><p>=WEAK ARGUMENT=</p><p>Even minus all of the stuff I mentioned offlist about deliberately<br/>adaptive temperaments and equivalence classes, I just wanted to some<br/>up with a regular temperament that was &quot;like&quot; maqam music. I wanted it<br/>to be a shameless mimicry, a dumbing down of sorts just to fit it in<br/>the regular temperament paradigm, and that was it. It&apos;s not supposed<br/>to be a substitute for actual maqam music, it&apos;s just a &quot;maqamic&quot;<br/>temperament. I did this because a precedent for this sort of naming<br/>system exists: we have &quot;pelogic&quot; and &quot;slendric&quot; temperaments, which<br/>are openly disclosed to only be mimicries of their original gamelan<br/>counterparts. The &quot;ic&quot; suffix has come to take on this meaning, a<br/>precedent dating back to 2002 or so:</p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/3334?var=1">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/3334?var=1</a></p><p>So consider this an admission that regular temperament theory so far<br/>fails to handle complex, naturally-occuring irregular tunings. It&apos;s<br/>the &quot;regular mapping paradigm.&quot; To truly appreciate the glory of<br/>complex ethnological tunings, we&apos;ll need to develop an &quot;irregular<br/>mapping paradigm.&quot; As it stands, Werckmeister and 12-equal are the<br/>same thing in the regular mapping paradigm, which is &lt;12 19 28|. We<br/>kind of just leave it there and let you tune things however you want.</p><p>Comparatively speaking, I believe that I put more effort in hashing<br/>maqamic out than I believe was done for some of these other<br/>ethnological mimicries, like &quot;slendric,&quot; for example. Keenan Pepper&apos;s<br/>mentioned that slendro scales in real gamelans are tuned closer to<br/>something like a quasi-equal version of Father[5]. He also did some<br/>measurements of pelog for one of the gamelan instruments that he owns,<br/>and it wasn&apos;t very close to mavila[7] at all. But all right - it&apos;s not<br/>actually slendro, just &quot;slendric temperament,&quot; and it&apos;s not actually<br/>pelog, just &quot;pelogic.&quot;</p><p>In my case, I analyzed some Bashir recordings with a spectrogram to<br/>see that he&apos;d sometimes turn the minor seventh into 7/4, I noted that<br/>the major thirds were often close to 5/4, I worked out that all of the<br/>maqamat can be viewed as irregularly-tuned MODMOS&apos;s of the 3L4s<br/>MODMOS, so I put the pieces together and called it &quot;maqamic.&quot; I saw<br/>that it was common for the neutral thirds to be somewhere around 11/9,<br/>so that brought me into the 11-limit. I saw that sometimes people<br/>wanted the neutral thirds to be closer to 16/13, so that gave me a<br/>13-limit extension. So the emphasis from my part was never on<br/>intonational expression, because I just wanted to analyze the cursory,<br/>high-level foundation of maqam music, and throw it into a temperament.<br/>And likewise, if someone wants to complain that the neutral thirds<br/>don&apos;t have much to actually do with 11/9 in maqam music, that&apos;s fine -<br/>but they do in maqamic temperament.</p><p>In short, I&apos;m not going to claim that you can just load up a<br/>fixed-pitch instrument, tune it to the 36/35, 81/80, and 121/120<br/>linear temperament, and that that&apos;ll be flawless for maqam music. So<br/>since I&apos;m not making that claim, I do think that there is a purpose<br/>that it can serve, which shouldn&apos;t interfere with anything else.</p><p>=STRONG ARGUMENT=</p><p>Regular temperament theory deals in terms of very abstract<br/>homomorphisms between different lattices/Z-modules/free abelian<br/>groups. It does so in a way that doesn&apos;t have anything to do with<br/>specific tunings or intonations at all, not until you want to<br/>calculate tuning error, anyway.</p><p>For example, 12-equal and Werckmeister are both &quot;the same temperament&quot;<br/>in the regular mapping paradigm; they&apos;re both represented by the val<br/>&lt;12 19 28|, and 81/80 and 128/125 vanish in both tunings. Also,<br/>1/4-comma meantone and 1/3-comma meantone are the same thing, they&apos;re<br/>both represented by the vanishing unison vector |-4 4 -1&gt; and all that<br/>that entails. We obviously don&apos;t think that they -ARE- the same, it&apos;s<br/>just that (as far as I know) nobody has spent much time hashing out<br/>the problem of irregular or circulating temperaments. And it&apos;s<br/>-REALLY- true that nobody has spent time hashing out the problem of<br/>tuning systems for deliberately adaptive instruments like the oud. But<br/>we do have the homomorphism piece of the puzzle together, so we can at<br/>least start there.</p><p>There&apos;s a zillion different types of neutral third, so obviously a<br/>one-size-fits all regime for the neutral third will suck some of the<br/>life out of maqam music. But, mathematically, it&apos;s not a crime to look<br/>at all of these differently and expressively intoned neutral thirds as<br/>being adaptively retuned versions of &quot;the same thing,&quot; which is &quot;a<br/>neutral third.&quot; And isn&apos;t the scalar structure of maqam music based<br/>around that concept anyway? For example, when someone plays a neutral<br/>third tuned sharper in one context, and tuned flatter in another, does<br/>the performer really think those are two fundamentally different scale<br/>degrees? Or just expressively retuned versions of the same thing? I&apos;m<br/>no expert, but given all of the notation I&apos;ve seen, I think the<br/>latter.</p><p>So why not, couldn&apos;t all of these expressive regional maqam<br/>intonational variants just be viewed as dynamically-retuned<br/>circulating versions of the MODMOS&apos;s of 3L4s, which is made up of a<br/>chain of neutral thirds? Just because we have no way to store and<br/>categorize how, specifically they&apos;re dynamically retuned doesn&apos;t mean<br/>that it&apos;s useless information - far from it. But why not just analyze<br/>things as that the chain of neutral thirds is a fundamental concept to<br/>maqam music (being as all of the maqamat line up neatly as MODMOS&apos;s of<br/>them!), and then explore a second, deeper layer of how those thirds<br/>are intoned, but still compatible on the high level with the |&lt;1 1 0<br/>...|, &lt;0 2 8 ...|&gt; structure?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2011 12:00:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Comparatively speaking, I believe that I put more effort in hashing<br/>&gt; maqamic out than I believe was done for some of these other<br/>&gt; ethnological mimicries, like &quot;slendric,&quot; for example.

Dialogues like this<br/>can be an opportunity for what George Secor has called<br/>&quot;cross-pollination&quot; and learning all around.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to follow your good example by seeking to be reasonably<br/>concise (for once!).</p><p>&gt;   Firstly, I should note that what you&apos;re doing here and what I<br/>&gt;   was doing with maqamic temperament are not the same thing.</p><p>This certainly seems true; and one approach, of course, doesn&apos;t<br/>exclude another.</p><p>&gt;  My executive summary of what&apos;s gone on is as follows:<br/>&gt;  - Much of the attention of maqam music on this list since I&apos;ve join<br/>&gt;  has been focused on finding a fixed-pitch tuning that can handle all<br/>&gt;  of the expressive nuances of maqam intonation.</p><p>Or, the more modest among those of us on this quest might say,<br/>&quot;many of the expressive nuances of maqam intonation.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  - Maqam intonation varies from region to region, different &quot;dialects&quot; exist.</p><p>Absolutely true!</p><p>&gt;  - Maqam intonation is an important part of the enjoyment of maqam<br/>&gt;  music; it carries a lot of musical information.</p><p>Again, we&apos;re much in agreement.</p><p>And I&apos;d add that your measurements and analysis of the performances by<br/>Munir Bashir really merit a thread in their own right! I&apos;d love to<br/>participate in this.</p><p>&gt;  I took a different approach: I ignored all of that. I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt;  ignore it because I don&apos;t think it exists, or because I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;  believe it&apos;s important, but just because I was trying to do<br/>&gt;  something a little higher level. There are two arguments for<br/>&gt;  why I called the temperament I did &quot;maqamic,&quot; which I&apos;ll call<br/>&gt;  the &quot;strong&quot; and the &quot;weak&quot; arguments. I think that even the<br/>&gt;  &quot;weak&quot; argument is enough, so I&apos;ll start with that.</p><p>A curious point here is that one person might strive toward a &quot;higher<br/>level&quot; of generality or abstraction, and another for a &quot;higher level&quot;<br/>of resolution or detail -- for example, in developing and applying a<br/>regular temperament theory of a given kind.</p><p>To keep this brief for now, I&apos;m responding only on a few points that<br/>might help clarify both your eloquently stated &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;<br/>arguments, and the kind of regular temperament theory I tend to<br/>follow. And I&apos;d add that your whole post merits a careful reading.</p><p>&gt; =WEAK ARGUMENT=<br/>&gt;  Even minus all of the stuff I mentioned offlist about deliberately<br/>&gt;  adaptive temperaments and equivalence classes, I just wanted to some<br/>&gt;  up with a regular temperament that was &quot;like&quot; maqam music. I wanted it<br/>&gt;  to be a shameless mimicry, a dumbing down of sorts just to fit it in<br/>&gt;  the regular temperament paradigm, and that was it.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;d use the term &quot;maqamesque&quot; for this kind of temperament, the<br/>suffix -esque, as in burlesque, emphasizing the idea of a<br/>simplification or variation reflecting an artist&apos;s experience of a<br/>given musical tradition, for example the things that especially stood<br/>out or brought special pleasure. And I have no problem at all with<br/>this.</p><p>What I want to emphasize, however, is that rank-2 and rank-3 systems<br/>can also nicely if imperfectly emulate features of Maqam music such as<br/>unequal neutral steps and intervals, and comma steps at least crudely<br/>evoking some of the fluidity of flexible-pitch performances. And the<br/>theory and practice is already there.</p><p>The math isn&apos;t that complex, and it&apos;s mostly rather concrete. One<br/>great starting point for a 24-note rank-3 system is George Secor&apos;s<br/>larger and irregular 29-HTT, which includes two chains of 703.579-cent<br/>generators at 58.090 cents for some pure 7/4 sevenths.</p><p>Take more generally two 12-MOS or 17-MOS chains with a generator in<br/>the range of 703.55-703.90 cents, spaced for pure 7/4 sevenths, and we<br/>have one very attractive variety of tuning for Maqam. In 2010, Ozan<br/>Yarman focused my attention on an 11/10 step for a Turkish version of<br/>Maqam Huseyni, and 26/21 as a characteristic third for an historical<br/>Ottoman Rast, leading me to a system with an average fifth at 703.871<br/>cents. This summer Jacques Dudon emphasized the importance in Maqam of<br/>near-pure fifths, talking me down to 703.658 cents. In 1024-ED2, the<br/>two chains are spaced at 57.422 cents apart.</p><p>This is actually &quot;quasi-rank-3,&quot; or &quot;shaggy rank-3&quot; as I often say,<br/>because a 1024-ED2 synthesizer does not have any 703.658-cent fifths;<br/>rather we have a chain alternating sizes of 703.125 and 704.297 cents,<br/>with six smaller and five larger fifths. Maybe it&apos;s at once<br/>&quot;quasi-regular&quot; because this is the most even approximation of a<br/>703.658-cent generator possible, and &quot;subtly irregular&quot; because some<br/>fifths are twice as impure as others!</p><p>Anyway, we get 14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and 11:10 all within 3 cents of<br/>just; lots of septimal approximations; and some comma steps useful for<br/>the kinds of expressive intonation you mentioned. For example, I can<br/>play a Turkish Rast with a usual bright third at 370 cents -- but<br/>with this step expressively lowered in a descending cadential approach<br/>to 346 cents.</p><p>One thing I&apos;ve learned is that while the complex irregular tunings and<br/>refinements of natural flexible-pitch performance in Maqam and other<br/>traditions have no substitute, a rank-3 system of 24 notes, for<br/>example, can often have 8-10 note subsets reasonably approximating an<br/>irregular scheme tuned on a Persian santur or the like.</p><p>My main point is that while intonational theories, Near Eastern and<br/>otherwise, are constantly evolving, the kind of regular temperament<br/>theory I&apos;m describing is quite adequate to observe lots of commas and<br/>emulate some finer points of Maqam intonation, however imperfectly,<br/>while also getting lots of near-3:2 fifths.</p><p>A final point I&apos;d like to clarify, which doesn&apos;t in any way exclude a<br/>beautiful 7-note system like Jacques Dudon&apos;s Mohajira or Ibina; or a<br/>7-note or 10-note set of Erv Wilson&apos;s Rast-Bayyati matrix.</p><p>While a maqam like conjunct or disjunct Rast, the latter considered<br/>the &quot;Arab fundamental scale,&quot; can indeed be generated from a chain of<br/>seven unequal or equal neutral thirds, some very important maqamat<br/>like Bayyati, Nahawand, and Hijaz require semitone steps as well as<br/>the whole tones and neutral or Zalzalian seconds which are indeed so<br/>characteristic.</p><p>When we get up to around 17 generators, then we get enough of a<br/>variety of these whole tones, semitones, and neutral steps to realize<br/>lots of maqamat.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
