One of my conclusions is that<br/>although Aaron&apos;s tuning of 1523 certainly invites a 1/4-comma reading,<br/>the first compelling although nonrigorous description of such a<br/>regular tuning may date to 1555.]</p><p>First of all, _Sumer is icumen in_ is a very striking English piece<br/>likely from around the 13th century (proposed dates range from around<br/>1240 to 1310), showing a trait described by the theorist now known to<br/>the world, thanks to an ordering of treatises by a 19th-century editor<br/>named Coussemaker, as Anonymous IV (c. 1275?): the preference in the<br/>&quot;Westcountry&quot; of England for thirds as &quot;the best consonances,&quot;<br/>sometimes used in concluding sonorities.</p><p>However, while the _Sumer_ canon uses thirds as conclusive intervals<br/>(or at any rate intervals occurring at any point of conclusion an<br/>ensemble chooses for what might be taken as a perpetual canon), this<br/>does not mean that the piece must be or should be analyzed in terms of<br/>18th-century key concepts. While I realize that this is a natural<br/>language for many people, I&apos;d like to offer my own &quot;natural&quot;<br/>impression, not necessarily more or less accurate.</p><p>From my perspective, the _Sumer_ canon maybe relates to conventional<br/>13th-century verticality of a kind found on the Continent and also in<br/>some other English schools somewhat in the way that 20th-century jazz<br/>may often relate to Classic/Romantic progressions, with African and<br/>African-American elements also involved.</p><p>If we take the two supporting parts of the _pes_ (Latin for &quot;foot,&quot; or<br/>in later terms the &quot;ground bass&quot;), we get what might be a repeated<br/>and quite orthodox 13th-century progression, indeed a common cadential<br/>figure, given here in a simplified form:</p><p>C4  Bb3  C4<br/>F3  G3   F3</p><p>5   m3   5</p><p>In Continental terms, we have a stable fifth F-C, a mildly unstable<br/>minor third G3-Bb3, and the resolution of that third by expansion back<br/>to the stable fifth F3-C4.</p><p>We could use either Bb or B-natural for the unstable middle sonority;<br/>both B and Bb are regular steps of the medieval gamut, and both forms<br/>occur frequently in conventional 13th-century writing, so that the<br/>third expanding to a fifth might be either minor or major. Fluid<br/>shifts between Bb and B-natural in the same piece are common, for<br/>example in various French motets of this era.</p><p>While modal theory in the 13th century is applied mainly to the<br/>formulas of plainsong (liturgical chant) rather than polyphony, we<br/>could describe the mode here as _tritus_ or the F-mode in its variant<br/>with consistent use of Bb. Tritus means the &quot;third&quot; variety of mode,<br/>the four usual varieties concluding respectively on resting notes or<br/>_finals_ of D, E, F, and G. A medieval musician might also describe<br/>this as one color of F Lydian, and a 16th-century theorist such as<br/>Glareanus or Zarlino as F Ionian (distinguishing the diatonic mode of<br/>C-C, or of F-F with consistent Bb, from F-F with prominent use of<br/>B-natural).</p><p>Anyway, we can add a third part to get a complete Continental-style<br/>sound and also a _Sumer_-like melodic motive. Without getting into<br/>the medieval metrical patterns or rhythmic modes, why don&apos;t I notate<br/>this in a lively 6/8 or 6/4:</p><p>1  2  3  4  5  6 | 1</p><p>F4    E4 D4    E4  F4<br/>C4       Bb3       C4<br/>F3       G3        F3</p><p>            (M6-8 + m3-5)</p><p>Here we start at a complete trine (2:3:4) of F3-C4-F4, move to an<br/>unstable &quot;split fifth&quot; divided by the middle voice into two thirds,<br/>G3-Bb3-D4, with the upper voice moving from the fifth to the major<br/>sixth to form a momentary sonority of G3-Bb3-E4 which expands by<br/>stepwise contrary motion back to our stable &quot;home&quot; or final of repose,<br/>again our complete trine F3-C4-F4.</p><p>In addition to the m3-5 resolution between the two lowest parts, we<br/>now have an M6-8 resolution between the outer parts -- and these two<br/>expanding resolutions very nicely unite in a mutually reinforcing way,<br/>bringing us to a full trine. Incidentally, through most of the 13th<br/>century, in England as on the Continent sixths may have been deemed<br/>rather more tense than thirds; at least one scholar has concluded that<br/>while pervasive thirds are typical of English writing, sixths tend to<br/>get used more in cadential resolutions to the octave. By around 1300,<br/>sixths come more into vogue in England as pervasive intervals.</p><p>In this version, we have a tritone between the two upper voices,<br/>Bb3-E4, which acts rather like a &quot;counterfeit fourth,&quot; proceeding by<br/>parallel motion to the upper fourth of the complete trine F3-C4-F4.<br/>While this tritone certainly adds some color and extra tension, it&apos;s<br/>the m3-5 and M6-8 resolutions by contrary motion which mainly guide<br/>the progression. Here&apos;s another very common 13th-century version of<br/>this kind of figure, this time with M3-5 and M6-8:</p><p>1  2  3  4  5  6 | 1</p><p>F4    E4 D4    E4  F4<br/>C4       B4        C4<br/>F3       G3        F3</p><p>            (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>What happens in the English style of _Sumer_, however, is that other<br/>voices are constantly adding a third A3 to our trine on the final F,<br/>so that, in orthodox 13th-century Continental terms, the expected<br/>resolution is avoided or &quot;obscured.&quot; As Anonymous IV notes, this is a<br/>distinctive trait of music in Western England. Then, as now, it would<br/>seem that one musician&apos;s &quot;thwarted resolution&quot; can be another&apos;s &quot;full<br/>concord.&quot;</p><p>Some remarks around 1300 by the English theorist Walter Odington that<br/>major and minor thirds at 81:64 and 32:27 are close to 5:4 and 6:5,<br/>and that singers can make them fully concordant, suggest in connection<br/>with such stylistic traits an intonation leaning toward these simple<br/>ratios for thirds.</p><p>How this may have affected English keyboard tunings is an open<br/>question, and one interesting piece of evidence is a treatise of 1373<br/>recommending a basic tuning of the seven diatonic notes in usual<br/>Pythagorean, with accidental semitones added as the arithmetic mean of<br/>a whole-tone, i.e. with a pipe having a length equal to the average of<br/>the two notes of the whole-tone it is dividing, e.g. 18:17:16.</p><p>FAQ aside: maybe this is the first practical instance of a &quot;Rational<br/>Intonation&quot; (RI) tuning, with &quot;tempering by integer ratio&quot;; one result<br/>is that major thirds involving accidentals are somewhere between<br/>Pythagorean and 5:4, possibly one of the attractions of the tuning in<br/>an English setting, apart from the simplified mathematics.</p><p>Anyway, what _Sumer_ illustrates for me in part is how standard<br/>progressions of one style can take on a very different quality if<br/>musical parameters such as the definition of stable saturation are<br/>changed. Just as a Classic European music enthusiast might recognize<br/>jazz progressions -- but with &quot;strange&quot; added sevenths or ninths -- so<br/>in _Sumer_ I can recognize familiar 13th-century Continental patterns<br/>and progressions, but with curious added thirds.</p><p>This brings us to a point you rightly raise in a Renaissance setting,<br/>Ibo Ortgies: the concept of a &quot;discant clause&quot; (Latin _clausula_, with<br/>an Elizabethan English equivalent &quot;close&quot;).</p><p>While _clausula_ in this Renaissance context means a &quot;close&quot; or<br/>&quot;cadence,&quot; the unwary bystander may find it helpful to know that<br/>&quot;discant&quot; in Gothic terms means the art of part-music for two or more<br/>voices, and in Renaissance terms it may mean the art of two-voice<br/>counterpoint, often improvised.</p><p>Lending meaning to both words in &quot;discant clausula,&quot; Renaissance<br/>music features various two-voice cadential formulas often superimposed<br/>or combined to build multi-voice cadences. For example, one favorite<br/>formula is a resolution from major sixth to octave (carried over from<br/>Gothic practice), introduced by the characteristic Renaissance element<br/>of a 7-6 suspension:</p><p>1   2  &amp; | 1<br/>F4     E4  F4<br/>A3  G3     F3</p><p>     7-M6 - 8</p><p>Here I warmly agree that a meantone or meantone-like intonation makes<br/>the minor seventh G3-F4 a somewhat more complex or decisive<br/>dissonance, and the resolving major sixth G3-E4 close to a pure 5:3.<br/>The theorists of this era tell us how the tension of the dissonance<br/>makes the following concord (here the major sixth) all the more sweet,<br/>and an intonation at or near 5:3 optimizes this ideal in a Renaissance<br/>setting.</p><p>I am inclined to agree that singers, like keyboardists, of the 16th<br/>century may have leaned toward large cadential semitones -- 16:15<br/>(~112 cents) in classic just intonation under the syntonic diatonic,<br/>and about 117.1 cents in 1/4-comma meantone (likely with some adaptive<br/>variations for singers tending toward pure vertical concords and<br/>quasi-regular melodic steps).</p><p>The same considerations would apply to multi-voice cadences, for<br/>example this four-part version:</p><p>1   2  &amp; | 1<br/>F4     E4  F4<br/>C4  C4     C4<br/>A3  G3     F3<br/>F3  C3     F2</p><p>Here our two-voice 7-6-8 close or cadence between the next-to-lowest<br/>and highest voices (tenor and superius or soprano) gets combined with<br/>other intervals and resolutions. In addition to the 7-6 suspension,<br/>we have a 4-3 suspension between the outer voices.</p><p>My reading of 16th-century writers such as Zarlino (1558) and Morley<br/>(1597) is that the resolving major tenth C3-E4 should be _sweet_,<br/>which in Renaissance terms means 5:4 or something very close.</p><p>In addition to the concluding 6-8 progression, we also have a<br/>characteristic 16th-century progression between the bass and one of<br/>the upper voices which Vicentino (1555) illustrates in his examples of<br/>common practice and Zarlino describes as typical of multi-voice<br/>writing: a progression from the major third or tenth to the unison or<br/>octave, with the upper voice ascending by a semitone and the bass<br/>falling a fifth (as here) or rising a fourth. Vicentino&apos;s language in<br/>related discussions suggest that this bass motion might help in<br/>defining a mode, classically analyzed as the division of an octave<br/>into a species of fifth and fourth.</p><p>In this kind of setting, a cadential semitone at around 16:15 seems<br/>fine to me, although Mark Lindley has persuasively suggested that the<br/>late 15th and early 16th centuries may have been an era of some mixed<br/>feelings about this use of less concise diatonic semitones, a<br/>consequence of the quest for more smooth and restful thirds.</p><p>Thus while the transition from Pythagorean to meantone tuning for<br/>keyboards might reasonably be dated around 1450-1480, with Ramos<br/>(1482) as interpreted by Lindley providing hints of its prevalence,<br/>and Gaffurius (1496) expressly declaring that fifths are tempered,<br/>singers may have continued to lean toward Pythagorean intonation in<br/>performing Ockeghem around 1480, or even Josquin around 1500.</p><p>As I read Aaron, his remarks on keyboard temperament in the<br/>_Toscanello_ (1523) describe 1/4-comma meantone or something very like<br/>it (at least for the first five notes) in nonmathematical but very<br/>poetic terms. Some of his examples of modal cadences concluding on<br/>sonorities with thirds -- with accidental alterations in some cases<br/>where called for to obtain closing _major_ thirds, which he advocates<br/>in the _Toscanello_ as more pleasing at certain points -- seem very<br/>much in keeping with this kind of tuning system for keyboards.</p><p>Speaking as a very enthusiastic advocate for Pythagorean and also<br/>super-Pythagorean tunings in a Gothic or neo-Gothic context, I would<br/>be inclined much to agree with Lindley that the continued reference to<br/>Pythagorean theory in the early meantone era, as late as Aaron, may<br/>reflect in part a kind of conceptual conservatism. The reversed role<br/>of major and minor semitones (respectively now diatonic and chromatic,<br/>in contrast to Pythagorean) may have taken some time to &quot;codify.&quot;</p><p>Recognizing Lindley&apos;s thoughtful and enriching treatment of Aaron, I<br/>would add that this interpreter also has his own theoretical agenda<br/>(as do we all): he evidently wishes to take Aaron as a cautionary<br/>example on two themes. First, Lindley wants to challenge the<br/>conception that 1/4-comma was _the_ near-universal 16th-century<br/>standard; secondly, he seeks to counter the widespread modern<br/>presupposition that 16th-century &quot;meantone&quot; tunings were necessarily<br/>regular or conceived by tuners in a rigorous mathematical way.</p><p>Demonstrating that Aaron&apos;s instructions do not define 1/4-comma -- or<br/>any other flavor of meantone! -- in mathematically rigorous terms, nor<br/>do they require that all fifths be tempered by the same amount, nicely<br/>fits in with both items of this agenda. It is an ingenious argument,<br/>ably presented.</p><p>However, I also find it natural to read Aaron as at least permissive<br/>evidence for something like 1/4-comma meantone in 1523. I agree that<br/>the first _mathematical_ definitions do not come until Zarlino (1571)<br/>and Salinas (1577), and also with Lindley&apos;s witty observation that we<br/>need not assume that either of these theorists was the first to place<br/>a keyboard in this temperament.</p><p>If we regard Aaron&apos;s description as defining some form of meantone,<br/>but not _necessarily_ 1/4-comma, is there any evidence before 1571<br/>that 1/4-comma was in use?</p><p>Here I would propose the date of 1555, and the treatise of Nicola<br/>Vicentino, as a source pointing decisively to the use of 1/4-comma or<br/>something very close, albeit without any rigorous mathematical<br/>definition in terms of fractions of the syntonic comma or the like<br/>(Zarlino does define his 2/7-comma system rigorously in 1558, but<br/>other meantones such as 1/4-comma only in 1571).</p><p>The compelling evidence, for me, is the nature of both of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>two tuning systems for his archicembalo. I agree with Lindley that<br/>Vicentino&apos;s statement that the first 12 notes are tuned as in common<br/>keyboard instruments does not in itself address the question of the<br/>precise temperament, but his other musical parameters do.</p><p>His first system divides the octave into 31 conceptually equal parts,<br/>with all intervals available from all steps -- thus it must closely<br/>approximate 31-tone equal temperament, or 31-tET, which in turn is<br/>almost identical to 1/4-comma.</p><p>His second system combines &quot;perfect fifths and perfect thirds,&quot;<br/>implying that the major thirds on each manual are &quot;perfect,&quot; or pure,<br/>and thus also describing in nonrigorous terms what Zarlino in 1571<br/>will more formally define as a &quot;1/4-comma&quot; temperament.</p><p>If we regard Aaron&apos;s instructions as inviting but not compelling<br/>evidence for a 1/4-comma temperament, then one might draw the<br/>interesting conclusion that this tuning or something almost identical<br/>was first compellingly defined -- albeit nonrigorously -- in the<br/>context of a full 31-note cycle.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=19408 href="#19408">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/25/2001 7:27:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
