This is<br/>&gt;  an improved and extended reprint of _Orgel-Probe_ of 1681. In the<br/>&gt;  last chapter the tuning issue is brought up, but the tunings given in the<br/>&gt;  first edition of 1681 are not repeated. So why would he remove his tunings<br/>&gt;  if he was so proud of them?</p><p>They were removed in 1698 because he referred totally to his major work on<br/>the subject, _Musicalische Temperatur_ of 1691, since it deals with<br/>temperament in depth.  &quot;With regard to the matter of temperament, there is no<br/>need to add anything in particular, since the kind reader can find a detailed<br/>discussion and demonstration in out treatise on temperament with an appendix<br/>on the monochord.&quot;</p><p>My English translation of Orgel-Probe (1698?), then it is full of non-equal<br/>tuning preference (&quot;chock full&quot;).  &quot;Therefore, it is better to reserve the<br/>best temperament for the most used thirds&quot; - Werckmeister.</p><p>&gt;  In _Die nothwendigsten Anmerckungen und Regeln wie der Bassus continuus..._<br/>&gt;  of 1698 there is an appendix on how to tune and well-temper a keyboard.<br/>&gt;  He gives two tunings: equal temperament and an unequal one which is close<br/>&gt;  to equal temperament.</p><p>This is interesting.  However, Werckmeister may be responding to criticism<br/>that he has not properly represented ET.  He did not appreciate the huge<br/>amounts of criticism his earlier published works received.  (Of course, he<br/>received great honors as well.)</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m not a musicologist but I believe that unlimited transposition and<br/>&gt;  enharmonic exchanges in the time of Werckmeister and Bach are much more<br/>&gt;  important than key characteristics, which becomes more important in the<br/>&gt;  time after Bach.</p><p>Werckmeister (Orgel-Probe) &quot;Nowadays however, when one has to make use of the<br/>entire keyboard as though in a circle, it is quite impossible to make do with<br/>such a keyboard.  Since music, by the grace of God, has risen to such heights<br/>and changed so much, it would, indeed, be incongruous not to think of ways to<br/>improve keyboard instruments also; if for no other reason than to avoid<br/>ruining contemporary pieces, some of which are well composed, and making a<br/>mess of them.</p><p>Here Werckmeister can be understood as supporting either ET or an irregular<br/>12.  This is the confusion that persisted, I suspect, that makes Mr.<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s genuine contribution to musical art.  As I understand it,<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s explanation of the full &quot;circle&quot; of keys is ground breaking.<br/>It should be understandable that this accomplishment overshadowed the<br/>particular distinctions of particular keys.</p><p>&gt;  W. was very devote and perhaps more obsessed with Christianity, God,<br/>&gt;  mysticism and numerology than with tuning. To understand him and his<br/>&gt;  way of thinking even in regard with tuning it might well be worthwhile<br/>&gt;  to investigate this aspect of his personality.<br/>&gt;<br/>Jan Chiapusso, author of an essay entitled &quot;Bach&apos;s Attitude Towards History,&quot;<br/>wrote: &quot;For practical purposes Bach certainly did not have any recourse to<br/>mathematical calculations, although he surely was thoroughly acquainted with<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s scientific treatment of that subject.</p><p>&quot;Werckmeister, for reasons of his Lutheran orthodoxy, the religious feeling<br/>in his writings and his practical attitude towards tempered tuning, must have<br/>appealed most to Bach.  Werckmeister was also a warm, personal friend of<br/>Johann Gottfried Walther, who, as is well known, had considerable influence<br/>upon Bach during the Weimar period.&quot;  (Jan, Chiapusso, The Musical Quarterly,<br/>39, p. 413, 1953)</p><p>I think that tuning was an expression of God for Werckmeister.</p><p>Werckmeister does show awareness of the expressive nature of distinct keys,<br/>though.  &quot;Thus, this temperament must also incorporate variance, consistent<br/>with all of nature; one day is not quite so warm or cold as the next.&quot;</p><p>_Paradoxical Discourse_ has never been translated and I don&apos;t know what is in<br/>it.  This is a problem.  I am influenced by the fact that it was published<br/>after Werckmeister died.  There is a certain paradox in this whole<br/>discussion.  It is a delicate operation to imagine yourself a witness to a<br/>distant past, to separate the specific from the general.
