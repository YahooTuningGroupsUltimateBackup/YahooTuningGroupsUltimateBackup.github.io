We see how a simple thing like &quot;bent frets&quot;<br/>neither bring the designer any real money ( in fact cost them a ton) and  prevents any real progress in the musical<br/>arts.<br/>    There are quite  a few 31 tione instruments in this design at his house. For mallet instruments , i prefer the<br/>Bosonquet family. Even moving from tuning to tuning , one understands the underlying logic right away and even the<br/>shift sometimes with gliss played up instead of down is no problem to get used to.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Meantone keyboards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I checked and Erv did patent the keyboard concept, which I find<br/>&gt; deplorable unless he had a good reason for doing so.

Having access to a two manual  scalatron at Erv&apos;s , it doesn&apos;t compare to Bosonquet.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Meantone keyboards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two keyboards stacked -- sounds like the original Scalatron -- fine<br/>&gt; for experimenting, but please, take my word for it:  It was very<br/>&gt; clumsy for performing anything with more than 12 tones/octave and<br/>&gt; required a virtuoso technique to play anything on two keyboards at<br/>&gt; once in a fast tempo.  The greatly improved fingering facility<br/>&gt; allowed by the generalized keyboard made it &quot;no contest.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
