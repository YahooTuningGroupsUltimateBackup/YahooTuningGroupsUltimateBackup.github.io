I signed up after finding The Tuning Punks&apos; page on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>.  I have a couple of questions and I&apos;m sure they will amuse you with their elementary level, but here goes...  How can I tune my MIDI keyboard to something other than 100 cent intervals?  I&apos;ve wanted to experiment with this, but the logistics are holding me up.  The other question is very similar in nature.  Where can I get a neck for a guitar that&apos;s fretted with different spacing... 19 per octave, etc.?  If anyone could give me a couple of hints, I&apos;d appreciate it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>James</p></div>
