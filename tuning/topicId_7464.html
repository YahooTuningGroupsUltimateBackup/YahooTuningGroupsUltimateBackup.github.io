When you came to visit me at my house, you described your<br/>interest in the finity concept to me and I told you that the closest thing I<br/>had heard of was Fokker&apos;s PD work. I knew very little about it at the time,<br/>but due to your interest I dug into it and found many interesting things,<br/>thus all my posts on the subject. I&apos;m personally more interested in<br/>temperament, since it seems like the next logical step -- once you&apos;ve found<br/>your periodicity block, distibute the unison vectors over the generating<br/>intervals so that there is no sudden &quot;break&quot; at the edge of the block --<br/>you&apos;re liberated and can represent an infinite expanse in the lattice with a<br/>finite number of notes. Even if you want to keep the simultaneities in JI,<br/>if you&apos;re using a computer you can use the temperament as the basis for an<br/>adaptive JI scheme. There are other reasons I like temperament too. But for<br/>you, Joe, I&apos;ve focused on strict JI structures -- hope you&apos;ve found them<br/>valuable.</p></div>
