Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2002 10:50:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and my apologies for using this public forum to<br/>report some private e-mail problems which might be affecting people here<br/>who have been trying to reach me. Since some of the matters for these<br/>e-mails do relate to our tuning community, I hope this won&apos;t be too much<br/>of a license.</p><p>Please let me explain that I am unable to download any files from the<br/>Yahoo site because some months ago, they put in a Sign-In Web page<br/>requiring a browser with support for secure log-in (HTTPS). There&apos;s a line<br/>of the text on this Sign-In screen suggesting that there _should_ be a<br/>menu item for a &quot;Standard&quot; login, without the security barrier, but I<br/>might guess that the intended HTML could be broken, since I can&apos;t find any<br/>such link in Lynx, including a possible hidden link.</p><p>The Yahoo FAQ helpfully explains why the secure mode might fail, and<br/>mentions the option of Standard mode, but doesn&apos;t explain how to access<br/>the latter option. This suggests to me that &quot;Standard&quot; _should_ be a<br/>self-evident link, and that something could be wrong with the HTML.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried following their technical support or &quot;Customer Care&quot; procedure<br/>to report this problem, using their Web forms and e-mail followups, but<br/>have gotten no response -- this has been going on for some months. It<br/>means that I can&apos;t login, download files with links posted here, or do<br/>other things requiring a Sign-in.</p><p>As to e-mail, I&apos;ve recently tried to get in touch with George Secor and<br/>John Chalmers. A recent response here from George Secor suggests that one<br/>of my outgoing private messages got through, but I haven&apos;t received any<br/>new incoming mail from either George or John, and have been unable, as<br/>explained above, to access the file of previously sent e-mails at Yahoo. I<br/>have pretty confidently figured out the password, George, and if that file<br/>could be played at some other Web site, I could download it.</p><p>If someone had the clout to get Yahoo to straighten out the &quot;Standard<br/>mode&quot; login with Lynx, I could download it there too; so far, that hasn&apos;t<br/>happened.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m very concerned about this problem with some of my incoming<br/>e-mail -- I&apos;m not sure if outgoing e-mail is being affected, although<br/>Tuning List posts have been showing up in the Digests I get (no problem<br/>there) and at Yahoo (fortunately, I don&apos;t need to Sign-in to read the<br/>archives or latest posts).</p><p>Since other people here could also conceivably have tried to reach me, I<br/>am reporting the problem here. Earlier this week I had my ISP remove a new<br/>e-mail filtering system which I was unable to access, which was meant to<br/>intercept &quot;suspicious&quot; e-mail (junk mail, viruses), but might be<br/>intercepting other legitimate personal e-mail as well. I was unable to<br/>access the Web site for viewing, screening, and downloading these<br/>&quot;suspicious&quot; messages, for reasons very similar to the Yahoo problem. I<br/>hope that removing this filtering might help with the incoming e-mail<br/>problem; I was told that it had been removed later on the same day that I<br/>made the request.</p><p>My concern is to keep up essential communications, and also to let anyone<br/>affected know what has been happening. Thank you for your patience and<br/>your understanding as to why I am posting this information here.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2002 1:04:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

It&apos;s true that a given tuning in<br/>either approach _could_ be approximated, more or less, by a tuning<br/>using the other; but why not enjoy the variety of both, as we seem to<br/>do quite happily?</p><p>For your septimal pentatonic, I would say that the simple arithmetic<br/>of the septimal comma at 64:63, or about 27.26 cents, suggests that<br/>for a five-note scale, the alternatives are either JI or some very<br/>appreciable &quot;compromise&quot; of the fifths and fourths, the 7-based<br/>intervals, or both.</p><p>You _could_, of course, do this in 22-tET with the fifths about 7<br/>cents wide, or also in George Secor&apos;s fine 17-note well-temperament<br/>with the fifths a bit more than 5 cents wide.</p><p>You _could_ also, of course, take those five notes of your instrument<br/>from some &quot;near-just&quot; system designed to use lots more notes,<br/>including some of the ones I use.</p><p>However, for both of us, simply tuning it in JI is a very appealing<br/>solution. While there&apos;s a potential &quot;bug&quot; in this solution, that bug<br/>could also be a very valuable feature in the right musical context.<br/>Here I&apos;ll arbitrarily use D for the lowest note of your pentatonic:</p><p>      D        F     G     A       C     D<br/>     1/1      7/6   4/3   3/2     7/4   2/1<br/>      0       267   498   702     969   1200</p><p>Here the potential &quot;complication&quot; is the narrow 21:16 fourth between G<br/>and C, about 471 cents.</p><p>However, that same narrow fourth can take part in some fine &quot;crunchy&quot;<br/>sonorities of a kind celebrated by Keenan Pepper, who discussed the<br/>use of 16:21:24:27. Here, if your instrument has a second octave, that<br/>would be, for example, G3-C4-D4-F4 (with C4 as middle C).</p><p>If the instrument has only one octave, you could still do G3-C4-D4, or<br/>16:21:24.</p><p>An advantage of JI is that it often generates new and unexpected<br/>intervals of this kind, which can be seen not as &quot;flaws&quot; but as<br/>stimulating resources.</p><p>The usefulness of these intervals depends, of course, on style and<br/>taste. In a 5-limit JI system used for conventional 16th-century<br/>European music, fifths or thirds of other than the expected size are<br/>often simply &quot;navigational hazards&quot;: but in a septimal pentatonic,<br/>something like 16:21:24:28 could be an invigorating touch.</p><p>This has become one of my favorite special effects in 3-7 JI systems,<br/>which I like to emulate in temperaments with intervals near 16:21<br/>also.</p><p>If I were going to bring up the question of any possible &quot;refinement&quot;<br/>of your beautiful JI tuning, however hypothetically or playfully<br/>(since it changes the terms of the problem a bit), I might mention the<br/>idea of an instrument with an extra sixth string, which could be tuned<br/>to 16/9, thus &quot;fixing&quot; the 21:16 &quot;problem&quot; -- when you want it fixed,<br/>that is -- while still leaving that interval available when you choose<br/>to use it:</p><p>      D       F     G     A      C1  C2       D<br/>     1/1     7/6   4/3   3/2     7/4 16/9    2/1<br/>      0      267   498   702     969 996     1200</p><p>This is an approach I take in some of my own 3-7 tunings; it means a<br/>bit more complication, but keeps an uncompromising JI approach while<br/>increasing the range of musical intervals and options. Now we have<br/>available either the pure fourth G-C2, or the 21:16 at G-C1.</p><p>There&apos;s also a 27-cent step C1-C2, a real &quot;microinterval&quot; that might<br/>have interesting melodic uses.</p><p>Anyway, your JI scale made me realize that often I tend to use JI<br/>systems where the 7-based intervals are &quot;auxilliary&quot; degrees, so that<br/>even if I play in parallel sonorities like 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24,<br/>the melodies often move mostly in Pythagorean steps (apart from<br/>cadences, where 28:27 semitones or thirdtones are routine).</p><p>While this kind of arrangement is ideal for lots of my music in three<br/>or four parts, your post made me realize that to play a scale like<br/>yours, I would typically find myself moving between the two manuals to<br/>get the basic five notes.</p><p>This made me realize a special advantage of some tunings I have with<br/>2-3-7-9 JI where I can simply play D-F-G-A-C-D, or whatever, and get<br/>your pentatonic scale. I want to try it, for example, over a drone,<br/>where it should be really delightful.</p><p>Specifically, a bit more than a year and half ago, I set up a 3-7 JI<br/>tuning based on the diatonic of Archytas, where D-A is wide by a 64:63<br/>-- but haven&apos;t used it much. Your scale gives me a great reason to get<br/>better acquainted with that tuning -- thank you!</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2002 7:33:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

I&apos;m still working through the cadential<br/>possibilities and produce sets of &quot;rules&quot; for these and for melodic movement and counterpoint,<br/>influenced in part by the work of Dufay, Ockeghem, Obrecht and others. Often I bend the rules or<br/>do the opposite of what is required.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Specifically, a bit more than a year and half ago, I set up a 3-7 JI<br/>&gt; tuning based on the diatonic of Archytas, where D-A is wide by a 64:63<br/>&gt; -- but haven&apos;t used it much.

It&apos;s good to be reminded of the biases that I have as<br/>someone relying on digital technologies, as well as to get the benefit<br/>of your ideas and experiences.</p><p>Kraig, your point about a six-note scale for ratios of 3-7 resembling<br/>a pentatonic plus one of its transpositions made me look at this in<br/>one of my 3-7 tunings, where indeed I could combine these two scales<br/>to get a six-note set. Here I&apos;ll use &quot;v&quot; to show a note lowered a<br/>64:63, or comma of Archytas as George Secor has aptly named it, from<br/>Pythagorean, taking E as a reference:</p><p>           E4       Gv4    A4    B4       Dv4     E4<br/>           1/1      7/6    4/3   3/2      7/4     2/1</p><p>           A4       Cv4    D4    E4       Gv4     A4<br/>           1/1      7/6    4/3   3/2      7/4     2/1</p><p>Here&apos;s the six-note set with 7/4 and 16/9 with reference to E:</p><p>           E4       Gv4    A4    B4       Dv4 D4    E4<br/>           1/1      7/6    4/3   3/2      7/4 16/9  2/1</p><p>Have I interpreted your comment about &quot;modulations&quot; or transpositions<br/>correctly?</p><p>Now for some of your remarks, Alison:</p><p>&gt; Yes, I forgot to mention that the slendros in particular can be<br/>&gt; reasonably approximated in 22 tet, and I have a 22tet guitar I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; found that the cents difference between JI and 22 tet doesn&apos;t bother<br/>&gt; me, particularly if I use ostinatos and other linear structures.</p><p>Maybe we could look at this as a kind of approach somewhere between<br/>3-7 JI and a typical gamelan tuning with fifths at around 720 cents.</p><p>&gt; Yes, I prefer sonority to dissonance here. Sounds more appealing<br/>&gt; somehow. To my ears the timbre of a slightly &quot;zingy&quot; stretched<br/>&gt; string makes the 21:16 most appealing. I have a second octave and<br/>&gt; with the careful use of contrary motion in simple counterpoint the<br/>&gt; interval can be used as a particularly fine suspension.</p><p>I&apos;d love to hear how this sounds on your instrument. On keyboard, I<br/>find that it often has the effect of an &quot;energetic consonance,&quot; more<br/>or less -- in a suspension, or note against note. I could ask more<br/>about your style, but maybe a recording would explain best (or a live<br/>performance best of all, if I were in your neighborhood).</p><p>&gt; A very simple but effective elaboration. I can actually do this with<br/>&gt; my marimbas, and now that you&apos;ve pointed this out I&apos;m keen to look<br/>&gt; at other such refinements, especially in the very uneven pelog type<br/>&gt; scales that I use.</p><p>This suggests to me that we might share a liking for something like<br/>this, one of Lou Harrison&apos;s pelog-style pentatonics:</p><p>          E4  Fv4       A4     B4   Cv5     E5<br/>          1/1 28/27     4/3    3/2  14/9    2/1<br/>          0    63       498    702  765     1200<br/>           28:27   9:7     9:8   28:27  9:7<br/>            63     435     204    63    435</p><p>I love this scale, and also a variant I use with Gv4 (7/6). It can<br/>encourage some energetic patterns, with the uneven steps maybe lending<br/>encouraging (although Javanese/Balinese pelogs can also get energetic<br/>with quite different steps).</p><p>&gt; I use the pedal a lot, either as a drone or inverted drone which<br/>&gt; gives depth and meaning to the mode in use. I also like to modulate<br/>&gt; to other modes with two or three common tones, either on the same<br/>&gt; drone or on one of the tones of my basic slendro. I&apos;m still working<br/>&gt; through the cadential possibilities and produce sets of &quot;rules&quot; for<br/>&gt; these and for melodic movement and counterpoint, influenced in part<br/>&gt; by the work of Dufay, Ockeghem, Obrecht and others. Often I bend the<br/>&gt; rules or do the opposite of what is required.</p><p>The inverted drone is something I should try. Your synthesis sounds<br/>really exciting, and experience indeed seems the best education in<br/>finding the &quot;rules&quot; for such a style.</p><p>One of the things which really drew me into listening to gamelan, and<br/>especially slendro, is the slow counterpoint on the instrument called<br/>_gender_, with lots of fifths or fourths and octaves, a bit like &quot;down<br/>home Gothic&quot; for me, and yet different. You remind me of some old<br/>listening moments -- and your style could bring some new ones to lots<br/>of people.

For example, the major second (Pythagorean 9:8) and<br/>minor seventh (Pythagorean 16:9) are regarded as having some degree of<br/>&quot;concord&quot; or &quot;compatibility&quot; by some medieval musicians, but treated<br/>cautiously as discords in usual Renaissance styles.</p><p>&gt; Or the warning not to return to the same consonance after a<br/>&gt; dissonance. This rules out auxiliaries, but what if I return to one<br/>&gt; of the crunchy variants that you talked about?</p><p>Here I might have two quick replies, which might lead to a conclusion<br/>about like this: &quot;Do what seems right in a given piece or style, and<br/>feel free to experiment with rules and interpretations.&quot;</p><p>First, the rule you quote might come from a Renaissance theorist like<br/>Tinctoris; dissonance treatment in the 15th-16th century era is<br/>relatively strict. Even in this era, however, auxiliary tones or the<br/>like certainly occur, for example something like this in an ornamented<br/>passage:</p><p>B4 A4 B4 C5 D5 ...<br/>G4          G4 ...<br/>3  2  3  4  5<br/>-------</p><p>This isn&apos;t to say that you might not choose to avoid auxilliaries as a<br/>stylistic choice, of course -- if an interpretation of a rule you see<br/>leads to a musically pleasing result, or a fruitful line of<br/>creativity, historical precedents or interpretations shouldn&apos;t get in<br/>the way.</p><p>With &quot;crunchy variants,&quot; one approach would be to regard them as<br/>relatively &quot;concordant&quot; sonorities, following the approach you<br/>describe above of defining concord and discord to fit a given piece or<br/>style.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to say, &quot;Let the rules serve the music rather than vice<br/>versa&quot; -- but, of course, sometimes sticking to a given rule could be<br/>a creative way of reaching a result that you might not find otherwise.</p><p>&gt; The treatment of melody likewise invites a similar approach,<br/>&gt; particularly if I adopt some of the many rules that have arisen by<br/>&gt; the time of Palestrina.
