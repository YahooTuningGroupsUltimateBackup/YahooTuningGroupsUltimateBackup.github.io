It uses the same up and down<br/>&gt; &quot;half-arrows&quot; for the 1/6-tones as the Boston notation<br/>&gt; instead of &lt; and &gt;, and uses regular up and down arrows<br/>&gt; for the 1/4-tones instead of ^ and v.  It retains + and -<br/>&gt; for the 1/12-tones.  These are unique symbols, so there&apos;s<br/>&gt; no confusion with any other markings.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I like this better than the current Maneri notation.</p><p>However the &quot;quandry&quot; is this:</p><p>1) How many performers have been practicing the arrows as 1/12<br/>tones??  If they have, and I ASSUME they have, it&apos;s going to cause<br/>confusion to have them suddenly convert the arrows to the quarter<br/>tones!  It would NEVER be good to use the SAME symbols in a different<br/>way if one were to transfer notations.  What performance confusion<br/>could result, particularly in fast sight-reading!</p><p>It would be better to go with an entirely different symbol for the<br/>quarter tones.  What *I* would personally advocate would be the<br/>REGULAR quarter tone symbols that have become somewhat &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>by now... the little &quot;half&quot; sharp for a quartertone sharp and the<br/>little &quot;backwards flat&quot; for the quartertone flat.  (As long as THAT<br/>wouldn&apos;t get confused with the &quot;half arrow.&quot;) SCORE has these as<br/>quartertone &quot;defaults&quot; in the software, WITHOUT any &quot;drawing...&quot;</p><p>I *do* like the plusses and minuses for the 1/12 tones.  I suppose<br/>the only &quot;drawback&quot; to that is that they may not be too OBVIOUS on<br/>quick reading.  Somebody else mentioned this &quot;legibility&quot; problem of<br/>the plusses and minuses, but I can&apos;t remember who it was...<br/>The &quot;arrows&quot; *do* stand out more...</p><p>2) The biggest question is how &quot;ingrained&quot; the notation is ALREADY in<br/>the Boston school.  By the look of Maneri&apos;s notation book, which I<br/>have in front of me (thanks for sending it!) it seems as though there<br/>has been a CONSIDERABLE amount of ear and notation training ALREADY<br/>taken place!</p><p>So, in other words, maybe we&apos;re a little &quot;stuck&quot; with this.  Maybe<br/>it&apos;s a little like the QWERTY keyboard at present.  Not the best, but<br/>would you like to type quickly on ANOTHER one??  Not me, if you<br/>please...</p><p>So, the question of TRAINING and USAGE is a pertinent one here.  I<br/>guess I might be prone to err on the conservative side and try to use<br/>what is ALREADY the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in this, IF it already is....</p><p>3) Well, and the third is a simple fact... the fact that I was ABLE<br/>to get the crazy Maneri quartertones in the computer... looking<br/>like &quot;square root&quot; signs!</p><p>That was a challenge to do and, naturally, I want to use them now<br/>that I did that!!!</p><p>So, in summary, I believe the assessment should be how INGRAINED the<br/>Boston notation ALREADY is in Boston or anyplace else.  How about in<br/>Ezra Sims scores??  Does he always use the Maneri??  It looks like it<br/>from the Ted Mook page...</p><p>Since Sims is one of our MOST imporant American microtonal composers,<br/>this is also an important question... since so many of his scores<br/>have circulated and have been performed...</p><p>These are important questions to answer...</p><p>&gt; This in fact was the 72-EDO notation I devised before<br/>&gt; making the ASCII adaptation, and was itself an adaptation<br/>&gt; of Herf&apos;s, with maybe a little nod to the Bostonians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seems like it was fairly easy for you to create that font...<br/>&gt; try it with this system.  I think you&apos;ll like it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, Monz, there would be nothing to that.  I would simply use the<br/>arrows for 1/4 tones rather than 1/12 tones and plusses and minuses<br/>are in just about EVERY font.  Not a problem.</p><p>However, I think you can see the reservations I have mentioned above<br/>about changing the system.</p><p>Probably it is best to err on the side of &quot;conservatism&quot; and NOT to<br/>change it if it can be implemented.  Since I finally figured out how<br/>to do it on my computer, I believe I will go with the existing<br/>notation for now... at least on this piece.</p><p>Maybe later I can change... if I want to..</p><p>&gt; And seriously, can someone who&apos;s in contact with Maneri<br/>&gt; present these ideas to him?  He may be willing to adopt<br/>&gt; them in the new edition of his book if he can be convinced<br/>&gt; that they&apos;re better.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Now this is a guess... just a guess... but I bet that Maneri isn&apos;t<br/>going to change.  I don&apos;t know, and I don&apos;t know him, so I can&apos;t find<br/>out, but it seems that the amount of work and training that has<br/>already gone into this system means that he&apos;s not going to want to<br/>give a different set of symbols to his students.  You can see from<br/>the book how much training they ALREADY have!!!</p><p>I think we&apos;re STUCK with it... square root signs and all.  CERTAINLY<br/>Maneri is NOT going to be willing to use the upwards arrows for 1/4<br/>tones instead of the accustomed 1/12 tones at this time.</p><p>That one I could almost bet money on!!!</p><p>Thanks for the commentary!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Joe</p><p>_________ _______ _______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=23336 href="#23336">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 1:16:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Folks . . . well, Boston microtonalists, from New England Conservatory and the Boston<br/>Microtonal Society, all know the Sims/Maneri notation.

It all depends<br/>on what you&apos;ve gotten accustomed to.</p><p>All of Europe used to use the confusing measuring systems<br/>that we still cling to here in the US, until the French<br/>revolutionaries decided that the metric system was the only<br/>way to go.  Of course it was a bit of an upheaval at first,<br/>but a couple of centuries down the road, *we&apos;re* the anomaly<br/>and the rest of the world looks on and wonders why.</p><p>&gt; So, in summary, I believe the assessment should be how<br/>&gt; INGRAINED the Boston notation ALREADY is in Boston or<br/>&gt; anyplace else.

Maneri picked it up from him.</p><p>Sims liked the &quot;square-root&quot; sign for quarter-tones because<br/>in 24-EDO the ratio of a quarter-tone is mathematically the<br/>square-root of the ratio of a semitone.</p><p>(2^(1/12))^(1/2) = 2^(1/24)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Seems like it was fairly easy for you to create that font...<br/>&gt; &gt; try it with this system.

Not a problem.</p><p>Well, then, if it&apos;s really that easy... try it out and show us<br/>some example scores in both notations!
