And there were also<br/>the 70&apos;s top-octave-divider (also called top-octave-synthesizer) organs.</p><p>Here&apos;s the scale for one (using the S50240 chip).</p><p>1/1 478/451 239/213 239/201 478/379 239/179 239/169 478/319 478/301 239/142<br/>239/134 478/253 2/1</p><p>It&apos;s a subset of the subharmonic series between 239 and 478.</p><p>Its worst interval deviation from 12-tET is 2.4 cents, and so the worst<br/>pitch deviation from 12-tET is 1.2 cents (with the right master oscillator<br/>frequency).</p><p>--------------<br/>Partch&apos;s folly<br/>--------------</p><p>Partch&apos;s folly sounds like, in some sense, exactly what I am trying to<br/>avoid. It seems Wendy Carlos was saying that Partch&apos;s music might be Just<br/>according to his _theories_, but you couldn&apos;t _hear_ whether they were Just<br/>or not because he used rapidly decaying inharmonic timbres.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Barbershop vs. playing in octaves<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>Barbershop too is trickier than I thought, since in general, it does not<br/>use a just _scale_ but definitely uses just<br/>harmonies/interval/chords/sonorities. Certainly the harmony is the most<br/>important thing as far as definitions of JI are concerned. But we now have<br/>to work a bit harder to exclude Dan Stearns&apos; &quot;Happy Birthday in octaves&quot;.<br/>Of course &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; here is irrelevant.</p><p>We could either say that playing in octaves is 2-limit JI (and therefore<br/>only trivially JI) or simply say that octaves are so ubiquitous and so<br/>rarely tempered that their presence or otherwise is irrelevant to the<br/>question of whether or not something is JI.</p><p>A problem with the latter is that octaves are needed to fully connect most<br/>JI scales when one looks at them in a non octave-equivalent way.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>Connectedness of scales and chords<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>My proposed def is founded on first defining a JI interval (in harmonic<br/>context) and then saying that the larger constructs of chords, scales and<br/>tunings (but not pieces of music) need only have their pitches connected by<br/>just intervals to qualify as just.</p><p>Carl Lumma, you seem to be saying that this condition is too strong for<br/>scales and too weak for chords. I haven&apos;t seen any convincing examples of<br/>either yet. Maybe I missed them. Wanna try again? I think I&apos;d be more<br/>easily convinced of the latter.</p><p>With scales, if we&apos;re gonna draw a line anywhere, this seems the obvious<br/>place. If a scale fails this test, it means it has at least one remaining<br/>interval that could be brought into just intonation without affecting any<br/>others.</p><p>Note that I don&apos;t say that a piece has to be in a JI scale, to be JI.<br/>That&apos;s only _one_ of the ways it can be in JI.</p><p>--------------------<br/>Multiple definitions<br/>--------------------</p><p>Multiple definitions are fine. But when a definition includes &quot;All rational<br/>is JI&quot;, with or without &quot;provided the designer/composer intended it so&quot;,<br/>the only thing I would hope, is that the consequences of such a definition<br/>be clearly spelled out.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry if folk feel defeated. I don&apos;t want to plant any flags in anyones<br/>heart. If defeated, I&apos;d rather it wasn&apos;t by me personally, but by the<br/>logical consequences of previous definitions.</p><p>I love all you guys. You&apos;ve all taught me so much. In a sense, what I&apos;m<br/>proposing isn&apos;t really &quot;my&quot; definition. I wouldn&apos;t have had a clue about a<br/>definition of JI before I joined this list.</p><p>Even if we don&apos;t come up with a new generally acceptable definition, making<br/>the effort has been a fabulous learning experience.

So if folk object to saying that 12-tET is &quot;Just for some Hammond<br/>&gt;timbres&quot; then lets drop it. My only problem with that is, how do we exclude<br/>&gt;Hammond and other Setharian spectrum scales on a purely audible basis. If<br/>&gt;there&apos;s enough 12-tET partials on the Hammond, doesn&apos;t it _sound_ beatless<br/>&gt;(assuming you switch off the Leslie and any other source of vibrato)?</p><p>Well, let&apos;s see if I can pinpoint what seems to be a very subtle acoustic<br/>effect that distinguishes the two kinds of scales. Beatlessness is one<br/>consequence of both kinds of tunings (small integer ratios with harmonic<br/>timbres and customized scales built to match inharmonic timbres), but there<br/>are other effects of small integer ratio tuning that are audible in certain<br/>musical contexts. With scales that follow the harmonic series, the<br/>reinforcement of the fundamental by the combination tones is I&apos;d guess one<br/>of the major causes of this effect. But I&apos;ve noticed it even in utonal<br/>music like Prent Rodgers&apos; _mino9_. Perhaps even in utonal scales, the<br/>combination tones reinforce other notes of the scale to a degree that is<br/>audible.</p><p>In some contexts this effect can sound like a buzz or drone, as Wendy<br/>Carlos demonstrated in _Secrets of Synthesis_ with high-pitched synthesized<br/>strings in the harmonic scale. Perhaps a similar effect could be achieved<br/>with an inharmonic timbre and an appropriate irrational scale, but the<br/>effect of William Sethares&apos; music that uses inharmonic timbres isn&apos;t quite<br/>the same as JI music. The inharmonic timbres lend a certain &quot;roughness&quot;<br/>that&apos;s distinct from the &quot;roughness&quot; of discordance caused by beats. The<br/>difference between these two kinds of beatless harmonies is vaguely similar<br/>to one that I&apos;ve noticed between sounds produced with the harmonics<br/>perfectly in phase and sounds produced with random phase for each harmonic.<br/>Theoretically we can&apos;t hear phase, but with certain artificial electronic<br/>timbres, synthesized sounds with random phase seem to lack some of the<br/>&quot;hard-edged&quot; purity of the same sounds with all the partials starting in<br/>the same phase.</p><p>This can&apos;t be the whole story either, since I don&apos;t perceive this effect in<br/>(e.g.) most of Harry Partch&apos;s music. But it&apos;s there in Ben Johnston&apos;s<br/>_Suite for Microtonal Piano_, in Terry Riley&apos;s _Shri Camel_, in Wendy<br/>Carlos&apos; pieces that use the harmonic scale, and in much of the JI music of<br/>Tuning List members.</p><p>&gt;--------------<br/>&gt;Partch&apos;s folly<br/>&gt;--------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Partch&apos;s folly sounds like, in some sense, exactly what I am trying to<br/>&gt;avoid.

In some cases it also makes use of tiny melodic intervals,<br/>long glissandos, and other effects that in my perception at least tend to<br/>obscure the just ratios. Certainly, Partch&apos;s music is a tour de force of<br/>interesting and unusual sounds, but I&apos;ve often wondered if it wouldn&apos;t<br/>sound just as good in 41-TET.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=16418 href="#16418">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2000 1:51:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joeseph Pehrson...]<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not getting this.

These are good reasons for a definition<br/>based on &apos;harmonic&apos; timbres, and something like Miller&apos;s conditional<br/>becomes useful.  Such a definition is not exclusive of timbre-specific<br/>ones like I&apos;m expounding (why would you assume otherwise, Paul?), and<br/>you when you say &quot;harmonic&quot;, you may have to specify how much accuracy<br/>will is required of the partials, etc.  You&apos;re liable to wind back up in<br/>timbre-specificsville, if you&apos;re not careful...</p><p>&gt;My proposed def is founded on first defining a JI interval (in harmonic<br/>&gt;context) and then saying that the larger constructs of chords, scales and<br/>&gt;tunings (but not pieces of music) need only have their pitches connected<br/>&gt;by just intervals to qualify as just.</p><p>Exactly how I&apos;m doing things.</p><p>&gt;Carl Lumma, you seem to be saying that this condition is too strong for<br/>&gt;scales and too weak for chords.</p><p>Yes, but that&apos;s just my opinion.

It *wasn&apos;t* the Greeks<br/>and Chinese themselves; it was later Europeans and<br/>Americans.</p><p>While I can&apos;t speak with authority on Chinese music-theory,<br/>I do know a thing or two about ancient Greek treatises...</p><p>The Greeks employed the term _&apos;armonia_ (&quot;harmony&quot;)<br/>to refer to several concepts which many of us (including<br/>you and I) would put under the broad definition of &quot;JI&quot;.<br/>But their idea of &quot;harmony&quot; was far broader than ours<br/>(or at least most of us today, excluding perhaps Denny<br/>Genovese and his followers), and almost always also<br/>included ideas about the &quot;proper&quot; (that is, &quot;just&quot;)<br/>relationships between non-musical objects or events<br/>as well.</p><p>At the same time, it must also be pointed out that the<br/>Greek concept of _&apos;armonia_ very often *did* refer<br/>specifically to mathematical properties... not necessarily<br/>low-integer ratios, but certainly superparticularity<br/>(for newbies: that means that successive string-lengths<br/>of certain pitches in a scale were to be successive<br/>integer proportions).</p><p>But perhaps the most important point to make in regard<br/>to ancient Greek music-theory is that the most influential<br/>one by far was that of Aristoxenus, and his theory<br/>had absolutely *nothing* to do with ratios; it was based<br/>entirely on audible principles.  He sought to create<br/>a unique science of music with a metaphysical basis<br/>that was divorced from cosmology, mathematics, and<br/>other domains which theorists were fond of associating<br/>with music, and which was based instead entirely on<br/>consideration of audible properties at many different<br/>structural levels.</p><p>As I&apos;ve posted before in support of Dave K&apos;s argument,<br/>the etymology of the word &quot;just&quot; must be given a promenint<br/>place in debating the defintion of the term.  It refers<br/>to &quot;correct&quot; intonation, and that correctness is not<br/>to be determined solely by frequency-numbers and such,<br/>but rather by what listeners&apos;s ears *hear* as correct.<br/>(What exactly is meant by &quot;correct&quot; provides much scope<br/>for further debate...)</p><p>It&apos;s important to remember that use of the term &quot;just<br/>intonation&quot; originated in Europe, and did not begin until<br/>European musical practice concerned itself primarily with<br/>triadic *harmony*.</p><p>Intonation was never described as &quot;just&quot; before c.1500,<br/>and this was the period when melodic/contrapuntal considerations<br/>were pre-eminent.  The only exception I&apos;d admit to this<br/>is that the Greeks did indeed mean &quot;correctness of proportion&quot;<br/>in their employment of the term _&apos;armonia_ specifically<br/>as it referred to intonation.</p><p>I realize that much of what I&apos;ve written in this post<br/>may be seen as self-contradictory, but I&apos;m &quot;calling it<br/>as I see it&quot;.

Even taking 1811 as<br/>the earliest date, that&apos;s nearly two centuries of use during<br/>which the meanings could evolve, and certainly there are<br/>many other instances of changing definitions in English<br/>over much shorter periods of time.

They had no reason to include<br/>possibilities of higher limits (indeed, 7 was rare and controversial),<br/>non-harmonic timbres, non-Western use, or any of the other cases that have<br/>arisen in our discussion. Barbour, Apel, and others concerned primarily<br/>with European historical use define JI only as a tuning with pure fifths<br/>and thirds.

I would<br/>submit that this same concept of just as an exact measurement or proportion<br/>was then applied to the monochord to distinguish those tunings from<br/>temperaments.</p><p>Writers from Ramis onward defined JI tunings via the monochord or some<br/>other measurement, though they often justified them both by the simplicity<br/>of the fractions as well as the sound which results.

Or conversely, sonorities that<br/>sound harmonically pure but aren&apos;t based on whole number ratios? Should we<br/>accept uncritically the non-technical definition of a dictionary written in<br/>the period when 5-limit, 12-tone scales with harmonic timbres were assumed<br/>and therefore &quot;harmonically pure&quot; was synonymous with 3/2 and 5/4? Or do we<br/>accept Partch&apos;s and others&apos; extension of the term to higher limits, the<br/>non-West, and the ancient Greeks by giving primacy to the composer&apos;s use of<br/>exactly-proportional relationships (the original meaning of just as a<br/>measurement)? To me the latter is much more useful and consistent with use<br/>by composers in this century, though it does not contradict the use of the<br/>term in earlier times.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

But with its &quot;strongly implied&quot;<br/>it tries to sit on the fence about whether there is a limit to the size of<br/>the numbers or not, perhaps in recognition that it is as much a mistake to<br/>limit the numbers (to less than some particular value) as it is not to<br/>limit them at all. The way out is to go back to the audible property.</p><p>Doty gets close with his &quot;compatible with a given musical purpose&quot;, but<br/>this is too vague. It looks too much like the &quot;intent&quot; idea. i.e. &quot;If it&apos;s<br/>in ratios and I, the composer (decider of musical purpose), intend it to be<br/>just, then it _is_ just, no matter how big the numbers are.&quot; Even if it is<br/>indistinguishable from 12-tET?</p><p>&gt; So if faced with tunings that are based on whole-number ratios but don&apos;t<br/>&gt; sound &quot;harmonically pure&quot; what do we do?</p><p>Remember that a just tuning doesn&apos;t have to have all just intervals. But if<br/>an interval is based on a whole-number ratio but doesn&apos;t sound harmonically<br/>pure (in any harmonic context that the tuning can provide) the answer is<br/>simple. We call it a non-just interval (possibly within a just tuning).</p><p>&gt; Or conversely, sonorities that<br/>&gt; sound harmonically pure but aren&apos;t based on whole number ratios?</p><p>I would call them &quot;just for that particular (inharmonic) timbre&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Should we<br/>&gt; accept uncritically the non-technical definition of a dictionary written in<br/>&gt; the period when 5-limit, 12-tone scales with harmonic timbres were assumed<br/>&gt; and therefore &quot;harmonically pure&quot; was synonymous with 3/2 and 5/4?</p><p>The dictionary wasn&apos;t written in 1811! My copy was written in 1959 and<br/>takes account of changes of meaning over time. Have a look at that web<br/>site, there are an enormous number of people, including specialists in<br/>various fields of the arts and sciences working continually to keep it up<br/>to date. It is simply the case that that definition of &quot;just&quot; has stood the<br/>test of time. If it had been based on ratios it would have needed an extra<br/>entry every few years with a new upper limit on the numbers.</p><p>&gt; Or do we<br/>&gt; accept Partch&apos;s and others&apos; extension of the term to higher limits, the<br/>&gt; non-West, and the ancient Greeks by giving primacy to the composer&apos;s use of<br/>&gt; exactly-proportional relationships (the original meaning of just as a<br/>&gt; measurement)?</p><p>As far as I know, the audible-property definition does not exclude any of<br/>these. Partch&apos;s tunings are audibly just (due to the presence of large<br/>otonalities). Pythagorean is 3-limit just.</p><p>Which non-western did you have in mind, as just by your def but not mine?<br/>Indeed some non-western tunings may only be just for certain inharmonic<br/>timbres and not based on ratios.</p><p>&gt; To me the latter is much more useful and consistent with use<br/>&gt; by composers in this century, though it does not contradict the use of the<br/>&gt; term in earlier times.</p><p>This isn&apos;t where the conflict exists. The conflict is between an<br/>audible-property-based definition that would<br/>(a) include LaMonte Young&apos;s dreamhouse, and at the same time<br/>(b) exclude tunings indistiguishable from 12-tET,<br/>and other definitions which would either include both (all ratios) or<br/>exclude both (small ratios).</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=16509 href="#16509">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/13/2000 7:05:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Bill Alves and Jacky Ligon,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your recent posts in this thread suggest a misunderstanding of what<br/>the<br/>&gt; Oxford English Dictionary project actually is (and has always<br/>been).

I am<br/>happy to retract that, but if it is allowed to stand, I must qualify it by<br/>saying that it is not _accuracy_ of just harmony that it epitomises, but<br/>_quantity_.</p><p>I only proposed +-0.5 cent as a deviation from small whole-number ratios<br/>that (almost?) everyone can agree is still just, despite not actually<br/>corresponding to a small whole-number ratio. I also proposed +-5 cents as a<br/>deviation that (almost?) everyone would find too large to still be<br/>considered just (based on 1/4 comma meantone not being considered just). In<br/>between those limits I expect much disagreement, and as you point out,<br/>major and minor thirds can tolerate greater mistuning than fifths. But<br/>these were only proposed as rough rules-of-thumb say for ratios up to an<br/>a*b complexity of 99 (or 11-odd-limit) as bare dyads.</p><p>&gt; In light of the above challenge, can it truly be shown that<br/>&gt; Barbershop Quartet singing is really the ironclad and unshakeable<br/>&gt; proof we need of the definition of JI? To clarify my point here: If<br/>&gt; indeed a &quot;beatlessness&quot; is perceived in the chords of this music, and<br/>&gt; yet we are saying also that there must be &quot;within +-0.5 cents&quot;<br/>&gt; accuracy for it to truly be considered JI, then which am I to<br/>&gt; understand is correct; an audible quality of beatlessness, or<br/>&gt; the &quot;within +-0.5 cents&quot; rendered accuracy of the performance?</p><p>The audible quality.</p><p>We can forget the +-0.5 cents. The reason I brought it up was that even<br/>folks who say JI is strictly ratios, routinely tolerate _at_least_ +-0.5<br/>cent mistunings, which are not strictly ratios.</p><p>Whatever deviation barbershop competition winners (or merely competitors)<br/>do have (after the initial adaptation period for each chord) could well be<br/>taken as defining the upper limit for what is considered JI (for those<br/>particular chords in that timbre and register).</p><p>&gt; And to illustrate the problem in<br/>&gt; front of us all in pursuance of this topic, when a singer deviates<br/>&gt; &quot;+-5 cents&quot; whilst singing a 3/2 or 2/1 in a harmony, what do you get?<br/>&gt; Beats showering down like raindrops in a hurricane! Although with<br/>&gt; thirds (or other intervals, according to the chord voicing) this<br/>&gt; might be less perceptible.</p><p>Yes indeed. That&apos;s a good point, and serves to remind us that it&apos;s the<br/>perception that matters. The actual number of cents deviation that is<br/>perceptible will depend on many factors.</p><p>&gt; To<br/>&gt; clarify: If certain chord tones are slightly distuned to where there<br/>&gt; is only very slow beating, would we not generally tend to perceive<br/>&gt; this as also being justly intoned? Especially if one were to hear it<br/>&gt; without having first tuned the interval themselves. Would this slight<br/>&gt; phasing make any difference in qualifying a chord as being justly<br/>&gt; intoned?</p><p>It wouldn&apos;t disqualify it for me.</p><p>&gt; To answer your question, in light of the Keenanian/OED definition,<br/>&gt; being an audible quality, likely it would be construed as &quot;true<br/>&gt; JI&quot;.</p><p>Quite correct. If JdL&apos;s vertical tunings deviate from simple ratios by no<br/>more than does barbershop, then I would call it JI. Adaptive-JI is still<br/>JI, but quasi-JI isn&apos;t.

Carl Lumma?) and I certainly couldn&apos;t<br/>tell if<br/>&gt; it contained Just simultaneities or not, due to the previously<br/>mentioned<br/>&gt; rapidly decaying inharmonic timbres and rapid progress. I have<br/>however<br/>&gt; examined some of Partch&apos;s tunings (reproduced from his mathematical<br/>&gt; description of them), and given the freedom to sustain their chords<br/>and use<br/>&gt; harmonic timbres, I am quite prepared to agree that they are just.</p><p>And I think this is the really tricky part for all of us; is that<br/>when we are discussing the mathematical &quot;bare ratio&quot; without<br/>considering the timbres being used, then we are indeed dealing with a<br/>mathematically abstracted analysis of a musical system, which might<br/>look one way on paper, and behave in another when perceived as an<br/>audible quality. Truly challenging, is to agree that inharmonic<br/>timbres are being &quot;justly intoned&quot; or not (more on this later today).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; One might wish to say that some Partch piece is non-just although<br/>it is in<br/>&gt; a just scale (sort of the opposite of Barbershop, which is just but<br/>in a<br/>&gt; non-just scale) but I&apos;m prepared to grudgingly give the benefit of<br/>the<br/>&gt; doubt and allow that such a piece may be called just. At least it<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; particularly sound non-just.</p><p>Again this references the above idea of justly intoning as a &quot;facet<br/>of style&quot;. Surely there is little interesting music written which is<br/>totally beatless - it would likely be a bland sound with out the<br/>needed tensions of complexity. It would be a rather subjective call<br/>in my mind, to attempt to define percentages of justly intoning in<br/>compositional settings, which would qualify one&apos;s style or individual<br/>compositions as JI, and might just be easier to say that JI is a<br/>facet of one&apos;s style.

It works really well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To test the program, I thought I&apos;d try some Barbershop.  For the test,<br/>&gt;I picked a brief excerpt of song by the Happiness Emporium.  This<br/>&gt;group did most of their recordings (including this one, from their<br/>&gt;album &quot;That&apos;s Entertainment!&quot;) back in the 70&apos;s, when Barbershop<br/>&gt;technique wasn&apos;t a shadow of what it is today.  However, they have a<br/>&gt;nice sound, and I thought I&apos;d give them a try.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Using Cool Edit, I extracted the CD audio to 16-bit 44.1 WAV format,<br/>&gt;and mixed it down from stereo to mono.  I then ran it thru<br/>&gt;Spectrogram, fiddling with the settings until I got a clear picture.<br/>&gt;The values used to produce the image full.bmp are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Attenuation = 0<br/>&gt;Palette = CB<br/>&gt;Freq Scale = Log<br/>&gt;FFT Size (points) = 8192<br/>&gt;Freq Resolution (hertz) = 5.4<br/>&gt;Band (hertz) = 10-22050<br/>&gt;Time Scale (ms) = 12<br/>&gt;Spectrum Average (ms) = 1<br/>&gt;Toggle Grid = off<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This example contains a nice C7 chord, and I cropped it with Cool Edit<br/>&gt;and spectrogrized it with the same options as above, except with a time<br/>&gt;scale of 4 miliseconds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then, I opened Notepad with the idea that I&apos;d write down the frequencies<br/>&gt;of the first 9 peaks (starting at the bottom of the graph) in this chord<br/>&gt;that I could get a signal strength of greater than -40 dbs out of.  I<br/>&gt;picked the number 9 arbitrarily.  I started at the bottom because I knew<br/>&gt;that&apos;s where most of the parts would be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I didn&apos;t take the readings from the same time on the graph.  Rather, I<br/>&gt;took each reading at the strongest point in each peak (it happened that<br/>&gt;all of these fell very near each other, in third quarter or so of the<br/>&gt;total time).  The crosshairs have a resolution of 1cps, and I did some<br/>&gt;careful work with the mouse.  If there was a range of frequencies that<br/>&gt;shared the same strength, I took the one closest to the middle of the<br/>&gt;range, taking the higher frequency if the range was odd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;After I had done all that and closed Spectrogram, I turned the text<br/>&gt;file into the chart in up.txt.  I am at a loss to explain the results.<br/>&gt;With the transform limited to a frequency resolution worse than 5 hertz,<br/>&gt;I should not have gotten anywhere as close to JI as I did -- yet a<br/>&gt;coincidence here seems unlikely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It may be noticed that I do not have the Lead part labeled in the up.txt<br/>&gt;chart.  At first I thought that maybe the Baritone was at peak3 and the<br/>&gt;Lead at peak4, with peak2 being 5-3.  However, this would be an unusual<br/>&gt;voicing, and listening reveals that the chord is in standard Barbershop<br/>&gt;voicing -- the Baritone is singing peak2, and the Lead is singing a 5/2<br/>&gt;above the bass.

Naturally, some amount of beating is expected in any real-world<br/>implementation of JI that doesn&apos;t involve digital synthesis, oscillators<br/>tied together mechanically by gear ratios, or the equivalent. But I would<br/>think it&apos;s a goal of JI to minimize beating of consonant intervals. I&apos;ve<br/>taken JI scales and added 3 Hz to every pitch, with the result that the<br/>scale beats at a uniform rate for any given type of interval no matter<br/>where it occurs in the range of the keyboard. Is that JI? Or is 3 Hz per<br/>octave enough beating to put it in the tempered category? I think when the<br/>beating is deliberately introduced, it makes more sense to consider it a<br/>tempered scale, while if the beating is a natural result of trying to<br/>approximate beatless combinations of notes imprecisely, it&apos;s JI.</p><p>Of course, examples like this &quot;JI + n Hz&quot; scale only show that there isn&apos;t<br/>a sharp delineation of the boundaries of JI, which is true of just about<br/>any definition of any word you can think of, outside of mathematics.<br/>Perhaps the definition could read something like &quot;beatless or nearly so&quot;.<br/>Personally, I&apos;d probably add &quot;or as nearly so as possible&quot;, but I&apos;m not<br/>entirely opposed to including &quot;nearly beatless&quot; tuning as JI even if the<br/>beating is intentional. I wouldn&apos;t use the word that way, but I don&apos;t think<br/>it would be too inaccurate.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=16614 href="#16614">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
