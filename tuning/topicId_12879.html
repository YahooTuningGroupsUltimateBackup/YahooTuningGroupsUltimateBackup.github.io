In any event, I recommend that most everyone here take some time out from time to time and read some of the very fine articles that Mr. Gann has posted on his site:</p><p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/</a></p><p>Great perspectives on the music(s) of our time, as well as good insights into some of the music/performance issues in NY (and, hence, East Coast) for those of us to the left of all that.</p><p>One thing that Kyle mentioned to Dan Stearns bears repeating: while it is really swell to have the facilities of <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> at our disposal, it is not always a *slam dunk* to stream the stuff, and for anyone *not* on a cable modem or DSL, welll, I just don&apos;t have the time and patience to download the &quot;best quality&quot; files to listen to at my leisure.</p><p>The point? Well, maybe John Starrett would consider (and John, you&apos;ve already done a HUGE favor for everyone with your pro bono encoding/posting of these musics) compiling the .mp3 files on a CD. Or maybe the individuals would consider doing it themselves, as by now surely everyone knows someone with a CD-RW drive. Just a thought, but never in the recent history of recorded music has it been easier or cheaper to splay out your creativity over a wide area.</p><p>But again, none of this should minimize the effort John S. has done to get the Tuning Punks site up, going, and continuing...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 2:52:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

Let&apos;s see: if the only thing you want people to listen to is beating or non-beating chords, then I suppose &quot;reasonable&quot; quality is just fine. However, some of these pieces are *actual pieces of music*. I find nothing at all out of the ordinary in wanting to hear them in the best light possible.</p><p>And time? Well, I have lots of ways to spend mine. Once again, you might want to think globally -- we&apos;ve had people unsub because of per-minute connections, and you want them to spend hours downloading when a couple of bucks for postage would get a CD with more music on it than you could download in ... a long time? (For the record, I&apos;ve done a couple of mp3 compilations that can fit, easily, five CDs worth of music on one CD of mp3 files...)</p><p>&gt;What is the point of this when so many people have &gt;_writable_  CD-ROMS??

People can get whatever music they want.</p><p>I am not going one way, Joe, I am going many ways. I want the Punks site to remain, I want the individual composers to have their own sites. What I want is what the net should be: pluralistic. I want each person to have access to the stuff, in whatever form is best accessible.

Where, oh where, did I say anything about _commercial_ releases??? I&apos;m just talking about individual people popping a CD-R in the drive and burning it!
