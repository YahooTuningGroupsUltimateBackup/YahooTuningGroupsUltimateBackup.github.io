( i happen to like this inversion )<br/>C D# E+F G A# B+C or like the original<br/>D# E+ F G# A# B+ D#.<br/>these are extremely beautiful scales that i am sure no common practice harmonist would not be happy to have acess to.</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;Message: 9         &gt;   Date: Fri, 08 Apr 2005 17:55:22 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Gene&apos;s Bonehead 31-et notation<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; As i pointed out in my other post this notation has worked fine for &gt;&gt;&gt; those who knew little about theory. &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m writing that page for people who may know a *lot* about theory,<br/>&gt;meaning the theory of the common practice music of the Western<br/>&gt;tradition. People who start from the diatonic scale and work up from<br/>&gt;there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Nothing is more confusing to me is when you have letter names crossing &gt;&gt;&gt; if we are going to talk about the layman, to have c higher than Ds &gt;&gt;&gt; especially in a meantone system just makes it hard to find where your &gt;&gt;&gt; notes are.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They don&apos;t need to find where the notes are, since this has nothing to<br/>&gt;do with keybaords. &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Here we are back invented the wheel<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This wheel has already been invented. It is the old wheel people who<br/>&gt;are not microtonalists are already rolling around on. It strikes me as<br/>&gt;absurd to tell someone interested in using 31-equal to write<br/>&gt;common-practice style music that they now must use some new, goofball<br/>&gt;wheel which will not make any sense to them. Why not simply make use<br/>&gt;of the standard notation which has been around for hundreds of years,<br/>&gt;and *which they already know*?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2005 9:04:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello Gene!<br/>&gt;  If someone was just going to write common practice music possibly<br/>&gt; notating your way would be fine.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s the deal. There seem to be a lot of people online who<br/>write very conservative common practice music, and some of them are<br/>quite good at it. There&apos;s no reason they must be writing their midi<br/>files in 12-equal, and in fact 31 will fit a lot of it much better<br/>when it comes to style.</p></div>
