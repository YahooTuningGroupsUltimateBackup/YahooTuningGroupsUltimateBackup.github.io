Many folks have mentioned that live synths in new music<br/>&gt; performances in New York remain rare.  In San Diego and elsewhere<br/>on  the West Coast they are common, while in San Francisco live<br/>computer  muisc is commonplace during live concerts of new music. (In<br/>SF the  computers generate music in real time in response to<br/>compositional  algorithms controlled by mouse and hand movements of<br/>the composers.)</p><p>Thanks to Brian mclaren for this clarification.  I do believe it&apos;s<br/>true that concerts in New York tend to be *either* acoustic *or*<br/>electronic but not so much mixed, for the most part.  There are<br/>*some* of course, but it really sounds like the West Coast does more<br/>of this.  This is particularly encouraging since the combining of<br/>acoustic instruments and electronic sounds is one of the things that<br/>I happen to be, suddently, VERY interested in....</p><p>&gt;        Joseph Pehrson asked if there&apos;s a way to hear longer<br/>examples of my compositions instead of these brief snippets.<br/>&gt;         Yes. Buy CDs of my music. I have 12 for sale.</p><p>Well, that makes sense (and $ and CENTS for you!) so that&apos;s fine.  I<br/>already have CD #6, but I will be interested in some of the others at<br/>some point.  If a catalogue or description of the CDs could somehow<br/>be forwarded to me, it would be very helpful in my future purchasing.</p><p>Believe it or not, I wrote about buying some of the CDs to<br/>the &quot;IMPOSTER&quot; Brian mclaren on the Alternate Tuning List...<br/>Naturally, it didn&apos;t amount to much that way...</p><p>Curiously enough, the CD that I have enjoyed the VERY MOST is the<br/>mclaren &quot;Introduction to Microtonality...&quot;</p><p>This was curious since I ASSUMED it was elementary, and something<br/>that I would already know...</p><p>WRONG.... BEEP</p><p>It was FILLED with observations I had never heard or thought of.</p><p>Everybody interested in microtonality should get a copy of that CD!</p><p>_______ ______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2001 9:49:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In posting 385, McLaren wrote:</p><p>    &quot;Geroge Zelenz is aboslutely 100% correct when he<br/>    points out that the words I falsely and incorrectly<br/>    attributed to him actually belong to Rick McGowan.&quot;</p><p>Hmmm.  Since my name has come up in connection with this, I just checked to<br/>see what this conversation is all about.  What McLaren wrote, in message 347<br/>was:</p><p>&#x9;&quot;So none of us should be surprised that<br/>&#x9;George Zelenz has now weighed in with his<br/>&#x9;2 cents on the side of obscurantism and<br/>&#x9;superstition.  &quot;I don&apos;t see one whit of<br/>&#x9;differnce between mclaren and the other<br/>&#x9;people...&quot; Zelenz claims.&quot;</p><p>Oh!  Wait a minute.  Excuse me, but that is actually a misquote of my<br/>posting (and taken out of context to boot) so I can&apos;t let it slide by without<br/>comment.</p><p>McLaren, you of all people who do so much finger-pointing about evidence,<br/>etc, in other peoples&apos; postings should make extraordinary effort to get it<br/>right yourself.  I&apos;m sure you usually do.  You yourself, in posting number<br/>347, wrote:</p><p>    &quot;I always provide hard evidence for my claims.&quot;</p><p>Please continue to do so.  It&apos;s one of your hallmarks.  Please especially do<br/>so if you&apos;re going to quote people on this list, where any of us can quickly<br/>look up the posting to verify the quote.  The posting is available on-line,<br/>and before quoting me or George, you could have looked up who wrote what.</p><p>So please allow me to correct the record.  For comparison with your<br/>incorrect paraphrase above, what I wrote in message 324, was precisely this:</p><p>    &quot;I&apos;m sorry to say McLaren comes off<br/>    sounding not a whit better than anyone<br/>    whom he&apos;s railing against.&quot;</p><p>I was referring to a passage, immediately ABOVE that in the same message, in<br/>which I stated:</p><p>    &quot;I&apos;m just a bystander who&apos;s getting really<br/>    tired of long-winded rambling diatribes and<br/>    accusations back and forth... on _ALL_ sides.&quot;</p><p>I was not talking about anyone&apos;s music theories or anti-theories or<br/>superstition or obscurantism at all.  I was not defending anyone&apos;s position.<br/>I was not talking about evidence, or lack of evidence, or even about the<br/>subject of music.  I was talking about your accusative rhetorical tone and<br/>the effusive length of your postings, and the subsequent long, defensive<br/>postings that people apparently feel inclined to make in return.  That&apos;s all.<br/> I was not making a comment on the subjects that were being discussed.  I<br/>was commenting on the tone and volume of the discussion itself, not on the<br/>topic of discussion.</p><p>And this is an example of a long, defensive posting that I feel compelled to<br/>make for having been misquoted as well as misconstrued.  And I would not<br/>have to waste so m uch time making this defense if you weren&apos;t being so<br/>overbearing and aggressive in the rhetorical tone of your postings.</p><p>At any rate, I&apos;m glad to see you apologized to George for putting words in<br/>his mouth.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2001 7:37:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brian,</p><p>I accept your apology.
