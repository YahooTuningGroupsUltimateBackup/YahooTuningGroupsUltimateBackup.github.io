There will<br/>be five sets of music played by the internationally acclaimed keyboard<br/>sextet Piano Circus, featuring music by Regimentas Petronis, Steve Reich,<br/>Lawrence Ball (myself), Patrick Nunn, Martyn Harry, Conlon Nancarrow, Terry<br/>Riley, Erki Sven-Tuur and Jean Catoire.</p><p>The Round Chapel, 1d Glenarm Rd., London E5           3PM - 11PM<br/>admission &pound;12 concessions &pound;8<br/>Refreshments and food will be available throughout this event.</p><p>The music will be presented with a projected series of moving colour<br/>sequences generated live by computer software developed by myself and<br/>VR-researcher Dave Snowdon, based on Harmonic Mathematics, a development and<br/>further evolution of John Whitney&apos;s Differential Dynamics, which was worked<br/>on by quantum chemist/physicist Michael Tusch and myself when I was his<br/>A-level (age 17-19 for you Americans) private maths tutor in the mid 80s.</p><p>This form of graphics generation utilises harmonics not as sounds<br/>necessarily, but harmonics of speed of movement (different elements of an<br/>image moving at different, harmonically related speeds - harmonics from 1 to<br/>hundreds) or latterly, harmonics of speed of transition through a look up<br/>table holding a &quot;timbre&quot;, i.e. speed of movement through a sequence of<br/>smoothly connected positions. The result can be outrageously satisfying to<br/>watch, perhaps what a creature who could perceive time very slowly indeed<br/>would experience on hearing a perfectly tuned chord, (if they could see air<br/>pressure waves).</p><p>I wrote some references about Harmonic Mathematics which are in the archives<br/>of the<br/>Algorithmic Composition group &apos;Algo-Comp&apos; (its an egroup- I think they&apos;re in<br/>digests 10 and 13), in summer 1999, for those who wish to know more.</p><p>The performance will also be interspersed by performances by David Stevens<br/>who uses home made sound sources and samples, processes, circulates and<br/>otherwise leavens those sounds.</p><p>The event is the final climax of the Planet Tree Music Festival 2000 (the<br/>4th so far) which I direct in London.<br/> <a href="http://www.planettree.org">www.planettree.org</a></p><p>If there are any tuning folk attending any of the events do come and say<br/>hello.</p><p>many good wishes to all,</p><p>Lawrence Ball</p></div>
