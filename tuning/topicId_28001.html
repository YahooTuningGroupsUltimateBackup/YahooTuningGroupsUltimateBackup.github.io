Religious songs.</p><p>Bob wrote me off-list to point out that many people associate the phrase<br/>&quot;religious songs&quot; with modern gospel music.  To avoid confusion, let me<br/>clarify that Cantus Angelicus performs sacred works of past masters,<br/>including a number of 19th century composers, along with works from many<br/>centuries before, but not including gospel music of the 20th century.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=28070 href="#28070">ðŸ”—</a>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>9/11/2001 9:05:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, John, both for<br/>your patronage and your lovely review! Enjoy! I certainly do it for<br/>the joy and musical fulfillment it brings to me, our members, and our<br/>audiences, both live and recorded. We hope everyone will visit</p><p><a href="http://www.cangelic.org">http://www.cangelic.org</a></p><p>and listen to the streaming audio as well as read about our<br/>performances at an international choral festival near Vienna last<br/>June.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Bob<br/><a href="http://www.cangelic.org">http://www.cangelic.org</a></p><p>P.S.  Within minutes of your posting, we already had orders coming in<br/>from the tuning list. The second CD release is unfortunately not yet<br/>available through our site, but can be ordered directly from me at<br/><a href="mailto:rwendell@cangelic.org">rwendell@cangelic.org</a>.</p><p>Since in this case there is no one in the middle, we just charge the<br/>local rate of $15 per CD and eat the shipping costs. We&apos;re non-<br/>profit, so there is no tax. We cannot process credit cards for the<br/>2nd CD till it&apos;s posted on the site, so we will just accept personal<br/>checks made out to CACS. If you are sending a check for both CDs or<br/>just the second release, please indicate in the &quot;For&quot; line whether<br/>it&apos;s for Vol II or both Vol. I &amp; II.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I have just had the intense pleasure of listening to the two CD&apos;s<br/>&gt; released by the group Cantus Angelicus, under the direction of list<br/>&gt; member Bob Wendell.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A mixed choir of between 16 and 18 members, Cantus Angelicus is<br/>drawn<br/>&gt; from the citizenry of Fairfield, Iowa, population 10,000.
