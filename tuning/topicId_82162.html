A &quot;constant exponential rate&quot;?</p><p>In general, the beating of meantone chords isn&apos;t coherent. There are some special cases where it is -- the standard example being root position triads in metameantone (roughly LucyTuning).  Meantones do tend to sound good the closer they approximate the harmonic series.</p><p>Phi timbres with phi tuning are another way of getting the beats to align with the timbre, as O&apos;Connell explained.  The fact that his has been known for decades without making waves in the musical world suggests it isn&apos;t that important.</p><p>&gt;    So what&apos;s more important, consistence in beating as an abstract concept or following the harmonic series (which has &quot;tonal&quot; consistent beating rate as a side effect)...or are they of equal importance?</p><p>It&apos;s up to you to decide.  Try comparing irrational temperaments with &quot;Mt Meru&quot; scales.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div>
