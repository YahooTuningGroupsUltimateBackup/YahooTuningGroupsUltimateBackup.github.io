I myself look forward to exploring the new scales.</p><p>But I think we need to stop the bus here and think through the prospect of standardisation. I&apos;ve<br/>pondered long and hard on the question of standardisation. In one of my first posts to the list I<br/>expressed an interest in current thinking on the topic. The impression I formed from the replies I<br/>received  is as follows:-</p><p>a. Various ETs have been mooted, 31 being a favourite choice of some.</p><p>b. The idea is passe as the symphony orchestra is pretty much dead, particularly in NY, and I take<br/>that to mean the East Coast.</p><p>I was referred to Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos;s work on new orchestral instruments which I admit is well<br/>researched and interesting. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s a nice chap but where is he? He&apos;s not on this list which<br/>I would have thought a must given the level of debate here. I emailed his organisation ages ago as<br/>an interested party - no reply. Feels like a jobs-for-the-boys-sort of a deal what with all the<br/>proposed funding.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at the real world of music. For centuries people have formed choirs and sung beautiful<br/>music. 12 tet in the a cappella rehearsal is merely a convenient form of notation, giving the<br/>singers useful psychoacoustically valid stopping points on the infinite continuum.  In the UK one<br/>of the biggest real, practical music making events is the local or church choir. Music is made<br/>almost daily and sung with passion and respect. This will continue till the sun burns out. I<br/>imagine that many in the US and European mainland like to sing too.</p><p>Let&apos;s take the 72 standardisation a bit further. We have a new orchestra and well trained players.<br/>But no choirs able to join in the fun. Yes, I know we have the Boston ear training (recognition)<br/>method but I&apos;m unaware of any method aimed at singers producing the tones of 72 tet. We&apos;d better<br/>get a move on with this because one of the best choirs in the world, the Hilliards, in the US I<br/>believe, are about able to deal with drift, Pythagorean substitutions for thirds and sixths and<br/>have exquisite intonation. I would say it would take them at least ten years to master 72 tet.<br/>Please prove me wrong. Perhaps we should fly the idea past them for their opinion.</p><p>And why do we need choirs? Well look at this list: Bach, Handel, Mozart, (etc.), Stravinsky,<br/>Tavener, Monteith (: - ).  All write for voice and instruments. If the instruments move into a<br/>realm that the choirs can&apos;t reach we lose one of our greatest traditions. (Opera doesn&apos;t count BTW<br/>- it&apos;s free to go).</p><p>So, finally getting to the point, we can&apos;t let the tail wag the dog. Any standard has to be<br/>singable. I can see a partial solution to our hypothetical new order. Choir sings in 12. Composer<br/>carefully orchestrates the harmony so that orchestra fits in. Orchestra gets all the fancy bits in<br/>72. Choir becomes little more than a triangle. Nae chance.</p><p>And anyway I have changed my mind (fanfare). Give me one good reason why we should standardise to<br/>another ET?  I like to think of microtonality as a chance to break out of the mould. I also find<br/>the cottage industry approach appealing - many artisans working their own vision within a common<br/>ground.</p><p>Here endeth today&apos;s rant.</p><p>Regards</p></div><h3>ploo@mindspring.com</h3><span>5/30/2001 12:31:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison,</p><p>I agree in whole.</p><p>Well said.

Let&apos;s look<br/>at the reality though. Gerald Eskelin reported that about 2/3 of the<br/>professional choirs he had heard were using _high_ major thirds<br/>(wider than 12-tET) with less than 1/3 shading in the opposite<br/>direction. Since so much of the fine-intonation done since 1800 off<br/>standard notation is _opposite_ the goal of JI -- that is, the fine-<br/>intonation tends to be in a _Pythagorean_ direction -- the JI<br/>composers out there (Lou Harrison, for example) would be served very<br/>well if your average professional choir knew how to read and sing 72-<br/>tET notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s take the 72 standardisation a bit further.

You<br/>should have heard the beautiful young woman (her name is Judith)<br/>singing with Joe Maneri at the Microthon. She clearly could sing any<br/>of the 72 pitches on command, with no uncertainty. I&apos;ve seen her<br/>around Boston -- she comes up every weekend to study with Joe.</p><p>Plus, I&apos;ve discussed how 72-tET ear training (and singing) is<br/>essentially the same as JI ear training from a 12-tET base.</p><p>&gt; We&apos;d better<br/>&gt; get a move on with this because one of the best choirs in the<br/>world, the Hilliards, in the US I<br/>&gt; believe, are about able to deal with drift, Pythagorean<br/>substitutions for thirds and sixths and<br/>&gt; have exquisite intonation.</p><p>As you probably know, I just went to see them. They&apos;re not Americans.</p><p>&gt; I would say it would take them at least ten years to master 72 tet.</p><p>Jon Wild was reporting on this list that they were quite able, in his<br/>piece, to sing distinctions of a diesis in a strict-JI context, which<br/>is of course something 72 represents very well. If they understand<br/>JI, they&apos;ll have a very easy time understanding 72. But they sing so<br/>much early music that it&apos;s probably a bad example.</p><p>&gt; Please prove me wrong. Perhaps we should fly the idea past them for<br/>their opinion.</p><p>Sure, but remember -- 72 _will not work_ for most early music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And anyway I have changed my mind (fanfare). Give me one good<br/>reason why we should standardise to<br/>&gt; another ET?</p><p>I&apos;m just saying one new tuning is better than no new tunings. Right<br/>now, most academic institutions scoff at microtonality. I&apos;m sure many<br/>others can testify. If a whole bunch of composers and theorists from<br/>across the spectrum of new music got together and said, &quot;Look, if we<br/>merely introduced these few new accidentals into the set of notation<br/>that performers were trained to recognize and produce, we&apos;d have a<br/>vast new-music repertoire available to each local performing<br/>establishment&quot;.

I also find<br/>&gt; the cottage industry approach appealing - many artisans working<br/>their own vision within a common<br/>&gt; ground.</p><p>That&apos;s going to continue to be my approach -- playing my own 22-tET<br/>and 31-tET music. I&apos;m simply talking about getting performing<br/>institutions into the act, into a segment of our culture where<br/>microtonality has a pretty steep uphill battle.</p><p>Wow, it&apos;s amazing how many people misunderstood me (well, I was too<br/>rushed to really explain myself yesterday) . . .</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2001 2:37:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul E wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;just don&apos;t mess up any early music with it . . .</p><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;What???!!!

Who is she?</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Of course, if you simply mean,<br/>&gt;&gt;the sliver of the musical universe which falls well under the 72-tET<br/>&gt;&gt;umbrella, it makes more sense.  But it&apos;s important to remember, that<br/>&gt;&gt;is no more than a _sliver_ of the musical universe.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;It&apos;s a hell of a lot thicker than the 12-tET or perhaps 24-tET sliver<br/>&gt;most contemporary performing ensembles are stuck in. It would include</p><p>&gt;1) Most strict-JI music through the 11-limit and possibly through the<br/>&gt;17-limit . . . this includes the Indian shrutis.</p><p>&gt;2) Most Arabic music (currently rendered in 24-tET).</p><p>&gt;3) Most Persian music (which fits 36-tET very well).\</p><p>&gt;4) Nearly everything by Wychnegrasky, Xenakis, Haba, Sims, Maneri,<br/>&gt;Partch, Tenney . . . it&apos;s hard to think of a significant microtonal<br/>&gt;composer in the &quot;classical&quot; world whose work would be misrepresented<br/>&gt;in 72-tET.</p><p>Uh-huh.  And this music and these people may or may not point to the<br/>music of the future; again my guess is, not.  And, sure 72-tET is better<br/>than 12-tET or 24-tET, but to me that&apos;s not setting the bar very high.<br/>Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or let it drift?</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;That might be a useful expressionistic effect.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;composers who want to subvert or parody common-practice style . . .<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I frankly don&apos;t think we&apos;re going to get any more Bachs or Mozarts.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t agree.

If you want to apply<br/>restrictions, there will be no end to them.  I think there is a wealth<br/>of wonderful music written in the 20th century that would be sensitive<br/>to a comma pump, and therefore unsuitable for 72-tET.  For starters,<br/>how about leaving 20th century &quot;classical&quot; music behind (where, IMHO<br/>most of it belongs) and thinking about popular music?  Paul McCartney,<br/>for example.  Or Paul Simon.  Or Michael Johnson.  All very subjective,<br/>but my guess is that these will prove to influence future music of all<br/>genres much more than the stuff that 72-tET serves well.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Drift, IMHO, has a viscerally negative quality about it for many or<br/>&gt;&gt;most people.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;I agree.

Let&apos;s look<br/>&gt; at the reality though. Gerald Eskelin reported that about 2/3 of the<br/>&gt; professional choirs he had heard were using _high_ major thirds<br/>&gt; (wider than 12-tET) with less than 1/3 shading in the opposite<br/>&gt; direction. Since so much of the fine-intonation done since 1800 off<br/>&gt; standard notation is _opposite_ the goal of JI -- that is, the fine-<br/>&gt; intonation tends to be in a _Pythagorean_ direction -- the JI<br/>&gt; composers out there (Lou Harrison, for example) would be served very<br/>&gt; well if your average professional choir knew how to read and sing 72-<br/>&gt; tET notation.</p><p>Yes, but my point is that for the foreseeable future singers are not going to be able to sing 72<br/>tet. I could envisage reading the notation and I could envisage with much practice, being able to<br/>split the semitone into three against a strong pedal. Top pros could perhaps split it into six.<br/>But thet&apos;s a long shot off skipping from, say,  tone 1 to tone 53 at will, or even harder, from<br/>tone 1 plus x to tone y. Even then we are miles from modulating music where our tonic changes with<br/>the harmony.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s take the 72 standardisation a bit further. We have a new<br/>&gt; orchestra and well trained players.<br/>&gt; &gt; But no choirs able to join in the fun. Yes, I know we have the<br/>&gt; Boston ear training (recognition)<br/>&gt; &gt; method but I&apos;m unaware of any method aimed at singers producing the<br/>&gt; tones of 72 tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, those ear training classes are _singing_ classes too. You<br/>&gt; should have heard the beautiful young woman (her name is Judith)<br/>&gt; singing with Joe Maneri at the Microthon. She clearly could sing any<br/>&gt; of the 72 pitches on command, with no uncertainty. I&apos;ve seen her<br/>&gt; around Boston -- she comes up every weekend to study with Joe.</p><p>Mmmm - one rose doth not a garden make. If I grant you the soloist, you would surely concede that<br/>the thickness of a choral texture would mask such small intervals, undermining the composer&apos;s<br/>resources even more.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Plus, I&apos;ve discussed how 72-tET ear training (and singing) is<br/>&gt; essentially the same as JI ear training from a 12-tET base.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We&apos;d better<br/>&gt; &gt; get a move on with this because one of the best choirs in the<br/>&gt; world, the Hilliards, in the US I<br/>&gt; &gt; believe, are about able to deal with drift, Pythagorean<br/>&gt; substitutions for thirds and sixths and<br/>&gt; &gt; have exquisite intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you probably know, I just went to see them. They&apos;re not Americans.</p><p>I know, I heard them perform Machaut&apos;s Messe de Notre Dame at Edinburgh last year and I have most<br/>of their releases.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would say it would take them at least ten years to master 72 tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon Wild was reporting on this list that they were quite able, in his<br/>&gt; piece, to sing distinctions of a diesis in a strict-JI context, which<br/>&gt; is of course something 72 represents very well. If they understand<br/>&gt; JI, they&apos;ll have a very easy time understanding 72. But they sing so<br/>&gt; much early music that it&apos;s probably a bad example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Please prove me wrong. Perhaps we should fly the idea past them for<br/>&gt; their opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, but remember -- 72 _will not work_ for most early music.</p><p>The Hilliards could sing anything from any repertoire with consummate ease, believe me.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And anyway I have changed my mind (fanfare).

What I disagree with is the importance of academic<br/>institutions and our perceived need to have their blessing. Your compatriot Morton Feldman wrote<br/>of this most eloquently.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I like to think of microtonality as a chance to break out of the<br/>&gt; mould. I also find<br/>&gt; &gt; the cottage industry approach appealing - many artisans working<br/>&gt; their own vision within a common<br/>&gt; &gt; ground.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s going to continue to be my approach -- playing my own 22-tET<br/>&gt; and 31-tET music. I&apos;m simply talking about getting performing<br/>&gt; institutions into the act, into a segment of our culture where<br/>&gt; microtonality has a pretty steep uphill battle.</p><p>Quality composition has to be the starting point. I&apos;m not wanting to McLarenise here but let&apos;s be<br/>patient and wait till we have even just a few compositions of quality in 72 tet before we talk of<br/>standardisation. As I think that acoustic music is likely to be more persuasive there will have to<br/>be a lot of retraining and/or new instrument building. I hope to do my bit for the latter. Over<br/>this side of the Great Pond, I&apos;m hoping that Robert Walker and I can get together this summer in<br/>the beautiful Scottish Borders to plan our UK microtonal campaign.

I got an A+ for it because I was able<br/>to sneak in several modern-sounding harmonies that followed the<br/>Bachian &quot;rules&quot; so strictly that she had to concede I had<br/>accomplished the task she set out for us and she simply couldn&apos;t<br/>justify making me change them.  So she recognized the cleverness<br/>of what I had acheived and rewarded me appropriately.</p><p>(My favorite &quot;modern&quot; touches: the unexpected resolution onto<br/>a passing major-7th chord at 0:08; the nice late-romantic-sounding<br/>&quot;minor 6th&quot; chord at 0:47; the neapolitan move I made into a<br/>very unrelated key over the pedal-point (drone) in part 2<br/>of the middle section, at 1:40; and the odd modulation back to<br/>the tonic, still over the same drone, at 1:46.  I&apos;m also fond<br/>of the way the drone is syncopated from the 3rd beat of one bar<br/>to the 2 beat of the next all the way thru the entire middle<br/>section.  Note also that the middle section changes mode from<br/>major to minor, but otherwise the opening thematic motive is<br/>the same as that in the main section.)</p><p>I asked John to retune this in various different ways, and<br/>the one I chose to put on my website is an adaptive tuning<br/>grounded to a COFT which renders very good approximations to<br/>7-limit JI vertical sonorities, and is stretched towards the<br/>high and low ends of the range as in my Rhodes piano stretch<br/>tuning chart:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/monz/rhodes.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/monz/rhodes.jpg</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 2:31:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., George Zelenz &lt;ploo@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24115">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24115</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Satie Definitely!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; GZ<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not quite so certain that Satie follows &quot;common practice&quot; harmony<br/>&gt; that much more than, let&apos;s say Debussy or Ravel...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s certainly much more &quot;static&quot; in his ideosyncratic way...

You know how I feel about directly perceiving ratios as complex<br/>&gt; as 81:64! What happened to my beautiful argument? If you can directly<br/>&gt; perceive 81:64, then why not 81:80? But no, ratios of 81 are far too<br/>&gt; complex to perceive directly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I don&apos;t think you can perceive 27:16 directly. It&apos;s too complex.<br/>&gt; But what about meantone?<br/>&gt;</p><p>But Paul, I was very careful here to speak only of<br/>*intervals* and not pitches, and we&apos;re talking about<br/>a triadic harmony illustration, not individual dyads!</p><p>I agree with you that 81:64, and possibly (but here<br/>I&apos;m not as sure) 27:16, are too complex to be perceived<br/>as those mathematical ratios *when the testing context<br/>is dyadic*.</p><p>But in a triadic harmonic context, I&apos;m very confident in<br/>making the claim that a perceptive listener could perceive<br/>these Pythagorean intervals as the implied harmonic basis<br/>of a progression *actually tuned to 12-EDO*.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;m arguing that 12-EDO&apos;s greater closeness to<br/>Pythagorean than to 5-limit JI would *encourage* that<br/>type of perception.  And my argument is centered on the<br/>fact that *all* of the intervals in the 12-EDO matrix<br/>are closer to Pythagorean ratios than to any with 5^1<br/>or 5^-1 as factors.</p><p>You don&apos;t agree with this?

And then the amazement as, with<br/>&gt; familiarity and repetition, the distance between them seemed to<br/>&gt; almost palpably widen, until the steps felt as big as any 12tET 1/2<br/>&gt; steps!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure most people here have had this kind of experience, yourself<br/>&gt; probably on many occasions, but while the 72 steps may be smaller in<br/>&gt; general, I wonder if it just might be possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then again, it was unison singing, no counterpoint, etc. Opened my<br/>&gt; eyes, that&apos;s for sure; nonetheless, a lot of work to get to that<br/>&gt; point...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think I should have said from the outset that I would LOVE for choral 72 singing to happen.<br/>Thanks Jon for empowering this. Perhaps I should work in that direction too and who knows? I think<br/>though that it is a bit premature for some of us to be calling for a standard without anything<br/>resembling a repertoire to back it up. I do, however, respect the enthusiasm.</p><p>Most musicians are practical people and would turn up their noses at a few lattices, however well<br/>drawn. I&apos;m a Partchian in the sense that if you want something to happen badly enough you devote<br/>your life to it. So I would like to see those who advocate the 72 standard make sacrifices, maybe<br/>drop out and go underground, build instruments, compose, perform and set up their own institutions<br/>instead of trying to win over existing institutions. Which, believe it or not, is what I&apos;m more or<br/>less doing in the name of Art. And it is deeply satisfying.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div>
