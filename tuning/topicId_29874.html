A nice-sounding 8-tone chord in blackjack<br/>is likely to require you to stretch your fingers out tremendously on<br/>the keyboard, probably farther than physically possible :)</p><p>Now I&apos;d guess, since you mention &quot;&apos;common tone&apos; methods&quot;, that you<br/>were probably trying to play three or more adjacent tetrads at a<br/>time, yes?</p><p>In JI, this would tend to work best if the tetrads were in 3:2<br/>relationships to one another. However, even then you get dissonant<br/>intervals like 21:16 and 64:63 very early in the process. Some people<br/>like these intervals in this kind of context . . . try a 6-note chord<br/>like Bb&lt; F&lt; C&lt; (left hand), G&gt; D&gt; A&gt; (right hand). Notice the very<br/>small &quot;64:63&quot; interval between Bb&lt; and A&gt; -- it can clash more or<br/>less depending on how you voice it. Now complete the two Otonalities<br/>by inserting D[ and A[ (look on the lattice to see what I mean by<br/>that). Play around with voicing, and you have a nice big rich &quot;JI&quot; 8-<br/>tone chord.</p><p>Now since we&apos;re not quite in JI, we should take advantage of certain<br/>unison vectors, like the 225:224. You see, a lot of intervals on the<br/>lattice that would be &quot;dissonant&quot; in JI become &quot;consonant&quot; because of<br/>this. If you look at your own &quot;Tuning Lab&quot; page, you can see this<br/>happening in some of the chords (search the page for 225:224). One<br/>example is something I called the &quot;magic chord&quot; a while ago. In<br/>Blackjack you can find it at Db^ F G Bv. Note that in order to see<br/>all the consonant intervals in this chord (and I&apos;m counting 9:8 as<br/>consonant for this exercise), you have to locate at least one of the<br/>notes in more than one place in the lattice. For example, you could<br/>go from Db^ east-northeast to F, east to G, and northeast to Bv, but<br/>you wouldn&apos;t see that Bv is consonant with the starting point Db^<br/>unless you continued south-southwest from Bv to _another_ Db^.<br/>Grouping together more notes in the vicinity, and voicing carefully,<br/>a chord like Db^ F Ab^ G Bv Ev C might prove interesting to you, as<br/>well as similar chords elsewhere on the lattice. 225:224 even helps<br/>you if you try to produce some nice big 5-prime-limit chords, like<br/>say the Ramos-inspired Eb&lt; Bb&lt; F&lt; C&lt; D[ A[ E[ B[ or D[ A[ E[ B[ C&gt; G&gt;<br/>D&gt; A&gt;, since each of the three 45:32s is approximating 7:5 very well.</p><p>But perhaps what you really desire are 15-limit Otonalities --<br/>8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 chords. Then Blackjack is probably not your<br/>answer, though 72-tET can still serve you well -- if you used a 5/72-<br/>oct. generator instead of a 7/72-oct. generator, then a 43-tone MOS<br/>would give you (approximations to) four 8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 chords<br/>and four 8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 chords -- though 43 is more than twice<br/>as many notes as Blackjack!</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2001 3:05:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt; if you used a 5/72-<br/>&gt; oct. generator instead of a 7/72-oct. generator, then a 43-tone MOS<br/>&gt; would give you (approximations to) four 8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15<br/>chords<br/>&gt; and four 8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 chords</p><p>Oops -- the latter line should have read</p><p>&quot;and four 1/(8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15) chords&quot;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2001 6:07:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph.

There are some who speak quite negatively of the<br/>Helmholtz-Partch school, and just intonation recognition in general.<br/>One of the most vocal is composer Brian McLaren (who is a little<br/>eccentric... we call him the &quot;nutty professor&quot;).  His book<br/>_Introduction to Microtonality_ is a valuable read, although not<br/>professionally edited.  It offers a differing view of a lot of this<br/>from the psychoacoustic perspective.  However, it really is for<br/>people already exposed to the field, and not the total newbie, in<br/>*my* opinion.  Brian McLaren can be found on the somewhat<br/>appropriately named &quot;Crazy Music&quot; list:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/messages">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/messages</a></p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Alex Carpenter &#x3C;acarp@altavista.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/2001 8:25:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph wrote:</p><p>&gt; There are some who speak quite negatively of the<br/>&gt; Helmholtz-Partch school, and just intonation recognition in<br/>&gt; general.<br/>&gt; One of the most vocal is composer Brian McLaren (who is a little<br/>&gt; eccentric... we call him the &quot;nutty professor&quot;).</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve heard of the infamous McLaren.

I was pulling Gene up on his (roughly<br/>paraphrased) &quot;it works in practice but not in theory&quot; which I consider to<br/>be bogus.  I&apos;m sure he didn&apos;t really intend it to come out like that, but<br/>his clarification is still somewhat ambiguous.</p><p>&gt; Yes, undoubtedly theory must be born out by practice, and in this<br/>&gt; regard, practical utility is the ultimate criterion for the value of<br/>&gt; any theory and is therefore king. Even so, without the unifying power<br/>&gt; of coherent, comprehensive theory, practice becomes lame.</p><p>I&apos;m with you on the first sentence.  But ISTM that alot of practical<br/>musicians can get by fine with very little theory.  Let&apos;s not give<br/>ourselves delusions of grandeur.</p><p>&gt; The theoretical insight to which Gene refers often leads to renewed<br/>&gt; creativity and important new discoveries. One of the good things<br/>&gt; about this list is that theories get proposed and theories get<br/>&gt; challenged. Also theories that have long been proposed get aired and<br/>&gt; challenged (and illuminated for better or worse). Hopefully only the<br/>&gt; good ones will survive.</p><p>Yes, I expect that&apos;s what he was thinking.  But in the interests of good<br/>theory, it is a mistake to ignore the practical benefits of a diamond<br/>layout.  It&apos;s a theoretical construct that has practical advantages.  So<br/>it must be good theory.</p><p>Erv Wilson&apos;s CPS diagrams are the theoretical advance that builds on the<br/>diamond layout&apos;s advantages.  I don&apos;t think I could have made that step,<br/>but Wilson did and it looks like so much numerology until you consider the<br/>practical benefits.  Once you do understand it, all the theoretical<br/>treatises about the impracticality of just intonation suddenly begin to<br/>resemble a steaming pile of bovine ordure.  Perhaps there&apos;s another<br/>breakthrough around the corner, and we won&apos;t be able to find it if we<br/>can&apos;t see beyond those regular lattices.</p><p>And to drag this thread back on topic, the reason Partch stands as a<br/>towering figure of 20th Century music theory is that he was the one who<br/>showed that high-limit JI could be of practical, musical benefit.  Even if<br/>he didn&apos;t make much use of the JI harmonies, that&apos;s the path he took and<br/>to understand it you could try to read his book.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any &quot;essential reading&quot; about microtonality.  You<br/>could stay on this list and learn from the rest of us who are trying make<br/>sense of it.  But mostly you have to learn for yourself by tuning up some<br/>scales and, if necessary, working out some ideas on a spreadsheet.  Not<br/>enough people have done this and made great music as a result for us to<br/>have a set of key ideas that can be written up and taught to newcomers.<br/>Almost by definition, anything well understood and appreciated isn&apos;t<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot;.  So many good ideas are sitting in journals,  and there are<br/>so many different approaches you&apos;ll have to work out for yourself what you<br/>need to know.</p><p>Still, Partch and Darreg are good places to start.

Even so, without the unifying<br/>power<br/>&gt; of coherent, comprehensive theory, practice becomes lame.</p><p>Graham replied:<br/>I&apos;m with you on the first sentence.  But ISTM that alot of practical<br/>musicians can get by fine with very little theory.  Let&apos;s not give<br/>ourselves delusions of grandeur.</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>Why &quot;delusions of grandeur&quot;? The musicians you refer to are standing<br/>on the shouders of those whose theoretical work laid the practical<br/>foundation and generated the fundamental musical resources for<br/>everything those musicians do. These musical resources, whether they<br/>understand them theoretically or not, are what they manipulate to<br/>produce their music.</p><p>That this manipulation is intuitive detracts nothing from the<br/>value of the theoretical foundations upon which their musical<br/>resources are based. Without these pre-existent resources and no<br/>theoretical understanding of their own, they could do little. Don&apos;t<br/>forget that the understanding of generations of musicians is embodied<br/>in many of our instruments, most especially those well-adapted to<br/>microtonal performance.</p><p>Finally, to say that practice without theory becomes lame (or<br/>perhapes better, blind) DOES NOT HAVE TO IMPLY that any particular<br/>musician must understand theory in order to practice or even to<br/>astound. So why take this as if it were the only possible<br/>interpretation? On the contrary, theory is by nature global and<br/>practice, local. So it runs counter to the very nature of theoretical<br/>discussion to interpret such a statement about theoretical<br/>understanding as necessarily applying to individual practitioners.</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>11/23/2001 9:48:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So he asks about _essential_ reading about &quot;microtonal music&quot;,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; you choose to send him to Math and Music, with the above<br/>breakdown<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; subjects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s an idea.

I don&apos;t know how Wilson draws them, I know<br/>&gt; nothing of D&apos;Alessandro, and I don&apos;t see what any of it has to do<br/>&gt; with Canasta. Of course any comma induces an equivalency on a<br/>&gt; lattice, which includes the commas of miracle.</p><p>D&apos;Alessandro is the 3.5.7.9.11 Euler genus with some notes added to fill a<br/>meantone keyboard designed for 31 notes plus some duplicates.  It means the<br/>keyboard functions melodically like meantone, but it&apos;s all JI.  There are two<br/>problems with converting it to Canasta.  Firstly, pairs like 3 and 11.5.7<br/>can&apos;t both be represented because 385:384 is tempered out.  Secondly, it<br/>overspills the 41 note MOS instead of the 31 note one.</p><p>The genus was chosen because it contains all the CPSes.  There may be a<br/>similar Miracle-unique scale which also has a lot of CPS subsets.</p><p>You need so many Miracle notes because factors of 27 come up as 3.9.  In<br/>meantone or schismic that&apos;s good, because it encourages modulation by fifths<br/>and fifths are cheap.  In Miracle, they&apos;re 6 Secors, so it pays to be more<br/>frugal with them.  As 9 is already 3.3 you can probably get by without 3.9 as<br/>well, but I don&apos;t have a modifiied CPS that takes account of this.</p><p>If these problems could be worked around, it would lead to a just tuning of a<br/>Miracle keyboard.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; I knew about lattices before I read Schoenberg, if that means<br/>&gt; &gt; anything.</p><p>Gene:<br/>&gt; Did you think them up from something else, or get it somewhere else?<br/>&gt; I got lattices from Schoenberg rather indirectly, passing through a<br/>&gt; stage of the dual tiling of chords, which was related to Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; tonal regions. It would be interesting to know how this business<br/>&gt; evolved, and from where.</p><p>I was working with elementary music theory.  Triads and keys.  I drew a<br/>triangular and square lattice to make the relationships easier.  All part of<br/>fumbling towards the realisation that a 5-limit scale has to be founded on<br/>two basic intervals, but there&apos;s no uniquely privileged pair that does the<br/>job.  At that time, I didn&apos;t see how to diagram the 7-limit in two<br/>dimensions, so switched to numbers for everything.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; Now I&apos;m thinking about the reordered diamond, it&apos;s the same<br/>&gt; principle as<br/>&gt; &gt; my 9-limit lattice &lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/lattice.htm#9limit">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/lattice.htm#9limit</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; where<br/>&gt; &gt; 4:5:6:7:9 is set to increase in pitch from left to right.</p><p>Gene:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve looked at that, and don&apos;t get the point of it either. Maybe I&apos;m<br/>&gt; sunk. :)</p><p>If you take a major third and stretch it a bit, you get 9:7.  But 5:4 and 9:7<br/>aren&apos;t particularly close on the usual 7-limit lattice.  The same with 7:6<br/>and 6:5.  So the 9-limit lattice gives you four different triads where the<br/>third gets higher as the middle note gets higher up the lattice.  9-limit<br/>chords are no more complex than on the 7-limit lattice, but you get some of<br/>the melodic advantages of a generalized keyboard.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2001 4:26:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; I like Partch, but I think harmony plays less of a role in his<br/>&gt; music than one might expect.</p><p>Then it is your expectations, and not the work(s) in question, that<br/>are askew.

This field is not, perceptively, only linear. There exist a planar topological invariance in the auditive field : a complete width order combined with an harmonic preorder which are correlable, strictly by perception, in the begining portion of the Stern-Brocot tree. The Tenny&apos;s distance is simply a complete order idealization of that, but useful in context of lattice having few low primes.</p><p>The harmonic dimension is not an algebraic dimension. Differences of sonance are not composable. The formal algebraic structures of musical modes concern only width differences, but there exist an harmonic order in the space of well-formed tonal structures. I would say that time tends to respect the simplest among them.</p><p>There is a problem with the harmonic entropy approach until date. Rather than to refine a categorical perception model, it tends to reduce all at a sensitive perception model.
