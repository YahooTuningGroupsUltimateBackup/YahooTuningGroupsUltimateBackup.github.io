Usefully, the five external tetrahedra are<br/>thin enough so that the spheres show through them from the other sied, so you can click on the triads for<br/>the inward facing  faces from outside it.</p><p>The red and magenta spheres in mid-air are mid points of faces shown as vacant so that one can see into the centre.</p><p>As before, spheres are coloured according to geometrical position.</p><p>All red ones are at centre of faces of external octahedron, all yellow ones are centres of the inward facing faces of<br/>the tetrahedra (showing through on outside because of thinness of the tetrahedra), and all dark blue ones are at centres<br/>of faces of the central tetrahedron. All cyan ones are mid-points of edges.</p><p>This is view through the octahedron face towards the central tetrahedron, which is the one furthest away in the fourth<br/>spatial dimension. Thus, it is smaller because of 4D distance, and its edges are slightly smaller than those of the<br/>octahedron.</p><p>The other tetrahedra are &quot;squashed&quot; because they are seen tilted in the 4th dimension rather than face on.</p><p>You can also easily see the five octahedral faces of the truncated simplex - the external one of course, and four<br/>stretched out ones, each joining one of the vacant triangles of outer octahedron to one of the triangular faces of the<br/>inner tetrahedron - each of these octahedra has four dark blue faces, one red one, and four vacant faces.</p><p>To make it easier for to generate these perspective views in VRML, made a file for anyone to use:</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/decany/decany_template_av_filled_tetrahedra.txt">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/decany/decany_template_av_filled_tetrahedra.txt</a></p><p>To use this to make a template VRML decany with any relative size of outer octahedron and central tetrahedron, first<br/>save as a .wrl file.</p><p>Now you need to do some search and replace of text:</p><p>Select a value for xx,  - (xx,xx,xx) will be one of vertices of centre tetrahedron, (where octahedron has coords<br/>(1,0,0), (0,1,0),...)</p><p>Here xx = 0.5 is the non perspective view.</p><p>then replace</p><p>(1+2*xx)/3, (1+xx)/3, xx/3, (1+xx)/2,  xx/2, and xx everywhere by appropriate values</p><p>So for instance with the ex. of xx = 0.3, these were replaced by<br/>0.533333, 0.433333, 0.1, 0.65, 0.15, and 0.3.</p><p>(you can&apos;t just replace xx because use of formulae to specify coordinates is not part of VRML spec, so replace the<br/>formulae first, then remaining instances of xx at the end.)</p><p>Result will be the VRML template for the perspective view.</p><p>This method will generate all 3D perspective views through either an octahedral or tetrahedral face of the decany<br/>looking towards the centre.</p><p>Explanation of how to add MIDI clips is as before:</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/decany/decany_template_expo.txt">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/decany/decany_template_expo.txt</a></p><p>So go ahead and use this if anyone else wants to have a go as well (or write program to do so).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
