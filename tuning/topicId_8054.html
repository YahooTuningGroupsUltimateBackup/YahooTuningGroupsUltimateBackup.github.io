So I guess my ear wants to<br/>&gt;hear 12-equal temperament at that point</p><p>Ken, you are quite correct: something strange is going on at this<br/>location, where the program is forming a major third on the &quot;backside&quot;<br/>of a JI augmented triad, 25:32, or 427.37 cents, diminished slightly by<br/>other forces, but still a very poor choice at that location!  I&apos;ve got<br/>to dig deep inside and figure out if it&apos;s an out-and-out bug or just a<br/>problem in weighing the various factors.</p><p>The other anomalies you indicate I still need to locate and see if I<br/>think the program could do better with the factors it considers.</p><p>Thanks for your feedback!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
