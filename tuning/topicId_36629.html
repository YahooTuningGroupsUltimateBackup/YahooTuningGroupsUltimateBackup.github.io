Stewart Macdonald or other guitar makers will try to convince you that you can only have frets sawed into the fretboard, made out of stainless steel.  This is not the case... you can make what are really just hard nodes in a string out of anything.  rip out all the frets, using a soldering iron to lightly heat each one up so it comes out smoother,  fill (or not fill if it&apos;s too toilsome) each slot with epoxy, and sand the top smooth...  Use nails lain across the fretboard, strapped down with rubber bands for something a little more &quot;rocking&quot; than tied on frets... of course this will rip up your hands pretty quickly too... I mean when I fret, tight frets are really best with real guitar-supply fretwire, but broad fretting like 7tet could use steel rods, like the chapman stick, with a slot _routed_ instead of _sawed_... I&apos;ve done this, and it works really really well, better than fretwire, and cheaper...  For something really interesting, &quot;draw&quot; frets on a smoothed fretboard with beads of epoxy (use the long-setting kind, because its harder).  Smooth it out with a piece of sandpaper on a long straight block. But really let it cure first.  Won&apos;t last too long with steel strings, but hey, what lasts too long anyway?</p><p>I&apos;ve always been interested in what could be termed the anarchist way of looking at instruments making, because in turning over the old consumerist model of customizing things (buying spendy stuff from guitar-supply places), you figure out the most economical and often better (because it&apos;s designed especially for alternative tunings, not optimized for 12tet) solution, moving the instrument maker from cottage-industry-chained-to-stewart-mac into true independant builder...</p><p>-p</p></div><h3><a id=36640 href="#36640">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2002 11:52:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>Hey man, it ain&apos;t my job to keep track of these things!
