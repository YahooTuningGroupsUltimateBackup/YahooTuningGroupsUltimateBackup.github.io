Podnos.<br/>&gt; Published/distributed:  Detroit, Mich., Information Coordinators, 1974.<br/>&gt; Physical description:  125 p. illus. 23 cm.<br/>&gt; Series:  Detroit monographs in musicology ; no. 3<br/>&gt; Notes:    Bibliography: p. 107-111.<br/>&gt; Subject(s):  Bagpipe.</p><p>Actually i got his book to Erv</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I first learned of this from you in March 2001 and emailed Ewan<br/>&gt; MacPherson who said he would try to get to read a copy of it. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; guessing he never did find it, or didn&apos;t know what to make of it,<br/>&gt; since I&apos;ve emailed him a few times since, to ask if any progress, and<br/>&gt; have had no reply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I expect Ewan MacPherson&apos;s measurements are quite accurate and<br/>&gt; represent the current fashion.</p><p>Possibly the falling away of some of your more ancient material, no longer requires a tuning to accomidate this material.<br/> As much as i love this scale, (using it on some of my first pump organs), i know when i doesn&apos;t work.<br/> In a large group though i imagine the difference between instruments would make up for what a lone pipe would need to do.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can see an official tuning sheet from the Australian Pipe Band<br/>&gt; college in 1991, on my website at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/AFBPAtuning.gif">http://dkeenan.com/Music/AFBPAtuning.gif</a><br/>&gt; They apparently hadn&apos;t caught up with the fashion for a 7/4 seventh<br/>&gt; and a narrow octave, since it is<br/>&gt; 9/10 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there is apparently no such thing as _THE_ bagpipe tuning. It is<br/>&gt; apparently a somewhat flexible thing.</p><p>I would imagine though that the makers would have and do have the final word on this</p><p>&gt; Most flexible are the third and<br/>&gt; sixth, next the seventh, and also apparently the fourth. Here are what<br/>&gt; would seem to be the upper and lower limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 9/10 1/1 9/8 5/4 27/20 3/2  5/3 9/5 2/1<br/>&gt; 7/8  1/1 9/8 350c 4/3  3/2 850c 7/4 2/1-30c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I love the bagpipes for the fact that, of all instruments used<br/>&gt; commonly in the west, they alone have held out against the 12-equal tide.</p><p>well they are instruments of war and resistance is the name of the game. one advantage of a just scale is that it makes a common ground to incorporate<br/>those great instruments of the aboriginals there. Iresently did a program on my show alternating songs from the whites in the 19th century with those of<br/>these people. ending with some very unconforatble music done by people whose parents come from both traditions.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=47159 href="#47159">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/23/2003 12:00:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 9/23/2003 2:32:22 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; I love the bagpipes for the fact that, of all instruments used<br/>&gt; &gt;commonly in the west, they alone have held out against the 12-equal tide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well they are instruments of war and resistance is the name of the game. one<br/>&gt; advantage of a just scale is that it makes a common ground to incorporate<br/>&gt; those great instruments of the aboriginals there.

The tone holes of the chanter retain their shape<br/>more than any other &quot;wind&quot; instrument because there is no moisture running<br/>through them.  Of course, there is always an oily hand.  But bagpipes are reputed<br/>to hold ancient tunings better than any other instrument, including the organ.</p><p>best, Johnny R</p></div>
