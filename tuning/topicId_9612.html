But, clearly, their are limits, both physical and perceptional,<br/>&gt;on how fine an increment can be discerned.  And, since some intervals are<br/>&gt;indiscernible, it would seem that the _practically_ the lattice is finite.</p><p>&gt;Is it reasonable to superimpose a &quot;discernability grid&quot; or a &quot;precision<br/>&gt;grid&quot;, or some other such grid, on top of the tonal lattice, thereby<br/>&gt;joining like-tones (hmm..., &apos;homotones&apos;?), into a finite, practical<br/>&gt;lattice?</p><p>This is exactly the concept of _finity_ that forms one of Joe Monzo&apos;s main<br/>interests. He&apos;s been kind enough to put lots of material on the subject on<br/>the Web, and will no doubt be adding more once he gets settled in<br/>California. You could start with<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm</a>.</p><p>Also go to <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/pblock.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/pblock.htm</a> and follow the<br/>links from there. When Joe visited me in Boston, he made it a point to ask<br/>me about finity and I mentioned that Fokker&apos;s periodicity block formalism<br/>seemed to get at the same idea. Since then, I&apos;ve looked into the concept<br/>more deeply and posted many articles on it (search the archives for<br/>&quot;periodicity&quot;).</p><p>I&apos;d be happy to help you if any of the material you find is unclear.</p></div><h3><a id=9616 href="#9616">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

No one is saying that 31&cent; or even much smaller intervals can&apos;t<br/>be perceived as structurally distant on the lattice if the composition uses<br/>them that way. At the same time, finity can open up compositional<br/>possibilities absent on the infinite lattice through the use of &quot;punning&quot; --<br/>at which point temperament and/or adaptive tuning become useful options. The<br/>commonest Western progressions rely on &quot;punning&quot; through the syntonic comma,<br/>an interval which in pure just intonation would come out to 21.5&cent;. However,<br/>if one wrote a piece in just intonation in which the melodic interval of<br/>syntonic comma was a motivically emphasized feature, one could<br/>compositionally project it as a significant move in the harmonic lattice.<br/>These are not contradictions, they are merely alternate possibilities in the<br/>vast field of musical composition, and a demonstration that musical context<br/>is everything when dealing with these abstract &quot;lines in the sand&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=9617 href="#9617">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

For a great part the structural &gt;Possibilities is what<br/>attracted him to build instrument in this tuning. As Dan could also point<br/>out , he did not limit &gt;himself to this singular structural perspective.<br/>Many of his composition were based on ideas outside the diamond but &gt;could<br/>be done with a diamond master set.</p><p>If I&apos;m understanding you correctly, Kraig, this is precisely the concept of<br/>finity at work! Partch created a tuning system for his instruments that, as<br/>Wilson helped show, was a 41-tone periodicity block with two auxillaries.<br/>Ideas using pitches in the JI lattice outside this set were simply<br/>&quot;translated&quot; by Partch to within the set, and even without any use of<br/>temperament or adaptive tuning, he essentially had access to the whole<br/>infinite lattice. The set of &quot;unison vectors&quot; or intervals of translation<br/>that results in a periodicity block which corresponds most closely to<br/>Partch&apos;s set seems to be:</p><p>896/891 = 9.7&cent;<br/>441/440 = 3.9&cent;<br/>245/243 = 14.2&cent;<br/>100/99 = 17.4&cent;</p><p>The last interval is so large that Partch kept it in his set between two<br/>sets of auxillaries, 10/9 and 11/10, and 20/11 and 9/5, making it a 43-tone<br/>set in total (another reason for these auxillaries was their presence in the<br/>29-tone diamond that formed the starting point for Partch&apos;s construction).<br/>Due to the properties of periodicity blocks, we can say for certain that any<br/>&quot;translation&quot; Partch may have done to get his ideas into his pitch set was<br/>through one of the intervals above, or less likely a combination of more<br/>than one of them. I would venture a guess that due to Partch&apos;s sensitive<br/>ear, the 3.9&cent; &quot;comma&quot; is the one Partch would have been most likely to make<br/>use of.</p></div>
