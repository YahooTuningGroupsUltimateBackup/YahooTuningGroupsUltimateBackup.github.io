Peppermint was<br/>designed to get 12:13:14 virtually<br/>just, and this is a feature of<br/>my favorite maqam tunings.<br/>There&apos;s lots of history here, from<br/>Ibn Sina to Kathleen Schlesinger<br/>in &quot;Greek-influenced&quot; traditions;<br/>and, if the name dhanvantarisma has<br/>an historical basis, in raga music<br/>also.</p><p>I have heard that 12:13:14 occurs in<br/>certain ragas, and this would have<br/>every bit as much rightful priority<br/>as Ibn Sina -- so there would be no<br/>reason to upset dhanvantarisma. It<br/>might be that dhanvantarisma itself<br/>is indirectly honoring Ibn Sina and<br/>the Persian tradition his writings<br/>reflect, since there is evidence<br/>for a Persian influence on some<br/>Hindustani music.</p><p>For example, there&apos;s a raga Darbari<br/>Kanada at</p><p>1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 14/9 16/9 2/1</p><p>where &quot;Darbari&quot; may refer to a<br/>Persian Court style. I wonder if<br/>the 12:13:14 pattern may occur in<br/>related ragas with a septimal feeling.</p><p>So the question is: is dhanvantarisma<br/>a reference to some traditional raga<br/>music with 12:13:14 or the like where<br/>169/168 is relevant? If so, it should<br/>stand.</p><p>If not, maybe &quot;Ibn Sina&apos;s tredecimal<br/>seconds comma&quot; would best follow scala,<br/>by analogy to &quot;undecimal seconds comma&quot;<br/>for 121/120 (11:10 vs. 12:11).<br/>He is the first writer of which I&apos;m<br/>aware in the Near Eastern tradition<br/>to introduce ratios of 13, e.g.<br/>16:14:13:12; and he notes that some<br/>musicians, in fretting their instruments,<br/>do not seem to distinguish between<br/>14/13 and 13/12.</p><p>In short, the first question is to<br/>clarify what dhanvantarisma means.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105640 href="#105640">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2012 4:41:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, all, and I&apos;d like to comment<br/>&gt; on the 169/168, because this is one<br/>&gt; of my favorite commas to observe:<br/>&gt; Ibn Sina (980-1037) has early dibs,<br/>&gt; for one.</p><p>We&apos;ve already got two commas named after  him.</p></div><h3><a id=105642 href="#105642">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2012 5:01:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone.</p><p>Having written a bit about the 169/168,<br/>I&apos;d like to mention two commas (one<br/>already brought up in a previous article<br/>on the 194481/194480) also connected with<br/>Ibn Sina (980-1037).</p><p>The first, which I mentioned, is the 2080/2079<br/>(0.833 cents), the difference between 14/13<br/>and 320/297, the latter the 32/27 complement<br/>of 11/10. Ibn Sina notes that in 9:8-11:10-320:297,<br/>the nonsuperparticular interval is very close<br/>to 14/13.</p><p>The second might be called the tredecimal kleisma<br/>or the like -- I&apos;m not sure of the best name,<br/>but it&apos;s connected with Ibn Sina -- the 352/351<br/>(4.925 cents).</p><p>For Ibn Sina, what he sometimes the nonsuperparticular<br/>&quot;remainder&quot; interval in a tetrachord (analogous to the<br/>256/243 limma in the ditonic diatonic) may sometimes<br/>approximate a superparticular ratio.</p><p>Thus in al-Farabi&apos;s 9:8-12:11-88:81, Ibn Sina notes<br/>that 88:81 is close to 13:12 -- thus alluding to<br/>the difference, which we know is 352:351.</p><p>Likewise, in his own favored 9:8-13:12-128:117, he<br/>notes that 128:117 is close to 12:11 -- the<br/>difference, as we know, again being 352:351.</p><p>In modern music, 352:351 also is the difference<br/>between 32/27 and the smaller 13:11. Indeed the<br/>11:12:13 or 13:12:11 division might be seen as<br/>a kind of further development of Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>theory, although he doesn&apos;t, at least explicitly,<br/>suggest use of a minor third at 13:11 rather<br/>than the classic 32:27.</p><p>So 169/168, 2080/2079, and 352/351 all come up<br/>in Ibn Sina&apos;s writings and tunings, as well<br/>as tunings of others (and more specifically<br/>al-Farabi) that he mentions and analyzes.<br/>Here are some relevant tunings:</p><p>169/168  16:14:13:12 (14/13, 13/12) 352/351  9:8-13:12-128:117 (12/11, 128/117)<br/>2080/2079 9:8-11:10-320:297 (14/13, 320/297)</p><p>While 2080/2079 might be &quot;Ibn Sina&apos;s 11-13<br/>schismina&quot; or the like, and 169/168 &quot;Ibn<br/>Sina&apos;s tredecimal seconds comma&quot; (maybe a<br/>name to complement dhanvantarisma, as with<br/>Gauss&apos;s comma or the xenisma), the 352/351<br/>might have a dual status: either &quot;Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>undecimal-tredecimal seconds kleisma&quot;<br/>(12/11, 128/117); or also the modern<br/>&quot;tredecimal kleisma&quot; (13/11, 32/27) for<br/>situations where 13/11 is in use.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105656 href="#105656">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2012 6:49:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In other words, these are pretty damn important commas, especially when<br/>&gt; they&apos;re also of a low prime-limit.

And Happy Holidays!</p><p>After a bit of thought, Gene, I would urge that even though<br/>Ibn Sina may already have two commas named after him -- the<br/>one I&apos;ve found so far in Scala and on Xenwiki is a 7-limit<br/>diesis at 525/512 (43.408 cents) -- his 13-limit comma or<br/>kleisma at 169/168 (10.274 cents), the difference beween<br/>13:12 and 14:13, should take precedence.  One or both of the<br/>others should, if necessary, be renamed. And 169/168 can be<br/>treated like 9801/9800 (either Gauss&apos;s comma or the kalisma),<br/>being named &quot;Ibn Sina&apos;s tredecimal seconds kleisma, or<br/>dhanvantarisma.&quot;</p><p>To cut to the chase, Ibn Sina (980-1037) is the first music<br/>theorist of which I know, at least in the Greek and partly<br/>derivative European and Near Eastern traditions to address<br/>prime 13, and to specify what he terms a &quot;very noble genus&quot;<br/>in the 13-limit with all superparticular steps, and with<br/>remarkably small integers to boot, 16:14:13:12.</p><p>He derives this tetrachord by taking the 8:7:6 division of<br/>the 4/3 fourth by Archytas, and then subdividing 7/6 into<br/>14:13:12.</p><p>   1/1                     8/7                      4/3<br/>    8                       7                        6<br/>    |-----------------------|------------------------|<br/>   16                      14           13          12<br/>   1/1                     8/7        16/13        4/3<br/>    0                     231.2       359.5       498.0<br/>               8:7              14:13       13:12<br/>              231.2             128.3       138.6</p><p>In _Divisions of the Tetrachord_, John Chalmers rightly<br/>lists this 13-limit tetrachord of Ibn Sina as among the<br/>select group with all superparticular ratios. A permutation,<br/>28:26:24:21, is available in the Scala archive as<br/>avicenna_diat.scl.</p><p>Making 169/168 the signature comma of Ibn Sina follows the<br/>same pattern we follow with the comma of Didymus at 81/80<br/>(9/8, 10/9; the comma of Archytas at 64/63 (8/7, 9/8); or<br/>the comma of Ptolemy at 100/99 (10/9, 11/10).</p><p>Here I can see two reasonable solutions:</p><p>      (1) Rename one or both of his two other commas, and<br/>          give him 169/168 as his signature comma. A<br/>          theorist introducing the 13-limit should be known<br/>          for a 13-limit comma rather than something like<br/>          525/512 (7-limit), if there must be a choice.</p><p>      (2) Let him have three commas -- maybe a solution<br/>          contrary to a very sound policy, but a lesser evil<br/>          than not giving him the 169/168.</p><p>With best holiday wishes,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=105679 href="#105679">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2012 1:06:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>And 169/168 can be<br/>&gt; treated like 9801/9800 (either Gauss&apos;s comma or the kalisma),<br/>&gt; being named &quot;Ibn Sina&apos;s tredecimal seconds kleisma, or<br/>&gt; dhanvantarisma.&quot;</p><p>That is much too verbose for a trivial name.

The short story is that this one is for real: the<br/>original tuning of al-Farabi, that is, of which this is<br/>indeed a permutation. As given by Cris Forster at pp. 663 of<br/>_Musical Mathematics_, #3, al-Farabi&apos;s tuning is<br/>7/6-16/15-15/14 or, if I&apos;m correct, 56:48:45:42.</p><p>In the original, the large interval of 7/6 is first, then<br/>16:15 (for 56/45), and finally 15:14 -- or 0-267-379-498.<br/>This could be a modern Turkish Sazkar, I might guess, in a<br/>style where the third of the related Makam Rast is placed<br/>near but a tad below 5/4 -- in theory a schisma lower, but<br/>in practice sometimes a bit more (Ozan Yarman suggested that<br/>382 cents might be a sweet spot, and 56/45 about the lower<br/>limit for this type of Rast).</p><p>However, a permutation like al-farabi_chrom2.scl placing the<br/>large chromatic step in the middle is most characteristic of<br/>maqam/makam music, and is generally known as a Hijaz<br/>tetrachord. By the 13th century, Safi al-DIn al-Urmawi<br/>advises that it is best to try all six permutations of a<br/>tetrachord; and by 1300 or so, Qutb al-Din al-Urmawi defines<br/>another type of chromatic, 12:11-7:6-22:21, as Hijaz. This<br/>has a higher third step; but for musicians who liked a third<br/>near 5/4, something like 112:105:90:84 or 16:15-7:6-15:14<br/>might be quite attractive. In modern terms, it would be seen<br/>as one fine shading of 5-12-5 commas.</p><p>Again, al-Farabi&apos;s chromatic is for real, as is the<br/>permutation as something that people might well have been<br/>doing at various points during that general era, and which<br/>Qutb al-Din confirms that people were doing by around 1300.</p><p>With best New Year&apos;s wishes,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105697 href="#105697">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2012 2:32:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi, Gene.

I stand corrected, of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I&apos;ll make a pre-New Years&apos; resolution to cite this<br/>&gt; definitive example of al-Farabi, as well as your<br/>&gt; interpretation of his Jins 6, whenever I mention Ibn Sina in<br/>&gt; connection with prime 13! Bravo!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Strong Disjunct (Firm) tetrachord, if I&apos;m right, is then<br/>&gt; 572:520:480:429 or 11/10-13/12-160/143 (165.0-138.6-194.468<br/>&gt; cents).</p><p>This is correct.</p><p>&gt; An interesting aside here is that the interval between the<br/>&gt; lowest and third notes of this tetrachord is 143/120, or<br/>&gt; 303.577 cents. As it happens, this is very close to<br/>&gt; al-Farabi&apos;s Persian third finger at 81/68 or 302.865 cents,<br/>&gt; a difference of 2431/2430 or 0.712 cents.</p><p>This is not only correct, but highly insightful.</p><p>&gt; The topic al-Farabi&apos;s Jins 6 also led me to note that his<br/>&gt; Jins 7 as you have interpreted it includes a chromatic step<br/>&gt; of 128/105 or 342.905 cents. This differs from 39/32<br/>&gt; (342.483 cents), an interval which was to become Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt; wusta Zalzal but is also found in your octave species based<br/>&gt; on Jins 6, by a superparticular ratio of 4096/4095 (0.423<br/>&gt; cents), used in the Sagittal notation system, and sometimes<br/>&gt; called the Sagittal schismina.</p><p>Yes, the inversion of 64/39 leads directly to Ibn Sina&apos;s wusta al Zalzal 39/32. Another brilliant observation. Thank you.</p><p>&gt; So not only have you enlightened me on al-Farabi&apos;s explicit<br/>&gt; use of 13/12 and evidence pointing to 16/13 as well, but you<br/>&gt; have led me to a 2431/2430 distinction clearly present<br/>&gt; between his intervals of 143/120 and 81/68, as well as one<br/>&gt; of 4096/4095 between 39/32 and 128/105 in your readings of<br/>&gt; Jins 6 and Jins 7.</p><p>A wonderful summation. And thank you especially also for your implicit endorsement (I don&apos;t want to put words in your mouth) that Al-Farabi&apos;s &quot;parts&quot; or &quot;step&quot; may have a physical presence on his sound-producing &grave;ud strings.</p><p>&gt; My warmest thanks for being set straight, and in a most<br/>&gt; educational way!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Happy Holidays,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo</p><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>I wish you a wonderful New Year and many moments of great insight<br/>for all of us to value and appreciate.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Cris</p></div><h3><a id=105700 href="#105700">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2012 8:40:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m left unclear on the question of whether &quot;al-farabi_chrom2&quot; can reasonably be attributed to Al-Farabi.</p><p>Margo tells us that Safi al-Din al-Urmawi tells us that you should always try all six permutations of a given tetrachord, and I think this is the justification for attributing this scale to Al Farabi. If we marvel temper, the six permutations become three: Tss, sTs and ssT, where T is a subminor third and s is a secor. If we project to the 5-limit, T becomes 75/64, the classic augmented second, and s becomes 16/15. The first permutation, Tss, leads to a 5-limit version of 75/64-5/4-4/3-3/2-225/128-15/8-2. Adjusting by 225/224, this is equivalent to 7/6-5/4-4/3-3/2-7/4-15/8-2, which is inverse to al-farabi and is a mode of al-farabi_g10, and is one of al-Urmawi&apos;s permutations: 7/6, 15/14, 16/15, 9/8, 7/6, 15/14, 16/15. The second permutation sTs, leads to Gypsy. The third permutation, ssT, has a 5-limit version 16/15-256/225-4/3-3/2-8/5-128/75-2, which can be adjusted to 16/15-8/7-4/3-3/2-8/5-12/7-2, which is al-farabi.</p><p>Adding 32/25 to the 5-limit projection of a-farabi leads to a scale which is nicely symmetrical in the 5-limit lattice of pitch classes and which does not seem to correspond to any known scale. Another mode of the same scale can be obtained by adding 25/16 to the 5-limit version of the first permutation, hence both scales can be played within this 8-note scale.</p></div><h3><a id=105701 href="#105701">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2012 2:30:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Are we talking about a permutation of a tetrachord?

While you canvass some of the possibilities<br/>and intonational variations or temperings in your subsequent<br/>posts, I&apos;ll go through all six permutations of the<br/>tetrachord we&apos;re discussing, and also the conjunct and<br/>disjunct octave species from each. So we&apos;ll have 12 octave<br/>species in all.</p><p>Whether all permutations of a given jins (Arab for &quot;genus&quot;)<br/>may rightly be attributed to the person describing it is<br/>another question, with Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s advice to<br/>consider all the permutations as one possible basis for<br/>taking this view. In some cases, however, we may have either<br/>practical knowledge or contextual clues suggesting that a<br/>given theorist or style would _not_ equally value all six<br/>permutations or accept them all as idiomatic. That may be<br/>another discussion, and here I just want to acknowledge that<br/>while all six permutations will be interesting, that doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily mean that all six will be used in practice -- at<br/>least at one given time and place.</p><p>Now to our tetrachord of al-Farabi, 7:6-16:15-15:14 or<br/>56:48:45:42 (1/1-7/6-56/45-4/3), and its permutations and<br/>octave species.</p><p>Original tetrachord (Permutation 0) -- Conjunct</p><p>       lower             upper          9/8<br/> |----------------|-------------------|.....|<br/>1/1  7/6  56/45  4/3   14/9 224/135 16/9  2/1<br/>   7:6 16:15 15:14  7:6  16:15   15:14 9:8</p><p>Original tetrachord (Permutation 0) -- Disjunct</p><p>       lower        9/8         upper<br/> |----------------|.....|----------------|<br/>1/1  7/6  56/45  4/3   3/2   7/4  28/15 2/1<br/>   7:6 16:15 15:14  9:8   7:6  16:15 15:14</p><p>Note that we get this tetrachord by taking 7:6 as the<br/>chromatic interval greater than (4/3)^(1/2), and having a<br/>remainder or fourth&apos;s complement of 8:7, which al-Farabi<br/>divides into two superparticular intervals, 16:15:14. This<br/>form reflects, among other things, both a general preference<br/>for superparticular steps where they are available, and a<br/>tendency to favor arithmetic divisions like 16:15:14 here.<br/>But as we go through the permutations, we&apos;ll encounter<br/>different orderings of these steps.</p><p>I should add that while the _lower_ tetrachord might be a<br/>Turkish Sazkar, in that makam the upper tetrachord would be<br/>Rast, if I am correct. Often in maqam/makam, there&apos;s a<br/>tendency to think of the lower tetrachord as the &quot;root&quot; one,<br/>and mainly definitive of a given &quot;family&quot; -- with the upper<br/>tetrachord more subject to variation without changing the<br/>basic identity of the family. So if I say, &quot;Yes, that&apos;s<br/>al-Farabi,&quot; or &quot;Yes, that&apos;s a permutation of one his<br/>tunings,&quot; I&apos;ll often be focusing on the lower tetrachord.<br/>Clarifying questions like the ones you asked about an octave<br/>species are thus very helpful.</p><p>Permutation 1 -- Conjunct</p><p>       lower             upper          9/8<br/> |----------------|-------------------|.....|<br/>1/1  16/15  8/7  4/3  64/45 32/21   16/9   2/1<br/>  16:15 15:14  7:6 16:15 15:14   7:6    9:8</p><p>Permutation 1 -- Disjunct</p><p>       lower         9/8       upper<br/> |-----------------|.....|----------------|<br/>1/1  16/15  8/7   4/3   3/2  8/5  12/7   2/1<br/>  16:15 15:14  7:6  9:8  16:15 15:14  7:6</p><p>This permutation is like a typical ancient Greek chromatic,<br/>with smallest step first, then middle step, and the large<br/>chromatic step last going up to the 4/3 step of the<br/>tetrachord. Interestingly, the positions with the large<br/>chromatic step as the highest seem least characteristic of<br/>maqam music today, as systematists such as Amine Beyhom have<br/>concluded.

More specifically, the<br/>disjunct form would be Makam Hijazkar. The form with two<br/>conjunct Hijaz tetrachords is sometimes known in the Arab<br/>world as Hijazayn or the like -- a twin or double Hijaz.<br/>While octave species with conjunct tetrachords are often<br/>preferred in medieval theory -- a general comment, not one<br/>relating especially to Hijaz --  both conjunct and disjunct<br/>forms are described (in keeping with Greek theory), and in<br/>modern theory and practice disjunct forms are sometimes the<br/>most common (e.g. modern Rast, Hijazkar).</p><p>So, far, we&apos;ve been doing simple rotation, leaving the<br/>sequence of intervals in 7/6, 16/15, 15/14 alone and simply<br/>changing where we start in the sequence.

A string division for this<br/>tetrachord would be 120:112:105:90. Note that in traditional<br/>theory, the concept of a &quot;harmonic division&quot; is defined in<br/>terms of string lengths, with the first three terms the<br/>relevant ones. In 120:112:105, the difference of the first<br/>two terms is 8, while that of the last two is 7 -- forming a<br/>ratio identical to that between the extreme terms, 120:105,<br/>or 8:7. In some medieval theory (e.g. in Europe), the<br/>harmonic division is seen as especially pleasing; but<br/>arithmetic divisions are very common, and often easier to<br/>find on a monochord or as fret positions.</p><p>Permutation 5 -- Conjunct</p><p>       lower                 upper          9/8<br/> |-----------------|----------------------|.....|<br/>1/1  16/15  56/45 4/3   64/45   224/135 16/9   2/1<br/>  16:15  7:6  15:14 16:15    7:6     16:15  9:8</p><p>Permutation 5 -- Disjunct</p><p>       lower         9/8         upper<br/> |-----------------|.....|------------------|<br/>1/1  16/15  56/45 4/3   3/2   8/5    28/15 2/1<br/>  16:15  7:6  15:14  9:8  16:15   7:6  15:14</p><p>This is the final permutation, and the one shown in<br/>al-farabi_chrom2.scl.

Thus al-farabi_chrom2.scl is a permutation<br/>of his actual tuning as defined in integer ratios.</p><p>As Cris discusses in his book, the interpretation<br/>of al-Farabi&apos;s tunings given in &quot;parts&quot; of a tone<br/>or fourth after the general manner of Cleonides<br/>is more controversial; but a rational<br/>interpretation may be the best alternative.</p><p>Clearly al-Farabi is oriented to a Ptolemaic<br/>perspective favoring integer ratios and<br/>especially superparticular ones as the main<br/>basis for tunings, although, as Cris observes,<br/>he may not be a bit more flexible on using<br/>superpartient (neither multiplex like 2/1 nor<br/>superparticular like 3/2) ratios than Ptolemy.</p><p>Assuming that al-Farabi&apos;s tunings in &quot;parts&quot;<br/>are meant to be implemented, how would one<br/>implement them on a fretted instrument, for<br/>example? Some kind of rational division seems<br/>a likely answer, and arithmetic divisions are<br/>both the easiest to implement, as a general<br/>rule, and the most characteristically used<br/>in explicitly rational tunings, something<br/>that Cris documents in great and admirable<br/>detail.</p><p>But the 7:6-16:15-15:14 tuning is defined<br/>as exactly that, so no interpretatin of<br/>the step sizes is necessary, although we<br/>might speculate as to which permutations<br/>were used when or how often.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105711 href="#105711">ðŸ”—</a>gedankenwelt94 &#x3C;gedankenwelt94@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2012 5:27:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A link to the wiki with the right target:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Graph-theoretic+properties+of+scales#Seven%20note%20scales-Gypsy">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Graph-theoretic+properties+of+scales#Seven%20note%20scales-Gypsy</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The same scale can be explained harmonically as a combination<br/>&gt; of the E, B7/5, and F#6 chords.
