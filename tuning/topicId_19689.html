Do people really<br/>appreciate the SENSITIVITY of the true dog snout??  (And I don&apos;t mean<br/>Feuersnot... that was by Strauss...)</p><p>The dogs in my highrise actually KNOW their own FLOORS by smell...<br/>I&apos;m assuming, of course, that they can&apos;t read the elevator floor<br/>numbers....</p><p>It&apos;s incredible.</p><p>Could you imagine if we had the sensitity to SOUND that these<br/>creatures have for SMELL!!</p><p>What amazing microtonal music we would write!  And the entire world<br/>would soon get &quot;on the scent&quot;!!!</p><p>________ ______ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>The above is not science, but true &quot;dogsh_t&quot; as Nikita Kruschev was<br/>to call the &quot;decadent abstract&quot; artists of CCCP time!</p></div>
