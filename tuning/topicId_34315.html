I appreciate your candid &quot;take&quot; on what I&apos;m doing<br/>and, in fact, especially appreciate the &quot;critical&quot; analysis... which<br/>is valuable for me.</p><p>Well, composers should be able to take about *anything* they&apos;re given<br/>and make something of it, if they know what they&apos;re doing and have<br/>ability.  Surely, I&apos;m restricted by the TX81Z patches, but since it&apos;s<br/>such a *tunable* synth it still has quite a bit of utility and<br/>my &quot;appetite&quot; for acquiring debt through gear purchasing is limited<br/>(unlike, I realize, many MIDI musicians... :) ).</p><p>Over on MakeMicroMusic where, incidentally, this discussion probably<br/>should be taking place, since the &quot;big&quot; Tuning List has become more<br/>of a forum for &quot;tuning theory&quot; of late, I&apos;ve been working to<br/>add &quot;reverb&quot; to my pieces.  I was rather &quot;shy&quot; of it, since it seemed<br/>to add an element that capriciously distorted the tuning, which I<br/>wanted to emphasize.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve been learning that perhaps just a *little* reverb,<br/>applied in the right way, may do a lot for my pieces without doing<br/>too much *damage* to the audible tuning.  I&apos;m also learning to add<br/>more *dynamic* elements, something that I &quot;messed up&quot; just by<br/>confusion as to how to properly &quot;draw&quot; dynamic curves in the<br/>sequencer.</p><p>_Blect_, and all my Blackjack pieces are, I suppose, more<br/>*deliberate* than some of my earlier xenharmonic pieces, since I was<br/>working with lattices in front of me and knew what all the sonorities<br/>were and what I was trying to do with them.  In fact, it is true that<br/>many of the concepts and sounds in the piece resulted from various<br/>theoretical ideas and discussions we&apos;ve had on this Tuning List so,<br/>in a sense, it became a practical &quot;working out&quot; in sound of some of<br/>the concepts that appeared only in *text* on this forum...</p><p>So, in a sense, it probably is as &quot;calculated&quot; as a &quot;serial&quot; piece<br/>might be...although I hope doesn&apos;t sound like it!  :)  Again, I think<br/>any decent composer should, and does, transcend whatever &quot;working<br/>methods&quot; provide the basic materials for the composition.</p><p>In any case, thanks for your &quot;angle&quot; on all this...</p><p>JP</p></div>
