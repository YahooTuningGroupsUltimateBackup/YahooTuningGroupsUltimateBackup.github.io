When I did eventually<br/>settle into using (almost exclusively) intonation and tuning scenarios and<br/>methods that weren&apos;t the octave divided into twelve equal parts; I did so<br/>because I was utterly fascinated by both the immediate usefulness, and the<br/>latent possibilities of such a vastly expanded expressive and structural<br/>resource... And some fourteen or so years on, I have honestly yet to<br/>encounter a single tuning scenario that doesn&apos;t seem to (either by way of<br/>its particular or general usefulness) &apos;LIKE MUSIC...&apos; Clouds of beats/no<br/>beats, no fifths/all fifths, melodic commas/harmonic commas... the good the<br/>bad and the neutral - Fertile fields in all directions.**</p><p>When I first started looking into what &apos;microtonal&apos; literature I could (A)<br/>find, and (B) have even the remotest chance of understanding... three<br/>things seemed to jump right out at me: (1) The theoretical and technical<br/>scope was immense, _extremely_ daunting, and could probably prove to be<br/>just as alluring as the actual sounds themselves... (2) Until the<br/>widespread advent of the Internet, you probably had to windup quite outside<br/>the readily available channels*** to acquire much more than a misunderstood<br/>misrepresentation of Harry Partch and quartertones... and (3) From the<br/>&quot;trista&quot;**** of Hermann Helmholtz&apos; classic &quot;On the Sensation of Tone,&quot; to<br/>the red meat, processed sugars, and violent action movies***** of Kyle<br/>Gann&apos;s contemporary &quot;Just Intonation Explained&quot; -- my personal awe and<br/>admiration of an undiminished pitch continuum (where all the possible<br/>structural and emotional resources one could find and make useful were as<br/>such _fundamentally_ useful******) seemed to be standing in direct<br/>opposition to the ideological equilibrium of just intonation.</p><p>In his introduction to the 1954 edition of &quot;On The Sensation Of Tone,&quot;<br/>Henry Margenau would write: &quot;...and the musician finds in it unexhausted<br/>treasure if he wishes to understand his art...&quot; While I certainly believe<br/>that he got the unexhausted treasure part right(!), I also believe that the<br/>indicative &quot;IF&quot; of an &quot;if he wishes to understand his art,&quot;******* has<br/>fostered not only the careful and considered &apos;high accountabilities&apos; of<br/>physiological literatim (et al...), but also a host of axiomatic<br/>perorations that to this day comprise a sizable portion of the<br/>tuning/intonation narrative.</p><p>Dan</p><p>*Anyone who might be interested in hearing a specific audio example of<br/>these types of &quot;various attempts at manipulating regulating and aligning<br/>intonation,&quot; can see Silvered.ram/.rm, or Blue Caro.ram/.rm @ Jeff<br/>Collins&apos;: <a href="http://members.xoom.com/Minor2nd/">http://members.xoom.com/Minor2nd/</a></p><p>**Though it should go without saying - Just because I personally happen to<br/>have be open and receptive to all these different types of tuning<br/>possibilities, that is in no way meant to imply that I believe my music to<br/>be any better off than that created out of the most excluding and<br/>uncontestable &apos;way it is&apos; intonational view.
