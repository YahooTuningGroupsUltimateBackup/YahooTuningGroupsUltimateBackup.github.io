It was free.  (Although there have been performances with Partch&apos;s instruments in New York City in the past, I never found out about them in time to attend.)  When I met with Harry in Champaign in the summer of 1960, his instruments were in storage, although he took me to see them.  So this was the first time I ever heard them in a live performance.  Some were orignials and some were replacements, such as the chromolodeon and the bamboo marimba.<br/>About 150 people attended.  Some were standing in the rear although scattered seats sere available.  The seating capacity of the recital hall in McEachern Hall is about 175.  It is designed for good acoustics.<br/>The program started with a brief discussion and demonstration of the instruments by Dean Drummond, followed by &quot;Ring Around the Moon&quot; .   After some rearrangements on stage, Newband played Drummond&apos;s &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;, followed by more rearranging and his &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, which had premiered earlier this summer elsewhere.  Both of these used instruments he invented in addition to Partch&apos;s:  the zoomoozophone and justrokerods.  Although the audience reception was excellent, the group was apparently unprepared to do an encore.<br/>As best as I could tell, the performances were excellent, compared to familiar recordings of &quot;Ring Around the Moon&quot;.  A slight change was made in the text, substituting &quot;twinkie-winkie&quot; for &quot;itsy-bitsy&quot; after the words &quot;teeny-weenie&quot;.  Perhaps this was to avoid association with the song about the yellow polka dot bikini, even though that was written about ten years after &quot;Ring&quot;.  I wonder whether Paul Vance and/or Lee Pockriss got the idea for their title from Partch&apos;s text.  Does anyone know?<br/>Dean Drummond expects to teach a course at MSU in the spring semester if enough students sign up.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Jonathan M.
