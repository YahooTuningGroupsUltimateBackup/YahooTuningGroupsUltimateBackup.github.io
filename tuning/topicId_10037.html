Stick to a<br/>four-stringed lyre for accompanying solo voices, perhaps auloi and small<br/>percussion (frame drums, bones) for vocal ensembles, dance or incidental<br/>music (one might use contrasting ensembles for Greeks and Trojans).  A<br/>useable lyre can be built from a wooden salad bowl, three sticks (2 for<br/>arms, one for the cross piece) and a rawhide skin. Gut strings can be<br/>handwound from sausage casings bought at a local butcher. The tuning of the<br/>four-toned lyre was probably in a single tetrachord.  Reconstructing auloi<br/>is trickier, but you might like to start by listening to Korean pi&apos;ri<br/>playing.  Someone in California (Jim French? -- help me out, Kraig) has had<br/>some success in making auloi.</p><p>If duplicating the original instruments isn&apos;t your thing, but you&apos;d like to<br/>explore later greek and hellenistic tunings, Lou Harrison came up with a<br/>easy substitute for a lyre or kithara - put mandolin machines on a guitar,<br/>so that one can have a pair of full tetrachords. Classical lyre technique<br/>was probably limited to playing open strings and samisen-style full plectrum<br/>strokes with the strings stopped autoharp-style, but natural harmonics<br/>_could_ have been used as well.</p><p>I like M.L. West&apos;s book on Greek music as well as Douglas Leedy&apos;s article on<br/>singing in Greek and Latin (in the Roland Jackson _Festschrift_)</p><p>On the other hand, if you&apos;d like to work, like Partch, in a classical spirit<br/>but not letter, then just let your imagination loose.</p><p>From: Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:STICK@USWEST.NET">STICK@USWEST.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Here&apos;s one for you tuning historians...I got a call to possibly get<br/>&gt; involved in a play here in Denver about the Trojan wars.</p></div>
