Perhaps someone could indulge me by telling me:<br/>&gt; 1) What is it?</p><p>Manuel&apos;s own description: &quot;Scala is a very complete freeware editor/librarian/analysis tool for tunings. It allows scales to be created, manipulated and combined in many ways. There is a large library of scales available. Various different synthesizers and samplers can be tuned via standard MIDI-files.&quot;</p><p>&gt; 2) Where can I get it?</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe</a></p><p>(I believe that link is still good)</p><p>&gt; 3) Will it run on Windows XP Professional?</p><p>I believe so. Scala has been designed fairly platform-independent, and comes from a command-line type of history, not a GUI based pedigree. The GUI toolkit in use isn&apos;t the easiest or most native to Windows, but it does work.</p><p>&gt; 4) Will it work for all MIDI synths, or just those that support<br/>&gt; some particular feature?</p><p>There are aspects of Scala that you can use with virtually any synth, it really depends on your &apos;needs&apos;. Another program you might enjoy, which works very well together with Scala, is Robert Walker&apos;s Fractal Tune Smithy:</p><p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts_download.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts_download.htm</a></p><p>From Robert: &quot;Originally an algo-comp program, Fractal Tune Smithy is now often used for microtonal composition / improvisation as well. Retunes to scale entered as cents, ratios or whatever. Uses pitch bends and re-mapping of midi channels to do this rather than tuning tables - so it will work with any GM compatible synth or soundcard. Includes many of the SCALA scales and modes, and one can use it to make a searchable drop lists of all the SCALA scales and all the SCALA modes. (Windows only)&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m just pissed neither program does a decent job of slicing cheeze. You know, real thin slices that don&apos;t get all mucked up.</p><p>Gad, it&apos;s late...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (who is also putting in a plug for the Making Microtonal Music forum, where some of the dirty work goes on...)</p></div><h3><a id=42434 href="#42434">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>2/19/2003 1:01:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;In a very short amount of time (just a hunch on my part), the author -<br/>Manuel Op de Coul - will probably &gt;come online and tell you everything you<br/>need to know.
