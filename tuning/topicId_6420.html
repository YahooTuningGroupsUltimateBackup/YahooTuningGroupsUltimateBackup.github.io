Joel Mandelbaum&apos;s 1962 dissertation (p. 370), although it is only<br/>applied to 3 ratios at a time here (and it&apos;s not clear how to<br/>extrapolate this to more--I couldn&apos;t find any of Paul Ehrlich&apos;s quote of<br/>Chalmers-suggested articles in the Minneapolis libraries other than the<br/>Barbour one in the 1948 American Mathematical Monthly).</p><p>I certainly can see its value for the JI community in particular, or for<br/>those who&apos;d like to create precise subdivisions (ET or not) of some<br/>&apos;substitute for the octave&apos; ratio.</p><p>However, my effort, which was to find a close match to several ratios<br/>(without necessarily any precise match), seems still to be most easily<br/>accomplished by seeking out common factors to values near the logs of<br/>the ratios by experimentation with a spreadsheet.</p><p>I suspect that a spline algorithm might also be a more formal way to<br/>solve this kind of problem. Any ideas along those lines?</p><p>The most useful to me so far is 27.35 ET, nearly the same as 44-CET,<br/>which matches 7/6, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4, and 9/7 within either 3 or 8 cents.</p><p>I&apos;m still looking for one or more which would match the inversion of<br/>these ratios (meaning each of the above * 4/3) with similar accuracy,<br/>and also have a reasonably useable fifth.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/1999 8:11:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;However, my effort, which was to find a close match to several ratios<br/>&gt;(without necessarily any precise match), seems still to be most easily<br/>&gt;accomplished by seeking out common factors to values near the logs of<br/>&gt;the ratios by experimentation with a spreadsheet.</p><p>Harold, you may want to check out the method Gary Morrison used to find<br/>88CET.  I think it&apos;s a graphic version of the GCF method.  The neat thing<br/>about it was it could be done by hand, with paper and pencil, and you can<br/>see exactly the compromise you&apos;re making.  I have a sheet on it I could dig<br/>up, or maybe Gary could explain it.  Did I see it on the web somewhere, Gary?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Like as one moves down in layers, I have made<br/>alterations to the formula to introduce new limit ratios. I have found out<br/>that Wilson has done the same. One need not always stick to the obvious to<br/>get good results and sometimes these little excursions had a real artistic<br/>flair to your tuning.</p><p>&quot;Paul H.

A 4/3<br/>divided into 13 equal parts (~31.3 ET) would give the &quot;inversion of<br/>these ratios (meaning each of the above * 4/3)&quot; with matching<br/>(rounded) errors of -1, 9, 3, 3, and 14&#xFFFD; for instance (this would also<br/>give a fifth of ~690&#xFFFD;, which I think would still fall into your<br/>&quot;reasonably useable&quot; range)...</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2010 5:16:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike~</p><p>i think it is extremely useful. and can be a bit fun too</p><p>you can find a discussion of it in Mandelbaums book on starting on page 370<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/mandelbaum.html">http://anaphoria.com/mandelbaum.html</a><br/> in chapter 13 i think.</p><p>It is worth looking here too<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/viggo3.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/viggo3.PDF</a><br/>to see an example of how it answers produce things in between.<br/> also it shows how you can seed the algorithm with more than one term.<br/> In fact you could put in there anything you wanted from rationals to irrationals if there was some of those one liked</p><p>The other articles in<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a><br/> on viggo brun show how it can also be applied to scale numbers too</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Aug 10, 2010 at 7:54 AM, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is the Viggo Brun algorithm?<br/>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2010 12:02:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   also it shows how you can seed the algorithm with more than<br/>&gt; one term.<br/>&gt;   In fact you could put in there anything you wanted from<br/>&gt; rationals to irrationals if there was some of those one liked</p><p>If you are using computer algebra and not a hand computation you can make things easier on yourself if you use only rational numbers and forget about the part where you keep track of how many of each interval make up your original list of intervals.

I have not found it useful for rhythms though</p><p> I find i like doing things by hand often because i can watch how a scale develops and can be aware of the different direction it might take. Which is also the case when i pursue constant structures. When i was trying to solve the problem with the dekanies, finding the least number of tones i needed to add there were often alternatives that i am glad i could choose from instead of just getting an answer.</p><p>I meant to mention how the 22 scale of India might be one of the earliest examples of a microtemperment where the chain of 22 3/2s forms skismatic equivalents of 5/4 after 8 steps down.</p><p>With MOS and what i think we might call SubMOS patterns at this time i find that i sometimes can go to a third layer. the MOS of an MOS of an MOS. Past that point i have not once made it work once that i can think of. With Rhythm too as it gives quite a bit of variation in duration</p><p> At this point it is almost like a Xenakis Sieve method but surely applied to something with potentially a more acoustical basis .</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   also it shows how you can seed the algorithm with more than<br/>&gt; &gt; one term.<br/>&gt; &gt;   In fact you could put in there anything you wanted from<br/>&gt; &gt; rationals to irrationals if there was some of those one liked<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are using computer algebra and not a hand computation you can make things easier on yourself if you use only rational numbers and forget about the part where you keep track of how many of each interval make up your original list of intervals.
