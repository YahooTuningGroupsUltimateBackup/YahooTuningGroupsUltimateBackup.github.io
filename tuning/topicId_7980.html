What did<br/>&gt;&gt;I miss?</p><p>Paul Erlich responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is what you missed: On Wed 1/19/00 12:41 PM, Joe Monzo wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve added another rendition of the chord to the end of the<br/>&gt;&gt;MIDI file, with a glissando from 4:5 to 7:9.</p><p>I saw that post and downloaded it. I couldn&apos;t open it for some reason. This<br/>is a bit confusing, I know, since I&apos;ve been about a day behind in keeping up<br/>with the flow due to an OVERflow of other important matters. So does this<br/>mean that if I got seven items I got the new one? I assume yes unless<br/>corrected. And if so, my impression of Monz&apos;s 7:9 was that it is far too<br/>high. Nevertheless, John Link&apos;s 7:9 third and the &quot;young9.mid&quot; chord (see my<br/>other post coming in this batch) have raised the 7:9 third as &quot;most likely<br/>to succeed,&quot; in my opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it appears the two chords you thought sounded like a sus chord were in<br/>&gt; fact the ones with 32:25 and 7:9 third. Vibrato aside, it seems, as I<br/>&gt; suspected you would, that you&apos;ve now judged the 7:9 major third as too high<br/>&gt; for even the &quot;high third&quot;. Furthermore, I&apos;ll venture a guess as to the<br/>&gt; reason you thought these were sus chords: due to the thirds in the example<br/>&gt; getting larger and larger, and the fact that you&apos;re not used to hearing<br/>&gt; microtonal climbs in pitch, your ear at some point decided that the pitch<br/>&gt; was a half-step above the major third, i.e., a perfect fourth.</p><p>Perhaps. However, my judgement that it sounded like a sus chord was not an<br/>intellectual conclusion drawn from the highness of the third, rather it was<br/>a perceptual gestalt--a sonority, a quality, a color--that I recognized from<br/>years of having heard and used a sus chord. This is not a rebuttal, merely a<br/>subjective report. I&apos;ll keep an open mind on the subject.</p><p>&gt; However, if<br/>&gt; the example started with a 6:8:9 (sus chord) and then went down to 14:18:21<br/>&gt; (chord with 7:9 major third), you would probably hear it as a major triad,<br/>&gt; albeit still an out-of-tune one. Joe?</p><p>Sounds like a worthwhile effort. I&apos;m open.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, Jerry, you evidently did not express an opinion about the fifth<br/>&gt; chord, the one with a 11:14 major third. Given the amount of vibrato in the<br/>&gt; example, I don&apos;t blame you. Still, I&apos;m curious.</p><p>At this point, I&apos;m not sure what the fifth chord is (was). As I mentioned to<br/>Monz, the whole thing might be more helpful to add sustain after the bend<br/>arrives.</p><p>Jerry<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=8087 href="#8087">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
