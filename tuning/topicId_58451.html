A price tag included will be most<br/>appreciated.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, that isn&apos;t quite possible. Usually, this amounts to &quot;the<br/>sky is the limit&quot;. When I&apos;ve got more time I can post a couple of past<br/>links (if they are still good) that gave examples of a couple people<br/>who do this that were quite illustrative.</p><p>But you know what? A lot of it has to do with 2 things:</p><p>1. Using your ears (and I *don&apos;t* mean that facetiously!)<br/>2. Understanding the thing you are trying to replicate</p><p>This kind of answer that I&apos;m giving will probably be frustrating, but<br/>the above 2 elements can lead you in quite a number of different<br/>directions. For example, some of the articles I&apos;ve posted in the past<br/>(mostly on MMM, I&apos;m afraid) were dealing with hardware synthesizers.<br/>As anyone who frequents MMM knows, we&apos;re going through a fairly large<br/>shift in electronic music right now from hardware to software. I don&apos;t<br/>mean to imply that hardware synths will be replaced by soft, but that<br/>there are now alternatives that are more cost - and space - effective.</p><p>If you concentrate only on point #2 above, one could think about Tom&apos;s<br/>comment: that an entire violin section can&apos;t _musically_ be emulated<br/>by one line or pass through a synth. [Please note that while I am<br/>using the term &quot;synth&quot;, you could substitute any sound generation<br/>device, for example Gene uses soundfonts frequently]. If you were to<br/>record a number of passes of the same violin line, with slightly<br/>differing velocities, attacks, aftertouch, etc, you come closer to<br/>mixing the infinite variety of nuances (and fallicies!) happening at<br/>any time in a violin section.</p><p>I fear I might babble too much, and that the tuning list might not be<br/>the appropriate forum. But some composers I know have been able to get<br/>good orchestral simulations using a small number of samplers layered<br/>with other instruments, while big-time Hollywood types have racks and<br/>racks of these. The bottom line is listening to your result, and<br/>spending time trying to build in the phrasings and nuances of the type<br/>ensemble you are attempting to represent. Taking a basic midi file and<br/>dumping it through a generalised instrument, even with a little<br/>processing, is probably going to yield lesser results.</p><p>Two last things:</p><p>1. Trying to recreate orchestral/classical stuff isn&apos;t the only way to<br/>go, and Gene has done other stuff with the same tools that I like.</p><p>2. I haven&apos;t even mentioned the next hurdle - doing all this<br/>convincingly *and* making it microtonal!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=58587 href="#58587">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2005 8:46:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Film composers, I&apos;m afraid, have technical resources I don&apos;t have.</p><p>Yes, I understand that and sympathise as well. And their methods might<br/>*not* be the ideal thing for you. On the other hand, I don&apos;t think<br/>that you&apos;ve tried any of the options that I patiently put on MMM a<br/>long time ago for you, WRT phrasing, multiple lines, etc. It would<br/>also require a good midi editing environment and very likely a good<br/>midi input device, like a keyboard. I know this isn&apos;t your preferred<br/>method.</p><p>&gt; Even if I spent the money, one great difficulty is overcoming the 12et<br/>&gt; straightjacket. Timidity is the only program I know which fully<br/>&gt; implements the midi tuning standard, and I don&apos;t know how to get good<br/>&gt; tuning results, other than using Csound, unless I use MTS.</p><p>These are the methods if you simply want to pour in a midi file and<br/>have an audio file come out the other end. I think I was pointing to<br/>other methods that would be more labor intensive. Also, as I mentioned<br/>to Ozan, I am not exactly sure how anyone could best go about doing<br/>this; I *know* it can be done in 12, but you would have to be willing<br/>to do a lot of work to get a similar result in non12.</p><p>It is a crossroads right now. I&apos;m not convinced we&apos;ll see a microtonal<br/>nirvana anytime soon, but at least an awareness of how well a<br/>simulation can be done, along with the awareness of the weaknesses of<br/>the current methods, is good for pondering.</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=58589 href="#58589">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2005 8:58:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you concentrate only on point #2 above, one could think about Tom&apos;s<br/>&gt; comment: that an entire violin section can&apos;t _musically_ be emulated<br/>&gt; by one line or pass through a synth.
