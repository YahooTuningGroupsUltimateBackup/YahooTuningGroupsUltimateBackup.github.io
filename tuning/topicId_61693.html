In fact, a quartertone is a gateway<br/>&gt; interval, often leading to other distinctive microtonalalia.</p><p>&gt; it&apos;s funny, is the quartertone so popular because of the acedemic<br/>&gt; popularity<br/>&gt; of composers like Carillo and Wyschenegradsky, or is it the multiple of<br/>&gt; 12<br/>&gt; factor, or both, or none of the above?</p><p>I didn&apos;t know these duudes were popular in academia?  I don&apos;t think even<br/>quarter-tone are &quot;popular&quot; in academia,  at least as far as &quot;standard rep&quot;<br/>goes.  Not in too many textbooks anyway.</p><p>On the other hand,  I&apos;d say at least half of the young composers I know do<br/>microtonal things,  systematic or not,  in much of their work.</p><p>the (mostly French) spectral school had an interesting approach (Tristan<br/>Murail,  Gerard Grisey,  etc.):  A quarter-Tone is a &quot;symbol&quot; of a &quot;more<br/>exact&quot; pitch ---  the idea being that musical/sonic context will suggest<br/>to the player that they should tune the note up or down a certain number<br/>of cents . .  .</p><p>For example, they might write a C7 chord with a B-3-1/4-flat,  the player<br/>should figure out that that B3/4b is a 7/4 and tune accordingly.</p><p>CB</p></div>
