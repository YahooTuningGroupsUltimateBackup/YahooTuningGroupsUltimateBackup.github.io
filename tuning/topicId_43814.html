In<br/>effect, that&apos;s what the devotees of microtonal music have been doing<br/>since the California maverick composer Harry Partch began building his<br/>unique 43-tones-per-octave instruments during the Depression. At the<br/>seventh annual MicroFest, continuing throughout May in various venues<br/>in the Los Angeles area, some contemporary composers are taking full<br/>advantage of the many tones &quot;between the keys&quot; to paint new and<br/>colorful soundscapes.</p><p>&quot;The best microtonal music uses new sounds to create new musical<br/>emotions that never existed before,&quot; explains guitarist, music<br/>professor, and radio show host John Schneider, who for the past two<br/>decades has been a principal microtonalist maven. &quot;In the world of<br/>art, it would be as if someone sent us a paint box from Mars, with all<br/>these colors we&apos;ve never seen before. All these composers who are<br/>exploring this world have found a new vocabulary of meaning and<br/>feeling-in spite of the fact that microtonality has been around forever.&quot;</p><p>Much of the music made in human history was actually written for the<br/>&quot;pure&quot; intervals that exist in the natural overtones of instruments-a<br/>tuning system known as &quot;just intonation,&quot; in which sounds are produced<br/>by dividing the length of a vibrating string or column of air into<br/>halves, thirds, fifths, and other rational ratios.</p><p>Different keys really had different sounds, affording composers<br/>infinite nuances of expression, but, because some keys became too<br/>dissonant, limiting available harmonies and key changes. And just<br/>intonation&apos;s many possible forms made it hard to combine in the same<br/>orchestra instruments that might have been built in different tunings.</p><p>As instruments began to be mass produced in the 19th century, a<br/>standardized tuning system called &quot;equal temperament&quot; emerged, in<br/>which the distance between any given pair of notes was roughly the<br/>same no matter what octave they were played in. For all its practical<br/>convenience, however, equal temperament was, to the sensitive ears of<br/>microtonalists, an imperfect compromise: It destroyed the natural<br/>beauty produced by pure intervals, made some intervals quite<br/>dissonant, and deprived composers of far too many options beyond its<br/>major and minor modes. As Partch said, an artist has five shades of<br/>red, so why should composers have only one C sharp?</p><p>Recovering the lost tunings that Bach and earlier composers used was<br/>one of the prime motivations of the 1960s early-music revival, and<br/>those medieval, Renaissance and Baroque tunings drew Mr. Schneider and<br/>many others into the microtonalist camp. &quot;It wasn&apos;t curiosity&quot; that<br/>attracted him to just intonation, Mr. Schneider says, &quot;it was lust! I<br/>loved it so much from the moment I heard it, but I didn&apos;t know why it<br/>sounded so good.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Schneider and other guitarists opened this year&apos;s MicroFest with a<br/>concert of microtonal guitar music, including &quot;Scenes From Nek Chand,&quot;<br/>one of the last compositions by that other great pioneer of<br/>microtonality, Lou Harrison, who, days after reading Partch&apos;s book on<br/>the subject in 1949, bought a tuning hammer for his piano and &quot;never<br/>looked back,&quot; producing characteristically melodic microtonal music<br/>for keyboards, harp, gamelan and instruments he built himself.<br/>Stringed instruments such as guitars are more readily retunable than<br/>wind instruments, and &quot;Nek Chand,&quot; written for a specially built<br/>National Steel guitar, recalled the languorous &quot;slack-key&quot; Hawaiian<br/>guitar music popular in Harrison&apos;s youth in the 1920s.</p><p>The May 9 concert was a tribute to Harrison, who died in February,<br/>featuring music he wrote for the gamelan orchestras of Indonesia. Any<br/>worries that microtonal music must sound weird or out of tune were<br/>immediately alleviated by his ravishing &quot;In Honor of Aphrodite&quot; for<br/>gamelan and chorus, and other lyrical works on the program, performed<br/>by the Donald Brinegar Singers and the Harvey Mudd College American<br/>Gamelan.</p><p>The recent surge in so-called world music has introduced microtonal<br/>music to an increasing number of Westerners-the sounds are found in<br/>the scales used in much vocal music from Arabia and Africa and the<br/>sitars of India, and in other cultures that didn&apos;t adopt equal<br/>temperament. The May 16 concert featured a tribute to composer Terry<br/>Riley, one of the inventors of musical minimalism, who began writing<br/>microtonal music in the 1960s after falling under the spell of<br/>traditional Indian music. He&apos;s since written dozens of works in just<br/>intonation, including the topical &quot;Baghdad Highway,&quot; premiered here<br/>along with a new documentary about his life by filmmaker Cecilia<br/>Miniucchi.</p><p>The May 11 concert showed another reason for microtonality&apos;s growing<br/>popularity: technology. Synthesizers and computers have made it<br/>possible for composers to write in any tuning they wish without having<br/>to construct or retune a whole set of instruments. Bill Alves&apos;s &quot;Mass<br/>Destruction&quot; (which might well have been titled &quot;George W. Meets Jimi<br/>H.&quot;) combined blazing electric viola and computer samples of some of<br/>the less felicitous words of the leader of the free world. Mr. Alves,<br/>a composer at Harvey Mudd College who helped organize the festival,<br/>also contributed an effective digital realization of Harrison&apos;s<br/>landmark 1955 &quot;Simfony in Free Style,&quot; the computer approximating the<br/>timbres of recorders and viols for which Harrison composed the work.<br/>Due to the difficulty of obtaining retuned instruments and sympathetic<br/>musicians, it has never been performed by real instruments.</p><p>That points up the difficulty of performing microtonal music in the<br/>Western classical/art-music establishment: Musicians who&apos;ve devoted<br/>years to internalizing the equal temperament that&apos;s so dominated<br/>Western music for a century have to retune their instruments-and<br/>ears-to embrace this wider spectrum of sounds. But more and more<br/>composers are listening. And this MicroFest showed that more and more<br/>audiences are too; MicroFest attendance has risen steadily.</p><p>Just as different artists can use the same color quite differently,<br/>composers-including rock and electronica bands like Sonic Youth and<br/>Radiohead-are using microtones to paint diverse sonic canvases in so<br/>many styles that listeners can easily find some they enjoy. After<br/>prolonged exposure to the rich, kaleidoscopic world of microtones,<br/>returning to equal-tempered music was for me like going back to black<br/>and white after spending a weekend immersed in color.</p><p>Mr. Campbell last wrote for the Journal on the late composer Lou Harrison.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2003 5:08:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;bill_alves&quot; &lt;ALVES@O...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Much of the music made in human history was actually written for the<br/>&gt; &quot;pure&quot; intervals that exist in the natural overtones of<br/>instruments-a<br/>&gt; tuning system known as &quot;just intonation,&quot; in which sounds are<br/>produced<br/>&gt; by dividing the length of a vibrating string or column of air into<br/>&gt; halves, thirds, fifths, and other rational ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Different keys really had different sounds,</p><p>the misconceptions and confusions are repeated yet again.</p><p>&gt; For all its<br/>practical<br/>&gt; convenience, however, equal temperament was, to the sensitive ears<br/>of<br/>&gt; microtonalists, an imperfect compromise: It destroyed the natural<br/>&gt; beauty produced by pure intervals, made some intervals quite<br/>&gt; dissonant,</p><p>microtonalists like julia are bristling right now if they&apos;re reading<br/>this.</p></div>
