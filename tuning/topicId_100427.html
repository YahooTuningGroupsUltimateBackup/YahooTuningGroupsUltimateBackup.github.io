Despite the errors contained in the 624 progression cells, the Piagui scales were derived. However, the new ordained cells gave information regarding the musical octave.</p><p>The purpose of the progression was also the determining of the true range of the musical octave. The analysis of the corrected set made possible the understanding of new properties which are indorsements of the existance of two close values of the octave. The first one is 2, but this cell is far from the final cell by only 12 cells that gives (531441 / 262144) = 2.027286529541010 = (9^6) / (8^6).</p><p>I guess that you might say that the difference between these two values is too much but in the other hand the progression is formed by twelve sections of cells each having (9/8)^(1/2), along which all the consonant ratios given by the cells take part. So it would be irregular to cancel part of one section to force 2 for the octave. I wonder if the 12 final cells group that equals to the pythagorean comma has some thing to do with the &quot;imperfection of the man ear&quot;.</p><p>The new ordained subgroups of cells contain [3*(18 + 18 + 16 -- 18 + 18 + 16 -- 18 + 18 + 16 -- 18 + 18 + 16)] = 624 CELLS.<br/>If any cell is multiplied by 4/3 or by 3/2, the exact value of a higher cell is obtained.</p><p>I continue with the analysis.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario</p><p>June, 28</p></div>
