But i&apos;m glad you did. Although some of you have (in my opinion) much too simplistic ideas for such large, intricate brains. I found that curious.</p><p>Alas, E-mail has a way of being composed on the fly, and it may not be the best medium for certain minds.</p><p>Nevertheless, thanks for all the public and private response.</p><p>Happy Dependance Day everyone,</p><p>GZ</p></div>
