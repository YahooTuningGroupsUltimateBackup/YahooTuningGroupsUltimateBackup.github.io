In fact, he shortened<br/>the final 3rd Act by two scenes, ending abruptly but skillfully<br/>after the first scene, because it was &apos;getting cold&apos;.</p><p>The truth is, for at least the entire hour and a half the California<br/>night had already been much colder than any outdoor audience in Java<br/>would have experienced, and just about everyone had blankets and<br/>jackets on by the end.</p><p>The musicians were from the SDSU [San Diego State University]<br/>Javanese Gamelan (Djoko Walujo, musical director).  The music,<br/>played and sung generally between the scenes of the story,<br/>was evocative, using a variety of pentatonic scales that had<br/>some very xenharmonic intervals in them.  The gamelan section<br/>I liked most was the one just after the end of the story,<br/>before the closing song.  It had &apos;major&apos; sound, with a type<br/>of &apos;major 7th&apos; as part of the melody, but with some instruments<br/>adding a really funky &apos;neutral-tending-to minor 7th&apos; in some parts.</p><p>The performance will be repeated Sunday in Escondido, and Monday<br/>evening at the SDSU campus.  It was suggested to me by Danlee<br/>Mitchell (who monitored several video cameras) that those performances<br/>will probably be musically tighter, and the one at SDSU is indoors.</p><p>-monz</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
