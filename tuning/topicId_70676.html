The first mention of the comma in reference to Maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; Music is by Antoine Murat (an Europeanized Turk of the late<br/>&gt; &gt; 18th century), who conspicuously implies 55-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you sure about that? 55-edo behaves very differently<br/>&gt; from 53-edo.<br/>&gt;</p><p>From Aksoy, B. &quot;Music of the Ottomans from the Perspective of European<br/>Travellers&quot;, &apos;cf. Antoine Murat&apos;, pp. 163-5 (title and contents translated<br/>by me):</p><p>...</p><p>The compass of Turkish Music spans two octaves. An octave is divided into<br/>two tetrachords, each of whose tonic equals the corresponding tones of<br/>European Music. The tonic of the I. tetrachord is &apos;SOL&apos;, the II. is &apos;RE&apos;. I.<br/>Tetrachord comprises the tones &apos;SOL-LA-SI-DO&apos; [rast-dugah-segah-chargah],<br/>and II. &apos;RE-MI-FA-SOL&apos; [neva-huseyni-evj-gerdaniye]. Each of the tetrachords<br/>possesses three large natural intervals. Moreover, each interval is split<br/>into small intervals of equal value called &quot;commas&quot;. The first 9 commas form<br/>the primary basic interval [9:8]. This interval is betwixt the tonic &apos;sol&apos;<br/>and its major second. The 1. comma between &apos;SOL-LA&apos; makes a comma interval,<br/>3. comma a &quot;diminished second&quot;, 5. comma a &quot;minor second&quot;; at the 9. comma,<br/>the interval of a &quot;major second&quot; is completed. In the 7 comma interval of<br/>&apos;LA-SI&apos;, 1. comma yields a &quot;diminished third&quot;, 3. comma a &quot;minor second&quot;,<br/>and 7. comma (i.e., 16. comma after the tonic) a &quot;major third&quot; [27:22]. The<br/>3. comma of the &apos;SI-DO&apos; interval compounds the &quot;augmented third&quot;, and a<br/>perfect fourth is achieved at the 23. comma [4:3].</p><p>The II. tetrachord is divided similar to the I tetrachord. The two<br/>tetrachords are in exact symmetry with each other. The &apos;DO-RE&apos; major tone<br/>interval that seperates the two tetrachords is divided into smaller<br/>intervals of 1,3,5 commas just like the intervals of &apos;SOL-LA&apos; and &apos;RE-MI&apos;.<br/>The tonic of the II. tetrachord forms the fifth of the I. There are 32<br/>commas in this pentachord. In the entirety of the composite tetrachords made<br/>of the union of two disjunct tetrachords, there are 55 commas. As may be<br/>seen, amid each of the 7 intervals forming the octave, there are 3<br/>intermediate tones. Via the division of the primary intervals into three, it<br/>is observed that there are 21 intervals and 22 perdes in the Turkish octave.</p><p>...</p><p>He also goes on to say that segah is a comma lower than the European E and<br/>evj 3 commas higher than F, and remarks that one might think all this a<br/>cacophony at first, but indispensible nonetheless for Turkish Music - so<br/>much so, that replacing the European SI and FA in place of segah and evj<br/>would result in cacophony. He also says that commatic differences arise from<br/>maqam to maqam and major seconds may be transformed from 9 commas to 8, or<br/>even 6 and that major thirds could frolic about 17, 15 and 14.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=70688 href="#70688">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2007 8:25:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, even his ratio is off: (3/2)^53 / 2^31 (which is<br/>&gt; &gt; what he really means mathematically) has a ratio with<br/>&gt; &gt; terms which are so huge that my spreadsheet won&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; calculate them accurately -- so it&apos;s not 176777/177147,<br/>&gt; &gt; and anyway the numerator should be larger than the<br/>&gt; &gt; denominator, so those terms should be switched.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3^53/2^81 = 19383245667680019896796723/19342813113834066795298816</p><p>Thanks ... you know how i am -- it was bugging me to not<br/>know exactly what that ratio is.</p><p>However, dividing by 2^81 is a typo: that makes it<br/>3 octaves too large.

The first mention of the comma in reference to Maqam<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Music is by Antoine Murat (an Europeanized Turk of the late<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 18th century), who conspicuously implies 55-EDO.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you sure about that? 55-edo behaves very differently<br/>&gt; &gt; from 53-edo.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From Aksoy, B. &quot;Music of the Ottomans from the Perspective<br/>&gt; of European Travellers&quot;, &apos;cf. Antoine Murat&apos;, pp. 163-5<br/>&gt; (title and contents translated by me):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The compass of Turkish Music spans two octaves. An octave<br/>&gt; is divided into two tetrachords, each of whose tonic equals<br/>&gt; the corresponding tones of European Music. The tonic of<br/>&gt; the I. tetrachord is &apos;SOL&apos;, the II. is &apos;RE&apos;. I. Tetrachord<br/>&gt; comprises the tones &apos;SOL-LA-SI-DO&apos; [rast-dugah-segah-chargah],<br/>&gt; and II. &apos;RE-MI-FA-SOL&apos; [neva-huseyni-evj-gerdaniye]. Each of<br/>&gt; the tetrachords possesses three large natural intervals.<br/>&gt; Moreover, each interval is split into small intervals of<br/>&gt; equal value called &quot;commas&quot;. The first 9 commas form<br/>&gt; the primary basic interval [9:8]. This interval is betwixt<br/>&gt; the tonic &apos;sol&apos; and its major second. The 1. comma between<br/>&gt; &apos;SOL-LA&apos; makes a comma interval, 3. comma a &quot;diminished second&quot;,<br/>&gt; 5. comma a &quot;minor second&quot;; at the 9. comma, the interval of<br/>&gt; a &quot;major second&quot; is completed.</p><p>OK, well, exactly what he means by the &quot;1.comma&quot; is what<br/>we are trying to determine.</p><p>&quot;9.comma&quot; equaling the &quot;major second&quot; is going to be<br/>the same for both 53-edo (~203.77 cents) and 55-edo<br/>(~196.36 cents). What differentiates the two tunings<br/>is how the chromatic and diatonic semitones are arranged.</p><p>In 55-edo, &quot;5.comma&quot; (~109.09 cents) does always equal<br/>a &quot;minor second&quot;. 55-edo tempers out the syntonic-comma,<br/>so if our reference pitch &quot;SOL&quot; is &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;5.comma&quot;<br/>in 55-edo will always be &quot;Ab&quot;. All representations of<br/>&quot;G#&quot; in 55-edo will be &quot;4.comma&quot; (~87.27 cents).</p><p>However, this does not necessarily rule out 53-edo,<br/>because of the fact that 53-edo gives not only a superb<br/>approximation to pythaogrean tuning, but also a very good<br/>approximation to 5-limit JI. In other words, 53-edo does<br/>*not* temper out the syntonic-comma, but in fact represents<br/>it by 1 step of the tuning.</p><p>As a pythagorean approximation, 53-edo uses &quot;4.comma&quot;<br/>(~90.57 cents) as the &quot;minor second&quot; (diatonic semitone)<br/>and &quot;5.comma&quot; (~113.21 cents) as the &quot;augmented prime&quot;<br/>(chromatic semitone).</p><p>However, as a 5-limit JI approximation, it&apos;s the other<br/>way around: &quot;5.comma&quot; represents the JI &quot;minor second&quot;<br/>of ratio 16:15, and &quot;4.comma&quot; represents one version<br/>of the JI chromatic-semitone, namely the one with ratio<br/>135:128. Note that because the syntonic-comma is not<br/>tempered out, 53-edo also has another version of the<br/>chromatic semitone which represents ratio 25:24 and is<br/>&quot;3.comma&quot;.</p><p>Now, at first i really had no idea what Murat means by<br/>&apos;3.comma [designates] a &quot;diminished second&quot;&apos;. It doesn&apos;t<br/>work that way for either 55-edo or for 53-edo-as-pythagorean.<br/>In fact, in 55-edo, it&apos;s nowhere near any kind of &quot;second&quot;:<br/>assuming that we&apos;re determining intervals by constructing<br/>a chain-of-5ths, the &quot;3.comma&quot; in 55-edo (~65.45 cents)<br/>designates a &quot;doubly-augmented-6th&quot;, so that if &quot;SOL&quot; is &quot;G&quot;,<br/>then &quot;3.comma&quot; is &quot;Fx#&quot;.</p><p>The actual &quot;diminished second&quot; in a chain-of-5ths tuning is<br/>the -12 generator 5th, that is, 12 5ths down or 12 4ths up.</p><p>(Note that the convention on the tuning list these days<br/>is to use the smaller of two complementary intervals as<br/>the generator, so for meantone the 4th is generally named<br/>as the generator. In that case, reverse the signs ... but<br/>i still like to think of meantone in terms of 5ths.)</p><p>Anyway, following this, the &quot;diminished second&quot; of<br/>55-edo is ~21.82 cents, which is in fact &quot;1.comma&quot;.<br/>And because the syntonic-comma is tempered out in 55-edo,<br/>the &quot;diminished second&quot; in this tuning will *always*<br/>be &quot;1.comma&quot;. So now, unless his interval terminology<br/>is not being used correctly according to Western<br/>procedure, i&apos;m tempted to conclude that Murat is<br/>definitely not talking about 55-edo.</p><p>But as for 53-edo, the fact that the syntonic-comma is<br/>not tempered out in 53-edo means that there is no one-to-one<br/>correspondence between letter-notation and number of steps<br/>(commas), which makes things a bit complicated. But let&apos;s<br/>explore this further ...</p><p>As an approximation to pythagorean tuning, the -12<br/>generator-5th of 53-edo in fact leads to a note which is<br/>*lower* than the tonic. So i am doubtful that this is what<br/>Murat means.</p><p>Also according to the pythagorean approximation, 53-edo&apos;s<br/>&quot;3.comma&quot; (~67.92 cents) would be a &quot;doubly-diminished-3rd&quot;<br/>at -17 generator-5ths, or &quot;Bbbb&quot;. So this also doesn&apos;t<br/>correspond to what Murat says.</p><p>However, as you can see on my bingo-card lattice page</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/b/bingo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/b/bingo.aspx</a></p><p>(go to the &quot;5-limit bingo card viewer&quot; diagram at the<br/>bottom of the page and click on the link to &quot;53&quot;)</p><p>there are several different JI intervals represented<br/>by &quot;3.comma&quot; in 53-edo. The one closest to 1:1 is the 25:24<br/>chromatic-semitone which i noted above. The next closest is<br/>the ratio 648:625 or 2-3-5-monzo [* 4, -4&gt; (~62.57 cents),<br/>which is in fact one version of the JI &quot;diminished second&quot;<br/>-- it is called &quot;major diesis&quot; in the hexagonal diagram by<br/>Paul Erlich which appears at the top of my bingo-card page.<br/>Note that this interval plays a special role in 1/3-comma<br/>meantone and its close relative 19-edo; see my &quot;diesis&quot; page,<br/>definition #7:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diesis.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diesis.aspx</a></p><p>So it&apos;s beginning to look like what Murat had in mind<br/>was 53-edo as a representation of 5-limit JI.</p><p>&gt; In the 7 comma interval of &apos;LA-SI&apos;, 1. comma yields a<br/>&gt; &quot;diminished third&quot;, 3. comma a &quot;minor second&quot;, and<br/>&gt; 7. comma (i.e., 16. comma after the tonic) a &quot;major third&quot;<br/>&gt; [27:22]. The 3. comma of the &apos;SI-DO&apos; interval compounds<br/>&gt; the &quot;augmented third&quot;, and a perfect fourth is achieved<br/>&gt; at the 23. comma [4:3].</p><p>Oh no ... now things are really getting muddled, unless<br/>i just don&apos;t understand Murat&apos;s divisions.</p><p>If &quot;LA-SI&quot; means the interval from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, i can&apos;t<br/>figure out why he&apos;s dividing it into 7 commas instead<br/>of 8 or 9.</p><p>In 53-edo-as-pythagorean, the &quot;major second&quot; or &quot;whole tone&quot;<br/>will always be &quot;9.comma&quot;. In 53-edo-as-JI, the interval<br/>can contain varying numbers of commas depending on exactly<br/>which ratio is being considered. But even at that, the<br/>ratios being considered would normally be 9:8 (= &quot;9.comma&quot;)<br/>or 10:9 (= &quot;8.comma&quot;). The only &quot;major second&quot; in 5-limit JI<br/>which corresponds to &quot;7.comma&quot; in 53-edo is the ratio<br/>800:729 = 2-3-5-monzo [* -6, 2&gt; (~16.09 cents), which<br/>as you can see from the monzo is quite far from the origin.</p><p>The &quot;7.comma&quot; of &quot;LA-SI&quot;, &quot;16.comma after the tonic&quot;,<br/>indeed does not correspond to the typical 5-limit JI<br/>ratios. The pythagorean &quot;major third&quot; of ratio 81:64<br/>is &quot;18.comma&quot; (~407.55 cents) in 53-edo, and the JI<br/>&quot;major third&quot; of 5:4 ratio is &quot;17.comma&quot; (~384.91 cents).<br/>The &quot;16.comma&quot; (~362.26 cents) certainly is much closer<br/>to the 27:22 ratio which you interpolated into the quote<br/>from Murat</p><p>If Murat *does* mean 55-edo, then he seems to be using<br/>it not only as a meantone representation of 5-limit JI,<br/>but rather to represent 11-limit JI, which seems to be<br/>the interpretation you yourself understood him to mean.<br/>The 55-edo &quot;16.comma&quot; (~349.09 cents) does give a very<br/>good representation not only of 27:22 as you note, but<br/>also of the 11:9 &quot;neutral third&quot;.</p><p>As for &quot;1.comma&quot; of &quot;LA-SI&quot;: the JI &quot;diminished third&quot;<br/>represented in 53-edo by &quot;10.comma&quot; (~226.42 cents) is the<br/>closest one to the lattice origin, with ratio 256:225 =<br/>2-3-5-monzo [* -2, -2&gt;. There is another one just a bit<br/>farther at ratio 144:125 which is represented by &quot;11.comma&quot;,<br/>but Murat&apos;s description of &quot;1.comma&quot; in &quot;LA-SI&quot; shows that<br/>he is referring to &quot;10.comma&quot; after the tonic. So this<br/>interval description seems clear.</p><p>If he does mean 55-edo, the &quot;10.comma&quot; (~218.18 cents)<br/>actually does represent the -10 generator-5th &quot;diminished<br/>third&quot; of 55-edo.</p><p>His description of 3.comma of &quot;LA-SI&quot;, which is 12.comma<br/>after the tonic, as &quot;minor second&quot; makes no sense -- i<br/>believe this must be a typo for &quot;minor third&quot;. However,<br/>as with the &quot;7.comma&quot; above, this one also seems to be<br/>one comma too narrow. In 53-edo, the JI &quot;minor third&quot;<br/>of ratio 6:5 is represented by &quot;14.comma&quot; (~316.98 cents),<br/>and the pythagorean &quot;minor third&quot; of ratio 32:27 is<br/>&quot;13.comma&quot; (~294.34 cents). The &quot;12.comma&quot; is only<br/>~271.7 cents.</p><p>And again, with the &quot;augmented third&quot;, the closest one<br/>in JI is ratio 125:96 = 2-3-5-monzo [* -1, 3&gt;, but this<br/>is represented in 53-edo by &quot;20.comma&quot; (~452.83 cents)<br/>and according to Murat it should be 16+3 = &quot;19.comma&quot;<br/>after the tonic (~430.19 cents).</p><p>It looks here as if he either using 53-edo to refer<br/>to some intervals which are from a prime-limit higher<br/>than 5, or else maybe using a multiple-division. If<br/>it&apos;s the latter, then he seems to be assuming a 5-limit<br/>JI basis for the tetrachord and dividing the 9:8 into<br/>9 commas, which corresponds to 53-edo, and the 10:9<br/>into 7 commas, which corresponds to 46-edo: (10/9)^(1/7)<br/>is ~26.06 cents, and the EDO which has a step-size close<br/>to this is 46-edo.</p><p>&gt; The II. tetrachord is divided similar to the I tetrachord.<br/>&gt; The two tetrachords are in exact symmetry with each other.<br/>&gt; The &apos;DO-RE&apos; major tone interval that seperates the two<br/>&gt; tetrachords is divided into smaller intervals of 1,3,5 commas<br/>&gt; just like the intervals of &apos;SOL-LA&apos; and &apos;RE-MI&apos;.<br/>&gt; The tonic of the II. tetrachord forms the fifth of the I.<br/>&gt; There are 32 commas in this pentachord. In the entirety of<br/>&gt; the composite tetrachords made of the union of two disjunct<br/>&gt; tetrachords, there are 55 commas. As may be seen, amid each<br/>&gt; of the 7 intervals forming the octave, there are 3<br/>&gt; intermediate tones. Via the division of the primary intervals<br/>&gt; into three, it is observed that there are 21 intervals and<br/>&gt; 22 perdes in the Turkish octave.</p><p>OK, after spending most of my free time today working<br/>on this, at this point i give up. What Murat says here<br/>clearly refers to 55-edo. So i&apos;m not sure what&apos;s going<br/>on at those points where i earlier wrote that 55-edo<br/>doesn&apos;t fit his description and he must be referring to<br/>53-edo.

It doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; work that way for either 55-edo or for 53-edo-as-pythagorean.<br/>&gt; In fact, in 55-edo, it&apos;s nowhere near any kind of &quot;second&quot;:<br/>&gt; assuming that we&apos;re determining intervals by constructing<br/>&gt; a chain-of-5ths, the &quot;3.comma&quot; in 55-edo (~65.45 cents)<br/>&gt; designates a &quot;doubly-augmented-6th&quot;, so that if &quot;SOL&quot; is &quot;G&quot;,<br/>&gt; then &quot;3.comma&quot; is &quot;Fx#&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are thinking in terms foreign to Ottoman Music. Diminished second here<br/>surely means a second much smaller than minor. Saying &quot;doubly-augmented-6th&quot;<br/>has little musical meaning for the genre.</p><p>&gt; The actual &quot;diminished second&quot; in a chain-of-5ths tuning is<br/>&gt; the -12 generator 5th, that is, 12 5ths down or 12 4ths up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Note that the convention on the tuning list these days<br/>&gt; is to use the smaller of two complementary intervals as<br/>&gt; the generator, so for meantone the 4th is generally named<br/>&gt; as the generator. In that case, reverse the signs ... but<br/>&gt; i still like to think of meantone in terms of 5ths.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>As do I. Employing the complementary fourth as the generator interval has<br/>been adopted by Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek in describing the 24-tone Pythagorean<br/>model, thus does not appeal to me.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, following this, the &quot;diminished second&quot; of<br/>&gt; 55-edo is ~21.82 cents, which is in fact &quot;1.comma&quot;.<br/>&gt; And because the syntonic-comma is tempered out in 55-edo,<br/>&gt; the &quot;diminished second&quot; in this tuning will *always*<br/>&gt; be &quot;1.comma&quot;. So now, unless his interval terminology<br/>&gt; is not being used correctly according to Western<br/>&gt; procedure, i&apos;m tempted to conclude that Murat is<br/>&gt; definitely not talking about 55-edo.<br/>&gt;</p><p>He is definitely talking about 55-edo despite his usage of 3 commas as the<br/>diminished second.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But as for 53-edo, the fact that the syntonic-comma is<br/>&gt; not tempered out in 53-edo means that there is no one-to-one<br/>&gt; correspondence between letter-notation and number of steps<br/>&gt; (commas), which makes things a bit complicated. But let&apos;s<br/>&gt; explore this further ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As an approximation to pythagorean tuning, the -12<br/>&gt; generator-5th of 53-edo in fact leads to a note which is<br/>&gt; *lower* than the tonic. So i am doubtful that this is what<br/>&gt; Murat means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also according to the pythagorean approximation, 53-edo&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;3.comma&quot; (~67.92 cents) would be a &quot;doubly-diminished-3rd&quot;<br/>&gt; at -17 generator-5ths, or &quot;Bbbb&quot;. So this also doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; correspond to what Murat says.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Confer above. The best way to define a 3 comma interval is by direct<br/>reference to the 5 comma interval. It is a second, but not as large as the 5<br/>comma version, thus Murat&apos;s usage of the term &quot;diminished&quot; no matter how<br/>discordant this may seem with his general terminology. Hence, saying<br/>&quot;doubly-diminished-third&quot; does not hold much musical meaning for Maqam<br/>Music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, as you can see on my bingo-card lattice page<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/b/bingo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/b/bingo.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (go to the &quot;5-limit bingo card viewer&quot; diagram at the<br/>&gt; bottom of the page and click on the link to &quot;53&quot;)<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; there are several different JI intervals represented<br/>&gt; by &quot;3.comma&quot; in 53-edo. The one closest to 1:1 is the 25:24<br/>&gt; chromatic-semitone which i noted above. The next closest is<br/>&gt; the ratio 648:625 or 2-3-5-monzo [* 4, -4&gt; (~62.57 cents),<br/>&gt; which is in fact one version of the JI &quot;diminished second&quot;<br/>&gt; -- it is called &quot;major diesis&quot; in the hexagonal diagram by<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich which appears at the top of my bingo-card page.<br/>&gt; Note that this interval plays a special role in 1/3-comma<br/>&gt; meantone and its close relative 19-edo; see my &quot;diesis&quot; page,<br/>&gt; definition #7:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diesis.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diesis.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it&apos;s beginning to look like what Murat had in mind<br/>&gt; was 53-edo as a representation of 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Quite the contrary. He is defining 55-edo as a representation of 11-limit<br/>JI.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the 7 comma interval of &apos;LA-SI&apos;, 1. comma yields a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;diminished third&quot;, 3. comma a &quot;minor second&quot;, and<br/>&gt; &gt; 7. comma (i.e., 16. comma after the tonic) a &quot;major third&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; [27:22]. The 3. comma of the &apos;SI-DO&apos; interval compounds<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;augmented third&quot;, and a perfect fourth is achieved<br/>&gt; &gt; at the 23. comma [4:3].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh no ... now things are really getting muddled, unless<br/>&gt; i just don&apos;t understand Murat&apos;s divisions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If &quot;LA-SI&quot; means the interval from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, i can&apos;t<br/>&gt; figure out why he&apos;s dividing it into 7 commas instead<br/>&gt; of 8 or 9.<br/>&gt;</p><p>For good reason. He is attaining a neutral third between G-B. This is in<br/>accordance with the Arabic rendition of Maqam Rast, which we Turks also<br/>execute at times, but fail to acknowledge.</p><p>&gt; In 53-edo-as-pythagorean, the &quot;major second&quot; or &quot;whole tone&quot;<br/>&gt; will always be &quot;9.comma&quot;. In 53-edo-as-JI, the interval<br/>&gt; can contain varying numbers of commas depending on exactly<br/>&gt; which ratio is being considered. But even at that, the<br/>&gt; ratios being considered would normally be 9:8 (= &quot;9.comma&quot;)<br/>&gt; or 10:9 (= &quot;8.comma&quot;). The only &quot;major second&quot; in 5-limit JI<br/>&gt; which corresponds to &quot;7.comma&quot; in 53-edo is the ratio<br/>&gt; 800:729 = 2-3-5-monzo [* -6, 2&gt; (~16.09 cents), which<br/>&gt; as you can see from the monzo is quite far from the origin.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are consigning JI to 5-limit. This is not the case for Maqam Music.<br/>Remember Murat&apos;s remarks on cacophony.</p><p>&gt; The &quot;7.comma&quot; of &quot;LA-SI&quot;, &quot;16.comma after the tonic&quot;,<br/>&gt; indeed does not correspond to the typical 5-limit JI<br/>&gt; ratios. The pythagorean &quot;major third&quot; of ratio 81:64<br/>&gt; is &quot;18.comma&quot; (~407.55 cents) in 53-edo, and the JI<br/>&gt; &quot;major third&quot; of 5:4 ratio is &quot;17.comma&quot; (~384.91 cents).<br/>&gt; The &quot;16.comma&quot; (~362.26 cents) certainly is much closer<br/>&gt; to the 27:22 ratio which you interpolated into the quote<br/>&gt; from Murat</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Murat *does* mean 55-edo, then he seems to be using<br/>&gt; it not only as a meantone representation of 5-limit JI,<br/>&gt; but rather to represent 11-limit JI, which seems to be<br/>&gt; the interpretation you yourself understood him to mean.<br/>&gt; The 55-edo &quot;16.comma&quot; (~349.09 cents) does give a very<br/>&gt; good representation not only of 27:22 as you note, but<br/>&gt; also of the 11:9 &quot;neutral third&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I hadn&apos;t thought of that one. Good for you.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for &quot;1.comma&quot; of &quot;LA-SI&quot;: the JI &quot;diminished third&quot;<br/>&gt; represented in 53-edo by &quot;10.comma&quot; (~226.42 cents) is the<br/>&gt; closest one to the lattice origin, with ratio 256:225 =<br/>&gt; 2-3-5-monzo [* -2, -2&gt;. There is another one just a bit<br/>&gt; farther at ratio 144:125 which is represented by &quot;11.comma&quot;,<br/>&gt; but Murat&apos;s description of &quot;1.comma&quot; in &quot;LA-SI&quot; shows that<br/>&gt; he is referring to &quot;10.comma&quot; after the tonic. So this<br/>&gt; interval description seems clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If he does mean 55-edo, the &quot;10.comma&quot; (~218.18 cents)<br/>&gt; actually does represent the -10 generator-5th &quot;diminished<br/>&gt; third&quot; of 55-edo.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Agreeably so. He is a Europeanized Turk after all.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; His description of 3.comma of &quot;LA-SI&quot;, which is 12.comma<br/>&gt; after the tonic, as &quot;minor second&quot; makes no sense -- i<br/>&gt; believe this must be a typo for &quot;minor third&quot;.</p><p>I concur.</p><p>However,<br/>&gt; as with the &quot;7.comma&quot; above, this one also seems to be<br/>&gt; one comma too narrow. In 53-edo, the JI &quot;minor third&quot;<br/>&gt; of ratio 6:5 is represented by &quot;14.comma&quot; (~316.98 cents),<br/>&gt; and the pythagorean &quot;minor third&quot; of ratio 32:27 is<br/>&gt; &quot;13.comma&quot; (~294.34 cents). The &quot;12.comma&quot; is only<br/>&gt; ~271.7 cents.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The septimal minor third, yes. He definitely means 7:6.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And again, with the &quot;augmented third&quot;, the closest one<br/>&gt; in JI is ratio 125:96 = 2-3-5-monzo [* -1, 3&gt;, but this<br/>&gt; is represented in 53-edo by &quot;20.comma&quot; (~452.83 cents)<br/>&gt; and according to Murat it should be 16+3 = &quot;19.comma&quot;<br/>&gt; after the tonic (~430.19 cents).<br/>&gt;</p><p>He implies the septimal major third at 9:7. Deviation from the original<br/>nomenclature is again understandable, since any other definition would have<br/>little musical meaning. 9:7 is a third, and larger than 11:9, hence the term<br/>&quot;augmented&quot;.</p><p>&gt; It looks here as if he either using 53-edo to refer<br/>&gt; to some intervals which are from a prime-limit higher<br/>&gt; than 5, or else maybe using a multiple-division. If<br/>&gt; it&apos;s the latter, then he seems to be assuming a 5-limit<br/>&gt; JI basis for the tetrachord and dividing the 9:8 into<br/>&gt; 9 commas, which corresponds to 53-edo, and the 10:9<br/>&gt; into 7 commas, which corresponds to 46-edo: (10/9)^(1/7)<br/>&gt; is ~26.06 cents, and the EDO which has a step-size close<br/>&gt; to this is 46-edo.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Such complicated procedures are unheard of in Maqam Music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The II. tetrachord is divided similar to the I tetrachord.<br/>&gt; &gt; The two tetrachords are in exact symmetry with each other.<br/>&gt; &gt; The &apos;DO-RE&apos; major tone interval that seperates the two<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachords is divided into smaller intervals of 1,3,5 commas<br/>&gt; &gt; just like the intervals of &apos;SOL-LA&apos; and &apos;RE-MI&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt; The tonic of the II. tetrachord forms the fifth of the I.<br/>&gt; &gt; There are 32 commas in this pentachord. In the entirety of<br/>&gt; &gt; the composite tetrachords made of the union of two disjunct<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachords, there are 55 commas. As may be seen, amid each<br/>&gt; &gt; of the 7 intervals forming the octave, there are 3<br/>&gt; &gt; intermediate tones. Via the division of the primary intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; into three, it is observed that there are 21 intervals and<br/>&gt; &gt; 22 perdes in the Turkish octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, after spending most of my free time today working<br/>&gt; on this, at this point i give up. What Murat says here<br/>&gt; clearly refers to 55-edo. So i&apos;m not sure what&apos;s going<br/>&gt; on at those points where i earlier wrote that 55-edo<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t fit his description and he must be referring to<br/>&gt; 53-edo. I guess i&apos;ll leave it to you to work out the<br/>&gt; discrepancies.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hopefully, I have clarified for you the situation. Surely if 79/80 MOS<br/>159-tET is unbearable, the next best thing for Maqam Music is 55-edo. And<br/>the nonsense behind the &quot;Arabian comma&quot; becomes moot. Why insist on<br/>Pythagoreanism when 11-limit JI approximation by a cyclic meantone is<br/>clearly implied?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=70739 href="#70739">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2007 2:28:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If Murat *does* mean 55-edo, then he seems to be using<br/>&gt; it not only as a meantone representation of 5-limit JI,<br/>&gt; but rather to represent 11-limit JI, which seems to be<br/>&gt; the interpretation you yourself understood him to mean.<br/>&gt; The 55-edo &quot;16.comma&quot; (~349.09 cents) does give a very<br/>&gt; good representation not only of 27:22 as you note, but<br/>&gt; also of the 11:9 &quot;neutral third&quot;.</p><p>The 16deg55 neutral third is complex if you use chains of fifths, being<br/>16/32 = 1/2 = -27 fifths, as complex as is possible.
