There&apos;s something<br/>about it in the liner notes.  Probably the same as on<br/>their website:</p><p><a href="http://www.brabantensemble.com/discography_-_Lassus.cfm">http://www.brabantensemble.com/discography_-_Lassus.cfm</a></p><p>&quot;This &apos;just intonation&apos; system usually cannot be followed<br/>precisely in performance because the demands of tuning<br/>harmonic and melodic intervals purely are in competition,<br/>and also, if observed strictly, frequently lead to the<br/>music departing from its original pitch standard; however,<br/>for the most part the system produces clearly better<br/>results than equal temperament for chordal music, and<br/>consequently, so far as is feasible, is followed here.&quot;</p><p>It seems to work.  There&apos;s a &quot;Listen now&quot; feature, may not<br/>be international.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
