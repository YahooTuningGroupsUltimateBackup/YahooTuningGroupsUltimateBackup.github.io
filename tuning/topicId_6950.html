However, as many<br/>people know, many times electronic instruments have greater functionality<br/>in their early stages... the engineers are interested in trying things, and<br/>some of them are even music and tuning enthusiasts.  Later, the marketing<br/>people throw lots of it out -- usually the tuning capabilities are the<br/>first to go -- since they are targeting the &quot;masses&quot; and want to cut<br/>&quot;unnecessary&quot; costs!</p><p>Some of the patches on the TX81Z are truly excellent.  I get some better<br/>orchestral instrumental sounds than a friend who has LOTS of synthesizer<br/>equipment.  I get a better oboe, bassoon, clarinet, French horn and<br/>trumpet.  OK, the strings aren&apos;t so great -- but by and large, the sounds<br/>are quite good -- if, that is, you are interested in orchestral instrument<br/>emulation...</p><p>As far as the tuning is concerned, there are 11 preset tunings and 2<br/>user-definable tunings.</p><p>Of the presets:<br/>1)Equal<br/>2) Pure (major) [set key]<br/>3) Pure (minor) [set key]</p><p>Now, these two &quot;pure&quot; tunings seem to be some kind of approximate just<br/>intonation.  I am not certain what limit, and have not yet done the<br/>calculations to determine this...  If anyone out there in the &quot;blue yonder&quot;<br/>knows more about this feature of the TX81Z than I do, please &quot;chime&quot; in...</p><p>These &quot;pure&quot; tunings, as they should, can be set from a starting point of<br/>any &quot;key,&quot; ie. C, Cb, D, etc.  The &quot;minor&quot; variants of this look like<br/>pretty much the same kinds of tuning, from different starting points...</p><p>Frankly, when I was working with just intonation, I set my own tuning...</p><p>4) Mean tone [set key]</p><p>Whew... this is easy by comparison.  It&apos;s pretty easy to see what this<br/>is...</p><p>5) Pythagorean [set key]</p><p>This tuning &quot;adjusts&quot; fifths so they come out pure(er) than equal.  They<br/>don&apos;t seem to be worried much about the &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot;...  I was<br/>looking around for it...</p><p>6) Werckmeister (of course, standard and not key-setable)</p><p>7) Kirnberger (also standard)</p><p>8) Vallotti &amp; Young</p><p>9) 1/4 shift equal</p><p>This is basically the 12 note set of equal with each note transposed up 1/4<br/>tone...  This is, obviously, to be used as a &quot;foil&quot; for other &quot;instruments&quot;<br/>that are using equal</p><p>10) 1/4 tone</p><p>11) 1/8 tone</p><p>12) and 13) are the &quot;user definable&quot; tunings.  You can start off with any<br/>of the above presets (including, of course, 12t-ET) and then alter them.<br/>One &quot;user definable&quot; setting is called OCT and the other is called FULL.</p><p>For &quot;OCT&quot; each octave is tuned the same way as the 11 notes of the one<br/>octave you define.</p><p>For &quot;FULL&quot; you can set the ENTIRE keyboard to virtually ANY pitch on the<br/>sound spectrum (!!!)  How about THAT for flexibility!!</p><p>CAVEAT -- the smallest tunable unit on the TX81Z is 1.56 cents, so you have<br/>to divide all your cents alterations by that number.  I don&apos;t know if<br/>anyone here on the list can hear a 1.5 cent deviation... most people can&apos;t.<br/> Each pitch can only be tuned up or down by 32 T.U. (tuning units) which<br/>equals, therefore, 49.92 cents or the quarter-tone.  (But then the pitch<br/>above can be tuned DOWN, instead, so you can get whatever you want...)<br/>Keep in mind that any basic note can be assigned to ANY 12t-ET note within<br/>the range of the entire instrument, and then altered from there -- so<br/>virtually the entire sound span is reachable-- limited only by the number<br/>of total &quot;notes&quot; available.</p><p>When a person sets up a &quot;performance&quot; on the TX81Z, it basically means you<br/>set the number of voices available for each MIDI channel.  There are only 8<br/>voices, so there is not a lot to choose from here, unfortunately. There are<br/>are 8 possible MIDI channels, but if you use all the 8 voices on one<br/>channel, there&apos;s nothing left, etc.  Each channel can then be set to play<br/>in 12t-ET-- OR in ONE microtonal tuning -- preset or user-set.  (The<br/>alternate microtonal tuning is &quot;global&quot; for each performance set-up)</p><p>One of the limitations is that although there are possibilities for 24<br/>&quot;performance&quot; settings -- with any instruments and number of voices<br/>available on the TX81Z, there is only ONE choice per &quot;performance&quot; of a<br/>microtonal set.  It can either be one of the presets or one of the two<br/>&quot;user definable&quot; tunings...  Therefore, there can really only be one<br/>microtonal tuning per performance in addition to 12t-ET (sorry,<br/>&quot;polymicrotonalists!&quot;)  Some of the channels can be playing the microtonal<br/>tuning simultaneously with others playing 12t-ET, if anyone would<br/>conceivably want that...</p><p>Another limitation is the fact that the two user settings are &quot;global&quot; for<br/>the entire instrument, so ALL the performance set-ups use one of the two<br/>&quot;user defined&quot; tunings-- you can&apos;t have different &quot;user defined&quot; tunings<br/>that differ for each performance setting.  So, basically, a &quot;performance&quot;<br/>can have one of the 11 microtonal presets (well, actually, there are 10,<br/>since if you turn the microtonal capability off, you are in 12t-ET by<br/>default) or one of the two &quot;user defined&quot; tunings.</p><p>But really, that is a pretty small limitation.  I bought my TX81Z used for<br/>$120.  I suggest the entire microtonal community buy every existing one up<br/>and use them as &quot;currency&quot; -- a &quot;micro-Euro!&quot;</p><p>This is where I purchased mine -- I found it on the Web:</p><p><a href="http://www.themusicbrokers.com">www.themusicbrokers.com</a></p><p>The Music Brokers<br/>Phoenix, AZ<br/>(toll free) 877-MUSIC-18<br/>9:30AM - 7:00PM MST</p><p>That&apos;s all, folks.</p><p>Corrections, suggestions and illuminations would be greatly appreciated,<br/>and undoubtedly needed!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=6976 href="#6976">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/1999 4:50:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Joseph Pehrson:]<br/>&gt;Some of the channels can be playing the microtonal tuning<br/>simultaneously with others playing 12t-ET, if anyone would conceivably<br/>want that...</p><p>Ha, as I&apos;m reading this I&apos;m also listening to HUUN-HUUR-TU&apos;s<br/>_Mezhegei_, which coincidentally enough is doing just that!</p><p>Dan</p></div>
