What you are<br/>&gt; currently talking about I would call &quot;not perceptibly unjust&quot;.  But that<br/>&gt; seems different to me from &quot;perceptibly just&quot; which to me should mean that<br/>&gt; qualities associated specifically with JI (e.g. a quite distinctly audible<br/>&gt; implied fundamental) should be clearly present.  I think such qualities<br/>are<br/>&gt; distinctly present with errors of 5 or 6 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t really need to argue about which term means what, as long as there<br/>&gt; are ways to cover the different meanings.  The positive sense of<br/>perceptibly<br/>&gt; just I just described needs some way of being referred to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Kurt</p><p>Hi Kurt,<br/>Of course you&apos;re welcome to join in!   You also brought<br/>something new and relevant to the discussion, I think.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t call this &quot;not perceptibly unjust&quot;, as it&apos;s a<br/>double negative.  However, I can see why you were<br/>tempted to use such wording ... Generally, whenever we<br/>are so tempted, there&apos;s some kind of category error<br/>lurking - a case where our terms don&apos;t pose a question<br/>with just a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer.</p><p>So, if you perceive justness, because of &quot;a quite distinctly<br/>audible implied fundamental&quot;, even in the presence of<br/>mistunings as wide as 6 cents, it seems reasonable to<br/>call that a kind of &quot;perceptible justness&quot;.  I guess we<br/>haven&apos;t examined very closely that &quot;special quality&quot; of<br/>perceptibly just intonation that Dave Keenan says he<br/>can demonstrate but not define analytically.  Perhaps it<br/>IS possible, after all, to define?</p><p>So I&apos;d like to analyse what other features may be present<br/>in &quot;perceptibly just intonation&quot;.  You&apos;ve given the audible<br/>implied fundamental as an example.  Others have mentioned<br/>the lack of audible beats between overtones.  Can you name<br/>any others?</p><p>And could you have perceptibly just intonation _without_<br/>any of those features; is any feature _necessary_?</p><p>Finally, do we care only about the presence or absence of<br/>a feature, or do we care to what extent we can perceive<br/>that feature?  That is, are we ticking boxes or are we<br/>taking measurements?</p><p>These questions are, of course open for anyone to opine<br/>on ...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
