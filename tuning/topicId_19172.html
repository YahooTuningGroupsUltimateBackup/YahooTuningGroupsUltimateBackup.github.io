(??)</p><p>[Bill Alves:]<br/>&gt;Not by me. This is exactly the sort of illusion of consensus that Kraig<br/>&gt;was referring to.</p><p>OK, but what better way to make it clear that there&apos;s not a complete<br/>consensus than to undertake this FAQ?  I definitely agree with the idea<br/>of making it clear that a term does not have universally accepted<br/>meaning when this is the case.</p><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;I think there is a lot of bias showing in the making of this FAQ and it<br/>&gt;makes me uncomfortable.  Surely there is no need to slander<br/>&gt;quartertones per Ivor Darreg, et al.  Haven&apos;t we progressed passed<br/>&gt;that.  Isn&apos;t it irrefutable that there are wonderful compositions<br/>&gt;utilizing quartertones?</p><p>&gt;It could get very personal if we start attacking here and there...but<br/>&gt;the differences may be very real.  It reminds me that Schoenberg held<br/>&gt;that his music was pantonal, despite the reality that the media would<br/>&gt;insist it is atonal.</p><p>Fair enough - you&apos;re referring to the suggested topic WHY QUARTERTONES<br/>ARE NOT SO INTERESTING, which perhaps was originally made partly in<br/>jest.  I agree that it should not be included.  Something slightly<br/>different, say &quot;Why quartertones don&apos;t help achieve Just Intonation&quot;,<br/>might be more acceptable, and informative.</p><p>[Johnny:]<br/>&gt;I still feel, in the center of my being, that microtonal intervals can<br/>&gt;also be larger intervals than intervals &quot;smaller than a semitone.&quot;  And<br/>&gt;yet I know others teach differently.  Maybe it&apos;s a better idea to<br/>&gt;simply point to different web sites that are clearer in their biases.<br/>&gt;This list needs to remain tolerant of differences, IMHO.</p><p>Agreed.  When a term has meanings that are different among different<br/>camps, multiple links to multiple definitions sounds like the perfect<br/>solution.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, Daniel Wolf&apos;s definition of meantones<br/>will be very helpful, do you not think?  And there are a multitude of<br/>other topics, controversial or not, that a newcomer would well benefit<br/>from seeing definitions of on first entering the list.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2001 11:45:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Without a doubt, a tuning FAQ is an excellent idea as I think back a year or so to how much I as a<br/>composer, performer and teacher of music would have gained from the outset had one been available.<br/>Perhaps if there was more focus on the benefits to the newbie of an FAQ, a start could be made.<br/>And facts are surely facts l so at least these could be given till the opinions have been settled.<br/>If the experts (I mean this sincerely) cannot agree on a definition of Just Intonation then say<br/>so. After all the greatest minds in physics were unable to reconcile macro- and micro-theories<br/>until string theory came along.</p><p>I would be in favour of taking a stance in a FAQ by explaining how revolutionary all non-12<br/>systems are in the established musical/commercial western context and perhaps laying out the<br/>inconsistencies and limitations of 12 tet. A good rant or two from Ivor Darreg whom I greatly<br/>admire would help here. After all, that&apos;s what we&apos;re about, n&apos;est-ce pas? I think it would also be<br/>beneficial to point newbies to recordings or web-based pieces. A lot can become clear with a few<br/>minutes listening and although I take it for granted that I can access all sorts of pieces in<br/>various tunings now I was a bit unsure as to what was going on last year in microtonal/JI music.</p><p>Finally, although this is a lot of work (I offer my assistance if I can be of any) I would stress<br/>to newcomers that there is a lot of reprogramming necessary , a fair bit of musical<br/>broad-mindedness needed and certainly an effort required to learn more than just the basics of<br/>mathematics.</p><p>But most of all, let&apos;s be charitable to the next generation of potential microtonalists.</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@matavnet.hu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2001 2:38:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Several points:</p><p>(1) Controversies over nomenclature should simply be left controversial.

I hope that Keenan will reconsider on<br/>CONSONANCE-DISSONANCE MEASURES.</p><p>Dan Stearns -</p><p>You&apos;ve made some excellent suggestions. However, the terms MICROTONE and<br/>MICROTONALITY should probably stay off the FAQ, as consensus on these has long<br/>proven impossible.  This is, officially, &quot;The Alternative Tunings List&quot;, and<br/>that still seems as neutral a term as possible.</p><p>To all:</p><p>(1) Do you feel that discussing each proposed FAQ item on the list will be<br/>useful and interesting? Should it be moved off-list, either (a) to a separate<br/>list, or (b) to post drafts to the list files web page, announce the posting to<br/>the list, and then direct any responses to the writer by offlist emails.</p><p>(2) How will we know when a FAQ item is ready for publication? In the absence of<br/>an editor with authority to make this judgement, perhaps the the following<br/>process could be adapted to indicate consent from the group:  Following the<br/>posting of a draft, group discussions, corrections by the author, and a<br/>breathing space of a week or so, any member of the list may nominate the item<br/>for inclusion in the FAQ, simply by sending an email to the list with the words<br/>&quot;I nominate &quot;WHAT IS X&quot;.  At this point, any list member may object to<br/>publication (a consensus principle).  The objection, however, must be in the<br/>form of a substitute draft (a &quot;put up or shut up&quot; principle). The author of the<br/>original draft now has the opportunity to withdraw in favor of the substitute,<br/>to seek some compromise with the objector, offlist, or to stand firm on the<br/>original draft. If both parties remain firm about their differences, they can<br/>agree to neutral and binding arbitrator, or they can agree to publish both<br/>items, or they can agree to withdraw both items, or, only after failing all of<br/>these options, they can submit the two drafts to a poll of the list membership.</p><p>(3) Final editing of the items into a single FAQ document. This is where we<br/>should seek -- a la Joseph Pehrson -- an editor. The above procedure is designed<br/>to find consensus on content, but when it comes to compiling the document for<br/>publication, I believe we can agree to accept an autocrat. This person should<br/>have HTML fluency, and access to an English language spelling and grammar<br/>checker.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2001 3:45:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;However, the terms MICROTONE<br/>and<br/>&gt; MICROTONALITY should probably stay off the FAQ, as consensus on<br/>these has long<br/>&gt; proven impossible.</p><p>I think that newbies will definitely see these terms used and want to<br/>know what they mean.
