Playing any other guitar only complements<br/>&gt; your work on this guitar.</p><p>Very much agreed.  The cross reference is good for your fingers.  One thing<br/>I noticed after awhile, I&apos;d wind up playing something more and more out,<br/>more and more squawky for any one particular temperament, only to find out I<br/>really wanted to play in a different one, and in translating what I was<br/>doing to another, found it a normal structure all over again.  Use, perturb,<br/>adjust.</p><p>Always felt abyssmal looking &quot;up&quot; the numbers.  Like 19 is so much higher<br/>than 12, 31 is SO much higher than 19 - you can get that feeling.  Then one<br/>day I was playing 94 for a long time and *then* went *down* to 31 and it was<br/>a completely different sense of application.  There was already a more dense<br/>emotional pad built up by having played so high, so the reactions to any one<br/>note were a little bit different etc.</p><p>The more you play higher temperaments, the easier you&apos;ll find it and by the<br/>time you get back down you can fly all over the place.  Corollary?  If you<br/>keep playing lower temperaments, by the time you get back up there, you have<br/>more ideas, more to do scale wise etc.  And so on.</p><p>How&apos;s that for a positive attitude builder.</p><p>&quot;Shoot high, aim low.&quot;  ;X</p><p>m</p></div><h3>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2002 11:07:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    From: &quot;David Beardsley&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:davidbeardsley@biink.com">davidbeardsley@biink.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: First Impressions : 31ED2 G&amp;L arrives<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Robert C Valentine&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM">BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...its crowded, strings too light (probably 009, 010 at most),<br/>&gt; &gt; some fret-buzz and fret-out on bending (but why bend...).

I should probably have posted over in microtones and<br/>MakeMicro but... Before I raise the action I&apos;m going to try a larger<br/>string gauge, which may make things better (or worse) but I&apos;m still<br/>very much in the early experiment stage regarding tone, playing style<br/>etc...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Nice tone with and without amp (I expected this). I got the<br/>&gt; &gt; ASAT with the big square pickups which aren&apos;t really P90 but are<br/>&gt; &gt; still big warm single coils.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I remember correctly: Swamp ash body?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes. I ordered an S-3, which had three of the &quot;P90-ish&quot; pickups but<br/>it was discontinued, so its just got two. I didn&apos;t get a maple cap<br/>or an f-hole, I wanted a big slab of swamp ash. It really does sound<br/>nice. I can&apos;t remember if there is an option on the fretboard, I got<br/>rosewood with the flattest radius and it feels and sounds great.</p><p>I may have a minor electrical mod done at some point. There is a<br/>4-way switch on some telecaster models that puts the pickups in<br/>series in the fourth position for a &quot;fat middle position tone&quot;. Couple<br/>this with a push/pull pot to put the bridge pickup out of phase and<br/>then that fourth position tone will be a rather &quot;fat squack&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your comments make me want one, I&apos;ve tried Jon Catlers<br/>&gt; 31tet classical a few times. Interesting...<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m still groping with &quot;how&quot; to approach learning it, in so many ways<br/>its like going back to the beginning. So I think for the next week or<br/>so it will really be like the stuff I did when learning my modes years<br/>ago, pick a position, pick a mode, improvise (which probably will get<br/>into some middle ground between just playing the color tones and expressing<br/>the mode), shift position, continue...  Next day, new key, new mode...<br/>Also single string playing, two string playing, etc... Basically all<br/>the excercises in Mick Goodricks book...</p><p>In the middle of one of these modal things it is really tempting to<br/>get a few strings ringing together and just folk-pick a pretty voicing,<br/>very nice morning music. But theres crunch in there too...</p><p>Thanks for your comments.</p><p>&gt;    From: &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@orphonsoul.com">tuning@orphonsoul.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: First Impressions : 31ED2 G&amp;L arrives<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 2/24/02 9:15 AM, &quot;Robert C Valentine&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM">BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; chords are hard, (but yes, they are in tune) but Im always a bit<br/>&gt; &gt; more into melody so, I&apos;ll get there...

I don&apos;t look at the fingerboard when I play in 12 (unless what I&apos;m<br/>playing is significantly shifted from what I had been hearing in my head),<br/>so looking and then seeing a zillion frets (yeah, giant hands) is<br/>disorienting. Its a strange process &quot;up five frets from index finger? use<br/>pinky... hey! thats only a major second I should be going to my middle<br/>finger!&quot; If I don&apos;t look, my hands do there normal things and things make<br/>sense, for about three notes....</p><p>thanks,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 12:26:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Heres a ramble after about five days with my new guitar. microtonal<br/>&gt; guitarists feel free to jump in and offer advice!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...its crowded, strings too light (probably 009, 010 at most),<br/>&gt; some fret-buzz and fret-out on bending (but why bend...).
