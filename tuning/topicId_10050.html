If the holes had circular top views and<br/>were the same width as the bore, they&apos;d come down halfway on both sides,<br/>like a saddle.&quot;</p><p>exactly, their not really holes anymore, they&apos;re slices out of the side of<br/>the flute.  That&apos;s the limiting case where the shortened air column acts as<br/>if it were a tube without holes.  But, as you said, you can&apos;t work the<br/>holes with you&apos;re fingers anymore and you&apos;d need some kind of key mechanism<br/>(but with a flute long enough to get higher harmonics you can&apos;t reach the<br/>holes anyway, unless it&apos;s a piccollo range.)  I&apos;ve been playing with the<br/>idea of a flute like this designed to play harmonics 4 - 8 on each hole,<br/>and it works beautifully except that my mechanical abilities stop where the<br/>key mechanism comes in.  Anyway, this is probably getting remote from your<br/>own project . . .</p></div>
