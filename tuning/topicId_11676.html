Most pieces of music don&apos;t need 12 perfect fifths,<br/>but since the diatonic scale has 6 consecutive perfect fifths, even a simple<br/>piece encounters these syntonic comma problems in spades.</p></div><h3><a id=11685 href="#11685">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@apple.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2000 6:12:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul H.
