This is sort of<br/>an extension into JI from diatonic theory, a lot of it incorporating<br/>Paul Erlich&apos;s ideas on the matter.</p><p>All of the diatonic modes blend into one another, and yet they all<br/>have their own sound which uniquely identifies them in pitch space. In<br/>12-tet, if you temper out 81/80, there is a definite and real pattern<br/>existing in the circle of fifths that ends up generating all of the<br/>modes, and correlates so well with the feeling of each one that you<br/>might actually think that the modes really ARE generated entirely by<br/>meantone fifths. So how can we apply this to a JI context, where other<br/>intervals than the perfect fifth can be used as well?</p><p>Let&apos;s roll with D dorian for a second.</p><p>D E F G A B C D</p><p>That B has two distinct uses that differ by a syntonic comma, and the<br/>two uses are very, very, very musically different. Having the B down a<br/>comma (B\) leads to progressions like ||: Dm7 G7 :|| and having the B<br/>comma-neutral (B|//|) leads to progressions like ||: Dm7 Em7 Fmaj7#11<br/>Em7 :||. That is to say, that having the B up a comma makes it a<br/>beautiful and haunting consonance which is usually explored as being 3<br/>fifths above the B, and having the B down a comma leads to a more<br/>mellow kind of relaxed sound. But they are both a part of what most<br/>people would term &quot;Dorian mode.&quot;</p><p>Furthermore, there are plenty of times when other notes will have to<br/>differ by a comma as well for various reasons, in all of the diatonic<br/>scale modes. So I was thinking that in order to get a really<br/>&quot;extended&quot; mode that can be used to get all sorts of feelings and<br/>flavors, perhaps it might be best to describe dorian just in terms of<br/>the JI intervals corresponding to the notes D E F G A B C D, and allow<br/>any of the commas be adjusted as they will. Let the B go up or down a<br/>comma, as well as the E; hell, let the D even go up or down a comma if<br/>needed. Furthermore, if we allow septimal comma drift as well, it&apos;s<br/>possible to let the generic dorian template &quot;drift outward&quot; into<br/>7-limit space in a very natural and intuitive manner.</p><p>(Is this the same thing, using tuning-math terminology, as declaring<br/>the mode to be whatever JI equivalent intervals D E F G A B C D work<br/>out to be, and then treating it as a periodicity block with 81/80 and<br/>64/63 as unison vectors?)</p><p>It&apos;s almost like the modes are just a focusing in of a lens on some<br/>kind of a pitch mapping continuum; they are not isolated, discrete<br/>units, but rather the lines are blurry. In the sense that the modes<br/>are used in modern music, they just seem to be baseline generators in<br/>which any of the notes can drift by a comma to produce different<br/>effects.</p><p>One interesting thing to note is that this ability of the notes in the<br/>modes to drift by commas extends to larger intervals as well. For<br/>example, take the chord progression Fm9 Gbmaj9 Fm9. Having the Fm9 as<br/>a minor ninth chord means there&apos;s a G in there, whereas the next chord<br/>has a Gb, so in terms of &quot;diatonic scale theory,&quot; it does seem like<br/>the mode is switching. And yet, this chord progression sounds<br/>completely diatonic, so you could view it as a larger type of &quot;comma<br/>adjustment&quot; given the context that these notes are used.</p><p>If you aren&apos;t content allowing notes in a mode to differ by a full<br/>semitone, then note the following: the G and the Gb differ by a<br/>135/128 chroma, which is not quite the same thing as a chromatic<br/>semitone. If you construct a scale that repeats every 2 octaves, you<br/>can stick that interval in there to get an expanded version of an<br/>existing mode. It&apos;s just like you&apos;re defocusing the lens on the modal<br/>spectrum slightly, and increasing the scope of what you&apos;re looking at.<br/>In this way,  you can derive the following &quot;expanded modal&quot; scale for<br/>Phrygian:</p><p>C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb F G A Bb C</p><p>Note this scale repeats every 2 octaves, and was generated by taking<br/>this tetrachord:</p><p>| C Db Eb F |</p><p>And tiling it like so:</p><p>| C Db Eb F | G Ab Bb C | D Eb F G | A Bb C | (D)</p><p>Which contains all of the intervals in the Fm9 Gbmaj9 chord<br/>progression above. I haven&apos;t come up with an exact science for these<br/>2-octave scales yet, generally doing them by ear and finding patterns<br/>along the way, but maybe they&apos;ll be musically interesting when the<br/>concept is applied to microtonal scales.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77892 href="#77892">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2008 4:20:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Interesting ideas Mike;</p><p>You have prompted (inspired?) me to add more scales to my ScaleCoding database to cover what you are suggesting:</p><p>I have put a pdf of the new version (680) into this folder:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/scales/">http://www.lucytune.com/scales/</a></p><p>Or directly as:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/scales/ScaleCoding680UniqueScales.pdf">http://www.lucytune.com/scales/ScaleCoding680UniqueScales.pdf</a></p><p>I&apos;ll update it in the other formats, when I get time;-)</p><p>Here is how I visualise what you are proposing:</p><p>For your selected notes of:</p><p>&gt; C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb F G A Bb C</p><p>scalecoding is&quot;</p><p>Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A</p><p>all used in two octaves:</p><p>i.e. 8/0/6</p><p>&gt; Note this scale repeats every 2 octaves, and was generated by taking<br/>&gt; this tetrachord:</p><p>&gt; | C Db Eb F |</p><p>tetrachord is:</p><p>Db-x-Eb-x-F-C</p><p>i.e.</p><p>5/24/6</p><p>&gt; And tiling it like so:</p><p>&gt; | C Db Eb F | G Ab Bb C | D Eb F G | A Bb C | (D)</p><p>All notes used is:</p><p>Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A</p><p> i.e. 8/0/6 if  C is tonic</p><p>or</p><p>8/0/8 is D is tonic</p><p>first octave is;</p><p> C Db Eb F | G Ab Bb C</p><p>Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G</p><p>6/0/6</p><p>second octave is:</p><p>C | D Eb F G | A Bb C |</p><p>Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D =</p><p>5/0/6 if D is tonic</p><p>or</p><p>5/0/4 if C is tonic.</p><p>On 2 Jul 2008, at 19:34, Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was just thinking about the diatonic scale modes...
