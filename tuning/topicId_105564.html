However, such an interpretation can result in ridiculously large frequency ratios. For example, let&apos;s take the m7b5 chord from the undertone series:</p><p>1:1 7:6 7:5 7:4 (starting from the lowest note), or<br/>7:6 6:5 5:4 (subsequent intervals)</p><p>This is basically a mirrored variant of the 4:5:6:7 overtone chord, so the same simple 7-limit ratios occur between the notes: 5:4, 6:5, 7:6, 3:2, 7:5 and 7:4.</p><p>However, as opposed to the 4:5:6:7 overtone chord, the most simple overtone interpretation of this m7b5 chord is very complex: 60:70:84:105.

Not a popular thing to say on a tuning group!  I&quot;m sort of in both camps.  People like Richard Parncutt feel that intervals are perceived linearly, in semitones, and not as frequency ratios.  (He has a chapter on this in his harmony book.)   My theory is that intervals which, as measured in semitones, divide evenly into the octave and which have multiple &apos;frequency&apos; spellings (m3, M3, and M2, which are the source of dim, aug, and whole tone, which have powerful tonal properties!)...that those intervals are perceived linearly, like he says.  But that P5 is a frequency ratio interval, because it is a large interval which occurs in the harmonic series (as the intervals get smaller) before the intervals get more ambiguous in terms of which frequency ratio they represent, as well as the tonal fact of small interval dissonance from symmetrical chords (M3-M3-M3; m3-m3-m3-m3) and roughness (M2-M2...; m2-m2...)   That leaves the question of how to classify P4, M6, and M7...but since it doesn&apos;t involve tuning math, there may be no interest in that here!   cheers, Kelly</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sat, Dec 22, 2012 at 2:00 AM, Freeman Gilmore &lt;freeman.gilmore@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think that the root of a chord is determined by the virtual<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fundamental.

My only point was that the details of such a process are<br/>non-trivial.</p><p>Anecdotally, I&apos;ve noticed that this specific thing does happen for me,<br/>especially in decent 11-limit tunings where there are lots of dyads<br/>that by themselves are rather discordant and inharmonic sounding, but<br/>which suddenly come to life in the context of a larger chord. 11/8<br/>used to sound like crap by itself, but after playing in porcupine so<br/>much, it&apos;s hard for me to hear that dyad and NOT imagine it as part of<br/>a whole bunch of larger &quot;otonal&quot; sounding chords like 8:9:10:11:12.</p><p>I never heard any of the above until I bought my AXiS and my 22-EDO<br/>guitar though. 9/7 and 11/8 used to just sound like crap; it&apos;s only<br/>after playing around in porcupine and with 11-limit harmony a lot that<br/>the whole thing has changed. It&apos;s really nothing psychoacoustic and<br/>mysterious; it&apos;s like the equivalent of playing C-Eb-Bb in 12-EDO and<br/>imagining a &quot;G&quot; or something, making it a minor seventh chord, just<br/>with all of these new 11-limit chords. It&apos;s not really like I&apos;m<br/>imagining VFs directly or what have you, more that I&apos;m just imagining<br/>other notes as existing in &quot;the current scale&quot; or something, and then<br/>remembering the sound of the chord formed by those imagined notes and<br/>the ones I&apos;m playing now. Hopefully that seems direct and simple<br/>enough.</p><p>I&apos;ve also had the same experience with 9/7, which now always &quot;reminds<br/>me&quot; of 4:7:9; it sounds much less &quot;harsh&quot; that way. I would be very<br/>surprised if it were just completely random that imagining the root of<br/>9/7 as &quot;4&quot;, vs any other possible note in the vicinity, makes the<br/>whole thing sound less harsh.</p><p>So perhaps this is anecdotal evidence in favor of the thing you laid<br/>out above. I wonder if something like that is the same basic concept<br/>as imagining triadic harmony during a two-part invention, and if the<br/>whole thing falls under the heading of &quot;habitually imagined notes&quot; or<br/>something like that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think that the root of a chord is determined by the<br/>&gt; &gt; virtual fundamental. For instance, it&apos;s pretty easy to hear<br/>&gt; &gt; the root of 5:6:9 as &quot;5&quot;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t disagree, but we need to know what the virtual<br/>&gt; fundamental of a chord would even be, don&apos;t we?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assuming there&apos;s no hierarchical analysis going on<br/>&gt; (and there almost certainly is), a chord&apos;s spectrum still<br/>&gt; looks a lot different than the spectrum of its tones,<br/>&gt; even in JI...</p><p>What do you mean by a heirarchical analysis, exactly?</p><p>I used to think that 8:12:16:19, or 16:19:24, or whatever might be<br/>somehow related to the sound of minor, at least when the root is heard<br/>as the lowest note in the triad. I figured that the same sort of<br/>conditioning process I laid out above for 11/8 and 9/7 could suggest<br/>such a result. By itself, 16:19:24 is complex, but if you&apos;re imagining<br/>other notes in the bass, then you might get something like<br/>4:8:12:16:19:24, which is less complex than 5:10:15:20:24:30, and if<br/>you decide to imagine notes even further down in the bass, then it<br/>gets even less complex.</p><p>I originally started thinking along those lines because I noted above<br/>that 9/7 sounds much more consonant (not concordant, but consonant) if<br/>I imagine the root as &quot;4&quot;; in general, I doubt that this is some<br/>random coincidence that this particular choice of imagined note in the<br/>bass would transform the sound so dramatically vs imagining any other<br/>random note in the bass. It&apos;s likely that 4:7:9 has something to do<br/>with it, whether because of some past memory of hearing 4:7:9 or<br/>because of some more &quot;direct&quot; thing or whatever. I figured the same<br/>could apply to minor, when the lowest note is heard as the root, and<br/>8:12:16:19 or 16:19:24 chords.</p><p>However, the fact that something as far out as 225 cents in 16-EDO can<br/>sound like minor, at least to some people, would appear to cast a lot<br/>of doubt on that theory, or at least raise a lot of questions about<br/>how that could work...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105619 href="#105619">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2012 2:02:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; we need to know what the virtual<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamental of a chord would even be, don&apos;t we?<br/>&gt; &gt; Assuming there&apos;s no hierarchical analysis going on<br/>&gt; &gt; (and there almost certainly is), a chord&apos;s spectrum still<br/>&gt; &gt; looks a lot different than the spectrum of its tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; even in JI...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by a heirarchical analysis, exactly?</p><p>A process that analyses subsets of the stimulus (per<br/>frequency band, say, or per scene-located source) and then<br/>applies a similar analysis to the results, would be<br/>hierarchical.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=105626 href="#105626">ðŸ”—</a>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2012 10:22:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by this, exactly?

My only point was that the details of such a process are<br/>&gt; non-trivial.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anecdotally, I&apos;ve noticed that this specific thing does happen for me,<br/>&gt; especially in decent 11-limit tunings where there are lots of dyads<br/>&gt; that by themselves are rather discordant and inharmonic sounding, but<br/>&gt; which suddenly come to life in the context of a larger chord. 11/8<br/>&gt; used to sound like crap by itself, but after playing in porcupine so<br/>&gt; much, it&apos;s hard for me to hear that dyad and NOT imagine it as part of<br/>&gt; a whole bunch of larger &quot;otonal&quot; sounding chords like 8:9:10:11:12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never heard any of the above until I bought my AXiS and my 22-EDO<br/>&gt; guitar though. 9/7 and 11/8 used to just sound like crap; it&apos;s only<br/>&gt; after playing around in porcupine and with 11-limit harmony a lot that<br/>&gt; the whole thing has changed. It&apos;s really nothing psychoacoustic and<br/>&gt; mysterious; it&apos;s like the equivalent of playing C-Eb-Bb in 12-EDO and<br/>&gt; imagining a &quot;G&quot; or something, making it a minor seventh chord, just<br/>&gt; with all of these new 11-limit chords. It&apos;s not really like I&apos;m<br/>&gt; imagining VFs directly or what have you, more that I&apos;m just imagining<br/>&gt; other notes as existing in &quot;the current scale&quot; or something, and then<br/>&gt; remembering the sound of the chord formed by those imagined notes and<br/>&gt; the ones I&apos;m playing now. Hopefully that seems direct and simple<br/>&gt; enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve also had the same experience with 9/7, which now always &quot;reminds<br/>&gt; me&quot; of 4:7:9; it sounds much less &quot;harsh&quot; that way. I would be very<br/>&gt; surprised if it were just completely random that imagining the root of<br/>&gt; 9/7 as &quot;4&quot;, vs any other possible note in the vicinity, makes the<br/>&gt; whole thing sound less harsh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So perhaps this is anecdotal evidence in favor of the thing you laid<br/>&gt; out above. I wonder if something like that is the same basic concept<br/>&gt; as imagining triadic harmony during a two-part invention, and if the<br/>&gt; whole thing falls under the heading of &quot;habitually imagined notes&quot; or<br/>&gt; something like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think that the root of a chord is determined by the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; virtual fundamental. For instance, it&apos;s pretty easy to hear<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the root of 5:6:9 as &quot;5&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t disagree, but we need to know what the virtual<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamental of a chord would even be, don&apos;t we?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Assuming there&apos;s no hierarchical analysis going on<br/>&gt; &gt; (and there almost certainly is), a chord&apos;s spectrum still<br/>&gt; &gt; looks a lot different than the spectrum of its tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; even in JI...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by a heirarchical analysis, exactly?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I used to think that 8:12:16:19, or 16:19:24, or whatever might be<br/>&gt; somehow related to the sound of minor, at least when the root is heard<br/>&gt; as the lowest note in the triad. I figured that the same sort of<br/>&gt; conditioning process I laid out above for 11/8 and 9/7 could suggest<br/>&gt; such a result. By itself, 16:19:24 is complex, but if you&apos;re imagining<br/>&gt; other notes in the bass, then you might get something like<br/>&gt; 4:8:12:16:19:24, which is less complex than 5:10:15:20:24:30, and if<br/>&gt; you decide to imagine notes even further down in the bass, then it<br/>&gt; gets even less complex.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I originally started thinking along those lines because I noted above<br/>&gt; that 9/7 sounds much more consonant (not concordant, but consonant) if<br/>&gt; I imagine the root as &quot;4&quot;; in general, I doubt that this is some<br/>&gt; random coincidence that this particular choice of imagined note in the<br/>&gt; bass would transform the sound so dramatically vs imagining any other<br/>&gt; random note in the bass. It&apos;s likely that 4:7:9 has something to do<br/>&gt; with it, whether because of some past memory of hearing 4:7:9 or<br/>&gt; because of some more &quot;direct&quot; thing or whatever. I figured the same<br/>&gt; could apply to minor, when the lowest note is heard as the root, and<br/>&gt; 8:12:16:19 or 16:19:24 chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the fact that something as far out as 225 cents in 16-EDO can<br/>&gt; sound like minor, at least to some people, would appear to cast a lot<br/>&gt; of doubt on that theory, or at least raise a lot of questions about<br/>&gt; how that could work...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>I find what is said by Carl and Mike, interesting; because what they [as<br/>well as others of this thread] have said about the roots of chords, fits<br/>with much of my thoughts.</p><p>I would like to add my 3 cents about chords and roots.   I am somewhat new<br/>to the group.  I do not have the advantage of all that has been said on<br/>this subject in the past; so feedback would be appreciated.</p><p>I see a chord as nothing more than a group of intervals.  Trying to place<br/>all the notes in a harmonic series of a remote, lower note [root]; is an<br/>exercise in futility.   If the notes do fit in a harmonic series of a<br/>relatively close root then the chord is harmoniously smooth.  In this case<br/>the root *may* be generated by the ear/brain and add to the sound of the<br/>chord.   The smaller ratio intervals [i.e. 1:2, 2:3, 3,4] are the most<br/>important for the harmonic function of the chord.   Note, I use ratios with<br/>the higher frequency to the right.   For some examples of chords mentioned<br/>in this tread:</p><p>Major chord,</p><p>4:5:6 has intervals,</p><p>2:3 [lowest first]</p><p>4:5</p><p>5:6.</p><p>First inversion,</p><p>5:6:8 has intervals,</p><p>3:4</p><p>5:6</p><p>5:8.</p><p>Second inversion,</p><p>3:4:5 has the ratios,</p><p>3:4</p><p>3:5</p><p>4:5.</p><p>Minor chord,</p><p>5:6|4:5 [for math use 10:12:15] has the ratios,</p><p>2:3</p><p>4:5</p><p>5:6,</p><p>[note, same as the major chord, but the order in the chord changes the<br/>sound of the chord].</p><p>First inversion,</p><p>4:5|3:4 has ratios,</p><p>3:4</p><p>3:5</p><p>4:5,</p><p>[Note, same as the *second* inversion of the major chord.</p><p>Second inversion,</p><p>3:4|5:6 has ratios,</p><p>3:4</p><p>5:6</p><p>5:8,</p><p>[You guessed it].</p><p>All six of these chords were thought to be 6 different chords, tell the<br/>idea of the root was discovered.</p><p>Dominate 7 chord [major-7 chord],</p><p>4:5:6|5:6 has ratios,</p><p>2:3</p><p>4:5</p><p>5:6 [two times]</p><p>5:9</p><p>25:36 [to week].</p><p>7-limit, dominate-7 chord [major-7 chord],</p><p>4:5:6:7 has ratios,</p><p>2:3</p><p>4:5</p><p>5:6 [two times]</p><p>4:7</p><p>5:7</p><p>6:7.</p><p>4:6:9 or 2:3|2:3 chord has ratios,</p><p>2:3 [two times]</p><p>4:9.</p><p>Major-9 chord</p><p>4:5:6:9</p><p>2:3 [two times]</p><p>4:5</p><p>5:6</p><p>4:9.</p><p>5:6:9 chord has ratios,</p><p>2:3</p><p>5:6</p><p>5:9</p><p>Mike&rsquo;s minor-7 chord, 10:12:(15):18</p><p>5:6|4:(5)|(2):3 has ratios ,</p><p>2:(3)</p><p>(2):3</p><p>4:5</p><p>5:6</p><p>(5):6</p><p>5:9</p><p>To determine the root of a chord look for the strongest interval of the<br/>chord.   The strongest interval is the interval that has the lowest ratio<br/>of two notes, which are not octave related, in the chord.   2:3 is the<br/>strongest and the inverse 3:4 is next strongest.  Most all chords have an<br/>interval of 2:3 or 3:4.   For 2:3 you have the series 1:2:3.   For 3:4 you<br/>have 1:2:3:4.   Theses are the strongest series in the chord.  The two<br/>notes may prepuce the lower notes of the series in the ear/brain if they<br/>are loud enough but this is not necessary.  Note, the 1, 2, and 4 are the<br/>same note at different octaves.  The root of the chord is the note that<br/>corresponds to the 2 or 4 of these ratios.   If there are two of these<br/>ratios in the chord use the one that comes first, lowest frequencies.</p><p>If the chord does not have one of the two above ratios,* *use the nest<br/>strongest ratio and place it in a series.   The 2 or 4 of this series will<br/>correspond to the note that is the root.</p><p>[I have not tested this completely.]</p><p>The harmonic function of the chord may determine the root of the chord in<br/>some cases.</p><p>Take Mike&rsquo;s chord, he hears it as a as a minor chord, with implied fifth.   The<br/>chord, 5:6:9 [10:12:(15):18] has the root 10:(15) = 2:(3), with 2<br/>corresponding to lowest not of the chord.</p><p>The same chord 5:6:9 has the ratio 6:9 = 2:3, with the 2 corresponding to<br/>the second note of the chord.   You can look at it this way 5:6:9 is the<br/>second inversion of 6:9:10, with the root on the bottom.   Thus the<br/>harmonic function may affect the root of the chord.</p><p>Another example is V and vii-dim have the same harmonic function.  [The<br/>vii-dim chord can be though of as a V-7 with a missing root, which is<br/>implied.]</p><p>free</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=105644 href="#105644">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2012 7:20:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Dec 23, 2012 at 3:44 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pipe organs too.
