(Hey, where&apos;d the cent button go?)...</p><p>First of all, the idea of supplementing the tuning list with web pages, that<br/>have sounds and pictures, sounds great to me!</p><p>&gt;Message: 6<br/>&gt;   Date: Thu, 7 Jan 1999 20:12:37 -0800<br/>&gt;   From: <a href="mailto:csz@wco.com">csz@wco.com</a> (Carter Scholz)<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Gary Morrison wrote:<br/>&gt;=========<br/>&gt;&gt; If we want a way for everyone to<br/>&gt;&gt; share non-ASCII resources, I think that hosting a web page (or even just an<br/>&gt;&gt; FTP site) for sounds, diagrams, etc, is the way to go.  For one thing, the<br/>&gt;&gt; material is then automatically archived for future reference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   That&apos;s a good point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   How would you recommend such a thing be managed?  That in the sense of how<br/>&gt;a lot of people can add pages to a single site that (as far as I know)<br/>&gt;inherently only one person can store files to.</p><p>Maybe a &quot;Guest List&quot; is a possible alternative for this.  (Warning:  I<br/>haven&apos;t thought this out - the idea may suck.)  I have seen Guest Lists that<br/>allow a minimal amount of HTML to be added as part of the guest&apos;s message.<br/>So as others view the list, they see pictures, hyperlinks, etc. added by the<br/>guests.  Here&apos;s an example (some guy added a picture of him with his<br/>motorcycle):</p><p>  <a href="http://saturn.guestworld.tripod.lycos.com/wgb/wgbview.dbm?owner=delphina13">http://saturn.guestworld.tripod.lycos.com/wgb/wgbview.dbm?owner=delphina13</a></p><p>What&apos;s good about it is it would run itself (except for occasional &quot;list<br/>management&quot;, like deleting out offensive text or something).</p><p>&gt;==========<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I know nothing, really, about the practicalities of managing a Web page,<br/>&gt;but HTML is a simple scripting, or formatting, language run atop Internet<br/>&gt;protocols, so read/write permissions are an OS (probably Unix) matter.<br/>&gt;Probably someone would need to write an HTML front page, and get permission<br/>&gt;from the host to set r/w access for the users.</p><p>I doubt you&apos;ll want to give general &quot;write permission&quot; to a page, because a<br/>mistake by any of the users could cause the whole thing to get deleted or<br/>overwritten.  For that reason, a page with &quot;append permission&quot; is safer.  By<br/>&quot;append&quot;, I mean a page that allows users to add stuff but not delete.  The<br/>aforementioned Guest Lists work this way.</p><p>Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;...</p><p>--Mark<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;   |<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+</p></div>
