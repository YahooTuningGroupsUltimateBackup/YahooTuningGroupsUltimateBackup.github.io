Any suggestions?</p><p>&#x9;Ok, I have one suggestion: to imput the optimizer with random 12-t scales,<br/>asking it to discard any results which contain unisons, and see if you get<br/>any strongly differing from the well/equal temperments.  But as I say this<br/>I&apos;m thinking, couldn&apos;t we reason that we won&apos;t get any results differing<br/>widely from 12-tET since 12-tET is the highest ET to give results w/o<br/>unisons.  Higher numbered scales tend to settle into unisons because the<br/>entropy in the adjacent notes is too high and close enough to the other<br/>side of the largest hump in the entropy curve.  So if any of the notes are<br/>much closer together than 100 cents, we should expect the same results.<br/>But this is very loose reasoning.  Maybe the random inputs would be useful<br/>for lower cardinalities, if you can do them without memory overloads.  I&apos;m<br/>interested, especially in the 12, 7, and 5 tone cases, to see if we find<br/>any results which aren&apos;t meantonish.<br/>&#x9;I have another idea.  Could you qualify the entropy calculation so that,<br/>instead of decreasing to minimum entropy at the unison, the entropy<br/>increases asymptotically approaching unison?  This would prevent pairs from<br/>settling into unisons, and the optimizer could then give good results for<br/>9, 11, 13 and higher cardinalities.</p><p>jason</p></div><h3><a id=11908 href="#11908">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2000 4:47:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Jason_Yust &lt;jason_yust@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;I think I showed that one can take a smooth ride through these<br/>&gt; &gt;well-temperaments &quot;downhill&quot; to 12-tET -- its just that the<br/>optimizer got a<br/>&gt; &gt;little lost.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m clear here: if the optimizer only returns<br/>rel. min&apos;s then<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no smooth ride which is all downhill, right?</p><p>I&apos;m almost positive I could construct such a smooth ride for any of<br/>the well-temperaments it found, which means that the points it found<br/>were not really local minima but only looked that way to the<br/>optimizer&apos;s algorithm (which, based on numerical methods, is not<br/>foolproof).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Ok, I have one suggestion: to imput the optimizer with random<br/>12-t scales,<br/>&gt; asking it to discard any results which contain unisons, and see if<br/>you get<br/>&gt; any strongly differing from the well/equal temperments.
