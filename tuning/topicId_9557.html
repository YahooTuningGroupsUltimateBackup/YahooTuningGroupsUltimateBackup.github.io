First, no microtonal tunings allowed (at least on the<br/>prototype I played). Second, it does not tune the strings by feedback, but<br/>rather requires you to tune it right the first time, then retunes by<br/>changing string tension blindly. It tunes by rote, so you cannot change<br/>string guages unless you readjust everything. As I say, I played a<br/>prototype so things may have changed. Third, it is ungodly expensive, but<br/>they said they were working on a cheaper implementation. A friend of mine<br/>worked with their engineers as a consultant, and is still in contact with<br/>them periodically, so if you want any inside info on the current state, I<br/>can put you in touch with him.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
