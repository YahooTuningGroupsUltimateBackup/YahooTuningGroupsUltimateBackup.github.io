Anyway I&apos;ve rounded it to max of 12 decimal places, so<br/>should show 0 now.</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm">http://www.tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm</a></p><p>&gt; Also the cents values in the scale examples are sometimes rounded and<br/>&gt; sometimes not, could you have them as no decimal places all the time?<br/>&gt; I think that&apos;s much cleaner there.</p><p>What&apos;s happening here is that it shows a maximum of one decimal place,<br/>rather than always showing one place. So if the decimal value is 0 it<br/>leaves it out.</p><p>I&apos;ve changed this to show a fixed number of decimal places - that<br/>also helps when comparing the two sets of cents figures<br/>as they line up nicely. Also set the default to show no decimal<br/>places so you&apos;ll see whole numbers of cents.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=38315 href="#38315">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2002 1:28:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI there,</p><p>For anyone who is following this, I&apos;ve now done the<br/>scale tree for the case of the original ou scales<br/>and the ones repeating at integer repeats.<br/>I can&apos;t yet see the pattern for the general<br/>rational case.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm">http://tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm</a></p><p>Try entering any integer for the scale repeat.</p><p>Then click to make both the scale tree and the<br/>lookup - by the lookup I mean Dan&apos;s et scale tree<br/>which you use to look up ratios in the<br/>ratio scale tree.</p><p>It&apos;s easiest to click Both, then you see what you<br/>are looking for in brackets after it:</p><p>E.g. for r = 3 and x = 3.5 you make:</p><p>0/10 (1/1) 14/14 (3/1) [1]<br/>14/24 (4/2)  [2]<br/>14/34 (5/3) 28/38 (7/3)  [3]<br/>14/44 (6/4) 28/58 (9/5) 42/62 (11/5) 42/52 (10/4)  [4]</p><p>This means that for example you&apos;ll find the 7/3<br/>as the 28th entry in the 38 note over/ under scale</p><p>To test that, put 28 as the scale degree, and 38 as<br/>the number of notes and click make uo scale,<br/>and look in the Value field and you will find that<br/>it is indeed 7/3.</p><p>I&apos;ve posted to the tuning-maths list with the<br/>experimental data.</p><p>Also haven&apos;t proved anything yet, leaving that<br/>for later.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
