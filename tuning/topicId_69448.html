If the augmented sixth itself is tuned as 7/4, then in just intonation, the chords are voiced:</p><p>Italian: 1/1 5/4 7/4 &gt; 4:5:7<br/>German: 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 &gt; 4:5:6:7<br/>French: 1/1 5/4 7/5 7/4 &gt; 20:25:28:35</p><p>There&apos;s another augmented sixth chord called an English sixth, which replaces the perfect fifth of the German sixth with an enharmonically-equivalent double augmented fourth. If the root is A-flat, that&apos;s Ab C D# F#. The fifth is lowered by a quarter-tone in 31-TET.</p><p>My question is: how should an English sixth be voiced in JI? In 11-limit, I&apos;m thinking 1/1 5/4 16/11 7/4 &gt; 44:55:64:77 in 11-limit, but are there better ideas and better prime limits?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3><a id=69449 href="#69449">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2007 6:13:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s another augmented sixth chord called an English sixth,<br/>which<br/>&gt; replaces the perfect fifth of the German sixth with an<br/>&gt; enharmonically-equivalent double augmented fourth.

If you look at the 7-limit lattice, you can see how<br/>using 48/35 in place of 11/8 gives you a good 11 close to 1 in lattice<br/>distance, which is convenient. In fact, 48/35 has a Hahn distance of<br/>only 2, which is awfully short considering how small a comma 385/384<br/>is. You get something similar from 100/99 or 99/98, but they are much<br/>larger, and 56/55 equates 11/8 to 7/5, which is a Hahn distance of 1,<br/>but this does not do justice to the 11-limit. So there is arguably<br/>something fairly special about 385/384 tempering.</p></div>
