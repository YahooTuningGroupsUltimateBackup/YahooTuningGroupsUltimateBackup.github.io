The organ in St. Burchardi Church won&apos;t be completed until<br/>2003, but air will rush out the bellows until the pipes are in place.<br/>Then the magic begins. Changes will take place monthly, and a real<br/>musician will press down the new keys, which will be then held down by<br/>weights until the next change a month later. The excitement is<br/>building.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
