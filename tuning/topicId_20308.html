(BTW, Jacky, I am awaiting<br/>your tritone ET scale -- I would love to see it.)</p><p>This symmetrical tuning I played with today on piano and<br/>it seems more conventional than the first. Seems there are<br/>more familiar harmonies. The melodic motion is more, mmm,<br/>lyrical. It is not jazzy at all like the first one.<br/>It&apos;s interesting to me how totally different it is, though<br/>of course major and minor are inversions of each other and<br/>they sound totally different too. One reason I think it&apos;s<br/>more conventional sounding is that it has quite a few more<br/>(about twice?) of those 27 step 1210 step octaves that<br/>David brought up.</p><p>(As an aside, one of my numerous recent experiments<br/>spurred by Jacky&apos;s theories lately was to stapled major on<br/>top of minor to create a two-octave symmetrical scale &amp;<br/>also cut out the middle, make them overlap. Was<br/>interesting but I think such major/minor scales will<br/>probably just be novelties for me.)</p><p>I recorded a tune using the 49:25 ET scale and<br/>then played it back with its JI sister scale<br/>(in differential notation):</p><p>10:9,36:35,49:48,36:35,10:9,21:20,<br/>21:20,10:9,36:35,49:48,36:35,10:9</p><p>... and that worked fine too, though I think I have a<br/>personal preference for the sound of the ET version,<br/>especially melody-wise.</p><p>Hm, I just retuned it to the original nonsymmetrical scale<br/>and played the same song which is kind of silly since it&apos;s<br/>not the same tuning at all. Hey, waw! I definately like<br/>the greater dissonance aand shimmer I get in the<br/>nonsymmetrical version better -- it &apos;activates&apos; more<br/>feelings it seems, if that makes any sense. It&apos;s more<br/>intense. It&apos;s got more going. (I&apos;m describing what I&apos;m<br/>hearing right now.) ... Man, I think it&apos;s those dang<br/>octave-like intervals. They just drag stuff down. It&apos;s<br/>like a giant short circuit in the tuning. Well, I guess<br/>I have stopped writing a post and started talking to<br/>myself. I apologize if this got too dull and personal.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
