Any idea how that<br/>&gt; &gt; is authentically tuned?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Alison:]<br/>&gt; Most of my repertoire for lute falls into this period, for example the<br/>&gt; vihuelistas and Francesco da Milano. The scholars agree that 12 tet was<br/>the<br/>&gt; tuning of the day, and I&apos;m quite happy to go along with this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I was playing yesterday afternoon at an Early Music event and met<br/>&gt; an instrument maker who told me he had attended an early music recital<br/>&gt; recently, a German ensemble I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The theorbo (a long necked lute with sympathetic strings) player had some<br/>&gt; system of secondary frets on the neck behind the main frets. My impression<br/>&gt; was of a version of the type of neck that Dave Beardsley and other JI<br/>&gt; guitarists might use. He also told me that the repertoire was 16th<br/>century.<br/>&gt; This would suggest either a non-12 tuning or perhaps simply microtonal<br/>&gt; inflections or even ornaments. I do know that the current crop of young<br/>&gt; early music specialists are delving into Arabic influences and that might<br/>be<br/>&gt; a factor as well. I&apos;ll try to get more details.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards<br/>&gt; a.m.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2003 11:25:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 30, 2003 9:59 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] lute tuning (was: Harmonics and...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; hi Gene and Alison,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as i wrote in the first place, lutes and<br/>&gt; other fretted strings most usually had their<br/>&gt; frets placed according to 12edo.</p><p>oops, my bad.  i see up re-reading your post that<br/>you were specifically inquiring about the late 1500s.</p><p>i believe there were many different proposals for<br/>lute tuning, and even after 1600 Mersenne gives<br/>several JI lute tunings.</p><p>here&apos;s a webpage i found which suggests that<br/>meantone was the predominant lute fretting of<br/>the late 1500s:</p><p><a href="http://www.luteshop.fsnet.co.uk/tuning.htm">http://www.luteshop.fsnet.co.uk/tuning.htm</a></p><p>... altho i wouldn&apos;t be so quick to agree that<br/>Dowland&apos;s tuning &quot;approximated 1/6-comma meantone&quot;.<br/>(for further reference, i have webpages about both tunings.)</p><p>my point was that as early as c.1590 or so<br/>12edo was being advocated as the best tuning for<br/>fretted strings, notably by Vincenzo Galilei,<br/>the father of Galileo ... he actually used a<br/>rational temperament where each fret and semitone<br/>was measured as 18:17.</p><p>(use &quot;Expand Messages&quot; to view properly on Yahoo site)</p><p>Vincenzo Galilei&apos;s lute fretting</p><p>note  fret measurement  ~cents    ~cents error from 12edo<br/>  C     (18/17)^0       0            0<br/>C#/Db   (18/17)^1      98.95459223  -1.0<br/>  D     (18/17)^2     197.9091845   -2.1<br/>D#/Eb   (18/17)^3     296.8637767   -3.1<br/>  E     (18/17)^4     395.8183689   -4.2<br/>  F     (18/17)^5     494.7729612   -5.2<br/>F#/Gb   (18/17)^6     593.7275534   -6.3<br/>  G     (18/17)^7     692.6821456   -7.3<br/>G#/Ab   (18/17)^8     791.6367378   -8.4<br/>  A     (18/17)^9     890.5913301   -9.4<br/>A#/Bb   (18/17)^10    989.5459223  -10.5<br/>  B     (18/17)^11   1088.500515   -11.5<br/>  C     (18/17)^12   1187.455107   -12.5</p><p>notice that this results in a non-8ve tuning<br/>if it&apos;s carried out beyond 12 notes.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2003 12:25:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt;my point was that as early as c.1590 or so<br/>&gt;12edo was being advocated as the best tuning for<br/>&gt;fretted strings, notably by Vincenzo Galilei,<br/>&gt;the father of Galileo ... he actually used a<br/>&gt;rational temperament where each fret and semitone<br/>&gt;was measured as 18:17.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>Vicentino said back in 1555 that &quot;the bowed viol and lute ... have been played with the divison of equal semitones.&quot;  He then suggests 31 frets to the octave as an alternative.</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2003 2:44:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; as i wrote in the first place, lutes and<br/>&gt; other fretted strings most usually had their<br/>&gt; frets placed according to 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; however, there is one *big* exception:</p><p>there&apos;s an even bigger exception: meantone fretting.</p><p>&gt; John Dowland&apos;s rational well-temperament.</p><p>hmm . . . why do you call it a well-temperament? it doesn&apos;t have<br/>12 pitches.</p></div>
