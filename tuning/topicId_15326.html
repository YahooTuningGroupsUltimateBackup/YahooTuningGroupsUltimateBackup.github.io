You can tune notes by<br/>arbitrary expressions, that&apos;s not a problem.  What may be is getting a<br/>function that can listen to all notes, and remember past ones.  The way<br/>synthesizers work, each degree of polyphony lives in its own world, and<br/>the way expressions work they don&apos;t have memory.  The first problem could<br/>be fixed provided you tune all notes to the same scale.  The second one<br/>I&apos;m looking at for other reasons, and I expect I&apos;ll fix it with a bit of<br/>poking.</p><p>&gt; If it could do this I don&apos;t think I would need any other synth or<br/>&gt; module or<br/>&gt; software synth. It seem to do it all.</p><p>Oh yes, it can do everything, but not all at the same time.  At least not<br/>with the base system.  So you either need non-real time hackery, or some<br/>other synths.  It&apos;s also based around low-level components, and there<br/>aren&apos;t many presets to start you off with.  And it doesn&apos;t have any of<br/>these new-fangled physical modelling algorithms.  So it&apos;s still useful to<br/>have something else around.</p><p>Note though, on the positive side, that it&apos;s external *effects* you won&apos;t<br/>need as well.</p><p>It works well with external sound sources, and can be used to process<br/>sample files.  I&apos;m hoping there&apos;ll be a way of dumping the samples into a<br/>retuned SoundFont to play through the soundcard, but that&apos;s still blue<br/>skies stuff.</p><p>Also, as it uses external DSPs, you can use it alongside software synths.</p><p>       Graham.</p></div><h3><a id=15347 href="#15347">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2000 7:51:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Justin White:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I have just one hesitation though.

I believe JI Relay<br/>&gt;is somewhat outdated . . . John?</p><p>Yes.  I had better real-time adaptive tuning going on the NeXT (though<br/>still very far from ideal).  JI Relay is very primitive in its tuning<br/>choices, and tends to change the tuning too often.  I tossed JI Relay<br/>off in the first two months after joining the list in March 1999, and<br/>since then have focused on retuning complete sequence files in<br/>non-real-time.</p><p>The problems of real-time adaptive tuning are daunting, for the simple<br/>reason that a new chord tends to start sounding just before an old<br/>chord ends, but the new notes don&apos;t have &quot;knowledge&quot; of which existing<br/>notes are about to switch off, so tuning decisions become bad.  Starting<br/>a note at one tuning, then moving it later, is painful, but what else is<br/>there to do?</p><p>I can imagine a very sophisticated real-time adaptive tuning program<br/>that &quot;learns&quot; what transitions to expect and makes tuning decisions on<br/>that basis.  But I&apos;m deep into leisure (full knowledge) retuning and<br/>will probably continue to be so for the foreseeable future.</p><p>To the best of my knowledge, there is no really good real-time adaptive<br/>tuning program available today.  Other readers who have tried the<br/>Justonic software haven&apos;t seemed to be too thrilled with its adaptive<br/>capabilities.  It may be better than JI Relay, however.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=15357 href="#15357">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
