So get a grip folks.</p><p>It seems foolish to come to the defense of 12tet, but,<br/>there are some things it does quite well. Excellent<br/>fifths, useable thirds, &quot;9/8==10/9&quot;...</p><p>And it has some very interesting properties by being so<br/>readily divisible (diminished chords, augmented chords,<br/>tritone substitutions, whole tone scales)...</p><p>As one who has composed and played an awful lot of 12tet<br/>music, my journey into microtonalism is a stumbling one.<br/>Besides all the technological hurdles (instruments), there<br/>is some sense of throwing the baby out with the bathwater<br/>when the familiar tricks of the 12tet trade are taken away.<br/>Until I convince myself that I have found similar identities<br/>in a new tuning system that I have in the old, most of my<br/>microtonal adventures will remain in the laboratory.</p><p>So, I still make music; new music and good music; and grow<br/>as a musician, in a language I already have a fluency in. Why<br/>not?</p><p>Meanwhile, I&apos;ve gotten completely lost in the current<br/>math oriented thread. I looked for Fokker on the internet,<br/>periodicity blocks, etc... I couldn&apos;t find anything and<br/>have no idea what the matrix notation is referring to<br/>or why.</p><p>Oh well,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=5292 href="#5292">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/1999 6:33:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My comment about Paul being a 12tet traitor shouldn&apos;t<br/>be taken so seriously.
