I<br/>plan to contribute to other discussions soon as time permits.<br/>I was struck by the tone of Paul Griffiths&apos; NY Times review<br/>of the AFMM Concert at Columbia University - exemplified by<br/>explanatory comments to the public such as: &quot;...Also, the norm<br/>for Western music has long been 12-step equal temperament,<br/>with anything else being regarded as irregular, eccentric or<br/>plain wrong...&quot;</p><p>&#x9;Such a tone of writing shows that the author is laboring<br/>under some serious misconceptions, which, however, to him<br/>probably seem &quot;just common sense - obviously true&quot;.  Some<br/>response is required.</p><p>&#x9;As Clif Ashcraft indicated in Tuning 202 1st message,<br/>singing in the just diatonic scale as well as other non<br/>12 EQT musical practices by non fringe musicians is<br/>done and enjoyed in the present.</p><p>&#x9;12 EQT provides an illusion of universality and<br/>because of its convenience of use on keyboard instruments<br/>of limited design and undoubtedly because of the<br/>commercial advantages it afforded those in the 19th<br/>century musical instrument trade, it has been accepted<br/>unquestioningly by many present day experts.  There is now<br/>much beautiful choral music in more appealing intonation than<br/>12 EQT readily available in CD recordings.  Hopefully this is<br/>helping to lead to a deeper understanding of the fact that<br/>12 EQT has SERIOUS drawbacks.</p><p>Now, in addition, recordings in piano in mean<br/>tone temperament and just intonation<br/>are becoming available, and it is possible that these<br/>will help to awaken some more musicians to the existence of<br/>something which isn&apos;t well represented by the 12 EQT<br/>approximations, which really don&apos;t sound as good to<br/>a great many people as the compositions do in<br/>mean tone temperament or just intonation.  One musician<br/>who heard side by side performances of the same score<br/>music in EQT and mean tone temperament remarked that he<br/>was very surprised to hear such a difference, that he<br/>had been taught that the EQT compromises were so slight<br/>that they were of no practical musical significance.  He<br/>then said to me that he simply couldn&apos;t understand how<br/>EQT ever could have been adopted.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m sending excerpts from the following paper<br/>published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of<br/>America in July 1943 which serve as evidence that<br/>all along many serious musical thinkers have<br/>spoken out regarding 12 EQT&apos;s defects and the<br/>detriment to music wrought by acceptance of its<br/>deceptively simple and UNIVERSAL, but actually very<br/>constrictive scheme for music composition and performance.</p><p>Excerpts from the paper: Mean-Tone Temperament:<br/>The Classical System of Instrumental Tuning<br/>by William Braid White, The School of Pianoforte Technology,<br/>Chicago, Illinois<br/>published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America<br/>July, 1943   Volume 15 Number 1</p><p>Preliminary Section</p><p>For now more than a century, musical instruments of the keyed or<br/>valved types, of which the intonation is wholly or partially beyond<br/>the performer&#xFFFD;s control, have been tuned in what is called the<br/>&#xFFFD;Equal Temperament,&#xFFFD; whereby the octave is divided into twelve<br/>equal semitones, whose frequency ratio is therefore 1:(2**1/12) =<br/>1:1.0594631...</p><p>&#x9;Equal temperament is a compromise adopted for practical reasons,<br/>and particularly because the keyboard pattern of musical<br/>instruments had already, by the end of the seventeenth century,<br/>become settled in its present form.  So long as this keyboard<br/>pattern shall be retained, equal temperament is likely to prevail<br/>for the tuning of keyboard instruments.  Since, moreover, these<br/>instruments have come, in practical fact, to dominate the art of<br/>music, they have also gradually but irresistibly imposed equal<br/>temperament upon that art as a whole, especially in the field of<br/>composition; so that the system has come to be taken for granted,<br/>and its defects completely ignored by the generality of<br/>musicians, while the great world outside professional circles<br/>remains almost entirely ignorant that any tuning problem calling<br/>for compromise or defect even exists.</p><p>Now, equal temperament gives to the musician complete freedom of<br/>modulation (transfer from tonality to tonality) throughout all<br/>the combinations possible within a twelve-semitone octave.  It<br/>treats all such combinations in the same way; and it<br/>standardizes, as well as vastly simplifies, both the construction<br/>and the playing of keyboard instruments.</p><p>These advantages, however, are gained only at the cost of serious<br/>defects.  Equal temperament allows one and only one interval, the<br/>octave, to be tuned exactly.  Every other interval is necessarily<br/>more or less distorted (made too wide or too narrow).  Some of the<br/>facts are shown below in Table I.</p><p>TABLE I. Distortions of some musical intervals by equal<br/>temperament.<br/>Name of Interval&#x9;Exact (untempered)&#x9;Kind of&#x9;Amount of<br/>&#x9;frequency ratio&#x9;Distortion&#x9;Distortion<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;in cents*</p><p>Perfect fifth&#x9; 2:3&#x9;       Narrowed&#x9;&#x9;  2<br/>Perfect fourth&#x9; 3:4&#x9;       Widened&#x9;&#x9;  2<br/>Major third&#x9;     4:5&#x9;       Widened&#x9;&#x9; 14<br/>Minor third&#x9;     5:6&#x9;       Narrowed&#x9;&#x9; 16<br/>Major sixth&#x9;     3:5&#x9;       Widened&#x9;&#x9; 16<br/>Minor sixth&#x9;     5:8&#x9;       Narrowed&#x9;&#x9; 14<br/>Harmonic minor<br/>   seventh&#x9;     4:7&#x9;       Widened&#x9;&#x9; 31<br/>Major seventh&#x9;8:15&#x9;       Widened&#x9;&#x9; 12<br/>Minor seventh&#x9; 5:9&#x9;       Narrowed&#x9;&#x9; 18</p><p>* The &#xFFFD;cent&#xFFFD; is an artificial interval representing .01 equal<br/>tempered semitone.  Its frequency ratio is, therefore,<br/>1:2**(1/1200) = 1:1.0005778 nearly.  The cent is defined in the<br/>A.S.A. Standard Acoustical Terminology - Z24..6.12, 1936.</p><p>The distortions shown above are peculiar to equal temperament, and<br/>of course they COLOR AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY INFLUENCE THE EFFECTS OF<br/>ALL MUSIC PERFORMED ACCORDING TO ITS REQUIREMENTS.  Naturally,<br/>then, it comes about that when music, written originally in days<br/>when another and very different system of intonation was<br/>prevalent, and thus essentially determined by that system as to<br/>its chordal and general harmonic pattern, is performed, as<br/>necessarily happens today, on equally tempered keyboard<br/>instruments, it does not sound and cannot in fact sound as its<br/>composers expected it to sound and as it sounded to their<br/>listeners.</p><p>This other system, the immediate predecessor of equal temperament,<br/>held the field for some three hundred years, up to the opening of<br/>the nineteenth century, before it was superseded<br/>completely.</p><p>(until the latter half of the 19th century<br/>in the United States -- Ellis translating Helmholtz<br/>gives 1846 and 1854 respectively as the dates of adoption of<br/>equal temperament in the trade for pianos and organs<br/>in England respectively - D. Hill.)</p><p> For it, our present system of musical intonation was<br/>worked out, with its foundation of key signatures and relations.<br/>It prevailed during the whole of the great formative or classical<br/>period of our western music; nor can there be any doubt that its<br/>psychological influences, as well as the conditions it imposed<br/>upon every kind of musical composition, were markedly different<br/>from that which we have come in these days so completely to accept<br/>and take for granted.</p><p>&#x9;For these reasons, if for no others, it seems worth while once<br/>more to set forth an exposition of this classical system of<br/>intonation, the famous &#xFFFD;Mean-Tone&#xFFFD; temperament, and to give<br/>likewise some simple and practical directions whereby it may be<br/>tuned upon pianofortes and organs.  The intonational and therefore<br/>the psychological differences of musical effect thus revealed are<br/>well worth the attention and study of all who are interested in<br/>musical science.  The remainder of this paper is devoted to this<br/>object.</p><p>Conclusion of Paper</p><p>...The equal temperament telescopes the discrepancies and thus<br/>evades the difficulties, although at the cost of other defects.</p><p>&#x9;Nevertheless, as everyone will testify who has made the trial,<br/>the mean-tone tuning is better fitted for the performance of<br/>music that was written when it stood as the prevailing system<br/>of tuning; and that of course comprises the music of the whole<br/>classical age, from Tallis and Byrd to Mozart and Beethoven.<br/>It is certain that equal temperament does not represent the<br/>last, even if it certainly comprises the latest, word that may<br/>be said on the subject of musical intonation.  AS THE ART OF<br/>MUSIC CONTINUES ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE QUESTIONS THAT EQUAL<br/>TEMPERAMENT LEAVES UNANSWERED WILL PERSISTENTLY PRESS FOR<br/>ATTENTION.  Meanwhile the present paper, by directing<br/>attention once more to the system that for so long held the<br/>field and that formed the foundation of the most splendid<br/>achievements in musical composition yet brought into being,<br/>may do something to uncover a fascinating and fruitful<br/>region of research and discovery.</p><p>I believe that the relevant parts of Dr. White&apos;s paper<br/>ought to be required reading in any music course which covers<br/>the topic of musical intonation and temperament.  They&apos;re well<br/>worth reading by anyone with access to a university<br/>library.</p><p>Dave Hill     La Mesa, CA</p></div><h3><a id=3355 href="#3355">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/1999 3:47:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I believe that the relevant parts of Dr. White&apos;s paper<br/>&gt; ought to be required reading in any music course which covers<br/>&gt; the topic of musical intonation and temperament.
