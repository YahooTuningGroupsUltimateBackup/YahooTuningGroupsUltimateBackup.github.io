Tunes you pick to<br/>&gt; play have to work on the instrument.</p><p>Well, as it happens, sometimes a melody pops up in my mind and I start thinking: &quot;What about playing this tune on an overtone flute?&quot; And after a few measures, I find: &quot;Aha, I would need a pitch like such and such; and that particular pitch can&apos;t be played on this flute.&quot; And then I realize: &quot;Oh, if I transpose the whole thing up by a fifth, for example, it actually *can* be played.&quot; And I just thought there might be a way to somehow &quot;think a bit faster&quot; so that I would need less time for<br/>A) knowing whether a particular melody can be played on such an instrument,<br/>B) composing new melodies even without having an overtone flute in my hands.<br/>- I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re familiar with the fact that a lot of people still haven&apos;t understood that an overtone flute is a melodic instrument and play it as if it were some sort of percussive instrument controled by breathing. That&apos;s why I&apos;m so keen on promoting the &quot;melodic side&quot; of it.</p><p>&gt; However, have you asked other professional flautists?
