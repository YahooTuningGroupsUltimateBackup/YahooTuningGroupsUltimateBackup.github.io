As Dave Keenan and I have discussed, you can get very interesting<br/>effects from such a tuning, which I&apos;ve been able to experiment with to a<br/>limited extent on my keyboard.</p><p>&gt;The most obvious compromise of our pure 9:7 hypermeantone tuning is<br/>&gt;the tempering of the fifths (and fourths) by about 6.82 cents, an<br/>&gt;amount approaching that in 1/3-comma meantone (~7.17 cents) or 19-tet<br/>&gt;(~7.22 cents), and also the tempering of major seconds and minor<br/>&gt;sevenths by a full 1/2 septimal comma in the context of such<br/>&gt;relatively concordant sonorities as 4:6:9, 6:8:9, 8:9:12, or 9:12:16.</p><p>Certainly in the case of 9:12:16, I would say that, for most musically<br/>useful timbres and registers, the 16:9 minor seventh is already too complex<br/>a ratio to be perceptibly worsened by mistuning. Instead, bringing it any<br/>distance (in this case, halfway) towards 7:4 only improves its concordance.<br/>Meanwhile, the two perfect fourths are only tempered by 1/4 of a septimal<br/>comma. As a result, this two-stacked-fourths chord (and for similar reasons,<br/>chords of three stacked fourths) sounds very pleasant in &quot;pure 9:7<br/>hypermeantone tuning&quot;, or the virtually identical 22-tET.</p></div>
