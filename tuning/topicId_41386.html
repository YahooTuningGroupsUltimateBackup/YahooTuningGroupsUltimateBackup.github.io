This kind of sounds like Ornette Coleman,<br/>and your other stuff sounded like alternately tuned Feldman.</p><p>That&apos;s a big jump!  No problem with that, just mentioning it.</p><p>Yes, I couldn&apos;t hear the electronics at all until the big climax.<br/>Maybe the nature of the piece would have been somewhat different if<br/>that part had been louder, dunno.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for the post.  Probably any more discussion of this<br/>kind should be on the Szanto MMM list.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
