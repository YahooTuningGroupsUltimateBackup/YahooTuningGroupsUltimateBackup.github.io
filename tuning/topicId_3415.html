Yes, those of us that are around the<br/>harpsichord world may bed kept up to speed on a few temperaments, but so far,<br/>it seems that one out of 20 techs are multi-temperament.  Hardly enough for a<br/>crusade, but perhaps enough for a revival.<br/>    Aural tuning of these temperaments never caught on.  That is why it is<br/>such a boon to have TuneLab, SAT&apos;s and RCT&apos;s out there. The average tech need<br/>only learn the context the earlier tunings represent, and the production of<br/>them is simple.  This harkens back to McClaren&apos;s postings on technology<br/>having its effect on intonation.      &#x9;Today, the combination of modern<br/>machines with Barbour and Jorgensen&apos;s research makes an entirely new tonal<br/>landscape feasible and I have come to believe that in this &quot;landscape&quot; that<br/>the piano becomes a more musical instrument.   i.e. the tonal resources<br/>available from an unequal tuning are more complex and extensive than from one<br/>which has regular sizes of everything.</p><p>Hmm, this is now either a thread or a fuse...<br/>regards,<br/>Ed</p></div>
