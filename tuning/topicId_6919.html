While this<br/>might include his use of the tones in the pyknon,  I would venture that the<br/>tendency toward modulation, melisma and to vary from the direction of the<br/>pitch accent were more serious violations.  To my ears, at least, the<br/>surviving fragments from _Orestes_ do indeed have some awkward-sounding<br/>moments.</p><p>The strings added by Timotheus more probably extended the range of the<br/>instrument than interpolated additional tones to the scale (which presumably<br/>had a maximum of seven pitch classes within any successive octave).</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div>
