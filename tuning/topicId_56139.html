They actually *welcome* microtonal music, which is<br/>exceptional for string players... :) and specifically *asked* for a<br/>microtonal piece.</p><p>This is the duo that performed last year on Johnny Reinhard&apos;s AFMM<br/>series.</p><p>I&apos;ve posted this piece up on my &quot;Tuning Lab&quot; site, rather than my<br/>composition site on SoundClick since it really is just a MIDI demo.</p><p>I note there has been a lot of discussion on MakeMicroMusic recently<br/>about making wonderful demos for performers. However, I really don&apos;t<br/>think it makes all that much difference to them, based upon my<br/>experiences. They really just want to go and play the piece<br/>themselves, so they&apos;re only listening to get an idea of it...</p><p>So, if you&apos;re demanding wonderful cello sounds, you won&apos;t hear them,<br/>since is still my old MIDI system with TX81Zs. I&apos;m hoping to upgrade<br/>to a software synth and soundfonts fairly soon, but, in the meantime,<br/>this is a usable demo. Oh... there are no *dynamics* in it, either,<br/>but who needs them, anyway... :) The &quot;Blackjack&quot; pitches are pretty<br/>accurate, though, with the tuning-table-based synths; I think moreso<br/>than with pitch bend approaches...</p><p>Anyway, here is the piece:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/5/tuninglabmusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/5/tuninglabmusic.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;m happy to hear any criticism, the good, bad or ugly.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>P.S.  I would urge any posters here to check out MakeMicroMusic.  Of<br/>late it&apos;s been *very* active, with lots of posting and discussion of<br/>new microtonal work:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/">/makemicromusic/</a></p></div>
