JOHNSON</p><p>The strings of a harpsichord, an old joke has it,<br/>will stay in tune for only 19 seconds. Most<br/>early-music concerts on period instruments feature<br/>a lot of tuning, sometimes to the point of making the<br/>audience squirm. Why the instruments go out of tune<br/>is no mystery. Materials like wood and gut are highly<br/>sensitive to temperature and humidity. The bigger<br/>riddle is what, exactly, it means to be in tune.</p><p>Tuning is a central but seldom discussed part of<br/>the early-music movement. There is little doubt that music<br/>of the early Baroque was played with a different<br/>system of tuning (or &quot;temperament&quot;) than is common<br/>today. The difference it makes to the music can be<br/>hard to pin down, but musicians agree that even to<br/>listeners who can&apos;t describe it, the harmonies will<br/>sound unfamiliar if not outright strange.</p><p>Baroque zealots tend to disdain modern, or &quot;equal,&quot;<br/>temperament, suggesting that every note is &quot;equally out<br/>of tune.&quot; Their ears have become accustomed to unequal<br/>temperaments. The challenge is to convince fellow<br/>musicians to learn to use and appreciate those tuning<br/>systems. Audiences, too, sometimes show resistance.</p><p>In the early 17th century the ideal was to have the third,<br/>an important note in a major chord, sound acoustically &quot;pure.&quot;<br/>This was called &quot;mean tone&quot; temperament. To modern ears,<br/>&quot;pure&quot; often translates as &quot;out of tune,&quot; when a chord is<br/>compared with its counterpart in equal temperament. On the<br/>other hand, once the ear is used to the pure thirds of mean<br/>tone, that major chord gives a wonderful sense of repose.<br/>At the same time, other mean-tone chords sound wildly<br/>dissonant, giving the music great energy. Neither<br/>effect is possible in equal temperament, which has no pure<br/>intervals at all.</p><p>Musicians who have explored historical temperaments come<br/>to feel strongly about them. As a member of the Baroque<br/>trio Romanesca, the English violinist Andrew Manze recently<br/>astounded Americans with his inspired playing of the<br/>17th-century &quot;stylus phantasticus&quot; repertory. Mr. Manze&apos;s<br/>mastery of the nuances of tuning was obvious in the group&apos;s<br/>New York debut concert at Weill Recital Hall.</p><p>Mr. Manze finds it natural to play in Baroque temperaments.<br/>&quot;On a violin, if you put your fingers on the neck without<br/>effort, it&apos;s mean tone,&quot; he said. &quot;The fingers end up being<br/>farther apart than we&apos;re usually trained for.&quot;</p><p>Surely the most famous mention of a musical &quot;temperament&quot;<br/>is in the title of Bach&apos;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier.&quot; The<br/>late 17th and the 18th centuries produced a variety of<br/>temperaments that stretched the thirds and fifths of<br/>chords to varying degrees, approaching the idea of modern<br/>equal temperament. Even in Bach&apos;s day, &quot;well tempered&quot;<br/>was different from &quot;equal.&quot;</p><p>&quot;On a well-tempered keyboard, you could play in all keys<br/>more or less acceptably,&quot; said Raymond Erickson,<br/>a musicologist and harpsichordist at Queens College and<br/>the director of the Aston Magna Academy. &quot;But certain<br/>chords would still be more racy or ripe than others.&quot;</p><p>Mean-tone becomes problematic in larger ensembles.<br/>&quot;For orchestral music, you have to be careful,&quot; said<br/>Stephen Hammer, a Baroque oboist and the artistic director<br/>of the New York Collegium. &quot;I don&apos;t think equal temperament<br/>is so bad. It needs to sound in tune above everything else.<br/>Thinking in a temperament limits how in-tune you can play.&quot;</p><p>The oboe does not have fixed pitches, like a harpsichord&apos;s<br/>strings, so it is not restricted to a particular temperament.<br/>The violin and other fretless string instruments are also<br/>free of such limitations except in the way their open strings<br/>are tuned. &quot;Temperament is very important,&quot; Mr. Manze said.<br/>&quot;For the violin there&apos;s no pattern to follow unless there&apos;s one in your<br/>own mind.&quot;</p><p>With fretted string instruments, like the guitar, lute<br/>and theorbo, and the various viols, the design of the<br/>instrument changes the rules. Because each fret goes all<br/>the way across the fingerboard, it creates equal<br/>intervals on each string. So equal temperament was advocated<br/>for tuning lute strings as early as the 16th<br/>century. Yet lutenists have learned tricks to &quot;temper&quot;<br/>their instruments in ensembles, like tying pieces of gut<br/>just above the fret, or attaching bits of toothpick to the fingerboard.</p><p>Keyboard instruments have their own special issues. On a<br/>modern piano, for example, there is one black key between the<br/>white keys D and E. That black key is called both D sharp<br/>and E flat. On a harpsichord in mean tone, D sharp and E flat a<br/>re separate pitches, a fifth of a tone apart. A key tuned a<br/>s E flat cannot be used for D sharp.</p><p>During the mid-15th century in Italy, composers and players<br/>experimented with chromatic notes. It occurred to someone<br/>to make two small keys between D and E, so that the<br/>keyboardist could play either D sharp or E flat. And so<br/>the split-key organ and harpsichord were born.</p><p>The organ came first and was specifically designed to<br/>accompany singers in church. Split keys offered the<br/>great advantage of making every major and minor chord<br/>sound pure, avoiding the unhappy compromise of<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>C HRISTOPHER STEMBRIDGE, a keyboardist and musicologist<br/>at the School of Church Music in Brescia,<br/>Italy, and an expert in Italian music of the late<br/>Renaissance and early Baroque, owns an instrument<br/>called a &quot;cimbalo cromatico,&quot; or chromatic harpsichord.<br/>It has 19 notes per octave, allowing for every distinct<br/>natural, sharp and flat note. Such instruments existed<br/>during the 17th century, in Italy and elsewhere.</p><p>The most extreme split-key instruments, called<br/>&quot;archicembalos,&quot; had 28, 31, even 36 keys per octave:<br/>obviously, more than two keys for each piano black key.<br/>&quot;It becomes very illogical to play,&quot; said Mr. Stembridge,<br/>who has tried to play a 1606 instrument with 31 notes<br/>per octave. &quot;I cannot imagine that anyone played fluently on this.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Stembridge finds that his 19-note cimbalo cromatico<br/>poses no real problems for the player accustomed to ordinary<br/>mean-tone harpsichords. For each split key, the sharp or flat<br/>usually found in mean tone is at the front. The player<br/>reaches to the back of the key to find the less-used chromatic note.</p><p>Like split-key organs, the cimbalo cromatico was<br/>originally intended to accompany singers. But some<br/>composers and theorists of the late 16th and early<br/>17th centuries wrote pieces specifically to show off its<br/>unusual capabilities. These composers, like Ascanio<br/>Mayone and Giovanni Maria Trabaci, are not exactly<br/>household names.</p><p>When Mr. Stembridge plays in the United States, he<br/>uses a cimbalo cromatico built for him by Willard<br/>Martin, a harpsichord maker in Bethlehem, Pa. Mr.<br/>Martin has a special interest in the chromatic harpsichord,<br/>which reaches beyond the obvious issues of temperament.</p><p>The 16th century produced a flowering of neo-Platonic<br/>mysticism among the European aristocracy. One<br/>manifestation was an attempt to equate musical notes<br/>with visual colors.</p><p>Mr. Martin is interested in the 16th-century painter<br/>Giuseppe Arcimboldo. In a treatise from 1590, Mr.<br/>Martin explained, &quot;Arcimboldo presented a formula<br/>with which he had converted paintings into pieces of<br/>music.&quot; In that treatise he uses the word &quot;gravicembalo&quot;<br/>to describe the instrument in the court of Prague<br/>on which he made such a conversion. But Mr. Martin<br/>believes that it was some kind of cimbalo cromatico.<br/>According to court inventories, there was one in Prague<br/>at the time.</p><p>Unfortunately, Arcimboldo did not disclose which paintings<br/>he converted. As he was writing the treatise, he<br/>would have been painting the famous portrait of Rudolf II<br/>of Prague in fruits and vegetables.</p><p>&quot;The neo-Platonic idea that tone and color can be unified<br/>was like an alchemic article of faith,&quot; Mr. Martin<br/>said. &quot;It&apos;s like trying to turn lead into gold. They<br/>believed it could be done but did not know how.&quot;</p><p>Another, later, music-loving painter, Domenichino, made<br/>reference to the relationship of music to color in<br/>surviving letters. Mr. Martin is exploring the possibilities<br/>of this musical alchemy in collaboration with<br/>Thomas D. Kaufmann of the art department at Princeton University.</p><p>There is no question that the high-culture fashions<br/>of the late 16th and early 17th centuries were influenced<br/>by classical antiquity. Many experiments with music<br/>were aimed at recreating the sort of intense emotional<br/>response Aristotle described in his writings about poetry and rhetoric.</p><p>The cimbalo cromatico fits into this experimental movement.<br/>Its microtonal capabilities certainly intensify the<br/>rhetorical impact of the music. Mr. Stembridge recently<br/>demonstrated Mr. Martin&apos;s instrument to a gathering<br/>of music scholars, composers and performers in New York.<br/>Hearing so many pure intervals was disorienting.<br/>It brought out obvious physical and psychological reactions in<br/>listeners.</p><p>During a brief setting of the Kyrie by Ascanio<br/>Mayone, audience members were so alarmed at the bizarre<br/>sound that they began to giggle nervously. &quot;You&apos;re<br/>not supposed to be laughing,&quot; Mr. Stembridge said from<br/>the harpsichord. &quot;You&apos;re supposed to be praying.&quot;</p><p>Mean-tone temperament is essential to unlock the emotional<br/>charge embedded in much early Baroque music. &quot;All the<br/>music written for the piano has missed out on the<br/>opportunity for this sort of expression,&quot;<br/>Mr. Manze said. &quot;Imagine what Liszt would have done with mean-tone.&quot;</p><p>Even without questions of temperament, Baroque tuning<br/>would be a matter of controversy. Another<br/>essential issue keeps the pegs cranking up and down:<br/>pitch frequency.</p><p>Since the 1930&apos;s, pitch has been more or less<br/>universally standardized for Western art music. Today the A<br/>above middle C sounds at 440 vibrations per second.<br/>But during the Baroque, a baffling array of pitch<br/>standards were used for different instruments. From<br/>city to city, that A might sound at all sorts of<br/>pitches, from what the modern ear hears as an F<br/>above middle C, up to the modern high C.</p><p>Opinions about pitch vary widely among musicians<br/>determined to be historically accurate. Gwendolyn<br/>Toth, a harpsichordist and the director of the New<br/>York-based ensemble Artek, does her utmost to use the<br/>historically accurate pitch for any given piece.<br/>&quot;If you know something was at a high pitch and you<br/>change it to low pitch,&quot; she explained, &quot;to me<br/>it&apos;s the same thing as saying, &apos;Well, the composer<br/>wrote these 16th notes, but let&apos;s change them to these other notes.&apos; &quot;</p><p>Mr. Martin agrees that pitch is a part of the music.<br/>He recently made a harpsichord at a remarkably low<br/>pitch, reflecting the overwhelming evidence for such<br/>a standard in Paris at the time of Louis Couperin.</p><p>&quot;If you play Couperin at A = 345, which is a major<br/>third below 440, you can play slower and articulate<br/>differently,&quot; he said. &quot;The instrument teaches the<br/>musician a lot about the music.&quot; A S a performer, Mr.<br/>Stembridge sees the issue in another light. &quot;I don&apos;t<br/>think there&apos;s anything sacrosanct about pitch,&quot; he<br/>said. &quot;I see nothing wrong in playing music at<br/>whatever pitch makes musical sense and makes an instrument sing.&quot;</p><p>At the opposite extreme from Couperin is Claudio<br/>Monteverdi, whose music is thought to have been<br/>originally played at a very high pitch. &quot;A lot of<br/>violinists are not happy about that,&quot; Mr. Stembridge said. &quot;I<br/>don&apos;t see any merit in trying to be authentic in a<br/>case where the musicians are uncomfortable.&quot;</p><p>Enter the fearless Mr. Manze, known for his use of<br/>scordatura, a technique in which the violin strings<br/>are purposefully tuned at the &quot;wrong&quot; pitch to achieve<br/>particular effects. &quot;I think a lot of violinists are<br/>awfully precious about pitch, worrying that it will<br/>harm their instruments,&quot; Mr. Manze said. &quot;But I<br/>rather enjoy the danger of it.&quot;</p><p>Yet on the subject of historical pitch frequencies,<br/>Mr. Manze is less enthralled. &quot;It has always left<br/>me rather cold,&quot; he said. &quot;The violin was designed<br/>to be played at all sorts of pitches. You just have<br/>to slot your brain into the right pitch, then you&apos;re fine.&quot;</p><p>The pursuit of historical accuracy can be impeded by<br/>economics. Ms. Toth and her husband, Dongsok Shin,<br/>also a harpsichordist, together own nine instruments.<br/>&quot;When I first started playing, I thought I&apos;d buy one<br/>French harpsichord,&quot; Mr. Shin said. &quot;But the more<br/>seriously you get into it, the more you realize that the<br/>regional differences between instruments are important.&quot;</p><p>The physical environment can also wreak havoc on the<br/>best intentions. At a recent Artek concert at the<br/>Church of the Resurrection in Manhattan, the onstage<br/>tuning took so much time that the musicians<br/>nervously joked with the audience. &quot;We couldn&apos;t tune in<br/>the sacristy, because it was too cold, so everyone<br/>had to go out and tune with me,&quot; Ms. Toth said. &quot;The<br/>practicality is almost insurmountable.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Shin has run into other practical troubles lately.<br/>&quot;I just did a concert at low French pitch,&quot; he said. &quot;But<br/>the three string players all had to go to the shop and<br/>have their sound posts adjusted for this concert. One<br/>of the violinists was playing other things. He had to<br/>borrow a violin so he wouldn&apos;t have to tune his<br/>instrument up and down.&quot;</p><p>Not suprisingly, some musicians balk at such inconveniences.<br/>Part of their resistance may be caused by a lack of<br/>familiarity with Baroque practice. Playing on period<br/>instruments in period styles is not an everyday<br/>part of modern musical training.</p><p>Mr. Erickson, the harpsichordist and musicologist,<br/>teaches Baroque performance practice to doctoral<br/>students at the City University of New York, but<br/>even in that setting, practicalities limit him.</p><p>&quot;Tuning is not one of my primary concerns in teaching,<br/>because the students here all play modern instruments,&quot;<br/>he said. &quot;They are used to playing in equal temperament.<br/>You can&apos;t just pick up every couple of weeks and decide<br/>you&apos;re going to play in mean tone. So I concentrate on<br/>those things, like bowing and fingering, that I think<br/>they can put immediately into their playing.&quot;</p><p>All this fuss over pitch and temperaments may strike<br/>some as a tempest in a very arcane sort of teacup. Yet<br/>Baroque musicians and serious listeners find these issues<br/>of central importance. As Mr. Stembridge said, when asked<br/>why he commits such energy to his study of split-key<br/>instruments: &quot;No one would ever ask why the Metropolitan<br/>Museum of Art was restoring a great painting to its<br/>original colors. What I&apos;m doing is the same thing.&quot;</p><p>* * * * * * * *</p><p>What isn&apos;t in the net version of this article:</p><p>&quot;ANNE E.
