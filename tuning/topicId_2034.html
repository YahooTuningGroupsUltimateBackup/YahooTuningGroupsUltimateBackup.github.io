This is a product or LCM rule.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, Paul, are you happy with this or do we have to start that row again?</p><p>Erlich once gave the example of 15:8 vs. 6:5 against the geometric mean.<br/>The 6/5 is supposed to be more consonant, but the (n*d) for each is the<br/>same, as the 5 has simply switched sides of the fraction.</p><p>&gt;As large intervals do appear to be less consonant, the denominator rule</p><p>Aha!  The issue of large intervals comes again.  I will follow Keenan and<br/>call this &quot;span&quot;.</p><p>It is true that with a large enough span, you can play almost anything and<br/>it won&apos;t be dissonant.  So in a way, span decreases dissonance.  But, these<br/>large dyads are also more difficult to difficult to tune accurately, which<br/>suggests an increase.</p><p>Maybe the answer is that consonance and dissonance aren&apos;t mutually<br/>exclusive opposites -- In the case of large dyads, maybe we should say that<br/>the dissonance decreases, and so does the consonance!</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.
