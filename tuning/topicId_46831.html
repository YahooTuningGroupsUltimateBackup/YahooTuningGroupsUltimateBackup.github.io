And then there are other &apos;serious&apos; musicians, in whose life music gets top priority. Additionally, we have the third category of millions of avid listeners whose interest in Indian music is genuine and sustained. So, this entire, huge music-related population is divided into three classes as shown above. To this add several thousand of music students, and musicians employed woth All India radio and several other institutions.</p><p>As you know, I have often expressed my frustration about the derth of graded material on tuning math. Tuning math will help us develop objective, scientific approach to Indian music, from a fresh point of view. Though we are strong in the aesthetics of music (by cultural heritage and training), we have yet to seriously develop taste and the tools for serious study of Indian music theory. This is in spite of the fact that much research work in music is going on in universities and various institutions in India.</p><p>We seriously need good &apos;notes&apos; on Tuning Terms and Math for Indian musicians and music students. The following is a sample of how we in India would treat a topic, for beginners:<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>The diatonic scale  [Diatonic in Greek means &quot;thru tones&quot;]<br/>==================</p><p>This is the set of white keys on a keyboard, where the first white key is situated immediately to the left of the first black key. That first black key is the first of the set of five black keys, arranged like 2 + 3). Of course, there are several such sets of black keys on the keyboard; one set per octave.</p><p>The scale is defined in terms of tones(t) and semitones(s), one tone being equal to two semitones. t = 2s.</p><p>C D E F G A B c<br/> t t s t t t s</p><p>This is also represented by</p><p>C D E F G A B c<br/> L L s L L L s</p><p>where L = Large, and s = small.</p><p>In other words, the diatonic scale comprises 5 tones and 2 semitones. It is also called C major scale, called Bilawal thaat. The key &apos;C&apos; is also know in Indian music parlance as &apos;white one&apos; or &apos;sufed ek&apos;.</p><p>The scale repeats every 7 steps between 8 notes. That 8-note interval is called an octave.</p><p>Sources: [Here I will list the sources from which I have drawn my material.]</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>[My question: Is the 12-tone version also called &apos;diatonic&apos; ? If yes, then I would include that also above.]<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This is because we cannot assume any prior exposure to any topic on Tuning terms and Tuning Math.</p><p>Of course, I am writing for myself. But I know that many others would benefit from this begin-at-the-beginnig approach. I do not believe, for even a moment, that I can do this single-handed, or that it is easy, or that I will be able to complete this colossal project. That is why, primarily, I am doing this only for myself.</p><p>I sincerely urge you to send me your comments: they will help me immensely -- I cannot expect to get help from you if you do not think this is a practical idea. You know the objective; you know the target audience.</p><p>Thanking you for your time and response, and regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=46847 href="#46847">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2003 7:01:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_46831.html#46831">/tuning/topicId_46831.html#46831</a></p><p>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; [My question: Is the 12-tone version also called &apos;diatonic&apos; ?
