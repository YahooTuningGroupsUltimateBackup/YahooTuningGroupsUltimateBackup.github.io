Numbers will follow me through many a day.  The<br/>numbers,<br/>the numbers &ndash; the bells, the bells.</p><p>In the Green Room afterwards there was much talk about the similarities<br/>between studying mathematics and studying music, the bringing<br/>together of<br/>several theories, the complications resulting in the final<br/>resolutions.  It<br/>is always fascinating to hear people speaking of one discipline in terms<br/>which are thought to be the monopoly of another discipline.<br/>Inspiration,<br/>imagination, all the glowing matters of life have for long been<br/>monopolised<br/>by artists.  To discover mathematicians speaking with as much, if not<br/>more,<br/>enthusiasm and in precisely the same terms, is a revelation.</p><p>What I would have liked would have been more certainty about the<br/>connections<br/>inside the brain between mathematics and music.  But the more I think<br/>about<br/>it, the more I believe that mathematics can be connected with an<br/>enormous<br/>number of activities.  With architecture, with football &mldr; the reason<br/>might be<br/>to do with the dominance of the heartbeat inside our system and the<br/>measuring<br/>that we do every step we take, every time we count, every blink we make.</p><p>Lots of nuggets didn&rsquo;t manage to get in.  I don&rsquo;t know whether we said<br/>clearly enough that Pythagoras was led to the conclusion that the<br/>basis of<br/>everything that we find beautiful is mathematical.  The search for<br/>the equal<br/>temperament was not spelled out as much as I would have liked.</p><p>Several people tried to smooth over these difficulties, such as the<br/>early<br/>seventeenth-century Minimite friar Marin Mersenne, a mathematician<br/>who wrote<br/>extensively about music, and the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, who<br/>returned to the Greek idea of musical intervals between the various<br/>planets &ndash;<br/>the harmony of the spheres &ndash; each planet had its own scale.</p><p>And even Isaac Newton got in on the act.  Newton spent much time on<br/>musical<br/>scales, and even tried to link the seven notes of the musical scale<br/>with the<br/>colours of the spectrum.  That&rsquo;s why we often say that there are seven<br/>colours in the rainbow &ndash; it arises from Newton&rsquo;s combined researches<br/>into<br/>optics and music.</p><p>Temperament relates to the division of the octave &ndash; if you play one<br/>physical<br/>pure fifth, then another, then another then after 4 octaves you will<br/>come out<br/>a semi tone higher &ndash; even though the maths works, because you haven&rsquo;t<br/>got<br/>equal temperament.  Equal temperament is what&rsquo;s used to divide the<br/>Octave,<br/>instead of pure mathematical divisions.  There is a discrepancy in sound<br/>between a physical pure 5th and an equal temperament 5th &ndash; and similarly<br/>between a physical pure octave and an equal temperament octave.</p><p>And the search goes on now very self-consciously for more mathematics in<br/>music.  Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Master of the Queen&rsquo;s Music, has<br/>used magic<br/>squares in several of his compositions.  In one piece, he started<br/>with this<br/>8-note piece of plainchant, and this 8 &times; 8 magic square in which each<br/>row and<br/>column adds up to the same sum, 260.  Combining these in a particular<br/>way, he<br/>obtained his so-called Magic square of Mercury, and then by tracing<br/>through<br/>the numbers in it in various ways he was able to generate the pitch<br/>material<br/>for the composition.</p><p>I&rsquo;m off to whistle a happy tune as I do the five-bridge walk, while<br/>the sun<br/>shines, before a late lunch.</p><p>Best wishes</p><p>Melvyn Bragg</p><p>Visit the In Our Time website:</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/</a></p><p>or download the latest edition as an mp3 file:</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml</a></p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a> ------------  Promoting global<br/>harmony through LucyTuning  ------- for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies, contest and Flash cartoon go to<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy CD from:<br/><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a><br/>Lullabies at iTunes (if you already have iTunes installed):<br/><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist">http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist</a>?<br/>a=5165209&amp;s=143441<br/>To install iTunes go to:<br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/</a></p></div>
