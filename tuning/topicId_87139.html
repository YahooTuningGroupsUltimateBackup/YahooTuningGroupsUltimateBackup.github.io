To be honest I still have a lot of questions about how to make a &quot;theory&quot; for the 12-tone version of the tuning...the original 7-tone scale subset is much easier as it&apos;s virtually impossible to make a sour chord.</p><p>   If any of you have any ideas (any of you) I&apos;d be interested to hear them.  The real problem I see in expanding the 7-tone scale to 12....is this makes the minimum ratio between notes duck under the standard 12TET half-step AKA 15/14 so there are critical band consonance issues due to this closeness.<br/>---Then again if you want dissonance there&apos;s your gateway...go for those few close-ratio notes!---</p><p>   I&apos;m also pretty sure there are several 7-tone scales within the 12-tone tuning, the problem is you can&apos;t just slide the intervals of the root 7-tone scale ALA 12TET to get to them (typical non-TET tuning issue).</p><p>&gt;&quot;The other piece - would that be the first WIP version of this piece?&quot;<br/>     I believe so actually...the tensity this time around got bumped way up.  I can still recognize certain melodies/parts, though.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
