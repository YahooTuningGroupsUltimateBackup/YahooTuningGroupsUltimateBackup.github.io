I converted the MP3 to WAV.  The<br/>&gt;&gt; error range is +/- 1.3 hertz.  I have included the frequency range as the<br/>&gt;&gt; software does not identify precise frequencies.  The first column indicates<br/>&gt;&gt; the frequency obtained at the center of each band.  I attenuated the<br/>&gt;&gt; amplitude of the sample to narrow the frequency band.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Frequency    Range            Atttenuation<br/>&gt;&gt; 262 htz           259-267             9 dec                   cant<br/>&gt;&gt; 337                332-340              18 dec                 by<br/>&gt;&gt; 405                402-407             18 dec                   me<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Looks like that third very close to 9/7!  If anyone doubts the analysis, I<br/>&gt;&gt; will send screen shots justifying the frequencies I chose.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf responded:</p><p>&gt; Darren: my compliments for what seems to be a very precize analysis. I did<br/>&gt; some strumming and singing, like Joe, with the record in my mind, but I<br/>&gt; still didn&apos;t hear the E as being higher than usual. It felt more as if the C<br/>&gt; was much lower.</p><p>Wim, I&apos;m interested in your analysis, but I have a few questions. Since the<br/>issue has to do with the intervalic relationship of C and E, how is C being<br/>lower different from E being higher? C is lower is relation to what, if not<br/>to E? Apparently, you agree that the interval is wider than &quot;normal.&quot; Right?</p><p>&gt; In fact the very first chord which comes in after the words<br/>&gt; &quot;Can&apos;t buy me&quot; in is E minor and not C major.</p><p>I don&apos;t see how the chord that follows the phrase could influence the tuning<br/>of the phrase in question. The end of the verse is solidly in C major, the<br/>more likely influence on the tuning of the phrase.</p><p>&gt; The first C (&quot;Can&apos;t&quot;)<br/>&gt; McCartney sings is may be attracted downwards to the B in the E minor chord<br/>&gt; that follows. If we tune this C upwards from 262 to 270 Hz the C - E - G<br/>&gt; triad would be a virtually perfect 4:5:6.</p><p>But what would it be if we don&apos;t move the C? I think that is the issue.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8165 href="#8165">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2000 10:02:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear John Link,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We were discussing a sustained, stable, _locked_ major triad, not one formed<br/>&gt; by an arpeggio in the melody. While good singers can easily be 1/3 of a<br/>&gt; semitone sharp in an ascending arpeggio, I don&apos;t think that has any bearing<br/>&gt; on this discussion. The Beatles were great singers, through -- how about<br/>&gt; analyzing the pitches in &quot;Because&quot;?</p><p>Of course you are right in that my concern is for explaining simultaneously<br/>sounded harmonic relationships. Nevertheless, John is not outside the<br/>discussion in noting this melodic &quot;high third.&quot; Singers who experience the<br/>&quot;high third&quot; harmonically over a long period of time tend to sing that<br/>relationship melodically. I know you believe that singers prefer 12-tET<br/>where melody is concerned, but consider that perhaps ALL singers don&apos;t.</p><p>I believe that John was simply tossing into the discussion an example of<br/>such a singer. He could also toss (if he know them) many, if not most, of my<br/>LA Jazz choir soloists.</p><p>What is &quot;Because&quot;? I trust you are not referring to the song often sung at<br/>weddings in the fifties and sixties. I guess that&apos;s a Beatles song I don&apos;t<br/>know. I guess I can&apos;t know everything. And, of course, its a good practice<br/>to remind ourselves that none of us knows everything. It&apos;s amazing how<br/>intelligent we appear when we take that approach. :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8172 href="#8172">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
