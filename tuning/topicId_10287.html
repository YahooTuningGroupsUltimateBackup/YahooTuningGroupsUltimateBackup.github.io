Has anyone seen<br/>Rasch&apos;s<br/>&gt; study?</p><p>I reproduced this same quote on the list some time ago and also asked<br/>if anyone had seen the study. I think Rasch&apos;s finding and main point<br/>is that the &quot;correct&quot; intonation of melodic intervals is learned<br/>through experience, and whatever intervals have occured repeatedly in<br/>the listener&apos;s experience are the ones expected to be heard (to a<br/>tolerance of, say 10 cents); while harmonic intervals are heard in<br/>terms of the nearest simple ratios, and given our use of equal<br/>temperament, deviations of 20 cents (and occasionally, up to 50<br/>cents)<br/>are routinely expected.</p><p>I believe that each era of diatonic music in the West has had a rough<br/>idea of what the &quot;correct&quot; intonation of melodic intervals should be;<br/>hence the &quot;just&quot; diatonic scale has tended to sound melodically<br/>&quot;wrong&quot; due to the different sizes of major second.</p><p>I&apos;m sure Joseph Pehrson could have heard the 50-cent &quot;melodic&quot; shifts<br/>very easily in Daniel Wolf&apos;s utonal-&gt;otonal example if they hadn&apos;t<br/>been buried in the inner voices. As a primarily _harmonic_ fragment<br/>of<br/>music, Joseph essentially heard a constant upper voice, a constant<br/>bass voice, and a chord which resolved from a very poor approximation<br/>of 4:5:6:7:9 to a very good approximation of 4:5:6:7:9. (The former,<br/>of course, happened to be 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 -- in the sawtooth<br/>example, you can hear the common overtone two octaves above the<br/>highest voice very clearly if you listen for it.) I wonder, if the<br/>top<br/>voice had one of the 50-cent shifts, would Joseph have heard the<br/>chords as containing different pitches, rather than the same ones? I<br/>think so, and I think that is Rasch&apos;s point.</p></div>
