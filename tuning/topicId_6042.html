G# is usually considered<br/>&gt;to be 25/16 relative to C in JI anyway.</p><p>I&apos;m looking for an algorithmic approach that is easy to implement and play<br/>on my keyboard with foot pedals.  This is the reason I&apos;ve phrased things the<br/>way I have.  For example, the above scenario would be played by me<br/>specifying with the foot pedals where the &quot;root&quot; or &quot;tonic&quot; is going to be<br/>by pressing the E pedal key a bit before changing to the Emaj chord on the<br/>keyboard.  Then the Emaj would be played with 1 5/4 3/2 ratios, so<br/>distinguishing between G# and Ab is done by the &quot;root&quot; selection.  I would<br/>just be thinking of it as a &quot;JI major triad on E&quot;.  This seems much simpler<br/>to me to play than coming up with a way to specify whether the black key I&apos;m<br/>hitting should be a sharp or flat in the present circumstance.</p><p>I was also intending to keep the pedal pressed keys in a FIFO stack - so my<br/>sequencer would know I just came from C, so if I played foot pedal C it<br/>would take me back to the C pitch of the C I came from rather than to the<br/>new C pitch based on the scale starting at E.  I haven&apos;t worked out the<br/>mechanics for specifiying whether I want to step back further in the stack<br/>if I foot pedal a key which occured further back in the progression, but<br/>probably a foot pedal switch which says &quot;look back&quot;.</p><p>Thus I&apos;m not as interested in finely divided fixed scales as I am in a<br/>simple scale with algorithm approach that in practice would play more finely<br/>divided fixed scales if looked at from that point of view.  Or in other<br/>words a set of 12 tone scales combined with algorithms rather than a fixed<br/>scale.  I say set of 12 tone scales because it is easy to switch the mapping<br/>in the sequencer on the fly.  (I hope this isn&apos;t too muddled an explanation.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;I find that Ab F C Eb  (descend from Ab, rise to Eb) depends quite a bit on<br/>&gt;&gt;the minor third intervals.  Played high on the keyboard, it sounds awful to<br/>&gt;&gt;me in 12Tet, and takes on a different feel depending on the minor third<br/>&gt;&gt;intervals played.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So you like the melody better when the minor third intervals are tuned as<br/>&gt;_________?</p><p>6/5 sounds way better to me than 300 cents, maybe even sharper than 6/5,<br/>especially for the Eb.</p><p>John Link wrote:<br/>&gt;A very important example is the movement from IImin7 to V7 to Imaj7. For<br/>&gt;concreteness, let&apos;s consider the key of C, so we&apos;re talking about D-7 going<br/>&gt;to G7 going to Cmaj7. Here&apos;s a lattice diagram of the tones related by 5/4<br/>&gt;(up and to the left) or 3/2 (up and to the right):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/> &gt;                      B         D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                E          G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            A        C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        D       F<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I won&apos;t waste my time trying to draw the usual lines. Since we&apos;re in C we<br/>&gt;have C=1/1. Here is my conjecture of what good a cappella singers do:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        C  1/1          B  15/16        B  15/16<br/>&gt;        A  5/8          G  3/2          G  3/2<br/>&gt;        F  4/3          F  21/16        E  5/4<br/>&gt;        D  10/9         D  9/8          C  1/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Going from D-7 to G7 note that BOTH common notes adjust. Also note that<br/>&gt;while the two different D&apos;s are both in the lattice diagram, the second F<br/>&gt;is not, because relative to G it is 7/4, and I drew the lattice only for<br/>&gt;5/4 and 3/2.</p><p>I presume you use a 7/4 ratio for the G7 minor7th because it&apos;s the 7th<br/>harmonic of G, no?  And it&apos;s this choice that requires the adjustment of<br/>pitch of F.</p><p>Anyways, here&apos;s some possibilities to translate into the foot pedal sheme above.</p><p>Ignoring how I get the pitch of D to start from, I would play FP D, Dmin7,<br/>FP C, G7, Cmaj7.  I believe this would then give me exactly the chord<br/>intervals you have written above, except the 7th interval in the G7 would be<br/>16/9 instead of 7/4.</p><p>ie:  Dmin7     1, 6/5, 3/2, 9/5<br/>      G7          1, 5/4, 3/2, 16/9 (instead of 7/4)<br/>      Cmaj7     1, 5/4, 3/2, 15/8</p><p>If I had started in C by playing FP C before the FP D, then all the pitches<br/>of the Dmin7 would be shifted up by a syntonic comma compared to your<br/>example above, including the C, so if it was held from a previous tonic<br/>chord or something, it would shift up at the beginning of the Dmin7.  (Too<br/>weird for words?)  All the other pitches would be the same, except the F in<br/>the G7 would be 4/3, so it would shift down from the F in the Dmin7.</p><p>If I also included scale switching, I could switch to a scale which used<br/>10/9 for the major 2nd interval before playing FP D, then switch back to a<br/>scale which uses 9/8 for this interval before playing FP C.  This would give<br/>me exactly the pitches you describe (except for the aforementioned  G7 minor<br/>7, although harder to play.</p><p>If, in addtion to the above scale switching,  I also included a scale with<br/>the minor 7th as 7/4 instead of 9/5, and switched to this scale and played<br/>FP G before the G7, then switched back to the major 2nd = 9/8 scale and<br/>played FP C before the Cmaj7, it would be exactly what you&apos;ve given I think.<br/>But now it&apos;s getting much more complicated to play,  having to set a scale<br/>and a root or tonic before each chord.</p><p>Comments?</p><p>Jim Savage</p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>11/9/1999 1:38:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Jim Savage &lt;<a href="mailto:waldpond@oanet.com">waldpond@oanet.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I presume you use a 7/4 ratio for the G7 minor7th because it&apos;s the 7th<br/>&gt;harmonic of G, no?</p><p>Yes.
