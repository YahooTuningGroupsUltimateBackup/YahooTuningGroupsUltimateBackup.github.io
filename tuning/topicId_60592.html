I also think of food,<br/>but that&apos;s another story. The City of New Orleans is America&apos;s first<br/>music city. New Orleans is the city that truly began America&apos;s<br/>contribution to the history of music world-wide. Without it, there&apos;d<br/>be no popular music as we know it today.</p><p>When I wonder what they might need in New Orleans to get back on<br/>their feet, the stuff that gets ruined under water, I think of all<br/>the sound boards, the cables, the lighting, the microphones, the<br/>instruments; I think of the stuff you need in the hundreds of little<br/>clubs and bars that bring the music to the street - the street that<br/>brings the people to the city. And I think of the many thousands of<br/>people who depend on those people for their livelihoods.</p><p>I am determined to help restore all of those little places and bring<br/>the music back as soon as possible. I am contacting Amtrak to help us<br/>take the train &quot;The City of New Orleans&quot; from Chicago all the way<br/>down to New Orleans. We&apos;ll take two weeks beginning in early December<br/>and stop along the way at depots or high schools or performance<br/>centers of all shapes and sizes. And we&apos;ll contact the manufacturers<br/>of the very stuff we&apos;re talking about and arrange to bring a<br/>Christmas present to all the small venues within the city - we&apos;ll<br/>purchase the gear as close to cost as we can, many will undoubtedly<br/>make substantial contributions.</p><p>Will you help me bring the music back? Working together with our<br/>friends in manufacturing, retail, transportation, the venues, the<br/>promoters, the press, the agents and managers and the artists - we<br/>can help deliver the stuff that helps make New Orleans sing it&apos;s own<br/>uniquely American song. I&apos;m going anyway - with or without waiting to<br/>see who&apos;s onboard. Join us on the train, at the depot, from your<br/>office or home, but join us.</p><p>For info call my office: Rising Son Records, 10741 US Highway 1,<br/>Sebastian, FL 32958.
