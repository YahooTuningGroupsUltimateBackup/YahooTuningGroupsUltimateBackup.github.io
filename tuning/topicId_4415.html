His<br/>&gt;record notes comment on the characteristics of each scale, including<br/>&gt;similaries and differences from the 12-tone system.  This is partly<br/>&gt;in terms of whether the triads sound harmonious to us and therefore<br/>&gt;would be suitable for cadences, etc.   The effects are striking and<br/>&gt;often pleasing to my ears --- though many of the intervals sound<br/>&gt;really strange.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      In order to appreciate his comments on the respective scales, I<br/>&gt;have worked out a chart of the intervals for convenient comparison<br/>&gt;with both our equal-tempered scale and the &apos;just tuned&apos; one.  This<br/>&gt;involved using the respective power-roots of 2 to generate the<br/>&gt;multiplier for the successive scale intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      In this connection, I was wondering if any of you knew of<br/>&gt;software that would allow one to generate tones of any<br/>&gt;specific audible frequencies --- singly or in combination.  One<br/>&gt;interest is to demonstrate to students in a Sociology of Music  the<br/>&gt;differences in temperaments --- including the equal-tempered,<br/>&gt;well-tempered and mean-tone ones.  Due to the complexity of the<br/>&gt;topic, it would be valuable to add the experiential dimension to all<br/>&gt;this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Thanks,  Peter<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Peter Weeks<br/>&gt;  St.Thomas University<br/>&gt;  Fredericton, N.B., Canada<br/>&gt;  Email <a href="mailto:PWEEKS@StThomasU.ca">PWEEKS@StThomasU.ca</a></p></div><h3>Leonardo Perretti &#x3C;leo.perretti@xxxxxxxxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/1999 8:39:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Peter Weeks wrote:</p><p>.......<br/>&gt;      In this connection, I was wondering if any of you knew of<br/>&gt;software that would allow one to generate tones of any<br/>&gt;specific audible frequencies --- singly or in combination.

It is called &quot;Organum&quot;, and is<br/>specially intended for pipe organ builders/tuners; anyway, its treatment<br/>of intervals and temperaments make it very useful for tutorial purposes.</p><p>I just finished developing its essential functions, and I will put it on<br/>the web as shareware within a couple of weeks. It runs on Macintosh<br/>computers only, and uses the internal sound card of the computer, at<br/>44.1 kS/s, 16 bits; no other hardware is required. Currently, only the<br/>Italian version is available; I&apos;m just working to the English version<br/>and to the manual these days. If you want to try it I can send a copy;<br/>its interface is very friendly and intuitive.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Leonardo Perretti<br/><a href="mailto:leo.perretti@projectpp.it">leo.perretti@projectpp.it</a></p></div>
