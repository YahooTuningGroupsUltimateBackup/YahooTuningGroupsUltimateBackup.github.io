This transformation is nothing but a<br/>narrowing.</p><p>Kraig,</p><p>I agree with your point here, and as simple minded as it may sound<br/>coming from me, and from my totally music-centric point of view, all<br/>I can say is that it can be made simpler for musicians, by just doing<br/>something as easy as posting in a list of cents for a scale, or the<br/>scale degrees from 72, to help folks like me get going with the<br/>music. I think there are many among us who feel the same way, and<br/>would get allot more out of all the pure theoretical work if these<br/>simple and inclusive things were considered more often. Exclusion of<br/>these simple things are what keeps folks in the background.</p><p>Now when I see someone of noble heart, like Dave Keenan say:</p><p>&quot;But so far it&apos;s only theory. We could use some more<br/>collaboration from composers or performers.</p><p>We need some music that could only be played in this tuning, either<br/>the 31-tone or preferably the 21-tone. Even if it is only a medly of<br/>existing pieces showing off its neutral scales, hexanies, dekanies,<br/>quasi-JI majors and minors etc, subsets which have probably never<br/>before appeared together in so few notes to such great accuracy.&quot;</p><p>I know we are on the right track. (I should note that Dave has guided<br/>me toward the use of these subsets already too!) As a result of this,<br/>and Paul being kind enough to post the cents values for the 21 Tone<br/>Miracle scale, I have been able to tune up my synth, and try it out.<br/>And indeed what a lovely scale it is. The important thing here, is<br/>that I learn 1000 times more about theoretical work when I can<br/>immediately hear the scales in a musical setting. Don&apos;t care much<br/>about lattice and ratio space - can&apos;t hear it. But I would like to<br/>humbly request that there be more of this in an effort to increase<br/>participation from the lurking masses - all 450 of them. We must<br/>think of these things, when we come from the theory perspective, in<br/>order to get musicians involved, otherwise we may be confounded by<br/>what we can&apos;t hear. It is an invitation to mutual sharing between<br/>what may sometimes seem to be perspectives of polar opposites. Our<br/>needs are mutual - the need to *hear* beauty.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=22414 href="#22414">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/10/2001 11:24:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22370.html#22411">/tuning/topicId_22370.html#22411</a></p><p>&gt; Kraig,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree with your point here, and as simple minded as it may sound<br/>&gt; coming from me, and from my totally music-centric point of view,<br/>all I can say is that it can be made simpler for musicians, by just<br/>doing something as easy as posting in a list of cents for a scale, or<br/>the scale degrees from 72, to help folks like me get going with the<br/>&gt; music.</p><p>But, I ask for cents for me pocket, and me bros post it right away!?</p><p>___________ ______ _____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=22432 href="#22432">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2001 7:19:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, some of us tend to get a bit carried away with mathematical language.<br/>But when the dust settles you&apos;ll find we&apos;re only too happy to try to make<br/>it accessible to non mathematical musicians.

The vertical steps are 1 note in 72-equal, which<br/>isn&apos;t an important interval in Erlich-Keenan tuning.  They should be 2<br/>steps.  That means you can throw out every other row.

We don&apos;t need to hurry into squeezing all<br/>72 onto a keyboard.</p><p>6 rows should do fine.  It&apos;d be nice of it were slanted so octaves were<br/>all on the same row, but that&apos;s economics.  Two octaves would also be fine<br/>if that&apos;s all the budget stretches to, so long as a load of keys aren&apos;t<br/>being wasted.  Two many octaves and you&apos;ll find the scale slides off the<br/>top.</p><p>The problem with this layout is the span you need to cover an octave.<br/>Really the keys should be thin, but on a ZBoard they are wide.  The<br/>alternatives I was thinking of squash the octave into 5 steps instead of<br/>10.

Having two manuals instead of one very long<br/>keyboard might be better for multiple octaves.  Same idea as the Z-Board,<br/>in fact.</p><p>I think a grid arrangement is right in context, and also for decatonic<br/>scales, and generally where you have neutral thirds or seconds.  So we&apos;d<br/>have two basic designs: squares for these scales, and hexagons for the<br/>traditional duodecimals.</p><p>I hope we can get publication in a prominent journal to push up demand for<br/>this kind of thing.  It seems a lot of what this list considers important,<br/>particularly Erv Wilson&apos;s ideas, have passed academe by.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The alternatives I was thinking of squash the octave into 5<br/>&gt; &gt; steps instead of 10.  The lattice happens to be one of these,<br/>&gt; &gt; you might be able to adapt it to work with 6 rows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m really interested in this but don&apos;t see it.<br/>&gt; Can you give a small example?</p><p>If you take a segment of the lattice, without connecting anything up:</p><p>5^^ 8^^ 1^  4^  7^  0<br/>0^  3^  6^  9^  2   5<br/>5^  8^  1   4   7   0v<br/>0   3   6   9   2v  5v<br/>5   8   1v  4v  7v  0w<br/>0v  3v  6v  9v  2w  5w</p><p>That&apos;s giving us an octave with only 5 notes along, but a considerable<br/>vertical drift.  It also means every two steps up is a quomma, same as the<br/>12 column arrangement for 72.  If the keyboard extended in both<br/>directions, this might be useful.  In fact, it might be possible to fit it<br/>on the hexagonal arrangement.  So we have two layouts, one for melody and<br/>the other for harmony.  Unfortunately they seem to want different<br/>keyboards.</p><p>The other way of getting 5 steps to the octave is to progress by<br/>supermajor instead of minor seconds:</p><p>1^  3^  5^  7^  9^  1<br/>0^  2^  4^  6^  8^  0<br/>1   3   5   7   9   1v<br/>0   2   4   6   8   0v<br/>1v  3v  5v  7v  9v  1w</p><p>So quommas are two steps up again, and the drift&apos;s a bit smaller.  But the<br/>generality&apos;s lost because one step up could be two completely different<br/>intervals.  So I don&apos;t think this would work, but perhaps somebody can see<br/>a variation I can&apos;t.</p><p>I think the boring layout is best.  I can reach an octave on my normal<br/>keyboard.  If you had 10 keys fitting into that space they should be<br/>playable.  For melody, it&apos;s fine.  For harmony it should still work as<br/>well as what we&apos;re used to.  You wouldn&apos;t need more than 3 rows at a time<br/>for 11-limit chords.  The lattice arrangement may be best if you want to<br/>play decimally on a MicroZone.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For a Ztar, emulating the Blackjack fretting pattern should<br/>&gt; &gt; work too.  I still don&apos;t know how to tune the strings, but<br/>&gt; &gt; 6 strings and 6 generators to a fifth may be significant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, an example would help me understand.<br/>&gt; I like visuals.</p><p>Consider the neck held with the nut on the left.  The frets would be:</p><p>#  ||  ||  ||  |||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||<br/>#  ||  ||  ||  |||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||<br/>#  ||  ||  ||  |||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||<br/>#  ||  ||  ||  |||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||<br/>#  ||  ||  ||  |||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||<br/>#  ||  ||  ||  |||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||</p><p>and that should give you one octave.  This obviously isn&apos;t to scale.  It<br/>partly mimics the fretting I already use.  Hopefully you could work it out<br/>so that the wider spacing works for the most important notes.  All we need<br/>is a way of tuning the strings to get nice easy chord patterns, and<br/>roughly the same gamut on each string.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As the notation uses 10 nominals, coloring those white and<br/>&gt; &gt; everything else black should work fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once again, an example please.  Try to post something that<br/>&gt; I can render in a diagram like the ones I&apos;ve already made.</p><p>If you take the boring layout</p><p>0^^ 1^^ 2^^ 3^^ 4^^ 5^^ 6^^ 7^^ 8^^ 9^^ 0^^^<br/>0^  1^  2^  3^  4^  5^  6^  7^  8^  9^  0<br/>0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0v<br/>0v  1v  2v  3v  4v  5v  6v  7v  8v  9v  0w<br/>0w  1w  2w  3w  4w  5w  6w  7w  8w  9w  0vw</p><p>Anything number with a symbol after it would be a black key, the nominals<br/>white keys.  Or any other colour pair; I happen to favour red and yellow.<br/> If you were reading from a decimal score, your eye would immediately be<br/>drawn to the nominals, and the amount by which you had to move your finger<br/>to get to the accidentals would correspond to the number of ^ or v symbols<br/>you see.  It would also help to be able to move the &quot;white&quot; keys to match<br/>the key signature -- which could be pretty much anything.</p><p>Another idea would be to avoid the upward drift by breaking the generality<br/>in the same place it&apos;s broken by the notation.  Then the middle row would<br/>always be the nominals, and you remap the tuning according to the key<br/>signature.  The standard tuning would then be:</p><p>0^^ 1^^ 2^^ 3^^ 4^^ 5^^ 6^^ 7^^ 8^^ 9^^ 0^^<br/>0^  1^  2^  3^  4^  5^  6^  7^  8^  9^  0^<br/>0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0<br/>0v  1v  2v  3v  4v  5v  6v  7v  8v  9v  0v<br/>0w  1w  2w  3w  4w  5w  6w  7w  8w  9w  0w</p><p>There&apos;d have to be some way of flagging the octaves visually.  Partly to<br/>make the break clear, so that you remember to adjust fingering.  Also to<br/>have something to orient you to the keyboard.  I think I prefer the drift,<br/>but it&apos;s an idea.<br/>&grave;<br/>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=22653 href="#22653">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/13/2001 9:27:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22370.html#22432">/tuning/topicId_22370.html#22432</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; ! blackjack.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich, Tuning list ~5-May-2001, 7/72 octave generator<br/>&gt;  21<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  33.3333333<br/>&gt;  116.6666667&#x9;<br/>&gt;  150.0&#x9;<br/>&gt;  233.3333333&#x9;<br/>&gt;  266.6666667&#x9;<br/>&gt;  350.0&#x9;<br/>&gt;  383.3333333&#x9;<br/>&gt;  466.6666667&#x9;<br/>&gt;  500.0&#x9;<br/>&gt;  583.3333333&#x9;<br/>&gt;  616.6666667&#x9;<br/>&gt;  700.0&#x9;<br/>&gt;  733.3333333&#x9;<br/>&gt;  816.6666667&#x9;<br/>&gt;  850.0&#x9;<br/>&gt;  933.3333333&#x9;<br/>&gt;  966.6666667&#x9;<br/>&gt;  1050.0&#x9;<br/>&gt;  1083.333333&#x9;<br/>&gt;  1166.666667&#x9;<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, again, to Dave Keenan for providing this Scala text file.
