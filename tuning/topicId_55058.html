Maybe<br/>this could be a useful kind of &quot;how to&quot;<br/>help for making newbie definitions.</p><p>So for wedge product ones list may be<br/>simply</p><p>1)<br/>learn how to calculate the wedge product<br/>by hand.</p><p>In that case Dave Keenan&apos;s definition<br/>is just fine. No more is needed.</p><p>Not sure what you need in the dictionary<br/>with this approach, probably no more than</p><p>wedgie:<br/>useful mathematical tool for tuning<br/>theory - see encyclopedia for method<br/>of calculation.</p><p>But maybe you want<br/>1) learn the connection of wedge products with areas<br/>and volumes<br/>2) learn the applications of those to some<br/>tuning situations such as finding the<br/>area of a periodicty block or (... give<br/>more applications)<br/>3) Understand the representation of a wedge<br/>product in terms of wedge products of unit<br/>vectors.<br/>4) learn how to do the calculations by hand.</p><p>In that case more is needed. A newbie<br/>reading Dave Keenan&apos;s explanation simply<br/>can&apos;t be expected to learn anything from<br/>it except 4). I didn&apos;t from reading it.<br/>You couldn&apos;t possibly read that and<br/>at the end of it know that the<br/>wedge product of the syntonic comma<br/>and the diesis is the number of notes<br/>in a five limit scale with those<br/>as unison vectors - it doesn&apos;t make<br/>any connection at all with pitches<br/>and unison vectors. That&apos;s not a<br/>criticism at all - it is a post he did<br/>in response to a request to explain<br/>how to calculate the wedge product<br/>so that is what he did, simply<br/>and straighforwardly. But more is needed<br/>that&apos;s all.</p><p>Then having decided what you want the<br/>newbie to be able to learn, or a<br/>list of things you would like to be<br/>learnt, then try and order them from<br/>the familiar and useful to the less<br/>familiar.</p><p>This will seem completely back to<br/>front mathematically, but it is<br/>how it needs to be done if it<br/>is to be user friendly.</p><p>so<br/>1) learn one simple application and<br/>show an example of how it works<br/>- best to be a 2D application probably<br/>as simpler to explain, and needs<br/>to be simple but not so simple as to<br/>have no obvious application.</p><p>2) explain how it is calculated<br/>for that one application so that<br/>they now already have a useful tool.</p><p>3) learn the connection with areas<br/>and volumes for the general case<br/>so that they understand the concept<br/>intuitively - I think this is helpful<br/>so that they have some understanding.<br/>Just saying that it is a directed<br/>area and gives the parallelogram area swept<br/>out is fine.</p><p>4) more detailed explanation and<br/>description of how to calculate it.</p><p>There 4) and some of 3) are more<br/>suitable for the encyclopedia than<br/>the dictionary.</p><p>Now, write out the newbie<br/>style definition a first draft.<br/>Look at it and try to find ways of<br/>making it use natural language more<br/>and symbols less, if possible and not<br/>cumbersome. Also feel free to change<br/>the order again at that point.</p><p>The same thing needs to be done<br/>with vals by someone, and the other<br/>techy things presently. But probably<br/>not me, or not yet :-).</p><p>Possiby I could do it later though<br/>with all my other commitments<br/>unfortunately I simply don&apos;t<br/>have the time right now to<br/>devote much of it to learning<br/>tuning theory. As someone<br/>who is very fond of maths<br/>in all its forms, especially<br/>pure mahts, I&apos;d certainly<br/>enjoy doing it. also bear<br/>in mind that though I have<br/>kept active mathematically<br/>by thinking of things, it<br/>is maybe ten years or more<br/>since I did much serious maths<br/>research so I&apos;m a bit rusty<br/>at reading maths papers, and slow<br/>though that wuold come back<br/>very quickly I&apos;m sure if I had<br/>the time for a few months of<br/>solid maths reasearch.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2004 5:25:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; This is where the business of &quot;epimorphic&quot; scales comes in; when Scala<br/>&gt; says something is &quot;JI epimorphic&quot; and gives a val it means the val<br/>&gt; mapping order corresponds to the scale order.</p><p>Oh right.
