Several people designed WTs of this kind<br/>&gt;     and posted them, including George, Aaron Johnson, Gene,<br/>&gt;     and myself. Dave K. also had some very interesting things<br/>&gt;     to say, and I posted three batches of audio samples.<br/>&gt;     Gene gave equations that make it possible to find synch-<br/>&gt;     beating versions of any well temperament, and he put<br/>&gt;     some synch-tuned MIDI files on his site. Manuel added<br/>&gt;     beat ratios to Scala. I can&apos;t think how the response<br/>&gt;     could have been bigger.</p><p>Some of us, or maybe it&apos;s just me stuck in mud, fail to see how synchronous beating is of much use on any non-electronic instruments to be played by humans.  It&apos;s INTERESTING in an intellectual way, I guess, to know that the beating is theoretically lining up in there, but:</p><p>Who&apos;s ever gonna hear it and notice it on any non-electronic instrument?   The tones would have to be so consistently sustained, and so free of any fluctuation (as with an organ pipe or similar: the unavoidable random turbulence in the pitch), that there would be some chance of the synchronous beating to emerge from the texture.  And wouldn&apos;t the music have to be specially composed to take advantage of playing open and carefully-spaced intervals that happen to be interesting?  And most of all (maybe), wouldn&apos;t the notes have to be struck EXACTLY TOGETHER better than any human player is ever going to do, so the beating doesn&apos;t accidentally get out of phase for the entire duration of the held notes?</p><p>Maybe I&apos;m just over-reacting to the overemphasis of &quot;proportional beating triads&quot; in Owen Jorgensen&apos;s two books (as a way of tallying up some supposed superiority of &quot;proportional beating&quot; over &quot;theoretically correct&quot; versions of temperaments), but I&apos;ve always thought that that concept was pretty much a crock.  If the 5th and the 3rd in some triad are &quot;proportionally beating&quot; and the beating of both of them happens not to be zero (no pure 5th allowed here!), I don&apos;t see how it&apos;s of any musical use other than for PIANO tuners trying to set the temperament by ear in the first place -- which is indeed the thrust of Jorgensen&apos;s first book, the brown one.  Again, the notes aren&apos;t gonna be PLAYED by real human musicians exactly together, plus the temperament isn&apos;t gonna stay exactly on spot for more than a half day anyway, plus the listeners aren&apos;t going to pick out any &quot;proportional beating&quot; hearing it in ordinary music... so what&apos;s the point of striving for such a goal, beyond the (um...) intellectual stimulation?</p><p>For use in electronically-generated music, I have no objections.  That&apos;s not in my area of much interest, and those who fancy it more than I do are welcome to it.  I&apos;m just saying: &quot;the response could have been bigger&quot; if synchronous beating were a concept wherein I could see any practical use for it, on any of the instruments I play and tune.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=75820 href="#75820">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2008 9:33:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Who&apos;s ever gonna hear it and notice it on any non-electronic<br/>&gt; instrument?

Are some of you, with the phrase &quot;synchronous<br/>beating&quot;, referring to beats of a simple two-note interval that line up<br/>with the fundamental (or perhaps an overtone) of one or both notes,<br/>neatly into phase?  Or something else involving three or more notes?</p><p>My complaint was about the situation in some triad C-E-G wherein the C-E interval makes some beat rate (&quot;x&quot;), and the C-G interval makes some other beat rate (&quot;y&quot;), and the &quot;synchronous beating&quot; assumes some<br/>simple relationship between x and y such as 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, etc., making &quot;proportionally beating triads&quot;.  That is: the beats themselves line up and reinforce one another (presuming that they start at the same time!), regardless of what the three fundamentals and their other overtones are doing amongst themselves, and the &quot;synchronous beating&quot; of such a carefully chosen C-E-G is somehow &quot;better&quot; than the beating in some other C-E-G where x and y don&apos;t line up.  We supposedly get an orderly recurring pattern with these beat speeds in phase...and it&apos;s supposedly useful outside the process of tuning a piano by ear, where it&apos;s a convenience for checking intervals.</p><p>This measure of quality (from Owen Jorgensen&apos;s books, especially the first one, _Tuning the historical temperaments by ear_) is what I&apos;m saying is a crock, as far as I&apos;m concerned.  That&apos;s the type of example that is the context for my remarks: a major 3rd and a 5th each beating by some amount above the same bass note, and something pseudo-magical happening when those two beat rates coincide and can stay in phase...somehow prominently enough that somebody is going to hear and appreciate it.  &quot;Proportionally beating triads&quot; were to Jorgensen somehow &quot;better&quot; than triads in which the several beat speeds of 3rd and 5th have no obvious correlation.  And, many of the triads he tallied on his &quot;proportionally beating&quot; side had zero beats in either the 3rd or the 5th...so, indeed, there&apos;s no conflict of two different beat speeds competing with one another.  If either x or y is 0, the other one encounters no interference.  La-di-da!  Pythagorean triads count as &quot;proportionally beating&quot; (even though the 3rd is wildly sharp) just because anything goes within a pure 5th, with beat rate 0?!  And 1/4 comma meantone triads count as proportionally beating, even when the 5th has been sloppily done, because the 3rd has beat rate 0?!</p><p>Now, if &quot;synchronous beating&quot; in discussion *here* is about something other than such an argument, where two intervals are both reckoned from the same bass note and their beating x vs y is then compared for any synchronization, somebody, please explain what it &quot;is&quot;.</p><p>What is being synchronized here, and touted as &quot;more consonant&quot; than when &quot;synchronous beating&quot; isn&apos;t present?</p><p>Thank you,<br/>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=75843 href="#75843">ðŸ”—</a>Caleb Morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2008 8:42:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>1-well said, better than I could.

Or something else involving three or more notes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My complaint was about the situation in some triad C-E-G wherein<br/>the C-E<br/>&gt; interval makes some beat rate (&quot;x&quot;), and the C-G interval makes<br/>some<br/>&gt; other beat rate (&quot;y&quot;), and the &quot;synchronous beating&quot; assumes some<br/>&gt; simple relationship between x and y such as 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, etc.,<br/>making<br/>&gt; &quot;proportionally beating triads&quot;.  That is: the beats themselves<br/>line up<br/>&gt; and reinforce one another (presuming that they start at the same<br/>time!),<br/>&gt; regardless of what the three fundamentals and their other overtones<br/>are<br/>&gt; doing amongst themselves, and the &quot;synchronous beating&quot; of such a<br/>&gt; carefully chosen C-E-G is somehow &quot;better&quot; than the beating in some<br/>&gt; other C-E-G where x and y don&apos;t line up.  We supposedly get an<br/>orderly<br/>&gt; recurring pattern with these beat speeds in phase...and it&apos;s<br/>supposedly<br/>&gt; useful outside the process of tuning a piano by ear, where it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; convenience for checking intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This measure of quality (from Owen Jorgensen&apos;s books, especially<br/>the<br/>&gt; first one, _Tuning the historical temperaments by ear_) is what I&apos;m<br/>&gt; saying is a crock, as far as I&apos;m concerned.  That&apos;s the type of<br/>example<br/>&gt; that is the context for my remarks: a major 3rd and a 5th each<br/>beating<br/>&gt; by some amount above the same bass note, and something pseudo-<br/>magical<br/>&gt; happening when those two beat rates coincide and can stay in<br/>&gt; phase...somehow prominently enough that somebody is going to hear<br/>and<br/>&gt; appreciate it.  &quot;Proportionally beating triads&quot; were to Jorgensen<br/>&gt; somehow &quot;better&quot; than triads in which the several beat speeds of<br/>3rd and<br/>&gt; 5th have no obvious correlation.  And, many of the triads he<br/>tallied on<br/>&gt; his &quot;proportionally beating&quot; side had zero beats in either the 3rd<br/>or<br/>&gt; the 5th...so, indeed, there&apos;s no conflict of two different beat<br/>speeds<br/>&gt; competing with one another.

It *is* a &apos;proportional&apos;-beating temperament<br/>in that the major thirds are pure, therefore the 5th and the minor 3rd<br/>ar equally mistuned and their beats have a more or less simple ratio.<br/>(Any triad with a pure fifth also has some proportional beating<br/>quality...) But I believe the &apos;proportional beats&apos; are not the *main*<br/>reason it sounds distinctive.</p><p>The other two recordings are actually the old warhorse &apos;Kirnberger<br/>III&apos; - i.e. keep meantone for C-G-D-A-E and tune all the rest in pure<br/>fifths (or a minute amount flat around B-F#-C#). Very easy to convert<br/>one to the other. If I had had the energy to do ET I would have done,<br/>but KIII is a reasonable beginning for a crude kind of circulation.<br/>(Davitt Moroney&apos;s complete recording of Byrd is also in KIII, which I<br/>think was a misjudgement since basically none of his pieces require<br/>circulation.)</p><p>I don&apos;t think KIII has clear &apos;proportional&apos; relations except for C<br/>major (pure M3), and the chords with pure fifths.
