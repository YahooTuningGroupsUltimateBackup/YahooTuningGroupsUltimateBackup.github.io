I<br/>have been playing keyboards, guitar and bass guitar for a long while<br/>but always &quot;by ear&quot; Â– that is, I have no classic education, I can&apos;t<br/>read the staff well, and so on...</p><p>Recently Â– say, since last year Â– I have started to ask myself some<br/>of the questions that I have also found in this discussion group. I<br/>have worked on my curiosities with the background and the method of<br/>an experimental physicist, so perhaps my view is strongly oriented<br/>in such sense. However, I would like to share with you some of my<br/>questions and answers, hoping that they could be of common interest,<br/>and Â– in case Â– that someone of you could give me directions for a<br/>more correct approach, and criticize my point of view.</p><p>I would like to start with a question recently found on this group:<br/>why the 4:5:6 major triad sounds more consonant than the 10:12:15<br/>minor triad Â– the &quot;old chestnut&quot; question. But before that, I<br/>believe that a clarification about some physical concepts is needed.</p><p>Initially, following Von Helmholtz work, I have started regarding<br/>consonance as due to good overlapping of musical harmonics. After<br/>several considerations (not reported here and now) I tend now to<br/>conclude that this explanation is far not sufficient. The main<br/>argument seems to me that higher harmonics are too weak to account<br/>for the strong dissonance of many of the possible triads. I have<br/>tried to sample a number of musical instruments (piano, guitar,<br/>violin) and for all of them the intensity of harmonics higher than<br/>the third one is much (at least 10 dB) weaker than the fundamental<br/>or second harmonic. If you plot the amplitude spectrum on a linear<br/>scale, you can clearly see how weak such harmonics are compared to<br/>the fundamental. To my ear, instead, heard dissonance is strong, and<br/>concerns the fundamental, or the very first harmonics.</p><p>Then I turned to an explanation involving &quot;difference tones.&quot; I<br/>would like to stress that such tones can also be present when<br/>starting tones are pure, i.e. with no higher harmonics. At this<br/>point, from most of the discussion on the web and the literature<br/>that I could find, I see that there are two (physically different)<br/>concepts that are concerned, that is, beatings and intermodulation<br/>tones. Both of them lead to some &quot;difference tones,&quot; the origin and<br/>nature of which is, however, very different. I will try to explain<br/>this below; I apologize for some simple maths, that on the other<br/>hand is necessary to understand the core of the question.</p><p>Beatings Â– It is the phenomenon occurring when one tries to tune a<br/>string instrument like a guitar. By playing the same note on two<br/>adjacent (or anyway different) strings, if the two are not perfectly<br/>in tune one hears a &quot;beating&quot;, that is, a long-period modulation of<br/>LOUDNESS. [Note: in physics the word &quot;modulation&quot; means periodic<br/>change of some quantity, e.g. amplitude modulation (or loudness<br/>modulation in this case) is a periodic change of amplitude,<br/>frequency modulation is a periodic change of frequency, like in<br/>vibrato, and so on. In musical terminology, modulation is a change<br/>of tonality, that happens once and has no periodicity!] Beatings<br/>happen always between two tones, it is a process due to wave<br/>interference and does not need any nonlinear phenomenon to happen.<br/>Mathematically it is described by trigonometric reverse<br/>prosthaphaeresis formulae, e.g.:</p><p>sin a + sin b = 2sin[&half;(a + b)]cos[&half;(a - b)]</p><p>You can find those at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthaphaeresis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthaphaeresis</a></p><p>Intermodulation tones Â– If two tones get &quot;mixed&quot; in some way, that<br/>is, they are not just summed up like in the previous case, but are<br/>also multiplied with each other, sum and difference frequencies are<br/>generated. This process requires a nonlinear interaction between<br/>tones, therefore is not always present. Moreover, nonlinear<br/>processes need high intensities to become dominant compared to<br/>linear ones, or the other way around, they tend to vanish when<br/>intensity is decreased. Mathematically those are described by<br/>trigonometric prosthaphaeresis formulae, e.g.:</p><p>sin a sin b = &half;[cos(a - b) - cos(a + b)]</p><p>The difference with the previous one is the following: sum of two<br/>tones is what happens normally in nature, that is, a linear process<br/>with no dependency of intensity. Product of two terms arises when<br/>intensity increases and a nonlinear interaction is introduced. The<br/>nonlinear response (sum and difference tones) is usually small<br/>compared to the original tones. This is why, for instance, Tartini&apos;s<br/>third sound is weak. Instead, a beating is strong: if the intensity<br/>of beating waves is the same, wave interference also causes periodic<br/>nulling of loudness, that is, loudness oscillates between zero and a<br/>maximum value. This is surely a strong effect.</p><p>The main difference between the two phenomena is exactly related to<br/>the different nature of produced tones. Intermodulation tones are<br/>two additional tones, the frequency of which is exactly the sum and<br/>the difference of the two starting frequency, and the amplitude of<br/>those will be much smaller of the two starting amplitudes (but will<br/>depend on the overall loudness). You will hear four tones at the<br/>same time: the two starting ones, plus the sum and difference tones.<br/>In beatings instead, you will hear only two tones, that is, the<br/>starting ones. However, the way they sum up is such that you hear<br/>a &quot;mean tone&quot; (whose frequency is proportional to &half; (a+b), that is<br/>the average of the two) with a loudness envelope at frequency<br/>proportional to (a-b). [Note: Actually, what we hear is a beating at<br/>frequency (a-b) and not &half; (a-b) because the loudness envelope is at<br/>twice the frequency of the wave envelope, it needs a sketch to<br/>understand this but please trust for the moment.] Therefore, in<br/>guitar tuning the two tones are very close, then the &quot;mean tone&quot; is<br/>about the same, and the beating is at very low frequency but it can<br/>still be heard just because it is a loudness modulation Â– and not an<br/>instantaneous pressure modulation, that would be beyond the audible<br/>frequency range.</p><p>I would very much appreciate your feedback, and if you were<br/>interested in discussing this issue, we could also talk about how<br/>this could be relevant, in my opinion, for harmonic analysis.</p><p>Best wishes of a happy 2009 to everybody,</p><p>Max Labardi</p></div><h3><a id=79753 href="#79753">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>1/7/2009 1:36:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

the &quot;old chestnut&quot; question.</p><p>---To my ear, instead, heard dissonance is strong, and<br/>---concerns the fundamental, or the very first harmonics.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sethares formula for dissonance pretty much says the same thing IE dissonance is scaled/multiplied by the amplitude of the tone (so those first few overtones matter the most in terms of determining consonance).&nbsp; So it makes sense...</p><p>Major triad is composed of<br/>root<br/>5/4 * 2 = 5/2 (first overtone)<br/>3/2 * 2 = 3 (first overtone)</p><p>root<br/>6/5 * 2 = 12/5 (first overtone)<br/>3/2 * 2 = 3 (first overtone)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, note, 5/2 is a perfect 5th on the next octave<br/> (right smack intersecting with not just the scale, but the harmonic series itself)...while 12/5 (minor triad) is not.&nbsp; Even that strong/loud second harmonic would begin to explain why the minor triad is more dissonant sounding.<br/>*****************************************************************************************************<br/>---Moreover, nonlinear<br/>---processes need high intensities to become dominant compared to<br/>---linear ones, or the other way around, they tend to vanish when<br/>---intensity is decreased.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, the higher overtones matter less (and the non-linear beating they produces thus matters less)...if I am following what you are saying.<br/>****************************************************************************************<br/>---which is exactly the sum and<br/>---the difference of the two starting frequency<br/>AKA the second heard &quot;tone&quot; is produced by beating between the root and &quot;1st&quot;<br/> tone....and the difference can be used to calculate the rate if beating...again, if I am still following you correctly.</p><p>---Therefore, in<br/>---guitar tuning the two tones are very close, then the &quot;mean tone&quot; is<br/>---about the same<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm...I wonder how this figures in...you seem to be describing a circumstance that would produce very slow beating that could easily be seen as a gradual change in amplitude.&nbsp; I do know that slow beating is generally considered pleasant, while fast beating is not.&nbsp; Sethares&apos; consonance formula points to that...it is the tones relatively close to the root frequency, and not those &quot;virtually on it&quot;...that cause the worst dissonance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I do know, that when all the beating produced by several tones in a scale played together are the same distance away IE beat at the same rate against each other...the result is pleasant/consonant (such is the case with the<br/> harmonic series which is root note, root note * 2, root note * 3, root note * 4....).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were to try and sum it up I would say something like<br/>&quot;The major triad is more tonal because the overtones of the second harmonic of its second note intersect with the harmonically beating (and pleasant) harmonic series and the minor triads second note does not.&nbsp; Plus, since the first and second tones have the most amplitude they have the most effect on consonance so there is little need to worry about whether or not higher octaves of a tone in each chord also intersect the harmonic series.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=79754 href="#79754">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2009 1:46:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

So you would think it would not matter so long as the instruments you use with the triads are just pure sine waves.</p><p>      Sorry to be suddenly so open to you but I&apos;m just surprised that you can say you would think it wouldn&apos;t matter. Personally, what I&apos;m often hearing very clearly, while listening to JI intervals, is the common fundamental; and a bit less clearly I can hear the actual difference tones; and, even less clearly than that, second difference tones (meaning frequencies of 2x*y and 2y*x). If you tak&eacute; 400:500:600Hz, for example, then the common fundamental is 100Hz, the difference tone in the lower interval is also 100Hz, the difference tone in the upper interval is also 100Hz, the difference tone between the highest and the lowest tone is 200Hz, and the second difference tones are 200Hz, 300Hz, 400Hz, 600Hz, 700Hz, and 800Hz, which means that ALL of them are multiples of 100Hz and therefore the periodicity is very clearly audible and the frequency of 100Hz is very prominent, even though it&apos;s not actually being intentionally &quot;emitted&quot;. On the other side, if you try 1000:1200:1500Hz, then the common fundamental is 100Hz, the difference tone in the lower interval is 200Hz, the difference tone in the upper interval is 300Hz, the difference tone of the highest and the lowest tone is 500Hz, and the second difference tones are 800Hz, 500Hz, 900Hz, 1400Hz, 2000Hz, and 1800Hz. Obviously, the fifth of 1000:1500Hz has a bit stronger difference tone than a third because its difference tone is equal to its fundamental and will be therefore a bit more &quot;pronounced&quot;, giving more emphasis on itself rather than making all the intervals equally significant. Anyway, what this means is actually that while a major triad of C4-E4-G4 has an &quot;acoustical fundamental&quot; of C2, the &quot;acoustical fundamental&quot; of a minor triad of C4-Eb4-G4 is Ab0, which is certainly not the same as the harmonic fundamental, for one thing, and, for another thing, is more than 3 octaves lower than the sounding tones. The fact that classical harmony determines the fundamental tone according to the position of the fifth is just a proof of what I&apos;ve said.</p><p>      Petr</p><p>      b&quot; :16:.....</p><p>      in reference to theirs common fundamental root 1:1,<br/>      two octaves below C.</p><p>      That view even answers Veroli&apos;s/Tom&apos; s quest in:<br/>      <a href="http://launch">http://launch</a>. <a href="http://groups.yahoo">groups.yahoo</a>. com/group/ tuning/message/ 79725<br/>      &quot;One hoary old unanswered question I bumped<br/>      into reading the first few dozen pages:<br/>      Why is 4:5:6 more consonant than 10:12:15?&quot;</p><p>      simply by Werckmeister&apos; s, Euler&apos;s &amp; Helmholtz&apos;s argument<br/>      that combinations of lower partials out of the harmonic series<br/>      do sound more consonant than choices among higher components:<br/>      http://sonic- <a href="http://arts.org/">arts.org/</a> monzo/euler/ euler-en. htm</p><p>      bye<br/>      A.S.</p></div><h3><a id=79782 href="#79782">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2009 6:10:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;      Sorry to be suddenly so open to you but I&apos;m just surprised<br/>&gt;that you can say you would think it wouldn&apos;t matter.

In particular,<br/>we use changing overtone structure (different resonant filters)<br/>to communicate vowels.  The ability to infer a single source<br/>with changing qualities (like different vowels) from rapidly-<br/>changing partial complexes produced in human vocalization is<br/>paramount to human survival.  Therefore it may make sense that<br/>our hearing apparatus is programmed to dissect partial<br/>complexes containing *harmonic relationships*, since those are<br/>found in nature and especially in human speech.  Subharmonic<br/>relationships (like those created in minor or utonal chords),<br/>on the other hand, are nowhere found in nature.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=79791 href="#79791">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2009 1:55:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl wrote:</p><p>&gt; To what mechanism do you attribute this &quot;common fundamental&quot;?</p><p>To the unremovable synchronicity of the beats.

Similarly as the bands around the &quot;split guide tone&quot; (I&apos;m saying &quot;split&quot; because getting away from JI splits the guide tone actually into two different frequencies very close to each other) start beating fast at that moment (which is what tuners count to get tempered intervals), the &quot;split fundamental&quot; also starts beating, but obviously at a much slower rate.</p><p>I should also point out that the fundamental frequency is very well audible even with sharp timbres full of loud overtones while the difference tones are better heard in timbres with soft overtones like flutes or pipe organs played with single pipe registers, for example. What&apos;s more, all of these &quot;special&quot; tones are best heard when there are only two sounding tones. The more tones you add, the more they get &quot;hidden&quot; by these because the sounding tones are obviously much louder.</p><p>&gt; &gt; On the other side, if you try 1000:1200:1500Hz, then the common<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamental is 100Hz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not 500 Hz?</p><p>That would be the case of the fifth in this example because it&apos;s the GCD of the highest and the lowest sounding frequency.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=79796 href="#79796">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2009 6:02:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

If you try playing 11TET with normal instruments with normal partials (which clash) and then compare it to Sethares &quot;Blue Dabo Girl&quot; done in 11TET with partials skewed to match...you&apos;ll notice a huge gain in musical consonance IE partial intersection is a large part of the problem...but certainly fixing it does not fix the whole thing or guarantee the mind will easily find a base tone and thus register the chords as &quot;tonal&quot;.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, you&apos;ll notice there is still a lot of consonance lacking between that and a piece with JI interval chords IE only part of the problem is solved.</p><p>--- On Fri, 1/9/09, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt;

I<br/>found Chris&apos; test very interesting, perhaps because as an<br/>experimental physicist I like making direct testsÂ….. starting from<br/>this, I&apos;ll tell you what I think about the issue of consonance of<br/>triads, and ask Chris, if he likes and has time, to &quot;explore&quot; a bit<br/>more....</p><p>I have tried to analyze consonance of triads by the following<br/>hypothesis: loudness beatings (that I have been mentioning in my<br/>previous post) are perceived by the ear, along with the mean tone.<br/>This seems well assessed to me, since the widely accepted definition<br/>of critical band (Plomp &amp; Levelt) states that the beating note of a<br/>dyadic chord should be out of a certain critical band of frequency<br/>to sound not dissonant. In other words, when the beating frequency<br/>is within a certain frequency range, it is perceived as &quot;annoying.&quot;<br/>This means that it can be assumed that loudness modulations (=<br/>beatings) are perceived by the ear as sounds themselves. [Note: this<br/>point of my analysis is, in my opinion, questionable. To the ear<br/>there must be difference between a tone at frequency &quot;a&quot; and a tone<br/>at frequency &quot;b&quot; much greater than &quot;a,&quot; the loudness of which is<br/>modulated at a rate &quot;a.&quot; However, let me proceed on this route.]</p><p>Let us start from the fact that a dyadic chord gives always raise to<br/>a beating (lower frequency, loudness modulation) and a mean tone<br/>(higher frequency, sine wave tone). The fifth interval (1,3/2) (is<br/>my notation acceptable?) has a beating at frequency &half; and a mean<br/>tone at frequency 5/4. Both the beating frequency and mean tone<br/>belong to the harmonic series etc etc. This can be also interpreted<br/>in terms of &quot;virtual pitch:&quot; we can hear either the dyadic chord as<br/>(1,3/2) or as (1/2,5/4) (bearing in mind that the tone &half; is actually<br/>a loudness modulation and not a &quot;real&quot; tone!). How the brain choses<br/>between the two possibilities could be an important part of the<br/>issue, but I have absolutely no background to comment on that!</p><p>Let us now move to triads. The simplest case is a triad (1,x,3/2)<br/>with the mediant (middle tone of the triad) to be determined. I have<br/>looked for the most consonant mediants by asking for the following<br/>requirements:</p><p>a.&#x9;The tones of the triad should belong to the scale.<br/>b.&#x9;The beating tones of each of the dyads composing the triad<br/>(that is: (1,x),(x,3/2), (1,3/2)) should be the same or multiples of<br/>each other, with the smallest possible ratio.<br/>c.&#x9;The beating tone should belong to the triad, or at least to<br/>the scale.<br/>d.&#x9;The mean tones should belong to the triad, or at least to<br/>the scale.</p><p>This just means that, in any case, if such annoying beatings were to<br/>exist, one could think that they could be less annoying<br/>if &quot;simplified.&quot; Perhaps my approach is too na&iuml;ve, however let us<br/>just use it for the natural scale and see what is the response to<br/>the &quot;old chestnut&quot; question about different consonance of major and<br/>minor chords. Let&apos;s see how it works.</p><p>In the case of the Just Intonation (natural) scale, one should<br/>expect the most consonant chords. If we look for beating tones in<br/>small ratios between each other, we require that:</p><p>(x-1)=n1(3/2-x)  this means that the beating tone between mediant<br/>and tonic is required to be n times the beating tone between the<br/>fifth and the mediant; [Note: the more general form would use two<br/>integers, like n1a(x-1)=n1b(3/2-x), but I prefer to use one index n1<br/>that can assume integer or rational values]</p><p>(3/2-1)=n2(x-1) the same for the dyads fifth-tonic and mediant-tonic;</p><p>(3/2-1)=n3(3/2-x) the same for fifth-tonic and fifth-mediant.</p><p>I have tried with n = 1,2,3,1/3,1/2, 2/3 and 3/2, but of course one<br/>can use higher (or more complicated) ratios. You can find that there<br/>are three mediants x that provide solutions for all three equations<br/>(with n1,n2 and n3 within the given ensamble):</p><p>x=5/4, for n1=1, n2=2, n3=2;<br/>x=4/3, for n1=2, n2=3/2, n3=3;<br/>x=7/6, for n1=1/2, n2=3, n3=3/2.</p><p>There are also solutions to just two or one of those, but I guess<br/>they would provide worse consonance than the ones fulfilling all<br/>three equations.</p><p>The far simplest one is the first, that is the standard major triad<br/>(1,5/4,3/2), where the ratios n are the smallest (1 Â– 2 Â– 2). For<br/>such triad, the beatings analysis fits well with the rules of<br/>consonance that I have found in classic harmony texts, where<br/>difference frequencies are calculated for each dyadic chord. For<br/>instance, the interval (1,3/2) gives beating = &half;, that is the tonic<br/>1 octave below the fundamental (but remember: it is not a real tone,<br/>but a loudness modulation). (1,5/4) gives &frac14;, that is the tonic 2<br/>octaves below the fundamental. (5/4,3/2) gives &frac14;, that is again the<br/>tonic 2 octaves below. Then we see that all three beatings are tones<br/>belonging to the triad, and also to the scale.</p><p>Let us now determine the mean tones. They are also rather good:<br/>(1,3/2) gives 5/4, that belongs to the triad; (1,5/4) gives 9/8,<br/>that belongs to the scale; (5/4,3/2) gives 11/8, that in this case<br/>does not belong to the scale.</p><p>The second triad is the one with x = 4/3. With the same procedure,<br/>the &quot;sus4&quot; triad (1,4/3,3/2) is consonant with beating index (2 Â–<br/>3/2 Â– 3). They are not as small and nice as in the first case, but<br/>still acceptable. The tones corresponding to such beatings are &half;,<br/>the tonic 1 octave below, 1/3, the fourth 2 octave below, and 1/6,<br/>the fourth 3 octaves below. In this case, the beatings again belong<br/>to the triad, although only one of them is the <a href="http://tonic.As">tonic.As</a> for the mean<br/>tones, we have 5/4 (that belongs to the scale but no longer to the<br/>triad), 7/6 and 17/12, that both do not belong to the scale (even<br/>from the minor scale, if we consider the minor third being 6/5).</p><p>Finally, the third triad with x=7/6 is (1,7/6,3/2), I will call it a<br/>minor triad. The tone 7/6 does not belong to the natural scaleÂ…. So<br/>this shoud discourage us. However, the beating index is (1/2,3,3/2),<br/>so comparably simple to the 4sus triad. Beating tones are &half;, 1/6 and<br/>1/3, but in this case the fourth does not belong to the triad. Mean<br/>tones are 5/4, 13/12 (not belonging to the scale) and 4/3, that<br/>belongs to the scale but not to the triad.</p><p>What about the minor triad 10:12:15? That would correspond to<br/>(1,6/5,3/2). This triad is not a solution of our equations for the<br/>simplest beating index. The beating index corresponding to this<br/>case, would be (2/3 Â– 5/2 Â– 5/3). This really looks more complicated<br/>than the previous ones! Let us calculate the difference tones: &half;,<br/>that is (as usual) in the triad; 1/5 (this introduces a minor sixth<br/>3 octaves below) that is in the scale but not in the triad, and 3/10<br/>(a minor third 2 octaves below) that is in the triad. Mean tones are<br/>5/4 (that belongs to the scale but, this time, not to the triad),<br/>11/10 and 27/10, that both do not belong to the scale.</p><p>To conclude, this kind of analysis tells us the following: if the<br/>beatings coincidence were to rule the consonance of a triad, one<br/>would expect the major triad to be the most consonant, followed by<br/>the 4sus. Below is the minor triad with 7/6 minor third, although<br/>such tone does not to the natural scale. After, the classic minor<br/>triad with 6/5 minor third. One should judge which of those is more<br/>consonant.</p><p>If, instead, also the absolute coincidences of beating tones and<br/>mean tones with the tones of the triad and of the scale were<br/>important, then there would be different combinations to take into<br/>account, but from the overall appearance of the results, I would say<br/>that the rank of consonance given above should be respected as well.</p><p>One could replace the fifth 3/2 with some different frequency, to<br/>analyze harmonic behavior of different kinds of triads, e.g.<br/>reversed) as well as of n-TETs more carefully. For instance, for 12-<br/>TET with a fifth of 1.49831 you find out 1.2492 for the major triad,<br/>1.3322 for the 4sus and 1.1661 for the minor triad (compare with the<br/>frequencies of the 12-TET scale 1.2599, 1.3348 and 1.1892). For 17-<br/>TET, with a fifth of 1.50341, you find 1.2517, 1.3356 and 1.1678<br/>(compare with 1.2772, 1.3303, 1.1771). You see that for 12-TET there<br/>is more difference for the minor triad (1.1661 vs 1.1892) than for<br/>the major one (1.2492 vs 1.2599), that is, in 12-TET Â– according to<br/>the above criteria of consonance of course! Â– the minor triad should<br/>sound more dissonant than the major triad. For the 17-TET instead,<br/>there is more difference for the major triad (1.2517 vs 1.2772) than<br/>for the minor triad (1.1678 vs 1.1771), that is, in 17-TET the major<br/>triad should sound more dissonant than the minor triad. Actually I<br/>have to say that I consider more dissonant the minor triad in 12-TET<br/>and the major triad in 17-TET. For sure I can say that, because I<br/>have refretted a classic guitar with 17-TET and the minor triad<br/>sounds nicer, in my opinion, than the standard one, while the major<br/>triad is a bit annoying, especially in some positions on the<br/>fretboard. Perhaps the different sound in different positions could<br/>be due to the role of higher harmonics?Â…</p><p>Indeed, when we introduce the role of the higher harmonics,<br/>everything becomes more complex. But all the considerations valid<br/>for a given triad (combination of three fundamental tones) is also<br/>valid for each of the higher harmonics (the triad of second<br/>harmonics, the triad of third harmonicsÂ….). Additionally, there is<br/>also overlapping of different harmonic orders that completes the<br/>whole stuff, but in my opinion, at this point, it becomes secondary Â–<br/> I mean that if I hear more or less consonance just on the basis of<br/>the fundamental tones, to introduce higher harmonics won&apos;t change<br/>the results too much, since they are much weaker after all. If you<br/>have a look at Chris&apos; spectra, you see how higher harmonics are at<br/>least 12 dB lower than the fundamental. Of course this should be<br/>measured on a &quot;physical&quot; instrument, not a generator, but I have<br/>tried that and the result shows, as well known, that harmonics are<br/>at least 10 dB weaker than the fundamental.</p><p>So, a proposal for exploration is to try the 7/6 minor triad with no<br/>overtones and with them, as Chris already did (actually, all these<br/>tests should be performed in Just Intonation). One should try to<br/>realize whether the fact that 7/6 is not on the natural scale is<br/>more important than the fact that beating index is a simple one and<br/>that beating tones, as well as two of the three mean tones, belong<br/>to the scale.</p><p>Max</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chris Vaisvil&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, I put together a series that some of you may find interesting<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://soonlabel.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1231472075">http://soonlabel.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1231472075</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/9hzzlt">http://tinyurl.com/9hzzlt</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did what Carl suggested and played around with pure sines, and<br/>also with<br/>&gt; pure triangles.<br/>&gt; I only had time to do this in 12 TET.<br/>&gt; *<br/>&gt; *By using an oscilloscope program I captured the FFT spectrum of C<br/>major C<br/>&gt; minor and C sus 4th.<br/>&gt; There is a music example as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also did the same with a triangle wave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a screen shot of cool edit you can see the beating or<br/>roughness of the<br/>&gt; chord.

The calculated fundamentals of each dyad<br/>analyzed separately will end up being in a harmonic series of the<br/>fundamental of the whole chord, and when one overtone of the real VF<br/>dominates, you might be inclined to hear that as the fundamental.</p></div><h3><a id=79808 href="#79808">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2009 12:32:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chris Vaisvil&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; can I trouble you to post the chords again?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; please note the korg only has 4 note polyphony (a big flaw but<br/>&gt; the keyboard itself does more) so only 4 notes per chord please</p><p>Then use 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4, and 1/1 7/6 7/5 7/4.

If I listen to a chord of 300:500:700:900:1100Hz, I can very &quot;brightly&quot; hear 100Hz and, slightly less &quot;brightly&quot;, also 200Hz -- I mean, as long as the overtones are rather soft. If they are loud, the frequency of 100Hz will sound much more &quot;pronounced&quot; to me than 200Hz. Similarly, when I hear 200:500:800:1100:1400Hz, I can clearly hear 100Hz there and less clearly I can hear 300Hz. In both cases, the first one is the GCD frequency and the second one is the difference frequency. I&apos;ve asked a few other people about what tones thei were hearing when I played similar examples to them, and all of them chose the fundamental (i.e. the GCD) frequency as the most &quot;prominent&quot; one. Yes, it&apos;s true that all of them worked either in the field of acoustics or composing music, I&apos;ve not tried so far to ask more than a few people.</p><p>&gt; There is no such mathematical definition of the virtual<br/>&gt; fundamental (which is the result of a stochastic process in<br/>&gt; your brain... but you can measure the likelihood of it coming<br/>&gt; out the same every time with harmonic entropy).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what a &quot;common fundamental&quot; is.</p><p>If there were no mathematical definition of the fundamental frequency or tone (I&apos;m not talking about the VF right now), then I&apos;d ask why so many people including Fokker and Partch gave so much significance to it.

Whenever I hear some of the &quot;combination tones&quot; or whatever, I first listen to find out, as exactly as I can, in what intervals these are away from the sounding tones. And if I really DO care about the frequency relationships, sometimes I do a bit of quick maths to convert the exponential interval sizes to linear frequency relationships. For example, recently, I&apos;ve experimented with some sine wave &quot;peculiarities&quot; and ran 1800Hz and 2500Hz through my headphones. When I played the sound pretty loud and then converted the intervals I could hear into linear ratios, it turned out I was actually able to hear 1100, 700, and 400Hz there.

Suppose you mix a set of equally loud static sinusoidal waves (or, more precisely, cosine waves) which have frequencies of 3:7:11:15:19:23Hz and so on and so on, up to the highest frequency you can hear, or (if we work on a digital sampling level) the highest frequency which the actual sampling rate makes possible to transmit. What you get is a single full-volume impulse at the very begining, then after 0.25 seconds you get this impulse phase-shifted by -90 degrees, which, in the case of digital sampling, results in a DHT (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform#Discrete_Hilbert_transforms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform#Discrete_Hilbert_transforms</a>), then after 0.5 seconds you get the impulse phase shifted by 180 degrees (which is essentially the same as inverting its polarity), and after 0.75 seconds you get the impulse phase-shifted by +90 degrees, which again, in the case of digital sampling, results in an inverted version of the DHT. This means that there are actually two kinds of periodicity, one of 1Hz and the other of 4Hz, even though neither of these frequencies is actually present. Now imagine all of this played 100 times faster. Don&apos;t know about you, but I can clearly hear 100Hz in such a sound and slightly less clearly also 400Hz. If you want, you can download an experiment of mine where I tried something similar with phase shifts of 0, -120, and +120 degrees. In order the impulses were possible to clearly separate, I left the general periodicity way below our hearing range. In this example, 4Hz is the lowest frequency present and 6Hz is the difference between consecutive frequencies, which results in an actual period of 2Hz.

At some point, when the interval is wide enough, you cannot<br/>hear anymore the beatings, but intervals still are more or less<br/>pleasant to hear. In Plomp&amp;Levelt experiments, pure tones were used<br/>to determine most dissonant intervals, and this was done, as far as I<br/>know, with a continuum of frequency ratios. For some dissonant<br/>intervals, you don&apos;t hear the beating for sure, but still it sounds<br/>dissonant. So I am just saying: since beatings (at least the ones<br/>fast enough) give an unpleasant sensation, perhaps faster beatings<br/>(even if you don&apos;t realize they are there) do the same if within the<br/>critical band.</p><p>Now I also say: prosthapheresis formulae show superposition of two<br/>distinct tones is equivalent to a mean tone with an amplitude<br/>modulation on it. So, since (in the case of a dissonant interval of<br/>course) the mean tone is not annoying by itself, it must be made<br/>annoying by its loudness modulation - even if it is fast and you<br/>don&apos;t realize it.</p><p>I also understand (and I already arose this doubt in my previous<br/>post) that the ear cannot feel the beating frequency just as a FFT<br/>analyzer can&apos;t. If I have a resonator tuned at the beating frequency,<br/>and I play my interval, I am sure it will not resonate. Nonetheless,<br/>the waveform and mathematics itself show a periodicity, and it is<br/>because of this periodicity that a couple of tones played together<br/>sound dissonant while the frequency corresponding to their mean tone,<br/>when played alone and steadily, is not. But you are also right, you<br/>don&apos;t hear any mean tone when you play a fifth interval, and you<br/>don&apos;t hear any beats as well.</p><p>Let&apos;s say that in the following way. The two (beating) tones when<br/>inside the ear excite different parts of it. If frequencies are too<br/>close, the ear gets excited in adjacent sections and is not able to<br/>identify the tone, therefore the annoying sensation. But when the<br/>tones are sufficiently far apart (let&apos;s say, more than a minor third)<br/>there should be negligible superposition and the tones be well<br/>splitted. Let&apos;s think about a major triad; then, if I go slightly out<br/>of tune with the third, or the fifth, why does the triad get worse<br/>so &quot;quickly&quot; (by means of so small change of tune)? The only reason I<br/>could imagine was the conflict of beating frequencies of the three<br/>dyads with each other. I don&apos;t know well the mechanism of hearing, so<br/>I&apos;m stuck at this point. And my curiosity is limited to the<br/>fundamentals, no harmonics. What do you think?</p><p>To comment about some other points arosen:</p><p>I think we are not going to see combination tones in the FFT<br/>spectrum. A Fourier transformation is, by definition, extracting the<br/>amplitude and phase of single frequencies within a signal. One has to<br/>bear in mind that a single frequency exists only if the signal has<br/>infinite duration. In mathematical terms, you integrate the product<br/>of your signal with a reference cosine wave over an infinite time,<br/>and span all possible frequencies of the reference wave. The results<br/>for each reference wave compose the Fourier spectrum.</p><p>The explanation of why the beating (or amplitude modulation) does not<br/>show up in the Fourier spectrum is that it is not an oscillation<br/>itself, but a change of loudness. If you Fourier-transform the &quot;mean<br/>tone&quot; fa=(f1+f2)/2 with an amplitude modulation on it, you do not get<br/>the same result than Fourier-transforming the mean tone with constant<br/>amplitude. This last transform would give you exactly (f1+f2)/2,<br/>while the first would give you the couple of frequencies f1 and f2<br/>ONLY if the beating frequency is exactly fb=f1-f2 (by beating<br/>frequency I mean the frequency of repetition of loudness modulation,<br/>that is, the inverse of a period between two zeroes in amplitude). If<br/>you change the beating frequency fb while keeping the mean tone fixed<br/>fa, you will get two frequencies (different from f1 and f2) spaced by<br/>a frequency difference fb.</p><p>Now, if cool edit shows frequency beats, it means it is not<br/>performing Fourier transform, possibly something else. I have<br/>downloaded it to make some tests (not yet done). If you use a real<br/>spectrum analyzer, the beating should not show up.</p><p>Ring modulation, as far as I understand, is completely different. It<br/>is due to the two oscillators physically coupled to each other.<br/>However this is not necessarily a nonlinear effect, can be linear<br/>coupling. Think of two independent springs, and join them by a third<br/>spring. The system is physically modified, the resonance frequencies<br/>of single springs are lost and new resonant modes of the coupled<br/>system arise. For instance, if the two springs are identical,<br/>coupling between them splits their common resonant frequencies into<br/>two different ones. Depending on the geometry of the system, one of<br/>the two &quot;modes&quot; can be much less damped than the original one and<br/>provide therefore long-lasting tones. The tuning fork works on this<br/>principle (this is why you do not use a single bar, but instead a<br/>fork, to obtain the tuning tone). The amount of frequency separation<br/>depends on the amount of coupling.</p><p>Max</p></div><h3><a id=79859 href="#79859">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2009 12:22:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; That should be the VF, not difference tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The definition of the fundamental frequency being the GCD of<br/>&gt; the sounding frequencies is not something I&apos;ve made up in my<br/>&gt; mind, I&apos;ve read that more times from various sources, some of<br/>&gt; which also had a definition for the &quot;guide tone&quot; to be the LCM<br/>&gt; of the sounding frequencies, like, for example, this one:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/efg-e.html">www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/efg-e.html</a></p><p>I&apos;m not accusing you of making it up, I&apos;m asking you why<br/>you believed it.

With chords such as 7:9:11 for example,<br/>there is beating between the upper partials even when the chord<br/>is tuned exactly, but it is not unpleasant.  This must be partly<br/>due to the fact that only the upper partials are affected, and<br/>they are at much lower amplitudes than the 3rd and 2nd partials<br/>that are affected in the case of a mistuned 2:3.

As we have already agreed,<br/>such beatings do not show up in Fourier spectra.</p><p>Since the beatings are also heard at low volume, they can&apos;t be due to<br/>combination tones. Furthermore, combination tones would produce a<br/>pitch, that could not be heard at least in the case of 12-ET major<br/>triad, at 5 Hz or so.</p><p>But loudness modulations do exist, they are both heard, and visible<br/>on the waveform plot. I have tried to understand why are they<br/>generated. This goes along with my curiosity about why a major triad<br/>becomes dissonant by a small variation of the third. All I say<br/>concerns, as usual, pure tones only, no higher harmonics.</p><p>I have developed the sum of three cosine waves  by prosthaphaeresis<br/>formulae, by expressing</p><p>Cos(a)+Cos(b)+Cos(c) =</p><p>1/2(Cos(a)+Cos(b))+1/2(Cos(a)+Cos(c))+1/2(Cos(c)+Cos(b))=</p><p>Cos((a-b)/2)Cos((a+b)/2)+Cos((a-c)/2)Cos((a+c)/2)+Cos((c-b)/2)Cos<br/>((c+b)/2).</p><p>I started with the simple case of a:b:c proportional to 4:5:6. Then I<br/>shift b by a frequency deviation delta. I am not going into the maths<br/>here, but as a result, I see that the loudness of the triad is<br/>modulated by a frequency delta as well as by a frequency delta/2.</p><p>I have not extended the calculation for the case of minor triads but<br/>I guess that the effect would be similar. I will check calculations<br/>again but they seem reasonably simple and the results resemble what I<br/>see on the waveform (I see the beatings with a &quot;denser&quot; band around<br/>zero, that could be the beating at frequency delta, that should have<br/>a smaller AM depth). Beatings at low frequency do not show up in<br/>dyads, or let&apos;s say, their frequency is of the same order of<br/>magnitude of the one of the mean tone or of each of the composing<br/>tones; for instance, for 1:3/2 the beating would be at 1/2 and the<br/>mean tone at 5/4 of course. But with triads, a kind of &quot;beating<br/>between beatings&quot; can take place. If we move for instance the third<br/>of the major triad as 5/4 + delta, the beating frequency<br/>corresponding to the dyad 1:5/4+delta will be 1/4+delta, the one of<br/>the dyad 5/4 + delta : 3/2 will be 1/4 - delta, the beating of the<br/>dyad 1:3/2 is still 1/2. If we beat the first and the second, for<br/>instance, we get a difference of 2 delta. This is just as a<br/>simplification, the actual effect on the wave is seen from the<br/>complete result of calculations.</p><p>In the case of Chris&apos; samples made in equal temperament, the<br/>difference of fifth and third from the just intonation ones accounts<br/>for the heard low-frequency beat of the major triad. Perhaps, as from<br/>my starting guess already discussed with Carl, in the case that<br/>beatings become too fast and may be heard as a &quot;strange&quot; type of<br/>tone, this could also account for the slight dissonance effect of the<br/>minor triad; this explanation is not yet satisfying to me and I would<br/>like to explore this point further.</p><p>However, I would like to go on. Of course, beatings cannot fully<br/>account for consonance/dissonance, but may as well be part of it. As<br/>for the example suggested by Carl, I have tested by generating the<br/>waveforms by Mathemathica and playing them, so it is not reliable and<br/>we are waiting for Chris&apos; new sample. I had two different impressions<br/>in the case of 4:5:6:7 and 1/(4:5:6:7) and in the case 4:5:6:7:9:11<br/>and 1/(4:5:6:7:9:11), but to comment about this I would like to hear<br/>good quality sounds. However, I guess that Carl would like to show us<br/>that the difference tone coincidence (that one gets by taking equally-<br/>frequency-spaced tones in the chord, like the ones obtainable from<br/>the harmonic series) does not tell much, so in his example both<br/>chords have &quot;well synchronized difference tones&quot; but nevertheless one<br/>case is much more consonant than the other one, so &quot;difference tones<br/>(as well as coincidence of partials itself) are not all&quot;.</p><p>Finally, about the central topic of this discussion, just one<br/>comment. It has been explained that the most consonant chords fit the<br/>harmonic series at smallest terms. In this respect, the minor chord<br/>10:12:15 has rather high indices. The minor triad 6:7:9, that I found<br/>by optimizing beating ratios (see my previous post about Beatings and<br/>Consonance of triads) is placed lower on the harmonic series and<br/>maintains the fifth ratio; however, it is to be checked whether it<br/>will result more or less consonant than the 10:12:15 minor triad<br/>(indeed, I also asked Chris to play also such triad in pure tones,<br/>just to check that).</p><p>I hope this will stimulate further discussion.

Previously the existence of beating was<br/>written off as a failure of the basilar membrane to discern between<br/>fine pitch differences, but I&apos;ve long suspected there&apos;s more to it<br/>than that. By that logic, if the basilar membrane had infinitely fine<br/>frequency resolution, then we&apos;d never hear any changes in the sound<br/>over time - we&apos;d perceive all of sound as one static, unchanging sound<br/>throughout our lifetime! I suspect there is some neurological<br/>mechanism to explain why the brain sometimes &quot;flips&quot; its perspective<br/>on the incoming signal to hear it as a modulation envelope over a tone<br/>vs. different tones - something beyond critical band effects.</p><p>&gt; In the case of Chris&apos; samples made in equal temperament, the<br/>&gt; difference of fifth and third from the just intonation ones accounts<br/>&gt; for the heard low-frequency beat of the major triad.

If you take 5/4 and you widen it<br/>slowly, you&apos;ll hear the beating start. Keep widening it until you get<br/>to 9/7. At this point the 5/4 will sound uncomfortably sharp, and the<br/>beating will have gotten too fast to hear, as you put it... But if you<br/>stay on 9/7 for a second, you might experience a sudden perception<br/>shift whereas you suddenly realize that the &quot;beating&quot; is in a regular<br/>pattern, and then you&apos;ll suddenly become aware of the different<br/>fundamental and hear it as 9/7.</p><p>&gt; However, I would like to go on.

It has been explained that the most consonant chords<br/>&gt; fit the harmonic series at smallest terms. In this respect,<br/>&gt; the minor chord 10:12:15 has rather high indices. The minor<br/>&gt; triad 6:7:9, that I found by optimizing beating ratios (see my<br/>&gt; previous post about Beatings and Consonance of triads) is placed<br/>&gt; lower on the harmonic series and maintains the fifth ratio;<br/>&gt; however, it is to be checked whether it will result more or<br/>&gt; less consonant than the 10:12:15 minor triad (indeed, I also<br/>&gt; asked Chris to play also such triad in pure tones, just to check<br/>&gt; that).</p><p>Having used 6:7:9 chords on several instruments over the years,<br/>including several pianos, my own impression is that it is<br/>indeed more consonant, in a sense, than either 10:12:15 or<br/>16:19:24.  However, there are two things against it:</p><p>1. 7/6 is getting close to the critical band, and even in the<br/>middle of the piano, we hear some beating between its partials.<br/>As mentioned before, this beating is nicely synchronous, but<br/>it lends the interval to a somewhat &apos;tense&apos; feeling.  This can<br/>be a good thing for minor chords however.  :)</p><p>2. The chord is, in fact, low enough in the harmonic series<br/>that the implied fundamental is likely to be 4 (or 2 or 1<br/>depending on the voicing).  Compare my analysis of 10:12:15,<br/>where almost always 10 or 5 will be heard as the root, with<br/>the 12 being dismissed by the hearing system as unrecoverable<br/>(unless you listen to 15-chords all the time, as Mike seems<br/>to do, when you may hear 4 or 8 for the root. :)</p><p>In summary, 6:7:9 is an excellent minor chord and can be<br/>used even in performances of existing classical music.  But<br/>overall I think either 10:12:15 or 16:19:24 are to be<br/>preferred, because of their greater tendency to evoke a<br/>fundamental that is the same as the root (lowest tone, or<br/>octave extension of the lowest tone), in the chord.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=79932 href="#79932">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2009 7:42:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; 2.

I&apos;ve been taking Debussy&apos;s reverie<br/>and retuning it to 72tet, which, while not JI, is close enough for me<br/>to get the job done here. Not only are there comma pumps all over the<br/>place (vi-ii-V-I is particularly nasty, as is iim7-V7-I), but the<br/>10:12:15 minor chords don&apos;t always &quot;fit&quot; - sometimes it seems like<br/>16:19:24 is better. Same with major chords - sometimes a 12-tet major<br/>chord seems to sound better than 4:5:6, and I&apos;m not sure why. Maybe if<br/>it functions as the III chord of a 16:19:24 minor or something.</p><p>I gave 10:12:15 a better listen - that 4/8 fundamental is there, but<br/>indeed 5/10 stands out as the &quot;root&quot;. To me at least, I hear the root<br/>as 5/10, but that 4/8 is indeed there, but lower - I sort of feel like<br/>it&apos;s partially responsible for the &quot;quality&quot; of the chord. I don&apos;t<br/>think it&apos;s completely dismissed by the hearing system as<br/>unrecoverable, as 11/9 is if you play it low enough. That one I feel<br/>is completely thrown out the window.</p><p>BTW, what listening examples are people still waiting for? 11-limit<br/>major vs 11-limit minor in sines?

However, no 1 Hz SINE WAVE<br/>is present anywhere in that signal. When people refer to hearing a<br/>certain &quot;frequency&quot;, what they&apos;re really talking about is hearing a<br/>sine wave with that frequency. The brain, in certain circumstances,<br/>manages to artificially create that 1Hz frequency so that it DOES seem<br/>like we hear a sine wave there.&quot;<br/>I do understand that you&apos;re speaking about only a sine wave<br/>corresponding to the fundamental. It is that assumption that &quot;sine<br/>wave = frequency = fundamental&quot; that I find reductionist. However,<br/>someone did answer my question that it can be heard if the harmonic<br/>&quot;circumstances&quot; are in the range of human hearing, which is what I<br/>wanted to know. But even more to my point, I suspect that that GCD<br/>fundamental DOES make its presence felt in the very concept of KEY, so<br/>that there is nothing &quot;artificial&quot; about it at all, and in fact it<br/>might provide the vital clue to understanding musical harmony. The<br/>danger is that we experiment with chords out of musical context, only<br/>considering notes appearing simultaneously. How then do we &quot;model&quot;<br/>apeggios or entire orchestral pieces of music? (Leonard Bernstein<br/>makes the point that the reason why the teasing song &quot;ner ner na ner<br/>ner&quot;, you know from major 3 to 5th, is teasing is because we never get<br/>to hear the tonic).<br/>&gt;EG: Take the overtones from one note from 2 upwards, say an E note as<br/>5 from C = 1, giving 10, 15, etc... Then take the overtones from 2<br/>upwards from a G note as 6 from C, giving 12,18, and so on. What is<br/>interesting is that the pairs of 2nd, then 3rd etc... harmonics will<br/>all give GCD of the overtones of the fundamental C. In other words,<br/>each of these overtones is itself a GCD: 10 and 12 have 2, 15 and 18<br/>have 3, etc...And each of these GCD are overtones of the &quot;artificial&quot;<br/>frequency C = 1, which is itself the &quot;greatest&quot; GCD of them all.

Generally, what&apos;s most often called &quot;beats&quot; in tempered intervals is when some harmonics of one tone start clashing with different harmonics of another tone, which can&apos;t happen with sine waves that have no harmonics at all. For example, if I play two pitches simultaneously, one of 200Hz and another of 301Hz, then there will be 2 beats per second because the 3rd harmonic of the lower tone is 600Hz and the 2nd harmonic of the higher tone is 602Hz -- i.e. the guide tone (which would be 600Hz if the frequencies were 200 and 300) turned into two close frequencies, so close that we can hear beats.</p><p>&gt; I have developed the sum of three cosine waves by prosthaphaeresis<br/>&gt; formulae, by expressing<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cos(a)+Cos(b)+Cos(c) =<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/2(Cos(a)+Cos(b))+1/2(Cos(a)+Cos(c))+1/2(Cos(c)+Cos(b))=<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cos((a-b)/2)Cos((a+b)/2)+Cos((a-c)/2)Cos((a+c)/2)+Cos((c-b)/2)Cos<br/>&gt; ((c+b)/2).</p><p>Okay, I think you&apos;re on a good track. But summing cosines is useful for things like filtering, phase shifting, or making amplitude envelopes for sounds that are to be interpolated to prevent pops and clicks. But to prove the trigonometric identity that you were describing, it&apos;s usually better to use sines which, for one thing, have their starting point at 0 and, for another thing, can make distinction between positive and negative frequencies. So I would probably do it like this:<br/>sin(a)+sin(b)+sin(c) =<br/>1/2(sin(a)+sin(b))+1/2(sin(a)+sin(c))+1/2(sin(c)+sin(b))=<br/>sin((a+b)/2)*cos((a-b)/2) + sin((a+c)/2)*cos((a-c)/2) + sin((b+c)/2)*cos((b-c)/2)</p><p>&gt; I started with the simple case of a:b:c proportional to 4:5:6. Then I<br/>&gt; shift b by a frequency deviation delta. I am not going into the maths<br/>&gt; here, but as a result, I see that the loudness of the triad is<br/>&gt; modulated by a frequency delta as well as by a frequency delta/2.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid you couldn&apos;t argue with this. If you tak&eacute; two values of x and y, then the sum and difference values are x+y and x-y. If you make sum and difference values of that, you get 2x and 2y. AFAIK, this is true for any number.</p><p>If you are talking about the amplitude modulation itself, I don&apos;t think you could argue with that either, because the actual periodicity occurs at a frequency of &quot;delta&quot;, or at a time of, let&apos;s say, &quot;delta-t&quot;, and the length of the period by which the amplitude modulation is done to make this happen is just an integer multiple of this &quot;delta-t&quot; -- i.e. you could say, for example, that mixing two sine waves of 400Hz and 500Hz is the same as multipliing a 450Hz sine with a 50Hz cosine, but the phase patterns in such a sound repeat exactly the same every 10 miliseconds (i.e. every 100th of a second), and the time of 20 miliseconds (which is 1/50 of a second) is just an integer multiple of that, so I see no point in using that as a reference here.</p><p>&gt; I have not extended the calculation for the case of minor triads but<br/>&gt; I guess that the effect would be similar. I will check calculations<br/>&gt; again but they seem reasonably simple and the results resemble what I<br/>&gt; see on the waveform (I see the beatings with a &quot;denser&quot; band around<br/>&gt; zero, that could be the beating at frequency delta, that should have<br/>&gt; a smaller AM depth). Beatings at low frequency do not show up in<br/>&gt; dyads, or let&apos;s say, their frequency is of the same order of<br/>&gt; magnitude of the one of the mean tone or of each of the composing<br/>&gt; tones; for instance, for 1:3/2 the beating would be at 1/2 and the<br/>&gt; mean tone at 5/4 of course.</p><p>First of all, why say &quot;1:3/2&quot; when you can simply say &quot;3/2&quot;? And then, you&apos;re probably not using the right terminology -- what you describe is not beating.</p><p>&gt; But with triads, a kind of &quot;beating<br/>&gt; between beatings&quot; can take place. If we move for instance the third<br/>&gt; of the major triad as 5/4 + delta, the beating frequency<br/>&gt; corresponding to the dyad 1:5/4+delta will be 1/4+delta, the one of<br/>&gt; the dyad 5/4 + delta : 3/2 will be 1/4 - delta, the beating of the<br/>&gt; dyad 1:3/2 is still 1/2. If we beat the first and the second, for<br/>&gt; instance, we get a difference of 2 delta. This is just as a<br/>&gt; simplification, the actual effect on the wave is seen from the<br/>&gt; complete result of calculations.</p><p>These are difference tones, not beats.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=79939 href="#79939">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>1/14/2009 4:18:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr, with all due respect, why would the sine in a harmonic act differently than the sine in the fundamental?

Take the example of 8/5 and compare 13/8 to that. The distance between these two is 65/64 (which you can hear on your own by mixing a relative frequency of 40 with either 65 or 64), which is just about 27 cents in size; yet you won&apos;t hear one as a variation of the other because the entire characteristics of each dyad will differ substantially. For example, take a 400Hz tone and add 640Hz to it in one version and 650Hz in the other. Don&apos;t know about you, but the first change I would realize in that case would be the GCD (or fundamental) frequency change from 80 in the first version to 50 in the second one.

For instance, combinational tones (due only<br/>to some nonlinear effect involved in production, transmission or<br/>perception of sound) of two frequencies &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are frequencies<br/>a-b and a+b, and they are tones as well. With combinational tones<br/>you actually see the two new frequencies to appear in the spectrum,<br/>a difference tone and a sum tone, and their intensity relative to<br/>the source tones depends on volume.</p><p>Instead, beatings are periodical changes of the loudness of some<br/>other (typically faster) tone. Beating is a linear effect due to<br/>wave interference. It does not introduce new frequencies in the<br/>signal, that is, if you make a Fourier spectrum you don&apos;t see<br/>additional frequencies.</p><p>In my view, beatings are always beatings (linear wave interference)<br/>regardless their frequency. The fact that the ear cannot follow too<br/>rapid beatings does not change the nature of the stimulus. In other<br/>words, can a modulation of the amplitude of a pressure wave (that<br/>has itself a constant average pressure, that is the atmospheric<br/>pressure) turn into a time-dependent average pressure at the<br/>frequency of the beating? I think not, but this topic is actually<br/>what I am trying to understand.</p><p>Let&apos;s put it in different terms. Take two ultrasonic waves with an<br/>audible frequency difference (say 30000 Hz and 30100 Hz). We should<br/>be able to hear 100 Hz (we know it also from Tartini&apos;s third sound).<br/>But we hear that sound only because of nonlinear interaction inside<br/>our ear. If you lower the overall volume such effect should<br/>disappear.</p><p>So if you took a (hypothetical) guitar with two strings tuned at<br/>30000 and 30001 Hz, you do not hear any beating at 1 Hz, because you<br/>do not hear the frequency at 30000 Hz and therefore you do not hear<br/>its amplitude modulation! You can say the same with a detuning of<br/>100 Hz, that is in the audible range: if your guitar strings are<br/>tuned at 30000 and 30100 Hz, you do not hear any beating (although<br/>this time it is fast and within the audible range) just because you<br/>can&apos;t hear the frequency at 30000 Hz. Or do you? (note: if the<br/>volume is increased enough, as in the previous example of third<br/>sound, combinational tones appear, but in this case we are not<br/>talking about beatings, but of &quot;real&quot; combinational sounds, that you<br/>can see in your Fourier spectra, regardless it is made by a spectrum<br/>analyzer or by your brain)</p><p>So, I repute the distinction between pressure (instantaneous)<br/>stimulus and loudness (amplitude of pressure wave) crucial for a<br/>better understanding.

Note: in my previous estimation I<br/>disregarded the fact that amplitude is proportional to the modulus<br/>of cos(delta t/2) etc. and not to just cos(delta t/2). Then when you<br/>sum up the two amplitudes you have to sum up the moduli.</p><p>In conclusion, the overall amplitude modulation has the shape of a 1<br/>+ 2|cos(delta t/2)| + 2|sin(delta t/2)|, therefore has frequency 2<br/>delta (one factor 2 comes from the modulus, another factor 2 comes<br/>from the sum of sine and cosine) and has spans from amplitude 3 to<br/>amplitude 1+2Sqrt(2) that is about 3.828. This analysis is<br/>straightforward only if delta is small enough, otherwise amplitudes<br/>behave differently. I have checked all this with Mathematica, that<br/>could also play the waveforms, in the case of the just major triad<br/>with tonic at 220 Hz and with a detuning of the middle tone of 1 Hz.<br/>I could then check that what I hear is actually what I say in this<br/>case. I have also made other tests, all confirming that everything<br/>should be ok.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m interested to see this. Previously the existence of beating was<br/>&gt; written off as a failure of the basilar membrane to discern between<br/>&gt; fine pitch differences, but I&apos;ve long suspected there&apos;s more to it<br/>&gt; than that. By that logic, if the basilar membrane had infinitely<br/>fine<br/>&gt; frequency resolution, then we&apos;d never hear any changes in the sound<br/>&gt; over time - we&apos;d perceive all of sound as one static, unchanging<br/>sound<br/>&gt; throughout our lifetime! I suspect there is some neurological<br/>&gt; mechanism to explain why the brain sometimes &quot;flips&quot; its<br/>perspective<br/>&gt; on the incoming signal to hear it as a modulation envelope over a<br/>tone<br/>&gt; vs. different tones - something beyond critical band effects.</p><p>Your analysis is interesting. I think that one should distinguish<br/>between the real behaviour of sound, and what is created into the<br/>ear or the brain. As a physicist I would first like to understand<br/>what is already in the sound, and as my personal interest, I would<br/>study in particular the issue of consonance/dissonance.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In the case of Chris&apos; samples made in equal temperament, the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference of fifth and third from the just intonation ones<br/>accounts<br/>&gt; &gt; for the heard low-frequency beat of the major triad. Perhaps, as<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; my starting guess already discussed with Carl, in the case that<br/>&gt; &gt; beatings become too fast and may be heard as a &quot;strange&quot; type of<br/>&gt; &gt; tone, this could also account for the slight dissonance effect<br/>of the<br/>&gt; &gt; minor triad; this explanation is not yet satisfying to me and I<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; like to explore this point further.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I made this point earlier as well. If you take 5/4 and you widen it<br/>&gt; slowly, you&apos;ll hear the beating start. Keep widening it until you<br/>get<br/>&gt; to 9/7. At this point the 5/4 will sound uncomfortably sharp, and<br/>the<br/>&gt; beating will have gotten too fast to hear, as you put it... But if<br/>you<br/>&gt; stay on 9/7 for a second, you might experience a sudden perception<br/>&gt; shift whereas you suddenly realize that the &quot;beating&quot; is in a<br/>regular<br/>&gt; pattern, and then you&apos;ll suddenly become aware of the different<br/>&gt; fundamental and hear it as 9/7.</p><p>This is for sure a matter of interpretation of our brain<br/>(&quot;perception shift&quot;). To understand better this, I think it is<br/>necessary to know very well how the sound is composed and &quot;why&quot; it<br/>is so (in the sense of what are the factors influencing etc) I will<br/>try what you propose, although I suspect the result depends on<br/>how &quot;good&quot; and trained is one&apos;s ear...</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, I would like to go on. Of course, beatings cannot fully<br/>&gt; &gt; account for consonance/dissonance, but may as well be part of<br/>it. As<br/>&gt; &gt; for the example suggested by Carl, I have tested by generating<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; waveforms by Mathemathica and playing them, so it is not<br/>reliable and<br/>&gt; &gt; we are waiting for Chris&apos; new sample.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What sample are you guys waiting for? 7 and 11 limit major vs minor<br/>&gt; chords?

Say &quot;ahhhhh... ahhhhh... ahhhhh... ahhhhh...&quot; so that<br/>the pitch stays the same. Try to make the amplitude change in as<br/>sinusoidal a pattern as possible. The &quot;aaahhhhhh&quot; signal is being<br/>modulated by the sinusoidal &quot;envelope&quot; of your choosing. If you were<br/>to perform a fourier analysis of this, and if your &quot;aaahhhhh&quot; was a<br/>perfect sine wave, you would see three frequencies: the center<br/>frequency, the center frequency - the frequency of the amplitude<br/>modulation, and the center frequency + the frequency of the amplitude<br/>modulation. So if you sing at A 440 and the volume goes up and down in<br/>a sinusoidal pattern with a complete repetition every second, you&apos;ll<br/>see 439 Hz, 440 Hz, and 441 Hz.</p><p>This isn&apos;t strictly &quot;ring modulation&quot; since the modulator in this case<br/>is &quot;unipolar&quot; (the volume is going from 1 to 0, not from 1 to -1) and<br/>so the 440 Hz will still be in there as well. If you want to devise a<br/>clever way to reverse the phase every other time, then that would be<br/>strictly &quot;ring modulation&quot;. This is more like ring modulation with the<br/>original signal added back in.</p><p>Regardless, the point I&apos;m making is something about how Fourier<br/>analysis works. It takes the whole signal and tells you how to rebuild<br/>that signal up from scratch by taking sine waves of different<br/>&quot;frequencies&quot; that stretch from the beginning of time to an infinite<br/>distance away from here. Envelope changes are dealt with by figuring<br/>out what infinite series of sine wave will add up to somehow yield the<br/>waveform anyway. It isn&apos;t REALLY doing everything that the &quot;ear&quot; is<br/>doing when it converts a waveform in the air. A frequency present in a<br/>Fourier transform doesn&apos;t necessarily translate into a pitch we hear,<br/>and for more reasons than just human threshold of hearing limits and<br/>such.</p><p>This is sort of a simplification, and for the DFT/FFT, the sine waves<br/>don&apos;t stretch back from -Infinity to Infinity, but rather from the<br/>beginning of the signal we&apos;re analyzing to the end. You can take the<br/>DFT of a whole song and get a ton of frequencies present. You don&apos;t<br/>hear all of those frequencies as static &quot;pitches&quot;, do you? You didn&apos;t<br/>suddenly hear three pitches jump into existence when you went<br/>&quot;aaaaahhhh.....aaaaahhhh...&quot;, right?

Say &quot;ahhhhh... ahhhhh... ahhhhh... ahhhhh...&quot; so that<br/>the pitch stays the same. Try to make the amplitude change in as<br/>sinusoidal a pattern as possible. The &quot;aaahhhhhh&quot; signal is being<br/>modulated by the sinusoidal &quot;envelope&quot; of your choosing. If you were<br/>to perform a fourier analysis of this, and if your &quot;aaahhhhh&quot; was a<br/>perfect sine wave, you would see three frequencies: the center<br/>frequency, the center frequency - the frequency of the amplitude<br/>modulation, and the center frequency + the frequency of the amplitude<br/>modulation. So if you sing at A 440 and the volume goes up and down in<br/>a sinusoidal pattern with a complete repetition every second, you&apos;ll<br/>see 439 Hz, 440 Hz, and 441 Hz.</p><p>This isn&apos;t strictly &quot;ring modulation&quot; since the modulator in this case<br/>is &quot;unipolar&quot; (the volume is going from 1 to 0, not from 1 to -1) and<br/>so the 440 Hz will still be in there as well. If you want to devise a<br/>clever way to reverse the phase every other time, then that would be<br/>strictly &quot;ring modulation&quot;. This is more like ring modulation with the<br/>original signal added back in.</p><p>Regardless, the point I&apos;m making is something about how Fourier<br/>analysis works. It takes the whole signal and tells you how to rebuild<br/>that signal up from scratch by taking sine waves of different<br/>&quot;frequencies&quot; that stretch from the beginning of time to an infinite<br/>distance away from here. Envelope changes are dealt with by figuring<br/>out what infinite series of sine wave will add up to somehow yield the<br/>waveform anyway. It isn&apos;t REALLY doing everything that the &quot;ear&quot; is<br/>doing when it converts a waveform in the air. A frequency present in a<br/>Fourier transform doesn&apos;t necessarily translate into a pitch we hear,<br/>and for more reasons than just human threshold of hearing limits and<br/>such.</p><p>This is sort of a simplification, and for the DFT/FFT, the sine waves<br/>don&apos;t stretch back from -Infinity to Infinity, but rather from the<br/>beginning of the signal we&apos;re analyzing to the end.

No matter what your tone generation<br/>mechanism is, from a Fourier analysis standpoint, the resultant signal<br/>from both of those methods is going to be identical both in terms of<br/>the time-domain waveform and the FFT spectrum.

If you had a ring modulator - a true sin * cos operation, you<br/>would see only difference and sum frequency.</p><p>Cosine product could be easily performed by digital signal<br/>processing too. Something similar is what one can do by matlab,<br/>mathematica etc. I have tried such products with Mathematica and it<br/>worked fine.

Especially, it seems that FFT is<br/>calculated on a rather long time window so that when you change a tone,<br/>you see the old one slowly disappearing from the spectrum while you see<br/>the newer one slowly appearing. Sometimes the tones are changed too<br/>quickly, so that the &quot;steady state&quot; spectrum does never show up.</p><p>Anyway, it would be nice to see the waveform on a longer timescale,<br/>e.g. 1 or 2 seconds, so that if you have slow beatings (e.g. 1 Hz or<br/>even 5 Hz) you can see the envelope of the waveform.</p><p>With just intonation there should be no &quot;slow&quot; envelope when you play<br/>the major triad with pure tones. There should be some &quot;fast&quot; beating<br/>(or what I call fast beating), that is an amplitude envelope at a<br/>frequency equal to the difference frequency of the single dyads, that<br/>on the other hand is not much different from the frequency of the tones<br/>themselves (e.g. 55 Hz (and 110 Hz) for a triad made up by 220 Hz A,<br/>275 Hz C# and 330 Hz E), and for sure that the ear cannot follow--- or<br/>let&apos;say it better: when the ear can follow the amplitude beating, it is<br/>not able to hear distinct tones (we hear one mean tone with amplitude<br/>envelope), while when the ear cannot follow the amplitude beating<br/>anymore (because it becomes too fast), then it becomes able to &quot;split&quot;<br/>the distinct tones of the dyad or chord.</p><p>What is intriguing me is: is there a physical mechanism (I am not<br/>looking for psychoacoustic explanations, because I have no scientific<br/>basis to understand those) lying below this phenomenon of passage from<br/>one mean tone with amplitude beating to split tones with no beating -<br/>and all the intermediate situations of course, that seemingly cause the<br/>sensation of dissonance - occurs in the ear? I mean, are there physical<br/>reasons for that, or it is completely or mainly due to psychoacoustics?</p><p>After the interesting discussion going on here on the tuning list, the<br/>focus of my curiosity definitely moves to the ear&apos;s (physical) working<br/>principle. That is: why a detector (ear) is capable to record slow<br/>amplitude variations, to hear a range of acoustic frequencies fron 20<br/>Hz to 20kHz or so, but not to hear an amplitude variation faster than<br/>20-30 Hz (or, better, is capable to hear it but it renders such beating<br/>as the presence of two tones)? There must be something tricky in this,<br/>since at the threshold between such two behaviors an &quot;annoying&quot;<br/>sensation comes out (dissonance)... The explanation could be that<br/>everything is due to a psychoacoustical effect, of course, but I would<br/>love to rule out possible purely-physical effects before giving the<br/>easier explanation that &quot;brain is doing everything&quot;!</p><p>Max</p></div><h3><a id=80035 href="#80035">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2009 9:37:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Max,</p><p>I agree about the flaws of the video.

Adding two<br/>sine waves together will not generate another sine wave of a different<br/>frequency. The beat frequency never -becomes- audible - when do you<br/>ever hear a third note pop out when you add two together? And even<br/>more misleading is the fact that what they referred to as the &quot;beat<br/>frequency&quot; there is really twice what it REALLY is, as every other<br/>&quot;beat&quot; is phase inverted. 439 Hz and 441 Hz is equal to a 440 Hz sine<br/>wave modified sinusoidally by 1 Hz. However, we don&apos;t hear any<br/>difference between the two &quot;humps&quot; in the beating, even though every<br/>other one is phase inverted, and so it is often said that the beat<br/>frequency here is 2 Hz.</p><p>Here, let&apos;s put it this way. If you add 440 Hz and 410 Hz together,<br/>does a low bass 30 Hz note suddenly appear? No. Does a high 850 Hz<br/>combination appear? No way. And even if you do faintly perceive some<br/>of these tones due to some nonlinear effect of the ear, the speaker,<br/>the brain, or anything, that certainly doesn&apos;t mean that it is present<br/>in the original signal from a Fourier Analysis standpoint. In fact, by<br/>DEFINITION, 440 Hz and 410 Hz waves added together will yield only 440<br/>Hz and 410 Hz in the resulting spectrum when a Fourier Transform is<br/>done on it. That&apos;s the whole point of Fourier Analysis - to tell you<br/>what sine waves to add together to give you back the original signal.<br/>The notion that the combination tone is physically created as a sine<br/>wave is equivalent to saying that 440 Hz + 410 Hz = 440 Hz + 410 Hz +<br/>30 Hz, which is simply a false statement.</p><p>Now, I&apos;m a bit rusty on the exact picture of the inner ear, but this<br/>should give you an idea of the general picture of what causes beating:</p><p>The usual stated cause for beating when two sinusoids are close in<br/>frequency is due somewhat to the physics of the ear. In the cochlea,<br/>along the basilar membrane, lie tons of little hairs (or nerve fibers,<br/>as I&apos;ve sometimes heard them cited to be) that resonate at different<br/>frequencies. They are arranged logarithmically in order from high to<br/>low frequencies (or is it low to high?), and when those hairs are<br/>stimulated, they trigger nerve endings under the hears, and resultant<br/>signal is sent straight through the nervous system to the brain, where<br/>more stuff happens.</p><p>Now each of these hairs doesn&apos;t resonate at only one frequency: rather<br/>a general &quot;range&quot; of frequencies centered around one frequency,<br/>something like a bandpass filter. The filters of the different hairs<br/>overlap in such a way that the entire hearing spectrum is covered.<br/>When you put in 440 Hz and 6000 Hz, the 440 Hz tone is ideally<br/>captured by one of the bandpass filters and the 6000 Hz tone is<br/>captured by another one, and the two are sent along separate pathways<br/>to the brain with no constructive or destructive interference.</p><p>When you put in 440 Hz and 441 Hz, both of them are snatched up by the<br/>same bandpass filter and the combined signal is sent to the brain, so<br/>constructive and destructive interference actually takes place, and we<br/>hear beating. These bandpass filters are commonly referred to as<br/>&quot;critical bands&quot; in literature about this stuff. The theory goes that<br/>the neural &quot;channels&quot; that critical band dumps information to can only<br/>operate on one tone at a time, and so when 440 Hz and 441 Hz is sent,<br/>you only do hear one tone. If you listen carefully, it will sound like<br/>440.5 Hz, but as the tones are widened, it starts to sound<br/>increasingly like the pitch is &quot;wobbling&quot; a bit, and eventually it<br/>widens into two tones.</p><p>Now, even this picture is incomplete, as it assumes a few things about<br/>how the brain makes a time-frequency map of a signal that are a bit<br/>arbitrary. A certain amount of an incoming signal needs to be looked<br/>at in RETROSPECT to get any kind of idea about what &quot;frequencies&quot; are<br/>present in the signal. There needs to be a &quot;window&quot; of time in which<br/>we look at the signal to get an idea about its frequency content.<br/>There is no reason that this time window needs to be the same for all<br/>frequencies or that it has to be a static constant that doesn&apos;t<br/>change. The length of this window will also radically alter the<br/>frequency content of the signal.</p><p>I suspect there is some kind of &quot;perspective shift&quot; that occurs in the<br/>brain whereby different frequencies added together end up becoming<br/>other frequencies being modulated by some kind of envelope. This is<br/>something distinct from the critical band effects I mentioned above -<br/>I&apos;m not sure if this corresponds to a &quot;changing&quot; of the window size or<br/>what&apos;s going on there. Max&apos;s recent posts validate my suspicions on<br/>this.</p><p>Nonetheless: wherever this new train of thought about beating and<br/>other band effects ends up leading, it has NOTHING to do with anything<br/>labeled &quot;difference tones&quot;. Difference tones and combination tones are<br/>terms that refer to some kind of intermodulation distortion, like when<br/>you play two notes simultaneously on a distorted guitar and it sounds<br/>&quot;noisy&quot;. And constructive and destructive interference alone is only<br/>half of the story, since the signal is SPLIT UP within the inner ear<br/>into separate channels. Within -one- critical band, there can be<br/>constructive and destructive interference that could partially account<br/>for beating, even if the question of how the brain manages to perceive<br/>changing frequency content at all is ignored.</p><p>That&apos;s the full picture, in all of its complicated glory. If you are<br/>interested in this stuff, and you want to understand more about<br/>Fourier Analysis in general, then you should probably first learn<br/>about the mathematical operation of convolution and the &quot;convolution<br/>theorem&quot; as it applies to Fourier Analysis. Despite the scary name,<br/>they aren&apos;t that complicated if explained the right way. You should<br/>also understand the distinction between linear and non-linear systems<br/>(which also isn&apos;t that complicated), as these concepts are hard to<br/>explain without referring to them with that terminology. You should<br/>also learn about some of the basic properties of linear,<br/>time-invariant systems. Fourier analysis is an extremely deep subject<br/>with a lot of twists and turns, and it&apos;s essential to be able to<br/>navigate it to discuss the causes of more complicated, emergent<br/>phenomena such as beating.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=80062 href="#80062">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2009 3:16:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Both you and Carl,</p><p>Either combination tones AND beats are a physical phenomenon (and not a<br/>perception phenomenon) OR it is not a physical phenomenon and lies in the<br/>realm of perception.</p><p>I guess I could go back and dredge through all the posts and show you where<br/>people were saying things like &quot;beating was a real physical phenomenon but<br/>will never show in Fourier analysis&quot; and beating and combination tones were<br/>different phenomena.

Adding two<br/>&gt; sine waves together will not generate another sine wave of a different<br/>&gt; frequency. The beat frequency never -becomes- audible - when do you<br/>&gt; ever hear a third note pop out when you add two together? And even<br/>&gt; more misleading is the fact that what they referred to as the &quot;beat<br/>&gt; frequency&quot; there is really twice what it REALLY is, as every other<br/>&gt; &quot;beat&quot; is phase inverted. 439 Hz and 441 Hz is equal to a 440 Hz sine<br/>&gt; wave modified sinusoidally by 1 Hz. However, we don&apos;t hear any<br/>&gt; difference between the two &quot;humps&quot; in the beating, even though every<br/>&gt; other one is phase inverted, and so it is often said that the beat<br/>&gt; frequency here is 2 Hz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, let&apos;s put it this way. If you add 440 Hz and 410 Hz together,<br/>&gt; does a low bass 30 Hz note suddenly appear? No. Does a high 850 Hz<br/>&gt; combination appear? No way. And even if you do faintly perceive some<br/>&gt; of these tones due to some nonlinear effect of the ear, the speaker,<br/>&gt; the brain, or anything, that certainly doesn&apos;t mean that it is present<br/>&gt; in the original signal from a Fourier Analysis standpoint. In fact, by<br/>&gt; DEFINITION, 440 Hz and 410 Hz waves added together will yield only 440<br/>&gt; Hz and 410 Hz in the resulting spectrum when a Fourier Transform is<br/>&gt; done on it. That&apos;s the whole point of Fourier Analysis - to tell you<br/>&gt; what sine waves to add together to give you back the original signal.<br/>&gt; The notion that the combination tone is physically created as a sine<br/>&gt; wave is equivalent to saying that 440 Hz + 410 Hz = 440 Hz + 410 Hz +<br/>&gt; 30 Hz, which is simply a false statement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, I&apos;m a bit rusty on the exact picture of the inner ear, but this<br/>&gt; should give you an idea of the general picture of what causes beating:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The usual stated cause for beating when two sinusoids are close in<br/>&gt; frequency is due somewhat to the physics of the ear. In the cochlea,<br/>&gt; along the basilar membrane, lie tons of little hairs (or nerve fibers,<br/>&gt; as I&apos;ve sometimes heard them cited to be) that resonate at different<br/>&gt; frequencies. They are arranged logarithmically in order from high to<br/>&gt; low frequencies (or is it low to high?), and when those hairs are<br/>&gt; stimulated, they trigger nerve endings under the hears, and resultant<br/>&gt; signal is sent straight through the nervous system to the brain, where<br/>&gt; more stuff happens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now each of these hairs doesn&apos;t resonate at only one frequency: rather<br/>&gt; a general &quot;range&quot; of frequencies centered around one frequency,<br/>&gt; something like a bandpass filter. The filters of the different hairs<br/>&gt; overlap in such a way that the entire hearing spectrum is covered.<br/>&gt; When you put in 440 Hz and 6000 Hz, the 440 Hz tone is ideally<br/>&gt; captured by one of the bandpass filters and the 6000 Hz tone is<br/>&gt; captured by another one, and the two are sent along separate pathways<br/>&gt; to the brain with no constructive or destructive interference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you put in 440 Hz and 441 Hz, both of them are snatched up by the<br/>&gt; same bandpass filter and the combined signal is sent to the brain, so<br/>&gt; constructive and destructive interference actually takes place, and we<br/>&gt; hear beating. These bandpass filters are commonly referred to as<br/>&gt; &quot;critical bands&quot; in literature about this stuff. The theory goes that<br/>&gt; the neural &quot;channels&quot; that critical band dumps information to can only<br/>&gt; operate on one tone at a time, and so when 440 Hz and 441 Hz is sent,<br/>&gt; you only do hear one tone. If you listen carefully, it will sound like<br/>&gt; 440.5 Hz, but as the tones are widened, it starts to sound<br/>&gt; increasingly like the pitch is &quot;wobbling&quot; a bit, and eventually it<br/>&gt; widens into two tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, even this picture is incomplete, as it assumes a few things about<br/>&gt; how the brain makes a time-frequency map of a signal that are a bit<br/>&gt; arbitrary. A certain amount of an incoming signal needs to be looked<br/>&gt; at in RETROSPECT to get any kind of idea about what &quot;frequencies&quot; are<br/>&gt; present in the signal. There needs to be a &quot;window&quot; of time in which<br/>&gt; we look at the signal to get an idea about its frequency content.<br/>&gt; There is no reason that this time window needs to be the same for all<br/>&gt; frequencies or that it has to be a static constant that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; change. The length of this window will also radically alter the<br/>&gt; frequency content of the signal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect there is some kind of &quot;perspective shift&quot; that occurs in the<br/>&gt; brain whereby different frequencies added together end up becoming<br/>&gt; other frequencies being modulated by some kind of envelope. This is<br/>&gt; something distinct from the critical band effects I mentioned above -<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if this corresponds to a &quot;changing&quot; of the window size or<br/>&gt; what&apos;s going on there. Max&apos;s recent posts validate my suspicions on<br/>&gt; this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nonetheless: wherever this new train of thought about beating and<br/>&gt; other band effects ends up leading, it has NOTHING to do with anything<br/>&gt; labeled &quot;difference tones&quot;. Difference tones and combination tones are<br/>&gt; terms that refer to some kind of intermodulation distortion, like when<br/>&gt; you play two notes simultaneously on a distorted guitar and it sounds<br/>&gt; &quot;noisy&quot;. And constructive and destructive interference alone is only<br/>&gt; half of the story, since the signal is SPLIT UP within the inner ear<br/>&gt; into separate channels. Within -one- critical band, there can be<br/>&gt; constructive and destructive interference that could partially account<br/>&gt; for beating, even if the question of how the brain manages to perceive<br/>&gt; changing frequency content at all is ignored.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the full picture, in all of its complicated glory. If you are<br/>&gt; interested in this stuff, and you want to understand more about<br/>&gt; Fourier Analysis in general, then you should probably first learn<br/>&gt; about the mathematical operation of convolution and the &quot;convolution<br/>&gt; theorem&quot; as it applies to Fourier Analysis. Despite the scary name,<br/>&gt; they aren&apos;t that complicated if explained the right way. You should<br/>&gt; also understand the distinction between linear and non-linear systems<br/>&gt; (which also isn&apos;t that complicated), as these concepts are hard to<br/>&gt; explain without referring to them with that terminology. You should<br/>&gt; also learn about some of the basic properties of linear,<br/>&gt; time-invariant systems. Fourier analysis is an extremely deep subject<br/>&gt; with a lot of twists and turns, and it&apos;s essential to be able to<br/>&gt; navigate it to discuss the causes of more complicated, emergent<br/>&gt; phenomena such as beating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80065 href="#80065">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2009 7:14:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Actually I hear about 4 beats per second in the utonal 4:5:6:7:9, for<br/>some reason.

And I&apos;ve copied a recent description<br/>of mine below.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt;When presented with an auditory stimulus, the brain will attempt<br/>&gt;to assign it a pitch.  It does this by extracting harmonically-<br/>&gt;related signals in the spectrum analysis of the stimulus.  The<br/>&gt;stimulus need not be periodic for this to work, but even if it<br/>&gt;is, the brain is only so good at:<br/>&gt; 1. performing spectrum analysis -- failure here results in<br/>&gt;roughness<br/>&gt; 2. detecting periodicity -- failure here results in high<br/>&gt;harmonic entropy<br/>&gt;For clean stimuli with periodicities in the range the brain is<br/>&gt;good at detecting (such as 5-limit major triads), the extracted<br/>&gt;pitch will fairly unambiguous (though it will sometimes get<br/>&gt;confused by octaves).  For other kinds of stimuli, the stochastic<br/>&gt;nature of processes in the brain becomes evident -- populations<br/>&gt;of thousands or millions or tens of millions of neurons are used<br/>&gt;to accomplish signal-processing tasks.  There will be several<br/>&gt;pitches competing for the &apos;answer&apos;, and harmonic entropy can be<br/>&gt;used to model this uncertainty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In the case of 10:12:15, the probability distribution for the<br/>&gt;fundamental will be mostly covered by the pitches 5, 8, and 10.<br/>&gt;If the tones of the chord are complex tones, the timbre will<br/>&gt;influence the relative likelihoods of 5, 8, and 10 being heard<br/>&gt;as the fundamental.  In the case that 8 is heard, the brain is<br/>&gt;interpreting 10:12:15 literally, as a segment of harmonics<br/>&gt;relatively high in the series.  If 10 or 5 are heard, the brain<br/>&gt;is saying it considers 10:15 = 3:2, and is dismissing the 12 as<br/>&gt;an artifact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In the case of 16:19:24, the same tradeoff exists, but now the<br/>&gt;complete series-segment interpretation is even less likely<br/>&gt;because it is even higher in the series.  However in this case,<br/>&gt;both interpretations lead to the same fundamental, namely 8 or 16<br/>&gt;(or 4 if the chord is registered in the soprano).  Therefore<br/>&gt;entropy associated with the probability distribution for the<br/>&gt;fundamental tends to be as lower or lower than that for 10:12:15,<br/>&gt;with the result that 16:19:24 is slighly more stable, more<br/>&gt;&quot;major&quot;, more &quot;happy&quot; if you will, than 10:12:15.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Having used 6:7:9 chords on several instruments over the years,<br/>&gt;including several pianos, my own impression is that it is indeed<br/>&gt;more consonant, in a sense, than either 10:12:15 or 16:19:24.<br/>&gt;However, there are two things against it:<br/>&gt; 1. 7/6 is getting close to the critical band, and even in the<br/>&gt;middle of the piano, we hear some beating between its partials.<br/>&gt;As mentioned before, this beating is nicely synchronous, but it<br/>&gt;lends the interval to a somewhat &apos;tense&apos; feeling.  This can be a<br/>&gt;good thing for minor chords however. :)<br/>&gt; 2. The chord is, in fact, low enough in the harmonic series that<br/>&gt;the implied fundamental is likely to be 4 (or 2 or 1 depending on<br/>&gt;the voicing).  Compare my analysis of 10:12:15, where almost<br/>&gt;always 10 or 5 will be heard as the root, with the 12 being<br/>&gt;dismissed by the hearing system as unrecoverable (unless you<br/>&gt;listen to 15-chords all the time, as Mike seems to do, when you<br/>&gt;may hear 4 or 8 for the root. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In summary, 6:7:9 is an excellent minor chord and can be used<br/>&gt;even in performances of existing classical music.  But overall I<br/>&gt;think either 10:12:15 or 16:19:24 are to be preferred, because of<br/>&gt;their greater tendency to evoke a fundamental that is the same as<br/>&gt;the root (lowest tone or octave extension of the lowest tone) of<br/>&gt;the chord.</p></div><h3><a id=80071 href="#80071">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2009 9:57:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder of power can be a measure of consonance?</p><p>So I can make things more consonant by turning up the volume?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=80073 href="#80073">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>1/19/2009 10:17:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I believe I gave examples that clarified my meaning.

Difference tones are physical phenomena<br/>alright -- they can be recorded coming out of the ears using<br/>a microphone!  They are, by definition, musical tones created<br/>in the ear.  Beating is AM.  As with difference tones, the<br/>frequency of beating is f1-f2, but the thing at that frequency<br/>in the case of beating is not a_tone_, but rather a variation<br/>in the volume of a tone.  Both can occur at the same time.<br/>You could hear a wah-wah-wah at f1-f2 Hz, and a pitch at<br/>f1-f2 Hz.  Or you could turn down the volume until the difference<br/>tone became inaudible and you&apos;d still hear the beating.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=80075 href="#80075">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2009 11:15:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, chrisvaisvil@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First order of business is to seperate the physics from the<br/>&gt; biological.

They<br/>have nothing to do with beating. If you play 440 Hz and 441 Hz<br/>together, you&apos;ll hear 440.5 Hz with a perceived 1 Hz beating (but<br/>really 0.5 Hz). If you play the two together through some hypothetical<br/>distortion unit that doesn&apos;t add harmonics, then you&apos;ll still hear<br/>440.5 Hz with a perceived 1 Hz beating.

If you tak&eacute; a two seconds long sine wave of 440.5Hz and multiply it with a two seconds long cosine wave of 0.5Hz, the second half of the resulting sound will be identical to the first one because in both cases the second half of the sound is the exact 180-degree phase shift of the first half, which means that you have &quot;plus times plus&quot; in the first half of the result and &quot;minus times minus&quot; in the second half -- i.e. both are the same. What this means is that if you mix a 440Hz sine wave with a 441Hz sine wave, then the period of repetition is actually 1 second, not 2 seconds.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=80091 href="#80091">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>1/20/2009 5:15:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Max,</p><p>I live in the usa midwest.

All else<br/>being equal, the &apos;error&apos; of an octave fudge is 1/2, of a<br/>tritave fudge 2/3, etc.  Those converge quickly to 1.<br/>In the brain it may even be slightly worse, if neurons<br/>&quot;overfitted&quot; to the trend.</p><p>That said, in this particular example I listed probable<br/>VFs by hunch not by calculation.  One needs to compute<br/>&quot;van Eck widths&quot; in triadspace to do it right.  There&apos;s<br/>no consensus on how to do that, but we&apos;ve looked at the<br/>voronoi cells of rational triads in triadspace and it<br/>looks like their areas approximate the good ol&apos; a*b*c<br/>rule.  But then one still needs a way to include dyadic<br/>interpretations like &apos;10:12:15 = 2:3 + crap&apos; in the mix,<br/>and again there&apos;s no consensus how that should be done.<br/>For instance</p><p>2:3 -&gt; 1/sqrt(6) ~ 0.41<br/>10:12:15 -&gt; 1/cubert(1800) ~ 0.08<br/>4:5:6:15 ................. ~ 0.15</p><p>and then use a greedy algorithm that scores against the<br/>mismatch of the interpretation and the spectrum</p><p>.41 * 2/3 = 0.27  //2:3<br/>.08 * 3/3 = 0.08  //10:12:15<br/>.15 * 3/4 = 0.12  //4:5:6:15</p><p>So 2:3 goes first, and that leaves 12 sitting there as part<br/>of the timbre and the VF should be 5.  Or something like that.<br/>Honestly, I&apos;m late for work and just making this up.<br/>Somebody really should code up a working version.</p><p>&gt; OK, with 4:5:6(:7:9...) we are quite happy saying that 4 is the<br/>&gt; &apos;fundamental&apos;, but that is a rather special case, where it is<br/>&gt; also the lowest out of three or more contiguous and nicely<br/>&gt; spaced harmonics.  What about 3:4:5(:6...)? Logically, 3 ought<br/>&gt; to be able to be the fundamental here, unless the powers of<br/>&gt; 2 have some really special psychoacoustic property.</p><p>With sines, 3:4:5... definitely evokes 1, so long as the tones<br/>begin at the same instant (if you play them from a keyboard,<br/>scene analysis stuff may start to kick in, but on the telephone<br/>for example we have no trouble hearing 1 for male voices even<br/>though it is entirely missing from the signal).</p><p>&gt;&gt; two things against it (6:7:9) //<br/>&gt;&gt; 2. The chord is, in fact, low enough in the harmonic series that<br/>&gt;&gt; the implied fundamental is likely to be 4 (or 2 or 1 depending on<br/>&gt;&gt; the voicing). Compare my analysis of 10:12:15, where almost<br/>&gt;&gt; always 10 or 5 will be heard as the root, with the 12 being<br/>&gt;&gt; dismissed by the hearing system as unrecoverable (...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which assumes again that only a power of 2 above the periodicity<br/>&gt; pitch may possibly be a fundamental (ignoring any &apos;dismissed&apos;<br/>&gt; pitches). What in the theory tells us that 4:1 can but 3:1 can&apos;t?</p><p>See above.</p><p>&gt;&gt; tendency to evoke a fundamental that is the same as<br/>&gt;&gt; the root (lowest tone or octave extension of the lowest tone)<br/>&gt;&gt; of the chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Precisely this language &apos;octave extension&apos; - where does it come<br/>&gt; from and what does it mean psychoacoustically?</p><p>If you don&apos;t like my reliance on octaves you&apos;ll hate mainstream<br/>psychoacoustics!  Actually there are some neat auditory illusions<br/>with octaves...

This transforms the<br/>carrier sinewave with zero average into the carrier sinewave with a<br/>nonzero average. This is still not audible (say, if the carrier<br/>frequency was 400000 Hz you could not hear anything even if the<br/>amplitude of it was changing, and even if the average of the wave was<br/>changing).</p><p>Then you low-pass filter the carrier wave, so that you transform the<br/>carrier wave in a low-frequency that has the shape of the envelope of<br/>the original carrier wave. Since the average value of such signal was<br/>not zero you obtain an audible sound (a real pressure wave). If you<br/>had not rectified (= mixed) the carrier before, the low-pass filter<br/>would give you the average value of your carrier wave = 0, always,<br/>regardless of the amplitude of the carrier wave.</p><p>The acoustic analogy of this is the following. If you have 400000 Hz<br/>and 400100 Hz acoustic wave and they beat (= this time not mixed:<br/>beat means just added up) you have an amplitude envelope at 100 Hz.<br/>The average value of pressure of this is always zero. If the ear is<br/>not sensitive to 400000 Hz AND the average pressure value at 100 Hz<br/>is zero, the ear will not react to 100 Hz either. So one should hear<br/>nothing.</p><p>If a nonlinear effect (mixing, intermodulation... same meaning) is<br/>present somewhere (speakers, ear) a net pressure wave at the<br/>difference frequency is created, the ear can actually hear a<br/>difference TONE (and also a sum tone in this case). It is convenient<br/>to call a tone a real-time pressure change, that the ear can respond<br/>to. But if no such mixing (in the sense of product, not just sum!) is<br/>present, then I doubt the ear can be sensitive to amplitude changes<br/>of a zero-average pressure wave at high frequency. Like for the<br/>radio, you can&apos;t hear the carrier wave (even if you admit that you<br/>have a speaker that makes the air vibrate at the carrier frequency,<br/>of course) if you don&apos;t 1) rectify (so create a carrier with nonzero<br/>average level) AND low-pass filter (to transform the nonzero average<br/>of a fast wave into a nonzero LEVEL pressure wave).</p><p>Even if we admit that the ear could act as a low-pass filter (that is<br/>very natural behaviour, and can be regarded as a completely linear<br/>process) it would low-pass a zero-average signal, therefore the<br/>result would be zero pressure always. The &quot;rectification&quot; process is<br/>missing (rectification is a nonlinear process though). It is the only<br/>way that you can get a nonzero average out of a zero-average periodic<br/>function like cosine: if you square the cosine, for instance, you<br/>obtain something like (1 + cos (2f))/2, when you average out the fast<br/>cosine the term 1/2 remains unaffected, that is proportional to<br/>amplitude and therefore carries the information on the envelope<br/>function (amplitude modulation in this case).</p><p>Terminology is important. When people on this list says &quot;mix&quot; it<br/>usually refers to &quot;adding up&quot; but sometimes refers to &quot;multiply&quot;. The<br/>effect of the two operations is completely different. So confusion is<br/>possible in trying to explain concepts.</p><p>Max</p><p>&gt; &gt; On Wed, Jan 21, 2009 at 1:46 PM, Marcel de Velde<br/>&lt;m.develde@...&lt;m.develde%<a href="http://40gmail.com">40gmail.com</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Max,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Difference tones and beatings are defined very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; differently therein.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not really, they just say that when 2 tones are less than about<br/>15 hertz<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; apart they seem like thesame tone and the difference tone is<br/>called<br/>&gt; &gt; beating.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But it&apos;s 2 different names for exactly thesame thing.

This transforms the<br/>&gt; carrier sinewave with zero average into the carrier sinewave with a<br/>&gt; nonzero average. This is still not audible (say, if the carrier<br/>&gt; frequency was 400000 Hz you could not hear anything even if the<br/>&gt; amplitude of it was changing, and even if the average of the wave was<br/>&gt; changing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then you low-pass filter the carrier wave, so that you transform the<br/>&gt; carrier wave in a low-frequency that has the shape of the envelope of<br/>&gt; the original carrier wave. Since the average value of such signal was<br/>&gt; not zero you obtain an audible sound (a real pressure wave). If you<br/>&gt; had not rectified (= mixed) the carrier before, the low-pass filter<br/>&gt; would give you the average value of your carrier wave = 0, always,<br/>&gt; regardless of the amplitude of the carrier wave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The acoustic analogy of this is the following. If you have 400000 Hz<br/>&gt; and 400100 Hz acoustic wave and they beat (= this time not mixed:<br/>&gt; beat means just added up) you have an amplitude envelope at 100 Hz.<br/>&gt; The average value of pressure of this is always zero. If the ear is<br/>&gt; not sensitive to 400000 Hz AND the average pressure value at 100 Hz<br/>&gt; is zero, the ear will not react to 100 Hz either. So one should hear<br/>&gt; nothing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a nonlinear effect (mixing, intermodulation... same meaning) is<br/>&gt; present somewhere (speakers, ear) a net pressure wave at the<br/>&gt; difference frequency is created, the ear can actually hear a<br/>&gt; difference TONE (and also a sum tone in this case). It is convenient<br/>&gt; to call a tone a real-time pressure change, that the ear can respond<br/>&gt; to. But if no such mixing (in the sense of product, not just sum!) is<br/>&gt; present, then I doubt the ear can be sensitive to amplitude changes<br/>&gt; of a zero-average pressure wave at high frequency. Like for the<br/>&gt; radio, you can&apos;t hear the carrier wave (even if you admit that you<br/>&gt; have a speaker that makes the air vibrate at the carrier frequency,<br/>&gt; of course) if you don&apos;t 1) rectify (so create a carrier with nonzero<br/>&gt; average level) AND low-pass filter (to transform the nonzero average<br/>&gt; of a fast wave into a nonzero LEVEL pressure wave).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even if we admit that the ear could act as a low-pass filter (that is<br/>&gt; very natural behaviour, and can be regarded as a completely linear<br/>&gt; process) it would low-pass a zero-average signal, therefore the<br/>&gt; result would be zero pressure always. The &quot;rectification&quot; process is<br/>&gt; missing (rectification is a nonlinear process though). It is the only<br/>&gt; way that you can get a nonzero average out of a zero-average periodic<br/>&gt; function like cosine: if you square the cosine, for instance, you<br/>&gt; obtain something like (1 + cos (2f))/2, when you average out the fast<br/>&gt; cosine the term 1/2 remains unaffected, that is proportional to<br/>&gt; amplitude and therefore carries the information on the envelope<br/>&gt; function (amplitude modulation in this case).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Terminology is important. When people on this list says &quot;mix&quot; it<br/>&gt; usually refers to &quot;adding up&quot; but sometimes refers to &quot;multiply&quot;. The<br/>&gt; effect of the two operations is completely different. So confusion is<br/>&gt; possible in trying to explain concepts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Max<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On Wed, Jan 21, 2009 at 1:46 PM, Marcel de Velde<br/>&gt; &lt;m.develde@...&lt;m.develde%<a href="http://40gmail.com">40gmail.com</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Max,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Difference tones and beatings are defined very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; differently therein.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not really, they just say that when 2 tones are less than about<br/>&gt; 15 hertz<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apart they seem like thesame tone and the difference tone is<br/>&gt; called<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; beating.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But it&apos;s 2 different names for exactly thesame thing.

As you<br/>&gt; keep widening the interval, you&apos;ll eventually finally get to the point<br/>&gt; where beating stops, and you hear two distinct notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do NOT hear a low bass tone suddenly rise up out of nowhere and<br/>&gt; sine sweep up to infinity as the two notes keep getting further apart.<br/>&gt; If that were true, then there wouldn&apos;t BE such a thing as &quot;two notes&quot;,<br/>&gt; as two notes would then always be three notes. What you MIGHT hear is<br/>&gt; some kind of &quot;virtual fundamental&quot; popping up at different points and<br/>&gt; your perspective shifting to constantly hear different fundamentals as<br/>&gt; the interval widens. It has nothing to do with intermodulation<br/>&gt; distortion at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80183 href="#80183">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2009 9:29:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,<br/>&gt; That&apos;s right: &quot;combination tones&quot; is an umbrella term that<br/>&gt; covers sum and difference tones.

Difference tones and beating are different<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomena.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In AM radio, there is mixing (= multiplication, please care of<br/>&gt;&gt; terminology) of the carrier wave by itself. This transforms the<br/>&gt;&gt; carrier sinewave with zero average into the carrier sinewave with a<br/>&gt;&gt; nonzero average. This is still not audible (say, if the carrier<br/>&gt;&gt; frequency was 400000 Hz you could not hear anything even if the<br/>&gt;&gt; amplitude of it was changing, and even if the average of the wave was<br/>&gt;&gt; changing).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Then you low-pass filter the carrier wave, so that you transform the<br/>&gt;&gt; carrier wave in a low-frequency that has the shape of the envelope of<br/>&gt;&gt; the original carrier wave. Since the average value of such signal was<br/>&gt;&gt; not zero you obtain an audible sound (a real pressure wave). If you<br/>&gt;&gt; had not rectified (= mixed) the carrier before, the low-pass filter<br/>&gt;&gt; would give you the average value of your carrier wave = 0, always,<br/>&gt;&gt; regardless of the amplitude of the carrier wave.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The acoustic analogy of this is the following. If you have 400000 Hz<br/>&gt;&gt; and 400100 Hz acoustic wave and they beat (= this time not mixed:<br/>&gt;&gt; beat means just added up) you have an amplitude envelope at 100 Hz.<br/>&gt;&gt; The average value of pressure of this is always zero. If the ear is<br/>&gt;&gt; not sensitive to 400000 Hz AND the average pressure value at 100 Hz<br/>&gt;&gt; is zero, the ear will not react to 100 Hz either. So one should hear<br/>&gt;&gt; nothing.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If a nonlinear effect (mixing, intermodulation... same meaning) is<br/>&gt;&gt; present somewhere (speakers, ear) a net pressure wave at the<br/>&gt;&gt; difference frequency is created, the ear can actually hear a<br/>&gt;&gt; difference TONE (and also a sum tone in this case). It is convenient<br/>&gt;&gt; to call a tone a real-time pressure change, that the ear can respond<br/>&gt;&gt; to. But if no such mixing (in the sense of product, not just sum!) is<br/>&gt;&gt; present, then I doubt the ear can be sensitive to amplitude changes<br/>&gt;&gt; of a zero-average pressure wave at high frequency. Like for the<br/>&gt;&gt; radio, you can&apos;t hear the carrier wave (even if you admit that you<br/>&gt;&gt; have a speaker that makes the air vibrate at the carrier frequency,<br/>&gt;&gt; of course) if you don&apos;t 1) rectify (so create a carrier with nonzero<br/>&gt;&gt; average level) AND low-pass filter (to transform the nonzero average<br/>&gt;&gt; of a fast wave into a nonzero LEVEL pressure wave).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Even if we admit that the ear could act as a low-pass filter (that is<br/>&gt;&gt; very natural behaviour, and can be regarded as a completely linear<br/>&gt;&gt; process) it would low-pass a zero-average signal, therefore the<br/>&gt;&gt; result would be zero pressure always. The &quot;rectification&quot; process is<br/>&gt;&gt; missing (rectification is a nonlinear process though). It is the only<br/>&gt;&gt; way that you can get a nonzero average out of a zero-average periodic<br/>&gt;&gt; function like cosine: if you square the cosine, for instance, you<br/>&gt;&gt; obtain something like (1 + cos (2f))/2, when you average out the fast<br/>&gt;&gt; cosine the term 1/2 remains unaffected, that is proportional to<br/>&gt;&gt; amplitude and therefore carries the information on the envelope<br/>&gt;&gt; function (amplitude modulation in this case).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Terminology is important. When people on this list says &quot;mix&quot; it<br/>&gt;&gt; usually refers to &quot;adding up&quot; but sometimes refers to &quot;multiply&quot;. The<br/>&gt;&gt; effect of the two operations is completely different. So confusion is<br/>&gt;&gt; possible in trying to explain concepts.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Max<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On Wed, Jan 21, 2009 at 1:46 PM, Marcel de Velde<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;m.develde@...&lt;m.develde%<a href="http://40gmail.com">40gmail.com</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Max,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Difference tones and beatings are defined very<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; differently therein.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not really, they just say that when 2 tones are less than about<br/>&gt;&gt; 15 hertz<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apart they seem like thesame tone and the difference tone is<br/>&gt;&gt; called<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; beating.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But it&apos;s 2 different names for exactly thesame thing.

in an undspecified way which<br/>would be thesame way a real difference tone is generated.<br/>This is the example that confused me before when i saw the spectrogram<br/>before realising this was supposed to be a recorded &quot;difference tone&quot;.</p><p>As for the other examples I have the following problems.<br/>The first one is that the files are at 0 db level.<br/>This will give distortion in many dacs (sad but true) and I&apos;m not on a great<br/>dac now.<br/>The files should have been a few db below 0db for proper testing.</p><p>The most major problem i have with accepting i&apos;m hearing real difference<br/>tones is the following.<br/>I&apos;m hearing these supposed difference tones when i&apos;m playing the soundfiles<br/>at very low volume!<br/>A clear example is the<br/><a href="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/titchdemo/g3+b3.wav">http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/titchdemo/g3+b3.wav</a> file.<br/>Sure the supposed difference tone is more audible when you play the file at<br/>louder levels, but so would a normal wave tone that&apos;s lower in volume than<br/>the 2 other sounds, and so would audio rate beating.</p><p>Infact I find these files give me no proof as to that i&apos;m hearing real<br/>pressure wave difference tones vs distortion due to 0db level vs audio rate<br/>beating.</p><p>But I do see a way to make it clear once and for all.<br/>I&apos;ve thought up the following test:</p><p>Make in csound with pure sines thesame example as g3+b3.wav , with pure 4:5<br/>ratio, and this time at total level of a few db below 0db<br/>The supposed difference tone should come to be at g1. giving ratio 1:4:5<br/>To know if this &quot;tone&quot; at g1 is really a difference tone comming from your<br/>ear or if you&apos;re hearing audio rate beating / the periodicity of the wave<br/>there is a simple test!<br/>Make the file again with an actual wave pure sine 1Hz lower or higher than<br/>g1.<br/>Try to balance the volume of this added tone to be about thesame as the<br/>supposed difference tone you hear in the file without the added tone.</p><p>Now if there is an actual pressure wave difference tone it should cause<br/>beating with the added tone 1 Hz above or below the difference tone.<br/>If you hear beating this PROVES there is an actual difference tone.<br/>Now if you hear no 1Hz beating this PROVES there is no real difference tone<br/>and makes it extremely likely that the &quot;difference tone&quot; you&apos;re hearing is<br/>actually audio rate beating / the periodicity of the waveform, as the audio<br/>rate beating will not interact with the real sine wave to produce beating.</p><p>My csound is rusty as i said before so while i&apos;m willing to make this<br/>example and several other examples of the audibility of audio rate beating<br/>i&apos;m not going to do it now as i&apos;m too bussy with other things.<br/>But if nobody else will make this example i will eventually do it.</p><p>Marcel</p><p>On Sat, Jan 24, 2009 at 9:32 AM, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...m&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;

Your &quot;difference<br/>&gt; volume tone&quot; that you keep referring to is just another way to<br/>&gt; describe the periodicity of the overall waveform. Any periodic<br/>&gt; waveform doesn&apos;t necessarily have to contain a sine wave with that<br/>&gt; period in it. And yes, as we&apos;ve discussed here, you do actually &quot;hear&quot;<br/>&gt; the fundamental frequency of that waveform... sometimes. The hairs in<br/>&gt; your ear aren&apos;t stimulated by the envelope of the sound. Otherwise,<br/>&gt; we&apos;d hear 100 Hz when 400000 and 400100 Hz are played, since that<br/>&gt; envelope would be in the audible range whether we can hear 400k or<br/>&gt; not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The hairs in the ear are only stimulated by actual sine waves. The<br/>&gt; fact that you actually hear that lowest frequency is due to a<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic effect whereby it is &quot;created&quot; by the brain. Perhaps<br/>&gt; some difference calculation is used to ultimately arrive at the<br/>&gt; fundamental. However, it seems to be more of an &quot;active&quot; process in<br/>&gt; which it uses some kind of heuristic to find the fundamental, since it<br/>&gt; can handle mistuning of overtones pretty well, and often, for a minor<br/>&gt; chord, for example the perceived fundamental will be equal to the<br/>&gt; fundamental of the fifth dyad only, as Carl has demonstrated.

Infact I find these files give me no proof as to that i&apos;m hearing real<br/>&gt; pressure wave difference tones vs distortion due to 0db level vs audio rate<br/>&gt; beating.<br/>&gt; But I do see a way to make it clear once and for all.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve thought up the following test:<br/>&gt; Make in csound with pure sines thesame example as g3+b3.wav , with pure 4:5<br/>&gt; ratio, and this time at total level of a few db below 0db<br/>&gt; The supposed difference tone should come to be at g1. giving ratio 1:4:5<br/>&gt; To know if this &quot;tone&quot; at g1 is really a difference tone comming from your<br/>&gt; ear or if you&apos;re hearing audio rate beating / the periodicity of the wave<br/>&gt; there is a simple test!<br/>&gt; Make the file again with an actual wave pure sine 1Hz lower or higher than<br/>&gt; g1.<br/>&gt; Try to balance the volume of this added tone to be about thesame as the<br/>&gt; supposed difference tone you hear in the file without the added tone.<br/>&gt; Now if there is an actual pressure wave difference tone it should cause<br/>&gt; beating with the added tone 1 Hz above or below the difference tone.<br/>&gt; If you hear beating this PROVES there is an actual difference tone.<br/>&gt; Now if you hear no 1Hz beating this PROVES there is no real difference tone<br/>&gt; and makes it extremely likely that the &quot;difference tone&quot; you&apos;re hearing is<br/>&gt; actually audio rate beating / the periodicity of the waveform, as the audio<br/>&gt; rate beating will not interact with the real sine wave to produce beating.<br/>&gt;

In other words, it can be reductionist to<br/>pull a chord out of musical context and then analyse it. Now, only<br/>periodicity of the wave seems to explain what we would traditionally<br/>call a key. Beats do not model this correctly. For a simple eg, if we<br/>play a &apos;pure&apos; E and G as 5:6, then it IS a fact that the resultant<br/>frequency will be a low C as 1. (Remember freq is defined as the<br/>number of cycles/periods per second or the inverse of period, and it<br/>is very easy to prove that C is the freq here). While we might not be<br/>able to hear this 1 directly, the brain probably recognises when we<br/>land on 8ve equivalents, C as 2, 4 and 8. This is what we call the<br/>tonic, hence tonality. The &apos;1&apos; in sub-chords of this key are not<br/>tonics but root notes. Real music often &apos;puns&apos; on the ambiguity b/w<br/>these two, turning root notes into new tonics to affect key changes etc.</p><p>If we then change key to say D, then F# and A become 5:6, placing D in<br/>the role of 1. The point to keep in mind is that only ratios between<br/>frequencies are invariant to a change of key (A/F# = G/E = 6/5).<br/>Combination tones, being based on the sum or difference b/w<br/>frequencies (the operators + and -),do not have this key-invariance.<br/>In any case, since beats and averages can only exist after freq has<br/>already been established, and freq requires ratios, then it is clear<br/>which of the two theories is the more &apos;fundamental&apos;.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80366 href="#80366">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2009 10:03:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; It is a known fact that you can &quot;hear&quot; the &quot;periodicity&quot; of the wave<br/>&gt;&gt; at audio frequencies.

In other words, it can be reductionist to<br/>&gt; pull a chord out of musical context and then analyse it. Now, only<br/>&gt; periodicity of the wave seems to explain what we would traditionally<br/>&gt; call a key. Beats do not model this correctly. For a simple eg, if we<br/>&gt; play a &apos;pure&apos; E and G as 5:6, then it IS a fact that the resultant<br/>&gt; frequency will be a low C as 1. (Remember freq is defined as the<br/>&gt; number of cycles/periods per second or the inverse of period, and it<br/>&gt; is very easy to prove that C is the freq here). While we might not be<br/>&gt; able to hear this 1 directly, the brain probably recognises when we<br/>&gt; land on 8ve equivalents, C as 2, 4 and 8. This is what we call the<br/>&gt; tonic, hence tonality. The &apos;1&apos; in sub-chords of this key are not<br/>&gt; tonics but root notes. Real music often &apos;puns&apos; on the ambiguity b/w<br/>&gt; these two, turning root notes into new tonics to affect key changes etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we then change key to say D, then F# and A become 5:6, placing D in<br/>&gt; the role of 1. The point to keep in mind is that only ratios between<br/>&gt; frequencies are invariant to a change of key (A/F# = G/E = 6/5).<br/>&gt; Combination tones, being based on the sum or difference b/w<br/>&gt; frequencies (the operators + and -),do not have this key-invariance.<br/>&gt; In any case, since beats and averages can only exist after freq has<br/>&gt; already been established, and freq requires ratios, then it is clear<br/>&gt; which of the two theories is the more &apos;fundamental&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Rick<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80376 href="#80376">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2009 7:48:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,<br/>&gt; his is where I get off the train.

Proof:<br/>Given sin(2pivt) + sin(2pift), where v and f are frequencies and v &gt;<br/>f, if v/f = a/b, where a/b is a rational number, then the period is T<br/>= b/f = a/v and the wave will oscillate at the frequency 1/T. This is<br/>because sin(2piv1(t + a/v) + sin(2piv2(t + b/f) = sin(2pivt) +<br/>sin(2pift).</p><p>Observe that the combination of these two waves now sets each up as<br/>the &quot;a&apos;th&quot; and &quot;b&apos;th&quot; harmonic of 1/T, and this is now the fundamental<br/>1. Observe also that only in the case b =1 does a sine wave correspond<br/>to 1/T as a special case. In general, the harmonic role of the notes<br/>is purely context dependent and requires no sine wave to tell us what<br/>key we&apos;re in. I suspect that this might be part of the reason why<br/>musicians can detect the tonic-key without explicitly &quot;hearing&quot; the<br/>tonic. Further, since this is now it&apos;s frequency, then it can be added<br/>to other such frequencies and the process repeated ad infinitum. In my<br/>opinion, this is a far better model of musical harmony than analysing<br/>beat frequencies after the fact. So instead of taking an isolated<br/>example and looking to explain musical harmony via beats, think of all<br/>the waves produced by a symphony orchestra. The &quot;proof&quot; is not to be<br/>found in Helmholtz but in the entire history of (western?) tonality.<br/>Music is already a science and there can be no science &quot;of&quot; music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Rick<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80384 href="#80384">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2009 8:48:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jan 30, 2009 at 10:48 AM, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; his is where I get off the train.

You&apos;re trying to connect dots, and it&apos;s all<br/>&gt; good, but there&apos;s more to the story than you&apos;ve said.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes it does have everything to do with beating.<br/>&gt; &gt; Hear for youself the difference when you play 300, 500, 700 etc Hz with<br/>&gt; pure<br/>&gt; &gt; sines and then with overtone rich sounds.<br/>&gt; &gt; The reason you hear 100 Hz beating so strongly is because the 2nd<br/>&gt; harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; of 300Hz is 600 which interacts with both 500 and 700Hz to produce 100 Hz<br/>&gt; &gt; beating, etc same story for all the other tones and all their harmonics.<br/>&gt; &gt; But thank you for giving me an example for example 1, can you give me<br/>&gt; &gt; another that doesn&apos;t create the virtual fundamental because of overtones?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It still works with sines and 600 Hz isn&apos;t present in the signal with<br/>&gt; just sines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 10:12:15 is a common example of a chord in which the phantom<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fundamental that pops out doesn&apos;t seem to be 1, but often 5.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes, for a 4:5:6 chord, 2 will pop out as the dominant<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fundamental. However, sometimes 1 pops out too. That&apos;s about all there<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; is to it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes and 5 beeing the fundamental is where there is beating in 10:12:15.<br/>&gt; &gt; Infact it&apos;s the beating of 10:15, and 5:10:15 makes 1:2:3, the main<br/>&gt; &gt; structure of both the minor and major chord. (beeing indeed 2 in 4:5:6)<br/>&gt; &gt; So periodicity gets it wrong in many cases when there are more than 2<br/>&gt; tones<br/>&gt; &gt; in the harmony. Beating doesn&apos;t in these cases. And beating I claim to be<br/>&gt; audible,<br/>&gt; &gt; periodicity without beating I claim not to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With sines, 300, 500, 700, 900, etc will still produce 100 Hz as the<br/>&gt; fundamental. End of story. You don&apos;t need two adjacent overtones for<br/>&gt; the brain to match the fundamental.

But: the effect of the relative phase of sinewaves is<br/>&gt; very apparent, the top plot shows the same waves but with alternate<br/>&gt; sines and cosines - that means, half of the harmonics have been phase<br/>&gt; shifted by 90 degrees.

Are you<br/>suggesting that this could be an eg of a root-note as opposed to<br/>tonic? Eg If C = 1, 2, 4, 8...which is the key or tonic, then 10:12:15<br/>should correspond to around E:G:B.<br/>While the GCD is 1, could it be that the 5 sometimes comes out as the<br/>GCD of 10 and 15, the fifth being a stronger interval? i.e. the E = 5<br/>is both the freq of 10:15 and the root note of an E min triad. In<br/>other words, you seem to have proved that GCD&apos;s come out as upper<br/>harmonics as well??</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=80411 href="#80411">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2009 8:51:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Is there any hard evidence that it can only be because of<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics?</p><p>Does the fact that it occurs when stimuli are presented<br/>binaurally count?<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/bcjobn">http://tinyurl.com/bcjobn</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=80415 href="#80415">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2009 9:20:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>No it does not :)And I was allready aware of binaureal effects, although<br/>your link is not about this specific case of virtual fundamental.<br/>Could put this to the test but i have no reason to beleive why the virtual<br/>fundamental won&apos;t show up in a binaureal test and his would simply mean the<br/>sines add up somewhere in the brain too from the left and right ear, and the<br/>beating would then take place there.<br/>This has allready been reported for beating called binaureal beating.<br/>So I see no difference in this case wether the sines are mixed inside or<br/>outside the brain.<br/>For difference tones (that i still have not heard) it may be a different<br/>story though since they are supposed to be created by distortion in the ear<br/>on sines that are allready added together.<br/>That may make a nice experiment aswell.</p><p>Marcel</p><p>On Sun, Feb 1, 2009 at 5:51 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Marcel de<br/>&gt; Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there any hard evidence that it can only be because of<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustics?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does the fact that it occurs when stimuli are presented<br/>&gt; binaurally count?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bcjobn">http://tinyurl.com/bcjobn</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80417 href="#80417">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2009 11:11:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; your link is not about this specific case of virtual fundamental.</p><p>Care to make a wager on that?  :)</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=80420 href="#80420">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2009 12:52:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jan 31, 2009 at 8:31 PM, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Very easy to subscribe such a thing to psychoacoustics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you can&apos;t find out how it works, just say it&apos;s in the brain.

What I propose is just a model that could be not<br/>faithful in describing what it is actually taking place in the ear,<br/>but it served just to help me understanding some basic concepts.</p><p>I have uploaded in the folder Max here on Tuning list a zipped<br/>folder &quot;<a href="http://orecchio.zip">orecchio.zip</a>&quot; containing an HTML file with the output of a<br/>commented Mathematica notebook. In such notebook I make simple<br/>calculations and visually show how the temporal excitation patterns<br/>of the basilar membrane could look like.</p><p>The basic concept is: a sine wave excites the eardrum and is<br/>transmitted to the cochlea. The basilar membrane acts as a kind of<br/>fourier analyzer, or filter bank, or whatever, the main fact being<br/>that it vibrates with the highest amplitude at a certain position<br/>corresponding to the excitation frequency f0. Also nearby parts<br/>vibrate, with decreasing amplitude getting farther from the position<br/>corresponding to f0.</p><p>I have modeled the envelope of vibration amplitude of the basilar<br/>membrane as a Gaussian bell (but modeling with a Lorentzian or other<br/>shapes does not change the qualitative results). The only important<br/>parameter is the fractional width of the envelope, that basically<br/>corresponds to a kind of &quot;quality factor&quot; Q: that means, if f0 = 1000<br/>Hz and Q = 10, then the width of the envelope is 1000/10=100 Hz.<br/>Roughly, this is the concept. I have arbitrarily chosen such Q as 15,<br/>but it could be changed to compare its effect.</p><p>Please note that ALL the basilar membrane region is vibrating at f0,<br/>both the section corresponding to the amplitude maximum (f0) and the<br/>nearby sections that do not correspond to that center frequency. I<br/>mean, sections of the basilar membrane that are off-center still<br/>vibrate at the same frequency, not at a different one!</p><p>If I have two sinewaves with different enough frequency, they will<br/>excite different parts of the basilar menbrane - not overlapping.<br/>Vibrations start to overlap when the frequency difference is<br/>comparable to the bell width.</p><p>I have tried to see how excitation is distributed along the basilar<br/>membrane (according to the present model of course) for common dyads<br/>and triads. What I conclude for now is the following. It can be<br/>observed that, although we might hear beatings, there are cases in<br/>which they correspond to an overall loudness change in time (at all<br/>positions on the basilar membrane, or uniformly distributed on it),<br/>while there are cases in which the strongest beating effect<br/>(modulation amplitude) is localized at certain positions of the<br/>basilar membrane, while others are almost unaffected (ie they do not<br/>experience strong amplitude modulation).</p><p>If you wish, you can have a look at the plots in the file and freely<br/>ask me for clarifications, in case.</p><p>What I would like to understand now is: are there categories of such<br/>situations (i.e. basilar membrane excitation patterns) when the<br/>hearing results more or less consonant or dissonant - I mean, from my<br/>point of view, more or less &quot;annoying&quot; - JUST on the basis of these<br/>physical effects (ie, not yet resorting to brain&apos;s role)? I am not<br/>denying the brain&apos;s role, but I am just trying to explore this issue,<br/>to understand what could be just physical and what cannot be.</p><p>All suggestions are welcome....</p><p>Max</p></div><h3><a id=80427 href="#80427">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2009 4:30:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel wrote:</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t tried yet.<br/>&gt; Can you share the mp3?</p><p>I thought you could listen on your own when I linked you to the &bdquo;inharmonic2.rar&ldquo; archive.

The 100Hz periodicity is there<br/>&gt; because all the frequencies are multiples of 100, not because of beating.<br/>&gt; The phase patterns start repeating every 100th of a second because all of<br/>&gt; the periods fit an integer number of times into that. -- You know what? Tak&eacute;<br/>&gt; two sharp periods (like sawtooth waves, for example), one of 3Hz and another<br/>&gt; of 5Hz, and play them both at the same time. Whatever in-phase or<br/>&gt; out-of-phase you play them, soon you&apos;ll realize that the periodicity of 1Hz<br/>&gt; is inevitable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80439 href="#80439">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2009 12:49:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>An example to put this to rest:<br/><a href="http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/vf35.wav">http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/vf35.wav</a></p><p>This timbre uses partials 3 and 5 of the overtone series.

If the membrane is excited by countinuous tones (not<br/>beating) the brain will be happy to be capable to recognize tones.<br/>If the whole excitation shape is beating, that is, the overall<br/>intensity is modulated in time, the brain will be happy as well,<br/>especially if beatings are slow (this will make sound more &quot;live&quot;).<br/>If instead there are regions of the basilar membrane that are<br/>excited continuously, and at the same time different regions are<br/>excited with modulated intensity (beatings), the brain will get<br/>confused and we will experience annoyance (dissonance?)</p><p>The indicator is simply the following: loudness modulation at the<br/>position (on the basilar membrane) of maximum beating (that is:<br/>between the two tones) minus the loudness modulation in<br/>correspondence to one of the two tones (let&apos;s say, the first one,<br/>but the result is unchanged if we choose the other one).</p><p>To explain visually: I have calculated maps of excitation of the<br/>basilar membrane, with the frequency (= position on the membrane) on<br/>the X axis, time on the Y axis, and the grey tone intensity<br/>represents the deformation of the basilar membrane (that is, the<br/>strength of its excitation as a function of the position on the<br/>membrane, and of time). If the tones are separated enough (let&apos;s<br/>say, at least a minor third apart), a typical plot is a couple of<br/>vertical white bands (the two - about steady - tones) with an<br/>intermediate region on which beatings appear (black spots, with a<br/>periodicity equal to the beating period). If the two tones become<br/>very close, then the overall envelope will be modulated (continuous<br/>bands will be &quot;broken&quot;). If you like, you can have a look to the<br/>pictures within the HTML page &quot;orecchio&quot; uploaded in my dir Max on<br/>Tuning List.</p><p>If you take the difference between maximum and minimum amplitude in<br/>correspondence of the black spots, and subtract the difference<br/>between maximum and minimum amplitude at one of the tones, this will<br/>give you an indication of the difference of beatings experienced by<br/>the ear in its different regions of the basilar membrane. I have<br/>called this indicator &quot;dissonance indicator&quot;. For example, if the<br/>two tones are very close, the overall pattern will beat, so the two<br/>differences in maximum and minimum loudness on one tone and between<br/>the tones will be almost the same, and their difference small (the<br/>brain is not confused: overall beating). If the two tones are far<br/>apart, modulation of one tone will be small and modulation in<br/>between will be small as well, so their difference will be small<br/>(the brain is not confused: no beatings, only steady tones). In the<br/>intermediate situation, there will be a strong modulation in between<br/>the two tones, and some amount of modulation also on each of the<br/>tones. The bigger the modulation in between the tones we have, minus<br/>the smallest modulation on the tone itself we have, generates the<br/>highest confusion (bigger difference in behaviour between two<br/>different parts of the basilar membrane).</p><p>By calculating basilar membrane excitation patterns at a number of<br/>dyadic intervals, and evaluating the simple &quot;dissonance&quot; indicator</p><p>[Amax(fcenter)-Amin(fcenter)]-[Amax(ftone)-Amin(ftone)]</p><p>(where A is amplitude, max stands for maximum and min for minimum,<br/>fcenter is center frequency between the two tones of the dyad, ftone<br/>is the frequency of one of the two tones)</p><p>one gets the plot reported in the file &quot;dissonance20.gif&quot;. See note<br/>below for details.</p><p>Now, you see yourself the agreement (especially in the shape) with<br/>Plomp&amp;Levelt&apos;s dissonance curve. Of course, the indicator I choose<br/>may be too simple, my modeling for the membrane&apos;s vibration not<br/>accurate, etc. but basically my hypothesis (that dissonance could be<br/>related to the presence of regions of the basilar membrane where<br/>beatings take place while they don&apos;t in others at the same time)<br/>seems not to be contradicted by experimental verifications<br/>(Plomp&amp;Levelt&apos;s curve is experimental).</p><p>I hope this outcome could be of interest to someone in the list<br/>curious (as I am) about possible mechanisms (physical and not)<br/>underlying the sensation of consonance and dissonance of musical<br/>sound. And in any case your comments would be most welcome.</p><p>Max</p><p>[note: The 20 in the file name represents the quality factor Q<br/>(damping degree, the highest the Q the lowest the damping)<br/>characteristic of the liquid inside the cochlea; if I choose Q = 15<br/>(that was my first choice - pictures in HTML output &quot;orecchio&quot; are<br/>calculated for that case) one gets the calculated &quot;dissonance&quot;<br/>points peaked at a lower frequency than in the case of Q = 20, but<br/>decaying too rapidly at higher frequencies. So I prefer to show the<br/>first one, but one may calculate the same points for any Q.

This creates a nonlinear oscillator system accounting for the high dynamic range of the ear as well as for the enhanced pitch discrimination capability that would not be possible if only the &quot;passive&quot; behaviour of the basilar membrane was involved. This point seems to be widely accepted in scientific literature by now.</p><p>The above modeling assumes a nonlinear response of the ear including a third-order nonlinearity (and excluding a 2nd order one). This implies that sum (f1+f2) and difference (f1-f2) frequencies are not among the ones generated by nonlinearities at the level of hair cells (they could be nonetheless obtained at a higher level, i.e. due to brain processing). Third-order nonlinearities produce instead combination tones of the form 2f1-f2 and 2f2-f1. Therefore, were the stymulus a dyad with ratio x, frequencies proportional to 2-x,1,x,2x-1 would be present at the hair cell level (that means e.g. for x=5/4: 3/4,1,5/4,6/4 - but considering that 3/4 and 6/4 should be weaker, being combination tones).</p><p>Interestingly, in Fig. 4 of PNAS paper the effect of a two pure-tone stymulus on this kind of nonlinear system is analyzed and an interesting discussion on pitch discrimination and dissonance is proposed. If you cannot access the paper text from the PNAS webpage I can send a file to whom is interested.</p><p>A few considerations from my side: when looking at the basilar membrane envelope shapes measured by von Beseky on dead tissue, a very poor discrimination effect is found (it would correspond to a quality factor of about 2 in a simple harmonic oscillator model - that means, for a frequency of 1000 Hz, the width at half maximum of the excitation envelope is around 500 Hz!). This could not allow &quot;physical&quot; pitch discrimination (although the brain, by counting pulses or measuring frequency itself, could of course be able to reach any performance even with no aid of physical filters or analyzers, as far as we can tell...). However, the active system described by Julicher et al seems to yield results corresponding roughly to a quality factor of about 10-15 (that means, the width at 1000 Hz is 70-100 Hz), with of course the additional effect of introducing the above mentioned third-order nonlinearities. In the model of basilar membrane response I was trying to envisage (message n. 80426), I have used quality factors of 10-15; such quality factors would correspond to the behaviour of the active system, and not just to that of the passive one. It is not yet clear to me whether the acoustic excitation transferred to the basilar membrane turns in a similar spatial pattern for a linear system as well as in presence of such a nonlinear, active system.</p><p>Anyway, this paper seems to me a good route to follow in order to find out which effects can be ascribed to physical phenomena - vs the ones that can only be explained by the role of brain - in the musical consonance/dissonance issue.</p><p>Max</p></div><h3><a id=82184 href="#82184">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2009 11:19:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;massimilianolabardi&quot; &lt;labardi@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I have found a paper in the scientific literature entitled<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Physical basis of two-tone interference in hearing&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; by F.
