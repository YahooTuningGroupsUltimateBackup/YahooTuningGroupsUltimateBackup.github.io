Is it a 3/2 or a sharp 5th? Danged if I know...I recall a friend of mine hearing some of my 34 tone music, and commenting on how &quot;relaxed&quot; it sounded; he said something to the effect of &quot;this is how music is supposed to sound/feel.&quot; I agree, 34 does, indeed, have a very sort of &quot;centered&quot; feel (for lack of a better term). And, I&apos;ve never been that worried about a few cents here or there...as Wendy Carlos has pointed out, there&apos;s always going to be some sort of physical error in tuning acoustic instruments anyway...perfect/precise intonation is mostly theoretical (except on newfangled electronic instruments, of course)...and when talking with John Starrett a few years ago, about organ tunings in Bach&apos;s time, he remarked, not without humor, that as soon as an organ was tuned back then, it went out of that tune almost immediately anyway.</p><p>   And, a favorite quote of mine is regarding the lute: someone said if you owned a lute and lived 80 years, at least 65 of those years were spent tuning your lute. When I play my nylon string guitar on gigs, it is constantly slipping out of tune; as soon as I take it out of the case, the room temperature affects it; then, when the room temperature changes because people fill the room, it changes again...and the heat from my hands causes constant changes as well. I retune from song to song, key to key....Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div><h3><a id=72997 href="#72997">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2007 12:13:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Regarding 5ths tuned sharp...the 5th in 34 eq is about 706 cents;<br/>after playing and composing in this tuning for many years, I think it<br/>sounds great, whether I&apos;m using it melodically or harmonically.

In the 5-limit, 34 is detuned only a litte, perhaps by<br/>an amount some would find more or less optimal. An interesting<br/>comparison might be to the 46-et 5-limit, which has a fifth less sharp,<br/>but a sharper third. Does that still sound relaxed, do you think?</p></div>
