Three or four times<br/>&gt; over the next year or so I would find<br/>&gt; COLOSSAL packages of miscellaneous (historical<br/>&gt; and contemporary**) microtonal literature<br/>&gt; waiting for me at the Rutland post office...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can only guess how many times Brian has so<br/>&gt; generously given up his time and energy<br/>&gt; (not to mention postage expenses!) in this<br/>&gt; fashion - But I&#xFFFD;d be willing to bet that<br/>&gt; it&#xFFFD;s fairly emblematic of the type of person<br/>&gt; he is.</p><p>It&apos;s entirely characteristic of him.  Just<br/>let him know you like microtonal music, and<br/>you&apos;d better be prepared to *carry* his response<br/>home with you!</p><p>I&apos;m surprised you only got printed info - he<br/>always sent me tapes and CDs too!</p><p>&gt; **One of my personal favorites was Brian&#xFFFD;s<br/>&gt; own &quot;Brief History of Microtonality&quot; which<br/>&gt; would help reaffirm in me a conviction that<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;... antithetical contrariety seemed<br/>&gt; to be [and often for better _and_ worse] a deeply<br/>&gt; lodged fundamental cog in the tuning narrative...</p><p>I must confess that Brian himself *is* very guilty<br/>of &quot;antithetical contrariety&quot; - but he does have<br/>a LOT of references stored away in that amazing<br/>mind of his to back up what he says.</p><p>[Erlich:]<br/>&gt; although Brian McLaren is a fine composer and<br/>&gt; promulgator of microtonal enthusiasm, his<br/>&gt; analyses, including music-theoretical ones,<br/>&gt; are plagued with errors.</p><p>As always, one must read the work of others<br/>with a critical mind, and LISTEN to the<br/>illustrations! (something Paul *always* does!)</p><p>And I agree that something published (in print<br/>*or* on the web) which is known to have errors<br/>should have an errata or warning published<br/>with it.</p><p>I&apos;d also like to use this opportunity to<br/>acknowledge Paul&apos;s erudition and precision<br/>as a music-theorist, and to publicly thank<br/>him for taking the time to crtitique my book.</p><p>- Monzo<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
