I might be inclined to treat this briefly in the<br/>&quot;Meantone and Modal Music&quot; section, and then to do a separate section<br/>on circulating 31-note meantone -- maybe wisely resisting the<br/>temptation of such terms as 31-qET (31-note quasi-equal temperament)<br/>or 31-NEDO (31-near-equal division of the octave).</p><p>Also, maybe the area of Pythagorean tuning in medieval Europe, Gothic<br/>music, and neo-Gothic music and tunings might be an area where I could<br/>write some FAQ entries. In good part, some brief statements with links<br/>to Tuning List or other Web resources might be a convenient approach,<br/>if such links would be in keeping with the FAQ style.</p><p>Given my tendency sometimes to go into details, I&apos;d want to second the<br/>opinion that a main goal of a FAQ is to facilitate orientation and<br/>recognition of certain common Tuning List terms and topics. Thus &quot;What<br/>is neo-Gothic?&quot; should have a brief answer, with at least one humorous<br/>reference to 24-tET, and maybe links to some material in our archives.<br/>The longer version I could maybe write for the Monz&apos;s _Dictionary_.</p><p>At some risk to our mutual sanity, I may have a go at &quot;What is JI?&quot; --<br/>maybe exhibiting a rather strange sense of &quot;fun.&quot;</p><p>There are some general topics where maybe I might contribute, at least in<br/>part, by offering some qualifications to generalizations often quite<br/>accurate for the musics on which they are based, but not necessarily so<br/>accurate for other styles. Of course, this is a role which many or all of<br/>us could play on inviting occasions.</p><p>Incidentally, please let me add two humorous (I hope) points.</p><p>First, as already suggested, if the FAQ includes neo-Gothic, my<br/>neo-Gothic FAQ entries should include:</p><p>  Why is 24-tET unconventional and interesting for neo-Gothic music?</p><p>Secondly, in view of the use of terms such as &quot;pre-tonal&quot; (quite<br/>popular in recent musicological studies), I&apos;m not sure if something<br/>like neo-Gothic is pre-tonal or post-tonal, or maybe pre-pantonal or<br/>post-pantonal as Joseph Pehrson might possibly say.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=19308 href="#19308">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2001 11:12:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Regarding the FAQ, I suggest we not rely on links to posts in the<br/>tuning list archives.

In the process of reading the postings, various holes in my<br/>understanding have been filled in. Like the assumption I had when I first<br/>saw the extra t in x-tET. At the time I filled in the blanks and figured it<br/>meant tone, not tempered. I suppose I could&apos;ve asked a few questions, but<br/>I&apos;m one of those people who don&apos;t read the manual for a new software program<br/>until after I&apos;ve bumbled about in it for a while and learned by intuition.<br/>My approach to JI, microtuning and what I call natural harmony seem to be<br/>the same. Play, make sounds, sing, listen to sounds that other people make,<br/>read some books, play some more, fill in the blanks later.</p><p>Personally, I learn a lot by hearing multiple perspectives on the same<br/>subject. Just in the same way I didn&apos;t buy only one book on JI or<br/>microtuning or only one LP (there, I&apos;ve given away my age) of one composer<br/>when I got interested in this subject.

But if you come from a part of the world that not been changed musically by western culture then it is likely that you will be using one, or some of the other myriad of possibilities that exist.*</p><p>&quot;My musical training is just the standard western type one.</p><p>&quot;I can understand the twelve tones, but what does equal refer to ?<br/>Also what is temperament ? ...They never mentioned this in music class.&quot;</p><p>*Your teachers probably didn&apos;t know what tuning system they were using<br/>either !</p><p>Ok. Imagine an infinite continuum of pitch. From very low to very high. You could select pitches for your musical instruments from anywhere along this pitch continuum [P.C from now on]. You also could select any amount of tones from this P.C. Now which tones would you select ?*</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know... I suppose I would pick out the ones that sounded the<br/>best.&quot;</p><p>*Yes so would I. So lets do that. I&apos;m going to take two sound sources<br/>playing harmonic timbres, I&apos;ll explain what a harmonic timbre is in a moment but for the time being some examples of harmonic timbres are trumpets [brass], the bowed and plucked string family, woodwinds and the human voice.</p><p>All these timbres are quite musical. Do you agree ?*</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>*Good ! Now I&apos;ll take, say, two trombones playing a unison [same tone or note] and then tell Trombone 1 to hold that note.  I&apos;ll then instruct Trombone 2, to slowly gliss up through the P.C.</p><p>When you hear a note that you like say  &quot;Hold it!&quot;</p><p>Ok,  let&apos;s begin. Trombone 2 do your thing !*</p><p>[Trombone 1 slides up the P.C, maintaining a constant volume. It reaches a<br/>subminor third [7/6]]</p><p>&quot;Hold it !&quot; [Trombone holds the note at the indicated pitch]</p><p>*Ok, so why did you choose this interval ?*</p><p>&quot;Before this point It sounded rough and made a sort or warbling tremolo sound. Like an opera singer ! And then the warbling slowed down until it became all smooth and there was no longer any tremolo.&quot;</p><p>*What you heard are called beats. Now I&apos;ll explain harmonic timbres to you. Trombone 2 is playing a tone now. I can sing that pitch. [He does so. And sings a unison with the trombone.] But that is not the only tone it is playing.</p><p>There are additional fainter tones [also called overtones, partials or<br/>harmonics] at higher pitches that blend in with the fundamental pitch [tonic].</p><p>Like when a string quartet plays a chord starting and ending together. It all sounds like one instrument.</p><p>Well the other tones in the trombone are like that but they<br/>are very simple instruments and they all sound the same.</p><p>If they played on their own they would sound very boring. These instruments are called sine tones or sine waves. The pitches of these sine waves follow a certain numerical relationship: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7 ... and so on. The numbers are called the harmonic series.*</p><p>&quot;What do the numbers mean ?&quot;</p><p>*They denote a relationship, a ratio if you will between two periodic<br/>vibrations.*</p><p>&quot;What is a periodic vibration ?&quot;</p><p>*Well it&apos;s when the air that sound travels in, compresses and expands in a consistent pattern for a certain length of time.</p><p>Periodic vibrations that create these variations in pressure, more times in a given unit of time are heard as higher in pitch than those for whom the frequency of vibration is less per unit of time.</p><p>In my previous example the number 1:1 is the same as the two trombones playing in unison. In the next one i.e. 1:2. It is like Trombone 2 playing an octave above Trombone 1. The periodic vibration of Trombone 2 completes twice as many cycles [vibrations] as Trombone 1 in the same amount of time.</p><p>So we have looked at the pitch of tones a bit, but what happens when we add two simple or sine waves together ?</p><p>Well, if we begin the sounds at the same time all that will happen is that the combined sound will be louder [amplitude].</p><p>But what happens if we start one sound at a different time ?<br/>This is called the phase of the sound.</p><p>When two waves are out of phase [i.e. they do not begin at the same time] the volume will be affected. Sometimes one wave will want to compress air molecules and the other will want to do the opposite causing a reduction in volume.</p><p>Phase is measured in degrees just like a circle. Two waves at 0 degrees phase will be in phase, at 180 degrees the wave is completely out of phase.</p><p>If the waves have identical amplitudes then there will be silence at 180 degrees.</p><p>The opposing forces have cancelled themselves out ! Any other phase between 0 and 180 degrees will at times increase the amplitude of the overall wave and at other times diminish the volume. At 360 degrees the wave is in phase but one cycle displaced. Anywhere between 360 and 180 degrees is the same as before, i.e. alternating increasing and diminishing amplitude.</p><p>Beats are very similar to sounds of the same pitch that are out of phase.<br/>For instance if you get two waves where the partials do not coincide exactly the difference in frequency will cause beats to occur at that difference of frequency.</p><p>Just like in the previous example at times the two waves support<br/>each other and at other times they act like they are out of phase. There is a reduction in volume. To tune notes to those places where no beats are detectable is called just Intonation (JI), those places where there are no beats between harmonic timbres are expressible as small whole number ratios.</p><p>There is still much to learn in this area and some composers and theorists welcome a broader definition of JI. One that would include all tunings expressible as whole number ratios. This is in line with a realization that psycho-acoustic investigation is in its infancy and has so far mostly dealt with dyads [two notes at once].</p><p>Investigations into chords with harmonic timbres show ratios based on higher primes can be heard as consonant in the context of chords that follow the harmonic series.</p><p>Anyway let&apos;s continue our experiment. Trombone 2 continue to Gliss...<br/>[They continue up the P.C, stopping whenever they hear an interval that is consonant. Soon they have ten notes that were selected for their special properties. In the order that they were found they are 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 7:5, 3:2, 8:5, 5:3, 7:4 &amp; 2:1].</p><p>OK what interval of those did you find the most consonant?*</p><p>&quot;Well the fifth sounded the most pleasing I guess. And the major third was very sweet too.&quot;</p><p>*It is subjective, within certain physical parameters...but most people agree with you and find the 3:2. fifth the most stable. Now let&apos;s make a 12 tone scale by tuning 12 of these consonant 3:2 fifths on top of each other. Exactly like the standard circle of fifths you may be familiar with.</p><p>To help us I have an electronic instrument that is capable of producing any desired frequency.*</p><p>[The instrument looks like a standard keyboard with a tuning knob above each key.] The student tunes 12 pure fifths starting from C:<br/>C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C# - G# - D# - A# - F - C&apos;.<br/>This tone is slightly over seven octaves above the initial C. He presses a button and the pitch automatically gets lowered by exactly six octaves.]</p><p>*OK now tune the next available digital to a pure octave above the initial C.*</p><p>[The student tweaks the knob until it a sounds a pure octave [2:1] above the starting C. This octave is on the key that would normally correspond to C# in normal western nomenclature]</p><p>[The student sounds the octave] &quot;There ! I don&apos;t think I could get a more consonant interval than that.&quot;</p><p>*Yes, that definitely sounds like a pure octave to me. Ok now play the note that you have on the C&apos; digital. Remember this is the note that was tuned after we took 12 pure fifths starting on the C digital an octave below. Compare this note to the one that you have just tuned to the octave.*</p><p>[The student plays the keys together and finds that they do not sound a unison as he had thought they would.]</p><p>&quot;Hey ! These two tones are different.[He tries them in succession.] The note I tuned from the circle of fifths is sharper than the one I tuned an octave above the starting pitch. What gives ! &quot;</p><p>*Well your circle of fifths is really a spiral of fifths. That is, if you tune your fifths so that they are pure i.e. beatless no matter how many fifths you tune they will never match up to an octave of your starting tone. 12 perfect fifths will always exceed 7 octaves [3^12:2^12 &gt; 2^7:1^7 ].</p><p>&quot;But I do it all the time on my electronic keyboard at home !&quot;</p><p>*Yes that is right. I have your keyboard here today. It is tuned to the system of Twelve Tone Equal Temperament that I mentioned at the beginning of your lesson. I can now explain to you exactly what 12-tet means.</p><p>O.K compare one of those perfect beatless fifths with one of the fifths on your keyboard.</p><p>[The student tries both as instructed and repeats it a few times listening for the difference [if any]. He plays the notes in succession and simultaneously.]</p><p>&quot;I well the fifths on my keyboard sound a little bit rougher when sounded together, I don&apos;t think I can hear the difference when I play the fifths melodically.&quot;</p><p>*I told you before that 12 just fifths exceed 7 octaves a little bit.</p><p>The difference between 12 just fifths and 7 octaves is an interval called the  Pythagorean comma. This interval has a frequency ratio of 531441:524288. About 23.5 cents.*</p><p>&quot;Cents ? What does money have to do with it ?!&quot;</p><p>*Oh ! I apologize. Cents are a method of measuring how big intervals are. They are based on the 12-tet tuning system that almost everyone in the western world uses. For comparison an octave is 1200 cents and each semitone is 100 cents.*</p><p>&quot;So this Pythagorean comma is pretty small. Less that an 8th tone ?&quot;</p><p>*Yes that&apos;s right. Also you may have guessed that you would need quite a lot of<br/>pitches if you were to keep all the fifths just. Taking 13 3:2&apos;s [fifths] from your starting tone leads you into a new note that is close to the first 3:2 that you tuned from the original tone.</p><p>Also any 3:2&apos;s tuned from these tones will lead you into more notes very close to notes we already have. That is assuming octave equivalency.</p><p>&quot;What is octave equivalency ?&quot;</p><p>*Well it is like when you sing a C and then you sing a C&quot; two octaves up. It is perceptually the same note. It is still a C despite having a frequency four times that of your original C.*</p><p>&quot;Oh I C !: )&quot;</p><p>*A spiral of just fifths or any just interval can generate an infinity of pitches. After spiraling around for a while you will find that after travelling a certain distance with an interval there will be certain points that come close to octaves of your original for instance 12 fifths, 29 fifths, 41 fifths, 53 fifths etc come close to octaves of your original tone.</p><p>The tuning system we use...*</p><p>&quot;...this 12tet thing right ?&quot;</p><p>*Yes. 12tet takes 1/12 of the Pythagorean comma and takes this amount from each of the 12 fifths. Consequently in 12tet each fifth is exactly 700 cents. In comparison a just fifth is 701.955 cents. All the intervals in 12tet in some combination fit into an octave. This is not true of just intervals*</p><p>&quot;What a great idea !&quot;</p><p>*Well it is a fairly good idea for the music that existed at the time when 12tet was suggested. 12tet was known about since 350 BC. In the renaissance era when<br/>Marin Mersenne tabulated the correct proportions of 12tet the primary<br/>consonances were fourths, fifths and octaves. These are the intervals that stay most in tune in 12tet. The 12tet fourth is 500 cents which is very close to the just fourth at 498.045 cents. And of course the octave is just. This was a medieval inheritance from the ancient Greek Pythagoras. His school considered the octave, fifth and fourth to be the only perfect consonances. Renaissance theorists though began realizing that thirds and sixths were also consonant.</p><p>These weren&apos;t the Pythagorean major and minor thirds with the<br/>dissonant proportions of 81/64 and 32/27 respectively but were based on the prime number 5.<br/> This is the fifth harmonic and created the proportions of 5/4 and 6/5 [major and minor]. Presumably the general population had been using such intervals in harmonic singing all along.<br/> It was only the medieval church musicians and theorists who clung to the idea that the numbers 2 and 3 could generate all the necessary musical resources.</p><p>12tet perfectly matched the Pythagorean musical thinking of the Middle Ages. But from the renaissance onwards the 12tet that was being increasingly adopted was forced into playing [esp. keyboard] music that treated thirds and sixths as stable consonances.*</p><p>&quot;Does 12tet approximate 5/4 and 5/3 etc. well ?&quot;</p><p>*No not at all. 5/4 is 386.314 cents while the 12tet major third is 400.00 cents. The just major sixth: 5/3 is 884.359 cents compared to the 12tet version which is 900 cents. When you did your listening experiment earlier today you found the following intervals consonant 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 7:5, 3:2, 8:5, 5:3, 7:4 2:1.</p><p>From this lot 12tet only approximates 3:2 and 4:3 well. It obviously represents 2:1 exactly because this is the interval that has been carved up into 12 equal divisions.*</p><p>&quot;I guess that those other intervals are not that important ?        The music I hear on the radio-blues, rock and pop all use 12tet. It all sounds pretty good to me.&quot;</p><p>*That&apos;s not true. Those other intervals, and many more, are very important. For one the flattened thirds, tritones and minor sevenths beloved of blues have been shown to correspond to the just intervals 7:6, 7:5 and 7:4 respectively.</p><p>A vocalist can sing any tone he likes and so can many skilled saxophonists, guitarists and other instrumentalists capable of expressive intonation. The problems rests mainly with keyboard instruments and the lack of awareness of alternatives to 12tet. Once you realize that probably much of your favorite music uses intervals outside of the 12tet domain you can start to explore your tonal resources in a more informed way. Once you start to tune to different systems you just might get addicted. No doubt you will be glad that you discovered that such worlds exist.*</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>1.
