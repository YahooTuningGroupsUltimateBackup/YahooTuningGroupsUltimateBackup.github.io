It may be classically correct that Bb is 16/9 times C<br/>&gt;or whatever (which it would be if played with an F) but the raios would<br/>&gt;then be 36:45:54:64 which is impossibly complex to be &quot;intentional&quot;.<br/>&gt;IMO the old theory does not match the composers &quot;real musical intention&quot;<br/>&gt;which must be 4:5:6:7 even if the instrument cannot produce that as<br/>&gt;ratios of 36:45:54:64 can have no meaning at all.</p><p>This may well be true of the blues, but I suspect that in most cases if you<br/>presented a composer who had assumed a 12-tET or meantone keyboard, with a<br/>4:5:6:7 chord where he or she had specified a dominant 7th chord, they<br/>would find it quite strange. I tend to think of it as an augmented 6th<br/>chord or a harmonic 7th chord and quite different from a dominant 7th.</p><p>You are ignoring the possibility of chords which, although they have quite<br/>high numbers when represented as a subset of the harmonic series, contain<br/>intervals or sub-chords, all of which are low on the harmonic series. i.e.<br/>multiple virtual fundamentals.</p><p>One such possibility for the dominant 7th is<br/>C E G Bb    Errors in 12-tET<br/>------------------------------<br/>4:5:6       +13.6c, -15.6c, -2.0c<br/>    5:6     -15.6c<br/>  5 : 7     +17.5c<br/>5  :  9     -17.6c</p><p>Note that the last 3 lines above can be abbreviated to 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5, not<br/>that I think this gives any added consonance over the individual intervals<br/>involved, unlike the 4:5:6.</p><p>Note also that this version of the dominant 7th cannot be consistently<br/>tuned in JI, the 5:7 being inconsistent with all the others. So it doesn&apos;t<br/>even _have_ a representation as x:y:z:w. However the resulting 36/35<br/>quarter-tone error is extremely well distributed in 12-tET.</p><p>In contrast, the proposed 4:5:6:7 has 12-tET errors of 31 and 33 cents in<br/>the 4:7 and 6:7.</p><p>&gt;The problem is that<br/>&gt;apart from the main notes in the key the others have multiple possible<br/>&gt;different meanings and so a strict rule will often be wrong.</p><p>Indeed. Which is one reason I&apos;ll stick to working on adaptive meantone<br/>without ratios of 7, for now.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/13/1999 7:42:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;It may be classically correct that Bb is 16/9 times C<br/>&gt;&gt;or whatever (which it would be if played with an F) but the raios would<br/>&gt;&gt;then be 36:45:54:64 which is impossibly complex to be &quot;intentional&quot;.</p><p>Monz and Dave Keenan said I am wrong, and they are right.<br/>These ratios are possible.
