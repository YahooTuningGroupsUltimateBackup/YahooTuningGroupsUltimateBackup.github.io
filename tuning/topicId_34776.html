The files<br/>area is free and it wouldn&apos;t be off topic there, if one<br/>posted to the group about it.</p><p>I think if one adds files to a group it&apos;s best to send a message<br/>to the group saying so - if not for every one, at least do it<br/>so that the members know about them.</p><p>I&apos;ve made tuning2 open to the searches now, as some find it that way.</p><p>At the time all the comments I had on it were positive. However<br/>if it doesn&apos;t seem such a good way of doing it, I could do<br/>the same thing just as well using a web site.</p><p>I&apos;ve added the miracle_tuning group to it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=35130 href="#35130">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2002 7:13:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph</p><p>Yes I&apos;m joking, tongue firmly in cheek!</p><p>I did suggest tuning_gossip before - if a group has<br/>been very active, and then asleep for a while, perhaps<br/>posting a few files to it and sending e-mails about it to the<br/>group may wake it up. That&apos;s not the same thing at all.</p><p>If one wants to be in the spirit of the tuning_gossip<br/>group one could post large files there that one then<br/>will remove after a few days, as we do on MMM<br/>- so they will be things of short term interest<br/>- and use tuning for the things of more longer term<br/>interest.</p><p>&quot;<br/>A place for microtonalists to post gossip - anything that is of<br/>momentary short term interest, or of no interest at all for that<br/>matter, or only of interest to a couple of other members.<br/>&quot;</p><p>-if it is of short term interest it would be okay.</p><p>However, I do think one would need to post to it<br/>rather than just add files to a group without saying<br/>anything to its members - that doesn&apos;t seem right<br/>to me, even if it is a tuning group off-shoot.</p><p>A cc of ones post to the tuning group about the<br/>files would be okay.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
