When the listener listens, he<br/>interprets one single intonation however big a vibrato or glissando. One<br/>violin teacher did a very good analogy comparing a vibrato to a hand-<br/>clapping. It is the moment when the hands come together that counts.<br/>It is like hearing your mummy&apos;s voice in a noisy crowd of people. You<br/>select what you want to hear. Therefore, I do not trust spectrometers a<br/>lot. Usually Beatles only &quot;arrives&quot; only for a very very brief instance at<br/>the intended intonation even on a very long note.</p><p>Linus.</p></div>
