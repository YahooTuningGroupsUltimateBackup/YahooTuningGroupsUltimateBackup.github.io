I&apos;m aware of only one example, the &apos;Burletta&apos;<br/>section of the 3rd movement of his 6th (and last) String<br/>Quartet [1939].</p><p>Here, he used down-pointing arrows above the notes to indicate<br/>&apos;a 1/4-tone lower&apos;, and used the quarter-tones in only one<br/>spot in the two violin parts, one part a quarter-tone lower<br/>than the other, creating a &apos;quasi-unison&apos;, or, as Vyshnegradski<br/>called it, an &apos;emphatic or expressive unision&apos;.<br/>[See Vyschnegradski, _Manual of Quartertone Harmony_,<br/>transl. Darreg, in _Xenharmonikon 6_, p 29].</p><p>I know of no other microtones in Bartok&apos;s own music.<br/>Any illumination would be appreciated.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
