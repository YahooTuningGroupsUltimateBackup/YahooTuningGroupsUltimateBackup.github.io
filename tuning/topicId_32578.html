Sometimes these principles are<br/>even deduced from what we know of the physical nature of sound, and<br/>as a result are given what seems to me an essentially specious<br/>validity.  I say &quot;essentially specious&quot; because while the physical<br/>facts are clear enough, there are always gaps, incomplete or<br/>unconvincing transitions, left between the realm of physics and the<br/>realm of musical experience, even if we leave &quot;art&quot; out of account.<br/>Many ingenious and even brilliant attempts, it is true, have been<br/>made to bridge these gaps.  One of the difficulties of trying to do<br/>so, however, is apparent, in the way in which the physical fact of<br/>the overtone series has been used by various harmonic theorists to<br/>support very different and even diametrically contradictory ideas.<br/>Because the first six partial tones obviously correspond exactly with<br/>the tones composing the major triad [well, you know what he means,<br/>ed. JP], theorists are fond of calling the latter the &quot;chord of<br/>nature.&quot;  On that premise, Heinrich Schenker, for example, a<br/>brilliant and at times profound writer, has reconstructed the theory<br/>of tonality as basically an elaboration of that chord or<br/>its &quot;artificial&quot; counterpart, the minor triad.  He bases what he<br/>considers the immutable laws of music on these deductions, even<br/>though in doing so he virtually excludes the music written before<br/>Bach, after Brahms, and outside of a rather narrowly Germanic orbit.<br/>Furthermore, what is perhaps even more problematical, he is forced to<br/>disregard the evolutionary factors within even those limits, and to<br/>regard the musical language of Bach and Mozart and Beethoven and<br/>Brahms in exactly the same light; and he remonstrates with even those<br/>composers whenever he catches them punching holes in the system he<br/>has thus established.  Or again, Paul Hindemith, also a brilliant and<br/>certainly a more creative writer, has carefully examined the overtone<br/>series and made very interesting deductions regarding it, but he<br/>gives it an even more outspoken status than has Schenker, as a kind<br/>of musical court of last appeal, with the triad as final arbiter, on<br/>the basis not of musical experience, but of physical science.  Other<br/>writers, however, noting that the overtone series extends well beyond<br/>the first six partials, have found in this fact justification for<br/>harmonic daring of a much more far-reaching type, and have in some<br/>cases sought to discover new harmonic principles based on the<br/>systematic use of these upper partials.</p><p>Such speculations have been in many cases the product of brilliant<br/>minds, of indisputable musical authority, and I do not wish in any<br/>way to minimize this fact.  Yet it would be easy to point out that<br/>each author, in a manner quite consistent with his musical stature,<br/>found in the overtone series a tool he could adapt to his individual<br/>and peculiar purpose.  Above all it seems to me clear that physics<br/>and music are different spheres, and that, though they certainly<br/>touch at moments, the connection between them is an occasional and<br/>circumstantial, not an essential, one.  For the musician at any level<br/>of sophistication, it is his experience, his relationship with sound,<br/>not the physical properties of sound as such, which constitute his<br/>materials.  Experience, and only experience, has always been his<br/>point of departure, and while it has often led him to results which<br/>find apparent confirmation in the non-human world, this is by no<br/>means always the case.  Even when it is the case, it can be regarded<br/>as no more than an interesting coincidence until a clear connection<br/>with musical experience can be demonstrated.&quot;</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 2:20:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: jpehrson2 &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, January 11, 2002 12:54 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Roger Sessions on the overtone series<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (from_The Music Experience of Composer, Performer, Listener, 1950)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A great deal of musical theory has been formulated by attempting to<br/>&gt; codify laws governing musical sound and musical rhythm, and from<br/>&gt; these to deduce musical principles.
