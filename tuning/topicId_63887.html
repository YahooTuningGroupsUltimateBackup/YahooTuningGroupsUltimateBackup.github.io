First, and hope all the Partch fans have their sense of humor intact, to use Partch&apos;s music as an indicator of how people hear microtones may be a bit risky, since, to use my St. Louis street terminology, a lot of his stuff is pretty weird ass shit, don&apos;t you think? And, a lot of what I&apos;ve heard over the years would be pretty far removed from what many people would have been exposed to, musically, for the most part. Thus, the tuning aspects may well get mixed in with the strangeness of the music itself, and color how people respond. And, I&apos;m not much on studies, either, I&apos;m more interested in how folks respond in real situations, for the most part.<br/>  And, since I have 5 CD&apos;s  out with micro music on them, and have done many microtonal gigs in various situations, I&apos;ve had some interesting comments over the years. For example, on &quot;If The Earth Was a Woman,&quot; my 4th disc, all the tunes but one are either 19, 34, or fretless. Yet, a guy said to me after he heard it, &quot;I wish you had used your microtonal guitars on this CD.&quot; He didn&apos;t even realize what he was hearing, that was a lesson for sure. Also, I used to play a church gig for a small Hispanic service, we would do Mexican/Latin folk hymns and such, and we had a little choir of maybe 6-7 people (who were not really good singers). One day my 12 tone guitar was at someone&apos;s house, and I had to get to the gig, so I brough my 19 tone acoustic, didn&apos;t tell anybody, and played the usual tunes. Everybody sang the same as always, and nobody said a word, or gave me any funny looks...and, the tunes sounded, for the most part, exactly the same. That was fascinating to me. If anybody suspected anything, they didn&apos;t let me know. I&apos;ve also played ordinary blues bars, did a set of 19 tone rock/blues, and folks danced as usual, didn&apos;t seem to notice anything unusual.<br/>  On the other hand, I lost a gig at a blue collar bar cause we played my OUT 19 tone stuff, and freaked folks way out...but, was it the tuning, or the heaviness and originality of the music? I suspect the music was more responsible in this case. Of course, I imagine there&apos;s many many possible circumstances involved with how people may or may not hear non 12 music, and I really do think a lot of it rests on just how accessible the music is in the first place. And, as a final anecdote (sense of humor again, please), a local DJ, who plays occasional microtonal stuff on his show, chose the one 12 tone piece to play from &quot;If the Earth Was a Woman&quot; as a microtonal selection...how about that? On that disc, I decided not to label the tunes, and make people use their ears only...interesting....best   HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=63888 href="#63888">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2006 12:40:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    And, since I have 5 CD&apos;s  out with micro music on them, and have<br/>done<br/>&gt; many microtonal gigs in various situations, I&apos;ve had some interesting<br/>&gt; comments over the years.

In particular, if the septimal<br/>harmonic movement is involved in an essential way, with chord<br/>relationships involving shared 7/6, 7/5, or 7/4 intervals prominant.</p></div><h3><a id=63890 href="#63890">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2006 1:34:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Neil,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, and hope all the Partch fans have their sense of humor<br/>&gt; intact...</p><p>Quite frequently, nothing makes me laugh more than the tuning list!

But it really brings up a<br/>point, the ties directly in to your post over on MMM about the end<br/>result of where the microtones are leading to:</p><p>1. are you listening to pitches or<br/>2. are you listening to music?</p><p>I&apos;m NOT saying that to be inflamatory in the least bit. There is, and<br/>always will be, music and/or pieces that start life and end life as a<br/>place to showcase non-12 resources. I don&apos;t have any problem with that<br/>at all. But, as you say, Partch isn&apos;t a good subject for either:</p><p>1. straight listening for microtonality<br/>2. unadventurous (content-wise) listeners</p><p>When one listens to music by Partch (and, of course, that covers a lot<br/>of ground), you aren&apos;t probably going to like it - microtones or not!<br/>- if you don&apos;t like other adventurous music. What I observed, over the<br/>duration of 15+ years of performing it live, was that audiences were<br/>won over by the content, and didn&apos;t sit around saying &quot;it is out of<br/>tune&quot;. In fact, what I, and others in the ensemble, found was that of<br/>all the elements of his compositions, the intonational area was<br/>probably the least important in the overall impact. Yes, the<br/>microtones are there, and yes, the music - as he conceived and wrote<br/>it - couldn&apos;t be done without them. But the microtonal fabric of his<br/>language is so much a part of the content he wanted to create that it<br/>doesn&apos;t come across as a separate entity, where one would want to hear<br/>the same piece but played on a piano or something.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m quite un-eloquent this afternoon.</p><p>Weird-ass? I hope so, though he would probably call it an entirely<br/>different serving of tapioca. :) I just finished transferring some of<br/>the master tapes of Partch talking about some of these elements for a<br/>final release on the Innova series, and there is a great quote on<br/>microtonality I&apos;ll have to digitize and post somewhere. Soon, I hope...</p><p>Content is king.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=63891 href="#63891">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2006 1:48:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; First, and hope all the Partch fans have their sense of humor<br/>&gt; intact, to use Partch&apos;s music as an indicator of how people hear<br/>&gt; microtones may be a bit risky, since, to use my St. Louis street<br/>&gt; terminology, a lot of his stuff is pretty weird ass shit, don&apos;t<br/>&gt; you think?

Humans are so variable!</p><p>My final observation is about hearing, and it&apos;s in the<br/>realm of constructive criticism.  It is not an attack<br/>or a put-down:  My ear hears that album title of yours<br/>not musically, but grammatically, as &quot;If The Earth<br/>Were A Woman&quot;.  &quot;Was&quot; is the past tense, is it not, as<br/>in &quot;If the earth was a woman to people ten thousand<br/>years ago, what is she today?&quot;, or am I just &quot;over<br/>educated&quot;?</p><p>As they say in Denmark, Have it Good!</p><p>                  -- Mark Rankin</p><p>--- Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:microstick@msn.com">microstick@msn.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    I know this has been on the list for a bit, but I<br/>&gt; want to make a couple<br/>&gt; of comments.
