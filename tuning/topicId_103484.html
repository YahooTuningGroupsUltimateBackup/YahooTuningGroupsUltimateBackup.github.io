It&apos;s in 41, not perfect by any means, but if it&apos;s not sufficient the whole business of temperament must be highly suspect (it&apos;s sufficient for me and I take a dim view of approximation).</p><p>1&deg; phrase:<br/>I, +IVH11, IH7, iiH11, V7, I</p><p>2&deg; phrase:<br/>IH7, II9, V</p><p>3&deg; phrase: blah blah (ivH9 out to IV)</p><p>The +IVH11 is tuned downwards, retaining the pitch of Do (C) as the 11th. I have doubts if considering this an enharmonic equivalence is really proper: it just is what it is. The iiH11 to my ears blends so much with the V7 that the whole thing is a tall dominant.</p><p>The distinction between iiH11 and the II9 in the next phrase is significantly more marked than the alteration of the third- to my ears it is clearly V/V so intoned, i.e. Re (D here) meaningfully changes according to whether there is a 5-limit structure above it or a 7 or 11-limit structure above it.</p><p>It took 20 irregularly spaced intervals to do these simple things.</p></div>
