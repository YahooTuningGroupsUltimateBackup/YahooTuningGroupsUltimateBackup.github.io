For instance, a C dominant seventh chord &quot;C7&quot; could be<br/>written &quot;1/1-O7&quot; for tonic otonal 7-limit (assuming of course the key of C).<br/>Something like this would be very helpful both in &quot;translating&quot; existing<br/>works into JI and composing improvizational JI music. Here&apos;s an explanation<br/>of my notation I&apos;ve been using for a while, but that I&apos;d be happy to change<br/>if I found a preexisting one.</p><p>The root of the chord is stated as a ratio relatice to the &quot;key&quot; or<br/>fundamental, followed by a dash and a letter &quot;O&quot; or &quot;U&quot; for otonal or<br/>utonal, followed by the odd limit of the chord. If an identity is missing it<br/>is written after it with a slash through it, eg. &quot;1/1-O7 /3&quot; for that<br/>dominant seventh without a fifth. If, on the other hand, an identity is<br/>present that is much greater that the limit of the rest of the chord, it is<br/>written in parenthesis, eg. &quot;1/1-O5 (15)&quot; for a major seventh chord. These<br/>procedures can be repeated and combined to yield things like &quot;1/1-O5 /3<br/>(25)&quot; for an augmented &quot;stack of thirds&quot;, &quot;1/1-O7 /1&quot; for a 5:6:7<br/>diminished, and &quot;1/1-O7 /5 (21)&quot; for an interesting chord I dicovered the<br/>other day (try it!).</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan P.</p><p>P.S. That utonal&gt;otonal cadence commented on in &quot;What am I listening to??<br/>[huh??]&quot; would be &quot;9/8-U9&gt;1/1-O9&quot;, and is a very powerful cadence indeed,<br/>with separations of 36/35 on the critical identities of 5 and 7 (9/7&gt;5/4 and<br/>9/5&gt;7/4).</p></div>
