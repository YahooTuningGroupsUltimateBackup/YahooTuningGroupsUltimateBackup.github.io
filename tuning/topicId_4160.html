Erlich &#x3C;PErlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/1999 1:58:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I appreciate all the kind words (Dan especially) but I feel the recent<br/>conflicts show that I should &quot;chill out&quot; on the list for a while.</p><p>Anyway, over the several years this list was on the Mills server, and the<br/>several months on the Onelist server, many, many questions were asked by<br/>&quot;beginners&quot;, and some of these questions were asked &quot;frequently&quot;. For<br/>example, Darin Arrick just asked,</p><p>&gt;First, what tuning would be best for someone who is interested<br/>&gt;in playing around? 22TET? 24TET (easy to refret!)? 19TET? 31TET?<br/>&gt;Some sort of JI? 19 fret LucyTuning? Something else?</p><p>I (and others) explained on many occasions (and love doing so) how 19-tET<br/>and 31-tET allow for conventional diatonic thinking and notation, while<br/>22-tET does not. 22-tET and especially 31-tET allow one to approximate<br/>chords that involve harmonics (or subharmonics) through the 7th and, with<br/>less accuracy, all the way through the 11th. I recommend ETs over non-ETs on<br/>the guitar because (for one thing) in ETs the frets go straight across,<br/>allowing string bending as usual. But Jon Catler has done great work with<br/>both wildly-staggered-JI-fretted and fretless guitar. Darin, I too am a big<br/>Yes fan (just finished reading the new Chris Welch book) but, despite Yes&apos;s<br/>diatonic orientation, I play a 22-tET guitar, which I had John Starrett fret<br/>for me because of the ideas in my paper:<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>.</p><p>What should ideally be done is, someone should go through all the years of<br/>archives, compile the questions in order of frequency, and come up with a<br/>consensus summary of the answers.</p><p>I would love to undertake such a project but don&apos;t have the time. I<br/>contribute to the List during my free time at work. Away from work, I play<br/>guitar. When not performing, I spend hours a day keeping my chops up and<br/>developing my style. 99% of the time, sorry to say, it&apos;s on plain old<br/>12-tone guitar. Ultimately, I want to spend more time on microtonality;<br/>hopefully that will involve both performing and writing a book that will go<br/>from beginning through advanced material.</p><p>For now, perhaps Graham Breed&apos;s page provides the best introduction to<br/>tuning, temperament, lattices, etc. that covers the &quot;advanced&quot; material<br/>without any prerequisites. It&apos;s too bad Graham has dropped the link to my<br/>22-tET paper from his page :(</p><p>I would like to respond to a few more things from the latest digest before I<br/>lay low for a while --</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote,</p><p>&gt; Joe!<br/>&gt;     My point which I will not let up on, is to speak the language of your<br/>&gt; peers and or your audience. If Wilson can manage to convey his ideas with<br/>&gt; such simple language I can&apos;t understand why the rest of you can&apos;t!</p><p>I think Joe Monzo and others who have told me so will agree that Erv Wilson<br/>is one of the most unforgiving theorists ever to delve into microtonality.<br/>His writing is so dense, and his thought process so concealed, that one<br/>could easily write a book trying to explain a single Wilson article to a<br/>beginner. While academic journal articles tend to proceed logically, point<br/>by point, Wilson&apos;s style is unbelievably abstruse. What I love about him is<br/>that he often has more to say in a single diagram than ten articles can say<br/>in a hundred pages of text!</p><p>David Bearsley wrote,</p><p>&gt;Generally I try to practice with a sine drone . . .<br/>&gt;One of the lower harmonics I have problems<br/>&gt;finding is 13.</p><p>A sine drone has no harmonics, therefore it is not surprising that you have<br/>problems finding them! Any repeating waveform other than a sine wave would<br/>be a better choice.</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote (concerning the two main scales in my 22-tET paper):</p><p>&gt;Paul, do you think your preference for the<br/>&gt;pentachordal decatonics can be explained by the lower efficiency of the<br/>&gt;symmetric ones?</p><p>Maybe -- the symmetry of the latter makes it impossible to decide between<br/>one tonic and other a half-octave away; that may be a disturbing feature<br/>which makes me unconfortable. But I&apos;m convinced that the fact that the other<br/>scale &quot;breaks the symmetry&quot; at the perfect fifth and not at some other<br/>interval is significant in making it aurally pleasing.</p><p>Daniel Wolf wrote,</p><p>&gt;I still don&apos;t follow why<br/>&gt;Paul Erlich needs to use entropy</p><p>At first, I just used the likelihood of the most likely interpretation. But<br/>then I realized that, given a likelihood of the most likely interpretation,<br/>the consonance would be lower if the second-most likely interpretation were<br/>high, and higher if it were low. And so on ad infinitum. The entropy is a<br/>natural function of the set of likelihoods that measures the degree of<br/>randomness or &quot;noisiness&quot; and theoretically the expected length of a code<br/>that could communicate what is being heard. The result is a model of<br/>intervallic dissonance based on the virtual pitch phenomenon and is<br/>timbre-independent for harmonic timbres, as opposed to the<br/>Plomp-Levelt-Sethares model which is based on the critical-band rougness<br/>phenomenon and is highly timbre-dependent.</p><p>Finally, I&apos;m glad the consensus is not to split the list. Tuning is an<br/>inherently mathematical subject and we all should approach it with a<br/>willingness and curiosity to learn more mathematics.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t look like I&apos;m doing a good job of chilling out. But I think it&apos;s<br/>only fair that I join Dave Keenan and Patrick Pagano and take a break for a<br/>while. Please feel free to e-mail me privately on any of these subjects.</p></div><h3><a id=4162 href="#4162">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/1999 2:48:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul H.

The body is steel, not a particularly<br/>resonant material in this instance.
