<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>desire for meantone with an 11-limit interval on piano</h1><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2006 1:06:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, All,</p><p>I&apos;m thinking of putting a new tuning on my piano, which would be something<br/>vaguely near a quarter-comma meantone with the wolf between Bb and F instead<br/>of the usual G# to Eb.  This has the interesting quality of making the key<br/>of C very consonant both otonally and utonally(somewhat).  Specifically you<br/>get the near-pure 6:7 on C-Eb and G-Bb, which gives you the near-pure<br/>subminor-seventh in C, besides giving you the pure 4:5:6:7 in C (and also in<br/>F).</p><p>So if that were the only goal, I&apos;d probably temper it for a good compromise<br/>among the near-pure 2:3, 4:5, and 6:7, perhaps with the best beat ratios.</p><p>However, I want to make one more tweak to this scale, which is to flatten<br/>the F# to make it form a near-pure 8:11 with C.  I might (depending on how<br/>the rest of the tuning works) do this only in the upper octaves, leaving<br/>good D-F# thirds in the lower octaves.  But still I&apos;d like to tweak the<br/>whole temperament to make the best of this.</p><p>A primary goal would be to have good audible implied fundamentals hanging<br/>around the 4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11 chords and subsets thereof.  This usually<br/>requires the intervals involved to be within something like 7 cents of pure,<br/>(maybe closer in case of the intervals involving 11?).  But I&apos;m wondering<br/>how far I can stretch this 7-cent limit in order to achieve even other<br/>purposes with the temperament.  So I was wondering:  suppose for example the<br/>7:11 is within 7 cents, and the 4:7 is within 7 cents but the 4:11 is not?<br/>This is just for example, there may be some better way to structure the<br/>compromise, depending on what else could be achieved.  I&apos;m wondering if<br/>people have had any experience with how this works particularly with piano<br/>tone and inharmonicity, and if anyone has found any good near-meantone<br/>tunings with 2 good 6:7&apos;s and a good ...:7:...:11.</p><p>Then with regard to piano, I&apos;m wondering as usual about the octaves.  My<br/>piano tuner tells me not to compromise the octaves too much because you<br/>basically want to stretch to achieve a certain overall resonance with the<br/>octaves.  So narrowing the octaves ends up being bad for the overall sound.</p><p>Then with regard to other things that could be achieved with the tuning, the<br/>main question is, once I mess with that F# to give it 11-limit utility in C,<br/>what else could I do with it at the same time?  For example, if I flattened<br/>the F# a little less and flattened the Eb a little more then I might get<br/>another decent subminor triad at Eb-F#-Bb (excuse my bad enharmonic notation<br/>habits).  I think that&apos;s really pushing it, but it seems conceivable that<br/>there might be something interesting in this &quot;vicinity&quot;, something with<br/>perhaps some useful circulating key-color qualities that somehow integrates<br/>the 11-limite F# and the 7-limit Eb and Bb into some kind of a temperament<br/>that has some kind of meantone roudness to it.  And although I mentioned<br/>quarter-comma as a kind of starting point, I&apos;d probably rather have<br/>something that has a bit more variation in the intervals rather than having<br/>most of the major 3rds being the same.</p><p>Problem is that getting the piano retunred to try something like this is a<br/>lot of trouble, so I&apos;m looking for some perhaps piano-specific advice in<br/>advance.  However, any non-piano-oriented advice in relation to a meantonish<br/>scale with an 11-limit otonal feature would be great.  Having the implied<br/>fundamental &quot;thing&quot; happening but perhaps happening right at the edge of<br/>perceptual possibility might be interesting, especially if this permits more<br/>flexibility in the overall temperament.</p><p>If there can be any kind of integration of the 11-limit F#, then I&apos;d<br/>probably use it across the whole keyboard instead of just the upper end, as<br/>I originally suggested.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any thoughts.  I&apos;m probably asking for too much from a<br/>12-tone octave, sort of an impossible holy grail, but it is worth a try.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2006 5:52:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/13/06, Kurt Bigler &lt;<a href="mailto:kkb@breathsense.com">kkb@breathsense.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>[...]<br/>&gt; However, I want to make one more tweak to this scale, which is to flatten<br/>&gt; the F# to make it form a near-pure 8:11 with C.

(just my two cents)</p><p>Yes, probably it ends up being untraditional usage I&apos;m going for, but still<br/>somewhat influenced by traditional usages.  So that means either improv or<br/>severe adaptation.  But I&apos;m just looking for a road somewhere between a<br/>quasi-meantone that I have on the piano and the dual-harmonic (modified)<br/>that I have on the harpsichord:</p><p>    <a href="http://k.breathsense.com/music/">http://k.breathsense.com/music/</a></p><p>So I&apos;ve been in the severely-limited boat of the dual-harmonic, and the<br/>totally-open-to-classical/romantic quasi-meantone, and I want something<br/>in-between.  With meantone as a reference, I want a more usable 7-limit, and<br/>I&apos;m just asking the question whether I can squeeze the single 11-limit into<br/>the picture.  I think I can, even for limited classically-informed<br/>improvisation, based on my limited experience with the modified<br/>quarter-comma that I tuned up on the harpsichord a couple days ago.  I can<br/>still play a little Bach on it, for example.  The availability of the<br/>7-limit is sweet and something I&apos;ve been dying for in a context that has<br/>traditional western stuff still somewhat within reach.  The 11-limit is<br/>admittedly a question-mark, and its presence clearly destroys any normal key<br/>progression and requires a fair amount of what will seem like avoidance at<br/>first.  But it will seem like total freedom compared to having a total of 4<br/>11- and 13-limit notes in the octave.</p><p>I&apos;ll probably try it, record some improvs and report back with them.</p><p>It looks like 13/60 (syntonic) comma meantone makes C-Eb and Eb-F# (the 11/8<br/>F# so to speak) both 8.8 cents wide of pure 7/6, putting 3 subminor triads<br/>and some interesting diminished chords within the realm.  So I have to put<br/>that on the organ/synth and hear whether it works (whether 8.8 cents error<br/>is too much).  If so then I need to somehow equal-beat-ify the thing,<br/>something I&apos;m not yet experienced with.  But I want to take the equality out<br/>of the equal intervals and get more different intervals sizes, and<br/>equal-beating seems to be a good way to do that.</p><p>Thanks, I&apos;ll keep you posted.</p><p>Yes 12-notes is a bear.  Dying for that affordable 2-d keyboard.  The wait<br/>is grueling with the expectations seeded for what seems like so many years<br/>now.

Or alternately it<br/>is a way of finding 7-limit utility in a 5-limit structure.  But I guess you<br/>have to say you are tempering out a comma, not a prime, and I suppose most<br/>usage on this list has been pretty clear about that.  It gets even more<br/>obvious with 441/440 which (in the language I&apos;ve just been using) relates<br/>primes 3,7 to primes 5,11 (ignoring 2 again).  Clearly in that case there is<br/>no single prime that can be made to disappear.  Rather pairs of primes fold<br/>onto other pairs of primes.</p><p>So would you call 2401/2400 (7*7*7*7/(2*2*2*2*2*3*5*5)) a 7-limit comma?</p><p>But when you say &quot;The actual 11-limit project ignores 2, 243/242 and<br/>441/440&quot; and you go about creating a lattice for the result, it seems to me<br/>that would usually be called a 5-limit lattice, isn&apos;t that right?

So in this<br/>case you might want to say that 7 is absent.  This might be true for 24-et<br/>for example.  It is a good 11-limit tuning, but provides no useful 7-limit<br/>capability.  Useful is of course relative, so this may technically require<br/>specifying an error tolerance.  Nonetheless it could be looked at the other<br/>way, I&apos;d think, i.e. a definition of a temperament might specify what<br/>functionality is intended to be used without specifying a tolerance.</p><p>Similarly one might want to specify what limit numbers are considered to be<br/>exact and which are considered to be approximated but useful.  For example<br/>Duodene can be tuned exact in the 5-limit but can be construed to provide<br/>useful 7-limit functioning.
