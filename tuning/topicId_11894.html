I&apos;ve stated before that<br/>&gt; I find 23 to be a kind of limit to harmonic perception in music;<br/>&gt; is there a connection?... and why is 11 conspicuously missing?</p><p>Perhaps only because the rounding is arbitrary?</p><p>&gt; this comparision of orbital<br/>&gt; periods *only of adjacent planets* is similar to Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>&gt; comparison of *dyadic* harmonic entropy among members of a larger<br/>&gt; set (such as a chord or scale).</p><p>Analogous, yes, but are they really similar in any musically relevant way?</p><p>&gt; I sent a private message to Paul suggesting we collaborate on<br/>&gt; creating a piece which is an audible mapping of these planetary<br/>&gt; relationships, to which he never responded (Paul?).

Einstein&apos;s<br/>Theory of Relativity (which so far has been validated time<br/>after time) states that no single point of reference is any more<br/>objective than any other, and that the &apos;speed of light&apos; is the<br/>ultimate speed-limit of our universe.</p><p>(I use quotes because all electromagnetic waves travel at this<br/>speed, and visible light occupies only a small bandwidth of the<br/>total spectrum; it would be more accurate to call it the<br/>&apos;speed of electromagnetic radiation&apos;.  &apos;Light&apos; is just a<br/>simplified abbrieviation here and in what follows below.)</p><p>When we observe vast distances from Earth, peering deep into the<br/>universe, by any type of electromagnetic means (i.e., not just<br/>visible light, but other radio waves too), we are looking back<br/>not only in distance but also in time.  Here&apos;s a diagram:</p><p>&gt; [Ferris 1982, p 171]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     |       - _                         .<br/>&gt;    /|\          - _                     .<br/>&gt;     |               - _                 .  realm of the future<br/>&gt;     |                   - _             .<br/>&gt;     |     realm of the      - _         .<br/>&gt;   S |    knowable past          - _     .<br/>&gt;   P |                               - _ .<br/>&gt;   A | TIME----&gt;                       _ X = our galaxy at our<br/>&gt;   C |                             _ -   .    present<br/>&gt;   E |                         _ -       .<br/>&gt;     |                     _ -           .<br/>&gt;     |                 _ -   realm of    .<br/>&gt;     |             _ -    the as yet     .<br/>&gt;    \|/        _ -   unknowable future   .<br/>&gt;     |     _ -                           .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At any given point in cosmic history, the events that may be<br/>&gt; known to a given observer are limited to those inside his light<br/>&gt; cone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Events occuring elsewhere in the cosmos make themselves known<br/>&gt; to us only when their light (or other radiation) reaches us.<br/>&gt; Therefore, events may be divided into those that lie within our<br/>&gt; &apos;light cone&apos;, that is, events whose light has had time to reach<br/>&gt; us, and those lying outside the light cone, about which we can<br/>&gt; as yet have no knowledge.  Our galaxy may be envisioned as<br/>&gt; moving from left to right in this diagram as time passes, so<br/>&gt; that events are constantly being swept into our light cone.</p><p>And as Ferris&apos;s diagram on the previous page demonstrates,<br/>observers in other galaxies would have different light cones,<br/>which give them a totally different view of the universe,<br/>in terms of both space and time.</p><p>The part that is labelled &apos;realm of the as yet unknowable future&apos;<br/>is only unknowable to *us*.  An observer in a galaxy somewhere else<br/>can see some of this now, while we can see stuff that they can&apos;t.</p><p>The point I was making was that no matter where we are in<br/>the universe, we can only observe a limited segment of it.<br/>The only way to get a broader perspective is to gather data<br/>from a point sufficiently distant from our galaxy that it<br/>would have a very different light cone.  But because of the<br/>incredibly vast distances involved, this is something that<br/>probably won&apos;t be achieved for a very long time to come.</p><p>As you get deeper into a study of light cones, it becomes<br/>apparent that even the distinction between past and future<br/>is not at all clear-cut, because of the intimate relationship<br/>between space and time.</p><p>Because of the &apos;speed of light&apos; speed-limit on our perception,<br/>time seems to be 1-dimensional, whereas space has 3 dimensions.<br/>I suggest that time too may be multi-dimensional, but we&apos;re<br/>still a long way from being able to observe it that way.</p><p>In a nutshell, until we are able to travel to distant galaxies,<br/>(or receive comprehensible information from them) to gain a better<br/>perspective, our &apos;universe&apos; = our light cone.</p><p>Einstein&apos;s equations do a good job of describing what goes<br/>on &apos;in here&apos;, but there is clearly a lot more &apos;out there&apos; that<br/>we can&apos;t see.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Many researchers are coming around to the idea that science<br/>&gt; &gt; can never really describe objects, but only processes.  In a<br/>&gt; &gt; sense, on the cosmological or atomic timescales, the objects<br/>&gt; &gt; never &apos;really&apos; exist, only the laws that describe their<br/>&gt; &gt; movements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No offense, but they&apos;re a little behind.</p><p>No offense taken - while I do believe in the validity of the<br/>scientific method, I ain&apos;t hardly no scientist myself, and am more<br/>than willing to consider the possibility that knowledge can be<br/>gained thru an examination of the occult, mysticism, religion,<br/>etc.</p><p>Something that I think many people fail to take into account is<br/>the incredibly long time-span that humans have been around and<br/>have been intelligent enough to observe their environment and<br/>reason about it.</p><p>The latest reckoning states that language became fully developed<br/>as we know it about 45,000 years ago.  The earliest written<br/>records, by the Sumerians, are from about 5,000 years ago.<br/>Thus our entire written history records only about 1/9 of the<br/>total time that we&apos;ve been able to speak.</p><p>That leaves 40,000 years (or 8/9 of our speaking period...<br/>hmmm... an amusingly musical interval!) during which humans<br/>were certainly (biologically speaking) as intelligent as we are<br/>today, but did not have a way to record their ideas so that we<br/>can read them today.  That&apos;s a *lot* of time, during which people<br/>could observe the stars and planets as well as events closer to<br/>the Earth.</p><p>There&apos;s no reason to assume that more-or-less complex &apos;scientific&apos;<br/>theories could not have been developed during all this time;<br/>we just have no written record of it.  I suspect that a lot of<br/>what one finds in mystic/occult and religious literature stems<br/>from this ancient knowledge.  My study of Sumerian records has<br/>only strengthened this suspicion.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the harmonic relationships inherent<br/>in music really do have some connection with other natural<br/>occurences.  Music is apparently very closely allied with<br/>our ability to speak in thought-conveying sentences, and<br/>both are strictly human activities, at least in the form in<br/>which we practice them (bird and whale songs notwithstanding).</p><p>An interesting side note:  don&apos;t be fooled by current beliefs<br/>that literacy was always considered a &apos;good thing&apos; - the earliest<br/>records show that the invention of writing was mainly a tool<br/>for the collection of taxes and the enslavement of masses of<br/>workers.  For several centuries - I&apos;m even tempted to say<br/>millenia - the scribes were the only people who were literate,<br/>and their specific job was to help the king retain his power<br/>by maintaining his records of taxation and labor.</p><p>&gt; Heraclitus of Ephesus espoused that philosophy in the 6th century<br/>&gt; B. C.  We&apos;re talkin&apos; pre-Platonic, here, pre-Socratic, even<br/>&gt; pre-Pythagorean.  The ancient Greeks were fairly intelligent dudes.</p><p>Yes they were.  And if you study Babylonian and Sumerian writings,<br/>you&apos;ll find that the Greeks got a great deal of their knowledge<br/>from the Babylonians, who in turn took it over wholesale from the<br/>Sumerians.  Now *there* were some intelligent dudes!  The more<br/>scholars are able to decipher of the Sumerian records, the more<br/>amazing it is to see the vast breadth of their knowledge.</p><p>I&apos;m very busy myself right now studying the Sumerian stuff,<br/>but if you keep the possibility open, maybe we can collaborate<br/>on a piece in the future, or even piecemeal via email.  Perhaps<br/>others here on the List who are interested can participate too.</p><p>REFERENCE<br/>---------</p><p>Ferris, Timothy.  1982.  _Galaxies_.<br/>  Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang.
