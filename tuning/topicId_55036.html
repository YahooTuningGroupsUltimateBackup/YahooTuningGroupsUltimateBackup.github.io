I&apos;m beginning to think there must be some kind of<br/>&quot;super-real power&quot; that delivers my ideas to you (and yours to me) even<br/>before they<br/>manage to appear on the list. When you sent the scale the first time, I<br/>realized I didn&apos;t specify the position of the 1/1 and I was a bit wondering<br/>why you took it from -19 to +2 fifths (if I forget about the schisma).<br/>Though, I said to myself: &quot;Well, it&apos;s essentially what it should be like.&quot;<br/>And about a day later, what a surprise, you sent it again just in the same<br/>form as I use it.<br/>It&apos;s all quite an interesting matter. At the time I joined the list, you<br/>discussed some good thoughts about various commas in which I mostly agreed<br/>with you. Then, it was the strongest surprise for me when you spoke about<br/>your idea of using 11/8 and 13/8 in a meantone tuning in just the same way<br/>as I tried some two years ago. There were also other topics like this I<br/>can&apos;t recall now. And, correct me if I&apos;m wrong, I believe in one of your<br/>posts I found a few words mentioning your fondness for 50-equal. I&apos;m getting<br/>ready for everything. If I should discover, for example, that you like music<br/>full of otonal scales, that you&apos;ve also experimented with quasi-meantone<br/>tunings, or perhaps that you&apos;ve examined equal-beating meantones, I don&apos;t<br/>think I need to be surprised. I&apos;m rather curious what&apos;s gonna be the next<br/>topic on the list we both think of almost at the same time.<br/>Petr<br/>PS: Do you think someone ever used a meantone tuning with a minor second of<br/>15/14? I recently made some music this way and now I&apos;m trying to find out if<br/>I was or wasn&apos;t the first.</p></div><h3><a id=55040 href="#55040">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2004 2:07:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I found an interesting property of this scale.

It seems just about right so far as the sound goes,<br/>it has a 12-note scale wolf pretty close to 20/13 and major thirds in<br/>the extreme keys nearly 9/7.
