And the series<br/>of powers of 2 and 3, aside from perfect coincidence at unity, do not<br/>come any closer than the 19th power of 2 and the 12th power of 3. So<br/>the 18th power of 2 and the 12th power of 3 are very nearly an octave<br/>apart. Here the mysterious beauty deepens because although 18 and 12<br/>are the respective exponents of 2 and 3, 18 = 2 x 3^2 and 12 = 2^2 x<br/>3. So this &apos;octave&apos; spans 2^(2 x 3^2) and 3^(2^2 x 3). Anyone could<br/>be forgiven for thinking that this is &quot;all twos and threes&quot;.

I did not name<br/>&gt; &gt; the &apos;series of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; natural numbers&apos; nonetheless that is what it is called. It<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is &apos;natural&apos; for water to seek a level. It is &apos;natural&apos; for<br/>&gt; &gt; entropy<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to increase. These are things that just simply happen<br/>&gt; &gt; in &apos;nature&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are wrong to impute false meanings to my words. The rest of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what you said here can safely be ignored.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Natural numbers are either postive integers, or non-negative<br/>&gt; &gt; integers,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; depending on the source and the context.  There is nothing<br/>&gt; &gt; special about 12<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; here.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, I&apos;ll bite.  You are apparently thinking *something*.  So<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe its time<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for a guessing game.  12 is a very nice number yes.  It probably<br/>&gt; &gt; divides by<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; more things evenly than any other number before it, while not<br/>&gt; &gt; having gotten<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; too large yet.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Am I getting warmer?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -Kurt<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Peter,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; To further clarify.  Lest you take my comments above to be<br/>&gt; &gt; facetious, I was<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; looking for an intuitive way into the question of what you are<br/>&gt; &gt; talking<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; about, so the &quot;getting warmer&quot; approach I was hoping might work<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; a way of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; getting us into the ballpark.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; It appears to me that you have made a conjecture, that you are<br/>sure<br/>&gt; &gt; of it,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and it seems clear that most of the participating community here<br/>&gt; &gt; considers<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; it to be an undemonstrated conjecture.  In that position I think<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; responsibility still lies with you to clarify your conjecture,<br/>&gt; &gt; rather than<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; continuing to refer to it with no further clarification.  Your<br/>&gt; &gt; approach so<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; far has not worked to elucidate anything to us so it would appear<br/>&gt; &gt; that you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; have some underlying assumption or reference that is entirely<br/>&gt; &gt; unfamiliar to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the rest of us in spite of being somehow obvious to you.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, I hear the words &quot;The rest of what you said here can<br/>&gt; &gt; safely be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ignored&quot; as dismissive, and I understand being dismissive as a<br/>mild<br/>&gt; &gt; form of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; agression.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Kurt<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You are getting increasingly paranoid and risk losing the respect<br/>&gt; &gt; that you had previously earned from me. It was *you* who accused<br/>me<br/>&gt; &gt; of equivocation, putting words into my mouth that I had not<br/>spoken.<br/>&gt; &gt; If you choose to ignore the explanations that I have presented to<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; rather than deal with them that does not make me wrong - it makes<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; an ass. Again I will point you to<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.odeion.org/atlantis/chapter-1.html">http://www.odeion.org/atlantis/chapter-1.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My apologies.  I had forgotten about this, had not read it at the<br/>time, and<br/>&gt; then completely misplaced its very existence.  It looks like in<br/>this case I<br/>&gt; was making more trouble for everyone, since even others had read<br/>this.  So I<br/>&gt; was speaking out of an unnecessary confusion.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Apology accepted. You have shot back up the respect scale and have<br/>rung the bell at the top. Your prize is my apology for being a<br/>cantankerous old fool. Hopefully I will mellow out and become more<br/>like you. We are all fighting over Helen of Troy when we should be<br/>throwing her to the army.</p><p>&gt; It is a good lesson for me, and appropriate that it should come at<br/>this<br/>&gt; time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you can find any fault in that with regard to the generation of<br/>&gt; &gt; dodekaphony I would be pleased to hear about it. Otherwise you are<br/>&gt; &gt; just playing the game of being deliberately obtuse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No not that I hope.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At some point you<br/>&gt; &gt; will become what you pretend to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, may I pretend well then.  And I trust that your admonition<br/>about liars<br/>&gt; is a warning and not yet an accusation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Kurt<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is the fate of all liars to<br/>&gt; &gt; lose the distinction between lies and truth and to get caught out<br/>by<br/>&gt; &gt; an even bigger liar than themselves. You should beware of falling<br/>&gt; &gt; into that trap because I don&apos;t think there is any way out of it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Peter<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is consistent with what it is to &quot;ignore&quot; someone.  You may<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; not have meant that, and my take on the connotation may seem<br/>absurd<br/>&gt; &gt; to you.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact perhaps some of my frustration and anger leaked into my<br/>&gt; &gt; message to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; which you responded, and I would have been better to acknowledge<br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; frustration up front.  So perhaps I started it by my<br/>indirectness.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; But for now I don&apos;t know of a way to avoid the fact that you are<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; minority, and that by convention the responsibility lies with<br/>you to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; demonstrate your point about how the word &quot;natural&quot; has a<br/>particular<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; relation to the number &quot;12&quot;.  Anything further references to it<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; your part<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; without further clarification are fruitless, as I see it.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; So let me ask another question to try to help the process.

What I would like to know is - how<br/>&gt;close do the two series have to come for the ratio to be considered a<br/>&gt;node? What criterion can be applied to that?</p><p>It seems natural to look for successive improvements, where each<br/>node must be at a closer coincidence than the last.  Another option<br/>is to &apos;penalize&apos; by the number of tones in the system, and one could<br/>in principle make a penalty so stiff that only 12 seems acceptable...<br/>but since composers who&apos;ve tried larger systems seem to have such<br/>great results (to my ear), I cannot conceive of musical justification<br/>for such a stiff penalty.</p><p>&gt;Is it purely subjective or is there some physical law at the root of<br/>&gt;it? I&apos;m not sure a 41-fret guitar would be playable, nor a 41<br/>&gt;keys/8ve clavier, so perhaps it&apos;s just a practical consideration.</p><p>There have been 41-tone clavier designs put forth, and I never<br/>cease to be amazed at what musicians can do.  That said, as a<br/>clavier player myself I intend to focus on 31 tones and fewer.</p><p>A pipe organ with 31 tones have been proven playable by Fokker<br/>and the Dutch 31-toners.  A harpsichord with 29 tones has been<br/>proven playable by Norman Henry.</p><p>Try this link...</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/instrum.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/instrum.html</a></p><p>Now this...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/norman_henry.jpg">http://lumma.org/tuning/norman_henry.jpg</a></p><p>And this will give you an idea of how the notes can be laid<br/>out on one of these babies...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/carlos_keyboard.jpg">http://lumma.org/tuning/carlos_keyboard.jpg</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; I would expect improvements in both &apos;per 3&apos; and absolute differences<br/>&gt;&gt; to continue as the series goes to infinity, and I&apos;m suspect Gene<br/>&gt;&gt; could rattle out a proof of that in a few minutes.  If I didn&apos;t have<br/>&gt;&gt; to meet a friend now, I&apos;d start by making an analogy with Euclid&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; proof that there are infinitely many primes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So we should divide the octave into an infinite number of intervals.<br/>&gt;At least white noise does not contain any detectable discords.

It is almost<br/>impossible for us to judge this impartially because we have all been<br/>exposed to 12-ET from an early age.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Natural&quot; needs to be defined as to what is meant by the word,<br/>&gt; and what qualifies a music system as &quot;natural.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter, it&apos;d be great for you to attempt to disprove the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; claim for other tunings like 19-tet, or heptatonic or pentatonic<br/>&gt; scales etc.  There is a gigantic amount of information available<br/>&gt; online about all these different tuning issues.  If you actually<br/>have<br/>&gt; evidence that some scales don&apos;t work quite as people have<br/>&gt; claimed, it would be a great help to everyone for you to make<br/>&gt; such evidence available.  But evidence of the significance of<br/>&gt; 12-tone is simply not evidence *against* other tunings...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, maybe I missed it, but is there somewhere that you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; described the actual method used in odien for selecting related<br/>&gt; notes?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The method is what I call the &apos;Rule of the Natural Aesthetic&apos;,<br/>or &apos;Path of Natural Intervals&apos;. It may well be equally applicable to<br/>other pitch sets such as 41-JI and 53-JI. I have yet to perform a<br/>full numerical analysis of these alternate systems to discover the<br/>extent to which they too possess a large number of &apos;correlative<br/>intervals&apos;. The easiest way to understand correlative intervals is to<br/>download my Natural Dodekaphonic Interval Correlator (for Windows<br/>only I am afraid). You can download the installer from:-<br/><a href="http://www.odeion.org/atlantis/natural2.html">http://www.odeion.org/atlantis/natural2.html</a><br/>This program comes with extensive Help.</p><p>The Rule of the Natural Aesthetic depends on the presence of<br/>correlative intervals within a scale. Briefly, a correlative interval<br/>is one between any two pitches, neither of which is the tonic, which<br/>is numerically interval to an interval of the defining set. The<br/>defining set is that specified from the tonic. In ET all intervals<br/>are correlative, so this system only works using JI intervals. A<br/>melody or chord which follows this rule only combines notes whose<br/>relative interval is correlative. All other melodic motion of chord<br/>structures are forbidden.</p><p>It has been pointed out to me that I enforce &apos;inversion symmetry&apos; in<br/>my system and I am planning to allow that to be switchable and will<br/>let everyone know when a new version of the Correlator is available.<br/>I will also make the program extendable to the higher analogs such as<br/>JI-41 and JI-53. We will then see if they are more or less &apos;natural&apos;<br/>than 12-JI. Using the definitive set<br/>1:1<br/>15:16<br/>8:9<br/>5:6<br/>4:5<br/>3:4<br/>45:64 &amp; 32:45 (i.e. dim5th and aug4th in place of a single tritone)<br/>2:3<br/>5:8<br/>3:5<br/>9:16<br/>8:15<br/>1:2<br/>gives rise to 44 correlative intervals, from a total of 66 relative<br/>intervals. So 2/3 exactly of the intervals are correlative. An<br/>example of a correlative interval is that between pitch 3 and pitch<br/>8, interval class 5 which evaluates to 3:4 which is a definitive<br/>interval as listed above. An example of an irrelative (i.e. non-<br/>correlative) interval is that between pitch 3 and pitch 10. This is<br/>interval class 7 and evaluates to 27:40, which is absent from the set<br/>of definitive intervals. Thus, following the Rule, no melodic motion<br/>can ever take place in either direction between pitches 3 and 10 and<br/>no chord can contain both notes. In ODEION I extend this to include<br/>alternate as well as immediate melodic relations such that, for any<br/>given note of a melody, the preceding note must relate to the<br/>following note in like manner.</p><p>If this system turns out also to work with JI-41 or JI-53 etc. then<br/>we have a general case.

It even has a some decent septimal<br/>intervals and chords, belonging to septimal schismic with comma basis<br/>225/224 and 3125/3087.</p></div><h3><a id=49948 href="#49948">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2003 2:32:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;sault@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Rule of the Natural Aesthetic depends on the presence of<br/>&gt; &gt; correlative intervals within a scale. Briefly, a correlative<br/>interval<br/>&gt; &gt; is one between any two pitches, neither of which is the tonic,<br/>&gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; is numerically interval to an interval of the defining set. The<br/>&gt; &gt; defining set is that specified from the tonic. In ET all<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; are correlative, so this system only works using JI intervals. A<br/>&gt; &gt; melody or chord which follows this rule only combines notes<br/>&gt; whose<br/>&gt; &gt; relative interval is correlative. All other melodic motion of<br/>chord<br/>&gt; &gt; structures are forbidden.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It has been pointed out to me that I enforce &apos;inversion<br/>&gt; symmetry&apos; in<br/>&gt; &gt; my system and I am planning to allow that to be switchable<br/>&gt; and will<br/>&gt; &gt; let everyone know when a new version of the Correlator is<br/>&gt; available.<br/>&gt; &gt; I will also make the program extendable to the higher analogs<br/>&gt; such as<br/>&gt; &gt; JI-41 and JI-53. We will then see if they are more or less<br/>&gt; &apos;natural&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; than 12-JI. Using the definitive set<br/>&gt; &gt; 1:1<br/>&gt; &gt; 15:16<br/>&gt; &gt; 8:9<br/>&gt; &gt; 5:6<br/>&gt; &gt; 4:5<br/>&gt; &gt; 3:4<br/>&gt; &gt; 45:64 &amp; 32:45 (i.e. dim5th and aug4th in place of a single<br/>&gt; tritone)<br/>&gt; &gt; 2:3<br/>&gt; &gt; 5:8<br/>&gt; &gt; 3:5<br/>&gt; &gt; 9:16<br/>&gt; &gt; 8:15<br/>&gt; &gt; 1:2<br/>&gt; &gt; gives rise to 44 correlative intervals, from a total of 66<br/>relative<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals. So 2/3 exactly of the intervals are correlative. An<br/>&gt; &gt; example of a correlative interval is that between pitch 3 and<br/>&gt; pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; 8, interval class 5 which evaluates to 3:4 which is a definitive<br/>&gt; &gt; interval as listed above. An example of an irrelative (i.e. non-<br/>&gt; &gt; correlative) interval is that between pitch 3 and pitch 10. This<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; interval class 7 and evaluates to 27:40, which is absent from<br/>&gt; the set<br/>&gt; &gt; of definitive intervals. Thus, following the Rule, no melodic<br/>&gt; motion<br/>&gt; &gt; can ever take place in either direction between pitches 3 and<br/>&gt; 10 and<br/>&gt; &gt; no chord can contain both notes. In ODEION I extend this to<br/>&gt; include<br/>&gt; &gt; alternate as well as immediate melodic relations such that, for<br/>&gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; given note of a melody, the preceding note must relate to the<br/>&gt; &gt; following note in like manner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter, first, unfortunately I have a Mac and can&apos;t use your<br/>&gt; program.  Anyway, I think I am understanding, but let me ask a<br/>&gt; question to clarify...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By stating correlative as &quot;numerically interval to an interval of<br/>the<br/>&gt; defining set&quot; do you mean only those intervals such as exist in<br/>&gt; the set from tonic?<br/>&gt; I must be missing something, because it would seem from what<br/>&gt; I am reading that you could not move from the second scale<br/>&gt; degree (pitch 9/8 in the scale) to the third degree (pitch 5/4)<br/>&gt; because the interval of 9:10 is not in the defining set.  Is this<br/>&gt; correct??  That movement is a pretty common and basic<br/>&gt; movement in a lot of music, from what I understand...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron</p><p>Hi Aaron</p><p>Your understanding is correct on both points. The exclusion of that<br/>step (II to III) remains even if the defining interval itself is<br/>changed to 9:10, as the step from II to III then becomes 8:9.<br/>Nevertheless, that is the rule employed by the ODEION program<br/>in &apos;Natural Mode&apos; which gave rise to the piece called Natural No.1-<br/>003. (ODEION has 3 modes of operation, which I called, rightly or<br/>wrongly, &apos;Natural&apos;, &apos;Melodic&apos; and &apos;Equal&apos;. In &apos;Melodic&apos;, the<br/>allowable steps are user selected and in &apos;Equal&apos; all possible steps<br/>are allowed. &apos;Melodic&apos; works well with chordal scales - which amounts<br/>to arpeggiating a chord and &apos;Equal&apos; does not seem to produce anything<br/>listenable).</p><p>Bear in mind as well that that piece in particular does not employ<br/>the Natural Major scale but instead uses the Phrygian Dominant scale<br/>which is identical to mode V of the Harmonic Minor scale. It auto-<br/>modulates, moving the tonic to scale degree IV, whenever scale degree<br/>IV (i.e. pitch class 5) occurs as the first note in a bar (=<br/>US &apos;measure&apos;) in the &apos;Canto Firmo&apos; (I use the term loosely and by<br/>analogy) which role is held by the bass line in this particular piece.</p><p>I have yet to perform a full analysis to determine whether the piece<br/>really is in the key that I, and the ODEION program, think it is in.<br/>What I mean by this is that the actual tonic may not be degree I of<br/>the Phyrygian Dominant scale. It could be that the true scale is in<br/>fact the Harmonic Minor and that, therefore, the tonic actually lies<br/>at what the program thinks is degree V of the Phrygian Dominant scale.</p><p>I have also found that ODEION works better (i.e. generates &apos;better&apos;<br/>melodies) with Mode II (&apos;Dorian&apos;) of the Natural Major scale than it<br/>does with Mode I (&apos;Ionian&apos;). This may be for the reason given above<br/>or it may be because the &apos;Dorian Mode&apos; is symmetrical in terms of the<br/>contained 5ths. Once again, examples of this need tonal analysis to<br/>discover what is really going on.</p><p>It is in some ways as much of a mystery to me as it must be to anyone.</p><p>Regards<br/>Peter</p></div><h3><a id=49949 href="#49949">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2003 2:53:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Peter, it seems to me that your site explains very well the<br/>strong<br/>&gt; &gt; argument for 12-tone music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where?

We all have a simple-<br/>minded side. If you do not, which may well be possible, then you are<br/>in a very small and lonely minority.

The real comb filters of interest to Peter are<br/>&gt;&gt; probably natural/rational versions of the scales composers use in<br/>&gt;&gt; 12-equal.

Those passpands determine the limits of ratios<br/>&gt;that can be called dodekaphonic. The so-called &apos;harmonic 7th&apos; (4:7)<br/>&gt;is not and can never be a dodekaphonic pitch according to this scheme.</p><p>Right, and I think it&apos;s a good scheme.

It is possible to think of diatonic scales<br/>  &gt;   &gt; in terms of the notes missing from the full chromatic.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   but the argument that Carl, Kurt, and myself are presenting<br/>  &gt;   to you (Peter) is that Mozart, in his orchestral music<br/>  &gt;   (not his keyboard works, which are 12-tone and well-tempered)<br/>  &gt;   manifestly did *not* intend his 7-tone diatonic scales to be<br/>  &gt;   subsets of a &quot;dodekaphonic&quot; (12-tone) gamut, but rather,<br/>  &gt;   subsets of a 20-tone tuning in which flats differ from sharps,<br/>  &gt;   which in turn was intended to be a subset of 55edo.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   if you read my webpage in its entirety, including the<br/>  &gt;   quotations from Attwood&apos;s notebooks, you&apos;ll see this.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   you&apos;re trying to force Mozart&apos;s orchestral tuning into<br/>  &gt;   your dodekaphonic straight-jacket and that&apos;s not what<br/>  &gt;   it&apos;s supposed to be.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   -monz<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   May it be allowed to say that  Mozart had the idea of a<br/>  &gt; special tuning model in his mind when he was writing a<br/>  &gt; composition?<br/>  &gt;   Indeed, we have reasons to believe that he knew the<br/>  &gt; possibilities and limits of contemporary keyboards which<br/>  &gt; have been almost tuned near to. E.T., but:<br/>  &gt;   He (as well as other composers) oftenly transcribed his<br/>  &gt; compositions from orchestra to piano, from piano to<br/>  &gt; string quartet or harmony music and inverse.<br/>  &gt;   If his keyboard works &quot;are 12 tone and well-tempered&quot;<br/>  &gt; every transcribtion would have been a treason to the<br/>  &gt; &quot;original work tuning idea&quot;.  Mozart would laugh at such<br/>  &gt; ideas.<br/>  &gt;   Or did I misunderstand something?</p><p>  Mozart&apos;s teaching to Attwood clearly indicates that he<br/>  wanted 55edo as his tuning basis.  the flats are supposed<br/>  to be &quot;one comma&quot; higher than their enharmonically equivalent<br/>  sharps.</p><p>  if he really transcribed pieces from piano to orchestra,<br/>  then clearly he had a flexible view of intonation, because<br/>  the keyboard&apos;s 12-tone weel-temperament behaves differently<br/>  from the orchestra&apos;s 20-tone subset of 55edo.</p><p>  there are also instances of enharmonic modulation in Mozart,<br/>  which also clearly indicates that in some instances, flats<br/>  and sharps in his compositions are supposed to be &quot;the same&quot;.</p><p>  (i&apos;m not necessarily claiming that they are tuned to exactly<br/>  the same frequency, but the context of his usage indicates<br/>  equivalence.)</p><p>  -monz</p><p>  Hi monz,</p><p>  I agree that in Mozart&apos;s compositions the sharps and flats<br/>  seem to be used and performed best with the same or nearly<br/>  the same frequency. But this does every well educated<br/>  orchestra or chamber music group, too, nevertheless<br/>  they are doing this with flexible intonation and performing<br/>  the chords and harmonic structures according to - or near to -<br/>  just intonation.<br/>  Is this a contradiction in terms? Not for people who have<br/>  been sitting in orchestras and chamber music groups. On the<br/>  one hand they adjust their frequencies in the actual harmonic<br/>  situation near to just intonation, on the other hand the average<br/>  level of a virtual equal tempered level of mastertune is<br/>  remembered in the background, so that the actual tuning level<br/>  doesn&apos;t drift too much away from this line. And a major chord<br/>  F#-A#-C# for an orchestra will be performed in almost the same<br/>  tuning level like Gb-Bb-Db<br/>  But I assume: You know this as well as I do?</p><p>  The problem by discussing in this forum is: Depending of our<br/>  musical origin we are thinking in different categories.<br/>  An orchestra musician thinks in flexible frequencies adjusted<br/>  near to. E.T.<br/>  A keyboarder thinks perhaps in a 1/4 comma meantone system where<br/>  the difference between G# and Ab is by about 41 Cents.<br/>  A &quot;just intonation creator&quot; as they are represented by a lot of<br/>  members of this list sets perhaps the difference between F# and Gb<br/>  to 24 Cents (pythagorean comma) or 22 Cents (syntonic comma) or....,<br/>  depending on his own or preferred system.<br/>  (As I am a &quot;creator of just intonation&quot;, too, I want to add,<br/>  that for my system F#-A#-C# and Gb-Bb-Db will be the same in default).<br/>  What I want to say: It is hard for everyone, even for me, to change<br/>  his thinking structures and to understand the other. Or to listen<br/>  attentive to him.</p><p>  Well, I don&apos;t understand the term &quot;20-tone subset of 55edo&quot;<br/>  and my problem is: I have a in advance an aversion against an<br/>  idea pressing orchestral or choral music in a fix raster of<br/>  frequencies.<br/>  But maybe I am erroneous? Wher do I find informations in this<br/>  &quot;20-tone subset of 55edo&quot; system?</p><p>  But I want to contradict the idea that composers are<br/>  fixed to tuning systems by their composition&apos;s ideas.<br/>  This would mean that the young Bach would have composed in<br/>  Meantone categories, the old Bach in well-tempered categories,<br/>  Liszt in equal tempered categories, 12-tone compositors in<br/>  equal tempered categories.<br/>  Indeed: It was may opinion that for 12 tone music equal<br/>  temperament will be the adequate temperament. But at a discussion<br/>  with a 12 tone composer (Huber) he told me that when he is<br/>  writing a third interval he has the idea that this has to be<br/>  performed in just intonaton &quot;if possible&quot;.</p><p>  regards<br/>  Werner</p><p>  You do not need web access to participate.

I didn&apos;t say that Mozart or Bach<br/>  or any other composer, even you, couldn&apos;t hear their compositions in their<br/>mind before setting it down to paper.<br/>  I only wanted to say that in their mind as well as in your mind there was<br/>or is an &quot;idea of the compostion on<br/>  itself&quot; before writing it down. I believe that composers have in their<br/>mind the &quot;ideal of a fifth<br/>  or a third&quot; and not a fifth or a third in any tuning model or temperament.<br/>  And I repeat: Mozart would laugh at the idea that he called over different<br/>tuning models in his<br/>  mind when composing either for a piano or on the other hand for a string<br/>quartet.<br/>  (Indeed, he certainly knew the different result in acoustic, but this was<br/>not the question).<br/>  And you should not be shocked by the idea of a laughing Mozart...</p><p>  Besides, we are all creature of our time, nevertheless actually (at our<br/>time) there are &quot;musical creatures&quot;<br/>  who believe  that a &quot;well tempered&quot; tuning model (and not knowing what<br/>this term means) is the best tuning<br/>  for all kinds of music. And there are others, no &quot;creatures&quot;, but the<br/>members of this list who are looking<br/>  for the best tools<br/>  - either to perform  traditional music with adequate tuning models<br/>  - or looking for new tuning models for experimental music.<br/>   I belong mainly to the traditional group and have developed tools for<br/>this. But I possess also tools<br/>   for experimental tunings.<br/>  You belong to both groups.<br/>  We all - or at least most of us - follow this idea, sometimes by different<br/>models, but this doesn&apos;t matter.<br/>  In this way there is no reason for a fundamental dissension.</p><p>  Regarding the &quot;20-tone subset of 55edo&quot; system of Telemann: Maybe I will<br/>find the precise information<br/>  in this list, but I think I will look for it in german sites.

However, I must make a (funny) point here:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot; &lt;sault@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think the best argument of all is the infectious nature of<br/>&gt; dodekaphony. It may well be a case of simple things pleasing simple<br/>&gt; minds but, at risk of sounding patronizing towards humanity in<br/>&gt; general, simple minds are in the majority. We all have a simple-<br/>&gt; minded side. If you do not, which may well be possible, then you<br/>are<br/>&gt; in a very small and lonely minority. Perhaps the world&apos;s<br/>acknowledged<br/>&gt; best composers were only playing to the crowd - but whatever their<br/>&gt; motive they have always stuck to a roughly logarithmic 12-tone<br/>&gt; division of the 8ve. Stockhausen, on the other hand, has<br/>disappeared<br/>&gt; into the depths of obscurity and is of interest only to hardcore<br/>&gt; musicologists (myself excluded).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dodekaphony is certainly not for simple minds. Just give&apos;em<br/>heptatonic, or even more plain music.</p><p>&gt; While I do not deny that other possibilities exist, trying to get<br/>&gt; people off dodekaphony is a bit like banning alcohol or, for that<br/>&gt; matter, maryjane. Ban it and people will gather together in secret<br/>to<br/>&gt; indulge in it. I cannot imagine that happening for music created<br/>with<br/>&gt; obscure and esoteric divisions of the 8ve.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If heptatonicy is maryjane, dodekaphony is horse. And don&apos;t even try<br/>31-eq. There&apos;s no coming back... ;)<br/>Max.</p><p>&gt; Also please note that the central purpose of my analysis<br/>titled &apos;The<br/>&gt; Ring of Truth&apos; is not to &apos;prove&apos; that dodekaphony is the be-all and<br/>&gt; end-all of civilization but to demonstrate that symmetric JI is the<br/>&gt; most likely source of the Babylonian degree of angle and the Vedic<br/>&gt; minute of time and that by extension 360-day solar calendars are<br/>&gt; secondary derivations. The ODEION program is merely a spin-off.<br/>That<br/>&gt; ODEION can produce listenable melodic structures, which just about<br/>&gt; everyone else here has concluded for themselves, should give you<br/>food<br/>&gt; for thought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter</p></div><h3><a id=50003 href="#50003">ðŸ”—</a>monz@attglobal.net</h3><span>12/16/2003 12:19:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Werner,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Werner Mohrlok&quot; &lt;wmohrlok@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   Hi monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I agree that in Mozart&apos;s compositions the sharps and flats<br/>&gt;   seem to be used and performed best with the same or nearly<br/>&gt;   the same frequency. But this does every well educated<br/>&gt;   orchestra or chamber music group, too, nevertheless<br/>&gt;   they are doing this with flexible intonation and performing<br/>&gt;   the chords and harmonic structures according to - or near to -<br/>&gt;   just intonation.<br/>&gt;   Is this a contradiction in terms? Not for people who have<br/>&gt;   been sitting in orchestras and chamber music groups. On the<br/>&gt;   one hand they adjust their frequencies in the actual harmonic<br/>&gt;   situation near to just intonation, on the other hand the average<br/>&gt;   level of a virtual equal tempered level of mastertune is<br/>&gt;   remembered in the background, so that the actual tuning level<br/>&gt;   doesn&apos;t drift too much away from this line.

For Mozart to<br/>use &quot;uncomfortable&quot; keys is to get a fresh sound, no?  Besides, there was no<br/>wolf in the extended meantone paradigm.</p><p>  re Telemann: I do have the German urtext.  It really is fascinating that<br/>Telemann should have thought out extended sixth-comma meantone at the end of<br/>his life.  Maybe he had this worked out much sooner, waiting until bedridden<br/>before he wrote down the detail.</p><p>  best, Johnny</p><p>  Hi Johnny,<br/>  regarding the pieces in Eb major in Mozarts operas or, on the other hand<br/>for instance<br/>  the Eb major symphony: I know them all by musical interpretations near to<br/>just intonation. I don&apos;t<br/>  believe that these pieces will be morer authentic in a &quot;sharp tuned&quot;<br/>interpretation.<br/>  In other case my own personal efforts in orchestras and chamber music,<br/>combined with<br/>  many hours of tuning discussions in these groups and combined with hard<br/>work to be<br/>  &quot;in tune&quot; would have been absurd.<br/>  But I am speaking for myself and not &quot;ex cathedra&quot;. Everyone is free to<br/>have his own idea<br/>  of this.</p><p>  Regarding Telemann: I cannot answer before have studied him. I know that<br/>he was very<br/>  interested in tuning problems and I know that he tested a &quot;klavier&quot; with<br/>much more keys than<br/>  12 per octave. And he was enthusiasm on it. The original one (or a replica<br/>?) is, I believe,<br/>  to find at the &quot;Deutsches Museum&quot;<br/>  in M&iuml;&iquest;&half;nchen.</p><p>  I have to add something:<br/>  In one of my last messages I wrote &quot;Mozart would have laughed at....&quot; as I<br/>wanted to translate<br/>  the german term &quot;lachen &iuml;&iquest;&half;ber..&quot; which means somehow &quot;to be amused&quot;<br/>(without any negative<br/>  touch). Now my dictionary says to me that this english term is the<br/>translation of the german<br/>  term &quot;auslachen&quot; which is a negative one, discriminating the opposite<br/>person.<br/>  This was not my intention and I apologize for this.</p><p>  best, Werner</p><p>        Yahoo!

Not for people who have<br/>  &gt;   been sitting in orchestras and chamber music groups. On the<br/>  &gt;   one hand they adjust their frequencies in the actual harmonic<br/>  &gt;   situation near to just intonation, on the other hand the average<br/>  &gt;   level of a virtual equal tempered level of mastertune is<br/>  &gt;   remembered in the background, so that the actual tuning level<br/>  &gt;   doesn&apos;t drift too much away from this line.

And it is<br/>much easy to<br/>  control pure fifths by ear, but very difficult to perform exact weighted<br/>beats of<br/>  - for instance - 1/4 comma meantone fifths?<br/>  Why should string and wind instruments follow the intonation problems of<br/>keyboards?<br/>  By having pity with them?</p><p>  Best<br/>  Werner</p><p>  You do not need web access to participate.

Hearing an exact tempered fifth of any kind is easily<br/>repeatable.<br/>  &gt; I have done so with other musicians for decades.  &gt; The bassoon can play<br/>any<br/>  &gt; single tuning system, besides.</p><p>  Yes, it can, but it is always a hard battle...</p><p>  &gt; When you say Mozart, I say Bach.  Why?  Because I really know the<br/>details for Bach,<br/>  &gt; and only learned of Mozart&apos;s tuning practices later.  Bach in just<br/>intonation is awful.</p><p>  I agree. But for most other traditional music, written with third and<br/>fifth intervals it<br/>  is awful, too.</p><p>   &gt; The master of temperament is thus eviscerated, indeed castrated.</p><p>   &gt;  Also, narrow fifths may be necessary if there is modulation involved<br/>as in Mozart.<br/>   &gt;  Werner, your bias for &quot;reine stimmung&quot; is showning.<br/>  If you would say: &quot;your bias for a better approach to just intonation...&quot;<br/>I can agree.</p><p>   &gt; But I hope you have the patience to sift through early music a second<br/>time in your<br/>   &gt; lifetime to account for tuning practices that are poorly advertised to<br/>today&apos;s musicians.</p><p>  Johnny, you are right and please believe me: I am no analphabet regarding<br/>the history<br/>  of tuning and temperament.

(In some languages, the cognate of &quot;dodekaphony&quot; is the<br/>&gt;&gt; only term for 12-tone technique.

Apparently I should<br/>&gt; be using the term &apos;Chromatic Scale&apos;. The reasons I did not use that<br/>&gt; in the first place was that the term &apos;chromatic&apos; did not necessarily,<br/>&gt; to my mind, indicate a specifically 12-tone octave and that I had<br/>&gt; perceived the possibility of N-tone chromatic scales based on<br/>&gt; divisions of the octave according to 2^(1/N) steps, where N is not<br/>&gt; equal to 12, and wanted to be absolutely clear about my intent. Also<br/>&gt; the term &apos;Chromaticism&apos; has other, prior, meanings that I was already<br/>&gt; aware of.</p><p>Hmm.  Now coming back and rereading this post (after having just posted a<br/>reply to &quot;Re: [tuning] Re: Dodekachrome - Gene&quot; regarding &quot;chromatic&quot;), I&apos;m<br/>wondering to what degree equal-temperament figures into your sense of what<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; means.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Priority is important to you, why not call it &quot;Sault&apos;s technique&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a bit too personal and I did not invent music but thanks for<br/>&gt; the thought. How about &apos;Dodekachrome&apos; (noun) and &apos;Dodekachromatic&apos;<br/>&gt; (adj.)? Or else it could be &apos;Dodekatone&apos; and &apos;Dodekatonic&apos; but these<br/>&gt; do not, to my mind, indicate equal value steps. All opinions welcomed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And priority is surely important to everyone except the Pythagoreans,<br/>&gt; who wrote everything in the name of Pythagoras.

I haven&apos;t spent more than a<br/>few<br/>&gt; &gt;minutes trying out a Fokker keyboard (on an Archiphone), but I can<br/>&gt; &gt;vouch that the generalized keyboard employed on the Scalatron was<br/>&gt; &gt;much more comfortable right from the start.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have not forgotten, and you&apos;ll see I was defending multiphonic<br/>&gt; keyboards in this thread.  I was simply letting Gene in on what<br/>&gt; was being discussed -- keyboards, not tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;To say that negotiating 31-ET on the GK Scalatron is &quot;workable&quot;<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;be an understatement -- in my opinion it&apos;s easier than playing 12-<br/>ET<br/>&gt; &gt;on a conventional keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never played your scalatron, but I&apos;m afraid I cannot agree with<br/>&gt; your statement.  More notes and more harmonic relationships are in<br/>&gt; some sense harder,</p><p>True, but I have found that the amount of time and effort required to<br/>learn a multitude of patterns to play the same things in different<br/>keys on the conventional keyboard is greater than what is required to<br/>learn new notes and relationships on the generalized keyboard. As a<br/>matter of fact, the generalized keyboard makes it unnecessary to<br/>memorize, for example, the particular tone that&apos;s a (slightly<br/>tempered) harmonic seventh above an E-semiflat in 31-ET.  All I have<br/>to do is locate the E-semiflat on the keyboard (the blue E key) and<br/>play a harmonic 7th interval, and my finger naturally falls on D-<br/>flat.  I can do it almost without thinking, because the intervals are<br/>learned kinesthethically (as well as visually and aurally).</p><p>&gt; even if there were a cultural construct to support<br/>&gt; them.  But there isn&apos;t, and we are completely in the dark.  If it is<br/>&gt; so easy, please share with us your 31-tone music.</p><p>I never wrote anything in 31-ET, but I spent a lot of time at the<br/>keyboard just trying various things out on it (I guess you could call<br/>it improvising).  The ease with which I could play whatever<br/>intervals, chords, and melodic patterns that came to mind (in<br/>whatever key I happened to be in) made it pretty obvious to me that<br/>this sort of keyboard is *highly* workable.</p><p>I did record a couple of short compositions in 31-ET (by Fokker and<br/>Mandelbaum) on half-track open-reel tape, and I could make mp3 files<br/>of those and send them to you, if you wish (for your personal use).<br/>Unfortunately, the instrument is now in disrepair, so I would not be<br/>able to record anything else on it at this time.

Even not at that times.<br/>  1. What did the lutes? Setting a meantone temperament on a lute<br/>  is impossible.<br/>  2. You say: &quot;I *do* agree that, regardless of which tuning is<br/>  &quot;supposed&quot; to be used, good orchestral musicians will not be<br/>  able to resist the inclination to make vertical sonorities<br/>  approach JI as closely as possible&quot;.<br/>  - But I said the opposite: &quot;It is easy (in comparison) to<br/>  tune near to JI, but difficult to weight precisely the beats<br/>  for meantone fifths&quot;.<br/>  3. A harpsichord can be retuned very easily so that the<br/>  idea of an extented meantone temperament can be followed.<br/>  I know this by own experience.<br/>  But what was the ideal for an orchestra when beeing in<br/>  accompaniment by a pipe orgen in meantone temperament and<br/>  by only 12 keys per octave? Following the fifth and<br/>  third wolfes of this instrument? Or avoiding these chords?<br/>  But some composers didn&apos;t weight the limitations of<br/>  such instruments.</p><p>  I agree: Since the invention of the major third in the 13th<br/>  or 14th century there exist people who try to realize this<br/>  in the best way. And we both follow the same idea. As well<br/>  as most of this tuning list. And I like all temperaments<br/>  for keyboards which bring the tuning to better-than-ET.<br/>  But the best way depends on the instrumental situation<br/>  and on the actual performed music.<br/>  And I  mistrust the written traditions. Scientists of music<br/>  are almost thinking in keyboard categories. But the major<br/>  third hasn&apos;t been invented by keyboarders or scientists<br/>  of music. These have only adopted this idea and try to<br/>  follow it as best as possible by their (keyboard) tuning<br/>  constructions.<br/>  Nobody can do more than &quot;as best as possible&quot; but as an<br/>  orchestra can do it better than a keyboard I doubt that<br/>  even in the 17th or 18th century all orchestra<br/>  instrumentalists liked to follow the keyboard restrictions.</p><p>  Best<br/>  Werner</p></div><h3><a id=50168 href="#50168">ðŸ”—</a>Werner Mohrlok &#x3C;wmohrlok@hermode.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2003 11:03:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>-----Urspr&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>  Von: Gene Ward Smith [<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org</a>]<br/>  Gesendet: Samstag, 20.

This was<br/>  and I am now speaking of the 16th/ 17th century):<br/>  If the string and wind instruments generally had to follow<br/>  an ideal of meantone temperament of about 1/4 - 1-6 comma)<br/>  they had a new conflict when the keyboard was<br/>  substituted by lutes, tuned near to. E.T.<br/>  At actual concerts we have nearly the same situation with<br/>  piano concerts accompained by an orchestra.<br/>  In todays orchestras the instrumentalists<br/>  (as to my experience) regard the pianos tuning as<br/>  a &quot;reference&quot; height, nevertheless the orchestra groups<br/>  follow more or less the idea of chords in just intonation.<br/>  They don&apos;t follow the E.T, as this would sound poor<br/>  and they don&apos;t follow a meantone model of 12 tones<br/>  in fixed tuned heights, as the deviation of some notes<br/>  like Eb or G#  from E.T. could be too large.<br/>  I like this more flexible model and I don&apos;t believe that<br/>  musicians of the 16th or 17th century in such<br/>  situations have been less flexible and have followed<br/>  their internal meantone raster instead of weighting<br/>  the lute&apos;s tuning height.<br/>  It was never the question that with a keyboard<br/>  tuned to any meantone model the orchestra instruments<br/>  have to follow the tuning of a keyboard &quot;as best<br/>  as possible&quot;.<br/>  The dissens between us is: You believe that<br/>  they did it with a tuning raster of 55ETO, not only<br/>  in their mind but also concrete(!) and I say:<br/>  The tuning behavior in an actual orchestra is<br/>  more flexible. I cannot believe that in ancient<br/>  times they would have been less flexible.<br/>  But you don&apos;t need to follow me. Even<br/>  I don&apos;t follow you. Nevertheless I pay<br/>  respect to your knowledge and to your kind informations.</p><p>  &gt; &gt;    2.

String and wind instrument players and singers<br/>  against this almost don&apos;t think in such categories.

And Mozart, I had to learn by &quot;monz&quot;, did<br/>  follow this static model.

As Peter W.

The<br/>&gt; tempering of fifths was then one of the most basic parts of a<br/>&gt; musician&apos;s education, and in the 16th-18th centuries, only a<br/>&gt; rather &apos;rustic&apos; string player would tune the open strings to pure<br/>&gt; fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nevertheless, Werner, you may be quite right that non-keyboard<br/>&gt; musicians in those times would *adaptively* adjust all the fifths<br/>&gt; toward purity. As I&apos;ve argued before, this would only require<br/>shifts<br/>&gt; of a couple of cents -- essentially imperceptible -- from an<br/>&gt; underlying meantone grid. However, I find that, contrary to your<br/>&gt; assertions, the most highly respected ensembles today fail to<br/>adjust<br/>&gt; their thirds and sixths away from 12-equal and toward purity more<br/>&gt; often than they do do so -- therefore I would not be suprised if<br/>the<br/>&gt; different &quot;entrenched standard&quot; of meantone in the Renaissance-<br/>&gt; Baroque-Classical periods indeed showed up in ensemble playing<br/>more<br/>&gt; than you seem willing to admit -- especially when open strings<br/>were<br/>&gt; called for.</p><p>Yes, entrenched.

Their fingerboards have cracks?  Sounded good to me.</p><p>  Hi Jeff,</p><p>  These signs (almost arrows): Higher, a little higher, deeper,<br/>  a little deeper, have to be understood as *in comparision to ET*.<br/>  They are common in use in chamber music ensembles with strings<br/>  and/ or wind instruments.<br/>  Indeed, there exist, too, a lot of detailed signs, created by<br/>  scientists of music, but these follow more or less abstract ideas<br/>  and I never found them in the notes of an orchestra.<br/>  In chamber music trials there is always an intensive discussion<br/>  in correct tuning: How to tune fifths and thirds as best as possible?<br/>  In chamber music this requires about 30 % of the trial time.<br/>  Indeed, I can only say this for these ensembles in which I was a<br/>  member or for others, whose members I know personally.<br/>  In orchestras the problem is different. There is no time to discuss<br/>  the subject of tuning in full-length. There it is the task of the<br/>  members itself and off the different &quot;Stimmf&iuml;&iquest;&half;hrer&quot; (this means the<br/>  leader of an instrumental groups) to discuss it briefly at the<br/>  trial itself or by short repetitions with the instrumental group<br/>  at the rest.<br/>  In orchestras there is a additional difficulty:<br/>  Tuning a major chord near to just intonation is simple for a musician<br/>  as he can control just intonation by the disappearing of the beats.<br/>  This means, one hasn&apos;t to follow any abstract idea, one may only<br/>  follow the acoustic result.<br/>  But for minor chords there exist two different frequency ratios for<br/>  *just* intonation:<br/>  The first one is<br/>  root : minor third : fifth = 10 : 12 : 15,<br/>  (with the same third frequency ratios like major chords in<br/>  just intonation).<br/>  The second one is<br/>  root : minor third : fifth = 16 : 19 : 14,<br/>  which is very near to ET. It sounds as good as the first one.<br/>  It is recommandable to follow the ratios of the first example as<br/>  with the second one the changes from a major chord<br/>  to its minor parallel chord - or inverse - would cause frequency<br/>  jumpings.<br/>  But one has to learn this. This means: At minor chords<br/>  one cannot only &quot;trust the ears&quot;, one has to follow knowingly<br/>  one of this both ideas.<br/>  And indeed, I sometimes realise that at stops and fermates<br/>  with a minor chord there exist two groups in the orchestra,<br/>  one of them following the first and one of them<br/>  following the other idea.</p><p>  An additional difficulty is: A string instrument player<br/>  can change the position of the referring finger on the chord.<br/>  For wind instrument players there exist other means. Some as<br/>  described above (with the Quantz example), others by changing<br/>  the frequency by different embouchment and breath support.<br/>  Nevertheless not all tones of a wind instrument are flexible.<br/>  Some are few flexible and others have a tendence<br/>  to be &quot;high&quot; or &quot;deep&quot;.<br/>  Therefore a well educated musician never may say: &quot;I am correct,<br/>  it is not my problem whether my neighbor will tune deeper or higher<br/>  than to the ideal ferquency&quot;. A well educated musician will<br/>  additionally weight the height of the tones tones of his neighbour<br/>  or his neighbourship. Indeed, a result of this may be that<br/>  in this way the better instrumentalist will follow the weak one.</p><p>  Conclusion: Paul may be right when criticizing that many<br/>  orchestras are not following an all embracing *just intonation*,<br/>  nevertheless I maintain my opinion: The idea of tuning<br/>  in most of the actual ensembles are perfect fifths and(!)thirds<br/>  and at least at major chords one can hear this and one doesn&apos;t<br/>  need to measure it.</p><p>  Werner</p></div><h3><a id=50776 href="#50776">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2004 10:07:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 01 Jan 2004 02:11:31 -0000, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; i been sticking with mp3 because it seems to me to be<br/>&gt;&gt; a more universal format.  can OGG files be played in<br/>&gt;&gt; those stand-alone mp3 players?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That depends on which ones you try it with.

It has had been one of his research topics.<br/>He said that there is much overstating of the role of European<br/>serialist and US-American 12-tone composers. In his opinion, they<br/>were always in the minority, but appear to be larger because on one<br/>hand they published theory articles and books and on the other hand<br/>their music was, for some time, the music that &quot;pushed the barriers<br/>to something new&quot;, so it is the music that ends up in the history<br/>books. If you compose using more traditional technique, there is<br/>probably less to write about. (Though Daniel says alternative tunings<br/>can change this).</p><p>But the serialists and 12-tone composers never had the most<br/>performances or the most professorships.  Stockhausen was and is<br/>never as performed as Henze.  Babbitt never as much as Persichetti or<br/>Thomson.  Exception may be France, but Boulez&apos;s supremacy came not at<br/>the cost of non-serialism but at the cost of anything other than<br/>Boulez.</p><p>Daniel studied performance records in Germany. Hartmann and Hindemith<br/>were/are always more performed that Webern or Stochausen.  More<br/>important, H &amp; H were performed on ordinary concert programs, not in<br/>special new music programs.</p><p>Hungary is different, too, because 12-tone/serialism had another<br/>meaning for Central and Easteran Europe composers. Read about it, and<br/>John Cage too, in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.</p><p>Gabor</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@z...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;America did suffer much more of the serialist music theory<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;than Europe, which tends to stress the perfection of 12.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, I&apos;m not.

It&apos;s evident to me that among the most famous<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;most highly respected groups, a huge number, perhaps even a<br/>majority,<br/>&gt; &gt;show no tendency to mutate their harmonies toward just intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve mentioned a number of groups here.  Virtually any early music<br/>&gt; group will show this tendency.  Modern string quartets, big bands,<br/>&gt; etc. not as often.

Johann Joachim Quantz (On Playing the Flute,<br/>1753)<br/>&gt;    &gt; has an interestingly precise tuning instruction.  I gave away<br/>my<br/>&gt;    &gt; last copy but maybe in chapter 4, where the fingering charts<br/>are, he<br/>&gt;    &gt; says that the difference between a sharp and the enharmonic<br/>flat is<br/>&gt;    &gt; one ninth of a whole tone.  That is exactly the subset of<br/>55edo,<br/>&gt;    &gt; where c-c# is the 55th root of 2 to the 4th, c#-d the same to<br/>the<br/>&gt;    &gt; 5th, but Db-D again only to the 4th, etc.  This is<br/>approximately<br/>&gt;    &gt; enough, 6th comma meantone, and in fact splits the difference<br/>&gt;    &gt; between the commas of Pythagoras and Didymus.  Quantz gives<br/>compleat<br/>&gt;    &gt; fingerings for 18 or 19 steps per octave, not theory but<br/>practice.<br/>&gt;    &gt; He was entirely mainstream since he served in King Frederick&apos;s<br/>&gt;    &gt; orchestra with Emmanuel Bach, and their writings underpin<br/>Classical<br/>&gt;    &gt; music.  He and Bach emphasize good taste and style.  I take it<br/>that<br/>&gt;    &gt; this degree of control over intonation was required.  I hadn&apos;t<br/>seen<br/>&gt;    &gt; the information on Mozart&apos;s opinions to Attwood before, so my<br/>thanks<br/>&gt;    &gt; to our contributors, Monz, Werner, et al.  On the matter of<br/>&gt;    &gt; intonation, the musical education establishment is<br/>degenerate.  I<br/>&gt;    &gt; gave my copies of Bach and Quantz to my niece, who is currently<br/>&gt;    &gt; negotiating the university cirriculum, may her ears be opened.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    &gt; On St. Paul Sunday I heard Kronos Quartet play Harry Partch,<br/>sorry<br/>&gt;    &gt; for no title.  Funny to hear them talk afterwards about the<br/>plus and<br/>&gt;    &gt; minus signs on the notes (their transcription I guess),<br/>and &quot;playing<br/>&gt;    &gt; in the cracks&quot;.  Their fingerboards have cracks?  Sounded good<br/>to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Hi Jeff,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   These signs (almost arrows): Higher, a little higher, deeper,<br/>&gt;   a little deeper, have to be understood as *in comparision to ET*.</p><p>This would not be true for either of the cases above (in the second,<br/>I assume they were looking at Ben Johston&apos;s notation or something<br/>similar).</p><p>&gt;   An additional difficulty is: A string instrument player<br/>&gt;   can change the position of the referring finger on the chord.<br/>&gt;   For wind instrument players there exist other means. Some as<br/>&gt;   described above (with the Quantz example),</p><p>The difference between the Quantz example and what you are describing<br/>is that in the 16th-18th centuries, G# was assumed a lower note than<br/>Ab, Eb a higher note than D#, etc. So all of the 19 notes per octave<br/>for which Quantz provided fingerings would have been indicated with<br/>different notations in the music, thus it was not a question of<br/>tuning the same notated note differently in different instances. Now,<br/>certainly some players may still have done the latter to make the<br/>harmonies vertically just, but the deviations involved, and thus the<br/>worst retuning motions encountered in sustained or repeated notes,<br/>would have been considerably smaller than if ET (that is, 12-equal)<br/>were taken as a baseline. It is only with Beethoven (and his<br/>newfangled modulations) that we begin to see a predominant assumption<br/>of enharmonic equivalence, and hence it is not surprising that around<br/>1800, the teaching of intonation divorced itself from meantone models<br/>and began embracing systems with only 12 notes per octave, and even<br/>concepts of &apos;expressive intonation&apos; (putting G# *higher* than Ab, Eb<br/>*lower* than D#, etc.) which were even further from meantone and<br/>would result in even worse harmonies than 12-equal. Though some sort<br/>of adaptive tuning could still occur from this kind of baseline<br/>(though it would have larger retuning motions), my sense is that the<br/>intonation of many string quartets, etc., today shows very little<br/>tendency toward JI verticalities (chords, simultaneities) for<br/>pedagogic reasons that trace back to this period about 200 years ago.</p><p>&gt;   A well educated musician will<br/>&gt;   additionally weight the height of the tones tones of his neighbour<br/>&gt;   or his neighbourship. Indeed, a result of this may be that<br/>&gt;   in this way the better instrumentalist will follow the weak one.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard this sort of thing dramatically in a duo of young Russian<br/>violinists who would play Bach and the like in Harvard Square in &apos;95<br/>and maybe some subsequent years. The two of them playing together<br/>always sounded sweet, unified as if a single voice. Yet when I got<br/>the chance to hear them each play separately, it became clear that<br/>one was far superior, especially as regarded intonation. Clearly she<br/>had been listening so closely to her inferior colleague, that she<br/>could match her every intonational quirk and produce excellent-tuned<br/>simultaneities against her! I don&apos;t doubt that this is a common<br/>scenario; however there are other factors at work, including a desire<br/>by some musicians to be heard *separately* (and often *above*) from<br/>the ensemble in which they are playing . . .</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=51105 href="#51105">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2004 12:03:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 1/3/04 1:48 AM, Werner Mohrlok &lt;<a href="mailto:wmohrlok@hermode.com">wmohrlok@hermode.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; -----Urspr&uuml;ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>&gt; Von: Kurt Bigler [<a href="mailto:kkb@breathsense.com">mailto:kkb@breathsense.com</a>]<br/>&gt; Gesendet: Samstag, 3.

How to tune precisely is<br/>  controlled by the ears. It is an error that such instrumentalists have a<br/>  reference just intonation on their instrument or in their mind and can<br/>  adjust the height of the tune by a command &quot;14 cents deeper or 4 Cents<br/>  higher or whatever...</p><p>  &gt; &gt;    An additional difficulty is: A string instrument player<br/>  &gt; &gt;    can change the position of the referring finger on the chord.<br/>  &gt; &gt;    For wind instrument players there exist other means. Some as<br/>  &gt; &gt;    described above (with the Quantz example),</p><p>  &gt; The difference between the Quantz example and what you are describing<br/>  &gt; is that in the 16th-18th centuries, G# was assumed a lower note than<br/>  &gt; Ab, Eb a higher note than D#, etc. So all of the 19 notes per octave<br/>  &gt; for which Quantz provided fingerings would have been indicated with<br/>  &gt; different notations in the music, thus it was not a question of<br/>  &gt; tuning the same notated note differently in different instances.</p><p>  I understand the Quantz ideas and his (and your) meantone idea.<br/>  What I want to explain to these members who never have played a wind<br/>  instrument in a professional way is:<br/>  The fingerings are only &quot;helps&quot;. You can &quot;finger&quot; a deep tone and<br/>  create an high one and inverse. And you will do so oftenly if you<br/>  have not ears to hear and not a good technique.<br/>  Nevertheless a G# in a E major chord will be tuned by actual well<br/>  educated ensembles and orchestras deeper and a Ab in a Db major chord<br/>  higher than with ET.</p><p>  &gt; Now,<br/>  &gt; certainly some players may still have done the latter to make the<br/>  &gt; harmonies vertically just, but the deviations involved, and thus the<br/>  &gt; worst retuning motions encountered in sustained or repeated notes,</p><p>  ... if one would follow the idea to adjust the chord&apos;s root on the level<br/>of ET<br/>  and adjust the other notes to this basis. But could you imagine that this<br/>  could even be done otherways? And are you speaking on own experience<br/>  or only on your abstract apprehensions?<br/>  Listen to the musical example which Kurt Bigler sent us with his<br/>  actual mail! I repeat his link:</p><p>   <a href="http://k.breathsense.com/public/jongen1.mp3">http://k.breathsense.com/public/jongen1.mp3</a></p><p>  Do you hear the dramatic difference between the tuning behaviour of the<br/>  orchestra and the rasping organ?<br/>  This orchestra doesn&apos;t follow a meantone temperament,<br/>  it follows two refences: The average tuning height of the organ and<br/>  its own ideas of a &quot;just&quot; or &quot;near to just&quot; intonation.<br/>  Nevertheless you don&apos;t hear retuning, caused by harmonic<br/>  sequences.<br/>  If you possess fine ears, you will hear the french horns<br/>  (about 30 sec after the beginning) by adjusting their frequencies in<br/>  a chord within some milliseconds. But this is a different subject<br/>  and shows only that they are adjusting, too, by ears.</p><p>  &gt; would have been considerably smaller than if ET (that is, 12-equal)<br/>  &gt; were taken as a baseline. It is only with Beethoven (and his<br/>  &gt; newfangled modulations) that we begin to see a predominant assumption<br/>  &gt; of enharmonic equivalence, and hence it is not surprising that around<br/>  &gt; 1800, the teaching of intonation divorced itself from meantone models<br/>  &gt; and began embracing systems with only 12 notes per octave, and even<br/>  &gt; concepts of &apos;expressive intonation&apos; (putting G# *higher* than Ab, Eb<br/>  &gt; *lower* than D#, etc.) which were even further from meantone and<br/>  &gt; would result in even worse harmonies than 12-equal. Though some sort<br/>  &gt; of adaptive tuning could still occur from this kind of baseline<br/>  &gt; (though it would have larger retuning motions), my sense is that the<br/>  &gt; intonation of many string quartets, etc., today shows very little<br/>  &gt; tendency toward JI verticalities (chords, simultaneities) for<br/>  &gt; pedagogic reasons that trace back to this period about 200 years ago.</p><p>  I suggest to select any musical example of music with strings and/ or wind<br/>  ensembles in your disk collection and to repeat it with an instrument;<br/>  tuned in ET.

I gave away<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; my<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; last copy but maybe in chapter 4, where the fingering charts<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; are, he<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   (Snip)<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; On St. Paul Sunday I heard Kronos Quartet play Harry Partch,<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; sorry<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; for no title.  Funny to hear them talk afterwards about the<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; plus and<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; minus signs on the notes (their transcription I guess),<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; and &quot;playing<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; in the cracks&quot;.  Their fingerboards have cracks?  Sounded good<br/>  &gt;   &gt;&gt; to me.<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;    Hi Jeff,<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;    These signs (almost arrows): Higher, a little higher,<br/>  deeper,<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;    a little deeper, have to be understood as *in comparision<br/>  to ET*.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   &gt; This would not be true for either of the cases above (in the<br/>  second,<br/>  &gt;   &gt; I assume they were looking at Ben Johston&apos;s notation or<br/>  something<br/>  &gt;   &gt; similar).<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   Indeed, Paul, as I don&apos;t know all ensembles of this world, I<br/>  cannot speak<br/>  &gt; for all.<br/>  &gt;   &quot;In the second...&quot; Could you imagine that these signs for a well<br/>  educated<br/>  &gt;   string or wind musician are only pointers? How to tune precisely<br/>  is<br/>  &gt;   controlled by the ears. It is an error that such instrumentalists<br/>  have a<br/>  &gt;   reference just intonation on their instrument or in their mind<br/>  and can<br/>  &gt;   adjust the height of the tune by a command &quot;14 cents deeper or 4<br/>  Cents<br/>  &gt;   higher or whatever...</p><p>  What, exactly, are you referring to, and claiming? You&apos;re aware, of<br/>  course, of how the AFMM notates the music it performs . . .</p><p>  &gt;   This orchestra doesn&apos;t follow a meantone temperament,</p><p>  Of course not, we&apos;re way past 1800 now.</p><p>  &gt;   &gt; would have been considerably smaller than if ET (that is, 12-<br/>  equal)<br/>  &gt;   &gt; were taken as a baseline. It is only with Beethoven (and his<br/>  &gt;   &gt; newfangled modulations) that we begin to see a predominant<br/>  assumption<br/>  &gt;   &gt; of enharmonic equivalence, and hence it is not surprising that<br/>  around<br/>  &gt;   &gt; 1800, the teaching of intonation divorced itself from meantone<br/>  models<br/>  &gt;   &gt; and began embracing systems with only 12 notes per octave, and<br/>  even<br/>  &gt;   &gt; concepts of &apos;expressive intonation&apos; (putting G# *higher* than<br/>  Ab, Eb<br/>  &gt;   &gt; *lower* than D#, etc.) which were even further from meantone and<br/>  &gt;   &gt; would result in even worse harmonies than 12-equal. Though some<br/>  sort<br/>  &gt;   &gt; of adaptive tuning could still occur from this kind of baseline<br/>  &gt;   &gt; (though it would have larger retuning motions), my sense is<br/>  that the<br/>  &gt;   &gt; intonation of many string quartets, etc., today shows very<br/>  little<br/>  &gt;   &gt; tendency toward JI verticalities (chords, simultaneities) for<br/>  &gt;   &gt; pedagogic reasons that trace back to this period about 200<br/>  years ago.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   I suggest to select any musical example of music with strings<br/>  and/ or wind<br/>  &gt;   ensembles in your disk collection and to repeat it with an<br/>  instrument;<br/>  &gt;   tuned in ET. Maybe you will change your mind.</p><p>  I spent a lot of time doing this many years ago. For string quartets<br/>  playing Schubert or other romantic music, the tendency does seem to<br/>  be major thirds as wide or wider than ET. At least among the<br/>  recordings I own.</p><p>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;    A well educated musician will<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;    additionally weight the height of the tones tones of his<br/>  neighbour<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;    or his neighbourship. Indeed, a result of this may be that<br/>  &gt;   &gt; &gt;    in this way the better instrumentalist will follow the<br/>  weak one.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;    &gt; I&apos;ve heard this sort of thing dramatically in a duo of young<br/>  Russian<br/>  &gt;    &gt; violinists who would play Bach and the like in Harvard Square<br/>  in &apos;95<br/>  &gt;    &gt; and maybe some subsequent years. The two of them playing<br/>  together<br/>  &gt;    &gt; always sounded sweet, unified as if a single voice. Yet when I<br/>  got<br/>  &gt;    &gt; the chance to hear them each play separately, it became clear<br/>  that<br/>  &gt;    &gt; one was far superior, especially as regarded intonation.<br/>  Clearly she<br/>  &gt;    &gt; had been listening so closely to her inferior colleague, that<br/>  she<br/>  &gt;    &gt; could match her every intonational quirk and produce excellent-<br/>  tuned<br/>  &gt;    &gt; simultaneities against her! I don&apos;t doubt that this is a common<br/>  &gt;    &gt; scenario; however there are other factors at work, including a<br/>  desire<br/>  &gt;    &gt; by some musicians to be heard *separately* (and often *above*)<br/>  from<br/>  &gt;    &gt; the ensemble in which they are playing . . .<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;    &gt; -Paul<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   I am glad to be at least in this subject in common with you.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   Werner</p><p>   &gt; Hopefully you can understand that I&apos;m capable of hearing these things<br/>   &gt; when they&apos;re occuring. In my experience though, among string players,<br/>   &gt; it&apos;s the *folk* musicians who have a good concept of how to make<br/>   &gt; chords sound more just by adjusting their intonation -- aside from<br/>   &gt; early music specialists, the *classical* players fail in this regard<br/>   &gt; more often than not. YMMV. I believe you that your experience has<br/>   &gt; been different. I know others, like Kyle Gann, have expressed similar<br/>   &gt; opinions to my own. I hope he will speak up, but regardless, the<br/>   &gt; important thing is that we respect one another&apos;s experiences.</p><p>   &gt; Also, I&apos;ve tried in a few places in this discussion to steer things<br/>   &gt; toward a discussion of adaptive tuning in theory, such as would<br/>   &gt; pertain to hermode tuning. You&apos;ve managed to misunderstand me on<br/>   &gt; those occasions, and I&apos;m finding it difficult to communicate with you<br/>   &gt; while maintaining any grasp of what the &quot;point&quot; of a particular<br/>   &gt; exchange is -- probably my fault. Can I suggest we each take an extra<br/>   &gt; few minutes in our replies to one another, to hold the hand of the<br/>   &gt; one we&apos;re replying to, and walk him slowly through our reasoning,<br/>   &gt; always with the &quot;goal&quot; or point in mind? I think we could make a<br/>   &gt; great team.</p><p>   &gt; -Paul</p><p>  Paul,</p><p>  sorry. I didn&apos;t want to offence you. I want to tell you something<br/>  of my experience in music and in my background. I was only an amateur<br/>  bassoonist, but I think I was no worse one. I made many music in<br/>  chamber music ensembles, almost woodwind from quintet to octet.<br/>  My companions have been amateurs and professionnal musicians. But<br/>  we always discussed how to tune best to just intonation. Besides<br/>  I was sitting in many orchestras, mixed with professionals and<br/>  amateurs. There was the discussion in such subjects less than in the<br/>  chamber music ensembles as one had to follow the conductor which<br/>  almost had other problems. Nevertheless I knew, that we almost<br/>  followed the idea of just intonation and the young people, coming<br/>  from high schools of music and sitting left and right of me always<br/>  was informed how to tune to just intonation. And they followed<br/>  this idea as best as possible.<br/>  This idea was: holding the root on the basis of ET and to tune the<br/>  major thirds deeper, the minor thirds higher and the fifths a<br/>  little higher. You know: This is not the best way regarding<br/>  the retuning conflicts and the horizontal melodic line.<br/>  Nevertheless this model of a more or less elastic deformed<br/>  ET worked better than the abstract idea, mentioned above.<br/>  This is why sensible musicians are automatically adjusting the<br/>  frequencies mutually (? I hope,I found the correct engish word).<br/>  And this seems to me the best way, I imitated it somehow with<br/>  hermode tuning.</p><p>  Regarding all string and wind ensembles and symphony orchestras,<br/>  I don&apos;t maintain that all of them follow the same idea. Indeed,<br/>  I listened already to some of less quality which seemed to me<br/>  following an ET idea (if ever they had any tuning model idea<br/>  in their mind). And I awared in many live concerts that the<br/>  ensemble have been &quot;out of tune&quot;, especially in the beginning.<br/>  But this seemed to me a problem of insufficient preparation<br/>  as in these concerts the tuning behavior improved within 10 or<br/>  15 minutes.</p><p>  Therefore, I believe, or more than this: I am sure, that in<br/>  *most* actual ensembles the *idea* of just intonation is present<br/>  and my anger bases in a defense of the the former colleagues<br/>  against critiscm.</p><p>  Now I have lost the &quot;goal&quot; completely. But I think we will<br/>  understand us better by knowing more in our personal background.<br/>  I am happy that we both are following the idea of a rich tuning.<br/>  Your different experiences made with *classical* players are<br/>  basing in dissapointments that these ensembles didn&apos;t<br/>  always perform a perfect &quot;just intonation&quot;. But with<br/>  very complex harmonies this is much more difficult then with<br/>  simple folk music. And if, indeed, they haven&apos;t followed the<br/>  *idea*, your criticism is opportune.</p><p>  You wanted to start the discussion in adaptive tuning in<br/>  theory? Sorry, I hope you still will do so. I have prepared<br/>  an information of &quot;hermode tuning&quot;, so that you will be<br/>  able to compare it with other ideas. Some of these ideas<br/>  are presented in our websites. I don&apos;t know whether you<br/>  have studied them.<br/>  The complete information in &quot;hermode tuning&quot; will be<br/>  published as soon as my english (american) corrector will<br/>  have finished his work. It is possible, that he will read<br/>  this message so he perhaps could tell me something about the<br/>  completion of this work.</p><p>  I hope you will be now less dissapointed of me.</p><p>  Kind regards</p><p>  Werner</p></div><h3><a id=51143 href="#51143">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2004 4:31:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Werner Mohrlok&quot; &lt;wmohrlok@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   sorry.

The<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; difference in tonality between the organ and the orchestra<br/>(very<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; string-dominated as I recall) is so dramatic that the contrast<br/>is<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt;  almost<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; laughable to me, because the organ and symphony often play in<br/>&gt;   &gt; &gt;  alternation.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; You have the organ being a big loud macho 12-et organ and then<br/>you have<br/>&gt;   &gt; &gt;  the<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; symphony making everything sound sweet and nice like a picnic<br/>in the<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; country.

There are<br/>&gt; many delicate passages where the organ is playing right along with<br/>&gt; the orchestra.</p><p>Yes, I like those parts the best.  For me it is like the very best of<br/>cinematic romanticism.  It is an interesting problem to combine the<br/>different tuning sensibilities of organ and orchestra and perhaps it is not<br/>surprising that it works out best when the two are playing together rather<br/>than separately.  I wonder what other solutions might be possible.  It might<br/>be interesting if the orchestra could tense up its tuning (toward et, or<br/>perhaps in any other way) and also be able to relax it (toward just).  This<br/>might allow some interesting interplay that would make more sense if some<br/>care was taken with it.</p><p>&gt; And certainly the thematic material is distributed<br/>&gt; evenly.</p><p>&gt; I do agree in places the organ is overpowering; insensitively so.<br/>&gt; However, I suspect this is at least due in part to the recording.<br/>&gt; Organs are notoriously hard to record, for one thing.</p><p>Well, this is the organ at Davies hall in SF.  I don&apos;t know if it is<br/>actually notorious for its blariness but I have heard several different<br/>people say they don&apos;t like it, while never having heard a good review.<br/>However the hall provides a very evident and rather clean reverb (perhaps<br/>too clean) with the organ, something that is not evident in the same way<br/>with the orchestra (nor would you want it to be).  So to me it has a lot of<br/>sonic interest.  I wonder if they adjust the sound balasts (is that what<br/>they are called?) when the organ is being used, so that the hall may be more<br/>blatently live in this scenario than it usually is for pure orchestral use.</p><p>Its been a long time since I heard this organ live though.  It is not used<br/>much (I don&apos;t think), so it is hard to catch organ concerts there since they<br/>are too rare.  I do remember it being &quot;spectacular&quot; though.</p><p>&gt; Personally, symphony orchestra with large organ is not my favorite<br/>&gt; instrumentation.

So<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to here more.  My suspicion is that singing straight toned takes a<br/>&gt; lot more experience so as not to strain the voice (and the body).

It&apos;s like asking a death metal<br/>axeman to play raga on sitar. For many singers there is a clear choice<br/>between operatic and choral careers, and vibrato has a lot to do with the<br/>choice.</p><p>In the choirs that I run the biggest challenge is the wobbly soprano who<br/>turns up to &apos;lend a hand&apos; and who promptly messes up weeks of work.</p><p>Sincerely<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3><a id=51274 href="#51274">ðŸ”—</a>francois_laferriere &#x3C;francois.laferriere@oxymel.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2004 2:50:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>it seems that inflation of the orchestras and of the size of concert<br/>halls troughout the 19th century modified considerably the soloist<br/>singer technique. The name of the game became more and more &quot;don&apos;t get<br/>overwhelmed by the orchestra&quot;.</p><p>This is achieved basically through three techniques, as far as I know.</p><p>1 - the singer formant<br/>2 - extra large vibrato<br/>3 - low tuning (wrt orchestra)</p><p>The singer formant is an energy band where operatic singer learns to<br/>put energy. This is in a high frequency band where classical<br/>orcherstra have little energy, so the singer formant get through,<br/>relatively unmasked by the orchestra. Nothing wrong with that for the<br/>justness.</p><p>A very large vibrato makes the singing voice to stand out and to be<br/>most of the time unmaskable by the orchestra. Typical operatic vibrato<br/>can have amplitude of nearly 100 cents above and below the intended<br/>pitch. That definitely interfere with the perception of justness.</p><p>Finally, operatic singer escape the masking effect by singing &quot;a<br/>little&quot; below the orchesta pitch. There is some psychoacoustic reasons<br/>to sing below and not above the masking pitch: masking effect decrease<br/>more quickly below than above the masking pitch. In principle, the<br/>pitch of the signer should be nearly unperceptibly low, but these<br/>days, many operatic singers (especially male singers) sing<br/>disturbingly low (to my ear at least).</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&iuml;&iquest;&half;ois Laferri&iuml;&iquest;&half;re</p></div><h3><a id=52471 href="#52471">ðŸ”—</a>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;Alexmoog@otenet.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2004 11:19:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I see much talk here about microtonal synths and VSTis , but what keyboards are used?<br/>Is there anything else on the market besides the Star labs Microzone and the Haken Continuum fingerboard?<br/>Are you people making any custom keyboards??</p></div><h3><a id=52472 href="#52472">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2004 11:29:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Is there anything else on the market besides the Star labs<br/>&gt;Microzone and the Haken Continuum fingerboard?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>&gt;Are you people making any custom keyboards??</p><p>Around here?
