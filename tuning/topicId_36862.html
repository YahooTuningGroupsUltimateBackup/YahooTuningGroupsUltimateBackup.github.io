Theres quite a bit of highly technical literature in the<br/>J of the Acoustical Society over the years.</p><p>I ran across many of these when I was doing a project for<br/>Lawson (the french horn guys) where he wanted to suppress<br/>the 7th harmonic of the horn without changing much else.<br/>The project wasnt particularly successful, though I did learn a lot<br/>about horns.</p><p>If you need more than Benades book, I can probably find some of the<br/>detialed references...</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
