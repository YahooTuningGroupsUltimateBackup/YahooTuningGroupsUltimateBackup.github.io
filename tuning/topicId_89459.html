This gives a larger fifth of 1.496838922 or 698.3027739 c., but interestingly, cycling even better in 55 tones (32 steps of 55 = 698,181818...c.).</p><p>Between all these coincidences it seems possible to make simple enough 11-limit (??) performant -c versions of 31, and 55 tones scales.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;bplehman27&quot; &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; See, for example, my page about various sizes of regular (or &quot;meantone&quot;) temps:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/meantone.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/meantone.html</a></p><p>I draw the attention of Michael, who hates the 11/7 interval, to the description of the good 11/7s in 1/5 comma meantone as being useful &quot;Easter eggs&quot; which benefit the tuning. I also draw attention to the fact that the (176/7)^(1/8) fifth of 697.8115 cents is extremely close to the 697.8252 cents &quot;Mohajira squared&quot; fifth which is the root of<br/>f^5-f^4-f^2-1/4 and which appears in the Mohajira tuning we&apos;ve been discussing lately which uses x^5-x^4-1/2 as a generator. The point of the &quot;Mohajira squared&quot; fifth would presumably be you could use a linear recurrence relationship to define a rational intonation which would give results very close to it. Whether that has any potential uses for people who actually tune things I can&apos;t say.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2010 12:07:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;I<br/>draw the attention of Michael, who hates the 11/7 interval, to the<br/>description of the good 11/7s in 1/5 comma meantone as being useful<br/>&quot;Easter eggs&quot; which benefit the tuning.&quot;</p><p>     Actually I digress... my mind has changed on that.  Turns out the &quot;octave inverse&quot; of 11/7 is 14/11...and the 1/1 11/7 2/1 chord is not a bad one at all.  It seems a great example of &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
