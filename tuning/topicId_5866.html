Your cheat,<br/>&gt; when used to blur the distinction between two notes separated by a syntonic<br/>&gt; comma, reflects the fact that musicians treat the two as just one note. But<br/>&gt; if you used it to try to include two notes separated by a chromatic semitone<br/>&gt; using this cheat, you&apos;d be alternating between melodic minor and a different<br/>&gt; scale entirely.</p><p>Yes--this gets into different categories of &quot;unisonous&quot; intervals.<br/>Since I am investigating how &quot;generalized diatonic&quot; scales embed within<br/>ETs (I&apos;m not really into pure JI), I distinguish between &quot;chromatic&quot; and<br/>&quot;commatic&quot; unisons.  Within the system of diatonic/heptatonic (unisons<br/>[4 -1] and [-1 2]) scales embedded within 12TET (unisons [4 -1] and<br/>[0 3]), the commatic intervals are the ones that vanish in the ET, while<br/>the chromatic interval vanishes in the diatonic but _not_ the ET.  If<br/>you were considering the heptatonic scale independently of the 12TET<br/>gamut, of course, the [4 -1] would of course still vanish, which implies<br/>meantone.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@library.wustl.edu">manynote@library.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;How about that?
