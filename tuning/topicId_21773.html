You&apos;ll find it here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Ligon%20FFT/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Ligon%20FFT/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me know what you think Earthlings!</p><p>Really nice piece, Jacky.  Even my wife likes it, and she doesn&apos;t usually get<br/>alternately tuned stuff, nor is she a fan of the usual B&amp;D type music.  Earth<br/>Tones has a brightness to it; a bubbling, vigorous joy.</p><p>Tuning-wise, it feels natural to me.  I don&apos;t hear any of the awkward melodic<br/>intervals that I associate with JI (RI in this case?), nothing feels like a stretch.<br/>Everything is in its proper place, and dancing like the dickens.  In my imagination<br/>I see gnomes and subterranean spirits energetically dancing and working at the<br/>same time, as if the the two activities were naturally one and the same.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
