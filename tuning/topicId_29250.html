So I was thinking about taking the next step and buying a 19-tet<br/>guitar. Is that even a remote possibility or do I have to make it<br/>myself? I&apos;m not too good with the sort of mechanical tinkering<br/>involved, I&apos;d probably end up sawing the neck off somehow... ;-) So,<br/>lacking a place that can make me a 19-teT guitar, does anyone know of<br/>any good books/websites where I can read up on refretting a guitar<br/>without destroying it?</p><p>Thanks for any thoughts/pointers/advice...</p><p>Brian Szymanski<br/><a href="mailto:bks10@cornell.edu">bks10@cornell.edu</a></p></div><h3><a id=29252 href="#29252">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2001 9:49:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:xbrianskix@yahoo.com">xbrianskix@yahoo.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Howdy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been reading over the theory of 19-teT and it all makes sense to<br/>&gt; me...
