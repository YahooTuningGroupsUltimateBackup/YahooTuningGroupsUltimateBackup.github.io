Very good Kraig.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I just wanted to jump in and say that theses studies are going on and<br/>you can find results if you search around. SOme would say that the<br/>studies are politicized, but at least two show that the Jews,<br/>regardless of being Sephardic or Ashkenzi have more in common with<br/>each other (and the Kurds) than they do with the Palestinians who<br/>have more in common with the Arabs (meaning peoples of the Arabian<br/>peninsula).</p><p>I&apos;m sure there are studies which also show what Kraig said, and<br/>then there are those that try to show &quot;who are the true heirs to<br/>the Canaanites&quot;.</p><p>All of these, as well has archeological excavations etc, just<br/>continue to provide fodder for the &quot;we deserve it all because<br/>we were here first&quot; crowd.</p><p>Why can&apos;t we all just live together?</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
