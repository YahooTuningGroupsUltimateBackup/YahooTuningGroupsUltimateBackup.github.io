I actually argued with him over the phone back in 2000*! (One of<br/>my pet peeves: that being he seems to think inharmonic scales are just<br/>deviations from the JI model, etc.) I said he was stuck in his European-Arabic-Indian<br/>musical background and his rather off-putting insistence that a practical<br/>scale _must_ be singable or chantable. I quoted Hugo Ball at him just to get his<br/>anthropocentric goat (&quot;Noises ... are existentially more powerful than the<br/>human voice.&quot;)</p><p>    [*Kinda glad he didn&apos;t have a heartattack... or sumthin&apos;. I&apos;ve a bit o&apos;<br/>history of drivin&apos; some teachers to nervous breakdowns...]</p><p>&gt; Mathieu assumes  that each mode of the diatonic scale (in 12-equal) is<br/>heard as a<br/>&gt;different, idiosyncratically-shaped JI structure. And that &quot;comma<br/>&gt;pumps&quot; will be heard as JI progressions with one huge leap from one<br/>&gt;end of the lattice to another at some specific point in the<br/>&gt;progression. Both of these assumptions are highly unnecessary and<br/>&gt;misleading, I think, if one views temperament correctly.</p><p>    Honestly I don&apos;t _fully_ understand the above, but I think the jist of it<br/>all is also part of my arguement. Or rather my arguement is part of yours...</p><p>&gt;Monz&apos;s Tonalsoft software is really going to help people in this<br/>&gt;department, and probably for many practical ends as well.</p><p>    ::does his imitation of <a href="http://sluggyfreelance.com">sluggyfreelance.com</a>&apos;s Kikki the Ferret:: &quot;oh<br/>shiney shiney...&quot;<br/>    I just hope it&apos;s clunky-MacOS9-friendly ;)</p><p>&gt;Not to mention that Mathieu allows the significance of meantone to<br/>&gt;completely fall through the cracks, fostering the tired old &quot;JI vs.<br/>&gt;ET&quot; mentality, where easily 1/3 of his book could -- and should --<br/>&gt;have been devoted to meantone examples (just about anything from 1480-<br/>&gt;1780 would fit the bill).</p><p>    Yepyep, I am reaaally miffed he practically didn&apos;t even mention meantones<br/>- and in specific you would think he would like the 16th/17th C. Italian<br/>chromatic meantones and be totally ga-ga over the 17th C. French _temperaments<br/>ordinaire_!<br/>    And he addresses dronality very well (but not as in-depth as I would like<br/>or as far-ranging, i.e he is mainly concerned with augmented roots betraying<br/>his largely EuroIndian music theory bias)... but hardly anything on<br/>timbrality, i.e. tone-colour, _Klangfarbenmelodie_, etc.<br/>    IMHO tone-clusters are one of the last, true frontiers of chromaticism<br/>and the beginnings of the next, timbrality and dronality. And Mathieu<br/>practically dismisses secundal forms or doesn&apos;t consider it enough of musical importance<br/>or interest.</p><p>    But give the ol&apos; guy credit: he at least wrote of the &quot;Dark Side&quot; of<br/>music and has a whole chapter on symmetrical scales, modes of limited<br/>transposition, lil section on equal temperaments beyond 12tET (mostly based on Blackwood<br/>tho&apos;), &amp;, one of my fav subjects, the dissolution of tonality!
