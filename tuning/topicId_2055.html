For example: in the case of large dyads, maybe we<br/>&gt;&gt;should say that the dissonance decreases, and so does the consonance!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Exactly the thoughts I had to on reading Graham Breed&apos;s post. You could<br/>&gt;post this to the list.</p><p>I posted it right after I sent it to you.  I also posted my conclusions on<br/>the lattice metric stuff, which I am feeling pretty good about.</p><p>&gt;Except I don&apos;t remember Paul Erlich saying that consonance decreased, only<br/>&gt;that dissonance did.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember what Paul said about this.  But Graham&apos;s post seemed to<br/>indicate that they consider dissonance to _increase_ with span.</p><p>I proposed that maybe they meant that consonance decreases with span, as<br/>dissonance is obviously not increasing.  Follow?</p><p>&gt;Problem is, this complicates things, perhaps needlessly. I *can* convince<br/>&gt;myself to think of wide dyads as highly consonant. Maybe Graham can too.<br/>&gt;Anyway this confirms my resolve to only talk about DISSONANCE (for now),<br/>&gt;since we at least agree that wide dyads have low dissonance. Perhaps we<br/>&gt;could add another dimension at right-angles and call it DEGREE OF<br/>&gt;INTERACTION.</p><p>Hmm.  The way I read it, Graham and Erlich were saying wide dyads had high<br/>dissonance.  This does not fit the definition of dissonance that we&apos;ve been<br/>using.  So I suggested that maybe they meant wide dyads had low consonance.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean by DEGREE OF INTERACTION, and I&apos;m not sure my<br/>distinction between con and dis is a needless complication.  I could see<br/>consonance as a measure of ease of tuning by ear and dissonance as the<br/>subjective &quot;restlessness&quot; of an interval.  Something like...</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   name         width (cents)        consonance         dissonance<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>small dyads        15-200            mostly low         mostly high<br/>mediam dyads      270-1900             varies             varies<br/>large dyads       over 2000          mostly low         mostly low<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For small and medium sized dyads, they ought to be reciprocal.  But they<br/>both ought to get small for wide intervals.</p><p>&gt;I said it, and Paul E. accepted it. As a COMPLEXITY measure it goes on<br/>&gt;indefinitely (but no-one can directly hear COMPLEXITY), but as a DISSONANCE<br/>&gt;measure it fails after that. It&apos;s purely because when the numbers get that<br/>&gt;high you are too close to other lower numbered ratios and TOLERANCE comes<br/>&gt;into play. All COMPLEXITY measures run into TOLERANCE eventually, it&apos;s just<br/>&gt;that n+d seems to have a particularly simple rule for *when*.</p><p>Thanks!  I do recognize the need for tolerance.  Harmonic entropy seems to<br/>be the ideal tolerance metric, and maybe the ideal measure of what I call<br/>consonance above.  Sethares&apos; roughness stuff ought to take care of what I<br/>call dissonance.</p><p>I usually recognize the 19-limit as a safe and effective tolerance cutoff,<br/>and I am surprised that (n+d) would fail around the 9-limit.</p><p>&gt;This is another reason why 15/4 vs 12/5 is not a clearcut counterexample to<br/>&gt;n*d COMPLEXITY. Pauls original objection was to an octave-equivalent<br/>&gt;version of n*d (which no-one was proposing) where 15/8 vs 6/5 was a<br/>&gt;clearcut counterexample. But I&apos;m not interested in octave-equivalent<br/>&gt;complexity. Except perhaps partial octave equivalence via the prime<br/>&gt;weighting scheme I proposed, however that may be unnecessary.</p><p>Thanks.  I&apos;m down with this.</p><p>Just so we&apos;re cool, what exactly do we mean by complexity?  I&apos;d like to<br/>define it as a do-in-your-head measure that represents both roughness<br/>(dissonance) and tonalness (consonance) vectors.  What do you think?</p><p>On top of this basic definition, I think it ought to be octave-specific and<br/>as timbre-invariant as possible (working well enough on all generic<br/>harmonic timbres).  I&apos;d also like to have it as frequency-independent as<br/>possible.  Lastly, I don&apos;t think it should include tolerance.  I think<br/>tolerance is better treated afterwards with cents detuning or harmonic<br/>entropy.  I do like the 19-limit cutoff very much, and so I&apos;m not worried<br/>if the thing goes nuts with bigger numbers than 19 (that is, why would<br/>anybody feed it such a number?).</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=2062 href="#2062">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/1999 8:16:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Carl Lumma, in response to a message of mine that didn&apos;t make it to the<br/>list]:<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not sure what you mean by DEGREE OF INTERACTION, and I&apos;m not sure my<br/>&gt;distinction between con and dis is a needless complication.
