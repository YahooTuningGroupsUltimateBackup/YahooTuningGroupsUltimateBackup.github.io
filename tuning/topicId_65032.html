It may not be<br/>&gt; strict barbershop, but they are much closer to barbershop tradition,<br/>&gt; and have a lot in common with barbershop.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s more than a lot in common.  John Mills Sr. was in fact, a real singing barber with a barbershop in Ohio. He sang with the Four Kings of Harmony, a barbershop quartet by any definition of the term. His four sons started out in the thirties, and always included a number of traditional barbershop pieces in their concert repertoire. Their 1949 double record of barbershop standards is unorthodox by SPEBSQSA criterion -- light accompaniment, humming, solo verses etc. -- but that orthodoxy was not yet formulated. That &quot;orthodoxy&quot;, is in fact, a late 20th century performing style, and it&apos;s useful to hear it as such.</p><p>The greater distinctions that have to be noted are that the Mills Brothers were professionals, and as professionals, they never viewed the music they made  in terms of static criteria (which would not have made much sense in a professional context anyways -- they had to keep up with a marketplace and keep on renewing a market identity). But it also has to be said that the Mills brothers were African-American, and the SPEBSQSA, although integrated in some parts of the country (New York City, for example, where La Guardia was an enthusiastic barbershopper), was segregated, when not white-only in much of the country, consistantly tried, as an institution, to define the genre in terms that inevitably distanced it from African-American roots and practice.  Early rhythm and blues and doo-wop arts often cited the Mills brothers and other close harmony groups as influences. The contemporary SPEBSQSA singers and a cappella R&amp;B singers are equally legitimate successors to the same tradition.</p><p>While there will surely always be enthusiasts for a narrowly defined musical genre, there are close harmony singing traditions outside of the official and bureaucratic SPEBSQSA world, from African-American traditions to collegiate singing groups, and they ought not be left out of the discussion if the picture is to be complete.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=65177 href="#65177">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 1:23:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; SPEBSQSA ... consistantly tried, as an institution, to<br/>&gt; define the genre in terms that inevitably distanced it<br/>&gt; from African-American roots and practice.</p><p>What is the evidence for this?</p><p>&gt; While there will surely always be enthusiasts for a narrowly<br/>&gt; defined musical genre, there are close harmony singing<br/>&gt; traditions outside of the official and bureaucratic SPEBSQSA<br/>&gt; world, from African-American traditions to collegiate singing<br/>&gt; groups, and they ought not be left out of the discussion if<br/>&gt; the picture is to be complete.</p><p>Very true, but at the end of the day there&apos;s nothing like<br/>SPEBSQSA barbershop.
