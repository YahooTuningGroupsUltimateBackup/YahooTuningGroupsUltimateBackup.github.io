This also visits<br/>all tones in the scale and we don&apos;t need to take wrapping<br/>around the octave into account.<br/>Say we have two semitones of X and X+C cents, for example<br/>96 and 96+6=102 cents.<br/>Then each interval consists of some number of semitones of<br/>size X and some of size X+C, say nX + m(X+C). Rewrite this<br/>into (n+m)X + mC. Then n+m is the interval class. Then<br/>you see that for a particular interval class n+m is constant<br/>and m=0,1,2,etc. which is 0x6, 1x6, 2x6, etc. cents,<br/>the difference between the interval sizes is a multiple of<br/>6 cents.&quot;</p><p>The two sizes of interval for every interval class is in<br/>the definition of distributional evenness, so that answers<br/>half the question. Why the size difference is always the<br/>same, lies in the above, and you can also see that, because of<br/>the evenness, the number of semitones of each size in each interval<br/>never differs by more than one (from that in another interval<br/>of the same class).
