I knew there was something I liked about you besides your<br/>music. :-) Seriously, though, I am totally incompetent as a performer on<br/>conventional instruments. Even when I was younger and practiced an hour or<br/>so a day, I was never competitive as a flute player, although I enjoyed<br/>playing in the band and playing jazz. It&apos;s been over ten years since I even<br/>tried to play the thing; about the only performing I do these days is<br/>karaoke, at least until the smoke in the karaoke bar gets to me and I have<br/>to leave. If I am to make music at all, I need a computer. :-)</p><p>And you&apos;re right about most computer music not sounding appreciably better<br/>than the old Moogs. I can tell you why that is. The paradigm used in<br/>computer music programs is a lot like the paradigm of the Moog --<br/>oscillators, filters, noise generators, buses, reverb units and so on. To<br/>some extent, that is a necessary simplification to make computer music<br/>accessible at all to musicians ... the underlying mathematics of<br/>sampled-data systems and the mechanics of generating the sound samples are<br/>decidedly non-trivial and something like a &quot;patch panel&quot; is required to<br/>facilitate understanding.</p><p>As I said earlier, I have been studying computer music for nearly 40 years,<br/>and I prefer to build my own tools. And I think a &quot;music theory&quot; for<br/>computer music *will* emerge; I&apos;ve seen hints of it in Michael Gogins&apos;<br/>&quot;Silence&quot;, in the work on algorithmic composition since &quot;ILLIAC Suite&quot; and<br/>in the Audio Groups work at MIT that led to the MPEG-4 Structured Audio<br/>standard. But that&apos;s just me; I won&apos;t expect you to make computer music and<br/>hope that no one will expect me to learn to play the Diamond Marimba :-).<br/>--<br/>M.

It turned out to be a gross misunderstanding of statements made by its creator.  He designed it to &quot;eat&quot; sugar (you &quot;feed&quot; it sugar, it extracts energy from it to operate).  Someone had asked him if it could &quot;eat&quot; meat.  His reply was not at the moment, but it would not be impossible to modify the robot to do so.</p><p>Paolo<br/>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>.</p><p>Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at <a href="http://profiles.msn.com">http://profiles.msn.com</a>.</p></div><h3><a id=14764 href="#14764">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2000 10:30:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I read in the NY Times the other day (obviously the true source for<br/>&gt;all knowledge) that robots are now capable of designing and<br/>&gt;manufacturing OTHER robots from the &quot;ground up.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Of course, their engineering skills are a little on the primitive<br/>&gt;side...

Let me know off-list.</p><p>To avoid going too far OT, the interested person should check out<br/>Kurzweil&apos;s _The age of Spiritual Machines_.  I think he&apos;s wrong about<br/>what the stuff will be like, but I think he&apos;s right that it&apos;s coming<br/>(you can believe his particular time table as much as you believe his<br/>data on the number of switches in various brains).  For what it will be<br/>like, do a search for Mark Tilden.</p><p>To summarize, in the future we will probably be using a wide range of<br/>machines that make use of emergent phenomena -- everything from growing<br/>finished goods from the molecular level (diamond is a favorite) to<br/>thinking machines that, in my lifetime, may very well be our superiors.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
