Yet the results are almost the same as 53-tET&apos;s degrees:</p><p>0,4,5,8,9,13,14,17,18,22,23,26,27,30,31,35,36,39,40,44,45,48,49,52,53</p><p>With not so much a difference as a single cent. Thus, the comma-system is thought in terms of 53-tET.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Neil Haverstick<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 03 Ekim 2005 Pazartesi 18:36<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Question for Ozan</p><p>     Yo Ozan...thanks for the post, pardon this inquiry, might of missed this<br/>  definition earlier: the Arel-Ezgi tuning is 53/octave?

No, the G major just shows the pitches heard in the standard diapason. All Neys must read Rast as a C Major scale tuned to 5-limit default ratios.</p><p>Remember! Maqam Music perdes are relative frequencies and Rast is always the first degree (unless a semitone takes its place), which must be written and read as a G cleffed DO below the staff line by the Neys and similar Key Transposable instruments like the Clarinet, Trumpet, French Horn, etc...</p><p>It is pretty obvious that perde Rast is the first diatonical degree free from the diapason, and there is only one way to notate all the natural tones of the Ney as natural noteheads.</p><p>You play yourself the Ney, observe that the second harmonic is the lowest default for all Neys, and Rast is the first pitch thus produced with all the holes except ends closed. Below Rast (and Gevasht which is a semitone blown perpendicularly like Rast) the rest of the pitches behave like pedal tones all the way to Kaba Rast. That is why these are called &quot;Dem-Perdeler&quot;, or &quot;Breathy-Tones&quot;.</p><p>  What I don&apos;t understand (yet, my reading is still in<br/>  progress, hence this post), is where the 5/4 third and<br/>  the 15/8 seventh come from, as none of the major<br/>  theorists from al-Mausili to Ibn Sina has it.</p><p>No, but Safiyuddin had provided the Pythagorean equivalents for them seven centuries years ago.</p><p>  When were those ratios introduced? By Yekta?</p><p>Yes, except that I consider perde Huseyni to be 27/16 in Maqam Rast, and 5/3 in Maqam Segah. These ratios were re-introduced later by Ekrem Karadeniz, and probably by his elder colleague Abdulkadir Tore.</p><p>  Thanks for your patience,<br/>  Michael</p><p>My pleasure.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=67122 href="#67122">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@akjmusic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2006 9:07:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan,</p><p>I found a post a while back of yours that said you played some<br/>alternate tunings on a Yamaha P-200.
