In TD 184...</p><p>From Monz:<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve already surrendered -</p><p>Not necessary. I&apos;m a pacifist and don&apos;t wage war! These are just beliefs,<br/>albeit deeply held ones. And Monz, you&apos;ve posted enough that it is clear<br/>your heart is in the right place; hell, all of this causes questions for<br/>me, too.</p><p>&gt;We&apos;ve already got the guide to building the instruments,<br/>&gt;as long as _Genesis_ stays in print.</p><p>And, if you pick up Enclosure 3 (which is not inexpensive, though arguably<br/>indispensable) you can find a complete reproduction of his &quot;Manual&quot; for the<br/>instruments.</p><p>[Full title: &quot;MANUAL: On the Maintenance and Repair of -- and the Musical<br/>and Attitudinal Techniques for -- Some Putative Musical Instruments]</p><p>See? He even wants someone to know the *attitude* of performing, even as he<br/>is writing a book on the tuning and upkeep of the instruments. Was this guy<br/>classic a-r or what?</p><p>&gt;You know, I was thinking, with the limitation on performances<br/>&gt;of Partch&apos;s music which is the result of maintaining this<br/>&gt;position, what we really need in order to preserve it, is<br/>&gt;publication of good, quality scores of his compositions.<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve tried to read the info at the Schott website about<br/>&gt;the supposed publication of Partch scores, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;seem to exist there anymore.  I had trouble finding it anyway.</p><p>I will endeavor to find more information out about the eventual timeline<br/>and manner of publication of the scores. It may take a bit, but I&apos;ll put<br/>notice to everyone here of anything I find. And Joe, just so you know,<br/>there have been others on the list in the past that have been interested in<br/>&apos;study scores&apos; to Partch, so it might be collaborative, I don&apos;t know. As I<br/>understand it, the rights to the scores are held by someone, either<br/>Schott-International or someone else. I&apos;ll check.</p><p>From Pat Pagano:<br/>&gt;And why did the HPF not maintain said copyrights to<br/>&gt;prevent stuff like this.</p><p>Human error. And the completely chaotic manner that Partch kept records,<br/>when he kept them. Virtually all of the transcriptions have been done with<br/>the early versions of the pieces (like Barstow) that had lapsed copyright,<br/>or not renewed. It is entirely possible that Partch, having moved on to a<br/>newer &apos;arrangement&apos; (such as U.S. Highball, which added more instruments in<br/>the late 40&apos;s/early 50&apos;s) didn&apos;t see a need to renew copyrights on pieces<br/>he didn&apos;t plan on playing. Probably didn&apos;t foresee all this.</p><p>Or didn&apos;t care...that would be *just* like Harry!</p><p>There are also people that have done their own &apos;arrangements&apos; by using<br/>manuscripts from libraries, etc., to put together a version. This is<br/>neither better or worse, it just smells differently to me.</p><p>[that was mild humor. or humour.]</p><p>&gt;And Jon I admit Enclosure 2 is nice but do we really<br/>&gt;need a side of &quot;harry&apos;s Wake&quot; I mean really....that makes me question the<br/>&gt;motivation of all parties concerned. Everyone is cashing in on his genius.</p><p>Pat, you must be careful when you say things like this: I can think of no<br/>one who has worked more closely with the estate of HP, with all of Partch&apos;s<br/>colleagues and friends, and worked harder to attempt to extend an<br/>understanding of Partch in as complete a manner as is possible -- I can<br/>think of no one who would do this except Philip Blackburn, creator of the<br/>&quot;Enclosures&quot; series. Almost single-handedly, through 5 huge projects he has<br/>brought *enormous* resources to light for the study of both Partch&apos;s work<br/>and his life, and many would agree that few artists have so intermingled<br/>their life and their work as Partch did (with good and bad implications).</p><p>On Enc2 I happen to have a real issue with the inclusion of &quot;Bitter Music&quot;,<br/>but that is just me and I&apos;m happy to overlook it. The inclusion of the<br/>taped reminiscences (sp?) from the wake gathers thoughts about Partch from<br/>close friends and colleagues (Lou Harrison, Danlee Mitchell, etc.) and<br/>sheds light on the closing chapter of his life. It&apos;s pretty silly of us to<br/>carp about either section of the discs when you get his discourse on tuning<br/>(with examples!), archival recordings, erudite notes... etc.</p><p>But my final point is this: Dr. Blackburn (who would hate me calling him<br/>that) has done this all with grant money and the like, and is not &apos;cashing<br/>in&apos; on Partch. On the contrary, he has worked hard to see that all of these<br/>efforts are done so that there is a more thorough understanding of just<br/>what Partch was about.</p><p>I recorded &quot;The Bewitched&quot; live in Cologne in 1980. The recording, never<br/>heard by us after the performance, became mired in legal muck and then was<br/>never heard from again. Years passed. I wondered if it was as good an<br/>evening as I remembered. Years passed again, and then Blackburn got on the<br/>case. Months of sleuthing, cajoling, corresponding, discussing. Much more<br/>than I would even know about.</p><p>Late last year, 18 years after the fact, the recording was finally released<br/>on Enclosure 5, along with the long dormant Yeats/Mills College &quot;Oedipus&quot;.<br/>Due entirely to the efforts of Philip Blackburn.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the situation for you.</p><p>&gt;So are we all by using his concepts in our musics and calling them our own<br/>&gt;We are all guilty</p><p>Absolutely not. The only thing that one would feel guilty about is if they<br/>merely &apos;aped&apos; Partch. He hoped to inspire new creations -- it was only<br/>those who would call themselves his &quot;students&quot; that he would have &quot;happily<br/>strangled&quot;.</p><p>Harry would probably kick my ass for doing what I&apos;m doing.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.

It may take a<br/>&gt; bit, but I&apos;ll put notice to everyone here of anything I find.</p><p>The thing that really concerns me regarding any possible<br/>publication of Partch&apos;s scores is that I&apos;ve gotten wind of<br/>plans to use Ben Johnston&apos;s notation, and I think this is wrong.</p><p>(As I said, I was unable to get any details of Schott&apos;s<br/>proposed publication, but I remember last year A&amp;R Editions<br/>was talking about publishing _Barstow_ in Johnston&apos;s notation.)</p><p>I&apos;ve posted here recently on the defects (IMO) of this notation,<br/>at least as a standard for music other than Johnston&apos;s own<br/>(after all, what can we say about Johnston using it for his<br/>own scores, other than the general criticism?).</p><p>I certainly feel that a more rigorously prime-based notation<br/>(such as my own or Daniel Wolf&apos;s) would be far superior to<br/>represent Partch&apos;s music (or any JI scores, for that matter)<br/>in staff-notation.</p><p>BTW, I&apos;m glad that &apos;Harry&apos;s Wake&apos; was included on the CD set,<br/>if only for the fact that I got to hear the drunken Partch<br/>playing Chopin on the piano.  Even with the bad quality of<br/>the recording (and Harry&apos;s condition), his feeling for the<br/>corporeality of Chopin&apos;s music comes shining thru.</p><p>And I disagree with you, Jon, about the inclusion of _Bitter<br/>Music_.  While I certainly gain much more from reading the<br/>book than from listening to this performance, I still think<br/>it was worth including, if only for the ability to hear what<br/>those piano-score musical parts sound like, as opposed to<br/>the very &apos;Partchian&apos; (i.e., microtonal) sound that was in my<br/>head as I read.</p><p>Also, IMO, the world would be a lesser place without<br/>_While My Heart Keeps Beating Time_ in it.  There have<br/>been many days when that song rambles around in my mind<br/>for hours.</p><p>Joseph L.
