Also on this concert is a work by<br/>Frederic Rzewski which is *certainly* bound to be microtonal, since<br/>it involves banging on flower pots!  So I&apos;m including the Press<br/>Release below!:</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>The Composers Concordance ushers in the new season in full Autumnal<br/>spirit with our first concert of 2007-2008 featuring unusual winds,<br/>song and flower pots.  The concert will take place Friday November 9,<br/>2007, 8PM at the Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, NYC.</p><p>Esther Lamneck will be performing two works for the national<br/>instrument of Hungary, the t&aacute;rogat&oacute; - an untamed serpent-like<br/>woodwind related to the clarinet.  She will be performing Through a<br/>Glass by Dary John Mizelle and a special tribute to our beloved<br/>colleague Ron Mazurek, who died this last Spring.  We are dedicating<br/>our November 9th concert to the memory of Ron and will feature his<br/>Shadows, a work for t&aacute;rogat&oacute; and electronic sound which shows his<br/>uncanny mastery of the electronic medium.</p><p>New music flutists Erin Lesser and Roberta Michel will perform 3<br/>Duets for 2 Flutes by our honored mentor Otto Luening, who shepherded<br/>our group into existence during the final years of his 96-year life.</p><p>New music violist Beth Meyers will navigate a work by young composer,<br/>Ed Rosenberg, &quot;hot off the press&quot; which showcases the extremes and<br/>expressive possibilities of Rosenberg&apos;s unique post-minimal/maximal<br/>musical aesthetic.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson&apos;s Windjammer for woodwind quintet will be performed,<br/>and Joelle Wallach takes us on a journey of songs about love and<br/>relationships:  platonic, funny, funky and spiritual, with soprano<br/>Janice Hall.</p><p>A flower pot conspiracy is in the works with our concluding piece by<br/>famed piano virtuoso and instigator Frederic Rzewski, To the Earth.<br/>This piece abandons traditional instruments for the more ecologically<br/>correct sound-producting medium: the flower pot.  Percussionist Peter<br/>Jarvis will tap and rap and chant over several of these talismanic<br/>objects, concluding the concert and leading us into what should be a<br/>joyous and earthy reception.</p><p>Tickets are $12, $10 students/seniors.  TDF accepted.  Tickets can<br/>now be purchased in advance online:  <a href="http://www.composersconcordance.org">www.composersconcordance.org</a>.<br/>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p></div>
