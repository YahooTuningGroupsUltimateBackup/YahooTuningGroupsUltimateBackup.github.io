The chorale texture of the strings<br/>in _The Unanswered Question_ is can be easily heard as a single coherent<br/>unit, with a tonal, triadic character.  A tuning in either pythagorean<br/>(Johnny Reinhard&apos;s choice -- where the triadic resolutions will never really<br/>resolve) or 5-limit JI (which I&apos;d like to hear someday) is completely<br/>plausible.</p><p>In some of his most visionary works (esp. TUQ, the 4th Symphony, the Second<br/>Orchestral Set), Ives uses several topoi simultaneously, suggesting<br/>alternative intonations as a means of better projecting the individual topoi.<br/>(This projection is paralleled by the spatial assignments in TUQ). In many<br/>cases, the material in a given topos strongly suggests a particular<br/>intonation, in others, particularly the more chromatic, the possibilities are<br/>much wider. I isolate the chromatic materials here because Ives&apos; usage of<br/>chromaticism is quite varied. In some cases, he uses a total chromatic in an<br/>atonal or proto-atonal way, in others more traditionally as a melodic<br/>diminution of basically diatonic music, and in still other cases, his<br/>chromaticism suggests an extended harmony implying representions of<br/>ever-higher partial tones.</p></div><h3><a id=5688 href="#5688">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>10/25/1999 5:45:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Pythagorean is Ives&apos;s choice, no one elses.  Wanting to hear Ives in Just<br/>Intonation or even 22-tone equal temperament would be a choice.  To say that<br/>C# is higher than Db is key to Ives&apos;s tuning conceptual model.</p><p>Question:  how would a B# be an eighthtone higher than a C natural in just<br/>intonation?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=5697 href="#5697">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
