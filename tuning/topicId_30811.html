The reviewer fails<br/>to mention any of these supposed forms. The Maqam is unquestionably the<br/>most universal practice throughout the Arabic world so it is unclear to<br/>what he is speaking. Regardless the author of this review fails to<br/>produces any specifics much less produce any credentials that he himself<br/>is knowledgeable about the myriad of music found in this area. I imagine<br/>Toumi must have recorded the UNESCO recordings in the 19th century. Also<br/>forms have nothing to do with tunings. If 24 ET is the dominant tuning<br/>then maybe we should tell Cam  that all his measurements are wrong and a<br/>waste of time.<br/> Sad that one can accuse others as dismissing whole subcultures as if<br/>they re an expert about such matters.
