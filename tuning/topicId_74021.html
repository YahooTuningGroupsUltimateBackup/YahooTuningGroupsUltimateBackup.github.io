This will be brought to light in a future episode of the<br/>remarkable story of how the Sagittal notation was developed.  As<br/>demonstrated time and again, truth is indeed much stranger (and much<br/>more interesting) than fiction.</p><p>In the meantime, those not familiar with the story can read about it<br/>from the very beginning:<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/GiftOfTheGods.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/GiftOfTheGods.htm</a><br/>and those who have not yet read the latest (brief) update to which<br/>you refer will find it here:<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/FinalEpisode.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/FinalEpisode.htm</a></p><p>And whatever the case, please stay tuned. (pun intended).</p><p>--&quot;George&quot;</p></div>
