All of the instruments have 8 tubes. On the jegogan<br/>and the two calungs tuned an octave above them, the 4 right-hand tubes<br/>duplicate the tones of those on the left, enabling the players to play<br/>rolling melodies by alternating left and right hand strokes between notes<br/>of the same pitch.&quot; Michael Tenzer, _Balinese Music_ (ISBN 0-945971-30-3),<br/>p. 91-92)</p><p>In the few recordings I&apos;ve heard, the jegog scale sounds similar to a<br/>4:5:6:7 chord. Pelog scales in general are quite variable, so there isn&apos;t a<br/>single description that would apply to all of them, but in general they<br/>consist of 7 unequally spaced notes, with two of the steps between notes<br/>more or less larger than the other five, or (more typically), a five-note<br/>subset of this tuning. Dividing the octave into nine equal steps (9-ET)<br/>gives a rough approximation to a general pelog scale (omitting the fourth<br/>and ninth steps in the 9-note scale), but no actual pelog scale is that<br/>regular. The phrygian mode is another rough approximation; a typical 5-note<br/>pelog might be something like D Eb F A Bb (although the interval between<br/>&quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; in this scale is usually wider than the interval between &quot;G&quot;<br/>and &quot;A&quot;, so it doesn&apos;t map well to a meantone tuning). But some pelog<br/>tunings sound more like the Japanese mode &quot;hirajoshi&quot; (D E F A Bb) than the<br/>phrygian mode, and others split the minor third into roughly equal parts.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
