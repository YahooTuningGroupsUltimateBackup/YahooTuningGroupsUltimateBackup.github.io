I&apos;m trying to figure out the best workflow for this. I&apos;ve completed one piece in this style already but my workflow was rather cumbersome. My new idea is to try to explore soft-synths that allow Scala tuning file imports.<br/> But while learning Scala I&apos;ve run into a bit of a conundrum. The FFT analysis of a sound will give me a list for the partials for a sound. This is not really a scale per-se, but a list of frequencies. Scala seems made more for building a set of scales that repeat at x-number of notes, but can it also be used to generate a set of frequencies for every note of the scale? In other words a low D might be 23 cents sharp but a D a few octaves up might be 250 cents flat, so I would need to define all of the notes on the keyboard in this way.<br/> I believe that you can make a scale in Scala any arbitrary size, so could I theoretically make one that is 88 keys wide and define each note? I believe so but I&apos;m not sure exactly how to go about this. I&apos;d love any insights into using Scala for this approach and also if there&apos;s a better tool or idea out there please let me know!<br/> I&apos;m not sure if this board has dealt much with spectral music but I&apos;m pretty sure there are some Scala experts amongst you.<br/> Thanks so much,<br/> Ben</p></div><h3><a id=106512 href="#106512">ðŸ”—</a>gedankenwelt94@...</h3><span>12/20/2015 12:38:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, and a late welcome! :)</p><p> I don&apos;t have much experience with custom periods or non-periodic scales in scala, but afaIk scala always uses the last interval as a period. So if you have an 88-note scale, you can specify all notes as intervals (except 1/1, which is always assumed and should be omitted). The last interval will serve as a period, but you can just define the 87 notes that are not 1/1, and ignore everything beyond, pretending the scale is non-periodic.</p><p> P.S.: As you probably noticed, these yahoo message boards aren&apos;t very active anymore. I think most people (not including me) are on facebook, so if you&apos;re looking for a more active community, you can give it a try.
