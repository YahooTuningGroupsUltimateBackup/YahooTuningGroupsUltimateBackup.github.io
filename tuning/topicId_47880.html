(just joking...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seriously, I await further developments.  My mind is entirely<br/>open...<br/>&gt; in fact, as some have noticed, a bit *too* open...</p><p>Okay, here it is in a nutshell.  Dave and I have agreed on a<br/>modification for the 7-comma sagittal symbol pair, the one used for<br/>2deg72, in order to differentiate it more from the 5-comma symbol<br/>pair (for 1deg72) in appearance.  We believe that we&apos;ve succeeded in<br/>our efforts (and have also gathered some evidence to support that),<br/>but (because of certain things you have said) we have reason to<br/>believe that there may still not be enough of a difference to satisfy<br/>you.</p><p>Anyway, we&apos;re setting that question aside for now.  The outcome will<br/>have no effect on the notation of a lot of ETs, since there are many<br/>that can be notated without using both pairs of symbols, and we<br/>expect that others will want to use sagittal notation for that<br/>purpose (or that there might be others that may happen to disagree<br/>with you and will want to use sagittal for applications that do use<br/>*both* pairs of symbols).</p><p>Keeping these possibilities in mind, Dave agrees with me (yes, we&apos;ve<br/>discussed this off-list since yesterday&apos;s postings) that it&apos;s helpful<br/>for everyone involved if we can avoid having symbols in your HEWM<br/>implementation and in sagittal that do not use the *same* symbols to<br/>mean completely different things.  The symbols for 72-ET in the two<br/>notations already have two things in common:</p><p>1) The 1deg72 symbols clarify Bosanquet&apos;s up and down slashes, / and<br/>\, but by different means; and<br/>2) The 3deg72 symbol (quartertone arrow, which usage is already well<br/>established) is the same for both.</p><p>The problem is that the Sims symbol for 2deg72 is virtually identical<br/>to the sagittal 5-comma (or 1deg-72) symbol, so your carrying that<br/>over into HEWM would result in all sorts of confusion for those who<br/>wished (or were required) to read parts (on one occasion) containing<br/>your HEWM graphics and (on another occasion) parts written in<br/>sagittal notation.  It&apos;s unfortunate that Ezra Sims chose a a half-<br/>arrow symbol with an upward sloping line to represent (in 72) a 7-<br/>comma-up instead of a 5-comma-up (or for that matter, a full arrow to<br/>represent 1deg72 instead of a quartertone, in utter disregard of<br/>established precedents), but there&apos;s nothing we (who seek to notate<br/>multiple tunings using the best ideas) can do about that now but walk<br/>away from it.</p><p>Inasmuch as you have already discarded the Sims 1deg and 3deg<br/>symbols, I don&apos;t think that it would be inappropriate to make a<br/>complete break and use something besides the Sims 2deg72 symbol for<br/>that purpose.  In fact, I notice that Monz just said that he would<br/>prefer something having less of a resemblance to the quartertone<br/>arrows (message #47947):</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; in my scores, i have used both the actual &lt; and &gt; symbols,<br/>&gt; and also the half-arrows pointing down and up respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve generally preferred the half-arrows for actual score<br/>&gt; notation, but from constant use of &lt; and &gt; in emails it&apos;s<br/>&gt; become easier for me to use them in scores as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; another advantage they have is that they&apos;re more clearly<br/>&gt; differentiated from the regular arrows which go with the<br/>&gt; quarter-tone, but even here, i&apos;ve occassionally begun<br/>&gt; using the v and ^ symbols (i.e., the arrow-tops) in scores,<br/>&gt; without the arrow-stems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>Here&apos;s the bottom line -- what I call the 2/3 solution.

But it&apos;s not<br/>ready yet.</p><p>&gt; ... actually, i think it&apos;s high time i put a &quot;sagittal&quot;<br/>&gt; definition into the Tuning Dictionary.  can you send or<br/>&gt; point me to graphics and explanations?</p><p>Here&apos;s a possible definition:</p><p>The word &quot;sagittal&quot; (pronounced &quot;SAJ-i-tl&quot;) means &quot;arrow-like&quot;. Think<br/>of Sagittarius the archer.</p><p>The Sagittal notation system is a comprehensive system for notating<br/>musical pitch in all possible scales and tunings - a universal set of<br/>microtonal accidentals, equally suited to extended just intonation,<br/>equal divisions of whatever, and anything in between. It is called<br/>Sagittal because it uses various arrow-like symbols, pointing up or<br/>down to indicate raising or lowering of pitch.</p><p>Sagittal was developed by George Secor and Dave Keenan, with a major<br/>early contribution from Gene Ward Smith, and in cooperation with many<br/>others on the Yahoo Groups tuning and tuning-math.</p><p>-end of definition-</p><p>As for graphics and explanations, we&apos;re still working on them and<br/>you&apos;ll eventually be able to direct people to a sagittal website.</p></div><h3>George D.

If<br/>newcomers to microtonality see a score with a notation that looks<br/>professional in quality, then I think that they are likely to come<br/>away with the impression that ours is a movement to be taken<br/>seriously.</p><p>--George</p></div>
