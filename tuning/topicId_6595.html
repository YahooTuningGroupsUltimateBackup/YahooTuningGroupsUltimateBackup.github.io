There exists a clear visceral superiority that results from the<br/>&gt;correct match of instrument to piece.</p><p>What if, upon hearing a composition for, say, solo piano, you were to<br/>imagine that the piece would sound much better for soprano and guitar.<br/>Perhaps the composer even had that combination in mind, but didn&apos;t play the<br/>guitar and didn&apos;t have a soprano who could do what he wanted but did play<br/>the piano? Or perhaps he had a market for his piano works and knew that the<br/>composition could sell if written for the piano? In such a case, what would<br/>be a faithful rendition? I have several such works in mind, one of which is<br/>Debussy&apos;s &quot;La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin&quot; which will be on my forthcoming CD,<br/>so you&apos;ll be able to judge for yourself. The original key of Gb is of<br/>course not appropraite for guitar, but right next to it is the key of G<br/>which allows the guitarist to take advantage of the open E and A bass<br/>strings as well as the open G triad on strings 2, 3, and 4 which is so<br/>pretty when played with harmonics. In arranging this piece for guitar and<br/>soprano I was amazed at how little I had to change any voicings, and how so<br/>many of the voicings are very standard for guitar. My arrangement is almost<br/>a literal transcription (and transpositon) that occasionally omits a<br/>doubled note.</p><p>I suspect that Debussy did have soprano and guitar in mind, and that his<br/>publication of the work for solo piano is actually an arrangement of the<br/>work intended for soprano and guitar. The entire basis of my conjecture is<br/>the success of my arrangement and performance. Towards the end of the piece<br/>it is so thrilling to hear a soprano (Raissa Dorff on my CD) repeat the<br/>first theme an octave higher, starting on a high D after I play three<br/>chords (Am9, D, C) that almost completely fade away by the time she starts<br/>to sing. That&apos;s a thrill because it is risky to sing such a passage with<br/>such minimal accompaniment, and to do so so delicately. The same passage<br/>sounds quite pretty on the piano, but I don&apos;t think a pianist can ever<br/>create the same sense of ease through danger that a soprano can. (Pianists,<br/>that is exactly what I think you ought to aim at in that passage!)</p><p>Do any of you know whether Debussy played guitar, or consulted with a<br/>guitarist in writing &quot;La Fille...&quot;? Could any of you provide any sort of<br/>support for my hypothesis? I would be thrilled to learn of such evidence.<br/>But if there is none forthcoming or even if someone proves that Debussy<br/>detested the combination of soprano and guitar, it won&apos;t stop me from from<br/>performing the piece that way. When you hear it on my CD I hope that you&apos;ll<br/>understand why.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal quintet,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill Evans, Ennio and<br/>Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl Zindars.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=6637 href="#6637">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/5/1999 4:54:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Instrument arrangements are sort of the inverse of the issue we&apos;ve been<br/>discussing.

It is<br/>exciting and daunting to respond.  As to my ear, well like many composers I<br/>can hear interval relationships in my head from which I can draw<br/>compositions.  I do not have perfect pitch.

Ives was<br/>grappling with what he thought was the need for accuracy and refinement in<br/>thematic matters.  He was actually searching for a sensible way out of the<br/>procrustean bed the diatonic system and its notation had become, when<br/>weighted down by the responsibility of explaining chromatic developments.&quot;<br/>(Baron &quot;George Ives&apos;s Essay in Music Theory, 249)</p><p>An example of George Ives&apos;s really listening is his frank discussion on the<br/>7th harmonic: &quot;This 7th note produces what all musicians call a dissonance by<br/>sounds in some cases to me only like a partial dissonance and is used so much<br/>that we get used to it and treat it as if it were as much of a consonance as<br/>our other tones.&quot;<br/>(p. 248)</p><p>In 1969 Peter Yates, in a lecture entitled &quot;Microtonality&quot; presented a case<br/>for accepting that Charles Ives moved past 12TET into what he called an<br/>&quot;acoustic plan,&quot; as described in the previously posted letter to his music<br/>publishers.    Yates argued that a composer needn&apos;t &quot;be reduced to a bare 12<br/>tones, which for lack of an acoustically correct referrent he cannot<br/>effectively extend in the manner of Bartok, Ruggles, and Ives.&quot;  Yates offers<br/>an interesting speculation: &quot;It is in part for this reason that Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>composition remained ambiguously between the true emancipated dissonance of<br/>his theory and traditional harmony.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6693 href="#6693">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1999 7:16:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Who&apos;s &quot;we&quot;?

It&apos;s bad enough that laws have declared that<br/>&gt;after x years, a musical work belongs to the &quot;public domain&quot;, although<br/>&gt;said public may never have given a damn in support of the composer&apos;s<br/>&gt;work. (If I were a painter or sculpture, at least there is a solid<br/>&gt;object which I can sell to whomever or keep (and hand down to my<br/>&gt;children) as I pleased.)</p><p>I find your analogy lacking.  There is only one instance of a scuplture,<br/>but music can be performed many times at the same time in different<br/>places.  Thus a composer&apos;s potential income before a work falls into<br/>public domain far exceeds that of a sculptor.  I have heard that Paul<br/>McCartney, who has written at most a few dozen short songs, is buying up<br/>large chunks of Scotland on his earnings.</p><p>(As an aside, it would seem that MANY artists have recorded McCartney&apos;s<br/>works with a huge amount of individual artistic license, and, unless<br/>I&apos;ve missed it, he does not find this a terrible travesty).</p><p>&gt;Even worse is the attitude by players or<br/>&gt;listeners that they are doing the composer such a great service by<br/>&gt;listening to her work that they should not have to be compensated for<br/>&gt;the work of producing the work.  Worst of all is when players decide<br/>&gt;that, in return for granting the composer the service of playing the<br/>&gt;music, it is played only with extensive recomposition: new tunings,<br/>&gt;timbres, etc..</p><p>Oh, those NAUGHTY players: do they DARE inject their own musical<br/>sensibilities into a performance?  We will pummel them until they<br/>behave!  Everything must be EXACTLY as originally conceived!!</p><p>&gt;I do believe there is a place for visionary transcription or<br/>&gt;recomposition: Stravinsky&apos;s Pergolesi, Partch&apos;s Yaquis or von<br/>&gt;Schweinitz&apos;s Mozart are all visionary. Mahler&apos;s reorchestrations of<br/>&gt;Schumann are better than the originals, and I will never cease to be<br/>&gt;amazed by Glenn Gould&apos;s Bach (piano and all).  But this has got to be<br/>&gt;done with honesty about the nature of the re-composition, convincing<br/>&gt;rationale for the critique implied by the project, and enough touch of<br/>&gt;inspiration or virtuosity that discussion is unnecessary.</p><p>I really have to laugh at this, sorry Dan.  You graciously &quot;allow&quot;<br/>those who have already proven themselves in your eyes the right to have<br/>done what they&apos;ve done, but evidently, if you had been there, before<br/>these people proved themselves (in your eyes), you would have done your<br/>best to explain to them that they had no right to do it!</p><p>Either that, or you&apos;re saying that, if any discussion comes up, that<br/>fact in and of itself proves the unworthiness of a project, and<br/>presumably the person in question will cease and desist immediately<br/>upon notification of your (or anyone&apos;s) disapproval.</p><p>At the risk of oversimplification, I would say that this attitude is at<br/>the heart of what is wrong with &quot;serious&quot; music today - it&apos;s way, WAY<br/>too rigidified.  We&apos;ve cast the greats into petrified stone, and we<br/>scream at anyone who doesn&apos;t want to go along.  No wonder classical<br/>orchestras are going broke - it&apos;s like death to be at a concert; the joy<br/>has all but been squeezed out of the music.</p><p>Sorry, guys, but I will not go along.  I intend to do what I do simply<br/>because it delights my ears (and, it would seem, not only mine alone!).<br/>I do not say that I have found the perfect methods; there are a wealth<br/>of refinements still to come.
