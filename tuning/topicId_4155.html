It&apos;s a<br/>self-tightening knot that gets tighter as the line is<br/>stressed, yet is still relatively easy to untie.  It&apos;s<br/>explained with diagrams in the little leaflets that are<br/>included with most packages of monofilament line.  Warning:<br/>new non-mono type fishing lines are very popular right now<br/>(Spiderwire, Fusion, etc.).  Be sure the package you get<br/>states that it is monofiliment line.  Seems like a heavy and<br/>thick grade (often stated in terms of &quot;pound test&quot; where<br/>greater number is thicker) should work better than thin<br/>line, though you might need thinner for the upper frets.  If<br/>you break it, it means you almost caught one that was at<br/>least half the rated weight of your line!</p><p>David Finnamore</p><p>P. S.

If<br/>someone asks you what&apos;s working, just say, &quot;I ain&apos;t had much<br/>luck lately, how &apos;bout chew?&quot; then nod thoughtfully at their<br/>response.
