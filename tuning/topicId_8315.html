This makes a lot of sense, in fact, it should be<br/>&gt; almost self-evident, but I must confess I&apos;d never even thought<br/>&gt; about it before...</p><p>Indeed, I never had either.  Thanks from me too, Daniel.</p><p>But I&apos;m familiar with this idea in connection with first the<br/>loss, and then the rediscovery, of ancient Greek tunings in<br/>Western Europe.</p><p>The Germanic invasions of c 400-500 AD pretty much wiped out<br/>all the ancient knowledge that the Romans had preserved,<br/>the major exception (as regards music-theory) being Boethius,<br/>who was a subject of Theodoric, the Ostrogothic king of Italy.<br/>But knowledge of Boethius&apos;s book also disappeared for a while<br/>while nearly everyone in Europe became illiterate.</p><p>Of course, the conquering Germanic tribes had ancient knowledge<br/>in their own traditions, which from this point on became a<br/>major factor in the evolution of ideas all over Europe, possibly<br/>extending even into northern Africa (the Vandal kingdom).</p><p>Charlemagne (c 750-800), who had good diplomatic ties with the<br/>Byzantine (i.e., Greek) Empire, Persia, and the Baghdad Caliphate,<br/>and who knew how important education was, began to bring some<br/>of the Greek learning back into Europe - some of it filtered<br/>thru the Arab scholars.  Our modern Euro-centric music-theory<br/>begins with the Franks and continues in an unbroken line<br/>to today.</p><p>There was another &apos;Dark Age&apos; after Charlemagne&apos;s death, as<br/>the Frankish empire was broken up again into petty kingdoms<br/>headed by various of his descendants fighting against one<br/>another for power, but the candle was not quite as fully<br/>extinguished as it had been a few centuries before.<br/>Music-theory, in particular, continued to be a discipline<br/>that was subject to much investigation; Hucbald and<br/>Guido d&apos;Arezzo especially come to mind.</p><p>Then during the Crusades, soldiers coming back to Europe<br/>brought with them many treasures of the &apos;Holy Land&apos;, including<br/>ancient Greek and Arabic music-theory treatises.  This was<br/>also the time of the establishment of the Sorbonne in Paris,<br/>and the development of the musical Ars Nova.</p><p>The sack of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 resulted in<br/>the exodus of Greek scholars (mainly into Persia and Italy),<br/>and Gutenburg&apos;s invention of the printing press happened<br/>around the same time.  These two events are mainly what really<br/>got the Renaissance going into full swing.  Thus the strong<br/>interest of so many medieval European music-theorists in the<br/>ancient Greek tunings.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t surprise me at all that during the Baroque,<br/>Austrian musicians would adhere to meantone during a time<br/>that northern German provinces would move beyond it and explore<br/>well-temperaments.  The religious difference alone would seem<br/>to me to argue in favor of Catholic Austria maintaining older<br/>traditions while Protestant Germany was more progressive.</p><p>To a large extent, ideas and practices concerning tuning<br/>have been disseminated in patterns that can be revealed<br/>by a study of historical political and cultural events.</p><p>&gt; [Johnny Reinhard, TD 520.6]<br/>&gt; BTW, Leopold Mozart recommends Werckmeister for tuning in<br/>&gt; his classic book on violin playing.</p><p>Then, of course, there&apos;s always the fact that an inidividual<br/>is capable of bucking the trend.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

The Austrian empire under Joseph II was more<br/>progressive in many aspects, especially in the anti-clericalism, reform of<br/>state institutions, etc. than any of the small states in Northern Germany.<br/>(Many reforms did not, however, outlive him).  In contrast, the brand of<br/>Lutheranism practiced by Bach was, in some regards, not dissimilar to &quot;high<br/>church&quot; Anglicanism.  That Handel was able to function as a composer of<br/>scared music in lutheran, roman catholic and anglican state churches<br/>illustrates a certain fluidity in religious identity. That said, protestant<br/>church music did not get played in catholic churches (and vice versa),<br/>whatever the ideological environment, and sacred music by Bach would not<br/>have been played by Mozart in catholic services.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2000 12:20:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Daniel Wolf, TD 521.6]<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be rather cautious in tracing tuning systems in terms<br/>&gt; of ethnic movements or political history.
