One of my goals<br/>&gt;as a musician is to train myself to hear intervals with such precision that<br/>&gt;I can avoid these triggering mechanisms. I find absolutely nothing<br/>&gt;attractive in the idea that my listening is essentially a programmed<br/>&gt;response to such conditioning.</p><p>My point was that perhaps our brain/minds can only really respond to JI<br/>intervals, and the et intervals that Daniel wants to hear for themselves,<br/>and not as JI signifiers, are at best irrational approximations of high<br/>number ratios. So I used 635/504 as an example (today in a post Herman<br/>Miller pointed out 63/50 as a lower approximation) of the kind of JI ratio<br/>that one would have to be able to hear to experience 400c as JI without it<br/>being a signifier of 5/4. Since it seems that the point of contention as to<br/>hearability is somwhere between 13 and 19, Id say that hearing even 63/50<br/>as a ratio is beyond our ears at present, let alone 635/504. Given the<br/>possibility of some kind of historical progressive exploration of higher<br/>ratios (like Partch and others suggest), a whimsical possiblility is that<br/>someday, in the far future, or maybe in a galaxy far far away, our remote<br/>ancestors will have progressed up the series to the point where they can<br/>hear these ratios as themselves. Now I am also aware that materialistic<br/>Darwinism only uses the word &quot;evolution&quot; in a limited sense, hence Pauls<br/>comment about survival of the fittest. Nevertheless, a more broad<br/>definition of evolution can apply to the arts at least in the sense of<br/>building upon what previous generations have accomplished.</p><p>I see where I may seem to be contradicting myself: first I say that 400c is<br/>distinguishable from 5/4 as an isolated interval (which of course it is),<br/>but then I say that it cannot exist as anything but a signifier for 5/4 due<br/>to our ear&apos;s inability to hear such high ratios. Now, 81/64 is alot closer<br/>to 400c than is 5/4, and is of course a classic 3 (prime)limit ratio, so<br/>why is it we dont read 400c as 81/64? I guess this is proof of Pauls<br/>statements about odd limit being more important than prime limit when it<br/>comes to consonance. In fact we read 81/64 as 5/4 too. (81/64 is closer to<br/>9/7 than to 5/4. Can 81/64 be read as 9/7 under some circumstances?) So<br/>maybe its not about how high you can hear, but how close is the ratio<br/>you&apos;re trying to hear to a low (odd) limit ratio with its black hole<br/>attractor? The closer it is, and the lower the odd limit of the ratio it&apos;s<br/>near to, the harder it is to hear it &quot;as itself&quot; (81/64 may be closer to<br/>9/7 but 5/4&apos;s attractor is stronger?)</p><p>If we hear 400c played on a piano within the context of tonal music, we<br/>hear it as 5/4. But what is it we are hearing if we are played first 5/4,<br/>then 400c, as isolated intervals, and we experience them as distinct?</p><p>just wondering...</p><p>dante</p><p>ps- Paul also said:</p><p> (Once again, I<br/>&gt;apologize if I seem like I&apos;m being unnecessarily argumentative.

Or any<br/>&gt; other tuning system in use in Large groups!</p><p>   Well, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s as simplistic a matter as &quot;whether&quot; they work in<br/>a particular tuning, as much as how they affect each other.  It&apos;s had to deny<br/>that timbre affects the perception of tuning, but it rarely comes down to a<br/>pass or fail sort of effect.</p><p>   Here&apos;s an example effect:  If you wanted to demonstrate that a 400-cent M3<br/>doesn&apos;t sound as clean as a 5:4, would you use a clarinet or violin timbre?<br/>Answer:  Clarinet.  It will much raunchier on a clarinet than on a violin.</p><p>   Now as for how many timbres sound good on 12TET and several other equal<br/>temperaments.  I think that that&apos;s a meaningful point, but there&apos;s another<br/>partial explanation to consider too:  The spectrum of timbral possibilities<br/>sound good in realizing 5-limit harmony partly because those timbres were<br/>developed simultaneously with tunings designed around 5-limit harmonies.</p><p>   Anybody who listens to the demonstrations in Bill&apos;s book can hear that, as<br/>he put it, &quot;these are not subtle effects&quot;.  Now it&apos;s certainly true that the<br/>book deals, at first anyway, with extreme cases (like extremely widely<br/>stretched octaves for example) to illustrate the concepts more clearly.  But<br/>it&apos;s pretty obvious that the same processes that produce these extreme effects<br/>can produce significant effects under more subtle conditions.</p></div><h3><a id=1255 href="#1255">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
