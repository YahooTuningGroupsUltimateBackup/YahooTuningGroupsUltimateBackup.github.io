What would you rather I do?  Johnny</p><p>Hmm.  Maybe it doesn&apos;t give you a choice.  I am reminded of how technical of<br/>a thing this is and that in the &quot;real world&quot; many people are sending html<br/>email because they know of no other choice, and many/most email programs<br/>come with this option turnd on by default.  It is possible that AOL<br/>preferences give you a choice of whether to send email in html format, but I<br/>don&apos;t use AOL so I have no idea at the moment how to guide you to that<br/>choice.</p><p>In my email program (OutlookExpress) the preferences have a section called<br/>&quot;Compose&quot; and this includes an option which specifies Mail Format as either<br/>&quot;Plain Text&quot; or &quot;HTML&quot;.  There is also a separate option &quot;reply to messages<br/>in the format in which they are sent&quot; which overrides the first option when<br/>replying.</p><p>HTML is also sometimes called something else like &quot;formatted text&quot; in some<br/>email programs.  It has the advantage of allowing more flexible control over<br/>text.</p><p>Plain Text has other advantages, and all of them are probably related to the<br/>fact that it is a much simpler format, and also the original format for<br/>email, such that pretty much everyone in the world who has access to email<br/>will be able to read Plain Text messages, language problems aside.  HTML<br/>messages have been known to carry viruses (particularly to the Windows<br/>platform) in ways that Plain Text messages can not.  For this and other<br/>reasons many people try to block HTML email messages, so that they don&apos;t<br/>receive them.  Some systems give HTML messages a higher spam score,<br/>increasing probability of rejection.  Some people have the problem that a.m.<br/>and I apparently have with HTML messages causing crashes.  Many mailing<br/>lists either reject HTML messages automatically.  Others have etiquette<br/>policies that are biased against HTML.</p><p>More could be said, but that&apos;s probably enough for this &quot;off&quot; topic.</p><p>So, if you are willing to look into how to disable sending html email from<br/>AOL (if that is possible), from my standpoint that would be a good thing,<br/>but I am not into any kind of strict netiquette.  If you want help figuring<br/>out how to do it, I&apos;ll be glad to try to help you but this will not be so<br/>easy since I don&apos;t have AOL myself.  Making this change may have other<br/>advantages for you or others who you exchange email with, or you may end up<br/>not liking it.</p><p>Thanks for asking, and apologies for my indirectness in the first place.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2003 6:35:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45698">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45698</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Plain Text has other advantages, and all of them are probably<br/>related to the fact that it is a much simpler format,</p><p>***This is a little off-topic, but not entirely since this is an e-<br/>mail list.

was ~680 cents<br/>and would not sound like a &quot;perfect 5th&quot;, which Aristoxenus<br/>explicit states is the case.</p><p>2)<br/>October 2000 -- that perhaps Aristoxenus could have<br/>used arithmetically equal divisions of the 4/3 string-length<br/>as a handy means to visualize his concept that &quot;a 4th<br/>contains 2 + 1/2 tones&quot;.  the &quot;4th&quot; would thus be divided<br/>into 5 &quot;semitones&quot; by having the proportion 15:16:17:18:19:20.</p><p>this interpretation did in fact yield a final &quot;5th&quot; in<br/>the &quot;tuning by concords&quot; method which did approximate<br/>a 3/2 ratio ... but there are other &quot;4ths&quot; and &quot;5ths&quot;<br/>in the tuning procedure which are way off from Pythagorean.</p><p>but ignoring that ~680-cent &quot;5th&quot; has been bugging me<br/>ever since 1999, and so i finally have just decided on<br/>this conclusion:</p><p>3)<br/>that Aristoxenus at first tuned according to perfect<br/>4/3s and 3/2s in his &quot;tuning by concords&quot;, *then*<br/>tempered the resulting &quot;ditones&quot; (major-3rds) according<br/>to the geometrical division of the 4/3 into 5 equal<br/>&quot;semitones&quot;, or (4/3)^(x/5), *then* calculated two<br/>further 4/3s in opposite directions from those two<br/>&quot;ditones&quot;.</p><p>this yields a final &quot;5th&quot; is his &quot;tuning by concords&quot;<br/>method which is ~697.2629988 cents, which would sound<br/>close enough to a 3/2 to be able to serve as a<br/>consonant _diapente_ (perfect-5th).  in fact, it<br/>makes a pretty good meantone-like &quot;5th&quot;.</p><p>with this calculation, the &quot;tone&quot; = (4/3)^(2/5)<br/>= ~199.2179997 cents, and the &quot;semitone&quot; = (4/3)^(1/5)<br/>= ~99.60899983 cents.</p><p>this method of approximation may easily be extrapolated<br/>so that the 4/3 ratio is divided into 60 geometrically<br/>equal parts, (4/3)^(x/60), in order to calculate all<br/>the small divisions used by Aristoxenus.  in fact, this<br/>is the interpretation accepted by Boethius (c. 505 AD),<br/>which he probably adapted from Cleonides&apos;s summary of<br/>Aristoxenus (c. 100 AD).</p><p>taking note of the cents-values of the &quot;tone&quot; and<br/>&quot;semitone&quot; in the (4/3^(x/5) tempering, and seeing how<br/>closely they resemble 12edo, it is easy to see that<br/>(4/3)^(x/60) would be well approximated by 144edo.</p><p>... and that was exactly the statement which started me<br/>on this whole project back in 1999!</p><p>see the new final section (before the references) of<br/><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm</a></p><p>note that i cover the mathematics of this interpretation<br/>a few sections above the new one, in my &quot;Appendix 2&quot;,<br/>discussing Cleonides.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz@attglobal.net</h3><span>7/20/2003 7:42:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
