Hard to believe that g was his last good<br/>pitch to sing considering  i good down to Eb or d depending on time of day. But i am no expert on voice ranges of individuals.<br/>    It is interested how &quot;ritualized&quot; this g has become. I have no objection either. I have dug up my own symbolic meanings in it which might illustrate why different people  could want to tune to different pitches. 392 is a<br/>multiple of 49. the number of revolution in the I ching or &quot;madness according to some christian cabalist. La Monte also has a big thing for 49.<br/>    But less esoterically, since the tuning pitch has been rising and A is getting higher. Tuning to g is like saying &quot;wait a minute&quot; lets take a look back for a moment. This greek revivalist might be amused by such interpretation,<br/>as incorporeal as he would recognize it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Reference Pitches<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mark Gould&quot; &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Two things:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. Why did Partch choose G (392Hz)as his 1/1?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For as simple a reason as the following: G, in the bass clef, was the lowest tone that Partch could sing (intone) and still have full voice. It was his lowest &apos;good pitch&apos;, and worked well with his original stringed instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not very scientific, maybe, but that&apos;s where it came from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
