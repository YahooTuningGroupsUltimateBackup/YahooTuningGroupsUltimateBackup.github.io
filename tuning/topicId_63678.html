I know there&apos;s probably no real firm answers, but take Indian ragas, for example...why are they not using intervals up to, say, the 13 limit, instead of concentrating on 5 limit? If one is talking about low ratios, 13/8 is certainly lower than many of the 5ths based ratios one commonly finds, yet the 5ths based seem to be very common. And, another thought, between the fundamental and 32nd harmonic, there&apos;s a vast world of possible interval relationships, yet it seems like none of the maqam based musical cultures went there. Just lately, this fact has been dawning on me in a deep way...I&apos;ve been aware of it for years, but it&apos;s starting me to wonder about the choices people have made as to how they form and shape their musical expression.<br/>  Actually, by not exploring the overtone series in music, we (humans) have really limited ourselves for most of recorded history...and, I&apos;m sitting here wondering why, and I don&apos;t quite know. Unless, of course, the studies of numerology and number symbolism figure in somehow, which they most likely do. From my studies, I&apos;ve found these correspondences are very important to most cultures (except contemporary Europeans, for the most part). Where does music go from here? It would be interesting to see Indian maestros, for example, start composing ragas off the harmonics, and using those untapped upper ratios...and, they&apos;re not even that up, the 32nd harmonic is pretty low, in the sceme of things.<br/>  No biggie, just sort of thinking aloud...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 2:57:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Thinking about Indian and Arabic tunings (among others) lately<br/>has really<br/>&gt; got me to wondering about the way people around the world have<br/>tuned for<br/>&gt; thousands of years, and why.

Since Indian<br/>music doesn&apos;t make use of any chords, let along big multi-voice<br/>chords like this, it&apos;s not too surprising that ratios of 13 don&apos;t<br/>play a role there.</p><p>&gt; If one is talking<br/>&gt; about low ratios, 13/8 is certainly lower than many of the 5ths<br/>based ratios<br/>&gt; one commonly finds, yet the 5ths based seem to be very common.</p><p>If you can tune one fifth, you can tune a whole chain of them, and<br/>thus end up with some very complex 3-limit ratios. It&apos;s not that each<br/>of the notes so produces will be in a meaningful acoustical<br/>relationship with the fixed drone. But at least each of the fifths in<br/>the chain will be pure, and this seems to be important even in some<br/>of the Indian music I&apos;ve heard, where two soloists play a figure in<br/>parallel fifths or fourths. It&apos;s only when the music is a single<br/>melody against a single drone (at 1/1) that you can ignore the<br/>intervals between the pitch ratios and just look at the pitch ratios<br/>themselves.</p><p>&gt; And, another<br/>&gt; thought, between the fundamental and 32nd harmonic, there&apos;s a vast<br/>world of<br/>&gt; possible interval relationships, yet it seems like none of the<br/>maqam based<br/>&gt; musical cultures went there.</p><p>Really? We&apos;ve just seen all kinds of ratios of 11 and 13 posted in<br/>connection with Maqam music here!</p><p>&gt;    Actually, by not exploring the overtone series in music, we<br/>(humans) have<br/>&gt; really limited ourselves for most of recorded history...and, I&apos;m<br/>sitting<br/>&gt; here wondering why, and I don&apos;t quite know.</p><p>The overtone series is useful for just a few kinds of music -- none<br/>of which feature any harmonic movement -- including some that have<br/>used it for ages. For example, the Tuvan throat singers.</p><p>&gt; Unless, of course, the studies<br/>&gt; of numerology and number symbolism figure in somehow, which they<br/>most likely<br/>&gt; do.</p><p>It seems to me that the overtone series is often used as a *result*<br/>of numerology and number symbolism, so I don&apos;t quite know what you<br/>mean.</p><p>&gt; It would be interesting to see Indian maestros, for<br/>&gt; example, start composing ragas off the harmonics, and using those<br/>untapped<br/>&gt; upper ratios...and, they&apos;re not even that up, the 32nd harmonic is<br/>pretty<br/>&gt; low, in the sceme of things.</p><p>The way most sources give the Indian system, I can easily tune the<br/>whole thing by ear, by tuning each note to a single note I&apos;ve already<br/>tuned (and starting with a 1/1). S. Ramanathan describes this process<br/>in his 1973 article. But if you had a 31/16 in there, I&apos;d have no way<br/>of tuning it by ear, unless the whole tuning was a big harmonic<br/>series and I could play all the notes at once. A very different<br/>scenario.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2006 8:32:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; If one is talking about low ratios, 13/8 is certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; lower than many of the 5ths based ratios one commonly<br/>&gt; &gt; finds, yet the 5ths based seem to be very common.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you can tune one fifth, you can tune a whole chain<br/>&gt; of them, and thus end up with some very complex 3-limit<br/>&gt; ratios.
