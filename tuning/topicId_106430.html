You&apos;re correct that both x and y being<br/> even is an important special case. If x and y are both odd, you won&apos;t find solutions in this case,<br/> but it&apos;s not generally a problem; a counter example is 5*5 + 2*3 = 31, which describes the<br/> meantone diatonic scale as a subscale of either a 31-note meantone MOS, or 31-EDO.</p><p> The important thing is that d = gcd(x, y) divides N. So if d &gt; 1, the whole equation 5*x + 2*y = N<br/> can be divided by d, which leads to solutions for N/d-note tunings, which isn&apos;t desired,<br/> since we&apos;re interested in solutions for an N-note tuning. We can still &quot;fix&quot; this and get<br/> a usable solution by dividing x and y by d, and chaining the pattern d times together,<br/> meaning we get an MOS which has d periods per octave.</p><p> For example, the solution 5*4 + 2*6 = 32 can be viewed as 2*(5*2 + 2*3) = 32, which means the<br/> resulting pattern consists of two concatenated antidiatonic patterns: 2x sLsssLs = sLsssLssLsssLs,<br/> with s = 2 and L = 3.<br/> This is exactly my previous second example, here again the picture:<br/> <a href="http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png">http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png</a> <a href="http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png">http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png</a><br/> <a href="http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png">http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png</a><br/> <a href="http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha">http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha</a>... <a href="http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png">http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png</a></p><p> View on <a href="http://abload.de">abload.de</a> <a href="http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png">http://abload.de/img/terpstralayout-bamity1jeha.png</a><br/> Preview by Yahoo</p><p> It should be clearer if you imagine the numbers 0 to 15 were in the green block, and increase the numbers<br/> in the blue block by 16, <a href="http://s.th">s.th</a>. they range from 16 to 31, and both blocks together cover an octave.</p><p> &gt; The last one that works is 5*2 + 2*11, but this pattern is rather strange as consecutive tones are<br/> &gt; 3 pseudo-rows apart, and fingerings are inconvenient.<br/> Hm, seems I overlooked that one.

At the bottom there&apos;s 13/32, and at the top there&apos;s 15/32 (both green) - or,<br/> 13\32 and 15\32, if we write them as octave fractions. 13\32 corresponds to my first example, and generates<br/> a diatonic scale, while 15\32 corresponds to the third example which I overlooked, and generates an antidiatonic<br/> scale. If we slightly modify those generators, the 32-note scales won&apos;t be EDOs, but MOSes.</p><p> To find the MOSes with more than one period per octave, we also have to consider the divisors of 32 which are<br/> greater than 7, i.e. we have to look for nodes with a denominator of 16 or 8.<br/> The only one is 7\16, which generates an antidiatonic scale. But since we&apos;re interested in a 32-note MOS,<br/> we&apos;ll have to make that 7\32, and apply a period of 1\2 (= a half octave), which corresponds to my second example.</p><p> If you&apos;re looking for all possible layouts based on MOSes, you&apos;ll have to locate all ratios starting from the 1/3 node<br/> which have a denominator of 32, 16, 8 and 4, each of which will have an odd numerator. Then, each node on the<br/> path represents a smaller MOS, and therefore an own layout (yep, that&apos;s a lot).</p><p> Example:<br/> If we have a generator of ~13\32, the nodes on the path are 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 3/7, 5/12, 7/17, 9/22, and 11/27.<br/> The denominator tells us the number of notes the associated MOS has, and the predecessor&apos;s denominator<br/> tells us the number of either the large or small steps it has.<br/> E.g. the MOS associated with 5/12 has 12 notes. Since its predecessor 3/7 has a denominator of 7, the<br/> 12-note MOS is either a 7L5s or a 5L7s MOS (here, it&apos;s the latter).</p><p> Do you have specific criteria for what a good layout would be? For example, maybe the number of notes and the<br/> L/s ratio for the smaller MOS shouldn&apos;t be too small, or too large.<br/> Also, ideally the larger MOS would correspond to a scale that is a tempered version of the original tuning, meaning<br/> no interval size in the original tuning corresponds to different intervals in the MOS. If an MOS doesn&apos;t work,<br/> it&apos;s possible to use a MODMOS instead.</p><p> Best<br/> - Gedankenwelt</p></div><h3><a id=106436 href="#106436">ðŸ”—</a>baros_ilogic@...</h3><span>10/14/2014 4:11:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gedankenwelt,</p><p>I suspected that 5*4 + 2*6 = 32 which can be viewed as 2*(5*2 + 2*3) = 32 could be mapped as in your example of &quot;two concatenated antidiatonic patterns&quot;.

Is this done just like in your above example?</p><p> A way to look at this would be mohajira temperament, which has a neutral third generator that splits the fifth in two. If you stack 24 generators, you get two cycles of fifths which are a neutral third apart.</p><p> Another way would be godzilla temperament, which has a generator that splits the fourth in two &quot;semifourths&quot; of approximately 250 cents. Here again, stacking 24 generators gives two cycles of fifths (or fourths), this time a &quot;semifourth&quot; apart.</p><p> However, if two chromatic scales that are a quartertone interval apart are mapped to the terpstra keyboard via standard layout, the coordinate system isn&apos;t consistent, and moving in a specific axis direction can correspond to different step sizes. This isn&apos;t necessarily bad, but it&apos;s different from my examples, which are all based on a consistent coordinate system.</p><p> A third way to look at it may be catler temperament, but it&apos;s clearly based on 12-EDO, not on a chromatic scale generated by stacking fifths, so this may be a stretch.</p><p> &gt; What do you mean by &quot;interpreting the ratios as octave fractions&quot;; has this anything to do with &quot;interval of equivalence&quot;?</p><p> Yes. In the case of MOSes, there&apos;s always an interval of equivalence (IoE), and I assumed that it&apos;s the octave.<br/> (though it&apos;s no problem to use something else, like the tritave)<br/> Often, period and IoE are the same for an MOS. However, sometimes the period divides the IoE, in which case we&apos;d interpret the ratios as fractions of the period (which is a fraction of the IoE), instead.</p><p> &gt; Why the 1/3 node?<br/>&gt; And generally about MOSes: I never encountered any account of ratios from the 2/1 half. Why is just the 1/2 half of the Scale Tree used as ratio generators?</p><p> MOSes are strongly related to equal temperaments, and equal tempered intervals can be expressed as octave fractions, like 7\12 for the perfect fifth in 12-EDO.<br/> When applying a period (which we associate with 1/1), we can reduce the generators <a href="http://s.th">s.th</a>. they fall between 0/1 and 1/1. We can always take the smaller of the two generators, which falls between 0/1 and 1/2. This is the range that we get when we start at the 1/3 node.</p><p> Finding an intuitive layout for a subset of the harmonic series may be difficult, since it is kind of an opposite to MOSes: All steps are different in size, and they are sorted by size, instead of distributed evenly.<br/> Some good EDOs to start may be 46- or 87-EDO (good in 13-limit), 72-EDO (good in no-13s 19-limit), or 94-EDO (good as a 23-limit tuning), though that&apos;s still far from the 32-note 61-limit scale between the 32nd and 63rd harmonic, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for.</p><p> &gt; PS How did you generate that version of the Scale Tree?<br/> That&apos;s a scale tree implemented as a foldable &quot;mind map&quot;, that can be opened with FreeMind or similar programs, which offers a very useful search function. I generated it with a C++ program. I&apos;ll see that I upload it in the tuning-math file section, when I find the time.</p><p> Best<br/> - Gedankenwelt</p></div>
