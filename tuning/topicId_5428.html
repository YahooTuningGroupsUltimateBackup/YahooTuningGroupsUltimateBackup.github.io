With a zero fret, what would the solution to the problem of<br/>&gt;differing pitch bends for different string to fret distances be? Wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;we need to consider where a player plays on average and just tune the<br/>&gt;bridge appropriately?</p><p>Yes. One would not adjust the zero fret. The reason for adjusting the nut is<br/>that is usually quite a bit higher than the frets. The amount of extra<br/>pressure required to press a string down to the first fret is therefore<br/>considerable (try an F minor chord with heavy strings!), and even with<br/>appropriate bridge adjustment giving, say, a perfect octave at the 12th<br/>fret, notes on the first (and to some degree, second and third) fret will<br/>tend to be too sharp.</p><p>Although the correct adjustment to the fret placements will be some sort of<br/>complex mathematical function of the nut height, bridge height, and string<br/>tension/stiffness, adjusting the bridge _and_ nut positions, as well as the<br/>open string tuning, gives you three parameters (really, two &quot;interesting&quot;<br/>parameters; the open string tuning is like a constant term) with which to<br/>approximate that function, which is of course better than one parameter<br/>(bridge position only). According to Steve Vai, Buzz Feiten&apos;s system<br/>involves a separate nut, bridge, and tuning adjustment for each string.</p></div>
