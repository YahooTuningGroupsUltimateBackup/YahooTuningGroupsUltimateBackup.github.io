However, I&apos;m proud to say that we&apos;ve just<br/>wrapped up our first tuning list music collaboration via the mail.</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/Fusions.mp3">www.microtonal.org/mp3/Fusions.mp3</a></p><p>All collaborations, and once-removed ones like mail collaborations<br/>especially, require various degrees of giving one&apos;s self over to<br/>someone else--ostensibly someone you trust! Generally speaking, Jacky<br/>and I tend to work in different ways: you could say that I tend to opt<br/>for drastically changing parts and moods whereas Jacky tends to opt<br/>for the unity of a consistent thread that&apos;ll run through his pieces.</p><p>I think this collaboration is an example of two people coming from<br/>different places, conceptionally or aesthetically speaking that is,<br/>trying to work it out... though sometimes difficult, I think that&apos;s an<br/>exciting thing! I also think it speaks well for the spirit and<br/>potential of a community like ours as well--thanks Jacky.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
