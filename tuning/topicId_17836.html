You can use any tuning you want - scala<br/>files are fine.  You can also analyze sounds and use the harmonic<br/>spectrum obtained as a custom tuning.  I did that recently for the<br/>earth sounds broadcast by NASA.<br/><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast19jan_1.htm">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast19jan_1.htm</a></p><p>The downside is its only for Macs, and its idiosyncratic even for a<br/>Mac. Its one of the few pieces of software I&apos;ve actually read the<br/>manual - its that good and that difficult.   There is an informative<br/>piece in Electronic Musician this month by Len Sasso (anything Len<br/>Sasso writes is informative), and if you get the software I would<br/>order his Wizoo manual at the same time .  Doing so will save you a<br/>lot of trouble.  Also MetaSynth is only audio and basically produces<br/>sounds which can then be arranged in MetaTracks, or any other<br/>sequencing program.</p><p>Mary<br/><a href="http://www.elucida.com">http://www.elucida.com</a></p></div>
