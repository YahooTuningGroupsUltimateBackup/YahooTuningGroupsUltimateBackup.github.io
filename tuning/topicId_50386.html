Remember<br/>the Roman alphabet (also called the Latin alphabet). You&apos;re looking at<br/>it now. And so are speakers of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and<br/>30 or 40 other unrelated languages. And in the other half of the world<br/>Chinese characters were similarly successful in being used for<br/>multiple unrelated languages.</p><p>NOTE: UPPER CASE LETTERS DON&apos;T MEAN I&apos;M SHOUTING.</p><p>        I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW UNIVERSAL NOTATION CAN EXIST IF THE OCTAVE CAN<br/>      BE DIVIDED UP A INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS.

IF SOME FORM OF UNIVERSAL<br/>      NOTATION CAN&apos;T DEAL WITH IT THAT WOULD BE A DISSAPOINTMENT.</p><p>        AS FOR &apos;A CHARACTER SET THAT IS USED ACROSS MUTIPLE LANGUAGES&apos; ,<br/>      IT&apos;S TRUE THAT POLISH FOR INSTANCE HAS THE ENGLISH CHARATER SET, I<br/>      BELIEVE, YET SOUNDS EXIST IN POLISH WHICH DON&apos;T IN ENGLISH. THAT<br/>      RAVIOLI-LIKE POLISH FOOD NAMED PERIOGGIS (SPELLING?) AREN&apos;T PRONOUNCED<br/>      WITH A    &quot;PER&quot; SOUND AS THE FIRST SYLLABLE.  THE SOUND OF THE FIRST<br/>      SYLLABLE IS SOMETHING LIKE   &quot;PYHA&quot; . A SOUND THAT DOESN&apos;T EXIST IN<br/>      ENGLISH. I WISH I COULD TAKE THE ANALOGY FURTHER. MAYBE SOMEONE<br/>      ELSE COULD.</p><p>But I have used the term &quot;lingua franca&quot; myself in reference to the<br/>sagittal system, and so a better analogy here would be to English,<br/>which is (for better or worse) becoming many people&apos;s second language,<br/>in some cases purely for the purpose of communicating with others for<br/>whom English is a second language.</p><p>&gt;     My idea is to have software (any programmers out there) that<br/>&gt;   would take a 4 digit microprinted number next to a note. [look at<br/>&gt;   a new 20 dollar bill, go to the right of the lower left number&apos;20&apos;<br/>&gt;   to see &quot;The United States of America...&quot; to see how small and<br/>&gt;   unobtrusive microprinting can be.] The microprinting would be read<br/>&gt;   by the software and converted to the composers own format. The 4<br/>&gt;   digit number would be the number of cents up from the tonic that<br/>&gt;   the note in question is.</p><p>Such numbers would not have to be printed anywhere but simply stored<br/>invisibly by the program. You can already do this sort of thing with<br/>Finale and Sibelius. When you put a symbol on the staff, the index of<br/>the symbol in the symbol-table is what is actually stored. Then you<br/>can edit the symbol-table so that a different symbol appears at that<br/>numbered position and all occurrences in your score will automatically<br/>show the new symbol. But of course these programs aren&apos;t shareware.<br/>They do however have free downloadable demo versions that can&apos;t save<br/>or print.</p><p>        I STILL FEEL THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE MICROPRINTED. I HAVE SHEET MUSIC<br/>        FROM WHEN I WAS A TEENANGER IN THE 70&apos;S.  ARE THESE SOFTWARE<br/>        PROGRAMS REALLY GOING TO BE AROUND IN THE 20&apos;S AND 30&apos;S?  BESIDES THAT<br/>        IF SOMEONE HAS A SHEET OF PAPER SHEET MUSIC AND GOES TO SOMEONE ELSES<br/>        HOUSE, THAT MUSIC WITH THE MICROPRINTING COULD BE SCANNED INTO THEIR<br/>        COMPUTER WITH FINALE OR SIBELIUS OR WHATEVER AND THER&apos;YE OFF AND<br/>        RUNNING. OTHERWISE IT&apos;S USELESS.</p><p>            ABOUT ALL WE CAN AGREE ON HERE IS THE STANDARDS OF:</p><p>           1) WHERE EACH OCTAVE STARTS AND ENDS<br/>           2) THAT THERE ARE 1200 CENTS IN AN OCTAVE</p><p>           SINCE WE HAVE THESE AS THE ONLY STANDARDS (I ASSUME) I THINK WE<br/>           SHOULD USE THEM INSTEAD OF HAGGLING OVER NOTATION AND STAFF LINES.<br/>           IF SOME PEOPLE, EVEN 90% EVENTUALLY COME TO ACCEPT SOME FORM OF<br/>           UNIVERSAL NOTATION ,THE REMAINING PEOPLE COULD STILL, AT LEAST IN<br/>           THEORY HAVE SOME FORM OF FUTURE SOFTWARE CONVERT TO THEIR NOTATION,<br/>            OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND.<br/>                 I REALIZE THAT IF THIS SOFTWARE DOESN&apos;T CURRENTLY EXIST IT CAN&apos;T BE<br/>             USED.  YET CONSIDERING WHAT SOFTWARE IN ALL ITS FORMS TODAY CAN DO<br/>             I CAN&apos;T BELIEVE THAT READING &quot;2-0400&quot;, AND THE SOFTWARE SAYING TO ITSELF<br/>             THIS IS &quot;OCTAVE 2 NOTE E&quot; IS A HARD THING. WHAT WOULD BE HARD IS TO<br/>             CHANGE FORMATS. THAT IS, NOTATION THAT IN ONE PERSON&apos;S 15 EDO FORMAT<br/>             HAS NO EXTERNALS MARKS OF ANY SORT (uncertain of proper terminology) TO<br/>             SOME OTHER FORMAT.  ADOPTING  UNIVERSAL OCTAVE/NOTE [2-0400] MICRO-<br/>             PRINTING  COULD OR MIGHT PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR SUCH SOFTWARE TO BE<br/>             DEVELOPED OVER TIME.</p><p>&gt;     Over time (50 years?) I would think one or two standards for   15 EDO &gt;(and all other EDO&apos;s) would emerge on their own just   because some are &gt;logical and most aren&apos;t.</p><p>Two _have_ emerged. Chain-of-best-fifths with additional accidentals<br/>for one degree up or down, and notation relative to 12-ET with either<br/>cents or additional accidentals for fifth-tones and tenth-tones.</p><p>           I, DUE TO MY EXTREMELY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PREVIOUS<br/>       PARAGRAPH CAN&apos;T RESPOND TO ITS SPECIFICS. HOWEVER,  I THINK WHAT I<br/>       HAVE IN MIND CURRENTLY FOR A 15 EDO STAFF IS DIFFERENT.  REGARDLESS,<br/>       YOU&apos;RE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT SINCE 2 STANDARDS CURRENTLY<br/>       EXIST NO ONE COULD EVER COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAT<br/>       WOULD DISPLACE THEM BOTH.<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p><p>         Thanks for your input Dave     (Stephen Szpak)</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Worried about inbox overload?

If you say this works, that good enough<br/>    for  me.

Of course it&apos;s not universal. In fact it&apos;s bascially<br/>  like what Ivan Vyshnegradski did. The reason I didn&apos;t use his terminology of semisharp<br/>  and sesquisharp was it was too hard to say in my head over and over. Technically, with<br/>  the &quot;new&quot; notes boosted 60.88 cents and not 50.00 cents it would be invalid anyway.</p><p>      Since this is a 24 note scale I would suggest the standard staff.</p><p>   So you&apos;re saying that someone would know that:</p><p>          C-E-G-Ax</p><p>    ( in my terminology)</p><p>    would know in your terminology (I won&apos;t try to duplicate it here)</p><p>      that they should play a C major triad with a harmonic 7th?</p><p>         Stephen Szpak</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Take advantage of our limited-time introductory offer for dial-up Internet access. <a href="http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup">http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup</a></p></div>
