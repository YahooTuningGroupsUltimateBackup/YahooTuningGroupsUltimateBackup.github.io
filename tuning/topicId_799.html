Never read the liner notes.  I was aware that he felt Vienna to be<br/>his best.  I personally like Koln better.  I also have his Book of Ways,<br/>which is not good.  Most of his classical stuff is so-so, with the<br/>exception of the 24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovitch), which he nails.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/1999 10:58:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Keith&apos; Most of his classical stuff is so-so, with the<br/>&gt; exception of the 24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovitch), which he nails.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl</p><p>There are some recordings finally of Dimitri playing himself that has been out<br/>in russia for ever. Haven&apos;t picked it up yet. Still if you did an A/B test of<br/>the Roger Woodard recordings made on RCA in the Mid seventies I think you<br/>would be disappointed with Jarretts versions. The Roger Wooded version I enjoy<br/>so much I have taken a few steps to get it out again!

I<br/>also heard a tape of him improvising in Kirnberger II at a Japan concert.<br/>Though his improvisations are not really my cup of tea, it was clear that<br/>he was sensitive to the tuning.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
