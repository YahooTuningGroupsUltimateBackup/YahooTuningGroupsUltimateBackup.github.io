It is quite possible to reproduce these<br/>for yourself by using the template found in the Treasure Chest. In using the<br/>1-3-7-9-11-15 eikosany, i figured out quite a few different keyboard mappings<br/>before i ended up with the one i did. I will try to get up these examples in the<br/>mean time as a model for others to explore this scale or ones of their own.</p><p><a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>&gt;  Where can one find these?

Anyway, I think it telling<br/>&gt;  that Wilson settled on the middle one for Xenharmonikon. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; #<br/>&gt; These are the (unpublished) keyboard designs that Wilson sketched in the late<br/>&gt; eighties and early nineties while waiting for a generalized keyboard to<br/>&gt; emerge, long after the XH article. The mappings with Partch&apos;s scale are all<br/>&gt; to 41 tones, except for the 13-limit tuning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
