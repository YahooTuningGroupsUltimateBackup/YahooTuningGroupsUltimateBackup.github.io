Special keyboards can be expensive, if you<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t already noticed, so if you have one that will play many<br/>&gt; different tunings and octave divisions, then the market will be<br/>&gt; larger and the cost per unit will be less.

Having carefully read through most<br/>of the explanations, my general impression is that this is a very<br/>well-thought-out piece of hardware that deserves serious<br/>consideration by the dedicated microtonal keyboardist.  I wouldn&apos;t<br/>recommend buying it, however, unless I first tried it out, or got<br/>input from someone on this list who tried it (I seem to remember Carl<br/>Lumma saying that he did).  Haken cautions that it takes a lot of<br/>practice to master it (but so does a violin), but if it delivers<br/>what&apos;s promised, I&apos;d say it would be well worth the effort.  If I<br/>were 30 years younger and didn&apos;t already have a Scalatron, I&apos;d be on<br/>my way to Champaign, IL right now to try it.</p><p>&gt; * TONAL PLEXUS<br/>&gt;    <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28intro.html">http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28intro.html</a></p><p>The verdict on this one may depend on whether you think 205<br/>pitches/octave is overkill, but I think it has lots of<br/>possibilities.  (No point in my making any further comments, since<br/>you can contact Aaron Hunt directly.)  Again, if I were younger, I&apos;d<br/>be paying him a visit to try it out.</p><p>&gt; * Wilson Generalized Keyboards from Starr Labs<br/>&gt;    <a href="http://www.starrlabs.com/keyboards.php">http://www.starrlabs.com/keyboards.php</a> (below, not much details<br/>&gt; there anymore)</p><p>I haven&apos;t tried the Microzone keyboard, but I&apos;ve seen comments on<br/>this list that were critical of its very shallow key travel.  I<br/>recall that when I first visited this website a few years ago, I saw<br/>that the key distances (center-to-center) were slightly larger than<br/>on the Scalatron generalized keyboard, making the octave reach<br/>somewhat greater.  (Since the Scalatron octave distance is the same<br/>as C to B on a piano, a reach of a tenth is equivalent to one key<br/>less, which is very nice!)  Having used the Scalatron GK for many<br/>years, I came to the conclusion that it would be even better if the<br/>dimensions were a bit smaller; however, the physical size of the key<br/>switches would not have allowed it.  Monz would be able to give you<br/>more information, since he was in close contact with Harvey Starr<br/>during its development.</p><p>Graham mentioned the Ztar as a possibility:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_76152.html#76171">/tuning/topicId_76152.html#76171</a></p><p>&gt; * Thummmer<br/>&gt;    <a href="http://www.thummer.com/">http://www.thummer.com/</a></p><p>This one uses a concertina-type button arrangement that&apos;s great for<br/>diatonic music, particularly if you want sharps that differ in pitch<br/>from flats.  It appears that it&apos;s absolutely essential to have<br/>separate button-boards for the two hands, because otherwise the hands<br/>would tend to get in each other&apos;s way.</p><p>However, I really can&apos;t get excited about the button arrangement,<br/>because my experience with the conventional accordion left-hand<br/>button arrangement makes it immediately apparent to me that a<br/>chromatic scale on the thummer is going to require *a lot of<br/>practice* (and a panchromatic scale in 19-equal would be even<br/>worse).  Likewise, any tuning in which 81/80 doesn&apos;t vanish is going<br/>to be difficult with this button arrangement, because a major triad<br/>will require a considerable reach to get the 3rd of the chord: either<br/>C-D#-G (for 22) or C-Fb-G (for a schismatic temperament, assuming<br/>there&apos;s an Fb available).</p><p>&gt; * ??

I speak from experience,<br/>having successfully learned, in short order, two different<br/>transpositionally invariant layouts (the Scalatron GK, and the<br/>Moschino free bass system for the accordion left hand).  It&apos;s so much<br/>quicker when you don&apos;t have to practice every scale, chord, and<br/>arpeggio in every single key.</p><p>In fact, with the generalized keyboard, most of the 12-tone fingering<br/>patterns of the conventional keyboard *are preserved* in all of the<br/>natural keys (except F), and in all of the other keys (be it 19, 22,<br/>or 31 of them) they&apos;re the same as in the key of C.  And since I<br/>don&apos;t have to remember special fingering patterns for the keys of D#<br/>or Fb, e.g., I&apos;m way ahead of you, even before I&apos;ve begun.</p><p>&gt; I should imagine that this design can be used for<br/>&gt; any tet equal or below 24tet efficiently and inefficiently for<br/>&gt; anything higher than 24tet so long as the composer doesn&apos;t modulate<br/>&gt; all over the place.</p><p>Duplicate keys (which are an integral part of a generalized keyboard)<br/>will take care of extensive modulation.  31-equal on the Scalatron GK<br/>is really no more difficult than 22.  The fingering patterns for 29<br/>(also similar to 41 and 53) are a bit more challenging, but still<br/>manageable.  (The GK Scalatron that Paul Rapoport obtained for<br/>McMaster Univ. in Hamilton, Ontario has 41 and 53 capability.)  OTOH,<br/>17 and 19 are as easy as 12.</p><p>&gt; Concerning 53tet. This was the first microtonal<br/>&gt; system which I ever studied and its charm and elegance still<br/>&gt; impresses me after 20years. I for one would like to have a 53tet<br/>&gt; keyboard with all the latest bells and whistles.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s nice to dream about such things!</p><p>&gt; I have focussed on<br/>&gt; 22tet because it is not only beautiful but also in the realms of<br/>&gt; singability. I hope that this addresses your<br/>&gt;<br/>issues.<br/>&gt;        Robert.</p><p>One other thing.  You wrote:</p><p>&gt; The design I posted is the best fit solution for both 22 and<br/>&gt; 24tets.     Robert</p><p>I neglected to point out that this keyboard<br/><a href="/tuning/files/secor/GenKbd.jpg">/tuning/files/secor/GenKbd.jpg</a><br/>has both 22-equal *and 24-equal* on it (as permanently hard-wired<br/>tunings).  I didn&apos;t mention 24 before, because it&apos;s not strictly<br/>transpositionally invariant, but for this one I took a page from your<br/>book. ;-)  There are two sets of 12-ET a quartertone apart, one on<br/>the red, white, and black keys, and the other on the blue and green<br/>keys; each set of 12 is transpositionally invariant.  (This was done<br/>because I wanted 12-equal as one of the hard-wired tunings, and it<br/>would have been a waste to have so many keys with only 12 different<br/>pitches/octave.)  When reading music for 24-equal, I simply pretend<br/>that it&apos;s in 31-equal, and my fingers automatically go to the proper<br/>keys.  Now, how&apos;s that for convenience?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=76190 href="#76190">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2008 12:36:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; * Haken Continuum<br/>&gt; &gt;    <a href="http://www.hakenaudio.com/Continuum/">http://www.hakenaudio.com/Continuum/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I saw this a while back and was quite intrigued with the concept<br/>&gt; of a 3-parameter keyboard alternative.  Having carefully read<br/>&gt; through most of the explanations, my general impression is that<br/>&gt; this is a very well-thought-out piece of hardware that deserves<br/>&gt; serious consideration by the dedicated microtonal keyboardist.<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t recommend buying it, however, unless I first tried it<br/>&gt; out, or got input from someone on this list who tried it (I seem<br/>&gt; to remember Carl Lumma saying that he did).</p><p>dI had it in my office at Keyboard magazine for 2 months, along<br/>with Lippold&apos;s Kyma.  I subsequently published the first review<br/>of it anywhere, in that magazine.  You can read my review here:</p><p><a href="http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/haken-audio-continuum/Aug-04/1874">http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/haken-audio-continuum/Aug-04/1874</a></p><p>I don&apos;t recommend it for &apos;regular paradigmers&apos;, but it is a<br/>very well-engineered and well-made device that I&apos;m sure will<br/>be put to very good use in music.</p><p>&gt; &gt; * TONAL PLEXUS<br/>&gt; &gt;    <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28intro.html">http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28intro.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The verdict on this one may depend on whether you think 205<br/>&gt; pitches/octave is overkill, but I think it has lots of<br/>&gt; possibilities.  (No point in my making any further comments, since<br/>&gt; you can contact Aaron Hunt directly.)  Again, if I were younger, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; be paying him a visit to try it out.</p><p>The Tonal Plexus, on the other hand, is not incredibly well<br/>designed/built.  The key have very little travel and essentially<br/>function as click-switches.  They are very small, and have varying<br/>heights to (I believe) help the player distinguish them by feel.<br/>However the surface of the instrument is some sort flexible plastic<br/>sheet, and on the unit I played, some of the lower keys were so<br/>close to the surface of the instrument that they could drop<br/>*below* the surface when it flexes, making them unplayable.  We<br/>had to twist the instrument axially to flex the plastic surface<br/>keybed surface so that all the keys sat above it.  On the other<br/>hand, the Plexus the cheapest designed-to-be-microtonal extended<br/>keyboard today, and I&apos;d choose it over the Continuum as a<br/>regular paradigmer.</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t tried the Microzone keyboard, but I&apos;ve seen comments on<br/>&gt; this list that were critical of its very shallow key travel.</p><p>I may have made some of those.  However, I want to stress that<br/>I&apos;ve never played the Microzone.  More recently I&apos;ve come to<br/>suspect it might be pretty good.</p><p>&gt; &gt; * Thummmer<br/>&gt; &gt;    <a href="http://www.thummer.com/">http://www.thummer.com/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This one uses a concertina-type button arrangement that&apos;s great<br/>&gt; for diatonic music, particularly if you want sharps that differ<br/>&gt; in pitch from flats.  It appears that it&apos;s absolutely essential<br/>&gt; to have separate button-boards for the two hands, because<br/>&gt; otherwise the hands  would tend to get in each other&apos;s way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I really can&apos;t get excited about the button arrangement,<br/>&gt; because my experience with the conventional accordion left-hand<br/>&gt; button arrangement makes it immediately apparent to me that a<br/>&gt; chromatic scale on the thummer is going to require *a lot of<br/>&gt; practice* (and a panchromatic scale in 19-equal would be even<br/>&gt; worse).  Likewise, any tuning in which 81/80 doesn&apos;t vanish is going<br/>&gt; to be difficult with this button arrangement, because a major triad<br/>&gt; will require a considerable reach to get the 3rd of the chord:<br/>&gt; either C-D#-G (for 22) or C-Fb-G (for a schismatic temperament,<br/>&gt; assuming there&apos;s an Fb available).</p><p>The Thummer isn&apos;t available yet, and has no existing schedule<br/>for production.  I have played it (courtesy of Roger Linn).<br/>I&apos;m pretty sure its keys can be remapped however you like.<br/>It&apos;s a great little device and if it does see retail for under<br/>US$1000 I would definitely buy one.</p><p>&gt; &gt; * ?? TERPSTRA generalized MIDI keyboard -- only a prototype?<br/>&gt; &gt;    <a href="http://www.cortex-design.com/body-project-terpstra-1.htm">http://www.cortex-design.com/body-project-terpstra-1.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would prefer that Fb (key 12) and E (key 11) were aligned<br/>&gt; along the y-axis (as they are on the Scalatron GK), so as to<br/>&gt; make it a little easier to play C-E\-G (as C-Fb-G) in a<br/>&gt; schismatic tuning, which would require two fingers on C and G,<br/>&gt; with the thumb crossed under to play E\ .  Otherwise, it<br/>&gt; looks pretty good.</p><p>I hate to say that the only two of these keyboards I&apos;ve never<br/>played are my favorites, but in fact the Microzone and especially<br/>the Terpstra seem most likely to be what I really want.

I just looked at the Continuum website, and the<br/>answer is a resounding &quot;yes&quot;:</p><p>&lt;&lt; The Rounding Grid</p><p>Precisely correct pitches correspond to certain finger positions.<br/>These fixed positions form a grid; the grid may be spaced evenly (as<br/>in equal-tempered tuning) or unevenly (for example as used by Just<br/>Intonation tunings). Esoteric and downright bizarre tunings and grids<br/>can be user specified. The Round Rate mechanism also allows you to<br/>control the rate at which finger position correction drifts toward<br/>the rounding grid, anywhere from instantaneous to glacial.</p><p>Division of the Octave into &quot;N&quot; Parts Grid</p><p>In this alternate tuning there is an even relationship between<br/>location and pitch, and all rounding positions are equally spaced,<br/>reflecting the division of each octave into &quot;N&quot; equal parts.</p><p>The normal octave can be divided into anywhere from 1 to 50 equal<br/>parts. For instance quarter tone music would use a division of 24.</p><p>Custom Tuning Grids</p><p>The Continuum Fingerboard has 8 user-definable downloadable tuning<br/>grids. The grid points in a tuning are used for Round Initial<br/>Pitches, for Round Rate, and for nonuniform pitch-warping of the<br/>playing surface without any rounding. Each grid point is defined by<br/>two numbers: a position on the surface (specified by equal tempered<br/>note number with fractional value, shown in yellow), and the pitch<br/>for that position (specified by note number with fractional value,<br/>shown in blue). For most tunings, the pitch matches the position at<br/>each grid point; if not, the number of cents per inch will vary<br/>across the surface. These tuning grids can be created by sending NRPN<br/>values to the Continuum as described in the Configuration page, or by<br/>using on online Tuning Downloader web application. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Did you spend much time trying out microtonal grids?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=76194 href="#76194">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torstenanders@gmx.de&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2008 2:17:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Carl,</p><p>thanks for these valuable details.

Is<br/>&gt; there a setting to change the snap-to grid to something else, e.g.,<br/>&gt; 19-, 22-, 31-, or 34-ET, or a user-definable tuning (via .scl file)?</p><p>It had no such built in feature at the time I reviewed it.<br/>I did ask Lippold about snap-to-19, and he said it could be<br/>done quickly in Kyma.</p><p>&gt; (Or if not, did you happen to ask Mr. Haken if he considered adding<br/>&gt; such a feature?)  If so, I would think that this could be the<br/>&gt; ultimate polyphonic microtonal instrument.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it would be as great as you think.  Even playing<br/>polyphonically in 12-ET with the snap feature is pretty difficult.</p><p>One of the things I tried to get across in my review is that<br/>one has to press pretty hard to get the notes.

That isn&apos;t<br/>supported by many synths, but Lippold wrote stuff in<br/>Kyma to support it.  It also has MIDI out and I tested<br/>it as well with a Roland module.  At the time, Lippold<br/>was really pushing the better performance of 1394.  I<br/>don&apos;t know what he&apos;s up to now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t recommend it for &apos;regular paradigmers&apos;, but it is a<br/>&gt; &gt; very well-engineered and well-made device that I&apos;m sure will<br/>&gt; &gt; be put to very good use in music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, but what do you mean by &apos;regular paradigmers&apos; here?</p><p>People interested in creating polyphonic music in<br/>extended just intonation (or an approximation of it)<br/>based on the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; established<br/>here and on the tuning-math list.  That includes<br/>generalized diatonicity and a host of loosely related<br/>concepts in the spirit of common practice Western<br/>music.</p><p>&gt; I feel, for exploring chords or even chord progressions in tune is<br/>&gt; just more easy pushing multiple buttons.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; As George already asked<br/>&gt; before: have you tried any rounding mode beyond 12 ET? How<br/>&gt; easy is it to play chords that way?</p><p>x = performer&apos;s left-right<br/>y = performer&apos;s direction of sight<br/>z = down into the keyboard</p><p>Weell... it&apos;s fairly easy to play chords with the 12-ET snap<br/>enabled.  But it isn&apos;t easy to play them quickly.  And it<br/>would be harder with higher ETs because your x accuracy would<br/>have to be that much better.</p><p>There are generally two problems with the Continuum<br/>vs. a keyboard:</p><p>1. A generalized keyboard makes good use of the y axis to<br/>store extra notes.  I gather from the term &quot;tuning grid&quot;<br/>that Haken lets you do this too.  However, the Continuum<br/>isn&apos;t as deep as most generalized keyboards.  AND, as<br/>stated in my article, the Continuum is not truly y-polyphonic.<br/>It is the Gillette razor approach -- underneath the playing<br/>surface is a single row of metal rods parallel to y, each<br/>one mounted on springs at both ends.  The angle of a rod<br/>in the y-z plane is converted into y position on the surface.<br/>Therefore, one cannot play two tones on with the same y<br/>coordinates, as there is only one rod and it will again<br/>become parallel to the floor, and you get a single note of<br/>the x pitch corresponding to the rod with a greater z<br/>displacement (usually: louder).</p><p>2.  It is much easier to play quickly and control z forces<br/>than it is to control z displacement.  On a mechanical<br/>keyboard (piano especially), the player&apos;s finger need not<br/>be touching a key when it begins sounding, due to the<br/>momentum of the action.  The player imparts an initial<br/>velocity to the key by applying a precise amount of force<br/>very quickly, and then forgets about it.  But the Continuum<br/>does not measure z force.  It measures z displacement, and<br/>it measures it continuously.  Therefore one must hold his<br/>finger at a constant position (against the force of a spring)<br/>to maintain a static z value.  He must be able to precisely<br/>&apos;measure&apos; the depth of his finger into the playing surface<br/>to get a desired z value, and this is difficult because the<br/>spring can not be tight enough to produce big differences in<br/>force between subtlety different z depths.<br/>The Terpstra keyboard, on the other hand, is even better than<br/>a conventional MIDI keyboard because it does not measure<br/>the velocity at key bottom, but rather more like a piano<br/>measures the velocity *during* the keystroke.</p><p>Hopefully this makes some sense.</p><p>&gt; But, man, listening to the Continuum  demos just made me<br/>&gt; feel envy -- you can not do such detailed and expressive<br/>&gt; melodies with buttons...</p><p>No.  Then again, the Continuum is nothing new in this<br/>sense.  The guitar is both polyphonic and allows one to<br/>touch the notes.  Orchestral strings are less polyphonic<br/>but even more expressive than the Continuum.</p><p>That said, when you&apos;ve heard the masters swing a miniMoog<br/>&apos;round it is quite amazing.  Then again, the mini was<br/>also monophonic!!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=76205 href="#76205">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2008 8:28:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote...</p><p>&gt; The Tonal Plexus, on the other hand, is not incredibly well<br/>&gt; designed/built.

However the surface of the instrument is some sort<br/>&gt; flexible plastic sheet, and on the unit I played, some of the<br/>&gt; lower keys were so close to the surface of the instrument that<br/>&gt; they could drop *below* the surface when it flexes, making them<br/>&gt; unplayable.  We had to twist the instrument axially to flex the<br/>&gt; plastic keybed surface so that all the keys sat above it.
