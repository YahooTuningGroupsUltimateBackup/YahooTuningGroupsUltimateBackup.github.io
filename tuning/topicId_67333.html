This is from recent activity on the<br/>Csound list. Thorin Kerr did a brilliant piece, well worth hearing. Read<br/>below, my comments follow immediately, and the links are in the quoted<br/>section....</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>----------  Forwarded Message  ----------</p><p>Thanks for posting Thorin&apos;s work here Dave. I wasn&apos;t willing to sit through<br/>the long rendering time, but I was very curious about the work....</p><p>Just got through listening. It&apos;s a fantastic example of both getting the most<br/>out of Csound, and of tastefully imaginative and colorful algorithmic<br/>composition and &apos;orchestration&apos;. And, the use of just intonation is<br/>tremendously well done. In fact, I want to post a link on the tuning and<br/>MakeMicroMusic lists!</p><p>Bravo, Thorin!</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>On Tuesday 25 July 2006 10:04 am, Dave Seidel wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thorin is traveling right now, and intends to reply to his messages when<br/>&gt; he can.  In the meantime, here are links to rendered versions of &quot;Diving<br/>&gt; I&quot; that I made.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MP3 version: <a href="http://mysterybear.net/files/Diving_I.mp3">http://mysterybear.net/files/Diving_I.mp3</a><br/>&gt; OGG version: <a href="http://mysterybear.net/files/Diving_I.ogg">http://mysterybear.net/files/Diving_I.ogg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; CSD/WAV sources: <a href="http://mysterybear.net/files/Kerr-Diving_I.zip">http://mysterybear.net/files/Kerr-Diving_I.zip</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are some comments Thorin made about the piece in an email to me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I used python to generate almost the entire score. There is a little<br/>&gt; bit of hand editing here and there. I&apos;m still a bit green with<br/>&gt; programming. Very briefly: I use python to read Scala tuning scales<br/>&gt; (Did I mention it&apos;s largely Just Intonation?). Then there&apos;s lots of<br/>&gt; sequence permutations which index pitch scales, intervals and rhythmic<br/>&gt; cells. While working: I generate lots of score files, and use a master<br/>&gt; score with numerous #include statements. That&apos;s pretty much the entire<br/>&gt; composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There will (should) be more... it is &apos;part I&apos; after all. I usually use<br/>&gt; Csound in every piece I write, but this is really the first<br/>&gt; Csound-only one. I have to admit... it takes some persistence to iron<br/>&gt; out the wrinkles, but, once you have the tools, and a working method,<br/>&gt; it gets easier.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Dave</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p></div>
