Looks interesting,<br/>I may be able to drag myself down there.</p><p>Now, let&apos;s see what I have to say about the OT discussion.</p><p>Yes, Dancer in the Dark is a truly amazing film.  I know it&apos;s not to<br/>everybody&apos;s taste, but it&apos;s good to see it does have some supporters<br/>here.  Nobody I mentioned it to in RL had even heard of it.</p><p>Not costing or making much money would certainly count against it at<br/>the Oscars.  This is an industry award, so they have a vested interest<br/>in keeping the money flowing towards them.  It&apos;s also critical of the<br/>American criminal justice system, and could be interpreted (given the<br/>kind of shallow analysis I&apos;d expect of the Oscar judges) to be<br/>critical of the healthcare system.  I can understand them not<br/>appreciating such criticism from foreigners.  The best song is the<br/>obvious token award because it was sung and co-written by an<br/>established pop star.  Even given all that, they must have had hearts<br/>of stone to pass over her performance in the last (or was it next to<br/>last?) scene.  But there you go.</p><p>My other favourite films of the year (Chicken Run and In the Mood for<br/>Love, assuming Rosetta would have counted for last year) got no Oscar<br/>nominations at all.  I&apos;ll see Crouching Tiger when it opens in<br/>Clevedon in a couple of weeks.</p><p>As I&apos;m being self indulgent, I&apos;ll also point out that I managed to<br/>bring MOS scales into a discussion on rec.music.theory</p><p>Okay, back to work now.  And don&apos;t put two sheets into the machine,<br/>because you know what&apos;ll happen.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
