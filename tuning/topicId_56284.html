Mathieu&apos;s book _The Harmonic Experience_<br/>&gt;and tuning issues (in particular, 31 notes)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As a private student of Mathieu, he&apos;s personally gone over most of this<br/>&gt;book with me, and corrected many of my misunderstandings of it--so I<br/>&gt;think the below is a good (but very summary) representation of the<br/>&gt;author&apos;s intention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Mathieu&apos;s approach to harmony is fundamentally about coming to hear how<br/>&gt;12-tone equal-temperment can _represent_ 5 and/or 7-limit just<br/>&gt;intonation.  For example, if you play a C major triad, and then an E<br/>&gt;major triad, and then a C major triad, and then a Ab major triad, then<br/>&gt;the G# and the Ab are the same key on a 12-tet keyboard, but the G# is<br/>&gt;heard as representing 25/16 while the Ab is heard as representing 8/5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The real magic comes, though, when you play CMajor, EMajor, AbMajor,<br/>&gt;CMajor, because a big zap occurs when the same equal-tempered note<br/>&gt;changes from representing 25/16 G# to 8/5 Ab.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, from an hearing perspective, it&apos;s about hearing what<br/>&gt;just-intonation harmony is being represented in an equal-tempered<br/>&gt;harmonic progressions, and especially hearing how notes are modulating<br/>&gt;from representing one just-intonation note to another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The final element to the mix is symmetrical harmony, such as whole tone<br/>&gt;or symetrical diminished harmony, because this type of harmony<br/>&gt;_depends_ upon the equal-spacing of 12-tet to work.  So, for example,<br/>&gt;if you play the notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C-Bb-Ab-F#-E-D-E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D,<br/>&gt;somewhere in there, between Bb and F#, is distributed the sensation of<br/>&gt;modulating from 5-limit just harmony in C to symmetrical 12-tet, and<br/>&gt;then to 5-limit just harmony in D.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now, Mathieu outlines in the book the 31 just intervals which are<br/>&gt;easiest to represent in 12-tet.  For example, while the Great Deisis<br/>&gt;above is easy to play in 12-tet, it is almost impossible to create a<br/>&gt;pythagorean comma, because this would require modulating through 12<br/>&gt;keys fast enough that sense memory would remember the first key you<br/>&gt;played.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, although Mathieu is a fan of alternative tunings, was a student of<br/>&gt;Easley Blackwood, author of &quot;The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic<br/>&gt;Tunings&quot;, and can sing (and expects his students to be able to sing) 31<br/>&gt;just intervals, tuning-wise he is a big fan of 12-tet harmony with<br/>&gt;variable-pitch solo instruments that can hone in on the just-intoned<br/>&gt;intervals being represented, or ensembles such as Renaissance singers,<br/>&gt;who can adjust there harmony continously to be in just-intonation,<br/>&gt;without being limited to only being perfectly in tune in one key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I love this group!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Louis</p><p>&gt;Date: Sat, 21 Jun 2003 09:01:50 -0700<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;mathieu&apos;s book is great, and i just mentioned it in this thread, but<br/>&gt;&gt;he does a very poor job of discussing which commas are associated with<br/>&gt;&gt;which temperaments, and leaves you thinking ET and JI are the only<br/>&gt;&gt;worlds. meantone in fact has been more important in western music than<br/>&gt;&gt;either -- 81:80 vanishes in meantone, but other &quot;commas&quot; don&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;He&apos;s (for right or wrong) coming from the point of view that<br/>&gt;_perceptually_, the brain processes music as JI if it can find a<br/>&gt;tonality.  You reduce or eliminate the brain&apos;s ability to determine<br/>&gt;tonality by going symmetrical or pantonal.  ET is the optimal symmetric<br/>&gt;or pan-tonal scale par excellance, because it has maximum ambiguouty<br/>&gt;(sp?) between tonalities.  So, I understand him to be saying that the<br/>&gt;only two interesting tunings from the standpoint of the deep perceptual<br/>&gt;processes of the brain are JI and ET, though there are lots of possible<br/>&gt;choices in actual performance on the spectrum between these.  It&apos;s sort<br/>&gt;of like saying that the brain only processes three colors, red, blue,<br/>&gt;and green, although obviously the color pallete achievable from mixing<br/>&gt;these three is enourmous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;i&apos;m not sure how you would project both an &quot;unequivocal 25:16&quot; and an<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;unequivocally 2^(8/12) interval&quot; unless you are speaking literally of<br/>&gt;&gt;the exact tuning used in some sort of polymicrotonal composition. can<br/>&gt;&gt;you explain?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By unequivocal, I mean there only being one interpretation of the tone<br/>&gt;in the deep perceptual structures of the brain.  For example, if I play<br/>&gt;a C and an E on the piano, nice and slow, the brain thinks it&apos;s hearing<br/>&gt;a (slightly out of tune) 5:4 third.  On the other hand if I play a C<br/>&gt;major triad and then a G7 chord, and play a symmetrical diminished<br/>&gt;scale over that features a Ab/G#, the brain cannot resolve whether that<br/>&gt;note is the 16:15 of G or the 45:32 of D without context--is it the<br/>&gt;Phrygian of G or the Lydian of the secondary dominant of G? So that<br/>&gt;note does not have an unambigous JI interpretation.  And, if you play a<br/>&gt;whole-tone scale up and down repeatedly, after a while, it all melds<br/>&gt;together and you notice the equal spacing in the intervals--the brain<br/>&gt;is hearing the intervals as equally spaced, as opposed to JI harmonic<br/>&gt;relations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll next see Mathieu this Thursday, and I&apos;m sure he would appreciate<br/>&gt;questions and feedback.  All mistakes in my interpretation of his work<br/>&gt;are my own damn fault.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Louis</p><p>&gt;Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 11:01:56 +0100<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It occurs to me that maybe I&apos;m not doomed just because Mathieu thinks<br/>&gt;&gt; twelve notes of 5-limit 12-et define a lattice, because he also thinks<br/>&gt;&gt; 1 is a prime number. If I can correctly assume most musicians are not<br/>&gt;&gt; going to follow this usage simply because Mathieu says so, maybe there<br/>&gt;&gt; is hope for &quot;lattice&quot; also. I&apos;d be interested to learn what people<br/>&gt;&gt; here think a &quot;lattice&quot; ought to refer to, and whether twelve notes of<br/>&gt;&gt; 5-limit 12-et can be one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I can&apos;t find where Mathieu says either of these things.  Do you have<br/>&gt;references?  The only problem I can see with his use of &quot;lattice&quot; is<br/>&gt;that he confuses it with &quot;structure&quot;.  My reference being:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;We should here differentiate between the terms &grave;structure&apos; and<br/>&gt;&grave;lattice&apos; which are often used synonymously.  By &grave;structure&apos; we mean the<br/>&gt;actual pattern of the arrangement of atoms in space.  The term<br/>&gt;&apos;lattice&apos;, although loosely used to denote the atoms in a crystal,<br/>&gt;should be reserved to describe the network of points which show the<br/>&gt;simple translation vectors on which a structure is based.&quot;<br/>&gt;          H.M.Rosenberg, &quot;The Solid State&quot;,<br/>&gt;             Oxford University Press, 3rd Edition 1988, p.2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Translate that into musical terms, and cut him some slack for using<br/>&gt;&quot;lattice&quot; as a synonym for &quot;structure&quot;, and I can&apos;t find any problems<br/>&gt;with Mathieu&apos;s usage.  I can&apos;t find where he calls ET a lattice, but I<br/>&gt;wouldn&apos;t disagree with that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Page 27 of Harmonic Experience clearly implies that 1 is *not* a prime<br/>&gt;number.  Page 164 explicitly states that a lattice should strictly be<br/>&gt;infinite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 Graham</p><p>&gt;Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 19:03:23 -0000<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I can&apos;t find where Mathieu says either of these things.  Do you have<br/>&gt;&gt; references?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;On pp 64-65 we find  &quot;A *prime number* is a positive whole number that<br/>&gt;has factors only of itself and one. There is an infinite array of<br/>&gt;prime numbers, but only the first few (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) have obvious<br/>&gt;musical significance.&quot; This definition is clear, explicit, and wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Later on he discusses music in the prime limits, which includes the<br/>&gt;1-limit, where you bang away at a unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Page 27 of Harmonic Experience clearly implies that 1 is *not* a prime<br/>&gt;&gt; number.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Page 27 says five is the next prime after three, and two the prime<br/>&gt;before it. It does not say one is not a prime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Page 164 explicitly states that a lattice should strictly be<br/>&gt;&gt; infinite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Chapter 10 is called &quot;The Five-Limit Lattice of Twelve Notes&quot;; this is<br/>&gt;also the chapter that misdefines prime numbers. On page 65 he says<br/>&gt;&quot;Later we extend the lattice outward in both dimensions, but so far we<br/>&gt;have confined our field to a specific field of twelve notes. Hence a<br/>&gt;&apos;five-limit lattice of notes&apos;&quot;. People who think vague, murky<br/>&gt;defintions are good and precise ones bad might want to ponder the<br/>&gt;implications. What is a &quot;field&quot; of notes? Is the specific &quot;field&quot; in<br/>&gt;question something like a Fokker block (the Ellis duodene seems to fit<br/>&gt;the discussion pretty well, and Ellis is someone he is quite familiar<br/>&gt;with) or are we assuming temperament, so the lattice is rolled up into<br/>&gt;a torus (donut?)  We can&apos;t really know unless he tells us.</p><p>And what&apos;s this....

One of the things I<br/>&gt; admire most about the CPS scales is how good they are<br/>&gt; for &quot;reprogramming&quot; your emotional expectations of musical content.</p><p>I think of it as a broadening of experience, not a denial of the<br/>original/older meanings but rather a broadening of the context within which<br/>older meanings can be embedded.  We broaden our experience, increase our<br/>capacities for sustaining/integrating cognitive disonance, become stronger<br/>in a sense, more able to find resolution for more difficult (complex) kinds<br/>of demands/tensions.</p><p>&gt; An argument I had with Alauddin was about microtonality<br/>&gt; being &quot;number-crunching&quot;, and &quot;weird for weird&apos;s sake&quot;.  I argued<br/>&gt; that it was as good a means as any for arriving at a language that<br/>&gt; was articulate for the user.  He agreed.</p><p>I&apos;m just thinking in terms of what has happened so far with technology,<br/>trying to learn from the experience of that.  Technology is not something<br/>that has ever created decentralized culture.  It so far always requires an<br/>elite.  So you can&apos;t deny that that exists, but it exists as a subculture,<br/>necessarily a subculture so far because it depends for its survival on the<br/>marketability of the results of specialization, i.e. the tech elite depends<br/>on the consumer and the continued ability to engage the consumer.</p><p>In a way the same thing is true for music, that a the moment it looks like<br/>musicians represent a subculture, a kind of elite.  But is that the<br/>necessary state of things or is it a reflection of the tendency towards<br/>specialization which is so prevelent now?  I think it is not an inherent<br/>limitation, just something that has happenned.  On the other hand,<br/>superimposing a technological elitism on top of the current musical elitism<br/>would is not something that I would wish for.  This may to some degree<br/>happen, but it is not the vision I want to foster.</p><p>The unfolding of my own microtonal experience has so far depended a lot on<br/>technological resources.  I could conceive of how that would not have to<br/>have been the case, yet I wonder what limitations there would have been on<br/>the scope of what I could learn without the availability of &quot;technology&quot; to<br/>expand/facilitate my available experiences.  The science/technology of the<br/>past is something I could have learned enough from to know how to &quot;do the<br/>math&quot; of microtonality, and based on that I could have tuned real<br/>instruments, with some limitations.</p><p>So I think of myself as a member of a kind of transitional/provisional<br/>elite.  Yet because of my own life experiences with my own elitism, I do not<br/>seek to deepen it, and rather I seek ways to create more relationship.  So I<br/>believe it is important for us as the transitional technology-bound elite o<br/>be looking for how we can clarify our own experiences with less reference to<br/>anything technological, because it will be more important and more<br/>sustainable, or more important *because* it is more sustainable.  How can it<br/>be passed on and to whom?  What do I already experience that doesn&apos;t depend<br/>on &quot;technology&quot;.  (This is of course very related to concerns about notation<br/>which are being discussed a lot lately, yet is a little broader in scope.)</p><p>I&apos;m wanting to use the word technology fairly loosely, and perhaps its too<br/>vague, yet I want to refer to anything that requires experience that is not<br/>likely to become innate in the absense of skills more specialized than what<br/>a &quot;typical&quot; musician is likely to be interested in getting involved in.  Yet<br/>harmonic chanting, also coming up in this thread, is the proof of something<br/>containing what might otherwise be &quot;technological&quot; information that is<br/>actually innate.  And then utonality (for example) is already a step removed<br/>from that, a separate &quot;leap&quot;.  And indeed things that do make their way into<br/>musical culture that depend on a series of conceptual leaps.  Really the<br/>course of this can not be predicted, and maybe the truth of it is that we<br/>transitional elite are not so much givine direction to what is to come as<br/>much as being simply a lucky few who get a sneak preview as to some of the<br/>possibilities.  The &quot;real stuff&quot; will have to constantly redevelop from the<br/>ground up, to become part of a broader culture.</p><p>To the degree and for the time that the culture as a whole goes more and<br/>more in a technological direction, then certain things will tend to unfold<br/>that I may not consider &quot;sustainable&quot;.  Yet I have no clue what is really<br/>going to happen.  Nonetheless I don&apos;t think we are in a good balance and I<br/>am interested in looking in other directions that seem simpler.  Some of<br/>this is purely practical and comes from an interest in being able to engage<br/>ordinary musicians who play particular &quot;real&quot; (physical) instruments that I<br/>am interested in.  It is a simple desire for relationship and a sense of<br/>reward in sharing, for discovering ways to convey experiences beyond the<br/>confines of my own specialized background and habits of thought.  I&apos;m just<br/>utimately more interested in that than I am in technological developments<br/>and the &quot;micraculous&quot; (never mind potentially disastrous) things that such<br/>will make possible.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=56354 href="#56354">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2004 12:25:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/1/04 8:05 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:ekin@lumma.org">ekin@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; And his emphasis on singability I thought was sound, even though he<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; did rule out 11-limit intervals (boooo!...  :-).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, boo.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; However, if you mean ruling out the singability of 11-limit intervals,<br/>&gt;&gt; that may be merely practical.  ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; On the other hand I&apos;m terribly interested in the possibility of 11- and<br/>&gt;&gt; 13-limit intervals becoming somehow singable, without pitch tracks a la<br/>&gt;&gt; Twining, or absurd levels of training that would not represent a<br/>&gt;&gt; culturallysustainable approach to music.

Can anyone<br/>&gt; get beyond 20?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and it can be done clearly, especially by using the &quot;Kargiraa&quot;<br/>&gt; technique of harmonic/throat singing where the harmonics are coming<br/>&gt; off of a much lower fundamental pitch.</p><p>Right, I had discounted that when doing my little test.  For some reason I<br/>was thinking the result would be the same, but apparently the ability to<br/>keep a sharp resonance is better an octave lower.</p><p>&gt; I (and others) have been able to sing above harmonic 20 using regular<br/>&gt; harmonic overtone singing techniques, but I agree that it often<br/>&gt; starts to sound weak and smeary - only on rare days does it clarify.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, I love using 11 and 13 while doing harmonic overtone melodies.</p><p>Me too.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=56398 href="#56398">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2004 11:06:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/3/04 12:51 AM, Pete McRae &lt;<a href="mailto:ambassadorbob@yahoo.com">ambassadorbob@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kurt Bigler &lt;<a href="mailto:kkb@breathsense.com">kkb@breathsense.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yea, I just tend to think 2 people isn&apos;t enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t swear that I actually have the skills, yet, but I&apos;d sure like to try<br/>&gt; out for the choir, if it could happen!    :-)    (seriously!)</p><p>Well Carl and I are in Berkeley, so let us know if you are in the area.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
