Also, it was not long<br/>after Mahler&apos;s death that Moellendorf, Busoni, Haba, etc., were<br/>interested in blatantly microtonal tunings.)</p><p>Thanks !!</p><p>------<br/>[*] Except for his songs with piano accompaniment, most of<br/>which were eventually arranged for (or perhaps even originally<br/>conceived with) orchestral accompaniment instead of piano,<br/>or incorporated into, or made the basis of, later orchestral<br/>works.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

It is at once<br/>one possible culmination of the Viennese tonal tradition and informed by a<br/>polyphonic sensibility that is more Bach than Bruckner. Likewise in his<br/>tuning practice: while the functional language can be parsed classically<br/>(i.e. meantone), the chords themselves often suggest richer harmonic<br/>resources (extended just), the melodic lines frequently demand an<br/>over-expressive exaggerated intonation (i.e. pythagorean leading tones),<br/>while the polyphonic overlay calls for the closure found in a temperament.</p><p>The task for the performer is to find an intonation that services all of<br/>these impulses equally well. While I find (and have written about it here<br/>before) it to be important that the most significant works in the<br/>Austrian/German tradition of the late nineteenth century are for<br/>instrumental ensembles without an intonationally-constraining keyboard<br/>instrument, I&apos;m afraid that the globally-active intonation will inevitably<br/>be 12tet, but very likely a 12tet that is improved upon locally by the best<br/>performers. (The Vienna Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony seem to be<br/>able to do this on automatic pilot, while Solti was and Boulez is able to<br/>drawn this out of even mediocre ensembles.)</p><p>It is precisely in this kind of repertoire that I hear as interesting for<br/>adaptive tuning. Earlier repertoire with continuo sounds to me too closely<br/>bound to either meantone or proto-equal tunings, but the absence of<br/>continuo, the slow advent of ET, and the continuously expanding harmonic<br/>language make the long transition of music over the course of the 19th<br/>century to be one with considerably more intonational conplexity  than is<br/>generally recognized.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt am Main</p></div><h3><a id=8278 href="#8278">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2000 6:51:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Daniel Wolf, TD 517.3]<br/>&gt; Mahler&apos;s music does indeed live through its contradictions.</p><p>A thousand Amens to that!</p><p>&gt; It is precisely in this kind of repertoire [&apos;works in<br/>&gt; the Austrian/German tradition of the late nineteenth<br/>&gt; century ... for instrumental ensembles without an<br/>&gt; intonationally-constraining keyboard instrument&apos;] that<br/>&gt; I hear as interesting for adaptive tuning.
