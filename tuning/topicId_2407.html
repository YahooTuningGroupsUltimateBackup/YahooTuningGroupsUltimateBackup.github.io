No retune motion would be required, as the intervals c-e and<br/>e-g# are already purely tuned in 1/4-comma meantone. However, if you wish to get back to C major be<br/>reinterpreting B# as C, you are assuming a closed circle of 12 fifths and you run into the same problem as<br/>above.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, are we starting to make sense to each other?</p><p>&gt;Yes, I think so.  By the way, do you have a web site?  Please forgive<br/>&gt;me if I&apos;ve missed a posting where you have referenced it.</p><p>The closest thing there is to a website for me right now is <a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/Erlich.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/Erlich.html</a>.<br/>I&apos;m still waiting for John Starrett to add some more links to my ideas to this page. Nothing on adaptive JI,<br/>though the idea of adaptive JI could prove very important to me in my proposed 22-tone 7-limit system. The<br/>mistuning of the 7:5 by 17 cents in 22-tET is bad enough to warrant very serious investigation into adaptive<br/>retuning. Also, as a guitarist I often adjust intervals towards JI by bending one or more notes; typically this<br/>represents a form of adaptive JI with the constraint that notes can only be bent upwards, not downwards.</p><p>-Paul E.</p></div>
