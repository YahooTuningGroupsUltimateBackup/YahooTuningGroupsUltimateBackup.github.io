But the webpage<br/>&gt;touches on the idea that there may not exist a single optimal tuning for a<br/>&gt;piece.</p><p>Mark, I get the sense you haven&apos;t been following too closely the discussion<br/>on adaptive tuning (including adaptively tuned Bach and Mozart) with John<br/>deLaubenfels, but I encourage you to go through the archives and see what<br/>you can get out of those discussions. The point is, there are ways to keep<br/>all the harmonies in JI, avoid key drift, and _still_ greatly reduce the<br/>maximum &quot;shift&quot; required of any pitch from one bar to the next.  A full<br/>comma shift, which you recommend in this webpage, is often disturbing to<br/>some ears, particularly if it occurs in the melody line -- it disturbs the<br/>flow of the music too much (although your particular examples have other<br/>interruptions to that flow, typically that won&apos;t be the case).</p><p>A simple example of adaptive JI is Vicentino&apos;s second tuning of 1555. Here<br/>we have not one but _two_ chains of 1/4-comma tempered fifths, one tuned 1/4<br/>comma higher than the other. (You may enjoy using NNN for this tuning). The<br/>rule is: in a passage of music using triadic harmony, the root always comes<br/>from the lower chain, the fifth comes from the upper chain, if there is a<br/>major third it comes from the lower chain, and if there is a minor third it<br/>comes from the upper chain. In this way all triads will come out just. Also,<br/>any music written in the framework of meantone temperament (your examples<br/>certainly qualify) will not require any melodic shifts larger than<br/>1/4-comma. I suggest you add Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI scheme to your list of<br/>alternatives for the musical examples you quote.</p><p>Since 1/4-comma is smaller than the just noticeable difference for _melodic<br/>shifts_, while a full comma shift can be quite disturbing, I&apos;d have to judge<br/>your strict-JI approach, with their full comma shifts, as less than optimal<br/>in many situations. Meanwhile, meantone is less than optimal because the<br/>total lack of melodic shifts forces all fifths and minor thirds to be<br/>out-of-tune by 1/4-comma, which is quite a bit _larger_ than the just<br/>noticeable difference for _harmonic intervals_.</p><p>So, in general, for pieces compatible with meantone tuning and using 5-limit<br/>triads as the consonant harmonies, Vicentino&apos;s second tuning of 1555 is a<br/>much better candidate for &quot;the optimal tuning&quot; than any of the alternatives<br/>you suggest, and, under a minimax melodic error criterion, with no tolerance<br/>for harmonic error, will often be _the_ optimal tuning.</p><p>-Paul</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
