That&apos;s what I was trying to say!</p><p>I do agree. The point is ready for the shelf. What is more important is<br/>that...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I agree<br/>&gt;&gt;with you that the chord Joe &quot;arrived at&quot; in both contexts is not<br/>&gt;&gt;particularly agreeable.</p><p>Paul clarifies:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [For those playing along, that was a reference to the last chord in the MIDI<br/>&gt; file Joe previously uploaded and a new version he sent us privately, in<br/>&gt; which a sus chord resolves to a 14:18:21 at the end].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, does that chord sound the same to you as the one Christopher Chapman<br/>&gt; posted? It should if it&apos;s a 14:18:21.</p><p>It does indeed, particularly the one with the more prominent partials. It is<br/>clear to me now that this tuning does _not_ contain the &quot;preferred high<br/>third.&quot; When I sang the &quot;high third&quot; into this item, it fought with the 7:9<br/>third, which is clearly too high. (Sorry to be so slow, folks, but I really<br/>had to hear it for myself. Thanks for your patience.)</p><p>However, when 14:18:21 is sounded with sine tones, it does initially appear<br/>to be a well-tuned high third. Apparently this &quot;softer/gentler&quot; experience<br/>is more easily &quot;morphed&quot; to fit a common concept--in this case, my concept<br/>of a &quot;high third major triad.&quot; Paul, you are absolutely correct that<br/>loudness and timbre affects such a perception. You also knew that it was the<br/>reason I accepted John Link&apos;s guitar chord as the &quot;real thing.&quot; (Thanks<br/>again to John for contributing that &quot;link&quot; ;-) to the answer.</p><p>But here is the interesting part. When I listen to the 4:5:6 examples--both<br/>sine and &quot;partialed&quot;--the third sounds too low to me. I want to raise it.<br/>(Call it &quot;cultural conditioning&quot; if you want to, but it certainly is not<br/>conditioning for the novice singers in my college choir who have heard<br/>tempered thirds all their lives.)</p><p>Now here is the _really_ interesting part. When I sang the &quot;high third&quot; into<br/>these items, it did not seem to fight with the sounding 4:5 third. If my<br/>vocal pitch was different to the extent I believe it was, it should have<br/>created a small tornado. It didn&apos;t.</p><p>My first thought was that perhaps I was not actually singing a different<br/>pitch and that the &quot;illusion&quot; theory is correct. So I sang in tune with the<br/>&quot;low&quot; third and when the chord stopped sounding I could hear that my voice<br/>had matched it. Then I sang the high third with the chord, and when<br/>the chord stopped sounding I could clearly hear that the &quot;high third&quot; is not<br/>the 4:5 third.</p><p>This really didn&apos;t surprise me, however, since I had noted that when I do<br/>the &quot;demo&quot; (soon to be posted) with a large group of singer, there is a<br/>&quot;period of adjustment&quot; just after the fifth is introduced in which some of<br/>the singers are slower than others to give up the 4:5 third. During this<br/>period, one can hear a bit of conflict as one third is replaced by the<br/>other. When all voices arrive, peace prevails again.</p><p>That is why I was rather surprised that my voice singing the &quot;high third&quot;<br/>did not seem to disturb the chord containing the 4:5 third. I&apos;ll play with<br/>this a bit more and post any new impressions.</p><p>The bottom line, then, is that the 7:9 third is _not_ the &quot;high third.&quot;<br/>(Some of you &quot;knew&quot; that already. I&apos;ll bet you are smiling your cute little<br/>faces off, aren&apos;t you.)</p><p>Thanks to all of you who were kind and patient enough to contribute<br/>information and experimentation to bring us (me and anyone else who wanted<br/>to be sure) to this important plateau.</p><p>Coming next week: sound examples of the &quot;high third.&quot; I promise.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8330 href="#8330">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
