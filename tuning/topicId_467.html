He may be reached at<br/><a href="mailto:interval@ixpres.com">interval@ixpres.com</a>.  I believe there are other programs available from the<br/>allegedly defunct mills college ftp site.  Two programs come to mind:<br/>&quot;Scala&quot; and &quot;Fasttrac&quot;.  I have Fasttrac if you want it.</p><p>I have used the pitch bend control in Cakewalk to generate just intervals,<br/>although process is slow.  If you are interested exploring scales in a<br/>simple way (ie not in the context of music) then a small program called<br/>&quot;Chime&quot; may suit your needs.  It allows you to create your own scales based<br/>on just ratios or 12TET cents in a text editor.  It comes with a great<br/>variety of theoretical, historical, and observed scale tunings from<br/>throughout the world.  I will upload the program to you if you like.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m interested in using a MIDI system (XG or GS) to explore alternate<br/>&gt;tunings in a more elegant way. Are there any sequencers for this?<br/>&gt;Does MIDI support different tunings?</p><p>&gt;Calin</p><p>While I&apos;m at it here&apos;s an update on the Carillon restoration and retuning<br/>that I have undertaken.  As a reminder, this carillon is a 1961 5 octave<br/>Schulmerich bell instrument that uses tuned steel bars, solenoid strikers<br/>and magnetic pickups to attempt to reproduce the sound of cast bell<br/>carillons through large PA speakers.  It includes a keyboard controller,<br/>mechanical roll player with timers and paper rolls.</p><p>Various members of this list have been very helpful in leading me down the<br/>proper path to creating what will perhaps be the only &quot;carillon&quot; tuned in<br/>JI.  Thanks to those of you who have helped.</p><p>Attempts to retune the original bars have proved entirely futile, as<br/>retuning significantly alters the pleasant timbre of the original bars.  I<br/>have finally acquired one of the patents for this instrument, and this<br/>document has proved invaluable in shedding light on its design.  The bars<br/>are engineered in such a way that the inharmonic partials are tuned so that<br/>the first 3 or 4 are in octave relationship.  This is accomplished by<br/>cutting grooves from each end at distance between .195 and .205 the total<br/>length of the bar, essentially making the bar thinner at these points.<br/>  This process gets the partials nearly in tune and fine<br/>tuning is accomplished by fixing 3 brass collars on each bar.  Each bar is<br/>equiped with two strikers, one that emphasizes the 1st and 2nd partials,<br/>and one that emphasizes the 3rd and 4th partials.</p><p>The patent also comes with a graph that plots the how grooving the bars<br/>through a range changes the interval relationships between the partials.<br/>The grooving range is from 0 to .500 of the total length, curve that each<br/>partial takes over the range resembles of rough sign wave.<br/>Based on this graph it seems that it would be possible to fine tune bars to<br/>a variety of different timbres that would achieve consonance.  If any one<br/>is interested I will upload this graph to a website.</p><p>Since retuning of the orignal bars is probably not possible, I am<br/>endeavoring to manufacture new bars, most probably of aluminum.</p><p>The tuning for the instrument will be a matrix of harmonics and<br/>subharmonics.  The keyboard is being replaced with a matrix keyboard midi<br/>controller and the roll player will be replaced with any simple sequencing<br/>program.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/>Gainesville, FL</p><p>PS: I have just received my copy of the tuning list CD.
