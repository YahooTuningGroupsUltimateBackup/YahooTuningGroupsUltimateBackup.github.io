I feel sorry that virtually no one in your family finds enjoyment in classical music. Ditto jazz.</p><p>2. Anecdotal data from a small family mean, pretty much, nothing</p><p>3. I make and play music with at least 100 musicians weekly. Virtually all of them are involved in classical music. Even the jazz musicians I work with have an appreciation for classical.

No.</p><p>*****</p><p>It does piss me off that I spent a fair amount of time, presenting some of the very people who might be conduits for what you are thinking about, and if nothing else would open your eyes a bit to the fact that music isn&apos;t *nearly* as segmented as you think.</p><p>But you&apos;ve completely glossed over any of this, with no acknowledgment. Maybe it is just late, but I don&apos;t feel any need to jump through hoops to assist someone who isn&apos;t the least bit interested.</p><p>I hope I&apos;m wrong, and that you&apos;ll check out some of those musicians, their work, and their friends and writings.</p></div><h3><a id=88839 href="#88839">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 11:19:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon S&gt;&quot;It does piss me off that I spent a fair amount of time, presenting some<br/>of the very people who might be conduits for what you are thinking<br/>about, and if nothing else would open your eyes a bit to the fact that<br/>music isn&apos;t *nearly* as segmented as you think.&quot;<br/>   Could be.
