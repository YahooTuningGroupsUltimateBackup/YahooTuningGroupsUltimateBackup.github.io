It is, as you very accurately and relevantly<br/>quote my earlier post, Joel, &quot;nuancing&quot; along a continuum with many<br/>shadings of concord and discord, and often in timbres where almost any<br/>interval can sound rather &quot;concordant&quot; (although stylistically fifths<br/>and fourths define the main stable concords in a neo-medieval<br/>setting).</p><p>An aside on Jay Rahn&apos;s paper on Marchettus of Padua, Joel, a paper<br/>I&apos;ve much enjoyed. Curiously, my Pythagorean-based tuning with that<br/>750.145-cent interval could be taken as a very close approximation of<br/>the way Rahn interprets the intonational system described and<br/>recommended for singers in the _Lucidarium_ of Marchettus (1318).</p><p>In Rahn&apos;s reading, Marchettus is describing the division of the 9:8<br/>whole-tone into &quot;five parts&quot; based on a monochord division, an idea<br/>also discussed by Joe Monzo here and on his excellent Web pages.</p><p>Specifically, Marchettus advocates the use of a small melodic step in<br/>cadences he calls a &quot;diesis&quot; equal to &quot;one of the five parts of a<br/>tone.&quot; Rahn takes this to refer to a monochord division of the 9:8<br/>tone (measured as 81:72) into five unequal parts, with the cadential<br/>diesis equal to about 74:72, or 37:36, about 47.43 cents. Rahn uses a<br/>value rounded up to 48 cents.</p><p>My &quot;Pythagorean enharmonic&quot; tuning has two 12-note chains of pure<br/>fifths at a distance designed to produce some pure sonorities of<br/>14:17:21 (about 0-336.13-701.96 cents). The two chains are therefore<br/>placed at a distance of 459:448, or about 41.99 cents, apart.</p><p>As it happens, this method of &quot;adding pitches&quot; divides a regular<br/>Pythagorean diatonic semitone at 256:243 (~90.22 cents) into the<br/>41.99-cent step I&apos;ve mentioned, plus a larger quartertone-like diesis<br/>at 114688:111537 or about 48.30 cents -- almost identical to Rahn&apos;s<br/>suggested size for this 14th-century step, a Gothic &quot;microinterval&quot; in<br/>this reading of Marchettus.</p><p>Anyway, in an RI view, I find that all of these intervals -- the pure<br/>fifths and fourths, the &quot;pure&quot; and relatively blending 14:17:21<br/>sonorities from a neo-medieval RI perspective, and the yet more<br/>complex ratios like the ones I&apos;ve cited above are all part of a<br/>continuum.</p><p>Note that I refer to 14:17:21 as &quot;pure&quot; in quotes, because it&apos;s an<br/>open question whether a listener taking a perceptual JI viewpoint such<br/>as that often explicated by Dave Keenan would notice anything special<br/>right around 14:17:21 proper, for example a combination-tone effect.</p><p>From my point of view, the RI ratio 14:17:21 is a kind of affectionate<br/>name for a region of &quot;supraminor/submajor&quot; thirds somewhere around<br/>330-342 cents and 360-372 cents -- 14:17 (~336.13 cents) and 17:21<br/>(~365.83 cents) are landmarks for this general region, and sometimes<br/>more specifically for its central portion. I tend to associate the<br/>ratio 63:52 (~332.21 cents) with the lower portion of the region of<br/>&quot;supraminor&quot; thirds, and 28:23 (~340.55 cents) with the upper portion.</p><p>Curiously, while regarding these ratios as &quot;pure,&quot; I do not<br/>necessarily regard other integer-based or irrational intervals in the<br/>region as &quot;impure&quot; or &quot;compromised&quot; -- they are more like fine nuances<br/>on a continuum, with integer-based ratios providing convenient names<br/>for the neighborhood and some of its subregions and gradations.</p><p>In fact, this region is one of my favorites not only in RI systems<br/>(pure fifths and fourths), but in systems with fifths typically<br/>tempered gently wide of pure. What I celebrate is the continuum and<br/>all of its infinitesimal &quot;nuances,&quot; whether defined by integer-based<br/>or irrational ratios.</p><p>Also, from a practical perspective, I suspect as mentioned above that<br/>the timbres I choose often tend to make almost any interval seem<br/>rather &quot;blending,&quot; smoothing over some of the contrasts between very<br/>obviously &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;impure&quot; intervals in the strongly harmonic<br/>timbres often associated with JI.</p><p>To keep a balance, I should add that neo-medieval RI includes some<br/>very important intervals that _are_ &quot;JI&quot; by lots of traditional<br/>standards: 2:3:4 and 6:8:9 sonorities with pure fifths and fourths,<br/>and also &quot;7-based&quot; sonorities such as 12:14:18:21 and 14:18:21:24.</p><p>However, in RI systems and in related temperaments based on irrational<br/>ratios alike, more complex intervals and sonorities are also included<br/>in the continuum of &quot;relative concord,&quot; and their inclusion or<br/>&quot;optimal approximation&quot; celebrated.</p><p>From a JI perspective, one might ask exactly what it means to<br/>&quot;optimize&quot; a complex ratio which might be perceptually<br/>indistinguishable from &quot;tempered&quot; sizes somewhat to either side.</p><p>From an RI perspective, I might reply that including an interval<br/>somewhere in the general vicinity which evokes the &quot;landmark&quot; of the<br/>ratio as an auspicious emblem is one elegant explanation.</p><p>Another side of this same pleasure is finding that a tuning system<br/>includes some interval such as an unanticipated and complex integer<br/>ratio, or some minute difference of size between two intervals clearly<br/>equivalent from any practical viewpoint (e.g. differences of around<br/>0.1 cent, with a special delight if they happen to be defined by<br/>superparticular ratios).</p><p>Here it may be characteristic that while JI-oriented theory often<br/>speaks of &quot;tuning errors&quot; or &quot;deviations,&quot; RI-oriented theory prefers<br/>such terms as &quot;variations&quot; from a given ratio (not to be confused with<br/>statistical measures of &quot;variance&quot;).</p><p>Anyway, thank you Joel and Dave and Julia for this opportunity to seek<br/>a more &quot;nuanced&quot; discussion. This is already a long enough statement,<br/>so I conclude with an invitation to dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38605 href="#38605">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2002 12:44:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thursday, July 11, 2002, at 01:33 , <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;  &quot;M.

It&apos;s always a relief to see a post from you.</p><p>&gt; Thank you very much for reminding me of a post I wrote a bit more than<br/>&gt; a year and a half ago which might indeed suggest a new, and I hope<br/>&gt; kinder and gentler, &quot;nuance&quot; to some of our discussions here --<br/>&gt; including those in which Julia is involved as an accomplished composer<br/>&gt; and our valued guest.</p><p>Perhaps kinder, gentler, mutually respectful, and in the spirit of friendship ?</p><p>&gt; First, a link to the post on &quot;nuancing&quot; we&apos;re discussing:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_16183.html#16183">/tuning/topicId_16183.html#16183</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In that post, I raised the point that some styles of music including<br/>&gt; my &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; or &quot;neo-medieval&quot; approaches might fit some aspects<br/>&gt; traditionally associated with &quot;JI,&quot; but be better viewed as &quot;Rational<br/>&gt; Intonation&quot; or RI.</p><p>I think it&apos;s perfectly possible and more productive to discuss any aspect of microtonal music without ever mentioning the J word. When I came across your posts about RI, CI, etc. it was a revelation of sorts, it almost immediately got me seeing things in new ways without limitations.</p><p>&gt; A hallmark of RI is that ratios with diverse degrees of simplicity or<br/>&gt; complexity such as 3:2 or 4:3, 7:6 or 9:7 or 7:4, 17:14 or 21:17, and<br/>&gt; something like 57344:37179 (about 750.145 cents) are all part of a<br/>&gt; continuum.</p><p>&gt; The concepts of &quot;JI&quot; and &quot;temperament&quot; alike often tend to suggest<br/>&gt; tuning either _at_ or some calculated distance _from_ a given &quot;pure&quot;<br/>&gt; ratio, suggesting a perceptual distinction between a &quot;just&quot; interval<br/>&gt; and a significantly &quot;compromised&quot; one.</p><p>Indeed, Margo you seem to steal (kidding !) thoughts right out of my head ! The distinction is indeed often lost that a temperament, from the Latin &apos;TEMPERAMENTUM&apos;, meaning right proportion, middle way, mean, moderation, does not necessarily have anything to do with any notion of a &apos;Just Intonation&apos; or any notion of a &apos;pure&apos; ratio. I do also get the feeling, which others including Julia possibly share, that the implication is commonly made that anyone not subscribing to &apos;JI&apos; is &apos;compromising&apos; or deluding themselves. For example if I&apos;m considering the tonal possibilities of 17ED2:1 as an temperament, it is a temperament to me for many reasons, of which the proximity to any conceived &apos;pure&apos; ratios is not one.</p><p>&gt; Some treasured discussions with Dave Keenan, both almost two years ago<br/>&gt; and now, have helped me to realize that much of what I do with RI is<br/>&gt; in another category.

I also tentatively labelled the class of scales with symmetrically repeating intervals, as &apos;Generated Intonation&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Also, from a practical perspective, I suspect as mentioned above that<br/>&gt; the timbres I choose often tend to make almost any interval seem<br/>&gt; rather &quot;blending,&quot; smoothing over some of the contrasts between very<br/>&gt; obviously &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;impure&quot; intervals in the strongly harmonic<br/>&gt; timbres often associated with JI.</p><p>Which is one of the primary reasons behind my feeling that leaving out the term &apos;JI&apos; in such a discussion is not only possible, but beneficial. Something like &apos;anomalous saturated suspensions&apos; &lt;<a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm</a>&gt; can be better coped within a broader discussion space, like CI.</p><p>&gt; To keep a balance, I should add that neo-medieval RI includes some<br/>&gt; very important intervals that _are_ &quot;JI&quot; by lots of traditional<br/>&gt; standards: 2:3:4 and 6:8:9 sonorities with pure fifths and fourths,<br/>&gt; and also &quot;7-based&quot; sonorities such as 12:14:18:21 and 14:18:21:24.</p><p>&gt; However, in RI systems and in related temperaments based on irrational<br/>&gt; ratios alike, more complex intervals and sonorities are also included<br/>&gt; in the continuum of &quot;relative concord,&quot; and their inclusion or<br/>&gt; &quot;optimal approximation&quot; celebrated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a JI perspective, one might ask exactly what it means to<br/>&gt; &quot;optimize&quot; a complex ratio which might be perceptually<br/>&gt; indistinguishable from &quot;tempered&quot; sizes somewhat to either side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From an RI perspective, I might reply that including an interval<br/>&gt; somewhere in the general vicinity which evokes the &quot;landmark&quot; of the<br/>&gt; ratio as an auspicious emblem is one elegant explanation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another side of this same pleasure is finding that a tuning system<br/>&gt; includes some interval such as an unanticipated and complex integer<br/>&gt; ratio, or some minute difference of size between two intervals clearly<br/>&gt; equivalent from any practical viewpoint (e.g. differences of around<br/>&gt; 0.1 cent, with a special delight if they happen to be defined by<br/>&gt; superparticular ratios).<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Here it may be characteristic that while JI-oriented theory often<br/>&gt; speaks of &quot;tuning errors&quot; or &quot;deviations,&quot; RI-oriented theory prefers<br/>&gt; such terms as &quot;variations&quot; from a given ratio (not to be confused with<br/>&gt; statistical measures of &quot;variance&quot;).</p><p>Very nicely put !</p><p>&gt; Anyway, thank you Joel and Dave and Julia for this opportunity to seek<br/>&gt; a more &quot;nuanced&quot; discussion.</p><p>&gt;  This is already a long enough statement,</p><p>But very welcome.

For example if I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the tonal possibilities of 17ED2:1 as an<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; temperament, it is a temperament to me for many reasons, of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; which the proximity to any conceived &apos;pure&apos; ratios is not one.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Oh no!  We don&apos;t have to argue about the meaning of &quot;temperament&quot;<br/>&gt; again do<br/>&gt;&gt; we?  Well, you can start off by finding a dictionary that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have a<br/>&gt;&gt; notion of pure tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed! Right proportion of what? Middle way between what? Mean of<br/>&gt; what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is no value judgement here about whether just is better, however<br/>&gt; the rather length OED entry (for example) on the musical meaning of<br/>&gt; the term, specifically includes the words &quot;... consisting in slight<br/>&gt; variations of the pitch of the notes from true or &apos;just&apos; intonation<br/>&gt; ...&quot;.</p><p>Perhaps I can explain with another example. I sometimes examine a scale to look for intervals close to 7ED2:1, nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>&gt; There is likewise no value judgement intended by the use of the term<br/>&gt; &quot;error&quot; to refer to the difference between a tempered interval and<br/>&gt; a nearby just interval.</p><p>There is an easily made perception that a value judgement is made. Do the words &apos;true&apos;, &apos;pure&apos;, or &apos;just&apos; ring any bells ?</p><p>&gt;  The term is standard in mathematics for any<br/>&gt; such deviation from some reference point.</p><p>Exactly. That reference point may or may not even be a rational interval, let alone a JI one.</p><p>&gt;  But I take Margo&apos;s point<br/>&gt; that it might be wise to use another term given the feelings on the<br/>&gt; list.</p><p>I for one would be happy never to hear the words &quot;Just Intonation&apos; again.</p><p>- Joel</p></div><h3><a id=38659 href="#38659">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2002 4:49:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo,</p><p>I could be mistaken, but I found parallels in your ideas<br/>expressed about nuancing &amp; Rational Intonation with sentiments<br/>expressed by Ptolemy and Vincenzo Galilei. To put it another<br/>way, I can see how to use your your ideas to put into practise<br/>their suggestions as gleaned from the quotes cited below. I<br/>think you may be amused by some of this, in particular the last<br/>line in the last paragraph quoted below.</p><p>&apos;In Chapter Two, he (Boethius) jumps into the Harmonics&apos;<br/>discussion of the relationship between sense (hearing) and<br/>reason, noting that &quot;the entire judgement is not to be granted<br/>to the sense of hearing; rather, reason must also play a role. Reason should guide and moderate the erring sense, inasmuch as<br/>the sense-tottering and failing-should be supported, as it were,<br/>by a walking stick.&quot; In Chapter Three, Boethius discusses<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s configuration of the goal of the discipline of<br/>Harmonics: &quot;According to Ptolemy the harmonic scholar directs<br/>his activity in such a way that what the sense estimates, reason<br/>weighs; accordingly, reason searches out ratios to which the<br/>sense expresses no objection.&quot;&apos;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week3sum.html">http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week3sum.html</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;Ptolemy begins the Harmonics stating that &quot;the criteria of<br/>harmonia are hearing and reason, not however in the same way.&quot;<br/>From the beginning Ptolemy links together perception and reason.<br/>Perception is good at judging and making comparisons, but as<br/>distinctions become smaller and finer, judgement can become<br/>deficient. Reason, working through methods and with appropriate<br/>instruments, is able to accurately detect those things that<br/>perception missed. Ptolemy claims that students&apos; methods should<br/>use reasoning, but also never contradict the perception.&apos;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week2sum.html">http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week2sum.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Also see the introduction to Andrew Barker&apos;s &apos;Scientific Method<br/>in Ptolemy&rsquo;s Harmonics&apos;, in PDF at:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://books.cambridge.org/0521553725.htm">http://books.cambridge.org/0521553725.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;Vincenzo Galilei, although his student, was another thorn in<br/>Zarlino&apos;s side. Influenced by Aristoxenus, Galilei challenged<br/>Zarlino&apos;s neo-Pythagorean methods, supporting instead a system<br/>of consonances based entirely on &quot;pure sense experience and<br/>artistic usage.&quot; All intervals, Galilei argued, are natural, not<br/>simply those mathematically determined. In performance, a 5th<br/>that is a bit off the 3:2 ratio is just as useful as one that is<br/>exactly on the mark. He challenged Zarlino&apos;s belief in the<br/>universal harmony of music.</p><p>Galilei was also one of the first to impugn the Pythagorean<br/>myth, namely the harmonious qualities of the numbers 6:8:9:12.<br/>Through numerous experiments, Galilei showed that a 2:1 was not<br/>the only ratio for an octave. With two different coins, the<br/>ratio was 3:1, by altering the tension of a string, the ratio<br/>became 4:1, and by changing the volume of an organ pipe, the<br/>ratio was 8:1. This particular experiment was only a part of<br/>Galilei&apos;s larger empirical approach. Galilei set up an<br/>experiment to test what tuning system was actually used by<br/>musicians. In the end, neither of the two predetermined systems<br/>were used at all in common practice. The ear, Galilei argued,<br/>had no regard for systems. Only the octave itself could be<br/>critically determined. All other intervals were flexible, part<br/>of a continuum.&apos;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week9sum.html">http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week9sum.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Best,<br/>Joel</p></div>
