Almost every author of a harmony<br/>textbook makes a reference to the overtone series, and notes<br/>how &quot;7 and 11 are out of tune, therefore excluded from the<br/>harmonic system&quot;.</p><p>If you don&apos;t believe me, go to a big library and start looking<br/>at one harmony text after another.  You&apos;ll see.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As Partch documents amusingly in _Genesis of a Music_, however,<br/>&gt; &gt; 7 was only embraced by a handful of theorists during the<br/>&gt; &gt; 1600s-1800s.

The term &quot;just intonation&quot; refers specifically to<br/>the so-called &quot;purity&quot; of intervals which sound like those<br/>having small-integer ratios.  If 7 is not admitted into the<br/>system of ratios which describe any given author&apos;s version<br/>of &quot;just intonation&quot;, then can&apos;t it be logically deduced that<br/>that author is saying that &quot;7 isn&apos;t just intonation&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I agree with you that using &quot;5-limit&quot; as a qualifier is<br/>&gt; &gt; much better and more precise.  But there are an awful lot<br/>&gt; &gt; of writers on music-theory who haven&apos;t read Partch, don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; know about my website, and don&apos;t subscribe to any of the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning lists.

Certainly, unless<br/>&gt; someone says so I am hardly going to assume that is what<br/>&gt; they mean, and it seems to me you jump to conclusions if<br/>&gt; you think not discussing seven is the same as having an<br/>&gt; opinion about it.</p><p>Gene, I really don&apos;t want this to flare up into the same kind<br/>of heated debate we had here before.  You and anyone else are<br/>perfectly free to define &quot;just intonation&quot; however you please,<br/>and to include whatever prime-factors into your tunings that<br/>you&apos;d like to have.</p><p>But *HISTORICALLY* (is that enough emphasis?), &quot;just intonation&quot;<br/>refers to 5-limit tuning.  Period.  That didn&apos;t really begin to<br/>change until Parch came along, c. 1930.</p><p>Please try to understand my position on this a little better.<br/>Barbershop Quartet style is based entirely on 7-limit adaptive<br/>tuning, and is perhaps the finest example of 7-limit harmony<br/>in all its sonorous beauty.  And I&apos;ll be the first to call<br/>Barbershop an example of &quot;just intonation&quot;.</p><p>But *MOST* traditional music-theory treatises mean 5-limit<br/>when they say &quot;just intonation&quot;.  As I explained above, most<br/>of the authors who &quot;don&apos;t discuss&quot; 7 do indeed dismiss it<br/>before eliminating from their discussion.

Please post as much about this as you can, or give<br/>some references.</p><p>&gt; JI is nothing more than the use of ratios to generate scales.</p><p>Ah ... but what about that Hammond Organ tuning?   That&apos;s<br/>generated entirely from ratios, but sounds exactly like 12-EDO.<br/>So ... is it 12-EDO, or JI, or something else?  If the latter,<br/>then what?  What would *you* call it?</p><p>Or for another example, how about my &quot;rational Canasta&quot; tuning?<br/>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message 23129<br/>&gt; From:  &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; Date:  Fri May 18, 2001  3:13 pm<br/>&gt; Subject:  Ratios for MIRACLEs (was: Re: second Monzo Canasta Ztar mapping)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_22793.html#23129">/tuning/topicId_22793.html#23129</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So here&apos;s a challenge: can anyone come up with 13-limit<br/>&gt; rational pitch sets which will approximate Blackjack and<br/>&gt; Canasta to good advantage? Then you can use my software<br/>&gt; to put these scales on your computer keyboard, and play away!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Hmmm... that&apos;s pretty weird... looking for a rational<br/>&gt; approximation for subsets of an equal-temperament which<br/>&gt; itself is supposed to be good at approximating ratios...<br/>&gt; I see Escher pictures in my mind...)</p><p>And then in message 23188 I proceeded to present a rational<br/>tuning which is audibly indistinguishable from the 72-EDO<br/>version of the Canasta tuning:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_22793.html#23188">/tuning/topicId_22793.html#23188</a></p><p>But please note: these ratios have nothing to do with the<br/>simple ratios which are implied by Canasta.

For, whereas we saw that<br/>&gt;&gt; peace was needful to free and preserve the commonweal from<br/>&gt;&gt; the many impending dangers, we found all replete with enmities<br/>&gt;&gt; and dissensions; and, above all, the (two) princes, to whom<br/>&gt;&gt; God has entrusted well-nigh the whole direction of events,<br/>&gt;&gt; at enmity with each other. Whereas we deemed it necessary<br/>&gt;&gt; that there should be one fold and one shepherd, for the Lord&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; flock in order to [Page 2] maintain the Christian religion<br/>&gt;&gt; in its integrity, and to confirm within us the hope of heavenly<br/>&gt;&gt; things; the unity of the Christian name was rent and well-nigh<br/>&gt;&gt; torn asunder by schisms, dissensions, heresies.</p><p>Now I really don&apos;t think that my Tuning Dictionary has anything<br/>at all to do with that, excepting that I *am* all for peace<br/>and harmony (enjoy the pun if you&apos;d like).</p><p>All I&apos;m trying to do is assemble a reference that will make it<br/>easier for people who are interested in reading the huge literature<br/>on tuning.</p><p>If you don&apos;t like my definition, fine.  Like I said, write your<br/>own, and I&apos;ll include it.  Actually, I&apos;d *prefer* to include your<br/>dissenting views rather than leave them out.  So, stop with the<br/>knee-jerk-response posts, and send me a real definition of JI<br/>as you know it to be, and it will forever become a part of the<br/>Online Dictionary of Tuning Terms.</p><p>Now ...
