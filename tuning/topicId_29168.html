Either consistency or inconsistency can be musically<br/>attractive, depending on what one is doing.</p><p>For example, one obvious and endearing feature of 13-tET is its<br/>&quot;inconsistency&quot; with some basic Pythagorean and other patterns of<br/>interval arithmetic as defined in the Western European tradition of<br/>composition.</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, an 8:9 whole-tone or major second defines the<br/>difference between a 3:4 fourth and a 2:3 fifth. In 13-tET, however,<br/>the best approximation of 3:4 (5/13 octave, ~462 cents) plus the best<br/>approximation of 8:9 (2/13 octave, ~185 cents) does _not_ add up to<br/>the best approximation of 2:3 (8/13 octave, ~738 cents).</p><p>Further we find that, to use traditional interval names in order to<br/>demonstrate their dubious applicability, two &quot;fourths&quot; at 5/13 octave<br/>add up to an excellent &quot;major sixth&quot; at 10/13 octave (~923 cents), an<br/>interval which I consider a prime attraction of this tuning. It makes<br/>possible some beautiful coloristic sonorities, as well as guiding a<br/>range of cadential resolutions where it expands to the octave.</p><p>Of course, for my typical purposes, 13-tET invites a process of<br/>&quot;Chowningization&quot; to match partials and maximize the consonance of the<br/>8/13-octave and 5/13-octave intervals to get &quot;2:3-like&quot; and &quot;3:4-like&quot;<br/>stability. However, that&apos;s also a stylistic preference, and someone<br/>else might prefer a less &quot;concordant&quot; approach.</p><p>Here consistency can serve two purposes: to caution against evaluating<br/>the tuning of a &quot;6:8:9&quot; in 13-tET by looking only at the isolated<br/>ratios and not how they fit together; and to celebrate some<br/>distinctive aspects of this tuning which break the usual Western<br/>European patterns, and invite new musical approaches.</p><p>For example, I tend to realize a &quot;6:8:9&quot; kind of feeling in 13-tET by<br/>playing a sonority which _looks like_ this pattern on the keyboard,<br/>for example &quot;G3-C4-D4,&quot; actually a rounded 0-462-646 cents. To my ear,<br/>it has an overall &quot;quartal/quintal&quot; quality, and I&apos;ve dubbed it a<br/>&quot;Crunchy Pepper&quot; sonority in honor of Keenan Pepper&apos;s famous article<br/>on chords with a &quot;crunchy&quot; quality.</p><p>(However, in a 13-tET setting, I&apos;m not sure how &quot;crunchy&quot; this<br/>sonority is in a Pepperian interpretation, where &quot;crunchiness&quot; means<br/>the presence of one dramatically &quot;dissonant&quot; interval. Is 7/13 octave<br/>really such a dissonance in this setting? -- I&apos;m not sure. The overall<br/>effect is something like a usual 6:8:9 in another tuning.)</p><p>Since 13-tET is inconsistent for the basic 6:8:9:12 ratios of<br/>Pythagorean tuning, we shouldn&apos;t be too surprised that it also turns<br/>out to be &quot;nonunique&quot; for some elementary 14th-century Western<br/>European cadential patterns.</p><p>A very effective cadence has a sonority with two adjacent 5-step<br/>intervals -- 0-5-10 steps or 0-462-923 cents -- expanding to the basic<br/>trinic concord of 0-8-13 steps or 0-738-1200 cents.</p><p>Interestingly, we might say that the lower 5-step interval in 0-5-10<br/>represents a large &quot;cadential major third&quot; (maybe 7:9 or 10:13), and<br/>the upper 5-step interval a &quot;fourth.&quot;</p><p>The outer 10-step &quot;major sixth,&quot; in contrast, fits a usual paradigm of<br/>neo-Gothic interval sizes just fine. Indeed, just as in medieval<br/>theory, this excellent major sixth is equal to a &quot;tone-plus-fifth&quot;<br/>(_tonus cum diapente_), that is, an 8-step &quot;fifth&quot; plus a 2-step<br/>&quot;whole-tone.&quot;</p><p>Thus a full appreciation of 13-tET from a neo-medieval kind of<br/>perspective involves recognizing both the inconsistent/nonunique<br/>aspects of the tuning, and some more &quot;conventional&quot; ones. The mix of<br/>familiar and unfamiliar patterns is a big enticement to draw me in.</p><p>If we take consistency as a _descriptive_ tool to note some patterns<br/>of a tuning, rather than _prescriptive_ tool to say what&apos;s musically<br/>fitting apart from a given style, then it can enhance both our<br/>understanding of the patterns in question and our ability to make more<br/>informed musical choices.</p><p>Happily, Paul and Dan, I don&apos;t see any inevitable conflict between<br/>your ways of viewing this: when and where one happens to be seeking a<br/>fit with classic &quot;n-limit&quot; JI systems, consistency _is_ one very<br/>relevant facet of &quot;goodness to fit.&quot; In a decatonic setting, for<br/>example, it makes sense to verify the best approximations of the<br/>ratios in a 4:5:6:7 tetrad can indeed all be combined at once in a<br/>tuning we are examining -- or that the tuning set is large enough that<br/>this issue may be less significant (a factor you&apos;ve noted, Paul).</p><p>Similarly, I would take harmonic entropy as an approach to musical<br/>consonance/dissonance or simplicity/complexity which itself does not<br/>prescribe whether &quot;dissonance&quot; should be minimized or maximized, but<br/>looks at some of the factors which may affect the perception of a<br/>given interval or sonority in a given type of timbre.</p><p>For example, from some of my reading of this theory, I might guess<br/>that I often like ratios at once rather complex and relatively<br/>&quot;concordant,&quot; adjusting timbre to &quot;pastelize&quot; (reduce sharply defined<br/>clashing or matching of partials) concord/discord. With 13-tET, I go a<br/>bit further, typically &quot;Chowningizing&quot; to move the &quot;third partial&quot;<br/>close to 8/13 octave or around 738 cents.</p><p>This raises an important question: to what degree might my appraisal<br/>of a ratio around 9:7 (~435.08 cents) as &quot;relatively concordant&quot;<br/>reflect my frequent practice of pastelizing to get an effect of<br/>richness and complexity while muting the tension between the fourth<br/>and fifth partials? These remarks might apply with even more force to<br/>something like the 17-tET major third at 6/17 octave or ~423.53 cents,<br/>which can feel quite &quot;rich but relatively concordant&quot; in a pastelized<br/>kind of texture.</p><p>Here I should add that something like F#3-Bb3-Eb4 before E3-B3-E4 also<br/>sounds &quot;in tune&quot; in 1/4-comma meantone, with &quot;major thirds&quot; at 25:32<br/>and &quot;major sixths&quot; at 75:128 (~427 cents and ~931 cents), likely in<br/>part because of the cadential context, and maybe in part because the<br/>&quot;near-7:9:12&quot; effect might suggest something like a Partchian<br/>&quot;otonality.&quot;</p><p>By the way, Paul, maybe your &quot;consistency&quot; concept could be viewed as<br/>one subset of a more general concept of &quot;collocation&quot; -- can all the<br/>relevant ratios of this tuning for a given desired sonority be<br/>combined above the same note at the same time; and, if so, in how many<br/>positions?</p><p>It seems to me that the &quot;collocation&quot; concept could be applied to<br/>almost any type of tuning, although &quot;consistency&quot; might be n-tET<br/>specific.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. As was mentioned in a recent thread, how one looks at 29-tET may<br/>either make irrelevant or bring to the forefront the possible issue of<br/>a &quot;syntonic comma&quot; equivalent. In a neo-Gothic setting, 29-tET is like<br/>Pythagorean in having a regular or eventone structure: usual major and<br/>minor thirds are defined simply as four fifths up and three fourths<br/>up, respectively, without such complications. In 29-tET, from this<br/>viewpoint, the ~41.38-cent diesis is analogous to the Pythagorean<br/>comma or the enharmonic diesis in meantone, serving like the latter as<br/>a distinct kind of melodic &quot;step.&quot; However, if one seeks to use as the<br/>usual thirds the closest approximations of ratios of 5 -- from a<br/>neo-Gothic viewpoint, also approximations of 14:17 and 17:21 or the<br/>like -- then the diesis becomes in effect equivalent to a &quot;syntonic<br/>comma&quot; of 41 cents, not necessarily the most desirable result for<br/>classic 5-limit music, as you commented, Paul.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2001 2:12:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This raises an important question: to what degree might my appraisal<br/>&gt; of a ratio around 9:7 (~435.08 cents) as &quot;relatively concordant&quot;<br/>&gt; reflect my frequent practice of pastelizing to get an effect of<br/>&gt; richness and complexity while muting the tension between the fourth<br/>&gt; and fifth partials?</p><p>Here&apos;s an experiment you can use to answer this question: start with<br/>a 4:5, and gradually increase the size of the interval, listening<br/>carefully every step of the way, to 7:9 and beyond. Do you hear the<br/>interval becoming more concordant as you approach 7:9, and more<br/>discordant as you move beyond it? If not, then pastelization might be<br/>playing a strong role here. Personally, even with strongly harmonic<br/>timbres, I don&apos;t find 7:9 as an isolated dyad to be a local minimum<br/>of discordance in low or medium registers, but in high registers I do.</p><p>&gt; Here I should add that something like F#3-Bb3-Eb4 before E3-B3-E4<br/>also<br/>&gt; sounds &quot;in tune&quot; in 1/4-comma meantone, with &quot;major thirds&quot; at 25:32<br/>&gt; and &quot;major sixths&quot; at 75:128 (~427 cents and ~931 cents), likely in<br/>&gt; part because of the cadential context, and maybe in part because the<br/>&gt; &quot;near-7:9:12&quot; effect might suggest something like a Partchian<br/>&gt; &quot;otonality.&quot;</p><p>Yes, I think the ear will tend to pick up on the 7:9:12 pattern.</p><p>&gt; By the way, Paul, maybe your &quot;consistency&quot; concept could be viewed<br/>as<br/>&gt; one subset of a more general concept of &quot;collocation&quot; -- can all the<br/>&gt; relevant ratios of this tuning for a given desired sonority be<br/>&gt; combined above the same note at the same time; and, if so, in how<br/>many<br/>&gt; positions?</p><p>I don&apos;t see how consistency could be viewed as a subset of this<br/>concept.</p><p>&gt; It seems to me that the &quot;collocation&quot; concept could be applied to<br/>&gt; almost any type of tuning, although &quot;consistency&quot; might be n-tET<br/>&gt; specific.</p><p>Graham Breed (and probably Dave Keenan) have applied the consistency<br/>concept to linear temperaments as well -- but I never understood that<br/>because you can always find better approximations if you go far<br/>enough out in the chain of generators.</p></div>
