(Yes,<br/>&gt;I<br/>&gt; like 17, but since I can have it as a subset of 34, I&apos;ll go with<br/>the<br/>&gt; latter.)</p><p>To me, 19 and 31 tend to sound soggy. 19 is useless to me, no median<br/>third, but 31 sports the sevens and is audibly more suited to<br/>certain musics than 34 is. 19, 31, 34, 46: milk, beer, wine, and ?</p><p>I think we discussed some time ago how 17 feels like a subset of<br/>something else- I wasn&apos;t up for 34 at the time because of the<br/>absence of 7/4 but I&apos;ve changed my mind because intervals literally<br/>incorporating the 7th partial seem loathe to move or mingle outside<br/>the family, just as it&apos;s a major color decision in additive<br/>synthesis to create a strong 7th partial.</p><p>Also, the theoretical foundation of the way I make my chords<br/>taller is not by stacking thirds, but by adding intervals with an<br/>ear on the physical timbre of the chord, eg adding 11/10 to 14/11.<br/>Example:  &quot;G-E-C-D&quot; might have a &quot;G&quot; of 182/121 (makes a difference<br/>from 3/2 in this approach, try it), an &quot;E&quot; of 14/11 and a &quot;D&quot; of<br/>11/10 (voiced 91/121, 14/11, 2/1, 22/10).</p><p>34 works admirably for this approach because of its &quot;harmonic-mean&quot;<br/>nature, I believe. The high third is a 23/18 (less than .9 cents off<br/>even in straight EDO), the harmonic mean of 14/11 and 9/7; the dark<br/>minor third is 20/17 (within one cent), the harmonic mean of 13/11<br/>and 7/6, and so on. So these &quot;mean&quot; intervals, though not directly<br/>percieved as &quot;Just&quot;, are &quot;softened&quot; by more distantly percieved<br/>literal consonances in the audible range, while at the same<br/>time lending themselves to different interpretations in the lower<br/>harmonics.</p><p>Carl calls all this &quot;eye of newt&quot; but I keep getting comments<br/>from listeners which seem to confirm that it all works precisely as<br/>intended, so, whatever. :-).</p><p>Anyway as far as other kinds of music, I find 34 eerily reminiscent<br/>of the intonational flavor of pre-war Eastern European orchestral<br/>recordings (Melodiya), and of old recordings of Romantic music in<br/>general. A couple of artists I know have made remarks to similar<br/>effect, &quot;sounds like...1930!&quot;, perhaps remarkable considering the<br/>highly synthetic timbres I use.</p><p> &gt; &gt; The kicker for me is the &quot;median&quot; intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt; which are superb- 27/22 is only 1.6 cents  flat in 34-EDO, which<br/>&gt; &gt; means you can have some pure in a WT, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My 34-WT has 4 of these with less than 1 cent error and 4 more<br/>&gt;with<br/>&gt; ~1.9 cents error.  In other keys the interval of 10deg34-WT comes<br/>&gt; very close to 11/9, 16/13, or 39/32, so in different keys you get<br/>&gt; neutral 3rds in different flavors.</p><p>That&apos;s very nice indeed- is your 34-WT in the Scala archive?

Your point about melodic<br/>effectiveness is very interesting, especially from my point of<br/>hearing, as you&apos;re nailing intervals I use heavily, but I have grave<br/>misgivings about &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; as a measure of<br/>consonance- maybe it&apos;s a matter of terminology. For you see,<br/>I find these intervals very consonant, and as far as I can tell,<br/>so does pretty much everyone else I come in contact with in everyday<br/>musical life.</p><p>If, however, the &quot;dissonance&quot; referred to in HE is a kind of<br/>uncertainty or ambiguity as to an interval&apos;s status vis a vis the<br/>first dozen partials, then I&apos;d have to agree that these intervals<br/>are almost maximally &quot;dissonant&quot; in that respect. My take on it is<br/>that these intervals &quot;float&quot; in relationship to the lower partials,<br/>while at the same time being truly consonant &quot;in the corner of the<br/>eye&quot;, or the edge of the ear, so to speak.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There isn&apos;t and shouldn&apos;t be a universal tuning, in my<br/>&gt;&gt;opinion,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I believe that 34 is ideal for a great deal of music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; My four favorite divisions below 72 are 19, 31, 34, and 46.<br/>&gt; (Yes, I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like 17, but since I can have it as a subset of 34, I&apos;ll go<br/>&gt;with<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; latter.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To me, 19 and 31 tend to sound soggy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Presumably on account of their melodic properties, I would think.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve observed that these may require a &quot;break-in&quot; period during<br/>which<br/>&gt; one&apos;s ears become accustomed to the smaller-than-optimal major<br/>&gt;2nds<br/>&gt; and larger minor 2nds.</p><p>Harmonically, too- to my ears, 5/4 tolerates almost no downward<br/>tempering, quickly clamoring to be a median third, and flattened<br/>3/2&apos;s are a specific flavor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 19 is useless to me, no median<br/>&gt; &gt; third,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s one of the reasons I&apos;ve avoided 19-ET, preferring a multi-<br/>&gt; purpose well-temperament with 3 extra tones for the 11&apos;s (19+3WT).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I assume that you don&apos;t like 22, either.  I dislike 22 on account<br/>&gt;of<br/>&gt; the heavy tempering of the minor 3rd (and its small major 3rd<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; help, either).  IMO, the first wide-fifth EDO that delivers the<br/>&gt;goods<br/>&gt; is 34.</p><p> I think 22 just sounds... kind of silly, actually. To each his<br/>own, of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but 31 sports the sevens and is audibly more suited to<br/>&gt; &gt; certain musics than 34 is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  For me, it&apos;s not a matter of preferring one over the other,<br/>&gt;but<br/>&gt; rather recognizing that each has different strengths and<br/>&gt;weaknesses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 19, 31, 34, 46: milk, beer, wine, and ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ??</p><p>19 sounds like milk, 31 like beer, 34 like wine, and I don&apos;t know<br/>about 46. 22 sounds like some kind of artificially flavored soda-pop.<br/>Different strokes, of course.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think we discussed some time ago how 17 feels like a subset of<br/>&gt; &gt; something else- I wasn&apos;t up for 34 at the time because of the<br/>&gt; &gt; absence of 7/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re not the only one to think that.  When I first looked at the<br/>&gt;34<br/>&gt; division, I thought that the poor representation of 7 was a fatal<br/>&gt; flaw.  Paul Erlich also eliminated 34 from consideration in his 22-<br/>&gt; tone (pajara) paper because of 7-limit inconsistency and concluded<br/>&gt; that 22-ET was the best, most practical, implementation of pajara.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, my recent listening-test survey on this list has proved<br/>&gt; otherwise, due in large part to the fact that we seem to accept a<br/>&gt; larger positive than negative error for 4:7 (possibly because of<br/>&gt;our<br/>&gt; extensive exposure to 12-ET, with its 600-cent tritone).</p><p>Just calculating roughly in my head, I would guess that sharpening<br/>the 7/4 would actually create more overall dissonance in the first<br/>half-dozen partials, due to critical bandwidth interactions. To me,<br/>the thing with lowering the 7/4 much is that it simply doesn&apos;t sound<br/>like a seventh anymore, but wants to be a 15/9 or something like<br/>that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t help noticing a resemblance between these observations and<br/>&gt; the introductory section of my 17-tone paper -- I think I&apos;ve just<br/>&gt; laid out the opening thoughts for a 34-tone paper. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but I&apos;ve changed my mind because intervals literally<br/>&gt; &gt; incorporating the 7th partial seem loathe to move or mingle<br/>outside<br/>&gt; &gt; the family, just as it&apos;s a major color decision in additive<br/>&gt; &gt; synthesis to create a strong 7th partial.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, the theoretical foundation of the way I make my chords<br/>&gt; &gt; taller is not by stacking thirds, but by adding intervals with an<br/>&gt; &gt; ear on the physical timbre of the chord, eg adding 11/10 to<br/>&gt; 14/11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The resultant 7/5 looks nice on paper; I&apos;ll have to try it.</p><p>You don&apos;t know how relieved I am to find that you noticed the 7/5<br/>immediately. :-) Because the children and desires of intervals and<br/>chords, whether fulfulled or thwarted, are innate, and that&apos;s what<br/>drives my whole approach- this particular chord is designed to do<br/>the Holst/sci-fi &quot;tritone&quot; thingy, you know which one I mean, in the<br/>smoothest and most limpid way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Example:  &quot;G-E-C-D&quot; might have a &quot;G&quot; of 182/121 (makes a<br/>&gt;difference<br/>&gt; &gt; from 3/2 in this approach, try it), an &quot;E&quot; of 14/11 and a &quot;D&quot; of<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/10 (voiced 91/121, 14/11, 2/1, 22/10).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Coincidentally, a few days ago I was wondering what sort of triad<br/>&gt;I<br/>&gt; would get with stacked 3rds of 14/11 and 13/11 (which gives a 5th<br/>of<br/>&gt; 182/121), but I haven&apos;t had a chance to try it.  Now I&apos;m really<br/>&gt; curious!</p><p>I am finding in this case that tempering the x/lls and their<br/>children (I throw in harmonic means as scale steps) up or down to<br/>taste by 364/363, the difference between 182/121 and 3/2, creates a<br/>more coherent pallette. Actually &quot;impurity&quot; is better for me,<br/>because I&apos;m loading specific frequency regions with energy- if<br/>they&apos;re about 4-8 cents, more or less, wide, the whole thing seems<br/>to work better. Absence of phase cancellation may be involved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 34 works admirably for this approach because of its &quot;harmonic-<br/>&gt;mean&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; nature, I believe. The high third is a 23/18 (less than .9 cents<br/>&gt; off<br/>&gt; &gt; even in straight EDO), the harmonic mean of 14/11 and 9/7; the<br/>dark<br/>&gt; &gt; minor third is 20/17 (within one cent), the harmonic mean of<br/>13/11<br/>&gt; &gt; and 7/6, and so on. So these &quot;mean&quot; intervals, though not<br/>directly<br/>&gt; &gt; percieved as &quot;Just&quot;, are &quot;softened&quot; by more distantly percieved<br/>&gt; &gt; literal consonances in the audible range, while at the same<br/>&gt; &gt; time lending themselves to different interpretations in the lower<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonics.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl calls all this &quot;eye of newt&quot; but I keep getting comments<br/>&gt; &gt; from listeners which seem to confirm that it all works precisely<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; intended, so, whatever. :-).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll have to try these out.  It&apos;s amazing how many different<br/>&gt; approaches to tonality can be found when you think outside the 12-<br/>&gt;box.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway as far as other kinds of music, I find 34 eerily<br/>reminiscent<br/>&gt; &gt; of the intonational flavor of pre-war Eastern European<br/>orchestral<br/>&gt; &gt; recordings (Melodiya), and of old recordings of Romantic music<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; general. A couple of artists I know have made remarks to similar<br/>&gt; &gt; effect, &quot;sounds like...1930!&quot;, perhaps remarkable considering<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; highly synthetic timbres I use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s interesting.  Could you direct me to any sound files for<br/>this?</p><p>I&apos;ll be posting some music this week- technically my DVD should be<br/>done &quot;any day now&quot; but the video artists are all on the seaside...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The kicker for me is the &quot;median&quot; intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are superb- 27/22 is only 1.6 cents  flat in 34-EDO,<br/>&gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means you can have some pure in a WT, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; My 34-WT has 4 of these with less than 1 cent error and 4 more<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ~1.9 cents error.  In other keys the interval of 10deg34-WT<br/>&gt;comes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; very close to 11/9, 16/13, or 39/32, so in different keys you<br/>&gt;get<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; neutral 3rds in different flavors.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s very nice indeed- is your 34-WT in the Scala archive? I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; find it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know of any procedure for putting tunings in the Scala<br/>&gt; archive, so it&apos;s probably not there.</p><p>I don&apos;t either, I guess you ask Manuel?</p><p>&gt;However, I&apos;ve put .scl files<br/>&gt; for my best tunings here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/</a><br/>&gt; so you can look at the descriptions and see what else I&apos;ve been up<br/>&gt; to.

Because I like the &quot;minor<br/>&gt; ninth&quot; I was doing it harmonically as well as melodically and it<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t take long to discover that what I kept arriving at was 25/24.<br/>&gt; When I typed this interval and other goodies into google, I found<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter and this whole community.</p><p>Wow, that&apos;s wild!  (But not as wild as the ride I&apos;m about to take you<br/>on.)</p><p>I guess one should never underestimate the power of a lowly<br/>semitone.  I&apos;m still amazed (and amused) that, a few years back,<br/>somebody actually suggested naming one after me, and that the idea<br/>actually caught on (before I learned about it):<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_27028.html#27062">/tuning/topicId_27028.html#27062</a><br/>The double irony in this is: 1) that I&apos;ve never had any interest in<br/>using Miracle for anything (other than as the basis for a keyboard<br/>layout); and 2) that &quot;somebody&quot; to whom I referred is none other than<br/>Dave Keenan, who has since voiced his objection to labeling tunings<br/>with names that have nothing to do with their actual properties.</p><p>Mention of a keyboard layout reminded me of something.  Here&apos;s my<br/>Pajara keyboard design, with the keys labeled for 34 &amp; 46:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KbPaj34-46.gif<br/>Since it&apos;s not clear what color arrangement would be most meaningful<br/>in the all of the divisions that this keyboard will handle, the key<br/>colors in the outer rows are only tentative.</p><p>I just thought of something funny about yet another kind of semitone:<br/>Why not name the pajara generator using the term &quot;erlich&quot; (lower case<br/>e) after its discoverer Paul Erlich?</p><p>Hang on; there&apos;s more.  I was also thinking, to make the triangle<br/>complete, that it was fitting for Paul Erlich to propose naming a<br/>family of tunings with a minor 3rd generator and a low 7 mapping<br/>(which, in Gene&apos;s words, would be &quot;34 trying to act like 19, not 22&quot;)<br/>after Dave Keenan -- except that Dave objected and spoiled all the<br/>fun (so now it&apos;s called &quot;keemun&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, to get back to Margo and the 17-tone revolution, she and I<br/>had briefly discussed the possibility that eastern Europe and western<br/>Asia might have been more fertile ground than western Europe for wide-<br/>fifth tunings, particularly 17 and the neutral (median) 3rds it<br/>contains, but apart from the mention of Zalzal&apos;s 11th-harmonic<br/>fretting (by both Helmholtz and Partch), we had very little to go<br/>on.  I&apos;m happy to see that our suspicions were correct.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In July 2002 (after I wrote the paper) I had a discussion with<br/>Paul<br/>&gt; &gt; Erlich on the harmonic entropy list.  Paul adjusted variables in<br/>his<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic entropy program to produce a graph that closely<br/>corresponded<br/>&gt; &gt; to observations I had made many years earlier with a retunable<br/>&gt; &gt; electronic organ, in which I had determined specific interval<br/>sizes<br/>&gt; &gt; as points of local maximum dissonance.  As it turned out, the<br/>global<br/>&gt; &gt; maximum harmonic entropy is at 67 cents in this graph (close to<br/>70<br/>&gt; &gt; cents).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;ll be interested to learn that the local HE maximum between<br/>5/4<br/>&gt; &gt; and 9/7 is at 422 cents in this graph, which is very close to<br/>23/18<br/>&gt; &gt; (which you mentioned below).  Also, there is a slightly greater<br/>local<br/>&gt; &gt; HE maximum between 6/5 and 5/4 at 356 cents, which is very close<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; 27/22 (which you also mentioned).  (There&apos;s a second peak, almost<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; great, at 340 cents, so you might want to listen to 28/23 in JI<br/>or 46-<br/>&gt; &gt; ET, and especially to the 18:23:28 triad, which is isoharmonic.)<br/>&gt; &gt; This supports a point of speculation in my paper that intervals<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; are melodically most effective are close to local maximum points<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonance, discord, or disorder (i.e., harmonic entropy).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very interesting indeed, to put it mildly. I&apos;m very familiar with<br/>&gt; 28/23, using it a great deal (take a look at 24/23, 25/23, 26/23,<br/>&gt; 27/23, 28/23 in light of a 34 WT).</p><p>Ah, yes!  For example, I see that the 18:23:28 triad I suggested has<br/>a maximum error &lt;7 cents with C taken as 16 (or 1/1).</p><p>&gt; Your point about melodic<br/>&gt; effectiveness is very interesting, especially from my point of<br/>&gt; hearing, as you&apos;re nailing intervals I use heavily, but I have grave<br/>&gt; misgivings about &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; as a measure of<br/>&gt; consonance- maybe it&apos;s a matter of terminology. For you see,<br/>&gt; I find these intervals very consonant, and as far as I can tell,<br/>&gt; so does pretty much everyone else I come in contact with in<br/>everyday<br/>&gt; musical life.</p><p>So far harmonic entropy has been correlated to consonance only when<br/>considering intervals, and only in isolation.  As soon as you hear<br/>these intervals in a musical context, then one&apos;s perception of<br/>consonance and dissonance is also affected by other factors.  In<br/>classical harmony a 3:4 is often considered dissonant, yet<br/>acoustically it&apos;s near the top of the list of consonant intervals.</p><p>&gt; If, however, the &quot;dissonance&quot; referred to in HE is a kind of<br/>&gt; uncertainty or ambiguity as to an interval&apos;s status vis a vis the<br/>&gt; first dozen partials, then I&apos;d have to agree that these intervals<br/>&gt; are almost maximally &quot;dissonant&quot; in that respect. My take on it is<br/>&gt; that these intervals &quot;float&quot; in relationship to the lower partials,<br/>&gt; while at the same time being truly consonant &quot;in the corner of the<br/>&gt; eye&quot;, or the edge of the ear, so to speak.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There isn&apos;t and shouldn&apos;t be a universal tuning, in my<br/>opinion,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I believe that 34 is ideal for a great deal of music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My four favorite divisions below 72 are 19, 31, 34, and 46.<br/>(Yes, I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like 17, but since I can have it as a subset of 34, I&apos;ll go<br/>with the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; latter.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To me, 19 and 31 tend to sound soggy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Presumably on account of their melodic properties, I would<br/>think.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve observed that these may require a &quot;break-in&quot; period during<br/>which<br/>&gt; &gt; one&apos;s ears become accustomed to the smaller-than-optimal major<br/>2nds<br/>&gt; &gt; and larger minor 2nds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonically, too- to my ears, 5/4 tolerates almost no downward<br/>&gt; tempering, quickly clamoring to be a median third, and flattened<br/>&gt; 3/2&apos;s are a specific flavor.</p><p>Yep, that&apos;s &quot;soggy&quot; all right!  :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19 is useless to me, no median<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; third,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s one of the reasons I&apos;ve avoided 19-ET, preferring a multi-<br/>&gt; &gt; purpose well-temperament with 3 extra tones for the 11&apos;s (19+3WT).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I assume that you don&apos;t like 22, either.  I dislike 22 on account<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; the heavy tempering of the minor 3rd (and its small major 3rd<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; help, either).  IMO, the first wide-fifth EDO that delivers the<br/>goods<br/>&gt; &gt; is 34.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  I think 22 just sounds... kind of silly, actually. To each his<br/>&gt; own, of course.</p><p>Just so others don&apos;t get the wrong impression, I wouldn&apos;t say that 19<br/>or 22 are worthless, only that it takes some time to get used to<br/>them, whereas some other divisions sound good &quot;right out of the box.&quot;</p><p>&gt; ... To me,<br/>&gt; the thing with lowering the 7/4 much is that it simply doesn&apos;t<br/>sound<br/>&gt; like a seventh anymore, but wants to be a 15/9 or something like<br/>&gt; that.</p><p>Perhaps a 12/7.  In 19 you have a single interval trying to be both<br/>7:12 and 4:7; this works much better if the 19 tones are well-<br/>tempered.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the theoretical foundation of the way I make my chords<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; taller is not by stacking thirds, but by adding intervals with<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ear on the physical timbre of the chord, eg adding 11/10 to<br/>&gt; &gt; 14/11.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The resultant 7/5 looks nice on paper; I&apos;ll have to try it.</p><p>(I did, and it is nice!)</p><p>&gt; You don&apos;t know how relieved I am to find that you noticed the 7/5<br/>&gt; immediately. :-) Because the children and desires of intervals and<br/>&gt; chords, whether fulfulled or thwarted, are innate, and that&apos;s what<br/>&gt; drives my whole approach- this particular chord is designed to do<br/>&gt; the Holst/sci-fi &quot;tritone&quot; thingy, you know which one I mean, in<br/>the<br/>&gt; smoothest and most limpid way.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway as far as other kinds of music, I find 34 eerily<br/>reminiscent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the intonational flavor of pre-war Eastern European<br/>orchestral<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; recordings (Melodiya), and of old recordings of Romantic music<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; general. A couple of artists I know have made remarks to<br/>similar<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; effect, &quot;sounds like...1930!&quot;, perhaps remarkable considering<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; highly synthetic timbres I use.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s interesting.

That is why the low dip<br/>&gt; for 3/2 has such a wide bell-curve on either side of it.</p><p>The vast majority of my experience with human listeners<br/>indicates that they percieve things in terms of brightness,<br/>boldness, dullness, fearfulness, languidity, sweetness,<br/>sourness...etc.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As the pitch-size of the ratios under consideration<br/>&gt; get farther away from exactly 3/2 in either direction<br/>&gt; (i.e., larger or smaller), the odds of a listener<br/>&gt; perceiving it as a 3/2 will decrease up to the point<br/>&gt; of maximum HE (the highest points on the chart next<br/>&gt; to the 3/2 dip) -- on the chart on the Encyclopedia<br/>&gt; page, Paul labeled these 639 and 765 cents.

Where the 5 and 7 are mapped vary from one temperament to another, but the keyboard layout is still in a sense the same.</p><p>The big difference between keyboard layouts, or mappings, or whatever you want to call them, is where the octave gets mapped; this determines which temperaments can be comfortably accommodated by the layout, and which ones end up being awkward. In some ways the main difference between keyboard layouts is how many periods are in an octave. So you could, in theory, use a Bosanquet, Fokker, Wicki, or Hanson keyboard for any temperament with a single period to the octave, but if you do that with a pajara or lemba keyboard, you&apos;ll end up not using half the keys.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve set the period, the generator is one of the two keys closest to the line connecting the two ends of the period (any other position will leave keys unused). So in theory you could map any temperament to any keyboard layout having the right number of periods per octave. But try tuning George Secor&apos;s pajara keyboard to lemba temperament, and you&apos;ll find it&apos;s an awkward fit. 5/4 ends up to the right of 3/2, and 4/3 is about midway between 5/4 and 2/1.

So<br/>you<br/>&gt; could, in theory, use a Bosanquet, Fokker, Wicki, or Hanson<br/>keyboard for<br/>&gt; any temperament with a single period to the octave, but if you do<br/>that<br/>&gt; with a pajara or lemba keyboard, you&apos;ll end up not using half the<br/>keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once you&apos;ve set the period, the generator is one of the two keys<br/>closest<br/>&gt; to the line connecting the two ends of the period (any other<br/>position<br/>&gt; will leave keys unused). So in theory you could map any temperament<br/>to<br/>&gt; any keyboard layout having the right number of periods per octave.<br/>But<br/>&gt; try tuning George Secor&apos;s pajara keyboard to lemba temperament, and<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll find it&apos;s an awkward fit. 5/4 ends up to the right of 3/2,<br/>and<br/>&gt; 4/3 is about midway between 5/4 and 2/1. The 10-note lemba MOS<br/>requires<br/>&gt; you to skip back and forth between keys labeled C E\! C||\ F D F||\<br/>&gt; B\!!/ G B\! A!!/ C.</p><p>Another example of an awkward fit is that if you attempt to map<br/>Miracle onto the keys of a Bosanquet keyboard, it will not only<br/>require a greater octave distance, but the octaves will go off at an<br/>angle and start to disappear off the edge of the keyboard.  Even if<br/>you have a huge number of keys/octave, having to play along an angle<br/>as one goes up and down the range of the keyboard is going to be<br/>uncomfortable enough that I expect you&apos;d wind up with a backache.</p><p>&gt; So there&apos;s definitely a sense in which, even though one keyboard<br/>layout<br/>&gt; is mathematically as good as any other, the physical arrangement of<br/>the<br/>&gt; keys is more suitable for some temperaments than others.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=72694 href="#72694">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

I can think of two ways.</p><p>1) To give you the most &quot;generalized&quot; answer possible, let&apos;s say that<br/>you&apos;re starting out with a two-dimensional (square) grid of<br/>indefinite size, having adjacent tones separated by one particular<br/>interval along one direction of the grid and another interval in the<br/>perpendicular direction.  Your choice of intervals, along with the<br/>period, is going to determine the outcome.  These intervals don&apos;t<br/>have to be consonances; they could be small intervals that occur as<br/>scale steps in some scale subset of a tuning, e.g., a major 2nd and<br/>minor 2nd.  (You would want small intervals between adjacent keys of<br/>a keyboard, wouldn&apos;t you?)  Now, to restate your question, is either<br/>of these intervals, or some other interval, the generator for these<br/>tones?  Let&apos;s find out.</p><p>Extend the grid sufficiently so that you&apos;ll find two tones separated<br/>by the interval of a period (octave, 1/2-octave, etc.), and if<br/>there&apos;s more than one grid vector having this property, then choose<br/>one.  Draw a line connecting the two points in the grid representing<br/>a period.  Choose one of these points as the origin or &quot;tonic&quot;.</p><p>Imagine that lines, parallel to your original line, are drawn through<br/>each of the other points on the grid.  Identify those points for<br/>which these imaginary lines are nearest the original line.  The<br/>interval between one of these points (choose one) and the origin is<br/>your generator.  Which of these points to choose, you ask?  It<br/>doesn&apos;t matter; it&apos;s your choice, and that&apos;s mostly a matter of how<br/>you want to conceptualize it.  For example, is the meantone generator<br/>a 5th or a 4th?  Is the pajara generator ~105c, or ~490c, or ~710c,<br/>or ~1095c?  When you perform period-reduction, these generators will<br/>generate the same tones.</p><p>2) Or, if you like, you can do it this way.  Choose two different<br/>octave divisions (one not a subset of the other) that you would like<br/>to have on a single keyboard.  Determine whether they both contain<br/>one or more tones 1/n-octave, to see whether the period will be a<br/>fraction of an octave.  Set tone # zero (the origin) to the same<br/>pitch in both divisions and find the smallest difference (absolute<br/>value &gt;0) in pitch between the two divisions.  The interval between<br/>these tones and the origin is the generator.</p><p>&gt; I think it would be more fruitful to classify keyboard<br/>&gt; layouts in terms of how the first n primes are mapped<br/>&gt; relative to 1.  Say, a list showing the order of primes<br/>&gt; as a ray goes from 1 to 3 and then clockwise 360deg.<br/>&gt; Distances (straight-line from 1) to each prime could also<br/>&gt; be given under the assumption that, say, the keyboard is<br/>&gt; a Cartesian grid (perfectly square).

Generally, a good layout is one that allows you to easily pick out consonant chords (however you define those) and commonly used melodic steps.

If the generator is irrational (as in whatever the pajara equivalent of &quot;golden meantone&quot; would be), you won&apos;t ever get back to the origin. If you look at just the &quot;upward&quot; component of the generator (noting that the period can only get you horizontal motion), you can see that you&apos;ll keep going farther from the origin.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But the thing I was trying to point out is just that if you<br/>&gt;&gt; use 7 degrees as your generator (or anything other than 3 or<br/>&gt;&gt; 14, within that period), many of the notes of the keyboard<br/>&gt;&gt; will be unused.

Both thirds (MR, RK) would be a large leap on the Wicki (if you had it tuned to a schismatic temperament), while only the fifth (TK) is a good-sized leap on the Bosanquet.

The Janko keyboard is an interesting case because it&apos;s designed for a specific temperament and essentially only has two rows. You could call it a 0/1 keyboard with a period of 1/6 octave and a generator of 1/12 octave, although it also supports the same fingering patterns as the 3/7 keyboards.</p></div><h3><a id=72816 href="#72816">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2007 12:35:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
