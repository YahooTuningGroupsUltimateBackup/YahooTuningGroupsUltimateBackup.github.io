The lines below may interest you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Couldn&apos;t it appear then as madness to claim there exists an exact<br/>&gt; mathematical/technological specification of Bach&apos;s &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;<br/>&gt; harpsichord temperament???<br/>&gt;<br/>And yes, some do think it madness for us to parcel things out in such fine<br/>amounts.  Ironically, that is what the Baroque temperament masters did, often<br/>with beautifully drawn monochords, as was the one drawn for publication for<br/>Werckmeister.</p><p>&gt; For the (N+1)/N of 369, then results 370/369. This, as mathematics show,<br/>&gt; is the tempering for Bach&apos;s fifth.<br/>&gt; The most simple numbers pertaining to &quot;Werckmeister/Bach/wohltenmperirt&quot;<br/>&gt; are therefore are: 7, 5 the fifths, and 369, etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am sorry I still do not understand, why is the number 369 evident from page<br/>75 as the superparticular ratio for &quot;improving&quot; a harmony?  This mysterious<br/>harmony would then further mystify the players who were to be in tune with<br/>it.  Unless there is a reliable understanding, rather than a Soviet mystery,<br/>the intonation will always be suspect.</p><p>&gt; The 4 Duets, before my results impossible to explain, have ***369 *****<br/>&gt; bars; their midpoint being musically distinguished - look it up.<br/>&gt; That midpoint of the entire structure falls into Duetto II, its bar 112.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 369= 185+1+185</p><p>In the few music works you have analyzed by J.S. Bach, why did you pick these<br/>4 Duets?</p><p>As Duetto I has 73 bars, we have 73+112=185 for that central bar</p><p>&gt; of the overall structure.<br/>&gt; Gematria converts CHRISTUS, overall central bar into 112 - the &quot;mediator&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Duetto II itself,<br/>&gt; 149 bars, is structured 37+75+37 bars.<br/>&gt;                            7 perfect fifths+<br/>&gt;                             5 fifths &quot;&quot;wohltemperirt&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So we find symmetry in Bach measures, that&apos;s to be expected.  Can we<br/>interpret by numbers indifferent ways, in myriad ways?  Yes, that is done<br/>with statistics for political persons.  So what are rules of Gematria?  Where<br/>might it be referred to in Bach Documente?  And where they find the time to<br/>encrypt so efficiently?</p><p>&gt; The 75 central bars are structured 75=31+13+31 - tri-unitary. In baroque<br/>&gt; times the triad was a musico-theological symbol. In particular, by<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s musico-theological speculations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 37 framing bars are structured, again symmetrically, as 37=9+19+9:<br/>&gt; Therein, 9 is the trias trinitatis per additionem, 9=3+3+3, and<br/>&gt; 19 intervals, 12 fifths and 7 octaves in  the reversed sense, close<br/>&gt; the circle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I almost wonder if for a religious man like Werckmeister, he would be<br/>&quot;dishonest&quot; by encrypting a true tuning camouflaged by Spam.</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister invented &quot;Bach/wohltemperirt&quot;:<br/>&gt; **************************************************<br/>&gt;</p><p>You may mean &quot;Werckmeister lays hidden instructions for a composer he never<br/>met  to one-up his very own published tuning.&quot;  But I do know what you mean,<br/>that there is an agreement in the use of this mysteriously hidden insight.</p><p>&gt; This final application below of Gematria for baroque musicology<br/>&gt; proves beyond doubt that Werckmeister considered by no means<br/>&gt; the &quot;nominal system Werckmeister III&quot; as optimal!</p><p>Werckmeister claimed nothing as optimal.  He was open to many possibilities.<br/>Once you admit the Werckmeister III tuning, for which he was always suspected<br/>of having favored, is a treasure chest of many different European tunings<br/>(e.g. variants of different meantones, Pythagorean, modes), then there is no<br/>&quot;optimal.&quot;  It&apos;s the same realization Anaximander had when the Ionians put<br/>all numbers together as equals.  Discussions here of good and bad are out of<br/>place.</p><p>&gt; Could any person of esprit and competent in harpsichord<br/>&gt; tuning take seriously a system having within C-G-D-A-E three<br/>&gt; tempered and one perfect fifth?<br/>&gt; Could anybody explain to me what are the sufficient reasons<br/>&gt; NOT to equalize these four fifths??</p><p>This shows a bias to me, but not a true reasoning.  What is wrong with a pure<br/>A-E again?  I&apos;m not aware of any.  A major is rather unused among keys.  But<br/>redistributing the comma fraction might not be so bad at B-F#.  Might not<br/>their be a melodic advantage, in this music of simultaneous melodies.  Isn&apos;t<br/>&quot;temperatur&quot; a setting for pitches, but not necessarily more harmonic than<br/>melodic?</p><p>&gt; blabla that just serves to push &quot;Das XVIII. Capitel&quot; onto page 75! If no<br/>&gt; really substantial material is available, and you work under the FINALITY<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; attain with Cap. 28 the page 75 of 7 perfect and 5 well-tempered fifths,<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t you then necessarily to be verbose???<br/>&gt;</p><p>Wow, that was a surprise, I never thought you would think of Werckmeister IV,<br/>V, and VI as SPAM!<br/>And Werckmeister&apos;s verbosity was intended to be directed at his paranoia of<br/>future attacks, on his brown nosing, on his reputation for poor German,  on<br/>his lack of clarity, etc.</p><p>&gt; My lifetime is, like of anybody else, limited; and so, at best will and<br/>&gt; intentions, I cannot retype here my thoroughly elaborated text of :<br/>&gt;</p><p>Herbert Anton, you have most generous with your information and I do hope to<br/>read all I can on this subject.</p><p>&gt; Sometimes, in fact, I eat carotte-tarts.<br/>&gt;<br/>Now, you are making me hungry.  ; )</p><p>&gt; &gt; Still, there is only &quot;Werckmeister III&quot; for the full<br/>&gt; &gt; circle of keys in his Quedlinburg publication; the others are for a<br/>&gt; &gt; swatch of keys, not intended for full 12-note chromaticism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For not-full-12-note chromaticism, may I recommend mean-tone!!!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Which one and why?</p><p>&gt; Idem: Did Werckmeister already know the tuning of J.S. Bach for the &quot;48&quot;?<br/>&gt; English Harpsichord Magazine, Vol. 4, No. 1,1985, page 7-11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>The is an oxymoron in lieu of the dates, but I do think that Werckmeister<br/>picked up tuning specifics in Nordhausen, just south of his birth place, and<br/>which has a nice respect for books. It is where Werckmeister studied Latin.<br/>There he applied a CIRCUL of keys to his own music (as he was a composer),<br/>and to the music of others.  He was a well know player on keyboard, an organ<br/>diagnostician, theologian, and mathematician.  He married the daughter of the<br/>mayor of the city he was working in.</p><p>Werckmeister IV, V and VI is nothing more and else than SPAM. And<br/>&gt; even more surely, if compared to the qualities of W. III, filling up by<br/>&gt; Werckmeister IV, V and VI the pages unto 75.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you for being clear here.  Though, why did not Werckmeister not offer<br/>more prose Spam? Why NOT tell the truth, as we was sworn to as a Theologian?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Counting the letters at 11 and 11 for the title does not interest me much<br/>&gt; &gt; either, I&apos;m afraid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I respect your personal opinion - although this is not a very<br/>&gt; constructive one and, above all, - IMPO leads you to miss the essential<br/>&gt; point - assures to render yourself blindfolded!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Perhaps it will help to figure out how you assign numbers to letters.  Could<br/>you send this?</p><p>&gt; &gt; The final letter &quot;e&quot; of &quot;Musicalisch eTemperatur&quot; looks<br/>&gt; &gt; wrong as a code.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *This remark I do not understand at all. What could it possibly mean??<br/>&gt; *Where is there any  &quot;code&quot;; what, explicitly,  is wrong or looks wrong<br/>&gt; *here??**********************************************************<br/>&gt;</p><p>The title is only 11 and 11 if you count the last letter of the first word<br/>with the second word.  This looks wrong to my eye, especially as you have<br/>deduced an equality.  What is the code for each letter as to its number?   Or<br/>is it only the sum of the letters on a line, to be divided as best divined?</p><p>&gt; Under the hypothesis, Werckmeister intended to encode at an unique<br/>&gt; opportunity his preferred system (ref. my EHM-articles above on<br/>&gt; Werckmeister), I would waste my lifetime to check into titles of his<br/>&gt; other treatises. I suggest you do it yourself and report here your<br/>&gt; observations and any results that you deem significant.<br/>&gt; Or do you really expect he would have encoded a second time something as<br/>&gt; interesting as the system &quot;Werckmeister/Bach/wohltemperirt&quot;? Could it<br/>&gt; possibly be an everyday&apos; event to encode such features this subtle way<br/>&gt; into a title?<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, once would be enough.  If he encoded, it would always be referred back<br/>to.  But to superimpose Werckmeister&apos;s titles with a modern slant would<br/>surely show up at least a second one, and I don&apos;t think there is one.  I&apos;ve<br/>seen all his titles and they are most imaginative, usually.  He was a most<br/>practical man, admired for his mathematical abilities.  He came from a family<br/>of musicians and ministers of the Church.  Unless there is some hard evidence<br/>that he would entertain something as drawn out of his plates by you as<br/>SUPERIOR to what he invested his entire reputation on, still seems unlikely.<br/> I wonder, do you think that the fact there is no visual image of<br/>Werckmeister was intentional on his part?</p><p>&gt; You do certainly know &quot;QUAERENDO INVENIETIS&quot; and thus, are familiar with<br/>&gt; baroque mentality. Also, Kuhnau&apos;s riddle in Gematria, from the preface<br/>&gt; of his Biblische Historien Sonaten has now been common lore for some time.<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t it? Kuhnau utilizes, incidentally, the same gematria as Werckmeister<br/>&gt; or J. S. Bach.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, no, and no.  Anyone on List know these?  What I do know is that Kuhnau<br/>was friends with Werckmeister who lived not far away, and that J.S. Bach<br/>succeeded Kuhnau in Leipzig.</p><p>&gt; *The system &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; is the authentic one for &quot;Das wohltemperirte<br/>&gt; *Clavier&quot;. You claim, it is indistinguishable from Werckmeister III.<br/>&gt; *Don&apos;t you realize that you are in CONTRADICTION with yourself, when<br/>&gt; *you &quot;prefer&quot; Werckmeister III - didn&apos;t you just claim, they are<br/>&gt; &quot;INDISTINGUISHABLE&quot;?</p><p>You misunderstand me. &nbsp;Werckmeister III is superior from a contrapuntal point<br/>of view, but perhaps not from a harmonic point of view. &nbsp;From the melodic<br/>view, the stretched 504 cents is more pronounced than the various in your<br/>suggested tuning.</p><p>&gt; And, in view of the properties of Bach&apos;s title,<br/>&gt; &quot;Das wohltemperirte Clavier,&quot; seen together with its unexpected<br/>&gt; properties, parallel to Werckmeister&apos;s title - as a predecessor -<br/>&gt; &quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot;, it would be a vain effort to expect here any<br/>&gt; &quot;technological&quot; or specialized-jargon-experession.</p><p>Regarding the title, I would suggest Bach was in homage to Werckmeister<br/>because he used his predecessor&apos;s term.  The title, itself, is technical and<br/>specialized, actually.  And its usage makes manifest an historic recognition.<br/> IMHO</p><p>&gt; *It may take other 257 years for the general understanding and<br/>&gt; *acceptance that W. III wasn&apos;t taken seriously by Werckmeister himself.<br/>&gt; *As I describe in my publications, Werckmeister was an<br/>&gt; *amateur-mathematician in his leisure-time.<br/>&gt;<br/>I heard that he was a mathematician, and highly respected, when researching<br/>last year in Central Germany.  Many of his writings are mathematical in<br/>basis.  And this workaholic could hardly of had much leisure time,  certainly<br/>as much as you and I seem to have this fine August.</p><p>&gt; *Do not base yourself upon hearsay! Thereafter do then criticize<br/>&gt; *specifically any one of my writings in detail.<br/>&gt; It is, finally, amusing that Lenin said &quot;utchitcyia, utchitcyia,<br/>&gt; *utchitcyia&quot;, which means &quot;learning, learning, learning&quot;!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kind regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Herbert Anton Kellner<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m all ears.  Please, don&apos;t be so sure you have all the answers, either.  As<br/>a recorder player I will stay with WIII for the September 29th concert, but<br/>for a later excursion on a keyboard work tuned to Kellner I, it is most<br/>likely.</p><p>Kind regards, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
