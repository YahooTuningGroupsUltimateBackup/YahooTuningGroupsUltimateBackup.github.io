That<br/>he has used it for making faux-Mozart or whatever is a different<br/>issue, as is whether this is &quot;AI&quot; (which I believe he would say<br/>it is not).</p><p>I mentioned him in the context of JdLs tuning<br/>program in that his idea of &apos;signatures&apos;, which tend to give<br/>some of the &apos;musicality&apos; that the methods I mentioned lack, seems<br/>similar (in some way) to how JdLs program can discover an<br/>&apos;underlying tuning&apos; of a piece. [JdL : Another branch of computer<br/>music research that may be illuminating here are algorithmic<br/>methods of determining what key a piece is in and methods for<br/>determining the meter of a piece].</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
