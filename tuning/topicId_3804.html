Hence the<br/>&gt; &gt;ideal ratio y/x is 7.4.  Setting y=7 and x=1 gives 28-equal,<br/>&gt; and y=15, x=2<br/>&gt; &gt;gives 59-equal.<br/>&gt; &gt;  Sure enough, both have very good major thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s great! One _minor_ nit, (pun intended), according to<br/>&gt; Scala 2^7/5^3<br/>&gt; (41.1c) is called a minor diesis, and according to<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/Octave.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/Octave.html</a><br/>&gt; an enharmonic diesis is 525/512 = 3*5^2*7/2^9 (43.4c).</p><p>I know I&apos;ve seen the term &quot;enharmonic diesis&quot; used for different intervals.<br/>The one I stick with is what I saw first, but I gave the numbers to avoid<br/>ambiguity.</p><p>&gt; Can&apos;t find a name for the 5^7/2^16 (304.2c) minor third. It<br/>&gt; needs one. The<br/>&gt; &quot;double-diesis-flat third&quot;? &quot;Breed&apos;s minor third&quot;?</p><p>It is, in fact, a major third minus two of &quot;those&quot; dieses.  Calling it a<br/>minor third is consistent with one of &quot;those&quot; dieses being a half-sharp.</p><p>I was thinking about the general cases over the weekend.  You can work out<br/>an MOS approximation for any specific interval.  I&apos;ve got a spreadsheet that<br/>does the calculations, and intend to produce a Java applet sometime.<br/>Anyway, it should be obvious that a scale with major thirds can be<br/>represented by three intervals of a major third and a diesis to make up the<br/>octave.  I call that a 3+1 scale: 3 large intervals and 1 small.  Split the<br/>large interval into a smaller one plus the same diesis, and you get a 3+4<br/>scale.  Split it again, and you get 3+7.  Or again, to get 3+10: stop<br/>whenever you have enough notes.</p><p>So, major-third MOS&apos;s are of the pattern 3+1 -&gt; 3+4 -&gt; 3+7 -&gt; 3+10</p><p>I&apos;ve previously identified scales approximating the 11/9 neutral third as<br/>3+1 -&gt; 3+4 -&gt; 7+3 -&gt; 10+7</p><p>For minor thirds slightly exceeding an octave, an octave is still 3 large<br/>intervals and one small interval.  The next stage is 4 reduced minor thirds<br/>and 3 dieses, and so on.</p><p>So, minor third scales are 3+1 -&gt; 4+3 -&gt; 4+7 -&gt; 4+11 or somesuch.</p><p>[hmm.  The major-third scales as 3+7 are 7 &quot;dieses&quot; and 3 &quot;minor thirds&quot;.<br/>Make those real minor thirds, and you get 3+1, the start of this cascade.]</p><p>These third-based MOS&apos;s can be represented on something like Wilson&apos;s scale<br/>tree:</p><p>                3+1<br/>                / \<br/>               /   \<br/>              /     \<br/>            4+3     3+4<br/>            / \     / \<br/>          4+7 7+4 7+3 3+7</p><p>4+7 is minor thirds, 3+7 is major thirds, 7+3 is neutral thirds and 7+4 are<br/>neutral-ish thirds that may or may not double to give a fifth or approximate<br/>11/9.  Each scale can be assigned a &quot;representative&quot; EDI/ET/whatever:</p><p>                 7<br/>                / \<br/>               /   \<br/>              /     \<br/>             11     10<br/>            / \     / \<br/>          15   18 17   13</p><p>Why do this?  Because it shows the essential properties while making the<br/>diagram look simpler.  These trees are so interesting that I&apos;ll digress to<br/>explain why.  You can make them Pascal&apos;s triangle-type structures:</p><p>4              3<br/>        7<br/>   11      10<br/> 15  18  17  13</p><p>Each number is the sum of numbers immediately to the left and right in<br/>preceeding rows.  It differs from Pascal&apos;s triangle in that you can look<br/>more than one row back.  I think this has all been mentioned on the list<br/>before, but it can stand repeating.  Anyway, I call this diagram a web<br/>rather than a tree.</p><p>The web is bounded by 4 and 3, so a &quot;third&quot; could be anything between 1/4<br/>and 1/3 octaves.  The same web can be made to show the number of steps in<br/>the generating interval for the &quot;typical&quot; ET:</p><p>1               1<br/>        2<br/>    3       3<br/>  4   5   5   4</p><p>You can generate &quot;good&quot; ETs approximating a given interval by forming an<br/>equivalence interval from the &quot;ideal&quot; interval and a diesis, then finding<br/>the best matches to the ideal ratio.  Choosing each integer as the number of<br/>steps in the small interval, and calculating the large interval, gives the<br/>best approximations.  This misses a lot of scales however, so taking the<br/>large interval and calculating the small is how these lists were produced:</p><p>3/2: 2  5  7 10 12 14 17 19 22 24 27 29 31 34 36 39 41 43 46 48 51 43<br/>5/4: 3  6  9 12 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 47 50 53<br/>6/5: 4  8 11 15 19 23 27 30 34 38 42 46 49 53</p><p>By this method, the lowest EDIs with good representations of all 5-limit<br/>intervals are 12, 19, 34 and 53.  65 is the next.</p><p>&gt; So the corresponding intervals relating to fifths are 3^2/2^3<br/>&gt; (203.9c) the<br/>&gt; major whole tone (or Pythagorean whole tone), and 2^8/3^5 (90.2c) the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean semitone (or Pythagorean limma). The ideal t/s ratio is<br/>&gt; therefore 2.26 and thus we have 53-tET with excellent fifths<br/>&gt; where t = 9 and s = 4.</p><p>For Pythagorean scales, you&apos;d start with 2+1 for fourths and tones.  The<br/>tree is:</p><p>                      2+1<br/>                     /   \<br/>                    /     \<br/>                   /       \<br/>                  /         \<br/>                 /           \<br/>                /             \<br/>              3+2             2+3<br/>              / \             / \<br/>             /   \           /   \<br/>            /     \         /     \<br/>          3+5     5+3     5+2     2+5<br/>          / \     / \     / \     / \<br/>        3+8 8+3 8+5 5+8 5+7 7+5 7+2  2+7</p><p>The 5+2 branch is the one with semitones and limmas.  5+7 is schismic and<br/>7+5 meantone scales.  The web is:</p><p>3                              2<br/>                5<br/>        8               7<br/>   11      13      12       9<br/> 14  19  21  18  17  19  16  11</p><p>And the &quot;diatonic&quot; bit:</p><p>5                                 7<br/>                 12<br/>         17              19<br/>     22      29      31      26<br/>  27   39  46  41  43  50  45  33</p><p>So, where am I getting with all this?  I don&apos;t know, I&apos;ll try and get a web<br/>page done sometime.  However, the top web is for a &quot;fourth&quot; between 1/3 and<br/>1/2 octaves, and the lower web for a more realistic fourth-like fourth<br/>between 1/7 and 1/5 octaves.  The number of steps in that fourth being, for<br/>the diatonic bit:</p><p>2                                 3<br/>                  5<br/>          7               8<br/>      9      12      13      11<br/>  11   16  19  17  18  21  19  14</p><p>Fourths and thirds can also be united by a super-web:</p><p>1                 2<br/>         3<br/>    4         5</p><p>or</p><p>0+1                 1+0<br/>          1+1<br/>     1+2       2+1</p><p>Any MOS will be on this web somewhere!</p><p>&gt; I find it interesting that the diatonic scale falls out of<br/>&gt; this formula for<br/>&gt; ET&apos;s (EDO&apos;s) with reasonable fifths, N = 5T + 2s where T &gt;= 0<br/>&gt; and T/9 &lt;= s &lt;= 6T/7.</p><p>Er, hang on, where do these numbers come from?</p><p>&gt; This suggests the question of whether the analogous thing for<br/>&gt; major thirds<br/>&gt; might be of interest. i.e. &quot;that scale having the maximum<br/>&gt; notes, with two<br/>&gt; different step sizes arranged maximally evenly, which can be<br/>&gt; constructed in<br/>&gt; every equal division of the octave that has reasonable major thirds&quot;.</p><p>I think this kind of thing is very interesting.  It lets us use two-interval<br/>scales without falling into &quot;chronic 3-ism&quot;.  As I said on the list a while<br/>back, I&apos;ve been looking at 3+4 scales: where 3 large intervals and 4 small<br/>make up an octave.  If the large interval is much larger, major thirds come<br/>out and the fifths aren&apos;t so good.  I don&apos;t think these scales would work<br/>melodically as d is so much smaller than T for good major thirds.</p></div>
