People<br/>tell me in jazz one often leaves out the fifth of a chord, and 37<br/>rather encourages doing that. I usually think of it in connection with<br/>porcupine, but 3125/3087, not a porcupine comma, is 3-free and pretty<br/>important to the no-threes harmony of 37.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2007 10:31:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I usually think of it in connection with<br/>&gt; porcupine, but 3125/3087, not a porcupine comma, is 3-free and pretty<br/>&gt; important to the no-threes harmony of 37.</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;m babbling. That&apos;s a no-twos comma of course, as one can tell<br/>just by looking at it and seeing it is a ratio of two odd numbers.<br/>However, everything I said is actually true of 3136/3125 instead.</p><p>We have that 3136/3125 is |6 -5 2&gt; in no-threes monzo form, with a<br/>complement of &lt;2 5 6|. The corresponding temperament is therefore the<br/>no-threes version of hemiwuer, with 6/37 as a generator. Hemiwuer is in<br/>fact a 37-temperament, and is interesting in 37 since 3 is so complex<br/>in hemiwuer anyway. MOS of size 7 or 13 are interesting scale<br/>possibilities.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2007 11:31:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I can think of ones I like better, but both 37 and 38 (and for that<br/>&gt; matter 36, which you missed) have interesting possibilities.
