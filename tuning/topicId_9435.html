What distinguishes the<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt; from the Chromatic for them?  It may be that the word &quot;diatonic&quot; takes on<br/>a<br/>&gt; different meaning for the Middle Ages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard<br/>&gt;</p><p>The standard reference is Chalmers, _The Divisions of the Tetrachord_ (Frog<br/>Peak).  Chalmer&apos;s catalog uses a characteristic interval size of 250 cents<br/>to distinguish chromatic from diatonic tetrachords.  Classical theory did<br/>not define a borderline between the genera in these terms, but it is clear<br/>that a diatonic tetrachord was composed of two tones and a semitone and that<br/>the principal sizes of tones used were 8/7, 9/8, and 10/9.  The medieval<br/>European reduction to one tetrachordal genus, the diatonic, in one tuning,<br/>the ditone (Pythagorean) must have occurred through a confluence of factors:<br/>encounters with musics outside of the Hellenistic traditions, Platonism,<br/>trinitarianism etc.. On the other hand, in the Islamicate world, intervallic<br/>variety remained relatively unimpoverished: although the enharmonic was<br/>apparently lost forever, the development of new techniques for rotating and<br/>permutating tetrachords contributed, in part, to the enduring presence of<br/>these tunings.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=9451 href="#9451">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Nicola<br/>&gt;Vicentino wrote of the difference between the Renaissance and the<br/>post-Roman<br/>&gt;(Boethius) versions.  Vicentino wrote in 1555:</p><p>&gt;Vicentino wrote in 1555:</p><p>&gt;&quot;The difference between our practice and the one discussed by Boethius is<br/>&gt;this: Ancient musicians used the genera individually in their practice and<br/>&gt;consequently the minor semitone with two sesquioctaval whole tones were<br/>&gt;satisfactory for the genera.  But in our times, both the sound of practical</p><p>&gt;music and the tuning of instruments are unlike those of ancient musicians,<br/>&gt;for we use the genera and the species together and with more consonances<br/>than<br/>&gt;they had--namely, thirds and sixths.  To be able to have more consonances<br/>as<br/>&gt;well as to make many steps, we do not find it inconvenient to blunt a fifth</p><p>&gt;and enlarge a fourth, as I said.  This blunting, as you will learn in the<br/>&gt;proper place (book V, chapter 5), does not shock the sense of hearing<br/>because<br/>&gt;the quantity removed is so tiny in itself and because these particles are<br/>&gt;distributed here and there wherever they are needed.  Practitioners of this</p><p>&gt;tuning describe such fifths and fourths as tempered.&quot;  (Vicentino, p. 45 of</p><p>&gt;Maria Rika Maniates translation)</p><p>Vicentino here proves to be my hero once again by stating, as I often do,<br/>that the optimal fixed tuning for the diatonic scale with respect to 3-limit<br/>harmony is Pythagorean tuning, while the optimal fixed tuning for the<br/>diatonic scale with respect to 5-limit harmony is a meantone tuning.</p><p>&gt;As sensible as the above seems to me, the translator wrote in a coupled<br/>&gt;footnote:</p><p>&gt;Footnote #48: &quot;The gist of this paragraph suggests that Vicentino here, as<br/>&gt;elsewhere, put together an inaccurate and rather haphazard conflation of<br/>&gt;propositions and opinions culled from the &quot;Musica theorica&quot; by Fogliano, an</p><p>&gt;organist and choirmaster who served the Este family in Modena.  Fogliano&apos;s<br/>&gt;text, then, may explain the anomalies in Vicentino&apos;s arguments.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Does this dark shadow on her subject make sense to anyone?</p><p>Perhaps the translator was taking issue with the description of &quot;ancient&quot;<br/>(pre-medieval?) practice? Otherwise, I might surmise that the translator<br/>simply failed to understand Vicentino&apos;s reasoning -- how does the translator<br/>react to the section in question (book V, chapter 5)?</p></div>
