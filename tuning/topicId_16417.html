Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2000 1:47:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I would like to thank both Paul Erlich and<br/>Joe Monzo for their responses to my &quot;summing up&quot; remarks on the<br/>question of defining just intonation (JI).</p><p>On one level, Paul and Monz, I would like to respond in turn by saying<br/>that we seem in agreement on some important points, and that this<br/>agreement might have been clearer had I written in a more coherent<br/>manner. A main purpose of this post, indeed, is to affirm what appear<br/>to be our points of common understanding, and also to clarify some of<br/>my motives for focusing on the side of my musicmaking which may be<br/>most marginal or &quot;problematic&quot; from the standpoint of this JI debate.</p><p>At the same time, I feel impelled by your responses to recognize that<br/>when I was writing that &quot;summing up&quot; statement I was feeling some real<br/>conflict, and that while not necessarily communicating my ideas that<br/>clearly, I may have let some of my actual ambivalence show.<br/>Recognizing this, with your help, has led me to what I find a<br/>comfortable position on these definitional issues, joyfully affirming<br/>that different people can and will take different positions depending<br/>on their musical and philosophical points of view.</p><p>First of all, both Paul and Monz, we very strongly agree that<br/>integer-based music where only prime factors of 2 or 3 are basic or<br/>constraining elements is radically different in many ways from music<br/>where such incommensurable primes as 3 and 5, or 5 and 7, are a<br/>constraining part of the musical equation.</p><p>An interesting essay might be written on this distinction and its<br/>implications, both historical and practical.</p><p>So far in this thread, I have focused mainly on Gothic/neo-Gothic<br/>music not only because it is where my musical and theoretical passion<br/>is at (along with Renaissance/Manneristic music), but because it may<br/>be a marginal or problematic case from many &quot;JI&quot; viewpoints, and thus<br/>possibly of special interest in a definitional discussion.</p><p>However, to illustrate the very important point which both of you<br/>made, I need only draw on a bit of practical experience.</p><p>Suppose I play a basic kind of 16th-century piece for four voices,<br/>whether closer to 1500 (e.g. a Spanish villancico) or 1600 (say a<br/>brief motet by Lasso). In meantone, my keyboard technique will<br/>generally be quite distinct from that required in Zarlino&apos;s JI tuning<br/>(a 15-note version mapped to two keyboards). The problems of combining<br/>prime factors of 3 and 5 -- keeping them both Just on a sustained<br/>basis -- rapidly become clear.</p><p>In contrast, suppose that in a neo-Gothic setting I play a medieval<br/>piece or an improvisation first in Pythagorean (a completely<br/>integer-based tuning), then in 29-tone equal temperament (29-tET). My<br/>technique is likely to be much the same, albeit with subtle shifts in<br/>the flavor of some intervals, maybe comparable to shifting from<br/>1/4-comma to 2/7-comma or 1/6-comma meantone for 16th-century music.</p><p>This is a difference not only of mathematics or of aural experience --<br/>it is one felt with the hands, the ways they navigate an intonational<br/>geometry.</p><p>Another difference which our dialogue may have brought out is that in<br/>neo-Gothic rational intonations, where 2:3:4 represents a full stable<br/>concord, the intonation of most other intervals leaves immense room<br/>for freedom. In a system based on the pure and stable 4:5:6 or<br/>something yet more complex, there are, to borrow Donald Hall&apos;s<br/>language, much sparser &quot;degrees of freedom.&quot;</p><p>Your remarks, Paul and Monz, and also Dave Keenan&apos;s focus on locked-in<br/>partials, illustrate a related point: typical &quot;JI&quot; is much more bound<br/>up with the harmonic series (in usual timbres, at least) than<br/>integer-based Gothic/neo-Gothic.</p><p>Having relished Dave&apos;s humor about designing playing the Hammond organ<br/>with the _intent_ to have its integer ratios construed as JI, I might<br/>point to a more obscure kind of humorous gloss on one of my &quot;summing<br/>up&quot; remarks.</p><p>When referring to &quot;modern&quot; ratios such as &quot;28:33:42&quot; or &quot;14:17:21,&quot; I<br/>was doing so with a certain wry awareness of using them as<br/>neo-medieval variants on a usual 54:64:81, with equally little<br/>reference to partials in any of these three instances. As Dan Stearns<br/>once suggested by invoking a stirring Latin motto, this is the freedom<br/>of the plateau.</p><p>In short, there is an excellent case to be made -- and both of you<br/>have made it -- that a just tuning system constrained by maintaining<br/>pure ratios involving multiple primes, and largely determined by the<br/>harmonic series or relations between partials, might well be placed in<br/>a different category than an integer-based tuning where only such<br/>ratios as 2:3:4 are constraining or &quot;harmonicity-based&quot; elements.</p><p>Dave, you have offered a very nice example of this intuitive<br/>conversational distinction in your paper on single chain of fifths<br/>tunings, one well worth quoting, where you distinguish this category<br/>of tunings from others:</p><p>            &quot;Just tunings are not in this class because their<br/>             intervals (other than fifths) are not generated<br/>             or approximated by chains of fifths at all.&quot;</p><p>While you have recently proposed a definition of JI which can include<br/>Pythagorean, I might take this quote not as a position entailing its<br/>exclusion, but as a conversational shorthand for &quot;Just tunings (other<br/>than Pythagorean, not the most typical case, which obviously _is_ a<br/>chain-of-fifths tuning).&quot;</p><p>As we have briefly discussed, Monz, there may be an historical reason<br/>for this: &quot;JI&quot; in its typically paradigmatic sense of &quot;5-limit&quot;<br/>emerges in Continental European theory around the later 15th century<br/>(e.g. Ramos 1582), and more definitively in Fogliano (1529) and<br/>Zarlino (1558), as a deliberate departure from Pythagorean intonation.</p><p>Modern discussions of vocal intonation, for example, follow this usage<br/>when they speak of &quot;Pythagorean&quot; and &quot;Just&quot; as two contrasting<br/>categories or tendencies, rather than the first as a subset of the<br/>second, which carries the obvious implication &quot;5-limit Just.&quot;</p><p>Also, Paul, in your comments about &quot;out-of-tuneness,&quot; you remark on<br/>the at least arguable tension between the vertical and melodic<br/>dimensions in JI. In Pythagorean or some related Gothic/neo-Gothic<br/>system, the two dimensions generally seem in equilibrium; Carl<br/>Dahlhaus has in fact argued that the breaking of this symmetry is one<br/>feature of the transition from medieval to Renaissance and later<br/>technique.</p><p>In my first &quot;summing up&quot; post, my intended theoretical message was<br/>something like this: &quot;The fact that many typical &apos;JI&apos; concepts feel<br/>uncomfortable to me in a Gothic/neo-Gothic context suggests that maybe<br/>this music is different from that of a usual JI setting, and might fit<br/>better under a distinct paradigm such as &apos;rational intonation&apos; (RI).&quot;</p><p>Now I may be able more coherently, I hope, to list some of the<br/>possible differences:</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Typical JI (5-limit or higher)     Gothic/neo-Gothic RI<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Complex real-time keyboarding      Often simple keyboarding<br/>Nonregular tunings                 Often regular/quasi-regular tunings<br/>Ratios suggest partials (5:6)      Ratios often &quot;nonharmonic&quot; (32:27)<br/>Incommensurate multiple primes     Only 2 and 3 essentially constrain<br/>Sparse degrees of freedom (Hall)   Most intervals quite free (flavors)<br/>Entropic valleys pervasive         Most intervals unstable, on plateaux<br/>Ideal of beatlessness              Ideal of diversity and contrast<br/>Preference for small integers      Love of large nuanced integers<br/>Vertical/melodic tradeoffs         Equilibrium between dimensions<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Of course, these intonational contrasts typically correlate with very<br/>tangible differences in musical style: compare 13th-century<br/>compositions of Continental Western Europe fitting a Pythagorean<br/>tuning with vocal compositions of the 16th century suggesting an ideal<br/>of 5-limit JI (very possibly adaptive in practice).</p><p>A question this kind of approach -- which I give you both credit for,<br/>Paul and Monz, while assuming full responsibility for my gloss here<br/>with whatever imperfections it may have -- raises, is whether both<br/>approaches felicitously can fit under the single tent of &quot;JI.&quot;</p><p>What they share in common is a basis in integer ratios; but those<br/>ratios may actually mean or imply different things: in one case<br/>partials, in the other case simply whatever numbers or nuances of<br/>positioning on a plateau happen to strike the musician&apos;s fancy at<br/>given time or for a given piece.</p><p>Similarly, a neo-Gothic use of 29-tET, a Renaissance-like use of<br/>31-tET, and an avant garde serialist use of 11-tET all might fit in<br/>the category of &quot;equal temperament&quot; -- but just how unified is this<br/>category in terms of style or practice?</p><p>Given the diversity of musical cultures, styles, and tuning systems,<br/>people will draw lines and associate patterns in different ways. The<br/>problem of defining &quot;JI&quot; is only one illustration.</p><p>My own rather serene conclusion is that in discourse settings where<br/>people tend to associate &quot;JI&quot; with integer ratios, I would describe<br/>Gothic/neo-Gothic RI and Renaissance 5-limit music as subsets of JI.</p><p>In discourse settings where people tend to associate &quot;JI&quot; with 5-limit<br/>or higher systems, or with a predominantly harmonicity-based outlook,<br/>I would stick with the term &quot;RI&quot; (or something more specific, as the<br/>context may invite, e.g. &quot;Pythagorean&quot;) for Gothic/neo-Gothic music,<br/>while reserving &quot;JI&quot; for Renaissance or other contexts where it may<br/>have its expected meaning.</p><p>The connection has been drawn between the multiple dictionary entries<br/>for common English words such as &quot;run,&quot; and the multiple definitions<br/>of intonational terms. I find this multiplicity natural in both<br/>cases.</p><p>To borrow another comparison involving natural languages, I might<br/>suggest that just as the tense-aspect systems of different languages<br/>may draw different lines between categories of time and the temporal<br/>structure of situations, so different people may draw such lines in<br/>grouping integer-based tunings together, or tunings with pervasive<br/>locking-in partials, etc.</p><p>It is fascinating to explore the margins or outlying areas of a<br/>concept through a dialogue like this: adaptive tunings where vertical<br/>intervals remain pure (or in some systems close to pure) based on<br/>tempered melodic steps; non-integer-based tunings with Setharean<br/>equivalents of &quot;locking-in partials&quot;; systems based in large part or<br/>even in whole on complex integer ratios; and so on.</p><p>Writing around 1100, the theorist known as John of Afflighem or John<br/>Cotton opened a discussion on polyphony by saying that different<br/>people treat it in different ways, but he would share his own approach<br/>based in good part on the concept of contrary motion.</p><p>Nine centuries later, I hope that this thread has shown the virtues of<br/>the same pluralistic approach, with much room for recognition of<br/>commonalities and creative differences alike.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16422 href="#16422">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2000 11:45:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
