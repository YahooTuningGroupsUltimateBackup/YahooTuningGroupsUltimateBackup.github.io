Circles and orbits<br/>---------------------</p><p>The first guideline I might offer is that all circulating tunings and<br/>temperaments, or &quot;circles,&quot; are also &quot;orbits&quot; -- but the latter<br/>category also includes some schemes with some &quot;circle-like&quot; qualities<br/>which nevertheless are a bit too &quot;eccentric&quot; (an astronomical<br/>metaphor) to meet the usual requirements for a &quot;well-temperament&quot; or<br/>the like.</p><p>Let&apos;s consider some types of systems qualifying as &quot;circles,&quot; or<br/>&quot;circulating&quot; schemes as they are often called:</p><p>             1. Equal temperaments are precisely symmetrical<br/>                closed circles in the mathematical as well as<br/>                musical sense;</p><p>             2. Unequal well-temperaments use generators of<br/>                different sizes (e.g. the fifths of a 12-note<br/>                or 17-note well-temperament), but within<br/>                certain constraints so as to produce &quot;playable<br/>                concords&quot; or the equivalent at all positions.</p><p>             3. Loops use a single regular generator (aside<br/>                from an octave or other interval of repetition),<br/>                and produce a scheme with a slight asymmetry,<br/>                but with the requirements met for a &quot;circle&quot;<br/>                (playable concords in all positions).</p><p>Examples of the &quot;loop&quot; type of circle are a 53-note Pythagorean system<br/>(with the odd 53rd fifth about 3.62 cents narrow); or 1/4-comma<br/>meantone (with the odd 31st fifth about 0.69 cents wide).</p><p>In the latter example, by the way, we have a kind of &quot;anti-Wolf fifth&quot;<br/>notably _closer_ to 3:2 than the others (narrow by around 5.38 cents).</p><p>All of these &quot;circles&quot; are types of the larger category of &quot;orbit,&quot;<br/>which includes all of these circulating schemes plus others which have<br/>some &quot;near-circular&quot; properties but might, for example, have &quot;Wolf&quot;<br/>fifths or fourths in one or more positions.</p><p>Thus either 17-EDO or George Secor&apos;s 17-note well-temperament is a<br/>kind of &quot;17-note circle,&quot; a category which in turn falls within the<br/>broader set of &quot;17-note orbits.&quot;</p><p>However, the latter category of orbits also includes, for example,<br/>schemes where all 17 steps are &quot;minor semitones&quot; or &quot;thirdtones&quot;<br/>within 15 cents or so of 17-tET (~70.588 cents), and intervals such as<br/>thirds and sixths keep within a range from around Pythagorean to<br/>septimal (e.g. major thirds from 81:64 or ~407.82 cents to around 9:7<br/>or ~435.08 cents or a bit larger), but some fifths could be wide by as<br/>much as a full 64:63 or Archytan comma (~27.26 cents), as George Secor<br/>well calls it.</p><p>In such a scheme one can use every step as a diatonic semitone, and<br/>rely on 17-note circle-like equivalences such as A#=Cb and Gb=E#, but<br/>in usual harmonic timbres would find certain fifths quite unlikely<br/>landing places for cadential progressions to stability.</p><p>In contrast, in a 17-note circle such as 17-EDO or George Secor&apos;s<br/>unequal well-temperament, one _can_ comfortably land on a fifth at any<br/>position in the circle.</p><p>Here two points may be helpful: the line between a &quot;circle&quot; and some<br/>more eccentric type of &quot;orbit&quot; can be a matter of fine judgment and<br/>sometimes differing tastes; and while the &quot;orbit&quot; category includes<br/>both &quot;circles&quot; and some more eccentric schemes, it has also has<br/>certain expectations (however loose or vaguely defined). In other<br/>words, not every tuning scheme with n notes is an n-note &quot;orbit.&quot;</p><p>One fine point of defining a &quot;circle&quot; is that the requirement of<br/>&quot;acceptable concords in all positions&quot; can depend both on the types of<br/>sonorities regarded as &quot;stable concords&quot; (and especially saturated<br/>ones, e.g. medieval European trines at 2:3:4, or Renaissance-Romantic<br/>triads at 4:5:6), and one how far one permits such &quot;concords&quot; to vary<br/>from pure and yet be deemed &quot;playable.&quot;</p><p>For example, some people might regard Kirnberger II&apos;s fifths at 1/2<br/>syntonic comma narrower than pure (~10.75 cents) as closer to outright<br/>Wolves than to &quot;comfortably playable,&quot; although they come within the<br/>sometimes quoted limit of 1/2 Pythagorean comma (~11.73 cents), or<br/>Dave Keenan&apos;s ingenious definition of a &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; as one which,<br/>when placed in a chain of 11 or less, can generate an interval closer<br/>to 3:2.</p><p>In a French _temperament ordinaire_ of the 17th-18th centuries, all<br/>fifths are comfortably close to 3:2, but by Baroque-Classic standards,<br/>the widest major thirds at somewhat larger than Pythagorean might go<br/>beyond the limits of &quot;playability&quot; as stable concords. Thus the status<br/>of this type of scheme as a &quot;well-temperament&quot; -- by 18th-century<br/>standards -- is sometimes debated.</p><p>The broader &quot;orbit&quot; category includes not only typical or more<br/>marginal circles, but also tunings with some &quot;Wolf fifths&quot; or the<br/>like; nevertheless, even this category excludes lots of tunings.</p><p>For example, we would not describe a 17-note Pythagorean tuning as a<br/>&quot;17-note orbit,&quot; since some adjacent steps are limmas or diatonic<br/>semitones at 256:243 (~90.22 cents) while others are Pythagorean<br/>commas at 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents) -- roughly 4/9-tone and<br/>1/9-tone. Such an arrangement is clearly distinguishable from a<br/>&quot;quasi-circle&quot; of 17 &quot;thirdtones&quot; or the like, however liberally<br/>defined (say all steps at least 50-55 cents).</p><p>In short, orbits include all the more or less usual &quot;circles&quot; or<br/>&quot;circulating&quot; schemes, plus some more eccentric schemes with<br/>&quot;quasi-circular properties.&quot;</p><p>How an &quot;orbit&quot; of the more eccentric type is likely to differ from a<br/>&quot;circle&quot; may depend on the stylistic constraints.</p><p>Thus in a neo-Gothic system, for example a 17-note orbit, Wolf fifths<br/>are the likeliest factor. This is true both because fifths and fourths<br/>are the primary concords, and because relatively concordant intervals<br/>such as thirds and sixths have a much wider range of &quot;interchangeably<br/>playable&quot; variations in this type of style. Thus I would happily<br/>accept anything in the range of 408-440 cents as a &quot;usual neo-Gothic<br/>major third,&quot; but would expect &quot;interchangeable&quot; fifths to remain<br/>within about 8-9 cents of pure (and preferably closer).</p><p>Note that &quot;noninterchangeable&quot; intervals such as fifths at 32:21<br/>(~729.22 cents, a 64:63 wider than 3:2) can be a special attraction of<br/>these &quot;eccentric orbits,&quot; and are precisely what is excluded by the<br/>usual criteria of &quot;circularity&quot; or &quot;well-temperament.&quot;</p><p>With an 18th-century type of 12-note system, either Wolf fifths or<br/>major thirds deemed to be &quot;noninterchangeable&quot; (i.e. substantially<br/>larger than Pythagorean) might make a system an &quot;orbit&quot; of the type<br/>other than a &quot;circle.&quot; These intervals, also, are available for<br/>special effects.</p><p>------------------------<br/>2. A Gricean implicature<br/>------------------------</p><p>Strictly speaking, any &quot;circular&quot; system (equal temperament, unequal<br/>well-temperament/tuning, or loop) is also a type of orbit.</p><p>However, if one describes a new or unfamiliar system as &quot;a 22-note<br/>orbit,&quot; for example, this may invite the listener or reader to draw an<br/>inference that the system is an orbit of the more &quot;eccentric&quot; type<br/>rather than an equal or unequal &quot;circle.&quot;</p><p>The reason for this is what Paul Grice has described as the<br/>&quot;Cooperative Principle&quot; in conversation: to give the most informative<br/>description as economically as possible.</p><p>Thus it would be usual to describe either 22-EDO or Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>unequal 22-note well-temperament as a &quot;22-note circle,&quot; which conveys<br/>both that it is necessarily also an &quot;orbit,&quot; and also that it<br/>circulates by usual standards.</p><p>If one says that a given tuning system is an &quot;orbit,&quot; but _not_ that<br/>it is a circle (a more specific and thus informative description),<br/>then one might draw a &quot;conversational implicature&quot; that the system is<br/>an orbit other than a circle.</p><p>Similarly, the following types of &quot;Gricean implicatures&quot; are typical<br/>of everyday conversation:</p><p>                 * &quot;Last night I saw you at the party with someone<br/>                   (presumably not a mutually known family member,<br/>                    friend, or acquaintance).</p><p>                 * &quot;We were somewhere in New York State&quot; (likely<br/>                   somewhere other than Times Square or another<br/>                   especially familiar place).</p><p>Thus if a system is deemed to &quot;circulate&quot; by usual standards for a<br/>given style or genre, we tend to communicate this information by<br/>speaking of a &quot;circle&quot; or the like; to describe a system more<br/>generally as an &quot;orbit&quot; can implicate that it is not within the<br/>narrower and more specific category.</p><p>Of course, it can be useful to consider circles as a subset of orbits:<br/>for example, &quot;17-note orbits, conventionally circulating or<br/>otherwise.&quot;</p><p>Again, the &quot;orbit&quot; may be a rather new concept in tuning systems; like<br/>an astronomical orbit, it can vary greatly in the degree of<br/>&quot;eccentricity.&quot;</p><p>While all circles are also orbits, it is especially the<br/>&quot;quasi-circular&quot; systems outside the usual standards for a circulating<br/>system that promoted this broader category.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=36136 href="#36136">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2002 12:09:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
