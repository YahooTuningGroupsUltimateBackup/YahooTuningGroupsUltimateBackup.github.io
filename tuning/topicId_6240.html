Often the term is associated with assumptions which apply<br/>to specific styles of music, and may not apply to JI systems<br/>appropriate to other eras or styles or world musical traditions.</p><p>Here I would like to suggest a definition of JI which takes into<br/>account not only the objective qualities of a tuning system, but also<br/>the qualities of the music for which its &quot;justness&quot; is being judged.<br/>In other words, the same tuning may be an instance of &quot;JI&quot; when<br/>applied to one piece of music, but not an instance of &quot;JI&quot; when<br/>applied to another.</p><p>Too often, it is tempting to define a JI system as &quot;a system that does<br/>intonational justice to my favorite music, or at least a significant<br/>subset of it.&quot; Rather than simply repudiate this human proclivity, I<br/>would like here to bring it into good service: to define &quot;JI&quot; as a<br/>meeting between a tuning system with certain characteristics and a<br/>style of music to which the tuning system can &quot;do justice.&quot;</p><p>It is my pleasure warmly to dedicate this article to Johnny Reinhard,<br/>whose views on intonational issues in the works of Charles Ives<br/>(1874-1954) have led me to the conclusion that what is JI for Perotin<br/>may be a deliberate and artful departure from JI for Ives. Possibly<br/>one might speak of an outlook of &quot;intonational relativity,&quot; where the<br/>justness of a tuning depends on the music&apos;s frame of reference. In any<br/>case, while the flaws of this article are of course my own responsi-<br/>bility, I would like to thank Johnny Reinhard for his thoughtful<br/>contributions to this list and his bold enthusiasm for many kinds of<br/>music.</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>1. What is Classic JI?: A threefold definition<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>In defining a JI system, I would like to focus on three requirements,<br/>two being reasonably objective and intrinsic to the tuning system<br/>itself, the third being contextual, and depending upon the specific<br/>musical composition or style to which the system might be applied.</p><p>After giving the following formal definition, I would like to explain<br/>each of the three points of the definition in a more informal and<br/>conversational manner:</p><p>             A tuning system is a classic just intonation system<br/>             in the context of a specific musical composition or<br/>             style if:</p><p>             (1) All intervals in the system are defined as<br/>                 integer ratios;</p><p>             (2) The system provides a complete set of<br/>                 low-integer ratios up to an odd factor or<br/>                 &quot;odd-limit&quot; of at least 3; and</p><p>             (3) This odd-limit is high enough to provide<br/>                 pure or low-integer ratios for all stable<br/>                 concords in the given musical context.</p><p>To anticipate a curious question for some readers and an ardent cause<br/>for others, I would explain for the moment that in addition to what I<br/>term &quot;classic JI&quot; systems meeting all three requirements, there are<br/>&quot;adaptive JI&quot; systems.[1] The latter systems meet points (2) and (3),<br/>but typically include some intervals based on irrational rather than<br/>integer ratios (see Section 3).</p><p>Returning to more conventional or &quot;classic&quot; JI, let&apos;s consider each of<br/>the three points.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.1. Classic JI systems define all intervals as integer ratios<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Our first requirement simply says that JI systems, as opposed to other<br/>systems, derive all their intervals from integer ratios. In other<br/>words, JI systems and tempered systems with at least some irrational<br/>ratios are here treated as mutually exclusive categories. This test<br/>tells us that neither 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet) nor 1/4-comma<br/>meantone (despite its pure 5:4 major thirds) is a JI system, because<br/>both include irrational ratios.[2]</p><p>Within this constraint of &quot;all intervals as integer ratios,&quot; a JI<br/>system may be built in various ways. One elegant method is simply to<br/>build from the powers of 3:2 (the pure fifth) or 4:3 (the pure<br/>fourth), plus 2:1 (the pure octave). Thus we obtain a pure major<br/>second (9:8) from two pure fifths minus an octave, and an intriguing<br/>major sixth (27:16) and major third (81:64) from three or four pure<br/>fifths respectively, and so on. Since 3 is the highest prime factor in<br/>this system, it is called a &quot;3-prime-limit&quot; JI system.</p><p>A &quot;5-prime-limit&quot; system would add intervals such as pure major thirds<br/>(5:4) and minor thirds (6:5), and also, for example, a minor seventh<br/>at 9:5. Such a system could also have what might be less obvious<br/>intervals, for example a variety of minor second at 135:128, as the<br/>prime factors 2, 3 and 5 interact in various ways.</p><p>A &quot;7-prime-limit&quot; system would add yet more intervals, both obvious<br/>favorites for advocates of this system such as the 7:4 minor seventh,<br/>and more intricate ones such as the neutral third (between minor and<br/>major) of 49:40. Here the prime factors 2, 3, 5, and 7 are free to<br/>interact.</p><p>Current JI systems may have prime limits as high as 17 or 19; beyond<br/>this point, there is some debate as to whether yet higher primes<br/>really have a tangible musical identity.</p><p>While this first requirement is significant in what it excludes<br/>(temperament in its various forms), it is also significant in what it<br/>permits. Both the variety of JI systems, from 3-limit to 19-limit or<br/>higher, and the variety of musics based on these systems, are awesome.</p><p>Sometimes people speak categorically of a &quot;just scale&quot; or &quot;just<br/>intonational ideal.&quot; In such cases, one must ask, &quot;Which one?&quot; As<br/>Admiral Grace Hopper remarked of software standards, we might remark<br/>of JI standards: the nice thing about them is that there are so many<br/>to choose from.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.2. Classic JI systems provide pure concords to at least 3-odd-limit<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Our second requirement focuses on the expectation that a JI system<br/>will provide ideally pure or simple ratios for the stable concords in<br/>a given music. This ideal is sometimes described as &quot;beatlessness.&quot;</p><p>For example, in a style of music using fifths and fourths as the<br/>richest stable concords, ratios for these intervals of 3:2 and 4:3<br/>respectively should make them sound ideally smooth and blending.</p><p>In another style favoring stable sonorities built from not only these<br/>intervals but also major and minor thirds, tuning these thirds at 5:4<br/>and 6:5 should likewise produce an ideally smooth and blending<br/>quality.</p><p>Still another style might prefer richly stable sonorities of 4:5:6:7,<br/>6:7:9, or 12:14:18:21, and here the availability of pure or simple<br/>integer ratios such as 7:4, 7:6, and 9:7 should again optimize the<br/>blend or concord.</p><p>In order that a JI system may fulfill such expectations, it must<br/>provide a complete set of intervals with low-integer ratios up to an<br/>&quot;odd-limit&quot; of 3 or greater. That is, any JI system must at least<br/>provide those pure intervals with an odd factor of 3 or less: namely<br/>octaves, fifths, and fourths. Optionally, a JI system may have an<br/>odd-limit of 5, 7, or higher.</p><p>A 3-limit system, for example, includes pure or just octaves (2:1),<br/>fifths (3:2), and fourths (4:3). A 5-limit system additionally<br/>includes pure major thirds (5:4) and minor thirds (6:5). A 7-limit<br/>system additionally includes 7-based versions of the major second<br/>(8:7), minor third (7:6), diminished fifth (7:5), and minor seventh<br/>(7:4). A 9-limit, 11-limit, or higher system will add yet other<br/>&quot;small-integer&quot; ratios (e.g. 9:7, 11:9, 13:8, 17:12, 19:16).</p><p>Note that this second requirement excludes some systems based on<br/>entirely on integer ratios which nevertheless do not meet a prime<br/>objective of JI: optimizing the tuning of stable concords to make them<br/>as blending as possible.</p><p>For example, in 1766, Johann Philipp Kirnberger proposed a method for<br/>approximating 12-tet by finding a series of pure fifths and thirds<br/>together forming a fifth of 16384:10935, an interval repeated 11 times<br/>to complete the system. Here all intervals are based on (very large!)<br/>integer ratios, and the system provides pure 2:1 octaves, but not pure<br/>3:2 fifths or 4:3 fourths. Thus Kirnberger&apos;s &quot;quasi-12-tet&quot; is not a<br/>JI system in our sense.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.3. Classic JI systems in context: Pure stable concords<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>To this point, our criteria for a JI system have been fairly<br/>objective: does the system base all intervals on integer ratios, and<br/>provide pure intervals up to an odd-limit of 3 or higher?</p><p>Our third criterion, however, depends not only on the tuning system<br/>but on the music to which it is applied.</p><p>In order to realize the ideal of just intonation _in a specific<br/>musical context_, the system must have an odd-limit high enough to<br/>provide pure intervals for all stable concords of the composition or<br/>style in question.</p><p>For example, a 3-limit system can beautifully realize the just<br/>intonation ideal of &quot;beatless stable concords&quot; for the music of<br/>Perotin, a Gothic composer of the era around 1200. However, it would<br/>not do intonational justice to the music of the 16th-century composer<br/>Orlandi di Lasso (1532-1594), which calls for a 5-limit system in<br/>order to make all stable concords pure or beatless.</p><p>Nor can a 5-limit system realize the ideal of just intonation when<br/>applied to music calling for 7:4 minor sevenths, or 11:9 neutral<br/>thirds; and so on.</p><p>Thus at its conceptual lowest common denominator, &quot;JI in action&quot;<br/>occurs when a tuning system meeting our first two objective criteria<br/>actually provides a full set of pure stable concords for a given<br/>musical composition, improvisation, or style.</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>1.4. Concord, discord, and contrast<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>While JI systems as here defined share in common the trait of<br/>providing pure ratios for all stable concords of a given music,<br/>such musics need not be limited to stable concords alone. Both<br/>&quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities regarded as relatively blending but<br/>unstable, and yet more tense &quot;discords&quot; felt urgently to seek<br/>resolution, can provide creative conflict and contrast in the<br/>unfolding of a composition or improvisation.</p><p>One serious misunderstanding about JI systems holds that such systems<br/>must seek pure or ideally concordant ratios for _all_ intervals --<br/>including those which may be intriguing dual-purpose sonorities or<br/>outright discords in a given musical style. In fact, a contrast<br/>between &quot;beatfulness&quot; in unstable sonorities and purity or beatless-<br/>ness in stable ones, like conflict in a novel or drama, can add to<br/>musical interest. Some JI systems make the most of this contrast when<br/>applied to an appropriate musical style.</p><p>For example, in the music of Guillaume de Machaut (1300-1377), both<br/>4:6:9 (e.g. G3-D4-A4) and 64:81:96 (e.g. G3-B3-D4) might be termed<br/>&quot;dual-purpose&quot; combinations; they are relatively blending, but<br/>unstable, always calling for further music. (Here I use a notation<br/>with C4 as middle C, with higher numbers showing higher octaves.) As<br/>it happens, 3-limit JI makes the first sonority ideally pure, and the<br/>second rather complex and &quot;beatful.&quot; Both the energetic fusion of the<br/>first sonority and the pleasant edginess of the second add to the<br/>flavor of the music.</p><p>Likewise, in the music of Monteverdi (1567-1643), a 5-limit tuning of<br/>10:15:18 for a sonority such as D3-A3-C4 lends the rather tense<br/>quality of the 9:5 minor seventh to this stylistically discordant and<br/>engaging combination. A theorist of the time, defending Monteverdi&apos;s<br/>boldness with such sonorities, describes them as a mixture of &quot;the<br/>sweet and the strong&quot;: both the pure fifth (3:2) and minor third<br/>(6:5), and the edgy minor seventh, might fit this ideal.</p><p>While many JI systems invite such contrasts, they are an optional<br/>feature; it is quite possible to compose music where _all_ intervals<br/>are regarded as stable concords, and have pure ratios included within<br/>an applicable tuning&apos;s odd-limit.</p><p>Thus JI musicians and advocates may differ not only in their choice of<br/>odd-limits and musical styles, but in their preferences regarding<br/>levels of contrast between concords, dual-purpose sonorities, and<br/>discords. Such varying tastes lend emphasis to the point that an ideal<br/>JI system for one kind of music may do great intonational injustice to<br/>another.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Just tunings and motivations: intonational relativity<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A curious consequence of our definition is that the same tuning may<br/>constitute a JI system when applied to one kind of music, but a non-JI<br/>system (quite possibly favored precisely as such) when applied to<br/>another kind of music.</p><p>For example, a 3-limit JI tuning can indeed realize just intonation in<br/>a musical sense for the Gothic polyphony of Perotin or Machaut. As<br/>discussed above, it not only provides pure ratios for all stable<br/>concords, but fits the intricate spectrum of concords, dual-purpose<br/>sonorities, and discords.</p><p>When the same tuning is applied to the music of Charles Ives[3], where<br/>thirds and sixths seem to serve as stable concords, the result is<br/>something quite in contrast to JI in a musical sense. Major and minor<br/>thirds, for example, have rather complex and &quot;beatful&quot; ratios of 81:64<br/>and 32:27 where their musical role would call in a JI interpretation<br/>for the ideally pure ratios of 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>From a musical point of view, the 3-limit tuning may in fact have<br/>almost opposite meanings for these two styles. In a Gothic setting,<br/>where thirds are unstable, their beatfulness lends point to the<br/>listener&apos;s secure expectation of a resolution sooner or later to<br/>stably concordant sonorities with ideally pure octaves, fifths, and<br/>fourths. In a setting such as the music of Ives, where thirds are<br/>treated as stable, their beatfulness instead may suggest a pervasive<br/>sense of restlessness and inconclusiveness, an &quot;Unanswered Question.&quot;</p><p>Additionally, the use of a 3-limit tuning in Ives might be, as the<br/>composer himself suggests, motivated by a desire to emphasize the<br/>melodic or horizontal dimension. Such a tuning provides narrow or<br/>compact diatonic semitones: Db is closer to C, for example, while C#<br/>is closer to D. Both this enhanced &quot;melodic pull&quot; of the semitones,<br/>and the pervasive vertical tension when a 3-limit tuning is applied to<br/>a music where thirds and sixths are stable concords -- or in other<br/>terms, are left unresolved -- may accentuate the discrete layers of<br/>the texture, the distinctness of the melodic lines.</p><p>Of course, the melodic factor of compact semitones may be just as<br/>important (and attractive) in Gothic music as in Ives; but here, this<br/>factor pulls in tandem with vertical resolutions from unstable<br/>sonorities to stable and purely intoned ones. Thus we have true JI in<br/>a musical sense, with the two dimensions in equilibrium. In Ives, the<br/>same tuning produces an artful disequilibrium.</p><p>If we define a JI system in terms not only of the tuning itself but of<br/>its interaction with a given musical style, then the same tuning can<br/>indeed be JI for Machaut and artful non-JI for Ives.</p><p>----------------------<br/>3. Adaptive JI systems<br/>----------------------</p><p>While classic JI systems realize _all_ intervals as integer ratios,<br/>&quot;adaptive JI&quot; systems include some tempered intervals based on<br/>irrational ratios, but nevertheless meet the second and third prongs<br/>of our test. That is, they provide a set of intervals based on<br/>low-integer ratios up to 3-odd-limit or higher; and when used for<br/>applicable musical styles, they provide such pure intervals for all<br/>stable concords.</p><p>In 1555, Nicola Vicentino describes such a system for his<br/>_archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; with 36 notes per octave. While<br/>his first tuning features a temperament dividing the octave into 31<br/>more or less equal parts, his second tuning is an adaptive 5-limit JI<br/>system when applied to the 16th-century music for which it was<br/>conceived, where all stable concords fall within a 5-odd-limit.</p><p>In this system, the 19 notes of the instrument&apos;s first manual (Gb-A#)<br/>are tuned in a meantone temperament[4] identical to his first scheme,<br/>likely a 1/4-comma tuning with pure 5:4 major thirds or something very<br/>close (by the mid-17th century, his tuning was being interpreted as<br/>31-tet). The remaining 17 notes of the second manual, however, are<br/>tuned in pure fifths with these. Thus if one plays a pure 5:4 major<br/>third on the first manual (e.g. C3-E3) -- assuming a 1/4-comma tuning<br/>for this manual -- and adds the version of the note G4 on the second<br/>manual, the result is a pure 5-limit sonority having also a 3:2 fifth<br/>and 6:5 minor third.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI involves a distinction between a basic gamut<br/>of _melodic_ intervals based on a tempered meantone, and an available<br/>set of _vertical_ intervals providing pure ratios for all the stable<br/>concords of Renaissance music.</p><p>Adaptive JI systems, then and now, may be especially attractive for<br/>tunings needing to juggle two or more odd prime factors, in<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 5-limit case both 3 and 5; and in more recent cases, often<br/>also larger primes such as 7, 11, 13, etc. If one builds such a system<br/>on integer ratios only, then complications such as awkward melodic<br/>shifts may result.</p><p>For 3-limit JI, the classic approach of deriving all intervals from<br/>integer ratios based on the powers of the primes 2 and 3 seems to<br/>avoid most of these complications, so there is less motivation for an<br/>adaptive approach.</p><p>-------------<br/>4. Conclusion<br/>-------------</p><p>In this article, I have attempted mainly to suggest that JI involves a<br/>meeting between a tuning system and a musical context in which the<br/>system can provide pure ratios for all stable concords.</p><p>This outlook of &quot;intonational relativity&quot; suggests that what is often<br/>called the &quot;out-of-tuneness&quot; of an interval in a given JI tuning when<br/>applied to a musical context demanding a higher odd-limit might rather<br/>be called &quot;out-of-styleness.&quot;</p><p>For example, in a musical context with stable concords calling for a<br/>5:4 major third or a 7:4 minor seventh, a 7-limit enthusiast might<br/>speak of a 3-limit major third (81:64) or 5-limit minor seventh (9:5)<br/>as being respectively about 22 cents and 49 cents &quot;out of tune.&quot;[5] In<br/>appropriate musical settings where the 3-limit or 5-limit can include<br/>all stable concords, however, these intervals could be regarded as<br/>perfectly in tune: they were never advertised to be beatless or<br/>stable, and the musical context may make them ideal exactly as they<br/>are.</p><p>If the question is stated as one of contextual &quot;out-of-styleness&quot;<br/>rather than inherent &quot;out-of-tuneness,&quot; then a difference in musical<br/>contexts may be clarified. The flaw lies not in the interval itself,<br/>but in a collision between the interval and the musical context.</p><p>While leaving many &quot;loose ends&quot; indeed loose[6], I have attempted to<br/>suggest an approach which may introduce newcomers to the variety of JI<br/>systems and the relativistic nature of JI as a meeting between such a<br/>tuning system and a musical setting where it can realize the ideal of<br/>pure stable concords. If this approach ultimately promotes more<br/>concord among people applying different JI systems to a variety of<br/>musics, it will have served its purpose.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Being aware of the dangers of attributing any innovation in tuning<br/>theory to a specific author when it may be found to go back centuries<br/>earlier, I would to thank Paul Erlich for bringing the term and<br/>concept of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; to my attention in a series of Tuning List<br/>posts. The concept, at least, would seem to go back at least to<br/>Vicentino&apos;s second archicembalo tuning of 1555 (see Section 3).</p><p>2. In a meantone temperament, the most popular keyboard tuning from<br/>around the later 15th to later 17th centuries, fifths are slightly<br/>narrowed or tempered in order to provide pure or near-pure major<br/>thirds. In 1/4-comma tuning, they are narrowed by 1/4 of a syntonic<br/>comma (81:80, ~21.51 cents), the difference between the active thirds<br/>and sixths built from pure fifths in a 3-limit tuning and the pure<br/>5-limit versions of these intervals. Since a major third is built from<br/>a chain of four fifths (e.g. F-C-G-A), a 1/4-comma tuning makes such<br/>thirds one comma narrower than the 3-limit 81:64, i.e. a pure 5:4.<br/>A cent is equal to 1/1200 octave, so that the equal semitones of<br/>12-tet are each 100 cents.</p><p>3. As already mentioned in the dedication at the beginning of this<br/>article, I am most deeply indebted to Johnny Reinhard, and especially<br/>to his discussions of intonation in Ives.</p><p>4. On meantone, see n. 2.</p><p>5. Since there are 100 cents in a 12-tet semitone (see n. 2), these<br/>are substantial differences -- about 2/9 and 1/2 of a semitone<br/>respectively.</p><p>6. Such loose ends might include, for example, JI systems based on one<br/>limit which are extended far enough to approximate closely the pure<br/>ratios of a higher limit, and are then applied to music with stable<br/>concords calling for such a higher limit. If such an extended system<br/>is applied to musical styles with all stable concords within its usual<br/>limit, then there is no definitional problem: it meets the test for<br/>classic (or adaptive) JI while offering some extra intervals for<br/>&quot;special effects.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=6257 href="#6257">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/1999 8:50:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[M.

A bit pedestrian, even bland in 12TET.  This was a movement<br/>specifically mentioned by Ives for its microtonal handling.  Specifically in<br/>reference to the C# being higher than the Db kind of thing.</p><p>If you clear your passions, 12TET is a tempered Pythagorean.  The full<br/>acceptance that an organist has for 12TET may stem from this aspect of Ives&apos;s<br/>life.  After all, his father George has a clear 5/4 bias as indicated by his<br/>theory writings, and perhaps by his being at heart a trumpeter.  Brass<br/>players make up their world based on the overtone series more than perhaps<br/>any other family of instruments.</p><p>When I first tried to picture J.S. Bach in Werckmeister III tuning there was<br/>an uprorar.  It seems that time has eased the virtual wall Academia had set<br/>up against early music tuning study.  Mark Lindley had a very rough time of<br/>it.  There are many stories to be sure.  But to hear J.S. Bach&apos;s &quot;Chromatic<br/>Fantasy&quot; in D minor in 12TET and to hear it in Werckmeister III is like the<br/>difference between a Milky Way candy bar and a Reijkstafel (Indonesian<br/>banquet).</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s like religion and we each have a belief system in a tuning<br/>operation that seems superior to any other.  Gee, that kind of thinking has<br/>been dangerous in many another semantic realm.</p><p>Ives is a microtonalist.  Even when he uses 12TET he is using it<br/>microtonally, for what it does best.  Specifically he mentions sequences that<br/>are not tonal.  And that this accounts for the minority of his music.  There<br/>is clearly another model at work.  And it&apos;s not the JI of Helmholtz.  Ives is<br/>suspicious (maybe Psychiatrist Feder would say his homoerotic love for his<br/>father found jealousy in his father&apos;s mentor - Helmholtz, whose book was<br/>_not_ found in Ives&apos;s library).</p><p>By sharpening up 12TET to the clarity of extended Pythagorean use develop the<br/>imagination of Ives.  To drown his sound in 5/4 is like decaffeinating his<br/>sound, to let the air out of his balloons.</p><p>If microtonality is to be a discipline it is important that we aid the<br/>research and understanding of past musics.  There has been stiff resistance<br/>in Academia, but it is melting.  Perhaps communication among our various<br/>theologies - as exemplified by this list - is the best thing we could be<br/>doing.</p><p>ohnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6266 href="#6266">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/1999 8:07:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Margo Schulter, TD 398.3:]<br/>&gt; Thus JI musicians and advocates may differ not only in their choice of<br/>&gt; odd-limits and musical styles, but in their preferences regarding<br/>&gt; levels of contrast between concords, dual-purpose sonorities, and<br/>&gt; discords.

We can now do<br/>what the original composers might themselves have done, had the means<br/>been available to them: change the tuning of a piece, microtonally, on<br/>the fly.  It seems to me the height of absurdity to require ourselves<br/>not to try these techniques out on existing music.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that new tools automatically imply improvements; I&apos;m well<br/>aware that we can create musical horrors just as easily.  Nor am I<br/>claiming that a given composer would have used or appreciated a<br/>particular tool; that, no one can know one way or the other, though it<br/>is fun to guess.

You wrote:</p><p>&gt;              A tuning system is a classic just intonation system<br/>&gt;              in the context of a specific musical composition or<br/>&gt;              style if:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              (1) All intervals in the system are defined as<br/>&gt;                  integer ratios;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              (2) The system provides a complete set of<br/>&gt;                  low-integer ratios up to an odd factor or<br/>&gt;                  &quot;odd-limit&quot; of at least 3; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              (3) This odd-limit is high enough to provide<br/>&gt;                  pure or low-integer ratios for all stable<br/>&gt;                  concords in the given musical context.<br/>&gt;<br/>Your requirement (2) seems extraneous. For music that uses stable octaves &amp;<br/>fifths, (2) is already contained in (3). With that caveat, I think you have<br/>given a useful definition for &quot;classic JI&quot;.</p><p>But I am sure I am not alone in thinking that music can use JI in<br/>non-classic ways. As Dan Wolf pointed out, music can use harmonious 7/4&apos;s<br/>and 3/2&apos;s without needing any ratios of 5. And I enjoy exploring some<br/>harmonious (to my ears anyway) scales that lack fifths entirely. In contrast<br/>to &quot;classic JI&quot; should we call such practices &quot;new JI&quot; (or maybe &quot;JI<br/>lite&quot;)...  ;-)</p><p>David Canright                <a href="http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/">http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/</a></p></div><h3><a id=6317 href="#6317">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/1999 9:25:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, your reply (TD 401.1) certainly beats out anything I could write<br/>in its graciousness and courtesy.
