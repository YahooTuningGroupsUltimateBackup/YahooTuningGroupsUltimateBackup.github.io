I now have a dozen<br/>and can get more if I need them and I am ready to roll.  The music I<br/>intend to make will be both harmonic and melodic and  I will have up to<br/>a maximum of 16 bowls. I&apos;d be grateful for your thoughts on how you<br/>would tune the bowls (any scale between 12 and 16 tones) and why you<br/>would choose your tuning. I&apos;ve a feeling that tuning the bowls to low<br/>-ish number ratios will be easier than to various EDOs and I doubt if I<br/>can go beyond 2 &quot;octaves&apos;&quot; range but I eagerly await your ideas or<br/>comments. Thanks in anticipation.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2001 8:23:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been saving up winemaking demijohns with a view to cutting and<br/>&gt; tuning them to make Partch-like Cloud Chamber Bowls.</p><p>This is partly a historical post, for a very simple reason.
