What you don&apos;t seem to realize<br/>(or acknowledge, maybe) is that the vast majority of those members on<br/>the other lists still belong to tuning, so they aren&apos;t missing out.<br/>And if you are concerned about a smaller subject area, you can simply<br/>join and read if you don&apos;t feel like participating.</p><p>&gt; Why shouldn&apos;t JI people not share with the bigger family?</p><p>Is there a JI list somewhere I don&apos;t know about?</p><p>&gt; How does what I do have any less to do with practical microtonal<br/>&gt; composition and performance?</p><p>Who said it does?</p><p>&gt; Ah, now I am less comprehending...</p><p>Only if the shoe fits, but I did not direct it personally, only that<br/>this is the same arguement that others had before. Tell someone that<br/>you want to find a mailing list on &quot;programming&quot; and ask them if<br/>there is one list that will give you information you need. Of course<br/>not - there would be dozens, hundreds of lists, as the subject is<br/>large and diverse, with more than enough interest to satisfy many<br/>smaller sub-groups.</p><p>And, when well-done, many members of these more tightly focused<br/>groups will tell you that finding something that speaks more<br/>specifically to their needs is valuable indeed. This doesn&apos;t stop<br/>people from sharing/reading in the larger arena, but also allows them<br/>to use their time more wisely and not have to delve into a lot of<br/>posts that aren&apos;t in their area of current interest.</p><p>&gt; Even though there are some things that interest me less (like lots<br/>&gt; of  numbers) I wouldn&apos;t want to do without it.  Why would anyone<br/>&gt; else risk losing something important that comes down the pike?</p><p>Well, I would just say that is a reasonable and personal response,<br/>and I don&apos;t have a problem with it. The fact is that others may not<br/>feel that way, and *don&apos;t* want to deal with posts that aren&apos;t<br/>germain to their work or interest.</p><p>&gt; This magnitude of different lists is retro.</p><p>It&apos;s a big world. We can all still communicate. And if microtonality<br/>ever becomes bigger than the little corner it is now, it won&apos;t be<br/>able to maintain a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; scenario.</p><p>&gt; What is not laughable is the creation of cliques within the<br/>&gt; microtonal community.</p><p>I was not aware that was what was happening. Certainly the people I<br/>work and correspond with don&apos;t feel that way. In fact, my sense is<br/>that for people participating in some of the other groups (and let&apos;s<br/>be realistic: we&apos;re only talking about 3 or 4 groups) have a sense of<br/>freedom of expression that isn&apos;t supported by the &apos;one group&apos;<br/>paradigm. The people at tuning-math can - and do - work tirelessly on<br/>new areas, free from listening to carping (from people like me!)<br/>about the preponderance of numerical activity. And at MMM, there are<br/>a number of people who really *do* work on current<br/>composing/performing/recording that maybe involves gear talk, or<br/>recording procedures, etc., that is just a tad outside of the tuning-<br/>centric theme of the main list.</p><p>Maybe clique can be used in a non-perjorative manner? I don&apos;t know,<br/>because I have known it as a somewhat degrading term, but if a focus<br/>group, with a clear mission, is a clique then so be it.</p><p>&gt; Speaking about people on lists where people are not on them might<br/>&gt; become a problem.</p><p>I have no idea that this relates to.</p><p>&gt; Why couldn&apos;t a group interested in a topic, say 3-5 persons, simply<br/>&gt; just tie there names together in a mailing?</p><p>I&apos;m sure they do. MMM currently has nearly 80 members (who obviously<br/>enjoy being there for *some* reason) and a mailing list would not be<br/>feasible. In fact, Yahoo groups are nothing more than a mailing list<br/>with a web-interface front end.</p><p>&gt; We don&apos;t have the mental or technological resources any longer<br/>&gt; to keep up with the microtonal world</p><p>You&apos;re giving up to easily.

I think the need for a separate group for that has long<br/>passed and I will not be visiting or contributing to it in future.</p><p>And why wasn&apos;t this discussion on meta-tuning (or is that<br/>meta_underscore_tuning or tuning-hyphen-meta). Oh I suppose it is<br/>by now, but I never remember to read _it_ either.</p><p>I think that meta-tuning (if people would use it), tuning-math and<br/>make-micro-music are the only splits so far that may have been<br/>worthwhile.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m heavily into addiction mode at present and need to go cold<br/>turkey on all the lists for a while.
