Yes, one wouldn&apos;t want to keep deleted posts.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit tricky, the deleted posts stay in the digests, with no indication<br/>that they have been deleted.</p><p>I wonder what we can do? I hadn&apos;t really thought this through.</p><p>The only place I know of that can be a source of information about whether<br/>a post is deleted is the on-line archive - look and see if it is there<br/>or not.</p><p>Now, it turns out that my program can deal with the cookies now,<br/>which it wasn&apos;t doing before (don&apos;t know what has changed,<br/>just tried it again today and suddenly it was working again,<br/>and checking in the debugger, it is getting and setting cookies<br/>too).</p><p>However, it still can&apos;t find the posts in the pages because<br/>they are converted to html, so it doesn&apos;t know where they<br/>begin and end (no &lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; tags).</p><p>They have also lost all the ascii formatting as well of course,<br/>as we know.</p><p>Tried the expand messages trick, and for some reason it just<br/>wouldn&apos;t work - my program gets sent a single html message<br/>instead of the page of plain text (&quot;formatted&quot; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;) messages</p><p>I can&apos;t figure that out at all, since the page is showing up okay<br/>in IE, so what is IE doing that my program isn&apos;t? Especially as<br/>view source is working. Nothing is involved about security or<br/>anything either.</p><p>If one could do that it would be back to the way it was before pretty<br/>much, and one could just download the archive, and forget about the<br/>digests.</p><p>However, for now, can&apos;t get that to work.</p><p>Another idea is to see if one gets the<br/>Oops, message ... doesn&apos;t exist in tuning type message.<br/>Then delete all the messages from the archive that one gets<br/>that for. That is a bit of a waste as you download all the<br/>messages just in order to find out which ones aren&apos;t there.<br/>Also would depend on exactly synchronising the digest<br/>numbers and the yahoo archive numbers - in theory they<br/>should synchronise exactly, but it seems the kind of thing<br/>where possibly they might go out of sync if there is any glitch<br/>anywhere.</p><p>Second best is that I make the archive, upload it, you<br/>look through it and make a file of the date fields for<br/>all the posts you want to delete (including both the date and<br/>the time). Then I remake the archive with those removed,<br/>and re-upload it.</p><p>I.e. you&apos;d go to</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~tuning_archive/tuning_digests/html/s___1/author___1.html">http://members.tripod.com/~tuning_archive/tuning_digests/html/s___1/author___1.html</a><br/>and make a list like this:<br/>Mon, 19 Nov 2001 19:19:42<br/>Mon, 19 Nov 2001 21:01:45<br/>...<br/>but only for the ones you want removed. You&apos;d need to do it for<br/>each section in the archive.</p><p>That would work. Might be a bit tedious for you to find all the posts to delete.<br/>Programming seems pretty straightforward, one only needs do that once.<br/>I&apos;d upload the archive with all the posts hidden from search<br/>engines via meta tags, then re-upload it once one had made<br/>the list of posts to delete.</p><p>Another thought, what if in the meanwhile we do the<br/>archive, and I add a note to it saying that it has<br/>some messages deleted from the original archive,<br/>maybe at the top of each page of messages,<br/>brief, with link for more information about it?</p><p>Maybe there is something else that will solve it. But anyway,<br/>that&apos;s the situation at present. If I leave it a couple of days<br/>and come back to it, maybe some other thought will occur.<br/>Or, might Yahoogroups eventually be persuaded to change the<br/>messages back to plain ascii? Then I wouldn&apos;t need<br/>to do anything at all, just use the archiving program<br/>as it is.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2002 5:46:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Ok, I&apos;ve added you in, thanks.</p><p>Well, I&apos;m no lawyer, I don&apos;t suppose you are either?<br/>Who knows what the exact legal situation is, I think one<br/>would need expert advice.</p><p>However,</p><p>&gt; &gt;I did it out of respect for the views of members.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s fine.</p><p>Let&apos;s just leave it at that then.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2002 5:50:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Pete,</p><p>&gt; Just for the record (?) I must say that I think the archives should<br/>&gt; be &apos;opt-out only&apos; at their most generous, however confounding this<br/>&gt; may be for the archivist, because I think that all of the posts are<br/>&gt; so revealing of all of us in these times that they should be<br/>&gt; preserved as much as possible in toto as a recording of what we<br/>&gt; really are, and not what we&apos;d like to be remembered for.</p><p>&gt; I hope you&apos;ll take this with no small thanks for even considering<br/>&gt; responsibility for any part of this massive effort!</p><p>&gt; And wondrous appreciation for your artistic contributions as well!</p><p>Looks as if you want to be in the archive anyway.

Well, I guess the opposite view would say<br/>that, unless Yahoo goes &quot;belly up&quot; all the more recent posts are<br/>still available.  Posts like the old Mills posts are still totally<br/>inaccessible... at least *I* don&apos;t know how to find them, so some<br/>might say having these *older* posts on a Website is an even *more*<br/>valuable pursuit.  Just an opinion...</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 1:51:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>&gt; Thanks for all this work! Well, I guess the opposite view would say<br/>&gt; that, unless Yahoo goes &quot;belly up&quot; all the more recent posts are<br/>&gt; still available.

Just an opinion...</p><p>Ah right,I see that.</p><p>I was thinking that one would need to go all the way back to them.<br/>But if I do it as a separate archive, and leave out the ones in<br/>between, I&apos;ve still got a dozen megabytes or so free on teh web<br/>site.</p><p>Of course, it will have rather a lot of gaps in it as one is<br/>going a fair way back. Let&apos;s hope some of those who posted<br/>then and no longer do find it on-line.</p><p>Anyway with all the gaps it will be smaller, and perhaps it may<br/>fit in the space available.</p><p>I&apos;ll see what I can do. Some more progamming to do for it too, as I<br/>mentioned.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2004 4:48:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Just to say  - sorry the tuning-maths archive upload<br/>is a delayed - the one which I plan to do with<br/>the tool tips dictionary and fix the numbering of the<br/>posts.</p><p>Maybe it will be later this week, maybe next week, or so<br/>- it depends how other things go. I have thought a bit<br/>about how to do it when I set down to do the coding and<br/>it seems straightforward, so it probably won&apos;t take long<br/>once I set to it.</p><p>I&apos;ll probably do the last few months of the tuning archive at the same<br/>time, when I do the tuning-math upload.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
