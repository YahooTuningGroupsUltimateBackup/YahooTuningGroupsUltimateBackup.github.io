Experiencing lean times from the<br/>excesses and bloated financial expectations of the early seventies,<br/>major record companies tightened their belts, investing in nothing but<br/>sure-bet megagroups or their clones. Free-form FM radio died and<br/>programming fell completely under the control of paid &quot;consultants&quot;<br/>who dictated what musical mush would yield the maximum number of<br/>listeners. Under these conditions, musicians even marginally outside<br/>the plain vanilla mainstream had no choice but to create and circulate<br/>their music via self-developed means and channels.</p><p>Equally significant during this period, technologies emerged which<br/>allowed musicians to create increasingly sophisticated recordings<br/>without relying on large commercial studios. Audio cassettes and<br/>recorders developed into a surprisingly high-fidelity medium and<br/>provided an accessible means of distributing independent music.<br/>Musician-produced recordings have since thrived in an environment of<br/>four-track cassette portastudios, affordable synthesizers with<br/>remarkably detailed sound, digital delay and reverb units, sampling<br/>machines, and of course the Musical Instrument Digital Interface<br/>(MIDI). Along with digital audio technologies, the much-lauded<br/>phenomenon of MIDI has brought equipment costs down and allowed<br/>greatly enhanced compatibility between instruments, processors, and<br/>even recording machines.</p><p>Being an &quot;electronic musician&quot; and shameless tech-head, I might be<br/>expected to join the ranks of those praising such developments to the<br/>heavens. But since I consider myself a troublemaker first and a<br/>musician second, and considering the fact that there appear to be more<br/>than enough praise-singers here and about, you&apos;ll have to indulge my<br/>playing devil&apos;s advocate in the present instance. My task here is to<br/>examine the neglected underside of these developments.</p><p>What underside? Since hardware has only become<br/>&quot;faster-cheaper-better,&quot; and standards for equipment compatibility and<br/>control have exceeded any expectations, one may well wonder what there<br/>is to bitch about. Ten years ago independent musicians certainly found<br/>life more difficult and more expensive. In the area of electronic<br/>music, synthesizers were only slowly coming to programmability; one<br/>might work for hours to attain a particular sound on a<br/>patch-cord-style machine, and have only a dim possibility of<br/>recreating it with any accuracy at a later time. Such synths were<br/>typically monophonic, time-consuming to program, bulky, and pricy. The<br/>workhorse home&quot; multi-track tape recorder at the time, the Teac 3440,<br/>was considerably more costly than later portastudio-type machines, and<br/>of course additionally required an external mixing board. As far as<br/>the most essential sound processor--reverb--the situation was even<br/>worse; manufacturers continually struggled to produce the least<br/>crappy-sounding spring reverberation, few having much success, and not<br/>many musicians self-producing their recordings could afford the cost<br/>or space requirements of the much-preferred plate reverbs. In<br/>retrospect it all seems to have been unbearably difficult; every<br/>production was a challenge to one&apos;s resourcefulness and innovative<br/>craftiness. Many times things seemed held together with spit and<br/>exhibited a fidelity to match, by today&apos;s standards. But at least in<br/>the days of modular and other non-programmable synthesizers, we didn&apos;t<br/>turn on the radio and hear the same patch over and over again. The<br/>3440 did and still does offer superior sound to any cassette<br/>portastudio. And as far as reverb units...well, that one is a bit<br/>tougher to justify, but let&apos;s at least say that the truly adventurous<br/>who built their own plates or pressed unoccupied bathrooms and<br/>stairwells into service certainly had something special to show for<br/>their efforts.</p><p>Today, of course, much higher sound fidelity is attainable, we have<br/>access to more, ah, beautiful sounds, the price of outfitting a home<br/>studio is within reason for many, and naturally of greatest importance<br/>these days--it is all so much easier. The current hot item is the<br/>&quot;workstation,&quot; a piece of gear incorporating keyboard, multiple-voice<br/>synthesizer, realistic sampled instruments (usually including several<br/>full drum kits), delay, reverb, and other processors, and a digital<br/>multi-track sequencer/recorder. As the ads say, &quot;Now you can get down<br/>to the real business of making music,&quot; the dirty job of creating sound<br/>and schemes for assembling it into unique music now out of the way!</p><p>But it seems that innovation is now an optional ingredient rather than<br/>a necessary one. Current digital wonders are relatively cheap and easy<br/>to use, but without the requirement of innovative approaches, many<br/>musicians leave out the innovation part altogether. The most frequent<br/>and damning criticism of today&apos;s &quot;home studio&quot; music productions is<br/>that they all sound so similar. With vastly increased possibilities,<br/>and manufacturers telling us that we are &quot;limited only by our<br/>imagination,&quot; why does one hear so many independent cassette<br/>recordings that sound virtually identical?</p><p>The fact is that most of our expanded technical capability has come<br/>about through that mixed blessing of modern civilization, mass<br/>production. The palm-top digital reverb unit only exists because the<br/>potential sale of a hundred thousand of the little suckers subsidized<br/>the whole affair. (I own one myself, but what are the implications of<br/>a dozen or so sounds spread amongst tens of thousands of users?) Out<br/>of necessity large corporations design products for Mr. Average<br/>User--as average and bland as possible, in fact. But does that<br/>describe you and your music? If so, you&apos;ve probably read too far<br/>already.</p><p>Perhaps most curious of all is that musicians not only accept this<br/>middle-of-the-roadism, but often don&apos;t even meet manufacturers&apos; modest<br/>expectations of them. A common story in synthesizer repair departments<br/>is that units brought in for work frequently contain only the original<br/>factory preset sounds, the famously creative musicians never having<br/>even tried to come up with any of their own. And the manufacturers<br/>listen! Now we find, in many cases, newer models of equipment which,<br/>rather than employing more developed soundcrafting possibilities,<br/>actually revert to less capable (easier to use) versions, even of<br/>inferior sound quality.</p><p>I have met musicians who own home studios which almost literally<br/>contain &quot;one of everything.&quot; And within each of the devices which are<br/>programmable, guess what you&apos;ll find? Yup--factory junk, milquetoast<br/>sounds for milquetoast music. My argument here is that one does not<br/>need to be a major stockholder in Yamaha or Roland to produce<br/>interesting, vital music. (They even dragged me into it for a couple<br/>of years, promising heaven-with-a-MIDI-cord-attached, but I got wise.)<br/>We don&apos;t need one of everything, we don&apos;t need stacks of MIDI synths<br/>and $10,000 samplers. We need innovation and original approaches.<br/>Don&apos;t use factory synthesizer patches; don&apos;t buy factory disks for<br/>your sampler--it was made to use your sounds. Look into &quot;obsolete&quot;<br/>gear like non-programmable synths, ring modulators, and analog delays.<br/>Use a transducer driver to run your voice through a suspended<br/>refrigerator rack on its way to your vocal track, put some alligator<br/>clips on your guitar strings, use a mixer to add more regeneration to<br/>effects than the manufacturer would normally allow.</p><p>What&apos;s most difficult to obtain today is interesting music. Been to a<br/>record store lately? I haven&apos;t found much.
