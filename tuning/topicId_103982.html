I&apos;ll go over to<br/>the xenharmonic wiki and read some of the grammar and do my homework.<br/>In the book, he writes about the Jorgensen comma and how it<br/>distributes among the intervals, but I don&apos;t get how it works in<br/>combination of your answer. In the end, the 5 and 7 temperament is a<br/>selection of twelve tones taken from the 70 equal tones to the octave<br/>about an hour ago &middot; Like</p><p>Melle Weijters &lrm;(oops, entered too early...) and then the word scale<br/>might be the best way to describe it. But, reading the whole chapter,<br/>he was quite serious about it.<br/>about an hour ago &middot; Like</p><p>Paul Erlich What is the Jorgensen comma??<br/>about an hour ago via mobile &middot; Like</p><p>Melle Weijters and I quote: &quot;the Jorgensen comma is the excess of 41<br/>octaves over 70 fifths. &lt;insert math&gt; 1.03715 which in rounded numbers<br/>is 63.15 cents in size. The fourths F Bb and F# B are each narrowed by<br/>exactly 1/70 Jorgensen comma, and the fifths Bb F and B F# are each<br/>widened by exactly 1/70 Jorgensen comma. Thus the ratio of the fifths<br/>Bb F and B F# is &lt;insert match&gt; The effect of the latter fourths and<br/>fifths is similar to that of Just Intonation. All the white key fifths<br/>are narrowed by a little more than 1/4 Jorgensen comma and all the<br/>black key fifths are widened by approximately 57/200 Jorgensen comma.&quot;<br/>about an hour ago &middot; Like</p><p>------------</p><p>So the &quot;Jorgensen comma&quot; could perhaps be said to correspond to the<br/>val &lt;70 111|, or to this 5-limit temperament then, which I suppose<br/>should be &quot;Jorgensen temperament&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=140_70&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=140_70&limit=5</a></p><p>It tempers out 2596148429267413814265248164610048/2503155504993241601315571986085849.</p><p>I doubt it&apos;s practically useful in any meaningful sense, but I suppose<br/>historically interesting.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
