Unaccompanied vocal music will wait even longer to<br/>&gt;re-emerge, and indeed becomes especially problematic to tune (try, for<br/>&gt;example, Brahm&apos;s _In stiller Nacht_).</p><p>I did, thanks to Mark Nowitzky, TD 447.4, and I took that &quot;good ol&apos;<br/>equal-tempered MIDI format&quot; and ran it through the wringer, and...<br/>it sure sounds vivid!  Daniel, the subtleties of tuning choices that<br/>you discuss in TD 442.5 aren&apos;t understood by the program, so (and<br/>perhaps for other reasons as well) you may find the sound far from<br/>ideal, but I&apos;d be interested in your reaction (luckily, the piece is<br/>short!).</p><p>As an alternative to the piano, I also used a string voice and a<br/>french horn voice, each in separate files.

This one took some digging to answer...</p><p>[Mark Nowitzky, TD 450.15:]<br/>&gt;Looks like a fun basement project you got going there...</p><p>Yes, it keeps me busy, and the incoming flack keeps me from being bored<br/>(I guess, if I dish it out, I&apos;ve gotta take it!).</p><p>&gt;I liked the french horn files the best!</p><p>Kyool; I was shooting blind in choosing voices.  Most synths, even good<br/>ones, make a horrible mess of the &quot;human&quot; voices, so I skipped&apos;em.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve got some feedback/questions/comments on the tunings you chose for<br/>&gt;the Brahms piece:</p><p>&gt;1)  I viewed your 5-Limit Horn MIDI file (bra-stil-hrnz5.mid) under an<br/>&gt;editor, and saw a lot more pitch wheel values than I expected to see.<br/>&gt;How come the tonic (key) of the piece, Eb, drifts around so much?  I<br/>&gt;understand the need for more remote tones to drift, such as F or C in<br/>&gt;this piece.  But why does your Adaptive JI algorithm move ALL the notes<br/>&gt;on EVERY chord change?</p><p>Good question!  The answer is that I first decide how to tune each of<br/>the pitch12&apos;s (the pitch, C ... B, with octave information removed)<br/>relative to 12-tET, and then decide how best to &quot;center&quot; the resulting<br/>chord.  That centering motion is often strongly influenced by notes<br/>(pitch12&apos;s) that are continuously sounding and are instructed to try not<br/>to change pitch much.</p><p>More specifically, the piece is in the key of Eb, so, why not hold Eb<br/>fixed?  Part of the answer is that my program doesn&apos;t &quot;know&quot; that the<br/>piece is in Eb (though it does &quot;know&quot; that Eb chords begin and end it!),<br/>so doesn&apos;t know which pitch12 to hold fixed.  But even if that were<br/>known, to hold the Eb fixed would mean that other pitch12&apos;s would have<br/>to move more, which can mean more total &quot;pain&quot; according to the way I<br/>weight things.</p><p>The question of ideal centering of chords is a very difficult one, and<br/>I&apos;m becoming more convinced, with help from feedback on this list, that<br/>my methods don&apos;t do a very good job some of the time.  More on that in a<br/>later post!</p><p>&gt;2)  The second chord in the piece is Ab Cb Eb F (an Ab minor triad with<br/>&gt;an added sixth).  Here&apos;s how you tuned it (in bra-stil-hrnz5.mid), and<br/>&gt;how I would tune it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    your choice    my choice<br/>&gt;    -----------   -----------<br/>&gt;    NNN*  ratio   NNN*  ratio<br/>&gt;    ----  -----   ----  -----<br/>&gt;    4F    10/9    4F    10/9<br/>&gt;    5Eb    1/1    5Eb    1/1<br/>&gt;    5Cb   64/81   6Cb    4/5<br/>&gt;    5Ab    2/3    5Ab    2/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    *where NNN = Nowitzkian Note Names (per<br/>&gt;&lt;<a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/nnn.htm">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/nnn.htm</a>&gt;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Why do you choose the more Pythagorean tuning for the Cb, instead of<br/>&gt;opting for the simpler 4/5 ratio?  Is the presence of the 4F = 10/9<br/>&gt;affecting your choice?  Or would you also tune a vanilla minor triad<br/>&gt;that way too?</p><p>Well, I&apos;ll be @#$%^&amp; if that isn&apos;t the same chord as in the Bach piece<br/>that I analyzed in TD 405.2, in a different key of course.  Here, as<br/>there, my program picks an unexpected chord: in this case, it calls<br/>it a Db 9 with missing root!  Therefore, the Cb is tuned to 8/9 of Db<br/>simply because that&apos;s the ratio I put in my tuning file (I&apos;m taking your<br/>pick, as I recall, for when there really is a dom7 or dom9).  As you<br/>point out, this makes it a Pythagorean third from Eb.</p><p>In 7-limit tuning, the Db 9 (with root missing) sounds really lovely,<br/>IMHO, but in 5-limit it&apos;s probably flat out a bad choice.  In the Bach,<br/>Paul E recommends, as you do, tuning the minor triad properly, and I<br/>agree (in 5-limit only!).</p><p>&gt;3)  Around the fifth measure of the piece, there&apos;s a Bbdom7 chord (Bb<br/>&gt;Ab D F).  Here&apos;s how you tuned it in your 7-Limit Horn sample<br/>&gt;(bra-stil-hrnz7.mid):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    note   NNN   ratio<br/>&gt;    ----   ---   -----<br/>&gt;     F     5F     9/8<br/>&gt;     D     4D    15/8<br/>&gt;     Ab    n/a   21/16<br/>&gt;     Bb    5Bb    3/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I suppose that if I ever used septimal harmony (7-Limit tunings), maybe<br/>&gt;I&apos;d tune it the same way you did.</p><p>And, as you may know, my habits and my ears are tuned to septimal!  (but<br/>I&apos;ve gotta get better at satisfying you 5-limit guys...).</p><p>&gt;I was surprised as I listened and compared this to the 5-Limit tuning.<br/>&gt; The 7-Limit version sounded more &quot;fluttery&quot;.  (By &quot;fluttery&quot;, I mean<br/>&gt;I heard rapid beats; it felt dissonant.)  I would&apos;ve thought that the<br/>&gt;7-Limit tuning would be more smooth.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;m not sure why you experienced that!</p><p>&gt;So once again I question my own theory about dominant seventh chords<br/>&gt;&lt;<a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/dom7.htm">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/dom7.htm</a>&gt;.  Pat Missin&apos;s<br/>&gt;harmonica samples, discussed at the bottom of that web page, had just<br/>&gt;the opposite effect.</p><p>Do you get the same sensation in the other voices?  I&apos;m mystified; my<br/>own experience with 7&apos;s is that they&apos;re smooth, oh so smooth.  In their<br/>own uniquely twangy kind of way, of course...</p><p>JdL</p></div>
