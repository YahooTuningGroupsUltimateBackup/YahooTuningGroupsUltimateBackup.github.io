True, some of our players who<br/>are realy Musicians Union die-hards bawked at having to play in other than<br/>the sacrosanct 12-tet, but a gaggle of their 8- and under kids took up the<br/>idea with enthusiasm.<br/>One suggestion: the Stravinsky seemed a bit commonplace amid the other<br/>pieces. I think a piece by Varese such as &quot;Hyperprism&quot; would work nicely. I<br/>have a MIDI-controlled siren for that purpose, and the sonorities would be<br/>oh! so striking in some temperament other than our usual.<br/>The kids suggested an encore that, I think, would be quite fun. From Karl<br/>Orff&apos;s &quot;Music for Children&quot;, that blown-out setting of &quot;The Camels are Coming.&quot;<br/>Yours truly,<br/>Rollo<br/>At 10:11 AM 12/2/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: David Beardsley &lt;<a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dear Bandleader:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Re:our daughters wedding, we do want a few requests played if you<br/>&gt;don&apos;t mind.
