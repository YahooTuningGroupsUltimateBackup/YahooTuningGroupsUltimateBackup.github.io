The second row is the<br/>diaschisma; the first is 393216:390625 -- but 15552:15625, the<br/>kleisma, and again the diaschisma provide a simpler and more common<br/>way of definining 34-tET. The kleisma itself implies a minor-third<br/>generator, and I believe this was most important in Larry Hanson&apos;s<br/>investigations into 34-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was looking for two 17-note structures seperated by a 13/8, with<br/>more<br/>&gt; &quot;5&quot;s than &quot;3&quot;s in the indivdual structures, since stacks of 5&apos;s<br/>remain<br/>&gt; consistnt longer than stacks of 3&apos;s.
