The quotes from Hafner&apos;s article, submitted<br/>earlier by Paul Erlich, well explain the concept, although there are<br/>deviations from his rule for finding the best transposition of<br/>meantone for each piece.  My notes on testing some of Bach&apos;s cycles<br/>of clavier pieces for meanness of intonation are now posted at<br/><a href="http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~jolliff">www.dslnorthwest.net/~jolliff</a> .  The method of rotating the wolf to<br/>accommodate each set holds up in a majority of cases, and where it<br/>does not, still provides insight regarding which orientation of<br/>unequal temperament would work.  The Well Tuned Keyboard contains<br/>enough adventurous dissonance aside from issues presented by<br/>meantone, that mistuned intervals can be seen in some cases as<br/>another tonal resource.  But yes, it is a tuning lesson, intended to<br/>train the ear, along with the hands and musical imagination.</p></div>
