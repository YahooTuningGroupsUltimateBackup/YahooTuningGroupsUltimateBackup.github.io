Fascinated by<br/>gamelan music, Asian rhythmic and tuning systems, and endowed with a<br/>musical sense of adventure and experimentation like no other, Lou<br/>Harrison has written some of the most innovative music of the<br/>century: long before it became an innovation in cuisine, Lou Harrison<br/>embraced &quot;Pacific Fusion.&quot; Harrison&apos;s Piano Concerto was written for<br/>and first performed by Keith Jarrett with the ACO and Davies in 1985.<br/>The specially tuned piano (all the white keys are tuned to &quot;just<br/>intonation&quot; and the black keys to fourth and fifth intervals) opens<br/>up a new melodic world in the first movement that is reminiscent of<br/>the Indonesian gamelan.

Neither score recommends a tuning. Did he ever specify anything? I<br/>play them on harpsichord which is NEVER in equal temperament, so far I<br/>haven&apos;t had an &apos;aha!&apos; moment where I think I&apos;ve found one that makes the<br/>Harrison sound suddenly new.</p><p>Judith Conrad, Clavichord Player (<a href="mailto:jconrad@tiac.net">jconrad@tiac.net</a>)<br/>Music Minister, Calvary Baptist Church, Providence, RI<br/>Director of Fall River Fipple Fluters<br/>Piano and Harpsichord Tuner-Technician</p></div>
