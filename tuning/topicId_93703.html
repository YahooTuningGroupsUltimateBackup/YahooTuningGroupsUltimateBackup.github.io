This also helps understanding the structure.</p><p>The diatonic scale is the locus classicus for this kind of scale. It&apos;s a seven note scale, and since it is so well-supplied with harmony, it should not surprise us that the cycle of the 2/7 pitch class, the cycle of thirds, has all consonances. If M is the majr third and m is the minor third, this cycle goes MmMmmMm. This leads to a corresponding cycle of triads, where the mm triad is the diminished triad, an approximate 6/5-6/5-10/7 chord implying the 126/125 comma.</p><p>We can try the same kind of analysis on the seven-note scales in my collection, and a similar analysis for the other scales. Consider prop7a. This has a 2/7 cycle which goes MmmmmMf, where M is a slightly sharp major third, m a slightly flat minor third, and f a flat major third. The corresponding cycle of triads goes MdddMaa, where M is a major triad, d is a diminished triad, and a is an augmented triad.</p><p>Prop7b: The 2/7 cycle is MfMSMMS, where S is an approximate 8/7. The corresponding triads are augmented, augmented, 5/4-8/7-10/7, 8/7-5/4-10/7, 5/4-5/4-11/7, 5/4-8/7-10/7, 8/7-5/4-10/7.</p><p>Prop7c: The 2/7 cycle is MmMsMMs, where s is a subminor third, an approximate 7/6. The corresponding triads are major, minor, 5/4-7/6-16/11, 7/6-5/4-16/11, augmented, 5/4-7/6-16/11, 7/6-5/4-16/11.</p><p>Prop7d: The 2/7 cycle is MmzmMmM, where z is approximately 19/16 but functions more as 25/21. Triads are major, 6/5-z-10/7, z-6/5-10/7, minor, major, minor, augmented.</p><p>Prop7e: the 2/7 cycle is MmmMMSM, where S is approximately 8/7. The corresponding triads are major, diminished, minor, augmented, 5/4-8/7-10/7, 8/7-5/4-10/7, augmented.</p><p>Prop7f. This has a 2/7 cycle of MMSMMtM, where t is an approximate 15/13, M is a major third and S a supermajor second. The triads are augmented, 5/4-8/7-10/7, 8/7-5/4-10/7, augmented, 5/4-15/13-13/9, 15/13-5/4-13/9, augmented.</p><p>Prop7g. This has a 2/7 cycle consisting of MMSMMSM, where M is a major third and S a supermajor second: an approximate 8/7. The corresponding triads are simply what you get by assuming the intervals are just, and the whole cycle completes based on a 3136/3125 comma.</p><p>Prop7h: The 2/7 cycle is Mmnnnnm, where n is a neutral third. The triads are major, 6/5-11/9-19/13, neutral, neutral, neutral, 11/9-6/5-19/13, minor.</p></div><h3><a id=93721 href="#93721">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2010 3:32:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Prop7c: The 2/7 cycle is MmMsMMs, where s is a subminor third, an approximate 7/6.
