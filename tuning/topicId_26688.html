I red<br/>&gt; he used some unusual intervals, and he is one of my favourite composers, so<br/>&gt; I decided to buy the score. Indeed, the first mouvement Hora lunga (1994) is<br/>&gt; a monody, to be played entirely on the low C-string of the viola. Ligeti<br/>&gt; makes use of the natural intervals (pure major third,  pure minor seventh<br/>&gt; and also the 11th harmonic). The harmonics of C serve as a model. Nothing<br/>&gt; spectacular in itself, if it wasn&apos;t that Ligeti is a leading composer and<br/>&gt; it&apos;s conforting to notice that, whenever folkmelodies (in this case<br/>&gt; Romanian) are referred to, Just Intonation seems to be approved as a better<br/>&gt; tool for this musical language.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard, perhaps this is an idea for Anastasia, since she&apos;s already<br/>&gt; collaborating in your coming AFMM Festival. Congratulations, by the way!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Wim Hoogewerf</p><p>Whilst looking for new material to play on the bouzouki some years ago, I came across Bartok&apos;s<br/>transcriptions of the many folk melodies that he had collected from around Hungary and Romania.<br/>The Hora Lunga appears to have been one of the most prevalent forms on both flute and fiddle.<br/>Though the transcriptions I have are largely notated in standard notation, the original recordings<br/>are a microtonal dreamworld and  Ligeti has done no more than remain true to his folk roots,<br/>albeit with a measure of compositional mastery. One day I might resurrect these gems and try to<br/>find suitable scales with which to play them.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div>
