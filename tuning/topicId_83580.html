I couldn&apos;t for the life of me figure out how the major scale was formed and what basis it had in the harmonic series. I even did a small presentation in a music class using a small melody based on this scale. I never did well in the class. This probably was not why.</p><p>The major scale is actually based on a union of I, IV and V triads. If you stuck to harmonizing with those three chords, there would be no comma-pumping and head-scratching with the 5-limit JI scale. The accoustic scale, however, is based on only one chord, the harmonic 13th. The melodies played on this scale would have the quality of &quot;being&quot; music, which doesn&apos;t have the feeling of progress or going places. Rather than progressing between chords in cadences, it just sits on one chord (albeit an extended one) and be&apos;s a melody.</p><p>In actual practice, the melody would probably linger on this scale for awhile, and then modulate to another fundamental and continue from there. Then you would have something akin to the Bartok style.</p><p>It may be worth noting that the 5th mode of this scale is the melodic minor.</p><p>Billy</p></div>
