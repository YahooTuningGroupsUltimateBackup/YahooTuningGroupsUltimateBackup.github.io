You seem to have<br/>&gt; fallen prey to what you identified in your book &quot;Lies My Music Teacher Told<br/>&gt; Me&quot; as lie #6: A scale is a series of eight fixed pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider the following progression in the key of C major:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 Cmaj7   Dmin7   Emin7   Fmaj7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         S:      B       C       D       E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         A:      G       A       B       C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         T:      E       F       G       A<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         B:      C       D       E       F<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that both the soparano(S) and the baritone(B) sing the sequence C, D,<br/>&gt; E. I expect that they would tune the steps differently. I would expect the<br/>&gt; soprano to sing C, D, E as a 9/8 followed by a 10/9, and the baritione to<br/>&gt; sing a 10/9 followed by a 9/8.</p><p>I appreciate that &quot;dynamic tuning&quot; goes on during harmonic changes (which is<br/>of course the whole point of Lie #6), however the context of my comment<br/>(quoted above) had to do with isolated major seconds. Since, as I reported,<br/>hearing an isolated minor third seems to evoke an imagined &quot;phantom root&quot;<br/>completing a &quot;mistakenly perceived&quot; major triad, I wondered if an isolated<br/>9:10 major third would also evoke a &quot;phantom root&quot; which would logically<br/>place the 9:10 major second where it &quot;naturally&quot; occurs in the partials<br/>series over a fundamental.</p><p>In any case, your post appears to contain an interesting observation, albeit<br/>misapplied to mine. Okay, I&apos;ll bite. Why would the soprano and baritone sing<br/>those particular major seconds in that context?</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>1/15/2000 9:58:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;Gerald Eskelin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stg3music@earthlink.net">stg3music@earthlink.net</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;Why would the soprano and baritone sing<br/>&gt;those particular major seconds in that context?</p><p>Consider the lattice of tones in which going up to the left means<br/>multiplying by 5/4 and going up to the right means multiplying by 3/2:</p><p>                     B          D</p><p>                E         G</p><p>            A        C</p><p>        D       F</p><p>Note that there are two different D&apos;s: the one in the lower left corner is<br/>tuned 10/9 relative to C while the one in the upper right is tuned 9/8. The<br/>former will be used in Dmin7 while the latter will be used in Emin7 (as<br/>well as G7). I then works out, by multiplying the 3/2&apos;s and the 5/4&apos;s (and<br/>then multipying or dividing by the appropriate power of 2 to bring the<br/>results between 1 and 2), that the progression I gave in my previous post<br/>would be tuned as follows:</p><p>        Cmaj7        Dmin7        Emin7       Fmaj7</p><p>S:      B 15/8       C 1/1        D 9/8       E 5/4</p><p>A:      G 3/2        A 5/3        B 15/8      C 1/1</p><p>T:      E 5/4        F 4/3        G 3/2       A 5/3</p><p>B:      C 1/1        D 10/9       E 5/4       F 4/3</p><p>So the soprano sings C, D, E as 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, implying a major second of<br/>9/8 followed by 10/9, while the baritone sings C, D, E as 1/1, 10/9, 5/4,<br/>implying a major second of 10/9 followed by 9/8.</p><p>I hope that the lattice is helpful to you not only in this example but also<br/>in understanding ratios involving higher numbers. I find it indispensible.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div>
