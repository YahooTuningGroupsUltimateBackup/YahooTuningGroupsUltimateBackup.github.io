You give it your parameters and it generates an interval.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Another example, with a different &quot;fifth&quot;:<br/>&gt;&gt;n=6<br/>&gt;&gt;f=9/8=204c<br/>&gt;&gt;t=2/1=1200c<br/>&gt;&gt;so, y=204+(1200-(204*6))/6=200c.</p><p>&gt;Well that&apos;s not meantone. Yes, there are many scales that are analogous to &gt;meantone...</p><p>I was just concerned with representing the generative procedures in<br/>the most general way possible.  You see, this is where the section<br/>you&apos;re reading fits into the big picture:  this is the description of<br/>an object-oriented class library.  My tuning class uses interval<br/>objects.  Interval objects are represented as a fuzzy amount of<br/>pitch distance (which, of course, can also return a crisp value).<br/>The intervallic tunings are just handy ways of generating interval<br/>objects by parameter, according to a few well-known paradigms.<br/>E.g., like the generalization of the Pythagorean paradigm above.<br/>When these interval objects get put into a tuning object later,<br/>and the tuning algorithm is run on them, they&apos;ll probably get<br/>tempered then, which is why I neglected to write down a meantone<br/>interval-generating formula (why temper beforehand, I thought).<br/>After having talked to you about it though, I think it&apos;s an interesting<br/>resource, and I should include it.  I was trying to think of a general<br/>form of the procedure to generate meantone intervals. Is the following<br/>inadequate?:<br/>y=g+(t-(g*n))/n<br/>where g is the generating interval, t is the target interval and n is<br/>the number of transpositions.  I suppose there are other ways of<br/>doing it---e.g., giving a maximum n and letting the computer figure<br/>out the n that best approximates t.</p><p>&gt;&gt;So that formula determines the tempered interval described<br/>&gt;&gt;by the parameters.</p><p>&gt;Well, often there are more than two intervals involved in the compromise . &gt;. .</p><p>You&apos;ve lost me then---so what would the parameters be?</p><p>&gt;perhaps it would be more interesting if you could explain your generalized &gt;JI paradigm the way you&apos;ve explained your generalized Pythagorean paradigm.</p><p>I think generating them by giving lattice coordinates would be better<br/>than what I described in the thesis, but then I was steeped in Partch<br/>and maybe it&apos;s a decent alternative.  The idea was that JI intervals are<br/>all representable as O/U, so that there are an infinite number of them.<br/>So, the trick was to have just enough parameters to limit them to a<br/>finite set and then refer to them in ascending order or by approximation<br/>to a given interval. Keeping track of the different combinations of<br/>parameters necessary to do that gets a bit confusing, and so I think<br/>a lattice-based interface would be better in most cases.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=23313 href="#23313">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 11:21:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Well, often there are more than two intervals involved in the compromise .<br/>&gt; &gt;. .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve lost me then---so what would the parameters be?</p><p>In meantone tuning, there are only three interval classes involved in the compromise.</p><p>One fifth approximates a 3/2.<br/>Three fifths minus an octave approximates a 5/3.<br/>Four fifths minus two octaves approximates a 5/4.</p><p>In the MIRACLE tuning (as just one of many &quot;species&quot; analogous to meantone we&apos;ve come up<br/>with), there&apos;s a generator, and the following (very close) approximations obtain:</p><p>Two generators approximate an 8/7.<br/>Five generators appoximate a 7/5.<br/>Six generators approximate a 3/2.<br/>Seven generators approximate an 8/5.<br/>Eight generators minus an octave approximate a 6/7.<br/>Thirteen generators minus an octave approximate a 6/5.<br/>Fifteen generators approximate an 11/4<br/>(there are also approximations to 11/5, 11/6, 11/7, and 11/9 . . . you can work out what they<br/>would be from the above).</p><p>There can also be paradigms defined by multiple chains of a generator.

Define your intervals fuzzily.  E.g.,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;One generator approximates a 4/3.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Two generators approximate a 7/4.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Three generators approximate a 7/3.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;A half-octave approximates a 7/5.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Two generators minus a half-octave approximate a 5/4.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Three generators minus a half-octave approximate a 5/3.</p><p>&gt;Well, that&apos;s not a complete list of intervals. The complete list of &gt;intervals would be obtained by using the formula<br/>&gt;a generators + b/2 octaves<br/>&gt;where a and b run through all possible integers.</p><p>No, no---the point is that you define only the intervals you&apos;re concerned<br/>about---those you want your scale to approximate.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s easier to visualize, however, if we imagine defining our personal<br/>&gt;&gt;opinion of an interval simply as a Gaussian bell-shaped curve peaking<br/>&gt;&gt;(=1) at 4/3, having a width (full width at half maximum) corresponing<br/>&gt;&gt;to how much deviation from a pure interval is acceptable, and approaching<br/>&gt;&gt;zero for intervals far from 4/3.</p><p>&gt;Yes, that&apos;s good enough, as long as you know which fuzzy interval is &gt;approximating which ratio.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any possibility for being confused about it.  In the code,<br/>you would say something like:<br/>Interval perfectFifth=new JIIntervalicTuning({-1,1})<br/>(assuming the JIIntervalicTuning constructor took lattice notation).<br/>You just name the instance of the object appropriately.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I expect we would agree that more<br/>&gt;&gt;complex intervals can bear less tempering than simpler ones, so that<br/>&gt;&gt;4/3 would be a bit wider than 5/4, and so on.</p><p>&gt;A bit wider, but a bit deeper, too.</p><p>Here there&apos;s a trivial transform, since, though these are optimization<br/>problems, fuzzy logic is phrased in terms of 1=absolutely desireable<br/>and 0=absolutely forbidden.  I doubt you would want to represent,<br/>say, 7/6 as less than absolutely desirable as a pure septimal minor third,<br/>though.</p><p>&gt;&gt;2. Define a network of these intervals between the scalar degrees.<br/>&gt;&gt;(Assuming you&apos;ve defined the structure of the scale, its spelling,<br/>&gt;&gt;that is, to suit yourself.)</p><p>&gt;This and the following can all be seen as &quot;optional&quot;. What I&apos;ve given above &gt;is sufficient to calculate one sort of optimal temperament for the paradigm &gt;in question.</p><p>Optional if you want exactly and only your form of optimal meantones<br/>without considering a more general optimization! Maybe a different<br/>example is in order.  Try to forget your meantone procedure for a moment<br/>and consider this:</p><p>Define a scale with three degrees and three intervals:<br/>C--F = ~4/3<br/>F--Bb = ~4/3<br/>C--Bb = ~7/4<br/>where the tilde signifies fuzziness---represented as funtions of preferability<br/>or &quot;goodness&quot; vs. pitch distance, peaking (=1) at the above intervals and<br/>dropping off to 0.  Let&apos;s say they&apos;re Gaussian curves with a width that<br/>depends on your personal preference.  Also, C=256Hz.<br/>My algorithm does this: for F, it finds all the pathways back to C:<br/>F--&gt;C, F--&gt;Bb--&gt;C.<br/>Similarly for Bb:  Bb--&gt;C, Bb--&gt;F--&gt;C<br/>The one-interval pathways already have a fuzzy interval definition, but<br/>the two-interval pathways don&apos;t.  So, for F--&gt;Bb--&gt;C we have to add the<br/>abscissae of the two fuzzy functions together. This is done by convolving<br/>them, an operation which produces one fuzzy interval peaking at 21/16---<br/>the curve incorporates all the information of the two convolved curves,<br/>in this trivial example, resulting in a broader curve of similar character.<br/>Now, there are two fuzzy intervals (one for each pathway) claiming to<br/>define the ideal position of F.  They are resolved together (combining<br/>all the available information) by multiplication---f(x)=f_1(x)f_2(x).<br/>this yeilds a curve peaking somewhere between 4/3 and 21/16---an<br/>optimally tempered F, based on the criteria of how important we think<br/>the intervals are (in this case, how narrow the bell is).</p><p>I purposely chose Gaussian curves for this example because they&apos;re<br/>equivalent to your least-squares regression.  But look at all the possibilities<br/>in this system:<br/>--You needn&apos;t use such simple curves---e.g., they can have multiple peaks<br/> (e.g., for various pure thirds) or they can be based on dissonance models.<br/>--You needn&apos;t define intervals of the scale that aren&apos;t important to you.<br/>--You needn&apos;t weight all the intervals from one interval class equally (and<br/> you can allow them to be slightly unequal).<br/>--You needn&apos;t depend on the generator to decide what interval classes are<br/> going to appear in your scale.<br/>It&apos;s all more flexible, more general. It&apos;s like an optimization with many<br/>independent variables (all the degrees to be tuned) rather than  one<br/>independent variable (the size of the generator). With Gaussian curves<br/>for the fuzzy intervals, all equally weighted, this method should produce<br/>the same results as your procedure---it&apos;s a subset of the behaviors of<br/>Rusty tuning (which was the goal of Rusty tuning).</p><p>-m<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=23557 href="#23557">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2001 12:28:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;A.
