This may be so, mainly for novelty, but, hopefully, also for quality. I have come to know Sarod, Sitar, Flute, Tabla and Guitar players who not only contribute creatively to the genres mentioned above, but also are very good players of Indian classical music on their instruments. Now, a few suggestions for your consideration:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know Indian music uses a different temperment AND<br/>&gt; scale. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>The best way to become familiar with the Indian classical music temperments and scales, is to listen to a lot of Indian classical music -- especially vocal music. This will help you develop intuition required for tuning and for discerning the microtones.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, I have some instruments<br/>&gt; that can be tuned in cents, such as keyboards, but how can I know<br/>&gt; when the instrument is in tune? I supose I need to know the exact<br/>&gt; frequency of each pitch in an octave and have a device that can<br/>&gt; measure the frequency being played by the instrument. Still, before &gt; I can do that I need something that allows me to see or calculate &gt; &gt; the exact frequency of each note, maybe a book?

Maybe I should just go buy a sitar, but then I still wouldn&apos;t know how to tune it. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Michael, allow me to give you an advice born out of 20 years of experience, and further confirmed since 1992 when I moved to the U.S., and started teaching and performing: Please do NOT use a tuner to learn tuning; use the tuner ONLY to test the accuracy of your tuning, at the very end of the tuning process. And, it is better still not to use tuner regularly. It is better to work with a genuine Indian musician (preferably a singer) for a short time. [Always tell him about your objective clearly, because you may not go the Guru-Shishya parampara (traditional, elaborate training) way and spend<br/>10 years with him].</p><p>I hope this helps,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
