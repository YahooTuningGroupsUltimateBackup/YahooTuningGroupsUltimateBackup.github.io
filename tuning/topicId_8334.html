Call a 6:7 a 6:7, I say... And really the same could go for<br/>various equal temperaments, referring to the number of steps in an interval,<br/>for example: 5of22. For other types of intervals, cents values tell the<br/>whole story. In each of these cases, numbers convey an unambiguous interval.<br/>To me, names are much less clear and more arbitrary, and typically rooted in<br/>a particular harmonic practice. As such, they can tend to limit one&apos;s<br/>thinking when composing... Even the term &quot;octave&quot; bugs me, since it assumes<br/>a heptatonic scale; I have long advocated &quot;double&quot; instead.</p><p>Of course, when trying to communicate with those versed in traditional music<br/>theory, I suppose it can be helpful to use terminology based on other terms<br/>they already know...

The meantones will end up with B:F as a diminished fifth (approx 7:10) and the Pythagorean tunings will have it as a subdiminished fifth (approx 5:7). Of course it can be argued that 7-limit distinctions are irrelevant to diatonic scales and in this case we should simply call them all tritones (as per Graham Breed).</p><p>[Paul H.

Somethings gotta give (between chains-of-fifths and low-limit ratios), so I say let it give here.</p><p>The chains-of-fifths note-names ensure that familiar things happen when you modulate by fifths or fourths (the most common modulations by far), and the interval names tell you roughly what they sound like. Both of these properties are independent of the tuning (assuming it _has_ fifths and other JI approximations).</p><p>What better way to point out to someone (versed in standard music theory only) that the syntonic comma doesn&apos;t dissapear in 22-tET, than by saying &quot;In this tuning, the major third from C isn&apos;t E, it&apos;s a step lower at E\.&quot;?</p><p>When we know we&apos;re dealing with decatonic scales, the \&apos;s can be absorbed into some kind of key signature so that the major third from C _does_ look like E on the staff and if we need the supermajor third we use an accidental natural E|.</p><p>We can almost have our cake and eat it too.</p><p>Much of the following I wrote to Paul off-list in December.</p><p>A minimum-modifiers symmetrical decatonic is</p><p>B\ C C#\ Eb E\ F F#\ G A\ Bb (B\)</p><p>We also want to use certain enharmonics from time to time, to give the right spelling.

The parenthesis around a sharp in the key signature indicates that the \ applies to the sharpened note but the sharp itself isn&apos;t part of the key sig. Similarly for the flats. Other keys would have unparenthesised sharps or flats in their key sig.</p><p>The key signature below is way too ugly, but all the information is there.

A 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7 (minor supermajor 6th) looks like a minor major 6th (half diminished 7th). A 10:12:15:18 looks like a minor 7th (which it is). A 8:10:12:15 looks like a major 7th (which it is). Likewise all the 1,5,7,9 (Paul&apos;s terminology) chords look like what they are and so do the 1,4,6,9&apos;s.</p><p>As Paul pointed out, a lot of dissonant chords look consonant under this scheme. This is similar to the diminished chord in diatonic but there are more to keep track of.</p><p>The above notation implies a (12-note per octave) keyboard mapping. A symmetrical decatonic would omit the D and G#Ab keys.</p><p>The keyboard mapping suggests a way of adaptively tuning decatonics in 22-tET. The algorithm could be constantly figuring out whether you were more likely to modulate up or down (by a fifth) and would be retuning those keys to either D and G#\ or D\ and Ab. For any more complicated modulation it would have to retune the note _after_ you hit the key.</p><p>The pentachordal scale would not use the D or A keys but these would be tuned to D and A\. An upward modulation would retune Eb to D#\. A downward modulation would retune G#\ to Ab. A pair of footswitches could _force_ modulations. Getting a bit off-topic here.</p><p>If we were introducing decatonics into a vacuum, your [Paul E&apos;s] notation would be fine.

In the C dominant seventh chord &quot;acoustically&quot; tuned, the Bb is closer to<br/>the E below--a diminished fifth.</p><p>What&apos;s that you say? Common practice is not the only music system in<br/>existence? Well, I&apos;ll be hornswaggled! You mean some composers could care<br/>less about acoustic reality and four hundred years of practice? I&apos;ll be<br/>damned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or putting them both in C major, B:F (7:10) contracts in resolution to C:E<br/>&gt; (4:5) and F:B (5:7) expands in resolution to E:C (5:8), not because of<br/>&gt; their initial sizes but just because of where the nearest _diatonic_ notes<br/>are.</p><p>Hold on there, Mr. K. B-F in the key of C is not 7:10 over a C fundamental;<br/>it&apos;s 7:10 over a _G_ fundamental--the dominant of C. Therefore, when B is<br/>the upper member it is the 10 of 7:10, an augmented fourth (F up to B) and<br/>goes to C; and when F is the upper member it is 7 of 5:7, a diminished fifth<br/>(B up to F) and goes down to E. Therefore, since 7:10 is larger than 5:7,<br/>their initial sizes are related to where they will resolve.</p><p>&gt; Of course whether B:F is closer to 5:7 or 7:10 depends on your tuning.</p><p>Not on _my_ tuning--on &quot;nature&apos;s&quot; tuning (if one accepts the principles of<br/>&quot;functional harmony&quot;). If you want to resolve them the other way, you<br/>certainly can. To me, the resolution of an augmented fourth is predetermined<br/>by its &quot;larger&quot; tuning.</p><p>&gt; I have assumed something tending toward meantone above (since these are<br/>&gt; optimum for diatonic). For tunings tending toward (or beyond) the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, B:F would be closer to 5:7 which one might then call a<br/>&gt; &quot;Pythagorean diminished fifth&quot;, or (as I&apos;d prefer) a &quot;subdiminished fifth&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry. I don&apos;t speak Pythagorean. (And I suspect my ears don&apos;t either.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Remember, Paul and Joe hold that &quot;context is everything.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s certainly very important, and the system, as explained on my web page,<br/>&gt; <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/IntervalNaming.htm">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/IntervalNaming.htm</a> allows for alternative<br/>&gt; names for the same ratio in different contexts, as with 5:7 = aug 4th =<br/>&gt; subdim 5th above.</p><p>Perhaps we could simply agree to disagree on this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;(You don&apos;t suppose Mr. Fokker would reconsider these, do you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Too late, you say?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As in &quot;the late Mr Fokker&quot;, yes.</p><p>As you correctly interpreted, I was being facetious here. It might be<br/>considered that during Fokker&apos;s productive years, the principle of tonality<br/>was being seriously challenged by Schoenberg and friends. It seems likely<br/>that his use of these interval terms were intentionally &quot;nonfunctional.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Okay. Do you suppose he&apos;d mind if we messed with it a bit?)</p><p>(Still being facetious, in the sense that it is out of touch with JI<br/>principles.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.

We&apos;re talking about different musical systems here, as<br/>you clearly point out as this paragraph continues...</p><p>&gt; would be screwed if we swapped these two. To be fair<br/>&gt; to Mr Fokker, strictly speaking, he gave the names to the intervals of<br/>&gt; 31-tET (a meantone), not to the JI ratios which they approximate. The<br/>&gt; latter seems like an obvious move to many people, but I understand that<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich is still dubious about it because of the apparent disagreement,<br/>&gt; in the case of 22-tET (and other super-Pythagorean tunings), between the<br/>&gt; A-G, #, b, /, \ names for the notes, based on chains of approximate 2:3&apos;s,<br/>&gt; and the Fokker-style names for the intervals, based on the 11-limit ratios<br/>&gt; most nearly approximated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 22-tET intervals from C to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C   perfect unison<br/>&gt; C/  super unison<br/>&gt; Db/ minor second<br/>&gt; D\  neutral second<br/>&gt; D   major second, supermajor second<br/>&gt; Eb  subminor third<br/>&gt; Eb/ minor third, neutral third<br/>&gt; E\  major third<br/>&gt; E   supermajor third<br/>&gt; F   perfect fourth<br/>&gt; F/  super fourth<br/>&gt; F#\, Gb/  augmented fourth, diminished fifth<br/>&gt; G\  sub fifth<br/>&gt; G   perfect fifth<br/>&gt; Ab  subminor sixth<br/>&gt; Ab/ minor sixth<br/>&gt; A\  neutral sixth, major sixth<br/>&gt; A   supermajor sixth<br/>&gt; Bb  subminor seventh, minor seventh<br/>&gt; Bb/ neutral seventh<br/>&gt; B\  major seventh<br/>&gt; C\  sub octave<br/>&gt; C   perfect octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally, I don&apos;t have a problem with that.

The 9:7 and 7:6 are the natural diatonic major and minor<br/>thirds in this tuning, based on the way they fall in the scale.  The o- and<br/>-utonal 6:7:9 chords function as 1-3-5 triads exactly like the 4:5:6&apos;s<br/>function in a meantone diatonic.</p><p>Dave, I hope you don&apos;t take me wrong on this issue.

By the way, diatonic music with high-limit<br/>chromatic harmony is one of the most fertile grounds in tuning theory in my<br/>opinion, and I have plans to explore it in depth one day, when your naming<br/>scheme will very likely be handy to me.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Canright, David &#x3C;dcanright@nps.navy.mil&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2000 10:53:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; (Graham Breed wrote:)<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; Anyway, David Canright wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Call a 6:7 a 6:7, I say...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like it or not, a lot of people will be turned off the subject if they<br/>&gt; see a lot of numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And really the same could go for<br/>&gt; &gt; various equal temperaments, referring to the number of steps in an<br/>&gt; &gt; interval, for example: 5of22.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but it may not be intuitively obvious to all that, say, 15of46 is<br/>&gt; the nearest approximation in that temperament to 5:4.  Saying 15of46<br/>&gt; is the 5-limit major third is a simple way to state this.  Say that<br/>&gt; you&apos;re playing a 5-limit major third and nobody need care what<br/>&gt; temperament your using.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For other types of intervals, cents values tell the whole story.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh no they don&apos;t!  The major third has a different size in different<br/>&gt; meantones, but the set of all meantone major thirds can be referred to<br/>&gt; as &quot;meantone major thirds&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may also want to describe a note with so much vibrato that it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have a single cents value.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In each of these cases, numbers convey an unambiguous interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; To me, names are much less clear and more arbitrary, and typically<br/>&gt; &gt; rooted in<br/>&gt; &gt; a particular harmonic practice. As such, they can tend to limit<br/>&gt; &gt; one&apos;s thinking when composing...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ambiguity is bad for mathematicians, but can be good for artists.<br/>&gt; There&apos;s also a general human tendency to name things.  Ratios are<br/>&gt; strongly linked to one harmonic practice: just intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course, when trying to communicate with those versed in<br/>&gt; traditional music theory, I suppose it can be helpful to use terminology<br/>&gt; based on<br/>&gt; other terms they already know...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But still, explaining the numbers is not much tougher<br/>&gt; &gt; than explaining exactly which &quot;augmented second&quot; one means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assuming you have one particular augmented second in mind.  A lot of<br/>&gt; the time, calling it a minor or subminor third would be good enough<br/>&gt; for me.  I like a bit of ambiguity, although not so much as to use 12<br/>&gt; pitch classes for everything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I want my augmented second tuned to 7:6, I&apos;ll call it a 7:6<br/>&gt; subminor third.  If you&apos;ve never met a 7:6 before, you will at least<br/>&gt; know that I&apos;m talking about a 7-limit consonance.  You could work out<br/>&gt; what size it is, but you already know it&apos;s slightly flat of a normal<br/>&gt; minor third.  Redundancy is good in general communication.

But apparently my interpretation was not necessarily the<br/>intent of such lists, because...</p><p>You are talking about _categories_ of intervals, a distinct but related<br/>idea. So in your list where you say, e.g.,<br/>showing the number of steps from 41 pitch classes,<br/>  9 7:6         subminor third               Eb\         G\\<br/>this would seem to mean that the term &quot;subminor third&quot; would apply to any<br/>interval in pitch class 9of41, (from 248.8c to 278.0c), which category would<br/>include the interval 9of41 (263.4c) and the interval 6:7 (266.9c) and<br/>presumably 5of24 (250c). This would be consistent with your naming of the<br/>neighboring pitch classes 8of41 and 10of41. But where you have more than one<br/>name with the same 41-ET representation (commas to limmas) you must mean<br/>smaller ranges, and perhaps where you skip 41-ET classes you mean the names<br/>cover larger ranges...? Actually, I suspect you sometimes mean categories<br/>(like &quot;major third&quot;) and sometimes mean specific intervals (like &quot;septimal<br/>comma&quot;).</p><p>IMHO, it is important to distinguish categories of intervals (e.g. &quot;thirds&quot;)<br/>from particular intervals (e.g. 272.3c).

Because my ear seems to be limited to JI? Because my brain seems to<br/>&gt;be limited to common practice. Because I appear to be limited in<br/>&gt;general? :-)</p><p>Much simpler than that. It&apos;s because you wrote either &quot;augmented fourth (7:10)&quot; or &quot;diminished fifth (5:7)&quot; (I forget which) in an earlier message. And because it&apos;s a common misconception, partly blameable on the ubiquitousness of 12-tET (where of course they are the same size).</p><p>&gt;But....but.....but.....but 7:10 fits the partial series (of C) as Bb _up_ to<br/>&gt;E--an augmented fourth in a dominant seventh chord belonging to the key of<br/>&gt;F. In the C dominant seventh chord &quot;acoustically&quot; tuned, the Bb is closer to<br/>&gt;the E below--a diminished fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What&apos;s that you say? Common practice is not the only music system in<br/>&gt;existence? Well, I&apos;ll be hornswaggled! You mean some composers could care<br/>&gt;less about acoustic reality and four hundred years of practice? I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;damned.</p><p>That&apos;s not what I&apos;m saying at all.</p><p>Ratios with odd-factors greater than 5 are irrelevant to diatonic music, with the possible exception of ratios of 9. 7&apos;s don&apos;t matter. They are only involved in functional _dissonances_.</p><p>This is a somewhat &quot;religious&quot; issue but I contend that a dominant 7th chord is not (should not be) an approximate 4:5:6:7 chord. A 4:5:6:7 is much more consonant and should be called a subminor 7th or (German) augmented 6th chord.</p><p>A dominant seventh chord has a _minor_ third stacked on a major triad (not a _subminor_ third).</p><p>So what you say above, is true only if you replace &quot;dominant&quot; with &quot;subminor&quot;, but we would no longer be in the realm of diatonic scales.</p><p>&gt;Hold on there, Mr. K. B-F in the key of C is not 7:10 over a C fundamental;<br/>&gt;it&apos;s 7:10 over a _G_ fundamental--the dominant of C.</p><p>If B:F (B up to F) is closer to a 7:10 than a 5:7 then that&apos;s true no matter what other notes it is over. I assume we&apos;re not talking about dynamic retuning and we are both assuming the convention of writing the notes of an interval or chord with pitch ascending from left to right. Yes, the B:F forms part of the G7 chord and is closer to 7:10 than 5:7 in most reasonable diatonic tunings of that chord. So it seems we agree.</p><p>&gt;Therefore, when B is<br/>&gt;the upper member it is the 10 of 7:10, an augmented fourth (F up to B) and<br/>&gt;goes to C; and when F is the upper member it is 7 of 5:7, a diminished fifth<br/>&gt;(B up to F) and goes down to E. Therefore, since 7:10 is larger than 5:7,<br/>&gt;their initial sizes are related to where they will resolve.</p><p>Ok. We disagree. Same problem. dominant 7th chord is closer to 4:5:6|5:6 than 4:5:6:7. 5:6 + 5:6 is closer to 7:10 than 5:7.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Of course whether B:F is closer to 5:7 or 7:10 depends on your tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Not on _my_ tuning--on &quot;nature&apos;s&quot; tuning (if one accepts the principles of<br/>&gt;&quot;functional harmony&quot;). If you want to resolve them the other way, you<br/>&gt;certainly can. To me, the resolution of an augmented fourth is predetermined<br/>&gt;by its &quot;larger&quot; tuning.</p><p>We don&apos;t disagree on how the notes resolve, or what the intervals are called. Our only disagreement is what JI ratio they best approximate. The only way you could be right is if the scale was tuned with fifths _wider_ than 700 cents (on the Pythagorean side of 12-tET, a &quot;negative&quot; meantone). And as you probably know, this would give very bad major and minor thirds (assuming we&apos;re still trying to be diatonic).</p><p>&gt;Perhaps we could simply agree to disagree on this.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>&gt;It might be<br/>&gt;considered that during Fokker&apos;s productive years, the principle of tonality<br/>&gt;was being seriously challenged by Schoenberg and friends. It seems likely<br/>&gt;that his use of these interval terms were intentionally &quot;nonfunctional.&quot;</p><p>No. Absolutely not. They are perfectly sensible terms for extended meantone tunings. Even Paul and Carl agree with that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes. The whole system<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And this is the rub. We&apos;re talking about different musical systems here, as<br/>&gt;you clearly point out as this paragraph continues...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; would be screwed if we swapped these two. To be fair<br/>&gt;&gt; to Mr Fokker, strictly speaking, he gave the names to the intervals of<br/>&gt;&gt; 31-tET (a meantone), not to the JI ratios which they approximate. The<br/>&gt;&gt; latter seems like an obvious move to many people</p><p>Not different systems. One is merely a superset of the other. 31-tET is an extended meantone and contains perfectly ordinary diatonic subsets. Their Fokker interval names are completely standard and uncontrovertial.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But one does need to know (at<br/>&gt;&gt; least) whether the tuning being used has G# &lt; Ab or G# &gt; Ab.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Exactly. To me, there is no question about it.</p><p>So which is it, G# &lt; Ab (meantone) or G# &gt; Ab (Pythagorean)</p><p>Show me a tuning of a diatonic scale that has a reasonable approximation to 4:5:6:7 as its &quot;dominant 7th&quot; (while all the major and minor triads still work). It can&apos;t be done.

You can work them out in any<br/>schismic temperament from that.  Each interval is defined as the nearest<br/>approximation to the ratio on the right.  This ensures consistency between<br/>different temperament classes.  The equivalent intervals in the upper<br/>tritone can be chosen through simple transformations:</p><p>major   &lt;--&gt;   minor<br/>super   &lt;--&gt;   sub<br/>wide    &lt;--&gt;   narrow</p><p> 41   29  octave                 C           E       2:1<br/> 37   26  (narrow) major seventh B           Eb\    15:8<br/> 35   25  wide minor seventh     Bb/         D       9:5<br/> 30   21  (narrow) major sixth   A           C#\     5:3<br/> 28   20  (wide) minor sixth     GA/         C       8:5<br/> 24   17  perfect fifth          G           B       3:2<br/> 21   15  wide tritone           F#/         Bb     10:7</p><p>Then, we have to decide what &quot;wide&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot; mean.  The classic<br/>&quot;wideness&quot; interval is the syntonic comma, 81/80.  This is one step in<br/>both 29 and 41=, and is associated in schismic temperaments with the<br/>modifier /.</p><p>For &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;super&quot; the classic interval is the septimal diesis of<br/>36:35.  This is 2 steps in 41=, and associated with two / modifiers in<br/>schismic notation.  The general pattern of modifiers is as follows:</p><p> +2 super        //<br/> +1 wide         /<br/>  0 perfect<br/> -1 narrow       \<br/> -2 sub          \\</p><p> +2 supermajor   //<br/> +1 wide major   /<br/>  0 narrow major<br/>  - neutral<br/>  0 wide minor<br/> -1 narrow minor \<br/> -2 subminor     \\</p><p>So major and minor intervals come in wide/narrow pairs whereas perfect<br/>intervals have narrow and wide alternatives.  The &quot;supermajor&quot; has to be<br/>super of &quot;narrow major&quot; so that 8/7 is a &quot;supermajor second&quot;.</p><p>Tritones are a law unto themselves.</p><p>For the notation to be consistent, the difference between &quot;narrow major&quot;<br/>and &quot;wide minor&quot; should always be the same, and so the approximation to<br/>25:24.  This follows from 5-limit consistency.  These names don&apos;t fit<br/>5-limit inconsistent tunings very well.</p><p>If the 25:24 happens to approximate to an even number of steps, there are<br/>uniquely defined neutral intervals.  Otherwise, there will either be no or<br/>ambiguous neutral intervals.  (25/24 is *not* the template I would use for<br/>augmentation or diminution, if I were to use such things.)</p><p>For 7-limit inconsistent tunings, &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;super&quot; are not clearly<br/>defined.  As David Canright implied, they would equate to 1 step in 24= as<br/>anything else would be silly.</p><p>In the 11-limit, &quot;super&quot; has to mean 33:32 for 11:8 to be a super fourth.<br/>Where this is not the same as 36:35, some compromise will have to be made.<br/>Either distinguish between &quot;septimal super&quot; and &quot;undecimal super&quot;, or<br/>sacrifice consistency and go for the nearest interval by default.  55:54,<br/>56:55 and 45:44 can variously be used for &quot;wide&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot; in a manner<br/>only consistent with 41=.</p><p>Anyway, applying these rules to 22= gives the core intervals:</p><p>11 tritone             7:5,10:7<br/> 9 perfect fourth        4:3<br/> 7 narrow major third    5:4<br/> 6 wide minor third      6:5<br/> 3 narrow major second  10:9<br/> 2 wide minor second    16:15<br/> 0 unison                1:1</p><p>The syntonic comma is 1 step, so we can fill the whole scale with wide and<br/>narrow intervals:</p><p>11 tritone             7:5,10:7<br/>10 wide fourth          11:8<br/> 9 perfect fourth        4:3<br/> 8 wide major third      9:7<br/> 7 narrow major third    5:4<br/> 6 wide minor third      6:5<br/> 5 narrow minor third    7:6<br/> 4 wide major second     9:8<br/> 3 narrow major second  10:9<br/> 2 wide minor second    16:15<br/> 1 narrow minor second  25:24<br/> 0 unison                1:1</p><p>Although these are not the usual names for the 7- and 11-limit intervals,<br/>it looks like the best way to consistently name 22= in a diatonic manner.<br/>Comparing it with David Keenan&apos;s latest:</p><p>11 F#\, Gb/  augmented fourth, diminished fifth<br/>10 F/  super fourth<br/> 9 F   perfect fourth<br/> 8 E   supermajor third<br/> 7 E\  major third<br/> 6 Eb/ minor third, neutral third<br/> 5 Eb  subminor third<br/> 4 D   supermajor second, wide major second (8:9)<br/> 3 D\  neutral second, narrow major second (9:10)<br/> 2 Db/ minor second<br/> 1 C/  super unison<br/> 0 C   perfect unison</p><p>&quot;Super&quot; and &quot;wide&quot; are synonyms, as are &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot;.

And<br/>well-tuned tritones do the job better than any piano could ever dream of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a somewhat &quot;religious&quot; issue</p><p>(I think I just illustrated that point with my passionate outburst. :-)</p><p>&gt; but I contend that a dominant 7th<br/>&gt; chord is not (should not be) an approximate 4:5:6:7 chord.</p><p>Why not? What do you have against consonance? Did you _believe_ your theory<br/>teacher when he/she said &quot;The seventh partial is quite unusable in<br/>traditional music&quot;? Wow! What a waste!</p><p>&gt; A 4:5:6:7 is<br/>&gt; much more consonant and should be called a subminor 7th or (German)<br/>&gt; augmented 6th chord.</p><p>I have no trouble with &quot;subminor 7th,&quot; but a 4:5:6:7 has nothing to do with<br/>an augmented sixth chord (spell Ab-C-EborD#-F#). Listen to a good string<br/>quartet play an augmented sixth chord and you will never bring up that<br/>argument again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A dominant seventh chord has a _minor_ third stacked on a major triad (not<br/>&gt; a _subminor_ third).</p><p>You&apos;ve go to be kidding! Why would a pitch sensitive singer/player be<br/>satisfied with a 12-tET seventh when an acoustic one is much more<br/>expressive?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what you say above, is true only if you replace &quot;dominant&quot; with<br/>&gt; &quot;subminor&quot;, but we would no longer be in the realm of diatonic scales.</p><p>Ta-dah!!!! That statement shines a light on the problem. While some (perhaps<br/>most) musicians tend to think in terms of a scale of pitches directly<br/>related to the tonic pitch, string players and singers (among others) tend<br/>to think (perhaps intuitively) of tuning in terms of the prevailing harmony.<br/>In other words, the &quot;diatonic scale steps&quot;actually _move_ in relation to the<br/>changing fundamental. Tuning is a dynamic function. The ear provides instant<br/>correction of related pitches as the music proceeds. No need for math. No<br/>need for 43 pitch scales. (Easy folks. I _do_ dig your microtonal<br/>creations.)</p><p>Here&apos;s an example. When a singer is on the tonic pitch in tonic harmony<br/>(C-E-G) and the harmony changes to a V7-of-ii (D-F#-A-C), if the singer<br/>&quot;repeats&quot; the C, it will be slightly lower (4:7 over D) in preparation for<br/>the resolution to B, the third of the G major target chord. Don&apos;t tell me<br/>this is not true. I&apos;ve witnessed it hundreds of times. (Never on a piano,<br/>however.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Hold on there, Mr. K. B-F in the key of C is not 7:10 over a C fundamental;<br/>&gt;&gt;it&apos;s 7:10 over a _G_ fundamental--the dominant of C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If B:F (B up to F) is closer to a 7:10 than a 5:7</p><p>Hooooooooold it! That&apos;s _not_ &quot;closer to 7:10 than 5:7.&quot; You&apos;ve still got it<br/>backwards. Also, it _is_ 5:7; _not_ 7:10. And &quot;closer to&quot; has nothing to do<br/>with it.</p><p>&gt; then that&apos;s true no<br/>&gt; matter what other notes it is over. I assume we&apos;re not talking about<br/>&gt; dynamic retuning</p><p>I can&apos;t speak for you, but I am definitely talking about dynamic tuning<br/>(forget the &quot;re-&quot;). That&apos;s the only tuning I know anything about.</p><p>&gt; and we are both assuming the convention of writing the<br/>&gt; notes of an interval or chord with pitch ascending from left to right.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean by &quot;left to right.&quot; Keyboard left to right?</p><p>&gt; Yes,<br/>&gt; the B:F forms part of the G7 chord and is closer to 7:10 than 5:7 in most<br/>&gt; reasonable diatonic tunings of that chord.</p><p>You still have it backwards.</p><p>&gt; So it seems we agree.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Therefore, when B is<br/>&gt;&gt;the upper member it is the 10 of 7:10, an augmented fourth (F up to B) and<br/>&gt;&gt;goes to C; and when F is the upper member it is 7 of 5:7, a diminished fifth<br/>&gt;&gt;(B up to F) and goes down to E. Therefore, since 7:10 is larger than 5:7,<br/>&gt;&gt;their initial sizes are related to where they will resolve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok. We disagree. Same problem. dominant 7th chord is closer to 4:5:6|5:6<br/>&gt; than 4:5:6:7. 5:6 + 5:6 is closer to 7:10 than 5:7.</p><p>No doubt about that. But why do you buy into the notion that 4:7 is not<br/>usable in diatonic music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course whether B:F is closer to 5:7 or 7:10 depends on your tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Not on _my_ tuning--on &quot;nature&apos;s&quot; tuning (if one accepts the principles of<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;functional harmony&quot;). If you want to resolve them the other way, you<br/>&gt;&gt;certainly can. To me, the resolution of an augmented fourth is predetermined<br/>&gt;&gt;by its &quot;larger&quot; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We don&apos;t disagree on how the notes resolve, or what the intervals are<br/>&gt; called. Our only disagreement is what JI ratio they best approximate. The<br/>&gt; only way you could be right is if the scale was tuned with fifths _wider_<br/>&gt; than 700 cents (on the Pythagorean side of 12-tET, a &quot;negative&quot; meantone).<br/>&gt; And as you probably know, this would give very bad major and minor thirds<br/>&gt; (assuming we&apos;re still trying to be diatonic).</p><p>Don&apos;t forget about what you refer to as &quot;dynamic tuning&quot; and I as &quot;moving<br/>pitches.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Perhaps we could simply agree to disagree on this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps.</p><p>I think we have. As long as you prefer a keyboard-influenced dominant chord,<br/>we have little in common.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It might be<br/>&gt;&gt;considered that during Fokker&apos;s productive years, the principle of tonality<br/>&gt;&gt;was being seriously challenged by Schoenberg and friends. It seems likely<br/>&gt;&gt;that his use of these interval terms were intentionally &quot;nonfunctional.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. Absolutely not. They are perfectly sensible terms for extended meantone<br/>&gt; tunings. Even Paul and Carl agree with that.</p><p>I know nothing of &quot;extended meantone tunings.&quot; I only know what I hear.<br/>(And, as you may have noticed, Paul and Carl have caused me to be very<br/>careful about _that_. LOL)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. The whole system<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;And this is the rub. We&apos;re talking about different musical systems here, as<br/>&gt;&gt;you clearly point out as this paragraph continues...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; would be screwed if we swapped these two. To be fair<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to Mr Fokker, strictly speaking, he gave the names to the intervals of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 31-tET (a meantone), not to the JI ratios which they approximate. The<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; latter seems like an obvious move to many people<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not different systems. One is merely a superset of the other. 31-tET is an<br/>&gt; extended meantone and contains perfectly ordinary diatonic subsets. Their<br/>&gt; Fokker interval names are completely standard and uncontrovertial.</p><p>Does &quot;standard and uncontroversial&quot; for meantone include naked and raw<br/>acoustic tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; But one does need to know (at<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; least) whether the tuning being used has G# &lt; Ab or G# &gt; Ab.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Exactly. To me, there is no question about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So which is it, G# &lt; Ab (meantone) or G# &gt; Ab (Pythagorean)</p><p>Probably, neither.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Show me a tuning of a diatonic scale that has a reasonable approximation to<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7 as its &quot;dominant 7th&quot; (while all the major and minor triads still<br/>&gt; work). It can&apos;t be done. One must simultaneously distribute the syntonic<br/>&gt; comma 80:81 (so 8:9 = 9:10) 21.5c and the huge septimal diesis 35:36 (so<br/>&gt; 6:7 = 5:6) 48.8c.</p><p>It&apos;s called &quot;live performance.&quot; It&apos;s really quite exciting.

The 9:7 and 7:6 are the natural diatonic major and minor<br/>&gt;thirds in this tuning, based on the way they fall in the scale.  The o- and<br/>&gt;-utonal 6:7:9 chords function as 1-3-5 triads exactly like the 4:5:6&apos;s<br/>&gt;function in a meantone diatonic.</p><p>I know what you mean, but for me this is stretching the meaning of &quot;diatonic&quot; beyond the breaking point. As others have said, a 7:9 is a car horn, not a major third. It can _function like_ a diatonic major third but it sure doesn&apos;t _sound like_ one. I want names that stick to how they sound. Like octave and fifth undoubtedly already do (unless one prefaces them with the word &quot;formal&quot; or suchlike). So by all means call an approx 7:9 a &quot;formal major third&quot; in the specific context of playing in a pseudo-diatonic scale in 22-tET.</p><p>Of course, another take on that is:</p><p>Sure a 7:9 can be perceived as a major third (just barely), but 4:5 will be perceived as one too. So what kind of major third is a 7:9? Why it&apos;s a _super_ major-third, since clearly the 4:5 is the standard one we are all used to.</p><p>&gt;Dave, I hope you don&apos;t take me wrong on this issue.  When working with the<br/>&gt;diatonic scale, diatonic names are appropriate.  When working with the<br/>&gt;decatonic scale they are not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For composers working with the diatonic scale and 11-limit chromatic<br/>&gt;harmony, your naming scheme (or something like it) will be essential.<br/>&gt;Inconsistency is just something that composers interested in this setup<br/>&gt;will have to deal with.  By the way, diatonic music with high-limit<br/>&gt;chromatic harmony is one of the most fertile grounds in tuning theory in my<br/>&gt;opinion, and I have plans to explore it in depth one day, when your naming<br/>&gt;scheme will very likely be handy to me.</p><p>OK.

The fact that you can&apos;t remember which is<br/>which verifies it. While the 12-tET tritone is symmetrically invertible, the<br/>acoustics tritones are not. To the contrary, 12-tET tends to promote the<br/>idea that #4 and b5 are essentially the same pitch. They are _not_--<br/>particularly in performance practice of common practice music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;But....but.....but.....but 7:10 fits the partial series (of C) as Bb _up_ to<br/>&gt;&gt;E--an augmented fourth in a dominant seventh chord belonging to the key of<br/>&gt;&gt;F.

I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;&gt;damned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s not what I&apos;m saying at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ratios with odd-factors greater than 5 are irrelevant to diatonic music,<br/>&gt; with the possible exception of ratios of 9. 7&apos;s don&apos;t matter. They are only<br/>&gt; involved in functional _dissonances_.</p><p>ONLY involved with functional dissonance?????????? What do you think pushes<br/>the dynamic forces of functional harmony? It&apos;s the tritone, baby. And<br/>well-tuned tritones do the job better than any piano could ever dream of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a somewhat &quot;religious&quot; issue</p><p>(I think I just illustrated that point with my passionate outburst. :-)</p><p>&gt; but I contend that a dominant 7th<br/>&gt; chord is not (should not be) an approximate 4:5:6:7 chord.</p><p>Why not? What do you have against consonance? Did you _believe_ your theory<br/>teacher when he/she said &quot;The seventh partial is quite unusable in<br/>traditional music&quot;? Wow! What a waste!</p><p>&gt; A 4:5:6:7 is<br/>&gt; much more consonant and should be called a subminor 7th or (German)<br/>&gt; augmented 6th chord.</p><p>I have no trouble with &quot;subminor 7th,&quot; but a 4:5:6:7 has nothing to do with<br/>an augmented sixth chord (spell Ab-C-EborD#-F#). Listen to a good string<br/>quartet play an augmented sixth chord and you will never bring up that<br/>argument again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A dominant seventh chord has a _minor_ third stacked on a major triad (not<br/>&gt; a _subminor_ third).</p><p>You&apos;ve go to be kidding! Why would a pitch sensitive singer/player be<br/>satisfied with a 12-tET seventh when an acoustic one is much more<br/>expressive?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what you say above, is true only if you replace &quot;dominant&quot; with<br/>&gt; &quot;subminor&quot;, but we would no longer be in the realm of diatonic scales.</p><p>Ta-dah!!!! That statement shines a light on the problem. While some (perhaps<br/>most) musicians tend to think in terms of a scale of pitches directly<br/>related to the tonic pitch, string players and singers (among others) tend<br/>to think (perhaps intuitively) of tuning in terms of the prevailing harmony.<br/>In other words, the &quot;diatonic scale steps&quot;actually _move_ in relation to the<br/>changing fundamental. Tuning is a dynamic function. The ear provides instant<br/>correction of related pitches as the music proceeds. No need for math. No<br/>need for 43 pitch scales. (Easy folks. I _do_ dig your microtonal<br/>creations.)</p><p>Here&apos;s an example. When a singer is on the tonic pitch in tonic harmony<br/>(C-E-G) and the harmony changes to a V7-of-ii (D-F#-A-C), if the singer<br/>&quot;repeats&quot; the C, it will be slightly lower (4:7 over D) in preparation for<br/>the resolution to B, the third of the G major target chord. Don&apos;t tell me<br/>this is not true. I&apos;ve witnessed it hundreds of times. (Never on a piano,<br/>however.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Hold on there, Mr. K. B-F in the key of C is not 7:10 over a C fundamental;<br/>&gt;&gt;it&apos;s 7:10 over a _G_ fundamental--the dominant of C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If B:F (B up to F) is closer to a 7:10 than a 5:7</p><p>Hooooooooold it! That&apos;s _not_ &quot;closer to 7:10 than 5:7.&quot; You&apos;ve still got it<br/>backwards. Also, it _is_ 5:7; _not_ 7:10. And &quot;closer to&quot; has nothing to do<br/>with it.</p><p>&gt; then that&apos;s true no<br/>&gt; matter what other notes it is over. I assume we&apos;re not talking about<br/>&gt; dynamic retuning</p><p>I can&apos;t speak for you, but I am definitely talking about dynamic tuning<br/>(forget the &quot;re-&quot;). That&apos;s the only tuning I know anything about.</p><p>&gt; and we are both assuming the convention of writing the<br/>&gt; notes of an interval or chord with pitch ascending from left to right.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean by &quot;left to right.&quot; Keyboard left to right?</p><p>&gt; Yes,<br/>&gt; the B:F forms part of the G7 chord and is closer to 7:10 than 5:7 in most<br/>&gt; reasonable diatonic tunings of that chord.</p><p>You still have it backwards.</p><p>&gt; So it seems we agree.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Therefore, when B is<br/>&gt;&gt;the upper member it is the 10 of 7:10, an augmented fourth (F up to B) and<br/>&gt;&gt;goes to C; and when F is the upper member it is 7 of 5:7, a diminished fifth<br/>&gt;&gt;(B up to F) and goes down to E. Therefore, since 7:10 is larger than 5:7,<br/>&gt;&gt;their initial sizes are related to where they will resolve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok. We disagree. Same problem. dominant 7th chord is closer to 4:5:6|5:6<br/>&gt; than 4:5:6:7. 5:6 + 5:6 is closer to 7:10 than 5:7.</p><p>No doubt about that. But why do you buy into the notion that 4:7 is not<br/>usable in diatonic music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course whether B:F is closer to 5:7 or 7:10 depends on your tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Not on _my_ tuning--on &quot;nature&apos;s&quot; tuning (if one accepts the principles of<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;functional harmony&quot;). If you want to resolve them the other way, you<br/>&gt;&gt;certainly can. To me, the resolution of an augmented fourth is predetermined<br/>&gt;&gt;by its &quot;larger&quot; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We don&apos;t disagree on how the notes resolve, or what the intervals are<br/>&gt; called. Our only disagreement is what JI ratio they best approximate. The<br/>&gt; only way you could be right is if the scale was tuned with fifths _wider_<br/>&gt; than 700 cents (on the Pythagorean side of 12-tET, a &quot;negative&quot; meantone).<br/>&gt; And as you probably know, this would give very bad major and minor thirds<br/>&gt; (assuming we&apos;re still trying to be diatonic).</p><p>Don&apos;t forget about what you refer to as &quot;dynamic tuning&quot; and I as &quot;moving<br/>pitches.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Perhaps we could simply agree to disagree on this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps.</p><p>I think we have. As long as you prefer a keyboard-influenced dominant chord,<br/>we have little in common.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;It might be<br/>&gt;&gt;considered that during Fokker&apos;s productive years, the principle of tonality<br/>&gt;&gt;was being seriously challenged by Schoenberg and friends. It seems likely<br/>&gt;&gt;that his use of these interval terms were intentionally &quot;nonfunctional.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. Absolutely not. They are perfectly sensible terms for extended meantone<br/>&gt; tunings. Even Paul and Carl agree with that.</p><p>I know nothing of &quot;extended meantone tunings.&quot; I only know what I hear.<br/>(And, as you may have noticed, Paul and Carl have caused me to be very<br/>careful about _that_. LOL)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. The whole system<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;And this is the rub. We&apos;re talking about different musical systems here, as<br/>&gt;&gt;you clearly point out as this paragraph continues...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; would be screwed if we swapped these two. To be fair<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to Mr Fokker, strictly speaking, he gave the names to the intervals of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 31-tET (a meantone), not to the JI ratios which they approximate. The<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; latter seems like an obvious move to many people<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not different systems. One is merely a superset of the other. 31-tET is an<br/>&gt; extended meantone and contains perfectly ordinary diatonic subsets. Their<br/>&gt; Fokker interval names are completely standard and uncontrovertial.</p><p>Does &quot;standard and uncontroversial&quot; for meantone include naked and raw<br/>acoustic tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; But one does need to know (at<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; least) whether the tuning being used has G# &lt; Ab or G# &gt; Ab.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Exactly. To me, there is no question about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So which is it, G# &lt; Ab (meantone) or G# &gt; Ab (Pythagorean)</p><p>Probably, neither.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Show me a tuning of a diatonic scale that has a reasonable approximation to<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7 as its &quot;dominant 7th&quot; (while all the major and minor triads still<br/>&gt; work). It can&apos;t be done. One must simultaneously distribute the syntonic<br/>&gt; comma 80:81 (so 8:9 = 9:10) 21.5c and the huge septimal diesis 35:36 (so<br/>&gt; 6:7 = 5:6) 48.8c.</p><p>It&apos;s called &quot;live performance.&quot; It&apos;s really quite exciting. Join a good<br/>choir or play in a fine string group. Ears and nature get along very well<br/>when left to themselves.</p><p>Our &quot;differences&quot; are clearly due to our different experience with music.<br/>Neither is &quot;better&quot; than the other. They are simply different. I am learning<br/>an enormous amount of valuable information by participating on the List.
