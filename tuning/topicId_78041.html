The tunings in Burma would be a better measure of what the tuning in this region would be.<br/>I have also seen it described by one leading ethnomusicologist that the panpipes in the Solomon Islands are tuned to 7 ET. the measurements do not even provide 7 tones in the octave, much less equal. Measurements often are political tools.</p><p>Hugh Tracy&apos;s book on the Chopi points out that the village of Mavila was the best tuning even if they said it was 7 ET. it is further from it than others. Even though they refer to it being &apos;equal&apos; this term means something different to them.</p><p>Unless a culture modulated what would be the point of an ET, unless we are going to assume that people like ET even if in one key.<br/>If one has limited resources on an instrument, having each mode distinct makes more differet type of music possible.

I do like 7 ET myself, although I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d<br/>gravitate towards that for music that doesn&apos;t modulate.</p><p>One thing I notice is if a singer jumps from C-E, she&apos;ll probably sing<br/>that pretty close to a 5/4 major third. But, if she goes from C-D and<br/>then from D-E, she might end up closer to 81/64 than 5/4. I think it&apos;s<br/>just because singers usually have in mind a list of different<br/>intervals - a major third, a whole step, etc... And the one they&apos;ll<br/>pick out for the whole step is usually around 9/8, and the one they<br/>pick out for the major third is usually 5/4. If they go from C-D and<br/>then from D-E, they move up two whole steps. I don&apos;t often hear 9/8<br/>tempered flat to accomodate 5/4 or 5/4 tempered sharp to accomodate<br/>9/8, except the latter in certain cases, such as when two whole steps<br/>are sung in a row (which isn&apos;t really a tempering at all).</p></div>
