Monz found 19/16 used as a blue note. But the<br/>&gt; general definition in practically all the literature<br/>&gt; (I don&apos;t know any exceptions) speaks about neutral thirds<br/>&gt; and sevenths. Guitarists play it like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve asked before and do it again: Who brought up the<br/>&gt; notion that blue notes are septimal intervals, or are<br/>&gt; extra low thirds?</p><p>I&apos;m certain that the idea that blue notes are septimal<br/>ratios comes from the fact that in the blues, *every*<br/>chord is a dominant-7th chord.</p><p>This is fundamentally different from Euro-style<br/>&quot;common-practice&quot; usage, where the dominant-7th chord<br/>is a dissonance which must be resolved, and typically<br/>only appears as the &quot;dominant&quot; (V), with the root of<br/>the chord on the 5th degree of the diatonic scale ...<br/>or it functions exactly like that in cases where a<br/>different chord has chromatic substitutions.</p><p>In blues this is not the case. *Every* chord is a<br/>dominant-7th chord, and none of them set up the kind<br/>of tension--&gt;resolution expectation as they do in<br/>Euro-style music.</p><p>Thus, in blues the dominant-7th chord is the funadamental<br/>consonance. This IMO encourages the listener&apos;s ears to<br/>interpret *every* chord as a 4:5:6:7 proportion.</p><p>So let&apos;s say we have a vocalist or guitarist jamming<br/>away on the A C D E G pentatonic scale with pitch-bends.<br/>The chords which go with that scale in the blues<br/>typically follow the 12-measure progression:<br/>A7 / / / D7 / A7 / E7 D7 A7 E7.</p><p>If the listener&apos;s ear is already hearing the melodic G<br/>as a 7/4 above A, the melodic C as a 7/4 above D, and<br/>the melodic D as a 7/4 above E, and with all the bending<br/>going on, the guitarist and vocalist may indeed be<br/>*playing* those notes lower in pitch so that they<br/>really *are* septimal intervals.</p><p>If the D is approximately a 4/3 above the tonic A, and<br/>the C is approximately a 7/4 above the D, then when the<br/>A7 comes back around, that C will be heard as a 7/6.</p><p>So that&apos;s my theory on why theorists persist in claiming<br/>that septimal intervals are important to the blues.</p><p>Of course the real situation is much more complicated<br/>than that. Old-school (i.e., Delta) blues musicians<br/>didn&apos;t know anything about Western music-theory, and<br/>played and sang whatever damn notes they felt. For an<br/>example of the richness of notes available to them, see:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a></p><p>The tonic of this piece is D. The scale Johnson used<br/>in his vocals in this song is interesting in that,<br/>if you try to describe it in terms of 12-edo or meantone,<br/>you basically get: D F# G G#/Ab A A#/Bb B C C#.<br/>So it&apos;s essentially a chromatic scale, but with a<br/>big gap between the D and F#. But it could still,<br/>with less accuracy, be notated and performed simply<br/>with D F G A C, and it wouldn&apos;t really sound &quot;wrong&quot;.</p><p>And keep in mind that this tune is one of Robert Johnson&apos;s<br/>*simplest* performances.

If you want to wait for Paul&apos;s reply<br/>&gt;&gt;to reply, that&apos;s fine by me.  I&apos;m just thinking aloud waiting<br/>&gt;&gt;for Paul&apos;s reply myself.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m not sure why you&apos;re subtracting these beat rates here.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sorry if I&apos;m behind, but . . . subtracting beat rates? It seems Yahya &gt;is merely calculating beat rates here (and correctly, I might add), &gt;not subtracting any.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;As I think Paul was trying to say, beats are amplitude<br/>&gt;&gt;modulation, which is sort of a second order sound wave.<br/>&gt;&gt;They represent changes in the amplitude of a sound,<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;a pitch<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;not<br/>&gt;&gt;a sound<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;a pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;in and of themselves.  AM is used for synthesis<br/>&gt;&gt;and can create new pitches, called sidebands, but they<br/>&gt;&gt;aren&apos;t at the frequency of the beats.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They&apos;re at the frequency of the original sine waves in Yahya&apos;s &gt;example, if what you&apos;re modulating is a sine wave whose frequency is &gt;the average of the two. You&apos;ve just turned the equivalence of beating &gt;with AM around, and applied it backwards, which is of course &gt;perfectly valid to do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Perhaps sidebands<br/>&gt;&gt;could be evoked from beating in an acoustic musical<br/>&gt;&gt;instrument,<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think you&apos;ve gotten a bit confused. The sidebands &quot;created&quot; by the &gt;AM applied to the heard frequency would be identical to the original &gt;frequencies in the musical instrument; the AM itself would be &gt;identical to the beating heard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 25        &gt;   Date: Mon, 17 Oct 2005 20:52:34 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Beats (was No doubt about Lehman&apos;s Bach scale)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;When ANY two frequencies sound simultaneously, so do two<br/>&gt;&gt;other frequencies - their sum and difference.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yahya, this is not true in general. It&apos;s not true when the sound is &gt;amplified or reproduced *linearly*, i.e., with no distortion. &gt;Meanwhile, when there is a quadratic distortion of the signal, you &gt;get not only the sum and difference, but also the 2nd partials of &gt;each of the two frequencies. Shall I show the math?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;As I think Paul was trying to say, beats are amplitude<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;modulation, which is sort of a second order sound wave.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Combining two pure sinusoidal waves of frequencies A and B<br/>&gt;&gt;results in sinusoidal waves with components of frequencies<br/>&gt;&gt;A-B and A+B. &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is false, in general, as I wrote above. It&apos;s only true in the &gt;presence of distortion. A quadratic nonlinearity is the simplest kind &gt;of distortion, and results in not only A, B, A-B, and A+B, but also &gt;2*A and 2*B as well. Perhaps I should review the math?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;If the upper and lower sidebands aren&apos;t at the &gt;&gt;frequencies of the combination tones, what frequencies &gt;&gt;are they at?<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They are at the frequencies corresponding to A and B in your example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt;of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;Yahoo!
