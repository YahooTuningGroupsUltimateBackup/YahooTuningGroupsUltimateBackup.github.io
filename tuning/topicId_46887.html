Maybe you<br/>can help us settle on standard sets. Can you tell us what you intend<br/>to use them for. This may affect the choice of symbols.</p><p>In both 612-tET and 665-tET we would need to use 5-schisma accent<br/>marks placed immediately to the left of shafted symbols, to raise or<br/>lower their pitch by a schisma. These are similar in appearance to<br/>acute (up) and grave (down) accents in text.</p><p>1/612th octave is essentially an eleventh of a 5-comma (syntonic or<br/>Dydimus), or a twelfth of a 3-comma (Pythagorean), or a 5-schisma<br/>(plain old schisma), as you say. 1/665th of an octave is essentially a<br/>twelfth of a syntonic comma. And 665-tET has exactly 3 times as many<br/>divisions per apotome (sharp or flat) as 217-ET which is essentially<br/>quarter-5-commas.</p><p>Unfortunately we shouldn&apos;t simply make the 217-tET symbols stand for<br/>every third step of 665-tET and then add schisma-up and schisma-down<br/>accented versions on either side of these, because the increased<br/>resolution of 665-tET means that in a few cases these degrees are no<br/>longer the best approximation to the same ratio as they were in<br/>217-tET. And it is the ratio approximations that are the constant<br/>meanings of the symbols across all tunings, just as a sharp or flat<br/>has the constant meaning of representing a chain of 7 approximate 2:3s<br/>in all tunings.</p><p>It is however possible to find an unaccented symbol that is valid in<br/>its primary comma role for all multiples of 3 degrees of 665-tET, if<br/>this is important. And most of them _are_ the same as the<br/>corresponding 217-tET symbol.

Yes you can<br/>use standard sharps, flats and their doubles for apotomes.

The rest is<br/>only slightly different to what you suggested. You would use 12<br/>distinct arrow-like symbols (and their inversions) for the<br/>quarter-syntonic-commas and add schisma up and down symbols (which<br/>look like miniature versions of the comma slash symbols) to those, to<br/>fill in the gaps.</p><p>&gt; Not if you change the maximum scale size in params.par file. I<br/>successfully<br/>&gt; generated a 4296-tet scale once!</p><p>OK! Thanks for that tip. By the way, the biggest ET notatable with<br/>sagittal is 1171. So we have essentially one cent resolution relative<br/>to Pythagorean. It&apos;s funny to think that if you had a piano tuned to<br/>consecutive steps of 1171-tET and started with C at the low end, you<br/>still wouldn&apos;t have reached C# by the time you got to the high end. On<br/>an 88-keyer you&apos;d be one step short of Db (in Pythagorean terms).</p><p>But I recently met a woman who teaches music in Germany, who had in<br/>her office for some time, a specially made 97-key acoustic piano with<br/>consecutive steps of 96-ET on it. I had to tell her that 72-tET would<br/>have been better value for money since it has better JI<br/>approximations, and I was able to demonstrate that for her on my<br/>laptop using Scala. She was very interested in the just thirds and<br/>sixths, but I think she found the ratios of 7 a bit freaky. :-)</p><p>I mentioned resolution relative to Pythagorean. I should mention that<br/>we&apos;ve also catered for folks who want to notate everything relative to<br/>12-tET-sized fifths (In Scala, SET NOTATION SA12R) although we<br/>recommend doing this only for scales that actually _have_ some<br/>12-tET-sized fifths. It gives mutually-consistent notations for all<br/>multiples of 12-ET up to 192-ET (excluding 180-ET). This notation<br/>_only_ :-) has a resolution of about 6 cents (i.e. max errors of about<br/>+-3 cents). However this could be extended to 2 cent resolution, by<br/>using the schisma symbols in a false manner to mean 2 cents. I say<br/>&quot;false&quot; because from the ratio-approximation point-of-view the<br/>5-schisma is actually negative relative to 12-ET-sized fifths.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The sagittal system of symbols has something in common with chinese<br/>&gt; &gt; characters. Each sagittal symbol is a different combination of a few<br/>&gt; &gt; common strokes, where the strokes themselves look as different as<br/>&gt; &gt; possible from one another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m thinking the rebus principle myself! Korean does that with Hangul<br/>&gt; phonetic script; consonant and vowel symbols are arranged in a<br/>square-shaped<br/>&gt; cell for each syllable; each cell may contain anywhere from two to five<br/>&gt; distinct symbols.</p><p>All right! I&apos;d never heard of the Rebus principle before. A quick<br/>Google search has furthered my education in this regard, thanks. It<br/>makes so much sense!<br/><a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/chinese/aspect/rebus.html">http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/chinese/aspect/rebus.html</a></p><p>Here&apos;s my summary of the Rebus Principle:<br/>Written symbols which initially represent meanings directly (e.g. via<br/>simple pictures) are subsequently borrowed to represent new words that<br/>have the same _sounds_, regardless of the meaning. This occurs because<br/>if you have to make a new symbol for every new _meaning_, you will<br/>soon run out of distinguishable symbols, whereas there are far fewer<br/>_sounds_ to be represented.</p><p>However it isn&apos;t totally clear to me how this relates to notating<br/>pitch, since, in this case, the sound _is_ the meaning. Ah but which<br/>aspect of the sound is to be _meant_ by a symbol, the size of the<br/>melodic step, or the sonority of the harmony? We have chosen to favour<br/>harmony since experiments have shown that small errors in pitch have a<br/>much greater effect on perception of harmony than melody. But we have<br/>not ignored melody either, since whenever possible, we ensure that<br/>symbols do not represent widely different melodic distances in<br/>different tunings.</p><p>So in this case we could say that different ratios which are very<br/>close together constitute different meanings for the same sound. And<br/>we do indeed use the same symbol to represent nearby ratios other than<br/>the one that is represented directly in the strokes making up the<br/>symbol, and just as with natural languages, sometimes the original<br/>direct ratio meaning of the symbol is completely squeezed out because<br/>the other ratios are far more common.  And, just like the chinese who<br/>then add &quot;semantic radicals&quot; to distinguish the meaning of same-sound<br/>words, we then allow those who feel the need, to add schisma accent<br/>marks (or sometimes whole new symbols) to distinguish these ratios.</p><p>I find this parallel with the evolution of natural languages to be<br/>uncanny. But instead of taking hundred or thousands of years, this<br/>evolution took place over about 18 months! If you have the patience to<br/>go thru the archives of tuning-math in the &quot;Common notation for JI and<br/>ETs&quot; thread, you can see it happening.
