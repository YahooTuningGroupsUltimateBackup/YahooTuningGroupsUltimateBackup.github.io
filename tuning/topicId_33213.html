I *would* suggest<br/>that when a window pops up that it is handy to have a &quot;close window&quot;<br/>button in it, but your site design doesn&apos;t look like it would work<br/>too well: you have static pages that you call from links and no way<br/>to insert the buttons... but I&apos;ll think about it while I&apos;m on my<br/>trip, because there is almost *always* a way to do something.</p><p>And someday you might want to set aside some time from writing<br/>definitions and consider a frame-based design.
