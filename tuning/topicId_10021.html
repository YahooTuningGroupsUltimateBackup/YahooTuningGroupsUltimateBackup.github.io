Go to <a href="http://www.myplay.com">www.myplay.com</a> and join. It costs nothing and it is easy.<br/>Then upload your mp3 files to their server, make a playlist from them<br/>(must be at least 5 hours long), and publish it. There. You are done. You<br/>have a microtonal radio show. I will let you know when mine is done.<br/>Download dropbox from the main page and you can upload batches.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
