I think on<br/>a page like this it is totally appropriate to post not only new music, but<br/>retunings of public domain music as well as examples of tunings, scales,<br/>chord progressions and any other educational material. I am in agreement<br/>with Kraig on reworking of the material of others here, and ask that any<br/>performance that does not conform to the instructions of the composer be<br/>labelled as such, for instance, &quot;Batman Theme, retuned to 65 limit scale&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;Batman Theme&quot;, and that we be extremely careful in submitting<br/>works by composers like Partch who have gone out of their way to make<br/>clear their performance preferences. That said, have fun.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/1999 11:04:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; I have set up a page on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> for The Tuning Punks.

In addition, <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> requires<br/>the .mp3 file be in a strict format, which, luckily, is the default format<br/>on most mp3 recorders (128 kbps, 44.1 mHz, stereo). It can take up to<br/>four days for <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> to approve of any submission (they censor racist<br/>and vulgar language, bad encoding and copyright infringement) and up to 2<br/>days for me to post any submissions. The Tuning Punks are in the<br/>world/folk world fusion section, but the best way to go is to search for<br/>The Tuning Punks at <a href="http://www.mp3.com">www.mp3.com</a>. As of this post the site is not<br/>activated, but I will keep you informed.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>Rosati &#x3C;dante@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/1999 11:36:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>-&gt;From: Rick McGowan &lt;<a href="mailto:rmcgowan@apple.com">rmcgowan@apple.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does anyone out there know where I could get any share-ware or free-ware<br/>&gt;that can produce mp3 files from &quot;.WAV&quot; files on Windows95/98 or NT?

(or maybe under Alternative? take a look at the catagories and<br/>subcatagories at <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> and see where you think it could go) I mentioned<br/>Prent Rodgers page and Johns new &quot;Tuning Punks&quot; page as others that would<br/>potentially fit in this catagory.

It can be played by either a WaveBlaster or AWE64 with<br/>sufficient RAM.  Unfortunately, I have neither of these to hand.  If<br/>anybody would like to record the MP3 for me I can send the MIDI file and,<br/>if necessary, SoundFont.</p><p>It has to be one of these synthesizers, because it depends critically on<br/>the patches and effects.  Although, if anybody wants to produce their own<br/>version, I&apos;ll happily submit the MIDI file for that as well.  It may even<br/>be a candidate for adaptive tuning.</p><p>Oh, and as</p><p>&gt;they censor racist<br/>&gt;and vulgar language, bad encoding and copyright infringement</p><p>the title would have to be changed, but that&apos;s okay.</p><p>If there&apos;s going to be a &quot;microtonal&quot; category let it not be under<br/>classical.
