However, I can possibly offer a &quot;semi-educated<br/>guess&quot; as to how such a keyboard _might_ be arranged.</p><p>As I understand it, Salinas described a form of meantone with<br/>1/3-comma of temperament -- that is, the narrowing of each regular<br/>fifth by 1/3 of an 81:80 (~21.51 cents) syntonic comma, producing pure<br/>6:5 minor thirds. In this tuning, regular major thirds as well as<br/>fifths are narrower than a just 5:4 and 3:2 respectively by this<br/>factor of 1/3-comma or ~7.17 cents.</p><p>I&apos;ve read that Salinas himself expressed mixed feelings about this<br/>drastic a temperament in his treatise describing it (1571 as I<br/>recall), and indeed 1/3-comma seems about the historical limit of<br/>meantone in the narrow direction.</p><p>However, this 1/3-comma tuning is almost identical to 19-tone equal<br/>temperament (19-tet), and around the same epoch, French composer and<br/>theorist Guillaume Costeley advocated 19-tet and used it in a<br/>spiritual chanson.</p><p>While 5-limit just intonation (with alternating 9:8 and 10:9<br/>whole-tones) was often taken as the &quot;natural&quot; tuning for voices in<br/>this period, I&apos;ve not aware of any proposal to implement such a scheme<br/>on keyboard. Rather, as Paul Erlich has rightly emphasized, meantone<br/>was the assumed standard, and the basis for various keyboards (in<br/>practice and theory) with more than 12 notes per octave.</p><p>Thus as Erlich himself aptly adds to underscore this point, Zarlino<br/>himself favored a 2/7-comma meantone scheme for keyboards, which in<br/>modern terms might be said to &quot;distribute the error&quot; rather equitably<br/>between major thirds (pure at 1/4-comma) and minor thirds (pure at 1/3<br/>comma). Mark Lindley has suggested that Zarlino&apos;s tuning might give a<br/>special character to pieces with prominent minor thirds.</p><p>A 19-tone keyboard might use a wide range of meantone temperaments,<br/>with the special advantage of 19-tet being that it makes possible a<br/>neatly closed system. How important such a &quot;closure&quot; property is for<br/>even much &quot;wildly experimental&quot; Renaissance music seems unclear to me.</p><p>Maybe a diagram might make this &quot;closure&quot; property clearer. In any<br/>characteristic meantone tuning, the diatonic semitone is the _large_<br/>semitone (e.g. c#-d), and the chromatic semitone the _small_ semitone<br/>(e.g. c-c#). In 19-tet, more specifically, each diatonic semitone is<br/>2/3-tone, and each chromatic semitone 1/3-tone:</p><p>                    fb                                 cb&apos;<br/>  c# db   d#  eb    e#    f#  gb   g#  ab   a#  bb     b#<br/>c       d        e      f        g        a         b      c&apos;</p><p>Since the effect of a sharp is to raise a note by 1/3-tone (a<br/>chromatic semitone), and the effect of a flat is to lower it by the<br/>same amount, either e# or fb precisely bisects the 2/3-tone interval<br/>e-f, and likewise cb&apos;/b# bisects b-c&apos;. In each case, these pairs of<br/>identical tones can be represented by a single key, and the circle<br/>closes on itself.</p><p>It would also be very possible to map the same 19-tone keyboard in<br/>Nicola Vicentino&apos;s 31-tet (almost identical to 1/4-comma tuning with<br/>pure 5:4 major thirds), and indeed the first 19 notes of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>_archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; are tuned in just this way. Note<br/>that this tuning has diatonic semitones of 3/5-tone, and chromatic<br/>semitones of 2/5 tone, so that the pairs E#/Fb and B#/Cb remain<br/>distinct notes, with room left for the other basic 12 notes of the<br/>31-tet scheme (a @ shows a note raised by Vicentino&apos;s &quot;diesis&quot; or<br/>1/5-tone):</p><p>       db@      eb@               gb@       ab@       bb@<br/> c@       d@         e@     f@        g@        a@         b@<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   c# db    d# eb      e#     f# gb     g# ab     a# bb        b#<br/>c        d         e       f         g         a          b        c&apos;</p><p>Here e@ (1/5-tone up from e) might also be written as fb (2/5-tone<br/>down from f), and likewise b@ as cb.</p><p>(If I&apos;m correct, a curious property of 31-tet is that e# is _higher_<br/>than fb, and b# higher than cb, contrary to the usual meantone pattern<br/>of the first 19 notes that c# is _lower_ than db, etc.)</p><p>It may be noted that neither in a &quot;Salinas/Costeley 19&quot; keyboard<br/>(19-tet), nor in a &quot;Vicentino 19 out of 31&quot; keyboard, do we have<br/>intervals smaller than the diesis of 1/3-tone or 1/5-tone<br/>respectively. This diesis represents the difference between c# and db,<br/>for example, and between a regular major third (e.g. d-f#) and a<br/>diminished fourth (e.g. d-gb).</p><p>However, Vicentino _does_ propose a 31-tet keyboard with 36 or 38<br/>actual notes per octave in order to include a few &quot;comma keys&quot;<br/>permitting alternative intonations for certain frequently used<br/>sonorities. While the term &quot;comma&quot; can apparently mean various kinds<br/>of small intervals in this treatise, one attractive interpretation is<br/>that these keys might actually be raised by about _1/4 syntonic comma_<br/>(~5.38 cents) in order to permit sonorities like d-f#-a with just 3:2<br/>fifths. Or, if one presumes precise 31-tet, they would be raised by<br/>~5.18 cents, with major thirds actually a tidge wider than 5:4,<br/>etc. -- but &quot;virtually&quot; just intonation, in any case.</p><p>Yet more interestingly, in an Aristoxenian (or Erlichian?) fashion,<br/>Vicentino proposes that his 31-tet keyboard be taken as a standard for<br/>singers in judging and perfecting intervals. Maybe the recent Tuning<br/>List topic of &quot;Adaptive JI&quot; might be as good a name as any for this<br/>kind of approach.</p><p>In short, either a Salinas/Costeley 1/3-comma or 19-tet scheme, or a<br/>Vicentino 1/4-comma or 31-tet scheme, might be implemented on a<br/>19-tone instrument. In the former case, we have a closed tuning; in<br/>the latter, we have in effect &quot;19 out of 31.&quot;</p><p>To borrow Vicentino&apos;s terms, a 19-tone keyboard under either scheme<br/>implements the diatonic and chromatic genera. With 19-tet, this is a<br/>complete and closed system; with 31-tet, it remains open, leaving room<br/>for the additional 12 notes of Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic genus.</p><p>Another way of stating this is that with 19-tet, each whole-tone of<br/>the diatonic scale is divided into three parts, and each diatonic<br/>semitone (2/3-tone) into two parts, for (5*3 + 2*2) or 19 steps. In<br/>31-tet, each diatonic whole-tone is divided into five parts, and each<br/>diatonic semitone (3/5-tone) into three parts, for (5*5 + 2*3) or 31<br/>steps.</p><p>With a keyboard limited to 19 steps, the 19-tet scheme has the<br/>advantage of closure, but also has more highly tempered fifths, and<br/>yields pure or virtually pure minor thirds while somewhat compromising<br/>the often more important major third.</p><p>In comparison, the &quot;19 out of 31&quot; scheme yields less tempered fifths,<br/>plus pure major thirds. As long as the music remains within the range<br/>of gb-b#, this tuning provides all the notes we actually need.<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s very daring madrigal repertory, for example, includes<br/>according to Glenn Watkins only a single note -- an instance of cb --<br/>outside this range.</p><p>To conclude, I would guess that a 19-tone keyboard from around the<br/>late 16th or early 17th century would likely be tuned in some variety<br/>of meantone in a range conveniently expressed as gb-b# (with eb-g#<br/>being the usual subset of this range found on a 12-note keyboard).</p><p>While a closed 19-tet or open &quot;19 out of 31&quot; scheme are two obvious<br/>possibilities actually described in the period for such keyboards,<br/>one might also choose, for example, Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma tuning. Also,<br/>Mark Lindley has suggested that some musicians of the time may have<br/>favored meantones of a bit less than 1/4-comma, with smoother fifths,<br/>a 1/5-comma tuning being one possibility.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
