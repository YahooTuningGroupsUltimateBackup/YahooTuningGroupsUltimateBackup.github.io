People are, I guess, afraid that Yahoo<br/>will go down?  There could also be a change of administration at<br/>Columbia.  Look at the Mills list.  That changed because of a change<br/>in administration and it&apos;s been *very* difficult to reconstruct the<br/>archives of that list.</p><p>In fact, until now, I haven&apos;t seen more than a handful of them.<br/>Robert Walker has been working on it but, quite frankly, what<br/>happened at Mills was *at least* as bad as anything Yahoo could do to<br/>us!</p><p>So, basically, the idea, as I understand it, of a move was to try to<br/>find an AD FREE WEB INTERFACE.  The e-mail functions are entirely the<br/>same!</p><p>So, unless somebody finds a site we can use with an ad free Web<br/>Interface, what is the point of the move?</p><p>Logically, it doesn&apos;t make any sense.</p><p>If you disagree, what is the logic?
