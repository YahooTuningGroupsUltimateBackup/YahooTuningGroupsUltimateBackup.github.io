But I&apos;ve asked a few people about this and noone seemed capable of giving me the answer. As there are some skilled mathematicians here, I&apos;m hoping that maybe here someone might be able to tell me what I should do with this.</p><p>I have the following pair of equations:</p><p>x^3 - 3*x*y^2 + 1/2 = 0</p><p>y^3 - 3*x^2*y + sqrt(3/4) = 0</p><p>And now I&apos;m getting stuck on the silly fact that I have no idea what the necessary steps are for finding the values of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (I mean, real numbers, not complex ones). Seems like some cubic equations but I don&apos;t know what to do when they&apos;re actually two of them.</p><p>Any suggestion is much appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2012 5:05:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; x^3 - 3*x*y^2 + 1/2 = 0<br/>&gt; y^3 - 3*x^2*y + sqrt(3/4) = 0</p><p>I don&apos;t know a nice method but can do it by searching and refining - there may be a solution near x=0.17364817767, y=-0.98480775301, is that any good?</p><p>Steve M.</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2012 6:06:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, April 15, 2012 2:05 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: A mathematical issue -- finding planar coordinates</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&iuml;&iquest;&half;T&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; x^3 - 3*x*y^2 + 1/2 = 0<br/>&gt; y^3 - 3*x^2*y + sqrt(3/4) = 0</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know a nice method but can do it by searching and refining - there &gt; may be a solution near<br/>&gt; x=0.17364817767, y=-0.98480775301, is that any good?</p><p>Thanks, Steve.
