No kidding! I wrote KG offlist to see what I could<br/>do, but this is another example of the intolerance of this list that<br/>has in the past, and continues, to drive out some of the alternate<br/>opinions, choices, and modes of operation that *any* good community<br/>needs for variety and vitality.</p><p>If it were all as good as when it gets good, like the dialogue<br/>between Joe and George Secor, or any dialogue between Margo Schulter<br/>and the rest of humanity! But certain mindsets just can&apos;t fathom a<br/>correspondent wanting to do something differently, or at least<br/>treating them with some kind of respect. It really is a shame.</p><p>Maybe metatuning is the place to discuss it, but I&apos;ve just about<br/>given up on hope for this group. Doesn&apos;t seem like there are<br/>any &quot;beginners&quot; out there, and the lurkers are staying quiet.
