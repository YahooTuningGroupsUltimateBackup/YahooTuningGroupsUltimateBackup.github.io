That can be extended so that the zeros of the Riemann Zeta funcion show the oscillations, but that doesn&apos;t help much in practice.</p></div><h3><a id=35378 href="#35378">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2002 8:55:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: kalleaho &lt;<a href="mailto:kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi">kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 07, 2002 3:04 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Patterns in Primes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Prime numbers from 5 upward are of form 6n+1 or 6n-1.

Hence there are infinitely many primes of the form 6*n+1 and 6*n-1. It&apos;s been conjectured that this extends to sets of higher degree polynomials (Bateman-Horn conjecture) and if you check n^2 + n + 41 you find its ability to produce primes is remarkable. This is, believe it or not, related to the fact that exp(pi sqrt(163)) is very nearly an integer.</p><p>By plotting the primes on spirals in 2D you can get lines which look a little like the lines on the temperament graphs.</p></div>
