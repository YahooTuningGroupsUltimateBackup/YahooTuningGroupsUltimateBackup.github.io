I put the ratios in the other GSTQ thread. There is a<br/>G(10/9), and a G(9/8) played on the G# key. No septimal Bb though.</p><p>I must make one correction: it seems I got the direction of my<br/>supposedly &apos;septimal&apos; C# wrong. I must have tuned it as 17/12 above<br/>G=(10/9) instead, i.e. 85/54. As the bass of a dim7 it doesn&apos;t have<br/>anything to particularly recommend it.</p><p>If it had been 17/12 *below* G=(10/9), i.e. 40/51, then C#-G-Bb would<br/>at least be 1/(10:12:17). But one shouldn&apos;t expect dim7s with a<br/>5-limit framework to be consonant anyway.</p><p>Strict 5-limit JI with a limited number of keys seems only to start<br/>getting weird or unwelcome sounding when one has mild passing<br/>dissonances that &apos;ought&apos; to be reasonably in tune with other sounding<br/>tones, but actually involve wolves. E.g. if I wanted to play<br/>bb&apos;-c&apos;&apos;-d&apos;&apos; above a chord f-d&apos;-g&apos;. Homophonic chord sequences are much<br/>easier...<br/>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;William Gard&quot; &lt;billygard@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Was the harpsichord itself JI tuned?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I did notice was that you played a line out of tune, then<br/>caught yourself and<br/>&gt; replayed it in tune, as if you had played the 7th of the chord with<br/>the regular Bb, then<br/>&gt; replayed it with an alternate Bb tuned in septimal.
