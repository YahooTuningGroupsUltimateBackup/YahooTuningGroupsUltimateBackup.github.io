Ok. Why first tetrad (3 1 5<br/>&gt;13) is not in list of 34 tetrads ?</p><p>And you wrote :</p><p>&lt;&lt; It is not a local minimum.

It seems to me an artefact. Because (3 1 5 13)<br/>chord is on long descending slope of &quot;total discordance&quot;, it is not weakly<br/>deformed but eliminated. It falls in (9 3 15 5) chord. Tone 13/12 is masked<br/>by 10/9 tone. I tend to consider this distance quite large.</p><p>What do you think about that ?</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div>
