Kraig has an AMAZING rhythmic world, for which I have<br/>the most humble respect. As one might imagine, when you compose in<br/>polymeters, it takes a special kind of writing to make all of the<br/>interlocking meters of various percussion and harmonic/melodic<br/>timbres maintain clear delineation as they evolve over time (in this<br/>regard, Kraig has really &quot;got it going on&quot;!) . I&apos;m currently<br/>interested in composing with a number of simultaneous strata of prime<br/>meters in which all of the timbral elements are passed from one prime<br/>level to another during the course of a composition - and of course<br/>all in JI. I will certainly be making some of this music available on<br/>the Punks page.</p><p>Good evening,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
