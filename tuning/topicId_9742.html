But I bet if you look around on<br/>Onelist that you&apos;ll be able to find a bunch of guitar or tab egroups<br/>more along the lines of what your interested in.</p><p>good luck,<br/>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=9744 href="#9744">ðŸ”—</a>Cornell Family Member &#x3C;corfam@valstar.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2000 8:11:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Reply to Bill:</p><p>I am also new to this group.  I have just been lurking up until now.<br/>This is indeed a strange group. But, I am starting to get an idea of<br/>what it is all about.<br/>I am replying to you partly because I am a Stones fan from way back.<br/>19th Nervous Breakdown is such a cool song.  I know I have figured most<br/>of it out at one time or another.  It may take me awhile to figure it<br/>again and write it in tablature. If I can find time I will go back to<br/>&quot;Out of their Heads&quot; and see if I can do it.<br/>There are also some good web sites for Stones tabs if you run a search<br/>under &quot;Rolling Stones tabs&quot;.<br/>There is also a guitar tuning known as the Keith Richards tuning.  What<br/>you do is take off the lower E string and tune the rest, from low to<br/>high, to GDGBD.<br/>I&apos;m not that sure that &quot;19th&quot; was recorded that way or not.</p><p>Good Luck<br/>Chris Cornell</p><p>Bill Bau wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds like this group is over my head but maybe someone can help<br/>&gt; me.
