The article, &quot;Stephen James Taylor: Taylor-Making A New<br/>Musical Vocabulary,&quot; by Dan Kimpel, appeared the  Nov-Dec 1998 issue<br/>(Vol. 1, #5, pp 28-29). Taylor dicusses his reasons for turning to<br/>alternative tunings and some of the influences on his recent work<br/>including &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love?,&quot; Oprah Winfrey&apos;s TV miniseries,<br/>&quot;The Wedding,&quot; and &quot;Timon and Pumbaa.&quot; Stephen&apos;s 12-tet symphonic and<br/>chamber compositions, including music for the 1996 Olympic ceremonies,<br/>are also mentioned.</p><p>The illustrations include two pictures of Stephen working with the<br/>Microzone Uath-108 generalized keyboard, which is under development by<br/>Starr Labs and Ervin Wilson (for details, see the Starr Labs web page at<br/>URL <a href="http://catalog.com/starrlab/uzone.htm">http://catalog.com/starrlab/uzone.htm</a>).</p><p>FILM MUSIC is a relatively new journal but may be found in large<br/>newstands in the US.</p><p>--John</p></div>
