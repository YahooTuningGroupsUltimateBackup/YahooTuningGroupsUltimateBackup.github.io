Which is just  as well for<br/>them, because the historical record is extremely incomplete  and<br/>inconclusive.</p><p>Johnny:  If you see no difference between us, that certainly says a  lot to<br/>me.  While musicologists mistrust their ears so completely, and  distrust<br/>musicians accordingly, there is indeed room for  concert work.  Sorry you don&apos;t<br/>feel that way.  Recall that Ton  Koopman and Christoph Wolff, 2 of the greatest<br/>Bachologists, believe Bach was  likely in Werckmeister III.  That&apos;s fine<br/>company for me.</p><p>Tom:  They both think that what they choose to perform with, and  sounds good<br/>to them, now, is thereby validated or &apos;proved&apos; or &apos;tested&apos; as  an<br/>actual historical tuning, that what they hear now has some sort  of<br/>backwards-in-time influence on what Bach or Mozart or Haydn did 250  or<br/>300 years ago. That&apos;s the utter insanity of it.</p><p>Johnny: Insanity is to put words in my mouth.  Brad&apos;s views are  public.  My<br/>views are admittedly more vague, but they are not represented  by your<br/>comments, and only a fraction has been posted.  Comparing genuine  tunings from<br/>history with a modern invention demonstrates only so much  prejudice.  As I recall,<br/>your suggestion of choosing just intonation  intervals on flexible<br/>instruments for Bach made no sense at all in the fabric  of Bach&apos;s rapid counterpoint.</p><p>Tom:  They both seem to think that it&apos;s not at all important  whether you<br/>make reasonable or unreasonable claims about what famous  composers<br/>actually did in history - as long as you are happy playing music  now<br/>in the present.</p><p>Johnny: This is just the kind of reaction I was alluding to in my original<br/>post.  I get no financial support to do what I am doing; it is out of love  of<br/>the music.  If you want to continue the poison from the old German  guard, the<br/>same community that equated well-temperament with equal temperament  for oh<br/>so many years, no one can stop you.</p><p>Tom:  That present personal enjoyment is some kind of<br/>substitute  for factually-supported history.</p><p>Johnny: You have no idea what facts are at more disposal.  But I&apos;ll  bet that<br/>if you had never heard Persian music, or Inuit music, or Tuvan  music, you<br/>would believe their tunings either.  It just wouldn&apos;t fit in  your inherited<br/>paradigm.  It&apos;s like Merriam fitting the Flathead Indians  into ET, or any other<br/>ettic (foreign imposed) model.</p><p>Tom:  Well, this would be fine, except that they do insist on  promoting<br/>their current preferences by representing them as some kind of  unique<br/>and objective historical record. Face it, no-one would care in  the<br/>least about Werckmeister or Kirnberger or &apos;Bach-Lehman&apos;, *unless*  a<br/>few people had invested hundreds or thousands of hours and pages  in<br/>argumentation trying to prove to the world systematically that  Bach<br/>used this or that tuning.</p><p>Johnny: And that is why Bach is heard universally in ET.  Disgusting<br/>situation.</p><p>Tom:  Such argumentation leading to one single conclusion  is necessarily<br/>invalid, because in each case the arguer has made a *personal  choice*<br/>which tuning to promote.</p><p>Johnny:  If you have heard my work, it would go a great deal further  for me<br/>to consider your positions.  If you had any Bach that was successful  in any<br/>respect in a non-ET tuning, I would love to hear it.  What do you  have?</p><p>Tom:  There were always MANY possible &apos;Bach<br/>tunings&apos; (given  whatever bits and pieces of evidence one tends to take<br/>seriously) - perhaps  almost an infinite variety of them.</p><p>Johnny:  Problem here is that an infinite possibilities leads to  nothing.<br/>Unacceptable.  All we are getting is ET.</p><p>Tom:  In order to promote one and only one out of these many  possibilities,<br/>you have to<br/>make a personal choice of which one most tickles  your fancy.</p><p>Johnny:  I am only considering actual tunings that are chronologically<br/>possible.  To me it is shameful that this is dismissed so  easily.</p><p>Tom:  The problem is that no-one in the 21st century can  make a personal<br/>choice that exerts an influence on Bach or Mozart or Haydn.  If you<br/>were able to travel in time, and gave those gentlemen the same  choice,<br/>they almost certainly would choose something different.</p><p>Johnny:  This I can agree with.</p><p>Tom:  Anyone who makes such a choice among many alternatives -  based partly<br/>or wholly on his personal taste - then spends several years  telling<br/>anyone who will listen &apos;this was Bach&apos;s tuning&apos; - not to  mention<br/>inventing arguments that &apos;prove&apos; how this one tuning is the only  one<br/>that is historically supported - must be approaching insanity.</p><p>Johnny:  Yes, insanity.  I guess we are now entering your area of  specialty.<br/> I am not out to prove anything.  I will give information  and a narrative<br/>that will suggest a different reality than the one that has been  received.  I<br/>will be careful, as I have been, that Werckmeister III was an  inherited tuning<br/>for J.S. Bach, who was after all the only true Baroque  chromaticist.  It was<br/>on his book shelf throughout his life.</p><p>Tom:  Would it be too hard to acknowledge some vaguely realistic  degree of<br/>uncertainty and personal subjectivity in people&apos;s choice  of<br/>what-tuning-they-play-Bach-with?</p><p>Johnny:  It is a work in progress.  There are no absolutes.   But the idea<br/>that we will never know so we should just accept ET Bach is an idea  who&apos;s time<br/>has gone.  Bradley has proved that people like unequal Bach; it  is simply<br/>more musical.  Now, musical is a concept that does not translate  well in<br/>musicology.  Again, that is the status quo.  Please be glad  that people devote<br/>themselves to music for pure reasons.  All I have done  is &quot;prove&quot; that Bach&apos;s<br/>music has more musical depth in Werckmeister III than it  does in ET.  This is a<br/>horse of a different  color.</p><p>**************Wondering what&apos;s for Dinner Tonight?
