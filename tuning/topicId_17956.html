Like you, I find that tuning a<br/>sequence turns it from 2-D to 3-D in some very tangible way.  To me,<br/>it&apos;s a lot like hearing stereo instead of mono (and boy do I remember<br/>the first time I heard stereo on headphones - it sounded like the woman<br/>singer was hovering just behind my neck - mmmm!).  The feeling is not<br/>quite as explicitly spatial as stereo, but... well, I sure miss it when<br/>back in the 12-tET world.</p><p>Again, thanks so much for your glowing review!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17983 href="#17983">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
