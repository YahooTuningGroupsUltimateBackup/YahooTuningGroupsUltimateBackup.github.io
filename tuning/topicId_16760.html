Though not for<br/>everyone, these are really special work to my mind. And if you can<br/>find these as they were originally released (on vinyl) all the better<br/>too... as some content and a lot of impact is lost on the CD<br/>repackagings; including some of those really vivid E.M. Thomas<br/>engravings from &quot;The World As It Is Today&quot;.</p><p>Cutler&apos;s collaboration with Lutz Glandien &quot;Domestic<br/>Stories&quot; is a nice continuation of the Art Bears&apos; sound with Dagmar,<br/>Frith, Alfred Harth, and a bit more &apos;technology&apos;. I personally liked<br/>it better than the post Art Bears News From Babel records... though<br/>all those have dynamite moments as well; &quot;Letters Home&quot; in particular<br/>has a couple of wonderfully plaintive Robert Wyatt takes on Cutler&apos;s<br/>texts.</p><p>My favorite Henry Cow record is &quot;Western Culture&quot;.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
