Or is the process<br/>&gt; interactive?  In otherwords, do you hear a kind of template, and<br/>then  refine it (sort of like twisting a telescope into focus) as you<br/>move  through ratio space?<br/>&gt;         Reason I ask is that the latter tends to happen to me,<br/>&gt; particularly when I compose in JI.</p><p>mclaren poses here an *extremely* interesting compositional<br/>question.... i.e. how does one actually go about it, and what is the<br/>process.  The suggestion that the ideas are first &quot;in the head&quot; is a<br/>significant one.

Well, in this case,<br/>I believe I absorb the scale as a kind of &quot;template&quot; and STILL try to<br/>find pitches I am initially hearing *in my head* matching these<br/>pitches to the pitches of the scale.</p><p>For this reason, I believe my basic &quot;style&quot; of which I seriously<br/>believe I have one, after many years of composing, is for all<br/>practical purposes THE SAME in 12-tET AND in microtonality.</p><p>It&apos;s just that I have a new, &quot;refreshing&quot; (for *me* at least)<br/>template of pitches that remains in my mind after working with a<br/>scale a bit.</p><p>Then, I try to &quot;find&quot; the pitches I need for my piece from this range<br/>of possibilities.  Since the pitches are xenharmonic and,<br/>therefore, &quot;fresh&quot; to me, the compositional experience at the moment<br/>is more interesting and enjoyable that it would be in 12-tET.</p><p>And, generally speaking, when *I* am getting more out of my<br/>composing, an audience, conceivably, will as well!</p><p>__________ _______ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>BVAL@...</h3><span>7/27/2001 11:03:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph responded :</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; mclaren poses here an *extremely* interesting compositional<br/>&gt; question.... i.e. how does one actually go about it, and what is the<br/>&gt; process.

I believe my problem is that, even though I spend most of<br/>my time improvising on an instrument, when I do write, it is<br/>nearly always &quot;from my head&quot;. Now, my head doesn&apos;t naturally produce<br/>things that have never been heard before, just like Tarzans ability<br/>to learn English language speach by finding English language books<br/>is highly suspect. However, if I pour enough of certain sounds<br/>in, eventually they will settle, metamorphise and come back out<br/>as original music.</p><p>I have had very few ideas which were distinctively microtonal and<br/>they were basically little splashes in an otherwise 12 et piece<br/>of a 7/4 seventh or a neutral third.</p><p>&gt; So, in that sense, I don&apos;t &quot;improvise&quot; if, &quot;improvise&quot; means just<br/>&gt; trying out different things and settling on something acceptable.<br/>&gt; However, I doubt very seriously that fine improvisers work that way,<br/>&gt; either.

And since one<br/>of the words in the title of this list<br/>is &quot;MUSIC,&quot; discussion of various methods<br/>which prove useful for composing microtonal<br/>music seem far more appropriate for this<br/>forum than numerological mumbo-jumbo such<br/>as &quot;Tenney dissonance&quot; and &quot;harmonic<br/>entropy,&quot; whose relevance to real microtonal<br/>music in the real world remains so minimal<br/>as to require a scanning tunneling electron<br/>microscope to detect.<br/>   Experience shows that my own compositional<br/>methods fall into 5 broad categories:</p><p>   [1] Write down the notes using standard<br/>European common practice notation.<br/>   This involves a form of tablature. The<br/>notes on the 5-line staff represent the MIDI<br/>note numbers, not the pitches usually indicated.<br/>Thus, in (say) 49 equal tones per octave, a<br/>C above middle C might indicate an interval<br/>smaller than a minor third above middle C,<br/>whereas in 5-note Pythagorean the same written<br/>note indicates a pitch more than 2 octaves<br/>above middle C.<br/>    Sometimes when using this compositional<br/>method it proves useful to write the notes<br/>down first on conventional score paper,<br/>and only transfer them to the computer for<br/>MIDI sequencing when the paper composition<br/>has reached a stage of final polish. In other<br/>cases -- particularly when using complex<br/>embedded n-tuplet rhythms -- it proves<br/>easier and more musically effective to enter<br/>the notes directly into a computer program<br/>such as Finale.<br/>    ADVANTAGES: This compositional methods<br/>allows extraordinarily complex rhythmic<br/>relationships to be realized with great<br/>precision. It also allows extremely precise<br/>control of polyphony -- for instance, the<br/>composer can insure that polyphonic lines<br/>never cross, or that no vertical note-complex<br/>has more than a given number of pitches, or<br/>that metric modulation can proceed with<br/>great smoothness. Other advantages include<br/>the fact that such a composition can be<br/>brought to state of high perfection, nudging<br/>and tweaking individual notes in a feedback<br/>process that involves listening, making<br/>changes in the score, and resequencing the<br/>MIDI file.<br/>    DISADVANTAGES: By far the biggest<br/>disadvantage of this method is the fact that<br/>enormous amounts of expression must be added<br/>*after* the MIDI file has been created. This<br/>not only involves a great deal of work (nudging<br/>individual grupetti back and forth in time,<br/>adding a specific MIDI velocity for each note,<br/>ramping the tempo map up and down for particular<br/>sections of the score), it also creates more<br/>serious problems.  Specifically, this method<br/>of compositional tends to disconnect the dynamics<br/>and expressive nuances of the composition from<br/>the larger-scale comopsitional structures (viz.,<br/>phrases, periods, chord progressions, recapitulations,<br/>etc.)  Experience has shown that an extremely<br/>important part of making a composition work<br/>involves the close connection twixt expressive<br/>nuance and the compositional structure. For<br/>instance, using rubato combined with a slight<br/>crescendo in a particular phrase can make or<br/>break not only that musical phrase, but the<br/>entire section in which it occurs. This means<br/>that entire section of the music (at least in<br/>my experience) must sometimes get re-composed<br/>because when the pitches and vertical note-complexes<br/>come out, they just don&apos;t work due to their<br/>relation with previous sets of expressive<br/>dynamics and articulations used in a previous<br/>musical section. During live performance or<br/>live improvisation, the performer or improviser<br/>has the luxury of thinking ahead and preparing<br/>for the next musical phrase with proper phrasing<br/>and articulation and dynamics and rubato...but<br/>when composing entirely on paper (at least in<br/>my experience) this becomes much more difficult.<br/>Accordingly composing using this method of<br/>writing the notes down beforehand often creates<br/>difficulties and produces unforeseen problems,<br/>although it also offers some remarkable musical<br/>advantages not available otherwise.<br/>   EXAMPLES: 5 tone equal piano piece #5 from<br/>&quot;240 Piano Pieces,&quot; the 47 and 48 and 49 and 50<br/>tone equal compositions from &quot;Mclaren - Microtonal<br/>Music: Volume 5.&quot;</p><p>   [2] The opposite pole from writing it all<br/>down beforehand involves improvising a section<br/>live and practicing it until it works, then<br/>simply switching on the MIDI sequencer and<br/>recording it as MIDI data. This method has<br/>the advantage that it allows the utmost nuance<br/>and emotinal affect...at the price, however,<br/>of limiting the complexity and subtlety of<br/>the music to the composer&apos;s technical proficiency.<br/>With MIDI sequencers, it&apos;s possible to get around<br/>this problem to a certain extent.  Often I will<br/>slow down the MIDI sequencer when recording and<br/>&quot;think in slow-time&quot; to create rapid chromatic<br/>runs or complex virtuosic sequences which sound<br/>convincing when speeded up by a factor of 150%<br/>or even 200%.  &quot;Thinking in slow-time&quot; involves<br/>putting your brain into a kind of place in which<br/>you try to visualize what the relatively leisurely-<br/>paced melodies and chord progressions you&apos;re entering<br/>will sound like when sped up.  This takes a lot<br/>of practice, and some days it just doesn&apos;t work.<br/>However, with enough experience, &quot;thinking in<br/>slow-time&quot; can prove an effective technique for<br/>getting virtuosic orchestral or instrumental lines<br/>without losing the human articulations and nuances<br/>that go with a live performance.<br/>   However, there&apos;s a sharp limit to the amount of<br/>formal sophistication you can create by doing it all<br/>live. Inevitably, my experience shows that creating<br/>a composition using other methods invariably produces<br/>a richer and more complex musical structure. Now,<br/>if musical structure be the main issue, pure<br/>improvisation won&apos;t work. But the human imagination<br/>can prove surprisingly complex (a number of Chopin&apos;s<br/>and Debussy&apos;s piano pieces appear, from the autograph<br/>evidence, to be improvisations written down), and<br/>complexity of musical structure remains a subsidiary<br/>value when all is said and done. The overall emotional<br/>impact of a piece of music counts for far more than<br/>any arbitrary intellectual measure such as &quot;formal<br/>complexity.&quot; Thus, this method has it uses...particularly<br/>when combined with other compositional methods mentioned<br/>here.  For example, sometimes I start out by improving<br/>a section, then continue using other compositional<br/>methods, then if I hit a tough patch, move back to<br/>improvising a section, and so on.<br/>    ADVANTAGES: Pure improvisation creates the most<br/>&quot;natural&quot; sounding and the most musically nuanced<br/>possible performance -- important with MIDI!<br/>    DISADVANTAGES: Pure improvisation tends to favor<br/>virtuosic effects at the expense of musical depth,<br/>and also tends to limit the composer to hi/r technical<br/>proficiency level, placing a bar of musical complexity<br/>AND overall musical coherence beyond which the composition<br/>can&apos;t go in real time.  In the end, compositional methods<br/>which work outside of real time tend to give the composer<br/>an unfair advantage over pure improvisation, since<br/>outside of real time the composer has the luxury of<br/>going back and changing earlier sections to fit with<br/>later ones, develop transitory themes and harmonic<br/>progressions more fully, etc.  A pure improvisation is<br/>like a sledgehammer tube of toothpaste -- what you get<br/>is what you get, and you can&apos;t change it.  MIDI allows<br/>this limitation to be overcome to a certain extent,<br/>but only (realistically speaking) insofar as the other<br/>compositional methods mentioned here get applied to<br/>an improvisation *after* it has been recorded and<br/>sequenced.<br/>    EXAMPLES: The theme for the 19-tone equal variations<br/>on &quot;McLaren - Microtonal Music: Volume 2,&quot; the piece<br/>in the 14th root of 3 on &quot;McLaren - Microtonal Music: Volume<br/>1.&quot;</p><p>    [3] One big idea.<br/>        This remains the sole and exclusive compositional<br/>technique for most so-called &quot;new&quot; music in serious<br/>music circles nowadays.  The &quot;idea&quot; can involve anything,<br/>but its distinctive characteristic remains its tendency<br/>to overwhelm the music itself.  For example, Gyorgy<br/>Ligeti wrote a composition which calls for 100 metronomes<br/>to get wound upa nd then slowly wind down and slide out<br/>of synchrony -- the composition ends when the last metronome<br/>stops ticking.  Other &quot;idea&quot; compositions involve, for<br/>instance, Nancaroow&apos;s &quot;Canon X,&quot; in which one polyphonic<br/>line starts out at a slow tempo and progressively speeds<br/>up while the other polyphonic line starts at a very rapid<br/>tempo and progressively slows down.  Iannis Xenakis&apos; best-<br/>knwon compositions involve the &quot;big idea&quot; of treating<br/>individual musical notes as atoms in a gas and lettting<br/>many (50 or even 70) instruments use independent polyphonic<br/>lines to create a statistical overall effect.  John<br/>Chwoning composition &quot;Stria&quot; is built around the &quot;big idea&quot;<br/>of using the modulation index of FM synthesis to control<br/>timbral morphing, while Harry Partch&apos;s &quot;And on the Seventh<br/>Day Petals Fell In Petaluma...&quot; is based on the &quot;big idea&quot;<br/>of creating a series of one-minute-long duets for various<br/>combinations of his microtonal instruments.<br/>   ADVANTAGES: This advantage of this compositional technique<br/>is that you can create a striking piece of music using a<br/>very simple basic idea.  The disadvantages include the<br/>fact that once having created such a composition, other<br/>compositions using the same or similar &quot;big idea&quot; tend<br/>to sound trivially similar -- also, this kind of compositional<br/>procedure creates the very real trap of spending all your<br/>time running around hunting for different new &quot;big ideas&quot;<br/>to use for compositions.  Once again, in the end the<br/>main point involves the dramatic gut-punch and emotional<br/>effect of the overall composition. If a &quot;big idea&quot; helps<br/>create that, great...but all too many contemporary composers<br/>spend their careers in a frantic hunt for ever more exotic<br/>and bizarre &quot;big ideas&quot; (burn a piano, flip a coin, roll<br/>a naked girl in paint across a piece of manuscript paper,<br/>play a &apos;cello in the nude, ad nauseum) until the music<br/>itself gradually recedes into unimportance and only the<br/>desperate quest for the shock value of &quot;big ideas&quot; remains.<br/>In the end, music ain&apos;t an idea -- it&apos;s sound, and this<br/>compositional technique can tend to submerge that basic<br/>fact.<br/>   EXAMPLES: 26-tone equal piano piece number 3 from<br/>&quot;240 Piano Pieces,&quot; which uses a Maxwell-Boltzmann<br/>distribution of note density and tempi; metal bar scale<br/>Csound piece from &quot;Mclaren - Microtonal Music: Volume<br/>4,&quot; which uses the free-free inharmonic vibrational<br/>modes of a theoretical metal bar for both melodies<br/>and harmonies: and 28-tone equal piano pieces number 2<br/>from &quot;240 Piano Pieces&quot; which uses 2 identical melodies<br/>an octave apart starting at the smae time, but differing<br/>in tempo by 1%.</p><p>   [4] Composition using layers, typically proceeding<br/>one thread or strand at a time, with slow continual<br/>modification of each melodic line and/or harmony to<br/>relfect the growing structure.<br/>    This method seems favored by the most composers<br/>as a general approach. By allowing the composer to<br/>work outside of real time, it allows much greater<br/>complexity and subtlety, and also give the composer<br/>the opportunity to unify the composition to a much<br/>greater degree than with most other methods. For<br/>instance, by modifying ealier or later musical phrases<br/>to foreshadow or echo later or earlier material, the<br/>composer can create a much greater impression of<br/>musical unity.  Alternatively, if on repeated<br/>listenings a section proves too &quot;dead&quot; sounding<br/>or too repetitive, the composer can simply slice<br/>it out and insert new material to add variety. Since<br/>all music involves a continual dynamic balance twixt<br/>unity and variety, this compositional method allows<br/>the best overall balance twixt unity and variety.<br/>     ADVANTAGES: This compositional method, in<br/>my experience, serves as the msot flexible vehicle<br/>for the widest possible variety of musical material.<br/>Whether in composing a virtuoso solo study or a complex<br/>dense polyphonic structure, this method of composition<br/>seems to distort the musical material least of all.<br/>By contrast, using a &quot;big idea&quot; can often twist the<br/>music into the service of an obtrusive abstract<br/>concept...while composing using notes on paper<br/>tends to overemphasive the pitch and rhythm at<br/>the expense of less visible (but equally musically<br/>important) qualities like drama and excitement and<br/>emotional impact.<br/>     DISADVANTAGES: Composing by laying down layers<br/>can and in my experience sometimes does lead the<br/>composer into dead ends. There is a tendency to<br/>produce one or two melodic lines, or a combo of<br/>melody and harmony, which sound great by themselves<br/>but less impressive when combined. This problem<br/>couldbe called &quot;the war of the parts against the<br/>whole.&quot;  When laying down a composition in layers,<br/>it&apos;s hard to keep in mind that the overall goal<br/>remains creating a gestalt that works musically...<br/>It can be frustratingly easy to create two<br/>individual melodic lines which sound impressive<br/>and very effective each by itself, but which<br/>lose their musical impact when combined. Often,<br/>this compositional method can create frustration<br/>for the composoer because it sometimes becomes<br/>necessary to throw away wonderful harmonic<br/>progressions or melodic passages because however<br/>impressive and effective they sound by themselves,<br/>they just don&apos;t fit with the overall composition<br/>as it grows and lengthens throughout time.<br/>    EXAMPLES: 43-limit just intonation piece<br/>from &quot;Beyond All Limits -- Volume 1,&quot; 28-tone<br/>equal piano piece #4 from &quot;240 Piano Pieces,&quot;<br/>Csound infinite continued fraction scale<br/>compositon #1.</p><p>   [5] Pick an overall structure and fill it in.<br/>This compositional method, taught as &quot;the&quot; method<br/>in most undergrad college compositional courses<br/>(if the textboosk provide any guide), remains<br/>extremely useful.  Abandoned for a number of<br/>decades beginning around 1905 or 1910, this<br/>compositional method has re-emerged as composers<br/>realized by around 1975 that there exist only<br/>a finite number of comprehensible overall methods<br/>of structuring compositions.<br/>   Twixt WW II and 1975, the emphasis in &quot;serious&quot;<br/>music (so-called) involved the attempt by each<br/>composer to create hi/r own private code, what<br/>Stockhausen called &quot;a separate genetic code&quot;<br/>embedded in eachcomposition which serves as its<br/>structural blueprint. All too soon, however,<br/>composers found that while they could create private<br/>compositional codes of unlimited variety and<br/>complexity, listeners could not perceive an<br/>unlimited number of limitlessly complex private<br/>compositional structures.<br/>   By around 1975, composers began to realize that<br/>many traditional forms owed their musical power<br/>not to tradition but to basic aspects of the<br/>human ear/brain system and the human nervous<br/>system.  For example, long slow accretions of<br/>pitch tend (whatever the composer intends or<br/>mathematically tries to produce) to create a<br/>sense of tension.  Likewise, sudden highly<br/>chromatic fortissimo staccato note-clusters<br/>tend to generate (regardless of what the composer<br/>intends or calculates) to create emotions of<br/>distress and anxiety.  And so on.<br/>    As a result, age-old compositional structures<br/>like the A-B-A arch form and the rondo and the<br/>variation form, however they may get stretched<br/>by contemporary composers, have retained their<br/>musical effectiveness.<br/>    ADVANTAGES: Classic methods of structuring<br/>music, like the binary form or the rondo form,<br/>produce musical effects which seem more reliably<br/>audible than new private compositional codes<br/>invented by the composer for that piece of<br/>music alone. These relatively simple classic<br/>methods of structuring music offer the advantage<br/>of relatively clear audibility, at the expense<br/>of formal complexity.  In the Romantic period,<br/>composers added to formal complexity by lengthening<br/>the overall classic structure (viz., adding more<br/>recapitulations to a sonata-allegro form, or<br/>tacking on more extended digressions when<br/>the countersubject of a fugue entered), but these<br/>options are generally speaking not available today.<br/>Romantic composers had not only the advantage of<br/>an audience more steeped in traditional forms<br/>than today&apos;s audience, but the Romantic composer<br/>also dealt with an audience used to a more leisurely<br/>musical pace (which allowed much greater formal<br/>complexity courtesy of extensions and digressions<br/>from classic forms like the rondo). Today&apos;s<br/>audience demands faster-paced symphonies -- to<br/>my knowledge, for instance, no contemporary young<br/>composer has written a 90-minute-long Mahler-length<br/>new symphony. New symphonies today written by<br/>contemporary composers tend to be much shorter<br/>than traditional Romantic-era or even classical-era<br/>symphonies...often as short as 10 minutes or 15<br/>minutes, compared to the broad expansive musical<br/>forms of a Brahms or a Wagner, to see nothing of<br/>a Mahler.  However, another great advatnage of<br/>using a classic form like the rondo or the<br/>variation form is that it allows the composer to<br/>produce a very comprehensibly organized piece of<br/>music without spending unnecessary effort to<br/>dream up some exotic new method of musical<br/>organization (which might not prove audible to<br/>the audience, after all&apos;s said and done). For<br/>instance, Lou Harrison uses the clever method<br/>of sometimes simply writing &quot;pivot&quot; notes at<br/>key points of a phrase and then drawing in broad<br/>arcs to indicate the general length of the phrase--<br/>he then goes back and fills in the phrases in<br/>detail later. This allows maximum control over<br/>the general pacing and large-scale audible structure<br/>of a composition.<br/>    DISADVANTAGES:  The flip side of that coin<br/>involves the tendency to focus on the macro-level<br/>and ignore the individual melodic or harmonic details<br/>which can often add much of the life and verve to<br/>a piece of music. By tending to force the composer<br/>into a panoramic view of the overall piece of music,<br/>this compositional method can create an overall<br/>sense of &quot;blahness&quot;...the sense that something<br/>musically comprehensible and coherent is going on<br/>at a large formal scale, but about which the listener<br/>doesn&apos;t much care--since the specific vivid surprises<br/>and quirks and unexpected melodic and harmonic turns<br/>are lacking.  Since all music involves a dyanmic<br/>balance twixt unity and variety, this compositional<br/>method can create a danger by overemphasizing<br/>predictability and large-scale form at the expense<br/>of those crucial unpredictable exotica that often make<br/>or break a composition...for instance, the abrupt<br/>breakdown of the two-melody pattern at the very<br/>end of Bach&apos;s second prelude (c minor) in WTK I,<br/>or the unexpected juxtaposition of different musical<br/>styles that occurs in Stravinksy&apos;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;<br/>(third section).<br/>    EXAMPLES: Second movement from 15 tone equal<br/>piano concerto (an ABA&apos; binary form where A&apos; uses<br/>the inversion of the primary melody in A) from<br/>&quot;McLaren - Microtonal Music: Volume 3&quot;;  19 tone<br/>equal variations from &quot;McLaren - Microtonal Music<br/>Volume 2&quot;; 9 tone equal canon by inversion from<br/>&quot;Mclaren - Microtonal Music: Volume 1.&quot;<br/>---------<br/>    How do these general compositional methods<br/>relate specifically to microtonal music?<br/>    In my experience, very often the tuning<br/>provides either the &quot;big idea&quot; or part of the<br/>binary form or rondo form or variation form...<br/>and the tuning certain exerts a powerful<br/>influence on an improvisation.  For example:<br/>improvisations in 17 equal will tend to<br/>emphasize 17&apos;s melodic brilliance, while<br/>improvisations in (say) 19 equal typically<br/>gravitate more toward the conventional-sounding<br/>major and minor harmonies available in 19.<br/>In a non-just non-equal-tempered tunings<br/>using an inharmonic series, improvisations<br/>tend to sound more expansive than in, say,<br/>harmonic series 1-60 or subharmonic series<br/>1-60.  In a relatively higher JI limit such as<br/>61, composing using layers tends (in my<br/>experience) to take advantage of the increased<br/>melodic subtleties available in such high<br/>JI limits, while composing using layers in<br/>(say) 17-note or 19-note Pythagorean tends<br/>to generate more active dyanmic composition<br/>to make up for the more limited melodic<br/>resources.<br/>   In my experience, the harmonies available<br/>in a particular xenharmonic scale don&apos;t exert<br/>that much influence. In a JI composition, for<br/>instance, if while composing a piece it turns<br/>out that a required chord lacks a smooth<br/>fifth I will typically merely use an octave<br/>or a third instead and the listener will typically<br/>&quot;fill in&quot; that dyad as a functional triad if<br/>it occurs in the context of other smooth<br/>functional JI triads nearby.  Likewise, the<br/>lack of smooth triads in equal temperaments<br/>like 11 or 13, or in JI non-octave tunings which<br/>may use a perfect fifth but no recognizable thirds,<br/>or in exotic NJ NET tunings, has little overall<br/>impact on the overall structure or emotional<br/>effect of the composition (in my experience).<br/>The reason for this is that melody proves<br/>far more important in music than harmony,<br/>and even in some JI compositions in which I<br/>have deliberately made use of triads with p5ths<br/>which are rougher than just by a comma, the listener<br/>often gets carried along by the melodic momentum<br/>to such an extent that the roughness or smoothness<br/>of specific harmonies just don&apos;t seem to matter.<br/>    Much more important that the acoustic smoothness<br/>of the intervals available in a given xenharmonic<br/>tuning are issues like the presence of absence<br/>of overall musical drama...the degree of excitement<br/>created by a melodic arc...and the degree to which<br/>a large-scale formal buildup (which Nadia Boulanger<br/>called &quot;the long line&quot;) pays off with a musically<br/>satisfying conclusion.  Compared to these issues,<br/>acoustic smoothness of intervals in the tuniing<br/>(as measured by pseudoscientific gibberish like<br/>&quot;harmonic entropy&quot;) plays a trivial role of<br/>the utmost inconsequentiality.<br/>---------<br/>    Very often, certain tunings will inherently<br/>suggest certain large-scale musical forms. For<br/>example, 35 tone equal immediately suggests a<br/>rondo form -- 7 equal followed by 5 equal followed<br/>by 7 equal followed by 7 + 5 equal simultaneously<br/>followed by 7 equal followed by 35 equal as a<br/>chromatic field (and so on).<br/>    Or a Wilson CPS, which contains other smaller<br/>CPSs within it, may suggest a rondo form or a<br/>binary form -- A B A, with A (say) a dekany and<br/>B a hexany inside it, etc.<br/>    Certain non-just non-equal-tempered tunings<br/>may immediately suggest specific overall musical<br/>forms -- for example, if an inharmonic series<br/>is self-similar it may offer the xenharmonic<br/>composer a particular musical form like a canon,<br/>in which the leader might use on section of an<br/>&quot;octave&quot; as the leader of the canon (in Erv&apos;s usage<br/>-- my term is &quot;cyclic multiplier,&quot; any repeating<br/>frequency multiplier) and a self-similar section<br/>of the same &quot;octave&quot; with smaller NJ NET intervals<br/>as the follower.<br/>   Or, for example, a sonata form might use<br/>a harmonic series for the statement of the theme<br/>and a subharmonic series where the classical<br/>composer would ordnarily modulate to a secondary<br/>key center.  In an NJ NET tuning, these would<br/>take the form of an inharmonic series versus<br/>the subinharmonic series.<br/>---------<br/>   Clearly one of the great advantages of composing<br/>outside 12, aside from the sheer increase in the<br/>composer&apos;s emotional vocabulary, is the tremendous<br/>potential for new and exciting variants of audibly<br/>comprehensible compositional methods. One of the<br/>great problems facing late 20th century composers<br/>is the relative exhaustion of traditional compositional<br/>methods -- whenever a tonal composer modulated to<br/>the relative minor in 12, for instance, everyone<br/>knew what it was going to sound like. Efforts to<br/>break out of traditional compositional procedures<br/>and invent entirely new ones enjoyed only limited<br/>success, since as Fred Lerdahl and Leonard Meyer<br/>have pointed out comprehensible large-scale musical<br/>structures and audible methods of musical organization<br/>tend to take much of their power for structuring<br/>music from the close linkage between sensory consonance<br/>and cultural musical syntax. This linkage cannot be<br/>broken arbitrarily...80 years of experience by<br/>audiences who find atonal or statistically or<br/>purely mathematically-organized music audibly<br/>unstructured assure us that basic aspects of the<br/>human nervous system and the human ear/brain system<br/>constrain the range of possible audible compositional<br/>methods on many levels.<br/>   One solution involved the arbitrary creation of<br/>large-scale statistical methods of organizing<br/>music -- Ligeti&apos;s and Penderecki&apos;s and Xenakis&apos;<br/>&quot;statistical&quot; structuring of music.  This tends<br/>to lead to a dead end, however, since eventually<br/>every &quot;statistical&quot; piece of textural music tends<br/>to sound alike after a while -- large-scale jittery<br/>sounding &quot;fuzzy&quot; stuff going on, lots of simultaneous<br/>glissandi, and so on.  Lacking are the kinds of eloquent<br/>melodies capable of the &quot;long line&quot; which proves so<br/>important in creating effective musical drama.<br/>   Another solution invovles greatly increasing<br/>rhythmic complexity while arbitrarily reducing the<br/>tonal language to a relatively less chromatic<br/>(often modal) subset of pitches. This solution was<br/>pioneered by Conlon Nancarrow can continues in use<br/>today by many younger composers such as Julia Wolfe<br/>and Michael Gordon, with considerable success.<br/>   However, a third solution involves refracting<br/>traditional compositional methods (such as the<br/>5 mentioned above) through the lens of a microtonal<br/>scale, creating a rainbow of new musical possibilities<br/>based on tried and true methods of musical organization.<br/>As J. J. Nattiez has pointed out, the central pathology<br/>of so-called &quot;serious&quot; modern music involves &quot;neopathy&quot; --<br/>the obsessive compulsion to do something new at all<br/>costs...even at the cost of destroying audible<br/>comprehensibility and perceptible musical organization.<br/>    Xenharmonic tunings offer such a solution.<br/>---------<br/>    While Joseph Pehrson and Mary Ackerley have written<br/>in some detail about the compositional methods they use<br/>to create microtonal music, other practicing microtonal<br/>composer like Jacky Ligon and Jeff Scott and Kraig Grady<br/>have not.<br/>    Have about it, folks?<br/>    I know something about the overall notation you use<br/>for some of your music, Kraig, from your article in<br/>Xenharmonikon...

The reason for this is simple -- I know how<br/>I&apos;d like to compose microtonally, and the tools I want don&apos;t<br/>exist yet.  So, I&apos;ve chosen to use my time to create those tools<br/>first.  It shouldn&apos;t take more than 10 years to do this, but if<br/>it does, so be it.  In the meantime, I&apos;m composing in good old<br/>12-tET, for which there are excellent tools, and I&apos;m learning to<br/>sight-read classical music at the piano.</p><p>It became apparent to me early on that, unless you&apos;re a guitarist,<br/>tools do not exist to make world-class microtonal music.  So, the<br/>first step was to learn enough theory to know what kind of tools<br/>would do the job.  That step is done.  Quite contrary to what<br/>Brian says, theory does a great job here.  I also checked out the<br/>two established ways to make microtonal music:</p><p>1.  I built a 15-limit guitar.  I&apos;m not a guitarist, but this<br/>instrument is very valuable to me for ear training.  John<br/>Starrett (hi, John!) also showed me that in a guitarist&apos;s hands,<br/>the instrument was capable of making world-class music.  I<br/>almost gave it to him on the spot.</p><p>2.  I did a lot of something I like to do anyway, and that&apos;s<br/>sing.  To date, Barbershop is still the only established musical<br/>form that both claims, and delivers, anything higher than the<br/>5-limit, as far as polyphonic, consonant music goes.</p><p>Then, I experimented with the following methods of composing<br/>microtonal music:</p><p>--1.  I took the manuscript-writing skills I learned with 12-tET,<br/>the microtonal ear training I did with my guitar, and the knowledge<br/>of meantone accidentals (non &apos;enharmonic equivalent&apos;) I got from<br/>studying microtonal theory, and I wrote some music.  I put the<br/>music in my computer, and got out (12-tET) MIDI files.</p><p>I used JdL&apos;s adaptune software to retune some of them, but the<br/>software doesn&apos;t pay attention to the accidentals (actually, my<br/>score entry package doesn&apos;t even preserve them in the MIDI files<br/>it makes), so those retunings aren&apos;t anything like I had in mind<br/>(also, I usually compose in the 11-limit, while the version of<br/>adaptune I had only went to the 7-limit).  I took this experience<br/>and wrote an algorithm to do adaptive tuning the way I think it<br/>should be done.  That&apos;s new tool number 1.  I&apos;m currently learning<br/>C at work, and I imagine it&apos;ll be up and running within 2-3 years.</p><p>I also had a brass quartet (two trumets, french horn, and tuba)<br/>perform one of the works at an AFMM concert in New York.  Sadly,<br/>it proved impossible to get the boys together enough to have them<br/>learn 11-limit JI.  But they got the 5-limit fairly well.  Remember<br/>everybody, nobody in New York has more than 5 minutes for anything,<br/>no matter how much you pay them (just one of the many reasons<br/>that city is high on my list of suggested nuclear test sites).</p><p>--2.  I looked at various 12-tone scales, and created a few I liked.<br/>I learned how to tune and regulate pianos, and retuned two pianos.<br/>On the tuning list, I learned that one of the scales was used by<br/>Wilson/Grady/Poole, and the other appeared (rotated in the lattice)<br/>in a paper issued by Wilson in 1969.  I recorded about an hour of<br/>improvised music in the first, and put some mpeg excerpts on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>.</p><p>I then bought a Kawai K5000s keyboard (for $450 at Sam Ash, I got<br/>one of the last new K5000&apos;s sold in the states).  This is one of<br/>the best keyboards ever brought to market.  It can only do quarter<br/>tones, but I used Graham Breed&apos;s MIDIRelay to retune it from my PC.<br/>Unlike Brian, I don&apos;t believe in using more than 12-tone scales on<br/>the Halberstadt keyboard.  I recorded a bunch of music with this<br/>setup that I haven&apos;t released, and will never release.  It&apos;s for me.</p><p>Back in 1997, I had a couple of righteous jams with excellent<br/>musician Pat Pagano, on a Baldwin organ retuned to 7+ limit scale<br/>by Denny Genovese (still don&apos;t know exactly what it was).  A CD<br/>of this material is available to anyone who asks nice, except for<br/>Brian McLaren.  The rest of it was stolen from my car in Oakland<br/>in 1998, but not before several people had heard it.</p><p>...and those are the two methods I&apos;ve used.  Now let&apos;s talk about<br/>new methods.  We&apos;ve already seen new method 1 (my adaptive tuning<br/>algorithm, which was described in an article on the tuning list,<br/>and on my web site).</p><p>New Method 2.</p><p>I want a general MIDI engine that takes note-ons from one MIDI<br/>channel, and uses them to re-root a tuning on another channel(s).<br/>Then, I&apos;ll use it with: (a) A two-manual organ with full pedal,<br/>so that root-control may be assigned to either manual or the<br/>pedal, or turned off, and may be sounding or silent. and (b) a<br/>score entry package where a staff may be assigned to root control,<br/>sounding or not...</p><p>New Method 3.</p><p>A keyboard with more than 12 tones per octave.  I&apos;ve read and<br/>traveled extensively to learn about what I want... I&apos;ve got every<br/>extant paper by Bosanquet on microfilm/xerox, I&apos;ve met with Erv<br/>Wilson, Michael Zarkey (and played his 19-of-31 harpsichord), and<br/>Scott Hackleman (and played his 19-tET clavichord), Harvey Starr<br/>(and fingered his prototype MicroZone), and Paul Vandervoort<br/>(and played his Janko-keyboard piano).  I even lived with Norman<br/>Henry for three months, playing his 11-limit harpsichord and<br/>helping him develop his 15-limit fortepiano.  My conclusion is<br/>that Wilson&apos;s hexagonal keys are not desirable.  Vandervoort has<br/>the best bet, and his MIDI controller (with polyphonic aftertouch,<br/>optical action, for about $2000!) will be along shortly.</p><p>--<br/>Both these new methods use a MIDI synth.  I&apos;ve learned from contacts<br/>on the tuning list (special thanks to John Loffink) that only three<br/>synths are really up to the job... 1. Kurzweil K2500-2600 series,<br/>2. Emu Proteus 2000 family, and 3. Kyma.  These also make up some of<br/>the best sounding synths on the market (also notable for good sound<br/>is the Korg Triton series).  Of these, the Kurzweil has the root<br/>choosing engine already built in (thanks to Wendy Carlos), but the<br/>price/perform. isn&apos;t that good, seeing as how Kyma costs less and does<br/>way more (you just have to write the stuff yourself, in SmallTalk).<br/>The Proteus can be had for $850 or so, and I may buy one this week.<br/>Kyma is the best choice for everything, but it is expensive, and you<br/>have to make everything yourself -- it&apos;s not so much an out-of-the-box<br/>musical instrument as it is a sound computation engine, though Marcus<br/>Hobbs has a library of tools he&apos;s willing to share, and Breed will<br/>no doubt be out with some stuff too.</p><p>That&apos;s it!

One could<br/>easily program to look at one of the midi channels and use it<br/>just for the purpose of changing the tunings used in the others.<br/>E.g. that the tuning is in just intonatino 12 tone (or whatever<br/>scale has all the chords one wants in it), and then using the<br/>root control channel, you change the point at which the scale<br/>starts. E.g. play an A in the root control panel and it will<br/>shift the scale so that the 1/1 is A. Might not necessarily be<br/>the root of the chord you want I suppose, but one could get<br/>used to which notes to press where for which chords.</p><p>Then, you have question of how to dovetail that to the notes<br/>already played, and I suppose you soon then get into<br/>comma shifts, or methods to correct pitch drift, but doing<br/>it this way with your idea of a root control channel,<br/>seems to me there mightn&apos;t be that much to do, just note how far you<br/>have got from the original pitch of the note and if it is further<br/>than a certain amount, let the pitch of the piece drift back home<br/>at some fixed maximum drift rate (or maybe let the rate of<br/>drift back depend on how fast the passages are, or on how far<br/>away one has got).</p><p>If though the root control is for the chord, and prog. needs<br/>to recognise that, then that I gather from John it is far harder<br/>to do as not all notes have been played yet and it isn&apos;t easy for<br/>a program to anticipate what notes are yet to be played in<br/>a chord as it is played. That is, unless one were to put in a<br/>delay there, so that the notes sound, say, a half second<br/>after they are played, which one could prob. get used to<br/>using as the delayed action would be a bit like a (non electically<br/>controlled) acoustic organ.</p><p>Another idea, maybe one could maybe devise a kind of figured<br/>base type idea where you play several notes at once in the<br/>root control manual to tell the software the exact chord to<br/>expect, with one of them as the default if you play<br/>just a single note, and maybe do it so most common chords<br/>only need two notes (e.g. play two notes a tone apart for<br/>dom7th with root on upper note)... Might work if one is<br/>using one hand for root control, and one for playing a solo<br/>line, perhaps.</p><p>John and I have discussed on TL, I think while you were away,<br/>idea of leisure adaptive tuning of a piece in his program,<br/>then another program, such as maybe FTS has job of going<br/>through a second playing of the piece, the actual performance,<br/>and retuning it  according to the information in the leisure<br/>adaptive tuning. So that is something else one can explore.</p><p>Issue there, especially for practicing using this method,<br/>is how to quickly find ones place in the leisure time retuned<br/>file if the performer skips to another part of the piece,<br/>or stops and plays a section again. Bearing in mine here that<br/>the chords will prob. not be played in the exact same order<br/>of notes at microsecond level, which complicates matters<br/>if one is trying to recognise them. We explored a few ideas,<br/>enough to see that it might be a feasible thing to do.</p><p>&gt; New Method 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A keyboard with more than 12 tones per octave.

Assumes one already is familiar<br/>&gt; with the basic ideas of Windows C as in Petzold&apos;s book.

I&apos;ve put it in the queue (yes, I&apos;m using windows c).</p><p>&gt;&gt; I want a general MIDI engine that takes note-ons from one MIDI<br/>&gt;&gt; channel, and uses them to re-root a tuning on another channel(s).<br/>&gt;&gt; Then, I&apos;ll use it with: (a) A two-manual organ with full pedal,<br/>&gt;&gt; so that root-control may be assigned to either manual or the<br/>&gt;&gt; pedal, or turned off, and may be sounding or silent. and (b) a<br/>&gt;&gt; score entry package where a staff may be assigned to root control,<br/>&gt;&gt; sounding or not...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Another one of those ideas that many people have independently<br/>&gt; &gt; discovered.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s true of many good ideas. When the time is ripe you find maybe three<br/>people have come up with it independently or something, maybe more.</p><p>I thought I&apos;d invented the idea of a fractal tune when I first started<br/>on FTS actually, then discovered this whole active field of algorithimic<br/>composition.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Some of it sounds easy enough to do in software. One could<br/>&gt; &gt; easily program to look at one of the midi channels and use it<br/>&gt; &gt; just for the purpose of changing the tunings used in the others.<br/>&gt; &gt; E.g. that the tuning is in just intonatino 12 tone (or whatever<br/>&gt; &gt; scale has all the chords one wants in it), and then using the<br/>&gt; &gt; root control channel, you change the point at which the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; starts. E.g. play an A in the root control panel and it will<br/>&gt; &gt; shift the scale so that the 1/1 is A. Might not necessarily be<br/>&gt; &gt; the root of the chord you want I suppose, but one could get<br/>&gt; &gt; used to which notes to press where for which chords.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s the general idea, yes.  It&apos;s worth noting that I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; only want to re-root to members of the current scale (I believe<br/>&gt; this is the behavior the K2500/K2600&apos;s support, and was the<br/>&gt; behavior Justonic&apos;s software was supposed to support), but also<br/>&gt; to members of a different scale entirely.

That would do the<br/>tonality diamond just as it is - play the control note<br/>and note on the main keyboard, and you&apos;ll hear the product.</p><p>Then for e.g. mean-tone modulation of j.i. scale, I suppose<br/>one will want e.g. the A of the main keyboard to still sound<br/>an A whatever the root of the j.i. scale is, e.g. if root<br/>key pressed is the F, you play the A as a 5/4 above the meantone F.<br/>That would require all of another couple of lines of code or something!</p><p>The whole thing would prob. only need maybe two or three dozen lines of<br/>programming if I were to add it to FTS, what with the way everything is set up<br/>already for this type of thing. Most of the work involved in fact<br/>would be thinking where to put it in the program, the user interface,<br/>and how to relate it to everything else. I could do it at same<br/>time as I do the generalisation of Graham&apos;s scale morphing idea<br/>to arbitrary modes / scales, as both will require one to have a<br/>second scale or mode to hand. FTS actually already has a multiple scales<br/>in play at once option for the fractal tunes, and I could adapt that<br/>in some way, or may decide it is clearer to have a new section.</p><p>Does the idea of doing it in FTS appeal?

The major second is three chromatic steps and the minor<br/>second is two chromatic steps, but since there are pitches in<br/>between these can be used to fool the ear when they are substituted<br/>for the one expected.The two sizes of minor third can be used to great<br/>effect by using a step wise walk down or up, for instance, and every<br/>once in a while sneaking in one of the chromatic steps. I have<br/>uploaded two samples of guitar moving between a functional 4 and 5<br/>chord. See if you can tell what I am doing here, and what the<br/>difference between the two is.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>8/8/2001 8:14:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;John Starrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/957">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/957</a></p><p>&gt; Yes, there are all kinds of cool tricks you can use in 19tet<br/>&gt; modulation.

Here&apos;s my two<br/>cents for a 3/2 on the subject.</p><p>Although I can compose with paper, pencil and eraser, and have used this<br/>process for some film scoring, the guitar is a highly idiomatic instrument<br/>and I prefer to compose hands on the instrument. Often I start with an open<br/>tuning, and improvise. If I come up with an idea I like in the improv, I<br/>keep coming back to it to develop it further. Sometimes the process takes<br/>months or even years, having little incomplete bits hanging around, waiting<br/>for the right perspective for completion. Every now and then I get lucky and<br/>a piece just &quot;shows up&quot;, fully formed and ready to go.</p><p>For a long time, I&apos;ve liked the idea of composing using instruments I didn&apos;t<br/>play, so as to not be boxed in by my abilities on guitar. I&apos;d compose a<br/>melody on an instrument other than guitar, then transfer it to guitar. A<br/>fringe benefit of this approach is that I&apos;ve ended up learning to play many<br/>of these instruments with proficiency.</p><p>I tend to be lazy about notation, I find it extremely arduous to try and<br/>notate exactly things that I play slightly differently every time. Using<br/>Finale doesn&apos;t make things any easier. I usually record my pieces so I don&apos;t<br/>forget them. Of course, recording can be pretty stressful as well. These<br/>days I&apos;m less interested in touring around the country, sleeping on floors,<br/>playing the same dozen pieces over and over again so as to sell a few CDs,<br/>so I&apos;m trying to get more disciplined about writing down my music so other<br/>performers can play it, and send me those fabulous royalty checks :-)</p><p>As far as composing microtonal pieces go, it has been a slow process. I&apos;ve<br/>used intentional deviances from 12-tET in my slide guitar and fiddle playing<br/>for years, without saying that a particular note was a five or seven limit<br/>tone, just playing what felt right. Some of my current learning of JI has<br/>been a way to further describe and hone what I was doing naturally. Like<br/>planting a seed, watering it, and letting the seasons and elements do their<br/>part, I am taking this approach with microtonality, over time it is becoming<br/>a natural part of my musical language. I&apos;ve been aquiring various<br/>instruments, such as fretless guitar and banjo, didjs, overtone flutes, and<br/>previously to that, 31 and 19 tET guitars, and learning to play and sing in<br/>JI accurately. I&apos;ve done alot of improvising, and a fair amount of reading<br/>and studying. I know that at some point in time, in the not too distant<br/>future, I will better internalize this language, and more music will<br/>happen/be composed.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: seth@...<br/>klezmusic@...</p></div>
