Please unlock the code. For example, how does<br/>&gt; the expression 4/5 relate to the expression 4:5? Also,<br/>&gt; what does 1/x represent? I really would like to know what<br/>&gt; you are saying here.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to clarify here, Jerry.</p><p>The numbers that &apos;appear to be fractions separated by colons&apos;<br/>are simply the *utonal* proportions for the tones in Paul&apos;s<br/>chord.</p><p>The term &apos;utonal&apos; was coined by Partch, and is short for<br/>&apos;under-tonal&apos;.  The definition in my online Tuning Dictionary<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/utonal.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/utonal.htm</a><br/>is the one Partch gives in his book:</p><p>&gt; [Partch 1974, p 75]<br/>&gt; Otonality:<br/>&gt; one of those tonalities expressed by the under numbers<br/>&gt; [denominators] of ratios having a Numerary Nexus<br/>&gt; [in the numerator] -- in current musical theory,<br/>&gt; &quot;minor&quot; tonality.</p><p>(It wasn&apos;t until I looked at this (and Partch&apos;s definition<br/>for the counterpart, otonality) this morning that I<br/>realized that, without my editorial addition of &apos;[in<br/>the numerator]&apos;, Partch&apos;s definition is so inadequate<br/>as to be misleading.)</p><p>And of course you also need the definition for<br/>&apos;numerary nexus&apos;:</p><p>&gt; [Partch 1974, p 75]<br/>&gt; Numerary Nexus:<br/>&gt; the number common to all identities in the ratios of<br/>&gt; one tonality -- the common anchor; the characteristic<br/>&gt; of a series of ratios that determines them as a tonality.<br/>&gt; In the 8/5 Otonality the Numerary Nexus is 5, as seen in<br/>&gt; the sequence of the six Odentities:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/10 [= 11/5 in Partch&apos;s theory]<br/>&gt; 9/5<br/>&gt; 7/5<br/>&gt; 6/5<br/>&gt; 1/1 (= 5/5)<br/>&gt; 8/5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 5/4 Utonality the Numerary Nexus is also 5, as seen<br/>&gt; in the sequence of the six Udentities:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 20/11 [= 5/11]<br/>&gt; 10/9 [= 5/9]<br/>&gt; 10/7 [= 5/7]<br/>&gt; 5/3<br/>&gt; 1/1 (= 5/5)<br/>&gt; 5/4</p><p>I&apos;ll work thru an obvious example here to help you understand.</p><p>You&apos;re already clear on how &apos;otonality&apos; works: simple<br/>integers between colons shows the proportions in a chord<br/>as they are related otonally; for example, the typical<br/>just &apos;major&apos; chord is 4:5:6, meaning that the middle note<br/>is a 4:5 above the &apos;root&apos; (represented by the 4), and the<br/>top note is a 4:6 [= 2:3] above the &apos;root&apos; and a 5:6 above<br/>the middle note.</p><p>And you&apos;re probably already familiar with the way a<br/>typical just &apos;minor&apos; chord is expressed with this kind<br/>of proportional notation: 10:12:15, meaning that the<br/>middle note is a 10:12 [= 5:6] above the &apos;root&apos; (represented<br/>here by the 10), and the top note is a 10:15 [= 2:3] above<br/>the &apos;root&apos; and a 12:15 [= 4:5] above the middle note.</p><p>These proportions are otonal because they all assume<br/>a denominator for the ratios which is the same (or an<br/>&apos;octave&apos; equivalent, i.e., a doubled or quadrupled number).</p><p>But this particular minor chord can be expressed more<br/>simply (that is, with smaller numbers) by assuming a<br/>*numerator* which is the same for all the ratios, and<br/>looking at the proportions in the denominators.  Here&apos;s<br/>how it&apos;s done:</p><p>First, we know that the 10:12:15 proportion is an otonal<br/>one.  So we can simply put &apos;1&apos; as our denominator for all<br/>three ratios, and that will still give us the otonal<br/>proportions, because their Numerary Nexus (in the<br/>denominator) is 1.</p><p>Now, to convert to utonal proportions, we have to find<br/>the LCM (least common multiple - the lowest number which<br/>can be divided into all of the intended factors) of<br/>our three proportions.  The LCM of 10, 12, and 15 is 60.</p><p>So if we multiply each of the numerators by the required<br/>number to obtain the LCM, which in this case is 6, 5, and 4<br/>respectively, and multiply the denominators by the same<br/>numbers, we obtain a set of ratios which now have a<br/>Numerary Nexus in the *numerator* and thus spell out a<br/>utonal proportion in the denominators:</p><p>10  12  15<br/>--  --  --<br/> 1   1   1</p><p>=</p><p>60  60  60<br/>--  --  --<br/> 6   5   4</p><p>Just as we &apos;throw out&apos; the Numerary Nexus in our description<br/>of otonal proportions, we may simply reduce the numerator<br/>here to 1, and we get 1/6:1/5:1/4 as our utonal description<br/>of the 10:12:15 &apos;minor&apos; chord.</p><p>So now let&apos;s reverse that process to determine the otonal<br/>proportions in Paul&apos;s 1/24:1/19:1/16 chord.</p><p>The LCM of the denominators is 912, so we make this our<br/>numerator:</p><p>912  912  912<br/>---  ---  ---<br/> 24   19   16</p><p>Regardless of what number actually *is* the numerator,<br/>as long they&apos;re all the same, the denominators will<br/>spell out the utonal proportion.</p><p>Now we simply divide the ratios as fractions (which is<br/>what they look like here anyway), and we obtain the<br/>otonal proportion 38:48:57.  That&apos;s a description of<br/>Paul&apos;s chord that you should easily recognize.  We see<br/>that it&apos;s made up of a middle note which is 38:48 [= 19:24]<br/>above the &apos;root&apos; (represented by 38), and a top note<br/>which is 38:57 [= 2:3] above the &apos;root&apos; and 48:57 [= 16:19]<br/>above the middle note.</p><p>What Paul presented to you is simply the utonal counterpart<br/>(which is actually a &apos;major&apos; chord) to the typical nondecimal<br/>&apos;minor&apos; chord, which is expressed otonally as 16:24:19.</p><p>You should be able to see the analogy between these two<br/>19-limit chords and the two 5-limit chords with which I<br/>began my explanation, the otonal &apos;major&apos; chord of 4:5:6 and<br/>utonal &apos;minor&apos; chord of 1/4:1/5:1/6.  But the relationships<br/>are reversed, because this 19-limit *odentity* (that is, otonal<br/>identity, ratio 19/16) sounds like a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;, while this<br/>19-limit *udentity* (utonal identity, ratio 24/19) sounds like<br/>a &apos;major 3rd&apos;.</p><p>The main point is that *any chord may be written as<br/>either an otonal or a utonal proportion*.  Usually<br/>one of them gives smaller numbers and that is the<br/>one normally used.  In some cases, for example a<br/>typical 5-limit &apos;minor 7th&apos; tetrad, either description<br/>gives the same numbers, so either one may be used.<br/>Also, there may be other reasons why the version with<br/>higher numbers would be chosen.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; Can someone whose math training ended at college algebra<br/>&gt; have a fighting chance of understanding? I hope this is<br/>&gt; simply a matter of form rather than of depth.</p><p>There&apos;s certainly hope for you.</p><p>My math training ended with difficult struggle to make<br/>a barely-passing grade of &apos;D&apos; in 11th-grade Algebra 2,<br/>and I&apos;ve been able to make it this far in tuning theory.</p><p>Regarding your questions about 27/16 and 45/32:</p><p>Daniel Wolf [TD 489.7] and Paul Erlich [TD 489.17] have<br/>both given responses that should help clarify, but if<br/>you&apos;re still mystified, it might help for you to understand<br/>prime-factor notation of ratios.  Try the original paper<br/>I wrote outlining my theory:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm</a></p><p>If we&apos;re assuming &apos;octave&apos;-equivalence, which is *almost*<br/>always the case, prime-factoring eliminates all the<br/>&apos;unnecessary&apos; powers of 2, which often are the cause for<br/>such large numbers.</p><p>45/32, eliminating all powers of 2, reduces to 9*5<br/>= 3^2 * 5^1.</p><p>27/16, eliminating all powers of 2, reduces to 3^3.</p><p>(The caret sign [^] means &apos;raised to the power of&apos;.)</p><p>Prime-factoring the ratios is how we lattice theorists<br/>determine where to put the ratios on our lattice diagrams.<br/>And the lattice diagrams make it very easy to see the<br/>numerical relationships that may not be immediately<br/>apparent from an examination of the numbers themselves.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
