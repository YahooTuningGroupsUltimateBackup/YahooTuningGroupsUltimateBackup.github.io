By contrast, just-intonation chords are much calmer, more passive;</p><p>you literally have to slow down to listen to them.  (As Terry Riley</p><p>says, Western music is fast because it&apos;s not in tune.) &lt;&lt;</p><p>        I agree with this whole-heartedly!  On our &quot;Six Degrees Of Tonality&quot;<br/>CD,  Enid Katahn performed the Mozart Fantasie in three tunings, (MT, WT, and<br/>ET).  Enid is a very consistant performer, her ability to control timing is<br/>nearly equal to the best drummers on Music row, which is quite high, no pun<br/>intended. (I once saw Kenny Malone do a jingle session.  After the first<br/>take, the producer told Kenny that it was 62 seconds long and he needed it to<br/>be exactly 1 minute.  Kenny counted it off and the second take came in at 60<br/>seconds!  this is art, but I digress).<br/>    Enid played the Mozart in MT and WT in 5&apos;54&quot; and 5&apos;53&quot;, respectively.<br/>Then she played the same piece in ET and guess what?  It came in at 5&apos;39 !!!<br/>She said it was probably because there was no reason to linger at any of the<br/>otherwise harmonious spots, but she had had no conscious feeling that it was<br/>going any faster.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Listening from the other side, I&apos;ve learned</p><p>to hear equal temperament music as a kind of aural caffeine, overly</p><p>busy and nervous-making.  If you&apos;re used to getting that kind of buzz</p><p>from music, you feel the lack of it as a deprivation when it&apos;s not there.&lt;&lt;</p><p>      After tuning ET for many years, I was amazed to hear it after a weekend<br/>of well-tempered music.  For the first time, I was able to recognize what ET<br/>actually sounded like, and &quot;buzzy and nervous&quot; were the first two thoughts to<br/>cross my mind.   It is a really cool sound, true, but edgy and sterile at the<br/>same time.</p><p>&gt; Far beyond the mere theoretical purity, playing in just intonation</p><p>for long periods sensitizes me to a myriad colors, and coming back to</p><p>the equal tempered world is like seeing everything click back into black</p><p>&gt; and white.  It&apos;s a disappointing readjustment.  Come to think of it,</p><p>&gt; maybe you shouldn&apos;t try just intonation - you&apos;ll become unfit to</p><p>live in the West, and have to move to India or Bali.&lt;&lt;</p><p>   There has been more than a few pianists tell me that they couldn&apos;t stand<br/>to have their pianos tuned back to ET after playing in a well-tempered<br/>tuning.  The words &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;uninspiring&quot; and &quot;colorless&quot; are often used.</p><p>&gt;  My beef is with the bland way in which European and American</p><p>&gt; musics are currently tuned.  In fact, before the 20th century,</p><p>European music had its own wonderful non-equal-tempered tunings, which</p><p>&gt; unfortunately we&apos;ve abandoned. &lt;&lt;</p><p>     Mine too.  I believe that the adoption of ET was due to instrument<br/>manufacturers and theorists, not musicians.  We got blinded by science and<br/>forgot the organic, emotional, viscereal, aspects of music.  Today&apos;s world is<br/>a world that suppresses public emotional displays. The audience member that<br/>is weeping in the concert hall is often seen as unstable, or not quite<br/>rational, even though the purpose of music is so often said to be to cause an<br/>emotional response, thus providing an emotional respite in a world of<br/>rationality.  A variety of interval sizes, with their various psycho/emotive<br/>properties, promotes these emotional responses in ways that the sameness  of<br/>ET cannot.<br/>   12 ET&apos;s days are numbered, though I don&apos;t know if the next step will be<br/>forward into increasing ET&apos;s or backwards to the tunings of the 17,18,19th<br/>centuries.  Since I am dealing with the instruments of the past, I favor the<br/>latter.  It allows me to enlist the help of Ludwig, Amadeus, Franz etal. in<br/>changing the way the world listens to harmony.
