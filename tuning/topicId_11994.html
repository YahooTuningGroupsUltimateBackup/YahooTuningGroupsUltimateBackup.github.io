I&apos;ve been working on some ideas, but have<br/>&gt; nothing concrete to offer as yet.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Robin,</p><p>You describe where I&apos;m at. I&apos;m still in the process of committing<br/>myself to buying a 31tet guitar (I&apos;m a guitarist, if interested see<br/><a href="http://www.microtones.com">www.microtones.com</a>. We used to have their neck-builder on this list and he&apos;ll<br/>do other custom work if you wanted a guitar but didn&apos;t want a G&amp;L).</p><p>Regarding scales, I have a C program which dumps out scales given various<br/>constraints. For instance, if you wanted all scales where the size of &apos;second&apos;<br/>was constrained to between 2 and 7 &apos;chroma&apos;, or all scales where all fourths<br/>are within IV and IV# (and fifths wthin V and Vb). CUrrently there is no<br/>user-interface to speak of, and its a Unix program. In other words, I change<br/>parameters, recompile, and I&apos;m off and running.</p><p>The main aural experiments I&apos;ve done so far have been with 12-out-of-31<br/>tuning tables. If you play diatonic music that stays in close areas of<br/>the circle of fifths it is quite beautiful (which describes all that<br/>pre-Romantic musc that works great in 1/4 comma meantone). The inclusion<br/>of good septimal approximations is a natural fit to to blues and jazz<br/>playing (where I&apos;m coming from), and there are a lot of other &apos;neutral&apos;<br/>and &apos;11&apos; area intervals that look like a rich palette.</p><p>Unfortunately, the tuning table approach limits your ability to explore<br/>these and many other parts of the scale.</p><p>Recently I&apos;ve been looking at approximations to other ets. Some of these<br/>may be interesting systems to experiment with, even if poor approximations<br/>of the et in question. For instance,</p><p>3tet : 10 10 11        [ 5/4 ... 9/7 ]<br/>4tet : 8  8  8  7        [ 6/5 ... 7/6 ]<br/>5tet : 6  6  6  6  7       [ 8/7 ... 7/6 ]<br/>6tet : 5  5  5  5  5  6      [ 9/8 ... 8/7 ]<br/>7tet : 4  5  4  5  4  5  4     [ 12/11? 9/8 ... ]<br/>8tet : 4  4  4  4  4  4  4  3    [ 12/11 ... 16/15? ]<br/>9tet : 3  4  3  4  3  4  3  4  3<br/>10tet: 3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  4<br/>11tet: 3  3  3  3  3  2  3  3  3  3  2   [ ... 25/24? ]</p><p>These are all transposable systems, in that there is a suitable, single,<br/># or b available that will rotate the the intervals (convert to a different<br/>mode). I can&apos;t say anything about the musical usefulness of this, and even<br/>with a guitar, much of this is unexploreable. So the other option I&apos;ve been<br/>considering is to go to CSound or use some available scripts or write<br/>code to explore this in MIDI via pitchbends.</p><p>Keep your ideas on the list, there are enough people here who are<br/>knowledgeable and/or interested!</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
