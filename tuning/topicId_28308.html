I<br/>agree that the appeal of 4:5:6:7 is not and should not be dependent<br/>on WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW about historical practice. On the other<br/>hand, neither is it conditioned by modern common practice.<br/>Additionally, I do not go even as far as agreeing with the apparently<br/>fairly general concensus here that the low 7ths of 7-limit in<br/>dominant 7th chords are always, even in a cappella vocal contexts,<br/>&quot;inauthentic&quot; in, let us say Renaissance music or early baroque.</p><p>I do NOT believe that what composers wrote about and did consciously<br/>in their tuning and tuning preferences with keyboards always and<br/>inevitably reflects accurately the practices in performing a cappella<br/>vocal works or other ensembles not tied to some temperament or fixed<br/>tuning; not any more than it does today!</p><p>I have observed that innocent, not terribly talented or even musical<br/>ears can be trained to prefer the simple just intervals, namely<br/>fifths, fourths, and major thirds. Then quite without any training in<br/>this new harmonic context those same ears will spontaneously<br/>gravitate, given a sustained chord with plenty of time, toward the<br/>low 7-limit version of the 7th in V7.</p><p>I believe this is because, given sufficient opportunity, the human<br/>ear seeks out the simplest overall pattern of relationships rather<br/>the simplest ratios between any two specific tones in triads and in<br/>the more complex chords. I don&apos;t have any reason to believe this is a<br/>peculiarity of the 21st or late 20th centuries, since whatever<br/>previous exposure my subjects (members of my choir) have had to<br/>tunings has been 12-tET and the horrible distortions of it made<br/>available by entropy and lengthy periods of time between tunings.</p><p>However, even I do not pretend that such a seventh appearing as a<br/>passing tone of brief duration over a dominant triad would suddenly<br/>and reliably veer off the beaten track of its normal diatonic<br/>position pitchwise to comply with the 7-limit version.

Here you have the notorious syntonic comma problem built in,<br/>forcing some kind of tradeoff between perfect fourths and fifths, and<br/>the thirds. You have no choice. They can&apos;t all be just.</p><p>So 1/4-comma meantone gives perfect thirds, but fifths compromised by<br/>-5.4 cents. 12-tET gives almost perfect fifths (-2.0 cents) and<br/>heavily compromised thirds (M3 +13.7 cents). We have a range of<br/>choices between these two extremes.</p><p>So the point here is that the human ear will seek an optimum<br/>compromise that represents maximum tonal coherence. I would like to<br/>posit here that the first principle behind the appeal of harmony to<br/>the human ear and psyche is that they seek and savor maximum tonal<br/>coherence. In the case of CEGAD, the compromise will be located<br/>somewhere along a continuum that trades off thirds and fifths against<br/>each other.</p><p>We can productively view all the variants on 1/4-comma meantone as<br/>modifications of it that only partially rather than fully distribute<br/>the comma on the major third to the fifths. As the distribution<br/>becomes increasingly partial (e.g., 1/6-comma instead of 1/4), less<br/>of the comma is distributed to the fifths, the major third going<br/>increasingly sharp and the fifths becoming less compromised on the<br/>flat side.</p><p>If we continue far enough in this direction, we will eventually end<br/>up at 12-tET and a closed cycle of fifths instead of the open cycle<br/>of all the meantone variants (excluding the 31-tET closed cycle of 31<br/>fifths if we regard this temperament as equivalent to 1/4-comma<br/>meantone). There should be some optimimum compromise along the<br/>continuum between these two extremes (representing maximum harmonic<br/>coherence = minimum harmonic entropy) that the human ear will tend to<br/>prefer when executing CEGAD.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2001 2:30:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt; Bob had said:<br/>&gt; I believe this is because, given sufficient opportunity, the human<br/>&gt; ear seeks out the simplest overall pattern of relationships rather<br/>&gt; the simplest ratios between any two specific tones in triads and in<br/>&gt; &gt; the more complex chords.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Paul replied:<br/>&gt; &gt; Even in chords like CEGAD?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Bob answers:<br/>&gt; Yes.

Here you have the notorious syntonic comma<br/>&gt; problem built in,<br/>&gt; forcing some kind of tradeoff between perfect<br/>&gt; fourths and fifths, and<br/>&gt; the thirds. You have no choice. They can&apos;t all be<br/>&gt; just.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So 1/4-comma meantone gives perfect thirds, but<br/>&gt; fifths compromised by<br/>&gt; -5.4 cents. 12-tET gives almost perfect fifths (-2.0<br/>&gt; cents) and<br/>&gt; heavily compromised thirds (M3 +13.7 cents). We have<br/>&gt; a range of<br/>&gt; choices between these two extremes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the point here is that the human ear will seek an<br/>&gt; optimum<br/>&gt; compromise that represents maximum tonal coherence.<br/>&gt; I would like to<br/>&gt; posit here that the first principle behind the<br/>&gt; appeal of harmony to<br/>&gt; the human ear and psyche is that they seek and savor<br/>&gt; maximum tonal<br/>&gt; coherence. In the case of CEGAD, the compromise will<br/>&gt; be located<br/>&gt; somewhere along a continuum that trades off thirds<br/>&gt; and fifths against<br/>&gt; each other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can productively view all the variants on<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone as<br/>&gt; modifications of it that only partially rather than<br/>&gt; fully distribute<br/>&gt; the comma on the major third to the fifths. As the<br/>&gt; distribution<br/>&gt; becomes increasingly partial (e.g., 1/6-comma<br/>&gt; instead of 1/4), less<br/>&gt; of the comma is distributed to the fifths, the major<br/>&gt; third going<br/>&gt; increasingly sharp and the fifths becoming less<br/>&gt; compromised on the<br/>&gt; flat side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we continue far enough in this direction, we will<br/>&gt; eventually end<br/>&gt; up at 12-tET and a closed cycle of fifths instead of<br/>&gt; the open cycle<br/>&gt; of all the meantone variants (excluding the 31-tET<br/>&gt; closed cycle of 31<br/>&gt; fifths if we regard this temperament as equivalent<br/>&gt; to 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; meantone). There should be some optimimum compromise<br/>&gt; along the<br/>&gt; continuum between these two extremes (representing<br/>&gt; maximum harmonic<br/>&gt; coherence = minimum harmonic entropy) that the human<br/>&gt; ear will tend to<br/>&gt; prefer when executing CEGAD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>___________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!? -- Un e-mail gratuit <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.fr !<br/>Yahoo!

Most for the 12-tET, of<br/>&gt; course...</p><p>This leads me to believe that there was some corruption going on with my<br/>download. The 4:5:6:7 example consisted of a raucous and raspy root, a light<br/>fifth, a nearly inaudible third and there wasn&apos;t a seventh within earshot.<br/>Clearly, Joe and I were hearing different sounds--and I don&apos;t mean<br/>subjectively.</p><p>(5 minute pause to re-download the example.)</p><p>Just as I suspected.

If you remember, I expressed<br/>much enthusiasm for your Jerry0 (which I now believe is JI). Believe me, the<br/>example I listened to wasn&apos;t anything close to that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think this may support my contention that 4:5:6:7 is *not* what<br/>&gt; most people like to hear in the context of common-practice, western,<br/>&gt; diatonic music.</p><p>Does this mean you are &quot;championing&quot; that point of view, Paul? (Just<br/>kidding.)</p><p>&gt; since that&apos;s the context that jerry works in, more so<br/>&gt; than joseph pehrson or david beardsley, at least . . .</p><p>That&apos;s assuming Jerry *knows* what he&apos;s working in. :-) Remember, that&apos;s why<br/>he showed up here in the first place--because he had doubts. Come to think<br/>of it, he left that way, too. What I&apos;m trying to figure out is why did he<br/>come back here anyway?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; note also that jerry really liked the 22-equal chord, where the<br/>&gt; tritone is, strangely enough for jerry, exactly 600 cents . . .</p><p>So?

I think you would agree (had you been able to<br/>hear what I was hearing) that there was little in common between this V7 and<br/>the 4:5:6:7 example I was listening to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i really think, as i have all along (how convenient for me to say<br/>&gt; this now), that it&apos;s really a *scalar* phenomenon rather than a<br/>&gt; *vertical* one (perhaps i go a bit brainwashed by forte&apos;s _tonal<br/>&gt; harmony_?</p><p>I taught from that book back in 1970. I don&sup1;t remember any discussion of<br/>flexible tuning. (But then, 32 years is 32 years.)</p><p>&gt; well, it sure is convincing). the *vertical* phenomena are<br/>&gt; the triads, but the *scalar* template seems to be the more important<br/>&gt; phenomenon (just about every culture in the world uses *some* scalar<br/>&gt; template for any given segment of music, usually with four to nine<br/>&gt; tones per octave). then the dominant seventh chord invokes the<br/>&gt; *characterstic interval* within the diatonic scalar template, namely<br/>&gt; the tritone, which then sets up a powerful drive toward resolution<br/>&gt; (in contrary motion via semitones to notes of the tonic triad)<br/>&gt; *regardless of fine tuning*.</p><p>My god, Paul. You must have read my book! No? Then it must be you&apos;ve been<br/>listening to actual music composed and performed in the major/minor system.<br/>Yeah. That must be it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so in dave keenan&apos;s example, none of the *scale pitches* moves around<br/>&gt; by more than 9 cents, so the scalar template is fairly secure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; however, in the &apos;just 7-limit&apos; example, the fourth scale degree moves<br/>&gt; by 27 cents from the IV chord to the V7 chord. this is a large enough<br/>&gt; step to disturb the scalar template, it seems, and to disturb joseph<br/>&gt; and me when we listen to this progression.</p><p>I&apos;ll just have to find some hot a cappella sounds with &quot;flat&quot; sevenths in<br/>the melody line. Then we&apos;ll have something specific we can &quot;like&quot; or<br/>&quot;dislike.&quot;</p><p>I just flashed on a recording of an Indian folk song (alternately solo and<br/>unison group) sung over a tonic drone. I used it as an audio example in my<br/>book. It&apos;s melodic sevenths are so low my teachers would have &quot;corrected&quot;<br/>them for being flat. Not exactly the same as a V7 chord, but indicative that<br/>melody can and probably often does follow the leading of an acoustically<br/>sensitive ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jerry, though, likes this latter progression (though strangely he<br/>&gt; *dislikes* the 4:5:6:7 chord in isolation) . . . perhaps he had<br/>&gt; already decided he *should* like it in advance once he knew *what* he<br/>&gt; was going to be listening to . . . ????</p><p>I think we can forget this nonsense now.
