My<br/>emphasis was on &quot;How neat that this fits a 5-limit RI model!&quot; as if<br/>the model were the basis for the choice, rather than the ratio a<br/>convenient realization of an _aural_ judgment.</p><p>In contrast, my tricomma tuning was a theoretical construct designed<br/>to solve a musical problem on a mathematical basis: &quot;Come up with a<br/>24-note Pythagorean tuning with both a 7-flavor and a 17-flavor.&quot;</p><p>Your experimental, directly interactive, &quot;intracompositional&quot; process<br/>of trying 7:6, adjusting by ear to 279 cents, and then fine-tuning to<br/>a 75:64 as a ratio at once satisfying to the ear and conceptually<br/>elegant, is something left out of my narrative -- which could easily<br/>be read to suggest that you set out in advance to emulate a 7-based<br/>ratio with a complex 5-limit approximation.</p><p>In any future reference to the 75:64 saga, I&apos;ll be careful to tell the<br/>full story, with much emphasis on the very audible process of<br/>&quot;fine-tuning&quot; in the best Aristoxenian manner.</p><p>As for small intervals, or more specifically those with not-so-small<br/>integer ratios, the monzisma at ~0.29 cents is larger than the kalisma,<br/>the difference between 32:25 and the 12544:9801 interval equal to a<br/>Pythagorean major third at 81:64 plus two 896:891 commas (the<br/>difference between this third and 14:11). The kalisma has a ratio of<br/>9801:9800, or ~0.1766 cents.</p><p>By the way, I wonder what might have happened had you chosen a<br/>different rational expression for your &quot;right-sounding&quot; 279 cents, for<br/>example 27:23 (~277.59 cents)? That ratio occurred to me by a certain<br/>free association as the fifth complement of the 23:18 which I enjoy<br/>quoting as an RI approximation for the regular major third of 17-tET<br/>-- that is, the size that the minor third _would_ have in 17-tET if<br/>the fifths were a pure 3:2.</p><p>The jots are interesting -- according to Scala, a kalisma at 9801:9800<br/>is about 4.431350 jots; although the monzisma apparently involves a<br/>rational ratio too large for my version of Scala for MS-DOS to report<br/>in integer form, it returns a size of about 7.334990 jots.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=22239 href="#22239">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2001 12:23:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22236.html#22236">/tuning/topicId_22236.html#22236</a></p><p>&gt; First, I would very much like to emphasize the importance<br/>&gt; of your point about choosing an interval varying somewhat<br/>&gt; from 7:6 _by ear_ for your composition _3+4_, and then,<br/>&gt; having settled on something around 279 cents, selecting<br/>&gt; 75:64 as a convenient ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, although I had read your account, my language<br/>&gt; neglects this very characteristic Aristoxenian touch --<br/>&gt; finding what sounds right, and then integrating it into<br/>&gt; the intonational structure.

(I did, however, try about a dozen various<br/>pitch-bend levels until settling on ~279 cents by ear.)</p><p>But in any case, 75/64 was much more an emulation of 19/16<br/>(a whopping ~22.93 cents higher) than it was of 7/6 (only<br/>~7.716 cents lower), which was what I found so surprising.</p><p>Your emphasis on my &quot;Aristoxenian&quot; aural experiments is<br/>fundamental: 7/6 just didn&apos;t sound right, even tho it<br/>was closer to the pitch I finally chose.  19/16, on the<br/>other hand, could have been pressed into service and it<br/>wouldn&apos;t have bothered my ears nearly as much.</p><p>I&apos;ve still not been able to explain why this worked as it did...</p><p>&gt; The jots are interesting -- according to Scala, a kalisma at<br/>&gt; 9801:9800 is about 4.431350 jots; although the monzisma<br/>&gt; apparently involves a rational ratio too large for my version<br/>&gt; of Scala for MS-DOS to report in integer form, it returns a<br/>&gt; size of about 7.334990 jots.</p><p>I used Microsoft Excel and got 7.334990057 jots for the monzisma.<br/>Not quite sure what the limits of rounding error are in Excel,<br/>but I&apos;d say that that&apos;s a close match to Scala&apos;s value.</p><p>Note that Sauveur&apos;s &quot;heptamerides&quot; of 2^(1/301) are related<br/>to the &quot;jots&quot;, being simply a less accurate rounding.  Saveur<br/>chose this measurement partly because he also used &quot;merides&quot;<br/>of 2^(1/43), and 7 * 43 = 301, so both of his units divided<br/>evenly.</p><p>The &quot;savart&quot; was originally identical to this, but was later<br/>&quot;rationalized&quot; to be 2^(1/300).  Since the savart used to be<br/>commonly used to indicate interval sizes in Indian music-theory,<br/>this is yet one more complication to the endeavor to discover<br/>exactly what srutis really mean in terms of intonation.</p><p>(Many thanks to John Chalmers for clarifying the history of<br/>savarts.)</p><p>Another small interval that I find really interesting is<br/>W.S.B. Woolhouse&apos;s 2^(1/730), or a division of 730-EDO,<br/>which he used as his division of the virtual pitch continuum,<br/>his analogy of &quot;cents&quot;.</p><p>Woolhouse never gave this interval a name, so I can only<br/>refer to it by its formula (unless I coin a term for it...<br/>...a woolhousma?).  2^(1/730) is ~1.643835616 cents<br/>or ~41.2369863 jots.</p><p>He chose 730-EDO because it gave amazingly close integer<br/>approximations to all of the important JI intervals he was<br/>analyzing and using in his calculations.
