In geometrical form, all the numbers of any scale or magnitude of size always get reduced to the musical intervals.  That was the essence of Einstein&apos;s Relativity Theory.  That it is better to reduce everything to geometrical ideas.  It&apos;s in the Guy Murchie book I mentioned above.  You have to divide those rather big numbers into the ratios that produce them.  Its always comes out to Pythagorus&apos; ratios.</p><p>Sorry, but that paragraph reads like a series of unrelated sentences to me.  I&apos;m confused.  Are you saying that E=mc2 is a musical formula?  How in the world does Bode&apos;s Law relate to Pythagorean ratios?</p><p>Can you please explain how to reduce the Bode&apos;s Law series into geometrical form in such a way as to arrive at musically meaningful ratios?  I did an experiment once where I took the planetary distances (in mean millions of miles) and reduced them to their simple ratios.  Then I generated tones (sustained, with weak harmonic overtones) within human hearing range at frequencies with the same set of ratios (not easy to do, since it spans almost the whole range!), and played them together in series and as &quot;chords.&quot;  It sounded like crap.  So I tried it with the theoretical Bode&apos;s Law series itself.  That also sounded like crap.  I could perceive no musical value, nothing remotely resembling anything that could conceivably be<br/>construed as a musical scale.  To quote Homer Simpson, it sounded like &quot;just a bunch of stupid stuff that happened.&quot;  Meaningless chaos.  Where did I go wrong?  Where is the legendary music of the spheres?</p><p>--<br/>David J.

That was my recollection of something that I had either read or heard in a lecture probably between thirty-five and forty-five years ago.  Digging out that reference or my lecture notes simply didn&apos;t have a high priority for me.  However, now I have received back from a colleague my set of Carl Sagan&apos;s videos and book, &quot;Cosmos&quot;, after having these on loan for over three years.  Although the book doesn&apos;t list Bode (or Titius) in its index (probably a good indication of the slight regard for his &quot;law&quot; among contemporary astronomers), there is a section on Kepler, particularly pages 43 through 51.  His realization that the orbits were not circular and that there were satellites which did not fit this scheme apparently led to his grudging acceptance that God had not set up the solar system on the basis of solid geometry (The Cosmic Mystery).  Eventually, after Tycho Brahe died and his observations became available to Kepler, he figured out that the orbits were elliptical and the result was his third or harmonic law:  the squares of the periods of revolution are proportional to the cubes of the average distances from the sun.  He then went on to relate these to musical tones  (Sagan does not go into the math about that).</p></div>
