We are<br/>&gt; &gt; trying to pinpoint the theoretically correct explanation of unison here<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; applies to all ideal conditions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And never mind the minute variations that do not in the least affect our<br/>&gt; &gt; conception. Glaring errors by any two musicians trying to sound a unison<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; not the fault of the unison.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s exactly what I&apos;m saying!  Except for this: unison is a word.  If we<br/>have two different<br/>&gt; definitions, then we can figure out if we are explaining two different<br/>things.  If so, we need<br/>&gt; two different terms.  It&apos;s just for communication.  In other words, there<br/>is absolutely no<br/>&gt; reason that two people, each descibing a different idea should either one<br/>care what word<br/>&gt; is used to describe it, as long as they both end up with a way to<br/>communicate their unique<br/>&gt; ideas.  So there&apos;s no reason to argue.  Just work together to clarify<br/>meaning so we all have<br/>&gt; useful words.  If &quot;unison&quot; alone doesn&apos;t express to me what you mean,<br/>don&apos;t try to tell me<br/>&gt; that you&apos;ve changed the definition of unison, unless everyone has agreed<br/>to use that<br/>&gt; change.  Because it&apos;s all about communication, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wasn&apos;t saying unison involves those performance issues, I was saying<br/>that if those are<br/>&gt; factors in our musical discussion, we need words to define the difference<br/>between<br/>&gt; perceptions based on those things and the other perceptions we&apos;re talking<br/>about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Emotional does not equal perceptual.  And if you are claiming that words<br/>like unison or<br/>&gt; even the idea behind them even exist without perception, I have to<br/>disagree.  Unisons did<br/>&gt; not exist before people.  Unison is an idea.  Not a reality.  Well- that<br/>is unless we define<br/>&gt; unison as simply the existence of identical frequency waves coming from<br/>discreet sources<br/>&gt; at the same moment in time.  But if that&apos;s all it is, then what&apos;s with the<br/>big discussion?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

It is a case<br/>of exactly what I&apos;m talking about: using names and<br/>words instead of reality to prove a point.  Just<br/>because we use the same letter name, doesn&apos;t mean<br/>it is the same note.  However, there&apos;s obviously<br/>a real idea behind it that is based on actual<br/>perception.</p><p>So rather than argue with people about how you can&apos;t<br/>invert a unison, I&apos;d try to say, yeah, you&apos;re point<br/>about octave-inverted large intervals resolving to<br/>unisons versus octaves is a good point.  Here&apos;s a<br/>better way I&apos;d suggest to talk about it though...</p><p>And if there&apos;s confusion, we can point out why<br/>discussing inversion of unison is confusing<br/>or how it keeps the thinking in an artificial<br/>box, not open to all the possibilities of musical<br/>understanding.</p><p>I think that it isn&apos;t &quot;unison&quot; that is the problem,<br/>it&apos;s the word &quot;inversion&quot; and how that isn&apos;t clear.<br/>There&apos;s the implication usually that we&apos;re talking<br/>about octave based inversion.  But that isn&apos;t always<br/>specified.  So what are we really talking about?<br/>This leads to discussion about the significance of<br/>octaves.  I think that is useful discussion.  It&apos;s<br/>important in my mind to pin-down what it is about<br/>the octave that we&apos;re valuing and perceiving.  It&apos;s<br/>a long and interesting discussion, so I won&apos;t start<br/>into that.</p><p>If we can identify more clearly and precisely what<br/>the perception is that we&apos;re identifying with the<br/>word &quot;interval&quot; and the word &quot;inversion&quot; then maybe<br/>we could agree that if we apply a similar perceptual<br/>event to a unison it will become an octave.  If so,<br/>then maybe we&apos;ll end up accepting that the term<br/>&quot;inversion,&quot; while clearly illogical to apply to a<br/>unison, is in fact the easiest way to relate the<br/>unison vs. octave perception in this context (though<br/>I don&apos;t like those sorts of compromises that use<br/>such illogical confusing language, they are a fact<br/>of language, and sometimes we do compromise).  On the<br/>other hand, maybe with discussion, we will discover<br/>that the perception we&apos;re talking about with &quot;interval&quot;<br/>and &quot;inversion&quot; doesn&apos;t actually apply to unisons,<br/>and then we could clear say that unisons don&apos;t exhibit<br/>the behaviour of the other intervals in these regards.</p><p>This is all obviously somewhat subjective.</p><p>My overall point being that rather than try to argue<br/>about which boxes everything belongs in, we should<br/>use every point of confusion like this as an<br/>opportunity to clarify what it that we&apos;re really<br/>talking about.  If inversion is only a name for<br/>something people saw patterns of in notation, then<br/>that&apos;s not very significant or applicable.  That<br/>would be like the idea I mentioned where people<br/>see patterns like &quot;oh, I see, chords are every other<br/>note in a scale.&quot;  If we apply patterns like that<br/>to everything, it really isn&apos;t appropriate.  I&apos;m glad<br/>that I understand why and how chords really come to<br/>be.  My sense is that inversions and octaves also<br/>relate to real perceptual phenomena.  Whether these<br/>perceptions also apply to unisons isn&apos;t clear to me,<br/>especially when we use words like &quot;inversion&quot; which<br/>absolutely doesn&apos;t, as a *word*, apply to the idea<br/>of unison.</p><p>Ok, so we recognize silly innapropriate words.<br/>Fine.  Instead of arguing about it, everyone needs to:</p><p>1. accept and admit that those words are illogical<br/>to apply to this circumstance</p><p>2. Figure out with other ways what we&apos;re really talking<br/>about</p><p>3. Decide if it will be best to compromise and accept<br/>the illogical words or rather come up with new words<br/>or clarify or modify definitions.</p><p>This is like the idea that musicians use ordinal names:<br/>major second, perfect FIFTH, and also cardinal names:<br/>I-IV-V (one-four-five) but it&apos;s all confusing and weird.<br/>See we say that ONE step away is an interval of a SECOND.<br/>That&apos;s ridiculous.

It is a case<br/>&gt; of exactly what I&apos;m talking about: using names and<br/>&gt; words instead of reality to prove a point.  Just<br/>&gt; because we use the same letter name, doesn&apos;t mean<br/>&gt; it is the same note.  However, there&apos;s obviously<br/>&gt; a real idea behind it that is based on actual<br/>&gt; perception.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So rather than argue with people about how you can&apos;t<br/>&gt; invert a unison, I&apos;d try to say, yeah, you&apos;re point<br/>&gt; about octave-inverted large intervals resolving to<br/>&gt; unisons versus octaves is a good point.  Here&apos;s a<br/>&gt; better way I&apos;d suggest to talk about it though...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if there&apos;s confusion, we can point out why<br/>&gt; discussing inversion of unison is confusing<br/>&gt; or how it keeps the thinking in an artificial<br/>&gt; box, not open to all the possibilities of musical<br/>&gt; understanding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that it isn&apos;t &quot;unison&quot; that is the problem,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s the word &quot;inversion&quot; and how that isn&apos;t clear.<br/>&gt; There&apos;s the implication usually that we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; about octave based inversion.  But that isn&apos;t always<br/>&gt; specified.  So what are we really talking about?<br/>&gt; This leads to discussion about the significance of<br/>&gt; octaves.  I think that is useful discussion.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; important in my mind to pin-down what it is about<br/>&gt; the octave that we&apos;re valuing and perceiving.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; a long and interesting discussion, so I won&apos;t start<br/>&gt; into that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we can identify more clearly and precisely what<br/>&gt; the perception is that we&apos;re identifying with the<br/>&gt; word &quot;interval&quot; and the word &quot;inversion&quot; then maybe<br/>&gt; we could agree that if we apply a similar perceptual<br/>&gt; event to a unison it will become an octave.  If so,<br/>&gt; then maybe we&apos;ll end up accepting that the term<br/>&gt; &quot;inversion,&quot; while clearly illogical to apply to a<br/>&gt; unison, is in fact the easiest way to relate the<br/>&gt; unison vs. octave perception in this context (though<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t like those sorts of compromises that use<br/>&gt; such illogical confusing language, they are a fact<br/>&gt; of language, and sometimes we do compromise).  On the<br/>&gt; other hand, maybe with discussion, we will discover<br/>&gt; that the perception we&apos;re talking about with &quot;interval&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;inversion&quot; doesn&apos;t actually apply to unisons,<br/>&gt; and then we could clear say that unisons don&apos;t exhibit<br/>&gt; the behaviour of the other intervals in these regards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is all obviously somewhat subjective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My overall point being that rather than try to argue<br/>&gt; about which boxes everything belongs in, we should<br/>&gt; use every point of confusion like this as an<br/>&gt; opportunity to clarify what it that we&apos;re really<br/>&gt; talking about.  If inversion is only a name for<br/>&gt; something people saw patterns of in notation, then<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not very significant or applicable.  That<br/>&gt; would be like the idea I mentioned where people<br/>&gt; see patterns like &quot;oh, I see, chords are every other<br/>&gt; note in a scale.&quot;  If we apply patterns like that<br/>&gt; to everything, it really isn&apos;t appropriate.  I&apos;m glad<br/>&gt; that I understand why and how chords really come to<br/>&gt; be.  My sense is that inversions and octaves also<br/>&gt; relate to real perceptual phenomena.  Whether these<br/>&gt; perceptions also apply to unisons isn&apos;t clear to me,<br/>&gt; especially when we use words like &quot;inversion&quot; which<br/>&gt; absolutely doesn&apos;t, as a *word*, apply to the idea<br/>&gt; of unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, so we recognize silly innapropriate words.<br/>&gt; Fine.  Instead of arguing about it, everyone needs to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. accept and admit that those words are illogical<br/>&gt; to apply to this circumstance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. Figure out with other ways what we&apos;re really talking<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. Decide if it will be best to compromise and accept<br/>&gt; the illogical words or rather come up with new words<br/>&gt; or clarify or modify definitions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is like the idea that musicians use ordinal names:<br/>&gt; major second, perfect FIFTH, and also cardinal names:<br/>&gt; I-IV-V (one-four-five) but it&apos;s all confusing and weird.<br/>&gt; See we say that ONE step away is an interval of a SECOND.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s ridiculous.  Every beginning student in the world<br/>&gt; gets confused at first about this.

It is!):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. by subtracting its scale degree number from<br/>&gt; that of the interval of inversion; or<br/>&gt; 2. by reflecting the scale degrees about a (real<br/>&gt; or imagined) midpoint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both methods result in the self-same pitches.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&grave;Reflection&grave; seems to be a term more suitable, seeing as inversion has many<br/>confounded meanings in music theory.</p><p>Ok, so you can &grave;reflect&grave; any PITCH in relation to a midpoint by the<br/>&grave;interval of inversion&grave;. That will yield either another interval, but not a<br/>unison. How about that?</p><p>Note: I like Dave Keenan&apos;s method of considering the fraction sign when<br/>typing ratios to denote pitches (relative frequencies) not intervals. He<br/>assigns the colon sign for the intervals.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also see no _lgical_ reason to reject calling a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; unison between two parts an interval.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Between a lower and an upper pitch. This certainly does not apply to<br/>&gt; unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s your view, and you&apos;re welcome to it.<br/>&gt; But personally, I enjoy the added convenience<br/>&gt; of being able to call all intervals &quot;intervals&quot;,<br/>&gt; and not having to contstantly make special<br/>&gt; mention of unison when no exceptions apply<br/>&gt; to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;It looks like an interval; it sounds like an<br/>&gt; interval; it behaves like an interval; ... it IS<br/>&gt; an interval!&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>As you like.</p><p>&gt; In much the same way, really, Oz, you ought<br/>&gt; to accept that the whole world calls zero a<br/>&gt; number because it works better that way.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I never said anything to the contrary. Zero just denotes the absence of<br/>whatever is being counted in the world of integers.</p><p>&gt; Are you forgetting that Baghdad taught<br/>&gt; Europe the conept of zero as a number and<br/>&gt; a great convenience in counting, since it<br/>&gt; enables place notation?  That was in, let me<br/>&gt; see, the XIIIth century or so ...<br/>&gt;</p><p>I very well remember the Mutezilite contributions to European Renaissance,<br/>especially in mathematics, geometry and physics.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as is so often the case, applying these logical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas to the creation of _music_ doesn&apos;t always result<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in something satisfying.  For example, when two parts<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cross by stepwise contrary or oblique motion, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; _logical_ interval<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; rendezvouz point, rather.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I said what I mean.  Please don&apos;t put words<br/>&gt; in my mouth.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t dare think of it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; between them at some point is most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; definitely a unison, although playing or singing that will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; often create an unmusical result, through the sudden<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thinning of the texture - probably due as much to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; loss of interaction of the upper partials of the two<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; notes as to the absence of a second fundamental in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mix.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; While discussing the logical idea of inversion (in any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval, commonly an octave), may I point out that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not vastly different from the logical idea of reflection<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; about the midpoint of that interval (commonly a tritone).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; eg inverting the diatonic melodic fragment:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; CDEE DEFF EFAG FGBA<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in its octave (at c) produces:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cBAA BAGG AGEF GFDE<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which is exactly the same result as reflecting it in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tritone at F#.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is a diatonical melodic inversion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I said so, didn&apos;t I?<br/>&gt;</p><p>So that would make F# the focal point for unison. Try reflecting or<br/>inverting that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where is the unison inverted?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did I say this example included one?</p><p>You pointed out the pitch of the &grave;tritone&grave; as the midpoint.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I&apos;m sure you are capable of extending this<br/>&gt; example to include a final note c in the melody,<br/>&gt; which will invert in the octave, naturally enough,<br/>&gt; to give C.</p><p>Let&apos;s pretend that I am not, and let&apos;s see you produce an example!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the first method, we invert the (note at the) _prime_<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C in the (interval) octave C-c to get the (note at the)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; octave c.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmmm, I notice that I&apos;m talking about the prime here<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (a note), rather than the unison (an interval).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You are trying to apply the principles of invertible counterpoint, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not at all.  I *am* applying them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Then why not give a concrete example from established composers such as<br/>Telemann, Handel or Bach?</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... which<br/>&gt; &gt; does not mean at all that the unison is an interval to begin with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nor was that my argument.  But it is one.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Nope.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the second method, we reflect the (note at the)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; _prime_ C in the midpoint of the (interval) octave C-c,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that is F#, 3 and a half scale degrees away, to get the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (note at the) octave c, 3 and a half scale degrees away<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the other side.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So what does the voices become?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You weren&apos;t paying attention!  Both methods<br/>&gt; lead to identical results.  Which is another<br/>&gt; reason I spelt them out for you above.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Nowhere did I see how the unison was inverted.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p></div>
