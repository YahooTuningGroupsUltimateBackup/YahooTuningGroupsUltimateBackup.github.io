Now I use an Excel workbook with several<br/>&gt; interlinking spreadsheets for my adaptive tuning work. In a nutshell,<br/>&gt; one sheet holds an imported MIDI file that has been converted to<br/>&gt; text. This sheet also provides a convenient place to specify key and<br/>&gt; transposition, if needed. Another sheet supplies tables of pitch<br/>&gt; class and equally tempered frequencies for the MIDI note numbers, and<br/>&gt; a third sheet supplies the ratios associated with the diatonic major<br/>&gt; and minor scales. These include only dominant-side ii (9/8) and vii<br/>&gt; (9/5). I haven&apos;t automated contextual tuning yet, so I have to<br/>&gt; hand-tune plagal-side ii (10/9) and vii (16/9) and dominant 7ths. The<br/>&gt; diatonic chords are mostly 5-limit, but dominant 7ths are 7-limit.<br/>&gt; Finally, yet another sheet is used as an export platform to Csound.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dear Patrick,</p><p>would you care to share your workbook?<br/>i would love to try it out.<br/>I am currently using t2mf as well but i am a bit of a foon when it comes to<br/>excel<br/>(though i can make a keen 3d pie chart! in a pinch.! :-)</p><p>cheers</p></div><h3><a id=11716 href="#11716">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Mullen wrote,</p><p>&gt;An aside: If I understand Partch correctly, my term &quot;dominant-side&quot;<br/>&gt;would be his otonal, while &quot;plagal-side&quot; (subdominant) would be<br/>&gt;utonal.</p><p>I don&apos;t think you&apos;ve understood Partch correctly. A major chord would be<br/>otonal whether dominant or subdominant, and a minor chord would be utonal<br/>whether dominant or subdominant.</p><p>&gt;But wait! There&apos;s more! There are several D&apos;s (I put the piece in<br/>&gt;A-minor for convenience) that start out as the root of IV but are<br/>&gt;held across a bar line to become the dom7 of V7. When playing such a<br/>&gt;note on my trumpet I will, as subtly as possible, flatten the D to<br/>&gt;suit it&apos;s new role. But the whole point of this excercise is to<br/>&gt;brutally follow wherever the pitch takes me, so in these instances I<br/>&gt;must RAISE the non-held pitches by 64/63 so the D-4/3 is a relative<br/>&gt;7/4 to the E! Yeehaw! The net result may well mean an overall<br/>&gt;sharpening of pitch throughout the piece, but it&apos;s a wash so far.<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll post more when I get it done...</p><p>I suggest you have a look at what John deLaubenfels&apos;s program does to this<br/>sequence, which to my ears is much more satisfactory than the sudden 81:80<br/>and 64:63 pitch-shifts you&apos;re proposing here, even while attaining<br/>essentially the same vertical sonorities (in the 7-limit version of his<br/>method).</p></div>
