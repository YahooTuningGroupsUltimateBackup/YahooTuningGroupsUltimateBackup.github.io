I believe that the research<br/>is very limited and much more work really needs to be done before we start drawing lines in<br/>the sand. I wish to take an example from a very unlikely source. Stockhausen&apos;s Hymnen. In the<br/>second region there is a chord that descend a tritone over quite a few minutes. On one level<br/>such things are not heard but &quot;felt&quot; which is exactly what Karl was up to. Few in the Lab<br/>would hear anything at all.<br/>    Much has been said as to how high a limit one can use. Let me point out that the Ancient<br/>Greeks far surpassed these limits. The method  in many cases was by the use of &quot;means&quot; or<br/>&quot;medients&quot;. The Persians also used high ratios in the same way. That various &quot;means&quot; where<br/>used along with limits is something we should not over look or cease to investigate.<br/>    Another point is that various intonation systems allow new&quot; structural&quot; possibilities. In<br/>the 1-3-7-9-11-15 eikosany we have 2 opposite notes the 1-7-9 and the 3-11-15 a 56/55 apart. A<br/>mere 31 cent interval. You could temper this out over the series of just intervals it would<br/>take you to get there, but it would not be the same. I am sure that Dan Wolf would agree with<br/>me that after working and hearing this structure a shift to one or the other expresses a leap<br/>beyond its ratio size and is heard as a &quot;structural&quot; leap.<br/>    Partch work with limits was an examination of the Lambdoma at its different size levels.<br/>For a great part the structural Possibilities is what attracted him to build instrument in<br/>this tuning. As Dan could also point out , he did not limit himself to this singular<br/>structural perspective. Many of his composition were based on ideas outside the diamond but<br/>could be done with a diamond master set. He knows more about this than me. As far as<br/>Practicality what is more impractical than his set of instruments! Art is not Practical,<br/>nuclear weapons as a deterrent are. Infinity is not so bad</p><p>    I agree with the cowboy &quot;Don&apos;t Fence me in!</p><p>Polychroni wrote:</p><p>&gt; As a sub-amateur in tuning, I&apos;d like to ask the following question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After having read the _JI Primer_, much is made out of the &quot;infinite&quot; tonal<br/>&gt; lattice.  But, clearly, their are limits, both physical and perceptional,<br/>&gt; on how fine an increment can be discerned.  And, since some intervals are<br/>&gt; indiscernible, it would seem that the _practically_ the lattice is finite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it reasonable to superimpose a &quot;discernability grid&quot; or a &quot;precision<br/>&gt; grid&quot;, or some other such grid, on top of the tonal lattice, thereby<br/>&gt; joining like-tones (hmm..., &apos;homotones&apos;?), into a finite, practical<br/>&gt; lattice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Polychroni Moniodis<br/>&gt; Ypsilanti, MI<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; eLerts<br/>&gt; It&apos;s Easy.

I  wanted<br/>to pointed out to Polychroni that there is a  breath of the situation that regardless of what<br/>decides to do personally these decisions are not universal, final or conclusive.

Erlich&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel that any composer should be free to draw the line anywhere she sees<br/>&gt; fit, based on her own perception of her compositional materials, her likely<br/>&gt; uses of duration, timbre, etc. The Fokker periodicity block formalism I<br/>&gt; pointed Polychroni to allows one to take any equivalences, whether as large<br/>&gt; as 31&iuml;&iquest;&half; or as small as a fraction of a cent, and construct a finite pitch<br/>&gt; system which mirrors the entire infinite lattice using only those<br/>&gt; equivalences. No one is saying that 31&iuml;&iquest;&half; or even much smaller intervals can&apos;t<br/>&gt; be perceived as structurally distant on the lattice if the composition uses<br/>&gt; them that way. At the same time, finity can open up compositional<br/>&gt; possibilities absent on the infinite lattice through the use of &quot;punning&quot; --<br/>&gt; at which point temperament and/or adaptive tuning become useful options. The<br/>&gt; commonest Western progressions rely on &quot;punning&quot; through the syntonic comma,<br/>&gt; an interval which in pure just intonation would come out to 21.5&iuml;&iquest;&half;. However,<br/>&gt; if one wrote a piece in just intonation in which the melodic interval of<br/>&gt; syntonic comma was a motivically emphasized feature, one could<br/>&gt; compositionally project it as a significant move in the harmonic lattice.<br/>&gt; These are not contradictions, they are merely alternate possibilities in the<br/>&gt; vast field of musical composition, and a demonstration that musical context<br/>&gt; is everything when dealing with these abstract &quot;lines in the sand&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
