Lattice diagrams are useful when<br/>&gt; trying to grasp _all_ the interrelationships within<br/>&gt; a scale.  The harmonic entropy concept can be applied<br/>&gt; to all those interrelationships, not just the ones<br/>&gt; formed with a single tonic. So if you were really going<br/>&gt; to derive a scale (for a type of music in which a<br/>&gt; lattice is relevant) from the harmonic entropy concept,<br/>&gt; you would not simply take the minima and construct them<br/>&gt; all upwards from a single tonic.</p><p>I was thinking when I made it that a lattice of the<br/>Harmonic Entropy minima was (for lack of a better word)<br/>irrelevant.  You confirmed it.</p><p>However, I did have the thought that a lattice would<br/>be useful for modelling Parncutt&apos;s &quot;tonalness&quot; concept.<br/>. . . ???</p><p>I&apos;ve always had a problem with the idea that the<br/>subharmonics/utonalities were exactly as valid as<br/>the harmonics/otonalities, and Parncutt&apos;s and Erlich&apos;s<br/>experiments seem to bear out the fact that *when we<br/>are considering more than 2 tones*,  the otonal<br/>perception is more pronounced.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say that utonalities are not valid<br/>musical resources, or that Partch&apos;s theories are<br/>wrong.  His utonal ideas are acoustically correct<br/>in terms of intervals of 2 notes.  I&apos;m just saying<br/>that I&apos;ve always thought that we tend to *hear*<br/>chords more as otonalities, even when they are<br/>a utonal series.</p><p>This relates to the &quot;inversionally similar&quot; chords<br/>I posted yesterday (actual they should be referred<br/>to as &quot;inversionally identical&quot;).  Perhaps utonalities<br/>that are most favored are the ones which are<br/>inversionally identical when described otonally.<br/>Has anyone ever investigated this property in<br/>chords before?</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=1576 href="#1576">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
