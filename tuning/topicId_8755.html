But I know you well enough (I think) that you wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;logically conclude from this that it must therefore explain the high third.</p><p>Of course. If the high third is at all based on an acoustical interaction<br/>between simultaneously sounding notes, as you suggest, there&apos;s no way it<br/>could be the Pythagorean third, since the numbers in the ratio (64:81) are<br/>way to high to &quot;do&quot; anything. However, a believer in a Pythagorean<br/>interpretation might claim that a series of piled-up fifths could easily<br/>influence a progression like I-III-VI-II-V-I; if the fifths in this<br/>progression are strong enough to influence the tuning of successive roots, a<br/>skilled musical ensemble would have to imagine them beforehand and tune the<br/>III according to a Pythagorean third relative to the I. It is a short step<br/>from there to believing that, conditioned by such progressions, the tuning<br/>of scale degree 3 is generally &quot;attracted&quot; to the Pythagorean third above<br/>the tonic. Certainly this would be a logical point of view for someone who,<br/>like yourself, believes that the major thirds of skilled performers often<br/>end up rather sharp of 4:5, and that this is not due to any influence on the<br/>part of 12-tET tunings of fixed-pitch instruments.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Anyway, Handel probably composed his<br/>&gt;&gt; choral works at the organ (or other keyboard) -- are you suggesting that<br/>the<br/>&gt;&gt; enharmonic relations in these works would naturally assume a reversed<br/>&gt;&gt; direction relative to how Handel heard them if performed by an<br/>unaccompanied<br/>&gt;&gt; choir?</p><p>&gt;No.</p><p>So G# is not higher than Ab for all kinds of music, is it?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m just suggesting that keyboard tuning was and is irrelevant to the<br/>&gt;way ears tend to tune music if left to their own devices.</p><p>I think you have to look beyond your concept of a universal &quot;music&quot; to<br/>specific styles and compositions and the type of tuning issues involved in<br/>each of them, both in their creation and their subsequent realization. Also<br/>you should be more cognizant of the degree to which music is a cultural<br/>&quot;game&quot;, and the how meaning of music for us is so strongly dependent on our<br/>previous experiences with it and the associations it carries.</p><p>&gt;Very likely,<br/>&gt;&quot;mistuned&quot; keyboards in Handel&apos;s day were a bane to vocal tuning, just as<br/>&gt;they are today.</p><p>As far as we know, the pure thirds and low leading tones of meantone tuning<br/>were most comfortable for the singers of the time.</p><p>More on nature vs. nurture:</p><p>In Arabic music, the minor third is divided melodically into two nearly<br/>equal neutral seconds (go listen to some Arabic music and you&apos;ll hear this).<br/>This is a most natural thing for Arabic musicians to sing and they sing it<br/>without thought. Now you try it. Unless you&apos;ve listened to a lot of Arabic<br/>music, you&apos;ll probably find this impossible to do. Why? Are our brains,<br/>ears, or throats structured differently from those of Arabic musicians? Of<br/>course not. It&apos;s just that we&apos;ve never _experienced_ this, having listened<br/>to lullabies, symphonies, and other musical events _with cultural meaning_<br/>in diatonic scales all our lives. What is this new experience? It&apos;s got to<br/>be a mistake, an unskilled amateur trying to sing, right? At first, that&apos;s<br/>what it sounds like. But once we&apos;ve heard this phenomenon enough times, our<br/>brain begins to characterize it as something distinct, something meaningful,<br/>with its own quality, until it finally sounds like a real musical phrase.<br/>Once one hears it this way, it immediately becomes _far_ easier to sing<br/>(this happened to me). In the context of Arabic music, which has no triadic<br/>or functional harmony, this is undoubtedly the _right_ thing to sing,<br/>whether there is instrumental backing or not. The musical motifs of the<br/>maqamat have their own structural logic that _coevolved_ with the tuning<br/>they use. Tuning and style are intimately intertwined and one cannot make<br/>judgments of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in one independently of the other.</p></div>
