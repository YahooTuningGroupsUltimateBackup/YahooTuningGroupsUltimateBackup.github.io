My only comment is on this:</p><p>&gt;5LJI (5-Limit Just Intonation):<br/>&gt;The Comma digits used here show the values that the subsequent Meantone<br/>Temperament &gt;attempts to approximate.</p><p>There is no single 5-limit JI system that meantone attempts to approximate<br/>-- rather, it approximates a larger set of JI relationships than any single<br/>JI system could achieve. A reasonable simplification would be that meantone<br/>simultaneously approximates several JI systems. &quot;Approximation&quot; in this<br/>sense should be evaluted not on a pitch-by-pitch, but on a consonant<br/>interval-by-consonant interval basis.</p><p>Also, I noticed that the 5-limit system you do propose is not one of the<br/>&quot;famous&quot; ones, though any of the latter would suffer the same problem. Out<br/>of curiousity, where does your 5-limit system come from?</p></div>
