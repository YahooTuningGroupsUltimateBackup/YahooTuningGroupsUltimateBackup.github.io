Since the main rhythmic pulse (in the solo) is sort of a Bo Diddley funk, but with 19 beats/measure, I find the swing analogy amusing. And the title came from a time in the early 1970&apos;s...I had just heard Captain Beefheart&apos;s famous phrase..&quot;A squid eating dough in a polyethylene bag is fast and bulbous...got me?&quot; And because of that (plus some interesting internal voyages I had been taking), I started thinking of squids a lot...and the title refers to actual squids one can eat; they look sort of like Eggo waffles, but with an eye and small tentacles at the bottom. And, I do indeed eat a lot of squid these days at a local Japanese restaurant (if in Denver, it&apos;s Taki&apos;s on Logan/Colfax)...best to all..Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=57746 href="#57746">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2005 6:31:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;   Hey Carl...if I knew what the Dixieland One Step was, I might know<br/>&gt;if Breakfast Squids was related...</p><p>:)</p><p>It turns out I was wrong...
