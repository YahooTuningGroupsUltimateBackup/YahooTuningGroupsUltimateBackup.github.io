But ... my fingers are still itching for this, and I<br/>have a brief period -- about a month -- before I rotate hobbies again<br/>and spend three weeks in Neuro-Semantics land<br/>(<a href="http://www.neurosemantics.com/Training/2002_International_Conference">http://www.neurosemantics.com/Training/2002_International_Conference</a>.<br/>htm if you&apos;re interested in that sort of thing).</p><p>Sooo ... what am I up to?</p><p>1. I&apos;m expanding the code that produced &quot;When Harry Met Iannis&quot;<br/>(<a href="http://www.borasky-research.net/HarryIannis.htm">www.borasky-research.net/HarryIannis.htm</a>)in an attempt to make the<br/>resulting music more interesting. I&apos;m going to add a random volume<br/>level to the random walk and I&apos;m going to expand the chord space to<br/>the 13-limit tonality diamond.</p><p>2. I&apos;m trying to get the rights to port David Cope&apos;s LISP-based<br/>algorithmic analysis and composition software to Linux. As far as I<br/>know it currently only works on Macs, and the CDs that come with his<br/>books containing all that wonderful source code are unreadable on my<br/>Windows box.</p><p>3. I think there&apos;s finally an open-source driver for my sound card<br/>for Linux, so I may finally be able to get rid of the Windows 2000<br/>partition on my big system.</p><p>4. I&apos;m looking to code up ancient Hebrew, Sumerian and Greek musical<br/>ideas with the Cope software (that&apos;s why I want the port).</p><p>--<br/>Ed Borasky<br/><a href="mailto:znmeb@aracnet.com">znmeb@aracnet.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.borasky-research.net/">http://www.borasky-research.net/</a></p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>5/21/2002 8:25:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Ed,</p><p>&gt;2.

David Cope thinks this is a great idea. :-) I&apos;m going to port the<br/>LISP stuff to an Open Source Linux LISP, probably CMUCL. The GUI stuff I<br/>will leave for later, and I&apos;m going to use &quot;sfront&quot; as the synthesis<br/>engine, so what I do will be portable to Windows assuming availability<br/>of a Common Lisp / CLOS package for Windows.</p><p>2. I just ordered the Cope / Hofstadter book, so I will have to wait<br/>until it arrives before porting any of that code. I do have a utility<br/>now to read Mac CDs on my Windows box so I can now extract the source<br/>from previous Cope CDs.</p><p>3. Speaking of &quot;sfront&quot;, the latest version is 0.80. They put some more<br/>of it under GPL, including, I think, the wonderful textbook on MPEG 4<br/>Structured Audio. The &quot;sfront&quot; manual has always been GPL, IIRC.</p><p>Since you did a portable GUI for &quot;scala&quot;, if you want to take on the GUI<br/>piece of this project, an area where I have very little expertise and<br/>even less desire to gain some, I&apos;d be glad to hand it off to you.<br/>Whatever we end up with will have to run on Macs, I think :).<br/>--<br/>M.

I&apos;m looking for tools to assist musical<br/> &gt;analysis.</p><p>Hofstadter played samples for the audience in several trials for<br/>Bach, Mozart, and Chopin.  The audience was to vote to identify<br/>the originals among several EMI compositions in each trial.  It<br/>was a bit of a laugh because it was completely obvious to everyone<br/>in the audience in all cases.  Many people felt the Bach came out<br/>the best.  I felt the Chopin.  In all cases the endings were a<br/>problem.  Then we were informed that the examples given were selected<br/>by Cope from hundreds of EMI runs.  Not very impressive.</p><p>I haven&apos;t heard the CD.  I&apos;m not interested in copying either, per<br/>se.  EMI also has modes that turn out &quot;original&quot; works.  Hofstadter<br/>played one, but I don&apos;t remember it.</p><p>Yes, something like EMI could be very useful in musical analysis.</p><p> &gt;Considering the kind of compute horsepower involved in, say, today&apos;s<br/> &gt;chess engines, I&apos;m not at all convinced that *I* will live to see a<br/> &gt;computer pass the Turing test.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how old you are, but I&apos;m 25 and have little doubt that<br/>I&apos;ll see it before I retire.</p><p>Chess is a hard problem when approached in the simplest way.  The<br/>narrowness of the current approach is alarming.  The fact that humans<br/>can still compete with the state of the art brute-force stuff tells me<br/>that the game is easier.  I expect an algorithm based on an analysis<br/>of the game to be produced before long and just beat everything, with<br/>minimal searching.
