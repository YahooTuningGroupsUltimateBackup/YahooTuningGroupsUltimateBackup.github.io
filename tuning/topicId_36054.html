Complete title: Complete<br/>Harpsichord Works, Music for Tack Piano &amp; Fortepiano, In Historic and<br/>Experimental Tunings.  Performed by Linda Burman-Hall, keyboards.<br/>&quot;Although for several centuries keyboards were made that presented<br/>more than twelve tones, the hypnosis of twelve has continued, and<br/>continues to spread wherever &apos;Western&apos; culture settles in. Even here<br/>there are apostates. The important composer Harry Partch built an<br/>entire orchestra for his works written in a forty-three tone scale.<br/>Younger people still do this and, in addition, tend to show tunings<br/>by means of &apos;lattices&apos;.  In this fine recording of my keyboard works,<br/>Linda and I have become a part of such apostasy from the dull grey of<br/>industrial twelve tone equal temperament and worked together to take<br/>back to ourselves as artists the natural right to tune pieces in ways<br/>that are fitting, appropriate, or enhance musical beauty.&quot; -- Lou<br/>Harrison</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div>
