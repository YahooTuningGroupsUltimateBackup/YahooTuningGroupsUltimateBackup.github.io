I wish they had simply reserved one of the<br/>128 programs for the &quot;drum kit voice&quot;; after all, program change on<br/>the MIDI percussion channel is meaningless as things stand, a real waste<br/>of flexible space.  But, I already have the ugly code to work around<br/>the problem.  And we&apos;re stuck with it till further notice.</p><p>Yes, that makes a lot of sense, it would work as well as a program change<br/>for &quot;drum kit voice&quot;, and could be sent on any channel without<br/>changing the channel - that would make things easier.<br/>I have a lot of lines of type:<br/> if(i!=NON_MELODIC_PERCUSSION_CHANNEL)<br/>...<br/>etc.</p><p>&gt; What I have in mind is to use a continuous foot controller exactly as<br/>&gt; the pitch wheel is now used: to add (or subtract) cents of offset to<br/>&gt; every pitch class of whatever tuning is chosen by the other means.  I<br/>&gt; visualize my left foot on organ pitch pedals, one or two octaves worth,<br/>&gt; and my right foot on the continuous controller.</p><p>Interpret a controller as a pitch bend - that would be easy to do in the<br/>code, a few lines to do the actual work, some thought needed for interface.</p><p>&gt; &gt;That&apos;s a nice idea. So composer could for example write a piece in,<br/>&gt; &gt;say, 7-tet, and you can adaptively tune it to make the 3/2s more mellow<br/>&gt; &gt;(and perhaps target 11/9s too?) if desired. Do I understand this right?</p><p>&gt; Yes.</p><p>That sounds incredibly useful to be able to do! (If you want to experiment,<br/>could be nice to hear how my 7-tet trio sounds re-tuned).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=27967 href="#27967">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2001 10:14:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Robert wrote:]<br/>&gt;I have a lot of lines of type:<br/>&gt;if(i!=NON_MELODIC_PERCUSSION_CHANNEL)</p><p>Yeah, I hear ya.
