Do you<br/>&gt; know if any music was written specifically for this instrument,<br/>&gt; other than Mozart&apos;s two lost pieces?</p><p>No, actually the only information I have about this specific<br/>instrument is that which you posted long ago to the list<br/>a while back (I think when it was hosted at Mills).</p><p>The first information I got about Petzval&apos;s musical activities<br/>was from Willi M&iuml;&iquest;&half;llendorf&apos;s book, which I translated as part<br/>of my Microfest 2001 presentation last April.</p><p>List-member Klaus Schmirler has generously improved on most of<br/>my translation, and when finished, the book will be available<br/>online at my website (with musicial illustrations linking to<br/>mp3&apos;s of the examples -- this is already available... follow the<br/>links at the bottom of the page, to previous chapters).</p><p>I quote from a footnote on a page of my translation in the<br/>last part of M&iuml;&iquest;&half;llendorf&apos;s book:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/moellendorf/conclusion.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/moellendorf/conclusion.htm</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;  Perhaps I would have had to call the now long-deceased<br/>&gt;&gt; professor Josef Petzval here as first, already in the 1860s<br/>&gt;&gt; with his lectures at Vienna University he availed himself of<br/>&gt;&gt; an instrument with more than 12 steps. But it seems to me as<br/>&gt;&gt; if the efforts of this original heading nevertheless were more<br/>&gt;&gt; towards improving our old system regarding its purity, than to<br/>&gt;&gt; enrich it with new tone steps. Because on his piano (by the<br/>&gt;&gt; way also on his &quot;Guitharp&quot;, a completely new instrument) one<br/>&gt;&gt; could make music either with 12 or with 31 steps, so that one<br/>&gt;&gt; could hardly speak of quarter-tone music here.</p><p>So Petzval obviously created a new 31-EDO instrument, but<br/>M&iuml;&iquest;&half;llendorf neglects to say whether Petzval&apos;s xenharmonic piano<br/>was one he invented or had made himself, or whether it was<br/>the already-existing instrument which Manuel documents.</p><p>An interesting aspect of Petzval&apos;s work is that he is today<br/>known primarily as an optician -- he designed an anastigmatic<br/>lens which eventually led to the invention of the movie camera.</p><p>This is a strong parallel here with Huygens, 2 centuries before,<br/>and I think it&apos;s very likely that Petzval&apos;s introduction to<br/>31-EDO music-theory was a fortuitous accident, thru his<br/>discovery of Huygens&apos;s writings on the subject while Petzval<br/>was studying Huygens&apos;s optical research.  (All of this is<br/>pure speculation on my part... but the pieces seem to fit<br/>the puzzle... hmmm... there&apos;s a subject for future research;<br/>mayble I&apos;ll be going to Vienna next summer...)</p><p>A mathematical exploration, &quot;The Petzval&apos;s Tone System&quot;, by<br/>list-member J&iuml;&iquest;&half;n Haluska, can be found in the book he edited,<br/>_Ambiguitiy and Music_, Seminar Mathematics and Music, Bratislava,<br/>2000, ISBN: 80-968374-0-0.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
