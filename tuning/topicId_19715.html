it will be easy to make the tree itself into an ascii numbering system.</p><p>Now, one needs to be able to continue the system into the entries,<br/>and there is an easy way to do that too.</p><p>As before, one needs to give details, but the system will be really simple<br/>in use.</p><p>Short expo:</p><p>$.$.$<br/>as the first line of text.</p><p>$.$.trines<br/>as the section header</p><p>See $$.trines$<br/>to refer to it</p><p>See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$$</p><p>to refer to another faq, where the title</p><p>$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$<br/>is the short one you see in the tree</p><p>To refer to a section within another faq:</p><p>See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$.trines$</p><p>to refer to a section in another faq.</p><p>In html<br/>$.$.$<br/>as the first line of text.</p><p>Use the html header 1, 2, 3<br/>type headings for the sections.</p><p>Use same method as before to refer to another faq.</p><p>Use<br/>$.unison vectors<br/>to make a bookmark in your faq that anyone else<br/>can link to.</p><p>Details:</p><p>.................In plain text files................</p><p>If you want your entry to be automatically numbered in the ASCII FAQ<br/>place<br/>$.$.$<br/>as the first line of text.</p><p>Then whenever you want a new section header, add a new line immediately<br/>before the title of the section, as<br/>$.$.$...name<br/>with the number of $.s giving the number of levels in the numbering system.</p><p>e.g.</p><p>$.main<br/>A gentle introduction to neo-Gothic progressions (1)<br/>.....<br/>$.$.trines<br/>Trines, quads, and intonational flavors<br/>....<br/>$.$.$.most proximal<br/>Part 1 of 2: Most proximal quads</p><p>Now if you want to refer to one of the sections, do it as</p><p>See $$.trines$</p><p>I.e.<br/>$$.bookmark name$</p><p>Be sure to include the . in $$.trines, as that makes it clear<br/>you are referring to another section in the same faq, rather<br/>than another faq.</p><p>Also be sure to double the initial $$ to show that it is a link.<br/>Notice the final $ as well.</p><p>To refer to an entry in another faq, do it as</p><p>See $$Joseph Pehrson$19-tET notations$$</p><p>i.e.</p><p>$$author$title$$</p><p>Notice the final $$</p><p>The up to date FAQ will have the author listed for each entry, at the head<br/>of the page, so that you can do this.<br/>(any objections to that?)</p><p>The title is the title as shown in the tree.</p><p>To refer to a section within another ascii faq, use</p><p>See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$.trines$</p><p>I.e.<br/>$$author$tree title$bookmark$</p><p>You can read the bookmark by looking it up in the draft tree.</p><p>If you do need to use a line beginning<br/>$.$.$...<br/>(perhaps in an ascii diagram)<br/>switch it off with</p><p>$$off</p><p>then back on again with<br/>$$on</p><p>This can be done at any point, and the lines<br/>$$on<br/>$$off<br/>will be removed completely from the final version, so there will be<br/>no extra blank lines.</p><p>Similarly<br/>$.trines<br/>will be removed, leaving extra lines, when the next line is<br/>made into a section heading as, say</p><p>In the html version of your document, your section headers will be made<br/>into the various header levels for html, and your references will<br/>be made into links to the section headers.</p><p>So in the final FAQ,</p><p>$.$.trines<br/>Trines, quads, and intonational flavors<br/>becomes<br/>.....1.1 Trines, quads, and intonational flavors</p><p>.....................in html..........................</p><p>If you want your entry to be automatically numbered in the ASCII FAQ<br/>place<br/>$.$.$<br/>as the first line of text.</p><p>This means, first line of visible text in the document.</p><p>Now, make sure you use the Header 1, Header 2, Header 3,... styles<br/>for section headings.</p><p>Now the program can treat any header 1 text as a section header<br/>for the top level in the numbering system for your file.</p><p>Header 2 text will be for the next level,<br/>and so on.</p><p>Since header 1 is rather large, you can start with header 2 if you<br/>prefer, or header 3 or smaller.</p><p>You can still use the ascii method too.</p><p>E.g. to refer to another entry in the faq, either use the url, or probably<br/>_better_, refer to it as</p><p>See $$MargoSchulter$Neo Gothic (gentle intro)$.trines</p><p>In your html you can also use bookmarks in the usual way.</p><p>In the ascii conversion, a link to a bookmarks will be<br/>converted to reference to the ascii header for whatever section it is in.</p><p>If you want one of your bookmarks to be referrable from<br/>any other faq, then make a new line of text immediately before it.</p><p>E.g.<br/>$.unison vectors</p><p>Then anyone else who wants to refer to that section can refer to it<br/>using</p><p>See $$your name$your faq$.unison vectors$</p><p>as before.</p><p>You can also use it yourself within your own faq, using See $$.unison vectors$$</p><p>As before, the $$. at the beginning indicates that it is a reference to<br/>a section in the same faq, rather than one in another faq.</p><p>The bookmarks will work in the &quot;on site&quot; faq whenever it is next<br/>refreshed.</p><p>To see them, in order to link to them, you look at the &quot;working draft&quot; faq.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19717 href="#19717">ðŸ”—</a>J Scott &#x3C;xjscott@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2001 9:36:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle

If all sorts of people can<br/>update the faq entries then different people<br/>might be changing the same file then they all go<br/>to put it back and only the last person in gets<br/>to see his changes. Also, what if the editor makes<br/>changes to a file, but then the original author<br/>uploads his old version to which he has been making<br/>changes? Using SCV control software I think is<br/>too much to ask the list to learn. A possible solution<br/>would be that changes and additions to faq entries<br/>should be routed through the original author or<br/>his designate (such as the editor). Oh I don&apos;t know.<br/>I don&apos;t see any easy answer.

Oh I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see any easy answer. What do you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>Hi Jeff...</p><p>This seems to make a lot of sense.  In other words, ONLY the original<br/>author of each FAQ entry would make changes on his own entry.  Other<br/>people shouldn&apos;t be allowed to do that...  They can comment,<br/>naturally, on the list concerning the entry, but they shouldn&apos;t make<br/>any changes.</p><p>Similarly, I believe John deLaubenfels should be the ONLY person to<br/>work with the DATABASE and organize the trees.   That seems like a<br/>reasonable role for a FAQ &quot;EDITOR.&quot;  So John won&apos;t really be very<br/>involved in editing the INDIVIDUAL FAQ entries... only the FINAL<br/>ORGANIZATION.  This will cut down a LOT on the work John has to do!</p><p>I agree very much with Robert Walker that we should let the, er,<br/>&quot;peculiarities&quot; of each FAQ submitter shine through.  If it&apos;s<br/>understandable, there is no reason to make the whole thing in<br/>&quot;Standard English.&quot;  That&apos;s a bit like making all music fit 12-tET!!!<br/>:)</p><p>So, John&apos;s work will be cut down substantially... He only organizes<br/>the DATABASE tree, and won&apos;t even have to EDIT the copy that resides<br/>in the FILES section.</p><p>So, not everything will be perfect.  Big deal.  The idea is to get<br/>something out there for commentary...</p><p>I understand from Robert&apos;s post, that he has figured out how to do<br/>the ASCII tree organizing!  It uses the &quot;$&quot; sign, or several of them<br/>for levels.  I don&apos;t fully understand it yet, nor do I need to... but<br/>as long as the convention is established, and we know how to do it,<br/>that&apos;s all that&apos;s needed.</p><p>Oh... incidentally, John deLaubenfels has a considerable amount of<br/>computer expertise, so I am certain that he will EASILY understand<br/>the systems proposed by Robert Walker once Robert slows down a bit<br/>and<br/>clarifies them.</p><p>Right now the &quot;excitement&quot; is setting it all up and looking at ALL<br/>the options, which is what we&apos;re seeing in some of Robert&apos;s posts at<br/>the moment.</p><p>It&apos;s gonna&apos; be great!</p><p>_______ ____ _____ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
