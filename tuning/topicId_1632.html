I am trying to determine the<br/>actual scales, as opposed to scales &apos;suggested&apos; by theoreticians, by making<br/>measurements on actual improvisations from indisputable masters in various<br/>&apos;modes&apos;. The &apos;scales&apos; I am uncovering are far from being equally tempered.<br/>Furthermore, they are nor even deterministic. Instead, they are in the form<br/>of &apos;distributions&apos; where a certain &apos;note&apos; is represented by a cluster of<br/>sounds displaying a certain statistical distribution.  The number of such<br/>clusters varies with the modal scale being used. My research is still in<br/>its infancy and already it is very exciting to deal with non-deterministic<br/>scales.

Modulation is not found in most other cultures.<br/>&lt;</p><p>The origins of Thai tunings are obscure; while the utility for<br/>transposition is clear, the association of particular pentatonic &quot;keys&quot;<br/>with particular repertoire. Indeed, this suggests that 7tet was<br/>approximated as a means for the idiophones in the ensemble in order to play<br/>with a variety of other instruments, not as a device in itself.</p><p>Daniel Franke informs me that at one point in Chinese court music history,<br/>well before adoption of 12tet in the west, a good approximation of equal<br/>temperament was ordered so that the calendric modulations through the<br/>ritual stone chime repertoire would be represented by exact transpositions.<br/>The conjectured Babylonian harp tuning document suggests that modulation by<br/>fifths was a device of extreme antiquity across Asia.</p><p>Modulation -- albeit of the well tempered, not equal tempered sort -- is<br/>found in many musics. In East Bali, players in the ritual 7-tone ensembles<br/>modulate with great virtuosity to each of seven five-tone modes. In Central<br/>Java, modulation between pathet is common, both within a single piece and<br/>in transpositions of whole pieces from one pathet to another.  In Japan,<br/>some items in the Gagaku repertoire exist in several modal transpositions.<br/>Modulation via transposition is central to African xylophone playing. And<br/>in South India, the Raga Malaka (&quot;Garland of Ragas&quot;)transverses a series of<br/>modes within a single improvisation; these modes are typically related as<br/>if they followed a logical sequence of key signature changes, in effect,<br/>modulation by fifths.</p></div><h3><a id=1819 href="#1819">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/1999 12:09:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Their tuning is close to 7ET but not any more that Slendro is 5ET.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady&lt;</p><p>KG:</p><p>I hate to be the bringer of bad news again, BUT, with the advent of digital<br/>tuners, _some_ (by no means not all) Thai (and exile Laotian) musicians<br/>have adopted a fairly exact 7tet.
