Most of you have probably<br/>forgotten or tired of those discussions, but I will have a nagging sense of<br/>negligence if I do not at least offer to follow up, since I wrote the article and it<br/>caused such intense reactions.

I&apos;ve looked over your messages 38555 and 38622. It seems strange, since<br/>so much time has gone by, to get all mixed up in these issues again. But it does feel<br/>like unfinshed business, especially since your reactions were so heated. So, here we<br/>go.</p></div>
