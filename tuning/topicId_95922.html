The pentatonic/hexatonic/heptatonic/etc. part is sort of the &quot;kingdom&quot; (animalia, plantae, etc.), the monomacro/dimacro/etc. part is the &quot;phylum&quot;.  You can always break it down further, into proper/improper, and then into particular degrees of propriety/impropriety.  However, I don&apos;t feel that just specifying whether a scale is proper or improper is helpful enough to be worth the extra word.  Assuming reasonable bounds of properiety/impropriety, a melody written in a proper scale of a given configuration will work the same when played in an improper version.  Compare the 26-EDO and 27-EDO 5L+2s scales, for instance.  If I was going to include anything about propriety in the name, it would probably specify the exact ratio of L:s, maybe along the lines of &quot;three-to-two pentamacro heptatonic&quot;, but that would uniquely identify the scale and would not serve as a category.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2011 5:12:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jan 29, 2011 at 4:34 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It recently occurred to me that DE scales can be indexed by a combination of their number of large steps (or small, but I picked large) and their number of total notes.

You also have to consider that propriety means different things depending on the period.  For example, in 5L+5s in 30-EDO, you can have L:s be 5:1, but the scale is still technically proper--you&apos;ll never have intervals of one class be higher than intervals in the class above or lower than intervals in the class below.  I do use the terms &quot;proper&quot; and &quot;improper&quot; to distinguish scales which are instantiated twice in a single EDO, though--such as 25-EDO and its two versions of 5L+5s.  And by the way, I&apos;ve had a bad habit of calling all 5L+5s scales &quot;Blackwood&quot;, which I&apos;m going to stop doing, because Blackwood as a composer did not use that scale in other 5n-EDOs, and the temperament named after him refers specifically to a 5-limit temperament close to 15-EDO.</p><p>At any rate, trying to link DE scales smaller than 11 or 12 notes to temperaments is insane.  What about pentatonics, Mike?  Are you going to call all 2L+3s pentatonics &quot;Meantone&quot;, despite the fact that this MOS range encompasses about a million different temperaments, including Mavila and Superpyth and Flattone etc. etc.?</p><p>I don&apos;t want to be a jerk about this, but I think you&apos;re barking mad for pursuing this.  Affixing a temperament name to a scale that fails to achieve the harmonic goals of the temperament it is named for does an injustice both to the scale and the temperament.

Or, if you think it makes more<br/>sense, split it up from the 7-equal fifth to the 12-equal fifth for<br/>the proper version, and then separately deal with the 12-equal to the<br/>5-equal generator for the improper version, and deal with the two<br/>separately.</p><p>As you try each generator, figure out which mapping gives you the<br/>least error. You will then end up with data about which mappings have<br/>the least error over different generator ranges, and you can use this<br/>error for some kind of generator-specific badness computation.</p><p>Once you have that data, it seems like there should be some kind of<br/>sensible way to pick out the best one and say that that&apos;s the most<br/>generally applicable temperament for that MOS.</p><p>&gt; So maybe it makes more sense to start lower on the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; tree, come up with different temperaments for things like 16&amp;13, and<br/>&gt; &gt; then go one entry higher and at each level higher, give the name to<br/>&gt; &gt; that MOS the name of the lower-badness temperament of the two entries<br/>&gt; &gt; below. At least I think that makes sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What a headache.</p><p>Haha, well, it makes sense to me :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t see how the zeta function could help.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought you guys were talking about how it could remove the need to<br/>&gt; &gt; specify prime limit when doing stuff like this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t need to specify a prime limit, or a val, for edos.</p><p>In Graham&apos;s temperament finder you do, so I thought that was a part of this...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2011 12:32:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jan 30, 2011 at 2:29 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, so that&apos;s a good point.

Maybe it does make more sense if you<br/>&gt; &gt; distinguish between the proper and improper versions, which seems to<br/>&gt; &gt; yield more sensible results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More sensible, sure, but not fully sensible yet. In the example I gave of Porcupine, that 23, 31, 38, and 39 are 1L+6s-compatible but NOT Porcupine temperaments, they are all *still proper*. You also have to consider that propriety means different things depending on the period. For example, in 5L+5s in 30-EDO, you can have L:s be 5:1, but the scale is still technically proper--you&apos;ll never have intervals of one class be higher than intervals in the class above or lower than intervals in the class below. I do use the terms &quot;proper&quot; and &quot;improper&quot; to distinguish scales which are instantiated twice in a single EDO, though--such as 25-EDO and its two versions of 5L+5s.</p><p>OK, but if the point of this is to figure out which temperament is<br/>generally most applicable to a certain MOS, which is also a way I&apos;m<br/>proposing to name them. I can&apos;t figure out if you think that it&apos;ll be<br/>a confusing naming system or if you think there&apos;s no utility in<br/>figuring out which temperaments fit which MOS&apos;s. Either way, I don&apos;t<br/>see why it&apos;s unreasonable or a disservice to this scale to still call<br/>the 1L6s MOS &quot;Porcupine,&quot; even if there are other valid temperaments<br/>on the fringe that fit it. Again, if you don&apos;t like it, you could<br/>still just come up with a list of temperaments rather than just<br/>picking one.</p><p>&gt; And by the way, I&apos;ve had a bad habit of calling all 5L+5s scales &quot;Blackwood&quot;, which I&apos;m going to stop doing, because Blackwood as a composer did not use that scale in other 5n-EDOs, and the temperament named after him refers specifically to a 5-limit temperament close to 15-EDO.</p><p>OK, but I wouldn&apos;t mind giving the 5L5s MOS the name &quot;Blackwood&quot; in<br/>his honor anyway, and since the lowest badness temperament that<br/>supports 5L5s is probably Blackwood.</p><p>&gt; At any rate, trying to link DE scales smaller than 11 or 12 notes to temperaments is insane. What about pentatonics, Mike? Are you going to call all 2L+3s pentatonics &quot;Meantone&quot;, despite the fact that this MOS range encompasses about a million different temperaments, including Mavila and Superpyth and Flattone etc. etc.?</p><p>We&apos;re talking about differentiating between proper and improper<br/>scales, and for the improper 2L3s pentatonic, you&apos;d get mavila, and<br/>for the proper one, you&apos;d get meantone. Or, if you&apos;d like, and as I&apos;ve<br/>said before, you could come up with a list of temperaments that apply<br/>over the range of the MOS that you want. You&apos;ve said there&apos;s no<br/>usefulness in doing that, but then you keep bringing this point up,<br/>which is exactly where the usefulness lies.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t want to be a jerk about this, but I think you&apos;re barking mad for pursuing this. Affixing a temperament name to a scale that fails to achieve the harmonic goals of the temperament it is named for does an injustice both to the scale and the temperament.

Mike.  I&apos;ve been going round in circles with Paul and Carl off-list over what is essentially the same subject matter here, and the reason I&apos;m getting so frustrated is because you&apos;re sort of one step behind the discussions I&apos;ve been having.  I&apos;ve been brought overwhelmingly to one conclusion: the basis for grouping scales according to temperament is fundamentally different from the basis for grouping scales according to DE/MOS patterns, and it makes no sense to try to shoehorn the two together.</p><p>The point of temperament is to achieve specific harmonic goals--defined in terms of JI--with a lower dimensionality than pure JI, for the sake of improving harmonic efficiency and decreasing complexity while maintaing *as much accuracy as possible*.  You know this.  I know this.  But it is rarely spelled out.  Fundamental to the nature of temperament is the set of harmonic goals; when you get to the point where a tuning no longer achieves those goals with a reasonable level of accuracy, *that* is where the boundary of the temperament lies.</p><p>The point of the distributionally-even/moment-of-symmetry paradigm is to group together differently-tuned scales which share a common pattern of 2nds.  All DE scales are bounded by equal scales, and can approach either of these equal scales with arbitrary closeness if we allow arbitrarily-large EDOs.  There are thus constraints on how a generator can be tuned and still produce a scale that remains in one scale family, and these constraints are occasionally responsible for the scales in some DE scale families to have a lot in common harmonically, more or less.  The 5L+2s scale is a good example of this, since there&apos;s barely 40 cents between the lower and upper bounds on the generator, even without distinguishing proper and improper.  Other DE scales are not like this.  The EDOs that bound a DE family can be handily defined as the EDO corresponding to the number of Large steps and the EDO corresponding to the number of total steps.  The fewer the Large steps and/or total steps, the greater the range in generator tunings.  2L+5s goes between 2-EDO and 7-EDO, or between 600 and 686 cents, just about double the range of 5L+2s.  1L+6s goes between 1-EDO and 7-EDO, with a range of 0 to 171 cents!  The 1L+4s pentatonic goes from 0 to 240 cents!  For scales like this, even dividing into proper and improper does little to restrain the massive harmonic variability.</p><p>It&apos;s one thing (and perfectly fine to do, quite useful even) to index the optimal generators for however many temperaments you like according to the DE scales they produce.  If that&apos;s all you&apos;re trying to do, that&apos;s great.  I gave you my blessing in that endeavor last time.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you are insisting on finding the &quot;best&quot; temperament in each range of DE scale generators and then naming the whole DE scale family after that temperament, my objections are three-fold.  The first is that you are doing a disservice to the temperament paradigm by lumping a bunch of different temperaments together under one name, just because they share the same DE scale.  There are a bazillion temperaments with a generator between 4\7 and 7\12, does it really make sense to call them all &quot;Meantone&quot; just because Meantone has the lowest badness?  Does anyone on this list ONLY use tunings which are the absolute best at what they do?  I don&apos;t think so.</p><p>The second objection is that what you are doing doesn&apos;t make any practical sense.  If what you are interested in using musically is the temperament paradigm--i.e. if you have a specific set of harmonic goals that you want to achieve--then you have no reason to use the DE paradigm.  You can say everything you need to say about the scales you want to use in the language of the temperament paradigm.  If, on the other hand, you are more concerned with melodic structures, and less concerned with what harmonies are specifically being achieved, then you can say all you need to say about the scales you use with the DE paradigm.  If you are interested in both, you can (as you have expressed a desire to do) cross-reference according to generator tunings.  That, as I said above, would be neat to be able to do.</p><p>The third objection is if you&apos;re going to give a collective name to a group of things, it would be sensible to name them according to a property they *all* have in common.  I mean, say you have two barrels.  In one barrel, you have a huge amount of apples, a few oranges, a few bananas, a few kiwis, and a few melons.  In another barrel, you have a huge amount of beets, a few carrots, a few heads of lettuce, a few bunches of kale.  Now, you could call the first barrel &quot;the apple barrel&quot; and the second barrel &quot;the beet barrel&quot;, but wouldn&apos;t it make more sense and be more accurate to call the first barrel &quot;the fruit barrel&quot; and the second barrel &quot;the vegetable barrel&quot;?  DE scale families all have a pattern of 2nds in common; they do not all have temperaments in common.  It&apos;s less reasonable to name them after temperaments, even if most of the generators in the range have a temperament in common, than it is to name them after their pattern of seconds.</p><p>I just don&apos;t understand how you can fail to see that naming DE scale families after the &quot;best&quot; temperaments found in their tuning range will do nothing but blur important distinctions between temperaments.  This is undeniable, incontrovertible, pure absolute fact!  I&apos;ve been warned by Paul over and over again not to conflate two temperaments just because they have the same DE scale.   I used to insist that it made no sense NOT to call 13-EDO an Orwell temperament, because it has the same 9-note DE scale found in 31-EDO and 22-EDO and generally-speaking you can translate music written in that scale from 31-EDO to 13-EDO and you won&apos;t lose much.  But I was wrong, because (again) temperaments are bounded by error and 13-EDO is out of bounds for the consonances Orwell is based on.  Paul&apos;s suggestion was that if you want to name a range of tunings after a temperament,  you should define the boundaries of the range according to a damage threshold, which I think is a better idea.  You might try that approach.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2011 3:40:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I used to insist that it made no sense NOT to call 13-EDO an Orwell temperament, because it has the same 9-note DE scale found in 31-EDO and 22-EDO and generally-speaking you can translate music written in that scale from 31-EDO to 13-EDO and you won&apos;t lose much.</p><p>You&apos;re a scary guy, Igs.

Obviously if you&apos;re using Orwell in its full 7-limit glory, 13-EDO is not gonna work.  I&apos;m not THAT crazy.

Thanks for going into so<br/>much detail, because there&apos;s a lot of connections there I hadn&apos;t made.<br/>I still have a few comments:</p><p>Your objections to not name the entire MOS family after whichever one<br/>comes out on top were well-thought through and very valid as far as<br/>coming up with a sensible naming system is involved. However, I&apos;m more<br/>interested in trying to find connections between concepts, so that I<br/>can develop musically useful metrics that don&apos;t already exist, and to<br/>come to a broader understanding of what&apos;s going on. Whether it makes<br/>sense to call MOS&apos;s by the name of their best associated is more a<br/>matter of logistics and communication rather than of conceptual<br/>integrity. I would be personally willing to let that small evil slide,<br/>because I think the results would be useful in classifying MOS&apos;s, but<br/>you have good arguments about why such a system might not be ideal.<br/>That&apos;s fine and the issue of naming is, I guess, not anything that I<br/>have really strong opinions about.</p><p>Perhaps most simply I am just trying to advance a conceptual point,<br/>which is that people usually view it such that while the DE scales and<br/>the regular temperaments are two completely different things, stemming<br/>from two completely different paradigms, and that can maybe be loosely<br/>associated, that the associations can be made much tighter if certain<br/>additional mathematical characteristics are taken into consideration.</p><p>The first is that when you talk about an MOS to begin with, you&apos;re<br/>still doing some kind of quasi-regular mapping, because you&apos;re<br/>specifying what the octave is. If this weren&apos;t the case, then there&apos;d<br/>be no difference between 5L5s and 4L4s, because you could look at the<br/>5L5s one as just a 4L4s in which the octave is mapped to 960 cents,<br/>which you could always do if you wanted to anyway. So if a rank 2<br/>temperament has two generators, then what an MOS scale is is just a<br/>rank-2 temperament in which only a map for 2/1 is defined in terms of<br/>periods and the other is left open.</p><p>The second thing is all aspects of this other generator aren&apos;t left<br/>completely open, because by specifying a pattern of large and small<br/>steps, you&apos;re effectively placing bounds on the size of the generator.<br/>More specifically, what you&apos;re doing is specifying a ratio between So<br/>if you&apos;re saying that we have a 5L2s scale, for example, what you&apos;re<br/>really saying is that 2 is mapped to 1 period, and the generator<br/>ranges from 3\5 to 5\7 of the size of that period, in cents. If we end<br/>trying to apply the MOS map for 5L2s to a generating interval outside<br/>of this range, we end up with something that&apos;s not 5L2s, and hence an<br/>important interval somewhere is getting reversed.</p><p>For example, if you&apos;re in meantone, and you apply the meantone map to<br/>a generator greater than 720 cents, then 16/15 ends up getting<br/>reversed and you don&apos;t get a 5L2s scale anymore. Or if you&apos;re less<br/>than 686 cents, 25/24 ends up getting reversed, and you don&apos;t end up<br/>getting a 5L2s scale anymore. If you for some reason were weird enough<br/>to apply the porcupine map to this generator, then as the generator<br/>goes beyond 720 cents, it&apos;s (10/9)^-6 * (2/1)^3 = 531441/250000 that<br/>gets reversed, which since 250/243 is a unison vector means that 9/2<br/>gets reversed. Huge intervals get reversed when you apply weird<br/>mappings to generators and vice versa.</p><p>Furthermore, this works both ways: as you specify a mapping and a set<br/>of intervals that must either be reversed or not reversed, you start<br/>placing MOS-style bounds on the width of the generator. As you end up<br/>specifying an infinite series of intervals that must be reversed, you<br/>successively limit the range of the generator until you approach a<br/>single one. This is analogous to going down the scale tree in<br/>different directions until you reach &quot;the bottom,&quot; where you reach a<br/>single generator, and depending on which way you go at each turn, you<br/>get different generators, both defined in cents.</p><p>So the two aren&apos;t entirely different approaches; rather, they&apos;re<br/>almost the same thing. If you give regular mappings bounds by<br/>specifying reversed intervals, you end up with a structure homomorphic<br/>to the MOS&apos;s. Specifically, the more reversed intervals you specify,<br/>the tighter your bounds get, and the further down the scale tree you<br/>go.</p><p>That is what I am pointing out, no more, no less. I think that that&apos;s<br/>a useful realization and that it might lead to a lot of interesting<br/>things later, one of those things being a sensible way to name MOS&apos;s.<br/>So your objections, in light of all this, are as follows:</p><p>1) This structure is homomorphic, but not isomorphic. While such a<br/>series for a certain mapping does uniquely correspond to an MOS, the<br/>same does not apply in reverse. A certain MOS does not imply a unique,<br/>single regular mapping with a set of reversed intervals, but rather<br/>could correspond to any mapping at all, even stupid ones. And I say<br/>yes, but if you sort the resultant mappings by the error in the range<br/>of the MOS and some normalized measure of complexity, you end up with<br/>a list of how well each temperament corresponds to each MOS.</p><p>2) While you can come up with a list, to just pick the largest entry<br/>from each list and say that&apos;s &quot;the temperament&quot; for a certain MOS<br/>ignores the fact that different temperaments predominate in different<br/>ranges within a single MOS. This is also true, and as you go further<br/>down the scale tree, this becomes less of a problem, and as you<br/>specify more intervals being reversed, it becomes more clear which<br/>temperament provides the most sensible map for those intervals.</p><p>3) You finally assert that psychoacoustic tuning error is more<br/>important for drawing error bounds for temperaments rather than which<br/>intervals get reversed. I think that the two are both important and<br/>work together. The harmonic structure of what&apos;s going on is important,<br/>and you want to make sure that you don&apos;t end up with a temperament<br/>whose error is too high. The melodic structure is also extremely<br/>important for what&apos;s going on, and although blackwood and porcupine<br/>have the same 5-limit error in 15-tet, they sound completely different<br/>from one another. They are both important things to keep track of, but<br/>the deal here is that the series of reversed intervals and its subsets<br/>correspond to different generator ranges, which also happen to<br/>correlate perfectly with different MOS&apos;s, which are basically ways of<br/>storing melodic patterns, which are very important when it comes to<br/>making music.</p><p>Hope that&apos;s thorough enough.

The DE paradigm works just as well if you&apos;re looking at scales that fill the 3/1, or the 3/2, or the sqrt 2.  To use the naming convention I suggested, no such assumption is required; all you have to assume is that all the scales you&apos;re discussing span the same interval.  The whole &quot;xL+ys&quot; thing is actually an equation, and when we&apos;re talking about EDO DE scales, we&apos;re tacitly saying &quot;xL+ys=1200 cents&quot;, or maybe in other terms &quot;xL+ys=n-EDO&quot; if we&apos;re specifying sizes of L and s in # of scale steps instead of cents.  In fact, it&apos;s quite possible to use the DE paradigm without using the terms &quot;generator&quot; and &quot;period&quot; at all, and may in fact be simpler to do it that way.  That&apos;s one reason I&apos;m actually starting to prefer the term &quot;DE&quot; to &quot;MOS&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The second thing is all aspects of this other generator aren&apos;t left<br/>&gt; completely open, because by specifying a pattern of large and small<br/>&gt; steps, you&apos;re effectively placing bounds on the size of the generator.</p><p>Yes, I mentioned this specifically.  Did you miss that part?  Can&apos;t blame you, it was a bit of a long-winded reply.  To repeat what I said: while this is true, the tightness of the bounds depends not just on the size of the scale but also on how many large steps are in the scale.  The EDO bounds of an MOS scale are defined as the EDOs equal to the number of Large steps and equal to the number of total steps.  So 5L+2s is between 5-EDO and 7-EDO, but 1L+6s is between 1-EDO and 7-EDO.  I think the problem is that you&apos;ve only been looking at 5L+2s, which has a comparatively narrow range of generators.</p><p>Since the size of the scale is also a variable that determines the bounds of the generators, it will also be true that pentatonics are a bit more difficult to categorize.  As I said previously (and you may have missed), for a pentatonic of 1L+4s, you&apos;re looking at a generator range between 1\1 and 1\5, or about 240 cents!  So the point is, the number of temperaments that will fall within a DE family will vary greatly depending on the size of the scale and the number of large steps it has.  So on the one hand, you&apos;ll have an easy time drawing a correspondence between 9L+1s and (I think) Negri temperament, and a very difficult time drawing a correspondence between 1L+4s and any one temperament.</p><p>*I suggest you look at all the 1L DE scales before proceeding.*</p><p>&gt; So the two aren&apos;t entirely different approaches; rather, they&apos;re<br/>&gt; almost the same thing. If you give regular mappings bounds by<br/>&gt; specifying reversed intervals, you end up with a structure homomorphic<br/>&gt; to the MOS&apos;s. Specifically, the more reversed intervals you specify,<br/>&gt; the tighter your bounds get, and the further down the scale tree you<br/>&gt; go.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I understand what you mean when you say an interval gets &quot;reversed&quot;.</p><p>&gt; 2) While you can come up with a list, to just pick the largest entry<br/>&gt; from each list and say that&apos;s &quot;the temperament&quot; for a certain MOS<br/>&gt; ignores the fact that different temperaments predominate in different<br/>&gt; ranges within a single MOS. This is also true, and as you go further<br/>&gt; down the scale tree, this becomes less of a problem, and as you<br/>&gt; specify more intervals being reversed, it becomes more clear which<br/>&gt; temperament provides the most sensible map for those intervals.</p><p>Yes, the further toward the canopy of the scale-tree you go, the closer to specific regular temperaments you get, but the higher in EDOs you get, too.  At the level at which it becomes possible to make a meaningful connection between a DE family and a temperament, it is no longer possible to generalize that connection back toward the root of the scale tree.</p><p>&gt; 3) You finally assert that psychoacoustic tuning error is more<br/>&gt; important for drawing error bounds for temperaments rather than which<br/>&gt; intervals get reversed. I think that the two are both important and<br/>&gt; work together.</p><p>If both are important, then both must be taken into account.  I think what you should do, if you want to do this properly, is figure out the range of generators for each temperament that keeps the approximated harmonies below a certain damage threshold, presumably defined as &quot;the point in which the approximations are no longer psychoacoustically identifiable as the intervals they are meant to approximate&quot;.  Then correlate those ranges with ranges of DE families.  At that point, I will gladly accept a naming convention that names DE families after temperaments, but I kind of doubt anyone is really up to the task of calculating error boundaries *for all the good 13-limit (and lower) temperaments, as well as subgroup temperaments*.</p><p>Really, there&apos;s no point in any more argument.  I think if you actually pursue this, the ways in which it is problematic will become apparent pretty quick.  First, you&apos;ve got to set a badness threshold to constrain the infinity of temperaments, then you&apos;ve got to decide what prime limit (and what subgroups) you are willing to consider tempering, then you&apos;ve got to calculate the bounds based on psychoacoustic damage, then you&apos;ve got to index by generator range and compare the badness of all the temperaments (and subgroups) that have overlapping generator ranges and single out those that have the lowest badness (which may be misleading depending on the variety of subgroup temperaments you look at).  The results from this will undoubtedly be useful, but DANG that sounds like a lot of work!  And I do not expect the results to cover anything below heptatonic scales, and most probably not lower than decatonic in many areas of the generator spectrum.  So it still won&apos;t be a viable alternative to the DE scale-family naming scheme I proposed.  But I don&apos;t really think this is about names, anyway.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2011 11:51:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think the problem is that you&apos;ve only been looking at 5L+2s, which has a comparatively narrow range of generators.</p><p>One way to look at that problem is this: I&apos;ve shown how, given a period expressed as 1/N of an octave, and a generator expressed as p/q of an octave, and a prime limit, you can compute a rank two temperament in that prime limit with that period and generator.

What&apos;s the difference between 8L2s and 4L1s? 8L2s is<br/>just 4L1s, but you&apos;re mapping the period differently.

While your example of the<br/>7-limit porcupine-ish scale above was good (what is the name of that<br/>temperament?), 1\1 and 1\5 has a definite sweet spot. Or 1L9s scales<br/>that have a generator of 20 cents, etc.</p><p>Tangentially, I would personally support a hybrid naming system that<br/>gives credit to a temperament whenever it really does dominates a<br/>certain MOS, and comes up with a &quot;neutral&quot; name or a portmanteau of<br/>the winners when no clear winner dominates.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So the two aren&apos;t entirely different approaches; rather, they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; almost the same thing. If you give regular mappings bounds by<br/>&gt; &gt; specifying reversed intervals, you end up with a structure homomorphic<br/>&gt; &gt; to the MOS&apos;s. Specifically, the more reversed intervals you specify,<br/>&gt; &gt; the tighter your bounds get, and the further down the scale tree you<br/>&gt; &gt; go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure I understand what you mean when you say an interval gets &quot;reversed&quot;.</p><p>LOL geez man, that&apos;s the whole point of my rant here! :)</p><p>An interval is reversed when it gets mapped to a negative size in<br/>cents. So in 19-equal, for example, the Pythagorean comma is reversed,<br/>because if you go up 12 fifths and down whatever many octaves, you end<br/>up at a lower pitch than you started at. This is because meantones<br/>equate the diesis and the Pythagorean comma, and unless they&apos;re both<br/>getting tempered out as in 12-tet, one of them is going to be reversed<br/>with respect to the other.</p><p>So let&apos;s go to 12L7s scales vs 7L12s scales, and let&apos;s say you apply<br/>the meantone mapping here. The difference between a 12L7s scale vs a<br/>7L12s scale, expressed in regular temperament parlance, is the<br/>difference between whether a diesis is smaller than a chromatic<br/>semitone or larger than a chromatic semitone. If the diesis is<br/>smaller, you get a 12L7s scale, and if it&apos;s larger, you get a 7L12s<br/>scale. If the diesis ends up being larger than a chromatic semitone,<br/>then the Natural Order Of Things has been broken: the difference<br/>between them, which is the magic comma, is now negative. And the<br/>boundary between 12L7s and 7L12s scales is 19-equal, which is a magic<br/>temperament.</p><p>The same applies if you look at 5L2s scales vs 2L5s scales, but you<br/>decide to keep the meantone mapping the whole time: when you flip over<br/>to a &quot;meantone&quot; generator that generates a 2L5s scale, that&apos;s the same<br/>thing as saying that 25/24 has been reversed. In this case, it makes<br/>more sense to apply the mavila mapping, but this is just for the sake<br/>of theory - likewise, if you apply the mavila mapping and you pick a<br/>generator that makes a 5L2s scale, 25/24 also gets reversed.</p><p>If you look at 7L5s scales vs 5L7s scales, and if you apply the<br/>meantone mapping here, the difference between 7L5s vs 5L7s translates<br/>over to regular temperament parlance as the difference between whether<br/>or not 128/125 gets reversed. You could be absurd and apply the<br/>porcupine mapping here, and say that the ~700 cent sized generator is<br/>a 10/9, and if you do that, the interval getting reversed maps to 9/2<br/>instead of 128/125, which is silly.</p><p>Your point, then, is that sometimes more than one mapping applies, and<br/>the boundaries between when superpyth makes sense to use vs meantone<br/>have more to do with the temperament&apos;s error from 10:12:15 vs 6:7:9<br/>and all that, and less to do with reversed intervals. And I&apos;m saying,<br/>yes, you&apos;re right, but the latter is equally as important, because it<br/>dictates the melodic structure of what&apos;s going on. The point is simply<br/>that when you specify a DE scale, you&apos;re specifying which intervals<br/>get reversed without specifying what they map to, but the two aren&apos;t<br/>really separate.</p><p>I brought all of this up and Graham then pointed out that this is<br/>isomorphic to when people refer to meantone as &quot;the 12&amp;19<br/>temperament.&quot; Why isn&apos;t porcupine the 12&amp;19 temperament? At least,<br/>that&apos;s what I was understanding his meaning to be. etc.</p><p>&gt; Yes, the further toward the canopy of the scale-tree you go, the closer to specific regular temperaments you get, but the higher in EDOs you get, too. At the level at which it becomes possible to make a meaningful connection between a DE family and a temperament, it is no longer possible to generalize that connection back toward the root of the scale tree.</p><p>That&apos;s fine, but a decent list of all of the top 4 that lie below each<br/>node would be enough for me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 3) You finally assert that psychoacoustic tuning error is more<br/>&gt; &gt; important for drawing error bounds for temperaments rather than which<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals get reversed. I think that the two are both important and<br/>&gt; &gt; work together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If both are important, then both must be taken into account. I think what you should do, if you want to do this properly, is figure out the range of generators for each temperament that keeps the approximated harmonies below a certain damage threshold, presumably defined as &quot;the point in which the approximations are no longer psychoacoustically identifiable as the intervals they are meant to approximate&quot;. Then correlate those ranges with ranges of DE families. At that point, I will gladly accept a naming convention that names DE families after temperaments, but I kind of doubt anyone is really up to the task of calculating error boundaries *for all the good 13-limit (and lower) temperaments, as well as subgroup temperaments*.</p><p>I think there will be a few cases in which this approach works really<br/>well. The reason I suggested using the zeta function for this is that<br/>it has been claimed on tuning-math that you could assume from the<br/>Riemann hypothesis a measure of tuning-error which removes the need to<br/>specify prime limit at all. I&apos;m not sure if this handles subgroups or<br/>not. Gene then posted on here that equal temperaments don&apos;t need limit<br/>to be specified, and my brain exploded, so I&apos;m not sure where we stand<br/>on that.</p><p>&gt; Really, there&apos;s no point in any more argument. I think if you actually pursue this, the ways in which it is problematic will become apparent pretty quick. First, you&apos;ve got to set a badness threshold to constrain the infinity of temperaments</p><p>This is something that logflat badness does really well, no? I&apos;m still<br/>learning about it.</p><p>&gt; then you&apos;ve got to decide what prime limit (and what subgroups) you are willing to consider tempering</p><p>Unless we can work out the zeta error thing.</p><p>&gt; then you&apos;ve got to calculate the bounds based on psychoacoustic damage</p><p>This is redundant, because if we&apos;re actually comparing temperaments in<br/>some generator range, then the ones with so much error that they&apos;re<br/>unrecognizable don&apos;t need to be pruned off beforehand, because they&apos;ll<br/>naturally end up at the bottom of the list.</p><p>&gt; then you&apos;ve got to index by generator range and compare the badness of all the temperaments (and subgroups) that have overlapping generator ranges and single out those that have the lowest badness (which may be misleading depending on the variety of subgroup temperaments you look at).</p><p>Yeah, this part&apos;s going to suck. I think there&apos;s probably some simple<br/>way to do it if you work a lot of the math out.</p><p>&gt; And I do not expect the results to cover anything below heptatonic scales, and most probably not lower than decatonic in many areas of the generator spectrum. So it still won&apos;t be a viable alternative to the DE scale-family naming scheme I proposed. But I don&apos;t really think this is about names, anyway.</p><p>I like the DE scale-family naming scheme you proposed, but it&apos;s just<br/>the same thing as saying xLns in Latin :)</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2011 7:22:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s more like you&apos;re *assuming* what the octave is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An MOS, or a DE scale, specifies a pattern of large and whole steps.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the same thing, mathematically, as specifying a ratio that the<br/>&gt; generator and period are in some proportional ratio to one another (or<br/>&gt; in some range of ratios). But to do this, you have to say how many<br/>&gt; periods maps to 2, or else there is no difference between 4L4s and<br/>&gt; 5L5s.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Right, you do have to specify a period (and thus, I suppose, a mapping) before hand and assume that all the scales you are talking about share it, or else 5L5s and 1L1s will be the same thing.  But the point I was trying to make is that that specification is arbitrary, i.e. not built into the pattern of steps at all.  So if you&apos;re talking about 4L+5s spanning the 2/1, that might be something related to Orwell temperament (at least, maybe in the strictly-proper range), but if you&apos;re talking about it spanning the 3/1, that&apos;s Bohlen-Pierce!  Same DE scale, different period, drastically different properties.  Since you want to name DE scale families after temperaments, the names will be period-specific, so you&apos;ll need sets of names for different periods, too.</p><p>&gt; Right... Well, first off, if you want to give all DE scales that fit<br/>&gt; the same imprint the same name, regardless of whether the period is<br/>&gt; 3/2 or 2/1 or sqrt(2), then what&apos;s the difference between 4L4s and<br/>&gt; 5L5s and 1L1s? What&apos;s the difference between 8L2s and 4L1s? 8L2s is<br/>&gt; just 4L1s, but you&apos;re mapping the period differently. You still<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t broken away from mapping.</p><p>Ah, but that&apos;s not true.  You only have to assume that all the scales you&apos;re talking about span the *same* period for 1L+1s to be different from 4L+4s.  You don&apos;t need to know what the period is, just that it is the same for all the scales you&apos;re looking at.  So the mapping doesn&apos;t actually need to be specified.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s another question: when people say that Blackwood is the 10&amp;15<br/>&gt; temperament, why is that okay? That&apos;s basically the same thing anyway,<br/>&gt; since &quot;10&amp;15&quot; can be turned into a corresponding MOS on the scale<br/>&gt; tree, right?</p><p>Well, note the 15.  As I&apos;ve hinted at before, once you get up to &gt;11-note MOS&apos;s, the range of generators is pretty narrow for most scales.  I personally don&apos;t think 10&amp;15 is specific enough for Blackwood, though, in terms of constraining the generators to make good 5-limit harmonies.</p><p>&gt; OK, but to be fair, you should at least admit that 1L5s scales that<br/>&gt; have a generator of 20 cents could probably be ignored for whatever<br/>&gt; naming convention that you come up with. While your example of the<br/>&gt; 7-limit porcupine-ish scale above was good (what is the name of that<br/>&gt; temperament?), 1\1 and 1\5 has a definite sweet spot.</p><p>1L+5s is between 1\1 and 1\6.  But yes, it does have a solid sweet-spot (in the 3-limit, anyway) just a bit sharp of 1\7, around 5\34 I&apos;d say.  And another one for 2.5-subgroups at a bit sharp of 2\13, around 5\31.  But yeah, generally speaking the sweet spot is between 1\7 and 1\6.  But (as I&apos;m sure you&apos;re aware from your frequent discussions with me) not everyone cares for the &quot;sweet spots&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Tangentially, I would personally support a hybrid naming system that<br/>&gt; gives credit to a temperament whenever it really does dominates a<br/>&gt; certain MOS, and comes up with a &quot;neutral&quot; name or a portmanteau of<br/>&gt; the winners when no clear winner dominates.</p><p>I could go for that, I suppose.  But I still don&apos;t see why, if you want to talk about a temperament, you don&apos;t just talk about the temperament.  Why go through all this trouble in the first place, when temperaments and DE scales are already clearly defined?</p><p>&gt; An interval is reversed when it gets mapped to a negative size in<br/>&gt; cents. So in 19-equal, for example, the Pythagorean comma is reversed,<br/>&gt; because if you go up 12 fifths and down whatever many octaves, you end<br/>&gt; up at a lower pitch than you started at. This is because meantones<br/>&gt; equate the diesis and the Pythagorean comma, and unless they&apos;re both<br/>&gt; getting tempered out as in 12-tet, one of them is going to be reversed<br/>&gt; with respect to the other.</p><p>Oh, interesting!  I&apos;ve been trying to get someone to explain to me what commas have to do with temperament boundaries like, FOREVER, and no one&apos;s told me this before.</p><p>&gt; So let&apos;s go to 12L7s scales vs 7L12s scales, and let&apos;s say you apply<br/>&gt; the meantone mapping here. The difference between a 12L7s scale vs a<br/>&gt; 7L12s scale, expressed in regular temperament parlance, is the<br/>&gt; difference between whether a diesis is smaller than a chromatic<br/>&gt; semitone or larger than a chromatic semitone. If the diesis is<br/>&gt; smaller, you get a 12L7s scale, and if it&apos;s larger, you get a 7L12s<br/>&gt; scale. If the diesis ends up being larger than a chromatic semitone,<br/>&gt; then the Natural Order Of Things has been broken: the difference<br/>&gt; between them, which is the magic comma, is now negative. And the<br/>&gt; boundary between 12L7s and 7L12s scales is 19-equal, which is a magic<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>Interesting.  So when an interval is reversed between two temperaments, is that when you get antiodromias when you translate music from one to the other (an antiodromia, if I&apos;m using the word correctly, is when majors and minors switch places, like between Mavila and Meantone).  I didn&apos;t realize this could be described in terms of commas.</p><p>So does that mean that you can describe all scales that share a common DE scale in terms of a common comma that isn&apos;t reversed?  Like, is there a comma that meantone and mavila share that explains why they have the same 5-note MOS?  If so, this might be a game-changer.</p><p>&gt; I brought all of this up and Graham then pointed out that this is<br/>&gt; isomorphic to when people refer to meantone as &quot;the 12&amp;19<br/>&gt; temperament.&quot; Why isn&apos;t porcupine the 12&amp;19 temperament? At least,<br/>&gt; that&apos;s what I was understanding his meaning to be. etc.</p><p>Yes, I know this convention.

I&apos;ve been trying to get someone to explain to me what commas have to do with temperament boundaries like, FOREVER, and no one&apos;s told me this before.</p><p>It&apos;s just something I realized recently. Apparently everyone has<br/>mapped this all out before, no pun intended. Graham&apos;s temperament<br/>finder describes temperaments like meantone in terms like 7&amp;12, and to<br/>do so is apparently somehow equivalent on a deep level to what I&apos;m<br/>doing, so to describe a regular temperament by two equal temperaments<br/>already assigns temperament names to entries on the scale tree, which<br/>is how it&apos;s always worked. The difference is, if we&apos;re not talking<br/>about there being a prime limit anymore, which mapping for 7 wins out<br/>for 5L2s scales in general? The temperament where 64/63 vanishes, or<br/>the one where 225/224 vanishes? There&apos;s no clear victor there, which<br/>is, I believe, the point you&apos;re making.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So let&apos;s go to 12L7s scales vs 7L12s scales, and let&apos;s say you apply<br/>&gt; &gt; the meantone mapping here. The difference between a 12L7s scale vs a<br/>&gt; &gt; 7L12s scale, expressed in regular temperament parlance, is the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between whether a diesis is smaller than a chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; semitone or larger than a chromatic semitone. If the diesis is<br/>&gt; &gt; smaller, you get a 12L7s scale, and if it&apos;s larger, you get a 7L12s<br/>&gt; &gt; scale. If the diesis ends up being larger than a chromatic semitone,<br/>&gt; &gt; then the Natural Order Of Things has been broken: the difference<br/>&gt; &gt; between them, which is the magic comma, is now negative. And the<br/>&gt; &gt; boundary between 12L7s and 7L12s scales is 19-equal, which is a magic<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting. So when an interval is reversed between two temperaments, is that when you get antiodromias when you translate music from one to the other (an antiodromia, if I&apos;m using the word correctly, is when majors and minors switch places, like between Mavila and Meantone). I didn&apos;t realize this could be described in terms of commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So does that mean that you can describe all scales that share a common DE scale in terms of a common comma that isn&apos;t reversed? Like, is there a comma that meantone and mavila share that explains why they have the same 5-note MOS? If so, this might be a game-changer.</p><p>Yes, but the results are kind of stupid. Meantone and mavila share a<br/>common mapping for 3/2, so the two commas there that must NOT be<br/>reversed are 3-limit commas, and they&apos;re 9/8 and 256/243. All along<br/>2L3s, these commas aren&apos;t reversed. When it is reversed, you end up<br/>with something that maps closer to father temperament. The boundary at<br/>which 256/243 reverses is 5-equal, which tempers out 256/243 and is<br/>hence a blackwood temperament, and the boundary at which 9/8 reverses<br/>is 2-equal, which is just another way of saying what you already know.</p><p>The common interval that reverses for both meantone and mavila when<br/>the 2L3s scale becomes improper is the 3-limit apotome, 2187/2048.<br/>Perhaps the best way to go, when naming MOS&apos;s is involved, is to pick<br/>the smallest temperament &quot;clan&quot; that contains most of the winners,<br/>such that the 7-note MOS would be called pythagorean or something, or<br/>some suitable name to suggest that the generator should be mapped to<br/>3/2, which is surely common among all of the victors in that<br/>temperament. Not sure how this would work for something like 1L6s<br/>though.</p><p>One interesting thing is that the 5-limit commas that flip as the 2L3s<br/>scale becomes improper are flipped for meantone and mavila - for<br/>meantone, as the scale becomes improper, 25/24 flips around, making<br/>major thirds minor thirds and vice versa. For mavila, as the scale<br/>becomes improper, 25/24 finally becomes un-flipped around, as 25/24<br/>would have to be reversed above that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2011 9:17:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So does that mean that you can describe all scales that share a common DE scale in terms of a common comma that isn&apos;t reversed?

What happens for a 1L6s scale, where you&apos;re<br/>bounded by 1-equal and 6-equal? The generator could range from<br/>anything up to 0 cents to 171 cents - what&apos;s the common generator<br/>there that yields the common interval that&apos;s reversed?</p><p>But at that point I&apos;d argue that there is really very little point in<br/>grouping all 1L6s scales together at all, because 1L6s scales with a<br/>35 cent generator really have very little to do with 1L6s scales with<br/>a 170 cent generator, I doubt there&apos;s going to be much melodic<br/>coherence at all there. How often are you actually going to use a 1L6s<br/>scale that has a 35 cent generator? For taxonomical purposes I have no<br/>problem throwing away outliers like that, but the situation might<br/>still get tricky in other cases. Are there times in which more than<br/>one mapping for the generator clearly makes sense across the range of<br/>a given MOS, under the -reasonable- size constraints under which that<br/>MOS will be used, and to pick one would be bad?</p><p>&gt; People have been telling me for the last year or so that there is no correspondence between temperaments and DE scales but you&apos;ve just demonstrated that there totally IS and that there is a sensible way to bound temperaments in terms of commas as opposed to error. For &quot;Bob&quot;&apos;s sake, there&apos;s a perfect taxonomy of scales staring us in the face and it&apos;s been here the whole time.</p><p>It still depends on you applying a reasonable mapping, however.<br/>There&apos;s no correspondence between mappings and equal temperaments<br/>either; sometimes more than one mapping can make sense for a certain<br/>tuning, as with 11/8 in 68-tet. The entire point of the regular<br/>mapping paradigm is to pick good mappings, though so I never<br/>understood the conceptual problem here.</p><p>I was all gung-ho about just picking the best mapping for a certain<br/>MOS and calling it a night, but you raised the good point that the<br/>2.3.7 64/63 &quot;superpyth&quot; and meantone both have nice little niches for<br/>5L2s. The saving grace here that makes it all work out, at least in<br/>the way that you want, is that they both share a common mapping for 3<br/>and 2.</p><p>But is it really the saving grace? To delve further into it, I&apos;d<br/>respond to it that they really -don&apos;t- have two nice little separate<br/>niches for 5L2s, because they both end up sounding very similar<br/>anyway. The superpyth supermajor triads clearly resemble mistuned<br/>5-limit major triads, and both the superpyth subminor and meantone<br/>minor triads are both high enough in entropy to sound &quot;minor&quot; anyway,<br/>although in both cases the constituent triads can be clearly<br/>distinguished. And, furthermore, triads like 4:6:7 are still decently<br/>recognizable whether you use meantone and the 6:7&apos;s are sharp, or<br/>whether you use superpyth and they aren&apos;t, so it seems like the clear<br/>winner here is dominant temperament, which conflates the two (at least<br/>the 2.3.7 subgroup version of superpyth I mentioned) and covers most<br/>of the spectrum. If we apply the dominant map to 5L2s, one simple<br/>interval that gets reversed as the scale flips from proper to improper<br/>is 50/49.</p><p>A corresponding analogy probably exists for the 7-limit<br/>pseudo-porcupine you mentioned earlier; conflate that with regular<br/>porcupine, and you have a reasonable mapping that covers most of the<br/>spectrum.</p><p>In the 11-limit, this breaks down, as there are now two clear maps for<br/>11/8, and whichever one you pick, 128/121 flips around as the scale<br/>becomes improper. It either goes from reversed to not reversed or vice<br/>versa depending on which map you used.</p><p>OK, so there&apos;s no clear 11-limit winner, but a clear 7-limit winner<br/>(dominant), a clear 5-limit winner (meantone), and a clear 3-limit<br/>winner (pythagorean). The 5L2s temperament assumes that 9/8 and 20,<br/>assuming that you map 3/2 to the generator. What name would you pick?<br/>Pythagorean, meantone, etc? I say run the zeta error algorithm on all<br/>of them and pick the winner, which will probably be meantone.</p><p>&gt; My question is, how did you work out the commas that get reversed? I&apos;d love to work out all the commas for maybe the first four or five levels of the Scale Tree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Crikey, Mike, this is brilliant! We can make a full taxonomy of scales this way, using a hierarchy of increasing specificity based on adding commas.</p><p>It still assumes that you can at least provide a decent map for the<br/>generator. Assuming you can at least do that, you can work out the<br/>intervals that are reversed based on that single generator. If not, or<br/>if an MOS exists where more than one mapping makes sense for the<br/>generator, you have to work out the reversed intervals in terms of<br/>nondescript variables like p and g, which you can then map out later.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2011 11:14:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you stick mavila and porcupine together, how do you get 15?

This, along with 256/243 (vanishing at 5-EDO) gives us the boundary conditions for 5L+2s, and explains why we can translate music between 19 and 22 and 26 and 27 and 12-EDOs (ad infinitum) based on a pythagorean structure!  3/2 works the same in all of them, so as long as we don&apos;t worry about 5/4 at all we&apos;re fine.</p><p>But then it gets a little more complicated.  I know the Pythagorean comma that vanishes at 12-EDO is reversed between Meantone and Schismatic, and I also know that at 12-EDO both the Schisma and the Syntonic Comma vanish (and that the Schisma does not vanish in Meantone, nor the Syntonic Comma in Schismatic) but I have no idea what (if any) 5-limit comma is reversed between Meantone and Schismatic.  But maybe that&apos;s irrelevant, because the Pythagorean comma ALSO happens to be very close to the difference between a major 3rd and a diminished 4th.

What happens for a 1L6s scale, where you&apos;re<br/>&gt; bounded by 1-equal and 6-equal?

Since the<br/>generator for both dicot and magic is ~5/4, there will also be<br/>corresponding reversed commas there too.</p><p>Here&apos;s something else to consider:</p><p>By itself, the rank-1 temperament consisting of a 100 cent generator<br/>actually means nothing. Is it 12-equal? Is it 13-equal with stretched<br/>octaves? Is it 24-equal with the octaves having 1200 cent error? etc.<br/>By saying &quot;12-equal&quot; we&apos;re already specifying part of the map, e.g. 2<br/>maps to 12 generators. In fact, no matter how large the generator is,<br/>even if it&apos;s 700 cents, if we map 2 to 12 generators, we&apos;re in<br/>12-equal as far as the map is concerned. So the phrase &quot;12-equal&quot;<br/>already specifies a map - a contorted 2-limit map, specifically. So<br/>we&apos;ve already jumped into regular mapping when we even talk about<br/>things like &quot;12-equal.&quot; And this is an undeniable fact before we even<br/>start figuring out what&apos;s a sensible map for 3, for 5, etc... it&apos;s<br/>part of the definition of &quot;12-equal.&quot;</p><p>OK, so by talking about 12-EDO to begin with, we are already at least<br/>specifying a 2-limit map. So what happens when we talk about an MOS<br/>scales, in which we also map the octave (let&apos;s assume we&apos;re just<br/>dealing with octave-equivalent MOS&apos;s for now, and deal with tritaves<br/>and such later - the math should still work out). So we&apos;ve mapped the<br/>octave, but we now admit that a second generator is present, so we&apos;re<br/>in rank 2. We don&apos;t map the generator to anything  - let&apos;s just call<br/>it &quot;g&quot; for now, but we bound it such that certain intervals, specified<br/>only in terms of &quot;g,&quot; must end up being reversed/not reversed.<br/>Depending on what mapping you pick for &quot;g,&quot; you end up with different<br/>such intervals. So if you can at least pick a sensible mapping for &quot;g&quot;<br/>for every MOS, you can then end up classifying temperaments that way.</p><p>But somehow, in some deep mathematical way, something else is going<br/>on, in that every linear temperament can uniquely be specified by two<br/>equal temperaments. So there&apos;s some deep stuff going on here that I<br/>don&apos;t fully understand. Well, two equal temperaments are also enough<br/>to uniquely specify an MOS, right? The simple fact that we&apos;re picking<br/>a mapping for 2 (or 3 if we&apos;re dealing with the tritave or whatever)<br/>seems to be enough for the math to work itself out in some deep<br/>mathematical group theory way that Gene and Graham seem to understand<br/>and I don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; So anyway, when we&apos;re looking at the 5L+2s range between 7-EDO and 5-EDO, it seems like we&apos;re not looking at 5-limit mappings. We can define a lot in this space by 3-limit commas, i.e. that at 7-EDO we&apos;re not worried about 25/24 at this level but actually 2187/2048, which vanishes at 7-EDO and is reversed on either side. This, along with 256/243 (vanishing at 5-EDO) gives us the boundary conditions for 5L+2s, and explains why we can translate music between 19 and 22 and 26 and 27 and 12-EDOs (ad infinitum) based on a pythagorean structure! 3/2 works the same in all of them, so as long as we don&apos;t worry about 5/4 at all we&apos;re fine.</p><p>This is because intervals with greater complexity tend to diverge more<br/>than those with lower complexity as the size of the generator is<br/>varied. If you&apos;re in meantone and you move the generator 5 cents, you<br/>end up moving 5/4 by 20 cents. So it works out that an awful lot of<br/>these scales have a common mapping for the generator which is most<br/>obviously sensible.</p><p>&gt; But then it gets a little more complicated. I know the Pythagorean comma that vanishes at 12-EDO is reversed between Meantone and Schismatic, and I also know that at 12-EDO both the Schisma and the Syntonic Comma vanish (and that the Schisma does not vanish in Meantone, nor the Syntonic Comma in Schismatic) but I have no idea what (if any) 5-limit comma is reversed between Meantone and Schismatic.</p><p>That would be 128/125, I think, right?</p><p>&gt; So the problem seems to be one of limits. When do you transition to the next prime limit? When do you use subgroups? It seems like we can&apos;t really map commas to the scale tree without some way of figuring this out.</p><p>Magic and fairy tales seem to be involved, since despite this<br/>seemingly obvious realization, two equal temperaments can somehow<br/>uniquely specify a linear temperament, which is clearly impossible,<br/>and yet it isn&apos;t.</p><p>I guess the fact that equal temperaments can often have more than one<br/>mapping is what reconciles this, although this usually happens more<br/>with higher ETs, not lower ones, so I&apos;m still stumped.</p><p>Perhaps one way to go is just to pick a clear mapping when it does<br/>exist, and not worry about any type of &quot;limits.&quot; So in porcupine, for<br/>example, 3 is usually mapped to 4 generators, which we can say with a<br/>clear head regardless of what we map one generator to. So if we at<br/>least specify a contorted 3-limit mapping we&apos;re moving in the right<br/>direction.</p><p>&gt; &gt; LOL, we&apos;ve switched sides, but now I&apos;ve seen the wisdom in your<br/>&gt; &gt; objections as well.

Another way to look at it is that dividing the patent val &lt;50 79 116 140| by 29 and reducing mod 50 gives &lt;0 1 4 10|, and putting that together with &lt;50 79 116 140|, saturating, and reducing to a normal list gives [&lt;1 0 -4 -13|, &lt;0 1 4 10|], which is meantone, which has a generator of a fifth. The Minkowski basis for the commas of &lt;50 79 116 140| is [81/80, 126/125, 16807/16384], and the [81/80, 126/125] part is meantone.

The 676/675 temperament has a<br/>pentatonic MOS, a 9-note &quot;diatonic&quot; MOS which I believe could be<br/>pretty useful for setting up a tonality, and a 14-note chromatic MOS.<br/>Blackwood has a 5-note pentatonic MOS, a 10 note &quot;diatonic&quot; MOS<br/>(blackwood[10] is clearly doing something closer to meantone[7] rather<br/>than meantone[12]) and a 15-note &quot;chromatic&quot; MOS, etc. When we talk<br/>about miracle, I&apos;ve heard it said about how you have to use more<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; harmonies, because the 10-note MOS doesn&apos;t cover<br/>everything.

I can&apos;t figure out if I&apos;m talking about three different<br/>things or one overarching thing here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>ALOE@...</h3><span>2/6/2011 11:14:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 01:08 AM 2/2/11 -0000, genewardsmith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Perhaps then the &quot;diatonic&quot; name could denote a specific scale size,<br/>&gt;&gt; e.g. somewhere between 7 and 10 notes, so we end up with the full name<br/>&gt;&gt; for 5L2s being &quot;Pythagorean diatonic.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;According to Wikipedia, &quot;diatonic&quot; means any mode of 5L2s.
