He plays, among other things, an upright bass<br/>with sympathetic strings that is just amazing.<br/>Unfortunately, the sole mp3 sample I could find is in no way<br/>as powerful as his bass work. Info about the album, and one<br/>non bass sample is at <a href="http://www.bazantar.com/">http://www.bazantar.com/</a></p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
