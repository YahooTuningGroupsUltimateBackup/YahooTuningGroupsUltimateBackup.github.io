Also, while I found a few truly different 10-tone<br/>minima, for 12, so far, I&apos;ve only found one real one (and some fake ones).</p><p>&gt;Perhaps there is<br/>&gt;something to be seen by looking at the problem with a coarser resolution<br/>&gt;which would smooth out the smaller lumps in the graph.  I&apos;m thinking of<br/>&gt;something like having the algorithm consider the results of a step of 5<br/>&gt;cents in some direction, rather than of .01 (or whatever) cents.  Then you<br/>&gt;could see if any other regions of the graph are worth considering.</p><p>Well I could always use various different starting points in order to find<br/>that out, and as I mentioned, I tried quite a few. Any suggestions?</p><p>&gt;Also:<br/>&gt;can you find an absolute minimum given some number of tones?</p><p>For up to 4 tones, this is feasible, since I can just generate a big array<br/>of values over a pretty wide range of intervals, and I already reported the<br/>results found from these arrays. For 5 or more tones, memory limitations<br/>kick in, so optimization algorithms are really my only hope.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
