Also, in other languages, &quot;Perfect&quot; is called &quot;Just&quot;<br/>(such as in Portuguese &quot;Juste&quot;) so you get a J5 instead of a P5.

Interesting powers of the progression reveal that it is not a common set of fractional numbers comprised between 1 and 2.

When the 3rds and 6ths<br/>were first admitted to this group in the 1300s, they were<br/>called &quot;imperfect consonances&quot;.</p><p>&gt; If it&apos;s correct,<br/>&gt; why are the treatises Yeary cites all about whether the 4th<br/>&gt; is perfect or not?</p><p>Yeary&apos;s paper is focused on the change of attitude<br/>towards the perfect-4th, it being originally a consonance,<br/>then later a dissonance. Of course, the quotes from<br/>his citations are deliberately chosen to support his debate.</p><p>Anyway, i&apos;m just trying to shed what light i can<br/>on the two different meanings of &quot;perfect&quot;.<br/>I don&apos;t have the time to go any farther with an<br/>argument about this -- digging up those citations<br/>already cost me a whole evening during which i should<br/>have been doing other work.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=85459 href="#85459">ðŸ”—</a>Tony &#x3C;leopold_plumtree@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2009 10:44:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Ok, so your argument is that 5ths have only one _consonance_<br/>&gt; in the diatonic scale, whereas 3rds have two.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This treatise provides the most comprehensive categorization of<br/>&gt; consonances and dissonances of its time, and the definitions<br/>&gt; within continue to resurface in treatises of the following<br/>&gt; century, most notably Franco of Cologne&apos;s Ars cantus mensurabilis.<br/>&gt; The fourth and fifth are given the status of &quot;medial consonance&quot;,<br/>&gt; below the perfect consonances of the unison and fifth, but above<br/>&gt; the imperfect *consonances* [emphasis added] of the major and<br/>&gt; minor thirds.
