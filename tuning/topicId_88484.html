Of course, saw waves have very strong harmonics all around...but you would have to EQ the saw wave first as most harmonics in a saw are of equal amplitude (they don&apos;t decrease amplitudes a lot toward higher harmonics and pretty much die out after the 7th or so harmonic as most instruments do)...you&apos;d have to custom-make such a sample for a timbre.  So realistically, I&apos;d recommending sticking with low attach high sustain guitar sounds.</p></div>
