Just like 16th-<br/>century JI and 12-pitch meantone (and even most forms of well<br/>temperament), it is centered around the pitch C, and by extension the<br/>CEG triad (or A and ACE if you want to think in minor). After all, the<br/>original European scale was the &quot;white-note&quot; scale, not the 12-pitch,<br/>and the accidentals - which raised or lowered pitches by 25/24 in 16th-<br/>century Italian treatises, just as they do in Ben&apos;s notation - were<br/>added to create extra ratios to those basic pitches, just as in Ben&apos;s<br/>notation. The further you move from that central C tonality, the more<br/>complex the accidentals get. I feel that because Ben&apos;s notation is<br/>grounded in historical European tradition, it has deeper roots and a<br/>more secure connection to earlier music than some makeshift system<br/>newly concocted for the 20th century. I also prefer to work in a<br/>musical universe with an implied center, no matter how arbitrarily<br/>chosen, than to refer everything back to an equally arbitrary scale<br/>like the 12-pitch Pythagorean.</p><p>The one counterintuitive thing about the notation is that, admittedly,<br/>D:A is not a perfect fifth, nor is Bb:F. Personally, however, I never<br/>had much trouble getting used to this one quirk of the system, and I<br/>kind of like being forced to remember that, in the key of C, D and A *<br/>aren&apos;t* a perfect fifth apart. (I&apos;d rather do that than have to<br/>remember that CEG isn&apos;t a major triad.)</p><p>How well the system works for performers depends on how complex you&apos;re<br/>trying to get. For myself, as Joe notes, I&apos;ve only used the tunings<br/>electronically. Ben has worked for years with getting live performers<br/>to play them, with varying degrees of success. His Chamber Symphony<br/>uses relatively simple ratios, but even there, I thought Eric Grunen&apos;s<br/>orchestra had a pretty rough time playing in tune. Ben&apos;s beautiful<br/>Sixth String Quartet uses massively complex ratios, and the performers,<br/>as I understand it, simply have to learn and memorize where every pitch<br/>lies on the string - the notation is no help to an intuitive<br/>understanding. On the other hand, the Fine Arts Quartet did a gorgeous<br/>job with Ben&apos;s 22-pitch, 7-limit scale in the Amazing Grace quartet.</p><p>Ben&apos;s notation encourages harmonic rather than melodic thinking, and<br/>his music always gives the players consonant pitches to tune each new<br/>note to. If you don&apos;t think harmonically, as David Doty and I<br/>manifestly do, the advantages of the notation may not be so obvious.</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3><a id=22034 href="#22034">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2001 7:57:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., kgann@e... wrote:<br/>&gt;...it is centered around the pitch C, and by extension<br/>the<br/>&gt; CEG triad (or A and ACE if you want to think in minor).</p><p>Hi Kyle,</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s accurate to say that it is centered around any note<br/>unless it is F^ (F-half-sharp).

Medieval French Pythagorean had all perfect<br/>fifths, and in 14th century music such as Machaut&apos;s, you see him trying<br/>to work major thirds into chords by every rhythmic subterfuge in the<br/>book. The 15th century&apos;s English-inspired acceptance of 5-limit tuning<br/>was, to my understanding of history, a major advance in theoretical<br/>honesty and a concession to what was already being done in practice<br/>anyway. Pythagorean may be an older tuning, but it was five-limit<br/>tuning through which the history of European music developed to its<br/>greatest potential. The tuning debates of the late 16th century took<br/>five-limit tuning as their basis, not Pythagorean. And Ben, like so<br/>many other mid-20th-century American composers (Partch, Cowell) picks<br/>up where the Renaissance left off.</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3><a id=22076 href="#22076">ðŸ”—</a>kgann@earthlink.net</h3><span>5/3/2001 9:07:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; 12-pitch meantone is usually centered around the fifth D-A:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Eb-Bb-F-C-G  D-A  E-B-F#-C#-G#</p><p>The intervals may be symmetrical around the fifth D-A, but the<br/>available keys are symmetrical around C.

Of course<br/>&gt; D:A was in tune - that&apos;s why meantone was adopted. But it&apos;s<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; that Zarlino&apos;s keyboard design, which (I&apos;m out of town and away from<br/>my<br/>&gt; reference books here, so forgive my memory if faulty) I believe<br/>dates<br/>&gt; from the 1580s, has the usual five-limit ratios for C, E, F, G, A,<br/>and<br/>&gt; B, and two different D keys - 10/9 and 9/8.</p><p>This keyboard design was very much an abstraction and Zarlino proposed<br/>2/7-comma meantone for keyboards performing the music of his day.</p><p>&gt; This hardly points to<br/>&gt; Dorian mode having equality with Ionian, but points to the second<br/>scale<br/>&gt; degree as being the problematic one - an intuition that must have<br/>been<br/>&gt; deeply grounded if it survived as late as Bruckner, no matter how<br/>&gt; idiosyncratic Bruckner was to still be sensitive to it.</p><p>Again, I argue that it&apos;s not a musical intuition at all, but only an<br/>over-theoretical invention arrived at only by those theorists who<br/>insisted on pinning strict JI ratios on each of the degrees of the<br/>major scale. Bruckner and Zarlino were two such theorists. My point of<br/>view is that adaptive JI or meantone temperament forms a better model<br/>of diatonic thinking by common-practice composers that strict JI. From<br/>1500 on, four fifths was always a consonant major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ben thinks the Fine Arts did a much better job, tuning-wise, than<br/>the<br/>&gt; Kronos.</p><p>Oh how, oh how, can I hear a recording of this?</p></div><h3><a id=22166 href="#22166">ðŸ”—</a>kgann@earthlink.net</h3><span>5/6/2001 12:55:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Well, I don&apos;t want to start splitting hairs, but I know my modes,<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; it was frequently acknowledged in publications of the day that the<br/>&gt; &gt; modal system, though still theoretically in effect, had pretty much<br/>&gt; &gt; fallen apart by the late 16th century, and left us with basically<br/>&gt; major<br/>&gt; &gt; and minor usage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter puts the date at about 1680, about a century later than<br/>&gt; you.</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t know who Margo Schulter is, but I&apos;ve taught Renaissance<br/>counterpoint with Josquin&apos;s works as a model, and I&apos;ve taught it with<br/>Palestrina&apos;s works as a model, and I don&apos;t see how anyone can deny that<br/>by the 1560s or &apos;70s, somewhere between Josquin and Palestrina, the<br/>modal system had been altered by chromatic inflections to be equivalent<br/>to the major/minor system.

General concerns: 5-limit notations and historical transitions<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Before getting into the deeper historical intricacies of 14th-century<br/>style and Pythagorean intonation (e.g. Machaut), or the fluid and<br/>often ambiguous modality of the late 16th and early 17th centuries<br/>based in my view mainly on a meantone model, I&apos;d like briefly to<br/>address the primary matter at issue in this dialogue, and also to echo<br/>your caution, Kyle Gann, about taking _any_ convenient date as a<br/>precise and absolute line or demarcation between two eras or<br/>approaches such as modality and major/minor tonality.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------<br/>1.1. Notational projects and historical precedent<br/>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>First, regarding notations for a system such as 5-limit just<br/>intonation (JI) where any solution will involve some compromises and<br/>arguable &quot;anomalies,&quot; I would say pragmatically that whatever people<br/>find most comfortable and convenient is best.</p><p>Since different people evidently find different notations most<br/>&quot;natural,&quot; some diversity may be the most reasonable or, I might say,<br/>&quot;ecologically&quot; appropriate solution.</p><p>If we are to take 16th-century musical notation as a precedent or<br/>model, however, then we encounter a complication: this notation, as<br/>used by composers and theorists including Zarlino (champion of the<br/>syntonic diatonic as a model of _vocal_ intonation), does not attempt<br/>explicitly to show syntonic comma adjustments or to distinguish 9:8<br/>and 10:9 whole-tones. Rather such adjustments -- however negotiated --<br/>are left implicitly to the performers.</p><p>Playing a 16th-century piece on a keyboard with a 15-note octave<br/>modelled after Zarlino&apos;s scheme, I must realize the notation by<br/>playing the right notes to make either G-D or D-A a pure fifth rather<br/>than one a syntonic comma narrow. Here there is _not_ a one-to-one<br/>correspondence between notation or spelling and the tuning system<br/>itself. Karol Berger&apos;s dissertation on chromatic and enharmonic<br/>theories in late 16th-century Italy nicely addresses this point.</p><p>Thus the project of developing a 5-limit notation which _expressly_<br/>indicates syntonic comma distinctions is something outside of usual<br/>16th-century practice, which seems to me most closely to reflect<br/>either meantone or some &quot;unwritten&quot; form of adaptive tuning<br/>adjustments for purer consonances. On this point, Paul, we seem much<br/>in agreement.</p><p>As to what system is best for such a project, I may not be the best or<br/>most informed judge, since I&apos;m accustomed mostly to what I term<br/>&quot;equitonal&quot; systems such as Pythagorean intonation, meantone, and<br/>neo-Gothic temperaments where all regular major seconds have the same<br/>size and a major third is equal to four fifths up.</p><p>If one is seeking a literal notation for classic 5-limit JI which<br/>keeps count of all the syntonic commas, then I might personally go<br/>with the Helmholz-Ellis-Wolf-Monzo system (HEWM), also used by Easley<br/>Blackwood (albeit as a critic rather than an exponent of this form of<br/>intonation).</p><p>However, if the Ben Johnston notation is comfortable for performers<br/>and helps them find the right notes, then that&apos;s fine, also.</p><p>Here I would emphasize that neither Johnston nor HEWM notation needs<br/>the ratification of any historical precedent: if the notational shoe<br/>fits the musical foot, then why not wear it?</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>1.2. Transitions and conventional dates<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>In response to Paul&apos;s accurate quote of my view that the transition<br/>from modality to major/minor tonality had become an established<br/>feature of &quot;modern&quot; practice by around 1680 (the era of Corelli and<br/>Werckmeister), Kyle questions the validity of giving _any_ precise<br/>date for such a transition, as well as proposing the late 16th-century<br/>era of Palestrina, say a century earlier, as a better estimate.</p><p>While saving the issue of modality in the late 16th and early 17th<br/>centuries for discussion below (Section 3), I would like very much to<br/>agree that any date such as 1680 is merely an arbitrary reference<br/>point for a process of transition.</p><p>What we have during the Manneristic era of around 1540-1640 or<br/>Rore-Monteverdi, in my viewpoint, is a fluid and very creative<br/>practice based on a 12-mode system both enriched and sometimes blurred<br/>by liberties including direct chromaticism and sometimes also<br/>diesisism (Vicentino). An important point is that the new inflections<br/>often fit _neither_ the &quot;classical&quot; Renaissance practice of a composer<br/>such as Josquin, nor the constraints of major/minor tonality.</p><p>By the third quarter of the 17th century, composers such as Stradella<br/>are moving in a tonal direction, so that one might place the<br/>transition somewhere around 1660-1680, with Corelli&apos;s music taken as a<br/>confirmation and consolidation of this trend.</p><p>One advantage of the approximate date 1680 is that it closely<br/>coincides with Werckmeister&apos;s publication of his well-temperaments<br/>(1681 and later), as well his views that only two basic modes (major<br/>and minor) were needed to describe modern practice. At the same time,<br/>this date also agrees with one 20th-century view of the major/minor<br/>period as ranging roughly from 1680 to 1900 (say Corelli-Puccini).</p><p>In my opinion, a balanced view of the problem should recognize not<br/>only that some elements introduced in the late modal practice of<br/>around 1600-1640 become usual elements of major/minor tonality, but<br/>also that some modal concepts remain important in the theory of around<br/>1700, when we would agree that tonality has clearly become the norm.</p><p>Similarly, to propose (as Mark Lindley does, very reasonably in my<br/>view) that the transition from Pythagorean to meantone on keyboards<br/>may have occurred sometime around 1450 is not to say that it happened<br/>suddenly in that precise year or even decade, but that clues such as<br/>the style of a keyboard composer such as Conrad Paumann suggest this<br/>epoch as a likely one.</p><p>Traditional &quot;great dates&quot; of historiography may be placed in fuller<br/>perspective without losing their significance. The year 1600 (or its<br/>surrounding decade or so), for example, continues to symbolize the<br/>import of such events as the new dissonance treatment of Monteverdi<br/>and his colleagues, or the advent of continuo-based forms, even if we<br/>choose to describe this transition as &quot;Early/Late Manneristic&quot; rather<br/>than &quot;Renaissance/Baroque.&quot;</p><p>To sum up, Kyle, I&apos;m much in agreement with you that any quoted date<br/>for a transition between two musical eras, styles, or tuning systems<br/>is at best a convention and convenience -- although a galvanizing<br/>composition or treatise may often provide a ready date _symbolizing_<br/>such a transition and making its flavor more tangible.</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>2. Pythagorean intonation and the 14th century<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>In this dialogue, Machaut&apos;s prominent use of major thirds was briefly<br/>mentioned, and I&apos;d like to comment in my view that this practice is<br/>quite consistent with the Pythagorean intonation described by<br/>musicians of the Ars Nova era such as his contemporary Johannes Boen<br/>(1357).</p><p>As long as thirds and sixths are treated as decidedly _unstable_<br/>intervals, often inviting standard cadential resolutions although<br/>often also used in a freer or more &quot;coloristic&quot; fashion, Pythagorean<br/>tuning fits such a role of &quot;imperfect concord&quot; or _relative_ blend.</p><p>An interesting passage in Boen explains the role of parallel thirds<br/>and sixths in approaching a cadence: these intervals serve as<br/>&quot;forerunners and handmaidens&quot; of the stable or &quot;perfect&quot; concords of<br/>the fifth and octave. Thus I find that a late Gothic idiom of this<br/>kind can be very pleasing in Pythagorean tuning, with C4 here showing<br/>middle C in a &quot;MIDI-like&quot; fashion:</p><p>A4 G4  F4 E4 F4<br/>E4 D4  C4 B3 C4<br/>C4 Bb3 A3 G3 F3</p><p>As Mark Lindley writes, the complex thirds and sixths give this kind<br/>of texture a &quot;sinuous&quot; quality.</p><p>In fact, I often enjoy passages of this kind in 29-tone equal<br/>temperament (29-tET) with major thirds and sixths somewhat wider than<br/>Pythagorean. Going much beyond this, however, some Setharean timbre<br/>adjustments may be in order to keep these unstable intervals<br/>_relatively_ blending; with such adjustments, 17-tET can also be<br/>delightful.</p><p>As Carl Dahlhaus has written, there is a neat correspondence between<br/>the &quot;acoustical surface&quot; of Pythagorean tuning and the musical<br/>style of the 13th and 14th centuries, with octaves, fifths, and<br/>fourths serving as the primary concords but various unstable intervals<br/>also playing a very prominent role.</p><p>By the later 15th century, however, there is a gap between Pythagorean<br/>theory and current practice -- although some students of this era have<br/>recently suggested that singers may have often leaned toward<br/>Pythagorean intonation in performances of composers such as Ockeghem,<br/>even as meantone keyboards were becoming the norm.</p><p>Notationally speaking, musicians finessed the transition by sticking<br/>with what one might call an intonationally generic and &quot;equitonal&quot;<br/>notation corresponding closely to either the old Pythagorean or the<br/>new meantone system, but not explicitly recognizing the complication<br/>of the syntonic comma for flexible-pitch performers negotiating the<br/>tertian styles now in vogue with thirds at or close to 5:4 or 6:5.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Modality, centers, and intonation: Vicentino-Monteverdi<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>During the era of 1540-1640, music is based on a very flexible system<br/>of 12 modes, sometimes freely ornamented and mixed together in manners<br/>advocated in the earlier part of this period by the composer and<br/>theorist Nicola Vicentino (1555), and in the latter part by such<br/>musicians as Claudio Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare<br/>Monteverdi (1607).</p><p>Here I would like to focus on the general question of accidentalism,<br/>the matter of Zarlino&apos;s experimental JI keyboard, and my views of the<br/>modes in practice around 1600.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>3.1. Accidentalism in Manneristic modality (1540-1640)<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In viewing the accidentalism of the 16th and early 17th centuries,<br/>including the direct chromaticism of a Vicentino or Gesualdo as well<br/>as the routine inflections taken for granted by Zarlino, it is very<br/>important to place this question in the perspective of earlier Gothic<br/>practice and theory.</p><p>While the accidentals Eb, F#, and C# -- in addition to the fluid step<br/>B/Bb (German H/B) of the regular gamut -- are in use by the era of<br/>Perotin around 1200, these inflections plus G# become a routine<br/>feature of the early Ars Nova in the era around 1300.</p><p>Such accidentals are frequently mandated by the pattern of &quot;closest<br/>approach&quot; -- the norm that unstable intervals should resolve to &quot;the<br/>nearest consonance.&quot; Thus a third expanding to a fifth or sixth<br/>expanding to an octave by contrary motion should be major, while a<br/>third contracting to a unison should be minor.</p><p>This convention calls for a regular use of _musica ficta_, &quot;invented<br/>notes&quot; outside the regular gamut of diatonic notes plus Bb.</p><p>In 16th-century modality, such inflections are one side of a modal<br/>system also routinely using accidentals by the 1520&apos;s to obtain major<br/>thirds above the lowest voice in closing sonorities -- the use of<br/>thirds in such sonorities becoming increasingly the norm.</p><p>From my perspective, at least, a balanced view of our Manneristic<br/>period from Rore and Vicentino to Monteverdi and Frescobaldi should<br/>take account of at least three factors:</p><p>(1) The modal system, including its creative ambiguities and<br/>affinities between related modes with similar species of fifths and<br/>fourths (or pentachords and tetrachords);</p><p>(2) The element of vertical sonority, now clearly shifted in practice<br/>and theory from the Gothic trine (2:3:4) to the _harmonia perfetta_ of<br/>Zarlino&apos;s &quot;third plus fifth or sixth&quot; (e.g. 4:5:6); and</p><p>(3) The often guiding role of &quot;closest approach&quot; and related<br/>progressions, some borrowed from the Gothic era, in directing the flow<br/>of saturated tertian sonorities.</p><p>Obviously a 16th-century system of meantone, or of adaptive JI with<br/>minute adjustments to finesse the syntonic comma while maintaining<br/>pure vertical concords, neatly fits item (2). However, musicians such<br/>as Netherlands just intonation advocate Peter van Marissing have<br/>suggested a more subtle connection between intonation and vertical<br/>organization.</p><p>In meantone, major and minor thirds are pure or nearly pure, and the<br/>late modal style of organization often features relationships between<br/>sonorities with lowest notes a third apart. Such relations are common<br/>in medieval chant and polyphony, but take on new aspects in a tertian<br/>environment, some of them involving striking forms of accidentalism<br/>including direct chromaticism.</p><p>At the same time, the late Gothic principle of &quot;closest approach&quot; also<br/>takes on new forms, as such a scholar as Carl Dahlhaus has found in<br/>his study of compositions around 1600.</p><p>Consider a progression in a setting in E Phrygian like this:</p><p>E4   F#4  G4<br/>B3   D4   E4<br/>G#3  A3   C4<br/>E3   D3   C3</p><p>8 -  10 - 12</p><p>Here there is no direct chromaticism -- the use of chromatic semitone<br/>steps -- but a use of accidentals producing three consecutive<br/>sonorities with what Zarlino terms harmonic divisions of the fifth<br/>(fifth plus major third above the bass).</p><p>From one viewpoint, we might focus on the stepwise contrary motion of<br/>the outer parts from octave to major tenth to twelfh. The smoothly<br/>conjunct motion prevailing has a &quot;late tertian/modal flavor&quot; of its<br/>own.</p><p>Taking the perspective of closest approach, we note that the first<br/>sonority is connected to the second by a major third expanding to a<br/>fifth between the lower pair of voices (E3-G#3 to D3-A3), and the<br/>second sonority to the third by a similar expansion of major tenth to<br/>twelfth between the outer voices (D3-F#3 to C3-G3).</p><p>Thus does a familiar 14th-century cadential progression take on new<br/>sonorous shape, Pythagorean intonation compellingly reflecting the<br/>original context, and meantone or adaptive just intonation the<br/>16th-century adaptation.</p><p>While the beauty of this progression speaks for itself, we might add<br/>from a free modal perspective that the motion of the bass E3-D3-C3<br/>connects the Phyrgian final E, the note of repose, with the common<br/>confinal or &quot;co-final&quot; C, often favored for intermediate cadences.<br/>This &quot;third-related&quot; connection is a delightful aspect of Manneristic<br/>practice sometimes inspiring boldly direct chromaticism.</p><p>For example, consider a progression like this:</p><p>A4 A4<br/>F4 E4<br/>C4 C#4<br/>F3 A3</p><p>Such idioms have a logic of their own, constrained neither by the<br/>earlier modal practice of a composer such as Josquin, nor by the<br/>major/minor key system established in the later 17th century.</p><p>In his analysis of Monteverdi, Carl Dahlhaus concludes that many of<br/>his progressions fit the &quot;closest approach&quot; paradigm mentioned as a<br/>basic element of counterpoint by such an early 17th-century &quot;modern&quot;<br/>as Agazzari in his presentation on continuo (1607), but not the<br/>expectations of key tonality, citing especially examples like the<br/>following:</p><p>E4  F#3          G4  A4<br/>B3  D4           D4  F4<br/>G#3 A3           B3  C4<br/>E3  D3     or    G3  F3</p><p>These progressions again involve the common expansion of major third<br/>to fifth in contexts where Dahlhaus remarks that major/minor tonality<br/>would suggest a different treatment. He comments that while<br/>conventional histories often look for instances where inflections<br/>seem to fit a &quot;major/minor&quot; pattern, they may disregard choices which<br/>seem to have the opposite effect, but fit the concept of &quot;closest<br/>approach&quot; as applied in a tertian setting.</p><p>At the same time, Dahlhaus emphasizes that such compositions do not<br/>conveniently fit either classic 16th-century modal theory or<br/>18th-century tonal theory. In their manifesto of 1607, the Monteverdi<br/>brothers themselves declare that this music belongs to a tradition of<br/>freely mixing modes in order to express the words and affections<br/>(i.e. emotions) of a text, an ethos for which we have an eloquent<br/>statement in Vicentino.</p><p>A &quot;polymodal&quot; approach to composers such as Monteverdi and Gesualdo,<br/>like any theoretical approach, must fall short of a full appreciation<br/>of the music, but seems to me both enticing and evocative, with<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; as discussed by Dahlhaus providing one historical<br/>foundation for what in the 21st century remains justly famed as a<br/>radically innovative style.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>3.2. Zarlino&apos;s JI keyboard and the modal system<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>As Paul Erlich has remarked, Zarlino&apos;s JI keyboard with its 16 notes<br/>per octave (including two versions of D, Bb, F#, and Eb) is presented<br/>by Zarlino himself as an experimental instrument, difficult to play<br/>and much less practical than a temperament such as his own 2/7-comma<br/>meantone.</p><p>The main conclusion I draw from playing a 15-note variation on<br/>Zarlino&apos;s instrument mapped to two keyboard manuals is that managing<br/>any piece in any mode that frequently calls for fifths at both D-A and<br/>G-D is likely indeed to be &quot;difficult,&quot; just as Zarlino observes.<br/>These fifths are likely to occur in any of the modes, not only in the<br/>obvious D Dorian or G Mixolydian.</p><p>For a few pieces calling for only one of these fifths (interestingly<br/>including a favorite D Dorian piece where G-D happens not to occur),<br/>or where in my two-manual arrangement the fifths or fourths in<br/>question happen fortuitously to call for the right hand at the most<br/>convenient time, this kind of JI can be as easy as meantone.</p><p>Otherwise, as Zarlino says, temperament is more practical; and he also<br/>observes that singers, unlike such special keyboards in the syntonic<br/>diatonic, can strive for pure consonances without the complication of<br/>&quot;small intervals&quot; such as the syntonic comma. Could this be a hint<br/>that adaptive JI was at least sometimes practiced?</p><p>Like his predecessor Glareanus, Zarlino favors a system of 12 modes,<br/>with an authentic and plagal form for each of six basic octave-species<br/>(D, E, F, G, A, and C).</p><p>From the perspective of either middle to late 16th-century practice,<br/>or of later developments, we may duly note that while in 1558 he<br/>follows the traditional numbering of the modes starting with authentic<br/>and plagal Dorian (Modes I and II), by the early 1570&apos;s he proposes<br/>giving the Ionian or C modes pride of place. This renumbering would<br/>follow the order of the natural hexachord C-A (C ut, D re, E mi, F fa,<br/>G sol, A la).</p><p>However, Zarlino is _not_ proposing a reduction of the 12 modes to<br/>two, or the abolition of the Dorian mode because the fifth D-A<br/>presents complications in a realization of his syntonic diatonic model<br/>on a fixed-pitch instrument.</p><p>Similarly, Zarlino groups the modes (1558) into two families based on<br/>the natural vertical division of the fifth above the final: in Dorian,<br/>Aeolian, and Phrygian (D-D, A-A, E-E), the arithmetic division<br/>prevails with minor third below and major third above (string ratio<br/>6:5:4); while in Lydian, Ionian, and Mixolydian (F-F, C-C, G-G) the<br/>harmonic division obtains with major third below and minor third above<br/>(string ratio 15:12:10).</p><p>He describes the harmonic division with the major third above the<br/>final as more &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;joyful,&quot; and the arithmetic division with<br/>the minor third as more &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;gentle.&quot;</p><p>This harmonic/arithmetic distinction is also expressed in the later<br/>contrast between major and minor keys, but under different musical<br/>conditions and with often different organizational structures and<br/>patterns.</p><p>While Zarlino proposes a renumbering of the 12 modes, incidentally,<br/>musicians of this and the immediately succeeding generation prefer to<br/>retain the customary numbering as expounded and expanded by<br/>Glareanus (1547).</p><p>The question, &quot;What is the center of the system?&quot; may be based on the<br/>premise that there is necessarily a specific &quot;center.&quot;  One might<br/>argue that there are multiple centers, depending on how one chooses to<br/>view the system at a given moment.</p><p>For example, the Dorian and Mixolydian modes might represent one kind<br/>of center, located midway between Lydian and Phyrgian in the set of<br/>modes (a distinct Lydian being least common in the 16th century):</p><p>   F     C        G          D        A       E<br/>Lydian Ionian Mixolydian | Dorian  Aeolian Phyrgian<br/>------------------------   ------------------------<br/>    harmonic division        arithmetic division</p><p>If we take account of Zarlino&apos;s harmonic/arithmetic groupings, then<br/>Mixolydian and Dorian are the adjacent members of the two groupings,<br/>sharing the affinity of an upper tetrachord T-S-T (T for whole-tone, S<br/>for semitone), D-E-F-G or A-B-C-D.</p><p>Of course, Zarlino&apos;s theoretical model of the syntonic diatonic and<br/>his renumbering of the modes suggest C as a center of interest, while<br/>going back to earlier medieval practice, one could argue on the<br/>concrete evidence of usual musical clefs that F and C, the diatonic<br/>notes located immediately above mi-fa semitones (C-fa or F-fa), are<br/>both salient points of orientation.</p><p>Applying solmization in a different way, we could point to the<br/>symmetry of Dorian as a special attraction, with two T-S-T tetrachords<br/>(re-mi-fa-sol):</p><p>D    E   F   G    A   B  C     D<br/>re   mi  fa  sol  re  mi fa   sol<br/>  T    S   T    T   T   S   T</p><p>The attraction of multiple centers both in theory and in practice<br/>lends much charm to the music of this era, along with the element of<br/>fluid degree inflection inspired by both melodic and vertical<br/>considerations often differing from those of later tonal styles.</p><p>The typical 12-note meantone compass Eb-G# nicely accommodates the<br/>usual accidental inflections of the 12 modes, with modal variety<br/>providing a rich system within a relatively modest range of<br/>transpositions.</p><p>It is in the late 17th century, when major/minor tonality becomes the<br/>established paradigm, that Werckmeister&apos;s well-temperaments serve to<br/>accommodate the greater range of routine transpositions compensating<br/>for the &quot;bipolar&quot; rather than &quot;multipolar&quot; world of the new system.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>3.3. Fluid modality in practice around 1600<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>As a very perceptive historian, Julius Lester if I recall correctly,<br/>has observed, debates about the &quot;modal&quot; or &quot;tonal&quot; nature of early<br/>17th-century music are inevitably colored by the viewpoints of the<br/>participants.</p><p>I have experienced this at first hand, when playing a piece from a<br/>German keyboard manuscript of this era identified as in the &quot;First<br/>Tone&quot; (Mode I, D Dorian) for a friend more accustomed to later Baroque<br/>music, and a far more skilled keyboardist by the way.</p><p>What I experienced as routine cadences or momentary focuses on various<br/>degrees of the mode, she noted as &quot;modulations.&quot; In other music from<br/>this period, she expressed surprise at events which for me seemed less<br/>remarkable.</p><p>Reading efforts of 20th-century theorists to &quot;explain&quot; progressions<br/>which seem to me a part of the usual late modal vocabulary also<br/>suggests that one&apos;s musical background and preferences may shape much<br/>of the analysis.</p><p>Recognizing these inevitable and stimulating differences, I would myself<br/>join with such authors as Arthur Merritt (_Sixteenth Century Polyphony: A<br/>Basis for the Study of Counterpoint_) and Knud Jeppesen (often cited by<br/>Joseph Pehrson in counterpoint-related threads) in viewing the music of<br/>Palestrina, Lasso, and Victoria as indeed modal, with an interplay of<br/>multiple centers which Merritt considers a special attraction of this<br/>period.</p><p>In composers of the early 17th-century era such as Giovanni Gabrieli<br/>and Frescobaldi, I can recognize, for example, &quot;Dorian&quot; idioms; while<br/>the Phrygian mode has its charms not only in vocal liturgical settings<br/>such as those of Victoria, but in keyboard music with a distinctly<br/>&quot;modern&quot; flavor.</p><p>Also, a radical musician such as Fabio Colonna (1618) demonstrates the<br/>transpositions of various modes, including Dorian with its symmetrical<br/>solmization, on his 31-note _Sambuca Lincea_ or harpsichord dividing<br/>each tone into five equal parts (a model suggesting a circulating<br/>1/4-comma temperament or the later 31-tET).</p><p>In proposing an often free intermixture of the 12 modes, or<br/>&quot;polymodality,&quot; as one standpoint from which to approach this era --<br/>and in 1655, Christoph Bernhard presents a 12-mode system while<br/>discussing many of the new idioms of Monteverdi and his age -- I would<br/>not wish to suggest that &quot;modality&quot; is the only or most important<br/>factor in this music.</p><p>Vertical euphony, closest approach, chromatic idioms, and sheer<br/>inspiration all play a role in giving this music its character. As one<br/>historian wrote of a different question, the &quot;medieval/Renaissance&quot;<br/>distinction, there is enough material here for advocates or &quot;modal&quot;<br/>and &quot;tonal&quot; analyses alike to keep busy for some time, and possibly to<br/>find inspiration for the creation of much new music.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=22244 href="#22244">ðŸ”—</a>kgann@earthlink.net</h3><span>5/7/2001 5:07:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again I ask: Have you read Blackwood&apos;s book?</p><p>No.</p></div><h3><a id=22248 href="#22248">ðŸ”—</a>kgann@earthlink.net</h3><span>5/7/2001 6:54:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>Thanks for your detailed exposition of the topics at hand, which I have<br/>savored and saved for future reference. I&apos;d like to repeat, not so much<br/>for your benefit as to sum up for others, the points I originally<br/>intended to make: that</p><p>1. The 5-limit premises of Ben Johnston&apos;s notation, mixing 5/4 major<br/>thirds and 3/2 fifths, have multiple precedents in late Renaissance<br/>writings and practice (no matter how many opposing views the<br/>contentious late Renaissance itself may have harbored);</p><p>2a. Ben&apos;s notation is centered around a C major tonality (a fact that I<br/>have been discussing with Ben for 18 years);</p><p>2b. There is a long European history in the 16th through 18th centuries<br/>of taking C major as central, evident in both the practice of tuning C<br/>and E as the central reference interval in meantone tuning (which Owen<br/>Jorgensen documents and recommends, though others may have started<br/>elsewhere) and in C:E being the narrowest third, and the closest to<br/>386.3 cents, in several well temperaments, though admittedly not in all<br/>of them.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t strike me that any of these assertions are contradicted in<br/>what you say or elsewhere; I regard 2a as uncontradictable, since Ben<br/>has the authority to say what key he centered his notation around. I<br/>will continue to prefer Ben&apos;s notation, not because it is easier for<br/>performers, but because it is centered in a tonality rather than in a<br/>string of intervals; and because this fact makes it more analogous to<br/>Harry Partch&apos;s monophonic system, which is based on G 1/1 of 392 cps.</p><p>I have, of course, enjoyed many of your writings before, and thank you<br/>again for this one.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=22266 href="#22266">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/7/2001 8:48:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., kgann@e... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again I ask: Have you read Blackwood&apos;s book?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No.</p><p>I highly recommend, if at all possible, you seek out his book</p><p>_The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_.</p><p>If you have access to a good library, you might find it.</p><p>Study it well -- it&apos;s not the friendliest read but more than rewards<br/>the thought you put into it.</p><p>From Benedetti to Barbour to Blackwood, there&apos;s a whole other side to<br/>the story that Ben tells.</p><p>And in Vicentino and our own John DeLaubenfels, we have a synthesis<br/>of the seemingly opposing points of view.</p></div><h3><a id=22280 href="#22280">ðŸ”—</a>kgann@earthlink.net</h3><span>5/8/2001 7:33:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:<br/>&gt; From Benedetti to Barbour to Blackwood, there&apos;s a whole other side to<br/>&gt; the story that Ben tells.</p><p>Ben was my mentor.

Every other year<br/>when<br/>&gt; I teach my tuning class, I use Benedetti&apos;s demonstrations for the<br/>&gt; necessity of temperament, and play examples of simple chord<br/>&gt; progressions shifting by syntonic commas. I realize Benedetti was<br/>not<br/>&gt; pushing JI, and I&apos;ve read Barbour. But with vocal music still so<br/>&gt; dominant in the 16th century, I cannot believe that just intonation<br/>was<br/>&gt; never practiced in Renaissance music.</p><p>I completely agree with you if you mean _vertical_ just intonation.<br/>Perhaps you are unaware that with Vicentino&apos;s proposals<br/>(specifically, his second tuning of 1555), we can overcome<br/>Benedetti&apos;s objections and preserve _vertical_ JI in the great<br/>majority of Renaissance music.</p></div>
