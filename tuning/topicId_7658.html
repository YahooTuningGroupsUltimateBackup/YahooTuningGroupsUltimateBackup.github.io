Most bounced it, but I received an email from the tuning list<br/>called &quot;no drift either&quot; (the subject of an email I sent to the list last<br/>spring, of which there is a copy in my outbox). I&apos;m not sure if that means<br/>that everyone got a copy, but if you did I apologize and I of course<br/>reccomend not opening any attachments. If this did effect anyone in anyway<br/>please email me and I will assist you in the relatively simple procedure for<br/>getting rid of it.</p><p>Once again, sorry &apos;bout that</p><p>dante</p></div>
