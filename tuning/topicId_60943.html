I looked for 12- and 24-note scales since obviously they map easily to conventional keyboards and are small enough to be actually playable.</p><p>I put up some scala files for those who want to try them out in practice.</p><p><a href="http://magnus.smartelectronix.com/scales/">http://magnus.smartelectronix.com/scales/</a></p><p>Here is the list of scales I found:</p><p>12 notes/oct:</p><p>[1,3] x [1,3,5,7,9,11,13]<br/>[1,3,5] x [1,3,5] x ~[1,3,5]<br/>[1,3,5] x [1,3,5,7,11]<br/>[1,3,5,7,9] x ~[1,3,5]<br/>[1,3,5,7] x [1,3,5,9]<br/>[1,3] x [1,3] x [1,3,5] x [1,3,5]</p><p>24 notes/oct:</p><p>[1,3] x [1,3] x [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]<br/>[1,3,5] x [1,3,5,7] x [1,3,5,7,9]<br/>[1,3,5,7,9,11] x ~[1,3,5,7,9]<br/>[1,3,5,7,9,11] x [1,3,5,7,9,11,15]</p><p>This list is not exhaustive and I&apos;m sure there are other nice structures too. All of these scales can be inverted to create (more) utonal versions, but I didn&apos;t make scala files for that because I prefer otonalities to utonalities.</p><p>- Magnus Jonsson</p></div><h3><a id=60951 href="#60951">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2005 8:26:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Magnus Jonsson &lt;magnus@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was playing around with the cartesian product scale concept I<br/>described<br/>&gt; about a month ago in the tuning list and I found a few 12-note and<br/>&gt; 24-note scales which have particularly appealing structures.</p><p>Does the tilde mean inversion?</p><p>I think it would make more sense to simply call these &quot;products&quot; and<br/>drop the &quot;cartesian&quot;, by the way.</p><p>&gt; [1,3,5] x [1,3,5] x ~[1,3,5]</p><p>This is John Chalmer&apos;s &quot;Major Wing&quot; scale if, as I presume, I am<br/>interpreting the &quot;~&quot; correctly.
