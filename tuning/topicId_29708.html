He told me that the test at jam sessions (in the old<br/>days), was to first be able to play &quot;Cherokee&quot; as fast as possible;<br/>then, be able to modulate it through all 12 keys at that tempo. If you<br/>could do that, you could hang with them...I have found the ability to<br/>modulate absolutely essential to be a good freelancer...Hstick</p></div>
