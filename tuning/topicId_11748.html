As if<br/>&gt; such a thing could even be done with some chords. Try tuning<br/>&gt; the beats out of a G13#11! But it sounds very nice in 12tET.</p><p>Hello, Patrick, and welcome to the Tuning List!</p><p>Go to:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/G13#11.mid">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/G13#11.mid</a></p><p>to hear 3 examples of me &apos;tuning the beats out of a G13#11&apos; chord,<br/>presenting it in both 12-tET and 13-limit just-intonation.</p><p>(The quality of what you hear in MIDI depends on your sound source.)</p><p>The pitches are registered as in a typical jazz voicing,<br/>using the minimum number of notes (= 5) that would identify<br/>the specific set of harmonic extensions you indicated<br/>(this &apos;minimum&apos; type of usage is typical of jazz, which you<br/>indicated as your background):</p><p>12-tET  note cents  ~cents to --&gt; harm(JI) ~cents<br/>------  ---- -----  ---------     -------- -----</p><p> 13th    E    900      -59           13     841<br/>  3rd    B    400      -14            5     386<br/>  7th    F   1000      -31            7     969<br/> #11     C#   600      -49           11     551<br/> root    G      0       0             1       0</p><p>1st, a piano timbre (no sustain or vibrato) plays the chord<br/>  in each of the two tunings.</p><p>2nd, a harmonium timbre (no vibrato) plays the chord in 12-tET<br/>  and sustains the notes as the 4 upper voices slide into their<br/>  respective rational slots.</p><p>3rd, a violin timbre (loads of vibrato) does the same.</p><p>In the voicing I used, the 12-tET tuning has the proportions:<br/>  2^(0/12) : 2^(6/12) : 2^(10/12) : 2^(16/12) : 2^(21/12)<br/>=    8     :  ~11.31  :  ~14.25   :  ~20.16   :   ~26.91</p><p>The JI tuning has the proportions  8 : 11 : 14 : 20 : 26,<br/>which doesn&apos;t entirely &apos;tune out the beats&apos;, but does reduce<br/>them to a mathematical (but not necessarily acoustical!) minimum.</p><p>Of course, there are infinitely many other ratios to which I<br/>could have tuned these harmonic extensions; this particular<br/>attempt results in what Paul Erlich calls a &apos;nice periodicity buzz&apos;.<br/>He used this term to characterize the sound of the JI version<br/>of my piece _Invisible Haircut_:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haircut/haircut.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haircut/haircut.htm</a></p><p>Perhaps the fact that I&apos;m already used to working with chords<br/>like this, tuned in JI, conditions my easier acceptance of them.</p><p>To my ears, and in contradiction to your opinion, the JI version<br/>of this chord is much richer and more sensual than the 12-tET version.</p><p>Notice also that each of the upper voices had to go flatter (while<br/>none had to go sharper) in order to attain the rational frequencies<br/>which describe the nearest harmonic &apos;fit&apos;.</p><p>Recent psychoacoustical research has shown that people tend to hear<br/>the most consonant intervals as wider (= upper note sharper) than<br/>the small-integer ratios.  The ubiquitousness of 12-tET for several<br/>generations now may be what accounts for this (if it is indeed<br/>caused by cultural conditioning, which it may not be).</p><p>I do agree with what you&apos;re saying to some extent, but (as with<br/>Paul Erlich) I would have chosen as an example a different kind<br/>of chord, most likely a major6/9.</p><p>This is a sonority that simply cannot be translated into<br/>small-integer JI because of the commatic &apos;punning&apos; involved.<br/>See the Tuning List archives for more on this chord and terminology.</p><p>And always be willing to stretch your ears and your mind, the two<br/>things we use when we listen to music!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
