<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>thanks for part one and shakti guitar</h1><h3>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;bval@iil.intel.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/1999 2:37:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>thanks for part 1 of the introduction to Fokker / periodicity<br/>blocks etc. I too look forward to the second chapter.</p><p>I have a little information on McGlaughlins guitar at home<br/>that I can post tomorrow. Besides the drone strings it had<br/>a scallopped fretboard to facilitate some of the Indianesque<br/>bending. I&apos;ll look it up, but it may be that the only thing<br/>more I&apos;ll be able to offer is the name of the luthier(s) who<br/>built it, or the theorys on which it is based (it has a<br/>&apos;new&apos; bracing structure as well).</p><p>For those who thought my admission of confusion was an<br/>&quot;anti-math&quot; statement, it wasn&apos;t. I&apos;m probably a couple of<br/>years behind the &quot;numerical&quot; discussions on this list,<br/>nonetheless, I have found that trying to understand them has<br/>expanded my knowledge, which is what I&apos;m here for.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
