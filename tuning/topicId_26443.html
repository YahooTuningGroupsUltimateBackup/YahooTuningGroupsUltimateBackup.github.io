Here&apos;s something I ran across while reading (for the<br/>zillionth time) &quot;The Martian Chronicles...&quot;   Two men are talking, about<br/>the ancient Martians...&quot;They quit trying too hard to destroy everything,<br/>to humble everything. They blended religion and art and science because,<br/>at base, science is no more than an investigation of a miracle we can<br/>never explain, and art is an interpretation of that miracle. They never<br/>let science crush the aesthetic and the beautiful.&quot; Yow...somehow, that<br/>relates strongly as to how I feel about music, and the exploration of<br/>tunings as applied to music. To each his/her own, but I don&apos;t think the<br/>miracle of art can/will ever be explained...just experienced, at<br/>whatever level we are capable of opening ourselves up to...Hstick</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 3:03:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just read something on a physics forum that I belong to that seemed<br/>particularly apt for replying to both Justin White and Neil<br/>Haverstick.</p><p>It&apos;s from an article by B. J. Hiley called _Non-Commutative Geometry,<br/>the Bohm Interpretation, and the Mind-Matter Relationship_.</p><p>B. J. Hiley was an associate of the late David Bohm, one of the<br/>deepest-thinking physicists and philosophers of the 20th century.</p><p>He came up with a concept called the &quot;implicate order&quot;, which,<br/>speaking very roughly, suggests an underlying structure to reality<br/>which is deeper than that we perceive through our typical categories<br/>of space, time, etc. -- and through which the many paradoxes of<br/>quantum mechanics may ultimately be understood. One common analogy<br/>used to convey the relationship between the implicate order and<br/>the &quot;explicate order&quot; (objects in space and time as ordinarily<br/>perceived/understood) is that of a hologram.</p><p>Anyhow, here&apos;s an excerpt from the article -- see in particular the<br/>last paragraph:</p><p>[snip]</p><p>&quot;What I have tried to argue above is that for quantum processes space-<br/>time is not<br/>the basic manifold in which quantum processes evolve. The basic<br/>process unfolds in this pre-space, which is not subject to the<br/>Cartesian division, res extensa-res cogitans. What I want to suggest<br/>that it is in this pre-space that mind and matter appear as different<br/>aspects of the same underlying process.</p><p>&quot;Thus mind and matter are united through mutual participation in<br/>which separation<br/>is not possible. They are two aspects of an indivisible totality, the<br/>implicate order.<br/>Aspects of this whole activity involve the process of thinking,<br/>feeling, desire etc. The dance of the neurons is only the outward<br/>material manifestation of these processes. These physical processes<br/>are merely an explicate order in which one aspect of the overall<br/>process is projected. By restricting our discussions to the<br/>electrochemical process of the brain, we miss the deeper implicate<br/>order which contains our experience of the physical and mental<br/>worlds. But even in using those words, it must not thought that there<br/>are two sides, mind and matter. Mind and matter are but different<br/>projections from this deeper implicate order where such a division<br/>does not exist.</p><p>&quot;We experience this implicate order directly when we try to explain<br/>to others how<br/>we feel or think. The words we use are only signifiers that seem to<br/>float on a sea of inner energy. We struggle for words to try to<br/>capture what is implicit in our thinking. But the meaning is not<br/>merely in the words, it is in the context in which those words are<br/>used. The context is often implicit and as we try to clarify this<br/>context, another, yet deeper context is assumed. But we can never<br/>make any complex set of ideas totally explicit. What we do is to try<br/>to create in the reader the implicate structure that we feel within<br/>ourselves.</p><p>&quot;Perhaps the clearest example of the role of this implicate order<br/>comes from<br/>listening to music. Listening is an active experience where we<br/>participate in the<br/>movement itself. We do not perceive a series of isolated notes. We<br/>hear new notes reverberating within the memory of the previous notes.<br/>This together with the<br/>anticipation of future notes constitutes an unbroken movement. What<br/>is apprehended, then, is an undivided state of flowing movement. We<br/>can argue that we directly perceive the implicate order because we<br/>become part of the total movement. We comprehend movement in terms of<br/>a series of inter-penetrating, intermingling elements of different<br/>degrees of enfoldment all present together.&quot;</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 4:44:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;Perhaps the clearest example of the role of this implicate order<br/>&gt; comes from<br/>&gt; listening to music.

J. Hiley both have a wider focus<br/>than the one you may have assumed they have.</p><p>Eugene Narmour has been the chief proponent of the<br/>&quot;implication-realization&quot; model of musical perception and<br/>analysis.  This model has a lot to do with what Hiley says in<br/>the part Paul quoted.  It does not necessarily argue for any<br/>&quot;single&quot; way of listening, but does present a convincing<br/>argument about the way a listener&apos;s mind posits expectations<br/>for continuance based on what it has already heard.  (Note<br/>that Narmour is one of the theorists Brian McLaren respects<br/>in his considered trashing of so many other music-theories.)</p><p>Schoenberg too realized that the subject must be taken into account<br/>for a proper understanding of musical perception, but he chose<br/>to ignore that aspect, explicitly *because* it is so highly variable.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said here *many* times before, the best book I&apos;ve seen<br/>which seeks to reposition the subject to its proper place in the<br/>consideration of harmonic theory is Richard Norton&apos;s terrific<br/>_Tonality in Western Culture_.  Both of you would probably want<br/>to read that, and it&apos;s widely available in libraries.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
