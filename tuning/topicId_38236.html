Even in the opening &apos;notes to the performer&apos; section, the accidentals are coming out as large lowercase letters, probably picking some font other than what you intend since it relies on the fonts. Either it was saved without embedding the fonts or... I&apos;m not sure what else.</p><p>&gt; Oh, oh... Do you have a PostScript printer??</p><p>Very few people outside of an office environment - and a graphics-oriented one at that - will have access to a PostScript printer, though there are 3rd-party apps that will translate.
