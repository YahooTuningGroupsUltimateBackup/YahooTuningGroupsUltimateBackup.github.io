Pointers to resources would be appreciated, though.</p><p>I&apos;d like to understand more about why we use prime limits the way we do in creating tunings, and specifically why we don&apos;t differentiate between primes in the numerator and primes in the denominator. It seems that this would involve discussion of how the harmonic series and overtones relate to prime limits.</p><p>The reason I&apos;m asking is that, at a surface level, it appears that having a 7/6 and an 8/7 would describe significantly different physical situations.</p><p>A 7/6 is 7/6 the frequency of a 1/1, which means it&apos;s 6/7 the wavelength. Physically, that means that I can get that tone if I stop a string 1/7th along its length.</p><p>Similarly, if I have a 8/7, I can get that tone if I stop a string at 1/8 of the way along its length.</p><p>If I stop a string at 1/8 of the way along its length, its endpoint is already a node (point of non-vibration) of the 1/1&apos;s 8th harmonic; its first harmonic has a node at (7/8)/2 = 7/16 of the way along the string, its second harmonic has a node at (7/8)/3 = 7/24 of the way along the string, and its third harmonic has a node at (7/8)/4 = 7/32. 16, 24, and 32 are all multiples of two, which means -- I may be being naive here, but this seems right to me -- that they relate to the fundamental tone closely: 16ths of the string length = 4 octaves, 24ths = 4 octaves + 5th, 32nds = 5 octaves.</p><p>If I stop a string at 1/7 along its length, its endpoint is a node of the 7th harmonic, but its first, second, and third harmonics are at nodes of (6/7)/2, (6/7)/3, and (6/7)/4 = 3/7, 2/7, and 3/14. None of those are as closely related to the fundamental tone in the way the 1/8 situation was: 7ths and 14ths of the string length only yield harmonic 7ths.</p><p>I know that not every instrument generates tones in the same way, but by the time a wavelength hits your ear, the compression wave could be modeled in a similar fashion.</p><p>So it seems to me that not all prime limits are created equal: The 8/7 should seem more closely related to 1/1 than 7/6 should, or at least more closely than its Tenney Height suggests, and in consonance measures like Tenney Height we should handle prime factors in the numerator differently from prime factors in the denominator.</p><p>Incidentally, that could fit with 16/9, being 2-limit in the numerator and 3-limit in the denominator, sounding &quot;more normal&quot; (Michael&apos;s words) than 7/4, and 15/8 sounding not much worse than 11/6 despite the fact that it&apos;s double the Tenney Height.</p><p>This is about as far as I&apos;ve thought this out. Does anyone know where this has been discussed before, or have any opinions on the matter?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=98327 href="#98327">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2011 6:35:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Apr 21, 2011 at 1:30 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I stop a string at 1/8 of the way along its length, its endpoint is<br/>&gt; already a node (point of non-vibration) of the 1/1&apos;s 8th harmonic; its<br/>&gt; first harmonic has a node at (7/8)/2 = 7/16 of the way along the string,</p><p>7/16 of the way along the string from the bridge, you mean. From the<br/>nut, it&apos;d be 1/8 + (7/8)/2 = 9/16, unless I&apos;m misunderstanding<br/>something. Also, to eliminate mass chaos and panic, the convention is<br/>to generally refer to the octave as the second harmonic around these<br/>parts, because otherwise everyone gets extraordinarily confused.</p><p>&gt; its second harmonic has a node at (7/8)/3 = 7/24 of the way along the<br/>&gt; string, and its third harmonic has a node at (7/8)/4 = 7/32.</p><p>Likewise with the above, you end up with 1/8 + (7/8)/3 = 10/24 = 5/12<br/>of the way along the string, and also 1/8+(7/8)/4 = 11/32 of the way<br/>along the string.</p><p>&gt; 16, 24, and 32 are all multiples of two, which means -- I may be being naive here,<br/>&gt; but this seems right to me -- that they relate to the fundamental tone<br/>&gt; closely: 16ths of the string length = 4 octaves, 24ths = 4 octaves +<br/>&gt; 5th, 32nds = 5 octaves.</p><p>That the 8th harmonic of 1/1 and the second harmonic of 8/7 share a<br/>node on a string isn&apos;t, I don&apos;t think, something that&apos;s going to<br/>affect the consonance and dissonance of intervals. This just stems<br/>from the fact that 1/1 and 8/7 are both undertones of 8/1, so you&apos;ve<br/>rediscovered utonal intervals.</p><p>&gt; I know that not every instrument generates tones in the same way, but by<br/>&gt; the time a wavelength hits your ear, the compression wave could be<br/>&gt; modeled in a similar fashion.</p><p>How do you see this as being related to the resulting compression wave?</p><p>&gt; So it seems to me that not all prime limits are created equal: The 8/7<br/>&gt; should seem more closely related to 1/1 than 7/6 should, or at least<br/>&gt; more closely than its Tenney Height suggests, and in consonance measures<br/>&gt; like Tenney Height we should handle prime factors in the numerator<br/>&gt; differently from prime factors in the denominator.</p><p>It seems like what you want is a measure of consonance such that any<br/>interval and its utonal equivalent are rated as being equal. Some sort<br/>of octave-equivalent Tenney Height where you remove all powers of two<br/>would handle that well enough. So 8/7 would reduce to 1/7, and would<br/>have Tenney Height equivalent to 7/4, which would also reduce to 7/1.<br/>But once you get away from dyads, I don&apos;t think things will work quite<br/>as smoothly.</p><p>&gt; Incidentally, that could fit with 16/9, being 2-limit in the numerator<br/>&gt; and 3-limit in the denominator, sounding &quot;more normal&quot; (Michael&apos;s words)<br/>&gt; than 7/4, and 15/8 sounding not much worse than 11/6 despite the fact<br/>&gt; that it&apos;s double the Tenney Height.</p><p>I don&apos;t see how it fits in, can you explain?</p><p>&gt; This is about as far as I&apos;ve thought this out.

What, exactly, would you expect to get out of distinguishing primes in the numerator from primes in the denominator, other than in chord construction, where you might want all your 5s or 7s in one or the other?
