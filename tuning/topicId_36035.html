I therefore feel that<br/>those with poor intonation sense have simply not &quot;objectified&quot; their<br/>ears in this way and thus easily fall prey to whatever psychoacoustic<br/>anomolies might assail them.</p><p>&quot;There are without any doubt, as I see it, psychoacoustic phenomena<br/>that predispose naive ears towards perceptions that do not support<br/>miminum tuning dissonance in the context of harmony, i.e., JI<br/>harmony. Yet the tuning dissonances that arise in sufficiently non-JI<br/>harmonies do not go away simply because some of these phenomena<br/>predispose the ear away from JI.&quot;</p><p>Bob now:<br/>I think this is the most succinct summary I can offer regarding the<br/>conclusions that for me are inevitable in the context of my personal<br/>experience with precise tuning over many years, both with fixed pitch<br/>keyboard and dynamically tunable instruments such as violin and<br/>voice. The implications of these conclusions for the &quot;high third&quot;<br/>phenomenon under current discussion should be obvious. The re-<br/>injection of the compensatory stand-alone high third (actually high)<br/>into the root and fifth sounds terrible to me (not just in theory,<br/>but literally in terms of sound).</p><p>The idea itself also defies any logical paradigm to which I can<br/>personally subscribe. After all, here we are taking a perceptual<br/>anomaly that does not accord with any objectively measurable<br/>phenomenon, namely the apparent lowering of the stand-alone third,<br/>and compensating for its apparent lowness by raising it literally in<br/>terms of objective frequency, and then injecting this literally<br/>higher third back into a context in which it **ALREADY** sounds<br/>higher subjectively! How can we propose that this will accomplish<br/>anything but the exaggeration of an already deceptive perceptual<br/>anomaly?!?!</p><p>I sincerely did not expect my perception of this anomaly to go away<br/>(in Jerry00), but it surprised me by doing so anyway. Although it is<br/>not necessary to the points I just made above, for me this further<br/>confirms what my previous long history in dealing with such things<br/>has taught me, namely that the the ear does indeed learn to ignore or<br/>at least compensate in some way these perceptual anomalies over time,<br/>just as in sports, in order to become successful in certain contexts,<br/>experience has to impart the ability to null out optical illusions<br/>and other deceptive perceptual anomalies in order to respond<br/>accurately with our aim, or other physically objective, result-<br/>oriented responses.</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2002 2:43:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The idea itself also defies any logical paradigm to which I can<br/>&gt; personally subscribe.

Can you try to match what you&apos;re<br/>&gt; singing with the pitch bend wheel?</p><p>I&apos;ve tried that in the past, Carl, with little success. My understanding is<br/>that my M-1 moves pitches in whole cents. I suspected that we would need<br/>something more sensitive than that to find the actual pitch of the  &quot;high<br/>third.&quot; That&apos;s why Paul has and is preparing some listening examples that<br/>explore differences finer than one cent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rt-add5-adj.mpeg<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t really notice anything here.</p><p>The question is: does the pitch of the third move in response to the<br/>inclusion of the fifth.

Capital Records wasn&apos;t available that day. :-)</p><p>&gt; Indeed, on the first check the piano seems sharp, and not on the second.</p><p>That is the &quot;expected&quot; perception since the girls are singing a 4:5 third<br/>to the basses at that point. (Unfortunately, the basses immediately lifted<br/>the pitch given to them at the outset, so no accurate measurement can be<br/>made from this recording (even if it were a good one).</p><p>At the second check, the tenors have entered, causing (I believe) the pitch<br/>of the women&apos;s third to sound (be?) higher than ET, thus giving the<br/>perceptual impression that the piano has moved while in fact that cannot be<br/>the case. The logical conclusion is that the women&apos;s pitch has moved, or at<br/>least appears to have moved. That&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to discover.</p><p>&gt; But I can hardly hear a thing.  And we don&apos;t know the basses and<br/>&gt; tenors haven&apos;t gone sharp too?</p><p>They have, but once the pitch is established before the women enter, the<br/>root/fifth stays steady.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But most importantly: Can the singers hear the piano!?<br/>&gt; This experiment should be done just so, and later the<br/>&gt; piano track could be added.</p><p>What a great idea, Carl. That way there can be no influence to the women to<br/>consciously move the pitch before the tenors enter with the fifth. Hear<br/>that, Bob? Record the voices from a given pitch and dub in the reference<br/>pitches later.
