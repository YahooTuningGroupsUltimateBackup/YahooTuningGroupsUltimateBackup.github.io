What kind of near just intervals 11tet close to?</p><p>Recently John A. deLaubenfels posted a tuning math tutorial which<br/>contained the following:</p><p>&quot;To convert cents interval to frequency ratio:</p><p>   Freq_ratio = 2 ^ (delta_cents / 1200)</p><p>That&apos;s &quot;two to the power&quot;.  Again, do an example: a 12-tET minor<br/>third, 3 semitones or 300 cents, divided by 1200 gives 0.25 (octaves).<br/>Two (2.0) raised to that power gives 1.1892; compare to 1.2000 for a<br/>perfect 6/5 minor third ratio.&quot;</p><p>This shows one way to quickly answer this sort of a &apos;what kind of near<br/>just intervals is such and such equal division of the octave close to&apos;<br/>question... By taking sequential multiples of the frequency ratio and<br/>rounding<br/>them to the nearest integer (e.g., using John&apos;s 0.25 quarter of an<br/>octave example, 1:1.1892 becomes 1/1, 2:2.3784 becomes 2/2, 3:3.5676<br/>becomes 4/3, etc.), and then choosing some simple criteria for<br/>matching the fraction of an octave to one of these rounded ratios - I<br/>think that the first difference between the numerators of the<br/>sequential multiples and the rounded integers to round to 0.0 is a<br/>simple enough criteria.</p><p>As the intervals of equal divisions of the octave all (save the<br/>half-octave) have an exact mirror inversion (or complement), if you<br/>carry this process past the half-octave,* 0.0 no longer has the same<br/>meaning - so this process need not be carried out past the<br/>half-octave... In 11e that would mean 1/1, 16/15, 17/15, 6/5, 9/7,<br/>11/8, and their inversions 16/11, 14/9, 5/3, 30/17, 15/8, 2/1 would<br/>all fulfill the (simple but arbitrary) 0.0 criteria.</p><p>While this type of a fraction of an octave into interval ratios rarely<br/>if ever sounds any better (or to some, any different) than the<br/>original equal divisions of the octaves, it can offer some simple ways<br/>to start _seeing_ and manipulating certain relationships between the<br/>two.</p><p>Dan<br/>_________<br/>*For what needs doing here you could use n/[(log24-log17)*(12/log2)],<br/>where &quot;n&quot; is the equal division of the octave.</p></div>
