To that extent, how much you want to restrict your prime and odd limits depends on how you want to use the resulting pitches.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings to light another point about register...the critical band (on an exponential/not-linear scale) becomes smaller at higher octaves thus allowing more clustered chord at higher octaves with a similar sense of resolve.&nbsp;</p><p>-----------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, (an extra point for Igs&apos;s list), critical band, I&apos;ve found, plays a major role in chords.&nbsp; Stacking 16/15 or smaller intervals, for example, is often a sure-fire way to produce a level of dissonance beyond the scope of most listeners.<br/>&nbsp; If you have a 16/15 or small semitone, you usually have to space the intervals around it pretty widely to make it sound balanced (usually somewhere in between 9/8 and 6/5 distance between any other dyad in the chord).</p><p>&nbsp; And I&apos;ve found you can have stacked 12/11&apos;s in a tetrad...but the third small dyadic gap must be more like 6/5 or over to compensate.&nbsp; So 12/11 gives you a bit more slack...but not that much.&nbsp; For example 10:11:12:14 and 9:10:11:12.</p><p>&nbsp; It really seems to level out when you stack 8/7 and 7/6-like intervals into a chord so far as critical band IE 1/1 * 8/7 * 7/6 * 8/7 or 1 4/3 14/9 16/9 AKA 9:12:14:16...that&apos;s the one case where you can stack &quot;wide&quot; semi-tones ad-nauseam and still get balanced chords.</p></div>
