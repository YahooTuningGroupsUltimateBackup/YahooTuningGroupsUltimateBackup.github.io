Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2000 9:06:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt; &gt; A true triadic or tetradic<br/>&gt; &gt;harmonic entropy model (rather than a sum of dyadic harmonic<br/>entropy<br/>&gt; &gt;models, which is what this is) would take this into account.&quot;</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&gt;So, would this be possible to do??... or is it too difficult to model<br/>&gt;mathematically?</p><p>A few months ago I posted some ideas and graphs involving Voronoi cells (see<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg</a>) which would be an approach<br/>to solving this problem. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t do the calculations at the<br/>moment, because, though Matlab can give you the set of line segments making<br/>up the full spread of Voronoi cells for a set of points, it provides no way<br/>to then find just the edges of the Voronoi cell corresponding to a single,<br/>selected point. Perhaps I just need the help of a clever programmer on this<br/>list . . .</p><p>&gt;And, how different would it be than the<br/>&gt;diadically-inspired model that Paul just did??</p><p>Quite different -- most notably, observe how the model I just presented<br/>gives any chord the same rating as its mirror &quot;inversion&quot;. So utonal and<br/>otonal chords of the same identities come out with the same rating. The true<br/>chordal harmonic entropy model would find the otonal chord to be more<br/>concordant (lower entropy) than the utonal chord. Look at<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg</a>. The three red dots are the<br/>major triad, in root position, first inversion, and second inversion. The<br/>three blue dots are the minor triad, in root position, first inversion, and<br/>second inversion. Notice how the red dots have more space around them than<br/>the blue dots. Just as in the diadic case, where simple ratios have more<br/>space around them than complex ratios, here the major triads have more space<br/>around them than the minor triads. This has got to be related (though I<br/>don&apos;t have a proof) to the fact that the major triads (4:5:6, 5:6:8, 3:4:5)<br/>use simpler numbers than the minor triads (10:12:15, 12:15:20, 15:20:24)<br/>when expressed otonally, and remember, it is the otonal representation that<br/>is relevant for harmonic entropy -- since harmonic entropy means &quot;how hard<br/>it is for the brain&apos;s central pitch processor to pin down the fundamental of<br/>the harmonic series that the chord comes from&quot;.</p></div>
