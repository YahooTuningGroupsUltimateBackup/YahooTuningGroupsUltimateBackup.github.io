I have some experience with Verhulst dynamics, and<br/>though I&apos;ve seen the bifurcation plot many times, I&apos;ve never heard it. I&apos;m<br/>sure a blind person could visualize it if they heard this. It would be<br/>interesting to hear further along in one of the &quot;windows&quot; where the number<br/>of attractors turns suddenly from nearly infinite to, say, three. I think it<br/>would probably become more and more confused and dissonant until you almost<br/>couldn&apos;t stand it any more and then everything would suddenly be much<br/>simpler, if not exactly consonant (though I wonder...).</p><p>How many iterations did you use? Or did you use some method that doesn&apos;t<br/>involve iterations? And what are those little pops in the middle, that sound<br/>like changing notes? And those extra staccato notes at the end?</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan P.</p></div>
