And also the minor triad<br/>intervals themselves are individually still 5:6 and 4:5 yet the chord can<br/>not be spelled anymore using the numbers 4,5,6, so this is another<br/>indication that something is quite different from the situation in a<br/>harmonic chord.</p><p>There was a thread about this in relation to why minor chords are &quot;sad&quot;<br/>several months back.  It makes sense to me that without the harmonic<br/>reinforcement it is much like the individual intervals are &quot;lonely&quot; rather<br/>than really forming a single harmony.

If you flip the intervals in<br/>a &quot;harmonic<br/>&gt; chord&quot; (also called otonal) top-to-bottom then in the resulting<br/>chord<br/>&gt; (called utonal) the difference tones don&apos;t tend to coincide and<br/>reinforce<br/>&gt; each other as they do in an otonal chord.  But the otonal/utonal<br/>distinction<br/>&gt; is a little ambiguous and depends on the numbers involved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example the major triad 4:5:6 consists of 4:5 below 5:6 and<br/>flipped this<br/>&gt; becomes the minor triad, with a 4:5 above a 5:6 which is no longer<br/>obviously<br/>&gt; a harmonic chord.  Actually 4:5:6 flipped can be spelled as<br/>1/6:1/5:1/4 [or<br/>&gt; abbreviated as 1/(6:5:4)], a utonal spelling, but can also be<br/>spelled (by<br/>&gt; multiplying by 60) as 10:12:15 which is also a harmonic (otonal)<br/>spelling.<br/>&gt; But the numbers are higher in the otonal spelling and so the<br/>harmonic aspect<br/>&gt; is less clear and the chord is more likely to be considered utonal<br/>because<br/>&gt; the utonal spelling involves lower numbers.  And also the minor<br/>triad<br/>&gt; intervals themselves are individually still 5:6 and 4:5 yet the<br/>chord can<br/>&gt; not be spelled anymore using the numbers 4,5,6, so this is another<br/>&gt; indication that something is quite different from the situation in a<br/>&gt; harmonic chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There was a thread about this in relation to why minor chords<br/>are &quot;sad&quot;<br/>&gt; several months back.  It makes sense to me that without the harmonic<br/>&gt; reinforcement it is much like the individual intervals are &quot;lonely&quot;<br/>rather<br/>&gt; than really forming a single harmony.  Yet the same intervals may<br/>be present<br/>&gt; as are present in a harmonic chord, so there is still a sense of<br/>harmony,<br/>&gt; just a different kind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So for the difference tones, 4:5:6 produces difference tones of<br/>1,1, and 2,<br/>&gt; reinforcing the fundamental and the octave.  But 10:12:15 produces<br/>&gt; difference tones of 2, 3, and 5 and so reinforcement is scattered.<br/>This<br/>&gt; becomes even clearer in bigger chords:  4:5:6:7 has even stronger<br/>&gt; reinforcement whereas 1/(7:6:5:4) again has scattered difference<br/>tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably other people on the list can offer other ways of<br/>describing this.<br/>&gt; You can also talk about an implied fundamental, which I didn&apos;t get<br/>into for<br/>&gt; lack of time at the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Kurt</p></div><h3>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2004 12:25:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Detune the just chord until the implied fundamental (or whatever<br/>you want to<br/>&gt; call it) is no longer there.

So that is the highest common harmonic of the<br/>&gt; *fundamentals* of the notes appearing in the chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or perhaps it will make it more obvious if I name a chord.  Take<br/>the 4:5:6:7<br/>&gt; as the otonal example.  The implied fundamental is the 1.  You<br/>could add<br/>&gt; that to the chord and have 1:4:5:6:7.  On the utonal side take 1/<br/>(7:6:5:4).<br/>&gt; The &quot;analog&quot; to what I called the implied fundamental is again the<br/>1.  You<br/>&gt; could add it to the chord and have 1/(7:6:5:4:1).  Curious how hard<br/>it was<br/>&gt; to name that &quot;1&quot; in the otonal case.  There is no name for the 1 in<br/>the<br/>&gt; utonal case, right?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Wow... I win bingo.

The fact that<br/>undertone series<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as scales can be more easily constructed by man than overtone<br/>series as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scales is also undeniable. The fact that utonal chords have a<br/>lower<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first common overtone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of what consequence is a first common overtone?  Do you ever hear<br/>it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a greater rate of occurence of higher common<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overtones,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I thought I&apos;d heard Paul Erlich say elsewhere something to the<br/>effect<br/>&gt; that the significance of common overtones is not clear.  At least<br/>I&apos;m pretty<br/>&gt; sure he said that the highest common overtone (what would in an<br/>utonal chord<br/>&gt; be *analogous* to the implied fundamental of an otaonal chord) is<br/>not<br/>&gt; *heard*.  But I can&apos;t find the reference, as usual!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; There was a thread about this in relation to why minor chords<br/>are &quot;sad&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; several months back.  It makes sense to me that without the<br/>harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; reinforcement it is much like the individual intervals<br/>are &quot;lonely&quot; rather<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; than really forming a single harmony.  Yet the same intervals<br/>may be present<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as are present in a harmonic chord, so there is still a sense of<br/>harmony,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; just a different kind.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Exactly.  But the missing part doesn&apos;t have to do with partials<br/>(in<br/>&gt; &gt; my version of the thesis), but rather the virtual pitch mechanism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet the virtual pitch mechanism has *something* to do with the<br/>implied<br/>&gt; fundamental and the implied fundamental in otonal chords is often<br/>way too<br/>&gt; low to be in the audible range.  So the missing part could<br/>conceivably be<br/>&gt; the audible implied fundamental.  However in the case of off-just<br/>chords<br/>&gt; this may be missing yet the otonal kind of harmony may seem to<br/>remain, so<br/>&gt; now I am wonderining.  But on the other hand what does the virtual<br/>pitch<br/>&gt; mechanism have to do with an off-just otonal chord?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; So for the difference tones, 4:5:6 produces difference tones of<br/>1,1, and 2,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; reinforcing the fundamental and the octave.  But 10:12:15<br/>produces<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; difference tones of 2, 3, and 5 and so reinforcement is<br/>scattered.  This<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; becomes even clearer in bigger chords:  4:5:6:7 has even stronger<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; reinforcement whereas 1/(7:6:5:4) again has scattered difference<br/>tones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hon&apos;t forget sum tones, which I believe are assumed in many models<br/>&gt; &gt; to be the same amplitude in every order as difference tones.  It<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; true that they fall in a register which makes them poor<br/>candidates as<br/>&gt; &gt; roots, and here we already are assuming something special about<br/>roots.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, yet I don&apos;t tend to hear them much, if at all.
