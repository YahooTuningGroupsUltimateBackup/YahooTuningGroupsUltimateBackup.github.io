I&apos;m pretty sure nobody is ever &gt;&gt;going to use these terms...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;J. Pehrson<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sorry, guess again.<br/>&gt; &gt; the reason why Paul and i decided to come up with a<br/>&gt; new term for this (i think we&apos;ve finally settled on<br/>&gt; &quot;vum&quot; for &quot;vanishing unison monzo&quot;) is because we got<br/>&gt; tired of typing the long 3-word version so much in<br/>&gt; our discussions.  essentially it&apos;s an acronym, but<br/>&gt; i prefer to just make it a simple word.</p><p>please be sincere and leave it as an acronym, preferably a capitalzed one that will never never be mistaken for a word.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; when something is similar to something else but the<br/>&gt; difference is an important one, it&apos;s worthwhile to<br/>&gt; distinguish the two terms with clearly separable &gt; terminology.</p><p>and by using adjectives and nouns (plain english) you can draw attention to the difference directly using the adjective only.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;s an important fact that in a temperament, not<br/>&gt; only does the &quot;typical&quot; unison-vector vanish, but<br/>&gt; so do all of its multiples and all of the reciprocals.</p><p>isn&apos;t that trivial? nought of nought is...</p><p>&gt; &gt; for example, all meantones temper out not only the<br/>&gt; syntonic-comma 81:80 but also the double-syntonic-comma,<br/>&gt; the &quot;reverse&quot; syntonic-comma, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; and because these intervals do *not* vanish in JI,</p><p>isn&apos;t that trivial?</p><p>&gt; it&apos;s clearly good to have a term which distinguishes &gt; them from their JI counterparts (which we&apos;re still<br/>&gt; calling &quot;unison-vectors&quot;: a vum is a specific type<br/>&gt; of unison-vector).</p><p>wouldn&apos;t it be good policy in communication to establish first whether you are talking about ji or temperaments?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; there are thus two important concepts embedded in &quot;vum&quot;:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1)<br/>&gt; the fact that a whole set of intervals which is<br/>&gt; linear in prime-space, is defined uniquely by a<br/>&gt; simple set of numbers (appearing as a &quot;monzo&quot;).<br/>&gt; &gt; 2)<br/>&gt; the fact that all of these intervals do physically<br/>&gt; and literally vanish.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gene started using &quot;monzo&quot; because it was much more<br/>&gt; convenient than &quot;prime-factor exponent vector&quot;.<br/>&gt; ultimately, &quot;monzo&quot; is still just another name for<br/>&gt; &quot;ratio&quot; ... but a &quot;monzo&quot; immediately conveys data<br/>&gt; which allows the mind to visualize the ratio&apos;s location<br/>&gt; in prime-space, something which is difficult with the<br/>&gt; plain rational number.<br/>&gt; &gt; can you see from this example how much easier it is<br/>&gt; to discuss &quot;monzo&quot; than &quot;prime-factor exponent vector<br/>&gt; of a ratio&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think about how convenient it is to use &quot;cents&quot;<br/>&gt; in tuning discussions.<br/>&gt; and fortunately they aren&apos;t called ellises...<br/>cent was and is a widely used prefix for divisions into 100 parts.</p><p>&gt; now, think about where we would be, if back in 1875 &gt; someone said to Ellis, &quot;we don&apos;t need a term for &gt; &quot;cents&quot; ... we can just call it &apos;logarithmic pitch-size<br/>&gt; of an interval&apos; (... and besides, we already have<br/>&gt; merides and savarts)&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it always seems like jargon when it&apos;s brand-new<br/>&gt; ... over time people will either use the term or &gt; change it to something else, but in any case, &gt; once the concept has been embodied in a word,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s not likely to go away.</p><p>my (our?
