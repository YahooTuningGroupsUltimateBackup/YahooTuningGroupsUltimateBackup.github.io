Leo de Vries has an<br/>article with pictures and diagrams of his VTSK (Variable Tone System<br/>Keyboard) microtonal keyboard, which is reconfigurable for different<br/>tunings (16 or 8 and 19-tet are illustrated). De Vries&apos;s keyboard<br/>appears to be a variation of the generalized pattern with specially<br/>shaped digitals and a novel mechanism to raise certain digitals in order<br/>mark the octaves (very useful for keeping one&apos;s bearings when changing<br/>tuning systems). He has also devised notations for various tunings which<br/>correlate with the keyboard patterns.</p><p>De Vries also mentions a &quot;Rotterdam Microtone Workshop&quot; whose members<br/>will finish the wiring and programming of the keyboard at end of<br/>February, 1999. Perhaps Manuel knows something about this group.</p><p>Unfortunately, no further details are given about the workshop and as<br/>far as I know, de Vries does not have a webpage or email. Too bad,<br/>because his keyboard needs to be seen as well as heard.</p><p>Gjalt Wijmenga also has an article in this issue. He discusses various<br/>keyboards including the von Janko, Siemen Terpstra, accordian, and<br/>Bosanquet types, but appears to limit his interest to 12-tet.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xx</h3><span>1/15/1999 4:48:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Chalmers wrote:<br/>&gt; De Vries also mentions a &quot;Rotterdam Microtone Workshop&quot; whose members<br/>&gt; will finish the wiring and programming of the keyboard at end of<br/>&gt; February, 1999.

It&apos;s ready for three quarter part now. He uses the STEIM<br/>Sensorlab module. I asked if he&apos;d mind if I gave his address and he said<br/>he&apos;d welcome any inquiries.
