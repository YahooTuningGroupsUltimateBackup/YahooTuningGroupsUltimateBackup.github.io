And I also believe that<br/>there is plenty enough elbow room in what Ives says for this to be an<br/>extremely viable artistic interpretation of what he wrote. I guess<br/>that my personal hope would be that the issue would get the real<br/>in-depth sort of a going over that it deserves (and which is probably<br/>well-nigh impossible for any one person to do), and that in the end,<br/>what can be said to be the case and what can be said to not be the<br/>case, will both get a fair shake. But maybe this is an unrealistic<br/>expectation - consider the current thread on Bach. I&apos;d have to imagine<br/>that that has been given the multiple attention of quite a few<br/>interested and knowledgeable people, and yet...</p><p>I have no axe to grind here... no particular type of a position that<br/>must be won... I&apos;m just not convinced, or perhaps willing to connect<br/>some of the same pieces of the puzzle that Johnny (apparently) is. In<br/>the same off-line correspondence Johnny wrote, &quot;There&apos;s seems for me<br/>enough circumstantial evidence backed up by the music itself that a<br/>pure Pythagorean tuning is suitable for much of Ives&apos;s music. To deny<br/>this is to lose a dimension to Ives that is both deserving and<br/>virtually unheard.&quot; I really find it all but impossible to argue with<br/>the gist of that... and I think that our main points of disagreement<br/>here seem to be turning on the semantics of how this is presented,<br/>again: what can be said to be the case, and what can be said to not be<br/>the case... there is a difference I think.</p><p>&gt;I look forward to making available a published score, studio<br/>recording, and matching book to explain all this for release in April<br/>2001.</p><p>Tonight I was reading with my five-year-old son Bryan before he went<br/>to bed, and as he was trying to sound out &quot;glove,&quot; he quickly put<br/>together the &quot;gl&quot; and the picture and told me, &quot;good readers guess.&quot; I<br/>think he&apos;s got it... In Swafford&apos;s appendix to _A LIFE WITH MUSIC_<br/>(which incidentally is completely devoted to editing Ives) he writes,<br/>&quot;Some performers&apos; decisions -- such as to include the &quot;shadow lines&quot;<br/>in the Third Symphony or to keep the Fugue in the First Quartet --<br/>will turn out dubious, but so be it. Ives&apos;s music challenges us at<br/>every turn, beginning with the notes on the page. It is the connection<br/>of all aspects of his world, from the inconclusiveness of some of his<br/>manuscripts through his political convictions to his aesthetics and<br/>metaphysics, that shows the ultimate unity in the vision of this<br/>paradoxical genius. If he overrated our abilities as collaborators,<br/>his heart was in the right place and his generosity as lavish in that<br/>as in everything else.&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=6561 href="#6561">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/3/1999 5:44:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Each time I post new material to the list relevant to Ives&apos;s tuning<br/>conception, Dan feels it necessary to defend the psychologiocal aspects of<br/>Ives&apos;s music for piano.  Yesterday, I heard a lecture by George Pappastravrou<br/>at C.W. Post on Charles Ives and that is all he spoke about.</p><p>From George P.&apos;s point of view (he&apos;s in the Ives Society and he recorded the<br/>quartertone pieces are the early CRI recording) the tuning is all<br/>pschological.  He announced regularly that the Ives &quot;wrote lots of wrong<br/>notes into his music&quot; on purpose.</p><p>Sometime I thank the fates that I am not a pianist.  If the Concord Sonata is<br/>thought of _only_ as piano music then there is no more discussion necessary.<br/>However, if Ives is taken at his word, then the idea for this composition and<br/>others is tuned differently, at least as a goal perhaps not to be reached in<br/>his lifetime.</p><p>So much was not achieved in Ives&apos;s lifetime.  He heard little of his music<br/>and was humbled by physical incapacity by the midpoint of his life.  To say<br/>that one person cannot put this material on tuning together (you might as<br/>well say one person could not finish the pieces of Ives that were defiantly<br/>unfinished by the composer) is just the dare that drives me on.  Wolfgang<br/>Rathert wrote an essay on Ives&apos;s &quot;potentiality&quot; which specifically describes<br/>Ives as distinct from all European models.  This includes the mixing of<br/>musical styles in his music, and specifically the &quot;unfinished&quot; element, along<br/>with improvisation feels in the music.</p><p>I will try to to repeat myself as I continue to put relevant material on the<br/>web.  Most important, my idea will be backed up by performances, recordings,<br/>and publications.</p><p>I&apos;m not so concerned at being sold short when I speak about controversial<br/>musical issues.  It is the rancor that it receives that bridles.  And not<br/>only from list members, but from &quot;supposed&quot; Ives specialists.  There is no<br/>one on the Ives Society that can discuss these issues, nor could Jan Swafford.</p><p>Amazingly, (here a micro-editorial) everyone continues to sell Ives short.<br/>All this discussion about the primacy of the Idea in Ives&apos;s music, and then<br/>his tuning ideas vanish from the scene.  Same with discussions of Renaissance<br/>music when I was at Columbia U.: no discussion about tuning.  Maybe it&apos;s less<br/>difficult for one person to figure out the tuning ramifications of Ives than<br/>it is for an individual to comprehend conceptually all the tuning precepts<br/>for all of music through all of time.  We have to try.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>American Festival of Alternatively-tuned Music</p></div><h3><a id=6563 href="#6563">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@capecod.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/1999 10:27:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;To say that one person cannot put this material on tuning together<br/>(you might as well say one person could not finish the pieces of Ives<br/>that were defiantly unfinished by the composer) is just the dare that<br/>drives me on.</p><p>Actually I wrote, &quot;my personal hope would be that the issue would get<br/>the real in-depth sort of a going over that it deserves (and which is<br/>probably well-nigh impossible for any one person to do).&quot; With a<br/>musical output as large and conceptually challenging as Ives, I think<br/>that there is a lot to go over, the above was just a nod in the<br/>direction of patience and thoroughness, not a challenge... Anyone<br/>could take a dare here (and some better than others no doubt), I just<br/>don&apos;t see it that way at all... and this just reflects my temperament,<br/>which is to say something like &quot;that&apos;s really interesting Johnny, lets<br/>get in there and see what can really be seen.&quot; But for someone who<br/>wants to &quot;move things forward&quot; (a good thing!), that may be nothing<br/>more than an irrelevant nuisance, or a pile of tangled busy work<br/>standing in the way of actually getting it done... So be it.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not so concerned at being sold short when I speak about<br/>controversial musical issues. It is the rancor that it receives that<br/>bridles. And not only from list members,</p><p>I don&apos;t remember too many people here discussing this so I&apos;ll take<br/>that to mean (at least in part) me... I&apos;m offering (as polite as I<br/>know how, which probably ain&apos;t always as polite as I would hope) what<br/>objections I have because I&apos;m interested, because I care, and because<br/>I believe (to a certain extent anyway) that I have some understanding<br/>or feel for the parameters of the subject as it&apos;s being discussed...<br/>but I don&apos;t see where I&apos;ve either sold you short, or expressed any ill<br/>will...</p><p>&gt;but from &quot;supposed&quot; Ives specialists.  There is no one on the Ives<br/>Society that can discuss these issues, nor could Jan Swafford.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ll take you&apos;re word for it... and if that really is the case,<br/>then I suppose that you are out there on your own in a way. Some might<br/>see that as making the job easier, and others might see it as making<br/>the job more problematic - things will turn out however they turn<br/>out... My objections have never really been about getting this music<br/>(a Pythagorean reading of Ives note spellings) out there, they have<br/>been about the way that the puzzle is pieced together... and if I<br/>really thought they were nothing but a nay-saying bother, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>really give a damn - I&apos;ve got better things to do (and if I don&apos;t - I<br/>damn well should!)</p><p>&gt;Amazingly, (here a micro-editorial) everyone continues to sell Ives<br/>short.</p><p>Hmm... I don&apos;t know about anybody else, but as you did say &quot;everyone,&quot;<br/>I can only say that I think I&apos;m personally doing anything but...</p><p>&gt;All this discussion about the primacy of the Idea in Ives&apos;s music,<br/>and then his tuning ideas vanish from the scene.</p><p>My objections (or whatever they are) have NOT been about not seeing<br/>this through... again my hope was that this would fire up a bunch of<br/>people (say the Ives Society people) and it -- the intonational<br/>implications of Charles Ives note spellings -- would get a big, loving<br/>going over... (anything but vanish).</p><p>&gt;Maybe it&apos;s less difficult for one person to figure out the tuning<br/>ramifications of Ives than it is for an individual to comprehend<br/>conceptually all the tuning precepts for all of music through all of<br/>time.</p><p>I would hope so!</p><p>&gt;We have to try.</p><p>Well I for one *do* look forward to whatever (archeological) else you<br/>might turn up while chugging through the evidence, and I especially<br/>can&apos;t wait to hear the actual (Pythagorean) performances...</p><p>Dan (the tuning punk) Stearns</p></div>
