When it entered the final &quot;chord&quot; for a Picardy<br/>&quot;major&quot; quality, it was not seen as a modulation (the way some teachers of<br/>mine had unfortunately suggested).  It is merely the emphasis of the tonic,<br/>which already has its perfect fifth.  Sometimes the 386 cent interval is only<br/>a fifth harmonic, and not a third at all.</p><p>Appreciating something by itself, unrelated to anything else, is a difficult<br/>thing to accomplish, and yet, this may be the only way to properly determine<br/>any inherent powers for a particular interval, or chord.
