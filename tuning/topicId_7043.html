Schirmer, Inc. and Associated Music Publishers<br/>WebPage, where it is presented as an &quot;arrangers note&quot;) about the<br/>Concord Symphony...</p><p>&quot;In choosing the Concord Sonata for orchestral treatment I felt, above<br/>all, that here Ives had achieved his most complete and comprehensive<br/>expression, and that of all his works, this was the one with the most<br/>immediate appeal. Henry Cowell agreed, and encouraged me to go ahead<br/>with the project... My task throughout was illuminated by Ives&apos;s own<br/>&quot;Essays Before a Sonata&quot; and his collected &quot;Memos,&quot; and in some cases<br/>Ives&apos;s words helped me decipher what at first seemed baffling in his<br/>printed music...&quot;</p><p>The last bit of this would especially seem to have some obvious<br/>similarities to a lot of what has been discussed here at the TD<br/>pertaining to Ives and the possible implications of his note<br/>spellings... I wonder what Brant&apos;s take on this was... this would seem<br/>especially relevant as an orchestration of the Concord would not<br/>neceserily be rigidly tied to the standard fixed pitch modus operandi<br/>of the piano, and there would ostensibly be a variety of ways to<br/>address instances of especially peculiar note spellings (which may be<br/>some of what Brant is referring to when he wrote &quot;what at first seemed<br/>baffling in his printed music&quot;) that wouldn&apos;t neceserily entail<br/>retuning the piano and/or the whole piece...</p><p>Dan</p></div>
