It seems to<br/>very difficult to find positive grounds for identify the interval with a 9:7,<br/>especially within a triadic context.</p><p>Perhaps we&apos;re framing the question wrong.  If, as a warm up, we were to sing<br/>the triad c-e-g, I might very well sing the &quot;e&quot; raised, in anticipation of<br/>moving to an f in a subdominant harmony. The exact interval of that raising<br/>need not be as important as the sensation of &quot;leading-toneness&quot;.  If,<br/>however, I sang that &quot;e&quot; following a dominant harmony, I would probably relax<br/>the intonation, seeking a restful conclusion on a 4:5:6 triad.</p><p>It would be interesting if Gerald could record a choral group singing the<br/>same triad three times: (1) alone, (2) before a subdominant chord, and (3)<br/>after a dominant chord.</p></div>
