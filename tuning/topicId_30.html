So far I&apos;ve just worked in 19TET, but<br/>17TET would be simple. 22TET isn&apos;t out of the question either. Equal<br/>temperments are a cinch with sliding frets, JI is out of the question. I<br/>have a web page with some (okay) photos:<br/><a href="http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~leigh/Music/microtonalGuitar.html">http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~leigh/Music/microtonalGuitar.html</a></p><p>As I mention there, I tune all strings in fourths, which works very well<br/>for 19TET as the fretting patterns are very similar and match the tuning<br/>of my Oud. The only benefit I can see from tuning to the original guitar<br/>tension is the octave equivalent 6th and 1st strings.<br/>---<br/>Leigh                 Computer Music Lab, Computer Science Dept,<br/>Smith                 University of Western Australia<br/>                      +61-8-9380-2279 <a href="mailto:leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au">leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au</a> (NeXTMail/MIME)<br/>Microsoft - What do you want to re-install today?</p></div>
