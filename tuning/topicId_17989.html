A number of years<br/>ago a musician friend of mine, knowing of my interest in overtone singing,<br/>bought me a copy of your first tape as a gift. I just about wore it out. I&apos;m<br/>quite glad to see that you have some CDs available now, I&apos;ll peruse your<br/>site again later when the &apos;net isn&apos;t so congested and order one.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>&quot;Music is far, far older than our species. It is tens of millions of years<br/>old, and the fact that animals as wildly divergent as whales, humans and<br/>birds come out with similar laws for what they compose suggests to me that<br/>there are a finite number of musical sounds that will entertain the<br/>vertebrate brain.&quot;</p><p>              Roger Payne, president of Ocean Alliance, quoted in NY Times</p></div>
