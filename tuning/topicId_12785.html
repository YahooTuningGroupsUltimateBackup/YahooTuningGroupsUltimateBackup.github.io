Was he on the Tuning List?? [JP]</p><p>Date: September 13, 2000 04:38 PM<br/>    Author: Adam B. Silverman (<a href="mailto:adam@minimumsecurity.org">adam@minimumsecurity.org</a>)<br/>    Subject: microtonal plusses and minuses</p><p>I haven&apos;t chimed in about microtonality for quite a while now, but I<br/>used to have avery strong interest in composing microtonal Just<br/>intonation music, and was a avid correspondent on the online tuning<br/>list.</p><p>    I composed several pieces in just-tunings, and found my<br/>microtonal education to be an excellent way to put together my<br/>thoughts on an aspect of music that many people don&apos;t know exists.<br/>Some of my pieces<br/>used instruments with fixed tunings (electric guitars, keyboards and<br/>electronic instruments), and these were performed very well. Those<br/>that I wrote for flexibly-tuned instruments were performed less well,<br/>and I found that they gained no more rehearsal time for their<br/>microtonal intricacies; the time that would ordinarily be spent on<br/>expression was given over to tuning. This generally resulted in dull,<br/>uninformed performances with dubiously accurate tunings.</p><p>    I also found that, in discussing my music, I became primarily a<br/>teacher of tuning concepts. The other important musical features of<br/>style, structure, melody, and texture seemed to be of no interest<br/>when alternative tunings entered the picture. I found this to be a<br/>form of elitism, and found the gap between composer and performer to<br/>be greatly increased as a result.</p><p>    In composing music that uses vanilla tuning, I have found much<br/>greater rewards in my relationships with performers and also with<br/>audiences. This is probably because we gain a closer comaraderie by<br/>&quot;speaking the same language.&quot; This summer, I spent quite a lot of<br/>time with people who were performing a microtonal piece by Tristan<br/>Murail- a piece in a &quot;spectral&quot; style that was foreign to everyone in<br/>the ensemble. The stylistic aspects were no problem for these<br/>capable performers; the quartertone runs, however, caused much grief<br/>and soured the piece for many of the players. In the end, the<br/>performance sounded quite good, but the overall experience of the<br/>performers was not a positive one.</p><p>    For those who perform their own music, alone or with a<br/>self-directed ensemble, they certainly could create a situation in<br/>which everyone involved would be thrilled by the process. I don&apos;t see<br/>many people doing this with great result, but certainly this was a<br/>great outlet for composers like La Monte Young and Lou Harrison,<br/>who both additionally dealt with bringing foreign cultural<br/>experiences into Western music.</p><p>    What I&apos;m trying to do is fairly express that I found most<br/>microtonalists to be frustrated with their musical relationships and<br/>experiences. Some of them endure this with a great zeal for the<br/>microtonal &quot;cause,&quot; and others seem to hide behind the technical<br/>aspects of microtonality to disguise a lack of inspiration.<br/>Perhaps others simply thrive on adversity.</p><p>    So I find microtonalism in Western classical music to be a sort<br/>of a cult which has, granted, been a source of inspiration for a few<br/>great musicians. But overall, I have decided to place my energies<br/>elsewhere.</p><p>At least for now.</p><p>***********[At least &quot;for now??  What does that mean, buddy...<br/>equivocation if I ever heard of it...] [JP]</p><p>**********Kyle Gann, &quot;Mr Custer&quot; to the rescue: [JP]</p><p>Date: September 14, 2000 04:15 AM<br/>        Author: Kyle Gann (<a href="mailto:kgann@earthlink.net">kgann@earthlink.net</a>)<br/>        Subject: Hiding behind the math</p><p>        Gee, Adam, I appreciate your honesty, and it&apos;s true that a<br/>lot of microtonal composers seem to hide behind the math, and be more<br/>interested in demonstrating the theory than in making expressive<br/>music. But that doesn&apos;t mean that there aren&apos;t a number of strategies<br/>for achieving beautiful, expressive microtonal music. In fact, I<br/>quite enjoyed your just-intonation string quartet at the last AFMM<br/>microthon, as I&apos;m enjoying the Dan Stearns pieces I&apos;m hearing, which<br/>are anything but dry. For years I&apos;ve been making music with<br/>synthesizers that presents no additional performance difficulty at<br/>all, and in fact the performers love the feel of playing the familiar<br/>keys and getting an array of totally unfamiliar pitches. A compliment<br/>that I&apos;ve gotten several times that I greatly treasure is that, in my<br/>music, you can hear the expressive effect of the microtonal chords,<br/>and that the pitches make memorable melodic sense.</p><p>        It is a question I&apos;d like to see others address: why does so<br/>much microtonal music seem like a mere expression of theory, with no<br/>memorable expressive value. But I don&apos;t see it in any way as a<br/>condemnation of microtonality in general, which has existed as a<br/>potential for thousands of years for anyone willing to use its<br/>resources. Microtones do form a tremendous barrier in a conventional<br/>performance situation, but why settle for a conventional performance<br/>situation? I steer clear of those situations for precisely the reason<br/>that, when I write equal temperament music, I feel like I&apos;m<br/>using chords 5000 other composers have already used to death, and I&apos;m<br/>constantly struggling with associations they created; but when I<br/>write in just intonation, I feel like I&apos;m all alone on a new planet,<br/>and it&apos;s so much easier to be inspired and spontaneous. Lately I&apos;ve<br/>gotten several requests from performers for 12-ET music, and I&apos;m<br/>gratifying them, but I can&apos;t wait to get back from the crowded<br/>metropolis of 12 tones to the wild, free woods of just intonation.</p><p>********Jeff Harrington has his &quot;say&quot; [JP]</p><p>Date: September 14, 2000 07:58 AM<br/>            Author: Jeff Harrington (<a href="mailto:jeff@parnasse.com">jeff@parnasse.com</a>)<br/>            Subject: Microtonalism in the Real World</p><p>            A few comments:</p><p>            1. Just intonation pieces, I just don&apos;t get them.<br/>Especially with winds and string players. They&apos;re already playing<br/>just (or something nearby)! Now they have an additional burden of<br/>tuning &quot;as I say&quot; and so their performance is going to suck.</p><p>            2. Microtonal music as an expression of theory is the<br/>reigning microtonal musical raison d&apos;etre. Why? It&apos;s like programming<br/>in C++. You only attract the geeks because it&apos;s a pain in the butt<br/>and the rewards are limited. Guess what! Here in the 21st century<br/>we&apos;ve found a new and unique way to piss audiences off!!!! :) Bad<br/>performances plus never heard before dissonances! :P</p><p>            You want to attract the cool musicians to write<br/>microtonal music? Well, if they want a live performance, you&apos;ve got a<br/>ton ofwork with the possibility of a crappy performance at best. If<br/>you have a studio recording you&apos;ve got the certainty of expensive<br/>recording session. So you&apos;re stuck doing pure electronic music. Not<br/>many guys can take a completely new paradigm to musicianship and<br/>create something great with the already problematic electronic<br/>systems<br/>(dull performances due to sequencing and loss of articulative info,<br/>limited dynamic expressiveness and dull tempi due to metronomic<br/>systems).</p><p>            So here we are! Brave new world, but timidity, and<br/>geekery abound. It&apos;s pretty obvious the blood for much of the<br/>interesting new music of the next 100 years is going to come from the<br/>marrow of new tuning systems.</p><p>            Now my question! Has anybody got that Sethares book&apos;s<br/>software to work? Has anyone hear any interest in irrational tunings?<br/>Irrational tunings for specific timbres is fascinating to me right<br/>now. (I&apos;m working on another piece like my Jardin des Merveilles with<br/>bell FM sounds using an irrational tuning system I got from his<br/>book).</p><p>            jeff - <a href="http://www.parnasse.com/jeff.htm">http://www.parnasse.com/jeff.htm</a> -<br/>            <a href="http://www.mp3.com/Jeff_Harrington">http://www.mp3.com/Jeff_Harrington</a></p><p>********Gann comes &quot;gunnin&apos;&quot; again: [JP]</p><p>Date: September 14, 2000 09:57 AM<br/>                Author: Kyle Gann (<a href="mailto:kgann@earthlink.net">kgann@earthlink.net</a>)<br/>                Subject: Plenty of well-performed JI music</p><p>        Well, I don&apos;t know what just-intonation pieces you&apos;re<br/>listening to. I listen to Young&apos;s Well-Tuned Piano, Ben Johnston&apos;s<br/>Suite for Microtonal Piano, his Quartet No. 4 in the old Fine Arts<br/>Quartet recording, Harry Partch&apos;s music with his own ensemble,<br/>Lou Harrison&apos;s gamelan music, and my own electronic music, and it&apos;s<br/>all perfectly in tune and the performances are excellent. In fact,<br/>I&apos;ve heard a lot more good performances of just-intonation music than<br/>I have bad, and I feel just as likely to hear bad performances of<br/>ET music.</p><p>        And once you attune your ears to what just intonation can do,<br/>and hear the sonic world come into focus, you start realizing that<br/>what most performers play is *not* anywhere near just intonation.<br/>I&apos;ve tasted papaya fresh off the tree in Mexico, and I&apos;ve eaten<br/>papaya<br/>out of a jar in New York, and they&apos;re two different fruits: just like<br/>a pure 5/4 major third is a different and far less vivid interval<br/>than<br/>an ET *almost* major third. But you don&apos;t know the difference until<br/>you&apos;ve sensitized yourself to it. And that&apos;s what I object to most,<br/>the fact that musicians are expected to be content with having<br/>systematically desensitized themselves to harmony.</p><p>*******Harrington, again, being a little &quot;controversial...&quot; [JP]</p><p>Date: September 14, 2000 11:32 AM<br/>                    Author: Jeff Harrington (<a href="mailto:jeff@parnasse.com">jeff@parnasse.com</a>)<br/>                    Subject: Unjustly accused!</p><p>Ha... my comment was on classical musicians in general. Classical<br/>music when it&apos;s played without even tempered instruments is<br/>auto-just-tuned typically by musicians. When you hear a Beethoven<br/>String Quartet it&apos;s just-tuned! Good musicians re-tune constantly and<br/>it&apos;s only when there&apos;s a piano involved that things get out of wack.</p><p>Good just-tuning is common in the real classical world. It&apos;s uncommon<br/>in the microtonal world! :) (JOKE)</p><p>      Just for the record... I&apos;m not a fanatic about just-tuning. I<br/>don&apos;t buy the hype. I don&apos;t even enjoy most of the just-tuning<br/>piece I&apos;ve heard.

I have an<br/>experiment I do with music students, including at conservatories: I<br/>play a droneon G and ask them to sing a purely in-tune, beatless B.<br/>In<br/>every case, I have invariably gotten a pure, ET, 400-cent B. When I<br/>gradually lead them down 14 cents to the 5/4 B, they are surprised to<br/>learn there&apos;s a pitch &quot;notch&quot; there. How can they play in just<br/>intonation if they&apos;ve never heard the interval in their lives? The<br/>complaint that the piano has ruined the intonation of singers and<br/>string players has been around for the entire century. I know a<br/>choral<br/>conductor in CA, Jeffrey Bernstein, who tunes his choir low on major<br/>thirds at cadences, but I&apos;ve never seen anyone else do it. And there<br/>might be an exceptional string quartet here and there, but the belief<br/>that classical performers gravitate toward just intonation hasn&apos;t been<br/>true in my lifetime.
