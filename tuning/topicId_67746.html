Aside<br/>from the 46 and 34 range of tunings we&apos;ve been discussing, there is<br/>another interesing range, with fifths 1-1.5 cents sharp, into which<br/>29/58/87 and 99 fall.</p><p>99-et is a superb 7-limit system, but for higher limits choices must be<br/>made as to the mapping if the plan is to use it consistently. In the 11<br/>limit, you can take the 11/8 flat (patent val) or sharp. Taking it flat<br/>gives the comma basis [121/120, 176/175, 1375/1372, 2200/2187], and<br/>using the first three commas gives the 31&amp;68 version of 11-limit<br/>hemiwuer. But we are interested in low complexity fifths temperaments,<br/>and for that, we want to take the sharp version of 11/8. This gives a<br/>comma basis of [243/242, 441/440, 896/891, 3136/3125], where now taking<br/>the first three commas leads to the 41&amp;58 version of 11-limit<br/>hemififths, and for this, 99 is a poptimal tuning.</p><p>In the 13-limit, the sharp tuning version for 99 gives commas<br/>[144/143, 196/195, 243/242, 364/363, 625/624], and the first four<br/>commas again give 41&amp;58 hemififths. Now 58 is poptimal, which starts to<br/>inch the tuning up towards the range which makes George happy.</p><p>Hemififths, with its complex 5&apos;s, makes for a good no-fives system, and<br/>the 17 and 24 note MOS make for good scales using that system. I&apos;d<br/>suggest George and Margo might like playing with Hemififths[17] and<br/>Hemififths[24] in the 58-et or even 99-et tuning. The fifth isn&apos;t quite<br/>as sharp, but the exotic harmony is certainly there. Nothing like a few<br/>8:11:14 chords to liven things up.</p></div>
