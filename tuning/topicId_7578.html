I thought I<br/> would list some of The New York Times definitions of &quot;microtonal&quot; and it is<br/> the one that I share.  (Please refrain from all knee-jerk NYC bashing, thank<br/> you.)<br/> ...<br/>(snip)<br/> ...<br/> American Festival of Microtonal Music<br/> (since 1981)<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Unfortunately, I think this is another case of folks from New York City<br/>stepping in and redefining everything on their own terms as if the rest of<br/>the universe did not exist. When the choice is between a traditional<br/>definition that means something and a new usage that means anything at all<br/>(and thus, unltimately, nothing at all), I&apos;ll stay with the tradition.</p><p>(Like Partch, I admit that I&apos;ve been happy to have largely avoided NYC,<br/>sharing Reyner Banham&apos;s viewpoint that, culturally, it&apos;s not really part of<br/>the American continent, just another island off the coast of Europe like<br/>Britain or Ireland).</p><p>To what extent Mr. Reinhard&apos;s concerts ought to be called &quot;American&quot;,<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot;, or even a &quot;festival&quot; is open to debate.  I know no one in the<br/>alternative tuning community outside of NYC who would be arrogant enough to<br/>claim a comprehensive, representative title like &quot;American&quot;; Mr. Reinhard&apos;s<br/>allo-encompassing definition of &quot;microtonal&quot; renders it superfluous as an<br/>adjective; and the enterprise lacks the seasonal structure of festivals<br/>elsewhere.  He&apos;s certainly free to call his programs whatever he wishes, but<br/>insistance on a particular label doesn&apos;t make it any more convincing.</p></div>
