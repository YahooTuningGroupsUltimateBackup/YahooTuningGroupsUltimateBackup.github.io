Thank you --Jon</p><p>Yes, I have the same problem here with a quick install, and it doesn&apos;t work like you say because the environment variable isn&apos;t set.  They promised us the installation was going to sort that out when version 5 was in development.  You can run it from the command line to see the errors.</p><p>Once you have Csound installed properly, it Just Works.
