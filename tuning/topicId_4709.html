With me is his new book &quot;Separating<br/>Earth and Sky&quot; which deals with pre-socratic philosophy.</p><p>Anaximander of Miletus (historically found south of Lydia) is usually<br/>credited with being the first great philosopher with a book.  Though only 1<br/>line remains extant, there is much commentary through Plato and Aristotle<br/>about what Anaximander intended.  As Siem explains it, Anaximander wrote to<br/>reconcile the different tunings of the known universe.  His book was calle<br/>&quot;To Apeiron&quot; or &quot;The Boundless.&quot;</p><p>The known line speaks of the judicial system as based on the justice of the<br/>interval, with increasing penalties based on the infraction.  There is much<br/>more for me to read.  However, it does seem that &quot;musical intelligence&quot; was<br/>at its apex during this period.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
