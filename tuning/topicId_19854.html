Of course, I&apos;d be delighted to<br/>share my own approach and some text files with the settings for some<br/>tunings -- but the computer-based approach is likely your best<br/>option.</p><p>My own approach is to use two standard 12-note manuals (four octave<br/>each), mapped either to identically tuned &quot;instruments&quot; (like a usual<br/>two-manual keyboard instrument), or mapped to instruments differing in<br/>their tuning sets (e.g. Ab-C# meantone on one keyboard, Eb-G# on the<br/>other) for anything from 13 to 24 notes per octave. As Ibo Ortgies<br/>might not mind me adding, this is _not_ the same thing as a real<br/>split-key instrument, but it does provide the same tuning sets of up<br/>to 24 notes.</p><p>Please let me caution that the four-octave range is great for medieval<br/>and Renaissance music, typically more than ample, but that larger<br/>keyboards are standard for later music, so the usual norm of five<br/>octaves or more may be a rule proved by my exception, so to speak.</p><p>By the way, some of my favorite voices are A22 (&quot;oboe,&quot; which I<br/>consider a kind of &quot;crumhorn&quot; or &quot;regal organ&quot;); A44 and A45<br/>(&quot;harpsichord&quot; timbres that neatly contrast and combine); and A56<br/>(&quot;puff pipes&quot; -- could this be some kind of small organ). This last<br/>can be &quot;Sethareanistically friendly&quot; to tunings with more complex<br/>intervals which one wants to give a certain &quot;kinder and gentler&quot;<br/>quality -- but it&apos;s also great for something like Renaissance<br/>meantone.</p><p>Anyway, please enjoy -- and there&apos;s lot of TX-802 expertise around<br/>here that I&apos;ve benefitted from a great deal.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2001 10:57:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;M.
