Is this the Piano Technician&apos;s Guild we are referring to?  If<br/>so,  I would like to say that the &quot;Guildness&quot; of a technician is not a factor<br/>in what is tuned.  I would certainly hope that the choice of temperament<br/>would be the resulting harmonic balance of the music.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html">http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html</a></p></div>
