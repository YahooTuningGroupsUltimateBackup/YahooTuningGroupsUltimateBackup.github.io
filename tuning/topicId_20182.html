As it&apos;s 11-limit<br/>consistent, altering the third or seventh of a chord will usually give<br/>interesting results.  And that&apos;s on top the chords being cleanly tuned<br/>to start with.

Violinists in particular seem to be<br/>wedded to Pythagorean thinking.  So it&apos;s interesting to hear them<br/>explicitly mentioned as hanging the other way before.  A real sea<br/>change must have taken place.  Also that they were encouraged to tune<br/>to keyboards, so the strings would have been in meantone rather than<br/>Pythagorean fifths.
