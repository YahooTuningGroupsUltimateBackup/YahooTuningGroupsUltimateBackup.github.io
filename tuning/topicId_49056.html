I&apos;ll fix it - yes makes sense. That one is Cjms6<br/>So they are Cjms6 (same as Cu6m6), Csmj6 (same as Co6m6)<br/>and Co5m6</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, looking at your paper, I have had a few preliminary ideas<br/>&gt; about how<br/>&gt; &gt; to add in the decatonic chords notation for 22 equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for taking the time to look at it! And if you get a chance,<br/>&gt; try making up some chord progressions; you can pretty drag four<br/>&gt; sticks fractally through the decatonic sand and come up with nice<br/>&gt; harmonies.</p><p>Rightio. Maybe it would be good for a fractal tune or so I<br/>wonder... Haven&apos;t explored them in 22-eq yet.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Idea is to allow the user to set a major mode, e.g.<br/>&gt; &gt; Standard Pentachordal Major:<br/>&gt; &gt; 0 2 4 7 9 11 13 16 18 20 (22)<br/>&gt; &gt; and a minor mode, e.g.<br/>&gt; &gt; Standard Pentachordal Minor:<br/>&gt; &gt; 0 2 4 6 9 11 13 15 17 19 (22)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But not really sure how to use those in the notation.<br/>&gt; &gt; - sketched out a few ideas but they aren&apos;t entirely<br/>&gt; &gt; satisfactory.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ie. how to interpret, e.g. I9 and i9 (9 here = &quot;seventh&quot; of 12 eq)<br/>&gt; &gt; when one wants to make a distinction between major and minor<br/>&gt; depending on the<br/>&gt; &gt; numeral as upper or lower.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the letter &quot;I&quot; here? Is it a Roman numeral? If so, you<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t even have the 9 on the symbol, if the chord you mean is 0-7-<br/>&gt; 13-18 in 22-equal.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I saw in the paper that you used I for the 0-7-13-18, but I<br/>suppose I didn&apos;t understand why that was, because in<br/>12-t &quot;I&quot; stands for the major triad without the seventh doesn&apos;t<br/>it? So why does it have an added seventh in 22-eq?<br/>How do you notate the triad without the seventh if you<br/>use I for the seventh (ninth)?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Do you have any thoughts about what I9 and i9 should<br/>&gt; &gt; be as scale degrees,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm . . . I&apos;m not sure why you would want to use the symbol 9. I<br/>&gt; guess the &apos;default&apos; is 1-4-7-9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and ditto for the other upper and lower case<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols in the Roman numeral notation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m visiting this point in your message from the future. Capital<br/>&gt; means major tetrad, lower case means minor tetrad, just like they<br/>&gt; mean major triad and minor triad in diatonic music, where the<br/>&gt; diminished triad is viio or iio and augmented is III+, so you could<br/>&gt; use + for augmented decatonic tetrads too.</p><p>Ah, I didn&apos;t know about the o for diminished. I&apos;ll add that in<br/>- will need to do something to prevent confusion with the new<br/>&apos;o&apos; for otonal.</p><p>Seems that if you leave out the o then vii is understood as<br/>meaning viio as it is used like that e.g. here.<br/><a href="http://www.tonalityguide.com/xxnondom4.php">http://www.tonalityguide.com/xxnondom4.php</a><br/>Can vii ever mean vii with a perfect fifth BTW? Or if you want<br/>to  notate that, do you do viiaug5 or something? Maybe<br/>it is just never used...</p><p>Rightio, seems that the default in your decatonic notation is to use<br/>roman numerals for tetrads. But why is that? Maybe I need<br/>a check box somewhere so user can choose whether to<br/>have the sevenths included in the roman numerals chord symbol.<br/>Or something.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (and<br/>&gt; &gt; their flats and sharps and augmented and diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; chords)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should work out alright . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thing is that in 12 eq of course the I7 is always 7b<br/>&gt; &gt; to make it a dominant seventh of the subdominant.<br/>&gt; &gt; But what should one do here? I suppose rotate the<br/>&gt; &gt; scale around so the 9 is 18. But what about e.g. I9sus2<br/>&gt; &gt; - should the 2 there be chromatically altered too?<br/>&gt; &gt; - I mean as 0 3 isntead of 0 2. Perhaps?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would a sus2 arise in the decatonic system? It wouldn&apos;t seem to,<br/>&gt; but . . . I&apos;m afraid we may have to take this more slowly.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well or a sus3, or an add3 (which would be 5 instead of 4<br/>in the subdominant tuning). Not with any particular<br/>harmonisation in mind, just that when you design a notation<br/>system for a program, you have to assume user might<br/>enter anything that is legal in the notation, and<br/>sus2 or sus3 would surely have to be legal. So<br/>then one needs to know how they should be tuned.<br/>Then if the add2 or add3 occurs in the context of<br/>a dominant seventh, does that mean that you think<br/>of it as tuned to the subdominant at that point??<br/>What if they occur outside that context. I know<br/>it is kind of nit picking but if you are programming it<br/>then you have to sort all this out, or at least think<br/>about it and make some kind of reasonable default.</p><p>&gt; &gt; First thought anyway is:<br/>&gt; &gt; I9 = 1 4 7 9 (11) tuned to the subdominant key = 0 7 13 18<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d just call it I, not I9.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Im9 = 1 4 7 9 (11) in the minor mode = 0 6 13 17 (22)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; where I suppose the m and M symbols should be thought of as<br/>&gt; &gt; affecting the entire chord - immediately after the note name<br/>&gt; &gt; the effect goes forwards and backwards and if used later in<br/>&gt; &gt; the chord then it goes forwards only to affect notes that follow.<br/>&gt; &gt; So the seventh in  Im9 is 17 and in I9 is 18.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So ImM9 = 0 6 13 18 (22)<br/>&gt; &gt; and IMm9 = 0 7 13 17 (22)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those chords are defined in my paper, so again, you can drop the 9<br/>&gt; from the designation.</p><p>Can do. Could do them also as iM and Im in the mixed notation chord<br/>then you need to do the triads as i(9) I suppose and I(9) where<br/>you don&apos;t need  to specify the m or M as it is to be omitted<br/>anyway. It is quite neat if you want to use mainly tetrads.<br/>But if your chord progression has many triads then all those<br/>(9)s would get clumsy. Maybe that is it as I expect you probably<br/>use lots of seventh chords when you play in this system,<br/>and relatively few plain triads.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And Isus2 possibly as tuned to the subdominant too<br/>&gt; &gt; = 1 2 4 7 9 (11) = 0 3 7 13 18 (22)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I&apos;m really confused. Diatonically speaking, Isus2 and Isus4<br/>&gt; chords have the same number of notes as I chords. And why would<br/>&gt; you &quot;tune to the subdominant&quot;?</p><p>Sorry, did a Iadd2 there.</p><p>Thing is that in 12-t the seventh on the root of a chord<br/>is played as a b, e.g. Bb for the I7 in C major, so it is tuned<br/>to the key of the subdominant of the root of the chord, so<br/>it seems. I think of it that way because it would often<br/>be used in the progression I7 IV, and of course originally<br/>V7 I where the V7 there is tuned to the major scale for the<br/>I chord.</p><p>Only got the one note that differs in tuning between the<br/>tonic and the subdominant in 12-t. and that is the one<br/>used for the seventh in thedominant seventh. I suppose you could<br/>think of it instead as the minor seventh, but why<br/>should one think of it that way for a piece in the<br/>major key, rather than as a note from the subdominant key?<br/>Or is there some other interpretation? Quite possibly<br/>I&apos;m way off track, don&apos;t hesitate to say if I am!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can do I and i for major and minor and the sequence<br/>&gt; &gt; of triads in the Pentachordal Major is then<br/>&gt; &gt; I II III iv V VI VII viii ix x (XI)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should be tetrads,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I II+ III+ iv VMm VI VII viii ix xmM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and then for the dominant &quot;seventh&quot; (i.e. ninth) chords it is<br/>&gt; &gt; I9 II9aug7  III9aug7 iv9 Vm9 VI9 VII9 viii9 ix9 xM9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See above. If you want no 9 you can use the no9 symbol.</p><p>Rightio, can do. As III(9) perhaps? That&apos;s how I do it<br/>at present in the chord progression player. But why<br/>- and is this something special about the decatonic<br/>system if it is based on tetrads rather than triads<br/>in the roman numeral notation, and if so when generalising<br/>12-t to any number of notes per octave how do you decide<br/>which tunings are tetrad based and which are triads<br/>based?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But that is a bit hard to remember. So would do<br/>&gt; &gt; a &quot;keep to mode&quot; option and perhaps use an &apos;%&apos; for that,<br/>&gt; &gt; so in 12-eq %I is I and %II is ii etc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; nice</p><p>Great. Glad you like it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so here with this example, %II9 will mean II9aug7 and %V9 will mean<br/>&gt; Vm9 etc<br/>&gt; &gt; which will save the newbie user from the need to remember<br/>&gt; &gt; which chords are which, and indeed be easier to type for everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, as you can in the table on page 11 on my paper, this is the way<br/>&gt; I did it, though I used I II III IV V VI VIII IX and X to mean the<br/>&gt; tetrads occuring as 1-4-7-9, in each of the eight given modes.</p><p>Yes I know. The thing is that I am thinking of it as a generalisation<br/>from the 12-t system that will work with any number of notes per<br/>octave.</p><p>I do also have an option to define symbols particularly for<br/>particular tunings that don&apos;t need to fit into that pattern,<br/>which I will work on and it could be done that way</p><p>Indeed they could be done like that already in the player - just<br/>set the scale to 22-eq and define each roman numeral<br/>individually in the Extra Symbols list as a tetrad<br/>with the appropriate list of degrees.</p><p>But that is less flexible. You can&apos;t make up new symbols<br/>for instance and immediately use them - you have to<br/>add each symbol you want to the list of extra  symbols<br/>complete with degrees etc before you can use it.<br/>Also currently the extra symbols only define a pattern<br/>of degrees so if you change to another scale with<br/>a different number of notes to anoctave say, then all<br/>your notes will shift about. This extra symbols section<br/>is something I will work on later.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, if the tricky issues can get sorted out, this general idea<br/>&gt; &gt; is immediately generalisable to scales with any number<br/>&gt; &gt; of notes - you just need to set a &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; mode and you<br/>&gt; can then<br/>&gt; &gt; immediately use the notation,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or maybe eight modes! :)</p><p>Ah the thing there is that yes you can have any number of modes<br/>for the keyboard mapping, and easily switch between them.<br/>But this is not yet integrated into the chord progression view - you<br/>would have to change back and forth between that and the<br/>retuning keyboard views - or else show an Arpeggio Window<br/>and do it there. Anyway I&apos;ll deal with that.</p><p>At present the chord progression player doesn&apos;t take<br/>account of the modes at all, but it should, I now realise.<br/>It is just playing major chord progressions at present<br/>I suppose. User should be able to set the mode to<br/>minor or anything else, and then it should<br/>move the chord up or down to the nearest note in the<br/>mode. For minor should use it in the melodic minor form<br/>with separate ascending and descending modes,<br/>and VI and VII then refer to the major triads on the descending<br/>mode, and vio and viio to the minor triads on the ascending<br/>mode. Or, I suppose the generalisation there is to<br/>look for a match for the chord in both the ascending and<br/>descending modes, and choose the root of the chord in<br/>one or the other depending on which gives the best match.</p><p>HOwever - that is for the tuning of the root. Interpretation<br/>of the chord symbol is another matter - which intervals<br/>to use between the successive notes in the chord.</p><p>To do that it needs a major mode in order to know how to<br/>interpret the upper case roman numerals, and a minor mode to interpret<br/>the lowercase roman numerals. Which _doesn&apos;t_ have to be<br/>the same as the mode you are currently playing in.</p><p>So you could play in any mode, invent one too,<br/>but still I or i would refer to chords tuned<br/>to the reference major and minor modes that you have<br/>set up for the chord symbols, with the root<br/>tuned to the current mode, so e.g. III will be<br/>a major triad (or tetrad) on the third degree<br/>of the current mode whatever it is.</p><p>I think that is prob. how it has to be done.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; leaving the user free to do something<br/>&gt; &gt; totally unconventional there too if they so wish, no restriction on<br/>&gt; &gt; what has to count as major or minor modes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, that is the first thought that springs to mind for this.<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cool stuff! You can try to, ultimately, support all the notations<br/>&gt; SCALA supports . . .</p><p>Yes, that is planned in fact. I&apos;ve been discussing it with<br/>Manuel. No way am I going to  be able to code all that,<br/>as it would be an immense duplication of programming<br/>effort. But, who knows, maybe somehow I will be able<br/>to call SCALA to get it to do the translations, running invisibly.<br/>It seems that it can be done technically in piped mode, but there is a<br/>question about whether the programs will be able to communicate through the<br/>pipe quickly enough if FTS needs to know how to interpret<br/>many note names in short succession. Will just have to try and see.</p><p>Probably FTS will keep a database of the users most recent note<br/>name queries, maybe the most recent 1000 queries or some such,<br/>and only ask SCALA about names that haven&apos;t been requested for<br/>some time, come to think of it, so that<br/>will probably be fast enough in nearly all situations.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One would also need a way of showing that the entire chord<br/>&gt; progression is<br/>&gt; &gt; to be interpreted in 22 equal<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or any such &apos;decatonic&apos; tuning . . .</p><p>Yes that will be understood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; because that affects how all the<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers are interpreted in the chords, e.g. 9 instead of 7 for<br/>&gt; the &quot;seventh&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; of twelve equal,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or any diatonic tuning, presumably . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and there maybe just prefix<br/>&gt; &gt; the start of the progression with &quot;eq22&quot; to do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, you would eventually be able to notate other scales that 22-<br/>&gt; equal supports (including, for example, &apos;Pythagorean/septimal&apos;<br/>&gt; diatonic scales I mention in my paper that go 4 1 4 4 1 4 4 for the<br/>&gt; minor mode, etc), so it&apos;s really not 22-equal that needs to be<br/>&gt; specified . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>The idea there is that the chord symbol gives the desired exact pitch<br/>which if the notation used was 22-eq would be 22-eq. But then if user<br/>is playing in a just 22 tone scale, each pitch in the chord gets<br/>played as the nearest pitch in the current scale. Main thing there<br/>I suppose is to say what the effect is of a b and # and + and -<br/>etc in the notation system. That is something I&apos;ll go into<br/>more in later programming, but at present you can already<br/>use the 19, 31 and 72-et accidentals in the chord symbols<br/>- for the name for the root. Can&apos;t yet use them for the modifiers<br/>of the chord but no reason why not use them there too.</p><p>Will have to think it over.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This  gives the flexibility to use this notation even with scales<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; aren&apos;t themselves 22 equal, e.g. j.i. 22 tone scales or ones<br/>&gt; &gt; with more or less notes because the chord symbols would actually<br/>&gt; pick<br/>&gt; &gt; out exact pitches in 22eq, then use closest to those in the<br/>&gt; currently<br/>&gt; &gt; selected scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just as conventional notation really only works out in meantone<br/>&gt; scales (without getting unexpected &quot;wolves&quot; and the like), decatonic<br/>&gt; notation would work out only in certain tuning systems.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes of course. That is up to user, needs to use it in an<br/>appropriate system</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll think it over a bit before doing it as it is the sort of thing<br/>&gt; &gt; where you can probably find a neat way of doing it that makes the<br/>&gt; &gt; coding much easier. Amount of code needed is probably rather modest,<br/>&gt; &gt; only a few dozen or maybe at most a couple of hundred lines of so.<br/>&gt; &gt; But it is a matter of deciding what one wants to achieve with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hopefully the above is a start. I&apos;d love to go further!</p><p>Yes, thanks, it&apos;s brought up a number of issues already and it is a<br/>great help. I will be interested to find out what you make of this<br/>too.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2003 3:11:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I saw in the paper that you used I for the 0-7-13-18, but I<br/>&gt; suppose I didn&apos;t understand why that was, because in<br/>&gt; 12-t</p><p>Well, it&apos;s not really 12-t we&apos;re talking about, it&apos;s Western<br/>tonal/modal harmonic analysis so it applies equally well to all<br/>meantones.</p><p>&gt; &quot;I&quot; stands for the major triad without the seventh doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; it?</p><p>Right, where the major triad is 1-3-5.</p><p>&gt; So why does it have an added seventh in 22-eq?</p><p>Not really 22-eq . . . but anyway it&apos;s a whole different system,<br/>where the tetrads are the basic consonances.

Or if you want<br/>&gt; to  notate that, do you do viiaug5</p><p>You wouldn&apos;t, but there are actually two conflicing conventional<br/>methods of roman numeral analysis -- the &apos;popular&apos; and<br/>the &apos;classical&apos;. You&apos;re actually mixing the two, in that roman<br/>numerals are usually &apos;classical&apos;, but the rest of your symbols<br/>aren&apos;t. In classical terminology, I7 in the key of C major is C-E-G-<br/>B, it&apos;s not C-E-G-Bb. And so on. So classically, you&apos;d say vii#5 or<br/>viix5 or viiN5 (with a natural sign instead of the letter &quot;N&quot;),<br/>depending on the key, if you wanted vii with a perfect fifth. In<br/>popular terminology, roman numerals are not used, but in the key of C<br/>major, this chord would simply be called Bm.</p><p>&gt; you have to assume user might<br/>&gt; enter anything that is legal in the notation, and<br/>&gt; sus2 or sus3 would surely have to be legal.</p><p>Why? For example, there&apos;s no such think as sus7 in diatonic<br/>terminology, is there?</p><p>Furthermore, I don&apos;t see where relating sus chords to the subdominant<br/>comes from.</p><p>&gt; Can do. Could do them also as iM and Im in the mixed notation chord</p><p>Clever.</p><p>&gt; then you need to do the triads as i(9)</p><p>I still think &quot;no9&quot; is better, since in standard &apos;popular&apos;<br/>terminology you see &quot;no3&quot; and &quot;no5&quot; used</p><p>&gt; Maybe that is it as I expect you probably<br/>&gt; use lots of seventh chords when you play in this system,<br/>&gt; and relatively few plain triads.</p><p>Yes. With tetrads, you can &apos;project&apos; all the notes of the scale more<br/>easily with just a few of them. With triads, it gets harder to keep<br/>the whole scale together in the listener&apos;s mind.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; And Isus2 possibly as tuned to the subdominant too<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; = 1 2 4 7 9 (11) = 0 3 7 13 18 (22)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now I&apos;m really confused. Diatonically speaking, Isus2 and Isus4<br/>&gt; &gt; chords have the same number of notes as I chords. And why would<br/>&gt; &gt; you &quot;tune to the subdominant&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, did a Iadd2 there.</p><p>OK, but why relate to the subdominant.</p><p>&gt; Thing is that in 12-t the seventh on the root of a chord<br/>&gt; is played as a b, e.g. Bb for the I7 in C major, so it is tuned<br/>&gt; to the key of the subdominant of the root of the chord, so<br/>&gt; it seems. I think of it that way because it would often<br/>&gt; be used in the progression I7 IV, and of course originally<br/>&gt; V7 I where the V7 there is tuned to the major scale for the<br/>&gt; I chord.</p><p>Right, but *all* the chords are what you would call &quot;seventh chords&quot;<br/>now! This isn&apos;t tonality as you know it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can do I and i for major and minor and the sequence<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of triads in the Pentachordal Major is then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I II III iv V VI VII viii ix x (XI)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Should be tetrads,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I II+ III+ iv VMm VI VII viii ix xmM<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and then for the dominant &quot;seventh&quot; (i.e. ninth) chords it is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I9 II9aug7  III9aug7 iv9 Vm9 VI9 VII9 viii9 ix9 xM9<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; See above. If you want no 9 you can use the no9 symbol.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rightio, can do. As III(9) perhaps? That&apos;s how I do it<br/>&gt; at present in the chord progression player. But why<br/>&gt; - and is this something special about the decatonic<br/>&gt; system if it is based on tetrads rather than triads<br/>&gt; in the roman numeral notation, and if so when generalising<br/>&gt; 12-t to any number of notes per octave how do you decide<br/>&gt; which tunings are tetrad based and which are triads<br/>&gt; based?</p><p>Again, it&apos;s not a matter of generalizing 12, since conventional<br/>notation applies equally well to all meantone systems, but only if a<br/>diatonic basis is assumed -- even in 12. My paper hopefully explains<br/>how diatonic systems (in meantones) relate naturally to triads, while<br/>decatonic systems (in 22-equal and other decatonic tunings) relate<br/>naturally to tetrads.</p><p>&gt; and vio and viio to the minor triads on the ascending</p><p>diminished triads. But classical analysis assumes the &quot;natural&quot; minor<br/>only, and explicitly indicates any alterations such as those you&apos;d<br/>find in the ascending mode. Popular analysis doesn&apos;t use roman<br/>numerals, and just names the chord according to its construction<br/>without regard for context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea there is that the chord symbol gives the desired exact<br/>pitch<br/>&gt; which if the notation used was 22-eq would be 22-eq. But then if<br/>user<br/>&gt; is playing in a just 22 tone scale, each pitch in the chord gets<br/>&gt; played as the nearest pitch in the current scale.</p><p>Why &apos;nearest&apos;, necessarily? If there are 22 notes, wouldn&apos;t you want<br/>to use *all* of them, so have a one-to-one mapping from 22-equal to<br/>them? If the JI scale is a Constant Structure, this will at least<br/>never give you one &apos;consonant&apos; chord quality when you&apos;re expecting<br/>another . . .</p></div>
