No slide rules allowed...  And Fermi<br/>Labs are too busy at the moment calculating the human genome, so<br/>let&apos;s forget about them...</p><p>All calculations should be shown only on the harmonic entropy site,<br/>since some list members have complained about the unnecessary<br/>&quot;clutter&quot; of such high-brow thinking on the Tuning List...</p><p>[No help from Paul Erlich or Dave Keenan on your math homework<br/>allowed either...]</p><p>________ ______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
