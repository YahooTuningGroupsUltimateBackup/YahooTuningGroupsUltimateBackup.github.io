No empirical study of<br/>choral tuning has ever be done, to my knowledge, that would show<br/>how applicable these models are to how choirs sing (or if any<br/>generalization at all can be made about &apos;how choirs sing&apos;).</p><p>&gt;2) If Pythagorean tuning has any advantage for melody, how is it<br/>&gt;to be combined with meantone, with its larger diatonic and smaller<br/>&gt;chromatic semitones?

Generally, it is possible in choirs to draw these from<br/>different source interval sets.  If that makes any sense to you.</p><p>&gt;3) Are there good rules of thumb for avoiding pitch drift in a<br/>&gt;cappella singing while attempting to maintain good tuning of the<br/>&gt;chords?</p><p>Yeah: sing together a lot.

In<br/>counterpoint this is less applicable, but hearing out dominant<br/>melodic fragments is still a good technique.  The amount of<br/>acceptable comma drift should be determined on a per-piece<br/>basis (if you&apos;re good enough to rule out other sources of<br/>drift) -- pieces with lots of key changes may hide comma drift<br/>on their own.  Good beginning practices are singing harmonics<br/>against a drone and then singing full extended otonal chords<br/>a capella, and then known chord progressions with known amounts<br/>of drift, and then...

As to my opinion one should distinguish between the tuning models<br/>of keyboards and the living tuning behavior of human musicians.<br/>The idea of pure thirds has been invented by singers, probably by singers<br/>in the England of the 14th century. Singers as well as human musicians with<br/>string or wind instruments can tune in pure thirds and(!) fifths. Key<br/>instruments<br/>against this have to be tuned to meantone tuning models as soon as they<br/>follow<br/>the idea of pure thirds.

Equal temperament and Pythagorean tuning are pleasant tuning models for<br/>melodic lines, but not for multivoiced music with third and fifth intervals.<br/>Raising leading tones is contrary to the idea of pure thirds. I don&apos;t know<br/>who invented this nonsense, but I know that this idea is still in<br/>the brain of many string instrument players.</p><p>3. A good compromise of combining pure thirds and poor fifths by useful<br/>melodic steps is: Setting equal temperament as a reference line and<br/>tune slightly upwards the frequencies of the root and the fifth in major<br/>chords,<br/>by tuning downwards the thirds - and inverse in minor chords: Tuning the<br/>root and the fifth deeper and the minor third higher.<br/>An example (integers to understand as Cent deviations from ET):<br/>C/ E/ G = +4/ -10/ +6; A/ C/ E = -6/ +10/ -4.<br/>This tuning behavior reduces the risk of pitch drift.<br/>See our website:<br/><a href="http://www.hermode.com">www.hermode.com</a><br/>You will find at &quot;historical&quot; on the end, at &quot;software driven tuning&quot;,<br/>a musical example with diagrams of 4 different ideas of tuning models<br/>in just intonation, each of these  4 ideas with different pitch results.</p><p>4. An additional pitfall is: A major chord in just intonation is an<br/>unequivocal<br/>acoustic structure, easy-to-hear with its 4 : 5 : 6 frequency ratios.<br/>But for minor chords there exist two different ideal frequency ratios:<br/>The 10 : 12 : 15 frequency ratios, showing the same third intervals<br/>like a major chord in just intonation - and the 16 : 19 : 24 frequency<br/>ratios. The last one translated in Cent deviations from ET:<br/>root / minor third/ fifth = 0 / -2 / +2.  This is very tight to ET and<br/>therefore minor chords in ET sound agreeable.<br/>Now, if the choir would follow naive its ears, it could happen as follows:<br/>C/ E/ G = +4/ -10/ +6; E/ G / B(H) = -10/ -12/ -8 (the second E in<br/>correspondence to the first one, the minor chord following<br/>the 16 : 19 : 24 frequency ratios). As a result of this the pitch<br/>drifts immediately downwards.<br/>With other words: Minor chords in just intonation have to be<br/>trained to the high minor thirds of the 10 : 12 : 15 frequency ratios,<br/>one cannot trust to a naive intonation behavior.</p><p>Do you possess a MAC and LOCIC7?

A seven-minute<br/>piece that ends a quartertone lower than it began is not going to bother<br/>anyone except maybe those with absolute pitch, provided the fall is not all in<br/>one place.

It&apos;s true that the resulting melodic intervals<br/>differ considerably from those of meantone, hence my question about<br/>reconciling them. Renaissance choral music is not just a succession of pure<br/>triads. Many pieces have sequences of plain chant inbetween polyphonic<br/>sections, and for these Pythagorean is definitely a much better guide than<br/>meantone. Even in polyphonic sections you&apos;ll sometimes have one voice part<br/>singing alone, e.g. beginning an imitative point. And in those cases where the<br/>leading tone function of a note conflicts with its function as the third in a chord,<br/>I think you have to make an artistic, interpretive judgment as to whether, in the<br/>particular case, to emphasize one over the other, or compromise between<br/>them.</p><p>&gt;A good compromise of combining pure thirds and poor fifths by useful<br/>melodic steps is: Setting equal &gt;temperament as a reference line and tune<br/>slightly upwards the frequencies of the root and the fifth in major chords, by<br/>tuning downwards the thirds &gt;- and inverse in minor chords: Tuning the<br/>root and the fifth deeper and the minor third higher. An example (integers to<br/>understand as Cent deviations &gt;from &gt;ET):C/ E/ G = +4/ -10/ +6; A/ C/ E = -6/ +<br/>10/ -4. This tuning behavior reduces the risk of pitch drift.&lt;</p><p>Yes, this is the sort of &quot;rule of thumb&quot; I was asking for. This is useful. A<br/>somewhat similar one is given by Olivier Bettens in his fine article at <a href="http://virga.org/">virga.org/</a><br/>zarlino, only he uses Pythagorean as the base, and simply raises the root and<br/>fifth in major chords and the third in minor ones, by a full syntonic comma in<br/>each case (chords that are major by chromatic alteration are treated like<br/>minor chords). From the midi examples he gives this sounds far more<br/>workable than I would have expected such a simple &quot;adaptive&quot; algorithm<br/>could be, though I don&apos;t remember any of the examples including comma<br/>shifts on held-over notes, which would be the real test. I would highly<br/>recommend this very judicious article for any who read French (the first few<br/>sections have an English translation).</p><p>&gt;An additional pitfall is: A major chord in just &gt;intonation is an unequivocal<br/>acoustic structure, easy-to-hear with its 4 : 5 : 6 frequency ratios. But &gt;for<br/>minor chords there exist two different ideal &gt;frequency ratios: The 10 : 12 : 15<br/>frequency ratios, showing the same third intervals like a major chord &gt;in just<br/>intonation - and the 16 : 19 : 24 frequency ratios. The last one translated in<br/>Cent deviations from ET: root / minor third/ fifth = 0 / -2 / &gt;+2.  This is very tight<br/>to ET and therefore minor &gt;chords in ET sound agreeable. Now, if the choir<br/>would &gt;follow naive its ears, it could happen as follows: C/ &gt;E/ G = +4/ -10/ +<br/>6; E/ G / B(H) = -10/ -12/ -8 (the &gt;second E in correspondence to the first one,<br/>the minor chord following the 16 : 19 : 24 frequency ratios). As a result of this<br/>the pitch drifts immediately downwards. With other words: Minor chords in just<br/>intonation have to be trained to the high minor thirds of the 10 : 12 : 15<br/>frequency ratios, one cannot trust to a naive intonation behavior.&lt;</p><p>I would agree that, for many reasons, intonation is more problematic for minor<br/>chords than for major ones. In Bettens&apos; midis, for instance, the just major<br/>chords sound nice and pure, but the minor ones sound very rough despite<br/>being in just ratios. The timbre used seems to accentuate the difference tones.</p><p>The 6/5 third, moreover, sounds way too high as a melodic third scale degree<br/>in music in the classical tradition. One violin teacher gives an example from<br/>one of the Bach partitas that begins with a minor chord followed by a<br/>descending scale passage, and recommends that the third degree in the<br/>scale passage be made noticeably lower than in the chord. Other approaches<br/>may be possible, but I don&apos;t think this is necessarily &quot;nonsense.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=58450 href="#58450">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2005 1:19:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Existing theoretical solutions to these problems (&quot;adaptive JI&quot;) are<br/>&gt;&gt;generally too complex to be practiced in a traditional choral setting.<br/>&gt;&gt;One solution -- cuing singers with synthesized tones from headphones<br/>&gt;&gt;-- has been used to good effect by Toby Twining.

A good compromise of combining pure thirds and poor fifths by useful<br/>  melodic steps is: Setting equal temperament as a reference line and<br/>  tune slightly upwards the frequencies of the root and the fifth in major chords,<br/>  by tuning downwards the thirds - and inverse in minor chords: Tuning the<br/>  root and the fifth deeper and the minor third higher.<br/>  An example (integers to understand as Cent deviations from ET):<br/>  C/ E/ G = +4/ -10/ +6; A/ C/ E = -6/ +10/ -4.<br/>  This tuning behavior reduces the risk of pitch drift.<br/>  See our website:<br/>  <a href="http://www.hermode.com">www.hermode.com</a><br/>  You will find at &quot;historical&quot; on the end, at &quot;software driven tuning&quot;,<br/>  a musical example with diagrams of 4 different ideas of tuning models<br/>  in just intonation, each of these  4 ideas with different pitch results.</p><p>  4. An additional pitfall is: A major chord in just intonation is an unequivocal<br/>  acoustic structure, easy-to-hear with its 4 : 5 : 6 frequency ratios.<br/>  But for minor chords there exist two different ideal frequency ratios:<br/>  The 10 : 12 : 15 frequency ratios, showing the same third intervals<br/>  like a major chord in just intonation - and the 16 : 19 : 24 frequency<br/>  ratios. The last one translated in Cent deviations from ET:<br/>  root / minor third/ fifth = 0 / -2 / +2.  This is very tight to ET and<br/>  therefore minor chords in ET sound agreeable.<br/>  Now, if the choir would follow naive its ears, it could happen as follows:<br/>  C/ E/ G = +4/ -10/ +6; E/ G / B(H) = -10/ -12/ -8 (the second E in<br/>  correspondence to the first one, the minor chord following<br/>  the 16 : 19 : 24 frequency ratios). As a result of this the pitch<br/>  drifts immediately downwards.<br/>  With other words: Minor chords in just intonation have to be<br/>  trained to the high minor thirds of the 10 : 12 : 15 frequency ratios,<br/>  one cannot trust to a naive intonation behavior.</p><p>  Do you possess a MAC and LOCIC7? Sorry for making PR -<br/>  but there you will find Hermode Tuning, which is a living,<br/>  self-correcting tuning model so that you could listen to the<br/>  acoustic result of pure thirds and fifths, following the line<br/>  of ET as best as possible.</p><p>  Werner</p></div><h3><a id=58551 href="#58551">ðŸ”—</a>Werner Mohrlok &#x3C;wmohrlok@hermode.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2005 11:15:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>This is perhaps a misunderstanding.
