It&apos;s obviously not percussion in the sense that<br/>it&apos;s in the same instrument family as, for example, a drum.  It&apos;s a<br/>percussion instrument because it produces sound ... well, by percussion<br/>-<br/>things striking other things, in this case hammers striking strings.</p><p>Actually it can be classified with the drum as it is something sounded<br/>by striking.  A drum has a skin, cymbals are sheets of metal, marimbas<br/>are tuned wood, and a pianoforte is a percussive harp. (That is why it<br/>is between the harp and the drums on an orchestral score)</p><p>   My girlfriend&apos;s mom, who teaches piano took exception to that though.<br/>What do you folks think?</p><p>Just a piece of Trivia - Neil Peart of Rush (the drummer) started out as<br/>a piano/keyboard player...<br/>Hmmmm...</p><p>All waves are sound,<br/>All is music.<br/>Alex J Van Wey</p></div>
