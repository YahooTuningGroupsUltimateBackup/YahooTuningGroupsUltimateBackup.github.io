You aren&apos;t required to adjudicate on<br/>whether one result or the other is correct.<br/>They all are (all the ones you can prove).</p><p>BTW (OT), here is a page I found of mathematical proofs set to music.</p><p><a href="http://metamath.planetmirror.com/mmexplorer/mmmusic.html">http://metamath.planetmirror.com/mmexplorer/mmmusic.html</a></p><p>I think they are rather nice.
