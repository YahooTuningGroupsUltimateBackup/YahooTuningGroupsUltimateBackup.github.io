But frankly as an idea I have seen it do more harm than<br/>good. It tends to erect a wall toward the future more than opening things<br/>up.

There is no evidence that our ears stay with limit though in<br/>actual music. That barbershop quartets use 7s but then maybe a 17 in<br/>diminished chords points to how the term 7 limit can interfere with our<br/>perception of these chords. What does calling this 17 limit really tell us.<br/>That dominants can be shown to use even higher harmonic. Especially by<br/>string players.

It&apos;s probably<br/>safe to say that in any scale or chord with more than two pitches, if you have<br/>one N-limit interval you pretty much have to have more than one.  If for<br/>example, you have pitches X, Y, and Z in a chord, and the interval from X to Y<br/>is N-limit, and the interval from X to Z is not, then the interval from Y to Z<br/>is.</p><p>   Actually, that&apos;s true as long as X to Z has a lower limit than N.
