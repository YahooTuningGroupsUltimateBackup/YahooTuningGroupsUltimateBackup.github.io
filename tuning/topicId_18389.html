Will be okay when<br/>I add option to change the pitch bend range to the entire range of MIDI notes<br/>(at least on synths / soundcards that support that).</p><p>(N.b. wave table soundcards can do strange things sometimes with notes well outside the natural pitch<br/>of instruments - I get rather wierd, though nice, descending glissandi and other effects when playing it<br/>on my SB Live wave table synth, and it sounds better on the non wave table one).</p><p>It is just meant as a first preview of what it will be like, but imagine anyone whose been involved<br/>in Monz&apos;s project might be interested to hear it, and comment, at this stage, which is why I posted<br/>it to the TL.</p><p>Will prob. be a few weeks before I get down to doing it properly - some time after starting<br/>on FTS 1.10....</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18431 href="#18431">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/7/2001 1:12:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18389.html#18389">/tuning/topicId_18389.html#18389</a></p><p>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To help with analysing the chord, here it is reduced into an octave:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; neptune venus   earth  mars    saturn jupiter  uranus<br/>&gt; 1/1     78.466  437.38 543.77  580.68 955.44   1166.4 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, making Saturn into the 1/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; saturn jupiter uranus neptune venus   earth    mars<br/>&gt; 1/1    374.8   585.7  619.3   697.8   1057.0   1163.0<br/>&gt; 1/1    5/4~    7/5~   10/7~   3/2~    11/6~    45/23~<br/>&gt; (nearest ratios to within 12 cents)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The nearby ratios as cents are:<br/>&gt; 1/1    386.31  582.51 617.49  701.96  1049.4   1161.9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_11954.html#11995">/tuning/topicId_11954.html#11995</a><br/>&gt; :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &apos;major chord&apos; effect is due mainly to Saturn, Jupiter, and<br/>&gt; &gt; Venus, with Mars reinforcing Saturn 4 &apos;8ves&apos; higher.
