Over the past<br/>twenty years, Dreyblatt has built his own instruments, invented a new tuning<br/>system based on overtones and string resonance, and developed a repertoire<br/>of stunning, rhythmically charged  and harmonically resonant pieces.  Until<br/>recently, all of his music has been played and recorded by his own group,<br/>the Orchestra of Excited Strings.  This month, Dreyblatt has been in<br/>residence with the gamelan, working with students on new instruments and new<br/>works, and performing with a new ensemble which<br/>combines members of Gamelan Galak Tika with members of the New York based<br/>Bang On A Can All-stars.</p><p>This will be the group&apos;s only Boston-area appearance.  Their set of new<br/>works will be preceded by new pieces and installations by his students.<br/>Dreyblatt&apos;s ensemble will perform at approximately 8 pm.</p><p>This concert is FREE!</p><p>The ensemble:<br/>Arnold Dreyblatt, excited bass<br/>Robert Black, double bass and excited bass<br/>Jeff Lieberman, Ar-nodal guitar, excited bass<br/>Laurel Smith, violin, 20-toned hurdy gurdy<br/>Mark Stewart, Ar-nodal guitar, cello, excited bass<br/>Danny Tunick, drums and metal<br/>Evan Ziporyn, hammer piano</p><p>To learn more about Arnold Dreyblatt and this performance, go to the<br/>following links:</p><p>Review of last week&apos;s performance at Tonic in NYC:<br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/arts/20DREY.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/arts/20DREY.html</a></p><p>Information about Arnold Dreyblatt, sound files, etc:<br/><a href="http://www.dreyblatt.net">http://www.dreyblatt.net</a></p></div>
