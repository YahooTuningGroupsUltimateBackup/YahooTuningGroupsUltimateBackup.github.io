Now a prime-based lattice means:</p><p>4th axis: steps of 11:8 have length log(11)<br/>so do steps of 11:5, 11:6, 11:7, and 11:9.</p><p>with the angles in 4-d determined by these lengths all being log(11), in<br/>analogy with the lower-dimensional cases.</p><p>and so on, but since distances are measured using a triangular city-block<br/>metric, and 9:5 is a step of 6:5 and a step of 3:2, the distance<br/>corresponding to 9:5 is log(5)+log(3)=log(15). However, 9:5 is more<br/>consonant than 11:5, which unfortunately has a shorter length of log(11). So<br/>if we wish to keep the construction prime-based (giving a unique location to<br/>each pitch-class), we must posit a &quot;wormhole&quot; making a 9:5 connection with<br/>length log(9). Actually, I don&apos;t know if one actually needs to go into<br/>non-Euclidean space to do this; can anyone calculate the Euclidean length of<br/>a 9:5 in the lattice constructed above? If less than log(9), we can simply<br/>draw a curved line to make the 9:5 connection with length log(9). If the<br/>Euclidean distance is greater than log(9), we need a non-Euclidean &quot;warp&quot; in<br/>space to make this connection, and that is what inspired the term<br/>&quot;wormhole&quot;.</p><p>&gt;In my lattice formula the prime-factoring<br/>&gt;itself makes composite factors such as 9 and 15 shorter<br/>&gt;distances than their odd/integer values would indicate,<br/>&gt;and to me this is the whole point of using prime instead<br/>&gt;of odd factoring.</p><p>What exactly is your lattice formula that gives distances as output?</p></div><h3><a id=2601 href="#2601">ðŸ”—</a>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>4/27/1999 12:11:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul Erlich, TD 156.14:]<br/>&gt; What exactly is your lattice formula that gives distances as<br/>&gt; output?</p><p>Well, we were discussing composites, and my formula doesn&apos;t<br/>give those as outputs directly, but rather as the sum<br/>of their composite prime vectors.</p><p>I suppose that for a simple composite of two prime factors,<br/>the hypotenuse can be calculated from the the two prime<br/>vectors by the Pythagorean theorem.</p><p>For more complicated ratios, I don&apos;t know how to do it<br/>- I would think it&apos;s a trigonometry formula of some kind.</p><p>First I calculate the angle of the vector for each<br/>prime as a function of its Semitone value, assuming<br/>12 o&apos;clock as 0 Semitones and travelling clockwise for<br/>increasing Semitones:</p><p>PrimeAngle = ((3-Semitones)*PI)/6</p><p>Then I simply calculate x and y as the product of the<br/>prime and the number of exponents it has, for each prime<br/>factor in the ratio:</p><p>x = COS(PrimeAngle) * xOrigin * PrimeExponent * prime<br/>y = SIN(PrimeAngle) * yOrigin * PrimeExponent * prime</p><p>&gt; the angle between the first and second axes is determined by<br/>&gt; the condition that steps of 5:3 have length log(5)</p><p>Is there a formula that does this?</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=2612 href="#2612">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/1999 9:44:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 27 Apr 1999 <a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a> wrote:<br/>[Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt;&gt; the angle between the first and second axes is determined by<br/>&gt;&gt; the condition that steps of 5:3 have length log(5)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there a formula that does this?</p><p>The actual, Euclidean distances in our proportional-distance<br/>triangulated lattice are:</p><p>Between 5/4 and 9/8: sqrt((lg5)^2 + 2 * (lg3)^2) = 3.227315...<br/>Between 7/4 and 9/8: sqrt((lg7)^2 + 2 * (lg3)^2) = 3.592416...</p><p>Since lg9 is about 3.169925, the distances are greater than desired, not<br/>lesser, so Paul E.&apos;s curved-line idea doesn&apos;t work.*  Instead, a slight<br/>&quot;spacewarp&quot; is necessary.</p><p>(*As stated, anyway.
