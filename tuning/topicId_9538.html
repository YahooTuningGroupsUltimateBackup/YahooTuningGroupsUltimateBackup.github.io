It will probably be that way for a few weeks or<br/>months longer.</p><p>Since I haven&apos;t been keeping up too closely, I don&apos;t know if<br/>it&apos;s been announced here (if so, my apologies for repeating):</p><p>I&apos;ll be performing my _A Noiseless Patient Spider_ on the Friday,<br/>May 5 concert (at Pomona College in Claremont) as part of<br/>Microfest 2000.  This was added after the original announcement<br/>of the festival here.</p><p>I&apos;m looking forward to meeting lots of LA-area microtonalists,<br/>and (as at Johnny&apos;s AFMM concerts) would be more than happy to<br/>linger long after the concert, talking shop over food and drink.</p><p>-monz</p><p>______________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
