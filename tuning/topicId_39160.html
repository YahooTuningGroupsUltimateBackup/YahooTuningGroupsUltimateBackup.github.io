Being a &quot;dummy&quot; myself, I am<br/>eminently suited to writing the SCALA &quot;dummies&quot; article.  Who<br/>else is going to do it??  (Not Manuel, that&apos;s for sureÂ… :)<br/>[Manuel,<br/>this is a joke; please feel free to &quot;correct&quot; anything I do<br/>hereÂ…]</p><p>I&apos;m presuming you&apos;ve downloaded and installed the software.</p><p>It&apos;s here:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html</a></p><p>Good job! (If that&apos;s not the case, please contact me offlistÂ…<br/>I also apologize to some of the old-time tuners for this rudimentary<br/>SCALA info, but maybe it will be of help to somebody else just<br/>&quot;lurkingÂ…&quot;)</p><p>You also should download the SCALA tuning files, which are also on<br/>that page.  SCALA is very easy to install, since Manuel has a<br/>new &quot;routine&quot; that does it pretty easily.  You don&apos;t even<br/>have to reboot!  How&apos;s that for a good start!</p><p>Anyway, once SCALA 2.5 is up and running, you need to know some very<br/>basic commands.  You can try the so called tutorial by typing in<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/tutorial">@tutorial</a>, and follow along with that, but if you are as stupid as I<br/>am, you&apos;ll only understand part of that.</p><p>How about trying some elementary SCALA commends, just so we can get<br/>this thing to start working:</p><p>First type in  DIR into the little box at the bottom.  You guessed<br/>it!  That will show you the directory of files that is in the root<br/>directory.  Just like in old DOS, you can type in CD also to change<br/>directories.  Let&apos;s just for now save everything in the root<br/>directory for starters.</p><p>Once you type DIR, you will see a very few sample files in the root.<br/>One is called ptolemy.scl!  Guess what!  This is a just<br/>scale.  &quot;Just&quot; what you&apos;re looking for!</p><p>Type in the little box at the bottom:  LOAD PTOLEMY.SCL.  That&apos;s<br/>how, obviously, you get the scale in there!!!  It says now<br/>&quot;Intense<br/>Diatonic&quot; so we know we&apos;re on the right track.</p><p>However, in order to see anything, you have to type another command<br/>in the bottom box:</p><p>SHOW</p><p>Try it!  You&apos;ll like it!  What you see now is the just ratios,<br/>their equivalents in cents, and their interval name, according to<br/>Manuel&apos;s ingenious interval naming system.</p><p>That&apos;s quite a bit right there for analysis.</p><p>However, if like some, you stress the &quot;anal&quot; in your<br/>&quot;analysis&quot; please type in:</p><p>SHOW DATA</p><p>Whoaboy!  I told you that was dangerous.  HOWEVER, the more you look<br/>at it, the more sense it will make.  Stuff like number of intervals,<br/>most common intervals.  I guarantee there is absolutely nothing more<br/>you will ever want to know about this scale.  This is indeed &quot;all<br/>the things you wanted to know about Scale but were afraid to ask!&quot;</p><p>OK, bro, we have now loaded in a scale and analyzed it.  With the new<br/>developments in SCALA  2.5 we can even HEAR it!  You don&apos;t even<br/>have to have MIDI set up, you can use your sound card!</p><p>Type SHOW again, just so we can get back the basic scale:</p><p>Now take your mouse and click on ANALYZE at the very top of the SCALA<br/>menu.  You will see something called &quot;Chromatic Clavier.&quot;<br/>Click it on, and there is your scale!  You have to set the NOTATION<br/>down below to make sure it makes sense for your scale, but once you<br/>have done that, you have the scale right in front of you for<br/>playing!!!  You can just use your mouse to play the pitches!</p><p>If you want triads or chords, just hold down your SHIFT key!  What a<br/>tool, man!</p><p>OKÂ… now lets assume you have a MIDI keyboard set up to your<br/>computer.  Lucky guy!  I bought mine used, too.</p><p>At the menu at top, use your mouse and go TOOLS, RELAY MIDI, and set<br/>it to RELAYING ON.</p><p>Now you can just sit at your MIDI keyboard and play the scale and<br/>various chords.  It&apos;s all you need for an aural analysis.</p><p>Now, you mentioned that you were interested in creating your own<br/>scales to work with.  Not such an outlandish conception, since<br/>that&apos;s why most of use are doing this.</p><p>What you need to know is the SCALA command:</p><p>INPUT</p><p>Try it.  First of all, it asks you the number of notes in your<br/>scale.  Well, how many do you have?</p><p>Then just start entering in ratios.    When you&apos;re finished, type<br/>in, logically SHOW again, and there is your completed scale.  Then<br/>you can play it with the chromatic clavier or, even better, with your<br/>MIDI keyboard to your heart&apos;s content!</p><p>Now here is an important point to remember:</p><p>If you want a ratio just type in a number.  If you type in just 386,<br/>for example, it will become the ratio 386/1!</p><p>However, if what you really meant was the cents value, you must use a<br/>decimal point:  386.. (I actually have a decimal point there, before<br/>the period)</p><p>Then, SCALA will recognize that as an &quot;irrational&quot; or<br/>tempered value, if it happens to be that.</p><p>You can MIX both kinds of input data, ratios and tempered values,<br/>just by including that little decimal point at the end of the<br/>irrational ones.</p><p>Now lets clear your screen, so we can have more fun:</p><p>Type CLS</p><p>Although I know you aren&apos;t specifically interested in this, I<br/>will show you how to easily create an equal-tempered scale.  Easy.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we want 72 equal:</p><p>Type in the little box at the bottom:</p><p>EQUAL 72</p><p>Voila!  That&apos;s all there is to it.  Don&apos;t forget to type in<br/>SHOW or you won&apos;t see anything!!!</p><p>Once you press return a few time so you get the entire scale, you can<br/>go to  ANALYZE at the top menu and play the &quot;Chromatic<br/>Klavier.&quot;  Isn&apos;t 72 fun!  It&apos;s the best scale in the<br/>world (biased<br/>value judgment hereÂ…)</p><p>Ok, while you&apos;re at it, try the TRIAD PLAYER in the same menu.<br/>Wow!  What have they been smoking in the Netherlands??!</p><p>Now I would like to do a little exercise in loading in, analyzing and<br/>copying the text of SCALA files.  After all, Manuel has accumulated a<br/>million scale files, and it&apos;s well worth it to take a look at<br/>some of the scales that other people have created before you!</p><p>In order to implement this, it&apos;s best to use the little included<br/>routine that Robert Walker added to SCALA.  You are welcome to try to<br/>load in a scale on an IBM computer by simply going FILE OPEN by using<br/>your mouse at the top of the screen.</p><p>Sounds logical, yes?  However, I wouldn&apos;t recommend that!  :)<br/>Why?  Well, Manuel has created this program using UNIX code, and the<br/>opening function is supposed to work across several platforms.  As a<br/>result, it doesn&apos;t work very well in the IBM platform.  Try it,<br/>and you&apos;ll see.</p><p>Instead, type the following into the little box at the bottom:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OPEN">@OPEN</a></p><p>Robert Walker wrote this.  You will see it open a little Windows<br/>dialogue box that will let you choose your file.  This is the best<br/>way with an IBM.</p><p>However, there is one more step.  You must type:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/O">@O</a>  in the SCALA box at the bottom (That&apos;s an ohhh, not a zero)<br/>after you have selected your scale in the dialogue box.</p><p>Then don&apos;t forget to type SHOW or you won&apos;t see anything.</p><p>Now you have opened and loaded in a scale, and you can analyze it<br/>using SHOW, or in incredible detail, using SHOW DATA.</p><p>If you want to save your window text, so you can open it in a text<br/>editor or wordprocessor, simply choose the command in the SCALA menu<br/>at the top &quot;FILE&quot; &quot;SAVE WINDOW TEXT TO.&quot;  Choose a<br/>name and you can open this file in MS Word or whatever.</p><p>There, supposedly, is an easy way to just copy this text to the<br/>clipboard, but I&apos;m not getting it to work at the moment, so maybe<br/>Manuel can straighten me out on this when he gets a chance.  It<br/>involves the Robert Walker command <a href="https://twitter.com/COPY">@COPY</a>.</p><p>Of course, once you have your scale opened and analyzed, you can hear<br/>it right away, chords and everything using Manuel&apos;s new MIDI-<br/>interactive features.</p><p>Well, this is the basic tour.  There are many other wonderful and<br/>detailed things that SCALA can do, which you&apos;ll see if you browse<br/>in the HELP file that comes up if you click on HELP in the top SCALA<br/>menu.</p><p>Keep in mind that you can also tune external synths by setting the<br/>synthesizer type and sending a MIDI tuning file to the synth tables.<br/>I do that with my TX81Zs all the time, and that is, frankly, my basic<br/>microtonal composing tool.</p><p>Between Manuel, myself and other people on this list, you should have<br/>all the answers you need.  It might take a little while for some<br/>responses, but probably you won&apos;t have to wait too long.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=39181 href="#39181">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2002 5:20:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Whoaboy!

Really cool front end!!!!!  Can I hear/make any sounds with<br/>&gt;it at this point?</p><p>Sure, if you have a midi file somewhere, you can use Megamid<br/>to play it on your soundcard.<br/>Transforming a midi file with Scala you will probably like to try<br/>out too. See Help-&gt;Making MIDI files.<br/>You can also use it as a midi input to the midi relaying in<br/>Scala, but then you must download and install MidiYoke first.<br/>The installation involves some steps, but the website explains<br/>them clearly, so nothing can go wrong.</p><p>&gt;I simply need more info on the picking the &quot;notation system&quot;. I<br/>&gt;believe it defaults to E12. I need to hear the scale in Just<br/>&gt;Intonation and I noticed that my choices are many in the drop down<br/>&gt;box.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t change the way you hear it, only the note names and<br/>layout of the chromatic clavier. For something completely different,<br/>select &quot;BP&quot; way down, and then click the scale preset button.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=39215 href="#39215">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>10/3/2002 6:30:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt;I downloaded a newer version of Scala to find it but still can&apos;t.</p><p>Go to Analyse-&gt;Show Chord Presence and check &quot;Odd limit search&quot;.<br/>Fill in the odd limit and click the &quot;Change...&quot; button to set the<br/>maximum difference.<br/>Or just type the chord/odd command on the command line.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=39217 href="#39217">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2002 7:21:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39160.html#39212">/tuning/topicId_39160.html#39212</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***What about that, Gene?
