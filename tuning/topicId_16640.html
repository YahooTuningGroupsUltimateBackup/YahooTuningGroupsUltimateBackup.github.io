Here I would like to present a 24-note<br/>tuning new to me -- however many times it may have been previously<br/>discovered or rediscovered -- which may bring together many of these<br/>themes.</p><p>While warmly thanking all the people who have contributed to these<br/>discussions, I would like to dedicate this article especially to John<br/>deLaubenfels, both for his courage as well as inventiveness in daring<br/>to practice and incrasingly to perfect innovative adaptive tuning<br/>techniques, and for a discussion which gives the &quot;new&quot; tuning<br/>discussed here a special significance for me.</p><p>Some weeks ago, John and I shared views about the adaptive just<br/>intonation (JI) system of Nicola Vicentino (1555), discussed in<br/>Section 3 below. Vicentino&apos;s 38-note system, evidently featuring two<br/>19-note manuals in meantone (Gb-B#) tuned 1/4 syntonic comma apart<br/>(~5.38 cents), permits 16th-century sonorities with pure fifths and<br/>minor thirds as well as major thirds (e.g. 4:5:6, 10:12:15).</p><p>Vicentino himself reported the exquisite qualities of this system as<br/>realized in a 36-note version on his archicembalo (&quot;superharpsichord&quot;)<br/>and arciorgano (&quot;superorgan&quot;), but now as then it seems a daunting<br/>task for even the most skilled human keyboardist to negotiate the<br/>concourse of pure sonorities fluently in real time. Happily, the<br/>beauties of Vicentino&apos;s system for 16th-century music can be<br/>demonstrated today by automated technologies ranging from &quot;player<br/>harpsichords&quot; (a la Colin Nancarrow) to MIDI sequencers.</p><p>One effect of this dialogue was to make me yearn for an adaptive<br/>tuning system which I could experience with my own eager but very<br/>modestly agile fingers. Now it is my delight, inspired by the examples<br/>of Nicola Vicentino and John deLaubenfels, to explain how this<br/>yearning has been fulfilled.</p><p>The tuning I am about to present may have a logic analogous in some<br/>ways to Vicentino&apos;s, and features pure versions of some of John&apos;s<br/>favorite intervals and sonorities (e.g. 12:14:18:21, 6:8:9), albeit in<br/>a neo-Gothic musical context differing radically from that of either<br/>Vicentino&apos;s JI system or John&apos;s adaptive tunings.</p><p>Even while writing this article, my viewpoint has been altered and<br/>transformed by two germinal statements leading me into a realm of<br/>neo-Gothic music based on small-integer just intonation (JI), a realm<br/>where Easley Blackwood&apos;s &quot;infatuation with sheer sound quality&quot;<br/>harmoniously coexists with incisive cadential progressions. One of<br/>these inspiring statements is a description of David Doty&apos;s opus<br/>_Uncommon Practice_, a kind of alternative music history in action;<br/>the other is an article by Dan Stearns quoting Blackwood&apos;s passage[1]<br/>on the possible future of music with &quot;pure intervals&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://www.syntonic-rec.com/ucp.html">http://www.syntonic-rec.com/ucp.html</a> (David Doty, _Uncommon Practice_)<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16408">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16408</a> (Dan Stearns on Blackwood)</p><p>Sharing this intonational adventure provides me with an opportunity to<br/>honor another contributor to this List, John Chalmers. Back in 1998,<br/>John remarked to me that a Pythagorean tuning if sufficiently extended<br/>would produce intervals approximating ratios of 7. Out of this remark<br/>grew my 24-note Pythagorean or &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; scheme with two 12-note<br/>keyboards tuned a Pythagorean comma apart, from which it is but a<br/>small step to the present rational adaptive variation featuring pure<br/>fifths and 7-based intervals.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Introduction: What is adaptive just/rational intonation (JI/RI)?<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This 24-note neo-Gothic &quot;adaptive rational tuning,&quot; based on integer<br/>ratios only, consists of two regular 12-note Pythagorean tunings<br/>(Eb-G#) a septimal comma apart (64:63, ~27.26 cents). Using the carat<br/>sign (^) to show a note raised by a septimal comma, we can notate the<br/>tuning as follows:</p><p>      C#^    Eb^             F#^      G#^    Bb^<br/> C^       D^       E^   F^       G^       A^      B^  C^<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>      C#     Eb              F#       G#     Bb<br/> C        D        E    F        G        A       B   C</p><p>In addition to the usual Pythagorean intervals available on each<br/>keyboard, this scheme makes available pure intervals combining factors<br/>of 2, 3, and 7, including 7:6 minor thirds (e.g. E^3-G3); 7:4 minor<br/>sevenths (e.g. E^3-D4); 8:7 major seconds (e.g. D3-E^3); 9:7 major<br/>thirds (e.g. G3-B^3); and 12:7 major sixths (e.g. G3-E^4).</p><p>To reveal the one notable compromise involved, we may look at the two<br/>manuals as 12-note segments of two Pythagorean chains of fifths<br/>separated by the small rational interval known as a septimal schisma<br/>or Eduardo Sa/bat&apos;s &quot;Beta 2,&quot; 33554432:33480783 (~3.80 cents).[2] This<br/>interval is equal to the difference between the septimal comma of<br/>64:63 and the Pythagorean comma (e.g. Eb-D#) of 531441:524288 (~23.46<br/>cents). In the following diagram, Vicentino&apos;s &quot;comma sign&quot; or<br/>apostrophe (&apos;), which could stand for various small intervals,<br/>indicates that the upper chain of fifths is a septimal schisma higher:</p><p>                             (Eb^-Bb^-F^- C^ - G^ - D^ - A^ - E^)...<br/>                             -D#&apos;-A#&apos;-E#&apos;-B#&apos;-F##&apos;-C##&apos;-G##&apos;-D##&apos;...<br/>                             |<br/>-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-</p><p>The fifth connecting the two manuals, G#-D#&apos; (G#-Eb^), is therefore<br/>stretched by a septimal schisma of ~3.80 cents, taking on the large<br/>integer ratio of 16777216:11160261 (~705.76 cents), a size very close<br/>to that of the fifth in 17-tone equal temperament or 17-tET at around<br/>705.88 cents, or about 3.93 cents wide. All other fifths are pure.</p><p>In addition to being a rational intonation (RI) system based entirely<br/>on integer ratios, the scheme is thus an &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; where notes<br/>of a regular tuning are shifted by a small amount in order to obtain<br/>more pure intervals.</p><p>Here the notes of the upper manual are raised by the 3.80-cent<br/>septimal schisma from their positions in a regular 24-note Pythagorean<br/>or Xeno-Gothic tuning, where they would be a Pythagorean comma<br/>(e.g. Eb-D#) rather than a septimal comma (e.g. Eb-D#&apos;) above those of<br/>the lower manual. This shift is comparable to the evident adjustment<br/>of 1/4 syntonic comma (~5.38 cents) in Vicentino&apos;s adaptive scheme.</p><p>As a user of Xeno-Gothic for some two years, I might add that the idea<br/>of adaptively nudging the two manuals apart by an additional septimal<br/>schisma to obtain pure 7-based intervals occurred to me just within<br/>the last few weeks, with a catalyzing role played by Graham Breed&apos;s<br/>schismic temperaments, to which musical lineage this tuning may also<br/>belong (see Section 5).[3]</p><p>Here is a Scala file for the tuning, with notes alternating between<br/>the two manuals:</p><p>! xenoga24.scl<br/>!<br/>Xeno-Gothic rational adaptive tuning, 3-7 ratios (keyboards 64:63 apart)<br/>24<br/>!<br/> 64/63<br/> 2187/2048<br/> 243/224<br/> 9/8<br/> 8/7<br/> 32/27<br/> 2048/1701<br/> 81/64<br/> 9/7<br/> 4/3<br/> 256/189<br/> 729/512<br/> 81/56<br/> 3/2<br/> 32/21<br/> 6561/4096<br/> 729/448<br/> 27/16<br/> 12/7<br/> 16/9<br/> 1024/567<br/> 243/128<br/> 27/14<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here is a keyboard chart using a MIDI-style octave notation with C4 as<br/>middle C.

Musical context and qualities: neo-Gothic JI or RI?<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In a neo-Gothic setting, this tuning takes on lively musical qualities<br/>inviting two intonational outlooks: a &quot;just intonation&quot; (JI) approach<br/>striving consistently to achieve pure ratios for stable and unstable<br/>sonorities alike; and a familiar neo-Gothic approach often favoring<br/>complex Pythagorean ratios for unstable sonorities, which might more<br/>communicatively be termed &quot;rational intonation&quot; (RI).</p><p>In exploring these approaches, we enter the neo-Gothic universe of<br/>stable trines, unstable quads, and &quot;3-flavor&quot; and &quot;7-flavor&quot;<br/>progressions. While seeking to explain relevant terms here as the<br/>narrative unfolds, in good part by example, I would warmly refer<br/>readers desiring a step-by-step presentation of these concepts in a<br/>fuller musical context to the series &quot;A gentle introduction to<br/>neo-Gothic progressions,&quot; much welcoming questions or other feedback:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15038">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15038</a>  (1/Pt 1)<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15630">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15630</a>  (1/Pt 2A)<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15685">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15685</a>  (1/Pt 2B)<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134</a>  (1/Pt 2C)</p><p>A general musical overview of our adaptive JI/RI system might be as<br/>follows:</p><p>(1) All fifths and fourths are pure, except for G#-D# or D#-G#,<br/>&quot;tempered by ratio&quot; a septimal schisma (G#-D#&apos; or D#&apos;-G#).</p><p>(2) Stable three-voice sonorities or trines therefore have pure ratios<br/>of 2:3:4 (e.g. D3-A3-D4) or 3:4:6 (e.g. D3-G3-D4), except that forms<br/>such as G#3-D#4-G#4 or D#4-G#4-D#5 are about as impure as in 17-tET.</p><p>(3) Unstable four-voice cadential sonorities or quads are available in<br/>pure &quot;7-flavor&quot; ratios such as 14:18:21:24 (e.g. G3-B^3-D4-E^4) or<br/>12:14:18:21 (e.g. D^3-F3-A^3-C4); and likewise unstable three-voice<br/>subsets or &quot;triples,&quot; e.g. G3-B^3-E^4 (7:9:12); D^3-F3-A^3 (6:7:9);<br/>D^3-A^3-C4 (4:6:7).</p><p>(4) Mildly unstable &quot;quintal/quartal&quot; triples combining fifths and/or<br/>fourths with major seconds or ninths or minor sevenths are also pure:<br/>e.g. G3-C4-D4 (6:8:9); G3-D4-A4 (4:6:9); G3-C4-F4 (9:12:16).</p><p>(5) Paul Erlich&apos;s 4:6:7:9, in neo-Gothic terms the unstable and<br/>exotically engaging _nona fissa Erlichana_ or &quot;Erlichan split ninth,&quot;<br/>is also available in a pure version (e.g. A^3-E^4-G4-B^4).</p><p>(6) Additionally, either keyboard provides usual Pythagorean versions<br/>of unstable quads and triples featuring complex &quot;3-flavor&quot; ratios:<br/>e.g. G3-B3-D4-E4 (64:81:96:108); D^3-F^3-A^3-C^4 (54:64:81:96);<br/>G3-B3-E4 (64:81:108); D^3-F^3-A^3 (54:64:81); D3-A3-C4 (18:27:32).</p><p>To place some of these intonational features in a musical context, we<br/>might well begin with basic quad-to-trine cadences in their &quot;7-flavor&quot;<br/>and &quot;3-flavor&quot; versions.</p><p>In Gothic or neo-Gothic music, the complete three-voice unit of stable<br/>concord is the _trine_ consisting of outer octave, lower fifth, and<br/>upper fourth, e.g. D3-A3-D4 or F3-C4-F4.</p><p>The most efficient cadential progressions involve motion from an<br/>unstable _quad_ with four voices and four unstable intervals to a<br/>stable trine or its prime interval of the fifth, each unstable<br/>interval resolving by stepwise contrary motion with one voice moving<br/>by a whole-tone and the other by a semitone (M2-4, M3-5, M6-8, m3-1,<br/>m7-5):</p><p>Expansive most proximate quads        Contractive most proximate quads</p><p> Intensive        Remissive              Intensive        Remissive</p><p>   E4  F4          E4  F#4                D4   C4          D4  C#4<br/>   D4  C4          D4  C#4                B3   C4          B3  C#4<br/>   B3  C4          B3  C#4                G3   F3          G3  F#3<br/>   G3  F3    or    G3  F#3                E3   F3    or    E3  F#3</p><p> (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)            (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>An _expansive_ most proximate quad features an outer major sixth<br/>expanding to the octave of a complete trine, while its _contractive_<br/>counterpart features an outer minor seventh contracting to a fifth.<br/>Intensive resolutions of these sonorities have ascending melodic<br/>semitones, while remissive resolutions have descending semitones.</p><p>In our adaptive tunings, these cadences may occur in either &quot;7-flavor&quot;<br/>forms with quads featuring pure 7-based intervals, or in &quot;3-flavor&quot;<br/>forms featuring complex Pythagorean intervals based on powers of 3:2.<br/>For example, here are 7-flavor and 3-flavor versions of the intensive<br/>cadences we have just considered, with sonorities shown as frequency<br/>ratios, and also in rounded cents with respect to the lowest voice:</p><p>                        7-flavor cadences</p><p>      E^4         F4                       D4           C4<br/>      D4          C4                       B^3          C4<br/>      B^3         C4                       G3           F3<br/>      G3          F3                       E^3          F3</p><p> 14:18:21:24     2:3:4                 12:14:18:21     2:3:4<br/>0-435-702-933  0-702-1200             0-267-702-969  0-702-1200</p><p>                        3-flavor cadences</p><p>      E4          F4                       D4           C4<br/>      D4          C4                       B3           C4<br/>      B3          C4                       G3           F3<br/>      G3          F3                       E3           F3</p><p> 64:81:96:108    2:3:4                 54:64:81:96     2:3:4<br/>0-408-702-906  0-702-1200             0-267-702-969  0-702-1200</p><p>Both flavors share pure 2:3:4 trines and incisive cadential semitones<br/>at 256:243 or around 90.22 cents in the usual Pythagorean or 3-flavor<br/>versions (e.g. E3-F3, B3-C4), and a yet more efficient 28:27 or around<br/>62.96 cents in the 7-flavor versions (e.g. E^3-F3, B^3-C4).</p><p>As discussed at more length in Section 2, the streamlined and<br/>&quot;superefficient&quot; 7-flavor cadences may often be favored in either a JI<br/>style seeking pervasive small-integer-ratio sonorities, or an RI style<br/>favoring complex 3-flavor Pythagorean sonorities at many points. For<br/>example, the following cadence from an unstable 7-flavor triple at a<br/>pure 7:9:12 to a complete trine (M6-8 + M3-5) might occur in either<br/>style:</p><p>                 E^3         F4<br/>                 B^3         C4<br/>                 G3          F3<br/>               7:9:12       2:3:4<br/>             0-435-933   0-702-1200</p><p>What distinguishes the two styles is the overall context, as in these<br/>RI and JI versions of a cadential idiom found in various compositions<br/>of the 14th and early 15th centuries:</p><p>       large-integer RI                   low-integer JI<br/>      (7-flavor cadence)               (consistent 7-flavor)</p><p>     A4  G4   F4  E^4  F4             A^4  G^4  F4   E^4  F4<br/>     E4  D4   C4  B^3  C4             E^4  D^4  C4   B^3  C4<br/>     C4  Bb3  A3  G3   F3             C4   Bb3  A^3  G3   F3</p><p>In the RI version, the descending sixth sonorities leading up to the<br/>cadence have 3-flavor or Pythagorean ratios, a complexity nicely<br/>fitting their musical role as &quot;forerunners and handmaidens&quot; of the<br/>coming stable concord, to borrow the evocative words of Johannes Boen<br/>in 1357. Against this &quot;inertial frame&quot; of Pythagorean intonation, the<br/>sonority G3-B^3-E^4 stands out as a point of culminating cadential<br/>tension. Its &quot;stretched&quot; 7-flavor intervals (9:7, 12:7) and the<br/>extra-narrow melodic semitones of approach and resolution (C4-B^3-C4,<br/>F4-E^4-F4) make the final resolution stand out in a special way.</p><p>In the JI version, however, pure 7-flavor intonation is itself the<br/>pervasive norm: we have a stream of 7:9:12 and 18:21:28 sonorities, of<br/>which the penultimate G3-B^3-E^4 is an integral part rather than a<br/>special cadential amplification. Melodically, 63-cent semitones at<br/>28:27 likewise become the diatonic norm (e.g. Bb3-A^3 in the lowest<br/>voice, as well as the cadential B^3-C4 or E^4-F4). The alternating 9:8<br/>and 8:7 whole-tones in the manner of Archytus or al-Farabi (see<br/>Section 2) also lend this pure form of JI a special melodic quality.</p><p>If the RI version represents a usual 3-flavor Gothic rendition<br/>adorned by the accentuated 7-flavor cadence, the JI version might<br/>represent a kind of &quot;neo-Gothic impressionism&quot; recalling Debussy&apos;s<br/>love of sheer sonority. Both renditions share the same cadential<br/>grammar of a series of unstable sixth sonorities leading up to a<br/>stable trine, while varying in vertical and melodic color alike.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>1.2. A 24-quad system: mapping the lattice<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>In addition to 24 notes, our adaptive tuning includes 24 complete<br/>&quot;most proximal quads&quot; of the usual 3-flavor and 7-flavor varieties we<br/>have met in some of the above examples. Expansive versions of these<br/>quads have a major third, fifth, and major sixth above the lowest<br/>voice (e.g. G3-B3-D4-E4), while contractive versions have a minor<br/>third, fifth, and minor seventh (e.g. E3-G3-B3-D4).</p><p>In locating these quads, the following lattice diagram may be<br/>helpful. As explained near the opening of Section 1, a carat (^) shows<br/>a note raised by a septimal comma, and an apostrophe (&apos;) in an<br/>alternative spelling (e.g. D#&apos;) shows a note raised by a septimal<br/>schisma from its usual Pythagorean position:</p><p> D#&apos; A#&apos; E#&apos; B#&apos;<br/> Eb^-Bb^-F^- C^- G^ - D^ - A^ - E^ - B^ - F#^ - C#^ -G#^<br/>            /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /<br/>           /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /<br/>          Eb - Bb - F -  C -  G -  D -  A -  E  - B -  F# - C# - G#</p><p>In this diagram, the eight slanted rectangles joining the two<br/>keyboards indicate pure 7-flavor quads at 14:18:21:24 (expansive) or<br/>12:14:18:21 (contractive). Starting at the left, we begin with the<br/>quad Eb-G^-Bb-C^ (expansive form) or C^-Eb-G^-Bb (contractive form),<br/>concluding at the right with E-G#^-B-C#^ or C#^-E-G#^-B.</p><p>For each of these eight quads, the lowest note of the expansive form<br/>is located at the lower left (e.g. Eb of Eb-G^-Bb-C^); the lowest note<br/>of the contractive form at the upper left (e.g. C^ of C^-Eb-G^-Bb).</p><p>Taking a &quot;close up&quot; look at such a 7-flavor quad may make its<br/>intonational structure clearer:</p><p>           Expansive form                   Contractive form</p><p>       C^4                G^3             C^3              G^3<br/>       933                435              0               702<br/>      12:7                9:7             1:1              3:2<br/>       24 _ _ _ 4:3_ _ _ _18              12 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 18<br/>        /  .    498       /               /             .  /<br/>       /    .            /               /           .    /<br/>      /      .          /               /         .      /<br/>     /       8:7       / 7:6           /      9:7       / 7:6<br/>    /        231      / 267           /     . 435      / 267<br/>   /            .    /               /   .            /<br/>  /              .  /               / .              /<br/> /_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ./               /_ _ _ _3:2_ _ __/<br/>14                21              14       702     21<br/>1:1               3:2             7:6              7:4<br/> 0                702             267              969<br/>Eb3               Bb3             Eb3              Bb3</p><p>Here the numbers at the corners of a rectangle identify each of the<br/>four notes with a frequency ratio number (14-18-21-24 or 12-14-18-21),<br/>and give the tuning ratio and interval in cents of each note in<br/>reference to the lowest voice (1:1-9:7-3:2-12:7 or 1:1-7:6-3:2-7:4;<br/>0-435-702-933 or 0-267-702-969 cents).[4]</p><p>Numbers near the midpoint of a side or inner diagonal of the<br/>rectangle show intervals between upper voices.

From another viewpoint, these regions<br/>offer &quot;nonstandard&quot; variations on the other resolution, for example a<br/>progression with melodic diminished thirds substituted for usual major<br/>seconds[5].</p><p>In addition to the eight most proximal quads in the 7-flavor marked by<br/>the slanted rectangles of our diagrams, each keyboard offers eight<br/>such quads in the usual Pythagorean 3-flavor, adding up to a total of<br/>24 regular most proximal quads in these two flavors.</p><p>Here I have focused mainly on the pure 7-flavor quads, because usual<br/>Pythagorean or 3-flavor quads are discussed at length in &quot;A gentle<br/>introduction to neo-Gothic progressions,&quot; for which URL links appear<br/>at the beginning of Section 1.1. Indeed, each manual is a complete<br/>12-note Pythagorean tuning in itself, and one of the attractions of<br/>this JI/RI system is that the new 7-flavor sonorities and traditional<br/>Pythagorean ones are both there to be used however a given style may<br/>desire.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Easley Blackwood, _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_<br/>(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), p. 153, suggesting that<br/>in a tertian 7-limit setting, JI may gratify an &quot;infatuation with<br/>sheer sound quality&quot; but weaken &quot;harmonic progressions.&quot;</p><p>2. Eduardo Sa/bat, _Principios de la Gama Dina/mica_ (Montevideo:<br/>Arca, 1994), Section 6.3, pp. 208-209, defines Beta 2 (Beta sub-dos)<br/>as the difference between a pure 8:7 major second (~231.17 cents) and<br/>the Pythagorean approximation formed from 14 fifths up minus eight<br/>octaves at 4782969:4194304 (~227.37 cents), a quantity he approximates<br/>by the decimal ratio of 1.00220 (~3.80 cents).</p><p>3. We might consider this a special kind of schisma tuning in which<br/>the full (not-so-onerous) burden of the 3.80-cent septimal schisma is<br/>placed on a single fifth (G#-E^, i.e. G#-D#&apos;) thus &quot;virtually<br/>tempered&quot; or &quot;tempered by ratio.&quot; Since this schisma is itself an<br/>integer ratio, the tuning remains entirely rational-based. Possibly<br/>the category &quot;Rational Adaptive Schisma Tuning&quot; (RAST) might express<br/>both the Vicentino-like and schismic aspects.</p><p>4. Note that the tuning ratios simply represent vertical intervals<br/>with reference to the lowest voice, as opposed to scale steps or the<br/>like. A cadence from the expansive quad Eb3-G^3-Bb3-C^4 to D3-A3-D4,<br/>or from the contractive quad C^3-Eb3-G^3-Bb3 to D3-A3, might occur in<br/>pieces centered on various medieval modes or octave species.</p><p>5. Within the limitations of our 24-note system, we might choose the<br/>variant intensive resolutions of Eb3-G^3-Bb3-C^4 to C#3-G#3-C#4 and<br/>C^3-Eb3-G^3-Bb3 to C#3-G#3. In contrast to usual 7-flavor resolutions<br/>with melodic whole-tones at 9:8 (~203.91 cents) and semitones at 28:27<br/>(~62.96 cents), this variation involves Pythagorean diminished thirds<br/>or small whole-tones (Eb3-C#3, Bb3-G#3) at 65536:59049 (~180.45 cents)<br/>and semitones (e.g. G^3-G#3, C^4-C#4) a septimal schisma smaller than<br/>the usual Pythagorean 256:243 or ~90.22 cents, at the rather imposing<br/>ratio of 137781:131072 (~86.42 cents). Vertical interval sizes remain<br/>unaltered. At the sharp end of the system, intonational variations are<br/>by comparison rather minor, involving the &quot;septimal schisma fifth&quot;<br/>G#-D#&apos; and certain &quot;3-flavor&quot; intervals with this fifth in their<br/>tuning lineages. For example, the remissive cadence F#3-A#&apos;3-C#4-D#&apos;4<br/>to E#&apos;3-B#&apos;3-E#&apos;3 (F#3-Bb^3-C#4-Eb^4 to F^3-C^4-F^4) involves a quad<br/>with major third and sixth a septimal schisma (~3.80 cents) wider than<br/>the usual Pythagorean sizes, and semitone motions (F#3-E#&apos;3, C#4-B#&apos;3)<br/>narrower by the same amount.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16642 href="#16642">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2000 5:46:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, thanks so much for your kind words!</p><p>Your tuning is interesting: in &quot;skipping&quot; 5 but containing pure just<br/>intervals for 2, 3, and 7, there is a connection to the tuning that<br/>La Monte Young uses in some of his piano works (howbeit for a very<br/>different style of music), if I&apos;m not mistaken.</p><p>Is there any chance you could capture some of the music you&apos;ve created<br/>in this tuning set onto an .mp3?
