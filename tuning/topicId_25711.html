Some others may be as well.  Not only have their been<br/>splinter lists that are now drying out or have already folded, but this list<br/>has changed.  Not only have their been people posting flames under fake<br/>names, but this list has been kept unaware of what has been determined.</p><p>There has been a false Mr. Zill, a false Silly Miss Comma-Pump (here fully<br/>acknowledged), and I suspect a false Xavier.  Whether or not the identity of<br/>the prankster is proved, things have substantially changed, at least for me.</p><p>I still see lots of numbers, including cents fractions up to 3 places to the<br/>right of the decimal points, even though there is a math list.  And since I<br/>haven&apos;t been able to join a pantheon of lists, I would be glad for this, if<br/>not....</p><p>My biggest frustration is that the part of music that I have the most to<br/>offer is in performance practice.  This list is clearly not the right place<br/>for this information.  Besides the derision that accompanies what often seems<br/>fantastic, there really aren&apos;t that many individuals on this list that care<br/>about actual people playing actual microtonal music.</p><p>It seems that there is more bullying and more dysfunction than ever.  Now,<br/>this may be true for lots of lists on the Internet, or for people in general.<br/> However, I would rather hold this list to a higher standard.  Perhaps I was<br/>wrong.  Maybe I needed a &quot;microtonal music&quot; list, but I haven&apos;t the time to<br/>moderate or coordinate.</p><p>So much music is going on already.  Pretending it is not is no advantage.</p><p>I hope you all find peace.

I don&apos;t know, Johnny.  There is certainly *me* which is one of<br/>my main things... but you may have felt more comfortable with Jacky<br/>Ligon&apos;s _Practical Microtonality_ which got blown up.

I think that&apos;s what &quot;Crazy Music&quot; is supposed to be... I<br/>would agree with you that a title like &quot;microtonal music&quot; would be<br/>preferable...</p><p>One thing that *I* have learned, and I mean this sincerely, since I<br/>didn&apos;t understand it at first, is that the lists will EVOLVE or<br/>DEVOLVE *NATURALLY*... In other words, if there is a *need*<br/>for &quot;Metatuning&quot; or &quot;Tuning Math&quot; it will stay but, if not, it will<br/>sit dormant.</p><p>It&apos;s kind of Darwinian, but in a pleasant and positive way...</p><p>That&apos;s *my* take, anyway...</p><p>best,</p><p>________ ________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=25739 href="#25739">ðŸ”—</a>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@aracnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 9:52:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; My biggest frustration is that the part of music that I have the<br/>most to<br/>&gt; offer is in performance practice.

Besides the derision that accompanies what<br/>often seems<br/>&gt; fantastic, there really aren&apos;t that many individuals on this list<br/>that care<br/>&gt; about actual people playing actual microtonal music.</p><p>Actual people playing actual microtonal music, live, in the flesh,<br/>here in Portland Oregon, or even nearby Seattle, are hard to find.<br/>Portland has a *thriving* symphony, *two* thriving new music<br/>ensembles, a world-class chamber music festival every summer, a<br/>wonderful classical music radio station, a world-class Bach festival<br/>in Eugene, a couple of hours away, a vibrant pop music scene,<br/>shakuhachi teachers, modern dance companies, and, as far as I can<br/>tell, exactly *one* microtonal composer. He happens to be -- I happen<br/>to be -- a *studio* composer, who works exclusively in the domain of<br/>music composed by and performed by digital computers, not live<br/>performances. And this composer has a demanding full-time day job and<br/>two other hobbies :-).</p><p>The closest model I&apos;ve found for my situation is, I suppose, Charles<br/>Ives, who had a comfortable day job in the insurance business and<br/>found the time somehow to change the face of American music forever.<br/>Am I that good? Probably not. However, my previous compositions, most<br/>of which I&apos;ve lost over the years, are unlike anything I&apos;ve heard<br/>elsewhere, and given the primitive tools I had to work with when I<br/>did them, are nothing to be ashamed of. I wish I knew where the tapes<br/>were.</p><p>But where do I go to hear *new* microtonal music live? I&apos;ve got all<br/>the CDs I can find, and I&apos;ve downloaded most of the music posted by<br/>the folks on this list. Short of hauling off and moving to New York,<br/>the only way I&apos;m going to hear *live* microtonal music is by hiring a<br/>hall and playing my own.</p><p>&gt; So much music is going on already.  Pretending it is not is no<br/>advantage.</p><p>You are very lucky to live where it *is* going on in live<br/>performances. The beauty of the Internet is that, at least for us<br/>*studio* musicians, we can play to the world and listen to the world<br/>now. I&apos;ve spent the past few months plowing through the writings of<br/>Partch and Xenakis, the two composers who have influenced me the<br/>most. I&apos;ve found some common threads -- ancient Greek music, for<br/>example -- and there is quite a bit of synergy.</p><p>I am in the design stages of software to integrate their two<br/>theories, software which will ultimately create music for me to sit<br/>and listen to, capture and possibly even publish. It will be<br/>microtonal/xentonal, it will be generated by a computer and it will<br/>be algorithmically composed -- of that much I am certain, though of<br/>little else at the moment.</p><p>I certainly don&apos;t intend to let list shenanigans and flame wars deter<br/>me from what I&apos;m doing, and I have no expectations of fame or<br/>fortune -- not even expectations of recognition, for that matter. I&apos;m<br/>doing it because I want to and because I can. And somehow I suspect<br/>most of the other people on this list and all the other &quot;tuning&quot;<br/>lists are doing what they want to do and what they can do as well.<br/>--<br/>M.
