I noticed that it had a very nice sound when I<br/>thunked it. I suspended it over two cardboard boxes and<br/>played it for a while, noticing the wide variety of sounds<br/>I was able to get out of it.</p><p>Then I noticed that it happened that many of the crossbar<br/>pieces for the shelves, as well as some leftover scraps,<br/>were between 18 and 27 inches long.</p><p>I laid out a couple of long boards in a nonparallel<br/>configuration and then started placing the smaller boards<br/>on top of this. I adjusted the positions of the smaller<br/>boards while thunking them until I got the best tone. Some<br/>of the boards did not sound as good, and I put them aside<br/>to be the actual ones that would be used in the shelves.<br/>Then I raised the bass end up various heights until I<br/>found the height that made the sound loudest from the<br/>sound waves going down to the concrete garage floor and<br/>back -- so the open space below the xylophone served as a<br/>simple resonator.</p><p>Then I went and got some mallets - both solid wood, and<br/>wood covered at the end with tightly wrapped rubber<br/>innertube.</p><p>And played the xylophone.</p><p>And it sounded _really_ good - I mean great, absolutely<br/>fantastic. The tuning was just like a gamelan tuning and<br/>the tone was reminescent of Jegog of Negara. In fact, I<br/>probably could not have come up with a better tuning<br/>myself. And no, I will not list it in cents values. The<br/>whole idea here is it is random. Everyone should build<br/>their own shelves! Or perhaps you will be putting in some<br/>copper pipes and have some copper tubing scraps left over,<br/>or what have you. You don&apos;t need to construct formulas and<br/>mathematical theories and cut things to precise lengths<br/>and meticulously adjust them to just the right pitch. Not<br/>unless you want to. What I am saying is you can get just<br/>as good results by randomly picking up pieces of wood<br/>scraps and arranging them.</p><p>The chickens heard me playing and wandered into the garage<br/>and watched me playing, happily excited and mesmerized. I<br/>knew that chickens liked _harmonic_ sounds like singing<br/>and humming and speaking to them in a sing-song voice. But<br/>the xylophone was definately not harmonic. It was quite<br/>inharmonic and also very percussive and quite loud... just<br/>the sort of thing you would thing a chicken would not<br/>like. But they definately liked the music. In fact, they<br/>were crazy about it. I tried different styles and found<br/>that they liked it regular. If the rhythm or melody got<br/>erratic, they became alarmed. They had different reactions<br/>to different melodies. One of the hens sat down in front<br/>of me and tried to lay an egg. This was extremely unusual<br/>behavior -- hens like privacy, quiet and darkness to lay<br/>their eggs. They can not *stand* to have someone watch<br/>them when they are trying to lay an egg and will actually<br/>blush if that happens. But this hen seemed to want my<br/>attention, wanted me to notice that she was trying to<br/>present an egg because of her respect and admiration for<br/>the xylophone. After I went inside, the hen went into the<br/>newspaper bin sitting on a shelf above the xylophone and<br/>laid an egg there.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=22451 href="#22451">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2001 3:11:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;J Scott&quot; &lt;xjscott@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22446.html#22446">/tuning/topicId_22446.html#22446</a></p><p>&gt; I was building some elaborate shelves in the garage out of<br/>&gt; 2x4s and 2x6s (a 2 by 4 is a board 1.5 by 3.5 inches by<br/>&gt; however many feet long and is used in framing houses most<br/>&gt; commonly) made of Douglas Fir, a local softwood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At some point I was playing with an 8 foot long 2x4 that<br/>&gt; had really good straight grain with no knots, but was<br/>&gt; warped.

It&apos;s simply a bunch of<br/>different-length 2x4s tied together with rope.  So it&apos;s<br/>extremely portable (just an armful of wood and string),<br/>and can then be lain down on a towel on any hard surface<br/>and played like a marimba.</p><p>I got a chance to do some serious jamming on it back in<br/>January at an awesome percussion improv session at Club Xanth<br/>here in my neighborhood, which I&apos;m *really* sorry we didn&apos;t<br/>record.</p><p>I have a bit of personal experience in this too, having<br/>easily modified a regular acoustic guitar into my &quot;Rational<br/>Guitar&quot; by sanding the frets down flush with the fingerboard<br/>and simply pasting a paper diagram onto the fingerboard<br/>which had the fret placements marked and ratios written<br/>next to them.  Then I put plastic laminate over that,<br/>and broke toothpicks into small enough pieces to make<br/>individual frets, and glued them on.  And so I had (and<br/>still have) a guitar which could play all harmonics from<br/>the 4th to the 27th (some of them adjusted to a &quot;wrong&quot;<br/>&quot;octave&quot;).</p><p>The biggest disadvantage is that the guitar is tuned entirely<br/>to one key, the 1/1-otonality, and so the only way I can<br/>modulate with the same interval structures is to go into<br/>3/2-otonality and to a more limited extent to 9/8- and<br/>5/4-otonalities.  I had an earlier design that gave the<br/>entire 11-limit tonality diamond, but I changed my mind,<br/>now to my regret.  But the guitar as it stands gives me<br/>interesting &quot;new&quot; harmonic structures when I modulate into<br/>other keys and only have harmonics of 1/1 available.</p><p>Hmmm... I suppose it should have been named &quot;Harmonic Guitar&quot;<br/>instead...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
