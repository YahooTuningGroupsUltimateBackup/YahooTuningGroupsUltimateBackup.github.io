Of<br/>course, over the course of the years, I listen to tons of music that I<br/>like...these are the ones that immediately come to mind...how about the<br/>rest of youse guys/girls...?

I suppose i need to add<br/>to that by giving a list (again in no particular order) of mainly 20th<br/>centuary music which I think will survive, or ought to in a proper<br/>world (:-)</p><p>Lutoslawski&apos;s String Quartet [1965] (one of the best from the last<br/>centuary); Montagues&apos; String Quartet #1 [1989-93]; Birtwistle&apos;s opera<br/>&quot;Gawain&quot;; Birtwistle&apos;s opera &quot;Punch and Judy&quot;; Judith Weir&apos;s opera<br/>&quot;King Harald&apos;s Saga&quot; [1979]; Bartok &quot;Duke Bluebeard&apos;s castle&quot;, and<br/>string quartets; Xenakis, many works (well actually all!), but Haar<br/>and Ikhoor stand out; Ali Rakha; Ustaad Villyat Khan; Schnittke&apos;s<br/>Concerti Grossi; (and for the microtonal fans) Seamus Ennis,<br/>especially his slow airs; Wagner of course; JS Bach (one of the gods<br/>with Wagner and Xenakis), especially the &apos;Cello Suites; Nancarrow<br/>studies or player piano; Tippett&apos;s operas,especially Priam and<br/>Midsummer Marriage, and Ice Break, and New World, and ......; oh and<br/>his string quartets, #5 for choice; Bruckner #9; Janacek string<br/>quartets and operas (why do string quartets feature in this list?  I<br/>used to hate the violin!); Balamurali Krishna; Warren Burt&apos;s dissonant<br/>sonatas, especially #13; R.Strauss&apos;s Metamorphosen, and the 4 last<br/>songs....</p><p>There are other things I like but cannot convince myself that they are<br/>cosmic, like Billy Brag and Woody Guthrie (I had to include some<br/>guitar I guess), Roy Orbison, John Lennon, and Puccini.</p><p>I also like Boulanger&apos;s At last, Free, and my own Drums and Different<br/>Canons #1, but those are not really the same.</p><p>The above does not mention Haydn, or Dowland, with whom I seem to<br/>share a common world-view.</p><p>Like Hstick I listen to a great deal of music, most of the day and<br/>evening actually (Part and Schnittke tonight), and some things stand<br/>out, but Bach, Haydn, Wagner, Bruckner and Xenakis are above the crowd.</p><p>What I do notice is the lack of commonality with Neil&apos;s list except<br/>for a passing reference to Bartok.  And a lack of &apos;popular&apos; music in<br/>my list, and I am not very interested in the guitar.</p><p>==John ffitch</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/28/2001 8:51:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20266">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20266</a></p><p>Hello Neil!</p><p>You have here a VERY eclectic and modern list...
