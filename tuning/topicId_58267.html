Are we resolved?</p><p>Dave finished with:<br/>Tom, please note that on this list, the unqualified use of the terms<br/>&quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot; would usually be assumed to be indepenent<br/>of traditional ideas of cadence, since this is after all a list<br/>devoted to &quot;alternate&quot; tunings.</p><p>[Yahya]:<br/>Still, many of these &quot;alternate&quot; tunings are quite<br/>historical and traditional ones, including eg<br/>1/6-comma meantone, and were arguably the vehicles<br/>of many cadences that have thereby become traditional.</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.10.2 - Release Date: 21/4/05</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2005 4:27:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Dave Keenan replied:<br/>&gt; Hmm.

You<br/>just need to explain which one you mean if it isn&apos;t otherwise clear<br/>from the context.</p><p>&gt; Dave continued:<br/>&gt; Also, &quot;unstable chord&quot; has been used for the latter,<br/>&gt; where &quot;unstable&quot; means &quot;requiring resolution&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Yahya]:<br/>&gt; How about &quot;unresolved&quot; then.  Are we resolved?</p><p>No we are unresolved. :-) Whether or not a chord is &quot;resolved&quot; is a<br/>question of what happens next, not a property of the chord itself,<br/>even in the context of a particular tradition. A chord may be unstable<br/>and yet be allowed to remain unresolved in a particular passage.</p></div>
