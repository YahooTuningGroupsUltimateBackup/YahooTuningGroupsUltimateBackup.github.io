His earliest JI compositions used an<br/>extended 1-dimensional pythagorean 3-limit system (i.e.,<br/>ratios using prime-factors of only 2 and 3), then he progressed<br/>to an expanded version of &quot;classic&quot; 5-limit JI, then in subsequent<br/>works to higher and higher prime-limits. His most recent<br/>compositions use all prime-factors up to 31. In Johnston&apos;s<br/>music, as in most music, prime-factor 2 is considered to be<br/>the &quot;equivalence-interval&quot;. Tonescape software models<br/>tuning systems as iterations of generators, with each generator<br/>in its own dimension. Tonescape can model tuning systems<br/>of up to 7 dimensions, thus, leaving prime-factor 2 out of the<br/>Lattice diagram, in 7 dimensions it can model 19-limit JI.<br/>Tonescape shows a Pitch-Height score in real time, and<br/>also highlights the notes being playing on the Lattice in real time.<br/>Some movements from Johnston&apos;s string quartets are presented<br/>as example Tonescape files.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=66064 href="#66064">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2006 1:46:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Great work monz!

He was not<br/>able to attend the symposium in his honor, but was available through a<br/>video conferencing hookup and gave a talk about his life and<br/>&quot;revisionist&quot; compositional style expanding the tonal resources<br/>through his extended just intonation notation. His notation has become<br/>for many, the standard of the recent just intonation composition work<br/>by contemporary just composers. Joe Monzo is working on the inclusion<br/>of this notation in the Beta release of Tonescape coming out later<br/>this year.</p><p>There were presentations of several lectures during the day including<br/>Johnston&apos;s publisher Sylvia Smith, Craig Grady, Joe Monzo, Bill Alves,<br/>Kyle Gann, John Schneider, and T.J. Troy. All of the presentations<br/>focused on different aspects of Johnston&apos;s work, and several were<br/>about pieces that were later performed at that evening&apos;s performance.<br/>The conference was also attended by 1/1 editor and Just Intonation<br/>Network workhorse David Doty, and long time microtonal supporter and<br/>Xenharmonikon editor John Chalmers. The concert included solo pieces<br/>on contra-bass, piano, clarinet and guitar/voice, and duets on violin<br/>and piano (mallets on the piano structure).</p><p>Sonic Arts Gallery has recently compiled four new &quot;Studio Logs&quot; which<br/>were available for conference-goers.  These two to three hour MP3&apos;s<br/>represent a selection of the Electronic Microtonal Improvisation work<br/>of Jonathan Glasier and Brink McGoogy during the first three months of<br/>2006.  They are a soft mix down from ADAT to CD and transferred to the<br/>MP3 format. They are available through Sonic Arts (P.O. Box 620027,<br/>San Diego 92162) for ten dollars ($10) each plus two dollars shipping.</p><p>Microfest continues through the end of May with performances of the<br/>music of Lou Harrison, Craig Grady and Harry Partch.
