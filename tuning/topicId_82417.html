You don&apos;t get that nagging soggy feeling of knowing what an interval &quot;should&quot; be (due to the reference in the spectra), which often happens (to my ears) with &quot;good&quot; approximations. Rather, you get a harmonic-series-neutral, so to speak, interval. This happens in the 19-tone tuning Graham just posted (with its 2cos(Pi/6) interval filling out a tetrad nicely, rather than a pure or tempered 7/4).<br/>&gt; So- it&apos;s so &quot;out of tune&quot; that it doesn&apos;t sound out of tune, for you cannot scan what it &quot;should&quot; be and settle on hearing it on the one ear for what it &quot;is&quot;, a sound, and in the other ear in terms of scale step/interval.</p></div><h3><a id=82525 href="#82525">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2009 9:55:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Kalle,</p><p>I appreciate your openess to such different aproaches.<br/>Never heard of those theories.

Just like patenting living species is totally outrageous I think, I would suggest that no one using noble numbers or their series should be allowed to claim any property on them (even Fibonacci ! but this exception can be done because his series is<br/> the world famous mathematical exemple).In my collection to this day, only three noble numbers can be considered as &quot;traditionnal&quot; :The golden ratio (out of which I resolved the fractal waveform called &quot;Phidiane&quot;), present in many plants.Narayana (known by the indians and mentionned in the famous tale &quot;Narayanan &apos;s cows&quot;) = 1,4655712319Natt&eacute; (known by the greeks and also named &quot;number of the architects&quot;) &nbsp;= 1,3247179573These are the only three I heard of related to traditionnal sources, after I did my own experiments.If anyone knows of any others, or has any sources on them, I would be grateful to know.Of course I heard of&nbsp;the Mt Meru scales, since&nbsp;almost each time I would mention any coherent recurrent sequence&nbsp;on the tuning list,&nbsp;their link would have been posted. I have a total admiration for Erv Wilson, that I take for one the greatest living microtonal music theoricians and more than that, and&nbsp;I hope to have the chance to meet him some day<br/> because we surely would have much to exchange. But just for information, before I ever heard of the<br/> Mt Meru Scales, I had been working for years on these subjects, and had already composed disks and music in most of the Mt Meru scales.&nbsp;Anyway those are part of my collection, along with a few others from different searchers and I will be glad to welcome any more.</p><p>About divisions of the Phi-ave (1,618) :What I have been using, in enough small intervals as to get a glissando-wind effect between them (out of the Phi fractal timber), was divisions in increasing number, each in the next Fibonacci&nbsp;number each Phi-ave going up &nbsp;:&nbsp;1 &nbsp;2 &nbsp;3 &nbsp;5 &nbsp;8<br/> &nbsp;13 &nbsp;21 &nbsp;34 &nbsp;55 89 144 233 (I went up to 288)...This leads to some kind of &quot;golden&quot; harmonic series and&nbsp;I am giving you the ratios for the division in 13 :1,00000001,055728091,09016991,1458981,201626121,23606797751,291796071,326237921,3819661,43769411,4721359551,5278640451,583592135&nbsp;I believe these frequencies to allow the maximum of differential coherence between inside the whole scale (including lower phi-aves of course).You can test it by multiplying each of these numbers by any Fibonacci number (over 55 in that division), and check that you get something close to a whole number, ex. here :&nbsp;&nbsp;55 &nbsp; &nbsp; 58 &nbsp; &nbsp;60 &nbsp; &nbsp;63 &nbsp; &nbsp; 66 &nbsp; &nbsp;68 &nbsp; &nbsp;71 &nbsp; &nbsp;73 &nbsp; &nbsp;76 &nbsp; &nbsp; 79 &nbsp; &nbsp; 81 &nbsp; &nbsp;84 &nbsp; &nbsp; 87 &nbsp; &nbsp;89, &nbsp; or144 &nbsp;152 &nbsp;157 &nbsp;165 &nbsp;173 &nbsp;178 &nbsp;186 &nbsp;191 &nbsp;199 &nbsp;207 &nbsp;212 &nbsp;220 &nbsp;228 &nbsp;233, &nbsp;etc...This will give you an infinity of rationnal approximations,&nbsp; each Phi-ave offering different versions.Of course you could think of choosing between<br/> different Phi-aves in order to collect some of the simplest possible ratios. Why not, but doing like so would result in a global loss of differential coherence.Normally if you have already some of the same<br/> ratios in your scale these should be from the series F, 2F, 4F, 8F etc., if I understand what you did. You&apos;ll find out that I am using not only those but 3F, etc. and also different golden series such as the series P, L, S &nbsp;: &nbsp;1,381966 for example comes from the plain P series. You will have no difficulty I think to find its exact ratio issued from V5.&nbsp;Does this helps your purpose ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Jacques</p><p>Posted by: &quot;djtrancendance@ <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a>&quot; djtrancendance@ <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a> &nbsp; djtrancendanceMon Mar&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2009 2:40&nbsp;pm (PDT)--Thanks Jacques, this is fascinating stuff!

More rationnal.<br/>I&apos;ve always been attracted by ambiguous intervals myself, and I&apos;ve<br/>been wandering why I like half intervals - probably because they<br/>create instable equilibrums between a scale and its reversed form, in<br/>a mirror fashion.<br/>I love particularly for example a note that divides an eventual 4/3<br/>inside a slendro in two semifourths, or when any minor third is<br/>splitted in two like in the bulgarian voices,  or, when I can&apos;t find<br/>the &quot;semitones&quot; in a tha&iuml; scale.<br/>Likewise, yes, noble numbers do avoid simplest ratios and create<br/>tensions between them, that&apos;s where they open new harmonies.<br/>When used in architectures, acoustics are better because you have<br/>less chances to find unbalanced responses in the amplification :<br/>the room becomes transparent.</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques Dudon</p><p>&gt; By the way my math interest in the &quot;shadow&quot; intervals comes from<br/>&gt; having found them by ear, trying to find the &quot;floating&quot; points<br/>&gt; between Just intervals, and then trying to figure out how to<br/>&gt; describe them mathematically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To my ears, shadow intervals work in &quot;temperaments&quot; as well as<br/>&gt; tunings. You don&apos;t get that nagging soggy feeling of knowing what<br/>&gt; an interval &quot;should&quot; be (due to the reference in the spectra),<br/>&gt; which often happens (to my ears) with &quot;good&quot; approximations.<br/>&gt; Rather, you get a harmonic-series-neutral, so to speak, interval.<br/>&gt; This happens in the 19-tone tuning Graham just posted (with its 2cos<br/>&gt; (Pi/6) interval filling out a tetrad nicely, rather than a pure or<br/>&gt; tempered 7/4).<br/>&gt; So- it&apos;s so &quot;out of tune&quot; that it doesn&apos;t sound out of tune, for<br/>&gt; you cannot scan what it &quot;should&quot; be and settle on hearing it on the<br/>&gt;

Also, for JI nuts, the two harmonic series it is composed of (x/16 and x/12) are easily visible and all denominators are factors of 2.<br/>------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Minuses: PHI does 7-note per 2/1 standard period (octave) chords not too much worse (like comparing &quot;sour&quot; 12TET to 5-limit JI consonance) and allows up to about 9-notes per 2/1 with hardly any difference in consonance and up to about 11 notes per 2/1 octave worth of melodic possibilities.<br/>******************************************************************************************<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion: difference tones make a WORLD of a difference, even if you hate the idea of using noble numbers to create scales and just want to use difference tones to optimize your<br/> JI.</p><p>&nbsp;
