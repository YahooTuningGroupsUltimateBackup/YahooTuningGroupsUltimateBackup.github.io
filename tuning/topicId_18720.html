To have to write double sharps and flats would be a<br/>pain in the_____. Also it is quite easy to recognize and write the<br/>symbols quickly and the more differentiated symbols are, the better. To<br/>find them on a typewriter is also good.  Back in the 70&apos;s when Wilson<br/>was writing in Xenharmonikon, much of his notationals were built upon<br/>Yasser&apos;s, still one can find the above and other notational methods (<br/>that can be applied to many different tunings BTW) at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a> especially the first three issues<br/>of xenharmonikon.<br/>In fact, I still use this notation for my use in the 22- tone just<br/>eikosany,  which might seem odd, but since I have played this instrument<br/>with my 31 tone marimba ( full dallesandro tuning= full 1-3-5-7-9-11<br/>CPS), I could not see having a different tuning for different<br/>instruments). Depending on the musical context, we should remember that<br/>any notational system will sooner or later tend to have enharmonic<br/>equivalents for the same pitch. When devising a notional system, these<br/>too should be kept in mind!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
