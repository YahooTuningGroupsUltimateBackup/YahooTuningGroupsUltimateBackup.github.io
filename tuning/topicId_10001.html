Does anyone have any experience or suggestions with this sort of<br/>thing? Since it would have only harmonic partials and the pitch would be<br/>determined solely by the length of the air column, the calculation of the<br/>hole positions would be much easier than the infamous wind chimes.</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan P</p></div>
