Of course the explanation is found writing down the partials as<br/>notes and analysing pairs of partials and beats: the situation changes<br/>dramatically due to the structure of the harmonic series. Yet it depends<br/>strongly on the type of instruments also, and there is sure an element of<br/>personal taste as well.</p><p>Unfortunately the &quot;web magic&quot; disguises the sad fact that we members of this<br/>list are dispersed in all corners of the Globe. HOWEVER; if anybody feels<br/>like meeting in a small group somewhere in Europe for a couple of days,<br/>computers and tuning hammers at hand, I will be just very happy to play host<br/>in our home in Bray, just South of Dublin, Ireland, with views of the<br/>Wicklow mountaints (well hills actually) and decent musical equipment.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Claudio</p></div><h3><a id=82203 href="#82203">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2009 7:56:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, Claudio, general image of harpsichord is that it has very well pronunciated, concrete, rich and sharp sound full of higher harmonics, beats from detuned unison, octave coupling, and there&apos;s also strong inharmonic transient caused by plucking, so harpsichord tuning is very important and dissonances are to hear easily.

Huygens acht het consonant, al heeft het een afwijkend karakter van de in zijn tijd gebruikelijke intervallen. Het is iets kleiner dan het interval fa-si in het do-re-mi geslacht, dat drie tonen bevat en als diatonische tritonus (45/32) onderscheiden kan worden van de harmonische tritonus (7/5). Huygens vindt in de harmonische tritonus een eigen schoonheid. Hij herinnert aan de vergissing der antieken, die de terts als dissonant verwierpen, terwijl deze later zo vanzelfsprekend genoten werd. Hij waarschuwt dat men ten aanzien van de zevende harmonische niet in dezelfde fout moet vervallen. Geen wonder dat hij het een voordeel acht van zijn di&euml;zenstemming, als deze blijkt ook de intervallen met het getal zeven tot hun recht te doen komen. Dat dit zo is rekent men als volgt vlug na. De harmonische tritonus 7/5 is bijna de helft van een oktaaf. Zijn supplement is 10/7. Het verschil tussen de harmonische tritonus en zijn supplement is 50/49, iets kleiner dan de enharmonische di&euml;ze 128/125 - goed beschouwd 0,9 normale di&euml;ze. &quot;</p><p>&gt; found it by ear alone.<br/>as already Huygens discoverded that in<br/><a href="http://diapason.xentonic.org/ttl/ttl06.html">http://diapason.xentonic.org/ttl/ttl06.html</a></p><p>bye<br/>A.S</p></div>
