It<br/>has a terrible reputation. So the point of this experiment was to see<br/>how people would perceive it without any priming beforehand. I wanted<br/>to see if they&apos;d hear it as being so wildly discordant to the point of<br/>unintelligibility that they&apos;d just guess &quot;9&quot; because it sounds so bad,<br/>or if they&apos;d hear it as just being a little worse than the first one,<br/>meaning they&apos;d guess something like 16 or 25.</p><p>Since we&apos;ve been talking a lot about what constitutes &quot;tonality&quot; and a<br/>sense of &quot;key&quot; recently, it&apos;s of particular theoretical note that it&apos;s<br/>possible to write 5-limit &quot;tonal&quot; music, distinguishing between major<br/>and minor and all that, in 9-EDO.</p><p>I&apos;ve always thought that it&apos;s likely that there&apos;d be a place for<br/>&quot;novelty&quot; tunings in terms of how this stuff is marketed to the<br/>public. The general idea around here is that progress is attained by<br/>moving to higher-numbered EDOs like 19, 22, 31, etc, so as to attain<br/>greater harmonic accuracy. But I&apos;ve always thought it might be<br/>possible for the general public&apos;s first foray into microtonality to be<br/>in the form of something like 7-equal, because it&apos;s actually simpler<br/>to think of (zero learning curve), has a certain &quot;charm&quot; to it, and<br/>sounds xenharmonic right off the bat. It&apos;s a good way to wean folks<br/>off of 12 because it&apos;s easy, just for fun, and immediately sounds<br/>different. But now I think that 9-EDO would be more likely to catch on<br/>than 7, because 9 actually distinguishes between major and minor<br/>chords and supports tonal harmony. You obviously aren&apos;t going to want<br/>to choose 9-EDO if you&apos;re looking for a near-optimal tuning for<br/>mavila, but if you&apos;re playing on a flute or kalimba or something you<br/>might actually like 9.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100060 href="#100060">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2011 3:37:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jun 14, 2011 at 6:33 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since we&apos;ve been talking a lot about what constitutes &quot;tonality&quot; and a<br/>&gt; sense of &quot;key&quot; recently, it&apos;s of particular theoretical note that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; possible to write 5-limit &quot;tonal&quot; music, distinguishing between major<br/>&gt; and minor and all that, in 9-EDO.</p><p>It also means that it might be time to take another look at<br/>hemiennealimmal.

A tuning that requires people to think less, rather than<br/>more, but also provides some kind of immediate xenharmonic flavor<br/>would probably catch on as a neat little one-trick pony novelty type<br/>deal. Like 5-equal, for example, which sounds like some kind of<br/>oriental-ish pentatonic scale right off the bat. Or 7-equal, for<br/>example, which to a meantone ear is a sort of interesting equal<br/>diatonic scale. 5-equal gets old quick; 7-equal slightly less so but<br/>still does better. 9-equal is both a one-trick novelty pony, but also<br/>supports tonal harmony, so it&apos;s more interesting than the other two.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100071 href="#100071">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2011 7:09:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It was an interesting experiment.

It<br/>&gt; has a terrible reputation. So the point of this experiment was to see<br/>&gt; how people would perceive it without any priming beforehand. I wanted<br/>&gt; to see if they&apos;d hear it as being so wildly discordant to the point of<br/>&gt; unintelligibility that they&apos;d just guess &quot;9&quot; because it sounds so bad,<br/>&gt; or if they&apos;d hear it as just being a little worse than the first one,<br/>&gt; meaning they&apos;d guess something like 16 or 25.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since we&apos;ve been talking a lot about what constitutes &quot;tonality&quot; and a<br/>&gt; sense of &quot;key&quot; recently, it&apos;s of particular theoretical note that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; possible to write 5-limit &quot;tonal&quot; music, distinguishing between major<br/>&gt; and minor and all that, in 9-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always thought that it&apos;s likely that there&apos;d be a place for<br/>&gt; &quot;novelty&quot; tunings in terms of how this stuff is marketed to the<br/>&gt; public. The general idea around here is that progress is attained by<br/>&gt; moving to higher-numbered EDOs like 19, 22, 31, etc, so as to attain<br/>&gt; greater harmonic accuracy. But I&apos;ve always thought it might be<br/>&gt; possible for the general public&apos;s first foray into microtonality to be<br/>&gt; in the form of something like 7-equal, because it&apos;s actually simpler<br/>&gt; to think of (zero learning curve), has a certain &quot;charm&quot; to it, and<br/>&gt; sounds xenharmonic right off the bat. It&apos;s a good way to wean folks<br/>&gt; off of 12 because it&apos;s easy, just for fun, and immediately sounds<br/>&gt; different. But now I think that 9-EDO would be more likely to catch on<br/>&gt; than 7, because 9 actually distinguishes between major and minor<br/>&gt; chords and supports tonal harmony. You obviously aren&apos;t going to want<br/>&gt; to choose 9-EDO if you&apos;re looking for a near-optimal tuning for<br/>&gt; mavila, but if you&apos;re playing on a flute or kalimba or something you<br/>&gt; might actually like 9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div>
