I know, you&apos;ve got to take the good with<br/>the bad! But it still makes me sick. The result of the PFP dynamic,<br/>what it brings out in 99.9% of the folks who call <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> home, that<br/>is a foul, foul thing.</p><p>Alright, I&apos;ll shut up now.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=12292 href="#12292">ðŸ”—</a>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2000 6:45:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p>and at it&apos;s best I see it as a<br/>&gt; potential forum somewhat akin to the old &quot;hometaper&quot; scene that<br/>setup<br/>&gt; camp at Option magazine way back in the early &apos;80s...</p><p>Dan,</p><p>I think your right about this. There is no filtering of the content<br/>on MP3. It&apos;s all about making tons of dough - that&apos;s why anyone with<br/>the ability to push the button an mp3 encoder can put their music out<br/>there. <a href="http://MP3.COM">MP3.COM</a> makes their money from being able to advertise to you<br/>when you visit - so they definately have a big business reason for<br/>making it this kind of &quot;all inclusive&quot; thing. What&apos;s really cool to<br/>me is how the microtonalists are using the service for their own<br/>designs! Man, we need the exposure - what a great contrast it<br/>provides to the hum drum content out there!

I have never<br/>actually paid ANYTHING to <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>.  The service is ENTIRELY FREE...<br/>unless, that is, you object to the little banners on the Web pages.<br/>They don&apos;t even FLASH or anything...  They do also send a few<br/>e-mails... but I have not found it all that intrusive... certainly<br/>they send fewer of them than something like &quot;PC Magazine.&quot;</p><p>The only thing a person has to be careful of is the copyrights... one<br/>should hold the copyright of the material up there... or get<br/>permission from one&apos;s publishers if they don&apos;t know about it&apos;s<br/>availability on the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> website.  Then, of course, they will want<br/>a &quot;cut&quot; of it, like on a regular &quot;physical&quot; record.</p><p>You can also MAKE money on the public visits to the Website.  I have<br/>made an impressive $1.50 through last months&apos; visits, and I&apos;m hoping<br/>this impressive streak will continue :).  With the DAM-- CDs... now<br/>for this the publishers would CERTAINLY have to be appraised, <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a><br/>assembles a CD from several of your tracks and sells it.  People can,<br/>and do, make good money on this.</p><p>Check out Jeff Harrington... he has made THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS from<br/>his website.  I&apos;m not certain how he does it... but he has &quot;radio<br/>stations&quot; all over the place.</p><p>Surely that would not be considered &quot;PFP&quot; in my humble opinion...</p><p>AND WHAT&apos;S MORE... look what John Starrett has done with his<br/>alternate tuning Tuning Punks site.  It seems as though YOU have<br/>benefited more from this than just about anybody.  I would have no<br/>knowledge of your interesting works if it weren&apos;t for the TUNING<br/>PUNKS.... After all, you seem to have more pieces up there than just<br/>about anybody! :) :)</p><p>If <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> is so bad, then I would like to know ANOTHER site that<br/>enables people to host music in as wide and efficient a way...<br/>BESIDES, <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> is an entirely, legitimate alternative to the big<br/>monopolistic recording concerns... even the small monopolistic<br/>recording concerns... That&apos;s why they ran after <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> with such a<br/>vengence in the recent litigation... which I&apos;m certain you have been<br/>following.</p><p>I admit, I don&apos;t just browse through the pages at random... usually<br/>the links have something that pertain to something I am interested<br/>in... but given THAT caveat, the quality has been surprisingly<br/>high...</p><p>At least that has been my experience...<br/>_________________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=12298 href="#12298">ðŸ”—</a>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2000 9:19:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/> the quality has been surprisingly<br/>&gt; high...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least that has been my experience...<br/>&gt; _________________ _____ __ __ _<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>It is noteworthy that there is allot of fine East Indian Classical<br/>music to be found out on <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>.
