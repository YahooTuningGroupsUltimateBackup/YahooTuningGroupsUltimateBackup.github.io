Here&apos;s the clip I&apos;m<br/>talking about:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3G7VW1RMks&t=1m57s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3G7VW1RMks&t=1m57s</a></p><p>Go to 1:57 if it doesn&apos;t automatically load. My reasoning is that he&apos;s<br/>playing something like C Dv Eb E, but that the Eb is a bit flat to be<br/>the 7/4 over F, so it&apos;s more like 7/6 than 6/5. The Dv seems to bisect<br/>them, which would suggest 7-limit negri. So here&apos;s the results:</p><p>Spectrogram: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/bashirspecgram.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/bashirspecgram.png</a><br/>Wave file: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/negri2.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/negri2.wav</a></p><p>I did the spectrogram analysis at the second harmonic which was the<br/>strongest in the signal. The melody line is something like C Dv C Dv,<br/>Dv Eb Dv Eb, Eb E Eb E - what I&apos;m claiming is negri tempered. I used a<br/>4096-point Kaiser window for the spectrogram, which means that we&apos;re<br/>getting better frequency resolution at the cost of crappier time<br/>resolution. This is why it looks like the note onsets are all smeared<br/>on top of one another.</p><p>Results - The first note C is played at roughly 530 Hz; then it moves<br/>to 572 Hz for Dv. Bashir then starts the Dv at a few Hz higher, 574<br/>Hz, and then moves to Eb at 618 Hz. He then starts the Eb a few Hz<br/>higher at 624 Hz, and then moves to 662 Hz. Although it sounds like<br/>he&apos;s going to then go to F, he never does, because that&apos;s the key the<br/>song is in and he&apos;s teasing you.</p><p>So let&apos;s work this out:</p><p>Freqs  - Cents   - Diffs From Previous Mean - Diffs From Previous Note<br/> 530       0.0       0.0                        0.0</p><p> 572     132.027                              132.027<br/>(573)   (135.049)  135.049<br/> 574     138.070                                6.043</p><p> 618     265.937                              127.867<br/> 620     271.531<br/>(621)   (274.301)  139.252<br/> 624     282.664                               16.727</p><p> 662     385.007   110.706                    102.343</p><p>This turns outFreqs  - Cents   - Diffs From Previous Mean - Diffs From<br/>Previous Note<br/> 530       0.0       0.0                        0.0</p><p> 572     132.027                              132.027<br/>(573)   (135.049)  135.049<br/> 574     138.070                                6.043</p><p> 618     265.937                              127.867<br/> 620     271.531<br/>(621)   (274.301)  139.252<br/> 624     282.664                               16.727</p><p> 662     385.007   110.706                    102.343</p><p>Whether or not you want to call this a &quot;negri well-temperament&quot; I<br/>leave up to you.

There is no<br/>possible way that it can be phase-invariant if it&apos;s picking peaks from<br/>the square of its autocorrelation, if you think back to how the phase<br/>response of each note altered the time-domain waveform of the signal<br/>when we were looking into periodicity buzz. This algorithm is not<br/>perfect and will introduce artifacts into the signal.</p><p>On the other hand, a spectrogram is a short-time Fourier transform,<br/>which is a linear, reversible, deterministic algorithm that means you<br/>chop the signal into little blocks and just take an FFT of it. It is a<br/>linear operation that doesn&apos;t attempt to perform any type of feature<br/>extraction on the signal it all, and hence no additional artifacts are<br/>introduced into the signal. It doesn&apos;t assume anything about the<br/>signal being monocomponent or do any &quot;phantom fundamental&quot; periodicity<br/>processing. The tradeoff is that you have to figure out what the<br/>fundamental at any moment is yourself. This is not a problem because<br/>we&apos;re dealing with a harmonic signal.</p><p>The other tradeoff is that there is no &quot;perfect&quot; time/frequency plot;<br/>you gain more time resolution at the cost of less frequency resolution<br/>and vice versa. In this case, the time resolution is less important<br/>than the frequency resolution, so I chose a window that&apos;s known for<br/>being tight in the frequency domain and a larger window size. Vibrato<br/>gets smeared out a bit such that the center frequency dominates.</p><p>In light of that, how on earth are you going to make the argument that<br/>the Tartini algorithm is somehow more accurate, for this specific<br/>purpose, than an actual STFT?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; And Melodyne<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/temp/Melodyne.png">http://lumma.org/temp/Melodyne.png</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Melodyne gives the first phrase as:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bb+1, C-2, Eb-16 Eb-2, Db+55 Db+50 Db+57, Eb-27 Eb+8,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Db+55 Db+52 Db+50, Eb-34 Eb+6, Db+56 Db+56 Db+60, Eb-30 Eb-2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, what scale is this?

I think that the cochlea splits the signal<br/>into a number of different time-domain signals which are all then sent<br/>to the brain. I think that the brain then performs some kind of<br/>periodicity analysis on it. I think that the type of periodicity<br/>analysis that it&apos;s doing is probably related to all of the<br/>combination-sensitive neuron stuff that we&apos;ve talked about before.

Of course not.* However, that doesn&apos;t mean<br/>that the frequency domain still isn&apos;t involved, nor does it mean that<br/>it isn&apos;t involved in the cochlea which is also not performing a<br/>Fourier transform on the signal. This is because the frequency domain<br/>and the time domain are really the same thing, in a certain sense.</p><p>If you&apos;re filtering a signal in the frequency domain, that means that<br/>you&apos;re multiplying the frequency response of the signal by the<br/>frequency response of the filter. There are two ways to do this which<br/>are mathematically equivalent:</p><p>1) Take the Fourier transform of the signal, take the Fourier<br/>transform of the filter, multiply the two together, and then take the<br/>inverse Fourier transform of the resultant spectrum, producing the<br/>filtered signal<br/>2) Take the incoming time-domain signal and in real time convolve it<br/>with the impulse response of the filter in the time domain, producing<br/>the filtered signal</p><p>Both the cochlea and the combination-sensitive neurons in the brain<br/>are doing number 2 directly,** which is actually the same thing as<br/>number 1 indirectly anyway.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is equivalent to saying that the field of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attraction for 5/4 is much smaller for a melodic interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than a harmonic interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s equivalent to saying fields of attraction aren&apos;t the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; One True Force Governing All Music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you please say whatever point it is you&apos;re trying to make<br/>&gt; &gt; in clear, concise English?

I also fail to see why you&apos;re blowing this issue up out of<br/>the context that I posted it in. I said that it sounded like Munir<br/>Bashir had evened out the steps in a tiny fragment in an improvisation<br/>played on a fretless instrument. I informally referred to this pattern<br/>as &quot;Negri&quot; on Facebook, where I got in a tangential discussion with<br/>Paul over the rigor of using that terminology. I never claimed that<br/>maqam music was &quot;negri tempered&quot; or that negri plays any part in its<br/>structure. I claimed, initially, that as a one-off incident in an<br/>improvisation, it sounded like a pattern of steps was occurring that I<br/>related to the negri 9-note MOS.</p><p>In fact, I never even claimed that it actually was negri tempered,<br/>just that it sounded like that to me, subjectively, on the recording.<br/>If you really want me to be accurate, the whole point of that<br/>discussion was &quot;Hey Igs look, this sounds like &apos;negri hearing&apos; instead<br/>of &apos;diatonic hearing!&apos;&quot; And when I can figure out how to use Tartini<br/>we&apos;ll see how good my ears are. Maybe you really are golden ears here,<br/>and all of the infamous AP stuff I can pull in real life only works in<br/>12-tet, kind of how like chess players apparently have trouble keeping<br/>track of a game played mentally if the pieces are set up in an<br/>impossible position.</p><p>This is all a side discussion. The present discussion is about whether<br/>or not you can map intervals in maqam music to 5 and 11. You claim<br/>that we can&apos;t since they&apos;re used as melodic intervals, and hence the<br/>usual periodicity analysis isn&apos;t taking place, so it&apos;s inappropriate<br/>to map 400 cents to 5/4. The undercurrent here is the same<br/>disagreement we&apos;ve had in every major discussion in the past year,<br/>which is whether or not HE applies to melodic processing.</p><p>This is why all of the stuff is related on minorness. This is also why<br/>my &quot;very dead simple picture&quot; of the linear temperaments suggested is<br/>a viable springboard onto further research. Claiming that it&apos;s not<br/>accurate enough, or that intervals are being mapped inconsistently, or<br/>something like that, would be a good criticism of those temperaments.<br/>Claiming that mapping to primes is an invalid procedure for monophonic<br/>music is the focus of the present conversation.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97010 href="#97010">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2011 3:23:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, Mar 13, 2011 at 5:03 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I see you&apos;re starting the ridiculous strawman phase of the discussion<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; now.

I have said very<br/>clearly that I thought he was inspired in the middle of his<br/>improvisation to do so, and that it has nothing to do with the<br/>fundamental underpinnings of maqam structure. In fact, I also said<br/>that this was just the categorical perception I had of the phrase, and<br/>that it may well be closer to 0-150-300-400.

Trained<br/>&gt; recognition of quantitative values with naive perception<br/>&gt; of qualia. Just for starters.</p><p>&gt; The scales are tetrachordal, which certainly suggests a role<br/>&gt; for 3:2. I don&apos;t know of any 5:4-period scales among the<br/>&gt; maqamat - do you?</p><p>Which, after I sent out some 5/4-period ajnas, you raised the goalpost<br/>and said that although the period here is 400 cents, that that doesn&apos;t<br/>count as the period being &quot;5/4,&quot; for some mysterious reason.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;d think if they were keen<br/>&gt; on evoking a &apos;melodic form of periodicity detection&apos; we would<br/>&gt; hear examples of them playing things like C E C E C E<br/>&gt; instead of C C&apos; C C&apos;...</p><p>etc. I spent a lot of time trying to write detailed analyses of what I<br/>understand our two paradigms to be, what the difference between them<br/>is, and how I think we can figure out which is more accurate with an<br/>actual listening test.
