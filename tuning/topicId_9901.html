According to<br/>this procedure, each succesive half-step is obtained by positioning a<br/>fret at one-eighteenth of the remaining length of the string. This<br/>produced a ratio of frequencies of 1.0588, which is a reasonable<br/>approx. to the equal-tempered half-step, 1.0595. More accurately,<br/>guitar builders today have used to string length divided by 17.835 to<br/>locate a proper half-step. This is fine if you are satisfied with the<br/>12 tone equal tempered system. I seek to cut a fretboard that will<br/>play exact harmonies. This will limit the instruments ability to play<br/>in one key, but extremely well. I have frequencies on paper, but I<br/>need to know where to place my frets. For example, the first fret<br/>ratio would be 1.05. I need to know what I must divide my string<br/>length by in order to obtain this ratio. The ratio&apos;s along the neck<br/>will differ. If anyone has information, or leads on where I could<br/>read information on this topic, I would be happy. I&apos;m in dire straits<br/>here.</p></div><h3><a id=10203 href="#10203">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/25/2000 3:02:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:8gi3jh+8bca@eGroups.com">8gi3jh+8bca@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>The Venus wrote:</p><p>&gt; Since I&apos;m taking the time to cut a fretboard to play pure just<br/>&gt; harmonies, my dilemna now is intonation. Before I go ahead, purchase<br/>&gt; a blank fretboard, and bring out the hacksaw ...</p><p>I suggest you buy a fretsaw as well.  I&apos;m not sure exactly what they are<br/>or how much they cost, but cutting the slots with a standard carpentry saw<br/>did give me trouble.  The frets slid in easily enough, but then had to be<br/>glued in place, and didn&apos;t all stick the same way, amongst other problems.</p><p>         Graham</p></div>
