And, as one who has taught blues/country/jazz to hundreds of students over the years, I can&apos;t think of a better way of teaching these arts than by passing the melodies/riffs over to the student by a lot of repetition. Then, of course, I tell my students to DO something with those phrases to make them their own...for any art to survive, it must take the best from so called tradition, and morph it into the living experiences of each individual. For example, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Hendrix and others took the blues of BB King, T Bone Walker, Howlin Wolf and those older masters, and made it into something contemporary by recasting what they took from them into their own vision...and from that came a whole new genre of rock/blues music, and I still hear echoes of those guys in today&apos;s guitar players...who are still reshaping THOSE maestros into yet more contemporary concepts...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>   <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=69533 href="#69533">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 3:21:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; And, as one who has taught blues/country/jazz to hundreds of<br/>&gt; students over the years,</p><p>Speaking as one who as read hundreds of your posts over the<br/>years, I wish you wouldn&apos;t now start every post with a statement<br/>like this.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
