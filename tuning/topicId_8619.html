It&apos;s adaptive JI using the 5:9<br/>&gt; instead of the 4:7. Instead of a single syntonic comma shift between F and<br/>&gt; G7 we&apos;ve spread it over the 3 transitions. This is equivalent to having the<br/>&gt; roots in 1/3-comma meantone with vertical JI. I expect 5[4:5:6|5:6]9 would<br/>&gt; be a lot easier to sing a cappella than 9[4:5:6|27:32]16 (because all but<br/>&gt; one of its 6 intervals can &quot;lock in&quot; and the 6th one is far enough away<br/>&gt; from anything simple that it will have no &quot;pull&quot; in any particular<br/>&gt; direction),</p><p>That worries me. &quot;My&quot; tritones leave no doubt about the direction of &quot;pull.&quot;</p><p>&gt; and I expect it will sound more natural in a diatonic context<br/>&gt; than 4:5:6:7. Maybe this is the one that can satisfy both Dave and Jerry?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F        4/3  27/20<br/>&gt; E  5/4               5/4<br/>&gt; D              9/8<br/>&gt; C  1/1   1/1         1/1<br/>&gt; B             15/8<br/>&gt; A        5/3<br/>&gt; G  3/2         3/2   3/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          all   all<br/>&gt;         +7.2c -7.2c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would have been nice to give Jerry just this one and the adaptive<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7 &quot;barbershop&quot; one in a blind test to see which he preferred, and<br/>&gt; which he thought his singers were (or should be) closest to.</p><p>If you&apos;re willing, Monz, I&apos;m willing. (I did find the Digest that contained<br/>your MIDI post, but as before I&apos;m having trouble opening it. I&apos;ll keep<br/>trying. I have to call Earthlink to find out why the mp3 I posted on my site<br/>won&apos;t &quot;come down.&quot; I&apos;ll ask about my difficulty opening MIDI files, too.)</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
