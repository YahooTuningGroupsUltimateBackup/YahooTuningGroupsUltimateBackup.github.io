I downloaded a demo copy of one called &quot;composer&quot; from<br/><a href="http://www.akoff.com">http://www.akoff.com</a><br/>and the examples they show of .wav files of piano, guitar, voice and<br/>whistling and their midi equivalents is pretty impressive. Pitchbends<br/>galore do reflect the vocal and whistling inflections.<br/>Unfortunately, my computer that runs win95 doesn&apos;t have a synth in it and<br/>the program is recommended for machines with a minimum of 150MHZ speed;<br/>mine&apos;s 133. Anyway, I couldn&apos;t save the conversions without registering it,<br/>so unless I can determine in what disguise the conversion exists in the<br/>demo version, I can&apos;t capture it to run on my machine that _does have MIDI<br/>capabilities.<br/>Thanks for input. At the very least, I should think such a program could<br/>produce some pretty bizarre stuff.</p></div>
