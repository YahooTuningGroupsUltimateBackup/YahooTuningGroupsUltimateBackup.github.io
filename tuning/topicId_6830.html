Csound enabled me (a la nancarow) to realize high<br/>primes and lightning fast accuracies  that i could hear in my head but not get<br/>the ensemble to construe correctly. We would have free-form JI improvisation 2-3<br/>times a week and maybe 1- 20 minute segment out of say 6-10 hours would be<br/>something i felt as musical director at that point should be explored.<br/>&quot;musicians&quot; would come into the environment usually a sine environment either<br/>using the 17 at 272hz or some other pitch maybe an undertone 3/7&lt;14/13 or what<br/>have you and would resort to a musicians mentality with all the useless...Am i<br/>loud enough? when can i solo? poop<br/>i think the other point for &quot;composers&quot; of Electroacoutic,interactive,<br/>acousmatic or whatever is to trust your own beliefs and as someone said earlier<br/>regarding bartok ----Do not remove yr microtones for Sir yehudi------<br/>who ended up playing what Shankar told him anyway :-)</p><p>I won&apos;t make a difference now that they have made music illegal anyways</p></div>
