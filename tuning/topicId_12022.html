Few tones to play with.<br/>I have some questions for everybody out there kind enough to share his<br/>knowledge.I need some direction(Books,web sites etc).<br/>My questions are:<br/>a)Which instruments are more practical to play alternate tunings on?<br/>I am willing to learn a new instrument.I especially like brass instruments.<br/>b)Can brass instruments  play microtones?(I would apreciate some info<br/>about how).<br/>c)I like analog synths.What controlers can I use to play tunings like<br/>24 or 31 tone? I find interesting the continuum fingerboard ,but I can&apos;t<br/>find info on that.<br/>Thank you all<br/>Alex P.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>.</p><p>Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at <a href="http://profiles.msn.com">http://profiles.msn.com</a>.</p></div><h3><a id=12029 href="#12029">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2000 1:49:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Alexandros Papadopoulos&quot; &lt;alexmoog@h...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12022">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12022</a></p><p>&gt; Hello<br/>&gt; I am Alex P. from Greece</p><p>&gt; a)Which instruments are more practical to play alternate tunings on?<br/>&gt; I am willing to learn a new instrument.I especially like brass<br/>instruments.<br/>&gt; b)Can brass instruments  play microtones?(I would apreciate some<br/>info about how).</p><p>Since brass instruments are based on the overtone series, they can<br/>play &quot;microtones&quot; readily... since there is a whole series of &quot;just&quot;<br/>pitches set up from the fundamental of each position.  The only<br/>problem is the fact that the performers learn NOT to play some of<br/>these pitches.</p><p>I was fortunate in working with noted horn player, Francis Orval, now<br/>living in Europe.  He became interested in microtones after<br/>performing Henri Pousseur&apos;s solo piece in just intonation.  Orval<br/>created a chart with ALL the harmonics from all the positions, not<br/>only the ones close to 12-tET, which the players customarily use.</p><p>I wrote two pieces for him in just intonation... one for two horns<br/>and a more virtuosic one for solo horn in just intonation, which<br/>Orval premiered at Merkin Hall in New York.</p><p>If you are interested in this piece, it is available as a circulating<br/>score at the New York Public Library, or you can order it through:</p><p><a href="http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/">http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/</a></p><p>Just search my name, Joseph Pehrson</p><p>Although I have not written for it in a microtonal capacity, the<br/>trombone would be even more flexible, since the fundamental can be<br/>altered continuously, with all the accompanying just overtone series.</p><p>Brass players, by the way, tend to be more interested in alternate<br/>tunings than some other instrumentalists... so there can be more of a<br/>rapport...<br/>_____________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=12051 href="#12051">ðŸ”—</a>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>8/29/2000 9:32:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Alexandros Papadopoulos&quot; &lt;alexmoog@h...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; a)Which instruments are more practical to play alternate tunings on?</p><p>I can&apos;t improve on the many excellent responses.

There are some interesting and worthwhile tunings with as few as 5 tones per octave.  Seven is plenty.  The problem is only that Western musicians have largely forgotten that there is also music outside the 12t-ET frame of reference.</p><p>By the way, judging from your post, it seems that they teach English better in Greece than in America these days.  :-)</p><p>--<br/>David J.
