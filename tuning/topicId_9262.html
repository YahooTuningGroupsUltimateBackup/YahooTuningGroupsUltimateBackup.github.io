To notate this I&apos;ve used a pretty<br/>much self-explanatory ASCII adaptation where the numbers correspond to<br/>the equal division of the octave, though only C&apos; through C&quot; are<br/>notated 0 through 20, so an A3 for example -- a 15/20ths of an octave<br/>at 900&iuml;&iquest;&half; -- would be notated as a -5... and an Eb5 -- 5/20ths of an<br/>octave at 300&iuml;&iquest;&half; -- would be notated as a 25 (etc.). The part is simple<br/>enough that I think it can support this somewhat awkward use of<br/>numbers less than zero and greater than twenty without taking on yet<br/>another off-putting notational encumbrance.</p><p>INTERTWINED IN THE COSMIC ADVENTURE --</p><p>I&apos;ve often referred to Charles Ives as a sort of Sigurd Olson of<br/>music. This is how David Backes ends his wonderful article on Olson,<br/>&quot;The Land Beyond the Rim: Sigurd Olson&apos;s Wilderness Theology&quot;:</p><p>Olson&apos;s wilderness theology was, in essence, a sacramental vision of<br/>life and of evolution itself. If the whole of earth and the universe<br/>beyond is an extension of God, then humans are obliged to love all<br/>life, human and nonhuman, because all life is intertwined in the<br/>cosmic adventure. Olson&apos;s argument for wilderness preservation focused<br/>primarily on the human psychological and spiritual benefits, but he<br/>believed that these individual benefits would, in turn, lead to a more<br/>biocentric perspective. In wilderness we could rediscover the<br/>timeless, creative force of the universe, regain a sense of being part<br/>of that force, and, in so doing, glimpse &quot;the land beyond the rim.&quot;<br/>With such an experience, it would be impossible to maintain a purely<br/>anthropocentric world view. To Olson, this was reason enough for<br/>preserving wilderness. &quot;No longer can [wilderness] be saved from the<br/>standpoint of physical enjoyment but only as a stepping stone to<br/>cosmic understanding,&quot; he wrote in 1966. &quot;In a world confused and<br/>strident, a world where all the old verities are being questioned,<br/>this is the final answer.&quot;</p><p>Rather than trying to recreate, or mimic the gentle, timeless quality<br/>of Ives two serenity chords -- b4 f5 a5 c6, and c#4 g5 b5 e6 -- I&apos;ve<br/>instead opted to try and recast their mood and shape in a way that<br/>tends to reflect some of my own feelings for this piece. And a lot of<br/>my approach to arranging Ives is influenced and colored by my feelings<br/>about Ives and Olson - the similar exalted, heartfelt threads that run<br/>through them. When Olson wrote, &quot;no longer can wilderness be saved<br/>from the standpoint of physical enjoyment but only as a stepping stone<br/>to cosmic understanding,&quot; he was expressing an ideal exactly<br/>analogous -- and certainly no less doomed to failure and ridicule --<br/>than Ives visions of music and humanity&apos;s great anagogic potential.</p><p>In his Ives biography _A Life With Music_, Jan Swafford wrote this of<br/>&quot;Serenity&quot;: &quot;Over a quite, slow-cycling chordal ostinato that seems to<br/>stop time in its course, the voice chants John Greenleaf Whittier&apos;s<br/>prayer for inner peace, which is surely Ives&apos;s prayer as well.&quot;</p><p>O, Sabbath rest of Galilee!<br/>O, calm of hills above,<br/>Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee<br/>the silence of eternity<br/>Interpreted by love</p><p>Drop thy still dews of quietness,<br/>till all our strivings cease;<br/>Take from our souls the strain and stress,<br/>And let our ordered lives confess,<br/>The beauty of Thy peace.</p><p>Sigurd Olson died while snowshoeing near his home in Ely, Minnesota,<br/>in January of 1982. Olson&apos;s son Robert wrote about his father&apos;s death<br/>in an introduction to _The Collected Works of Sigurd F. Olson: The<br/>Early Writings: 1921-1934_. He closes the introduction with these<br/>thoughts: &quot;He died literally with his boots on, on a cold January day,<br/>snowshoeing his favorite trail around the bog behind the house. The<br/>usual arrangements followed. But I wished we could have left him<br/>there, let the snow fall to cover him until he was only a mound<br/>beneath. We should have let nature have its way with his remains, to<br/>break him down into the soil of the forest. His body would have joined<br/>his spirit in the flow of life that had nourished him for over 80<br/>years. In the fall, his shroud would have been a blanket of autumn<br/>leaves, his anthem the far calling of strings of geese heading south,<br/>the low organ tones of the winter winds. It would have been fitting, I<br/>think, and a far, far better thing.&quot;</p><p>SERENITY<br/>Charles Ives -- [arrangement, D.
