The TM basis is {64/63, 729/686}, another<br/>&gt; &gt; important comma is the Pythagorean comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Questions: (1) What is meant by &quot;12-et compatible&quot;?</p><p>Gene means that these commas vanish in 12-equal. If you try to<br/>construct these intervals in 12-equal, using 12-equal&apos;s best<br/>approximations to the consonant intervals that make them up in JI,<br/>you get a unison in each case.</p><p>Let&apos;s make this precise, since I think you&apos;re a physicist. The below<br/>is the sort of material you see on tuning-math, but since I think<br/>you&apos;re new, I&apos;ll break the &quot;rule&quot; and post it here.</p><p>Firstly, 12-equal is consistent in the 7-limit. Knowing that, it&apos;s<br/>pretty unobjectionable to write the covector for the 12-equal pitch<br/>contours as</p><p>&lt;12 19 28 34]</p><p>(If anyone hasn&apos;t read my new paper -- which I&apos;m snail-mailing out to<br/>everyone for free -- just note that this is how 12-equal approximates<br/>primes 2, 3, 5, and 7, in steps of 12-equa).</p><p>Now 64/63 can be written as 2^6 * 3^(-2) * 5^0 * 7^(-1), or as a<br/>vector in the JI lattice,</p><p>[6 -2 0 -1&gt;</p><p>To calculate its represenation in 12-equal, just take the bracket<br/>product of this with the covector above:</p><p>&lt;12 19 28 34|6 -2 0 -1&gt;</p><p>= 12*6 - 19*2 - 34</p><p>= 0.</p><p>So 64/63 vanishes in 12-equal.</p><p>729/686 can be written as 2^(-1) * 3^6 * 5^0 * 7^(-3), or</p><p>[-1 6 0 -3&gt;.</p><p>So, as above, we compute</p><p>&lt;12 19 28 34|-1 6 0 -3&gt;</p><p>= -12 + 19*6 - 3*34</p><p>= 0.</p><p>So 729/686 vanishes in 12-equal too.</p><p>&gt; (2) How does one<br/>&gt; arrive at a list of such commas?</p><p>Brute force works -- create an array containing a large chunk of the<br/>lattice, and compute the bracket product of each vector in this array<br/>with the 12-equal covector. Look for where the result is zero -- the<br/>corresponding vectors are commas that vanish in 12-equal. The set of<br/>positions where a zero occurs -- called the kernel -- will form a<br/>sublattice of your original lattice.</p><p>So another, quicker, way is to construct a lattice basis for the<br/>kernel of 12-equal, and then flesh out the resulting lattice. The key<br/>here is finding a valid lattice basis for the kernel. Any old<br/>linearly independent set of vectors representing commas that vanish<br/>in 12-equal won&apos;t necessarily do the trick, because it may only<br/>generate a sublattice of the kernel lattice. In that case, the wedge<br/>product of the linearly independent set of vectors will result in an<br/>integer multiple of the 12-equal covector. What you need is a set<br/>whose wedge product is exactly the 12-equal covector.</p><p>Let&apos;s ignore prime 5 and just consider primes 2, 3, and 7. These<br/>generate a three-dimensional tuning system. So we will need two<br/>independent vanishing commas to end up with the one-dimensional<br/>system that is 12-equal. We already know that 64/63 works as one,<br/>since</p><p>&lt;12 19 28 34|6 -2 0 -1&gt; = 0.</p><p>Since we&apos;re ignoring prime 5, we can just write this as</p><p>&lt;12 19 34|6 -2 -1&gt; = 0.</p><p>Similarly, 729/686 works as one, since</p><p>&lt;12 19 34|-1 6 -3&gt; = 0</p><p>To test whether these two serve as a basis for the full 12-equal<br/>kernel lattice, and not just a subset, calculate the wedge product<br/>and take its complement. In this, three-dimensional, case, another<br/>word for this is &quot;taking the cross-product&quot;, which operation should<br/>be familiar to physicists. The result is</p><p>[6 -2 -1&gt; X [-1 6 -3&gt; = &lt;12 19 34]</p><p>So indeed we&apos;ve found a basis for 12-equal&apos;s kernel lattice.<br/>Therefore, the entire infinite set of commas in {2,3,7}-JI -- that<br/>is, JI built from the primes 2, 3, and 7 -- which vanish in 12-equal<br/>can be constructed using two integer parameters, a and b, which both<br/>vary across all integers, and calculating</p><p>a*[6 -2 -1&gt; + b*[-1 6 -3&gt;</p><p>In practice, running each a and b independently from, say, -50 to 50<br/>will more than suffice. This will give you the list you were looking<br/>for.</p><p>More later -- and should we stay at this level of mathematics,<br/>perhaps we should move it to tuning-math (sorry for the repeated<br/>moving requests :) ).</p></div>
