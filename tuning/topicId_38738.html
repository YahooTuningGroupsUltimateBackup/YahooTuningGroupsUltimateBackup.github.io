So it is essentially 7-tone ET in my<br/>understanding.</p><p>This is not based on any textual authority, however. It so happens my<br/>wife is Argentine and I have musicians, one professional who played<br/>with both Astor Piazzola and Gato Barbieri at different times, among<br/>my Argentine in-laws. I own a couple of quenas hand-made for me by a<br/>famous quenista and recordings of Andean music, which I dearly love.<br/>I have been to Argentina many times and speak the language almost on<br/>a par with an educated native.</p><p>However, and this is a BIG however, the way most Andean music is<br/>played today (&quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;, recorded by Simon and Garfunkle using<br/>two Argentine quenistas or quena players in the studio, is a typical<br/>example) the pitches are BENT by the players to go with 12-ET guitars<br/>and charangos (ukelele-type instruments with gut double strings about<br/>the same size as a mandolin with an armadillo shell as the body and a<br/>wooden belly glued onto it). I have no clue as to how they tune<br/>zamponas these days (sometimes also called &quot;panpipas incaicas&quot; or<br/>Incan panpipes).</p><p>Strangely, they still make the quena holes equidistant and you can<br/>hear that bias often in the melodies. I guess this allows them to<br/>bend to any key, since the difference between whole- and half-steps<br/>is created by the player. The Andean melodies, like &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;<br/>tend to be pentatonic modes of one kind or another. By that I mean<br/>like CDEGA, and its modal rotations. With the slight 7-tET bias often<br/>evident in the tuning, it creates an rather unique melodic flavor<br/>that is quite haunting.</p><p>What is now known in Argentina as &quot;Andean&quot; music is actually European-<br/>influenced Incan- and-other-indigenous-people-inpsired melodies over<br/>12-ET harmonies and a lot of Latin rhythmic influence. It is a little<br/>like some of our Afro-American traditions such as the blues in its<br/>mixed but authentic folk evolution.</p><p>There are a few bands in the Andes, however, who, in addition to<br/>playing this more common Andean music, still throw in some older,<br/>purer Incan and other indigenous music. It is powerful stuff, but not<br/>harmonic. It is melodic-rhythmic and uses very different melodic<br/>techniques, warbling, glissing, unusual trill-like ornaments<br/>and &quot;yodeling&quot; sounds on the quenas, etc. and other very &quot;strange&quot;<br/>but wonderful stuff.</p><p>Hope this helps shed some light.</p><p>Cheers to all! Been very busy with our own musical and other vital<br/>endeavors here locally.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Bob</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2002 4:38:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert!<br/>    Equidistant holes produce a subharmonic series. If one hears a whole tone scale it is probably<br/>sub 10-9-8-7 maybe even the 11 on top. the seventh tone is tune to a 3/2 of one of the<br/>subharmonics giving you something to play a 7 tone scale. Erv has spent countless hours measuring<br/>the tunings as well as myself going over there to hear them. Listen to the one in Delusion given<br/>to Harry by Erv. it is not 7 et by any stretch of the imagination. Argentina is a different<br/>musical culture.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Tuning of Andean woodwinds?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Todd!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     Erv wilson has a large collection of flutes from south america<br/>&gt; collected by his brothers among others.
