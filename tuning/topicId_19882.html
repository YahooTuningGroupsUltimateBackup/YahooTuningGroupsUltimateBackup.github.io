I will also happily<br/>cede my half-hearted alternative FAQ on keyboards with 12 pitches to your more<br/>scholarly effort.</p><p>Joseph:</p><p>Yes, I do believe that the tuning of the subsemitones was not fixed beforehand.<br/>There is a similar phenomena in Javanese music, where altered tones, _miring_,<br/>are used in slendro. Some musicians describe them as borrowed from a parallel<br/>pelog scale, or in terms of western minor, but most players don&apos;t speak of them<br/>in fixed terms, they just sing or play them. The coincidence with a parallel<br/>pelog or minor scale is a happy one, and may be useful, but it&apos;s not the origin<br/>of the tones.</p><p>Etc:</p><p>I would like to add just one point about reading Zarlino, or about reading any<br/>theorist, for that matter. Claims to have invented or discovered something in<br/>music theory, for example Zarlino describing his 1/4 comma MT as &quot;new&quot;, appear<br/>all too frequently in the theoretical literature. It is tremendously difficult<br/>to verify such claims, other than to note that it appears to be the first<br/>written record or first uncontroversial record, etc., and to evaluate conpeting<br/>claims with great discretion.</p><p>If the full-time theorists on the list will oblige me for a moment, theorists<br/>are often the musical world&apos;s equivalent of snake oil salesmen (please excuse me<br/>if I keep the following in gender specific terms: &quot;snake oil salesperson&quot; just<br/>doesn&apos;t carry the same sting). Reading Zarlino has often struck me as not unlike<br/>listening to a virtuoso pitchman on a roll. Theorists make their living by<br/>offering practical tools to people who want to make music. Ultimately logic,<br/>practicality, and aesthetic quality will have out over mystification and undue<br/>complication, and questions of precendence will be less meaningful than evidence<br/>of quality. However, the theorist seems inevitably to have the need to dress his<br/>wares with claims of priority and the cloak of a mysterious complexity, that can<br/>only be unravelled by him. For only then can he make his audience curious enough<br/>to put out enough money to buy his book or enroll in his conservatory.</p><p>So, to all, when encountering music theorists, _caveat emptor_, and be warned<br/>that for every Ptolemy or Ervin Wilson, doing honest, solid work with modesty<br/>and generosity, there is also a Schillinger or Russell ready to sell you a piece<br/>of work with tremendous style but questionable utility.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=19887 href="#19887">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/7/2001 10:12:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19882.html#19882">/tuning/topicId_19882.html#19882</a></p><p>&gt; Margo:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your response to Ibo Ortgies makes a lot of sense to me.

It is clear that Margo<br/>Schulter&apos;s article on this subject is really the &quot;ne plus ultra...&quot;<br/>on the topic... I&apos;m glad Robert Walker has already added it to the<br/>FAQ.</p><p>I &quot;take back&quot; ANY reservations I had at one point about the FAQ.  I<br/>have been learning so much in discussing these topics that it is<br/>turning out, already, to be extremely valuable!!!</p><p>Regarding the clausula endings, etc., it seemed from the Schulter<br/>article to be somewhat of a &quot;chicken and the egg&quot; phenominon.  The<br/>advent of the keyboards using &quot;extended&quot; chains of fifths and the<br/>&quot;semitonal&quot; motion seems to be happening concurrently...</p><p>Perhaps it is impossible, or even irrelevant to try to determine<br/>&quot;which came first...&quot;  (??)</p><p>Ms. Schulter makes it clear, though, that these linear PRACTICES<br/>certainly &quot;reinforced&quot; any keyboards or tuning systems that used<br/>&quot;additional&quot; fifths to the original eight....</p><p>I would like to thank both of your for contributing to our (well,<br/>certainly MY) education on this fundamental topic.</p><p>And, surely, it *IS* fundamental... Maybe so &quot;fundamental&quot; as to be<br/>&quot;unsettling...&quot; (??)</p><p>Is that why this is rarely taught in school??  I remember taking at<br/>least TWO courses in Medieval music that never touched on these<br/>details (!!)</p><p>_________ _______ ______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
