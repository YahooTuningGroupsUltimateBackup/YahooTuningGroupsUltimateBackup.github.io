Chris Shaffer did the work<br/>on both of these instruments, and without his enthusiasm and<br/>generosity they&apos;d still exist only in my mindÂ—so THANKS Chris!</p><p>The tenor ukulele is fretted as a maximally even 8-out-of-13 in<br/>thirteen-tone equal temperament. Thirteen-tone equal temperament is<br/>almost exclusively mentioned in tuning theory with a negative<br/>connotation, as a sort of pinnacle of atonality and discordance. But<br/>sometimes things need a different perspective, and trying to compare<br/>12TET and 13TET is really quite counterproductive. There are many<br/>truly beautiful scales and subsets in 13TET, and this 8-out-of-13<br/>contains a wonderful 7-tone scale:</p><p>0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13</p><p>The banjotar retains the standard 12TET fretting but adds 5 just<br/>intonated notes:</p><p>33/32, 7/6, 11/8, 14/9, 7/4</p><p>This gives a 17-tone octave, and this arrangement represents three<br/>separate one-dimensional planes of 3, 7 and 11 limit ratios. It also<br/>rather nicely approximates a 3, 5, 7 and 11-limit grid and the banjo<br/>resonator wonderfully melds the otherness of the new notes to the<br/>standard 12-TET arrangement.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; should anyone be interested,I&apos;ve uploaded pictures of my two new<br/>&gt; microtonal instruments to the photos files</p></div>
