Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2001 8:42:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and to my earlier comments on the very<br/>valuable translations and remarks by Ibo Ortgies concerning guidelines<br/>for vocal intonation in the 18th-century German tradition, I would<br/>like to add a brilliant hypothesis by Paul Erlich concerning the<br/>theory of dieses or commas in this era.</p><p>Although in my initial post I proposed that references to division of<br/>the whole-tone into &quot;nine commas&quot; might draw on the tradition of<br/>15th-century Pythagorean models, or the later Mercator/Kircher model<br/>of 53-tone equal temperament (53-tET), Paul has masterfully suggested<br/>an alternative model of 55-tET.</p><p>In this tuning system, which Paul mentions in connection with the<br/>great Baroque composer Telemann, we have a whole-tone of 9 steps (as<br/>in 53-tET also), but a regular diatonic semitone of 5 steps (rather<br/>than the 4 steps of 53-tET, closely approximating the Pythagorean<br/>limma at 256:243 or ~90.22 cents).</p><p>Thus in 55-tET, the large diatonic semitone of 5/9-tone (~109.09<br/>cents) and the small chromatic semitone of 4/9-tone (~87.27 cents)<br/>differ by a &quot;comma&quot; of 1/9-tone or ~21.82 cents, equal to the diesis<br/>whether defined as the difference between such accidentals as D#-Eb<br/>(Eb higher), or the difference between 12 pure fifths and 7 pure<br/>octaves, or the difference between 3 pure major thirds (~392.72 cents<br/>each) and a pure octave.</p><p>The temperament of the 55-tET fifth is around 3.77 cents, not too far<br/>from 1/6-comma meantone (~3.58 cents), so that this tuning would<br/>nicely fit period sensibilities as reflected by Silbermann&apos;s organs.</p><p>The diatonic semitone of 9/55 octave, at 109 cents, is quite close to<br/>the interval of 16:15 prescribed by Zarlino&apos;s system (~111.73 cents),<br/>while the diesis or comma of 21.82 cents is very close to the syntonic<br/>comma at 81:80 (~21.51 cents). Given the recognition of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>syntonic diatonic as the &quot;modern scale&quot; by authors such as Kirnberger<br/>(1771), this resemblance might be an attractive feature.</p><p>Above all, unlike a Pythagorean or 53-tET model, 55-tET permits the<br/>approximation of 18th-century intonational ideals with a _regular_<br/>meantone tuning scheme: a major second at about 196.36 cents is equal<br/>to two fifths up less an octave, a major third to two such<br/>whole-tones, and so forth.</p><p>In contrast, although similarly regular for a typical 13th-14th<br/>century Gothic setting, a Pythagorean or 53-tET model runs into major<br/>complications if one is seeking major thirds near 5:4 rather than<br/>81:64. While a regular diatonic semitone or limma of 4/9-tone is ideal<br/>for Gothic music, the 55-tET diatonic semitone of 5/9-tone similarly<br/>fits an 18th-century setting.</p><p>After reading Paul&apos;s personal communication to me, and picturing a<br/>student indeed taking as a reference a split-key instrument tuned in<br/>55-tET or its rather close approximation of 1/6-comma meantone, I find<br/>this hypothesis most engaging. Here the diesis is synonymous with<br/>1/9-tone, as the authors suggest, and at the same time can be<br/>demonstrated on a keyboard in a neatly regular meantone temperament.</p><p>One lesson of this discussion, online and offline, may be the<br/>importance of actually known a given period and its tunings as a basis<br/>for interpreting statements such as the theory of &quot;nine commas&quot; in a<br/>whole-tone.</p><p>As a medievalist, I was familiar with the Pythagorean approximation of<br/>nine commas in a tone, but not with the 18th-century model of 55-tET<br/>which Paul very helpfully called to my attention.</p><p>Also, my interest in 16th-century tunings has well accustomed me to<br/>1/4-comma meantone with its diesis of 128:125 (~41.06 cents), about<br/>1/5-tone -- but here the smaller, commalike, diesis of 55-tET or<br/>1/6-comma meantone might be more relevant to 18th-century theory and<br/>practice.</p><p>There is an interesting analogy which one might draw between the<br/>&quot;fifthtone&quot; pair of 29-tET/31-tET, and the &quot;ninthtone&quot; pair of<br/>53-tET/55-tET. While either 29-tET or 31-tET divides the tone into<br/>five equal parts, the former tuning is nicely adapted to a Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic setting (and may approximate one possible interpretation of<br/>the vocal intonation system advocated by Marchettus of Padua, 1318);<br/>the latter to a Renaissance/Manneristic setting (closely approximating<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 31-note meantone cycle of 1555).</p><p>The difference is that 29-tET divides the octave into 5 whole-tones<br/>plus two _small_ diatonic semitones of 2/5-tone, while 31-tET divides<br/>it into 5 whole-tones plus two _large_ diatonic semitones of<br/>3/5-tone. The first division fits Gothic or neo-Gothic polyphony with<br/>its active thirds near 127:100 and 13:11, and the second fits<br/>16th-century style with its restful thirds near 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>Similarly, 53-tET divides the octave into 5 whole-tones plus two small<br/>diatonic semitones of 4/9-tone, and 55-tET into 5 whole-tones plus tow<br/>large diatonic semitones of 5/9-tone.</p><p>The latter division fits the concord/discord scheme of 18th-century<br/>music where thirds are full and stable consonances rather than partial<br/>and unstable ones; at the same time, the milder tempering of the fifth<br/>and the somewhat more compact diatonic semitone vis-a-vis 31-tET (or<br/>the almost identical 1/4-comma meantone) may reflect a difference<br/>between 16th-century and 18th-century styles.</p><p>Since some of the passages translated in this discussion point to<br/>split-key instruments as a standard for correct vocal intonation, a<br/>relevant question might be whether or how often such instruments may<br/>have approximated a shade of meantone near 55-tET or 1/6-comma.</p><p>Incidentally, 2/11-comma meantone (fifths ~3.91 cents narrow) would<br/>also give a close approximation of 55-tET, with a diesis curiously<br/>almost exactly equal to the Pythagorean comma of 23.46 cents<br/>(531441:524288).</p><p>To conclude, I find Paul&apos;s proposal a remarkable synthesis of<br/>theoretical models and documented period practice, with the use of<br/>temperaments of around 1/6-comma or 2/11-comma in split-key<br/>instruments a question inviting more discussion.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/27/2001 9:16:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 3/20/01 11:44:09 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; In this tuning system, which Paul mentions in connection with the<br/>&gt;</p><p>While it is true that Telemann has been described as favoring a 55-tET scale<br/>(for a circular 1/6th comma meantone, no doubt, and by Mark Lindley), I have<br/>written to the tuning list previously that this is likely an error.</p><p>Paul, did have a chance to see that Telemann wrote highly chromatic harmonies<br/>on his deathbed to illustrate his ideas which I obtained in Berlin.
