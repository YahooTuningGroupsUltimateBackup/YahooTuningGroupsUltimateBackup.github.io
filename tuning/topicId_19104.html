I&apos;d call this a subminor major seventh, a different<br/>&gt; chord altogether.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 6/5 3/2 15/8<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The most obvious,one third up and one down from the fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure. Why not?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 6/5 3/2 48/25<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Two thirds down!I_m not sure about how useful this is.Any opinions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Opinion: not useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about 10:12:15:19 or (closer to 12-tET) 16:19:24:30?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I like the way the first (1 7/6 3/2 15/8) sounds though I&apos;m not sure<br/>that all listeners would feel that this settles as a tonic minor. I<br/>didn&apos;t like the obvious 1 6/5 3/2 15/8 on listennings.</p><p>I think Pauls second proposal would have a lot of stability being<br/>a complete otonal series. A version I came up with that also uses<br/>the &apos;psuedo-12tet 19 identities&apos; is  1/1 19/16 3/2 36/19 which<br/>in cents is 0 297 702 1106 vs Pauls 0 297 702 1088.</p><p>For MY useage, I feel that the pun between the &quot;minor third above<br/>the 1/1&quot; being a &quot;major third above the major seventh&quot;, is an<br/>important feature of this chord (part of its buzz).</p><p>This is why I believe  I didn&apos;t like the obvious 1 6/5 3/2 15/8 on<br/>listennings, due to the very wide implied &quot;major third&quot; between<br/>the seventh and third. Your last proposal fixes that, at the cost<br/>of placing a very wide major third above the fifth. I believe this<br/>too would lack the restfulness of a tonic minor.</p><p>Basically, you are revealing the basic problem with just/rational<br/>ways to interpret an augmented triad. A stack of 5/4&apos;s puts a<br/>very wide 428c third on the outside. A single 5/4 leaves 814c<br/>to fit two major thirds into.</p><p>Using this result and my preference that the minor third pun as<br/>&quot;major third above the major seventh&quot;, and assuming that I want<br/>that major third to be 5/4 (and it may very well be preferable to<br/>have it a bit sharper major third than the JI one) then I can<br/>draw up a temperring of this chord at  0 295 702 1109 cents.<br/>This puts the 5/4 between the major seventh and minor third<br/>and splits the minor sixth symmetrically around the perfect fifth.</p><p>The most interesting RI (rational intonation) view of this<br/>chord is as a Pythagorean 1/1 32/27 3/2 243/128 with (in C)<br/>the B&lt;-&gt;Eb diminished fourth is a schismic? major third.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=19119 href="#19119">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
