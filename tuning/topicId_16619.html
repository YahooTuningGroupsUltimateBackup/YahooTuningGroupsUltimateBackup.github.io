Let<br/>&gt; me know what you think - it&apos;s very intriguing.</p><p>Try it! I emailed them a couple years ago about strings - while they<br/>couldn&apos;t help me (strings too short...), Yuta Chapman was helpful and<br/>sympathetic.</p><p>Casually, I think the Stick would solve some of the issues Canright<br/>brings up, since it has a longer scale than guitars (867mm vs. like<br/>610mm) and its idiosyncracies might rule out things like barre chords.</p><p>While on the subject, has anyone heard of a &quot;hamatar&quot;? I had one to fool<br/>around with once, basically two electric guitars nut to nut with long<br/>shared strings; the idea was to play both tangent style so that both<br/>hands could be independent and uncrowded (tho&apos; usually I removed the<br/>capo nut and sounded the wrong lengths). Ouf! I need replacement strings<br/>for that same durned project.</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3><a id=16624 href="#16624">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/2000 12:00:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky Ligon wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt; As one can see, they really make this instrument cater to the 12tET<br/>target market. &gt;&gt;</p><p>What other market is there!

For ex, I<br/>have a Roland JV-1080 and I put a fretless guitar though it with the GK pickup and I can play<br/>any microtonal interval. You have to set the bend range from -12 to +12. That even ables you<br/>to play bends on normal 12 et guitars. You also have to set the interface (Roland GI-10) to<br/>the same bend range. The equipment might have changed a bit since I got mine, but the concept<br/>is the same.</p><p>Also, I have a Chapman Stick. I&apos;ve been thinking about refretting it.

Even the master 12 tET players<br/>that we know have explored microtonality - like Steve Vai - aren&apos;t<br/>doing anything of significance to draw an audience or musical<br/>instrument manufacturers to the cause. It was mentioned by Neil<br/>recently, that it was sad that McLaughlin has walked the 12 tET path<br/>even with his lifetime involvement with Indian music - now this *IS*<br/>indeed strange! Him of all people, to still embrace 12 tET this way<br/>will remain paradoxical to me for all my days.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the mass advent of hip-hop and all the various popular<br/>offshoots<br/>&gt; of dance musics, sonically interesting and challenging sounds became<br/>&gt; the norm. And many guitar based bands followed suit.

Yes,<br/>the stuff with Frank Gambale - and who cares!!!</p><p>But on a microtonal note, I think there can be a compromise that can<br/>get the sounds of microtonality in front of young folks, without<br/>making the kind of lifeless music that Corea made - his mission was<br/>not of a microtonal nature either (and being strapped in 12 tET was<br/>his bain as well). The possibilities of writing music that would have<br/>an appeal to the younger audience, are there to be exploited by the<br/>knowing microtonalist. Why can&apos;t we have more &quot;pop&quot; music with<br/>microtonality involved in its structure, that involves the kind of<br/>groove sensibility, which is so popular today (minimalism from the<br/>classical music world has bled into popular electronica of today)? I<br/>see nothing at all wrong with crossing into these styles, as I know<br/>many here do. Whether or not one&apos;s music can have this kind of appeal<br/>has much to do with the style in which microtonal music is rendered.<br/>I&apos;m all for *ANY STYLES* of microtonal music.</p><p>Before I got my first PC I used to produce lots of very complex<br/>orchestrally oriented music with my stand alone sequencer. I would<br/>form &quot;time chords&quot; by juxtaposing many levels of tempi. This music<br/>was largely like the way I remember reading Elliot Carter describe<br/>his experience of examining Stravinsky&apos;s scores. They are like<br/>scrapbooks with torn out pages, pasted back together in a collage, to<br/>create a &quot;fast cut&quot; style (apparently &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; had this<br/>appearance). This kind of thing is fun and challenging to compose and<br/>listen to, but the reality is - no one cares! But conversely if I<br/>pick up the guitar, and play a solo with a fuzzed out distortion<br/>sound, in front of a 20 year old, then we are friends for life! As<br/>above, it&apos;s all about the delivery - like it or leave it. The<br/>alternative is that microtonality will remain an &quot;underground&quot;<br/>activity as it is today. Perhaps a related question is, how may we<br/>make microtonality &quot;sexy&quot;? May we adorn our Lattice with scantily<br/>clad models to draw attention to our numbers about consonance and<br/>complexity? May we run ads showing guys &quot;picking up chicks&quot; with<br/>microtones? I can see it now! &quot;Hey look Girls! It&apos;s Mr. Microtone! -<br/>I&apos;ll be back to pick you up later baby!&quot;</p><p>May the sexiest microtonalists among us please step forward -<br/>especially if you look good in high-heels!!!  }:  )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once the instruments and the role models and the &quot;thing&quot; is in<br/>&gt; place -- in the stores and on the records and in the videos and<br/>&gt; straight into the great collective consumer/societal consciousness,<br/>&gt; who knows what might happen... but *something* will happen! Right?</p><p>I will begin my ritual prayers right away Dan.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well at least that&apos;s what I -- much like the UFO enthusiasts and the<br/>&gt; apocalyptic doomsayers -- go on year-to-year saying: &quot;any day now&quot;,<br/>&gt; &quot;any day now&quot;...</p><p>I&apos;m with you.
