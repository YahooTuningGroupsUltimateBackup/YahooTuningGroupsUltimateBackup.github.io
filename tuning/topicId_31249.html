I&apos;m<br/>&gt; concentrating on 31 and 41 because although they have much<br/>&gt; of the same resources (perhaps too much) 31 approaches it<br/>&gt; them as a meantone and 41 as a quasi-pythagorean tuning.</p><p>No, 19 doesn&apos;t fit the pattern.  Although 38 does.</p><p>But if you&apos;re talking about 31 and 41, that must be a re-mapping of<br/>Miracle.  In this case, as your generator is 3 secors, you&apos;re only getting<br/>a third of the full Miracle temperament.  Although everything&apos;s still<br/>there if you take enharmonic equivalents in 31 or 41, the approximations<br/>won&apos;t agree between them.</p><p>There&apos;s been a lot of fuss about Miracle the past year.  My best starting<br/>page is &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/miracle.htm">http://x31eq.com/miracle.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt; In Saturday improvisations I preferred 31, in part because<br/>&gt; the 5-(odd)-limit intervals are more palatable to me than the<br/>&gt; 3-(prime)-limit (more than compensating for the slightly<br/>&gt; bruised 3/2 and 4/3). I also preferred the more exagerated<br/>&gt; difference in step sizes (higher value of R).</p><p>Yes, the 5-limit approximations won&apos;t be consistent between 31 and 41 in<br/>this mapping.  The fifths will be 3:2 and the neutral thirds 11:9, which<br/>also means 12:11 and 11:8 will match.  The family that is consistent with<br/>31-equal in the 5-limit includes 24= and 38=.  Have you tried them?  And<br/>there&apos;s 17= for the more adventurous, with an approximation to 7:6.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=31332 href="#31332">ðŸ”—</a>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2001 3:01:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Mystery MOS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have certainly been exploring MOS and MOS offspring so I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; interested in this topic.

However, when you say &quot;thats the neutral third MOS&quot;,<br/>I feel it is ignoring the more pedestrian usage model that<br/>becomes available at this point in that you have major and<br/>minor triads, with the neutral third available as a third triad<br/>type, or a neighbor tone, or a tension...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the 5-limit approximations won&apos;t be consistent between 31 and 41 in<br/>&gt; this mapping.  The fifths will be 3:2 and the neutral thirds 11:9, which<br/>&gt; also means 12:11 and 11:8 will match.</p><p>As per my reply to Paul, the &quot;minor thirds&quot; and &quot;major thirds&quot; line up<br/>in a traditional notation. What changes is that the minor thirds are<br/>~6/5 vs ~32/27 and ~5/4 vs ~81/64. The 11-limit stuff is all over the<br/>place structurally between the systems, and pretty much in tune...</p><p>&gt; The family that is consistent with<br/>&gt; 31-equal in the 5-limit includes 24= and 38=.  Have you tried them?  And<br/>&gt; there&apos;s 17= for the more adventurous, with an approximation to 7:6.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Now thats catching the point. The real idea here is the LLsLLsLLLs<br/>structure. Mappings include</p><p>T-----L---s<br/>17    2   1<br/>24    3   1<br/>31    4   1<br/>38    5   1<br/>45    6   1<br/>27    3   2<br/>41    5   2<br/>55    7   2<br/>etc...</p><p>I chose 31 because I like it and 41 because I&apos;m thinking that<br/>perhaps when I am reincarnated I&apos;ll need uniqueness at<br/>the 9-limit. I should play around with a few of these given<br/>that the R value turned out to be important in side-by-side<br/>comparisons. 24 and 55 are interesting interpolations, 17 and<br/>38 head for the deeper waters...</p><p>thanks</p><p>Bob Valentine</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;                       Graham</p></div>
