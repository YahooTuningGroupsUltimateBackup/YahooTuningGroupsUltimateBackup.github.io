What I<br/>think is interesting, though, is that 76-tET supports meantone,<br/>paultone, and also the &quot;double-diatonic&quot; system (familiar from 26-<br/>tET) in which two meantone diatonic scales, at opposite sides of the<br/>circle of fifths, each complete one another&apos;s triads into 7-limit<br/>tetrads. Doubling 76-tET to 152-tET gets you wafso-just 11-limit<br/>approximations as well -- thus I call 152-tET &quot;Universal tuning&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=29575 href="#29575">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/25/2001 4:16:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Specifically, I take a paultone to be tunings with _two_ chains of<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths at the distance of 600 cents or 1/2 octave, as in 22-tET,<br/>&gt; also<br/>&gt; &gt; meeting the other criteria mentioned above.</p><p>&gt; You betcha!</p><p>I was just calculating a least squares fit of such a system in the<br/>7-limit, since I am producing an example of adaptive tempering for us<br/>to play with.
