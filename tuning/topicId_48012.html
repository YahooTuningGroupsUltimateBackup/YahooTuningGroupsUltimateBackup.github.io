For those who don&apos;t know : With some<br/>electronic gadgeteering you can assemble a circuit that produces a sawtooth<br/>shaped wave. By choosing the correct values of resistances and capacitances<br/>you can vary the frequency between very wide limits and with very small<br/>increments. With appropriate filters beautiful sounds can be produced. The<br/>frequency is not absolutely constant (as is the case in many acoustical<br/>instruments). I built a &quot;french horn&quot;which is operational in an amateur wind<br/>quintet.</p><p>My sawtooth generator produces just one tone at a time by touching one of 13<br/>contacts. Each of these 13 tones can be tuned + or - 50 cents . In tuning<br/>you are missing the assistance of a sounding interval , so you have to rely<br/>on your inner ear or whatever that may be. Anyhow : processes in our brain<br/>seem to enable us to choose a sounding tone that corresponds with our<br/><a href="http://imagination.As">imagination.As</a> I do not understand it, I give it a name : inner ear.<br/>The people I asked to do the test are amateur musicians. Most of them became<br/>quite fanatic when tuning and were disappointed when they saw the result.<br/>Even experienced singers deviated 30 cents from ET .You may find this a bad<br/>result, in fact they hit the desired frequency with a maximum deviation of<br/>2% (supposing they aimed at ET),which I think is very good</p><p>Leen</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2003 1:18:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Leen van Assendelft&quot;<br/>&lt;leenvanass@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, October 20, 2003 5:46 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: inner ear<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Leen van Assendelft&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;leenvanass@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose all tuners and most &quot;normal&quot; people have an inner ear<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;an inner voice.

I don&apos;t know<br/>what&apos;s been said, and I don&apos;t have time to check all<br/>the messages, but concerning your final question which<br/>asks if the inner ear has ever been seriously<br/>investigated:  there is a company in Silicon Valley<br/>south of San Francisco, California, which is<br/>attempting to create a virtual inner ear.  I don&apos;t<br/>know the company&apos;s name, but one of it&apos;s employees is<br/>a friend of Carl Lumma&apos;s and a friend of mine.  His<br/>automobile license plate reads &lt;&lt;COCHLEA&gt;&gt;.</p><p>                           --Mark Rankin</p><p>--- Leen van Assendelft &lt;<a href="mailto:leenvanass@wanadoo.nl">leenvanass@wanadoo.nl</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I suppose all tuners and most &quot;normal&quot; people have<br/>&gt; an inner ear and an inner voice. The inner ear can<br/>&gt; listen, the inner voice can sing. Perhaps all of our<br/>&gt; senses have a corresponding inner sense , anyhow we<br/>&gt; also have an inner eye and an inner imaging.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When we compare the precision of the inner ear with<br/>&gt; the precision of the inner eye , the inner ear is<br/>&gt; much better. I can &quot; sing &quot; a B followed by a C ,<br/>&gt; which means that my precision is better than 6 %. I<br/>&gt; guess the precision of my inner eye is some 50 %.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How good is the inner ear? I put myself that<br/>&gt; question and built a sawtooth-generator with<br/>&gt; thirteen knobs for tuning a chromatic scale and one<br/>&gt; for raising or lowering the scale as a whole. Now<br/>&gt; and then I ask a visitor to tune her or his version<br/>&gt; of the diatonic scale in C major. Most people,<br/>&gt; including myself and experienced singers deviate up<br/>&gt; to 30 cents from equal temperament .Only my<br/>&gt; daughter(55) scored between + and- 5 cents .( As a<br/>&gt; child she played the violin ).No one but myself<br/>&gt; showed any preference for a low E or a low A .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I assume that most modern ears are strongly adapted<br/>&gt; to ET and fortunately they are tolerant towards the<br/>&gt; shortcomings of that tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the inner ear can be trained. So it might be<br/>&gt; that some of you tuners have developed a better ear,<br/>&gt; or perhaps were born with it. Anyone who wants to<br/>&gt; tell me ? Has the inner ear ever been seriously<br/>&gt; investigated?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Leen<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Exclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears<br/><a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/">http://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/</a></p></div>
