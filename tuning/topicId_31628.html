The soundtrack is *not*<br/>the same as the recording of the piece, which was done later by CBS;<br/>the entire film project was nearly an afterthought, and Partch pretty<br/>much detested it.</p><p>Get, or borrow, Delusion (the CD).

To Partch; to this listener, the greatest composer yet<br/>to work with explicit microtonality, and a great composer by any<br/>right.  Delusion is a bona fide work of Art.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
