I remember a page or<br/>&gt; two of Ben Johnston&apos;s notation, the one with all the numbers for the prime<br/>&gt; harmonics etc, but it really made the page look busy. I suppose if you choose<br/>&gt; a scale without alteration (no accidentals) then modulation and other tones<br/>&gt; can be written using altered accidentals. But, how on earth would you notate a<br/>&gt; modulation to the key a comma below, like from C to c- (or however you&apos;d<br/>&gt; notate a comma flat accdental). And thus repeating this modulation, would you<br/>&gt; end up having notes such as G---, and these being equal to some other note<br/>&gt; several commas sharp, or some other note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a fixed set of notes, or fixed set of ratios (which implies a 1/1<br/>&gt; somewhere, the root of the whole scale), then that may be ok, just like, say<br/>&gt; notation in an ET. The trouble arises when you want to write string music with<br/>&gt; exactness. What I don&apos;t like is when the notation breaks down, and a perfectly<br/>&gt; nice interval get notated really horribly, just because there is a fixed<br/>&gt; notation. Certainly all of the fixed cycles of temperaments or ET scales<br/>&gt; suffer from this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s ratios seem one way out, but they don&apos;t seem to convey pitch very<br/>&gt; well, and the use of diesis like half symbols is often misread by performers,<br/>&gt; or worse they think its a flyspeck and ignore it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thin kthat notating a 4:5:6 on G as being G Bv D makes the third look flat,<br/>&gt; when we mean it to be just. True, we are altering it from its pythagorean<br/>&gt; position (ca.400cents), but surely the pythagorean position is the raised one?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; M</p><p>Not to bring up old stuff, Mark, but about a year ago we spend a few months<br/>on the list searching for the &quot;high third&quot; preferred by many singers and<br/>string players. We never found any mathematical support for it and finally<br/>assumed it to be a stylistic preference. The one thing we did agree on (I<br/>believe) is that it was *not* the pythagorean third.</p><p>(See, Paul. I told you I wouldn&apos;t be able to keep my mouth shut for long.)</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2002 6:09:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d be very interested in checking out those studies, Paul (if it&apos;s<br/>not too<br/>&gt; much trouble).</p><p>spent hours in the new york performing arts library reading these.<br/>don&apos;t have any references handy, but i&apos;m sure you yourself can easily<br/>hear that a great many classical string ensembles are relatively<br/>uninterested in bending their major triads away from 12-equal and<br/>towards 4:5:6 . . .</p></div>
