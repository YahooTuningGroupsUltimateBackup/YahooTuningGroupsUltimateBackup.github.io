Some theorists, such as Leibnitz (see Luppi, 1989), Tartini (1754 and 1767) Euler, Kirnberger and Vogel (see Vogel, 1993) add the number 7 to the &quot;senario&quot;.</p><p>Since Rameau (1750) it has been known that harmonically establishing the arithmetic relations of the first 6 or 7 natural numbers is equivalent to considering the relations for the human auditory system of the first 6 or 7 partials of a (harmonic) tone. Those in favor of including the number 7 consider the minor seventh as harmonic ratio 7/4, while those in favor of the &quot;senario&quot; consider the minor seventh as the ratio of two fifths (C:F:Bb) (3/2 x 3/2).

Gro&szlig;e M&auml;nner der Wissenschaft und der Philosophie: Huygens und Euler, Descartes, Leibniz und Rousseau, besch&auml;ftigten sich mit der Frage ihrer Einf&uuml;hrung.

The Greeks used a number of different scales, which were distinguished by the way in which the fourth, or tetrachord, was constructed. These scales were grouped into three main types or genera. One genus was called the diatonic; one example of this is the Pythagorean diatonic described above, which is built on the tetrachord with the intervals 9 : 8, 9 : 8 and 256 : 243 and was used by Philolaus and Plato. There is no doubt that Archytas knew of this diatonic scale, but his own diatonic tetrachord was somewhat different, being composed of the intervals 9 : 8, 8 : 7 and 28 : 27. Archytas also defined scales in the two other major genera, the enharmonic and chromatic. Archytas&apos; enharmonic tetrachord is composed of the intervals 5 : 4, 36 : 35 and 28 : 27 and his chromatic tetrachord of the intervals 32 : 27, 243 : 224, and 28 : 27. There are several puzzles about the tetrachords which Archytas adopts in each of the genera. First, why does Archytas reject the Pythagorean diatonic used by Philolaus and Plato? Second, Ptolemy, who is our major source for Archytas&apos; tetrachords (A16), argues that Archytas adopted as a principle that all concordant intervals should correspond to superparticular ratios. The ratios in Archytas&apos; diatonic and enharmonic tetrachords are indeed superparticular, but two of the ratios in his chromatic tetrachord are not superparticular (32 : 27 and 243 : 224). Why are these ratios not superparticular as well? Finally, Plato criticizes Pythagorean harmonics in the Republic for seeking numbers in heard harmonies rather than ascending to generalized problems (531c). Can any sense be made of this criticism in light of Archytas&apos; tetrachords? The basis for an answer to all of these questions is contained in the work of Winnington-Ingram (1932) and Barker (1989, 46-52). The crucial point is that Archytas&apos; account of the tetrachords in each of the three genera can be shown to correspond to the musical practice of his day; Ptolemy&apos;s criticisms miss the mark because of his ignorance of musical practice in Archytas&apos; day, some 500 years before Ptolemy (Winnington-Ingram 1932, 207). Archytas is giving mathematical descriptions of scales actually in use; he arrived at his numbers in part by observation of the way in which musicians tuned their instruments (Barker 1989, 50&acirc;Â€&quot;51). He did not follow the Pythagorean diatonic scale because it did not correspond to any scale actually in use, although it does correspond to a method of tuning. The unusual numbers in Archytas&apos; chromatic tetrachord do correspond to a chromatic scale in use in Archytas&apos; day. Barker tries to save Archytas&apos; adherence to the principle that all concordant intervals should have superparticular ratios, but there is no direct evidence that he was using such a principle, and Ptolemy may be mistaken to apply it to him. Archytas thus provides a brilliant analysis of the music of his day, but it is precisely his focus on actual musical practice that draws Plato&apos;s ire. Plato does not want him to focus on the music he hears about him (&acirc;Â€Âœheard harmonies&acirc;Â€&#x9D;) but rather to ascend to consider quite abstract questions about which numbers are harmonious with which. Plato might well have welcomed a principle of concordance based solely on mathematical considerations, such as the principle that only superparticular ratios are concordant, but Archytas wanted to explain the numbers of the music he actually heard played. There is an important metaphysical issue at stake here. Plato is calling for the study of number in itself, apart from the sensible world, while Archytas, like Pythagoreans before him, envisages no split between a sensible and an intelligible world and is looking for the numbers which govern sensible things.<br/>&quot;</p><p>In order to tune all the tree Achytas genera at once<br/>in a octave on ancient coeval instruments<br/>one needs in practice at least six different:</p><p><a href="http://homoecumenicus.com/ancient_instruments.htm">http://homoecumenicus.com/ancient_instruments.htm</a></p><p>then select among them for instance the well fitting :<br/>&quot;<br/>Phorminx  probably the oldest of the Cithara type instruments.

He also comments on deviations from his scales (which musically are easily explained). There is also nothing in freshman sums or medients that would lead to the scales over the vast possibilities unless they actually heard and used them. For example Archytas fixation on the 28/27 is something i have seen time and again with those who work in Just intonation. It is a very compelling interval.<br/>It seems the present day practice where the scales in scala outnumber actual composition is being projected upon the Greeks.</p><p>Doug Leedy has done extensive research on the performance of Homer</p><p>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div><h3><a id=104632 href="#104632">ðŸ”—</a>Andy &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2012 6:20:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraiggrady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ...

Winnington-Ingram speculated that perhaps the reason for this strange interval was that it was important for the note above the 28:27 to be in a 7:6 &quot;septimal minor-3rd&quot; ratio to the note which lies a 9:8 &quot;tone&quot; below its lower note.<br/>Thus, whereas the highest interval in his diatonic tetrachord is the same Pythagorean 9:8 tone indicated by Philolaus, the middle interval is the larger 8:7 &quot;septimal tone&quot;.<br/>&quot;</p><p>But attend, that maquam theorist usually dislike 7-limit intervals<br/>alike for instance group-member Ozan in his statement:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/85251">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/85251</a><br/>Quote:<br/>&quot;<br/>I don&apos;t see why (9/8 x 28/27) should be superior to (9/8 x 25/24). I<br/>don&apos;t think 76/64 is a crude interval or an approximation. It is a<br/>legitimate, nicely resonating augmented second/minor third. It&apos;s just<br/>the right flavour I need in my formulations for maqam scales. 7/6 is<br/>rather inappropriate for my purposes in fact.<br/>&quot;</p><p>While Marcel considers 28/27 versus 25/24 as indistinguishable<br/>in his contribution<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/81750">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/81750</a><br/>Quote:<br/>&quot;<br/>However simply because archytas wrote down 7-limit intervals doesn&apos;t mean he did so correctly.<br/>28/27 is for instance close enough to 25/24 to be confused with it by the ear.<br/>Or even 256/243 or 135/128.
