I.e.,  leading-tones still behave the same way, etc. etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The function of the mediant and supertonic chords are very different<br/>&gt; in major vs. minor, for example . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, of course,  but my question was. . . does a Mediant in e minor,<br/>function differently from a mediant in g# minor?</p><p>It seem the answer would be no. . .  .although, at the same time, I<br/>imagine that if a piece is in a &quot;sharp&quot; key,  modulations might tend to go<br/>&quot;flat&quot;  (i.e. towards the &quot;center&quot;),  whereas in a &quot;flat&quot; key, modulations<br/>would tend to go &quot;sharp&quot;  (again, towards the &quot;Center&quot;).  OBviously, it<br/>would be fairly subtle. . . the laws of Tonic, Dominant and Nearby Keys<br/>would still be in play . . .but you could probably make a case for it.</p><p>and it would definitely be a case of syntax deriving from tuning, as the<br/>farther &quot;out&quot; keys are. . . the farther &quot;out&quot; they sound.  thus certain<br/>cyntactical harmonic moves are favored in one case,  avoided in another.</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2005 7:09:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, of course,  but my question was. . . does a Mediant in e  minor,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; function differently from a mediant in g# minor?</p><p>Yes.  The part of my paper that explains all that is due for publication in May.</p><p>&gt; Speaking of this stuff, are there any MIDI or mp3&apos;s anywhere of<br/>&gt;side-by-side comparisons of &quot;chromatic&quot; 19th-century music tuned to ET,<br/>&gt;vs. meantone, or some other &quot;unequal&quot; tuning?</p><p>Last week I tuned my parents&apos; piano to one that handles all tonal music especially well, and spent a couple of days playing through the old piano books.  19th century music is delightful that way.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
