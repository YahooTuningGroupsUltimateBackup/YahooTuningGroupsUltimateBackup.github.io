But others of you are welcome to respond over the list if<br/>you&apos;d like.</p><p>   I have question for tuning-list CD contributors:  Are you reporting CD<br/>sales as income on your 1998 tax return?  I&apos;d be happy to report it, but<br/>I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll get into trouble with it, something like this:</p><p>IRS:  Oh, you have sole-proprietorship income?<br/>Me:  Yes, about a tenth of a percent of my entire income.<br/>IRS:  I see, then you need to file Schedule C to itemize that.<br/>Me:  OK.<br/>IRS:  Oh, by the way just where the hell is your form MRQ 1347-1283.47E<br/>      registering your sole-proprietorship?<br/>Me:  Uh...<br/>My new accountant:  OK, send this to the IRS.<br/>Me:  OK, here&apos;s your $300 consulting fee.<br/>IRS:  Alright then, where in God&apos;s name are your form XFT 1234373 forms<br/>      for tax years 1993-1997?<br/>My accountant:  Send this to the IRS.<br/>Me:  OK, here&apos;s your $450 consulting fee.<br/>IRS:  You realize that these 1993-1997 forms are late, don&apos;t you?  You owe<br/>us<br/>      $1223.56 in back taxes and penalties.</p><p>   The risks here are almost enough for me to simply return the money I&apos;ve<br/>received to the people who bought CDs from me!</p></div><h3><a id=2236 href="#2236">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/1999 5:20:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To:      <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>From:    John deLaubenfels<br/>Subject: Re: Question for Tuning-List CD Contributors<br/>Date:    04-08-99</p><p>[Gary Morrison wrote:]<br/>&gt; I have question for tuning-list CD contributors:  Are you reporting CD<br/>&gt; sales as income on your 1998 tax return?

But you ALSO need to fill out Schedule SE, a<br/>means by which Uncle Sam rips off an additional 15% of your gross income<br/>ON TOP of your actual income tax!</p><p>Schedule SE is also easy to fill out.  Opening your wallet to feed the<br/>beast is not so easy, nor necessarily morally justifiable.</p></div>
