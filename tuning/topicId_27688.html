Just checks to see if<br/>the number is a divisor to an even or to an odd power.</p><p>Only counts as divisor if to an odd power. So e.g.<br/>3 is odd power divisor of 3 and 27, but not of 9, while<br/>9 is odd power divisor of 9 and 27 (but wouldn&apos;t be<br/>an odd power divisor of 81).</p><p>Another addition. Often when selecting factors for the<br/>Eikosany one may select just a single note, or none<br/>at all. E.g. skip + select same factor. Or, select any<br/>three factors.</p><p>So added a tick box option, to ignore such selections.</p><p>Will make the selections as far as it gets before narrowing<br/>down to a single note, e.g. selecting 3 5 7 for Eikosany<br/>will have same effect as 3 5 because the last 7 restricts<br/>you to a single note.</p><p>Bug fix - while doing the coding for the factor selection,<br/>decided to extend definition for &quot;scale&quot; to allow negative<br/>values for the scale entries - so that -3 is read as &quot;skip<br/>factor 3&quot; when that value is &quot;played&quot; in a factor selection channel.<br/>That was a very easy trouble free way and kind of minimalist<br/>way to do it.</p><p>While doing so introduced a bug that means that if you saved<br/>an e-t scale in .ts format with yesterdays upload, or<br/>return to it on exit and start next session, it may well<br/>get saved as 1/1 1/1 instead of the 1/1 n(1/k)<br/>(my shorthand for 1/1 2^(1/k)). The save in .scl format is unaffected.</p><p>So this update fixes that. Sorry. Some other bug fixes.<br/>Some editing of the help for clarity - for help on the<br/>new window, save the beta preview download page. Eventually<br/>this material will get added to the help pages for FTS.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
