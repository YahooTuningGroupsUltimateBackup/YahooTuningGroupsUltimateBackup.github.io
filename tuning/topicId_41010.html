Joined by his groundbreaking ensemble, The Harmonic Choir,<br/>he uses the new resources of Harmonic Chant to create otherworldly<br/>compositions that explore the normally untapped resonances of the human<br/>voice. The one-time New York-based ensemble, now residing in France, brings<br/>together the West and the East in the exploration of natural harmonics, the<br/>&quot;DNA of all musical sounds&quot;. The choir is celebrating the 20th anniversary<br/>of their landmark recording Hearing Solar Winds, which brought the world of<br/>&quot;harmonic music&quot; to many Western listeners for the first time.  They will<br/>present the world premiere of  &quot;The Silent Ground&quot;.</p><p>Admission is free.
