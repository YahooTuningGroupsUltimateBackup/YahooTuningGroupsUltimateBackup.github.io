It&apos;s heartening to know that<br/>the state of &apos;culture&apos; in San Diego isn&apos;t as bad as I thought<br/>it was.</p><p>(Of course, the &apos;new music&apos; scene is exploding!)</p><p>And it also pretty much destroys the point I was making when<br/>using it as an example, because after all, the strike in<br/>Philadelphia was also due to administration and not lack of<br/>community support.</p><p>But I still think it&apos;s true that high concert ticket prices<br/>are the result of a lack of *general* support from the public.<br/>Classical-music lovers (who pay for the tickets *regularly*)<br/>do tend to be only a small minority of the population.</p><p>It&apos;s true that in any case where an organization is relying on<br/>&apos;member&apos; support, the fewer the members, the higher the individual<br/>cost. This is exactly why taxes keep increasing in the northeast<br/>US - the population base keeps shrinking.</p><p>BTW, Jon, good to see you back on the List.</p><p>Joseph L.
