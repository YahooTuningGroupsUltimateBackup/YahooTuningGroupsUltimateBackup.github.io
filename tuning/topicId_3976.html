Bad?  For what?</p><p>Maybe we shouldn&apos;t call any of these chords C6 or Am7, since these names<br/>are in terms of the diatonic scale.  These chords can also arise from other<br/>scales, not the least of which are harmonic series segments.</p><p>Even if we keep the names, only those who insist on playing their diatonic<br/>scale with 7 total pitches will have a problem.  And they will miss the<br/>ability to inflect these chords in different ways.</p><p>&gt;Would your default tuning for C6 be different that your default tuning for<br/>&gt;Am7?</p><p>That depends.  If I actually decided to use the Justonic chord detector ---<br/>which could play all autoharp parts in the repertoire --- I would probably<br/>set up different combos for different situations (the Justonic people were<br/>good enough to allow this, and it does provide a partial solution to the<br/>uniqueness and inversion problems)...</p><p>Combo       Am7(+1&amp;3)         C6(+1&amp;3)      Answer<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>classical   6/5 9/5           5/4 5/3       no<br/>septimal    7/6 7/4           9/7 12/7      no<br/>mixed       7/6 7/4           5/4 5/3       yes<br/>strange     13/11 20/11       5/4 13/8      yes<br/>neutral     11/9 16/9         16/13 22/13   yes<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>-C.</p></div>
