I&apos;m researching<br/>what it will take to refret a guitar to either<br/>19 or 22 tone ET. I&apos;m also playing around with<br/>CSound.</p><p>  I&apos;d like a tuner program. Ideally, I&apos;d like<br/>to give it a frequency (say, 440hz), have it<br/>calculate the octave above and below, split<br/>those octaves into cents, and tell me exactly<br/>what I&apos;m playing to 2 or 3 digits of accuracy.<br/>So I could have a list of cent deviations for<br/>some scale, play a note, and it would tell me<br/>how many cents I&apos;m deviating from the unison<br/>that I entered.</p><p>  Anything like that available? It should be<br/>easy enough to do.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Darin &quot;Basil&quot; Arrick<br/><a href="mailto:basil@homestead.org">basil@homestead.org</a></p></div>
