I will bring<br/>along a couple of refretted guitars, some pieces and scores and talk about<br/>what I do. I&apos;ve been interested lately in what the practical limits are<br/>for performers and their instruments in these tunings, and how to address<br/>these in composition/performance. I hope to start up a good discussion<br/>with everyone there, not just a lecture. I will also play and describe<br/>works in 19 tone equal temperament, 31 tone equal temperament and 43 tone<br/>just intonation (Partch&apos;s Monophony). There may even be free donuts!</p><p>As leader of Toronto&apos;s only dedicated microtonal group, Critical Band, I<br/>have been trying to figure out how to deal with alternate tunings for<br/>several years now, and would love to share ideas with all interested.</p><p>John Gzowski</p></div>
