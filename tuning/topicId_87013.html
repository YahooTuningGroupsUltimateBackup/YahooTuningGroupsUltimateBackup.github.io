I was looking for all of the ratios p/q between 5/4 and 81/64 with 5 &lt; p &lt; 81 and 4 &lt; q &lt; 64. My aim was to see if there is a way to get from the &apos;high-numbered&apos; intervals to the &apos;low numbered&apos; ones. Now, I started by taking all the mediants (5 + 81)/(4 + 64) = 43/34, then the mediants of the mediants, and so on. But the problem with this is that it goes on forever and doesn&apos;t approach 5/4. At any rate, after going on for some time I eventually got the following list: {5/4, 24/19, 43/34, 62/49, 81/64}.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting is that I found these match a formula. Given the higher numbered interval as say a/b, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve Bezout&apos;s equation ax + by = 1. (Or you can use an applet at</p><p><a href="http://wims.unice.fr/wims/wims.cgi?module=tool/arithmetic/bezout.en">http://wims.unice.fr/wims/wims.cgi?module=tool/arithmetic/bezout.en</a></p><p>).</p><p>Then all of the other intervals can be obtained as p = a (mod y) and q = b (mod x).</p><p>Eg: a/b = 81/64 in Bezout&apos;s equation gives x = -15, y = 19. Then 81 = (4 x 19) + 5, 62 = (3 x 19) + 5 etc...and 64 = (4 x 15) + 4, 49 = (3 x 15) + 4 etc...IOW all the numerators equal 5 (Mod 19) and all the denominators 4 (mod 15).</p><p>Eg2: a/b = 32/27 gives x = 11 and y = -13. Therefore 32/13 = 2 + 6/13 or 32 = 2*13 + 6 and 27 = 2*11 + 5. It is easy to calculate that the two intervals below are {6/5, 19/16}.</p><p>(Note also that each adjacent pair p/q and a/b satisfy the Diophantine equation aq - pb = 1 which suggests that they are a branch on the Stern-Brocot tree).</p><p>IOW this seems to give a direct method of getting from the higher intervals to the lower ones. But I don&apos;t quite understand why that is just yet. What I&apos;d like to know is whether this method is well-known and if so where can I look it up?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=87014 href="#87014">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2010 12:52:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 24 March 2010 06:57, rick &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; IOW this seems to give a direct method of getting from the higher intervals to the lower ones.

They<br/>could temperaments generated by a fifth and octave that temper out<br/>81/64, for example.  The 24-tet may appear to qualify, but you&apos;re<br/>really generating only 12 notes per octave.  You can also use the<br/>jargon and say you have to temper out 81/64 with no contorsion.</p><p>Note there are meantone temperaments that don&apos;t fit the pattern.  But<br/>they&apos;re still the sum of other meantone temperaments.  19+31=50, for<br/>example.</p><p>Note: the big temperament has a tuning in between the two little<br/>temperaments, which you can show on the scale tree.  Repeatedly adding<br/>12 gets you progressively closer to 12-tet.</p><p>&gt; Or, put another way:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12-tet - commonly viewed as a &quot;meantone&quot;, + 12 =<br/>&gt; 24-tet - also viewed as a &quot;meantone&quot; with 11-limit implications, + 12 =</p><p>It would be a different temperament class in the 11-limit because the<br/>generator isn&apos;t a fifth any more.  There are different ways of doing<br/>it, because you could split the fourth or the fifth, and the 7-limit<br/>can be mapped differently if you include it.  They may belong to the<br/>&quot;meantone family&quot; but I forget how Gene defined that.</p><p>&gt; 72-tet - not viewed as a &quot;meantone&quot; anymore.</p><p>It wouldn&apos;t normally be a meantone because it has a better 5:4 than<br/>12-tet gives you.  You could define a 72-tet mapping that belongs to<br/>the meantone family (if I&apos;m getting the word right) but that&apos;d be<br/>somewhat eccentric.  And the result would still be 12-tet for 5-limit<br/>harmony.</p><p>&gt; Is it just some kind of useful rule of thumb, or is there a deeper rigorous mathematical background to it that I&apos;m missing?</p><p>There certainly is a mathematical background, and it can be rigorous<br/>if you like.  The way Gene defined it, no temperament should have<br/>contorsion.  So 24-tet is misnamed in the 5-limit.  It isn&apos;t a<br/>temperament, only a contorted rendering of 12-tet.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=87020 href="#87020">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2010 4:11:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Graham,</p><p>Of course I&apos;m by no means claiming that the use of mediants or the S-B tree is unique.

Just to be clear, what I&apos;ve found is that for any ratio a/b (where a and b are coprime) we can find the other approximate coprime ratios in three steps 1) first we solve ax + by = 1 to find x and y, 2) we take a/y = N + p/y, b/x = N + q/x to find the remainders p and q, and 3) all the intervals in this set will be ((n*y) + p)/((n*x) + q) where n = 0,1,2,3...</p><p>To give the eg again, a/b = 81/64,<br/>1) solving 81x + 64y = 1 gives x = -15, y = 19,<br/>2)taking 81/19 = 4 + 5/19 and 64/15 = 4 + 4/15 gives p = 5 and q = 4,and<br/>3) gives ((n*19) + 5)/((n*15) + 4) = {5/4, 24/19, 43/34, 62/49, 81/64...}</p><p>Although this can be seen as the set of all mediants between n*19/n*15 and p/q, it is not exactly the same as taking the mediants between 81/64 and 5/4.

So it&apos;s not meantone.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And even if we made an exception, the meantone-like val you&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; use in 24 has torsion so it&apos;s not valid temperament anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; As a scale, however, there may be an acceptable meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning within 24-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For a scale to support meantone temperament, it must satisfy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the map<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 1  2  4 ]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 0 -1 -4 ]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the 5-limit.
