In<br/>the past several months we exchanged many emails about improving<br/>its microtuning features. Now there is a stable release which is<br/>very worthwhile to be tried:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_download.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_download.htm</a></p><p>The program is for Windows and shareware. Since Robert is an<br/>independent inventor, he can use the fee if you register the<br/>program, so I want to encourage people to do that if they like it.<br/>The program offers really a wealth of possibilities for<br/>trying out tunings. It can play a scale automatically, in a fractal<br/>way, one can play the notes using the mouse or number keys on the<br/>keyboard, and also via MIDI-in (then it can perform the same<br/>function as Graham Breed&apos;s MIDI Relay). It works with all<br/>soundcards and synthesizers. It&apos;s also well integrated with Scala.<br/>It can read the scale and mode file formats. If you have created a<br/>scale in Scala, it&apos;s possible to start F.T.S. and immediately play<br/>with it. To do so, create the following file and call it<br/>smithy.cmd.</p><p>! smithy.cmd<br/>echo Open Fractal Tune Smithy with the current scale<br/>set onerror cont<br/>remove xxx.scl<br/>save xxx.scl<br/>Saved scale from Scala<br/>spawn/detached &quot;c:\program files\fractal tune smithy\fractal tune smithy&quot; xxx.scl</p><p>(The last line begins with &quot;spawn&quot; and is long, if the list program<br/>breaks it.) Then type <a href="https://twitter.com/smithy">@smithy</a> inside Scala. Conversely, Scala can<br/>also be started from F.T.S. But there are already a lot of scales<br/>built in.<br/>So, try it and don&apos;t forget to hit the &quot;Scale&quot; and &quot;Arpeggio&quot;<br/>buttons.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2000 8:45:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &lt;MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@E...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12062">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12062</a></p><p>Hello Manuel!</p><p>Fractal Tune Smithy is really cool.

And thank you for taking some of my<br/>&gt;little suggestions seriously.  Also, by the way, I wasn&apos;t getting the<br/>&gt;software to immediately interact with my MIDI keyboard (??)</p><p>Ah, I wonder why. Maybe if i describe how it should work it could help pin<br/>down the problem.</p><p>It&apos;s In | Open Now to open MIDI in.</p><p>You also need to tick the appropriate device on the In list.</p><p>To open MIDI In at start of every session, tick In | Options | Open ... at<br/>start of session. (and make sure you have File | Auto Save Config ticked).</p><p>The notes you get depend on the scale / mode selected. So if you choose New,<br/>and have the defaults for the MIDI In options, what you get is 12 tet with<br/>the<br/>pentatonic notes played from on successive white notes of the keyboard, and<br/>the black notes playing some of the in between notes. That&apos;s because I<br/>wanted to start with something both familiar and nice sounding, and it&apos;s<br/>played on the modern flute, which is quite appropriate for 12 tet.</p><p>For a more useful set up for playing from MIDI keyboard, choose one of the<br/>presets from In | Options.</p><p>If any of those steps don&apos;t work, maybe you could let me know, and any error<br/>messages you may have got, and I&apos;ll see if I can figure it out, or to<br/>duplicate it here.</p><p>&gt;I am quite amazed by the work that you have done with this... and it<br/>&gt;surely is a great accomplishment.  Sorry, again, if I was critical...<br/>&gt;I guess I was just in my own &quot;little world&quot; for a moment, and needed<br/>&gt;the software to do a couple of things that were important to me....<br/>&gt;Just momentary frustation.</p><p>&gt;But, good luck with this... and fractals really are beautiful.</p><p>Thanks :-)</p><p>&gt;Maybe it would be interesting to have an audible display accompanied<br/>&gt;by VISUAL FRACTALS...  I could see an art gallery doing this as a<br/>&gt;continuing exhibition.  Very hip.</p><p>Nice idea...</p><p>Could include some Penrose tilings as well - because of the Fibonacci<br/>tonescapes.</p><p>I wonder if you&apos;ve discovered the option to search the SCALA archive<br/>yet? File | Scales Options | Search scales or modes list.</p><p>If you show the SCALA drop list (as I described in earlier posting), then<br/>you can search it for a scale that uses a particular interval, or has some<br/>particular word in its description, and (new in this beta) you can combine<br/>the search with setting a particular desired number of notes, or range of<br/>numbers of notes for the scale.</p><p>When doing repeated searches, one useful tip is to show the Arpeggio window<br/>first, with the SCALA scales in it, then untick Sync modes, and Sync scale<br/>with m. w., and after each search, click -&gt; Lists to copy the complete list<br/>of SCALA scales back into the main window drop list.</p><p>Hope you can get the MIDI in working with FTS!</p><p>Has some extras to discover like option to use the sustain pedal to toggle<br/>sharps / flats (see 19 tone preset for instance, and the &quot;In | Options |<br/>Accidentals as&quot; drop list).</p><p>:-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2000 6:41:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>For those interested in FTS:</p><p>New upload of beta now has the record to Wav button.

If the mode / arp. box shows one of<br/>&gt;the modes, then FTS can get the number of notes in the et scale from<br/>&gt;the mode box.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I see what you&apos;re saying... that would be a great improvement!</p><p>- done now!</p><p>Also for case the other way round, where arpeggio repeats several times in<br/>the formal octave, while scale is specified by giving all the notes.</p><p>That leaves the case where both scale and arpeggio repeat several times in<br/>the formal octave, e.g. for follow scale for any n-tet scale, or for the<br/>tritone / diminished seventh / whole tone defs in the default 12 t drop<br/>list.</p><p>In these cases, one can&apos;t work out the formal octave from either of the<br/>lists.</p><p>So I&apos;ve added an option to specify a min top note for the scale / mode. Its<br/>in the Arpeggio / scale playback config window - see &quot;min top note for main<br/>window playback&quot;. Repeats the scale or arp. as many times as are needed,<br/>until last note reaches the &quot;Min top note for main window playback&quot; or<br/>higher.</p><p>How can TS know what to use for the min top note? Well, I&apos;ve done a best<br/>guess method for this. When TS opens a list of modes, it sets the min top<br/>note to the interval for the last note of the last mode in the list.</p><p>So when you select the et Bohlen-Pierce scale in the Scala Modes list, if<br/>you have Sync Modes ticked, then TS will open the Bohlen-Pierce modes list,<br/>and set the min top note to 3/1, and will use this for playback of the scale<br/>for follow scale.</p><p>(this can be switched off by unticking a box if you want to keep to a<br/>particular min top note).</p><p>For more details of how it all works, see beta download page.</p><p>When the scale doesn&apos;t have a list of modes associated with it, defaulting<br/>to the one with things like 0 -1 2 in it, the min top note defaults to 2/1.</p><p>If one wants it to be something else, say, for scales defined by repeating<br/>blocks, or whatever, one has to set it oneself by hand. One would then prob.<br/>want to untick the box that tells TS to keep resetting it to 2/1 whenever<br/>you select a scale from the drop lists.</p><p>Anyway, the proof of the pudding as they say, look forward to hearing if<br/>this heuristic works okay.</p><p>&gt;Ummm.  In my case it was a &quot;real&quot; crash... &quot;program has performed an<br/>&gt;illegal operation...&quot;  It had to be shut down each time... it wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt;just the sound of it...</p><p>Ah, sorry about that!</p><p>I haven&apos;t been able to duplicate it here at all, wonder what it is,...</p><p>That message can mean various things, but often is because a variable has<br/>gone out of it&apos;s expected range. I&apos;ve gone through the playback code adding<br/>some extra automatic checks for ranges of variables, in the hope that that<br/>might catch it. If it happens again, could help to know if it just happens<br/>for the main window, or also happens if you press the play buttons for the<br/>Scale, or Arpeggio windows. Could also help locate it to know if TS gets to<br/>play any of the notes, or crashes before it plays any of them.</p><p>FractalTS is fine.

(For what it&apos;s worth).  I&apos;ll try the &quot;new improvements&quot;<br/>&gt;and let you know more details about any crashes...</p><p>Thanks. I&apos;ll prob. change it to TS in the help. One less letter to type...</p><p>Yes do say about any crashes...</p><p>They are usually fairly easy to fix if reproducible, especially the illegal<br/>operations ones - the debugger will often just take you straight to the line<br/>of code where it crashed, with a record of all the variables to look at, and<br/>it is then usually obvious what has happened..</p><p>If I can&apos;t reproduce it here it&apos;s more tricky, and is a matter of looking<br/>for likely things and fixing them, which I _might_ have done with the<br/>endlessly ascending scale.</p><p>Depending on details might fix it just from thinking over description of<br/>what happened.</p><p>However there is another alternative too, which is to get TS to keep a log<br/>of where it has got to, and values of variables. This can be a good method<br/>for some types of bug. One would activate it, say, by typing &quot;#debug&quot; into<br/>the time for one note box. Then you would need to send the log file to me<br/>(lot&apos;s of boring stuff!), and I&apos;d just need to look at the last line, and<br/>prob. see exactly where it was and what the values of the variables were<br/>when it crashed. Sometimes adding debug code stops the crash - like, it only<br/>happens when you aren&apos;t looking kind of syndrome.... Also depends on<br/>narrowing down where it happens to some extent first (e.g., that it crashes<br/>in response to a particular button). So not guaranteed, but a pretty good<br/>method all the same.</p><p>Could do that if it is one you find troublesome and that I can&apos;t reproduce<br/>here. (I&apos;m always happy to locate any bug in TS, depends on whether you also<br/>were interested enough to want to download debug version, crash it, and send<br/>the log file back to me.)</p><p>&gt;Thanks so much, Robert, for the &quot;improvements!&quot;  I now can play a<br/>&gt;&quot;regular&quot; 31-tone scale that actually STOPS at the octave, before I<br/>&gt;can listen to the &quot;fractal variations.&quot;</p><p>&gt;TS is getting better all the time!  Thanks again!</p><p>Great!</p><p>I too find the new scale buttons incredibly useful now that they are there,<br/>and it&apos;s great to be able to just play a mode too immediately and hear what<br/>it sounds like. Thanks for suggesting the idea!</p><p>N.B. I&apos;ve just found a bug in the record to Wav button. Sometimes it records<br/>okay first time, but not second time, and you have to exit and re-start<br/>again, Saves in &quot;unrecognised format&quot;.</p><p>I have just fixed it, and will be done for next upload, either tonight, or<br/>looks more like, tomorrow,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2000 7:37:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have just started updating the FTS beta again.</p><p>Now at:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm</a></p><p>N.B. this is a new progs download site I&apos;m setting up for bandwidth<br/>reasons in preparation for release of 1.09.</p><p>Fixes a number of bugs - see download page for details. Including<br/>all those mentioned earlier on this list.</p><p>Relaying from midi In especially will be crisper and clearer. Esp.<br/>for voices like harp that continue to sound after the MIDI note<br/>has been switched off.</p><p>-----------------------------]<br/>New version uses least recently used algorithm for pitch bend<br/>channels.</p><p>Result is, when using it for relaying from MIDI In, normally you<br/>end up with a channel for each pitch bend, provided you need at most<br/>15 pitch bends (as always will be case for mode of 15 notes or<br/>less repeating at octave, or at most 15 notes with differing pitch<br/>bends sounding at once).</p><p>This will also prob. make MIDI relaying crisper in general since<br/>it is common for a voice to resonate quietly for a short while<br/>after it is switched off.</p><p>When the pitch bend for a channel does need to be changed,<br/>sends an all sound off message first (old version had bug that<br/>meant it didn&apos;t do this when relaying from MIDI in, which meant<br/>it would pitch bend notes from voices such as Orchestral harp<br/>that continue to sound _after they are &quot;switched off&quot;_ - you could<br/>hear the old notes change pitch as they were pitch bent into<br/>12-tet intervals with new notes played).<br/>[-----------------------------</p><p>Also other bug fixes, and extra code to help when used to relay<br/>output from another program, e.g. when used to re-tune the output<br/>from Play button of a score editor. One important bug fix - prev.<br/>version of beta would on occasion leave out some of the first few<br/>pitch bends needed in option to save to MIDI file _as  you play<br/>along_ - fixed.</p><p>New version also fixes the chord and broken chords button pitch<br/>bends bug mentioned before on this list.</p><p>Plus two new options that can be switched on:</p><p>SCALA decimal point convention when entering new scales as cents.<br/>Skip all patches in MIDI output.</p><p>See beta download page for details of these.</p><p>This is an especially good time to mention any more bugs found, or<br/>any suggestions.</p><p>I plan to release FTS 1.09 v. soon, and start work on a next<br/>version. Main thing still to do is to update the help for new<br/>options.</p><p>Next version after this one will have a chords window, used to<br/>find and play chords in any of the scales and modes.</p><p>It&apos;s inspired by exciting development of the chord recognition and<br/>chords list in the new version of SCALA, and will use this list.<br/>One will be able to use the new chords window to play and select<br/>chords from the SCALA list - idea for this is in sketch form at<br/>present, with some details still to be worked out, however I am<br/>ready to start programming it straight away, as soon as FTS 1.09<br/>is released.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
