Is this &quot;media&quot; complicity in the crassest and most unconscionable trash force-feeding of all of our minds unchallenged?  Apparently, there can be a lot of money to be made through complicity agreements (???) to participate in what the Nader campaign characterized as the commodification of [&quot;fucking&quot;] EVERYTHING, including childhood.</p><p>Christ!  I won&apos;t have a cel-phone, so I didn&apos;t know that they now can spam you through &quot;text- messaging&quot;, and eat up all your memory with bullshit that makes the thing beep constantly, if you haven&apos;t read the manual (carefully enough?), which is probably written to defy any of your meaningful questions about how the cheap fucking equipment you (or your employer!) bought works, if you&apos;re a person who thinks they need to rely on automobiles to function, and other such nonsense.</p><p>&quot;Conspiracy theories have always been nonsense, in some ways, because they simply pit one stripe of idealogue against another.  (My Random House dictionary doesn&apos;t list the word &quot;idealogue&quot;--I wonder, at this time, who coined it?  And who refused to print it in the dictionary, at that time?)</p><p>Is it the one who stands to make the most money &quot;at the expense of&quot; or more generally &quot;versus&quot; the other?  Is it a &quot;conspiracy&quot; of &quot;profit&quot;?</p><p>Yes, I think there are conspiracies of rich against poor, as there have always been, but there are, more simply and directly, the conspiracies of men and women who wanted more for their children and themselves, who never wanted more than to somehow be able to write spams that would generate incomes for themselves and their children, we may generously hope, just as we may hope that they dreamed of make low-priced goods that keep us warm, and well-fed.</p><p>&quot;Obscene profit?&quot;</p><p>Of course, it is.</p><p>Ask yourself.  What is your revenue stream?</p><p>Who makes your shit, and who buys it, at what relative prices?</p><p>If I mount a theatrical production, at tremendous cost of cast and crew, and rental of venue, and technical requirements, and I get a box office of $840 bucks, of whom 16 players are not getting paid, whom have I paid?  Why did they get paid.  The others did not get paid, and would not have demanded that the company go into loss on acoount of their nonpayment, because they believed in the company&apos;s sometime ability to support itself, and on it&apos;s own quality and dedication.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Free Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now</p></div><h3><a id=48567 href="#48567">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2003 3:03:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Please pardon my ignorance, but can a moderator actually stop these<br/>&gt;people, without bringing down some more comprehensive intervention<br/>&gt;in the whole enterprise?</p><p>In fact they can.

What is easier form moderators may also<br/>be better for everybody because of improved &quot;dialog&quot; performance for new<br/>list members, at times when the moderators are not totally &quot;snappy&quot; in their<br/>responsiveness, or when everybody is on vacation or asleep, which *will*<br/>happen at times no matter how many moderators you get.  Also if being a<br/>moderator is easy, we will get more volunteers to be moderators, from people<br/>in different time zones, contents, and sleep schedules.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

I predict they will eventually have software that<br/>pulls out an old post that looks to be fairly typical of people&apos;s<br/>first posts - one they hope everyone has forgotten about - or a<br/>combination of some - and plagiarises them. It will keep trying that<br/>from different fake addresses, until it sees that one of them has<br/>gotten thru in a short time, thereby indicating that the address used<br/>is probably now unmoderated. Then they will post the spam.</p><p>That&apos;s one reason I think Paul Erlich would make an excellent<br/>moderator. He&apos;s probably read, and reads, more of this list than<br/>anyone. Carl Lumma would be good too.</p><p>But so long as so many groups do not use the feature I described,<br/>there is no incentive for them to bother with such fancy software. But<br/>mark my words, there wil eventually be evil AIs on the net whose only<br/>purpose is to get their master&apos;s advertising into places where it<br/>isn&apos;t wanted.</p></div>
