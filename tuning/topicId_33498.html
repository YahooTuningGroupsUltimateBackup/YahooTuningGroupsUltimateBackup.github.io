Schulter &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 30, 2002 9:32 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, Monz, and what a delight to be exchanging messages with<br/>&gt; you about Boethius, semiditones, 18:17:16 divisions, and the like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your mention of Vincenzo Galileo&apos;s use of 18:17 to approach a 12-EDO<br/>&gt; semitone, actually more accurate on a lute than the logarithmically<br/>&gt; correct fret spacing according to Mark Lindley because of fretting<br/>&gt; pressure,  ...</p><p>Hmmm ... I just mentioned a few hours ago in another post (I think<br/>on tuning-math) the ISMA conference I attended in Italy in September.<br/>There were a lot of presentations on the acoustics of plucked strings<br/>(and even more on bowed strings), and some of them explored the<br/>specifics of pitch alterations due to fretting pressure.  I was<br/>*particularly* interested in this, because my presentation at that<br/>conference concerned John Dowland&apos;s unusual lute fretting, and explored<br/>some of the bizarre beating dissonances Dowland stipulated in his<br/>tablature scores.</p><p>I think I mentioned here before that the conference proceedings are<br/>available from the publisher (in Venice) for 90 Euro (about $90 US)<br/>-- expensive, but worth it if you&apos;re seriously interested in this<br/>kind of thing.  Or perhaps you have access to a library that has<br/>it, or maybe they can be talked into purchasing it if they don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; ... reminds me of my idea for a 21st-century fretting solution:<br/>&gt; just use successive ratios of 25:24. However, I&apos;ll refrain from<br/>&gt; calling this &quot;JI&quot;; formal RI plus a bit of octave stretching is more<br/>&gt; like it.</p><p>So where d stands for degree, and each step is (25/24)^d,</p><p>   d   ~cents</p><p>   17  1201.43<br/>   16  1130.76<br/>   15  1060.09<br/>   14   989.41<br/>   13   918.74<br/>   12   848.07<br/>   11   777.40<br/>   10   706.72<br/>    9   636.05<br/>    8   565.38<br/>    7   494.71<br/>    6   424.03<br/>    5   353.36<br/>    4   282.69<br/>    3   212.02<br/>    2   141.34<br/>    1    70.67</p><p>Well, aren&apos;t you clever!  That deviates from 17-EDO by no more<br/>than ~1.43 cents, so it&apos;s no surprise to me that *you* like it,<br/>Margo!  I like it -- a simple ratio like that makes it easy to fret.</p><p>&gt; While I much regret not mentioning Dave Keenan&apos;s definition in my<br/>&gt; earlier post on &quot;What is JI,&quot; I&apos;m delighted that my omission prompted<br/>&gt; others to remedy this fault, calling attention to a viewpoint that<br/>&gt; deserves to be noticed whenever this topic comes up.</p><p>Yes, as I&apos;ve said, I&apos;d like to add much from what Dave posted back then<br/>to my definition.  But that would take some time.</p><p>&gt; For now, while I consider a longer post on &quot;What JI means to me,&quot;<br/>&gt; please let me add that you have frequently made it clear that you set<br/>&gt; no arbitrary limits on JI, literally or figuratively, but like me have<br/>&gt; been intrigued by writers such as Fabio Colonna who discuss higher<br/>&gt; primes and integer ratios.</p><p>And don&apos;t forget that I&apos;m also intrigued by La Monte Young&apos;s music,<br/>which explores even higher primes in actual sound, and which I&apos;ve<br/>had the good fortune to be able to experience in his Dream House.<br/>(Thanks to David Beardsley for inviting me there several times.)</p><p>&gt; Recently I have felt a special wonder at reading Kathleen Schlesinger,<br/>&gt; and seeing her mention many of my favorite ratios -- in 1939. Maybe<br/>&gt; I&apos;d compare her treatise on _The Greek Aulos_ to some late<br/>&gt; 16th-century Italian efforts to achieve a dramatic music along Greek<br/>&gt; lines -- the origins of the opera, of course.</p><p>Yes, I too am fascinated with Schlesinger&apos;s work.  Unfortunately,<br/>I still haven&apos;t read all of her book, having continuously gotten<br/>hung up on various particular aspects of her theories which I then<br/>explored further on my own.</p><p>In one roundabout case (via research into Greek musical notation)<br/>this further exploration resulted in what I consider one of my most<br/>important papers: &quot;An Examination of a Possible 5-Limit System of<br/>Boethius&quot;, which is still as yet unpublished.</p><p>I think it would be fantastic if you could provide a summary of<br/>_The Greek Aulos_ to the list.  It would help me when I eventually<br/>get back to reading it.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, this is mainly to say thanks, for your most recent reply and<br/>&gt; your many contributions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>What a warm response!  Thank you, Margo.  It&apos;s always such a pleasure<br/>when the two of us engage in dialog here that I wish it would happen<br/>more often.</p><p>... And discussions with you help pull me a bit away from the<br/>math, and more into the history, which is really even more<br/>fascinating to me and what I do much better anyway.</p><p>The main reason I&apos;ve gotten so wrapped up in tuning math (which<br/>I don&apos;t even really understand all that well) is my interest in<br/>applying it visually in my software project.  I&apos;d really like<br/>to get the software finished and then *use* it to create terrific<br/>animated-with-audio webpages which explore the *history* of tuning.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. Aside to Jon Wild: the distinction you report in Aristoxenos between<br/>&gt; the simple and composite use of an interval such as the ditone or major<br/>&gt; third very much reminds me of the Vicentino-Lusitano controversy (does any<br/>&gt; use of a melodic minor or major third represent an element of the<br/>&gt; chromatic or enharmonic genus, so that almost all music is actually<br/>&gt; &quot;mixed&quot; rather than diatonic?). Here Lusitano and later Zarlino took the<br/>&gt; position you report, arguing that the chromatic semitone and enharmonic<br/>&gt; diesis are characteristic of these genera, while major and minor thirds<br/>&gt; are also routine as composite intervals in the diatonic.</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
