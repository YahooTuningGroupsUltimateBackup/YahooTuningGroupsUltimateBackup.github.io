At least they&apos;ve<br/>been able to put out lots of books and newsletters.  They haven&apos;t worked<br/>out the difference between German and Dutch yet.  This Klavar notation<br/>looks interesting</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/Jo.Jansen.Deurne/totklave.htm">http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/Jo.Jansen.Deurne/totklave.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>or</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/Jo.Jansen.Deurne/totklavn.htm">http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/Jo.Jansen.Deurne/totklavn.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>in Dutch (not German) avoiding the frames and the background music.</p><p>It&apos;s partly Erv Wilson&apos;s dodecatonic notation turned on its side, and<br/>without the accidentals to get you beyond 12 notes.  I can&apos;t find anything<br/>there or on the linked website (which started throwing popups at me) about<br/>when it was supposed to have been invented.</p><p>&gt; One of their criteria is that the notation must be &quot;adaptable to a<br/>&gt; variety of microtonal systems&quot;. But they apparently assume that 12-tET<br/>&gt; is the best or only possible basis for that and that Ab will always<br/>&gt; equal G# etc.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t find anything on the microtonality either.  Basing it on a 12<br/>note octave makes some sense, as it&apos;s the way musicians already seem to be<br/>thinking.  And it&apos;s common to meantone, schismic and diaschismic<br/>temperaments.  Not especially useful for neutral third scales though.</p><p>                            Graham</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 8:58:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/25/02 9:11 AM, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; These guys are hilarious.
