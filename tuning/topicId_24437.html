However, I very much like the quarter-tone interval itself. I<br/>have found it to have this characteristic: when two notes, a quarter-tone<br/>apart, are played rather high, and in a soft dynamic, they sound very<br/>pleasant. When the same notes are played in a strong dynamic, they sound<br/>extremely agressive.</p><p>Also, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m breaking any ground here (probably not...), but I<br/>think it&apos;s very interesting to see the 24-tET as a 12-tET superimposed on a<br/>12-tET a quarter-tone lower. Then, these two units can be treated as two<br/>different keys. Out of this comes the possibility to create &quot;atonality&quot; and<br/>dissonance with the same methods as Stravinsky: superimposing a theme in one<br/>key on an accompaniment in another key.</p><p>But, another thing, which is sort of the child of the previous idea, is, and<br/>it is something that will be used a lot in my piece, this: to take a very<br/>pleasant and consonant interval (i.e. a 3d or a 6th), have several<br/>instruments play it for some time, then add the same interval, an octave and<br/>a quarter-tone lower. This way one gets very aggressive dissonant passages<br/>which build up from a very pleasant one. This way one gets a dissonant piece<br/>with little glimpses of tonality and beauty here and there. I think it&apos;s a<br/>very interesting gimmick, and of a large symbolic value. I like it very<br/>much.</p><p>&gt; One thing I might observe: as is true in history, so here, musicians<br/>&gt; and theorists may have quite different views as to what is &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>&gt; or pleasing.

It takes 6 _separate_ Pythagorean<br/>&gt; chains to get you all 72 notes. And fortuitously, starting<br/>&gt; from &quot;regular&quot; 12-tET representing Pythagorean ratios, the 5 extra<br/>&gt; chains are obtained by, in ascending order<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) (1/12 tone up  ) dividing ratios by 5<br/>&gt; 2) (1/6  tone up  ) dividing ratios by 7<br/>&gt; 3) (1/4  tone up  ) multiplying or dividing ratios by 11<br/>&gt; 4) (1/6  tone down) multiplying ratios by 7<br/>&gt; 5) (1/12 tone down) multiplying ratios by 5</p><p>You might want to start with the following post where I suggested<br/>the &quot;bicycle&quot; terminology, half in jest.
