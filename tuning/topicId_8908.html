I did intend the 31-tET approximation for Arabic, not Persian,<br/>scales, so the large discrepancies are to be expected. Mohammed<br/>Gharib says, on his web page, that Persian tuning could be considered<br/>a subset of 43-tET, so perhaps we should look at that. In any case,<br/>thanks for the info above, that really helps. I have serious qualms<br/>about Anooshfar&apos;s ratios, though: they seem &quot;cooked&quot;. Since you&apos;ll find 25<br/>and 25*2^n in the denominator of some ratios, but 5 or 5*2^n is not in the<br/>denominator of any ratios, this tuning system requires that one perceive<br/>ratios of 25 directly, which I find impossible. Anooshfar seems to be yet<br/>another victim of high-number low-prime mentality.</p></div>
