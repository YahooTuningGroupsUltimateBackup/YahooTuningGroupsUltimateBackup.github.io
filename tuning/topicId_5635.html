I have already had the experience of having my<br/>postings misrepresented in external citations, and I wish to limit the<br/>potential for further misrepresentation as much as possible.  While many<br/>people who cite the list do seek permission from individual authors to<br/>include citations, this is a far from universal practice.  I would hope that<br/>the wishes of the author would be respected in this matter; if this is not<br/>the case, then I have no choice but to simply stop posting.</p><p>Drew Skyfyre argues for an &quot;integrity&quot; of the list contents. Anyone who has<br/>participated in the list for any length of time will surely realize that the<br/>list lacks (and happily so) any trace of design integrity. The discussion is<br/>wide ranging in topic, tone, and level.  As wonderfull as some individual<br/>postings may be, there is a huge amount of items with rotten orthography,<br/>ill-formulated expressions, errors of fact, and (yes, even here) intemperate<br/>outbursts.  These are not the proceedings of some political or legal body, so<br/>the veracity of the record is of far less importance than the right of<br/>contributors to present their work in the form that they choose.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
