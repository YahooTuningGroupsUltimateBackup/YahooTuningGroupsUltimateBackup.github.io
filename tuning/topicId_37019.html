It&apos;s easy to spot a<br/>microtonal player who really has it down.  He says it comes from 25<br/>years of playing with Joe Maneri&apos;s group.  It&apos;s great news to find<br/>somebody who has mastered this language so expertly, and he has a<br/>great tone as well.  (Johnny Reinhard also says Washburne has a<br/>doctorate in ethnomusicology from Columbia... among these other<br/>accomplishments)...</p><p>Don&apos;t forget to come to the concert for this Blackjack premiere<br/>(trombone and electronics)</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s true we&apos;re doing BLACKJACK at ROULETTE!
