Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2003 9:43:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I&apos;d like to share some impressions of what<br/>might be a very curious tuning system from an historical as well as<br/>contemporary perspective.</p><p>Let&apos;s approach this as an enigma of sorts. You are sitting at a<br/>keyboard and find that a tuning system includes some minor sevenths at<br/>about 983 cents; major third sizes of a few cents smaller than a pure<br/>4:5 and very close to a pure 7:9 (the latter at around 434 cents); and<br/>some tritonic intervals of precisely 600 cents.</p><p>&quot;Ah,&quot; you might say, &quot;this is likely some kind of paultone, with the<br/>shade of temperament a bit milder than Paul Erlich&apos;s beloved 22-EDO,<br/>where the minor sevenths at ~981.82 cents are a bit closer to 4:7, and<br/>the large major third a tad larger than a pure 7:9 at ~436.36 cents.&quot;<br/>Indeed you find fifths at ~708.38 cents, or ~6.42 cents wide, as<br/>compared to 13/22 octave at ~709.09 cents or ~7.14 cents wide.</p><p>However, exploring the keyboard, you soon find other intervals which<br/>don&apos;t fit this model, including some minor thirds at precisely 300<br/>cents, and major thirds at around 408 cents and 421 cents. Also, you<br/>find that the near-4:5 major thirds are around 383.24 cents, larger<br/>than would be expected in a paultone model (where nine fifths up at<br/>~708.38 cents each would yield an augmented second at ~375.42 cents).</p><p>You quickly confirm that this isn&apos;t a paultone -- at least not the<br/>whole tuning system -- but a circulating 12-note tuning with fifths at<br/>around 708.38 cents (as already noted) and 695.81 cents (~6.14 cents<br/>narrow). There are four fifths of the former size, and eight of the<br/>latter at F-C# -- each narrowed by 2/7 of a syntonic comma (81:80,<br/>~21.51 cents).</p><p>In other words, this is a temperament extraordinaire based on<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone, possibly one of the 12-note circulating<br/>systems with the widest ranges of third sizes, and the best<br/>approximations of 6:7, 7:9, and 4:7 (although not as good, at least<br/>overall, as in either a paultone near 22-EDO or a regular meantone).</p><p>As occurs also in a temperament extraordinaire based on 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, all fifths are tempered by almost the same absolute amount:<br/>here -6.14 cents or +6.42 cents; and in 1/4-comma, -5.38 cents or<br/>+4.88 cents. Thus the system is freely circulating as far as 3-limit<br/>harmony is concerned: each of the 12 steps has a reasonable<br/>approximation of 2:3:4, so that Gothic or neo-Gothic cadences on all<br/>steps are possible.</p><p>In either system, as in a temperament extraordinaire generally, eight<br/>fifths are tempered in regular meantone, and the others by equal<br/>amounts in the wide direction so as to produce two &quot;even-tones&quot; for<br/>the usual diminished fourth C#-F in a standard meantone with narrow<br/>fifths of the same size. Thus these even-tones are ~213.686 cents in a<br/>1/4-comma temperament extraordinaire (with C#-F at 25:32, ~427.373<br/>cents), and ~216.759 cents in the 2/7-comma version (with C#-F at<br/>~433.517 cents).</p><p>Interestingly, in the 2/7-comma scheme this even-tone is only ~0.072<br/>cents larger than a just 15:17 (~216.687 cents), so that Eb-F-G<br/>(~0-216.76-408.38 cents) gives a very close approximation of the<br/>isoharmonic sonority 15:17:19 (~0-216.69-409.24 cents), with all three<br/>intervals within one cent of just.</p><p>Here is a keyboard tuning diagram:</p><p>    25:24<br/>    70.672     287.431          574.862  779.052  995.810<br/>     C#          Eb               F#        G#       Bb<br/> C           D          E      F        G         A        B     C<br/> 0         191.621   383.241 504.190  695.810  887.431 1079.052 1200</p><p>Here is a Scala file:</p><p>! zarte84.scl<br/>!<br/>Temperament extraordinaire, Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone (F-C#)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 70.67243<br/> 191.62069<br/> 287.43104<br/> 383.24139<br/> 504.18965<br/> 574.86208<br/> 695.81035<br/> 779.05173<br/> 887.43104<br/> 995.81035<br/> 1079.05173<br/> 2/1</p><p>Among the set of 12-note circulating temperaments, the Zarlino-based<br/>temperament extraordinaire (or TE for short) might offer some of the<br/>most generous contrasts in semitone sizes, ranging from a just 24:25<br/>or ~70.672 cents (C-C#/Db, F-F#/Gb) to the regular diatonic semitone<br/>of 2/7-comma meantone at ~120.948 cents, a difference of ~50.276<br/>cents.</p><p>This 50.28-cent difference, equal to the enharmonic diesis in a<br/>regular 2/7-comma meantone tuning (e.g. G#-Ab), also defines the<br/>amount by which the largest major third or diminished fourth (C#/Db-F)<br/>at ~433.52 cents exceeds the smallest major thirds at their usual<br/>meantone size of ~383.24 cents. These thirds are close respectively to<br/>7:9 (~435.084 cents) and 4:5 (~386.314 cents), so that the difference<br/>is close to 36:35 (~48.770 cents).</p><p>One could achieve a 12-note circle with an even greater difference by<br/>choosing a slightly greater amount of temperament for the narrow<br/>meantone fifths, as for example in Ervin Wilson&apos;s metameantone tuning,<br/>with fifths at around 695.630 cents (~6.32 cents narrow). A TE based<br/>on this meantone would have four wide fifths producing even-tones of<br/>the virtually pure 7:9 diminished fourth or major third C#/Db-F at<br/>~434.96 cents, or only ~0.12 cents smaller than just -- in other<br/>words, fifths at ~708.74 cents, or ~6.78 cents wide, and even-tones at<br/>~217.48 cents, or very slightly wider than 17:15.</p><p>The Zarlino-based circle has the special attraction of being a system<br/>combining nine notes or eight fifths (F-C#) identical to those in the<br/>earliest Western European meantone temperament to be documented in<br/>precise mathematical terms (by Zarlino in 1558), and also such<br/>features as the near-7:9 third and just 24:25 semitones.</p><p>In the Zarlino-based TE, interval sizes jump by steps of ~12.57 cents,<br/>or 1/4 of the 50.28-cent diesis in 2/7-comma meantone. Thus we have,<br/>for example (using typical meantone spellings, although enharmonic<br/>equivalence here applies):</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>minor2 (can represent diatonic or chromatic semitone)</p><p>  ~70.672 cents (25:24) -- 2 -- C-C#, F-F#<br/>  ~83.241 cents         -- 2 -- Bb-B, G-G#<br/>  ~95.810 cents         -- 2 -- D-Eb, Eb-E<br/> ~108.379 cents         -- 2 -- G#-A, A-Bb<br/> ~120.948 cents         -- 4 -- C#-D, E-F, F#-G, B-C<br/>...................................................................<br/>Major2/diminished3</p><p> ~191.621 cents  -- 7 -- C-D, D-E, E-F#, F-G, G-A, A-B, B-C#<br/> ~204.190 cents  -- 2 -- F#-G#, Bb-C<br/> ~216.759 cents  -- 3 -- C#-Eb, Eb-F, G#-Bb<br/>...................................................................<br/>minor3/Augmented2</p><p> ~274.862 cents  -- 2 -- Eb-F#, Bb-C#<br/> ~287.431 cents  -- 2 -- C-Eb, F-G#<br/>  300.000 cents  -- 2 -- G-Bb, G#-B<br/> ~312.569 cents  -- 6 -- C#-E, D-F.

The upper minor<br/>third at ~287.431 cents, however, is a much better approximation of<br/>11:13 (~289.210 cents) or 28:33 (~284.447 cents) than 6:7 (~266.871<br/>cents).</p><p>Another somewhat paultone-style approximation of 4:5:6:7 (albeit with<br/>a diminished fifth equal to ~587.431 cents rather than 600 cents,<br/>actually closer to the ideal 5:7 at ~582.512 cents) is available at<br/>Bb-D-F-Ab (~0-396-708-983 cents). Here the best equivalents for 4:7<br/>and 6:7 (~274.862 cents, only about 0.280 cents larger than 64:75) are<br/>combined with a rather compromised ~4:5 at ~395.810 cents, or about<br/>9.497 cents wide). The wide ~2:3 is like that of a moderate paultone,<br/>as noted above, and a bit closer to pure (~6.415 cents wide) than in<br/>22-EDO (~7.136 cents wide).</p><p>From a neo-Gothic perspective, the 287-cent minor thirds are also very<br/>attractive along with the 421-cent and 408-cent major thirds, as well<br/>as the 434-cent major third very close to 7:9.</p><p>The 275-cent minor thirds at Bb-C#/Db and Eb-F#/Gb are near the low<br/>end of the range called &quot;Monzian&quot; in honor of Joe Monzo, running from<br/>around 64:75 (as here) to about 280 cents, as with the thirds at<br/>around 279.471 cents in a 1/4-comma meantone TE. The latter value<br/>represents the chosen size for a third at which Monz arrived in a<br/>certain composition through tuning by ear, while the former represents<br/>his choice of 64:75 as an appropriate rational value.</p><p>It is thus notable that the spectrum of TE systems from 1/4-comma to<br/>2/7-comma roughly represents the range of Monzian sizes for the<br/>smallest minor thirds in these 12-note circles.</p><p>It would go almost without saying that the 2/7-comma TE, like the<br/>1/4-comma TE, is quite different from a conventional 18th-century<br/>well-temperament, where at least marginally &quot;playable&quot; representations<br/>of 5-limit concords such as 4:5:6 or 10:12:15 are expected in all<br/>positions, with Pythagorean thirds at 64:81 (~407.820 cents) and 27:32<br/>(~294.135 cents) as rough limits. In such systems, typically, no fifth<br/>is wider than pure.</p><p>In these TE systems based on 16th-century meantones with optimal or<br/>near-optimal 5-limit sonorities, however, major and minor thirds<br/>beyond Pythagorean (in the large and small directions respectively)<br/>are a main attraction, along with impeccable with Renaissance meantone<br/>sonorities in the range of F-C#. The wide fifths are desirable for<br/>neo-medieval progressions, just as the narrow ones are for usual<br/>Renaissance progressions. Consider, for example, this cadence:</p><p>        Bb4/A#4        C5/B#4<br/>        Ab4/G#4        G4/Fx4<br/>        F4/E#4         G4/Fx4<br/>        Db4/C#4        C4/B#3</p><p>   (0-434-708-925)   (0-696-1200)</p><p>Here we have a ~14:18:21:24 sonority (as it might be described) with<br/>descending semitones of 24:25 (Db4-C4) and ~83.241 cents (Ab4-G4). The<br/>ascending whole-tone F4-G4 is the usual 2/7-comma mean-tone of<br/>~191.621 cents, while Bb4-C5 is at ~204.190 cents, only ~0.28 cents<br/>wider than a just 8:9 (~203.910 cents).</p><p>It is fascinating to explore such a 12-note circle, identical to<br/>2/7-comma meantone in nine of its steps and eight of its fifths, but<br/>quite different from a typical European historical system in its total<br/>effect if one uses a variety of intervals from all portions of the<br/>circle.</p><p>It would also be interesting to investigate the widest major third<br/>specified in an historical temperament ordinaire (TO): the<br/>433.517-cent third at C#/Db-F in this TE might be one of the wider<br/>ones on record for a circulating 12-note system.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=43022 href="#43022">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2003 12:43:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
