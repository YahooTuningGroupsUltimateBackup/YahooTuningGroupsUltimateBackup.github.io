Sims neither comes from the traditon of<br/>those like Alois Haba or Julian Carrillo, who expanded upon the model of the<br/>equal-tempered scale with their microtonal chromatics, nor belongs properly<br/>with the just intonation school and its very strict adherence to principles<br/>based upon &quot;acoustical fact.&quot; Independently, he has used natural phenomena<br/>as spring-boards for ideas, while at the same time always making artistic<br/>choices based on musical instinct. His music expands the tonal concept, so<br/>that the essential driving forces of tonality -- such as the powerful draw<br/>of the fundamental tone -- are maintained, while the harmonic palate is<br/>enriched far beyond the triad with higher overtone relationships. The first<br/>months of 1998 have seen, in addition to the composer&apos;s seventieth birthday<br/>in January, performances of new and old works in various U.S. cities, and<br/>the re-release on CD (CRI of three works of his from the 60s and 70s. (See<br/>end of article for details about CD and upcoming performances.) The<br/>concurrence of these events naturally prompts reflection from his audience<br/>about where microtonalism has taken Sims, and speculation about where it is<br/>leading him now. In his early twenties, Sims began hearing different<br/>ivervallic relationships from the ones provided by the equal-tempered<br/>twelve-note system, but it took him some time first to comprehend the nature<br/>of what he was hearing and then to devise an organized way to integrate the<br/>new intervals with his music. In fact, his first reaction was to regard the<br/>perceived pitches as intruders and to try to ignore orwork around them. At<br/>the time he was writing his String Quartet (1959), his use of the semitone E<br/>to F consistently compelled his ear to invent a third pitch somewhere<br/>in-between the E and F one octave above. Although he did make use of some<br/>microtonal clusters at the end of the piece, Sims ignored the intruding<br/>pitch. Only in his early thirties did Sims finally decide to devote his<br/>attention to the specific and persistent intervals that his ear invented and<br/>use microtones systematically in his compositions. His first explorations in<br/>the early 1960s involved the use of quarter-tones. While these pursuits<br/>produced some satisfying pieces (most notably his Third Quartet (1962)),<br/>they ultimately led the composer to dead ends in his search to satisfy his<br/>ears. He found that performers had difficulty playing quarter-tone music<br/>accurately and that listeners in general did not respond favorably to it.<br/>More importantly, as he paid ever closer attention he realized that he was<br/>hearing a quasi-diatonic scale of some kind that included third-tones and<br/>five-twelfths-tones, as well as quarter-tones. He understoon that this<br/>implied a total division of the octave into seventy-two equal-tempered<br/>intervals. After gradually accumulating bits of information about the<br/>physics of sound, Sims began to notice that it was possible to explain his<br/>pitches in light of two acoustical phenomena: the overtone series and<br/>resultant tones. The overtone series, some of whose intervals differ<br/>dramatically from the twelve equal-tempered ones, was a well-known<br/>phenomenon that composers had employed for years as a harmonic model for<br/>just intonation. Less commonly considered by composers were resultant tones.<br/>These secondary pitches are perceived (though they do not actually<br/>reverberate as do overtones) when two pitches are sounding simultaneously.<br/>The frequency of the resultnat pitch is either the sum of the other two<br/>pitches, in which case it is higher (a &quot;summation&quot; tone), or the difference,<br/>in which case it is lower (a &quot;differential&quot; tone). These revelations enabled<br/>Sims finally to understand the apparent cause of what he heard. For example,<br/>the third-, five-twelfths- and quarter-tone &quot;inflections&quot; that he felt<br/>inclined to use reflected the differences that the fifth, seventh, and<br/>eleventh harmonics have from their counterparts in the equal- tempered<br/>system, and the intruding pitch in the 1959 String Quartet could now easily<br/>be explained as the summation tone of E and F. The new understanding also<br/>helped Sims to see additional harmonic and structural implications. The<br/>equal-tempered 72-note chromatic scale allowed very close approximations to<br/>the natural intervals, and with it he began gradually to develop an<br/>asymmetrical, transposable microtonal scale whose tones are derived from the<br/>overtone series (Example 1a-b). By 1970, Sims had the basic scale in place,<br/>although the most elaborate form, shown in Example 1c, wasn&apos;t crystallized<br/>until around 1979. Open noteheads indicate more stable pitches with the<br/>fundamental C, drawn from the lower harmonics, 1-16. Filled noteheads are<br/>less stable, more remote harmonics and complex ratios. The sixth-low F,<br/>shown with a stem, is added so that G, the third harmonic, may also have a<br/>seventh. Unlike many composers using just intonation, Sims has been quite<br/>idiosyncratic and unscientific in his use of the overtone model, and perhaps<br/>more artistic for that reason. This can be seen in the construction of the<br/>scale as well as in his compositional techniques. For example, the first<br/>seven tones of his scale are derived from the intervals between the twelfth<br/>and the fifteenth harmonics, two two-thirds-tones -- which he then, for<br/>convenience, splits into third-tones - but uses other pitches than the<br/>actualharmonics over C. (Those are G, sixth-tone low A-flat, sixth tone high<br/>A-flat, A, etc. that appear higher up in the scale.) These members of hte<br/>sclae, therefore, while derived loosely from the overtone series would not<br/>be consonant whenused in combination wit hteh fundamental C and its<br/>overtones. The implication of such usage is that the overtone series simply<br/>offers Sims a prototype for various interval sizes. It does not determine<br/>the absolute hierarchy of intervallic relationships or the degree of<br/>consonance or dissonance as in most contemporary just intonation systems.<br/>Sims&apos;s use of the harmonics in composition is also quite free. Having set up<br/>the parameters with the notes of his scale, Sims is then comfortable<br/>trusting that his ear, his intuition, and his intellect together will make<br/>good choices, both locally, in the harmonies, and on a large scale, with the<br/>sucession of pitch regions. With his harmonies he often omits or<br/>de-emphasizes the fundamental itself, preferring instead various<br/>arrangements of the higher, derived pitches. In Example 2, for instance,<br/>measure 5 contains notes in a cluster that are harmonics of a twelfth-low<br/>F-sharp, and therefore will &quot;belong&quot; together, even though F-sharp itself is<br/>not present. (The sixth-tone-high D-sharp in the upper line of the tape part<br/>is an anticipation into the next measure.) On a larger sclae, series of<br/>scale tones are usually selected that will serve as regions throughout the<br/>piece, and transpositions of the scale to those degreees are used for each<br/>modulation (even if the fundamental pitch itself is not used, but merely<br/>implied). This, too, can be seen in Example 2, where measures 1-3 use notes<br/>derived from the scale on a fundamental of D, measure 4, from the same scale<br/>built on E (9/8 of D), measure 5 from the scale on twelfth-low F-sharp (5/4<br/>of D), and so on. Again, this type of root movement arises from the<br/>composer&apos;s logic and his requirements at that moment in the piece, rather<br/>than from some obvious scientific model intended to reflect the natural<br/>sequence of the overtone pitches. The knowledge and perception of resultant<br/>tones also have helped inform some of Sims&apos;s harmonic choices. In the<br/>opening of the slow movement of his Quintet (1987) for clarinet and strings,<br/>for example, the clarinet is given a sixth-tone-high B-flat , the summation<br/>ton of the B and the F in the second violin and cello (see Example 3). The<br/>clarinet holds its F through shifting tones in the other voices and into the<br/>moment when the cello, returning to its B, and the clarinet, now with a<br/>quarter-tone-low B-flat, begin to demand an E from the middle voice in order<br/>for all three voices to attain stability. (B and E produce a summation tone<br/>of quarter-tone-low B-flat.) Thus the F functions first as a sort of<br/>consonance, then as a pedal, and finally as a suspension that resolves to a<br/>new consonant tone, E. Sims has written a good deal of vocal music, and has<br/>always been compelled to explore the relationship between speech and melody<br/>in his music. His recent piece If I Told Him (1996) for alto and cello, is<br/>based on a recording of Gertrude Stein reciting her poem of the same title.<br/>The subtle inflections of her almost chant-like recitation had some effect<br/>on Sims&apos;s techniques, with implications that will perhaps extent beyond that<br/>piece. These have to do with the shift from region to region. Formerly, such<br/>prgressions were carried out, abruptly, as can be seen in Example 2, with<br/>the aid of common tones. Now Sims seems to favor more gradual, intricate<br/>chromatic shifts, sometimes involving a harmonic no-man&apos;s land in between<br/>regions. This appears to be a further abstraction of the natural harmonci<br/>model and further expression fo hte composer&apos;s will over science. Notes<br/>Sims&apos;s piece If I Told Him (1996), for alto and cello, will be performed<br/>twice in March: first on 9 March at the Music at the Edge concert series in<br/>Pittsburg, and then at Merkin Concert Hall in NYC on 12 March. It will be<br/>played again at the Ijsbreker Music Center in Amsterdam on 28 May.

What I personally find very interesting in all this<br/>is that at the time when I lived close to the Maneris (and was<br/>basically there at their house every other day or so for a couple of<br/>years), there was only a single, locally produced CD, &quot;Kavalinka&quot; --<br/>and this was not for any lack of performing or recording (in fact most<br/>all their early Quartet records had already been recorded at that<br/>point) -- but now, just a relatively few years later, they have really<br/>acquired quite an international reputation and have over a dozen<br/>CDs... I for one am very happy to see this has happened and feel it is<br/>well deserved, though based on what was already a lifetime committed<br/>to music (Joe was 67 when &quot;Get Ready to Receive Yourself&quot; was released<br/>and things started to take off) I am somewhat amazed that it happened<br/>at all - better late than never though!</p><p>&gt;After hearing two of Maneri&apos;s cds, I was struck by a comparison with<br/>the playing of the late clarinetist, John Carter.</p><p>While I really do like your John Carter comparison in as much as Joe&apos;s<br/>alto and tenor playing (and the majority of the Maneris music) could<br/>certainly be said to be effusive and at the same time &quot;models of<br/>clarity,&quot; I really don&apos;t think they sound *at all* alike. Also Joe&apos;s<br/>clarinet playing is almost always his most idiomatic, and when his<br/>groups music sounds anything klezmeresque, or something like a<br/>spiritual, etc., it will inevitably be when he is playing the<br/>clarinet...</p><p>&gt;This is only speculation on my part, but the more abundant musicality<br/>of Carter&apos;s playing make me regret that we don&apos;t have a &quot;respected<br/>textbook&quot; on microtonality from his pen.</p><p>Well sure, I agree that more *players* of that caliber actively<br/>involved in microtonality would truly be wonderful, and I also like<br/>Carter&apos;s music as well (and a lot of those other West Coast guys as<br/>well, like Tim Berne and Vinny Golia), but here&apos;s to hoping that<br/>&quot;abundant musicality&quot; is a subjective entity! Anyway, as I said<br/>before, the &quot;encyclopedic knowledge of microtonal music&quot; soundbite<br/>type quip is somewhat typical of the types of distortions reviewers<br/>(etc.) make, and not something (thankfully) that I could see Joe<br/>saying of himself - perhaps I should have mentioned something like<br/>that when I posted it. Joe&apos;s strong points are as far as I&apos;m concerned<br/>are his absolutely remarkable ear and technique, and most importantly,<br/>his ability to translate that into an ever-growing body of very<br/>personal music that doesn&apos;t offer a lot of easy answers (in other<br/>words he has a phenomenal ear and technique, yet his music almost<br/>always subverts and reroutes your expectations of what someone with<br/>phenomenal chops should sound like, etc.). Also -- and very much<br/>unlike Carter or Metheny (whom I only mention because I just noticed<br/>that he popped up in a different post as I was writing this one) --<br/>Joe&apos;s playing is *always* very much microtonal, and it&apos;s a real<br/>seamless, organic component of his music.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=9157 href="#9157">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/8/2000 8:40:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe Maneri, Harold Seletsky and I improvised together one evening at La Mama<br/>La Galleria on East 2nd Street in Manhattan, just around the corner from<br/>CBGBs and across the street from dogs inside a gate.

Also, in my view, you really nailed<br/>the positive aspects as well as the possible drawbacks of the Maneri<br/>72 method in your post:</p><p>&quot;Former students trained to the 72TET continuum may still need to<br/>learn where the just intervals are.  As<br/>such, it does provide impediment to a universal approach to tuning.<br/>To its credit, it maps a huge territory of sensible intervalic<br/>relationships, and informs an active and enthusiastic community of<br/>practicing microtonalists.</p><p>In New York there are several graduates of Joe Maneri&apos;s teachings<br/>living here (Giusto, Borden, Washburne, Fusczinski, Mat Maneri).  Each<br/>has a leg up in navigating the microtonal worlds of different tunings,<br/>even if each tuning has to be apprehended afresh (for it is not<br/>precisely found in 72TET).&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div>
