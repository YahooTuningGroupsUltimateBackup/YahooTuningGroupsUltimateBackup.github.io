As an example of what _not_ to do, an earlier notation I used was based on a 12-note keyboard mapping:</p><p>D F A C D# F# A# C# E G B</p><p>That&apos;s fine if you happen to have your keyboard mapped that way, but it&apos;s not apparent how this could be extended to larger scales.</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 8:36:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 1/19/06, wallyesterpaulrus &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there an existing notation system for the Hanson or Keemun<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments (octave period, generated by 6/5 minor thirds)?
