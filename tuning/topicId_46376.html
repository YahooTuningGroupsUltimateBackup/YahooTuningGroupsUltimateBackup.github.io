The ones i<br/>already have are gonna stay the way they are! Anyway, here you can see<br/>pictures of the end results, if its not currently disabled for using<br/>too much bandwidth:</p><p><a href="http://enakasse.tripod.com/balalaika.html">http://enakasse.tripod.com/balalaika.html</a></p><p>And no they aren&apos;t actually purple, that&apos;s an artifact of the webcam<br/>with certain surfaces that i&apos;m trying to avoid getting. The soprano is<br/>truly ugly though, both the &quot;sunburst waves&quot; on the back and the top<br/>after i tried to replace some of the pre-printed graphic patterns with<br/>my own design, but the old one wouldn&apos;t disappear completely. It does<br/>play well enough after all the adjustment i did to it (including<br/>making a new bridge) but the sound is very weak and dull, due to the<br/>plastic back and cheap construction.</p><p>The alto sounds really good though, and it was also easier to work on<br/>because the wood used for the neck/fingerboard was so much better and<br/>wouldn&apos;t splinter as easily. I could go on for long about the mistakes<br/>and fixes i had to make during the fretting, but that doesn&apos;t matter.<br/>And now to the point, the tuning.</p><p>Theoretically they are fretted for 19-equal, but it actually<br/>approximates anything from 16 to 20-equal by moving the bridge and<br/>retuning the strings accordingly. Actually so far i don&apos;t enjoy<br/>playing in 19 that much as 17, maybe because it is somewhat more<br/>&quot;familiar&quot; to finger as the semitones are single fret steps. Also it&apos;s<br/>good for melodies without many chords, which is what is played on the<br/>Balalaika anyway.</p><p>I&apos;m gonna try to do some recording soon, but i already have a couple<br/>of other axes i haven&apos;t recorded anything with (steel string 12-tet<br/>soprano Balalaika especially) so that might take some time. Anyway,<br/>any comments and suggestions are welcome...</p><p>/Mats &Ouml;ljare</p></div>
