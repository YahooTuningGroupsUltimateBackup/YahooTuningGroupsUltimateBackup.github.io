I wish I could be there.</p><p>You should know that George Secor and I have taken your claims very<br/>seriously in our sagittal notation-system effort. We have not allowed<br/>any approximation greater than a cent, and many are less than half a<br/>cent. And in fact there is no approximation at all until one goes<br/>beyond 11-odd-limit in the single-symbol and double-symbol forms of<br/>the notation, or beyond the 31-prime-limit in the multi-symbol form.</p><p>I hope that someone can make a recording of your demonstration for the<br/>purpose of measuring the pitch changes and reporting back to the list.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello listers!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Remember we had a fuss here on the list concerning the ability to<br/>hear and<br/>&gt; sing and play a cent distinction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the time I found it extremely frustrating that readers could not be<br/>&gt; satisfied by correspondence over the internet.
