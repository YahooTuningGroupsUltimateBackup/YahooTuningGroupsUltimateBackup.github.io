Yes, that certainly is a correct Sagittal notation for a chain of generators in 11-limit porcupine temperament. There is no standard notation for that as yet.</p><p>Although I would write it in text as<br/>... C# D#\|/ E/|\ F# G#\|/ A/|\ B C#\|/ D/|\ E ...</p><p>Of course, on the staff the order is reversed, but the constant is that the accidental representing the greatest alteration is always nearest the nominal/notehead.</p><p>In text we can also use the short form<br/>... C# D#v E^ F# G#v A^ B C#v D^ E ...</p><p>and, as usual, we require fewer accidentals if we go closer to centering on D<br/>... D^ E F#v G^ A Bv C^ D Ev F^ G Av Bb^ C Dv ...</p><p>The 5-limit notation (similar to the standard 22-ET notation) is equally valid<br/>...
