Chapters 4, 5, and 6, covers much of what has been discussed on this list lately -- including the importance of a vanishing 81:80 in common-practice Western music, schismic thirds in 15th century Pythagorean Gb-B tuning, the unexpected prominence of cubic difference tones at low volumes, and periodicity blocks and unison vectors. I suggest everyone print out a copy and keep it for reference.

Mozart taught string players to use meantone intonation<br/>(probably close to 1/6-comma), and 1/4-comma meantone for organs<br/>persisted in England and Spain through about 1850.</p><p>&gt; And why did Bach restrict<br/>&gt; his inventions to the keys normally available in the meantone<br/>&gt; variants if he never used temperaments other than Werckmeister?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure, but I think the evidence is that in Bach&apos;s geographic<br/>region, Werckmeister III or something like it was already entrenched<br/>during Bach&apos;s youth. If you want to see a composer whose output<br/>transitions from meantone to well-tempered, look to Buxtehude.</p></div><h3><a id=28964 href="#28964">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2001 2:28:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt; This post brings up a question I&apos;ve had for awhile now.
