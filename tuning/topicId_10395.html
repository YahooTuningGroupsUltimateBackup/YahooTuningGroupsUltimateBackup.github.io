For example, if<br/>complexity of the ratio n/d in lowest terms is defined as n (as we&apos;ve seen<br/>-- &quot;the Farey series&quot;), then width is predicted by 1/d. If complexity is<br/>defined as n^2 + d^2, then width is predicted by sqrt(1/n^2 + 1/d^2).</p><p>But for the Tenney harmonic distance n*d, the width is predicted by<br/>1/sqrt(n*d), which is a function of the Tenney harmonic distance! In<br/>particular, if one takes all ratios n/d such that n*d&lt;T (harmonic distance<br/>is less than T), then the width of each ratio will be between 1/sqrt(n*d*T)<br/>and 2/(sqrt(n*d*T), with the widths of the relatively simple ratios tending<br/>to be very close to the latter.</p><p>So in a sense, the Tenney harmonic distance (or any monotonic function<br/>thereof) is the only self-consistent complexity measure for dyads (that I<br/>know of). In fact, the factor of 2 above could be increased to any finite<br/>number and still none of the other complexity functions I know of would<br/>qualify.</p></div>
