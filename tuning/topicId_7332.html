I just do<br/>&gt;&gt; my best to sing in tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, OK, sorry to label you without your approval... but<br/>&gt;as far as anyone on this List (except maybe Johnny Reinhard)<br/>&gt;is concerned, your efforts to &apos;sing in tune&apos; automatically<br/>&gt;make you a microtonalist/xenharmonicist/whatever-you-call-it,<br/>&gt;because you *sure* aren&apos;t singing in 12-tET/12-EDO!</p><p>No offense taken. I took your post as an opportunity to express my views<br/>about the terms. For myself, I don&apos;t find the terms &quot;microtonal&quot; or<br/>&quot;xenharmonic&quot; particularly useful, in that I&apos;ve been involved in plenty of<br/>discussions about music both on this list and elsewhere (on the phone, or<br/>even face to face), and have never used the terms except to ask what they<br/>mean. I&apos;m open to changing my mind on this issue if anyone can show how the<br/>terms are needed in a lerger theoretical framework. The responses on this<br/>list to my questions about the meaning of the terms suggests that there is<br/>no consensus. With regard to Johnny Reinhard, I thought he said that ALL<br/>music is microtonal.</p><p>Back to work on the CD...</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div>
