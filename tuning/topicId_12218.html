Dan, you had better place<br/>cotton in your ears, since we are now going to discuss a comparison<br/>between ISOLATED chords.  I wouldn&apos;t want to &quot;pollute&quot; your<br/>syntactical sensitivities...</p><p>Well.. I should also mention that the &quot;error&quot; in these files... I<br/>don&apos;t know who made it, but he seems to be typing even right<br/>now...has been remedied, and these chords are now, fortunately, what<br/>they are labeled...</p><p>OH... I have yet ANOTHER caveat!  These perceptions are based upon my<br/>results with &quot;Lo Fi&quot; Play... this evening with a 56K modem. I get<br/>slightly different results at work with a T1 line and &quot;Hi Fi,&quot; but<br/>not much... so I will write about those specifics later.</p><p>PERCEPTIONS:</p><p>The just &quot;dominant seventh&quot; chord 4:5:6:7 seems very smooth with no<br/>beating.</p><p>The 22-tET &quot;version&quot; of this chord has audible beating... I&apos;m hearing<br/>on this equipment about 3 beats per second.</p><p>AND, the dominant seventh chord of 12-tET beats even more... I&apos;m<br/>hearing about 7 beats per second.</p><p>All in all, the distinctions between these dominant seventh chords,<br/>for me, seem a matter of degree of clearly audible, and even<br/>&quot;countable&quot; beating...</p><p>NOW DOWN TO THE UTONAL:</p><p>The JI version of 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 makes a smooth half-diminished<br/>seventh chord.  However it really does NOT sound exactly like an<br/>otonal 5:6:7:9 (sorry! we first had the wrong file!) There is a<br/>little &quot;wobbly&quot; characteristic to it that the otonal chord does not<br/>have! They are surely NOT identical...</p><p>The 22-tET version of 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 has MORE beating... I&apos;m<br/>counting about 5 beats per second...</p><p>NOW THE OTONAL-UTONAL COMPARISON:</p><p>As I mentioned, the 5:6:7:9 half-diminished seventh has a &quot;smoother&quot;<br/>sound than the utonal 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4.  It has an &quot;integrated&quot; nature<br/>that compares it more to the otonal 4:5:6:7 for me... even though<br/>they are different chords...</p><p>The 22-tET version of &quot;5:6:7:9&quot; has, typically, more beating than the<br/>just.  I&apos;m counting about 2 beats per second perception for this<br/>chord...</p><p>FINALLY... the half-diminished seventh chord in 12-tET seems to be<br/>beating about 1 beat per second.  In this sense, it is neither like<br/>the just otonal half-diminished seventh, which has little beating, OR<br/>the utonal 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4... which doesn&apos;t really BEAT in a timable<br/>fashion, but which has a certain &quot;wobble&quot; to it that is different<br/>from the otonal perception.</p><p>Other people getting similar reactions??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>__________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
