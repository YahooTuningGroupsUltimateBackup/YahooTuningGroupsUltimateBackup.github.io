He<br/>offers an adaptively tuned version of my JI sequence based on current<br/>methods, and suggests some possible further developments.</p><p>For my part, I&apos;ll explain a bit about the musical background of my JI<br/>example, and also some of the melodic features which John called to my<br/>attention.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>1. Sequence for a JI circumambulation<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>Around the end of May, I was excitedly immersed in two musical<br/>currents. The first was a JI system with two 12-note Pythagorean<br/>manuals tuned a pure 7:6 apart, which I named Sesquisexta after the<br/>medieval Latin term for this ratio (&quot;and again a sixth&quot;). For people<br/>who may be interested in this tuning, here is a link to a Scala file:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesquisx.scl">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesquisx.scl</a></p><p>The second current was my discovery of the EXAMPLE command in Scala<br/>version 1.41 for MS-DOS, Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s outstanding free program<br/>for scale design and analysis, which can take a text file defining an<br/>example or musical composition along with a specified Scala scale file<br/>and produce a MIDI file with pitchbend messages.</p><p>These currents reached their confluence when I came across an<br/>interesting form of JI &quot;circumambulation&quot; in the Sesquisexta tuning<br/>and decided to use Scala to create a MIDI sequence which could be<br/>shared with others.</p><p>One of the special features of Sesquisexta is that in addition to the<br/>usual Pythagorean intervals available on either manual, there are no<br/>less than 11 pure sonorities of 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 available<br/>by mixing notes from the two manuals.[1] Counting these two related<br/>forms separately, we have 22 such &quot;7-flavor&quot; sonorities to choose from<br/>(featuring just ratios of 9:7, 7:6, 12:7, 7:4, or 8:7).</p><p>One idea that occurred to me was a &quot;circumambulation&quot; through a<br/>sequence of six _almost_ identical cadences, for example with unstable<br/>12:14:18:21 sonorities resolving to stable fifths. Here I&apos;ll give such<br/>a sequence in a notation with C4 as middle C, and a &quot;v&quot; symbol to show<br/>a note a septimal comma (64:63, ~27.26 cents) lower than the usual<br/>Pythagorean degree:</p><p>Bb3  Dbv4  C4  Ebv4  D4  Fv4   E4  Gv4  F#4 Av4  G#4  Bv4  Bb4<br/>Bb3        C4        D4        E4       F#4      G#4       Bb4<br/>Eb3  Gbv3  F3  Abv3  G3  Bbv3  A3  Cv4  B3  Dv4  C#4  Ev4  Eb4<br/>Eb3        F3        G3        A3       B3       C#4       Eb4</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>In this type of circumambulation we start at the fifth Eb3-Bb3, and<br/>conclude an octave higher at Eb4-Bb4, with the lowest voice moving<br/>through a &quot;circle&quot; -- or better &quot;near-circle&quot; -- of six whole-tone<br/>steps: Eb3-F3-G3-A3-B3-C#4-Eb4.</p><p>As the spelling may suggest, the first five steps are in fact<br/>identical whole-tones at the usual 9:8 (~203.91 cents), but the last<br/>step C#4-Eb4 is actually a diminished third at the rather complex<br/>ratio of 65536:59049 (~180.45 cents), a Pythagorean comma smaller than<br/>the others (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents).</p><p>For me, the main musical issue was: what effect might this melodic<br/>unevenness have on the overall progression? Listening at the keyboard,<br/>I found that it gave me no problem at all -- but then, I&apos;m accustomed<br/>to comma shifts of various kinds, especially those involving a<br/>septimal comma or some interval serving a similar role in a tempered<br/>system.</p><p>An historical bonus for me was that this sequence made the<br/>Pythagorean comma a kind of poetry in motion, as I&apos;ll explain in a<br/>footnote for those curious, demonstrating two &quot;unusual&quot; intervals<br/>described around 1325 by the great medieval European theorist Jacobus<br/>of Liege.[2]</p><p>Apart from this &quot;creative asymmetry&quot; introduced by the Pythagorean<br/>comma at the conclusion of the progression[3], I didn&apos;t notice any<br/>other special issues.</p><p>From another historical viewpoint, by the way, I looked at this<br/>sequence as a kind of homage to Claude Debussy and his use of the<br/>whole-tone scale around 1900, a century ago. The idea of an equivalent<br/>scale in Pythagorean-based JI (e.g. Eb-F-G-A-B-C#-Eb), complete with a<br/>touch of JI &quot;unevenness,&quot; really appealed to me. I was tempted to<br/>describe the effect as &quot;Impressionistic,&quot; maybe almost &quot;panmodal.&quot;</p><p>At this point, I found it both natural and easy with Scala&apos;s help to<br/>produce a MIDI file for sharing with John deLaubenfels, master of<br/>adaptive tuning and also a known connoisseur of septimal sonorities<br/>such as 12:14:18:21.</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>2. John&apos;s response: looking at things diagonally<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>When I eagerly sent my MIDI file to John, my guess was that the<br/>Pythagorean comma adjustments might be the main adaptive tuning<br/>question. The news I got back was at once very encouraging, and most<br/>intriguing from an analytical standpoint.</p><p>John found that none of the adjustments bothered his ear, an opinion<br/>with special significance coming from someone with much experience in<br/>hearing and weighing such fine points of intonation.</p><p>This, then -- at least as far as John and I were concerned -- was one<br/>case where JI using pure vertical sonorities and rational intervals<br/>only could succeed in very practical musical terms.</p><p>Having shared his verdict on the musical effect, however, John didn&apos;t<br/>stop there: he noted some features of the sequence which I hadn&apos;t even<br/>noticed, raising questions both for microtonal theory and for future<br/>adaptive tuning algorithms.</p><p>While I had been focusing on the Pythagorean comma, John pointed out a<br/>more pervasive issue which caused no problem in listening but raised<br/>some issues for theory: the use in this example of lots of notes a<br/>septimal comma apart.</p><p>Since the septimal comma of 64:63 didn&apos;t occur as a _direct_ melodic<br/>step, I hadn&apos;t considered the more subtle matter of notes in different<br/>voices and in relatively close musical proximity. As soon as I<br/>diagrammed the piece, however, John&apos;s point became perfectly evident.</p><p>Here, for example, are the highest and lowest voices, with &quot;+&quot; signs<br/>used to connect notes a septimal comma apart -- or, more precisely, an<br/>octave less a septimal comma:</p><p>Bb3  Dbv4  C4  Ebv4  D4  Fv4   E4  Gv4  F#4  Av4  G#4  Bv4  Bb4<br/>                +         +        +         +         +<br/>            +         +         +         +         +<br/>        +         +          +         +         +<br/>    +          +          +         +        +<br/> +         +          +         +        +<br/>Eb3        F3        G3        A3       B3        C#4       Eb4</p><p>Since John couldn&apos;t hear anything &quot;wrong,&quot; this example raised for him<br/>an interesting question: how much might the ear accept &quot;different<br/>scale degrees which are a small fraction of a semitone apart.&quot;[4]</p><p>Here, for example, degrees such as Eb3 and Ebv4 are a septimal comma<br/>apart, around 27 cents, or a bit more than 1/8-tone. More generally,<br/>this presence of two &quot;versions of the same basic note&quot; is a feature of<br/>various JI systems, and also of many regular temperaments when carried<br/>to enough notes to generate small &quot;commalike&quot; intervals.</p><p>As the last diagram suggests, this kind of relation between notes in<br/>two separate voices might be described as &quot;diagonal,&quot; involving<br/>different voices (the vertical dimension) at different points in time<br/>(the horizontal dimension).</p><p>John also took note of another kind of curious relation which didn&apos;t<br/>have any audible impact on him as a listener: the presence within a<br/>single melodic line of scale degrees at the interval of a fifth a<br/>septimal comma smaller than pure. As I then found, there were also<br/>fourths of this kind a comma smaller than pure.</p><p>Here, for example, are the narrow fifths formed by notes in the<br/>highest voice, with ratios of 189:128 (~674.69 cents):</p><p>Bb3  Dbv4  C4  Ebv4  D4  Fv4   E4  Gv4  F#4  Av4  G#4  Bv4  Bb4<br/>|-------------------------|<br/>           |------------------------|<br/>                     |------------------------|<br/>                               |------------------------|</p><p>Here are the narrow fourths formed by notes in the same voice, with<br/>ratios of 21:16 (~470.78 cents):</p><p>Bb3  Dbv4  C4  Ebv4  D4  Fv4   E4  Gv4  F#4  Av4  G#4  Bv4  Bb4<br/>|---------------|<br/>           |--------------|<br/>                     |--------------|<br/>                               |-------------|<br/>                                        |---------------|</p><p>These diagonal and indirect melodic intervals involving the septimal<br/>comma were something which had escaped my notice -- until I read<br/>John&apos;s analysis, to which he brought his musician&apos;s ear and theorist&apos;s<br/>insight.</p><p>From my perspective, John&apos;s feedback at once lent me much<br/>encouragement in exploring this kind of JI progression, and enriched<br/>my understanding of some of the subtle relationships involved.</p><p>At the same time, I was delighted to have shared an example which<br/>might have some significant ramifications for adaptive tuning<br/>theory. As John wrote:</p><p>           &quot;[I]t is in my mind a very open question how<br/>            much the ear will accept different scale degrees<br/>            which are a small fraction of a semitone apart.<br/>            Your sequence would seem to suggest, &grave;quite<br/>            a lot!&apos;&quot;[5]</p><p>In his related article, John focuses on this kind of question,<br/>considering not only what an adaptive tuning program might ideally<br/>seek to model, but some of the complications in implementing<br/>&quot;real-world&quot; algorithms more closely approximating such an ideal.[6]</p><p>For people interested in comparing my original JI sequence with John&apos;s<br/>adaptive tuning version, here are links to both MIDI files:</p><p>original JI version: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid</a>&gt;<br/>John&apos;s adaptive tuning: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesciat1.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesciat1.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Please let me conclude by thanking John, and also Manuel Op de Coul,<br/>for their most patient and friendly assistance in helping me get<br/>started with Scala&apos;s EXAMPLE feature, showing once again the<br/>generosity and mutual aid so often exemplified by members of our<br/>tuning community.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. The 12:14:18:21 sonority is a rounded 0-267-702-969 cents; and<br/>the 14:18:21:24 a rounded 0-435-702-933 cents.</p><p>2. This may be easiest to explain using rounded numbers. The first<br/>five ascending whole-tones in the lowest part, Eb-F-G-A-B-C#, at<br/>around 204 cents each, add up to 1020 cents, an interval (Eb-C#) which<br/>Jacobus calls the _pentatonus_ (&quot;five whole-tones&quot;), and might also<br/>be termed a Pythagorean augmented sixth. Taking the 1200-cent octave<br/>Eb3-Eb4 and subtracting this interval Eb3-C#4 of about 1020 cents, we<br/>have left about 180 cents for the remaining step C#4-Eb4. Jacobus<br/>terms this the _tonus minor_ or &quot;small tone,&quot; more precisely at a<br/>ratio of 65536:59049 (~180.45 cents). As Jacobus points out, six pure<br/>9:8 whole-tones would produce not a 2:1 octave but a _hexatonus_ at<br/>the ratio of 531441:262144 (~1023.46 cents). In rounded terms, six<br/>whole-tones at 204 cents each are equal to about 1224 cents --<br/>exceeding a pure octave by around 24 cents, the Pythagorean comma, or<br/>more precisely ~23.46 cents.</p><p>3. For the faster-moving voices, the highest and third-highest, the<br/>Pythagorean comma adjustment at the end of the progression introduces<br/>another &quot;unusual&quot; interval. These voices otherwise share a pattern of<br/>ascending by a pure 7:6 minor third and then descending by a 28:27<br/>semitone (~62.96 cents), two motions adding up to ascend by a 9:8<br/>whole-tone, e.g. Bb3-Dbv4-C4-Ebv4-D4-Fv4-E4-Gv4-F#4-Av4-G#4-Bv4-Bb4 in<br/>the highest voice. However, the last descending interval Bv4-Bb4 is<br/>actually a Pythagorean comma larger than 28:27, or 137781:131072<br/>(~86.42 cents). This interval is just slightly smaller than the usual<br/>Pythagorean diatonic semitone or limma at 256:243 (~90.22 cents), the<br/>difference being equal to the &quot;3-7 schisma&quot; or amount by which the<br/>septimal comma exceeds the Pythagorean comma, ~3.80 cents (an integer<br/>ratio of 33554432:33480783).</p><p>4. John deLaubenfels, personal communication.</p><p>5. Ibid.</p><p>6. Of course, there is the additional complication that different<br/>listeners may vary widely in their tolerance of -- or positive liking<br/>for -- various kinds of &quot;small interval&quot; shifts and relationships in<br/>JI or similar systems. One approach might be an adaptive tuning<br/>application with &quot;User Preferences&quot; to vary such parameters to taste.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 7:21:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;<br/>MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;As John wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            &quot;[I]t is in my mind a very open question how<br/>&gt;             much the ear will accept different scale degrees<br/>&gt;             which are a small fraction of a semitone apart.<br/>&gt;             Your sequence would seem to suggest, &grave;quite<br/>&gt;             a lot!&apos;&quot;[5]</p><p>I assume that John agrees that<br/>these _diagonal_ retuning<br/>amounts are considerably more<br/>permissive than the amount of<br/>mistuning allowed when the<br/>same pitch appears twice<br/>consecutively or near-<br/>consecutively in a _melody_ . . .<br/>yes?</p></div><h3>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 11:43:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,<br/>a<br/>while<br/>ago,<br/>someone<br/>asked<br/>you<br/>to<br/>wrap<br/>your<br/>lines.<br/>I<br/>just<br/>wanted<br/>to<br/>say<br/>good<br/>job.<br/>I<br/>like<br/>your<br/>columnar<br/>style.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>G<br/>Z</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I assume that John agrees that<br/>&gt; these _diagonal_ retuning<br/>&gt; amounts are considerably more<br/>&gt; permissive than the amount of<br/>&gt; mistuning allowed when the<br/>&gt; same pitch appears twice<br/>&gt; consecutively or near-<br/>&gt; consecutively in a _melody_ . . .<br/>&gt; yes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

If a composer wrote a piece in which direct comma shifts are<br/>an intentional structural feature, then it is much more appropriate<br/>to keep those shifts in there as opposed to tempering them out.<br/>However, if a composer wrote a piece in which a common-practice<br/>diatonic language is at work, then I think the evidence is<br/>overwhelming that direct comma shifts are not appropriate in<br/>reflecting the composer&apos;s intent.
