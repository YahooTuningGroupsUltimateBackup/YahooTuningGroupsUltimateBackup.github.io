I know that you&apos;re catching up on some threads, and I&apos;m<br/>doing the same, because your comment here is too good to miss in<br/>what has been, especially on my part, not the shortest dialogue<br/>&lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Well, here&apos;s a piece in Peppermint where I used 7:9:11.<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;[50]<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; OK, is it the A-C#-F that&apos;s the 7:9:11, about 3/5 of the way<br/>&gt; into the piece? That was interesting when I first heard it; it<br/>&gt; was so acoustically strong that it destroyed my context of the<br/>&gt; tonality and sounded just like a raw sonic object (like a car<br/>&gt; horn or something), and I had to go back and listen over it<br/>&gt; again to be able to &quot;frame&quot; the scale in the proper context. I<br/>&gt; think if I were an expert Peppermint listener this wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have happened though; I&apos;d know how to frame it correctly the<br/>&gt; first time around. That&apos;s a really interesting effect; I&apos;d like<br/>&gt; to explore more music which manages to &quot;break through&quot; that<br/>&gt; interpretational layer occasionally.</p><p>You&apos;re right that this is almost exactly 3/5 of the way into the<br/>piece: around 0:36 out of 1:03 in all. And your comment is really<br/>fascinating, because to me this is a fairly standard idiom, and<br/>analogous to a transition in Monteverdi or Gesualdo, say, from a<br/>basically diatonic section of a madrigal to a rather melancholy<br/>chromatic section with various slower and more dramatic passages<br/>like suspensions. It&apos;s a rhetorical gesture to set the words _Ex<br/>dumeto illaquante bello_, &quot;Out of the entangling thicket of<br/>war...&quot; But clearly the impact for you want beyond that!</p><p>And this is really interesting: your report is very vivid and<br/>descriptive, and tells me that, for you, this passage was &quot;so<br/>acoustically strong&quot; as to be &quot;a raw sonic object.&quot; That&apos;s<br/>language that sticks with me, as the experience did with you,<br/>something requiring a different &quot;frame&quot; for the scale.</p><p>The intriguing thing is that in this passage, I&apos;m inspired<br/>(however wisely or otherwise) by 14th-century and 16th-century<br/>idioms, but am not really following either style: rather we get a<br/>contrapuntal hybrid of sorts. The 7:9:11, about which I learned<br/>in 2001-2002 from George Secor, is like a &quot;consonant fourth&quot; in<br/>16th-century writing, leading to a 6:8:9 suspension (here much<br/>more concordant than in Renaissance style!), with the fourth<br/>resolving downward to the minor third of 6:7:9, which resolves in<br/>a 14th-century manner to a stable fifth, with the outer voices<br/>ascending by tempered 28:27 steps. Here&apos;s a score in Sagittal:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Your reference to a &quot;car horn&quot; suggests that maybe the 9:7 third<br/>of 7:9:11 is part of this effect for you, since 9/7 is often<br/>called the &quot;car horn third.&quot; The curious thing is that 7:9:11 in<br/>this passage seemed more languid than strident to me, a bit like<br/>15:20:24 in the Renaissance. And either points toward a 6:8:9<br/>suspension, with the fourth descending by step to some kind of<br/>third -- here a 7:6 rather than a 5:4! -- in a penultimate<br/>sonority where we have a 3-1 resolution to complete the cadence.</p><p>Since we&apos;re listening to the same realization of this piece,<br/>factors like timbre are controlled -- so the difference in<br/>impressions signals a distinction in musical perceptions!<br/>But one possible distinction, especially if you have really good<br/>high frequency hearing, is that as an older listener, I may not<br/>be so aware of beating between higher partials. It&apos;s sometimes<br/>theorized that Mersenne may have become a bit more favorable<br/>toward 12-EDO as a harpsichord tuning in his later years because<br/>high-frequency hearing loss may have made the beating less<br/>obvious!</p><p>A final and very important lesson from your observation is that<br/>much the same difference of perception might have happened in a<br/>Parapyth tuning such as MET-24 or the POTE, as well as<br/>Peppermint: fine points of the generator size over a range of<br/>about 0.4 cents or whatever shouldn&apos;t distract us from more basic<br/>and dramatic things like the effect of the 7:9:11 on different<br/>listeners.</p><p>&gt;  I guess I just don&apos;t understand, for instance, why certain<br/>&gt;  rules are what they are. Why can&apos;t I have parallel fifths? Is<br/>&gt;  it because the fifth is the generator, or because it&apos;s 3/2, or<br/>&gt;  both? Is the correct generalization &quot;you can&apos;t have parallel<br/>&gt;  generators&quot; or &quot;you can&apos;t have parallel low-complexity<br/>&gt;  intervals&quot; or...? I still seem to think in 12-mode when I<br/>&gt;  write stuff in porcupine; it&apos;s a challenge to snap my brain<br/>&gt;  out of that sometimes...</p><p>A humorous note here, before I address your question where it&apos;s<br/>relevant, is that parallel fifths as well as fourths are quite<br/>routine in 13th-14th century and earlier medieval progressions<br/>and cadences! Some &quot;modern&quot; 14th-century treatises give a rule<br/>against parallel fifths or octaves in two-voice, note-against-note, writing -- but it doesn&apos;t apply even in theory with three or more<br/>voices until around the mid-15th century.</p><p>Since the 3/2 is the generator in medieval Pythagorean tuning,<br/>that obviously isn&apos;t a problem. Intuitively, I would say that a<br/>3/2 has a &quot;higher-complexity&quot; status where 2:3:4 is a saturated<br/>and complete harmony than where 4:5:6 is starting to fill that<br/>role, and that&apos;s likely one of the relevant variables.</p><p>And even in the 16th century, it&apos;s not the _sound_ of parallel<br/>fifths in textures for three or more voices that&apos;s the issue, but<br/>the relative loss of independence of parts where 3/2 is no longer<br/>the standard of rich stability, but less ideally euphonious than<br/>a third, sixth, or tenth. If the two voices cross which form the<br/>fifths, there&apos;s no violation of the rule. Some anachronistic<br/>criticism of 16th-century compositions treats this as a flaw; but<br/>it&apos;s a flaw in the eyes of the beholder, not of 16th-century<br/>practice or theory.</p><p>And in 20th-century counterpoint, as in the 13th century, it&apos;s no<br/>problem at all. The norm is that in serious writing we do want a<br/>variety of intervals and motions, which implies not overdoing<br/>parallelism of any kind -- but why not fifths, as long we keep<br/>some balance and moderation? In a medieval style, they&apos;re the<br/>most euphonious intervals of all, just as parallel thirds or<br/>sixths would be tolerated in Renaissance styles (although using<br/>them all the time between the same voices wouldn&apos;t be considered<br/>serious counterpoint).  And in a 20th-century style,<br/>quartal-quintal harmony likewise is often very much to taste.</p><p>And I should add that the acceptability of parallel fifths in a<br/>medieval or 20th-century style holds just as much in 12-EDO (not<br/>too far from Pythagorean) as in Porcupine or Parapyth or any of<br/>the other nifty systems we&apos;re discussing here. And parallel<br/>fifths between two voices (noncrossing) would be just as<br/>incorrect in a 16th-century style played in 12-EDO as in meantone<br/>or 5-limit JI.</p><p>Please forgive the length of my reply, but asking questions about<br/>rules of counterpoint, or simply describing our impressions of<br/>pieces or passages like that 7:9:11 that you heard in _O<br/>Europae_, can be really helpful in getting a musical context for<br/>some of the discussions on fine points of optimization, etc.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2012 9:51:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo, and sorry for taking so long to respond to this; I&apos;ll try to<br/>resurrect this conversation now...</p><p>On Thu, Nov 8, 2012 at 3:24 AM, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re right that this is almost exactly 3/5 of the way into the<br/>&gt; piece: around 0:36 out of 1:03 in all.

Also, I&apos;ll give links to a MIDI file and a PDF score (in<br/>Sagittal notation) of my piece we&apos;re discussing, _O Europae_:</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid</a>&gt;<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>We are discussing the point at about 0:36 (m. 25 in the score)<br/>where a ~7:9:11 sonority occurs that seemed to you at first<br/>&quot;so acoustically strong that it destroyed my context of the<br/>tonality and sounded just like a raw sonic object (like a car<br/>horn or something, and I had to go back and listen over it again<br/>to be able to &grave;frame&apos; the scale in the proper context.&quot; I&apos;m<br/>quoting from your earlier post, upon which you comment further<br/>here.</p><p>&gt;  It&apos;s that I wasn&apos;t able to cognize the sound I was hearing in<br/>&gt;  terms of notes in a scale. For instance, imagine you&apos;re<br/>&gt;  playing a song on your car radio and the person behind you<br/>&gt;  honks - it&apos;s likely you&apos;ll hear the honk as just a sound, not<br/>&gt;  something tonally related to what you&apos;re listening to.

The latter implies<br/>&gt;  some additional depth of musical cognition that&apos;s not present<br/>&gt;  in the former; the sound&apos;s been &quot;activated&quot; in a sense. So for<br/>&gt;  most of these past , I went on a quest to push my brain to<br/>&gt;  &quot;activate&quot; as many sounds in this way as possible, including<br/>&gt;  various scales that are typically heard as &quot;weird,&quot; like the<br/>&gt;  modes of melodic and harmonic minor and such.  It&apos;s the<br/>&gt;  difference between hearing lydian augmented #2 and thinking<br/>&gt;  &quot;that&apos;s weird&quot; and hearing it and imagining a chord like<br/>&gt;  C-G#-E-F#-B-D# moving to C-A-E-G#-B-E (notes in ascending<br/>&gt;  order) Now I&apos;m trying to similarly push my brain to &quot;activate&quot;<br/>&gt;  various microtonal scales but it&apos;s difficult because I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;  know what I&apos;m doing. :)</p><p>Thanks for calling my attention to some of these modes like<br/>lydian augmented #2! And I get your point about &quot;activated&quot;<br/>patterns: those one can parse and recognize &quot;on the fly&quot; as<br/>indeed meaningful patterns. How different people learn ways to<br/>parse something like lydian augmented #2 could be a discussion in<br/>itself, of course. Is this F-G#-A-B-C-D-E-F, for example?</p><p>As you also noted in the earlier post, previous familiarity with<br/>a tuning like Peppermint or MET-24 and the neomedieval idioms<br/>used in a piece like _O Europae_ can make the parsing easier: in<br/>effect, you gained this familiarity through experience.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; Since we&apos;re listening to the same realization of this piece,<br/>  &gt;&gt; factors like timbre are controlled -- so the difference in<br/>  &gt;&gt; impressions signals a distinction in musical perceptions!<br/>  &gt;&gt; But one possible distinction, especially if you have really<br/>  &gt;&gt; good high frequency hearing, is that as an older listener, I<br/>  &gt;&gt; may not be so aware of beating between higher partials. It&apos;s<br/>  &gt;&gt; sometimes theorized that Mersenne may have become a bit more<br/>  &gt;&gt; favorable toward 12-EDO as a harpsichord tuning in his later<br/>  &gt;&gt; years because high-frequency hearing loss may have made the<br/>  &gt;&gt; beating less obvious!</p><p>&gt;  It could be, though I suspect it&apos;s some deeper sort of<br/>&gt;  music-cognitive thing that has to do with assigning learned<br/>&gt;  interval &quot;functions&quot; to sounds. It sounded completely<br/>&gt;  different once I managed to place it in terms of the scale,<br/>&gt;  it&apos;s hard for me to describe.</p><p>Could this be a bit like optical illusions where we might see<br/>either two faces or a vase against a background, for example?</p><p>But I get the point that the issue here likely isn&apos;t &quot;dissonance&quot;<br/>or beats in the usual sense. Maybe it&apos;s more like what is<br/>sometimes termed &quot;melodic dissonance,&quot; but a bit different from<br/>that either. Not so much, &quot;Is this a smooth melody?&quot; as &quot;Is this<br/>a single texture, however smooth or jagged or whatever?&quot;</p><p>&gt;  The first time it sounded like a nice sound effect of some<br/>&gt;  sort. For instance, you can imagine some early 60s sunshine<br/>&gt;  pop song where they have a recording of the outdoors with<br/>&gt;  birds chirping and such. The first time I heard it, it was<br/>&gt;  like birds chirping - the individual notes didn&apos;t seem like<br/>&gt;  they were tonally related to the rest of what&apos;s going on.</p><p>A very helpful description, and I seem to recall effects like<br/>this a bit later on from the Beatles.</p><p>&gt;  The second time I managed to fit the sound into the scale I<br/>&gt;  was hearing and hear the dyads in it as having some sort of<br/>&gt;  diatonic/chromatic function, like I finally managed to cram<br/>&gt;  the slightly-misshapen jigsaw puzzle piece into place.</p><p>This is very important, and something I hadn&apos;t considered: not<br/>only can greater familiarity make a given progression sound more<br/>&quot;meaningful,&quot; but sometimes it can make what originally seemed to<br/>be a &quot;raw sonic object&quot; (quoting your earlier post) emerge as<br/>part of a connected progression or a single texture.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; A final and very important lesson from your observation is<br/>  &gt;&gt; that much the same difference of perception might have<br/>  &gt;&gt; happened in a Parapyth tuning such as MET-24 or the POTE, as<br/>  &gt;&gt; well as Peppermint: fine points of the generator size over a<br/>  &gt;&gt; range of about 0.4 cents or whatever shouldn&apos;t distract us<br/>  &gt;&gt; from more basic and dramatic things like the effect of the<br/>  &gt;&gt; 7:9:11 on different listeners.</p><p>&gt;  Another reason why I think there&apos;s more going on than just<br/>&gt;  7:9:11 is: here&apos;s a little ditty I wrote a while ago in 11-EDO<br/>&gt;  that features 7:9:11 as a sonority<br/>&gt;  &lt;<a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/tonal-study-in-orgone-temperament-11-edo">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/tonal-study-in-orgone-temperament-11-edo</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  This is using orgone[7] in 11-EDO, which is LLsLsLs. Maybe<br/>&gt;  I&apos;ll let you listen and make an impression first before I<br/>&gt;  describe what&apos;s going on...</p><p>Getting my impressions first, and then describing more about the<br/>piece and what&apos;s going on, is an approach I like. And I&apos;m very<br/>curious to get your more detailed perspective.</p><p>My first impression: a bit like a Bartok prelude from<br/>_Mikrokosmos_. Most relevantly here, I here no discontinuity or<br/>sense of sounds arising separate from the previous texture.

Your<br/>example of porcupine and counterpoint rules which might be<br/>analogous to those of the 16th century is a great exercise, and<br/>could prompt some compositions!</p><p>  &gt;&gt; Intuitively, I would say that a 3/2 has a<br/>  &gt;&gt; &quot;higher-complexity&quot; status where 2:3:4 is a saturated and<br/>  &gt;&gt; complete harmony than where 4:5:6 is starting to fill that<br/>  &gt;&gt; role, and that&apos;s likely one of the relevant variables.</p><p>&gt; Hmm, what do you mean by higher-complexity here?</p><p>Quickly, I&apos;m thinking of relative or &quot;contextual&quot; complexity in a<br/>given composition or style. A couple of examples might help.</p><p>A performance of a three-part piece by Perotin around 1200 that I<br/>first heard about 30 years ago starts out with a touch not in<br/>Perotin&apos;s score. First we hear the lowest voice alone, a unison;<br/>then the second voice at a 3/2, showing how rich a simple fifth<br/>can be; and finally the third voice at a 2/1, for a complete<br/>2:3:4 trine rich and resonant enough to encompass the universe.<br/>That&apos;s what I call a &quot;saturated&quot; sonority, as complex as we can<br/>get and still be restful and stable.</p><p>By the later 15th and 16th centuries, however, 4:5:6 or 10:12:15<br/>is taking over the role of a complete or saturated stable<br/>sonority, and Vicentino (1555) and Zarlino (1558) make it<br/>official. In this context, 2:3:4 is no longer so rich and<br/>satisfying from a perceptual point of view -- the &quot;richness of<br/>harmony,&quot; as Vicentino terms it, calls for something like 2:3:4:5<br/>or 2:4:5:6, etc.</p><p>So various people, including Joseph Yasser if I recall, have<br/>suggested that parallel fifths in a medieval setting are like<br/>parallel thirds or sixths in a 16th-century setting. As the<br/>favorite stable concords, they are acceptable as parallels -- but<br/>limited in serious counterpoint by the general preference for a<br/>variety of motions (especially contrary) and intervals.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; And even in the 16th century, it&apos;s not the _sound_ of parallel<br/>  &gt;&gt; fifths in textures for three or more voices that&apos;s the issue, but<br/>  &gt;&gt; the relative loss of independence of parts where 3/2 is no longer<br/>  &gt;&gt; the standard of rich stability, but less ideally euphonious than<br/>  &gt;&gt; a third, sixth, or tenth. If the two voices cross which form the<br/>  &gt;&gt; fifths, there&apos;s no violation of the rule. Some anachronistic<br/>  &gt;&gt; criticism of 16th-century compositions treats this as a flaw; but<br/>  &gt;&gt; it&apos;s a flaw in the eyes of the beholder, not of 16th-century<br/>  &gt;&gt; practice or theory.</p><p>&gt; Not sure I understand; do you mean that they&apos;re treating 3/2 as<br/>&gt; dissonant in general? As in, it&apos;s not as &quot;stable&quot;?</p><p>A good question that helps me communicate more clearly! There&apos;s<br/>no question that 3/2 or 2:3:4 is still stable in the 16th<br/>century, but it&apos;s increasingly felt as &quot;stable but incomplete.&quot;<br/>By the middle of the century, an ending like the following with<br/>1:2:3:4, which occurs in some later pieces also, might sound a<br/>bit &quot;conservative&quot;:</p><p>       ... A5    G#5  A5<br/>              E5      E5<br/>              B4      A4<br/>              E4      A3</p><p>The alternative is to have the second voice cadence on C#4, for<br/>example, giving us a closing sonority of 2:5:6:8.</p><p>       ... A5    G#5  A5<br/>              E5      E5<br/>              B4      C#4<br/>              E4      A3</p><p>So cadences of the first kind, common around 1500, were still<br/>used late in the century; but the second type, specifically with<br/>a major third or tenth in the final sonority, was standard by<br/>around the 1520&apos;s, and typified Vicentino&apos;s &quot;richness of harmony&quot;<br/>or Zarlino&apos;s &quot;perfect harmony&quot; -- the same role as 2:3:4 in a<br/>medieval setting.</p><p>&gt;  Well, sure, I agree with that. But I do note there&apos;s a certain<br/>&gt;  sound that happens if you avoid parallel fifths which is nice,<br/>&gt;  just like there&apos;s a certain sound you get if you use them<br/>&gt;  often...</p><p>True!</p><p>And Don Randel has suggested that the prohibition against<br/>parallel fifths, as it became more consistently observed by<br/>around 1450, played a large role in shaping 16th-century and<br/>later progressions by a process of exclusion. As someone most<br/>often following a medieval style, with countless cadences and the<br/>like routinely involving parallel fifths, I can appreciate his<br/>point.</p><p>&gt;  Well, consider porcupine. Porcupine is generated by a slightly<br/>&gt;  sharp 11/6, or by an interval which is about halfway between<br/>&gt;  11/6 and 9/5.  If I want to emulate 16th century counterpoint<br/>&gt;  in porcupine temperament, do I avoid parallel 3/2&apos;s, parallel<br/>&gt;  11/6&apos;s (aka generators), or both?</p><p>&gt;  I think it&apos;s both - the more you play the same dyad in a row,<br/>&gt;  the more it tends to fuse and sound like a single timbre (aka<br/>&gt;  what Ravel does with 1:3:5 chords in Bolero), and this happens<br/>&gt;  more if the dyad is simpler, like 3/2. That&apos;s my guess,<br/>&gt;  anyway.</p><p>Here I agree that both factors would be relevant: any kind of<br/>parallelism tends to reduce independence of voices, and more so<br/>with simple intervals like 3/2 (especially if intervals more<br/>complex than 3/2 or 4/3 are deemed fully stable and restful).</p><p>The interesting thing is that, if one assumes our 20/11 or<br/>whatever is stable and ideally euphonious, analogous to 5/4 in a<br/>16th-century style, then applying both factors might lead to<br/>tentative rules we could try out like these:</p><p>     (1) Avoid parallel 3/2&apos;s in &quot;serious&quot; 16th-century-like<br/>         writing;</p><p>     (2) Use parallel 20/11&apos;s or 51/28&apos;s or whatever in a<br/>         restrained way, especially in two-part writing, because<br/>         they&apos;re ideally rich and euphonious, but a row of more<br/>         than two or three creates something more like a textural<br/>         effect than the development of two independent voices.</p><p>     (3) With three or more voices, we might loosen up a bit on<br/>         rule (2), since two voices moving in parallel 20/11&apos;s or<br/>         whatever can be balanced by other voices in oblique or<br/>         better yet contrary motion.</p><p>As Richard Crocker humorously commented 50 years ago, rule (3) is<br/>not just an artistic liberty but a necessity, since while we may<br/>have three or more voices, there are only two directions that<br/>voices can move -- up or down! So what I might term &quot;ideally<br/>euphonious parallels&quot; are not only acceptable and pleasant, but<br/>almost unavoidable. The presence of passages in fauxbourdon even<br/>in the best 16th-century writing -- despite the distaste of both<br/>Vicentino and Zarlino, who find the parallelism unpleasant rather<br/>than sweet -- suggests that a bit of leeway might be interesting<br/>to experiment with in porcupine to see how things balance out.</p><p>&gt; Thanks Margo and sorry for taking so long to reply!</p><p>No problem, and taking some time led you to some really helpful<br/>questions which I saw shortly after getting back online.

How different people learn ways to<br/>&gt; parse something like lydian augmented #2 could be a discussion in<br/>&gt; itself, of course. Is this F-G#-A-B-C-D-E-F, for example?</p><p>Right, exactly.

I just wish I had some sort of idea about which specific<br/>phenomenon is involved when I throw these hand-wavy terms like parsing<br/>around. Since you seem to be familiar with the phenomenon I suggest,<br/>do you have any idea what exactly it means? Unlike when we talk about<br/>intonation, where there&apos;s lots of science to spare in terms of how<br/>things like the harmonic series works, I&apos;m completely lost here. I<br/>don&apos;t even know where to start reading if I wanted to.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It could be, though I suspect it&apos;s some deeper sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; music-cognitive thing that has to do with assigning learned<br/>&gt; &gt; interval &quot;functions&quot; to sounds. It sounded completely<br/>&gt; &gt; different once I managed to place it in terms of the scale,<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s hard for me to describe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could this be a bit like optical illusions where we might see<br/>&gt; either two faces or a vase against a background, for example?</p><p>I think it may be related to that, although a more apt analogy for the<br/>phenomenon you describe would be a 350 cent interval flip-flopping<br/>between a major and minor third to my ear.</p><p>However, as a side note, I have the feeling that every time I hear a<br/>tuning like 10-EDO, for instance, where I hear notes that are &quot;between<br/>12-EDO notes&quot; and my brain tries to continually make sound like<br/>altered versions of their nearest 12-EDO equivalents, the phenomenon<br/>you describe is taking place. That is, I&apos;m hearing broken pieces of<br/>the order in 12-EDO that are being reflected onto the tuning system,<br/>because it&apos;s just the best guess that my brain can come up with as to<br/>what&apos;s going on. It&apos;s like this picture:</p><p><a href="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060330234506/psychology/images/3/37/Emergence.jpg">http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060330234506/psychology/images/3/37/Emergence.jpg</a></p><p>If the tuning system is this picture, I&apos;m only seeing the &quot;spots.&quot; I<br/>have a very strong feeling that if I knew how to play the system<br/>&quot;correctly,&quot; or if some Mozart came along and wrote the perfect 10-EDO<br/>concerto, it would somehow communicate the correct &quot;perspective&quot; from<br/>which to view the tuning system and I would then instead see the big<br/>picture of the 10-EDO &quot;dalmatian.&quot; I&apos;m using fluffy and hand-wavy<br/>terms to describe my perceptual experience here because again, I don&apos;t<br/>have any idea what sort of correlate in the literature exists to<br/>describe what I&apos;m talking about. (Sorry if this is too much of a<br/>random tangent.)</p><p>&gt; But I get the point that the issue here likely isn&apos;t &quot;dissonance&quot;<br/>&gt; or beats in the usual sense. Maybe it&apos;s more like what is<br/>&gt; sometimes termed &quot;melodic dissonance,&quot; but a bit different from<br/>&gt; that either. Not so much, &quot;Is this a smooth melody?&quot; as &quot;Is this<br/>&gt; a single texture, however smooth or jagged or whatever?&quot;</p><p>It could be. I honestly think that it&apos;s something totally learned,<br/>like I managed to take the sound I was hearing and &quot;relate it&quot; to<br/>everything else I was hearing. The only problem is, I don&apos;t know what<br/>exactly the &quot;relation&quot; is that I&apos;ve come up with! I think it might be<br/>something like: I heard the chord the second time and was able to plug<br/>it into the circle of fifths, or something like that. I don&apos;t know if<br/>that&apos;s actually it, but it&apos;s something like it.</p><p>I&apos;m really fascinated by this aspect of music cognition because I feel<br/>like if I could identify and really nail down this sort of &quot;relation,&quot;<br/>and figure out what it is, then it would become self-evident how the<br/>rest of music works. It might help to answer the question: when people<br/>experience the mess of sound that is music - why they don&apos;t always<br/>just hear it as raw sound, like a train horn? What is the experience<br/>that&apos;s being added on top of that?</p><p>I think the answer is that they hear the notes all being related to<br/>one another in a certain way. Keenan Pepper has added to this the<br/>Krumhansl-esque realization that &quot;tonal&quot; music, specifically, allows<br/>us not only to perceive these relations, but to predict somewhat which<br/>notes are most likely to occur next. These are very simple cognitive<br/>things we&apos;re talking about, it&apos;s easy to confirm with a bit of<br/>introspection that these &quot;features&quot; of our musical paradigm are indeed<br/>present, and it&apos;s easy to see how a much richer musical structure<br/>could emerge from such simple building blocks. However, I still feel<br/>like there&apos;s something else to add to that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; was hearing and hear the dyads in it as having some sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; diatonic/chromatic function, like I finally managed to cram<br/>&gt; &gt; the slightly-misshapen jigsaw puzzle piece into place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is very important, and something I hadn&apos;t considered: not<br/>&gt; only can greater familiarity make a given progression sound more<br/>&gt; &quot;meaningful,&quot; but sometimes it can make what originally seemed to<br/>&gt; be a &quot;raw sonic object&quot; (quoting your earlier post) emerge as<br/>&gt; part of a connected progression or a single texture.</p><p>Yes, and from my perspective even more meaningfully, it can change the<br/>perception of a chord from &quot;a raw sound&quot; to &quot;a collection of notes<br/>which occupy a certain place in a scale, and a relation to other notes<br/>in the scale.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Here I take it that the 7:9:11 representation must be 0-436-764<br/>&gt; cents, close to a just 1/1-9/7-14/9 or 0-435-765 cents or<br/>&gt; 63:81:98, in contrast to a just 7:9:11 at 0-435-782 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now in a simple dyadic context, I might guess that 764 cents or a<br/>&gt; just 14/9 would be unlikely to represent 11/7 -- but with 7:9:11,<br/>&gt; the isoharmonic triad might have a greater attractive power so<br/>&gt; that 0-436-764 cents in orgone _can_ be perceived as 7:9:11!</p><p>I think so, though I&apos;m not sure what you mean by perceiving something<br/>as 7:9:11 - I hear the intonation is reasonably concordant, if that&apos;s<br/>what you mean. However, the key thing to my ear is that the 7:9:11 is<br/>part of the 2 2 1 2 pentachord in 11-EDO. When you play it, it sounds<br/>like you&apos;re playing C D E F G, however the whole thing is stretched so<br/>that C-E-G is 7:9:11. In that context, this version of 7:9:11 is<br/>completely different than yours; to my ears, mine sounds like a really<br/>stretched major chord (though I didn&apos;t always use it that way),<br/>whereas yours has a very complex functional relationship that took me<br/>a second to grab a hold of.</p><p>I may need to make some more examples of 7:9:11 in 11-EDO to make my<br/>point a little bit better on that, but to sum it up, I guess I&apos;m<br/>suggesting that a separation of function and intonation exists.</p><p>I think that many people start writing about how things like 7:9:11<br/>sound or how they work musically, but they don&apos;t realize that in their<br/>minds, the thing they&apos;re calling 7:9:11 has a lot of associated<br/>&quot;functional baggage&quot; with it - because they&apos;re still force-fitting it<br/>to the functional structure that they know, mentally. Then, when they<br/>describe &quot;here&apos;s how you use 7:9:11,&quot; they actually mean &quot;here&apos;s how<br/>you use [combination of functions they&apos;re remembering which happen to<br/>be intoned as 7:9:11].&quot; And one way to tease that apart is to show<br/>that a chord like 7:9:11 can take on completely different functions in<br/>different scales that cause you to force-fit it differently!<br/>Underneath it all is still that raw sound - the 7:9:11 train horn -<br/>but I think that it&apos;s the stuff we&apos;re projecting on top of it that<br/>gives it its real musical flavor. Well, that&apos;s my thought, anyway.</p><p>&gt; Another theme was that if some intervals were close to just in<br/>&gt; such a sonority, others might be a bit off without interference<br/>&gt; with recognizability. On this point, in orgone 0-435-764, the<br/>&gt; upper interval of 327 cents, just a tad smaller than 98:81,<br/>&gt; represents 11:9 or 347 cents in a 7:9:11 perception. That&apos;s a<br/>&gt; difference of 20 cents, but the isoharmonic triad may have a<br/>&gt; &quot;pull&quot; that overcomes this difference.</p><p>Yes, I agree with this, and furthermore I think that if you play a<br/>4:7:9:11 chord and take the 4 and 7 away, that 327 cent interval<br/>remaining might sound a lot different if you&apos;re still remembering<br/>those notes &quot;lingering&quot; than it would if you just played it cold.</p><p>&gt; Our parallel fifths discussion I&apos;m treating as a separate post,<br/>&gt; to keep the focus on _O Europae_, your orgone piece, and the<br/>&gt; question of when and how textures are perceived as unified or as<br/>&gt; an interrupted texture plus &quot;raw sonic object&quot; or the like.<br/>&gt; Also, this will give me a chance to pare down my remarks a bit on<br/>&gt; the parallel fifths question, while thanking you in advance for<br/>&gt; your excellent questions that helped me write more clearly!</p><p>Well, I hope I haven&apos;t added too much with the extra stuff above! But<br/>thanks for taking the time to respond to my post. The reason I&apos;m<br/>curious to ask you about this stuff is that you&apos;ve studied the time<br/>period when these sort of functional relationships shifted<br/>dramatically, e.g. major thirds stopped being &quot;avoid intervals&quot; and<br/>started being obvious consonances. I have no idea how someone could<br/>simply adjust their brain to make that happen, but I wonder if it&apos;s<br/>the same sort of &quot;activation&quot; process I discussed above with something<br/>like lydian augmented #2. Dunstable simply got the major chord<br/>&quot;activated&quot; for him or something.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2012 6:19:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Margo, for flagging this for my possible interest.</p><p>I have always been suspicious of the concept of &quot;perceived as &lt;some extended ratio&gt;&quot;, particularly when the numbers get to 11 and above, and my recent foray into combination tone chords, thanks to David Guillot, has given me more reason to be suspicious, mainly by giving me some alternatives that triads and larger vertical sonorities could be &quot;perceived as&quot;.</p><p>In the case of the alleged approximate 7:9:11 in 11-EDO we can ask how well it approximates being a &quot;C-B = B-A chord&quot; or equivalently a &quot;C=2B-A chord&quot; where A:B:C need not be whole numbers.

On this point, in orgone 0-435-764, the<br/>&gt; upper interval of 327 cents, just a tad smaller than 98:81,<br/>&gt; represents 11:9 or 347 cents in a 7:9:11 perception. That&apos;s a<br/>&gt; difference of 20 cents, but the isoharmonic triad may have a<br/>&gt; &quot;pull&quot; that overcomes this difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, I&apos;m interested not only in how you see -- and maybe<br/>&gt; Dave, if you&apos;re reading this -- the 7:9:11 question, but also the<br/>&gt; other details of what&apos;s going on.</p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2012 6:46:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Perhaps the 0-4-7 degree chord of 11-EDO could be said to be &quot;perceived as&quot; 7:9:9*noblemediant(5/4,6/5). i.e. as a just supermajor third with a metastable neutral third stacked on top, such that the 4-7 and 0-7 degree intervals are neither consonant nor disssonant, but assonant.</p><p>For nobles on the interval tree see <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/77502?source=1&var=0&l=1">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/77502?source=1&var=0&l=1</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2012 2:07:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Mike,</p><p>Thank you for a wonderful post that led me to do two experiments<br/>I describe below on our 7:9:11 perceptions and idioms in 22-EDO<br/>and 11-EDO. Your ideas were very much supported by these<br/>experiments.</p><p>While you express concern about going off on tangents, or going<br/>into &quot;extra stuff,&quot; really I&apos;m the one who should be concerned:<br/>would that I had your gift of concisely and very readably<br/>expressing my ideas in your relaxed and conversational way!</p><p>&gt;  Right, exactly. I note that it&apos;s specifically a sort of<br/>&gt;  harmonic parsing that I&apos;m talking about here, by the way. I<br/>&gt;  wonder if a similar 11- or 13-limit perspective exists behind<br/>&gt;  the various maqams, and if it&apos;s just waiting for someone to<br/>&gt;  activate the sound in the right way for me.</p><p>An interesting question: in a given situation, is this parsing<br/>mainly melodic (relating to melodic intervals) or vertical<br/>(&quot;harmonic&quot; in the sense of relating to simultaneous intervals or<br/>sonorities)? With our 7:9:11 idioms, the vertical is obviously a<br/>factor. With something like Lydian augmented #2, it could be<br/>either: as pure melody as in traditional maqam, or as a mode for<br/>polyphony of some kind.</p><p>&gt; Right. I just wish I had some sort of idea about which specific<br/>&gt; phenomenon is involved when I throw these hand-wavy terms like<br/>&gt; parsing around. Since you seem to be familiar with the<br/>&gt; phenomenon I suggest, do you have any idea what exactly it<br/>&gt; means? Unlike when we talk about intonation, where there&apos;s lots<br/>&gt; of science to spare in terms of how things like the harmonic<br/>&gt; series works, I&apos;m completely lost here. I don&apos;t even know where<br/>&gt; to start reading if I wanted to.</p><p>It&apos;s a term that I throw around with a very sketchy sense of<br/>exactly what I&apos;m talking about &lt;grin&gt;, but by analogy with<br/>grammar and theories of language, e.g. parsing a sentence. Maybe<br/>&quot;pattern recognition&quot; is the general idea.</p><p>&gt; I think it may be related to that, although a more apt analogy<br/>&gt; for the phenomenon you describe would be a 350 cent interval<br/>&gt; flip-flopping between a major and minor third to my ear.<br/>&gt; However, as a side note, I have the feeling that every time I<br/>&gt; hear a tuning like 10-EDO, for instance, where I hear notes<br/>&gt; that are &quot;between 12-EDO notes&quot; and my brain tries to<br/>&gt; continually make sound like altered versions of their nearest<br/>&gt; 12-EDO equivalents, the phenomenon you describe is taking<br/>&gt; place. That is, I&apos;m hearing broken pieces of the order in<br/>&gt; 12-EDO that are being reflected onto the tuning system, because<br/>&gt; it&apos;s just the best guess that my brain can come up with as to<br/>&gt; what&apos;s going on. It&apos;s like this picture:</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060330234506/psychology/images/3/37/Emergence.jpg">http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060330234506/psychology/images/3/37/Emergence.jpg</a>&gt;</p><p>An open question: when you speak of &quot;between 12-EDO notes,&quot; is it<br/>specifically 12-EDO that is your standard? Or is more generally<br/>certain diatonic patterns we might also find in 17-EDO, 31-EDO,<br/>or 22-EDO -- but not in 10-EDO? This is sort of an Easley<br/>Blackwood distinctions between &quot;regular diatonic tunings&quot; (or<br/>reasonably close irregular variations) and others.</p><p>To take an extreme case I learned about from Robert Walker:</p><p>  1/1 8/7 7/6 4/3 3/2 12/7 7/4 2/1</p><p>This parses easily for me as Dorian, a less usual tuning of a<br/>familiar and recognizable pattern. So a 49/48 step at 36 cents<br/>can be a very small semitone. And Paul Erlich found that he could<br/>play the Aeolian mode in 22-EDO with near-6:7:9 chords and have<br/>people enjoy it evidently much as with 12-EDO -- presumably<br/>including some regular diatonic semitones at 55 cents.</p><p>For me, the thing with 10-EDO (or a 20-EDO superset) is that lots<br/>of the interval sizes are familiar, but the nondiatonic structure<br/>(by European or maqam standards) isn&apos;t. For example, a &quot;septimal<br/>Rast,&quot; as I might call it, at 16:14:13:12, is 0-231-359-498<br/>cents -- as compared to 0-240-360-480 cents in 10-EDO. Yet the<br/>latter sounds a bit curious. A difference is that 14:13:12 or<br/>128-139 cents in JI gets compressed to 120-120 cents, and 7:6<br/>thus to 240 cents. Harmonically, 240 cents can make a wonderful<br/>&quot;xeno-third&quot; contracting to a unison, for example, but the<br/>melodic compression of 14:13:12 to this degree might be what<br/>seemed &quot;curious&quot; to me.</p><p>The ambiguity of an 11:9, say, is something that for me comes out<br/>especially in a harmonic context, when it is &quot;something else<br/>again.&quot; Basically that&apos;s okay, because in a neomedieval setting<br/>it&apos;s another kind of relatively complex third tending to some<br/>interesting resolution. But add 13:8 at a tempered fourth higher,<br/>and things get much more clear and defined. This feels a lot to<br/>me like starting with a bare 9:7 expanding to a fifth, with the<br/>third a bit blurry in a lower or middle register. Either moving<br/>to a higher register, or adding the fourth above so we have<br/>7:9:12 expanding to a full 2:3:4, clarifies things.</p><p>Melodically, however, something like 1/1-44/39-11/9-4/3 or<br/>39:44:48:52 sounds just fine: &quot;Ah, a good neutral step.&quot;  And I&apos;d<br/>look at any maqam-based polyphony with directed progressions<br/>involving thirds (major, minor, or neutral) as a kind of hybrid<br/>phenomenon. So I suspect my parsing here is primarily melodic,<br/>and might or might not be much like that of a Near Eastern<br/>performer.</p><p>&gt;  If the tuning system is this picture, I&apos;m only seeing the<br/>&gt;  &quot;spots.&quot; I have a very strong feeling that if I knew how to<br/>&gt;  play the system &quot;correctly,&quot; or if some Mozart came along and<br/>&gt;  wrote the perfect 10-EDO concerto, it would somehow<br/>&gt;  communicate the correct &quot;perspective&quot; from which to view the<br/>&gt;  tuning system and I would then instead see the big picture of<br/>&gt;  the 10-EDO &quot;dalmatian.&quot; I&apos;m using fluffy and hand-wavy terms<br/>&gt;  to describe my perceptual experience here because again, I<br/>&gt;  don&apos;t have any idea what sort of correlate in the literature<br/>&gt;  exists to describe what I&apos;m talking about. (Sorry if this is<br/>&gt;  too much of a random tangent.)</p><p>It&apos;s not a random tangent at all, something I may be at a lot<br/>more risk of indulging in. And the Mozart scenario is intriguing!<br/>Fluffy and hand-wavy is the way I tend to talk and think also, so<br/>we&apos;re on the same page there.</p><p>As I understand it, a lot of the RMP outlook -- and this isn&apos;t<br/>unique to RMP, but one of the themes it tends to emphasize, if<br/>I&apos;m right -- is finding some kind of mode or tuning that will be<br/>radically nondiatonic, and yet comparably compelling or readily<br/>parsed, so to speak.</p><p>What I&apos;m curious about: do you have a favorite or a number of<br/>favorite &quot;radically nondiatonic&quot; systems -- say miracle or<br/>porcupine -- where you have come to feel at home? This is what<br/>Brian McLaren said about EDO&apos;s (I recall that he composed in<br/>every one of them from 5-EDO to 53-EDO): Give yourself a bit of<br/>time to get acclimated, and you&apos;ll find each has a logical and<br/>increasingly familiar structure, whether you&apos;re listening or<br/>yourself composing.</p><p>With something like 13-EDO, &quot;the scale of 13 limmas,&quot; I found it<br/>wasn&apos;t too hard to feel at home: I started by designing a few<br/>timbres where 738 cents sounded like a tempered 3/2 (Bill<br/>Sethares would have done it much more expertly!). From there, it<br/>was mostly, &quot;The intervals don&apos;t add up in the usual way, but the<br/>more-or-less standard 13th-14th century progressions are neat!&quot;<br/>I&apos;ll spare you the stylistic mini-essay (another post), but I<br/>felt quite at home.</p><p>In contrast, 14-EDO was beautiful but more challenging, because<br/>individual cadences were great, and especially that 943-cent<br/>interval, but the structure seemed further from &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot;<br/>than 13-EDO. Maybe 14-EDO is my equivalent of a miracle subset:<br/>lovely intervals, and a radically nondiatonic structure.</p><p>&gt;  It could be. I honestly think that it&apos;s something totally<br/>&gt;  learned, like I managed to take the sound I was hearing and<br/>&gt;  &quot;relate it&quot; to everything else I was hearing. The only problem<br/>&gt;  is, I don&apos;t know what exactly the &quot;relation&quot; is that I&apos;ve come<br/>&gt;  up with! I think it might be something like: I heard the chord<br/>&gt;  the second time and was able to plug it into the circle of<br/>&gt;  fifths, or something like that. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s<br/>&gt;  actually it, but it&apos;s something like it.</p><p>Maybe this is a bit like learning a foreign language, where not<br/>only the new sounds and structures but the element of &quot;language<br/>interference&quot; or confusion caused by attempts to parse in<br/>familiar patterns make the process challenging for an adult.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m really fascinated by this aspect of music cognition<br/>&gt;  because I feel like if I could identify and really nail down<br/>&gt;  this sort of &quot;relation,&quot; and figure out what it is, then it<br/>&gt;  would become self-evident how the rest of music works. It<br/>&gt;  might help to answer the question: when people experience the<br/>&gt;  mess of sound that is music - why they don&apos;t always just hear<br/>&gt;  it as raw sound, like a train horn? What is the experience<br/>&gt;  that&apos;s being added on top of that?</p><p>Here it might be helpful to do studies of individual styles, and<br/>then try to generalize. I can articulate some 14th-century<br/>European relations, but other people know 18th-century European<br/>relations better, or maqam, or gamelan, and so forth.</p><p>&gt;  I think the answer is that they hear the notes all being<br/>&gt;  related to one another in a certain way. Keenan Pepper has<br/>&gt;  added to this the Krumhansl-esque realization that &quot;tonal&quot;<br/>&gt;  music, specifically, allows us not only to perceive these<br/>&gt;  relations, but to predict somewhat which notes are most likely<br/>&gt;  to occur next. These are very simple cognitive things we&apos;re<br/>&gt;  talking about, it&apos;s easy to confirm with a bit of<br/>&gt;  introspection that these &quot;features&quot; of our musical paradigm<br/>&gt;  are indeed present, and it&apos;s easy to see how a much richer<br/>&gt;  musical structure could emerge from such simple building<br/>&gt;  blocks. However, I still feel like there&apos;s something else to<br/>&gt;  add to that.</p><p>What I might get from Krumhansl (who I need to read) or Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s summary -- rightly or wrongly! -- is the idea that in a<br/>system of polyphonic progressions, it helps to draw the<br/>sonorities and progressions from the same material as the melodic<br/>steps. For example, a piece of maqam-based polyphony in Rast may<br/>sound more coherent if the sonorities use the regular steps of<br/>Maqam Rast, or inflections already present for melodic reasons.</p><p>The open question is with something like the D-mode in Machaut.<br/>Here the basic melodic material is an eight-note collection: the<br/>six stable diatonic steps plus the fluid B/Bb. But some of the<br/>most powerful expectations of &quot;which notes are most likely to<br/>occur next&quot; come, for example, from hearing E-G#-C# and expecting<br/>D-A-D, indeed the arch-typical 14th-century cadence.</p><p>It&apos;s like I&apos;m Machaut&apos;s dog, and for the last 45 years he&apos;s had<br/>me very well clicker-trained, a clicker being a device to<br/>_quickly_ reward a dog for desirable behavior by signalling<br/>something good that often (although not always) happens after it<br/>sounds, like a treat. So when that E-G#-C# clicker sounds, I<br/>anticipate the satisfying treat of a cadence to D-A-D. Or<br/>likewise A-C#-F# to G-D-G, etc. And the inflections are a big<br/>part of that &quot;click.&quot;</p><p>But not every click means an actual treat, at least not<br/>immediately. For example, we might have a section ending with an<br/>interrupted cadence: E-G#-C#, and then a pause. Maybe the next<br/>sonority is D-A-D; but maybe things stay up in the air for a bit<br/>before we have a clear cadence. And relishing these pregnant<br/>pauses and moments of uncertainty is part of the training also.</p><p>So maybe it&apos;s a question, for a given style, of going to the<br/>right puppy classes.</p><p>[On a 7:9:11 perception of 0-436-764 cents in 11-EDO porcupine]</p><p>&gt;  I think so, though I&apos;m not sure what you mean by perceiving<br/>&gt;  something as 7:9:11 - I hear the intonation is reasonably<br/>&gt;  concordant, if that&apos;s what you mean. However, the key thing to<br/>&gt;  my ear is that the 7:9:11 is part of the 2 2 1 2 pentachord in<br/>&gt;  11-EDO. When you play it, it sounds like you&apos;re playing C D E<br/>&gt;  F G, however the whole thing is stretched so that C-E-G is<br/>&gt;  7:9:11. In that context, this version of 7:9:11 is completely<br/>&gt;  different than yours; to my ears, mine sounds like a really<br/>&gt;  stretched major chord (though I didn&apos;t always use it that<br/>&gt;  way), whereas yours has a very complex functional relationship<br/>&gt;  that took me a second to grab a hold of.</p><p>Your post moved me to try two experiments.</p><p>The first was to try my 7:9:11 idiom in 22-EDO (usual harmonic<br/>timbre), where the tuning of 0-436-764 cents is identical to<br/>11-EDO, thus controlling that variable. I found that this shade<br/>was charming, a stimulating variant on the _O Europae_ version in<br/>Peppermint (0-437-784 cents), and maybe more accessible for<br/>people getting acquainted with this progression both because<br/>22-EDO is a more familiar system, and because comma niceties are<br/>tempered out. It&apos;s a bit like getting acquainted with<br/>16th-century keyboard counterpoint in meantone rather than<br/>5-limit JI.</p><p>The second was to move to timbres meant to maximize the<br/>consonance of 6/11 octave (655 cents) as a &quot;quasi-fifth,&quot; and<br/>explore the same 0-436-764 or 7:9:11 sonority. In the right<br/>timbre and in a higher range, your &quot;stretched major third and<br/>effect&quot; was very convincing! In the regular timbre during the<br/>earlier 22-EDO experiment, I _could_ hear it that way to a<br/>degree; but in this tweaked timbre and the right range, it was<br/>immediate, obvious, and natural. almost like meantone!</p><p>Part of the range thing may be something I hear in a temperament<br/>like MET-24 and a usual timbre also: 9/7 gets a lot mellower and<br/>&quot;aurally just (or near-just)&quot; as we go higher, also a reason why<br/>something like 7:12:18, e.g. in a medieval-style cadence to<br/>1:2:3, can be breathtaking. The higher frequencies may reduce the<br/>critical band kind of dissonance; one experiment, I recall, found<br/>that when people heard the two tones of a 9/7 with one tone<br/>presented in each earphone to avoid beats, it was hard to<br/>distinguish from 5/4.</p><p>So maybe 0-436-764 cents in 11-EDO under the right circumstances<br/>is a 14:18:21, with 9/7 shorn of its sensory dissonance, and 764<br/>cents heard in context as a stretched fifth. That&apos;s just a guess,<br/>but whatever it is, it&apos;s amazingly impressive!</p><p>In other 11-EDO contexts, again with these tweaked timbres, 764<br/>cents as a dyad did sound like a small minor sixth, which could<br/>contrast with and move to 655 cents as a weird kind of fifth.<br/>For example, in a pelog of 0-109-436-655-764-1200 or 1-3-2-1-4,<br/>the 655-cent step was clearly _kempyung_ (the &quot;third&quot; step,<br/>equivalent to a European fifth), and 764 a &quot;minor sixth&quot; often<br/>leading up by a &quot;large major third&quot; (436 cents) to the 2/1.</p><p>So the sensory consonance of 9/7 might be a dyadic effect (range,<br/>and also timbre), while the 7:9:11 &quot;stretched fifth&quot; effect could<br/>be triadic (i.e. 764 cents as part of a &quot;major third and fifth&quot;).</p><p>In MET-24, I can sometimes hear a similar effect in the upper<br/>register with C*-F-G# (0-438-772 cents) or the like -- which is<br/>fine for a version of the progression I&apos;m about to discuss from<br/>_O Europae_. The experience of vagueness I get now and then in a<br/>usual timbre, &quot;This is like an active major third and fifth,&quot;<br/>seems connected with some kind of beating or difference tone<br/>effect between the upper voices, maybe interacting with the 9/7.<br/>When I do the resolution we&apos;re about to consider, this resolves<br/>the intriguing ambiguity: &quot;Well, it turns out to have been a<br/>large major third plus a small minor sixth, with the third rising<br/>to the fourth and the sixth falling to the fifth of a 6:8:9<br/>suspension, etc.&quot;</p><p>Now an explanation of this neomedieval resolution and its 22-EDO<br/>version that was the focus of my other experiment, starting with<br/>links (especially for people who may be joining this thread) to<br/>the original version in _O Europae_ we&apos;ve been discussing in<br/>Peppermint with 7:9:11 at 0-437-784 cents. The relevant passage<br/>occurs at around 0:36, or measures 25-30 of the pdf score:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s my 22-EDO version, with spellings based on a regular chain<br/>of 709-cent fifths, intervals in cents, and some ratios the<br/>sonorities might represent.</p><p>        F      E               F<br/>        C#     D    C  B  C    Bb<br/>        A                      Bb</p><p>       764    709             764<br/>       436    491 273 218 273  55<br/>        0                      55</p><p>       11      9   9  12   9   3<br/>        9      8   7   9   7   2<br/>        7      6   6   8   6   2</p><p>When I tried this out, it was fine, a stimulating variation on my<br/>usual tuning in something like Peppermint or MET-24. In those<br/>temperaments, the opening minor sixth is very close to a just<br/>11/7 (782 cents), and actually a tad larger at 784 or 785 cents.<br/>Here it&apos;s 764 cents or a near-just 14/9 with a quality I find a<br/>bit more languid and quite charming.</p><p>From this colorful 7:9:11, the small minor sixth descends to the<br/>fifth while the 9/7 major third rises to the fourth, arriving at<br/>a 6:8:9 suspension, here 0-491-709 cents. This is actually rather<br/>concordant, but by historical association invites for me a<br/>&quot;neoclassical&quot; resolution of the middle voice downward from a 4/3<br/>to the 7/6 minor third of 6:7:9. Then, after a bit of<br/>ornamentation for a momentary 8:9:12 sonority (also rather<br/>consonant), the 6:7:9 resolves in a classical 14th-century<br/>fashion to a fifth, with the minor third contracting to a unison<br/>and the major third expanding to a fifth.</p><p>So for me, 22-EDO was another and quite successful shading of a<br/>familiar idiom. Two intervals are especially important here: the<br/>709-cent fifth and 55-cent diatonic semitone. The 709-cent fifth<br/>clearly represents 3/2 and provides a stable goal for the whole<br/>progression: directly for the cadential 6:7:9, and ultimately for<br/>the 7:9:11 and everything else leading up to it. And the 55-cent<br/>semitone is at once the defining difference and the vital melodic<br/>bridge between the opening minor sixth at 764 cents and the fifth<br/>to which it resolves at the beginning of the progression, as well<br/>as a vital ingredient in the closing cadence from 6:7:9 to 3:2.</p><p>More generally, the idea of a minor sixth resolving by oblique<br/>motion downward to a fifth is a basic classical idiom for me,<br/>whether as a cadential gesture complete in itself as in some<br/>13th-century pieces, or as part of a larger chain of cadential<br/>events.</p><p>So a central context here is &quot;small minor sixth descending to<br/>fifth via a small semitone&quot; -- in 22-EDO, 764 cents to 709 cents<br/>via a 55-cent semitone. I came to 22-EDO with a scenario, and the<br/>tuning system very nicely realized that scenario.</p><p>However, listening from a different angle, I also noticed how<br/>0-436-764 cents might well be heard as a kind of stretched<br/>sonority with major third and fifth. But the &quot;minor sixth<br/>inviting a resolution to stable fifth&quot; scenario was so familiar<br/>and attractive to me, based on my musical experience and<br/>conditioning, that it took priority. And, as I was to learn in<br/>the 11-EDO experiment described above, timbre and register are<br/>both vital! With a usual timbre, the &quot;stretched fifth&quot; effect was<br/>&quot;a possible alternative way of hearing.&quot; With a tweaked timbre<br/>and higher register, it was overwhelming!</p><p>&gt;  I may need to make some more examples of 7:9:11 in 11-EDO to<br/>&gt;  make my point a little bit better on that, but to sum it up, I<br/>&gt;  guess I&apos;m suggesting that a separation of function and<br/>&gt;  intonation exists.  I think that many people start writing<br/>&gt;  about how things like 7:9:11 sound or how they work musically,<br/>&gt;  but they don&apos;t realize that in their minds, the thing they&apos;re<br/>&gt;  calling 7:9:11 has a lot of associated &quot;functional baggage&quot;<br/>&gt;  with it - because they&apos;re still force-fitting it to the<br/>&gt;  functional structure that they know, mentally. Then, when they<br/>&gt;  describe &quot;here&apos;s how you use 7:9:11,&quot; they actually mean<br/>&gt;  &quot;here&apos;s how you use [combination of functions they&apos;re<br/>&gt;  remembering which happen to be intoned as 7:9:11].&quot; And one<br/>&gt;  way to tease that apart is to show that a chord like 7:9:11<br/>&gt;  can take on completely different functions in different scales<br/>&gt;  that cause you to force-fit it differently!</p><p>Agreed, as our two examples may demonstrate quite effectively!<br/>It&apos;s curious how &quot;activating&quot; the stretched-fifth thing took a<br/>bit of focused listening in 22-EDO with a usual timbre, but<br/>happened immediately in 11/22-EDO with the tweaked timbre and a<br/>high register.</p><p>With my 7:9:11 progression, the historical &quot;baggage&quot; could at<br/>least partly explain why you likewise needed a bit of listening<br/>to tune into the musical grammar based on 14th-16th century<br/>idioms in a curious mixture.</p><p>As to the &quot;force-fitting thing,&quot; I might sum up the wisdom of<br/>your last paraphrase by saying that &quot;Here&apos;s how you use 7:9:11&quot;<br/>often means &quot;Here&apos;s how I use 7:9:11 (in tunings with some room<br/>to accommodate my particular baggage).&quot;</p><p>For example, my neomedieval idiom gets accommodated just fine in<br/>22-EDO, with its 709-cent fifth to which the 764-cent &quot;minor<br/>sixth&quot; can resolve by way of a 55-cent semitone -- and likewise<br/>the 491-cent fourth to which the 436-cent fourth can rise at<br/>the opening of the progression to form a 6:8:9 suspension. But in<br/>11-EDO, these bets are off: the &quot;functional baggage&quot; won&apos;t fit!</p><p>With your stretched-fifth idiom, I&apos;d guess it could be there in<br/>any tuning system with intervals around 7:9:11, and the right<br/>timbre and register making the effect really unmistakeable.<br/>Its recognition might be especially likely in 11-EDO because<br/>there&apos;s no obvious &quot;perfect fifth&quot; to take priority.</p><p>&gt;  Underneath it all is still that raw sound - the 7:9:11 train<br/>&gt;  horn - but I think that it&apos;s the stuff we&apos;re projecting on top<br/>&gt;  of it that gives it its real musical flavor. Well, that&apos;s my<br/>&gt;  thought, anyway.</p><p>My experiments very much confirm your view!</p><p>   [On 327 cents in 11-EDO 0-436-764 cents representing 9:11]</p><p>&gt;  Yes, I agree with this, and furthermore I think that if you play a<br/>&gt;  4:7:9:11 chord and take the 4 and 7 away, that 327 cent interval<br/>&gt;  remaining might sound a lot different if you&apos;re still remembering<br/>&gt;  those notes &quot;lingering&quot; than it would if you just played it cold.</p><p>When I tried the 7:9:11 in 22-EDO, I did find that somehow that<br/>upper interval of 327 cents had a different quality than as a<br/>simple dyad. Alone, it seemed fine -- but somehow more &quot;neutral&quot;<br/>or something in the three-voice sonority. And that might get back<br/>to the attractive or cohesive power of isoharmonic sonorities,<br/>whether treated as unstable or stable.</p><p>One question of this kind is whether 0-415-761-1037 cents could<br/>approximate 11:14:17:20 (0-418-754-1035 cents). Here I&apos;m using 346<br/>cents, close to 11:9, as a 17:14 (336 cents) -- a bit analogous,<br/>although the difference is 10 cents rather than 20 cents! In<br/>other words: if 11:14:20 are all reasonably close, can 17 be off<br/>by 10 cents and still have a 11:14:17:20 synergy?</p><p>&gt;  Well, I hope I haven&apos;t added too much with the extra stuff<br/>&gt;  above! But thanks for taking the time to respond to my<br/>&gt;  post. The reason I&apos;m curious to ask you about this stuff is<br/>&gt;  that you&apos;ve studied the time period when these sort of<br/>&gt;  functional relationships shifted dramatically, e.g. major<br/>&gt;  thirds stopped being &quot;avoid intervals&quot; and started being<br/>&gt;  obvious consonances. I have no idea how someone could simply<br/>&gt;  adjust their brain to make that happen, but I wonder if it&apos;s<br/>&gt;  the same sort of &quot;activation&quot; process I discussed above with<br/>&gt;  something like lydian augmented #2. Dunstable simply got the<br/>&gt;  major chord &quot;activated&quot; for him or something.</p><p>Your &quot;extra stuff&quot; is invaluable and absolutely fine: it&apos;s mine<br/>I&apos;m worried about, wondering if I&apos;ve gone into too much detail<br/>that might not communicate well without musical examples (a good<br/>next step).</p><p>To cut to the chase on one fine point, I&apos;d say that major thirds<br/>in the 13th-14th centuries, or minor sevenths for that matter for<br/>a composer like Perotin or Machaut who evidently likes them a<br/>great deal, are analogous to seventh chords in Bach:<br/>&quot;avoid-in-closing intervals&quot; that signal pleasant and creative<br/>tension and motion rather than arrival and repose.</p><p>But with Dunstable for major thirds, or some of the 19th-century<br/>Romantic composers for sevenths, the sense of motion and tension<br/>is getting more and more &quot;floating&quot; and laid-back, so to speak.<br/>And intonations may change in the process: the stable 4:5:6 of<br/>the Renaissance, or Paul Erlich&apos;s stable 4:5:6:7 tetrad.</p><p>And new patterns do get &quot;activated.&quot; A quick example: the<br/>movement by Dunstable and Dufay and others toward restful thirds<br/>leads to a situation where a third can be a relatively and<br/>eventually quite stable resolution of a more tense interval, and<br/>specifically of a diminished fifth, e.g. B-F to C-E. Zarlino<br/>tells us that this is the one dissonance -- unlike seconds or<br/>sevenths -- that can be written &quot;in the same percussion&quot; without<br/>benefit of a suspension.</p><p>So while the increasingly &quot;laid-back&quot; nature of major thirds in<br/>the 15th-century is at first partly a matter of color, and indeed<br/>may be seen as a _blurring_ of 14th-century directedness where<br/>these thirds are vital in defining cadential tension (Richard<br/>Crocker&apos;s insight in the 1960&apos;s), it leads to a new kind of<br/>directedness in 16th-century polyphony, defining one type of<br/>frequent cadence. And in later 17th-19th century tonality, this<br/>theme of &quot;tritone tension&quot; becomes a central organizing<br/>principle.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2012 8:37:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Dave,</p><p>Thank you for your ideas about isodifference chords, difference<br/>tones, and Noble Mediants rather than complex integer ratios as<br/>possible points of orientation for these sonorities! I&apos;m sorry<br/>that I didn&apos;t see your posts before posting my last reply to<br/>Mike: this is really interesting! If I had seen it, needless to<br/>say, my discussion of &quot;7:9:11&quot; would have been a bit different,<br/>although not in a way affecting the question of a &quot;stretched<br/>fifth&quot; perception.</p><p>The idea that an isodifference or near-isodifference sonority, as<br/>often described, might actually be approximating a Noble Mediant<br/>(e.g. 327 cents in 11/22-EDO, under the right circumstances, as<br/>339 cents), is really intriguing.</p><p>For example, consider a sonority in one of my tunings at<br/>0-312.9-577.7-910.5 cents. One interpretation might be<br/>10:12:14:17, the diminished seventh of Helmholtz. But is it<br/>possible that this might be 5:6:7:~339c? My actual 332.8 cents<br/>isn&apos;t too far from this supraminor Noble Mediant.</p><p>For something like 7:9:11 as an isodifference sonority, I&apos;m very<br/>interested in your method for measuring the accuracy of the<br/>differences, and would like to check that I understand the method<br/>correctly.</p><p>In MET-24, the best 7:9:11 is 0-438.3-785.2 cents. Here 9/7 and<br/>11/7 happen to be wide by 3.2 and 2.7 cents respectively, with<br/>the neutral third at 346.9 cents or, accordingly 0.5 cents<br/>narrow. As I understand it, the idea is to calculate the<br/>difference between the two difference tones.</p><p>Let&apos;s assume the lowest voice is 420 Hz -- just a convenient<br/>figure evenly divisible by 7, to get an idea of the magnitude of<br/>the error in a range I often use.</p><p>We have 420 Hz and 540.9981 Hz for A:B, or a difference of<br/>120.9981 Hz. For B:C we have 540.9981 Hz and 661.0165 Hz, or a<br/>difference of 120.0183 Hz. So the difference of the differences<br/>is about 0.980 Hz.</p><p>     C: 661.017 Hz ----.<br/>                       |---- 120.018 Hz --.<br/>                       |                  |<br/>     B: 540.998 Hz ----.                  |---- 0.980 Hz<br/>                       |                  |<br/>                       |---- 120.998 Hz --.<br/>     A: 420.000 Hz ----|</p><p>If this is the correct method, I&apos;m wondering how to interpret an<br/>error of around 1 Hz. When you speak of &quot;percentage of the root,&quot;<br/>I take this as the lowest tone, rather than the implied<br/>fundamental of 7:9:11 (here 60 Hz). So here it would be on the<br/>order of 0.23% if the root is the lowest note, or 1.63% if its<br/>the fundamental.</p><p>How to interpret these errors, I&apos;m not sure, aside from knowing<br/>that the two difference tones may beat around 1 Hz in this<br/>frequency range for the lowest voice. Is this close or not so<br/>close?</p><p>By the way, for the kind of cadential idiom Mike and I were<br/>discussing, I have found that 0-437-784 cents (Peppermint) or<br/>0-438-785 cents (MET-24) is only one possibility: 0-436-764 in<br/>22-EDO, or 0-415-761 in MET-24, is fine also.</p><p>In his post, Mike made that the point that a description like<br/>&quot;7:9:11&quot; often carries lots of stylistic baggage about how one<br/>person or some people use that sonority, as if it were somehow<br/>inherent to the sonority itself.</p><p>A related point might be that a given cadential idiom may<br/>sometimes carry intonational baggage, like my thinking of a<br/>&quot;7:9:11&quot; idiom when I more broadly mean &quot;a cadence starting with<br/>a combination of large major third and small minor sixth, which<br/>might, as one choice, be tuned at around 7:9:11.&quot;</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2012 2:48:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo, and sorry for the delayed response; due to a death in the<br/>family I&apos;ve been busier than usual and family is coming in all this<br/>week.

I note that it&apos;s specifically a sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic parsing that I&apos;m talking about here, by the way.

With our 7:9:11 idioms, the vertical is obviously a<br/>&gt; factor. With something like Lydian augmented #2, it could be<br/>&gt; either: as pure melody as in traditional maqam, or as a mode for<br/>&gt; polyphony of some kind.</p><p>The best way for me to describe it is that it&apos;s &quot;scalar.&quot; I have very<br/>clear scale degrees in my head which get activated when I hear musical<br/>intervals. You might call these scale degrees &quot;functions&quot; instead, or<br/>&quot;categories&quot; or something. Perhaps this is &quot;melodic,&quot; I dunno - I<br/>don&apos;t know how to use it to write catchy melodies, that&apos;s for sure :)</p><p>But it&apos;s not intonational, and that&apos;s what I&apos;m sure of, unless there&apos;s<br/>some secret way in which it is that I&apos;m not aware of. Minor chords are<br/>&quot;minor&quot; to me whether or not they&apos;re 10:12:15 or 6:7:9 or etc; the<br/>minor &quot;feeling&quot; is preserved regardless, though there are some clear<br/>subtle differences in mood. And all of my musical emotions seem to be<br/>dependent on these interval functions first and foremost, and the<br/>intonations of them secondly.</p><p>Also, I&apos;ll go out a limb and say that this phenomenon accounts for<br/>about 90% of my musical experience, whereas ratios and intonation<br/>account for 10% of it. So it seems to me that if I want to experience<br/>new and fundamentally different musical emotions, which is what got me<br/>into this field to begin with, I need to learn how to perceive a<br/>radically new set of interval functions, however I choose to intone<br/>them. I&apos;ve spent the past few years learning all of this theory which<br/>is built around ratios and temperaments and intonation and such, but<br/>now it&apos;s clear that in order for me to get to the point I want to, I<br/>need to learn to hear music relative to a completely different<br/>foundation of functions and scales and dyads.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a term that I throw around with a very sketchy sense of<br/>&gt; exactly what I&apos;m talking about &lt;grin&gt;, but by analogy with<br/>&gt; grammar and theories of language, e.g. parsing a sentence. Maybe<br/>&gt; &quot;pattern recognition&quot; is the general idea.</p><p>I agree with this, but I wonder what&apos;s being recognized...</p><p>&gt; An open question: when you speak of &quot;between 12-EDO notes,&quot; is it<br/>&gt; specifically 12-EDO that is your standard? Or is more generally<br/>&gt; certain diatonic patterns we might also find in 17-EDO, 31-EDO,<br/>&gt; or 22-EDO -- but not in 10-EDO? This is sort of an Easley<br/>&gt; Blackwood distinctions between &quot;regular diatonic tunings&quot; (or<br/>&gt; reasonably close irregular variations) and others.</p><p>Half of it seems to be 12-EDO specifically, and half of it seems to be<br/>diatonic/chromatic/chain of fifths stuff specifically. When I first<br/>started out with different tunings, it was the former - 7/4 sounded<br/>&quot;crunchy but wrong&quot; to me at first, because I knew that to split it<br/>into two fourths, those fourths would also have to be flat, and then<br/>the LLs tetrachord would have to be compressed flat, but that would<br/>make the major thirds so flat that three wouldn&apos;t equal an octave...<br/>etc. I just intuitively knew that it would make everything break.</p><p>Sooner or later I got over that, by learning to allow the notes in my<br/>head to deform a bit to accomodate the new intervals, So I started<br/>learning to hear things like 7/4 as a type of minor seventh, and 11/8<br/>as a type of aug 4, etc.</p><p>These days, it still seems to be diatonic based though, or maybe I<br/>should say &quot;chromatic-based.&quot; If I play in something like 16-EDO, I<br/>generally just snap it into my head in terms of some 12 note chromatic<br/>scale. But, if I play in 19-EDO, something strange happens. I can now<br/>hear a very clear difference between sharps and flats. E-A# is lydian,<br/>and E-Bb is diminished. Also, the diesis is now the same size as the<br/>chromatic semitone, so I can play resolutions that exploit that and<br/>move from things like A#-Bb and hear the whole structure of the<br/>tonality swing waaaay across the circle of fifths to the other side.</p><p>I think it&apos;s pretty safe at this point to say that I have a set of<br/>19-EDO &quot;categories&quot; which are &quot;perfect&quot; in my head just like 12-EDO&apos;s<br/>are; they developed naturally as an outgrowth of the extended meantone<br/>structure. So maybe we can say that it used to be 12-EDO specifically,<br/>but now it&apos;s something more general, like diatonic-based or<br/>meantone-based or chain-of-fifths based or something. I really don&apos;t<br/>know.</p><p>&gt; To take an extreme case I learned about from Robert Walker:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 8/7 7/6 4/3 3/2 12/7 7/4 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This parses easily for me as Dorian, a less usual tuning of a<br/>&gt; familiar and recognizable pattern. So a 49/48 step at 36 cents<br/>&gt; can be a very small semitone. And Paul Erlich found that he could<br/>&gt; play the Aeolian mode in 22-EDO with near-6:7:9 chords and have<br/>&gt; people enjoy it evidently much as with 12-EDO -- presumably<br/>&gt; including some regular diatonic semitones at 55 cents.</p><p>Right, well, how about 1/1 12/11 8/7 21/16 3/2 12/7 7/4 2/1? Because<br/>that&apos;s clearly Dorian for me too, except that now 8/7 is a subsubminor<br/>third instead of a major second of some sort.</p><p>If you can also hear 1/1-8/7-3/2 as minor in the context of the above<br/>scale, instead of sus2, then all I can say is that I think that&apos;s a<br/>really, really significant thing, not just a trivial sort of<br/>curiosity. In my mind, that completely makes the concept of &quot;learning<br/>how different JI chords&quot; work meaningless. How does 1/1-8/7-3/2 work?<br/>Is it a sus2 chord, as in your scale, or a minor chord, as in my<br/>scale? When I &quot;detwelvulate&quot; my ears to hear things in some supposedly<br/>more natural way, what&apos;s the &quot;correct&quot; way to hear the chord? It&apos;s now<br/>obvious that the answer to every single one of these questions is<br/>&quot;mu,&quot; to quote a famous Zen koan.</p><p>&gt; For me, the thing with 10-EDO (or a 20-EDO superset) is that lots<br/>&gt; of the interval sizes are familiar, but the nondiatonic structure<br/>&gt; (by European or maqam standards) isn&apos;t. For example, a &quot;septimal<br/>&gt; Rast,&quot; as I might call it, at 16:14:13:12, is 0-231-359-498<br/>&gt; cents -- as compared to 0-240-360-480 cents in 10-EDO. Yet the<br/>&gt; latter sounds a bit curious. A difference is that 14:13:12 or<br/>&gt; 128-139 cents in JI gets compressed to 120-120 cents, and 7:6<br/>&gt; thus to 240 cents. Harmonically, 240 cents can make a wonderful<br/>&gt; &quot;xeno-third&quot; contracting to a unison, for example, but the<br/>&gt; melodic compression of 14:13:12 to this degree might be what<br/>&gt; seemed &quot;curious&quot; to me.</p><p>Well, if you already know how to hear 240 cents as a type of third, I<br/>guess the thing I wrote above will be old hat to you :)</p><p>&gt; The ambiguity of an 11:9, say, is something that for me comes out<br/>&gt; especially in a harmonic context, when it is &quot;something else<br/>&gt; again.&quot; Basically that&apos;s okay, because in a neomedieval setting<br/>&gt; it&apos;s another kind of relatively complex third tending to some<br/>&gt; interesting resolution. But add 13:8 at a tempered fourth higher,<br/>&gt; and things get much more clear and defined.</p><p>I totally agree with this too. 16:24:26:39 is magic. But, I still<br/>don&apos;t know if the ratios I just laid out have anything to do with this<br/>magicness.</p><p>&gt; This feels a lot to<br/>&gt; me like starting with a bare 9:7 expanding to a fifth, with the<br/>&gt; third a bit blurry in a lower or middle register. Either moving<br/>&gt; to a higher register, or adding the fourth above so we have<br/>&gt; 7:9:12 expanding to a full 2:3:4, clarifies things.</p><p>Is the root staying the same in both cases?</p><p>&gt; As I understand it, a lot of the RMP outlook -- and this isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; unique to RMP, but one of the themes it tends to emphasize, if<br/>&gt; I&apos;m right -- is finding some kind of mode or tuning that will be<br/>&gt; radically nondiatonic, and yet comparably compelling or readily<br/>&gt; parsed, so to speak.</p><p>The RMP outlook doesn&apos;t really address these questions. It just<br/>assumes that we want to find temperaments with chords that are close<br/>to small-integer ratios. It has nothing at all to say about the<br/>phenomenon with 8/7 that I presented above. It doesn&apos;t know what<br/>parsing is. It just tells you how to find tunings that have nice<br/>tempered approximations to simple JI ratios, and lots of them.</p><p>Quite frankly, I think that the existing RMP completely fails to<br/>explain this side of music, which to my ears comprises about 90% of<br/>what I hear, and that we&apos;re in need of some new basic realization to<br/>begin a new point of departure, just like Parncutt&apos;s work (among<br/>others) served as a point of departure for the existing RMP.</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;m curious about: do you have a favorite or a number of<br/>&gt; favorite &quot;radically nondiatonic&quot; systems -- say miracle or<br/>&gt; porcupine -- where you have come to feel at home?</p><p>A few. All of them are MOS&apos;s with more large than small steps, and<br/>where the ratio of large to small step is close to 2/1.</p><p>Machine in 16-EDO is fairly amazing; I can get into it pretty easily.<br/>That would be the scale 3 3 1 3 3 3.</p><p>Also, I&apos;ve found that I&apos;ll have these moments in mavila temperament in<br/>16-EDO sometimes, where I&apos;ll get a glimmer of this new sort of &quot;order&quot;<br/>lurking behind things, and it all makes sense - but then it goes away<br/>and I start imposing the 12-EDO order on it instead. It&apos;s very weak.<br/>Mavila[7] in 16-EDO is 2 3 2 2 3 2 2, and mavila[9] is 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2<br/>1. It&apos;s sometimes hard for me to tell the 2&apos;s apart from the 3&apos;s in<br/>mavila[7], and the 2&apos;s apart from the 1&apos;s in mavila[9]; this seems to<br/>interfere with making a very &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;stable&quot; set of scale degrees<br/>for me to be able to comprehend. Strangely, mavila[9] in 25-EDO is<br/>much clearer; it&apos;s now 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 2, though I don&apos;t know what the<br/>source of this stability is.</p><p>Sensi temperament doesn&apos;t have any great scales that I like, but the<br/>basic idea is that two 9/7&apos;s makes a 5/3 - huge chains of tempered<br/>9/7&apos;s like that sound amazing to me, like deep space or wind or<br/>something. I have no idea why it sounds that way, but it does; it&apos;s a<br/>completely new, &quot;xenharmonic&quot; sound to me. In contrast, Orwell has two<br/>7/6&apos;s tempered to make an 11/8, and then three 7/6&apos;s tempered to make<br/>a 8/5. Orwell just sounds weird and diminished to me; it&apos;s very dark<br/>and just sounds diminished and messed up. I doubt that there&apos;s some<br/>magic pattern in the ratios which makes it work that way.</p><p>Blackwood temperament in 15-EDO has some very very very crazy &quot;tonal&quot;<br/>effects going on because the circle of fifths is five notes wide. That<br/>really makes everything sound very &quot;related&quot; and this creates some<br/>sort of &quot;intense&quot; emotional effect. However, the scale 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1<br/>2 1, which is blackwood[10], just sounds weird and noisy to me; I can<br/>never tell the 2&apos;s from the 1&apos;s. In 20-EDO, it becomes 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1<br/>3 1, and now everything is much clearer, despite the chords not being<br/>major and minor anymore.</p><p>In terms of chromatic scales, 15-EDO seems to be the most &quot;stable&quot;<br/>nondiatonic chromatic scale out there that I&apos;ve found other than<br/>12-EDO. In 15-EDO, I need to start grouping 7/6 and 8/7 as different<br/>versions of the same &quot;thing,&quot; if you will, whereas 6/5 and 7/6 are now<br/>completely and obviously different. I &quot;sort of&quot; get the hang of this.</p><p>One of the craziest scales I&apos;ve ever heard is Bohlen-Pierce. I&apos;ve<br/>spent some time in BP and while I still don&apos;t have the hang of tritave<br/>equivalence, I&apos;m now fully aware that something about BP is really<br/>crazy. If I spend enough time in it, I&apos;ll start confusing 7/3 for 3/1.<br/>This is a mistake I would never make in real life, but after prolonged<br/>exposure to BP, my brain seems to start adjusting in very strange<br/>ways. I&apos;m not sure what it means.</p><p>All of those are sort of &quot;weak.&quot; Machine is probably the strongest of<br/>them. At any rate, that&apos;s all I can think of so far.</p><p>&gt; This is what<br/>&gt; Brian McLaren said about EDO&apos;s (I recall that he composed in<br/>&gt; every one of them from 5-EDO to 53-EDO): Give yourself a bit of<br/>&gt; time to get acclimated, and you&apos;ll find each has a logical and<br/>&gt; increasingly familiar structure, whether you&apos;re listening or<br/>&gt; yourself composing.</p><p>I play in either 19-EDO, 22-EDO, and 16-EDO almost every day, and I<br/>have for a year or two now. Maybe I&apos;ll regret saying this, but I<br/>expect that I would perform very well, comparatively speaking, on any<br/>sort of ear training test for all of these, demonstrating my<br/>familiarity with those tunings in a measurable way. Of course, it<br/>could well be the case that I perform comparatively poorly, at which<br/>point I&apos;d be happy to eat those words and humbly ask what sorcery<br/>you&apos;re all partaking in which allows you to hear completely novel<br/>22-EDO interval categories, where 7/6 and 6/5 are as different as 6/5<br/>and 5/4, which I have yet to discover.</p><p>The more time I spend in these tunings, the more I realize that<br/>there&apos;s a deeper theory that there is to stumble upon, which we don&apos;t<br/>currently know. I think that if we administered an ear training test<br/>to a lot of people, the people who do best on the ear training test<br/>will be the people who also have had the same realization. I have come<br/>to conclude that in situations where 6:7:9 and 10:12:15 sound the<br/>same, they&apos;re &apos;supposed&apos; to sound the same. Then, once that&apos;s<br/>accepted, one can then start looking for times when they&apos;re &apos;supposed&apos;<br/>to sound different. For instance, hedgehog temperament in 22-EDO is a<br/>scale which suddenly makes it very easy to distinguish between 7/6 and<br/>6/5, and it&apos;s given by 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3. I have no idea how or why this<br/>works; I feel like I&apos;ve made some progress towards understanding this,<br/>but that I only know half of the picture.</p><p>&gt; With something like 13-EDO, &quot;the scale of 13 limmas,&quot; I found it<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t too hard to feel at home: I started by designing a few<br/>&gt; timbres where 738 cents sounded like a tempered 3/2 (Bill<br/>&gt; Sethares would have done it much more expertly!). From there, it<br/>&gt; was mostly, &quot;The intervals don&apos;t add up in the usual way, but the<br/>&gt; more-or-less standard 13th-14th century progressions are neat!&quot;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll spare you the stylistic mini-essay (another post), but I<br/>&gt; felt quite at home.</p><p>I would be very interested to hear what you came up with in this tuning!</p><p>&gt; In contrast, 14-EDO was beautiful but more challenging, because<br/>&gt; individual cadences were great, and especially that 943-cent<br/>&gt; interval, but the structure seemed further from &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot;<br/>&gt; than 13-EDO. Maybe 14-EDO is my equivalent of a miracle subset:<br/>&gt; lovely intervals, and a radically nondiatonic structure.</p><p>Yes, I absolutely agree with this. I didn&apos;t mention 14-EDO above<br/>because I&apos;m still new to it, but I think there&apos;s magic to it. In<br/>14-EDO, 5/4 and 6/5 become two different intonations of the same<br/>thing, and 7/6 and 8/7 become two different intonations of the same<br/>thing. Also, 14-EDO magically contains all of the touch tone intervals<br/>on your phone. There is definitely something interesting about 14-EDO.<br/>However, I have trouble hearing 5/4 and 6/5 as just two different<br/>versions of the 14-EDO neutral third.</p><p>&gt; Maybe this is a bit like learning a foreign language, where not<br/>&gt; only the new sounds and structures but the element of &quot;language<br/>&gt; interference&quot; or confusion caused by attempts to parse in<br/>&gt; familiar patterns make the process challenging for an adult.</p><p>Yes, I think so; specifically I think this happens when I try to play<br/>in really radically nondiatonic tuning systems. I just keep hearing<br/>12-EDO patterns and I&apos;m not sure what sorts of things to play which<br/>convey to my brain a really strong, and most importantly &quot;stable&quot;,<br/>sort of novel pattern in the new tuning system, so that my brain is<br/>likely to gravitate to this new pattern and not the old broken 12-EDO<br/>patterns it ends up hearing instead, corresponding to my brain trying<br/>its best and giving up.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m really fascinated by this aspect of music cognition<br/>&gt; &gt; because I feel like if I could identify and really nail down<br/>&gt; &gt; this sort of &quot;relation,&quot; and figure out what it is, then it<br/>&gt; &gt; would become self-evident how the rest of music works. It<br/>&gt; &gt; might help to answer the question: when people experience the<br/>&gt; &gt; mess of sound that is music - why they don&apos;t always just hear<br/>&gt; &gt; it as raw sound, like a train horn? What is the experience<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s being added on top of that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it might be helpful to do studies of individual styles, and<br/>&gt; then try to generalize. I can articulate some 14th-century<br/>&gt; European relations, but other people know 18th-century European<br/>&gt; relations better, or maqam, or gamelan, and so forth.</p><p>What sorts of relations do people hear?</p><p>&gt; What I might get from Krumhansl (who I need to read) or Paul<br/>&gt; Erlich&apos;s summary -- rightly or wrongly! -- is the idea that in a<br/>&gt; system of polyphonic progressions, it helps to draw the<br/>&gt; sonorities and progressions from the same material as the melodic<br/>&gt; steps. For example, a piece of maqam-based polyphony in Rast may<br/>&gt; sound more coherent if the sonorities use the regular steps of<br/>&gt; Maqam Rast, or inflections already present for melodic reasons.</p><p>Hm, I&apos;m not sure I understand this - what do you mean to draw the<br/>sonorities from the same material as the melodic steps, exactly?</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s like I&apos;m Machaut&apos;s dog, and for the last 45 years he&apos;s had<br/>&gt; me very well clicker-trained, a clicker being a device to<br/>&gt; _quickly_ reward a dog for desirable behavior by signalling<br/>&gt; something good that often (although not always) happens after it<br/>&gt; sounds, like a treat. So when that E-G#-C# clicker sounds, I<br/>&gt; anticipate the satisfying treat of a cadence to D-A-D. Or<br/>&gt; likewise A-C#-F# to G-D-G, etc. And the inflections are a big<br/>&gt; part of that &quot;click.&quot;</p><p>Yes, this is exactly how I hear it too! But I wonder, is classical<br/>conditioning all that there is to resolutions, or is there some<br/>scale-theoretic reason which makes the tritone resolution more<br/>&quot;forceful&quot; than the double leading tone cadence? In other words, if we<br/>imagine that the listener is constantly maintaining a copy of the<br/>scale in his/her head at all times, is there some scale-theoretic<br/>reason why the tritone resolution might &quot;refresh&quot; more of this scale<br/>than the double leading tone resolution, or is it just classical<br/>conditioning?</p><p>&gt; The second was to move to timbres meant to maximize the<br/>&gt; consonance of 6/11 octave (655 cents) as a &quot;quasi-fifth,&quot; and<br/>&gt; explore the same 0-436-764 or 7:9:11 sonority. In the right<br/>&gt; timbre and in a higher range, your &quot;stretched major third and<br/>&gt; effect&quot; was very convincing! In the regular timbre during the<br/>&gt; earlier 22-EDO experiment, I _could_ hear it that way to a<br/>&gt; degree; but in this tweaked timbre and the right range, it was<br/>&gt; immediate, obvious, and natural. almost like meantone!</p><p>So if I understand correctly, you flattened the third harmonic of the<br/>timbre to 655 cents, and then 764 cents sounded like a fifth...? I<br/>would have expected that if anything, sharpening the third harmonic to<br/>764 cents would have made this happen more...</p><p>While you&apos;re in 22-EDO, you may want to play in hedgehog, which is 3 3<br/>2 3 3 3 2 3. If you&apos;re like me, that 3 3 2 is very clearly some sort<br/>of do re mi fa, except the &quot;mi&quot; is 6/5, and the &quot;fa&quot; is 9/7, which is<br/>apparently a shade of perfect fourth today...</p><p>&gt; Part of the range thing may be something I hear in a temperament<br/>&gt; like MET-24 and a usual timbre also: 9/7 gets a lot mellower and<br/>&gt; &quot;aurally just (or near-just)&quot; as we go higher, also a reason why<br/>&gt; something like 7:12:18, e.g. in a medieval-style cadence to<br/>&gt; 1:2:3, can be breathtaking. The higher frequencies may reduce the<br/>&gt; critical band kind of dissonance; one experiment, I recall, found<br/>&gt; that when people heard the two tones of a 9/7 with one tone<br/>&gt; presented in each earphone to avoid beats, it was hard to<br/>&gt; distinguish from 5/4.</p><p>This is probably part of it; it&apos;s also been shown that the tendency<br/>towards virtual pitch integration increases as the VF gets higher in<br/>pitch. So as the 9/7 gets higher, there may be more of a tendency to<br/>hear it as (1):7:9, where the (1) is a virtual fundamental which you<br/>can hear if you focus on it. For me, I need only to imagine the 9/7 as<br/>part of a rootless (4):7:9 to totally transform the sound of it to<br/>something much more musically consonant.</p><p>&gt; So maybe 0-436-764 cents in 11-EDO under the right circumstances<br/>&gt; is a 14:18:21, with 9/7 shorn of its sensory dissonance, and 764<br/>&gt; cents heard in context as a stretched fifth. That&apos;s just a guess,<br/>&gt; but whatever it is, it&apos;s amazingly impressive!</p><p>Perhaps... I would suspect, however, that this sort of analysis makes<br/>ratios into a procrustean bed we&apos;re fitting something to, whereas the<br/>fundamental thing we&apos;re hearing is something much deeper and related<br/>to the properties of scales. I think that 14:18:21 sounds like<br/>root-major third-fifth, not the other way around, with the latter<br/>being the thing which is truly &quot;fundamental&quot; - at least to a 12-EDO<br/>listener. That being said, I can&apos;t claim that I really know what&apos;s<br/>going on.</p><p>&gt; In other 11-EDO contexts, again with these tweaked timbres, 764<br/>&gt; cents as a dyad did sound like a small minor sixth, which could<br/>&gt; contrast with and move to 655 cents as a weird kind of fifth.</p><p>In the context of the scale 2 2 1 2 2 2, if I go up to the octave and<br/>then go two whole steps down, it sounds like a small minor sixth,<br/>whereas if I go up from the tonic via 2 2 1 2, it sounds like a large<br/>perfect fifth - to my ears, anyway.</p><p>&gt; In MET-24, I can sometimes hear a similar effect in the upper<br/>&gt; register with C*-F-G# (0-438-772 cents) or the like -- which is<br/>&gt; fine for a version of the progression I&apos;m about to discuss from<br/>&gt; _O Europae_. The experience of vagueness I get now and then in a<br/>&gt; usual timbre, &quot;This is like an active major third and fifth,&quot;<br/>&gt; seems connected with some kind of beating or difference tone<br/>&gt; effect between the upper voices, maybe interacting with the 9/7.<br/>&gt; When I do the resolution we&apos;re about to consider, this resolves<br/>&gt; the intriguing ambiguity: &quot;Well, it turns out to have been a<br/>&gt; large major third plus a small minor sixth, with the third rising<br/>&gt; to the fourth and the sixth falling to the fifth of a 6:8:9<br/>&gt; suspension, etc.&quot;</p><p>So you&apos;re saying that at first, it seems like some sort of stretched<br/>major chord, right? But then, once you resolve it in the manner you<br/>describe, your perception of the chord changes -retroactively-, right?<br/>I hadn&apos;t thought about this before, but I totally agree that this<br/>happens, though not for me this time - it required repeated listens<br/>for me to &quot;decipher&quot; what was happening.</p><p>Ironically, after this discussion and a year or so&apos;s worth of parallel<br/>offlist discussions with Keenan Pepper, I&apos;m now starting to feel like<br/>we have -too many- different leads! But the question that I have which<br/>lurks underneath all of this is: how are all of these different<br/>concepts - classical conditioning of resolutions, scale-based and<br/>non-ratio-based &quot;function&quot; assignment of intervals, retroactive<br/>reidentification of functions, ease of distinguishing intervals in a<br/>scale if they&apos;re all as far apart from one another as possible<br/>(haven&apos;t mentioned this yet but it&apos;s true), formation of a &quot;map&quot; of<br/>said functions (haven&apos;t talked about this yet either but it&apos;s also<br/>true) in a novel tuning system - what is the underlying theme that<br/>unifies all of these things? What are we even talking about? I&apos;ve got<br/>a &quot;eureka&quot; ready to go if anyone can figure out what part of reality<br/>we&apos;re even discussing here...</p><p>&gt; From this colorful 7:9:11, the small minor sixth descends to the<br/>&gt; fifth while the 9/7 major third rises to the fourth, arriving at<br/>&gt; a 6:8:9 suspension, here 0-491-709 cents.</p><p>This is how I heard it after four or five listens. What happened with<br/>me when I listened to the segment that you describe is - at first, I<br/>clicked right to the chord, and heard it as a completely foreign and<br/>atonal sort of thing; couldn&apos;t figure it out at all. Then I heard it<br/>resolve to the A-D-E and A-C-E, and knew I was at the right place.<br/>Then I tried listening again, a few bars earlier, and still it sounded<br/>very strange when that chord came up. Then after a few more listens, I<br/>started hearing the chord as a sort of augmented chord, which then<br/>resolved to A-D-E and then to A-C-E. Now that I know what it is, I can<br/>immediately snap it into that sort of augmented framework. (You may be<br/>labeling the note names differently; I&apos;m just describing what I hear.)</p><p>&gt; However, listening from a different angle, I also noticed how<br/>&gt; 0-436-764 cents might well be heard as a kind of stretched<br/>&gt; sonority with major third and fifth. But the &quot;minor sixth<br/>&gt; inviting a resolution to stable fifth&quot; scenario was so familiar<br/>&gt; and attractive to me, based on my musical experience and<br/>&gt; conditioning, that it took priority.</p><p>I am personally very familiar with this phenomenon. I think that my<br/>problem is that when I play in radically nondiatonic scales, there are<br/>a lot of 12-EDO things which constantly &quot;take priority&quot; in my head. I<br/>suspect that there&apos;s some way to play things in a tuning system like<br/>10-EDO, for instance, which would be so &quot;strong&quot; due to unknown<br/>factors that almost any listener hearing would have to interpret those<br/>in this novel &quot;strong&quot; way instead of some old 12-EDO &quot;best I could<br/>do&quot; sort of way. If only I knew how...</p><p>&gt; And, as I was to learn in<br/>&gt; the 11-EDO experiment described above, timbre and register are<br/>&gt; both vital! With a usual timbre, the &quot;stretched fifth&quot; effect was<br/>&gt; &quot;a possible alternative way of hearing.&quot; With a tweaked timbre<br/>&gt; and higher register, it was overwhelming!</p><p>Well, I note that I hear the stretched fifth even with normal timbres<br/>- in the scale 2 2 1 2 2 2, it&apos;s fairly hard to avoid for me. What<br/>happens if you use a very relaxed timbre, like an ocarina sound?</p><p>I know that for me, even with normal timbres, if I load up 2 2 1 2 2<br/>2, play a root-third-fifth triad and transpose it up and down the<br/>scale, I hear something like C-E-G -&gt; D-F-A -&gt; E-G-C -&gt; F-A-D -&gt; etc,<br/>sort of a gospel-ish hexatonic thing. I&apos;m aware that it&apos;s not really<br/>the 12-EDO version of that, but that&apos;s the resemblance that I sort of<br/>hear.</p><p>Did you hear the tonic chord in &quot;tonal study in orgone&quot; as being some<br/>sort of root-major third-fifth? That was also 7:9:11.</p><p>&gt; With my 7:9:11 progression, the historical &quot;baggage&quot; could at<br/>&gt; least partly explain why you likewise needed a bit of listening<br/>&gt; to tune into the musical grammar based on 14th-16th century<br/>&gt; idioms in a curious mixture.</p><p>Agreed. I think that about answers that question as best as it can be<br/>answered; it&apos;s definitely true that your past experiences biased you<br/>towards parsing the chord in a certain way, whereas it took me a<br/>second to catch on. That being said, I wish I knew how to model this<br/>&quot;parsing&quot; process, or even knew what it was parsing, or what I&apos;m<br/>recognizing things as - what the building blocks of something like<br/>&quot;musical grammar&quot; are.</p><p>&gt; As to the &quot;force-fitting thing,&quot; I might sum up the wisdom of<br/>&gt; your last paraphrase by saying that &quot;Here&apos;s how you use 7:9:11&quot;<br/>&gt; often means &quot;Here&apos;s how I use 7:9:11 (in tunings with some room<br/>&gt; to accommodate my particular baggage).&quot;</p><p>Yes, I absolutely agree with this. I strongly suspect that<br/>microtonalists are secretly manipulating 12-EDO/western/common<br/>practice/etc functions and categories in their heads when they play in<br/>extended JI, but then ascribe those powers to something like a set of<br/>ratios. This is just a hunch, though; there may be some among us who<br/>truly do hear a completely novel set of interval functions which are<br/>radically unlike anything we&apos;re used to in 12-EDO, and where 7/6 is<br/>its own novel interval class, not just a sort of minor third. However,<br/>if these sorts of &quot;enlightened&quot; listeners are among us, they seem to<br/>be the silent lurker type...</p><p>&gt; For example, my neomedieval idiom gets accommodated just fine in<br/>&gt; 22-EDO, with its 709-cent fifth to which the 764-cent &quot;minor<br/>&gt; sixth&quot; can resolve by way of a 55-cent semitone -- and likewise<br/>&gt; the 491-cent fourth to which the 436-cent fourth can rise at<br/>&gt; the opening of the progression to form a 6:8:9 suspension. But in<br/>&gt; 11-EDO, these bets are off: the &quot;functional baggage&quot; won&apos;t fit!</p><p>Right. Not only won&apos;t it fit, but you can come up with new things that<br/>do fit which effectively supercede the old things, which is what I<br/>tried to do in my tonal study for orgone. Now, to figure out how to<br/>supercede 12-EDO when I play in 15-EDO...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, I agree with this, and furthermore I think that if you play a<br/>&gt; &gt; 4:7:9:11 chord and take the 4 and 7 away, that 327 cent interval<br/>&gt; &gt; remaining might sound a lot different if you&apos;re still remembering<br/>&gt; &gt; those notes &quot;lingering&quot; than it would if you just played it cold.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I tried the 7:9:11 in 22-EDO, I did find that somehow that<br/>&gt; upper interval of 327 cents had a different quality than as a<br/>&gt; simple dyad. Alone, it seemed fine -- but somehow more &quot;neutral&quot;<br/>&gt; or something in the three-voice sonority. And that might get back<br/>&gt; to the attractive or cohesive power of isoharmonic sonorities,<br/>&gt; whether treated as unstable or stable.</p><p>This is 100% in line with my experience, though I experience the same<br/>thing with pretty much any sort of chord containing that dyad as<br/>though it were 11/9. For instance, 8:9:10:11:12 is an example of such<br/>a chord, as is 8:9:11:12 or 8:9:10:11. This comes up a lot in<br/>porcupine. If I play 8:9:10:11:12 and then take everything but the<br/>11/9 away, it definitely starts sounding &quot;neutral&quot; all of a sudden.<br/>I&apos;m completely certain that I have no idea how that works, though I do<br/>know it also works with non-isoharmonic chords, so long as I perceive<br/>the &quot;root&quot; of the 327 cent interval as being a 9/8 below the lowest<br/>note...</p><p>&gt; One question of this kind is whether 0-415-761-1037 cents could<br/>&gt; approximate 11:14:17:20 (0-418-754-1035 cents). Here I&apos;m using 346<br/>&gt; cents, close to 11:9, as a 17:14 (336 cents) -- a bit analogous,<br/>&gt; although the difference is 10 cents rather than 20 cents! In<br/>&gt; other words: if 11:14:20 are all reasonably close, can 17 be off<br/>&gt; by 10 cents and still have a 11:14:17:20 synergy?</p><p>In terms of the actual effect caused by isoharmonic chords, which is<br/>what we were calling &quot;periodicity buzz,&quot; it&apos;d have some sort of<br/>effect, but the 17 cents being off would definitely make the whole<br/>thing not seem to buzz in sync with itself. Though, after everything<br/>above, it now seems to me to be rather unlikely that the fundamental<br/>qualia of our musical experience are ratios, or that we really<br/>fundamentally hear things &quot;as&quot; ratios at all...</p><p>&gt; Your &quot;extra stuff&quot; is invaluable and absolutely fine: it&apos;s mine<br/>&gt; I&apos;m worried about, wondering if I&apos;ve gone into too much detail<br/>&gt; that might not communicate well without musical examples (a good<br/>&gt; next step).</p><p>I feel the same way. For me, my head has been a chaotic swirl of these<br/>ideas for the past year; I&apos;m desperately trying to find a way to<br/>organize it all, but I&apos;m not sure where to start. Maybe it would be a<br/>good idea to make a list of these various phenomena or something.</p><p>One thing I can definitely say is that I&apos;m very appreciative of your<br/>ability to introspectively identify exactly what you&apos;re hearing in<br/>such an unconfused manner, and to relate it to all of these other<br/>things you&apos;ve heard before, such as pelog and maqam scales, and then<br/>to state all of those connections clearly enough that I can understand<br/>them from halfway across the country and over a mailing list. I think<br/>I understand your thought process very well when you constantly<br/>identify these intervals which you hear as common across tuning<br/>systems, such as a certain type of pelog fifth which is also sort of<br/>close to 16/11 which also makes an appearance in some mode of rast, or<br/>something like that.</p><p>I&apos;ve been writing the same sorts of descriptions of the things I hear<br/>on here and on other fora, except instead of relating the stuff I&apos;m<br/>hearing to something like maqams or pelog, it&apos;s to MODMOS&apos;s of<br/>porcupine, or to 19-EDO, or to 16-EDO, or to some sort of extended<br/>12-EDO jazz harmony, which are the musical systems I&apos;ve immersed<br/>myself in daily for the past few years. However, I&apos;ve at times been<br/>frustrated, because I rarely seem to find anyone who can understand a<br/>thing I&apos;m saying. Some people on these lists claim to not hear a<br/>network of very clear interval functions, but rather they &quot;just hear<br/>sound&quot;; whether that&apos;s true, or whether they&apos;re just not sure how to<br/>express the functions they do here, I don&apos;t know, but I do know that<br/>I&apos;ve found the process of communication on this sort of level to be<br/>difficult at times. It occurred to me in this discussion that I should<br/>perhaps not take for granted that I am now talking to someone who<br/>seems to think in exactly the same way that I do and who understands<br/>what I&apos;m saying and can respond in kind, and I am grateful for that. I<br/>also think it&apos;s very interesting to see you going through the same<br/>sort of inter-tuning comparison process that I&apos;ve also come to, but<br/>with a totally different set of tunings as a base than those which I<br/>have.</p><p>&gt; To cut to the chase on one fine point, I&apos;d say that major thirds<br/>&gt; in the 13th-14th centuries, or minor sevenths for that matter for<br/>&gt; a composer like Perotin or Machaut who evidently likes them a<br/>&gt; great deal, are analogous to seventh chords in Bach:<br/>&gt; &quot;avoid-in-closing intervals&quot; that signal pleasant and creative<br/>&gt; tension and motion rather than arrival and repose.</p><p>I think I can sort of see what you mean; I&apos;m thinking of Machaut&apos;s<br/>Kyrie here, from the Messre de Nostre Dame, and I guess it&apos;s true that<br/>he never really ends a phrase on a major chord, does he? Maybe that&apos;s<br/>a key aspect of the signaling. Major chords are always sort of the<br/>comma in the middle of a sentence for him, but never a period and<br/>full-stop. But I have to say that the notion that major thirds weren&apos;t<br/>just resolved consonances didn&apos;t really click for me until I heard<br/>Marcel Peres&apos; version of Machaut&apos;s Credo; he sings it in a much lower<br/>register than usual, so that the major thirds start to fall within a<br/>critical band and sound somewhat rough, and adds lots of vibrato to<br/>the thirds. In other words, he does every single thing that you could<br/>possibly do to make a major chord not just sound like a static, calm,<br/>blending 4:5:6 chord. And indeed this works very well: just like<br/>sensory concordance can enhance grammatical musical consonance, Peres<br/>uses sensory discordance to enhance grammatical musical dissonance.<br/>That really blew my mind the first time I heard it; to hear the thirds<br/>suddenly becoming dissonant in a very real, visceral sense.</p><p>&gt; And new patterns do get &quot;activated.&quot; A quick example: the<br/>&gt; movement by Dunstable and Dufay and others toward restful thirds<br/>&gt; leads to a situation where a third can be a relatively and<br/>&gt; eventually quite stable resolution of a more tense interval, and<br/>&gt; specifically of a diminished fifth, e.g. B-F to C-E. Zarlino<br/>&gt; tells us that this is the one dissonance -- unlike seconds or<br/>&gt; sevenths -- that can be written &quot;in the same percussion&quot; without<br/>&gt; benefit of a suspension.</p><p>What does this mean exactly - that it doesn&apos;t have to go B-F -&gt; C-F -&gt;<br/>C-E, or something like that?</p><p>&gt; So while the increasingly &quot;laid-back&quot; nature of major thirds in<br/>&gt; the 15th-century is at first partly a matter of color, and indeed<br/>&gt; may be seen as a _blurring_ of 14th-century directedness where<br/>&gt; these thirds are vital in defining cadential tension (Richard<br/>&gt; Crocker&apos;s insight in the 1960&apos;s), it leads to a new kind of<br/>&gt; directedness in 16th-century polyphony, defining one type of<br/>&gt; frequent cadence. And in later 17th-19th century tonality, this<br/>&gt; theme of &quot;tritone tension&quot; becomes a central organizing<br/>&gt; principle.</p><p>But why, I wonder, are tritones tense?</p><p>I&apos;ve experimented with diatonic scales from 7-EDO to 5-EDO. One really<br/>interesting one is in 52-EDO, 10 10 1 10 10 10 1. In this scale, it<br/>takes me a second to hear the tiny 26 cent half steps as being half<br/>steps, but I inevitably catch on and the whole thing snaps into place.<br/>Once it does, the diminished fifth is dissonant and enjoys resolution<br/>to the major third, as it usually does; if I play I ii iii IV V vi<br/>vii&deg; I, that vii&deg; is definitely recognizable as a diminished chord to<br/>me. However, the diminished fifth is 508 cents; it&apos;s now close to 4/3<br/>and is in fact a better approximation to 4/3 than the actual perfect<br/>fourth of the scale.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2012 6:09:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Your method of calculating the beat rate between two difference tones is quite correct and very nicely explained.

For B:C we have 540.9981 Hz and 661.0165 Hz, or a<br/>&gt; difference of 120.0183 Hz.

When you speak of &quot;percentage of the root,&quot;<br/>&gt; I take this as the lowest tone, rather than the implied<br/>&gt; fundamental of 7:9:11 (here 60 Hz). So here it would be on the<br/>&gt; order of 0.23% if the root is the lowest note, or 1.63% if its<br/>&gt; the fundamental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How to interpret these errors, I&apos;m not sure, aside from knowing<br/>&gt; that the two difference tones may beat around 1 Hz in this<br/>&gt; frequency range for the lowest voice.

I&apos;ll respond as quickly as I can...</p><p>Please let me begin, of course, by wishing you my most sincere<br/>condolences for your family tragedy, and by thanking for a most<br/>generous reply while noting that I&apos;m the one who took longer to<br/>reply in turn.</p><p>&gt; The best way for me to describe it is that it&apos;s &quot;scalar.&quot; I<br/>&gt; have very clear scale degrees in my head which get activated<br/>&gt; when I hear musical intervals. You might call these scale<br/>&gt; degrees &quot;functions&quot; instead, or &quot;categories&quot; or something.<br/>&gt; Perhaps this is &quot;melodic,&quot; I dunno - I don&apos;t know how to use it<br/>&gt; to write catchy melodies, that&apos;s for sure :)</p><p>I&apos;ve often read that really good melody is hard to teach; rules<br/>of counterpoint or maqam modulation might be a bit easier, at<br/>least as a starting point. But it is true that there are lots of<br/>categorical or, as you say, &quot;functional&quot; perceptions.</p><p>&gt; But it&apos;s not intonational, and that&apos;s what I&apos;m sure of, unless<br/>&gt; there&apos;s some secret way in which it is that I&apos;m not aware<br/>&gt; of. Minor chords are &quot;minor&quot; to me whether or not they&apos;re<br/>&gt; 10:12:15 or 6:7:9 or etc; the minor &quot;feeling&quot; is preserved<br/>&gt; regardless, though there are some clear subtle differences in<br/>&gt; mood. And all of my musical emotions seem to be dependent on<br/>&gt; these interval functions first and foremost, and the<br/>&gt; intonations of them secondly.</p><p>While we may be discussing different styles, I find likewise that<br/>a 14th-century cadence in Machaut style like C#-E-G# to D-A might<br/>tune the minor third sonority at 6:7:9, 22:26:33, or indeed the<br/>supraminor 52:63:78 (minor third in MET-24 at 265, 289, or 333<br/>cents), and with a semitone or supraminor step at 57, 81, or 127<br/>cents. The 52:63:78 and 14:13 step are a good example of<br/>&quot;paraschismic&quot; tuning (e.g. Eb-F#-Bb to E-B). But they all seem<br/>like shadings of the same 14th-century &quot;functionality.&quot;</p><p>As George Secor and I found in 2001-2002, though, when we get to<br/>something like 18:22:27 or 22:27:33 with cadential steps like 139<br/>or 150 cents, it&apos;s something else again -- neither major nor<br/>minor, but neutral or Zalzalian. And hearing in terms of the<br/>basic categories &quot;minor - neutral - major&quot; is a bit different,<br/>maybe like recognizing a distinctive vowel in a new language as<br/>something other than a blurring of two familiar English<br/>categories or phonemes. And, of course, traditional Near Eastern<br/>musicians take this for granted as part of their &quot;mothertongue.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  Also, I&apos;ll go out a limb and say that this phenomenon accounts<br/>&gt;  for about 90% of my musical experience, whereas ratios and<br/>&gt;  intonation account for 10% of it. So it seems to me that if I<br/>&gt;  want to experience new and fundamentally different musical<br/>&gt;  emotions, which is what got me into this field to begin with,<br/>&gt;  I need to learn how to perceive a radically new set of<br/>&gt;  interval functions, however I choose to intone them. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;  spent the past few years learning all of this theory which is<br/>&gt;  built around ratios and temperaments and intonation and such,<br/>&gt;  but now it&apos;s clear that in order for me to get to the point I<br/>&gt;  want to, I need to learn to hear music relative to a<br/>&gt;  completely different foundation of functions and scales and<br/>&gt;  dyads.</p><p>What I find is that Near Eastern maqamat are at once a bit the<br/>same (e.g. mostly diatonic tetrachords), and a bit different<br/>(neutral intervals as an everyday, primary reality). But medieval<br/>European rules of polyphony can adapt quite well -- although I&apos;d<br/>emphasize that pure maqam melody is a goal in itself, with any<br/>polyphony making it a different and hybrid art. But the rules<br/>just get expanded a bit, for the most part: &quot;A minor, neutral, or<br/>major seventh often contracts effectively to a fifth, etc.&quot;</p><p>But there are those &quot;radically different&quot; moments, like with<br/>this in MET-24:</p><p>            Xeno-Najdi          Xeno-Hijaz<br/>      |----------------------|--------------|<br/>      F*    G*    Bb   B    C#   D     E*   F*<br/>      0    207   438  565  772  853   1118 1200<br/>        207   231  127  207   81   265    82</p><p>Is that 772-cent interval (264/169, or 18/13 plus 44/39) a small<br/>minor sixth, or some kind of &quot;quasi-fifth&quot;? This is the Battaglia<br/>effect, as in the lower pentachord of 11-EDO machine, 2 2 1 2.<br/>So that &quot;Xeno-Najdi&quot; pentachord really spans &quot;a small minor<br/>sixth&quot;; and that &quot;Xeno-Hijaz,&quot; or maybe &quot;Hijaz al-Tammany&quot;<br/>tetrachord &lt;grin&gt;, a large major third! Yet they can sound like a<br/>pentachord and tetrachord!</p><p>Now change that C# back to the usual C, and we&apos;re back in Kansas,<br/>or maybe Cairo, at least from my perspective of what a &quot;normal&quot;<br/>maqam sounds like:</p><p>               Najdi             Xeno-Hijaz<br/>      |----------------------|----------------|<br/>      F*    G*    Bb   B     C*    D     E*   F*<br/>      0    207   438  565   703   853   1118 1200<br/>        207   231   127  138   150   265    82</p><p>Nadji, 3-3-2-2 in simple 17-step notation, is sort of a Zalzalian<br/>or neutral variation on European Lydian; the upper Hijaz would be<br/>2-4-1. Now tastes might vary: some Near Eastern musicians might<br/>say &quot;We really aren&apos;t into the 8/7 thing here&quot; or &quot;A Hijaz with a<br/>12/11 step sounds more like Persian Chahargah than our local<br/>style,&quot; etc.</p><p>But those are &quot;normal&quot; differences on fine-tuning, etc., as<br/>opposed to a scenario where usual interval perceptions are<br/>getting bent in striking ways!</p><p>&gt;  Half of it seems to be 12-EDO specifically, and half of it<br/>&gt;  seems to be diatonic/chromatic/chain of fifths stuff<br/>&gt;  specifically. When I first started out with different tunings,<br/>&gt;  it was the former - 7/4 sounded &quot;crunchy but wrong&quot; to me at<br/>&gt;  first, because I knew that to split it into two fourths, those<br/>&gt;  fourths would also have to be flat, and then the LLs<br/>&gt;  tetrachord would have to be compressed flat, but that would<br/>&gt;  make the major thirds so flat that three wouldn&apos;t equal an<br/>&gt;  octave...  etc. I just intuitively knew that it would make<br/>&gt;  everything break.  Sooner or later I got over that, by<br/>&gt;  learning to allow the notes in my head to deform a bit to<br/>&gt;  accomodate the new intervals, So I started learning to hear<br/>&gt;  things like 7/4 as a type of minor seventh, and 11/8 as a type<br/>&gt;  of aug 4, etc.</p><p>What strikes me is that you and the RMP approach generally have<br/>taken a much more strenuous and risky artistic path than mine:<br/>you have dared to run the risk of &quot;making everything break.&quot;<br/>For me, starting in 1998 after 30 years of medieval and<br/>Renaissance music played in 12-EDO by default and heard on record<br/>and CD in who knows what intonations, it wasn&apos;t a question of<br/>&quot;breaking&quot; anything, just using the &quot;historically correct&quot;<br/>Pythagorean and meantone tunings.</p><p>Oh, yes, I _was_ interested in 1998 in trying a &quot;what-if&quot;: how<br/>about 24-note Pythagorean on two MIDI keyboards? That kept the<br/>12-note LLs structure securely in place, with 9:12:16 on each<br/>keyboard, and 7/4 also available in lots of places as an<br/>&quot;alternative minor seventh.&quot; By 2001, I was delightedly using<br/>12:14:18:21 as the new fauxbourdon -- and I must record this! --<br/>but, again, with the regular diatonic structure of each 12-MOS<br/>untouched.</p><p>Neutral intervals were an acquired test for me: first mostly<br/>things I played by mistake in 17-EDO, for example; then<br/>&quot;charmingly impressionistic&quot;; then great in supraminor and<br/>submajor flavors as a variation for 14th-century cadences, or in<br/>the guise of an 11/8 wolf fourth in B-Eb-G# to A-E-A, etc; and<br/>finally, during my collaboration with George Secor in 2001-2002,</p><p>So we both went through a process of getting acquainted with 7/4<br/>and 11/8 -- but I never felt the chain-of-fifths framework was at<br/>risk, because it was there on each manual. And this is where I<br/>find it a bit surrealistic to think of Peppermint or MET-24 as<br/>anything but another tuning of the &quot;regular diatonic,&quot; or more<br/>specifically a tweak of Pythagorean. For playing Machaut or an<br/>improvisation in a similar style, the basic &quot;mapping&quot; is<br/>identical to that of Pythagorean -- or 12-EDO, for that matter!<br/>Something like miracle or father or porcupine really is a<br/>different &quot;abstract temperament&quot; in that very concrete musical<br/>sense.</p><p>&gt;  These days, it still seems to be diatonic based though, or<br/>&gt;  maybe I should say &quot;chromatic-based.&quot; If I play in something<br/>&gt;  like 16-EDO, I generally just snap it into my head in terms of<br/>&gt;  some 12 note chromatic scale. But, if I play in 19-EDO,<br/>&gt;  something strange happens. I can now hear a very clear<br/>&gt;  difference between sharps and flats. E-A# is lydian, and E-Bb<br/>&gt;  is diminished. Also, the diesis is now the same size as the<br/>&gt;  chromatic semitone, so I can play resolutions that exploit<br/>&gt;  that and move from things like A#-Bb and hear the whole<br/>&gt;  structure of the tonality swing waaaay across the circle of<br/>&gt;  fifths to the other side.  I think it&apos;s pretty safe at this<br/>&gt;  point to say that I have a set of 19-EDO &quot;categories&quot; which<br/>&gt;  are &quot;perfect&quot; in my head just like 12-EDO&apos;s are; they<br/>&gt;  developed naturally as an outgrowth of the extended meantone<br/>&gt;  structure.</p><p>The A#-Bb thing is really interesting in 19-EDO. In something<br/>like MET-24, there&apos;s a small thirdtone at 57 cents, a bit smaller<br/>than 1 step of 19-EDO, that likewise can be either clearly a<br/>&quot;diesis&quot; (e.g. 4/3 vs. 11/8) or a small semitone. And there&apos;s a<br/>middle thirdtone at 68 or 69 cents that your Lydian example<br/>reminds me of: thus F G A B C or 1/1-44/39-14/11-63/44-3/2 is<br/>Lydian, but F* G* A* B C* or 1/1-44/39-14/11-18/13-3/2 is Najdi.<br/>As in 19-EDO, it&apos;s the distinction between 1/3 and 2/3 of a<br/>tone. But the difference is that in 19-EDO, the usual semitone is<br/>126 cents -- almost identical to my apotome (e.g. C-C#)! And my<br/>normal semitone is 81 or 82 cents, so 57 or 69 cents may be a<br/>less dramatic difference from the diatonic than 63 cents where<br/>126 cents is the norm!</p><p>&gt;  So maybe we can say that it used to be 12-EDO specifically,<br/>&gt;  but now it&apos;s something more general, like diatonic-based or<br/>&gt;  meantone-based or chain-of-fifths based or something. I really<br/>&gt;  don&apos;t know.</p><p>The humorous thing here is that you have gone _far_ beyond me in<br/>exploring things which are definitely not &quot;chain-of-fifths based&quot;<br/>in any usual sense, e.g. 11-EDO or 16-EDO or porcupine!</p><p>&gt;   Right, well, how about 1/1 12/11 8/7 21/16 3/2 12/7 7/4 2/1?<br/>&gt;   Because that&apos;s clearly Dorian for me too, except that now 8/7<br/>&gt;   is a subsubminor third instead of a major second of some<br/>&gt;   sort.</p><p>A good question, and a great holiday gift, because you prompted<br/>me to try an experiment! With 240 cents, say in 20-EDO. I&apos;ve been<br/>familiar with the &quot;quasi-third&quot; effect; and Jacques Dudon has<br/>noted this property of 147/128 or the like. But 231 cents?</p><p>What I learned, thanks to you, is that _timbre is critical_!<br/>In a usual harmonic timbre, 8/7 doesn&apos;t seem quite enough to pull<br/>off the quasi-third effect, although this is a game of horseshoes<br/>where &quot;almost&quot; does count: it&apos;s a wonderful hypermodern sound,<br/>and quite distinct from either 8:9:12 or 6:7:9.</p><p>But now for the critical step you prodded me to take last night:<br/>&quot;Try a softer timbre, for example one designed for 14-EDO.&quot; And I<br/>found that 1/1-8/7-3/2 _could_ be like 6:7:9, or 1/1-8/7-3/2-12/7<br/>like 12:14:18:12. In this timbre, also, 32/21 made a satisfying<br/>fifth for a cadential resolution! So we might speak of &quot;timbreing<br/>out the 49/48.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s mostly toning down the critical band<br/>stuff and beating, leaving more room for a &quot;thirdlike&quot;<br/>impression.</p><p>&gt;  If you can also hear 1/1-8/7-3/2 as minor in the context of<br/>&gt;  the above scale, instead of sus2, then all I can say is that I<br/>&gt;  think that&apos;s a really, really significant thing, not just a<br/>&gt;  trivial sort of curiosity. In my mind, that completely makes<br/>&gt;  the concept of &quot;learning how different JI chords&quot; work<br/>&gt;  meaningless. How does 1/1-8/7-3/2 work?  Is it a sus2 chord,<br/>&gt;  as in your scale, or a minor chord, as in my scale? When I<br/>&gt;  &quot;detwelvulate&quot; my ears to hear things in some supposedly more<br/>&gt;  natural way, what&apos;s the &quot;correct&quot; way to hear the chord? It&apos;s<br/>&gt;  now obvious that the answer to every single one of these<br/>&gt;  questions is &quot;mu,&quot; to quote a famous Zen koan.</p><p>Indeed the Zen &quot;mu&quot; might be the best answer to lots of these<br/>questions if not all. Basically, as I understand it in crude<br/>terms, &quot;mu&quot; is the illuminating realization that the reality is<br/>beyond the reach of the question, indescribable in those terms.</p><p>But for me, whether 1/1-8/7-3/2 can be like 6:7:9 depends mainly<br/>on timbre: MET-24 (230.9 or 232.0 cents) can do it in my 14-EDO<br/>timbre. And 1/1-8/7-3/2-12/7 is even stronger, if anything, as<br/>12:14:18:21 -- not to mention 14:18:21:24. In a sense, it&apos;s as<br/>much a verb as a noun: how it resolves helps determine which way<br/>I hear it (although someone else deciding the resolution would be<br/>a better &quot;scientific test&quot; of that!).</p><p>But scale structure may very well make a difference in terms of<br/>whether I hear 1/1-12/11-8/7-4/3 as a diatonic rather than<br/>chromatic tetrachord. Your modification to 1/1-12/11-8/7-21/16,<br/>which I can&apos;t do in MET-24 because I don&apos;t have both 12/11 and<br/>21/16 above the same note, is likely crucial. It&apos;s much easier to<br/>hear 240 cents as a &quot;whole-tone&quot; step -- although it can also be<br/>a harmonic quasi-third -- than 265 cents! But 1/1-12/11-8/7-9/7<br/>in MET-24 can be a sort of diatonic tetrachord -- is this a bit<br/>like the 2-2-1-2 &quot;pentachord&quot; in 11-EDO machine?</p><p>&gt;  Well, if you already know how to hear 240 cents as a type of<br/>&gt;  third, I guess the thing I wrote above will be old hat to you<br/>&gt;  :)</p><p>Not exactly, although I appreciate the humor, because 240 cents<br/>is one thing in a usual timbre, and 231 cents another. But with<br/>the right timbre -- maybe more subtracting beats than anything<br/>else -- 231 will do, also. And that _is_ news for me! Thanks for<br/>prompting me to try it out. One sign of the timbre is that<br/>G*-Bb-F at 0-231-935 cents not only has the sweetness of<br/>12:14:21, but can resolve to G#*-E at 728 cents!</p><p>&gt;  I totally agree with this too. 16:24:26:39 is magic. But, I<br/>&gt;  still don&apos;t know if the ratios I just laid out have anything<br/>&gt;  to do with this magicness.</p><p>Exploring different shadings of the neutral intervals could be<br/>very interesting.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This feels a lot to me like starting with a bare 9:7 expanding<br/>&gt;&gt; to a fifth, with the third a bit blurry in a lower or middle<br/>&gt;&gt; register. Either moving to a higher register, or &gt; adding the<br/>&gt;&gt; fourth above so we have 7:9:12 expanding to a &gt; full 2:3:4,<br/>&gt;&gt; clarifies things.</p><p>&gt; Is the root staying the same in both cases?</p><p>A good question, and I&apos;m not sure! My training is mainly to count<br/>intervals from the lowest voice, or think of an outer interval<br/>divided into adjacent ones, like 7:9:12 as 7:12 divided into 7:9<br/>plus 3:4. But maybe the audible root does change -- at any rate,<br/>going from 7:9 to 7:9:12 seems to consolidate things a bit, while<br/>14:18:21:24 has the &quot;anchoring&quot; effect of that 3/2 fifth also.</p><p>Maybe this is a good place to conclude this portion of my reply.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2012 1:13:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[This continues our dialogue from my last reply, with your<br/>following comment directed to the idea that RMP could be focused<br/>on the idea of finding tunings with &quot;nondiatonic but melodically<br/>compelling&quot; modes, etc.]</p><p>&gt;  The RMP outlook doesn&apos;t really address these questions.

It has nothing at all<br/>&gt;  to say about the phenomenon with 8/7 that I presented<br/>&gt;  above. It doesn&apos;t know what parsing is. It just tells you how<br/>&gt;  to find tunings that have nice tempered approximations to<br/>&gt;  simple JI ratios, and lots of them.  Quite frankly, I think<br/>&gt;  that the existing RMP completely fails to explain this side of<br/>&gt;  music, which to my ears comprises about 90% of what I hear,<br/>&gt;  and that we&apos;re in need of some new basic realization to begin<br/>&gt;  a new point of departure, just like Parncutt&apos;s work (among<br/>&gt;  others) served as a point of departure for the existing RMP.</p><p>But maybe RMP has pointed to tunings or MOS sets or whatever<br/>where these kind of psychoacoustical phenomena are likely to<br/>arise -- some of them of interest in more &quot;conventional&quot; systems<br/>also.</p><p>Of course, there are systems like 11-EDO or 13-EDO or 14-EDO<br/>where the intervals simply don&apos;t &quot;add up&quot; as expected. But at<br/>least equally interesting, in a way, are things like a<br/>&quot;pentachord&quot; of 0-207-438-565-772 cents in a system where the<br/>usual 0-207-438-565-703 cents is also available -- and yet we get<br/>the same kind of &quot;aural phenomenon&quot; where 14/9 or a bit larger is<br/>heard as a &quot;fifth.&quot;</p><p>But the applied RMP stuff -- I mean machine and so forth -- can<br/>port to various types of systems where appropriate subsets happen<br/>to turn up. And it doesn&apos;t have to be a port strictly in MOS<br/>form. Thus 0-218-436-545-764 is a MOS, while 0-207-438-565-772<br/>isn&apos;t, but the Battaglia effect of &quot;small minor sixth as<br/>perceived fifth&quot; is there in either.</p><p>[On some of the MOS systems you&apos;ve tried]</p><p>&gt;  A few. All of them are MOS&apos;s with more large than small steps,<br/>&gt;  and where the ratio of large to small step is close to 2/1.<br/>&gt;  Machine in 16-EDO is fairly amazing; I can get into it pretty<br/>&gt;  easily.  That would be the scale 3 3 1 3 3 3.</p><p>Here I&apos;m just quoting a few of the systems you mention where<br/>you&apos;ve given me some ideas.</p><p>The machine thing is pretty amazing, and also the portability of<br/>the Battaglia effect. Was the &quot;small sixth as fifth&quot; effect one<br/>of the purposes of this temperament? Here&apos;s the MET-24 version<br/>I&apos;ve been discussing:</p><p>! met24-xenonajdi6_Fup.scl<br/>!<br/>Curious hexatonic like Najdi (17: 3 3 2 2 3 2 2), 3 3 2 3 3 3<br/> 6<br/>!<br/> 207.42187<br/> 438.28125<br/> 564.84375<br/> 772.26562<br/> 992.57812<br/> 2/1</p><p>&gt;  Sensi temperament doesn&apos;t have any great scales that I like,<br/>&gt;  but the basic idea is that two 9/7&apos;s makes a 5/3 - huge chains<br/>&gt;  of tempered 9/7&apos;s like that sound amazing to me, like deep<br/>&gt;  space or wind or something. I have no idea why it sounds that<br/>&gt;  way, but it does; it&apos;s a completely new, &quot;xenharmonic&quot; sound<br/>&gt;  to me.</p><p>While MET-24 doesn&apos;t have enough 9/7 and 169/132 thirds to<br/>generate a whole subset this way, it does have a large neutral<br/>sixth at 866 or 867 cents (say 33/20 or 104/63) that can divide<br/>into these two large major thirds, something like 439-428 or<br/>428-438. And it is a fascinating &quot;diminished seventh&quot; sonority.</p><p>One resolution has that large neutral sixth expanding to an<br/>octave, The other has it &quot;jazzily&quot; acting like the diminished<br/>seventh it technically is, and contracting to a fifth with a<br/>22/21 step in each outer voice!</p><p>        Eb*  E        Eb*  D*<br/>        B    B*       B    D*<br/>        F#*  E        F#*  G*</p><p>In the first version, the three voices have unequal motions of<br/>three thirdtones (lowest part), one small thirdtone (middle part)<br/>or two thirdtone (highest part) -- 207, 57, or 125 cents. In the<br/>second, we have usual 82-cent semitones in each outer voice, plus<br/>the leap of a 346-cent third (near 11:9) in the middle voice. So<br/>this is one great chromatic progression -- or maybe enharmonic,<br/>with that 57-cent step in the middle voice where the neutral<br/>context is quite different than 1/1-8/7-9/7-4/3 or the like,<br/>where it would just be a small diatonic 28/27!</p><p>So thanks for a great present in keeping with the spirit of the<br/>season! And I realize that it could also occur in a neat mode<br/>where the resolution is more conventionally balanced:</p><p>        Eb*  F*<br/>        B    C*<br/>        F#*  F*</p><p>Here the outer voices move from 104/63 or whatever to 2/1 with the<br/>lower voice moving down by a 14/13 and the upper voice ascending<br/>by a 9/8 or 44/39 (125 and 207 cents). The lower two voices go<br/>from 9/7 to 3/2 with the lower again descending by 14/13, and the<br/>middle ascending by 13/12. So we have all steps this time either<br/>a tone or a neutral second -- in contrast to those semitones or<br/>thirdtones in the other two resolutions.</p><p>&gt; In contrast, Orwell has two 7/6&apos;s tempered to make an 11/8, and<br/>&gt; then three 7/6&apos;s tempered to make a 8/5. Orwell just sounds<br/>&gt; weird and diminished to me; it&apos;s very dark and just sounds<br/>&gt; diminished and messed up. I doubt that there&apos;s some magic<br/>&gt; pattern in the ratios which makes it work that way.</p><p>Well, that gave me an idea: how about a pelog pentatonic taking<br/>the &quot;two 7/6&apos;s&quot; idea and running with it?</p><p>! met24-oceania_C.scl<br/>!<br/>&quot;Orwellian&quot; peloglike pentatonic<br/> 5<br/>!<br/> 264.84375<br/> 554.29688<br/> 704.29688<br/> 829.68750<br/> 2/1</p><p>For slendro, one can just add 21/16 and 7/4; but the pelog<br/>pentatonic is very pleasing to me.</p><p>&gt;  In terms of chromatic scales, 15-EDO seems to be the most<br/>&gt;  &quot;stable&quot; nondiatonic chromatic scale out there that I&apos;ve found<br/>&gt;  other than 12-EDO. In 15-EDO, I need to start grouping 7/6 and<br/>&gt;  8/7 as different versions of the same &quot;thing,&quot; if you will,<br/>&gt;  whereas 6/5 and 7/6 are now completely and obviously<br/>&gt;  different. I &quot;sort of&quot; get the hang of this.</p><p>This (240 or 320 cents) is interesting to compare with 20-EDO,<br/>where it&apos;s 240 or 300 cents, with either as a minor third,<br/>although 240 can also be a whole tone, or 960 a &quot;quasi-sixth&quot;!</p><p>Maybe the situation is something like 15-EDO with 265 and 332<br/>cents -- juxtapositing these above a drone, they seem clearly two<br/>different classes of intervals (minor and small neutral),<br/>although the supraminor qualities of 63/52 could in a different<br/>setting make it more &quot;another kind of minor third, larger than<br/>6/5.&quot; But in 20-EDO, I often regarded 240 and 300 as the two<br/>types of &quot;minor thirds.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  I play in either 19-EDO, 22-EDO, and 16-EDO almost every day,<br/>&gt;  and I have for a year or two now. Maybe I&apos;ll regret saying<br/>&gt;  this, but I expect that I would perform very well,<br/>&gt;  comparatively speaking, on any sort of ear training test for<br/>&gt;  all of these, demonstrating my familiarity with those tunings<br/>&gt;  in a measurable way. Of course, it could well be the case that<br/>&gt;  I perform comparatively poorly, at which point I&apos;d be happy to<br/>&gt;  eat those words and humbly ask what sorcery you&apos;re all<br/>&gt;  partaking in which allows you to hear completely novel 22-EDO<br/>&gt;  interval categories, where 7/6 and 6/5 are as different as 6/5<br/>&gt;  and 5/4, which I have yet to discover.</p><p>Maybe, just to be safe, I should confirm that I don&apos;t claim any<br/>sort of special expertise with 22-EDO. What I know is mostly<br/>parapyth and some meantone or modified meantone for Renaissance<br/>uses. On any of these tunings you play regularly, certainly from<br/>my standpoint, you&apos;re the expert! And your skill, patience, and<br/>creative humor call for much admiration.</p><p>There&apos;s lots more in your reply, but why don&apos;t I leave off and<br/>continue my reply in another post.</p><p>Happy holidays,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2012 11:25:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  The more time I spend in these tunings, the more I realize that<br/>&gt;  there&apos;s a deeper theory that there is to stumble upon, which we<br/>&gt;  don&apos;t currently know. I think that if we administered an ear<br/>&gt;  training test to a lot of people, the people who do best on the ear<br/>&gt;  training test will be the people who also have had the same<br/>&gt;  realization. I have come to conclude that in situations where 6:7:9<br/>&gt;  and 10:12:15 sound the same, they&apos;re &apos;supposed&apos; to sound the<br/>&gt;  same. Then, once that&apos;s accepted, one can then start looking for<br/>&gt;  times when they&apos;re &apos;supposed&apos; to sound different. For instance,<br/>&gt;  hedgehog temperament in 22-EDO is a scale which suddenly makes it<br/>&gt;  very easy to distinguish between 7/6 and 6/5, and it&apos;s given by 3 3<br/>&gt;  2 3 3 3 2 3. I have no idea how or why this works; I feel like I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;  made some progress towards understanding this, but that I only know<br/>&gt;  half of the picture.</p><p>A similar question: is there a &quot;difference in kind&quot; between 332 and<br/>357 cents -- which might both be neutral, but the first more<br/>supraminor and the second in the higher central range? One Turkish<br/>view is that while 357 cents would be a very low Rast (by Turkish<br/>standards where &quot;low&quot; means around 16/13), 332 could actually be<br/>Nahawand, a maqam with a minor third often in practice around 32/27<br/>but sometimes around 6/5 or even higher.</p><p>[On 14-EDO as having good cadences, but outside diatonic structure]</p><p>&gt;  Yes, I absolutely agree with this. I didn&apos;t mention 14-EDO above<br/>&gt;  because I&apos;m still new to it, but I think there&apos;s magic to it. In<br/>&gt;  14-EDO, 5/4 and 6/5 become two different intonations of the same<br/>&gt;  thing, and 7/6 and 8/7 become two different intonations of the same<br/>&gt;  thing. Also, 14-EDO magically contains all of the touch tone<br/>&gt;  intervals on your phone. There is definitely something interesting<br/>&gt;  about 14-EDO.  However, I have trouble hearing 5/4 and 6/5 as just<br/>&gt;  two different versions of the 14-EDO neutral third.</p><p>The touch tone thing is interesting! The 943-cent interval is great in<br/>place of 12/7 or 7/4, although I&apos;m not sure if it exactly represents<br/>either -- maybe more substitutes for either. And likewise with 5/4 and<br/>6/5 -- or maybe 14/11 and 13/11 or whatever other regular thirds one<br/>is used to. I tend to guess I might be perceiving things something in<br/>this way: &quot;Well, it expands to a fifth in a familiar way by stepwise<br/>motion in each voice -- so it&apos;s some kind of third!&quot; Or, similarly,<br/>&quot;It contracts to a unison by stepwise contrary motion, and doesn&apos;t<br/>have enough of a critical band effect to make it a whole-tone, so it&apos;s<br/>a third!&quot; That last might apply to the 8/7 effect we&apos;ve been<br/>discussing.</p><p>[On radically nondiatonic systems as like a new natural language]</p><p>&gt;  Yes, I think so; specifically I think this happens when I try to<br/>&gt;  play in really radically nondiatonic tuning systems. I just keep<br/>&gt;  hearing 12-EDO patterns and I&apos;m not sure what sorts of things to<br/>&gt;  play which convey to my brain a really strong, and most importantly<br/>&gt;  &quot;stable&quot;, sort of novel pattern in the new tuning system, so that<br/>&gt;  my brain is likely to gravitate to this new pattern and not the old<br/>&gt;  broken 12-EDO patterns it ends up hearing instead, corresponding to<br/>&gt;  my brain trying</p><p>And with some of these patterns, they might be more general than<br/>12-EDO itself: e.g. &quot;a major sixth from three generators fairly near<br/>3/2 expands to a 2/1 octave.&quot; That could nicely apply to 19-EDO or<br/>1/3-comma meantone in the 16th century, or 22-EDO today -- with the<br/>fifth at around 695 or 709 cents. But it doesn&apos;t apply in the usual<br/>way to the systems we&apos;re discussing.</p><p>   &gt;&gt; Here it might be helpful to do studies of individual styles, and<br/>   &gt;&gt; then try to generalize. I can articulate some 14th-century<br/>   &gt;&gt; European relations, but other people know 18th-century European<br/>   &gt;&gt; relations better, or maqam, or gamelan, and so forth.</p><p>&gt; What sorts of relations do people hear?</p><p>Well, probably most familiarly for many people here, the kinds of<br/>harmonic progressions in late 17th-19th century European music often<br/>represented by Roman numeral analysis, and so forth. Or the kinds of<br/>13th-14th century European structures discussed by writers of the time<br/>and by a modern scholar such as Sarah Fuller. Or the relationship<br/>between Rast and Bayyati in a scheme of Near Eastern maqam modulation.</p><p>&gt;  Yes, this is exactly how I hear it too! But I wonder, is classical<br/>&gt;  conditioning all that there is to resolutions, or is there some<br/>&gt;  scale-theoretic reason which makes the tritone resolution more<br/>&gt;  &quot;forceful&quot; than the double leading tone cadence? In other words, if<br/>&gt;  we imagine that the listener is constantly maintaining a copy of<br/>&gt;  the scale in his/her head at all times, is there some<br/>&gt;  scale-theoretic reason why the tritone resolution might &quot;refresh&quot;<br/>&gt;  more of this scale than the double leading tone resolution, or is<br/>&gt;  it just classical conditioning?</p><p>Since I actually find 14th-century cadences more compelling than<br/>18th-century cadences -- although each is compelling in the context of<br/>its own style, and tastes vary -- maybe I might offer a friendly<br/>amendment and ask: &quot;Why do tastes vary so much on this?&quot;</p><p>Since for 30 years I preferred 14th-century cadences while playing or<br/>improvising in 12-EDO, that may control one variable, at least, and<br/>support your view that often intonation isn&apos;t the main issue!</p><p>What I&apos;ve found is that &quot;scale-theoretic&quot; approaches often can<br/>identify ways that the modal languages of the 13th to early 17th<br/>centuries differs from 18th-19th century tonality -- and that the<br/>&quot;anomalies&quot; from a tonal perspective that they identify are often the<br/>reason I prefer the earlier styles!</p><p>I remember sharing one of my favorite Spanish pieces around 1500 with<br/>one of these tonal theorists -- a quite expert scholar! -- and getting<br/>the comment, &quot;Of course, having C and C# juxtaposed like that is fine<br/>in modality, but would be impossible in tonal music!&quot; I wouldn&apos;t<br/>necessarily have known that such a progression would be positively<br/>excluded in tonality, but I knew that I preferred the 16th-century<br/>approach to accidentals: more fluid and varied, it felt to me.<br/>But that&apos;s also a biased description, and doesn&apos;t stop me from<br/>enjoying Bach, any more than people who find tonality more coherent or<br/>compelling aren&apos;t prevented from enjoying Machaut.</p><p>Sometimes intonation can simply accentuate the fact that very<br/>different kinds of &quot;parsing&quot; are going on for people mainly oriented<br/>to different styles. For example, the following approximates pretty<br/>closely a monochord-based interpretation by Jay Rahn of the cadential<br/>intonations advocated by Marchettus de Padua in 1318:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>One listener who&apos;s a very skilled musician remarked that since these<br/>thirds and sixths aren&apos;t so harmonious, I really shouldn&apos;t have<br/>&quot;landed&quot; on them. The answer, of course, is that those aren&apos;t<br/>&quot;landings,&quot; they&apos;re cliffhangers -- interrupted cadences with an extra<br/>intonational edge. But the very fact I had to explain this suggests<br/>that different patterns of conditioning are involved.</p><p>&gt;  So if I understand correctly, you flattened the third harmonic of<br/>&gt;  the timbre to 655 cents, and then 764 cents sounded like a<br/>&gt;  fifth...? I would have expected that if anything, sharpening the<br/>&gt;  third harmonic to 764 cents would have made this happen more...</p><p>The short story is that likely I mostly detuned the partials to the<br/>point where a &quot;sine wave&quot; situation resulted where 655 or 764 cents or<br/>almost anything larger than a tone could be quite &quot;concordant,&quot; with<br/>lots of room for creatively blurred impressions.</p><p>&gt;  While you&apos;re in 22-EDO, you may want to play in hedgehog, which is<br/>&gt;  3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3. If you&apos;re like me, that 3 3 2 is very clearly some<br/>&gt;  sort of do re mi fa, except the &quot;mi&quot; is 6/5, and the &quot;fa&quot; is 9/7,<br/>&gt;  which is apparently a shade of perfect fourth today...</p><p>Here 3 3 2 is for me more like re-mi-fa -- Dorian, say -- plus some<br/>kind of chromatic step where I might expect sol. But in MET-24,<br/>playing pure melody without a drone to give any harmonic clues, I find<br/>that Bb*-C-C#*-Eb at 0-150-334-439 cents can suggest do-re-mi-fa. The<br/>fourth might be low by 57 cents from the tempered 4/3, but it sounds<br/>like a slightly inflected &quot;fourth&quot; rather than something really<br/>&quot;nondiatonic.&quot; So 150-184-105 cents can create the effect you&apos;re<br/>describing for me. But Bb-B*-C# at 0-184-334 cents, or 184-150 cents,<br/>is more re-mi-fa. So the order of steps can make difference. With the<br/>two identical steps of 22-EDO, 164-164 cents, I may lean to re-mi-fa.</p><p>&gt;  This is probably part of it; it&apos;s also been shown that the tendency<br/>&gt;  towards virtual pitch integration increases as the VF gets higher<br/>&gt;  in pitch. So as the 9/7 gets higher, there may be more of a<br/>&gt;  tendency to hear it as (1):7:9, where the (1) is a virtual<br/>&gt;  fundamental which you can hear if you focus on it. For me, I need<br/>&gt;  only to imagine the 9/7 as part of a rootless (4):7:9 to totally<br/>&gt;  transform the sound of it to something much more musically<br/>&gt;  consonant.</p><p>Maybe the root is the mechanism; one way I&apos;ve heard it put is that<br/>thirds get less &quot;muddy&quot; in higher registers. By the way, Paul Erlich<br/>would have dialogues where he was surprised that I found 12:14:18:21<br/>smoother and less tense than 4:6:7:9, with the later still a very<br/>intense kind of &quot;concord,&quot; but not so easy to &quot;bask&quot; in by comparison<br/>with 12:14:18:21. Maybe 12 isn&apos;t the root, but has 3/2 and 7/4 as<br/>&quot;anchoring&quot; harmonics.</p><p>&gt;  Perhaps... I would suspect, however, that this sort of analysis<br/>&gt;  makes ratios into a procrustean bed we&apos;re fitting something to,<br/>&gt;  whereas the fundamental thing we&apos;re hearing is something much<br/>&gt;  deeper and related to the properties of scales. I think that<br/>&gt;  14:18:21 sounds like root-major third-fifth, not the other way<br/>&gt;  around, with the latter being the thing which is truly<br/>&gt;  &quot;fundamental&quot; - at least to a 12-EDO listener. That being said, I<br/>&gt;  can&apos;t claim that I really know what&apos;s going on.</p><p>I agree that 14:18:21 is simply one possible tuning of &quot;a fifth<br/>split into major third below and minor third above&quot; -- and the way<br/>that type of sonority gets handled depends more on the style or<br/>&quot;musical grammar&quot; than on the exact intonation!</p><p>&gt;  In the context of the scale 2 2 1 2 2 2, if I go up to the octave<br/>&gt;  and then go two whole steps down, it sounds like a small minor<br/>&gt;  sixth, whereas if I go up from the tonic via 2 2 1 2, it sounds<br/>&gt;  like a large perfect fifth - to my ears, anyway.</p><p>We agree there, and I find it the same in MET-24! Going up, it&apos;s a<br/>large fifth, completing a pentachord. And the concluding &quot;tetrachord,&quot;<br/>actually a trichord, of course, 764-982-1200 in 11-EDO or 772-993-1200<br/>in MET-24, sounds kind of strange; but that &quot;strangeness&quot; is localized<br/>with the upper genus, not the pentachord that has gone before. But<br/>descending, it sounds like those two whole-tones are part of a<br/>tetrachord of Kurdi or Phrygian, octave-minor7-minor6, where the<br/>expected fifth to complete the genus would be the actual 3/2. So we<br/>seem on the same wavelength here!</p><p>&gt;  So you&apos;re saying that at first, it seems like some sort of<br/>&gt;  stretched major chord, right? But then, once you resolve it in the<br/>&gt;  manner you describe, your perception of the chord changes<br/>&gt;  -retroactively-, right?  I hadn&apos;t thought about this before, but I<br/>&gt;  totally agree that this happens, though not for me this time - it<br/>&gt;  required repeated listens for me to &quot;decipher&quot; what was happening.</p><p>Yes, although I know that there was another view -- like seeing first<br/>a human face in one of those optical illusions, then two vases, but<br/>knowing while looking at those vases it could be a face also.</p><p>&gt;  Ironically, after this discussion and a year or so&apos;s worth of<br/>&gt;  parallel offlist discussions with Keenan Pepper, I&apos;m now starting<br/>&gt;  to feel like we have -too many- different leads! But the question<br/>&gt;  that I have which lurks underneath all of this is: how are all of<br/>&gt;  these different concepts - classical conditioning of resolutions,<br/>&gt;  scale-based and non-ratio-based &quot;function&quot; assignment of intervals,<br/>&gt;  retroactive reidentification of functions, ease of distinguishing<br/>&gt;  intervals in a scale if they&apos;re all as far apart from one another<br/>&gt;  as possible (haven&apos;t mentioned this yet but it&apos;s true), formation<br/>&gt;  of a &quot;map&quot; of said functions (haven&apos;t talked about this yet either<br/>&gt;  but it&apos;s also true) in a novel tuning system - what is the<br/>&gt;  underlying theme that unifies all of these things? What are we even<br/>&gt;  talking about? I&apos;ve got a &quot;eureka&quot; ready to go if anyone can figure<br/>&gt;  out what part of reality we&apos;re even discussing here...</p><p>It does get really complicated, and I would be more interested in<br/>finding pleasing progressions, melodic or vertical, than in coming up<br/>with some Grand Unification Theory of music.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is how I heard it after four or five listens. What happened<br/>&gt;&gt; with me when I listened to the segment that you describe is - at<br/>&gt;&gt; first, I clicked right to the chord, and heard it as a completely<br/>&gt;&gt; foreign and atonal sort of thing; couldn&apos;t figure it out at<br/>&gt;&gt; all. Then I heard it resolve to the A-D-E and A-C-E, and knew I was<br/>&gt;&gt; at the right place.  Then I tried listening again, a few bars<br/>&gt;&gt; earlier, and still it sounded very strange when that chord came<br/>&gt;&gt; up. Then after a few more listens, I started hearing the chord as a<br/>&gt;&gt; sort of augmented chord, which then resolved to A-D-E and then to<br/>&gt;&gt; A-C-E. Now that I know what it is, I can immediately snap it into<br/>&gt;&gt; that sort of augmented framework. (You may be labeling the note<br/>&gt;&gt; names differently; I&apos;m just describing what I hear.)</p><p>Your note names are fine! And your detail is really, really<br/>interesting!</p><p>I might add that while A-C-E is unstable, at 6:7:9 it&apos;s one of the<br/>mildest and most concordant of unstable sonorities, maybe illustrating<br/>David Doty&apos;s observation (if I correctly remember him as the source)<br/>that a consonance can very effectively resolve to an even greater<br/>concord, here the 3:2 fifth Bb-F.</p><p>[On the force of accustomed diatonic patterns, e.g. in 12-EDO]</p><p>&gt;  I am personally very familiar with this phenomenon. I think that my<br/>&gt;  problem is that when I play in radically nondiatonic scales, there<br/>&gt;  are a lot of 12-EDO things which constantly &quot;take priority&quot; in my<br/>&gt;  head. I suspect that there&apos;s some way to play things in a tuning<br/>&gt;  system like 10-EDO, for instance, which would be so &quot;strong&quot; due to<br/>&gt;  unknown factors that almost any listener hearing would have to<br/>&gt;  interpret those in this novel &quot;strong&quot; way instead of some old<br/>&gt;  12-EDO &quot;best I could do&quot; sort of way. If only I knew how...</p><p>Actually, what just occurred to me is a possible example of a 12-EDO<br/>pattern that could contribute to the success of this mode, with the<br/>lower &quot;pentachord&quot; having the Battaglia effect. Again, I&apos;m calling<br/>this genus in a maqam context Najdi al-Tammany, because this relates<br/>to machine, and Tammany Hall was one of the greatest political<br/>machines of all time! The upper &quot;tetrachord&quot; is Hijaz.</p><p>          Najdi al-Tammany        &quot;Hijaz&quot;<br/>     |-----------------------|----------------|<br/>     F*    G*    Bb    B     C#   D      E*   F*<br/>     0    207   438   565   772  853    1118 1200<br/>       207   231   127   207   81    265   82</p><p>With machine proper, the lower &quot;pentachord&quot; could really sound like<br/>something covering a &quot;fifth,&quot; but the upper 218-218 or 220-207 or<br/>whatever sounded &quot;different,&quot; at least when heard in itself, say<br/>descending from the octave. You noted that, and I agreed.</p><p>Here, though, that upper &quot;Hijaz tetrachord&quot; (actually here spanning<br/>about 428 cents) can sound rather convincing, too. Why, when that<br/>&quot;tetrachord&quot; is a thirdtone narrow -- and assuming this is pure<br/>melody, without a drone to show that the &quot;fourth&quot; is actually a major<br/>third?</p><p>A possible factor: the steps are 81-265-82 cents. From my maqamic<br/>point of view -- as an alien student, not a Near Eastern musician! --<br/>we can make this same genus routine simply by shifting C# to C*,<br/>getting C*-D-E*-F* or 0-150-415-498, close to 12:11-7:6-22:21.</p><p>But there&apos;s another side to this: the actual 81-265-82 cents might not<br/>be too different from the pattern of 100-300-100 cents in 12-EDO, just<br/>with the semitones and the minor third a bit compressed from a 12-EDO<br/>perspective. At any rate, it sounds rather conventional by comparison<br/>with that 218-218 or 220-207 cents thing in machine proper as the<br/>upper &quot;tetrachord.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  Well, I note that I hear the stretched fifth even with normal<br/>&gt;  timbres - in the scale 2 2 1 2 2 2, it&apos;s fairly hard to avoid for<br/>&gt;  me. What happens if you use a very relaxed timbre, like an ocarina<br/>&gt;  sound?  I know that for me, even with normal timbres, if I load up<br/>&gt;  2 2 1 2 2 2, play a root-third-fifth triad and transpose it up and<br/>&gt;  down the scale, I hear something like C-E-G -&gt; D-F-A -&gt; E-G-C -&gt;<br/>&gt;  F-A-D -&gt; etc, sort of a gospel-ish hexatonic thing. I&apos;m aware that<br/>&gt;  it&apos;s not really the 12-EDO version of that, but that&apos;s the<br/>&gt;  resemblance that I sort of hear.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried experimenting with a bit of two-voice counterpoint or<br/>three-voice parallelism a bit like fauxbourdon -- except that<br/>fauxbourdon implies some fully stable fifths to resolve to! What I<br/>would guess so far -- too early really to tell -- is that the<br/>&quot;major-third-and-fifth&quot; thing may be like a &quot;supersaturated solution,&quot;<br/>not hard to experience at certain moments, but not a very settled<br/>state.</p><p>&gt;  Did you hear the tonic chord in &quot;tonal study in orgone&quot; as being<br/>&gt;  some sort of root-major third-fifth? That was also 7:9:11.</p><p>While the counterpoint and rhythmic energy captured most of my<br/>attention -- and well! -- my overall impression was some etude or the<br/>like in minor, although at the end I heard the touch of a major<br/>third. Maybe I would have been a better judge in my younger years:<br/>this dynamic range, quite typical for piano music of course, does tend<br/>to have me either set the volume &quot;safely&quot; so that I miss a lot in the<br/>quieter parts, or else give too much of my attention to adjusting the<br/>volume setting on the fly so that I can hear the quieter things and<br/>then turn things down for the later parts.</p><p>&gt;  Yes, I absolutely agree with this. I strongly suspect that<br/>&gt;  microtonalists are secretly manipulating 12-EDO/western/common<br/>&gt;  practice/etc functions and categories in their heads when they play<br/>&gt;  in extended JI, but then ascribe those powers to something like a<br/>&gt;  set of ratios. This is just a hunch, though; there may be some<br/>&gt;  among us who truly do hear a completely novel set of interval<br/>&gt;  functions which are radically unlike anything we&apos;re used to in<br/>&gt;  12-EDO, and where 7/6 is its own novel interval class, not just a<br/>&gt;  sort of minor third. However, if these sorts of &quot;enlightened&quot;<br/>&gt;  listeners are among us, they seem to be the silent lurker type...</p><p>As to the JI question, I&apos;d say I mostly agree. In MET-24 we have<br/>&quot;near-JI&quot; where 22:26:33:39 and 12:14:18:21 are two alternative<br/>shadings of &quot;minor-thirdness and minor-seventhness.&quot; They&apos;re musically<br/>interchangeable, and I like having two subtly different choices.</p><p>There are two areas, sometimes but not necessarily connected with JI,<br/>where &quot;radically different&quot; things can happen. The first is small<br/>intervals. Having heard of LaMonte Young doing something like this, I<br/>discovered that moving _very slowly_ back and forth above the same<br/>drone between 16:21:24:28 and 18:24:27:32 brings out 64/63 as a<br/>distinct melodic step. There&apos;s nothing like this in 12-EDO. And it&apos;s<br/>very effective in MET-24, with 0-472-703-968 and 0-495-703-996 cents,<br/>where the 64/63 is actually tempered down to around a Pythagorean<br/>comma.</p><p>The other area is neutral intervals, and also intervals around 250,<br/>450, 750, and 950 cents, for example; rather early on, I found that<br/>24-EDO was &quot;out of this world&quot; with the latter intervals. And in<br/>2001-2002, George Secor and I found together that certain cadences<br/>with neutral steps were definitely distinct from anything familiar to<br/>us -- neither of us then having a grounding in Near Eastern music.</p><p>&gt;  In terms of the actual effect caused by isoharmonic chords, which<br/>&gt;  is what we were calling &quot;periodicity buzz,&quot; it&apos;d have some sort of<br/>&gt;  effect, but the 17 cents being off would definitely make the whole<br/>&gt;  thing not seem to buzz in sync with itself. Though, after<br/>&gt;  everything above, it now seems to me to be rather unlikely that the<br/>&gt;  fundamental qualia of our musical experience are ratios, or that we<br/>&gt;  really fundamentally hear things &quot;as&quot; ratios at all...</p><p>The question of the actual qualia is a really intriguing one, and I&apos;m<br/>open to various solutions. With the isoharmonic or &quot;isodifference&quot;<br/>thing as Dave Keenan calls it, he points out that the beat rates for<br/>the differences are a good test, and I should analyze this to see what<br/>the result is.</p><p>&gt;  I feel the same way. For me, my head has been a chaotic swirl of<br/>&gt;  these ideas for the past year; I&apos;m desperately trying to find a way<br/>&gt;  to organize it all, but I&apos;m not sure where to start. Maybe it would<br/>&gt;  be a good idea to make a list of these various phenomena or<br/>&gt;  something.</p><p>The machine thing is _very_ impressive, and as a melodic pentachord<br/>perception, the Battaglia effect as I call it seems quite &quot;portable&quot;<br/>to different tunings. In a 17-step notation, it would be 0-3-6-8-11<br/>steps, or 3-3-2-3, for that pentachord. And it&apos;s thanks to you that I<br/>played around with this &quot;pentachord&quot; and found 3-3-2-3|1-4-1 with that<br/>upper 81-265-82 cents likewise sounding like a &quot;tetrachord.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  One thing I can definitely say is that I&apos;m very appreciative of<br/>&gt;  your ability to introspectively identify exactly what you&apos;re<br/>&gt;  hearing in such an unconfused manner, and to relate it to all of<br/>&gt;  these other things you&apos;ve heard before, such as pelog and maqam<br/>&gt;  scales, and then to state all of those connections clearly enough<br/>&gt;  that I can understand them from halfway across the country and over<br/>&gt;  a mailing list. I think I understand your thought process very well<br/>&gt;  when you constantly identify these intervals which you hear as<br/>&gt;  common across tuning systems, such as a certain type of pelog fifth<br/>&gt;  which is also sort of close to 16/11 which also makes an appearance<br/>&gt;  in some mode of rast, or something like that.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to draw connections -- but I realize that there are<br/>lots that other people, including yourself, know more about! For<br/>example, from your discussions and those of others, I know that jazz<br/>involves some very complex harmonies where there could be all sorts of<br/>microtonal nuances. And it&apos;s fascinating how some kinds of special<br/>effects like the Battaglia effect in machine might port to various<br/>tunings and styles.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;ve been writing the same sorts of descriptions of the things I<br/>&gt;  hear on here and on other fora, except instead of relating the<br/>&gt;  stuff I&apos;m hearing to something like maqams or pelog, it&apos;s to<br/>&gt;  MODMOS&apos;s of porcupine, or to 19-EDO, or to 16-EDO, or to some sort<br/>&gt;  of extended 12-EDO jazz harmony, which are the musical systems I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;  immersed myself in daily for the past few years. However, I&apos;ve at<br/>&gt;  times been frustrated, because I rarely seem to find anyone who can<br/>&gt;  understand a thing I&apos;m saying.</p><p>That can be a kind of mutual predicament when people are coming from<br/>different places. But you do communicate well, for example with that<br/>Gospel type of progression in 11-EDO machine. Some of it is a bit like<br/>fauxbourdon or maybe a 16th-century hymn setting, with the stepwise<br/>motion in the bass very natural to me. And the extended jazz harmony<br/>is one really creative field in all this!</p><p>&gt;  Some people on these lists claim to not hear a network of very<br/>&gt;  clear interval functions, but rather they &quot;just hear sound&quot;;<br/>&gt;  whether that&apos;s true, or whether they&apos;re just not sure how to<br/>&gt;  express the functions they do here, I don&apos;t know, but I do know<br/>&gt;  that I&apos;ve found the process of communication on this sort of level<br/>&gt;  to be difficult at times.</p><p>A lot of it may be putting it (always inexactly, but still helpfully)<br/>into words! And on the 7:9:11 thing in my piece _O Europa_, and the<br/>radically different thing in machine, it&apos;s fascinating how we were<br/>able to explain our experiences.</p><p>&gt;  It occurred to me in this discussion that I should perhaps not take<br/>&gt;  for granted that I am now talking to someone who seems to think in<br/>&gt;  exactly the same way that I do and who understands what I&apos;m saying<br/>&gt;  and can respond in kind, and I am grateful for that. I also think<br/>&gt;  it&apos;s very interesting to see you going through the same sort of<br/>&gt;  inter-tuning comparison process that I&apos;ve also come to, but with a<br/>&gt;  totally different set of tunings as a base than those which I have.</p><p>Yes, I need to remember that patterns very familiar to me are not<br/>necessarily so to others! We may often be in much the same<br/>situation.</p><p>&gt;  I think I can sort of see what you mean; I&apos;m thinking of Machaut&apos;s<br/>&gt;  Kyrie here, from the Messre de Nostre Dame, and I guess it&apos;s true<br/>&gt;  that he never really ends a phrase on a major chord, does he? Maybe<br/>&gt;  that&apos;s a key aspect of the signaling.</p><p>What I might say is that while some 13th-14th century composers<br/>(putting aside some English styles) sometimes end, or better _pause_ a<br/>phrase on a fifth split into lower major and upper minor third (to me,<br/>&quot;major chord&quot; somehow implies that it&apos;s a unit of complete or stable<br/>harmony), it is a pause or possibly an interrupted cadence rather than<br/>a real completion. Adam de la Halle does this in the later 13th<br/>century. We open on F-C-F, and he pauses at the end of a phrase on<br/>G-B-D -- with the form either immediately returning to F-C-F, a<br/>logical resolution, or else continuing in a last brief phrase taking<br/>us to the same destination. So the signal is: &quot;We&apos;re not through yet,<br/>even if you were expecting we might be!&quot;</p><p>&gt;  Major chords are always sort of the comma in the middle of a<br/>&gt;  sentence for him, but never a period and full-stop.</p><p>Exactly!</p><p>&gt;  But I have to say that the notion that major thirds weren&apos;t just<br/>&gt;  resolved consonances didn&apos;t really click for me until I heard<br/>&gt;  Marcel Peres&apos; version of Machaut&apos;s Credo; he sings it in a much<br/>&gt;  lower register than usual, so that the major thirds start to fall<br/>&gt;  within a critical band and sound somewhat rough, and adds lots of<br/>&gt;  vibrato to the thirds. In other words, he does every single thing<br/>&gt;  that you could possibly do to make a major chord not just sound<br/>&gt;  like a static, calm, blending 4:5:6 chord. And indeed this works<br/>&gt;  very well: just like sensory concordance can enhance grammatical<br/>&gt;  musical consonance, Peres uses sensory discordance to enhance<br/>&gt;  grammatical musical dissonance.  That really blew my mind the first<br/>&gt;  time I heard it; to hear the thirds suddenly becoming dissonant in<br/>&gt;  a very real, visceral sense.</p><p>This makes sense: the lower register could do it, just a high register<br/>can make 14:18:21 seem quite blending. Similarly, as Paul Erlich and I<br/>once discussed, tempering a major third at 415 cents rather than 81/64<br/>at 408 cents could maybe underscore the message that this is _not_ a<br/>mistuned 5/4 but something else again. But these things are very much<br/>enhancing the musical grammar. The fact that people describe thirds<br/>either as &quot;imperfect concords&quot; or as &quot;tolerable dissonances&quot; suggests<br/>that &quot;pleasant but unstable&quot; is the general idea. But for people<br/>accustomed to a stable 4:5:6, it&apos;s the dissonance and instability that<br/>can use some underscoring like you&apos;re describing in Peres.</p><p>[Concerning Zarlino on the diminished fifth as permissible to sound<br/>with both notes &quot;in the same percussion&quot;]</p><p>&gt;  What does this mean exactly - that it doesn&apos;t have to go<br/>&gt;  B-F -&gt; C-F -&gt; C-E, or something like that?</p><p>Actually it&apos;s a fairly subtle point having to do with the preparation<br/>rather than the resolution. For example, he permits:</p><p>       F   F   E<br/>       A   B   C</p><p>His point is that B-F can be sounded together, as well as in the kind<br/>of a suspension that could also be applied to other dissonances such<br/>as a sixth or seventh:</p><p>       F       E<br/>       A   B   C</p><p>In both uses, the freer as well as the conventionally suspended<br/>diminished fifth (with F already sounding when B is sung), it is<br/>expected that a consonance precedes the dissonance. And it&apos;s optional<br/>to use another suspension at the fourth in the course of the<br/>resolution, for example</p><p>       F    F      E   F<br/>       A    B   C      F</p><p>And in four voices we sometimes get things like this:</p><p>      F      E  F<br/>      B   C     C<br/>      F   G     A<br/>      D   C     F</p><p>So we start with a tritone above the bass on the sixth degree<br/>of the mode, then a resolution of the highest voices B-F to C-E<br/>elaborated by a suspension of the kind you were describing while the<br/>bass moves to the fifth degree, and then a usual cadence with the bass<br/>failing a fifth while an upper voice rises by a semitone. But the<br/>tritone sonority, basically a minor third plus major sixth, can and<br/>does also just resolve directly to a cadence on the step below:</p><p>      F   E<br/>      B   C<br/>      F   G<br/>      D   C</p><p>This would be a frequent half-cadence internally, but generally not so<br/>conclusive.</p><p>&gt;  But why, I wonder, are tritones tense?</p><p>A fair question, and the answer would seem to be, &quot;They need not<br/>always be so, as in Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic with a stable 4:5:6:7<br/>tetrad.&quot;</p><p>In historical European music, the first reason might be a perception<br/>of the tritone as a &quot;wolf&quot; fourth or fifth -- something close to, but<br/>not quite, what you wanted if you were looking for 3/2 or 4/3! I<br/>experienced this myself in 1966 when I found out in high school how<br/>much I enjoyed &quot;parallel fourths and fifths&quot; -- the names of the<br/>intervals were new to me! -- and hit an unexpected dissonance: &quot;Is<br/>this piano out of tune?&quot; Answer: &quot;No, you just played a tritone.&quot;<br/>So it&apos;s sort of &quot;dissonant&quot; by force of an odious comparison.</p><p>That didn&apos;t mean it wasn&apos;t used, only that it was considered<br/>definitely unstable. And as thirds because increasingly stable, that<br/>instability resolving specifically to a third for the diminished<br/>fifth, or sixth for the augmented fourth, becomes one important<br/>ingredient of certain 16th-century cadences.  Around 1600, it gets<br/>used in a way that results in a seventh above the bass also, something<br/>that by around 1670 or 1680 becomes a standard part of the new scheme<br/>of organization which would be called &quot;tonality,&quot; where it represented<br/>&quot;V7-I&quot; in the later Roman numeral system. And in this key system, the<br/>location of the tritone was central to defining a key, if I understand<br/>correctly.</p><p>But something like 7/5 or 11/8 might well be treated as relatively<br/>concordant or even stable; some people have suggested that 8:11:13 may<br/>have special properties making it quite consonant.</p><p>So, while I was focusing on historical European understandings, they<br/>needn&apos;t apply to other styles or musics: you asked the right question!</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;ve experimented with diatonic scales from 7-EDO to 5-EDO. One<br/>&gt;  really interesting one is in 52-EDO, 10 10 1 10 10 10 1. In this<br/>&gt;  scale, it takes me a second to hear the tiny 26 cent half steps as<br/>&gt;  being half steps, but I inevitably catch on and the whole thing<br/>&gt;  snaps into place.  Once it does, the diminished fifth is dissonant<br/>&gt;  and enjoys resolution to the major third, as it usually does; if I<br/>&gt;  play I ii iii IV V vi vii? I, that vii? is definitely recognizable<br/>&gt;  as a diminished chord to me. However, the diminished fifth is 508<br/>&gt;  cents; it&apos;s now close to 4/3 and is in fact a better approximation<br/>&gt;  to 4/3 than the actual perfect fourth of the scale.</p><p>First of all, just a humorous aside. I looked at 52-EDO in Scala and<br/>said to myself, &quot;Isn&apos;t this curious: lots of these intervals match<br/>MET-24 within a cent or two!&quot; Then I realized that 52-EDO was a subset<br/>of 104-EDO, even closer to the O3 or POTE tuning!</p><p>But carrying the 12-17-22-27-32-37-42-47 series to 52 -- something I<br/>hadn&apos;t even thought of -- is fantastic! And your result made me try<br/>this in MET-24 with success, although a less dramatic example:</p><p>           Eb   D<br/>           A*   Bb<br/>          520c  415c</p><p>Here a 520-cent wide fourth contracts to a 415-cent major third, with<br/>the lower voice moving up by a comma at 23.4 cents, and the upper<br/>voice descending by a regular semitone at 82 cents. But it sounded<br/>quite recognizable, if not quite what Zarlino had in mind &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>&gt;  Thanks,<br/>&gt;  Mike</p><p>With thanks and best wishes for a Happy New Year,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
