In ancient times it<br/>had been discovered that there was a certain<br/>psychological &quot;resonance&quot; aroused in listeners when<br/>sounds produced on otherwise identical strings having<br/>length ratios 2:1 or 3:2 and compound ratios derived<br/>from these ratios were heard.  Then by the 16th<br/>century ratios of 5 in string lengths were recognized<br/>as being significant in musical harmony (Zarlino).  Until the<br/>17th century, when the overtones were discovered by<br/>Galileo and Mersenne, it was believed that somehow<br/>the numbers themselves had been assigned a mystical<br/>importance by the Creator.  After the discovery of<br/>the overtones, it was realized that there were physically<br/>unique properties - not always completely understood -<br/>possessed by pairs of sounds having small integer frequency<br/>ratios one to another.  In a &quot;Dictionary of the Arts...&quot;<br/>quoted from in Jorgenson which had been published in<br/>1764, the author states that in the quarter comma<br/>mean tone temperament, which he speaks of as the common<br/>or vulgar temperament, there are small departures from<br/>the true frequency ratios for the fifth, the minor<br/>third, and the diatonic 16/15 and chromatic 25/24<br/>semitones of 1/4 comma or in modern terms, about 5.4<br/>cents.  He states that although these departures from<br/>the just ratios can be clearly heard, they do not<br/>impair the quality of the music performed in this tuning<br/>system.  The UCSD music library has quite a few 19th<br/>century musical tomes and they usually have rather<br/>elaborate schemes of integer frequency ratios depicted<br/>in articles on musical harmony and intonation - some<br/>are in languages which I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>I may be being misunderstood as to what I mean by music<br/>in just intonation.  I mean music in which the notes are<br/>produced at pitches called for by the harmonies being<br/>sounded.  A 12 per octave keyboard tuned in a &quot;just intonation&quot;<br/>scheme can only produce a limited number of harmonies where<br/>the frequencies of all the notes are in just intonation.<br/>If one tries to play many other chords as if the keyboard<br/>were in equal temperament, one will sound many dissonant<br/>chords so that the result would not be very harmonious and<br/>it certainly wouldn&apos;t be in just intonation, although there<br/>have been people who have done just that in order to<br/>demonstrate how terrible just intonation sounds!  Such a<br/>&quot;demonstration&quot; could be presented very convincingly, but<br/>it would be deceptive.</p><p>Dave Hill,  Borrego Springs, CA</p></div>
