To use a more extreme<br/>example to illustrate the point, I wouldn&apos;t recommend<br/>&quot;borrowing&quot; into tuning-specific terminology, words like<br/>&quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;boring&quot;.</p><p>Hi Gary,</p><p>I was indeed aware of the use of &quot;pure&quot; as a JI synonym...<br/>My carrying on is/was slung in the direction of the extreme<br/>(and only the extreme) &quot;entangled  baloney...&quot; that can/does<br/>(but that is not to say _automatically_ will/does) accompany<br/>tuning related usage of the words &quot;pure...&quot; and &quot;just...&quot;<br/>and &quot;tempered...&quot; [But as I&apos;m probably in violation of a<br/>general consensus cease and desist order here -- I&apos;d best<br/>stop my yakin!]</p><p>Dan</p></div>
