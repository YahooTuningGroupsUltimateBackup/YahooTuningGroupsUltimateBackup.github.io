I&apos;m delighted. We can use all the help we can get.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is my opinion that timbre plays greatly into this perception, and<br/>&gt; *one will be deceived by doing these experiments with anything other<br/>&gt; than the human voice, such as synthesized tones.*</p><p>You&apos;re not the first on the list to have suggested this, Jacky. And, if we<br/>hit a wall with the synthesized jerries, that&apos;s the first place we&apos;ll go.<br/>Live strings is another possibility.</p><p>Last year, I posted some vocal examples of the high third. As I remember, we<br/>didn&apos;t have a any offers to put these on a spectrum analysis (or whatever).<br/>That may also be a way to go.</p><p>Actually, I think we&apos;re making some progress with the synthesized jerries.<br/>At least we are getting some agreement on which are the &quot;best.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The human voice is continuously variable - changing moment to moment.<br/>&gt; One can see this if they record the wave form and &quot;look&quot; at it in an<br/>&gt; audio editor, as compared with a synthesized timbre. It&apos;s two<br/>&gt; entirely different sound worlds.</p><p>I&apos;ve already noticed that when I dropped Paul&apos;s examples into my LogicAudio<br/>software. Very strange looking waveforms. Symmetrical and sterile looking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe if you really want to find out what this &quot;exact&quot; relative<br/>&gt; frequency&quot; is, you&apos;ll will have infinitely better perception of this<br/>&gt; interval/effect by using samples of real human voice. One could play<br/>&gt; these intervals on a digital sampler. I would suggest making some<br/>&gt; recordings of long held tones (this is how I frequently work), then<br/>&gt; experiment with different intervals until you find out what it is.<br/>&gt; With long held tones, rather than looped ones, one will better<br/>&gt; emulate the sound of actual singing. I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll find it<br/>&gt; (easily) referencing with a synthesized waveform.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure &quot;easily&quot; is a term that&apos;s going to be any more applicable to a<br/>&quot;nervous system&quot; pitch than to a synthesized one. But then, who knows what<br/>may turn up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I weren&apos;t so busy, I&apos;d help you out, but I&apos;m slammed on so many<br/>&gt; levels right about now, but I do find this interesting.</p><p>Okay, Jacky, you&apos;re off the hook. You just have to agree to buy the book<br/>when it comes out. :-)</p><p>(Privately, I&apos;m hoping you can&apos;t sleep at night thinking about our search<br/>for the high third and feeling guilty about not getting involved. ZAP! ZAP!<br/>ZAP!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Regarding mp3, I&apos;m not the guy to comment. My understanding is that mp3 is<br/>&gt;&gt; sorta &quot;stripped down&quot; for speed. It may be subject to &quot;categorical<br/>&gt;&gt; perception.&quot; (Do you like that, Paul?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MP3 in my opinion will distort such an experiment as much as trying<br/>&gt; to base the results on listening to synthesized timbres, if one does<br/>&gt; not use a very high birate. 192 kbs, perhaps as a minimum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good Luck,<br/>&gt;<br/>Good luck accepted. Thanks.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=35757 href="#35757">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 12:25:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Last year, I posted some vocal examples of the high third.
