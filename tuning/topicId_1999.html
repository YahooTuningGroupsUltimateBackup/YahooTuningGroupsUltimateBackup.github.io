They all sounded &quot;right&quot; to me,<br/>each with its own unique contribution to the overall<br/>effect of the chord, thus my inspiration for writing the<br/>piece.  But the 4/3 certainly did fit in with the harmonics<br/>4:5:6:7.  I frequently used the 4/3 *as* the bass when<br/>the piece cycled around to this particular version,<br/>giving a chord of 8:12:15:16:18:21,  but it didn&apos;t sound<br/>as good in the bass as the 1/1 [i.e., 12 in these proportions].</p><p>And Paul also suggested, in discussion of the actual<br/>subject under debate, that the most likely rational<br/>interpretation for the &quot;sharp 9th&quot; in the &quot;Jimi Hendrix<br/>chord&quot; was 7/6, whereas I had said 19/16.</p><p>I still prefer the sound of the 19/16 in my &quot;sharp 9th&quot;<br/>chords, but I had to admit that Paul was right (as usual),<br/>and that based on guitar and finger mechanics, Jimi&apos;s<br/>&quot;sharp 9th&quot; could be called most likely a 7/6.</p><p>And recently, I&apos;ve posted about my favorite &quot;major 7th&quot;,<br/>11/6.  Since I said that here, and discussion has been<br/>agreeing that 11/8 sounds less consonant (or whatever<br/>is the proper term) than 13/8, and Erlich&apos;s Harmonic<br/>Entropy shows &quot;stronger&quot; minima at 11/6 than at 11/8,<br/>I&apos;ve been comparing my feelings when hearing 11/8<br/>and 11/6, and have decided definitely that 11/6 is<br/>going to be more useful in my music than 11/8.</p><p>Haven&apos;t tried 13/12 yet, but all this leads me to<br/>think that the proper lattice metric for these harmonics<br/>of 3^-1 would connect them also with n^0 [1/1], and,<br/>measuring from n^0,  be shorter than the higher-numbered<br/>(more-complex) harmonics of n^0 that are nearby in pitch.</p><p>-Monzo</p><p> |\=/|.-&quot;&quot;&quot;-.

Both chords contain a 21/16 interval<br/>&gt; that is best tempered away. Even better than 12-tET for this is<br/>&gt; (surprise) 22-tET, due to its better 7/6 and 7/4. Alternative rockers<br/>of<br/>&gt; the future, take note!</p><p>OK, possibly I described your &quot;evaluation&quot; or description<br/>of these chords the wrong way, but, lacking the original<br/>reference right now, I *can* quote you from memory as saying:</p><p>&gt; &quot;what is the 4th? Is it 11/8? 21/16? 43/32. No - it&apos;s<br/>&gt; just plain old 4/3 . . .&quot;</p><p>The &quot;no&quot; sounded like a discard to me.</p><p>And, since rational interpretation of ET notes was the<br/>subject of the original discussion (and not the other way<br/>around, which is what you describe above), my point was<br/>that *all* of those ratios &quot;work&quot; as a &quot;4th&quot; in a JI<br/>version of that chord.  I proved it (at least to myself)<br/>by writing the piece.</p><p>But I *would* love to hear some real alternative rock in 22-ET . . .<br/>how &apos;bout it, Paul?</p><p>And what do you mean by &quot;a 21/16 interval that is best tempered<br/>away&quot;?  Is that implying that there&apos;s something intrinsically<br/>wrong with the JI versions? Or that the ET versions are intrinsically<br/>better?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Haven&apos;t tried 13/12 yet, but all this leads me to<br/>&gt; &gt;think that the proper lattice metric for these harmonics<br/>&gt; &gt;of 3^-1 would connect them also with n^0 [1/1], and,<br/>&gt; &gt;measuring from n^0,  be shorter than the higher-numbered<br/>&gt; &gt;(more-complex) harmonics of n^0 that are nearby in pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So are you starting to lean towards a triangular lattice? (That would<br/>&gt; accomplish what you&apos;re saying).<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think I *started* to lean towards a triangular lattice before<br/>I even created my first lattice, back when I started drawing<br/>3^x * 5^y matrix diagrams (similar, as it turned out later,<br/>to the ones in the Tipple &amp; Frye book) based on Partch&apos;s<br/>diagonal Diamonds.</p><p>I only modified it to rectangular because of my theories<br/>on the importance of the prime-factors in musical perception.</p><p>I&apos;d say that I&apos;ve been leaning ever heavier towards triangular<br/>ever since my realizations of the consonance of these 3^-1 harmonies<br/>*in a chord built on n^0* a few years ago, and particularly<br/>strongly since our discussion of last year.</p><p>At the same time, tho, I feel that my lattice diagrams<br/>have reached a level of complexity where the triangular<br/>connections are best left off, because I think it would<br/>look too confusing if I included them.</p><p>I generally don&apos;t think higher than a 13-prime-limit<br/>because of the complexity of the diagram, with the<br/>exception that I like 19/16 a lot, so I use it.<br/>(Also, as I pointed out here, 19 pops up in a lot<br/>of historical tuning systems, which I&apos;ve diagrammed)</p><p>But if I tried to show all the triangular connections<br/>on even an 11-prime-limit lattice, the density of connecting<br/>vectors would go contrary to my purpose for using the<br/>lattice in the first place - its excellence at portraying<br/>the many varied numerical relationships at a glance.<br/>It would look like scribbling.</p><p>Some of the lattices I&apos;ve done of Sims&apos;s and Young&apos;s<br/>tuning systems already resemble that, even without<br/>triangulation.</p><p>And with my recent idea on how to incorporate<br/>ETs, JI, and octave-reduction into the same lattice,<br/>it&apos;s quite packed with geometry and text already.</p><p>I don&apos;t disagree with you about the relevance of<br/>composites *or* triangular connections in regard<br/>to sonance of dyads, and perhaps I can even agree<br/>in regard to larger harmonic structures over a 1/1.</p><p>But in regard to understanding a particular tuning<br/>system, *as a whole*, especially one with many notes,<br/>or indeed to understanding *all* tuning systems<br/>taken together (in terms of their JI implications),<br/>IMO, prime-factoring can&apos;t be beat.</p><p>And from that, I extrapolate to the idea that<br/>prime-factors have some kind of harmonic significance.<br/>Perhaps it&apos;s along the lines of what I said above,<br/>regarding multiple dimensions of sonance.</p><p>-monz<br/> |\=/|.-&quot;&quot;&quot;-.
