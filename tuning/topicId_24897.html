And<br/>I know I said I&apos;d shut up on this one already, but this is the only<br/>thread I have the desire to excavate out of the 300 plus post deep<br/>pile at the moment...</p><p>From where I stand, and this has been my gripe right along because as<br/>I&apos;ve already said in what I&apos;ve heard the musical results are plenty<br/>accurate enough, Johnny appears to want his cake and eat it too.<br/>Arguing both sides of the argument as it were.</p><p>Whatever, would somebody who&apos;s equipped, competent, and driven to do<br/>so -- preferably without an agenda -- run some measurements and just<br/>see what there is to see alright already!</p><p>Johnny&apos;s accomplishments, reputation (et al) shouldn&apos;t be in doubt.<br/>However, as he&apos;s also the one who keeps bring this rather provocative<br/>&apos;I play 1200-tet accurately to the cent&apos; topic back every now and<br/>again, I also see no reason to shout-down or belittle anyone who might<br/>honestly question that or someone who might be interested in running<br/>some measurements to see just what&apos;s what.</p><p>Then again, there always JdL&apos;s new list...</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
