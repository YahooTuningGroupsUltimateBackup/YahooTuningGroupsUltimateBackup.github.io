I guess that adds a bonus to Porcupine as a notational basis for 15-ET...though, a pentatonic notation based on Blackwood[10] has NO wrap-around steps, consecutive letters are always the same interval, unless altered by accidentals....</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When music students first learn standard meantone-based notation, how do they learn that A-C is a minor third but C-E is a major third, A-G is a perfect fifth but B-F is a diminished fifth, and so on?
