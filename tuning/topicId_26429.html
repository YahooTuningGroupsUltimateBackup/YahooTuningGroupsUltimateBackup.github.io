Purity lies in the<br/>simplicity of a ratio.  This is why a perfect 3:2 ratio or fifth sounds far<br/>superior to an approximation.  This is true even if the approximation is<br/>close.  I believe that approximations due to an ET system significantly<br/>debase the original purity of the ratios, no matter how close the<br/>approximation is.  A listener&apos;s perception has a great deal to do with the<br/>quality of the intervals which they will accept.  Some people are willing to<br/>accept trade-offs for the sake of &quot;modulation.&quot; Modulation was not built into<br/>these ratios, and modulation is not an inherent quality of pitch.  It is only<br/>a human contraption designed to give us &quot;artificial&quot; flavors within the<br/>confines of a system with a set amount of pitches.  The reality is that<br/>nature is infinite and does not work with a set palette of pitches.  ANY<br/>pitch can be a new reference just as well as any other.  Everything is also<br/>not equal.  Equality must be forced.  Equality also takes out the real flavor<br/>of music.  This is obvious when one compares all of the 7 &quot;major&quot; modes as<br/>being the SAME SCALE.  Everything in any ET system is really one of the same<br/>thing because everything is the same.  There is no real variety.  Any variety<br/>that is perceived is only the result of an ILLUSION due to the shifting of<br/>references.  This is ridiculous.  Real ratios do not do this.  Each ratio has<br/>a singular identity, and when that identity is alterned, all of the relations<br/>are altered with it.<br/>    There is nothing that is &quot;acceptable&quot; if acceptable is your word<br/>referring to cultural conditioning.  I prefer not to live in an illusion<br/>where I believe that consonance is based on approximations and not the real<br/>thing.  To me, modulation can live in its own artificial state, and I can<br/>choose the pure ratios.  Any ET system is artificial and will never represent<br/>the pure ratios accurately because it is uncapable of doing so.  Anything is<br/>deemed acceptable on my own terms, not on what other people convince me of.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>PageWizard</p></div><h3><a id=26448 href="#26448">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 12:58:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PageWizard17@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt;Anything is<br/>&gt;deemed acceptable on my own terms, not on what other people<br/>&gt;convince me of.</p><p>Well then you won&apos;t mind if other musicians deem things acceptable on<br/>their own terms, which may be different from yours.</p></div>
