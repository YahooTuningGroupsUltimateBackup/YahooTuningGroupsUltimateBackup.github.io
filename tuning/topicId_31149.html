If they play Paris, it&apos;ll probably will be the one in Paris, not<br/>here in Texas, oh well....</p><p>Speaking of, they got me playing bass on some songs (and keyboards on the<br/>rest) with my current band, a bilingual prog-metal project called Mirror<br/>Image.  We just started out so no gigs lined up yet.  I&apos;ve been trying to<br/>get the lead guitarist into microtonal stuff; I throw quarter tones into my<br/>keyboard stuff a lot (I think that just bugs everybody to death, if they<br/>even care).</p><p>I&apos;d like to do a cover of &quot;Roundabout&quot; by the way....</p><p>~DaW~</p><p>Q: How many bass players does it take to change a light bulb?<br/>A: Four.
