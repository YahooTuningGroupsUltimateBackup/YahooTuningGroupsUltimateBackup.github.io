My algebra suggests that it should do.</p><p>Be careful, Tom. You said &quot;the average of pressure times particle<br/>velocity over a cycle&quot;. This makes sense for a single sine wave,<br/>where there&apos;s no problem determining what constituted a &quot;cycle&quot;. In<br/>reality, the physical formula involves an integral of this product<br/>over time, divided by the length of time integrated over (that&apos;s the<br/>definition of &quot;average&quot; used). For a periodic function, this will<br/>clearly give the same answer as long as you&apos;re integrating over an<br/>integer number of cycles. For the sum of two sine waves, though,<br/>there isn&apos;t a clear choice of &quot;cycle&quot;. You have to make a judgment,<br/>based on some exogenous criteria, on what time scale it&apos;s most<br/>appropriate to integrate over. These exogenous criteria in the case<br/>of the human ear dictate a time scale much less than a second. So it<br/>*is* meaningful, from the perspective of the human ear, to consider<br/>the sum of two sine waves whose frequency differs by 1 Hz to be a<br/>signal whose power varies from essentially zero to a maximum and back<br/>every second. If the frequency of the two sine waves differs by many<br/>times more than 1 Hz, you do not hear the beating, and the<br/>appropriate integral for calculating sound power spans many cycles of<br/>what would otherwise be &apos;beating&apos;. It doesn&apos;t make sense to consider<br/>two sine tones which don&apos;t audibly beat against one another (because<br/>their frequencies are too far apart) to result in a varying level of<br/>sound power, and indeed the appropriate calculation comes up with a<br/>nearly constant power.</p><p>So, unfortunately for you perhaps, &quot;sound power&quot; isn&apos;t something that<br/>can be pinned down quite as uniquely as certain other physical<br/>quantities, such as energy . . . Even the most professional VU meters<br/>must make some choice for the time scale over which to integrate; and<br/>this time scale has to have some correspondence with the human ear<br/>for the meter readings to be meaningful . . .</p></div><h3><a id=63483 href="#63483">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 4:41:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so if you stuck a microphone with a decibel meter there, the<br/>meter<br/>&gt; would go up and down.</p><p>It might, depending on what time scale the decibel meter integrates<br/>over.</p><p>&gt; That is my main point.
