Defining exactly what you mean by certain intervals by<br/>&gt;     defining them fuzzily.<br/>&gt; 2. Defining a tuning by connecting the scalar degrees with fuzzy<br/>&gt;     intervals, and stating how important each is to you.<br/>&gt; 3. Letting an algorithm find the best compromise, either before the<br/>&gt;     performance or in response to which degrees are sounding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to see what you think about how my system compares<br/>&gt; with yours.

Look at Pauls graphs<br/>at the harmonicentropy site and that was what I was going for,<br/>although what I&apos;ve come up with is far more wiggly and has<br/>many more local minima (it seems to approximate a somewhat<br/>sharper set of ears, but is configurable, which produces<br/>interesting alternative interpretations for what it comes<br/>up with).</p><p>Theoretically one would take a diatonic scale with a random<br/>large and small step, drop it on the curve and see where it<br/>settles. But for diatonics, the search space is small enough<br/>that brute force works just fine, just walk through all values<br/>and then see where the local minimum are and why.</p><p>Currently, it treats all notes (and modes) with equal<br/>importance, which may not be as limited as it sounds.<br/>For instance, if a 9/8 shows up as a trough that a certain<br/>scale degree aligned with, its probably more indicative<br/>of the strength of the 3/2 it provides in one of the<br/>rotations.</p><p>It is still in the &apos;toy&apos; stage, where I&apos;m not confident<br/>enough in the goodness of its approach to let it generate<br/>the 10 scales to take to a desert island with me. But<br/>it is allowing me to graple with some things I was thinking<br/>about and working out in long hand in a somewhat more<br/>efficient manner. (Only somewhat because, as is usually<br/>the case using computers, you get the data to answer your<br/>original question accompanied by a ton of stuff that,<br/>with luck, prompts better questions and sometimes is<br/>just scruff).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the interst,<br/>&gt;</p><p>Shore, hope to have something intelligent to say when<br/>I read more in your paper.</p><p>Bob</p><p>&gt; -m<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/16/2001 2:24:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Currently, it treats all notes (and modes) with equal<br/>&gt; importance, which may not be as limited as it sounds.<br/>&gt; For instance, if a 9/8 shows up as a trough that a certain<br/>&gt; scale degree aligned with, its probably more indicative<br/>&gt; of the strength of the 3/2 it provides in one of the<br/>&gt; rotations.</p><p>You didn&apos;t mention the rotations in your explanation of this, so<br/>Michael may be confused.
