The numbers<br/>occur and react in patterns, and those patterns are what give<br/>us pleasure in listening to, creating, or even just contemplating<br/>music.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>Yes, I have often woundered about all of this.</p><p>I read somewhere that numbers have &quot;personalitys&quot;, a term which has struck<br/>me as very apt, and has stayed in my mind to this day.</p><p>I have screeds of information to look through, and borrow from librarys all<br/>over New Zealand.</p><p>I have been acused by people on the alternative tuning list of &quot;naughty<br/>number games&quot; myself, in the nicest possible way, of course!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>:o)</p><p>It also brings to mind the question as to weather the mind creates<br/>mathematics, or mathematics creates the mind, or both, Universe&apos;s in the<br/>Polyverse with different mathematics, logically inconsistent, logically<br/>consistant, or simply things we can&apos;t possibly imagine.</p><p>(Rathermatics, Lathermatics, Tathermatics, Omni-Matics, Ultra-matics,<br/>Hyper-matics ect....).</p><p>One thing that really interested me was the effect of &amp; 0 on n, where by<br/>this was different for all real numbers.</p><p>We get x&amp;0=x^(1/x), and for even numbered negative numbers:</p><p>-1&amp;0=-1^1=-1,<br/>-2&amp;0=-2^(1/2)=i(2^(1/2)),<br/>-3&amp;0=-3^(1/3)=+/-(3^(1/3)),<br/>-4&amp;0=-4&amp;(1/4)=i(4th root 4), or i(4^(1/4)),<br/>ect......</p><p>Thus brings to mind the effect of i&amp;0, which should be an imaginary<br/>multiplyed by itself an imaginary number of times.</p><p>I have since been told, that there is no need to have yet another class of<br/>numbers for these, which I had assummed would be called &quot;Ludicrous/Lunatic<br/>numbers&quot;, and I believe that this is called &quot;DeMoive&apos;s theorem&quot;, but don&apos;t<br/>quote me on this-I am &quot;opelezz&quot; at spelling, as you all should know by now.</p><p>Whereby, we do not have any such number as &quot;imaginary imaginarys&quot;.</p><p>Thus (2&amp;(1/12))&amp;0 should not be = to 1, as I first had thought, but = to<br/>1.154018752^(1/1.154018752)=1.32165073=<br/>0.053909752/0.025085832=214.901 cents.</p><p>Blooming strange!!!!!!!!</p><p>{SNIP} oops!!!! (Cut an electron open, and cosmolons (pre-electrons) have<br/>filled the screen-----&gt;+ (there&apos;s one now))  :o)</p><p>This is one of the reasons I have likened recent work in tuning<br/>theory (including my own) to that of quantum physics and<br/>modern astronomy.  All three disciplines seem to me to be dealing<br/>with the same kinds of concepts and perceptual/cognitive processes.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>Yes, and you may have forgotten to mention what I call the &quot;Holy Tricotomy&quot;,</p><p>                      Quantum Mechanics<br/>                        /            \<br/>                       /              \<br/>                      /                \<br/>                     /                  \<br/>                    /                    \<br/>          Chaos (Non-Linear dynamics)----General Reletivity</p><p>BTW, I was meaning to say......</p><p>I got some misleading information from &quot;A Breif History of Time&quot; about the<br/>Strong Anthroptic Principal, and I woundered if it was intentionaly done, or<br/>an editorial blunder?</p><p>Am thinking about using Hamilton&apos;s Quarterionians in the combination with p,<br/>j, &amp; 0, in 4D, and was also woundering, is their non-commutative property a<br/>necessity, not intuitively obviously grasped by me (relevant to DeMoive&apos;s<br/>theorem)?</p><p>I mean, do NO numbers behave in such a way that a*b does not = b*a, unless<br/>we &quot;call the shots&quot;, so to speak?</p><p>I thought I was onto a roll with logs of negatives and imaginarys, and<br/>Ludicrous numbers, wanting to make new numbers &quot;willy nilly/ad hoc&quot;-but a<br/>mathematician I E-Mailed recently burst my bubble.</p><p>Oh yes, and finally, you know the Lambdbda matrix (spelling again, I&apos;m<br/>sorry.....),-as a link from Joe Monzo&apos;s really cool amazeingly neat site, I<br/>was woundering, would it be possible to have a hexagonal version of this,<br/>whereby:</p><p>   a b<br/> c d e f<br/>   g h</p><p>OR</p><p>  a   b<br/>c d e f g<br/>  h   i</p><p>I wounder how you&apos;d multiply them?</p><p>These may not be completely worthless-Buckminsterfuller believed that<br/>reality was based on<br/>60 degrees, not 90.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Sarn.</p></div><h3><a id=2868 href="#2868">ðŸ”—</a>Azi Vajravai &#x3C;vajravai@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/1999 9:29:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Speaking of number games.<br/>Has anyone on this list checked out Phil Thompson&apos;s Organised Chaos?<br/>It&apos;s fractal algorhythmic music that sounds phenomenal.
