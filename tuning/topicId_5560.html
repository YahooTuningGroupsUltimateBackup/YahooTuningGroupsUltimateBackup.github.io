I<br/>emailed him with a correction on his entry on Godel&apos;s theorem and he fixed<br/>it up pretty quick. I think he is aware of his limitations, and I hope he<br/>can fix the entries in the music encyclopedia, but isn&apos;t information on<br/>tuning a little harder to come by, and terminology a little more<br/>nonstandard than in mathematics? If so, how is one to know who to believe?</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
