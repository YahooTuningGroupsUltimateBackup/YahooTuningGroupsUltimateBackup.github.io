Then there is use of actual bird song recordings, which is interesting,<br/>but doesn&apos;t really count as transcription of it.</p><p>Then there are sonograms by the hundred, but they have little in the way<br/>of pitch resolution, you can&apos;t even easily tell nearest 12-tet note.</p><p>So I&apos;m still on the search for any material on the subject, with no success so far.<br/>Would be interested to hear if you have found anything, or turn anything up at a<br/>future stage!</p><p>Bird-song waves look pretty much sinusoidal a lot of the time. So I&apos;m planning<br/>to make my previous attempts at transcribing by ear more accurate by actually<br/>counting waves, and calculating the frequency for a particular number of waves.</p><p>In order to do this, I plan at some time to make a small Windows App to count<br/>waves - idea is you show the wave form, can play any section of it, then ask it<br/>to find the average frequency for that section exactly by counting waves and<br/>measuring the time for the whole waves it found.</p><p>One could also mark out a number of sections by hand in one go (click and drag markers,<br/>play button will play which ever section you click on, etc.), and get it to show all the<br/>pitches and times for them, plus rests for the ones in between, and so automatically<br/>transcribe the entire phrase for you.</p><p>It&apos;s still v. much at the planning stage, and also, I wonder if there is any tool<br/>available that will already do this, or something like this, to high pitch resolution.</p><p>Anyone know?</p><p>I found while transcribing by ear that often what seems like a single note is actually<br/>made up of a number of discrete microtones when you listen to it carefully, and play<br/>one section at a time.

Late in this 10 hour film, a young<br/>composer, Hermann,<br/>&#x9;(who later becomes the central figure of the far longer sequal, &quot;Die<br/>Zweite Heimat&quot;)<br/>&#x9;is experimenting with electronically maniplated birdsong. It must be<br/>the 2nd or<br/>&#x9;3rd episode from the end. I don&apos;t really remember the music, but it<br/>is there,<br/>&#x9;and Hermann is dissatisfied with his effort, which involves<br/>expensive<br/>&#x9;new electronic equipment he is just learning his way around. &quot;No,<br/>the sound<br/>&#x9;must be destroyed more,&quot; he exclaims at one point.</p><p>&#x9;The musical piece sets up a dramatic twist, for when it is<br/>performed, only the<br/>&#x9;meta-narrator of the whole movie, Glasisch, recognizes the local<br/>birdsong for what it<br/>&#x9;is. In other words everyone else in the home village thinks of<br/>Hermann as now<br/>&#x9;completely alienated, but Glasisch recognizes the influence of home<br/>sounds in the<br/>&#x9;rebellious music.</p><p>&#x9;BTW, there is a LOT of interesting music in both Heimat and Die<br/>Zweite Heimat.<br/>&#x9;In this case, the actual electronic distortions of birdsong are<br/>heard for probably less<br/>&#x9;than a minute, so it&apos;s not really a complete piece, I reckon.</p><p>&#x9;Brendan Frost<br/>&#x9;Washington, D.C.</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2000 2:00:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15133">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15133</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found while transcribing by ear that often what seems like<br/>&gt; a single note is actually made up of a number of discrete<br/>&gt; microtones when you listen to it carefully, and play one<br/>&gt; section at a time.
