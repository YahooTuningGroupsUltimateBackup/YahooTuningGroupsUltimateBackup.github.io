Then I will count any well-temperament with a squirrel index<br/>&gt; above five as non-squirrely, on the grounds that the squirrel index<br/>&gt; for Wendell Well is six.<br/>&gt;<br/>This is arguably a necessary condition for &quot;non-squirrely&quot;, but not a<br/>sufficient condition. The width of the thirds should occur in orderly<br/>sequence, increasing sequentially as we move up by fifths from the<br/>narrowest and diminishing from the greatest width continuing on<br/>around to the narrowest to complete the cycle.</p><p>There are further niceties, some of which I outlined in my answer to<br/>your petition for &quot;desiderata&quot;, that we could add to this to<br/>guarantee maximum conformity to the general historical pattern. Well<br/>temperaments after Werkmeister generally conform rather well to the<br/>criteria for a good tuning he outlined in his famous treatise.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, my Natural Synchronous Well doesn&apos;t quite<br/>meet this added condition, but the reversal of the D-A sequence by<br/>one cent is aurally not terribly significant if at all. It is the<br/>temeprament I could find that best conforms to the historical pattern<br/>while preserving perfect 1.5 and 2.0 ratios all around and that still<br/>comes out anywhere near the Pythagorean comma on the total tempering<br/>(within 0.0058 cents in that case).</p></div>
