However, it rapidly developed<br/>that despite my apparent success at a brief audition, I did not have<br/>the pitch accuracy needed for the ensemble.</p><p>The instructor at this point had a most pleasing resolution: I might<br/>use the hour for an independent study of such topics as the transition<br/>from medieval to Renaissance style (e.g. Dufay). While disappointed in<br/>my lack of vocal pitch control (I had hoped to join a madrigal<br/>ensemble also), I was delighted at this proposal, and began a kind of<br/>tutorial focused on the study of such material as Grout&apos;s music<br/>history text -- and also Willi Apel.</p><p>Both the _Harvard Dictionary of Music_ and the _Historical Anthology<br/>of Music_ became my scholarly food and drink, and I rapidly found<br/>myself immersed in Perotin and the Notre Dame School, Machaut, and the<br/>mysteries of the late 14th century.</p><p>About three years later, while in college, Apel&apos;s _French Secular<br/>Music of the Late Fourteenth Century_ became another central<br/>influence.</p><p>Thus your remark, Joseph, is indeed a high compliment which reflects<br/>one of the great germinal influences of my medieval musical studies<br/>(the general music history course and the tutorial-style study I have<br/>mentioned summing up my academic credentials), but I would emphasize<br/>that reading Willi Apel has been my only connection with this premier<br/>historian and theorist. Indeed, I was 16 years old when my study of<br/>his writings began in 1967 -- many of them going back a considerable<br/>number of years before that.</p><p>One very special influence of Willi Apel on me has been his discussion<br/>of medieval sonorities which might be described, in Tuning List terms,<br/>as having ratios such as 6:8:9, 9:12:16, and 4:6:9. Apel describes<br/>them as &quot;concordant dissonances&quot; or the like, a term more generally<br/>used by medieval theorists to describe the diverse and yet harmonious<br/>sounds of a &quot;concourse&quot; of polyphony.</p><p>Having already become intrigued by these combinations, about two<br/>decades ago I made a survey of world musics and concluded that such<br/>mixtures of fifths, fourths, and major seconds or ninths or minor<br/>sevenths are common in many cultures. From Paul Erlich&apos;s perspective,<br/>I might now add, they might represent &quot;attractors&quot; of low harmonic<br/>entropy.</p><p>I was especially thrilled to find medieval theorists advocating the<br/>use of such three-voice combinations -- especially Jacobus of Liege,<br/>whose views on rhythm had been quoted extensively and ably by Apel in<br/>his _Notation of Polyphonic Music, 900-1600_, but much of whose<br/>complete _Speculum musicae_ (&quot;Mirror of Music&quot;) had only become<br/>available in the published edition of Roger Bragard during the 1960&apos;s<br/>and 1970&apos;s.</p><p>Curiously, during those long years, my intonational experience of this<br/>music (or at least my own playing of it, or improvising in similar<br/>styles) was on keyboard instruments presumably in 12-tone equal<br/>temperament (12-tET). I became interested in the authentic Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and once was obliged by a harpist friend who did tune in pure<br/>fifths (a tuning which sounded pleasing to me in a quite natural way),<br/>but it was not until 1998 that I obtained a used Yahama TX-802 and<br/>could enjoy this tuning as a routine part of my musical experience.</p><p>With due circumspection, please let me say that being associated in<br/>any way with the great Willi Apel is to me a consummate moment, and<br/>may I strive to be worthy of it even while clarifying the actual<br/>history.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16465 href="#16465">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2000 8:26:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
