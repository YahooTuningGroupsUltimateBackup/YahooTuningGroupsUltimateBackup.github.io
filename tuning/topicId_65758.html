This piece is also one of tuning interest as arranged.</p><p>Back in 2003, I analyzed the whole polecat book, but there were some things I was<br/>confused about and some uncertain issues.  Dave Mohr, you brought this one specifically<br/>to my attention.</p><p>Anyway, the tenor-lead minor 3rd on LIGHT-HOUSE, goes from being the top two notes of<br/>a major chord (as 5:6 ratio) to being the top two notes of a seventh chord (a 6:7 ratio if<br/>tuned as a barbershop seventh).  Most people (myself included) agree that it sounds weird<br/>and awkward to hear the lead sharp and the tenor flat as they collapse in on each other.<br/>BUT, and here&apos;s the revelation:  it is barely heard at all when in the full chord context!  The<br/>tenor becomes this background part and the note is less of a scale-note identity and more<br/>of a chord-note identity.  The ear hears the note having its purpose from the chord.  The<br/>lead almost sounds the same, within the chord context.  I think the average listener would<br/>not identify any pitch shift in the lead, within the quartet sound.</p><p>Dave originally argued that most likely the bass and bari would tune to an unchanging<br/>lead, and the tenor would also stay, and we&apos;d have a 5:9 ratio between bass and tenor,<br/>giving a 20:25:30:36 chord.  While this is possible (and I suppose it&apos;d be interesting to<br/>actually make all these comparisons, which I COULD get around to doing), I feel it is best<br/>as I&apos;ve done it.  I&apos;ve preserved the root motion and relative harmonic motion, and I&apos;ve also<br/>got all barbershop sevenths and no compromises in the harmonic content.</p><p>What I did was record the bass and then the lead.  I was decently in tune, but honestly, I&apos;m<br/>no gold-medal singer, even if I have my moments (though I think I have potential with<br/>some hard work...).  And the chance my best moment shows up when the recording is<br/>going is very unlikely, especially since I&apos;m doing all the recording and can&apos;t just focus on<br/>singing.  So much as my takes were not bad, I had to chop up some takes to create a<br/>decent performance.  I also had some wavering and a few off pitches that were simply due<br/>to lack of vocal support.  So I then centered the bass and lead on the analyzed notes, but<br/>did not adjust the wavering or vibrato.  I then sang tenor and bari along with that.  I found<br/>that quite a decent portion of the tenor and bari notes that I sang were off by less than 2<br/>or 3 cents, some were right on (meaning Melodyne analyzed that the center of all the<br/>wavering and vibrato was at a certain pitch).  Still, I had some support issues.</p><p>So the file shine_on_me_natvib.mp3 is the first complete step.  It is a relatively unedited<br/>recording.  All the parts were moved to center on the correct pitch, but all my unsupported<br/>wavering and vibrato is left in.</p><p>Then I edited to a mild amount of vibrato, did a couple other edits, darkened the timbre by<br/>lowering the formants a little until it sounded as natural as I could get it.  The result is the<br/>normal part tape, the full mix being the Q file.</p><p>Finally, I made a version with NO vibrato, just for comparison.  This one sounds less<br/>natural, but is definitely appealing in a way.</p><p>Overall, I&apos;ve learned especially that &quot;naturalness&quot; of the sound is as or more dependant on<br/>natural levels of vibrato and timbre and tones over the course of notes than on pitch.  I&apos;m<br/>really looking forward to what I&apos;ll find with the Realtime track(s) now.</p><p>Any questions, comments, feedback are welcome.  More to come eventually.</p><p>In Harmony,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2006 12:28:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Wolf wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, the tenor-lead minor 3rd on LIGHT-HOUSE, goes from being the top two notes of &gt; a major chord (as 5:6 ratio) to being the top two notes of a seventh chord (a 6:7 ratio if &gt; tuned as a barbershop seventh).

It is obviously masked by the parallel chromatic descent in another part which is a barbershop clichee. I strongly suspect (but don&apos;t have any way of checking) that the chromatic and teh comma descent always go together.</p><p>And it reminds me of my habit, developed while playing alone, of using little inflections to imply harmonic motion and which has endeared me to so many fellow musicians. (Of course I have no idea whether I did that correctly, but neither have my fellow musicians :O).)</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2006 1:02:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Great work, Aaron!!!</p><p>I took Jim Richards&apos; class at Harmony College, in &apos;96 I<br/>believe.</p><p>Thanks for this version of one of my favorite polecats.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>ambassadorbob &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2006 5:44:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very Cool!</p><p>It was great to get the detailed track info, too!</p><p>I definitely like the novib version.

In other words, I think the simple wavering and<br/>vibrato are enough to have less lock and sound more like a typical<br/>quartet.  I don&apos;t in any way think that&apos;s good though.  And I think<br/>it shows that there&apos;s no reason to doubt that a normal quartet is<br/>still aiming for JI (if they are good enough to know what to aim for<br/>at all).</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2006 9:48:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In other words, I think the simple wavering and<br/>&gt; vibrato are enough to have less lock and sound more like a typical<br/>&gt; quartet.

However I will<br/>observe that maybe locking less often would tend to do that--locking<br/>on long sustained chords especially, and in particular the final chord.</p></div>
