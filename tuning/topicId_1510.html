Maybe one day I will.</p><p>This is a very healthy reminder that not<br/>everyone on the Tuning List is a composer.<br/>Some aren&apos;t even musicians, and that&apos;s fine.<br/>No one ever said this was called the<br/>&quot;Alternatively-Tuned Music List&quot;! It&apos;s<br/>purpose is to discuss tunings, whether or<br/>not they concern actual music.</p><p>I&apos;ll point out again that the ancient<br/>Greeks believed that one had to study and<br/>understand music - and that was mainly<br/>concerning tuning - before he was ready to<br/>tackle logic and philosophy.  It had not<br/>much to do with actual music-making - it<br/>was strictly a mental discipline.</p><p>[Keenan:]<br/>&gt; By the way Monz. Thanks for all the work you<br/>&gt; put into showing those approximations to higher<br/>&gt; harmonics on the smallest reasonable 5 limit<br/>&gt; lattice. Beautiful! And that list of errors and<br/>&gt; matrices. What can I say!</p><p>Thanks, Dave.  I&apos;m glad *somebody* liked it!<br/>I&apos;ve been waiting for a response to that post and<br/>no one seemed interested.</p><p>&gt; I enjoyed it immensely and hope to compose some<br/>&gt; theoretical pieces of my own some day, based on<br/>&gt; some of its themes.</p><p>Good!  That&apos;s the highest compliment I can receive.<br/>The reason I spew so much stuff onto this list<br/>is because I hope to foment (and ferment) new<br/>ideas and theories.</p><p>[Keenan:]<br/>&gt; I hope it will all appear in higher<br/>&gt; resolution and colour on your website soon.</p><p>As soon as I can get back to San Diego!<br/>And as long as Jonathan Glasier keeps the<br/>Sonic Arts website going.</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
