He recommended that I join this list - well, I finally got around to it - and it&apos;s great! I came in on issue 679.</p><p>I have a question about Scala. I&apos;ve recently downloaded the most current version - 1.6. I am able to use it for analysis, but have been unable to get it to recognize my USB midi port, so that I can transmit the midi to my keyboard - which is supported - the venerable TX81Z. Looks like the 2 midi programs included, do not recognize this kind of port. I also tried to get it to create a .MID file to send with my sequencer - Cake Walk 9.0. Couldn&apos;t get it to work either. Do you know if Scala can &quot;Send/File&quot; as a Sysx format? Perhaps this is what the synth would like to have.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Send instant messages with Yahoo!
