Can somebody show a method for finding which tunings will support a<br/>&gt;&gt;given rank-order matrix?  Preferably one that works on both just and<br/>&gt;&gt;equal step scales?</p><p>Paul E. asked...</p><p>&gt;What&apos;s a rank-order matrix?</p><p>I answered...</p><p>&gt;A graphic method of determining propriety, no matter how many unique<br/>&gt;interior intervals a scale has (Chalmers&apos; formula only works for two), is<br/>to &gt;construct its &quot;interval matrix&quot;.  This is just its tonality diamond.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To make a &quot;rank-order matrix&quot;, take this diamond and replace each<br/>interval&apos;s &gt;logarithmic magnitude with an integer ranking its size relative<br/>to all the &gt;other intervals in the diamond.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The idea is that several scales, each having a different interval matrix,<br/>&gt;may all be percieved as re-tunings of eachother if they share the same<br/>rank-&gt;order matrix.</p><p>This first question remains unanswered.  I asked two more...</p><p>&gt;&gt;2. Can a proper scale with one and only one ambiguous interval in each<br/>&gt;&gt;mode exist?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;3. What about a proper scale with one and only one ambiguous interval<br/>&gt;&gt;in each interval (steps) class?</p><p>Paul E. responded...</p><p>&gt;An ambiguity occurs between two intervals, therefore it is hard to know<br/>&gt;what you mean by &quot;one ambiguous interval.&quot;</p><p>I did phrase these last two questions in a confusing way.   Perhaps I<br/>should have asked: Can a proper (but not strictly proper) scale have its<br/>ambiguous interval(s) distributed so that they occur only once in each mode<br/>(question 2) or interval class (question 3)?  Despite my confusion of<br/>terminology, I think my subsequent post did make it clear what I was after...</p><p>&gt;Let&apos;s take a look at its &quot;interval matrix&quot;...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (C)  (D)  (E) (F#) (G#)<br/>&gt;2nds   2    2    2    2   *4<br/>&gt;3rds  *4   *4   *4   *6   *6<br/>&gt;4ths  *6   *6   *8   *8   *8<br/>&gt;5ths  *8   10   10   10   10<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And rank-order matrix...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (C)  (D)  (E) (F#) (G#)<br/>&gt;2nds   1    1    1    1   *2<br/>&gt;3rds  *2   *2   *2   *3   *3<br/>&gt;4ths  *3   *3   *4   *4   *4<br/>&gt;5ths  *4    5    5    5    5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Modes are the columns, interval classes the rows.  Ambiguous intervals are<br/>&gt;marked by stars.  My questions are then:  2. Can a scale exist that has<br/>one &gt;and only one star in each column?  3. Can a scale exist that has one<br/>and &gt;only one star in each row?</p><p>Since I asked them, I have figured answers to these last two questions.<br/>The answer to question 3 is &quot;no&quot;.  If you insist on having at least one<br/>ambiguous interval appearance in each interval class, then the least amount<br/>you can get to appear is 1 in the smallest class, 1 in the largest class,<br/>and 2 in each of the other classes (no matter how many there are).</p><p>The answer to question 2 is &quot;yes&quot;.  Scales can exist that have one and only<br/>one ambiguous interval appearance in each mode.  Take this generic 3 note<br/>scale (rank order matrix)...</p><p>       X    Y    Z<br/>2nds   1    1   *2<br/>3rds  *2   *2    3<br/>4ths   4    4    4</p><p>To see how this might look, let&apos;s tune it in 12tET.  For simplicity let&apos;s<br/>assume that the 4th is the interval of equivalence, and that it is 12 steps<br/>of 12tET, and that the other intervals are scaled proportionally to their<br/>rank.  The interval matrix then looks like this...</p><p>       X    Y    Z<br/>2nds   3    3   *6<br/>3rds  *6   *6    9<br/>4ths  12   12   12</p><p>In standard notation, we can notate this scale like this...</p><p>.C  Eb  F#  C<br/>..^   ^   ^<br/>..3   3   6</p><p>In which case mode &quot;X&quot; starts on C, mode &quot;Y&quot; on Eb, and mode &quot;Z&quot; on F#.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
