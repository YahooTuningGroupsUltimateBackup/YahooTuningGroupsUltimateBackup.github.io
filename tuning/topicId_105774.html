I also outline some of my ideas here that I think are both new and good and deserving of a mention on this group.</p><p>I begin with some of my ideas that relate to just intonation and the construction of just scales which some here may find interesting. I am not a strict just intonation man and my favorite scale is not a just scale but JI is the foundation of my approach. That is, over the last four or more years my method for constructing new tunings has always been to create a just scale first, and then temper (adjust) most of the notes (by not more than +/-6.7758 cents or 256/255) to achieve better melody and/or more good harmony intervals within +/-6.7758 cents accuracy. What follows applies to musical tones with a regular harmonic series (i.e. the frequencies of the partials are very close to x, 2x, 3x, 4x etc. and the intensities of the partials are very close to y, y/2, y/3, y/4 etc.) unless stated otherwise.</p><p>Good Just Harmony Intervals<br/>The following is my method for identifying good (sweet) harmony intervals which I think works better than Harmonic Entropy. Consider a just interval 5/3. The first four harmonics of the 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12 and the first four harmonics of the 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20. (I considered the first 1024 harmonics of both notes in a harmony interval in the program I wrote to quantify the harmony (overall concordance) of a harmony interval but I&apos;m just using four harmonics here to illustrate the method more simply.) I treat each harmonic as a single note so we have 8 notes: 3, 6, 9, 12, 5, 10, 15 and 20. If each of the 8 notes is paired with each of the other seven notes we get 28 distinct pairs of notes (intervals) which could be compared to sine wave intervals as they have no overtones. I think that concordance has to do with periodicity and dissonance has to do with beating. If two sine wave notes (no overtones) correspond to x /y (x&gt;=y) then for me the periodicity (concordance) value is 1/x + 1/y.  Note that x and y should *not* be simplified because of periodicity (e.g. 15/9 could be simplified to 5/3 but should be entered into the formula *without* simplification, as 1/15 + 1/9). The dissonance value is y/x if y/x is less than or equal to 0.9375 (15/16). If y/x is greater than 0.9375 (a very narrow interval) then the dissonance value should be (1 - y/x)*15. So for each of the 28 pairs in this example the concordance and dissonance values are worked out and the overall dissonance (beating) value is subtracted from the overall concordance (periodicity) value. Also the result for each pair must be &grave;weighted&apos; according to the intensity of the weaker harmonic of the two notes in each pair. If the pair is a/b and &grave;a&apos; is a 2nd harmonic and &grave;b&apos; is a 4th harmonic then the &grave;b&apos; is the weakest (quietest) note in the pair and the result (concordance - dissonance) should be divided by the number of the weaker harmonic (in this case 4). This idea is similar to the idea of a chain being only as strong as its weakest link. When the values for all 28 pairs are added together a constant value &grave;z&apos; should be added to the result but I haven&apos;t worked out what z is yet (this is explained in detail in my latest book). Regardless of whether or not I know what z is I can certainly arrange intervals in decreasing order of concordance and by listening I can choose a cut off point above which I deem harmony intervals to be good and below which harmony intervals should be bad. Here are the harmony intervals I consider to be good over a one octave range. The number in the middle is the width of the interval in cents and the number on the right is the relative strength value of the interval, relative to a zero point I chose in a listening test.</p><p> 1/1      0.0   93.83<br/> 9/8    203.9    0.92<br/> 8/7    231.2    2.61<br/> 7/6    266.9    4.80<br/> 6/5    315.6    7.81<br/> 5/4    386.3   12.12<br/> 9/7    435.1    2.12<br/> 4/3    498.0   19.11<br/>11/8    551.3    0.20<br/> 7/5    582.5    6.66<br/>10/7    617.5    1.58<br/> 3/2    702.0   32.23<br/>11/7    782.5    1.20<br/> 8/5    813.7    5.81<br/> 5/3    884.4   16.67<br/>12/7    933.1    0.87<br/> 7/4    968.8    9.43<br/> 9/5   1017.6    5.20<br/>11/6   1049.4    2.42<br/>13/7   1071.7    0.43<br/> 2/1   1200.0   67.21</p><p>All of these intervals occur at least once per octave in my Raven Temperament tuning within +/-6.7758 cents (256/255) accuracy. 6.7758 cents is my maximum deviation (when tempering) from a just interval. I have a list of 90 good, just harmony intervals between 1/1 and 24/1 inclusive which I think is exhaustive and complete. For me if an interval is expressed as x/y and if x and/or y is greater than 24 then the interval is not good (both in melody and in harmony) in a &quot;just&quot; sense. The 32/1 (five octaves) interval, in harmony, does not sound dissonant to my ears, but it does sound weak, too weak for me, so I rule it out. So for me the widest legal just interval, in melody or in harmony is 24/1.</p><p>Note that there are some just harmony intervals that I give a strength value greater than zero (similar to the list above) but they contain a number higher than 24. For me these intervals are not dissonant but rather they are weak, too weak for me (e.g. 32/1) so I won&apos;t use them.</p><p>Good (24 Limit) Just Melodic Intervals<br/>It seems to me that the strength value of a just melodic interval, x/y, is 1/x + 1/y (I use 2/x + 2/y in my book for reasons explained in the book but this does not affect the strength order of the intervals). Also I think that if x and/or y is greater than 24 then the interval is not good.</p><p>What about 29/27? This sounds acceptable in melody but contains a 29 (greater than 24). It turns out that  29/27 is within 4.3 cents of 15/14. So in the context of 24 limit JI I would not consider 29/27 to be a good &quot;just&quot; interval but it is very close to a good just interval, close to 15/14 and close enough to be acceptable if you&apos;re not strict.</p><p>My understanding of convention is that any interval x/y can be called &quot;just&quot; if both x and y are integers regardless of the size of x or y (e.g. 1024/1023 is a just interval). I make a further distinction, that if an interval, in melody, x/y, is just *and* x and y are both less than 25 then the interval is not only just but also &quot;24 Limit Just&quot; and therefore, for me, good. So in melody there are exactly 180 different &quot;24 Limit Just&quot; intervals where x and y are less than 25. I have found that in harmony (if I&apos;m right) there are exactly 90 &quot;24 Limit Just&quot; harmony intervals (listed in the book).</p><p>Some think that melodically anything goes. I disagree. I think that a good example of a melodic interval that I consider to be too weak or sour is 721 cents. 721 cents is 19 cents above 3/2 and is 19 cents below the next &quot;24 Limit Just&quot; melodic interval, 23/15. Try it yourself.</p><p>37 cents is another good example of a sour melodic interval. 37 cents is half way between 256/255 (a tempered unison) and 24/23 (the narrowest, apart from a unison, legal melodic 24 Limit Just interval) tempered by minus 6.7758 cents.</p><p>Constructing Just Tunings<br/>Consider this just tuning (my own Blue Just Tuning)...<br/>1/1, 15/14, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8, 2/1. It looks and sounds pretty good but it has one huge flaw: it contains melodic just intervals x/y where x and or y is greater than 24 which for me are illegal. For example pair 5/3 with 9/8 and you get 40/27 (680.4 cents). 680.4 cents is more 17 cents away from the nearest 24 Limit Just interval: 22/15 (663.0 cents).</p><p>It seems to me that it is impossible to create a 24 Limit Just tuning that has more than seven or eight notes per octave where all the notes relate to each other according to a 24 Limit Just interval (at least over a one octave range between 1/1 and 2/1). Here&apos;s the best that I could do...</p><p>I started with 1/1, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 2/1 because 4/3, 3/2, 5/3 and 2/1 are very strong melodically when paired with 1/1. Next I looked for the strongest (when paired with 1/1) just note that goes with all the other notes according to 24 Limit Just intervals and I got 5/4. Then 7/4 and finally 7/6. So the scale I got  (called Raven JI) was:</p><p>1/1, 7/6, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4, 2/1.</p><p>Any note here, paired with any other note (over the one octave range) produces a 24 Limit Just interval.</p><p>You cannot add another just note to this scale without introducing an interval that is not 24 Limit (i.e. contains a 25 or higher) which would be illegal for me. The implication here is that if the 24 Limit idea is correct then it is impossible to build 24 limit just scales that have more than 7 or 8 notes per octave where all the melodic intervals (at least over a one octave range, between 1/1 and 2/1 inclusive) are 24 Limit Just intervals. In other words if there is a just tuning you like that has more than 7 or 8 notes per octave then it will have to contain at least one just melodic interval that is not 24 Limit and therefore (for me anyway) the just tuning must be illegal.</p><p>There are a few compositions in Raven JI by Chris Vaisvil on my web site...</p><p><a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">http://www.johnsmusic7.com</a></p><p>The compositions do not sound extra special or spectacular (with regard to my tuning and not Chris&apos; playing) but mathematically (at least over a one octave range and melodically) they should be pure, according to my current understanding.</p><p>Below is a list of just chords in Raven JI where the tonic (1/1) is assigned the key of D. The root note of each chord is often *not* the lowest note. I have a method for identifying the root note of a chord which is outlined in the book.</p><p>D     0.0 cents   1/1<br/>E   266.9 cents   7/6<br/>F   386.3 cents   5/4<br/>G   498.0 cents   4/3<br/>A   702.0 cents   3/2<br/>B   884.4 cents   5/3<br/>C   968.8 cents   7/4<br/>D  1200.0 cents   2/1</p><p>The tonic is D. The chords listed below, and any subset of a chord listed should all be good. The root note of each chord is often not the lowest note in the chord.</p><p>D,A,D,F,A,C,D       2:3:4:5:6:7:8<br/>D,G,B,D,E,G,A,D     3:4:5:6:7:8:9:12<br/>D,G,B,D,E,G,B,D     3:4:5:6:7:8:10:12<br/>D,F,A,C,D,F,A,C,D   4:5:6:7:8:10:12:14:16<br/>D,E,G,A,D           6:7:8:9:12<br/>D,E,G,B,D,E,G       6:7:8:10:12:14:16<br/>D,G,A,D,A,D         6:8:9:12:18:24<br/>D,B,D,F,A,D         6:10:12:15:18:24<br/>D,B,D,F,B,D         6:10:12:15:20:24</p><p>E,C,E,C,E           2:3:4:6:8<br/>E,G,A,D             7:8:9:12<br/>E,G,B,D,E,G         7:8:10:12:14:16<br/>E,A,D,C             7:9:12:21<br/>E,D,E,C             7:12:14:21</p><p>F,B,F,B,F           3:4:6:8:12<br/>F,A,C,D,F,A,C,D     5:6:7:8:10:12:14:16<br/>F,A,D,F,A,C,D,F     5:6:8:10:12:14:16:20</p><p>G,D,G,B,D,E,G       2:3:4:5:6:7:8<br/>G,B,D,E,G,A,D       4:5:6:7:8:9:12<br/>G,B,D,E,G,B,D,E,G   4:5:6:7:8:10:12:14:16<br/>G,B,D,A,D,F         4:5:6:9:12:15<br/>G,B,D,B,D,F         4:5:6:10:12:15<br/>G,A,D,A,D           8:9:12:18:24</p><p>A,D,F,A,C,D,F,A     3:4:5:6:7:8:10:12<br/>A,C,D,F,A,C,D       6:7:8:10:12:14:16</p><p>B,F,B,F,B           2:3:4:6:8<br/>B,D,E,G,A,D         5:6:7:8:9:12<br/>B,D,E,G,B,D,E,G     5:6:7:8:10:12:14:16<br/>B,D,G,B,D,E,G,A     5:6:8:10:12:14:16:18<br/>B,D,G,B,D,E,G,B     5:6:8:10:12:14:16:20<br/>B,D,A,D,F,A         5:6:9:12:15:18<br/>B,D,B,D,F,A         5:6:10:12:15:18<br/>B,D,B,D,F,B         5:6:10:12:15:20</p><p>C,E,C,E,C           3:4:6:8:12<br/>C,D,F,A,C,D         7:8:10:12:14:16</p><p>Why I don&apos;t use generators or commas...</p><p>I don&apos;t know what a val or a monzo or a wedgie is but I know a little bit about commas and generators and I explain here why I don&apos;t use them. I&apos;m not saying there&apos;s anything wrong with using commas and generators and they certainly &quot;work&quot; but I don&apos;t think using them is the best or only way to do it. I think my way, outlined below, is better.</p><p>For me the melodic aspect of a tuning is much more important than the harmony (chords) aspect. It&apos;s no good having a lot of great chords if you can&apos;t make a decent chord progression or melody.</p><p>My favourite 12TET scale is the pentatonic minor. If you play in E then the notes are E, G, A, B, D, E. When I improvise using this scale and when I play G or A or B or D I feel like I&apos;m going somewhere. When I play an E I feel like I&apos;ve arrived. It&apos;s the same with the white keys on a piano, the C key will always sound the most resolved. So for me the tonics of a scale (1/1 and 2/1) are much more important than the notes in between. I want a scale where the notes are as strong as possible when paired melodically with both 1/1 and 2/1 (with 1/1 being more important than 2/1 because 1 is smaller than 2).</p><p>The only advantage I can see to using chains of intervals is the ability to modulate. It seems to me that using a chain of generators the notes in the chain closest to the starting note can also be used as tonics. If the starting note is called 0 (zero) then the 6 notes in the chain going down from and up from 0 could be written as -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p><p>My understanding is that 0 is the best choice as tonic but you could use -1 or +1 as a tonic as well. In other words you can modulate, change from one key to another. I never liked key changes in music and if I want to play a microtonal scale in a different key then I just retune my midi keyboard accordingly. With a microtonal guitar I&apos;m sure it&apos;s feasible to build a pedal that will tune up or down the notes played so as to conform with a certain chosen key.</p><p>I have a list of notes that go well melodically with 1/1 and 2/1. So when I build a scale I can find exactly what notes I want without having to fool around with generators and commas. For example I start with 1/1 and 2/1 and select notes in between. 2/1 is the strongest note melodically (apart from a unison) when paired with 1/1. Melodically 4/3 and 3/2 are very strong when paired with both 1/1 and 2/1 and I wouldn&apos;t touch a scale that has no fourth (4/3), fifth (3/2) or octave (2/1) within +/-6.7758 cents accuracy. Also, for me 5/3 makes a major melodic interval when paired with 1/1 and 6/5 makes a major melodic interval when paired with 2/1. For the last year or two all the scales I worked on began with 1/1, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 2/1 (tempered later) and at this point I don&apos;t think I would ever use a tuning that did not contain these six notes within +/-6.7758 cents (256/255) accuracy.</p><p>I made a comprehensive list of seventy, 24 limit, just (when paired melodically with both 1/1 and 2/1) notes and when I build a new tuning I choose notes from this list that are strong when paired melodically with both 1/1 and 2/1. The notes I choose depend on what I want. My Raven Temperament tuning contains *all* of the harmony intervals an octave or less wide (listed above and within +/-6.7758 cents accuracy) and the notes were chosen to achieve this. Another tuning does not have *all* the harmony intervals listed but it might have more good harmony intervals overall (even though some of the good harmony intervals in my list do not occur).</p><p>I always temper these just scales to maximize the number of good harmony intervals (within 6.7758 cents or 256/255) and to avoid bad melodic intervals (e.g. 721 cents and 37 cents).</p><p>I could go on at length but I&apos;ve said enough for now. Here&apos;s a challenge for the experts in the group. I set out to build a scale that has these three properties...</p><p>1. *All* of the 21 intervals in my list of good harmony intervals above must occur at least once per octave within +/-6.7758 cents of just.</p><p>2. The scale contains a 4/3 (IV) and a 3/2 (V) within +/-6.7758 cents accuracy and if a major chord is defined as 2:3:4:5:6:8 then all the intervals in the I (1/1) Major, IV (4/3) Major and V (3/2) Major chords are good within +/-6.7758 cents accuracy.</p><p>3. No sour melodic notes (at least between 1/1 and 2/1 occur.</p><p>Here are the ranges that I think are sour melodically (e.g. any melodic interval between 6.7759 and 66.9048 inclusive should be illegal)</p><p>   6.7759 -   66.9048<br/> 223.4626 -  224.3982<br/> 273.6468 -  274.5824<br/> 304.2889 -  308.8654<br/> 322.4172 -  323.9854<br/> 372.6013 -  379.5378<br/> 393.0896 -  397.6661<br/> 477.5568 -  491.2691<br/> 504.8209 -  516.5430<br/> 543.7267 -  544.5420<br/> 570.1582 -  575.7363<br/> 589.2881 -  590.2237<br/> 609.7763 -  610.7119<br/> 669.8251 -  695.1791<br/> 708.7309 -  733.2297<br/> 771.6918 -  775.7161<br/> 802.3339 -  806.9104<br/> 820.4622 -  823.4774<br/> 866.2243 -  877.5828<br/> 891.1346 -  904.0144<br/> 925.4176 -  926.3532<br/> 952.9710 -  962.0500<br/> 975.6018 -  980.9708<br/>1002.8659 - 1010.8204<br/>1024.3722 - 1028.2199<br/>1041.7717 - 1042.5870<br/>1078.4777 - 1081.4928<br/>1133.0952 - 1193.2241</p><p>I identified all of the 24 limit just melodic intervals an octave or less wide and then calculated the ranges that are not within 6.7728 cents of any interval in the list.</p><p>The scale I worked out has these three properties and is called Raven Temperament (version 2).</p><p>The challenge is can anyone here build a scale with 12 notes per octave that has all three properties listed above using chains of generators?

They&apos;re all<br/>useful and consonant and all that good stuff. Above all, John, you should<br/>do what you like. However, I was struck by this line in your latest missive.</p><p>I&apos;ve pretty much proved to myself that this isn&apos;t the case. The trivial<br/>case is audible when I&apos;m playing in Am. C simply doesn&apos;t sound the most<br/>resolved when I&apos;m playing in Am. That leads me to believe that what sounds<br/>most resolved will depend on what notes you emphasize, what orders you play<br/>them in, etc.</p><p>I&apos;m a noodler, so I took that idea a while back and tried to take it as far<br/>as I could in 12 EDO (which would control for any xenharmonic weirdness of<br/>other tunings). I started noodling around in B Locrian on my piano (i.e.,<br/>all of the white keys, but starting on B). There&apos;s no doubt that a final B<br/>note can sound more resolved than a final C note.</p><p>Here&apos;s one way I make it happen.</p><p>* I start by droning a bit with the left hand on a low B, maybe playing a<br/>B-D dyad. Then in the right hand I play melodies that start on B, that<br/>emphasize D, and that mostly (but not completely) avoid F. I don&apos;t<br/>necessarily avoid C, although it tends to be part of little ornaments like<br/>B-C-B-A-B. I&apos;m essentially playing a melody over a Bm with an<br/>only-occasionally-sounded b5.</p><p>* After I&apos;ve gotten that sound in my ear, I progress down a major third to<br/>G major (which feels *really* good, but not more &quot;resolved&quot; -- I haven&apos;t<br/>lost the fact that I&apos;m in a mode of B), down a second to F major (usually<br/>emphasizing the sharp 4th), back up a second to G, and then back to B.</p><p>* I do that for a few minutes, spending probably as much time on Bmb5 as I<br/>do on the combination of F and G. Melodies in the right hand continue<br/>throughout.</p><p>* Then, while in the B-based section, I start doing downward runs in the<br/>right hand. A high B to B an octave below sounds perfectly resolved, even<br/>with the flat fifth. But then I boost it one note, and start making runs<br/>from C to C an octave below using the same timing -- and the C *forces* me<br/>to play the B. Forces. I mean, the run simply isn&apos;t resolved unless I drop<br/>a half-step to B.</p><p>* And, lest you think it sounds that way because I&apos;m playing a B in the<br/>left hand rather than a C: I sometimes move my left hand up to a C at the<br/>beginning of the C-to-C run. For the first tens of seconds it most<br/>certainly does not sound resolved, but rather like I&apos;ve made a great leap<br/>to a different key. (If I play in C long enough, moving back to B will<br/>sound funny in the same way, of course.) In the same way, if I use my B<br/>drone while playing a C to C run, and then play a C major chord only when I<br/>land on the final C -- well, it sounds like aliens have landed. It doesn&apos;t<br/>even really sound &quot;major&quot;.</p><p>I keep thinking I should record or render something like this so people can<br/>hear what it sounds like. It&apos;s really remarkable.</p><p>Perhaps, John, you&apos;re too absolutist when it comes to saying that<br/>&quot;such-and-such a note sounds most resolved&quot;. I tend to distrust those kinds<br/>of comments because they don&apos;t fit my experience. A given note may sound<br/>more or less resolved in a different context, and given your tendency to<br/>isolate individual dyads in listening tests, you may not be able to account<br/>for that in the way you create scales.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=105784 href="#105784">ðŸ”—</a>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2013 12:47:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot;  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1/1, 7/6, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4, 2/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any note here, paired with any other note (over the one octave<br/>&gt; &gt; range) produces a 24 Limit Just interval.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ah!

None of these are really deal-breakers, and you can&apos;t use them<br/>to say anything is &quot;wrong&quot; with your elf scales. It just depends on<br/>what you want. There are plenty of MOS&apos;s which are improper too, and I<br/>don&apos;t use them in the same way that I&apos;d use, for instance,<br/>porcupine[7]; I typically treat them more like auxiliary scales which<br/>can be used to create a certain effect. I can see your scale being<br/>very useful in that sense, but I think I&apos;d be more likely to play with<br/>keenanismic Fokker blocks as my main center, modulating with them as I<br/>want, and then I&apos;d jump to this elf every so often to capture this<br/>specific sound whenever I want.</p><p>Here&apos;s another question: would C D Eb F Gb Ab A B C be a<br/>meantone/8-EDO elf?

They&apos;re all<br/>&gt; useful and consonant and all that good stuff. Above all, John, you should<br/>&gt; do what you like. However, I was struck by this line in your latest missive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve pretty much proved to myself that this isn&apos;t the case. The trivial<br/>&gt; case is audible when I&apos;m playing in Am. C simply doesn&apos;t sound the most<br/>&gt; resolved when I&apos;m playing in Am.</p><p>If Major is defined as strong and happy and Minor is weaker or sad then by definition the C major scale should be stronger/happier than the A minor scale. Sure, over a one octave range between A and the next A then using *only* these eight white keys the bottom and top A keys will sound the most resolved and the C key in between won&apos;t. However over a greater range (e.g. three or more octaves using only white keys) it seems to me that the C keys are the most resolved sounding. I should also say that I don&apos;t think that using A as the tonic when playing white keys only should be illegal, I just think it&apos;s inferior to C. Thanks for positive comments on my scales.</p><p>John.</p><p>That leads me to believe that what sounds<br/>&gt; most resolved will depend on what notes you emphasize, what orders you play<br/>&gt; them in, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a noodler, so I took that idea a while back and tried to take it as far<br/>&gt; as I could in 12 EDO (which would control for any xenharmonic weirdness of<br/>&gt; other tunings). I started noodling around in B Locrian on my piano (i.e.,<br/>&gt; all of the white keys, but starting on B). There&apos;s no doubt that a final B<br/>&gt; note can sound more resolved than a final C note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s one way I make it happen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * I start by droning a bit with the left hand on a low B, maybe playing a<br/>&gt; B-D dyad. Then in the right hand I play melodies that start on B, that<br/>&gt; emphasize D, and that mostly (but not completely) avoid F. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; necessarily avoid C, although it tends to be part of little ornaments like<br/>&gt; B-C-B-A-B. I&apos;m essentially playing a melody over a Bm with an<br/>&gt; only-occasionally-sounded b5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * After I&apos;ve gotten that sound in my ear, I progress down a major third to<br/>&gt; G major (which feels *really* good, but not more &quot;resolved&quot; -- I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; lost the fact that I&apos;m in a mode of B), down a second to F major (usually<br/>&gt; emphasizing the sharp 4th), back up a second to G, and then back to B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * I do that for a few minutes, spending probably as much time on Bmb5 as I<br/>&gt; do on the combination of F and G. Melodies in the right hand continue<br/>&gt; throughout.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Then, while in the B-based section, I start doing downward runs in the<br/>&gt; right hand. A high B to B an octave below sounds perfectly resolved, even<br/>&gt; with the flat fifth. But then I boost it one note, and start making runs<br/>&gt; from C to C an octave below using the same timing -- and the C *forces* me<br/>&gt; to play the B. Forces. I mean, the run simply isn&apos;t resolved unless I drop<br/>&gt; a half-step to B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * And, lest you think it sounds that way because I&apos;m playing a B in the<br/>&gt; left hand rather than a C: I sometimes move my left hand up to a C at the<br/>&gt; beginning of the C-to-C run. For the first tens of seconds it most<br/>&gt; certainly does not sound resolved, but rather like I&apos;ve made a great leap<br/>&gt; to a different key. (If I play in C long enough, moving back to B will<br/>&gt; sound funny in the same way, of course.) In the same way, if I use my B<br/>&gt; drone while playing a C to C run, and then play a C major chord only when I<br/>&gt; land on the final C -- well, it sounds like aliens have landed. It doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; even really sound &quot;major&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I keep thinking I should record or render something like this so people can<br/>&gt; hear what it sounds like. It&apos;s really remarkable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps, John, you&apos;re too absolutist when it comes to saying that<br/>&gt; &quot;such-and-such a note sounds most resolved&quot;. I tend to distrust those kinds<br/>&gt; of comments because they don&apos;t fit my experience. A given note may sound<br/>&gt; more or less resolved in a different context, and given your tendency to<br/>&gt; isolate individual dyads in listening tests, you may not be able to account<br/>&gt; for that in the way you create scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Jake<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=105800 href="#105800">ðŸ”—</a>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2013 10:51:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Gene</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot;  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot;  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;For me if an interval is expressed as x/y and if x and/or y is greater than 24 then the interval is not good (both in melody and in harmony) in a &quot;just&quot; sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This terminology is going to confuse people, as there are already two other usages of &quot;limit&quot; which conflict with it--prime limit and odd limit.

Since the 15/8 all but disappears for a while<br/>when this happens, my brain pretty much doesn&apos;t even hear it as being<br/>there anymore; this makes the 8/7 sound like a type of step, or a type<br/>of &quot;second&quot; or whatever, rather than a type of &quot;third&quot; where it passes<br/>over a note.</p><p>So you get the following scale</p><p>1/1 11/10 7/6 11/8 3/2 8/5 7/4 2/1</p><p>then sometimes he throws the 7/4 away and puts 15/8 back, yielding</p><p>1/1 11/10 7/6 11/8 3/2 8/5 15/8 2/1</p><p>these are both epimorphic under &lt;7 11 16 20 24|.</p><p>So I find it interesting that Andrew deliberately threw that 9/7 away,<br/>and then treated the 7/4 and 15/8 in such a way as to obtain these<br/>scales which are clearly perceptually organized by &lt;7 11 16 20 24|<br/>into generic interval classes.
