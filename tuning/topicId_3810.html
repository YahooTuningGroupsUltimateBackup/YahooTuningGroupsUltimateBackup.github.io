Aside from my<br/>paper, the most recently discussed example was 7-out-of-24, where the<br/>maximally even scale, which has three modes with two identical tetrachords,<br/>is far less common than the usual Arabic scale, which has five modes with<br/>two identical tetrachords. Identical tetrachords are a way of providing the<br/>scale with the capacity for near-equivalence at ratios of 3, the same way<br/>you automatically assumed they have the capacity for equivalence at ratios<br/>of 2. This near-equivalence is a cognitively powerful feature; evidence for<br/>its importance is the fact that untrained singers are often off by a ratio<br/>of 3. The break in the near-equivalence (in the usual diatonic scale, the<br/>tritone) provides a unique structural characteristic that allows a sense of<br/>tonaily to be established, while many maximally even scales lack this unique<br/>structural feature.</p></div><h3>D.
