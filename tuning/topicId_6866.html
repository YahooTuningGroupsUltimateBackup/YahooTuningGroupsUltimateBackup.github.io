Encapsulated,<br/>from Austin&apos;s unfortunately far-reaching MUSIC IN THE 20TH CENTURY, Austin<br/>stated &quot;In short, his [Ives] command of musical materials is deficient...&quot;</p><p>A few other lovely quotes from this tome are in order:</p><p>&quot;By 1910 he [Ives] was so thoroughly committed to such rash adventures that<br/>everyone who knew him except his wife, Harmony Twitchell, considered him a<br/>crank...&quot;</p><p>&quot;In 1923 he composed three quarter-tone pieces for two pianos.  Soon<br/>thereafter illness stopped his composing...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thus he often arranged for two or more melodies to conflict in utterly<br/>unorthodox ways, creating polyharmonies and polyrhythms that simply had no<br/>unity short of the unity of the cosmos...&quot;  [Ives&apos; Universe Symphony<br/>aficionados here please take note -- Ed. :-) ]</p><p>&quot;His own melodies are not memorable.  His own rhythms are often sluggish,<br/>or jerky.  His chords are mostly opaque blocks of six or more notes tightly<br/>spaced and doubled in octaves...&quot;  [And now, they will be &quot;out of tune,&quot;<br/>too -- ed. note :-)  ]</p><p>&quot;He is unconcerned about performers&apos; ease or gratification.
