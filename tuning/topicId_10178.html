Schulter&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, and I&apos;d agree that a 61-note keyboard (four octaves in a<br/>&gt; conventional mapping with 12-note octaves of one sort or another) is a<br/>&gt; widely recommended minimum standard. As a TX802 user specializing in<br/>&gt; medieval and Renaissance music, I may be &quot;the exception that proves the<br/>&gt; rule,&quot; as I&apos;ll shortly discuss.</p><p>While correcting errors in one&apos;s own posts on a public forum is often a<br/>luxury whose omission can save bandwidth as well as a bit of<br/>embarrassment, in this case I feel it important my slip of the keyboard<br/>stating that a standard 61-note keyboard (MIDI or otherwise) has _four_<br/>octaves, when of course it has _five_.</p><p>My concern here is that an unwary reader could conceivably take my slip as<br/>accurate information, and conclude that the widely accepted minimum<br/>standard for a keyboard of at least 61 notes means a model with four<br/>octaves, when of course the standard means &quot;at least five.&quot;</p><p>Very likely my slip was in a way Freudian: I must have been focusing on my<br/>own unusual configuration with two four-octave keyboards (49 notes each,<br/>not 61) -- quite ample, if you regard the music of Monteverdi or<br/>Frescobaldi from the era around 1600 as &quot;ultra-modern.&quot; By the time of<br/>Bach, a 61-note keyboard was becoming more common -- which means five<br/>octaves, as opposed to my Renaissance standard of four.</p><p>More generally, for a usual layout with 12-note octaves, the formula for<br/>the number of keys on a keyboard with n octaves would be</p><p>12n + 1</p><p>This is true because on modern keyboards with we typically have all 12<br/>keys for a chromatic scale (however tuned or tempered, electronically or<br/>otherwise) in each octave, plus an extra note at the top doubling the<br/>lowest note of the instrument at some octave.</p><p>Thus a four-octave keyboard would have four octaves of 12 notes each,<br/>e.g. C2-B2, C3-B3, C4-B4, C5-B5 (in this MIDI notation C4 is middle C),<br/>plus the high note C6 (four octaves above the lowest note C2). In a more<br/>traditional notation, we have the octaves C-B, c-b, c&apos;-b&apos;, and c&apos;&apos;-b&apos;&apos;,<br/>plus the high note c&apos;&apos;&apos;. Thus we have (12 x 4) + 1 or 49 notes in all.</p><p>Likewise one possible range for a 61-note keyboard, the usual minimum<br/>recommendation for MIDI, would be C2-C7 or C-c&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;, with five octaves of<br/>12 notes each (C2-B2, C3-B3, C4-B4, C5-B5, and C6-B6) plus a high note C7.<br/>Here we have (12 x 5) + 1 or 61 notes in all.</p><p>Thus the minimum recommended keyboard (medievalists like myself aside, for<br/>whom a &quot;full four octaves&quot; may elicit a certain &quot;Wow!&quot;) has 61 keys and<br/>five octaves. Incidentally, I recall reading this recommendation on<br/>minimum keyboard range in a book on MIDI published in the late 1980&apos;s or<br/>so; five octaves or more has apparently been an accepted guideline for<br/>quite a while.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@shell1.tiac.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2000 11:41:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 24 May 2000, M.
