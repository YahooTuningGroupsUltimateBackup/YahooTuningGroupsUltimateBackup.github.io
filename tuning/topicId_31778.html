Clearly, there is some very special difference between<br/>&gt; &gt; 3-limit and 5-limit ratios, more than simply the size of the numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or look at meter. 3 and 2, and their &quot;octave equivalents, 4, 6, 8 (and<br/>&gt; to a lesser extent 9 and 12) dominate musics which have a metric<br/>&gt; orientation. The more comlicated prime rhythm musics (Balkan and Indian<br/>&gt; musics) tend to heirarchically arrive at those primes by summing 2&apos;s, 3&apos;s<br/>&gt; and 4&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Its not just that small numbers are &quot;good&quot;, but very small numbers are<br/>&gt; &quot;good&quot;. As has been pointed out, due to the definition of prime numbers,<br/>&gt; the population of primes is more dense in the population of small<br/>&gt; numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine</p><p>J Gill: It also seems that -</p><p>The business of any differences arising out of the &quot;in-divisibility&quot; or<br/>&quot;divisibility&quot; of a number (this being the difference between primes and their<br/>multiples) still seems murky (despite the valid &quot;octave-equivalence&quot; which has<br/>been applied by some).What about pitch multiplications/divisions of the numbers<br/>3, 5, and 7?</p><p>And what do you think of a concept of &quot;rooted-ness&quot; occuring where powers of the<br/>prime 2 appear in the numerator or the denominator (which, if I have interpreted<br/>Dave Keenan correctly, may impart a character unique due to &quot;octave-equivalence&quot;<br/>effects)?</p><p>(1) IF it is true that it *is* the integers &quot;smallness&quot; (and not its &quot;prime<br/>status&quot;) which is the cogent characteristic giving rise (at least in part) to a<br/>sort of &quot;recognizability&quot; (and thus, perhaps, distinct tonal &quot;personality&quot;) in<br/>certain (but likely not *all*) contexts (primarily related, then, to a small<br/>numerical vaue, as opposed to whether the value is either divisible or<br/>in-divisible); AND</p><p>(2) IF it is true that listeners (perhaps even untrained ones, to a certian<br/>extent) are, upon hearing &quot;complex&quot; tones sounded in unison with a &quot;complex&quot;<br/>tone at 1/1, are able to &quot;recognize and categorize&quot; various levels of the<br/>pitch-heights of the secondary &quot;complex&quot; tone of such a &quot;complex&quot; dyad; AND</p><p>(3) BEATS (whether they be perceived as benefical, beautiful, or maddening, or<br/>familiar - as Paul Erlich pointed out in relation to the &quot;beats&quot; created by<br/>12-tone ET which are a familiar and *desired* spectral characteristic &quot;absent&quot;<br/>in JI tunings), being a (necessary) blessing/curse in any practical system; AND</p><p>(4) We think of, speak of, and appear to (in some cases) &quot;aurally perceive&quot;<br/>various possible combinations of such &quot;complex&quot; tones formed into dyads [dyads<br/>as described above [in (2)] as representing a (simultaneously sounded, or<br/>&quot;harmonious&quot;) tonal &quot;affinity&quot; of sorts, etc; THEN</p><p>(5) WHY(?) would one tend to minimize the fact that:</p><p>The *lower* in value of the size of the number, the lower the harmonic number<br/>(of a 1/1 reference pitch) at which the *first* &quot;harmonic coincidence&quot; takes<br/>place, and (correspondingly) the *more* &quot;harmonic coincidences&quot; *occur* (per<br/>unit bandwidth) throughout the resulting frequency spectrum...</p><p>Thus it would (to me) seem that - while this (historically widely discussed)<br/>phenomena may well *not*, in itself, &quot;sum-up&quot; perceptual metaphors such as<br/>&quot;consonance&quot;, or &quot;con-cordance&quot;, or &quot;affinity&quot;, etc, is it not (at least, one<br/>of) the most tangible and widely applicable (to multiple tones, in addition to<br/>dyads) descriptor of &quot;physically&quot; (as opposed to &quot;psychically&quot;) describable and<br/>characterizable tonal inter-relationships between members of groups of &quot;complex&quot;<br/>(fundamental plus harmonic content possible) tones in unison.</p><p>Curiously, J Gill</p></div>
