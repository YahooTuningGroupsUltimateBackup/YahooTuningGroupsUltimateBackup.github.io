I want to hear now from the real Brett Barbaro:<br/>&gt;does he prefer mean-tone or adaptive JI?</p><p>The real Brett knows very little about tuning but was not happy with the<br/>inability to play Ab chords on my piano (tuned in meantone), despite the<br/>fact that he immediately noticed and liked the sound of the purer chords.<br/>However, the piano is still in meantone, though the tuning is deteriorating<br/>(due in part to Brett&apos;s daily, aggressive playing). I think some version of<br/>the Lumma/Keenan tuning will be next.</p><p>Brett is into techno music and so likes the sound of the overtone series<br/>(familiar to him from all the analog-synth-style filter sweeps). He may<br/>reprogram his Roland Groovebox to a 12-tone JI for future Mad Duxx projects,<br/>if he ever gets around to it.</p><p>As for me, I think the ideal tuning for diatonic triadic music would be a<br/>compromise between adaptive JI and meantone, closer to adaptive JI (but not<br/>one based on 12-tET). I would take all the &quot;pains&quot; you listed and add the<br/>&quot;pain&quot; of not having simultaneities in JI, which would have to be balanced<br/>against all the other pains. In addition, I think truly exact JI is painful<br/>due to potential frequency cancellations, but that&apos;s rarely a concern with<br/>current equipment (which rarely achieves truly exact JI anyway).</p></div>
