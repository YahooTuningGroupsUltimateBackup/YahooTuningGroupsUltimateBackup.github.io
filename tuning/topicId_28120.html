That<br/>suggests 64/63 could be a unison vector misinterpreted as a<br/>step.</p><p>Besides you wrote precedently:</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>   Personally, I think Blackjack, let along Canasta, have<br/>   too many notes to be heard and conceptualized in their<br/>   entirety, the way diatonic scales and their Middle-Eastern<br/>   cousins are, and perhaps my decatonic scales can be.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>So rather than comment on receivability in gammier theory of<br/>your detempered values, I would suggest a reinterpretation<br/>of the Blackjack set using incidentally a decatonic gammier.</p><p>You have to judge if it has interest from musical viewpoint<br/>or even may concern your decatonic scales. If not, it won&apos;t be<br/>bad for it&apos;s not strictly derived from gammier theory. I had<br/>to use ad hoc maths to insert anew consistency into a reduced<br/>(so desorganized) set of 21 intervals out of a gammier having<br/>41 intervals originally.</p><p>-----</p><p>As alternative to the Blackjack set seen as the scale 0 2<br/>7 9 14 16 21 23 28 30 35 37 42 44 49 51 56 58 63 65 70 72<br/>having alternatively steps 2 and 5, let us work on this<br/>approach where the same set would be seen as</p><p>      9  16  23  30  37  44  51  58  65<br/>   0                                     72<br/>      7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63</p><p>where 2 and 70 are missing for being considered as unison<br/>vectors. The values 2 and 70 would keep sense only for the<br/>transposition and would be stranger in the modes begining<br/>with 0.</p><p>-----</p><p>In appearance, there is no problem to describe the melodic<br/>relations here since the steps seem to be simply 7 and 9.<br/>&gt;From the tempered viewpoint it would be hard to go over<br/>the following solution.</p><p>    9---16---23---30---37---44---51---58---65<br/>   /   /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /  \<br/>  0   /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /    72<br/>   \ /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /    /<br/>    7---14---21---28---35---42---49---56---63</p><p>However, I recall that the Blackjack set is supposed to<br/>be very closed from just values in 11-limit and it&apos;s a<br/>reduced set (after Canasta 31 and Miracle 41), so the<br/>steps are not forcely all retained.</p><p>So I want to refine the problem seeking to detemper in<br/>such way that the intervals would be both of minimal<br/>sonance and melodically well-organized.</p><p>-----</p><p>I have a link to images (post 1000) showing that the gammier<br/>ib1215 would be the simplest solution using 41 intervals and<br/>where it is easy to see that the step relations would be<br/>completely desorganized with the Blackjack set.</p><p>Starting from that it seemed clear that odd 11 couldn&apos;t be<br/>used to reorganize the melodic relations (even if it keeps<br/>sense vertically). Thus, seeking to reorganize the just<br/>relations in the 7-limit I used the following relation</p><p>  12/11 = 35/32 modulo 385/384</p><p>to find an optimal solution which requires to use also the<br/>step 5 with 7 and 9. I don&apos;t give more details since it&apos;s not<br/>a systematic approach.</p><p>-----</p><p>In the following graph the edges (--,\,---) correspond<br/>to (5,7,9).</p><p>     (2) seen as unison vector<br/>       \<br/> 0 ---  9<br/>  \      \<br/>   7 --- 16<br/>    \      \<br/>    14 --- 23 -- 28<br/>      \      \     \<br/>      21 --- 30 -- 35<br/>               \     \<br/>               37 -- 42 --- 51<br/>                 \     \      \<br/>                 44 -- 49 --- 58<br/>                         \      \<br/>                         56 --- 65<br/>                           \      \<br/>                           63 --- 72<br/>                             \<br/>                            (70) seen as unison vector</p><p>which is a regular lattice (in sense of &quot;treillis&quot;) if<br/>the unison vectors are removed.
