Carl Lumma?)</p><p>_The Waterfall_, from Eleven Intrusions.</p><p>&gt;and I certainly couldn&apos;t tell if it contained Just simultaneities<br/>&gt;or not, due to the previously mentioned rapidly decaying inharmonic<br/>&gt;timbres and rapid progress.</p><p>Listen again!  The adapted guitar (I think) plays clear just chords<br/>(which the &quot;waterfall&quot; marimba arpeggios retrace).  BTW, howabout<br/>the change on &quot;eager&quot;!</p><p>&gt;I have however examined some of Partch&apos;s tunings (reproduced<br/>&gt;from his mathematical description of them), and given the freedom to<br/>&gt;sustain their chords and use harmonic timbres, I am quite prepared<br/>&gt;to agree that they are just.</p><p>The chromelodeon parts are usually the best for hearing the JI.<br/>I like the 2-part harmony in the beginning of _Revelation_.  Thanks,<br/>Daniel, for the excerpt from _Ring Around the Moon_.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
