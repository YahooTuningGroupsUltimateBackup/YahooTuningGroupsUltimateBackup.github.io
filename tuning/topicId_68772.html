Ceramics are also tricky media, in that they shrink when dried or baked. Nonetheless, one can get some idea of what is going on with the relationship between the cavity and opening sizes with the small freeware program &quot;helmholz.exe&quot; which is floating around on the web.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
