Two guards are conversing.  One says to the other, &quot;He would like permission to make a small sacrifice.&quot;</p><p>According to Gilmore, Partch may have burned his early 12 tet compositions as early as 1926 rather in New Orleans in 1930.  Setting up any of his many addresses as a kind of altar would perhaps have both amused and horrified Partch, who was apparently only concerned that his work might survive and not that he would personally undergo some sort of pseudo-deification, no matter how much some of us who consider ourselves to be his disciples might feel that he deserves it.<br/>Still, historical markers or plaques would seem appropriate if funds could be found.  Partch was quite anathema to the sort of music museums where curious instruments could be seen but not played.  Fortunately, this has not thus far been the fate of his instruments.  Despite the modest notoriety he finally achieved during his lifetime, I suspect that he would be astonished that two major books have been printed about him, that more recordings than ever before are available, that several groups are still performing his pieces, that some of his instruments have been reproduced and that compositions are still being written using his scale.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a> 04/24/01 10:51AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Maybe this could be set up as a center so that those wanting to could go to burn their 12 et compositions, on a volunteer basis as part of the pilgrimage after riding the rails from San Francisco to Chicago</p><p>&quot;John F.
