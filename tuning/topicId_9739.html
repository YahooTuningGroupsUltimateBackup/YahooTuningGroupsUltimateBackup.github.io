I am practicing &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot; by the Rolling Stones<br/>on the guitar but I&apos;ve noticed that the guitar tuning has to be non-<br/>standard.  Can anyone tell me how to re-tune the guitar for this song?<br/>I&apos;ve heard that the Stones do use an alternative tuning and it<br/>probably was used in many of their older hits.  If I&apos;m way out of<br/>line with this group, let me know.  Thanks for any help...</p><p>Bill Bau</p></div>
