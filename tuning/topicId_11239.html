It has *two* CDs and includes CSound, a number of<br/>tutorials, oodles of sample code and some student compositions. Yes, the<br/>learning curve is a bit steep, but if you&apos;re at all good at<br/>edit-compile-debug cycles in any other programming context, you should pick<br/>up enough to do what you want. One other piece of software I recommend is<br/>&quot;Silence&quot;, which also includes CSound.
