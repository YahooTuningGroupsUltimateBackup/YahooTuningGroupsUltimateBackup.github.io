My comment is this (and this is not directed at<br/>Paul, it&apos;s a general thought I&apos;ve had for a while): to know a tuning, I<br/>believe, means a lot more than just playing the scale and listening to<br/>it. I think it means working with it, composing a number of songs in it,<br/>and seeing the deeper potentials of it. Just look at the amazing variety<br/>of music composed in 12 eq over the last few hundred years. I&apos;m sure<br/>some tunings will yield more than others over the long haul, depending<br/>on the depth and complexity of the tuning; I can forsee composing in 34<br/>for the rest of my life, not to mention 31 and 19 ( and many other eq<br/>temps). And, when we get into pure tunings, who knows where the limits<br/>are?

That said, I also want to make clear<br/>that I was merely curious as to whether Paul had dabbled with at<br/>least some of these tunings, and not that I was implying he *hadn&apos;t*,<br/>or painting anyone as merely a cataloger.</p><p>I am somewhat in the middle ground on this issue, at least<br/>intellectually: I am glad for all the work, past and present, that<br/>has been done to discover a myriad of tunings. Only by an ongoing<br/>search will we find those tunings, not yet used, that may lead to<br/>transcendant music. And yet - valuable as that search is - when the<br/>rubber meets the road, no one (recently) has phrased it any better<br/>than Dan Stearns in that interview posted yesterday:</p><p>&quot;...because when it comes right down to it I&apos;m much more interested<br/>in what someone does as opposed to what they did it with.&quot;</p><p>No shit.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   A few days ago, there was a short exchange between Szanto and<br/>Erlich,<br/>&gt; regarding a number of tunings; Paul had commented on the tunings,<br/>and<br/>&gt; Jon had wondered if Paul had ever actually listened to them, to<br/>which<br/>&gt; Paul replied that he had, in fact, listened to some of them, and<br/>knew<br/>&gt; what they sounded like.
