Alas, each zip file is the five pieces in 1 tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you don&apos;t have to download all 5 files, what kind of feedback<br/>did you expect to get? If I only downloaded the first file, should<br/>one be able to tell the tuning in use for those five examples without<br/>hearing any of the other tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, now that I see what is going on, I&apos;ll probably download them<br/>tonight when other things are happening...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>***Well, for purposes of this exercise, it might have been better to<br/>have had *one* piece in each .zip file, tuned the five different<br/>ways, rather than each .zip a different tuning of the five pieces.<br/>But too late now.  :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=43867 href="#43867">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2003 7:56:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_43429.html#43832">/tuning/topicId_43429.html#43832</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;So this is what I get:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;T1 = Werckmeister III<br/>&gt; &gt;T2 = Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt;T3 = Young<br/>&gt; &gt;T4 = 12 Equal<br/>&gt; &gt;T5 = Meantone<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Now, please embarass me by telling me how many are &quot;wrong...&quot;  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see someone else has voted on the poll page.
