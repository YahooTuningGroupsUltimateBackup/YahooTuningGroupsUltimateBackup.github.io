Someone asked me what it was and frankly i could explain, but to<br/>say that it is a way of intersecting a interval or something lame.<br/>Could some one explain it to me like i was really dumb (since i am<br/>really dumb). I want to have it clear in my head. I know that this is<br/>talked about in the Chalmers&apos;s book Divisions of the Tetrachord, but i<br/>don&apos;t have mine with me.</p><p>cheers,</p><p>kevin parks<br/>seoul, korea<br/><a href="mailto:kp87@lycos.com">kp87@lycos.com</a></p></div>
