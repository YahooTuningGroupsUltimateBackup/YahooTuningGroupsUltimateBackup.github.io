What happens if the weighting of fifths is<br/>reduced?</p><p>As for sinusoidal tunings, I invented one some time ago, which might<br/>be adjusted to the present situation.

General formula</p><p>D5 = S * 4/(16 + W5/W3)</p><p>where D5 is the deviation of the fifth, S is the comma and W5/W3 is<br/>the relative weighting factor.

This may be<br/>why modified meantones in the late Baroque period usually have C#<br/>major as the worst chord (see Lindley): the weighting gets shifted a<br/>bit sharpwards, on average.</p><p>One interesting, but somewhat offbeat thing, would be to try and<br/>reproduce Schlick.
