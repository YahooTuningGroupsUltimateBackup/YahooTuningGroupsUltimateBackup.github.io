There was a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; at one point when<br/>&gt; thirds and sixths moved from dissonant to consonant, and this<br/>&gt; is clear in the grammar of the musical examples that<br/>&gt; have survived.</p><p>Of course, Paul - I know this and am not arguing this point.<br/>Thanks anyway, because you&apos;ve expressed it well here.</p><p>My point was just that a person&apos;s understanding of what<br/>is going on harmonically (i.e., mathematically) is going<br/>to be limited by the knowledge and understanding he already<br/>has of mathematics and harmony.</p><p>Of course there are many musicians who are illiterate in<br/>terms of music-theory but who still have a great understanding<br/>and sensitivity to what&apos;s happening, purely *by ear*.</p><p>But that &apos;music-theory illiteracy&apos; makes them incapable of<br/>discussing or analyzing what they can experience, in words<br/>or numbers, beyond what they are able to understand.</p><p>For European theorists from the time of Charlemagne (i.e.,<br/>the rebirth of literacy altogether) to about 1200, when they<br/>began to get re-acquainted with the ancient Greek treatises<br/>(with their non-Pygathorean rational systems and the irrational<br/>systems of Aristoxenus), there simply was no way to express<br/>mathematically what *may* have been going on in practice.</p><p>My intention here is not to argue too strongly about what *was*<br/>going on in practice; I&apos;m just noting that theorists would have<br/>had difficulty discussing it if it *was* more complicated than<br/>a Pythagorean tuning, because Pythagoreanism was simply much<br/>easier  for their mathematics to handle than were other types of<br/>harmonic measurement.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget that at this time, mathematics still used<br/>the difficult-to-manipulate Roman numerals and had no concept<br/>of &apos;zero&apos;; this would have given music-theorists a very<br/>different view of things that what we are accustomed to today.</p><p>My effort in this thread is directed towards keeping people&apos;s<br/>minds open to the possibilities that may have been overlooked<br/>by theorists of the day.</p><p>After all, we don&apos;t have any recordings from back then, and<br/>the only way we can reconstruct what that music may have<br/>sounded like is thru the extant manuscripts, the contemporary<br/>theoretical descriptions, and the accumulation of knowledge<br/>on the subject since that time.  And all three of these types<br/>of sources are less than 100% clear and accurate on the matter.</p><p>I believe that leaves room for the type of speculation in<br/>which I like to indulge.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
