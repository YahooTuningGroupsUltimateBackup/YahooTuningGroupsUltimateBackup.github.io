First it was mainly didactic, as you very well just pointed in your example of Dudon(81/80) in the sense that it lights up a relation between some of our most common traditional scales (here the anhemitonic pentatonic scale) and some archetypal co&iuml;ncidences between harmonics (such as between 3 and 5 here with the syntonic comma). So the idea was to see if I could find other examples, and I did find many indeed. Then it was tempting to compare the musicality of all possible commas through this very basic traduction, and to compare musicalities produced by different limits, etc.  Also while doing this I started quickly to extend this idea to groups of two or three commas together, and to use it as a tool for scale creation.<br/>Another purpose was more directly related with a specific photosonic disk technique that I call omission, where I replace one black arc every one given number of them, by a blank space. This generates a subharmonic drone in polyphony. And commas are simply the kind of notes that will generate the more rich polyphonies.</p><p>&gt; (1) One thing it does is to find simple intervals between which there is the comma. For instance, Dudon(81/80) is 9/8-5/4-81/64-3/2-27/16-2, and between 5/4 and 81/64 there appears 81/80. Transposing this scale to its various modes, we find 10/9-9/8-4/3-3/2-16/9-2, and thus we see 81/80 appears between 10/9 and 9/8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) Tempering out the comma gives a scale tempered from the subgroup defined by the prime divisors of the numerator or denominator of the comma which is small but which actually does make use of the tempering. For instance, from Dudon(81/80) above we get Meantone[5].</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2013 8:35:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kleisma&quot;  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have added the possibility to create Dudon scales in Scala version 2.34a.

For instance, dudon(35/34)=dudon(48/35), 35/32, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4, 2. 48/35 is 385/384 flat of 11/8, and assuming 385/384 tempering you get that the scale can also be written 12/11, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4, 2. This  pentatonic scale looks quite interesting to me, and doesn&apos;t seem to be known. It&apos;s epimorphic, strictly proper, and (assuming tempering) full 11-limit. That&apos;s pretty impressive for a pentatonic!</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2013 8:22:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot;  wrote:<br/>This  pentatonic scale looks quite interesting to me, and doesn&apos;t seem to be known.
