Here is a little bit from the top of<br/>the page:</p><p><a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~kaper/Sonification/index.html">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~kaper/Sonification/index.html</a></p><p>The Scientific Sonification project is based on the concept that<br/>sounds are dynamic events which evolve in a multidimensional space.<br/>Each sound is a superposition of component<br/>waves (partials), whose evolution is determined by a set of static and<br/>dynamic control parameters. By defining a mapping from the data space<br/>to the sound space, we create a<br/>formalism for the faithful rendition of data in sounds.</p><p>Our research focuses on establishing coordinate systems in sound space<br/>that optimize the aural perception of given data sets and their<br/>salient features. The data sets are taken from<br/>large-scale scientific computations; so far, we have rendered data<br/>from computational chemistry, materials science, and computer science.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
