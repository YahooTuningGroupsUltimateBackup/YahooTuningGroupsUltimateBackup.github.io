As some of you know, I have been working myself<br/>into the maqam world by learning how to play the<br/>Turkish ney, and the result has been that these maqams<br/>have changed my emotional life - they haunt me at<br/>night in my sleep because my brain is working on them<br/>like on a new language, and they allow me to not only<br/>express new feelings, but also HAVE new feelings. In<br/>my frequent conversations with Turks living in<br/>Germany, I will tell them that I know they feel<br/>differently, because if they didn&apos;t they wouldn&apos;t have<br/>the music they have, but as I know their music now (a<br/>little) I know about the emotional difference. And<br/>that includes PAST emotions, for me this is like<br/>having been introduced to the emotions of Turks living<br/>in the 18th century or earlier. Of course you need<br/>order, and you have autopoietic evolution, and thus<br/>you never know how the past really felt, but that is a<br/>hermeneutic problem which applies to all communication<br/>systems. The memory is in the current meaning, no<br/>communication ever &quot;forgets&quot;.<br/>Michael</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/>How much free photo storage do you get?

I meant<br/>like this:</p><p>&gt; Not a single work<br/>&gt; was lame, or worth<br/>&gt; forgetting about.</p><p>How would we know that? Surely only the ones remaining<br/>are the ones which were woth remembering, so, all<br/>those not worth remembering are forgotten, so how<br/>would we know now if there were any not worth<br/>remembering, as they would have been forgotten anyway<br/>(and so not even appear to have existed)?</p><p>&gt; Nobody in the 19th century, for example, wrote lame<br/>&gt; virtuoso music that<br/>&gt; was devoid of any depth,  or even entertaining.</p><p>Same point. Maybe they did but is has not survived for<br/>us to know about as it was not worth surviving.</p><p>But, I really enjoyed your response anyway. Good on<br/>you.
