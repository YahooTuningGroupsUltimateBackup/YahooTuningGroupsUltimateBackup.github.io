Here&apos;s the relevant section:</p><p>&quot;One of the keys on the keyboard is set to be the reference key, relative to which all the other keys are defined. The reference key is identified by row (Ref Key Row) and column (Ref Key Column) according to the chart. The pitch produced by this key is defined as a MIDI note number. The pitch of the other keys is defined by the horizontal step size (Across) and vertical step size (Down). For convenience in calculating these step sizes you can set the number of steps per octave (which defaults to 12).&quot;</p><p>So Danny Weir&apos;s suggestion was to include a keyboard mapping for miracle temperament, where the horizontal step is 7 steps of 72-ET, and the vertical step is 2 steps of 72-ET, and middle C (MIDI note 60) is assigned to the Q key (row 2, column 0).</p></div><h3><a id=71927 href="#71927">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2007 12:03:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Herman,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Danny Wier wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; You should add one more scale to the archive:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ref Key (y): 2<br/>&gt; &gt; Ref Key (x): 0<br/>&gt; &gt; Pitch: 60 (if you want 1/1 = middle C, of course)<br/>&gt; &gt; Across: 7<br/>&gt; &gt; Down: 2<br/>&gt; &gt; Steps per octave: 72<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and that gives you MIRACLE, 72-edo version.
