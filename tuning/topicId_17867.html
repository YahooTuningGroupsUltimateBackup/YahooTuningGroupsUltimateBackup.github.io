However, the string tension is far lower than that of a piano, despite the similarity in length.<br/>If you want to do a lot of retuning on a piano, you may wear out the holes that the tuning pegs are in, the pin block.  Even on an older piano, tuned many times over the years, this can be a problem.  There is a fluid called &quot;pin block restorer&quot; which helps to overcome this by swelling the wood.  It only takes a drop or two around the base of each &quot;pin&quot; (or tuning peg).  If your piano is an upright, you may need to lay it on its back first, a job for at least two very strong people.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:twilcox@patriot.net">twilcox@patriot.net</a> 01/23/01 12:44PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>JdL wrote:<br/>&gt; Real-time adaptive tuning by program is, in my experience,<br/>&gt; difficult or<br/>&gt; even impossible to get right.
