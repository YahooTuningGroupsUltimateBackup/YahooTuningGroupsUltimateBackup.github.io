There seem to be lots out<br/>there with rates ~$50 per year (which sounds good) but I find a site then do<br/>a search to see opinions and come across people saying &quot;they suck&quot; so I&apos;m<br/>wondering if anyone here has experience with webhosting that doesn&apos;t cost an<br/>arm and a leg? We musicians need places we can put up as many mp3s as we<br/>want without bandwidth problems and without having to wait for them to be<br/>cleared!!!</p><p>thanks</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3><a id=38727 href="#38727">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2002 2:32:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dante,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi I know this is not strictly appropriate for this list</p><p>I&apos;ll be brief, since I&apos;m &apos;bending the rules&apos; too: you might want to take a look at <a href="http://www.catalog.com/">http://www.catalog.com/</a> which I&apos;m using for <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a>.
