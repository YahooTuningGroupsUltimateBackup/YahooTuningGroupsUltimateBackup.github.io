While I can<br/>understand lots of JI ratios, and can recognize a few of them<br/>like 1.5 (i.e. 3/2) in decimal form, cents for irrational ratios<br/>are much clearer; and when JI ratios are given in cents, I can<br/>usually recognize them fairly easily. Thus I&apos;d suggest that, when<br/>in doubt, you use cents. For JI ratios, the fractional form is<br/>fine, but the decimal form not so transparent, even with<br/>something as simple as 9/8 vs. 1.125.</p><p>As to the scale, I might offer a few comments with the big<br/>caution that while I recognize lots of the sizes as in familiar<br/>regions for me, the idea of a scale with a periodicity at Phi<br/>rather than 2/1 is something I&apos;ve heard about but not used. What<br/>I&apos;m looking at here is more tetrachords and pentachords, which<br/>put me on a more familiar ground.</p><p>You have a very interesting tetrachord 0-236-274-466, which in JI<br/>terms might be rather like 1/1-8/7-7/6-21/16 (0-231-267-471). The<br/>very small &quot;semitone&quot; or diesis between your large tone and small<br/>minor third at 236 and 274 cents -- the latter of which could be<br/>interpreted as 75/64 also in terms of size -- at around 38 cents<br/>might in JI terms be a 49/48.</p><p>This is where having your step at 236 cents rather than the Noble<br/>Mediant near 243 cents does make a difference, melodically: you<br/>have enough space, 38 cents rather than a bare 30 cents, to have<br/>the feeling of a distinct albeit very small &quot;semitone&quot; rather<br/>than maybe only a large comma.</p><p>Robert the Inventor used this 49/48 step some years ago in a<br/>&quot;sad&quot; European Dorian mode: 1/1 8/7 7/6 4/3 3/2 12/7 7/4 2/1<br/>(0-231-267-498-702-933-969-1200 cents). See if you don&apos;t like the<br/>special melodic feeling of 0-236-273-466 cents in your scale, or<br/>maybe a pentachord adding your narrow fifth, 0-236-273-466-684<br/>cents.</p><p>A comment about your 367-cent interval: unless you&apos;re a spccial<br/>16/13 fan, I&apos;d say that 21/17 is a better description of this<br/>flavor. While 16/13 (359 cents) is a large neutral third, it&apos;s<br/>still for me at the high end of the central neutral region rather<br/>distinct from major or minor. By the point we get to the<br/>mid-360&apos;s, however, a friend of mine and I have both concluded<br/>that were really in &quot;submajor&quot; territory: 367 is a like a small,<br/>active, and beautiful major third or ditone! Thus if I were<br/>describing this tuning, or looking for a JI version, I&apos;d go with<br/>21/17 (366 cents).</p><p>We could get more into tetrachords, but I wanted to let you know<br/>that it was fun to confirm your tuning in cents -- corrections<br/>are welcome, and I used a value for Phi of 1.618034.</p><p>It was neat how that small 236-273 cent step immediately reminded<br/>me of Robert&apos;s septimal Dorian from a few years back. That,<br/>alone, would be good reason to explore your scale further!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=94288 href="#94288">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 4:43:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Michael. For reference, why don&apos;t I include again the Scala<br/>file for your scale (hoping again that I got it right):</p><p>! sheiman_michael-phi_section.scl<br/>!<br/>Michael Sheiman&apos;s Phi Section scale, from Tuning List<br/> 9<br/>!<br/> 149.46400<br/> 235.77400<br/> 273.02400<br/> 366.91000<br/> 466.18100<br/> 560.56600<br/> 597.31600<br/> 683.62700<br/> 833.09000</p><p>&gt; Of course...there&apos;s ongoing debate over whether fractions or<br/>&gt; cents are better...if I do either without the other someone<br/>&gt; will mind. :-D</p><p>Here I&apos;d say that the most important guideline is that many of us<br/>understand either cents or _integer ratios_ (&quot;JI fractions&quot; as<br/>you call them below) such as 9/8 or 9:8 much better and faster<br/>than a fraction expressed in decimal form. Thus either 9/8 or<br/>203.91 cents is fine, and both would be ideal; but 1.125 is<br/>harder for most of us to read. It&apos;s not the fraction, but the<br/>decimal form, that causes the problem in comprehension.</p><p>Thus I&apos;d say, &quot;Use either cents or integer ratios, or often<br/>ideally both&quot; is a good guideline, along with &quot;When in doubt, use<br/>cents.&quot;</p><p>This is maybe a quirk of musical mathematics, because in lots of<br/>areas of life, we tend to prefer decimal fractions like 1.6. But<br/>in tuning math, 8/5 or 814 cents is instantly and effortlessly<br/>recognized, while 1.6 requires (at least for me) a bit of<br/>thought. This isn&apos;t to say that some people don&apos;t use decimal<br/>forms extensively, or that there&apos;s anything wrong with them in<br/>themselves, for example to show how a calculation is done. However, especially in a listing or file for a tuning, my rule<br/>would be always to use either integer ratios or cents or both.</p><p>&gt;  But, fair enough, I shouldn&apos;t have been so lazy as to leave my<br/>&gt;  values in decimal form and should have converted them to cents<br/>&gt;  and not just &quot;nearest fairly low-limit JI fractions&quot;...and I<br/>&gt;  do have Scala (only I used another program to convert decimal<br/>&gt;  to cents when I do so).</p><p>Please let me say that the JI integer ratios that you suggested<br/>were very interesting, and comparing views on how a given<br/>irrational tuning might be approximated by such ratios is<br/>something lots of us here enjoy. These views can and will differ,<br/>of course, and that&apos;s part of the fun. As you now understand, the<br/>only problem was getting a file or listing of your scale in cents<br/>also.</p><p>Also, in fairness, I should confess that I often have a tendency<br/>to mention some rather complex JI ratio such as 56/39 without<br/>giving the size in cents (here about 626 cents). If people aren&apos;t<br/>already familiar with the ratio, that isn&apos;t so helpful. Let me<br/>resolve to do better from now on.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;You have a very interesting tetrachord 0-236-274-466, which<br/>&gt;&gt; in JI terms might be rather like 1/1-8/7-7/6-21/16<br/>&gt;&gt; (0-231-267-471). The very small &quot;semitone&quot; or diesis between<br/>&gt;&gt; your large tone and small minor third at 236 and 274 cents&quot;</p><p>&gt; Interesting because when I composed with the scale in the past,<br/>&gt; I avoided having &quot;8/7&quot; and &quot;7/6&quot; in the same chord because I<br/>&gt; was afraid they were comma-tic, but now you&apos;re letting me know<br/>&gt; it is just far enough apart to be interpreted as otherwise.</p><p>This raises an interesting point on which I&apos;ll give my view with<br/>a caution that I&apos;m certainly ready to here that others see things<br/>differently.</p><p>To me, the fact that two notes in a scale like 7/6 and 8/7 (or<br/>your 235 and 273 cents) have between them a small interval that&apos;s<br/>a fine melodic step, here around 38 cents, doesn&apos;t necessarily<br/>mean that you&apos;d want to use that interval simultaneously, in a<br/>chord. They&apos;re two different questions: you might routinely use<br/>it melodically, but consider using it simultaneously or<br/>harmonically more as a &quot;special effect.&quot;</p><p>While many people would think of something like 38 cents as a<br/>comma, a term used very widely, I&apos;d call it a small diesis: an<br/>interval large enough to be felt distinctly as a melodic step,<br/>and yet small enough to be felt as distinct from a usual<br/>&quot;semitone.&quot;</p><p>The upper limit for a &quot;comma&quot; in the narrow sense, something a<br/>bit small to be felt as a distinct step (although a very slow<br/>tempo can often help), might be around 30 cents or a bit more.</p><p>In general, while a small melodic step can be very refreshing,<br/>using it as an interval in a chord should be carefully<br/>considered. Often a result is high dissonance -- although at<br/>times that&apos;s just what we might want.</p><p>In fact, when we get in the range of 50-70 cents, such an<br/>interval might be very effective both melodically and vertically<br/>in some appropriate harmonic or contrapuntal setting. George<br/>Secor and I have both noted this, with his focus especially on<br/>semitones of around 60-80 cents.</p><p>There are situations where small dieses and even commas can be<br/>used effectively as harmonic intervals or in chords. One of them,<br/>for example, is in the &quot;complex unisons&quot; and compressed or<br/>stretched octaves of gamelan, where the beating is part of the<br/>desired texture.</p><p>Another is a wonderful effect George Secor pulled off, playing a<br/>13th-century European dance with voices a Pythagorean comma apart<br/>creating a &quot;chorusing&quot; effect.</p><p>What I would want to caution against -- in least from my view --<br/>is the idea that a good scale is meant to have all the steps, or<br/>as many as possible, used together in a single chord. There are<br/>pentatonic scales, for example, which nicely lend themselves to<br/>this; but this isn&apos;t what I&apos;d generally expect.</p><p>Then, again, given my own musical background, I often tend to<br/>regard a single voice alone as beautiful melody (and the basis of<br/>mnay world musical cultures); two as company; three as quite<br/>rich; and four as very rich. So this business of stacking up<br/>lots of notes at once, common of course in lots of musical<br/>styles, is not what I would myself assume in looking at a scale,<br/>although that doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s in any way wrong.</p><p>&gt; A comment about your 367-cent interval: unless you&apos;re a spccial<br/>&gt; 16/13 fan, I&apos;d say that 21/17 is a better description of this<br/>&gt; flavor.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  Could very well be, I just used 16/13 as I figured it would be<br/>&gt;  easier for people to calculate JI-style relationships with<br/>&gt;  being 13 limit and not 21 limit.</p><p>You&apos;re probably right that 16/13 might be better known that<br/>21/17, but there is an interesting quirk in this that George<br/>Secor pointed out to me around late 2001.</p><p>If our object is to divide a fifth into just two neutral thirds<br/>with the simplest odd ratio for the division as a whole, then the<br/>simplest division is actually 14:17:21, with our larger 21:17<br/>third at around 366 cents and the smaller 17:14 at around 336<br/>cents. While either 11:9 or 16:13 has a lower odd ratio than<br/>either 17:14 or 21:17, their simplest divisions of the fifth are<br/>18:22:27 (for 11:9 at 347 cents, with 27:22 at 355 cents); or<br/>32:39:48 (for 16:13 at 359 cents, with 39:32 at 342 cents).</p><p>Actually, while this kind of calculation may (or may not) be<br/>very interesting on paper, I&apos;d say the various neutral shadings<br/>(not necessarily just!) are all beautiful and worth exploring.</p><p>Here it&apos;s maybe a question of how fine a scale of mapping. Certainly 366 cents isn&apos;t far from 16/13, and it may be mainly<br/>the &quot;locals&quot; to this part of the spectrum who will tell you:<br/>&quot;Yes, you&apos;re in the same general neighborhood as 16/13, but just<br/>a bit wider, with 21/17 as almost a kind of GPS address.&quot;</p><p>In musical terms, one might say that 16/13 sounds more like a<br/>clearly neutral third, and 21/17 more like a &quot;submajor&quot; third<br/>leaning toward a major quality -- but impressions can definitely<br/>vary. If you explore this region, you may find it interesting to<br/>see how your perceptions develop (as I&apos;ve been doing).</p><p>&gt;&gt; We could get more into tetrachords, but I wanted to let you<br/>&gt;&gt; know that it was fun to confirm your tuning in cents -- &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; corrections are welcome, and I used a value for Phi of &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1.618034.</p><p>&gt;  Glad you enjoyed it.  I&apos;ll have to double check but (for once)<br/>&gt;  it looks like you (unlike many others) have finally converted<br/>&gt;  this scale correctly. :-D</p><p>Since no one here is infallible, checking it out would be very<br/>wise, and again I would apologize for any mistakes, since I know<br/>that creating a scale like this is an effort that it&apos;s important<br/>to honor by being careful that we get it right.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s the odd thing about this scale though: that Phi is<br/>&gt; indeed the period and neither PHI nor anything else in ideal<br/>&gt; form, is rounded to JI.  In fact I&apos;ve found (both in the past<br/>&gt; and in a few recent &quot;re-tests&quot;) doing things like making the<br/>&gt; Wolf fifth into a pure fifth or using the low-limit 13/8 as PHI<br/>&gt; or using 2/1 as the period actually tends to upset the sense of<br/>&gt; balance of the scale for composing.</p><p>While 13/8 is a wonderful interval, it&apos;s no replacement for Phi,<br/>which might better be approximated by 21/13 (830 cents), or<br/>closer yet by 34/21 (834 cents). All these neutral sixths are<br/>part of the Fibonacci series leading to Phi itself -- and here<br/>the more complex the ratio along this series, the better the<br/>approximation.</p><p>Maybe the operative rule is an axiom of a woman named Nicole<br/>Lennon in Australia about dog training that can also apply to<br/>humans and tunings alike: &quot;Work with the personality of the dog<br/>you&apos;ve got, rather than trying to impose a boring one of your<br/>own.&quot;</p><p>And a neat aspect I haven&apos;t looked at is that since Phi is the<br/>periodicity, we&apos;ll get intervals repeating at this periodicity,<br/>not the same as 2/1! I&apos;d didn;t really look at that in Scala, but<br/>it could give us all kinds of rich resources for this scale.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
