The assignment was</p><p>Assignment 1 - instructions - transcribe the Enigma theme by Edward Elgar<br/>into any un12 equal tuning system you wish to use. Goal - it must be<br/>recognizable. Assignment 2 - repeat the theme four times - once solo, then<br/>harmonized with another line (2 voice), two more lines, and finally 4<br/>lines.

I should have realised (but then it took a while for me to detect and correct an Ab instead of a G# in the final chord!) I will have to look at how to fix this (I am using Scala).
