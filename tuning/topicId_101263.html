Also I was also<br/>&gt; curious to hear 5edo under my fingers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, thanks. And please (anyone else) don&apos;t be afraid to bash the song or<br/>&gt; the tuning or whatever... just do it constructively!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, if anyone can recommend guitar tunings for 11edo, I&apos;ll be playing<br/>&gt; around with that next.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a tech writer and engineer-in-training, located in northern Alabama.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m finally chiming in because...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Last night I realized that because my old acoustic-electric guitar has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a floating bridge, a few non-12 EDOs lay within my grasp! Up until now<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my exploration had mostly been in Scala and Csound (and lots of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reading), and mostly in just intonation. I tried for 10edo, which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; seemed to work all right, so I bashed out my first* little piece of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; xenharmonics: Cataract for 10-EDO Guitar and Voice. Hope you like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20YIQ_WhDYk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20YIQ_WhDYk</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Constructive feedback is most welcome; just know I am pretty much a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; total beginner at this. Apologies in advance for the poor vocal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intonation and the general stumbling around on the fretboard -- I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly a flute player nowadays. And wow, singing in 10edo was not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; easy! Hopefully the intentions are clear enough.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The guitar is tuned with 360 cents between each pair of strings,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; giving fretboard isomorphism and some semblance of the standard guitar<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning. 5th string is tuned to around C3.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Jason Conklin<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Welcome to the community Jason! Surprisingly a lot of members on this list<br/>&gt; &gt; have degrees in engineering or are pursuing one. We only have one rule here<br/>&gt; &gt; which is don&apos;t mention the word &quot;Pi,&quot; or Mike will ban you.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Your song is very interesting, it shows a tonal side of 10-equal which is<br/>&gt; &gt; rarely experienced. Some people see 10-equal and laugh at the theory behind<br/>&gt; &gt; it, but hearing a composition is a much different story.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Flute and guitar are both great instruments for experimenting in the<br/>&gt; &gt; xenharmonic realm. I myself play flute, which is great for pitch bends (it<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds especially good when playing subminor thirds and mavila-esque<br/>&gt; &gt; melodies). Guitar is a little harder as it requires a different fretboard,<br/>&gt; &gt; or a floating bridge in your case.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hope to hear some more musical works from you!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ryan<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
