Say, if we could just<br/>figure this out and quantify it then we could make an<br/>algorithm to write beautiful music and then we could all<br/>go home and stop working ourselves to death trying to be<br/>artists -- we&apos;ll replace all the artists with computers,<br/>and then we&apos;ll have more time to watch wrassling matches<br/>on TV. :-\</p><p>OK but actually, you know, the Greeks I think were the<br/>only ones that I&apos;m aware of who came up with anything at<br/>all that could be helpful here. Their theory of art and<br/>architecture, which I presume extended to music as well<br/>did have some useful tips. And from these tips I think we<br/>can actually formulate a theory of WHAT TO DO TO MAKE<br/>MUSIC THAT SUCKS. Once we have completely answered this<br/>question in every possible way (which I am **strongly**<br/>advocating we try), then whatever is left is THE ANSWER TO<br/>JACKY&apos;S QUESTION. See, it&apos;s like the prime numbers -- take<br/>away every single possible pattern annd what is left is<br/>the prime numbers. That&apos;s the *only* way to define them!<br/>By making a list of what they are not!! There&apos;s lots of<br/>difficult -- say impossible -- questions for which this<br/>is the only approach you can take.</p><p>OK, getting back to the clever and insightful Greeks:</p><p>1) Have repetition, but don&apos;t make it exact.<br/>2) Have symmetry, but don&apos;t make it perfect.<br/>3) Model things on patterns found in nature:<br/>   a) Use the golden ratio.</p><p>OK, so #1 is the one I like today. Have you ever heard<br/>a techno track where the first two measures are<br/>the most beautiful thing and you are thinking: Wow!<br/>And then the next 1000 measures are the exact same<br/>loop played back with no variation whatsoever and<br/>you fling the CD out the window, screaming and<br/>then you fall on the floor, writhing about in anger<br/>and frustration? Yeah, you know it! Exact repetition<br/>SUCKS BIG TIME.</p><p>So you&apos;ve got a sequencer and you say hey this<br/>composition stuff is no big deal -- I&apos;ll just<br/>copy this measure a million times and then<br/>improvise on top of it!</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ve done that and sure it is fun. But,<br/>you know it ain&apos;t no good since it drives people<br/>nuts. So if you do use that method, at least do<br/>something else with it like:</p><p>1. Go in an&apos; make little changes to every one<br/>   of the repeated measures so they aren&apos;t all<br/>   the same.</p><p>or</p><p>2. Once you got a certain amount of stuff going on,<br/>   toss out the original ostinato track.</p><p>or</p><p>3. Rerecord the pattern track in real time so<br/>   that there are variations.</p><p>or</p><p>4. Don&apos;t make those copies to begin with, but<br/>   thorough-compose everything.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t make it perfect&quot;:</p><p>1. Please do not quantize everything. Kindly<br/>   let it breath.<br/>2. Stay away from small exactly just ratios.<br/>3. Never ever ever ever use a 1200.00000 cent octave.<br/>   They are not found in nature!!!!!<br/>4. What is with every velocity on this entire<br/>   track is 64?? And why is every note exactly<br/>   384 ticks long?? If you are doing this you<br/>   do not know what you are doing!</p><p>Back to &quot;no exact copies&quot;:</p><p>Be _real_ careful if using digital instruments, or<br/>particularly sampling. Do *something* to break up the<br/>monotony. Use some FM or PWM or physical modelling. Stay<br/>away from those sounds that just rapidly converge upon a<br/>completely unnatural phase-locked integer harmonic sustain<br/>loop. (That means most of the synths and sound cards out<br/>there, by the way.) Or just use some acoustic instruments.<br/>And don&apos;t use a drum machine if you can avoid it. If you<br/>can&apos;t get &apos;real&apos; drums, record your stapler, your<br/>scissors, the banging of a can of coffee or a tin of<br/>ship&apos;s biscuits, sticks knocked together, rocks, flower<br/>pots, fingernail clippings transposed down 4 octaves,<br/>frogs, terapins... percussion is everywhere!</p><p>Dan&apos;t stick all your instruments in the middle<br/>of the speakers and leave them there. Please!!<br/>No real instruments stay in the exact same place.<br/>Even seated orchestra members fidget and shift<br/>about, changing the sound subtlely.</p><p>Now that I am thinking about it, the albums that<br/>I end up really listening to over and over always<br/>have lots of little secrets -- little sounds and<br/>touches and subtleties that I never noticed before<br/>that after listening to them the 1000th time I notice<br/>for the first time. It&apos;s a wonderful feeling finding<br/>some interesting little detail hidden in the mix.<br/>As an example, I&apos;ll mention all of the Beatles<br/>albums from Sgt. Pepper onwards.</p><p>It&apos;s like when you have been driving your car for<br/>ten years and one day you look down and you say,<br/>&quot;Hey, what&apos;s this switch??&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s like when you walk past a vacant lot every<br/>day for two years and then one day the vacant lot<br/>is no longer there and in its place is a 100 year<br/>old building that is surrounded with overgrown<br/>bushes and vines and you know that you have shifted<br/>into a parallel universe. Or when you go to the<br/>supermarket and say &quot;Don&apos;t you have any of those<br/>blue grapefruits?&quot; and they say &quot;There is no<br/>such thing! Grapefruits are pink!&quot; And you<br/>say &quot;Huh? Since when?&quot;</p><p>I could go on with these examples but I&apos;ll stop.<br/>I do think that cataloguing these things is<br/>a great idea and lots of fun!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=20235 href="#20235">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2001 1:44:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;J Scott&quot; &lt;xjscott@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20229.html#20229">/tuning/topicId_20229.html#20229</a></p><p>&gt; OK, getting back to the clever and insightful Greeks:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Have repetition, but don&apos;t make it exact.<br/>&gt; 2) Have symmetry, but don&apos;t make it perfect.<br/>&gt; 3) Model things on patterns found in nature:<br/>&gt;    a) Use the golden ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so #1 is the one I like today.
