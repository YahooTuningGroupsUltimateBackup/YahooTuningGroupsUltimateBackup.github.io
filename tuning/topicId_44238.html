But I noticed a few terms, or<br/>&gt; concepts are lacking. There is for example no entry<br/>&gt; on difference tones, which is the basis on my research on<br/>&gt; &quot;differential coherence&quot;, the subject of an article<br/>&gt; I wrote in 1998, first published in french and translated<br/>&gt; recently in the last 1/1 journal issue. Differential<br/>&gt; coherence is used in my CD Lumi&iuml;&iquest;&half;res audibles (1996),<br/>&gt; and in many other pieces of mine and a few other<br/>&gt; composers ; It has been discussed briefly in the tuning<br/>&gt; list, where Gene proposed an improved formal definition<br/>&gt; of it ; it has been implemented recently by Manuel Op<br/>&gt; de Coul in the last version of Scala ; It is also the<br/>&gt; basis of another area or research of our group called<br/>&gt; the &quot;fractal series&quot;, and the &quot;fractal waveforms&quot; where<br/>&gt; timber and intonation become a single thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a very practical thing, whose qualities have been<br/>&gt; tested through many studies we did collectively here<br/>&gt; in the permanent psychoacoustic workshop of the AEH.<br/>&gt; And I can give exemples of how most traditional scales<br/>&gt; are strongly differentially coherent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am nowadays completing a database of differential-coherent<br/>&gt; scales (I don&apos;t know if I should say &quot;differentially coherent&quot;<br/>&gt; or differential-coherent&quot;, whatever) which will be published<br/>&gt; in our website (in progress) as soon as I reach a significant<br/>&gt; number.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it should be mentionned in your dictionnary, as one<br/>&gt; simple and very powerful tool for sound exploration.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not very complex either and I can help you to resume<br/>&gt; it in a few words - except that english is not my native<br/>&gt; language.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; and good luck also for tonalsoft...<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Jacques Dudon - Atelier d&apos;Exploration Harmonique<br/>&gt; Les Camails<br/>&gt; 83340  Le Thoronet - France<br/>&gt; tel +fax : 33 (0)494 73 87 78<br/>&gt; 2nd tel +messages : 33 (0)494 73 80 25<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:aeh@free.fr">mailto:aeh@free.fr</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://aeh.free.fr">http://aeh.free.fr</a></p></div>
