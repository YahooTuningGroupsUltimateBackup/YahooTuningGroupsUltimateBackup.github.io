I&apos;d be willing to accept a<br/>new, used, or tattered copy, or even one chewed by Fido! Anyone<br/>willing to lend a copy, allow me to photocopy portions? I&apos;m doing<br/>research on 19th century alternatives to ET and everyone tells me<br/>that this is the book I must read, but it is proving to be as elusive<br/>as the Holy Grail.</p><p>Any help or leads will be most appreciated.</p><p>Greg Vozar</p><p>Homepage: <a href="http://www.bandoneons.com/">http://www.bandoneons.com/</a><br/>The Classical Free-Reed: <a href="http://trfn.clpgh.org/free-reed/">http://trfn.clpgh.org/free-reed/</a></p></div>
