I shall just chop stuff out and respond.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I tend to feel that 1900 is more meaningful as the date of</p><p>&gt; &gt; complete domination of 12-tET because it was around that time</p><p>&gt; &gt; that composers started using the 12 chromatic notes as an</p><p>&gt; &gt; entity in itself,</p><p>   I agree.  I believe the major part of the thread seems to be keyboard<br/>related, and my study of the history of keyboard tuning tells me that 1900 is<br/>a very logical place to locate the widespread use of ET on keyboards.  It was<br/>an age where the infatuation with science had its effect on composers as well<br/>as instrument makers. It is also the era that Helmholtz&apos;s writings were able<br/>to be put into actual effect. Combined with the 1911 or so writings of Jerry<br/>Fischer and William Braid-White, pianos were finally being tuned in strict<br/>ET.<br/>   Jorgensen posits that the techniques required to tune an ET on keyboard<br/>didn&apos;t exist for any practical tuner before this time.  Montal had published<br/>a book in 1834 that gives info which would make ET possible, but we hear<br/>nothing of it for 60 years following, so I don&apos;t think it is plausible.(his<br/>instructions are also incredibly difficult to put into actual practise,<br/>further supporting my skepticism of ET being used)</p><p>&gt;&gt;Certainly Chopin used all 12 notes in ways that make the most</p><p>sense when tuned as 12-tET.</p><p>    I must respectfully disagree.  In a well tempered tuning, the keys with 4<br/>or more accidentals have a particular quality of contrast, ie.  Whereas the<br/>harmony, whose tonal image is dependant on the quality of the thirds, is<br/>&quot;active&quot;,  those keys also contain purer fifths.  This juxtapostion of<br/>harmony provides a distinct character to these keys.  Chopin&apos;s music goes<br/>very well on the tunings of 1800.  That is not to say there are alternatives,<br/>one of which appears on our next well-tempered piano CD.  We use the DeMorgan<br/>tuning, which reverses the order of key color,  for Chopin&apos;s fantasy 66.  I<br/>will await a response on this when the CD is available, as it IS an<br/>avante-garde offering.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d say that Beethoven was really</p><p>the first composer to exploit the unique possibilities of</p><p>12-tET in a serious way.  His use of surprise modulations, etc.,</p><p>could not have been done in meantone or well-temperament, which</p><p>are what I assume he grew up with. &lt;&lt;</p><p>    Whoa!  This is totally opposite to my experience, as well as every<br/>classical pianist I have been able to get my tuning hammer near.  Beethoven&apos;s<br/>music displays a very logical use of key color available from the well<br/>temperaments.  His modulations obey all the conventions of key-character.<br/>What is so dramatic in his music is how far he is able to carry the listener<br/>into the extreme keys and how vivid his modulations are between them.  The<br/>second mvt. of the Waldstein displays this with tremendous clarity.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I think Beethoven&apos;s pieces</p><p>are both a reflection of and a stimulus for the further</p><p>acceptance of 12-tET as a standard tuning.  So this is around</p><p>1800-1825.&lt;&lt;<br/>   There is no evidence that any keyboard maker of the time was interested in<br/>ET, and there is scant evidence that any musician would have accepted it.<br/>There is much evidence of opposition to the concept, though.  Coupled with<br/>the lack of any usuable techniques to achieve it, I can find nothing to<br/>support the use of ET in the early to mid 1800&apos;s.  One of the few bits of<br/>evidence are quotes from A.J. Hipkins that none of the Broadwood tuners of<br/>1850 tuned &quot;anything like ET&quot;, and the Ellis documentation, as presented by<br/>Jorgensen, that in 1885, the Broadwood tuners were still following<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s principles, albeit in a very subtle shape.</p><p>&gt;The entire 19th century was thus a time when 12-tET slowly</p><p>&gt;gained acceptance.  I would argue that as late as the 1880s</p><p>&gt;and 1890s composers of even very experimental music (say,</p><p>&gt;Mahler) were still regularly using harmonies that were based</p><p>&gt;on JI or meantone theory.&lt;&lt;</p><p>    ET was accepted in the non-keyboard world during the 19th century, yes.<br/>The use of machine made horns required a universal intonation,(McClaren<br/>writes of this in some very compelling posts of the early to mid 1990&apos;s).<br/>However, it is a lot easier to make an ET flute or fretted instrument than it<br/>is to aurally render 12 notes into an organization.</p><p>&gt;&gt;From a tuning standpoint, what really characterizes an ET in an immediately</p><p>audible way is the melodic smoothness of the chromatic scale, and this is</p><p>where I would say Chopin&apos;s music may have been the first to exploit this</p><p>feature as a compositional resource. I&apos;m hard pressed to think of any 20th</p><p>century compositional technique that necessitates ET more directly and</p><p>convincingly than this.&gt;&gt;</p><p>  From a tuning standpoint, the main feature of ET is a sameness to the keys.<br/> Also, pianists that have familiarized themselves with well tempered<br/>keyboards find that ET has a very &quot;busy&quot; sound. Adjectives that I<br/>consistantly hear include &quot;buzzy&quot;, restless, sour, and &quot;out of tune<br/>everywhere&quot;!.<br/>   In the recording studios here that I tune in well temperaments, the<br/>guitarists seem to feel that their instruments mesh with the piano a lot<br/>better, and the general feeling is that the WT pianos sound more in<br/>tune.(Nancy Griffith&apos;s next CD is done with a piano tuned in a Thomas Young<br/>temperament, as are all of the recordings done by Steve Earle)</p><p>    It is important to define what I mean by ET.  The use of the tuning<br/>computers allows me to produce a clinical version of this, in which the<br/>thirds progress evenly.  The variation from this that is discernable to my<br/>most sensitive customers is about 2 cents.  Below that, and all keys are<br/>accepted as equal.  This limit is surpassed by even the latest well<br/>tempereaments.<br/>   I hate to talk before I walk,  but we are still waiting on the record<br/>company to finish our next CD.  In it, there is a range of tunings, from 1/4C<br/>meantone to the latest Victorian style.  When it comes available, I will be<br/>sure to post here.<br/>Regards to all,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html">http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

I should have<br/>qualified it more: &quot;Certainly Chopin *sometimes* used all<br/>12 notes...&quot;.</p><p>To my knowledge, I have never heard Chopin&apos;s music in any<br/>tuning other than (ostensible) 12-tET.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d say that Beethoven was really the first composer<br/>&gt; &gt; to exploit the unique possibilities of 12-tET in a serious<br/>&gt; &gt; way.

I suppose here I need to defer to your much greater<br/>experience in dealing with Beethoven&apos;s music in well-temperaments.</p><p>I know his music very well, and my comments were based simply<br/>on the fact that he used so many extreme changes of key in<br/>his modulations (meaning that the two keys are quite far<br/>removed in the circle-of-5ths, or that he often preferred<br/>mediant/submediant relationships rather than perfect-4th/5th<br/>relationships in the root movement), which implies to me a<br/>tendency toward much freer use of all 12 notes, which in<br/>turn implies a tendency towards equalizing the relationships<br/>between those notes.</p><p>I&apos;d agree that Beethoven&apos;s music sounds right in well-temperament.<br/>Perhaps it&apos;s more accurate to suggest that while Beethoven<br/>himself may have always thought in terms of well-temperament<br/>(particularly since he became totally deaf in his 30s and could<br/>not hear any subsequent trends in tuning after that), the new<br/>harmonic techniques he introduced encouraged composers after<br/>him to view the 12 notes of the chromatic scale as needing to<br/>have the equalized relationships of 12-tET.</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;m just wildly speculating again... but hey, it&apos;s<br/>food for thought.  Future researchers may jump on ideas like<br/>this as subjects for dissertations; then we can really get to<br/>the bottom of it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think Beethoven&apos;s pieces are both a reflection of and a<br/>&gt; &gt; stimulus for the further acceptance of 12-tET as a standard<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning.
