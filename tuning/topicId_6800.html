For example, people have discussed performing Landini in<br/>11-limit just intonation (JI) rather than some expected version or<br/>approximation of 3-limit JI; or performing Bach in 7-limit JI, rather<br/>than in an expected well-temperament such as one of Werckmeister&apos;s, or<br/>possibly 31-tone equal temperament (31-tet), etc.</p><p>While part of this debate depends on the specifics of intonational<br/>systems and tastes, a good part depends also on how one sees the<br/>relationship between composer and performer. My purpose here is _not_<br/>to speak for all composers, nor to propose any universal norm for the<br/>composer-performer relationship, since so much of it is culturally<br/>specific. Rather I speak for one viewpoint, a viewpoint affirming both<br/>the importance and beauty of style-appropriate tunings, and the<br/>freedom to experiment with what I call &quot;xeno-interpretations&quot; which<br/>may knowingly or even deliberately apply an unexpected tuning to a<br/>composition in order to achieve a novel effect or to express the<br/>artistic perspective of the interpreter -- which others are free to<br/>adore or abhor.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>1. Disclaimer: Confession of biases old and GNU<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>In expressing my views here, I speak as one whose composing and<br/>performing (the latter mainly for my own edification and recreation)<br/>are oriented mainly to the medieval, Renaissance, and Manneristic<br/>traditions of Europe, and who thus shares some attitudes about the<br/>relationship between composer and performer which may be typical of<br/>these traditions.</p><p>From this viewpoint, I take such matters as the choices of voices or<br/>instruments, changes of instrumentation (for example to contrast the<br/>repetitions within a fixed form such as a rondeau or virelai), subtle<br/>changes of tempo to express a text (recommended by Vicentino), and<br/>improvised ornamentation to be decisions left to the _artful_ judgment<br/>of the performers.</p><p>More specifically, I would regard intonation as a matter generally<br/>left to the performers (ideally informed by period practice), except<br/>in some new pieces I am now composing which call by nature for<br/>Vicentino&apos;s tuning, either 1/4-comma meantone carried to 31 notes per<br/>octave, or 31-tet, as performers may choose. This is not to exclude<br/>xeno-interpretations of these fifthtone pieces, only to say that the<br/>music in this case clearly implies a 31-note system like that of the<br/>first five ranks of Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo. For some of these<br/>pieces, at least, a &quot;reduction&quot; to a 12-note tuning (e.g. meantone)<br/>may be practical simply by ignoring the diesis marks; most other<br/>intonational alternatives would be highly &quot;experimental.&quot;</p><p>In the case of my more &quot;conventional&quot; compositions, however, as with<br/>medieval and Renaissance compositions generally, the question of<br/>intonation is one for the performers to solve, hopefully with some<br/>guidance from period practice and theory. Thus I might generally<br/>recommend that my pieces in medieval styles be realized in 3-limit<br/>(Pythagorean) JI, or some artful approximation for variable-pitch<br/>instruments (including that most perfect instrument, the human voice),<br/>and Renaissance and Manneristic pieces in 5-limit JI or meantone.</p><p>However, as with usual medieval and Renaissance compositions, no<br/>intonation is specified; in some cases, performers may want to try<br/>Mark Lindley&apos;s excellent method for certain early 16th-century lute<br/>pieces, for example, of trying different tunings and seeing which<br/>sounds best.</p><p>Beyond these specifics, my compositions should be open, now and in the<br/>future -- however modest their merits -- to the same liberties,<br/>licenses, and even misguided excesses by performers as those of<br/>Perotin, Adam de la Halle, Guillaume de Machaut, Guillaume Dufay,<br/>Nicola Vicentino, Maddalena Casulana, and Vittoria Aleotti.</p><p>This is, in effect, the musical equivalent of a GNU copyleft:<br/>performer modifications or derivative works are freely and joyfully<br/>permitted, with imitation, quotation, and variation the highest forms<br/>of flattery. This is not to say that tasteless or misguided<br/>interpretations have any value in themselves (except as object<br/>lessons), but that a decision to tolerate them has, because it permits<br/>a performer freedom and choice, which are indeed of great value.</p><p>It may well be that the ethos which I express here may reflect a<br/>certain social context, for example a setting where music is fostered<br/>by a monastic community or by courtly patronage. There may also be a<br/>kind of tacit assumption that audiences will have the means (and<br/>discernment) to distinguish between a composer&apos;s musical text and a<br/>specific performance ot it.</p><p>------------------------------<br/>2. One model: Nicola Vicentino<br/>------------------------------</p><p>In judging the issue of a performer&apos;s liberty (and responsibility)<br/>within the precedents afforded by my own stylistic tradition, I could<br/>quote a range of views. For example, Guillaume de Machaut advises that<br/>one of his polyphonic compositions should be performed &quot;without either<br/>adding to it or taking anything away,&quot; while it is said that Josquin<br/>des Prez responded to a singer&apos;s ostentatious ornamentation of one of<br/>his pieces: &quot;Let the donkey compose his own pieces if he so wishes!&quot;</p><p>At the same time, I might point out that criticisms of excessive or<br/>misplaced embellishments can be found in treatises on how to embellish<br/>with discretion and taste. Such liberties are underscored by a<br/>composer and theorist such as Thomas Morley (1597), who treats the<br/>performer&apos;s liberty to break a note into two or four as one reason<br/>for rules of counterpoint prohibiting forms of similar motion into a<br/>perfect consonance which could become outright parallel motion if such<br/>&quot;breaking&quot; were applied, thus violating the basic Renaissance norm of<br/>avoiding parallel fifths or octaves.</p><p>While Josquin might justly object to a singer more anxious to show off<br/>than to participate in an apt rendition of his work, various<br/>16th-century composers honored this paragon of music by making<br/>arrangements of his pieces, including sacred motets, for instruments<br/>such as the lute. These arrangements are a kind of record of<br/>performance practice, showing idiomatic ornamentation as well as the<br/>artful discretion involved in applying accidentals. Thus the same<br/>cadence may have a minor sixth before an octave (e.g. B2-G3, with C4<br/>as middle C and higher numbers showing higher octaves) made major by<br/>the application of Bb in one arrangement, and G# in another, or the<br/>sixth may be left minor (as happens especially in some German<br/>sources).</p><p>While such interpretations, not to mention the pervasive reworking of<br/>established compositions in such forms as the quodlibet and parody<br/>Mass (i.e. a Mass setting based on a motet or chanson, etc.) and<br/>instrumental variations on a popular theme, are commonplace, I would<br/>like to focus on the liberty of what might be termed outright<br/>xeno-interpretations advocated by a noteworthy composer: Nicola<br/>Vicentino.</p><p>In presenting brief samples of his enharmonic compositions using<br/>fifthtones, Vicentino notes that usual compositions may be improved by<br/>adding semitonal inflections (sharps and flats) or dieses (fifthtone<br/>alterations) at appropriate points. While _musica ficta_ (accidentals<br/>other than Bb, an integral part of the hexachord system along with B)<br/>might often be left unspecified by the composer, the addition of<br/>diesis (i.e. fifthtone) inflections to an ordinary 16th-century pieces<br/>seems to me about as radical a reinterpretation as performing Landini<br/>in 11-limit or Bach in 7-limit.</p><p>At the same time, Vicentino takes the same open and experimental<br/>attitude to his own compositions. Thus he states that some of his<br/>works can be performed either in a pure diatonic manners (without any<br/>accidentals), in a chromatic manner (observing the sharps and flats,<br/>but not the dieses), or in an enharmonic manner (observing all<br/>inflections). Performers might also realize certain works in a &quot;mixed&quot;<br/>manner, observing some inflections of a given kind while disregarding<br/>others.</p><p>At the very least, Vicentino&apos;s example may suggest that people who<br/>explore novel tunings in their own compositions may be prone to<br/>experiment with them in other people&apos;s compositions as well, to good<br/>effect or otherwise (possibly depending in part on who is the judge).</p><p>From my own viewpoint, I would say that adding dieses to a piece by<br/>Arcadelt or Willaert would be tantamount to a kind of &quot;recomposition,&quot;<br/>one which would be most unhappy as a _substitute_ for a likely<br/>interpretation within the original composer&apos;s intended gamut, but<br/>which might be intriguing as a kind of _variation_.</p><p>In contrast, Vicentino&apos;s adaptive 5-limit JI system which he offers as<br/>an alternative tuning for his 36-note-per-octave archicembalo might<br/>make possible an interpretation combining the melodiousness of<br/>meantone and the pure concords of JI. Interestingly, Paul Erlich<br/>proposes the same solution for realizing 5-limit on a keyboard while<br/>minimizing melodic shifts (the disparity being 1/4 syntonic comma or<br/>~5.38 cents with a basic meantone temperament providing pure 5:4 major<br/>thirds.)</p><p>Thus while Vicentino&apos;s proposal to add enharmonic dieses to<br/>conventional compositions involves a kind of xeno-interpretation, his<br/>adaptive 5-limit JI might be seen as a technical refinement<br/>reconciling meantone temperament and more consistently pure concords<br/>without radically redefining the music to which it is applied.</p><p>Many intonational decisions may fall somewhere between these extremes<br/>on a kind of continuum of discretion. Thus deciding _which_<br/>Pythagorean intonation scheme to use for a late ballata of Landini or<br/>a song of Ciconia may be an open question even if one seeks to be as<br/>&quot;period appropriate&quot; as possible: should one use Eb-G#, G-Bb, or<br/>possibly some 15-note or larger scheme to have a choice between active<br/>thirds and sixths for directed cadential resolutions to stable<br/>concords, and &quot;softened&quot; thirds and sixths in prolonged sonorities<br/>elsewhere?</p><p>With whatever historical warrant, possibly from Marchettus of Padua<br/>(1318), some serious groups performing 14th-century Italian music<br/>_are_ adding &quot;microtones&quot;; whether one applauds or decries this<br/>Vicentinan liberty, it adds another possibility to the spectrum of<br/>performances.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>3. In defense of period-appropriate tunings<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>Having read some of the less complimentary opinions expressed here<br/>about what I might term deliberate xeno-interpretations, I would like<br/>to affirm a positive proposition: good performances of pieces in the<br/>period-appropriate tunings for which they are likely designed and in<br/>which they can carry a unique flavor and aura are indeed a necessity<br/>too often neglected.</p><p>Perotin or Machaut in Pythagorean, Lasso or Casulana in meantone or<br/>5-limit, Vicentino in 31-note meantone or 31-tet, Bach in Werckmeister<br/>-- these are high experiences which should set an artistic norm. Let<br/>the variations, parodies, and experimental retunings indeed be heard;<br/>but let also the cardinal theme of a tuning to fit the original<br/>ambience of the music resound with joy and honor.</p><p>Celebrating the beauty of period-appropriate tunings, I would caution<br/>that it may be all too easy to blame a few artists experimenting with<br/>xeno-interpretations for a scarcity of period-appropriate performances<br/>which may be far more due to mainstream intonational inertia.</p><p>To perform Bach on a 12-tet keyboard, no less than to perform Bach in<br/>some adaptive 7-limit scheme, is to offer a period-unlikely reading.<br/>While the 7-limit interpretation may arouse more controversy because<br/>it more obviously sounds &quot;different,&quot; and represents a clearer<br/>deviation from the consonance/dissonance contrasts of the style, a<br/>12-tet interpretation may pose a greater danger of eclipsing a period<br/>reading in Werckmeister or the like.</p><p>In both cases, the remedy is not to prohibit either 7-limit renditions<br/>or performances on a 12-tet keyboard which happens to be at hand, but<br/>to make the beauty of a performance in Werckmeister or some other<br/>unequal well-temperament more widely known.</p><p>One might in fact argue that some xeno-interpretations (7-limit or<br/>otherwise) could actually promote the period-appropriate<br/>well-temperaments by sparking debate on intonation as it relates to<br/>Bach&apos;s treatment of tonality and concord/discord. An obviously<br/>&quot;unusual&quot; rendition may from at least this viewpoint be less<br/>&quot;dangerous&quot; than one quite different from the likely original<br/>realization but too easily confused with it, as in the common<br/>misunderstanding that &quot;Bach invented 12-tet.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, I might be less concerned about some exotic 11-limit<br/>interpretation of Landini than about a 5-limit interpretation based on<br/>the too-popular doctrine that &quot;Pythagorean is just the construct of<br/>some medieval theorists placing rules over musical common sense.&quot; Some<br/>years ago, a scholar commented that although medieval documentation<br/>seems to call for Pythagorean thirds, he had not heard any group use<br/>them in performance, because they would likely be criticized for their<br/>&quot;discordant&quot; intonation! This is the kind of prejudice which can do<br/>far more harm than an obviously &quot;unconventional&quot; xeno-interpretation,<br/>precisely because it is &quot;the conventional wisdom.&quot;</p><p>Here I might add a word of advice as an exponent of style-appropriate<br/>tunings: proponents of xeno-interpretations might be wise to emphasize<br/>that their alternatives are indeed alternatives rather than<br/>replacements for period tunings.</p><p>Above all I would stress that the value of tuning pluralism suggests<br/>an appreciation for the unique qualities and musical virtues of the<br/>period tunings, as opposed to their dismissal as _merely_ reflecting<br/>technical limitations or other constraining factors.</p><p>Just as the best remedy for the excesses of free speech is more free<br/>speech, so the best corrective for xeno-interpretations which one<br/>considers dubious is more interpretations in period-appropriate<br/>tunings.</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>4. The inevitability of interpretation<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>Even if one champions style-appropriateness as a prime intonational<br/>virtue, the ultimate freedom and responsibility of interpretation<br/>remains, however delicately it may sometimes be exercised.</p><p>Thus to perform a 13th-century French motet in Pythagorean is a good<br/>stylistic choice, but still leaves open the question (especially for<br/>voices or other non-fixed-pitch instruments) of what variations might<br/>have taken place.</p><p>To perform the early Dufay in a modified or extended Pythagorean with<br/>at least some major thirds realized as diminished fourths seems an<br/>appropriate solution, and the aura of the altered thirds in this<br/>sonorous environment can indeed be captivating; but some singers may<br/>lean to consistent 5-limit JI, and it may be difficult to say just how<br/>choristers would have tuned Dufay (or Dunstable, the fount of the<br/>&quot;English countenance&quot; which he is said to follow in a contemporary<br/>poem of around 1440).</p><p>Such problems may arise from various stylistic perspectives. For<br/>example, if a 12-note Pythagorean tuning of the kind popular in the<br/>early 15th-century is applied to 14th-century compositions, then some<br/>cadential thirds and sixths will be &quot;softened&quot; -- contrary to the<br/>aesthetics which may have prevailed for most of that century, at least<br/>if we are to trust such theorists as Prosdocimus of Beldemandis or<br/>Ugolino of Orvieto.</p><p>Similarly, one of the organs around 1460 with an innovative meantone<br/>tuning might well have been used to play pieces conceived in the<br/>traditional Pythagorean system.</p><p>Rather than rejecting variation -- whether deliberate or technically<br/>unavoidable or inertial, let us strive to be more aware of the<br/>decisions, compromises, experiments, and concessions to sheer inertia<br/>which we are making.</p><p>In short, the ideal advocated here is one of stylistically informed<br/>choice.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=6816 href="#6816">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/1999 8:24:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Margo for your post, TD 431.18.
