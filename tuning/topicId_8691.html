I swear you have a little &quot;gremlin&quot; tuner standing behind that piano<br/>&gt; and tuning the &quot;E&quot; lower and lower, bit by bit.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how &quot;ultimate&quot; it is, but it&apos;s the best I could come up with<br/>quickly. Clearly, you heard the essential point of the demo. Amazing how<br/>those piano strings can streeeeeeeeeetch, right before your eyes.....er,<br/>ears. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s great you learned how to post stuff like that.  I would also like to<br/>&gt; learn someday... Also, the sound quality is great.  I didn&apos;t realize,<br/>&gt; though,  that people could make sounds through their mouths like that... I<br/>&gt; just assumed music was always made with oscillators (??)</p><p>Boy, have I got some sounds for you! :-)</p><p>For your info, I transferred the initial recording to my Logic Audio<br/>program, then exported it as an AIFF file. My SoundJam program translated it<br/>to mp3. I uploaded it to my web site (not on a page, but just in the files<br/>folder). The URL is just my web site address with the file attached. I now<br/>have QuickTime Pro as well, which will translate to other formats, such as<br/>.wav (suggested by Dan Wolf). I&apos;m pleased to be &quot;off the ground&quot; in this<br/>regard. As with many internet skills, it&apos;s not very hard once you learn how.<br/>LOL</p><p>Thanks for the &quot;celebration,&quot; Joe.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
