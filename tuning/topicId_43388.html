As for &quot;implied errors&quot;, there is no<br/>&gt; &gt;correlation between notation and accurate performance (in at least<br/>&gt; &gt;this specific instance)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i don&apos;t understand. there&apos;s no correlation between ted mook&apos;s<br/>&gt; notation and his performance? maybe i should clarify that<br/>by &quot;implied<br/>&gt; errors&quot; i mean the errors implied if the 72-equal notation were<br/>taken<br/>&gt; literally -- remember that the very idea of such notation was<br/>&gt; abhorrent to some.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***It would seem to me that getting at Patrch through 72 like Mook<br/>does, and then &quot;tweaking it&quot; a bit would be as accurate as just about<br/>any other method of playing notationed Partch.</p><p>Am I incorrect about this, and, if so, is there incontrovertible<br/>evidence about it?  (Like a *recorded test* but I know around here<br/>that&apos;s a big &quot;no-no&quot;...)</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
