I perhaps should mention some interesting<br/>points about Chou and his work (sprinkled with uncited quotes<br/>from the UCSD program notes and Eric Lai&apos;s lecture).</p><p>Chou was born in China into a family that placed equal value<br/>on Chinese and Western cultures.  He received an education as<br/>a civil engineer in China.</p><p>Chou came to America on an architecture scholarship from Yale,<br/>but shifted his major to music and attended New England<br/>Conservatory.</p><p>He moved to New York in 1949, receiving a Masters in Composition<br/>from Columbia in 1954.  Remaining in America, he lives in New York<br/>today.</p><p>It was interesting to me to learn that he knew Partch at U. of<br/>Illinois in Urbana, and even more interesting that he is a good<br/>friend of my own teacher in New York, Elias Tanenabaum.  He also<br/>taught Charles Dodge, another one of my teachers.</p><p>He was a student of Var&egrave;se, in fact apparently Var&egrave;se&apos;s favorite<br/>student, since he was entrusted with much of Var&egrave;se&apos;s legacy and<br/>now serves as Var&egrave;se&apos;s primary musical executor.</p><p>His goal in composition has been to fuse the Chinese tradition<br/>with Western styles.  To a large extent, his compositional<br/>gestures are meant to be a sonic analogy to Chinese calligraphy.<br/>As might be expected of a student of Var&egrave;se, a great deal of<br/>emphasis is placed on the manipulations of register, timbre,<br/>articulation, intensity, tempo, and rhythm.</p><p>That said, here&apos;s a little more elaboration on his use of the<br/>I-Ching in relation to pitch:</p><p>In the late 1950s, Chou developed a compositional system from<br/>the I-Ching which informs all of his later work.  This might<br/>seem to give him an affinity to John Cage, who also used the<br/>I-Ching (but I can&apos;t comment on Cage here because I really<br/>haven&apos;t studied this aspect of *his* work), but Chou&apos;s use of<br/>it is much more systematic and sophisticated.</p><p>He recognizes the I-Ching as a binary system, made up of _yin_<br/>(= 0) and _yang_ (= 1).</p><p>The 8 trigrams form the series:</p><p>000 = 0  earth<br/>001 = 1  mountain<br/>010 = 2  rain<br/>011 = 3  wind<br/>100 = 4  thunder<br/>101 = 5  sun<br/>110 = 6  lake<br/>111 = 7  heaven</p><p>The names also bring in a relation to poetry, which is also<br/>a background aspect of Chou&apos;s compositions.</p><p>So at first these yin/yang were rendered musically as:</p><p>yin = a trichord composed of two consecutive whole-steps<br/>yang = an interval of a minor 3rd.  For example, one yin<br/>could be F-G-A and one yang could be C#-E.</p><p>Musically, the trigrams originally represented conjunct<br/>combinations of the yin and yang musical elements, yielding<br/>scales of 5, 6, or 7 pitch-classes.  For example:</p><p>- the 000 trigram would be F-G-A_A-B-C#_C#-D#-F<br/>- the 001 trigram would be F-G-A_A-B-C#_C#-E<br/>- the 010 trigram would be F-G-A_A-C_C-D-E</p><p>and so on.</p><p>Each hexagram is made of two trigrams, the first one ascending<br/>in pitch, the second descending.  These hexagrams form what Chou<br/>calls &quot;Aggregates&quot;.</p><p>During the first stage of using these, Aggregates I (1960s),<br/>Chou changed the way the system worked, so that yin = a trichord<br/>composed of an ascending whole-tone then semitone, and the<br/>trigrams became *disjunct* (separated by a semitone) combinations<br/>of the yin and yang elements.  For example (&apos; means descending):</p><p>earth-heaven&apos;  = 000/111 = F-G-Ab A-B-C C#-D#-E  F-D C#-A# A-F#<br/>mountain-wind&apos; = 001/011 = F-G-Ab A-B-C C#-E     F-Eb-D C#-A# A-F#</p><p>etc.</p><p>The complete hexagram or aggregate formed scales of 15 pitch-classes,<br/>with some repetitions.</p><p>Later he again changed yin so that it meant simply an interval<br/>of a whole-tone.  He did this so that the Aggregates would produce<br/>a 12-tone series with no repetitions of pitch-classes.  This is<br/>the Aggregates II period of Chou&apos;s work, from 1970 to the present.<br/>Here the first part of the row is outlined by an F augmented<br/>triad ascending, and the second part by a Bb augmented triad<br/>descending.  The pitch-classes following each of these depends<br/>on the yin-yang structure.  For example:</p><p>earth-earth&apos;      = 000/000 = F-G A-B C#-D#  F#-E D-C Bb-Ab<br/>mountain-thunder&apos; = 001/100 = F-G A-B C#-E   F#-D# D-C Bb-Ab</p><p>etc.</p><p>Now for more on his ideas about culture:</p><p>Chou&apos;s preferred term for the blending or &quot;confluence&quot; of<br/>cultures is &quot;re-merger&quot;.  Why he uses this term instead of<br/>just plain &quot;merger&quot; really hit home to me at the very end<br/>of this last speech, when he played a song he recorded in<br/>a remote village in Yunan province.</p><p>I was stunned - because of the distance and (apparent, alleged)<br/>cultural separation - at how closely it resembled a song I&apos;m<br/>familiar with which was recorded in the 1950s in a remote<br/>Bulgarian village.</p><p>When I mentioned this in the Q&amp;A after the talk, Chou related<br/>a similar experience where he and his wife had heard music<br/>in Brittany (France) which was nearly identical to a Yunan song.</p><p>The point: that there are underlying aspects of music (and other<br/>arts, and other domains of life) which show that divergent<br/>instances of it share a common basis - in the case of music, in<br/>intonation, phrasing, contrapuntal technique, relation to the<br/>text, etc.  The divergencies have often been later occurrences,<br/>due to population movement, war, etc.  An so the apparent modern<br/>&quot;merger&quot; of cultures is in many cases really only a &quot;re-merger&quot;,<br/>bringing to light similarities that are not new but were always<br/>there and were merely buried for a long time.</p><p>The multifacted levels on which Chou&apos;s intellect inspire me are<br/>comparable to those of Mahler and Schoneberg.  It&apos;s perhaps an even<br/>stronger feeling for me, not only because I saw him speak live,<br/>but even moreso because I met and talked with him face-to-face.<br/>It makes me begin to understand the kind of fanatical devotion<br/>that Mahler&apos;s disciples (including Schoenberg and his students)<br/>and Schoenberg&apos;s students (especially Berg and Webern) had to *them*.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
