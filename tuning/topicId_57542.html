We&apos;re trying to do something similar to what<br/>John Chowning did with Stria: create a scale based on ratios of Phi<br/>powers instead of on powers of 2, and then apply modulator signals<br/>that are related in frequency by Phi powers to the carrier.</p><p>So far we have closely approached what we want to do by using the FM-<br/>7 software in conjunction with an Ensoniq ASR-10 Sampler.  FM-7 will<br/>allow you to create a number of modulations of the tones you play<br/>from the keyboard.  FM-7 will also allow you to microtune an octave<br/>of tones; it then applies this scale to all octaves.  Unfortunately,<br/>this is not exactly what we want to do.  In order to create a true<br/>Phi-based scale across the whole keyboard, we have to be able to re-<br/>tune each key in all octaves individually, and FM-7 doesn&apos;t seem to<br/>allow that.</p><p>We&apos;ve started to work with the MAX object programming language, and<br/>it appears that MAX may allow us to do both FM synthesis and the key-<br/>by-key microtuning of the whole keyboard, but we&apos;re not sure because<br/>we haven&apos;t done it yet.</p><p>It would be nice to have a synthesizer that would do all of what we<br/>want to do.  According to what we have been able to find out through<br/>our Web research, Yamaha once made a series of keyboard synthesizers<br/>(DX-7II, DX-11, DX-27, SY-77, SY-99) that will do both FM and some<br/>degree of microtuning.  We&apos;re particularly interested in the last 3<br/>synths mentioned because they&apos;re currently available on ebay.<br/>Unfortunately, from the manuals posted on-line at the Yamaha website,<br/>it&apos;s really hard to tell whether we&apos;d be able to do the type of<br/>microtuning we want with these synths.  It looks like the DX-27 won&apos;t<br/>do it, but the SY-77 and SY-99 might.</p><p>Apparently another possibility is to use Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala<br/>program to re-map the keyboard of one of these synths.<br/>Unfortunately, I can&apos;t tell from the Scala website and the Scala help<br/>file whether we can really do it.  The Scala web page lists the DX-27<br/>as a synth to which it can export tuning data, and says in<br/>parentheses &quot;both octave and full keyboard bulk data&quot;.  The reference<br/>to &quot;full keyboard bulk data&quot; sounds like what we want to do, but none<br/>of the Scala documentation actually shows you how to do it.</p><p>To re-map the whole keyboard, we would first have to specify a set of<br/>ratio values or cents values that would give a unique value for each<br/>key on the keyboard.  For the keys below the Middle C key, these<br/>ratios would be much less than 1 (in cents they would be more and<br/>more negative).  Then we would have to specify how each of these<br/>ratios (cents values) were to be mapped to the keyboard (basically,<br/>which keyboard key to start with).  It&apos;s not at all clear from the<br/>Scala documentation how we would do this.  Do we do it with both a<br/>scale file and a keyboard mapping file?  If so, how are the two<br/>linked?</p><p>If anybody could help with any of this, it would be appreciated.<br/>Also, if anyone knows how to get ahold of Manuel Op de Coul or a<br/>Scala expert by e-mail, that might help.</p></div><h3><a id=57559 href="#57559">ðŸ”—</a>Werner Mohrlok &#x3C;wmohrlok@hermode.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2005 8:38:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>For controlling the keys of Midi instruments with<br/>&quot;free frequencies&quot; the best Midi Data format is:<br/>*Midi Single Note Tuning Change Real Time*.<br/>I know only two synths which support this Midi data format:</p><p>1.

In doubt ask Michael Kurz (see above).</p><p>If you want to control a virtual Instrument with an application on<br/>the same computer, you have to connect it with a &quot;Loopback&quot;, for instance<br/>&quot;Midi Yoke&quot;.

In other case:<br/>We possess an own programme for sending tuning messages, but this is not<br/>&quot;for free&quot; as it performs also gliding tuning changes and self-correcting<br/>tuning programs.</p><p>If you would like to get additional informations, please write me<br/>directly.</p><p>Best</p><p>Werner Mohrlok<br/>Hermode Tuning</p><p>&gt; -----Urspr&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>&gt; Von: yamatman [<a href="mailto:yamatman@yahoo.com">mailto:yamatman@yahoo.com</a>]<br/>&gt; Gesendet: Dienstag, 15.
