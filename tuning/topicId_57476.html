Anyway, this Ozan system<br/>I think, if I am remembering this right, did come up as a no-fives<br/>system. The R value for the above fifth is 2.7887, and for Ozan&apos;s<br/>fifth, which is exactly 4000/3993 sharper than a pure fifth, we have<br/>704.987 cents, for an R of 2.7973.

The wolf fifth is 28 steps of 46, not 27, and if<br/>you are brave enough to interpret it in the 21-odd-limit, could be<br/>32/21, which is one of the intervals 46 uses it for.</p><p>The no-fives 13-limit temperament this corresponds to is exactly the<br/>same as in the case of 80; only the 5 mapping differs, and we ignore<br/>that. Does it need a name, I wonder? It is the temperament, regarded<br/>as a 13-limit no-fives temperament, which tempers out 169/168,<br/>352/351, and 364/363. It has an octave period and a fifth generator,<br/>and is supported by 17, 29, 46, 63, 80, 92, 109, 126, 172 and 189. It<br/>can be extended to a complete 13-limit temperament in various ways;<br/>for instance by adding 91/90 to the mix.</p><p>The 80-et version of this MOS has a wolf of 720 cents, which is the<br/>fifth of 5-equal. We pay for that with sharper thirds, less near to<br/>14/11; the 80-et version of a 14/11 third is 420 cents, whereas the<br/>46-et version is 417.3 cents, and a pure 14/11 is 417.4 cents. The<br/>80-et version of 9/7, however, is almost pure, and is much better than<br/>the 46-et version, and this is significant because they appear in the<br/>remote keys instead of 14/11. Margo targeted this for a few of her<br/>thirds in her well-temperament.</p></div>
