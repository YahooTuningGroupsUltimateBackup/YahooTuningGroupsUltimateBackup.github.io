In this<br/>tuning, we have a rounded 0-267-702-969 cents.</p><p>Following Dave&apos;s lead, I might similarly proposse in this type of<br/>musical setting that the 14:18:21:24 might be termed a &quot;supermajor<br/>added sixth chord,&quot; a variation on the usual added sixth chord with a<br/>major third and fifth (the Classic triad) plus major sixth. As this<br/>name suggests, the third and sixth are here &quot;supermajor&quot; from a<br/>meantone or 12n-tET viewpoint, in a tuning of 0-435-702-933 cents.</p><p>In a neo-Gothic setting, these same sonorities are known as &quot;complete<br/>cadential quads,&quot; a term reflecting the fact that they have not only<br/>four voices, but also four unstable intervals which in a standard<br/>resultion all progress to stable ones by means of ideally efficient<br/>stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>To illustrate this, let&apos;s pick a regular temperament outstanding for<br/>these sonorities, and I hope not uncongenial to your tastes, Paul:<br/>22-tET.</p><p>Here are standard 22-tET resolutions of the 14:18:21:24 and<br/>12:14:18:21 approximations on F, using the natural spelling of these<br/>sonorities which results in a neo-Gothic or &quot;Pythagorean&quot; scale where<br/>each regular whole-tone is equal to 4 steps (~218.18 cents), and each<br/>diatonic semitone to 1 step (~54.55 cents):</p><p>            14:18:21:24                  Contractive/Intensive</p><p>     E4 -----   +55 ----- F4                D4  ----- -218 ----- C4<br/>    (218)               (491)              (273)                 (0)<br/>     D4 ------ -218 ----- C4                B3 -----   +55 ----- C4<br/>  (491,273)            (491,0)           (709,436)            (709,709)<br/>     B3 -----   +55 ----- C4                G3  ----- -218 ----- F3<br/>(927,709,436)       (1200,709,709)     (982,709,273)         (709,709,0)<br/>     G3 ------ -218 ----- F3                E3 -----   +55 ----- F3</p><p>   (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)           (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>Here numbers in parentheses show vertical intervals in rounded cents,<br/>while signed numbers show the motion of each voice in ascending or<br/>descending rounded cents. The 9:7 major third is almost pure, and the<br/>7:6 minor third or 12:7 major sixth rather close to pure also; the 3:2<br/>fifth and especially the 7:4 minor seventh are more heavily tempered,<br/>one might say a necessary compromise involved in the heroic effort<br/>needed to produce these quads in a chain of only four fifths or<br/>fourths.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic standpoint, all four resolutions of unstable<br/>two-voice intervals (shown in parentheses beneath the examples) are<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; progressions, involving motion of a whole-tone in<br/>one voice and a semitone in the other. More specifically, we here have<br/>ascending semitones and descending whole-tones, often more conclusion<br/>than the converse arrangement.</p><p>Given the discussions about 22-tET scales and modes, I might note that<br/>this kind of cadence occurs naturally (without accidentals) in what<br/>might be termed the &quot;22-tET Pythagorean Lydian&quot; mode on F, how here in<br/>22-tET steps and rounded cents:</p><p>F      G      A      B    C      D       E    F<br/>0      4      8      12  13      17      21   22<br/>0     218    436     655 709     927    1145 1200<br/>   4      4       4     1     4      4      1<br/>  218    218     218    55   218    218    55</p><p>This &quot;Pythagorean-style&quot; diatonic scale provides all the notes needed<br/>for our cadences from a complete quad to a stable trine (2:3:4) on F<br/>(here F3-C4-F4).</p><p>The example of 22-tET illustrates Dave Keenan&apos;s more general point<br/>than an ideal nomenclature for one musical setting may invite<br/>modification in a different setting.</p><p>Here _regular_ major and minor thirds, the usual versions of these<br/>intervals, have ratios near 9:7 and 7:6, so to call them &quot;supermajor&quot;<br/>or &quot;subminor&quot; might fit a different kind of setting such as meantone<br/>or much 20th-century music in 12-tET, where the usual or at least<br/>&quot;ideal&quot; ratios for these thirds are at or near 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>However, Dave&apos;s terminology might nicely fit Paul&apos;s decatonic tonality<br/>based on stable tetrads of 4:5:6:7, where thirds of around 381.81 and<br/>327.27 cents (from a &quot;Pythagorean&quot; point of view, respectively<br/>augmented seconds and diminished fourths) are treated as the usual<br/>major and minor sizes, in contrast to the &quot;dissonant&quot; ~9:7.</p><p>Let us now return to the optimization problem. In my earlier post, I<br/>counted each category of interval in 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 only<br/>once:</p><p>7:4 or 8:7  = ~231.174 cents (pure at t = 0)<br/>7:6 or 12:7 = ~266.871 cents (pure at t = 1/4, ~233.282 cents)<br/>9:7 or 14:9 = ~435.084 cents (pure at t = 2/7, ~233.583 cents)<br/>3:2 or 4:3  = ~701.955 cents (pure at t = 1/3, ~233.985 cents)</p><p>Using thie approach, I got a minimum at</p><p>150t - 42 = 0<br/>t = 42/150 = 7/25</p><p>Counting 3:2 (or 4:3) and 7:6 (or 12:7) twice each, as suggested, thus<br/>accounting for all six intervals of a 14:18:21:24 or 12:14:18:21<br/>sonority, I curiously got a minimum at:</p><p>200t - 56 = 0<br/>t = 56/200 = 7/25</p><p>If this is correct, then my original result of ~233.536 cents, and<br/>accompanying Scala file of a 31-note tuning based on this generator,<br/>would represent the optimization by the six-interval method also.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 7:35:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Following Dave&apos;s lead, I might similarly proposse in this type of<br/>&gt; musical setting that the 14:18:21:24 might be termed a &quot;supermajor<br/>&gt; added sixth chord,&quot; a variation on the usual added sixth chord with<br/>a<br/>&gt; major third and fifth (the Classic triad) plus major sixth.
