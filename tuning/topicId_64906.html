Who cares?</p><p>The point is if someone is describing one perception that can be shown to differ from a<br/>different perception then we should all work together to come up with a name or way to<br/>describe the two so we can communicate well.</p><p>On the other hand, if we are debating whether a term can apply or not to a single<br/>perception, but it isn&apos;t helping us describe the difference of the perception from other<br/>perceptions, then GIVE IT UP.  What&apos;s the point?</p><p>Put simply: if two parts are one two notes and then come to a unison, how is it perceived?<br/>I can think of a lot of possibilities:  one where we still hear them as distinct, one in which<br/>they fuse, and a whole range of a mix in between.  We can describe what factors will affect<br/>where on this line the perception results, but we can&apos;t deny that the same sounds may be<br/>perceived differently on this same line from person to person or even from moment to<br/>moment or between each time listening.  So it is useful to describe this line between<br/>fusing and distinction between two notes of a unison.  And it is useful to discuss the<br/>factors that push it one way or another.  I doubt anybody would deny the existence of this<br/>range of perception.  So how about discussing what factors lead to what perception, and<br/>then when we have an idea what we&apos;re talking about, we can apply names to things for the<br/>sake of communication.  Instead, it appears people are wrapped up in arguing about the<br/>names before they&apos;ve clarified the ideas.  We could be working together to find what we&apos;re<br/>descibing in common, and then helping each other to find the best way to communicate<br/>about it.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=64940 href="#64940">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2006 8:01:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron,</p><p>Good to see you back here again.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t want to repeat myself, but everyone&apos;s arguing<br/>&gt; about terminolgy with the whole zero thing.
