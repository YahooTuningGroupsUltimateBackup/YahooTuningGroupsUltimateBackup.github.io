I really look forward to<br/>hearing some of your work on your new instruments -- you know that I really<br/>like the unusual and creative electroacoustic instruments that you have<br/>invented.</p><p>Yes, maybe some time I will be able to come up to your area for a couple<br/>days and jam. Might be a couple years but it&apos;s at least possible now. I&apos;ve<br/>been in internal political exile for ten years with heavy restrictions<br/>against my right to travel, but just recently its been normalized and I am<br/>now permitted to travel freely.</p><p>I have another piece to share. It&apos;s done most all in Reaktor, which I tuned<br/>to 88 cent equal temperament using the Li&apos;l Miss&apos; Scale Oven. Not that it<br/>matters, it is experimental and the scale is largely irrelevant unless you<br/>listen pretty closely.</p><p>Here is an illustration of the piece:</p><p><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/tunes/InsectoidsEatingNepenthe.jpg">http://www.nonoctave.com/tunes/InsectoidsEatingNepenthe.jpg</a></p><p>And the piece itself may be downloaded here:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/6/xjscottmusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/6/xjscottmusic.htm</a></p><p>It is titled &quot;Nepenthe of Xamphid Olixinstuf&quot;. It depicts two opinionated<br/>insectoids debating philosophy while sharing an intoxicating dessert.<br/>Special thanks to Andrew Heathwaite for clarifying what exactly it was that<br/>the insectoids were doing in this piece!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
