Consider a C-E-G chord: I will tend to bring the E down<br/>by 14 cents and the G up by 2 cents, to achieve JI ratios.  This would<br/>be the tuning actually achieved when the foot-pedal is in some position<br/>(center?).  Now suppose the foot pedal is moved away from its consonant<br/>spot: which way does the tuning move?  A chord tuned consonantly has<br/>&quot;pain&quot; at a minimum, and moving any interval in either direction tends<br/>toward dissonance.</p><p>If the consonant solution is represented by the foot-pedal halfway down,<br/>then it&apos;s easy to imagine that moving it one way will produce the<br/>opposite result to moving it the other way; that&apos;s fine.  But: we have<br/>a lot of intervals in the chord (6 if 4 notes, 10 if 5 notes, etc.),<br/>and they _all_ have to be modified as a result of a single input from<br/>the foot-pedal.  How do we pick which notes move up and which down, as<br/>a result of moving the pedal down?  Even for a triad, the C-E-G above,<br/>this doesn&apos;t seem clear to me.</p><p>Even the question of a consistent tuning with intervals at maximum<br/>dissonance doesn&apos;t have an actual solution, in the general case, that<br/>makes _all_ the intervals of a chord maximally dissonant, does it?</p><p>Am I being clear?  Am I missing something?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
