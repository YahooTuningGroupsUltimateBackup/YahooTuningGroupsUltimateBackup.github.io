My name is David, and I am new in this list. I am not an expert in<br/>tuning theory, but I have some idea about it and try to put it in practice<br/>when I play the violin and when I work with choirs.</p><p>To my mind, neither Just Intonation nor Eq Temp are the only solution. Every<br/>music needs a different tuning.</p><p>A Palestrina vocal work, for example, sounds much better with just<br/>intonation, because of its harmonic clarity and its diatonic construction.<br/>But in19th Century works we can often find accords of dim. 7th (C#-E-G-Bb)<br/>that play a very important role in the harmony because of their ambiguity,<br/>and this polivalence is lost with just intonation.</p><p>A tuning is neither good, nor bad. It can only be more or less adequated to<br/>certain kinds of music. Well, that&apos;s my oppinion.</p><p>P.S: Please, excuse my english.</p></div><h3>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/1999 7:13:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Pagano:]<br/>&gt; Temperments are yesterdays chicken salad.</p><p>Ha!  that&apos;s a good one, Pat!</p><p>Temperaments are fun to play around with.</p><p>JI is fun to play around *in*.</p><p>(who says you can&apos;t use both?)</p><p>-Monzo</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/1999 11:37:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; But I personally find the idea that &apos;pure&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning = a &apos;purer&apos; any*thing else to be offensive in the<br/>&gt; &gt; presumptuous propagandizing extreme.<br/>&gt; You already know that Just Intonation is pure tuning and that Eq Temp is a<br/>&gt; compromise.</p><p>   What Dan may not be aware of is that many people use &quot;pure&quot; as a synonym<br/>for &quot;just [intonation]&quot;.  That in the sense that if you were to look up &quot;pure&quot;<br/>in a sufficiently unabridged dictionary, it would appear as an official<br/>discipline-specific defintion.</p><p>   I personally don&apos;t think that &quot;pure&quot; should be used as anything other than<br/>a general-purpose adjective.  To me it&apos;s judgemental enough a word that it<br/>could lead to misunderstandings of this nature.  To use a more extreme<br/>example to illustrate the point, I wouldn&apos;t recommend &quot;borrowing&quot; into<br/>tuning-specific terminology, words like &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;boring&quot;.</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/1999 7:54:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In English, we have the luxury of having the word _just_ in addition to<br/>_pure_; although the word _just_ has powerful extra-musical associations of<br/>their own, they are less controversial than those associated with _pure_.<br/>In German, the only established term is _Rein_, meaning pure, or clean.<br/>Unfortunately, German history gives this term a particularly ugly cast, one<br/>which is unescapable in the writings of the theorist Martin Vogel, which<br/>often have a nationalist tinge.</p><p>I have had a standing argument with Alvin Lucier over his use of the term<br/>&apos;pure wave&apos; instead of &apos;sine wave&apos;.  Lucier (who famously said, in an<br/>interview with Robert Ashley: &quot;I llllike my mmmmmusic ccccclear, llllike<br/>ggggin&quot;)likes to make the association between the purity of the sine waves<br/>and a neo-classical clarity that he is seeking in his music; I find the<br/>associations of the term &apos;pure&apos; to be distracting.</p></div>
