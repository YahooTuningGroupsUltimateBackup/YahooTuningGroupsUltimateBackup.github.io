Briefly, Carl Sauter<br/>Pianos is the oldest continuous production piano company in the world,<br/>located in Germany in the same town since 1819.  It is a small but very<br/>high<br/>quality, innovative company which builds the most beautiful hand-crafted<br/>pianos I personally have ever seen or played, and we import their<br/>traditional<br/>as well as a line of designer pianos.</p><p>Early this week, at the Piano Technicians Guild convention in Washington<br/>D.C.<br/>I was introduced for the first time to an acoustic piano which we<br/>persuaded<br/>Ulrich Sauter (the sixth generation Sauter to run the company) to bring<br/>from<br/>Germany to the show mainly as a &quot;novelty&quot; to get the piano technicians<br/>into<br/>the booth to see the other pianos in our line, and to generate<br/>conversation<br/>Germany to the show mainly as a &quot;novelty&quot; to get the piano technicians<br/>into<br/>the booth to see the other pianos in our line, and to generate<br/>conversation<br/>about Sauter.  Little did I know what we had on our hands.  It turns out<br/>that<br/>Ulrich&apos;s father was contacted in the 1950s by a microtonal composer named<br/>Julian Carillo (&lt;A<br/>HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.tol.itesm.mx/~esolisw/julian.html">http://www.tol.itesm.mx/~esolisw/julian.html</a>&quot;&gt;Julian<br/>Carrillo and the Thirteenth Sound&lt;/A&gt;) to build a 96 key acoustic piano<br/>built<br/>around the 16 tone system.  Carrillo had been looking for a piano<br/>manufacturer who would build him one of these pianos and after being<br/>&quot;politely&quot; turned down by every company (Steinway, Baldwin , etc.) he<br/>found<br/>Sauter enthusiastic to build it.  About 15 of the &quot;metamorphser&quot; pianos<br/>were<br/>built and made their way to Mexico and to various conservatories around<br/>the<br/>world.  They fell into obscurity until recently when Sauter was contacted<br/>by<br/>the Paris Conservatory to build two of these pianos for them.  After quite<br/>a<br/>bit of research, Sauter was able to find in their archives the original<br/>plans, sketches, etc., and therefore took on the commission.  Since then,<br/>orders have been coming out of the &quot;woodwork&quot; from different parts of the<br/>world, mostly Europe, and Sauter has filled another 7 orders.</p><p>The reason that I am writing to you is to convey the unanticipated<br/>enthusiasm<br/>I encountered from Piano Technicians at this convention towards this<br/>&quot;micortone&quot; piano which has 96 keys but only covers a one octave range of<br/>the<br/>conventional piano, especially those tech&apos;s associated with Universities<br/>and<br/>Conservatories.  We will most likely come away with several serious<br/>commissions to build more which will be ending up in the United States.</p><p>I really don&apos;t know where this will lead to; I&apos;m still trying to sort it<br/>out<br/>myself, and I found your website while trying to find out more about<br/>microtonal music which I&apos;ve had no experience with until seeing this<br/>piano.<br/>I don&apos;t know if any of this interests you, but I want to make myself<br/>available for any information that you may wish to know and which I can<br/>supply you.  I will have the piano in the U.S. for a while.  It is<br/>currently<br/>still in Washington D.C. for the convention and we will be bringing it to<br/>our<br/>distribution headquarters in Melbourne, Florida this coming Monday.<br/>Sauter<br/>is here from Germany and will be in Florida next week from Monday -<br/>Wednesday.  In the meantime, I&apos;m going to find out more about this<br/>microtonal<br/>music because I am fascinated by it, and it seems to me that Sauter and we<br/>have something really special, not just a novelty after all.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>John Ryan<br/>Europianos (a division of Unique Pianos)<br/>Import and Distribution of Fine Quality Hand Crafted Pianos</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
