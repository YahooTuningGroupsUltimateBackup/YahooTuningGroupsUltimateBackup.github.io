I have actually found the whole dialogue<br/>fascinating, although I&apos;ve only understood about 50-75% of it.  I wish I<br/>could grasp it a bit more, but it really is something... and I wanted to<br/>thank both of them for stopping a bit with the dialogue to help me get a<br/>bit &quot;up to speed.&quot;  By the way... I hope Jason&apos;s completed paper could<br/>be eventually &quot;on line&quot; as Paul&apos;s 22-tET paper is...  Jason, is this a<br/>paper or book???</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>___________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
