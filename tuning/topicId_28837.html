The 85 cent interval can<br/>then be associated with 21:20 (84.47 cents) and the 70 cent interval with<br/>25:24 (70.67 cents).  The 115 cents has to be the (geometric) mean of<br/>15:14 and 16:15 or the square root of 8:7 (115.59 cents).</p><p>The septimal kleisma is tempered out, but that&apos;s the only approximation<br/>required.  The fifth is 25/24*(8/7)^2*(21/20)*2.
