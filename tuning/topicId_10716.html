Thanks!!</p><p>The shakuhachi has four basic pitches corresponding to its finger holes: D,<br/>F, G, and A in the most common length. Longer shakuhachi, which are used<br/>for different repertories, will, of course, produce the same pitches<br/>transposed down. Many other pitches are available through half-holing,<br/>varying pressure, and changing the angle of the air stream. In fact, this<br/>extreme variability is one of the great strengths (and difficulties) of the<br/>instrument.</p><p>The traditional scale for shakuhachi is the &quot;in&quot; mode, usually given as D,<br/>Eb, G, A, C, D in ascending form, D, Bb, A, G, Eb, D in descending form.<br/>However, the actual tuning of these pitches is highly variable, and players<br/>will vary not only from piece to piece but within the same piece or even<br/>the same note. The shakuhachi player I have worked with refers to<br/>variations in &quot;darkness&quot; (basically flatness) of the tones, especially Eb<br/>and Bb. &quot;Darker&quot; versions of these pitches (semitones around 70 to 90<br/>cents) are appropriate for the most meditative pieces.</p><p>Though traditional shakuhachi repertory is mostly very contemplative, many<br/>pieces use larger semitones (100 cents or above) when the piece isn&apos;t so<br/>introverted. Shakuhachi players are used to expressive variations in these<br/>tunings since their traditional repertory today is mostly solo. However, in<br/>jiuta or modern ensembles, they often play with kotos, in which case, of<br/>course, they will tune to whatever the koto is tuned to, though not without<br/>occasional expressive inflections when warranted.</p><p>Let us know the results of your tests.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
