In multitone FM, there is an interaction between<br/>the several modulating frequencies, creating additional sidebands<br/>than is apparent by treating each tone individually. The mathematics<br/>for multitone FM can get quite complicated and will not be reproduced<br/>here&quot; [footnote of Giacoletto, &quot;Generalized Theory of Multitone AM<br/>and FM&quot;, Proc IRE July 1947].</p><p>A major difference between the spectra of single-tone and multitone<br/>FM is that while in the former the sideband distribution is<br/>symmetrical around the carrier, in the latter it need not be. While<br/>an absolute rule is difficult to formulate, because of the complexity<br/>of the situation, it has generally been found that symmetrical<br/>modulating waveshapes create symmetrical spectra while unsymmetrical<br/>modulating waveshapes create unsymmetrical spectra.</p><p>In multitone, as in single-tone FM, the total energy is constant<br/>regardless of the degree of modulation. Hence, in multitone FM, as<br/>the number of sidebands is increased the carrier component is<br/>decreased.&gt;&gt;</p><p>J Gill notes:<br/>The text above is describing a rule of thumb applying to_periodic,<br/>repeated_unsymmetrical modulating waveshapes creating unsymmetrical<br/>frequency modulated spectra. The case of a number of discrete steps<br/>approaching a (stepped) &quot;ramp-like&quot; increase (or decrease) in pitch,<br/>in a manner analogous to the considerations of the Fourier integral<br/>(for single transient events) as opposed to the Fourier transform<br/>(for steady-state periodic spectra), carries with it the added<br/>spectral complexity of the length as well as shape of it&apos;s amplitude<br/>envelope (aka &quot;time-domain window&quot;) of the - frequency modulating -<br/>function of time, itself, which resultes in additional (sin f)/f<br/>continuous spectral energy surrounding each of the individual<br/>spectral components of the - frequency modulating - spectra, as a<br/>result of the (effective) amplitude modulation of the - frequency<br/>modulating - function. Simple, eh?...</p><p>It_may_be reasonable to speculate that: a (either increasing or<br/>decreasing) &quot;ramp&quot; - frequency modulating - function, being an even<br/>(non-symmetric around t=0) function of time, and (in the periodic<br/>repeating case) consisting of even (as well as odd) harmonics (of the<br/>fundamental frequency of the - frequency modulating - waveform) which<br/>result in asymmetrical time domain waveforms, would (as a non-<br/>symmetrical modulating_transient_waveform likely result in a non-<br/>symmetrical result frequency-modulated (FM) spectrum.</p><p>Care must be taken, however, to resist the temptation to think of<br/>such &quot;linear-swept-frequency&quot; (or geometric-swept-frequency, if you<br/>will) in what would seem to be the &quot;intuitive&quot; speculation that the<br/>resultant spectral energy actually exists for a time at each<br/>small &quot;step&quot; along the way of such a &quot;swept-frequency&quot; carrier<br/>(frequency modulated higher frequency) in the course of occurance of<br/>such an &quot;arpeggio&quot;... Paradoxically, FM and PM confound our sense of<br/>(spectral) intuition, best put by Engelson below:</p><p>&lt;&lt; We shall not go through the derivation of the network response<br/>leading to the remarkable fact that the total output of a narrowband<br/>filter with an FM input has energy only at discrete frequencies<br/>[footnote Harvey, et al, &quot;The Component Theory of Calculating Radio<br/>Spectra with Special Reference to FM&quot; Proc IRE June 1951]. While the<br/>input [the - frequency modulating - function, J Gill] consists of a<br/>time-variable signal going through all the frequencies between F - dF<br/>and F + dF the output of a narrowband filter, consisting of the<br/>combined transient and steady-state response [of the narrowband<br/>filter through which a frequency modulated signal is passed, J Gill]<br/>and averaged over one FM cycle of interval T [T=time period of one<br/>cycle of a_repeated_modulating waveform, J Gill], contains no energy<br/>except at the frequencies indicated by accepted FM theory.</p><p>...it is not our intention to resolve the question of whether the<br/>spectral components are a part of the signal or are generated by the<br/>circuit. The important thing to remember is that real, physically<br/>realizable, linear, time-invariant circuits behave as if spectral<br/>components exist, and this is what we wish the spectrum analyzer to<br/>show.&gt;&gt;</p><p>J Gill:<br/>This stuff really makes one wonder whether the spectral components of<br/>even such a frequency modulated_sine wave_(ie geometric arpeggio) are<br/>determinable by man or machine in a manner which readily comports<br/>with our (necessarily) simplistic descriptions of a single, &quot;average<br/>pitch&quot; model, when , in fact, the spectral &quot;forest&quot; is_dense_and<br/>overlapping (as opposed to being made up of easily separable spectral<br/>lines. It is interesting that the mathematics appear to imply the<br/>existence of some kind of &quot;narrowband&quot; (hence, slow to respond to a<br/>high level of accuracy) filter occuring_somewhere_in the &quot;signal-<br/>brain&quot; chain (ie spectrum analyzer performing a Fourier integral) as<br/>a requisite for the characterization of the relative energies of the<br/>spectral components of the frequency-modulated (FM) sinusoidal wave<br/>in question. Whether our sense of hearing is able to transcend such<br/>limitations as they exist for other physical systems is debatable.<br/>A 1 HZ bandwidth, as Paul tentatively appears to posit, may, indeed<br/>(save for possible Wavelet magic) require Q/PI cycles to meaningfully<br/>resolve (where Q = Fcenter/Bandwidth of a second order bandpass<br/>element).</p><p>Noting that the average time for pitch recognition for individual<br/>tones (Olson, &quot;Music, Physics, and Engineering&quot;) remains roughly<br/>constant at about 13 milliseconds (which constitutes about 3 or more<br/>cycles of the pitch at the lower frequencies of hearing, and only<br/>_increases_in &quot;necessary cycles&quot; as pitch is increased upward<br/>throughout the audio bandwidth), it seems (perhaps) possible that<br/>arpeggios of up to about 77 notes/second could (potentially) be<br/>resolved by our &quot;organic&quot; apparatus.

I would like to point out here that an<br/>increase in the rate of a &quot;geometric arpeggio&quot;, which in turn<br/>increases the rise-time of the &quot;ramp&quot; - frequency modulating -<br/>function, appears to actually_decrease_the &quot;FM modulation index&quot;<br/>(being a decrease of the denominator of the ratio).</p><p>Only an increase in the resultant_deviation_(vibrato, or geometric<br/>scale factor) of the_modulated_pitch would appear to increase the &quot;FM<br/>modulation index&quot; (being an increase in the denominator of the<br/>ratio), thus spreading the constant energy of the FM modulated pitch<br/>out over upper and lower (possibly unsymmetrically distributed)<br/>sideband pairs determined by the Bessel functions which describe FM.</p><p>The case of chords consisting of simultaneously sounded sine waves<br/>which Paul has (appeared) to indicate in his post #29677 seems to me<br/>to be rather different, and, while not involving energy at harmonics<br/>of the sinusoidal components of a multi-tone chord, still may<br/>(perhaps)involve human &quot;spectral expectations&quot; (ie, of harmonics of<br/>one of the chords sinusoidal components) of a certain pitch being<br/>present, due to the simultaneous presence of other pitches). How<br/>such &quot;spectral expectations&quot; (if they exist) would inter-relate with<br/>the process of resolving a pitch to a given accuracy level seems<br/>unclear, but possibly not without significance in the process.</p><p>Further, if &quot;wavelet&quot; transforms really are (and I believe they are)<br/>able to resolve arbitrarily narrow bandwidths when processing a<br/>_single cycle_of the spectral component to be analyzed (as opposed to<br/>multiple cycles, as in Laplace transform variants Fourier integral,<br/>DFT, FFT, Z transforms, and numerous other frequency domain<br/>transforms developed prior to wavelet theory), we here have<br/>an &quot;inorganic&quot; example of a process which may provide clues as to the<br/>possibility of &quot;organic&quot; pitch perception mechanisms equalling their<br/>impressive performance in practice.
