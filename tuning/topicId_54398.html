Just not here.)</p><p>I guess what I&apos;m going for in a score that has 5 or 7 is something that&apos;s transparent<br/>enough, simple enough (I don&apos;t want people reading it to say hey, this is a complicated<br/>tuning, because it ain&apos;t), but just alien enough for you to pause and think, ooh man,<br/>these ain&apos;t your grandma&apos;s CGDAE.  On the other hand, why should five notes per octave<br/>require five different sagittal accidentals, as in the &quot;preferred&quot; notation?</p><p>The 7 &quot;white key&quot; representation of 7tet is great except that it looks normal.  Perhaps<br/>some wacko modified treble clef would be enough in this case.</p><p>&gt; So what&apos;s wrong with FCGDAE as a chain of fifths for 7-tET. How will<br/>&gt; changing to different letters help?</p><p>Only to help the disorientation, which maybe I&apos;m aiming for too much of, we&apos;ll see.</p><p>&gt; What is &quot;it&quot; here. What made it more difficult to comprehend? (a)<br/>&gt; using the &quot;preferably&quot; notations (which you certainly don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; do) or (b) using conventional nominals and staff positions.</p><p>The use of subsets of larger ETs is mainly what I am questioning.</p><p>&gt; Are you saying you don&apos;t even want to notate 6-ET as a subset of 12-<br/>&gt; ET?</p><p>Ouch!  Tough call.  Maybe I&apos;m okay with it because it only needs one or two accidentals.</p><p>&gt; But one way to make the multiples of say 5-ET correspond, is to<br/>&gt; derive them all as subsets of a common superset. Which is exactly<br/>&gt; what happens with 5, 10 and 25 being derived as subsets of 50<br/>&gt; (meantone). Unfortunately 15, 20 and 30 are not subsets of 50, but<br/>&gt; subsets of 60 (which is a multiple of 12).</p><p>I see.  But would it not be better if everything but 25 were derived from 60?  Is it not<br/>better for at least 10, 15, and 20 to agree on how to represent 5? Or are there other<br/>things to consider...</p><p>&gt; But I understand that what you want to do is define the nominals not<br/>&gt; as approximations to any particular ratio, or linear temperament<br/>&gt; generator, but to the steps of the ET itself (this is equivalent to<br/>&gt; the idea we discussed in the &quot;Native nominals ...&quot; thread for<br/>&gt; notating linear temps with more than 5 periods per octave, which we<br/>&gt; could drop back to &quot;5 or more&quot;).</p><p>I realize that mentioning all this right now is rather silly since the brains &apos;round here just<br/>started working on it, albeit on LTs primarily.  I don&apos;t know if this means that instead of<br/>being held up to JI, ETs will be held up to &quot;optimal generators&quot; for assorted prime-limit<br/>systems.  It makes more sense for ETs to be noted for what they are.</p><p>&gt; No, I don&apos;t believe they are so tied to a series of near-enough-<br/>&gt; fifths that a mess would result, but this is as yet largely<br/>&gt; untested.

Negative flag-<br/>&gt; values are allowed if you&apos;re desperate, but not negative values for<br/>&gt; whole symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So you could choose to notate the actual step size as an<br/>accidental: in<br/>&gt; &gt; the case of 28-ET this is close to 41/40 (42.9 cents).

Its constant meaning across all tunings<br/>&gt; is 32;33 (the 11-diesis). Remember Apollo-11. That is the<br/>difference<br/>&gt; between the best approximation to the interval 8:11 and the best<br/>&gt; approximation to 3:4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even though any particular user may not be concerned about ratio<br/>&gt; approximations at all, we ask that these still be respected. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; the glue that holds the whole system together, across all tunings.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>&gt; As it turns out, for notating 28-ET while using the 7-ET fifth as<br/>&gt; the notational fifth, the arrow (left and right barbs) is an<br/>&gt; excellent choice for notating 1deg28. Since it _is_ the difference<br/>&gt; between the best approximation to the interval 8:11 and the best<br/>&gt; approximation to 3:4 in this temperament.</p><p>Until you proceed to 2 degrees:</p><p>&gt; A symbol for 2 degrees is harder. We&apos;d like a double-shaft symbol<br/>&gt; for this, to take the place of the apotome symbol (double-shaft<br/>&gt; arrow) since the apotome vanishes with this fifth size.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have my spreadsheet set up to check these against ETs<br/>&gt; because normally we can stop at the apotome.</p><p>Because the apotome vanishes in 28-ET and double-shaft symbols are<br/>defined as apotome-complements), it would be a bit of a problem to<br/>figure out how to use double-shaft symbols for 28-ET.

But then there&apos;s the problem of what to use for<br/>3 degrees (yikes!).</p><p>If we look at 21-ET, which has larger steps than 28, we find that we<br/>already came up with this symbol sequence (with all single-shaft<br/>symbols):</p><p>21:  |)  |\  with naturals F C G D A E B</p><p>These same symbols are also valid for 28-ET, and they can be<br/>logically extended to 3 degrees thus:</p><p>28:  |)  |\  |\)  with naturals F C G D A E B</p><p>This keeps it simple and thus easy to remember.</p><p>Now we already have this for 14-ET:<br/>14:  |)  with naturals F C G D A E B<br/>but we might want to change it to this (which is also valid) to make<br/>it compatible with the 28-ET notation:</p><p>14:  |\  with naturals F C G D A E B</p><p>Jacob and Herman, it&apos;s good that you&apos;re bringing up these questions<br/>now, because you&apos;re more closely involved with the ins and outs of<br/>these divisions than either Dave or myself.
