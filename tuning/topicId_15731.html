The number of spectral lines is always 1/2 of the<br/>selected FFT size.  Thus a 1024 point FFT produces 512 output<br/>spectral lines.</p><p>The frequency resolution of each spectral line is equal to the<br/>Sampling Rate divided by the FFT size.  For instance, if the FFT size<br/>is 1024 and the Sampling Rate is 8192, the resolution of each<br/>spectral line will be:</p><p> 8192 / 1024 = 8 Hz.</p><p>Linear Averaging</p><p>Linear - this method is a straight linear average of the spectra over<br/>time.  Each spectra block contributes equally to the average.  This<br/>type of averaging is also known as &quot;stable averaging&quot;.</p><p>Averaging Block Size: 1</p><p>The averaging block size determines how many spectra blocks are<br/>averaged together to compute a moving average.  For instance, if the<br/>averaging block size is set to 4, the spectrum currently displayed is<br/>an moving average of the previous 4 traces.</p><p>Let me know how your results differ.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky</p></div>
