The 12tET augmented triad might have less tonalness (more harmonic<br/>entropy), but with most timbres the lower roughness more than compensates.<br/>Your perception of consonance may weigh these factors differently than mine,<br/>but I&apos;ll claim that mine is more relevant in the context of, say, country<br/>music (since we&apos;re talking about Bob Lee and his steel guitar . . .) Also, I<br/>daresay I think you&apos;ve trained yourself to like JI and dislike temperament.</p></div>
