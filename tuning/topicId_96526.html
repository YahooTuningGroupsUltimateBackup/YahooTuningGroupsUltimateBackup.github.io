Hi, Petr.  Welcome to my life!  &quot;No 3&apos;s&quot; is my middle name.  Okay, granted--some of my favorite temperaments aren&apos;t &quot;non-3&quot; but just &quot;really BAD 3&quot;, but yes, I am very much interested in these approaches.  I&apos;d love to hear some of your favorites, as I&apos;m compiling a list of the best subgroup temperaments that I can find based on the following triads (not all of which are non-3):</p><p>5:6:7<br/>6:7:9<br/>7:8:9<br/>4:5:7<br/>4:6:7<br/>9:11:15<br/>8:10:11<br/>7:9:11<br/>6:9:11<br/>18:22:27<br/>9:11:13<br/>10:13:15<br/>8:10:13</p><p>I think all of these triads could, to a greater or lesser extent, by used as analogs to the familiar 4:5:6 as bases for tonal music.  Right now I&apos;m looking for all the lowest-complexity lowest-error temperaments for each of these and indexing EDOs which do a good job with them.  I&apos;ll post my own results when I&apos;ve concluded the survey, but in the meantime I&apos;d welcome suggestions.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2011 10:19:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr,</p><p>You might find that 11-equal is to 4:7:9:11 what 12-equal is to 4:5:6.<br/>I&apos;ve been playing with that a lot lately.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>2011/2/26 Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi there tuners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A while ago, I was thinking of various prime restrictions in temperaments<br/>&gt; and I found something interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s the Bohlen-Pierce temperament whose approximations lack the number 2<br/>&gt; and some of the &quot;hyper-BP&quot; variants may happily include virtually any other<br/>&gt; prime while still excluding 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, there are temperaments of Margo Schulter or Hudson Lacerda (or whoever<br/>&gt; else was involved at that time) whose approximations lack the number 5 but<br/>&gt; happily include virtually any prime above or below that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now my question is: Has it been really just me so far who has tried to make<br/>&gt; music in temperaments excluding the number 3 from their approximations?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2011 12:43:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Now my question is: Has it been really just me so far who has tried to make<br/>&gt; music in temperaments excluding the number 3 from their approximations?</p><p>I doubt it. But when you speak of such things, note that there is a difference between 9s but no 3s, and no 3s at all. The former has 7-9-11 and 9-11-13 to play with. With the latter, I wonder if you could tell us what your favorite chords are?</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2011 2:42:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; Now my question is: Has it been really just me so far who has tried to<br/>&gt; make<br/>&gt; music in temperaments excluding the number 3 from their approximations?</p><p>&gt; LOL.

I never thought I would one day link to<br/>all of them in a single message; but Nevertheless, here they are:<br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/13LimitSpectrum.mp3">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/13LimitSpectrum.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/13limitImpro.mp3">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/13limitImpro.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/2200_Over_2197_Temperament.mp3">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/2200_Over_2197_Temperament.mp3</a></p><p>The first temperament used is a 2D system with a generator of (32/5)^(1/9). This means there&apos;s an &quot;unintended&quot; fifth of ~714 cents but I&apos;ve used it anyway (mainly in the introduction). My primary target approximation was 4:5:7:13.</p><p>The second one is also a 2D tuning with a generator equal to 130^(1/13) where the primary approximation was 8:10:11:13.</p><p>The third one is a 3D tuning whose primary approximation is also 8:10:11:13 and which I&apos;m describing here:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/86863">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/86863</a></p><p>Now onto your suggestions.</p><p>&gt; 5:6:7</p><p>Add 10 to that and you&apos;re on a way to myna.</p><p>&gt; 6:7:9</p><p>If you add 8, this may lead to a &quot;fiveless&quot; pentatonic like 12:14:16:18:21:24. Another possibility is to temper out 1029/1024 or 64/63 or 17496/16807 or 65536/64827 or, in a very good case, 118098/117649.<br/>The untempered non-octave chains inside the plain 6:7:9 are something which I still have to examine more yet.</p><p>&gt; 7:8:9</p><p>Add 6 and it&apos;s the same for this.</p><p>&gt; 4:5:7</p><p>The most obvious example is to temper out 3136/3125 -- i.e. 2 steps for 5/4, 5 steps for 7/4. This actually makes it possible to approximate 4:5:7:11 using 9 steps to substitute 11/4.</p><p>&gt; 4:6:7</p><p>This offers the same possibilities as 6:7:9 since 9/6 = 6/4. This is true not only for the temperaments with octaves but for the untempered non-octave chains as well.</p><p>&gt; 9:11:15</p><p>Not explored so far.</p><p>&gt; 8:10:11</p><p>Add 16 and you get a possibility of some sort of &quot;fifthless orwell&quot;.</p><p>&gt; 7:9:11<br/>&gt; 6:9:11</p><p>Again, not explored too much so far.</p><p>&gt; 18:22:27</p><p>The most obvious choice is to temper out 243/242.</p><p>&gt; 9:11:13<br/>&gt; 10:13:15</p><p>Maybe you will find more of a point in these than I would.</p><p>&gt; 8:10:13</p><p>Add 16 and you soon get possible 13-limit mappings for the temperaments I used in the recordings.</p><p>&gt; I think all of these triads could, to a greater or lesser extent, by used &gt; as<br/>&gt; analogs to the familiar 4:5:6 as bases for tonal music.</p><p>To a certain extent, they could.</p><p>&gt;  Right now I&apos;m<br/>&gt; looking for all the lowest-complexity lowest-error temperaments for each &gt; of<br/>&gt; these and indexing EDOs which do a good job with them.
