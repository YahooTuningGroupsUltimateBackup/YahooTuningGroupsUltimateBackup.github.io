Several of them had websites, and I added them to my<br/>Microtonalists page. As always, I appreciate any new info, so send me<br/>info if you have it. Joe Monzo said he might come through Denver, and I<br/>hope to see him and do some playing.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</a></p></div>
