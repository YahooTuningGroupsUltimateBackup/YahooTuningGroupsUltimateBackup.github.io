I know this to be an italian-only<br/>&gt;&gt; phenomenon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it certainly became a german and french phenomenon too by the 17th<br/>&gt; century, though typically with only around 14 notes per octave . . .<br/>&gt; but i honestly don&apos;t know enough about elizabethan england to comment<br/>&gt; on the possibility of such instuments being used by isolated<br/>&gt; composers . . .</p><p>Dropping in for a second here to say: a while ago I scanned some images of<br/>split-key keyboards from Mersenne&apos;s treatise Harmonie Universelle, 1636,<br/>and dropped them in the files section. Perhaps not hugely germane to your<br/>discussion but I thought I&apos;d mention it Aaron in case you haven&apos;t seen<br/>them. They&apos;re in a folder called &quot;terrain&quot; in the files section of the<br/>yahoo site. There are ones with 16, 18, 24, 26 and 31 keys per octave.</p><p>best -Jon Wild (I haven&apos;t been reading the list very much so I might miss<br/>a reply, don&apos;t take it personally)</p></div>
