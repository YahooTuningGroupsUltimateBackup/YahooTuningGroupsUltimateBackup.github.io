I am sorry to have to report<br/>this.  He is a very independent soul... also somewhat of a right-winger,<br/>which I detest, but a nice athiest, which I rather admire...  He&apos;s an<br/>odd duck, that is for certain...</p><p>The arrangement is the same as most people have with &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>sheet-music publishers... The publisher owns the copyright and I get 10%<br/>of the proceeds which is, admittedly, not much.  This is the traditional<br/>&quot;deal&quot; over many, many years.</p><p>So why do I give him any of my music?... Well, I can&apos;t handle it<br/>myself... by my nature, I would just give it away at my own expense.<br/>I&apos;m a very poor capitalist, so I would rather have others do the &quot;dirty<br/>work&quot; for me... [In my own defense, however, I have to admit I &quot;sneak&quot;<br/>copies of my pieces to performers who can&apos;t afford to buy them through<br/>the publisher -- but no telly!]</p><p>Virtually ALL of my music now includes microtonality, and, in fact, the<br/>publisher has pieces that are EXTENSIVELY microtonal, and things are<br/>going along OK with these... HOWEVER, I am no longer giving him any<br/>pieces that are PARTICULARLY microtonal, especially of an &quot;experimental&quot;<br/>nature... since I might want to include these in SPECIFICALLY microtonal<br/>publications OR things like the Doty &quot;compilation cassettes or CDs&quot; that<br/>this publisher wouldn&apos;t allow due to his unfortunate and, I believe,<br/>misinformed bias...</p><p>That&apos;s the skoop...</p><p>JP<br/>_________ ______ ____ __ _</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
