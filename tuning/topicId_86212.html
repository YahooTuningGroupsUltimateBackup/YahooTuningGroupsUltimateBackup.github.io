I emphasize this process was done on individual<br/>parameters of music, not on music itself. For example: music is done<br/>from notes, but music is something more than notes only. (Obvious<br/>fact often ignored even by some famous performers who don&apos;t play<br/>music, only notes.)<br/>So results of such analysis don&apos;t say too much about music itself as<br/>a language. It&apos;s still in the beginning.<br/>Main problems are: which parameters should be analyzed in certain<br/>music work in certain style (which are relevant for that style), and<br/>how to interpret the results...</p><p>You can do such analysis with Markov chains of various length - with<br/>two members in the chain you will have very common results which<br/>don&apos;t say much about the music. The more longer chains, you can get<br/>some patterns which have sense. This way you can analyse some work,<br/>compare it with the other works, try to find level of similarity or<br/>identity.</p><p>That&apos;s all you can do with it.</p><p>Concerning the music composition - there are more easy ways how to<br/>compose music, with more interesting results. Even in the computer<br/>assisted composition, algorithmic composition, there was some<br/>development, and some results. From the used methods I don&apos;t think<br/>using of pseudorandom generators can give musically good results,<br/>randomness is white noise and this is not so interesting.</p><p>Composition on the base of Markov chains is also possible, but it<br/>will be always done from the results of previous analysis. Thus it<br/>will be less or more similar to the analyzed composition, or music<br/>style (depending on the length of Markov chains). In my opinion this<br/>has no sense and you can even get more interesting results with some<br/>kind of controlled, filtered randomness.</p><p>What would be really interesting, if only computer analysis of music<br/>is possible to such depth, to make some musicological games from it,<br/>for example to create a virtual composer who will be able not only to<br/>invent music in the certain style, or personal style of historical<br/>composers or era, but to do something like morphing, for example a<br/>composer who will write music exactly in between let&apos;s say Chopin and<br/>Debussy, or to get more interesting results, Gesualdo and Ligeti...<br/>Or  40% of Bart&oacute;k, 35% Vivaldi, 20% Jobim and 5% gamelan... Or to<br/>compose new works of dead composers, as an scientifically based<br/>attempt to guess which music could have be written from 75 years old<br/>Mozart in 1831...</p><p>For this would be necessary to perform a multiparameter statistical<br/>analysis of all music and its parameters, together with compositional<br/>rules (how music is done as a language), create a huge database of<br/>results and feed a powerful computer with it.  OK, something for the<br/>next century musicologists. Until then we have to do such games with<br/>our limited powers. Which I do always with a pleasure...</p><p>Daniel Forr&oacute;</p><p>On 10 Feb 2010, at 5:08 PM, Sarn Ursell wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello tuners!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could assume that one of the good methods of creating &quot;human<br/>&gt; composed sounding&quot; microtonal music, is with the use of a Markov<br/>&gt; chain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let us say that I had 5 octaves of 12Et (60), and 7 note durations,<br/>&gt; with 3 note volumes (arbitary numbers, by the way....), this could<br/>&gt; give me a first order Markov chain, with approximately 1260 lines<br/>&gt; of code.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A second order Markov chain would have 1260^2 lines of code<br/>&gt; 1587600, and a third order Markov chain would have 1260^3 lines of<br/>&gt; code or 200037600 lines of code.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could further assume that the higher the order of the Markov<br/>&gt; chain, that music of ever greater complexity of music could be<br/>&gt; generated, and in principal, IF we got all of the parameters in our&gt; code, for a say 20000 order Markov chain, then we&apos;d have music<br/>&gt; which sounded very human like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In principal we could programe such a programe, in practice no,<br/>&gt; for, I mean, how bigger number is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1260^20000?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Please see my recent post to the alternative tuning list as to how<br/>&gt; big the numbers will become in music in the vast future).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What you have to realize about such a number is that, whilst it IS<br/>&gt; big, but it is NOT infinite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone ever done, or heard about music, especially microtonal<br/>&gt; music composed with Markov chains, and genetic algorithms used to<br/>&gt; make, and to manipulate Markov chains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Somewhere in the process you&apos;d have to listen to the music made<br/>&gt; with these huge beasts of code, to select and to mate them to make<br/>&gt; further generations of code.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, I do believe that computers will both think and feel in<br/>&gt; the 2030&apos;s, and I look forward to this day with awe and with fear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What if they take over, and start running the world?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---Sarn.</p></div><h3>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2010 1:29:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What would be really interesting, if only computer analysis of<br/>&gt; music is possible to such depth, to make some musicological games<br/>&gt; from it, for example to create a virtual composer who will be able<br/>&gt; not only to invent music in the certain style, or personal style of<br/>&gt; historical composers or era, but to do something like morphing, for<br/>&gt; example a composer who will write music exactly in between let&apos;s<br/>&gt; say Chopin and Debussy, or to get more interesting results,<br/>&gt; Gesualdo and Ligeti...<br/>&gt; Or  40% of Bart&oacute;k, 35% Vivaldi, 20% Jobim and 5% gamelan...
