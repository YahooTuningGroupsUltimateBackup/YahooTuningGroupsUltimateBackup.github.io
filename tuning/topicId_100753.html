Its slow pace would be relaxed if not for the tension that&apos;s built in, very skilfully, by what I&apos;d normally call &quot;chromatic&quot; steps -- but I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s appropriate for this post. I&apos;m wondering how much of that tension would be lost if the tuning were different; I once asked the list if they could think of something that would sound &quot;out of tune&quot; in 12-equal, and I&apos;d bet this is one of those things.</p><p>Thanks for posting the link.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>7/14/2011 7:26:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just Intonation uses an undertone series for its  scale tones (e.g., 4/3,<br/>6/5, 8/5, 5/3, etc.).

I thought you were referring to Just Intonation at first as well, until I saw your response.</p><p>What interval do you use for the minor third then?  19/16?  And the rest of the intervals?</p><p>Ryan</p></div>
