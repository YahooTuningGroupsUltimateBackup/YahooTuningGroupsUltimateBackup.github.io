It&apos;s the bane of this retuning business;<br/>there<br/>&gt; are also some goofball files which cause other problems. Maybe<br/>Manuel<br/>&gt; would be interested in taking a look.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; in the 7th, there are many, many places where,<br/>&gt; &gt; for example, C# and Db are manifestly *not* supposed<br/>&gt; &gt; to be the same pitch!  and Mahler is all over the<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic map on this one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Romantic era composers (if you count Mahler as one) do seem to<br/>differ<br/>&gt; in how much 12-equal suits them. After fooling with the<br/>Apassionata, I<br/>&gt; decided it was a bad way to prove my point; the thing doesn&apos;t really<br/>&gt; need sweet thirds and might sound rather interesting in Pythagorean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   so there&apos;s no way that<br/>&gt; &gt; a 12-tone set will suffice, and there were *many*<br/>&gt; &gt; moments in your retuned versions where the tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; sounded awful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Grail is a strange new concept in circulating temperment, where<br/>weird<br/>&gt; stuff does happen.

I happened to be in the first concert they did 3 years ago when they started touring in front of an orchestra; one of my best friends and colleagues, a film and concert composer of very good chops (and who had been a REAL Yes fan for decades) was tapped by the band to do the arrangements. He worked hard with them to find something that worked, did the best he could to add to what were already bloated and busy tunes, and came up with fairly good backing material (any time the orch stuff started to have any presence or character they complained). After a lot of hard work and a successful beginning to the tour, they shafted him and got a cheap for-hire conductor.</p><p>During rehearsals I was apalled at the low-level of musicianship in the band, though I didn&apos;t get much of a sense of Steve Howe, as he seemed in his own little world and focussed on his solos. But they couldn&apos;t even discuss music in basic musical terms, and the end result often looked like out-takes from &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;.</p><p>It bums me, because while I didn&apos;t stay with the band for years I had fond memories and some nice tunes in my head, and they managed to blow that out of the water by being clods. Any rock and roll band worth it&apos;s salt comprises an energy and edge that no orchstration I&apos;ve ever heard or played can match. The closest I&apos;ve ever heard a classical group capture the zip of &apos;rock&apos; was Ensemble Moderne&apos;s traversal of Zappa&apos;s music on &quot;The Yellow Shark&quot;. Plenty of bite, tight rhythms and agressive sound. Orchestras can&apos;t really do that.</p><p>At least not as currently constituated. In the future?
