That info is so useful. It is interesting that &gt; epimoric ratios do difference tones in a specific way. Do you play &gt; a double ocarina?</p><p>Only occasionally, just for fun. But it is definitely the best acoustic instrument to experiment beautiful difference tones, and at very soft levels. Many people say that difference tones can be heard only at loud levels, because they have not experimented them with double ocarinas. But double ocarinas shows the contrary. You need to try different sizes double-ocarinas, and with various size holes in order to make very fine pitch adjustments.<br/>One thing I should have added about fundamental frequencies, but certainly you know aready : you can hear them by playing dyads of epimoric ratios better than any other intervals, on a guitar (or other instruments) plugged in a distorsion effect (fuzz box or distorsion pedal). Guitarist Jon Catler (from the Microtones) used to play solo melodies of fundamental frequencies that way on stage, with perfect control.</p><p>&gt; Could you say more about: As such, because relatively to their size &gt; they have the highest possible fundamental frequency. As my maths &gt; is still in the seedling stage.</p><p>Because their fundamental frequency is in unisson with their difference tone, and it can never be higher. With other JI intervals, fundamental frequency are sub-harmonics of the difference tones, that means they&apos;re much lower (when they are audible). And the more complex a ratio is, the less chances you have to hear these fundamental frequencies.</p><p>&gt; Re: How do you experiment binaural beating of harmonic ratios ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have recently been inspired by some music by Dave Siedel http://&gt; <a href="http://mysterybear.net/article/30">mysterybear.net/article/30</a> where he uses &apos;binaural twins&apos; to &gt; explore the notes in La Monte Young&apos;s &apos;Magic Opening Chord&apos; (see &gt; link for mp3 download and some description of his modus operandi). &gt; The scale itself is amazing consonant consiering it has such &gt; clusters of intervals (I can&apos;t quite figure out how come), but the &gt; addition of the polyrhythmic binaura beating is quite something.</p><p>Thanks for sharing. Interesting experience. At the end I was still hearing beautiful tiny sounds going on, I thought it was some extra in the piece but I took the headphones off and realized it was in my head.<br/>It reminds me some of the best pieces of a french lady, inspired electroacoustic composer that likes long ambient beatings a lot, Eliane Radigue. But this is more archetypal.<br/>(I enjoyed also the 2nd piece, &quot;Invocation&quot;).</p><p>&gt; I  love epimoric ratios and there &apos;middle path properties&apos;, so I &gt; have been using them as the basis to make binaural beating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example:<br/>&gt; You can say play a 17/16 at 127.5hz in the left channell and a &gt; 15/14 at 128.57 hz in the right channell and you hear a 16/15 (Db &gt; in JI scale). but with a rhythmic pulsation as well. Then when you &gt; do this with another harmonically related ratio you get not just &gt; the harmony, but also rhythmic patterns.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lets share the treasure<br/>&gt; Steve</p><p>Very interesting.
