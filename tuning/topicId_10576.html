Pythagorean tuning and accidentals<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>To what Dan Stearns and others have contributed regarding the spelling<br/>of Pythagorean schisma thirds, I might mainly a general rule which can<br/>help in working out such intervals.</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, each flat or sharp lowers or raises a note by a<br/>large or chromatic semitone, 2187:2048 or ~113.69 cents -- often<br/>convenient to treat as a rounded 114 cents.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s consider the interval C-E#. Here we have a regular<br/>major third C-E at 81:64, a rounded 408 cents, plus the chromatic<br/>semitone E-E# or 114 cents, giving around 522 cents in all. This is a<br/>Pythagorean comma larger than a regular 4:3 fourth, around 498 cents,<br/>often known as an augmented third or &quot;Wolf fourth.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, the regular fourth C-F has a major third C-E plus the<br/>small or diatonic semitone E-F, 256:243 or a rounded 90 cents -- here<br/>408 + 90 cents gives 498 cents, a normal 4:3 fourth.</p><p>Thus C-E#, for example, is a Pythagorean comma _wider_ than C-F; this<br/>comma is equal to the difference between the two semitones,<br/>531441:524288 or ~23.46 cents -- following convention, let&apos;s call it a<br/>rounded 24 cents.</p><p>Likewise a Pythagorean diminished fourth or schisma major third,<br/>e.g. C-Fb in the example from Dan Stearns, subtracts a chromatic<br/>semitone Fb-F from the regular fourth C-F -- 498 - 114 = 384 cents.<br/>This is a 24-cent comma smaller than the usual major third C-E at<br/>81:64, equal to the fourth C-F less the diatonic semitone E-F -- about<br/>490 - 90 = 408 cents.</p><p>A Pythagorean augmented second or schisma minor third, e.g. Fb-G in<br/>Dan&apos;s example, is equal to a usual whole-tone F-G at 9:8, a rounded<br/>204 cents, plus the chromatic semitone Fb-F -- 204 + 114 or 318<br/>cents. This is a 24-cent comma larger than the usual minor third E-G,<br/>a whole-tone F-G plus a diatonic semitone E-F -- 204 + 90 or 294 cents<br/>(32:27).</p><p>Thus one method for estimating the size of an unfamiliar Pythagorean<br/>interval is to start with the size of the unaltered interval (no<br/>sharps or flats), and then to add or subtract 114 cents for each sharp<br/>or flat.</p><p>For example, how about C-D##? Without accidentals, we would have a<br/>whole-tone C-D of about 204 cents. Each sharp adds 114 cents, or 228<br/>cents in all, so we have 204 + 228 = 432 cents. This is a &quot;septimal<br/>schisma major third&quot; a 24-cent comma larger than the regular C-E, or<br/>about 3.8 cents smaller than 9:7.</p><p>How about A#-Db? Our unaltered interval would be a regular fourth A-D,<br/>or 498 cents, and both the sharp and the flat in this case subtract<br/>114 cents each by raising the lower note and lowering the upper one,<br/>so we have 498 - 228 or 270 cents, a &quot;septimal schisma minor third&quot; a<br/>24-cent comma smaller than the usual 32:27 minor third A#-C# or Bb-Db<br/>at around 294 cents, or about 3.8 cents larger than 7:6.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>2. Conversities, inversions, and chromaticism<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>In reply to your response, maybe I should begin by observing that<br/>while the concept of conversity applies specifically to multi-voice<br/>sonorities with three or more voices and intervals, the concept of<br/>inversion can also apply to simple two-voice intervals.</p><p>A conversity is defined a relationship between multi-voice sonorities<br/>sharing the same set of intervals in different arrangements. Since<br/>there is only one arrangement of a single interval, conversity does<br/>not apply.</p><p>In contrast, inversion can apply to a two-voice interval, for example<br/>the major second C3-D3, which has the inversion of D3-C4, a minor<br/>seventh; more generally, we can say that major seconds and minor<br/>sevenths are inversions. I like to describe such intervals as &quot;octave<br/>complements&quot; -- thus M2 and m7 together make an octave.</p><p>Octave complements often have interesting affinities in various<br/>musics, but not always and in all ways: thus in 13th-century Western<br/>European theory, M3 is often classified as an &quot;imperfect concord&quot;<br/>(relatively blending but mildly unstable), but m6 as a &quot;perfect<br/>discord&quot; (acutely tense).</p><p>Mostly for the sake of simplicity, I used mainly diatonic note<br/>spellings in my examples, but the concept of conversity can equally<br/>apply to the many medieval and Renaissance sonorities involving<br/>accidentals -- used either to form regularly spelled intervals of the<br/>usual types, or less &quot;usual&quot; intervals ranging from early 15th-century<br/>Pythagorean schisma thirds to the &quot;enharmonic&quot; intervals of Vicentino<br/>(1555) altered by a meantone diesis of about 1/5-tone.</p><p>Whatever the merits of a 20th-century &quot;interval class&quot; theory, which<br/>treats octave complements as equivalent -- a useful system for some<br/>purposes, but not a universal assumption -- I would emphasize that the<br/>general concept can be applied to tunings with fewer or more than 12<br/>pitch classes per octave. Thus we have 53 such classes in a<br/>quasi-cyclical Pythagorean tuning or 53-tone equal temperament<br/>(53-tet), 31 basic classes in Vicentino&apos;s system or 31-tet, etc.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>3. Pythagorean &quot;septimal schisma&quot; intervals<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>To answer a basic historical question quickly, I&apos;m not aware of any<br/>medieval sources describing or advocating the use of these intervals.<br/>Rather, their use is a feature of the modern &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; tuning, a<br/>24-note Pythagorean scheme discussed in a post I made to the Tuning<br/>List around the first week of July 1998 -- when the list was at Mills<br/>College. I would be glad to supply copies by e-mail.</p><p>Around 1325, Jacobus of Liege does actually describe a _tonus maior_<br/>or &quot;larger whole-tone&quot; formed by two chromatic semitones, as opposed<br/>to the normal whole-tone at 9:8, formed by a diatonic and a chromatic<br/>semitone. As it happens, this _tonus maior_ (~228 cents) is in modern<br/>terms a septimal schisma interval about 3.80 cents smaller than 8:7;<br/>but Jacobus regards it as an ill-formed and highly discordant<br/>variation on the normal whole-tone, not a practical interval.</p><p>In that same era, 1318, Marchettus of Padua describes the use of very<br/>narrow semitones in common 14th-century cadential progressions.<br/>However, his tuning mathematics for these semitones are not<br/>conventional Pythagorean, and additionally leave lots of room for<br/>differing interpretations.</p><p>A modern tuning system, Xeno-Gothic, takes one possible interpretation<br/>of Marchettus (for example, very wide major thirds and sixths in<br/>directed resolutions of M3-5 and M6-8 to stable fifths and octaves by<br/>stepwise contrary motion), and implements this in a Pythagorean tuning<br/>by using major thirds near 9:7 and sixths near 12:7 -- a comma larger<br/>than usual.</p><p>However, this is my neo-Pythagorean implementation of one possible<br/>reading of Marchettus&apos;s suggestions regarding cadences -- as opposed<br/>to a medieval source describing the use of such a tuning.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
