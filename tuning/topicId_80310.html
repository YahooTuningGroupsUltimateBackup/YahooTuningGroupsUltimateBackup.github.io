The point here is that the accuracy has essentially nothing to do with our hearing but it allows us to better trace the method which was used to find that tuning/scale, which is often important for analyzing and comparing temperaments.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=80315 href="#80315">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2009 11:27:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forro &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for asking such unpleasant questions and destroy your toys,<br/>&gt;but<br/>&gt; I wonder:</p><p>Revealing your ignorance isn&apos;t going to destroy anybody&apos;s toys, I<br/>wouldn&apos;t think.</p><p>&gt; - which synthesizer can set tuning with such accuracy</p><p>Software synthesizers can be tuned with extreme accuracy.

You can write in binary, hex or septimal system, this is<br/>just a way of writing the number. But basic problem is always here:<br/>how to convert it to real world, that means sound, interval, acoustic<br/>or electronic instrument, and even when converted with high accuracy,<br/>who will be able to recognize it?</p><p>I wonder as a composer and performer why you worked with intervals<br/>which nobody can recognize. In my opinion it has no practical sense.<br/>If we make music, there are some practical limitations in interval<br/>size, which of course differ and depend on listener&apos;s experience with<br/>microtonality and musical education. Exact size of such smallest<br/>recognizable interval in musical practice is thing of discussion, but<br/>for sure there is some limit. For me personally it&apos;s 5 Cents, I&apos;m not<br/>interested to make music with more steps in octave then 240 (in the<br/>case of ET). To cross a border in the direction to smaller intervals<br/>is a pure game with numbers far from reality. Nothing against game with numbers, I like, too. But music itself is more important for me<br/>than some numbers. Even very nice and well calculated numbers on the<br/>input can have poor musical result. Anyway, thay are just numbers,<br/>and good music has something more inside.</p><p>I just asked how Chris or others solve this in musical practice, and<br/>with MIDI instruments with limited accuracy. OK, I answer to myself:<br/>it&apos;s necessary to work with hardware we have, so only approximation<br/>is possible and we have to round numbers. Which is not necessarily a<br/>problem, as for melody 5 Cents accuracy is good enough for common<br/>ears, even for experienced ones, and for chords Yamaha&apos;s 1.171895<br/>Cent unfortunately must be good enough, too... Such compromises must<br/>be terribly painful for all of us with scientific approach, am I<br/>right?

Programs like Scala allow<br/>input data like &bdquo;5/4&ldquo; and can distinguish them from sizes in cents (just for<br/>your information, Chris, it would be much clearer what you mean if you wrote<br/>5/4 instead of 386.3137138 cents -- both mean the same interval).</p><p>And finally, don&rsquo;t know if this is the case, but many times, I have found<br/>myself in a situation when I needed to work with very tiny intervals and<br/>preserve their sizes regardless of whether someone is listening to them or<br/>not. For example, if I&rsquo;m making a scale which should temper out a very small<br/>interval or if I&rsquo;m calculating beat rates for tempered intervals, it&rsquo;s often<br/>important to preserve the interval sizes sometimes even as accurate as to<br/>1000ths of a cent despite the fact there&rsquo;s probably no device that can be<br/>tuned so accurately. The point here is that the accuracy has essentially<br/>nothing to do with our hearing but it allows us to better trace the method<br/>which was used to find that tuning/scale, which is often important for<br/>analyzing and comparing temperaments.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=80321 href="#80321">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2009 5:14:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for polite explanation without personal arrogant and aggressive attacks.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s exactly my point, those decimals are not necessary in musical practice.

Scale is made from intervals and frequencies, so of course it is important. When somebody invented some scale, for sure it has some reason why this or that interval of certain accuracy was selected. We can discuss how much Cents (or Hz) differences can be still recognized.</p><p>- Yes, it&apos;s quite easy to convert Cent table to SysEx data for any hardware synth with microtonal feature, but it&apos;s necessary to round the numbers, which can lead to approximation errors +/-1 or 2 Cents or so maximally. That was my point. I don&apos;t have experience how software synths handle it, but we have experts here saying it works with high accuracy. So far so good.</p><p>- Interval/tuning/scale accuracy is of course important part of discussion. Which sense would be in inventing some scale or tuning system, and then not keeping the rules which we invented because of not enough accuracy?

But even though, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we should remove the decimal places that we find meaningless. For example, if you make temperaments in Scala (I mean, for Vallotti/Young, for example, you tell the program to chain 6 fifths narrower by 1/6 of a Pyth. comma and 6 pure fifths) and save this into a &bdquo;.scl&ldquo; file, the cent sizes contained in the file will be rounded to 5 decimal places (i.e. to the nearest ten-thousandth of a cent), which is obviously meaningless for converting to SysEx commands. But if the program has the ability to do it this way and is internally &bdquo;set&ldquo; to do it like that, then there&rsquo;s no reason for removing the unwanted numerals from the output file and it would just tak&eacute; your time to do that. Further more, if you leave them there, you can much more easily know the method which was used to get to the particular tuning. For example, in quarter-comma meantone, we know that 4 fifths minus 2 octaves should be ~386 cents, which means that 4 fifths should be ~2786 cents (assuming we want pure octaves). Splitting this value into 4 equal steps gives you 696.5 cents. If you then rounded all the interval sizes to the nearest cent, you would get a chain of alternating fifths of 696 and 697 cents and the temperament listing would lose its &bdquo;regularity&ldquo;. But if you preserve the original sizes, you&rsquo;ll immediately realize that there&rsquo;s nothing else going on here but a straight chain of fifths of one particular size, which really is the concept of meantone. Further more, don&rsquo;t know if you have ever tried it, but if you compare a 697 cent fifth with a 696.5 cent fifth, it&lsquo;s just a different sound -- I can also demonstrate this, if you like.</p><p>&gt; how to convert it to real world, that means sound, interval, acoustic<br/>&gt; or electronic instrument, and even when converted with high accuracy,<br/>&gt; who will be able to recognize it?</p><p>From my personal experience, even if highly accurate numbers are not of much use in music, they are of good use, for example, when making an electronic version of a &bdquo;model&ldquo; temperament for later tuning on acoustic instruments, despite the fact that no acoustic instrument can be tuned so accurately and that harpsichord or piano strings may have slightly &bdquo;mistuned&ldquo; overtones sometimes. AFAIK, Cool Edit rounds the input frequency data to the nearest &bdquo;ten-millionth&ldquo; of a Hz, which, at a frequency of 16Hz (which is among the slowest frequencies you could possibly call a &bdquo;tone&ldquo;), is about a millionth of a cent. My small Qbasic utility from 2004 for making periodic sawtooth waves could handle the input frequencies with even better accuracy. In those years, I was often working with temperaments based on equal beat rates and I realized I could only do the job with very accurate numbers if I really wanted the beat rates to be equal. For example, suppose you make a temperament where both C-E and E-G beat 2 times per second. If you change the pitch of one of the tones by just a tenth of a cent, the beat rates change so remarcably that you can&rsquo;t consider them equal anymore. Again, this is not something which should matter in actual music, but it does matter in the way a particular tuning/temperament is described.</p><p>&gt; I wonder as a composer and performer why you worked with intervals<br/>&gt; which nobody can recognize. In my opinion it has no practical sense.</p><p>If you are working with very small &bdquo;commas&ldquo; which can get very widely distributed in a particular temperament, sooner or later, you may find that the amount of tempering can be even as small as a fraction of a cent. And in some very rare cases, even the comma itself can be smaller than a cent. One example of the former is the 5-limit schisma (i.e. 8 pure fourths minus 3 octaves minus a pure major third), which is just about 2 cents in size; an example of the latter can be the &bdquo;ragisma&ldquo; (i.e. the semi-augmented second of 8/7 minus 3 pure fourths plus 4 pure minor thirds), which is just about 0.4 cents. As you can see, both the schisma and the ragisma have many many possibilities how they can be distributed among the mentioned intervals. If you make temperaments using these, they will definitely sound like JI because such tiny pitch alterations are not recognizable by our ear. But it is often useful to have these small interval sizes preserved because then you can easily spot how the particular temperament was made and therefore what are the target intervals we are trying to approximate in it. Further more, even though the schisma itself is about 2 cents in size, it can happily be distributed in such a way that one fifth will be only about 1/8th of a cent flat of pure, which is a far far better option than to have 7 or 8 pure fifths followed by one 2-cent flat fifth in the chain. If you use the &bdquo;untempered&ldquo; version with one fifth 2 cents flat, then the one fifth&rsquo;s slow beating can be (sometimes( audible when compared to the other fifths in the chain. On the other side, if you use the tempered version where each fifth is flattened by only about 1/8 of a cent, all the fifths will sound as if they were JI, even though they are not.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=80368 href="#80368">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2009 11:06:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; AFAIK, Cool Edit rounds the input frequency data to the nearest &bdquo;ten-millionth&ldquo; of a Hz,</p><p>Oops ...

It will be covered by<br/>other notes vertically and horizontally, nobody will mention it.Music is much higher level of language, we feel complex stories,<br/>articles and sentences, not individual phonems.<br/>&gt; &gt; how to convert it to real world, that means sound, interval,<br/>&gt; acoustic<br/>&gt; &gt; or electronic instrument, and even when converted with high<br/>&gt; accuracy,<br/>&gt; &gt; who will be able to recognize it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From my personal experience, even if highly accurate numbers are<br/>&gt; not of much use in music, they are of good use, for example, when&gt; making an electronic version of a &bdquo;model&ldquo; temperament for later<br/>&gt; tuning on acoustic instruments, despite the fact that no acoustic<br/>&gt; instrument can be tuned so accurately and that harpsichord or piano<br/>&gt; strings may have slightly &bdquo;mistuned&ldquo; overtones sometimes. AFAIK,<br/>&gt; Cool Edit rounds the input frequency data to the nearest &bdquo;ten-<br/>&gt; millionth&ldquo; of a Hz, which, at a frequency of 16Hz (which is among<br/>&gt; the slowest frequencies you could possibly call a &bdquo;tone&ldquo;), is<br/>&gt; about a millionth of a cent. My small Qbasic utility from 2004 for<br/>&gt; making periodic sawtooth waves could handle the input frequencies<br/>&gt; with even better accuracy. In those years, I was often working with<br/>&gt; temperaments based on equal beat rates and I realized I could only<br/>&gt; do the job with very accurate numbers if I really wanted the beat<br/>&gt; rates to be equal. For example, suppose you make a temperament<br/>&gt; where both C-E and E-G beat 2 times per second. If you change the<br/>&gt; pitch of one of the tones by just a tenth of a cent, the beat rates<br/>&gt; change so remarcably that you can&rsquo;t consider them equal anymore.<br/>&gt; Again, this is not something which should matter in actual music,<br/>&gt; but it does matter in the way a particular tuning/temperament is<br/>&gt; described.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, this is scientific attitude. My original questions were directed<br/>to dealing with this in practice.<br/>&gt; &gt; I wonder as a composer and performer why you worked with intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; which nobody can recognize. In my opinion it has no practical sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are working with very small &bdquo;commas&ldquo; which can get very<br/>&gt; widely distributed in a particular temperament, sooner or later,<br/>&gt; you may find that the amount of tempering can be even as small as a<br/>&gt; fraction of a cent. And in some very rare cases, even the comma<br/>&gt; itself can be smaller than a cent. One example of the former is the<br/>&gt; 5-limit schisma (i.e. 8 pure fourths minus 3 octaves minus a pure<br/>&gt; major third), which is just about 2 cents in size; an example of<br/>&gt; the latter can be the &bdquo;ragisma&ldquo; (i.e. the semi-augmented second<br/>&gt; of 8/7 minus 3 pure fourths plus 4 pure minor thirds), which is<br/>&gt; just about 0.4 cents. As you can see, both the schisma and the<br/>&gt; ragisma have many many possibilities how they can be distributed<br/>&gt; among the mentioned intervals. If you make temperaments using<br/>&gt; these, they will definitely sound like JI because such tiny pitch<br/>&gt; alterations are not recognizable by our ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, that&apos;s exactly what I wanted to hear - not recognizable. That&apos;s<br/>real life.<br/>&gt; But it is often useful to have these small interval sizes preserved<br/>&gt; because then you can easily spot how the particular temperament was<br/>&gt; made and therefore what are the target intervals we are trying to<br/>&gt; approximate in it. Further more, even though the schisma itself is<br/>&gt; about 2 cents in size, it can happily be distributed in such a way<br/>&gt; that one fifth will be only about 1/8th of a cent flat of pure,&gt; which is a far far better option than to have 7 or 8 pure fifths<br/>&gt; followed by one 2-cent flat fifth in the chain. If you use the<br/>&gt; &bdquo;untempered&ldquo; version with one fifth 2 cents flat, then the one<br/>&gt; fifth&rsquo;s slow beating can be (sometimes( audible when compared to<br/>&gt; the other fifths in the chain. On the other side, if you use the<br/>&gt; tempered version where each fifth is flattened by only about 1/8 of<br/>&gt; a cent, all the fifths will sound as if they were JI, even though<br/>&gt; they are not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, this is scientific face of coin again. Audible when you dospecial test, not in running music.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3><a id=80374 href="#80374">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>1/30/2009 6:50:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com">http://micro.soonlabel.com</a></p><p>Dan&apos;s  Work on 20Tet<br/>Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt;</p><p>Date: Fri, 30 Jan 2009 07:14:18<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Michael Sheiman&apos;s harmonic derived scale.</p><p>I&apos;ve got multiple HDDs set up with XP, Vista, and 7.<br/>Mainly I just need a clear weekend to work on it.  -Carl</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for those moments when the migration gets too intense try<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">www.virtualbox.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; its free, which is a very nice price.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - I have an XP Pro install in a virtual machine in a Vista 64<br/>&gt; installation exclusively using a USB wireless adaptor running<br/>&gt; Netflix full screen video - ~30 - 35% cpu load doing that and<br/>&gt; its fast - it really runs as it it were its own machine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and if you don&apos;t like it - delete the virtual hard drive and<br/>&gt; *poof* its gone.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80379 href="#80379">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2009 5:46:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would agree  that a good judge of a scale is it  to &quot;jamming&quot;.
