Frankly, entropy and Tenney-height be damned, I don&apos;t hear any dissonance on the whole pitch-spectrum between 10/9 and 6/5...and I&apos;m tempted to say all the way up to about 333 cents, even.  Dyadically-speaking, of course.  On the other hand, I hear a whole lot of dissonance between 5/4 and 4/3.  Anything between about 410 and 466 I hear as quite gnarly.

I don&apos;t attach the connotations of &quot;bears psychoacoustic resemblance to&quot;, &quot;can substitute for&quot;, or &quot;gives the impression of&quot;.  14:18:21 is in proximity to 4:5:6, more so than 10:13:15, and it&apos;s a known fact that being in proximity to a low-entropy triad is associated with a decrease in entropy.

I say this mostly because we describe it qualitatively as a &quot;supermajor&quot; triad, suggesting that we interpret it as a modified major triad.  Of course, I will admit that musicians for whom I have played supermajor triads have said both &quot;it sounds like an augmented chord, sort of&quot; and &quot;it sounds almost like a diminished chord&quot;, though when alternated with a regular major triad most hear it as a sort of &quot;half-suspension&quot; and when alternated or used in progressions with subminor triads, it just sounds &quot;like a nasty major chord&quot;.  So my intuition says that the proximity to all three of those triads (4:5:6, 5:6:7, 7:9:11) can be felt, depending on the listener&apos;s mental state and the degree of priming.

Some ratios are audibly beatless, others are not, but beatlessness is not the defining principle of intervallic identity.  Saying that 9/7 is a &quot;type of major 3rd&quot; is in no way saying it&apos;s a &quot;bad/weak 5/4&quot;.  If you look at the range of what can function as a major 3rd, you&apos;ll notice that 5/4 is near-about in the center, which can be taken to mean whatever you like.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;my intuition says that the proximity to all three of those triads  (4:5:6,<br/>&gt; &gt;5:6:7, 7:9:11) can be felt, depending on the listener&apos;s mental  state and the<br/>&gt; &gt;degree of priming.&quot;<br/>&gt;    That is believable it can happen, but I doubt very often IE when is it &quot;easy&quot;<br/>&gt; to simply swap a major chord with a diminished one without changing the mood<br/>&gt; significantly?</p><p>Well, the point is that the supermajor triad bears some similarity to multiple triads at once, so it&apos;s not as if anything is being &quot;swapped&quot;...more like different aspects can be noticed under different circumstances.</p><p>&gt;   And well...let&apos;s say your &quot;pitch proximity&quot; idea does hold in most cases...how<br/>&gt; could that be used to help a musician pick a chord for a desired emotion (rather<br/>&gt; than using, say, the &quot;can substitute for&quot; definition myself and others often use<br/>&gt; for chord likeness)?  Maybe if you can find patterns in how priming &quot;makes<br/>&gt; chords act/be heard like other chords&quot; it could help...I, for one though, can&apos;t<br/>&gt; think of any easy examples of such priming.</p><p>Well, a musician never picks just one chord for a desired emotion.  But I will say this: start with a triad of root-4th-5th (i.e. like a 6:8:9), then drop the 4th down to about 450 cents.  The 450-cent interval will sound somewhat like a major 3rd.  Clear your ears for a minute, then play a major triad.  Then move the major 3rd *up* to about 450 cents.  The 450-cent interval will sound somewhat more like a 4th.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2010 2:51:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Do you mean you hear 10:13 to be more consonant than 7:9?</p><p>No, I meant what I said.

If you are also<br/>&gt; NOT saying 9/7 is a bad/weak 5/4 or, rather, a &quot;weaker&quot; major third...than what<br/>&gt; are you saying, what&apos;s the musical implication?</p><p>There is no musical implication.  This conversation was about harmonic entropy, which has nothing to do with music.  I hypothesized that 14:18:21 would have lower entropy than 10:13:15 on account of the fact that 14:18:21 approximates 4:5:6 better, i.e. is closer to it and possibly subject to a drop in entropy due to being in 4:5:6&apos;s entropy-well.  Steve&apos;s calculations, however, have shown this not to be the case.  10:13:15 and 14:18:21 are pretty close in entropy.</p><p>&gt; &gt;If you look at the range of what can function as a  major 3rd, you&apos;ll notice<br/>&gt; &gt;that 5/4 is near-about in the center&quot;<br/>&gt;   Again, you seem to be saying 9/7 is at the &quot;edge of a range&quot;...indirectly<br/>&gt; implying it&apos;s weaker.  Confusing....</p><p>Indirectly implying NOTHING.  You are confused because you keep superimposing your own ideas and prejudices on what I type, despite the fact that I disagree with them.</p><p>I do not think of intervals in terms of &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;, I think of them in terms of mood and quality.  I reject intervallic hierarchies, ideas such as &quot;error&quot; and &quot;mistuning&quot;.  There are no bad intervals.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Well, the point is that the supermajor triad bears some similarity to  multiple<br/>&gt; &gt;triads at once, so it&apos;s not as if anything is being  &quot;swapped&quot;...more like<br/>&gt; &gt;different aspects can be noticed under different  circumstances.  &quot;<br/>&gt;   Ok, now this is starting to make sense.<br/>&gt;   So, the further away IN PITCH DISTANCE from a &quot;tonal center&quot; like 5/4 more<br/>&gt; dyads in a chord are...the more likely a chord can swap musical purposes (not to<br/>&gt; say the chord is necessarily weaker but, instead, more &quot;swappable&quot;)?   That I<br/>&gt; certainly agree with...</p><p>Yes, now you have got it.  We are acculturated to categorize intervals in a certain way, and to categorize chords in certain ways.  While we microtonalists tend to have more categories at our disposal into which we can place intervals and chords, naive common-practice-trained musicians (and most average listeners) don&apos;t.  So microtonal chords--like the supermajor triad--which are somewhat between &quot;normal&quot; categories will cause confusion to many listeners if they hear the chord &quot;nakedly&quot;.  Given some context, however, they&apos;ll be able to &quot;figure it out&quot;.  A good analogy to this phenomenon is to take a familiar word and misspell it horrendously, even to the point of just jumbling up the letters.  Viewed on its own, the word will look nonsensical.  But put it in a sentence where the properly-spelled word would make sense, and the mind is able to &quot;correct it&quot;.  Heck, you can take an entire paragraph and jumble the letters in each word, but it will still ultimately be legible because the relationship of each jumbled word to its neighbors gives enough cue for the mind to &quot;puzzle it out&quot;.</p><p>Now, to relate this back to &quot;swappability&quot;: ever here of synanagrams?  They&apos;re different words made up of the same letters, like leaf and flea or players/replays/parsley.  So imagine you take a word that has one or two syanagrams of it, and jumble up the letters.  Unless you put the jumbled letters in a sentence where only one of the synangrams will make sense, it will be difficult to un-jumble the letters.  So, effectively, that jumble of letters will be multiple words at once, and can switch between them depending on the reader&apos;s interpretation.  This, essentially, is what chords like neutral or supermajor triads are to some naive/average musicians/listeners.  To non-naive (i.e. microtonally-aware) listeners/musicians, this is not the case--the &quot;jumble of letters&quot; is a word in itself, i.e. it carries meaning which can be deciphered independently of context.</p><p>&gt;   The part I don&apos;t get is a chord fairly far, even in pure pitch distance, from<br/>&gt; a 4:5:6 like a 14:18:21&apos;s gravitating toward sounding like the 4:5:6 a huge<br/>&gt; majority of the time (if that&apos;s what you are saying), even with priming.   Also,<br/>&gt; who says it won&apos;t swap with, say, the 10:13:15 chord instead (since that chord<br/>&gt; IS closer in pitch distance than 4:5:6 is)?   Unless you ARE again assuming<br/>&gt; tonal gravitation toward 5/4...which is again why I&apos;m thinking you are pushing<br/>&gt; things based on Dyadic harmonic entropy rather than the &quot;Pitch Distance&quot; idea<br/>&gt; you claim to be championing.</p><p>Okay, look.  In my way of thinking, ratios do not define interval classes.  Saying that one ratio is &quot;heard as&quot; another is nonsense.  Ratios are a way of designating pitches--they are discrete, specific, exact, not wide enough to define a perceptual class.  It&apos;s as absurd to me to say that 14:18:21 is &quot;heard as&quot; 4:5:6 as it is to say that &quot;the number 2 is computed as the number 4&quot;.  Just because two ratios sound similar to each other, does not mean that there is any basis for saying that one ratio is &quot;heard as&quot; the other.  They are *both* heard as members of a larger and more general class.  Classes are fuzzy, they overlap each other, but they also have &quot;centers&quot; of clarity--which are determined by the listener&apos;s musical acculturation.  The number of classes and the fuzziness/overlap of their boundaries is entirely listener-dependent.  As I said above, 5/4 is &quot;near&quot; the center of what most listeners recognize as a major 3rd, but it is not *in* the center.  That would be 400 cents.  I say this because most musicians I&apos;ve played a pure 5/4 for have said it sounds &quot;a little flat&quot;.</p><p>For the purposes of categorizing 14:18:21 and 10:13:15, I am operating using standard diatonic chord classes.  Both of these chords are on the continuum between &quot;major triad&quot; and &quot;suspended 4th triad&quot;.  14:18:21 is significantly closer to the major triad than it is to the suspended 4th triad, whereas 10:13:15 is just about smack in the middle between them and could be interpreted as both or neither.</p><p>On the other hand, if we allow for more detailed intervallic categorization, and assume a listener that is as acculturated to something like 24-EDO as we are to 12-EDO, then there will be another chord-class between the major triad and the suspended 4th triad, though I&apos;m at a loss to name it.  For this listener accustomed to hearing a 0-450-700-cent triad, 14:18:21 will without a doubt be absorbed into *that* chord-class, rather than the class of &quot;major triad&quot;.</p><p>For me, with my combination of western acculturation and microtonal sensitivity, I consider &quot;supermajor triad&quot; to be a distinct class, and assuming a constant-size of 5th, the range of 3rds I consider &quot;supermajor&quot; runs from about 420 to 450 cents, which has 9/7 somewhere in the center.  Above 450 but below about 475, I&apos;d say there&apos;s another class of &quot;suspended flat-4th&quot;, which has 21/16 somewhere near the center.  So despite my microtonal sensitivity, I still find quarter-tone(ish) intervals right on the boundary between interval classes.  YMMV.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2010 2:11:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;There is no musical implication.
