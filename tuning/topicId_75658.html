You and Dean or possibly some of your students at Montclair State University might be interested.  Harry Partch mentioned this scale briefly in &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; without giving its tuning details.  It was independently rediscovered by the late Maria Renold, who later found that it had originally been published by Grammateus (now some 490 years ago) only a few years before the publication of quarter-comma meantone by Aron.  Whether any organs were ever tuned to it I don&apos;t know, but that seems unlikely as it includes equal tempered tritones and there was no method now known to tune these accurately until at least Helmholtz&apos; beat counting or possibly even as late as 1917.  The twelve chromatic scales include ten with perfect fifths, with the Pythagorean comma distributed evenly between the other two scales.  Otherwise, it might be described as semi-Pythagorean.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;<a href="mailto:langfordschnur@frontiernet.net">langfordschnur@frontiernet.net</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:langfordschnur@frontiernet.net">langfordschnur@frontiernet.net</a>&gt; 3/8/2008 5:14 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>----- Forwarded message from <a href="mailto:petercarol@juno.com">petercarol@juno.com</a> ----- Date: Sat, 8 Mar 2008 17:09:46 GMT From: &quot;<a href="mailto:petercarol@juno.com">petercarol@juno.com</a>&quot; Reply-To: &quot;<a href="mailto:petercarol@juno.com">petercarol@juno.com</a>&quot; Subject: Tuning Conf. 2 Brochure Final To: <a href="mailto:langfordschnur@frontiernet.net">langfordschnur@frontiernet.net</a> Cc: <a href="mailto:dhafner1964@hotmail.com">dhafner1964@hotmail.com</a> _____________________________________________________________ Discount Online Trading - Click Now! <a href="http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2121/fc/Ioyw6i3mJ8Xzlm432P6KPhwjMMiPXmxssIjTHm94BE7igFE1cOWB5a/">http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2121/fc/Ioyw6i3mJ8Xzlm432P6KPhwjMMiPXmxssIjTHm94BE7igFE1cOWB5a/</a> ----- End forwarded message -----</p></div>
