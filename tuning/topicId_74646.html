namely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because there was so much of interest,<br/>&gt; i had written my own recap of the Friday<br/>&gt; 7 December 2007 Music By Computer meeting<br/>&gt; from memory late that night.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never posted it before because i wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; sure about my memory of some of the items<br/>&gt; i was less interested in (in particular<br/>&gt; here i can recall some programs Gary showed<br/>&gt; us which were designed to emulate old Atari<br/>&gt; music software ... maybe he can say more here).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So without any editing, but simply quoting<br/>&gt; Gary&apos;s post below it for comparison, here<br/>&gt; is my version of the meeting ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Music by Computer meeting<br/>&gt; Friday, 7 December 2007<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

remember it, so i include it here from Gary&apos;s post]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Astralis<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; softsynth<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; advertizes that it has microtonal capability<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

mappings of Scala microtonal scales generally begin on<br/>&gt; C<br/>&gt; and extraneous notes are on black keys, tuned to<br/>&gt; refernce pitch in that octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i examined:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * category:Indian, tuning:22-srutis<br/>&gt; 22 srutis mapped to 2 ocaves of: (white keys + C#/Db,<br/>&gt; D#/Eb, F#/Gb, G#/Ab)<br/>&gt; A#/Bb in each octave tuned to reference pitch<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

enables old synths to be mapped to non-12 microtonal<br/>&gt; tunings<br/>&gt; Brink and Jonathan have it hooked up to a Roland D-20<br/>&gt; here&apos;s the webpage:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://h-pi.com/TBX1buy.html">http://h-pi.com/TBX1buy.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

modes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the C-5 is virtually useless now, because it&apos;s so<br/>&gt; obsolete<br/>&gt; but it sparked a discussion of some computer and music<br/>&gt; hardware museums,<br/>&gt; both virtual (online) and in real life<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ==============<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz:<br/>&gt; *****<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; played latest version of .tonescape Mahler 7th/1<br/>&gt; (fairly complete in notes/phrasing up to m.144)<br/>&gt; mainly for Brink, since he heard the 2007.12.01<br/>&gt; version last Saturday<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but Gary and Kat both listened and watched Tonescape<br/>&gt; with great interest<br/>&gt; both volunteered to use exported MIDI-file of it with<br/>&gt; their own VST&apos;s to make great .mp3&apos;s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

But Kat and Gary both wanted<br/>to hear what it sounded like with really good VST sounds.</p><p>Except for one instrument (acoustic guitar) which can<br/>make .wav, .aif, and Csound files, Tonescape so far can<br/>otherwise only produce sound via General MIDI.</p><p>One note about my procedure: i&apos;ve decided that for<br/>Tonescape files i make of anything from the standard<br/>repertoire, i&apos;m going to use a 31-tone chain of some<br/>form of meantone. The 31-note chain-of-5ths from<br/>Gbb to Ax covers almost everything that was composed<br/>up to around 1900.</p><p>This way, once the entire file has been sequenced in<br/>Tonescape, i can easily swap the tuning to any other<br/>which uses 31 notes.</p><p>So, for example, i can hear the Mahler 7th/1 not only<br/>in 1/6-comma meantone, but also in 31-edo, or a<br/>31-out-of-55-edo, or even a 31-tone chain of 699.99-cent<br/>meantone (which is, for all practical purposes, 12-edo<br/>-- but it preserves the notational distinction between<br/>the flats and sharps).</p><p>-monz</p><p>email: joemonz(AT)<a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
