One of them, the mexican Juli&iuml;&iquest;&half;n Carrillo has written the book titled &quot;Sonido 13&quot;; he was a distinguished person and notable musician who firmly declared that he can detect by ear that tiny discrepance asserting that the higher figure is slightly greater than 2. I had the comments written by Joaquin Zama&iuml;&iquest;&half;ois in his book titled &quot;Teor&iuml;&iquest;&half;a de la M&iuml;&iquest;&half;sica&quot; and recall that he commented that J. Carrillo directed an orchestra that played pieces using a slightly stretched octave. I also read that J. Z. wrote that Carrillo&iuml;&iquest;&half;s nephew was the mathematician who assisted to him. As far as I recall, the comments refer that J. Carrillo didn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t deduce the discrepant value.</p><p>I missed the group of photocopied pages that contain the comments.</p><p>Obviously, I didn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t try to detect by ear such a true musical octave. Recently, I asked to myself: &iuml;&iquest;&half; what indorses the 2 exactness of the octave?. There might be a scientific reason for asserting that it is really 2 exactly. Probably some institution in this planet has already measured this natural range. &iuml;&iquest;&half;Nobody proved that 2 is the exact musical octave or this range was measured with inapropriated instrumentation / procedures?.</p><p>I examined the progression of musical cells given in my book &quot;The Piagui Musical Scale: Perfecting Harmony&quot; (Author: C. Mario Pizarro). The progression contains 624 frequency steps comprised in the range C = 1 up to cell # 624 that equals to (9/8)^6 = 2.02728652954098. It is a geometrical progression since any cell value equals to the product of the preceding cell multiplied by one of the M, J, U commas (M = Smallest interval or schisma = (32805 / 32768)).</p><p>The first and last groups of 12 cells make a product of 1.01364326477... = Pythagorean comma. What a coincidence.</p><p>The analysis of the progression properties led to the obtainment of the true musical octave. In a few days, (July 16), a grand piano will be tuned and adjusted to this octave.</p><p>Thanks<br/>Mario<br/>Lima, July 09</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, July 09, 2011 1:44 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: The importance of latency</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mario Pizarro&quot; &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Weeks ago I sent information to your personal address regarding the &gt; derived<br/>&gt; true value of the musical octave.

I would imagine the biggest impact<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would come if group delay is non-uniform along the signal chain (which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it probably is), but how do you predict that&apos;ll make an impact?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think that latency should be studied more thoroughly. So far, not much attention has been paid to brain processing. I&apos;ll volunteer for more EEGs focused on specific aspects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve been pretty obsessed with brain processing over here, but I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t seen as of yet a specific role for something like latency to<br/>&gt; play in fundamental frequency estimation.</p><p>I&apos;ve found a study (non official) claiming that the brain already compensates for any delay even before any sound is heard...

Confusing study...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t mention that I&apos;m deaf in one ear, and that even if there&apos;s no brain damage. It has a normal structure for an ambidextrous person.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Latency is most of the time very theoretic, it&apos;s a concept. Few people care to go beyond this (I&apos;m glad this group does) and even fewer care to define in clear terms what periodicity and latency are. It&apos;s a kind of call to arms actually.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The biggest impact would, in my opinion, be what you&apos;re imagining. Now we&apos;ll need practical and comprehensive measurement tools.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you talk about latency, are you literally talking about a<br/>&gt; straight linear delay on the signal? Or are you talking about some<br/>&gt; kind of nonlinear hysteretic memory effect?</p><p>Hybrid kind of. But more NHM.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The addition of latency in and of itself would be a linear process, as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it can be represented by a convolution of the original signal with an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; impulse response that represents the latency (perhaps just an impulse<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a few milliseconds later). Do you claim that something about the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; latency added is nonlinear, or that the auditory system just behaves<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; nonlinearly in general, outside of the latency issue?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not claiming, I only think. To me, the auditory system behaves non-linearly in general, but again, we&apos;ll need more EEGs and fMRIs. If you add the latency issue, it may well change the paradigm, also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure it&apos;s nonlinear pretty much all over the place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, when measuring consonances and hearing beating, we are always fooled by our own brain. The physical event of beating doesn&apos;t match how the brain works.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean by this?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The discussion from which stems this topic was a rough draft, I hadn&apos;t time to develop this much. I&apos;ll be curious to know which are your conceptions of the &quot;soundwave moving at a speed of 343 m/s&quot; (beating) working with &quot;different types of brain wave patterns and their amount in Hz. (brain latency)&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think that beating has anything to do with the speed of<br/>&gt; sound... beating has to do with when two tones are close enough to get<br/>&gt; caught in the same auditory filter in the cochlea.</p><p>Come with me at my next venue as FOH sound engineer. It&apos;s kind of hard to explain how confusing it is to have a signal moving at the speed of light in cables from source to speakers, and getting it back at 343 m/s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could go on and on about fMRI results proving my statement, but I won&apos;t.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Feel free to post them, I&apos;d find it an interesting read.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Will do! Actually I&apos;m still searching for the most relevant published results on this topic.<br/>&gt; &gt; What I really would like to clarify is the notion of &quot;global latency&quot; (applicable to human and non-human) and &quot;brain latency&quot;. Are they the same thing with different names, or really two distinct types of latency, two &quot;languages of latency&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you say latency, do you mean the delay in signal propagation from<br/>&gt; the initial transduction of the signal to the auditory nerve to its<br/>&gt; reception in the auditory midbrain? Or something else?</p><p>First one!</p><p>I think I will just read and learn until I get a really good grasp of things here.<br/>Learning is the main reason why I subscribed to this group...
