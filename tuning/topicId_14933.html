When he was growing up, he<br/>had from an early age heard tones he could not play on his piano in the mountains of Mexico.<br/>Only later in his late teens did he realize about microtones. On investigating further he<br/>realized that much had to be done before he could do the music he wanted to do. He thought<br/>that the best way to cause the music he wanted to hear was not in composing things that<br/>couldn&apos;t be done, but by actualizing  solution to the problems that prevent microtonal music<br/>to come to fruition. He felt such an act could cause far more change in Music than anything<br/>else. The bosanquet keyboard is something he has wanted for 50 years.<br/>    I have had the fortune to be present quite often when He first meets someone. The<br/>conversation always end up centering on what this other person wants to do or is doing, not on<br/>what he is doing. True he will pulls things out that have universal applications if they are<br/>new, but more often than not, he will show them what he has that relates to them. He is always<br/>the one asking the most questions.
