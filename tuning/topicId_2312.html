They just kept it in the scale as some kind of convenient<br/>placeholder?  With such a small number of tones, it would seem that a<br/>musician would be reluctant to give up harmonic opportunities, especially<br/>since it is so close to the 5/3 which some people would say is the next most<br/>harmonious interval after 3/2.  Actually, this and other points you have made<br/>sound like a reiteration of the point I was trying to make which was that the<br/>scale they were using did not describe what they were actually doing, and<br/>that we still suffer from the same problem today with 12et.  Perhaps our<br/>viewpoints are not so dissimilar as would first appear.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>And the 27/16 would not be tuned 5/3 because it would be heard against the<br/>9/8, which would not be tuned 10/9 because it would be heard against the 3/2.<br/>A chain of fifths, i.e., Pythagorean tuning, is clearly the best way to tune<br/>such music.  Sure, vocalists could use both 5/4 and 81/64 in the course of a<br/>piece of music, depending on immediate harmonic context, but if we had to<br/>choose one for these musics, it would certainly be 81/64.  Melodically, also,<br/>the Pythagorean versions of the pentatonic and heptatonic scale are very<br/>smooth and easily learned.</p><p>You can&apos;t take the major third (5/4 or 81/64) and analyze it out of the<br/>context of the rest<br/>of the scale and the type of harmony it is to be used for!<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>With all due respect, you are in no position to tell me what I can or can&apos;t<br/>do.</p><p>I assure you that I have, and routinely use, a variety of tools for analyzing<br/>every possible harmonic relationship in a scale.</p><p>To really describe what&apos;s going on we need a scale with a lot more than five<br/>or seven tones.  It must have both 5/4 and 81/64, as well as a lot of others.<br/> I still find it extremely difficult to believe that the interval 81/64 is<br/>really used, but I since there is currently no way to measure such things,<br/>with sufficient accuracy, we will have to each hold our separate opinions<br/>until technology improves?</p><p>The limitations of the chain of fifths idea have been discussed in this forum<br/>many times.  It seems to me that lattices are just an extension of this<br/>concept and suffer from the same limitations.  These  concepts, a kind of<br/>musical parallelism, are useful, but I find other methods better, especially<br/>in the context of discretely-tuned electronic musical instruments.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>Also, the scales of Pythagorean times had 7, not 5, tones!<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>You are correct, and thank you for reminding me of that.</p><p>While I am grateful for your comments, I find myself still unable to<br/>completely understand your viewpoint, and suspect you may have similar<br/>difficulties with mine.  Let&apos;s not allow these problems to interfere with our<br/>good humor.</p><p>Marion</p></div><h3><a id=2328 href="#2328">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/1999 11:38:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marion wrote,</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; So the 81/64 would not be heard against the 1/1, it would be heard against<br/>&gt; the 27/16, for example.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you saying that it was against the rules to actually use the interval<br/>&gt; 27:16.

There&apos;s plenty of technology that can measure such<br/>things to sufficient accuracy. Unless you mean technology that can analyze music<br/>that was played 1000 years ago, which is of course far more relevant to this<br/>discussion; in that case we need a significant improvement in technology :)</p><p>&gt; The limitations of the chain of fifths idea have been discussed in this forum<br/>&gt; many times.
