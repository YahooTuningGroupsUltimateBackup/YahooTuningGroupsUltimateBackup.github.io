I once was listening to mysterious mountain on the radio at<br/>&gt; work and a co-worker came in and started talking about how this reminded him of when he lived<br/>&gt; on Mt. Shasta. Neither of us knew the piece and were impressed when we heard the title at the<br/>&gt; end. but you are the only one who has mentioned him on this list (glad you did).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Alan Hovhaness.  There, I&apos;ve mentioned him, too.  I first met Hovhaness<br/>in Detroit of all places when I was about 15 years old.  I had gone to<br/>the symphony all by myself and asked Hovhaness for his autograph outside<br/>the concert hall.  He was very startled that someone so young would be<br/>&quot;stalking&quot; him and asking for an autograph.  I was also amazed at the<br/>fact that he was ALWAYS composing, even in a rehearsal, which is what I<br/>happened to see.<br/>__________ ____ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
