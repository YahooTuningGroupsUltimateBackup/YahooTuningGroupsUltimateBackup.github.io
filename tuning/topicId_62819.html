Interestingly, on the cello I found a sequence of harmonic nodes, 3/4-3/5-3/7-3/8-3/10-3/11-3/13-3/14-3/16-3/17-3/19-3/20-3/22 (-3/23-3/25 etc.), which gives a nice octatonic almost-scale (8-10-11-13-14-16-17-19-20). I haven&apos;t found a sequence that gives the 3rd mode yet!<br/>  Interesting you mention Messiaen et al., I commented to Paul privately that Messiaen equated the 12ET tritone with 11.<br/>  BTW last year I attended a talk by Tenney, his theme basically was how the impasse in 20th-c. music resulted from the harmonic saturation of the Scriabinists vs. the tempered scale (the music, though wonderful, was a dead end because 1. the higher identities aren&apos;t adequately represented 2. the 12ET scale keeps being continually exhausted 3. when every harmony has 5-8+ pitches they wind up all being literally the same). A real pleasure when you actually hear someone saying out loud what you&apos;ve been thinking half your life, doesn&apos;t happen to me that often.<br/>  I&apos;ve been very slow giving this more thought (apologies to all), but at least I&apos;ve started a thread! :)<br/>  Chris</p><p>  Message: 2<br/>   Date: Mon, 12 Dec 2005 19:36:03 +0100<br/>   From: Daniel Wolf &lt;<a href="mailto:djwolf@snafu.de">djwolf@snafu.de</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: A JI realisation of Messiaen&apos;s octatonic (was: Schoenberg,<br/>serliasim, 12-edo</p><p>  James Tenney may have been the first to recommend tuning the complete<br/>octatonic up to a harmonic series segment implying octave multiples of<br/>the first seven primes: 1, 17, 19, 5, 11, 3, 13, 7.  While the accuracy<br/>and acceptabilty of this as a substitute for the tempered octatonic is<br/>debatable, this strikes me as especially resonant with the<br/>Skryiabiniste<br/>tradition (microtonalists know Wyschnegradsky, but Lourie, Obuchov, and<br/>- yes - Messiaen ought also be included in this grouping),</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>---------------------------------<br/>Yahoo!
