The recent work with chromatic pairs, subgroup temperaments, MODMOS&apos;s, etc has been pretty valuable. Many insights were made, and much was learned. Unfortunately, it looks like things are now going downhill.</p><p>I generally haven&apos;t moderated much on the list if at all, generally just deleting spammers when they come up and letting the rest happen as it will. But, I&apos;d like to remind everyone that the policy on the lists is to stick to on-topic discussion. This means that we want more discussion about subgroups, MODMOS&apos;s, and hopefully some new stuff as well.</p><p>This means that you will see things discussed that you specifically disagree with. If you see a specific point that you disagree with, feel free to bring it up in reasoned discourse. If you feel that people aren&apos;t seeing things clearly, feel free to make a post clearing up any common misconceptions, as I just did with my recent post on psychoacoustics.</p><p>HOWEVER, the following are things that you cannot do:</p><p>1) Proclaim that you know certain relevant insights about music theory, criticize everyone else for not already knowing them, but not tell anyone what they are.<br/>2) Hijack random threads with magnificent dismissals of everyone&apos;s ideas without providing supporting evidence.<br/>3) Vent your personal frustrations on the list with personal attacks whenever you feel like it.</p><p>We all get carried away sometimes, and I don&apos;t claim to have a perfect record. It is, unfortunately, completely out of control right now. Take it down a notch please.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97350 href="#97350">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2011 8:58:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;battaglia01&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; We are going in circles and it&apos;s now very hard to<br/>&gt; maintain a sense of good humor about all of this.<br/>&gt; You are not going to find the answer that you seek by<br/>&gt; directly asking Carl.
