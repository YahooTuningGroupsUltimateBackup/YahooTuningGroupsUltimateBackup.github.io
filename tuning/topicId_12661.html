I wonder how this would sound.<br/>&gt;&gt; Monz?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It uses exactly the same ratios as my &apos;1st example&apos;, but a comma<br/>&gt; higher, so essentially it would sound the same.</p><p>You&apos;re right!  And that means it&apos;s no good.  I missed that the G<br/>at 81/80 is the tonic, violating my own rule of never putting hate<br/>on the tonic.</p><p>So my recommendations for this sequence are as follows:</p><p>1. For the original score, Monz&apos; 2nd example.</p><p>2. For the &quot;sustained-d&quot; score, distribute the comma evenly across<br/>the 6 changes.  If John&apos;s rigid-spring version turns up anything<br/>other than this, I&apos;ll eat my shoe.  But I reserve the right not to<br/>like it as much as Partch #3, once I&apos;ve heard it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
