Studies in<br/>speech perception have shown cultural influences effective on the<br/>discrimination of infants younger than 6 months.  If you look at some of<br/>Trehub&apos;s recent articles in the psycology journals, I think as people wise<br/>to the ways of tuning theory you&apos;ll agree that her ideas about frequency<br/>ratios are overly simple minded and poorly represent those of use who use<br/>rational ratios to represent musical intervals.</p><p>jason yust</p></div>
