You can view it from<br/><a href="http://windowsmedia.com/mediaguide/middle/movies/moviesalt.asp">http://windowsmedia.com/mediaguide/middle/movies/moviesalt.asp</a>, scroll down<br/>to the <a href="http://CinemaNow.com">CinemaNow.com</a> line and choose your connection speed -- 100k or 300k.<br/>Though WindowsMedia leaves out a lot of the detail (it can&apos;t really keep up<br/>in the very fast parts) and the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired,<br/>even at the higher bandwidth, you can at least get an idea of what it&apos;s<br/>like.</p><p>The piece, Hiway 70, was written in freely modulating JI with Csound. In<br/>fact, the files used to generate it are on the CD-ROM accompanying the<br/>Csound book. The audio was also on the tuning list tape swap some time ago.<br/>If I can be permitted one more act of self-promotion, you can buy the video<br/>(with others) online at <a href="http://www.iotacenter.org/">http://www.iotacenter.org/</a>. The JI network should<br/>be selling it too, but I haven&apos;t seen it on their website.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Truly incredible.  It&apos;s a<br/>great piece, and the video is a wonderful enhancement.  I wonder what<br/>program was used for the video generation.... (??)</p><p>I&apos;ll have to say that I had to use Internet Explorer in order to view<br/>it.  It wouldn&apos;t work under Netscape.  I received an &quot;unknown<br/>error...&quot;  That&apos;s descriptive.  I wonder if this is part of the Bill<br/>Gates cultural hegemony.  And, I was using a &quot;high-speed&quot; cable<br/>modem, which is now in operation...</p><p>What&apos;s with this traffic business??  First Paul Lansky with his<br/>famous NIGHT TRAFFIC, a great piece, and now this!  When people used<br/>to go and ask me to &quot;play in traffic&quot; they had no idea this might be<br/>contributing to my esthetic progress!</p><p>What&apos;s more, Bill Alves has really made it to the &quot;big time&quot; with<br/>CinemaNow.  He&apos;s even right next to their biggest hit &quot;Like to Watch<br/>Love Making?...&quot;  Now, that&apos;s hot.</p><p>________ _____ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
