I&apos;ve never really used this function.  Naturally,<br/>problems with uniqueness in 12 will still be problems, and it treats all<br/>inversions of a chord the same, which can be a big drawback (C6 vs. Am7,<br/>and so on).  If you play more than the bare chord, it confuses the thing.</p><p>The Pitch Palette also has a function that allows the user to choose roots<br/>on the fly, via Midi footpedals, or the lowest octave on your keyboard,<br/>etc.  This is the feature I bought the software for.  However, I ran into<br/>severe limitations trying to use it.  With a Proteus/2, the root changes<br/>simply took too long to be used in any normally-paced piece of music.<br/>Other synths may be faster.  Midi cables are actually a problem here ---<br/>Thomas Langley at Justonic recommended a USB Sound Canvas.</p><p>No external synth, however, is as fast as the Virtual Sound Canvas, which<br/>the Pitch Palette is bundled with.  I used the Pitch Palette&apos;s sequencer to<br/>insert root changes in midi files of my music, and performed them with the<br/>VSC.  The tuning changes still took too long!  The results will again be on<br/>my web page... when it&apos;s back up in August.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=3973 href="#3973">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
