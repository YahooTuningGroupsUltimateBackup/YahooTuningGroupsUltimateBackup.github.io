I found that one of the scales had a<br/>&gt;sequence that exceeded 1200 cents. It was the 3 1 2 1 4 4 2 4 4 Maqam<br/>&gt;Jabburi, which added up to be 150, 200, 300, 350, 550, 750, 850,<br/>&gt;1050, 1250 cents. Is this correct for this scale? All the others<br/>&gt;terminated on 1200 cents.</p><p>3 1 2 1 4 4 2 4 4 is exactly how it appears in Manuel&apos;s table. There must be<br/>an error. Manuel?</p></div>
