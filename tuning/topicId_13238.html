If anyone wants definitive rulings, I can email him and get some links to more authoritative voices.</p><p>    I took Jacky Ekstasis&apos; comments as a somewhat lighthearted tweak. If he was being slyly vicious, then he has been properly swatted. If he hit a sore spot in honest jest, I would say he has been overly vilified. We all know, I think, that we need theorists, musicians, composers, and promoters, but we also need jesters. Many of us have been inadvertently rude from time to time, but let&apos;s be a little forgiving, even while being teased.</p><p>    My post about the tape swap was regarding Denis Atadan&apos;s swap of 1997(?). I offered a cleaned up CD master to anyone willing to undertake distributing it as a CD. If you haven&apos;t heard the tape, maybe you can get someone to make you a copy. There is some cool stuff on it.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
