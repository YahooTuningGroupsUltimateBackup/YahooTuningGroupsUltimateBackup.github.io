That&apos;s the important part.</p><p>For me, it seemed  that he was a little demeaning toward alternate tuning<br/>in his statements -- kind of like it was just &quot;surface messing around&quot;<br/>going on and not necessarily an integral part of the compositional fabric<br/>and structure, determining the nature of events...</p><p>I get a little concerned when people start talking about music &quot;meaning&quot;<br/>something.  It kind of sounds like Richard Strauss and a &quot;programmatic&quot;<br/>approach.  (I love Richard Strauss, though, so it can obviously work<br/>sometimes  -- but there sure are BAD examples of this method...)</p><p>May I humbly suggest using resources right at hand??  Right on this very<br/>list we have some extremely capable composers who are also microtonalists<br/>and who might be willing to assist you in compositional details in a<br/>microtonal context at a reasonable fee, if they have time.  Joe Monzo and<br/>Johnny Reinhard come immediately to mind... although I am certain there are<br/>many, many others here -- I&apos;m just not yet familiar with their work... but<br/>I hope to be.</p><p>Best of luck, and please do &quot;stay tuned&quot;</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
