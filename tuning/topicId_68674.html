Promise.  However,<br/>this extract from a little note I sent to Paul Erlich and Dave Keenan<br/>about sums it up:</p><p>&quot;I wanted you both to know that I was starting over again as a kind<br/>of tabula rasa to find an interesting scale to work with and I looked<br/>at several of the scales in Scala and, quite frankly, *nothing* is as<br/>interesting for me right now as Blackjack, so it was well worth the<br/>time it took constructing it.</p><p>Smaller oriental scales are, well, too small and, for me, too<br/>oriental... :)  Partch&apos;s scales are *huge* and interesting, but<br/>mostly always sound chromatic, since it&apos;s hard to manipulate the<br/>notes otherwise.  The Bohlen-Pierce scale is *very* interesting, but<br/>I miss the octave.  I&apos;m sure I would need that sometime.</p><p>I&apos;m just getting the right combination of harmonic consonance with<br/>xenharmonic-sounding small intervals with Blackjack, aside from the<br/>fact that I know what all the notes actually *are* with a keyboard<br/>marked with Sagittal-Wilson.&quot;</p><p>Of course, Paul&apos;s response, as I had anticipated, was that there were<br/>*lots* of other scales to explore.  I&apos;m sure he&apos;s right on that, but<br/>I really have two hands full just with Blackjack at the moment, so<br/>I&apos;m discovering...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2007 11:33:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Way to go!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2007 12:46:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, Blackjack is an excellent tuning so there you go. :-) There<br/>absolutely MUST be people concentrating on specific tunings,<br/>if &quot;alternative tuning&quot;, aka &quot;actually making music&quot; is to be heard<br/>outside of remote conclaves.</p><p>IMO the first 30 seconds of your piece &quot;Blacklight&quot; is evidence enough<br/>that it&apos;s a tuning worth spending a lifetime on.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2007 12:49:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, Blackjack is an excellent tuning so there you go. :-) There<br/>&gt; absolutely MUST be people concentrating on specific tunings,<br/>&gt; if &quot;alternative tuning&quot;, aka &quot;actually making music&quot; is to be heard<br/>&gt; outside of remote conclaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IMO the first 30 seconds of your piece &quot;Blacklight&quot; is evidence<br/>enough<br/>&gt; that it&apos;s a tuning worth spending a lifetime on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thanks so much for the positive commentary!</p><p>JP</p></div>
