 the genius of this piece is that<br/>Yes used a usual diatonic tuning conception and found<br/>a way to work this drift in in a brilliant way!</p><p>it&apos;s very typical in late-1960s-early-1970s rock music<br/>to find a chord progression that goes I-bVII-IV-V,<br/>playing on the mixolydian modality (minor-7th degree<br/>with major-3rd) characteristic of much rock.  in this<br/>progression, the minor-7th of the tonic becomes the<br/>root of the bVII chord, then at the end the V chord<br/>has the major-7th as a leading tone, at which point<br/>the progression repeats.  it&apos;s interesting because in<br/>a way it&apos;s polytonal: the I-bVII-IV can be reinterpreted<br/>as V-IV-I in the key of IV, then when, in the key of IV,<br/>that I goes to a II#3, that progression IV: I-II#3 becomes<br/>reinterpreted as I: IV-V.  so the whole structure with<br/>the double interpreteation looks like:</p><p>   I:   I - bVII - IV - V<br/>   IV:  V -  IV  -  I - II#3</p><p>so the really brilliant move that Yes made was to<br/>extend the progression with a &quot;prequel&quot;, putting<br/>another chord another &quot;whole-step&quot; higher before<br/>the first chord in the above example I: I = IV: V.</p><p>by having this &quot;extra&quot; chord at the beginning, causing<br/>the whole progression to slide down an extra &quot;tone&quot;,<br/>they ended up with a V-I at the end that brings the<br/>next repetition into a new key a &quot;tone&quot; lower than<br/>the last time around, so that there are four different<br/>tonalities all being implied at different parts of<br/>the progression, and then those four keep rotating<br/>downward each time it&apos;s repeated:</p><p>   I:      I   - bVII - bVI  - bIII -  IV  |<br/>   bVII:   ... -  I   - bVII -  IV  -  V   | I:      I   - bVII  etc.<br/>   IV:     V   -  IV  ...                  | bVII:   ... -  I<br/>   bIII:   ... -  V   -  IV  -  I   - II#3 | IV:     V   -  IV<br/>                                           | bIII:   ... -  V</p><p>&gt; gene looked a little bit at these weird temperaments<br/>&gt; on tuning-math . . .</p><p>i must have missed that while i was on &quot;tuning vacation&quot; ...</p><p>-monz<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=40330 href="#40330">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2002 7:20:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_40321.html#40321">/tuning/topicId_40321.html#40321</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s very typical in late-1960s-early-1970s rock music<br/>&gt; to find a chord progression that goes I-bVII-IV-V,<br/>&gt; playing on the mixolydian modality (minor-7th degree<br/>&gt; with major-3rd) characteristic of much rock.</p><p>***You know, as a *pianist* I never quite understood why this was...</p><p>However, after spending more time with the *guitar* of late, I can<br/>see the, apparently, the derivation comes from the easy *parallel*<br/>nature of major chords, in fact *any* chords on the guitar...</p><p>(Slightly OT)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=40335 href="#40335">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/29/2002 8:08:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/29/02 8:17:21 AM Central Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; I:      I   - bVII - bVI  - bIII -  IV  |<br/>&gt;    bVII:   ... -  I   - bVII -  IV  -  V   | I:      I   - bVII  etc.<br/>&gt;    IV:     V   -  IV  ...                  | bVII:   ... -  I<br/>&gt;    bIII:   ... -  V   -  IV  -  I   - II#3 | IV:     V   -  IV<br/>&gt;                                            | bIII:   ... -  V<br/>&gt;<br/>monz.</p><p>Many common hymns have unusual chord sequences.
