For example, choose 0-<br/>273-655 cents in 22tet. Map this chord to C-E-G. This produces C=0,<br/>E=273 and G=655cents. It now naturally follows that F-A-C becomes 545-<br/>818-1200 cents, G-B-D becomes 655-927-109 cents, E-G#-B becomes 273-545-<br/>927 cents, A-C#-E becomes 818-1091-273 cents, B-D#-F# becomes 927-0-382<br/>cents, Ab-C-Eb becomes 545-0-0 cents, Db-F-Ab becomes 1091-545-545<br/>cents and Eb-G-Bb becomes 0-655-655 cents. The tuning of the Kurzweil<br/>(or similar) now is: C=0, C#=1091, D=109, Eb=0, E=273, F=545, F#=382,<br/>G=655, Ab=545, A=818, Bb=655, and B=927. Classical piano midi files<br/>with a vibraphone timbre sound quite good when used with this musical<br/>algorithm which can be used to explore or just to have fun.</p></div>
