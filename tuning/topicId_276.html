It<br/>&gt;sure would be great if we could actually *hear* these different tunings<br/>&gt;rather<br/>&gt;than just spouting numbers at each other.  So, one of us could have a<br/>&gt;two-second audio clip of, say, an authentic cadence in quarter-comma<br/>&gt;meantone,<br/>&gt;and another two-second clip of that same cadence in third-comma<br/>&gt;meantone.      &gt; &gt;</p><p>MIDI works quite well for that sort of thing as long as the patch is pipe<br/>organ, which is vibratoless on all the soundcards I&apos;ve heard but one.<br/>Also, if one were to set up a newsgroup alt.binaries.music.microtonal<br/>there is nothing to keep anyone away. I think it would be a great thing.<br/>You could post pictures, MIDI, audio of any format you desire. I am<br/>impressed with Real Audio&apos;s latest release. Real Audio encoder<br/>and player are still free, you just have to search the Real Audio website<br/>with a magnifying glass. Also, free websites are available from many<br/>companies, and most come with at least 2M free disk space, I believe.<br/>It should be simple for almost anyone to offer samples of their audio to<br/>those for whom web access is not a problem.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</a></p></div>
