Well, I guess the &quot;Internet<br/>Idealism&quot; phase is over.  Frankly, I&apos;m surprised that banner ads<br/>accounted for much of anything at all.  Personally, I only *glance*<br/>at them...

Now there is only _X-Drive_ which is a subscription<br/>service (not *too* expensive, though...)</p><p>We&apos;ll have to keep trying or figure out something else...

Nonetheless, it *is* a<br/>dumb idea *if* the only reason for using it is that the files area<br/>here is full.
