It has a ratio<br/>of 16:21:24:28 (a rounded 0-471-702-969 cents). Using a notation where<br/>C4 represents middle C, and &quot;v&quot; shows a note a septimal comma (64:63,<br/>~27.26 cents) lower than the usual Pythagorean step, here&apos;s the<br/>progression:</p><p>           Fv4    E4<br/>           D4     E4<br/>           Cv4    A3<br/>           G3     A3</p><p>In this kind of style, called &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; because of its derivation<br/>from the music of Gothic Europe during the 13th-14th centuries, a<br/>minor seventh often contracts to a stable fifth, and this happens here<br/>between the outer voices.</p><p>As Keenan Pepper pointed out, the opening unstable sonority includes<br/>a narrow fourth at 21:16 (G3-Cv4), a septimal comma narrower than 4:3;<br/>he described this interval as &quot;crunchy.&quot;</p><p>At least in some timbres, I tend to find the overall effect of this<br/>sonority on the concordant side: the usual fifths and fourths, pure in<br/>this tuning, seem to provide a space which the narrow fourth can fill<br/>with energy or &quot;illumine.&quot; It seems almost like a music of<br/>interstellar space.</p><p>These were my impressions when I tried this progression in what I call<br/>the Sesquisexta tuning; _sesquisexta_ is a medieval Latin name for the<br/>ratio of 7:6, and in this tuning defines the interval of a 7:6 minor<br/>third between two 12-note manuals in a standard Pythagorean tuning<br/>(Eb-G#).</p><p>Curiously, the visual layout of the progression in Sesquisexta is as<br/>follows, using a curly brace &quot;}&quot; to show a note on the upper keyboard,<br/>a 7:6 (~266.87 cents) higher than its usual Pythagorean counterpart:</p><p>        D}4   E4<br/>        D4    E4<br/>        A}3   A3<br/>        G3    A3</p><p>The descending semitone Fv4-E4 -- or D}4-E4 as played on the keyboard<br/>-- lends the progression some of its flavor, and has a size of 28:27<br/>(~62.96 cents), a very nice cadential semitone (or, some would say,<br/>&quot;thirdtone&quot;).</p><p>Here&apos;s the same Keenan Pepper sonority with a different resolution,<br/>this time involving ascending rather than descending melodic<br/>semitone, again by a 28:27 &quot;thirdtone&quot;:</p><p>              <a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesen003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesen003.mid</a></p><p>Using the above notations, we have:</p><p>        Fv4   Ebv4                        D}4   C}4<br/>        D4    Ebv4                        D4    C}4<br/>        Cv4   Abv3                        A}3   F}3<br/>        G3    Abv3             or         G3    F}3</p><p>The lowest voice ascends G3-Abv3, and the next-to-highest ascends<br/>D4-Ebv4, while the other two voices proceed in contrary motion.</p><p>At least in the synthesizer timbre I used, the preset &quot;Puff Pipes&quot;<br/>(voice A56) on a Yamaha TX-802, this type of progression has a kind of<br/>energetic and engaging concord which I really like.</p><p>Please let me add, Gordon, that while your mention of the &quot;Just&quot; led<br/>me to post examples in JI, I also warmly support your suggestion that<br/>dialogue can partake of the equitable and the friendly on a basic<br/>human level also.</p><p>Again, welcome to our forum.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2001 1:22:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As Keenan Pepper pointed out, the opening unstable sonority includes<br/>&gt; a narrow fourth at 21:16 (G3-Cv4), a septimal comma narrower than<br/>4:3;<br/>&gt; he described this interval as &quot;crunchy.&quot;</p><p>A small correction . . . he didn&apos;t describe this interval as crunchy,<br/>he described the whole tetrad as crunchy.

I<br/>also wonder if a chord with a root, a perfect fifth and both a major<br/>and minor third, is in some sense the simplest crunchy tetrad, and the<br/>_most_ crunchy by Keenan Pepper&apos;s definition?</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Gordon Rumson &#x3C;RUMSONG@CADVISION.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2001 9:10:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Greetings,</p><p>Thanks VERY much for your message and greeting.</p><p>So well written, so informative.  You are a marvel of erudition.  I&apos;ve read<br/>your posts (recent and in the past off the mills list I think) with<br/>amazement.  Brilliant.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in the neo Gothic tuning in part because I have a medieval<br/>project I&apos;d like to provide a striking sound for.  I will investigate<br/>further, but please forgive me as I am slow of mind by nature and short of<br/>time by circumstance.  But if I come to understand it and it fits the<br/>project, then I might come sit at your feet and learn what I can.  That is<br/>NOT meant in a derogatory fashion.  I&apos;m on this list to learn what I can and<br/>you know a HUGE amount and are strikingly willing to share.</p><p>My reference to Just had more to do with justice than a tuning scheme per<br/>se.  In all honesty I am not and for personal reasons can never be an<br/>adherent of any one tuning scheme (sorry to all who might be offended by<br/>that, though I expect no one will be really).</p><p>But I am also aware that tuning is something we need to live with in order<br/>to come to terms with its characteristics and there will be a limited number<br/>of schemes we can really absorb.

(I latter<br/>started using a 9 out of 20 bimodal scale as one possible microtonal<br/>extension of Ubieta&apos;s ideas.)</p><p>Ubieta is an accomplished composer with a beautiful feel for guitar<br/>compositions.

As you&apos;ll see, I warmly embrace the<br/>substance of this correction, with a small friendly emendation.</p><p>In addition to very rightly focusing our attention on what Keenan<br/>Pepper himself did and did not say about the concept of &quot;crunchiness,&quot;<br/>your remarks have given me the opportunity to consider and clarify<br/>some evident differences between Pepper&apos;s perception of this sonority<br/>and mine.</p><p>First, please let me accept the correction you both offer than Keenan<br/>Pepper indeed refers to 16:21:24:28 as a &quot;crunchy&quot; sonority, but does<br/>not use this term _specifically_ for the narrow fourth at 21:16.</p><p>While as you note, Paul, this may be a &quot;small correction,&quot; it&apos;s a<br/>significant one: someone reading my article might get the idea that<br/>Pepper&apos;s concept of &quot;crunchiness&quot; focuses especially on 21:16 or its<br/>qualities as a simple interval.</p><p>In fact, as you both very aptly sum up, Pepper&apos;s crunchiness is<br/>primarily a property of sonorities such as 16:21:24:28 where a single<br/>interval is deemed, ideally, to contribute more dissonance than all of<br/>the others combined.</p><p>To show how well-taken this general point of emphasis and focus is,<br/>Paul and Dave, I&apos;m including a link to Keenan Pepper&apos;s original post<br/>of 27 August 2000:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11922">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11922</a></p><p>Now we come to my friendly emendation. While Pepper does not<br/>_specifically_ refer to 21:16 as a &quot;crunchy interval,&quot; he does more<br/>generally sanction this usage by using the term &quot;crunchy&quot; for either a<br/>sonority as a whole, or its most tense or dissonant interval:</p><p>&gt; My goal is to find a cruchy chord in which the harmonic entropy of<br/>&gt; the crunchy interval is more than the sum of all the other entropies<br/>&gt; combined.  Such a chord would be as crunchy as ice cold raw green<br/>&gt; pepper, proven to be the most crunchy food.</p><p>Thus we might indeed refer to 16:21:24:28 as a &quot;crunchy chord&quot; or<br/>sonority, and also the 21:16 narrow fourth as a &quot;crunchy interval,&quot;<br/>while following the original Pepperian usage.</p><p>However, I enthusiastically embrace the substance of your correction:<br/>especially for readers who may not already be familiar with Pepper&apos;s<br/>elegant presentation, to illustrate the concept of &quot;crunchiness&quot; by<br/>giving as a first example a simple interval such as 21:16 is to<br/>confuse rather than clarify this concept.</p><p>Now we come to the more subjective side of this discussion:<br/>considering your remarks has led me to the conclusion that my emphasis<br/>on the 21:16 narrow fourth itself may reflect my own musical viewpoint<br/>rather than Pepper&apos;s.</p><p>To me, while this type of fourth is indeed intensely dissonant in many<br/>timbres -- the term &quot;Wolf&quot; is not too much of an exaggeration of the<br/>effect of those &quot;howling&quot; beats -- it can be more or less concordant<br/>in others. For example, I&apos;ve attempted in a vibraphone-like timbre to<br/>use 9/23 octave (~469.57 cents) as a stable fourth, and succeded at<br/>least in part as judged by my own ear.</p><p>This kind of experiment might be taken to support a &quot;semi-Setharean&quot;<br/>interpretation of a familiar proverb: &quot;You _can_ make a silk purse<br/>from a sow&apos;s ear -- if the ear happens to belong to the listener.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, I warmly agree that in Pepper&apos;s presentation, the most<br/>relevant thing about 21:16 is that it is &quot;quite dissonant,&quot; to quote<br/>his words, in contrast to my interest in &quot;Sethareanizing&quot; it.</p><p>Also, in discussing the overall effect of 16:21:24:28, Pepper remarks<br/>that the 21:16 is &quot;quite dissonant, giving this chord the melancholy<br/>sound common to all crunchy chords.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, I find this sonority spacious, energetic, radiant, like<br/>an expanse of interstellar space filled with illumination.</p><p>Could these different impressions reflect the variable of timbre, or<br/>other factors?</p><p>Anyway, having accepted a very helpful correction and considered these<br/>different responses to a beautiful sonority, I would like to conclude<br/>by agreeing with Dave Keenan that a sonority such as 20:24:25:30<br/>(e.g. C4-Eb4-E4-G4 in 5-limit just intonation, with C4 as middle C)<br/>might be an ideal example of &quot;crunchiness.&quot;</p><p>Here we have a pure 3:2 fifth (C4-G4), two pure 5:4 major thirds<br/>(C4-E4, Eb4-G4), and two pure 6:5 minor thirds (C4-Eb4, E4-G4) -- plus<br/>an outstandingly dissonant 25:24 chromatic semitone (Eb4-E4).</p><p>While the use of such sonorities in &quot;Blues-like&quot; styles has sometimes<br/>been interpreted as an effort to approximate a neutral third by<br/>sounding both major and minor forms of this interval at the same time,<br/>&quot;crunchiness&quot; is an attractive alternative explanation, and would fit<br/>Pepper&apos;s suggested &quot;melancholy&quot; quality for crunchy sonorities.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@aracnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2001 8:56:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gordon Rumson &lt;RUMSONG@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Has it ever occurred to anyone that the reason government funded<br/>schools do<br/>&gt; not function well is that it is in the government&sup1;s interest not to<br/>have an<br/>&gt; intelligent electorate?&quot;  A question by Gordon Rumson...</p><p>Sorry for posting a non-tuning reply here, but I just *can&apos;t* let<br/>this howler go by without expressing my strong disapproval.
