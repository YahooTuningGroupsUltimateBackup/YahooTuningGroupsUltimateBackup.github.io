Other metal songs<br/>with prominent tritones in their main riffs are Diamond Head&apos;s Am I<br/>Evil? and Metallica&apos;s For Whom the Bell Tolls and Enter Sandman.<br/>Perhaps the single guitarist to have made the most extensive use of<br/>the tritone is Robert Fripp of King Crimson, who used it repeatedly in<br/>King Crimson albums like Larks&apos; Tongues in Aspic, Starless and Bible<br/>Black, and Red. Other examples are the beginning of Liszt&apos;s Dante<br/>Sonata, Sibelius&apos;s Fourth Symphony and Jimi Hendrix&apos;s Purple Haze. The<br/>tritone is also used throughout Benjamin Britten&apos;s War Requiem, as an<br/>ironic &quot;point of reference&quot; despite the tone&apos;s inherent instability,<br/>thereby offering subtle commentary on the nature of war itself. Slayer<br/>has traditionally used the tritone extensively, and their 1998 album<br/>titled &quot;Diabolus in Musica&quot;, reflects that fact.&quot;</p><p>I got very tired of the interval when it was introduced in theory<br/>classes, but I&apos;ve always like the use of the tritone as an integral<br/>part of Lutoslawski&apos;s &quot;Funeral Music&quot; for string orchestra.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2005 9:46:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I can&apos;t dig out any reference right now, but i&apos;m certain<br/>&gt; that the &quot;diabolus in musica&quot; concept existed during the<br/>&gt; time of monophonic chant, and was employed in regard to<br/>&gt; melodic steps of an augmented-4th or diminished-5th in<br/>&gt; a chant melody.</p><p>Indeed so: it was primarily a *melodic* thing being forbidden, and<br/>having nothing to do one way or another with harmony.</p><p>A characteristically funny remark about it, in the _Webster&apos;s New<br/>World Dictionary of Music_ (a remake expanding Nicolas Slonimsky&apos;s<br/>_Lectionary of Music_):</p><p>&quot;The earliest suggestion that the use of the tritone may not be a<br/>_peccatum mortale_ was made by Ramos de Pareja in _Musica practica_<br/>(1482), but his leniency received little approbation.&quot;</p><p>Slonimsky&apos;s own book didn&apos;t have that sentence about Ramos, or indeed<br/>the half of the article that this is in.

From Wikipedia:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The tritone retains its &quot;Devil in Music&quot; character in<br/>&gt; popular music, specifically heavy metal. The opening of<br/>&gt; Black Sabbath&apos;s signature song Black Sabbath makes heavy<br/>&gt; use of the tritone. Other metal songs with prominent<br/>&gt; tritones in their main riffs are Diamond Head&apos;s Am I Evil?<br/>&gt; and Metallica&apos;s For Whom the Bell Tolls and Enter Sandman.<br/>&gt; Perhaps the single guitarist to have made the most extensive<br/>&gt; use of the tritone is Robert Fripp of King Crimson, who<br/>&gt; used it repeatedly in King Crimson albums like Larks&apos;<br/>&gt; Tongues in Aspic, Starless and Bible Black, and Red.<br/>&gt; Other examples are the beginning of Liszt&apos;s Dante Sonata,<br/>&gt; Sibelius&apos;s Fourth Symphony and Jimi Hendrix&apos;s Purple Haze.<br/>&gt; The tritone is also used throughout Benjamin Britten&apos;s<br/>&gt; War Requiem, as an ironic &quot;point of reference&quot; despite<br/>&gt; the tone&apos;s inherent instability, thereby offering subtle<br/>&gt; commentary on the nature of war itself. Slayer has<br/>&gt; traditionally used the tritone extensively, and their<br/>&gt; 1998 album titled &quot;Diabolus in Musica&quot;, reflects that<br/>&gt; fact.&quot;</p><p>The Wikipedia article also ought to mention the use of<br/>the tritone in hardcore rap from the 1980s, like<br/>Public Enemy&apos;s _It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold<br/>Us Back_.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2005 2:11:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; And jazz with its tritones is good christian music while rock<br/>with its<br/>&gt; &gt; power chords is satanic?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jazz useage isn&apos;t so much in terms of melodic material (though it<br/>must<br/>&gt; exist) but uses the interval in altered chords and as a modulatory<br/>&gt; tool, and basically as a _musical_ device.</p><p>In a sense this is true of classical music as well. I hear the<br/>tritone a bit more as part of the normal harmonic texture in jazz<br/>than in classical music. In classical music, the tritone occurs as<br/>part of the dominant seventh (and half-diminshed seventh, and<br/>diminished seventh) chord, serves as the characteristic dissonance<br/>and sets up a strong resolution (which the composer may thwart, of<br/>course) to a (possibly fleeting) tonic triad (thus defining tonality<br/>itself and restricting the possible choices of mode relative to the<br/>pre-tritone practice). Resolution doesn&apos;t occur until one arrives at<br/>a sonority without a tritone. In jazz, however, chords are commonly<br/>extended to 5, 6, or 7 notes, and typical chord voicings include<br/>stacks of (mixed perfect and augmented) fourths. It&apos;s even common to<br/>have chords with *two* tritones; for example a G13#9 chord or G(-D)-B-<br/>F-A#-E. Some jazz chords contain a tritone over the *root*,<br/>designated a #11 or b5 -- maybe this is specifically what Jon was<br/>thinking about. And bluesy jazz often resolves on &quot;tonics&quot; which<br/>would be considered &quot;dominant sevenths&quot; or &quot;dominant ninths&quot;<br/>classically speaking, thus still containing a tritone. Still, much<br/>jazz does seem to have some classical harmonic/tonal forces at its<br/>core and departs from and settles down on chords with no tritone, for<br/>example like Cmaj13 (C(-G)-B-E-A-D), Cminmaj9 (C(-G)-Eb-B-D), and<br/>Cm11 (C(-G)-Eb-F-Bb-D). Then again, extension of these chords which<br/>*do* contain a tritone, like Cmaj13#11 (C(-G)-B-E-A-D-F#) and Cm13 (C<br/>(-G)-Bb-Eb-F-A-D), are often used as jazz piece endings, again<br/>flouting the classical conventions in a beautiful way.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2005 3:12:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Apologies for snipping out so many selective parts of<br/>what i quoted from you, but i did it to make the lead-in<br/>to my response clearer.
