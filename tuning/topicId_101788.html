What criteria is he using?</p><p> #1. Before I myself can clearly stick to a particular way of filtering at all, I think I would welcome an explanation why a temperament like quartonic is mostly viewed as a 7-limit one, even though I would suppose it to make more sense in the 5-limit context (with 11 generators for a 4/3 and 18 for an 8/5). Mapping the 8/7 by 5 generators sounds to me like an &quot;addition for somehow making the full 9-limit chord possible&quot; and makes the whole thing recognizably more mistuned than in the 5-limit.</p><p> #2. BTW: One page on the Xenwiki describes the &quot;quartonic temperament&quot; as the one I&apos;ve just mentioned, another talks about &quot;quartonic temperaments&quot; in context of tempering out 36/35. Isn&apos;t there some ambiguity there?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2011 11:04:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   #2.

I was actually looking for a description of &quot;quartonic&quot; (that is, <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=26+27&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=26+27&limit=7</a> ) on the wiki the other day and couldn&apos;t find any.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
