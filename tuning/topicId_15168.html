I hope there is more of this to come.</p><p>3) And, suddenly, even sound enhancements of Margo Schulter&apos;s work by<br/>Robert Walker!</p><p>You know, it occurs to me that we are participating in an amazing<br/>&quot;real time&quot; art event here.  It&apos;s a little like a INTERACTIVE museum<br/>unfolding!</p><p>It seems like the list is presently more &quot;multimedia&quot; than ever!</p><p>________ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
