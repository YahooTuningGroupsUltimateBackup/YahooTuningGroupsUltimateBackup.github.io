I&apos;m still not clear on what exactly<br/>&gt;makes a scale &quot;proper,&quot; but, as he says, both pelog and slendro encompass a<br/>&gt;variety of scales. These &quot;scales&quot; can vary considerably from one set of<br/>&gt;instruments to another, so it&apos;s difficult to make sweeping generalizations.</p><p>Yes- while I do believe that Rothenberg was really on to something<br/>important, I&apos;m aware of the kind of mistakes that were made in<br/>ethnomusicology around the time of his writing the papers, so I&apos;m very<br/>interested in checking out this and his many other cross-cultural claims.</p><p>As far as understanding propriety, did you catch the original discussion on<br/>it this past fall?  It was Chalmers&apos; article in Xenharmonikon 3 that turned<br/>me on to the whole business, and I think it explains the basics of the<br/>model very well.  If you can&apos;t get to it, I&apos;ll give it another shot on the<br/>list.</p><p>This Rothenberg stuff is definitely the heaviest music theory I&apos;ve ever<br/>approached.  That&apos;s why I published some here, and offered to send copies<br/>out --- to get help.  Aside from what I&apos;ve tried to cover so far, he has<br/>stuff about graph efficiency (and node-minimal sets) that tries to explain<br/>the use of altered tones (micro-chromaticism) and scale subsetting.  Way<br/>over my head.</p><p>&gt;Kunst 1949 and Hood 1966 give some tuning data for certain gamelan. In his<br/>&gt;pioneering ethnomusicological study of many aspects of Javanese music (not<br/>&gt;just tuning), Kunst gives just the middle octave of a single instrument of<br/>&gt;a select number of gamelan. Hood (his student) found this approach<br/>&gt;insufficient because of the stretching and compression of octaves. That&apos;s<br/>&gt;mainly what his 1966 article is about. The 1954 book (basically his<br/>&gt;dissertation) is mostly an empirical study of how melodic formulae help<br/>&gt;define the patet (roughly, &quot;modes&quot;) of Javanese music. However, the largest<br/>&gt;set empirical data of gamelan tunings is in:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Surjodiningrat, Wasisto, P. J. Sudarjana, and Adhi Susanto. Penjelidikan<br/>&gt;dalam pengukuran nada gamelan-gamelan djawa terkemuka di Jogjakarta dan<br/>&gt;Surakarta. Yogyakarta: Gadjah Mada University Press; translated by the<br/>&gt;authors as: Tone measurements of outstanding Javanese Gamelan. Yogyakarta:<br/>&gt;Gadjah Mada University Press, 1969, rpt. 1972, 1993.</p><p>Thanks for the reference!  If the rest of Rothenberg&apos;s measures can be<br/>incorporated into Scala, we can try to check the predictions of his model<br/>ourselves!</p><p>&gt;One schema into which pelog tunings have been forced is that they are<br/>&gt;tempered versions of a subset of 9TET. I have seen this hypothesis,<br/>&gt;together with a kind of cycle of &quot;fifths,&quot; proposed by both Javanese and<br/>&gt;Western writers. Dan Wolf had some very interesting speculations along<br/>&gt;these lines in a Xenharmonikon article, though I remain skeptical about the<br/>&gt;9TET connection.</p><p>What do you think of Sethares&apos; results about Javanese scales minimizing<br/>roughness, given the timbres of their instruments?</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>7/29/1999 1:47:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;As far as understanding propriety, did you catch the original discussion on<br/>&gt;it this past fall?  It was Chalmers&apos; article in Xenharmonikon 3</p><p>Yes, I recall now. In reference to slendro and pelog, &quot;propriety&quot; seems to<br/>restate the rather uninteresting (though musically important) observation<br/>that one scale has steps roughly the same size while the other has steps of<br/>very different sizes. Clearly, all slendro scales are proper.</p><p>With pelog, the picture is more complicated. If one takes pelog as a<br/>heptatonic scale, then a quick glance at the Surjodiningrat reference I<br/>gave earlier shows that only one of the 30 or so pelog gamelan they<br/>measured seems to be proper (gamelan Udanaram of the Mangkunegaran palace<br/>in Solo -- the scale in cents is: 140 124 249 165 108 176 255 -- I&apos;m not<br/>running Scala, I&apos;m just adding up seconds and thirds in my head, so I could<br/>be wrong.) In most gamelan, the interval between pitches 4 and 6 is<br/>narrower than the interval between pitches 3 and 4 or 7 and 1.</p><p>However, pelog is really only used in 2 pentatonic subsets (12356 and<br/>23567), with the occassional addition of pitch 4. Those scales are clearly<br/>improper in all instances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What do you think of Sethares&apos; results about Javanese scales minimizing<br/>&gt;roughness, given the timbres of their instruments?<br/>&gt;<br/>I *still* haven&apos;t read his book, so I can&apos;t comment directly. It is an<br/>interesting idea and timbre could play a role. However, I would make<br/>several cautionary statements to those who wanted to pursue this<br/>hypothesis. First, as I pointed out before, specific instances of slendro<br/>and pelog differ considerably, even among gamelan that seem to me to have<br/>pretty much identical timbres. Secondly, tuners use the gender barung as<br/>their tuning reference, which, after the initial attack, has a relatively<br/>pure spectrum, certainly not as inharmonic as, say, the saron. Third, the<br/>tuners themselves cite various musical desiderata as guiding their tuning,<br/>so timbre can&apos;t be the whole story (though I&apos;m not saying that Sethares<br/>says it is).</p><p>&gt;From: Rick Sanford &lt;<a href="mailto:rsanf@pais.org">rsanf@pais.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Bill Alves wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Though slendro approaches 5TET, very closely in some cases, the differences<br/>&gt;&gt; are very deliberate and give each version of slendro a different quality.<br/>&gt;&gt; Tuners and musicians describe these qualities as favoring one patet over<br/>&gt;&gt; another, thus suggesting that the tunings are being tempered in various<br/>&gt;&gt; ways to favor (or flavor) different modes, much as irregular temperaments<br/>&gt;&gt; of the European Baroque favored different keys to a greater or lesser<br/>&gt;&gt; degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Bill:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll buy it.  Can you please list some references discussing<br/>&gt;the approaches to Slendro tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>I wish I could. I had heard at one point that there was a dissertation in<br/>the works along these lines, but I haven&apos;t heard anything more about it.<br/>Hood in his 1966 article discusses some evidence about the importance of<br/>small deviations affecting the characters of different slendros. Lou<br/>Harrison in &quot;Thoughts about &apos;Slippery Slendro&apos;&quot; (_Selected Reports in<br/>Ethnomusicology_ 6 (1985) 111-17) reports some interesting discussions with<br/>Pak Coko about the different character of some slendro tunings. My own<br/>observations above about different slendros favoring different patets come<br/>from a variety of informal conversations with tuners and musicians. I would<br/>love to be able to go back to Java someday and study these differences in a<br/>deeper and more systematic way.</p><p>From: Johnny Reinhard</p><p>&gt;I had the opportunity to question Mantle Hood following a lecture in<br/>&gt;ethnomusicology at Columbia University.  He said there were as many as 19<br/>&gt;tones in Indonesian music.  Slendro (5) and pelog (7) ...do they share a<br/>&gt;common tone?...and various vocal/kemanche tones which can be independent of<br/>&gt;the ideophone instruments.</p><p>There is normally one common tone, or tumbuk, between a set of slendro and<br/>pelog instruments, but in some sets there are two tumbuk tones. (According<br/>to Surjodiningrat et al, there is even one with three tumbuk tones,<br/>Sadadpengasih, owned by radio station RRI Yogyakarta.) I have read several<br/>theories about the pitches outside of the (idiophone) tuning system that<br/>are interpolated by singers in a few very special contexts. This device is<br/>called barang miring (lit. &quot;slanting thing&quot;) or laras miring (lit.<br/>&quot;slanting tuning&quot;).</p><p>Some writers call barang miring pitches pelog pitches interpolated into<br/>slendro (barang miring is only used in slendro). Martopangrawit has<br/>classified the possible barang miring pitches used into 3 scales he called<br/>&quot;minor&quot; scales, each with two or three altered pitches, though one of the<br/>scales was fairly rare. He seemed to have thought of barang miring as a<br/>kind of &quot;polymodality&quot; -- that is, the superimposition of one scale on<br/>another as a special effect. Each of these scales would be transposed for<br/>different patet. Suryabrata notes that in the town of Semarang there is<br/>sometimes a miring-like interpolation between slendro 1 and 2, which he<br/>attributes to Arab influence.</p><p>Mantle Hood&apos;s comments should not be taken as evidence that he thought that<br/>all gamelan and vocal pitches could be aggregated into a kind of Javanese<br/>Greater Perfect System, though his reminder that we shouldn&apos;t neglect the<br/>vocal basis of most gamelan music when studying its tuning is well taken.<br/>There was an interesting discussion on the gamelan list some time back<br/>about the tuning of macapat and other a cappella vocal chants, but from<br/>what I read, more work needs to be done in that area to draw many<br/>meaningful conclusions.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
