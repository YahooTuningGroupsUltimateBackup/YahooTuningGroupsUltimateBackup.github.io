And<br/>while falling asleep (I switched he lights out, when I awoke during the<br/>night), I glanced at the Cent value of that ratio, which is 737.65 Cent.<br/>That number gave a certain deja-vu feeling (now, who could possibly<br/>speak against the use of Cents ...).</p><p>When I awoke next morning (31st Jan. 2006), the first thought<br/>basically jumping to my mind was &quot;Of course, that is the meantone wolf&quot;<br/>in standard quarter-comma meantone temperament, or the diminuished sixth<br/>G#-Eb of 737.63 Cent.</p><p>And I immediately I thought, that it must be easily possible to base a<br/>very simple tuning method on this interval: Namely, to tune all<br/>intervals of quarter-comma meantone without actively tempering any of<br/>intervals and avoiding the somewhat tempered fifth of that temperament<br/>in the tuning process.</p><p>The basic idea was easily set:<br/>If the wolf &quot;fifth&quot; easily can be tuned by pure intervals (and easily<br/>audible like the septima is, once one has learned to listen to it, which<br/>also isn&apos;t difficult), then the chain of pure major thirds on both side<br/>of the wolf will already make half of the intervals being set, i.e.<br/>C-E-G#/Eb-G-B<br/>As you see, this chain includes not only the wolf and four pure major<br/>thirds, but also 3 meantone tempered minor thirds (C-Eb, E-G, and G#-B),<br/>and - most notably 2 meantone tempered fifths (C-G, E-B).  The effect of<br/>tempered intervals has thus been reached only by tuning justly, and only<br/>   in 6 tuning steps from th starting note!</p><p>The continuation to the remaining notes (to be tuned) is easy. One needs<br/>to find a suitable other wolf!  As two septimas constitute the wolf, you<br/>can just proceed to from the last note of the already established chain<br/>(C-E-G#/Eb-G-B) and build your &quot;wolf&quot; on it: B/Gb. If. like in this<br/>case, the note you reach doesn&apos;t belong to the final temperament - with<br/>12 notes per octave an F# would be by far the choice - then you proceed<br/>to the next thirds until you have reached the alternative (Gb)-Bb-D-F# etc.</p><p>The advantages of such a method would be many:<br/>- no tempering of any interval in the tuning process<br/>- works from every starting note<br/>- works on any pitch<br/>- excellent control of purity of the intervals, because the<br/>    tuning is done (except of the octaves, of course) only with<br/>    major thirds (tenths) and septimas, which are more sensitive to<br/>    out-of tuneness<br/>- easy to remember basic principle (you&apos;ll never again need to<br/>    write it down)<br/>- since no tempered intervals need to be checked, you can (and<br/>    actually should) set immediately all octaves of any note<br/>    which you have just tuned<br/>- needs tuning of maximum 5 notes more, than the whole keybaoard<br/>    has<br/>- you can&apos;t set ordinary meantone temperament as precise by any<br/>    other means</p><p>Disadavantages<br/>- requires that one is capable and able to listen to septimas (that)<br/>    should&apos;nt be a major obstacle)<br/>- works only on overtone/partial-rich instruments like<br/>    many harpsichords, regals, organ reed stops etc.</p><p>Below I&apos;ll provide the most easy way of setting this meantone<br/>temperament, which actually is a just major-third/septima-tuning:  All<br/>intervals can be expressed in rather simple ratios of a limited number<br/>of major thirds and septimas (even if the ratios themselves will easily<br/>look awkward if calculated and written out).</p><p>    ------------</p><p>First the basic idea of the tuning process:</p><p>1) For an ordinary keyboard (12 notes per octave):</p><p>  From C:</p><p>C<br/>E<br/>G#<br/>(septimal F#)<br/>(septimal E, which is meantone) Eb<br/>G<br/>B<br/>(septimal A)<br/>(septimal G, which is meantone Gb)<br/>Bb<br/>D<br/>F#<br/>(septimal E)<br/>(septimal D, which is meantone Db)<br/>F<br/>A<br/>C#</p><p>    -------</p><p>2) If the instrument has split keys Ab and D# it is even more effective,<br/>one can start with</p><p>C<br/>Ab<br/>(C-)E<br/>G#<br/>(septimal F#)<br/>(septimal E, which is meantone) Eb<br/>G<br/>B<br/>D#<br/>(septimal C#)<br/>(septimal B, which is meantone) Bb<br/>D<br/>F#<br/>(septimal E)<br/>(septimal D, which is meantone Db)<br/>F<br/>A<br/>C#<br/>   -----------</p><p>To make the tuning process practical it must be userfriendly, easy and<br/>comfortable.<br/>Especially remembering, which notes in which octaves one has already<br/>tuned, can be quite awkward.</p><p>But the process can be simplified greatly by</p><p>immediately tuning all octaves of a note, as soon as it has been set by<br/>in the tuning process.<br/>Then one doesn&apos;t need to remember which notes in which octaves one has<br/>already tuned.</p><p>This is also useful because, one can after each tuned note (and its<br/>octaves) freely choose the range in which an interval is most easily<br/>heard (for example often in the tenor range - but that might differ a bit)</p><p>    --------<br/>Alternative 1</p><p> From any  C<br/>(Always tune all octaves immediately!)</p><p>1) Set C<br/>2) C-E&ndash;G#<br/>3) G#&ndash;(7F#)&ndash;(7E =) Eb<br/>4) Eb&ndash;G&ndash;B<br/>5) B&ndash;(7A)&ndash;(7G = Gb)&ndash;Bb<br/>6) Bb&ndash;D&ndash;F#<br/>7) F#&ndash;(7E)&ndash;(7D = Db)&ndash;F<br/>     (after tuning the octaves of f, retune the one<br/>     7E back to be pure C-E<br/>8) F&ndash;A&ndash;C#</p><p>Amount of tuning steps: total number of keys  + 5.</p><p>    --------<br/>Alternative 2</p><p> From any  A<br/>(Always tune all octaves immediately!)</p><p>Set A<br/>A-F, A&ndash;C#<br/>C#&ndash;(7B)-(7A = Ab)&ndash;C<br/>C&ndash;E&ndash;G#<br/>G#&ndash;(7F#)&ndash;(7E =) Eb<br/>Eb&ndash;G&ndash;B<br/>B&ndash;(7A)&ndash;(7G = Gb)&ndash;Bb<br/>after tuning the octaves, retune the one 7A back to A<br/>Bb&ndash;D&ndash;F#</p><p>Amount of tuning steps: total number of keys  + 5.</p><p>    --------<br/>Alternative 3</p><p> From any  F<br/>(Always tune all octaves immediately!)</p><p>Set F<br/>F-A, A&ndash;C#<br/>...<br/>continue like above</p><p>Amount of tuning steps: total number of keys  + 5.</p><p>    --------</p><p>kind regards</p><p>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>PS:<br/>      For the maths-interested</p><p>Some Ratios and Cents of Purely Tuned Meantone<br/>related to the fundamental C</p><p>(Cent-figures rounded to maximum 2 decimals)</p><p>C  =   0 Cent     = 1/1<br/>E  = 386.31 Cent  = 5/4<br/>Double-septimal Abb (German: asas)/&quot;Wolf&quot;<br/>   = 737.65 Cent  = 49/32 = (7/4)2<br/>G# = 772.63 Cent  = 50/32 = (5/4)^2<br/>Eb = 310.28 Cent  = 1225/1024 = (5/4)^2 * (7/4)^2 / (2/1)^2<br/>Meantone G<br/>   = 696.59 Cent  = 6125/4096 = (5/4)^3 * (7/4)^2 / (2/1)^2<br/>Meantone minor semitone C#<br/>   =  76.03 Cent  = 256/245 = (2/1)^2 / (5/4) / (7/4)^2</p><p>Compare the above figures with<br/>(Theoretically Exact) Regular Meantone</p><p>C           =      0 Cent<br/>E           = 386.31 Cent<br/>Wolf/G#&ndash;Eb  = 737.64 Cent<br/>G#          = 772.63 Cent<br/>Eb          = 310.26 Cent<br/>G           = 696.58 Cent<br/>C#          =  76.05 Cent</p></div>
