What I am attempting to do is take a set of<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios for 1 octave (1/1-2/1) and translate them over a wider range of 8<br/>&gt; &gt; octaves. The original octave contains highly specified ratios which are<br/>&gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; decimals. It seems to be moderately difficult. One idea is to map it as<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; triangle where the top smaller area has the line for the 1 octave range<br/>&gt; &gt; while the base of the triangle is the 8 octave range. I am using scala<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; will want the results to be in hz ( or possibly cents would work) for a<br/>&gt; non<br/>&gt; &gt; linear scale. If anyone would like to try to solve this problem please<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t hesitate to help out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t see the problem. What do you mean by non linear?<br/>&gt; Why do you need these triangles? To move ratios up or down<br/>&gt; an octave you multiply or divide by 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Graham also thank you for your interest in the solution to this.  As I<br/>&gt; have explained above, by non linear mapping I mean no octave repeats.<br/>What<br/>&gt; it really means I believe is complete freedom in tuning, no certain<br/>&gt; temperament all the way through the sonic range.  If you wanted an<br/>arbitrary<br/>&gt; random pattern as your tuning you can do so with a pattern  actually I<br/>&gt; really meant to say is &quot;LINEAR&quot; so thats my bad.  Anyhow...LINEAR MAPPING<br/>is<br/>&gt; the correct term.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are still with me after that, ok, let me explain.  I want to take a<br/>&gt; one octave set of ratios, apply them over an 8 octave range with no<br/>regards<br/>&gt; to repetitive octaves in the tuning.  This will appear as a 27 note piano<br/>&gt; with unique frequencies and specific ones.</p><p>Ah, I think I&apos;m beginning to understand what you want to get. I&apos;m only not<br/>sure if you wanted to preserve frequency ratios or length ratios and<br/>therefore if you meant linear frequency shifting or linear length shifting.<br/>So I&apos;ll assume you meant frequency shifting now. Well, a standard piano has<br/>a range of approx. 7 octaves, not 8, so let me stay with this. Okay, if<br/>you&apos;re using Scala, then load your set of intervals, type<br/>&quot;Move/frequency -126/127&quot;, and see the result. If you want to preserve<br/>length proportions instead, type &quot;Move/length -126/254&quot;. As to my view, I<br/>don&apos;t think these very unequal sets of tones are an easy choice to tune on a<br/>piano indeed.

If<br/>you said you wanted to stretch the interval sizes in such a way you got<br/>seven octaves instead of one, I think you had been understood sooner. Sorry<br/>I&apos;m saying 7 octaves instead of 8.

I must be<br/>&gt; missing something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan, thanks for your interest.  The more that I have looked<br/>&gt; into solving this problem the grander it seems to reveal itself<br/>&gt; as being moderately difficult.  The reason I don&apos;t think you<br/>&gt; can multiply by powers of 2 or any simple multiplication is<br/>&gt; that I need to resolve the ratios in a larger system and then<br/>&gt; attain exact frequencies.  Let me restate the problem:  I<br/>&gt; have a 1 octave series of ratios in decimals for instance<br/>&gt; the 15th note is 1/.64641 and the octave would be 1/.5 or 2/1.<br/>&gt; This is a one octave set of 27 ratios all in decimal format<br/>&gt; which you can resolve to simply a number and not a fraction.<br/>&gt; I am looking to use the same proportional ratios over a<br/>&gt; wider range, in my case, the piano&apos;s range approx.  Which<br/>&gt; we&apos;ll say 8 octaves to make it simple. So I&apos;m looking to use<br/>&gt; the same proportions only this time over a wider area without<br/>&gt; any repeats.</p><p>I think you might be having some trouble expressing exactly<br/>what you want, because maybe you&apos;re not familiar enough with<br/>the mathematics. Here&apos;s my go at it:</p><p>It seems to me that what you want is to take the same<br/>proportional relationships between the notes as they are<br/>currently expressed within one octave (2/1 ratio), and<br/>stretch all of them so that the range which formerly<br/>covered one octave covers 8 octaves in the new tuning.<br/>Yes?</p><p>To do that, you have to use logarithms. For tuning math<br/>calculations, it almost always makes sense to use logs<br/>with base 2, since we generally treat the 2/1 as an<br/>equivalence interval. In your case, you&apos;re not doing<br/>that, so you could use any base you like, but i&apos;ll stick<br/>with base 2. Using the two example pitches you provided:</p><p>1/.5 = 2.000000<br/>log_2(2.0) = 1.0</p><p>Now just multiply that by 8 and you get your new exponent<br/>of 2: 8.0. And 2^8 = 256, so that&apos;s your new ratio.</p><p>1/.64641 = 1.547006<br/>log_2(1.547006) = ~0.629479</p><p>Multiply that by 8 and you get ~5.035829.<br/>And 2^5.035829 = ~32.804663, your new ratio for that note.</p><p>Understand how to do that?</p><p>If the method i&apos;ve explained is what you were looking for,<br/>and you still don&apos;t understand how to do the math, i&apos;ll<br/>be happy to do it for you if you provide the whole list<br/>of original ratios. It also simple to convert to Hz as well.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=71070 href="#71070">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2007 10:28:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz wrote:</p><p>It seems to me that what you want is to take the same<br/>proportional relationships between the notes as they are<br/>currently expressed within one octave (2/1 ratio), and<br/>stretch all of them so that the range which formerly<br/>covered one octave covers 8 octaves in the new tuning.<br/>Yes?</p><p>I have understood it exactly the same, Monz.
