The fifth is not exact.  The<br/>thirds aren&apos;t exact.  But the octave is.  If the ET scale repeats itself<br/>every multiple of 2, then the octaves are just.  That doesn&apos;t apply to<br/>non-traditional ET scales based on, say, the natural twelfth (3/1) or other<br/>intervals.</p><p>And I thought that was kinda unfair.  So to be egalitarian in regards to all<br/>the intervals, I decided to compromise all intervals including octaves.  Now<br/>there is &quot;pain&quot; even in octaves.  And I chose the natural logarithm base<br/>because it&apos;s called &quot;natural&quot;, and is a feature in natural processes.  I<br/>could&apos;ve used pi, I guess, but I think that&apos;s been done already anyway.<br/>(Circle of fifths?)</p><p>Also, maybe I&apos;m warped, but I like a little &quot;pain&quot; in intonation.  Just<br/>intonation sounds sterile and flat to me.  When notes are slightly detuned,<br/>I hear more richness in tone, like a slight chorus effect that a rock<br/>guitarist might use.  I took a piano solo MIDI and applied the 52-NET scale,<br/>skipping every third note in the scale, which approximates 12-tone ET very<br/>reliably.  With the octaves a little &quot;off&quot;, the piano sound took on a new<br/>characteristic.  Then I applied what I call the &quot;ugly tuning&quot;: 17-tone NET,<br/>which results in a 12-tone ET where each chromatic step is 11 cents sharp --<br/>cumulatively.  Go up a few octaves and you&apos;re WAY out of tune.  It sounded<br/>like an old piano that hasn&apos;t been tuned in ages.</p><p>49-tone NET is a good substitute for 17-tone ET (skip every second note),<br/>and 153-tone NET emulates 53-tone ET (again, skip every second note).  If<br/>you use only every fourth note in 127-tone NET, you get 22-tone ET, and if<br/>you use every fifth note in 137-tone NET, you get 19-tone ET.</p><p>Finally, my rationale for using 2.7183 as a basis for equal temperament is<br/>something of a cultural statement.  Back when Western &quot;civilization&quot;<br/>abandoned just intonation for equal temperament, music underwent a radical<br/>change which many of the old school railed against.  All the old perfect<br/>intervals were gone (but hey, at least we had slain that &quot;wolf fifth&quot;!).  So<br/>my satirical response was to destroy the last perfect interval in modern<br/>music -- the octave.  I have consummated the revolution.</p><p>And I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going to have to unsub from the group in order to save<br/>time; I&apos;m getting way too much e-mail as it is and can&apos;t even read a<br/>fraction of what I get.  I got so much going on in the &quot;real world&quot;, but<br/>I&apos;ll keep working on new ideas.  When I come up with something grand -- or<br/>at least something grandiostically eccentric -- I&apos;ll let y&apos;all know.</p><p>So catch my six everybody....</p><p>Danny</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=30725 href="#30725">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>11/26/2001 7:16:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawier@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_30711.html#30711">/tuning/topicId_30711.html#30711</a></p><p>&gt; And I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going to have to unsub from the group in order<br/>to save time; I&apos;m getting way too much e-mail as it is and can&apos;t even<br/>read a fraction of what I get.
