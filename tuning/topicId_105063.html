The term &quot;meantone&quot; is meaningless to most n00bs anyway.  If you&apos;re gonna simplify for the sake of the n00bs, I say drop the temperament names all together.  It&apos;s not meantone-7, it&apos;s just the diatonic scale!  I do not discuss temperaments or commas at all in the introductory ET books I&apos;m writing until the appendices, so when I introduce scales, I just name them something that seems intuitive.  Like instead of calling it &quot;Porcupine[7]&quot; in 15-ED2, I call it the &quot;quasi-equal heptatonic&quot;...because really, that&apos;s just waaaaay more intuitive and transparent than &quot;porcupine&quot;.  If there&apos;s only one scale of a certain size that&apos;s of interest in an ET, I don&apos;t even give it a qualifier, I just call it the &quot;(penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, ennea-, deca-, etc.)tonic scale&quot;.</p><p>This only works for small ETs, of course, but if someone&apos;s into a larger ET there&apos;s no point in simplifying for their benefit, because they&apos;re already sold on something complicated.</p><p>I do mention the novel enharmonic equivalences of each ET, like how in 15 five perfect fifths gets you back to where you started, or in 14 it&apos;s seven of them that does that, or that in 17 you can divide the perfect fifth in half or in five equal parts, etc.  This can be construed as a non-mathematical or &quot;conceptual&quot; version of temperament, I suppose, wherein Porcupine, instead of being the 250/243 temperament, is the temperament where two small whole-tones makes a minor 3rd and three makes a perfect 4th.  Paul would have a fit about my rampant diatonic centrism, of course, but on the other hand, every ET of interest has at least one regular heptatonic scale with very worthwhile properties.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe the temperament[N] notation is due to Gene, so I&apos;m going to<br/>&gt; ask: is there a difference between meantone[7] and meantone-7?

What about Nusecond?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is 4L3s in 15-ED2 Keemun[7] or Orgone[7] or something else?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, this is a less clear example. A little while ago, I was working<br/>&gt; on a nice simple system for these cases, where you just pick the &quot;most<br/>&gt; general&quot; temperament in each case which covers everything else. This<br/>&gt; involves being able to cut across subgroups. But, for now, I&apos;m happy<br/>&gt; for people to just call it whatever they want. What are they calling<br/>&gt; it in 15-EDO now, Orgone? Then orgone it is.</p><p>No one&apos;s calling it anything, except I guess me, because no one&apos;s using it.  There&apos;s precious little consensus on a lot of important scales, and in some cases, the consensus is only a couple people.  What about 5L1s in 16, is it Machine or Slendric?  3L4s in 17, is it Beatles or Maqamic or Mohajira?  Is 5L2s in 12-TET Meantone or (gasp) Superpyth?  After all, 64/63 vanishes in 12-TET, and if you leave out the mapping for 5 and play a bunch of 0-700-1000 chords, you could make a compelling argument for Superpyth.</p><p>In case you can&apos;t tell, the reason I don&apos;t like your nice, simple system is that temperament names reflect more how a scale will be used than any nice clear objective properties of the scales.  Play a bunch of 4:5:9 chords in 6-ED2 and you&apos;d be hard-pressed to say anything but 81/80 is important, but is 6-ED2 meantone in your system?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see why someone should have to learn any of that stuff at all.<br/>&gt; One extreme is learning all the math, another extreme is throwing it<br/>&gt; all away and starting over without JI, but there&apos;s plenty of room in<br/>&gt; the middle. For instance, one thing that&apos;s in the middle is how Ron<br/>&gt; has all of these scale books that just say what the different MOS&apos;s in<br/>&gt; each EDO are, and (usually) the lowest-badness temperament that refers<br/>&gt; to them. Books like that which also had some info about how to<br/>&gt; practically use each one, as you do in your paper, that&apos;d also be<br/>&gt; another thing in the middle ground.</p><p>Sure, Ron&apos;s a good sport about just playing along with whatever the naming consensus is, but I&apos;m not.  I&apos;ll include that stuff in an appendix or a sidebar describing &quot;some theorists who discovered this scale independently&quot;, but what I care about is the simplest, clearest, least-threatening presentation possible.  There should be a reason for everything, and it should be obvious.  I can&apos;t change history, but I reckon I can change the state of discourse if I ever succeed in finishing these blasted books and get them out to people.</p><p>&gt; OK, what about maqamic[7] in 17-EDO? What about mavila[7] in 16-EDO or<br/>&gt; 23-EDO? Are these also quasi-equal hepatonics?</p><p>Mavila[7] in 16 is just the 16-tone diatonic scale; maqamic[7] is certainly a quasi-equal heptatonic (IIRC, that&apos;s exactly how it&apos;s described in scala), but I could call the neutral heptatonic or the neutral diatonic as well.  Of course no text on 17 would be complete without a comprehensive list of maqamat, since 17&apos;s the smallest ET that supports all of them in general outline.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why would you point them to that temperament, when they&apos;ve already found the tuning system they&apos;re looking for?

I don&apos;t think it makes sense to privilege the 5-limit, especially when several ETs of interest--11, 13, 14, 17, and 18--don&apos;t really support the 5-limit in very meaningful ways. And other ETs of interest--15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 24, and pretty much everything above 25--are primarily of interest because of what they do in limits above 5.

I don&apos;t deal with 22, because I don&apos;t see a point in anyone learning anything about 22 unless they want to learn about it as an 11-limit temperament.  In which case, to go back to the OP, I doubt such people are really going to be very concerned whether it&apos;s Porcupine[7] or Porcupine-7.  What I am saying is, the kind of people who are so scared of math that anything with brackets makes their eyes glaze over are not going to want to learn about temperaments, period, and are not going to care about JI, either, and are therefore not going to be interested in the merits of large accurate temperaments like 22, 26, 27, or 31.  They probably just like microtonality because it&apos;s &quot;weird&quot;, and they probably don&apos;t care about the specific ways in which it&apos;s &quot;better&quot; than 12, and will probably be about equally interested in a bunch of low ETs.

And yeah, mavila[9] is totally superdiatonic, that&apos;s the only name that makes sense for it.

All<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve suggested is unsystematically naming things after...<br/>&gt; something else, I&apos;m not quite sure what.</p><p>Alright, tell you what.  I tried to do exactly what you are trying to do at one time, and I failed.  Here&apos;s what happened:<br/>I decided that I would name generator ranges according to generators that would produce the same MOS up to 15 notes.  I came up with this spreadsheet to demonstrate the ranges: <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/IgliashonJones/MOS">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/IgliashonJones/MOS</a> Spreadsheet.pdf</p><p>That gives 29 different MOS families, excluding multi-MOS scales, each of which should have a unique name under my system.  Frankly, I could probably have gone narrower, 1\10 was the smallest generator I covered (because I couldn&apos;t imagine anyone caring about something smaller), but you could take it down to 1\16 probably, since people like Valentine temperament.  But that&apos;s not important.</p><p>Wanna know the problem with this, which ultimately caused me to abandon this project?  Let&apos;s say we call 1\7--2\13 &quot;Tetracot&quot;, and 2\13--1\6 &quot;Roulette&quot;.  Well, what&apos;s the scale in 13-ED2 that&apos;s generated by 2\13?  Is it Tetracot or Roulette?  Well, it&apos;s apparently both.  But that&apos;s stupid, now we have two names for the same scale, which creates more problems and more confusion than it solves.</p><p>And there&apos;s no way out of it.  This happens in every ET up to 15 notes.  If we try to say &quot;okay, we&apos;ll narrow the ranges, such that we&apos;re grouping scales that make the same MOS up to 22 notes&quot;, the problem gets worse instead of better, because now every ET up to 22 has a boundary case.  If we try to widen the ranges and say we&apos;re just going to name the generators that produce the same MOS up to 10 notes, then we start lumping scales together that are actually very different from each other--2\9 to 1\4 becomes one MOS family, despite the massive harmonic differences in scales with (say) a 272-cent generator and a 282-cent generator.  It&apos;s hopeless.  And mappings don&apos;t make it any better, either, because you&apos;ll always run into ETs that can use multiple mappings for the same scale.  Like 12-TET and its superpyth meantone.</p><p>I guess what I&apos;m hoping you&apos;ll take a way from this is that naming things according to how you intuitively group scales across tunings is actually impossible to systematize, and is going to be fraught with problems no matter what you try to do.  The only solution is not to use names to group scales across tunings, and just accept that however similar two tunings of a scale might be in one regard, they&apos;re different in another regard and you shouldn&apos;t gloss over those differences.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2012 11:24:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Oct 23, 2012 at 1:00 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because what limit are we supposed to talk in?

If<br/>we had something like that, then it&apos;d be easy enough for us to see<br/>which temperament is the lowest-superbadness one generated by 2\13. If<br/>you design the measure correctly, it won&apos;t ever yield a ridiculous<br/>result like tetracot, because something like glacial will be so much<br/>lower in superbadness that it&apos;d come up first. So you won&apos;t have to<br/>try and force-fit full-limit temperaments to these various EDOs, you<br/>can just find the best overall subgroup that does the trick and go<br/>with that.</p><p>Doing this allows you to come up with a sort of &quot;family&quot; structure<br/>like what we have now, except instead of 5-limit temperaments<br/>extending to 7-limit ones and so on, you can have things like 2.3.7<br/>superpyth extending to <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> superpyth, and 2.9/7.5/3 sensi<br/>extending to 7-limit sensi, and so on. The 2.3.11 243/242 temperament<br/>can extend to <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> mohajira if you temper out 81/80, and <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a><br/>maqamic if you temper out 64/63, and so on.</p><p>So in effect, I&apos;m talking about a temperament finder like Graham&apos;s<br/>that doesn&apos;t require you to put in any limit, but searches across all<br/>temperaments. So I would expect that if you do this, you&apos;ll end up<br/>with, I dunno, maybe 25 temperament families that most people agree<br/>are kickass. These are all the names that people will ever have to<br/>learn, and they&apos;re guaranteed to be the most musically useful.<br/>Theorists may continue to come up with different names for the<br/>extensions of these, like sorcery and astrology and so on for magic<br/>temperament, and that&apos;s fine. Theorists can continue to do that,<br/>musicians can continue to just refer to the name of the base<br/>temperament in the family, and life goes on. Again, it&apos;s the same as<br/>how people say that 12-EDO supports meantone temperament instead of<br/>dominatrix or whatever, because the latter implies the former.</p><p>This is what I was working on a while ago, but then I got sidetracked<br/>with Weil tuning stuff.
