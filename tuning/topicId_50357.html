But as you recognize that 4 and 8 are related to<br/>the 2nd harmonic (the octave), you could also recognize that going up<br/>a ninth-harmonic ratio up is equivalent to going up two third-<br/>harmonic ratios. So, in a &quot;prime&quot; sense, you just take into account<br/>the prime factors:2,3,5,7,11, etc.</p><p>Decomposed in such way, 49/40 is 7*7/2*2*2*5. In words, &quot;going up two<br/>seventh harmonics, going down a fifth harmonic, then going down three<br/>octaves.</p><p>11/9 is 11/3*3 decomposed.</p><p>We say that 49/40 is 7-prime-limit, because when decomposed it<br/>contains no factor greater than 7.</p><p>11/9 is 11-prime-limit, but not a 7-prime-limit ratio, because it has<br/>11 as a factor, which is greater than 7.</p><p>These are labels that help us to understand some of the<br/>characteristics of ratios.</p><p>You may hear: Though 12-eq properly represents some 5-(prime)-limit<br/>ratios, it can&apos;t approximate many 7-limit fractions. That is because<br/>it does a great job with ratios like 3/2, 4/3, 5/4 (hum?), 9/8, etc.<br/>but cannot represent accurately the seventh harmonic (7/4).</p><p>I hope this stands as a better explanation than the previous post,<br/>but please do not hesitate to ask for info, or inquire about<br/>anything. I&apos;m pretty sure there are people here that can help you<br/>with better, clearer comments, but in any case do not let yourself<br/>down. There&apos;s much info on tuning I can&apos;t understand at the moment<br/>(maybe I&apos;ll never do), but that doesn&apos;t make this group less<br/>interesting.<br/>--- End forwarded message ---<br/>                                               Stephen Szpak writes:</p><p>        You did fine.
