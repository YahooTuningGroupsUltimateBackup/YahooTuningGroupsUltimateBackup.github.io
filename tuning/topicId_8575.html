Then violins hit the scene and took over the<br/>&gt; &gt; responsibility for &quot;ear&quot; tuning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>To add to Joe Monzo&apos;s remarks:</p><p>Perhaps Mr. Eskalin is using the term &quot;renaissance&quot; without enough<br/>specificity. If you could narrow down the term in time and geography, and<br/>possibly name some specific repertoire, we could probably come to some more<br/>certain statements.</p><p>That said, if I may be excused my own generalizations, in the vocal<br/>polyphonic repertoire from the great composers of the Netherlands through<br/>Palestrina, there is a great deal of uncertainty about about whether, which,<br/>and how instruments were used or not used.  In no case does vocal ensemble<br/>performance with recorder or viol accompaniment seem to have the importance<br/>that the modern -- and principly amateur -- early music movement would lead<br/>one to believe. On the other hand, the use of the organ as accompaniment is<br/>not well understood, and the &quot;Posaunenchor&quot; of cornettos and early trombones<br/>seems to be underestimated.  Fretted strings (viols, lutes, citterns etc.)<br/>appear likely to have played a role in secular repertoire, but knowlege of<br/>secular repertoire is even more limited. Although the fretting patterns were<br/>likely an approximation of ET, Lindley&apos;s volume on &quot;Lutes, Viols and<br/>Temperaments&quot; makes a case for a large degree of latitude with the use of<br/>moveable frets.</p><p>All of this suggests a mixed tuning environment: a bit of pythagorean, some<br/>just, meantone, and something like 12tet from the fretted strings. Perhaps<br/>I&apos;m perverse in this regard, but this does not particularly trouble me, as<br/>this was also an era of transition from modality to tonality, and I assume<br/>that many decisions whether compositional or in performance practice were<br/>answered pragmatically rather than theoretically.</p><p>I would suggest -- perhaps Margo Schulter could advise on this --  that this<br/>list consider the &quot;common practice&quot; period as beginning with Monteverdi&apos;s<br/>second practice (beginning in the fifth book of Madrigals in 1605, soon<br/>followed by the _Orfeo_ of 1607) where the use of continuo accompaniment<br/>becomes firmly established.  Not only are the essential features of<br/>functional, tonal harmony established in this era, but they are established<br/>within the meantone environment. The &quot;commonality&quot; of the era would be<br/>marked by the spread of the continuo ideal throughout Europe.</p><p>The question of when to locate the _end_ of the common practice era is a<br/>more difficult one.  Examining this in terms of the factors above suggests a<br/>long transition: The continuo bass began its decline with the advent of<br/>instrumental (not vocal) works without continuo in the late 18th century<br/>and ended decisively when Rossini replaced the _recitativo secco_  with<br/>_recitativo stromentato_ in 1815. Meantone temperament was decisively<br/>replaced by 12tet only in the middle of the 19th century. The harmonic<br/>language itself received a series of challenges: new varieties of tonal<br/>motion (especially in post-revolutionary French music of Lesueur and<br/>Berlioz), the chromaticism and symmetries of Lizst and Wagner, the<br/>exhaustive search for chordal alterations with Bruckner, etc..</p><p>I propose we consider the birthyear of Hugo Riemann (1849-1919) as defining<br/>the end of the common practice:  the pianomaker Broadwood was retiring the<br/>last meantone tuner, Helmholz (whose 1863 work would be essential to<br/>Riemann) had taken his first professorship in physiology, Wagner had<br/>finished Lohengrin, begun the Ring and would compose Tristan in 1855, Brahms<br/>was finishing his private schooling, Berlioz&apos;s _Treatise_ was six years old,<br/>and Rossini was happily cooking and composing his &quot;sins of old age&quot;.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
