I was looking for temperaments that have pelog-like scales in them, and found one in a 9-note chain of a temperament that I wasn&apos;t familiar with ... looked it up in a list of temperaments and it turned out to be &quot;gorgo&quot;. The interesting thing about this one is that it gorgo is a 5&amp;16 temperament, on a line between 5-ET and 16-ET. So you can take it in one direction and approach a slendro tuning, and in the other direction it approaches 16-ET which is a mavila temperament. In the middle it&apos;s kind of a hybrid pelog-slendro. Not very traditional, but it could have uses.</p><p>! gorgo-pelog.scl<br/>!<br/>Pelog-like subset of gorgo[9]<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 64.82352<br/> 293.02282<br/> 521.22213<br/> 684.59791<br/> 749.42143<br/> 977.62074<br/> 1205.82004</p><p>It&apos;s not a very typical pelog; that 64.8 cent step is way small.
