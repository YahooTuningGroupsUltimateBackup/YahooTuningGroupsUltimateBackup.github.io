The<br/>number of pitches in this scale turned out to be the number of fifths in the<br/>chain between the two notes defining the unison vector. Our examples were a<br/>pentatonic scale, defined by a unison vector of 5 fifths, a &quot;Pythagorean<br/>limma&quot; of 90 cents; and a 12-tone scale, defined by a unison vector of 12<br/>fifths, a &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot; of 23 cents.</p><p>Now let&apos;s consider 5-limit just intonation. It can be considered an infinite<br/>succession of 3-limit JI systems, separated by just major thirds (5:4<br/>ratio). Let us put our familiar 3-limit system in the middle, and stack its<br/>transpositions by a 5:4 up, upwards, and by a 5:4 down, downwards:<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...--50/27---25/18---25/24---25/16---75/64--225/128-675/512-..<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...--40/27---10/9-----5/3-----5/4----15/8----45/32--135/128-...<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...--32/27---16/9-----4/3-----1/1-----3/2-----9/8----27/16--...<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...-256/135--64/45---16/15----8/5-----6/5-----9/5----27/20--...<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...1024/675-256/225-128/75---32/25---48/25---36/25---27/25--...<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>We could have used 5:3 instead of 5:4, but this way is a bit easier to<br/>remember: gaining a factor of 3 means moving one place to the right, and<br/>gaining a factor of 5 means moving one place upwards.</p><p>Now say we again start in the middle (1/1) and start adding notes around it.<br/>Unlike the 3-limit case, the direction we move in this lattice amy affect<br/>which small intervals we end up finding. Say we just look at the notes<br/>adjoining 1/1. The interval between 6/5 and 5/4, as well as that between 8/5<br/>and 5/3, is a chromatic semitone or about 71 cents. This interval is always<br/>produced on this lattice by moving one step to the left and two steps up. In<br/>other words, it corresponds to losing (dividing by) a factor of 3 and<br/>gaining (multiplying by) two factors of 5. In vector notation, we may write</p><p>(-1 2) = 71 cents.</p><p>Unlike the 3-limit case, a single unison vector in the 5-limit lattice does<br/>not collapse the infinite pitch variety into a finite set. It may be<br/>considered to collapse it into a single vertical line (since every note is<br/>equivalent to another note in an adjoining vertical line), or a set of two<br/>parallel horizontal lines (since every note is equivalent to a note two<br/>horizontal lines away), or a diagonal band, but in any case the number of<br/>distinct pitches is still infinite. We need to define one more unison vector<br/>to get a finite set of pitches.</p><p>If we add a few more notes related by fifths to those adjoining 1/1, we soon<br/>find pairs of notes with small intervals between them. The interval between<br/>10/9 and 9/8, as well as that between 16/9 and 9/5, is a syntonic comma or<br/>about 22 cents. On the lattice, it corresponds to any move of four steps to<br/>the right and one step down:</p><p>(4 -1) = 22 cents.</p><p>With these two unison vectors, we may now find a finite set of pitches which<br/>is equivalent to the whole infinite lattice. How do we go about this?<br/>Fokker&apos;s solution was to draw a parallelogram having the two unison vectors<br/>as sides. In this case, two opposite sides of the parallelogram would slope<br/>one step to the left and two steps up, while the other two sides would slope<br/>four steps to the right and one step down. This parallelogram would be wide<br/>enough along each of the unison vectors to contain one and only pitch from<br/>each equivalence class. Moreover, the parallelogram shpae would tile the<br/>plane, so that every pitch would fall into one and only one parallelogram.<br/>Let us illustrate this for our example:<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       |       |       |       |               |       | *<br/>     * |    *  |       |       |       |*      |       |<br/>...-50/27*---25/18---25/24---25/16---75/64--225/128-675/512-..<br/>       |     * |       |       |       | *     |       |<br/>       |       | *     |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |      *|     * |       |       |  *    |       |<br/>       |       |       | *     |       |       |       |<br/>       |       *       |     * |       |   *   |       |<br/>       |       |       |       | *     |       |       |<br/>       |       |*      |       |     * |    *  |       |<br/>...--40/27---10/9-----5/3-----5/4----15/8*---45/32--135/128-...<br/>       |       | *     |       |       |     * |       |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       | *     |<br/>       |       |  *    |       |       |      *|     * |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       | *<br/>     * |       |   *   |       |       |       *       |<br/>       | *     |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |     * |    *  |       |       |       |*      |<br/>...--32/27---16/9*----4/3-----1/1-----3/2-----9/8----27/16--...<br/>       |       |     * |       |       |       | *     |<br/>       |       |       | *     |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |      *|     * |       |       |  *    |<br/>       |       |       |       | *     |       |       |<br/>       |       |       *       |     * |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       | *     |       |<br/>       |       |       |*      |       |     * |    *  |<br/>...-256/135--64/45---16/15----8/5-----6/5-----9/5*---27/20--...<br/>       |       |       | *     |       |       |     * |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       | *<br/>     * |       |       |  *    |       |       |      *|<br/>       | *     |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |     * |       |   *   |       |       |       *<br/>       |       | *     |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |     * |    *  |       |       |       |*<br/>..1024/675-256/225-128/75*---32/25---48/25---36/25---27/25--...<br/>       |       |       |     * |       |       |       | *<br/>       |       |       |       | *     |       |       |<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>Using our two unison vectors, we have divided the plane into identical<br/>parallelograms, each of which has seven lattice points (notes) inside of it.<br/>The parallelogram that is completely visible in the diagram above surrounds<br/>the ratios that most JI enthusiasts associate with the major scale. Every<br/>other parallegram has exactly the same configuration of notes, and each of<br/>its notes is equivalent, through trasposition by one or more unison vectors,<br/>to one and only one note of the central major scale. Thus we may want to say<br/>that the major scale is a periodicity block in the 5-limit lattice.</p><p>Unlike the 3-limit case, though, moving the boundaries of the periodicity<br/>block does not necessarily lead to the same scale.

In general, then, we can only say that the two<br/>unison vectors we have chosen define a periodicity block that is some sort<br/>of diatonic scale, but we can&apos;t be totally precise as to its JI<br/>construction, as any of the notes may be transposed by a unison vector and<br/>the important properties of the periodicity block will be maintained.</p><p>Mathematically, the unison vectors define 7 equivalence classes in the JI<br/>lattice. No matter where we put the paralellograms, each one will have<br/>exactly 7 lattice points inside it, equivalent (through unison vectors) to<br/>the 7 lattice points inside every other parallelogram. This is true because<br/>the area of each parallelogram is exactly 7 (if you consider each step in<br/>both directions of the lattice to be of length 1) and it can be proved that<br/>a parallelogram of area N whose edges are defined with integer vectors<br/>always contains exactly N lattice points no matter where you put it. (If you<br/>put an edge right on a lattice point, you can consider it to be 1/2 inside<br/>and 1/2 outside the parallelogram, and if you put a corner right on a<br/>lattice point, you can consider it to be 1/4 inside, or a fraction<br/>determined by the angle of that corner divided by 360 degrees -- either way,<br/>you will always end up counting exactly N lattice points inside the<br/>parallelogram.)</p><p>Is there a way to calculate the area of the parallelogram from the vector<br/>representation of the unison vectors? Yes, there is! First, put the unison<br/>vectors together into a matrix (the order doesn&apos;t matter):</p><p>( 4 -1)<br/>(     )<br/>(-1  2)</p><p>(those are supposed to be big parentheses around the matrix)</p><p>Now, calculate the determinant of the matrix:</p><p>| 4 -1|<br/>|     | = 7.<br/>|-1  2|</p><p>In case you didn&apos;t know, the formula for the determinant of a<br/>2-by-two-matrix is:</p><p>|a  b|<br/>|    | = a*d - b*c<br/>|c  d|</p><p>If you like geometry, you can convince yourself that this is indeed the<br/>formula for the area of a parallelogram whose sides are defined by vectors<br/>(a b) and (c d). Don&apos;t worry if the determinant comes out negative; you can<br/>throw out the minus sign for these purposes.</p><p>Let&apos;s try another one, since most of us would consider a chromatic semitone<br/>a large enough interval to distinguish on our JI instruments. Proceeding to<br/>add notes related by a major third to those adjacent to 1/1, we find that<br/>25/16 is close to 8/5, and 5/4 is close to 32/25, the difference in each<br/>case being a lesser diesis, or about 41 cents. As a unison vector, this is<br/>written:</p><p>(0  3) = 41 cents.</p><p>If we take this and the syntonic comma as our two unison vectors, we may<br/>draw periodicity blocks like so:<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       |   *   |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |<br/>       |       *       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...--50/27---25/18-*-25/24---25/16---75/64--225/128*675/512-..<br/>       |       |       *       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |   *   |       |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       *       |       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |       |   *   |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       *       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |       |       |   *   |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       *       |<br/>...--40/27---10/9--*--5/3-----5/4----15/8----45/32-*135/128-...<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       *<br/>       |       |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |   *<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...--32/27---16/9--*--4/3-----1/1-----3/2-----9/8--*-27/16--...<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>   *   |       |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |<br/>       *       |       |       |       |       |       |<br/>       |   *   |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |<br/>       |       *       |       |       |       |       |<br/>...-256/135--64/45-*-16/15----8/5-----6/5-----9/5--*-27/20--...<br/>       |       |       *       |       |       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |   *   |       |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       *       |       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |       |   *   |       |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       *       |       |<br/>       |       |   *   |       |       |   *   |   *   |<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       *       |<br/>...1024/675-256/225*128/75---32/25---48/25---36/25-*-27/25--...<br/>       |       |       |       |       |       |       *<br/>       |       |   *   |       |       |       |   *   |   *<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>       .       .       .       .       .       .       .<br/>This periodicity block has 12 notes in it, and corresponds to one of the<br/>proposals for a 12-tone JI system (was it Ramos?)
