A call for transparency that is met with hostility may throw<br/>newcomers off, as they might assume that points you make are true just<br/>because you can be caustic in your response to skepticism.</p><p>You sometimes hastily generalize various facets of psychoacoustics to<br/>music in a way that falsely limits the role of learning in musical<br/>cognition. This is one of those instances, so I&apos;m calling you out on<br/>it. You may want to reconsider if your response on record is to refuse<br/>to back up your point and claim that I&apos;m ignorant about the basics of<br/>psychoacoustics or of regular mapping.</p><p>It&apos;s now the year 2011, Carl.

Using harmonics<br/>&gt; 32-64 with a brick wall 8-cent error cutoff won&apos;t do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I disagree. The &quot;reality&quot; is that harmonics 32-64 each<br/>&gt;&gt; have a sound (or at least a texture) that people can<br/>&gt;&gt; and have learned to recognize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who?

What does it mean, exactly?</p><p>You have it backwards, Carl&apos;s making the claim and I&apos;m the one who&apos;d<br/>like to write a precisely worded reply to it. But just to stop us from<br/>going in circles, sure - I&apos;ll pre-emptively respond to all of the<br/>things that I thought that Carl was going to say. This is going to be<br/>longer than if he&apos;d just say why he&apos;s claiming what he&apos;s claiming, but<br/>since you&apos;re asking, I&apos;ll do it anyway.</p><p>Igs said that he wanted to learn to see everything in terms of fitting<br/>into the harmonic series from harmonics 32-64. He said that this is a<br/>paradigm that people have found useful, and that to those people each<br/>harmonic has &quot;its own sound.&quot; Since we all know that categorical<br/>perception exists, and 6:7:9 in superpyth aeolian and 10:12:15 in<br/>meantone aeolian seem to share &quot;a sound,&quot; we know that part of the<br/>perception of a &quot;sound&quot; stems from categorical perception. My specific<br/>claim is the same as Igs&apos; specific claim, that someone can learn to<br/>take harmonics and reframe them as being a part of harmonics 32-64,<br/>which quite aside from any issue having to do with harmonic entropy,<br/>actually means developing a categorical perception for harmonics 32-64<br/>as a scale, learning to fit dyads into your new &quot;harmonic series<br/>perception&quot; as you can learn to fit something into a &quot;diatonic scale&quot;<br/>perception, and simply developing a unique gestalt for each harmonic<br/>as we seem to have a unique gestalt for a &quot;minor third&quot; that is shared<br/>on some level by both 7/6 and 6/5 (in the right circumstances).</p><p>This is, I believe, the correct interpretation of Igs claim, if you<br/>really think it through, despite that it may appear &quot;numerological&quot; on<br/>the surface.</p><p>Carl first claimed that to learn to hear each harmonic as having &quot;its<br/>own sound&quot; was impossible, an extraordinary claim requiring<br/>extraordinary evidence, etc. Further than just stating skepticism on<br/>the matter, he dismissed its possibility a priori, but I would have<br/>even questioned his skepticism. He initially because he seemed to<br/>think that Igs was talking about differentiating between all dyads up<br/>to the 64-odd-limit or something similar. After we cleared up that Igs<br/>was only talking about taking existing dyads and reframing them as<br/>&quot;rooted&quot; harmonics, he still claimed it was impossible. I wasn&apos;t sure<br/>where Carl was coming from, but thought he might be thinking about<br/>dyadic harmonic entropy, the reasoning for which will fail on multiple<br/>levels, or perhaps about Rothenberg propriety, the reasoning for which<br/>will still fail. I asked him for his reasoning and I still want to<br/>know what it is.</p><p>So yes, I would love to agree with such a policy with Carl!

But to address your question directly -</p><p>Intervallic identification should get harder as the intervals get closer<br/>together, right? So the two closest intervals in this set are the octave,<br/>and 27 cents flat of an octave. I think every person on this list can<br/>recognize when an octave is 27 cents flat, and I think with training most<br/>will be able to distinguish between one that&apos;s 27 cents flat and one that&apos;s<br/>54 cents flat. You yourself heard the 13-limit harmony from 17-equal as<br/>being noticeably off from just, so I assume you&apos;d be able to work out /64 as<br/>well. So my final answer is yes, I think it&apos;s possible. In fact, I&apos;m 99%<br/>sure I can get every dyad in 36-equal, so my answer is emphatically yes. I bet<br/>I could do /64 personally with some training. All of this assumes you aren&apos;t<br/>using a sine wave for a timbre or some such thing.</p><p>My real point, though, is that my friend Sean confuses a perfect fifth and<br/>an octave fairly often. He hears the fifth as consonant and goes &quot;octave.&quot;<br/>However, if you sing him a melody, he can generally sing it back. Musical<br/>context can activate ones categorical perception in a way that playing a<br/>bare dyad can&apos;t. And in this scale, there are low complexity ratios<br/>interspersed everywhere that you can use to find your way around, with<br/>higher complexity ones predictably interspersed between them. Given a<br/>fragment of context, I think almost anyone on the planet could get/64.

This is one of those cases where Harmonic Entropy really does mostly seem to coincide with what I actually hear (IE one regarding a steep curve around a very non-complex ratio AKA the octave).</p><p>  Put a 27 cents difference at around 1088 cents, for example, and you&apos;ll likely have even few people on this list able to tell the difference.<br/>&gt;-----------------------------------------------<br/>  So my hunch is...yes, ability to distinguish resolution of a 64th harmonic or so IS possible...but only with certain intervals.</p></div><h3><a id=100222 href="#100222">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2011 4:41:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Again, you can be as hostile as you want!

This is a consistent theme in our conversations.</p><p>Your assertion that your rudeness stems from my posts being too long<br/>or too &quot;rambling&quot; is unacceptable, and your assertion that I you<br/>desperately try to avoid arguments but that you are provoked into an<br/>aggressive discussion is not supported by anything you have posted. I<br/>have cited several other examples of this behavior in the current<br/>thread, and you have declined to comment on them beyond the above<br/>assertions. This suggests that you perhaps don&apos;t see the issue as a<br/>problem worth addressing. If this is just how you are, and you enjoy<br/>being rude from time to time, then my approach will simply be to<br/>continue the logical discussion and point out whether your unwarranted<br/>animosity was accompanied by an actual logical statement or not, so<br/>that those reading can make their own decisions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Carl, it took me something like 6-7 times of reposting the<br/>&gt; &gt; listening examples in the same thread before you actually<br/>&gt; &gt; listened to them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Completely untrue.</p><p>Anyone can read the thread and see exactly what happened. You called<br/>the examples a &quot;cryptic quiz&quot; and refused to describe how they sounded<br/>to you. And if anyone who checks is clever enough to check between<br/>threads, they can also see how suddenly, without warning, you<br/>responded in the actual example thread, saying &quot;that&apos;s more like it.&quot;<br/>I will not post any more links to posts given your penchant for not<br/>addressing my concerns when you can&apos;t deny the behavior being<br/>attributed to you.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I watched in that thread as you told me that &quot;nothing has an<br/>&gt; &gt; infinite frequency response in real life,&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is true.</p><p>And what was your reasoning for this again? Quantum mechanics samples<br/>space, thus adding quantization error to the transduction of any<br/>signal?</p><p>&gt; &gt; used ERB approximations to prove the inaccuracy of the<br/>&gt; &gt; gammatone filterbank,<br/>&gt; &gt; and claimed that sampling<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t cause periodicity of the auditory spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no idea what either of these statements refer to.</p><p>What do you mean you don&apos;t understand what they refer to? Do you mean<br/>that you don&apos;t understand what they mean? What do you mean by &quot;refer<br/>to?&quot;</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
