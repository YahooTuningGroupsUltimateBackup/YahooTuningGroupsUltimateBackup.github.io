There have<br/>been some attempts to generalize the properties of the diatonic scale so<br/>as to include the pentatonic and point the way towards new microtonal<br/>scales. My paper in Xenharmonikon 17 (a version is at<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>) contains my own<br/>attempt (leading to 10-note scales in 22-tone equal temperament) and a<br/>critique of other attempts at generalizing diatonicity. My approach<br/>looks at both melodic and harmonic criteria as well as tonality -- the<br/>latter exemplified by the predominance of the major and minor modes over<br/>the other five modes in music since the Baroque.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
