This was a real pity.</p><p>The audience was full, as have the previous concerts this season.  I was a<br/>bit rattled by the massive police presence.  No cars were allowed down the<br/>street of the church.  The Badings was beautiful in 31-tET.  And the Partch<br/>was sublime.  Robert Jurgrau appeared for his 2 decade old duo, and Anastasia<br/>presented Ligeti&apos;s microtonal first movement of his viola Sonata.</p><p>But it was John Eaton&apos;s evening: A contingent of 6 singers, flute, clarinet,<br/>electronics, percussionists and piano (wholly inside the piano) participated,<br/>along with myself and Anastasia Solberg on viola.  The superstar singer<br/>Bridget Parker was &quot;unbelievable.&quot;  The audience kept applauding John Eaton,<br/>who eventually got on his knees to bow to the players and to conductor Carmen<br/>Helena Tellez (director of Aguava New Music Studio).  Luckily, we play the<br/>Eaton works again on Monday in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania for another<br/>performance...and recording.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
