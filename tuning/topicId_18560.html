I&apos;m not sure where the glitch<br/>could be, or on whose end.</p><p>Anyway, moving back to &quot;concordant/dual-purpose/discordant&quot;<br/>sonorities, I&apos;d like to share your view that set rules or &quot;universals&quot;<br/>tend to become questionable in various areas where things get<br/>interesting. Like &quot;universals&quot; in the area of natural human languages,<br/>such theories often get influenced by the specific cultural or<br/>stylistic views of the theorists -- not so surprisingly.</p><p>For example, I would say that 9:8 is more _stylistically concordant_<br/>than 7:5 or 10:7 in a setting like that of Western European organum of<br/>the 9th-11th century era based largely on parallel fifths or fourths.<br/>In this kind of setting, a 7:5 may have an effect somewhat analogous<br/>to that of a &quot;Wolf&quot; as a &quot;near-3:2&quot; -- close, but not quite what was<br/>expected.</p><p>The effect here might be a bit like that in rhymed poetry, where a<br/>&quot;near-rhyme&quot; may sound quite &quot;dissonant,&quot; a kind of &quot;mistake,&quot; while<br/>an occasional pair of lines in blank verse might seem less so.</p><p>Similarly, the Pythagorean major third at 81:64 is a commonplace in<br/>13th-14th century style, where it serves as a &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonority,<br/>to borrow Ludmila Ulehla&apos;s 20th-century term: she uses this term for a<br/>sonority neither fully concordant nor urgently discordant. However, if<br/>we place such a third in a Renaissance texture where 5:4 or something<br/>close is the norm, 81:64 may be perceived as an outright &quot;dissonance,&quot;<br/>something jarringly &quot;standing out&quot; from the intonational norm.</p><p>Dan, your scale-building algorithms are to me a reminder that each<br/>scale and style has its own &quot;harmonic inertia,&quot; it own set (or<br/>sometimes various alternative sets) of expectations which define their<br/>own sense of musical congruence.</p><p>If searching for a &quot;universal,&quot; I might propose the statement that<br/>music is generally made under the influence of cultural and stylistic<br/>norms, whether these be critically or uncritically borrowed from some<br/>tradition, or possibly in part devised by the composer or performer.<br/>To seek stylistically-independent definitions of &quot;concord/discord&quot;<br/>would seem to me to be either an activity calling for rather cautious<br/>circumscription, or else likely an exercise in mixing &quot;universals&quot;<br/>with stylistically specific expectations.</p><p>One thing does stand out to me: whoever compares n-tET&apos;s, for example,<br/>whether Ivor Darreg or Brian McLaren or Paul Erlich, is doing so under<br/>the influence of certain stylistic assumptions -- although this can be<br/>most obvious to someone with differing expectations, one might<br/>humorously add.</p><p>Even if one rightly concludes that each equal temperament has its own<br/>&quot;flavor,&quot; the definition of that &quot;flavor&quot; depends on stylistic<br/>expectations -- maybe it would be better to carry Darreg&apos;s assertion a<br/>step further, and say that each equal temperament has a range of<br/>&quot;flavors,&quot; some of which may only be &quot;discovered&quot; (or &quot;tasted&quot;) when<br/>yet unknown styles are invented.</p><p>A largely style-focused approach, far from discouraging the analysis<br/>of concordant/dual-purpose/discordant sonorities (&quot;sonance&quot; as the<br/>Monz would have it), permits us to investigate in depth why a given<br/>scale may or may not fit a given style -- and sometimes why it fits<br/>both happily and surprisingly.</p><p>For example, Paul Erlich&apos;s famous charts of n-tET&apos;s say to me: &quot;Here<br/>is how I would describe these scales in terms of the n-limit music I&apos;m<br/>interested in making myself, where an n-limit paradigm fits my musical<br/>intent more or less closely and consistency is an important<br/>consideration.&quot;</p><p>For other styles, we would want other and often quite different sets<br/>of tables.</p><p>An interesting example is 11-tET, radically unconventional from a<br/>European perspective of composed music because it doesn&apos;t have<br/>anything close to a usual fifth or fourth at 3:2 or 4:3. However, this<br/>scale has several intervals which I would consider as relatively<br/>&quot;concordant,&quot; or as &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities of a sort, for example<br/>the following:</p><p>2/11 octave  ~218.18 cents  (~9:8 or ~8:7; M2 with some &quot;concord&quot;)<br/>3/11 octave  ~327.27 cents  (~6:5, maybe approaching the zone of 17:14)<br/>4/11 octave  ~436.36 cents  (~9:7, about 1 cent wide)<br/>5/11 octave  ~545.45 cents  (~11:8, about 6 cents narrow)<br/>6/11 octave  ~654.55 cents  (~16:11, octave complement of ~11:8)<br/>7/11 octave  ~763.64 cents  (~14:9, octave complement of ~9:7)<br/>8/11 octave  ~872.73 cents  (~8:5, maybe approaching zone of ~28:17)<br/>9/11 octave  ~981.82 cents  (~7:4, about 13 cents wide, or ~16:9)</p><p>This scale may cause acute &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; for some of us<br/>oriented to rules and patterns of European verticality in 9th-20th<br/>century patterns which assume conventional fifths or fourths, but it<br/>invites various new styles, or maybe styles drawing on precedents from<br/>world musics where intervals other than fifths or fourths may take a<br/>higher priority.</p><p>Personally, since I find that &quot;consonance/dissonance&quot; or<br/>&quot;concord/discord&quot; are terms having strong stylistic associations, I<br/>might prefer more neutral concepts such as &quot;simplicity/complexity&quot; for<br/>theories of harmonic entropy and the like.</p><p>Anyway, Dan, your scale-generation methods are at once a wellspring of<br/>diversity and a powerful tool either for devising captivating<br/>variations on the familiar in a given tradition, or for moving to new<br/>territory.
