I used to own and play a<br/>harmonica somewhat, but I had never experimented with the *bending*<br/>capacity of the instrument.</p><p>Along with the instrument came a &quot;nifty&quot; book on how to play blues<br/>harmonica by Bobby Joe Holman.  This is a terrific book since it not<br/>only outlines in &quot;real&quot; music notation the range and capabilities of<br/>the harmonica but all the pitches that can be *bent* and the various<br/>ranges for each.</p><p>Some pitches (they&apos;re not all equal in this capacity) can be bent up<br/>or down as far as 1 1/2 steps.  That takes some practice.  I found<br/>that bending 1/2 step, though, is *very* easy, so anything even less<br/>than that is easier still, though there must be some *control* to do<br/>this.</p><p>It might be nice to &quot;spruce up&quot; a nice chamber piece with a &quot;blues<br/>harp&quot; (otherwise known as an harmonica).  Lets say maybe cello,<br/>violin and harmonica, where all three instruments are playing<br/>microtones.</p><p>A near future project, definitely.</p><p>Joe &quot;Harpman&quot; Pehrson</p></div>
