In a high register, the central pitch<br/>processor has less uncertainty, and the harmonic entropy model predicts, as you<br/>say, that 9:7 is more concordant than 11:8 which is a bit more concordant than<br/>11:9 -- and this agrees with my perceptions too. But in a lower register, a<br/>greater uncertainty is in effect, and Dan Stearns&apos; and my perceptions, as well<br/>as the harmonic entropy model, predict that 11:9 is the most concordant of these<br/>three intervals. Care to comment?&quot;</p><p>My perception in the lower register is that the consonance ranking remains<br/>intact, but that tolerance takes over and intervals within the tolerance range<br/>are heard as out-of-tune versions of simpler ratios. So, with a lower tone below<br/>ca. 175Hz 9:7 has slips into the 5:4 interval class and is heard as an<br/>out-of-tune 5:4, similarly, with the lower tone below 200 Hz or so, the 11:8<br/>gets heard as an out-of-tune 7:5, while 11/9 is optimally positioned so that it<br/>is heard as neither 5:4 or 6:5, at least through the lowest optimal voicing of a<br/>6:5.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=18745 href="#18745">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
