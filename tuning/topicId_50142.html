This was my first<br/>&gt; post anywhere about anything, so you get a gold star.<br/>&gt; The staff for 15 EDO has NOT been established from what<br/>&gt; I can see so far. I&apos;m not sure if I can take Herman Miller&apos;s<br/>&gt; tongue and cheek staff seriously. If Blackwood uses a<br/>&gt; staff I haven&apos;t as yet found a image of it. Regardless,<br/>&gt; two composers using 15 EDO, even if they use the same<br/>&gt; staff does not convince me it is a &quot;standard&quot; that should<br/>&gt; be accepted by future musicians. Thanks.</p><p>Blackwood&apos;s notations for all the EDOs between 13 and 24<br/>use the regular 5-line staff, with unique accidentals for<br/>each tuning.</p><p>i have the score of his _Microtonal Etudes_, but unfortunately<br/>my old scanner doesn&apos;t work with my new computer.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Enjoy the holiday season with great tips from MSN.  <a href="http://special.msn.com/network/happyholidays.armx">http://special.msn.com/network/happyholidays.armx</a></p></div><h3><a id=50145 href="#50145">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2003 5:44:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;      MONZ<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        PERHAPS I CAN FIND A FEW MEASURES OF IT SOMEWHERE ON-LINE.<br/>&gt; THANKS.</p><p>Oh, you mean musical staff!

I already said it makes sense to use a porcupine-LT<br/>notation when that&apos;s what you&apos;re writing for.</p><p>But there are still two ways to do that, as Herman has described on<br/>his website.<br/><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a></p><p>One has the 7 nominals being the 7-tone MOS of the porcupine<br/>temperament. But these are not our usual 7 nominals, and Herman is<br/>careful to say so and to use lowercase letters a to g rather than<br/>uppercase (but I wonder if this is enough distinction). The step from<br/>g to a is around 228 cents while all the others are around 162 cents.</p><p>The other retains the familiar relationship of fifths between the<br/>nominals FCGDAE, but still uses porcupine-7 chromatic accidentals so<br/>the notation stays the same in any porcupine tuning including 15-ET,<br/>22-ET, 37-ET.</p><p>The notation of mine that Herman kindly gives is now outdated only in<br/>that I would not now use the Sims arrows for the 5-comma (81/80), but<br/>rather the sagittal left-barbs. I would only use the arrows for the<br/>11-M-diesis (33/32). As Herman says, both of these commas correspond<br/>to the natural chromatic alteration of the porcupine temperament,<br/>since they both correspond to 7 of its approx 162 cent generators<br/>(octave reduced), given that its 3,5,7,11-generator-mapping is [-3 -5<br/>6 -4].</p><p>It&apos;s certainly debatable whether the 5-comma symbol should be used<br/>because of its lower prime limit or the 11-M-diesis symbol because its<br/>rational size is much closer to its size in porcupine.</p><p>Comparison of the two notations is clearer if we use the same comma<br/>and the same ASCII symbol for the accidental in both cases. It&apos;s<br/>essentially only the nominals that change between the two. I&apos;ll use<br/>the 11-M-diesis below (as Herman does) but will use the sagittal<br/>symbols for it, whose ASCII shorthand are ^ and v. Here&apos;s a chain of<br/>porcupine generators showing both notations. If you&apos;re reading on the<br/>web, hit the Reply button to see it formatted correctly.</p><p>a^ b^ c^ d^ e^ f^ g^ a  b  c  d  e  f  g  av bv cv dv ev fv gv<br/>                     9--5--11-3--------1-----------------7<br/>A^ B C#v D^ E F#v G^ A  Bv C^ D  Ev F^ G  Av Bb^ C Dv Eb^ F Gv<br/>   |        |        |        |        |         |        |</p><p>Note that, in the second notation, C#v and F#v are equivalent to C^^<br/>and F^^. Similarly Eb^ and Bb^ are equivalent to Evv and Bvv.</p><p>I&apos;ve shown a slide-rule in between the two notations, that shows the<br/>11-limit ratio approximations. Below the second notation I&apos;ve<br/>indicated the nominals in their chain of fifths/fourths. Unfortunately<br/>only three of them are in the central 7-tone MOS. The whole sequence<br/>can be seen as 3 interleaved chains of fifths, in the second notation.</p><p>When you are told that in porcupine the 5-comma is the same as the<br/>11-M-diesis and the 7-comma vanishes, then you see that the second<br/>notation preserves the familiar notation of all the harmonic<br/>relationships.</p><p>Clearly the first notation has the advantage of fewer accidentals for<br/>someone who uses porcupine temperament a lot. But the second is likely<br/>to be more readily understood by someone who has to cope with a lot of<br/>different tunings, whether composer or performer or both.</p></div><h3><a id=50322 href="#50322">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2003 6:21:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;You&apos;re still thinking of ETs as the notation targets.
