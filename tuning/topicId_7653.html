Lpz.<br/>1681, erw. Quendlinburg 1698) nieder. In _musikalische Temperatur_ (Ffm. u.<br/>Lpz. 1686/87) beschreibt er f&#xFFFD;nf Temperierungen, die durch Verteilung des<br/>pythagoreischen Kommas entstehen; ein gleichschwebende Temperierung ist<br/>zuerst in den _Hypomnemata musica oder musicalisches Memorial_ (Quedlinburg<br/>1697) erw&#xFFFD;hnt.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere, one reads that</p><p>&quot;...schwankte er, ob die gleichschwebende oder die mittelt&#xFFFD;nige Temperatur<br/>den Vorzug verdiene.&quot;</p><p>So, Werckmeister&apos;s apparent lack of clarity on the subject is well-known.<br/>But this is only because the 2nd edition of the _Orgel-Probe_ postdates the<br/>_Hypomnemata_ by a year, giving one the impression that Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>opinion has shifted against the ET he had advocated the previous year.<br/>However, as his later publications support the position of the _Hypomenata_<br/>in favor of ET, it is probable that the _Orgel-Probe_ republication was<br/>simply not revised on this point.</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>1/8/2000 10:56:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree, Daniel that there is a lack of clarity, but it may be do to<br/>something other than Werckmeister&apos;s views.  People see different things in<br/>the very same materials.  I guess that blows the hopes I had in Husserlian<br/>intersubjectivity.</p><p>Now, the Orgel Probe would indicate &quot;organ&quot; instructions for tuning.  I have<br/>read that J.S. Bach did avoid the extreme keys when writing specifically for<br/>organ.  There may be a different set of concerns here.</p><p>In this same vein, Armin Schoof, organist of the Lubeck St. Jacobi Church<br/>with Buxtehude&apos;s very same Grosse and Kleine organs, often makes these kinds<br/>of choices.  Both of these organs (the same Bach walked to hear) are from the<br/>Middle Ages, but the larger is in 12TET.  The smaller, on the side of the<br/>resonant church, has apparently always been in Werckmeister III.  When<br/>recording Bach and Buxtehude in keys that are close to 12TET, he plays them<br/>on the Grosse (surely impressed also by the bigger sound).  When Mr. Schoof<br/>plays on the smaller organ it is for exquisite charm and pungent tone.  (You<br/>miss the power of the pedals of the larger organ).</p><p>As Werckmeister wrote Orgel Probe earlier, he may have felt that the rigidity<br/>of the organ and its societal role allowed for the relative conformity of<br/>12TET.  However, his ideas appear to be expansive enough to suggest a<br/>different model for his ideal temperament.  Considering that Werckmeister is<br/>holding a candle in the darkness about unequal circular tuning, I think any<br/>support he had for 12TET as all-inclusive was under duress.  Certainly, he<br/>used those particular keys of &quot;our tuning&quot; that mirror 12TET.  One simply<br/>doesn&apos;t go from variety to plain in the last 6 years of live...unless he<br/>became ill.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
