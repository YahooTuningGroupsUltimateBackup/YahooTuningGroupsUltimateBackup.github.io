If you can&apos;t swallow<br/>octave-equivalent formulations at all, you&apos;re missing out on something<br/>very useful, since it is often assumed that all octave-equivalents of<br/>all scale tones will be used. In that case, a formulation like mine<br/>treats them all at once.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Nothing&apos;s wrong with it, it&apos;s the mediant.
