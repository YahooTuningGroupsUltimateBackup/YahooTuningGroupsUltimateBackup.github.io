So i spent like two<br/>&gt; weeks bitching and complaining before i realised that if Scala made Midi<br/>&gt; files surely one could play the midi file into the module. I am so glad<br/>&gt; Darren was able to help you listers!</p><p>Yes, this was exactly MY problem as well... so it was great that Darren<br/>figured it out... It works great now, and it looks like Jacky Ligon has<br/>it working fine, too.  No more &quot;front panel&quot; squinting...</p><p>_____________ _____ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
