In other words, individuals are expected to contribute to the intonation of the ensemble as a whole, and are expected to discern the contextually appropriate intonation, be it precisely following one model or another (i.e. 12-tet in some cases, beatless triads and seventh chords in others).</p><p>In contrast, with the Javanese gamelan, if we may first distinguish those ensembles which are either understood to be out of tune or to have fallen out of tune with themselves (there are many; one of the best examples is Kyai Kanyut Mesem, which is a lovely old heirloom gamelan, but seriously out of tune, yet the complete tuning is described in MGG!) and those musicians who are relatively indifferent intonational precision (there are also many) from the gamelan ensembles and musicians recognized for their intonation.  A gamelan in good tune may have copied a famous orginal (although the degree of accuracy will vary, in some cases, sharing the tuning with only one pitch of the original is sufficient) or be a unique tuning.  The general principle, however, is to create a complete gestalt, if you will, beginning with a few fixed references, for example the gong (for both pitch and internal beating rate) or the kethuk, or pitch 6 of a well-known gamelan, typically that of RRI Solo, and then continuing to the gamelan as a whole.  The gender is tuned next, as it is the fixed pitch instrument which plays a significant number of dyads,  and does so that it plays well in all three pathet (= usually translated as mode but here actually more like key, with the tuning of the gender analogous to a temperament designed to play a scale type well and charcateristically in more than one transposition with a minimal number of keys).  Additional fixed pitch instruments are gradually added, again paying attention to the general gestalt, continuously rechecking.  Some pitches or some instruments are deliberately raised or lowered so as to be better heard in a dense ensemble texture and unisons between instruments are frequently (but not always) tuned so as to beat, typically at a rate similar to the internal beating of the gong, which in turn is close to the prevailing tempo of the irama system.  This beating of near-unisons is done chiefly by the louder instruments, the demungs and sarons which frequently come in pairs, for an increase in volume, brilliance, and a more lively tone, somewhat akin to the criteria used to justify vibrato in western playing, but this is, due to the permance of the metal, not an optional expressive feature but a built-in feature.  Finally, in performance, the variably-pitched instruments (voices, rebab (spike fiddle) and suling (fipple flute)) have, by nature, great flexibility in intonation, but they must remain recognizeably within the general tuning environment of the gamelan as well as the specific pathetan.  While in most cases, this is restricted to ornamentation, miring or &quot;minir&quot; pitches (which are between those in the gamelan), and some strategic use of sharp or flat playing so as to project through the ensemble, there are several leading, usually mature, musicians who are noted for the individuality (&quot;embat&quot;) of their intonation and tone quality and often play with and against the intonation of the ensemble for expression or color or general liveliness.</p><p>As Lou Harrison liked to point out, the orchestra is ensembled from musicians who own and bring their individual instruments with them while the gamelan is, at its best, tuned together as a single instrument which musicians gather to play.  There is one more critical difference, and that has to do with the substance of the instruments.  Western orchestras are, for the greatest part, composed of instruments with simple harmonic spectra, thus reinforcing considerable uniformity in intonation.  The harmonic series is almost always available, in some form, as a point of reference or even background radiation.  In contrast, the spectra of the idiophones in a gamelan is wildly variable (and can be dramatically changed by the slightest alterations in the shape of any of the single sounding bodies).  This variability permits a wider amount a variation in tuning than would be tolerable among western instruments and, I daresay, is one of the important factors in allowing the laras and pathet systems to have flowered.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>massimilianolabardi &#x3C;labardi@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2009 7:51:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ciao Claudio,</p><p>I have simply calculated the average deviation (Y) - that is,<br/>difference in cents between corresponding grades - over the whole<br/>diatonic major scale in JI and in 12-TET.
