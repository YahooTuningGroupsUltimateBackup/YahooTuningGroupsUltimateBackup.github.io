And as we know, his music (latter opus&apos;) dealt<br/>with the unique theoretical/philosophical approach of trying to avoid<br/>tonality with his serial techniques, using the 12tET pitch set.  This<br/>concept was anchored in this tuning system.  So with this in mind, I<br/>find it extremely difficult to be overly euphemistic with regard to<br/>imposing a tuning other than 12tET onto Big Daddy Schoenberg.</p><p>Follow me in this line of reasoning for a moment, by considering 2<br/>things:</p><p>1.  If one attempts to impose a JI quality onto this music, where its<br/>intention is to avoid the feeling of tonality, then &quot;distortion&quot; IMHO<br/>spells more accurately what&apos;s being done to Schoenberg&apos;s music.<br/>The &quot;Lense&quot; analogy again!</p><p>2.  If one wishes to &quot;help him along the way&quot; with a tuning system<br/>that would have surely been more beneficial to this already bizarre<br/>theory, then 13tET would be the perfect choice as far as avoidance of<br/>tonality (or perhaps an non-octave spiral tuning).  But then, one is<br/>confronted with the fact that Schoenberg&apos;s music used highly<br/>specialized 12tET set theory, with the 12 tone row, and also to<br/>impose this onto his music (forgive me Bob!), would also amount<br/>to &quot;distortion&quot; of the geometries of his theory.  This however would<br/>be the approach I would be most interested to hear - if Schoenberg<br/>wanted to avoid tonality, then supply his music with a tuning system<br/>with maximal tonal ambiguity, and PLEASE let me know when you&apos;ve got<br/>the midi file ready!</p><p>Just to clarify:</p><p>I have absolutely no issues with &apos;interpretation&apos; or &apos;realisation&apos;<br/>or &apos;rendering. I also have been an active improvising musician for<br/>most of my music life, so all you said was in resonance with me, but<br/>when we speak of re-tuning music which is inseparable from its tuning<br/>theory/set theory, then we tread a thin line between &quot;distortion&quot; and<br/>the more euphemistic choices of &apos;interpretation&apos; or &apos;realization&apos;<br/>or &apos;rendering.</p><p>I was attempting to also make a humorous point by asking how we might<br/>feel about our own cherished tuning/set concepts, being perverted by<br/>future microtonalists, who may gain a broader subjective vision of<br/>tuning theory in the current century.</p><p>The issue here made me think of a possibly interesting project for<br/>some. Why don&apos;t we write some pieces in 12tET and let others re-tune<br/>our work, as a form of collaboration?  Might be fun, but 12 is a<br/>little annoying on my ears these days.</p><p>Thanks for the input!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>P.S.

So with this in mind, I<br/>&gt; find it extremely difficult to be overly euphemistic with regard to<br/>&gt; imposing a tuning other than 12tET onto Big Daddy Schoenberg.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure about this, since Shoenberg made some claims about 12tet<br/>relationship to the harmonic series (claims which are not terribly<br/>good mathematically, but if thats the way the guy heard it, its fine<br/>with me). But thats beside the point.</p><p>I also don&apos;t think the early serialists were as enamoured with creating<br/>a &apos;statisticaly flat music&apos; or a &apos;mathematically perfect music&apos; as<br/>some of the later composers were.</p><p>I think that coming up with a system to avoid innapropriate tonality<br/>was just as needed for them as an abstract painter who moves back<br/>from a painting, says &apos;woops&apos; and fixes (or destroys) parts of the<br/>painting which are unintentionally representative.</p><p>It comes down to control of tension and release, and having sudden<br/>innapropriate tonal moments can ruin that control (as some errant<br/>blobs of paint which &apos;look like a horse smoking a pipe&apos; may suddenly<br/>neutralize the effectiveness of a painting titled &apos;misery&apos;).</p><p>Another thing is, in this music, although tonality is avoided, all<br/>other aspects of classical music are there. In particular, the<br/>language of &apos;dissonant&apos; intervals providing tension, and the classic<br/>simple intervals providing release is clearly there (of course, this<br/>is augmented by dynamic, tempo and timbral queues).</p><p>With this in mind, if the major seventh is supposed to be strident<br/>and the major third calm in a given section of a piece, then there<br/>may be nastier major sevenths than 2^(11/12), and there certainly is<br/>a calmer major third than 2^(4/12)!</p><p>&lt;snip of your pure JI and 13tet points&gt;</p><p>So you can see that I would probably choose neither extreme. Pure<br/>JI may dull the tense points, or create unexpected tension lessenning<br/>(a 15/8 major seventh may manage to express its simple components in<br/>context, in other words, be too simple a prime). And tuning in a<br/>completely aharmonic et will ruin the ability to get the proper amount<br/>of repose.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying this will really work, just that there is a very<br/>musical motivation to doing this sort of realisation.</p><p>On the other hand, I can see a lot of places where not obeying rules<br/>like &quot;D# = Eb and theres only one of them that is invariant throughout<br/>the piece&quot; may produce some results that do not match the intentions<br/>of the composer or, more importantly, the intent of the music.
