Make the whole thing regular 1/6, or make a Vallotti, or modify the Vallotti into a Young #1 (tweaking the F and B slightly), or whatever.</p><p>If you want an especially good F minor, finish it off with my main Bach recipe there.  From the E go in pure 5ths E-B-F#-C#, and then make the remaining 5ths C#-G#-D#-A# 1/12 each (i.e. in character only half as twangy as the starting 5ths).   With practice, an entire 8-foot register takes 10 minutes or less.  Check all your 4ths and 5ths for the right character, all the way up the treble, as a way to be sure you are getting pure octaves.</p><p>My new CDs include demonstration of F minor:</p><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cd1003.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cd1003.html</a><br/>prelude and fugue of WTC 1; three-part invention (sinfonia) BWV 795</p><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cd1002.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cd1002.html</a><br/>Jesus Christus unser Heiland, BWV 689; prelude and fugue in Fischer&apos;s _Ariadne musica_</p><p>Bradley Lehman</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2006 3:58:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone have a good tuning recipe for tuning 6th-comma meantone<br/>on a<br/>&gt; harpsichord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stipulation: it must play in F minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you very much in advance,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Two questions arise:</p><p>What technical method is to be used for the tuning - ear alone or<br/>electronic gizmos?</p><p>What composer&apos;s F minor is it, and does F minor include the chords of<br/>Ab and Db major?</p><p>Bear in mind that some composers would have written in F minor<br/>specifically to exploit some of the &apos;bad&apos; intervals in normal Eb-G#<br/>meantone.
