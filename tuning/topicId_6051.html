Even the *note* F is different<br/>from the 4/3 root of the basic subdominant triad. Also, I believe that<br/>C=63/64 would tend to loose the tonality of C=1/1. That is, if you sang D-7<br/>that way, I don&apos;t think it would be likely to get to the next chords as you<br/>indicate. Instead you might land in G7 with G=(3/2)*(63/64) and B, D, and F<br/>all lowered by 63/64, and then Cmaj7 would also be 63/64 of what you<br/>indicate.</p><p>&gt;...or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       16/9 C 1/1          5 B 15/8         15 B 15/8<br/>&gt;          3 A 27/16        1 G 3/2           3 G 3/2<br/>&gt;      32/27 F 4/3       16/9 F 4/3           5 E 5/4<br/>&gt;          1 D 9/8          3 D 9/8           1 C 1/1</p><p>Well, D-7 has fifths in tune but thirds out, so the F triad that is the<br/>basic subdominant chord in C major is out of tune. The G7 is possible but<br/>you&apos;d but I don&apos;t think good singers would produce that F.</p><p>&gt;...or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      9/5 C 1/1          5 B  15/8        15 B 15/8<br/>&gt;        3 A 5/3          1 G  3/2          3 G 3/2<br/>&gt;      6/5 F 4/3       16/9 F  4/3          5 E 5/4<br/>&gt;        1 D 10/9 -+22--- 3 D+ 9/8          1 C 1/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is what I expect except for the F in G7, for the same reason as in the<br/>example above.</p><p>&gt;Each one has different warps which may be more or less<br/>&gt;offensive depending on what the goal is.</p><p>I agree that the different options you listed would be more or less<br/>offensive, but is not necessary to make ANYTHING offensive in this simple<br/>progression!</p><p>&gt;I tend to think<br/>&gt;that the second option I pose is the most likely... It<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t require any drift,</p><p>You mean it doesn&apos;t require any *flexibility*. None of the examples drift<br/>(except that if you sang D-7 as in the first example you might not complete<br/>the sequence because of drift).</p><p>&gt;there is good tuning at the 3^n<br/>&gt;limits, and I don&apos;t think the 7/4 on a dominant chord<br/>&gt;is that important.</p><p>I consider your third option to be the least offensive. I&apos;d rather have my<br/>singers do that than either of the others. But they&apos;d still be out of tune!<br/>If you actually SANG an F in G7 as 16/9 relative to C then I suspect that<br/>you wouldn&apos;t make the cut at an audition for Gerald Eskelin&apos;s L.A. Jazz<br/>Choir, or any good barbershop quartet.</p><p>&gt; [I would contend that modal useage<br/>&gt;of the seventh chord is different, including &apos;the blues&apos;]</p><p>I&apos;m not yet prepared to write about the blues, but I will sometime soon.</p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p></div><h3>Paul H.

A slight<br/>exageration...</p><p>I believe in octave equivalence, which conjures up<br/>a vision of a strong &apos;pocket&apos; at 2^n ratios.</p><p>Whether my thinking is based on overtones, prime or odd<br/>limits, 3/2^n has a very strong pocket.</p><p>(Of course these results are right in line with the<br/>harmonic entropy graphs you produced).</p><p>A prime limit thinker would say that &quot;a 3 of a 3&quot; will<br/>also have a strong pocket. The first of these is 9/8<br/>which is strong from an overtone series point of<br/>view. [I suppose a test is to place tones between<br/>9/8 and 8/7 and see if there is a stronger attraction<br/>to one or the other].</p><p>So, my statement was basically saying, that lots of<br/>fifths were in tune, and lots of &quot;fifths of fifths&quot; were<br/>in tune, so the whole scale sat in a lot of overtone and<br/>prime limit pockets.</p><p>The examples discussed in that thread may have been flawed<br/>since we were discussing a scale as if it were being sung<br/>or perceived by the singers as a cluster. Jim tended to<br/>think they would tune all notes to an overtone series from<br/>the root of the chord, I thought they would fall into the<br/>various &quot;fifths and major triads pockets&quot; that were also<br/>in the sound.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I have seen no evidence in any psychoacoustic<br/>model of consonance, whether based on roughness, harmonic entropy, or<br/>combination tones, to suggest that ratios of higher powers of low primes<br/>could be more consonant that ratios of lower numbers based on higher primes.<br/>Certainly one will find the former in many chords built mainly of consonant<br/>intervals, but if you compare the intervals themselves, and really try to<br/>listen for &quot;objective&quot; dissonance, I think you&apos;ll find that I&apos;m right.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
