If I knew...perhaps I could try....</p><p>   Once thing I found myself is that the harmonic series partials about about x/9 (IE 10/9 11/9, etc.) are about the smallest set you can put next to each other before dissonance starts really creeping in.   Note most of my latest scales use little more than a 9 denominator IE &quot;x/9&quot; format for the fractions.  The fractions obtained seemed to confirm this: the highest denominator that appears in the graph is a 9 (13/9, 17/9).   I think just-intonation diatonic actually goes astray because when you look at</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 you notice the smallest gap between tones is 15/14 (and 14 is a lot more than 9).</p><p>     One thing to consider....a lot can go wrong soon as you try a chord without 1/1 as the root.  Also the triad DFA, for example, is 9/8 4/3 5/3...which can only be summarized at 27/24 32/24 40/24 (24 is obviously far more than the 9 denominator &quot;goal&quot;).  Taking ratios directly from the graph the scale I can form</p><p>7:4  =  1.75<br/>5:3  =  1.6666666666666<br/>3:2  =  1.5<br/>4:3   = 1.3333333333333<br/>5:4   = 1.25<br/>7:6   = 1.166666666<br/>1:1</p><p>.......seems like a much better alternative as everything reduces to x/12 and not x/24.  My guess is around that set of notes would be what you got if you used, say, 7 sine waves instead of 2 for the test.   One problem though (IMVHO)...7:6, 5:4, and 4:3 (plus 7:4 and 5:3) are too close to use consecutively in chords...so IMVHO it still isn&apos;t quite ideal because it does not deal well with the roughness issue for those notes.   Sure seems to give a lot of (according to JI) possible perfect triads, though....</p><p>    One thing I&apos;ve found is that making a scale with either a lowest common denominator of 2 or 3 between fractions (IE 3/2 4/3 15/8) works well to maximize the number of just triads possible...but anything with two tones closer than about 12/11 from each other (roughness) starts to sound bad.  Sure a note at15/8 sounds good next to 8/8...but put the octave as a third note in the chord and it sounds very rough (minor second interval).</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Wed, January 13, 2010 3:42:24 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Some new? stuff on wikipedia</p><p>Have you seen this audio spectrum?</p><p><a href="http://upload">http://upload</a>. wikimedia. org/wikipedia/ commons/f/ f9/Dissonance- a220-a440- notated.jpg</p><p>in article</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance</a></p><p>It is a graph that shows the spectra created when two sine waves are diverged from the unison to the octave.<br/>Major intervals are notated.</p><p>I&apos;d love to see the same with 3 tones.</p><p>Chris</p></div><h3><a id=85678 href="#85678">ðŸ”—</a>sevishmusic &#x3C;sevish@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2010 4:40:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The picture is beautiful!

At<br/>the points where the ratios of the frequencies of the tones are simpler<br/>(indicated by arrows near the top of the graph), the overtones as observed<br/>in the spectral analysis are more ordered and simple.

What<br/>it means is, if you plug your guitar into an amp and crank the distortion up<br/>to 11 -- and you make your guitar strings output sinusoidal tones instead of<br/>complex tones (turn that tone knob all the way down!) -- the graph posted<br/>corresponds roughly to the intervals which would sound most or least<br/>&quot;coherent.&quot;</p><p>As you might have noticed, this doesn&apos;t quite correspond perfectly to real<br/>life - a maj7 chord sounds beautiful on a piano, but with guitar distortion,<br/>it&apos;s a total mess.

If there are overtones, then these are not (quite)<br/>sinusoids. The fact that you&apos;ve got lines going up and down at the<br/>same time means that there is significant aliasing, too. This is<br/>because the tones were generated in Cool Edit, which does a &quot;naive&quot;<br/>waveform generation instead of a bandlimited waveform. This seems to<br/>be the reason for the pronounced effect at consonances, not the<br/>consonance itself. I&apos;m not sure if these bands are actually even due<br/>to consonance, or if they&apos;re due to the waveform frequency being a<br/>submultiple of the sampling frequency at those points.&quot;</p><p>He thinks it&apos;s due to aliasing. I disagree, and think it has to do<br/>more with harmonic distortion.

It could show places to look for triads or represent some knowledge<br/>that has been ascertained to this point empirically. To my knowledge no one<br/>has been able to represent a series of triads (or more pitches) in an easy<br/>to understand graphical representation of the interaction of the constituent<br/>pitches.

This happens whether your signal consists of two sinusoids, two sinusoids that have been run through a distortion pedal, or clipped, or had something special done to them in the ear, or what not. It is on this level that something much closer to actual &quot;consonance&quot; resides.</p><p>For the record, there are, in certain circumstances, nonlinearities that can occur in the ear -- but as I said above, all they do is simply add more sinusoids to the equation. It still takes your brain to make sense of everything, split the signal into multiple sources, and perform a scene analysis on everything coming in.</p><p>As for this:</p><p>&gt; Does this imply then - since  the Sethares &quot;custom  timbre for a<br/>tuning works&quot;, that the &quot;autocorrelation&quot; occurs for non-octave based<br/>harmonic spectra as well?</p><p>&gt; I am understanding your position as &quot;we don&apos;t know the why of dissonance / consonance. &quot; Am I correct?</p><p>Right. We aren&apos;t quite sure exactly HOW this periodicity- finder in the brain works, but the most modern theory AFAIK is that some kind of autocorrelation is being done within the auditory nerve (so that it originates in the ear).</p><p>From a signal processing standpoint, I&apos;m not sure exactly HOW this would answer the entire question, since autocorrelation is a linear process (read: NOT nonlinear, produces NO distortion) and so would never produce a &quot;phantom fundamental&quot; or anything like that.</p><p>I attribute this to a lack of understanding on my part, however, as I am not well read on the most recent research into autocorrelation. Perhaps the use of the term &quot;autocorrelation&quot; is just a metaphor. But whatever this mysterious autocorrelation mechanism is, it can indeed detect pseudo-harmonic relationships as well as perfect harmonic relationships. In the literature I believe that they are referred to as &quot;pseudo-periodicitie s,&quot; and I was reading an interesting study a while ago about how certain types of periodic noise can fool the ear into thinking the fundamental is an octave higher or lower (I don&apos;t remember which) than it really is, since this mechanism is apparently easily fooled into thinking that the pseudo-periodicitie s are actually real periodicities.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Jan 14, 2010 at 12:16 AM, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@ <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Mike B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not sure how that relates to the graph we are discussing per se.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But it did give me this thought:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does this imply then - since  the Sethares &quot;custom  timbre for a tuning works&quot;, that the &quot;autocorrelation&quot; occurs for non-octave based harmonic spectra as well?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am understanding your position as &quot;we don&apos;t know the why of dissonance / consonance. &quot; Am I correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Its late for me - thanks for the link - see you all tomorrow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Chris<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;On Wed, Jan 13, 2010 at 11:58 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@ <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Chris,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The fact that that graphic coincides with small-integer JI ratios is<br/>&gt;&gt;why people at one point thought nonlinearities were responsible for our<br/>&gt;&gt;perception of consonance.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This concept that harmonic distortion (perhaps occuring in the ear) are at the root of consonance has been disproven for years and years now.

Thus while distortion may not create the missing fundamental, it may clarify it.<br/>C) What if the brain is perfectly OK with more than one missing fundamental for each chord...so long as those fundamentals have a low-integer-fraction relationship to each other?<br/>D) What if the brain is perfectly OK with more than one missing fundamental for each chord...so long as those fundamentals are symmetrical to each other (IE 3 where the third splits the other two in the middle where one half of the area is 1.618 times the size of the other, 2.414 times the size of the other (Silver Ratio), etc.</p><p>    IMVHO, the brain may simply look for patterns to help it categorize...and the harmonic series (and certainly not only 100% perfect ratios from the series) are almost certainly not the only cue the brain can use to organize sounds.</p><p>    Mike B, I&apos;d be interested to see you explain this (if it turns out exact periodicity is by and far the only way the brain can categorize tones):</p><p>    The following scale has a boat-load of by-harmonic-series perfect triads<br/>1/1<br/>7/6<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>5/3<br/>7/4<br/>2/1</p><p>      This next one is a result of a distorted waveform of a scale with far less perfect triads possible</p><p>   1<br/>   1.12626262<br/>   1.25252525<br/>   1.37878787<br/>   1.50505050<br/>   1.6717171<br/>   1.83838383<br/>   2</p><p>    Now...try playing each with sine waves and creating a bunch of chords (esp. ones with 5+ notes per octave).<br/>Which scale sounds better to you?</p></div><h3><a id=85723 href="#85723">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2010 1:18:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>&gt; You seem to be saying as far as I can tell that if a tool doesn&apos;t explain everything then it explains nothing.

I am at this point very curious as to the identity of some of the other &quot;resonance points&quot; that seem apparent in the graph.

It could show places to look for triads or represent some knowledge that has been ascertained to this point empirically. To my knowledge no one has been able to represent a series of triads (or more pitches) in an easy to understand graphical representation of the interaction of the constituent pitches.
