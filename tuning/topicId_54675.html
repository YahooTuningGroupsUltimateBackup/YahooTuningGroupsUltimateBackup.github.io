In his calculations<br/>he often substitutes the actual resulting ratios with their nearest<br/>epimores. For example: One would expect that the 7-limit lattice coordinates<br/>of &quot;(1, 0, 3)&quot; comes out as 1029/1024. Instead, he puts the result as<br/>206/205. An unaware reader might think: &quot;Is that a mistake?&quot; Not a mistake,<br/>just the nearest epimoric factor. Fokker goes on like this almost allover<br/>the article. Even instead of 2048/2025 for the diaschisma, he writes 89/88<br/>(that is pretty close indeed). After I reached the end of the paper, I tried<br/>to think a bit about Fokker&apos;s ideas once again. Suddenly I realized a<br/>strange coincidence between the way he approximated intervals there and the<br/>way I used to simplify my calculations some time ago. I think it could be<br/>quite useful to say something more about this in the following text.<br/>    As far as I could find out, it was in March 2002 when I first described<br/>an interval in a way I&apos;ve never seen before. And I often used this method<br/>again since. The value used for this is what I call &quot;ED&quot; (or &quot;Epimoric<br/>Denominator&quot;). You can convert a linear factor to ED by doing &quot;ED = 1/(F-1)&quot;<br/>(where F is the factor) and the opposite by &quot;F = (ED+1)/ED&quot;. It shows how<br/>close a factor is to an epimoric ratio. If the factor itself is actually<br/>epimoric, then ED is the denominator and therefore an integer. If ED is not<br/>an integer, then the interval is either not epimoric or not JI at all.<br/>Nonetheless, it always serves as a possible denominator for a ratio with the<br/>numerator exactly 1 higher, no matter if integer or not. And this is the<br/>main thing that&apos;s so important about ED. For example: ED for an octave is 1<br/>(i.e. the factor = 2/1), ED for a fifth is 2 (i.e. the factor is 3/2), ED<br/>for a major sixth is 1.5 (i.e. &quot;5/3&quot; is the same as &quot;2.5/1.5&quot;). As you can<br/>see, the smaller the interval, the larger the ED (i.e. the closer to<br/>Infinity). In fact, a unison can&apos;t be expressed as ED at all (this would<br/>require a value of 1/0). But it does not need to be a rational number.<br/>Though ED is mainly useful for comparing JI intervals, it can, of course,<br/>describe simply any possible interval you just think of. Moreover, it can<br/>also distinguish between raising and lowering intervals. While a major third<br/>upwards has an ED of 4 (i.e. the factor is 5/4), the ED for a major third<br/>downwards is -5 (i.e. &quot;4/5&quot; is the same as &quot;(-4)/(-5)&quot;). Working with ED can<br/>be useful in various situations. First of all, if you consider the ED to be<br/>an absolute frequency in Hz, adding a tone 1Hz higher makes the desired<br/>interval. That&apos;s why one can make a good image about the interval quite<br/>nicely. For example: The regular 5-limit schisma has an ED of ~885.62162<br/>(quite a large value and therefore just a small detuning), while the ED for<br/>the Pythagorean comma is ~73.29624 (a significantly smaller value so the<br/>detuning is remarcably stronger). Next, ED can help in finding the part by<br/>which to alter the frequency in order the tone would rise or fall by the<br/>given interval. The part in question is nothing else than the inversion<br/>(i.e. the reciprocal) of the ED. For example: A major third upwards has an<br/>ED of 4, while a major third downwards has an ED of -5. That means that a<br/>tone gets a major third higher if you increase the frequency by its 1/4,<br/>while decreasing the frequency by its 1/5 shifts the tone a major third<br/>lower. Okay, let&apos;s stop talking about the usefulness of ED. Now the main<br/>question - why do I say all this? At the time I first used ED, I found no<br/>resources showing any evidence of such a system used earlier by someone<br/>else. So I thought I just devised something new. And now, two years later, a<br/>surprise is here. Though Fokker limits his epimoric approximations just to<br/>integer epimores, his concept of substituting intervals with epimores is<br/>very similar to ED. If it is like this, I can nothing but wonder if<br/>something like ED was ever used even earlier.<br/>    A good way of averaging JI intervals is to take their EDs and find the<br/>arithmetic mean of these. The result will then be used as the ED for the<br/>average interval. You can also get the same result by converting the linear<br/>factors to fractions with always the same difference between &quot;num&quot; and &quot;den&quot;<br/>and then finding the arithmetic mean of these. For example: To average 3/1<br/>and 2/1 this way, you can either use the arithmetic mean of 0.5 and 1 as the<br/>resulting ED of 0.75, or convert the factors to 6/2 and 8/4 and then do the<br/>simple average (i.e. between 2 and 4 is 3, between 6 and 8 is 7, so between<br/>6/2 and 8/4 is 7/3). After consulting this with Manuel, I finally agreed to<br/>call it &quot;epimoric mean&quot; for using in Scala. But, as the time passes, I got a<br/>strange impression (which I just can&apos;t get out of my mind) that I must have<br/>read somewhere about a thing called &quot;partial mean&quot; which was exactly this<br/>(i.e. between 2/1 and 5/3 is 9/5 because it&apos;s the same as between 8/4 and<br/>10/6). Maybe some of you could help me. Do you think the term &quot;partial mean&quot;<br/>is my invention, or was it perhaps already known earlier? Thanks.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=54681 href="#54681">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2004 1:34:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&oslash;&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Suddenly I realized a<br/>&gt; strange coincidence between the way he approximated intervals there<br/>and the<br/>&gt; way I used to simplify my calculations some time ago.</p><p>The way he is doing it, so far as I can tell, is to take the last<br/>convergent of the continued fraction which is an epimore.

Yes, I more or<br/>less mean it to be used like this. As you can see from my previous message,<br/>I see the main &quot;plus&quot; of ED in the fact that it does not have to be an<br/>integer and therefore not only epimores can be measured as EDs but also any<br/>other intervals. This could help, for example, to examine the properties of<br/>some equal tunings for intervals not too far from epimores. I don&apos;t think I<br/>need to mention again the way ED can help in shifting a tone by a desired<br/>interval, I&apos;ve written about it in my previous text. Moreover, I often find<br/>the &quot;partial mean&quot; useful when generating intervals with a &quot;ring modulator&quot;<br/>or effects like that. Let&apos;s give an example here. If the carrier input is a<br/>sine wave of 400Hz and the modulator is a sine of 100Hz, the output contains<br/>two sines mixed of 300Hz and 500Hz (i.e. the difference and the sum). So I<br/>get a major sixth as a result. Now I&apos;ll shift the carrier frequency 100Hz<br/>higher  (i.e. to 500Hz) and leave the modulator unchanged. What I get then<br/>is a perfect fifth of 400Hz and 600Hz. When I set the carrier frequency<br/>right in-between (i.e. to 450Hz), I get 350Hz and 550Hz as the result. So<br/>indeed, the partial mean between 5/3 and 3/2 is 11/7 as it is the same as<br/>between 10/6 and 12/8. Yet one other<br/>thing is here to be said. I never tried to find out how many people were<br/>given the ability to distinguish absolute pitches just by ear. But since I<br/>was lucky enough to be one of these, I often find it useful to imagine an<br/>examined interval as a<br/>pair of two particular tones. In the case of intervals like dieses or<br/>commas, the ED value can easily be used as an absolute frequency of a tone<br/>in the range of human hearing. Then the numerator is exactly 1Hz higher so<br/>it will always make beats one per second. And it&apos;s quite clear that low<br/>tones have to be detuned more than the higher ones in order to get a beat<br/>rate of one per second. So in this case it helps me a lot because I just<br/>think of a tone that comes out as the ED and imagine some beats added to it<br/>with a rate of 1 per second. For example, if the ED is close to 100, I just<br/>know: &quot;Aha, it&apos;s something like 101/100. And 100Hz is a bit higher than G2.&quot;<br/>So I imagine a tone a bit higher than G2 with the beats of one per second.<br/>And it&apos;s quite clear that adding beats to a tone of around 100Hz makes a<br/>different sound than adding beats to a tone of around, I don&apos;t know, 960Hz,<br/>for example.<br/>Some more ideas?<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=54706 href="#54706">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2004 3:14:48 AM</span><button style="float: right;
