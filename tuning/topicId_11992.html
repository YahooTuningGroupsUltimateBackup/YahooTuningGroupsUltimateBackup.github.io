Please let me<br/>apologize in advance for any omissions or oversights, since _everyone_<br/>here is important in helping to give our community its unique<br/>qualities.</p><p>Thank you, Alison Monteith, for a very moving and engaging account of<br/>the Edinburgh Festival. How important it is to realize the special<br/>beauty of live performers and ensembles negotiating tunings without<br/>benefit of a table of fixed pitches. Your report conveys both the<br/>beauty of the music and the art of its interpreters. I&apos;m excited to<br/>see medieval composers such as Machaut being both performed and<br/>listened to with a special appreciation for intonation. As you<br/>observe, medieval sonorities can indeed be &quot;crunchy&quot; -- a theme tying<br/>in with a post by Dave Keenan also.</p><p>Thank you, Monz, for your response to my article on 29-tet and the<br/>question of interpreting Marchettus of Padua; I&apos;m delighted that your<br/>response provided an occasion for posting a link to your materials on<br/>Marchettus, something I should have included in my original post. Of<br/>course, I understand that you are involved now with  _really_ early<br/>music (e.g. Sumer and Babylon), in contrast to the 14th-century<br/>&quot;moderns&quot; (indeed known by that name at the time). Since the<br/>mathematics of the _Lucidarium_ are subject to many interpretations,<br/>the ear and perspective of the commentator may be a decisive<br/>factor. The idea of a cadential major sixth equally far from a fifth<br/>or an octave does very much grab my attention, however literally or<br/>otherwise this can/should be read.</p><p>Thank you, Robert C. Valentine, for a really creative and provocative<br/>idea about a piece (maybe a &quot;crab canon&quot; as you propose, or a<br/>&quot;palindrome&quot; like Machaut&apos;s _En ma fin mon commencement_) shifting<br/>from a &quot;reverse meantone&quot; or hypermeantone to a usual meantone. The<br/>idea of reversing the cadential logic is a _very_ ingenious one. Maybe<br/>especially as you shift to the realm around 19-tet, the more tense<br/>quality of fifths _could_ suggest a kind of &quot;resolution&quot; to thirds.<br/>The idea of the graduated shifting of the temperament as the piece<br/>proceeds, and the reversed positions of flats and sharps to match the<br/>reversed motion, is something really intriguing.</p><p>This does suggest the kind of musical subtlety practiced by a Solage<br/>or Ockeghem, and if the discussion of neo-Gothic styles leads to this<br/>kind of exploration of hybrid forms and styles, I&apos;m really excited.<br/>May the experiment -- or maybe many experiments -- fulfill the<br/>high conception.</p><p>Thank you, Jacky Ligon, for many remarks about tuning, and especially<br/>your comments on the 13:10. To me, also, it tends at least in the<br/>contexts I find myself using it (or actually its close approximation<br/>at 11/29 octave or 9/24 octave) to be a kind of very wide major third.<br/>However, maybe my usage defines this perception: &quot;if it&apos;s unstable and<br/>resolves to a fifth by stepwise contrary motion, then it sounds like a<br/>major third because it acts like one.&quot; Sometimes it can have a<br/>captivating ambiguity: &quot;We&apos;ve warped into a new musical space<br/>somewhere between or beyond the 14th and 20th centuries, progressions<br/>are curiously &apos;blurred&apos; and still beautiful, so enjoy it.&quot;</p><p>Thank you, Dave Keenan, for your remarks on &quot;crunchiness&quot;; my first<br/>response is that a usual 243:128 might epitomize crunchiness for me,<br/>and composers such as Perotin certainly know how to use it, although<br/>my use now and then of an approximation of 11:8 in certain cadences<br/>might be closer to the kind of intervals you mainly have in mind. By<br/>the way, please let me thank you for your germinal articles on regular<br/>tunings with one or two chains of fifths, vital sources for so much of<br/>what I&apos;m now about, including some recent articles on neo-Gothic<br/>hypermeantones.</p><p>Thank you, &quot;Troubledoor,&quot; for what might be considered a prophetic<br/>comment about &quot;hybrid scales.&quot; While I find 24 notes of Pythagorean or<br/>29-tone equal temperament (29-tet) a very practical set -- people may<br/>find their mileage varies here depending on questions of musical style<br/>and outlook -- the idea of mixing hybrid tunings can have lots of<br/>possibilities. Maybe a tuning like 34-tet (which could be analyzed as<br/>two 17-tet chains) is one form of such hybridization -- and likewise<br/>22-tet as two sets of 11-tet.</p><p>Thank you, Paul Erlich, for your great well-temperament riddle. I<br/>didn&apos;t get it (until after reading your solution), but the exercise in<br/>combination with a point you made in a dialogue we had about<br/>17th-century music some months ago has spurred me on to something I&apos;m<br/>really looking forward to sharing. Also, I would like to record some<br/>of my neo-Gothic improvisations and the like -- finding a balance<br/>between theorizing and practicing. Sometimes I need to exercise a bit<br/>of patience and persistence in getting my fingering up to my musical<br/>intentions. Your articles and dialogue have immensely enriched this<br/>experience, in theory and practice alike; I&apos;m still admiring your<br/>Aeolian tour de force in 22-tet.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2000 1:00:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo,</p><p>Thanks for the acknowledgement in your post to the List<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11992">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11992</a></p><p>I&apos;m writing this mainly because I just sent another &apos;Solar System&apos;<br/>post:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11995">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11995</a></p><p>in which I used the phrase &apos;your mileage may vary&apos; in discussing<br/>my inability to hear the lowest and highest notes, and absolutely<br/>can&apos;t believe that now I see that you just used the same phrase<br/>in your post!</p><p>Talk about synchronicity!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
