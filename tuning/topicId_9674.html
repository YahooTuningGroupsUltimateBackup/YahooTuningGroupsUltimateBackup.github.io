Here is the beginning of<br/>a table of the harmonic series (through the 31st) with the non-octave<br/>pitches divided down to their familiar form:<br/>1/1<br/>2/1, 3/2<br/>4/1, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4<br/>8/1, 9/8, 5/4, 11/8, 3/2, 13/8, 7/4, 15/8<br/>16/1 17/16, 9/8, 19/16, 5/4, 21/16, 11/8, 23/16, 3/2, 25/16, 13/8, 27/16, 7/4,<br/>     29/16, 15/8, 31/16<br/>32/1, 33/32, 17/16, etc</p><p>It is just a point about semantics or terminology. The number of<br/>harmonic series pitches that divide down to the octave doubles each<br/>octave, so you can actually go up quite high in the harmonic series while<br/>staying in the range of human hearing. Low A on my piano is 55Hz, and with<br/>88 keys I have 1+1+2+4+8+16+32+64=128 harmonics from the series<br/>represented up to high A. For some kinds of music these may be useful<br/>harmonized with low A, but usually we are not talking about the _actual_<br/>pitches from the series harmonized with their generators, but an octave<br/>equivalent.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
