Though Werckmeister claimed his temperament (as it was also<br/>known) was a natural consequence of Praetorian (read quarter-comma meantone)<br/>tuning.  Rather than split keys for more pitches like Michael Praetorious and<br/>Georg Frederick Handel preferred, Werckmeister argued for keeping only 12 for<br/>techniques sake.  He didn&apos;t want to disenfranchise some of the chromatics<br/>over more basic notes.</p><p>Also, Werckmeister never claimed invention.  He was aware of it being in<br/>regular practice in Thuringia.  Johann Cristoph Bach, J.S. Bach&apos;s uncle who<br/>lived next door in Eisenach, was likely using it before J.S.  Interestingly,<br/>J.C. Bach was born the same year as Werckmeister, 1645, right after the<br/>plague and at the end of the 30 Years War.  It&apos;s likely J.C. Bach was<br/>acquainted with Werckmeister and met up in Muhlhausen when Werckmeister was<br/>studying Latin for 2 years in Nordhausen.  Independent city Muhlhausen was<br/>the great get away city for the Bachs of Eisenach.</p><p>It seems to me that the Bachs did not criticize Werckmeister at all.  With<br/>lots of stated criticism coming from all directions, the fact that J.S. Bach<br/>borrowed Werckmeister&apos;s term &quot;Wohl temperirt&quot; for the well-tempered clavier<br/>is certainly honorific.</p><p>Wow, 39 intervals at the melodic threshold...Manual...I&apos;m still amazed!</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Best.
