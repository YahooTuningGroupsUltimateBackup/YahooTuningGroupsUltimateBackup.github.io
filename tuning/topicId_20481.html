The<br/>article states that it&apos;s ...&quot;a condition that can take a multitude of<br/>forms. Some synesthetes see sounds, while others feel colors or taste<br/>shapes.&quot; And later, a researcher says...&quot;We&apos;ve ruled out that these<br/>people are simply telling tall tales.&quot; It appears Scriabin had this<br/>condition, and so did Messaien, who said...&quot;Whenever I hear music, or<br/>even if I read music, I see colors...The piece I composed about Bryce<br/>Canyon is red and orange, the color of the cliffs.&quot;<br/>    Very common among these folks is seeing colors associated with<br/>letters or numbers; but, some people even feel shapes and textures<br/>pressing on their skin while viewing objects. It&apos;s really fascinating<br/>stuff, and not at all nailed down by the researchers. To me, it<br/>certainly points out the non logical, mysterious nature of life and the<br/>Universe...it also has strong implications for art and creativity.

The light show just made those ephemeral<br/>sensations a manifest part of the performance.</p><p>I believe you&apos;re right about Scriabin.  Since I&apos;ve studied<br/>Schoenberg so much, I feel compelled to add that he too was<br/>tapping into this phenomenon.  A few years after he started<br/>painting, he became good friends with Wasily Kandinsky, who<br/>had theories about how colors and emotions related together.</p><p>Schoenberg believed that this also included the feelings<br/>we get when hearing sounds.  He incorporated very specific<br/>directions about lighting, including even a &quot;color crescendo&quot;<br/>at one point, in his opera _Die Glueckliche Hand_ (1908-13),<br/>yet another piece of his that was *way* ahead of its time.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=20486 href="#20486">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

If one of us can&apos;t think of the name of a song, we can usually<br/>get the other one to think of it by saying something like, &quot;You know, the one by so-and-so that<br/>starts out blue green and then gets kind of orange in the choruses.&quot;  I should say, it&apos;s not a strong<br/>sensation, like looking at a photo.  And it&apos;s not associated with any particular shape(s).  For me,<br/>at least, it&apos;s something I&apos;m not consciously aware of unless I choose to be.  But it is a specific<br/>sensation.  The shades of color are as specific as those seen with the eye.  Also, individual timbres<br/>have colors for me, which helps in mixing music to achieve spectral balance.  Sometimes a tuning<br/>will, but most tunings offer a range of colors that blend in various ways when used in a piece of<br/>music.  I suspect that I tap into that sense in some way when I compose or improvise, and that I use<br/>it to evaluate what a tuning might be good for.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Syntsthesia is very, very mych a part of my makeup. However,<br/>haveing never even had light perception, it takes the form of tactile<br/>textures and, well, a sorta mood/atmosphere combination. One ammusing<br/>feature of it is that, since I&apos;ve long associated tonalities i.e. A minor,<br/>D flat major etc. with various feelings, the relatively late introduction<br/>to my sensorium of things microtonal produces some wonderful ambivalences<br/>in the scheme. In music that partakes of other than 12tet I gradually<br/>develop variations and occasionally, entirely new atmospheres and I become<br/>aware even more of the changes in these that accompany harmonic<br/>progressions.l<br/>Tactile images are governed both by harmonic structures and register. It<br/>took me a long time to feel comfortable with Beethoven&apos;s piano writing cuz<br/>those grungy chords way down in the bass felt like a hard massage with<br/>gravel, and I wasn&apos;t sure I liked that. So there&apos;s a brief summary of my<br/>experience with synesthesia, and yes, I&apos;d feel terribly impoverished (an F<br/>minor dirge, maybe) if it went away.<br/>Jay</p></div>
