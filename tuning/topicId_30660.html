What I haven&apos;t seen in many books on<br/>tuning/theory, is the connection of these issues to a broader picture,<br/>the integration of tuning/music into, shall we say, more spiritual<br/>concepts. In Indian music, for example, being a musician is recognized<br/>as a path to the Creator, a way to achieve inner realization. I believe<br/>that Pythagoras did not separate his musical teachings from his<br/>spiritual teachings, and as has been stated here before, many cultures<br/>around the world see music/sound as a basic component of the Universal<br/>structure. Of course, numbers and their mystical significance are a<br/>basic part of most all world religious views, from the ancient Jewish<br/>teachings to the Chinese to the Masons. Thus,<br/>music/tunings/math/mysticism (for lack of a better word) are rather<br/>closely tied together; but, in many books on tuning, we don&apos;t get much<br/>talk about the more intuitive side of things. That&apos;s why Danielou&apos;s<br/>&quot;Music and the Power of Sound&quot; is one of my favorite reads on the<br/>subject; he does connect the issue of music/tuning to a much bigger<br/>framework, and rightly so. I just picked up another book that leans that<br/>direction, by Dane Rudhyar: &quot;The Magic of Tone and the Art of Music;&quot;<br/>but, I&apos;ve just begun to glance at it, so cannot comment in depth yet. I<br/>would like to see more emphasis placed on the spiritual component of<br/>music (and all art), because in the long run, it&apos;s the depth of feeling<br/>in a piece of music that<br/>makes it what it is. And, I believe that the study of tunings, and their<br/>deeper meanings, can add a lot to a composer&apos;s ability to create<br/>profound and meaningful art. When, of course, that study is combined<br/>with strong compositional skills, and a gift for shaping those tunings<br/>into great works of art...Hstick</p></div>
