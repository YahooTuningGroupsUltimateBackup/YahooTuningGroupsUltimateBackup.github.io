I think you often make interesting scales :-).</p><p>I&apos;d say your tuning is a lyrical one , at least I found it so. I wonder if one can maybe say that certain scales are on islands of lyricism, by analogy with the islands of stability in the periodic table, then one can ask if they are on the same island or the same archipelago, though I don&apos;t know how one would answer. I noticed yours has a third tone sized semitone though don&apos;t know if there are any other resemblances to 17-et.</p><p>It is interesting that a fair  number of people independently can come up with  a feeling that a tuning is particularly lyrical. I came to that conclusion myself about 17-et as a result of trying it out a few years ago independently of what anyone else has said, and it seems that others have found it so too, if not necessarily everyone.</p><p>One idea I have is that sometimes if a piece is composed in one tuning and then played in a quite different tuning, perhaps sometimes something of the flavour of the one can carry through into the other, just because the original piece was written for that particular tuning, so I suppose the composer makes particular choices based on the tuning that it originated in, different perhaps from the ones one might make in the tuning it is played in finally.</p><p>I had a go at retuning it to 17-et - a similarly sized semitone though not otherwise very close, anyway, this is the mode I used, closest to your scale:<br/>0 3 4 6 7 10 13 14 17<br/>and here is the result:<br/><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/kirkwood_gaps_nearest_17-et.mid">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/kirkwood_gaps_nearest_17-et.mid</a><br/>Compare:<br/><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/kirkwood_gaps.mid">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/kirkwood_gaps.mid</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=67771 href="#67771">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2006 1:06:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I had a go at retuning it to 17-et - a similarly sized semitone<br/>though not otherwise very close, anyway, this is the mode I used,<br/>closest to your scale:<br/>&gt; 0 3 4 6 7 10 13 14 17<br/>&gt; and here is the result:</p><p>Here are retunings to 31, 34 (the sharp 7 version), 46, 68, and 99,<br/>as well as the JI original.

I liked  the 99 too.</p><p>Surely the point in the paper is that 17-et is a special tuning with its own characteristics. Part of the appeal, apart from the lyricism, is the way that ones expectations are somewhat turned on their heads, so that the major third is no longer an important consonance, and that possibly even depending how one composed, the fifth even needn&apos;t be so much the most important structuring element as it is in some other tunings - because since it is a prime  number, any of the intervals will make a complete cycle, and the fifth is no longer necessarily the only one to use.</p><p>I get the impression there are several strands to microtonal interest, and one starts with common practice music and one is looking for tunings to explore the same kinds of chords and progressions, but better tuned than in 12-et or else to bring out particular characteristics - or maybe  one has things like using septimal intervals, but still basically the same kind of harmonic ethos in a way. Or the other approach is that one is interested in tunings that turn ones expectations on their head so that one needs to start with a new framework, or start from scratch, which some find enjoyable (and others maybe aren&apos;t trained enough in the common practice music to have such a big transition to make anyway).</p><p>So - for instance if one wanted  everything turned on its head one might be interested in 7-et maybe, or 11-et 13-et, or some such, or the hexanies and eikosanies, or various other tunings discussed here that just won&apos;t cut the ice at all with common practice music.</p><p>Or one might want to explore 31-et or 53-et or just intonation twelve tone scales and lattices and comma shifts if one is very into nicely tuned common practice music.</p><p>If one is into medieval music then that&apos;s Margo&apos;s line where you follow all sorts of tunings in a medieval style where the fifth is still important as a consonance but the third needn&apos;t be particularly. Then there are other possibliities as well, e.g. gamelan where it isn&apos;t so much really normal  conventional harmony that one is aiming for in a way.</p><p>17-et then is one that is sort of a bit familiar and can do 12-t type music not too badly, enough so that it seems familiar but not very good at it perhaps except that it may feel surprisingly lyrical. If one follows through, it may be that it brings out a different style altogether, coming to relish the somewhat discordant thirds no longer  as a consonance but as something else, another kind of element in the music. Then  George&apos;s paper suggests there may be other more  exotic ways of exploring it as well using other intervals instead of the fifth to structure ones music.</p><p>So given that background, one wouldn&apos;t really expect it to show up very well with transcriptions of common practice music. Well my little piece though isn&apos;t that either, as it is likely to be a bit unorthodox as it was written to a particular j.i. scale, just using the harmonic resources in that scale. So anyway all  you can really find out is whether my somewhat  unorthodox little piece in a particular ji.i. scale hybridises well with various ets apart from the ones it was originally written for.</p><p>So anyway, quite fun, and I&apos;m interested enough to hear how  it turns up. However, I don&apos;t think one can conclude much about the melodic virtues or otherwise e.g. of sharp fifths or small semitones in a more general way.</p><p>Sometime it woudl be nice to settle down and do some composing in 17-et for instance. Most of my pieces have been  very short first impression type pieces of various tunings, and that also is nice  to do, like ones first impressions of a place or person, quick sketch, could be interesting to look back on later, and it also often has a kind of freshness to it which is appealing. So I think it is a valid and nice thing to do to kind of dash off a little piece in a tuning that you haven&apos;t really explored that much. Just so long as it isn&apos;t taken as the outcome of long considered exploration and if one doesn&apos;t take it too seriously or try to generalise about what one found out in ones little test piece  :-).</p><p>So anyway, yes I think 17-et is a very lyrical tuning (amongst others) and some time it would be nice to really explore it and try and bring out what I feel seems to come across when improvising in it. But I don&apos;t think there is any shortcut to doing that and particularly with this tuning, retuning a piece written in another tuning gives a hybrid which can be interesting in its own right, but doesn&apos;t really tell one that much about 17-et as such, rather just about what happens when you hybridise it with this other particular tuning and also perhaps only really about what happens with a particualr piece, in short I&apos;m not sure one can generalise very much.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=67775 href="#67775">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2006 8:22:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I get the impression there are several strands to microtonal<br/>interest, and one starts with common practice music and one is<br/>looking for tunings to explore the same kinds of chords and<br/>progressions, but better tuned than in 12-et or else to bring out<br/>particular characteristics - or maybe  one has things like using<br/>septimal intervals, but still basically the same kind of harmonic<br/>ethos in a way.</p><p>I&apos;d say my approach starts from the 7-limit, which I take as basic,<br/>but taking the 5-limit as basic makes a lot of sense also. In fact,<br/>things like marvel tempering allow you to start from five and layer<br/>seven on top. That&apos;s not the same as starting from common practice,<br/>but if you can&apos;t produce a decent major triad I&apos;d hope at least you<br/>can do no-threes or no-fives triads.

Your<br/>version of Kirkwood Gaps would be an example of that, but often it<br/>seems to me the assumption is that any old collection of notes will<br/>do, and that&apos;s what I want to get away from.</p><p>&gt; So - for instance if one wanted  everything turned on its head one<br/>might be interested in 7-et maybe, or 11-et 13-et, or some such, or<br/>the hexanies and eikosanies, or various other tunings discussed here<br/>that just won&apos;t cut the ice at all with common practice music.</p><p>From my point of view these are very different things. Hexanies and<br/>eikosanies are JI, and 11 explores a system of subgroup-type harmony,<br/>in effect, I think. 7 strikes me as a boring alternative to the<br/>diatonic scale, and 13 is weird.</p><p>&gt; Or one might want to explore 31-et or 53-et or just intonation<br/>twelve tone scales and lattices and comma shifts if one is very into<br/>nicely tuned common practice music.</p><p>53 is a schismatic system and not suitable for common practice music.<br/>It would be great for medieval music, though.</p><p>&gt; If one is into medieval music then that&apos;s Margo&apos;s line where you<br/>follow all sorts of tunings in a medieval style where the fifth is<br/>still important as a consonance but the third needn&apos;t be<br/>particularly.

I observed that 34 is the only tuning that has both a<br/>good 5/4 and 5/3 and also has the Archytas comma tempered out in the<br/>upward jump of the fifth between 7/4 and 4/3 (at 0:27-0:28).  But I<br/>can&apos;t say that it&apos;s clearly my favorite for that reason, because I<br/>also liked 46 and 68 better than the others.</p><p>In the paper, I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that wide fifths<br/>are necessarily better melodically under all circumstances -- I was<br/>writing specifically about a diatonic scale, where wide fifths result<br/>in significantly narrower-than-12ET diatonic semitones.  Several<br/>times in the paper (pp. 59, 74, 75), I made statements to the effect<br/>that chromatic semitones in 31-ET could be used to enhance the<br/>melodic effect of that (narrow-fifth) tuning, so the size of the<br/>fifths is, under more general circumstances, beside the point.</p><p>If your tuning has dozens of tones/octave, you then have<br/>opportunities to alter the mood on the fly by making subtle<br/>substitutions in your scale subset, so it&apos;s not wise to draw<br/>conclusions too quickly about one of these tunings vs. another.</p><p>--George</p></div>
