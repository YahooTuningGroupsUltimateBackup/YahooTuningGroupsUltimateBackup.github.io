From what I&apos;ve read, Carl&apos;s inclusion on the program had difficult circumstances attached to it, and probably did not come off as either of you had hoped or intended.

One would hope, being in the position you have placed yourself as a concert organizer/promoter, that your ways can be more magnanimous in the future, but you have more than two decades worth of concerts, and how you run them is certainly your business.</p><p>Jon</p></div>
