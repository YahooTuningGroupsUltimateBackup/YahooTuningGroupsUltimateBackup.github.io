The members of this list have a diversity of interests and areas of expertise, not all of which overlap.  These interests may or may not overlap well with your own, and it may well be the case that there are no overlapping interests, but we&apos;ll never know unless you make it more clear, using the discipline of some common language, rather than sending out a steady stream of files and postings without paying attention to feedback or the absence of feedback.</p><p>It is often the case that musicians working with theoretical projects do so idiosyncratically, attempting to explain or explore matters from a blank slate.  Such idiosyncratic theory-making is particularly in evidence in tuning theory.  There is nothing wrong with this, and it can, indeed, be a very fertile and imaginative way of working, perhaps even the most natural way of working for independently-minded composers or theorists (I like the idea, for example, that every composer with a distinct style has her or his own implicit &quot;Harmonielehre&quot;), but going it alone runs the risk in practice that others will not be able to understand your work without effort, if at all.  For this reason, it is really to your advantage, when working with other musicians, to first try to understand their work, figure out their language, and then try to enter the conversation.  It has been a personal revelation to me, for example, to take a step back from my own tuning theory experiences (and, yes, prejudices) and listen to the conversation among stylistic algorithm theorists or Neo-Riemannians or the young geometrists or set theorists or even Schenkerians.  It turns out that we actually have a lot in common and that sometimes our strengths complement their deficits.  And yes, sometimes the opposite is the case.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=84420 href="#84420">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2009 4:53:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Mr. Pizarro,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not everybody has the time to study everything what&apos;s offered here.<br/>&gt; I personally am also not interested in your research.

He has obviously spent a long time working on his project, and he has made some claims for it, but the exact nature of those claims remains a mystery to me.  I am as wary of snake oil tuning theory as anyone (see my posting from 2001, here: <a href="/tuning/topicId_19882.html#19882">/tuning/topicId_19882.html#19882</a> ) but, AFAIC, any musician who is interested in tuning deserves the benefit of a doubt.

In this way, I hope, we can give him one more opportunity to address us, to do so in more familiar terms and then we should have the opportunity to offer him either a clear critique or direct him to more useful resources.

If you entered to the files section to read the abstract you can also see the harmony photos of the total 24 major and minor Piagui I triads in comparison with their corresponding triads of the equal tempered scale.

All the Piagui chord wave peaks  look aesthetic while the ones of the 12-eq. tempered are distorted.</p><p>You asked responses with just a YES or NO.

Your argument for your tuning would be much more coherent if placed in that context.  My honest suspicion is that your particular variation along these lines is not superior (in terms of either sum consonance or the particular distribution of consonance among tonalities) to a number of well-known historical temperaments.</p><p>I find it interesting that you do not make claims about sensory consonance of triads in your tunings, but you do argue for the visual &quot;aesthetic&quot; appearance of your graphics. I would argue (a) that the two are not unrelated (that is, with harmonic timbres, there will be a close correlation between sensory consonance and the complexity of the graphic representation), but (b) as we are concerned with music to be played on real instruments and heard by real ears, sooner or later the test of your tuning will have to be in terms of sensory consonance, thus any argument for your tuning without such a component will be incomplete and not particularly useful.  If, however, you want to make a case for evaluating tunings entirely on a visual aesthetic basis, then I believe you have substantial work to do in making that case.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
