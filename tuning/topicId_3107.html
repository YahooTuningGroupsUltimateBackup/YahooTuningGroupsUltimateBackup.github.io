I don&apos;t think a physics journal would<br/>publish a paper on perception of a beat note.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we have a flute at A440. And another at (perfect) E1320. The<br/>beat will be at A880, which does happen to be in the range. A beat can<br/>be either in or out of the range of the instruments creating it. In the<br/>range, it sounds corporeal. Outside the range, it sounds ethereal. I am<br/>stretching, but I think this is clear.</p><p>That beat would be hidden by the second harmonic of the lower flute.<br/>(Even though flutes tend not to have second harmonics, the ear can fill<br/>it in.) A more striking demonstration might be the A 440 and the perfect<br/>D 1010. The beat would be 570, anharmonic to A, within range, and might<br/>sound pretty out of place. I am guessing it&apos;s about a minor third.</p><p>Yours, Doug Goncz<br/>Replikon Research, PO Box 4094, Seven Corners, VA 22044-0094<br/><a href="http://users.aol.com/DGoncz">http://users.aol.com/DGoncz</a></p></div>
