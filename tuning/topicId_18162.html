Manuel had pointed<br/>out a thing in the Wilson archives that assigned pitches to the Penrose tiling nodes.<br/>However if one followed  a line of the tiling, as my tonescapes were going to do, the<br/>pitches would wander far.</p><p>So added idea of going up for L,and down for S, and if you choose correctly,it works.</p><p>Since you don&apos;t have Win 95/98, here is a midi clip to show the idea:<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5.mid</a><br/>(and if anyone wants the fts file:)<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5.ts">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5.ts</a></p><p>Instrument: Rhodes piano.<br/>Rule:<br/>L -&gt; L S S S<br/>S -&gt; L S L<br/>L/S = 1.22474487139159</p><p>For each L, goes down 4/5<br/>For each S, goes up 6/5.</p><p>These keep the pitch drift to within 0.012562 percent (amount of drift expected in the<br/>average time between successive short beats, as a percentage of the frequency of the<br/>note). I.e. you can go on for thousands of notes before the pitch drift gets really<br/>noticeable.</p><p>You keep coming back to the same notes, almost, but with a tiny drift in pitch each time.</p><p>But because there are many beats involved in the substitution, can wander pretty far for<br/>this one.</p><p>One could go up or down by a scale fragment for each L, or S, then it would be getting<br/>pretty close to your idea.</p><p>At least, if I understand it right. Do I have the general idea right??</p><p>I suppose you don&apos;t have the same pitch wander thing, because your improvisator keeps<br/>finding its way back to the top level of the l-system recursion....</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18165 href="#18165">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2001 9:16:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve done another version of same ts file, but much faster, to show how it goes on a<br/>longer time<br/>scale.</p><p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.mid</a><br/>(4 mins, 327 K)<br/>(and if anyone wants the fts file:)<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.ts">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.ts</a></p><p>(last one also was done with the tune set to rebound if it went out of a pre-defined<br/>range, so<br/>had occasional large leaps).</p><p>When played fast, the fibonacci tonescapes often sound rather like the kind of sounds you<br/>can get in the wind.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18207 href="#18207">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2001 3:17:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I&apos;ve done another version of same ts file, but much faster, to show how<br/>&gt;it goes on a<br/>&gt;longer time<br/>&gt;scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.mid</a></p><p>This is an awesome sound!I wasn&#xFFFD;t able to listen to it in entire right now but...i will try to figure out how to use this program soon.</p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/> MATS &#xFFFD;LJARE<br/> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare">http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare</a><br/>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>.</p></div><h3><a id=18248 href="#18248">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2001 8:29:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mats,</p><p>&gt;<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/fts_6o5_4o5_fast.mid</a></p><p>&gt; This is an awesome sound!I wasn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t able to listen to it in entire right now<br/>&gt; but...i will try to figure out how to use this program soon.</p><p>Glad you like it.</p><p>You can find the tone scapes under<br/>+...
