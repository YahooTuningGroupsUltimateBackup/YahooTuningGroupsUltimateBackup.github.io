As<br/>an example, assume you&apos;re playing in extended meantone: meantone[12]<br/>is always sort of there under the radar. This is probably somewhat<br/>because of acculturation, but not really, because it&apos;s pretty easy to<br/>discover meantone[12] even if you&apos;re just playing in meantone[7]; just<br/>interpolate melodically between diatonic notes, or modulate to the<br/>parallel minor, and you&apos;re bound to discover meantone[12]&apos;s existence<br/>soon enough.</p><p>Here&apos;s a sample situation which comes up all the time when you use<br/>unequal chromatic scales. Say you&apos;re in 19-EDO, and you want to play C<br/>minor - note that Eb is in this pitch set. Then, say you modulate<br/>around for a while, ultimately ending up at C lydian #2, specifically<br/>the C-E-F#-B-D# voicing, which is a beautiful chord everyone should<br/>play a lot. Note that D# is in this pitch set.</p><p>Now you need Eb and D#! What do you do? What are your options?<br/>1) Don&apos;t play that chord progression. (Too limiting.)<br/>2) Limit yourself to a 12-note subset of meantone, pick one of those<br/>choices, and use just use the enharmonic equivalent in the other case.<br/>(Intonationally uneven.)<br/>3) Pick a larger MOS of meantone, like meantone[19], and use that MOS<br/>instead of meantone[12]. (On the right track.)</p><p>While #3 is clearly the best, practical constraints permitting, I<br/>suggest that this solution is even better</p><p>4) Pick a larger MOS of meantone, like meantone[19]. Continue to use<br/>meantone[12] as a prominent subset within this larger MOS, and just<br/>change the mode of meantone[12] you&apos;re using on the fly when stuff<br/>like this happens.</p><p>In other words, I&apos;m saying, use a larger MOS as your gamut, but then<br/>don&apos;t forget about meantone[12]. If this seems trivial, then try<br/>replacing meantone[12] with orwell[13] or porcupine[15] above or the<br/>14-note Fokker block of your choice, and maybe it&apos;ll make some<br/>xenharmonic sense too.</p><p>A good analogy for the effect I&apos;ve found this to create is the concept<br/>of playing a fast line of parallel thirds in the major scale. Despite<br/>the changing specific intervals, it&apos;s audible that they&apos;re both<br/>&quot;thirds&quot; and share the same generic interval class. To do the above<br/>with a set of parallel chromatic scale modes in a larger enharmonic<br/>scale likewise helps to create a strong sense of generic interval<br/>class for the generic intervals in the chromatic scale, and hence a<br/>clear sense of chromatic &quot;scale degrees&quot; on which simpler melodies can<br/>be built.</p><p>It would be really nice to do this for chromatic scales containing a<br/>number of notes not equal to 12. For instance, the 22-EDO pitch set<br/>suddenly pops into a more well-defined existence when you view it as<br/>an enharmonic scale containing a prominent 15-tone chromatic scale<br/>system. I also note that EDOs of around 17 and higher contain more<br/>than one potential chromatic scale in this way - for instance, 19-EDO<br/>has not only meantone[12] but sensi[11], wholetone[13], semaphore[14],<br/>hanson[15], magic[16], etc. And 22-EDO contains not only porcupine[15]<br/>but pajara[12], orwell[13], hedgehog[14], astrology[16],<br/>superpyth[17], etc.</p><p>I think that this approach can serve useful for higher-rank systems as<br/>well - there&apos;s no reason why you couldn&apos;t pick a Fokker block as a<br/>chromatic scale and then shift around the different domes and modes of<br/>it when necessary, still keeping the sense that there exists some<br/>constant set of chromatic generic intervals in the background. I also<br/>strongly suspect that the creation of such generic chromatic intervals<br/>will strongly aid the development of what I was previously calling<br/>&quot;interval categories&quot; for a tuning system, but which I now believe are<br/>much more complex and possibly related to lifelong memories of nearly<br/>subconscious musical features such as this. I&apos;ll try to come up with<br/>some musical examples sometime soon when I&apos;m not drowning in work.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104593 href="#104593">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2012 5:58:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,</p><p>Here&apos;s my attempt, back in 1995, of &quot;An algorithm for dynamically choosing the best 12 notes from an extended meantone&quot;.<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/AdaptiveMeantone.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/AdaptiveMeantone.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=104606 href="#104606">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2012 4:00:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dave - very neat idea! I suppose I was thinking of doing something<br/>like this, but manually, as a performer, in realtime. For instance,<br/>you say this:</p><p>&quot;Truly chromatic music is just not going to work. For example<br/>attempting to play a chromatic scale up from C will result in the<br/>sequence C,C#,D,D#,E,E#,F#,F##,G#,G##,Bb,B,C.&quot;</p><p>This solves that problem, because then the performer will have a good<br/>sense of which notes go where.</p><p>My compositional idea with this is that a chromatic scale gives you a<br/>strong sense of there being a background set of pitches, or more like<br/>&quot;generic pitches&quot; of which &quot;specific pitches&quot; exist. Put another way,<br/>there&apos;s a strong sense of background chromatic &quot;generic interval<br/>classes&quot; in which specific &quot;enharmonic variants&quot; or &quot;commatic<br/>variants&quot; can exist or whatever.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why this couldn&apos;t work with Fokker blocks too. For<br/>instance, on one extreme, there&apos;s the idea of JI giving you all these<br/>notes so you might as well play totally freeform and not worry about<br/>scales too much. On the other extreme, there are people who stick<br/>specifically to x-note subsets of JI and don&apos;t modulate past those.</p><p>This is what I feel to be the optimal compromise between the two. You<br/>imply a &quot;generic chromatic scale&quot; and work with different modes and<br/>domes of it as the music you&apos;re writing dictates, keeping some kind of<br/>constant ground all the while.</p><p>You get bonus points if your generic chromatic scale is -not- 12<br/>notes. 15 note generic chromatic scales in 11-limit JI plz.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Fri, May 18, 2012 at 8:58 PM, dkeenanuqnetau &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s my attempt, back in 1995, of &quot;An algorithm for dynamically choosing the best 12 notes from an extended meantone&quot;.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/AdaptiveMeantone.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/AdaptiveMeantone.htm</a></p></div>
