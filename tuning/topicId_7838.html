I recently saw that most all the Brothers<br/>Quay animated shorts (including &quot;IGOR - THE PARIS YEARS CHEZ PLEYEL&quot;)<br/>are now available on video... and although I have seen &quot;STREET OF<br/>CROCODILES&quot; -- my personal Quay (and Jankowski) fave -- on video, I<br/>thought it lost an awful lot of detail and impact compared to when I<br/>saw it on the big screen, but no doubt video will be the only<br/>opportunity most will have to check most of these out at all, and it&apos;s<br/>hard to argue with that, as they&apos;re really quite a remarkable treat<br/>(IMO).</p><p>Siskel &amp; Dbert</p></div>
