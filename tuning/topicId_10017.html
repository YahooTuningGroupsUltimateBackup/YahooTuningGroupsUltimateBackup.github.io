The range is<br/>determined by the diameter of the bore, so if you lengthen the instrument<br/>and keep the bore the same, you&apos;ll get higher harmonics.  But if you&apos;re<br/>using regular holes, the higher the harmonic the less in tune (more flat)<br/>it will be unless the holes are the same width as the bore (which is big).</p><p>jason</p><p>&gt;Yes, but I can only get harmonics 1 through 3 on the recorder without<br/>&gt;sounding shrill and squeaky. If you lengthened the pipe it would obviously<br/>&gt;lower the fundamental, but would the range stay the same, giving more and<br/>&gt;higher harmonics, or would the harmonics stay the same, giving simply a<br/>&gt;lower pitch? In other words, if I made the pipe four times as long (making<br/>&gt;it three feet!), to lower the fundamental from c&quot; to c, would the range<br/>&gt;change to c-g&apos; or would it stay c&quot;-g&apos;&apos;&apos;, adding harmonics at e&quot;, bb&quot;,d&apos;&apos;&apos;,<br/>&gt;and f+&apos;&apos;&apos;? Or something in between?...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Stay Tuned,<br/>&gt;    Keenan P<br/>&gt;</p></div>
