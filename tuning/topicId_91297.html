I need an education here.  I&apos;ve hit a snag in writing my &quot;primer&quot; on alternative EDOs, in the section where I describe the harmonic properties of each EDO.  I&apos;d been using the &quot;standard&quot; approach of describing intervals as approximations to JI, but I&apos;ve realized that I don&apos;t quite understand if that&apos;s valid to do for some intervals...or rather, if it&apos;s valid to use just one JI interval as a descriptor, and if so, how to determine which one.</p><p>I&apos;m going crazy because I don&apos;t know if odd-limit or prime-limit is a better indicator of how an interval can be &quot;perceived&quot;, and also I don&apos;t know how much error is acceptable.  Really, I guess what I want to know is 1) how do you really judge the &quot;complexity&quot; of a JI ratio, and 2) if an interval is close to a high-complexity ratio but still within 10 to 16 cents of a low-complexity ratio, which one is the better descriptor for that interval?</p><p>The best example I&apos;ve got is the 466.667-cent diminished fourth in 18-EDO.  It&apos;s close to both 21/16 and 17/13 (in fact, those two intervals are only about 6 cents apart); 21/16 is lower in prime-limit but higher in odd-limit.  The tempered interval is about 2 cents closer to 17/13, but 21/16 would be more useful for describing how the interval works in the temperament, since 18-EDO has a very good 9/8 and 7/6 and thus can make a slightly-tempered 16:18:21 triad.  Of course, that same triad could also be described as a heavily-tempered 13:15:17 triad, which is higher in prime-limit but closer to the fundamental in the harmonic series.</p><p>Another example I have is the 218.182-cent major second common in EDOs divisible by 11.  It&apos;s midway between 8/7 and 9/8, so it&apos;s right on top of 17/15.  17/15 seems to be a very complex interval, and this tempered interval is certainly not within 6 or 7 cents of the near-by simple ratios; yet it&apos;s ever-so-slightly closer to 8/7 than 9/8, and in 22-EDO it functions as BOTH a 9/8 and 8/7, depending on the chord.  I could see good reasons for describing it as all three ratios, but I&apos;ve no idea how to narrow it down to one.</p><p>Lastly, I&apos;m plagued by trying to figure out 12-tET.  In theory, it&apos;s supposed to approximate 5-limit ratios, but its thirds are SOOOO close to both 3-prime-limit and 19-odd-limit intervals, it&apos;s got me wondering what we&apos;re really hearing when we hear 12-tET.</p><p>Tell me, folks, is there a way to find the most perceptually-valid JI-related description of tempered intervals like these, or should I just give the two or three possible ratios and not worry about the absolute cents-value deviation?  Do I need to understand harmonic entropy to figure this out?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91302 href="#91302">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2010 1:42:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, folks.

One thing I hate about that<br/>though...the product must be less than 70 for it to worl...that should mean 9/8<br/>is out as 9*8 = 72...not to mention just about anything 11-limit (even 11/7 is<br/>too high).</p><p>&gt;&quot;JI dyads beyond the 9-limit are generally not perceivable as JI dyads.&quot;<br/>Ok...I can believe it&apos;s an established rule, but don&apos;t agree with it.  So even<br/>something like 11/6 or 18/11 or 10/9 is not perceivable as a<br/>dyad?!.....ouch!...that&apos;s a bit anal-retentive IMVHO.  To me (by ear) anything<br/>up to say with a product of up to about 200 (or within 7 cents of such a ratio)<br/>should be OK.</p><p>&gt;&quot;For triads, the product rule can also be used, but with cuberoot in place<br/>of square root.&quot;<br/>  Interesting and makes sense...if you have two good dyads in a triad you have<br/>more slack for the third dyad to be &quot;less JI&quot;.  So many songs by Igs and other<br/>seems to point toward this as well.</p><p>Igs&gt; &quot;The best example I&apos;ve got is the 466.667-cent diminished<br/>fourth in 18-EDO.

They work only in triads and larger chords.&quot;<br/>   Hmm...21/16 and 17/13  1.3125 and 1.30769.  Yeah that&apos;s within about 7 cents<br/>of each other...thus I&apos;d each could substitute in for the other.  For the sake<br/>of speaking &quot;in JI&quot;, though, I&apos;d say 17/13 is the more obvious of the two to<br/>round to.  Certainly I&apos;d say neither are close enough to 13/10 or 4/3 to round<br/>to those...</p><p>   Far as Even 1.681 from 12TET is closest to 27/16 and nowhere near 5/3 (not<br/>even with 13 cents of it).<br/>  Far as &quot;Such intervals are not tunable by ear&quot;...wow what a pessimistic<br/>assumption.  The 6th in 12TET in about 1.681, over 13 cents away from 5/3 and<br/>has it&apos;s only ratio within 7 cents as being 27/16 (product of 432!) and yet<br/>people tune it by ear all the time.  Not to say 432 is a good product, but I<br/>don&apos;t buy for a second that having a high product alone means not tunable by<br/>ear.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It says that anything between 448 and 554 cents will tend to<br/>sound like a 4/3, when heard in isolation.&quot;<br/>  I can believe that, to an extent.  4/3 does have an uncommonly large area<br/>between the 15/11 above it and 9/7 below it (the two nearest intervals near it I<br/>believe sound substantially different)...but an entire semitone difference?!<br/>Looks to me like whoever wrote that must have been smoking a bit too much<br/>12TET...</p><p>&gt;&quot;It is one cent closer to 4/3, but because, as Partch discovered, the size of<br/>an interval&apos;s field of attraction is proportional to its<br/>complexity&quot;<br/>  Makes sense in many cases.  Definitely with 3/2, 4/3, and 5/3.  Now for 7/4<br/>and above, I&apos;m not so sure: 16/9 (which is very nearby) sounds very much like<br/>it&apos;s own in my book and not a &quot;weaker 7/4&quot; by any means.  So I&apos;d say...in<br/>general but not always.</p><p>Carl&gt;&quot;Why does it (9/8 vs. 8/7) have to be narrowed down to one?<br/>   Oddly, that statement seems to go against the grain of much of what you said<br/>before.  For one thing, 9/8 is over 70 as a product (as 72).  Though I<br/>agree...they are both individual ratios and far enough away from each other to<br/>stand out (certainly, at well over 15 cents apart they are unlikely to be stuck<br/>in each other&apos;s &quot;field of attraction&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=91313 href="#91313">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2010 12:20:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,<br/>Sorry, I&apos;ve tried to reply to this twice today but it doesn&apos;t seem to be going through.

Harmonic entropy isn&apos;t a measure of the stability of an interval (i.e. how periodic it is/how well the partials line up with the harmonic series) but rather how strongly the brain can identify it.  Yes, it is theoretically possible to tune 10/9 and 9/8 by ear, since they&apos;re both stable/beatless, but you&apos;d be hard-pressed to be able to identify which one you&apos;d tuned to!  Same thing with 11/8 and 18/13 and 15/11.  What really fascinates me is how uneven the graph of harmonic entropy is, suggesting that stable ratios are not evenly spread out across the pitch-spectrum but instead cluster in certain areas.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s the limit for triads, then?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sqrt(70) is about 8.  So maybe the limit for triads is about 500,<br/>&gt; since cubert(500) is about 8?  Really, I have no idea, and I<br/>&gt; doubt anyone else does either.  It would take experiments.</p><p>I&apos;m frankly amazed that so many people have drawn conclusions about harmony without conducting experiments on triads.</p><p>&gt; Certainly, a laser-like focus on dyads will not give a good<br/>&gt; picture of how an EDO will work musically.  Lots of people have<br/>&gt; written about EDOs from a dyads perspective, fewer from the<br/>&gt; perspective of larger chords, so it may be a more fertile area.<br/>&gt; (Paul was among the first to point out a basic flaw in most<br/>&gt; people&apos;s dyadic approach -- the best dyads they were measuring<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t always fit together into larger chords.  The solution<br/>&gt; was to test an EDO for something called consistency, and throw<br/>&gt; out EDOs that didn&apos;t pass.  Gene later pointed out that every<br/>&gt; EDO tuning can in fact represent several rank 1 temperaments,<br/>&gt; all of which are consistent a.k.a. regular by definition, and<br/>&gt; we can just compare them to find something satisfactory instead<br/>&gt; of throwing any EDOs out...)</p><p>Yeah, I think this is the way I need to go.  Of course, I&apos;m not always very good about figuring out the harmonic series representation of certain triads.  But I&apos;ll get better, I&apos;m sure.  I remember Cameron Bobro pointed out to me one day that 23-EDO could be represented very well almost entirely with 21-odd-limit ratios.  Perhaps other EDOs will prove similar.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why does it have to be narrowed down to one?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it doesn&apos;t, I just assumed it would.  But from what I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; &gt; learning about harmonic entropy, it seems like for a lot of<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals found in various EDOs, there are multiple valid<br/>&gt; &gt; JI ratios that can be used as descriptors.  In fact, it looks<br/>&gt; &gt; like there are only a few intervals that represent significant<br/>&gt; &gt; minima of harmonic entropy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it&apos;s very depressing to numerologists.  But nobody&apos;s ever<br/>&gt; been able to tune ratios like 17/13 by ear in an experimental<br/>&gt; setting.  Most or all of the harmonic entropy minima have been<br/>&gt; tuned by ear in experiments.  However, the ratios of 17 are still<br/>&gt; significant in chords!  And tetradic harmonic entropy would<br/>&gt; surely show minima for chords like 10:12:15:17.</p><p>I guess my biggest question about these higher-limit ratios is, if you played them on an electric guitar with heavy distortion/fuzz, would they fall apart the way 12-tET&apos;s thirds do?  I suppose the best measure for that is periodicity.  Is there a standard way to calculate periodicity?  Is it just the product of the numerator and denominator?  I know that to find the common meter for a polyrhythm, you multiply the numerators of the meters of both rhythms (so 5/4 over 3/4 fits into 1 bar of 15/4), so I&apos;d suspect frequency ratios would be the same way.  I&apos;d be really excited if I could figure out the highest-limit ratios that can survive a slight tempering and still sound &quot;stable&quot; with the timbre of a distorted electric guitar.  I know 13-odd-limit ratios work well enough, and my guess is that the limit is something like 15/11.</p><p>Thanks for helping me with this.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91336 href="#91336">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2010 9:46:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;I never said that.

Gene said that 7 cents is about the limit for a tempered interval to sound &quot;close enough&quot; to a Just interval.  Of course, he also stipulated that this really depends on the ratio and the musical context, and is not a universal constant.  On the other hand, that &quot;27 cents&quot; value has more to do with two somewhat-simple ratios that are close together, like 10/9 and 9/8.  While both are stable enough to be tuned by ear, they are not &quot;unique enough&quot; from each other to be easily told apart.  If you look at that graph of harmonic entropy that Carl posted, you&apos;ll see that it&apos;s very uneven across the pitch spectrum--what this means is that some areas of the pitch spectrum are denser with intervals of similar complexity, while others are not.  In the range of a major second, you have 10/9, 9/8, 11/10, 8/7, and such...yes, they are all of different complexity, but the range is small compared to the range of a perfect fifth.  There, you have 3/2, 22/15, 32/21, 50/33, 40/27, etc.  You can clearly see that 3/2 is of a drastically lower complexity than anything near-by, so there is lower harmonic entropy at that point.</p><p>So basically, the point of harmonic entropy is that if you have two ratios of similar complexity, and they&apos;re within about 27 cents of each other, it will be hard to tell which ratio you&apos;re hearing (assuming you hear the dyad in isolation; I&apos;m sure if you alternated between 10/9 and 9/8, you could tell the difference).  In other words, for some interval classes, it is much harder to define which ratio defines the interval class, because there are too many ratios of similar complexity close together in that one range to just &quot;pick one&quot;.</p><p>You should really study this!  I think this theory explains a lot of things very well.  Like Mike B.&apos;s and my observation that the size of the third in a minor triad seems to be able to vary quite a bit without losing the &quot;feel&quot; of a minor triad...the minor third range on the harmonic entropy graph is a pretty flat area!  So it stands to reason any interval on that range will work as well as any other.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91337 href="#91337">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2010 10:17:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 26 July 2010 17:31, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I guess my biggest question about these<br/>&gt; higher-limit ratios is, if you played them on<br/>&gt; an electric guitar with heavy distortion/fuzz,<br/>&gt; would they fall apart the way 12-tET&apos;s thirds do?<br/>&gt; &nbsp;I suppose the best measure for that is periodicity.<br/>&gt; &nbsp;Is there a standard way to calculate periodicity?<br/>&gt; &nbsp;Is it just the product of the numerator and<br/>&gt; denominator? &nbsp;I know that to find the common<br/>&gt; meter for a polyrhythm, you multiply the<br/>&gt; numerators of the meters of both rhythms<br/>&gt; (so 5/4 over 3/4 fits into 1 bar of 15/4), so<br/>&gt; I&apos;d suspect frequency ratios would be the same way.<br/>&gt; &nbsp;I&apos;d be really excited if I could figure out the highest-<br/>&gt; limit ratios that can survive a slight tempering and<br/>&gt; still sound &quot;stable&quot; with the timbre of a distorted<br/>&gt;  electric guitar. &nbsp;I know 13-odd-limit ratios work<br/>&gt; well enough, and my guess is that the limit is<br/>&gt; something like 15/11.</p><p>The period&apos;s the virtual 1/1.

There is somewhat of a paradox here, I believe.  Check it: some interval classes have a small difference between local minima and maxima, so you can say they are &quot;vaguely defined&quot; and thus not sensitive to &quot;mistuning&quot;.  Having a &quot;weak identity&quot;, in other words, implies that it&apos;s hard to make that interval sound very &quot;out-of-tune&quot;.  On the other hand, intervals with a large difference between their local minima and maxima have a strong identity, and so getting too far away from the minima leads to a &quot;mistuned&quot; sound.  However, because the identity is so strong, the &quot;musical meaning&quot; will be maintained, even under mistuning.  And of course, the mistuning may only be evident when played as dyads.  I&apos;ve found time and time again that a wolf dyad can become a consonant triad if the right note(s) is (are) put in the middle.</p><p>What harmonic entropy suggests to me is really a model of the character of various interval classes.  Some interval classes get their character from having a simple ratio at their center, while others get their character from having a sort of &quot;ambiguity&quot; to them.  Maybe the musical meaning of an interval has less to do with ratios and more to do with, oh, I dunno, maybe something like the derivative of the curve of harmonic entropy?  (Sorry if that doesn&apos;t make sense, my recollection of calculus is a bit dim).  What I mean is, maybe the &quot;feel&quot; of an interval comes from the relationship of the harmonic entropy of that interval to the harmonic entropy of its neighbors, i.e. the &quot;rate of change&quot; of harmonic entropy at that interval--that&apos;s a derivative, right?</p><p>I dunno, maybe I have the whole concept upside-down and backwards.

However, I<br/>do find complex as well simple ratios as friendly and welcoming<br/>landmarks when exploring a familiar region of the spectrum, or<br/>possibly a new one.</p><p>For example, suppose I were writing a brief description of 29-EDO.<br/>Here are some possible ideas:</p><p>              *                *               *</p><p>In describing or exploring 29-EDO, we can make the fertile territory<br/>of this temperament a bit more orderly by looking at three main<br/>&quot;interval families&quot; available.</p><p>The first of these families consists of regular diatonic intervals<br/>built with chains of from one to six of the near-pure 29-EDO fifths<br/>(17/29 octave or about 703.45 cents). Since the fifths are less<br/>than 1.5 cents wide of a pure 3:2 (701.96 cents), these regular<br/>intervals are quite close to those of Pythagorean tuning using<br/>these just fifths -- a feature very conducive to some styles,<br/>and not so conducive to others.</p><p>These wide 29-EDO fifths -- extended fifths, as they are sometimes<br/>called -- result in a kind of accentuated Pythagorean-like tuning<br/>which can be beautifully apt for the classic 13th-14th century<br/>styles of Europe, but quite unlikely the meantone or well-tempered<br/>systems that developed in the 15th-19th centuries. Major thirds<br/>at around 414 cents (slightly wide of 33:26), and minor thirds at<br/>290 cents (just a tad wide of 13:11), very nicely fit a medieval<br/>style where these complex intervals, like the Pythagorean 81:64<br/>and 32:27 at 408 and 294 cents, typically resolve to stable<br/>intervals such as fifths and fourths. For those who relish<br/>these styles, the near-pure fourths and fifths of 29-EDO contrast<br/>nicely with the more complex thirds and sixths.</p><p>A big asset of 29-EDO for these polyphonic progressions as well<br/>as pure melody is the regular diatonic semitone or limma<br/>(2/29 octave) at 83 cents, or somewhere between 22:21 (81 cents)<br/>and 21:20 (84 cents).</p><p>From these regular intervals we move to the next family, augmented<br/>or diminished intervals formed from chains of 7-11 fifths.</p><p>Again, people looking for subtly complex thirds and sixths will<br/>be happy, while those seeking out the simplest ratios (e.g. 5:4,<br/>6:5, 7:6) may be disappointed. A diminished fourth (e.g. C#-F)<br/>from 8 fifths down or fourths up is 372 cents, a bit wide of<br/>the large neutral or submajor third at 26:21, while an augmented<br/>second from 9 fourths up at 331 cents (e.g. F-G#) is just narrow<br/>of of a small neutral or supraminor third at 63:52 (332 cents).</p><p>Along with these thirds, this family also includes a chromatic<br/>semitone from 7 fifths up (e.g. C-C#), also known as an apotome,<br/>at 124 cents, a step a bit narrow of 14:13 (128 cents). A<br/>diminished third at 166 cents from ten fifths down (e.g. C#-Eb),<br/>precisely twice the size of the usual 83-cent semitone, yields<br/>a virtually just 11:10.</p><p>For this family of intervals, at least two stylistic approaches<br/>are possible. One approach, for people looking for a harmonic<br/>approximation of 12-EDO or meantone, is to treat a 372-cent<br/>or 331-cent third as an inaccurate approximation of 5:4 (386<br/>cents) or 6:5 (316 cents). In such a context, both the<br/>notable impurity or complexity of the thirds and the wide<br/>nature of the 124-cent apotome which here serves in effect<br/>as a diatonic semitone, can create what is sometimes described<br/>as a languid or melancholy quality -- different, but not<br/>neessarily unpleasant.</p><p>However, one may alternatively look on these steps and<br/>intervals as neutral, or at least semi-neutral, possibly<br/>representing, for example, 26:21, 63:52, and 14:13. In<br/>some Persian and Turkish contexts, and possibly in<br/>certain Kurdish ones also, steps of 124 and 165 cents<br/>may nicely fit the needs of the music -- and likewise<br/>the semi-neutral thirds, in polyphonic styles.</p><p>For example, here is a basic tuning for a Turkish<br/>interpretation of Makam Huseyni, using a conventional<br/>note spelling to reflect the chains of fifths:</p><p>  |-------------|    |-------------|<br/>  0    4   7   12   17   21   24  29<br/>  C#   Eb  E   F#   G#   Bb   B   C#<br/>  0   166 290  497 703  869  993 1200</p><p>Makam Huseyni in its basic &quot;textbook&quot; form consists<br/>of two tetrachords, with a tone between them, each<br/>having a large neutral second (ideally around 11:10),<br/>a small neutral second, and an upper tone. It&apos;s<br/>interesting that a small step of 124 cents, found<br/>here at Eb-E and Bb-B, may occur in certain Persian<br/>modes.</p><p>The third interval family of 29-EDO consists of rather<br/>complex intervals favored by many of the world&apos;s musical<br/>traditions, here termed _interseptimal_ intervals because<br/>they occur in the middle region between two septimal<br/>ratios such as the large 8:7 tone (231 cents) and the<br/>small 7:6 minor third (267 cents). In 29-EDO, we get<br/>an intriguing size from 14 fifths up of 248 cents --<br/>sometimes called a hemifourth, because it&apos;s equal<br/>more or less (here precisely) to half of a fourth.</p><p>Hemifourths might suggest a simple septimal ratio<br/>like 8:7 or 7:6 -- and can delightfully be used<br/>contrapuntally in some styles as either a very<br/>wide tone or a very narrow minor third -- but are<br/>really a breed unto themselves. As it happens,<br/>the 29-EDO interval of 248 cents is a virtually<br/>just 15:13, while we also find intervals of<br/>455 cents (near 13:10), 745 cents (near 20:13),<br/>and 952 cents (near 26:15).</p><p>These intervals are used in world musics such as<br/>Balinese or Javanese gamelan, and additionally may<br/>be introduced into other types of contexts where<br/>they provide distinctly &quot;xenharmonic&quot; material.</p><p>Interseptimal intervals are closely related to<br/>another member of this third family: the diesis<br/>of 1/29 octave, or 41 cents, by which 12 fifths<br/>exceed 7 octaves. This family thus begins with<br/>a chain of 12 fifths producing the diesis itself,<br/>and continues as various regular intervals are<br/>altered by this diesis. Thus a regular 414-cent<br/>major third plus the diesis, or 497-cent fourth<br/>minus it, produces a 455-cent interval almost<br/>exactly at 13:10, somewhere between a usual<br/>septimal major third at 9:7 (435 cents) and<br/>a 4:3 fourth. The diesis might, for example,<br/>be interpreted in JI terms as a 40:39 (44 cents),<br/>the difference between 13:10 and 4:3.</p><p>For the adventurous, the 41-cent diesis may<br/>sometimes serve as an ultranarrow equivalent<br/>of a semitone, as may the larger 50-cent step<br/>in 24-EDO, for example. However, the diesis<br/>plays a vital role in the structure of the<br/>tuning for styles where it is unlikely to<br/>occur as a direct melodic step: for example,<br/>gamelan modes using the 248 cent hemifourths<br/>and other interseptimal intervals.</p><p>In short, 29-EDO is a versatile system supporting<br/>an &quot;accentuated Pythagorean&quot; rendition of 13th-14th<br/>century European music; a family of &quot;semi-neutral&quot;<br/>intervals very useful for some Near Eastern styles,<br/>and sometimes applied to get a &quot;different&quot; sound<br/>for European music that might normally be played<br/>in a system like meantone, a well-temperament,<br/>or 12-EDO; and interseptimal intervals fitting<br/>various musical styles including gamelan as well<br/>as adventurous xenharmonicism.</p><p>          *             *           *</p><p>This is just a sample about how I might approach<br/>an EDO system -- or a regular or irregular temperament<br/>of some other variety, for that matter. In 31-EDO,<br/>for example, we would have regular meantone, septimal,<br/>and neutral families. Knowing where these intervals<br/>fall on the spectrum, with rational ratios providing<br/>one set of useful landmarks, is only part of the<br/>question; what styles the reader of such a description<br/>is interested in, or might become interested in, is<br/>another.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=91352 href="#91352">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2010 6:35:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;Well, as Carl pointed out, this curve only holds for dyads.

I don&apos;t hear it as &quot;ambiguity&quot; or<br/>&quot;incompleteness&quot;...to me it&apos;s like putting strawberries on your chocolate<br/>ice-cream (for the &quot;weird intervals&quot; instead of chocolate chips (the more<br/>&quot;normal&quot; choice b/c the flavor of the &quot;topping&quot; is the same).

Or why the tonal &quot;color&quot; on those two is so much different despite<br/>their admittedly sounding a lot more like fifth than any other nearby interval<br/>class (IE than the 4th or 6th).  There seems to be a missing layer of<br/>granularity here that keeps the curve from being truly continuous...I just<br/>wonder what accounts for it.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What harmonic entropy suggests to me is really a model of the character of<br/>&gt;various interval classes.  &quot;<br/>   Exactly...though it doesn&apos;t seem to acknowledge much of the &quot;subtle-ties&quot;<br/>within those classes (which often pop up as very flat on the graph or,<br/>especially in the case of 4ths, 5ths, and 6ths, often not at all).</p><p>&gt;&quot;What I mean is, maybe the &quot;feel&quot; of an interval comes from the relationship of<br/>&gt;the harmonic entropy of that interval to the harmonic entropy of its neighbors,<br/>&gt;i.e. the &quot;rate of change&quot; of harmonic entropy at that interval--that&apos;s a<br/>&gt;derivative, right?&quot;<br/>  People make calculus seem way too complex :-D: yes, derivative = slope = rate<br/>of change.  Problem is rate of change would be VERY high around things like<br/>&quot;impure&quot; fifths, again seeming to allude to that, beyond a certain rather<br/>conservative point, 5ths like 22/15 or 13/9 or like comparing chocolate<br/>ice-cream to vanilla wafers instead of chocolate ice-cream and chocolate chips<br/>to chocolate ice-cream and strawberries.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I dunno, maybe I have the whole concept upside-down and backwards.

However, I<br/>&gt; do find complex as well simple ratios as friendly and welcoming<br/>&gt; landmarks when exploring a familiar region of the spectrum, or<br/>&gt; possibly a new one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, suppose I were writing a brief description of 29-EDO.<br/>&gt; Here are some possible ideas:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * * *<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In describing or exploring 29-EDO, we can make the fertile territory<br/>&gt; of this temperament a bit more orderly by looking at three main<br/>&gt; &quot;interval families&quot; available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first of these families consists of regular diatonic intervals<br/>&gt; built with chains of from one to six of the near-pure 29-EDO fifths<br/>&gt; (17/29 octave or about 703.45 cents). Since the fifths are less<br/>&gt; than 1.5 cents wide of a pure 3:2 (701.96 cents), these regular<br/>&gt; intervals are quite close to those of Pythagorean tuning using<br/>&gt; these just fifths -- a feature very conducive to some styles,<br/>&gt; and not so conducive to others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These wide 29-EDO fifths -- extended fifths, as they are sometimes<br/>&gt; called -- result in a kind of accentuated Pythagorean-like tuning<br/>&gt; which can be beautifully apt for the classic 13th-14th century<br/>&gt; styles of Europe, but quite unlikely the meantone or well-tempered<br/>&gt; systems that developed in the 15th-19th centuries. Major thirds<br/>&gt; at around 414 cents (slightly wide of 33:26), and minor thirds at<br/>&gt; 290 cents (just a tad wide of 13:11), very nicely fit a medieval<br/>&gt; style where these complex intervals, like the Pythagorean 81:64<br/>&gt; and 32:27 at 408 and 294 cents, typically resolve to stable<br/>&gt; intervals such as fifths and fourths. For those who relish<br/>&gt; these styles, the near-pure fourths and fifths of 29-EDO contrast<br/>&gt; nicely with the more complex thirds and sixths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A big asset of 29-EDO for these polyphonic progressions as well<br/>&gt; as pure melody is the regular diatonic semitone or limma<br/>&gt; (2/29 octave) at 83 cents, or somewhere between 22:21 (81 cents)<br/>&gt; and 21:20 (84 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From these regular intervals we move to the next family, augmented<br/>&gt; or diminished intervals formed from chains of 7-11 fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, people looking for subtly complex thirds and sixths will<br/>&gt; be happy, while those seeking out the simplest ratios (e.g. 5:4,<br/>&gt; 6:5, 7:6) may be disappointed. A diminished fourth (e.g. C#-F)<br/>&gt; from 8 fifths down or fourths up is 372 cents, a bit wide of<br/>&gt; the large neutral or submajor third at 26:21, while an augmented<br/>&gt; second from 9 fourths up at 331 cents (e.g. F-G#) is just narrow<br/>&gt; of of a small neutral or supraminor third at 63:52 (332 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Along with these thirds, this family also includes a chromatic<br/>&gt; semitone from 7 fifths up (e.g. C-C#), also known as an apotome,<br/>&gt; at 124 cents, a step a bit narrow of 14:13 (128 cents). A<br/>&gt; diminished third at 166 cents from ten fifths down (e.g. C#-Eb),<br/>&gt; precisely twice the size of the usual 83-cent semitone, yields<br/>&gt; a virtually just 11:10.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For this family of intervals, at least two stylistic approaches<br/>&gt; are possible. One approach, for people looking for a harmonic<br/>&gt; approximation of 12-EDO or meantone, is to treat a 372-cent<br/>&gt; or 331-cent third as an inaccurate approximation of 5:4 (386<br/>&gt; cents) or 6:5 (316 cents). In such a context, both the<br/>&gt; notable impurity or complexity of the thirds and the wide<br/>&gt; nature of the 124-cent apotome which here serves in effect<br/>&gt; as a diatonic semitone, can create what is sometimes described<br/>&gt; as a languid or melancholy quality -- different, but not<br/>&gt; neessarily unpleasant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, one may alternatively look on these steps and<br/>&gt; intervals as neutral, or at least semi-neutral, possibly<br/>&gt; representing, for example, 26:21, 63:52, and 14:13. In<br/>&gt; some Persian and Turkish contexts, and possibly in<br/>&gt; certain Kurdish ones also, steps of 124 and 165 cents<br/>&gt; may nicely fit the needs of the music -- and likewise<br/>&gt; the semi-neutral thirds, in polyphonic styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, here is a basic tuning for a Turkish<br/>&gt; interpretation of Makam Huseyni, using a conventional<br/>&gt; note spelling to reflect the chains of fifths:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; |-------------| |-------------|<br/>&gt; 0 4 7 12 17 21 24 29<br/>&gt; C# Eb E F# G# Bb B C#<br/>&gt; 0 166 290 497 703 869 993 1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Makam Huseyni in its basic &quot;textbook&quot; form consists<br/>&gt; of two tetrachords, with a tone between them, each<br/>&gt; having a large neutral second (ideally around 11:10),<br/>&gt; a small neutral second, and an upper tone. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; interesting that a small step of 124 cents, found<br/>&gt; here at Eb-E and Bb-B, may occur in certain Persian<br/>&gt; modes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The third interval family of 29-EDO consists of rather<br/>&gt; complex intervals favored by many of the world&apos;s musical<br/>&gt; traditions, here termed _interseptimal_ intervals because<br/>&gt; they occur in the middle region between two septimal<br/>&gt; ratios such as the large 8:7 tone (231 cents) and the<br/>&gt; small 7:6 minor third (267 cents). In 29-EDO, we get<br/>&gt; an intriguing size from 14 fifths up of 248 cents --<br/>&gt; sometimes called a hemifourth, because it&apos;s equal<br/>&gt; more or less (here precisely) to half of a fourth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hemifourths might suggest a simple septimal ratio<br/>&gt; like 8:7 or 7:6 -- and can delightfully be used<br/>&gt; contrapuntally in some styles as either a very<br/>&gt; wide tone or a very narrow minor third -- but are<br/>&gt; really a breed unto themselves. As it happens,<br/>&gt; the 29-EDO interval of 248 cents is a virtually<br/>&gt; just 15:13, while we also find intervals of<br/>&gt; 455 cents (near 13:10), 745 cents (near 20:13),<br/>&gt; and 952 cents (near 26:15).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These intervals are used in world musics such as<br/>&gt; Balinese or Javanese gamelan, and additionally may<br/>&gt; be introduced into other types of contexts where<br/>&gt; they provide distinctly &quot;xenharmonic&quot; material.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interseptimal intervals are closely related to<br/>&gt; another member of this third family: the diesis<br/>&gt; of 1/29 octave, or 41 cents, by which 12 fifths<br/>&gt; exceed 7 octaves. This family thus begins with<br/>&gt; a chain of 12 fifths producing the diesis itself,<br/>&gt; and continues as various regular intervals are<br/>&gt; altered by this diesis. Thus a regular 414-cent<br/>&gt; major third plus the diesis, or 497-cent fourth<br/>&gt; minus it, produces a 455-cent interval almost<br/>&gt; exactly at 13:10, somewhere between a usual<br/>&gt; septimal major third at 9:7 (435 cents) and<br/>&gt; a 4:3 fourth. The diesis might, for example,<br/>&gt; be interpreted in JI terms as a 40:39 (44 cents),<br/>&gt; the difference between 13:10 and 4:3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the adventurous, the 41-cent diesis may<br/>&gt; sometimes serve as an ultranarrow equivalent<br/>&gt; of a semitone, as may the larger 50-cent step<br/>&gt; in 24-EDO, for example. However, the diesis<br/>&gt; plays a vital role in the structure of the<br/>&gt; tuning for styles where it is unlikely to<br/>&gt; occur as a direct melodic step: for example,<br/>&gt; gamelan modes using the 248 cent hemifourths<br/>&gt; and other interseptimal intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In short, 29-EDO is a versatile system supporting<br/>&gt; an &quot;accentuated Pythagorean&quot; rendition of 13th-14th<br/>&gt; century European music; a family of &quot;semi-neutral&quot;<br/>&gt; intervals very useful for some Near Eastern styles,<br/>&gt; and sometimes applied to get a &quot;different&quot; sound<br/>&gt; for European music that might normally be played<br/>&gt; in a system like meantone, a well-temperament,<br/>&gt; or 12-EDO; and interseptimal intervals fitting<br/>&gt; various musical styles including gamelan as well<br/>&gt; as adventurous xenharmonicism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * * *<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is just a sample about how I might approach<br/>&gt; an EDO system -- or a regular or irregular temperament<br/>&gt; of some other variety, for that matter. In 31-EDO,<br/>&gt; for example, we would have regular meantone, septimal,<br/>&gt; and neutral families. Knowing where these intervals<br/>&gt; fall on the spectrum, with rational ratios providing<br/>&gt; one set of useful landmarks, is only part of the<br/>&gt; question; what styles the reader of such a description<br/>&gt; is interested in, or might become interested in, is<br/>&gt; another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=91383 href="#91383">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2010 3:30:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Whatever happened to ol&apos; Paul, anyway?
