It seems obvious to continue the pattern, so<br/>&gt; &gt; let&apos;s see what comes out. Keep in mind that the concept of stacking<br/>&gt; &gt; 81/80 and turning it into something else will lead us to exponentially<br/>&gt; &gt; larger and larger commas, so there&apos;s no way to avoid getting huge<br/>&gt; &gt; commas - it is best to not think about MOS&apos;s here at all and just<br/>&gt; &gt; modulate around the lattice. So here&apos;s what we get:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gravity: (81/80)^4 = 25/24<br/>&gt; &gt; 5&amp;67 temperament, eliminates 129140163/128000000, so named because the<br/>&gt; &gt; generator is a &quot;Grave&quot; fifth (or 27/20)<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=65_7&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=65_7&limit=5</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Absurdity: (81/80)^5 = 25/24<br/>&gt; &gt; 5&amp;84 temperament, eliminates 10460353203/10240000000, so named because<br/>&gt; &gt; this is just an absurd temperament. The generator is 81/80 and the<br/>&gt; &gt; period is 800/729, which is (10/9) / (81/80).<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_84&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_84&limit=5</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is where I&apos;ll stop. Keep in mind here that the approach is to<br/>&gt; &gt; come up with a &quot;lego block&quot; chord progression that shoots you up by<br/>&gt; &gt; 81/80, and then to just repeat this a few times until you end up at<br/>&gt; &gt; 25/24, at which point you can go back down. So really huge commas and<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments thought to be unusably complex might have some use if you<br/>&gt; &gt; use this approach.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll explore (81/80)^n = 16/15 next.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=99326 href="#99326">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2011 10:26:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, May 20, 2011 at 12:05 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (81/80)^3 is the &quot;naturally occuring&quot; instance of course- the first three you&apos;ve got there are pretty heavy-duty.
