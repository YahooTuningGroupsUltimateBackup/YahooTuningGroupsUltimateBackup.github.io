I know your interest in intonation is historically (correct me if i am wrong) and in that context 16/15 might not satisfy your concept of pure. Take for instance a string piece by hank badings where he used the harmonic series up in the 20s to set ancient greek tunes. i would say he is using pure intervals.

It is evidence that the composer liked the sound of<br/>&gt;&gt; diminished chords, in whatever tuning was around (or even regardless<br/>&gt;&gt; of the exact details of tuning!).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; The diminished 7th chords are spectacular in regular 1/6 comma,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; since<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; they&apos;re built of two pure tritones interlocked...and since it still<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; works strongly even if they get inverted or misspelled.
