My latest scale involves merging 12TET and the Infinity<br/>series and</p><p>A) Hits only 5 11-limit dyads across two octaves within about 7.5 cents or less<br/>B) Hits more like 44 dyads straight from the two versions of JI diatonic<br/>mentioned on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-limit_tuning">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-limit_tuning</a> (IE about 90% of the<br/>dyads are very periodic) within about 7.5 cents or less).  Those dyads include<br/>6/5,5/4,3/2,5/3,15/8,9/8,8/5, 9/5....all our old favorites.</p><p>  I am starting to think this is a key advantage of 12TET over JI diatonic and<br/>that it explains why some people actually prefer 12TET is its 12 consistent dyad<br/>sizes within an octave (actually this applies to any TET, though 12TET has an<br/>advantage over many due to low number of possible dyads).</p><p>    In 12TET you can say &quot;a 6th is always 900 cents, a 7th is always 1100<br/>cents...&quot; with perfect clarity in 12TET and near-perfect clarity (IE within<br/>about 7.5 cents for about 90% of dyads) in my latest scale.  And (in 12TET) that<br/>seems to really make things work EVEN though things like the major 3rd, major<br/>6th, tritone (1.414 instead of 10/7 or 7/5) , and 7th (1.8875 instead of 15/8)<br/>are significantly off.  In other words, it seems the balance of interval sizes<br/>almost outweighs the sourness of those intervals.</p><p>  Intervalic consistency seems to matter a good bit...along with periodicity,<br/>critical band, and other theories.

OTOH, things like &quot;harmonic stability&quot; (which is probably nothing more than &quot;beat frequency&quot;), &quot;intervallic identity&quot;, and &quot;rootedness&quot; seem to be both quantifiable and musically useful, so I&apos;m trying to get a better understanding of them.</p><p>Basically, I don&apos;t see much point in relating the tempered intervals in EDOs to ratios unless said ratios are actually musically-coherent.  So far, I&apos;ve interpreted the theory of harmonic entropy as suggesting that ratios only matter when they are simple and distant from nearby ratios of not-much-greater complexity.  IOW, if an EDO has an interval close to 6/5, that&apos;s significant, but close to a 13/11 not so much, because 13/11 is VERY close to 19/16, 20/17, 25/21, etc.  But I&apos;ve begun to wonder if this is a whole-enough picture, since it&apos;s based almost entirely on interval complexity as opposed to otonality, which I&apos;ve read is key to &quot;rootedness&quot;.  So I&apos;m trying to figure out how important otonality actually is in determining intervallic identity and harmonic stability.</p><p>So, I need a straight answer: do the odd harmonics in the 16-64 series provide rootedness and stability, despite their high complexity?

Hence that idea seems to<br/>explain mysteries I&apos;ve seen before, like how a C E F A chord in 12TET sounds so<br/>clear despite the nasty E-F dyad: the  C-E, C-F, E-A, F-A dyads seem to &quot;knock<br/>it into place&quot;.  IE a complex interval can act &quot;as if it&apos;s not there&quot; or even<br/>&quot;as a less complex interval&quot; in a sea of less-complex intervals, to an extent.</p><p>   Same seems to go with all those triads on your &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot;<br/>album with triads using the &quot;terrible&quot; 16/11 fifth that, oddly enough, sounded<br/>quite resolved.  The actual major and minor thirds making up that fifth though,<br/>as I recall, were fairly low-limit...enough to apparently trick the brain into<br/>thinking of the 16/11 as a 3/2.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I am strongly of the belief that consonance and dissonance depend entirely on<br/>&gt;musical context, and thus cannot be reduced to a set of dyad-related quantities,<br/>&gt;or even a set of formulas.&quot;<br/>  I don&apos;t think anything can be completely reduced to formulas...but I do think<br/>formulas can be used to explain things a high % of the time and that musical<br/>context can only violate them a limited (though still definitely large enough to<br/>be significant) amount.<br/>  I&apos;d guesstimate that if about 70% or more of the triads in a note point toward<br/>a certain root, the chord will sound fairly resolved.  And that includes if the<br/>chord is something like C E F A IE 12:15:16:20 (which at first glance, seems to<br/>scream &quot;15 odd-limit, high-dissonance&quot;), but doesn&apos;t sound high-limit at all in<br/>real life.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2010 4:19:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i do not think there has been enough prolonged exploration of these harmonics.<br/>I imagine it would be less but if this is a result of hearing them used in our culture or not.<br/> we already know something about lower harmonics just from 12 et.<br/> albeit a bit warped<br/> Especially divorced from their lower  harmonics.</p><p> it would be worth while for someone to explore and might accomplish more than speculation<br/> say a diamond or eikosany using 6 primes from the upper range. or use viggo bruns algorithm to make a scale out of a smaller set.</p><p>While we can say certain higher ratios appoximate lower ones, if we replace the lower ones in the same context the result is going to be different.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Kraig,<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, I need a straight answer: do the odd harmonics in the 16-64 series provide rootedness and stability, despite their high complexity?

One of the main focuses of<br/>Rothenberg&apos;g papers is to lay out a set of guidelines for deriving<br/>scales in which that still works.</p><p>One of his key ideas, for example, is that of &quot;propriety.&quot; A scale is<br/>proper if the largest third is still smaller than (or at least the<br/>same size as) the smallest fourth and so on for every interval.

Or because 7-equal just<br/>violates our existing 12-tet map, and only fits our diatonic hearing<br/>pattern, but not the chromatic one?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;5.1  If we do this uniformly across the lattice, the associated<br/>&gt; &#x9;comma pumps can all be performed without causing drift in our<br/>&gt; &#x9;pitch standard.&quot;<br/>&gt;    And this is what 12TET does to circles of 5ths and 3rds?</p><p>It means that chord progressions like Cmaj -&gt; Am -&gt; Dm7 -&gt; G7 are<br/>playable and will get you back to the same Cmaj without having to<br/>throw in really detuned Marcellian wolf fifths or so. It also means<br/>chord progressions like Dm7 -&gt; G7 -&gt; Cmaj work much more smoothly.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;This error is bounded by the<br/>&gt; size of the comma(s) being tempered out (trivial) and the number of<br/>&gt; concordant intervals over which it/they must vanish (complexity again).&quot;<br/>&gt;   So I&apos;m guessing the MORE intervals it vanishes over the less de-tuning needs to be done per note and thus the less error?</p><p>Yes, but I think the idea is also that tempering can help create new<br/>tonal systems in and of itself... and the LESS complex the comma, the<br/>better that works. For example, if you start looking at the list of<br/>5-limit commas, 81/80 is one of the smallest, and also not very<br/>complex. On the other hand, for temperaments like schismatic, you<br/>don&apos;t really get that same &quot;effect&quot; of merging a bunch of 3/2&apos;s and<br/>5/4, since it takes a lot of fourths to finally hit 5/4. So for<br/>temperaments like that, being as they&apos;re more complex, I tend to hear<br/>them as though they were still JI, but they can make things more<br/>efficient &quot;under the hook&quot; (e.g. keyboard mapping, having less notes<br/>to deal with, etc).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2010 3:44:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Besides 12 ET where are all these MOS scales around the world.?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The scales used in most music around the world are MOS, but note that<br/>&gt; there are a few exceptions, like the melodic minor and harmonic<br/>&gt; minor/major scales.

In 10:12:15 the outer dyad is 15:10 = 3/2,<br/>just like as in 9/6.  Now 10:12 is 6/5 and 6:7 is 7/6 (both virtually of the<br/>same class).<br/>  So that&apos;s two of three dyads that have relatively the same feel...and the<br/>brain seems to be able to get enough feel by those two to &quot;forgive&quot; the 7:9 =<br/>9/7 for not being a 15:12 = 5/4.</p><p>   I don&apos;t think it has anything to do with 12TET vs. JI...I think it has to do<br/>much more with things like how much &quot;slack&quot; you get for purity for some dyads<br/>when you purify others. And, on the other hand, how trying for too much purity<br/>can be like pinching pennies and give diminishing marginal return.</p><p>  That and...if any of dyads in a triad or greater chord cause so much critical<br/>band dissonance it distorts the sense of periodicity each &quot;pure&quot; dyad gains.<br/>Which, to me, explains why having a 17/16-ish dyad in an inverted 7th chord is<br/>fine but having a &quot;triad&quot; with two 17/16&apos;s (even though 17/16 * 17/16 = almost a<br/>perfect 9/8) doesn&apos;t work so well and a lot of the 9/8th-ish-ness is killed.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2010 6:33:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t see where i was saying anything different than you but in this case of  the Tenney limit i find useless and unfounded and never works.<br/> It treats all inversions the same in all ranges and at best a giant step backwards from Helmholtz.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Kraig&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think a music based on 9 tone rows would be an improvement<br/>&gt; over 12.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Right, and I was agreeing with you on that.

Try the chord 8:9:10.  Now try  36:40:45 AKA 1/1 10/9<br/>5/4.  Oddly enough, they sound about the same to me far as resolved-ness with<br/>the 8:9:10 sounding only slightly better...the 8:9:10 doesn&apos;t seem to have a<br/>clear lead.<br/>  Oddly enough, this seems to suggest periodicity and (root tone) critical band<br/>can both have little effect...but the harmonic entropy graph and Sethares&apos;<br/>culmulative critical band dissonance graph seem to make more sense in this case<br/>as they show between 12/11 and 9/8 have about the same &quot;entropy level&quot;.</p><p>  Note comparing 8:9:10 and 36:40:45 is like comparing major to minor...it&apos;s an<br/>interval reversal.<br/>  The only difference is the intervals are so close that the brain doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to care much (IE there&apos;s no clear advantage here as there is in resolved-ness of<br/>a diatonic major vs. minor triad).<br/>  Which seems to suggest equally spaced intervals may be ideal for clustered<br/>chords...move the 11/10 or 9/8 (or anything in between) dyad formed by the<br/>second note in either chord either further up or down and the chord sounds less<br/>and less resolved.  This seems to imply critical band dissonance is kicking in<br/>as well...and perhaps over-riding the effect of periodicity for such clustered<br/>intervals.</p><p>3)   Now try 3:5:10 AKA 1/1 5/3 10/3 vs. 1/1 11/6 10/3 AKA 6:11:20.  By this<br/>point things are so spread out that periodicity seems to dominate and the 3:5:10<br/>has a clear advantage.</p><p>4)  But trying even 5:7:9 vs. 30:42:55 AKA 1/1 7/5 11/6...the latter still<br/>sounds more resolved...though at 1/1 7/5 21/11 the lack of periodicity finally<br/>seems to make the 5:7:9 sound substantially clearer.</p><p>5) Now for something in-between, try the mildly spread out chord of 12:15:20 AKA<br/>1/1 5/4 5/3 vs. 1/1 11/9 5/3 AKA 9:11:15.  Here the resolvedness actually seems<br/>about the same...and I&apos;m guessing the not-so-dramatic overall periodicity<br/>advantage of the second chord as a whole works in its favor while the<br/>not-so-dramatic advantage of the first chord&apos;s simpler dyads and slight critical<br/>band advantage (15/12 vs. 11/9) work in the first chord&apos;s favor.</p><p>-------------------------------</p><p>So it seems to be a pattern (so far, at least)<br/>1) Second or smaller intervals are perhaps mostly effected by critical band over<br/>anything else. You have to screw up periodicity pretty miserably for the<br/>mistakes to be heard in clustered chords.</p><p>2) Intervals up to about 5/4 (with another bump at about 4/3) are effected<br/>significantly by the critical band, but periodicity begins to become more<br/>important as you move further out.<br/>  In the case of the 22/15 chord, the periodicity is &quot;not so good&quot;, but the<br/>large distance advantage so far as critical band seems to manage to make up for<br/>it.</p><p>3) In chords with large intervals (IE those over 3/2), lack of periodicity can<br/>really begin to make things sound tense...but it still takes a lot of lack of<br/>periodicity (think having half or more of the dyads as having a &apos;nearest JI<br/>fraction&apos; denominator of 11 or higher) to really send things astray.</p><p>4) Of course, added overall &quot;odd limit&quot; periodicity or dyadic periodicity or<br/>critical band distance almost never hurts...but it seems to become a problem<br/>when you throw everything in one direction (dyadic periodicity, overall<br/>periodicity, or critical band) and forget about the other two you can find loads<br/>of examples where following a theory &quot;perfectly&quot; actually gives you a more<br/>&quot;sour&quot; chord.</p><p>Thoughts?

Obviously dyadic.</p><p>3) By Tenney Height the chord 5:6:7:8 would be the 4th root of 5*6*7*8.  I&apos;d say<br/>it&apos;s debatable whether this is dyadic of not, since each additional note in the<br/>chord means one additional multiplication is needed for the calculation.  It<br/>rather seems to assume if one number in the chord is huge, it always makes the<br/>chord sound much worse, even if all the other numbers and dyads used in the<br/>chord are very simple.</p><p>4) Harmonic Entropy of chords...likes Sethares, is based on a curve and sum of<br/>dyads, only it rates dyads based an ambiguity rather than beating.</p><p>5) The Erlich survey you gave me of chords...gives no explanation (at least so<br/>far as you said it) for the order of consonance...this leading me to believe it<br/>is done by ear unless noted otherwise.

I thought about just such an example a lot last night, and I think because of the fact 60:75:88 is actually *closer* to 4:5:6 than 8:12:13, the theory holds.  IOW, it&apos;s not enough just to look at the harmonics and say &quot;this one is higher harmonics, so it&apos;s going to sound more discordant&quot;.  Higher harmonics can approximate lower harmonics, so it&apos;s actually the middle harmonics that are going to be the most discordant, since they&apos;re the maximum distance from the lowest harmonics.  This is definitely borne out by harmonic entropy, where maxima occur pretty close to 11/8 and 13/8.</p><p>Also, consider a chord like 16:20:25 vs. 4:5:6.  Since major thirds are more consonant than minor according to pretty much every theory, why isn&apos;t two major thirds more consonant than a major plus a minor?  Or why isn&apos;t a 9:12:16 more consonant than a 4:5:6, since the fourth is more consonant than the major third (also according to pretty much every theory).  These examples show that having greater pitch-distance between intervals is not the key, and also that being composed of simple dyads is also not the key.</p><p>What I think might debunk this theory, at least as a theory of *consonance*, is Bohlen-Pierce music.  3:5:7 implies a harmonic series very strongly, but I&apos;ll be damned if I&apos;d call it &quot;consonant&quot;.  Also, I think a lot of us here might actually prefer 4:5:6 over 3:4:5, due to our cultural bias for the former voicing.</p><p>The problem with theories like this, IMHO, is that they conflate &quot;stability&quot; (or &quot;concordance&quot;, if you prefer) with &quot;consonance&quot;.  Two very different phenomena.  Intervals like 11/6 or 7/5 are more stable than intervals like 13/11 or 27/16, but I&apos;d be lying through my teeth if I told you I thought the first two sound &quot;nicer&quot; or &quot;more resolved&quot; or &quot;calmer&quot; or what have you.  A triadic theory of consonance could probably be binary: if a triad is close enough to 4:5:6 or 1/(4:5:6) for the ear to &quot;round it&quot;, it&apos;s consonant.  If not?  It&apos;s dissonant.  Why?  Because of our cultural custom.  We are accustomed most strongly to major and minor triads, so we will prefer things that sound like them over things that don&apos;t (unless we&apos;re into that &quot;avant garde&quot; stuff, in which case we&apos;re not representative of the general population anyway and our opinion shouldn&apos;t be taken in to account).  Our preference will run from stable&amp;familiar, to unstable&amp;familiar, to stable&amp;unfamiliar, to unstable&amp;unfamiliar.  I simply can&apos;t imagine someone rating a 12-tET major chord as sounding &quot;less resolved&quot; than a pure 5:6:7 chord.  The latter is essentially a diminished triad, which most people find the tempered version of to be the strongest dissonance available.  A Just dissonance is still a dissonance.</p><p>This is why, as a guitarist, I find the term &quot;stability&quot; more useful.  Stability tells me nothing more (or less) than how much fuzz gain I can apply to a chord before it turns into mush.  To me, it is more important to know that there are stable intervals somewhere in the tuning than to know whether the tuning approximates a major triad or not.  The first question I always ask about a new tuning system: what can I use as a power-chord?  In 16-EDO, for instance, I find the 900-cent ~27/16 nicer-sounding than the 1050-cent ~11/6, but the 1050-cent interval works as a power-chord while the 900-cent interval doesn&apos;t.  This is why I like 16-EDO better than 14 or 15 or 17; all of those do a better job of approximating major and minor triads, but neither has as many stable intervals as 16.</p><p>But I digress...the point is, Carl&apos;s harmonic series theory probably works as well as it does because 4:5:6=a major triad, and thus the harmonic series is consistent with our culturally-infused preferences.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2010 3:09:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Actually, I don&apos;t think it *does* debunk the theory.

So no, these are not middle harmonics.</p><p>&gt;    So yes, I agree with your points about rounding higher to lower harmonics,<br/>&gt; o-tonality vs. u-tonality and such, but don&apos;t see how they in the vaguest apply<br/>&gt; to my above example...which still seems neither harmonically o-tonal/u-tonal or<br/>&gt; to relate closely to lower harmonics for the most part.</p><p>Again, your chord is basically a major third plus a sharp subminor third, which translates to a major triad (4:5:6) with a somewhat-flattened fifth.  It is still distinctly identifiable as a major triad, despite the mistuning.  The 8:12:13 triad is a perfect fifth with an added neutral sixth, which is not remotely like a major triad (4:5:6).  Hence, the more complex triad is more &quot;consonant&quot;, because it is closer to a major triad.  It is not as consonant as a 4:5:6, but it is still more consonant than an 8:12:13.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;60:75:88 is actually *closer* to 4:5:6 than 8:12:13, the theory holds.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    My overall point has nothing to do with what harmonic series closer is closer<br/>&gt; to what other one, but rather saying that NON-harmonic series chords can share<br/>&gt; similar properties to harmonic series ones.</p><p>Every chord can be a harmonic series chord.  The harmonic series is infinite, and no matter what the chord, you can find an arbitrarily-good approximation of it somewhere in the series.</p><p>&gt;    Specifically, my point is that although o-tonality obviously works in many<br/>&gt; cases for consonance, the favoring of the brain of chords which place<br/>&gt; larger-spaced ratios at lower frequencies is not exclusive to chords near<br/>&gt; patterns from the harmonic series (IE 4:5:6, 5:8:9, etc.).</p><p>Your example failed to show this, and in fact only supported the point that you were trying to disprove (i.e. that a badly-tuned 4:5:6 sounds more consonant to our ears than a well-tuned 8:12:13).</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2010 3:25:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Your example failed to show this, and in fact only supported the point that you<br/>&gt;were trying to disprove (i.e. that a badly-tuned 4:5:6 sounds more consonant to<br/>&gt;our ears than a well-tuned 8:12:13).&quot;</p><p>    Firstly, I&apos;m favoring the 60:75:88, not the 8:12:13.

You seem<br/>to think the &quot;fact&quot; 60:75:88 comes across to you as a 4:5:6, despite my never<br/>bringing it up as a point in my topic,  is utterly relevant to the 60:75:88&apos;s<br/>sounding better.<br/>  I am trying to prove that having close fit to the harmonic series (close<br/>meaning...within 12 or so cents) is not always a good predictor of consonance.<br/>And I am using 60:75:88 because 2 of its 3 dyads are nowhere near within 12<br/>cents of anything low in the harmonic series...as an example of a &quot;weird chord<br/>that works surprisingly well&quot;.  You seem to say the 60:75:88 is somehow<br/>equivalent of &quot;really&quot; low in the harmonic series despite these far-off dyads.</p><p>Argh...I&apos;m digging up my original message...<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;original message&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>Carl&gt;&quot;Its fit to a harmonic series?&quot;<br/>   Well here we go again...  Carl I hear what you are saying, I just don&apos;t agree<br/>with it...and yes I can understand something without agreeing with it.  Sure,<br/>something very low in the harmonic series IE 3:4:5 or 6:7:8 is almost always<br/>going to work.<br/>  But try 8:12:13 vs. 60:75:88.  Note 60:75:88 has a 5/4 dyad from 75/60 and a<br/>not-so-far from 7/6 dyad of 88/75...but perhaps more importantly a huge critical<br/>band advantage in having a closest dyad of about 7/6 vs. 13/12!&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>...yes, I said advantage as in....I&apos;m favoring the 60:75:88!</p><p>   Note I mention my points of difference in terms of critical band and dyads<br/>formed AND make my point relating to things low vs. high in the harmonic series,<br/>and not specific to a certain chord.</p><p>   But, ok, you appear to be taking what I take as a long shot anyhow and saying<br/>my argument is really about 4:5:6 and &quot;low in the harmonic series&quot; has to mean<br/>4:5:6 and then assuming things like 35+ cent deviations from dyads in 4:5:6<br/>still point strongly to 4:5:6.</p><p>Now you replied:<br/>&gt;&quot;Well, obviously it&apos;s quite a bit off, but it&apos;s a whole hell of a lot closer to<br/>&gt;4:5:6 than is the 8:12:13 you used to compare it with. And if you play that<br/>&gt;chord, I *dare* you to tell me you don&apos;t hear it as a less-stable/more-vibrating<br/>&gt;version of a major triad.&quot;</p><p>   I&apos;m not talking about tonal &quot;character&quot; here, I&apos;m talking about stability.<br/>An on-topic comparison would be get a listener to tell me they find 8:12:13 more<br/>stable/resolved sounding than 60:75:88.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Actually, that&apos;s kind of the whole point of harmonic entropy, that this is<br/>&gt;possible, except for intervals at the local maxima, where multiple higher<br/>&gt;harmonics/odd-limit ratios coincide in the same pitch-range, and all are too<br/>&gt;distant from nearby simple ratios to be interpreted either way.&quot;<br/>   Right that&apos;s the basic idea.  But again look at my original message.  I noted<br/>two things that I think cause more sourness in the 8:12:13 chord.  Critical band<br/>and the amount of periodicity of its dyads.  Nothing about being pro or anti<br/>harmonic entropy (harmonic entropy is not equal to periodicity).</p><p>    But if I get what you are saying, you are saying that since dyads in<br/>60:75:88 are not &quot;that far&quot; from the humps in the harmonic entropy graph IE<br/><a href="http://www.soundofindia.com/showarticle.asp?in_article_id=1905806937...that">http://www.soundofindia.com/showarticle.asp?in_article_id=1905806937...that</a> the<br/>brain not only hears it as a 4:5:6, but ALSO hear it as being as resolved as a<br/>4:5:6.  Now 88/75 = a bit over 7/6...near a relative &quot;low point&quot; on the curve<br/>and vaguely near 6/5.  75/60, I agree, is a 5/4 (as I admitted before) and<br/>obviously acts as one (IE from a 4:5:6 chord).   This leads me toward the 88/60<br/>aka 22/15.  It is pretty close to the high entropy point south of 3:2 thus<br/>indicating a &quot;sour note&quot; on his graph.<br/>   Thus harmonic entropy analysis seems to give a sweet dyad, a not so sweet<br/>dyad, and a screaming in pain sour dyad. :-D  So even if your argument is that<br/>&quot;the reason 60:75:88 works has to do with how well it works via harmonic entropy<br/>which thus &apos;makes it a 4:5:6&apos; &quot; I still am left with many doubts.</p><p>&gt;&quot;the noble mediant is closer to 16/11. 22/15 is just on the 3/2 side of 16/11,<br/>&gt;so it falls into 3/2&apos;s field of attraction.&quot;<br/>  But the Harmonic Entropy curve doesn&apos;t seem to have a sudden jump, but a<br/>continuous, well, curve.  Thus, yes, 22/15 is rated better than 16/11 on that<br/>curve...I&apos;m just saying that it is not rated as better by much...the rate of<br/>&quot;better-ness acceleration&quot; is not that high at that point...at least from what I<br/>can read of the graph.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Lousy, yes. But still approximations. I.e. 22/15 is still more an approximation<br/>&gt;of a fifth than it is an approximation of any other &quot;tunable-by-ear&quot; interval.<br/>&gt;If you had to round it to the nearest simple ratio, it would be 3/2.&quot;<br/>  Exactly, it&apos;s a &quot;lousy&quot; 5th by Harmonic Entropy (HE) standards.  And my<br/>argument here is about resolved-ness: I&apos;m taking the points the HE and<br/>periodicity cause the differences in my example and you seem to be introducing a<br/>point that you think HE (instead) explains it.  But I&apos;m saying, &quot;even&quot; HE<br/>doesn&apos;t appear to explain it and 22/15 comes across as &quot;not much more resolved<br/>than the 16/11 mediant&quot;...regardless of if the brain can still scrape itself to<br/>recognize &quot;yeah, it&apos;s a type of fifth&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Hence, the more complex triad is more &quot;consonant&quot;, because it is closer to a<br/>&gt;major triad. It is not as consonant as a 4:5:6, but it is still more consonant<br/>&gt;than an 8:12:13.&quot;<br/>   Well ok (finally?) we&apos;re back to talking (or at least trying to talk about)<br/>consonance rather than degrees of ambiguity.

However, you are arguing that this fact disproves Carl&apos;s harmonic series model, whereas I am arguing that it supports it.  My argument is that despite the fact that 60:75:88 is too far off to sound &quot;just like&quot; 4:5:6, it is close enough to sound like a &quot;very out of tune&quot; 4:5:6.  8:12:13 does not sound *anything* like a 4:5:6 at all, not even remotely.  8:12 is about 315 cents sharp of 4:5, and 12:13 is about, what, 175 cents flat of 5:6.  What I am arguing, thus, is that Carl&apos;s harmonic series model suggests that the closer a chord is to 4:5:6, the more consonant it will be.  Carl never said this, but I think he would have to in order to make sense.  If his theory didn&apos;t state this, then it would be quite susceptible to the objection you are raising.  I never said 60:75:88 is as resolved-sounding or as consonant as 4:5:6, just that it&apos;s *closer* to 4:5:6 than the 8:12:13.  Since it&apos;s closer to 4:5:6, it &quot;fits&quot; the lower harmonics &quot;better&quot; than the 8:12:13a perfect example of higher harmonics being closer to low harmonics than the &quot;middle&quot; harmonics.  60:88 is closer to a fifth than is 8:13.  60:75 is closer to a major third than is 8:12.

Really, what I think is going on is that 4:5:6 is the most stable representation of a major chord, which is the most familiar chord in our culture.  It is, in a sense, our ideal of &quot;what sounds good&quot;, and I think that due to cultural conditioning, people will prefer something that sounds familiar--even if out-of-tune--to something that sounds very unfamiliar, even if it&apos;s very in-tune.</p><p>&gt;    To make it clear again...I think it works most of the time (say 85-90%)...but<br/>&gt; there are enough counter-examples to make me wonder if there is a hack.

There&apos;s no &quot;hack&quot; for aesthetic preferences.  In many cultures, people can sing neutral thirds and neutral seconds reliably, at least melodically or against a drone, and probably think those intervals sound quite nice.  Here in the West, those intervals are so unfamiliar that most people consider them dissonances, or at best &quot;alien&quot; intervals that they have no way of interpreting.  Humanistically-speaking, I think you can get away at the very least with any scale, so long as its intervals are spread somewhat-evenly across an interval somewhat close to an octave; with such a scale, someone somewhere will find the music pleasant.  I guarantee it.</p><p>&gt;   I feel funny because before you seems to be promoting the idea that 2 of 3<br/>&gt; dyads in a chord allows the third dyad to be off (seems to open a lot of<br/>&gt; possibilities)...but now you seem to be saying nothing creative can be done with<br/>&gt; it unless than overall structure rounds some low-in-the-harmonic-series chord<br/>&gt; (tear tear). :-D  This is sad because it seems to say the only good way to go is<br/>&gt; by simply enabling the same old 5-limit (and maybe occasionally 7-limit) type<br/>&gt; chords/moods in different ways.</p><p>Like I said, the only thing I was arguing was that your objection to Carl&apos;s theory wasn&apos;t valid.  I believe Carl&apos;s theory is pretty valid for our culture, but not universally-valid for humankind and not necessarily the most helpful theory for dealing with tunings where a near-4:5:6 isn&apos;t an option.</p><p>However, Carl has quite neatly shown that putting simple dyads together is not by any means always effective.  Lots of simple dyads, when combined, make nasty chords, as I noted with chords like 12:15:25 (a stack of 5/4&apos;s), or 9:12:16 (a stack of 4/3&apos;s), or even 5:6:7.  So while I used to think that if a dyad could be split into two simpler dyads (the way 21/16 splits into 9/8 and 7/6), that dyad could be rendered consonant if played as a triad of its simpler components, I see now that that theory fails in more places than it succeeds.</p><p>That said, I *still* don&apos;t understand why I find 16:18:21 to be so dang nice-sounding.

I&apos;d think a<br/>&gt; &gt; chord like 1/1-5/4-3/2-7/4-9/4-8/3 would be more concordant<br/>&gt; &gt; than a 4:5:6:7:9:11 chord, but the latter one fits the<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic series better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;d think it would, but did you try it?

Backing off the on the degree &quot;polyphony&quot; (in the MIDI/synth sense, not the compositional sense) from hexads to triads, of which the latter are generally more intelligible from a consonance standpoint, can you explain why I hear 5:6:7 as being more dissonant than 16:18:21?  Or why I find 4:5:6 more consonant than 3:4:5?  These, I can assure you, I have tried, and my preference is undeniably for the higher-harmonic chords, even if they are somewhat &quot;less stable&quot;.

Something more like 12-14 cents error, ok...but<br/>20+...not to my ears.  To me that&apos;s almost like saying a  (shrunk) 9:11:13 chord<br/>and a wider 4:5:6 chord are comparable in resolved-ness...pretty big jump IMVHO.</p><p>ME&gt; The thing I keep seeing with your argument that bugs me...is<br/>&gt; you seem to be saying the brain can hear anything vaguely near a low-limit<br/>&gt;chord<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; like 4:5:6 or 5:6:7 as that chord and that even larger-than-commatic dyadic<br/>&gt; differences in 2 of 3 dyads in a chord can be thrown aside.  ...Now if such<br/>&gt;were<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; true wouldn&apos;t a chord like 1/1 6/5 11/8 supposedly be much more consonant than<br/>&gt;a<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 16:18:21 simply because the former is &quot;closer to a 5:6:7...which is lower down</p><p>&gt; the series than a 16:18:21&quot;?</p><p>Igs&gt;&quot;Also FWIW, I think 5:6:7 is an excellent example of a gaping failure of the<br/>theory to predict consonance, because 5:6:7 is, at least to my ears, a<br/>&quot;beat-less dissonance&quot;....Even a pure 5:6:7 sounds less resolved than a 16:18:21<br/>to me. Though the 16:18:21 is far less stable, and doesn&apos;t sound very &quot;clean&quot; in<br/>low registers with harmonic timbres. The 5:6:7 is OTOH very clean-sounding.&quot;</p><p>  I have noticed this as well, especially for things like chords starting at the<br/>5th harmonic.  Some parts of the series, no matter how periodic and<br/>&quot;major&quot;/&quot;o-tonal&quot; mathematically, just seem to have a sour mood.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Not which &quot;matters most&quot;. What matters most is, and always has been, the<br/>&gt;aesthetic preferences of listeners and composers, and that simply cannot be<br/>&gt;predicted or formalized with 100% accuracy (maybe 80% or 90% on a good day).&quot;<br/>   I&apos;d be happy with a steady 80%...and have yet to find a well-established<br/>theory that will give me that.  I&apos;ve found having 70% of the chord&apos;s dyads sound<br/>good individually usually means a good chord more than anything else (sometimes<br/>this means the dyads have good critical band, other times periodicity, other<br/>times neither AKA the 5:6:7 example failing).</p><p>&gt;&quot;There&apos;s no &quot;hack&quot; for aesthetic preferences. In many cultures, people can sing<br/>&gt;neutral thirds and neutral seconds reliably, at least melodically or against a<br/>&gt;drone, and probably think those intervals sound quite nice.&quot;<br/>  I don&apos;t think there is a foolproof hack...but I am suspicious something could<br/>be close enough to convince people neutral seconds and thirds and such can be<br/>used in chords and not, say, for the type of monophonic structures often in<br/>ethnic music.  One fleeting example of this: Jacky Ligon&apos;s work for the &quot;Crack<br/>My Pitch Up&quot; album; people who usually think micro-tonal music is wrist-slitting<br/>music think it&apos;s oddly relaxing.  And he uses neutral seconds extensively in<br/>chords and harmony.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Humanistically-speaking, I think you can get away at the very least with any<br/>&gt;scale, so long as its intervals are spread somewhat-evenly across an interval<br/>&gt;somewhat close to an octave; with such a scale, someone somewhere will find the<br/>&gt;music pleasant. I guarantee it.&quot;<br/>  So you are saying ET scales have an instant advantage?  I think the problem is<br/>people have trouble making or finding scales that are &quot;multi-tonal&quot; rather than<br/>&quot;a-tonal&quot;.  Meaning that people think<br/>A) TET scale like 12TET are &quot;tonal&quot; because certain chords can be depended on<br/>the sound resolved regardless of transposition and certain notes are stressed<br/>(namely tonic and dominant as &apos;relaxed&apos; chord roots).<br/>B) People think anything not TET must drop virtually all ability to have certain<br/>dependable intervals across the scale so they call it &quot;a-tonal&quot; as in &quot;lacking<br/>any dominant tones&quot; rather than &quot;multi-tonal&quot;.  The idea that you can have, say,<br/>two different types of second of which you get different ones by switching the<br/>root (IE in Jacky Ligon&apos;s scales) and still have the ability to use them in<br/>similarly strong and confident ways.</p><p>   IMVHO, the term a-tonal should be scrapped...it seems to give the impression<br/>that odd chords and unequal temperaments can never point to a reliable sense of<br/>resolved-ness.</p><p>&gt;&quot;However, Carl has quite neatly shown that putting simple dyads together is not<br/>&gt;by any means always effective. Lots of simple dyads, when combined, make nasty<br/>&gt;chords, as I noted with chords like 12:15:25 (a stack of 5/4&apos;s), or 9:12:16 (a<br/>&gt;stack of 4/3&apos;s), or even 5:6:7.&quot;<br/>  Well 5:6:7 fails under both theories.  But you&apos;re right (to my ears) about<br/>Carl&apos;s point with the stack of 5/4&apos;s and 4/3rd&apos;s.  Then again I&apos;ve found that&apos;s<br/>almost universally a bad idea to stack the same interval on top of itself<br/>regardless of the theory...it&apos;s basically a recipe for commas.  Also when you<br/>think about it...you are pointing to the same harmonic series with equal<br/>strength in two different places...how on earth would you expect you brain to<br/>put importance on one over the other clearly/easily?</p><p>&gt;&quot;So while I used to think that if a dyad could be split into two simpler dyads<br/>&gt;(the way 21/16 splits into 9/8 and 7/6), that dyad could be rendered consonant<br/>&gt;if played as a triad of its simpler components, I see now that that theory fails<br/>&gt;in more places than it succeeds.&quot;<br/>   Hmm...here&apos;s a challenge: find an example of a sour chord with sweet dyads<br/>that</p><p>A) Doesn&apos;t use stacked interval (as Carl&apos;s do)<br/>B) Doesn&apos;t use any dyads with bizarrely close critical band (IE 13/12 or closer)<br/>C) Isn&apos;t 5:6:7 :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;That said, I *still* don&apos;t understand why I find 16:18:21 to be so dang<br/>&gt;nice-sounding. Even if I&apos;m hearing it as a 9:10:12, I still don&apos;t know why I&apos;d<br/>&gt;like that better than 5:6:7, but I undeniably do. If Carl&apos;s theory can explain<br/>&gt;that, I guess I&apos;m sold.&quot;</p><p>   Call me pessimistic but, I&apos;m betting Carl&apos;s &quot;theory&quot; can&apos;t because, so far,<br/>I&apos;ve seen it as very much pointing to &quot;anything low enough in &apos;odd limit&apos; is<br/>automatically golden&quot;.</p><p>   I find the 8th and 16th harmonic very odd.  15/8 even by itself, for example,<br/>is relatively high limit but sounds rather resolved to my ear and more strong<br/>than, say 11/6 or 9/5 despite being more &quot;shaky/beating&quot;.  I&apos;d say it&apos;s a &quot;mood<br/>thing&quot;...but it would be great if someone could explain it mathematically.<br/>  The other thing obvious to me is 16:18:21 has 9/8 and 7/6 in it (yep, the<br/>classic 2 out of 3 solid dyads with little critical band dissonance).  Try<br/>16:19:21...I swear it&apos;s even better because the brain seems to like progression<br/>in chord from lower/larger to higher/smaller intervals...no clue why but I<br/>haven&apos;t found any counter-examples for that one no matter how close/far a chord<br/>is from the beginning of the harmonic series.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2010 8:49:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;I thought &quot;consonant&quot; just meant &quot;pleasing to listen to&quot; and<br/>&quot;stability/concordance&quot; meant &quot;degree of beat-lessness&quot;.

We can measure &quot;green&quot; as stimulation of specific nerves by specific frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, with appropriate neurological sequelae in the visual cortex.  We can safely predict all light within the range of &quot;green&quot; will stimulate the optic nerves uniformly in all healthy individuals, and that there will be at least some uniformity in the neurological sequelae.  Different cultures divide the color spectrum differently, of course, so at some points the sequelae will diverge depending on culture and individual associations with the initial stimuli.  But to a point, there is uniformity.  &quot;Pretty&quot; is something that we cannot reduce in such a way; the stimuli capable of producing the brain-state associated with &quot;pretty&quot; are too non-uniform to be modeled accurately and completely.

In psychoacoustics, the latter is<br/>&gt; called &quot;sensory consonance&quot; or &quot;consonance&quot; for short and<br/>&gt; that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been doing in this thread.<br/>&gt;<br/>So in tuning list vernacular, &quot;consonance&quot; is related to &quot;all the cues music can convey&quot;, but in psychoacoustics, it means the same as &quot;concordance&quot; in tuning list vernacular (which takes into account only certain selected cues), and you have been using the psychoacoustics definition instead of the tuning list vernacular definition.

You *just* gave me a definition of consonance that is different from that of concordance, which means there is basis for a semantic distinction.  Are you retracting that in the same breath, saying consonance *shouldn&apos;t* be (or isn&apos;t) distinct from concordance?</p><p>&gt; There we don&apos;t<br/>&gt; want anything to do with melody, rhythm, cultural<br/>&gt; conditioning, artistic intent, mood imagery, etc.  We just<br/>&gt; want the instantaneous sensation of &quot;restfulness&quot; and &quot;purity&quot;.</p><p>Oh, of course.  Because, you know, music has nothing to do with cultural conditioning, artistic intent, mood imagery, etc.  If you want to study and understand music, of course it makes sense to leave out all the things that distinguish &quot;music&quot; from &quot;sound&quot;.  Psychoacoustics is to music what color psychology is to art.  Knowing the effect the color green has on human mood won&apos;t tell you why (or whether) a Van Gogh painting is beautiful, nor will it tell you how to paint like him.  It&apos;ll tell you what effect staring at a green wall has on human mood, nothing more.  It&apos;s valuable in its own right, but not necessarily in any aesthetic sense.  But if color psychologists started running around saying &quot;green is a prettier color than red because it&apos;s more relaxing to the mood&quot;, I think we&apos;d all know that to be nonsense.  This is why it is important not to conflate measurable objective properties--like concordance--with subjective properties like consonance (aka &quot;sonic prettiness&quot;) or musical usefulness.  It leads to making claims that cannot be tested or substantiated meaningfully.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So you admit, there may be another component to it beyond<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;fit&quot; to a harmonic series?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ???

But I&apos;ll tell you this much, even though I listened to your<br/>discussion on how 5:7:9 points to 4 (a root other than 5) and this hurts its<br/>rooted-ness.<br/>I&apos;d be interested to hear more examples of how rootedness &quot;works&quot; because I have<br/>yet to see the pattern that defines it clearly.</p><p>   On the side...your saying something akin to &quot;16:18:21 more consonant than<br/>5:7:9...you must be crazy&quot; to Igs before seems again to hint that you&apos;re heavily<br/>biased toward periodicity/tonality over all other theories (say you had good<br/>periodicity/tonality in a but bad rooted-ness, critical band dissonance, badly<br/>symmetrical beating, etc.).  Such statements do seem to sound like tonality is<br/>your pet hypothesis, whether you mean them to or not.

Concordance as related to calculate-able psycho-acoustics (IE<br/>critical band, periodicity, harmonic entropy, Tenney height, etc.) and<br/>consonance as the overall sense of relaxation/pleasantness (though typically<br/>referring to having a strong sense of rooted-ness/together-ness).</p><p>  Personally since various types of concordance also fit under the definition of<br/>consonance...I typically forgive confusion between the two by others and call<br/>the overall goal &quot;resolved-ness&quot;, reflecting a sense of peace in the notes not<br/>biased toward any one theory (IE not the way consonance is often specific to<br/>having a root).  So, to me, if by odd chance a chord sounds relaxed...even if it<br/>breaks every concordance theory known to man, it can still be strong on<br/>&quot;resolved-ness&quot;.<br/>  So what makes resolved-ness more than just an opinion?  A significant<br/>percentage of people showing a chord/dyad/etc. sounds more relaxed to them.<br/>15/8 in particular surprises me this way as it sounds much more resolved to me<br/>than any of the major concordance theories say it &quot;should&quot; sound, as does the C<br/>E F A chord.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2010 9:59:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;As Claude Debussy once put it, &quot;B D E# F# G# A# E#&quot;<br/>   I&apos;ll say this much...stacking near 9/8ths doesn&apos;t bother me a bit.

This is the view of Johannes Boen in 1357,<br/>who considers such a diminished fourth, a comma narrow of a<br/>ditone at 81/64, as a &quot;consonance by situation&quot; (_consonantia<br/>per accidens_) if supported by a regular major third below,<br/>e.g. E-G#-C.

Whether that reflects a view that they<br/>&gt;       are still somehow dissonant, even though the<br/>&gt;       sweetness of the otonal thirds was admired, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>This is an interesting question, and I might nuance my language<br/>a bit to describe the situation in the young Dufay&apos;s epoch around<br/>1420-1440, the situation around 1500, and the situation in the<br/>later 16th century (say Lasso or Palestrina).</p><p>In the early and middle 15th century, while sonorities with thirds<br/>(and sixths) become more and pervasive, there&apos;s still the<br/>expectation that we&apos;ll eventually cadence on a trine or fifth.<br/>This expectation, which in many ways is coupled with directed<br/>progressions and organizational schemes not too different from<br/>&quot;classic&quot; ones of the 14th century (which I still find myself<br/>using in the 21st century), feels very basic to me in the<br/>appeal of many of Dufay&apos;s early chansons, fauxbourdon settings,<br/>and some Mass settings and motets.</p><p>As things move on, and likely we are moving into the early<br/>meantone era of keyboard tuning in more and more places,<br/>sonorities with thirds are reaching a status of &quot;almost<br/>stable.&quot; In lots of the music of Busnois and Ockeghem,<br/>for example, I&apos;d still expect to hear a final sonority<br/>of 2:3:4 (or, with the wider spacing that becomes common,<br/>often 1:2:3:4 or the like), or maybe even a simple octave<br/>(common in some three-voice writing).</p><p>Around 1500, say in a popular four-voice style like the<br/>Cancionero de Palacio in Spain, I&apos;d expect to hear<br/>a third-plus-fifth-or-sixth type of sonority (as Zarlino<br/>puts it later, in 1558) just about anywhere within a<br/>phrase, but with a final cadence on 2:3:4 or the like<br/>still very common and delightful -- yes, in keyboard<br/>performance, in 1/4-comma meantone or the like where<br/>those concluding fifths are indeed &quot;bouncy.&quot;</p><p>In this epoch, we also encounter a minor third plus<br/>a fifth as a closing sonority, for example in<br/>Josquin, which in meantone would approximate<br/>10:12:15. One clue reinforcing the conclusion<br/>that raising the minor third to major as an<br/>implicit performance practice is _not_ necessarily<br/>meant is the advocacy of the Ab-C# meantone tuning<br/>by Ramos (1482, whose 5-limit JI monochord is<br/>distinct from his discussion of a practical<br/>keyobard, which Mark Lindley persuasively<br/>analyzes as a meantone instrument). If a<br/>closing third were meant to be major by<br/>unwritten alteration -- as will soon become<br/>true for the most part -- then G# would<br/>hardly be omissible for closes in the<br/>Third and Fourth Modes (E Phrygian with<br/>an authentic or plagal range). Yet Ramos<br/>considers it optional, and of lower<br/>priority than Ab, while Arnold Schlick<br/>(1511) describes an irregular temperament<br/>where Ab is acceptable but G# marginal,<br/>meant for an ornamental E-G# leading to<br/>a cadence on A, for example, rather than<br/>a fully harmonious E-G# as a closing<br/>major third.</p><p>By 1523, the date of Pietro Aron&apos;s<br/>first edition of the _Toscanello in<br/>Musica_, the &quot;otonal&quot; preference<br/>of which you speak does seem in<br/>place, at least in Aron&apos;s milieu:<br/>altering a minor third to major<br/>is seen as enhancing the beauty<br/>of the music. And in his treatise<br/>on the modes of 1525, Aron shows<br/>the alteration of closing thirds<br/>from minor to major, a typical<br/>alteration of the 16th and early<br/>17th centuries from this point on.<br/>Such a situation fits nicely with<br/>Eb-G# meantone, which supplies<br/>that E-G#-B sonority for Phrygian.</p><p>However, there still seems a<br/>feeling, which can sometimes<br/>hold to a degree even in the<br/>late 16th century when Zarlino&apos;s<br/>_harmonia perfetta_ based on<br/>the division of the 3:2 fifth<br/>into 4:5:6 (or better yet with<br/>a voicing &quot;in the order of<br/>the sonorous numbers&quot; like<br/>2:3:4:5, with the major tenth<br/>preferred to the simple third),<br/>that a close on a simple unison<br/>or octave in two-voice writing,<br/>or on 2:3:4 or 1:2:3:4 or the<br/>like in multi-voice writing,<br/>is somehow in a sense more<br/>&quot;conclusive&quot; or &quot;formal.&quot;<br/>This may occur in liturgical<br/>music, for example, but also<br/>in secular pieces such as<br/>certain madrigals.</p><p>By the 1550&apos;s, we have<br/>statements from Vicentino<br/>(1555) and Zarlino (1558)<br/>in favor of &quot;richness of<br/>harmony&quot; or &quot;perfect<br/>harmony&quot; including a<br/>third plus a fifth or<br/>sixth -- or their octave<br/>extensions -- wherever<br/>possible. And many final<br/>closes follow this<br/>axiom. However, the taste<br/>at times for an especially<br/>conclusive final sonority<br/>makes itself felt.</p><p>(In a Gothic setting, the<br/>same ideal of &quot;richness&quot;<br/>or &quot;perfection&quot; applies,<br/>but with 2:3:4 rather<br/>than 4:5:6 as the<br/>&quot;threefold perfection<br/>of harmony.&quot; They are<br/>the harmonic or otonal<br/>divisions of the octave<br/>and fifth respectively.)</p><p>Thus we move from the<br/>active and unstable thirds<br/>of the Gothic Era to the<br/>mixture of regular Pythagorean<br/>and schismatic thirds around<br/>the early 15th century, the<br/>adoption of meantone in the<br/>middle to later portion of<br/>the century, and the<br/>acceptance of thirds as<br/>conclusive by the early<br/>16th century, which seems<br/>to lead to the &quot;otonal&quot;<br/>preference expressed by<br/>some observations and<br/>examples of Aron in the<br/>1520&apos;s, and in a more<br/>developed way by Vicentino<br/>and Zarlino.</p><p>And this isn&apos;t a complete<br/>account, because we have<br/>accounts of English music<br/>in the 13th and early 14th<br/>centuries, as well as some<br/>surviving pieces including<br/>the famous _Sumer is icumen<br/>in_, which do point both<br/>to a treatment of thirds as<br/>&quot;the best concords,&quot; upon<br/>which one may end as well as<br/>begin, and to vocal tunings<br/>&quot;mollifying&quot; these thirds<br/>by performing them at or<br/>near 5/4 or 6/5 (as<br/>Christopher Page puts it).</p><p>Nor have I gotten into<br/>14th-century variations also<br/>discussed and advocated by<br/>Page where cadential major<br/>thirds and sixths tend to<br/>be considerably _wider_ than<br/>Pythagorean, something that<br/>may apply not only to<br/>Marchettus of Padua and his<br/>early 14th-century Italian<br/>style, but to lots of French<br/>music including that of Machaut<br/>(Page&apos;s view and also mine).</p><p>Anyway, Gene, your observations<br/>seem perceptive to me as far<br/>as Renaissance trends; and Carl,<br/>I much agree with your point<br/>that tuning a major third at<br/>81/64 (or 14/11 or 33/26) may<br/>itself signal a style where<br/>such thirds are regarded as<br/>&quot;_imperfect_ concords&quot; with<br/>lots of stress on the first<br/>word of that expression.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2010 12:42:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow, that&apos;s a keeper.

And by sometime<br/>&gt; around 1450, experimenting with such systems leads to meantone<br/>&gt; temperament making approximate 5/4 thirds the general norm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if we think of the early to middle of the 15th century<br/>&gt; as the early Renaissance, this transition ties in directly<br/>&gt; with your following comment, Gene.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; This is an interesting question, and I might nuance my language<br/>&gt; a bit to describe the situation in the young Dufay&apos;s epoch around<br/>&gt; 1420-1440, the situation around 1500, and the situation in the<br/>&gt; later 16th century (say Lasso or Palestrina).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the early and middle 15th century, while sonorities with thirds<br/>&gt; (and sixths) become more and pervasive, there&apos;s still the<br/>&gt; expectation that we&apos;ll eventually cadence on a trine or fifth.<br/>&gt; This expectation, which in many ways is coupled with directed<br/>&gt; progressions and organizational schemes not too different from<br/>&gt; &quot;classic&quot; ones of the 14th century (which I still find myself<br/>&gt; using in the 21st century), feels very basic to me in the<br/>&gt; appeal of many of Dufay&apos;s early chansons, fauxbourdon settings,<br/>&gt; and some Mass settings and motets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As things move on, and likely we are moving into the early<br/>&gt; meantone era of keyboard tuning in more and more places,<br/>&gt; sonorities with thirds are reaching a status of &quot;almost<br/>&gt; stable.&quot; In lots of the music of Busnois and Ockeghem,<br/>&gt; for example, I&apos;d still expect to hear a final sonority<br/>&gt; of 2:3:4 (or, with the wider spacing that becomes common,<br/>&gt; often 1:2:3:4 or the like), or maybe even a simple octave<br/>&gt; (common in some three-voice writing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Around 1500, say in a popular four-voice style like the<br/>&gt; Cancionero de Palacio in Spain, I&apos;d expect to hear<br/>&gt; a third-plus-fifth-or-sixth type of sonority (as Zarlino<br/>&gt; puts it later, in 1558) just about anywhere within a<br/>&gt; phrase, but with a final cadence on 2:3:4 or the like<br/>&gt; still very common and delightful -- yes, in keyboard<br/>&gt; performance, in 1/4-comma meantone or the like where<br/>&gt; those concluding fifths are indeed &quot;bouncy.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this epoch, we also encounter a minor third plus<br/>&gt; a fifth as a closing sonority, for example in<br/>&gt; Josquin, which in meantone would approximate<br/>&gt; 10:12:15. One clue reinforcing the conclusion<br/>&gt; that raising the minor third to major as an<br/>&gt; implicit performance practice is _not_ necessarily<br/>&gt; meant is the advocacy of the Ab-C# meantone tuning<br/>&gt; by Ramos (1482, whose 5-limit JI monochord is<br/>&gt; distinct from his discussion of a practical<br/>&gt; keyobard, which Mark Lindley persuasively<br/>&gt; analyzes as a meantone instrument). If a<br/>&gt; closing third were meant to be major by<br/>&gt; unwritten alteration -- as will soon become<br/>&gt; true for the most part -- then G# would<br/>&gt; hardly be omissible for closes in the<br/>&gt; Third and Fourth Modes (E Phrygian with<br/>&gt; an authentic or plagal range). Yet Ramos<br/>&gt; considers it optional, and of lower<br/>&gt; priority than Ab, while Arnold Schlick<br/>&gt; (1511) describes an irregular temperament<br/>&gt; where Ab is acceptable but G# marginal,<br/>&gt; meant for an ornamental E-G# leading to<br/>&gt; a cadence on A, for example, rather than<br/>&gt; a fully harmonious E-G# as a closing<br/>&gt; major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By 1523, the date of Pietro Aron&apos;s<br/>&gt; first edition of the _Toscanello in<br/>&gt; Musica_, the &quot;otonal&quot; preference<br/>&gt; of which you speak does seem in<br/>&gt; place, at least in Aron&apos;s milieu:<br/>&gt; altering a minor third to major<br/>&gt; is seen as enhancing the beauty<br/>&gt; of the music. And in his treatise<br/>&gt; on the modes of 1525, Aron shows<br/>&gt; the alteration of closing thirds<br/>&gt; from minor to major, a typical<br/>&gt; alteration of the 16th and early<br/>&gt; 17th centuries from this point on.<br/>&gt; Such a situation fits nicely with<br/>&gt; Eb-G# meantone, which supplies<br/>&gt; that E-G#-B sonority for Phrygian.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, there still seems a<br/>&gt; feeling, which can sometimes<br/>&gt; hold to a degree even in the<br/>&gt; late 16th century when Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; _harmonia perfetta_ based on<br/>&gt; the division of the 3:2 fifth<br/>&gt; into 4:5:6 (or better yet with<br/>&gt; a voicing &quot;in the order of<br/>&gt; the sonorous numbers&quot; like<br/>&gt; 2:3:4:5, with the major tenth<br/>&gt; preferred to the simple third),<br/>&gt; that a close on a simple unison<br/>&gt; or octave in two-voice writing,<br/>&gt; or on 2:3:4 or 1:2:3:4 or the<br/>&gt; like in multi-voice writing,<br/>&gt; is somehow in a sense more<br/>&gt; &quot;conclusive&quot; or &quot;formal.&quot;<br/>&gt; This may occur in liturgical<br/>&gt; music, for example, but also<br/>&gt; in secular pieces such as<br/>&gt; certain madrigals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the 1550&apos;s, we have<br/>&gt; statements from Vicentino<br/>&gt; (1555) and Zarlino (1558)<br/>&gt; in favor of &quot;richness of<br/>&gt; harmony&quot; or &quot;perfect<br/>&gt; harmony&quot; including a<br/>&gt; third plus a fifth or<br/>&gt; sixth -- or their octave<br/>&gt; extensions -- wherever<br/>&gt; possible. And many final<br/>&gt; closes follow this<br/>&gt; axiom. However, the taste<br/>&gt; at times for an especially<br/>&gt; conclusive final sonority<br/>&gt; makes itself felt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (In a Gothic setting, the<br/>&gt; same ideal of &quot;richness&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;perfection&quot; applies,<br/>&gt; but with 2:3:4 rather<br/>&gt; than 4:5:6 as the<br/>&gt; &quot;threefold perfection<br/>&gt; of harmony.&quot; They are<br/>&gt; the harmonic or otonal<br/>&gt; divisions of the octave<br/>&gt; and fifth respectively.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus we move from the<br/>&gt; active and unstable thirds<br/>&gt; of the Gothic Era to the<br/>&gt; mixture of regular Pythagorean<br/>&gt; and schismatic thirds around<br/>&gt; the early 15th century, the<br/>&gt; adoption of meantone in the<br/>&gt; middle to later portion of<br/>&gt; the century, and the<br/>&gt; acceptance of thirds as<br/>&gt; conclusive by the early<br/>&gt; 16th century, which seems<br/>&gt; to lead to the &quot;otonal&quot;<br/>&gt; preference expressed by<br/>&gt; some observations and<br/>&gt; examples of Aron in the<br/>&gt; 1520&apos;s, and in a more<br/>&gt; developed way by Vicentino<br/>&gt; and Zarlino.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this isn&apos;t a complete<br/>&gt; account, because we have<br/>&gt; accounts of English music<br/>&gt; in the 13th and early 14th<br/>&gt; centuries, as well as some<br/>&gt; surviving pieces including<br/>&gt; the famous _Sumer is icumen<br/>&gt; in_, which do point both<br/>&gt; to a treatment of thirds as<br/>&gt; &quot;the best concords,&quot; upon<br/>&gt; which one may end as well as<br/>&gt; begin, and to vocal tunings<br/>&gt; &quot;mollifying&quot; these thirds<br/>&gt; by performing them at or<br/>&gt; near 5/4 or 6/5 (as<br/>&gt; Christopher Page puts it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nor have I gotten into<br/>&gt; 14th-century variations also<br/>&gt; discussed and advocated by<br/>&gt; Page where cadential major<br/>&gt; thirds and sixths tend to<br/>&gt; be considerably _wider_ than<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, something that<br/>&gt; may apply not only to<br/>&gt; Marchettus of Padua and his<br/>&gt; early 14th-century Italian<br/>&gt; style, but to lots of French<br/>&gt; music including that of Machaut<br/>&gt; (Page&apos;s view and also mine).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, Gene, your observations<br/>&gt; seem perceptive to me as far<br/>&gt; as Renaissance trends; and Carl,<br/>&gt; I much agree with your point<br/>&gt; that tuning a major third at<br/>&gt; 81/64 (or 14/11 or 33/26) may<br/>&gt; itself signal a style where<br/>&gt; such thirds are regarded as<br/>&gt; &quot;_imperfect_ concords&quot; with<br/>&gt; lots of stress on the first<br/>&gt; word of that expression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2010 9:20:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 12:39 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can&apos;t use your personal views on &quot;pretty&quot; as the basis for a definition.

The fact also that<br/>your singers, alive in the 21st century, could also hear the major<br/>third as being &quot;wrong&quot; when placed within the context of a 13th<br/>century composition suggests also that it&apos;s not entirely cultural.<br/>Perhaps it has something to do with how ones cognitive facilities end<br/>up adapting, by the end of the composition, to process the information<br/>being presented.

Thus many restrictions of later music don&apos;t apply, while, as<br/>Doug Leedy has eloquently written as a lover of meantone, the sheer<br/>sonority of saturated 5-limit combinations is at center stage,<br/>often together with some of the most sensitive sophisticated<br/>contrapuntal writing of any age.</p><p>Certainly there _is_, especially starting around the 1520&apos;s, a<br/>recognition of the contrast or polarity between Zarlino&apos;s &quot;natural&quot;<br/>arrangements of a fifth, major third, and minor third, or an outer<br/>major or minor sixth plus a major or minor third and a perfect fourth<br/>(e.g. C-E-G, E-G-C, and also G-C-E in Zarlino&apos;s view despite the<br/>traditionally more cautious Renaissance treatment of the fourth), and<br/>the &quot;artificial&quot; arrangements (e.g. D-F-A, F-A-D, and A-D-F, the last<br/>of which Zarlino considers least consnnant). Note that while a theory<br/>of inversion is generally deemed to have been introduced in the early<br/>17th century (e.g. Johannes Lippius in his germinal works of 1610 and<br/>1612), Zarlino&apos;s theory entails the result that octave transposition<br/>of voices, in later terms &quot;inversion,&quot; will not alter the basic nature<br/>of a &quot;natural&quot; division (e.g. 4:5:6, 5:6:8, or 3:4:5) or an<br/>&quot;artificial&quot; one (e.g. 10:12:15, 12:15:20, 15:20:24).</p><p>Here I&apos;m using frequency rather than string ratios, but this is<br/>actually in line with Zarlino&apos;s concept of the &quot;sonorous numbers,&quot;<br/>since he takes the _senario_ or first six natural numbers, and<br/>determines from them the natural order 1:2:3:4:5:6, a construction<br/>thus synonymous with the 17th-century and later concept of the<br/>harmonic series.</p><p>As you say, while the &quot;harmonic&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; division with the major<br/>third below and the minor third above is regarded as more conclusive<br/>by around the 1520&apos;s, and definitely so by the era of Vicentino and<br/>Zarlino, the ideal within a piece is of variety and balance.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s general guideline is very apt: if you write a harmonic or<br/>natural division, tend to follow it with an arithmetic or artificial<br/>one, and vice versa.</p><p>This fits both with the nature of the twelve modes, which often<br/>encourage such an alternation, and also with the patterns of<br/>counterpoint and polyphony which promote this fluidity also.</p><p>For lots of 16th-century and early 17th-century music, I find that<br/>while something may sound to me quite routine, people listening from a<br/>later major/minor perspective may note &quot;the mixture of major and<br/>minor&quot; or remark on some &quot;modulation&quot; where I might perceive a usual<br/>internal cadence or the like.</p><p>Here I use the term &quot;modal&quot; freely, because the structure of the modes<br/>as textbook &quot;scales&quot; is only one factor, with routine inflections and<br/>especially the rules of vertical progressions playing an equally<br/>important role in shaping the polyphonic texture and procedures.</p><p>In part, the textbook forms of the modes do give a hint that a mixture<br/>of natural and artificial divisions (or in later terms major and minor<br/>triads) will be very common, in contrast to the often more one-sided<br/>qualities of later major/mionr tonality. Thus Dorian has a major sixth<br/>above the final, and Mixolydian a minor seventh; the often fluid<br/>nature of these degrees serves both melodic variety and the kind of<br/>harmonic alternation recommended by Zarlino.</p><p>Additionally, while cadences often involve motion of the bass by a<br/>fifth or a fourth (a common point with later tonality), motion within<br/>a phrase by seconds or thirds is also very common, with Tomas de<br/>Santa Maria (1557, published in 1565) offering as part of his treatise<br/>on improvising or composing for polyphonic instruments such as<br/>keyboards and lute a kind of guide to 16th-century harmony in four<br/>parts which highlights some of these patterns the bass may follow.<br/>These characteristic bass motions often promote Zarlino&apos;s ideal of<br/>alternating -- early and often -- between natural and artificial<br/>divisions as part of the routine and beguiling color of the music.</p><p>Thus one side of the reality which you are picking up is that pieces<br/>in modes with a major third above the final (Ionian, Mixolydian, and<br/>Lydian) have a lot more arithmetic divisions or minor triads than a<br/>later piece in major.</p><p>The other side of the coin is that pieces in modes with a minor third<br/>above the final (Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian) may have a lot more<br/>harmonic divisions or major triads than a later piece in minor, and<br/>here I&apos;m not speaking only of the close where a major third was deemed<br/>more conclusive.</p><p>&gt; By 1523, the date of Pietro Aron&apos;s<br/>&gt; first edition of the _Toscanello in<br/>&gt; Musica_, the &quot;otonal&quot; preference<br/>&gt; of which you speak does seem in<br/>&gt; place, at least in Aron&apos;s milieu:<br/>&gt; altering a minor third to major<br/>&gt; is seen as enhancing the beauty<br/>&gt; of the music.</p><p>&gt; I was referring to something I recall reading concerning what was<br/>&gt; said about the music; in terms of practice it seems to me<br/>&gt; Renaissance composers were very apt to use a lot of minor triads<br/>&gt; even in the later Renaissance, and more so earlier, where I suspect<br/>&gt; they may have been more common than major ones, as a minor feel to<br/>&gt; the music is so common. I wonder what a census of chords in the<br/>&gt; music of various composers would show?</p><p>The idea of a census might indeed be interesting! I can offer a few<br/>guesses as to what such a census might show, meant as an invitation to<br/>do it and see if my guesses are accurate (or maybe to do a bit of<br/>searching and learn that someone has done this kind of survey, and see<br/>what they found).</p><p>First, I should again confirm the importance of the very important<br/>distinction you&apos;ve made: to say that a major third is preferred in a<br/>closing sonority (if a third is present, as it is a very large<br/>percentage of the time although not invariably by the era of Zarlino)<br/>doesn&apos;t mean that the arithmetic division (or minor triad) isn&apos;t very<br/>much in demand for pieces in a range of modes!</p><p>Some of this can be subjective: a piece in the Dorian mode, for<br/>example (and some of this might apply to plainsong as well as 16th-century<br/>polyphony) might have a &quot;minor feel&quot; for many modern listeners where I<br/>might hear more of a balance or alternation of the divisions, and also<br/>focus on nuances like the often fluid sixth degree. However, I do<br/>think it is possible to note certain trends.</p><p>If we start around the later 15th century, where we get increasing<br/>tertian saturation, say the era of Ockeghem and Josquin, then indeed<br/>we often get a weighting toward the arithmetic division. I think of a<br/>piece like Ockeghem&apos;s _Missa Mi Mi_ in Phrygian, or maybe one of the<br/>chansons of the Netherlands school around 1500.</p><p>One sign of a certain direction in taste by the 1550&apos;s is Zarlino&apos;s<br/>advice that goes with his general guideline of alternating the<br/>harmonic and arithmetic divisions, so that one does not too long<br/>remain in either: if one must write several divisions of the same kind,<br/>it&apos;s better to stay in the harmonic division, since otherwise the<br/>music might become overly &quot;melancholy&quot; or &quot;languid&quot; or the like.<br/>It&apos;s expected that the quality of divisions will be influenced by the<br/>mode, one of the expressive dimensions that Zarlino addresses: but<br/>strive for variety and balance, and if in doubt, lean a bit toward the<br/>more &quot;natural&quot; harmonic division (in other words, the major triad).</p><p>While I haven&apos;t done a census, I would guess that if we survey some<br/>pieces in the Phrygian modes (authentic and plagal) around 1500, we<br/>might find a lot fewer sonorities of E-G#-B than around 1550 or 1600.<br/>I also seem to notice a tendency often to _open_ a piece with a major<br/>third, regardless of the mode.</p><p>Having emphasized the role of variety and alternation facilitated by<br/>the structure of the modes themselves but also wonderfully in line<br/>with the rules and patterns of counterpoint and harmony, I should add<br/>that around 1600 we sometimes encounter a kind of &quot;coloristic<br/>otonality&quot; which does not fit strictly within the framework of any<br/>mode, but indeed exemplifies the winning qualities of the era: smooth<br/>melodic movement, saturated 5-limit harmony, and contrary motion:</p><p>      E    F#   G<br/>      B    D    E<br/>      G#   A    C<br/>      E    D    C</p><p>Here we have three successive harmonic divisions, with the progression<br/>&quot;guided&quot; in part by what might be called classic 14th-century<br/>progressions: from the lower major third E-G# of the first sonority to<br/>the fifth D-A, and then from the major tenth D-F# between the outer<br/>voices of the second sonority to the 12th C-G. Of course, in this<br/>5-limit setting, the texture, color, and total effect are radically<br/>different! It&apos;s fascinating how Gothic two-voice progressions can<br/>influence smoothly flowing motion between 5-limit sonorities which has<br/>its own unique logic, distinct from the more &quot;directed&quot; ethos of<br/>either the Gothic or the 18th-century tonality.</p><p>We have indeed an abundance of harmonic divisions or &quot;major triads,&quot;<br/>but in a fashion quite different than a typical later major tonality!<br/>And although there is no direct chromaticism, the contrast between G#<br/>in the opening sonority and G in the third sonority is another characteristic touch.</p><p>More generally, I&apos;d certainly agree in guessing that around 1600, as<br/>well as around 1500, we&apos;ll find a lot more arithmetic divisions (minor<br/>triads) in modes having a major third above the final than we would in<br/>a later major tonality.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s advice on alternating the two diversions is a fine summary,<br/>and might be one starting point for looking at what&apos;s going on<br/>harmonically in the 16th century from its own perspective. Of course,<br/>that is always an ideal rather than a reality: the main difference is<br/>that lots of modern authors seem to apply 18th-century expectations,<br/>while I may indulge in some 14th-century expectations!</p><p>&gt;&gt; (In a Gothic setting, the<br/>&gt;&gt; same ideal of &quot;richness&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; or &quot;perfection&quot; applies,<br/>&gt;&gt; but with 2:3:4 rather<br/>&gt;&gt; than 4:5:6 as the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;threefold perfection<br/>&gt;&gt; of harmony.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Was that related to theology by any chance?</p><p>Definitely, at least for some of the most important theorists in this<br/>department. Thus Johannes de Grocheio around 1300 speaks of a<br/>trinitarian perfection in music, drawing a direct analogy with<br/>theology, in describing 2:3:4; while Johannes Lippius in 1610 and 1612<br/>does the same thing in describing 4:5:6 as the _trias harmonica_ or<br/>&quot;harmonic triad.&quot; For both Grocheio and Lippius, this recognition of<br/>an ideally concordant three-voice sonority is the key to intelligent<br/>compositional technique.</p><p>Not every reference is necessarily theological. Thus an anonymous<br/>author around 1300 very likely to be Jacobus of Liege (as I agree with<br/>the modern editor of this treatise) notes that in polyphony, one should<br/>follow a &quot;natural series&quot; of numbers 2-3-4 by composing the octave so<br/>that the 2:3 fifth comes before the 3:4 fourth. As in Zarlino&apos;s later<br/>theory of 5-limit sonority, this concept leads to results similar to<br/>those based on a harmonic series. Since a similar preference for 2:3:4<br/>as compared to 3:4:6 is also discussed at some length by Jacobus in<br/>his monumental _Speculum musicae_, although without specifically<br/>invoking the 2-3-4 series, his authorship of this smaller treatise<br/>indeed seems likely.</p><p>But Grocheio (or Grocheo) and Lippius were indeed very explicitly<br/>theological, and the latter had an influence on later German theorists<br/>including Werckmeister, for whom the _trias harmonica_ was a focus at<br/>once musical and mystical.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2010 3:00:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;ve been suggesting is that chords with a single<br/>&gt; dominant virtual fundamental are slightly more concordant<br/>&gt; than a general concordance rule would indicate IFF the<br/>&gt; lowest note in the chord is in the same pitch class as<br/>&gt; (music theory jargon for &quot;is an octave duplicate of&quot;) that<br/>&gt; virtual fundamental.  You can ask Paul if that accurately<br/>&gt; captures his idea.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are algorithms (e.g. Terhardt&apos;s) for calculating a<br/>&gt; chord&apos;s VF.  I don&apos;t have much experience with them.<br/>&gt; Harmonic entropy and Tenney height will be low if a chord<br/>&gt; has a single dominant VF.

How do you know that H.e. and Tenney height will be low if a chord has a single dominant VF?  Have VFs been calculated by other people for a variety of chords, sufficient to make a correlation?</p><p>&gt; Tenney height works for any size chord as long as the<br/>&gt; geomean doesn&apos;t exceed 10 or so.  See my plentiful recent<br/>&gt; examples.  It&apos;s fundamentally NOT a dyadic measure.</p><p>So how do you calculate Tenney height for a chord?  Do you put it in harmonic series terms (i.e. a minor chord would be 10:12:15) and then multiply all the harmonics (so the minor chord would be 1800)?  That can&apos;t be right.  That method would also rank 3:5:7 as more concordant than 4:5:6.  But I don&apos;t see how else it could be calculated for triads....</p><p>&gt; Harmonic entropy is also fundamentally NOT a dyadic measure,<br/>&gt; though to date only the dyadic version has been computed.<br/>&gt; In lieu of real higher-adic entropy values, Paul used average<br/>&gt; dyadic entropy of chords and scales in the thread Michael<br/>&gt; originally pointed to.  That was an expedient only, but the<br/>&gt; results were still interesting.</p><p>So basically, when I asked you what other property of a chord, beyond the concordance of its dyads, might be useful for determining the chord&apos;s concordance, and you asked, &quot;it&apos;s fit to a harmonic series&quot;, you were actually suggesting a property for which there is currently no established effective way to quantify.  H.e. has only been worked out for dyads, and Tenney height (assuming I&apos;ve understood its triadic version correctly) cannot effectively predict that a well-known concord like a minor chord should be concordant.  Are you assuming that &quot;fit to a harmonic series&quot; might be a good predictor just because utonal chords tend to be less concordant than otonal chords?</p><p>I wonder if there aren&apos;t maybe some utonal chords that are more concordant than their otonal counterparts?  I expected 1/(9:10:12) and 1/(16:18:21) to be more concordant, since the utonal versions both put a less complex interval closer to the lowest note, but oddly enough, I found the otonal versions still sounded more relaxed.  But still I wonder...if only there was a good way to calculate rootedness.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Oh, gosh.  I haven&apos;t exactly kept a record of every time<br/>&gt; &gt; some has used &quot;consonance&quot; to mean &quot;concordance&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I was just doing that, but I wasn&apos;t conflating the<br/>&gt; two concepts, I was trying to distinguish them!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generally you should know what you&apos;re talking about if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re going to accuse published scientists, or mailing<br/>&gt; list colleagues who may be reading, of doing something<br/>&gt; wrong.</p><p>Well, I didn&apos;t accuse anyone by name, because I didn&apos;t see the need to.  I figured that anyone for whom my accusation was valid would know I was talking to them, and anyone for whom it wasn&apos;t valid would know I was not talking to them.  If my accusation was completely baseless--if there is in fact no one here that considers &quot;concordance&quot; to be equivalent to &quot;consonance&quot;--I apologize.</p><p>&gt; Yes but also it&apos;s not terribly important.  The single<br/>&gt; parameter does a good enough job for musical purposes;</p><p>You really think so?  I may actually have to disagree.</p><p>What I&apos;m looking for is a good guide to finding the most concordant triads in any given tuning, and for tunings where there is no approximate 4:5:6 or 6:7:9, I haven&apos;t found a good guiding principle except my own ears.  Which is all fine and good for the purposes of my own music-making, but for the purposes of trying to explain to &quot;outsiders&quot; how to approach microtonal tunings, I feel like I need to be able to give some explanation.  Scales are easy, but harmony is a mess.  So far, I&apos;ve not seen any theory that reliably predicts the &quot;next most concordant thing&quot; to a 4:5:6 triad.  It sure isn&apos;t a 5:6:7, or a 3:5:7.

It only comes into its own in the case of tempered<br/>&gt; chords.  And if they&apos;re fairly accurate tempered chords, you<br/>&gt; can assume they have the concordance of the just chord they<br/>&gt; approximate.  I realize in your work with ETs you have often<br/>&gt; come across chords that don&apos;t fit this bill.

Harmonic entropy, by the way,<br/>&gt; *assumes this* from the start.</p><p>Obviously, since all utonal chords can be translated into otonal form with a significant increase in Tenney height.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I wonder if there aren&apos;t maybe some utonal chords that are<br/>&gt; &gt; more concordant than their otonal counterparts?  I expected<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/(9:10:12) and 1/(16:18:21) to be more concordant, since<br/>&gt; &gt; the utonal versions both put a less complex interval closer<br/>&gt; &gt; to the lowest note, but oddly enough, I found the otonal<br/>&gt; &gt; versions still sounded more relaxed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once you leave the regime of consecutive integer or odd<br/>&gt; harmonics, the otonal/utonal distinction ceases to be<br/>&gt; meaningful.  For instance, chords like 10:12:15:18 are<br/>&gt; their own inverses...</p><p>Yeah, I figured that out.</p><p>&gt; Odd limit will at least erase such distinctions, and lets<br/>&gt; you work along customary octave-equivalent lines.  e.g.<br/>&gt; 3:4:5 and 4:5:6 are equally concordant under odd limit vs.<br/>&gt; the former being more concordant under Tenney height.<br/>&gt; On the other hand, octave equivalence gives loony results<br/>&gt; beyond the 7-limit.</p><p>Ugh.  I feel like we&apos;ve come full circle.  It&apos;s amazing how we have all these measures of concordance, yet none is completely effective or consistent at describing and predicting the phenomenon of concordance...yet they are widely-used anyway.

On guitar, the major barre chord voicing is basically 2:3:4:5:6:8 (with the root on the low &apos;E&apos; string) or 2:3:4:5:6 (with the root on the &apos;A&apos; string.  However, the open-position G major chord is 4:5:6:8:10:16, and open-position C major (with the fifth in the bass) is 3:4:5:6:8:10.  Of course, it&apos;s pretty rare (except among acoustic/folk guitarists) to consistently use chords voiced like this.  Electric guitarists in most genres rarely use all 6 strings at once.  4:5:6:8 chords, or sometimes just 5:6:8 chords, are common when played on the high strings as &quot;partial&quot; barre chords.  Still, the 4:5:6 is often at the heart of the triad.  It&apos;s rare to drop the 4 or the 6.  It&apos;s also rare to put anything but the fundamental in the bass, though there is one voicing of a D major, usually used to transition from a G major to an E minor, that is voiced 5:6:8:12:16:20, but since it&apos;s 12-tET putting the third in the bass is pretty unstable (hence its use as a transition chord and not a final).</p><p>One wonders, though, if close-position triads wouldn&apos;t be more popular if we weren&apos;t using 12-tET.</p><p>Side note: I remember having trouble figuring out a few punk songs back in the day, because the guitarist used chords voiced 3:4:6:8, which created the illusion of a virtual 2 lower in pitch than the lowest-tuned string.  Putting the fifth in the bass like that is sometimes used to thicken the sound because of that phenomenon.</p><p>&gt; &gt; My lack of math skills precludes me being of much assistance<br/>&gt; &gt; in working it out, but I&apos;d be happy to nag Paul about it.  Has<br/>&gt; &gt; he changed e-mail addresses in the last five years?  Or is<br/>&gt; &gt; that one of his, the pun on &quot;polyester walrus&quot;, still current?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s current.</p><p>I&apos;ll drop him a line, then.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t this interpretation basically an admission that Tenney<br/>&gt; &gt; height can be discounted in certain circumstances, like when<br/>&gt; &gt; the dyadic roughness for some intervals in the chord are<br/>&gt; &gt; low enough?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul&apos;s approach led me to suggest that different subsets of<br/>&gt; a chord should compete, weighted by their Tenney height and<br/>&gt; the portion of the chord they &apos;explain&apos;.  For 10:12:15 for<br/>&gt; instance, we might have<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; interpretation -&gt; portion explained * 1/geomean = result<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2:3 -&gt; 2/3 * 1/sqrt(6) = 0.27<br/>&gt; 10:12:15 -&gt; 3/3 * 1/cubert(1800) = 0.08<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So 2:3 is the preferred interpretation.</p><p>Now this...this is interesting.  If a triad can be thought of as a sandwich, this suggests that as long as the bread makes a good enough &quot;fifth&quot;, that you should be able to get away with putting almost any sort of &quot;meat&quot; in the middle.  Even with a 4:5:6 chord, this formula puts the 3/2 above the full triad by about 0.07.</p><p>So then, shouldn&apos;t octaves be even stronger than fifths?  Looking at traditional &quot;power chords&quot; of 2:3:4, the octave takes up 0.47, while the whole triad is 0.35, suggesting that the 2/1 is the preferred interpretation.  It&apos;s a narrower lead, to be sure, but in other chords it would be much larger.  Maybe this also explains a phenomenon/&quot;rule&quot; I&apos;ve noticed in playing microtonal guitar: adding a 2/1 above the root makes any dyad more concordant.  In a tuning like 16-EDO, I use octave-doubling a LOT, making power-chords like ~4:5:8, ~4:7:8, and ~6:11:12...maybe the reason they work so well is that the octave is such a strong cue?</p><p>&gt; Human hearing is actually a pretty complex phenomenon.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not like calculating the orbit of the moon.

You can basically play BP in 19-EDO, too, if you don&apos;t mind the tempered 3/1, since 19-EDO gives an acceptable tuning of 3:5:7 and allows the same BP 9-note MOS scale.

And we all know what happened when people started messing around<br/>with the octatonic scale (was Stravinsky the first)?

The latter is certainly<br/>interesting, but the former is what epouses the xenharmonic ideal more<br/>strongly to me.</p><p>&gt; IOW, intonation is really just a way to evaluate the &quot;character&quot; of a tuning, telling whether it has a warbly active sound or a calm stable sound, or what chords in the tuning make you go &quot;ah&quot; and what chords make you go &quot;eh&quot; (and maybe even what chords make you go &quot;augh!&quot;, as the case may be).

If such<br/>was exactly the case, the novel habit in 1400s of tuning the black<br/>keys to flats in the fifths cycle to acquire the schismatic harmonic<br/>Majors on D, E and A would follow a desire to reflect the &quot;consonantia<br/>per accidens&quot; of singers on the keyboard, no?</p><p>Might I be brave enough to make the following conjecture?

This holds regardless of the fine points of tuning, just as<br/>&gt; a closing minor seventh would be out of place in Bach whether tuned<br/>&gt; 9/5, 16/9, or 7/4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we want to use typical 13th-14th century language, we can call<br/>&gt; thirds &quot;imperfect concords&quot; -- although some Italian authors refer<br/>&gt; to them at times as &quot;tolerable dissonances.&quot; Note that categories<br/>&gt; of this kind can also apply, especially in a 13th-century framework<br/>&gt; or a 14th-century one admitting lots of 13th-century liberties<br/>&gt; (e.g. Guillaume de Machaut) to things like 4:6:9, 9:12:16, 6:8:9,<br/>&gt; or 8:9:12 -- pleasing, and with a degree of blend, but definitely<br/>&gt; unstable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From personal experience, I can tell you that having some very<br/>&gt; well-meaning and skillful singers read a piece in 13th-century<br/>&gt; style from site and accidentally conclude a phrase with a major<br/>&gt; third and fifth above the lowest note where a stable fifth was<br/>&gt; intended sounds &quot;wrong&quot; -- whether this sonority was tuned<br/>&gt; 4:5:6, 0-400-700 cents, 64:81:96, or whatever (this was<br/>&gt; a capella, so lots of things were possible).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl, I much agree that tuning major thirds at 81/64 -- or often<br/>&gt; in my favorite neo-medieval temperaments somewhere around 14/11<br/>&gt; or 33/26, in a way a &quot;modern&quot; variation on Pythagorean -- fits<br/>&gt; nicely with the stylistic assumption that thirds are active<br/>&gt; and unstable intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, Gene, there is the interesting question of 5/4 in this<br/>&gt; kind of medieval Continental European setting, up to around 1400<br/>&gt; or so (you make an interesting observation on the following era<br/>&gt; which I&apos;ll address below).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One view is that it, or the almost identical Pythagorean<br/>&gt; diminished fourth at a schisma narrower (8192/6561), or 384.36<br/>&gt; cents, is in the same general category as other augmented or<br/>&gt; diminished intervals. This is the view of Johannes Boen in 1357,<br/>&gt; who considers such a diminished fourth, a comma narrow of a<br/>&gt; ditone at 81/64, as a &quot;consonance by situation&quot; (_consonantia<br/>&gt; per accidens_) if supported by a regular major third below,<br/>&gt; e.g. E-G#-C. The same rule applies to the augmented fourth with<br/>&gt; a minor third below, e.g. D-F-B. (Boen notes that the perfect<br/>&gt; fourth, likewise, becomes more concordant when supported by<br/>&gt; an appropriate interval below, here the fifth, e.g. D-A-D.<br/>&gt; While 2:3:4 can thus continue to be seen as an array of the<br/>&gt; three simplest and most concordant non-unisonal dyads not<br/>&gt; exceeding an octave, the fourth has a more problematic and<br/>&gt; debated status than in the 13th century, when it ranks<br/>&gt; with but after the fifth.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, one meets a similar kind of principle in Renaissance<br/>&gt; music where a diminished fourth might be around 32:25 (precisely<br/>&gt; so in 1/4-comma meantone): it is acceptable in certain<br/>&gt; circumstances, but most typically occurs between two upper voices<br/>&gt; both forming usual concords with the lowest voice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Around 1400 or so, we do have a shift, as written sharps are<br/>&gt; often tuned on keyboards as flats, so that schismatic thirds<br/>&gt; become the norm in certain positions, and contrast with usual<br/>&gt; Pythagorean thirds between diatonic steps. And by sometime<br/>&gt; around 1450, experimenting with such systems leads to meantone<br/>&gt; temperament making approximate 5/4 thirds the general norm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if we think of the early to middle of the 15th century<br/>&gt; as the early Renaissance, this transition ties in directly<br/>&gt; with your following comment, Gene.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;      Though in early Renaissance music I hear a marked tendency to<br/>&gt;&gt;      end on chords without thirds, which seems to disappear in the<br/>&gt;&gt;      later Renaissance. Whether that reflects a view that they<br/>&gt;&gt;      are still somehow dissonant, even though the<br/>&gt;&gt;      sweetness of the otonal thirds was admired, I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an interesting question, and I might nuance my language<br/>&gt; a bit to describe the situation in the young Dufay&apos;s epoch around<br/>&gt; 1420-1440, the situation around 1500, and the situation in the<br/>&gt; later 16th century (say Lasso or Palestrina).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the early and middle 15th century, while sonorities with thirds<br/>&gt; (and sixths) become more and pervasive, there&apos;s still the<br/>&gt; expectation that we&apos;ll eventually cadence on a trine or fifth.<br/>&gt; This expectation, which in many ways is coupled with directed<br/>&gt; progressions and organizational schemes not too different from<br/>&gt; &quot;classic&quot; ones of the 14th century (which I still find myself<br/>&gt; using in the 21st century), feels very basic to me in the<br/>&gt; appeal of many of Dufay&apos;s early chansons, fauxbourdon settings,<br/>&gt; and some Mass settings and motets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As things move on, and likely we are moving into the early<br/>&gt; meantone era of keyboard tuning in more and more places,<br/>&gt; sonorities with thirds are reaching a status of &quot;almost<br/>&gt; stable.&quot; In lots of the music of Busnois and Ockeghem,<br/>&gt; for example, I&apos;d still expect to hear a final sonority<br/>&gt; of 2:3:4 (or, with the wider spacing that becomes common,<br/>&gt; often 1:2:3:4 or the like), or maybe even a simple octave<br/>&gt; (common in some three-voice writing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Around 1500, say in a popular four-voice style like the<br/>&gt; Cancionero de Palacio in Spain, I&apos;d expect to hear<br/>&gt; a third-plus-fifth-or-sixth type of sonority (as Zarlino<br/>&gt; puts it later, in 1558) just about anywhere within a<br/>&gt; phrase, but with a final cadence on 2:3:4 or the like<br/>&gt; still very common and delightful -- yes, in keyboard<br/>&gt; performance, in 1/4-comma meantone or the like where<br/>&gt; those concluding fifths are indeed &quot;bouncy.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this epoch, we also encounter a minor third plus<br/>&gt; a fifth as a closing sonority, for example in<br/>&gt; Josquin, which in meantone would approximate<br/>&gt; 10:12:15. One clue reinforcing the conclusion<br/>&gt; that raising the minor third to major as an<br/>&gt; implicit performance practice is _not_ necessarily<br/>&gt; meant is the advocacy of the Ab-C# meantone tuning<br/>&gt; by Ramos (1482, whose 5-limit JI monochord is<br/>&gt; distinct from his discussion of a practical<br/>&gt; keyobard, which Mark Lindley persuasively<br/>&gt; analyzes as a meantone instrument). If a<br/>&gt; closing third were meant to be major by<br/>&gt; unwritten alteration -- as will soon become<br/>&gt; true for the most part -- then G# would<br/>&gt; hardly be omissible for closes in the<br/>&gt; Third and Fourth Modes (E Phrygian with<br/>&gt; an authentic or plagal range). Yet Ramos<br/>&gt; considers it optional, and of lower<br/>&gt; priority than Ab, while Arnold Schlick<br/>&gt; (1511) describes an irregular temperament<br/>&gt; where Ab is acceptable but G# marginal,<br/>&gt; meant for an ornamental E-G# leading to<br/>&gt; a cadence on A, for example, rather than<br/>&gt; a fully harmonious E-G# as a closing<br/>&gt; major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By 1523, the date of Pietro Aron&apos;s<br/>&gt; first edition of the _Toscanello in<br/>&gt; Musica_, the &quot;otonal&quot; preference<br/>&gt; of which you speak does seem in<br/>&gt; place, at least in Aron&apos;s milieu:<br/>&gt; altering a minor third to major<br/>&gt; is seen as enhancing the beauty<br/>&gt; of the music. And in his treatise<br/>&gt; on the modes of 1525, Aron shows<br/>&gt; the alteration of closing thirds<br/>&gt; from minor to major, a typical<br/>&gt; alteration of the 16th and early<br/>&gt; 17th centuries from this point on.<br/>&gt; Such a situation fits nicely with<br/>&gt; Eb-G# meantone, which supplies<br/>&gt; that E-G#-B sonority for Phrygian.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, there still seems a<br/>&gt; feeling, which can sometimes<br/>&gt; hold to a degree even in the<br/>&gt; late 16th century when Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; _harmonia perfetta_ based on<br/>&gt; the division of the 3:2 fifth<br/>&gt; into 4:5:6 (or better yet with<br/>&gt; a voicing &quot;in the order of<br/>&gt; the sonorous numbers&quot; like<br/>&gt; 2:3:4:5, with the major tenth<br/>&gt; preferred to the simple third),<br/>&gt; that a close on a simple unison<br/>&gt; or octave in two-voice writing,<br/>&gt; or on 2:3:4 or 1:2:3:4 or the<br/>&gt; like in multi-voice writing,<br/>&gt; is somehow in a sense more<br/>&gt; &quot;conclusive&quot; or &quot;formal.&quot;<br/>&gt; This may occur in liturgical<br/>&gt; music, for example, but also<br/>&gt; in secular pieces such as<br/>&gt; certain madrigals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the 1550&apos;s, we have<br/>&gt; statements from Vicentino<br/>&gt; (1555) and Zarlino (1558)<br/>&gt; in favor of &quot;richness of<br/>&gt; harmony&quot; or &quot;perfect<br/>&gt; harmony&quot; including a<br/>&gt; third plus a fifth or<br/>&gt; sixth -- or their octave<br/>&gt; extensions -- wherever<br/>&gt; possible. And many final<br/>&gt; closes follow this<br/>&gt; axiom. However, the taste<br/>&gt; at times for an especially<br/>&gt; conclusive final sonority<br/>&gt; makes itself felt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (In a Gothic setting, the<br/>&gt; same ideal of &quot;richness&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;perfection&quot; applies,<br/>&gt; but with 2:3:4 rather<br/>&gt; than 4:5:6 as the<br/>&gt; &quot;threefold perfection<br/>&gt; of harmony.&quot; They are<br/>&gt; the harmonic or otonal<br/>&gt; divisions of the octave<br/>&gt; and fifth respectively.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus we move from the<br/>&gt; active and unstable thirds<br/>&gt; of the Gothic Era to the<br/>&gt; mixture of regular Pythagorean<br/>&gt; and schismatic thirds around<br/>&gt; the early 15th century, the<br/>&gt; adoption of meantone in the<br/>&gt; middle to later portion of<br/>&gt; the century, and the<br/>&gt; acceptance of thirds as<br/>&gt; conclusive by the early<br/>&gt; 16th century, which seems<br/>&gt; to lead to the &quot;otonal&quot;<br/>&gt; preference expressed by<br/>&gt; some observations and<br/>&gt; examples of Aron in the<br/>&gt; 1520&apos;s, and in a more<br/>&gt; developed way by Vicentino<br/>&gt; and Zarlino.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this isn&apos;t a complete<br/>&gt; account, because we have<br/>&gt; accounts of English music<br/>&gt; in the 13th and early 14th<br/>&gt; centuries, as well as some<br/>&gt; surviving pieces including<br/>&gt; the famous _Sumer is icumen<br/>&gt; in_, which do point both<br/>&gt; to a treatment of thirds as<br/>&gt; &quot;the best concords,&quot; upon<br/>&gt; which one may end as well as<br/>&gt; begin, and to vocal tunings<br/>&gt; &quot;mollifying&quot; these thirds<br/>&gt; by performing them at or<br/>&gt; near 5/4 or 6/5 (as<br/>&gt; Christopher Page puts it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nor have I gotten into<br/>&gt; 14th-century variations also<br/>&gt; discussed and advocated by<br/>&gt; Page where cadential major<br/>&gt; thirds and sixths tend to<br/>&gt; be considerably _wider_ than<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, something that<br/>&gt; may apply not only to<br/>&gt; Marchettus of Padua and his<br/>&gt; early 14th-century Italian<br/>&gt; style, but to lots of French<br/>&gt; music including that of Machaut<br/>&gt; (Page&apos;s view and also mine).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, Gene, your observations<br/>&gt; seem perceptive to me as far<br/>&gt; as Renaissance trends; and Carl,<br/>&gt; I much agree with your point<br/>&gt; that tuning a major third at<br/>&gt; 81/64 (or 14/11 or 33/26) may<br/>&gt; itself signal a style where<br/>&gt; such thirds are regarded as<br/>&gt; &quot;_imperfect_ concords&quot; with<br/>&gt; lots of stress on the first<br/>&gt; word of that expression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

But the truth is that<br/>we still tend to fit even the JI major scale to our LLsLLLs diatonic<br/>template - set your keyboard to just-major and see how many times you<br/>accidentally hit that D-A wolf fifth because you think it should still<br/>be a perfect fifth, not some other interval.</p><p>That being said, the LMsLMLs template and LLsLLLs template are clearly<br/>very close to each other perceptually, and related in some way - I am<br/>not quite sure how yet. Hopefully after this 4th read of Rothenberg&apos;s<br/>paper I will have a better understanding of how maps work.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; The above would seem to work fine for pure MOS scales, but especially not scales with, say, 4+ different interval sizes.&nbsp; For example, what should I do if a scale I have has consecutive sizes of 1.09,1.095,1.11, 1.09, 1.12, and 1.11?</p><p>It is 3 in the morning, and I really don&apos;t want to do the math here.<br/>Can&apos;t you just convert that into cents or JI ratios or something? I<br/>don&apos;t have a cents value for 1.095 just memorized into my head.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;I keep repeating this example to show that multiple JI ratios can<br/>&gt; substitute for each other in the same map, but the map is what&apos;s<br/>&gt; important.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; Got it...but my point of confusion is how far do you have to go far as difference before you effectively &quot;have&quot; to change the map?</p><p>I don&apos;t know. What I have realized is that you can make the fifths for<br/>LLsLLLs as wide as you want, and until you get up to 5-equal it<br/>doesn&apos;t really make a difference. The fifths can also be as flat as<br/>you want, and until you get down to the fifth of 7-equal (where it all<br/>becomes one step) it still preserves the map structure. When you get<br/>the fifths flatter than 7-equal, it flips around and becomes ssLsssL,<br/>which is mavila[7]. And that is totally unrecognizable as a &quot;diatonic&quot;<br/>mode to my ears.</p><p>What is more interesting is mavila[5] vs meantone[5]. Both of them are<br/>ssLsL, but the mavila has the fifths so flat that 4 of them make 6/5<br/>instead of 5/4. This is definitely noticeable, but if you start<br/>playing with chord shapes and transposing them within the scale, the<br/>general &quot;pentatonic&quot; pattern still remains the same. I think the main<br/>difference between mavila[5] and meantone[5] is that you can hear<br/>meantone[5] as a subset of meantone[7] - that is, you can hear the<br/>major pentatonic scale as a subset of the major diatonic scale. But,<br/>the &quot;major&quot; pentatonic mavila scale is actually &quot;minor&quot; from a<br/>diatonic standpoint, because the thirds are 6/5. And hence mavila[5]<br/>is imbued with a bit of &quot;diatonic minorness.&quot;</p><p>But as I said, in 22-equal the augmented seconds are 5/4 and in<br/>31-equal they&apos;re 7/6... Makes not too much difference (unless you&apos;re<br/>looking for it). The main difference it makes is that the 22-equal<br/>harmonic minor scale is Rothenberg improper, which means that wide<br/>augmented second can have some interesting ambiguous properties.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;And remember my earlier example - the 22-equal superpyth harmonic<br/>&gt; minor scale. That augmented second is going to be a 5/4 (!) and the<br/>&gt; minor thirds will be 7/6.<br/>&gt; In 31-equal, the augmented seconds are 7/6 and the minor thirds are ~6/5.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh man am I confused here....it sounds like the interval classes not just slightly but completely overlap each other IE<br/>&gt; &quot;the minor thirds will be 7/6.&quot; (in 22TET)<br/>&gt; &quot;the minor thirds are ~6/5&quot; (in 31TET)<br/>&gt; &nbsp; How, pray tell, do I figure out what is in what class with this sort of overlap?</p><p>Right. So it all breaks down. You have a second that is bigger than a<br/>third, which makes the scale Rothenberg improper. But if you play C<br/>harmonic minor, you will note that it still definitely sounds just<br/>like harmonic minor.</p><p>Try lydian #2 as well. C D# E F# G A B C. You&apos;ll note that that C-D#<br/>is about 5/4. So you play C-D#, and your brain hears &quot;major third.&quot;<br/>And yet, as you keep playing the scale - C-D#-E-F#-G -- you will note<br/>that the whole thing gets &quot;reframed&quot; so that that C-D# dyad, which is<br/>an approximate 5/4, stops sounding like a C-E major third and starts<br/>sounding like a C-D# augmented second.</p><p>You might want to check out Rothenberg&apos;s paper... it&apos;s pretty intense,<br/>but very good. Has a bit of a classical slant to it (I didn&apos;t much<br/>care for his explanation of why &quot;only major and minor&quot; can be used,<br/>which was all over the place) but is very enlightening nonetheless.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2010 12:43:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Addressing Mike &amp; Michael in the same post:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;your map tells you how it&apos;s formed in terms of differing<br/>&gt; sizes of thirds - and how the notes can be grouped triadically, not<br/>&gt; just dyadically.&quot;<br/>&gt;   So, for example...Ls would be a major triad in that system and sL a minor one?</p><p>Sort of, if you take L to mean a major third and s to mean a minor third.

Consider that the mavila[7] lattice is the a reflection of the diatonic[7] lattice across the 3-limit line.  Tonality consists of the way each note is related to the others, the route you have to take to arrive back at the starting note.  Consider that if you just look at the 3-limit, the tiniest variance in the size of the fifth makes a huge difference in how far along the 3-limit line you have to go to get back to the tonic; but even a large variance in the size of the fifth doesn&apos;t change the two-dimensional vector that takes you back to the tonic on the 3,5 lattice.

But having a generator of a fifth ensures that a maximum number of chords in the scale will have a fifth; no other generator will produce more chords that have fifths.</p><p>&gt;    It seems obvious to me that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) The brain likes having the larger dyad first (IE major vs. minor)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) The brain seems to choke when it sees Just equal dyads stacked (IE 5/4 times<br/>&gt; 5/4)...perhaps because they point toward two different roots with almost<br/>&gt; absolute authority without putting the focus on one over the other.  This may<br/>&gt; also explain why 4-tone chords tend to sound best as LsL or sLs instead of Lss<br/>&gt; or ssL.</p><p>Ever try stacking 8/7&apos;s?  Of all the stacked dyads of equal size, I think this forms the nicest chords.  Especially if you temper them a little so that three of them spans a perfect fifth.  It&apos;s sort of like a compressed 5-EDO.  You can actually play 5 of them on top of each other, and it still sounds at least somewhat concordant.  I can&apos;t think of any other dyad that works better for this purpose.</p><p>&gt; 3) If anything(s) seem to help across the board...they are<br/>&gt;     A) Having a low number of intervals from each class possible (IE one type of<br/>&gt; third, fourth, etc. beats two type by a little and three by a whole lot)<br/>&gt;     B) Having most types of dyadic intervals be low limit (IE 80% or more in<br/>&gt; 7-odd-limit or less)</p><p>Your latter point seems less important to me.  If 12-tET has taught me anything, it&apos;s that you really need only ONE dyadic interval of low limit, so long as it&apos;s REALLY low limit.  Of course, there&apos;s nothing near the fifth in Tenney height--4/3 is the nearest, and it&apos;s twice as complex.  So if you drop having good fifths, I think you need at least two dyads of relatively-low limit.  Since you can&apos;t have 5/4 and 6/5 (or 7/6 and 9/7) without having good 3/2&apos;s, I&apos;d say 5/4 and 7/4 are good candidates.  Lemba temperament (I think?) gives 4 good 4:5:7 chords out of a 6-note MOS scale, which isn&apos;t too shabby.  This is one approach I&apos;ve used to good effect in 16-EDO (which has decent 5/4&apos;s and pretty good 7/4&apos;s, but terrible 3/2&apos;s).</p><p>This is, of course, from a strictly &quot;concordance&quot; point of view.  I&apos;m still not entirely certain whether a bad 4:5:6 sounds more or less resolved than a good 4:5:7.  I know I&apos;m accustomed to hearing a 4:5:(6):7 on the dominant chord resolve to a minor (10:12:15) tonic chord, as in an E major--&gt;A minor cadence, and the idea of trying to resolve to a 4:5:7 chord seems kind of absurd from a tonal standpoint.  But then again, that could just be my cultural/12-tET bias talking.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2010 12:53:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Aug 22, 2010 at 3:43 AM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike B. said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;I often wonder what about the diatonic scale that is the &quot;defining&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; factor to the brain in determining the overall sound produced.

You could just as well use 9/8, and 16/15 spanning a 6/5.  The map would look different, of course, but it would contain the same information.

We&apos;re<br/>used to hearing that interval as the root for major, and mixolydian,<br/>and aeolian dominant, and it being in the octatonic scale, that we<br/>have a generic &quot;schema&quot; built up for &quot;major third&quot; at this point. But<br/>consider the possibility that &quot;5/4&quot; isn&apos;t actually part of that<br/>schema... since 9/7 seems to substitute for it just fine. And our<br/>schema for &quot;augmented second&quot; seems to be even more flexible than<br/>major third, although perhaps that&apos;s just because we&apos;re used to<br/>thinking of an augmented second as the interval that&apos;s a diatonic<br/>semitone less than the major third, no matter how it&apos;s intoned.

IOW, the VII chord in C diatonic ionian is diminished (i.e. 3 minor thirds in a row), but in C mavila ionian, the VII chord is augmented (i.e. 3 major thirds in a row).</p><p>&gt; Right, I understand that. But note that in 22-EDO, a superpyth<br/>&gt; augmented second gets mapped to 5/4... And also notice that whether or<br/>&gt; not that major third is mapped to 5/4 or 16/13 doesn&apos;t seem to destroy<br/>&gt; the map, as in the case of 31-tet vs 26-tet.</p><p>The problem is, you&apos;re conflating two types of &quot;mapping&quot;.  Yes, you can take 22-EDO&apos;s superpyth to map 5/4 to an augmented second...but you don&apos;t *have to*.  You can take it to map 5/4 to a major third, just with a really high error.  IOW you can &quot;call&quot; the 9/7 third made by 4 fifths of 22-EDO a &quot;bad&quot; 5/4.  In fact, that is exactly what you are doing when you say that you &quot;hear&quot; 22-EDO diatonic as being the same as 31-EDO or 26-EDO diatonic.</p><p>The point being, you have to stop conflating the &quot;absolute&quot; JI ratio with the &quot;approximated&quot; JI ratio.  Just because the absolute JI ratio is closer to a 9/7 or a 16/13, that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not interpreted as an approximate 5/4.  At this point, it&apos;s a matter of harmonic entropy: 9/7 and 16/13 are near enough to the gravity-well of 5/4 to get &quot;sucked in&quot;.</p><p>Also, let me assure you that if you tried to use 22-EDO in a chromatic way, i.e. a 12-note MOS scale, it WOULDN&apos;T sound or work the same way that 31-EDO does, because while they have the same 7-note MOS, they have inverse 12-note MOS&apos;s (i.e. s&apos;s and L&apos;s switch places, as between diatonic and mavila).  Also, 26 and 31 diverge when you take a 19-note MOS.  So just as mavila and diatonic share the same 5-note MOS but not the same 7-note MOS, the various diatonic scales you&apos;re comparing share the same 7-note MOS but NOT the same higher-number MOS&apos;s.</p><p> &gt; What I think is going on is that when we hear a major third, we aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; really thinking of it in terms of any specific scale anymore. We&apos;re<br/>&gt; used to hearing that interval as the root for major, and mixolydian,<br/>&gt; and aeolian dominant, and it being in the octatonic scale, that we<br/>&gt; have a generic &quot;schema&quot; built up for &quot;major third&quot; at this point. But<br/>&gt; consider the possibility that &quot;5/4&quot; isn&apos;t actually part of that<br/>&gt; schema... since 9/7 seems to substitute for it just fine.</p><p>Again, this is probably more to do with harmonic entropy than anything else.  What makes 6/5 different is that it&apos;s its own local minimum of harmonic entropy, separated from 5/4 by the local maximum of 347 cents.  At 347 cents, as you&apos;ve noted on MMM, you can sound like major AND/OR minor at once, but slide away from it in either direction and you&apos;re either in major land or minor land.</p><p>&gt; And our<br/>&gt; schema for &quot;augmented second&quot; seems to be even more flexible than<br/>&gt; major third, although perhaps that&apos;s just because we&apos;re used to<br/>&gt; thinking of an augmented second as the interval that&apos;s a diatonic<br/>&gt; semitone less than the major third, no matter how it&apos;s intoned. Or, if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re into modern harmony, you&apos;re used to thinking of it as a major<br/>&gt; third above the major 7, a la C E F# B D#. And in 22-tet, both of<br/>&gt; those functions are fulfilled by 5/4, not 7/6.</p><p>You should compare some chromatic music in 22-EDO vs. 31-EDO and see if you still hear them as &quot;saying the same thing&quot;.  Augmented seconds sort of imply a 12-tone chromatic framework, or at least an addition to the lattice that makes one chord both a major and a minor.  In 22-EDO, if you want to &quot;map&quot; 5/4 to the augmented second, you have to use a very different lattice than the standard diatonic-7 lattice.  It no longer looks the same as 31-EDO&apos;s lattice.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I suppose in a sense, you *can* reduce it to one dimension--the generator--you just have to look at how x generators modulo the period relates back to 1 generator. With meantone, 4 fifths modulo an octave makes an interval that is more than half a fifth; in mavila, 4 generators modulo an octave makes an interval that is less than half a fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, I see. That is an interesting correlation. Why do you think that<br/>&gt; this might be the case - that it all gets related back to the<br/>&gt; generator?</p><p>Because these scales are all generated by a generator and a period (or I guess just &quot;two generators&quot; is the fashionable way to say it).  Each generator itself implies a unison vector (or vectors), which implies that two JI intervals (or more) are &quot;merged&quot; by the temperament.    So the generator itself actually tells us the entire mapping, presuming that we can read from it the commas that are tempered out of it.</p><p>Note that in meantone, if ONLY 81/80 is tempered out, then four 3/2&apos;s minus two 2/1&apos;s EXACTLY equals 5/4.  But scales like 12, 19, and 26 temper other commas out of the fifth as well, giving different results.  The commas &quot;fight&quot; with each other, you could say.  But all that information is encoded in the generators.  But in all meantones, four approximate 3/2&apos;s minus two exact 2/1&apos;s always approximates a 5/4.</p><p>The upshot is that you are free to interpret the word &quot;approximates&quot; however you please; if you can accept 9/7 as an &quot;approximate&quot; 5/4, you can call superpyth a meantone (though you&apos;ll be sharpening by a fraction of 81/80 instead of flattening).  As long as you stick to the 7-note MOS, you don&apos;t run into trouble...but when you extend the MOS far enough to get augmented seconds to appear, which are clearly better approximations to 5/4, you&apos;ll probably want to stop calling the 9/7 an approximation to 5/4, or else you&apos;ll have two intervals approximating one interval, which is sort of the opposite of tempering.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2010 1:05:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gamelismic tempering--tempering out 1029/1024.

That is what I&apos;m contesting. I think that there<br/>is something more fundamental that a major third &quot;is&quot; to us -<br/>something which isn&apos;t tied down to 5/4. Perhaps I&apos;m wrong, but<br/>consider my comments below.</p><p>&gt; The point being, you have to stop conflating the &quot;absolute&quot; JI ratio with the &quot;approximated&quot; JI ratio. Just because the absolute JI ratio is closer to a 9/7 or a 16/13, that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not interpreted as an approximate 5/4.

Compare the sound of 22-tet superpyth aeolian<br/>to 19-tet superpyth aeolian, and that still also &quot;works.&quot; And to my<br/>ears, at least, 7/6 and 6/5 are two different intervals.</p><p>But try an experiment - play a neutral third and you will notice that<br/>it will &quot;flip flop&quot; between a major third and a minor third. Is this<br/>because it&apos;s at an HE maximum between 5/4 and 6/5? Or is it that we<br/>can&apos;t figure out whether it fits better, literally, to a &quot;major third&quot;<br/>or a &quot;minor third&quot; in the diatonic sense? I will note that when I hear<br/>scales in which neutral thirds make their own kind of &quot;sense&quot; in some<br/>kind of new map - like the 7-tet example I posted on MMM, or like<br/>porcupine[7] where the minor 7 is almost 11/6, or with certain uses of<br/>mohajira, this no longer happens.</p><p>But to be honest, I thought the same thing as you for a while - that<br/>meaning was in fact tied down to JI ratios, and that I was just<br/>perceiving the 9/7 in 22-tet to be a mistuned 5/4. Seeing the minor<br/>thirds be 7/6 in aeolian, and having it all work the same, destroyed<br/>that hypothesis for me. You could make the argument that in superpyth,<br/>we just interpret the minor thirds as being 6/5 even though they&apos;re<br/>7/6 - but why would that be the case? You can clearly hear the triads<br/>switch from &quot;minor&quot; to &quot;subminor&quot; between 19-tet and 22-tet -- the<br/>whole mood changes. BUT, the &quot;function,&quot; or &quot;feeling,&quot; or &quot;meaning,&quot;<br/>or whatever really embodies the &quot;essence&quot; of what&apos;s going on doesn&apos;t<br/>change.</p><p>&gt; Also, let me assure you that if you tried to use 22-EDO in a chromatic way, i.e. a 12-note MOS scale, it WOULDN&apos;T sound or work the same way that 31-EDO does, because while they have the same 7-note MOS, they have inverse 12-note MOS&apos;s (i.e. s&apos;s and L&apos;s switch places, as between diatonic and mavila). Also, 26 and 31 diverge when you take a 19-note MOS. So just as mavila and diatonic share the same 5-note MOS but not the same 7-note MOS, the various diatonic scales you&apos;re comparing share the same 7-note MOS but NOT the same higher-number MOS&apos;s.</p><p>I haven&apos;t messed around with that - I will assume you&apos;re right. My<br/>approach to using meantone[12] is to use modes as chords, and write<br/>chord progressions where the mode keeps changing, and hence fleshing<br/>out a chunk of meantone[12] (maybe meantone[9] or something). So like<br/>||: Em7 | A7 | Dm7 | G7 :||, where it starts out in E dorian and moves<br/>to D dorian. Or you could have ||: Bmaj7/C# | Cmaj7 | Emaj/F# | Bmaj7<br/>:|| or something. Sorry I can&apos;t come up with anything sexier now, it&apos;s<br/>like 1 AM here, haha. I&apos;m beat.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to mess around with 22-EDO and see if modal harmonies are<br/>completely destroyed, haha. You have made a very good point, although<br/>I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m familiar enough with the 31-edo 12-note MOS to tell<br/>the difference... Perhaps this means I don&apos;t have a proper chromatic<br/>&quot;map&quot; to BE violated.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What I think is going on is that when we hear a major third, we aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; really thinking of it in terms of any specific scale anymore.

I<br/>actually had a conversation with Paul about this, and he was the one<br/>who pointed out to me that the effect of hearing a neutral triad flip<br/>flop might actually be the effect of trying to figure out what map it<br/>fits to, and have nothing to do at all with HE. Then he pointed out<br/>this 7/6 vs 6/5 superpyth example.

Please note that I don&apos;t actually have this all worked out, I&apos;m just sort of spinning hypotheses here as I go.  But this is getting kind of more long-winded than it should, so maybe we can splinter some of these ideas off into separate threads?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Right, but what about 7/6? 7/6 is not near enough to the gravity-well<br/>&gt; of 6/5 to get sucked in. Compare the sound of 22-tet superpyth aeolian<br/>&gt; to 19-tet superpyth aeolian, and that still also &quot;works.&quot; And to my<br/>&gt; ears, at least, 7/6 and 6/5 are two different intervals.</p><p>Well, the H.E. curve is much flatter between 6/5 and 7/6 than it is between 6/5 and 5/4.  Below 6/5, it seems like the transition between &quot;minor third&quot; and &quot;major second&quot; is a very smooth one, without a significant peak of &quot;what the hell IS that interval?&quot;.  IOW, that whole region is already pretty high in discordance.  Using the &quot;adjusted and inverted scale&quot; of H.E. that Steve M. just helped me work out, where a unison is 100 and a 51-cent quartertone is 0 (and an octave is 85, a fifth 50, etc.), 7/6 is about 23.74, 6/5 is about 25.91, and the &quot;dip&quot; between them is about 22.24 at about 288 cents.  So the difference between local maxima and minima of H.E. in that region is very slight.  OTOH, 5/4 scores about 30.3, and the valley (or peak, with the original H.E. numbers) between that and 6/5 is 18.73 at 350 cents; much more significant.</p><p>But at any rate, none of this may actually matter, and what may be more important--as I&apos;ve tried to suggest--is that when you bring it back to a question of generators, in the diatonic range it&apos;s always going to be the case that (4g-2p)&gt;(-3g+2p), whereas in Mavila, (4g-2p)&lt;(-3g+2p).  At 7-EDO, (4g-2p)=(-3g+2p).  At 5-EDO, (4g-2p)=(-1g+1p), and (-3g+2p)=(2g-1p).  As long as you can distinguish 4g-2p from -1g+1p, it doesn&apos;t matter what the exact ratio is.  However, in order to know whether you can distinguish between two intervals, you have to look at harmonic entropy, which drags JI back into the equation.</p><p>&gt; But try an experiment - play a neutral third and you will notice that<br/>&gt; it will &quot;flip flop&quot; between a major third and a minor third. Is this<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s at an HE maximum between 5/4 and 6/5? Or is it that we<br/>&gt; can&apos;t figure out whether it fits better, literally, to a &quot;major third&quot;<br/>&gt; or a &quot;minor third&quot; in the diatonic sense? I will note that when I hear<br/>&gt; scales in which neutral thirds make their own kind of &quot;sense&quot; in some<br/>&gt; kind of new map - like the 7-tet example I posted on MMM, or like<br/>&gt; porcupine[7] where the minor 7 is almost 11/6, or with certain uses of<br/>&gt; mohajira, this no longer happens.</p><p>The thing that really hammers me about neutrals is that I&apos;ve never found a good way to map them on a lattice, except as BOTH major and minor thirds.  I have to say, I don&apos;t like doing it that way, but it sort of makes sense.  I really think that with 7-EDO, there are multiple maps coinciding at once, and with the right chord progressions and melodic phrasing, you can suggest different maps.</p><p>Mohajira, OTOH, has a unique map that is different from 7-EDO.  Unlike 7-EDO, thirds other than neutral will appear in Mohajira, and they can remove the ambiguity of the mapping.  However, mapping Mohajira using thirds and fifths isn&apos;t the best way to do it; I use major 2nds and neutral 2nds to span one neutral third; this gives a lattice in the same shape as the diatonic scale, actually, just with letters in different places.</p><p>&gt; But to be honest, I thought the same thing as you for a while - that<br/>&gt; meaning was in fact tied down to JI ratios, and that I was just<br/>&gt; perceiving the 9/7 in 22-tet to be a mistuned 5/4. Seeing the minor<br/>&gt; thirds be 7/6 in aeolian, and having it all work the same, destroyed<br/>&gt; that hypothesis for me. You could make the argument that in superpyth,<br/>&gt; we just interpret the minor thirds as being 6/5 even though they&apos;re<br/>&gt; 7/6 - but why would that be the case? You can clearly hear the triads<br/>&gt; switch from &quot;minor&quot; to &quot;subminor&quot; between 19-tet and 22-tet -- the<br/>&gt; whole mood changes. BUT, the &quot;function,&quot; or &quot;feeling,&quot; or &quot;meaning,&quot;<br/>&gt; or whatever really embodies the &quot;essence&quot; of what&apos;s going on doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; change.</p><p>5/4 and 6/5 are only important in the diatonic scale because they are psychoacoustically as far as possible from each other AND from 4/3 (which is -1g+1p) and 9/8 (which is 2g-1p).  It is their psychoacoustic spacing that matters, not so much their actual low harmonic entropy.  This is what makes them ideal.  12-tET could be another sort of ideal, since the space between 200, 300, 400, and 500 cents is all equal and as wide as possible.  But the point is that the spacing doesn&apos;t HAVE to be ideal, it just has to be enough for us to tell the difference.  As long as the minor third is above the entropic peak around 240 cents, and the major third is below the entropic peak around 453 cents, we can get a recognizable diatonic scale.</p><p>Of course, I actually have no idea how to deal with the approaching-7-EDO-case; how close can the thirds get together before we stop being able to tell them apart?  That interests me a bit more than seeing how wide we can make the thirds.</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t messed around with that - I will assume you&apos;re right. My<br/>&gt; approach to using meantone[12] is to use modes as chords, and write<br/>&gt; chord progressions where the mode keeps changing, and hence fleshing<br/>&gt; out a chunk of meantone[12] (maybe meantone[9] or something). So like<br/>&gt; ||: Em7 | A7 | Dm7 | G7 :||, where it starts out in E dorian and moves<br/>&gt; to D dorian. Or you could have ||: Bmaj7/C# | Cmaj7 | Emaj/F# | Bmaj7<br/>&gt; :|| or something. Sorry I can&apos;t come up with anything sexier now, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; like 1 AM here, haha. I&apos;m beat.</p><p>Just carry the circle of fifths out to 12 iterations in both 17-EDO and 19-EDO, and compare the pitches you end up with.</p><p>&gt; Right, but I&apos;m not entirely sure that this is HE at work here. I<br/>&gt; actually had a conversation with Paul about this, and he was the one<br/>&gt; who pointed out to me that the effect of hearing a neutral triad flip<br/>&gt; flop might actually be the effect of trying to figure out what map it<br/>&gt; fits to, and have nothing to do at all with HE. Then he pointed out<br/>&gt; this 7/6 vs 6/5 superpyth example. And suddenly I&apos;m in a situation<br/>&gt; where the guy who invented HE is giving me examples to counter what<br/>&gt; I&apos;d been using HE to do this whole time.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;m not certain I interpret H.E. to mean the same things that everyone else does.  I&apos;m not sure if that means I&apos;m wrong, or if I&apos;m just seeing something new in it.  I&apos;ll have to quiz Paul on this myself, I suppose.  FWIW, I don&apos;t hear neutral thirds &quot;flip flop&quot; until I start playing chord progressions with them.  If I just sit and listen to a neutral third sustaining, it&apos;s got it&apos;s own unique character to me.  I hear it as sounding &quot;disappointed&quot;, or maybe &quot;reluctant&quot;.  It expresses something quite different than either a major or minor, but it loses that effect the minute I start playing a I-IV-V or something.</p><p>I strongly believe that to understand why certain scale-families have defining characteristics, we have to look at both the MOS structure AND the relationship of the generator and period (and their multiples) to JI.  To sum up (hopefully more understandably) what I tried to say above: a scale family is defined by the relationship that different multiples of the generator, modulo the period, have to each other pitch-wise.</p><p>For all I know, I&apos;m coming at this all bass-ackwards, though.  I&apos;ll bet looking at commas might be more revealing.</p><p>&gt; I think I&apos;m starting to finally understand what HE models, from a<br/>&gt; perceptual standpoint... it just models how resonant, or periodic, or<br/>&gt; harmonic a dyad or triad is. But there is something totally different<br/>&gt; going on with the map here.</p><p>Concordance is strongly correlated to intervallic identity. The closer an interval is to something you can tune by ear, the easier it is to identify.  The further an interval is between two tunable-by-ear intervals, the harder.  Intervals like the neutral third are about as far from two easily-identifiable intervals as possible, so they are hard to identify.  So there is that component to it....</p><p>&gt; &gt; You should compare some chromatic music in 22-EDO vs. 31-EDO and see if you still hear them as &quot;saying the same thing&quot;. Augmented seconds sort of imply a 12-tone chromatic framework, or at least an addition to the lattice that makes one chord both a major and a minor. In 22-EDO, if you want to &quot;map&quot; 5/4 to the augmented second, you have to use a very different lattice than the standard diatonic-7 lattice. It no longer looks the same as 31-EDO&apos;s lattice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In what way? If your axes are 3/2 and 9/7, and you temper out whatever<br/>&gt; the difference is between 9/7*3/2*9/7 and 5/2 - how would that be any<br/>&gt; different of a lattice between making the axes 3/2 and 5/4 and<br/>&gt; tempering out 225/224?</p><p>It&apos;s the difference between the 31-EDO and 22-EDO diatonic[12] I was talking about earlier.  An augmented 2nd is 9g-5p; in 22-EDO, this is higher in pitch than -3g+2p, while in 31-EDO, it is lower.</p><p>&gt; OK, but why do you think that it is of particular psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; significance how each interval matches up to the size of the<br/>&gt; generator? Note that in meantone the generators can be taken to be a<br/>&gt; tempered 3/2 and 2/1, or they can also be taken to be an approximate<br/>&gt; 16/15 and something between 9/8 and 10/9...</p><p>It&apos;s like holograms.  Anything that can generate a meantone scale contains within it all the information of the entire scale.  I&apos;m not familiar with using major and minor seconds to generate a meantone, though...how does that work?  Are you talking about treating meantone as a rank-3 temperament?  I don&apos;t see how you could use a major second and a minor second as sole inputs to an MOS algorithm and come out with a diatonic scale.  One has to be the modulo.</p><p>&gt; I do agree that 9/7 can be used to approximate 5/4... I&apos;m not so<br/>&gt; certain that 7/6 is stuck as a type of 6/5 though. They approximate<br/>&gt; different fundamentals.</p><p>Again, in the case of minor thirds, I&apos;m not sure any interval in that pitch-range is significantly stronger than its neighbors such that it stands out enough to be the musico-semantic ideal.  7/6 is so close to 6/5 in both pitch and complexity that there&apos;s practically a plateau between them, entropically-speaking.  Neither one is a &quot;type&quot; of the other; the whole minor third class is just sort of indistinct.  There&apos;s certainly no point of distinct ambiguity between them.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2010 10:01:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan wrote:</p><p>&gt; With little knowledge on the matter, I&apos;d like to ask Margo: Was it<br/>&gt; not that Halberstadt keyboard organs in 1300s were ordinarily tuned<br/>&gt; in such a way that the naturals bore Pythagorean pitches and the<br/>&gt; accidentals (black keys) were tuned midway of the wholetones? If<br/>&gt; such was exactly the case, the novel habit in 1400s of tuning the<br/>&gt; black keys to flats in the fifths cycle to acquire the schismatic<br/>&gt; harmonic Majors on D, E and A would follow a desire to reflect the<br/>&gt; &quot;consonantia per accidens&quot; of singers on the keyboard, no?</p><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Scholars such as Mark Lindley have suggested, very reasonably in my<br/>view, that the Halberstadt organs of Continental Europe in the 1300&apos;s<br/>often used a regular Pythagorean tuning of Eb-G#, with all naturals at<br/>accidentals at their usual Pythagorean pitches.</p><p>As Lindley observes, the Robertsbridge Codex, a collection of dances<br/>and other instrumental pieces dating somewhere around 1325-1365, calls<br/>for all 12 notes on a Halberstadt keyboard, and nicely fits Eb-G#,<br/>with most other choices raising lots of problems.</p><p>For 14th-century singers like Marchettus of Padua, who wasn&apos;t writing<br/>about keyboards but favored placing cadential sharps notably _higher_<br/>than their regular Pythagorean positions, the Eb-G# tuning would<br/>likely be preferable to an early 15th=century tuning where some or all<br/>of those sharps would be lowered by a comma from their usual pitches.</p><p>The fact that Johannes Boen in 1357 describes a Pythagorean diminished<br/>fourth like G#-C as dissonant in itself but a _consonantia per<br/>accidens_ in the special sonority of E-G#-C may be a clue that singers<br/>and keybaordists alike on the Continent did not yet favor the kind of<br/>schismatic tuning that caught on by around 1400-1420. In E-G#-C, the<br/>upper voices form regular intervals of a major third and minor sixth<br/>with the lowest voice. It may be notable that Boen does not recommend<br/>something like C#-F-G# or B-Eb-F# at an approximate 4:5:6.</p><p>Whatever the interplay between the tastes of singers and keyboard<br/>players, by 1400-1420 the schismatic tunings had come into vogue. Lindley suggests that around 1420-1430, the young Dufay was much<br/>influenced in his vocal music by the Gb-B tuning, favoring prolonged<br/>sonorities such as D-Gb-A (written D-F#-A) or A-Db-E (written A-C#-E).<br/>And by 1450-1480, the desire to have these smoother thirds in as many<br/>locations as possible evidently led to meantone temperament.</p><p>&gt; Might I be brave enough to make the following conjecture? Could it<br/>&gt; be possible that the transition from Pythagorean to Meantone was not<br/>&gt; as swift as generally assumed and spanned as considerable a time as<br/>&gt; it took 12-tone Equal-Temperament to arise from Meantone? And in<br/>&gt; such a manner that the trend was far from universal in every corner<br/>&gt; of Europe? (attested by examples such as &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot;?)</p><p>Here I should clarify that the above remarks are about Continental<br/>European music, and the English _Sumer is icumen in_ is a fine example<br/>of how thirds were treated as pervasive and sometimes stable concords<br/>in some English styles at least as early as the 13th century. Whether<br/>or how medieval English keyboards may have been tuned to fit such<br/>vocal styles remains an open question. It&apos;s easy to imagine either a<br/>schismatic Pythagorean tuning or meantone catching on under such<br/>conditions, but we don&apos;t have much evidence.</p><p>Curiously, an English manuscript from around 1275 -- tha age of Safi<br/>al-Din al-Urmavi -- describes a full 17-note Pythagorean division of<br/>the monochord! If one wanted to acquire lots of schismatic thirds,<br/>this would be a way to do it!</p><p>In 1373, a treatise on the organ advocates using a pipe length for an<br/>accidental which is the average or arithmetic mean of the two adjacent<br/>pipes at the 9:8 tone it divides into two semitones. For example:</p><p>      18    17   16<br/>       C    C#    D<br/>      1/1  18/17 9/8<br/>       0    99   204</p><p>This arrangement, like a schismatic tuning, would produce thirds<br/>involving accidentals which are closer to 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>While I might guess that meantone had come into vogue in England at<br/>around the same era of 1450-1500 are on the Continent, the first<br/>theoretical evidence of which I know is a statement by Thomas Morley<br/>in 1597 that on keyboards, G# would be too low to serve as Ab. so that<br/>keybaords called _chromatica_ have both. The nature of 16th-century<br/>English music, for keyboard or otherwise, suggests to me that meantone<br/>may have been in use for a century or more by the time Morley came to<br/>give us this theoretical hint as to its presence.</p><p>A fine point is that 12-EDO may have actually developed as a lute<br/>tuning in the early to middle 15th century as a variation on<br/>Pythagorean tuning permitting the use of the same fret as either a<br/>diatonic or chromatic semitone, in an age when a Pythagorean tuning on<br/>keyboard was still widespread.</p><p>Your comment, of course, focuses on the question of 12-EDO for<br/>keyboards in later eras when meantone or unequal well-temperaments<br/>were the norm.  In the 1580&apos;s, we hear a few opinions that it would be<br/>convenient if keyboards could be tuned to match the 12-EDO common on<br/>lutes; while in 1643, Jean Denis replies that it would be much better<br/>if lutes were improved by being tuned in a proper meantone (as had<br/>sometimes been done in the earlier 16th century, but with 12-EDO as<br/>the theoretical norm starting around the mid-16th century despite some<br/>interesting irregular tunings such as that of Dowland around 1600).</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2010 4:32:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Andy,</p><p>Thanks for all of this.

If<br/>&gt;&gt; such was exactly the case, the novel habit in 1400s of tuning the<br/>&gt;&gt; black keys to flats in the fifths cycle to acquire the schismatic<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic Majors on D, E and A would follow a desire to reflect the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;consonantia per accidens&quot; of singers on the keyboard, no?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Ozan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scholars such as Mark Lindley have suggested, very reasonably in my<br/>&gt; view, that the Halberstadt organs of Continental Europe in the 1300&apos;s<br/>&gt; often used a regular Pythagorean tuning of Eb-G#, with all naturals at<br/>&gt; accidentals at their usual Pythagorean pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Lindley observes, the Robertsbridge Codex, a collection of dances<br/>&gt; and other instrumental pieces dating somewhere around 1325-1365, calls<br/>&gt; for all 12 notes on a Halberstadt keyboard, and nicely fits Eb-G#,<br/>&gt; with most other choices raising lots of problems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For 14th-century singers like Marchettus of Padua, who wasn&apos;t writing<br/>&gt; about keyboards but favored placing cadential sharps notably _higher_<br/>&gt; than their regular Pythagorean positions, the Eb-G# tuning would<br/>&gt; likely be preferable to an early 15th=century tuning where some or all<br/>&gt; of those sharps would be lowered by a comma from their usual pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fact that Johannes Boen in 1357 describes a Pythagorean diminished<br/>&gt; fourth like G#-C as dissonant in itself but a _consonantia per<br/>&gt; accidens_ in the special sonority of E-G#-C may be a clue that singers<br/>&gt; and keybaordists alike on the Continent did not yet favor the kind of<br/>&gt; schismatic tuning that caught on by around 1400-1420. In E-G#-C, the<br/>&gt; upper voices form regular intervals of a major third and minor sixth<br/>&gt; with the lowest voice. It may be notable that Boen does not recommend<br/>&gt; something like C#-F-G# or B-Eb-F# at an approximate 4:5:6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whatever the interplay between the tastes of singers and keyboard<br/>&gt; players, by 1400-1420 the schismatic tunings had come into vogue.<br/>&gt; Lindley suggests that around 1420-1430, the young Dufay was much<br/>&gt; influenced in his vocal music by the Gb-B tuning, favoring prolonged<br/>&gt; sonorities such as D-Gb-A (written D-F#-A) or A-Db-E (written A-C#-E).<br/>&gt; And by 1450-1480, the desire to have these smoother thirds in as many<br/>&gt; locations as possible evidently led to meantone temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Might I be brave enough to make the following conjecture? Could it<br/>&gt;&gt; be possible that the transition from Pythagorean to Meantone was not<br/>&gt;&gt; as swift as generally assumed and spanned as considerable a time as<br/>&gt;&gt; it took 12-tone Equal-Temperament to arise from Meantone? And in<br/>&gt;&gt; such a manner that the trend was far from universal in every corner<br/>&gt;&gt; of Europe? (attested by examples such as &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot;?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I should clarify that the above remarks are about Continental<br/>&gt; European music, and the English _Sumer is icumen in_ is a fine example<br/>&gt; of how thirds were treated as pervasive and sometimes stable concords<br/>&gt; in some English styles at least as early as the 13th century. Whether<br/>&gt; or how medieval English keyboards may have been tuned to fit such<br/>&gt; vocal styles remains an open question. It&apos;s easy to imagine either a<br/>&gt; schismatic Pythagorean tuning or meantone catching on under such<br/>&gt; conditions, but we don&apos;t have much evidence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, an English manuscript from around 1275 -- tha age of Safi<br/>&gt; al-Din al-Urmavi -- describes a full 17-note Pythagorean division of<br/>&gt; the monochord! If one wanted to acquire lots of schismatic thirds,<br/>&gt; this would be a way to do it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 1373, a treatise on the organ advocates using a pipe length for an<br/>&gt; accidental which is the average or arithmetic mean of the two adjacent<br/>&gt; pipes at the 9:8 tone it divides into two semitones. For example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       18    17   16<br/>&gt;        C    C#    D<br/>&gt;       1/1  18/17 9/8<br/>&gt;        0    99   204<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This arrangement, like a schismatic tuning, would produce thirds<br/>&gt; involving accidentals which are closer to 5:4 and 6:5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I might guess that meantone had come into vogue in England at<br/>&gt; around the same era of 1450-1500 are on the Continent, the first<br/>&gt; theoretical evidence of which I know is a statement by Thomas Morley<br/>&gt; in 1597 that on keyboards, G# would be too low to serve as Ab. so that<br/>&gt; keybaords called _chromatica_ have both. The nature of 16th-century<br/>&gt; English music, for keyboard or otherwise, suggests to me that meantone<br/>&gt; may have been in use for a century or more by the time Morley came to<br/>&gt; give us this theoretical hint as to its presence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A fine point is that 12-EDO may have actually developed as a lute<br/>&gt; tuning in the early to middle 15th century as a variation on<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning permitting the use of the same fret as either a<br/>&gt; diatonic or chromatic semitone, in an age when a Pythagorean tuning on<br/>&gt; keyboard was still widespread.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your comment, of course, focuses on the question of 12-EDO for<br/>&gt; keyboards in later eras when meantone or unequal well-temperaments<br/>&gt; were the norm.  In the 1580&apos;s, we hear a few opinions that it would be<br/>&gt; convenient if keyboards could be tuned to match the 12-EDO common on<br/>&gt; lutes; while in 1643, Jean Denis replies that it would be much better<br/>&gt; if lutes were improved by being tuned in a proper meantone (as had<br/>&gt; sometimes been done in the earlier 16th century, but with 12-EDO as<br/>&gt; the theoretical norm starting around the mid-16th century despite some<br/>&gt; interesting irregular tunings such as that of Dowland around 1600).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
