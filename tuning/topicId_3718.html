A major third of 9/7 is larger even than the Pythagorean 81/64,<br/>&gt;&gt;which is itself larger than ET12. They would be good as D# and A#,<br/>&gt;&gt;though even then the major third from B to D# is flatter than just.</p><p>I figure that if a scale has these particular two black notes then they<br/>are normally called flats.  They are as you say very flat flats.  In his<br/>book on Indian music Clements has a lovely notation where the flat looks<br/>like a vertical line with a seven written through it (which also<br/>symbolizes the 7 ratio).

The third triad does not have a note at * as this<br/>would be very close to F (63/64) and Paul&apos;s comment indicates that the D<br/>is not at $ (which would be 80/81 of the D shown), however it is just<br/>with G and B.</p><p>If these intervals were attempted to be closed then it would be some<br/>sort of meantone tuning and not a purely just scale based on exact<br/>harmonics.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
