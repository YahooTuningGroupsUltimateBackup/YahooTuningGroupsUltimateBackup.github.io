If you are interested in scientific<br/>&gt;approaches, start with Hall&apos;s _Musical Acoustics_ (there are a few chapters<br/>&gt;on psychoacoustics and tuning) and follow the references to books and<br/>&gt;journal articles from there.</p><p>I know nothing about any work done by anyone else on this subject but<br/>have had occasion to think about and study such questions from my own<br/>perspective of developing the harmonics theory and how the whole<br/>universe works and in particular life.  So the following rave is a bit<br/>about my theory but aimed at coming around to the question raised.</p><p>IMO the universe began as a single very low frequency note, being the<br/>fundamental oscillation mode of the universe or something like that.<br/>Because the universe has a non-linear equation (this is compatible with<br/>GR) any such oscillation MUST develop harmonics.  Because the structure<br/>is 3D these harmonics also form centres at which energy is concentrated.<br/>This concentration highlights the non-linearity at the new frequencies<br/>and these also develop harmonics.  This leads to the development of ever<br/>higher frequencies so that eventually waves form which have wavelengths<br/>that match the distances between galaxies, stars, planets and eventually<br/>atoms and nucleons.  There is nothing but waves.</p><p>Along the way some of these waves become very stable and long-lived and<br/>some develop means of duplicating themselves and we call these &quot;life&quot;.<br/>In the distant past the most energy was in larger waves but is now in<br/>the nuclear waves throughout most of the universe.  So in the past any<br/>living things would have been much larger (the time of giants) and now<br/>these structures might still exist but they are composed of longer<br/>wavelengths and hence lower energies (according to Planck&apos;s law).<br/>The result is that these energies are not readily observable by science<br/>because they are too subtle compared to the chemical and nuclear<br/>energies observed on earth.  Therefore they are what might be called<br/>spirits or Gods.  These come in many shapes and sizes and may be<br/>galactic Gods, Solar Gods, Planetary Gods or Devas of smaller areas.</p><p>The oscillations associated with these larger entities are detectable<br/>but have not generally been recognised for what they are.  Some examples<br/>are the 7.5 Hz electromagnetic Schumann resonance and the 84 minutes<br/>gravitational oscillation of the earth (equal to the orbital period of a<br/>satellite at ground level).  The ratio between these two periods is<br/>37800 which is close to (and probably related to) my common 34560 ratio<br/>between levels of structure in the universe.  It is also equal to the<br/>ratio between the electron Compton frequency and the prime mode of the<br/>electrons orbits as defined by the Rydberg constant.  Alternatively this<br/>is equal to the expression 2*137.036^2 where 1/137.036 is the fine<br/>structure constant.  Why should the Earth show this same ratio as<br/>present in very much faster oscillations?  Answer, because the<br/>dimensions and mass of the earth are not random but cosmically<br/>determined.</p><p>The period of about 84 minutes is also found in many other places in the<br/>solar system.  The outer planets are at distances from the sun that are<br/>very near multiples of 82 light minutes.  The sun has a 160 minute<br/>oscillation.  The other planets (except Mars) have surface orbital<br/>periods of near 84, 168 or 252 minutes, all multiples of 84 minutes.</p><p>The inner planets are near multiples of 3 light minutes from the Sun and<br/>again the sun has an oscillation of about 5.5 minutes or near double<br/>that (the double is because each wave has two nodes).  So the periods of<br/>~160, ~80, ~6 and ~3 minutes are all around us.</p><p>The waves in the sea mostly have intervals of ~13 seconds in the surf<br/>and ~6.5 and ~3.25 seconds in harbours.  Periods of 26, 51 and 102<br/>seconds are also found as wave groupings.  Wave sizes also show clear<br/>variations over 3, 6 and 12 minutes and 20 and 40 minute very large<br/>groupings are visible from satellite photos.  Surfies know that super<br/>waves come at 20 minute intervals.</p><p>All of this is given to show that we live in a set of musically related<br/>waves that inundate everything.  Anyone that wants to understand how<br/>music can touch the soul will find it useful to understand the<br/>environment in which the soul developed.  The periods above are very<br/>deep in our being and we have activity cycles throughout the day and<br/>night (e.g. 90 minute sleep cycle) that are probably related to these<br/>cosmic forces.</p><p>Today there are people who are scientifically studying the mystical and<br/>these connections are beginning to be made.  The musical masters of the<br/>past knew that they got their music from the cosmos or God or whatever<br/>anyone wants to call it.  They tuned in to the subtle waves that pervade<br/>all space and time.</p><p>The ancients knew something about this too and made large structures<br/>which have proportions and sizes which reverberate to sounds at<br/>frequencies that match the cosmic energies.  Celts, Egyptians, Greeks,<br/>Chinese and Indians.</p><p>The keys such as F, C and G are the ones that contain the notes that are<br/>the ones that dominate the cosmic vibrations most of the time which is<br/>why they were chosen as the white notes.  However I believe that the<br/>correct present frequency for A is nearer to 450 Hz rather than 440 Hz<br/>although it probably varies a bit with time also.</p><p>Again, rhythms should match keys in being related musically (when the<br/>BPM is considered as a low frequency note) and both should be related to<br/>the size of the dimensions of cathedrals etc which should be (and<br/>probably were) related to the natural frequencies for sound and<br/>dimensions in nature.  In my experience structures from neolithic sites<br/>all over Europe show common units which are close to the modern imperial<br/>units.</p><p>The human body is also a cathedral.  Its oscillation modes have<br/>eigenstates which lead to certain energy centres and conduits which are<br/>called chakras, ki, and other names by eastern people who understood<br/>these things once long ago.  These frequencies are related to the<br/>Schumann resonance and the other natural oscillations.  If you want to<br/>reach the consciousness then playing the human instruments emotional<br/>centres will reach as deep as is possible to go.  The large scale<br/>structure of music including shape and repeats will reach deeper into<br/>the soul if it matches the longer periods that I have mentioned.</p><p>The main periods may be considered to be musically / harmonically<br/>related as follows:</p><p>  162    81   40.5  20.3   minutes             outer planets<br/>                                   &gt; ratio 7<br/>   23.1  11.6  5.8   2.9   minutes             inner planets</p><p>20.3 minutes / 12 = 101.5 seconds</p><p>  102    51    25.5   12.8   6.4   3.2 seconds    waves in ocean / sea<br/>                8.5</p><p>probable connection 2.9 minutes / 12 / 12 / 9 = 0.134 seconds =&gt; 7.45 Hz</p><p>ratio     24   27   30   32   36   40   45   48<br/>freq.    179  201  224  238  268  298  335  358  Hz   earth oscillation<br/>note       F    G    A   Bb    C    D    E    F</p><p>so that the scale of F is strongly related to the earth resonance.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=3651 href="#3651">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/1999 7:07:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Testify Brother</p></div><h3><a id=3652 href="#3652">ðŸ”—</a>Dale Scott &#x3C;adelscot@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/1999 9:24:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ray,</p><p>Wow, this is most fascinating.

(yep,<br/>Mahler again...)</p><p>Recently I&apos;ve been discussing with him the ideas of Gustav Theodor<br/>Fechner, whose work had a profound and lasting effect on Mahler&apos;s<br/>thought.  I was struck with its relevance to Ray&apos;s posting.</p><p>Fechner is best known today as the founder of &apos;psychophysics&apos;,<br/>which in a very altered form has become known now as<br/>&apos;physiological psychology&apos;.  He was well-known as a physicist<br/>as a younger man, and was instrumental in formulating the<br/>description of correlations between physical and perceptual<br/>differences in stimuli, particularly for sight and hearing.</p><p>After a prolonged and very serious illness in his 40s, he recovered<br/>completely, lived another 40 years, and became quite a mystic.</p><p>Fechner was a monist, and believed that life and matter were<br/>the same.  The implications of this idea are that everything<br/>in the universe is alive and has a soul, or alternatively, is<br/>part of an overall soul.</p><p>This resonates (pun intended) quite well with what Ray is saying.</p><p>The only book in English that I have been able to find on Fechner<br/>is called _Religion of a Scientist_:</p><p>Author    Fechner, Gustav Theodor, 1801-1887</p><p>Title     Religion of a scientist; selections from Gustav Th.<br/>          Fechner, edited &amp; translated by Walter Lowrie</p><p>Imprint   [New York] Pantheon Books [1946]</p><p>[selections from the Table of Contents:]<br/>Contents  Biography<br/>          Introductory:<br/>             A Religious Scientist<br/>             About Scientists in General<br/>             The Darwinian Theory<br/>             About Fechner&apos;s Religion<br/>          Three Motives and Grounds of Faith<br/>          Concerning Souls:<br/>             Souls of the Stars<br/>          The Soul Life of Plants:<br/>             Organs of Sense<br/>             The Character of Plants<br/>             The Questions of Freedom<br/>          God and Immortality:<br/>             The Daylight View: About God.<br/>             Life After Death: Perception and Memory<br/>          Confession of Faith:<br/>             About Christ<br/>             About the Bible<br/>             &quot;In God My Soul Reposes&quot;</p><p>I know it&apos;s off-topic,<br/>but just thought I&apos;d throw my 0.02 Semitones in.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
