Since<br/>the cent is my smallest step to measure an interval instead of the<br/>traditional half tone as is teached at the conservatory, I consider myself<br/>to be a *microtonalist*. 12TET fits into a this conception as long as we use<br/>this micro-measurement,  for instance for a scale in which all the intervals<br/>are<br/>deliberately multiples of 100 cents, so all the intervals attract each other<br/>in the same way. It seems logic to use 12TET for a dodecaphonic composition.<br/>Saying 25:24 is a microtone, because of its small size and 3:2 is a<br/>macrotone because it&apos;s bigger as its&apos; tempered neighbour doesn&apos;t do justice<br/>to the terms *micro* and *macro*. Compare microcosm and macrocosm.</p><p>&gt; Therefore, instead of the &quot;American Festival of Microtonal Music,&quot; we would<br/>&gt; have the &quot;American Association of Alternate Tunings,&quot; or AAAT.<br/>Sounds like the Andouilette AAAAA you can find on the menu of some<br/>traditional french restaurants.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf.</p></div><h3><a id=6625 href="#6625">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/1999 10:49:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p>Joe!<br/>    There is a misunderstanding here.
