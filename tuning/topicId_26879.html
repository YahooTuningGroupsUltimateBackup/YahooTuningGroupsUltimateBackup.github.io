Zarlino advocated 2/7-comma meantone temperament in<br/>practice, but the scholarly tradition of his day, being so obsessed<br/>with ancient Greek and Roman civilization, made it almost impossible<br/>for anyone to write a treatise on tuning without laying down some<br/>scales in ratios as the &quot;ideal&quot; or &quot;theoretical&quot; basis for their<br/>work. The ratios of Zarlino&apos;s just scale do a pretty good job of<br/>conveying what 2/7-comma meantone can actually do, though the<br/>meantone does it better, with fewer notes, no commatic shifts, and no<br/>commatic drifts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Zarlino scale cited has two D&apos;s:  D- at 10/9 and D at 9/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as we have been discussing...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but also has other &quot;enharmonic&quot; pitches:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Eb&apos;s:  Eb- at 32/27 and Eb at 6/5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F#&apos;s:  F#- at 25/18 and F# at 45/32<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bb&apos;s:  Bb- at 16/9 and Bb at 9/5<br/>&gt;<br/>I see Ben Johnston&apos;s notaion is being used here . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; NOW, my question is... are the differences between these pitches<br/>ALL<br/>&gt; SYNTONIC COMMAS as in the case of the D-, D?</p><p>You betcha!

I guess, given Zarlino&apos;s<br/>ultimate adoption of meantone temperament, the syntonic comma must be<br/>viewed as a unison vector . . . but that&apos;s just _one_ unison<br/>vector . . . a vector is just an arrow with a certain length and<br/>direction, regardless of where it appears in the lattice (between D-<br/>and D, between Eb- and Eb, etc.).</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2001 3:42:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Joseph Pehrson and everyone.</p><p>Indeed Zarlino took a great interest in _both_ just intonation<br/>(5-limit) and meantone temperaments for keyboard, as well as the<br/>standard temperament with equal semitones for the lute.</p><p>While regarding JI as the &quot;natural&quot; basis for vocal intonation, by the<br/>way, he noted in both early and late writings that voices seems to<br/>avoid the &quot;small steps&quot; or commas which appear on keyboard instruments<br/>in Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic. In other words, he suggests that the<br/>pure ratios of this scheme are realized by something which might now<br/>be called &quot;adaptive JI.&quot;</p><p>For keyboards, he generally finds temperament much more practical,<br/>describing his own 2/7-comma scheme in 1558, and adding in 1571<br/>descriptions of 1/4-comma and 1/3-comma also.</p><p>Note that while terms such as &quot;temperament&quot; or _participatio_ are<br/>common in the 16th century, &quot;meantone&quot; or &quot;mesotonic&quot; is as far as I<br/>know a later term. Strictly speaking, as has been discussed, only a<br/>1/4-comma temperament with pure major thirds fits the definition of a<br/>&quot;mean-tone&quot; with the whole-tone equal to the precise mean of the 9:8<br/>and 10:9 steps of the syntonic diatonic, although often the term is<br/>used more generally for other temperaments such as 2/7-comma,<br/>1/3-comma, etc.</p><p>Likewise, Zarlino&apos;s contemporary Francisco Salinas takes an interest<br/>in both JI and meantone keyboards: he favors 1/3-comma, but considers<br/>it less sonorous than alternatives with less heavy tempering of the<br/>fifth (and major third). The possibility of a circular system in only<br/>19 notes may have been a special attraction.</p><p>Here&apos;s Zarlino&apos;s 16-note JI system implemented on a keyboard, which he<br/>presents as interesting but difficult to play in practice -- an<br/>experimental solution we might say, in contrast to the usual approach<br/>of temperament. I&apos;ll show the octave 3C-4C (octave numbers first, 4C<br/>as middle C), which I map to two 12-note keyboards, although Zarlino&apos;s<br/>diagram shows the usual 16th-century approach of split keys for an<br/>instrument of this tuning size. Signed numbers show notes raised or<br/>lowered by a syntonic comma with reference to the chain of fifths<br/>F0-C0-G0:</p><p>             3Eb0             3F#-2              3Bb0<br/>             32:27            25:18              16:9<br/>             294.13           568.72            996.09<br/>             .......          ......             .....<br/>   3C#-2     3Eb+1            3F#-1    3G#-2     3Bb+1<br/>   25:24      6:5             45:32    25:16      9:5<br/>   70.67     315.64           590.22   772.63   1017.60<br/>          3D-1<br/>          10:9<br/>         182.40<br/>         ......<br/>3C0       3D0      3E-1    3F0        3G0     3A-1     3B-1   4C0<br/>1:1       9:8       5:4    4:3        3:2      5:3     15:8   2:1<br/> 0       203.91   386.31  498.04     701.96   884.36  1088.27 1200</p><p>Picture the &quot;D&quot; key split into two parts, and likewise the &quot;Eb,&quot; &quot;F#,&quot;<br/>and &quot;Bb&quot; keys.</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala file of this 16-note tuning:</p><p>! zarlin16.scl<br/>!<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 16-note JI scale implemented on an instrument with split keys<br/> 16<br/>!<br/> 25/24<br/> 10/9<br/> 9/8<br/> 32/27<br/> 6/5<br/> 5/4<br/> 4/3<br/> 25/18<br/> 45/32<br/> 3/2<br/> 25/16<br/> 5/3<br/> 16/9<br/> 9/5<br/> 15/8<br/> 2/1</p><p>Or, if a downloadable version of this file might be more convenient for<br/>some people:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/zarlin16.scl">http://value.net/~mschulter/zarlin16.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s Scala&apos;s information on ratios and sizes in cents, and let&apos;s<br/>hope that I&apos;ve entered the data correctly:</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s 16-note JI scale implemented on an instrument with split keys<br/>  0:          1/1            0.000000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         25/24           70.67245 classic chromatic semitone<br/>  2:         10/9            182.4038 minor whole tone<br/>  3:          9/8            203.9100 major whole tone<br/>  4:         32/27           294.1351 Pythagorean minor third<br/>  5:          6/5            315.6414 minor third<br/>  6:          5/4            386.3139 major third<br/>  7:          4/3            498.0452 perfect fourth<br/>  8:         25/18           568.7176 classic augmented fourth<br/>  9:         45/32           590.2239 tritone<br/> 10:          3/2            701.9553 perfect fifth<br/> 11:         25/16           772.6278 classic augmented fifth<br/> 12:          5/3            884.3591 major sixth, BP sixth<br/> 13:         16/9            996.0905 Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 14:          9/5            1017.596 just minor seventh, BP seventh<br/> 15:         15/8            1088.269 classic major seventh<br/> 16:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>Incidentally, I tend to follow Zarlino in taking rational and tempered<br/>tunings as each valid and important approaches.</p><p>Curiously, this applies for me with neo-Gothic tunings and<br/>temperaments, where I might lean now toward a system with pure ratios<br/>such as 14:18:21:24, now to the complex ratios of a usual Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and now to some tempered system.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/13/2001 6:47:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26900">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26900</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is an easy one...
