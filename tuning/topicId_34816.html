Does anyone know what he is talking about? If he means 2^phi in place of 3, that&apos;s nearly 40 cents *sharp*, and hardly seems like something someone would suggest to temper 12 tones to the octave.</p></div><h3><a id=34825 href="#34825">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>2/25/2002 7:27:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes Brouncker proposed 17-tET (Joe please note). See<br/><a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Brouncker.html">http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Brouncker.html</a></p><p>From this page:<br/>&quot;These studies were mathematics and music, two topics which<br/>Brouncker loved. It was during this time that he worked on a<br/>publication which would in fact be his only book. Descartes had<br/>written a paper on music in 1618 but it had never been published.<br/>Only after Descartes&apos; death in 1650 did a Dutch publisher print<br/>it as a 58 page pamphlet with the title Renati Descartes Musicae<br/>Compendium. In 1653 Brouncker published his English translation<br/>of Descartes&apos; work but he added notes of his own which doubled<br/>the size of the work. Mersenne had proposed a scale of 12 equal<br/>semitones after Descartes&apos; manuscript had been written and in<br/>his notes Brouncker proposed a variation of Mersenne&apos;s ideas but<br/>he divided the scale into 17 equal semitones. One should not be<br/>surprised that all these mathematicians were contributing to<br/>musical theory and indeed Brouncker&apos;s notes are highly<br/>mathematical using algebra and logarithms. One might wonder why<br/>Brouncker chose 17 equal semitones and again the reason was a<br/>mathematical one for he derived this from taking ratios based on<br/>the golden section.&quot;</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
