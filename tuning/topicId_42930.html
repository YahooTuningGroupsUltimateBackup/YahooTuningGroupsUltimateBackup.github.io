This gives us fifths of size (176/7)^(1/8),<br/>or 697.81 cents, which is more or less 21/109-comma meantone.

I&apos;ve found one example--if we temper 15 notes in<br/>kleismic temperament, using a minor third generator of (56/9)^(1/10),<br/>we get five 9/7 thirds after the ten major thirds. Alas, the sharp<br/>thirds go with sharp fifths, which could pass for 17/11&apos;s but not<br/>very well for 3/2&apos;s.</p></div><h3><a id=42941 href="#42941">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2003 8:09:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p>I am not sure which aspect of this is being questioned as being noticed.

The circle of 19 fifths has twelve<br/>fifths from F to E-sharp of ~695.61 cents, or ~6.34 cents narrow<br/>(such that 8 consective fifths give an exact 9:7).  The remaining<br/>seven fifths are of equal size and start on F-flat (same pitch as E-<br/>sharp, but renamed) and end at F; these are ~693.23 cents, or ~8.72<br/>cents narrow.  The three auxiliary tones (B-semiflat, F-semisharp,<br/>and C-semisharp) are tuned as just 11:9&apos;s above G, D, and A,<br/>respectively. &gt;&gt;</p><p>This would seem to make that portion of the cirle of fifths starting<br/>on F and ending on E-sharp the virtual equivalent of Erv Wilson&apos;s<br/>temperment, i.e., for all practical purposes equal-beating.  This is<br/>something that I didn&apos;t notice until your messages pointed this out,<br/>although at the time I devised the 19+3 temperament (1978) I *did*<br/>notice that the major triads have a (harmonic) consonance much more<br/>akin to 1/4-comma meantone temperament than to 19-ET, but melodically<br/>the intervals sound more like 19-ET than 1/4-comma meantone.  Now I<br/>understand why.</p><p>Would Paul (or any others) consider using this instead of 19-ET,<br/>particularly in view of the 15-limit otonalities that the 3<br/>additional tones provide?  It&apos;s true that a guitar would require some<br/>zig-zag fretting, but it should still be easier to play than a 31-ET<br/>instrument.</p><p>--George</p></div>
