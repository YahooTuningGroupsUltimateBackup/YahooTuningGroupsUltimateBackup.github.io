Then, like the Turks, I can mix and match upper and<br/>lower tetrachords as I see fit.</p><p>        Rather than sit at the keyboard all the time I was thinking<br/>I&apos;d burn a CD of the exercises for me to sing along with and repeat.</p><p>        I believe I should avoid a piano sound for singing with, but<br/>the other end, a sine wave, is very difficult for me to track.  Any<br/>suggestions?</p><p>--<br/>wm,<br/>breaking out in goosebumps from the high soprano part in Allegri&apos;s<br/>Miserere Mass coming forth from my studio monitor speakers as I type...</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Not too hard to<br/>find . . .</p><p>I rather like the rectified sine wave timbre I used for my listening<br/>examples. The amplitude of the nth partial is less than 1/(n^2) times the<br/>amplitude of the fundamental, yet the tone is &quot;coherent&quot; enough so that<br/>small deviations, either harmonic or melodic, are quite easy to hear.</p><p>I found that timbres where the amplitude of the nth partial approached 1/n<br/>for large n sounded too &quot;buzzy&quot; for my taste.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
