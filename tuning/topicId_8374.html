We will be followed by fellow jam bands Another Planet<br/>and the Dan Rockett band. 18+, $7.</p><p>The night is a benefit for my dear friend and musical collaborator Jennifer<br/>Bliss, who was in a car accident around Christmas, shattered a heel and both<br/>ankles, had no medical insurance, and was driving a friend&apos;s car<br/>out-of-state so auto insurance won&apos;t cover much. Please help us help her.</p></div>
