You say you&apos;re not worrying about octaves but you also say you came up with a 17 note scale...does that scale have a repeat interval other than the octave?  Or does it not repeat into other registers?</p><p>As you created that web of intervals that emanate from C, did you reduce intervals by octaves?  For instance If you went C-E-G and then G-B-D, would that D be 204 cents or 1404 cents in your scale?  Let me put it another way in case that doesn&apos;t make sense: if you are generating your scale by going up and down by 5/4&apos;s and 3/2&apos;s and you don&apos;t reduce to an octave, C-Eb-E-G-Bb-B-D-F-F#-A-C&apos; (for example) will be:<br/>0<br/>315<br/>386<br/>702<br/>1017<br/>1088<br/>1404<br/>1719<br/>1790<br/>2106<br/>2421<br/>(approximately)</p><p>If you do reduce to the octave, it will look like:<br/>0<br/>21<br/>204<br/>315<br/>386<br/>519<br/>590<br/>702<br/>906<br/>1017<br/>1088<br/>1200</p><p>If you are doing the latter (which I suspect you are) you will eventually end up with the 5-limit lattice, which can also be looked at as an infinite number of chains of 3/2&apos;s offset from each other by 81/80&apos;s.  If you&apos;re stopping at 17 notes you probably already have some notes that are only about 21 cents apart (that&apos;s 81/80 doing its thing).  I wonder why you decided to stop there?</p><p>If you keep going with this process past 17 notes, this leads to some wacky stuff because the Syntonic comma differs from the Pythagorean comma by the Schisma, which is just a little over a cent.  For instance if you go down in 3/2&apos;s from C to go C-F-Bb-Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-Cb-Fb, that Fb will be a Schisma away from your E that you got by going up a 5/4 from C.  In truth, you could easily get a scale that sounds indistinguishable from 5-limit JI with a single chain of 3/2&apos;s.

I think I&apos;m after what Denny did to<br/>those pianos.</p><p>Michael Harrison has this section<br/><a href="http://www.michaelharrison.com/web/pure_tunings.htm">http://www.michaelharrison.com/web/pure_tunings.htm</a> but it has not been<br/>populated.</p><p>This description (and the CD Revelations I bought)<br/>&quot;* By combining carefully selected pitch relationships with various<br/>performance techniques, this tuning creates undulating waves of shimmering<br/>and pulsating sounds, with what sound like &#x1C; phase shifting&#x1D; and &#x1C; note<br/>bending&#x1D; effects and other acoustical phenomena. Sometimes the overtones are<br/>so audible that it sounds as if many different instruments are resonating<br/>from the piano. The tuning has so many beautiful and exotic sounds latent<br/>within it, that for the first few months, every time I played it, I<br/>discovered new harmonic regions and felt like an explorer in unknown and<br/>distant realms. &quot;*</p><p>makes me want to try it. He further describes:<br/><a href="http://www.michaelharrison.com/web/pure_intonation.htm">http://www.michaelharrison.com/web/pure_intonation.htm</a></p><p>* Revelation takes this concept to another level by incorporating three sets<br/>of adjacently tuned &#x1C; celestial commas&#x1D; (a 64:63 ratio, or approximately an<br/>&#x1C; eighth&#x1D; tone) into the harmonic fabric of every octave of the tuning. When<br/>these commas sound simultaneously or in rapid succession, they produce<br/>never-before-heard combinations of modes, harmonies, and acoustical<br/>phenomena. The comma is thus freed from its restricted status as an<br/>&quot;out-of-tune&quot; dissonance that, until recently, was disguised, avoided or<br/>obliterated by tempered tunings, compositional styles, performance practices<br/>and instrument designs. *</p><p>oh wait - I&apos;ve not read this page before</p><p>*The tuning&apos;s unique qualities exist in the relationships between the black<br/>and white keys, which reveal a wide variety of exotic and colorful<br/>intervals. The &#x1C; revelation&#x1D; tuning has a practical symmetry whereby all of<br/>the white keys form a series of Pythagorean fifths (a 3:2 ratio), and all of<br/>the black keys form another series of Pythagorean fifths, with each black<br/>key tuned to the seventh overtone (a 7:4 ratio) above each corresponding<br/>white key. The 7:4 ratio is the naturally occurring minor seventh that<br/>exists in the overtone series (approximately 31% of a semi-tone flat from<br/>the equal tempered minor seventh). As a result, three black keys are tuned<br/>to the &#x1C; celestial comma&#x1D; (a 64:63 ratio) below three adjacent white keys.<br/>This creates ample opportunity to use what I refer to as the &#x1C; pulsating<br/>comma effect&#x1D; in a variety of different harmonic contexts, where the<br/>adjacent commas sound simultaneously. This symmetrical layout of the white<br/>and black keys allows for a very intuitive approach to playing the piano.<br/>For example, the white keys are purely diatonic; by adding any black keys<br/>into the mix you will get either &#x1C; septimal&#x1D; minor intervals or the &#x1C;<br/>pulsating comma effect.&#x1D; *</p><p>*The twelve pitches are tuned to the following twelve harmonics or &#x1C;<br/>overtones&#x1D; of the fundamental note F. For white keys: F=1, C=3, G=9, D=27,<br/>A=81, E=243, and B=729 (all of which are multiples of the prime number 3);<br/>and for black keys: E-flat=7, B-flat=21, F#=63, C#=189, and G#=567 (all of<br/>which are multiples of the primes 3 and 7).</p><p>That would seem to be it.

I think you&apos;ll get what you<br/>want with an AXiS, which will enable you to easily retune things to<br/>whatever you want.</p><p>If we&apos;re sticking to the 5-limit, then it seems like what you want is<br/>to have 3/2 and 5/4 as your base intervals. So that&apos;s exactly how I&apos;d<br/>set the AXiS up - make one of the directions be 3/2, and another<br/>direction be 5/4. This is basically what the AXiS&apos;s &quot;harmonic table&quot;<br/>layout already is - one direction is a major third, and another is a<br/>perfect fifth. All of the 5-limit intervals in the system that you<br/>mentioned above will be reachable by this layout, and the whole thing<br/>will be really intuitive because you&apos;ll have a visual diagram that<br/>tells you exactly what the logic of the system is.</p><p>OK, but now you want the 7-limit as well. Well, you actually said you<br/>want the 9-limit, but since you have 3/2&apos;s already, then 9/4 is<br/>already covered. How do we throw the 7-limit in there? Well, the<br/>solution, of course, is for you to buy an infinite number of AXiS<br/>controllers and stack them vertically on top of one another, so that<br/>this new vertical direction represents 7/4.</p><p>If that seems unsatisfactory, then there is one small compromise you<br/>can make which will probably be good enough for what you want, and<br/>that&apos;s to microtemper. Microtemperaments are temperaments that are so<br/>close to just that you can&apos;t tell the difference. If you can find a<br/>way to work 7/4 in as a combination of 3/2 and 5/4, then you&apos;ll be<br/>able to map the entire thing out on a 2d harmonic lattice. Since it<br/>seems like what you want is to learn how JI &quot;logic&quot; works, but have to<br/>avoid buying infinite AXiSes, this will probably be good enough.</p><p>One good option is to take the 5/4 axis and divide it by two, so each<br/>step in that direction moves you up by half a major third. If you just<br/>ignore every other step, you end up with 5-limit JI. But, by doing<br/>this, then two and a half major thirds puts you to 7/4, so you can get<br/>the 7-limit that way. If you use this tuning, then I&apos;d set the major<br/>thirds equal to 387 cents, meaning that they&apos;re less than one cent<br/>sharp of just. Then the 7/4&apos;s will be 967.5 cents, which is 1.3 cents<br/>flat of just. You&apos;d never hear the difference. So the end result is<br/>that you can pretty much think of it as being JI, but doing something<br/>like this lets you multiplex the whole thing onto a two-dimensional<br/>keyboard like the AXiS.</p><p>There are other options than this as well, some of which are even<br/>closer to just, but the closer you get, the harder it&apos;ll be to fit the<br/>whole thing manageably onto an AXiS.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2011 11:53:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 12 May 2011 05:02, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; One good option is to take the 5/4 axis and divide it by two, so each<br/>&gt; step in that direction moves you up by half a major third.
