In my experience, each<br/>member is a scholar, some of the members that I have come to know are<br/>like institutions of learning. I have never seen so many scholars who<br/>are, in a true sense, pundits, applying their knowledge and<br/>experience with such singular singlemindedness of purpose. The<br/>posterity can complain of  neither the derth of musical scales nor of<br/>information about them.</p><p>Thanks to the contributions of the members of the Tuning list in<br/>general, and offline correspondence with Paul in particular, I have<br/>been the fortunate recipient of fresh material, insight in and<br/>gleanings on shruti and related topics.  I know there is so much to<br/>learn, that this growth process will go on for ever.</p><p>As far as shruti is concerned, this is the end of the beginning.<br/>Using appropriate software **[which one?]**, I will &quot;re-invent the<br/>wheel&quot; by firsh-hand measurements of Sa-Ma, Sa-Pa and the Octave<br/>relationships. The research will continue from there.</p><p>The shruti summary is as under:</p><p>1.  There are 22 shruti-s.  They are classified into 5 groups for<br/>reasons of aesthetics. [This grouping especially needs further study].</p><p>2.  9 shruti-s give rise to Sa-Ma interval, and 13 shruti-s, Sa-Pa<br/>interval.<br/>3.  Out of those 22 shruti-s, 12 have been selected, to be called<br/>swara-s.  The swara-s are, first of all and most of all, shruti-s<br/>only, though they do assume additional significance.</p><p>4. Shruti-s have a dual aspect: As the measurable, reproducible<br/>frequencies; and, secondly, as dynamic intonations. In the first<br/>case, the shruti-s are stand-alone; in the second, they can be, and<br/>are ONLY to be, percieved during a performance.  The performer does<br/>not start with a scale of 22 shruti-s; rather, he uses them with the<br/>only consideration of aesthetics in mind.  The performer can be<br/>completely ignorant, as far as using shruti-s is concerned.  However,<br/>he needs to be learned to study them in isolation, that is, as apart<br/>from performance.  The first is a technical measurement, the second<br/>is an aesthetic judgement; they go hand in hand. The performer can<br/>use a shruti lower or higher, depending upon the requirements and<br/>extent of flexibility of the raga or his aesthetic mood.  However,<br/>there are raga-s, which require use of only specific shruti-s: for<br/>example Todi, for its komal Re, komal Ga, and komal Dha. The<br/>performer shall not compromise in such cases.  Even the specificity<br/>of such shruti-s is a matter, eventually, of aesthetics.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
