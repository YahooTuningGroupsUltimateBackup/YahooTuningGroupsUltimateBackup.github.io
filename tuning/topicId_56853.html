Dinarra Players were<br/>Alejandro S&iuml;&iquest;&half;nchez and Johannes Stenger. The program of this Concert<br/>included Modern and Jazz music, and was executed using the two types of<br/>dinarras described further back, i.e. the acoustic and the electric.</p><p>The &iuml;&iquest;&half;Second Dinarra Concert&iuml;&iquest;&half; was held on Friday, October 1, 1999,<br/>(International Day of Music) the venue being on this occasion the<br/>Ministerio de Educaci&iuml;&iquest;&half;n y Cultura  (M.E.C.). At this Concert  electric<br/>dinarras and other musical instruments were used. A more ambitious<br/>program this time included:</p><p>- A dinarra composition by Diego Legrand called &iuml;&iquest;&half;Tres Ep&iuml;&iquest;&half;stolas&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>-  (&iuml;&iquest;&half;Three Epistles&iuml;&iquest;&half;) which was executed by Johannes Stenger and<br/>-  Alejandro S&iuml;&iquest;&half;nchez.<br/>- A music composition by Carlos Weiske termed &iuml;&iquest;&half;Peculiar&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>-  (&iuml;&iquest;&half;Peculiar&iuml;&iquest;&half;) which was played by Alejandro Camb&iuml;&iquest;&half;n (Double-<br/>-  bass), Ulises Ferretti (Recorder) and Johannes Stenger (Electric<br/>      Dinarra).</p><p>The above melodies were followed by a variety of popular jazz<br/>compositions executed in electric dinarra duet (Johannes Stenger and<br/>Alejandro S&iuml;&iquest;&half;nchez).</p><p>With regard to the above described &iuml;&iquest;&half;Second Dinarra Concert&iuml;&iquest;&half; there<br/>appeared an article by Nelson Giguens Risso (well known music critic) in<br/>the magazine &iuml;&iquest;&half;Revista Sinf&iuml;&iquest;&half;nica&iuml;&iquest;&half; pertaining to December 1999, reviewing<br/>the Concert, which translated into English, is quoted below:</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Notoriously experimental, the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Three Epistles&iuml;&iquest;&half; by Diego Legrand, though<br/>repetitious, had passages of fine lyrical music;  &iuml;&iquest;&half;Peculiar&iuml;&iquest;&half;, composed<br/>by Carlos Weiske, followed. In the latter  intonations having excellent<br/>color were heard -  and  an Americanist spirit was discernable -<br/>finally  various jazz popular melodies interpreted by Alejandro Sanchez<br/>and Johannes Stenger in electric dinarra were played. Throughout the<br/>whole Concert, in which Alejandro  Camb&iuml;&iquest;&half;n (Double-bass) and Ulises<br/>Ferretti (Recorder) also  intervened,  the dinarra &iuml;&iquest;&half;s good qualities<br/>were noteworthy, being a 6 string microtonal instrument, with<br/>intonations  both strictly related with harmonics 3 an 5 and  free. It<br/>was noted that the dinarra is an instrument which must be used basically<br/>for duets of jazzistic style, which have great charm, and are<br/>simultaneously very defined  and profound. It was a Concert of much<br/>promise,  stimulating and full of novelty,  which took place in the the<br/>International Day of Music at the M.E.C.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>--<br/>Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi<br/>Simon Bolivar 1260<br/>11300 Montevideo<br/>Uruguay<br/>Phone: (598)(2) 7080952<br/>Webpage (Spanish): <a href="http://www.geocities.com/dinarra2000/dinarra.html">http://www.geocities.com/dinarra2000/dinarra.html</a></p><p>(IFIS): <a href="http://www.invention-ifia.ch/ifis/sectiong/g0101/g0101.htm">www.invention-ifia.ch/ifis/sectiong/g0101/g0101.htm</a></p></div>
