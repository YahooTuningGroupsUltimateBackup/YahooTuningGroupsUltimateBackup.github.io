Is Young the first guy to do it?<br/>&gt;Are there definite goals that a minimalist composer is aiming for? Or,<br/>&gt;does it vary from person to person? Do minimalists agree on what<br/>&gt;minimalism is?</p><p>While Pat&apos;s references are good, I would like to take a stab at Neil&apos;s<br/>questions. To me, minimalism implies a lot more than just repetition, as<br/>some people seem to think. Instead, when repetition and other techniques<br/>that increase the musical redundancy force the listener to stop listening<br/>for rhetorical form and linear logic, the listening experience can move to<br/>another sort of plane that I often liken to meditation. As meditation is an<br/>active, not a passive activity, I think those who characterize this way of<br/>listening as &quot;zoning out&quot; or the works as &quot;hypnotic&quot; are being unfair.</p><p>In addition to repetition, tonality is crucial, I think, because then the<br/>tones are all related through hierarchical structure. This effect is<br/>heightened through the use of JI, as in the works of Young and Riley. As<br/>Meyer-Eppler and others have pointed out, atonality and serialism increase<br/>the information flow, which is what the minimalists sought to, well,<br/>minimize. The same is true of meter, when there is one, the beats are<br/>related by a steady pulse.</p><p>Thus I have a problem including Feldman, Satie, Cage, and even Young&apos;s Trio<br/>under the minimalist umbrella. That said, like all artistic labels, Neil,<br/>this one is ultimately subjective. In the narrowest sense, minimalism<br/>includes the works done by composers like Young, Riley, Reich, Glass,<br/>Conrad, Gibson, and so on in the period from about 1963 through the<br/>mid-70s.</p><p>After this time, many of these composers (with the notable exception of<br/>Young) continued to use many of the minimalist techniques but in a much<br/>richer vocabulary. Reich&apos;s works continue to use many minimal techniques,<br/>but are hardly the stark process pieces of the 1960s. Riley&apos;s string<br/>quartets are almost prose-like in their irregular changes, and Glass, well,<br/>is Glass.</p><p>Nevertheless, many people continue to associate them with the label<br/>&quot;minimalism,&quot; the same way that Picasso was always a &quot;cubist,&quot; I suppose.<br/>If one understands that the term is no longer used in its narrow and most<br/>descriptive sense, I suppose it&apos;s as useful as many artistic labels in that<br/>these composers share the inheritance of certain techniques and<br/>characteristics from the bygone days of minimalist purity.</p><p>One reviewer even referred to the pieces on my CD as &quot;hyper-minimalist,&quot;<br/>which really surprised me, even though I gratefully acknowledge the<br/>influence of composers like Riley and Reich. The pieces are certainly not<br/>minimalist in the narrow sense, let alone &quot;hyper-minimalist,&quot; but you can<br/>see how terms like this tend to expand over time.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
