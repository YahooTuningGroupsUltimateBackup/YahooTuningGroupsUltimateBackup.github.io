I&apos;ve downloaded the clips and had a quick look at some<br/>&gt; &gt;spectrograms. While I need to study them further, there was one thing I<br/>&gt; &gt;noticed right away. Instead of generating subharmonic partials, what is<br/>&gt; &gt;happening is that the main note you are singing is becomming the third<br/>&gt; &gt;partial of a series with a fundamental a twelvth lower.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whew! Just as I expected. If Jim was indeed singing a &quot;subharmonic series&quot;,<br/>&gt; I would really look like an ass.</p><p>How low is the frequency of these fundamentals in the clips and what in the<br/>vocal apparatus, given that I normally cannot hit a bass note lower than about<br/>a C (which I had assumed was about the limit of my vocal folds), would be able<br/>to sustain such low tones?  Moreover,  what&apos;s your analysis of the &quot;sub 5&quot;<br/>clips? (I assume Dante you were referring to the &quot;sub 3 examples&quot;) - how low<br/>are their respective fundamentals, esp. the 2nd half of the 2nd example where<br/>the &quot;main note sung&quot; is ~G# (~100hz by my reckoning)?</p><p>Thanks for taking an interest in these clips.  I am curious to hear more about<br/>what you guys find in them.</p><p>BTW, I cannot believe how much this cheap little sound card mic was able to<br/>capture and am surprised that the recordings have enough information in them to<br/>be useful - anyone know the general frequency response of these things?</p><p>~Jim</p></div><h3><a id=4317 href="#4317">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

My assumption all along is that the vocal<br/>folds produce a fundamental vibration (in addition to many of its harmonic<br/>overtones) and then the false vocal folds, arytenoids and other structures<br/>reinforce every other vibration, every third vibration, every fourth etc.<br/>(of the original fund. vibrations).  If there are tones appearing that are<br/>lower than primary vibration of the folds I presumed they could be called<br/>&quot;undertones&quot; and if (as I hear them) they occur as fractions of fund.: 1/2,<br/>1/3, 1/4 etc. then they could be called subharmonics.

The<br/>point I&apos;ve been trying to emphasize is that with all these phenomena, what<br/>you end up with (sounding at a given point in time) is a harmonic series and<br/>never a subharmonic series. If the laryngeal structures are reinforcing<br/>every third vibration, then the true fundamental is a perfect twelfth lower<br/>that the normal one, and you will have an overtone series over the true<br/>fundamental which includes the normal one as a partial. Same goes for any<br/>other &quot;subharmonic&quot; behavior (period 2, period 4, etc.). These phenomena<br/>occur one at a time, not all at once. As for terminology, I guess I just<br/>worry that people will misunderstand this and think that you&apos;re producing a<br/>utonal chord with your voice.</p></div><h3><a id=4441 href="#4441">ðŸ”—</a>Jim Cole &#x3C;jimcole@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/1999 8:47:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; what you end up with (sounding at a given point in time) is a harmonic<br/>series and<br/>&gt; never a subharmonic series.

Perhaps my  main assumption is not correct:  I think I hear &quot;sub 2&quot;<br/>(octave below initiated fund.)sounding with &quot;sub 3&quot; (octave and fifth) so<br/>that the lowest notes are a fifth apart.  Are they both there simultaneously<br/>in the sub 3 clips at our site?  Have you (or anyone else here on the list -<br/>Dante?) analyzed all the clips yet?  Just today I was getting sub 4 (two<br/>octaves) and I thought I heard sub 3 creeping in with it (two low notes a<br/>fourth apart).  Yes, I see your point that if only one low note occurs with<br/>the original fundamental tone then the low note can be construed as the new<br/>fundamental.  BTW, I just got those books on chaos, fractals and power<br/>Laws - pretty daunting tomes!</p><p>As for terminology, I guess I just<br/>&gt; worry that people will misunderstand this and think that you&apos;re producing<br/>a<br/>&gt; utonal chord with your voice.</p><p>I hope I can - if not now - someday</p><p>~Jim</p></div>
