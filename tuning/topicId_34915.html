JI<br/>seemed to be a wholly &quot;tonal&quot; basis for composition.   I figured atonality<br/>was best suited for an ET.  This was  based on some (obviously very<br/>spotty) experiments I had done.</p><p>But after doing some more recent experiements, I&apos;ve completely changed my<br/>mind.  Not only about converting the harmonies in that (the String Orc<br/>piece) and other, pieces from 12tet into JI, but about, for example, all<br/>the stuff Monz talks about regarding Schoenberg&apos;s music as &quot;composing out<br/>higher overtones&quot;.   It seems that it may be all true.</p><p>I mentioned, for example, that tuning up the set &quot;014&quot; (in forte&apos;s<br/>set-theory notation) seemed pointless----   1/1: 16/15 : 5/4  just didn&apos;t<br/>seem that exciting.   This is the kind of thing I had tried in my initial<br/>experiments.</p><p>Paul suggested 16:17:20 (I believe)  ,  and I thought about this.  The<br/>most powerful aural experiences I had had with JI were when I could really<br/>hear the caressing &quot;buzz&quot; of partials locking in together.  so perhaps<br/>there might be something to the idea of realizing every harmony, as much<br/>as possible, as some sort of segment of the overtone series.    1/1  :<br/>16/15  :  5/4  would NOT be such a harmony, since 16/15 is not a partial<br/>of 1/1.</p><p>so anyway, I took one of the chords from my string orc piece, namely</p><p>Eb3, G3, Bb3, F4, A4, E5, F#5.</p><p>(4=middle C octave.)</p><p>I tried to make every tone an overtone of Eb.  Hence,</p><p>&#x9;     4:5:6:9:11:17:19</p><p>It worked!!  It totally locked in.  by ear, I could tell that this is what<br/>I was trying to achieve in 12Tet.  Partch might say this couldn&apos;t be,<br/>because some of those tones are  50 cents off or more between the<br/>JI-version and the 12tet-version, (he says something about this in<br/>Genesis)  but I think he&apos;s wrong (or maybe I&apos;m<br/>misremembering/interpreting his  text).  At any rate, I could tell that my<br/>ear had surely been trying to  compose out this Otonal-segment.</p><p>In fact, I realized that in spacing out all the chords in this piece, I<br/>was just composing out selections of the overtone series, often with<br/>(seemingly random) higher overtones (i.e.  13+)!!  It was a depressing and<br/>cool revelation at the same time!!  I thought I had some sort of unique<br/>sense of harmony, but no, I&apos;m just an overtone guy!!</p><p>So now I&apos;m thinking that the juiciness in the harmony of Feldman &amp;<br/>Messiaen,  from where I learned the sense of harmony that went into this<br/>string orc work, may also come from this<br/>desperate-attempt-to-find-higher-overtones-in-12-eq.</p><p>fun fun fun.  more experiments.  more music.  yay.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=34916 href="#34916">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 1:51:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I suppose a lot of this will be obvious to many on this list, but<br/>others<br/>&gt; may find points of empathy, and/or interest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A while ago, I posted this String Orc piece on metatuning:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/medit.c.mp3">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/medit.c.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich remarked:<br/>&gt;       &gt;this sounds<br/>&gt;         &gt;    like it would be<br/>&gt;           &gt;  exceptionally well-suited to a john<br/>&gt;            &gt; delaubenfels adaptive tuning<br/>&gt;            &gt; treatment, run in 19-limit otonal mode . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I at first was skeptical about this idea, since it had seemed to me<br/>up to<br/>&gt; then that atonality (or what I had thought of as &quot;atonality) was<br/>really<br/>&gt; not suited to be &quot;converted&quot; or even  composed originally, in JI.<br/>JI<br/>&gt; seemed to be a wholly &quot;tonal&quot; basis for composition.
