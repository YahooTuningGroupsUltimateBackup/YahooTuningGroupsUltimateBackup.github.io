This is useful, because<br/>whereas people probably wouldn&apos;t talk about godzilla in 14-EDO, they<br/>definitely talk about semaphore in it.</p><p>So under this usage, &quot;semaphore&quot; basically just refers to the 2.3.7<br/>49/48 temperament, and &quot;godzilla&quot; refers to the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 49/48 and<br/>81/80 temperament. Godzilla and superpelog and beep are all something<br/>like full-limit &quot;extensions&quot; of semaphore. Therefore, a really clean<br/>compromise between all of these terms is thus:</p><p>1) Semaphore is the 2.3.7 49/48 rank-2 temperament.<br/>2) Godzilla is the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 49/48 and 81/80 rank-2 temperament.<br/>3) The <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 49/48 rank-3 temperament is something else, like &quot;Semiphore.&quot;</p><p>In other words, I propose we switch Semiphore and Semaphore on the<br/>wiki. Nobody really uses the term Semiphore for the 2.3.7 49/48<br/>temperament anyway, and also nobody uses the term Semaphore to mean<br/>the planar temperament anyway. Godzilla will remain the way it is.<br/>This will lead to a minimum of changes because all of the stuff about<br/>Godzilla stays intact, and it&apos;s only obscure subgroup and planar stuff<br/>that will change. In fact I&apos;ll offer to do those changes.</p><p>Graham&apos;s agreed to this convention and says he&apos;ll update his<br/>temperament finder to Godzilla. What does Gene say about swapping<br/>Semiphore and Semaphore, and then we can move on from this dark age in<br/>7-limit tuning history?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104572 href="#104572">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2012 4:09:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Graham&apos;s agreed to this convention and says he&apos;ll update his<br/>&gt; temperament finder to Godzilla.
