One of the co-ordinators at an arts<br/>workshop I attend most days thinks it&apos;s an improvisation by Chick<br/>Corea and Keith Jarrett, but I think he&apos;s just guessing.&quot;</p><p>Normally &quot;Yahoo Answers&quot; is full of rubbish, but this deserves<br/>consideration. Slow piece for two JI pianos written at least 10 years ago?<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2008 4:05:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jarrett premiered Lou Harrison&apos;s Concerto for piano with selected orchestra, which is in Kirnberger II.   Jarrett liked the tuning so much that he kept his own piano in it. Perhpas this is the tuning in question.</p></div>
