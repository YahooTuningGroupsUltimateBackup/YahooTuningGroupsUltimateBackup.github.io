The performance came off amazingly.  I would say<br/>that Dan had achieved about 60% at the final rehearsal you saw of the<br/>way he performed it during the concert.  He *really* came alive with<br/>it.  It was close to astonishing.  I was so glad to be able to get a<br/>performer like this who is *so* completely dedicated to contemporary<br/>music.</p><p>but did the &quot;justness&quot; of the tuning come off as<br/>&gt; intended? not necessarily an important question, perhaps there was<br/>no one in the audience who cared about that aspect anyway . . .</p><p>***It&apos;s true that most of the comments of the general audience that I<br/>heard were of the nature &quot;well I thought the piece was terrific and<br/>pretty much *forgot* about the tuning part...&quot;</p><p>However, in speaking with some audience members later, they *did*<br/>notice some of the strange acoustical effects, such as the &quot;fusion&quot;<br/>of different chord notes into a &quot;one pitch&quot; sensation and such like.</p><p>Certainly, *I* heard these effects, and I was on stage turning pages<br/>and not even out in front where I could hear the speakers better.</p><p>I guess somebody said the piece sounded &quot;trippy&quot; which indicated that<br/>he at least perceived that something &quot;unusual&quot; was going on...</p><p>Thanks for all the help, by the way, at the rehearsal.  It made it<br/>much more &quot;authoritative&quot; to have the inventor of the scale there<br/>during the final rehearsal.</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
