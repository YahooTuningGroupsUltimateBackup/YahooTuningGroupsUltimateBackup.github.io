You can change the range<br/>of patches for the accidentals too, if you want to use some<br/>other ones, or want more accidentals than are available using them.</p><p>I&apos;ve just been debugging it - it wasn&apos;t working before.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm</a></p><p>I thought it might be relevant with the current discussion<br/>of various ways of doing accidentals in midi etc.</p><p>Here is how it goes:</p><p>Suppose you have a melody line in nineteen equal.<br/>In FTS you relay it so that the twelve notes of the<br/>score are mapped in some particular way to nineteen<br/>equal, e.g. with all the accidentals as the flats<br/>of the note above. You do it using a mode of nineteen<br/>equal (Arpeggio in FTS), so that FTS knows what the<br/>underlying scale is for the accidentals.</p><p>Now suppose you want a D# instead of an Eb somewhere in<br/>your score.</p><p>You do that using the Seashore patch like this:</p><p>Seashore (drops all notes down by one scale degree)<br/>Eb note on (gets retuned to D#)<br/>Bird tweet (resets to no accidentals).</p><p>Then play it through FTS - either relay to FTS e.g. using Midi Yoke<br/>Junction, or else just save it as a midi file (format 0) and then play the<br/>midi file in FTS via Views | retuning midi player.</p><p>To use the option you need to select<br/>FTS | In | Options | Configure Midi Kbd | Notation for accidentals<br/>| Accidentals As | Midi patches (dft = sound effects).</p><p>It doesn&apos;t have to be an equal temperament - the Seashore<br/>patch will drop it down by one scale degree wherever the<br/>note is. E.g. you could use it in a just intonation scale<br/>to drop the 9/8 to a 10/9, and the telephone ring to raise<br/>a 5/4 to a 81/64 and a 4/3 to a 27/20 etc. You could do those<br/>particular ones by using the Modern Indian gamut as<br/>your just intonation twelve tone scale, and using it as<br/>a mode of the Indian Shruti scale</p><p>To do a chord you can place the notes in separate midi channels<br/>before retuning it in FTS</p><p>Or, do it like this:</p><p>C note on<br/>Seashore<br/>Eb note on (gets retuned to D#)<br/>Bird tweet (resets to no accidentals).<br/>C note off<br/>Eb note off<br/>...</p><p>That will sound a C, and a D# together.<br/>The C is unaffected by the Seashore patch accidental<br/>which happens after the C note on.</p><p>(So these sound effect patch accidentals<br/>don&apos;t work in the same way as midi pitch bends, which<br/>affect all notes in play - FTS takes care of the<br/>details to make that possible - by remapping the<br/>notes to other channels depending on the pitch bends<br/>needed).</p><p>If your midi sequencer won&apos;t let you set midi events in a particular<br/>order with zero delta time, you can save the midi file with<br/>the events in any order, e.g. as:</p><p>Seashore<br/>C note on<br/>Eb note on (gets retuned to D#)<br/>Bird tweet (resets to no accidentals).<br/>C note off<br/>Eb note off<br/>...<br/>then edit it in a hex editor to change the order of the<br/>events so that the Seashore patch is in the right place.</p><p>It is easy to find the Seashore patch if you use FTS to<br/>make the hex dump as it adds comments<br/>to the code, and so you just need to search the hex dump<br/>for &quot;Seashore&quot;, and there it is.</p><p>For more details see the help for<br/>FTS | Help | Midi In | Patches as accidentals.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
