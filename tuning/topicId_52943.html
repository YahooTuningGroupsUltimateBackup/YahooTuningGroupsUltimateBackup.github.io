He does<br/>sometimes label his notions speculative, but that often simply means<br/>they are one step beyond his usual lunacy. I wouldn&apos;t call it<br/>&quot;speculative&quot; to ponder the question of whether the Tetragrammaton,<br/>YHWH, might mean 5^10 * 6^5, since the letters are the 10th, 5th, 6th<br/>and 5th letters respectively of a Hebrew alphabet. That isn&apos;t<br/>speculative, it is simply incompetent; no one at that time would or<br/>even could have thought that way if they were intending to give a<br/>secret numerical meaning to YHWH.</p><p>However, it is when he claims things as facts, rather than<br/>speculation, that McClain is most obviously a crank. Near the<br/>beginning of the book, after discussing how Greek mathematics at the<br/>time of Plato was able to construct the cube root of two, which would<br/>also mean they could discuss the twelfth<br/>root of two, he writes this:</p><p>&lt;&lt;The necessity of tempering the *pure* intervals, defined by the<br/>ratios of the integers, is one of the great themes of Plato&apos;s<br/>Republic. In his allegorical form, &quot;citizens&quot; are modelled on the<br/>tones of of the scale which must not demand &quot;exactly what they are<br/>owed,&quot; but must keep in mind &quot;what is best for the city.&quot;&gt;&gt;</p><p>The claim that temperament is a theme of the Republic is, of course,<br/>entirely false, yet McClain states it as a fact, which unfortunately<br/>typifies his approach throughout the book. Not only is temperament not<br/>to be found in the Republic, it could not have been found there, as<br/>the Greeks did not know of it.</p><p>This isn&apos;t bad scholarship. Bad scholarship would be David Irving<br/>trying to show that the Holocaust, as such, did not happen, and<br/>twisting his facts in clever ways to do so. Irving is a bad scholar,<br/>but McClain is a crank, which is different, and his book should not be<br/>read from the point of view of expecting anything that he says about<br/>the Rg Veda, the Bible, or Plato to make any sense. It doesn&apos;t and<br/>won&apos;t. On the other hand, I think yantras are a nifty notion, and<br/>&quot;jubilee&quot; a fine name for the 50/49 comma.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2004 12:16:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Gene,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The claim that temperament is a theme of the Republic is,<br/>&gt; of course, entirely false, yet McClain states it as a fact,<br/>&gt; which unfortunately typifies his approach throughout the book.<br/>&gt; Not only is temperament not to be found in the Republic, it<br/>&gt; could not have been found there, as the Greeks did not know<br/>&gt; of it.</p><p>well, i&apos;m inclined to argue that point with you.</p><p>one of the most ancient musical text known, CBS 10996,<br/>a Babylonian tablet which clearly originates from Sumerian<br/>knowledge, describes a method of tuning the lyre which<br/>seems to involve temperament ... and in fact i belive that<br/>it is a sort of etude for the lyre.  the only way the<br/>piece, if that&apos;s what it is, can cycle back to the same<br/>notes it started with, is if it uses 12-tET.  here is<br/>my reconstruction of it:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/babylonian/cbs10996.mid">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/babylonian/cbs10996.mid</a></p><p>and i&apos;ve argued that any Sumerian scribe familiar with<br/>sexagesimal (base-60) math, could acheive a very close<br/>approximation to 12-tET:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumeriantuning.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumeriantuning.htm</a></p><p>if the Sumerians did it, and the Babylonians copied them<br/>(which they did in nearly every aspect of their culture),<br/>then it&apos;s not much of a stretch to believe that the ancient<br/>Greeks got this knowledge from Babylon.</p><p>most of my respect for McClain&apos;s work rests on my very<br/>deep study (summer of 2000) of the great acheivements of<br/>the Sumerians.</p><p>admittedly, i have not yet seen any &quot;concrete&quot; proof<br/>that the Greeks knew of temperament ... but my own<br/>research and speculations certainly lead me to agree<br/>with McClain.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2004 2:06:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; The claim that temperament is a theme of the Republic is,<br/>&gt; &gt; of course, entirely false, yet McClain states it as a fact,<br/>&gt; &gt; which unfortunately typifies his approach throughout the book.<br/>&gt; &gt; Not only is temperament not to be found in the Republic, it<br/>&gt; &gt; could not have been found there, as the Greeks did not know<br/>&gt; &gt; of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, i&apos;m inclined to argue that point with you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; one of the most ancient musical text known, CBS 10996,<br/>&gt; a Babylonian tablet which clearly originates from Sumerian<br/>&gt; knowledge, describes a method of tuning the lyre which<br/>&gt; seems to involve temperament ... and in fact i belive that<br/>&gt; it is a sort of etude for the lyre.</p><p>If the Babylonians knew temperament it would not mean the Greeks did.<br/>The closest we seem to get is in Aristoxenus, who by one<br/>interpretation wanted to temper out the Pythagorean comma, but<br/>Aristoxenus is against making anything precise--everything is supposed<br/>to have a built-in fuzz factor as I understand it.
