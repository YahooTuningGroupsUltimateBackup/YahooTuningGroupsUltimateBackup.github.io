Bang on a Can is trying to<br/>build up its national email list and is running a bunch of<br/>contests starting now on their site:<br/><a href="http://www.bangonacan.org">http://www.bangonacan.org</a>. The first contest is for a<br/>trip for two to London in May to see Bang on a Can<br/>play with Cecil Taylor. The odds are actually pretty<br/>good, since they are just starting to build the list<br/>(the have fewer than 1,000 people right now). The<br/>contest runs through March 31. Hope to see you there.<br/>Future contests will involve CD giveaways and<br/>other trips and stuff. They do not sell their list. Best, Aaron.</p></div>
