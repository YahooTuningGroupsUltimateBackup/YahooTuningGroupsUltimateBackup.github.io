I had mentioned this tuning specifically only<br/>because the thread had converged on Pythagorean, 17-tET, and<br/>consistency, and this tuning is oh so close to 17-tET, sets the 3/2<br/>pure, and (somewhat dramatically) increases consistency when compared<br/>to 17-tET proper.</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, ten steps make a pure 3:2 fifth</p><p>Yes, the way I look at this is as an equal division of the 3/2, i.e.,<br/>(LOG(2)-LOG(1))*(n/LOG(3/2)) where &quot;n&quot; in this case is 10. I&apos;ve posted<br/>quite a few of these types of scales in the past.</p><p>&gt; That augmented sixth in the first example has an effect similar and<br/>quite different -- one of the attractions of 17-tet.</p><p>Nice. Agreed!</p><p>Dan</p></div>
