Namely, that it serves as &gt; a predictive measure of the perception of a dyad, a chord, or of any &gt; sound at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea was put forth some time ago that many other things besides &gt; the harmonic entropy of the individual dyads of a chord affect the &gt; way the chord is perceived. To name one, the chords played before &gt; and after a chord will affect how the chord is perceived. Not only &gt; does this apply to triads and up, in which it is sometimes accepted &gt; that HE alone falls short, but it also applies to simple dyads as &gt; well. The musical context of an chord, the timbre that the chord is &gt; played with, and the interpolation between the intervals and a faux-&gt; harmonic series will all affect how the perceived. In addition, how &gt; FAMILIAR one is with an interval/chord will affect how it&apos;s &gt; perceived. Some of these things Paul addresses directly in his HE &gt; theory; some of them he mentions out of context, but does not &gt; address specifically within the theory; and some of the things he &gt; doesn&apos;t mention at all in his writings that I&apos;ve found.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To put things in perspective: Entropy, as it stands in information &gt; theory, is sort of a measure of &quot;disorder&quot; or &quot;novelty&quot; in a signal. &gt; The string &quot;1111222233334444&quot; has a lower entropy than the string &gt; &quot;816449362516941&quot;. Do you see how you immediately found the &gt; &quot;pattern&quot; or &quot;order&quot; in the first string? This principle, applied to &gt; psychoacoustic and physiological mechanisms in the ear and brain, is &gt; how the concept of harmonic entropy works as well. The second string &gt; is the concatenation of the squares from 9^2 down to 1^2, one right &gt; after the other. You might have found the order in that one, and you &gt; might not have. However, now that it&apos;s been shown to you, you&apos;re &gt; more likely to find it the next time you see it than you were &gt; before. The same also applies to harmonic entropy, and this latter &gt; part is often left out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The concept of Harmonic Entropy is a brilliant model that describes &gt; the physical and psychoacoustic interactions between the pitch &gt; resolution and the periodicity resolution mechanisms in the ear and &gt; brain. The output from those mechanisms, whether high or low &gt; entropy, eventually ends up in the cerebral cortex, which is another &gt; way of saying that it is perceived by you, the listener. So you are &gt; presented with either a relatively orderly or a relatively &gt; disorderly signal. After that signal appears in your consciousness, &gt; all sorts of higher-order mental functions process it immediately, &gt; before you are even able to focus on it. These processes very &gt; strongly contribute to your perception of the signal when all is &gt; said and done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonic Entropy models don&apos;t really determine the final perception &gt; of anything. Actually assigning the resultant of the model &gt; perceptual qualities such as that it will be perceived as &quot;mistuned&quot; &gt; or &quot;harsh&quot; or something similar is overstepping the boundaries of &gt; what the place and periodicity mechanisms in the brain are &gt; responsible for. Furthermore, it is an extremely rough estimate to &gt; say that &quot;high entropy&quot; will directly translate to &quot;out of tune.&quot; In &gt; order to actually describe what happens to create your actual &gt; perception of a chord, it is necessary to look at the picture not &gt; only from a neurological perspective, but from a psychological &gt; perspective as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In psychological terms, a &quot;schema&quot; is the set of associations that &gt; you have for a particular phenomenon. For example, think of a &gt; grapefruit. Whatever it is that comes to mind - that a grapefruit is &gt; slightly heavier than a baseball, is yellowish to orangeish, smells &gt; and tastes sour, can squirt in your eye, that it&apos;s called a &gt; &quot;grapefruit&quot; -- all of that is part of your schema for a grapefruit. &gt; And whatever you thought of when I just mentioned a &quot;baseball&quot; or &gt; &quot;sour&quot; is what your schemas for baseballs and sourness are. It is &gt; what those things ARE to you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonic Entropy models can&apos;t accurately predict if an interval will &gt; be perceived as an &quot;out of tune&quot; version of another interval because &gt; such a prediction would entail that a person will end up applying a &gt; schema for some general interval that they have (major third) to an &gt; incoming phenomenon (400 cent interval) and then treat that specific &gt; case as a &quot;wrong&quot; version of the original schema (major third that &gt; is too sharp). Attempting, with a purely psychoacoustic model, to &gt; predict the entire outcome of the process of cognition without &gt; taking into account what schemas an individual even has (what &gt; intervals they know), how open an individual is to creating new &gt; schemas, etc. is absurd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, it might be a pretty good estimate to assume that most people &gt; will have only one schema that encapsulates the 400-cent major third &gt; and the 386 one. And it&apos;s probably a decent guess to assume that if &gt; a perceptual signal of any type is extremely high entropy, that a &gt; fair amount of people will hear it as being discordant. But these &gt; are just guesses. And they often fall short, especially when you &gt; consider that humans have made it a point to find order in high-&gt; entropy signals for as long as we&apos;ve been on the earth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Humans increase their appreciation for music by finding the &gt; intuitive order in progressively higher entropy signals, whether &gt; harmonic or otherwise. This process is at least partly psychological &gt; in nature,and has to do with the building of new schemas. As nobody &gt; is really sure how the aural periodicity mechanism in the brain &gt; analyzes data, it is certainly possible that that mechanism&apos;s &gt; adapting and &quot;learning&quot; new ways of analysis helps to contribute to &gt; this process as well. However, regardless of how the specific &gt; process works, it is clear that over time humans do find patterns in &gt; high-entropy signals, thus decreasing theperceptual entropy of a &gt; signal as one becomes acclimated to it over time. This is how &gt; someone who is used to 12-tet builds schemas for new intervals, &gt; chords, and sounds, and in doing so gains an appreciation for &gt; microtonal music over time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having made sense of a high entropy chord is the difference between &gt; it being &quot;grating&quot; and &quot;complex.&quot; It&apos;s the difference between a 19-&gt; tet major third being &quot;mistuned&quot; and &quot;different.&quot; It&apos;s the &gt; difference between the tritone being &quot;The Devil&apos;s Interval (tm)&quot; and &gt; &quot;consonant.&quot; In fact, in addition to finding the order in a chord, &gt; the way a particular chord fits into a chord progression or into a &gt; larger overall context is another type of signal with its own entropy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If someone hears a chord or a harmonic progression that is &gt; completely foreign to them, that they have not yet &quot;made sense&quot; of, &gt; one option is for them could treat it by trying to force it into &gt; their existing schemas for music (often a musician&apos;s fallacy), which &gt; will lead them to actually hear it as being &quot;out of tune.&quot; &gt; Alternately, they could perhaps &quot;give up&quot; and not try to it at all. &gt; They will hear a completely discordant composition. It&apos;s like &gt; reading a book in English when the only language you speak is &gt; Chinese. And just like when you immerse yourself in another &gt; language, they will eventually find the &quot;order&quot; in the signal and &gt; start to hear that song as &quot;making sense&quot; eventually, in what I have &gt; termed the &quot;Chromosounds effect&quot; after Gene Ward Smith&apos;s composition &gt; of the same name. This is why a lot of people might not immediately &gt; like a certain microtonal composition - it would literally sound &gt; &quot;out of tune&quot; to them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That isn&apos;t to say that the concept of harmonic entropy is incorrect &gt; or useless. It is perfectly useful. It only describes the first half &gt; of a long and complicated process leading ultimately to cognition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some real life ways in which a model in which harmonic entropy alone &gt; is used to predict perceptual results breaks down:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) When I listened to a 9/7 supermajor third for the first time, I &gt; thought it was just a really sharp, out of tune major third. Now &gt; I&apos;ve started to hear how 9/7 functions as separate in its own right. &gt; I used to only have a schema for 5/4, and I tried to fit 9/7 into &gt; 5/4. Then I started to &quot;get used&quot; to the sound of 9/7 and now I hear &gt; it as a sound distinct from 5/4. On the other hand, I can still &gt; treat, musically, 9/7 as a sharp major third, and people will hear &gt; it as a major third - I&apos;m writing a composition now that basically &gt; does just that. So you can, via musical context, cause an interval &gt; to be treated with a different schema than it might be treated if &gt; heard alone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Those with perfect pitch have a very strong, very noticeable &gt; field of attraction around absolute pitch values that they are used &gt; to (in this case, the notes of 12tet for me). For that example &gt; posted in the other thread, where 4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11 is compressed so &gt; that 11/4 becomes 8/3, I can either hear it as 11/4 on the outside, &gt; or as a C to an F an octave up. If I focus on the sound of the &gt; chord, I hear an otonal octad with 11/4, and if I focus on the outer &gt; notes, I hear C-F, which to me is a perfect fourth, having its own &gt; properties, and so forth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are a few unresolved questions here, namely how much of the &gt; learning of a new sound is an adaptation on the part of the &gt; periodicity mechanism and how much is simple &quot;classical&quot; schematic &gt; learning. It must be a little of both, I think, as the schema you &gt; have for an interval might determine whether a chord that you hear &gt; is &quot;annoying&quot; or &quot;exciting,&quot; but whether you can even make sense of &gt; that chord at all must have something to do with the periodicity &gt; mechanism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Charles Lucy<br/>lucy@...</p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=77585 href="#77585">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2008 11:40:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes Mike, very perceptive assessment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It makes sense to me, and may explain why Carl and others who<br/>&gt; are &quot;tone-deaf&quot; to LucyTuning</p><p>Charles, I would like to remind you that you&apos;re making a public<br/>statement about me.

He refers to<br/>it as &quot;the simplest possible model that takes in only one factor&quot; to<br/>answer the question &quot;how confused is my brain when it hears a certain<br/>interval?&quot; His models assume that the ability to make sense of<br/>intervals up to numerator N are the same for all intervals, or at<br/>least follow a pattern that has nothing to do with the familiarity of<br/>the interval. And his models also assume that we&apos;re dealing with the<br/>response of a &quot;typical listener.&quot; So these are a lot of assumptions to<br/>make, especially when you think about the fact that a &quot;typical<br/>listener&quot; could mean someone who grew up on 12-tet, it could mean<br/>someone who grew up in Indonesia listening to Gamelan music, it could<br/>mean someone who grew up in 1/4 comma meantone era, or it could mean<br/>the typical microtonal listener who is not akin to only hearing 9/7 as<br/>a really sharp major third. I don&apos;t doubt that Paul wasn&apos;t aware of<br/>these limitations.</p><p>I&apos;m just trying to study the next step in the process and elucidate<br/>exactly how it works. Why it is that some people hear microtonal music<br/>as &quot;out of tune&quot; and why some people hear don&apos;t? The answer I propose<br/>is that it has to do with learning, and is based on the schemata that<br/>one has for an interval, a chord or a sound. A musician will have much<br/>more complex schemata for intervals than a non-musician, who may only<br/>have schemata representing how the interval might function in a song<br/>they remember or a general musical context. But regardless, until<br/>someone hears a mindblowing piece that uses all sorts of<br/>higher-odd-limit septimal chords, melodies and intervals as<br/>intuitively and fluidly as western music has been using 5-limit ones<br/>for years, they are very likely to hear 9/7 as a sharp major third.<br/>Rothenburg&apos;s concept of how this applies to melodies is a brilliant<br/>application of the concept; I expect it would apply to intervals and<br/>chord structures as well.</p><p>I see a very strong connection between classical and modern theories<br/>of learning and the process by which one stops hearing 9/7 as an out<br/>of tune 5/4. I hypothesize that even the regions that are local maxima<br/>of harmonic entropy - such as around the 11/9 neutral third - can<br/>become as intuitive and consonant as 7/5 has in modern times. After<br/>all, 11/9 is a local maxima of harmonic entropy, but it doesn&apos;t have<br/>INFINITE entropy - which means that there is some order to the signal<br/>that the brain and mind could conceivably make sense of and hear in a<br/>musical context. This doesn&apos;t mean hearing the ambiguous neutral third<br/>in a musical context in which it functions ambiguously - it means<br/>hearing the neutral third as a rather complex consonance a la 7/5<br/>rather than hearing it as having no consonant value in its own right.</p><p>My comments weren&apos;t to attack Paul Erlich or Harmonic Entropy at all,<br/>nor were they really to attack anyone or anything in particular except<br/>for a vague notion I have felt emanating here and there that Harmonic<br/>Entropy can actually be used to predict high-level end result<br/>perceptions. Furthermore, if it paves the way for a broader discussion<br/>on how specifically some of these cognitive effects can be harnessed<br/>for musical and tuning purposes, I&apos;m happy. Also, I&apos;m sure that there<br/>are cognitive effects other than learning that play a role into this -<br/>one that Carl Lumma mentioned a long time ago are priming effects, in<br/>which (to use 12-tet terminology) an Eb-Bb dyad is played, and then a<br/>few seconds later a C-G dyad is played. The schema from the Eb-Bb dyad<br/>is still slightly activated and in your short term memory when the<br/>schema for the C-G dyad activates. Is there still a physical Eb-Bb<br/>dyad ringing in the auditory centers somewhere? Maybe, but this effect<br/>can be seen even if the Eb-Bb and C-G dyads are a considerable<br/>distance apart. The schema for Eb-Bb is activated slightly and so you<br/>will remember it later when you hear just C-G, which might remind you<br/>of a &quot;natural minor&quot; or perhaps even &quot;dorian&quot; tonality, as presumably<br/>those notes and root movements are part of the schema you have for<br/>that.</p><p>The question here is, is there an absolute cutoff for how long priming<br/>effects last in an individual, or is it dependent on the person? If<br/>someone has never heard dorian mode or minor before, will they still<br/>hear a &quot;minor quality&quot; to the sound? Is there even such a thing as a<br/>&quot;minor quality&quot; for that individual?</p><p>Would they build a new schema for minor just from hearing those two<br/>dyads activated separately, or would they first have to hear minor all<br/>by itself, triadically and such, to then later hear the C-G/Eb-Bb dyad<br/>pair as being minor?</p><p>Either way, this effect is pretty important, as if it weren&apos;t for this<br/>effect, there&apos;d be no such thing as tonality at all. And I expect the<br/>priming and learning effects are really only the tip of the iceberg<br/>with how deep this thread might run and apply to tuning theory and<br/>microtonal music, though for Carl&apos;s sake I&apos;ll stop short of declaring<br/>this to be a &quot;revolution in thinking&quot; :P</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77606 href="#77606">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2008 8:11:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>I included you because of your fondness for throwing theories in the<br/>trash rather than just recognising their limitations.

I<br/>think that what it is is that you build a map of all sorts of<br/>intervals based on stacking one of them. This is the principle behind<br/>a major 7 chord, major 9 chord, major 9 #11 chord, for example:</p><p>C E G B D F# A C# E G#, etc. forever.</p><p>It&apos;s basically that you take a CEG major chord, then you &quot;tile&quot; it up<br/>a fifth to GBD, etc., then up a fifth to DF#A, etc. The pattern of<br/>this chord is that it keeps getting extended by a perfect fifth.</p><p>The spiral of perfect fifths is a great example and generalization of<br/>this, as you can &quot;feel&quot; the relationship from each note to the next<br/>one in the circle. Chord progressions like:</p><p>Amaj Emaj Bmaj F#maj C#maj</p><p>sound particularly beautiful, especially if they are repeated - the<br/>motion from C#maj to Amaj can be heard as a motion by a pythagorean<br/>major third in its own right, rather than just as a motion by a<br/>stretched 5/4. The whole concept of Pythagorean tuning is based on<br/>your ability to feel the map of thirds out into even more remote<br/>intervals.</p><p>Here is a mental exercise tf ryou: If you imagine enough 3/2&apos;s in your<br/>head, and you imagine the 3/2&apos;s as they&apos;re played on a piano, you&apos;ll<br/>obviously end up back where you started, 12 octaves up. But if you go<br/>by what a 3/2 &quot;feels&quot; like to you, and you very slowly and carefully<br/>imagine 3/2&apos;s on top of each other, you WILL end up considerably<br/>sharper than the starting point. You can intuitively feel even that<br/>you will end up sharper than your starting point by about the distance<br/>of the Pythagorean comma if you pay enough attention, and you can feel<br/>where in 12-tet you suddenly &quot;switch&quot; to hearing any given point in<br/>the circle a Pythagorean comma down. Starting at C, when I get to D#,<br/>I suddenly hear it as Eb. There is an almost imperceptible shift in<br/>the way I feel the interval - I stop hearing it at around D# as an<br/>extension away from C and start to hear it as an Eb that is below C<br/>leading back to it. Not below in the octave sense, of course, but<br/>below in terms of the relation along the spiral of fifths.</p><p>So from this observation, you can note that even though in temperament<br/>things aren&apos;t just, the brain does somewhat treat things in relation<br/>to just intervals, (or maybe to the intervals in the timbre of the<br/>sound being played). I think that the brain builds/you build a &quot;map&quot;<br/>of the intervals that you&apos;re familiar with, and that&apos;s how you learn<br/>about tonality such as major or minor. It&apos;s also how when a piece<br/>moves from C major to G major, you hear that F# as a defining,<br/>contrasting note that signifies to you that something really different<br/>has occured: you have then &quot;learned&quot; something about the quality of<br/>the interval from C to an F# that is a whole tone and a major third<br/>up. Or, rather, you feel it as an &quot;extended&quot; interval - you might not<br/>be able to appreciate the consonance of 45/32 directly, but you do in<br/>fact feel it as a major third above the V chord of a root that is a<br/>modulation by 3/2 away from the root.</p><p>This is why quarter tones specifically often sound horribly &quot;wrong&quot; in<br/>a harmonic context at first - they&apos;re inaccessible. They haven&apos;t been<br/>mapped out yet. They don&apos;t fit into the circle of fifths in 12-tet,<br/>and the spiral of fifths for most people stops at the 12-tet circle.<br/>So they don&apos;t hear a motion by quarter tone as appearing anywhere in<br/>the spiral of fifths, although naturally it does (approximately). It<br/>also doesn&apos;t appear in any motion by major thirds, whole tones, or<br/>anything familiar. There might be certain quarter-tone motions that<br/>&quot;sound good anyway,&quot; like the one from C to an F half sharp, and then<br/>from that, one can hear from C to an E half sharp as that first<br/>interval minus a whole tone, and so quarter tones get mapped out.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that musicians often find one particular way to map<br/>an interval out and then cling to that as though it were the only way<br/>for it to exist - a lot of musicians treat a major third itself IS the<br/>interval that you get by going four fifths up; not only because they<br/>aren&apos;t familiar with the syntonic comma, but because they are clinging<br/>to what they already know.</p><p>In general, the three recipes to &quot;blow someone&apos;s mind&quot; musically seem<br/>to be the following:</p><p>1) Find a way to play an interval or chord or something that people<br/>somehow know about intuitively through their limited feeling out of<br/>the harmonic series, but does not exist in western music currently -<br/>right away they will hear this as sounding like &quot;a higher level of<br/>music&quot; rather than hearing it as &quot;weird and microtonal&quot;.<br/>2) Find a way to play an existing interval or chord in a way that<br/>shows people that there are other ways to use these intervals than the<br/>commonly accepted ones, I.E. put a major third on top of a minor chord<br/>for added resonance and let it ring. People will hear their familiar<br/>major third in a very new context.<br/>3) After exploring 1 and 2 for yourself for a long, long time, just<br/>freewrite and express an idea or create feelings that not only use<br/>these principles above, but do so in a way that is as expressive as<br/>the Beatles&apos; song &quot;Let it Be&quot; or the Debussy composition &quot;Reflections<br/>on the Water.&quot;</p><p>All of these principles not only seem intuitive, but have their basis<br/>in cognitive psychology as well, which maybe helps to show how<br/>incredibly useful combining these two fields can be.</p><p>A hypothesis of mine is that those with AP somehow &quot;remember&quot; these<br/>individual notes as being in a certain relation to some home pitch,<br/>but in a different sense than those with stored relative pitch can.<br/>For people with AP, C might be &quot;burned&quot; into the mind as the center of<br/>everything. And then when a new note is encountered, e.g. G 3/2 up<br/>from C, that note ALSO gets &quot;burned&quot; into the mind as well, whereas<br/>those that don&apos;t have AP do not have this effect stick into the long<br/>term memory; they might get just the one first note burned into the<br/>mind and then try to remember consciously everything from there.</p><p>Also, Charles...<br/>Another thing that I have been realizing as of late is that just like<br/>there is a spiral of 3/2 perfect fifths that leads to remote and<br/>beautiful harmonic arrangements, you can also construct a spiral of<br/>5/4 major thirds, a spiral of 7/4 harmonic sevenths, and so on. Each<br/>one of these spirals has a different feeling than the last one,<br/>especially the major thirds one, which is considerably more dissonant<br/>and complex than the 3/2 one. In LucyTuning, the 5/4 spiral will be<br/>intrinsically related to the 3/2 one, as it&apos;s a meantone temperament,<br/>but I would experiment with the 5/4 spiral as well just to see what<br/>musical results you get out of it!</p><p>Synaesthetically speaking, the 3/2 spiral to me sounds like a<br/>construction &quot;on top&quot; of something, as though you are moving up in<br/>fifths stacked on top of each other, but the 5/4 spiral sounds like<br/>you&apos;re moving &quot;forward.&quot; It&apos;s like going &quot;into&quot; the scene, moving<br/>behind the image of the note to something diagonally up and behind it.<br/>And I haven&apos;t gotten into the 7/4 spiral yet, but I imagine that that<br/>would be perceived as a fourth degree of freedom. So whoever says you<br/>can&apos;t imagine the fourth dimension might just need to go listen to the<br/>7/4 spiral for a bit.</p><p>Again, in terms of how this relates to LucyTuning, it is true that 4<br/>fourths equals a major third, but if you try and hear it as its own<br/>separate interval that stands by itself, you&apos;ll hear the depths of the<br/>spiral of thirds and such. I&apos;m trying to figure out if there are modes<br/>and scales that incorporate motions by the spiral of thirds as well -<br/>here&apos;s what I&apos;ve found.</p><p>The modes you&apos;ve listed on your site, from locrian to lydian (and as<br/>you&apos;ve noticed, there are more), all have one thing in common from a<br/>non-meantone perspective: In the 5-limit JI lattice, they go out into<br/>the 3-direction a few times, and the 5-direction no more than ONE<br/>EXCURSION OUT. This is equivalent to saying they contain two steps in<br/>the spiral of thirds: the step from C-E is equivalent to the step from<br/>G-B, as they are simply separated by a fifth.</p><p>All of the melodic minor modes, on the other hand, contain exactly<br/>THREE levels along the 5-axis: that is, they go two excursions out<br/>into the 5-direction. Take this scale, loosely described in 12-tet<br/>notation:</p><p>C D E F# G# A B C</p><p>That G# can be used as a 25/16 from C, which gives the parent scale a<br/>completely different sound than the diatonic parent scale. The modes<br/>of the harmonic minor and major scales are similar as well. Take this<br/>one, for instance, Lydian #2:</p><p>C D# E F# G A B C</p><p>One way to get from that C to the D# is as follows:</p><p>C-&gt;E-&gt;B-&gt;D#</p><p>So it&apos;s a motion by 5/4, a 3/2, and another 5/4. Alternatively, in<br/>12-tet, you might hear that C-D# as a C-Eb, so it depends on how<br/>you&apos;re mapping that interval out in any given musical context. This<br/>scale, Lydian Augmented #2:</p><p>C D# E F# G# A B C</p><p>Introduces another 5-limit way to get to that D#, namely C-&gt;E-&gt;G#-&gt;D#.</p><p>So this might be the concept of a LucyTuned or meantone spiral of<br/>fifths can be extended to other intervals as well.</p><p>An interesting question posed here is, if the diatonic modes can be<br/>generated as a stack of meantone fifths, what properties would scales<br/>based on a magic temperament spiral of major thirds have?

A lot of the ideas I&apos;d been putting out in<br/>this thread seem to be already described in that article. Which I very<br/>much like.</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t cultures that use neutral thirds use them primarily melodically,<br/>&gt; not in vertical harmony? If so, I don&apos;t think anyone would expect<br/>&gt; Harmonic Entropy to be relevant. And if they are used harmonically, or<br/>&gt; against a drone, then isn&apos;t their very balancing between 5:6 and 4:5 a<br/>&gt; possible explanation for their relative stability?</p><p>This question is equivalent to the question of how much of the<br/>learning process of interval recognition is cognitive in nature and<br/>how much is part of the periodicity mechanism or some other<br/>subconscious feature adapting to more efficiently process new sounds.<br/>It&apos;s equivalent to the question: &quot;does the part of the brain that<br/>processes incoming harmonic information have a fixed efficiency rate,<br/>or an adaptable efficiency rate?&quot; As I have seen in myself a strong<br/>tendency to start to hear 9/7 as its own interval with its own<br/>&quot;sound,&quot; and not just a sharp 5/4, I strongly suspect it actually DOES<br/>have something to do with an increase in pitch discrimination in<br/>certain interval areas. If not, I would simply hear 9/7 as a sharp<br/>5/4, and that is what 9/7 would BECOME to me, just as 11/9 would<br/>become &quot;the ambiguous third&quot; people of those cultures. But, from my<br/>own experience, although 9/7 can serve as a sharp major third, it can<br/>also serve as 9/7, which suggests to me that there is some deeper<br/>process at work adapting to these intervals.right?</p><p>So it is certainly true that 11/9 could remain &quot;ambiguous&quot; and that<br/>that is what the actual interval could BECOME to them, i.e. that would<br/>be a part of their schema for it - but it is also certainly true that<br/>they might have found an intuitive use for 11/9 that is distinct from<br/>this ambiguity. Sort of how a minor third can have a lot of uses - in<br/>the blues it&apos;s often used to sound like a very flat major third, but<br/>sometimes also in the blues it&apos;s almost serving a 19/16 function over<br/>a 5/4, and it can also be used as simply minor, as an interval in its<br/>own right, so on and so on. I believe, although this is just my<br/>hypothesis, that the process by which intervallic recognition becomes<br/>easier may correlate specifically to a widening of pitch<br/>discrimination, or an altering of that &quot;s&quot;/sigma parameter, around<br/>certain intervals and areas which are most thoroughly explored<br/>musically. I&apos;d have to do listening tests before I could make that<br/>distinction though, and I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;d be able to objectively<br/>assess the harmonic entropy component while filtering out conscious<br/>distorting of the process and cognitive labeling and such, or exactly<br/>how that fits in.</p><p>The key here is understanding the function of the periodicity<br/>mechanism better, I think, and in a few of Paul&apos;s posts I see he has<br/>it labeled as &quot;not clearly understood.&quot; Maybe some research has been<br/>done since then that would elucidate the situation.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77681 href="#77681">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2008 10:10:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The key here is understanding the function of the periodicity<br/>&gt; mechanism better, I think, and in a few of Paul&apos;s posts I see he has<br/>&gt; it labeled as &quot;not clearly understood.&quot; Maybe some research has been<br/>&gt; done since then that would elucidate the situation.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what era you&apos;re reading from, but Paul found<br/>Peter Cariani&apos;s work circa 2000 I think (for instance<br/>&quot;Neurobiological Foundations for the Theory of Harmony in<br/>Western Tonal Music&quot;) and I&apos;ve done a lot more digging<br/>since then.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=77682 href="#77682">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2008 10:24:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is driving me nuts.

Paul doesn&apos;t say anything<br/>&gt; like this in the quote you gave, either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>OK, to name an example off of the top of my head, all of the talk<br/>about metastable intervals recently involved the assumption that they<br/>are perceptually ambiguous intervals. If by &quot;ambiguous&quot; people didn&apos;t<br/>mean &quot;perceptually ambiguous&quot; but rather meant &quot;precognitively<br/>ambiguous&quot; or something, then I have simply misunderstood what they&apos;re<br/>saying. However, from that conversation, I remember getting the vibe<br/>quite a few times that people often referred to these intervals as<br/>being &quot;ambiguous,&quot; and I am simply pointing out that they might also<br/>serve a unique function that is decidedly NOT &quot;ambiguous&quot; in nature,<br/>once the ear/brain system learns how to process those intervals.<br/>Somebody, might have been Dave, referred to them as new types of<br/>consonance, and I think he was right on with that.</p><p>To name another one, someone else mentioned a while ago that the ear<br/>interprets the minor third as an out of tune major third in a triad,<br/>and the justification used was in A minor, that since people still<br/>properly hear the A as the &quot;root&quot; of the chord, that that corresponds<br/>to hearing an &quot;A&quot; phantom fundamental and that the C is interpreted as<br/>an out of tune C#. Being as the same applies for an A-C interval by<br/>itself (which, if played alone, usually does sound like A minor with A<br/>as the root), I would expect the statement to translate over to purely<br/>dyadic harmonic entropy as well. This is an interesting theory, and<br/>the rationale sounds good, but it&apos;s an unfalsifiable statement.</p><p>Someone also referred to having a 4:5:6 chord with a 16/9 on top would<br/>sound like the 16/9 was essentially an out of tune 7/4. While this<br/>MIGHT be true for just the 16/9 dyad itself, it is certainly not true<br/>for the entire chord. In fact, in my experience, the 16/9 and 7/4<br/>dyads alone have completely different characters to me. When I first<br/>heard 7/4, I heard it as an out of tune 16/9, so that has something to<br/>say about how familiarity affects the strength of an interval&apos;s field<br/>of attraction.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ah, except I thought it was &quot;accordance.&quot; Either way, I<br/>&gt;&gt; find the term more appropriate than using consonance and<br/>&gt;&gt; dissonance, as both of those are perceptual qualities<br/>&gt;&gt; which as we&apos;ve been discussing are beyond the scope of<br/>&gt;&gt; how far harmonic entropy can really go.<br/>&gt; 1.

I think of consonance as<br/>though it is an entire spectrum of different sounds, some which are<br/>easy to grasp (&quot;more consonant&quot;, like major thirds and such) and some<br/>which are harder to grasp (&quot;less consonant&quot;, like 7/5 and such).<br/>&quot;Dissonance,&quot; as it&apos;s usually used historically, is used to describe<br/>sounds that people are unable to &quot;grasp&quot; (which may correspond to a<br/>failure of the periodicity and place mechanisms to process<br/>high-entropy information). A major third used to be considered a<br/>dissonance. A tritone used to be considered a dissonance. In jazz<br/>playing today, a b9 unless it&apos;s over the root is considered to be a<br/>dissonance. Some of the best music out there uses dissonant intervals<br/>in a decidedly dissonant way - i.e. it sounds unstable as part of its<br/>charm - and some of the best music shows you how sounds you previously<br/>thought to be dissonant are actually complex consonances and fit<br/>together in a certain way. So it has something to do with musical<br/>context, and consonant intervals can also be used in a way that sounds<br/>dissonant as well - such as serialistic music, for example.</p><p>However, within the context of information theory, I wouldn&apos;t be<br/>opposed to really only using the term &quot;accordance&quot; to represent the<br/>both of those (since you brought it up and I like the name now). After<br/>all, we are simply trying to evaluate how ordered the signal is, or<br/>how high the entropy is. To be honest, I would think the only actual<br/>term representing some kind of absolute descriptive value that we need<br/>to use is &quot;entropy.&quot; Concordance and discordance are just two terms to<br/>mention how relatively high or low the entropy is.</p><p>So you can say that a given interval might be more or less<br/>concordant/discordant than another interval, i.e. that a major third<br/>is more concordant than a neutral third, but to give different<br/>intervals absolute values such as &quot;concordant&quot; or &quot;discordant&quot; in and<br/>of themselves doesn&apos;t make much sense IMO.</p><p>Really I&apos;m starting to realize that it all boils down to that sigma<br/>parameter - if that parameter can vary across pitch space, then it<br/>might change quite a bit in a relatively short amount of time for a<br/>certain interval, making the precise nature of what these HE curves<br/>convey slightly more complicated than if it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Of course we now now that there is no level so low that it is<br/>&gt; not subject to top-down feedback (seeing as SOAEs can be heard<br/>&gt; and recorded from outside the ear!).</p><p>Can you explain what you mean by this?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77687 href="#77687">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2008 10:41:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a quantity used in many fields including thermodynamics,<br/>&gt; computer science, physics, biology, neuroscience, etc. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; usually expressed in units of nats or in bits.

But I agree with you that it doesn&apos;t have to,<br/>&gt; it can just be learned by repetition, and I expect Paul would agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan</p><p>Some more thoughts on this.</p><p>I was just writing in response to Margo&apos;s thread that when I come to<br/>perceive the relationship between two justly tuned intervals as being<br/>whole unto itself, I get a sense of &quot;depth&quot; to the interval. 3/2, and<br/>stacks of 3/2&apos;s, are much more shallow than 5/4, which sounds like<br/>it&apos;s going &quot;in&quot; more or &quot;back&quot; or &quot;deep&quot; or something. I<br/>synaesthetically perceive it to be the aural equivalent of the visual<br/>process by which the brain puts parallax imagery between two eyes<br/>together to form one three dimensional image. The distance by which<br/>the two images diverge correlates with the brain&apos;s propensity and<br/>ability to merge the two images into a cohesive, three dimensional<br/>whole. Similarly, the harmonic &quot;distance&quot; by which the two tones<br/>diverge correlates with the brain&apos;s propensity to merge the two tones<br/>together into a cohesive interval. I use the term distance here to<br/>mean in some kind of multi-dimensional JI space, and not distance in<br/>cents or in pitch.</p><p>So if I perceive my ability to place increasingly higher-limit<br/>harmonic intervals as an increase in awareness of &quot;depth,&quot; and as I<br/>perceive my ability to determine finer and finer pitch variations as<br/>an increase of resolution (as in a monitor), could it be that this<br/>sensation of depth is the actual experience of the periodicity<br/>mechanism working?</p><p>So a few questions I have from this observation:</p><p>1) Are there any models of harmonic entropy that incorporate a free<br/>variable that describes the ability of the periodicity mechanism to<br/>operate, as there is with the ability of the place mechanism? Is that<br/>what the &quot;N&quot; parameter is for?</p><p>and 2) has any experimentation ever been done on with having the sigma<br/>value vary across the pitch spectrum? I&apos;m thinking along the lines of<br/>having sigma &quot;peaks&quot; at 100, 200, 300 ... up to 1200 cents to simulate<br/>the harmonic entropy of an average listener who has been mainly<br/>exposed to 12-tet... Of course, some other intervals would likely be<br/>thrown in as well to make it really authentic, like perhaps some<br/>smaller peaks for the just intervals, like one at 7/4 and one at 350<br/>cents. I can already tell you that my pitch discrimination at around<br/>350 cents is much stronger than my pitch discrimination at 550/600<br/>cents, for example -- I sometimes get 550 and 600 cent intervals<br/>confused, especially if they&apos;re at the top of a chord (although<br/>considerably less so recently), but I rarely ever actually confuse 350<br/>for 400 cents.</p><p>It might be interesting to generate a sigma curve and multiply THAT<br/>into the equation rather than keeping sigma constant. You could plot a<br/>variety of the most common scales and intervals you&apos;ve heard and do<br/>some kind of regression analysis to get a sigma curve, then see if the<br/>result holds any resemblance to how you first heard microtonal music<br/>when you were previously only exposed to 12tet or whatever your<br/>background is. Might provide a decent model of how accordant music<br/>from other cultures will be to us and how accordant western music will<br/>be to those in other cultures. So we might be able to compute an HE<br/>&quot;map&quot; for a specific person this way.</p><p>It might also be interesting to see if there is an optimal level of<br/>harmonic entropy that makes intervals easiest to learn as well, as<br/>opposed to ones that are already learned and ones that might just<br/>sound like noise for quite a while until they are placed.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77706 href="#77706">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2008 3:56:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree.

As far as I can tell, middle second intervals roam the mujannab zone between 14:13 and 11:10. This is a region 37 cents wide. Then again, it is possible to broaden the zone and take 15:14 and 10:9 as the extremes. In that case, we acquire a zone that is 63 cents wide!</p><p>I conjecture that high prime limit and relatively simple integer ratios such as 14:13, 27:25, 13:12, 12:11, 35:32, 11:10, 54:49 are at play. Then again,  instead of middle seconds, we might be looking at neutral thirds, in which case, the performer could be searching for 17:14, 39:32, 11:9, 27:22, 16:13, 21:17 and 31:25.</p><p>So many ratios imply the necessity to temper pitches and represent diverse middle seconds as well as neutral thirds with few, yet, variagated microtones that are reasonably spaced. That is how I arrived at 79 MOS 159-tET. Check out page 95 of my doctorate dissertation. There, you will see how the 79-tone tuning approximates many RI intervals.</p><p>Oz.</p><p>On Jun 25, 2008, at 2:23 PM, Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks Oz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That certainly supports the idea that the cultural use of neutral<br/>&gt; thirds has little or nothing to do with the coincidence of 9th and<br/>&gt; 11th harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did say &quot;relative&quot; stability.

You might be<br/>&gt; able to build some really consonant scales that way.</p><p>The main property is that they have lots of small semitones.   The 7 note magic MOS has steps of a small semitone (approximating 25:24 but tempered to be even smaller) and a minor third (approximating 6:5).  That&apos;s very unbalanced which will cause problems, especially if you try to fit tunes from your head to it.  It&apos;s still possible to use it in music but so far nobody has.</p><p>My rule is that a magic scale shouldn&apos;t have two small semitones next to each other.  You can use such runs in music but you can always take one note out of the scale and then treat it as a chromaticism.  Scales should be a bit more stable.</p><p>If the MOS scales don&apos;t work out, then, another approach is to take a major triad and transpose it by major thirds. I&apos;ll use meantone notation because the magic comma isn&apos;t required.  So start with G-B-D and move it down a major third to get Eb-G-Bb.  Then move the G major up a major third and you have B-D#-F#.  The scale is</p><p>G Bb B D D# Eb F# G</p><p>D-D# and D#-Eb are both small semitones (1 step in 19-equal, both approximating 25:24 in magic).  So this breaks the rule I set above.  The solution is to take out the D#.  We don&apos;t need it because B major can be replaced with B minor or B supermajor (B-Eb-F# with B-Eb approximating 7:9).  That leaves us with a 6 note scale.</p><p>G Bb B D Eb F# G</p><p>There are two steps sizes that approximate 6:5 here: between (G and Bb) and (B and D).  Adding two notes then gives an 8 note scale with no steps larger than a subminor third:</p><p>G (Ab) Bb B (C) D Eb F# G</p><p>On a 5-limit lattice it looks like:</p><p>;          B---F#<br/>;         / \ /<br/>;   (C)--G---D<br/>;   / \ / \ /<br/>;(Ab)--Eb--Bb</p><p>With 225:224 tempered out that gives a full 9-limit tetrad on Ab.  That&apos;s the logic for using C and Ab instead of C# and A.  I leave the extra notes in parentheses because you can treat them as second class citizens if you think 8 notes is too many.  Write tunes based on the 6 note core and using C and Ab less frequently as passing notes or to reinforce the harmony.</p><p>Generally, I think magic scales have to be taken with a pinch of chromatic salt.  There&apos;s no point having all those notes and only using seven of them after all.</p><p>Another trick is that, if the scale has a big gap in it, you can write tunes smaller than an octave.  Then you can fill in the gap with transpositions.  This is different to the traditional idea of transposing scales, where new notes are interpreted as modifications of the old ones.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=77865 href="#77865">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2008 2:08:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;I think the theory of Maqam music and other &quot;ethnic&quot; genres around the<br/>world are much neglected by the alternative tuning list community.&quot;</p><p>I believe that this is far from the case.

It is also terrific that historical European temperaments are not viewed by members of this community as categorically applicable to world musics, though I admit that the proximity of the Ottoman court to the Western world did at a certain point render meantone temperaments, particularly the Telemann-Mozart methodology of 9 commas to the whole tone &amp; 55 commas to the octave, a valid basis for explaining the theory of maqams (as can be seen in the example of Antoine Murat). While I am not particularly fond of the definition &quot;Art Music&quot;, I shall venture to say that Western tonal common-practice music and maqam music of the Ottoman court, its periphery, and Turkish posterity are on a par as regards artistic refinement in such areas as rhythm, melody, texture and form.</p><p>You are right that the majority of documents on Middle Eastern music theory penned in Arabic, Persian and old Turkish are quite inaccessible to the majority of Anglophones, which probably renders my complaint falling flat on its face. I must also confess my limitations for not knowing Arabic, Persian or old Turkish script. My only advantage to other members is the inflation of modern Turkish literature on the subject of maqam music and translations of old works.</p><p>Nevertheless, I do not agree with your view on Islamic (or, as you put it, Islamicate) music theory not embracing Jews and Christians of the region. While it would be unthinkable in a Byzantine court or Papal district for a Muslim music practitioner to be tolerated, let alone be given high positions, the cultural atmosphere advocated by my religion gave birth to a civilization where even non-Muslims became part of the imperial community. The Caucasian traditions you speak of boast no seperate music theory that I know of until the advent of the Soviets and imposition of 12-tone parlance. The same goes for the Balkans. Tanburi Harutin, Dimitrie Kantemir, Hamparsum Limonjiyan are but a few of the distinguished names ratifying my claims. A single excursion into Armenian and Greek documents of 18th Century Turkey reveal that Armenians use the same perde names, instruments, maqams and forms that were popular among Turks.</p><p>The drawback you described can be overcome if objective scholarship is applied to the field.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>On Jun 30, 2008, at 12:08 PM, Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;I think the theory of Maqam music and other &quot;ethnic&quot; genres around &gt; the<br/>&gt; world are much neglected by the alternative tuning list community.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe that this is far from the case.
