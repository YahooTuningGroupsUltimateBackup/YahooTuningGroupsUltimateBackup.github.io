I was<br/>&gt; &gt; surprised but probably shouldn&apos;t have been.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob brings up a point which has interested me for years:  What makes a<br/>&gt; tuning system sound distinctly microtonal versus out of tune?  Alternately,<br/>&gt; what makes a tuning system sound microtonal and not just more in tune?  I<br/>&gt; have experimented with dozens of systems trying to come up with something<br/>&gt; that sounds &quot;new&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Examples:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Bartok violin concerto with the quartertones, the quartertones are<br/>&gt; hardly noticeable.  (but nice if you are paying really close attention)<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the point?  Just more work for the performer?</p><p>Like climbing a large mountain? &quot;Because it&apos;s there!&quot;</p><p>&gt; Robert Fripp&apos;s Johnny One Note solo on &quot;Starless&quot; kicks butt microtonally,<br/>&gt; and he&apos;s playing a 12TET instrument.</p><p>But when he starts bending notes, it&apos;s no longer 12tet! I&apos;ve got<br/>to admit that Fripp still seems to be coming from 12tet, the notes<br/>he&apos;s bending to seem a bit haphazard.</p><p>&gt; Ives quarter tone piano pieces sound microtonal, but mostly because he plays<br/>&gt; recognizable melodies and transposes them by quarter tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s music finds new consonances, and not just new dissonances or weird<br/>&gt; sounds.  He also has melodies with very small microtonal steps in them.<br/>&gt; (Think about some of the harmonic cannon lines)</p><p>Or even the parts where he talks in tune or any melody.</p><p>&gt; To me his music covers the<br/>&gt; gamut from more out of tune, to more in tune, to new and distinctly<br/>&gt; microtonal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most Indian music regularly uses notes 16 cents away from 12TET, and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; played over a drone, yet it usually doesn&apos;t sound microtonal.  It just<br/>&gt; sounds right, or in tune.</p><p>The north Indian (Hindustani) music sounds more microtonal<br/>than the southern (Carnatic) music does. I know this explains why<br/>I&apos;m so attracted to Hindustani classical.</p><p>&gt; Why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon Catler recently had me cut a neck for him where we added 7-limit Just<br/>&gt; frets to a 12TET guitar neck.  That sounded new and microtonal.  Maybe<br/>&gt; because of the strength of the 5-limit 12TET system against the purity of<br/>&gt; the occasional 7-limit JI note?</p><p>12 tone equal temperament is not a 5 limit ji system. It may<br/>be implied but a carrot is as close as a rabbit gets to a diamond.</p><p>The answer to this last example is that while 12tet implies<br/>5 limit ji - 12tet does not imply 7 limit ji. 7 limit ji is new territory<br/>beyond 5 limit.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n  N e t  R a d i o<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=4678 href="#4678">ðŸ”—</a>Dale Scott &#x3C;adelscott@xxxx.xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; The Bartok violin concerto with the quartertones, the quartertones are<br/>&gt;&gt; hardly noticeable.
