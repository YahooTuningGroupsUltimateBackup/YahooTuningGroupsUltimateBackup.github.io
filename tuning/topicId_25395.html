This can be written as a unison vector (4 -1) (if I<br/>have the correct notation), implying 3^4 * 5^-1, or 3*3*3*3/5 (ignoring<br/>factors of 2 since the most widely used scales are octave-equivalent).<br/>Meantone scales have a particular character, in part due to this unison<br/>vector, and I&apos;m wondering if unison vectors might be a good way to classify<br/>other kinds of scales.</p><p>Of course, the 32805/32768 schisma (8 1) is another unison vector that&apos;s<br/>associated with a family of similar-sounding scales. My recent experiments<br/>with retuning my piano solo &quot;Galticeran&quot; illustrated that 128/125 (0 -3) is<br/>another unison vector with harmonic implications. But there are others that<br/>I&apos;ve found in trying to classify scales by their structure. A small family<br/>of scales with 3 large and 4 small steps (L-s-s-L-s-L-s) shares the unison<br/>vector 25/24 (-1 2). On the other end of the spectrum, there&apos;s another tiny<br/>group of scales with 2 large and 5 small steps (s-L-s-s-L-s-s), with the<br/>unison vector 135/128 (3 1).</p><p>Finally, there&apos;s an interesting unison vector with 7-limit implications:<br/>64/63 (-2 0 -1). If you listen to the canons with 12, 15, 22, 27, 37, 42,<br/>49, and 59 equal steps to the octave (I added the 49-TET and 59-TET<br/>versions specifically because of this discovery), I think you&apos;ll find that<br/>the minor sevenths are nicely flat (because the fifths are sharp) and the<br/>overall flavor of the harmony suggests a 7-limit interpretation. This is<br/>something that might have escaped my attention if I hadn&apos;t been doing all<br/>the different retunings of the canon and noticed similarities in the<br/>character of the scales. I wouldn&apos;t have even considered writing anything<br/>for 42-, 49-, or 59-TET before this. I&apos;ve had some interest in 37-TET due<br/>to its excellent 11/8 and 13/8 approximations, but I hadn&apos;t considered that<br/>its relatively poor 3/2 might actually have an advantage.</p><p>My question is whether there might be some other unison vectors that could<br/>unify a number of other scales, in particular some of the near-just<br/>tunings, into a larger grouping. Is there a list of known &quot;interesting&quot;<br/>unison vectors anywhere?</p><p>Incidentally, after all this listening to retuned canons, I&apos;m now pretty<br/>sick of the General MIDI timbres on my sound card. I&apos;ve been seriously<br/>considering Csound for a while, since I&apos;ve used it before for simple tuning<br/>experiments and such, but I never had the patience to deal with learning to<br/>use it for real music. I&apos;ve been accustomed to the real-time feedback and<br/>editing convenience of MIDI. But sample playback is so limited compared to<br/>synthesis. Maybe I should start writing a few simple microtonal etudes in<br/>Csound and see how they come out.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2001 8:06:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if unison vectors might be a good way to classify<br/>&gt; other kinds of scales.</p><p>You bet!

All of these plus 6-TET, 7-TET, and 20-TET, have 25/24 as a unison<br/>vector. These are &quot;neutral third&quot; scales; with the 25/24 tempered out,<br/>there are no distinctions between sharps and flats. (The 24-TET canon uses<br/>the same scale structure, although 25/24 isn&apos;t a unison vector in 24-TET,<br/>but the best 24-TET tuning would just be 12-TET.)</p><p>The 2L+5s scales, with a 135/128 unison vector, are 9, 11, 16, and 23-TET.<br/>It&apos;s a bit surprising that 11-TET fits in here, but it clearly makes sense<br/>to group 9, 16, and 23-TET together. These three are the pelog-like scales,<br/>with small fifths, and (as the 135/128 unison vector implies) major thirds<br/>produced by a series of three ascending fourths rather than four fifths.</p><p>&gt;&gt; My question is whether there might be some other unison vectors that could<br/>&gt;&gt; unify a number of other scales, in particular some of the near-just<br/>&gt;&gt; tunings, into a larger grouping.

One<br/>cool think about this is that 2401:2400 comes out to a full semitone<br/>in 12-tET. This fact, combined with the fact that the progression<br/>repeats after every 7 chords and is thus metrically odd, combined to<br/>give Joseph Pehrson the impression that the progression never repeats<br/>itself! I helped Joseph learn to play this progression on his<br/>blackjack-tuned keyboard. In blackjack, one can write progressions<br/>that make use of the 2401:2400 commatic unison vector, the 225:224<br/>commatic unison vector, or any combination of the two (most notably<br/>1029:1024).</p><p>There is a vast field of unison vectors out there.

Like Herman has done in some of his warped canons.</p><p>Ok. I guess I could live with a term like &quot;remapped meantone&quot;. You<br/>could refer to e.g. a &quot;7:9:11 remapped 1/4 comma meantone&quot;. I would<br/>only consider this usage appropriate if the interval standing in for<br/>1:5 is always approximated by a chain of four of the interval<br/>replacing 1:3.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 6:44:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot;<br/>&lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Doesn&apos;t &quot;equitone&quot; do the job for you?</p><p>Margo, isn&apos;t &quot;equitone&quot; really<br/>restricted to scales which have a<br/>generator which is some sort of<br/>approximate &quot;fifth&quot;?</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 7:07:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;<br/>STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Or see the [5,4] Bohlen-Pierce scale posts I have made in the past<br/>&gt; which used the 2D unison vectors 118098/117649 and 343/324</p><p>How could even numbers get into<br/>the BP unison vectors?</p><p>BTW, see Bohlen&apos;s site for my PB<br/>analysis of his scales.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2001 2:01:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Doesn&apos;t &quot;equitone&quot; do the job for you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo, isn&apos;t &quot;equitone&quot; really<br/>&gt; restricted to scales which have a<br/>&gt; generator which is some sort of<br/>&gt; approximate &quot;fifth&quot;?</p><p>Yes.
