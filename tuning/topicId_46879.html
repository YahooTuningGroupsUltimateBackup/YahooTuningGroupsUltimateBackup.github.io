The vast majority of them are tuned that way<br/>today, but there is a growing move back towards the tunings that the piano<br/>evolved with, (known today as &quot;well-temperaments&quot;)</p><p> &gt;&gt;However... some tuners make the higher octaves a little too wide. They say<br/>this adds to the &quot;brilliance&quot;of the sound.I also know of a tuner who makes<br/>the lower octaves a little too wide, he says this makes cords sound better. Are<br/>great pianists known to have an opinion on this topic, and if they have, is<br/>there concensus ?&lt;&lt;</p><p>Rarely.  The great pianists usually are more concerned with unison clarity<br/>first, then possibly the octaves.  A highly stretched piano is less noticeable<br/>than one that isn&apos;t stretched enough, though.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A tuner has to memorize the beats of the fifths, but without instrumental<br/>help small errors are unavoidable.</p><p>  Most aural tuning is done by comparing the speed of minor thirds with major<br/>thirds,  usually in the 7-10 beat per second range, ( a pure fifth will have<br/>a lower m3 beating near the same as the upper M3, ie, when C-G is pure, the<br/>C-Eb beats at the same speed as the Eb-G, if you want an ET fifth, the M3 is<br/>slower).    This is far more accurate than comparing the speed of the fifths<br/>which in the middle of the piano beat less than once per second.   There are also<br/>valuable checks of comparing thirds to sixths.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Could it be that tuners have favorite keys that sound better than others ?<br/>&lt;&lt;</p><p>  Could be, but if they are intending ET, they can&apos;t afford to have<br/>favorites.</p><p>&gt;&gt;To what precision can a piano be tuned? I think the slip-stick effect will<br/>limit the smallest increment to which a string can be tuned .&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Broadcast quality tunings are usually within .2 cents of ideal.  On the<br/>unisons, sometimes closer.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And a last observation : I read many years ago in The Scientific American<br/>that the three strings tuned to the same note are a coupled vibration system<br/>which can be made sound longer if slightly mistuned. I can hardly believe it.</p><p>   This is the &apos;Weinreich&quot; effect.  The slight mistunings are required to<br/>achieve consistant unisons from note to note.  It is due more to the phase<br/>effects than anything else.  Rust and other considerations may play a part, but the<br/>same procedure for clear unisons holds true for brand new strings, also.  Look<br/>on the web for <a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/">http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/</a></p><p>Paul writes, inre stretching the octaves:</p><p>&gt;&gt; it also helps the octaves beat less. it&apos;s impossible to tune beatless</p><p>octaves on a piano, because of the inharmonicity, but stretching the</p><p>octaves can lower most of the audible beating rates. &lt;&lt;</p><p>    True, octaves will be beating at one or more of their coincident<br/>partials, but if one is consistant, the impression can be made of clean octaves.<br/>However, there is a cost. The farther octaves are stretched, the faster the<br/>thirds contained within them will be.  This can contribute to the sense of<br/>&quot;brilliance&quot; in ET.</p><p>&gt;&gt;typically, the</p><p>octaves are tuned by matching the second partial of the lower note to</p><p>the fundamental of the higher note in the upper register</p><p>(shorthand &quot;1:2&quot;); as one moves to lower and lower registers, one</p><p>uses higher and higher partials, moving through &quot;2:4&quot; to &quot;3:6&quot;</p><p>to &quot;4:8&quot; to &quot;5:10&quot; or even &quot;6:12&quot; in the extreme low register.&lt;&lt;</p><p>Octaves are often tuned as 2:1 octaves in the middle, but as you go up the<br/>scale, that size octave will start to sound flat.  We are often tuning 3:6<br/>octaves by the sixth octave going up.  Stretching the bass out will help the piano<br/>sound fuller,(by allowing the low end beating,which is very slow, in order to<br/>more closely align the high partials of the bass with the fundamentals of the<br/>middle section).   The decision is made by what the scaling  of the piano<br/>is,(the length and diameter of the strings) and the intonational tastes of the<br/>listener.</p><p> Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a>&quot;&gt;<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>: Six Degrees of Tonality&lt;/A&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=46898 href="#46898">ðŸ”—</a>Justin Weaver &#x3C;improvist@usa.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2003 8:59:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    Umm,  not all suppose that.
