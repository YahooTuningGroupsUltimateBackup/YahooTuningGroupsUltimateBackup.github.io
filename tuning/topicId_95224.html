You still<br/>want sharp major thirds, sharp 7/4&apos;s, etc?</p><p>Nah, I had this idea that I would write a partly serially-generated piece,<br/>partly not, and that the tuning would shift seamlessly back and forth between<br/>12EDO and something like JI.  The scale I posted today might fit the bill.</p><p>The other thing is that I want to keep thinking in terms of a 46-note per octave<br/>layout -- because that&apos;s the scale I&apos;ve been practicing on and off, and I want<br/>to keep getting better at it.  So I don&apos;t necessarily want to move on right now.</p><p>But I&apos;ve noticed that I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m happy with the minor third in 46EDO, and<br/>that tuning the row I&apos;m using for this piece in 46EDO just doesn&apos;t sound quite<br/>right to me.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example of a 12-tone &quot;chorale&quot; or array in which every vertical<br/>sonority is already in the series:</p><p>C..A..F..Ab.Eb.D..B..G..E..Bb.F#.C#.<br/>Bb.F#.C#.C..A..F..Ab.Eb.D..B..G..E..<br/>E..C..F#.Eb.B..Ab.G..D..F..C#.Bb.A..<br/>C#.Bb.A..E..C..F#.Eb.B..Ab.G..D..F..</p><p>This is a sort of abstract double cannon.  Each vertical is an 0,2,3,6, or 0148<br/>-- which are found in the series (F,Eb,D,B) &amp; (Eb,D,B,G)<br/>-- and the top two lines are retrograde inversions down a major third of the<br/>original series.  It would be a very slow background, with foreground<br/>elaboration.  Slow to give it a lot of time to sound.  Too fast and it would be<br/>too dissonant in effect.</p><p>Anyway, there are lots of minor thirds and triad structures and suggestions of<br/>octatonic chords.</p><p>I figured I would go by ear, and worse case, if I couldn&apos;t get something to<br/>sound right, I could fall back on 12EDO.</p><p>So the tuning/scale I posted today would accomplish that.</p><p>It would allow moving between 12EDO and overtone chords sharing the 1/1.</p><p>If I need to move to a different tonality than one based on 1/1, I can use pitch<br/>bend to put the whole 46-note scale on a different tuning-base.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking this way because, to my surprise, I couldn&apos;t get the following<br/>chord to sound right in 46 EDO:</p><p>in 12EDO terms:</p><p>Db0,Bb2,A3,E4.  It&apos;s not too dissonant.
