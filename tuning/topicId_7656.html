So far I have not been able to agree with this view, because I<br/>prefer to keep the diatonic notes which are used most often with the diatonic<br/>tonalities, as pure as possible in tuning.&quot;</p><p>(Rudolf Rasch, &quot;Does &apos;Well-Tempered&apos; Mean &apos;Equal-Tempered&apos;?&quot; in Bach, Handel<br/>and Scarlatti: Tercentary Essays, Peter Williams, ed., Cambridge: Cambridge<br/>University Press, 1985, pp. 392-445)</p><p>With 9 years left to his life, Werckmeister did not fully support ET.  Yet in<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s Harmonologie musica (1702) Rudolf Rasch has determined that<br/>there is &quot;a direct pleading for equal temperament, based on the possibilities<br/>of unlimited transposition and enharmonic changes.&quot;</p><p>Now, from my 1985 essay Bach&apos;s Tuning.  &quot;One problem with this interpretation<br/>is that all circular keyboard tunings are by definition, capable of<br/>&apos;unlimited transposition and enharmonic  changes.&apos;  In this sense, equal<br/>temperament fits well within the larger category of well-tempered tunings.</p><p>&quot;Werckmeister&apos;s last opus Musicalische Paradoxal-Discourse (1707) was<br/>published posthumously.  Based on Rasch&apos;s translated excerpts, it would<br/>appear that Werckmeister did indeed fully support equal temperament to the<br/>point of offering an apology &apos;for his earlier propaganda for unequal<br/>temperaments.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Mark Lindley wrote in his article &quot;Temperament&quot; for The New Grove Dictionary<br/>of Music and Musicians, Stanley Sadie, ed., pp. 665-666) of different<br/>circumstances.</p><p>&quot;Werckmeister&apos;s attitude at the end of his life is summarized in a book<br/>published posthumously (1707) where in effect he apologized for not having<br/>included equal temperament among the various circulating termperaments for<br/>which he had earlier published a monochord diagram.  (The incompetent<br/>engraver, he said, had complained about dividing the narrow space of a comma<br/>into 12 parts.)  He quite approved of equal temperament, yet was willing &apos;to<br/>have the diatonic 3rds left somewhat purer than the other, less often used<br/>ones&apos;, a procedure for which he had expressed clear preference in his earlier<br/>writings.&quot;</p><p>What I deduced back in &apos;85 and still believe for certain is that Werckmeister<br/>wrote about equal temperament usage with increasing frequency in his later<br/>years.  This need not be interpreted as a dogmatic insistence on equal<br/>temrpament.  Maybe the Rameau reversals colored the situation somewhat.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
