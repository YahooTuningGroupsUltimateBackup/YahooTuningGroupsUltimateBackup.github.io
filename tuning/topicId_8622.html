Sure, and also according to Forte, it can<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;substitute&quot; for a I. However, I much prefer Forte&apos;s description<br/> &gt;&gt; of the vi as &quot;dominant preparation&quot; since Pythagorean chain<br/> &gt;&gt; progressions such as I-vi-ii-V-I are so common...</p><p>[Joe Monzo TD 533:4]</p><p>   &gt;But others have pointed out the idea (valid for Riemann) that<br/>   &gt;&apos;normal&apos; progression was:</p><p>    &gt; from IV to V,<br/>     &gt;from V to I, and<br/>     &gt;from I to anywhere.</p><p>      &gt;This does not invalidate vi=I as a &apos;dominant preparation&apos;.</p><p>      &gt; I suppose maybe we just see the relationship between Riemann<br/>      &gt;and Forte differently; to me, Forte is simply an elaboration  of<br/>Riemann.</p><p>And the earlier post by Paul Erlich:</p><p> &gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 531.24]<br/>                 &gt;<br/>                 &gt;&gt; [Joe Pehrson]<br/>                 &gt;&gt; Obviously, Paul, your teacher was teaching Reimann and<br/>*not*<br/>                 &gt;&gt; Forte, since the definitions you mention are quite<br/>different<br/>                 &gt;&gt; from Forte&apos;s definitions and terminology shown above.<br/>                 &gt;<br/>                 &gt; [Paul]<br/>                 &gt; Not at all! As I see it, the two are virtually<br/>identical!</p><p>                 &gt;And with Paul on my side, I&apos;m feeling pretty confident...<br/>:)</p><p>&gt;[TD 535:18 Daniel Wolf]</p><p>&gt;The first I left as an open problem for theorists:  How well does a set of<br/>&gt;one dimensional functions (T,D,S) cover tonal motion over a two<br/>dimensional<br/>&gt;lattice? Are additional terms needed to cover motion by thirds? Or can<br/>&gt;motions by thirds be adequated described as modified T,D, or S functions?</p><p>In my post of TD 528:9, I expressed concern with the use of the Riemann<br/>classifications.  Tonic, including vi and iii as subsets, and subdominant<br/>including ii as a subset...</p><p>And, naturally, I preferred Forte, since that is the book that I read...<br/>:-)</p><p>However, now I&apos;m beginning to believe maybe I was on the right track almost<br/>by accident.  All of the V of V relationships I cited from Forte fit nicely<br/>into Riemann and are the same, as mentioned *both* by Paul Erlich and Joe<br/>Monzo above, oh and Jerry Eskelin too...</p><p>Yup.  Duh.</p><p>BUT, there still is apparently something &quot;unsatisfying&quot; in the &quot;triadic&quot;<br/>Riemann classifications concerning harmonic motion by thirds.  Maybe right<br/>idea, wrong examples...??</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
