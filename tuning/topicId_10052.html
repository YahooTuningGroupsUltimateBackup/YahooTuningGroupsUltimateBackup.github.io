You will recall that<br/>I&apos;m pretty content with &quot;grounding&quot; to 12-tET, though I know you<br/>disagree!  But I DO want to give the idea a try, when, if...</p><p>&gt;&quot;Tombeau&quot; is one of my all time favorites (not the orchestral version,<br/>&gt;though).</p><p>My sentiments as well, on both counts.  I listen to a CD I&apos;ve made of<br/>it, in seven, quite frequently.  Go Ravel!</p><p>I&apos;m also in love with the Brahms piano sonatas, which oddly aren&apos;t that<br/>well known in classical music (or perhaps I just haven&apos;t tripped across<br/>them before...).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=10064 href="#10064">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@idcomm.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2000 6:33:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;You will recall that I&apos;m pretty content with &quot;grounding&quot; to 12-tET,<br/>&gt;&gt;though I know you disagree!</p><p>[Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt;Well, for most 19th century music, it probably makes very little<br/>&gt;difference, while for most 16th-17th century music, coming up with an<br/>&gt;adaptive JI rendition, it could reduce the retuning motions by almost a<br/>&gt;factor of 3, since the grounding would be close to a 1/4-comma<br/>&gt;meantone tuning.</p><p>Your point has merit, though I would quibble that, though I&apos;m grounding<br/>to 12-tET, my method does also allow for sharp reduction in retuning<br/>motion by virtue of allowing retuning motion (reduction thereof) to<br/>fight against the grounding.</p><p>What do you think of Dave Keenan&apos;s strong objection, just before he left<br/>the list in April, referring to the idea of grounding to COFT values,<br/>(see <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/8232">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/8232</a>):</p><p>[Dave Keenan:]<br/>&gt;I thought it was kind of obvious. ... And wrong!</p><p>&gt;The whole idea that there are only 12 notes is wrong (in general). So<br/>&gt;how could it make sense to spring them to _any_ fixed set of 12.</p><p>In the Bach/Busoni piece, Dave focused on scale degree 3 (D#/Eb) and<br/>argued that a proper analysis of the piece would classify each scale<br/>degree 3 as one or the other, and ground them separately.</p><p>For the older-style pieces, which CAN successfully be played in extended<br/>meantone without experiencing a &quot;diesis pump&quot;, it would make sense to<br/>begin the analysis by mapping the piece onto extended meantone, thus<br/>differentiating as many notes as needed to be, perform a COFT (constant<br/>optimized fixed tuning) on all those notes (&gt;12), then do an adaptive JI<br/>calc grounded to those tunings.</p><p>Such a method doesn&apos;t appeal to me, however, simply because its scope is<br/>so limited: it falls to pieces when challenged with later works that DO<br/>have built-in diesis pumps.  I&apos;m still groping for the perfect answer,<br/>ideally one which satisfies all of the following:</p><p>   . One approach applies to pieces old and new, constrained and bold.</p><p>   . Drift is controlled.</p><p>   . Grounding is not artifically harsh or predisposed to a particular<br/>     tuning.</p><p>And grounding to 12 COFT&apos;d notes might just be the best that is possible<br/>within those constraints, Dave Keenan&apos;s objections notwithstanding.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
