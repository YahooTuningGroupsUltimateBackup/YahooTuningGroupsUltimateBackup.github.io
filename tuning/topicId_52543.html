This is what people of today<br/>have lost and need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily and<br/>mental ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from<br/>other worlds and nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which<br/>come in static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko<br/>(Donald L.

It has failed to understand that the world is not for the beholding. It<br/>is for the hearing. It is not legible, but audible. ... Music is a herald,<br/>for change is inscribed in noise faster than it transforms society. ...<br/>Listening to music is listening to all noise, realizing that its appropriation and<br/>control is a reflection of power, that is essentially political.&quot; - Jacques<br/>Attali, _Noise: The Political Economy of Music_</p><p>&quot;...Then out to the flaming stars...<br/>From then, eventually unshackle time,<br/>and traverse galaxies...&quot; - Lou Harrison</p></div><h3><a id=52548 href="#52548">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2004 7:49:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, czhang23@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_52543.html#52543">/tuning/topicId_52543.html#52543</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     And pretty much any of Jacky Ligon&apos;s work, but he - like Brian<br/>McLaren - no longer have interests in sharing their stuff via the<br/>internet (much less<br/>&gt; the list).</p><p>***That&apos;s too bad, since *nobody* is going to make a living selling<br/>contemporary music CDs... unless they are totally of a &quot;popular&quot;<br/>bend.

Aparently he had the<br/>&gt; full backing of Sony on this one, probably because of the second<br/>true<br/>&gt; fact noted below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is also a fact that the Ninth is an icon of Japanese culture.<br/>No<br/>&gt; Christmas-New Years holidays would be complete without festive<br/>&gt; performances of &quot;Daiku&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Nine&quot;. I&apos;ve heard a story<br/>&gt; that this goes back to a New Years radio broadcast of Daiku in<br/>&gt; December, 1945, which millions listened to and which became sort<br/>of<br/>&gt; anthem for renewed hope. In any case, here in the US we use it to<br/>&gt; sell diamonds and nostrums, but in Japan Daiku is special.</p><p>***Thanks for the cultural update, Gene.  I guess the rest should go<br/>on metatuning, although I must admit that the vocal quartet near the<br/>end of the Ninth always sounds a bit microtonal to me... :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=52580 href="#52580">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2004 1:07:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It may be funny, but it&apos;s true...</p><p>...and...</p><p>&gt; It is also a fact that the Ninth is an icon of Japanese culture.</p><p>Gene is absolutely correct on the above.
