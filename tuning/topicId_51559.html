But mapping from JI to<br/>pelogic would of course keep major major and minor minor, though<br/>perhaps leading to a less appealing result when remapping the<br/>diatonic scale than the other strategy.</p><p>So I think we need (just mean would enjoy, really) *two* pelogic<br/>versions . . . Now, does any other temperament generate its 5-limit<br/>triads in the same pattern as meantone: [..xx..x..] and [..x..xx..]<br/>but with a different generator?</p></div><h3><a id=51599 href="#51599">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2004 4:19:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 11 Jan 2004 22:20:41 -0000, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Hi Herman . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Been thinking, and it seems (though I may have missed a lot this<br/>&gt;weekend) that you were employing a different strategy for pelogic<br/>&gt;than for (all of?) the other temperaments on your page . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Am I correct that for all the other temperaments, you simply began<br/>&gt;with the piece in JI and mapped it to the corresponding pitches in<br/>&gt;the temperament?</p><p>That&apos;s true for most of them.

Else<br/>apologies.]</p><p>Yes, and it would maybe be helpful also to label which approach was used for<br/>each item on the page.</p><p>I also had a hunch when I looked at your page that more than one different<br/>approach was being used, but my hunch was less educated than Paul&apos;s.  The<br/>reason I bring it up is because my hunch was so loose and intuitive that I<br/>couldn&apos;t really learn much from it.  If things were notated a little more it<br/>might have actually helped me learn something.  Since this page is a<br/>potential gold mine for newbies, it might be valuable to annotate it a<br/>little more.</p><p>So then it would be helpful if each approach used were also described<br/>briefly on the page, sort of like Paul started to describe, but perhaps with<br/>a little more hand-holding on exactly how the mapping is done.  The means by<br/>which different inversi&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x4B1;are applied is also not clear to me.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
