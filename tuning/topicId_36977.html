A truly great composer. We featured him on our last concert.<br/>Fantastic stuff. One of the few &quot;Brits&quot; who could match musical wits<br/>with the best on the continent. Henry Purcell wasn&apos;t bad either...two<br/>English greats. It seems the English have trouble with great cuisine<br/>and great composers, but really glad these two made it through<br/>somehow.</p><p>Thanks for preserving the language and the quaint spellings. It took<br/>a while for the printing press to standardize spelling, and the<br/>result is the wonderfully consistent English orthography we enjoy<br/>today (LOL!). Guess that makes three things the English have had<br/>trouble handling successfully.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jdstarrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The preface to a book of songs by William Byrd, published in 1588.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reasons briefly set down by th&apos;auctor, to perswade every one to<br/>learne<br/>&gt; to sing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First it is a knowledge easely taught, and quickly learned where<br/>there<br/>&gt; is a good Master, and an apt Scoller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2.
