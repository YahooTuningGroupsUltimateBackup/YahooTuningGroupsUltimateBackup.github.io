There are often letters added to the ETs, like &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos; or &apos;p&apos;.<br/>My understanding is that &apos;p&apos; means &quot;use patent vals from this ET&quot;, while<br/>&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos; and &apos;d&apos; mean &quot;use the val for 2:1, 3:1, 5:1 and 7:1,<br/>resp., that is slightly worse than the patent val&quot;. Also, &apos;d&apos;, &apos;dd&apos; and<br/>&apos;ddd&apos; mean second-best, third-best and fourth-best approximation, resp.<br/>. Is this correct? If so, then what happens if the next-best<br/>approximation is ambigous, like with &quot;12a&quot;?</p><p>2) Quoted from <a href="http://x31eq.com/paradigm.html#keyuv">http://x31eq.com/paradigm.html#keyuv</a> :</p><p>&quot;A suitable set of unison vectors contains the same information as the<br/>mapping. There will usually be different unison vectors you could<br/>choose, the same way that there are different lists of numbers that<br/>could denote the mapping. We have mathematical algorithms to convert<br/>between mappings and sets of unison vectors so the two concepts are<br/>nearly equivalent.&quot;</p><p>Now there are some special cases, like 22&amp;84<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22%2684&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22%2684&limit=7</a>&gt;  (compare orwell =<br/>22&amp;31 &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_22&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_22&limit=7</a>&gt; ), or 12&amp;41&amp;50<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=12%2641%2650&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=12%2641%2650&limit=7</a>&gt;  (compare<br/>marvel = 19&amp;31&amp;41 &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=41_31_19&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=41_31_19&limit=7</a>&gt;<br/>).</p><p>According to the temperament finder, those temperaments have the same<br/>list of unison vectors as another temperament, but they don&apos;t share the<br/>same name. The mapping is not completely different (e.g. the octave<br/>generator 1\1 is replaced by 1\2), but different enough that (judging<br/>from my limited knowledge) I think it should be considered a different<br/>temperament.</p><p>So, does that mean a regular temperament is not fully defined by a list<br/>of unison vectors? Or maybe those examples aren&apos;t regular temperaments?<br/>Or, is there a bug in the temperament finder, and the list of unison<br/>vectors is computed incorrectly? Or should temperaments like 22&amp;84 be<br/>called &quot;orwell&quot;, despite the different mapping (and generators)?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>-Gedankenwelt</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2013 7:17:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Apr 20, 2013 at 9:58 AM, gedankenwelt94<br/>&lt;gedankenwelt94@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.)
