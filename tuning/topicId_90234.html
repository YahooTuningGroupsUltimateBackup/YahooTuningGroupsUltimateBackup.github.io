First, 19-EDO produces 1:3:5:7:9 chords with similar accuracy to 13-ED3.  Second, the Moment of Symmetry scales suggested as a basis for tonality in BP are based on an approximate 7:9, and 19-EDO&apos;s approximation of this interval works equally well as a generator for these scales, when 30 degrees of 19-EDO is used as a repeat-period.  The step sizes will be 2 degrees for the small size and 5 degrees for the large size, basically the 19-EDO diatonic semitone and minor third.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about you guys, but I think this is kind of a big deal!

But what makes it BP?<br/>&gt;<br/>Well, the good 1:3:5:7:9 harmonies, for one; the approximate-7:9-generator MOS scales for two.  In other words, anything written for BP as 13-ED3 could be played in 30-ED3, so it could also be played in 19-EDO (if 19-EDO is treated as 30-ED3).  Yes, in 19-EDO the tritave is tempered, but it&apos;s still certainly close enough to get the job done.  And on a 19-EDO guitar it wouldn&apos;t take much adjustment to stretch the intonation to make the tritave pure and the octave impure.</p></div><h3><a id=90245 href="#90245">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 3:00:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, the good 1:3:5:7:9 harmonies, for one; the approximate-7:9-generator MOS scales for two.</p><p>If that&apos;s all it takes to be Bohlen-Pierce, then squares temperament, which has a 9/7 generator and like 19 tempers out 81/80, is also Bohlen-Pierce. An 11/31 of an octave generator works for that, but once again you could stretch. As for 19 and 9/7 generators, that suggests sensi temperament; tune the generator to 17/46 and you are good to go for a sensi MOS of 19 notes.</p><p>If you want 9/7 generators with extreme accuracy, there&apos;s always supermajor, a microtemperament. Tune 80 notes to 62/171 and give Ozan&apos;s 80 note MOS some competition. Not sure how that works with your guitar, though.:)</p></div><h3><a id=90246 href="#90246">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 3:08:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, the good 1:3:5:7:9 harmonies, for one;<br/>&gt; the approximate-7:9-generator MOS scales for two.</p><p>I think the latter is even more important than the former since the 245/243 tempering is one of the characteristic properties of BP and the only way to get a 9-tone MOS.
