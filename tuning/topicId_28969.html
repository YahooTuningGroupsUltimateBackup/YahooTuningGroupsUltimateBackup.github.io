But it was a convenient<br/>method of reckoning, uses by many string and wind teachers in the<br/>18th century. The whole tone was reckoned as 9 steps, the diatonic<br/>semitone 5 steps, and the chromatic semitone 4 steps. Observing these<br/>specifications with some approximate accuracy would ensure &quot;correct<br/>intonation&quot; for the music of the time (though Beethoven and even a<br/>few Mozart passages with enharmonic modulation become problematic).</p><p>The 9, 5, and 4-step intervals would yield the usual notated notes<br/>with the following spacing:</p><p>C</p><p>C#<br/>Db</p><p>D</p><p>D#<br/>Eb</p><p>E<br/>Fb</p><p>E#<br/>F</p><p>F#<br/>Gb</p><p>G</p><p>G#<br/>Ab</p><p>A</p><p>A#<br/>Bb</p><p>B<br/>Cb</p><p>B#<br/>C</p><p>Filling in the gaps by using the same rules, extended to double<br/>sharps and flats, yields:</p><p>C<br/>Dbb</p><p>B##<br/>C#<br/>Db</p><p>C##<br/>D<br/>Ebb</p><p>D#<br/>Eb<br/>Fbb</p><p>D##<br/>E<br/>Fb</p><p>E#<br/>F<br/>Gbb</p><p>E##<br/>F#<br/>Gb</p><p>F##<br/>G<br/>Abb</p><p>G#<br/>Ab</p><p>G##<br/>A<br/>Bbb</p><p>A#<br/>Bb<br/>Cbb</p><p>A##<br/>B<br/>Cb</p><p>B#<br/>C</p><p>Adding triple sharps and triple flats:</p><p>C<br/>Dbb</p><p>B##<br/>C#<br/>Db<br/>Ebbb<br/>B###<br/>C##<br/>D<br/>Ebb<br/>Fbbb<br/>C###<br/>D#<br/>Eb<br/>Fbb</p><p>D##<br/>E<br/>Fb<br/>Gbbb<br/>D###<br/>E#<br/>F<br/>Gbb</p><p>E##<br/>F#<br/>Gb<br/>Abbb<br/>E###<br/>F##<br/>G<br/>Abb</p><p>F###<br/>G#<br/>Ab<br/>Bbbb</p><p>G##<br/>A<br/>Bbb<br/>Cbbb<br/>G###<br/>A#<br/>Bb<br/>Cbb</p><p>A##<br/>B<br/>Cb<br/>Dbbb<br/>A###<br/>B#<br/>C</p><p>This is how Telemann&apos;s 49 notated notes would lie according to the &quot;9<br/>parts per tone, 5 parts per diatonic semitone&quot; specification. Notice<br/>that there are 6 &quot;holes&quot;, which brings the total number of divisions<br/>to 55. I&apos;m not saying that Telemann&apos;s deathbed inscription in any way<br/>proves that he was thinking 55 -- only that there&apos;s isn&apos;t yet any<br/>sort of contradiction in my mind against Sorge&apos;s assertion.</p></div>
