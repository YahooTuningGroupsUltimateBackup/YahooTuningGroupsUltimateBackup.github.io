A friend of mine<br/>lives in a house he and his wife built, in the wilderness, on<br/>solar and hydro-electric power.  They raised a child there.  Paul<br/>Vandervoort, a professional Halberstadt artist, taught himself to<br/>play the Janko keyboard.  Now he plays both professionally.  Cool<br/>things can happen when people put their minds to it.</p><p>&gt;Even great music written in conventional ways with conventional<br/>&gt;instruments remains in the fringe.</p><p>Not for long, usually.  History seems to have done well in this<br/>regard.  Even in contemporary music, poor artists sometimes make<br/>it to the top, but the best artists almost always make it to the<br/>top (example: Phish).</p><p>&gt;My view is to write great music with instruments which can be<br/>&gt;adapted for the purpose, without disturbing too greatly the<br/>&gt;technique of the performer.</p><p>Well, there&apos;s certainly several lifetimes of work on this path,<br/>and you won&apos;t get anything but encouragement from me!!</p><p>However, please don&apos;t diss the more radical path.  See, I&apos;m<br/>claiming that the design of an instrument inspires music in<br/>some deep way.  Instruments are tools for coming up with things<br/>you wouldn&apos;t have otherwise.  Manuscript paper itself can be<br/>an instrument in this respect.  But consider that a great number<br/>of history&apos;s most celebrated composers were first and foremost<br/>keyboardists (Bach, Beethoven).  This changed in the last century<br/>when specializing in playing became a living.  But almost all<br/>composers work at the piano at some point.  And arguably, the<br/>defining instrument of the last century of musical innovation has<br/>been the guitar...</p><p>You will, of course, be able to write plenty of strapping-good<br/>music by remapping the Halberstadt, using more than one<br/>Halberstadt at a time, etc.  But my point is, there&apos;s a class of<br/>new music you won&apos;t be able to write on paper for somebody else<br/>to play -- you&apos;ll have to learn the new keyboard yourself.</p><p>This more utopian approach can make the new instruments take off,<br/>too.  Beethoven essentially invented the piano in this way, I&apos;ll<br/>argue.  It had a familiar keyboard, but it was certainly capable<br/>of things the harpsichord, organ, and clavichord were not!</p><p>I understand the world&apos;s best musical saw player (by far) is some<br/>guy from Brazil who bought a &apos;learn the musical saw&apos; instructional<br/>video and practiced often.</p><p>The world&apos;s best checkers player (by far) beat all computer<br/>checkers programs until his recent death, and was the only human<br/>who could do so.

It took a little time (~ a week or<br/>two) to adapt to some of these, but once this was done I found that<br/>it was no problem to go from one to the other, so long as I played<br/>them regularly.
