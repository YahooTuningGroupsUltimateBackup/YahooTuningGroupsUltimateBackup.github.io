The same type of thing happens in the<br/>electrical domain (as opposed to the acounstical) in a radio receiver design<br/>called a superhetrodyne.  The received signal is mixed with a constant<br/>frequency local oscillator in a non-linear circuit, and the resulting<br/>difference frequency (called the intermediate frequency) is then amplified.</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p><p>____________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a href="http://webmail.netscape.com">http://webmail.netscape.com</a>.</p></div><h3><a id=6025 href="#6025">ðŸ”—</a>robert grimble &#x3C;cthulhu@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/1999 6:41:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fred ---</p><p>I understand the concenpt of the difference tones.</p><p>However, the effect I am speaking about is a little more complex.</p><p>If your ear would &quot;hear&quot; the difference tone of two notes, then a slight<br/>mistuning would not suppress the effect;  i.e., if you played something<br/>that was almost a 2:3 fifth (for argument&apos;s sake, lets say it is a<br/>2:3.001), you would hear a tone that is very close the the &quot;1&quot; -- 1.001 in<br/>that example.</p><p>In practice, when the 2:3 interval is hit, you suddenly get another effect<br/>where what you perceive is a a very pure note below the two notes actually<br/>played.</p><p>As I say, it is a really startling effect, at least to me.
