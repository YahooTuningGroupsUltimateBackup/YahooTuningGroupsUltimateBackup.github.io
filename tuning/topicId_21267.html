Additionally, cents allows for<br/>the total intellectualization of all pitch &quot;points&quot; on the line of<br/>frequency to be immediately apprehended.  Most importantly, players<br/>always reference new pitches to constants -- like open strings and<br/>harmonics --  in order to find exotics.  Microtonal notations that<br/>represent moving relationships can lose their constants in pitch<br/>drift, making it difficult to come up with the necessary hand<br/>positions or fingerings to produce the appropriate sounds.  The<br/>solution is for all pitches to relate in a unified field in order to<br/>be fully prescriptive for players.   Cents also anchors us to present<br/>music tradition -- no small feat.  Of course, by using enharmonic<br/>quartertones, one need not use numbers larger than 25 to indicate<br/>cents distinctions (recently pointed out by Paul Erlich, a<br/>subscriber to the internet&apos;s busy Tuning List).&quot;</p><p>_________ ______ ___ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
