Paul Erlich was in the camp<br/>that read Aristoxenus as an equal-temperer, while I read him as one of the<br/>first cognitive scientists, with his units being conceptual units with<br/>absolute measure, akin to Indian srutis, which were also later reinterpreted<br/>as having exact sizes (Partch tries to make fun of this on pp. 372-3 of<br/>_Genesis_).</p></div>
