I&apos;m not using a chord list per se; rather, each set of sounding<br/>&gt;&gt;notes tries to fit itself to one of the tuning files loaded, in each<br/>&gt;&gt;of the possible 12 keys the file can be transposed to.</p><p>[Carl Lumma, TD 496.4:]<br/>&gt;You&apos;ve got to have something that pairs 12-tone chords with just ones.<br/>&gt;The question is, do you consider all just verions equally consonant?</p><p>No, I don&apos;t.  My just7.tun, for example, tunes C to 0.00 cents deviation<br/>from 12-tET, and tunes E -13.69 cents from 12-tET, thus forming an<br/>exact 4:5 from C, and rates that ratio as &quot;+32 goodness units&quot;, where<br/>&quot;goodness units&quot; are arbitrarily defined, scale-adjusted by trial and<br/>error.  The same file tunes Bb as -31.16 cents from 12-tET, so that it<br/>forms a 7:9 interval against D (tuned +3.91 cents from 12-tET), and it<br/>rates that interval as &quot;0 goodness units&quot;, in other words, it is less<br/>favored if all you&apos;re playing is a major third.  But when playing a<br/>dom7, the program tries all alignments with the just7.tun file, summing<br/>the goodness for all the intervals formed, and finds that the best<br/>alignment comes when the 7:9 is tuned, well, as 7:9.</p><p>I use the same pre-processing before going into the spring world, as I<br/>did before the program HAD springs.  Then I wire the ideal interval of<br/>each spring to match the tuning file selected previously.  Having<br/>selected a 4:5 spring in one place and a 7:9 spring in another, I don&apos;t<br/>at present modify the spring constants based upon the interval; EXCEPT<br/>that I have some slightly kludgy code that relaxes the spring constants<br/>of 5-limit tritones (since from what people on the list say, having a<br/>dissonant tritone is considered desirable in 5-limit, the opposite of<br/>7-limit).</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;What if I didn&apos;t want to zero from 12-tet?  What if I consider meantone<br/>&gt;ideal?  12 zaps the pythagorean and syntonic commas, but say I want to<br/>&gt;keep the pythagorean comma?  Would it be difficult to let the user<br/>&gt;specify the ideal case in a file?  In general could this be done for<br/>&gt;for all deviations, not just horizontal motion?</p><p>Paul E&apos;s idea of floating all but one pitch12 is one approach to this,<br/>but I think you&apos;re asking for more.  I&apos;m not sure how to &quot;keep the<br/>pythagorean comma&quot;, without having the program explicitly follow the<br/>modulations of the piece, which would be possible, though it&apos;s not<br/>something I&apos;m doing now.</p><p>I&apos;ve done some more reading of your &quot;adaptive.txt&quot;, and I have some<br/>questions.  Your idea of having a lookup table that has complete chords,<br/>as opposed to my tuning tables which accommodate all chords &quot;at once&quot;,<br/>would seem to have both strengths and weaknesses.  It&apos;s stronger in that<br/>in theory you could provide more tuning possibilities (you&apos;ve mentioned<br/>going up to 19, where, for me, even 11 is a stretch).  Weaker, in that<br/>I see the number of chords you would need expanding rapidly in real-<br/>life.  What, for example, do you plan to do when two successive chords<br/>overlap slightly?  One option, which in fact I do, is to seek out such<br/>overlaps, evaluate them for duration, and essentially throw away the<br/>very brief complex chords formed when they don&apos;t last longer than some<br/>preset time, which I typically set to 64 msec.</p><p>Do you plan to have any chords actually tuned to 12-tET?  You know the<br/>typical examples: augmented triads, full diminished tetrads, and strings<br/>of four or more notes connected by fifths.</p><p>Depending upon your answer to that, how does volume of notes come into<br/>play?  For example, suppose I play C and E very loudly, but then play<br/>G# very softly?  This is sort of an augmented triad, sort of not.</p><p>What is your thought about considering the duration of chords?  If I<br/>play a chord for a very brief length of time, should it have as much<br/>pull on tuning as a long sustained chord?</p><p>How will you handle drift?  The ol&apos; comma pump, repeated many times?</p><p>Will you consider the length of time between chords?  Two conflicting<br/>chords back-to-back vs. separated by a long silence, say.</p><p>In your scheme, can chords, or the notes within them, interact when<br/>something else intervenes?  If there are three successive chords, and<br/>only the outer two have a C, say, will the two C&apos;s consider their<br/>relative tuning?</p><p>When you refer to &quot;ticks&quot; in a MIDI file, what does this mean?  I&apos;m<br/>aware of the MIDI time scheme, but if nothing is changing, there&apos;s<br/>nothing to focus on, yes?</p><p>OK, that&apos;s enough for one posting!  I&apos;ll be glad to continue to dig into<br/>your scheme based on your response.  Let&apos;s keep it on-list, if nobody<br/>objects; I think others would be interested in what you&apos;re planning to<br/>do, and perhaps others will bring forth their own ideas.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=7939 href="#7939">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Busoni?), it<br/>became clear that my method was suffering because I made the 5-limit<br/>seventh degree 8/9 of the root above and tried hard to hold it there.<br/>That, of course, results in a dissonant tritone.  Since it&apos;s dissonant,<br/>it&apos;s pointless to hold it rigidly in space; that only makes sense for<br/>consonant notes.</p><p>In point of fact, I do also relax major and minor seconds in both<br/>5-limit and 7-limit.  The contrast between the two is the 7th degree:<br/>in 7-limit (where, as I once said, to a firestorm of protest, &quot;tuning<br/>really MEANS something&quot;), it&apos;s important to hold it about as tightly as,<br/>say, a 4:5.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
