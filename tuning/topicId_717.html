For those of you who didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have the privilege of hearing Joe Monzo speak at the April<br/>&gt; 2001 microtonal conference in Claremont CA, Joe is a superb<br/>&gt; public speaker.</p><p>Hi Brian,</p><p>Thanks very much for all the compliments you give me here.<br/>I&apos;m glad you got so much out of my Microfest lecture --<br/>I really put a lot of hard work into that one, and it&apos;s<br/>nice to know that it was appreciated.</p><p>&gt;       Here&apos;s a question for Joe Monzo... Call me dense, but I&apos;m still<br/>&gt; not clear on something you mentioned when you discussed the procedure<br/>&gt; you use to compose.</p><p>Well, I hope you enjoyed the joke I sent about this, honoring<br/>His Ultimate Holiness Arnold Schoenberg.    :)</p><p>But seriously now...</p><p>&gt;        Joe, do you hear a specific microtonal melody in your head,<br/>&gt; and then try to find the ptiches in ratio space? Or is the process<br/>&gt; interactive?  In otherwords, do you hear a kind of template, and then<br/>&gt; refine it (sort of like twisting a telescope into focus) as you move<br/>&gt; through ratio space?<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;          What I&apos;m interested in here is whether the process of<br/>&gt; working in ratio space is interactive, or wheter you have to wander<br/>&gt; through a forest of closely spaced pitches until you find ones that<br/>&gt; seem to match something that&apos;s already in your head.</p><p>As always, your metaphors are very imaginative.</p><p>This is probably going to seem like a bit of a cop-out, but the<br/>reason it&apos;s taken me several weeks to respond to this question is<br/>that I&apos;ve been thinking of how to answer it properly, and the<br/>only answer I can really give is that musical inspiration comes<br/>to me in a wide variety of different ways.  So I&apos;ll go into<br/>some detail about all of them.</p><p>Sometimes I hear a melody, a tune, and generally try to plug in<br/>the nearest 12-EDO pitches first to fix it in my memory before<br/>I forget it.  Usually (since about 1990) the tune has distinctive<br/>microtonal characteristics, and I try to fix these either as<br/>fractions of a Semitone, or as low-integer JI ratios, depending<br/>on how familiar either of those measurements are in specific<br/>contexts, or on what the harmonic background seems to be.</p><p>Often, the original inspiration comes from a chord progression<br/>I imagine.  This is almost always in terms of low-integer JI<br/>ratios, where I imagine the pitches being highlighted on a<br/>lattice as they sound in my mind, when I get an idea like this.</p><p>And perhaps most often of all, a distinctive rhythm, in the<br/>form of a drum-set pattern, will pop into my mind, and that<br/>will be the germ from which a piece is generated.  Often I<br/>actually start absent-mindedly tapping out the rhythm on<br/>some surface with my fingers without realizing I&apos;m doing it.</p><p>Then, there are other times when I&apos;m *really* inspired -- most<br/>often when I&apos;m extremely tired or otherwise only semi-conscious<br/>-- when entire symphonic episodes come to mind.  Unfortunately,<br/>these are the hardest to write down, mainly because these days<br/>they&apos;re always microtonal and I simply can&apos;t scribble down<br/>the ideas fast enough to catch them as they keep flowing.<br/>So usually in these cases I somehow force my memory to retain<br/>what I&apos;m thinking of, and it generally works pretty well.  Then<br/>eventually one day I start a MIDI-file for that idea, and<br/>everything gushes out.</p><p>There are still other methods.  My recent Bulgarian Choir piece<br/>was written entirely by drawing horizontal lines for pitch<br/>durations in my Cakewalk &quot;piano roll&quot; window.  And I just wrote<br/>a mantra piece (which Jacky Ligon will be engineering for me<br/>shortly, then I&apos;ll upload it) in which the tuning was specified<br/>by opening the pitch-bend window and drawing pitch-bend values<br/>by eye, and somewhat randomly, and the result is fantastic (I think).</p><p>Hope that gives you some idea of how I work.  I&apos;d be willing<br/>to try to examine these processes further and write more about them.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
