Since turkish music uses enough drones and pedal tones in more recent music , the idea of a meantone fifth doesn&apos;t sound right, just for this reason. or from worknig with a meantone system, does such a system seem to relate to  music of this area.<br/>In fact it turns it back on everyone east of them. 53 and subsets of it have been around for centuries thoughout this entire region. I cannot believe it didnt make it to turkey until recently.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 7         &gt;   Date: Mon, 13 Jun 2005 01:57:17 +0300<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ozanyarman@superonline.com">ozanyarman@superonline.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Re: 159 et<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You mean the recently sprouted Turkish school based on 53tET. Turkish Qanuns are lately prepared according to 60tET, with 100 cent semi-tones. I find it quite appalling that some people here don&apos;t even have the faintest idea as to what would sound right for Maqams.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;159 sounds appealing to me only because it is triple 53, and it would be a convincing argument in defense of my 79 MOS gamut.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The majority of Turkish musicians don&apos;t even know what size of a major whole tone they are dividing into 9 parts. Some even think, nay assert, that the pythagorean comma is the smallest audible interval. They really need to get their facts straight, or else, someone ought to show them the way to the moon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am personally against such macaronic attempts as &grave;9-commas per whole tone&grave; to justify biased theories that have no practical use in explaining musical genres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Cordially,<br/>&gt;Ozan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- &gt;  From: Gene Ward Smith &gt;  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &gt;  Sent: 11 Haziran 2005 Cumartesi 20:35 &gt;  Subject: [tuning] Re: 159 et<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt; Huh?
