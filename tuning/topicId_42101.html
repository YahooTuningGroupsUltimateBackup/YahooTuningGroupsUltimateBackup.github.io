Lou Harrison was on his way to a week of his music at Ohio<br/>&gt;State University when he succumbed.  Nearly his last act before<br/>&gt;departing his home in Aptos was to sign a score (4 pages) for<br/>&gt;auctioning at the OM Festival 9 exhibition. This was just one example<br/>&gt;of his many generosities to the music community.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Lou was a featured guest at OM 8 and OM 2 and was a beloved mentor<br/>&gt;and friend to hundreds of people on the West Coast.  He is<br/>&gt;irreplaceable in every way and our loss is indeed profound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We will plan to do some appropriate memorial to Lou in March at OM 9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Right now I&apos;m just numb from the shock.  Fortunately he didn&apos;t suffer<br/>&gt;long and was vigorous and active right up to the last minute.  He was<br/>&gt;just a magnificent, inspiring person in every way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Charles<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;X-Sender: <a href="mailto:leta@cats-po-1.ucsc.edu">leta@cats-po-1.ucsc.edu</a><br/>&gt;&gt;Date: Sun, 2 Feb 2003 22:04:48 -0800<br/>&gt;&gt;To: Charles Amirkhanian &lt;<a href="mailto:charles@artsplural.com">charles@artsplural.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;From: Leta Miller &lt;<a href="mailto:leta@cats.ucsc.edu">leta@cats.ucsc.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Subject: Lou&apos;s gone<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Hi Charles,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m writing to give you some terrible news. Lou died this evening. I<br/>&gt;&gt;don&apos;t have many details. All I know is that he was in Indianapolis<br/>&gt;&gt;on his way to Ohio for a festival of his music. He had been met in<br/>&gt;&gt;Chicago by some Ohio State students who were driving him to the<br/>&gt;&gt;festival. He collapsed as he got up to go to the restroom. I have no<br/>&gt;&gt;other details---whether it was a heart attack, stroke, or what. I<br/>&gt;&gt;just heard that he was gone. Right now I simply feel very empty,<br/>&gt;&gt;deprived of a great friend. It won&apos;t be the same without him.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Charles Hanson said it probably would be best if people didn&apos;t call<br/>&gt;&gt;him right away. He&apos;s dealing with all the details--cremation, will,<br/>&gt;&gt;estate, etc. Sending an email is fine, of course (<a href="mailto:trkbob@cruzio.com">trkbob@cruzio.com</a>)<br/>&gt;&gt;but he would prefer not to take calls for a few days. He told me<br/>&gt;&gt;he&apos;s planning to send out a more complete notice after he has<br/>&gt;&gt;details himself.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m sure Other Minds will want to do some kind of memorial. Let me<br/>&gt;&gt;know if I can help in any way. Perhaps give a short talk about Lou<br/>&gt;  &gt;or something. Whatever you need, feel free to call on me.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;Leta<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;------ End of Forwarded Message</p><p>--<br/>==========================================================================<br/>David B.
