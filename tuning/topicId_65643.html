Thanks.</p><p>Partch meant that when you hear, for example, a 12edo major third,<br/>your ear hears it as implying 5/4, rather than 14/11 or 19/15 or<br/>infinitely many other ratios, because although 5/4 is 14 cents off, it<br/>is a simpler, more powerful relationship that dominates the other<br/>possibilities. In these terms none of the 12edo intervals represents a<br/>simple 7-limit consonance. 12edo contains consistent and _distinct_<br/>approximations for all the 5-limit intervals, but not 7-limit (for<br/>example 7/6 and 6/5 are confounded).</p><p>Note that Partch was opposed to all forms of temperament, and he<br/>definitely would not have equated 12edo with 5-limit JI.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2006 11:45:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Flavell&quot; &lt;bill_flavell@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s Claim That 12EDO Is &quot;5-Limit&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was reading Partch&apos;s Genesis yesterday, and his claim<br/>&gt; that 12EDO is &quot;5-limit&quot; is nonsense.</p><p>It&apos;s not nonsense, it&apos;s a judgment call.

The 400 cent<br/>interval, aka the cube root of 2, is very close indeed to 63/50. Three<br/>63/50s in a row is sharper than an octave by the landscape comma,<br/>250047/250000.
