Tuning<br/>fourths/fifths by harmonics is not going to work well at all for the<br/>19-tET guitar. But tuning a string to an identical (or octave)<br/>fretted note on an adjacent string, will work perfectly well,<br/>assuming your intonation is set up correctly (this is done the same<br/>way as on a 12-tET guitar, except the octave harmonic and octave<br/>fretted note you&apos;ll be comparing, though at the same position as<br/>before will now be at 19th, not 12th, fret).</p><p>&gt; I guess I&apos;d be interested<br/>&gt; in hearing about tuning a guitar in any n-tet,<br/>&gt; n!=12... Just looking at the rationales people have<br/>&gt; for what they choose, etc.</p><p>I play a 22-tone and a 31-tone equal tempered guitar, and Neil plays<br/>a 19-tone and 34-tone (and sold me his 31-tone in order to get<br/>another one). We have different rationales. Mine focus on simple<br/>scales (with, say, 7 or 10 notes) which allow a great variety<br/>of &quot;higher-limit&quot; harmony (basically, harmonies that go higher up the<br/>harmonic series than just triads) while also being appealing<br/>melodically like the diatonic scale. I&apos;d be happy to go deeper into<br/>this if you wish.</p><p>&gt; 2 - There was a thread on neutral thirds here awhile<br/>&gt; back, and I wasn&apos;t sure exactly what you were<br/>&gt; referring to on that point. Are these approximations<br/>&gt; of the so called &quot;blue-note&quot; (which correct me if I am<br/>&gt; wrong, is halfway between the minor and major<br/>&gt; thirds?)...</p><p>A neutral third is anything about halfway between a major third and a<br/>minor third. I find that to play the blues, the &quot;blue third&quot; (which<br/>is usually somewhere between a major third and a minor third)<br/>shouldn&apos;t be played as a single, fixed pitch, but involves a lot of<br/>bending, vibrato, and even microtonal phrasing within that tiny pitch<br/>zone.</p><p>&gt; 3 - And speaking of which, just what ratio is the<br/>&gt; minor third supposed to be approximating - 6/5 or 7/6?</p><p>It depends what you mean by &quot;supposed to&quot;. When the minor third first<br/>became thought of as a consonance, say about 1480, it tended to be<br/>tuned very close to 6/5. After 1800, when 12-tET and similar well-<br/>temperaments became the standard in the West, most theorists thought<br/>of it in terms of 6/5, but a few did mention 7/6 too. Physically, the<br/>12-tET minor third is more than twice as close to 6/5 than to 7/6,<br/>and since 6/5 is also slightly simpler, 6/5 tends to &quot;win out&quot; in<br/>terms of the psychoacoustical effects where ratios are relevant. But<br/>in some situations, especially for loud intervals in a high register,<br/>certain effects will make recognition of more complex ratios<br/>possible. It is there where the closeness of the 12-tET minor third<br/>to 19/16</p><p>&gt; It seems to fall in between the two in 12-Tet, and is<br/>&gt; off by a large amount in both (but 19-tet seems to hit<br/>&gt; 6/5 pretty squarely on the head).</p><p>That&apos;s right! 19-tET and 22-tET give you approximations to both kinds<br/>of minor third, with 31-tET giving both and a neutral third as well.</p><p>Let me know if any of this was unclear and please ask any further<br/>questions you&apos;d like to.</p><p>Later, Brian!</p></div><h3><a id=30308 href="#30308">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2001 8:35:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &lt;xbrianskix@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; And I was wondering if anyone has any<br/>&gt; &gt; tips/ideas on tuning such a guitar - can you just tune<br/>&gt; &gt; it the same way as a 12-tet guitar, or is the 4th/5th<br/>&gt; &gt; off by too much in 19-tet?</p><p>I should clarify something here -- standard Western (diatonic-based)<br/>notation &quot;works&quot; for 19-tET, and therefore you can tune your open<br/>strings to the 19-tET version of E, A, D, G, B, and E, and you&apos;ll be<br/>able to play anything that&apos;s notated in the standard way, pretty much<br/>the way you are used to playing it. The difference is that C# will<br/>now be different from Db, G# different from Ab, etc.</p><p>Standard Western notation doesn&apos;t work for certain tunings like 22-<br/>tET -- you&apos;ll find many different attempts that all have their own<br/>problems. For 19-tET (and some other ETs), however, there is<br/>essentially unanimous consensus on how to notate it:</p><p>19-tET<br/>------</p><p>0. C<br/>1. C#<br/>2. Db<br/>3. D<br/>4. D#<br/>5. Eb<br/>6.

You are speaking of the Bohlen-Pierce scale which uses a 3:1<br/>equivalency rather than the 2:1 octave.

He&apos;s less<br/>theoretical than I am and just figures out a way to make music<br/>directly on whatever instrument he&apos;s given (that&apos;s my impression<br/>anyway). Sometimes he uses the near-just triads that these tunings<br/>offer, but often he uses entirely new harmonies altogether.</p><p>&gt; For seconds, in your approach, are you just<br/>&gt; talking about 7th/9th/11th type chords</p><p>Of the harmonic series variety.</p><p>&gt; or something<br/>&gt; different?</p><p>I&apos;m also interested in &quot;Utonal&quot; or &quot;subharmonic&quot; chords, as well<br/>as &quot;asses&quot; (see <a href="http://x31eq.com/ass.htm">http://x31eq.com/ass.htm</a>). If a scale can<br/>produce plenty of these, it can also produce plenty of other nice<br/>chords with one or more dissonant interval(s).</p><p>Joseph answered you other question well . . . I&apos;ll wait and see if<br/>Bill Sethares wants to address the timbre/partials question as his<br/>name was mentioned -- for now I&apos;ll just say about the Bohlen-Pierce<br/>scale that Pierce felt the scale should be used with timbres<br/>consisting of only odd partials, while Bohlen does not . . . till<br/>then, any more questions?</p></div>
