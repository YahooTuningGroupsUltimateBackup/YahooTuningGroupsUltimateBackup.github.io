Thus I<br/>guessed that it might be best to give you some time to respond to my<br/>earlier message -- happily noting your mention of the theme of &quot;found<br/>objects&quot; -- before offering more new comments.</p><p>However, events can take on their own momentum, and I would like first<br/>to respond to few points of discussion, and then to express more about<br/>how reading your article has enriched my own approach to music.</p><p>First of all, the &quot;relevant properties&quot; of a given tuning can very<br/>much depend on style and context. This is an art, not an exact<br/>science. The best approach, it seems to me, is to compare notes in a<br/>framework of mutual appreciation and discovery, celebrating the ways<br/>in which the same intervals or &quot;grid&quot; patterns can inspire very<br/>different styles and interpretations.</p><p>For example, to learn the &quot;relevant properties&quot; of a 433-cent third in<br/>your music, I must enter your world, and seek to understand its<br/>sonorous beauty, with your theoretical concepts as a helpful map.</p><p>As it happens, a third around 433 cents is also one of my favorite<br/>intervals, but the context and thus the &quot;relevant properties&quot; are a<br/>bit different. Each style and perspective has its own value, its own<br/>world of possibilities.</p><p>At its best, comparing notes can not only give us a better<br/>understanding of each other&apos;s music and conceptual maps, but can lead<br/>to a bit of creative borrowing where a &quot;loan element&quot; from one style<br/>or tradition enriches another, rather like a linguistic loan word.<br/>Sometimes, this may mean &quot;discovering&quot; intervals that were already<br/>there in one&apos;s own intonational backyard, but had been neglected until<br/>a helpful visitor called our attention to them.</p><p>For example, I have a tuning based on two 12-note Pythagorean chains<br/>with some very small minor sixths at around 750.145 cents -- or, more<br/>precisely, a ratio of 57344:37179. Reading the remarks about 750-cent<br/>intervals in your paper, I have resolved to be sure that this<br/>beautiful interval gets used, as well as some related 42-cent and<br/>48-cent melodic microintervals.</p><p>Also, just yesterday, I was looking into some scales within a tuning<br/>system that has me really excited, and found myself looking at a<br/>progression where the scale seemed to shape the resolution as much as<br/>vice versa.</p><p>Then I said to myself, &quot;Ah, a &grave;found object&apos; reminding me a bit of<br/>Julia: taking the scale as a given, and going from there. It&apos;s OK to<br/>be curious about the possible theoretical implications, but at this<br/>point don&apos;t be too concerned -- just enjoy it, and see where it leads<br/>musically.&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s lots I could say about consonance/dissonance and related<br/>theories, but at the moment a bit of harmonic and melodic empathy<br/>could be more important than such an analysis, which I&apos;d be glad to<br/>discuss further at some point. For now, I&apos;ll just say that the<br/>questions you raise about the 4:3 fourth, and the minor sixth or<br/>related intervals at just about any ratio, are valid and important,<br/>and that the &quot;question of the fourth&quot; has a fascinating history in<br/>14th-17th century European theory which I find of great interest.</p><p>One thing I would like to acknowledge as someone who does often &quot;tune<br/>by ratios&quot; both large and small, or to tempered approximations of<br/>these ratios.</p><p>Somehow tuning &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;near-pure&quot; ratios can sometimes lead to a<br/>certain &quot;horse pride,&quot; to borrow a sobering metaphor. It was said in<br/>Classic times by one writer than the power and speed of riding a horse<br/>could result in an intoxicating sense of personal power and pride --<br/>possibly reflected in some of the wars and conquests of the era.</p><p>More generally, this might be temptation of any artist struggling and<br/>rejoicing to develop a new style, and facing allegations that this<br/>style is &quot;unnatural&quot; if not &quot;musically impossible.&quot; An unfortunate, if<br/>not so surprising, reaction is to reply that the &quot;common practice&quot; is<br/>in fact better described by such pejoratives.</p><p>Reflecting on the exchanges here, I suspect that one might catch a bit<br/>of this &quot;horse pride&quot; even in a musician and theorist such as Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger, who in her study _The Greek Aulos_ (1939) champions<br/>complex ratios with fascinating precedents in ancient Greek theory.<br/>She defines &quot;modal&quot; octaves based on sets of ratios like the following<br/>12-note piano tuning, for which I&apos;ll also give cents and 72-tET<br/>approximations:</p><p>22/22 22/21 22/20 22/19 22/18 22/17 22/16 22/15 22/14 22/13 22/12 22/11<br/>  0    81    165   254   347   446   551   663   782   911  1049  1200<br/>  0    83    167   250   350   450   550   667   783   913  1050  1200</p><p>Having presented this tuning, she remarks:</p><p>            &quot;Many musicians demur when introduced to the ratios<br/>             of this modally tuned piano, for they consider that<br/>             a scale containing intervals such as 12/11, 11/10,<br/>             15/13, forms a proposition impossible to bring into<br/>             operation in practical music. That is an objection<br/>             which comes naturally enough from modern musicians<br/>             born and brought up in an atmosphere of our major<br/>             and minor scales, with their more or less false<br/>             relations, but this is an entirely individual<br/>             matter, for many there are who react immediately<br/>             in delight on hearing this new language of music.&quot;<br/>             [Kathleen Schlesinger, _The Greek Aulos_ (Bouma&apos;s<br/>             Boekhuis, Groningen, 1970; Reprint of edition by<br/>             Methuen, London, 1939), p. 541.</p><p>Here one might ask, why &quot;more or less false relations&quot; instead of<br/>simply &quot;different relations&quot;? Please let me admit that I am hardly<br/>immune to this &quot;horse pride&quot; either. The antidote is to celebrate and<br/>assert the integrity both of our own traditions or styles and those of<br/>others, a balance sometimes more easily sought that maintained.</p><p>In fairness to Schlesinger, I should add that only a couple of pages<br/>later she quotes the composer Elsie Hamilton, an exponent of this<br/>integer-based music who explains that</p><p>             &quot;the two systems... represent two distinct<br/>              musical worlds, each quite complete in itself&quot;</p><p>and urges an approach of &quot;allowing each to work upon one through its<br/>own inner logicality.&quot; (Ibid. p. 543.)</p><p>If we can join in affirming and celebrating this kind of pluralism and<br/>tolerance, then the theoretical dialogues can follow in mutual respect<br/>as one side of a joyous comparing of notes.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
