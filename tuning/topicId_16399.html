The results are very<br/>kyool IMHO!!</p><p>As a young child in the early &apos;50&apos;s, before Elvis, I heard lots of big<br/>band swing numbers on the radio, and the sound got into my blood long<br/>before I knew much about classical music.  Like so many things, once it<br/>gets in, it never leaves...</p><p>I&apos;ve uploaded a lovely version of &quot;A String of Pearls&quot;, illustrating<br/>gliss plus tuning, to</p><p>   <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/</a><br/>   change into the JMids directory, and download <a href="http://pearls.zip">pearls.zip</a>.</p><p>(includes original 12-tET, 5-limit adaptive JI, 7-limit adaptive JI)</p><p>To me, the rich horn chords (starting about 1 minute into the 3-minute<br/>piece) come off so much better in 7-limit than in anything else!  I&apos;m<br/>using fairly rigid vertical springs, as has been my habit so far in<br/>multi-voice retunings.  Horns and winds seem not to &quot;mind&quot; horizontal<br/>motion as much as the piano does.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
