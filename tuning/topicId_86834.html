If I want to temper out 2200/2197, I can break it into three powers of some other factors (instead of four powers of prime numbers), which will offer me a possible solution. So if I call the three factors &quot;x, y, z&quot; and I assign, for example, &quot;x = 2/13, y = 5, z = 11&quot;, then 2200/2197 equals to &quot;x^3 * y^2 * z^1&quot; or &quot;x*y*x*y*x*z&quot;. These multiplications exploit some sort of periodicity and therefore one possible generator of 10/13 (i.e. x*y) can be chained essentially &quot;ad infinitum&quot; while 2/13 (i.e. the remaining x) is the other generator which complements the temperament and allows you to get only &quot;slightly higher&quot; than 1/11. If our aim is to approximate 8:10:11:13 rather than 1/(8:10:11:13), we can invert it all and replace some octave equivalents, so we get generators of 13/10 (a) and 13/8 (b), which makes a*a*b slightly lower than 11/4. Of course, you may decide to approximate other chords as well, but if you wish to have as many locations of the primary target approximants as possible, then using one generator once and another generator more times is the best way of &quot;harnessing&quot; a 3D temperament which I can think of.</p><p>&gt; I found that an other co&iuml;ncidence occurs between 5A+3B (=4798.236 c.)<br/>&gt;  and 4 octaves (4096000/4084223) - have you noticed that ?</p><p>Actually, I haven&apos;t. ;-)</p><p>&gt; Could it be eventually tempered as well ?</p><p>It could but you would get a pretty complex temperament. And if I try to make it less complex, then one generator has to be something pretty weird -- for example, if &quot;a&quot; is 320/169 and &quot;b&quot; is 13/8, then a*b*b makes 5/1 and a*a*a*b is slightly higher than 11/1.</p><p>&gt; Also, have you special reasons to choose 455.073 and 840.957 cents ?</p><p>Yes, both 11/4 and 11/5 have the least possible mistuning, which is better than having one interval mistuned twice as much and the other pure.</p><p>&gt; Although it would be a subtle difference to hear, I found that 455.0422 and 840.0102 c.<br/>&gt; would realize the differential coherence of all 11/10 and 13/8 intervals,<br/>&gt; in addition of equal-beating of 11/10 and 13/10 intervals.</p><p>Not sure what you mean by differential coherence.</p><p>BTW: Your mention of 37-equal reminds me of a 2D temperament which I found back in 2006 but haven&apos;t been able to realize so far (see message #75311) and another from March 2008 whose period is 2/1 and whose generator is the 13th root of 130.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86911 href="#86911">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2010 4:32:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr wrote :</p><p>(Jacques) :<br/>&gt;&gt; Although it would be a subtle difference to hear, I found that<br/>455.0422 and 840.0102 c.<br/>&gt;&gt; would realize the differential coherence of all 11/10 and 13/8<br/>intervals,<br/>&gt;&gt; in addition of equal-beating of 11/10 and 13/10 intervals.</p><p>&gt; Not sure what you mean by differential coherence.</p><p>The first-order difference tones of all &quot;11/10&quot; and &quot;13/8&quot; intervals<br/>of your temperament,<br/>11 - 10 = 1<br/>13 - 8 = 5<br/>are in tuned with the scale (in the case of octaves = 2/1).<br/>It will become audible with proper sounds of course, like in my<br/>photosonic disks but also with many acoustic or electric instruments.<br/>I use it myself in extended JI mainly, but it does not requires the<br/>tuning to be in any JI.</p><p>&gt; BTW: Your mention of 37-equal reminds me of a 2D temperament which<br/>&gt; I found back in 2006 but haven&apos;t been able to realize so far (see<br/>&gt; message #75311) and another from March 2008 whose period is 2/1 and<br/>&gt; whose generator is the 13th root of 130.</p><p>Of 87-edo you mean ?

I&apos;ll have to really explore 87-equal<br/>&gt; one day.</p><p>I did not know Carl did. I found that 87-equal for your 2200/2197<br/>temperamentis better than any other smaller number (I don&apos;t know for<br/>130^(1/13)).<br/>37-equal here is correct but does not make the difference between 2A<br/>- B  and B - 7A (5 and 4 steps in 87 tones) - or tempers them, as you<br/>like.<br/>With very small numbers 10, 13, 16 also give some honest<br/>approximations - 13 and 16, at least, are logical DE subsets for your<br/>temperament, in the sense they don&apos;t break the A-chains.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And the 47 steps can be found very easily in your temperament, by<br/>doing (-B -2A).</p><p>&gt; Hmmm, I&apos;ll probably tak&eacute; all of these strange non-3 commas, sooner<br/>&gt; or later, and see what happens if I temper out at least two of them<br/>&gt; at the same time.</p><p>Good idea, it seems they could be musically complementary.</p><p>&gt; 0 7 12 16 21 28 33 40 45 49 54 61 66 73 78 82 (87)</p><p>&gt; Not sure about this but don&apos;t DE scales have only two one-step<br/>&gt; interval sizes ?</p><p>MOS scales have been said to have 2 interval sizes.

But I found the same, and I found a few other meantones presenting such &quot;triple-equal beating&quot; properties, possibly already known, I don&apos;t know. I was going to post that on the Tuning List last year, but at that time I had only five, and I had the feeling that one was missing... Recently I have found the sixth guy, and perhaps an ancient one could be a seventh, anyway they are a good number and I will take the time to present them some day : soon in your TL mails...<br/>There is no contradiction between having different sizes of fifths and following equal (or synchronous)-beating algorithms. On the contrary, once you know the right recurrent algorithms (whose solutions are irrational), you have total freedom to use all the rational frequencies you want, as long as they follow these algorithms, and each has an infinity of versions. Of course you don&apos;t need to follow any sequence at all, and I do it also.<br/>I will have to take a look at your tunings, because I don&apos;t understand why a pitch transposition would affect the beat rates proportions, unless you want to keep the same beat rates, or I don&apos;t catch the problem.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve just tried to temper out both 20480/20449 and 2200/2197 at the &gt; same time.
