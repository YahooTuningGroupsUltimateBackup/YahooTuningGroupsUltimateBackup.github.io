One of<br/>the features of the main theme is a &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; passing tone used to better<br/>harmonize in context of the left hand defining fifth. This (simple) piece<br/>is performed on my 17 edo keyboard layout after a bit of practice. Piano<br/>and flute recorded in separate takes.</p><p><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/for-flute-and-piano-in-17-notes-per-octave/">http://chrisvaisvil.com/for-flute-and-piano-in-17-notes-per-octave/</a></p></div>
