These days,<br/>I&apos;m particularily involved with and interested in various &quot;folk intonations&quot;<br/>that, when looked at closely, just happen to be just.</p><p>I play various stringed instruments including acoustic guitars, mandolins,<br/>bouzouki, banjo, fiddle, tsimbl (eastern European hammered dulcimer), uke,<br/>percussion... Microtonal excursions tend to happen mostly on acoustic lap<br/>steel and slide resonator guitars, fretless banjo, fiddle, cumbus, 31ET<br/>fretted dulcimer/zither like creature, overtone flutes, didjeridus and<br/>various percussive items. At various points in the past, I&apos;ve also explored<br/>microtonality via both 19 and 31 ET guitars and a Yamaha TX-81Z, I no longer<br/>have these instruments.</p><p>I&apos;m currently trying to find an acoustic guitar to outfit with the Novatone<br/>Interchangeable Fretboard system (after many years of looking for one, I<br/>found a kit languishing in the basement of a music store where I teach, and<br/>bought it). Does anybody have any experiences wih using this system, or has<br/>it already been dealt with somewhere in the archives? I&apos;d like to hear of<br/>anyone elses&apos; experiences with this, good, bad or other. One of these days I<br/>would also like to find (or have built) a fretless guitar.</p><p>I look forward to meeting others on the list. That&apos;s all for now.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen<br/>please visit me on the web at <a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>Download a song (mp3) at <a href="http://www.mp3.com/sethausten">www.mp3.com/sethausten</a></p></div><h3><a id=15452 href="#15452">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2000 8:09:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Just wanted to say I have the utmost respect for all the folks who<br/>&gt;play, theorize, or create microtonal music...it&apos;s a fun ride, and I feel<br/>&gt;we are changing the way music is percieved...and that&apos;s no small<br/>&gt;thing...keep it up...Hstick</p><p>Hey, Neil, thanks for the post!  A bunch of us were just discussing at<br/>Microthon (in NYC) yesterday what a special decade it&apos;s been for tuning.<br/>We&apos;re all part of something really cool, here...</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
