I think this was Schenker&apos;s point---that all melodies are<br/>ultimately arpeggiations of harmonies,  elaborated of course with passing<br/>motions, neighbour-motions, etc. etc. etc.   (and in Schenker&apos;s defense, I<br/>think he believed his analyses would help to show the coolness of the<br/>*elaboration*  (rather than to simply reduce every tune to a triad or<br/>descending scale)).</p><p>But apart from Schenker, take Indian raga---It&apos;s always against a drone,<br/>which is an important, and inescapably &quot;dyadic&quot; fact.</p><p>for example, I have heard some ragas that are roughly like this:<br/>drone on C, for example.  The tones used in the melody are only<br/>B Db E F# Ab  (or some similarly chromatically related pentatonic<br/>collection). Now this is a powerful sound, the player/singer never even<br/>touches the tonic,  and has those two powerful upper and lower leading<br/>tones, etc.  BUT, it&apos;s absolutely dependent on the drone, on the fact of<br/>being against it, that gives this scale it&apos;s strange affect.  Without it,<br/>there&apos;d just be a happy pentatonic scale. (Perhaps an oddly tuned one, but<br/>nonetheless. . .)</p><p>Thus the power of the melody depends on the harmony (among other factors<br/>of course.)</p><p>Carrying this idea a bit further, to apply to any music, even without<br/>drones explicitly,   hearing any melodic motion as an<br/>interval depends on hearing the first note of the motion, in a certain<br/>way, as a &quot;drone&quot; against the second note.  A &quot;wide expressive leap&quot; is<br/>such because you remember the first note of the leap, and the second note,<br/>against it, is &quot;far away.&quot;  Again, this is a harmonic concept.</p><p>I am always thankful that music is not in fact so cut and dried in<br/>such divisions of &quot;melody&quot; vs. &quot;harmony&quot;,  etc. etc.,  but instead is<br/>filled with wierd objects, events, hybrids of all those elements and<br/>parameters we love to separate it into.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=18579 href="#18579">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2001 11:36:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>......................<br/>&gt; for example, I have heard some ragas that are roughly like this:<br/>&gt; drone on C, for example.

It sounds like<br/>this: [ &apos;Dha = Dha in lower octave; &apos;Ni = Ni in lower octave; komala<br/>stands for flat, and teevra for sharp]<br/>(C);  A    B   Db       E   F#        A   etc.<br/>Sa ; &apos;Dha &apos;Ni Re(komal) Ga Ma(teevra) Dha etc.<br/>This is the only popular raga (out of about 125) in which the direct<br/>singing of the tonic [C here, Sa] is as much avoided/delayed as<br/>possible.<br/>Noteworthy: It is very difficult to find vadi and samvadi for Marwa.<br/>C cannot be vadi, because the raga omits F (shuddha Ma) and Pa (G).<br/>It has a teevra Ma (F#), which is a tritone and can never have<br/>consonance with Sa (C).  Secondly, Dha (A) can be a vadi  only with<br/>shuddha Re (D) or shuddha Ga (E).  In Marwa, we have only komala Re<br/>(Db), and Ga(E) cannot be allowed to be a vadi, because then it will<br/>need to be emphasised, making Marwa sound like another Raga called<br/>Puriya.  Thirdly, Ni (B) can be a vadi only Ga (E), but, as said<br/>earlier, then Marwa would sound like Puriya.  Fourthly, F# cannot be<br/>a vadi (or samvadi).  So, we cannot decide the vadi-samvadi pair for<br/>Marwa.  The consonant pair selected, sometimes, is Dha (A)-REkomala<br/>(Db).<br/>In theory, if you make Dha (A) the tonic, Marwa will &quot;sound&quot; like<br/>Bhupali, with A B Db E F#  now sounding like Sa Re Ga Pa Dha.  if you<br/>stretch the parrallelism further, the vadi-samvadi- pair for Bhupali<br/>is Ga-Dha, that is, Re komala (Db)-Ma teevra (F#) of Marwa.  This,<br/>again, is unacceptable.<br/>Incidently, the famous singer, late Ustad Amir Khan, is credited with<br/>singing Marwa without singing Sa (C) even once, the sound of Sa<br/>coming only from the tanpura (drone).</p><p>Does Indian music have absolutely NO harmony?

I have<br/>saved them all and reread them many times, to try and better understand<br/>these concepts. I have been greatly inspired and influenced by Indian<br/>classical music for many years, and have at times used various techniques<br/>that I&apos;ve learned from it in my own composition and improvisation, although<br/>I make absolutely no pretense of being any sort of expert in the formal<br/>practice of raga.</p><p>I am particularily interested in this discussion regarding the melodic uses<br/>of scales that avoid and/or delay the tonic, even while the tonic is<br/>constant in the drone. A number of years ago I composed a partially<br/>improvisational guitar piece using the following scale, in 12-ET: B C D F G<br/>A# B over a constant B drone. For the middle section, I used a common major<br/>type pentatonic scale found inside the parent scale, starting on the seventh<br/>degree: Bb (A#) C D F G Bb. The B drone remained constant throughout,<br/>however I avoided the melodic use of the B tonic. The tension created by<br/>this normally cheery/bright major scale superimposed over this drone was/is<br/>incredibly beautiful and powerful to my ears.</p><p>This seems quite similar to your example, with the exception of the drone<br/>note in relation to the rest of the scale. Here&apos;s my scale transposed to the<br/>same notes as your demonstration of Marwa: (Bb) A B C# E F# A. The only<br/>difference is the pentatonic being superimposed over Bb drone instead of C.</p><p>I hope that my use of this scale in this way is not offensive to you or<br/>anyone else schooled in raga. I understand that the rules in Indian<br/>classical music are quite exacting, and I mean no disrespect by my possible<br/>mis-uses of this material.</p><p>&gt; Incidently, the famous singer, late Ustad Amir Khan, is credited with<br/>&gt; singing Marwa without singing Sa (C) even once, the sound of Sa<br/>&gt; coming only from the tanpura (drone).</p><p>Was this recorded and might it be available on CD?
