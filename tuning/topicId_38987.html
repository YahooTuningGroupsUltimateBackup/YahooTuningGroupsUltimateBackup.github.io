Two things<br/>I&apos;d like to ask:</p><p>1. How easy is it to remove the frets from a guitar (let&apos;s assume I&apos;ve<br/>bought a used instrument that I can experiment on)?</p><p>2. Has anyone tried tying on frets with gut string like viols?</p><p>Talking of viols - I&apos;ve been in conversation with several luthiers over the<br/>past weeks about viols/refretting and tuning - it seems that luthiers and<br/>books go on about 7 frets for the 7th, which makes for some kind of cyclic<br/>12 tone tuning, yet players prefer to use 1/4 MT or similar (with<br/>adjustments for ear) and position the frets accordingly, given that viol<br/>music doesn&apos;t tend to be overly chromatic. This begs another question:</p><p>if viol tuning is</p><p>4th 4th M3rd 4th 4th,</p><p>if we assume just then we can&apos;t get the two outer strings at 2 2/1s, so the<br/>middle third must be pythagorean in size or thereabouts.</p><p>Is this right? Does anyone have any thoughts or knowledge on this?</p><p>Mark GOuld</p></div>
