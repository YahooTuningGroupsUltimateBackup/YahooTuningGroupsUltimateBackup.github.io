Has anyone measured the effects scientifically</p><p>and documented the findings? How would one measure something like this?<br/>----------------<br/>Brian :<br/>From  many years I suspect this is connected with the low frequency<br/>brain waves.<br/>When a person makes Trascedental Meditation increase his bain waves<br/>voltage.<br/>I think to remember that the Alfa waves augment from 80 microvolts to<br/>almost one milivolt. This may occur in old Yoga persons.<br/>Do you know that the lower threshold of the Brain waves are by Octaves ?<br/>(or almost).<br/>Yes, this is very interesting.<br/>There are several numbers linking the music with the brain waves.<br/>Many years ago I made a study and I&apos;ve found aprox. 15 relations.<br/>Latter came the endorphines.<br/>If it may prove the variation of the voltages or endorphines as a effect<br/>of JI music, it would be sensational !</p><p>Eduardo</p></div>
