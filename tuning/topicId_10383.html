Similarly, a complete 5-limit triad (fifth, major third, minor<br/>third) may have the major third below and the minor third below, or<br/>the converse.</p><p>From the medieval Latin _e converso_ of Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous I<br/>(c. 1290 or 1300) and Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325), I derive the English<br/>term &quot;conversity&quot; to describe these mirror sonorities.</p><p>Section 1 of this article places these trinic and triadic conversities<br/>on a concrete basis: the ratios between the frequencies of their<br/>tones, or between the lengths of strings or organ pipes producing<br/>these tones. We encounter two basic divisions, the &quot;mean-frequency&quot;<br/>and &quot;mean-string&quot; divisions, which when applied to the outer intervals<br/>of the octave and fifth produce the two mirrorlike flavors of 3-limit<br/>trines and 5-limit triads respectively. The symmetry of these<br/>divisions can be expressed graphically by a &quot;mirrored&quot; ratio notation.</p><p>Section 2, taking an &quot;historically correct&quot; medieval and Renaissance<br/>approach, derives both flavors of trines and triads from string-ratios<br/>alone, introducing the &quot;harmonic/arithmetic&quot; contrast.</p><p>Section 3 draws some connections between these approaches, suggesting<br/>some possible notational conventions.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Trines and triads: mean-frequency and mean-string divisions<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>When we speak of a pure fourth as having a ratio of 4:3, two concrete<br/>interpretations are possible. We might be comparing either the<br/>frequency-ratio or vibrational rates of the upper and lower notes of<br/>the fourth, e.g. 400 Hertz (cycles per second) and 300 Hertz; or the<br/>string-ratio between the lengths of strings or organ pipes producing<br/>the lower and upper notes, e.g. 40 centimeters and 30 centimeters.</p><p>We may note that in a frequency-ratio reading, the first number of 4:3<br/>refers to the _higher_ note (having the greater frequency); in a<br/>string-ratio reading, it refers to the _lower_ note (produced by the<br/>string with the greater length). Some readers might compare this<br/>reciprocal relationship to that between frequency and wavelength in<br/>physics.</p><p>In either interpretation, however, the ratio 4:3 describes the same<br/>musical interval, a pure fourth. As the noted writer Gertrude Stein<br/>might say, &quot;A 4:3 is a 4:3 is a 4:3.&quot;</p><p>Moving beyond simple two-voice intervals to combinations having three<br/>or more notes and intervals, however, we find that these two<br/>interpretations can produce kindred but contrasting sonorities with a<br/>musical as well as mathematical difference.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.1. Medievalists bearing synthesizers: 3-limit trines<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Let us suppose that we have a set of tone-generators, each of which<br/>may be set digitally to any desired frequency. We tune two of these<br/>generators to 200 Hertz and 400 Hertz, forming a pure 2:1 octave.</p><p>Let us now add a third note whose frequency is equal to the _average_<br/>or mean of these two frequencies -- that is, to 300 Hertz. We then get<br/>the following sonority:</p><p>        | 400<br/>        |      4:3 (4)<br/>2:1 (8) | 300<br/>        |      3:2 (5)<br/>        | 200</p><p>In addition to the two outer notes at an octave of 400:200 or 2:1, we<br/>now have an interval between the lower two voices of 300:200 or 3:2, a<br/>pure fifth. Between the two upper voices we have a ratio of 400:300 or<br/>4:3, a pure fourth.</p><p>This three-note division of the octave into a fifth below and a fourth<br/>above -- Jacobus of Liege speaks of the third middle voice as<br/>&quot;partitioning&quot; or &quot;splitting&quot; the outer octave -- represents the ideal<br/>stable sonority of 13th-14th century European music. Johannes de<br/>Grocheio (c. 1300) describes it as manifesting the _trina harmoniae<br/>perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony&quot; -- thus the modern<br/>English &quot;trine&quot; -- while Jacobus remarks that it is the best way of<br/>ending a polyphonic composition.</p><p>Although frequency-ratios were not then in use, we may in modern terms<br/>describe this division of the octave as a &quot;mean-frequency&quot; division:<br/>that is, the added third note has a frequency equal to the _mean_ or<br/>average of the two outer notes of the 2:1 octave.</p><p>While our specific realization of this mean-frequency division of the<br/>octave happens to involve a frequency-ratio of 200:300:400, the more<br/>general pattern may be expressed by a ratio of 2:3:4, using the<br/>simplest possible integers.</p><p>Note that in writing frequency-ratios of three or more notes, an<br/>_ascending_ order of numbers such as 200:300:400 or 2:3:4 fits the<br/>common convention of describing a sonority from the lowest note<br/>(lowest frequency, slowest vibration rate) to the highest. Thus our<br/>2:3:4 sonority has a fifth (2:3) below and fourth (3:4) above.</p><p>Interestingly, a medieval theorist such as Jacobus also seems to<br/>prefer an ascending order for reckoning the intervals in a sonority:<br/>in this arrangement, he speaks of the lower fifth being placed<br/>&quot;before&quot; (_ante_) the upper fourth, or of the fourth being placed<br/>&quot;after&quot; (_post_) the fifth.</p><p>Now shifting to a more traditional technology, let us suppose that we<br/>have two strings with lengths of 400 centimeters and 200 centimeters<br/>which produce a pure octave. We now add a third string with a length<br/>equal to the average or mean of these two, 300 centimeters:</p><p>        | 200<br/>        |      3:2 (5)<br/>2:1 (8) | 300<br/>        |      4:3 (4)<br/>        | 400</p><p>As with our three digital frequency-generators, we find that our<br/>division of the octave has produced a complete trine: outer octave,<br/>fifth, and fourth. However, our new sonority has a different<br/>arrangement of these intervals.</p><p>Here the lower pair of strings, with a string-ratio of 400:300,<br/>produce a 4:3 fourth; while the upper two strings, with a ratio of<br/>300:200, produce a 3:2 fifth. The fourth is now below, and the fifth<br/>above -- a &quot;mirroring&quot; of our earlier division.</p><p>We may refer to our new division as a &quot;mean-string&quot; division: our<br/>third string has a length equal to the average or mean length of the<br/>two strings forming the outer octave.</p><p>Proceeding from the lowest note to the highest, we might express this<br/>mean-string division as a 400:300:200 division, or more generally a<br/>4:3:2 division. Since the _longest_ string produces the lowest note,<br/>it seems natural to write such string-ratios in a _descending_ order.<br/>Here we have a 4:3 fourth (400:300) _below_ and a 3:2 fifth (300:200)<br/>above.</p><p>Jacobus discusses this alternative arrangement, with the fourth placed<br/>&quot;before&quot; (_ante_) the fifth, at some length, concluding that while<br/>concordant, it is less pleasing than its counterpart with the fifth<br/>below and fourth above, where the more concordant fifth &quot;supports&quot; and<br/>&quot;fortifies&quot; the less concordant fourth.</p><p>In sum, our mean-frequency division of 2:3:4 and our mean-string<br/>division of 4:3:2 yield mirrorlike trines with converse arrangements<br/>of the fifth and fourth.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.2. Renaissance musical fashions: 5-limit _harmonia perfetta_<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Having derived the two flavors of Gothic trines from our<br/>&quot;mean-frequency&quot; and &quot;mean-string&quot; divisions of the 2:1 octave, let us<br/>now apply the same procedure to the pure 3:2 fifth.</p><p>Returning to our tone generators, we tune two of them to such a fifth,<br/>say at 200 Hertz and 300 Hertz, and add a third generator at the mean<br/>frequency of 250 Hertz:</p><p>        | 300<br/>        |      6:5 (m3)<br/>3:2 (5) | 250<br/>        |      5:4 (M3)<br/>        | 200</p><p>This is the ideal harmony of the 16th century, described by Gioseffo<br/>Zarlino in 1558 as _harmonia perfetta_ or &quot;perfect harmony,&quot; and in<br/>1612 dubbed by Johannes Lippius the _trias harmonica_ or &quot;harmonic<br/>triad.&quot; The two lower tones with a ratio of 200:250 or 5:4 form a pure<br/>major third, while the upper two with a ratio of 250:300 form a pure<br/>6:5 minor third.</p><p>We can describe this &quot;mean-frequency&quot; division of the fifth as a<br/>200:250:300 division, or more generally a 4:5:6 division.</p><p>Moving again from digital generators to strings, we start with two<br/>strings with lengths of 300 and 200 centimeters, forming another pure<br/>3:2 fifth. Adding a third string with a length equal to the average or<br/>mean of these, we arrive at another popular Renaissance sonority:</p><p>        | 200<br/>        |      5:4 (M3)<br/>3:2 (5) | 250<br/>        |      6:5 (m3)<br/>        | 300</p><p>In a mirrorlike reflection of our previous sonority, we have an outer<br/>fifth again divided into two thirds -- but this time with the lower<br/>two strings forming a 300:250 or 6:5 ratio, a pure minor third; and<br/>the upper strings forming a 250:200 or 5:4 ratio, a pure major third.</p><p>We can express this &quot;mean-string&quot; division of the fifth as<br/>300:250:200, or more generally 6:5:4.</p><p>Zarlino, Lippius, and other theorists of the 16th and early 17th<br/>centuries tell us that the arrangement with the major third below is<br/>more &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;joyful,&quot; while that with the minor third below is<br/>more &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;gentle.&quot; In the latter arrangement, Zarlino concludes,<br/>the consonances are &quot;out of their natural order.&quot; This effect on the<br/>ear in arranging &quot;a mass of consonances&quot; he elsewhere compares to that<br/>on the eye of placing the ceiling of a building where the foundation<br/>is expected.</p><p>Thus our two divisions of the fifth, the mean-frequency division of<br/>4:5:6 and the mean-string division of 6:5:4, produce a pair of<br/>mirrorlike sonorities or conversities analogous to our trinic 2:3:4<br/>and 4:3:2 divisions of the octave.</p><p>The parallel is musical as well as mathematical: just as Jacobus<br/>expresses a preference for a trine with the 3:2 fifth below and the<br/>4:3 fourth above, so Zarlino prefers a _harmonia perfetta_ with the<br/>5:4 major third below and the 6:5 minor third above.</p><p>Our mean-frequency divisions produce these favored arrangements -- but<br/>the application of frequency-ratios to music goes back in the Western<br/>European tradition only to around the early 17th century. After<br/>considering a convenient convention of modern notation, we take a more<br/>&quot;musicologically correct&quot; approach to deriving these favored<br/>sonorities using only string-ratios.</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>1.3. Multi-voice ratios: A mirrorlike notation<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>When discussing the ratios of simple intervals, convention generally<br/>places the larger number first: thus a 2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth, etc. In<br/>a medieval or Renaissance setting before the widespread introduction<br/>of frequency-ratios in the 17th century, this ordering fits a<br/>preference for beginning with the lower note (longer string or pipe).</p><p>Another 17th-century development, the application of logarithms to<br/>music (most familiar today in the cents measurement), may also<br/>motivate this ordering. Ratios smaller than unity, such as 1:2 or 2:3,<br/>would seem to imply negative logarithmic measures, for example &quot;an<br/>octave of 1:2, or -1200 cents.&quot;</p><p>When stating frequency-ratios or string-ratios for sonorities with<br/>three or more notes, however, I find it a useful convention always to<br/>list notes in ascending order: for example, a mean-frequency trine of<br/>2:3:4 but a mean-string trine of 4:3:2.</p><p>One great advantage of this convention is that we can tell immediately<br/>that 2:3:4 is a frequency-ratio while 4:3:2 is a string-ratio -- and<br/>likewise 4:5:6 and 6:5:4 for the mean-frequency and mean-string<br/>flavors of 5-limit triads.</p><p>Also, this convention makes graphically clear both the symmetrical<br/>nature of these related divisions, sharing identical intervals in<br/>converse arrangements, and the sequence of intervals in each<br/>arrangement:</p><p>    2:3:4      &quot;a 2:3 fifth followed by a 3:4 fourth&quot;<br/>    4:3:2      &quot;a 4:3 fourth followed by a 3:2 fifth&quot;</p><p>    4:5:6      &quot;a 4:5 major third followed by a 5:6 minor third&quot;<br/>    6:5:4      &quot;a 6:5 minor third followed by a 5:4 major third&quot;</p><p>These last examples suggest a possible exception to the rule of<br/>stating two-voice interval ratios with the higher number first. When<br/>reading the intervals in a multi-voice sonority defined by a<br/>frequency-ratio such as 2:3:4, it seems natural to follow the order of<br/>the notation: &quot;a 2:3 fifth followed by a 3:4 fourth,&quot; etc.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. With string-ratios attached: harmonic/arithmetic contrasts<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Although medieval theorists of the Pythagorean tradition such as<br/>Boethius (c. 480-524) describe higher notes as having more &quot;intense&quot;<br/>or rapid vibrations than lower notes, the concrete basis of medieval<br/>and Renaissance music theory focuses on string-ratios. Thus the use of<br/>frequency-ratios in Section 1, while convenient, was somewhat<br/>anachronistic -- beware medievalists bearing synthesizers!</p><p>Relying on string-ratios exclusively to generate our paired flavors of<br/>3-limit trines and 5-limit triads, we discover another approach to<br/>these sonorities: the &quot;harmonic/arithmetic&quot; contrast.</p><p>----------------------<br/>2.1. Gothic perfection<br/>----------------------</p><p>We have already used string-ratios to construct one variety of trine,<br/>the &quot;mean-string&quot; or 4:3:2 division of the octave with the 4:3 fourth<br/>below and the 3:2 fifth above:</p><p>        | 2<br/>        |    3:2 (5)<br/>2:1 (8) | 3<br/>        |    4:3 (4)<br/>        | 4</p><p>In medieval and Renaissance terms, this is an &quot;arithmetic&quot; division of<br/>the octave, in which the two pairs of adjacent terms have equal<br/>differences. That is, the difference in length between the lower pair<br/>of strings forming the 4:3 fourth (4 - 3 = 1) is equal to that between<br/>the upper pair of strings forming the 3:2 fifth (3 - 2 = 1).</p><p>A diagram may make this equality of differences between the pairs of<br/>adjacent terms more clear:</p><p>                 4       :       3       :       2<br/>                      (4 - 3)         (3 - 2)<br/>                         1       =       1</p><p>                 Arithmetic division of 2:1 octave</p><p>To obtain the ideally euphonious form of Gothic trine with the fifth<br/>below and fourth above, we need to find a different kind of division.<br/>Here it may help to choose a larger number of units for the lowest<br/>string, avoiding the complication of fractional string lengths and<br/>also following the medieval tradition that musical ratios should be<br/>expressed in whole integers or &quot;multitudes&quot; rather than possibly<br/>fractional &quot;magnitudes.&quot;</p><p>Taking the length of our lowest string as 12 -- evenly divisible by 2,<br/>3, and 4 -- we begin with a 12:6 octave and seek a division which will<br/>yield our trine with fifth below and fourth above.</p><p>Our middle string must form a 3:2 fifth with the lowest string, and<br/>thus be equal to 2/3 of its length of 12 units. We find that a string<br/>of 8 units forms the required 12:8 or 3:2 fifth, and also forms our<br/>desired 8:6 or 4:3 fourth with the upper string:</p><p>        | 6<br/>        |    4:3 (4)<br/>2:1 (8) | 8<br/>        |    3:2 (5)<br/>        | 12</p><p>Interestingly, Jacobus observes that the ratio of 12:8:6 suggests the<br/>structure of a cube, which has 12 edges, 8 corners, and 6 faces. More<br/>generally, this ratio -- more simply expressed as 6:4:3 -- exemplifies<br/>a kind of division which can be applied to various intervals: the<br/>_harmonic_ division.</p><p>In an arithmetic division such as 4:3:2, the two pairs of adjacent<br/>terms have equal differences. Our 12:8:6 division has a different<br/>property capturing the admiration of medieval and Renaissance<br/>musicians: the differences between these pairs of adjacent terms have<br/>a proportion equal to that between the outer terms.</p><p>A diagram may help in appreciating this somewhat subtle point:</p><p>                 12       :      8       :       6<br/>                      (12 - 8)        (8 - 6)<br/>                          4      :       2</p><p>                  Harmonic division of 2:1 octave</p><p>Here the two strings forming the lower 12:8 fifth have a difference in<br/>length of (12 - 8) or 4, while the two strings of the upper 8:6 fourth<br/>have a difference of (8 - 6) or 2. These differences yield a ratio of<br/>4:2 or 2:1 -- identical to that of the outer 12:6 or 2:1 octave.</p><p>For theorists such as Jacobus, following ancient Greek tradition,<br/>these mathematical and musical divisions can have political overtones,<br/>with the arithmetic division representing the indiscriminate equality<br/>of a democracy, and the harmonic division the justly distributed<br/>inequality of an ideal aristocracy. A philosopher of a different bent<br/>might compare the arithmetic division to a flat tax, and the harmonic<br/>division to an equitably distributed progressive income tax.</p><p>In any case, the harmonic and arithmetic divisions of the octave -- in<br/>simplest form 6:4:3 and 4:3:2, respectively -- yield our two flavors<br/>of trine. While both trines are used to superb musical effect in the<br/>grand style of a composer such as Perotin (c. 1200), the harmonic<br/>division with the fifth below and fourth above is the ideally<br/>euphonious form in 13th-century practice and theory.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2.2. Zarlino and the 5-limit: _harmonia perfetta_ in two flavors<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We have already met the &quot;mean-string&quot; division of the fifth yielding a<br/>complete 5-limit sonority with a 6:5 minor third below and a 5:4 major<br/>third above -- or, in 16th-century terms, the arithmetic division:</p><p>        | 4<br/>        |      5:4 (M3)<br/>3:2 (5) | 5<br/>        |      6:5 (m3)<br/>        | 6</p><p>We can confirm that this is an arithmetic division by noting that the<br/>lower pair of strings forming the 6:5 minor third have a difference of<br/>length (6 - 5 = 1) equal to that of the upper pair of strings forming<br/>the 5:4 major third (5 - 4 = 1). Or, in diagrammatic terms:</p><p>                 6       :       5       :       4<br/>                      (6 - 5)         (5 - 4)<br/>                         1       =       1</p><p>                  Arithmetic division of 3:2 fifth</p><p>As Zarlino informs us, this division can be very expressive but is<br/>less &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;joyful&quot; than that of the ideal harmonic division<br/>of the fifth with the major third below and minor third above. Let us<br/>now find the ratio for this ideal 16th-century arrangement.</p><p>In seeking the harmonic division of any unequal integer ratio, there<br/>is a helpful rule for choosing numbers large enough to avoid the need<br/>for fractional string lengths. To select a length for our lowest<br/>string, we add the two numbers of the ratio to be divided, and then<br/>multiply by the larger number of the ratio. More formally stated:</p><p>       In finding the harmonic division of an interval n:m<br/>       where n &gt; m, we may conveniently start with a lowest<br/>       string having a length of n (n + m).</p><p>Here we are dividing a pure fifth, with a ratio of 3:2. Thus we add<br/>the two terms 3 + 2, getting 5, and multiply by the larger term 3,<br/>getting 3 x 5 or 15 -- a convenient length for the lowest string of<br/>our division.</p><p>If the lowest string is 15, then the highest string forming with it an<br/>outer fifth must have a length equal to 2/3 of 15, or 10.</p><p>Our problem is now to add a third string forming a 5:4 major third<br/>with the lower string -- and thus having a length equal to 4/5 of 15.<br/>A string 12 units long neatly solves the problem, and also obligingly<br/>forms our desired 6:5 minor third with the upper string (12:10):</p><p>        | 10<br/>        |      6:5 (m3)<br/>3:2 (5) | 12<br/>        |      5:4 (M3)<br/>        | 15</p><p>This is indeed a harmonic division: the lower pair of strings forming<br/>the 5:4 major third have a difference of (15 - 12) or 3, while the<br/>upper pair of strings forming the 6:5 minor third have a difference of<br/>(12 - 10) or 2. These differences for a ratio of 3:2, identical to the<br/>15:10 or 3:2 ratio of the strings forming the outer fifth.</p><p>In diagrammatic terms:</p><p>                 15       :      12      :      10<br/>                      (15 - 12)      (12 - 10)<br/>                          3      :       2</p><p>                  Harmonic division of 3:2 fifth</p><p>Thus with Zarlino&apos;s divisions of the fifth to form 5-limit sonorities<br/>later dubbed &quot;triads&quot; by Lippius, as with the medieval divisions of<br/>the octave to form 3-limit trines, the harmonic and arithmetic ratios<br/>produce symmetrical &quot;mirrorlike&quot; sonorities here called conversities.<br/>In each case, while both divisions are musically important, the<br/>harmonic division produces the arrangement deemed more blending and<br/>conclusive in practice and theory.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>2.3. Finding divisions: formula for a 13-limit diversion<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Finding the arithmetic division of any unequal integer ratio -- note<br/>that a 1:1 unison is indivisible -- is a matter simply of finding the<br/>average of the ratio&apos;s two terms and adding a third term equal to this<br/>average. In some cases, we may find it convenient to multiply both<br/>terms by two in order to avoid fractions, but this is the only<br/>complication.</p><p>For example, suppose we wish to find the arithmetic division of a pure<br/>8:5 minor sixth. Since the sum of the terms, 13, is not evenly<br/>divisible by two, we simply multiply both terms by two, making the<br/>ratio 16:10, and find their average of 13 -- for an arithmetic<br/>division of 16:13:10.</p><p>If this division represents a string-ratio -- as the present context,<br/>and also the descending order 16:13:10, imply -- then we have a<br/>sonority with a 16:13 below (a largish neutral third, ~359.5 cents)<br/>and a 13:10 above (about midway between major third and fourth, ~454.2<br/>cents).</p><p>The harmonic division is a somewhat more complicated matter. In<br/>applying harmonic string-ratio divisions to a variety of intervals<br/>with integer ratios, one might use an assortment of algebraic or<br/>&quot;intuitive&quot; methods. Fortunately, it is also possible to use a rote<br/>formula like the following.</p><p>          For any musical interval with an integer ratio n:m,<br/>          where n &gt; m, we may define a three-note harmonic<br/>          division as follows:</p><p>          upper string  = m (n + m)<br/>          middle string = 2 mn<br/>          lower string  = n (n + m)</p><p>Thus to find the harmonic division of an 8:5 minor sixth, we calculate<br/>the lower string at 8 (8 + 5) or 13 x 8, giving 104. Our upper string<br/>is 5 (8 + 5), or 5 x 13, giving 65. Our middle string is 2 (8 x 5) or<br/>2 x 40, giving 80 -- a division of 104:80:65.</p><p>We have a lower interval of 104:80 or 13:10, our 454-cent<br/>&quot;between-major-third-and-fourth&quot;; and an upper interval of 80:65 or<br/>16:13, our 359-cent neutral third. This division of 8:5 involves<br/>intervals identical to those of our 16:13:10 arithmetic division --<br/>but conversely arranged, as with the more historically familiar<br/>3-limit and 5-limit divisions above.</p><p>Incidentally, returning briefly from our 13-limit excursion to the<br/>routine 5-limit practice of the Renaissance, we may duly observe that<br/>not all popular divisions need be either harmonic or arithmetic.</p><p>Composers and theorists of the 16th century get along happily with two<br/>5-limit divisions of an 8:5 minor sixth. The 24:20:15 division<br/>features a 6:5 minor third (24:20) below and a 4:3 fourth (20:15)<br/>above, e.g. E3-G3-C4. The alternative 8:6:5 division has a 4:3 fourth<br/>(8:6) below and a 6:5 minor third above, e.g. A3-D4-F4 -- the fourth<br/>above the bass calling in this era for a somewhat cautious treatment,<br/>but offering a mild sort of tension very attractively leading into a<br/>cadence. These two sonorities are conversities with the same intervals<br/>in mirrorlike arrangements, but neither is an arithmetic or harmonic<br/>division.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Strings and frequencies: connections and conventions<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For people oriented both to frequency-ratios and string-ratios, the<br/>notation of &quot;mean-frequency&quot; and &quot;mean-string&quot; ratios as advocated in<br/>Section 1.3 above -- the notes and intervals in either case listed in<br/>ascending order -- may provide a convenient way of describing the<br/>mirrorlike sonorities here termed conversities.</p><p>For example, one might say: &quot;This composer finds 4:5:6 a bit obvious,<br/>but often favors 6:5:4.&quot; Here it is understand that 4:5:6 is a<br/>frequency-ratio (4:5 major third below 6:5 minor third), while 6:5:4<br/>is the converse string-ratio division (6:5 below 5:4).</p><p>Likewise one might say, &quot;I find a 6:7:9 quite harmonious, but a 9:7:6<br/>rather unsettling unless the supermajor third expands to a fifth in<br/>the Gothic fashion.&quot; Here, although the sonorities are not<br/>mean-frequency or mean-string divisions, the notation nevertheless<br/>conveys the converse ordering of intervals.</p><p>Since even those of us today who are medievalists tend to be familiar<br/>with frequency-ratios as well as string-ratios, this style of notation<br/>has the advantage of visual symmetry as well as a simple and concrete<br/>basis: the frequencies of tones or the lengths of the strings or pipes<br/>producing them.</p><p>In discussions involving the harmonic/arithmetic concept, historical<br/>associations would suggest that these terms might conventionally imply<br/>string-ratios rather than frequency-ratios, although strictly speaking<br/>they may apply to either. Thus &quot;a harmonic flavor of trine&quot; suggests<br/>6:4:3, while &quot;an arithmetic flavor&quot; suggests 4:3:2 -- and likewise<br/>15:12:10 and 6:5:4 for harmonic and arithmetic 5-limit triads.</p><p>However, when desired, we may speak of harmonic/arithmetic<br/>frequency-ratios as well as string-ratios -- with an understanding<br/>that a harmonic string-ratio division is equivalent to a corresponding<br/>arithmetic frequency-ratio, and vice versa. Thus 6:4:3 is equivalent<br/>to 2:3:4, and 3:4:6 to 4:3:2 -- and likewise 15:12:10 to 4:5:6, and<br/>6:5:4 to 10:12:15.</p><p>Here I should emphasize that the more traditional harmonic/arithmatic<br/>contrast and the newer &quot;mean-frequency/mean-string&quot; contrast may<br/>provide congenial approaches to various historical as well as current<br/>musics, without in any way excluding other approaches which may better<br/>fit some musical contexts and styles.</p><p>For example, a Partchian outlook based on &quot;otonality/utonality&quot; and<br/>&quot;undertones&quot; might ideally fit not only Partch&apos;s own styles of music,<br/>but other styles which share such related concepts as &quot;major/minor<br/>tonality.&quot; However, this outlook may make certain assumptions which<br/>may not fit so well the early 5-limit music of around 1450-1650, let<br/>alone the 3-limit trinic music of the 13th and 14th centuries.</p><p>An awareness of the musical assumptions implied by different systems<br/>and conventions may promote a fuller appreciation not only of the<br/>systems but of the music which the systems seek to explicate, an<br/>attractive incentive for more dialogue on the Tuning List.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
