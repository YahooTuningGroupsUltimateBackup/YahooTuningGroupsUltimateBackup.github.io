It gives you a symmetrical<br/>&gt;&gt; decatonic scale if you avoid B and F, and it gives you two different<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachordal decatonic scales if you avoid either (B and E) or (C and F).</p><p>Joseph wrote,</p><p>&gt;Manuel op de Coul was kind enough to send me the recent mapping file<br/>&gt;which leaves the &quot;B&apos;s&quot; unmapped, so I will enjoy experimenting with<br/>&gt;this...</p><p>&gt;Thanks!</p><p>That&apos;s not was I was talking about.

For me, having an interval all the same number of scale degrees<br/>throughout is much more important. Whereas I can play minor 9th anywhere on the keyboard to<br/>play a fifth, a major ninths from Bb to C or Eb to F is very hard for me to play. I tried<br/>skipping keys, it didn&apos;t work or make sense to having the same ratio a different keysize.<br/>Nothing logical about it to me, sorry. We also have different 22 tone scale. I hope to put up<br/>soon the various ways it can br mapped onto a Bosanquet.</p><p>&quot;Paul H.
