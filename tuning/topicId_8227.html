The internet has shrunk the world to the size<br/>of a pea.</p><p>&gt; Consonance is a great<br/>&gt; ideal, but dissonance is much more common.</p><p>In art (and in life, I would think), dissonance is where the meaning is.<br/>Pure consonance is pure meaninglessness. (I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to enjoy<br/>heaven very much.)</p><p>&gt; I hope we on the list can handle<br/>&gt; the recurring dissonance.</p><p>If we will separate the substantive dissonance from the frivolous and<br/>emotional dissonance, I think we can.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s usually just a misunderstanding resulting in<br/>&gt; frustration.</p><p>After 44 years of marriage, I know this to be true. The trick is to find out<br/>what the other person _really_ meant.</p><p>&gt; Since we all mean well,</p><p>An excellent assumption.</p><p>&gt; lets move on.</p><p>We shall!</p><p>Thanks for the inspirational input, Johnny.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
