Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2000 2:58:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like to try briefly to address some of the<br/>remarks about Zarlino and the syntonic diatonic tuning, which can be<br/>applied either to the variety of modes prevailing in the 16th century,<br/>or to the major/minor system which emerged in the later part of the<br/>17th century, as Kirnberger (1771) and others did -- partially, and<br/>&quot;in theory.&quot;</p><p>First of all, while it is a commonplace of musical history that<br/>Zarlino was &quot;the first to address triads rather than intervals,&quot; this<br/>statement may create the misleading impression that Zarlino was the<br/>first to address combinations of three or more voices, a feature of<br/>Gothic theory also (e.g. Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous I, c. 1290 or 1300;<br/>AnonymousJohannes de Grocheio, c. 1300; Jacobus of Liege, c. 1325;<br/>Johannes Boen, 1357).</p><p>What Zarlino did do was to address saturated _5-limit_ triads in the<br/>Erlichan sense of three-voice combinations of &quot;third plus fifth or<br/>sixth&quot; -- in other words, combinations with an outer fifth plus a<br/>major and minor third, or an outer sixth plus a major or minor third<br/>and a fourth. Zarlino describes such saturated combinations as<br/>representing _harmonia perfetta_ or &quot;complete harmony,&quot; as they do in<br/>a 5-limit context.</p><p>In fact, in a Gothic 3-limit context, theorists around 1290-1357<br/>discuss stable three-voice trines (outer octave, lower fifth, and<br/>upper fourth -- or the converse arrangement with the fourth below the<br/>fifth), and Anonymous I and Jacobus find the arrangement with the<br/>fifth below and the fourth above more smooth and pleasing.</p><p>Johannes de Grocheio says that it takes _three_ voices to &quot;perfect a<br/>consonance,&quot; e.g. D3-A3-D4 (MIDI notation with C4 as middle C), and<br/>describes this trinic sonority as _consonantia perfectissma_ or &quot;most<br/>perfect consonance&quot; -- a very similar description to Zarlino&apos;s 5-limit<br/>_harmonia perfetta_ about 250 years later.</p><p>Anonymous I and Jacobus additionally note that the bare major ninth<br/>(9:4) &quot;seems to concord better&quot; when a middle voice is added to<br/>produce 9:6:4 (or, in frequency-ratio terms, 4:6:9) with two<br/>concordant fifths, e.g. F3-C4-G4. They are addressing what Paul might<br/>call &quot;triadic harmonic entropy,&quot; and going beyond a theory of simple<br/>intervals or dyads.</p><p>In discussing the unstable _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; sonority<br/>where an outer fifth is &quot;split&quot; by a third voice into a ditone or<br/>major third and a semiditone or minor third, Jacobus expresses a<br/>preference for the former arrangement but notes that the latter is<br/>also used, e.g. A3-C4-E4, the opening sonority in a 13th-century motet<br/>which he cites and is happy preserved in the Bamberg and Montpellier<br/>Codices for our admiration.</p><p>Note that Jacobus discusses these three-voice sonorities in a setting<br/>where they are _unstable_ 3-limit combinations, in contrast to<br/>Zarlino&apos;s stable 5-limit _harmonia perfetta_ involving the same types<br/>of intervals (in 5-limit JI or meantone, rather than Gothic<br/>Pythagorean). This is the distinction between medieval theory and<br/>Zarlino: both discuss three-voice combinations, but in different<br/>systems of musical and intonational practice and theory.</p><p>Around 1357, Johannes Boen (in a &quot;modern&quot; 14th-century stylistic<br/>setting) finds the tritone or diminished fourth dissonant in itself,<br/>but a consonance &quot;by situation&quot; (_per accidens_) in a sonority such as<br/>D3-F3-B3 (tritone with minor third below) or E3-G#3-C4 (diminished<br/>fourth with major third below). Again, this clearly goes beyond a<br/>theory of simple intervals or dyads, and within a 3-limit setting as<br/>opposed to Zarlino&apos;s 5-limit system.</p><p>Recognizing these Gothic 3-limit theories of complete stable trines,<br/>and also of &quot;triadic harmonic entropy&quot; as we might term it for some<br/>unstable sonorities, doesn&apos;t in any way diminish Zarlino&apos;s<br/>accomplishments in describing _5-limit_ sonorities.</p><p>As for the syntonic diatonic, Zarlino himself indeed credits it to<br/>Ptolemy, and Fogliano (1529) provided an earlier 5-limit use of this<br/>scheme in the new stylistic setting of the 16th century to obtain pure<br/>major and minor thirds at 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>Note that Zarlino&apos;s basic scheme might best be defined in terms of<br/>solmization syllables: 9:8 whole-tones appear immediately above mi-fa<br/>semitones, and also at A-B, leaving 10:9 whole-tones at other<br/>locations. The solmization system, with its hexachords, can be used to<br/>sing in any of the 12 modes recognized by Zarlino, following Glareanus<br/>(1547). A diatonic semitone is always sung mi-fa, and &quot;mutations&quot; from<br/>one hexachord to another are required to cover a complete octave, as<br/>here from the natural (C-A) to the &quot;hard&quot; (G-E) hexachord:</p><p>      C       D       E    F       G       A        B    C<br/>      ut      re      mi   fa     sol      re       mi   fa<br/>         9:8     10:9  16:15  9:8     10:9     9:8   16:15</p><p>People curious about solmization and hexachords might visit:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html</a></p><p>Paul, you are quite correct that Zarlino regards temperament much more<br/>practical for keyboard instruments, and champions 2/7-comma meantone<br/>(1558), although in 1571 he additionally recognizes that 1/4-comma<br/>meantone is pleasant and easy to tune, and somewhere as I recall<br/>describes 1/3-comma as &quot;somewhat languid.&quot; For the lute, as I recall,<br/>he follows the consensus of middle to late 16th-century theory and<br/>favors 12-tone equal temperament (12-tET).</p><p>It is for unaccompanied singers that Zarlino regards 5-limit JI (the<br/>syntonic diatonic) as the best model, and it&apos;s an interesting question<br/>how he might view an adaptive JI system such as Vicentino&apos;s. He also<br/>describes a 16-note classic JI keyboard (two D&apos;s, Bb&apos;s, Eb&apos;s, and<br/>F#&apos;s), but recognizes that it is difficult to play, and favors<br/>meantone in practice.</p><p>For Zarlino, there are 12 modes, with the Ionian mode (C-C) regarded<br/>by 1573 or so as &quot;first among equals,&quot; as one might say. However,<br/>16th-century Ionian is not the same thing as major tonality, because<br/>the late 17th-century constraints of key don&apos;t apply. Beautiful<br/>3-limit progressions such as M3-5 by contrary motion continue to guide<br/>motion in the new setting of textures moving between saturated 5-limit<br/>sonorities. Degrees such as B/Bb and F/F# are fluid and flexible in<br/>various modes, including Ionian. These comments apply to early<br/>17th-century music also.</p><p>As the Monz has correctly observed, the German theorist Johannes<br/>Lippius (1610, 1612) followed Zarlino both in advocating Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>syntonic diatonic and in much of his approach to the 12 modes.<br/>Additionally, he made Zarlino&apos;s 5-limit _harmonia perfetta_ the<br/>centerpiece of his approach to music, both theological and practical,<br/>apparently coining the term _trias harmonica_ or &quot;harmonic triad&quot; for<br/>a saturated 5-limit sonority.</p><p>At any rate, I&apos;m quite confident that Zarlino would _not_ consider<br/>40:27 an appropriate tuning for the main fifth of the Dorian mode<br/>(D-A), a mode being largely defined by its consonant species of fifth<br/>and fourth, so his JI scheme is more a model than a fixed &quot;scale.&quot;</p><p>Although earlier authors, especially Fogliano and Vicentino (1555), had<br/>discussed 5-limit JI and Ptolemy, Zarlino does deserve to have this<br/>tuning system associated with his name, given his rich contributions<br/>to the art, including his comparison of 5-limit saturated sonorities.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that in 1771, Kirnberger describes two ideal tuning<br/>systems: the &quot;modern&quot; system of Zarlino, and the older one of<br/>Pythagoras. At the same time, he notes that singers must sometimes<br/>make compromises, and like Zarlino endorses temperament for keyboard<br/>instruments (in Kirnberger&apos;s case, unequal well-temperament with its<br/>distinctions of keys).</p><p>As far as Zarlino&apos;s championship of _diatonic_ music goes, he indeed<br/>argues in his _Harmonic Institutions_ of 1558 that the diatonic genus<br/>is basic to modern polyphonic music in the various modes, unlike the<br/>situation with Greek music (presumably monophonic for the most part)<br/>where the chromatic or enharmonic genus could have been used to better<br/>effect.</p><p>In attacking the &quot;chromaticists&quot; -- likely Vicentino in particular --<br/>he argues that intervals such as the chromatic semitone or enharmonic<br/>diesis must have a bad effect in polyphony because they are<br/>disproportionate to the proper vertical concords. He also argues --<br/>taking the same position as Lusitano in the Vicentino/Lusitano<br/>disputation of a few years earlier (1551?) -- that the mere use of a<br/>melodic minor third or major third does not change the genus from<br/>diatonic to chromatic or enharmonic, as claimed by the &quot;chromaticists&quot;<br/>(specifically the unnamed Vicentino).</p><p>This does not mean that Zarlino is opposed to the use of accidentals,<br/>which he finds indispensable (for example to make a sixth major before<br/>an octave), only that such accidentalism should have what he considers<br/>a &quot;reasonable&quot; or &quot;justifiable&quot; basis. He clearly takes the view that<br/>the &quot;chromaticists&quot; have gone beyond such bounds.</p><p>In short, Zarlino (1558) is the first theorist to discuss and analyze<br/>multi-voice combinations at length in a _5-limit_ setting, in contrast<br/>to a Gothic 3-limit setting, although brief remarks in the earlier<br/>treatise of Vicentino (1555) urge a &quot;richness of harmony&quot; based on<br/>guidelines which essentially prescribe saturated 5-limit sonorities.<br/>He champions both the syntonic feature of Ptolemy&apos;s tuning (the pure<br/>5-based ratios) and the diatonic genus as the norm in polyphonic music,<br/>based on a system of 12 modes.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2000 5:05:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
