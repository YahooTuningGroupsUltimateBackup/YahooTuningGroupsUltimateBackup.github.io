What an awesome thing. Major<br/>kudos to Erv Wilson.</p><p>I have to say that neither Monz&apos;s dictionary entries nor Kraig&apos;s web pages<br/>did it for me, although they helped. It was Paul Erlich&apos;s simple<br/>explanation that made it click. My how easily something so simple in<br/>concept (but not in conception) can be obscured.</p><p>The hard part for me was that I was looking for how one generates _ratios_<br/>for the pitches. But in fact one doesn&apos;t. One simply generates _integers_.<br/>And (in general) no note corresponds to 1. Of course these integers can<br/>become ratios by scaling them all by the same amount or by scaling them to<br/>the same octave.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t help thinking, hey this eikosany thing is at least 4<br/>dimensional, assuming products of 3 at a time from {1,3,5,7,9,11}) so it<br/>sure suffers when mapped to 2 dimensions, whether in Wilson&apos;s<br/>10-star-inside-a-10-gon diagram or his bosanquet-style keyboard mapping.</p><p>I want it mapped to the surface of a donut. One just large enough to get my<br/>fingers inside, with 20 buttons distributed over the surface. To see how to<br/>map it, just take the standard 10-star-inside-a-10-gon diagram and raise<br/>every second note of the star above the page while lowering the others. the<br/>outer decagon can get a bit zig-zaggy too.</p><p>You can build this approximately in zometool but it&apos;s too big (with 10 long<br/>reds in the middle, 10 medium yellows around the outside and 10 short reds<br/>joining them).</p><p>I would limit it to 20 notes, but not to one octave (about 2.5 octaves) as<br/>follows. Simply take products of 3 at a time from {4,5,6,7,9,11} and don&apos;t<br/>reduce them to the same octave. The &quot;scale&quot; would have no octave but it<br/>would be a brilliant toy to let people hear the maximum number of different<br/>types of 11-limit consonance with the fewest notes (?), even if it was just<br/>some cheesy battery operated thing that only did sawtooth waves with no<br/>dynamics.</p><p>I&apos;ve also looked at microtempering it (distributing the 224:225 and<br/>384:385). By my rough count this would add about 17 additional dyads to the<br/>already 96 (?). This may complete some pentads. Eikosanies are normally<br/>limited to tetrads (for complete pairwise consonance).</p><p>This microtempering would avoid phase-locking and would only introduce<br/>    1.1 c errors in the 2:3&apos;s,<br/>max 3.2 c errors in ratios of 5,<br/>max 2.4 c errors in ratios of 7,<br/>max 2.1 c errors in ratios of 9,<br/>max 1.6 c errors in ratios of 11.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2000 10:24:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David C Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; I couldn&apos;t help thinking, hey this eikosany thing is at least 4<br/>&gt; dimensional, assuming products of 3 at a time from {1,3,5,7,9,11}) so it<br/>&gt; sure suffers when mapped to 2 dimensions, whether in Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt; 10-star-inside-a-10-gon diagram or his bosanquet-style keyboard mapping.</p><p>Erv stated that it was 12 dimensional In that it should look like a donut from 12 different<br/>directions</p><p>&gt; I would limit it to 20 notes, but not to one octave (about 2.5 octaves) as<br/>&gt; follows.
