Ramos finds such<br/>a scheme inclined toward discord rather than harmony -- which might be<br/>taken as another bit of evidence that he&apos;s discussing some kind of<br/>meantone keyboard rather the popular 15th-century Pythagorean scheme<br/>with a Wolf at B-Gb (written B-F#).</p><p>Incidentally, while your FAQ focuses on actual known instruments, mine<br/>will focus more on theory and possible musical applications, since<br/>various 15th-century theorists discuss 13-17 note tunings or keyboards<br/>in some form of Pythagorean tuning, but at least as of Mark Lindley&apos;s<br/>article of 1980, no examples of actually constructed instruments were<br/>known.</p><p>As for the Lucca organ, please let me admit that I cannot match your<br/>scholarship and knowledge of sources in this area; my information is<br/>based only on discussions by Mark Lindley. However, the source which<br/>he quotes, if accurate, does offer a fairly clear answer to the<br/>question of which accidentals were included, and gives at least a hint<br/>as to a likely arrangement of the split keys. He I quote Lindley&apos;s<br/>text and translation[1], adding two notes:</p><p>inoltre li tasti soprascritto   In addition to the above-mentioned keys,<br/>la tersa del b quadro           the third above B-natural{1}<br/>et la tersa del fa delle f      and the minor third above F{2}<br/>et insieme cum li loro octavi   together with their octaves<br/>uve saranno necessarij          where necessary.</p><p> 1. Here Lindley translates _b quadro_ in the English manner as<br/>&quot;B-natural&quot;; this is &quot;square-B&quot; or B-mi, a symbol providing the<br/>origins of both the natural and sharp signs, and also the Germanic H<br/>still used to represent English &quot;B-natural,&quot; with Germanic B showing<br/>Bb (the &quot;round-B&quot; of medieval notation, and the origin of the flat<br/>sign). On these signs and their origins in medieval hexachord theory,<br/>see, for example, <a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html</a>.</p><p>2. Here Lindley translates _tersa del fa_ as minor third; we might<br/>also say &quot;flat third,&quot; the third above F notated with a fa-sign or<br/>flat, i.e. Ab.</p><p>As Lindley explains, this is a 14-note instrument with D# and Ab as<br/>the extra notes.</p><p>To me, at least, the viewing of these notes as the extra ones might<br/>suggest an arrangement of Eb/D# and G#/Ab, the one that becomes<br/>standard in the 16th century (along with Eb-G# as the usual 12-note<br/>tuning).</p><p>My crude musical information, not grounded I would emphasize in your<br/>kind of knowledge of these instruments and their distributions of<br/>notes in various countries and eras, would be that Bb/A# might be a<br/>less likely choice in this early meantone era, as opposed to the<br/>mid-16th century.</p><p>Please forgive me for what may be a bit of a digression on the<br/>possible earlier 15th-century Pythagorean role of A#; as Ramos<br/>suggests, the issues in early meantone would have been somewhat<br/>different, and in fact Lindley focuses on some musical differences in<br/>persuasively (at least for me) demonstrating that Ramos was discussing<br/>a keyboard in meantone.</p><p>In the early 15th-century schemes of Prosdocimus of Beldemandis for a<br/>17-note monochord (1413), and of Ugolino of Orvieto (2nd quarter of<br/>15th century) for a 17-note organ, the range of Gb-A# does include<br/>both notes, but A# seems maybe the least important, since one of<br/>Ugolino&apos;s 12-note monochords has four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#) but Bb.</p><p>Here a distinction may be that Bb is a _musica recta_ note, part of<br/>the regular medieval gamut, while the other accidentals are _musica<br/>ficta_ or &quot;contrived notes&quot; outside this gamut. However, both<br/>Prosdocimus and Ugolino do include A# as well in their full 17-note<br/>tunings.</p><p>This is not a &quot;scientific&quot; observation, nor evidence on how<br/>15th-century musicians or instrument builders may have viewed things,<br/>but in performing early 15th-century music on a Pythagorean keyboard I<br/>have found occasion to use every note on a Gb-D# instrument, but at<br/>least to me, A# seems of mostly theoretical interest. If I were<br/>improvising or composing my own music, of course, I could use A# for<br/>more remote transpositions of cadences, and also for more cadential<br/>choices: e.g. F#3-A#3-D#4 in a cadence with ascending semitones to<br/>E3-B3-E4; or a cadence from E3-G#4-C#4 to D#3-A#3-D#4 (with descending<br/>semitone in lowest voice) rather than to the usual D3-A3-D4 (with<br/>ascending semitones).</p><p>Lindley does present evidence in another article that one German organ<br/>collection, the Breslau manuscript (I.F. 687) dating around 1430, may<br/>have been written for a 12-note instrument with five sharps, that is<br/>an F-A# tuning, with A#-D (written Bb-D) as a schisma third; but he<br/>comments that this proposal would not seem very popular, because Bb is<br/>a very common _musica recta_ note (Bb/B or B/H, Bfa/Bmi, both being<br/>integral forms of this step in the standard gamut).</p><p>Having a Wolf at the frequently used fifth Bb-F (here tuned A#-F)<br/>would cause problems with a very large proportion of the usual<br/>repertory, although Lindley notes that the collection he describes<br/>cleverly avoids this problem by often using the written third Bb-D<br/>(played A#-D, the schisma third of 8192:6561 or ~384.36 cents, only<br/>~1.95 cents narrower than a pure 5:4) without a fifth.[2]</p><p>If this five-sharps scheme had become more popular in the early 15th<br/>century, then A#/Bb might have become the most common Pythagorean<br/>split key scheme with 13 notes.</p><p>Returning to the meantone era, my impression is that A# may come into<br/>vogue by around 1550: Orlando di Lasso uses it often in his<br/>_Prophetiae Sibyllum_, and for the Prologue of this collection (which<br/>I might assign to the Eighth Mode, or G Hypomixolydian), I have used a<br/>14-note scheme of Eb-A#.</p><p>However, since I am not familiar with the earlier 16th-century<br/>experiments in remote accidentalism, I would want to speak with some<br/>caution here.</p><p>Anyway, if Lindley&apos;s Italian source is correct, the Lucca organ of<br/>1480 had Eb-G# plus D# and Ab, with a hint of Eb/D# and G#/Ab if we<br/>assume that the notes considered part of the &quot;usual&quot; 12-note set would<br/>likely be placed in front.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

Since meantone tunings<br/>involve the narrowing of the fifths by a fraction of the comma, a more<br/>precise formulation than &quot;a small and hidden amount&quot; might require new<br/>developments in theory reflecting the new practice.</p><p>With Aaron&apos;s _Toscanello_ (1523), and with Vicentino&apos;s descriptions of<br/>his archicembalo (1555) and arciorgano (1561), theory in this specific<br/>aspect still seems quite imprecise. While even the cautious Mark<br/>Lindley appears to imply that the _Toscanello_ instructions do set up<br/>the first five notes as the pure major third C-E divided into four<br/>equally tempered fifths (C-G-D-A-E), these instructions say nothing<br/>about commas or ratios.</p><p>In his treatise of 1577, Francisco Salinas tells us that during his<br/>younger years in Rome (around 1538), he was known as the inventor of<br/>1/4-comma meantone. Possibly Salinas did develop a precise<br/>mathematical formulation during his youth, and one might be tempted to<br/>wonder whether the just intonation system of Lodovico Fogliano (1529)<br/>with its discussion of the syntonic comma might have stimulated such a<br/>quantitative approach to temperament. However, he did not _publish_ at<br/>that time, and in 1577 he acknowledges and agrees with Zarlino&apos;s<br/>formulation of 1571.</p><p>In his _Ancient Music Adapted to Modern Practice_ (1555), Vicentino<br/>describes his archicembalo temperament as a division of the octave<br/>into 31 parts, and of the tone into five such parts, each called a<br/>minor diesis. He describes the minor (chromatic) and major (diatonic)<br/>semitones as consisting of 2/5-tone and 3/5-tone respectively. The<br/>tuning is circular: all intervals are available from all notes.</p><p>In his advertisement of 1561 for his arciorgano, Vicentino likewise<br/>notes that one may begin a piece of music on any step of the<br/>instrument; he further describes what appears to be the same as his<br/>alternative &quot;pure fifths&quot; tuning of 1555 for the archicembalo, a<br/>tuning combining &quot;perfect fifths&quot; with &quot;perfect thirds,&quot; in other<br/>words, adaptive just intonation.</p><p>If we take Zarlino&apos;s announcement of his &quot;new&quot; 1/4-comma temperament<br/>as an assertion that &quot;nothing like this has previously been tuned,&quot;<br/>and especially if we take such a reading of Zarlino as a conclusive<br/>statement of fact, then the interpretation of Vicentino&apos;s scheme<br/>raises some perplexing problems.</p><p>If his archicembalo divides the octave into a circulating system of 31<br/>dieses, then the fifths must have at least an _average_ size quite<br/>close to 10/31 octave, which in turn is a measurement very close to<br/>that of a fifth tempered by 1/4 syntonic comma.</p><p>Similarly, if his arciorgano offers &quot;perfect fifths&quot; and &quot;perfect<br/>thirds&quot; in an adaptive JI tuning, then some of those intervals very<br/>likely are derived from the usual tuning of the first manual, which<br/>Vicentino has described in his treatise of 1555 as the usual common<br/>practice tuning with the fifths slightly &quot;blunted&quot; or &quot;foreshortened&quot;<br/>(i.e. meantone). Since this same first manual can also be the basis of<br/>a 31-note circulating scheme (rather than one of 19 notes), pure major<br/>thirds rather than pure minor thirds on this manual seem implied.</p><p>To reason that since Zarlino declared his 1/4-comma temperament was<br/>&quot;new&quot; in 1571, therefore Vicentino could not have tuned something<br/>substantially identical in 1555 or 1561, might well require setting<br/>aside the basic laws of acoustics and mathematics -- or proposing that<br/>Vicentino&apos;s scheme was actually realized as a kind of appreciably<br/>unequal 31-note well-temperament.</p><p>However, Vicentino&apos;s writings may also illustrate precisely how<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 1/4-comma temperament of 1571 was &quot;new&quot;: we might consider<br/>not only what Vicentino says and implies about his keyboard tunings,<br/>but what he does _not_ say.</p><p>Nowhere does Vicentino define anything like &quot;1/4-comma meantone,&quot; nor<br/>does he say anything about measuring meantone temperaments in terms of<br/>fractional commas. Like Gaffurius 61 years earlier, he describes the<br/>&quot;foreshortening&quot; of the fifths; for Vicentino, this _participatio_ or<br/>tempering is indeed one of the two distinguishing characteristics of<br/>modern common practice music, together with what he views as a<br/>&quot;mixing&quot; of the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera (_musica<br/>participata &amp; mista_).</p><p>However, while Vicentino espouses temperament, discusses it, and<br/>describes some of the resulting features of his keyboard tunings (a<br/>circulating 31-note fifthtone system, or an adaptive JI system with<br/>sonorities featuring pure fifths and thirds), he does not _define_ the<br/>amount of temperament he uses, or divide the comma into fractional<br/>parts.</p><p>Rather than splitting the syntonic comma in the manner of Zarlino and<br/>Salinas, Vicentino &quot;splits&quot; his definition of the term &quot;comma&quot; itself:<br/>its meanings can include either the syntonic comma of 81:80, or half<br/>of his &quot;minor diesis&quot; or fifthtone, roughly the same size[1]; or the<br/>amount by which a fifth is tempered.</p><p>These multiple uses of the term &quot;comma&quot; have caused considerable<br/>confusion for modern scholars such as Barbour and Kaufmann: we<br/>apparently must take the term in the sense of &quot;the amount by which the<br/>fifth is tempered&quot; to understand his adaptive JI system with &quot;perfect<br/>fifths&quot; -- that is, fifths a &quot;comma&quot; wider than the usual tempered<br/>ones. Here a size of around 702 cents, rather than 716 cents, is<br/>evidently intended.</p><p>The laws of &quot;musical geometry&quot; suggest this &quot;comma&quot; of Vicentino was<br/>very close to the &quot;1/4-comma&quot; of Zarlino, but in the writings of<br/>Vicentino himself it is, to paraphrase Gafurius, a small and<br/>mathematically undefined amount.</p><p>The first mathematical definition, at least in print, was Zarlino&apos;s;<br/>in 1558 he had been the first to split the comma and specify his<br/>2/7-comma temperament in this elegant and precise manner, and in 1571<br/>he applied this method to the &quot;new&quot; formulation of 1/4-comma with its<br/>pure major thirds.</p><p>It remains a moot question whether by his announcement of this<br/>temperament as &quot;new&quot; Zarlino meant to imply that the _sound_ of a<br/>keyboard instrument in a regular tuning with pure or virtually pure<br/>major thirds was itself new (at least to him), or whether he simply<br/>meant such a _formulated_ tempering scheme, recognized and specified,<br/>was being presented for the first time.</p><p>However we interpret Zarlino&apos;s intended meaning, his philosopical view<br/>of music as a science which should have consistent laws and results<br/>might well serve as the basis for an argument that &quot;1/4-comma<br/>meantone&quot; had not really been &quot;discovered&quot; until it was _defined_.</p><p>On the theme of consistency, for example, Zarlino asserted that a<br/>sixth expanding to an octave should _always_ be major, apart from some<br/>narrow exceptions, because this was its nature, and that to permit it<br/>to be either major or minor would be to imitate the mistaken approach<br/>to medicine of those who treat every disease with the same remedy. He<br/>also asserts that even &quot;peasants&quot; in their singing use the major sixth<br/>before an octave, thus demonstrating the &quot;natural&quot; basis of this law.</p><p>Looking at some actual early to middle 16th-century tablatures of<br/>instrumental pieces indicating precise semitones, as Robert Toft has<br/>done[2], will show that some of Zarlino&apos;s contemporaries felt free<br/>either to alter a minor sixth to major before an octave in line with<br/>the usual rule of &quot;closest approach,&quot; or at times to leave it<br/>unaltered, the latter choice being a frequent &quot;custom&quot; in some German<br/>practices.</p><p>If Zarlino&apos;s &quot;natural&quot; laws of counterpoint in 1558 did not<br/>necessarily reflect practices in all parts of Western Europe -- and<br/>given the diversity of musical styles and &quot;dialects,&quot; we should hardly<br/>ask this of any theorist -- then his announcement in 1571 of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone as a &quot;new&quot; temperament, however read, need not necessarily be<br/>taken to imply the absence of a tuning with a substantially similar or<br/>identical _sound_ in 1523, 1538, or 1555.</p><p>In fact, if asked to guess when a meantone featuring pure or virtually<br/>pure major thirds may first have been tuned, I would lean more toward<br/>1471 than 1571 -- also noting, as does Lindley, that such temperaments<br/>may have varied considerably in their degree of regularity, a feature<br/>of Zarlino&apos;s mathematical model but not necessarily of the models and<br/>methods used by tuners during these many decades.</p><p>However, to say that schemes with pure or virtually pure major thirds<br/>were _tuned_, and that Vicentino&apos;s 31-note cycle logically implies or<br/>even entails such a scheme (at least if we assume the degree of<br/>regularity his description seems to suggest), is not to say that<br/>&quot;1/4-comma temperament&quot; was widely known or defined before 1571,<br/>although Salinas suggests that it was known in about these terms in<br/>some Roman circles during his residence there as a young musician.</p><p>Here Zarlino&apos;s rightful place in the history of temperament may be<br/>like that of Galileo&apos;s in the history of the physics of acceleration:<br/>both formulated elegant and mathematically precise models which<br/>earlier precedents do not render less &quot;new&quot; and significant.</p><p>Around 1545, with some earlier precedents in the scholastic physics<br/>of 14th-century Oxford and Paris, Domingo de Soto stated the &quot;mean<br/>speed&quot; theory that falling objects accelerate at a uniform rate.<br/>However, it was left for Galileo to test this model by experiment with<br/>his famous inclined planes, and to formulate it in an elegant<br/>mathematical fashion in his dialogues of 1632 and 1638.</p><p>Similarly, in 1523, Aaron&apos;s _Toscanello_ seems in persuasive and<br/>sometimes poetic language to demonstrate how a pure 5:4 major third as<br/>&quot;sonorous and just&quot; as possible can be divided into four equal fifths,<br/>each tempered by the same amount in the narrow direction. However, it<br/>mentions neither the ratio of 5:4, nor the syntonic comma, nor the<br/>quantity by which each fifth is tempered (Zarlino&apos;s &quot;1/4-comma&quot;).</p><p>Zarlino, like Galileo, presents a mathematical formulation in which<br/>the relevant parameters are both recognized and defined -- first in<br/>his account of 2/7-comma temperament in 1558, then in his application<br/>of the same approach to 1/4-comma and 1/3-comma in 1571.</p><p>Is this &quot;discovery&quot; a mere theoretical nicety, or something with vital<br/>practical implications also?</p><p>As already suggested, I would not read Zarlino&apos;s announcement of 1571<br/>as evidence that keyboard tunings with pure or virtually pure major<br/>thirds had previously been unknown in Europe. However, I would take<br/>his statement and formulation -- as well as what is _not_ formulated<br/>in earlier instructions or descriptions by Aaron and Vicentino -- as<br/>evidence for a &quot;new&quot; kind of tuning worldview.</p><p>In envisioning the tuning practices of European musicians from Conrad<br/>von Paumann (c. 1450) to Vicentino and his contemporaries, we may find<br/>it all too easy to imagine tuners setting up regular temperaments in<br/>terms of fractions of a comma. After all, this is the &quot;meantone<br/>model,&quot; a model it seems natural to associate with this category of<br/>tuning.</p><p>Such a view of history may capture one facet of the first century or a<br/>bit more of meantone: the use of various shades of temperament. It may<br/>not, however, capture another facet: the impressionistic and not<br/>necessarily so regular nature of the tuning process, a facet which the<br/>&quot;small and hidden amount&quot; of temperament described by Gafurius may put<br/>into words better than the fractional comma models of Zarlino.</p><p>This is likely a world of blurred, or more positively stated,<br/>&quot;flexible&quot; distinctions and boundaries; for example, a scheme such as<br/>Arnold Schlick&apos;s of 1511 might be described as either a modified<br/>meantone tuning or a kind of marginal &quot;semi-well-temperament.&quot;</p><p>While I am inclined to conclude that a natural reading of the<br/>_Toscanello_ instructions of 1523 would at least _invite_ a tuning<br/>with pure or near-pure major thirds, and that Vicentino&apos;s parameters<br/>of 1555 or 1561 come close to entailing such a result, I am also now<br/>inclined to say that describing such a result as &quot;1/4-comma meantone&quot;<br/>may be a conceptual anachronism, although a close muslcal equivalence.</p><p>Here is the kind of formuation toward which I would now lean:</p><p>&quot;Meantone tunings with pure or virtually pure thirds could have been<br/>and likely were used in various times and places between the advent of<br/>meantone as a common practice around 1450-1480 and Zarlino&apos;s<br/>mathematical definition of such a tuning in 1571.</p><p>&quot;However, we should not assume that such a shade of meantone was a<br/>&apos;standard,&apos; much less that tuners during these many decades conceived<br/>of the tuning process in terms of fractions of a comma. Nor, as Mark<br/>Lindley has wisely cautioned, should we assume that absolute<br/>regularity was a general ideal of the time in theory or practice.</p><p>&quot;Zarlino&apos;s precise definitions of 2/7-comma meantone in 1558, and of<br/>1/4-comma and 1/3-comma temperaments in 1571, for the first time (at<br/>least in print) did establish systematic models of regular<br/>temperaments. Earlier theorists had described the tempering process<br/>(e.g. Aaron&apos;s _Toscanello of 1523), or had described results implying<br/>a certain approximate shade of temperament (e.g. Vicentino&apos;s 31-note<br/>archicembalo cycle of 1555, suggesting pure or virtually pure major<br/>thirds), but Zarlino _specified_ and _defined_ it.</p><p>&quot;For these reasons, if we wish to capture something of the empirical<br/>and flexible temperament practices of meantone&apos;s first century or a<br/>bit more, we might do well to speak in terms of general shades of<br/>temperament (e.g. &grave;major thirds pure or close to pure,&apos; or &grave;major<br/>thirds somewhat wider than pure&apos;) rather than in terms of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>fractional commas.</p><p>&quot;It is perhaps a special tribute to Zarlino that his fractional comma<br/>measurements seem so natural that they have become, in effect, an<br/>integral part of the conception of &grave;meantone.&apos;&quot;</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. The syntonic comma of 81:80 is about 21.51 cents, and Vicentino&apos;s<br/>discussion of JI ratios may be based on that of Fogliano; Vicentino&apos;s<br/>comma equal to half of a minor diesis or fifthtone, or about<br/>1/10-tone, would have a size of around 20.53 cents if we take the<br/>diesis to approximate the 128:125 ratio (~41.06 cents) found in JI or<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 1/4-comma meantone, or around 19.35 cents if we take it<br/>approximate 1/31 octave (~38.70 cents) as defined in 17th-century<br/>formulations by Lemme Rossi and Christiaan Huygens of 31-tone equal<br/>temperament (31-tET).</p><p>2.
