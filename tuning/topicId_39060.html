This astonished<br/>&gt; even me.  I thought, on being confronted with scales like 13 and 11<br/>&gt; and 23, that I would have mental blocks or would have to skip over<br/>&gt; them with an apologetic short piece and hurry on to the next tuning<br/>&gt; before the listeners get too annoyed.  And yet they all work!<br/>&gt; Absolutely amazed me.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.
