There is<br/>only one known issue - the Midi Yoke and Giga<br/>one for XP. There was one for logic users<br/>but it doesn&apos;t apply any more now that Logic<br/>is Mac only.</p><p>I want to make the situation clear and hope that<br/>people won&apos;t get put off using them. It is the<br/>normal and recommended way to do this in Windows.<br/>For instance if ever this is needed in the<br/>articles about programs in Sound on Sound,<br/>they will recommend one of these loopbacks<br/>as the way to connect programs together.<br/>Similarly in other forums and magazines,<br/>whenever the matter comes up.<br/>It is just how you do it and no-one has<br/>any problems with it apart from the<br/>well known Giga + Midi yoke issue.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2005 4:25:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, if you want to see the contents, use:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/better_midi/better_midi_doc.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/better_midi/better_midi_doc.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
