For example, to read about hedgehog you would go to &quot;Porcupine family&quot;. This is fine and dandy; there are way too many named temperaments for each to get its own article, and it&apos;s better for related ones to be grouped together than for each to get a tiny stub of an article anyway.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve noticed that when linking to a specific temperament, it&apos;s often done by a pipelink (i.e. a link with the text &quot;hedgehog&quot; that goes to &quot;Porcupine family&quot;). The trouble with this is that if somebody eventually does break out hedgehog into its own fleshed-out article (which I can easily imagine happening), then all those links ought to go to &quot;Hedgehog&quot; but they&apos;ll still go to &quot;Porcupine family&quot; until somebody changes all of them individual.</p><p>To avoid this future hassle, it seems to me we should avoid using pipelinks and use redirects instead. I&apos;ve started making a redirect whenever I link to a temperament, but unfortunately on wikispaces I guess you have to be an admin to create a redirect (which seems crazy).</p><p>So if you have an issue with any redirect I&apos;ve made, or have a big batch of redirects you want created, send me a message. But let&apos;s try to future-proof things sooner rather than later.</p><p>BTW, is there any way to redirect to a section anchor on wikispaces?</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2011 5:52:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To avoid this future hassle, it seems to me we should avoid using pipelinks and use redirects instead.

(or whatever&apos;s appropriate) when it&apos;s first mentioned in an article, it<br/>would give noobs like me a clearer sense of the bigger picture (&quot;what the<br/>heck are all these crazy terms!?&quot;), and it avoids most of the redirect<br/>issues Keenan raised. There&apos;s also the option of redlinking [[Hedgehog]]<br/>there, if you think it is likely to have its own article down the road.

Take &quot;Augene&quot;.</p><p>In my proposal:<br/>* If a specific article is not yet written, the user clicks on a link to &quot;Augene&quot;, then they have to click on one more link to get to the specific section in the &quot;Augmented family&quot; article automatically. Extra effort: one click.<br/>* If a specific article has been written, the user clicks a link to &quot;Augene&quot; and goes directly to the specific article. Extra effort: zero.</p><p>In your proposal:<br/>* If a specific article is not yet written, the user clicks on a link to &quot;Augene&quot; and gets redirected to &quot;Augmented family&quot;. But since redirects cannot point to specific sections, they end up at the top of the &quot;Augmented family&quot; article. If they want to get to the section about augene, they have to manually scroll down and find it. Extra effort: scrolling to find the relevant section.<br/>* If a specific article has been written, the user clicks a link to &quot;Augene&quot; and gets redirected to the generic article, which in this case is *not* the most specific relevant information available. If they want to get to the &quot;Augene&quot; article, they have to scroll down, as above, to find the augene section, then click the link located there to get to the &quot;Augene&quot; article. Extra effort: scrolling *plus* an extra click.</p><p>Am I misinterpreting your suggestions somehow? Is there some other reason why your proposal is better?
