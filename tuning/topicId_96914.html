The names Super Major and Blue Minor are serviceable enough for my purposes.</p><p>2. I thought that Tenney Height applied to harmony intervals only and not melodic intervals. Harmony and Melody intervals have different values in my system. My melody formula gives 9/5 a value of 0.622 and gives 7/6 a value of 0.619 so if the formula is correct it would be pretty hard to decide which was better in a listening test, the values being so close to each other. Also my formula has nothing to do with odd or prime limits, these are not a factor and are irrelevant.</p><p>3. I suspected someone would point this out regarding higher than 177 EDOs. I knew about it but didn&apos;t mention it for brevity&apos;s sake. As I said, I tested a melodic interval that was 47 cents wide (a crow) and it definitely sounded sour to me.

Note that I am talking about melodic intervals, two notes played in sequence, not simultaneously. Going from 1/1 to 9/5 sounds sweeter to me than going from 1/1 to 7/6. You might want to test these again yourself. Did you have harmony, not melody, in mind when you posted your comment?</p><p>(3) I suspected that the worst melodic interval would be the midpoint of a &quot;crow&quot; (midway between 48.18855c and 6.7758758c) which is 27.5 cents approximately. I was surprised when I tested it that it didn&apos;t sound as terrible as I expected although it didn&apos;t sound especially good either. I was using a piano voice on my keyboard. Next I tried a few sustained voices (i.e. Church Organ and Chapel Organ) and the sourness was much more obvious. Take any tuning you like where all the notes going up from 1/1 are more than 100 cents higher than 1/1 with one exception: a note that is 27.5 cents above 1/1. Now play 1/1 paired with each note going up (play each pair in sequence) and the 27.5 cents note paired with 1/1 will always sound much worse (intolerable to my ear) in comparison to all the other notes paired with 1/1, whatever they may be (all above 100 cents). Can you find an exception to this rule?</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My formula for a melodic interval is 2/x + 2/y where x and y are less than 256.
