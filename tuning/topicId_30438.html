The MIDI light on the front<br/>of the XL-1 goes on when doing the dump, so I know the data is gettiing<br/>there, but it&apos;s not changing the tuning. I can&apos;t find anything in the<br/>Emu manual or the archives of this group to shed any light on my<br/>problem. I&apos;ve used JI Calc with a TX81Z and it worked flawlessly.<br/>Anyone have any ideas?</p></div>
