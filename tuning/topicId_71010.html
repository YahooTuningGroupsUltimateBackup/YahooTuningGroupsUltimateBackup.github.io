There is a big difference between Lou Harrison and say Kyle Gann. &gt; Organize basically any size interval you want any way you want to. where &gt; is there a problem.</p><p>I see basically two limitations of JI. I wouldn&apos;t call them problems; more constraints, really. Constraints can be useful for inspiration; all tuning systems have them. But the limitations of JI include:</p><p>1. Electronic timbres, which can sound lifeless if you&apos;re not careful, can have issues with partials cancelling or reinforcing each other, resulting in a sort of &quot;mechanical&quot; sound. JI works better with acoustic timbres, where you&apos;ve got two or more sound sources physically separated in space. Slightly detuning intervals -- including octaves -- can help to bring electronic timbres to life and keep separate melodic lines distinct.</p><p>2. Commas. With JI, you need to worry about the various commas and what you can do to avoid them, hide comma shifts, or just take the resulting dissonant intervals as extra spice to flavor the sound. Temperament gives you other options, such as making the commas vanish, shrinking them, enlarging them to a size that works better as a melodic step, or even making them go negative.</p></div><h3><a id=71050 href="#71050">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2007 11:12:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There is no reason JI can&apos;t beat, or be limited to low number ratios.<br/>Some of the most interesting beating music i have heard has been in JI.12 Et hasn&apos;t seem to have a problem with pure octaves on electronic instruments<br/>Whether having one off comma shows up more than having it spread out is all a matter of context.<br/>I have never had a comma problem,often i have found them indispensable musically<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=71051 href="#71051">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2007 11:16:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The problem is numerology.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>All tuning involve numerology. and it is a shame we have to rely on them.<br/>While we now have players that have digital readouts to get what they want these days, there are cultures where we have 13 year old girls tune their instruments by the emotional and poetic means with as much accuracy<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=71065 href="#71065">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2007 7:44:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt; There is no reason JI can&apos;t beat, or be limited to low number ratios.</p><p>By that standard, all electronic music is JI; even floating point numbers are rational.
