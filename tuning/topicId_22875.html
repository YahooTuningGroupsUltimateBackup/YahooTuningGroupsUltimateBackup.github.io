He was extremely entertaining, and played<br/>some new music he&apos;s working on, loosely in 72-tET. An as-yet-unfinished<br/>1-hour piece called &quot;Holy Land&quot; that starts with a soprano sax solo, then<br/>soprano sax duet, supposed to represent Abel and Caine in heaven. God is<br/>portrayed by a baritone sax (!)  He (Joe, not God) also played clarinet<br/>and alto sax for us - he has a lot of impressive microtonal stuff very<br/>well under his fingers, even at age 70-something.</p></div><h3><a id=23038 href="#23038">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2001 5:32:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/15/01 2:57 PM, &quot;jon wild&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wild@fas.harvard.edu">wild@fas.harvard.edu</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; He (Joe, not God) also played clarinet<br/>&gt; and alto sax for us - he has a lot of impressive microtonal stuff very<br/>&gt; well under his fingers, even at age 70-something.</p><p>Joe Maneri *is* God!!!!!!!</p><p>oneOfUs</p></div>
