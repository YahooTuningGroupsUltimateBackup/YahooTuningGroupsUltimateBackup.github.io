Pat Pagano might also be able<br/>to help if this does not work.  It should work perfectly:</p><p>In Scala:</p><p>1.  SET SYNTH 101<br/>2.  create or load your scale and optional keyboard map<br/>3.  SEND/FILE filename.mid  (it should show up in the scala directory)<br/>4.  Then use a sequencer to play the above file at a very slow tempo - like<br/>about 16 beats per measure. send the output through soundblaster midi out.<br/>You might be able to push the tempo higher if the &apos;Z will let you.  If not<br/>it will say BUFFER FULL or something like that.  Later versions of the mod<br/>could handle faster dump tempos.</p><p>Before you send the midi tuning dump set up the &apos;Z:</p><p>1. Hit utility bullon - I think you need to be in play single mode first<br/>2. Edit Micro tune?  Press &quot;Yes&quot;<br/>3. Hit right parameter button twice till it says Edit full keyboard? Press<br/>&quot;Yes&quot;<br/>4.  Then play your tuning dump as above.</p><p>If you did it properly, then you will see the display flash through every<br/>note name with corresponding tuning data.</p><p>You will need to remain in utility mode to have the microtuning on.  If you<br/>then press play/perform you will go into play single mode and you can then<br/>change the patch, but it will be in 12 TET.  To return to microtune press<br/>utility/yes/right parameter twice/Yes for Full keyboard and you will return<br/>to microtuned mode.</p><p>If you then turn off the module, its memory will retain the tuning.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, I&apos;ve checked to see that the TX81Z is set to &quot;write protect off&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t think this matters</p><p>&gt; and on midi receive channel 1.</p><p>You can also set it to OMNI mode.  which will receive on all channels.<br/>Somewhere in there I think there is a parameter for setting microtuning on<br/>other than what I described above (assuming that what I described does not<br/>work).  You might just try smashing button until/if it comes up.  Thats how<br/>I learned to use the &apos;Z.</p><p>Wait!!!<br/>I smashed a bit and and here it is:</p><p>1.  Press play/perform to get into performance mode (pF....)<br/>2.  Edit/Compare<br/>3.  Right Parameter till you get to MICTUN=Full.  If cursor is not on FULL<br/>(top line) then left master volume till it is.<br/>4.  Use DATA ENTRY buttons until it says MICTUN=FULL<br/>5.  Move cursor and set each channel to ON<br/>6.  Play/perform to get to play single then follow procedure to set single<br/>microtuning full keyboard on.</p><p>It seems from the above that perhaps you can be in performance mode and have<br/>full microtuning. I haven&apos;t tried it.  And you may not need to do the above<br/>to have microtuning on in single mode.</p><p>&gt; I am using a Soundblaster Awe 64 as my midi interface.  Perhaps that is<br/>the<br/>&gt; problem (??)</p><p>Definitely NOT the problem.  Don&apos;t get another soundcard unless you think<br/>the SB is really busted.</p><p>&gt; I should mention that I have to have a sequencer program &quot;up and running&quot;<br/>&gt; in order to hear sounds from my midi keyboard (midi out only) going THRU<br/>&gt; the Soundblaster (not playing it) to the TX81Z,</p><p>This makes sense.  You sequencer opens the MIDI OUT port.  Make sure that it<br/>is sending on channel 1 or whatever channel the &apos;Z is set for.  You are<br/>using a joystick port to MIDI cable correct?  The OUT cable connects to the<br/>MIDI IN on the &apos;Z.  Switch the cables if the above does not work.</p><p>&gt;so I was assuming that<br/>&gt; maybe all the different &quot;levels&quot; of hardware and software involved with<br/>&gt; this could create the impass...(??)</p><p>I doubt it.</p><p>&gt; Is there some way to try to set the Soundblaster to receive data from<br/>&gt; &quot;gsplay&quot; that I am not trying??  I&apos;m not certain how to set it at all,<br/>&gt; although probably I should print out a Soundblaster on-line manual...</p><p>There is nothing to do with the SB.  Scrap gsplay and use a regular<br/>sequencer where you can set the tempo manually more easily.</p><p>Good luck and let me know if it works.  The &apos;Z is a great little box for the<br/>money although I think the FM sounds are seriously not to great.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/>Gainesville FL</p></div>
