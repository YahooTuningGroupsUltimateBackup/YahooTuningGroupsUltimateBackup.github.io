So, I suppose one of Schlesinger&apos;s Harmoniai could be used, perhaps in pentatonic form accompanied by 2 or 3 tones in the bass (as from the slit drums), scrapers, rattles, etc. Aztec music may be a casualty of history like most of the rest of MesoAmerican culture and we may never know what it sounded like. Nahuatl is still widely spoken  in Mexico, though in numerous dialects, and it&apos;s possible that musical scales might have survived on folk instruments  as in Peru.</p><p>--john</p></div>
