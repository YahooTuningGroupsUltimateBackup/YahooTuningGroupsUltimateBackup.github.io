You didn&apos;t mention which you were<br/>doing. I suspect you listened to the I chord but not other chords. If you<br/>were purely playing melody, try again with 81/64 instead of 5/4 and see if<br/>you don&apos;t like that better.</p><p>Putting that aside, let&apos;s assume, with Rothenberg (or his supporters), that<br/>differences of a comma are not important in describing the melodic<br/>properties of a scale.</p><p>Then in your scale,</p><p>&gt;1/1 : 9/8 : 5/4 : 4/3 : 3/2 : 27/16 : 243/128 : 1/1<br/>&gt;   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /     \ /       \ /<br/>&gt;   8:9   9:10 15:16  8:9   8:9     8:9     256:243</p><p>the fact that every octave species has two identical tetrachords, if 5/4 is<br/>replaced with 81/64, makes this scale tetrachordal.</p><p>As I see it, the primary opponent of tetrachordality in scale theory is<br/>maximal evenness. It is very fashionable among academic music theorists<br/>right now to view the major scale as a maximally even set of 7 in a 12-tone<br/>universe. But in investigating the decatonic scales, there were two distinct<br/>scale forms that presented themselves, and it so happened that one was<br/>maximally even, while the other was tetrachordal (pentachordal, actually).<br/>In 22-tET, the maximally even scale is (any mode of)</p><p>0 2 4 7 9 11 13 15 18 20 (22)</p><p>while the pentachordal scale is (any mode of)</p><p>0 2 4 7 9 11 13 16 18 20 (22).</p><p>The former scale has 8 consonant tetrads, while the latter has 6. Both have<br/>the same number of 709-cent &quot;perfect fifths&quot;. But playing around melodically<br/>with both scales, using many modes of each, the latter sounds more pleasing,<br/>comprehensible, and musical. So I think I can conclude that tetrachordality<br/>is more important than maximal evenness for melodic considerations of scale<br/>structure.</p></div><h3><a id=2623 href="#2623">ðŸ”—</a>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>4/29/1999 6:50:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Kraig Grady, TD 158.6]<br/>&gt; In Greek musical writingsII Andrew Barker (Cambridge) has charts<br/>&gt; of mixed tetrachords and quote Ptolemy as saying<br/>&gt; &quot;In every case of a mixture, the &quot;softer&quot; tetrachord (that with<br/>&gt; the greater highest interval) falls below the disjunctive tone,<br/>&gt; the &quot;tenser&quot; above it.<br/>&gt; Page 358</p><p>Interesting... exactly what I found myself in my own<br/>listening tests.</p><p>[Paul Erlich, TD 158.10]<br/>&gt; If you were purely playing melody, try again with 81/64 instead<br/>&gt; of 5/4 and see if you don&apos;t like that better.</p><p>Sure, I like the scale with 81/64 (all Pythagorean tetrachords),<br/>but I was coming at it from the other direction:  I listened<br/>first to the 5-limit JI scale.
