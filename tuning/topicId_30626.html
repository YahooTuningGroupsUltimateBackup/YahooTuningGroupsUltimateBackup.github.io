I don&apos;t apologize about that for there is nothing personal in that. I keep respect for these persons and their works. I express only the opinion it misses a foundation.</p><p>I work on my next post starting with serialism and asking how sonic matter is abilitated to hold musical sense ? Since sense is not hold by sensitive qualities but differences in quality, I study the structure of the differences field for each sonic parameter, the natural expressive strategies of musical creation and interpretation, the privilegied function of the pitch height interval, etc. in view to answer a simple question about the chord theorem (the object of a precedent message).</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=30633 href="#30633">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2001 12:03:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Pierre Lamothe&quot; &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t understand, for instance, why numbers having absolutely no<br/>&gt; sense for the human perception are so currently in use on the List.</p><p>Funny, that&apos;s how I feel about your work, Pierre!

Gene is a fine<br/>mathematician, and perhaps with his help, we can come to a better<br/>understanding of your theories. I welcome generalized abstraction<br/>over particular numbers anytime -- I hope my post to Jon Szanto,<br/>which he printed out a few months ago, makes this clear. But Pierre,<br/>to convince me of the worth of your theories, you will have to go<br/>beyond a mere mathematical edifice and ground your axioms in musical,<br/>perceptual considerations. For I am a musician most of all and even<br/>the fanciest mathematical constructions will have little interest for<br/>me if they are not motivated by the types of questions I would ask as<br/>a musician.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since I posted there a message (Gammes et principes Hellegouarch)<br/>showing the convergence between Wilson CS, Hellegouarch quotient-<br/>group, Fokker periodicity block and congruity condition of gammier, I<br/>give the reference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ircam.fr/listes/archives/mamuphi/msg00255.html">http://www.ircam.fr/listes/archives/mamuphi/msg00255.html</a></p><p>I will try to look at this and I hope Gene will too.</p></div><h3><a id=30638 href="#30638">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/24/2001 12:54:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Pierre Lamothe&quot; &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand, for instance, why numbers having absolutely<br/>no<br/>&gt; &gt; sense for the human perception are so currently in use on the<br/>List.</p><p>&gt; Funny, that&apos;s how I feel about your work, Pierre!
