I had previously dismissed as being basically the same thing<br/>as 12-tet (in which the fifths are almost just), but with the octave<br/>stretched a bit. It would be interesting though to see if there are<br/>any properties of this scale that have been overlooked, or to run some<br/>A/B comparisons to hear the difference musically between the two.</p><p>-MikeI agree Mike. As I told you, this idea and complementary details were defined in a short period of time.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Mike,Now that my &quot;discovery&quot; and calculations were done for nothing what about hiring a fellow to make a list ofscale discoveries since the XVII century? This way I don&acute;t start investigating already patented subjects. Marpurg was the first with Piagui II, though I doubt that he got Piagui II because he never calculated the Piagui P and K semitone factors that are the exclusive doors to enter to the Piagui system. Now Cordierin France put me out of the &quot;crowded&quot; perfect fifths scene. With these experiencies there is no future for the inventors. Right?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In my preceding message related to the perfect fifths tuning I included the twelve relative frequencies with respect to C = 1. One error was found in F#:<br/>F# = 1,41558300612. The red number 0 must be replaced by 8.</p><p>-- The 88 tone frequencies given for the piano (Hz) seem to be correct. This set obviously does not consider the needed adjustments for cancelling the ear imperfection.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>Lima, September 20, 2008</p></div>
