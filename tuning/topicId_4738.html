My best<br/>recollection was that is was Groven, but after years of hearing Groven<br/>referred to as a 36-tone JI composer, I tried to flush that from my memory.<br/>So now it turns out that Groven used 1/8-schisma temperament. Well, a<br/>1/8-schisma tempered fifth is 701.711 cents, while 100/171 octave is 701.754<br/>cents. Close enough, but the questions remain: Did New Grove actually say<br/>that? If so, did they get it from something Groven actually said or wrote,<br/>or did someone else note this approximation? 118-tone equal temperament<br/>comes closer, with a fifth of 701.695 cents, so where did 171-tET come from<br/>(if not my own confusion)?</p><p>To tuning listers: this is of interest partially to fill out Joe Monzo&apos;s ET<br/>table, and partially because 171 (along with 22) just came up as the most<br/>common periodicity block size using Fokker&apos;s unison vectors of 225:224 or<br/>smaller. Also, 171-tET has a maximum error of 0.40 cents in the 9-limit,<br/>making it the lowest ET to improve on 99-tET&apos;s figure of 2.15 cents. In fact<br/>171 is best for its size for the 7-limit and even the 5-limit (just barely<br/>beating 118), but not the 3-limit, where 53 is better. Wildly speculating<br/>(given his interest in the seljefl&#xFFFD;yte): maybe Groven chose 171 over 118<br/>because 171 is consistent through the 13-limit while 118 is consistent only<br/>though the 11-limit?</p></div><h3><a id=4750 href="#4750">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/1999 8:00:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 309.10]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wildly speculating (given his interest in the seljefl&#xFFFD;yte):<br/>&gt; maybe Groven chose 171 over 118 because 171 is consistent<br/>&gt; through the 13-limit while 118 is consistent only though<br/>&gt; the 11-limit?</p><p>Bravo, Paul!

I wouldn&apos;t be inclined to trust it for accuracy in such heavy math in any case, but might refer to a regional library&apos;s copy if I needed to, which I have done in the past, to resolve the difference between Guiseppe and Umberto Giordano, for instance.  I don&apos;t recall anyone else referring to a scale, theoretical or otherwise, with that many tones per octave.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Paul H.
