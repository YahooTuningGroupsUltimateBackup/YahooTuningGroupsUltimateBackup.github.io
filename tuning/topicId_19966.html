We&apos;re both right.</p><p>[BEGIN EXCERPT]<br/>In order to be patentable, an invention must pass four<br/>tests:</p><p>1. The invention must fall into one of the five<br/>   &quot;statutory classes&quot; of things that are patentable:</p><p>1. processes,</p><p>2. machines,</p><p>3. manufactures (that is, objects made by humans<br/>   or machines),</p><p>4. compositions of matter, and</p><p>5. new uses of any of the above.</p><p>2. The invention must be &quot;useful&quot;. One aspect of the<br/>   &quot;utility&quot; test is that the invention cannot be a mere<br/>   theoretical phenomenon.</p><p>3. The invention must be &quot;novel&quot;, that is, it must be<br/>   something that no one did before.</p><p>4. The invention must be &quot;unobvious&quot; to &quot;a person having<br/>   ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter<br/>   pertains&quot;. This requirement is the one on which many<br/>   patentability disputes hinge.</p><p>[END EXCERPT]<br/>(Source: html://www.patents.com/patents.htm)</p><p>Anyway, a piano tuning would be statuatory class #1,<br/>&quot;processes&quot;. Thus it has been possible in the past to<br/>patent procedures for tuning a piano (and in the past, the<br/>procedure is pretty much what defined the tuning).</p><p>And if your new method of tuning relies on a claim of part<br/>of a method of some other patented tuning, you could find<br/>yourself having to license use of that claim or come up<br/>with a different method.</p><p>Yes, the extremely difficult, clever, and completely<br/>non-obvious *method* for tuning a piano to 12tET was<br/>*completely* patentable. But it&apos;s been around long enough<br/>that it is no longer novel.</p><p>Fortunately for all of us, tunings in the form of a<br/>description of ratios or as cents values are not<br/>patentable, though a *procedure* for achieving them on a<br/>given instrument is.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that anyone bothered to patent the method<br/>of tuning instruments by MIDI sysex messages, so we should<br/>be safe there since that is no longer novel.</p><p>Also, I and others have been retuning instruments through<br/>MIDI pitch bends for many years (myself since 1987). This<br/>method is *definately* 100% patentable but thank God it is<br/>no longer novel otherwise we&apos;d have one heck of a dog<br/>fight on our hands!</p><p>Also things like the MOS method of coming up with ratio<br/>sets and the idea of extracting tunings from spectra using<br/>FFT are probably all patentable.</p><p>Oh, and by the way the WTO treaty extended patents<br/>from 17 to 20 years.</p><p>And as advice to all of us, you MUST keep a lab book<br/>made out of physical paper where you write down your<br/>inventions and initial and date every one of them. This<br/>will be your best way to defend yourself in the event that<br/>a big corporation tries to steal your invention by<br/>patenting it themselves. (From personal experience, I can<br/>testify that this is what companies do -- steal things<br/>from hapless inventors who just want to make the world a<br/>better place.)</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
