Information 212-925-8270</p><p>Dream House: Seven+Eight Years of Sound and Light,<br/>a collaborative Sound and Light Environment by<br/>composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela,<br/>is presented in an extended exhibition at MELA Foundation,<br/>275 Church Street, 3rd Floor.  The environment is open<br/>Thursdays and Saturdays from 2:00 PM to Midnight.<br/>Suggested contribution is $4.00.  The long-term exhibition<br/>opened in Fall 1993 and will continue for this season through June 21, 2003.</p><p>Young and Zazeela characterize the Sound and Light<br/>Environment as &quot;a time installation measured by a<br/>setting of continuous frequencies in sound and light.&quot;<br/>In the light environment Marian Zazeela presents<br/>four works, two environmental:  Imagic Light and<br/>Magenta Day, Magenta Night, in installations specifically<br/>designed for the site; and two sculptural:  a neon work,<br/>Dream House Variation I, and a wall sculpture,<br/>Ruine Window 1992 from her series, Still Light.<br/>In the environment Imagic Light, Zazeela projects<br/>pairs of colored lights on mobile forms to create<br/>seemingly three-dimensional colored shadows in a<br/>luminous field.</p><p>In the concurrent sound environment, La Monte Young<br/>presents The Base 9:7:4 Symmetry in Prime Time When<br/>Centered above and below The Lowest Term Primes<br/>in The Range 288 to 224 with The Addition of 279<br/>and 261 in Which The Half of The Symmetric Division<br/>Mapped above and Including 288 Consists of The<br/>Powers of 2 Multiplied by The Primes within The<br/>Ranges of 144 to 128, 72 to 64 and 36 to 32 Which<br/>Are Symmetrical to Those Primes in Lowest Terms<br/>in The Half of The Symmetric Division Mapped below<br/>and Including 224 within The Ranges 126 to 112,<br/>63 to 56 and 31.5 to 28 with The Addition of 119,<br/>a periodic composite sound waveform environment<br/>created from sine wave components generated digitally<br/>in real time on a custom-designed Rayna interval synthesizer.</p><p>Both artists are presenting works utilizing concepts<br/>of structural symmetry.  Zazeela&apos;s mobile forms are<br/>arrayed in symmetrical patterns with lights placed in<br/>precisely symmetrical positions creating symmetrical<br/>colored shadows; the wall-mounted light sculpture<br/>and the neon are both symmetrical forms.   Young&apos;s<br/>sound environment is composed of frequencies tuned<br/>to the harmonic series between 288 and 224, utilizing<br/>numbers with factors of only 9, or those primes or<br/>octave transpositions of smaller primes that fall within<br/>this range.  The interval 288/256 reduces to a 9/8 interval<br/>as does the interval 252/224.  Thirty-two frequencies<br/>satisfy the above definition, of which seventeen fall within<br/>the range of the upper, and fourteen fall within the range<br/>of the lower of these two symmetrical 9/8 intervals.<br/>Young has arranged these thirty-one frequencies in a<br/>unique constellation, symmetrical above and below<br/>the thirty-second frequency, the center harmonic 254<br/>(the prime 127 x 2).</p><p>Young has stated that:  &quot;This is my newest and most<br/>radical work; the Rayna synthesizer has made it possible<br/>to realize intervals which are derived from such high<br/>primes that, not only is it unlikely that anyone has ever<br/>worked with these intervals before, it is also highly<br/>unlikely that anyone has ever heard them or perhaps<br/>even imagined the feelings they create.&quot;</p><p>In 1966, Young and Zazeela pioneered the concept<br/>of the continuous sound and light environment, and<br/>have since presented large-scale sound and light<br/>productions in museums and galleries worldwide for<br/>continuous periods from one week to five years,<br/>including installations in the Metropolitan Museum,<br/>New York; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; documenta 5,<br/>Kassel; Kunstverein, Cologne.  Under a long-term<br/>commission from the Dia Art Foundation (1979-85),<br/>Zazeela and Young collaborated in a six-year continuous<br/>Dream House presentation set in a six-story building<br/>on Harrison Street in New York City, featuring multiple<br/>interrelated sound and light environments, exhibitions,<br/>performances, research and listening facilities, and archives.<br/>Now in its tenth year, MELA Foundation&apos;s Dream House:<br/>Seven+Eight Years of Sound and Light, is Young and Zazeela&apos;s longest<br/>installation to date.</p><p>In Minimalism:Origins (Indiana University Press, 1993),<br/>Edward Strickland has written of their collaborative<br/>environments:  &quot;Intense light [is] aimed through [colored]<br/>filters at quasicalligraphic aluminum shapes hung by<br/>ultrafine filaments.  The effect is a unique and extraordinary<br/>transvaluation of perception: the mobiles seem to hover<br/>unanchored, while the shadows they cast in various hues<br/>attain an apparent solidity against the light-dissolved<br/>walls equal to their literally palpable but apparently<br/>disembodied sources.  Like Young&apos;s music, to which it<br/>serves as an almost uncanny complement, Zazeela&apos;s work<br/>is predicated upon the extended duration necessary<br/>to experience the nuances which are its essence.&quot;</p><p>Their one-year sound and light environment collaboration,<br/>The Romantic Symmetry (over a 60 cycle base) in Prime<br/>Time from 112 to 144 with 119 / Time Light Symmetry<br/>(Dia Art Foundation, 22nd Street, NYC 1989), was<br/>described by Village Voice critic Kyle Gann as &quot;some<br/>of the strangest and most forward-looking art New York<br/>has to offer.&quot;   A 1990 Donguy Gallery, Paris, exhibition<br/>was purchased by the French Cultural Ministry National<br/>Foundation of Contemporary Art for permanent installation<br/>in a French museum.  Die Tageszeitung wrote about<br/>their 1992 DAAD Ruine der K&iuml;&iquest;&half;nste, Berlin environment:<br/>&quot;A longer stay in the Dream House is necessary to<br/>experience the full effect.  The mind is calmed by the<br/>environment in a meditative way, and subtle sound and<br/>light effects that are veiled at first sight then come to the<br/>fore.&quot;</p><p>Of the current environment, Seven+Eight Years of Sound<br/>and Light, Sandy McCroskey has written in 1/1 that<br/>&quot;Zazeela&apos;s light sculptures have invariably, teasingly<br/>refused to surrender their entire secret to photographic<br/>reproduction, so much do they depend on the retinal<br/>impact of activated photons in real time and so much<br/>do they exploit, in ways analogous to Young&apos;s techniques,<br/>the creation of visual combination tones and an accumulation of<br/>after-images.&quot;</p></div>
