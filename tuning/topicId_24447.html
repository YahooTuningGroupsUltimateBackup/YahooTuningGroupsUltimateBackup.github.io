So long as it<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t have to work as meantone as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. Not meantone as well. It&apos;s interesting to consider a keyboard tuning<br/>&gt; that would be a kind of 31 tone well temperament; miracle in one region,<br/>&gt; varying smoothly to meantone in another.</p><p>I thought about that last night.  Perhaps I don&apos;t need to read the List<br/>any more, and ideas will be communicated to me telepathically!</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m trying to find some good ones by ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But some will be unavailable to you _because_ of your intial choice of<br/>&gt; open<br/>&gt; string tuning.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s that chicken and egg problem again.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Guitars being guitars, this<br/>&gt; &gt; often means some added notes creep in to the 11-limit chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please explain. You mean because they have 6 strings and you only have 4<br/>&gt; fingers. This of course is the design challenge.</p><p>I could always not strum all the strings, but I find it&apos;s better to leave<br/>the &quot;bad&quot; notes in there.  It&apos;s idiomatic for guitar chords anyway.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  But different things are likely to sound good with a more accurate<br/>&gt; fretting,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed.</p><p>I&apos;ve also had to throw away chords after finding the guitar was way out of<br/>tune.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Another aim is to keep the strings roughly evenly spread in pitch.<br/>&gt; &gt; No pairs in my tuning should be closer than a neutral third, or<br/>&gt; &gt; further &gt;<br/>&gt; apart than a tritone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you mean no further apart than a diminished fifth (approx 7:10) 633<br/>&gt; cents?</p><p>Ideally no further apart than the 7:5, but that&apos;s hard to pull off and I<br/>see a 7:10 sneaked in there.  It&apos;s also be convenient if the interval<br/>that&apos;s usually G-B doesn&apos;t get much bigger, but you get used to that<br/>fairly easily.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I thought of putting it around the major third from the nut.  Exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; where depends on whether you prefer 5:4 to 9:7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please explain.</p><p>It&apos;s partly to match my meantone fretting, as explained in my reply to<br/>Paul.  Oh, and I suppose they should be / instead of :.  But with the 5/4,<br/>it&apos;d be like this:</p><p>r   q   r   q   r   q   q   r   q   r   q   r<br/>                 6/5     5/4     4/3         3/2</p><p>r   q   r   q   r   q   r   q   q   r   q   r<br/>                 6/5     9/7     4/3         3/2</p><p>Either way, you start off with a simple pattern that takes you to a<br/>neutral third, and you have a 4/3.  It wouldn&apos;t seem right to me for a<br/>guitar not to have a perfect fourth from the nut.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How would you define this optimum rotation?  Surely it&apos;d depend on<br/>&gt; &gt; how you wanted the &quot;home key&quot; to relate to the open strings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but I figure the scale on the top string must be considered as the<br/>&gt; home key (whatever the rotation), because you can&apos;t choose to play these<br/>&gt; notes on another string. All other strings only need to give you the<br/>&gt; home<br/>&gt; key as far down the neck as the pitch of the next string (but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; better<br/>&gt; if they go further).</p><p>Ah, right.</p><p>&gt; I think we only need to consider the string with the minimum value, r-3.<br/>&gt; The fretting should be such that the point of symmetry on the reference<br/>&gt; string is the same pitch class as this open string. i.e. POS is (72 -<br/>&gt; 3*7)/72 oct = 51/72 oct = 750 cents from the nut.</p><p>I don&apos;t think this is correct.  You need to consider the strings with the<br/>maximum and minimum values, and make sure they can see each other.</p><p>&gt; If the POS is note 4 (decimal) the 21 notes available on the strings<br/>&gt; would<br/>&gt; be: (Missing home-key notes are shown with &quot;*&quot;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; r+2 r+5 r-1 r+2 r-3 r</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; When I set it out like this I see it&apos;s tougher than I thought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice that we have a &quot;hole&quot; between the 2nd and 3rd strings where we<br/>&gt; can&apos;t<br/>&gt; play 4&gt; or 5&gt; at all.</p><p>Looks like your POS is a lot further down than mine.  But it should be<br/>possible to place that symmetrically about the tritone.  The closer it<br/>gets to the tritone, the more tunings should work by your criterion.<br/>It&apos;ll be something to do with the number of generators covered by the open<br/>strings, and the number you can move in either direction from the nut.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
