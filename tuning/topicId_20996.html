The funny part is<br/>that the MM had such a characteristic sound (and not only hadn&apos;t<br/>broken much but was easy to replace the light bulbs) that while it<br/>only ended up in two works (&quot;And on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in<br/>Petaluma&quot; and &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot;), it&apos;s sound was not only<br/>recognizable but a favorite of many first time Partch listeners.<br/>Going back in time to those old enough to remember, it reminded them<br/>of the old Maxwell House perc (as in percolator) coffee commercial.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
