This notation<br/>&gt;is basically pythagorean, extending indefinitely by fifths in either<br/>&gt;direction through the addition of sharps and flats. When mapped onto<br/>&gt;meantone, which has one size of fifths, this indefinite extension is<br/>&gt;preserved but the relationship of sharps to flats flips over (i.e. in<br/>&gt;meantone db is higher in pitch than c#). When mapped onto 12tet, so-called<br/>&gt;enharmonic equivalence is introduced and the chain of fifths becomes a<br/>&gt;closed cycle of 12 members.</p><p>However, as a tuning &quot;newbie&quot;  (I &apos;fess up...&quot;) I need a little bit more<br/>elaboration and clarification of this whole &quot;enharmonic&quot; problem.  I know<br/>this has to be &quot;easy old hat&quot; stuff to you guys...  Enharmonics are<br/>obviously equivalent in 12-tET, but please describe in more detail what<br/>they were before...  If this is too dumb for the list, please post me off-<br/>list.  However, I doubt that it is, since I happen to know there are<br/>probably 100-200 &quot;lurkers&quot; out there on the list who aren&apos;t posting<br/>probably simply because they don&apos;t really know the answers to such<br/>questions either....</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2000 11:31:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think that Joe Monzo has written about this extensively, but I give a<br/>quick response:</p><p>I prefer to save &quot;enharmonic&quot; for the classical Greek tetrachordal genus<br/>with a major third and a semitone (&quot;pyknon&quot;) divided into two pitches,<br/>broadly approximable by quartertones (see Chalmers, _Divisions of the<br/>Tetrachord_).</p><p>Because the interval between, say c# and db, in either pythagorean, just or<br/>meantone, was of microtonal magnitude, it was considered an &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>interval. With the application of a tempered mapping where c# was equal in<br/>frequency to db, the two pitches became &quot;enharmonically equivalent.&quot;</p><p>For beginners: please note that none of this has anything to do with<br/>&quot;inharmonic&quot;.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>Paul H.
