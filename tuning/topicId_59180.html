And in the future, if there is a future, please try to remember<br/>that I am a trained historian who reads original sources, and who<br/>has a passion for footnotes.  Without historical context and<br/>meaning, all numbers are meaningless.</p><p>Here is Mr. Yarman&apos;s diatribe before he disappeared to wherever:</p><p>&gt;Hah! Hark at the one who presumes he has monopoly over<br/>&gt;interpreting Maqam Music theory. Hark at those who assume<br/>&gt;that JI intervals used by Maqam Music can be correctly<br/>&gt;represented both in pitch and notation by a pure cycle of fifths.<br/>&gt;Even a simple scrutiny of the link to a taksim recording on the<br/>&gt;bottom of that &gt;same page would confirm the usage of intervals<br/>&gt;around 12/11 and 13/12. Of course some people do not concern<br/>&gt;themselves at all whether the frets give these interval or not.</p><p>Here is my COMPLETE non-edited response:</p><p>&gt;From my manuscript Musical Mathematics: A Practice in the<br/>&gt;Mathematics of Tuning Instruments and Analyzing Scales<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;A numerical analysis reveals that Al-Farabi&apos;s length ratios<br/>&gt;include six prime factors: 2, 3, 7, 11, 17, 149, and Ibn Sina&apos;s,<br/>&gt;only four prime factors: 2, 3, 7, 13.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Obviously, the moveable frets on uds and tunburs do not exclude<br/>&gt;any prime factors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For that reason, equally obvious is the fact that within a given<br/>&gt;civilization, theorists and theories may differ and coexist, but not<br/>&gt;at the expense of myopic and historical denial.</p><p>I chose to respond with a prime factor analysis because Mr.<br/>Yarman thinks that because he heard &quot;intervals around 12/11 and<br/>13/12,&quot; he therefore has license to dismiss &quot;pure cycle of fifths&quot; as<br/>a basic tuning theory of the modern Turkish tunbur.

Could<br/>you<br/>&gt; not simply use the 53-et that some Turkish theorists use?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the above-mentioned PDF file, I use a &quot;down arrow&quot; with<br/>an &quot;S&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; on top to indicate a 5-limit ratio reduced by a schisma comma,<br/>&gt; &gt; which, equivalently, represents the exact ratio in the<br/>descending<br/>&gt; &gt; spiral of fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might find Keenan and Secor&apos;s sagittal notation interesting. I<br/>&gt; think anyway there is no point in introducing yet another special<br/>&gt; symbol for the schisma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the above-mentioned PDF file, I also use the koron sign,<br/>which I<br/>&gt; &gt; describe on the following page --<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/Al-Farabi's_'Uds.htm">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/Al-Farabi's_'Uds.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are a lot of Al-Farabi scales in the Scala archives, but I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t find the 9 and 22 note scales on this page there. I give<br/>them<br/>&gt; below, and suggest they be added.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing to note about these scales is that 159-et does an<br/>excellent<br/>&gt; job of representing them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! farabi9.scl<br/>&gt; Al-Farabi 9 note ud scale<br/>&gt; 9<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 9/8<br/>&gt; 27/22<br/>&gt; 81/64<br/>&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt; 18/11<br/>&gt; 27/16<br/>&gt; 16/9<br/>&gt; 2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! farabi22ud.scl<br/>&gt; Al-Farabi 22 note ud scale<br/>&gt; 22<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 256/243<br/>&gt; 18/17<br/>&gt; 12/11<br/>&gt; 9/8<br/>&gt; 32/27<br/>&gt; 27/22<br/>&gt; 8192/6561<br/>&gt; 81/64<br/>&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt; 1024/729<br/>&gt; 24/17<br/>&gt; 16/11<br/>&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt; 128/81<br/>&gt; 18/11<br/>&gt; 32768/19683<br/>&gt; 27/16<br/>&gt; 16/9<br/>&gt; 4096/2187<br/>&gt; 32/17<br/>&gt; 64/33<br/>&gt; 2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 159 equal, these scales are<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0, 27, 47, 54, 66, 93, 113, 120, 132<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0, 12, 13, 20, 27, 39, 47, 51, 54, 66, 78, 79, 86, 93, 105, 113,<br/>&gt; 117, 120, 132, 144, 145, 152<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In terms of the 2deg159 MOS, they are<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -66, -56, -33, -23, 0, 27, 33, 60, 66<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -73, -66, -60, -56, -54, -40, -33, -27, -23, -21, -7, 0, 6, 10, 27,<br/>&gt; 33, 39, 43, 60, 66, 72, 76<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, 159-et represents them very well, but the 79 note<br/>&gt; 2deg159 MOS is useless. Other temperaments do better--for instance<br/>&gt; &quot;guiron&quot;, the 118&amp;159 temperament, which is 31deg159.</p></div>
