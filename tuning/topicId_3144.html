A magical tone from &quot;nowhere&quot;.</p><p>No. Nice try though.</p><p>First, a doubling of amplitude is not &quot;twice as loud&quot; but only 6dB louder,<br/>and second, in white noise the amount of energy at precisely 50Hz is<br/>infinitesimal. Also, my understanding is that you can use band-limited<br/>noise which need not contain any 50Hz. Sorry I didn&apos;t make that clear. It<br/>is presumably due to the same neural processing that gives rise to the<br/>virtual fundamental effect. It&apos;s just somewhat more surprising in this<br/>context. The processing looks an awful lot like auto-correlation.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if the effect occurs when the original and delayed are<br/>presented to opposite ears, or when combined for any or both ears, or under<br/>both these conditions. You there Paul E.? Bill S.?</p><p>I would guess it is only experienced when the signals are combined<br/>pre-brain. In which case I think the spectrum (on a log scale, i.e.<br/>loudness scale) looks like a comb, or a row of arches side-by-side, with<br/>notches going to minus infinity at the odd multiples of 25Hz and broadly<br/>rounded 6dB humps in between. Frequencies either side of multiples of 50Hz<br/>will be reinforced nearly as much as the 50Hz multiple. So the spectrum<br/>alone, gives no reason to expect a perceptual component the same as that<br/>produced by a 50Hz tone. For example it would obviously be meaningless to<br/>ask what the phase of this virtual 50Hz tone was at any point in time.</p><p>Instead, I expect that this common component in the perception of (a) real<br/>50Hz, (b) chords with a virtual 50Hz fundamental, and (c) 20ms delayed<br/>summed noise, are all better viewed in the time domain as the perception of<br/>a signal that is most self-similar after a 20ms delay (hence<br/>auto-correlation). I understand this is referred to as &quot;periodicity&quot;.</p><p>Hey thanks Paul E. and Bill S. for teaching me this stuff, so I can now<br/>happily regurgitate it. :-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>J.

I meant twice the amplitude.<br/>And I think it would actually be 3dB since it is a single pole filter.<br/>2x amplitude = +6dB amplitude = +3dB power. (perceived &quot;loudness&quot; curves<br/>are related to power intensity though not the same).</p><p>&gt; and second, in white noise the amount of energy at precisely 50Hz is<br/>&gt; infinitesimal.</p><p>I disagree - if you really believe that the amount of energy present<br/>for any given frequency is infintesimal, then the spectrum wold be flat<br/>with a peak at -infinity dB. There is significant energy at 50Hz in<br/>white noise. If you don&apos;t believe me look at any white noise signal you<br/>like in any spectrum analyzer you like. The summation of an infinite number<br/>of frequencies at finite amplitude does not result in a signal of infinite<br/>amplitude.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if the effect occurs when the original and delayed are<br/>&gt; presented to opposite ears, or when combined for any or both ears, or under<br/>&gt; both these conditions.</p><p>With headphones? You wouldn&apos;t hear it. With speakers - yes.</p><p>Hey everybody, a delay line combined with the original<br/>is just a digital filter! That&apos;s why this works.</p><p>Dave, I believe you&apos;re right about the multiples of 50Hz<br/>thing which I stupidly failed to mention - it&apos;s really a<br/>comb filter. Whoosh!

So speaking of some frequencies being reinforced and others not is not quite correct. And yet one hears a 50Hz tone (especially if some feedback is used in the delay). It is not because of any kind of resonance, though it sure sounds like one. The reason is that periodicity does play a role in pitch perception, and the repetition of similar features every 20 ms will &quot;fool&quot; the ear into hearing a 50Hz tone, even though there isn&apos;t an amplitude peak at that frequency.</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xxx</h3><span>5/21/1999 4:44:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The result of applying the delay to the white noise has a graph of<br/>amplitude vs. frequency exactly like the one &gt; above.
