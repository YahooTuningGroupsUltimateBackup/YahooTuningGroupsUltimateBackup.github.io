Abraham (may Allah bless him) was a tribal patriarch!</p><p>Moreover, I&apos;ve never been fond of the Alla Turca toilet, which is hardly anything but a hole in the ground. Clearly, our understanding of evil is at variance.</p><p>Though this post of mine has nothing to do with tuning for this once, I must say that I sneer at science which claims to justify the non-existance of any world other than material.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Carl Lumma<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 04 Ekim 2005 Sal&imath; 4:07<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Confucius</p><p>  SNIP!</p><p>  Meanwhile, it may be surprising that I&apos;m a tribalist of sorts,<br/>  who believes odd things like that toilets and routine infant<br/>  circumcision are the greatest evils in the world and<br/>  that we should all be living in dome communities in<br/>  the forest.</p><p>  SNIP!</p><p>  I&apos;ve been quite fond of the Goethe I&apos;ve read, though<br/>  none of it mentioned science.  I disagree with most<br/>  critiques of science I&apos;ve seen, by Nietzsche and others.<br/>  As for the &quot;determininist scientists&quot;, how many do you<br/>  know?  I count among my closest friends and both of my<br/>  parents at least a dozen professional scientests (and<br/>  many more I&apos;ve partied with).  They&apos;re all more religious<br/>  than I am.</p><p>  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=61055 href="#61055">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 11:31:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Though this post of mine has nothing to do with tuning for<br/>&gt; this once, I must say that I sneer at science which claims to<br/>&gt; justify the non-existance of any world other than material.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a theory that claims its non-existence.

But in response to you reply Carl, that<br/>is a noble and open attitude. However much of science is not so<br/>open, so, even if they are confronted with piles and piles of<br/>scientific evidence for various phenomena as psychic abilities,<br/>telepathy, ghosts and so on (as they are), as they have no theory to<br/>explain it they simply deny its existance. So generally if a<br/>scientist does research in these areas they are branded an outcast.<br/>Not very scientific, but unfortunately it seems to be true (the<br/>fanatisism that is).<br/>Still, I think healthy sceptisism can be good.<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.</p></div><h3><a id=61082 href="#61082">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 1:03:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Then may I humbly suggest that you investigate Islam upon your earliest convenience?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Carl Lumma<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 04 Ekim 2005 Sal&imath; 21:31<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Infant circumcision and attuning to toilet seats</p><p>  &gt; Though this post of mine has nothing to do with tuning for<br/>  &gt; this once, I must say that I sneer at science which claims to<br/>  &gt; justify the non-existance of any world other than material.</p><p>  I don&apos;t have a theory that claims its non-existence.
