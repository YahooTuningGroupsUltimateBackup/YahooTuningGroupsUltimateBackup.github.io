(I get my tuning list in digest format, so<br/>others may have already pointed this out.)  Xenakis&apos; sieve theory (those<br/>new to this: it starts in the chapter &quot;Towards a Metamusic&quot;) actually DOES<br/>include plenty of provision for ratio-derived scale elements by examining<br/>what happens when the &quot;elementary displacements&quot; are variously examined as<br/>tempered semitones, Aristoxenean segments (1/12-tones), commas of Didymos<br/>(81/80), etc. etc.  Sieve theory does not require either equal or<br/>non-equal temperaments, but straddles or generalizes in such a way that<br/>both are, or can be, included.  Also, none of Xenakis&apos; sieve theory<br/>*requires* octave equivalence, as he notes, but he certainly favors it in<br/>this particular treatment.  He uses sieve theory to get at some extremely<br/>complex scale structures, both historical and synthetic.</p><p>Steve</p></div>
