Nevertheless, I think bass is<br/>the least derivative part.  I can sing all four parts of (most)<br/>barbershop arrangements.  When I made 4-track recordings of<br/>myself, I tried putting the lead first and the bass first.<br/>Bass first seemed to produce the best results.</p><p>I certainly listen as much to the bass as I do the lead when<br/>singing tenor.  Of course this depends on the passage.  If<br/>there are parallel 3rds or something with the lead, then<br/>I&apos;ll tune to that.</p><p>Probably baritone is the most derivative part intonation-<br/>wise, listening more to the bass and lead than the tenor.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=65162 href="#65162">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2006 5:26:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 07 Mar 2006, Aaron Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; The lead is the second voice in the mix, right?

That&apos;s much clearer now.  As a lad, I used<br/>to sing alto to bolster the numbers in my Mum&apos;s (SATB)<br/>choir, which always had plenty of sopranos and basses, and<br/>usually enough tenors to get by, but lacked altos.  It struck<br/>me then how few pieces were written with a view to giving<br/>the alto a singable part - we were _always_ plugging the<br/>gaps in the harmony.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.375 / Virus Database: 268.2.0/275 - Release Date: 6/3/06</p></div><h3><a id=65165 href="#65165">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2006 6:26:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The standard stance in quartet formation<br/>&gt; is bari, bass, lead, tenor.
