This has to be answered in two important regards:</p><p>The first is that all of the great cultures of Asia have long possessed<br/>their own technical means to implement such temperaments, without the<br/>influence of western tonal hegemony. Indeed, it is we in the West who owe<br/>the Islamicate world for critical elements of tonal and mathematical<br/>understanding.</p><p>The second point is simply that the major exporters, whether direct or<br/>through corporate holdings, of tempered music, instruments and technology<br/>to the world are East Asian, of which Japan has the largest share. The<br/>major exporter of non-tempered music is the Indian film industry, a major<br/>force in world popular culture, but one virtually unknown in western<br/>countries. In a real sense, a competition between ETs and non-ETs is being<br/>played out on the world stage by India and East Asia. (At the moment, the<br/>score is 2:1 for 12tet Hong Kong martial arts films over Indian musicals.)<br/>Europeans and Americans, although providing raw musical products to the<br/>12tet side, are basically watching it all from the substitute&apos;s bench.</p></div><h3><a id=1644 href="#1644">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/1999 8:41:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just go to Damascus, Beirut or Cairo and buy a tambour.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While Turkish frettings have remained stubbornly non-24tet (despite the<br/>&gt; introduction of off-the-boat synthesizers and bass guitars to the Arabesque<br/>&gt; ensemble) with 14 to 53 frets in various pythagorean schemes, the<br/>&gt; long-necked lutes in much of the Arab world, especially those associated<br/>&gt; with film music and other urban entertainment musics, are almost inevitably<br/>&gt; in 24tet.

However,<br/>the difference between 53-equal and Just/Pythagorean versions of Turkish<br/>scales is exceedingly small -- on the order of 0.1 to 1 cent -- far<br/>smaller than the deviations that would occur in even the most ideal<br/>musical circumstances. I&apos;ve played on a Turkish saz with very unevenly<br/>spaced frets but the smallest intervals were eighth-tones (approximately<br/>1/53 octave) and these tended to occur in pairs, dividing in half the<br/>second smallest interval (quartertones or 2/53 octave). The placing of<br/>these frets was surely too approximate to distinguish between 53-equal<br/>and JI/Pythagorean (by the latter I could mean either JI extended much<br/>farther along the 3-axis than the 5-axis, or Pythagorean with schismatic<br/>approximations to 5-limit intervals).</p></div><h3><a id=1825 href="#1825">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/1999 3:59:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Paul H.

In the end you just have to<br/>use your ear. Wilson has only taken it out to the 2nd order. The rules for<br/>these might be that the generator will always be subtended by the same<br/>number of steps and other intervals can be more flexible. This is besides<br/>the point, It makes more sense to investigate all the layers of MOS and<br/>find the scales and then figure out what it is they have in common. The ear<br/>is the leader</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But you can think of it<br/>&gt; &gt;as an MOS containing a MOS that is also a 1st order MOS. The cases with<br/>&gt; JI<br/>&gt; &gt;are referred to as Constant Structures meaning that they reflect the<br/>&gt; MOS as<br/>&gt; &gt;an archetype. I&apos;m sorry if this is not mathematically deterministic<br/>&gt; enough<br/>&gt; &gt;for you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s fine, I just think the non-MOS explanations work better.</p><p>But doesn&apos;t explain many usable scales, even the simple pentatonics found<br/>in the diatonic.

When you reply, please base it on Arabic music you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; HEARD, not medieval Arabic theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Gee, Maybe you would like me to send you pictures of the CD covers with<br/>&gt; &gt;String instruments with unequally spaced frets.<br/>&gt; &gt;[...]<br/>&gt; &gt;I hold by what I said In that I hear Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt;and certain neutral intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This doesn&apos;t contradict anything I said, Kraig!</p><p>I will take your word that there is 24et music in the near east.
