By 1980 I was using &quot;alternative tuning&quot; because<br/>frankly I had nothing in common with those doing &quot;microtonal&quot; music. Lately the<br/>term or activity, that has no meaning outside a western tradition, I am tending<br/>to associate with another type of Neo-classicism. A reactionary consertvativism (<br/>maybe reflecting the political current of the time). It looks backwards, attempts<br/>to reproduce, enhanced version of supposed past forms because of the superiority.<br/>It followed the revolution of the early century just as this follows the<br/>revolution of the 60&apos;s and the rise of third world musics . It realization of it<br/>unexpressed goal as far as I can guess might be a new golden age period of<br/>western music classics leading to the coming of the great microtonal Bach. Maybe<br/>an added Pelog, Slendro or Indian Drone.

Anything can be interesting from at least a theorectical viewpoint.  Unless and until you actually tune some instrument and play music using it, the results may not be easy to predict.  And whether you or anyone else is satisfied with the results is a subjective matter, largely dependent on one&apos;s past experience with  various scales and the musics deriving from them.<br/>Tempering a scale doesn&apos;t have to imply an equal tempering, as in the case of various &quot;meantone&quot; temperaments.  Some scales in just intonation may be subject to improvement by tempering as well.  And a lot depends on whether the music a scale is used for is mainly sequential or mainly simultaneous (melodic or harmonic), or even mainly rhythmic.  &quot;Native&quot; (not necessarily &quot;primitive&quot;) musics and scales pretty much run the gamut of possibilities among these three areas of concentration.

On the other hand, if you work in<br/>temperaments, unless your work is not tonal, you&apos;re probably going to think<br/>about -- if not hear -- your temperament in terms of JI.  When I read the<br/>word &quot;tempered&quot;, my first question is &quot;tempered from what?&quot;; in most cases,<br/>it is tempered from some form of JI.</p><p>A tuning like Werkmeister III isn&apos;t really re- tempered, it&apos;s just plain<br/>tempered.</p></div>
