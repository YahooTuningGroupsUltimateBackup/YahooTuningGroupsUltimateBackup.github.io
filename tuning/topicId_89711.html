It sounds like<br/>&gt; Dudon&apos;s approach, which builds irregularities in at the outset,<br/>&gt; would work better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I understand the hemififths setting as involving exactly half the<br/>&gt;&gt; perfect fifth, which, in the case of 41 or 58 notes is indeed a close<br/>&gt;&gt; approximation of 16/13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not terrifically close I would say, but that&apos;s what the regular<br/>&gt; mapping in this case is using. But if regularity is to be avoided,<br/>&gt; where does that leave that particular thought? Anyway, at least the<br/>&gt; fifths being divided as slightly sharp, not flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This interval or its siblings 11/9, 27/22,<br/>&gt;&gt; 49/40 and 60/49, the latter two among which I like the best, could<br/>&gt;&gt; indeed be taken as the generator of a 41-tone or 58-tone setting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By &quot;like&quot; do you mean as a means of tuning maqams, or your own<br/>&gt; personal taste? Splitting a pure fifth in half with 49/40-60/49<br/>&gt; brings to mind microtempering, but I don&apos;t think that would have<br/>&gt; much to do with the situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In<br/>&gt;&gt; fact, I have spent extensive time trying to settle the whole affair<br/>&gt;&gt; into 41 pitches in the octave with special emphasis on 49/40 and<br/>&gt;&gt; 60/49.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 41 tempers out 2401/2400, which means it would certainly be possible<br/>&gt; to produce some highly accurate 7-limit scales of 41 notes with a<br/>&gt; lot of these neutral thirds about. But again, where does that leave<br/>&gt; the question of relating all of that to maqam music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Simply taking 41-EDO seems a neat solution in itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A more reasonable plan than 53 from what I can see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But then<br/>&gt;&gt; again, there is the historical irregularity of Maqam music tuning(s)<br/>&gt;&gt; which we dismiss altogether.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The entire project of regularizing and systemizing is rather<br/>&gt; contrary to irregularities. You tend to be looking for ways to<br/>&gt; smooth those over and still produce acceptable results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nevertheless, one can object by saying<br/>&gt;&gt; that AEU or 24-EDO are also regular and taken with a grain of salt by<br/>&gt;&gt; performers. In such a case, a 41-EDO theoretical model consigned<br/>&gt;&gt; mostly to paper becomes viable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And that strikes me as a damn fine argument. It seems like a more<br/>&gt; reasonable theoretical model at the outset, and far less likely to<br/>&gt; cause harm if someone tries to enforce it, or produces instruments<br/>&gt; with the tuning built into it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The real problems emerge when you attempt to affix mandals on a qanun<br/>&gt;&gt; or frets on a tanbur according to such regular tunings or their<br/>&gt;&gt; hemififth siblings. They sound good and regular, but that feature is<br/>&gt;&gt; not exactly sought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps, but it strikes me that 24edo is even less sought. 41 equal,<br/>&gt; or a 41 note MOS, Hemififths[41], seems like it&apos;s more flexible and<br/>&gt; gets you closer to where you want to be, from what I can make of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I did get to the Tore-Karadeniz, a 41 note MOS with generator 31/106, representing 11/9, which is a &quot;hemigaribaldi&quot; system with wedgie &lt;&lt;2 -16 -28 5 -30 -50 1 -20 67 111||. Should 41&amp;106 temperament be known henceforth as Karadeniz?<br/>Anyway, obviously there&apos;s a lot of similarity between this and using 41 notes for a 29/99 generator MOS of hemififths.</p><p>&gt; Using any fifth larger than 700 cents means that you obtain perde<br/>&gt; segah, which is crudely equivalent to 5:4, in the Pythagorean manner,<br/>&gt; 8 fifths down from the tone of origin. Wider than pure fifths mean you<br/>&gt; are targetting the desirable perde segah (with maximum distance<br/>&gt; between dugah-segah (D-E) at 11:10 in regular Turkish practice). That<br/>&gt; is why I told Paul Erlich many years ago to his surprise that 29-EDO<br/>&gt; yields a better Rast than 53-EDO.</p><p>Ha, which means hemififths beats out karadeniz.</p><p>&gt; How does this have any bearing to tuning maqams? Note, that my<br/>&gt; previous attempts to formulate scales with stretched octaves depend on<br/>&gt; the &quot;schismas&quot; found between 11/9, 49/40, 60/49 and 27/22. What were<br/>&gt; they? They were, 441:440, 540:539 and 2401:2400. This last remnant<br/>&gt; brings to mind Uzdilek&apos;s attempt at creating a 2400-EDO unit as a<br/>&gt; rival to the Ellis cent!</p><p>I like 3600-EDO better than 2400-EDO.

Now stack this in a complete 9edo circle; that is, stack eight of these chains separated by 133 1/3 cents.

With both of these to use, you may already have made Necdet Yasar happy, except for the fact that there&apos;s no way to make these people happy, as the tuning is too variable.

Should 41&amp;106 temperament be known henceforth as<br/>&gt; Karadeniz?<br/>&gt; Anyway, obviously there&apos;s a lot of similarity between this and using<br/>&gt; 41 notes for a 29/99 generator MOS of hemififths.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The PFD file of my dissertation should work just fine.

Wider than pure fifths mean<br/>&gt;&gt; you<br/>&gt;&gt; are targetting the desirable perde segah (with maximum distance<br/>&gt;&gt; between dugah-segah (D-E) at 11:10 in regular Turkish practice). That<br/>&gt;&gt; is why I told Paul Erlich many years ago to his surprise that 29-EDO<br/>&gt;&gt; yields a better Rast than 53-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ha, which means hemififths beats out karadeniz.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Our latest research published in JNMR, which you can reach through my<br/>website, shows that Karadeniz scored the lowest in a comparison of<br/>theoretical models with measured peaks in collated frequency histograms. This is due more to the poor selection of tones for given<br/>maqams by Ekrem Karadeniz than the weakness of the 106-EDO 41-tone<br/>subset however.</p><p>&gt;&gt; How does this have any bearing to tuning maqams? Note, that my<br/>&gt;&gt; previous attempts to formulate scales with stretched octaves depend<br/>&gt;&gt; on<br/>&gt;&gt; the &quot;schismas&quot; found between 11/9, 49/40, 60/49 and 27/22. What were<br/>&gt;&gt; they? They were, 441:440, 540:539 and 2401:2400. This last remnant<br/>&gt;&gt; brings to mind Uzdilek&apos;s attempt at creating a 2400-EDO unit as a<br/>&gt;&gt; rival to the Ellis cent!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like 3600-EDO better than 2400-EDO. This has nothing to do with<br/>&gt; maqam music, it&apos;s just that if you tune in 3600 everything can be<br/>&gt; expressed in 7-limit terms, as it is a terrific tuning for<br/>&gt; ennealimmal temperament, which doesn&apos;t actually need terrific<br/>&gt; tunings to work.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well!</p><p>&gt; In any event, I note that (441/440)/(540/539) = 2401/2400 and<br/>&gt; 441/440 * 540/539 = 243/242, and tempering out any two of these gets<br/>&gt; you the rest.

However,<br/>manipulating those pitches with the above-mentioned 11-limit schismas<br/>and kleismas yielded these nice ratios:</p><p>96/77 at 381.8 cents (no prime 5 exponent)<br/>550/441 at 382.4 cents (all primes up to 11)<br/>343/275 at 382.5 cents (no prime 2 or 3 exponent)<br/>539/432 at 383.1 cents (no prime 5 exponent)</p><p>I am undecided as to which of the latter two ratios suit perde segah<br/>the best.

By no means do I say that maqams<br/>such as Rast or Segah MUST depend on the 382 cent pitch. Ask me a<br/>specific perde instance of a specific maqam in a given performance<br/>tradition by some performer, and I can at best voice my opinion as to<br/>the vague wide zone where that perde ought to be. My preference for<br/>the 382 cent perde segah rests on my demands that:</p><p>1. segah must be lower than 5/4<br/>2. segah must be higher than 56/45<br/>3. segah must make a neat Major chord when coupled with rast and neva.<br/>4. segah must not be 3-limit and at most 11-limit.</p><p>demands which have little or no bearing to the traditionalist views<br/>and practices dominating Maqam music.</p><p>For the sake of avoiding the argument, let&apos;s just say that the 382<br/>cent pitch is an acceptable segah instance for some (far from all)<br/>occasions.</p><p>In a similar light, we can seek such cool 7-prime ratios as 128/105,<br/>60/49, 49/40, 100/81, 315/256 OR 11-prime ratios as 11/9, 27/22,<br/>121/98, 99/80 for perde segah. Notice, that I am not putting emphasison one over the other. You can break the prime barrier to go up to 19<br/>and beyond if you like. I have my reasons not to do THAT.</p><p>Although you would expect the fifth complement of segah, which is<br/>perde evdj, to be so broad also, this is not the case. Evdj seldom<br/>goes so low. And with perde hisar, the perfect fourth complement of<br/>segah, you will see that the given ranges are divided and skewed each<br/>in opposite directions with an unfrequented maroon spot. You will also<br/>notice that perde saba in Saba does not behave the same as perde segah<br/>(or ushshaq) in Ushshaq. These are observations in one Ahenk/diapason<br/>only. Carry that over to the possible 12 or practiced 4-5 diapasons<br/>today, and the whole thing becomes very messy. I cannot give you all<br/>the details in one e-mail message, details which take years of<br/>learning, observation and practice.</p><p>&gt; The cycle of fifths contain<br/>&gt;&gt; 694 cent tempered fifths no better than 79 MOS 159-tET. Granted, &gt;&gt; there<br/>&gt;&gt; is a plethora of 7 and 11-limit intervals about, but this tuning is<br/>&gt;&gt; practically the same as 72-EDO, and does not very much improve on it.<br/>&gt;&gt; One can hardly see the benefits justifying the extra toil in affixing<br/>&gt;&gt; mandals at precisely calculated suggested positions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would only become apparent, I suspect, if you needed a lot of<br/>&gt; just 7-limit intervals, which 72 tries to deliver but doesn&apos;t quite<br/>&gt; manage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>7-limit is ok, 7-limit is cool. But you don&apos;t hear 4:5:6:7 in Maqam<br/>music circles. This is a novelty. The only 7-limit good for Maqam<br/>music is in obtaining middle seconds, middle thirds and augmented<br/>seconds. If you get minor sevenths and minor thirds in 7-limit, then<br/>all the better!</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=90023 href="#90023">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2010 5:30:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please excuse my ignorance - what is a &quot;hemififth&quot; ?</p><p>It means a half of a fifth, in other words, a neutraal third.

Its quality is evocative of a<br/>region between 370-384 cents. Ordinarily, one could demand a segah on<br/>the lower periphery for more conformity to tradition, but I insist on<br/>segah to nominally make a decent 4:5:6 along with rast and neva. Of<br/>course, segah can traditionally go as low as 340 cents or so.

Later in the 20th century its name became savart, after the French physicist F&eacute;lix Savart (1791-1841) who also advocated it. In French acoustical literature it&apos;s still used now and then. It is close to 100 times the base-10 logarithm of 2 and therefore almost as accurate as jots in calculations. So Sauveur proposed it because 301=7&times;43 and Savart because 301(.03) = 100&times;10log 2. Later the name savart was used in the book The Physics of Music by Alexander Wood to denote the slightly different value of 1/300 part of an octave. This would make it more practical for expressing 12-tET intervals.

There is, I notice, still no<br/>consensus as to 1/72 octave steps as being an innovation of<br/>Aristoxenus.

The qanun-players have been trying in vain to<br/>extricate themselves from the situation unknowingly by attempting to<br/>partition the 100 cent semitone to denser mandal arrays until a kind<br/>and merciful spirit (myself) told them that that approach will yield<br/>only multiples of 12-EDO for all intents and purposes.</p><p>And you&apos;ll notice, that while I admit 72-EDO is a very SOLID tuning,<br/>it is FAR from being RIGHT for Maqam music due to intonational and<br/>historical considerations.

Yes of course 612 is a multiple of 12-equal and<br/>&gt;&gt; is based on it for that very reason as well as on 17-EDO<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, it&apos;s important more because it&apos;s quite accurate, only<br/>&gt; secondarily because of the 12 thing. I used it for years as a way of<br/>&gt; figuring things without grabbing for a calculator, and the reason I<br/>&gt; did was that it was accurate.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hah hah! Come on! A. J. Ellis had suggested the cent unit because of<br/>the ease with which one can observe deviations from 12-equal pitches,<br/>not because it is any the easier compared to 159 or 612. 12-equal was<br/>the norm in the West when evaluating other (microtonal) scales and<br/>NATURALLY the cent unit has MOST DEFINITELY 12-equal as its basis.</p><p>And I know you have lost track again, so let me remind you once more<br/>my position: 72-equal HAS MOST DEFINITELY 12-equal at its core<br/>historically. The only way one can apply it to Maqam music without<br/>losing one&apos;s mind is again the same way the originators followed to<br/>conceive it: A bikechain of 6 twelve-tone equal tunings. This is<br/>INCOMPATIBLE with the historical and intonational spirit of Turkish<br/>Maqam music.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Frankly, I find your claims ridiculous and off-track. You know<br/>&gt;&gt; perfectly well that I am talking about tunings that can possible be<br/>&gt;&gt; IMPLEMENTED on acoustical instruments as a WHOLE. No such viable<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning that is a multiple of 12-equal will EVER do RIGHT by Maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; music, especially Turkish and Persian varieties that leave the Arabic<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;quarter-tones&quot; in the dust from the perspective of subtle<br/>&gt;&gt; microtonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is true, you can explain WHY it is true.

What, precisely and exactly stated, is the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; problem?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Why don&apos;t you buy a 72-EDO qanun from Turkiye, tune it, play it,<br/>&gt;&gt; imitate some maqams and see for yourself what the problems are with<br/>&gt;&gt; it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m physically incapable of playing anything well.

The only way one can apply it to Maqam music without<br/>&gt; losing one&apos;s mind is again the same way the originators followed to<br/>&gt; conceive it: A bikechain of 6 twelve-tone equal tunings.</p><p>I just got through pointing out to you what you can do with a bikechain of nine=tone equal tunings times eight-note tunings: you can take the nine bikechain with another chain of neutral thirds, and adjust the neutral thirds up to 351 cents and so the fifths up to 702 cents, with interesting consequences. Clearly, twelve is not the only useful way of looking at the thing; another approach focuses on the 7/72 generator, and so on and so on.</p></div><h3><a id=90113 href="#90113">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2010 12:46:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; These are, of course, your suppositions in assuming that Aristoxenus<br/>&gt; managed to utilize logarithmic functions to equally partition 2/1,<br/>&gt; functions which were actually discovered in 1544 by Michael Stifel or<br/>&gt; approximated by mesolabiums constructed during the time of Ptolemy.</p><p>I suggest you go look at the eighth book of Euclid&apos;s Elements.

I hardly<br/>&gt; think any theorist knew of such an interval as the &quot;octave&quot; in<br/>&gt; Antiquity, when instead they would have considered an &quot;octave&quot; as &quot;the<br/>&gt; same pitch&quot; and especially since they in fact took tetrachords and<br/>&gt; pentachords as the periodicities of their scales!</p><p>Oh, please. They had a name for it, &quot;diapason&quot;. How did they manage to name it without knowing it existed? Besides, they were not idiots, and would have noticed that when you stuck a fourth and a fifth together you did not get a unison. And where is your cite that they used tetrachordal periodicity, rather than sticking two of them together? It would be interesting if true, so I suspect it must be false or someone would have made a big deal of it on this list by now.</p><p>In any case, as I&apos;ve already pointed out to Carl, octaves are utterly irrelevant to the question of whether Aristoxenos intended parts of equal size.</p></div><h3><a id=90114 href="#90114">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2010 1:08:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s completely, totally, and 100% irrelevant.

For example, in my system using pure fourths, the middle second that goes with a 16/13 is 128/117. This makes for a very nice tetrachord, just beautiful, but so is 14/13 with 16/13.

Instead, it points up the fact that 72-equal is multifaceted in its relationships with other divisions of the octave (12 being but *one facet* among many), so that there are multiple paths that could lead one to 72.  The most you can say is that 72-equal has the potential of bringing together two different groups of microtonalists: those who seek new melodic &amp; harmonic resources by accurately approximating ratios with prime limit &gt;5, and those who seek these resources by subdividing the 12-tone division of the octave.</p><p>Oz, none of this has any relevance as to whether or not 72-equal is suitable for Maqam music, but if you&apos;re trying to make the point that it is not well suited for that purpose, then you need to focus on some better reasons.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=90162 href="#90162">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2010 12:06:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Cam.

The most you can say is that 72-equal has the potential<br/>&gt; of bringing together two different groups of microtonalists: those<br/>&gt; who seek new melodic &amp; harmonic resources by accurately<br/>&gt; approximating ratios with prime limit &gt;5, and those who seek these<br/>&gt; resources by subdividing the 12-tone division of the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz, none of this has any relevance as to whether or not 72-equal is<br/>&gt; suitable for Maqam music, but if you&apos;re trying to make the point<br/>&gt; that it is not well suited for that purpose, then you need to focus<br/>&gt; on some better reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=90169 href="#90169">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2010 12:13:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Could you make a .scl example?

The flats and sharps<br/>&gt; cannot be seperated by a step in 72-equal. What&apos;s the use of so many<br/>&gt; tones if you cannot split the sharps and flats the way people are used<br/>&gt; to expect in AEU? in 79/80 MOS 159-tET, they can be so split. This was<br/>&gt; a desiratum mentioned in my thesis.</p><p>But I thought AEU was wrong as well.  AEU is only a theory applied to<br/>the music.  The notation system you&apos;re implying in only one (Western!)<br/>way of writing maqam music.  With 159-tET, those intervals won&apos;t be<br/>separated by a step, they&apos;ll be separated by 3 steps, right?  You can<br/>get distinct intervals without multiplying 53 note equal temperament.<br/>But that seems to be how you got to 159 in the thesis.  How many<br/>fifths do you actually need in a chain in a realistic musical context?</p><p>&gt; Note, that I never considered 159 as a whole tuning in my thesis. It<br/>&gt; is used to explain the 79/80-tone subset, which can be explained by<br/>&gt; many other ways as delineated. The master tuning is 79-tones, which<br/>&gt; happen to match a subset of 159-equal and is deemed thus a MOS.</p><p>The natural conclusion would be that 79 or 80 notes from 159-equal<br/>defines a temperament class.  This is something Gene has given.  But<br/>he also says that the 7-limit isn&apos;t consistently mapped.  So, in fact,<br/>this MOS isn&apos;t defining a regular temperament.  What I decided is that<br/>the &quot;tritikleismic&quot; generator from 159-equal would work better.  So<br/>you&apos;d tune the 159 notes according to it, and then take the 79 or 80<br/>note subset.  The advantage should be improved accuracy.  The<br/>disadvantage may be that no 159 note MOS would give a consistent 79<br/>note subset with what you want.  Is this something you&apos;ve considered?</p><p>Even if this does work, maybe it&apos;s not the best way to do it.  In your<br/>thesis you jump straight to 159.  What are the problems with Miracle,<br/>Harry, Hemififths, Catakleismic, Cassandra, Orwell, Myna, Mystery, and<br/>so on?</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, you look at temperament classes with similar error/complexity<br/>&gt;&gt; trade-off to 72&amp;87, and the best is Harry (58&amp;72). &nbsp;And we all know<br/>&gt;&gt; about Miracle.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Note that it&apos;s often stated that the fifth shouldn&apos;t divide into equal<br/>&gt;&gt; neutral thirds in Middle Eastern music. &nbsp;Temper out either 243/242 or<br/>&gt;&gt; 2401/2400 and you guarantee that the neutral thirds are equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That means irregular pitch inflexions depending on the seyir of a<br/>&gt; particular maqam. If Arabs do well with 24-equal and Turks with AEU on<br/>&gt; paper, what prevents us from redefining the pitches in a little more<br/>&gt; detail again on paper with room for pitch inflexions?</p><p>What&apos;s irregular about choosing equal neutral thirds?  Is it an<br/>acceptable tuning or not?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Polyphony with traditional scales is a good target. &nbsp;Staff notation<br/>&gt;&gt; brings in different baggage. &nbsp;With equal neutral thirds, the dread<br/>&gt;&gt; number 72 rears its ugly head.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have always said that 72 is a solid solution, but alas, not<br/>&gt; particularly suitable for Maqam music due to being a Western<br/>&gt; contrivance with Western dodecaphony in mind.</p><p>This is the fallacy.

If you think, rather than &quot;neutral third... hm, too low of 350 cents, maybe it&apos;s a high minor third&quot;, more along the lines of &quot;let&apos;s try 18/17, followed by 8/7, then up about a 10/9 to a pure 4/3 from the starting tone...&quot; you&apos;ll be able to match the tunings played extremely well, such that it&apos;s recognizably &quot;the same&quot;.</p><p>Stepwise thinking within a simple Pythagorean structure, strong tendency toward superparticular steps</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you say that&apos;s 24-tET?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kinda, yeah.

The 79 from 159 MOS gives an<br/>&gt; inconsistent tuning to 9:8: the 9/8 above the root is not the same<br/>&gt; interval as that between 4/3 and 3/2.  I don&apos;t know why you chose a<br/>&gt; set of notes with this property.  The thesis presents this scale<br/>&gt; largely as a fait accompli.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One thing is certain, you cannot satisfy everybody even in theory<br/>&gt;&gt; with<br/>&gt;&gt; 41 or 34-equal. Only Western Turkiye may be absolutely pleased with<br/>&gt;&gt; one of these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Western Turkiye can be pleased with them, so much the better!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; On Jun 10, 2010, at 7:08 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note: Carl made some interesting points here that weren&apos;t addressed.<br/>&gt; I hope they will be when the Ozan layer recovers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                          Graham<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=90559 href="#90559">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2010 9:30:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The importance of the utilization of middle-seconds to Maqam music is<br/>&gt; evident.

Hemififths can do the Pythagorean thing, the neutral thirds thing, and the middle seconds thing and still looks good by your assessment of the requirements of maqam music.</p></div>
