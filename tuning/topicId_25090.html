The main &quot;adjustment&quot; is that<br/>augmented seconds are _larger_ than diminished fourths; but as for the<br/>most common intervals formed from six or fewer fifths or fourths,<br/>they&apos;re as easy to navigate on a keyboard as in Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Of course, this assumes a style using a regular major third of 8/22<br/>octave (~436.36 cents), a major attraction of the scale for me. (Note<br/>the &quot;implicit&quot; assumption that such thirds resolve very efficiently to<br/>stable fifths -- often the musical grammar can influence one&apos;s<br/>intonational phonetics, so to speak, as well as vice versa.) With<br/>other stylistic assumptions, the conclusions change.</p><p>Another question I&apos;ve seen raised: does 23-tET have anything like a<br/>perfect fifth?</p><p>When I considered this question, my guess was &quot;Yes,&quot; on the basic of<br/>experience with Pythagorean &quot;Wolf&quot; fifths (actually diminished sixths,<br/>e.g. G#-Eb, a Pythagorean comma narrower than 3:2) in certain timbres.</p><p>With the beating alleviated, a Wolf fifth _could_ sound like a usual<br/>fifth; Easley Blackwood, for example, suggested that both the<br/>Pythagorean fifth and the Wolf fifth could be taken as variants of the<br/>same basic interval category.</p><p>However, until I tuned 23-tET and tried some progressions, I couldn&apos;t<br/>be sure how those &quot;Darregized/Setharianized&quot; fifths would sound in<br/>context.</p><p>When I did tune it up, and tried a metallophone-like texture, I found<br/>that the fifths and fourths did sound like fifths and fourths -- but<br/>not necessarily quite like &quot;traditional&quot; ones. For example, 14/23<br/>octave might seem either like a usual fifth, or like a very small<br/>minor sixth resolving obliquely to 13/23 octave (almost identical to<br/>the Pythagorean Wolf).</p><p>My conclusion is that 23-tET does have recognizable fifths and<br/>fourths, which I can substitute under certain timbral conditions for<br/>the usual ones in familiar progressions. Of course, in part, this may<br/>be a question of &quot;categorical perception,&quot; or of hearing what one<br/>_expects_ to hear.</p><p>Does style play an important role in this: specifically, the use of<br/>fifths and fourths as the main stable concords? In a meantone-type<br/>style with stable thirds and sixths, would those same intervals have<br/>sounded less &quot;fifthlike&quot; or &quot;fourthlike&quot;?</p><p>To conclude, while emphasizing the value of experience and of creative<br/>thinking at all stages, I would also suggest that not all of us need<br/>to become world class geographers; some of us may focus on a specific<br/>neighborhood. Knowing one&apos;s own backyard is an honorable goal.</p><p>Here I might say that there is no one so well versed in her or his own<br/>neighborhood that he or she could not learn more from the perspective<br/>of a visitor; and there is no world geographer who could not learn<br/>more from the much more modestly travelled resident of a specific<br/>region, community, neighborhood, or backyard.</p><p>We are interdependent, and your unique contributions are a gift to us<br/>all, encouraging us to appreciate the incredible variety of tunings<br/>and to learn by direct experience as well as innovative reflection.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>The Clever Mr. Zill &#x3C;zenharmonic@yahoo.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2001 12:06:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>WITHALLDUERESPECT, Margo,</p><p>You just don&apos;t get it.
