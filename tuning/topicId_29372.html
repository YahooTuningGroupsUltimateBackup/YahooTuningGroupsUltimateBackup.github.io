For instance, 7;7+5 would<br/>be the diatonic scale in the 12-et, 7;19+12 would be the same scale<br/>in the 31-et, and 21;41+31 would be Blackjack. If n and m have a<br/>common factor of d, then we could have a sum of d different terms<br/>before the n+m. Thus 5+5;12+10 would be Paul&apos;s symmetrical decatonic,<br/>while 6+4;12+10 would be Paul&apos;s standard decatonic. 3+2+1;8+4 would<br/>be the scale C C# D E F G# in the 12-et. The notation is intended to<br/>cover all modes and transpositions of the scale in question.</p><p>We can extend this notation to muddles, by which I mean scales in<br/>temperaments of temperaments. Thus 7;19+12;41+31 would be the<br/>diatonic muddle of 31 notes tuned to Canasta but used as if they were<br/>31-equal; that is to say, a temperament of 31 notes. The 7;19+12;41+31<br/>muddle would not be the same as the 7;19+12;31+22 muddle, despite<br/>being diatonic scales patterns from 31 notes, since the first would<br/>be tempered according to Miracle and the 72-et, and the second<br/>according to Orwell and the 53-et.</p><p>To get an idea of how the Muddle Way might work let&apos;s look at the<br/>7;19+12;41+31 Miracle Muddle. If we go around the circle of fifths,<br/>we get the following scales:</p><p>0 [0 12 24 30 42 54 65] ~ 1-9/8-63/50-4/3-3/2-27/16-15/8</p><p>1,6,11,16,21,26 [0 12 23 30 42 54 65] ~ 1-9/8-5/4-4/3-3/2-27/16-15/8</p><p>2,7,12,17,22,27 [0 12 23 30 42 53 65] ~ 1-9/8-5/4-4/3-3/2-5/3-15/8</p><p>3,8,13,18,23,28 [0 11 23 30 42 53 65] ~ 1-10/9-5/4-4/3-3/2-5/3-15/8</p><p>4,9,14,19,24,29 [0 11 23 30 41 53 65] ~ 1-10/9-5/4-4/3-40/27-5/3-15/8</p><p>5,10,15,20,25 [0 12 24 31 42 54 65] ~ 1-9/8-63/50-27/20-3/2-27/16-15/8</p><p>We have five scales 2,7,12,17,22,27 which are close to JI diatonic<br/>major, and another five, 3,8,13,18,23,28 close to JI diatonic minor;<br/>moreover 1,6,11,16,21,26 closely approximates the Indian diatonic<br/>scale. Modulating down a fifth would take us from minor to major, and<br/>again to Indian. This suggests that some of the scales contained in<br/>the 12;19+12;41+31 muddle would be good 12-tone temperaments, not for<br/>common practice, but for advocates of certain kinds of JI.</p></div>
