Where it&apos;s zero, you get the typical meantone/diatonic tunings and multiples of those (5, 7, 12, 19, 24, 26, 31, 36, 38, 43, 45, 50, 55, 57, 62, 67, 69, 74, 76, 81, 86, 88, 93, 98, ...). Where it&apos;s 1, a step of the ET functions as a comma (3, 8, 10, 15, 17, 22, 27, 29, 34, 39, 41, 46, 48, 53, 58, 60, 65, 70, 72, 77, 79, 84, 89, 91, 96, ...) Not that 3-ET is likely to attract much interest, but technically there it is. Other ET&apos;s map the 81/80 to a larger number of steps.</p><p>But there&apos;s a small class of temperaments that map 81/80 to -1 steps, which has an interesting consequence: the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth ends up larger than the ordinary fifth, instead of smaller. This class includes 2, 4, 9, 14, 16, 21, 23, 28, 33, 35, 40, 47, 52, and 64-ET, which all have fifths flatter than just, so the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth is off by less than one step. (A similar situation arises in ET&apos;s with sharp fifths, like 39-ET and 58-ET, but the effect is less dramatic.) Starting with 35-ET, the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth (the 5-ET fifth) is marginally acceptable; in 47-ET, the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth is almost as good as the regular fifth. So you can use these ET&apos;s to play meantone-based music with interesting color variations in the fifths.</p><p>I can imagine that a similar sort of feature would be useful for other commas.</p></div><h3><a id=63595 href="#63595">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2006 12:48:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Another thing in it I found interesting is that Bosanquet proposes<br/>&gt; classifying equal temperaments according to &quot;order&quot; and &quot;class&quot;.</p><p>You&apos;re just learning this??</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=63596 href="#63596">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2006 1:14:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another thing in it I found interesting is that Bosanquet proposes<br/>&gt; &gt; classifying equal temperaments according to &quot;order&quot; and &quot;class&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re just learning this??</p><p>I knew he had positive and negative systems.

For pure Pythagorean, it is 3.846. For<br/>flat fifths, it becomes more irregular: 4 for 53-et, 4.5 for 118-et.<br/>For sharp fifths it becomes less irregular: 3.5 for 94-et, 3 for 41-et.</p></div><h3><a id=63795 href="#63795">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 12:59:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been looking at Bosanquet&apos;s &quot;On the Hindu Division of the Octave&quot;<br/>&gt; with an eye to improving the Wikpedia article on 22 equal. Another<br/>&gt; thing in it I found interesting is that Bosanquet proposes classifying<br/>&gt; equal temperaments according to &quot;order&quot; and &quot;class&quot;. The order of an<br/>&gt; equal temperament is what the corresponding val maps the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; comma to. For example, 12-et is of order 0, 53-et of order 1, and<br/>&gt; 22-et of order 2. Presumably also 19-et would be of order -1, and so<br/>&gt; forth. The class of an equal temperament is where 81/80 gets mapped<br/>&gt; to. Hence giving (order, class) goes a long way towards characterizing<br/>&gt; 5-limit equal temperaments completely; choosing one more suitable<br/>&gt; 5-limit comma (say, 3125/3072, or 15625/15552) would do so. Anyway,<br/>&gt; Bosanquet&apos;s order and class may be worth a Tonalsoft entry.</p><p>They should be linked to, and link from, the terms &quot;positive&quot;<br/>and &quot;negative&quot;, which were Bosanquet terms.</p></div><h3><a id=63801 href="#63801">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 1:33:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s interesting that this thread is headed in the<br/>&gt; &gt; same direction as what i just posted in response to<br/>&gt; &gt; Neil regarding pythagorean schismic near-equivalents<br/>&gt; &gt; of 5-limit JI ratios. Lentz ignores the skhisma<br/>&gt; &gt; difference is changing his discussion of srutis away<br/>&gt; &gt; from really large pythagorean ratios to their nearly<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalent but much simpler 5-limit cousins.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The trouble is, Pythagorean or schismatic tuning is *not* always a<br/>&gt; feature of the sruti scales that people put forth. I think the<br/>&gt; presence of the Sa-grama scale, and having 4 srutis for 9/8, 3 for<br/>&gt; 10/9, and 2 for 16/15, is a much better way to get a handle on what<br/>is<br/>&gt; going on. On your page, Mahadeven Ramesh gives the indian3 scale as<br/>&gt; his version of srutis, and this seems to be pretty typical. It isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, but does satisfy the above conditions. Consequently, I<br/>&gt; think Magic[22] or Shrutar[22] should probably be regarded as more<br/>&gt; authentic possibilities for a rationalized sruti system than<br/>&gt; Pythagorean or schismic approaches.</p><p>I don&apos;t think Magic[22] has any chance; does it even support the<br/>Modern Indian Gamut?</p></div>
