Her mother, my grandmother<br/>had been born in 1870, had learned piano in the 1870s,<br/>held the post of organist at the First Methodist Church<br/>in Harrisburg, PA from 1890 to 1893.  I have a distinct<br/>memory of my grandmother&apos;s playing hymns on the piano<br/>in 1944, when I was visiting my grandparents, emphasizing<br/>major chords as though they sounded very sweet and<br/>harmonious in a way which impressed me as not quite<br/>fitting with those chords as they sounded on the piano<br/>she was playing, although the ideal forms of those chords<br/>would, I thought, have sounded as my grandmother seemed<br/>to feel they sounded as she was playing them.  When I started<br/>playing a piano in quarter comma mean tone temperament<br/>I gained a very strong sense that NOW I understood how<br/>my grandmother might have played those chords with such<br/>passion and emphasis.  I do not have direct evidence of<br/>this, but I believe it is more likely than not that<br/>learning piano in a rural county in Pennsylvania in<br/>the 1870s, my grandmother&apos;s first experience of the<br/>piano was with an instrument tuned to quarter comma<br/>mean tone temperament or a tuning close to that.</p><p>    I believe that although one sings the notes DO and MI<br/>in succession and one speaks of a melodic interval between<br/>these notes rather than a harmonic interval between them,<br/>the sound of the DO is still reverberating in short term<br/>memory intensely as the MI begins to sound, so that the<br/>melodic interval inescapably has some of the character of<br/>a harmonic interval.</p><p>    This is my 386 to 408 cents&apos; worth anyway.  Maybe<br/>certain ancestral archetypes from a somewhat earlier<br/>age in music were impressed on me early in life<br/>without my understanding much about them, but maybe<br/>it is useful for me to indicate what I know of these<br/>possible traces of earlier ways of musical thinking -<br/>which may see a resurgence in the future.</p><p>    Dave Hill,  La Mesa, CA (not here for much longer)</p><p>although</p></div>
