What is the basis for naming new chords in this<br/>file, and on what basis are additional entries accepted?  Is this<br/>essentially a list of chord names that has accumulated in the course<br/>of tuning list communications?</p><p>I frequently like to try out just chords containing 13 to see how<br/>they are rendered in various tunings.  However, there are very few in<br/>this file, so I have had to make my own copy of the file containing<br/>the chords that I use.  With the frequent updates to Scala, it has<br/>become bothersome to have to copy my version of this file each time<br/>and to maintain it to keep current with official updates to the file,<br/>so I would like to have some chords added (with my proposed names<br/>given here, subject to review by others):</p><p>4:5:6:7:9:11  Harmonic Eleventh<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11:13  Harmonic Thirteenth<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11:13:15  Harmonic Fourteenth<br/>6:7:9:11:13  Tridecimal Subminor Ninth<br/>9:11:13:15  Isoharmonic Diminished Seventh</p><p>There is also another version of the diminished seventh that I use:</p><p>15:18:21:25  Contracting Diminished Seventh</p><p>In arriving at a name for this, I observed that there are already<br/>diminished seventh chords named:</p><p>10:12:14:17  Harmonic Diminished Seventh<br/>25:30:35:42  Diminished Seventh</p><p>The harmonic diminished seventh chord has the largest interval<br/>between the outer tones, hence most effictively resolves the<br/>diminished 7th interval (by expansion) to an octave.  My<br/>proposed &quot;contracting diminished seventh&quot; chord has the smallest<br/>interval between the outside tones, hence more effectively resolves<br/>the diminished 7th interval (by contraction) to a fifth.  (And<br/>perhaps someone can think of a better name for this chord that<br/>conveys the same meaning.)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=51744 href="#51744">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2004 7:43:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I welcome contributions to this file and I&apos;ve accepted<br/>them from others before.

In resolving a dissonant chord (such as a<br/>diminished seventh) to a consonant one, I believe that the most<br/>effective minor seconds are those that are in the neighborhood of 65-<br/>70 cents, and I reserve the right to respell a &quot;dissonant&quot; (in terms<br/>of traditional harmony) JI chord in such a way that minor seconds (if<br/>we may still call them by the name) will occur closest to this size<br/>range.</p><p>If a JI tuning provides the option of substituting a slightly higher<br/>leading tone than 15/8 in a V-I progression to make the dominant<br/>triad dissonant, I believe that this might serve to enhance the<br/>progression.  I would want to spell the interval between this raised<br/>leading tone and the tonic note as a second (not an augmented<br/>unison), but I expect that we might prefer to use a label other<br/>than &quot;minor second&quot;.</p><p>This sort of effect could also be accomplished using a temperament in<br/>the meantone family by substituting an enharmonic flat in place of<br/>the leading tone (e.g., G-Cb-D), but again I would want to respell<br/>the leading tone so that its resolution to the tonic would be by the<br/>interval of a second of some sort.  This could be readily<br/>accomplished by raising the leading tone (B) with a symbol indicating<br/>the 7-comma (63:64) -- B|) in sagittal notation.  This would be valid<br/>not only in the entire range of meantone temperaments (including 12-<br/>ET) but also in JI and in some other ETs with fifths wider than 700<br/>cents.

When we listen to a diatonic composition with only two<br/>voice parts (such as a Bach two-part keyboard invention), we are able<br/>to &quot;hear&quot; harmonies that are there only in the sense that they are<br/>implied by tonal relationships already familiar to both the composer<br/>and the listener.  A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic scale<br/>subset of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not<br/>have the same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression<br/>of intervals -- unless the composer had first written other<br/>(successful) pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the<br/>listener had also become familiar with them.  In other words, the<br/>diatonic system is really a musical language, and our success in<br/>creating music in alternative tunings may depend on our ability to<br/>create (or discover) other musical languages that are capable of<br/>becoming meaningful to the general listener.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=52004 href="#52004">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2004 10:25:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sounds like you&apos;re basically agreeing with Eytan Agmon.

I&apos;m<br/>curious to see how your pelogic system compares with the tuning Erv<br/>Wilson and I came up with many years ago.</p><p>In the summer of 1979 my wife and I rented a room at Erv&apos;s house<br/>while we were in the process of house-hunting.  One evening we were<br/>just sitting around in the living room with nothing in particular to<br/>do, when I suggested to Erv, &quot;Just for the fun of it, let&apos;s create a<br/>new tuning tonight.&quot;  He said okay, and what did I have in mind?  I<br/>suggested that it should have isoharmonic consonant chords with<br/>integers in the ratio a:b:c (such that c-b=b-a) contained within a<br/>low-error linear temperament, but what should a, b, and c be?</p><p>Just out of the blue, Erv suggested 11:13:15, so I got out a pencil<br/>and paper and my electronic calculator and started looking for a<br/>generating interval.  As it turned out, I didn&apos;t have to look very<br/>far, since the most obvious thing was to start with the three<br/>intervals in the chord, and I found that a generator of 11:15 taken<br/>to five places (+5G) came to within a few cents of 13/11.  Tempering<br/>11:15 wide by ~0.892 cents (for a generator of ~537.842c) gives an<br/>exact 11:13, so the max. error within the 11:13:15 triad equals the<br/>error of the generator.  I next discovered that the tone in the +4G<br/>position came within a few cents of 19/11, so a tetrad approximating<br/>11:13:15:19 was available without adding any more tones to the chain.</p><p>I then calculated a dozen or so tones in a chain and put the tuning<br/>on my Scalatron.  As I played various chords, it was clear that the<br/>11:13:15 and 11:15:19 triads and the 11:13:15:19 tetrad stood out as<br/>consonances among a host of other dissonant chords, but this was true<br/>only so long as I kept the tones above middle C.  While some timbres<br/>worked better than others and that percussive enveloping was better<br/>than sustained tones, I found that the pitch range was more important<br/>to the consonance of these chords (so this temperament would be ideal<br/>for tubular bells).  I also discovered that the tone at +8G is within<br/>a cent of 3/2 and that a lower octave of this pitch could be used as<br/>a bass note in conjunction with a consonant triad or tetrad, since it<br/>very nearly coincided with the first-order difference tones produced<br/>by these chords.</p><p>As I played with this new tuning, I couldn&apos;t help noticing its<br/>resemblance to the pelog scale, at which point I brought out an<br/>Indonesian gamelan recording from my non-12 record collection and<br/>played it, while adjusting the master oscillator on the Scalatron in<br/>an to attempt to match the pitches on the recording.  Lo and behold,<br/>all but one on the recording were right on, and even that one<br/>exception was not very far off.  I later compared the tones in this<br/>tuning with the cents values for a large number of examples of pelog<br/>scales given in Jaap Kunst&apos;s book and was able to confirm that my<br/>observations were correct.</p><p>MOS scales of this tuning have 5, 7, 9, 11, 20, and 29 tones, and the<br/>29-tone MOS scale is rather close to 29-ET.  But I don&apos;t recall<br/>anyone ever having mentioned that a subset of 29-ET is similar to<br/>pelog.</p><p>So how does this compare with your idea of what characterizes a<br/>pelogic temperament?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=52024 href="#52024">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2004 12:29:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic scale<br/>&gt;&gt; subset of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not<br/>&gt;&gt; have the same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression<br/>&gt;&gt; of intervals -- unless the composer had first written other<br/>&gt;&gt; (successful) pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the<br/>&gt;&gt; listener had also become familiar with them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Quite possible.

E. Logic&quot; system is actually the 5-limit temperament where<br/>135:128 vanishes. When octave-repetition is assumed, the generator<br/>typically comes out to about 522-523 cents. The octaves themselves<br/>can be left pure if necessary, or if not, stretched by about 6-7<br/>cents. A marimba-like timbre works well; strong harmonic timbres are<br/>not recommended. Mapped to the fourths of a standard<br/>keyboard, &apos;conventional music&apos; turns &quot;upside-down&quot;, keyboard minor<br/>triads becoming the approximate 5-limit major triads of this system,<br/>and vice-versa. Thus the same 5- and 7-note scales that &apos;conventional<br/>music&apos; is based on work great with this tuning; taken out any<br/>further, the generator will produce pairs of notes that are &quot;in the<br/>wrong order&quot; of pitch on the keyboard, a &quot;feature&quot; Erv&apos;s notation is<br/>clearly intended to help accomodate.</p><p>I&apos;m dubious as to the relevance of proportions like 11:13 to<br/>inharmonic or percussive timbres when distortion or lower members of<br/>a common harmonic series aren&apos;t used. However, I find that some<br/>simple 5-limit harmonies can be evoked effectively even when the<br/>errors are fairly large, just as a single holistic pitch can be<br/>evoked by an overtone series in which the overtones are displaced by<br/>fairly large amounts.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; curious to see how your pelogic system compares with the tuning<br/>Erv<br/>&gt; &gt; Wilson and I came up with many years ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s closer to what Erv described in 1975 as a &quot;septimally<br/>negative&quot;<br/>&gt; system on page 10 of _On Linear Notations and the Bosanquet<br/>&gt; Keyboard_, Xenharmonikon 3:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF</a></p><p>Yes, that&apos;s closer, but Erv didn&apos;t indicate a 29-tone octave, which<br/>would be closest to the pelogic temperament that I ended up with (4<br/>years later).</p><p>&gt; My &quot;P. E. Logic&quot; system is actually the 5-limit temperament where<br/>&gt; 135:128 vanishes. When octave-repetition is assumed, the generator<br/>&gt; typically comes out to about 522-523 cents. The octaves themselves<br/>&gt; can be left pure if necessary, or if not, stretched by about 6-7<br/>&gt; cents. A marimba-like timbre works well; strong harmonic timbres<br/>are<br/>&gt; not recommended. Mapped to the fourths of a standard<br/>&gt; keyboard, &apos;conventional music&apos; turns &quot;upside-down&quot;, keyboard minor<br/>&gt; triads becoming the approximate 5-limit major triads of this<br/>system,<br/>&gt; and vice-versa. Thus the same 5- and 7-note scales<br/>that &apos;conventional<br/>&gt; music&apos; is based on work great with this tuning; taken out any<br/>&gt; further, the generator will produce pairs of notes that are &quot;in the<br/>&gt; wrong order&quot; of pitch on the keyboard, a &quot;feature&quot; Erv&apos;s notation<br/>is<br/>&gt; clearly intended to help accomodate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m dubious as to the relevance of proportions like 11:13 to<br/>&gt; inharmonic or percussive timbres when distortion or lower members<br/>of<br/>&gt; a common harmonic series aren&apos;t used.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that harmonics are largely irrelevant to the success of my<br/>isoharmonic pelogic temperament (what I&apos;ll have to call it, until<br/>someone thinks of a better name), hence selection of timbre is not of<br/>great importance.  If the tones are kept in a range above 260 hz,<br/>then the beating between the lower harmonics starts to become too<br/>rapid to be perceived, so that these intervals could be interpreted<br/>as having their own identities.  But even so, whether anyone might<br/>hear 11:13 as having a separate identity or as some sort of minor<br/>third probably has little or no bearing on the success of this scale.</p><p>One thing that I did observe is that 11:15 resembles 3:4 somewhat in<br/>that it tends to establish the upper tone of the ratio as a root of a<br/>chord containing this interval, so melodies in a scale subset of this<br/>temperament are very definitely not atonal.  While the 11:13:15 triad<br/>gives the general impression of 6:7:8 (or to a lesser extent of<br/>15:18:20), it quickly becomes evident that the relative consonance of<br/>chords is not the same as in a 5-limit or 7-limit tuning.  Since<br/>chordal consonance is established by the near-coincidence of first-<br/>order difference tones, the only timbral requirement is that there be<br/>a strong fundamental (so strong harmonic timbres, though not optimal,<br/>are not excluded), making this an ideal tuning for timbres with<br/>inharmonic partials that do not overpower the fundamental.  Examples<br/>of instruments that I think would work well in an ensemble using this<br/>tuning are tubulongs, recorders, and a bass marimba (the latter<br/>consisting of several bars tuned to match first-order difference<br/>tones of a few consonant chords).</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t notate my isoharmonic pelogic tuning as a chain of<br/>unaltered fifths, inasmuch as its 9-tone MOS scale results in an<br/>almost exact 2:3 between the tones at each end of the chain.</p><p>Clearly, you and I have taken very different approaches in arriving<br/>at a pelogic tuning.</p><p>Getting back to your pelogic scale:</p><p>&gt; However, I find that some<br/>&gt; simple 5-limit harmonies can be evoked effectively even when the<br/>&gt; errors are fairly large, just as a single holistic pitch can be<br/>&gt; evoked by an overtone series in which the overtones are displaced<br/>by<br/>&gt; fairly large amounts. This is suggested by the clarity with which<br/>the<br/>&gt; following example is heard as being a single voice, where the<br/>&gt; *timbre* is composed of 6 sine-wave partials tuned to a<br/>&gt; pelogic &apos;major chord&apos;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/Erlich/dave.wav">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/Erlich/dave.wav</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The partials do not fall apart into individual tones, the way the<br/>&gt; partials of, say, a carillon bell do. Similarly, the triads of<br/>&gt; pelogic, when the timbres are &apos;gentle&apos; enough, manage to &apos;cohere&apos;<br/>as<br/>&gt; harmonic entities, made all the more appealing by the unusual<br/>melodic<br/>&gt; structure of the scales they arise from.</p><p>Yes, the example in the file sounds very much like tones with<br/>harmonic partials, so much so that I was tempted to ask you if you&apos;re<br/>sure that&apos;s the right file!  I find that the duration of each tone is<br/>not long enough for me to home in on any difference I might hear<br/>between these and tones with true harmonics.</p><p>But I, in turn, am dubious as to the usefulness of a tuning that<br/>requires artificial timbres containing a distorted harmonic series in<br/>order to be successful.  I think that you would have to go to a lot<br/>of trouble to create any music of this sort, and it would seem to<br/>exclude virtually all acoustic instruments.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=52065 href="#52065">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2004 11:10:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, we were unable to deliver your message to the following address.</p><p>&lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;:<br/>Remote host said: 451 connection to mail server timed out (#4.4.1)</p><p>--- Below this line is a copy of the message.<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The final bin is one we don&apos;t use, because in fact we *are* thinking<br/>&gt; of meantone, not JI.

E. Logic&quot; system is actually the 5-limit temperament where<br/>&gt; &gt; 135:128 vanishes. When octave-repetition is assumed, the<br/>generator<br/>&gt; &gt; typically comes out to about 522-523 cents. The octaves<br/>themselves<br/>&gt; &gt; can be left pure if necessary, or if not, stretched by about 6-7<br/>&gt; &gt; cents. A marimba-like timbre works well; strong harmonic timbres<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; not recommended. Mapped to the fourths of a standard [...]</p><p>&gt; One thing that I did observe is that 11:15 resembles 3:4 somewhat<br/>in<br/>&gt; that it tends to establish the upper tone of the ratio as a root of<br/>a<br/>&gt; chord containing this interval, so melodies in a scale subset of<br/>this<br/>&gt; temperament are very definitely not atonal.</p><p>Yes, this is exactly what happens in my &apos;pelogic&apos;.</p><p>&gt; While the 11:13:15 triad<br/>&gt; gives the general impression of 6:7:8 (or to a lesser extent of<br/>&gt; 15:18:20), it quickly becomes evident that the relative consonance<br/>of<br/>&gt; chords is not the same as in a 5-limit or 7-limit tuning.  Since<br/>&gt; chordal consonance is established by the near-coincidence of first-<br/>&gt; order difference tones,</p><p>Bill Sethares&apos;s book _Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale_ examines many<br/>theories of consonance and delivers its strongest rejection to<br/>theories based on difference tones. I think the truth lies somewhere<br/>between you and Bill.</p><p>&gt; the only timbral requirement is that there be<br/>&gt; a strong fundamental (so strong harmonic timbres, though not<br/>optimal,<br/>&gt; are not excluded), making this an ideal tuning for timbres with<br/>&gt; inharmonic partials that do not overpower the fundamental.</p><p>These are exactly the kind of timbres I was referring to above, and<br/>in the other posts I&apos;ve made on this tuning to these lists.</p><p>&gt; Clearly, you and I have taken very different approaches in arriving<br/>&gt; at a pelogic tuning.</p><p>There are some very strong similarities as well.</p><p>&gt; Getting back to your pelogic scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, I find that some<br/>&gt; &gt; simple 5-limit harmonies can be evoked effectively even when the<br/>&gt; &gt; errors are fairly large, just as a single holistic pitch can be<br/>&gt; &gt; evoked by an overtone series in which the overtones are displaced<br/>&gt; by<br/>&gt; &gt; fairly large amounts. This is suggested by the clarity with which<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; following example is heard as being a single voice, where the<br/>&gt; &gt; *timbre* is composed of 6 sine-wave partials tuned to a<br/>&gt; &gt; pelogic &apos;major chord&apos;:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/Erlich/dave.wav">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/Erlich/dave.wav</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The partials do not fall apart into individual tones, the way the<br/>&gt; &gt; partials of, say, a carillon bell do. Similarly, the triads of<br/>&gt; &gt; pelogic, when the timbres are &apos;gentle&apos; enough, manage to &apos;cohere&apos;<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic entities, made all the more appealing by the unusual<br/>&gt; melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; structure of the scales they arise from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the example in the file sounds very much like tones with<br/>&gt; harmonic partials, so much so that I was tempted to ask you if<br/>you&apos;re<br/>&gt; sure that&apos;s the right file!  I find that the duration of each tone<br/>is<br/>&gt; not long enough for me to home in on any difference I might hear<br/>&gt; between these and tones with true harmonics.</p><p>Yup -- if you try dave1.wav instead, you&apos;ll hear a single tone held<br/>long enough to hear those differences.</p><p>&gt; But I, in turn, am dubious as to the usefulness of a tuning that<br/>&gt; requires artificial timbres containing a distorted harmonic series<br/>in<br/>&gt; order to be successful.</p><p>You must have completely misunderstood what I wrote. Please re-read<br/>what I say above about timbre, and refer to the original message if<br/>necessary. I had an easy time finding appropriate timbres, both among<br/>the presets on my Ensoniq keyboard, and on Ara&apos;s computer&apos;s MIDI<br/>soundcard.</p><p>&gt; I think that you would have to go to a lot<br/>&gt; of trouble to create any music of this sort, and it would seem to<br/>&gt; exclude virtually all acoustic instruments.</p><p>I agree. However, the approach of matching custom-designed tunings<br/>and timbres, though not at all what I was suggesting here, *is* a<br/>very attractive one, as Bill Sethares&apos;s musical examples (now a<br/>significant corpus) charmingly demonstrate. For some of<br/>the &quot;exotemperaments&quot; I described recently, such as &quot;grandpa&quot;<br/>and &quot;nana&quot;, such an approach would indeed be recommended.</p></div><h3><a id=52075 href="#52075">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2004 3:29:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

If the<br/>fundamental is strong in amplitude (relative to the other partials),<br/>then first-order difference tones will play a very significant role.</p><p>In a tuning that has no 9-limit consonances (such the 9-tone MOS<br/>subset of my isoharmonic pelog, assuming that we disregard the<br/>leftover 3:4 for the purposes of this discussion), all of the<br/>intervals are so dissonant that any chords constructed from them are<br/>also expected to be dissonant, and usually *more* so, since the<br/>dissonance of the individual component intervals is compounded.  But<br/>if chords constructed from dissonant intervals have coinciding first-<br/>order difference tones, they are actually perceived as being<br/>significantly *less* dissonant than any of the intervals which they<br/>contain.  Hence it is meaningful to treat these isoharmonic chords as<br/>consonances to which dissonant non-isoharmonic chords may resolve.<br/>So I view consonance and dissonance in such a tuning in relative<br/>terms, for if we were to compare these &quot;consonances&quot; with chords made<br/>up of 9-limit consonances using harmonic timbres, we would<br/>undoubtedly judge the 9-limit chords to be much more consonant.</p><p>My purpose in bringing up the isoharmonic pelog tuning is to make the<br/>point that a complete harmonic system (allowing resolution of<br/>dissonance to consonance) may be created, in analogy to our present<br/>diatonic system, that is suitable for non-harmonic timbres using a<br/>scale (pelog) that the musical world has generally viewed as being<br/>unsuitable for harmony.  Just as the tones in the diatonic scale are<br/>contained collectively in its three principal triads, all of the<br/>tones of the 9-tone MOS scale are contained collectively in the four<br/>11:13:15 triads built on consecutive roots in a chain of the ~11:15<br/>generator.</p><p>&gt; Nevertheless, should you be interested in pelog-like tunings<br/>&gt; featuring coinciding difference tones, I would encourage you to<br/>look<br/>&gt; into Kraig Grady&apos;s work -- he has shown that among the simplest<br/>&gt; scales produced purely from the coinciding difference tone point of<br/>&gt; view, one finds a curiously authentic pelog (as well as a curiously<br/>&gt; authentic mavila).

A bunch<br/>of<br/>&gt; us<br/>&gt; &gt; had an offlist conversation with him a while back, and were pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; hasty to reject his theory. Maybe you should have been in on<br/>&gt; it . . .<br/>&gt; &gt; of course, you probably would stop short of agreeing with him<br/>that<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;  number of buckets can be 8, 12, 16, . . . for &quot;cognitive&quot; (or<br/>&gt; &gt; something) reasons -- including a requirement of one and only one<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;ambiguous&apos; interval (the half-octave, which is either a<br/>diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; this or an augmented that in all these systems) -- and that<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustics narrows the choice down to 12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I would indeed limit the number of &quot;buckets&quot; to 12 for<br/>cognitive<br/>&gt; reasons.  When we listen to a diatonic composition with only two<br/>&gt; voice parts (such as a Bach two-part keyboard invention), we are<br/>able<br/>&gt; to &quot;hear&quot; harmonies that are there only in the sense that they are<br/>&gt; implied by tonal relationships already familiar to both the<br/>composer<br/>&gt; and the listener.  A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic<br/>scale<br/>&gt; subset of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not<br/>&gt; have the same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression<br/>&gt; of intervals -- unless the composer had first written other<br/>&gt; (successful) pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the<br/>&gt; listener had also become familiar with them.  In other words, the<br/>&gt; diatonic system is really a musical language, and our success in<br/>&gt; creating music in alternative tunings may depend on our ability to<br/>&gt; create (or discover) other musical languages that are capable of<br/>&gt; becoming meaningful to the general listener.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>***Well, this is an interesting thought.  My *own* personal<br/>experience is that people (even the composer!)tend to &quot;shoehorn&quot;<br/>exotic harmonies into our traditional 12-tET harmonic common<br/>practice, so it takes quite a bit of skill and careful scale<br/>selection to go beyond that.</p><p>I guess it&apos;s a kind of constructional &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; only, in<br/>this case, we&apos;re concerned with the approximation to a remembered<br/>common practice, rather than to individual consonant intervals...</p><p>This is &quot;sociological harmonic entropy...&quot;  :)</p><p>J.

Beethoven wrote counterpoint not infrequently,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I couldn&apos;t tell you how it&apos;s more &quot;full-chordal&quot; than Bach&apos;s.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The Bach counterpoint in question had only two voices.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, but Bach himself, and many before him, wrote counterpoint<br/>&gt;&gt; with three and more voices.  And I would argue the tonal context<br/>&gt;&gt; George was talking about was in place by Bach&apos;s time.  I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt;&gt; thinking lately about the coexistence of contrapuntal and tonal<br/>&gt;&gt; machinations and it strikes me that Bach does very well at this,<br/>&gt;&gt; but he was neither the first nor the last.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;***But, I think there is a difference in &quot;harmonic motion,&quot; Carl.<br/>&gt;In Bach, although there are &quot;key regions&quot; there is so much linearity<br/>&gt;going on that it&apos;s a bit more related to the linear counterpoint of<br/>&gt;the Renaissance and earlier ages.  By Beethoven, definite chord<br/>&gt;areas are established and maintained,</p><p>I&apos;m not sure this is true of Beethoven&apos;s strictly contrapuntal<br/>material.  You can hear him reaching for it, but you can hear him<br/>breaking into interludes when he needs tonal variation.  I&apos;m not<br/>sure he ever achieves it.  I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s possible.</p><p>His music as a whole is definitely more tonal and less linear than<br/>Bach&apos;s as a whole.  He&apos;ll take a contrapuntal idea and treat it as<br/>an atom in a larger structure (coming to mind is piano sonata 13,<br/>3rd mvmt.).  But within a contrapuntal atom, I can&apos;t think of an<br/>example that&apos;s more tonal than your average Bach.</p><p>An interesting try on the tonal + counterpoint thing is<br/>Shostakovich&apos;s 24 Preludes &amp; Fugues.  He&apos;ll do things like<br/>transpose down a wholetone in the middle of a theme.</p><p>I forget exactly how this relates to George&apos;s point.  Do we hear<br/>tonal motion in the 2-part Inventions that people of Bach&apos;s day<br/>did not?  Maybe, but I tend to doubt it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=52167 href="#52167">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2004 12:12:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; The musical mainstream has dried up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;***The Rap music that I hear sure seems to be in an &quot;alternate<br/>&gt;tuning...&quot;  :)</p><p>As I&apos;ve pointed out here before, eminem has featured blatantly<br/>microtonal scales on synth leads in Top 40 hits.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=52192 href="#52192">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2004 2:08:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_51743.html#52042">/tuning/topicId_51743.html#52042</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi George,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Do are you talking about 12-et, or the diatonic scale?

I would urge you to read a theory<br/>text on this, such as the wonderful Elie Siegmeister, _Harmony and<br/>Melody_ if you can find it in the library.  Of course, we were<br/>friends of Siegmeister, so I admit a certain bias... :)</p><p>&gt; So like Bach has &quot;tonal regions&quot; which are fairly<br/>&gt; long (have lots of notes in them), to allow lots of<br/>&gt; counterpoint.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, yes, some passages have a slow &quot;harmonic rhythm,&quot; (the term<br/>generally used for this) but some have fast ones, so it &quot;depends...&quot;</p><p>&gt; I was thinking some Phish jams might be good examples<br/>&gt; of tonality with counterpoint, but the sample I listened<br/>&gt; to last night was all tonal-region (actually, most of<br/>&gt; it was completely static).
