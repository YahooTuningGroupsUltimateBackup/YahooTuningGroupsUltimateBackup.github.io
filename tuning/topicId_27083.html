I don&apos;t think you get lost on this guitar. With a<br/>good background harmony, your ears tell you where to go and you don&apos;t really<br/>need to look at your fingers. Playing for instance a 24-tet guitar is much<br/>more difficult in my experience.</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p><p>----------<br/>&gt;De&nbsp;: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&Agrave; : <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;Objet&nbsp;: [tuning] Re: Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s Dinarra (was: A new era in JI guitar<br/>design!)<br/>&gt;Date&nbsp;: Mar 14 ao&ucirc; 2001 1:04<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Yes, I met Eduardo at the Microthon, where he had (Dave, you&apos;re not<br/>&gt; going to believe this) one guitarist playing chords on a 12-tET<br/>&gt; guitar, and the other guitarist playing lead on the Dinarra. We&apos;ve<br/>&gt; known about his 53-tone, 1/9-schisma tempered guitars for a long<br/>&gt; time . . . it&apos;s logical to have all 53 frets because the smallest<br/>&gt; (~1/53 octave, or a comma) interval will pop up between some pair of<br/>&gt; frets even if you plan to play in only one key! You don&apos;t get lost<br/>&gt; because (a) the fretting is unequal, and (b) color coding is used.</p></div><h3><a id=27101 href="#27101">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2001 2:46:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Wim Hoogewerf&quot; &lt;wim.hoogewerf@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I actually played a little on the Dinarra after the Microthon 2000<br/>concert.<br/>&gt; Eduardo told me that the system was not exactly 53-tet</p><p>Right, it&apos;s a 53-tone chain of 52 fifths tempered by 1/9-schisma.<br/>It&apos;s certainly not 54, as Johnny suggested . . . correct?</p><p>&gt; and that the main<br/>&gt; musical purpose was to give expression to intervals in the same way<br/>singers<br/>&gt; can do, even when they are accompanied by a 12-tet instrument like<br/>the piano<br/>&gt; or a guitar.
