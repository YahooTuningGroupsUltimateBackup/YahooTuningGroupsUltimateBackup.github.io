Real<br/>Hungarian folkmusic, Roma folkmusic, composed hungarian &quot;Nota&quot;<br/>(restaurant music), and music of all the neighbor nations.  And what<br/>about a region like Erdely (Transylvannia -- since Trianon treaty<br/>belonging to Romania)?

I can now sing straight comma scales. Did it for<br/>Joseph but he says he can&apos;t hear that finely.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then I demonstrated commas on an alto recorder (for which I posted<br/>fingerings<br/>last year) and then I sang what I played. It was easy to check because I<br/>first outlined the schisma by isolating the distinction between the equal<br/>tempered fifth and the perfect fifth. Composer Alyssa Ryvers was visiting<br/>and she exclaimed, &quot;the cent is big!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finally, I have been recording improvisations for composer Patrick Grant.<br/>He<br/>tuned up a Kurtzweil (sic) synthesizer to single cent increments. I sang<br/>along.<br/>Then I asked him to sing a long with me a cappella. After resisting a bit<br/>(because it was uninteresting to him), he joined in and we easily began an<br/>ascent in single cents.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not think, with a bit of training, musicians with good pitch<br/>distinction<br/>could fail to appreciate single cents.&quot;</p><p>&quot;best, Johnny Reinhard&quot;</p><p>*******</p><p>What happened on that day at my studio was this:</p><p>The session on June 24, 2002 started late (again) so I was irritable to<br/>begin with. I wanted to get down to the task at hand, which was recording,<br/>so any account of me being disinterested in hearing a cent should be put in<br/>context. I have done experiments like this with my micro tunable keyboards<br/>before so this was not anything new to me and was &quot;gee whiz-y&quot; at best.</p><p>Still, upon his insistence, I created a user definable scale on the Kurzweil<br/>of 12 pitches, all a cent apart, in the middle C (C4 in MIDI parlance)<br/>octave. This made the highest pitch in the scale (assigned to the key B4) 12<br/>scents above middle C (C4). Timbrally, we used the grand piano samples.</p><p>Not looking at the keyboard and seeing the keys that I was hitting JR could,<br/>every time, tell which adjacent notes were higher or lower, by a cent (i.e.<br/>F4 to F#4 or A4 to Bb4) and I could hear them too. Anybody can when they are<br/>played that isolated and that long in duration. Truly.</p><p>However, the one thing that couldn&apos;t be done with any accuracy was to, say,<br/>play non-adjacent notes and have him say how far apart they were. That is to<br/>say, to hit the keys C4 and G4 and have him exclaim &quot;Oh, that&apos;s 7 cents<br/>apart&quot; or E4 and G#4 and say &quot;Oh, now that&apos;s 4 cents apart.&quot;</p><p>Yes, I was resistant in singing single cent increments because I was like<br/>&quot;OK, I get it. Could we get on with what we&apos;re here for?&quot; more than anything<br/>else. The session was on my clock after all. It had nothing my lack of<br/>interest in microtunings nor with having to do with me not finding JR<br/>endlessly fascinating and enlightening.</p><p>In summary, yes, JR can hear single cents when they are adjacently placed. I<br/>believe anybody can when a precision instrument of any kind is used. The<br/>real trick is finding anybody who could nail down, with accuracy, pitches<br/>that are non-adjacent and not necessarily either ascending or descending.</p><p>-PG<br/><a href="http://www.patrickgrant.com">www.patrickgrant.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=44874 href="#44874">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2003 6:39:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Patrick Grant&quot; &lt;pg@p...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_44851.html#44873">/tuning/topicId_44851.html#44873</a></p><p>&gt; In summary, yes, JR can hear single cents when they are adjacently<br/>placed.
