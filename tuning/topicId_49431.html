One test will involve taking many readings<br/>from the same test sound and looking at the coefficient of variation in the data<br/>acquired. This procedure will be repeated at various pitch levels within the range of<br/>the instrument. I am hoping the spread in the raw data thus obtained will give me a<br/>measure of accuaracy of the system.</p><p>Another test will involve feeding two sounds into the system - one sound at a time -<br/>with fundamentals that are very close and narrowing down the difference between the<br/>fundamentals until the system can no longer detect the difference between the two<br/>test sounds. This test should give me a measure of the resolution of the system.</p><p>Hi Can,</p><p>Given this kind of test, it sounds like you could make use of a &quot;sample playback&quot;<br/>machine or software. These are devices or software that can play back a given<br/>sample (in your case one of the desired instrumental sounds) at any desired<br/>fundamental frequency.</p><p>There are many such around - Vsamp is a free one, NI&apos;s Kontakt and Bitheadz<br/>Unity are pro versions. Any of these will allow you to use your own sample, choose<br/>the fundamentals (via MIDI) and then you could test your system as much as<br/>you want.</p><p>These do not, however, do the analysis portion for you, and<br/>hence are simpler than your original question...</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
