I teach by imitation of basic melodic phrases that characterize each maqam, presenting the details as part of the whole picture. To get a feel for how I teach, please visit <a href="http://maqamlessons.com">http://maqamlessons.com</a></p><p>&#xFFFD;A maqam (Arabic melodic mode) is inseparable from the melodies and melodic phrases that give it its particular character; hence I present the theory and analysis of maqam through the use of melody, rather than abstract scales or formulas. Melodic phrases, like sentences in spoken language, contain all of the important musical information, all of the details of intonation, ornamentation, rhythm, phrasing, and modal attraction&#xFFFD;as well as that indescribable quality we call &#xFFFD;feel.&#xFFFD; Melody is also something accessible to all, whatever their musical level or ability. The universal ability to imitate melody, I have found, is the best avenue for approaching both theory and practice&#xFFFD;and learning how to build one&#xFFFD;s sense of each maqam through the gradual accumulation of characteristic melodies is the most valuable lesson I can impart to students, scholars, and audiences.&#xFFFD;</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>Sami Abu Shumays<br/>Arabic Violinist<br/>   <a href="http://www.samimusicworld.com">http://www.samimusicworld.com</a><br/>   <a href="http://myspace.com/samiabushumays">http://myspace.com/samiabushumays</a><br/>Director of Zikrayat<br/>   <a href="http://www.zikrayatmusic.com">http://www.zikrayatmusic.com</a><br/>   <a href="http://myspace.com/zikrayatmusic">http://myspace.com/zikrayatmusic</a><br/>Arabic Music Podcast: &quot;Personal Performances&quot;<br/>   <a href="http://shumays.libsyn.com">http://shumays.libsyn.com</a><br/>Online Maqam Lessons<br/>   <a href="http://maqamlessons.com">http://maqamlessons.com</a><br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>More photos; more messages; more storage&#xFFFD;get 5GB with Windows Live Hotmail. <a href="http://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507">http://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507</a></p></div>
