Michael will correct me if I&apos;m wrong<br/>about it.</p><p>He is after periodic scales that have at least 7 tones in one period.<br/>The period can be an octave or something more exotic like a tritave<br/>or phi-tave. Now what he wants is that any combination of tones will<br/>sound &quot;good&quot; and preferably have pretty much equal amount of<br/>consonance/dissonance/tension so that no strong hierarchies of<br/>intervals or chords are established. This should allow more freedom<br/>in combining melodies than traditional diatonic scales allow. A sort<br/>of atonality without the negative connotation of dissonance, am I<br/>right Michael? This I understand is the primary goal, considerations<br/>of difference tones, beat rates and use of rational/irrational<br/>numbers are secondary concerns. Now Michael, will you confirm this<br/>is your goal and if it isn&apos;t then exactly what is?</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=82932 href="#82932">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>4/16/2009 8:06:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--&quot;The period can be an octave or something more exotic like a tritave<br/>--or phi-tave.&quot;&nbsp; -Kalle<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agreed. :-)&nbsp; A general pattern I&apos;ve noticed with noble-number-generated scales, for example, is it&apos;s quite often best to use the noble-number itself as the period (and that using the 2/1 octave as the period in such cases I&apos;ve found actually causes horrific dissonance).&nbsp;</p><p>--&quot;Now what he wants is that any combination of tones will<br/>--sound &quot;good&quot; and preferably have pretty much equal amount of<br/>--consonance/dissonance/tension&quot; -Kalle<br/>&nbsp; Again, spot on!&nbsp; And this is for all notes, not just triads.&nbsp; In some ways it&apos;s like a mini-max scale, but it&apos;s not a mini-max scale.&nbsp; It&apos;s similar to one, though, in the common goal of optimizing the lowering of<br/> maximum dissonance rather than lowering average dissonance.</p><p>--&quot;so that no<br/> strong hierarchies of intervals or chords are established.&quot; -Kalle<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly...ironically the ultimate goal is to have a scale system where so many combinations of intervals are &quot;close enough to sounding consonant&quot; that the system eliminates the need for external musical theory to be needed to decide which chords work.&nbsp; Hopefully such a system would make music very accessible to past non-musicians and enable experts to focus more on mood and less on &quot;which chords have the sound I want that also sound consonant&quot;.</p><p>--&quot;This should allow more freedom in combining melodies than traditional diatonic scales allow.&quot; -Kalle<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; And by a very significant margin.&nbsp; Hopefully quadrupling the number of consonant chords (and moods!) possible (even by an unpracticed musician) will not be unrealistic.</p><p>--&quot;This I understand is the primary goal, considerations<br/>---of difference tones, beat rates and use of rational/irrational</p><p>---numbers are secondary concerns.&quot; -Kalle<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly, most of these just serve as potential ways to work around the supposed impossibility of making a 7+ note chord within a period of around 1.618.&nbsp; The basic idea is to organize beating and align &apos;root&apos; tones along the strongest areas of hearing resolution is such a way as to make any inevitable psycho-acoustic &quot;conflict&quot; between overtones sound &quot;fairly pleasant and predictable&quot; rather than virtually eliminating it.&nbsp;</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=82936 href="#82936">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2009 9:37:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, djtrancendance@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --&quot;The period can be an octave or something more exotic like a tritave<br/>&gt; --or phi-tave.&quot;&nbsp; -Kalle<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agreed. :-)&nbsp; A general pattern I&apos;ve noticed with noble-number-<br/>generated scales, for example, is it&apos;s quite often best to use the<br/>noble-number itself as the period (and that using the 2/1 octave as<br/>the period in such cases I&apos;ve found actually causes horrific<br/>dissonance).&nbsp;</p><p>But shouldn&apos;t you get the same intervals no matter which one is the<br/>generator and which one is the period?</p><p>&gt; --&quot;This I understand is the primary goal, considerations<br/>&gt; ---of difference tones, beat rates and use of rational/irrational<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---numbers are secondary concerns.&quot; -Kalle<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly, most of these just serve as potential ways to work<br/>around the supposed impossibility of making a 7+ note chord within a<br/>period of around 1.618.&nbsp;</p><p>But is it okay to suggest scales with octave or tritave periods?</p><p>If it is, then how about looking for carefully selected subsets<br/>higher up the harmonic series?

But I don&apos;t have the foggiest clue how to mathematically determine which denominator would provide the best solution to &quot;fit my scale to the high end of the harmonic series&quot;...if that&apos;s what you are talking about.<br/>&gt; **************************************************************<br/>&gt; Kalle&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I&apos;m talking about expressing scales as harmonic series segments<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; like the JI diatonic can be expressed as 24:27:30:32: 36:40:45:48<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are easily found using the fit/harmonic- command in Scala.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Awesome, I&apos;ll definitely give that a shot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --&quot;If the rational version of your scale is expressed similarly the<br/>&gt; ---first number will be 371280 so you definitely weren&apos;t doing exactly<br/>&gt; ---the same thing. &quot;<br/>&gt;     Apparently not...I was rounding &quot;by ear&quot; to the nearest low-numbered fraction.  And I honestly have no clue how SCALA calculates it&apos;s &quot;stacked ratio&quot; format you described above...but it can&apos;t hurt to try it and see how the result sounds.<br/>&gt; **************************************************************<br/>&gt; Kalle&gt; &quot;Anyway, an example of recurrent sequence is Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Ah, ok, duh, my bad...I&apos;ve obviously heard that before: each number is a function of the last couple of numbers in the same way the number before it is the same function of the<br/>&gt;  numbers before that.  And 21/13 IE 1.615 is stuck is that example...go figure...while the higher fractions merge ever closer to the value of PHI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Anyhow, I was thinking of things in terms of &quot;only ratios&quot; and got sidetracked.<br/>&gt; ********************************************************<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Michael,</p><p>Did you check out the phi samples in Robert Walkers post below?

For example the whole PHI^Y/2^X formula used to make the tuning my scales are based on came from the idea of an exponential version of the &quot;circle/spiral of 5ths&quot; used to generate mean-tone tunings, not from some random document(s) about<br/> PHI!<br/>**************************************************************************************************<br/>Rick&gt; &quot;The maths we musicians are using is not picked at random but encodes thousands &gt;of years of experience and accumulated knowledge.&nbsp; We are having a conversation which you don&apos;t yet understand.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I need to clarify something yet again.&nbsp; I respect JI and the single-toned/tonal nature of the harmonic series.&nbsp; I respect mean-tone and know how it is created. I respect MOS-scales and know how they are created.&nbsp; I respect the idea of using equal temperaments and swapping notes conditionally to purify intervals.&nbsp; I respect the laws of physics concerning critical band roughness and beating.&nbsp; Also, since Carl&apos;s recent posts...I understand why odd-limit and the idea of having each tone in the scale o-tonally related to at least two other tones is important when rating the level of<br/> consonance between low rational-numbered fraction scales...and I no longer confused prime and odd limit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, somehow, despite this and more you dare to say I&apos;m &quot;not yet understanding&quot; any of the dialogue on this list.&nbsp; Admittedly, I don&apos;t understand 100% and, for example, was recently corrected on confusing prime and odd limits.&nbsp; But I do understand exponentially more than someone who has just gone to school in diatonic music theory.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, I will also say...that despite knowing all of the above I choose not to spend my time making JI scales.&nbsp; Yes, I know how to make JI scales (and have displayed scales such as the 12/11 * 11/10 * 10/9 * 9/8 * 12/11 * 11/10 * 10/9 JI tetra-chordal scale in the past)...but I simply think it&apos;s more interesting PERSONALLY to explore less-traveled paths such as noble-number generated scales (I do NOT work on such scales out of disrespect for you or anyone<br/> else more interested in JI-type scales!).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can go on thinking I don&apos;t read any of or give a hoot about JI or anything else on this list, create music for social acceptance rather than personal fascination,&nbsp; and make mistakes mostly b/c I didn&apos;t do said formal schooling you mentioned above...I can&apos;t deprive you of your ignorance...but it does not change the fact my actual behavior by-and-large says otherwise.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Michael&apos;s posts have been for the most part nothing but ad hominem attacks, accusing anyone and everyone of stereotyping, pidgeon holing etc...as if we&apos;re all representative of the stuffy old academy stuck in our ways. And as for techno, I was hired for a techno (house) gig last night. Did the DJ know what he was doing? Yes, because the keyboard player/programmer and myself taught him things like &quot;don&apos;t speed up the record because the pitch increases&quot;...der, or &quot;don&apos;t mix two records in together which are in different keys&quot;. And no, he is a very typical representative.</p><p>&quot;techno is great&quot; is a bit of a broad statement. Most, and I really do mean most, of what I hear sounds like exactly what it is: some guy on a computer  using other peoples samples or programs like reason and covering up mistakes with an over-compressed simulated bass drum and high hat on the off beat. In fact a musician friend of mine actually put this to the test. He &apos;wrote&apos; a whole lot of random tracks on reason, recorded it onto his ipod as a continuous stream, and pretended to play records and mix beats. When it finished he started over again. No one, including the so-called &apos;experts&apos; in techno, knew any different and in fact hired him for a whole lot of gigs. So why go through the bother of using a DJ at all? Why not just write a program to &apos;create&apos; music...and while we&apos;re at it, create another program to &apos;enjoy&apos; the music in our stead. Then we can forget about music altogether and take jobs at microsoft.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So let me be absolutely clear: it takes years and years of practice and<br/>&gt; &gt; study to become a musician or musical scholar, not to mention tens of<br/>&gt; &gt; thousands of dollars.

There&apos;s nothing &quot;high school&quot; about that...people distorting<br/>&gt;  and badly communicating other people&apos;s work is a real issue...in academia, the work place, and beyond.  Charles Lucy, Carl Lumma, and others have also had their share of trouble with people making mis-transcribed versions of their scales and theories...sometimes by accident sometimes not; but even good intentions often don&apos;t help slow the distortion.

This is so FAR out of context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The reason I have that name on my yahoo account is because it&apos;s an old address I&apos;ve for my old musical artist name had since I was about 15<br/>&gt;  (and, for example, changing to a new one would require losing my list of old yahoo contacts).<br/>&gt;    And I figured most people would be able to figure out by how I write, for example, that I&apos;m a 3.8GPA graduate school graduate.  Of course...there&apos;s always going to be the occasional blind-sighted person being a bastard and saying (paraphrased) &quot;haha...your name is djtrancendance&quot; as if I had just created the account.</p><p>Ok fair enough, I apologise. But perhaps if you stopped doing yourself and your education a disservice and refrained from phrases like &quot;blind-sighted person being a bastard&quot; we would eventually figure out that you&apos;re a 3.8GPA graduate school graduate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     You know, if some really wanted to be popular and socially acceptable, they wouldn&apos;t even think of touching micro-tonal music and certainly wouldn&apos;t be playing weird layered abstract-ambient break-beat tracks.  They&apos;d be doing same more simplified hip-hop tracks or commercial rock), sending out flyers everywhere, they&apos;d be contacting DJ&apos;s and labels day and night, trying to get their music in video games, putting their tracks out on I-tunes, getting a degree from Berkeley School of Music to<br/>&gt;  &quot;prove their professional-ity&quot; ...<br/>&gt;     It doesn&apos;t take a genius to figure out...if I&apos;ve made the above &quot;strides toward social acceptance&quot; or not...good luck at finding a paper trail of any attempts to sell music in mass quantities.</p><p>Yes, good point. I suspected that you were some DJ who just logged onto this site to teach us &quot;fogies&quot; a lesson, and got defensive when you found it not so easy. But as I said, you should take some responsibility for this because your insults did help create that (albeit false) impression.<br/>&gt; **************************************************************************************************<br/>&gt; Rick&gt; &quot;Forgive me if I&apos;m wrong, but the fact that your posts, like &quot;techno&quot; itself, lacks any form of silence or self reflection&quot;<br/>&gt;    I think I&apos;ll simply let other people on the forum be the judge as to if you are stereotyping or not...</p><p>Well to this I&apos;ll say that I am not stereotyping anything that has not stereotyped itself into a corner already. I am just describing.<br/>&gt; *************************************************************************************************<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;it takes years and years of practice and study to become a musician or<br/>&gt; musical scholar, &gt;not to mention tens of thousands of dollars.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Haha...wait a minute...a thought you were making the argument about why I was some musician grasping for social acceptability and taking common paths...and here you are telling me I must take the socially acceptable path toward musicianship.  Conflicting suggestions? :-D</p><p>Not at all. Speaking generally (not against you), there is a great deal of difference between a minority of truly creative and individual musicians, many of whom have been alienated by fake marketing, and those in the majority who profit enormously by simulated music and, what&apos;s worse, cover their public sycophantry with simulated rebellion. But by the same token, I think its also important not to over-react against and throw the baby out with the bath water, as I fear many avant-garde &quot;artistes&quot; run the risk of doing. As I&apos;ve said before, even the most basic diatonic music can be still quite fascinating when looked at from, say, a wave theoretical level. In other words, advanced calculus is not a more important branch of mathematics than  arithmetic, just because it is harder to understand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    BTW, there are too many good musicians out there without great degrees to make your statement/assumption about &quot;having to pay to be a  good musician&quot;.  I, for one, have spent hours composing music per day since about the age of 15 practicing hard and have played guitar since the age of 11.  I haven&apos;t considered music school largely because of the great amount of learning I can do by reading lists like this one and informative musical web sites online.  In short...I respect the idea of people&apos;s learning either through formal schooling or intense<br/>&gt;  research on their own time.</p><p>Me too. I&apos;m from Australia where education used to be free provided you had aptitude and talent. But since we adopted (what we call) the &quot;American&quot; system of paying as you go, controversy has arisen as only rich kids can now afford formal education, and they of course are not necessarily bright or talented. The problem is that, by and large, their parents don&apos;t think the arts relevant to the &quot;real world&quot; i.e. their real world which they have created, so uni&apos;s cut art funding and give it all to business, politics and economics. I too have done most of my work without pay. So we&apos;re on the same page there.<br/>&gt; **************************************************************************************************<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;It should go without saying that playing records, using a few computer<br/>&gt; programs or &gt;reading a couple of websites about &quot;Noble medians&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;Phi&quot; reaches anywhere near the &gt;same level of expertise.&quot;<br/>&gt;    You are making random assumptions again.  I never read any websites about PHI minus the links you guys gave me AFTER I created my scale (the definition of PHI and it&apos;s properties was something I remembered from high school).  What I did read before was documents about the Mt Meru scales, methods for creation of MOS scales, methods for creation of mean-tone scales, and tons of documents about critical band (Plomp&amp;Llevelt) and beating (Helmholtz), just to name a few.   I took PHI and tried applying it to such constructs, NOT the other way around (IE trying to force those constructs around PHI). For example the whole PHI^Y/2^X formula used to make the tuning my scales are based on came from the idea of an exponential version of the &quot;circle/spiral of 5ths&quot; used to generate mean-tone tunings, not from some random document(s) about<br/>&gt;  PHI!<br/>&gt; **************************************************************************************************<br/>&gt; Rick&gt; &quot;The maths we musicians are using is not picked at random but encodes thousands &gt;of years of experience and accumulated knowledge.  We are having a conversation which you don&apos;t yet understand.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Maybe I need to clarify something yet again.  I respect JI and the single-toned/tonal nature of the harmonic series.  I respect mean-tone and know how it is created. I respect MOS-scales and know how they are created.  I respect the idea of using equal temperaments and swapping notes conditionally to purify intervals.  I respect the laws of physics concerning critical band roughness and beating.  Also, since Carl&apos;s recent posts...I understand why odd-limit and the idea of having each tone in the scale o-tonally related to at least two other tones is important when rating the level of<br/>&gt;  consonance between low rational-numbered fraction scales...and I no longer confused prime and odd limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Yet, somehow, despite this and more you dare to say I&apos;m &quot;not yet understanding&quot; any of the dialogue on this list.  Admittedly, I don&apos;t understand 100% and, for example, was recently corrected on confusing prime and odd limits.  But I do understand exponentially more than someone who has just gone to school in diatonic music theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Once again, I will also say...that despite knowing all of the above I choose not to spend my time making JI scales.  Yes, I know how to make JI scales (and have displayed scales such as the 12/11 * 11/10 * 10/9 * 9/8 * 12/11 * 11/10 * 10/9 JI tetra-chordal scale in the past)...but I simply think it&apos;s more interesting PERSONALLY to explore less-traveled paths such as noble-number generated scales (I do NOT work on such scales out of disrespect for you or anyone<br/>&gt;  else more interested in JI-type scales!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    So you can go on thinking I don&apos;t read any of or give a hoot about JI or anything else on this list, create music for social acceptance rather than personal fascination,  and make mistakes mostly b/c I didn&apos;t do said formal schooling you mentioned above...I can&apos;t deprive you of your ignorance...but it does not change the fact my actual behavior by-and-large says otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     If any one on this list aside from Rick honestly thinks I&apos;m a guy trying to become famous musician and become &quot;popular&quot; rather than a guy interested in micro-tonal music out of personal fascination...please say &quot;I&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>You see, that made sense.

I suspected that you were some DJ who just logged onto<br/>this site to teach us &quot;fogies&quot; a lesson&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (BTW...haha...there&apos;s no way that would ever happen: I&apos;ve been on here for a couple of years and I certainly didn&apos;t just show up overnight to ignorantly raid this place :-D)</p><p>&nbsp; As for the apology: thank you.&nbsp; :-)</p><p>Rick&gt; &quot;But perhaps if you stopped doing yourself and your education a<br/>disservice and &gt;refrained from phrases like &quot;blind-sighted person being<br/>a bastard&quot; we would eventually &gt;figure out that you&apos;re a 3.8GPA graduate<br/>school graduate.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&apos;t use those phrases often.&nbsp; I don&apos;t consider it &quot;unsophisticated either&quot;; most people who are educated and not push-overs eventually have to exercise harsh forms of self-respect.&nbsp; I didn&apos;t say you were a bastard, I said you were being one as in choosing to be one.&nbsp; If someone asked me to take a dare to steal food for them from the break-room at my office, I would probably say something similar...and with good reason.&nbsp; Again, there&apos;s a huge difference.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW, when you apologized, I took it as &quot;I&apos;m sorry for being such a bastard...I&apos;m usually not like that&quot;.&nbsp; And I can respect that you aren&apos;t...if you can respect that I am not either.<br/>*********************************************************************************************<br/>Rick&gt; &nbsp; &quot;But as I said, you should take some<br/>responsibility for this because your insults did help create that<br/>(albeit false) impression.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&apos;t take credit for that though.&nbsp; I simply posted threads on my new theories...and, believe me, you insulted me as &quot;not understanding a thing&quot; several times before I even reacted the first time.&nbsp; And, no, I don&apos;t think you are a genuinely mean person, but I do still get the impression you think you are helping the quality of the list somehow by bullying me and calling me an &quot;insulter&quot; when I simply won&apos;t take your crap.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I highly suggest we both back off...these little &quot;dog fights&quot; really are not productive, although I feel to some extent I have to participate to make it obvious to you and others...that I am far from a push-over.<br/>*********************************************************************<br/>Rick&gt; &quot;there is a great deal of difference between a minority of truly<br/>creative and individual &gt;musicians, many of whom have been alienated by<br/>fake marketing, and those in the &gt;majority who profit enormously by<br/>simulated music.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Right, and I agree with you...it&apos;s a terrible phenomena.&nbsp; For every new hip-hop record, for example, some public awareness that could catch on to some other great composers (IE Neil Haverstick or Marcus Satellite) is sucked away and many ultimately more innovative composers are left in the dark for almost no one to see.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think its also important not to over-react against and throw the baby<br/>out with the bath &gt;water, as I fear many avant-garde &quot;artistes&quot; run the<br/>risk of doing.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; True, and this is why I &quot;at least&quot; try to focus on 9-or-less note scales with good consonance and adherence to basic critical-band related psycho-acoustics (even if they may not sound much like 12TET)...to at least somewhat maintain accessibility to the public.&nbsp; I stay far away from tunings like 53TET personally b/c I figure most musicians and instrument designers would have a very tricky time using it.&nbsp; I try very hard not to be too &quot;avant-grade&quot;...even if it doesn&apos;t look like it on the surface.</p><p>Rick&gt; &quot;As I&apos;ve said before, even the most basic diatonic music can be still<br/>quite fascinating &gt;when looked at from, say, a wave theoretical level.<br/>In other words, advanced calculus is not &gt;a more important branch of<br/>mathematics than arithmetic, just because it is harder to &gt;understand.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Right...and it IS fascinating.&nbsp; :-) Only it&apos;s so well researched and with so many experts...it makes me think &quot;I&apos;d make very little difference in such a well-researched and perfected field...why not find another one less-perfected where I can make more of a difference&quot;?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; So while on the surface it may look like I &quot;don&apos;t respect&quot; these fields, on the contrary, I respect them to the point I think I have little to add far as making good original JI-type scales that are not like hundreds of scales already created and mastered by the experts.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The problem is that, by and large, their parents don&apos;t think the arts<br/>relevant to the &quot;real &gt;world&quot; i.e. their real world which they have<br/>created, so uni&apos;s cut art funding and give it all to &gt;business, politics<br/>and economics. I too have done most of my work without pay. So we&apos;re &gt;on<br/>the same page there.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly...it&apos;s a real pain.&nbsp; :-D&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My personal perspective is that if people learned to enjoy and improve art (IE compose music/paint/etc.)...they would receive a sense of satisfaction that would make them want to stay at home and learn more music rather than, say, buy huge cars and homes to show them off to their friends.&nbsp; And just feel more fulfilled and happier in general...instead of sweating day and night over Wall-Street.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; As you noted...we&apos;re on the same page here...and I also am doing this as a labor of love knowing well there is a 99% chance I will not get paid a cent for it.&nbsp; Which is fine, minus the part where I need a full-time day job that takes up time I could be learning and discovering more about music.</p><p>Rick&gt; &quot;You see, that made sense. You managed to write 5 paragraphs with only<br/>one self-defensive insult (about diatonic music theory) which I will<br/>take on the chin for the sake of fairness.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks...for the record that &quot;self-defensive insult&quot; was just my way of saying &quot;yes, I do respect JI despite the fact I haven&apos;t worked with it recently&quot;.&nbsp; But I think we&apos;re now both on the same page far as knowing what I actually think of JI and why I (or should I see way) do this &quot;crazy unpaid labor&quot; also known as deriving scales and composing music. :-)</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=83062 href="#83062">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2009 10:31:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick&gt; &quot;But digital technology/human nature being what it is, there are many<br/>more electronic non-musicians who ride on the cred of those hard<br/>working few.

Are x and y whole numbers?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Basically plugging in different values for x and y so the result is between zero and PHI (1.618034) give possible values for PHI scales and my scales are subsets of those.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But, just tonight, I had a revelation that the above formula doesn&apos;t split the 2/1 octave into fractions very well (IE it works ok for finding 1.618034 and 1.30902...but loses accuracy beyond that).&nbsp; It turns out this &quot;PHI mean-tone&quot; type generation is actually fairly inaccurate for certain intervals IE giving 1.208 for one interval tone that should be 1.236 and 1.46808 instead of 1.44957!<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How/why did mean-tone generation fail to meet the mark?&nbsp; If you look at wikipedia&apos;s definition of the golden ratio you&apos;ll notice how each part of the drawing here<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fibonacci_spiral_34.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fibonacci_spiral_34.svg</a> keeps on splitting itself into smaller areas.&nbsp; So the phi^x/2^y mean-tone-type formula doesn&apos;t preserve the relationship very accurately more than a few levels down (the equivalent of smaller and smaller squares in the drawing).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So my new formula became.&nbsp; result = (higher-lower)*(1.618034/2.0)+lower.&nbsp; For example to find the PHI value between 0.618034 (1/PHI) and 1.618034 we get (1.618034-0.618034)*(1.618034/2.0)+0.618034 = 1.236068.&nbsp; And then with 1.618034 and our new value 1.236068 as the lower value we get 1.545078.&nbsp; Keep on mixing and matching these results and splitting in different ways and you can obtain the &quot;REAL&quot; PHI scale:</p><p>1<br/>1.118<br/>1.236068<br/>1.30902<br/>1.4495788<br/>1.54507<br/>1.618034 (period/&quot;PHI-octave)<br/>---------------<br/>1.80896 (1.618034 * 1.118)<br/>2 (1.618034 * 1.236068)<br/>etc.<br/>************************************************<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time around, the scale will perfectly preserve the 2/1 overtone much as JI-does and higher overtones/harmonics will be estimated closely though a bit less accurately as you go up.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most part...you get a purer-sounding version of the PHI^X/2^Y scale which does a much better job of &quot;playing nice&quot; with the harmonic series (definitely a plus) while still preserving the more pleasant (at least to my ears) beating synchronous-ity of PHI mean-tone which had drawn me to it in the first place.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
