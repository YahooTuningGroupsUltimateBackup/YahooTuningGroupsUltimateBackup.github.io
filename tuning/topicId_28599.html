There will be some<br/>*huge* pieces, and many of them.  In fact, many of our most visible<br/>composers will have at least one.</p><p>Other composers, perhaps not needing to make quite as big a &quot;splash&quot;<br/>will be writing their own personal pieces, dealing internally with<br/>the tragedy.</p><p>It is more in this spirit that I need a little help getting some<br/>scales together.</p><p>I need a scale that is expansive, resonant and pretty dissonant.  I<br/>thought at first of possibly a non-octave scale, but really they are<br/>much too difficult to notate, if I decide to include a live<br/>performer...</p><p>Similarly, although I know there are people on this list who feel 19-<br/>tET is easy to notate and learn for specifically &quot;non-xenharmonic&quot;<br/>performers, but I have some doubts there, too.  19-tET might have the<br/>right &quot;sound&quot; for such a project, but I need something even more<br/>practical...</p><p>I have *no* doubts, however, about the feasibility of performers<br/>learning 72-tET...  None whatsoever.</p><p>However, my favorite &quot;blackjack&quot; subset would surely not be right for<br/>such a project.  It is much too &quot;sunny&quot; a scale, much too consonant.</p><p>What I need is the &quot;dark brother&quot; of blackjack... another scale<br/>subset of 72-tET that is everything that blackjack is *not*..... the<br/>opposite pole.  *That* is what would be needed for a suitable WTC<br/>requiem...</p><p>I would say if we could keep it in the range of about 21 notes or<br/>fewer that would work best...</p><p>I know I already had been discussing some of these possibilities with<br/>Paul Erlich and others on this list... some time ago we were<br/>bantering around the idea of a &quot;dissonant&quot; 72-tET scale, but never<br/>came up with anything.</p><p>Now&apos;s the time.  Any suggestions??  This is a dissonant and mournful<br/>time if ever there was one!</p><p>Any help or suggestions would be *greatly* appreciated!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>________ _______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=28600 href="#28600">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/25/2001 9:19:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I need a scale that is expansive, resonant and pretty dissonant.
