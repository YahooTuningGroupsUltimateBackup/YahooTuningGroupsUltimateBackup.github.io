The two types of tonality came later, and<br/>note that minor tonality doesn&apos;t even normally include a minor<br/>second over the tonic!</p><p>Mathematically, the seven interval classes of diatonic music<br/>correspond to the seven equivalence classes that arise from a<br/>kernel of {81:80, 25:24}. Then, treating variations of 25:24 as<br/>large enough to merit their own sub-categories (which they<br/>would in any except the Thai closed-7 system), but ignoring<br/>81:80, gives rise to the &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; designations on<br/>diatonic intervals. Modern major/minor tonality later sprung from<br/>this system, but is in no way required to define it.</p><p>81:80 is either tempered out (the normal case), or in JI, it gives<br/>rise to further terminological distinctions, which become very<br/>confusing and often contadictory between different authors.</p></div><h3><a id=33293 href="#33293">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2002 2:31:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 81:80 is either tempered out (the normal case), or in JI, it gives<br/>&gt; rise to further terminological distinctions, which become very<br/>&gt; confusing and often contadictory between different authors.</p><p>Interesting--what would</p><p>1--10/9--5/4--4/3--3/2--5/3--15/8</p><p>be called by these various authors, I wonder?</p></div><h3><a id=33304 href="#33304">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2002 10:48:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 81:80 is either tempered out (the normal case), or in JI, it<br/>gives<br/>&gt; &gt; rise to further terminological distinctions, which become very<br/>&gt; &gt; confusing and often contadictory between different authors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting--what would<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1--10/9--5/4--4/3--3/2--5/3--15/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; be called by these various authors, I wonder?</p><p>I was talking about terminological distinctions in the naming of<br/>_intervals_.
