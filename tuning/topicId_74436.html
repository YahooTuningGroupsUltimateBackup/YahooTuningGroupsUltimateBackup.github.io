(I&apos;m not referring to Brad&apos;s cent values - just to his<br/>&apos;experimental&apos; results, that seem to lead to a scheme of tuning that<br/>is actually extremely restrictive.)</p><p>But amazingly enough Quantz never actually told his readers what this<br/>special keyboard temperament was (that was required to make sense of<br/>his remarks - at least as Brad interprets them), or how to set it.</p><p>What sort of author would assume a pre-existing, aurally exact notion<br/>of temperament among practically all the German- and French-speaking<br/>harpsichordists of the age?</p><p>The alternative is to accept that Quantz was only writing in<br/>approximate generality, and never meant his list of &apos;difficult&apos; thirds<br/>to be taken with hairsplitting exactitude. That his meaning was<br/>&apos;Whenever you have set a tuning in which there are thirds which are<br/>quite noticeably impure, as these ones often are, you might well leave<br/>them out and let the solo instrument play them purer&apos;. That his<br/>keyboard-playing readers were meant to understand a general principle<br/>of accompaniment - rather than to try and rework their own tuning<br/>procedure, by some very roundabout method, to match the hints<br/>supposedly given in the text.</p><p>If we actually examine Brad&apos;s sample solutions to his self-imposed<br/>Quantz-problem, we find that the thirds F-Ab and Ab-C are in both<br/>cases *less* pure than C-Eb and E-G# respectively. Quantz calls C-Eb<br/>and E-G# problematic - but he *doesn&apos;t* say that F-Ab or G#-B# are<br/>also. How could we ever believe that Quantz was being exact and<br/>comprehensive when he mentioned C-Eb and E-G# as difficult thirds, but<br/>not F-Ab or G#-B#?</p><p>Looking once more at Brad&apos;s intervals (or indeed, at any historically<br/>credible modified meantone), Eb-Gb is also always worse than C-Eb: why<br/>then did Quantz also not mention E-Gb as a difficult third?</p><p>I find Cavallo much more literally credible, when he says that every<br/>harpsichordist tunes slightly differently to favour a slightly<br/>different range of keys. Then the only way to understand Quantz,<br/>without positing a Europe-wide (or even Berlin-wide) conspiracy of<br/>harpsichord tuners, who all somehow produced the same &apos;bad&apos; thirds, is<br/>to forget the dream of being able to deduce exactly what tuning Quantz<br/>was used to hearing by the presence or absence of this or that exact<br/>interval in his list of undesirables.</p><p>What rings out clearly from the text is a simple principle: the desire<br/>for purer intervals than the keyboard could provide.</p><p>Consonant with this is Quantz&apos; insistence on the monochord:</p><p>&quot;The best manner of escape from this ignorance<br/>is the monochord, on which one can clearly learn the<br/>intervals. Every singer and instrumentalist should become<br/>familiar with its use. They would thereby learn to recognize<br/>minor semitones much earlier as well as the fact that notes<br/>marked with a flat must be a comma higher than those with a<br/>sharp in front of them (...)&quot;</p><p>Which intervals will the singer and instrumentalist find on their<br/>monochord? Brad seems to assume that they will find *only* the<br/>1/6-comma tempered intervals, and then strive mightily to sing and<br/>play slightly flat fifths and slightly sharp(flat) major(minor) thirds.</p><p>But actually, the only monochords I know of (whether in theory or<br/>practice) all have the *pure* intervals marked out first and most<br/>prominently. Isn&apos;t it obvious that the intervals that a musician would<br/>most likely learn from a monochord are the pure ones?</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=74441 href="#74441">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2007 3:51:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stringph@gmail.com">stringph@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 22 Kas&iuml;&iquest;&half;m 2007 Per&iuml;&iquest;&half;embe 1:23<br/>Subject: [tuning] History and absurdity</p><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consonant with this is Quantz&apos; insistence on the monochord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The best manner of escape from this ignorance<br/>&gt; is the monochord, on which one can clearly learn the<br/>&gt; intervals.
