Hi Aaron.</p><p>It&apos;s a fine question, and one doesn&apos;t have to be a defender of either,<br/>to find it interesting, or to explain it, since it is a question about<br/>the relation of two mathematical objects and not about the relation of<br/>either of them to the real world.</p><p>I wish I knew the answer. The form of the question that I have been<br/>giving much thought to is:</p><p>Since many HE local maxima are within a few cents of simple noble<br/>intervals, why do simple nobles utterly fail to predict the HE maxima<br/>nearest to the most consonant intervals?</p><p>Aaron, you suggest it may relate to the limit of human hearing and the<br/>overtone series.</p><p>The former seems more likely to me. Both HE and noble mediants take<br/>the overtone series into account in some sense, and both give more<br/>weight to simpler ratios. But HE takes into account human pitch<br/>discrimination, while noble mediants are far too simple for that.</p><p>However, it seems as though noble mediants might be more likely to<br/>agree with HE for very _poor_ pitch discrimination rather than very<br/>good discrimination.</p><p>Thanks Kraig, for the Helmholtz graph, and for emailing me the pages<br/>that describe its derivation. It uses the same kind of calculations as<br/>Sethares&apos; &quot;sensory dissonance&quot; (SD) except that Sethares has the<br/>benefit of Plomp and Levelt&apos;s measurements of the actual shape of the<br/>critical band function, where Helmholtz just used the simplest<br/>plausible one he could think of.</p><p>Harmonic entropy begins from an entirely different basis. This is most<br/>evident in the fact that HE does not take into account the actual<br/>partials of the tones, but assumes &quot;typical harmonic timbres&quot;, and so<br/>it does not stretch with stretched partials for example. With<br/>inharmonic partials HE and SD disagree with each other but I<br/>understand the idea is that both inform the actual experience.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, HE is blind to difference-tone effects, but SD<br/>may accomodate them if they are added as additional partials before<br/>running the model.</p><p>I just noticed that in an earlier message I addressed my remarks to a<br/>mysterious &quot;Karl&quot;.

Of course, some other intervals would likely be<br/>thrown in as well to make it really authentic, like perhaps some<br/>smaller peaks for the just intervals, like one at 7/4 and one at 350<br/>cents. I can already tell you that my pitch discrimination at around<br/>350 cents is much stronger than my pitch discrimination at 550/600<br/>cents, for example -- I sometimes get 550 and 600 cent intervals<br/>confused, especially if they&apos;re at the top of a chord (although<br/>considerably less so recently), but I rarely ever actually confuse 350<br/>for 400 cents.</p><p>It might be interesting to generate a sigma curve and multiply THAT<br/>into the equation rather than keeping sigma constant.

Is that<br/>&gt; what the &quot;N&quot; parameter is for?</p><p>There has sometimes been an assumption that because the<br/>Helmholtz/Plomp/Levelt/Sethares Sensory Dissonance (SD) is purely<br/>derived from the place mechanism, depending as it does on the shape of<br/>its filter response curve (the critical band curve), that therefore<br/>harmonic entropy (HE) must relate purely to the periodicity mechanism.<br/>But Paul doesn&apos;t actually exclude the possibility that both place and<br/>periodicity mechanisms may feed into the neural net that we imagine<br/>harmonic entropy (HE) might be modelling. This may be particularly<br/>relevant to higher frequencies where the periodicity mechanism can&apos;t<br/>keep up.</p><p>The s (sigma) parameter is what describes the accuracy with which<br/>frequency can be measured by the combination of mechanisms. I<br/>understand it is simply the standard error expressed as a percentage<br/>of the frequency.</p><p>&gt; and 2) has any experimentation ever been done on with having the sigma<br/>&gt; value vary across the pitch spectrum?</p><p>I don&apos;t think so, because it has always been given as a function only<br/>of the width of the interval without absolute frequencies. But varying<br/>sigma across the spectrum sounds like a perfectly valid thing to do.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m thinking along the lines of<br/>&gt; having sigma &quot;peaks&quot; at 100, 200, 300 ... up to 1200 cents to simulate<br/>&gt; the harmonic entropy of an average listener who has been mainly<br/>&gt; exposed to 12-tet...</p><p>Interesting idea. I had in mind just making sigma higher towards the<br/>ends of the spectrum.</p><p>&gt; Of course, some other intervals would likely be<br/>&gt; thrown in as well to make it really authentic, like perhaps some<br/>&gt; smaller peaks for the just intervals, like one at 7/4 and one at 350<br/>&gt; cents.

It does not hold up even in the face of my own feeble and limited attempts and demonstrations. If someone wishes to make a sequence of all the say up to 4 note chords possible with the harmonics up to 11 ( with no spaces bigger that an octave)  from predicted consonance to dissonance in order, then we can compare.</p><p>Helmholtz i think is being greatly underrated here. His investigations into  the con/dis factors of chords are NOT based on his graph of dyads, and this is a critical point. Like the great scientist he was, he approached from a different perspective as  foreseeing the very problems inherent at looking at it merely that way. He himself does not believe that the properties of dyads are of much use, otherwise he would approach the problem that way. Whether or not difference tones play a factor, it does support his investigations into the inversions of chords. His examples hold in the limited way they can be applied. At least he is recognizing the breath of the problem. We have only began to explore the continuum and would say we are still in a dark age in understanding even these simplest of things.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Kraig &gt; Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt; &gt; is there somewhere where one can see the Plomp and Levelt&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; measurements or better possibly explain their difference to HH.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15403/1/5544.pdf">http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15403/1/5544.pdf</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15403/1/5544.pdf">http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15403/1/5544.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Helmholtz just said that the maximum dissonance was when<br/>&gt; beats were 33 Hz.
