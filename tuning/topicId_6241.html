His style features more clusters and other textures that<br/> make the tuning seem a more integral feature.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>However, one main idea of Wyschnegradsky&apos;s was the use of microtones in a<br/>kind of diminution technique related to that advocated by Carillo (and<br/>recently, by Stockhausen in _Xi_).  A chromatic passage of seven pitches in<br/>12tet becomes a quartertone passage of 14 pitches in 24tet and an eighth tone<br/>passage with 28 pitches, etc..  Perhaps I understand the word &quot;integral&quot;<br/>somewhat differently to you, but for me, an integral use of a particular<br/>tuning would involve exploring other intervals distinctive to the tuning<br/>(e.g. those relatively prime to the number of tones); the diminution<br/>technique seems rather naive.</p></div><h3>DWolf77309@xx.xxx</h3><span>11/16/1999 2:11:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In einer Nachricht vom 11/16/99 6:21:29 AM (MEZ) Mitteleurop&#xFFFD;ische<br/>Zeitschreibt <a href="mailto:jaywill@utah-inter.net">jaywill@utah-inter.net</a>:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Is there, for example, any serial<br/> compositions using a 24-tone row? &gt;&gt;</p><p>In the original version (1947) and first revision (1951-52), the 2nd and 5th<br/>movements of Pierre Boulez&apos;s _Le Visage Nuptial_ were based on two<br/>interleaved 12-tone series a quartertone apart. At the time of composition,<br/>Boulez was still close to Ivan Wyschnegradsky, participating in one of the<br/>few performance of Wyschnegradsky&apos;s works in 1945 with other musicians from<br/>the Messiaen circle.</p><p>Boulez&apos;s public silence on the subject of Wyschnegradsky is striking. While,<br/>one could readily imagine a Boulezian critique of Wyschnegardsky as a<br/>composer based upon the purely technical criteria, the connection between the<br/>French avant-garde and Skriabin through the &quot;Skriabinistes&quot;, especially<br/>Wyschnegradsky and Obouchow seems obvious.</p><p>In the second revised version (1984-94) of _La Visage Nuptial_, the two seria<br/>were simply merged onto a single 12tet set.  Can this be Boulez&apos;s attempt to<br/>completely erase any debt to Wyschnegradsky?</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
