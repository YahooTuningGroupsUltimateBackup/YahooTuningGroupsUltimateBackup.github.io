<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Useless decimal places</h1><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@idcomm.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2000 7:15:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The point has been made, quite correctly, that when any of us bandy<br/>about tuning values to .0001 cents, that precision is WAY beyond what<br/>the ear can hear.  If I play two notes, one at 440 hz, the other .0001<br/>cents higher (or lower), it&apos;d take them over 5 hours to get out of phase<br/>and another 5 hours to get back in!  Clearly this is way into the realm<br/>of mathematical fantasy as far as the ear goes.</p><p>Still, I am guilty of posting tuning values to .0001 cents.</p><p>I like to see these absurdly precise values because it helps maintain a<br/>consistency check on what my program is doing: when things are supposed<br/>to add up to zero, more decimal places are better.</p><p>Of course, contained in the number 10.0375 cents is also something of<br/>substance.  I hope it&apos;s clear that it&apos;s meant to convey, &quot;somewhere<br/>around 9 to 11 cents&quot;, rather than &quot;.0001 cents more than the incorrect<br/>value of 10.0374 cents&quot;.</p><p>In the end, all this math, overly precise or not, is meant to be in<br/>service of music.  Without lovely musical results, the numbers mean<br/>nothing.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>John van der Hoek &#x3C;JVANDERH@MATHS.ADELAIDE.EDU.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2000 7:30:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Readers,</p><p>There is a possible reason why all these decimals might be useful.<br/>Obviously not for tuning purposes.</p><p>I am interested in tuning in Byzantine musical modes. They are<br/>supposedly different from many western tunings. I am interested to<br/>learn why these tunings sound &grave;natural&apos;.</p><p>It is clear that JI is closely associated with integral divisions<br/>of a vibrating string, whereas ET is not. But if one to use a vibrating<br/>plate (drum) the harmonic structure is quite different from that of a<br/>string. Perhaps scales based on the natural harmonics of a drum could<br/>be interesting.</p><p>In summary if I am given a scale - with intervals specified - it may need<br/>to be given very accurately in order to determine its &grave;natural&apos; origin -<br/>if that exists.
