It was<br/>Starrett who introduced me to this world about 11 years ago, when he<br/>gave me a 19 tone prototype guitar and said to try it out. At that time,<br/>the excitement of playing in another tuning other than 12 eq was a riot,<br/>full of possibilities and exciting new horizons...I didn&apos;t know just<br/>from unjust, or much of anything else. Now, after a few years at it and<br/>associations with a lot of brilliant folks, I&apos;ve acquired a much deeper<br/>intellectual appreciation of the vast world of tunings, but, at the<br/>core, it&apos;s the delight that comes from hearing a piece of music that<br/>sounds unlike anything I&apos;ve ever heard before that is the great thrill<br/>in my musical life...the rest  is icing, but it&apos;s the SOUNDS that<br/>matter...my greatest respect to all in the field, but a great<br/>composition is where it&apos;s at for me...Hstick</p></div>
