Come to think of it, 12-tET makes a weird sort of sense when you look at the amplitude of partials on acoustic instruments, in that the &quot;in-tune-ness&quot; of various notes practically seems correlated to volume of partials!  I mean, the octave is pure, and the 2nd partial is always very strong, the fifth is very close to pure, and the 3rd partial is quite strong, then the major third is not very pure, and the 5th partial is not super-strong.</p><p>So one of the paradoxes is that 3/2 is very periodic and has low Tenney height, so being near it will (in the sense of fundamentals) theoretically sound concordant, but when you look at the 3rd partial of the fundamental vs. the 2nd partial of the fifth, they&apos;ll start to clash pretty heavily as you mistune the fifth, because the interval between THEM will quickly rise in harmonic entropy and/or critical band roughness, and/or decrease in periodicity.  Hence a mistuned fifth smuggles in really HIGH H.E. intervals between partials.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92398 href="#92398">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2010 1:52:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; One can imagine higher-adic harmonic entropy where all the<br/>&gt; partials are input.

I, for example, tried my best to say<br/>that I think critical band should be used more often with dyadic ratios under<br/>around 7/6....implying that I think it should almost always be used in such<br/>cases.  Then I tried giving examples of the (to my ear) flat range (so far as<br/>perceived dissonance) between about 12/11 and 9/8...and Igs said that 9/8 was<br/>significantly better IE no dice.</p><p>   Maybe I should be asking...what degree of examples do I need to provide to<br/>get something around here taken as a theory?   I feel I keep running into a<br/>brick wall when someone asks me &quot;ok, what existing theory are you following&quot;.<br/>In such cases I can&apos;t find &quot;PHD research&quot; to back up things.   Like my ideas of<br/>using clustered triads with consecutive slightly tempered neutral seconds as<br/>chords or using 22/15 as a 5th occasionally and trying to balance/&quot;re-align&quot; the<br/>impure 5th with generally strong dyads.  I&apos;ve given lots of sound examples (both<br/>plans for sound experiments/reproduction and actual sound samples)...but those<br/>don&apos;t seem to be counting much either.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So you think 60% is HE and 40% is beating partials? Work the math out and do<br/>&gt;it! We can use all of the research<br/>that we can get.&quot;</p><p>    I feel in the same boat as you in that, in some cases, my ear will tell me<br/>something that seems to contradict many existing theories and I&apos;ll trust my<br/>ear.   While I can&apos;t give a series that explains the 60/40....looking at the two<br/>curves seems to say the following.  At least to my ear...anything under about<br/>7/6 follows Sethares&apos; curve more closely (+1 point).  Sethares&apos; curve also puts<br/>6/5,5/4, 5/3, and 4/3 (+4 points) at much more similar dissonance levels than<br/>HE...just like my ears do.  So make that 5 points for critical band dissonance.</p><p>     The HE curve shows a high discordance point at around 22/15 and Sethares&apos;<br/>curve shows the area as fairly level....whereas to my ears the point at 22/15 is<br/>much more settled than anything around it....and specifically more settled than<br/>16/11, which looks like a relative low-point on the HE curve.  Plus they both<br/>miss the 11/9 neutral second, the 18/11&apos;s sounding much more consonant to me<br/>than 13/8, the 11/6&apos;s sounding much more consonant than the nearby 20/11...and a<br/>handful of other &quot;neutral interval relative discordance low points&quot;.</p><p>IMVHO, both curves fail there, but HE fails a good bit worse.  Same goes with<br/>the way both systems seem to over-credit 3/2 and give, say, 40/27 a fairly good<br/>rating just because it nears 3/2.  0 points for both theories.</p><p>   Pros for HE: it catches the low point around 436 cents (about 9/7), one at<br/>5/4 (giving a wider low &quot;gravity&quot; range than Sethares&apos; curve), another definite<br/>low around 7/5, another at 8/5, another at 7/4...significantly better than<br/>Sethares.  A point that applies to all 5 of these, I can really sense the<br/>&quot;gravity&quot; toward those points....and something near 5/4, for example, often just<br/>sounds like a bad 5/4 and not a good something else.  For example 24/19 between<br/>5/4 and 9/7...it sounds more like 5/4 than 9/7 because of such gravity.  So make<br/>that 5*1.5 (for the overlying gravity concept and said above cases where I find<br/>it works well) = +7.5 for HE.</p><p>And since 7.5 + 5 = 12.5 and 7.5 / 12 = 60%...there you get your 60% that HE is<br/>better.<br/>    Now so far as what to do productively with the 22/15 and 9/8 12/11 range<br/>that I say both theories miss the mark on...oh man.  My composition for Sevish&apos;s<br/>project uses 18/11, 11/6, 22/15...all over the place and I&apos;ve posted tons of<br/>suggested scales using those intervals.  I&apos;ve also given several examples of<br/>&quot;super diminished&quot; chords I think are passable discordance-wise like stacking a<br/>12/11 * 11/10 into a 6/5.  The usual response is &quot;no it doesn&apos;t...because said<br/>established theory says it doesn&apos;t&quot;...but hey, at least I try.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Put some original research out and I would imagine that you&apos;d find some<br/>&gt;receptive ears on here.&quot;<br/> Again...any suggestions of what I could do to better qualify my efforts as<br/>&quot;original research&quot;?

If you have<br/>a theory for how musical consonance works, it needs to hold in almost<br/>all cases, and the exceptions need to be adequately addressed. If it<br/>seems useful, people will use it. Your ideas about critical band<br/>dissonance in chords seem to be you expressing articulately your own<br/>personal tastes in the construction of harmonies, not a theory for the<br/>foundations of music. But if lots of people are saying they prefer<br/>roughness in chords, and you say that you don&apos;t - isn&apos;t it a bit<br/>simplistic to continue to argue over whether or not roughness is<br/>&quot;bad?&quot; Clearly some people prefer it and some don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel in the same boat as you in that, in some cases, my ear will tell me something that seems to contradict many existing theories and I&apos;ll trust my ear.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I can&apos;t give a series that explains the 60/40....looking at the two curves seems to say the following.&nbsp; At least to my ear...anything under about 7/6 follows Sethares&apos; curve more closely (+1 point).&nbsp; Sethares&apos; curve also puts 6/5,5/4, 5/3, and 4/3 (+4 points) at much more similar dissonance levels than HE...just like my ears do.&nbsp; So make that 5 points for critical band dissonance.<br/>//<br/>&gt; IMVHO, both curves fail there, but HE fails a good bit worse.  Same goes with the way both systems seem to over-credit 3/2 and give, say, 40/27 a fairly good rating just because it nears 3/2.  0 points for both theories.</p><p>Right, but the point that keeps being made here is that these two<br/>dissonance measures aren&apos;t just two mysterious curves that either<br/>match up to or differ with perception. It isn&apos;t like this is politics,<br/>with there being the Erlich and the Sethares party and people figuring<br/>out which cult figure they like more. The two curves have conceptual<br/>(and mathematical) ideas behind them for one to think critically<br/>about. The conceptual idea behind the critical band curve is that<br/>roughness causes dissonance, and everything sort of follows from that.<br/>So the question is - what about if we&apos;re dealing with sine waves? Is<br/>everything equally consonant outside of the critical band range?</p><p>Harmonic entropy and Sethares dissonance simply deal with two<br/>different psychoacoustic phenomena. To take either one as being<br/>responsible for the entire concept of consonance is a bit simplistic -<br/>so why do it? Keep again that a bare major 7th dyad sounds consonant<br/>in a way that isn&apos;t described by either HE or critical band<br/>dissonance.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pros for HE: it catches the low point around 436 cents (about 9/7), one at 5/4 (giving a wider low &quot;gravity&quot; range than Sethares&apos; curve), another definite low around 7/5, another at 8/5, another at 7/4...significantly better than Sethares.&nbsp; A point that applies to all 5 of these, I can really sense the &quot;gravity&quot; toward those points....and something near 5/4, for example, often just sounds like a bad 5/4 and not a good something else.&nbsp; For example 24/19 between 5/4 and 9/7...it sounds more like 5/4 than 9/7 because of such gravity.&nbsp; So make that 5*1.5 (for the overlying gravity concept and said above cases where I find it works well) = +7.5 for HE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And since 7.5 + 5 = 12.5 and 7.5 / 12 = 60%...there you get your 60% that HE is better.</p><p>Right, so what you&apos;re doing is trying to come up with an overall<br/>&quot;pleasantness&quot; concept that factors in how much the interval is<br/>tempered and how much the partials beat, for harmonic timbres. There&apos;s<br/>nothing wrong with that. I don&apos;t see the rigor in your approach by<br/>assigning arbitrary numbers as &quot;points&quot; and then using those as the<br/>basis for a mathematical calculation, but you are free to do whatever<br/>you wish and if you find the end result useful, use it.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now so far as what to do productively with the 22/15 and 9/8 12/11 range that I say both theories miss the mark on...oh man.&nbsp; My composition for Sevish&apos;s project uses 18/11, 11/6, 22/15...all over the place and I&apos;ve posted tons of suggested scales using those intervals.&nbsp; I&apos;ve also given several examples of &quot;super diminished&quot; chords I think are passable discordance-wise like stacking a 12/11 * 11/10 into a 6/5.&nbsp; The usual response is &quot;no it doesn&apos;t...because said established theory says it doesn&apos;t&quot;...but hey, at least I try.</p><p>I have always thought your scales sound great. I don&apos;t think I<br/>understand exactly why you think they sound great. I do agree that<br/>there is some kind of &quot;sweet spot&quot; around the neutral second, and I<br/>don&apos;t know why exactly that is. I suspect it has something to do with<br/>roughness.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Put some original research out and I would imagine that you&apos;d find some receptive ears on here.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;Again...any suggestions of what I could do to better qualify my efforts as &quot;original research&quot;?&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m all ears... :-)</p><p>I responded to this offlist with a longwinded rant.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92427 href="#92427">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2010 11:31:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;Right, you have said that. And I have repeatedly thrown in counter<br/>examples in which chords are used that have intervals smaller than<br/>7/6, and they sound great.&quot;<br/>  Perhaps there&apos;s been some lack of clarity on my part. :-(  I was saying that<br/>the critical band dissonance curve of Sethares gives what I see as more accurate<br/>estimates IE it seems to shoot up in dissonance much more starting at about<br/>13/12 (and anything below that has a much lower incremental penalty for<br/>increased closeness)...whereas HE seems to say there is more or less a linear<br/>increase in dissonance starting at around 7/6 (boo...thanks to my ears...I don&apos;t<br/>believe that for a second). :-D</p><p>   If you really think I&apos;m against intervals less than 7/6...look at my<br/>composition for Sevish&apos;s album, look at almost any of my latest scales<br/>(including the Infinity-series scales) which as chalk full of 12/11 intervals or<br/>scales I favor ala Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales, chords I&apos;ve recommended,<br/>suggestions I gave to Jon (suggestion he allow 10/9 if not also 11/10 and 12/10<br/>to be counted as chord-usable dyads in his consonance calculator...)    And<br/>check how many times I&apos;ve used the keywords &quot;neutral second&quot; in my messages on<br/>this list in a positive light....it could easily be hundreds of times!</p><p>    I&apos;m about the largest SUPPORTER of using consecutive small intervals as you<br/>will find....minus the kind of people who stack consecutive near 16/15 (or<br/>closer!) dyads and call the result a stable chord.</p><p>&gt;&quot;you insist that intervals less than that are unusable.&quot;<br/>   Erm...not at all.   I&apos;d say intervals less than 12/11 are fairly unusable in<br/>chords.  That is unless...they are separated by larger intervals to compensate<br/>for their dissonance IE D E F in 12TET seems OK because the D is about 9/8 from<br/>the E, which helps make up for the terrible critical band dissonance of the<br/>E-&gt;F.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Your ideas about critical band dissonance in chords seem to be you expressing<br/>&gt;articulately your own<br/>personal tastes in the construction of harmonies, not a theory for the<br/>foundations of music.&quot;<br/>    And now that I&apos;ve clarified where I think the limits of chord density are<br/>(more like 12/11, certainly not at 7/6!)...would you still say that?</p><p>&gt;&quot;But if lots of people are saying they prefer roughness in chords, and you say<br/>&gt;that you don&apos;t&quot;<br/>   Well, some people prefer Sethares &quot;roughness based&quot;, some don&apos;t.  So wouldn&apos;t<br/>that idealogy you seem to be charging against my ideas with throw his ideas out<br/>the window as well?</p><p>&gt;&quot;isn&apos;t it a bit simplistic to continue to argue over whether or not roughness is<br/>&gt;&quot;bad?&quot; Clearly some people prefer it and some don&apos;t.&quot;<br/>   Argh.   I know a few professional musicians.  I&apos;ve played them micro-tonal<br/>chords and asked them to pick out what sounds bad to them.  Without fail, they<br/>jumped at consecutive 12TET semi-tone-like intervals...a couple even jumped at<br/>my precious consecutive minor second chords (though much less so).  Some even<br/>found, by ear, tail ends of melodies (not very sustained) that combined with<br/>each other to form high critical band dissonance tones I didn&apos;t even know were<br/>in my compositions.  Listeners...same deal...only their ears didn&apos;t pick up<br/>things like neighboring tone conflicts so accurately.  Is it all-encompassing?<br/>No.  Does it appear to apply/work more than half the time far as people I&apos;ve<br/>tested it on?  You bet!</p><p>&gt;&quot;Right, but the point that keeps being made here is that these two dissonance<br/>&gt;measures aren&apos;t just two mysterious curves that either match up to or differ<br/>&gt;with perception. &quot;<br/>  Meaning...there&apos;s a mathematical principle behind each one?  If so, yes, I get<br/>that.  But then again Sethares was based on Plomp and Llevelt...and their curve<br/>was derived by a series of tests involving two sine waves over many people just<br/>asking &quot;how dissonant is this?&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Right, so what you&apos;re doing is trying to come up with an overall &quot;pleasantness&quot;<br/>&gt;concept that factors in how much the interval is tempered and how much the<br/>&gt;partials beat, for harmonic timbres.&quot;<br/>     I just don&apos;t see how that&apos;s any more &quot;random&quot; than what Plomp and Levelt<br/>did...specifically if I can find enough listeners to give evidence to back it up<br/>(as they did).   Otherwise...it seems the only path to a &quot;justified theory&quot; is<br/>to make every single little thing fit into one hulking formula that assigns<br/>exact values to everything...is that really what&apos;s required?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I have always thought your scales sound great. I don&apos;t think I understand<br/>&gt;exactly why you think they sound great.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;I do agree that there is some kind of &quot;sweet spot&quot; around the neutral second&quot;<br/>   Mysteriously...yes...although perhaps more of a sweet range than a sweet<br/>spot. :-)<br/>   It seems the feel and &quot;usability&quot; between 12/11 and 9/8 is indeed locked...to<br/>the point the root tone beating becomes significant enough that periodicity<br/>doesn&apos;t matter as much...this adds to the fact most everything is within 7 cents<br/>of everything else in that range anyhow.  Try 23/21 vs. 11/10...hard to tell a<br/>difference despite the 23/21 being higher limit.  My point...(consistently)<br/>under about 9/8 periodicity becomes &quot;blurred&quot;...which means the distinguishing<br/>factor left is critical band.  And, even with pure sine waves, the critical band<br/>under 12/11 seems to be more than the ear can handle.</p><p>&gt;&quot;and I don&apos;t know why exactly that is. I suspect it has something to do with<br/>&gt;roughness.&quot;<br/>   Right...or a least I&apos;m trying to &quot;play a game&quot; of getting as many neutral<br/>seconds as possible to create new kinds of clustered chords without destroying<br/>the accuracy of more common ratios (IE the low-limit ones HE points out).  I am<br/>using the apparent fact that range sounds &quot;blurred&quot; to round with arbitrary<br/>precision between 12/11 and 9/8 to help preserve those larger ratios (IE the<br/>ratios where periodicity quite often takes precedence).   Also the latest scales<br/>I&apos;ve made capture all possible dyads within a 2 octave range to a list of<br/>desirable dyads (mostly trying to form 7-limit or less allowing a few of the<br/>more relaxed sounding 11-limits as needed) within 8 cents...IE the whole<br/>&quot;maxi-min&quot; idealism from 1/4 comma mean-tone definitely seems to help.</p><p>   Some things I can&apos;t quite explain yet...like how I&apos;ve found sour areas near<br/>16/13 and 20/11 and 16/11 and 13/8....and yet sweet areas around 22/15 and 13/9<br/>and 18/11 (which look on the surface to be just as bad as fractions).   Finding<br/>a unified theory to explain those will take a while...all I can say for now is<br/>those appear to be some very nearby bad-next-to-good ranges and the musicians<br/>I&apos;ve blind tested those dyads on seem to agree a large majority of the time so<br/>far.</p></div><h3><a id=92429 href="#92429">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2010 11:57:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt; There is no PhD research, because there are no PhD&apos;s here.</p><p>Haha, I&apos;m getting messaged offlist because of this line.

Really I&apos;d want to find a way to put on a &quot;0 to 100&quot; scale the same way I did with H.E.; that&apos;s the only way I can *really* compare them.</p><p>&gt; 2. Vos-curve harmonic entropy should ameliorate the problem<br/>&gt; somewhat.  Have a look at:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/secor4.gif">/tuning/files/dyadic/secor4.gif</a></p><p>Dag nabbit, how many H.E. curves are there??  Every time I come up with an issue with one, you pop up with another version that looks a lot better.  But still, I think I will find the same issues with clashing partials.  Even on that version, it looks like a rather far-off 3/2 will still beat a good 6/5.  Not by as much as in the exponential version that I&apos;ve been using, but still.</p><p>Mike mentioned an octave-equivalent version of H.E.  I&apos;m curious how that works, because I frankly am starting to have issues with Tenney Height.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s measuring the same thing I want to measure, because I have a hard time hearing 12/5 as being half as &quot;restful&quot; as 6/5, or hearing 5/2 as twice as &quot;restful&quot; as 5/4.  You once described concordance to me as &quot;instantaneously producing a feeling of restfulness&quot; or something, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s quite what Tenney Height is measuring.  It just boggles me that some intervals go up geometrically in Tenney Height as you increase the octave, while others drop geometrically.  That just doesn&apos;t fit with my experience of concordance.  It also totally blows chunks all over the &quot;critical bandwidth&quot; theory, right?  So I&apos;m wondering if the octave-equivalent formulation of H.E. solves that somehow.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Perhaps I should give up on the idea that different EDOs<br/>&gt; &gt; can be quantitatively compared along a single dimension,<br/>&gt; &gt; or that it&apos;s even worthwhile to quantify qualitative<br/>&gt; &gt; properties of sound?  Maybe I can get the point across<br/>&gt; &gt; about what each EDO is and isn&apos;t good for just by words.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you see this message:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_92350.html#92361">/tuning/topicId_92350.html#92361</a></p><p>Yes, I thought I replied to it too, but I guess Yahoo ate my response.  Just FYI, the &quot;re-scaling&quot; I used was the one suggested by S.J. Martin in another response on that thread, basically the same as the exponential but adjusted to be 0-100, with 100 being &quot;lowest H.E.&quot; and 0 being highest.</p><p>As to the list of 7-limit triads, my reckoning is that 31-EDO would dominate all the triads that include 5, and 36-EDO would dominate all the ones that don&apos;t.  But I&apos;ve been thinking about higher odd-limits as well, as a way to incorporate triads formed by combinations of 7-limit dyads.  Not necessarily to rank or quantify EDOs, but to help guide people into finding useful chords.  I do feel that it&apos;s helpful, for instance, to know that in 23-EDO, the chord formed by degrees 0-4-9 is within a 7-cent error of 16:18:21.  I mean, 16:18:21 may not be a great chord, but for tunings like 23-EDO, it&apos;s one of the better chords going (there&apos;s also a pretty good 5:6:7 chord, also, but we all know how I feel about that chord vs. 16:18:21).</p><p>I dunno, there are so many different possibilities as to how I can approach this, but they all have their issues and inconsistencies.  At least if I leave JI and concordance out of it, and just stick to subjective impressions, I won&apos;t have to add caveats every chapter of &quot;the numbers say this, but my experience says otherwise&quot;.  I&apos;ve yet to see a formulation of anything that doesn&apos;t run afoul of my experience in some place or another.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92482 href="#92482">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2010 10:29:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>2010/9/8 genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ...What constant claims?

And I don&apos;t<br/>know how it works, but it clearly works somehow, and that in that<br/>sense I find a major 7 chord really consonant, whether the thirds are<br/>intoned 5/4 or 9/7.</p><p>Is that not fair?</p><p>&gt; Just because something is used in jazz theory does not make it a universal law; I react to that the way you do to claims about how thing &quot;should&quot; work based on 18th and 19th century classical music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the bottom line is, 11/6 has nothing to do with jazz theory, so trying to analyze it in that way makes no more sense than trying to analyze it in terms of Mozart&apos;s style would.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that maj7 chords have anything to do with jazz theory<br/>either. I think they have to do with an expanded approach to meantone<br/>that started around the beginning of the 21st century. And I think<br/>that for me to say that they&apos;re consonant in the sense that I perceive<br/>how they fit into this very beautiful complex structure (which is an<br/>superset of the same structure that leads to common practice harmony)<br/>is similar to me saying that I see a dalmatian in this picture:</p><p><a href="http://www.mindmaptutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/emergence.jpg">http://www.mindmaptutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/emergence.jpg</a></p><p>Is it not worth admitting that?</p><p>&gt;&gt; If you&apos;re talking about consonance as in how much an interval fuses<br/>&gt;&gt; into a single note, that&apos;s rooted in psychoacoustics, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; think that really translates directly over to pleasantness, especially<br/>&gt;&gt; when placed in the context of a chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think &quot;pleasantness&quot; is too subjective to use as a basis for theory, but am ready to be proven wrong. I suspect one problem is that it is more subject to cultural bias arising from previous exposure.</p><p>Then I think that &quot;consonance&quot; is too subjective to reduce to a single<br/>psychoacoustic percept. And I also think that harmonic concordance is<br/>too far removed from consonance to use as a basis for theory, as<br/>people can get used to mavila and hear all sorts of consonances in it.</p><p>My current obsession is to try and find some kind of pattern in how<br/>this type of consonance works. It has something to do, I think, with<br/>Rothenberg&apos;s idea that people build up mental reference frames or maps<br/>from scales that they&apos;ve learned. The subjective component to this<br/>would come from what maps people have learned so far and which one<br/>they haven&apos;t, so if we assume people have &quot;learned&quot; how to place<br/>things in a diatonic/5+2 sense, we can make predictions on what they&apos;d<br/>find &quot;consonant.&quot; I also think that Paul had some more of the puzzle<br/>figured out with his 22 paper, and maybe some other author I haven&apos;t<br/>read yet has it all figured out. But either way there is still some<br/>type of consonance emerging from &quot;that,&quot; and that&apos;s what I&apos;d love to<br/>have figured out.

Vos-curve harmonic entropy should ameliorate the problem<br/>&gt; &gt; somewhat.  Have a look at:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/">/tuning/files/dyadic/</a><br/>&gt; &gt; secor4.gif<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dag nabbit, how many H.E. curves are there??</p><p>Paul did a lot of work with deep and experienced listeners<br/>like George Secor, Margo Shulter, and many many others as he<br/>was experimenting with harmonic entropy.<br/>The Vos curve version is based on the work of Joos Vos, who<br/>did experiments in which listeners rated the purity of<br/>mistuned intervals.  I don&apos;t have the paper that Paul had<br/>so I can&apos;t comment further, but I believe Vos found that<br/>purity ratings obeyed an exponential distribution<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution</a><br/>around just ratios.  (Please note that this is NOT the same<br/>as taking the exponential of entropy at the end, as you&apos;ve<br/>been doing.)<br/>Regular h.e. uses a Gaussian distribution instead, which is<br/>the most natural assumption and the one used by Goldstein in<br/>his famous &apos;central pitch processor&apos; model.<br/>Those are the two principle versions.  Beyond that, it&apos;s<br/>mainly how much noise you want to assume (the variable &quot;s&quot;)<br/>and whether you want to take the exponential when you&apos;re<br/>done.  Goldstein deduced that s was about 1%, but Paul tried<br/>values between 0.6% and 1.2%.  Making it smaller causes more<br/>local minima to appear.<br/>Taking the exponential at the end is perfectly OK since it<br/>doesn&apos;t change the ranking of intervals.</p><p>&gt; Mike mentioned an octave-equivalent version of H.E.  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; curious how that works,</p><p>I think Paul just averaged the entropy of every pair of<br/>inversions.  Like 16/15 and 15/8 would always be the same.<br/>So generally it will lead to worse results.  It&apos;s only<br/>useful if you insist on using octave equivalence in your<br/>music theory.</p><p>&gt; I have a hard time hearing 12/5 as being half as &quot;restful&quot;<br/>&gt; as 6/5, or hearing 5/2 as twice as &quot;restful&quot; as 5/4.</p><p>In both cases it&apos;s not twice, but root twice.  I definitely<br/>hear 5/2 as sweeter than 5/4.  I was dubious about 6/5 vs<br/>12/5 but you know, I just tried it in Scala in two different<br/>octaves and I have to say, to my surprise 6/5 sounds more<br/>concordant.</p><p>&gt; It just boggles me that some intervals go up geometrically<br/>&gt; in Tenney Height as you increase the octave, while others<br/>&gt; drop geometrically.  That just doesn&apos;t fit with my experience<br/>&gt; of concordance.</p><p>To make 5/2 in a harmonic series, you use lower harmonics<br/>than to make 5/4.

I said that I think there are multiple<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic percepts that are often lumped together under the<br/>&gt; &quot;consonance&quot; moniker:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) How much the partials of a sonority clash with one another<br/>&gt; 2) How much they fuse into a single note<br/>&gt; 3) How &quot;pleasant&quot; something ends up sounding without regard to any<br/>&gt; specific psychoacoustic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also threw out that there seems to be some other basis for<br/>&gt; consonance that has to do with internalized maps, so that someone with<br/>&gt; an internalized map for expanded diatonic hearing or whatever you&apos;d<br/>&gt; like to call it will hear a major 7 chord as consonant. And I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know how it works, but it clearly works somehow, and that in that<br/>&gt; sense I find a major 7 chord really consonant, whether the thirds are<br/>&gt; intoned 5/4 or 9/7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is that not fair?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just because something is used in jazz theory does not make it a universal law; I react to that the way you do to claims about how thing &quot;should&quot; work based on 18th and 19th century classical music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And the bottom line is, 11/6 has nothing to do with jazz theory, so trying to analyze it in that way makes no more sense than trying to analyze it in terms of Mozart&apos;s style would.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think that maj7 chords have anything to do with jazz theory<br/>&gt; either. I think they have to do with an expanded approach to meantone<br/>&gt; that started around the beginning of the 21st century. And I think<br/>&gt; that for me to say that they&apos;re consonant in the sense that I perceive<br/>&gt; how they fit into this very beautiful complex structure (which is an<br/>&gt; superset of the same structure that leads to common practice harmony)<br/>&gt; is similar to me saying that I see a dalmatian in this picture:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mindmaptutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/emergence.jpg">http://www.mindmaptutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/emergence.jpg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it not worth admitting that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you&apos;re talking about consonance as in how much an interval fuses<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; into a single note, that&apos;s rooted in psychoacoustics, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; think that really translates directly over to pleasantness, especially<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; when placed in the context of a chord.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think &quot;pleasantness&quot; is too subjective to use as a basis for theory, but am ready to be proven wrong. I suspect one problem is that it is more subject to cultural bias arising from previous exposure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I think that &quot;consonance&quot; is too subjective to reduce to a single<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic percept. And I also think that harmonic concordance is<br/>&gt; too far removed from consonance to use as a basis for theory, as<br/>&gt; people can get used to mavila and hear all sorts of consonances in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My current obsession is to try and find some kind of pattern in how<br/>&gt; this type of consonance works. It has something to do, I think, with<br/>&gt; Rothenberg&apos;s idea that people build up mental reference frames or maps<br/>&gt; from scales that they&apos;ve learned. The subjective component to this<br/>&gt; would come from what maps people have learned so far and which one<br/>&gt; they haven&apos;t, so if we assume people have &quot;learned&quot; how to place<br/>&gt; things in a diatonic/5+2 sense, we can make predictions on what they&apos;d<br/>&gt; find &quot;consonant.&quot; I also think that Paul had some more of the puzzle<br/>&gt; figured out with his 22 paper, and maybe some other author I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; read yet has it all figured out. But either way there is still some<br/>&gt; type of consonance emerging from &quot;that,&quot; and that&apos;s what I&apos;d love to<br/>&gt; have figured out.

They are all &gt; red herrings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to understand Western harmony and jazz you need to use &gt; a meantone-type model<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here follows the solution:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A theory for the ranking of consonance and dissonance between &gt; simultaneously sounding notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assumptions:<br/>&gt; a) Notes played simultaneously, which are closer on the spiral of &gt; fourths and fifths, regardless of ocatve, tend to sound more &gt; consonant, than those which are seperated by a greater number of &gt; steps of fourths and fifths.<br/>&gt; b) An &quot;Index of Dissonance&quot; may be calculated by adding the number &gt; of steps between each note and every other simultaneously sounding &gt; note, and dividing the result by the number of intervals which have &gt; been used in the addition.<br/>&gt; c) All notes are LucyTuned; i.e. meantone intervals (5 Large + 2 &gt; small per octave (ratio 2))<br/>&gt; d) Large interval = 1200 cents/(2*pi) = 190.9858 cents or ratio of &gt; 1.116633.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Method:<br/>&gt; a) List the notes to be considered.<br/>&gt; b) Count the number of steps of fourths or fifths for each pair of &gt; notes to be played simulanteously.<br/>&gt; c) Add the resulting steps for each pair.<br/>&gt; d) Divide the resulting sum by the number of pairs considered.<br/>&gt; e) The Index of Dissonance will be constant regardless of key or &gt; notenames, and may be considered as an index of dissonance for a &gt; type of chord or for a scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Examples:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Using the spiral pattern from fourths to fifths of Bbb-Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-&gt; Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#-B# for first 22 notes.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

And I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; know how it works, but it clearly works somehow, and that in that<br/>&gt;&gt; sense I find a major 7 chord really consonant, whether the thirds are<br/>&gt;&gt; intoned 5/4 or 9/7.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Is that not fair?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Just because something is used in jazz theory does not make it a &gt;&gt; universal law; I react to that the way you do to claims about how &gt;&gt; thing &quot;should&quot; work based on 18th and 19th century classical music.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; And the bottom line is, 11/6 has nothing to do with jazz theory, &gt;&gt; so trying to analyze it in that way makes no more sense than &gt;&gt; trying to analyze it in terms of Mozart&apos;s style would.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think that maj7 chords have anything to do with jazz theory<br/>&gt;&gt; either. I think they have to do with an expanded approach to meantone<br/>&gt;&gt; that started around the beginning of the 21st century. And I think<br/>&gt;&gt; that for me to say that they&apos;re consonant in the sense that I &gt;&gt; perceive<br/>&gt;&gt; how they fit into this very beautiful complex structure (which is an<br/>&gt;&gt; superset of the same structure that leads to common practice harmony)<br/>&gt;&gt; is similar to me saying that I see a dalmatian in this picture:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mindmaptutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/emergence.jpg">http://www.mindmaptutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/emergence.jpg</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Is it not worth admitting that?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you&apos;re talking about consonance as in how much an interval &gt;&gt; fuses<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; into a single note, that&apos;s rooted in psychoacoustics, and I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; think that really translates directly over to pleasantness, &gt;&gt; especially<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; when placed in the context of a chord.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I think &quot;pleasantness&quot; is too subjective to use as a basis for &gt;&gt; theory, but am ready to be proven wrong. I suspect one problem is &gt;&gt; that it is more subject to cultural bias arising from previous &gt;&gt; exposure.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Then I think that &quot;consonance&quot; is too subjective to reduce to a &gt;&gt; single<br/>&gt;&gt; psychoacoustic percept. And I also think that harmonic concordance is<br/>&gt;&gt; too far removed from consonance to use as a basis for theory, as<br/>&gt;&gt; people can get used to mavila and hear all sorts of consonances in &gt;&gt; it.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My current obsession is to try and find some kind of pattern in how<br/>&gt;&gt; this type of consonance works. It has something to do, I think, with<br/>&gt;&gt; Rothenberg&apos;s idea that people build up mental reference frames or &gt;&gt; maps<br/>&gt;&gt; from scales that they&apos;ve learned. The subjective component to this<br/>&gt;&gt; would come from what maps people have learned so far and which one<br/>&gt;&gt; they haven&apos;t, so if we assume people have &quot;learned&quot; how to place<br/>&gt;&gt; things in a diatonic/5+2 sense, we can make predictions on what &gt;&gt; they&apos;d<br/>&gt;&gt; find &quot;consonant.&quot; I also think that Paul had some more of the puzzle<br/>&gt;&gt; figured out with his 22 paper, and maybe some other author I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; read yet has it all figured out. But either way there is still some<br/>&gt;&gt; type of consonance emerging from &quot;that,&quot; and that&apos;s what I&apos;d love to<br/>&gt;&gt; have figured out. And what&apos;s wrong with that?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy<br/>&gt; lucy@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For more information on LucyTuning go to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world) can found at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=92493 href="#92493">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2010 7:13:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&gt;     But what about things like explaining the consonance (to many people,</p><p>&gt;&gt; apparently NOT just me) of 15/8 vs. the lower limit nearby 9/5 and 11/6 or<br/>&gt;&quot;Not to me.

I have much more grandiose ideas in my head, anyway.  But right now, I am occupied by the task of writing this Primer, and I find your theory guidance utterly indispensable.  The sooner I get this theory stuff figured out, the sooner the writing will be done, and the sooner I can get back to making music.  I&apos;ve been promising Ron Sword that I&apos;d bump out some more xenharmonic metal soon, but I&apos;m kind of more on a psychedelic kick.

Ultimately, the whole purpose of my writing on harmonic properties of EDOs is to reveal effective ways to use them.  For instance, I don&apos;t see 13-EDO as a bad tuning, I see it as a bad tuning if you want 4:5:6 chords.  If you want 8:11:13 chords, it looks pretty good!  I know 11- and 13-limit intervals rank low on concordance, but having played a Catler 12-tone Ultra Plus, I can vouch that they can be essentially beatless if they&apos;re well in-tune, which to me marks them as useful.  So let&apos;s ignore the issue of octave equivalence for now and assume that there is something to a fit to the harmonic series--it may not be an absolute guide to concordance, but in a given EDO where options are limited, it seems to be the case that the chords that fit lowest in the series sound the strongest.</p><p>So: let&apos;s suppose we want to look at n-limit triads and how they are approximated in various EDOs up to 37.  Now, let&apos;s assume that our motivation here is not to rank EDOs, but to demonstrate their strongest harmonic possibilities, so our &quot;badness&quot; measure will be on a triad-by-triad basis.  What I believe we need to decide is 1) what counts as an approximation, and 2) what our limit is.  These two questions are obviously interrelated.  Let&apos;s presume we&apos;re sticking with odd limit rather than prime limit, for simplicity&apos;s sake.</p><p>Now, if we set our odd limit at a low number, like 7, we can be sure that any low-error approximation will definitely sound concordant, but we will have very few triadic possibilities; and unless we set a wide margin of error, many EDOs won&apos;t be able to be said to approximate any of them, so it won&apos;t be a good &quot;guide&quot;.  If we set our odd limit too high, we might end up with one tempered chord approximating multiple ratios if our error threshold is not tight enough.  For instance, at an odd limit of 23, the 12-tET minor triad can be said to approximate both 10:12:15 with a high error, and 16:19:24 with a low error; I predict it will be hard for people to interpret what exactly that means (even I find it rather confusing).</p><p>So, uh, what&apos;s the best way to go about this?

If you follow the discussion, you&apos;ll see that the curve was tweaked to conform as nearly as possible with some listening tests I made using a retuned electronic organ in the early 1960&apos;s to determine points of maximum consonance (which correspond to simple-number ratios) and also of maximum dissonance (which was admittedly rather subjective, but better than blind guessing) between neighboring consonant intervals.</p><p>Paul also supplied me with the raw data for each cent from 0 to 1200 cents in the above curve; which will allow you to compare the entropy value for one interval (rounded to the nearest cent) to another.

You<br/>want to reward approximate chords both for their low error<br/>and for the concordance they&apos;d have with zero error.</p><p>First, you create a list of candidate triads, say, of<br/>product limit &lt; 1000.

It doesn&apos;t seem to relate<br/>&gt; to the &gt;&gt; text.</p><p>The point is that 15:8 doesn&apos;t remind me of it in a vague personal<br/>way. It wasn&apos;t like when I was a kid, they played 15:8 and maj7 chords<br/>together and hit me with a 2x4 if until I associated the two. It&apos;s<br/>that there is a cognitive reason why they are connected, and it isn&apos;t<br/>specific to me, but anyone who has an internalized diatonic template,<br/>and have learned through exposure how maj7 chords can be used within<br/>that framework as consonances.</p><p>And the cognitive reason is that, for whatever reason, if you<br/>eliminate the fifth in most diatonic tetrads, the sound of the chord<br/>stays mostly &quot;the same.&quot; Maybe this has to do with Rothenberg&apos;s idea<br/>of minimal sets, maybe because the fifth is an interval giving<br/>relatively less diatonic information, I dunno. But it works and has<br/>been used for a long time.</p><p>So if you have a maj7 chord, the bare minimum that you need to make it<br/>sound like a maj7 chord is C-E-B. This could also be an aug^7 chord,<br/>but you&apos;re probably not going to assume the presence of an aug5 unless<br/>it&apos;s being hinted at.</p><p>A shell voicing is like an ultra-bare minimum voicing of 2 notes that<br/>still roughly implies that chord. And when you play C-B on a piano, it<br/>still sort of sounds like a major 7 chord. And it still retains some<br/>of the same musical consonance that a maj7 chord does, for anyone who<br/>has that map. This type of consonance will also pop up if the dyad<br/>fits anywhere within the maj7 range (e.g. 27/14 will still work) and<br/>probably has something to do with Rothenberg equivalence classes,<br/>although I haven&apos;t worked it out.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Does it? The two are only marginally distinct. Neither<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratio is particularly tunable by ear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can get them both in the ballpark by ear pretty well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How do you know?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>On my 31-tet nylon guitar, I was having trouble tuning major thirds<br/>precisely just because the timbre wasn&apos;t bright enough to give me<br/>enough beating unless I was really far out.

Here&apos;s what I know how to do:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Find the best chord for each ET<br/>&gt; Find the best ET for each chord<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which path do you choose?</p><p>I believe &apos;tis the latter.</p><p>The question is what do you mean &quot;each chord&quot;?  Suppose we define the list of chords to evaluate as, &quot;all the chords in some odd-limit.&quot;  Let&apos;s call that odd limit &quot;n&quot;.  I don&apos;t know the value of n right now.</p><p>What I suspect is that there is some value for n wherein *any* given EDO from 5 to 37 can be found to give the lowest badness for at least ONE n-limit triad, or at the very least CLOSE to the lowest badness of any EDO in the range.  I want to know what this n-limit is.</p><p>I have sort of a hunch that the value of &quot;n&quot; might be somewhere around 21 or 23.  That covers a lot of triads, anyway, and would be a good starting-place.  (Oh, but let&apos;s also assume that our triads span less than an octave--that&apos;ll cut down on &quot;repeats&quot; and octave-doublings, since we have pure octaves in all tunings).  The goal is to have the lowest limit possible such each EDO gives the lowest (or near-lowest) badness for at least ONE triad in the n-limit, so if all EDOs give the lowest badness for MORE THAN 1 triad, the limit may be too high.   Maybe it&apos;s only 19 or 17?  I have no idea.  This is why I&apos;m coming to you.</p><p>Does this make sense, or am I still failing to articulate myself?

I figure more variables and consonance results to manage<br/>could likely mean if there&apos;s a problem I have less chance of trimming it down to<br/>one variable and fixing it quickly.</p></div><h3><a id=92684 href="#92684">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2010 12:45:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;     I saw e^(-3.5x)-e^(-5.75x) in his paper (x is the difference<br/>&gt; in frequencies of the two sine waves involved).
