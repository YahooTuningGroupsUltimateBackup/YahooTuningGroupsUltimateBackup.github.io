In addition to fine compositions by<br/>Bill Alves, Brian McLaren, and others, a nice 22-tET piece of mine was<br/>on it. That piece would be a perfect candidate for John deLaubenfels&apos;<br/>dynamic retuning algorithm. I&apos;d like to make the piece more widely<br/>available -- it seems that Peter Blasser has created just the thing to<br/>make that possible. Peter, can you help me get started?</p></div>
