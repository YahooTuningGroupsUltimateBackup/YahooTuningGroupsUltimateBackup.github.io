All of these would seem, to a novice,<br/>to be very foreign and unexpected things if you&apos;re coming off from<br/>meantone, but they&apos;re all rooted in the same basic thing, which is<br/>that 250/243 vanishes. Well, and some mysterious categorical thing<br/>which we don&apos;t know, but you have to start somewhere.</p><p>It would be really helpful to make a table with all of these<br/>relationships, but it&apos;s a bit hard to define what &quot;all of these<br/>relationships&quot; really is. Does anyone see any ways to lay this sort of<br/>thing out? I guess the goal is to find instances when a^m &ap; b^n, for a<br/>and b which are useful to know about, and when m and n are small.<br/>However, brute forcing from a huge list of 5-limit intervals would<br/>take quite a while.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
