I think notation could be practically<br/>*anything* as Monzo himself attests and people can learn it.  The<br/>important part, though, is that it&apos;s easily readable and<br/>distinguishable to a sight reader in a performance situation.</p><p>HEWM is, Sims is (even though performers still complain about it),<br/>the Reinhard cents notation is, but Sagittal is *NOT*...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;like how the commas work, and too little consideration for making<br/>&gt; &gt;the *most commonly used* microtonal accidentals *very*<br/>distinguisable<br/>&gt; &gt;from one another...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, we got that.  It means one of three things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) Dave and George didn&apos;t do an optimal job of making 600 symbols<br/>&gt; that look very different from one another.</p><p>***Well, what if they were to have taken it from the standpoint of<br/>making the *most commonly used* symbols differentiated the greatest<br/>from one another, and then filled in the options after that.</p><p>Could there be a &quot;foolish consistency&quot; in this notation??</p><p>To cite further:  George gave a graphic on Tuning Math (yes, I was<br/>sneaking undercover...for good reason... over there) and he showed<br/>two versions, the *purest* version of Sagittal and the version that<br/>used traditional accidentals with Sagittal.</p><p>The &quot;pure&quot; version was, of course, impossible to read, and<br/>the &quot;traditional&quot; was better, partially, of course, because musicians<br/>are accustomed to traditional accidentals (I guess I&apos;m mostly<br/>speaking for myself here... :)</p><p>But, here is another example where &quot;theoretical purity&quot; has *nothing*<br/>to do with *legibility...*  In fact there was an *inverse*<br/>relationship!!!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) There&apos;s no way to do it; we have to give up the idea of a master<br/>&gt; list and use the same accidentals to mean different commas in<br/>&gt; different tunings.</p><p>***How about multiple meanings for the *least* used accidentals...<br/>So the *most used* would be greatly differentiated, and the *least*<br/>used could even be *duplicated...*</p><p>Put that on a calculus curve (just being funny) and fill in all the<br/>points between those two concepts...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) We keep the master list, but reduce the number of different<br/>&gt; accidentals needed in a score by using the appropriate number of<br/>&gt; nominals.<br/>&gt;<br/>***I think that could also be confusing, if &quot;decimal&quot; is any<br/>indication....</p><p>JP</p></div>
