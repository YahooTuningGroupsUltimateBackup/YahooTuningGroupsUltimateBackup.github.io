Thanks heaps<br/>for that 7-limit plus neutral thirds lattice.</p><p>The fact that the blackjack scale can be seen as three 7-tone neutral third<br/>MOS should be very useful melodically. In its tetrachordal mode the n3 MOS<br/>goes mLmLmLm, where m is 150c and L is 200c.</p><p>Dan, because some 11-limit intervals are made up of a huge number of<br/>generators (e.g. 22 for 5:11) then these scales are very sensitive to the<br/>precise size of generator for keeping the errors in acceptable bounds. The<br/>31-EDO and 41-EDO sizes of this generator are really the smallest and<br/>largest acceptable. 116.1c and 117.1c. So so 51 and 52-EDO won&apos;t do, and<br/>51, 52 and 103 are not 11-limit consistent. 113-EDO is ok but I think<br/>72-EDO is better.<br/>-------------------------</p><p>Here&apos;s a table showing, for all 13 generators, the denominators of<br/>convergents and semi-convergents can be read in two ways. The low numbers<br/>(say below 31) can be read as the numbers of tones required to acheive<br/>Myhill&apos;s property, MOS, only two step sizes. The larger numbers (say 22 and<br/>above) can be read as numbers of tones in EDOs that contain an<br/>approximation to the generator.</p><p>In both cases the numbers in parenthesis (the semi-convergents) should be<br/>considered second-class citizens. As MOS cardinalities they will give<br/>improper scales (or maybe merely proper, not strictly proper). As EDO<br/>cardinalities they will give poor approximations of the generator.</p><p>Notice that 31 is by far the most popular denominator, occurring in 9 out<br/>of the 13 cases.</p><p>Gener-  Hexad  RMS   MA   Denominators of convergents and<br/>ator    width  err   err  (semi-convergents) of the generator<br/>(cents) (gens) (cents)    as a fraction of an octave (&lt; 100)<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> 78.1   21     5.2   8.5  15,(16),31,46,(77)<br/> 87.7   20     6.3  10.1  13,14,(27),41,(55,96)<br/>116.7   22     2.3   3.4  10,(11,21),31,41,72<br/>154.5   22     7.3  10.5  7,8,(15,23),31,(39,70)<br/>232.1   20     7.9  10.8  5,(6,11,16,21),26,31,(39,70)<br/>271.3   17     6.6   9.3  4,(5),9,(13),22,31,(53,84)<br/>321.8   21     6.3   8.9  3,4,(7),11,15,(26),41,(56,97)<br/>348.3   20     8.4  10.8  3,(4),7,(10,17,24),31,(38,69)<br/>380.7   20     5.6   8.7  3,(4,7,10,13,16),19,22,41,(63)<br/>387.3   20     6.0   9.5  3,(4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28),31,(34,65,96)<br/>495.6   21     6.6   8.6  5,(7),12,17,(29),46,(63)<br/>503.0   18     7.9  11.2  5,7,12,(19),31,(43,74)<br/>580.3   22     6.2  10.4  2,(3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27),<br/>                          29,31,(60),91</p><p>Here&apos;s the list of 11-limit consistent EDOs and the number of times they<br/>occur above.

It happens to be a way of defining 41-equal in the<br/>11-limit using a schisma and three unison vectors it shares with 31-<br/>and 72-equal.  This is the first time I&apos;ve seen three 11-limit scales<br/>tied up consistently to a linear approximation.  I know Dave<br/>understands this (and you can read off some other families from one of<br/>his charts) but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s been explained in full.</p><p>These are all 10+1 scales, in that they are made up of 10 large and 1<br/>small intervals.  I&apos;ll call these s and q respectively because they<br/>are almost but not exactly entirely unlike a &quot;semitone&quot; and<br/>&quot;quartertone&quot;.</p><p>In 31=, s=3 steps and q=1 step.  In 41=, s=4 and q=1.  In 72=, s=7 and<br/>q=2.</p><p>The interval s stands for 16:15 or 15:14, and q stands for 45:44,<br/>55:54, 49:48, 56:55, 64:63 and it looks like even 100:99.</p><p>In the way I outline somewhere on my website, here&apos;s a definition of<br/>the temperament:</p><p>        (10 1)<br/> H   =  (16 1)(s)<br/>        (23 3)(q)<br/>        (28 3)<br/>        (35 2)</p><p>Using this matrix relationship, you can approximate any 11-prime limit<br/>interval in terms of s and q.  If that&apos;s not intuitive enough, here&apos;s<br/>an outline of the temperament.  I&apos;ll talk of identity instead of<br/>approximation for simplicity.  Remember that just intervals are only<br/>approximated.</p><p>The 3-limit is defined by 6s being a perfect fifth (3:2).  Knowing s<br/>represents 16:15 gives you the 5-limit, but it&apos;s simpler to see that<br/>6s =&gt; 8:5.  Again, s =&gt; 15:14 is enough for the 7-limit, but it<br/>happens that 2s =&gt; 8:7 and 5s =&gt; 7:5.  The 11-limit comes from 3s =&gt;<br/>11:9.</p><p>A 5:4 major third is 3s+q, and a 6:5 minor third is 3s-q.  Hence q<br/>stands for two kinds of 11-limit dieses.  Also, 2q =&gt; 25:24.</p><p>A 9:8 tone is 2s-q, and a 10:9 minor tone is s+2q.  That gives a<br/>syntonic comma of s-3q.  The difference between 9:8 and 8:7 also gives<br/>the q =&gt; 64:63.</p><p>The 7:6 subminor third is 2s+q, giving q as the 49:48 comma with 8:7.</p><p>As 11:9 is 3s and 9:8 is 2s-q, that leaves 11:8 as 5s-q.  11:10 is<br/>2s-2q and 12:ll is s+q.</p><p>If you were designing an 11-limit notation from scratch, this would be<br/>the place to start.  You set your ten nominals, and allow for<br/>accidentals of q relative to them.  You could even use the same ideas<br/>for notating Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic scales, as it&apos;s 10 nominals<br/>again.</p><p>As I mentioned before, a 7-limit/neutral-third lattice already implies<br/>two of the three common unison vectors.  So you could already use that<br/>as a generalized keyboard, or use a 10+1 layout for more intuitive<br/>melody.</p><p>And, once you&apos;ve set all this up, you don&apos;t need to use the the best<br/>11-limit scales.  There are borderline meantones that have value, I&apos;m<br/>sure the same will be true of these scales if you look at them closely<br/>enough.</p><p>I think this part of the graph for the 21-note subset is common to the<br/>whole family.</p><p>                                                C-----Ev<br/>                                               / \<br/>                                              /   \<br/>                                          D^----F#----A^<br/>                                         / \/  / \  \/<br/>                                        /  /\ /   \ /\<br/>                              Db----Fv-/--Ab-/--Cv-\--Eb<br/>                             / \   / \/  / \/ \/  / \/<br/>                            /   \ /  /\ /  /\ /\ /  /\<br/>                  C-----Ev----G-----Bv----D-----F^----A<br/>                 / \   / \/  / \/ \/  / \/  / \   /<br/>                /   \ /  /\ /  /\ /\ /  /\ /   \ /<br/>            D^-/--F#-\--A^-/--C#-\--E^-/--G#----B^<br/>           / \/  / \/ \/  / \/  / \   /<br/>          /  /\ /  /\ /\ /  /\ /   \ /<br/>Db----Fv----Ab----Cv----Eb----Gv----Bb<br/> \   / \/  / \/ \/ \/ \/  /<br/>  \ /  /\ /  /\ /\ /\ /\ /<br/>G--\--Bv-/--D--\--F^-/--A<br/> \/ \/  / \/  / \   /<br/> /\ /\ /  /\ /   \ /<br/>C#----E^----G#----B^<br/>  / \   /<br/> /   \ /<br/>Gv----Bb</p><p>With suitable definition of &quot;v&quot; and &quot;^&quot;, you could add the comma<br/>shifts to make it work with 41 and 72=.

Can we then get a 10-note 7/72 oct MOS as well, using some<br/>&gt; black notes. I guess not.</p><p>Sure, you can start with neutral thirds on the white notes, and you&apos;ll<br/>end up with a neutral third scale.  The semitone-generated 10 note MOS<br/>would only have 3 or 4 notes in each chain of neutral thirds.</p><p>&gt; &gt; where #==^^ looks better than M.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand the above sentence.
