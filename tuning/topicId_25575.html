No overloads, very few<br/>&gt; &gt; holes.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the reason for this is the fact that MIRACLE is so<br/>&gt; special<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for generating 11-limit harmony (no generators give the hexad<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fewer notes with as much accuracy, or with as many notes with<br/>&gt; &gt; greater<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; accuracy, right?)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;, and Partch&apos;s scale is rich in 11-limit harmony.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;d be hesitant in drawing any further implications along these<br/>&gt; &gt; lines.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fair enough. But to be unconsciously drawn to Miracle (at least in<br/>&gt; his<br/>&gt; &gt; early years) it suggests he was making use of many harmonies that<br/>&gt; were<br/>&gt; &gt; only approximately JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve heard of this before, through Wilson.</p><p>Aha!</p><p>&gt; &gt; I remember being puzzled by this attitude in Carl Lumma at one<br/>time<br/>&gt; &gt; too. To charicature it: &quot;It&apos;s ok to use chords that contain errors<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; an entire 224:225 or 384:385, but to distribute the errors so they<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; less than 3.4 cents, oh no, that would be tempering&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Well, I guess some people prefer to have most of the chords just and<br/>&gt; then have a few wolves, rather than having all the chords near-just.</p><p>Yes. But when the errors we&apos;re talking about are the same as typical<br/>acoustic instrument intonation errors? And there&apos;s a whole world of<br/>&quot;well&quot; temepraments and planar temperaments before you go to linear<br/>ones.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you should write a paper for Xenharmonikon!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You mean one based on the previous post, showing the Miracle<br/>&gt; keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; mappings, or what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and about MIRACLE in general.

The diamond overloads schismic-41.</p><p>This looks exactly like what Wilson himself suggested in D&apos;alessandro:<br/>Like A Hurricane.  You start with a keyboard to play an ET with some<br/>duplicates either end of the keyboard, to give you a choice about<br/>transposition.  Then you switch to JI, but tune those duplicate keys<br/>differently to get more notes.</p><p>Apply this technique to a 45 key Miracle keyboard, and you can either get<br/>41-equal with duplicates or a superset of Partch&apos;s earlier 43 note scale.<br/> OTOH, the schismic mapping Wilson used in Xenharmonikon needs a split<br/>key for 11:10 and 10:9.</p><p>So now we can see that page 6 of &lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF</a>&gt;<br/>shows Wilson using a Miracle-like mapping to cover Partch&apos;s scale in<br/>exactly this fashion.  There are also no gaps in the 41-note subset, so<br/>this is a better match, if it is a consistent temperament.</p><p>I say &quot;Miracle-like&quot; because it seems to be a solution to the problem of<br/>fitting Miracle to a hexagonal keyboard.

In other words, if some notes can be out of<br/>their logical place with regard to the JI mapping ... Then I could do<br/>the same thing with Partch&apos;s latest 43 on Miracle, and only require 45<br/>keys for that too. i.e. put 81/80 where 49/40 was in the early scale,<br/>and put 27/20 where 15/11 was (I won&apos;t bother writing &quot;and<br/>correspondingly for their inversions&quot; any more).</p><p>                                                         20/11  64/33<br/>   x    10/9   32/27  14/11  27/20  16/11  14/9    5/3   16/9   40/21<br/> 81/80  12/11   7/6    5/4    4/3   10/7   32/21  18/11   7/4   15/8<br/>  1/1   16/15   8/7   11/9   21/16   7/5    3/2    8/5   12/7   11/6<br/>160/81  21/20   9/8    6/5    9/7   11/8   40/27  11/7   27/16   9/5<br/>   y    33/32  11/10</p><p>If desired, one could fill the two holes marked x and y with copies of<br/>33/32 and 64/33 respectively.</p><p>In other words I&apos;m doing Miracle modulo 41 with a twist. Like Wilsons<br/>(p6) mapping, strict Miracle modulo 41 would cause 11/10 to have to<br/>share with 10/9. It would also move 33/32 to the hole that might be<br/>considered to be for 28/27. But instead of doing like Wilson&apos;s p6<br/>mapping and just putting 11/10 in the nearest available position, I do<br/>like his p7 mapping and put it where it should be for a non-mod-41<br/>mapping. In Wilson&apos;s case this puts 11/10 way out in the boondocks,<br/>extending the mapping to 63 notes (20 holes). In the Miracle case it<br/>only extends it to 45 notes (2 holes).</p><p>The above Miracle-45 keyboard mapping gives the same keyboard pattern<br/>for all of the diamond hexads.</p><p>Wilson&apos;s mappings either break up the diamond (p6) or require too many<br/>keys (p7). Miracle-45 doesn&apos;t break up the diamond and doesn&apos;t have<br/>too many keys, but it does have non-standard patterns for<br/>strictly-just chords involving the non-diamond notes 81/80 and 27/20<br/>(and their inverses).</p><p>So it&apos;s a question of what&apos;s more important for a Partch keyboard<br/>mapping to regularise, the diamond, or the chains of just fifths?</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=25687 href="#25687">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 4:20:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ok.

Arrgh! Why are we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; talking past each other here?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, so how do you make a 2D keyboard mappping for a 3D (e.g. 5-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or 4D (e.g. 7-limit) or 5D (e.g. 11-limit) JI scale, that has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (a) pitch monotonically increasing from left to right,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (b) constant patterns for all (strict) JI chords,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (c) no pitches appear on more than one key,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; _without_ it corresponding to some linear temperament? A single<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; example would be fine.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Wilson&apos;s mappings don&apos;t always satisfy all these criteria; therefore<br/>&gt; &gt; it would be wrong to say that each of his mappings implies a fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; linear temperament (which was my only point). Wilson&apos;s creations are<br/>&gt; &gt; based on deep principles which you and I probably know very little<br/>&gt; &gt; about. Not to say we can&apos;t just proceed on our own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ooh. What a lovely cop-out! :-)</p><p>Actually, you took me in. The logical flaw is that, while some of Wilson&apos;s mappings may<br/>correspond to linear temperaments, that in no way implies that the properties of those<br/>temperaments are relevant when applied back to the mapping. The implication only flows in<br/>one direction, since the abstraction in terms of a linear temperament does not necessarily capture<br/>the logic of what Wilson did.</p><p>Also, a 41-CS mapping onto hexagonal keys will imply at least 20 different generators!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you agree that one can&apos;t satisfy (a), (b) and (c) above on a 2D<br/>&gt; keyboard without it corresponding to a particular linear temperamant?</p><p>Actually, it seems to me now that in some cases, many different linear temperaments will be<br/>implied . . .</p></div><h3><a id=25894 href="#25894">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2001 6:29:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Actually, you took me in.
