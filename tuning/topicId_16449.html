In its simplest 12tET form it writes patterns using + for up and - for down followed by the number of halftones and wiggly brackets for looping the pattern. I have also developed diatonic versions for working within nominated scales and a hybrid diatonic / chromatic version. The code could easily be changed into machine language. Among its advantages are that it uses a fraction of the space, it is good for all transpositions/keys, and you can keep making up new ones that aren&apos;t in Slonimsky. When you add wildcards you can write practically all possible musical patterns on one page! - I  guess.</p><p>&gt; ** Original Subject: RE: [tuning] Slonimsky in Westwood in the 90&apos;s<br/>&gt; ** Original Sender: Charles Lucy &lt;<a href="mailto:LUCY@ILHAWAII.NET">LUCY@ILHAWAII.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; ** Original Date: 11 Dec 2000 20:23:55 -0000</p><p>&gt; ** Original Message follows...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; About ten years ago, I was staying with Steve Hammond (my favorite<br/>&gt; musical mentor)in LA, when he was asked by MacMillan publishers to go<br/>&gt; and meet Slonimski, with the idea of producing a new electronic version<br/>&gt; of his book of scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steve went to meet him at his place in Westwood, and I heard that it was<br/>&gt; to progress.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I asked Steve how old Slominski was, and was told &quot;...in his eighties&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately Steve never completed the project as he himself died (in<br/>&gt; his forties) in the meantime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone know what happened to this project?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~====================================================~<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a><br/>&gt; see <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a> for info. on LucyTuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
