And it might also be<br/>worth making a distinction between utonal and otonal chords -- as we&apos;ve<br/>heard Joseph Pehrson attest, 4:5:6:7 is far more clearly the &quot;target&quot; tuning<br/>for a dominant seventh than 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 is for a half-diminished<br/>seventh.</p><p>&gt;Some 20th century pieces (12 tone row, for<br/>&gt;example) would seem to be intimately wedded to 12-tET, to my thinking.</p><p>Absolutely!</p><p>&gt;I guess it comes back to the difference in our perception of the 7-limit<br/>&gt;dom 7th: I feel that its sense of needing resolution is strengthened<br/>&gt;by its tuning, you feel that the sense is weakened (again, correct me if<br/>&gt;I am misrepresenting you!).</p><p>Right -- and more importantly, the retune motions induced by targeting a<br/>4:5:6:7 chord are absolutely musically unjustified, to my ears -- I&apos;d rather<br/>let melodic factors determine the tuning of the dominant seventh, as well as<br/>what are known as &quot;linear&quot; chords in tonal music.</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s a thought: in distinguishing between consonance and concordance,<br/>&gt;you used the example of a perfect fourth being dissonant under some<br/>&gt;circumstances (and I do agree that a chord in second inversion is not<br/>&gt;stable; it pulls toward V in root position).  If a perfect fourth can be<br/>&gt;dissonant and concordant at the same time, then surely the much more<br/>&gt;complex 4:5:6:7 chord can as well!  And the ear can hear it just as<br/>&gt;strongly as needing resolution.</p><p>Again, I think it goes back to the scale and melodic considerations. There<br/>have been a few cases pointed out on this list where, in the context of a<br/>Western tonal progression, a fourth tuned 27:20 within a triad or larger<br/>chord was not perceived as all that disturbing, when that tuning came out by<br/>holding the pitches of the notes constant across neighboring chords. But I<br/>wouldn&apos;t really want to include effects like this in the model -- I&apos;d keep<br/>octave-equivalence for convenience.</p><p>A more relevant example, I think, has been provided by Margo Schulter in<br/>discussing Gothic music. The thirds and sixths in this music are dissonant<br/>and resolve to 3-limit consonances. It is more appropriate, both melodically<br/>and harmonically, to use Pythagorean tuning for these dissonant thirds and<br/>sixths. 5-limit consonances are a very foreign, inappropriate sonority for<br/>Gothic music. Similarly for 7-limit consonances in Baroque and Classical<br/>music.</p><p>If one had to tune a dominant seventh chord in a piece of Baroque or<br/>Classical music without any melodic considerations to guide one, the only<br/>possibility would be to tune it as a just minor third stacked on top of a<br/>major triad. If you had to incorporate a &quot;fall-back&quot; of this kind, I<br/>wouldn&apos;t be unhappy about it.</p><p>&gt;Also, to harken back to your point that the type of music being played<br/>&gt;alters the meaning of the word consonance (major triads are dissonant<br/>&gt;in old music, seventh chords are consonant in the Blues).  This point<br/>&gt;can be taken to strengthen the argument for using 4:5:6:7 dom 7ths for<br/>&gt;a wide range of music for which the context already establishes that a<br/>&gt;7th chord needs to resolve (however it is tuned).</p><p>That sounds like a cop-out to me . . .</p></div><h3><a id=12841 href="#12841">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2000 7:06:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

Section I, 11, entitled:  &quot;No Overtone<br/>beyond the Fifth in the Series Has Any Application to Our Tonal<br/>System.&quot;</p><p>SCHENKER:</p><p>&quot;In reality, the artistic relation between the overtone series and<br/>our tonal system is as follows: The human ear can follow Nature as<br/>manifested to us in the overtone series only up to the major third as<br/>the ultimate limit; in other words, up to that overtone which results<br/>from the fifth division.  This means that those overtones resulting<br/>from higher subdivisions are too complicated to be perceived by our<br/>ear, except in those cases, wehre the number of divisions is a<br/>composite which can be reduced to a number rempresenting the lowest,<br/>perceivable, order of division by two, three or five.  Thus six can<br/>be recognized as two time three or three times two; nine as three<br/>times three; ten as five times two, etc., wheras the overtones 7, 11,<br/>13, 14, etc., remain totally extraneous to our ear.&quot;  ...</p><p>Now, of course, Schenker was somewhat of a crank... and his ideas<br/>about the &quot;naturalness&quot; or &quot;perceivability&quot; of higher partials have<br/>surely been discounted... certainly in our more modern music, but his<br/>system was designated to encompass &quot;common practice perios&quot; music...<br/>i.e. Baroque, Classical and Romantic, of which he was very<br/>familiar...<br/>He probably is pretty much right about the 5 limit there...

I believe Paul Erlich has made several references along the way<br/>in the list over the last year or so, about how the factor of<br/>resolution is MUCH MORE clearly tied to 12-tET than to the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>dominant seventh 4:5:6:7.  Doesn&apos;t it have a lot to do with the<br/>tritone dissonance in 12-tET and the resultant &quot;leading tone&quot; to the<br/>tonic... or am I remembering something wrong (???)</p><p>_________ ____ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
