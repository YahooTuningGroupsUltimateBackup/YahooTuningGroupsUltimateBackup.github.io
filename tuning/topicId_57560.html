(At least until it gets out!)</p><p>The &quot;fair use&quot; on this list is simply for the &quot;educational&quot; component<br/>of it, and the fact that the New Music Connoisseur will probably not<br/>publish the review until several months from now.</p><p>Here it is:</p><p>Three CDs from Johnny Reinhard&apos;s  American Festival of Microtonal<br/>Music: &quot;Chamber,&quot; &quot;Odysseus&quot; and &quot;Early&quot; on the &quot;Pitch&quot; (AFMM) label.</p><p>After almost 25 years of producing and recording concerts, Johnny<br/>Reinhard, the intrepid impresario of the American Festival of<br/>Microtonal Music is releasing CDs of highlights of these many years.<br/>Projected is a series of 13 CDs, and this first release contains<br/>three, &quot;Chamber,&quot; &quot;Odysseus&quot; and &quot;Early.&quot;  All three CDs are<br/>currently available on the internet at <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com">www.cdbaby.com</a>.</p><p>&quot;Odysseus&quot; is an improvised composition, 45 minutes in length, by<br/>Johnny Reinhard.  He tells the classical myth of Odysseus by<br/>assigning various instruments to the roles of animals and gods and<br/>enacts parts of the classic story.  He uses lots of  microtonality in<br/>this work, since he also assigns different tunings to the players. A<br/>fun CD, I imagine the effect would be even greater by watching the<br/>video, also available through the AFMM.</p><p>&quot;Early&quot; is a CD featuring primarily the music of J.S. Bach tuned in<br/>the intonation prevalent at the time, Werckmeister III.  It&apos;s an<br/>ambitious project to render two complete Brandenburg concertos (#2<br/>and #5) in an &quot;alternate&quot; tuning other than our &quot;normal&quot; 12-equal and<br/>Reinhard should receive accolades for the splendid musicianship on<br/>this disk.  He has some of the best New York players around, and the<br/>performing is very solid.  Unfortunately, it was more difficult for<br/>me to actually hear the difference between Werckmeister and our<br/>standard 12-equal temperament.  I could hear the unusual intonation<br/>in the recorder part, played by Reinhard himself, but it was less<br/>evidenced to my ear in the other instruments.</p><p>In any case, it is the &quot;Chamber&quot; CD on which I would like to focus,<br/>since I feel this CD is one of the most interesting discs of<br/>contemporary music around. It starts off with a bang, Preludio a<br/>Colon by Julian Carillo, featuring soprano Meredith Borden.  In this<br/>piece, one of his most famous, he blends moods of mystery and<br/>anticipation.  I&apos;ve always felt that Carillo really brings out the<br/>microtonal aspects of his work.  Some find his methods too obvious,<br/>but I find them compelling.  At least one can frequently hear the<br/>scales with which he is working.  There are &quot;16th tones&quot; and<br/>quartertones in this piece.  The violin parts, played by Dan Auerbach<br/>and Tina Cho echo the sliding, microtonal singing by Meredith<br/>Borden.  Carillo creates a compelling, atmospheric world, and a hard<br/>act to follow.</p><p>The CD continues bravely with Lou Harrison&apos;s, At the Tomb of Charles<br/>Ives.   This is a large, but short, chamber piece played in &quot;just<br/>intonation&quot; or an intonation of only unbeating, pure, intervals.  As<br/>in several of the AFMM ensemble efforts, I find the just intonation<br/>hard to hear, except in the expert playing of Chris Washburne on<br/>trombone who is very obviously hitting the true, just intervals<br/>against the accompaniment.</p><p>We have reached the midpoint of this AFMM &quot;Chamber&quot; CD.  Reinhard<br/>has, deliberately, placed some of the more conceptionally challenging<br/>pieces here.  Ko-Lho by Giacinto Scelsi, the reclusive Italian<br/>nobleman, consists of long instrumental phrases that intertwine<br/>between the flute, performed here by Andrew Bolotowsky and the<br/>clarinet of Michiyo Suzuki.  The microtonal playing with these<br/>instrumentalists using quartertones, is very audible.</p><p>In another twist of expert programming, Reinhard then goes from the<br/>very sparse meditative Scelsi to the high complexity of Iannis<br/>Xenakis&apos; Anaktoria, scored for eight instruments with Reinhard<br/>conducting.  I hear an unusual interpretation of Xenakis from<br/>Reinhard.  During solo passages, he makes the instruments come out<br/>with animal-like sounds and personalities.  This lends lots of<br/>character and certainly a slightly different interpretation.</p><p>Next is a pretty &quot;thorny&quot; work, Charles Ives&apos; String Quartet #2.  Its<br/>inclusion on the microtonal festival has to do with the particular<br/>tuning coached for this piece: Pythagorean, or tuning evoking the<br/>open, pure fifths on the string instruments as, supposedly, suggested<br/>by Ives himself.  I found the difference between this tuning and<br/>the &quot;conventional&quot; renditions of this piece a little hard to hear.<br/>On the other hand, there were some problematic aspects which were<br/>very easy to hear, such as the playing of violin virtuoso Tom Chiu<br/>not blending in with the other instruments of the &quot;Flux&quot; quartet.<br/>Chiu is one of the most brilliant new music soloists of this day.  Is<br/>he, though, really an ensemble player?  It sounded to me as more a<br/>concerto for violin with three other accompanying strings who just<br/>happened to be there.  Hopefully, it was just the mic-ing.  I was<br/>also not fond of Chiu&apos;s interpretation of the final very high violin<br/>section.  He played it with a kind of screeching intensity and I have<br/>heard it played more with an atmospheric transcendence which I<br/>personally feel would be more to the Ives spirit.</p><p>The CD ends on a lighter note, as it should.  Believe me, there is no<br/>one, who can organize a concert or CD as well as Reinhard can.  He&apos;s<br/>had lots of practice.  The final work 2 Settings from Joyce&apos;s<br/>Finnegan&apos;s Wake  by Harry Partch includes sung syllables by Meredith<br/>Borden that sound a little like a cat meowing.  For me, the lighter,<br/>fun ending to this disk was just the &quot;cat&apos;s meow.&quot;</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
