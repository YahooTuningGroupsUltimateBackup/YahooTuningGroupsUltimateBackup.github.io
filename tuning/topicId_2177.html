I couldn&apos;t resist sending this<br/>along since it has to do with listening carefully<br/>and involves parrots.</p><p>I wrote it several years ago.</p><p>You may think it has nothing to do with tuning,<br/>but it does - it addresses the whole reason many<br/>people fear alternative tuning systems.</p><p>As we all know, xenharmonic tunings sound strange<br/>when first heard, but your brain clicks and<br/>suddenly it makes perfect sense. After listening<br/>to my music for a while, music on the radio sounds<br/>_especially_ grating and out-of-tune.</p><p>It&apos;s a matter of letting yourself accept something<br/>without judging it long enough for it to have a<br/>chance to speak to you.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>Folk Tales, Listening, and Multiple Realities<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/>by X. J. Scott</p><p>One man&apos;s dream is another man&apos;s babble.</p><p>Each man&apos;s babble can be understood and/or<br/>interpreted within at least one system of symbols<br/>and beliefs, or language and culture.</p><p>All beliefs, all cultures, all art, is inherently<br/>and intrinsically without value or validity until<br/>it is interpreted. Then it is with form and from<br/>form comes meaning.</p><p>All babble, like art, is truth when understood.</p><p>Thus one man&apos;s babble is another man&apos;s truth.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the brain, perception of meaning occurs on a<br/>very high symbolic level.  Language may appear to<br/>be perceived phonically, as it is in parrots and<br/>some people, but some are able to achieve<br/>understanding from creating rather than accepting<br/>form.  This is done through exercising associative<br/>neural pathways (in the brain memory) and<br/>insights, guided by sentience, which is directly<br/>perceivable via planes of energy different from<br/>those planes most people believe they can perceive<br/>by their senses.</p><p>Because of this, what each person says is<br/>interpreted and actually phonically heard<br/>differently by different people, depending on how<br/>compatible what he is hearing is with his own<br/>system of beliefs.  The phonic content of what you<br/>hear is reconstructed from the original in your<br/>brain from patterns of thought and symbol present<br/>in the original physical communication.  To see<br/>this, note how what others say is internally only<br/>understood by yourself as you transparently mimick<br/>what they are saying in your own voice &#xFFFD; even as<br/>they speak.  Also note how most of what you think<br/>others have said is extracted from a short-term<br/>memory image of what they really have said.  You<br/>think about what the speaker has said in order to<br/>understand.  You do this while he continues to<br/>speak. Because in most Western cultures, thought<br/>is linear, not parallel &#xFFFD; you have to then listen<br/>to what has been said in the meantime by referring<br/>to your short-term memory, which is stored not as<br/>sound, but as words and ideas, interpreted by a<br/>complex process in the brain.  These words are not<br/>exactly what has been said, but a shadow.  This<br/>can easily be demonstrated by any simple &quot;pass<br/>this story on&quot; experiment.  By the time the story<br/>gets around the circle, it has little relationship<br/>to the original.</p><p>This idea of reconstructed, rather than literal<br/>memory is discussed in the article &quot;Memory,<br/>Abnormalities of&quot; in the Encyclop&#xFFFD;dia Britannica<br/>(italics added):</p><p>&#x9;While confabulation is pathological by definition,<br/>&#x9;all people include an inventive, imaginative (and<br/>&#x9;therefore spurious) element in their<br/>&#x9;remembering.... it seems valid to say that all<br/>&#x9;remembering depends /heavily/ on /reconstruction/<br/>&#x9;rather than on mere /reproduction/ alone. ... The<br/>&#x9;difference ... between normal and grossly amnesiac<br/>&#x9;confabulation may well be one of degree rather<br/>&#x9;than kind.</p><p>Here is an example of a story told by a woman<br/>raised in a village in Vietnam and now running a<br/>restaurant in Southern California.  She is a<br/>normal, sensible, practical, down-to-earth woman.<br/>Her story is heard by two people &#xFFFD; the author, and<br/>a friend &#xFFFD; and corroborated as an exact recounting<br/>of a true event by her family.</p><p>&#x9;Back home we had a special bird like a parrot, but<br/>&#x9;different. This type of bird was allergic to the<br/>&#x9;color red. If it saw the color, it would die. You<br/>&#x9;couldn&apos;t have mirrors around it because it was<br/>&#x9;part red. The bird had to eat bright red chili<br/>&#x9;peppers because of a special vitamin they<br/>&#x9;contained, or it would also die. I don&apos;t know why<br/>&#x9;it could eat the red chili peppers without dying;<br/>&#x9;no one knew how this could happen.  The bird was<br/>&#x9;very friendly.  It could talk and often told us<br/>&#x9;stories about its life in the jungle.  It was good<br/>&#x9;with children and our children loved it very much<br/>&#x9;but one day one of the children left a mirror in<br/>&#x9;its room.  Usually the bird&apos;s cage was covered but<br/>&#x9;that day it wasn&apos;t.  The bird saw its bright red<br/>&#x9;plume in the mirror and it dropped over stone dead<br/>&#x9;right away.  Everyone was very sad.</p><p>Most Westerners hearing this story will pick one<br/>of the following interpretations afterwards:</p><p>1) The woman is crazy.</p><p>2) The woman is speaking in symbols.</p><p>3) The listener will remember a different story,<br/>compatible with their own belief system.</p><p>Choice #1 is common if the tale-teller is a<br/>homeless person, or other disenfranchised<br/>individual.  When the story-teller is a friend of<br/>the listener, choices #2 or #3 are picked.  Choice<br/>#3 involves the least amount of emotional and<br/>brain power (the lazy man theory), and thus is<br/>common &#xFFFD; leading to endemic confabulation.</p><p>Thus, one listener to the woman&apos;s story re-related<br/>it as follows, only a day after hearing it:</p><p>&#x9;She had a parrot that could talk a lot.  Did you<br/>&#x9;know that birds are allergic to chili peppers?<br/>&#x9;The bird liked to look at itself in the mirror.<br/>&#x9;One day the children fed the bird red chili<br/>&#x9;peppers and it died almost right away.  Everyone<br/>&#x9;was very sad, especially the children who loved<br/>&#x9;the bird very much.</p><p>Note that the new version of the story has<br/>retained many of the details, but has been changed<br/>to comfortably fit the Western framework of<br/>pseudo-scientific belief.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>As a second example, exhibiting Choice #1 ... when<br/>my father was dying, I visited him in the<br/>hospital. He sat in the hospital bed saying<br/>&quot;Noben, roben. Soben?&quot; My brother and his wife<br/>were embarrassed by this.  My sister-in-law said,<br/>&quot;Oh dear &#xFFFD; he&apos;s been like this for days, babbling<br/>incoherently.  It&apos;s so sad that he&apos;s like this,<br/>since he once was such a great man.&quot;</p><p>But this was /their/ interpretation of what Dad was<br/>doing.  /My/ interpretation was significantly<br/>different because my life experience was<br/>different. I immediately said, &quot;Yobehn and Lobehn&quot;<br/>to which Dad replied, &quot;Oh yeah, that&apos;s it! I&apos;ve<br/>been sitting here for an hour, bored out of my<br/>mind since these guys wouldn&apos;t talk any sense to<br/>me, trying to remember the words for left and<br/>right in Chinese.&quot;  Dad was still in full control<br/>of his faculties, but since my brother hadn&apos;t been<br/>in Taiwan with my Dad and I, he simply assumed<br/>that Dad had lost his mind and was incoherent.</p><p>What might appears as babbling to many people<br/>makes sense when you have a common belief or<br/>experience.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>This final example also demonstrates Choice #1...</p><p>On this January night many years ago &#xFFFD; it was the<br/>Sunday night before classes started for my last<br/>semester at Palomar College &#xFFFD; Dee, Barry and I<br/>found ourselves chatting in a coffeehouse about<br/>this and that. There were two other tables with<br/>customers as well, chatting along. We amused<br/>ourselves with the free New Age newsletters,<br/>poetry pamphlets and civic notices we found<br/>stacked on old oak tables, as ubiquitous in San<br/>Diego coffee shops as nutmeg and three-dollar<br/>brownies.</p><p>A raggedy looking man came in, ramble-babbling<br/>like a mad man. He kept talking about the<br/>&quot;idle-ators&quot;, but it didn&apos;t make a whit of sense.<br/>People in the shop tried to ignore him &#xFFFD; as if he<br/>didn&apos;t even exist &#xFFFD; but were slightly alarmed,<br/>nonetheless.</p><p>He freaked Barry out, but Dee and I were quite<br/>amused. I myself was also intrigued. The strange<br/>thing is that the things he were saying were<br/>bizarre in the way a foreign language sounds<br/>bizarre. There was an intelligible rhythm to his<br/>words. It sounded like it made sense in some way,<br/>I just didn&apos;t understand the words. Perhaps it<br/>helped that I had seen the movie &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;<br/>with Bill Winklemann just the night before&#xFFFD;a movie<br/>which I found deeply disturbing. I was indeed<br/>deeply disturbed as a result of seeing that movie<br/>and this probably did help me relate to the old<br/>bearded guy.</p><p>We invited the old man to sit with us; he reacted<br/>as if we were some automatons whose request he<br/>decided to comply with. I started asking him<br/>questions. At first he didn&apos;t know what to do and<br/>just spurted back more confusings. I stuck to my<br/>guns. I was going to decode this guy&apos;s symbol<br/>system! I asked for definitions of every oddball<br/>term he used. They were all defined in terms of<br/>each other, a mish mash of contorted symbolism,<br/>but after a sound grilling things started to come<br/>together, albeit in a way most would find<br/>irrational. Luckily &apos;irrational logic&apos; is my<br/>specialty. Before an hour had gone by, I could<br/>understand everything he was saying. He&apos;d<br/>developed his own shorthand language to express<br/>concepts that people didn&apos;t think about so often,<br/>but which were dramatically important life issues<br/>nonetheless. His philosophy questioned everyone<br/>and everything in his life. As he realized that we<br/>were understanding him, the lecture or recital<br/>stopped and a little more of a dialog emerged. He<br/>started thinking about our questions before<br/>rattling off an answer. I wouldn&apos;t let anything<br/>ununderstood slip past. In the end I understood<br/>his theory, his philosophy, his perception of<br/>reality. It was consistent, logical and it made<br/>perfectly good sense. In fact, it was totally<br/>compatible with my own experiences and I could<br/>adopt it with few qualms. However, to do so would<br/>make me an outcast. No one would understand me. It<br/>was just too different from mainstream reality.<br/>Inconvenient too. But totally valid. It&apos;s a lonely<br/>path to chose&#xFFFD;but for some individuals reality is<br/>a little less rigid and predetermined than for<br/>most others.</p><p>In the end, Dee with very impressed. Barry had<br/>long since stepped out to smoke some cigs and had<br/>not returned. A hearty and symbolic /Bon Vivant/ he<br/>seemed to puff our way. He later chided me for<br/>taking any risk on reality. My long time<br/>friendship with him abruptly and permanently ended<br/>about one week later. In fact, I think I still<br/>have the jacket he left in my car. The other<br/>patrons in the shop had also long since escaped.<br/>They freaked out, one after another, as they<br/>overheard snippets of our conversation. In their<br/>faces, I saw not mere fear, but intense terror. To<br/>them, such a sensible and logical but different<br/>perception of reality is a real threat. When<br/>Raggedy Man was just babbling to himself, things<br/>were fine &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;but now that it was clear that a<br/>normal-looking person like myself completely<br/>understood him &#xFFFD; well, that was just too much,<br/>since it ruled-out the &quot;choice #1&quot; insanity<br/>assumption, leaving their perception of reality<br/>unable to defend itself. To them, understanding<br/>and perhaps even tolerating alien belief systems<br/>means possibly believing them. Belief in such a<br/>system is a one-way ticket to total and complete<br/>social alienation. Not you as alienated from<br/>society, but society as alienated from you. It&apos;s<br/>just not acceptable to believe in something<br/>/totally/ different. It was actually scary,<br/>considering the things he said. No way to disprove<br/>any of it, it was a wonderfully constructed,<br/>totally consistent system. Not many people are<br/>genius enough to invent something so fantastic,<br/>complete and logical, yet totally different from<br/>everything we know.</p><p>Here&apos;s a sample of a snippet of the conversation<br/>between myself and Raggedy Man:</p><p>RM:&#x9;The idle-ators, they don&apos;t see the river!<br/>The idle-ators don&apos;t see the river!</p><p>Me:&#x9;Who are the idle-ators?</p><p>RM:&#x9;They are the ones that look but who don&apos;t<br/>see.</p><p>Me:&#x9;What don&apos;t they see?</p><p>RM:&#x9;They don&apos;t see the river! The idle-ators,<br/>they don&apos;t see the river!</p><p>Me:&#x9;Why don&apos;t they see the river?</p><p>RM:&#x9;They don&apos;t see the water. They don&apos;t see<br/>the fish. They don&apos;t see the grass. They don&apos;t see<br/>the rocks at the bottom of the river. They don&apos;t<br/>see the sky or the wind. Because they only see<br/>themselves! They cannot see the river if they only<br/>see themselves!</p><p>Me:&#x9;Oh! They see their own /reflection/ in the<br/>river and thus don&apos;t see the river itself! Because<br/>they are enraptured with their own importance.<br/>Like Narcissus whom you&apos;re referencing through<br/>this metaphor.  Idolators&#xFFFD;those who idolize or<br/>worship material things rather than spiritual.<br/>They worship themselves.</p><p>RM:&#x9;Yes.</p><p>So with an open, nonjudgmental mind &#xFFFD; so<br/>nonjudgmental that you can attentively listen to<br/>just about anything without getting upset, you can<br/>do a bit of sleuthing, buy someone a cup of<br/>coffee, and learn something remarkable, such as<br/>the details of how the birds were telling RM what<br/>was really going on and the CIA&apos;s successful plot<br/>to silence the birds.</p><p>As an intriguing aside, there is a species of<br/>North American Click Beetle known as the &quot;Eyed<br/>Elator&quot; (/Alaus oculatus/).</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>This reconstruction of meaning, cast into the<br/>context of the listener&apos;s own belief system, is a<br/>serious problem when listening to stories told by<br/>others, particularly stories told by others who<br/>are from a different culture.  Unless a story is<br/>labeled as an allegory, metaphor, parable, or folk<br/>tale, it is tempting for the listener to map the<br/>entire tale into his own perception, thus<br/>distorting, or even obliterating the point.</p><p>But it is also a problem when translating poetry<br/>and spiritual books, both dealing with abstract<br/>concepts, symbolism and hidden meaning, which was<br/>assembled within the context of the writer&apos;s own<br/>experience and culture.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>If you listen very carefully and attentively with<br/>the belief and understanding that other people you<br/>encounter may actually be living in a unique<br/>universe &#xFFFD; one very intriguing and very different<br/>from yours, yet just as valid and every bit as<br/>real &#xFFFD; then you may find people to say many<br/>surprising things, such as we found in our first<br/>story.  Some things beautiful and some terrifying,<br/>but all true in that other person&apos;s universe.<br/>Theirs is a universe that does not conflict nor<br/>contradict, that need never threaten your own<br/>universe should you realize it is separate from<br/>your own, but equally valid.  It only coexists<br/>with yours in a vast system if swirling twirling<br/>churning, occasionally interlocking and/or<br/>intertwining realities.</p><p>If you like, you can accept certain new concepts<br/>you encounter and throw out others, creating,<br/>evolving, perpetually modifying, even transcending<br/>your own reality.  Just make sure it is true to<br/>you and what you really want, need and want to<br/>believe, and not accepting of influences and<br/>pressures to change your reality to match that of<br/>another&apos;s.  Insecure and fearful people may try to<br/>force other people to change their perception to<br/>match their own.  They do this in order to make<br/>their own perception seem more valid, more real.<br/>They feel a need to do this because they do not<br/>understand.  Succumbing to these pressures will<br/>eventually result in imprisoning yourself in a<br/>false system, thus losing your true freedom,<br/>freedom to perceive in your own way and perhaps<br/>losing your own soul, annihilated by the beliefs<br/>of others.  Only one person may experience each<br/>perception of reality; to accept another&apos;s<br/>perception is to annihilate your individuality,<br/>your sovereignty, your sentience, your soul, to be<br/>one with them, giving them a perverse and twisted<br/>power that is the seed from which evil grows,<br/>develops, and matures.</p></div>
