There aren&apos;t any<br/>&gt;symmetrical neutronic scales here as you need three notes from the<br/>&gt;alternative spiral of fifths.</p><p>Don&apos;t know what you mean. Look at Manuel&apos;s list (have you really found<br/>it? Where?) under 24-tone. You&apos;ll see 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 there, as well as<br/>some modes of &quot;my&quot; Arabic scale.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Well, I&apos;m not a big fan of maximal evenness, as my paper makes clear.<br/>If<br/>&gt;&gt;I could rewrite the contest, I&apos;d eliminate that, but maybe allow for a<br/>&gt;&gt;structure that spans a 5:4 and occurs 3 times in every octave span (as<br/>&gt;&gt;in the ME 22-out-of-41).</p><p>&gt;Ah yes, if in doubt, change the rules! The version of your paper I&apos;ve<br/>got<br/>&gt;(the original HTML one) doesn&apos;t make clear any dislike of maximal<br/>evenness<br/>&gt;that I can see.</p><p>Uh-uh. From the HTML version of my paper:</p><p>&quot;The author hears the standard pentachordal modes as most stable and<br/>most likely to define key centers and modulatory practice. The tonic<br/>chords of the alternate pentachordal modes may simply serve as points of<br/>intermediate harmonic stability within the standard pentachordal mode.<br/>The symmetrical modes have a weird, bitonal quality due to their<br/>symmetry at the half-octave&quot;</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think a melodic rule should presuppose both a 3/2 _and_ a 5/4.</p><p>Neither do I! I meant allowing for a 5/4 structure _instead_ of maximal<br/>evenness, which started out as an _alternative_ to a 3/2 structure.</p></div><h3><a id=625 href="#625">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xx</h3><span>2/5/1999 2:38:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Don&apos;t know what you mean.

I&apos;ll send it to Graham. If anyone else wants it, I can send it<br/>as an HTML attachment (60 Kb). I don&apos;t want to post it to the list,<br/>because of the line breaking by the list server. And it&apos;s a bit long,<br/>870 lines.<br/>Interpret the dry numbers at your own risk.

Traditionally (in 12-tET), the<br/>diminished, augmented, and whole-tone scales are the most common<br/>symmetrical scales, as they contain 7+/- 1 notes. Blackwood used the<br/>term in describing his 10-note scale in 15-tET, which repeats five times<br/>per octave. You&apos;d be better off using another name for your scale than<br/>&quot;symmetrical&quot;, as it is not symmetrical in the traditional<br/>music-theoretic sense, and the inversional symmetry that it does have,<br/>it shares with the &quot;tetrachordal&quot; scale.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Don&apos;t know what you mean.

I added the 11-limit stuff nearly two weeks ago,<br/>&gt;but obviously forgot to upload it.  I have done so now, so let&apos;s try<br/>&gt;again.</p><p>&gt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/lattice.htm#11limit">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/lattice.htm#11limit</a></p><p>Nice work! I note a few corrections:</p><p>&gt;[In a temperament where 121:120 vanishes,] we can stick the 11 midway<br/>between the 8 and &gt;the 15. That gives an 11-limit diamond looking like this:</p><p>&gt;      5<br/>&gt;     / \<br/>&gt;    /   \<br/>&gt;   /     11<br/>&gt;  /   7   \<br/>&gt; /         \<br/>&gt;1-----------3-----------9</p><p>Of course, that&apos;s not the diamond, it&apos;s just the otonality on 1/1. The<br/>diamond would be:</p><p>      10/9---------5/3---------5/4<br/>       / \         / \         / \<br/>      /   \       /   \ 10/7  /   \<br/>     /   11/9----+-----&amp;-----+---11/8<br/>    / 14/9---------7/6---------7/4/ \<br/>   /         \ /     \ / \ /***/ /   \<br/>16/9---------4/3------+--1/1--/-+----3/2---------9/8<br/>               \     / * / \ / /     / \         /<br/>                \  8/7--\---/-/12/7-/---\--9/7  /<br/>               16/11---+-\-/-@-----+---18/11   /<br/>                  \   /  7/5  \   /       \   /<br/>                   \ /         \ /         \ /<br/>                   8/5---------6/5---------9/5</p><p>* 14/11 goes here but there&apos;s no room to write it<br/>*** 11/7 goes here but there&apos;s no room to write it or any of the lines it&apos;s<br/>connected to<br/>@ 12/11 and 11/10 both go here since they&apos;re equivalent<br/>&amp; 11/6 and 20/11 both go here since they&apos;re equivalent</p><p>&gt;The other approximation is to set the neutral third of 11/9 to be exactly<br/>half a fifth of &gt;3/2. This gives the comma (-1 5 0 0 -2)H or 243/242. The<br/>11-limit diamond isn&apos;t so compact &gt;as above.</p><p>&gt;      5<br/>&gt;     / \<br/>&gt;    /   \<br/>&gt;   /     \<br/>&gt;  /   7   \<br/>&gt; /         \<br/>&gt;1-----------3-----------9-----11</p><p>Again, that&apos;s an otonality.

The most notable is<br/>72, because it&apos;s &gt;very good in the 11-limit. So, it&apos;s an accurate<br/>representation of just intonation where &gt;all commas are finite.</p><p>Actually, 72 works with the second approximation. 243:242 vanishes in 72.</p></div>
