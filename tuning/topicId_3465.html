Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@value.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/1999 3:52:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like very much to emphasize my non-accusatory<br/>intentions in a recent installment of an ongoing dialogue with Joe<br/>Monzo and Paul Erlich.</p><p>While these discussions can be both educational and invigorating for<br/>all concerned, I want to counteract any suggestions of an &quot;accusation&quot;<br/>which might have been perceived in the post which Monz quotes<br/>below. In fact, I much appreciate his wording which asks if my two<br/>paragraphs in question may have been a juxtaposition rather than a<br/>connected &quot;accusation.&quot; Indeed, only the second paragraph was directed<br/>to Monz, the first being a general statement about traditions of music<br/>history far more conventional than Monz&apos;s (and I mean that as a<br/>definite compliment to Monz!):</p><p>&gt;[Margo Schulter, TD 209.19]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Here I do not wish to make invidious comparisons, since each<br/>&gt;&gt; theory nicely fits the style of a beautiful music. However,<br/>&gt;&gt; I do wish to counteract the common view of &quot;progress&quot; in which<br/>&gt;&gt; the 18th-century harmonic system becomes a kind of directive<br/>&gt;&gt; goal for all previous practice and theory. The 3-limit harmony<br/>&gt;&gt; of the 13th century is very beautiful, and very non-18th-century.</p><p>(Here I might have also quoted Joseph Yasser&apos;s _Medieval Quartal<br/>Harmony_, to show that this has been debated for over 60 years.)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Monz raises the question as to whether medieval theorists<br/>&gt;&gt; described Pythagorean tuning because they did not have available<br/>&gt;&gt; the mathematics to describe anything else, theory&apos;s tools<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;improving&quot; between 1300 and 1500.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if the accusation I perceive here was intended<br/>&gt; or just a result of the juxtaposition of those two paragraphs.</p><p>It was indeed a juxtaposition, and had I anticipated the possibility<br/>of this kind of misunderstanding, I would have explicitly made some<br/>disclaimer of such a reading.</p><p>&gt; I certainly do believe that music theory&apos;s tools &apos;improved&apos; between<br/>&gt; 1300 and 1500, as mathematical knowledge increased and the printing<br/>&gt; press was invented, etc.</p><p>As discussed later in my article, I certainly agree that the emerging<br/>mathematics of irrational quantities made possible Renaissance<br/>theories of temperament which would obviously have been impossible<br/>using only integer ratios. Also, the printing press indeed permitted a<br/>freer sharing of knowledge in this and many other areas.</p><p>At the same time, one might argue that in some ways medieval theory could<br/>be considered more &quot;sophisticated&quot; on questions such as concord/discord --<br/>as I did elsewhere in my post.</p><p>&gt; However, I want to make it clear that *I* do *not* hold the view<br/>&gt; that &apos;the 18th-century harmonic system becomes a kind of directive<br/>&gt; goal for all previous practice and theory&apos;.</p><p>Again, I would emphasize, as your response itself suggested, that the<br/>first paragraph you quoted addressed this view as a general theme of<br/>much music history, with only the second paragraph taking up your<br/>opinion regarding questions of medieval theory.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
