As are the sounds already on my<br/>website, the second phase of my project tries to produce music reminiscent<br/>of music one might have heard in the frontier town Los Angeles in<br/>1850-1876.  I suppose there were plenty of pianos lovingly brought to L.A.,<br/>but perhaps only one tuner to tune them?  So the reality was probably that<br/>they were either badly tuned, or tuned to that tuner&apos;s favorite<br/>temperament.  I have not met Manuel, but did receive information from<br/>others about meantones, Werckmeisters, and the Lucy tuning, all of which I<br/>am itching to try this evening.</p><p>As for my JI guess, I was thinking of harmonicas and got my scale degrees<br/>wrong.  The standard 10-hole harmonica is often played in the key of its<br/>5th scale tone (e.g. A on a D harp).  The 4th scale degree then becomes the<br/>flat7th degree of the new scale, and it is that which I guessed was 27<br/>cents flat (and actually is more like 31?).  In fact, the few harmonicas<br/>today that are advertised by the manufacturers as &quot;just&quot; tuned have their<br/>4th scale note tuned ~30 cents flat of the 1st and 5th scale notes, so<br/>apparently the &quot;key&quot; of the JI is not the named key of the harp, but fifth<br/>note of that scale. I&apos;m sure there are other egregious problems with my<br/>hurried guess as well.</p><p>Thanks again, all.<br/>John</p><p>At 03:17 PM 5/3/2000 -0400, you wrote:<br/>&gt;John, fixed JI tunings were certainly not being used in the mid-1800s,<br/>&gt;having been little more than theoretical curiosities since 1500.

Moreever, it was<br/>precisely in the middle of the 19th century that there was an extremely<br/>active &quot;moveable doh&quot; solfege movement in Great Britain (the key name here<br/>is John Curwen) for singing unaccompanied in a version of 5-limit JI.<br/>Though essentially an amateur movement, and the arrangements cannot be said<br/>to represent the original intentions of the composers, the repertoire of<br/>music arranged in the solfege notation was apparently very broad, with Ellis<br/>noting some 40,000 titles.  I would presume that Congregationalists in North<br/>America shared this repertoire and solfege style, and further note that the<br/>shape note singing tradition in the US was implicitly a JI system.</p><p>&lt;From: Paul H.
