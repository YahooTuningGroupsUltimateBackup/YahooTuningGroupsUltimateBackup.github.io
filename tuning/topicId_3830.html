Paul E&apos;s solution of<br/>&gt; putting the roots in meantone won&apos;t help this one.</p><p>Uhhh... well I haven&apos;t followed this whole thread closely, so I&apos;m<br/>unclear whether your goal is to have or not to have a commatic shift<br/>as a result of this progression.</p><p>My adaptive JI methods take their cues from the ET of their input.  So,<br/>with 12-tET input, I would tune each of the C, Ab, E, C chords JI,<br/>exactly 1/3 octave apart.  But, given a 19-tET input which showed<br/>commatic shift, I would leave the shift in place.</p><p>To unshift a commatic shift present in a 19-tET would be possible,<br/>though there would be some semi-challenging picky details to work out<br/>in order to program it (I may be totally away from your discussion and<br/>question here).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
