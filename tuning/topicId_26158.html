Is this a common way to devise a<br/>&gt; just intonational system?</p><p>It&apos;s somewhat common, but not overwhelmingly<br/>so. Harry Partch, for example, did not proceed this<br/>way. He did start with G as a central pitch.Then he<br/>added the first 12 overtones of G (5 more pitch<br/>classes), the first 12 subharmonics of G (5 more<br/>pitch classes), and all the notes that are within the<br/>first 12 overtones of the subharmonics (and thus<br/>also within the first 12 subharmonics of the<br/>overtones) (18 more pitch classes). The set of 29<br/>pitch classes so derived is just the set of pitches<br/>forming an 11-limit consonance with the central G.<br/>Then he filled the gaps of this rather uneven<br/>&quot;scale&quot; with closely related JI pitches (14 more<br/>pitch classes). Erv Wilson has created JI systems<br/>that emphatically lack a central or generating pitch,<br/>used by composers such as Kraig Grady. Other<br/>composers who use JI systems not derived as a<br/>single overtone series include Ben Johnston, Jon<br/>Catler, Lou Harrison, and Michael Harrison.<br/>Wendy Carlos wrote a piece where each of the<br/>tones of 12-tone equal temperament is used as the<br/>fundamental for a large harmonic series tuning<br/>(through the 21st harmonic, with the 27th added).</p><p>&gt; Are there other composers<br/>&gt; before Young who approached it this way?
