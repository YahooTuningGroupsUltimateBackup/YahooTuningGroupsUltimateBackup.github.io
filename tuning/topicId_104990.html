I can&apos;t say they&apos;ve ever reminded me of the Bohlen-Pierce scale, but I have heard some where the interval between the two lowest modes is about a 3/1 (and none where it&apos;s about a 2/1), so perhaps you&apos;re not hallucinating. =)</p><p>&gt; I looked at the tunings of the bowls and they&apos;re things like:<br/>&gt; Fundamental tone:  G# -2 Hz<br/>&gt; Rim tone: D -4 Hz</p><p>This will be completely different for different bowls, of course. Calling them &quot;fundamental tone&quot; and &quot;rim tone&quot; is a little misleading because they are both modes where mainly the rim vibrates. In the fundamental mode the circular rim deforms into an ellipse (so there are four nodes equally spaced around the rim, in a square), and in the next higher mode it deformes into a kind of rounded triangle shape (so there are six nodes, in a hexagon). Even higher modes in this series have 8, 10, 12... nodes. Also note that each of these modes is really a degenerate pair of modes, and if there&apos;s some imperfection of the bowl that breaks the circular symmetry, it will split the degeneracy and make two modes of slightly different frequency that beat with each other.</p><p>There are whole other series of modes, of course, notably the &quot;drumhead&quot; mode where the rim remains a perfect circle but the bottom of the bowl moves up and down relative to it. This mode is hardly excited at all by playing it the normal way, so it doesn&apos;t contribute to the sound, but you can hear the pitch if you flip the bowl upside down and tap sharply on the center.</p><p>All this describes the linear behavior of the bowl, such as when you strike it and let it ring, but when you make it &quot;sing&quot; you&apos;re exciting it in a non-linear mode-locked way similar to bowing a string, so all kinds of weird non-linear stuff can happen. I think this is one of the main reasons it sounds so interesting, especially in combination with the near-degenerate pairs of modes.</p><p>(As you can tell I&apos;m a little obsessed with idiophones right now. I recently figured out how to control two near-degenerate modes of some keys of the marimba I&apos;m building.)</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=104992 href="#104992">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>9/24/2012 11:45:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have some and also sample of others.
