Recently, I&apos;ve met one of the harpsichord teachers at our school (I was lucky as I actually study composition, not harpsichord) and together we made a tuning which met partially my requirements and partially hers. After setting the tuning on one of the harpsichords in the classroom last week, I made a few recordings with it. It was an uneasy task for me because I&apos;m primarily a piano player, not a harpsichordist, so the keys of the instrument felt very small to my hands and that&apos;s why I made a few mistakes there while playing. Trying to choose some recordings where there aren&apos;t too many of them, I think I&apos;ll finally pick up these two if you wish to have a listen:</p><p>Scarboro Fair: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/0428BCE6360BC529">http://download.yousendit.com/0428BCE6360BC529</a></p><p>Allemande: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/2FB43ACF62C0FC84">http://download.yousendit.com/2FB43ACF62C0FC84</a></p><p>Enjoy.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=76393 href="#76393">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2008 10:49:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>These are lovely.</p><p>Oz.</p><p>On May 19, 2008, at 9:02 AM, Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi tuners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IIRC, the last time I&apos;ve heard meantone or something similar on an<br/>&gt; acoustic<br/>&gt; instrument was quite long ago.
