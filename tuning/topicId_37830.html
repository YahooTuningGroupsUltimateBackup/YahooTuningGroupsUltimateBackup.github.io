John as many of you know, has been working with<br/>microtonality, mostly quartertones, since the 1960&apos;s.  He also has<br/>managed to get several large-scale microtonal operas produced... no<br/>small feat.</p><p>In any case, some of you might be interested in learning that, over<br/>the years, Eaton has done quite a bit *more* than just quartertones.<br/>He&apos;s done quite a bit of work, and is particularly interested in 6th<br/>tones and the 7th partial, and has Just Intonation sections in his<br/>works as well.</p><p>For those enamored of *exact* Just Intonation, you will be happy to<br/>learn that most of Eaton&apos;s instructions for such involve not much<br/>more than indicating the &quot;elimination of beats&quot; rather than any other<br/>schema.</p><p>In any case, I gave him a copy of Dave Keenan&apos;s 72-tET chart of the<br/>intervals/partials and he seemed quite fascinated with it.  In fact,<br/>he said he thought that he might &quot;use it every day...&quot;</p><p>J.

But he also<br/>has some *very* exciting things, like a wonderful piece for two<br/>quartertone pianos that he plays himself (!), not &quot;academic sounding&quot;<br/>at all, a beautiful and strange piece for several harps, and a<br/>*really* wacko piece for screaming soprano and live whirring<br/>electronics... you had to be there...</p><p>So, he&apos;s really all over the map and, personally, I like the *later*<br/>things that are less in the traditional-sounding &quot;academic&quot; camp.  We<br/>all know what that sounds like.  Some very good pieces in that<br/>school, but lots of drab ones too, as we all know.</p><p>I would recommend some of the *later* works on the New Music Box<br/>website, like the video of his _Don Quixote_ which regrettably I<br/>missed here in New York last year.  It seems to me like Partch with<br/>Western instruments... and there&apos;s not much of an &quot;academic&quot; nature<br/>in it whatsoever.</p><p>He also has a *huge* Great Dane, who is also not at all academic, I<br/>can assure you...</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>Rick Tagawa &#x3C;ricktagawa@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2002 8:59:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Julia,<br/>Thank you very much for your informative posts on the tuning list.
