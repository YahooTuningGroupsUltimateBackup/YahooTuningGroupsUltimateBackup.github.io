But this publication is quite hard to find,<br/>and I thought this article would be of such great interest<br/>to members of this list that I&apos;m quoting the entire thing<br/>here.  Many of you will be glad I did.</p><p>(I hope this is no case of copyright infringement...<br/>it may very well be.  Oh well... slap the cuffs on me now...<br/>another great sacrifice for the microtonal cause!)</p><p>At the end of my Microfest presentation, I was speculating<br/>on an idea that I&apos;ve presented here before: that since<br/>all of Mahler&apos;s major works are for orchestra - which<br/>plays in strict 12-tET only with some difficulty and<br/>a lot of coaxing and rehearsal - perhaps the &quot;best&quot; tuning<br/>for his symphonies is something other than 12-tET.</p><p>Warren Burt attended my lecture, and after I finished, he<br/>generously informed me of this article by Peter Yates in<br/>which Yates mentions that Mahler once told Schoenberg that<br/>it was too bad that European music chucked meantone in favor<br/>of 12-tET, and lost so many harmonic possibilities.  AHA!<br/>Just the ammunition I was looking for to justify (all puns<br/>intended) the retuning of my Mahler MIDI-files!  They&apos;ll be<br/>posted here as soon as I retune them, and no longer with an<br/>&quot;off-topic&quot; warning as I&apos;ve used in the past!</p><p>Yates speaks quite a bit about tuning in this article.<br/>Two other quotes from it that will interest readers here:</p><p>&quot;Just because [Harry Partch and Lou Harrison] have not<br/>accepted the easy alternative of following nearly everybody<br/>else in the wrong direction, they are among the most<br/>important musical thinkers in the world today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In his later years Schoenberg linked himself playfully<br/>with Gesualdo, whom he called &apos;the Schoenberg of the<br/>16th century&apos;&quot;.</p><p>And here are two that are simply too good not to repeat:</p><p>&quot;Ives, to put the matter simply, replaced Parker&apos;s<br/>Europeanized quotations from the best eclectic sources<br/>with good American quotations that nobody could mistake<br/>as academic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or hear Webern&apos;s early Piano Quintet, the fragments<br/>of authentic Webern like minute bits of living tissue<br/>among the dead stretches of imitation Brahms.&quot;</p><p>Yates is the sole source for several anecdotes I have<br/>heard or read about Schoenberg, including his description<br/>here of Schoenberg&apos;s 1st Quartet.  They knew each other<br/>personally when Schoenberg lived in Los Angeles, and<br/>Yates was responsible for getting a lot of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>music performed in LA in those days, principally in the<br/>&quot;concerts on the roof&quot; series held at his house in the 1940s.</p><p>There&apos;s also a very long section on Ives, which many<br/>here (attention, Dan Stearns!) will appreciate.</p><p>And it was great to read about Var&egrave;se right after hearing<br/>Steven Schick&apos;s ensemble &quot;red fish blue fish&quot; play Schick&apos;s<br/>terrific arrangement of _Ionisation_ for 6 players (it was<br/>originally written for 13) at the SONOR concert tonight at<br/>UCSD.  _Ionisation_, besides being a landmark and extremely<br/>influential piece, also counts here as microtonal because it<br/>uses two sirens to produce nice not-quite-controllable glissandi.</p><p>The comments by Var&egrave;se about not being a revolutionary are<br/>also interesting, because they were emphasized at the<br/>pre-concert talk tonight by Chou Wen-Chung, whose great piece<br/>_Echoes From The Gorge_ (for percussion quartet) was featured<br/>prominently, and who studied with Var&egrave;se.  Note especially the<br/>comment by Var&egrave;se about his lack of interest in tuning.</p><p>Note also that this article is one of the earliest (c. 1960)<br/>&quot;popular&quot; recognitions of well-temperament that I have come<br/>across. (Try to remember or realize how &quot;underground&quot; all this<br/>tuning stuff was back then.)</p><p>The actual article is worth seeking out for the great<br/>photos (which I&apos;ve never seen anywhere else) of Partch,<br/>Harrison (whom I had the great pleasure of meeting at<br/>Microfest), Ives, Var&egrave;se, and Cage.

Among his many accomplishments, he has learned to<br/>build harpsichords and clavichords from the sound outwards.<br/>String by string, working on a monochord, he plans the<br/>sound pattern of the instrument, the scale, the length<br/>and weight of string, the plucking-point; then he plots<br/>this scale upon a sheet of drafting paper and designs the<br/>instrument around it. Some instrument builders do it the<br/>reverse way: they begin by using for a model an authentic<br/>instrument, and the sound comes afterwards. Let us take<br/>this for our parable.</p><p>Studies of the sound an instrument should produce directed<br/>Wesley to inquire about tuning. He began wondering why,<br/>since the invention of keyboard instruments, the tuning<br/>of these instruments has changed several times. He taught<br/>himself painstakingly how to tune, with nothing but the<br/>instrument to guide him, each of the principal temperaments<br/>of European music. These tuning orders, the means by which<br/>our forefathers adjusted their instruments to the music<br/>that was to be played and then used them to create new<br/>instrumental idioms, are the basic facts of the development<br/>of European music, its styles, its habits, its harmonic<br/>systems, its methods of organization, its manners of<br/>performance. The 4 1/2 hour tape that Wesley Kuhnle has<br/>developed, a History of Tuning, may be one of the more<br/>significant musicological achievements of our lifetime.</p><p>When he began we had knowledge of tour historic types of<br/>tuning, or temperament, plus several deviants of these.<br/>The four are: _Pythagorean_ (perfect fifths in all intervals<br/>except one, which absorbs the imbalance between the perfect<br/>octave and the lesser perfect intervals within it);<br/>_Just Intonation_ (which combines the principal perfect<br/>fifths with the principal perfect thirds [i.e., 5-limit JI);<br/>_Meantone_ (which narrows all the fifths to produce as many<br/>perfect thirds as possible); and our own tuning,<br/>_Equal Temperament_.  [Of course, we here also know that<br/>there are well-temperaments - on which does speak below<br/>- as well as other non-just non-equal tunings.]  Equal<br/>Temperament, though in some ways the most practical, is<br/>acoustically the most imperfect tuning. [Comment from<br/>Monzo: this is certainly a debatable point.  Feel free.]</p><p>As a result of these investigations Wesley Kuhnle added<br/>two more temperaments: _Tempered Pythagorean_, beginning<br/>with the perfect fifth as Meantone begins with the perfect<br/>third; and _Well Tempered_, the much modified Meantone<br/>identified with the work of J. S. Bach.</p><p>Pythagorean was the principal temperament of European<br/>music for about 2000 years, until the 16th century.<br/>It is purely melodic and allows only simple harmony.<br/>Polyphonic music of the earlier centuries would sound far<br/>more expressive in our ears, if it were sung in Pythagorean<br/>perfect fifths instead of Equal Temperament. Every upward<br/>interval rises to its full height, instead of falling short<br/>by the slight fraction of our imperfect fifths.</p><p>As polyphony became more elaborate during the 15th and 16th<br/>centuries, composers began seeking a temperament which<br/>would allow some pure thirds as well as some pure fifths.<br/>They developed in Italy a new temperament called Just<br/>Intonation [Comment from Monzo: &quot;temperament&quot; to describe<br/>JI is not really correct.], used by Palestrina and Vittoria.<br/>Some modem choirs have been trained to sing in Just<br/>Intonation; it is easier to sing than Equal Temperament<br/>and vocally far more beautiful.</p><p>These two primarily vocal temperaments permit very<br/>little of what we nowadays call harmony and modulation<br/>on conventional, fixed-pitch keyboard instruments.<br/>When during the 16th century primacy in music passed<br/>from the voice to instruments, a distinctive keyboard<br/>tuning was developed, having all the principal thirds<br/>tuned perfect or beatless and all the fifths slightly<br/>narrowed. This keyboard-related tuning, called Meantone,<br/>survived in general use until the first decade of the<br/>19th century. Meantone provides good harmony in 8 keys,<br/>up to three sharps or flats, so long as one avoids a few<br/>dissonant combinations which are called collectively<br/>&quot;the Wolf&quot;. If you examine the classical literature of<br/>keyboard music before Schubert and Chopin, you will find<br/>that, with the important exceptions of Sebastian Bach<br/>and Domenico Scarlatti, the composers confined themselves<br/>almost entirely within the few Meantone keys.</p><p>A second keyboard-adapted temperament is the newly<br/>discovered Tempered Pythagorean, but since it does not<br/>enter directly into this survey, I shall go no farther<br/>with it.  [Comment from Monzo: Too bad he didn&apos;t.  I&apos;m<br/>sure many of us would love to know what he was talking<br/>about.]</p><p>Hearing English virginal music in this tuning after<br/>hearing it in Equal Temperament is like seeing for the<br/>first time in the original color a painting known before<br/>but in black and white. I might add, for specialists,<br/>that it solves the problem presented by the Bull _Hexachord_.<br/>[Comment from Monzo: Those in the know, please elaborate.]</p><p>Sebastian Bach was one of several composers and theorists<br/>who set out to temper Meantone tuning so that it might be<br/>used in full chords in all keys without any excessively<br/>dissonant combinations. Such a tuning is called Well<br/>Tempered. Meantone tuning is the easiest to tune accurately<br/>on a keyboard instrument. Well Tempered is very difficult<br/>to tune. Therefore Meantone lingered on for a long time.<br/>In Meantone each of the 8 keys has a distinct harmonic<br/>coloration, to which composers and listeners attached<br/>emotional and dramatic connotations related to the figurative<br/>devices known as the Affections. Well Tempered tuning<br/>preserved these distinctions, though the color differentiation<br/>was reduced.</p><p>When composers turned to Equal Temperament, in part<br/>because of the easy accommodation it provides for tuning<br/>all the instruments of an orchestra [comment by Monzo: I<br/>would disagree with this - keyboards were mainly responsible],<br/>these color distinctions among keys were lost. I believe it<br/>was Arnold Schoenberg that reported to me Gustav Mahler&apos;s<br/>comment that European music, in giving up Meantone tuning,<br/>had suffered a great loss. Because all intervals of the<br/>same sort in Equal Temperament are mathematically and<br/>acoustically of equal imperfection, all keys sound exactly<br/>the same, apart from their relative position. To make up<br/>for the lost key coloration, which as we know from their<br/>writings musicians and theorists long struggled to preserve,<br/>composers added more and more harmonic enrichment, reaching<br/>towards increasing extremes of dissonance, until at last<br/>all differences among the keys disappeared theoretically<br/>as they had already vanished for the ear. They disappeared<br/>just as thoroughly in Strauss as in Schoenberg, but<br/>Schoenberg was the first to recognize what had happened<br/>and do something about it.  [Comment from Monzo: This<br/>paragraph is exremely pertinent to what I presented in my<br/>lecture.]</p><p>To overcome what seemed, at least to a German composer,<br/>the disadvantage of composing without key references,<br/>Schoenberg introduced the method of the tone-row, in which<br/>the 12 tones of the octave are related only to one another,<br/>the accompanying rules providing a partial substitute for<br/>the invalidated rules of harmony. Schoenberg&apos;s purpose was,<br/>as he said, the emancipation of the dissonance, to establish<br/>a new convention of tonal relationship which no longer<br/>technically denied but instead realistically accepted the<br/>equal component of dissonance in every interval. Schoenberg<br/>did not consider the 12-tone method to be a means of<br/>composition, any more than the rules of harmony are a means<br/>of composition. He condemned those among his followers who<br/>chose so to use it. In spite of his strictures, 12-tone or<br/>serial composition has become a new composing formula,<br/>a new technical academicism. (See the comment by William<br/>J. Mitchell in his edition of the _Essay on the True Art<br/>of Playing Keyboard Instruments_ by C. P. E. Bach, page 17:<br/>&quot;Bach&apos;s rejection of Rameau can be traced largely to the<br/>fact that the latter had pronounced a *theory*, whereas<br/>thorough bass was essentially a practice.&quot;)</p><p>The principal theory of composition holding attention in<br/>the world today is founded therefore on a misuse, the<br/>false understanding of a convention. Given that convention,<br/>the composer is on his own. He can use the method with<br/>a row of more or less than 12 tones. He can use it just<br/>as well to eliminate unwanted dissonance. He can use it<br/>to establish a key reference and to escape it again when<br/>he wishes. He can use it even without accurately pitched<br/>tones. The more thoroughly he understands it, the better<br/>he should be able to modify the convention to his purpose.</p><p>So much for the tone-row or serial method which engrosses<br/>our present day composing theory. It is a partial replacement<br/>for the lost harmonic method, a polyphonic extension of<br/>musical syntax with a consequent loss of harmonic and<br/>modulatory formulas. As it has become itself a formula,<br/>the effect has been to magnify the artless dissonances<br/>inherent in Equal Temperament. When listeners have grown<br/>weary of listening to more and more unrelieved dissonance,<br/>undifferentiated by consonance or by the textural distinction<br/>of great melody as in Schoenberg and Webern, this whole<br/>technical academicism will most likely be thrown out of<br/>use. We have seen the formula grow; we already see it dying.<br/>[Comment from Monzo: Such a prophetic comment in 1960!]<br/>But Schoenberg will remain and so will Webern, composers<br/>first and only afterwards technicians.</p><p>Don&apos;t believe by the way that there is no real distinction<br/>between consonance and dissonance. That notion is merely<br/>another of the consequences of Equal Temperament. If theory<br/>won&apos;t tell us, our ears will. No fixed point exists at<br/>which tolerable consonance becomes intolerable dissonance<br/>or discordance. Several extended passages of Bach&apos;s F sharp<br/>minor Toccata, fully acceptable in Well Tempered Tuning,<br/>become intolerable in Meantone. Playing this Toccata in<br/>Equal Temperment eliminates Bach&apos;s coloring entirely, so<br/>that nothing remains of the composition except its notational<br/>design, and much of that obviously inexplicable.</p><p>On this second point, let me cite another example. One<br/>evening I invited Igor Stravinsky and several others to<br/>my home to hear a Japanese musician, newly come to this<br/>country, play the koto. The player chose to begin with<br/>a modern composition for the koto tuned in Equal Temperament.<br/>After hearing this, followed by an older composition played<br/>in the same tuning. Stravinsky objected that the tuning<br/>was not correct for the instrument. Though Stravinsky<br/>had no previous experience of the instrument or its<br/>correct intervallic tuning, his acute ear had told him<br/>at once what the performer, for all his sensitivity,<br/>had accustomed himself to forget, that the koto and its<br/>tuning belonged together; one could not alter the tuning<br/>without altering the nature of the instrument.</p><p>To anyone accustomed to hearing the original in its ownidiom<br/>Colin McPhee&apos;s transcriptions of Indonesian gamelan music<br/>for two pianos or Henry Cowell&apos;s use of the style of<br/>Japanese Court music in his orchestral composition _Ongaku_<br/>present no less serious objections.</p><p>Two American composers have found means to release their<br/>compositions from the disintegrating key harmony and<br/>increasing dissonance inherent in the continuing use of<br/>Equal Temperament. They are Harry Partch and Lou Harrison.<br/>Just because these composers have not accepted the easy<br/>alternative of following nearly everybody else in the<br/>wrong direction, they are among the most important musical<br/>thinkers in the world today. The course of esthetic<br/>evolution is inevitably by way of the exceptional rather<br/>than the routine occurrence.</p><p>Harry Partch was the first to attain the uncompromising<br/>wisdom that Equal Temperament must he abandoned. His<br/>reasons for thinking so are set forth in his book,<br/>_Genesis of a Music_. He divided the scale in minute<br/>subdivisions, working out at about 43 intervals to the<br/>octave, though, like Schoenberg in regard to the 12-tone<br/>method, he insists that the numerical count of his scale<br/>has nothing to do with the music ho makes of it. By this<br/>minute subdivision of the octave Partch approximates the<br/>natural intervals of the speaking or chanting in contrast<br/>to the singing voice. He eliminates harmony as a<br/>determinant, gets rid of its grammar, [Comment from Monzo:<br/>I think both those points are debatable.] and removes the<br/>unwanted consequences of Equal Temperament.  His early<br/>experiments were made on viola and reed organ; only later<br/>did he begin building his kitharas and marimbas. [Comment<br/>by Monzo: altho it wasn&apos;t finished until later, Partch<br/>actually began building his kithara in the mid-1930s,<br/>immediately after his visit to Kathleen Schlesinger in<br/>England, and quite early on in his career.]  His music<br/>will be compared with gamelan music only by those who<br/>do not know the gamelan.</p><p>In Partch&apos;s music there is strictly speaking no dissonance,<br/>except among the higher overtones, which the open resonances<br/>of his string and wooden sound-producers give out in<br/>abundance. Thus the foreground of musical texture is very<br/>pure and clear, while the sonority glows with rich and<br/>subtle contrast. Partch conceives his art to be music of<br/>the theatre, to he used with voice or balletÂ—not as an<br/>operatic or an absolute music. Nothing in the medium,<br/>however, prevents it being used for an absolute music.</p><p>Lou Harrison took a different direction than Partch.<br/>After studying with Schoenberg and displaying great skill<br/>in manipulating the 12-tone row Â— the big 12-tone Piano<br/>Suite he wrote at that time for my wife is soon to be<br/>published Â— he progressively discarded dissonance. He<br/>came at last to wonder why Schoenberg, having reduced<br/>all harmony to a single key of 12 tones, had not gone<br/>farther and retuned the intervals to approximate the<br/>acoustically more perfect intervals of Just Intonation.<br/>[Comment from Monzo: Something I&apos;ve wondered about much<br/>myself. Schoenberg gave at least two important reasons:<br/>lack of microtonal instruments, and increased resources<br/>of his way of using the whole 12-tET scale as a unit.]<br/>If Schoenberg had done this, all other factors being the<br/>same, serial composition would now be fundamentally<br/>consonant instead of dissonant. The dissonance, instead<br/>of being emancipated, would have vanished with Equal<br/>Temperament. (I should say here that Schoenberg was well<br/>aware of the problem). Harrison himself now composes in<br/>Just Intonation, and his subtle ear, made acute by years<br/>of earlier sound exploration while writing compositions<br/>in non-tonal polyphony for a great variety of sound-<br/>producers, remains creatively unhampered by the lack of<br/>ordinary harmonic devices and modulation.</p><p>Although the use of Just Intonation would seem to<br/>present insuperable difficulties in performance,<br/>experience has shown that musicians can adapt themselves<br/>to these acoustically correct intervals more easily<br/>than adjust themselves back again to Equal Temperament.</p><p>In effect, Harrison has returned composition to that point<br/>in the 15th century where the direction of interest began<br/>changing towards vertical harmony; he goes on from there<br/>as happily and creatively as if Bach and Beethoven had<br/>never existed.</p><p>Love and revere the music of Bach and Beethoven as I do,<br/>I know that we must accustom ourselves to removing these<br/>great figures out of the foreground of our musical<br/>understanding, if we are to discover the vistas of genius<br/>they conceal. We must also get out of the way the present<br/>cult-devotion to counterpoint and complication, the notion<br/>that an expertly written score is necessarily music. We<br/>should free ourselves from the contrary superstition also,<br/>that any composition which does not accord with the<br/>prevailing criteria is necessarily not music Â— the sort<br/>of nonsense spoken about John Cage.</p><p>A good deal of music these days is being written to<br/>seem more difficult than it is. Much of the technical<br/>difficulty in later Schoenberg or Webern, or Boulez,<br/>is the result of their effort to notate exactly the<br/>sort of extra-rhythmic expressiveness that a 16th, 17th,<br/>or 18th century musician was supposed to react into the<br/>notation at the time of playing. As my patron Amateur,<br/>the Englishman Roger North, wrote in the early 18th<br/>century: &quot;It is not of great import how the breaking<br/>is managed, provided the general equallitys are maintained;<br/>on which account it is that the capitall masters, in<br/>their performing, capreole it in such a manner as one<br/>would think they kept no time at all, and yet they never<br/>fail their gross measures.&apos;&apos; This is an art we have lost,<br/>and we shall never recover it by exact notation. I have<br/>observed, however, that Pierre Boulez, though he divides<br/>the time of his compositions to a fine measure, does not<br/>conduct to the point of the metronome but melodically.</p><p>The bigotries I speak of are changing, but the academic-<br/>fashionable intelligence still clings to them, as if<br/>ability to analyze a score without hearing it were the<br/>chief proof of competence. Analytical competence ceases<br/>exactly at that place where it ceases to be operative:<br/>Sir Donald Tovey [renowned writer of critical essays]<br/>was helpless before the 20th century.</p><p>So Harrison&apos;s seeming simplicity baffles the generality<br/>of sophisticated listeners, who presume that contemporary<br/>music, if it is to be taken seriously, must appear difficult.<br/>Those of us who hear not as fashionably sophisticated<br/>listeners but as posterity will not be so deceived but<br/>will recognize in Harrison one of the most exquisitely<br/>balanced gifts for music in our century.</p><p>Partch and Harrison are two of the composers in the<br/>American Experimental Tradition. Their workmanship outmodes<br/>the authority&apos; of that great period of European music,<br/>between 1600 and 1900, the period of European Vertically<br/>Related Harmony. or as I prefer to call it, the period<br/>of Modern Music. Calling these 300 years the period of<br/>Modern Music helps us to join, as if at each end of a<br/>parenthesis, the 20th with the 16th century. There are<br/>other kinds of harmony besides the vertically-related,<br/>as our increasing knowledge of the world&apos;s other musics<br/>now informs us, the most prevalent being the horizontal<br/>harmony of self-sustained melody. It is precisely the<br/>putting aside of the recent European tradition that<br/>distinguishes, that is the characteristic craft mark of<br/>American Experimental composition.</p><p>Schoenberg was not the only or the first composer to<br/>recognize the end of what I have called the period of<br/>Modern or Vertically Related Harmonic Music. In his<br/>later years Schoenberg linked himself playfully with<br/>Gesualdo, whom he called &quot;the Schoenberg of the 16th<br/>century.&quot; Charles Ives, whose lifetime runs concurrently<br/>with that of Schoenberg, came to the truth earlier and<br/>no less conclusively. Unlike Schoenberg, he did not consider<br/>this to be a problem requiring theoretical solution. He<br/>took his art as he found it, and he found it crowded with<br/>opportunity. If you listen to _Hora Novissima_, the best<br/>work of Ives&apos;s music professor at Yale, that onetime cynosure<br/>of American academic good taste, Horatio Parker, you will<br/>find it studded with quotations from and references to the<br/>best European composers. Brahms&apos;s Tragic Overture comes in<br/>right at the start, and there is a later movement a capella,<br/>a fine Palestrinian imitation. _Hora Novissima_ is a splendid<br/>composition, to be praised in company with the work of<br/>Parker&apos;s other famous pupil, Roger Sessions. Compared with<br/>such self-taught composers as Wagner and Schoenberg, Horatio<br/>Parker was a master: he had mastered everything about music<br/>a composer doesn&apos;t need to know. Ives, to put the matter<br/>simply, replaced Parker&apos;s Europeanized quotations from the<br/>best eclectic sources with good American quotations that<br/>nobody could mistake as academic. The tunes don&apos;t make the<br/>music American; harmonizing of national tunes and folk<br/>music had been going on for a century, and nothing had<br/>come from it. Like Bach and at least as thoroughly as<br/>Bart&oacute;k, Ives took the native idiom and made it his own<br/>language.</p><p>There is one important distinction. Bach&apos;s choral melodies,<br/>though they were the commonplace of musical experience in<br/>his society, are not commonplace for us; Bart&oacute;k&apos;s folk<br/>melodies came out of a culture nearly forgotten by its<br/>own people: Ives drew his melodies out of our childhood<br/>experience, and we have trouble abstracting them as we<br/>quite naturally abstract Bach&apos;s and Bart&oacute;k&apos;s melodies. We<br/>are embarrassed by them, as many have not ceased being<br/>embarrassed by song or opera in English.</p><p>Ives had trained his ear by listening to a great variety<br/>of sounds that are not, in the technical or European sense,<br/>harmonic. He listened to bands playing in competition with<br/>other bands, to the sounds of divided instrumental groups<br/>coming from different distances and directions, to singers<br/>singing off key and masses of untrained voices singing<br/>hymns, to popular airs and ragtime and patriotic tunes,<br/>and to the minute distinctions among noises and rhythms<br/>that are the product of such acoustical divergences. All<br/>of us hear such things, but Â— as John Cage is forever<br/>reminding us Â— few of us listen to them. Fewer hear them<br/>as a means of music.</p><p>Ives was gifted with an eye that could translate the<br/>appearance of nature into tonal resemblances. He wielded<br/>as wide a vocabulary of words as any American poet or<br/>author. To open Ives&apos;s little book _Essays Before A Sonata_<br/>is to be tempted to quotation. I choose one of the less<br/>commonly repeated and less ingratiating, from the essay<br/>_Emerson_. It applies as immediately to the music of lves.</p><p>&grave;&grave;Emerson is definite in that his art is based on something<br/>stronger than the amusing or at its best the beguiling of<br/>a few mortals.  If he uses a sensuous chord, it is not for<br/>sensuous ears.  His harmonies may float, if the wind blows<br/>in the right direction, through a voluptuous atmosphere,<br/>but he has not Debussy&apos;s fondness for trying to blow a<br/>sensuous atmosphere from his own voluptuous cheeks.&quot;</p><p>Ives was always a bit hard on Debussy, though he set a<br/>high value on _La Mer_. Debussy represented for him the<br/>composer who deliberately makes pretty art. He is &quot;the<br/>city-man who comes out for a Sunday in the country.&quot; Ives,<br/>by contrast, was a country-man who went to live for a<br/>while in the city; he heard each as a part of nature,<br/>the Housatonic in one mode and in another _Central Park<br/>in the Dark_. Here are three private musings from the<br/>manuscript sketches for the First Piano Sonata. I borrow<br/>them out of the heroic catalogue of Ives&apos;s manuscripts<br/>prepared and privately issued by John Kirkpatrick. From<br/>the 4th movement: &quot;Left hand a little louder than right<br/>hand as a kind of the nature sounds which like a tree toad<br/>etc sometimes is heard in the woods, a chronic beat and<br/>over the outdoor singing.&quot;</p><p>For the first movement: &quot;Cadenza of bells and boys shouts.&quot;<br/>(Makes you think of Stockhausen&apos;s _Gesang der J&uuml;nglinge_.)<br/>Or this: &quot;1st Sonata IV Â— 1st theme and development.

Mr. Wright!&quot;</p><p>Here is idea passing through idiomatic language to the point<br/>of metamorphosis into musical idiom.</p><p>Ives heard that conventional music played in conventional<br/>harmony had gone flat. &quot;Old Joe is a supreme musician,&quot; he<br/>heard his father say. &quot;Look into his face and hear the music<br/>of the ages. Don&apos;t pay too much attention to the sounds.<br/>If you do, you may miss the music. You won&apos;t get a heroic<br/>ride to heaven on pretty little sounds.&quot; Ives took this<br/>teaching to himself; he also paid attention to the sounds.<br/>He didn&apos;t think the sounds so important in themselves as for<br/>what they could convey. He set out to put &quot;Old Joe&quot; at the<br/>center of his music. Having started out this way he wasn&apos;t<br/>long discovering that simple triads, written to cross at<br/>irregular places and, so to speak, violate their harmony,<br/>also extend the harmony. The ear goes looking for the harmony<br/>and finds it by a more extreme reach. Thus the power of<br/>Ives&apos;s early composition for voices, the _67th Psalm_.</p><p>Going ahead in this way Ives discovered by anticipation<br/>every major development of 20th century music, except<br/>the formal tone-row, which would not have been likely<br/>to hold his interest, though I have read that in one of<br/>his compositions, prophetically entitled _Tone Roads_,<br/>composed around or before the time of _Pierrot Lunaire_<br/>[Comment from Monzo: a full decade before Schoenberg ever<br/>wrote &quot;12-tone&quot; music], he does begin with a full 12-tone<br/>row. Neither Ives nor Schoenberg stopped to figure out<br/>that if you put together Schubert&apos;s melody with Beethoven&apos;s<br/>harmony and Bach&apos;s counterpoint, you must either extend<br/>your composition to &quot;Heavenly lengths,&quot; arriving at the<br/>impasse of Bruckner and Mahler, or something will have to<br/>give. Consider the origins of Schoenberg&apos;s First Quartet:<br/>the style from Brahms, the harmony from Wagner, the unitary<br/>form from Liszt&apos;s Piano Sonata in B minor, and one of the<br/>two exposition sections modeled after the exposition of<br/>Beethoven&apos;s Third Symphony. (These attributions refer to<br/>a taped talk by Schoenberg to accompany a performance of<br/>the First Quartet.) By the Second Quartet everything had<br/>changed, the style, the harmony, the form, the imitation;<br/>in the last movement atonality enters. Or hear Webern&apos;s<br/>early Piano Quintet [Comment from Monzo: from 1907; a small<br/>MIDI excerpt is on my &quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;<br/>webpage], the fragments of authentic Webern like minute<br/>bits of living tissue among the dead stretches of imitation<br/>Brahms.</p><p>What gave in each case was not the formality of the writing<br/>or the solidity of form in the composition but the theory<br/>which required that melody, harmony, and counterpoint must<br/>follow certain rules of combining that would no longer work.<br/>Schoenberg used his ideas first and theorized about them<br/>afterwards. Ives simply went ahead and put his ideas to use.<br/>Schoenberg paid Ives the tribute, incorrectly, of thinking<br/>him a free spirit. Neither of them was altogether free, not<br/>that free, because each knew that what he had done was right<br/>and was convinced that what he had done must be accepted.<br/>Fame and success were not what they wanted: Schoenberg was<br/>celebrated from his 50th birthday; Ives made a big success<br/>and reputation in the insurance business. Each was convinced<br/>that what he had given would some day be received in the<br/>spirit he had given it. We know that it has been and will be.</p><p>The more you become acquainted with great composers, dead<br/>and alive, the more you learn that music is for them a<br/>spiritual as well as a technical experience. Ives wrote<br/>canons as enthusiastically as Schoenberg, but like Beethoven&apos;s<br/>fugues, they go wandering off into their own dimensions.<br/>The technical authority is always being turned aside by<br/>the spiritual. Small minds have laughed at Schoenberg<br/>because he acknowledged such spiritual guidance. See how<br/>this deep vein runs through the music by Stravinsky.</p><p>If Ives is the great source of American experimental music,<br/>Schoenberg contributed the more directly towards pushing<br/>some of the best experimental composers in that direction.<br/>Schoenberg himself remained in the European tradition to<br/>the end.</p><p>Someone may be objecting: you say these American composers<br/>are experimental: how about Schoenberg? how about Bart&oacute;k<br/>and Stravinsky?</p><p>Let&apos;s go back again into history. From 1600 down to<br/>Schoenberg, on the one line, and to Bart&oacute;k and Stravinsky<br/>on the other, European music has been split between two<br/>opposing attitudes about the proper relation between<br/>consonance and dissonance. The difference has fussed up<br/>all the rules of correct composition, without ever being<br/>clarified. The Meantone tradition, which became the German<br/>tradition, took dissonance Â— not discordance Â— as a proper<br/>extension of consonance in harmony and eventually made<br/>abstract drama of it in the sonata. [Comment by Monzo:<br/>note Yates&apos;s distinction between &quot;dissonance&quot; and<br/>&quot;discordance&quot;.  I&apos;m not entirely sure what he means, but<br/>it&apos;s noteworthy because we&apos;ve done the same here recently.]<br/>Bach&apos;s counterpoint is always verging towards the same<br/>dissonance that finally burst into the open in Beethoven&apos;s<br/>Great Fugue. Schoenberg came at the end, when the<br/>dissonance implicit in the German tradition finally won<br/>out over consonance.</p><p>This German tradition seems to us today the mainstream of<br/>European music, but it wasn&apos;t, not until well into the<br/>mid-19th century. The other tradition, now so hidden behind<br/>a slope of history that we can scarcely see it, came down<br/>from Palestrina and Just Intonation. This was the Italian<br/>tradition, which later merged with the French. In this<br/>tradition dissonance was held to be no more than a relish,<br/>a spice, for consonance. Dissonance for its own sake was<br/>to be excluded. That is why this tradition produced few<br/>successful sonatas. (There is of course the distinctively<br/>Italian sonata, of which Domenico Scarlatti produced so<br/>many fascinating variants, strongly consonant compositions<br/>often in unusual key colors, spiced by sharp dissonance.<br/>These were probably in Well Tempered or, as Wesley Kuhnle<br/>has demonstrated, in Meantone tuning adjusted to the<br/>disposition of the piece.)</p><p>The authority of the Italian tradition established what<br/>is known as &quot;formal counterpoint,&quot; the counterpoint taught<br/>at the Conservatory which nobody uses. This counterpoint<br/>is said to have been worked out by Italian theorists on<br/>the model of Palestrina; it paid no attention to what had<br/>happened afterwards by changes in tuning. It assumed a<br/>harmony derived from perfect intervallic ratios, although<br/>every musician knows he works with intervals that are<br/>imperfect. Since this tradition couldn&apos;t go back to Just<br/>Intonation and could use the expressive dissonance of<br/>Meantone only for emotional coloration, its rationale<br/>thrust ahead, as Rameau regretfully foresaw, to Equal<br/>Temperament. Thus practical harmonists substituted a<br/>harmony based on equally imperfect intervallic ratios<br/>for an harmonic theory based on unequal hut perfect ratios,<br/>and tried to (10 this impossibility without changing any<br/>of the rules. Exemplars of this tradition are the great<br/>formal harmonists, Rameau, Cluck, Handel, from whom came<br/>the formal colorists, Berlioz, Liszt, Debussy, and the<br/>simpler melodists, from Pergolesi to Gounod. (Recall how<br/>intensely Berlioz, who avoided the keyboard, disliked Bach?<br/>Or Stendhal&apos;s strictures against German music in favor of<br/>Pergolesi?)</p><p>This anti-dissonant theory reached full display in the<br/>_Gradus ad Parnassum_ of Clementi. Who today has read<br/>through the four volumes of Clementi&apos;s _Gradus_? When<br/>Rossini was reckoned greater than Beethoven, Clementi&apos;s<br/>_Gradus_ and Cherubini&apos;s fugues furnished the models of<br/>counterpoint. Clementi&apos;s _Gradus_ is the graveyard of<br/>Italian formal counterpoint. The ghost haunted European<br/>music for another century. Seen in this relationship<br/>there is nothing strange about Bart&oacute;k turning from Brahms<br/>to Liszt and Debussy, or Stravinsky seeming to overvalue<br/>Gounod or Glinka or Pergolesi, nor in the sudden reversal<br/>of the fundamentally consonant bias of this music into<br/>relatively strict polyharmony. Throughout Stravinsky&apos;s<br/>career he has never swerved from his dislike of German<br/>Expressionism, his preference for _ordonnance_ instead<br/>of the German tendency to submerge beat and accent within<br/>expressive rhythm. (Remember that critical fallacy of a<br/>few years ago, that there is not rhythm in Schoenberg,<br/>but Stravinsky is the very model of good rhythm?) Even<br/>in his latest work, since he has come under the inspiration<br/>of Schoenberg and Webern, Stravinsky has not changed in<br/>those essentials which distinguish his craftsmanship in<br/>every period. He would naturally prefer Webern to<br/>Schoenberg.</p><p>Stravinsky first heard his Septet read through by a group<br/>of musicians at my home. At the end, jumping to his feet,<br/>characteristically, he exclaimed: &quot;It is tonal Â— fiercely<br/>tonal!&quot; His ear had heard what his will would not yet<br/>accept, that only the closing cadences of each section<br/>can be accepted by the ear as tonality. Not many years<br/>later Stravinsky&apos;s insistent honesty spoke, in a recorded<br/>conversation with Robert Craft, the epitaph of the Italian<br/>tradition of pure formal harmony.</p><p>&quot;Harmony, a doctrine dealing with chords and chord relations,<br/>has had a brilliant but short history... Today harmonic<br/>novelty is at an end. As a means of musical construction,<br/>harmony offers no further resources in which to inquire and<br/>from which to seek profit. The contemporary ear and brain<br/>require a completely different approach to music. It is one<br/>of nature&apos;s ways that we often feel closer to distant<br/>generations than to the generation immediately preceding us.<br/>Therefore, the present generation&apos;s interests are directed<br/>to music before the &grave;harmonic age.&apos; Rhythm, rhythmic<br/>polyphony, melodic or intervallic construction are the<br/>elements of musical building to he explored today.&quot;<br/>Stravinsky was thinking, as we know, of the new European<br/>academicism, symbolized by Webern, typified by Pierre<br/>Boulez.</p><p>Ives had come there first and long before, with a reach far<br/>beyond the theoretical confines and justifications of Boulez.<br/>Before any other 20th century composer Ives had broken the<br/>grip of the keyboard, which had governed the layout of all<br/>European music during the 300 year harmonic period. The<br/>finale of his Second Symphony piles up a polyphony of<br/>obbligato voices with the freedom of the 15th century<br/>Flemings. They used their popular tunes, which are foreign<br/>to us; Ives used our popular tunes.</p><p>It is in the First Piano Sonata that Ives most<br/>convincingly, writing for the piano, liberates that<br/>instrument from its long-established conventions. And<br/>he does this directly from the instrument, appealing to<br/>no authority, no more than hinting at any tradition,<br/>seeking above all Â— unlike Boulez Â— no external or<br/>theoretical justification. The Second Sonata, the more<br/>famous Concord Sonata, is structured of continuous<br/>variation. Continuous variation, not the tone-row,<br/>was the principle of composition Schoenberg was to<br/>recommend.</p><p>One device, the tone-cluster, introduced in the First<br/>Sonata and expanded in the Second, was taken up later<br/>by Henry Cowell and borrowed from him by Bart&oacute;k, who<br/>acknowledged his first use of it in a letter to Cowell.<br/>This may have been the first backward transmittal from<br/>American Experimentalism to Europe. Later transmittals,<br/>setting loose new theoretical developments in Europe,<br/>have come from Edgard Var&egrave;se and John Cage.</p><p>Ives freed himself in harmony by accepting as equally<br/>valid any combination of tones which would sound to his<br/>purpose. He did not offer a formula to escape key harmony;<br/>he emancipated dissonance and consonance together and<br/>exercised the privilege. The extraordinarily dissonant<br/>Second Quartet is never wry or discordant. The body of<br/>its sound is richly ample, its speech an idiomatic unity.<br/>The one agreement among nearly all who hear and discuss<br/>the music of Ives is this: however arrived at, the music<br/>sounds as Ives wished. Growing experience refutes the<br/>nibbling criticism that his music is primitive, that it<br/>is badly orchestrated, that Ives might have written better<br/>had he heard his music performed. As a boy Ives had<br/>performed publicly major works by Bach and Mendelssohn;<br/>he had received the best musical education America could<br/>provide. He would most likely have written worse, if he<br/>had not been prevented by his isolation from hearing his<br/>music performed; he might not unreasonably have tried to<br/>adapt his work to immediate use. We are the gainers by<br/>his unbroken isolation. For we are able to hear in his<br/>art not only the liberated tonality, a transcendence of<br/>tonalities rather than an atonality, but also Â— and this<br/>is equally important Â— the origins of subsequent<br/>percussion and noise music.</p><p>The American Experimental Tradition begins in Ives and<br/>finds there the full armory of its equipment, lacking<br/>only the electronic medium. For our Webern we have Carl<br/>Ruggles, never satisfied, forever working over and<br/>rewriting his few compositions. I am not going to recite<br/>the whole of the Tradition, Cowell, Riegger, and the<br/>other rugged individuals. I am simply discovering it<br/>and leaving the details for others to work out. If I<br/>have left some questions, I assure you these are worth<br/>looking into.</p><p>Now for a coda, a few remarks about Edgard Var&egrave;se and John Cage.</p><p>Var&egrave;se came to a new blooming during 1960 with the appearance<br/>of a record including the best of his varied compositions<br/>of the 1920s. These are not many, but they are distinguished<br/>by a search for types of tonal and extra-tonal sound that<br/>have come to fruition in his new works for electronic means.<br/>In _Deserts_ the flesh and tissues of the European symphony<br/>take a running jump out of the old formal skeleton into a<br/>new structure as seemingly free as it is still essentially<br/>symphonic. Var&egrave;se is now deeply engaged in his own sound<br/>laboratory composing new works, of which his _Electronic Poem_,<br/>composed for the Le Corbusier designed Philips Building at<br/>the Brussels Exposition is a foretaste. Var&egrave;se gives credit<br/>for his technical independence to the theoretical writings<br/>of his master, the pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni.<br/>[Comment by Monzo: Busoni was also featured prominently<br/>in my lecture.]  In the work of Var&egrave;se, who alone of the<br/>American Experimentalists was born and nurtured in Europe,<br/>the old tradition has transformed itself idiomatically into<br/>the new language.</p><p>Var&egrave;se would deny that he is an experimentalist: the<br/>experiments, he says, have all been made before I composed.<br/>He said to me: &quot;I&apos;m not interested in tuning. I am able<br/>to invent and produce by electronic means any sound I wish.&quot;</p><p>Partch works with a very large and subtle scale, which<br/>includes for practical purposes the entire overtone series.<br/>[Comment by Monzo: the doors to debate on that one are now<br/>wide open!]</p><p>Harrison nowadays retunes the 12-tone scale to approximate<br/>the acoustical normality of a correct Just Intonation.  His<br/>later works in Equal Temperament were designed to reduce<br/>and as nearly as possible eliminate the factors of<br/>dissonance and modulation. He is no less capable of drawing<br/>polyphony out of arbitrarily pitched objects, for example<br/>the one pound coffee cans, the six flowerpots, the washtub,<br/>the string bass laid on its back and beaten with small<br/>hammers each side of the bridge, all to be found in his<br/>Concerto for violin and percussion. He discovered many<br/>years ago that the overtones of a one pound coffee can<br/>combine well with the upper partials of the violin. [Comment<br/>by Monzo: the concert at which I met John Cage in 1979<br/>featured his &quot;Constructions in Metal&quot;, whose ensembles<br/>include these very coffee cans.]  The beaten recumbent<br/>bass furnishes an antiphony to the violin, just as in<br/>Harrison&apos;s Suite for violin, piano, and small orchestra<br/>the tack-piano supplies a tonal medium between<br/>piano-harp-celesta and the bowed instruments.</p><p>No use trying to pretend that any one of these composers<br/>writes as he does because he could not learn to write<br/>conventionally. He writes as he does because he can&apos;t<br/>write conventionally; because the spirit will not let<br/>him rest in the convention. This sort of side-of-the-mouth<br/>gossip began very early about John Cage. I&apos;ve known John<br/>for 20 years: our first meeting turned into a fight, over<br/>that same question in rhythm in Schoenberg and Stravinksy,<br/>and we&apos;ve been disagreeing ever since. Yet I have never<br/>been so overwhelmed by the sense of absolute rightness<br/>in the development of a composer as when I first played<br/>through the album of John Cage&apos;s 25-year retrospective<br/>concert at Town Hall in May &apos;58. His theories seem usually<br/>unpromising and are usually as right as Webern&apos;s. Granted<br/>that there may have been false starts not represented in<br/>the picked company of the album. I presented John twice<br/>playing his music for prepared piano, but I could never<br/>get the hang of his piece for prepared quartet. I doubted<br/>until I heard it that the music by chance could be other<br/>than arid. Yet I listened to his Concert for piano and<br/>orchestra with a feeling of almost rapturous expansion.</p><p>I don&apos;t buy the argument that what Cage does may be<br/>interesting but it isn&apos;t music. I&apos;ve quoted several times<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s comment to me about Cage: &quot;He is not a<br/>composer, but an inventor Â— of genius.&quot; I have a different<br/>term: I call Cage&apos;s works &quot;esthetic instances.&quot; They are<br/>like philosophical assumptions with which to proceed:<br/>one works with them to determine not whether they are<br/>wrong or right but the consequence. You don&apos;t evaluate<br/>a geodesic dome by saying it isn&apos;t a work of art or a house.<br/>John Cage&apos;s _Imaginary Landscape No. 1_, using the sine<br/>curve of pure fundamental tone from a telephone company<br/>testing record and composed directly on a record, is the<br/>first example of what is now called, clumsily, _Musique<br/>concr&egrave;te_, and of composition by electronic means. Cage<br/>also composed the first work directly on tape, another<br/>_Imaginary Landscape_. With Lou Harrison he brought to<br/>performance the new medium of non-orchestral percussion,<br/>in which Harrison has been especially prolific.</p><p>Cage stated to me the converse of Harrison&apos;s argument:<br/>that Schoenberg, when he emancipated the dissonance,<br/>should have gone farther and emancipated music from its<br/>notes. Therefore the prepared piano and the other prepared<br/>media, the compositions for percussion, the piece for<br/>12 radios, the arbitrarily combined noises of _Williams<br/>Mix_ and the many possible free fantasias of noise made<br/>sensitive by intermingling of _Fontana Mix_. Once the idea<br/>has been established that sounds Â— or events Â— may be<br/>combined in any number of arbitrary combinations, subject<br/>to rules determined for the occasion Â— and Cage has gone<br/>a long way towards demonstrating its vitality, regardless<br/>of whether you call the combinations random chance or<br/>just ordinary chance Â— then we are at the point of setting<br/>foot ashore in a new creative landscape. And why not!</p><p>If some readers have been bruised by what they may think<br/>my extreme chauvinism, let me go farther. American music<br/>being written today, both experimental and academic, is<br/>the equal of the best that is being written anywhere.<br/>There is perhaps too much of it, but that is no reason<br/>why it should not be estimated by the best. Its multifarious<br/>theories are as stimulating as any to be found abroad.<br/>Few Americans have yet shown courage to esteem the flowering<br/>American musical creation as highly as it deserves among<br/>the flourishing older musical cultures. It is time to do so.</p><p>--------</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21280 href="#21280">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/19/2001 8:28:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m really sorry for the totally inexcusable length<br/>&gt; of this post</p><p>No you&apos;re not! :)</p><p>Glad to see you&apos;ve discovered the wealth of insight to be found in<br/>Peter Yates writings.
