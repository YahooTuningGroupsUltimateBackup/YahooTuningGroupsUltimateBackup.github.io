How do I tune my Pro-52 synthesizer with Scala? I read the manual and it told me to set synth to 111 or 113 and then type <a href="https://twitter.com/send">@send</a>. I&apos;ve tried every midi port and midi option and am still getting dorayme. What am I missing?</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2003 3:43:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David Black wrote:<br/>&gt;How do I tune my Pro-52 synthesizer with Scala?

What am I missing?</p><p>Scala doesn&apos;t send midi to the synth directly in order to tune it.<br/>Instead, it creates a midi file and needs a midi file player to send the<br/>data. If the installation went right, you would see Megamid appear on<br/>the screen when you do <a href="https://twitter.com/send">@send</a>. But Megamid&apos;s output device needs to be set<br/>first (click the setup button). You can also start Megamid from Scala<br/>with the command &quot;spawn megamid&quot;.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
