Ron M. George--an Appreciation<br/>   Posted by: &quot;Heidi Lesemann&quot; <a href="mailto:heidimusic@verizon.net">heidimusic@verizon.net</a>     Date: Mon Oct 16, 2006 8:56 pm (PDT)</p><p>*RON M. GEORGE, 1937-2006: An Appreciation*</p><p>A celebration of Ron&apos;s life will be held at Inner City Arts October 22 at 4:30pm</p><p>It is with great sadness that ACF-LA announces to our membership that Ron George, percussionist, composer, inventor of percussion instruments, educator, ACF member, dear friend and colleague has passed away unexpectedly in his studio at the end of September.</p><p>Ron was an international performing and recording artist and inventor of original percussion instruments. He developed a notation system for both traditional and new percussion instruments and taught his interactive &quot;Creative Music Program&quot; for children and youth at Inner-City Arts. Ron conducted workshops throughout the United States and taught at Cal Arts, The Idyllwild School of Music, and the LA County High School for the Arts. He is a COLA Grant recipient from LA City Department of Cultural Affairs. His joy in creating, imagining and performing was one of the greatest gifts he brought to bear in his teaching of young students. His love for them was unconditional, and the students responded to the way he modeled the relationship of an artist to his art and surroundings.</p><p>Ron was a central figure in the American Composers Forum/LA: ACF/LA awarded him a Subito grant in 2001 for a video documentation of his work. He received two ACF/LA grants to work with students in three of our pilot music projects. He was extraordinarily effective in all programs. In addition, he provided his extensive experience in Music Education to the ACF-LA Education Committee&iuml;&iquest;&half;which he founded-- as well as consultation on all our community programs involving children. He represented our organization helping children make music at a Family Day sponsored by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Ron was one of the first composers to participate in &quot;Composers Suitcase,&quot; a pilot project for the second grade and one of the Demonstration Projects in Arts Education funded by the California Arts Council. His work with these young students was focused on music improvisation and composition through the fascinating American Gamelan, his own invention and creation. His preparation of the students demonstrated his ability as a true educator as well as his ability as an artist and composer. When the students approached the Gamelan, they did so with a sense of confidence and excitement. He presented one of the most successful residencies in our experience.</p><p>Ron also worked in a collaborative, interdisciplinary Arts program at the Poseidon School for at-risk students in an ACF-LA pilot program that integrated Music and Drama. The program culminated in the public performance of a newly-created, interdisciplinary work at the 24th Street Theater. By using his American Gamelan and percussion instruments, he gave students the success they so feared, and recognized talent in students who had no idea they were gifted. The artistic quality of the final performance was very high, and their enhanced ability to work together with respect for one another shone in the success of their performance.</p><p>Ron&iuml;&iquest;&half;s generosity in sharing his experience with others has enhanced music education programs in a variety of school, after school, and weekend programs, in community and in school settings. Combining his concern for youth with his artistic abilities, he has made a difference to countless school children throughout his artistic career.</p><p>Ron was born on April 22, 1937 in Escondido, California. He received his MM from Indiana University, and his MA in Music at University of California, San Diego. .</p><p>You will find out much more at Ron&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Web site: <a href="http://www.ronmgeorge.com">http://www.ronmgeorge.com</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.ronmgeorge.com/">http://www.ronmgeorge.com/</a>&gt;.</p><p>The following announcement was sent out by Inner-City Arts.
