Take any two tones, either harmonics or<br/>fundamentals, that are actually present in the sound you&apos;re trying to<br/>produce. Take either the sum or the difference of the frequencies. That is<br/>one of the combinational tones. All the extra tones you are seeing are<br/>probably combinational tones of this kind (quadratic), but some may be cubic<br/>combinational tones (the sum or difference between a quadratic combinational<br/>tones and one of the original tones), or quartic combinational tones . . .<br/>You would need to repeat the experiment with pure sine waves to be sure.</p><p>Combinational tones such as these are often produced by faulty sound<br/>reproduction or equipment. The &quot;THD&quot; (Total Harmonic Distortion) rating on<br/>amplification equipment measures the degree to which these &quot;extra&quot; tones are<br/>produced. Driving an amplifier or speaker too hard is another common cause<br/>of combinational tones. When subjected to loud volumes, the ear produces<br/>&quot;subjective&quot; combinational tones, though sum tones are noticeably absent and<br/>one cubic difference tone is anomalously loud for low-volume stimuli . . .</p><p>In your example, call the lower tone a and the upper tone b. They start at 2<br/>and 4 times some frequency, and move up to 3 and 8 times that frequency.<br/>(The lines are slightly curved since a linear rise in cents is an<br/>exponential in frequency.) So:</p><p>a = 2--&gt;3<br/>b = 4--&gt;8</p><p>So the lines you see are:</p><p>0--&gt;0  (a-a, b-b, etc.)<br/>0--&gt;2  (b-2*a)<br/>0--&gt;4  (2*b-4*a)<br/>2--&gt;1  (3*a-b)<br/>2--&gt;3  (a)<br/>2--&gt;5  (b-a)<br/>2--&gt;7  (2*b-3*a)<br/>4--&gt;4  (2*b-4*a)<br/>4--&gt;6  (2*a)<br/>4--&gt;8  (b)<br/>4--&gt;10 (2*b-2*a)</p><p>etc.</p></div>
