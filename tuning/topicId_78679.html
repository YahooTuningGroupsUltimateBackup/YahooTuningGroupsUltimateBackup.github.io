This means that you<br/>have a physical situation that is initially symmetrical, where the<br/>laws have the same symmetry, but its preferred state (eg least energy)<br/>is actually asymmetrical. Sounds strange? Think of a cone balanced on<br/>its point - the whole situation has rotational symmetry about the<br/>axis, but the final situation will be the cone falling down and<br/>pointing in one direction.</p><p>The symmetry in the case of temperaments is transposition round the<br/>circle of fifths. Only equal temperament(s) respect this symmetry<br/>completely. In fact one can &apos;derive&apos; 12-et by minimizing a function of<br/>the deviations of all fifths and thirds, subject to the condition that<br/>the deviations of 5ths add up to a Pythagorean comma.<br/>Of course this function has to respect the symmetry also, ie it has to<br/>treat all thirds, resp. all fifths, equally round the circle. This is<br/>the analogue of the physical laws having some symmetry.</p><p>But the conclusion of 12-et doesn&apos;t always hold, even if my function<br/>is totally symmetric! Least-squares minimization *does* always give<br/>12-et, that can be proved, because it is a linear problem ...<br/>essentially because the function is simple enough.</p><p>However if I take a different function of the thirds, a strongly<br/>nonlinear (but still transposition-symmetrical) one, I can minimise it<br/>and get an *unequal* temperament!</p><p>How could this work musically? In an unequal temp you have better<br/>thirds and worse thirds, and even if you play them equally often, it<br/>should give a &apos;better&apos; result than having all thirds the same. This<br/>means that beyond a certain amount of impurity, increasing the<br/>deviation should lead to progressively *less* penalty. Basically the<br/>purer thirds should more than compensate for the impurer ones.<br/>Mathematically, this means our function of the third-deviations should<br/>not be convex: it should have bulges on the hillsides, as well as a<br/>central valley around the pure interval.</p><p>I chose a function which is the total over every major third of<br/>Exp(-1/|D3/t|)<br/>where D3 is the deviation in cents and t is a constant. I chose values<br/>of t between 4 and 12, this is an arbitrary choice that models the<br/>point at which an extra deviation starts to become less important...<br/>or the width of the &apos;flood plain&apos; at the bottom of the valley.<br/>Basically smaller t means pickier about the purity of the good thirds.<br/>Then I just add another weight which is the sum of squares of fifth<br/>deviations D5, times a constant &apos;f&apos;, and stick the whole thing into<br/>Mathematica&apos;s numerical minimization routine.</p><p>The thing actually exhibits first-order phase transitions! Given any<br/>value of t, for large values of f (modeling situations where pure<br/>fifths are more desirable) the minimum configuration is 12-et.<br/>But for smaller values, you jump discontinuously to a situation where<br/>fifths on one side of the circle are narrower than ET, and wider on<br/>the other. In other words a classic &apos;Well Tempered&apos; situation - but a<br/>result that dropped out &quot;automatically&quot; from a setup that treated<br/>every key the same!</p><p>Moreover by adjusting &apos;f&apos; and &apos;t&apos; you can model different types of<br/>&apos;historical&apos; circular temperament...</p><p>For example with t=6, f=0.0116 I get the following sequence of fifths:<br/>-3.9,<br/>-4.7,<br/>-7.4,<br/>-4.7,<br/>-3.9,<br/>-2.9,<br/>0.7,<br/>1.6,<br/>1.9,<br/>1.6,<br/>0.7,<br/>-2.9<br/>a strongly unequal modified meantone.</p><p>With t=12, f=0.0115 I get<br/>-3.6,<br/>-4.4,<br/>-4.4,<br/>-3.6,<br/>-2.5,<br/>-1.2,<br/>-0.4,<br/>0.0,<br/>0.0,<br/>-0.4,<br/>-1.2,<br/>-2.5,<br/>which is a WT very much like &apos;Young I&apos;.</p><p>But for t=12, f=0.012 I get 12et again...</p><p>There are further phase transitions between results with *one* single<br/>best (and worst) M3, and results with *two* equally best (or worst)<br/>M3&apos;s, but I&apos;ll spare you further details just now.<br/>It was some time ago that I thought some sort of SSB for temperaments<br/>should be possible, I&apos;m quite pleased that it turned out to work<br/>rather quickly.<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=78681 href="#78681">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2008 3:38:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; There are further phase transitions between results with *one* single<br/>&gt; best (and worst) M3, and results with *two* equally best (or worst)<br/>&gt; M3&apos;s, but I&apos;ll spare you further details just now.<br/>&gt; It was some time ago that I thought some sort of SSB for temperaments<br/>&gt; should be possible, I&apos;m quite pleased that it turned out to work<br/>&gt; rather quickly.<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;</p><p>Great work.
