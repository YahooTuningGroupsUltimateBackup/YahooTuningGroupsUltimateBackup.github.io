More<br/>than 15 years ago I started using what I called &quot;folding fingers&quot; in<br/>12-EDO, an interweaving tetrachord approach I gleaned from a &apos;50s<br/>Bulgarian textbook and a deep conversation with a very stoned and<br/>talented rock guitarist, who used a similar idea in soloing. As far<br/>as I can make out, the basic idea is the same as Bill&apos;s &quot;nested<br/>(x)chords&quot;, and the whole approach is melody-based: harmony can be<br/>downright accidental in heterophony.</p><p>Of course this approach leads straight into alternative tuning; just<br/>hunting for information on tetrachords in a library will inevitably<br/>cause you to stumble on the ancient Greeks for example.</p><p>As far as Bill&apos;s humorously offensive approach, it doesn&apos;t bother me<br/>a bit. For one thing, artistic debate in some cultures has a whole<br/>different set of rules. For another, I had one of the &quot;famous<br/>composers&quot; listed on the title page of this group as a teacher,<br/>years ago, and that person was, by my standards, a very uptight<br/>square- in some ways a truly great teacher, in other ways... :-)<br/>Personally, I say let every artist say what they think, we&apos;ll take<br/>it with humor.</p><p>Triadic thinking is just dandy, certainly a great deal of wonderful<br/>music has been made that way. However, it is ONE approach, not THE<br/>approach. Because &quot;harmony&quot; and &quot;triadic harmony&quot; tend to get<br/>confused, I think I can see what irks Bill.</p><p>But! Bill, if the &quot;orthodox alternative tuning establishment&quot; is<br/>represented on this list, exclusively &quot;harmonic&quot; approaches are NOT<br/>the only things going on, and certainly not exclusively triad-<br/>fixated thinking (otherwise I wouldn&apos;t be here). If you read, for<br/>example, George Secor and Margo Schulter&apos;s papers, you&apos;ll find not<br/>only melodic concerns as a main force, but the actual roots of the<br/>triad before it became a reified cartoon of itself in mainstream<br/>Western music. And the whole subsets-of-giant-EDOs thing isn&apos;t just<br/>a way of approximating harmonic intervals, but also a way of seeking<br/>structural integrity in the melodic realm. The &quot;Eastern<br/>Contingent&quot; :-) here is superb when it comes to melodic approaches<br/>to tuning- I doubt that they realize how liberating and inspiring<br/>they are by simply doing their thing.</p><p>Anyway carry on.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Flavell&quot; &lt;musictheorybill@&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MelodyCentricAlternativeTuningSy">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MelodyCentricAlternativeTuningSy</a><br/>ste<br/>&gt; &gt; ms/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Outside of the typo/linebreak, which should read:<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MelodyCentricAlternativeTuningSy">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MelodyCentricAlternativeTuningSy</a><br/>stems/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bill neglects to include the first sentence, from his mission<br/>&gt; statement for the group:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;A group for composers, music theorists, and/or musicians who are<br/>&gt; interested in my melody-centric approach to the design of<br/>alternative<br/>&gt; non-12TET tuning systems, as opposed to the psychopathologically<br/>&gt; harmony-centric approach of the orthodox alternative tuning<br/>&gt; establishment.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I guess I&apos;m either insulted, he missed my melodies, or my<br/>&gt; occupations now include PsychoPathologist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=68360 href="#68360">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2006 4:45:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Triadic thinking is just dandy, certainly a great deal of wonderful<br/>&gt; music has been made that way.
