Presumably there would<br/>be an ensemble to perform the composition<br/>once it was finished, so it was necessary to<br/>produce a finished score in ink, and to<br/>copy all the parts by hand for each instrument</p><p>I distinctly remember sharing many all-night<br/>copying sessions with fellow composers near<br/>the end of the academic year, using a real<br/>old-fashioned fountain pen, and erasing by<br/>carefully scratching the wrong note off the<br/>paper with a razor blade.</p><p>When I was composing this way, living in<br/>New York, there were several places a composer<br/>could go with a finished score and parts<br/>written on &quot;proofs&quot; - thin semi-transparent<br/>paper.  These places would then print and<br/>bind the score and parts (for a few dollars,<br/>of course), and you&apos;d be ready to start<br/>rehearsals. (jeez, sounds like ancient history)<br/>Quite a bit more involved than simply pressing<br/>the &quot;play&quot; and &quot;print&quot; buttons.</p><p>Something Rick mentioned that I&apos;d like to<br/>emphasize was the need for *quiet*.  In today&apos;s<br/>MIDI- and PC-based world of composing, it&apos;s<br/>usually a much more hands-on approach: you sit<br/>down with your instrument(s), plug in, and<br/>you&apos;re off, storing it on your hard drive<br/>as you go.</p><p>Back then, composing for me meant finding<br/>a quiet place (my favorite was in the park),<br/>sitting down with paper and pencil, and<br/>taking the sounds out of my head and<br/>putting them on paper.  It required<br/>a great deal of ear-training (for those of<br/>us without absolute pitch!) to be able to<br/>compose without playing an instrument.<br/>I suppose this is partly why I have a fondness<br/>for such fine discrimination in pitch these days.</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=1445 href="#1445">ðŸ”—</a>Lewis_Jimmy@xx.xxxxxx.xxxx.xxx</h3><span>3/9/1999 7:36:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for your descriptions.
