Dave Benson mentions Harrison&apos;s 24-note<br/>tuning in his &quot;Mathematics and Music&quot; lecture notes but shows it<br/>comprised of 34 notes vice 24 (I think Dr. Benson made an error.)<br/>Thanks for your time and comment.</p></div><h3><a id=52855 href="#52855">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2004 11:32:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ham_45242&quot; &lt;arl_123@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello, all.
