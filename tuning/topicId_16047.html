It appeared in connection with<br/>the Stern-Brocot tree. That definition of (purely mathematical) complexity<br/>(a*b) was due to Pierre Lamothe.</p><p>It may also be due to Denny Genovese. In my spreadsheet I have &quot;Genovese<br/>DF&quot; calculated as GOF(a)*GOF(b), GOF = Greatest Odd Factor = Remove factors<br/>of 2. But then I have plotted it (or rather it&apos;s square root) on a chart of<br/>octave-specific measures. I seem to remember Carl Lumma told me that<br/>&quot;Genovese DF&quot; was simply a*b. Can anyone clarify this?</p><p>But as far as I know, only Lamothe proved its interesting mathematical<br/>properties in relation to the Stern-Brocot tree (which, I seem to remember,<br/>also happen to translate to musical properties for small integer ratios).</p><p>&gt; I think Dave K. is getting at the idea that there are three factors<br/>&gt; which determine the consonance/dissonance of an interval,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; complexity<br/>&gt; tolerance<br/>&gt; span</p><p>I wasn&apos;t, but it&apos;s always good to keep in mind. Especially what Monz fails<br/>to mention in his dictionary, that harmonic complexity measures are only<br/>intended to approximate dissonance in the case of _simple_ ratios narrower<br/>than say two octaves. A ratio with very high complexity can in fact be very<br/>consonant due to being within tolerance of a simple ratio or by being wide.</p><p>And what about the (admittedly minor) effect of &quot;rootedness&quot;.</p><p>&gt; and I think I&apos;ve convinced Dave K. that, in this context, Tenney&apos;s<br/>&gt; complexity, or a monotonic function of it such as a*b, is the best<br/>&gt; measure of complexity.</p><p>Yes. But I&apos;ll rephrase it. You&apos;ve convinced me that Lamothe complexity, or<br/>a monotonic function of it such as Tenney&apos;s harmonic distance, is the best<br/>measure of harmonic complexity for dyads.</p><p>&gt; And I was led there by Graham Breed. So perhaps we<br/>should<br/>&gt; call a*b the Tenney/Breed/Erlich/Keenan complexity or something,<br/>just to<br/>&gt; avoid confusing with Wilson&apos;s harmonic complexity or other<br/>functions.</p><p>I propose that henceforth &quot;complexity&quot; without qualification be understood<br/>as Lamothe complexity (a*b) since this is the only one that can<br/>legitimately drop the adjective &quot;harmonic&quot;, and is also the most reliable<br/>for ranking the disonance of narrow-to-medium-span simple-ratio dyads.</p><p>I too am convinced that there is no audible effect or affect due to the<br/>introduction of ratios with a new prime factor. I hear that ratios of 9 are<br/>as distinct from ratios of 3 as they are from ratios of 5 and 7. One<br/>possible reason for this confusion is that it is extremely difficult to<br/>construct a scale that allows accurate ratios of 3 without also allowing<br/>ratios of 9.</p><p>I believe the &quot;prime&quot; distinction is another example of a supposed musical<br/>distinction which is in fact, purely mathematical. I did not come to that<br/>conclusion easily. You may remember I tried various prime-weighting schemes<br/>to preserve it in the face of what I was hearing. In the end, the mere size<br/>of the numbers was enough to explain everything.</p><p>Here is another possible reason for the confusion:</p><p>It is a mathematical fact that, of two numbers of similar size, the number<br/>that has the smaller prime factors (and hence has _more_ factors) will form<br/>_more_ simple ratios with other numbers. This is because it has more<br/>factors that may cancel. But this does not affect the fact that the<br/>consonance of any such simple ratio is dependent only on the _size_ of the<br/>numbers when the ratio is expressed in lowest terms (plus the other<br/>non-prime related factors mentioned above).</p><p>Primeness is inaudible, and if the exponents (number of times each prime<br/>may occur as a factor) are not limited, then it is also immeasurable. If<br/>anyone claims that despite being inaudible, limited-exponent primeness has<br/>a subliminal effect on some listeners, then it is their responsibility do<br/>demonstrate this by suitable experiments.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
