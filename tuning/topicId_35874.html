Keyboards and<br/>temperament problematics in general use the tonal space: a set of absolute pitches in which tonic<br/>and scales are transposed. The gammiers use simply the modal space. Unison is priviledged in the<br/>modal space, in sense it&apos;s a monovalent degree, but it&apos;s not a limitation to choose any key as tonic,<br/>so there&apos;s not a physical hole around the tonic on the keyboard, but a virtual modal hole around the<br/>unison.</p><p>Besides, there are solid arguments to limit the amount of intervals used in music, but it appears to<br/>me circonstantial that pitch spaces itself be limited. Technology progress could change that: tonic<br/>changes, tonal translations, fifth cycles, modal transformations, tempered derives, all that were more<br/>or less coupled in the past, so tonal and modal spaces in representation.</p><p>For the moment, it seems simple to limit the tonic at 72 fixed tempered values, so transpositions be<br/>tempered, but nothing might prevent to use at need, on an adapted instrument, just values defined<br/>relatively to the momentary tonic (even if few could hear the difference between just and tempered).</p><p>Paul:<br/>  of course, there&apos;s<br/>  nothing wrong with your generalized keyboard design here per se --<br/>  but let&apos;s say we were to give this to joseph pehrson right now . . .<br/>  he uses blackjack and thinks of G as a tonic (0), so the section of<br/>  the keyboard he&apos;d be interested in would be</p><p>  ..................23....30....37....44....51....58....65.....0....7..</p><p>  ..0....7....14....21....28....35....42....49....56....63....70....5..</p><p>  .70....5....12....19.................................................</p><p>  the omission of note 70 (G&lt;) in your diagrams would probably be<br/>  confusing to him and to me,<br/>Well, I had no intention, at this moment to propose a keyboard design, but only to show in one of my<br/>sketch, where I was testing gradient with pdf and swf, a minimum of 4 perceptive illusions in that image.<br/>Since it was question abundantly of perceptive phenomena about the &quot;third&quot;, I wanted only to say that<br/>perceptive illusions are frequent, for vision.

I will show later how I used similar extended 72-matrices to represent, for instance, any<br/>fifth cycle and particularly the Safi al-Din set.

In that case, your<br/>  gammier diagrams may simply belong to the same category as lattices and<br/>  generalized keyboards and only this one happens to be a generalized<br/>  keyboard we&apos;ve already seen.<br/>&quot;Generalized keyboard&quot; has more affinity with tempered approach than gammier approach. It&apos;s only<br/>for particular gammier, like ib1215, where the shrutal treillis gives a compact lattice in tonal-modal<br/>representation, that it becomes interessant to consider that as a possible &quot;generalized keyboard&quot;.</p><p>It suffices then to made an affine transformation: rotation to horizontalize the octave and skew for a<br/>perfect linear projection on x-axis.</p><p>The first page of the pdf attached shows the tonal-modal representation of the shrutal treillis of the<br/>t-gammier which is the 72-tET image of the gammier ib1215. We can see immediately both virtual<br/>&quot;generalized keyboard&quot; and &quot;secor&quot; generator.</p><p>I precise that any gammier has a shrutal treillis. The tonal shruti is the minimal step of the gammier<br/>while the modal shrutis are the unison vectors basis. So in Indian system, the tonal shruti is 256/243<br/>while the modal shrutis are 81/80 and 25/24.</p><p>In the 72-tET image of ib1215, the image of the steps &lt; 22/21  21/20  16/15  15/14  12/11  10/9 &gt; is<br/>[5 5 7 7 9 11] so the tonal shruti is 5 and the unison vectors [0 2 0 2 2], so a unique modal shruti 2,<br/>and thus the shrutal treillis is a regular lattice. More, it&apos;s almost perfectly compact.</p><p>These qualities, compacity and quasi-unicity of modal shruti, are not a logic result of the gammier<br/>axiomatic, and tempered approach on the List has better tools to explain that MIRACLE.</p><p>However, the gammier theory may enlighten the scale interpretation within the MIRACLE zone. The<br/>goal of my graphical project is to exhibit at less all proper substructures of ib1215 and some improper<br/>like japanese, for instance, and ib1215 itself, which has an improprer 11/10 (degree 2) lesser than the<br/>step 10/9.</p><p>Graham:<br/>  To save all subscribers downloading them, it<br/>  would be better to put them on a website. You can have space on mine if<br/>  you don&apos;t have your own.<br/>I have mine but I consider these attached files as temporary. I want eventually write a new website and<br/>I find I have already too much links to keep active. This times yet I attached a pdf but I will try to find a<br/>solution. Maybe a section tuning post on my website.</p><p>Graham:<br/>  Also, you keep posting messages and then<br/>  disappearing before we can start a discussion.<br/>I have difficulty with that, effectively. I take much time to write even in French, so in English it&apos;s terrible.<br/>I&apos;m afraid of past too long discussions. I became stressed and even aggressive with Gene. So I apologize<br/>for that. I want both remain open for discussion but stop before lost energies.</p><p>Graham:<br/>  Do you have links to your other diagrams?<br/>I did&apos;t write on my website since august 2000 but only add material for the tuning Lists. I suggest to wait<br/>my new material. I add to the mentionned shrutal treillis, in the pdf attached, some diagrams among the<br/>testing sketchs I made these days.</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2002 12:39:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Pierre Lamothe&quot; &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m afraid of past too long discussions.

A [h2-v5,h5] system would have (5/50)*1200=120 and (8/50)*1200=192 as generators. You could moot the difference between these systems by adopting a hexagonal array of accordian buttons.</p></div>
