Unless you tell it otherwise.</p><p>Graham is right. If you want middle C to be fixed to 261.63 Hz, you must do<br/>&quot;load/map clinear&quot;. You could add this command to the file startup.cmd if<br/>that&apos;s convenient. The command &quot;show mapping&quot; will show the current<br/>keyboard<br/>mapping.<br/>Maybe this little shift in frequency contributes to the difference in sound<br/>between 31-tone and 1/4-c. meantone that Joseph noticed.<br/>Another thing to try for assessing the influence of the TX81Z tuning<br/>resolution<br/>is trying a different quantisation before sending the scale to the<br/>synthesizer.<br/>The &quot;send&quot; command rounds to the nearest step. But doing<br/>&quot;quantize/best 768&quot; or<br/>&quot;quantize/consistent 768&quot; before sending may yield a different result.<br/>The latter only makes sense for JI scales.<br/>I tried for 19-31.scl and quantize/best gave a different result than<br/>quantize/round. For meanquar_19 it made no difference.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
