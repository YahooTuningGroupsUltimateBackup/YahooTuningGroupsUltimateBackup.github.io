On this particular recording, there is a huge ensemble of<br/>monks playing various instruments of the ritual orchestra, and the<br/>Gyaling is in fact accompanied by the Buhak, Dung, Kangling, Ang and<br/>Dungkar - as well as many percussion instruments. I think you are<br/>correct to say that my measurements would just represent this<br/>isolated performance, where others may yield very different values.<br/>Worthy of mention though, is that it was remarkable how accurately<br/>the intervals were played in the 2 examples I analysized. Thanks<br/>kindly for your scholarly input on this, as this was my first time<br/>ever trying to do this procedure.</p><p>Do you happen to know by what method A.
