But it&apos;s online, which<br/>means anybody anyhwere on any computer can use it.  It&apos;s also easy-to-use<br/>and so it could be good for coding up examples to post on the lists at a<br/>moment&apos;s notice.</p><p>Here it is:</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/micromidi/main.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/micromidi/main.html</a></p><p>There are tutorials online as well.</p><p>The recently posted &quot;Piece for Lou Harrison&quot; was made with this tool.<br/>It&apos;s score is linked to in the tutorial, as an example.</p><p>Enjoy,</p><p>C Bailey</p></div>
