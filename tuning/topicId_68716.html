Bach, which he set by ear?<br/>Are you going to try to say that was Werckmeister III?</p><p>Again, you are overly concerned about these issues, probably more than<br/>Bach would be. You are also not realistic enough about the prospect of<br/>ad-hoc family recipes that served a purpose, that no one in the Bach<br/>family felt the need to write down, probably, because many musicians<br/>had their own pet tunings, and they were all probably close enough to<br/>each other that any ensemble musician could adjust by ear.</p><p>In short, they probably didn&apos;t give a shit enough about tuning.<br/>Otherwise, as it has been said before, we would know very clearly.<br/>Bach took the time to write out ornament tables; if he cared as much<br/>about tuning issues, we&apos;d have some direct info. But we don&apos;t. CPE<br/>Bach was quite vague except to say &apos;temper most fifths&apos;. More than<br/>that, we don&apos;t know.</p><p>Nothing more needs to be said any more about this...it&apos;s getting<br/>really silly. You&apos;ve clearly invested an awful amount of time and<br/>energy into &apos;proving&apos; to yourself and others that Bach was writing for<br/>Werck III---as an experiment, probably worthwhile, but it&apos;s another<br/>thing altogether to make definitive statements and mislead the general<br/>public with strong conclusions when there is nothing but speculation.<br/>The same might be said for Lehman&apos;s work, in a sense. Speculation is<br/>just speculation, not hard fact, and it shouldn&apos;t be turned into fact.</p><p>Otherwise, on the other hand, it&apos;s a good thing you&apos;re out there doing<br/>it, and raising the questions, and performing some great music, so<br/>hats off!</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3><a id=68718 href="#68718">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2007 10:25:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Aaron.

Having failed in this experiment (...)</p><p>This is a very partial summary. If you read the sources you will find<br/>that, running through all the keys, it was *difficult* to distinguish<br/>between the tunings set by J.N. Bach and Neidhardt, until the judges<br/>tried the performance of a bass aria in B flat minor. Not until this<br/>point was it possible to say whose tuning was better.</p><p>Certainly Neidhardt was attempting to set equal temperament by<br/>monochord. However, it is not recorded what temperament J.N. Bach was<br/>using. Neidhardt&apos;s result may have been less than optimal in one or<br/>another key on account of inaccuracies in use of the monochord, or<br/>many other factors. Given the frequency with which B flat minor was<br/>used in practice, the &apos;failure&apos; was scarcely significant.</p><p>We might tentatively deduce that J.N. Bach tuned fairly near to equal<br/>temperament at that contest - otherwise it would have sounded *worse*<br/>than Neidhardt&apos;s near-ET in some keys. One simple possibility is that<br/>JN Bach tuned ET by ear better than Neidhardt did by monochord.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How in the world could anyone claim Neidhardt influenced the tuning<br/>&gt; of J.S. Bach if the above is true?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can&apos;t.</p><p>How can anyone in the world claim that Neidhardt *didn&apos;t* influence<br/>the tuning of J.S. Bach?</p><p>You can&apos;t. Lack of evidence cuts both ways.</p><p>To add to the information presented by Johnny, which only refers to<br/>Neidhardt&apos;s early efforts with ET : Neidhardt later presented many<br/>*irregular* temperament recipes, which he must have developed between<br/>1706 and 1724 or later. Did he get any helpful hints from JN Bach in<br/>preparing them?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or does one need more proof that JS Bach was established in a tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; for life since childhood?</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this question. Where is the first proof, never mind<br/>&apos;one more&apos;? Bach, who checked the tuning of his harpsichords daily,<br/>did so the same way for (say) forty years? That&apos;s 14,400 tunings. Yet<br/>that is what is claimed. &apos;Bach was established in a tuning for life<br/>since childhood&apos;. Just think about what this means and what one would<br/>need to &apos;prove&apos; it.</p><p>Where is one piece of direct evidence as to what Bach did with respect<br/>to tuning harpsichords in his &apos;childhood&apos; (though in 1706 he was<br/>already 21)?</p><p>OK, I stop now. Just to note that it is very easy to select a few<br/>facts out of a huge pile of more or less useful information to &apos;make a<br/>case&apos;. For example, for the Werckmeister 1698 continuo tuning, which<br/>is different from all the 1691 temperaments. This is connected to Bach<br/>in two ways (documented in the Norrback book): one, it was found<br/>copied out in the documents of an organist-composer relation of his;<br/>two, it was also copied into the proceedings of the Leipzig<br/>music-theory society founded by Mizler ...
