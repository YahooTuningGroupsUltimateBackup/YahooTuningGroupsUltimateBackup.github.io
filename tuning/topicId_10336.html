Green wrote:</p><p>&gt; While, I will try not step into this realm of unattractive cynicism<br/>&gt; for now, it is clear to me that whether or not Mr. Duringer&apos;s<br/>&gt; invention enables more sophisticated solo performance may be<br/>&gt; negligible at this time. The public will probably never view this<br/>&gt; invention as anything more than an oddity, as it is an unwaivering<br/>&gt; belief at the moment by the public that the synthesizer does not<br/>&gt; require the same kind of skill, prowess and stellar musicianship<br/>&gt; that a &quot;real instrument played by a real musician does&quot;. Until this<br/>&gt; changes, I am not sure what can be said, since it seems to me the<br/>&gt; &quot;problem&quot; with electronic instruments isn&apos;t the instruments<br/>&gt; themselves.</p><p>Here I&apos;m tempted to reply that in a medieval or Renaissance European<br/>perspective, all instruments other than the human voice (the ideal)<br/>are &quot;artificial instruments&quot; of different kinds.</p><p>In the 16th century, polyphonic instruments such as keyboards are also<br/>known as &quot;perfect instruments&quot; -- that is, instruments capable in<br/>themselves of supplying a &quot;perfect&quot; (or complete) harmony of three or<br/>more voices and intervals at the same time.</p><p>Interestingly, in 1565, Tomas de Santa Maria&apos;s treatise on the art of<br/>composition or improvisation for such instruments was written for<br/>&quot;keyboards, vihuela, harp, and other instruments capable of playing<br/>three, four, or more voices.&quot;</p><p>From this perspective, a polyphonic electronic synthesizer is simply<br/>another form of &quot;perfect instrument.&quot; I tend to consider it a variant<br/>on an organ or harpsichord.</p><p>Generally, playing medieval and Renaissance music on such an<br/>instrument calls for the same kinds of musical decisions as using an<br/>acoustical organ or harpsichord. For example, I ask myself, &quot;Does this<br/>sixth want to be made major before an octave -- and, if so, should I<br/>use Eb or C#?&quot; Whether one is playing on a period instrument or a<br/>microtunable synthesizer, the answer might be different from<br/>performance to performance, and depends on the performer.</p><p>This is also true for a more specialized question of the kind<br/>especially appropriate for this Tuning List: &quot;For this early<br/>15th-century piece, should I play this interval in a 15-note<br/>Pythagorean tuning as A-C# or A-Db?&quot; While Ugolino of Orvieto tells us<br/>that an &quot;intelligent organist&quot; can use a 17-note keyboard to realize<br/>cadences more aptly, how one would use such a keyboard in the<br/>stylistic ambience of this epoch remains an open question. It&apos;s an<br/>area for imagination and the artist&apos;s taste.</p><p>What microtunable synthesizer technology does is to provide a more<br/>accessible basis for such artistic judgment.</p><p>[On tunings with multiple manuals or &quot;ranks&quot; of keys]</p><p>&gt; It would be nice perhaps to be able to figure out some &quot;reliable&quot;<br/>&gt; way to implement it in respect to each tuning by rank in respect to<br/>&gt; an adjacent ranks&apos; tunings, rather then merely taking potshots in<br/>&gt; the manual mapping of the tuning of each rank in the synthesizer or<br/>&gt; the controller instrument.  Perhaps, then it would seem so much less<br/>&gt; arbitrary in nature.</p><p>At the risk of being labelled a &quot;7+5 chauvinist,&quot; I might suggest that<br/>the topic of such keyboard designs also may have it&apos;s &quot;x/y&quot;<br/>parameters. In the y-dimension, we have &quot;generalizability,&quot; the idea<br/>that each keyboard has the same intervals in the same arrangement.</p><p>In the x-dimension, we have &quot;familiarity&quot; -- or, more specifically,<br/>familiarity for people used to a 12-note keyboard, and more<br/>particularly yet one in the 7+5 arrangement which apparently came into<br/>vogue sometime around the early to middle 14th century.</p><p>A &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; 24-note archicembalo with two identical Pythagorean<br/>keyboards a Pythagorean comma apart, and likewise a 24-note meantone<br/>archicembalo with two identical keyboards in 1/4-comma meantone a<br/>diesis apart (128:125, or more generically a &quot;fifthtone&quot;), maximize<br/>both advantages. Each keyboard in itself is ideally familiar --<br/>especially to those of us used to Pythagorean or meantone tunings in<br/>something like Eb-G# -- and the relationship between the two keyboards<br/>is consistent and easy to grasp (at least for me).</p><p>Thus if we want both generalizability (symmetry between keyboards) and<br/>familiarity (a familiar layout for each keyboard), then a &quot;12 x 2&quot;<br/>array or 24 notes in all would seem an attractive choice.</p><p>From some people, of course, circularity is an important consideration<br/>calling for larger arrays of notes: 53 for Pythagorean, or 31 for<br/>1/4-comma meantone (real mathematical purists might insist on 31-tet<br/>or 53-tet, evening out some variations in more remote intervals which<br/>make a simple Pythagorean 53 or 1/4-comma meantone 31 actually a kind<br/>of subtly unequal &quot;well-temperament&quot;).</p><p>For the meantone situation, both historical precedent and certain<br/>recent reports on this Tuning List about patent proposals lead me to<br/>suspect that two 19-note keyboards might be a logical choice.</p><p>Of course, there would be two obvious applications for two such<br/>keyboards tuned in unison: either a 19-tet system of the kind proposed<br/>by Guillaume Costeley in 1570 (and endorsed in the 20th century by<br/>such theorists as Joseph Yasser), or a 19-note set of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone (or 31-tet if you prefer).</p><p>However, we could additionally use these keyboards to implement a<br/>31-note meantone tuning. For a circulating 31-note meantone with<br/>completely generalized keyboards (and a bit of redundancy), we can use<br/>the 19 notes of the first manual plus 12 of the second, with the<br/>others replicating some notes on the first manual, but maintaining the<br/>consistent layout:</p><p>       Db*       Eb*               Gb*       Ab*      Bb*<br/>    Db        Eb         F     Gb         Ab       Bb          C<br/>C*         D*        E*     F*        G*        A*       B*      C*<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       Db        Eb      E#        Gb        Ab        Bb      B#<br/>    C#        D#               F#         G#        A#<br/>C          D         E      F          G         A         B      C</p><p>Note that in this tuning, both keyboards have an identical pattern:<br/>major and minor semitones (about 3/5-tone and 2/5-tone respectively in<br/>meantone 31) appear in the same places on either keyboard, and<br/>corresponding notes on the two keyboards are always a diesis or<br/>fifthtone apart.</p><p>Here I envision split keys on each keyboard for dividing the<br/>whole-tones, e.g. C#/Db, with the front portion of the key giving C#<br/>and the back Db (or whatever the user chooses to program, of course),<br/>and a single small key between E and F or B and C.</p><p>&gt; With the flexibility of MIDI and modern synthesizers, and of course<br/>&gt; the assignment of X/Y &apos;matrices&apos; on the instrument itself, it seems<br/>&gt; to me that any sort of scheme can be left up the &quot;performer&quot;. I<br/>&gt; rather like this idea, despite its lack of any sort available<br/>&gt; standard that I can recall.</p><p>This is a very important point, and one of the advantages of a<br/>synthesizer: the hardware can permit many types of &quot;software&quot;<br/>settings, with the performer free to choose between them.</p><p>&gt; I will definitely agree that it is certainly not the first time this<br/>&gt; concept has been seen in practice. But, I do think with the level of<br/>&gt; technology we have today with electronic instruments, perhaps it<br/>&gt; might be wise to try this concept yet again, as I think it might be<br/>&gt; more promising this time around.</p><p>Certainly it should be more easily accessible. Now, as then,<br/>overcoming psychological as well as technical barriers may be<br/>important. We are told that many keyboardists of the late 16th century<br/>were &quot;frightened&quot; by the multitude of keys on Vicentino&apos;s instrument,<br/>and also can read the views of a theorist such as Vincenzo Galilei who<br/>argued that intervals such as dieses or fifthtones were<br/>&quot;ill-proportioned&quot; to the nature of the human ear!</p><p>One minor but not insignificant point might be the ergonomics of a<br/>keyboard array. Using two 12-note controllers, I find that my main<br/>problem can be in moving quickly from one manual to the other,<br/>especially when using an organ-like sound and striving for legato. The<br/>keyboards have to be at least around 3&quot; apart vertically, a bit more<br/>than the depth of each keyboard, and this is a bit of a &quot;jump&quot; for my<br/>hands. I use a shelf permitting the upper manual to slide forward so<br/>that it overlaps the lower one, a partial solution, but hardly an<br/>ideal or comprehensive one.</p><p>Maybe a design deliberately combining two 12-note or 19-note keyboards<br/>into a single package could emphasize making it easy to shift between<br/>the keyboards, and also to play notes on different keyboards with the<br/>fingers of one hand (something which a 16th-century observer remarks<br/>is often called for on Vicentino&apos;s instrument).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
