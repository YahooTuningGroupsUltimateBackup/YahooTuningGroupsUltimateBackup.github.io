This seems to be a method of improving 12-ET tuning.<br/>It is not needed with good guitars, unless one wants to<br/>make the guitar play very loudly; in that case the &quot;action&quot; would<br/>be too high, the tension of stopping the string would raise the<br/>pitch, but to a different degree for different strings, and then,<br/>yes, one would need bent frets. Put in this way, perhaps there is<br/>a case for a patent even if bent frets have been used before.</p><p>- George Kahrimanis   <a href="mailto:anakreon@hol.gr">anakreon@hol.gr</a></p></div>
