Another contributor suggested 2/7-comma meantone (Zarlino&apos;s<br/>proposal) as a pleasing tuning for the diatonic scale in this<br/>historical setting, and in fact Mark Lindley remarks that it can be<br/>very pleasing for music with lots of what Zarlino would call<br/>&quot;arithmetic divisions&quot; of the fifth -- that is, sonorities with the<br/>minor third below and major third above (string-ratio 6:5:4,<br/>frequency-ratio 10:12:15).</p><p>Also, much in agreement with Paul Erlich, I&apos;d like the emphasize that<br/>indeed it is possible to use various temperaments (including n-tet&apos;s<br/>and meantone) with an awareness of the JI intervals being<br/>approximated, and also of the compromises being made.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
