The explanation Paul Erlich provided at<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12803">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12803</a></p><p>is an excellent answer to your question.  I just wanted to<br/>supplement it with the comment that you should be very aware<br/>of the two different definitions for &apos;limit&apos;: *prime*- and<br/>*odd*-limit.</p><p>When I say &apos;limit&apos;, I almost invariably mean &apos;prime&apos;, and when<br/>Paul says it, he almost always means &apos;odd&apos;.  It just reflects<br/>on what each of us places more importance.</p><p>IMO, odd-limit is an important consideration when the object<br/>of study is dyads (i.e., &apos;bare&apos; intervals), but for any larger<br/>collection of pitches - whether chords, chord progressions, entire<br/>pieces, or entire tuning systems - I&apos;d place much more importance<br/>on the prime-limits that can be observed in action.</p><p>My Dictionary definitions of &apos;prime&apos;, &apos;affect&apos;, and the related<br/>links will explain my position in more detail.

But for<br/>chords, the issue is a little more intricate. Looking at many JI<br/>chords, one sometimes gets the impression that prime limit is more<br/>important than odd limit. But that is because many chords are<br/>composed of several consonant intervals of a low odd limit, and<br/>perhaps just one interval that has a high odd limit but low prime<br/>limit. For example, the major seventh chord has 5 intervals within<br/>the 5-odd limit and 1 ratio of 15. The chord is pretty consonant<br/>overall, and the tendency is to think that the prime limit (5) is<br/>therefore more relevant than the odd limit (15). But many 5-prime-<br/>limit chords are very dissonant. A better way of looking at the issue<br/>is that the 5 consonant intervals and 1 dissonant interval in the<br/>chord make the chord 5/6 consonant and 1/6 dissonant -- the single<br/>ratio of 15 is simply a splash of dissonance in a rather consonant<br/>cocktail.</p></div>
