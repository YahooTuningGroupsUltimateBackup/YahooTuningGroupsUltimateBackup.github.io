Now 17 is an odd number, and cannot be divided into two<br/>&gt;&quot;mean-tones&quot; of equal integer size which together produce this<br/>&gt;third.</p><p>[...]</p><p>&gt;If we want a 53-tet-like tuning that _does_ support meantone in the<br/>&gt;usual sense, then maybe 106-tet would be an ideal solution. Here our<br/>&gt;near-5:4 major third would be 34 steps, so that a mean-tone of 17<br/>&gt;steps (the mean of 9/53 octave and 8/53 octave) would indeed answer to<br/>&gt;your requirements. This mean-tone is ~192.45 cents, very slightly<br/>&gt;smaller than the whole-tone in 1/4-comma meantone (~193.16 cents)<br/>&gt;because our 53-tet or 106-tet &quot;schisma third,&quot; like its Pythagorean<br/>&gt;counterpart, is slightly narrower than 5:4.</p><p>Margo, you can use a similar argument to the first paragraph above to show<br/>that 106-tET is _not_ a meantone tuning. If the major second is 17 steps,<br/>the major ninth is 106+17 = 123 steps. The major ninth can be divided into<br/>two perfect fifths. But since 123 is an odd number, the meantone tuning you<br/>intend does not have a perfect fifth.</p><p>With another doubling, however, the problem is solved -- 212-tET contains<br/>both 53-tET and meantone tunings. This could have been apparent from the<br/>start by noting that one needs to flatten the fifth by 1/4-comma in a<br/>meantone, and that in 53-tET, which has virtually pure fifths, one degree is<br/>approximately equal to a comma, so by dividing each degree into four parts<br/>(obtaining 53*4=212-tET), one effects a meantone tuning.</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We have moved!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div><h3><a id=11070 href="#11070">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Using its 44-degree (694.7&cent;)<br/>fifths, it supports 5-limit diatonicism as in 19-tET (since 76=19*4), and<br/>the 7-limit 14-tone scales I found in 26-tET and that Dave Keenan found were<br/>better in 38-tET (since 76=38*2). Using its 45-degree (710.5&cent;) fifths, it<br/>supports the 10-tone scales that are the main subject of the paper (since 76<br/>contains the half-octave interval) and would also support a rather extreme<br/>xeno-gothic tonality. Either of these fifth sizes could be used for 3-limit<br/>pentatonicism, though with strongly different melodic characters; and the<br/>44-degree fifth could be used for octatonicism with its eight 5-limit<br/>consonant triads, by interlacing two 4-tET scales 44 degrees apart . . .</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We have moved!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
