My ultimate wish is<br/>to transport an audience to the realm of pure feeling--to a state where all<br/>conflicting ideologies reach an harmonic<br/>concordance.&quot;<br/>Jon Pareles wrote in THE NEW YORK TIMES,<br/>&quot;Strange things can happen in the spaces between the steps of the Western<br/>chromatic scale.....David First used finely calibrated<br/>pitch combinations to make the whole gallery throb and buzz and shimmer<br/>with invisible turbulence.&quot;<br/>The room is set spinning, careening and flying into a whirling<br/>dervish of tone and vibrational resonance. Sound swoops into the very fiber<br/>of the listener&apos;s being, and soars up the spine,<br/>directly into the cerebral cortex.</p><p>Keenan Lawler, composer/improviser, will open the show performing music<br/>based on his new release on Konstant: &quot;The Ghost of a Plane of Air.&quot; It<br/>features his acclaimed work on prepared, bowed and<br/>electronically-manipulated National Steel Resonator Guitar.<br/>Always seeking to expand beyond the boundaries of convention into a place<br/>of freedom where anything might happen, as a means of process Lawler takes<br/>this unlikely instrument so rich with tradition into an arena whereby it<br/>becomes a transmutable sound source -almost, in effect, a new instrument<br/>unto itself.</p><p>The webcast will be displayed at <a href="http://www.konstant.com">www.konstant.com</a><br/>Webcast provided by Shadowcast Networks, <a href="http://www.shadowcast.com">www.shadowcast.com</a>.</p></div>
