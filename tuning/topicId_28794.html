Where can we hear this?</p><p>[Eric wrote:]<br/>&gt;Although my cousin urges me to buy a synthesizer, I don&apos;t have one<br/>&gt;yet.</p><p>Hi, Cuz!  Did you tell me off-list that your home sound card is broken?<br/>Hmmm, how does John Starrett&apos;s applet work then, I wonder?  But in any<br/>case, if you _do_ have access to a working sound card or module, you can<br/>produce MIDI music without a keyboard if you&apos;re willing to enter it by<br/>hand into a text file, then translate the file into .mid using the<br/>program I posted a couple of weeks back.  Go to</p><p>   <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/</a></p><p>, change to the JdL directory, and download <a href="http://mhe.zip">mhe.zip</a>.  Instructions are<br/>contained in the file mheMan.txt, included with the .exe and a bunch of<br/>.bat files.</p><p>One thing I forgot to include in that zip is a program that turns bends<br/>(in cents) relative to 12-tET into actual MIDI bend messages, assuming<br/>the default (and usual) bend range of +/- 2 semitones.  If anyone would<br/>like that, I&apos;ll post it.  I am also, of course, available for any help I<br/>might be able to provide.</p><p>Yes, please do get a MIDI keyboard, 61 or more notes, when possible<br/>(with or without a self-contained sound module; older units like my Korg<br/>M1 are not General MIDI compatible, so I use it more as a keyboard than<br/>a synth now).  Though you have little prior musical experience you will<br/>have a whole new world available because of it.  Heck, you may end up a<br/>next great composer (perhaps after your new daughter is a little older<br/>;-&gt; ).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
