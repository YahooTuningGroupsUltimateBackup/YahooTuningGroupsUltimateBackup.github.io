I have<br/>been playing 34 tone eq for 4 years, and think it is a fabulous eq<br/>temp...needless to say, it contains two 17 tone scales, so I would say<br/>play 34 tone; then you not only get 17 tone eq, but also the killer<br/>major 3rd of 34, and the comma as well. As far as the problem of fingers<br/>on teensy frets, I have heard others say the same thing; but, I have<br/>fairly large hands myself, and have had little trouble managing to get<br/>around on a 34 tone fretboard. It&apos;s a matter of serious practice, and<br/>learning to play right on the tips of the fingers...I figure if I can do<br/>it, anybody can. Plus, there&apos;s 53 tone guitarists in Uruguay, and Jon<br/>Catler plays a 49 tone just fingerboard. Come on, go ahead and get a 34<br/>toner, you&apos;ll love it (and please post me privately if you have any<br/>questions)...Hstick</p></div>
