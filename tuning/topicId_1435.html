Does Onelist have means of filtering out full-frontal<br/>mathematics so that children need not be exposed to it?</p><p>I suppose the people who like 13/8 are sure they&apos;re not really listening to<br/>18/11.  The difference between these is quite a good 13-limit comma.  (1 2 0<br/>0 -1)H-(-3 0 0 0 0 1)H=(4 2 0 0 -1 -1)H or 144/143.  A lack of 13-limit<br/>commas was mentioned before.  I reckon this is the best one.  13-limit<br/>intervals are always going to be confused with 11-limit ones, so you may as<br/>well make it official.</p><p>The &quot;interesting&quot; 13-limit intervals are 13/10 and 20/13 because they&apos;re the<br/>only &quot;large&quot; ones distinct from 11-limit consonances in 31-equal.  They&apos;re<br/>also the wolves.  I don&apos;t have any good chords that include them, though.</p><p>&gt;I agree that 13/8 sounds more consonant than 11/8. But I have to remind<br/>myself<br/>&gt;that those brought up around 12 et would have a harder time in<br/>incorporating<br/>&gt;this interval as it  lies outside it matrix. with 7,9,13,15,17,and 19, 23<br/>(in<br/>&gt;dominants) we can use them in 12 tone scale much easier</p><p>Is this statement going to be clarified at any point?  Has it been already?</p><p>While I&apos;m at it, I have got some ideas on graphing 11-limit intervals.  The<br/>first is to recognise 11/9 as a neutral third, and so put it in the middle<br/>of the fifth:</p><p>     A----C/---E----G/---B----D/---F#---A/---C#<br/>    / \       / \       / \       / \       /<br/>   /   \  Gb /   \  Db /   \  Ab /   \  Eb /<br/>  /  D# \   /  A# \   /  E# \   /  B# \   /<br/> /       \ /       \ /       \ /       \ /<br/>F----A\---C----E\---G----B\---D----F/---A<br/> \       / \       / \       / \       / \<br/>  \  D/ /   \  A/ /   \  E/ /   \  B/ /   \<br/>   \   /  F# \   /  C# \   /  G# \   /  D# \<br/>    \ /       \ /       \ /       \ /       \<br/>     Ab---C\---Eb---G\---Bb---D\---F----A\---C</p><p>This makes sense to me melodically, but harmony&apos;s a bit odd.  A complete<br/>11-limit chord looks like this:</p><p>     5<br/>    / \<br/>   /   \<br/>  /  7  \<br/> /       \<br/>4---------6---------9----11</p><p>This is the easiest way of integrating the 13-limit as well.  Call 13/8 the<br/>neutral sixth.  Assuming I got the diagram above right (which I wouldn&apos;t lay<br/>money on) the complete chord should come out like this:</p><p>          5<br/>         / \<br/>        /   \<br/>       /  7  \<br/>      /       \<br/>13---4---------6---------9----11</p><p>The other 11-limit lattice gives a complete chord like this:</p><p>      5<br/>     / \<br/>    /   \<br/>   /     11<br/>  /   7   \<br/> /         \<br/>4-----------6-----------9</p><p>This works with the 11-limit comma 121/120 or (-3 -1 -1 0 2)H.  If you<br/>really want your 11-limit pure, obviously neither of these lattices will do.</p><p>Note that I use octave specific matrices above.  So, for your determinantsm<br/>make (4 2 0 0 -1 -1)H into (2 0 0 -1 -1)h and (-3 -1 -1 0 2)H into (-1 -1 0<br/>2)h.  The other 11-limit comma is where twice 11/9 is the same as 3/2, or<br/>(-1 5 0 0 -2)H=0 or (5 0 0 -2)h=0.  Note also that (-3 -1 -1 0 2)H + (-1 5 0<br/>0 -2)H = (-4 4 -1 0 0)H which is the good old syntonic comma.  So, in<br/>meantone, one of these 11-limit commas implies the other.  Hence they both<br/>work in 31-equal.  Or, putting it the other way round, if you want both the<br/>11-limit commas to work you need to be in a meantone.</p></div><h3><a id=1524 href="#1524">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
