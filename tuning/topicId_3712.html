So continuing:</p><p>15-limit:<br/>ratios                                    cents<br/>8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15                     0 204 386 551 702 841 969 1088<br/>1/15:1/14:1/13:1/12:1/11:1/10:1/9:1/8     0 119 247 386 537 702 884 1088<br/>12:14:15:21 (=1/35:1/30:1/28:1/20)        0 267 386 969<br/>20:28:30:35 (=1/21:1/15:1/14:1/12)        0 583 702 969</p><p>I leave the five saturated 17-limit chords and the five saturated 19-limit<br/>chords as an exercise to the reader (an easy one thanks to Graham who<br/>already did the hard part).</p><p>However, I think that well before one reaches this point, there are much<br/>more consonant &quot;saturated&quot; chords that cannot be expressed in just<br/>intonation. Many of these have been discussed recently in the context of<br/>12-tone or meantone temperament (e.g., the major chord with added 6th and<br/>9th, the augmented triad, the diminished seventh chord); I&apos;ll review one<br/>less familiar example (I once called it the &quot;magic chord&quot;) here:</p><p>In 72-tone equal temperament, take the chord C E- F#- Bb-- (where - means<br/>flattening by 1/72 octave relative to 12-tone equal temperament). The six<br/>intervals in this chord are:</p><p>Interval   Cents   Approximate JI Interval<br/>C   E-     383     5:4 (386)<br/>C   F#-    583     7:5 (583)<br/>C   Bb--   967     7:4 (969)<br/>E-  F#-    200     9:8 (204)<br/>E-  Bb--   583     7:5 (583)<br/>F#- Bb--   383     5:4 (386)</p><p>One cannot tune the chord in JI and have all the intervals listed in the<br/>rightmost column. The best one can do is to use 28:25 instead of 9:8; then<br/>the other five intervals can be just as shown. 28:25 is a 25-limit interval<br/>but is clearly a case where the limit is of far less importance than the<br/>proximity to simpler ratios. It is 196 cents, and has a fairly clear<br/>interpretation as an 8-cent flat 9:8, but it might also be heard as a<br/>14-cent sharp 10:9. Tuning it closer to 9:8 would increase its consonance<br/>and the 72-tET version shown here does so with minimal damage to the other<br/>intervals.</p><p>So the &quot;magic chord&quot; is, allowing for intervals to be tempered by up to 4<br/>cents, a saturated 9-limit chord. Similarly, the augmented triad in 12-tET<br/>is, allowing intervals to be tempered by up to 14 cents, a saturated 5-limit<br/>chord. Neither of these chords can be expressed adequately in just<br/>intonation. So putting aside the difficult issue of fleshing out the<br/>historical implications of Margo&apos;s conjecture, we see that even the<br/>theoretical implications present some significant problems.</p></div>
