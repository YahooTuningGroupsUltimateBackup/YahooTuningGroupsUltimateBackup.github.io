Things line up<br/>differently than meantone and in a particularly interesting way.</p><p>Let&apos;s assume we&apos;re in 27-tet for this, because I think that that&apos;s<br/>pretty good for superpyth, yes? Go to scala and type mode/equal 5 5 1<br/>5 5 5 1 to load up superpyth ionian.</p><p>I think it&apos;s proven that every triad class in a MOS comes in three<br/>specific triad sizes assuming the period is the octave. If not, that&apos;s<br/>how it seems to be for most MOS&apos;s. For meantone, if you look at the<br/>1-3-5 triad class, this scale has the nice property that these three<br/>types of triads are very different in concordance from one another.<br/>Three very obviously perceptually distinct categories of tonalness<br/>emerge from this. This is also part of why I think the scale is so<br/>easy to cognize.</p><p>These three categories are generally referred to as &quot;major,&quot; &quot;minor,&quot;<br/>and &quot;diminished.&quot; The first is very tonal, the middle is semitonal,<br/>and the latter is almost completely non-tonal. The diminished chord is<br/>ONLY non-tonal insofar as it doesn&apos;t sound like 5:6:7, which it<br/>doesn&apos;t if you double the root in the bass... Bummer.</p><p>(In fact, it&apos;s such a bummer that diminished chords actually compel<br/>you to wish, on some level, that this harsh, unpleasant sound would go<br/>away. This is part of why it&apos;s so nice when it resolves to a<br/>concordant sound. This is probably because the brain doesn&apos;t like the<br/>spectrum being flooded with lots of random, uncorrelated periodicity<br/>information while it&apos;s trying to figure out what&apos;s going on. There are<br/>chords that are even more discordant that will probably have people in<br/>the room asking you to wear headphones, which means their brain is<br/>like &quot;beep boop beep organism take action to remove stimulus.&quot; I also<br/>think that the same process happens in attenuated form with minor<br/>chords, and this is... anyway)</p><p>So let&apos;s see how things are laid out for meantone - a review. Here&apos;s<br/>something called a concordance table, which is a generalized version<br/>of those diatonic triad quality charts:</p><p>Meantone Diatonic 1-3-5 Triad Class Concordance Table</p><p>Degree - Notes - Class - Oddly appropriate emoticon<br/>  I    - C E G - major - :)<br/>  ii   - D F A - minor - :|<br/>  iii  - E G B - minor - :|<br/>  IV   - F A C - major - :)<br/>  V    - G B D - major - :)<br/>  vi   - A C E - minor - :|<br/>  vii&ordm; - B D F - dim.  - &gt;:O</p><p>I didn&apos;t put 4:5:6 and 10:12:15 in there because I don&apos;t think that<br/>10:12:15 or 1/(4:5:6) has anything to do with why minor chords sound<br/>minor. Instead, &quot;minor&quot; refers to a perceptual category in which a<br/>chord is lower in tonalness than an otonality, but not so low that you<br/>want to get rid of it. Someday I&apos;ll replace the &quot;oddly appropriate<br/>emoticon&quot; with a measure of harmonic entropy for each of these chords.</p><p>OK, the point: in superpyth, everything works out differently. There<br/>are still three interval classes, and we can still call them major,<br/>minor, and diminished, although that might mess people up. The &quot;major&quot;<br/>chord is something like D-A-C, which is 4:6:7, and the &quot;minor&quot; chord<br/>is something like C-G-B, which is 14:21:27. B-F-A is the &quot;diminished&quot;<br/>chord, and who knows what it is. We&apos;ll use that terminology.</p><p>(Note: what&apos;s more consonant - C-G-B in 22-tet, or C-Eb-G in meantone?)</p><p>Superpyth Diatonic 1-5-7 Triad Class Concordance Table</p><p>Degree - Notes - Class - Oddly appropriate emoticon<br/>  i    - C G B - minor - :]<br/>  II   - D A C - major - 8-)!<br/>  III  - E B D - major - 8-)!<br/>  iv   - F C E - minor - :]<br/>  V    - G D F - major - 8-)!<br/>  VI   - A E G - major - :8-)!<br/>  vii&ordm; - B F A - dim.  - &gt;:O</p><p>Wow, that&apos;s a lot different! So you have four major chords in this<br/>layout, two minor chords, and one diminished chord. However, you might<br/>notice that the III chord still kind of sounds darker than the other<br/>ones. Let&apos;s try the 1-5-7-9 tetrad class table, the &quot;major&quot; chord of<br/>which is 4:6:7:9, and see how that looks. We&apos;ll call the classes<br/>&quot;major,&quot; &quot;minor,&quot; &quot;more minor,&quot; and &quot;diminished.&quot;</p><p>Superpyth Diatonic 1-5-7-9 Tetrad Class Concordance Table</p><p>Degree -  Notes  - Class  - Oddly appropriate emoticon<br/>  i    - C G B D - minor  - :}<br/>  II   - D A C E - major  - :)!<br/>  III  - E B D F - more m.- :|<br/>  iv   - F C E G - minor  - :}<br/>  V    - G D F A - major  - :)!<br/>  VI   - A E G B - major  - :)!<br/>  vii&ordm; - B F A C - dim.   - &gt;:O</p><p>I rated the E B D F as more minor sounding than C G B D, because<br/>that&apos;s how it sounds to me. Feel free to lay things out your own way<br/>if you see differently. But I think that this is why you&apos;re going to<br/>hear E-B-D-E as having more &quot;background dissonance&quot; in that scale than<br/>G-D-F-G, because you&apos;ll probably play the F at some point. If you<br/>really avoid it you can probably force the perception of E-B-D-E to<br/>major, just like if you&apos;re in meantone C ionian you can force the<br/>perception of B-b-d to minor instead of diminished if you just never<br/>play that F.</p><p>In closing, I think that just like folks a thousand years ago couldn&apos;t<br/>hear the major third as anything but dissonant - I think that there<br/>are other tonal structures multiplexed into the diatonic scale that we<br/>could be using that we haven&apos;t explored. Perhaps if we start playing<br/>around with 4:6:7 chords in superpyth, we can take advantage of new<br/>sounds hidden in the diatonic scale that we aren&apos;t properly imagining<br/>right now. At least, that&apos;s just my hope.</p><p>And I think it&apos;d be worthwhile to find more scales that have<br/>perceptually similar categories too.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2011 12:38:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Mar 6, 2011 at 2:10 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In closing, I think that just like folks a thousand years ago couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; hear the major third as anything but dissonant - I think that there<br/>&gt; are other tonal structures multiplexed into the diatonic scale that we<br/>&gt; could be using that we haven&apos;t explored.

At least, that&apos;s just my hope.</p><p>Also, a quick note to add to this - the four major chords are separate<br/>from one another by fifth. So you have, if we&apos;re in C ionian</p><p>G 4:6:7<br/>D 4:6:7<br/>A 4:6:7<br/>E 4:6:7</p><p>(we really need a generalization of major. Should we just say that a<br/>piece is in the key of C 4:6:7 major?)</p><p>Of these, D and A have major IV and V chords. E works if you don&apos;t<br/>mind the V chord being half-diminshed, which is kind of a jazzier<br/>sound, since us jazz guys like lots of extensions on our V chords. And<br/>if you&apos;re in 22-tet the tritone is actually 11/8, which is nice.</p><p>If you&apos;re into the tritone hypothesis, A is the tonal &quot;major&quot; system<br/>here and C is the tonal &quot;minor&quot; one. So superpyth aeolian is the<br/>winner. If you&apos;re like me and think tonality isn&apos;t about scale<br/>structure, then most of these will do as tonal structures of different<br/>feeling and strength.</p><p>It&apos;s also noteworthy that the subminor third functions in some sense<br/>as an &quot;avoid&quot; note over these 4:6:7 chords in that it forces the<br/>perception of the chord as minor. If you don&apos;t mind that, play it. If<br/>you don&apos;t like that, be careful of it. Perhaps one thing to do is to<br/>throw some extra 5/4&apos;s in where needed to counter that perception, but<br/>to use the superpyth scale as a bare skeleton to start out with. And<br/>then you&apos;re doing something similar to all of this modal jazz modern<br/>harmony I keep talking about.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2011 1:31:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Mar 6, 2011 at 2:10 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In closing, I think that just like folks a thousand years ago couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; hear the major third as anything but dissonant - I think that there<br/>&gt; are other tonal structures multiplexed into the diatonic scale that we<br/>&gt; could be using that we haven&apos;t explored.</p><p>Addendum: Ravel got there first. Check out</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vq6hAQJaRA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vq6hAQJaRA</a></p><p>This video has two pieces stuck back to back; the first one is the one<br/>of interest. It&apos;s about 3 minutes long, so give it a listen. The part<br/>I&apos;m referring to specifically is 1:51, where he resolves from Ebm7 -&gt;<br/>Bb9omit3. You&apos;ll recognize the part I&apos;m talking about because the<br/>whole thing brings you into some kind of mystical 7-limit trancelike<br/>state.</p><p>At this point, the melody sticks to Eb pentatonic minor, which<br/>combined with the below chord puts you in Bb aeolian. The strings<br/>modulate beautifully around within it, so it doesn&apos;t strictly stick to<br/>Bb aeolian, but that&apos;s the gist. Ravel harmonizes it, however, by<br/>playing a dominant-tempered version of 4:7:9:12, which snaps you back<br/>into &quot;otonal&quot; mode. The effect is completely sublime and chilling and<br/>completely transforms the feel of aeolian mode into something entirely<br/>different. It wouldn&apos;t sound &quot;right&quot; if you threw a major third in at<br/>the bottom, turning the chord into 4:5:7:9:12, but it also wouldn&apos;t<br/>sound right if you threw the minor third in either. Anything would<br/>completely destroy the feeling of that chord.</p><p>So there you go. Lots of hidden higher-limit possibilities hidden in<br/>the diatonic scale after all.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2011 2:17:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Apr 23, 2011 at 4:31 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Addendum: Ravel got there first.
