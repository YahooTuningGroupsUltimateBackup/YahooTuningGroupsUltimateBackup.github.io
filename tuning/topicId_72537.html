It&apos;s<br/>definitely not 12-edo.  My understanding is you have to start with<br/>all the harmonizations before stepping out to more outside notes.<br/>This makes Schoenbergian sense---since his music as many would admit<br/>is tonal harmony.  That&apos;s why his is the most listened to today of<br/>any avant garde (arguable).  He&apos;s on the Brahms cultivation--- when<br/>he expanded to 12 notes it is still great music because of the music<br/>theory of tonality underneath it, yet there are less discriminations<br/>than even Liszt.</p><p>In my 31-edo latest findings, what seems to be working best is<br/>finding the basic chords and scales.  I&apos;m finding it difficult to use<br/>every single chromatic note as the root note they are not all the<br/>same.  Let me explain I took the major scale in C and harmonized it<br/>all the way up in 7ths and then for Dbb1 all the way up an octave to<br/>B#30.  It definitely has some sweet spots in there.  But in my<br/>opinion I&apos;m probably going to just stick with the basic harmony and<br/>then find if there is some neat dissonance works.  I like dissonance<br/>though some of my favorites are Ruggles&apos; Sun Treader, Helps Shall We<br/>Dance, Symphony 1, Schoenberg Chamber Sym 1, Pierrot Lunaire.</p><p>With decades of exploration in the widely used 12-edo, only then I<br/>think could dissonances be appropriated decently.  A lot of listening<br/>is subjective but educated listening is best---don&apos;t disregard the<br/>old school.  I really like this microtonal Bach Brandenburg from<br/>Early Festival.</p><p>Great messages and I am glad to contribute.</p><p>your addict,<br/>John</p></div>
