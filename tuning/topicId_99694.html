What is it?</p><p>You can discern that from the first division you did, from 31 to 20 and 11.  Your generator is either the 20 or the 11 (octave inversions of each other, so both produce the same scale).  The name for this temperament is either Sentinel (named for the piece Jacob Barton wrote in it, the first documented instance of its use) or Squares (I think).</p><p>Generally, any time you use this process of successive divisions, your very first division gives you your generator.</p><p>HTH.</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
