Part of the reason why I included the bit about the Sumerians<br/>is because I want to be clear that so-called &quot;Pythagorean&quot; tuning is<br/>far older than any person named Pythagoras, if he indeed ever lived at all.<br/>So do I need to make all of this more explicit in the definition?<br/>I guess so ...</p><p>&gt; And second, is the tie between Sumerian tuning and the Akkadian texts.<br/>&gt; Please correct me if I am mistaken, but why is it assumed that the long<br/>past<br/>&gt; civilization of the Sumerians used the tuning of the later Babylonians?<br/>The<br/>&gt; work of Ben Hume in building exact replicas indicates just minor scales on<br/>&gt; the Sumerian aulos.</p><p>Johnny, please read my Sumerian page carefully.  I explicitly state<br/>that *I am assuming* that the Babylonians were retaining previous<br/>Sumerian knowledge in their math problems because they retained the<br/>use of the Sumerian logograms.  On my webpage, I present first the<br/>translations by Eleanor Robson of the Babylonian tablet, then I<br/>strip out all the Akkadian (= Babylonian) words and produce another<br/>version which uses *only* the Sumerian logograms.  The gist of the<br/>problem and the algorithm for solving it is still intact.  Therefore<br/>one must come to the conclusion that the Sumerians knew the algorithm.</p><p>Also, I state on my webpage that some Babylonian math and tuning<br/>texts -- not to mention many of the mythology texts, if one accepts<br/>that the Sumero-Babylonian religion was equivalent to its music-theory,<br/>as purported by McClain and Terpstra -- seem to indicate that 5-limit<br/>tuning may have been used by both cultures.  It&apos;s just that my<br/>emphasis here -- naturally enough, in a definition of &quot;Pythagorean&quot;<br/>-- is that 3-limit tuning is far older than ancient Greece, and<br/>I would argue *strongly* that it and its mathematics were known<br/>to the Sumerians, as well as their conquerors.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32625 href="#32625">ðŸ”—</a>unidala &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2002 8:38:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; From: &lt;Afmmjr@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: &lt;tuning@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, January 12, 2002 7:45 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] updated definition: &quot;Pythagorean&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Like many on this list, I admire Joe Monzo for his<br/>&gt; &gt; And second, is the tie between Sumerian tuning and the Akkadian<br/>&gt; &gt; texts.<br/>&gt; &gt; Please correct me if I am mistaken, but why is it assumed that<br/>&gt; &gt; the long<br/>&gt; &gt; past<br/>&gt; &gt; civilization of the Sumerians used the tuning of the later<br/>&gt; &gt; Babylonians?<br/>&gt; &gt; The<br/>&gt; &gt; work of Ben Hume in building exact replicas indicates<br/>&gt; &gt; just minor scales on the Sumerian aulos.</p><p>J Gill: Hello, Johnny and Joe!
