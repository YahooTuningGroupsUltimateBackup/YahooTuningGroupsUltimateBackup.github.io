We got harmonic clouds, we got Justness out the wazoo, we<br/>got lotta stuff being thrown around about the value of adherance to absolute<br/>ratios and we got lines drawn between the warm fuzzies and the scientists<br/>that hold onto the Holy Grail of Just perfection......<br/>    How important is the absolute ratio?  Depends on the perception of the<br/>listeners and the needs of the composer.  The former are easily satisfied,<br/>the latter maybe never.  Sorta like &quot;one is too many, and a thousand are not<br/>enough&quot;.<br/>  When we talk about tolerances of .01 cent, we are discussing theoretical<br/>values that have nothing to do with the sensory experience. I don&apos;t care what<br/>the instrument is.  However, when we talk about .1 cent, then we are into the<br/>realm of the Weinriech effect of piano strings and the differences are<br/>certainly there; (mistuning unisons on a concert grand by this amount per<br/>string, which may result in perhaps a cumulative .2 or .3 cents phase factor<br/>will definately have an effect on sustain).<br/>    The same paradigns can be found in organ tuning, where pipes will &quot;draw&quot;<br/>the near pitch toward themselves.  Get too close to a ratio and the<br/>instrument will take over.</p><p>    This response, prompted by Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re asking:</p><p>&gt;When tuning instrument with such and such precision in such and such tuning<br/>system (whatever it is</p><p>JI or ET). How do you cope with octave stretching in low and high</p><p>pitch range.&lt;&lt;</p><p>    Well, the right amount of stretch depends on the inharmonicity of the<br/>medium and the expectations of the listener.</p><p>&gt;I know that the piano tuner who comes home use electronic tuner to set</p><p>&gt;pitch in the mid-range and use ear alone for the rest of the keyboard.&lt;</p><p>     Hmm, sounds like someone that needs a machine for setting the<br/>temperament.</p><p>&gt; he said that HE was called specifically by some professionnal jazz pianists<br/>because he his famous in his</p><p>tuners team to be the one that &quot;stretch the most&quot; in the high pitch. It is a<br/>matter of psychoacoustic AND of taste.&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Yes, the &quot;New York Stretch&quot; used by Steinway factory tuners creates a pure<br/>triple octave and pure fifths above the C5, however, it also makes things<br/>rather tense.  The major effect of this amount of stretch is that the thirds<br/>become faster, thus, more stimulative.  But, like cocaine, it often seems<br/>that more and more is needed to create the same buzz.   Some Jazz players I<br/>work for like this, too, (the stretch, not the toot). They keep at it until<br/>everything sounds like it wants to scream.   Mozart begins to sound pretty<br/>strained by it.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Was this problem known in &quot;historical tuning&quot; ?&lt;&lt;</p><p>  The historical tuning, as exemplified by the well-temperaments, doesn&apos;t<br/>need this so much. The various remote keys, with their busier thirds, are<br/>often used to create the same effect.  The biggest consideration is the<br/>contrast between the keys with the smoother thirds and those that have a lot<br/>of &quot;expression&quot;, ie, tempering.   When you have the intonational palette so<br/>well equipped, the sensual engagement can be created by compositon,which give<br/>more control to the composer rather than the instrument&apos;s sound.<br/>     It seems to be a shortcoming of ET that the blandness inherent in<br/>sameness can only be ameliorated by excessive stretching.  I consider that<br/>avenue necessary only to those that are inured to tonal nuance.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p><p>________________________________________\</p></div><h3><a id=38119 href="#38119">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2002 5:28:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., a440a@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; realm of the Weinriech effect of piano strings and the differences<br/>are<br/>&gt; certainly there; (mistuning unisons on a concert grand by this<br/>amount per<br/>&gt; string, which may result in perhaps a cumulative .2 or .3 cents<br/>phase factor<br/>&gt; will definately have an effect on sustain).<br/>&gt;     The same paradigns can be found in organ tuning, where pipes<br/>will &quot;draw&quot;<br/>&gt; the near pitch toward themselves.

What about, say,<br/>&gt; .03 cents?</p><p>   We have to ask ourselves, first, to &quot;make an actual difference&quot; in what?<br/>The pitch, the sustain or the apparent clarity of the resulting note?  The<br/>sustain and clarity can be noticeably altered by discrepancies of .1 to .3<br/>cents,  the pitch will need more to actually sound altered.<br/>    My machine,(a Sanderson Accu-tuner) is accurate to .1 cent, but that<br/>doesn&apos;t completely address the answer, since piano strings can&apos;t usually be<br/>played that accurately.  When the hammer first hits them, the oscillation<br/>amplitude initially creates a &quot;tighter&quot; string and the pitch will be higher.<br/>After a second or so, things will drop a certain amount into more of a steady<br/>state.  .1 cent is smaller than this temporal shift&apos;s range, so an amount of<br/>mistuning that &quot;makes a difference&quot; in the sustain may not have much effect<br/>on the sensation of pitch and no effect at all on the shorter duration note.<br/>Thus, .1 is the limit to my measurement accuracy and I don&apos;t know if smaller<br/>gradations are of practical use.<br/>   The mistuning that I have measured in my unison attempts rarely gets<br/>beyond .3 cents, and then only when I have a string problem.  (Tuners can<br/>&quot;bury&quot; extraneous string misbehaviour by mistuning one or two of the three<br/>strings in a unison and letting the phasing act as an aural &quot;veneer&quot; to<br/>create the impression of clarity).  When all three strings are exactly the<br/>same,(to an amount smaller than .1), the energy &quot;dump&quot; is more immediate than<br/>when they have enough out of phase to stiffen the bridge and increase the<br/>sustain.  See the Weinreich article in<br/><a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/">http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/</a><br/>    It is usual to have .1 or .2 cents in there, either between two strings<br/>that are each .1 cent away from a common point, or often,  one string that is<br/>.2 cents away from the other two which are matched.  This is why I tune two<br/>strings of the unison to the machine then aurally place the third.  It<br/>creates a more consistant set of unisons in terms of sustain and sound<br/>quality.</p><p>&gt;&gt;     The same paradigns can be found in organ tuning, where pipes will<br/>&gt;&quot;draw&quot;  the near pitch toward themselves.  Get too close to a ratio and the<br/>&gt;  instrument will take over.</p><p>&gt;Fascinating. Is there a name for this? It sounds as if you are saying an<br/>&gt;organ might adaptively tune itself if you use a mictrotemperament tuning.</p><p>   I think the term is &quot;drawing&quot; and results from physical proximity of one<br/>pipe to another in the ranks.  It is mostly a phenomenon that affects like<br/>notes on different ranks, so that when tuning one rank to another as unisons,<br/>the distance between the pipes can have an effect on accuracy.</p><p>&gt;  It seems to be a shortcoming of ET that the blandness inherent</p><p>&gt;in sameness can only be ameliorated by excessive stretching.</p><p>Paul asks:</p><p>how does that ameliorate the sameness? isn&apos;t the tuning equally</p><p>stretched no matter what key you&apos;re in?</p><p>    Yes, all keys are equally stretched, but I was trying to address why ET<br/>so often seems to need more &quot;stretch&quot; than a well-temperament to create the<br/>same amount of audience engagement.  In ET was stretching creates a<br/>stimulative direction of increasing tenseness as the pitches go up the scale.<br/> This supposedly creates &quot;sparkle&quot; or brilliance in the ear of the<br/>listener,(at least, so I am told).  The unequal tunings create a stimulative<br/>response by presenting various levels of dissonance in contrast to more<br/>consonant sounds.  This harmonic texture seems to be more psycho-emotively<br/>effective than ever-increasing sharpness.<br/>    As to the Bosendorfer of La Mont Young,  it was my understanding that it<br/>was the Imperial, which is larger than the normal concert grand and that it<br/>also has 97 keys. The lowest strings have fundamentals below 27 Hz and are<br/>there to stabilize the bridge at its bottom range.  There is no way to add<br/>string diameter sufficient to allow an octave lower pitch on a piano, the<br/>inharmonicity would be huge!<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=38148 href="#38148">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2002 10:05:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., a440a@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;    We have to ask ourselves, first, to &quot;make an actual difference&quot;<br/>in what?<br/>&gt; The pitch, the sustain or the apparent clarity of the resulting<br/>note?
