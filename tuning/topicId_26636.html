Just joined. Enthusiastic! In my view the fundamental flaw<br/>in Schoenberg&apos;s pantonality, as he preferred to call it, was that it<br/>elevated the fudged tuning of a tempered system to the status of a<br/>first principle of musical composition. I believe that the greatest<br/>composers throughout history intuitively respected what we might call<br/>the &quot;AURAL ERGONOMICS&quot; of human musical perception.</p><p>This is admittedly a &quot;fuzzy&quot; area, since perception is highly<br/>variable from person to person both in terms of its potential and its<br/>development. However, assuming that the great masters used their own<br/>perceptions as a basis for their art, this would presumably still<br/>impose certain limits on composition, even if rather lofty.</p><p>Perhaps we should note that the great composers of antiquity were<br/>also beholden to their markets, refined in tastes as they were,<br/>having had their perceptions educated and refined through a long<br/>history of state-supported fine arts, of which music was not the<br/>least important by any stretch. I therefore agree that some limit in<br/>the human mental ear for processing musical information is inevitably<br/>a part of any definition of what WILL be perceived as musical or<br/>unmusical.</p><p>Perhaps we should consider that a dynamic concept of tonality such as<br/>Schoenberg proposed is beyond the perceptual grasp of most audiences,<br/>as opposed to simpler relationships to constant tonal centers. If we<br/>wish to become such elitists that we perform only for ourselves, I<br/>suppose anything goes, but I wonder how much even we would really<br/>enjoy that, and when does it become just a dry, intellectual game of<br/>one-up-manship?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert Wendell</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul (Erlich)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since there is so much &quot;static&quot; over on the &quot;Crazy Music&quot; list<br/>which<br/>&gt; is, indeed, appropriately named &quot;Crazy...&quot; I am reposting this for,<br/>&gt; hopefully, intelligent discussion over here...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/820">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/820</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://thinkingapplied.com/tonality_folder/tonality.htm">http://thinkingapplied.com/tonality_folder/tonality.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Musical relationships arise from a succession of events unfolding<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;time.
