There seems to be a great<br/>interest in tunings and everthing about them, so I thought I&apos;d let anybody<br/>interested know about our new invention.<br/>Basically, it is a single stringed movables capo system that we install into<br/>guitars.  Each string gets a tiny bead which slides up and down the string,<br/>and is held at any fret it is left at.  All six beads slide over the nut, so<br/>any combination can be used from zero to all six.  This lets the player set<br/>up any chord as a base.  Not true down tuning, more like &apos;uptuning&apos;, when<br/>used in combination, the limits are set only by the players imagination.<br/>There are photos and details of our guitar at the super easy to remember<br/>address of <a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/abacuscapo">www3.sympatico.ca/abacuscapo</a><br/>Our guitars have only been played by a handful of players, and seeing as<br/>though we are always striving to make it better, we&apos;d love to hear any<br/>comments you may have.<br/>Thank You<br/>Jonathan Sims<br/>Abacus Capo</p></div>
