The first<br/>thing I did once I got the email up and running was join the tuning<br/>list which had just relocated to Yahoo. I was psyched to finally have<br/>immediate access to others who were interested in this topic.</p><p>It took me a long, long time to get the hang of email, the medium was<br/>far more difficult than I ever would&apos;ve anticipated. But the tuning<br/>list was even more of a shock!</p><p>I was used to artist types. Years of trading tapes on the home taper<br/>circuit and frequenting artists&apos; collaborative like the Noh Place and<br/>the WAG had given me a certain set of expectations, and I just assumed<br/>the communal vibe would be at least somewhat similar: creativity<br/>first. This was simply not the case. The vibe was stiff, dry and<br/>snippily pedagogic.</p><p>Bad as that may sound, it wasn&apos;t all bad however. There was a bright<br/>side. Amounts the dominant voices on the list were some uniquely<br/>knowledgeable folks, and this was probably one of the only places on<br/>the planet where some of these theoretical questions and issues, ones<br/>I&apos;d puzzled over on my own, were consistently addressed in a<br/>forthright manner. Lots of no-nonsense facts that were quite useful<br/>for anyone who was interested in the theoretical side of tuning.</p><p>The downside was obvious though--a stifling and curt atmosphere that<br/>fostered only that which lined up favorably with the dominant posters.<br/>The alienated outnumbered the enlightened, but so it went... each new<br/>clash a bit more caustic than the last.</p><p>The main gripe was that the vast majority of the posts had nothing to<br/>do with actual hands-on music making and even less to do with<br/>microtonality in any sort of a broad, holistic sense. If you wanted<br/>your posts to peek their heads out of the din, you&apos;d better be sure<br/>author it in the particular language and excessively narrow interests<br/>of the dominant posters.</p><p>Eventually the inevitable happened and the list split off into many<br/>disgruntled and more special interest type factions. This has helped<br/>ease tensions and foster diversity to some degree, but I think it&apos;s<br/>still a process that&apos;s feeling its way towards something better. It&apos;s<br/>better, but it could be better still.</p><p>I think projects like Jack Ligon&apos;s Microtonal Activist are a step in<br/>the right direction. Projects like these help take list contributors&apos;<br/>work out of the church of the converted and off to the internet masses<br/>in digestible sized portions. I&apos;m sorry, but the signal to noise ratio<br/>renders the list archives all but impenetrable to anyone with anything<br/>less than a stout streak of tuning fanaticism.</p><p>I think more work along the lines of TMA&apos;s digestible sized portions<br/>can only help--Joe Monzo&apos;s editorial and organizational work on Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s Fokker periodicity blocks and harmonic entropy posts would be<br/>another example of a fruitful collaboration that exists in a<br/>presentable form other than the archives.</p><p>A FAQ would help... any FAQ! The last effort kind of collapsed under<br/>the weight of its own ambitions and the usual acrimonious squabbling,<br/>but I bet we--we being the online tuning community who&apos;d be willing to<br/>participate--could get it done. It would probably take an appointed<br/>organizer though, someone who gets things done. (I like Monzo in this<br/>capacity, but whoever.)</p><p>Then there&apos;s music. Stunning music puts all doubts to rest. Just last<br/>night I was listening to the Tilson Thomas conducted Comedy, and with<br/>just those comparatively limited instances of quartertones, Ives says<br/>more about the usefulness of quartertones--and by demonstrable<br/>extension, all non-12 tunings--than the three years worth of posts<br/>I&apos;ve read giving quartertones the back of their hand.</p><p>Effective music brushes even the sturdiest and the most sublime of<br/>theoretical edifices aside, and it does so with alarming ease... it<br/>steamrolls everything in its path... it clears the palate and resets<br/>the clocks.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=31880 href="#31880">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2001 3:54:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p>But the tuning<br/>&gt; list was even more of a shock!</p><p>The music people I knew were generally math-phobic and clueless about tuning issues; moreover, they were clueless about the fact that they were clueless.

This was simply not the case. The vibe was stiff, dry and<br/>&gt; snippily pedagogic.</p><p>Those were obviously good circuits you were on. There are lots of<br/>&quot;music&quot; circles which are the equivalent of &quot;stiff, dry and<br/>snippily pedagogic&quot; to anyone who isn&apos;t a &quot;bebop nazi&quot;, &quot;big-hair<br/>guitar wanker&quot;, &quot;serialist&quot;, etc, etc...</p><p>This is true in all the arts, artist types are sometimes no less<br/>closed minded than non-artists (sometimes moreso).</p><p>&gt; Lots of no-nonsense facts that were quite useful<br/>&gt; for anyone who was interested in the theoretical side of tuning.</p><p>Bingo! I guess there are a few who have had it move their music<br/>in new directions. Perhaps I&apos;ll be one of them, although at this<br/>point the main change has been to my listenning habits, which is<br/>a worthy enough change.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The downside was obvious though--a stifling and curt atmosphere that<br/>&gt; fostered only that which lined up favorably with the dominant posters.<br/>&gt; The alienated outnumbered the enlightened, but so it went... each new<br/>&gt; clash a bit more caustic than the last.</p><p>I&apos;ll admit that the clashes that are bothersome are when those who have<br/>paid a lot of dues in the xenharmonic business are e-ttacked by some who<br/>have paid next to no dues in said world.</p><p>That said, some of us are more patient with these things than others.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The main gripe was that the vast majority of the posts had nothing to<br/>&gt; do with actual hands-on music making and even less to do with<br/>&gt; microtonality in any sort of a broad, holistic sense.</p><p>I don&apos;t know, lists of cents could be seen as the equivalent of &quot;try<br/>this cool lick on this chord&quot;. However, the ease with which anyone<br/>can generate such lists (compared to the difficulty of actually playing<br/>with one) means that many more lists are going to be generated than<br/>informed conversation about said lists or musical examples made from<br/>such lists.</p><p>As far as &quot;microtonality in any sort of a broad, holistic sense&quot;, I&apos;ve<br/>gotten the impression that no such thing exists, which is not surprising,<br/>since I don&apos;t think you can talk about most single tunings in such a<br/>manner. When you talk about a FAQ, I attempted to figure out why<br/>someone would be motivated  to get out of the 12tet box, and found at<br/>least a half-dozen viewpoints represented on this list, all of which<br/>would lead in different JI, RI, ET, overtone etc, etc, directions.</p><p>&gt; If you wanted<br/>&gt; your posts to peek their heads out of the din, you&apos;d better be sure<br/>&gt; author it in the particular language and excessively narrow interests<br/>&gt; of the dominant posters.</p><p>Or start a thread that non-dominant posters are interested in, or take<br/>it to one of the spin-off lists.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Effective music brushes even the sturdiest and the most sublime of<br/>&gt; theoretical edifices aside, and it does so with alarming ease... it<br/>&gt; steamrolls everything in its path... it clears the palate and resets<br/>&gt; the clocks.</p><p>Wonderfully put. I didn&apos;t want to let this post drift off into<br/>the ozone. I see it as important as the Bob Moses article you pointed<br/>out.</p><p>In agreement, I&apos;d say that even &quot;not so effective&quot; music can have<br/>the same effect. The best learning for me has been to take something<br/>back to the piano and try it out. If it doesn&apos;t make music for me,<br/>then whether it makes sense as a theory or not is a bit less<br/>interesting. But this is true with ANY music theory, not just tuning<br/>theory.</p><p>Similarly, there is a lot of things that are dimly related to theory<br/>that make for good music. &quot;Passing chords&quot; in classical harmony<br/>is really a punt as a theoretic term! &quot;Side slipping&quot; as a jazz<br/>technique is similarly saying &quot;what you are doing&quot; without saying<br/>anything about why.

I like the Beatles, Yes, Phish, I play folk,<br/>&gt; &gt; blues, &quot;jazz&quot; you might say; I like to make people feel something<br/>&gt; &gt; with music. _The_ people, not just a few of them. And I want to<br/>&gt; hear<br/>&gt; &gt; something new once in a while, something that stands up on its own<br/>&gt; &gt; and isn&apos;t just a gimmick or trick.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; May Santa&apos;s bag be filled with drums and microtonal guitars for<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt; the teenage boys and girls to play with!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

When<br/>&gt; improvising, I like to express myself with, and build upon, the<br/>wacky<br/>&gt; noises that result from manipulating my guitar in unpredicable ways.<br/>&gt; I have to inject a bit of experimentation, a bit of randomness, in<br/>&gt; order to keep it fresh and interesting for me and for the listener.<br/>&gt; The next time I play, I might use what I learned in a previous round<br/>&gt; of experimenting, and eventually that will become predictable -- so<br/>I<br/>&gt; keep experimenting!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But that doesn&apos;t mean I play without knowing what I&apos;m doing! That<br/>&gt; kind of &quot;freedom&quot; does nothing for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

You&apos;re not going to get from Tatum what you get from Bach and<br/>vice versa, and all you have to do is stretch this line of reasoning a<br/>wee bit to see that Bach didn&apos;t say it all. It&apos;s hysterics to think<br/>otherwise. Charming, but hysterical!</p><p>All manner of sounds can be used effectively, i.e., musically. This<br/>has been proven time and time again, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s any more<br/>difficult than thinking of orchestration and instrument color<br/>stretched to certain extremes. These things have been going on for<br/>quite some time, and it&apos;s folly to think that they&apos;re just shock value<br/>tricks of the inept and the uninspired.</p><p>Great music will be great music forever, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s<br/>the only music forever! It&apos;s a big world, and there&apos;s a lot of<br/>astonishing music out there.</p><p>When I was younger I was an absolutely voracious listener, and I tried<br/>to get as much in my ears as I could. I spent every spare cent I had<br/>on records, went to every show I could get to, I spent countless hours<br/>in the record library of my local public radio station... when I think<br/>back over the years I realize that I&apos;ve been touched by so much music<br/>that it&apos;s just ridiculous.</p><p>My wife hosted a weekly world music program, Music of the Whole Earth.<br/>Much of this music was as alien to the sensibilities as any I&apos;d ever<br/>heard, made John Cage sound tame by comparison.

Also audiences are almost<br/>infinitely more willing to receive any sort of sound that flaunts<br/>their expectations when it forms some sort of _pattern_ -- if not a<br/>stereotypical tension/release pattern, then at least some permutation<br/>of repetition and variation that is neither too predicable nor too<br/>unpredictable.

If, indeed, your study and<br/>listening of Bach, as a maker of deep music, prepares you for a<br/>broader experience of other musics, can&apos;t that same phenomenon occur<br/>for another person, stimulated by another composer? Of course it can.<br/>In fact, as you say:</p><p>&gt; Every deep musical experience sets us up for deeper appreciation of<br/>&gt; the musical value of anything else good in music.</p><p>And that must certainly vary according to the listener, as to<br/>what &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;musical value&quot; mean.</p><p>If anyone wants to extol the virtues of working within limits, that<br/>is certainly their right.

I was not contrasting two specific<br/>composers, but if - and that is a moderately large &apos;if&apos; - I were to<br/>do so, I think it is safe to say that Bach is safer than Cage, for<br/>no other reason than in an indeterminate score you have a greater<br/>chance of not creating a compelling experience than one that is pre-<br/>determined.</p><p>And, lest anyone read more ideas into what I have written than<br/>intended, I am not a big Cage fan; of his music, I generally prefer<br/>his work up to and including the prepared piano works. But he does<br/>fall into my category of people who, while not my favorites<br/>for &apos;experiencing&apos; (i.e. listening to, seeing their plays, reading<br/>their prose), he is also one of those that I am very glad lived and<br/>developed his ideas and ideals.</p><p>&gt; I think the idea that we should pat ourselves on the back for<br/>&gt; liking what is not &quot;safe&quot; makes no sense.

I am not asking you to be self-congratulatory,<br/>but I am offering my viewpoint. It is my feeling that our arts, and<br/>therefore our lives, are enriched the most by the art that strives to<br/>break boundaries. It is maybe an idealogical position, to be sure,<br/>but (for me) everytime the idea of working within limits, obeying the<br/>rules, toeing the line ... it may be semantic usage, but I think it<br/>generates a mindset that is less likely to look to new frontiers.</p><p>And - to be patently clear - I like things when they are good,<br/>and much music I love dearly is *not* always pushing the envelope. It<br/>is not an &apos;either/or&apos; situation, and it is not the case that non-<br/>questing works fail to find favor with my inner self. It is simply<br/>that I believe, very fervently, in the search beyond limits, in<br/>however that word may be applied.</p><p>&gt; The last century does not convince me that the quest for<br/>&gt; originality at all costs, and safety last, is a good idea</p><p>Good, you have your parameters set, and that is perfectly fine.<br/>Again, I did *not* say &quot;at all costs&quot;.

You imply that your research, your<br/>reason for investigation, is going beyond the merely practical and<br/>commonplace musical practice. If people want to make music that<br/>affects others deeply, how can you impune their motives at the same<br/>time you diminish an interest in creative solutions to making art?</p><p>I realize the two quotes from you do *not* come from this particular<br/>topic, but they indicate an investigatory fervor in research that<br/>finds an opposite aesthetic in the application of that research (i.e.<br/>to make music). If this is so far out of context as to be<br/>meaningless, please ignore and accept my apologies.</p><p>&gt; I think on the whole the 18th century was healthier, when anyone<br/>&gt; felt free to copy anyone else or to repeat themselves.</p><p>You are welcome to that thought; I find repeating the past is not the<br/>answer for me, and I think little good comes of it.</p><p>&gt; In any case its the 21st century now, and we are all supposed to<br/>&gt; have gotten over modernism.</p><p>I have rarely, if ever, done what &quot;we are all supposed to&quot; do.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=32074 href="#32074">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2001 4:54:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>I don&apos;t think too many folks like things because they&apos;re bad... sure,<br/>some people play off of shocking or offending people, but I think it&apos;s<br/>a slim minority that would let that be the main impetus of their art.</p><p>When it comes to art, I really do think most people are trying to do<br/>something good.

But<br/>this is just a detail.  What makes music one of the highest<br/>expressions of being human has nothing to do with considerations<br/>on this level.

Bach&apos;s keyboard music isn&apos;t even in<br/>the style of his time.  He took the German toccata (then almost<br/>dead) and made something, which when transcribed for string<br/>quartet, could have been composed yesterday.  He did one-offs in<br/>the French and Italian styles -- which sound nothing like French<br/>or Italian music -- they sound like Bach.  His chamber music is<br/>in the style of his time, but it doesn&apos;t sound right either.<br/>Listen to Handel, Telemann, or any of the other German chamber<br/>music of Bach&apos;s time... the Brandenberg concerti seem like the LSD<br/>version to me.  Not that Handel or Telemann would have been<br/>excluded by this maxim of 20th-century art, either.</p><p>Mozart revolutionized the orchestra, and I am told, the opera.<br/>Much of his music seems plainly Viennese to our ears, but compare<br/>his keyboard sonatas with those of Clementi.

In this view the most interesting music would use and<br/>extend the tools of the day.
