But now, how hard would it be to play<br/>&gt; 22 or 19? How flexible is flute intonation?</p><p>Well, I have a regular flute with no &quot;quartertone add-ons&quot; here and I<br/>clearly remember the moment when I tried to play 5-EDO or 7_EDO with it<br/>(which are, of course, the most distant systems from 12-EDO in terms of<br/>intonation properties). The most effective way to do this is to rapidly<br/>change the angle between your lips and the embouchure hole of the flute --<br/>turning the embouchure hole towards you decreases the pitch slightly, while<br/>tunring it away from you increases the pitch. This is what flutists usually<br/>always do while playing as the flute itself cannot be, for more reasons,<br/>tuned in 100% exact 12-EDO (if you take C4 as the reference tone, for<br/>example, then E4 is some 5 cents lower or so, E5 is about 10 cents lower, C5<br/>is about 10 cents higher, C#5 is almost 20 cents higher). If I wanted to<br/>change the pitch by such large amounts like more than 40 cents, I had to<br/>turn the flute &quot;here and there&quot; in much greater distances than usual, which<br/>took quite some time. Yes, you can play 5-EDO or 7-EDO on a flute but. A)<br/>this can&apos;t be done in legato or in fast passages, and B) the tone timbre is<br/>going to vary during such a piece, and C) you almost reach the limits of<br/>playability. For example, to get the tone between the standard F and F# in<br/>two different timbres, you can use the fingering for F and turn the flute<br/>very much away from you (or rather the embouchure hole, to be more precise),<br/>and then use the fingering for F# and turn it very much towards you.<br/>Concerning my personal experience with this, I think I would need a break of<br/>about 100 ms between the tones to be able to find the pitches.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=71210 href="#71210">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2007 3:41:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; For example, to get the tone between the standard F and F# in<br/>&gt; two different timbres, you can use the fingering for F and turn the flute<br/>&gt; very much away from you (or rather the embouchure hole, to be more<br/>precise),<br/>&gt; and then use the fingering for F# and turn it very much towards you.<br/>&gt; Concerning my personal experience with this, I think I would need a break<br/>of<br/>&gt; about 100 ms between the tones to be able to find the pitches.</p><p>Some flutes using the so-called &quot;French system&quot; have holes in the keys and<br/>these can be covered or uncovered or partially covered with your fingers.<br/>This is how one of my favorite flutists, Tilmann Dehnhard from Berlin,<br/>managed to do glissandi in his &quot;Breath III&quot;. The keys on my flute don&apos;t have<br/>any holes in them so I don&apos;t have much experience with this.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
