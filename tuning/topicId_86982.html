So I posted the 12 tet version of the performance and the opinions were divided as to what was better. In response I posted a mash up with the left ear 12 tet and the right ear Lucy tuned. This really brings out the differences and creates a nice phasing for the most part.</p><p>An online player + download of the mash up + video with Lucy tuned pianoteq is here:</p><p><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=103">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=103</a></p><p>Have a good day.</p><p>Chris</p></div>
