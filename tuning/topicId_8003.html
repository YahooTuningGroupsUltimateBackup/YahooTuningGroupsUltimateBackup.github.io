Maybe. For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;m confident that I know and can<br/>sing the difference between a melodic 700 fifth and a melodic 702 fifth. I&apos;m<br/>aware that the Harvard Dictionary article on &quot;Tempered Tuning&quot; says that the<br/>difference is &quot;imperceptible&quot; but I don&apos;t buy it. Very likely there are many<br/>other places where 2 cents would be imperceptible, but not between a &quot;locked<br/>in fifth&quot; (even melodically) and something close to a locked in fifth.</p><p>After having sung many thousands of harmonic fifths, it is not difficult to<br/>imagine one in advance of moving to its other pitch melodically. Also, after<br/>arriving at the other pitch one&apos;s memory of the pitch just left is still<br/>vivid enough to tune to it.</p><p>Now, if the statistics are drawn from singers who know the difference, the<br/>result will surely be different than if drawn from singers who don&apos;t. But in<br/>any case I&apos;ll certainly not close the subject until after the statistics are<br/>in.</p></div>
