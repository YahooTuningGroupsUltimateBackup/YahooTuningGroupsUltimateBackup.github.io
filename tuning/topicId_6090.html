Anything else would be out of tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sorry, I should have elaborated.  Pardon my ignorance, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;understand, unless it&apos;s voice leading considerations (?), but the minor 7th<br/>&gt;in the Dmin7 chord is in tune at 9/5.  There&apos;st more stuff on the web I<br/>&gt;should read  before asking more inane questions in this direction, but all<br/>&gt;suggestions of good reading on why certain ratios are best in one chord and<br/>&gt;not another would be most welcome.</p><p>Yes, C as 9/5 relative to D is in tune in D-7 in the key of C. That&apos;s<br/>because D-7 is a elaborated version, or extension, of the basic subdominant<br/>F major triad, and D is added to the F triad in such a way as to make a<br/>minor triad with the F and A as they are already tuned in the F triad. On<br/>the other hand F is added to the dominant G triad in such a way as to make<br/>the new chord less stable, or more tense, than the G major triad. If F were<br/>tuned as 9/5 relative to G, the G7 chord would be too stable for its<br/>purpose of drawing us back to the tonic C. At some time in the near future<br/>I will write about cases where the 7th in a dominant chord tunes other than<br/>as 7/4 relative to the root. The examples will be different from those<br/>we&apos;ve discussed in the past few days.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Comments?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Get yourself some singers. Or, take a look at <a href="http://www.justonic.com">www.justonic.com</a> for some<br/>&gt;&gt;software that I think might do what you want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Unfortunately Justonic won&apos;t integrate into my system at all (doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;support my synths, runs on a different platform than my sequencer, etc.),<br/>&gt;otherwise I&apos;ld experiment with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But my biggest interest is to understand whatever theory there is behind<br/>&gt;tuning, at least as far as there are physical reasons for some things<br/>&gt;sounding good and others sounding like they should change soon - up to the<br/>&gt;point where it turns into individual aesthetics, cultures, etc. (which I&apos;m<br/>&gt;getting the impression happens fairly quickly :)).  All references greatly<br/>&gt;welcomed (I&apos;ve got lots of URLs from this group and searching the web,  but<br/>&gt;if anybody has compiled a list that would be great).</p><p>I intend to write extensively about this topic. Until I do, I suggest that<br/>you pick up Gerald Eskelin&apos;s &quot;Lies My Music Teacher Told Me&quot;, which I think<br/>that you will find helpful and provocative.
