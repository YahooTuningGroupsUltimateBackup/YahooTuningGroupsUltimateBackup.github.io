This I have one sample of as being the most accurate at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/chopi.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/chopi.PDF</a><br/>which i got from Andrew tracy who father collected quite a few measurements in the mid forties but<br/>only had a set of tunings forks tuned 4 vibration apart. There has been much speculation about a<br/>cross communications via among other things the Chinese colonizing Madagascar from 100-700 AD.</p><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do you have measurements for the Thai &quot;7-equal&quot; scale to hand?</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=25043 href="#25043">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2001 3:24:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul!<br/>    Just like the chopi who think of their scale as equal, we have to remember that what equal<br/>means to us and what equal means to them might be quite different.</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; The Thai scale is _conceptually_ equal.

If one of the seven pentatonic &quot;key<br/>signatures&quot; sounds different than the others, that is a sign of<br/>inequality very similar to the standards for tuning 12-equal in the<br/>West.</p></div>
