I&apos;m using a<br/>15-note version, with the keys differing on the two manuals being D, Bb,<br/>and F#.</p><p>One dilemma of the tuning, which has the same range as standard Eb-G#<br/>meantone, is the impossibility of getting the suspended sonority D-G-A,<br/>e.g.</p><p>B4 A4    B4<br/>G4   F#4 G4<br/>D4       D4<br/>D3       G2<br/>   4 -3</p><p>to have _both_ the fifth and the fourth pure. The problem, of course, is<br/>that this tuning has only one version each of G and A, which have the<br/>small whole-tone of 10:9. Unfortunately, we need a 9:8 whole-tone to<br/>manage getting all three notes correct at the same time.</p><p>Does the omission of such a note from the tuning maybe mean the<br/>Renaissance theorists regarded this suspension -- a dissonance, of course,<br/>in a Renaissance as opposed to 13th-century or 20th-century setting where<br/>D-G-A can be independently euphonious -- as a point where a bit of<br/>tension from the Wolf fourth was acceptable? If so, this is a case where<br/>the Wolf is permitted above the bass itself.</p><p>There are other dilemmas: is it appropriate, for the sake of simplifying<br/>hand motion, to accept a Pythagorean major sixth at a momentary cadence<br/>point when the same sonority includes an augmented fourth, for example?</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ve already learned well that D and G are the main &quot;pivot points&quot;<br/>for shifting manuals; maybe playing in JI is a bit like solmization or<br/>something.</p><p>All in all, I&apos;m content with meantone, the usual 16th-century solution --<br/>but those beatless concords are beguiling, and the fact Zarlino discusses<br/>such a keyboard indicates that it is also a part of Renaissance<br/>musical culture.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
