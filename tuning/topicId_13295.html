I refer you to the end of this post for a<br/>follow up.</p><p>There are however a number of issues pertinent to the related topics of sound and psychic<br/>anatomy and physiology which I feel are important, relevant and ultimately of interest to<br/>members of this list. For most of what follows I am indebted to the essential Alain Danielou&apos;s<br/>&apos;Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales&apos; ( Oriental Books Reprint Corporation, New Delhi<br/>1979 ), his &apos;NorthernIndian Music&apos; (don&apos;t have the book at hand ) and to W.A. Mathieu&apos;s<br/>&apos;Harmonic Experience&apos; ( Inner Traditions International Rochester, Vermont, 1997 ).</p><p>In the Indian classical tradition, every pitch  relative to a tonic drone ( in otherwords,<br/>every dyad ) carries a specific  emotional charge. Furthermore, these pitches fit into five<br/>main groups; shining or illustrious, soft, abundant, moderate and compassionate. The Indian<br/>system is essentially  5 - limit , with 66 srutis ( notes ), of which 22 are the most<br/>frequent. Here is a 31 note slice of the lattice:-</p><p>(--  means lower by two commas,  - means lower by one comma,  + means raise by a comma,  ++<br/>raise by two, n means natural).</p><p>Fsharp--        Dflat--        Aflat-        Eflat-         Bflat-</p><p>\                     \                \                  \                 \</p><p>An                 En             Bn            Fsharp-       Dflat-</p><p>\                    \                \                  \                  \<br/>         Dflat-         Aflat n      Eflat n          Bflat n        Fn<br/>Cn                Gn              Dn             A+               E+        B+<br/>                                  \               \                     \<br/>\               \<br/>                                 B+         Fsharp n       Dflat n      Aflat+      Eflat+<br/>                                     \               \                       \<br/>\                 \<br/>                                    D+        A++              E++        B++        Fsharp+</p><p>In ratios this gives us:-</p><p>25/18    25/24    25/16        75/64       225/128</p><p>\             \            \                \                 \</p><p>5/3        5/4        5/8          45/32        135/128</p><p>\          \            \                  \                 \<br/>                                256/243   128/81      32/27    16/9         4/3<br/>1/1        3/2        9/8          27/16            81/64        243/128<br/>                                                    \                 \<br/>\             \           \<br/>                                                 256/135     64/45     16/15       8/5<br/>6/5<br/>                                                        \                 \<br/>\            \           \<br/>                                                     256/225     128/75     32/25    48/25<br/>36/25</p><p>The qualities are as follows; from 1/1 to 243/128 on the central line of fifths, the quality<br/>is described as active (sunshine, strength, joy). &gt;From 4/3 left to 256/243 the quality is<br/>passive (moonlight, beauty, peace).  The line above is of the quality of sensitiveness or<br/>emotion. The prime limit 5 therefore introduces tenderness. The top line is of the quality of<br/>great beauty. The line below the middle is described as ranging from charm and liveliness at<br/>the 256/153 end to passion and desire at the other. The ratios on bottom line are considered<br/>to be extremely active. Furthermore the system is closed. If you go so far in one direction,<br/>you eventually meet the qualities of another direction.</p><p>I should point out here that these emotional tags have come about through centuries of<br/>consensus between practicing musicians who have observed the effects of their music on their<br/>audiences. I would personally be wary of discounting these finding - listen to Shubha Mudgal&apos;s<br/>Monsoon Raga &apos;Raga Gaud Malhar&quot;. (reference on request).</p><p>A spiritual and uplifting effect is generally sought in raga and so the ++ and -- series of<br/>intervals are rarely used as the former expresses harshnness and brutality, the latter intense<br/>depression or sadness. The beautiful part of all this is that  it is virtually impossible to<br/>build musically useful scales in which all the notes have a similar expression. Hence the<br/>range of emotions in raga, and in other musics.</p><p>I would like to draw two threads from this. First, I feel that it  might be worthwile<br/>exploring the correlation between the findings of the recent harmonic entropy studies and<br/>these fields of affective sonance, in particular the otonal / utonal  issues. This would be a<br/>challenging project for my less than virtuosic mathematics.</p><p>Secondly, sound is in essence vibration. The chakras are our individual system&apos;s vertically<br/>aligned  vortexes of energy. They pick up subtle and gross vibrations from the cosmic and<br/>physical environment,  transform them and then they distribute the energy throughout our<br/>system. A healthy system is one in which the chakras are well tuned. This implies many things,<br/>mental and emotional stability, appropriate diet, thought, speech and action. But,<br/>particularly at the emotional level (one of several levels of our existence according to yogic<br/>psychic anatomy and physiology) physical sound can heal, uplift and inspire. Hence the myriad<br/>forms of music therapy, including recreational listening. Take chanting. One technique<br/>involves 108 ( 3 cubed times 2 squared ) recitations of a seed mantra (a syllable) intimately<br/>related to a specific chakra. One recitation consists of timbre ( roughly, the uttered<br/>syllable), frequency and amplitude. The presence of a drone might be provided by an instrument<br/>or by sliding up to the syllable from an implied fundamental. The adept can achieve wonderful<br/>results. Now, which intervals as we perceive them from a given fundamental will activate which<br/>chakras?  Much research has been done into the qualities of the various mantras, but I know of<br/>very little relating to the intervals. Perhaps such research would uncover some of the<br/>mysteries of music and emotional effect.</p><p>Naturally there will be sceptics who will dismiss all this and empiricists who will demand<br/>proof. The proof can only be had  by direct experience. Listen, sing, chant and find a justly<br/>intoned instrument.  It is possible that the music of great composers, in particular their<br/>harmonic and melodic movement, hints at the resonances of pure chant and at the emotional<br/>lattices shown earlier. This is why we are moved. Bach&apos;s music moves through harmonic and<br/>melodic space pointing us to emotional states particularly effectively , as does Charlie<br/>Parker&apos;s for that matter. Or try the Kyrie from Johannes Ockeghem&apos;s Missa Fors Seulement.<br/>Grown men (and women) weep listening to this  as they do to raga. It is said that as you<br/>travel the spiritual path you are attracted to music of greater purity, which can mean many<br/>things to many people. I believe that much of the purity of music stems from the tuning of the<br/>music or the tuning to which the music points. This is why we all love Just Intonation (don&apos;t<br/>we).</p><p>Finally, I have several excellent powerful daily routines for tuning and aligning the chakras<br/>which I would be pleased to share off list by individual email. These are excellent for<br/>improving musical awareness, poise and grace. My in progress website will have a page on<br/>similar techniques.  I would like to share the observation that some of us are more creative<br/>in nature and we work a lot from the visuddhi (throat) chakra. Others are more intellectual<br/>and analytical and work more from the ajna chakra (third eye). This is very beautiful. Before<br/>I do anything important such as compose, practice, perform or post to this list, I like to<br/>take my energy to the heart chakra, the Anahata, in which lies the pure and primal sound, and<br/>which lies in the very centre of our seven (that prime again) principal chakras. It can also<br/>help to keep down the flames.</p><p>Peace to everyone.</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 11:39:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Alison Monteith &lt;<br/>alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Furthermore the system is closed.

Or are you just relying on Danielou&apos;s<br/>&gt; word? (He had a penchant for fantasy.)</p><p>I know about Danielou&apos;s reputation.  I have, however spent many years living with and learning<br/>from Asian and particularly Gujerati Hindu musicians and yoga practitioners. I&apos;ve never really<br/>questioned the truth of what I learned as I had faith in my teachers and in their methods. But<br/>I also know that many Indian musicians have varying opinions over tuning and over the effect<br/>of the srutis. I was taught that if you are still enough and listen well you will hear well<br/>and that the intention and spirit of the performer has a great bearing on the effect.  This<br/>has of course been construed as a cop-out by some critics but I find the idea of the artist<br/>and audience seeking the highest in themselves to be most delicious. Also some music will be<br/>confusing and some performers will play confusing music - both have their charm. Naturally I<br/>don&apos;t mean to imply that perfectly poised raga is any better music than the best of another<br/>idiom.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would personally be wary of discounting these finding - listen to<br/>&gt; Shubha Mudgal&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; Monsoon Raga &apos;Raga Gaud Malhar&quot;.

First, I feel that it<br/>&gt; might be worthwile<br/>&gt; &gt; exploring the correlation between the findings of the recent<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy studies and<br/>&gt; &gt; these fields of affective sonance, in particular the otonal /<br/>&gt; utonal  issues.

As I am not a scientist as such I can only suggest a crude method of comparing the<br/>peaks and troughs of the harmonic entropy curves with their associated expressions and looking<br/>for patterns. I just have a curious desire, probably as a result of following the list<br/>discussions, to see if there are any mathematical patterns to the Hindu system. One limitation<br/>is the 5-limit of the system, though I have a list of 66 srutis, with at least one  11 and one<br/>13 limit  interval. . If these intervals have associated qualities, perhaps things would be<br/>more interesting. I&apos;ll trawl through my notes. 7-limit intervals are absent as far as I<br/>remember. The use of higher primes is in the &apos;esoteric&apos; department and  out of my realm.<br/>Nonetheless that doesn&apos;t stop the rest of us from discussing our subjective feelings about<br/>intervals based on higher primes. I will post the details I have when my website is up and<br/>running.</p><p>I also have a proposal for a general bass and treble clef notation for 22 tet. It is<br/>incomplete in that I haven&apos;t credited your good self with the original paper and terminology.<br/>I have attached a PICT file and an htm file. and  If none of these opens I could post a<br/>Sibelius &quot;Scorch&quot; file to your website that you could open with a downloaded plug-in.
