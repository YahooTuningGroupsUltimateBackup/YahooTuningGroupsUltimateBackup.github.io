Strictly proper but oh so close to not being so... is their<br/>&gt;some agreed upon practical range to draw the line with scales that<br/>&gt;might recognize these tiny commatic differences that would perhaps<br/>&gt;only trivially distinguish them from being strictly proper or just<br/>&gt;proper?</p><p>[Paul Erlich wrote...]<br/>&gt;Dan, much as with consistency, propriety does involve a very sharp boundary,<br/>&gt;and crossing that boundary by a very small amount, while possibly having no<br/>&gt;audible effect, can amount to a change from a strictly proper scale to a<br/>&gt;proper one to an improper one. I was once bothered by the fact that the<br/>&gt;Pythagorean diatonic scale was improper, but it turns out that Rothenberg<br/>&gt;believed that as long as the worst impropriety (in this case, a Pythagorean<br/>&gt;comma) was to small to be perceived (since you&apos;re comparing B-f with f-b in<br/>&gt;this case, it would be hard to perceive the difference), the scale is<br/>&gt;essentially perceived as proper. Carl, am I representing Rothenberg<br/>&gt;correctly here?</p><p>I admit I don&apos;t have a good grasp of Rothenberg&apos;s treatment of these types of cases, throughout his work.  I addressed the problem, as regards propriety, by creating measures that work on logarithmic pitch space rather than the number of intervals involved.  They are implemented in the &quot;show data&quot; section of Scala 1.6 as &quot;Lumma stability&quot; and &quot;impropriety factor&quot;.  They are explained in the following excerpt from an un-published paper I wrote, where they are called &quot;Lumma stability&quot; and &quot;Lumma propriety&quot;...</p><p>&quot;Lumma propriety and Lumma stability are also easy.  Again, we&apos;ll use our log-frequency ruler, and again, we&apos;ll make a list of all the intervals in the interval matrix and mark them off on the ruler.  This time ... we&apos;ll draw line segments on our ruler with colored pencil, using the marks as endpoints.  We connect all marks belonging to the same scale degree with a single line, using a different color for each scale degree.  Lumma propriety is then the portion of the ruler that has no pencil on it -- the portion of the octave that is not covered by scale degrees.  Lumma stability is the portion of the ruler that is more than singly covered -- the part where different colors overlap -- subtracted from 1.  The idea being that when two scale degrees overlap, the listener will not be able to distinguish them in all cases -- that&apos;s a loss of stability.  Lumma propriety measures how well-distinguished the non-overlapping degrees are.&quot;</p><p>My measures are not intended to replace Rothenberg&apos;s -- both are useful.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
