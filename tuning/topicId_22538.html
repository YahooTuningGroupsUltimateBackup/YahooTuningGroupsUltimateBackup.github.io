I wonder if you may be misunderstanding the role of grounding in John&apos;s system.</p><p>Firstly, the grounding can only have as many notes as are specified in the input file. The MIDI<br/>sequences John has been retuning start with only 12 notes per octave, specified using MIDI<br/>note numbers. So for these sequences it wouldn&apos;t be possible to use a grounding tuning with<br/>more than 12 notes per octave.</p><p>I suggested to John that if the score (for a work of common-practice or Renaissance music)<br/>distinguishes, say, G# from Ab, then he should ground them separately, using as many notes in<br/>the grounding tuning (which will typically be meantone or meantone-like) as notated by the<br/>composer. Of course, as he&apos;s working from MIDI files, not scores, he doesn&apos;t have access to this<br/>notation information -- one would have to input the pieces in a different formatted.</p><p>But you&apos;re referring to using 72-tET, a tuning which distinguishes comma differences, as a<br/>ground. Before one did that, one would need to go into the piece and make the (usually<br/>arbitrary) decision of where to put how many comma shifts, which whole tones are 9:8 and which<br/>are 10:9, etc., in order to make definite which note in the score is to be grounded to which 72-tET<br/>pitch. Of course, once you&apos;ve gone through that process, you&apos;ve pretty much got a JI version of<br/>the piece already, so what&apos;s the point in adaptively tuning it? On the other hand, if you want to<br/>use adaptive tuning to eliminate comma drifts and shifts, and perhaps to even out the melodic<br/>whole tones, then quantifying to 72-tET would be shooting yourself in the foot.</p><p>Now, Monz, let&apos;s say for the moment that there&apos;s not one other person on earth who, like me,<br/>would ever be disturbed by 10 to 22 cent shifts in the pitch of a note. Still, why would you want<br/>to have the full-comma pitch shifts rather than not having them? John deLaubenfels can achieve<br/>vertical JI to any desired degree of accuracy with his current methods, whether grounding to<br/>12-tET or to a 12-tone COFT (or larger COFTs for enharmonic distinctions as in a possible<br/>future score-input-based version). As an additional effect, the full-comma shifts (or any shifts of<br/>10 cents or more) are eliminated. You&apos;ve pointed out a case where your ears don&apos;t mind when<br/>the full-comma shift is there. But do your ears complain when it isn&apos;t there? In other words, what<br/>I&apos;m asking is, why would you _want_ the full-comma shifts if there&apos;s no advantage, nothing to<br/>gain, in having them there?</p></div><h3><a id=22602 href="#22602">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2001 5:33:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22538.html#22596">/tuning/topicId_22538.html#22596</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Monz wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt; Would it be possible or make any sense to use 72-EDO as<br/>&gt; &gt; your ground?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Monz.

I<br/>have some new ideas about how to approach the problem, but they&apos;re<br/>unfortunately computationally intensive and also not that quick to<br/>program.  *sigh*...</p><p>JdL</p></div>
