It is a tiny prog, like a driver, that takes midi output of any prog, and<br/>sends them to midi input of any other prog. Download <a href="http://mdlbk251.zip">mdlbk251.zip</a> from<br/>ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/PROGRAMS/MSWINDOWS</p><p>Run the program Hwmdcabl.exe , and it will add extra ouput and input devices to the In and<br/>Out menus, such as LB1, and LB2. Then you can send the<br/>output of one program to LB1, and choose the same loop back line, LB1, as the input for the other.<br/>)</p><p>Then you edit the notes as usual, and when you click the play button, instead of going<br/>directly to soundcard, you hear it through FTS, i.e. in whatever scale / mode you have<br/>selected there.</p><p>You can also hear it in whatever voicing you have chosen in the score writing program,<br/>by ticking &quot;Select voice chann. by input chann,..&quot; from the Midi In Options window - a bit of a confusing<br/>name for that tick box, as what it really means, in its effect, is that FTS uses the patches<br/>from the Midi In rather than the ones you have selected in the Channels... window, (and<br/>changes voices selected into chann. if nec.)</p><p>For 12 t tunings one would choose the appropriate 12 t scale as the scale, and the diatonic mode as<br/>the arpeggio.</p><p>You also need to make sure you have Midi In set up to play<br/>from white notes (black notes being accidentals for the mode selected)<br/>For this, see In | Options | Play notes from</p><p>If you want to hear the music in pitch, not transposed, then set the first note of the scale to<br/>middle c from the Pitch... window.</p><p>But there is nothing to stop one using the same method, e.g. to compose in a gamelan tuning,</p><p>Choose the slendro scale, and follow scale, and successive lines / spaces of the score in the score<br/>writing program will then correspond to successive notes of the Slendro scale.</p><p>The middle C will correspond to 1st note of scale.</p><p>It&apos;s great!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
