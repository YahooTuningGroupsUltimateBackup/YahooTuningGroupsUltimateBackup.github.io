It is<br/>no longer published by Da Capo press NOR by the original publishers,<br/>Michigan State University.  Probably many of you know all of this...</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like Tantalus -- since the only copy is in the &quot;research&quot;<br/>section and cannot be taken out of the library.  It is also not always<br/>there...</p><p>Does anyone have an extra copy of this book??  Could I purchase it?  I<br/>suppose if I could even BORROW one that someone is not using I could take<br/>it to the xerox place.</p><p>Why do books like this go out of print??

I found one by putting in a &quot;book wanted&quot;<br/> request to <a href="http://abebooks.com">abebooks.com</a>.  They bring together booksellers and buyers, and<br/>individual people can list books wanted for free.  And you can search.  It<br/>took me about 3 months to find a copy, last summer.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
