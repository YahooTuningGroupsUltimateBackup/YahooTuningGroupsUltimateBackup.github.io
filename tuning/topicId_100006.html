I appreciate your feedback.  I take init. &gt; responses as  MAYBE     guts of my scheme<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve rushed to &quot;get down on paper&quot; the heart of a systematic scheme &gt; for ordering and classifying a set of building blocks composers of a &gt; post 12 equal temperament music can use which I believe has the &gt; power to &quot;electrify their workshops&quot; and enable them to break &gt; through a kind of &quot;glass ceiling veil&quot; which has lain draped unseen &gt; over the 20th century era music so familiar to us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d hoped - and do hope - to do a much better explained and complete &gt; job than this,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;I&apos;ll start by posting to Tuning - verbally only for now - the few &gt; core ideas underlying my scheme for classifying the body of &gt; &quot;comoponents&quot; or &quot;molecules&quot; which form the basic palette of &gt; uniquely distinct harmonies available to composers out of which to &gt; construct their musical creations.  I&apos;m leaving out music&apos;s other &gt; key elements - rhythm and timing, amplitudes over the music&apos;s flow, &gt; stereo balance, emotional meanings touched on over the course of the &gt; music, ... and so many other things.  Also I&apos;m not looking at &gt; melodic contour on it&apos;s own, but concentrating on the harmonies &gt; sounded in succession as the music proceeds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;In my particular scheme, I take what I call CHORD TRANSITIONS as &gt; the basic building blocks the composer uses in constructing his &gt; composition.  Generally music&apos;s basic harmonic elements tend to be &gt; thought to be the chords sounded as the music proceeds ..... eg  &quot; &gt; major triad on C    harmonic seventh chord on F    major triad on &gt; C     minor triad on A      harmonic seventh chord on F     major &gt; triad on C &quot; could be analyzed into a stream of six chords the &gt; composer had used there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;That&apos;s how I used to think, but at some point it started to dawn on &gt; me that it is really pairs of chords, one sounded after the other &gt; with a first chord &quot;leading into&quot; a second destination chord which &gt; are needed to say something which can stand on its own musically.  A &gt; single chord sounded by itself with no other harmony, not even any &gt; implied partner harmony, tends to leave one hanging in suspense.  &gt; &quot;Is it supposed to be part of music being played?  Or is it the &gt; doorbell.  or......&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;A major triad on G followed by a major triad on C is a pair of &gt; chords having a degree of completeness.  Probably an authentic &gt; cadence occurring in a piece of music in the key of C - at least &gt; with no other information that&apos;s what that pair of chords suggests.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;In short, I take pairs of chords having direction (C major triad &gt; followed by G major triad is not the same as G major triad first, &gt; followed by C major triad)    ...... but C major triad followed by G &gt; major triad IS the same as F major triad followed by C major &gt; excepting for the fact that the latter CHORD TRANSITION sounds at a &gt; pitch level a fourth higher than the former  ..... or at a pitch &gt; level a fifth lower than the former.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;In my proposed scheme, there can be any of 12 chord root shift &gt; intervals - 1 up a fifth (eg C to G)   2 down a fifth   3 up a major &gt; second (C to D)   4 down a major second (C to B-flat)   5 down a &gt; just minor third (C to A)   6 up a just minor third (C to E-flat)   &gt; 7 up a major third (second chord&apos;s root frequency 5/4 - just - times &gt; the first chord&apos;s root frequency)   8 down a just major third (eg C &gt; to A-flat)   9 down a 15/16 diatonic semitone (C to B)   10 up a &gt; 15/16 diatonic semitone (C to C-sharp)   11 up an augmented fourth &gt; (C to F-sharp)   *** very close to down an augmented fourth   12   &gt; first and 2nd chords are on the same root i.e. root shift is zero.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Then (first cut) I take it that the first chord can be any one of &gt; five &quot;types&quot; of chord and 2nd chord can be any one of these five &gt; &quot;types&quot; of chord as I&apos;ll explain.  This makes the number of possible &gt; combinations - 12 possible root shifts, 5 possible types for the &gt; first chord, 5 possible types for the second or destination chord &gt; (12 times 5 times 5 equals 300).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;For &quot;chord type&quot; I&apos;m taking it roughly that a chord can be:  1 a &gt; major triad, the highest small whole integer to which one of its &gt; note frequencies is proportional being 5   2 a harmonic seventh &gt; chord, the highest small whole integer to which one of its note &gt; frequencies is proportional being 7, its other notes having &gt; frequencies proportional to 5, 3, and 1 (root note) - or a related &gt; inversion perhaps having only two other notes with frequencies &gt; proportional to 5 and 3 - or 5 and 1 - or 3 and 1 **** note - these &gt; inversions aren&apos;t totally identical or equivalent, but they seem to &gt; belong to a &quot;close family&quot; of harmonically similar chords *****  &gt; Then beyond the harmonic 7th chord we have the harmonic 9th chord &gt; with one of its notes having a frequency proportional to 9 (other &gt; notes having note frequencies proportional to odd integers less than &gt; 9).  I&apos;m cutting the odd integers off at 11 and a six note chord &gt; with note frequencies proportional to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 is &gt; certainly a striking and unique animal.  Added to these four &quot;chord &gt; types&quot; are the minor chords with note frequencies proportional to 3, &gt; 5, and 15 as well as the root having frequency proportional to 1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;This scheme seems arbitrary as laid out in sketch form here, but a &gt; lot of ear testing and experimentation with chord construction on &gt; overtones and undertones etc., etc., etc. lies behind it.  I don&apos;t &gt; propose it as a final product, but as something which does embrace a &gt; large swath of the most important &quot;molecular elements&quot; in musical &gt; harmony.  These elements in the palette of musical harmonies have &gt; their own unique psychological perceptual effects and merit a place &gt; in the post 12 equal temperament/common practice composer&apos;s tool &gt; kit.  Very sweet harmonious music can be composed out of these &gt; elements or intriging mysterious sounding music can be built from &gt; them.  They put a great deal more power and flexibility and &gt; capability for creating striking, rarely heard novel effects into &gt; composers&apos; hands.  By contrast, the harmonic materials 12 equal &gt; temperament puts into a composer&apos;s hands have a slight bland &gt; &quot;sameness&quot; which seems to hang over music composed and/or performed &gt; in that system.  Quarter comma mean tone gives the composer more &gt; power and if extended beyond 12 notes per octave to 14, 15, ..... 24 &gt; notes per octave laid out in a spiral of fifths flattened by 1/4 &gt; comma (approximating 31 equal temperament) provides a powerful &gt; harmonic toolkit intermediate between the 12 equal tool kit and the &gt; one based on chord transitions with 12 possible root shifts and &gt; chords having note frequencies, the highest integer to which its &gt; note frequency is proportional being 5, 7, 9, 11, or 15.  Two such &gt; chords separated by one of the 12 possible root shifts form a unique &gt; &quot;molecule&quot; in this most advanced system I&apos;m proposing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;To repeat a key idea characterizing this palette of harmonies, I &gt; take not the single chord, but rather a chord TRANSITION having &gt; directionally ordered origin and destination chords whose roots are &gt; separated by one of 12 possible integer ratio intervals as the &gt; fundamental element or &quot;molecule&quot; out of which a musical composition &gt; (in its harmonic aspect) is constructed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;My initial first cut system offers about 300 unique building block &gt; elements out of which a composition may be said to be constructed.  &gt; Of course there&apos;s much more to music, but this system is to bear its &gt; harmonic aspects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Begin forwarded message:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; From: Ralph Hill &lt;ascend11@...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Date: June 11, 2011 10:25:05 PM PDT<br/>&gt;&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jonathan Glasier &lt;jonathan.sonicarts@...&gt;&gt; &gt;, Brink Mcgoogy &lt;mahagoogy@...&gt;, Elizabeth Glasier &lt;glasier2@...&gt;&gt; &gt;, Joe Monzo &lt;monzojoe@...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Subject: Fwd: ...general post to Tuning:...

Starting from a utonal tetrad, all the dyad sharing tetrads are otonal, and all the roots of the otonal tetrads are in an A3 lattice. The hexany is a deep hole of the A3 lattice, with the property that all the otonal tetrads based on it as roots share a dyad with a particular utonal tetrad, so the centers of the holes are in an A3 lattice arrangement.

I&apos;m leaving out music&apos;s other<br/>&gt; &gt; key elements - rhythm and timing, amplitudes over the music&apos;s flow,<br/>&gt; &gt; stereo balance, emotional meanings touched on over the course of the<br/>&gt; &gt; music, ... and so many other things.  Also I&apos;m not looking at<br/>&gt; &gt; melodic contour on it&apos;s own, but concentrating on the harmonies<br/>&gt; &gt; sounded in succession as the music proceeds.</p><p>What about melody? While I&apos;m sure good music can be &quot;constructed&quot; out<br/>of chord progressions it&apos;s the melody that most listeners hear as the<br/>musical foreground. So it seems to me that it would serve the composer<br/>well to think more in terms of melody. Counterpoint and harmony are<br/>complementary ways to look at the same thing but I think there is an<br/>unfortunate overemphasis on harmony in contemporary (tonal) music<br/>theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;In my particular scheme, I take what I call CHORD TRANSITIONS as<br/>&gt; &gt; the basic building blocks the composer uses in constructing his<br/>&gt; &gt; composition.  Generally music&apos;s basic harmonic elements tend to be<br/>&gt; &gt; thought to be the chords sounded as the music proceeds ..... eg  &quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; major triad on C    harmonic seventh chord on F    major triad on<br/>&gt; &gt; C     minor triad on A      harmonic seventh chord on F     major<br/>&gt; &gt; triad on C &quot; could be analyzed into a stream of six chords the<br/>&gt; &gt; composer had used there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &#x9;That&apos;s how I used to think, but at some point it started to dawn on<br/>&gt; &gt; me that it is really pairs of chords, one sounded after the other<br/>&gt; &gt; with a first chord &quot;leading into&quot; a second destination chord which<br/>&gt; &gt; are needed to say something which can stand on its own musically.  A<br/>&gt; &gt; single chord sounded by itself with no other harmony, not even any<br/>&gt; &gt; implied partner harmony, tends to leave one hanging in suspense.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Is it supposed to be part of music being played?  Or is it the<br/>&gt; &gt; doorbell.  or......&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &#x9;A major triad on G followed by a major triad on C is a pair of<br/>&gt; &gt; chords having a degree of completeness.  Probably an authentic<br/>&gt; &gt; cadence occurring in a piece of music in the key of C - at least<br/>&gt; &gt; with no other information that&apos;s what that pair of chords suggests.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &#x9;In short, I take pairs of chords having direction (C major triad<br/>&gt; &gt; followed by G major triad is not the same as G major triad first,<br/>&gt; &gt; followed by C major triad)    ...... but C major triad followed by G<br/>&gt; &gt; major triad IS the same as F major triad followed by C major<br/>&gt; &gt; excepting for the fact that the latter CHORD TRANSITION sounds at a<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch level a fourth higher than the former  ..... or at a pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; level a fifth lower than the former.</p><p>They definitely are NOT the same if you take the context of key into<br/>account. Those progressions can sound very different depending on what<br/>you hear as the tonic chord.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div>
