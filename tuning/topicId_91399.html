Your<br/>&gt; writing is clear, concise, and (dare I say) elegant, and this paper &gt; is just what<br/>&gt; I needed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What fascinates me a great deal is the fact that the &quot;nobly &gt; intoned&quot; mediants<br/>&gt; are essentially local maxima of harmonic entropy. Also, the fact &gt; that there is<br/>&gt; no noble mediant in the major second range is quite telling &gt; of...something. I<br/>&gt; feel as if I&apos;m on the brink of revelation regarding harmony and &gt; musical<br/>&gt; perception, but I can&apos;t quite get over the last barrier to &gt; &quot;enlightenment&quot;.<br/>&gt; There is something going on with the number phi, both in harmony &gt; and melody. I<br/>&gt; look at Wilson&apos;s &quot;scale tree&quot; and notice that something special is &gt; happening<br/>&gt; when, in an MOS scale, L:s = phi...but I can&apos;t put my finger on &gt; what it is.<br/>&gt; Some great pattern is staring me in the face, if I could but bring &gt; my focus to<br/>&gt; it. More meditation is in order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you, though, for giving me another piece of the puzzle!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91534 href="#91534">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2010 8:36:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Jacques and Igliashon,</p><p>Please forgive me for my delay in addressing this post!  I have<br/>been preparing the notes for my first tuning in the Ethno Extras<br/>series, which have proved much longer than I might have guessed.<br/>But your comments on the noble mediant, and some possible<br/>alternatives, are most interesting, and indeed I would not be<br/>surprised were there a variety of possible mathematical models<br/>for finding or approximating these points of &quot;maximum<br/>complexity.&quot;</p><p>[Jacques]</p><p>&gt;  The concept of Noble mediant is indeed giving interesting<br/>&gt;  results as a alternative mediant between two intervals in<br/>&gt;  numerous cases.</p><p>&gt;  More generally, it means certain more or less close intervals<br/>&gt;  can be found to belong to precise series, and as such they<br/>&gt;  will point to an infinity of other JI ratios, that will<br/>&gt;  converge toward a &quot;Noble mediant&quot; value.</p><p>This was indeed the thing that I excitedly realized when Dave<br/>Keenan explained to me his &quot;Noble mediant&quot; concept in September<br/>of 2000. While your following example with Phi itself is indeed a<br/>classic illustration, some of our focus was on the &quot;plateau&quot; or<br/>regoin of complexity between 5/4 and 9/7. I was excited to see<br/>how by taking a series of mediants, or by directly taking a<br/>mediant between these two simpler ratios using different<br/>weightings, I could generate a great variety of just ratios.</p><p>&gt;  In a trivial example of 8/5 and 13/8, Dave Keenan&apos;s formula :<br/>&gt;  (8 + 13Phi) / (5 + 8Phi) gives a very precise approximation of<br/>&gt;  Phi itself, (sqrt of 5 +1) / 2.</p><p>&gt;  It indicates that we consider 13/8 to be more advanced in the<br/>&gt;  series and as such has to be given Phi times more credibility,<br/>&gt;  and the same law can be found in any Phi series : that may<br/>&gt;  apply then to lots of intervals, and this formula can be<br/>&gt;  applied indeed to any intervals.</p><p>When Dave recognized this relationship, prompted in part by<br/>Keenan Pepper&apos;s proposal for his regular temperament based on a<br/>logarithmic ratio of Phi between the sizes (e.g. in cents) of the<br/>larger apotome and the smaller diatonic semitone or limma, a kind<br/>of counterpart of Kornerup&apos;s famous Golden Meantone, we indeed<br/>fuund that it seemed to fit many situations.</p><p>And Igliashon, your remark about Erv Wilson&apos;s scales at<br/>logarithmic points of Phi reminds me that Keenan Pepper&apos;s<br/>temperament, which was the catalyst to Dave&apos;s recognition of the<br/>&quot;Noble mediant,&quot; does appear as a Wilson horagram. Also, as if to<br/>connect these two themes, the Wilson/Pepper temperament has an<br/>augmented fifth from eight fifths up (e.g. C-G#) at 832.765<br/>cents, very close to Phi itself at 833.090 cents. It&apos;s a happy<br/>coincidence that in this particular &quot;L:s = Phi&quot; scale, Phi is<br/>also closely approximated as an interval ratio: two distinct<br/>things, of course, as Dave would often emphasize.</p><p> &gt;  However if we consider other intervals, belonging to other<br/> &gt;  noble numbers series, such as 6/5 and 29/24<br/> &gt; It is not certain that Phi will be the most adequate and<br/> &gt; natural noble mediant, while<br/> &gt; 12 + 29*2.414 / 5 + 12*2.414 ~ sqrt of 2 + 1 suggests another<br/> &gt; and more significative noble mediant.</p><p>While I cannot speak for Dave, it seems intuitively likely to me<br/>that various noble mediants or the like might best apply in<br/>different situations. And I suspect that your experience with<br/>differentially coherent JI might make you especially alert to the<br/>fine points of these different possible models.</p><p>&gt;  And the following Aksaka converging series :<br/>&gt;  5 12 29 70 169... where 12/5, 29/12, 35/24, 169/70, etc...<br/>&gt;  converge towards (sqrt 2) + 1,<br/>&gt;  could seem more pertinent and attractive, when Phi is replaced<br/>&gt;  locally by (sqrt 2) + 1, in Dave&apos;s very same formula.  = many<br/>&gt;  noble mediants...</p><p>One very small point: here, looking at the series, I suspect that<br/>your &quot;35/24&quot; was meant to be &quot;35/29,&quot; the octave reduction of<br/>29:70, at 325.562 cents.</p><p>Such series might indeed be an opportunity to discover<br/>alternative noble mediants, maybe sooner or later a good topic<br/>for another paper, in which I would warmly encourage you.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
