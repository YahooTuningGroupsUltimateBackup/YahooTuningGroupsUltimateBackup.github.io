If we find that the original text in fact specified &quot;the third<br/>of the # of F,&quot; then the plain Italian words must take precedence over<br/>such general assumptions.</p><p>In interpreting such a critical text, I will happily defer to fluent<br/>speakers of the Italian language familiar with the musical parlance of<br/>the time. If a clear interpretation of the Lucca contract is possible,<br/>then we may happily exchange a doubt for a certainly, to borrow a<br/>phrase from the Spanish author Lope de Vega Carpio.</p><p>In the absence of such a firm reading, two factors might cause me to<br/>lean toward Ab rather than A# in the epoch around 1480, especially<br/>assuming some kind of meantone temperament (as does Lindley):</p><p>          (1) The discussions of the Ab/G# question as the main<br/>              issue regarding the choice of accidentals or split<br/>              key tunings by Ramos (1482) and Schlick (1511); and</p><p>          (2) The possibly more likely use of Ab rather than A#<br/>              both in written compositions of this era (the<br/>              epoch of the later Ockeghem, Josquin, and Isaac)<br/>              and in transpositions by keyboard players.</p><p>On the first point, Ramos in 1482 describes what Mark Lindley<br/>persuasively argues is a meantone keyboard, advocating Ab-C# as a more<br/>&quot;provident&quot; 12-note tuning than Eb-G#, and discussing the Ab/G#<br/>question at some length. At one place he also touches indirectly, on<br/>the question of a D# key; Lindley interprets another passage about<br/>sonorities in Phyrgian as involving Eb/D#, although I read it as more<br/>likely presenting another side of the Ab/G# question.</p><p>For a discussion of Ramos, please see, for example, my article at</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html</a></p><p>Schlick in 1511, like Ramos, prefers Ab to G#, and proposes what might<br/>be termed a &quot;semi-well-temperament&quot; for a 12-note instrument in which<br/>this accidental is tuned so as to be a serviceable Ab or a marginally<br/>playable G# in rapid cadential passages. Like Ramos, he considers Ab<br/>as the more important note to include.</p><p>However, I am not aware of any mention of A# in this era, although it<br/>is included in the 17-note Pythagorean schemes of Prosdocimus (1413)<br/>and Ugolino (c. 1435), and an F-A# tuning may have been in use, as<br/>Mark Lindley suggests, for the repertory of Breslau (c. 1430).</p><p>Moving from theory to practice, I am not aware of the use of A# in any<br/>written composition of the era around 1480-1520, with the possible<br/>exception of something like Willaert&apos;s chromatic quartet (first known<br/>to 20th-century musicologists as a duo) which seems designed more as a<br/>kind of &quot;puzzle piece&quot; for singers than for playing on a keyboard.</p><p>In contrast, Schlick himself uses Ab, and it might easily occur in<br/>certain relatively frequent transpositions.</p><p>For example, in music around this period and somewhat earlier<br/>(e.g. the Old Hall Manuscript of c. 1370-1410 in England), one may<br/>find lower voices with a signature of two flats, Eb and Bb. Scholars<br/>such as Margaret Bent and Andrew Hughes have suggested that in such a<br/>transposition of the gamut, the usual fluid step B-fa/B-mi (or better,<br/>in the German mode of notation, B-fa/H-mi) becomes A-fa/A-mi, that is,<br/>A/Ab.</p><p>Such a situation would also result if the Dorian mode on D were<br/>transposed down a whole-tone to C, as Zarlino (1558) suggests may have<br/>been not uncommon, with Bb and Eb as natural degrees of the mode.<br/>Again, the usual fluid degree of D Dorian, B/Bb or H/B, becomes A/Ab,<br/>with a split key at Ab/G# (or G#/Ab) facilitating this transposition.</p><p>For example, in a usual composition in D Dorian (the First Mode), we<br/>might have a cadence such as the following (here I use an octave<br/>numbering system with C4 as middle C):</p><p>D5      C#5 D5<br/>G4   A4     A4<br/>D4   E4     D3<br/>Bb3  A3     D3</p><p>Musically, this type of cadence might be interpreted as a kind of<br/>chain of two cadential progressions, both involving the expansion of a<br/>major sixth to an octave. In the first, the sixth Bb3-G4 resolves to<br/>the octave A3-A4 -- and the major third Bb3-D4 to the fifth A3-E4 --<br/>thus leading into a suspension of the higest voice at a minor seventh<br/>above the tenor or next-to-lowest voice (E4-D5) and at the eleventh<br/>above the bass (A3-D5). These suspensions then resolve (7-6, 11-10)<br/>followed by a concluding progression between the tenor and highest<br/>voice from major sixth to octave.</p><p>The first M6-8 resolution involves descending semitonal motion, and<br/>the second ascending semitonal motion -- respectively _remissa_ and<br/>_sostenido_ (one might say in English &quot;flat&quot; and &quot;sharp&quot;), as Tomas de<br/>Santa Maria (1565) will describe and contrast these two varieties of<br/>cadences.</p><p>If we transpose Dorian down by a whole-step or a major second, with<br/>the final now on C rather than D, we get this progression, using the<br/>German &quot;H&quot; to indicate the cadential B-natural in the highest voice:</p><p>C5      H4  C5<br/>F4   G4     G4<br/>C4   D4     C4<br/>Ab3  G3     C3</p><p>This kind of extemporized transposition, as well as the use of written<br/>Ab in some pieces of the time, makes Ab an obviously useful accidental<br/>in an epoch when the tendency may have been to experiment more in the<br/>flatward than the sharpward direction.</p><p>By around 1550, the situation was changing: Orlando di Lasso uses A#<br/>as well as D# and Ab in his _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_, with the<br/>Prologue, for example, exactly fitting an Eb-A# tuning like that your<br/>proposed reading would indicate for Lucca.</p><p>As Ibo Ortgies has noted, a later organ at Lucca, Accademia di Tomaso<br/>Raffaelli, dated to &quot;before 1609&quot; does feature Bb/A# as well as G#/Ab<br/>-- and also Eb/D# for at least part of the instrument&apos;s range. In view<br/>of the use of A# in music of the later 16th and early 17th centuries,<br/>this choice _might_ be more likely around 1580 or 1600 than around<br/>1480; but then, again, there might also be a local tradition here.</p><p>My initial reaction that Lindley&apos;s reading of _tersa del fa delle f_<br/>to mean a &quot;flat third&quot; above F (Ab), seemed attractive, should not<br/>take precedence over a sound reading of the Italian text -- and<br/>possibly the emendation of that text. In 1606, Cima refers to a sharp<br/>note as a _diesis_, a medieval and early modern term for a usual<br/>diatonic semitone as well as the special smaller interval of<br/>Marchettus of Padua (1318) or Vicentino (1555).</p><p>Another line of inquiry, _absent a clear reading of the Lucca contract<br/>text_, might investigate how common a split-key arrangement with Bb/A#<br/>but without Ab/G# (or G#/Ab) might have been in the era of 1480-1540<br/>or so, before the accidentalism of composers such as Rore and the<br/>young Lasso may have made extreme sharps more common.</p><p>However, what I am describing is an exercise in the art of guessing,<br/>and a more confident reading of the text might not only make such<br/>guesses unnecessary but revise my estimate of probabilities for other<br/>instruments of this epoch.</p><p>In the exact sciences, as the experience of Lise Meitner and her<br/>colleagues in the discover of nuclear fission may suggest, a too-ready<br/>willingness to dismiss anomalies or discount puzzling results may<br/>delay the recognition of a more fruitful theory.</p><p>The question of split-key instruments may be similar, and your focus<br/>on the question of how best to read an Italian text -- regardless of<br/>preconceptions about &quot;likely&quot; choices in 1480 -- seems of critical<br/>importance in resolving or at least clarifying this question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
