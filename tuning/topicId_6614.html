This is simply a<br/>verifiable (and quantifiable) observation...</p><p>It doesn&apos;t take a PhD in lingusitics to appreciate that language (as does<br/>music!) evolves from usage.</p><p>Therefore, I would suggest that if this is of such an issue to the<br/>alternate tuning cognocenti, that knowledgeable individuals simply start<br/>using the words correctly -- microtones, when they apply, and &quot;macrotones&quot;<br/>when they apply... (or whatever one feel is appropriate and descriptive).<br/>Naturally, the whole field could be called &quot;alternate tunings.&quot;</p><p>Therefore, instead of the &quot;American Festival of Microtonal Music,&quot; we would<br/>have the &quot;American Association of Alternate Tunings,&quot; or AAAT.</p><p>Nice little phrases could result...  &quot;Where it&apos;s AT is AAAT!&quot;  (perhaps<br/>even things more sophisticated).</p><p>(This title also works very well for the phone book!)</p><p>Unfortunately, for such organizations as the AFMM, it is far too late to<br/>changes things...  This pertains to most usage questions.  In fact, like<br/>most general words, once people are accustomed to them and know what they<br/>mean, do they really care anymore what they mean technically??  Probably<br/>not...</p></div>
