And you<br/>can&apos;t call it &apos;cheating&apos; to suggest that Bach&apos;s tuning probably<br/>changed over the years between 1722 and 1744.</p><p>Like Brad, Mark Lindley believes that temperament is one element of a<br/>convincing performance - which interacts with other elements in that<br/>(for example) the sound of tempered chords will influence how a<br/>performer plays them, in conjunction with other features of the music.<br/>I experienced this at first hand, at a lecture-demonstration last year.</p><p>Lindley noted that, in his opinion, and independently of any choice of<br/>tuning, the E major and Ab major preludes in &apos;Book 1&apos; have contrasting<br/>characters and types of articulation. The E major piece is pastoral,<br/>relaxed, with many sustained and tied-over notes, and an essentially<br/>legato line. Ab major is brisk and vigorous, with many isolated chords<br/>punctuated by rests, or two-part passage-work in 16th- and 8th-notes,<br/>which should probably be performed with mainly detached articulation.</p><p>Lindley believes that a tuning in which Ab-C is sharper than E-G#<br/>(though not so sharp as 81/64!) would contribute positively to the<br/>expression of these characters. For instance a relatively<br/>rapidly-beating third Ab-c inside the first chord of the Ab Prelude<br/>might encourage a performer to release this chord a little earlier<br/>than its notated value - which Lindley believes would be musically<br/>beneficial. Contrariwise, the E-G# third at the beginning of the E<br/>Prelude would beat relatively slowly and encourage the performer to<br/>hold the notes down as notated, creating a gentler and more legato<br/>character. (Similar remarks apply to arpeggios in the C major, F#<br/>major Preludes.)</p><p>And in general, he thinks that the different characters of these two<br/>keys in his type of tuning suit the different characters of the<br/>preludes - but not so much in Lehman&apos;s, where the sizes of the thirds<br/>are the other way round.</p><p>Lindley does not under any circumstances accept that the chord of Ab<br/>major, as he would have it in WTC book I, contains &apos;tuning flaws&apos;. In<br/>his opinion, a performance with his type of tuning and with detached<br/>articulation would be musically optimal. To say that the detached<br/>articulation is intended to &apos;hide&apos; the tuning of the chord is a gross<br/>misrepresentation. On the contrary, the articulation and the tuning,<br/>experienced together, create the artistic impression.</p><p>You might as well say that Bach &apos;cheated&apos; by &apos;hiding&apos; the note C in<br/>the middle of a chord!!</p><p>Other people may of course prefer different types of tuning, where<br/>different chords have thirds that are as sharp (or sharper!) than<br/>Lindley&apos;s proposed Ab-C; they may also prefer different playing<br/>styles. This does not justify Brad, or anyone else, saying that<br/>Lindley&apos;s views constitute &apos;cheating&apos;.</p><p>As for the &apos;Book II&apos; Ab prelude, Lindley had not explicitly discussed<br/>it.

And if<br/>characteristics of the piece trump tuning considerations,(e.g. WTC1 E<br/>major prelude is &apos;pastoral&apos;) exactly how important *are* the tuning<br/>characteristics, or, in other words, what will they contribute to<br/>playing decisions precisely? Do they *really* contribute, all else<br/>being equal? Sure we can agree they color a mood, but in your<br/>experience, what characterisitc of E major in your tuning would<br/>makeBach ant that particular piece in E major instead of a more<br/>traditional pastoral F major for example?</p><p>It would be nice to get a precise statement of your claims of the<br/>mapping of tuning to performance....thanks!</p><p>-A.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Re: the message below, by Tom Dent:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently I have made a poor choice of words, in my remark at the<br/>&gt; quoted paragraph.
