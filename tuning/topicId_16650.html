It can be no other<br/>way.&quot;</p><p>Seems like everyone read through the omission as though it were there<br/>though, and my point came across as intended?</p><p>I once did a workshop with John Abercrombie and Ralph Towner, and I<br/>remember Towner talking about his improvisational approach and how it<br/>hinged on &quot;setting things in motion&quot;, and that once certain things<br/>were set into motion you could drop them altogether and in a very real<br/>sense they would still be there... Funny, but this kind of works with<br/>email too. I often find myself reading right through others mistakes<br/>as though they&apos;re not even there so long as the meat of the matter has<br/>already been set in motion.</p><p>I think things are getting better as far as more microtonal guitars<br/>are popping up with more frequency. But I think it&apos;s really going to<br/>take a &quot;sound&quot; to get a lot of people saying, &quot;damn, check that<br/>out...&quot; I think someone like Tom Morello would be PERFECT for<br/>fretless... the guys in Korn for quarter-tone guitars, Metheny for JI<br/>or some other more colorful &apos;tonal&apos; tuning, etc., etc.</p><p>If it were just about something looking cool, then I think Catler&apos;s<br/>G&amp;L just guitar would already rule the world &lt;g&gt;... But I think it&apos;s<br/>gonna take a highly visible person with a striking sound who also<br/>preaches some strain of the xenharmonic gospel with a bit of gusto.</p><p>Via, McLaughlin, Fiuczynski, none of these guys have had anything<br/>close to that combination all synced up and out there. It simply<br/>hasn&apos;t happened yet. But it will! &lt;&quot;any day now&quot;, &quot;any day&quot;...&gt;</p><p>In the past I&apos;ve kind of felt like I didn&apos;t really give a rat&apos;s hat if<br/>no one &quot;big&quot; pushed &quot;the cause&quot;, &apos;cause I kind of like quite places to<br/>call my own... so the hell with &apos;em all! But in-between my craggy<br/>muttering I can&apos;t help but think that it&apos;s going to happen anyway, so<br/>let it begin I say...</p><p>12-tET&apos;s plenty cool enough, but the ol&apos; monopolist has seriously over<br/>saturated its resources and it&apos;s only a matter of time and<br/>circumstance before the its omnipresent stranglehold begins to loosen.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=16659 href="#16659">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2000 7:37:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16650">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16650</a></p><p>&gt; 12-tET&apos;s plenty cool enough, but the ol&apos; monopolist has seriously<br/>over saturated its resources and it&apos;s only a matter of time and<br/>&gt; circumstance before the its omnipresent stranglehold begins to<br/>loosen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>Yes, and Dan, it seems at this point that it is pretty difficult to<br/>write original &quot;serioso&quot; concert art music in 12-tET that is not:</p><p>1) Minimalism</p><p>2) Prokofievian rewrites of history</p><p>3) Serialism (still) or &quot;derivative&quot; pieces in a more extended<br/>&quot;theatrical&quot; version of this genre</p><p>4) Theatre pieces</p><p>Why, of course, as has been discussed on this list, there is the<br/>occasional original who fights all the odds and comes up with an<br/>original voice in 12-tET these days... but the language is pretty<br/>much exhausted... it has been hammered with minimalism,<br/>chromaticized, rotated, set-theoried and turned upside down and<br/>backwards,re-written by tonalist neo-romantics (yecch!) under the<br/>guise of the old &quot;New Romanticism&quot; that was written better by many<br/>composers years ago...</p><p>No, it&apos;s time for &quot;fresh air&quot; and it&apos;s going to happen.
