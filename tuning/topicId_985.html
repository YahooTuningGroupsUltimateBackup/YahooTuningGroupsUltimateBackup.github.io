Are ratios usually catagorized by prime limit or odd<br/>limit? Ratios with 9 in them are, I thought, 3 limit ratios. I was looking<br/>at Joe Monzo&apos;s page and he speaks of prime limits and then treats 9 as a<br/>limit also. Also, if you&apos;re going to draw a 5-limit lattice why would it<br/>only contain six ratios, and not have, say 15/8? Would 15/8 only appear in<br/>a 15-limit lattice?</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t 3 limit ratios include 9/8 and 16/9, as well as anything else<br/>containing no prime factor greater than 3? Since there are an infinite<br/>number of ratios of each prime limit, what other factor accounts for when<br/>to stop filling the octave with them? On my webpage I suggest an octave<br/>limit, where intevals of a given prime limit are included up to an<br/>arbitrary octave limit of the harmonic series. Are there other schemes?</p><p>thanks,</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=986 href="#986">ðŸ”—</a>bram &#x3C;bram@gawth.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/1999 10:46:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 24 Feb 1999, dante rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; Im a little confused.

Are ratios usually catagorized by prime limit or<br/>odd<br/>&gt;limit?</p><p>This is a great question. Partch, who introduced the term limit, usually<br/>meant odd limit, but was not entirely consistent. In most cases he would<br/>speak of ratios of 9 as belonging either to the 9-limit or as<br/>_secondary_ ratios of the 3-limit. Others after Partch started the prime<br/>limit usage.</p><p>Here is the definition of limit I wrote for the Southeast Just<br/>Intonation Center&apos;s Just Intonation Reference (compiled by Adam<br/>Silverman) and Joe Monzo&apos;s tuning dictionary<br/>(<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm</a>):</p><p>*1. prime limit: A pitch system in Just Intonation where all ratios are<br/>of integers containing no prime factors higher than n is said to be an<br/>&quot;n-limit&quot; system.</p><p>*2. odd limit: A chord in Just Intonation where all ratios are of<br/>integers containing no odd factors higher than n is said to be an<br/>&quot;n-limit&quot; chord. A composition or style where chords of the n-limit are<br/>considered consonant and chords of any higher limit are considered<br/>dissonant is said to be an &quot;n-limit&quot; composition or style. Note that<br/>this may not agree with the &quot;prime limit&quot; definition.</p><p>What I like about this definition is that it almost always fits what<br/>people are saying. If people are talking about a JI tuning system, with<br/>a potentially infinite number of notes, that system is usually<br/>characterized by a prime limit. If people (especially Partch) are<br/>talking about consonance and dissonance, the odd limit is usually more<br/>important.</p><p>&gt;Ratios with 9 in them are, I thought, 3 limit ratios.</p><p>9/7 is a 9-odd-limit and 7-prime-limit ratio.</p><p>&gt;Also, if you&apos;re going to draw a 5-limit lattice why would it<br/>&gt;only contain six ratios, and not have, say 15/8? Would 15/8 only appear<br/>in<br/>&gt;a 15-limit lattice?</p><p>No, lattices are infinite and a 5-limit lattice would have to contain a<br/>15/8, since definition 1 applies to JI pitch systems such as lattices.</p><p>What you&apos;re probably looking at is the lattice representation of<br/>Partch&apos;s 5-limit tonality diamond. This is, of course, a subset of the<br/>infinite lattice; namely, those pitches which form a 5-limit consonance<br/>with 1/1. Since we&apos;re talking about consonance, definition 2 applies,<br/>and 15/8 is not part of the 5-limit.</p><p>15/8 would appear in a 15-limit tonality diamond.</p><p>Many people think prime limit gives additional information about<br/>consonance after odd-limit is already considered. I disagree, and think<br/>that this is a result of confusion caused by looking at chords with more<br/>than two voices. For example, consider the following chords (from the<br/>definition of saturated in the tuning dictionary):</p><p>*the complete 9-limit Otonality *the complete 9-limit Utonality<br/>*12:15:18:20, and *14:18:21:24.</p><p>All of these chords are composed entirely of 9-odd-limit intervals, no<br/>higher. But the presence of 15 and 21 in the ratio representations of<br/>the chords on the right might confuse people into thinking that the<br/>odd-limit is 15 and 21, respectively. Since these chords are clearly<br/>more consonant than similar chords with 11 or 13 in them, one might be<br/>led to think that the prime limit is sometimes more important than the<br/>odd limit in determining consonance. But again, that is a result of not<br/>seeing what the odd limit really is.</p><p>To use your 15/8 example, Partch considered 15:8 a dissonance. Now many<br/>people may object that 8:10:12:15 (the major seventh chord) is more<br/>consonant than any chord with 11 or 13 in it. That may be true, but I<br/>would say that the consonance of the other 5 intervals in the major<br/>seventh chord (10:8=5:4, 12:8=3:2, 12:10=6:5, 15:10=3:2, 15:12=5:4) is<br/>so much greater than the consonance of any ratio of 11 or 13 that the<br/>dissonance of 15:8 is not as important by comparison. As an isolated<br/>interval, I certainly feel that 15:8 is more dissonant than 11:8 or<br/>13:8, if we could divorce ourselves from familiarity with diatonic<br/>intervals. But the context of the major seventh chord allows 15:8 to<br/>participate in many 5-limit consonances in a way that 11:8 or 13:8 could<br/>never do.</p><p>&gt;Wouldn&apos;t 3 limit ratios include 9/8 and 16/9, as well as anything else<br/>&gt;containing no prime factor greater than 3?</p><p>Again, this depends on the definition, which usually depends on context.</p><p>&gt;Since there are an infinite<br/>&gt;number of ratios of each prime limit, what other factor accounts for<br/>when<br/>&gt;to stop filling the octave with them?</p><p>One possibility: odd-limit. Then you don&apos;t even need the prime limit<br/>anymore, you still get a finite number of pitches per octave.</p><p>&gt;On my webpage I suggest an octave<br/>&gt;limit, where intevals of a given prime limit are included up to an<br/>&gt;arbitrary octave limit of the harmonic series. Are there other schemes?</p><p>1. How about octave limit without prime limit? This is equivalent to odd<br/>limits of 3, 7, 15, 31 (2^n-1), isn&apos;t it?</p><p>2. Instead of having a single tonal center, start constructing intervals<br/>from other important intervals, such as 3/2 and 4/3, etc. This is what<br/>Partch did to go from the 29-tone 11-limit tonality diamond (which is<br/>all pitches forming an 11-odd-limit ratio with 1/1) to a 43-tone scale<br/>which allows one to establish tonal centers (in the Partchian sense) on<br/>pitches other than 1/1. His 43-tone scale also approximates 41-tone<br/>equal temperament with two auxiliaries, allowing ideas to be transposed<br/>freely without changing too much (Partch once asked Erv Wilson to<br/>explain what was going on in a particular composition Partch was working<br/>on on the Chromelodeon, which didn&apos;t appear to make sense in terms of<br/>ratios. Wilson pointed out to Partch that Partch was in fact transposing<br/>as if it were 41-tET, without regard to the exact ratios produced).</p><p>E-mail me and we can go over all kinds of possibilities.</p><p>Bram wrote,</p><p>&gt;What I&apos;m confused about is why people don&apos;t<br/>&gt;more often talk about just plain integer limit - 10/7 being 10 limit<br/>and<br/>&gt;7/5 being 7 limit, that sort of thing.</p><p>If you want to get octave-specific, integer limit is important. But<br/>usually it is assumed that any pitch can be transposed to any octave and<br/>any chord can be played in any inversion, and one wants to characterize<br/>all these possibities at the same time. So one ignores even numbers.</p></div><h3><a id=1009 href="#1009">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/1999 6:52:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was not trying to patronize you dante your question was simple or at least it<br/>seemed simple so i gave a simple answer<br/>I was not listing primes to show my math but to list the ones frequently used in<br/>JI.<br/>Nine is composite Harry Partch or not Bub.<br/>Nine is not a &apos;prime&apos; limit just a limit or convenient place to stop.<br/>Your overthinking a simple thing maybe you are catching   tetitis<br/>and yes you are definitely missing something<br/>Pat</p><p>dante rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: dante rosati &lt;<a href="mailto:dante@pop.interport.net">dante@pop.interport.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From: Patrick Pagano &lt;<a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;its the way they are broken down guys<br/>&gt; &gt;2 times 5 is 10, 10 just being a duple of five.<br/>&gt; &gt;9 a composite of three<br/>&gt; &gt;i think the main limits are 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,31  at least as far as this list<br/>&gt; &gt;has mentioned so far<br/>&gt; &gt;Pat<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gee, thanks, Pat(ronizing), for educating us morons as to what a prime<br/>&gt; number is.

That then means that each odd number, being not<br/>reduceable by 2, outlines a new musical character.</p><p>   The concept underlying prime limits is that we can factor out stacks of any<br/>interval (i.e., powers of any number) just as we can any arbitrary number of<br/>octaves.  That being the case, powers of a given number become a minor<br/>consideration compared the number being there at all, which in turn means that<br/>the measuring stick has to be primes.  The concept then is that you can stack up<br/>as many 3s (for example) as you&apos;d like and the high-level character doesn&apos;t<br/>change much from just having one three.

By that I mean that *part* of the sense that 3s have a &quot;steely<br/>cold logical simplicity&quot; to them, is just simply because the first<br/>intervals they form are the P4 and P5, and that &quot;steely cold...&quot; character<br/>is more that of P4s and P5s than of 3s.  But there is certainly more to it<br/>than that, as evidenced by a comparison of 27:16 to 5:3 - 5:3 sounds to my<br/>ears to have a sweetness that 27:16 lacks.</p><p>   The second limiting factor for the concept of limits, in my view, is<br/>that once the numbers in a ratio get bigger than a few tens, it really<br/>starts to lose unique character pretty quickly.  2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, and<br/>7:6, for example have very clearly recognizable musical character.  But<br/>once you start talking about 81:64, 243:128, and such, the pitch<br/>relationship becomes complicated enough that it&apos;s much more difficult to<br/>attribute a clearly apparent musical character to in typical-speed music<br/>with harmony of typical density, on typical timbres.  So ratios involving<br/>any power of, say, 13 (other than 13 itself) are more prone to sound like a<br/>muddled, nondescript, out-of-tune version of a nearby simpler ratio, than<br/>any distinct in their own right.  That much less having distinct a 13ish<br/>character.</p><p>   Now I&apos;m not suggesting that the size of the numbers in a ratio is the<br/>*only* factor determining how audibly intuitive it is, but it&apos;s a sig-<br/>nificant factor, I&apos;ve found.</p></div>
