But I&apos;ve heard<br/>little computer music that did as much for me as the &quot;beep and boop&quot;<br/>music of the Columbia lab people, nor much &apos;sample&apos; based music<br/>that really improved upon the tape music it is technologically<br/>superior to.</p><p>micro-real news : I played with a Saz player on my NYC trip. He<br/>had 19 notes out of 24 and sounded great even though I only had<br/>12 out of 24... my 31eq guitar wasn&apos;t ready yet :-(... [sad<br/>and drooling emoticon?]... I rebuilt my fretless guitar and<br/>still am not enjoying it...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
