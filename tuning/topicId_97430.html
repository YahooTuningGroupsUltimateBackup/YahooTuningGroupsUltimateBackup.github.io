Like the (fret numbers starting on the<br/>low A in 12 equal) 5-4-5-6 Hendrix chord - it is there in 12, 17 and 18 -<br/>sounds different but the shape still works. This is with the caveat you tune<br/>the guitar to itself at the 5th and 4th fret like a 12 equal guitar.</p><p>And the answer to your question - nope - very little dressing needed but<br/>height is still reasonable. On an electric you should have even more room to<br/>play.</p><p>And since I want to discuss this with someone I&apos;m going to re-post this from<br/>MMM  ---------------------</p><p>A curious thought came to me a couple days ago. Why not reuse the 12 equal<br/>slots? Why are we eradicating 12 equal slots in *every* case?</p><p>This was before I saw this monster at Ron Sword&apos;s site.</p><p><a href="http://ninestring.org/index.php?topic=25.0">http://ninestring.org/index.php?topic=25.0</a></p><p>It is a guitar that combines 36 + 24 + 12 equal into regions. In my case I<br/>was looking at the extra 12 equal frets in my 18 equal refret and thinking -<br/>what would happen if I just popped in the additional frets? In theory you<br/>could play both 12 equal *and* 18 equal and some Frankensteinian combination<br/>of the two.</p><p>I&apos;m sure it can&apos;t work for every tuning... but for some (non-24 edo) it<br/>probably makes sense. And might be a really reasonable way to introduce<br/>microtonality to a  guitarist.</p><p>Also - I&apos;ve been finding I like tuning my 18 edo guitar to 12 equal but<br/>playing 18 equal frets. I have NO idea what the result should be called but<br/>it sounds nice to me.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Fri, Apr 1, 2011 at 2:38 PM, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...t&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; 4.
