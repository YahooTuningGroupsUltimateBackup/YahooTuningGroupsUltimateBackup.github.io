Perhaps these really are just one in the same?</p><p>This is an interesting analysis that makes Ives a kind of &quot;looking glass&quot;<br/>-- a person can see whatever he wants in it, including the person himself.<br/>This is almost verging on a kind of John Cagean approach.  There could be<br/>some truth to this... given the fact that Ives encompasses so many<br/>different things.  It just takes a &quot;spinmeister..&quot; and away we go...</p><p>HOWEVER, there IS some substantiation to various claims on Ives&apos;<br/>orientation, particularly with regard to intonation.  Soon, Johnny Reinhard<br/>will be releasing a bombshell (no, no, not what you think... I mean a<br/>PUBLICATION) which will illustrate the xenharmonic direction of the<br/>entirety of Ives work... or at least his theoretical thinking on the<br/>subject.</p><p>Frankly, I was rather &quot;blown away&quot; when I first read this material... since<br/>I never really understand why Johnny was so involved with Ives in the first<br/>place.  It didn&apos;t bother me; I&apos;ve always loved I&apos;ve(s).</p><p>HOWEVER, it seemed that a little &quot;overtone machine&quot; in the Universe<br/>Symphony did not necessarily justify the inclusion of the Universe Symphony<br/>on a series of xenharmonic music....</p><p>BUT, I&apos;m convinced now that Ives really wanted the majority of his work to<br/>be in some kind of &quot;alternate tuning&quot; but felt it was too unconventional,<br/>even for him, and when this book is released (soon) it should make some<br/>impact.  There will still need to be some convincing of Ives scholars like<br/>my friend (now newly famous) Jan Swafford...</p><p>______________   ________  _____  ___  __  _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
