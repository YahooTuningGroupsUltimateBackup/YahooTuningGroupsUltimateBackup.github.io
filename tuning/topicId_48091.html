I was fascinated then of sound his music had, and started to study his &bdquo;Unterweisung im Tonsatz&ldquo;, (Tuition in Setting Music)  to find out how he got to his specific contrapunctual style.<br/>There I found that he first had explored the musical matter in order to create a new &bdquo;temperament&ldquo;, based on derivation of harmonics and corresponding sub harmonics.<br/>But when he arrived to the seventh harmonic, he suddenly stopped to apply his method, stating that including this one would create a chaos, as we would have to take also the seventh harmonic of the seventh harmonic, and so on.<br/>So I thought, what happens if I just do that ?<br/>I thought, if I set the seventh harmonic into relation to the next upper octave, I&rsquo;ll get the ratio 8/7 (or equally 7/8), and from there the next step is 64/49 etc. Now this interval is even larger than the major second, so I divided it by 2.<br/>The natural wide second I called Septaton, and thus the Septatonic Scale came into being.<br/>I did a lot of calculation to establish the intervals and pitches, not knowing there is so beautiful microtonal software in the net.<br/>Soon after starting to use a computer, I finally found Manuel op de Couls &bdquo;Scala&ldquo; software, and Peter Frazers &bdquo;Midicode Synthesizer&ldquo;, to enable me to create music in that system.<br/>Yes, it is a really important point that interpretation of microtonal works by musicians is something far different from computer music, but by the aid of the machine, we can train our ears and get a first impression of the sounds.<br/>This is the actual stage where I find myself now...</p></div><h3><a id=48094 href="#48094">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2003 12:37:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Wernerlinden@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I thought, if I set the seventh harmonic into relation to the next<br/>upper octave, I&acirc;Â€Â™ll get the ratio 8/7 (or equally 7/8), and from<br/>there the next step is 64/49 etc. Now this interval is even larger<br/>than the major second, so I divided it by 2.<br/>&gt; The natural wide second I called Septaton, and thus the Septatonic<br/>Scale came into being.</p><p>Basing scales on sqrt(8/7) or thereabouts (called a &quot;secor&quot;) is very<br/>popular around here, and basing scales on 8/7 also makes sense.

The tunings lists,<br/>archives, and file upload areas would go in the separate tunings list<br/>domain.</p><p>What is the difference between these two options to you?</p><p>You are a key member of this community and your presence on the tunings list<br/>will help to promote your company.  I am all for promoting your company,<br/>expecially considering your generosity to this community.</p><p>I also see a potential political problem with the tunings list as an<br/>independent semi-academic community being affiliated with a particular<br/>company&apos;s domain.  It could conceivably be sort of like having audio DSP<br/>discussion groups hosted on the <a href="http://steinberg.de">steinberg.de</a> website.  Except no I would<br/>never be likely to compare Monz&apos;s company with steinberg, so this is an<br/>exhaggeration.</p><p>The advantage of using yahoogroups is that it is pretty much guaranteed to<br/>be a politcally neutral situation.  As I reflect on alternatives, besides<br/>issues of stability of hosting, no matter who else offered hosting, there<br/>would be biases of various kinds involved.  If I were to offer hosting, I<br/>would have to ask who would want me hosting anything?  How would they know<br/>how my biases might interfere with the good of the community?  What<br/>guarantee would they have?</p><p>So here is the thing:  I would hate to *ever* see the tunings list community<br/>fragment for political reasons.  I would want to insure against this<br/>somehow.  One way to achieve this is to have a separaate domain, for Monz to<br/>agree to host that domain, and to agree to let it go free if the need ever<br/>came up.  The details could be worked out for how to make this possible at<br/>the technical level.</p><p>I hope bringing this up doesn&apos;t create discomfort - well it has - I am<br/>uncomfortable.  I just want to say things as I see it.  I trust Monz<br/>implicitly and see no signs of anything but ebullient generosity.  So I<br/>suppose I am coming from something like a matter of principle here, and<br/>&quot;principle&quot; in that sense can be a tired old creature.

The tunings lists, archives, and file upload<br/>&gt; areas would go in the separate tunings list domain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is the difference between these two options to you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are a key member of this community and your presence<br/>&gt; on the tunings list will help to promote your company.<br/>&gt; I am all for promoting your company, expecially considering<br/>&gt; your generosity to this community.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also see a potential political problem with the tunings<br/>&gt; list as an independent semi-academic community being<br/>&gt; affiliated with a particular company&apos;s domain.  It could<br/>&gt; conceivably be sort of like having audio DSP discussion groups<br/>&gt; hosted on the <a href="http://steinberg.de">steinberg.de</a> website.  Except no I would<br/>&gt; never be likely to compare Monz&apos;s company with steinberg,<br/>&gt; so this is an exhaggeration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The advantage of using yahoogroups is that it is pretty much<br/>&gt; guaranteed to be a politcally neutral situation.  As I reflect<br/>&gt; on alternatives, besides issues of stability of hosting, no<br/>&gt; matter who else offered hosting, there would be biases of<br/>&gt; various kinds involved.  If I were to offer hosting, I<br/>&gt; would have to ask who would want me hosting anything?  How<br/>&gt; would they know how my biases might interfere with the good<br/>&gt; of the community?  What guarantee would they have?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So here is the thing:  I would hate to *ever* see the tunings<br/>&gt; list community fragment for political reasons.  I would want<br/>&gt; to insure against this somehow.  One way to achieve this is<br/>&gt; to have a separaate domain, for Monz to agree to host that<br/>&gt; domain, and to agree to let it go free if the need ever<br/>&gt; came up.  The details could be worked out for how to make<br/>&gt; this possible at the technical level.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope bringing this up doesn&apos;t create discomfort - well it<br/>&gt; has - I am uncomfortable.  I just want to say things as I<br/>&gt; see it.  I trust Monz implicitly and see no signs of<br/>&gt; anything but ebullient generosity.  So I suppose I am coming<br/>&gt; from something like a matter of principle here, and<br/>&gt; &quot;principle&quot; in that sense can be a tired old creature.<br/>&gt; But another way to say it is that it is a good thing to<br/>&gt; avoid &quot;forms&quot; that are potentially problematic, when there<br/>&gt; are alternatives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, it is also fair that as long as Monz/tonalsoft are<br/>&gt; doing hosting that they get something back for it.  I would<br/>&gt; rather that exclude the sharing of a domain.

I agree we can trust you to do what you believe is<br/>good.  So this is one of the reasons to discuss it - to make sure your<br/>beliefs are well-informed.</p><p>I want to get straight to the most important essence of the matter:  can you<br/>acknowledge that moving the lists etc to tonalsoft might *not* be the best<br/>thing for the community, and that it actually warants discussion?  Can you<br/>move forward with us without making any assumptions about the form it should<br/>take?  I know you have a dream and we are part of it.

The fact is I see the tunings list in<br/>my future - it is also part of my dream, and I want to take care that it is<br/>sustained.)</p><p>So while your dream is good, I think it needs more &quot;definition&quot;.  I think it<br/>is too homogenous in your mind, relatively new to you and not sorted out.  I<br/>challenge you to sort out your relationship to this community and to<br/>differentiate it from your personal dream.</p><p>Also consider one thing:  your company could go belly up (especially if any<br/>outside funding is involved) and you could die.

I would say because of the risks there would be no<br/>point in having the lists hosted at tonalsoft except for the<br/>tonalsoft-specific lists.  And even if you want to host them, using another<br/>domain should be of no consequence.  You could advertise that you host the<br/>other domain I am proposing - but you need not own it in order to do that<br/>(nor should you host the DNS) and it is also a good thing to not use any<br/>proprietary technology to serve the other domain, so that if worst came to<br/>worst the domain could be fully up and running within the time it takes for<br/>DNS to change over, as long as good plans are made for this possibility -<br/>and we should be sure to make those plans and test them.</p><p>&gt; i&apos;m really sorry if this rubs people the wrong way, but<br/>&gt; my energies from now on will have to be focused on my company<br/>&gt; and what it produces ... which, aside from the software,<br/>&gt; will be pretty much everything that i&apos;m already producing now:<br/>&gt; compositions, CDs, scores, essays, books, webpages, etc.</p><p>Yes, and who hosts the non-tonalsoft-specific lists should make no<br/>difference to you then.  You can participate in them all the same and if you<br/>do not create &quot;redundant&quot; (no derogatory sense intended) lists then you<br/>would not increase the burden on your time.</p><p>&gt; Tonalsoft will also be offering itself as a publishing company<br/>&gt; for CDs, books, and scores, too, so hopefully many others<br/>&gt; will become &quot;part of the family&quot;.</p><p>Yes, and this is great and obviously *very* needed.

E.g. a triad has in its narrow version a nearby neutral third, in the wide version this is clearly a minor third.<br/>For Scala users:<br/>Command: EQUAL 8/7 10 ... but I do not get it together in all details.
