This is probably a coincidence, but sort of nifty....Did<br/>you ever notice that 1) the &apos;chord of nature&apos;, the dominant seventh<br/>chord, is produced by harmonics 1-3-5-7, which is the 4th term of the<br/>square number series 1+3=4,1+3+5=9, 1+3+5+7=16, etc, and that 2) the<br/>diaganol of a square, square root of 2, is approximated by the<br/>fraction 7/5, which is the tritone at the heart of the dominant<br/>seventh chord&apos;s character?  You can see how number series can be<br/>addictive.  (Well, as long as the notes sound good too!)... Kelly<br/>(aka Monty)</p></div>
