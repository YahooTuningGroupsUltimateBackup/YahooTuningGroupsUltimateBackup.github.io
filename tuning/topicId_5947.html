Tickets are $10. For<br/>information and reservations, call 212-219-2527.</p><p>Continuing the legacy of his mentors, the minimalist composers La Monte<br/>Young<br/>and Terry Riley, and the legendary North Indian vocalist Pandit Pran<br/>Nath,<br/>Harrison&apos;s mesmerizing music and unique &quot;harmonic tuning&quot; draw on the<br/>natural<br/>musical scales and just-intonation tunings from the Pythagorean<br/>tradition of<br/>ancient Greece, as well as India, China and pre-Baroque Europe.<br/>Characterized by poignant melodies, rich harmonies, and multi-layered<br/>rhythmic patterns, his unique Indian-raga/African rhythm-inspired<br/>compositions shimmer with exotic sounds and luminous overtones. His<br/>acclaimed epic work, From Ancient Worlds, combines traditional harmony<br/>with<br/>modes and tunings rarely heard in Western music and gives full range to<br/>the<br/>sonic possibilities of the unusual, refined voicings of his music.</p><p>Michael Harrison received training in classical and jazz piano and went<br/>on to<br/>study composition at The Juilliard School. In 1978, he began intensive<br/>study<br/>with the renowned mystic singer Pandit Pran Nath and remained a close<br/>disciple until the master&apos;s passing in 1996. Fascinated with the<br/>resonances<br/>created by the Indian overtone-based tuning system, he continued his<br/>studies<br/>with innovative composers La Monte Young in New York and Terry Riley in<br/>California. Applying these ancient tuning principals to the piano, he<br/>created the &quot;harmonic piano,&quot; a uniquely customized grand piano designed<br/>to<br/>alternate between two different tunings with one keyboard. Through his<br/>expertise in &quot;just intonation&quot; tuning systems and North Indian ragas,<br/>combined with a deep understanding of Indian and Middle Eastern rhythms,<br/>and<br/>his innate gift for melodic composition, groundbreaking pianist/composer<br/>Michael Harrison has created revolutionary new music for the piano.</p><p>&quot;Harrison evokes glorious clouds of harmonics, from which emerge peals<br/>of<br/>divine thunder, angel choirs, celestial bells. Profoundly soothing,<br/>[From<br/>Ancient Worlds] constantly surprises with sparkling new sonorities.&quot;<br/>-- Sandy McCroskey, The Nation</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>*  J u x t a p o s i t i o n  N e t  R a d i o<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
