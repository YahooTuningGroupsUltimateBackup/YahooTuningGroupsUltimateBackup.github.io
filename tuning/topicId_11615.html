I am new to e-groups.</p><p>Oldest musical score</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;In Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra) in Syria, an ancient tablet<br/>was<br/>&gt;discovered in the 1950s dating back to 1400 BC.  The<br/>oldest known<br/>&gt;musical score, it takes the form of interval names and<br/>number<br/>&gt;signs,<br/>&gt;and even has lyrics.  The text is identified as a hymn to<br/>the moon<br/>&gt;goddess Nikkal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There is some controversy among ancient musicologists<br/>over the<br/>&gt;proper<br/>&gt;interpretation of the notes, but all agree that it is a<br/>genuine<br/>&gt;musical score.  The markings were made in cuneiform<br/>(wedge-<br/>&gt;shaped<br/>&gt;symbols) in the Hurrian language, and there is an exact<br/>&gt;correspondence between the syllables of the text and the<br/>musical<br/>&gt;notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The find was especially interesting because it overturned<br/>&gt;conventional views of ancient music, showing that the<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt;(7-note) scale and musical harmony were in use more than<br/>a<br/>&gt;thousand<br/>&gt;years earlier than was thought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Listen to the song and read about the different<br/>interpretations:</p><p><a href="http://members.aol.com/jazzdd/index.htm/westhuri.htm">http://members.aol.com/jazzdd/index.htm/westhuri.htm</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;More about the &quot;oldest song in the world&quot; with drawings<br/>of the<br/>&gt;tablet:</p><p><a href="http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/EVIDENCE.HTM">http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/EVIDENCE.HTM</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
