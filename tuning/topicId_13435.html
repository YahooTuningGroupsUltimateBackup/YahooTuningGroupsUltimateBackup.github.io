The Monz draws a parallel with other tuning situations where<br/>two &quot;cross-exponent&quot; prime factors (here the 11 and 7 of 14:11)<br/>consistently occur together rather than separately.</p><p>There&apos;s also a curious comment I added about the topic of fifths and<br/>fourths in tunings, and the question of octave affinity (not<br/>necessarily synonymous with absolute &quot;identity&quot; or &quot;equivalence,&quot; as<br/>we&apos;ve seen in the harmonic entropy discussions).</p><p>Finally, taking a look this evening at Partch&apos;s _Genesis of a Music_,<br/>I&apos;d like to comment on a certain &quot;cosmic humor&quot; in this tuning.</p><p>In his book, Partch is not especially enthusiastic about Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and specifically does _not_ endorse its use of high integer<br/>ratios based in powers of 3 (&quot;threeness&quot;) to define the gamut, with<br/>medieval European practice and theory taken as an example.</p><p>Further, Partch presents an 11-odd-limit system including the ratio<br/>14:11, but at least from what I quickly read, this may ratio may be of<br/>somewhat peripheral importance in his system -- comments from<br/>followers and interpreters of Partch being warmly invited.</p><p>Now along I come, from a strongly medieval European and Pythagorean<br/>perspective, and likely in good part because of Partch, who did make<br/>it part of his system, hear about the 14:11. My response is: &quot;That&apos;s<br/>an interesting proportion for a large major third, it might expand<br/>very nicely to a fifth -- and the numbers somehow are very pleasing to<br/>me.&quot;</p><p>One of the results is a &quot;JI&quot; system which has a major third at D-F# --<br/>which I wasn&apos;t even specifically considering when designing the system<br/>-- at 12544:9801. Of course, my reaction was: &quot;What a neat and<br/>unexpected bonus!&quot; Yes, I find this interval musically very pleasing<br/>also, especially in a couple of common Gothic-style cadences, a topic<br/>for another post.</p><p>At least until someone corrects me, may I share my impression that<br/>maybe the 14:11 is the not the most clearly defined and recognizable<br/>of all the intervals I could have chosen from Partch&apos;s 43-note system,<br/>and maybe my choice is quite in character.</p><p>The moral of all this: maybe that &quot;JI&quot; can mean very different things<br/>to different people, and that some very creative cross-fertilization<br/>can occur even between radically divergent theories and musics.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2000 9:02:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
