In contrast, the unison (1:1) is<br/>unisonal.</p><p>Jacobus of Liege discusses some of these terms in his _Speculum<br/>musicae_ of around 1325 or so, so that they are still of interest to<br/>him, although he mainly follows one variant of the usual kind of<br/>13th-century scale of concord/discord with four, five, or six<br/>categories with various degrees of &quot;perfect&quot; (pure) or &quot;imperfect&quot;<br/>(partial) blending or tension.</p><p>In one standard kind of 13th-century ranking, the unison and octave<br/>are indeed grouped together as &quot;perfect concords,&quot; and the fifth and<br/>fourth as &quot;intermediate concords.&quot; This is rather analogous to the<br/>earlier distinction between unisonal or equisonal intervals (unisons,<br/>octaves) and other &quot;consonances&quot; or _symphoniae_, the fifth (3:2) and<br/>fourth (4:3), which in medieval polyphony represent the point of<br/>rich and saturated stable concord.</p><p>The idea of gradations of tension among the unstable intervals --<br/>indeed collectively known as &quot;dissonances&quot; in Greek theory -- seems<br/>implicitly presented by Guido (c. 1030), who in addition to unisons<br/>and fourths endorses the use in _diaphonia_ or polyphony of minor<br/>thirds (32:27), major thirds (81:64), and whole-tones (9:8), while<br/>excluding minor seconds (256:243) and tritones (729:512).</p><p>In 13th-century terms, the intervals which Guido admits all have some<br/>degree of &quot;compatibility,&quot; while the minor second and tritone are<br/>&quot;perfect discords,&quot; that is, &quot;perfectly&quot; or thoroughly &quot;incompatible.&quot;<br/>This doesn&apos;t stop them from being used boldly and beautifully in<br/>13th-century music, however!</p><p>One fine issue which Jacobus and other theorists address: is the<br/>unison itself a &quot;concord,&quot; or rather the beginning of concord. Jacobus<br/>himself suggests, if I am reading him correctly, that a unison is not<br/>a concord if produced by a single voice or instrument, but is if two<br/>or more singers or instruments come together at a unison, since here<br/>there is at once a plurality of sounds and a unity of ratio.</p><p>May I add that the _Musica enchiriadis_ and _Schola enchiriadis_ are<br/>among my favorite musical treatises, a discovery of my secondary<br/>school days when I found out my love of fifths and fourths and would<br/>play them in parallel on the music room piano with rapt enjoyment.  It<br/>was amusing when I remarked that a note of the piano must be &quot;out of<br/>tune,&quot; and was quickly educated as to what a tritone is.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
