Any thoughts?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be 1-EDx/x, where x/x is the comma you&apos;re not tempering out.</p><p>To clarify further, these are my initial half-formed thoughts, so they<br/>probably don&apos;t make complete sense. I wasn&apos;t going to post them until<br/>I had things worked out more, so tread with extreme caution. but since<br/>Igs brings it up, I might as well explain what train of thought I&apos;m<br/>on.</p><p>The &quot;detempering&quot; in this sense is not the same thing as detempering<br/>in regular mapping in that it doesn&apos;t elevate the dimensionality of<br/>the space you&apos;re working within. 1-EDO puts us at rank 1, and the only<br/>interval there is is 2/1. Then, if we&apos;re trying to -ACTUALLY- detemper<br/>one step further to go to rank-2, you could end up with an unspecified<br/>1L1s scale in which all possible choices of generator (except for 2/1)<br/>are equated. I used the word that they&apos;re &quot;tempered together&quot; in my<br/>email, which was probably a poor choice. I am denoting, in a sense,<br/>&quot;paradigms&quot; rather than temperaments.</p><p>What I&apos;m saying is that in this 1L1s scale, the generator could be<br/>anything from 0 to 600 cents, which we could represent as being -any-<br/>generator except for 2/1 and its multiples. So Igs brought up 3L1s<br/>scales - assuming we&apos;re in the 5-limit, the generator could be either<br/>6/5 or 5/4, so I thought it would make sense to say that the generator<br/>is both, and we&apos;re in some &quot;dicot&quot;-based primitive, as per the recent<br/>definition of primitive.</p><p>The children of 3L1s are going to be 4L3s and 3L4s; the former maps<br/>best to things like hanson and amity, which have generators of 6/5,<br/>and the latter maps best to things like dicot and magic, which have<br/>generators of 5/4. So as you go further down the scale tree, the two<br/>split off. So in light of that, rather than saying that 2L3s maps to<br/>the 3-limit pythagorean val, it makes more sense to say that mavila<br/>and meantone are &quot;tempered together&quot; there, and then split off at 5L2s<br/>and 2L5s.</p><p>This is obviously a different sense of &quot;tempering&quot; than with usual<br/>regular temperament, which is why I say that we&apos;re talking about<br/>paradigms. A paradigm is going to be something like a fuzzy set of<br/>vals with a membership function for each one, and different<br/>temperaments fit into different paradigms. In this case, we were<br/>exploring how to apply paradigms to nodes on the scale tree. For 1L1s<br/>your generator can range from 0 to 600 cents, which equates 25/24,<br/>16/15, 10/9, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, and 4/3, etc. This puts us at what, rank<br/>negative 3? But 1L1s &quot;equates&quot; them in a different sense.</p><p>I think that looking at projective Tenney tuning space, but taking the<br/>&quot;inverse&quot; of it in such a way that you look at space(1/x, 1/y) rather<br/>than space(x,y), might be interesting here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
