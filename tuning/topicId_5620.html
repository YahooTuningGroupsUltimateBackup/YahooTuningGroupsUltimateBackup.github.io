However, once the archives are posted, it<br/>would be a good gesture to offer all contributors the opportunity to remove<br/>any of their own postings. Any other kinds of editing or revisions of the<br/>texts would be too much work, but the opportunity to retract an item should<br/>be reserved for every writer.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
