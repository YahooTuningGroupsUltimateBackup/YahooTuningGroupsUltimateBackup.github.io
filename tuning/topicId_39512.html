These intervals all are within Partch&apos;s 17-odd-limit system,<br/>and less complex than 17:13 (a*b=221) at one point proposed as an<br/>example of a ratio tuneable by ear.</p><p>The complication is that with 14:11 and 13:11, the fifth&apos;s complements<br/>have considerably more complex ratios of 33:28 and 33:26, raising the<br/>limit from 11-odd or 13-odd to 33-odd for something like 22:28:33 or<br/>22:26:33.</p><p>Since I routinely conceptualize about things like &quot;a pure 33:42:56,&quot;<br/>my perspective on this type of &quot;just temperament,&quot; as I call it, could<br/>be quite different than that of someone not so oriented to these types<br/>of ratios for regular thirds and sixths.</p><p>What such an otherwise inclined listener might notice, however, is the<br/>way that some fifths and fourths are pure while others are not quite<br/>five cents wide of pure.</p><p>Whether one takes this as an effort to get some &quot;pure&quot; ratios in<br/>mildly unstable sonorities like 22:28:33 or 22:26:33, or simply to<br/>have some pure 2:3:4 sonorities along with regular thirds somwhere<br/>around 413-418 cents and 284-289 cents, it&apos;s the contrast in the just<br/>or virtually tempered quality of the fifths and fourths that makes<br/>this approach distinct from a regular temperament yielding similar sizes<br/>of thirds.</p><p>Gene, I agree that &quot;just temperament&quot; can have different<br/>interpretations, with the reading of a &quot;virtually just&quot; tuning (or<br/>&quot;perceptually just&quot; one, to use Dave Keenan&apos;s explanation) as one<br/>approach.</p><p>Sometimes the same problem might have solutions using &quot;just<br/>temperament&quot; in more than interpretation.</p><p>For example, to get pure or &quot;virtually pure&quot; ratios of 3 and 7, we<br/>might either use Graham&apos;s 1/14-schisma temperament (i.e. the 3-7<br/>schisma of ~3.80 cents) realized almost precisely by 135-EDO; or place<br/>two Pythagorean chains at the precise distance of 64:63, &quot;virtually<br/>tempering&quot; one fifth by the full schisma, and giving it a size very<br/>close to 10/17 octave.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
