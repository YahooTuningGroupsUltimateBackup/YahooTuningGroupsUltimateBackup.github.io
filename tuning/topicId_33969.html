If<br/>you could map temperament vs time, the list might go something like this:</p><p>&quot;12 12 12 12 24 12 12 12 12 ...&quot;</p><p>At the point the quartertone is hit, there it is, it&apos;s in 24.  At any other<br/>point, you could say it&apos;s in 12.</p><p>If you had a little more leading up to and away from it, somehow, it would<br/>feel something like this:</p><p>&quot;Normal, normal, normal, hey that weird note is coming, BWONK, wasn&apos;t that<br/>strange, back to normal, normal, normal...&quot;</p><p>If you could imagine why I was thinking of the afterglow effect, unless you<br/>really psyche yourself into this being a &quot;quartertone piece&quot;, per se, the<br/>context is going to shift in and out of that one moment, if you have a solid<br/>sense of what 12 sounds like.</p><p>Personally, I think it&apos;s much more likely to be this than &quot;normal normal<br/>normal normal QUARTERTONE aaaa what was that oh no nothing will ever be the<br/>same, quartertone,<br/>quartertone,<br/>Quartertone...</p><p>In a sense, this just pierced the center of all my work.  The idea that one<br/>note could cause that much of a change in your sense of context is really<br/>the bottom line in terms of whether something is traumatic or not.  In the<br/>first case, if you can get back to normal, it wasn&apos;t.  In the second case,<br/>it comes back to affect you, so it is traumatic.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>Before looking at this in terms of 12 vs 24, you can do the same thing<br/>within 12 by itself.  Consider playing a major scale oriented piece for<br/>awhile and throw in a minor chord.  It&apos;s going to sound strange at first.</p><p>That&sup1;s just it.  If it&apos;s just a matter of 12 is in 24, for that matter, 24<br/>is in 48, 120, 24000 etc.  What it really comes down to in non prime<br/>temperaments, if their factors are at all relevant, is at what point are you<br/>interpolating with the multiple, and how much, and how severe.  The bottom<br/>line is EXACTLY WHAT NOTES are you using.</p><p>&quot;Acoustically&quot;:</p><p>All of the above only really applies to the case of the non-guitar.  Any<br/>acoustic instrument that doesn&apos;t have a temperament-specific resonance is<br/>what I was talking about.  Basically any instrument, piano, winds, brass,<br/>strings, anything you tune a note to, within the context of every other note<br/>you hear from it, forms a sort of overall image of what&apos;s going on, and all<br/>of your temperament and harmonic issues can work themselves out.</p><p>Actually I&apos;d have to cut that back a little because this is 100 percent true<br/>in electronic timbre that doesn&apos;t have any acoustic stake once it&apos;s out of<br/>the machine.  That on second thought, the acoustic instruments that resonate<br/>*a little*, MIGHT actually have a low volume kickback that might have some<br/>interesting subtle effects on the next note.  But in general, you hear what<br/>you play and that&apos;s it.</p><p>The placement of frets on a guitar drastically affects the timbre.  I was<br/>always completely amazed that all of my interchangeable boards sound<br/>completely different on the SAME GUITAR.  This mystified me for years.<br/>After about the last 10 years of trying to figure out the whole<br/>microacoustic deal behind that, a couple months ago I started getting the<br/>idea a little.</p><p>You might think &quot;maybe it&apos;s just the wood&quot;.  I did.  For that matter, I have<br/>to mention this.  One of my first METAL fretted guitars was a 34.  Not 34<br/>like it&apos;s 32 and someone said it was 34.  COUGH COUGH.  It was a 34 :)  I<br/>had it for quite a few months.  I&apos;d also wanted to try 17 so I figured I<br/>could do enough with 17 on the 34, since I only really had room for *one*<br/>more guitar at the time.  I was a bit disappointed in that suite though.  It<br/>didn&apos;t seem like 17 had as much power in its sharp fifths as I&apos;d imagined.</p><p>But why.</p><p>Here&apos;s an even thicker plot.  At one point I decided since it was such a<br/>cheap guitar, I&apos;d just pluck out every other fret and make the 34 a 17.  I<br/>thought one of the pickups was shot.  It DIDN&apos;T SOUND ANYTHING LIKE the 34.<br/>A much deeper tone.  None of the really high harmonics I&apos;d heard before.<br/>But you know what.  All of the diversity of the whole &quot;stretched&quot;<br/>Pythagorean or whatever you call it, believe me, it was there in full force.</p><p>Now for the life of me, for like 10 years, I could NOT understand how this<br/>same guitar, fretted in 34, could have such a beautiful tone and have such<br/>horrible sounding fifths.  And on the other hand, how could it have such a<br/>bludgeoning tone in 17 but have fifths you could sink your teeth into just a<br/>bit more than 12, enough to make it worthwhile?</p><p>I couldn&apos;t even imagine the physics to it, but I was sure it had something<br/>to do with THE FRETS, and their placement, and after very little thought, of<br/>course, it has something to do with the vibration of the string echoing down<br/>into the cavities between and back up into the string.  I often asked people<br/>to imagine a bare wall with sound reflecting off it, then imagine the wall<br/>with a BIRCH TREE every two feet.  You think it would change the sound JUST<br/>a little??</p><p>There&apos;s just something about a guitar ;)</p><p>So one day my friend Ken, the only person who&apos;s really been able to keep up<br/>with playing &quot;my guitars&quot; (the one who stood me up for the guitar quartet<br/>performance...) was working with my interchangeable.  I was sitting typing<br/>at the computer.  He hits this note... Waaaaaaaa... I said oh you wanted to<br/>check out the 46 huh I figured as much.  He was silent for a few minutes.  I<br/>kept typing oblivious.  I looked over and he had this look.  He said how did<br/>you KNOW it was 46?  I said because it sounded like it.  He said but... I<br/>only played one note.  Talk about &quot;WATSON COME HERE I NEED YOU&quot;... It&apos;s the<br/>stupidest thing, really, but it led to one of the most broad philosophical<br/>discussions about temperament and guitar.  We went into experiment mode and<br/>by the end of the day, much like the psychic playing card test, we were able<br/>to guess what temperament the other was playing by hearing one note.  We<br/>worked with, I think, 41, 43, 46 and 50.</p><p>You know what it is?  I have to say.  I HAVE TO give credit to the guy that<br/>came up with the show &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot;... If you&apos;ve ever<br/>seen them trying to solve a crime, as far as bullets hitting bones, they do<br/>this almost telepathic movie type footage and zooms all the way into the<br/>persons body and shows with computer graphics in slow motion the bullet<br/>breaking the bone.  Then whoosh, back out into the crime lab.  It&apos;s almost<br/>like you&apos;re getting a quick trip through hyperspace into the actual mental<br/>space where they&apos;re imagining what&apos;s happened, trying to reconstruct a<br/>crime.  With my stake in physics, I&apos;ve since started imagining quantum<br/>motion in time and space with that kind of CSI footage once in awhile.</p><p>If you&apos;d please forgive the size and structure of this huge analogy I&apos;m<br/>trying to lay out for you...</p><p>... I really put myself on the guitar string and moved as it would, and I<br/>FINALLY started understanding the root of ALL of this.  It&apos;s easy enough to<br/>imagine a sound wave as a sort of EKG of, say, one particle&apos;s testimony of<br/>having traveled up and down the string, and what intensities of energies it<br/>had found along the way.  I was SO CLOSE by thinking that the different size<br/>CAVITIES in fretboards of different temperaments would SUPRESS certain<br/>harmonics!!!  And this, to myself, is how I sulk thinking I ALWAYS MISS THE<br/>UTTERLY OBVIOUS.  The fact that the cavities muffle certain frequencies is<br/>only a distant symptom of the idea that the FRETS *REINFORCE* certain<br/>frequencies!!!  I mean DUH.</p><p>On a side note, if you think about what &quot;pinching&quot; a harmonic does, it&apos;s not<br/>so distantly related.</p><p>So think about starting at the bridge, and traveling to the nut, making the<br/>top half of a sort of sine wave.  Every time you hit a fret, you would get a<br/>sort of volume spike.  But this is the trick.  The distance between bridge<br/>and note describes the frequency in the first place.  So when you hit that<br/>volume spike, you&apos;re making a sort of goosebump which strongly suggests the<br/>note by fretting directly under it.  It teases, and passes, on to the next<br/>spike.  The trick is, that the distance in time from the beginning of the<br/>wave to every volume spike hints at EVERY NOTE IN THE TEMPERAMENT from the<br/>topmost fret down to the one you&apos;re playing!</p><p>In other words?  In simpler terms?</p><p>When you play one note in a fully fretted temperament, you hear traces of<br/>every other note in the temperament up an octave or so.  Alongside of those<br/>frequencies, you also have traces of the frequencies produced at the OTHER<br/>END of the string, which pigtail along as a temperament&apos;s own unique array<br/>of something along the lines of formants.</p><p>Simpler...</p><p>If you play one note on a microtonal guitar, you hear every note in the<br/>temperament.  You also hear its own &quot;vocal pattern&quot;.</p><p>Which is why I had problems between 34 and 17 on the same guitar despite<br/>each other.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard a few people say that playing a temperament within its double<br/>makes it counter-intuitive.</p><p>Long long ago, I played a 24.  I don&apos;t remember whose it was, or whether I&apos;d<br/>made it or not.  Playing 12 in fully fretted 24, sounded like whole tone<br/>scales.  It actually felt like playing 6 in 12, sort of floating along with<br/>no resolution.  That was long ago though.</p><p>But still, to answer your question:</p><p>1.  If you&apos;re playing an acoustic or electronic instrument, the sensitivity<br/>to a multiple temperament has more to do with how much of it you use versus<br/>its factor.</p><p>2.  If you&apos;re playing a GUITAR, the temperament lingers.  Heh heh.</p><p>Here&apos;s an idea Paul.  My next guitar quartet is going to be in 49.  There&apos;s<br/>a certain amount of it that&apos;s going to be in the 22 + 27 scale.  I would bet<br/>that if you (you, personally) played along with the retuned midi foundation,<br/>you&apos;d feel it was in 22.  And that if you played along with the final mix in<br/>49, that you would feel something along the lines of your hands being pulled<br/>away from the guitar in three different directions; sort of like you&apos;re<br/>almost playing the right guitar but there&apos;s something really wrong with the<br/>air today.</p><p>Actually I couldn&apos;t say what the effect of 22 under 49 would be.  Playing 31<br/>guitar under a 43 or 50 usually sounds like breaking glass, although in midi<br/>it makes it all the more rich.  Sort of the difference between mixing paint<br/>to black and mixing light to white.  Anyway I&apos;ll get you a copy of one of<br/>the 22 segments maybe in March or so.</p><p>Well anyway :)</p><p>I hope this gave you a little insight.  Actually Johnny Reinhard&apos;s<br/>sensitivity to increment of cents values and my sensitivity to increment of<br/>temperament density all but negate each other.  One desensitizes you to the<br/>other, almost like reciprocals.</p><p>Thanks for thinking of me.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3><a id=34041 href="#34041">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2002 6:22:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_33969.html#33976">/tuning/topicId_33969.html#33976</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; of course one can use this approach with any tuning, but<br/>&gt; i find that certain edos (the usual suspects: 17, 19, 31,<br/>&gt; 55, 72, etc.) have such good approximations to at least<br/>&gt; a few important JI ratios that it&apos;s hard for me to get<br/>&gt; away from all the *thinking* that automatically accompanies<br/>&gt; sonorities with whose mathematics i&apos;m so familiar. 24edo<br/>&gt; solves that problem for me by not offering much beyond<br/>&gt; 3, in terms of approximating prime-factors well.  so it<br/>&gt; gives me a freedom to simply play with the sound that i<br/>&gt; can&apos;t capture for the other tunings.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****This is a *fascinating* post, Monz!

At any<br/>other<br/>point, you could say it&apos;s in 12.</p><p>If you had a little more leading up to and away from it, somehow, it<br/>would<br/>feel something like this:</p><p>&quot;Normal, normal, normal, hey that weird note is coming, BWONK, wasn&apos;t<br/>that<br/>strange, back to normal, normal, normal...&quot;</p><p>If you could imagine why I was thinking of the afterglow effect,<br/>unless you<br/>really psyche yourself into this being a &quot;quartertone piece&quot;, per se,<br/>the<br/>context is going to shift in and out of that one moment, if you have a<br/>solid<br/>sense of what 12 sounds like.</p><p>Personally, I think it&apos;s much more likely to be this than &quot;normal<br/>normal<br/>normal normal QUARTERTONE aaaa what was that oh no nothing will ever<br/>be the<br/>same, quartertone,<br/>quartertone,<br/>Quartertone...</p><p>In a sense, this just pierced the center of all my work.  The idea<br/>that one<br/>note could cause that much of a change in your sense of context is<br/>really<br/>the bottom line in terms of whether something is traumatic or not.  In<br/>the<br/>first case, if you can get back to normal, it wasn&apos;t.  In the second<br/>case,<br/>it comes back to affect you, so it is traumatic.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>Before looking at this in terms of 12 vs 24, you can do the same thing<br/>within 12 by itself.  Consider playing a major scale oriented piece<br/>for<br/>awhile and throw in a minor chord.  It&apos;s going to sound strange at<br/>first.</p><p>That&iuml;&iquest;&half;s just it.  If it&apos;s just a matter of 12 is in 24, for that<br/>matter, 24<br/>is in 48, 120, 24000 etc.  What it really comes down to in non prime<br/>temperaments, if their factors are at all relevant, is at what point<br/>are you<br/>interpolating with the multiple, and how much, and how severe.  The<br/>bottom<br/>line is EXACTLY WHAT NOTES are you using.</p><p>&quot;Acoustically&quot;:</p><p>All of the above only really applies to the case of the non-guitar.<br/>Any<br/>acoustic instrument that doesn&apos;t have a temperament-specific resonance<br/>is<br/>what I was talking about.  Basically any instrument, piano, winds,<br/>brass,<br/>strings, anything you tune a note to, within the context of every<br/>other note<br/>you hear from it, forms a sort of overall image of what&apos;s going on,<br/>and all<br/>of your temperament and harmonic issues can work themselves out.</p><p>Actually I&apos;d have to cut that back a little because this is 100<br/>percent true<br/>in electronic timbre that doesn&apos;t have any acoustic stake once it&apos;s<br/>out of<br/>the machine.  That on second thought, the acoustic instruments that<br/>resonate<br/>*a little*, MIGHT actually have a low volume kickback that might have<br/>some<br/>interesting subtle effects on the next note.  But in general, you hear<br/>what<br/>you play and that&apos;s it.</p><p>The placement of frets on a guitar drastically affects the timbre.  I<br/>was<br/>always completely amazed that all of my interchangeable boards sound<br/>completely different on the SAME GUITAR.  This mystified me for years.<br/>After about the last 10 years of trying to figure out the whole<br/>microacoustic deal behind that, a couple months ago I started getting<br/>the<br/>idea a little.</p><p>You might think &quot;maybe it&apos;s just the wood&quot;.  I did.  For that matter,<br/>I have<br/>to mention this.  One of my first METAL fretted guitars was a 34.  Not<br/>34<br/>like it&apos;s 32 and someone said it was 34.  COUGH COUGH.  It was a 34 :)<br/>I<br/>had it for quite a few months.  I&apos;d also wanted to try 17 so I figured<br/>I<br/>could do enough with 17 on the 34, since I only really had room for<br/>*one*<br/>more guitar at the time.  I was a bit disappointed in that suite<br/>though.  It<br/>didn&apos;t seem like 17 had as much power in its sharp fifths as I&apos;d<br/>imagined.</p><p>But why.</p><p>Here&apos;s an even thicker plot.  At one point I decided since it was such<br/>a<br/>cheap guitar, I&apos;d just pluck out every other fret and make the 34 a<br/>17.  I<br/>thought one of the pickups was shot.  It DIDN&apos;T SOUND ANYTHING LIKE<br/>the 34.<br/>A much deeper tone.  None of the really high harmonics I&apos;d heard<br/>before.<br/>But you know what.  All of the diversity of the whole &quot;stretched&quot;<br/>Pythagorean or whatever you call it, believe me, it was there in full<br/>force.</p><p>Now for the life of me, for like 10 years, I could NOT understand how<br/>this<br/>same guitar, fretted in 34, could have such a beautiful tone and have<br/>such<br/>horrible sounding fifths.  And on the other hand, how could it have<br/>such a<br/>bludgeoning tone in 17 but have fifths you could sink your teeth into<br/>just a<br/>bit more than 12, enough to make it worthwhile?</p><p>I couldn&apos;t even imagine the physics to it, but I was sure it had<br/>something<br/>to do with THE FRETS, and their placement, and after very little<br/>thought, of<br/>course, it has something to do with the vibration of the string<br/>echoing down<br/>into the cavities between and back up into the string.  I often asked<br/>people<br/>to imagine a bare wall with sound reflecting off it, then imagine the<br/>wall<br/>with a BIRCH TREE every two feet.  You think it would change the sound<br/>JUST<br/>a little??</p><p>There&apos;s just something about a guitar ;)</p><p>So one day my friend Ken, the only person who&apos;s really been able to<br/>keep up<br/>with playing &quot;my guitars&quot; (the one who stood me up for the guitar<br/>quartet<br/>performance...) was working with my interchangeable.  I was sitting<br/>typing<br/>at the computer.  He hits this note... Waaaaaaaa... I said oh you<br/>wanted to<br/>check out the 46 huh I figured as much.  He was silent for a few<br/>minutes.  I<br/>kept typing oblivious.  I looked over and he had this look.  He said<br/>how did<br/>you KNOW it was 46?  I said because it sounded like it.  He said<br/>but... I<br/>only played one note.  Talk about &quot;WATSON COME HERE I NEED YOU&quot;...<br/>It&apos;s the<br/>stupidest thing, really, but it led to one of the most broad<br/>philosophical<br/>discussions about temperament and guitar.  We went into experiment<br/>mode and<br/>by the end of the day, much like the psychic playing card test, we<br/>were able<br/>to guess what temperament the other was playing by hearing one note.<br/>We<br/>worked with, I think, 41, 43, 46 and 50.</p><p>You know what it is?  I have to say.  I HAVE TO give credit to the guy<br/>that<br/>came up with the show &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot;... If you&apos;ve<br/>ever<br/>seen them trying to solve a crime, as far as bullets hitting bones,<br/>they do<br/>this almost telepathic movie type footage and zooms all the way into<br/>the<br/>persons body and shows with computer graphics in slow motion the<br/>bullet<br/>breaking the bone.  Then whoosh, back out into the crime lab.  It&apos;s<br/>almost<br/>like you&apos;re getting a quick trip through hyperspace into the actual<br/>mental<br/>space where they&apos;re imagining what&apos;s happened, trying to reconstruct a<br/>crime.  With my stake in physics, I&apos;ve since started imagining quantum<br/>motion in time and space with that kind of CSI footage once in awhile.</p><p>If you&apos;d please forgive the size and structure of this huge analogy<br/>I&apos;m<br/>trying to lay out for you...</p><p>... I really put myself on the guitar string and moved as it would,<br/>and I<br/>FINALLY started understanding the root of ALL of this.  It&apos;s easy<br/>enough to<br/>imagine a sound wave as a sort of EKG of, say, one particle&apos;s<br/>testimony of<br/>having traveled up and down the string, and what intensities of<br/>energies it<br/>had found along the way.  I was SO CLOSE by thinking that the<br/>different size<br/>CAVITIES in fretboards of different temperaments would SUPRESS certain<br/>harmonics!!!  And this, to myself, is how I sulk thinking I ALWAYS<br/>MISS THE<br/>UTTERLY OBVIOUS.  The fact that the cavities muffle certain<br/>frequencies is<br/>only a distant symptom of the idea that the FRETS *REINFORCE* certain<br/>frequencies!!!  I mean DUH.</p><p>On a side note, if you think about what &quot;pinching&quot; a harmonic does,<br/>it&apos;s not<br/>so distantly related.</p><p>So think about starting at the bridge, and traveling to the nut,<br/>making the<br/>top half of a sort of sine wave.  Every time you hit a fret, you would<br/>get a<br/>sort of volume spike.  But this is the trick.  The distance between<br/>bridge<br/>and note describes the frequency in the first place.  So when you hit<br/>that<br/>volume spike, you&apos;re making a sort of goosebump which strongly<br/>suggests the<br/>note by fretting directly under it.  It teases, and passes, on to the<br/>next<br/>spike.  The trick is, that the distance in time from the beginning of<br/>the<br/>wave to every volume spike hints at EVERY NOTE IN THE TEMPERAMENT from<br/>the<br/>topmost fret down to the one you&apos;re playing!</p><p>In other words?  In simpler terms?</p><p>When you play one note in a fully fretted temperament, you hear traces<br/>of<br/>every other note in the temperament up an octave or so.  Alongside of<br/>those<br/>frequencies, you also have traces of the frequencies produced at the<br/>OTHER<br/>END of the string, which pigtail along as a temperament&apos;s own unique<br/>array<br/>of something along the lines of formants.</p><p>Simpler...</p><p>If you play one note on a microtonal guitar, you hear every note in<br/>the<br/>temperament.  You also hear its own &quot;vocal pattern&quot;.</p><p>Which is why I had problems between 34 and 17 on the same guitar<br/>despite<br/>each other.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard a few people say that playing a temperament within its<br/>double<br/>makes it counter-intuitive.</p><p>Long long ago, I played a 24.  I don&apos;t remember whose it was, or<br/>whether I&apos;d<br/>made it or not.  Playing 12 in fully fretted 24, sounded like whole<br/>tone<br/>scales.  It actually felt like playing 6 in 12, sort of floating along<br/>with<br/>no resolution.  That was long ago though.</p><p>But still, to answer your question:</p><p>1.  If you&apos;re playing an acoustic or electronic instrument, the<br/>sensitivity<br/>to a multiple temperament has more to do with how much of it you use<br/>versus<br/>its factor.</p><p>2.  If you&apos;re playing a GUITAR, the temperament lingers.  Heh heh.</p><p>Here&apos;s an idea Paul.  My next guitar quartet is going to be in 49.<br/>There&apos;s<br/>a certain amount of it that&apos;s going to be in the 22 + 27 scale.  I<br/>would bet<br/>that if you (you, personally) played along with the retuned midi<br/>foundation,<br/>you&apos;d feel it was in 22.  And that if you played along with the final<br/>mix in<br/>49, that you would feel something along the lines of your hands being<br/>pulled<br/>away from the guitar in three different directions; sort of like<br/>you&apos;re<br/>almost playing the right guitar but there&apos;s something really wrong<br/>with the<br/>air today.</p><p>Actually I couldn&apos;t say what the effect of 22 under 49 would be.<br/>Playing 31<br/>guitar under a 43 or 50 usually sounds like breaking glass, although<br/>in midi<br/>it makes it all the more rich.  Sort of the difference between mixing<br/>paint<br/>to black and mixing light to white.  Anyway I&apos;ll get you a copy of one<br/>of<br/>the 22 segments maybe in March or so.</p><p>Well anyway :)</p><p>I hope this gave you a little insight.  Actually Johnny Reinhard&apos;s<br/>sensitivity to increment of cents values and my sensitivity to<br/>increment of<br/>temperament density all but negate each other.  One desensitizes you<br/>to the<br/>other, almost like reciprocals.</p><p>Thanks for thinking of me.</p><p>Marc</p><p>------------------------ Yahoo!

Why not look at a<br/>set of n-odd limit consonances plus their octave extensions?<br/>I guess at some point there will always be inconsistency there too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So I can&apos;t call an arbitrary mapping of primes to equal scale<br/>steps<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament?</p><p>&gt; In strict tuning-math terms, that will only be a different<br/>&gt; temperament if its GCD is 1. Otherwise it&apos;ll be identical to a<br/>&gt; simpler temperament obtained by putting the mapping in lowest<br/>terms.</p><p>Now I understand!</p><p>&gt; Similarly, if we consider tempering out commas, that comma<br/>shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; be the square or cube or higher power of some smaller comma,<br/>because<br/>&gt; it yields exactly the same temperament the smaller comma does.</p><p>With torsion?</p><p>&gt; &gt; What about some kind of &quot;standard&quot; mapping?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I can say there are various different definitions of standard<br/>&gt; mapping at this point . . . what was your question?</p><p>Nevermind. The above clarified it all to me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re interested in this kind of thing but in ET<br/>&gt; &gt; comparisons one could also multiply the error by the number of<br/>&gt; scale<br/>&gt; &gt; steps in an octave (for example). This way one can measure<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;practical utility&quot; of an ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yup, this is what we&apos;ve been calling &apos;badness&apos; on tuning-math.<br/>&gt; Indeed, we&apos;ve looked at a lot of different functions of error and<br/>&gt; complexity, not only error times complexity. It seems to Dave and<br/>me<br/>&gt; that tunings like 4296-tET, no matter how high their &apos;practical<br/>&gt; utility&apos; by this particular measure and even things like error<br/>times<br/>&gt; complexity squared, are not likely to be of widespread interest, so<br/>&gt; we&apos;ve been looking at things more like a*error + b*complexity . . .</p><p>That&apos;s why I used this (error times complexity) just to compare<br/>different *meantone* equal temperaments. I think it&apos;s a good way to<br/>compare ETs that contain the same scale for example. But you can<br/>always invent a different measure if you don&apos;t like the results. :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; If one compares 5-limit meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; equal temperaments, unweighted 5-odd limit minimax gives 19-equal<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; the best one. If one uses Tenney-weighted error the winner is<br/>&gt; &gt; actually 12-equal!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It must be a virtual tie . . .

Otherwise, the octaves will usually be<br/>tempered, and then yes I suppose you will see inconsistency when you<br/>look at some intervals extended by enough octaves -- but these may be<br/>inaudible in practice . . .</p></div><h3><a id=52332 href="#52332">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2004 2:05:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;But if you&apos;re reading, can you explain what SPAN has to say in<br/>&gt;&gt; 36/35 vs. 9/8 comparison?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; SPAN includes critical band effects,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hmm . . . that doesn&apos;t quite seem right to me.
