This usage has seen wide adoption on the<br/>&gt; tuning, tuning-math, and to some extent the makemicromusic lists,<br/>&gt; but a broad consensus has not emerged. Here are Gene&apos;s<br/>&gt; definitions (paraphrased) :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; scale- An ordered list of intervals, which may be applied to a<br/>&gt; given concert pitch to generate an ordered list of pitches that<br/>&gt; can be used to tune an instrument. Scala&apos;s scale file format<br/>&gt; (.scl extension) is an embodiment of this definition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; temperament- A mapping from just intonation to an abstract group<br/>&gt; of smaller rank. This algebraic definition basically means that<br/>&gt; for every interval in just intonation, which is composed of some<br/>&gt; combination of primes, we express it instead as a combination of<br/>&gt; generators (called the generators of the temperament) such that<br/>&gt; there are fewer generators than there were primes. For example,<br/>&gt; in 5-limit JI, every interval can be expressed as a combination<br/>&gt; of 2s, 3s, and 5s. In meantone temperament, every interval can<br/>&gt; be expressed as a combination of octaves and fifths. 5-limit JI<br/>&gt; is therefore a rank-3 intonation, and meantone a rank-2<br/>&gt; temperament. In 12-ET, every interval can be expressed as a<br/>&gt; combination of semitones. It is therefore a rank-1 temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; tuning- A choice of intervals for the generators of a<br/>&gt; temperament. For example, 1200 cents / 697 cents is a decent<br/>&gt; tuning for meantone. So is 1200 cents / 698 cents. They lead to<br/>&gt; different scales, but they are both good meantone tunings because<br/>&gt; they allow meantone temperament to produce good approximations<br/>&gt; of 5-limit JI. Sometimes tunings are named after the<br/>&gt; optimization they solve.

I would say it&apos;s subset of tuning, ordered list of steps, not intervals, as composer can work with almost any interval inside the possibilities defined by tuning and scale, scales tones can be used freely, not always in order up or down, so intervals are &quot;hidden&quot; in the scale, like another subset.</p><p>Scale can be created from steps of different size, in traditional music theory minimal size of step is small second, maximal size augmented second.</p><p>In 12ET and other historical tunings only chromatic scale is a special case when scale = tuning.</p><p>Scales don&apos;t need to have octave repetition even when tuning itself has octaves inside.</p><p>In traditional music theory abstract scales can be transposed (shifted) in the frame of tuning system, and can have more modes depending on number of possible rotations (different root notes).
