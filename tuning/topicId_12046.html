I&apos;ve<br/>checked<br/>&gt; out Csound and the Gigastudio so far.  I&apos;m looking for the best possible<br/>sampler<br/>&gt; in terms of quality first of all.  The Gigastudio looks like the best<br/>sampler<br/>&gt; over all.  I just don&apos;t know if it has microtonal features.  The Csound<br/>sounds<br/>&gt; like a dream machine.  I wonder how the samples are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which brings me to my question;  what are the best microtonal samplers and<br/>&gt; synths (hardware or software) around?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I&apos;m planning to automate whichever software synth I buy with a macro<br/>&gt; program.  I&apos;m using Macro Express 2000 for now.  Are there any better<br/>ones?<br/>&gt;</p><p>For a hardware sampler your only real choices are something from the Ensoniq<br/>EPS/EPS-16+/ASR-10 family or the Kurzweil 2000/2500/2600 family.  The<br/>Ensoniq samplers have 8 full range pitch tables per instrument, with a limit<br/>of 8 instruments total.  The Kurzweil synth/samplers can have 255 12 note<br/>per octave based tuning tables, applied globally to all instruments (up to<br/>1000), or you can accomplish any N-tone equal temperament using the<br/>techniques given at my web site:<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/k2x00eq.html">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/k2x00eq.html</a> .</p><p>Gigasampler cannot do microtonal scales.</p><p>CSound is an excellent tool for microtonality, but somewhat difficult from a<br/>programming interface.  I list several soft synths at my web site that are<br/>good candidates.  I personally use Reaktor which is quite powerful, but<br/>you&apos;ll still have to do a lot of tweaking of instruments to apply<br/>microtonality to them.  It is probably easier to use something like VAZ<br/>Modular or WAVmaker.</p><p>&quot;Best microtonal synth or sampler&quot; is dependent on your needs.  If you need<br/>the maximum flexibility and highest accuracy for microtonality, then KYMA<br/>and CSound seem to be the favorites, though I think WAVmaker should be in<br/>that category as well with virtually unlimited pitch accuracy and tuning<br/>tables.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:microtonal@worldnet.att.net">microtonal@worldnet.att.net</a><br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal">http://home.att.net/~microtonal</a></p></div><h3><a id=12048 href="#12048">ðŸ”—</a>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@teleport.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2000 8:39:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Re CSound ... yes, for a composer who is not a programmer, CSound can be<br/>difficult to use. However, I&apos;ve been a programmer for almost 40 years ... I<br/>find it easy enough. The hard part is not the programming, it&apos;s becoming a<br/>composer :-). I suspect it&apos;s easier for a composer to become enough of a<br/>programmer to use CSound than it is for a programmer to become enough of a<br/>composer.</p><p>If you do decide to investigate CSound, go out and spend the 50 bucks and<br/>pick up &quot;The CSound Book&quot; by Richard Boulanger. It comes with *two* CDs, is<br/>loaded with tutorials, pre-defined instruments and orchestras, quite a few<br/>student compositions and, of course, a working copy of CSound. There are<br/>quite a few composer-friendly wrappers around CSound; one in particular,<br/>Michael Gogins&apos; Silence, can be found at</p><p><a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~gogins/Silence/Silence.htm">http://www.pipeline.com/~gogins/Silence/Silence.htm</a></p><p>Re Sfront ... yes, I have that too.
