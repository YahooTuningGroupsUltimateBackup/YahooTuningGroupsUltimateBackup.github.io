I&apos;ve just been<br/>listening to bits of a highbrow arts programme on Radio Scotland . One<br/>of the items featured healing music and I gather that a new double CD<br/>called &apos;Monochord Music&apos; has been released on Village Life. The artist<br/>is Sonja ?  (missed the surname)  and that&apos;s all I can tell except to<br/>say that the music is not without aesthetic interest. On the healing<br/>front it appears that the patient lies down on the top of a large box<br/>and the healer plays around with the harmonic series on two strings. I&apos;m<br/>not sure how the various nodes are found and stopped but the whole<br/>affair seems to be a worthwhile addition to the JI ( low integer,<br/>rational, non-12, as you wish) repertoire.</p><p>Peace and Goodwill to All</p></div>
