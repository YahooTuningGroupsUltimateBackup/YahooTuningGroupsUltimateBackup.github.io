Looking at the harmonic_entropy<br/>list, I see that overnight, the membership has increased from 6 to 18, and<br/>there are 12 messages so far. Today I replied to Carl&apos;s <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a><br/>message about h.e. on the other list. I think we&apos;re off to a good start,<br/>though I&apos;m probably not going to be able to put serious time into the new<br/>calculations until after the Microthon . . .</p><p>Anyway, I think splitting the list was a good idea. Maybe there should be a<br/>lattice list too (remember all those lattices a while back)? As long as<br/>there are a few people on all the lists, so that they can refer questions<br/>from one to another, this should keep the volume more manageable. I came in<br/>to the office on Monday with 290 new e-mails to read. I diligently went<br/>through every one of them, but if I had a project due for work, I would have<br/>had to do some serious skimming. I can understand that many people would be<br/>frustrated in an attempt to follow everything going on, so being able to<br/>narrow down one&apos;s field of interest seems very valuable.</p><p>Anyway, no more posting about posting, OK?</p></div>
