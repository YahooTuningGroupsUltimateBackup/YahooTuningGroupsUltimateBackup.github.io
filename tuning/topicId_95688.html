As a 7-limit temperament, mohajira has a generator of a tempered 128/105; 128/105 is 385/384 sharper than 11/9, but the 7-limit POTE tuning is only a cent sharper. The 7-limit temperament tempers out 81/80 and 6148/6125; adding 385/384 to that gives 11-limit mohajira. So going up to 11 is a no-brainer. .</p></div><h3><a id=95692 href="#95692">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 7:06:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;     Good idea.

You take a double do loop, i from 1 to m, j from 1 to m, where m is the number of elements in the scale s. You compute s[j] - s[i] Mod N. If this is in your set c, you increment a counter by one.

If this all fits<br/>together as I think it does...it largely proves just how well the 9-tone<br/>Dimension tuning system complies with inter-locking scale systems under it (both<br/>Mohajira and Meantone) which maximize consonant dyads in the 3,5,7,9, and<br/>11-limit and can serve as a compositional &quot;extension&quot; that on one hand has a<br/>mode that complies with meantone and, on the other, can be optimum for higher<br/>limits as well.</p></div><h3><a id=95696 href="#95696">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 7:56:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;Let me expand on this.

Knuth&apos;s &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;<br/>Vol. 4A has several approaches depending on the order you want to generate<br/>the combinations. Looking through the ACM&apos;s collected algorithms should turn<br/>up similar results, if you don&apos;t have access to a copy of Knuth, either a<br/>personal or a library copy. If worse comes to worse, shoot me a note and<br/>I&apos;ll see if I can translate one of Knuth&apos;s algorithms into VB. It shouldn&apos;t<br/>be that hard, but VB isn&apos;t one of my better languages.</p><p>David Bowen</p><p>On Wed, Jan 19, 2011 at 11:17 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;Ah, that makes sense.
