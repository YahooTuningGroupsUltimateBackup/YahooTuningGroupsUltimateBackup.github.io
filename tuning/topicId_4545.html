It us easier to<br/>&gt;use and understand than Continued Fractions and converges slower as it<br/>&gt;shows semi-convergents as well. It is closely related to the CF<br/>&gt;algorithm as the number of times a given interval is subtracted is the<br/>&gt;sames as the corresponding divisor term of the CF.</p><p>But isn&apos;t the &quot;outer loop&quot; Canright is referring to equivalent to CF?<br/>I would hope so, since the CF convergents are the only ones for which<br/>one is guaranteed that there is no simpler fraction that yields a better<br/>approximation.</p></div>
