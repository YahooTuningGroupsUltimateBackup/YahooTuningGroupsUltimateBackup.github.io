Check it out.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>Gainesville FL</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m thinking of carving a fipple (duct) flute out of wood or bamboo to<br/>play<br/>&gt; my favorite scale: 1/1 16/15 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 16/9 2/1 (sounds Middle<br/>&gt; Eastern). Does anyone have any experience or suggestions with this sort of<br/>&gt; thing? Since it would have only harmonic partials and the pitch would be<br/>&gt; determined solely by the length of the air column, the calculation of the<br/>&gt; hole positions would be much easier than the infamous wind chimes.</p></div><h3><a id=10010 href="#10010">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;mtpepper@prodigy.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2000 8:56:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I would try the musical instrument makers forum and start a topic on<br/>fipple<br/>&gt; carving. <a href="http://www.mimf.com">www.mimf.com</a></p><p>Aha!</p><p>&gt; Or you can create fipple pipes ala Denny Genovese&apos;s invention.

I suspect longer length means you can go<br/>higher in the series, and it would also make it more difficult to play lower<br/>as well.  I would suggest using inexpensive metal conduit to experiment as<br/>this would be quicker than bamboo.  Denny&apos;s fipple pipes range from about 2<br/>or 3 feet to over 5 feet, if my memory serves me correctly.</p><p>Darren</p></div>
