Long time no email from me to this list -<br/>which is not to say I have unsubscribed.</p><p>Alison wrote:</p><p>&gt;I was referred to Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos;s work on new orchestral<br/>&gt;instruments...  I&apos;m sure he&apos;s a nice chap but where is he? He&apos;s not on<br/>&gt;this list which I would have thought a must given the level of debate<br/>&gt;here. I emailed his organisation ages ago as an interested party - no<br/>&gt;reply. Feels like a jobs-for-the-boys-sort of a deal what with all the<br/>&gt;proposed funding.</p><p>I can&apos;t comment on whether I&apos;m a nice chap or not (!) but scanning<br/>through the last tuning digest I noticed Alison&apos;s comments and feel I<br/>should reply.</p><p>Firstly, I&apos;m still in Norwich, (though I am hoping to move shortly).</p><p>Secondly, I&apos;m very sorry, but I strictly limit the amount of emailing I<br/>do - due to a major problem with my fingers/hands - caused (primarily)<br/>by too much typing.  (As a pianist, I prefer to conserve my fingers).<br/>I&apos;ve tried various dictation systems but they have been unbearably slow.<br/>As soon as I have any spare cash I&apos;d like to invest in a super-fast<br/>dictation-friendly PC which would make life alot more bearable.  However<br/>- I do scan this list regularly - though I don&apos;t attempt to follow every<br/>word.</p><p>Alison, I am very sorry if you sent me (or someone at CNMI?) an email<br/>and received no reply!  I have just searched my mailbox and your address<br/>is nowhere to be found (and I never delete addresses).  Please do email<br/>me again.</p><p>The much outdated &apos;21st Century Orchestral Instruments&apos; document<br/>(perhaps I should remove this from the web now?) did set out a<br/>philosophy of new acoustic instruments based on the premise that musical<br/>experiments with alternative tuning systems (ATS) warranted the<br/>application of new designs and technologies.  I did also argue that<br/>there would be some value in adopting a &apos;provisional ATS standard&apos;<br/>_for_the_initial_creation_of_a_complementary set_of_new_instruments.</p><p>Practically speaking I am still of the same opinion: essentially, I<br/>think its a good idea to propose a standard and build a set of<br/>complementary instruments which will help performers to realise new<br/>compositions.  After that, see how it goes, and maybe build something<br/>else. Inevitably, if pursued, the process will evolve.</p><p>However, I should add that my travels in 1998 strongly contradicted my<br/>naive hopes of finding consensus re standardisation: I found no<br/>consensus amongst the 300 composers, performers, instrument makers etc I<br/>met on that trip, nor did I find any _desire_ for consensus.<br/>Artistically that is probably a healthy situation.  But from the point<br/>of view of making new instruments it poses a significant problem.<br/>Perhaps discussions on this list have recently tended to suggest a move<br/>toward standardisation - but it must be accepted that there is a very<br/>significant field of 1/4-tone composers (and the like) who don&apos;t<br/>subscribe or contribute here.</p><p>My conclusion was that, from the point of view of initially proving the<br/>validity of new instrumental _technologies_ - it didn&apos;t matter too much<br/>which ATS was adopted.  Also, from a practical point of view, new<br/>instrument technologies were more likely to generate support funding<br/>than ATS per se.</p><p>You may know from the CNMI (Centre for New Musical Instruments) webpage</p><p><a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi</a></p><p>that CNMI won a grant from the Performing Rights Society Foundation to<br/>try to put something of this into practice.  In addition Boosey &amp; Hawkes<br/>have semi-donated a brass quintet which is now being converted so that<br/>some or all of the instruments will realise _both_ 19-ET and 24-ET (ie<br/>the same set of instruments provide both systems).  We are working with<br/>the British instrument manufacturer Trevor J. James to produce a 24-ET<br/>alto flute.  And there is also a project to create a modified bassett<br/>clarinet (not ATS).  It is intended that all these instruments will<br/>incorporate electromechanical mechanisms to enable tonehole closure or<br/>valve movements etc, thus providing the extended gamut.  Howver, all of<br/>these projects are still very much in their initial stages.</p><p>CNMI&apos;s activities are focussed on _new_instruments_, as the name is<br/>intended to suggest.  Although new tunings are one amongst a number of<br/>reasons for trying to create new instruments, CNMI is not a &apos;Centre for<br/>Microtonal (or ATS) Music&apos;.  But the basic long-term purpose _is_ to<br/>make &apos;New Instruments for New Music&apos;, and we would very much welcome<br/>discussion and potentially collaboration on the ways forward.  Again,<br/>I&apos;m very sorry if I have failed to reply to emails from anyone promoting<br/>discussion etc.  Please email again!</p><p>Some news from CNMI:</p><p>1) Thanks to the work of my chief collaborator, Lewis Jones, CNMI will<br/>almost certainly (as of tomorrow possibly!) become a recognised Centre<br/>of Research within London Guildhall University.  This doesn&apos;t mean the<br/>university will provide any direct financial support for the project  -<br/>but it is a step in the right direction.</p><p>2) We have made new UK funding bids - one at at an inter-university<br/>level, another with the purpose of appointing a composer-in-residence,<br/>to work alongside the new instrument developments.  Both are pending.</p><p>3) Further bids are planned. We are seeking to create a &apos;CNMI Project<br/>Portfolio&apos;, as an umbrella under which worthy projects might be able to<br/>participate and gain support.  Most of these will be instrument based,<br/>but they might also be in areas of fundamental research (such as<br/>materials, technology, design, acoustics and tuning theory) - as  well<br/>as composition and performance.  (I hope this is set out reasonably<br/>clearly on the webpages - if not, please let us know).  If you have in<br/>mind a project that is appropriate - please contact us!  Most of the<br/>funding we have researched is UK based, but it does also exist in the<br/>USA, and in the long-term it may be possible to pursue European funding.</p><p>More personal news, I proposed a new version of &apos;21st Century Orchestral<br/>Instruments&apos; to a publisher (Ashgate) last autumn, and have in fact<br/>signed a contract with them today!  The proposed book will have a new<br/>title, and, again, will focus primarily on instrument designs and<br/>technologies.  The tuning aspects will still be present, but the detail<br/>may largely be consigned to appendices (probably on CD-ROM, along with a<br/>full colour catalogue of instrument pictures, and hopefully some<br/>recordings of instruments - perhaps with examples of ATS).  But it is<br/>not likely to be in the shops before 2004!</p><p>Lastly, Lewis Jones and I will both be in Chicago next week (June 5)<br/>speaking at the Experimental Musical Instruments session of the<br/>Acoustical Society of America conference.
