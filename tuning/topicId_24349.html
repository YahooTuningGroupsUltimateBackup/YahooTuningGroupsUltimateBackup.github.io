A pretty good<br/>&gt; approximation to 12-tet may be made from a repeated series<br/>&gt; of pitches related as 16:17:18:19 ( I have references<br/>&gt; somewhere to Integer Ratio Chromatic Scales constructed just<br/>&gt; this way).</p><p>Sylvestro Ganassi&apos;s treatise (1543, _Regula Rubertina_, chapter 4)<br/>is the one I know which presents the chromatic scale this way.</p><p>While at first glance it does seem to give &quot;a pretty good<br/>approximation to 12-tet&quot;, a deeper look into this tuning<br/>reveals that it is an interesting well-temeperament.</p><p>I&apos;ve made a webpage about this tuning, reproducing what<br/>I write here, and also including an interval matrix<br/>and graph of deviations from JI triads, and links which<br/>play mp3s of each of the major and minor triads:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ganassi/ganassi.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ganassi/ganassi.htm</a></p><p>Here is a table illustrating the scale, with cents given above<br/>the nominals, and string-length proportions below:</p><p>   0   89  182  281 386 498  597  702  791  884  983 1088   0</p><p>  C  C#/Db  D  D#/Eb  E   F  F#/Gb  G  G#/Ab  A  A#/Bb  B   C</p><p> 120  114  108  102  96  90   85   80   76   72   68   64  60</p><p>  30        27       24            20   19   18   17   16  15<br/>  24                     18   17   16                      12<br/>  20   19   18   17  16  15                  12            10</p><p>So you can see that it is two fully chromatic tetrachords<br/>with the proportions 20:19:18:17:16:15, connected by a<br/>&quot;tone of disjunction&quot; which is divided 18:17:16.</p><p>The cents values show that it is a well-temperament,<br/>giving exact Pythagorean &quot;4ths&quot; and &quot;5ths&quot; and 5-limit JI<br/>&quot;major 2nd/3rd/6th/7ths&quot;.  The &quot;minor&quot; variety of these<br/>intervals are narrower than either Pythagorean or<br/>5-limit, in a few cases suggesting the 7-limit flavor<br/>of &quot;minor 3rd/7th&quot;.</p><p>From the interval matrix I have constructed a table showing<br/>deviation from the &quot;perfect 5th&quot; and from Pythagorean and<br/>5-limit JI &quot;3rds&quot; (and from 7:6), useful in analyzing the<br/>properties of this tuning in relation to &quot;common-practice&quot;<br/>(Eurocentric, c. 1600-1900) triadic harmony.</p><p>Deviations from JI intervals (in cents):</p><p>  &quot;root&quot;  7:6  32:27  6:5  5:4  81:64   3:2</p><p>    B     +27     0   -22  + 7   -15    + 7<br/>  A#/Bb   +39   +11   -10  +13   - 9    +13<br/>    A     +49   +22     0  +18   - 3      0<br/>  G#/Ab   +31   + 3   -18  +23   + 1    -11<br/>    G     +14   -13   -34    0   -22    -22<br/>  F#/Gb   +20   - 7   -28    0   -22    -10<br/>    F     +26   - 1   -23    0   -22      0<br/>    E     +49   +22     0  +18   - 3      0<br/>  D#/Eb   +49   +22     0  +34   +13      0<br/>    D     +49   +22     0  +28   + 7      0<br/>  C#/Db   +31   + 3   -18  +23   + 1      0<br/>    C     +14   -13   -34    0   -22      0</p><p>This table shows that the only &quot;good&quot; triads,<br/>which provide exact proportions of 4:5:6 for &quot;major&quot;<br/>and 1/(4:5:6) for &quot;minor&quot;, are &quot;C&quot; and &quot;F&quot; major, and<br/>&quot;D&quot;, &quot;D#&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; minor.</p><p>Some notes on the rest of the &quot;major&quot; triads:</p><p>&quot;G&quot; major gives a 5:4 &quot;major 3rd&quot; but the 22-cent-flat<br/>&quot;wolf 5th&quot;.  &quot;F#/Gb&quot; major gives a 5:4 &quot;major 3rd&quot; with<br/>a &quot;5th&quot; much closer to 3:2.</p><p>&quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;C#/Db&quot; major all give exact 3:2s for the<br/>&quot;5th&quot; and an extremely close approximation to the 81:64<br/>Pythagorean &quot;major 3rd&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; major is similar but<br/>sounds quite out-of-tune with a slightly higher &quot;3rd&quot;.</p><p>&quot;B&quot; major gives a &quot;major 3rd&quot; and a &quot;5th&quot; that are<br/>both ~7 cents wider than 4:5:6, and &quot;A#/Bb&quot; major gives<br/>deviations of ~13 cents wider for both.</p><p>&quot;D#/Eb&quot; major is similar to &quot;D&quot; major in that it gives<br/>an exact 3:2 &quot;5th&quot; but an even higher &quot;major 3rd&quot;, and<br/>&quot;G#/Ab&quot; major gives a very good approximation to the<br/>Pythagorean &quot;major 3rd&quot; but the &quot;5th&quot; is ~11 cents<br/>narrower than 3:2.</p><p>And for the rest of the &quot;minor&quot; triads:</p><p>Of the remaining 3 &quot;minor&quot; triads which have a perfect<br/>3:2 &quot;5th&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;C#/Db&quot; minor give a good approximation<br/>to the Pythagorean 32:27 &quot;minor 3rd&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; minor gives<br/>a dark narrow &quot;3rd&quot; which is about halfway between the<br/>7:6 and the Pythagorean &quot;minor 3rd&quot;.</p><p>&quot;G&quot; minor has this same low &quot;minor 3rd&quot;, but its &quot;5th&quot;<br/>is the very flat &quot;wolf 5th&quot;.</p><p>&quot;F#/Gb&quot; and &quot;G#/Ab&quot; minor both have decent approximations<br/>to the Pythagorean &quot;minor 3rd&quot; and a &quot;5th&quot; narrower by<br/>~10 and ~11 cents respectively from 3:2, and &quot;B&quot; minor<br/>gives an exact Pythagorean &quot;minor 3rd&quot; with a &quot;5th&quot; that<br/>is ~7 cents wider than 3:2.</p><p>Lastly, &quot;A#/Bb&quot; minor gives almost the same error for<br/>its wide Pythagorean &quot;minor 3rd&quot; and &quot;5th&quot;; its &quot;minor 3rd&quot;<br/>is actually about midway between the Pythagorean and 6:5.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
