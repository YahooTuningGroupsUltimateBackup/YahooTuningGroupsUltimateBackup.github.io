I will try these ideas.  They sound like fun.  My &quot;steel guitar&quot; is a lap type instrument.  It is somewhat like Ivor Darreg&apos;s megalyras.  I made it of lumber yard wood with the simple hand and electric tools.  The string lengths from nut to bridge are 70.5 cm (the same as my homebuilt 6-string mountain dulcimer with moveable wire frets).  The &quot;steel guitar&quot; has previously used piano tuning metal pegs.  This side has 9 guitar strings selected to tune in thirds and other commonly used intervals.  The other side of the board has 5 bass guitar strings 80 cm from nut to bridge also tuned in commonly tuned intervals.  On the board below the strings I put a strip of cardboard with markings to indicate fingering of whatever tuning I want.  The cardboard strips can be for just about any equal tempered and other tunings.  Whenever I change boards I must retune strings to suit the tuning I am using.  Thus this is an unfretted &quot;guitar&quot; that can be played many tunings.  Several years ago I described this instrument and got many comments.  I like to make things out of wood especially when I can make something simple and fun to use.  I don&apos;t want to buy a factory made steel guitar.  However,  I should not make too many things because I end up making and not having time to use them!           Alita Morrison</p></div>
