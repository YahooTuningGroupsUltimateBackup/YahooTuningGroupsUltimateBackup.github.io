One has only to observe that Partch used only 4 of his<br/>pitches in his bottom range. When i used the 22 tone Pascal Eikosany i selected 9 to tune up. It<br/>seems though if one had the choice one would like to have more notes but still i think the<br/>tendency would be to use larger leaps and such in ones lower lines.<br/>Whereas in the upper range one might expect the same tendency. but  since the difference tones in<br/>this case so often fall in our best hearing range, our pitch discrimination is cued in ways unlike<br/>in the bass.</p><p>Mark Gould wrote:</p><p>&gt;  It is interesting that some composers<br/>&gt; (George Benjamin, James Wood) have asked me personally as to why they don&apos;t<br/>&gt; put micro-intervals in the bass.
