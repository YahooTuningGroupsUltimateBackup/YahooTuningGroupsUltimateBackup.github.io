Forget about the e-mails.<br/>Besides, then you have the entire archive and Web links from which to<br/>learn.  The only &quot;downside&quot; is that you are &quot;online&quot; more... but that<br/>will be a &quot;wave&quot; of the future, anyway...<br/>___________ ____ __ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
