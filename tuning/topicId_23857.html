<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Musical practice and discourse about music</h1><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@matavnet.hu&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2001 6:00:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello:</p><p>I&apos;ve been away from the tuning list for a time, but have been told a bit about<br/>the recent proliferation of break-away groups.  This reminds me a bit of the<br/>historical tendency among left wing political parties to split up at the<br/>slightest provocation or perception thereof -- so diluting their strength that<br/>powers was effectively ceded to the conservatives. I was even tempted to step in<br/>and open a new list myself, a moderated &quot;tuning for grown-ups&quot;, with moderation<br/>to insure civility and seriousness.</p><p>However, it seemed to me that it might be more constructive to consider the<br/>problems that have led to this fragmentation. My impression -- and only my<br/>impression -- is that these problems fall into two basic categories, of which<br/>the first category is simple miscommunication (as in: P. writes something in a<br/>passioned but clear bit of rhetorical prose, indicating a position of<br/>enthusiastic agreement with K.; K., however, apparently unfamiliar with the form<br/>of language used by P, interprets P.&apos;s expression of enthusiastic agreement as a<br/>heated critique; result: explosive exchanges of bad feelings).  Having a<br/>moderator is one solution to this problem. Another is a more extensive use of<br/>back channels -- before you fire off your next offensive missive, it can&apos;t hurt<br/>to first just send a direct email and ask &quot;Did you _really_ mean this?&quot;. Another<br/>solution is to seriously evaluate your own skills as a reader and writer: do I<br/>understand what has been posted? will others understand what I have written?  In<br/>all seriousness, I do believe that there are some fine musicians on the list who<br/>are simply not writers.</p><p>I admit to having sent more than my fair share of aggressive postings, and<br/>reading some of the intemperate exchanges in the archives is both plain<br/>embarrassing and a sad signal to the world outside of the list, given the modest<br/>but serious work that gets done here and should be wider known.  (It is<br/>precisely for this reason that I continue to demand the right of the individual<br/>poster to withdraw her or his postings from the archives and from further<br/>circulation.  And this is above and beyond cosmetic issues like typos and<br/>misspellings (after 10 years of practice I have still not mastered the use of a<br/>writing in English on a German-layout keyboard, and such mistakes in my postings<br/>really pain me)).</p><p>The second category of problem is more complicated, and has to do with the<br/>relationship between practicing music and making discourse, words, about music.<br/>Perhaps I am wrong, but it is my assumption that every reader of this list is<br/>passionate and serious about music-making. This assumption holds whether they<br/>themselves produce music on their own or not. Indeed, passionate and serious<br/>people whose relationship to music is limited to listening may well value the<br/>production of music more than those persons who are able also to produce music<br/>(anyone with experience with the musicians&apos; union may recognize this). It is my<br/>further assumption that each individual&apos;s taste and style, indeed their own idea<br/>of the nature, extent, and limits of what &quot;music&quot; is or might be, is not<br/>infringeable. &quot;Music&quot; is such a large realm of possibilities with very few<br/>universals, if any, that it often seems better to speak of plural, &quot;musics&quot; than<br/>of a monolithic construct.  Finally, I assume that the use of words to convey a<br/>composer&apos;s, performer&apos;s, or listener&apos;s experience of music will always fall<br/>short.  For language to aspire to the &quot;condition of music&quot;, I honestly believe<br/>that you must turn to a parallel art form, to poetry, but even then the<br/>vocabulary will inevitably fail, particularly in conveying the way in which<br/>music articulates time. (Inspired by examples like those of Robert Duncan or<br/>Nate Mackey, I have tried myself to make a kind of poetry which responds to<br/>music, but those I trust have assured me that I should stick with music).</p><p>Given these assumptions, how could one possibly use words in a meaningful and<br/>civil way?  I don&apos;t see much promise in a list of &quot;poetry about music&quot;: it would<br/>most likely drown in naive sentiment and vague assertions, and I don&apos;t think<br/>that that shows respect for music. On the other hand, there is a modest place in<br/>the world for words dealing with the nuts and bolts of music-making: how to<br/>notate something, or assign notes to a keyboard, how to remove frets from a<br/>guitar or set up a synthesizer or a FFT program.  And yes, there is a role for<br/>music theory, whether speculative, analytic, or critical.</p><p>Now, most musicians haven&apos;t got the need for a music theory articulated in<br/>public words; they simply make their music and leave the &quot;theory&quot; unarticulated.<br/>However, even the most free of &quot;free-improvisers&quot; performs under an<br/>unarticulated theoretical regime about what is interesting or not interesting,<br/>about what sound to produce next, about how to articulate time. (I&apos;m constantly<br/>struck by how theory-bound -- and thus predictable and identifiable --<br/>performances by &quot;free-improvisers&quot; turn out to be.  Too, some of the most<br/>serious critical theorists today are to be found among the free-improvising<br/>rank-and-file).</p><p>For the minority of us that like our theories in an articulate form, we have<br/>traditions of music theory to respond to, traditions with highly -- and<br/>sometimes not-so highly -- developed vocabularies and structures.  Working as a<br/>theorist, one has to either be able to command these traditions or to be able to<br/>build new theory from the foundations up.  Many, especially composers, like to<br/>take that _sui generis_ path, but it is tricky, not simple, and one has to be<br/>prepared for serious criticism, that may often leave one feeling as if one&apos;s<br/>music or person is also being criticized.</p><p>Music theory also has a tendency to borrow from related fields: maths, physics,<br/>psychophysics, physiology, neurology, psychology, linguistics... Many musicians<br/>are shy or mistrustful of such borrowings. After all, one can make music just<br/>fine without knowing any of these subjects -- why should knowing them be at all<br/>useful?</p><p>Can we first agree to simply dismiss an anti-intellectual argument? Knowledge,<br/>in sufficient quantity and quality, is never a bad thing.  Moreover, it can be a<br/>very practical thing. Knowing a bit about wave lengths sure helps to calculate<br/>microphone placement or to figure out how long a resonator should be. But that&apos;s<br/>basic stuff. One proof (or failure, as the case may be) of the effectiveness of<br/>more sophisticated scientific borrowings or exchanges can be heard every day in<br/>the wide variety of technology through which music is stored and reproduced.<br/>The success of the CD -- or the tragi-comic quality of the mp3 -- recording is<br/>due largely to an entirely practical interaction between musical,<br/>psychophysical, and physical theories.</p><p>It is, however, maths and music that constitute the one pair of terms whose<br/>conjunction can lead to the most bitter disputes.  However, I don&apos;t think that<br/>is  a valid argument to be made against the following assertion: maths are a<br/>most efficient way of dealing with unfathomable quantities of information.  One<br/>way to hear this is to think of the universe of possible tunings as, for all<br/>intents and purposes, infinite, a vector space of unimaginable dimension, but<br/>within this universe of possible tunings, the number of musically interesting<br/>tunings is, essentially, infinitesimally small.  One music theorist in<br/>particular, Ervin Wilson, has continuously struggled with this problem of trying<br/>to locate the infinitesimally small within the infinitely large, and his<br/>techniques -- graphic lattices, combination sets, linear series, series with<br/>modulations and/or permutations, scale trees, etc. -- have been astonisingly<br/>prescient in finding musically useful material.  Perhaps more sophisticated than<br/>his techniques for deriving scales are the techniques he uses to discard<br/>scales -- using random generators, for example, as a kind of monitor against<br/>nonsense. Please note that I have used the qualifier &quot;musically&quot; here without<br/>any definition: I intend none other than Wilson&apos;s own taste and musical<br/>sensibility, for it is precisely here, in an interaction between a talented<br/>musician with astonishing ears and aural imagination and a rigorous method that<br/>the astonishing happens with unreasonable frequency.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Composer,  Budapest/Morro Bay<br/><a href="mailto:djwolf1@matavnet.hu">djwolf1@matavnet.hu</a><br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/27/2001 7:49:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23857">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23857</a></p><p>&gt; Hello:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been away from the tuning list for a time,</p><p>A hearty welcome back to Daniel Wolf, who has been sorely missed on<br/>this list... particularly with respect to his historical knowledge<br/>and his knowledge of practical notation.

Unlike left wing politics membership<br/>in one group does not mean one cannot be members in others.<br/>Instead of being speculative as to what or what not it means, lets look at the result.<br/>1. more and different people are posting<br/>2. more viewpoints are being put forth.<br/> 3. certain lists have enable certain subjects that to be discussed without interference. In<br/>example, the Spiritual Tuning list compared to the Brian&apos;s post on my own involvement in such<br/>subjects on the practical tuning list. It is clear that that list allows things that frankly are<br/>best removed from these list.</p><p>All groups involve a certain conformity to the whole. When that conformity reaches a point that<br/>alienates others , it is natural that they would go elsewhere.</p><p>Let me say as one of the great non-writers on this list, that i had very little to do with the<br/>forming of any of these recent new lists.
