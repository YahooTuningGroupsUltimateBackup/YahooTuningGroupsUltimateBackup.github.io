With<br/>typical neo-Gothic equitones from Pythagorean to 17-tET, the size ranges<br/>from 9:8 to somewhat larger; in 22-tET, the whole-tone of 4/22 octave is<br/>just a bit larger than the mean of 9:8 and 8:7, making the regular ~9:7<br/>major third (~436.36 cents, 8/22 octave) just a tad larger than pure.</p><p>What equitones as a superset share with the narrower set of meantones are<br/>the following main features:</p><p>      (1) The fifth is not too far from 3:2, say between 7-tET and 5-tET<br/>          (Blackwood&apos;s &quot;perfect fifth&quot; generator), with the implication<br/>          of a &quot;recognizable diatonic scale&quot;;</p><p>      (2) Four fifths up less two octaves form some kind of &quot;major third,&quot;<br/>          typically in the general region between ~5:4 and ~9:7; and</p><p>      (3) Two fifths form a &quot;whole-tone&quot; between ~10:9 and ~8:7, actually<br/>          most often in the somewhat narrower range suggested by (2).</p><p>For regular tunings using other kinds of generators, maybe the term<br/>&quot;equistep&quot; would suggest a superset of equitones. The idea might be that<br/>we have a chain of generators, but not necessarily &quot;traditional fifths or<br/>fourths.&quot;</p><p>The term &quot;equistep&quot; might emphasize the idea that a usual kind of diatonic<br/>structure implied by &quot;tone&quot; does not necessarily apply, but that a chain<br/>of identical generators does.</p><p>This is just a first impression, and I&apos;d invite a lot of further<br/>discussion.</p><p>In discussing &quot;meantone&quot; and &quot;equitone,&quot; I should also duly note one<br/>important distinction between the terms. &quot;Meantone,&quot; although apparently<br/>coined sometime after the 16th century if I&apos;m not mistaken (terms like<br/>_participatio_ for &quot;temperament&quot; were common, but I&apos;m not aware of<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; or &quot;mesotonic&quot; so early), carries lots of historical<br/>baggage. This is a very strong argument for not speaking of &quot;neo-Gothic<br/>meantones,&quot; for example, but rather of &quot;neo-Gothic equitones.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, &quot;equitone&quot; is new, and if the term attracts a widespread<br/>usage, the &quot;accepted&quot; meaning may be shaped by that.</p><p>My own inclination might be to suggest &quot;equistep&quot; for the yet larger set<br/>of tunings we&apos;re discussing, but that is again a tentative first response,<br/>maybe more timely than carefully considered.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
