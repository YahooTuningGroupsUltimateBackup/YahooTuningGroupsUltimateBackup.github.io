The basic tone material arranged in ascending order should be termed the<br/>&apos;Gamut&apos;</p><p>2. That the distance between members of a diatonic scale (seven tone or<br/>generalised -as per my own ideas on scale theory) should be described as<br/>seconds, thirds, fourths etc. Major/minor and perfect/augmented and<br/>diminished I&apos;ll come onto later</p><p>3. That the interval through which a pitch is altered (upwards or downwards)<br/>in order to modulate from one key to another (f to f sharp for example)<br/>should be termed a &apos;chroma&apos;</p><p>4. That the distance between adjacent pitch-classes in a gamut should be<br/>called the &apos;Gamut-step&apos;</p><p>5. For a traditional diatonic scale formed from an EDO gamut, the terms<br/>&apos;tone&apos; and &apos;semitone&apos; refer to a &apos;major&apos; and &apos;minor&apos; second respectively.<br/>For some scales the minor second and the chroma are synonyms, but for most<br/>they are not.</p><p>6. THe difference between major and minor intervals (2nds, 3rds, 6ths etc)<br/>is one chroma</p><p>7. The difference between perfect and augmented and perfect and diminished<br/>intervals (4ths and 5ths and 8ves (2/1s)) is one chroma.</p><p>An example will help clarify:</p><p>31EDO, seven tone diatonic</p><p>gamut - the 31 pitch-classes</p><p>heptatonic diatonic as pitch classes with tonic at 0:<br/>0 5 10 13 18 23 28 (0</p><p>Tone - major second = 5 gamut steps<br/>Semitone - minor second = 3 gamut steps<br/>Chroma is therefore 2 gamut steps</p><p>31 EDO, eleven tone diatonic (see my stuff about generalised diatonics PNM<br/>38/2)</p><p>gamut - 31 pitch-classes</p><p>polytonic diatonic as pitch-classes with tonic (proposed) at 0</p><p>0 3 6 9 12 14 17 20 23 26 29</p><p>Tone - major second = 3 gamut steps<br/>semitone - minor second = 2 gamut steps<br/>chroma = 1 gamut step</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>For me, the concepts of tone and semitone and chroma are variable and are<br/>tied to the &apos;diatonic&apos; currently in operation in the music. This I find is<br/>conceptually clearer than making absolute definitions in relation to a<br/>specific EDO, and permits the transferral of terminology from one scale to<br/>another, so long as those scales are related (i.e. they are generalised<br/>diatonics)</p><p>Thus the concept of a &apos;chroma&apos; is allied to &apos;alteration&apos; of a pitch, a<br/>&apos;colouring&apos; whereas the gamut step completely identifies a variable sized<br/>interval dependent upon EDO. Of course there is no objection to using gamut<br/>step in relation to a gamut formed from JI ratios in relation to some given<br/>1/1.</p><p>From the reappearance of the same diatonic scales (of different types, not<br/>just the heptatonic diatonic) in different EDOs, these scales are<br/>independent of the EDO that is used to represent them. Therefore the<br/>&apos;chroma&apos; is more properly defined as being independent of the EDO gamut, but<br/>dependent upon the absolute diatonic it is part of.</p><p>As an aside, part of the coherence problem can neatly be &apos;helped&apos; out by the<br/>use of this technique:</p><p>For 17EDO, the diatonic is</p><p>0 3 6 7 10 13 16.</p><p>Tone = major second = 3 gamut steps<br/>Semitone = minor second = 1 gamut step<br/>chroma = 2 gamut steps</p><p>The chroma is larger than the semitone, which to me implies incoherent<br/>intervals in this scale.
