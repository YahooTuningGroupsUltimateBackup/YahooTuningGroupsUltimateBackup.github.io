Since, as some of our Partch authorities seem<br/>to feel (Jon Szanto, Daniel Wolf, Kraig Grady... certainly Drummond)<br/>that the music shouldn&apos;t be &quot;transcribed&quot; to other instruments, or<br/>electronic ones, certainly part of the theatrical experience can be<br/>preserved and disseminated by electronic means through video, etc.<br/>Could computers and the Internet someday create a &quot;virtual Partch&quot;<br/>experience that could be transmitted worldwide and also preserve much of<br/>the theatre??</p><p>___________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
