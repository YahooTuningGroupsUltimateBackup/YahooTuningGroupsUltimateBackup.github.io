They sounded<br/>okay, and then after playing on the regular player, sounded okay<br/>on that too, no cut off staccato notes.</p><p>Tried a reboot, and it still works okay now.</p><p>Something strange, but perhaps won&apos;t affect many, maybe some kind<br/>of short term bug in my midi player?</p><p>The notes still may not all be sustained for quite as long as they should do,<br/>as a single note off can switch off multiple note offs<br/>for whatever note + channel number it is for, on low to middle<br/>range devices.</p><p>My soundcard does that occasionally, not always.<br/>I.e. switch on midi note 60 for channel 1, do same note again<br/>for same channel, then switch it off once, and both _may_<br/>get switched off, depending. Since as John says, it is a very commonly<br/>used card (and others may do the same thing), it is best to avoid<br/>that situation if one can.</p><p>However, at least the note ons aren&apos;t being treated<br/>as notes offs any more - and at least I&apos;m hearing them all as chords<br/>rather than as single notes with very short staccato extra notes<br/>at the start of the chord.</p><p>I&apos;ve just the moment discovered a .wav recording I did of<br/>them with the idea of possibly sending it on to Margo (if one could<br/>find a way to do so), and true enough, it does<br/>have those funny effects, so it wasn&apos;t just my imagination.</p><p>So, I think conclusion has to be, some kind of short term bug<br/>that has cleared itself up.</p><p>Thanks Margo for sharing these clips with us!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/1/2001 7:56:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;000701c0eaa6$f552f820$84dd68d5@e0b9e6&gt;<br/>Robert wrote:</p><p>&gt; My soundcard does that occasionally, not always.<br/>&gt; I.e. switch on midi note 60 for channel 1, do same note again<br/>&gt; for same channel, then switch it off once, and both _may_<br/>&gt; get switched off, depending.
