I think<br/>the missing sketch of eighthtones Ives mentions in the Memos can be found on<br/>the first sketch page of Section B of the &quot;Universe Symphony.&quot;  It&apos;s found on<br/>a trumpet line (Lou Harrison agrees) and has the markings printed below with<br/>the note below with deviations in cents:</p><p>    5 1/4       2 1/8       6       5 1/4       2 1/8       6<br/>                                                                   &gt;C<br/>    Ab -25      Db      E -25       B -25       Eb -25      Gb</p><p>Joe, I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s fruitful to analyze 24-TET and 48-TET with the same<br/>notation rules for extended Pythagorean.  It seems to be a contradiction in<br/>terms.  They are all part of the smorgasbord that Ives flirts with.</p><p>And yes, there is an overtone machine, as well as a just intonation harp in<br/>the &quot;Universe Symphony.&quot;  There is no doubt about it because he explains it<br/>every which way he can to specify it.</p><p>Lou Harrison took exception to the implication by Ives that one needed an<br/>&quot;Acousticon&quot; in order to accurately play Just Intonation.  Similarly, it is<br/>ironic to me that Lou never imagined woodwind players as reliable microtonal<br/>performers and so he never wrote for them in this regard.</p><p>The actual numbers for Extended Pythagorean with G at 0 cents follow:</p><p>Fb=882      Cb=384      Gb=1086 Db=588      Ab=90</p><p>Eb=792      Bb-294      F=996       C=498       G=0</p><p>D=702       A=204       E=906       B=408       F#=110</p><p>C#=612      G#=114      D#=816      A#=318      E#=1020</p><p>B#=522      FX=24       CX=726      GX=228      DX=930</p><p>AX=432      EX=1134 BX=636</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
