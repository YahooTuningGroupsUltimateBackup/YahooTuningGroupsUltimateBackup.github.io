It is there more to make the next layer<br/>down clearer. In practice, the centered Pentad lattice (with 6 points) with one of the arms<br/>omitted is the best for exploring Pentadic space.</p><p>&gt; So by only drawing some<br/>&gt; of the lines, Erv staves off potentially confusing overlapping lines<br/>&gt; by omitting lines for certain consonant intervals (fully half of them<br/>&gt; in the 5-factor case, and two-thirds of them in the 6-factor case --<br/>&gt; you will see the omitted lines as dotted lines in certain other<br/>&gt; figures in the D&apos;Alessandro paper).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other than that, the orientations of the factors are simply chosen to<br/>&gt; produce pretty, symmetrical shapes in which at least some of the<br/>&gt; important intervallic and chordal relationships can be readily seen.</p><p>If you will notice that on the level with the Eikosany all visible lines will involve the<br/>function of F either harmonically or subharmonically. When using such an object one can place<br/>any factor in the middle which will give the figure a kind of interval &quot;Mode&quot;. There are 144<br/>permutations of which 72 are just a mirror.  It is musically useful and significant in making<br/>certain compositional decisions possible before hand. For instance I could say, I want the<br/>feeling of sevens and place 7 at F. Thus all the ratios in the lattice will be a 7<br/>relationship. It also allows a transformation of material by placing a pattern over different<br/>permutation. It is Erv desire to make structures that are usable by musicians w/o years of<br/>math. The simple transformations of the lattices gives any performer/composer a wealth of<br/>resources</p><p>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
