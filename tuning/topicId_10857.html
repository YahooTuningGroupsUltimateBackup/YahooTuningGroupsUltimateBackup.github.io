I&apos;ve recently downloaded the most current version - 1.6. I am able to use it for analysis, but have been unable to get it to recognize my USB midi port, so that I can transmit the midi to my keyboard - which is supported - the venerable TX81Z. Looks like the 2 midi programs included, do not recognize this kind of port. I also tried to get it to create a .MID file to send with my sequencer - Cake Walk 9.0. Couldn&apos;t get it to work either. Do you know if Scala can &quot;Send/File&quot; as a Sysx format? Perhaps this is what the synth would like to have.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Darren Burgess should be able to help you out with everything here... as<br/>he generously did with me.  It&apos;s really easy.  All you have to do, as he<br/>mentioned, is PLAY the .mid file you make from Scala SEND/FILE at a low<br/>tempo... 16 is recommended, as Darren says.  If you use the map file<br/>LOAD/MAP clinear.kbm you can use &quot;middle C&quot; as your &quot;reference point.&quot;<br/>Of course you are in single mode and press &quot;utility&quot; &quot;Edit Micro Tune.&quot;<br/>Then you go &quot;Edit Full Kbd.&quot; of course.  As Darren mentioned to me, you<br/>see all the numbers run by as the .mid file changes the tuning of the<br/>entire keyboard.</p><p>Then you&apos;re all set to use this with &quot;Performance&quot; mode which, if you<br/>set &quot;ed mictun=full&quot; will mean the &quot;altered&quot; full keyboard scale is<br/>available for any of the voices you set to &quot;on.&quot;  If somehow you don&apos;t<br/>have a manual, you can download one on line as I did... I can find the<br/>address... it&apos;s a Yamaha site.</p><p>This is, as Darren mentioned, all predicated on the fact that you can<br/>actually PLAY simple midi files from your sequencer through your TX81Z.<br/>The Soundblaster cards all have a MIDI OUT port that you can use for<br/>this purpose.  Then, of course, you can switch back and forth between<br/>MIDI files played with the sound card with the AWE 64 MIDI SYNTH and the<br/>TX81Z... in case you want to try out files that have more voices than<br/>the 8 of the TX81Z.  But, of course, you are dealing with altered files<br/>that use &quot;pitch bend&quot; to make the tuning changes, not changing the<br/>internal tuning of the sound card.</p><p>The synth seems like a great &quot;classic&quot; box to me.  Sure, some of the FM<br/>sounds are probably greatly improved upon today, but the tuning<br/>possibilites are amazingly flexible (any pitch in the entire keyboard<br/>can be tuned to ANYTHING-- since any of the set keyboard pitches can<br/>become ANY OTHER pitch in the entire range, and then can be adjusted by<br/>the TX81Z tuning units... The only limitation is the size of the tuning<br/>unit 1.56 cents.</p><p>Actually, the bell sounds in FM boxes, this and others I have &quot;played<br/>with&quot; are extraordinary.  I doubt those have been much &quot;improved upon.&quot;</p><p>Scala + a box like the TX81Z is indeed a powerful, even revolutionary<br/>tool.</p><p>But I suppose you know almost all of what I have described in the<br/>above..., but I enjoy talking about it...</p><p>___________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
