But as I said<br/>then, I actually can (well almost anyway) sympathize with the fact<br/>that to you, they do mean something quite specific...</p><p>Here&apos;s a thought (and I really don&apos;t mean this at all coyly, or<br/>sarcastically); have you considered coming up with two different<br/>variables (that aren&apos;t so generic) for your specific purposes?
