Easily up there with the symmetry of PHI.</p><p>   So I figured I should used it create a scale...not sure if or if not my scale matches Balzano&apos;s or not (it is about 9 tones per 2/1 octave).<br/>  Regardless, one thing is for sure: (sqrt(3) + 1) / 2 is a VERY useful musical ratio.<br/>***********************************************************<br/>  Using the same formula I used for my PHI tuning but substituting (sqrt(3) + 1)/2 for PHI I got the following scale (in cents)</p><p>179.854<br/>299.883<br/>419.911<br/>539.939 = ((sqrt(3) + 1) / 2) = the &quot;pseudo&quot; octave, NOT 2/1</p><p>This scale turns out sounding quite good, as you can hear in the example below:<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/KALLE.wav">http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/KALLE.wav</a></p><p>   Between this example and the one with my PHI scale...it think it should hopefully become more obvious just how much untouched potential lies in using irrational generators (that and octaves other than 2/1).<br/>******************************************************************</p><p>  Now...how many more examples am I going to have to post before some of you JI junkies decide to try your hands (and minds) at making irrational number generated scales?</p><p>   Come on...us very few or so people who believe in irrationals so far can&apos;t do this alone... :-)</p></div>
