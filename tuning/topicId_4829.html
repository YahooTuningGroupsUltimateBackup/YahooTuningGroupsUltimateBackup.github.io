I usually use something like Werckmeister III instead, it&apos;s more<br/>interesting. Mozart doesn&apos;t range into far keys hardly at all, you could<br/>practically get away with mean-tone. Nah, I don&apos;t mean that -- temperament<br/>ordinaire, something that circulates, Rameau or Kirnberger or<br/>Werckmeister. I have all the tables, but they&apos;re available on-line<br/>somewhere or other -- if nobody tells you where and they&apos;re not in the<br/>program, let me know, I&apos;ll send you some numbers.</p><p>Judy</p></div><h3>A440A@aol.com</h3><span>9/14/1999 1:31:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wesley A.

We can look at a<br/>chronological &quot;best guess&quot; as a starting point.<br/>     The Kirnberger III is a good place to begin with Mozart.  There is a<br/>school of thought that holds Mozart to be a Meantone composer.  His keyboard<br/>literature does stay within the bounds one would expect from most of the<br/>meantone tunings.  That said, my own opinion is that Mozart sounds much more<br/>satisfying in a Well Temperament.  The justness of many thirds in the former<br/>is too bland for my 20th century tastes.<br/>     Perhaps it would be most efficient to first compare the Mozart piece<br/>performed on a 1/6 comma meantone and then with a or Kirnberger III.  Once<br/>the decision is made between the Meantone or Circulating, then comparisons<br/>between different examples of the genre would be more productive if you still<br/>want to fine-tune.<br/>    Beethoven Tonality is also a question.  His music holds up beautifully in<br/>all Well Temperaments, and choosing one is really a taste question.  The<br/>Thomas Young temperament of 1799 is a marvel of symmetry, and could easily<br/>have represented the ideal which tuners had pursued for the last century.  As<br/>such, it is a good beginning temperament for Beethoven anything.<br/>     Our recording of the &quot;Pathetique&quot; was done on a Kirnberger, as I wanted<br/>a full syntonic comma to be heard in the 2nd mvt.  The harmony makes use of<br/>the full tempering in this passage in a most unrelenting way.  The Waldstein<br/>had many places where the tuning seemed to clash, so we used a Young on that<br/>and it was just right, (imho).</p><p>Tuners identify temperaments by the following manner.  These are the cents<br/>deviation from ET to create the various well temperaments.<br/>Young<br/>A=    0<br/>A#= +6<br/>B=  -2<br/>C=   +6<br/>C#=  0<br/>D=  +2<br/>D#= +4<br/>E=  -2<br/>F=  +6<br/>F#= -2<br/>G=  +4<br/>G#= +2</p><p>Kirnberger<br/>A =   0<br/>A#=  +8<br/>B  =   0<br/>C  =   +12<br/>C#=  +2<br/>D = +4<br/>D#=  +6<br/>E =  -2<br/>F = +10<br/>F#= +2<br/>G=  +8<br/>G# +4</p><p>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3>Wesley A.

My Pitch Palette software has what<br/>it calls &quot;Kirnberger&apos;s well temperament.&quot; Is this the same as Kirnberger III?<br/>It states, &quot;Johann Philipp Kirnberger&apos;s one-half syntonic comma temperament of<br/>1771. I and V triads are in just intonation.&quot; Pitch Palette defines a scale in<br/>terms of Hertz. It also has a keyboard diagram with a series of fractions. I<br/>have not yet learned enough about tuning jargon to know what they mean,<br/>although I have a few books (it&apos;s just a question of having enough time to<br/>study them.) Another temperament available in the software is &quot;La Monte Young<br/>style.&quot;</p><p>Do you happen to know the composer and conductor Tom Price of Global Music? He<br/>lives in Hendersonville -- it was he that recommended my tuning software which<br/>can be set to any user-definable tuning, historical temperaments or world<br/>scales. (My brother also happens to live in Nashville!)</p><p>Anyway, thank you for your help.</p><p>Sincere regards,<br/>Wes Dyring</p><p>At 04:31 PM 9/14/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>&gt;     The Kirnberger III is a good place to begin with Mozart....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The<br/>&gt;Thomas Young temperament of 1799 is a marvel of symmetry, and could easily<br/>&gt;have represented the ideal which tuners had pursued for the last century.

You pay for this with a<br/>lot of 21.5 cent thirds in the remote keys.  Also, the fifths DA and AE are<br/>each 1/2 syn.comma narrow.  This is a lot of contrast to be found in one<br/>harmonic toolbox,  but there is also beautiful harmony to be found in this<br/>tuning.</p><p>    Jorgensen writes, (and I agree with) &quot;There has never been any<br/>improvement in temperament practises.  Whatever is gained in the direction of<br/>freedom is accompanied by a corresponding loss in tonal contrasts.&quot;  This<br/>allows a wide range of temperaments to be legitimately considered for most<br/>pieces.<br/>    The sign of an overly tempered interval in the art music  of Mozart,<br/>Beethoven, etal. is that the tempering calls attention to itself.  If the<br/>temperament is perfect, that won&apos;t happen, (noted that in ET, nothing will<br/>call attention to itself, but the cost!!!)   The emotional effect of the<br/>music should be heightened, but the commas needn&apos;t be seen unless called for.</p><p>    Of course, to many, these considerations will never be weighed,  because<br/>they are not listening with educated ears.  Thus, they don&apos;t hear the<br/>difference, even if the effects are real and working on them as they can<br/>still be more affected by a well tempered version than an ET one without<br/>knowing that a change in tuning is there.  I have seen this happen and it<br/>gives me the desire to continue crusading.<br/>    Recognizing the effects takes a little practice, but temperament<br/>awareness is a learned skill and the musical public hasn&apos;t yet learned it.  I<br/>also believe that they will not learn it willingly, as it requires effort, no<br/>matter how slight, and for the great unwashed masses out there, the reduction<br/>of effort has a higher priority than the pursuit of beauty.<br/>    Gee, that sounds cynical, but it it what my experience has shown.  I and<br/>others involved in this fin de siecle temperament revival have become used to<br/>having musicians be totally oblivious to what we consider profound,<br/>earth-shaking alterations of 20th century ET.  But we have an obtuse<br/>obsession with this arcane practise, so we continue.<br/>    Ah well,  lemme go see if those angels over there want to do the<br/>Hully-Gully before this pinhead gets more crowded than it is.......
