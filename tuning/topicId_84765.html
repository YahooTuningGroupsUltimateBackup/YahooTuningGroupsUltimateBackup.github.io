On the other hand, microtonally speaking, it<br/>&gt; &gt; would perhaps be possible to work some interesting scales out for<br/>&gt; &gt; dealing specifically with inharmonic timbres... Might make for a<br/>&gt; &gt; smoother ride when listening to a carillon or something. Maybe a<br/>&gt; &gt; nonoctave tuning?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And Charles, if you&apos;re really going to control that many bells, &gt; can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; we just get 5-limit JI in there somewhere?
