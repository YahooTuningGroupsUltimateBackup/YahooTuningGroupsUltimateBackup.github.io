It benefited a lot from that discussion and this is the first release.</p><p>The waveform player specialises in making pure harmonic timbres using maths functions (polynomials, bessel functions, trig functions etc). It&apos;s motivated by the observation that pure harmonic timbres with no inharmonicity at all have exactly repeating waveforms.

Also, you can render the audio directly to a file too, if you want to bypass the digital to audio and back to digital conversions in the soundcard and save the waveform exactly as it was made.</p><p>The menu of example instruments also includes plucked sounds, time varying, and inharmonic sounds as well got by transforming its basic harmonic timbre sounds in various ways.</p><p>You can read about it here:<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/waveform_player.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/waveform_player.htm</a></p><p>The new Out for In devices option lets you retune large orchestral scores, and can be used with GPO - originally for Rick McGowan on his suggestion.</p><p>The CSound capabilities of the program are innovative with the automated CSound orchestra builder. It lets you just choose your  CSound instruments for the sixteen midi channels from a list and choose your desired stereo pan position for each one - and FTS will automatically build a CSound orchestra incorporating them all - something that normally requires a fair amount of recoding and renumbering by hand. It works with any CSound instrument.<br/>It is easy to use - just select the CSound save type, choose the CSound instruments for all the parts of your piece from a drop list - and then record to CSound just as you would do to midi, by pressing a record button.

You have to add an extra section to tell FTS what parameters to expect for your instrument and the type for any frequency or velocity type parameters (CPS, PCH, OCT, MIDI, VEL, AMP or DB) and include any score initialisation statements required such as tables in another section, and normally that&apos;s about it, apart from the rare situations where it has a zakinit line.

It is great to have it finished at last, affer working on 3.0 since the beginning of 2004, so that&apos;s four years of work pretty much full time on FTS most of that time too (more than full time really in terms of hours per week). So a real red letter day!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
