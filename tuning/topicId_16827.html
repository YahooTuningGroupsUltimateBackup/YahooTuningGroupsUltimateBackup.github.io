The<br/>Symposium is organised jointly by the Catgut Acoustical Society (CAS) and<br/>the Interuniversity Center of Acoustics and Musical Research (CIARM) and<br/>will be a satellite symposium of the 17th International Congress on<br/>Acoustics (ICA) to be held in Rome in the first week of september 2001. The<br/>Symposium will be joint with &quot;Perugia Classico&quot;: a noteworthy Italian<br/>exhibition and market of acoustic instruments, which will give musicians,<br/>instruments makers and acousticians the opportunity to meet and discuss any<br/>topic of musical acoustics from an interdisciplinary point of view. The<br/>leading theme of the Symposium will be Musical Sounds from Past Millennia,<br/>which will be accompanied with a leitmotif: The Preservation and Promotion<br/>of our Musical Acoustic Heritage. Through a retrospective overview of<br/>acoustic characteristics of the musical sounds, i.e. sounds that man has<br/>carefully selected in the course of his history for creating music, the<br/>attention will be focused mostly on the issues regarding the need of keeping<br/>this cultural and scientific patrimony alive and available to later<br/>generations. In this frame recent advances in the design of musical<br/>instruments should be related to their tradition.<br/>Within the broad theme of the conference, all the major areas of musical<br/>acoustics will be considered. These will include ordinary as well as special<br/>topics. In particular, special topics of prominent historical and<br/>musicological interest will be structured in the last two days of the<br/>Conference, (joint with &quot;Perugia Classico&quot;). As in the past ISMA<br/>symposia, workshops and free demos are planned for instrument makers,<br/>researchers and students interested in applied aspects of musical<br/>instruments design and construction as well as computer applications used in<br/>musical acoustics. The official language of ISMA2001 will be English.</p><p>Topics<br/>- Perception of musical sound and musical scales<br/>- Architectural acoustics<br/>- String instruments<br/>- Wind instruments<br/>- Percussion instruments<br/>- Pipe organs and singing<br/>- Recording and reproduction of sound<br/>- Electronic musical instruments</p><p>Special Topics<br/>- Perception and microtonality<br/>- Nonlinear phenomena and chaos in musical acoustics<br/>- Physical modeling and sound synthesis<br/>- Acoustical properties of violins and their measurement<br/>- History of musical acoustics and education<br/>- Preservation of musical instruments</p><p>Workshops and demos<br/>- Building of violins and violinmaker&apos;s acoustical analysis<br/>- Wind instruments: building, playing and joining music acoustics to<br/>performance<br/>- Acoustical measurement techniques for wind instruments<br/>- Instruments and gestural control of music</p><p>Deadlines<br/>February 15, 2001 pre-registration and abstracts submission<br/>March 31, 2001 acceptance notices to authors<br/>June 15, 2001 -payment of registration fees<br/>-sending of the registration form and manuscripts for publication</p><p>More details about the Symposium are available at the official site:<br/><a href="http://www.cini.ve.cnr.it">http://www.cini.ve.cnr.it</a> (ISMA 2001), and at the site of the<br/>joint exhibition Perugia Classico: <a href="http://www.perusia.it/classico">http://www.perusia.it/classico</a></p><p>If there are some of the list readers interested in the special session on<br/>perception and microtonality which I am organising,  You can mail me<br/>privately any questions and suggestions. There are also some free space in<br/>the workshops and demos sessions which can include, for example, some topics<br/>on microtonal instruments.</p><p>     With best regards,</p><p>                                                               Diego L.<br/>Gonzalez</p></div>
