mapping?</p><p>this is perhaps a case where it&apos;s of paramount importance<br/>to acknowledge the intended use of a notation, which<br/>is along the lines of what Joe Pehrson and Jon Szanto<br/>have always argued.</p><p>for analysis and score study, certainly a consistent<br/>mapping is preferable, but for performance, quantize<br/>seems to me to be better.  in the case of simultaneous<br/>harmonies, performers only see their part and not any<br/>of the others, so the inconsistencies won&apos;t matter<br/>as much there as they would in the performer&apos;s perception<br/>of the melodic outlines of his own part.</p><p>but in the cases of all three composers whose work i<br/>mentioned as using Johnston&apos;s notation (Johnston, Gann,<br/>Doty), the proper pitches of the melodic outlines would<br/>be clearly perceivable by the supporting harmonies anyway.<br/>their styles are all predicated upon that.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=35520 href="#35520">ðŸ”—</a>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 5:54:08 AM</span><button style="float: right;
