I didn&apos;t mean at all to &apos;warn&apos;<br/>you to participate on the Tuning List. But each time 24tet turns up, I think<br/>about my own situation: 24tet performing was my first experience in<br/>microtonality. While working on some pieces, like Haba&apos;s Suite for guitar, I<br/>gradually got familiar with the sound. Later, when I read Helmholtz and<br/>Partch&apos;s Genesis, I was disappointed to see how little enthusiasm these<br/>authors showed towards 24tet. Mostly, as I understood, for it&apos;s &quot;roughness&quot;:<br/>most intervals are far out of tune since they don&apos;t approximate simple<br/>ratios. Fortunately, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Personally I find 24-tET a fascinating system because it combines<br/>&gt; near-just fifths and slightly subdued major thirds (400 cents, or<br/>&gt; about 8 cents narrower than the usual Pythagorean 81:64) with very<br/>&gt; close approximations of 13:10 (450 cents or 9/24 octave) and 15:13<br/>&gt; (250 cents or 5/24 octave), and also 26:15 (950 cents or 19/24<br/>&gt; octave). The 950-cent interval, for example, can serve as either a<br/>&gt; wide major sixth or a narrow minor seventh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, from a &quot;JI-oriented&quot; point of view, 24-tET has fine<br/>&gt; approximations of 11:9 (350 cents, 7/24 octave) and 11:8 (550 cents,<br/>&gt; 11/24 octave).</p><p>I observed, just as Margo does, that the 950 cents in 24tet falls right in<br/>between 12/7 (933 cents) and 7/4 (969 cents). This knowledge helps me as a<br/>performer. I can slightly push up or down these notes and thus help the ear<br/>a little. This is for me a real valuable link with JI.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
