As one who has composed and played an awful lot of<br/>12tet music, my journey into microtonalism is a stumbling one.</p><p>When I first started working with multiple equal divisions of the<br/>octave, I was very interested in seeing what kinds of compositional<br/>conditions I could create that would<br/>strengthen a sense of navigational similarity. My hope was that this<br/>would thereby cultivate sets of modulatory paths (or structural links)<br/>between a wide variety of equal divisions of the octave.</p><p>Some microtonalist who use multiple equal divisions of the octave, say<br/>Brian McLaren (in the spirit of Ivor Darreg) for example, will attempt<br/>to exploit a specific characteristic sound, or &quot;mood&quot; of whole<br/>families of equal divisions of the octave. A simple example being 5 &amp;<br/>7e, and their respective families, i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc., and<br/>7, 14, 21, 28 &amp; 35 (where the 5 &amp; 7 would meet), etc. For me, it was<br/>the very kinds of &quot;interesting properties by being so readily<br/>divisible&quot; that Robert mentions in his post, that provided the<br/>catalyst for some of the first things I tried out... for as it was<br/>easy enough to see the 2, 3, 4 &amp; 6 in 12, it seemed to me, that by<br/>compositionally stressing the individual structural fingerprints of<br/>the 2, the 3, the 4 and the 6 inside of 12, that it shouldn&apos;t be too<br/>difficult to &apos;see&apos; say the tritones of 8 &amp; 14, or the augmented 9 &amp;<br/>15, or the diminished 20 and the wholetone 30, in 12e... and it was<br/>precisely these sorts of abstracted paths that would give me some<br/>sense of structural direction when modulating between, or<br/>interweaving, say 8, 9, 12, 14 &amp; 15e.</p><p>A lot of what I do here involves processes like mapping the step<br/>structure of certain scales. And most of these create a condition that<br/>clearly favors vertical similarities, and a sense of what could<br/>charitably be called (to paraphrase Daniel Wolf) harmonic rubato<br/>(which more often than not will easily create harmonic distortions of<br/>the sort that most would probably find intolerable)... For example, if<br/>you were to map the familiar 5L 2s diatonic as shown in this periodic<br/>table (where L=s+1, L=s+2, L=s+3, L=s+4, L=s+5, L=s+6, etc.):</p><p>(5)  3   1   6   4   2  (7)<br/>12 (10)  8  13  11   9 (14)<br/>19  17 (15)(20) 18  16 (21)<br/>26  24  22  27 (25) 23 (28)<br/>33  31  29  34  32 (30)(35)</p><p>It&apos;s easy to see the equal divisions in which this 5L 2s mapping will<br/>not work (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 23 &amp; 5, 7, 10, 14, 15,<br/>20, 21, 25, 28, 30, 35), and those in which it will: 12, 17, 19, 22,<br/>24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34 &amp; all &gt;35. But as the differences<br/>between the (quarter comma meantonesque) L=5 &amp; s=3 of 31e, and the<br/>(exaggeratedly Pythagorean-esque) L=3 &amp; s=1 of 17e could obviously be<br/>said to stand worlds apart - it&apos;s really a matter of whether or not<br/>one can find (or create) a musical condition that can utilize their<br/>shared conditions (e.g., L=s+2, etc.), as it&apos;s also not too difficult<br/>to see the thread that runs between them here. Of course in this<br/>sense, it&apos;s then not too much of a leap to say that a generalized<br/>diatonic scale such as Paul Erlich&apos;s 22e decatonic has a brute<br/>representation in 12e (as 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12), and yet<br/>this would no doubt be some sort of near heresy for Paul, as it flies<br/>in the face of most everything that he&apos;s very carefully considered his<br/>scale to accomplish... So perhaps it&apos;s safe to say that most of what I<br/>do technically here is largely dependant on the types of things I<br/>personally do (or some may say: am willing to tolerate) musically....<br/>and that for others, the various things that these types of structural<br/>abstractions share, could well prove to be utterly useless for their<br/>music.</p><p>But for me, they were absolutely indispensable as both specific<br/>exercises, and general concepts... and both (&quot;specific exercises, and<br/>general concepts&quot;) would help me start to acquire some useful<br/>structural strategies, and would furnish the first inklings of where<br/>to start cutting potential paths into that which I already knew I<br/>wanted to accomplish aesthetically (a polyintonational use of the<br/>pitch continuum).</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=5402 href="#5402">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/1999 2:15:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>When I earlier wrote:</p><p>&gt; A lot of what I do here involves processes like mapping the step<br/>structure of certain scales.
