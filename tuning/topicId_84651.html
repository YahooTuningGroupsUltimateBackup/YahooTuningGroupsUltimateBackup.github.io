I&apos;ve been<br/>working on just such a thing. It took me a long time, but progress has<br/>completely stalled, so I&apos;m releasing what I have so far. The logical<br/>choice would have been to do this with some kind of PHP backend, but<br/>my programming stubbornness got the best of me, and I decided it was<br/>absolutely necessary that I do the whole thing using client-side<br/>Javascript and data URI&apos;s. I got about halfway done before I realized<br/>that IE doesn&apos;t support data URI&apos;s. D&apos;oh. So for those of you with<br/>firefox or safari, here it is:</p><p><a href="http://michaelbattagliamusic.com.leaf.arvixe.com/microscalegen/midigenerator.html">http://michaelbattagliamusic.com.leaf.arvixe.com/microscalegen/midigenerator.html</a></p><p>The &quot;<a href="http://michaelbattagliamusic.com.leaf.arvixe.com">michaelbattagliamusic.com.leaf.arvixe.com</a>&quot; domain is temporary<br/>while I get some DNS stuff worked out. I&apos;ll repost the new URL when<br/>it&apos;s up.</p><p>I wanted to come up with a notation that was cross- compatible with<br/>scala SCL format. Consequently, you can copy and past a scala scale<br/>right into the textbox, and it should work provided you leave the<br/>first two checkboxes checked.<br/>   - The &quot;Skip the first two lines&quot; box will do exactly what it says,<br/>as the first line in an SCL file is the name, and the second is the<br/>number of scale degrees it contains, which are useless pieces of<br/>information for our purposes here.<br/>   - The &quot;put 1/1 in as first scale degree&quot; does exactly what it<br/>sounds like. If your scale is 5/4 3/2, a 1/1 will be inserted before<br/>those as the first degree.<br/>   - The &quot;base note&quot; specifies which MIDI note you want 1/1 to be. 60<br/>is middle C.</p><p>But wait! There&apos;s more! I have also included the ability to play more<br/>than one note at once, albeit with no regard for the duration of the<br/>chord. This extension to the scala scale format works as follows: to<br/>play a chord, place all of the entries on the same line within curly<br/>brackets (&quot;{}&quot;), separated by commas. So to play a I IV V I<br/>progression, the input would look something like this:</p><p>{1/1, 5/4, 3/2}<br/>{1/1, 4/3, 5/3}<br/>{9/8, 3/2, 15/8}<br/>{1/2, 3/4, 5/8, 7/8, 9/8, 11/8, 27/16, 17/8}</p><p>At least that&apos;s how -I- like my final I chords to sound. You might<br/>want to uncheck the &quot;skip the first two lines&quot; and &quot;insert 1/1&quot;<br/>checkboxes if you want to treat it as a chord progression sequencer.</p><p>So to a limited extent, we can now express chord ideas progressions<br/>across the web as well as scales, without having to worry about<br/>uploading MP3&apos;s or what not.

I<br/>don&apos;t even want to think about how I&apos;d get OSC working with an app<br/>like this.</p><p>One important bug you should know about for those of you with<br/>Quicktime is that sometimes the first chord doesn&apos;t play back<br/>automatically when the &quot;Go!&quot; button is clicked.
