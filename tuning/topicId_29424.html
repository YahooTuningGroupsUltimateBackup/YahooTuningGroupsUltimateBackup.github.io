I will choose the player who matches what I<br/>want<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; hear in the music and a different ensemble will choose what they<br/>&gt; want.<br/>&gt; &gt; A lot of people have chosen Isaac Stern as well as Britney Spears<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; Milli Vanilli, probably with different criteria than you or I<br/>might<br/>&gt; &gt; use for our auditions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Judging competitions may well be a sham. Although it may be a<br/>&gt; somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt; different process, I&apos;ve been reading articles about the politics<br/>&gt; behind<br/>&gt; &gt; giving prizes to new compositions and how it was ruled for some<br/>&gt; amount<br/>&gt; &gt; of time (maybe still) by 12-tone academia. I don&apos;t see why a<br/>similar<br/>&gt; &gt; situation may not exist in performance competitions where one can<br/>&gt; &gt; use the victor to help promote the style you believe in for<br/>&gt; whatever<br/>&gt; &gt; reason.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As far as &quot;anything goes&quot;, I believe that already exists in the<br/>&gt; arts.<br/>&gt; &gt; I try to keep the attitude &quot;some of it is good for me, some of it<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; good for someone else&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could you justify musical incompetence this way? If musical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; competence<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be defined then perhaps. However, I think competence is<br/>so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; situational<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the needs of the listener/music at hand, that it<br/>ultimately<br/>&gt; comes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down to subjectivity. I work as an engineer, where things are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; provably<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct or incorrect. No such standard exists for music and<br/>&gt; search<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such a standard always leads one on the slope whereby Britney<br/>&gt; Spears<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a greater musician performer than any other kind of music<br/>in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; history of the planet.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On the contrary, Bob, failing to set subjective artistic<br/>&gt; standards<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; leads to a slope where Britney Spears is the greatest musician<br/>on<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; planet, because all you have left is the objective criterion of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; financial success.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>     Howdy:<br/>   As usual in my agitated state, I fired off a piece of pompous<br/>rhetoric and cryptic--at best--humour.
