Kinda brings to mind a<br/>type of call we&apos;d often get at the company I worked for. We were in the<br/>business of designing and constructing adaptive aids for blind folks using,<br/>whenever possible, off-the-shelf stuff so the stuff could be duplicated<br/>without aid of manufacturies.<br/>This guy calls us up and says he&apos;s designed a reading system for the blind<br/>that&apos;s a whole lot easier than Braille cuz it uses only eight dots. We asked<br/>him how his system would be easier since Braille used only six dots. He said<br/>we were wrong, Braille used 12 dots. We informed him that the three of us<br/>tekkies in the lab all read Braille and except for the 8-dot format used<br/>when control characters had to be indicated, we could only count six dots in<br/>a Braille cell. This went on for some time, the only conclusion was that<br/>each side accused the other of not doing his homework.<br/>Not quite sure why that post brought that to my tilted brain, but it did.<br/>Then again...<br/>But while I&apos;m here I&apos;ll say my temporary farewell. We&apos;re moving to Port<br/>Angeles, Washington in a week so I&apos;ll hafta suffer withdrawal for a week or<br/>three.<br/>Glad I found this list. It&apos;s great to be conversing with a buncha bright<br/>people. Thanks so much for all the info so far and the sheer liveliness of<br/>the exchanges.<br/>I&apos;ll still be around til probably Wednesday.<br/>Okay, end of frivolity. Back to serious stuff.</p></div>
