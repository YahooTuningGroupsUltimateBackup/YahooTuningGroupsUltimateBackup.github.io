These are sets of<br/>four tones that each contain all 12 intervals ( by inversion). These are C D F Gb, C Db E F#,<br/>C Db Eb G, C E F# G. These would be of use if you were looking for efficient material. A form<br/>of defining scales you might find interesting is Moments of Symmetry .<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html</a></p><p>Jason_Yust wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m using David Rothenberg&apos;s pitch perception calculus in a thesis I&apos;m<br/>&gt; working on and am having a little difficulty with exactly what property of<br/>&gt; scales the efficiency quantity is meant to capture.  Since some of you seem<br/>&gt; to be pretty familiar with the system, I thought you might have an answer<br/>&gt; to this question.  He introduces the idea of efficiency by saying that an<br/>&gt; efficient musical language is one which can form the greatest number of<br/>&gt; distinct words (ordered sequences of tones) given the number of notes in<br/>&gt; the scale.  The way I interpret this comment is that, for instance, two<br/>&gt; augmented triads, C E G# and D F# A# (both 444), are not distinct words.<br/>&gt; The calculation succeeds at what it is clearly meant to do: distinguish<br/>&gt; asymmetrical proper scales with high stability such as the diatonic scale,<br/>&gt; from symmetrical scales with higher efficiency (although much less common<br/>&gt; in practice) such as the whole tone and octatonic scales.  However, it<br/>&gt; gives the highest efficiency rating to scales which seem intuitively closer<br/>&gt; to symmetrical scales, such as C E F# G# A#.  This scale contains<br/>&gt; indistinct 4 note subsets E F# G# c and G# A# c E (2244), indistinct 3 note<br/>&gt; subsets C E A#, E F# A# and F# G# c (246), subsets E F# c, G# A# e, and A#<br/>&gt; c f#, (264) and so on.  But it is because of this property of the scale<br/>&gt; that it recieves a high efficiency rating (it always takes 5 notes to<br/>&gt; distinguish the scale from one of its transpositions), relative to the<br/>&gt; anhemitonic pentonic, which contains more distinct 2, 3 and 4 note subsets.<br/>&gt;  I must be interpreting &quot;distinct words&quot; incorrectly, in which case the<br/>&gt; question becomes, how should we think of the distinctness of pitch<br/>&gt; sequences as Rothenberg defines it, and what is the value of that way of<br/>&gt; looking at it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jason<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
