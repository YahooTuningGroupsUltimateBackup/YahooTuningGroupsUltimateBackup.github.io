It is the highest honor to attempt, however<br/>imperfectly, to respond to your question embracing aspects of at least<br/>seven centuries of European music.</p><p>Also, as in an earlier post, please let me add with due humility that<br/>people who have actually taught counterpoint, or used textbooks<br/>published in the the last decade or two with which I am less familiar,<br/>may have all kinds of valuable suggestions. Anything I say here should<br/>be read with caution, and not as a substitute for such informed<br/>opinions.</p><p>First, if asked to define counterpoint, I would say that counterpoint<br/>is the art of combining two or more melodic lines so as to form a<br/>beautiful texture where these lines combine in apt vertical intervals<br/>or sonorities and progressions.</p><p>This definition might also apply to the earlier medieval concept of<br/>discant, which Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325) describes as the art of<br/>combining two or more songs so as to produce good concord.</p><p>Since the term &quot;counterpoint&quot; (Latin _contrapunctus_) was apparently<br/>first used around the year 1300, we might say that, strictly speaking,<br/>its practice and theory begin in the early 14th century, the epoch<br/>known as the opening of the _Ars Nova_ or &quot;New Art&quot; (around<br/>1300-1420). Since then, counterpoint has taken form in many styles<br/>ranging from the late Gothic or Ars Nova to the styles of the 16th and<br/>18th centuries often given special academic emphasis to new forms of<br/>&quot;20th-century counterpoint.&quot;</p><p>However, the earlier medieval categories of organum and discant<br/>involve many of the same musical aspects and issues: how to combine<br/>different melodic lines so as to produce a texture which is beautiful<br/>both in terms of vertical intervals or sonorities sounding at the same<br/>time, and in terms of melodic lines and their interplay.</p><p>By the time the term &quot;counterpoint&quot; was introduced around the<br/>beginning of the 14th century, European polyphony (two or more voices<br/>sounding at the same time) had already been practiced for at least<br/>about 400-450 years, with treatises on this topic dating back to<br/>the era of around 850-900 (e.g. _Musica enchiriadis_).</p><p>If we use the terms &quot;discant&quot; and &quot;counterpoint&quot; to refer to music<br/>where a large variety of vertical intervals are used, and there is a<br/>specific interest in maintaining some independence of the voices<br/>(especially through frequent use of contrary motion, with one voice<br/>ascending and the other descending at the same time), then we may be<br/>dealing with about nine centuries of music, say from around the end of<br/>the 11th century to the present.</p><p>If we focus on forms of discant and counterpoint where writing for at<br/>least three simultaneous voices is common (although two-voice writing<br/>continues), then we are dealing with about 800 years of practice and<br/>theory, from the era of the great composer Perotin and his colleagues<br/>around 1200 to the present.</p><p>One problem in discussing European discant and counterpoint is the<br/>variety of eras and styles. Since this is the Tuning List, I&apos;ll<br/>comment about the tuning systems often associated with different eras<br/>or styles:</p><p>    (1) Gothic discant and counterpoint (c. 1200-1420). In this<br/>        music, the basic vertical consonance is the _trine_ with<br/>        a ratio of 2:3:4 (e.g. D3-A3-D4 -- with C4 as middle C,<br/>        and higher numbers showing higher octaves). Pythagorean<br/>        intonation using a wide range of simple and complex<br/>        ratios of 3 is the basis for a very sophisticated range<br/>        of musics often recognizing subtle degrees of concord<br/>        or discord. Octaves, fifths, and fourths are the stable<br/>        concords, but a range of other intervals and sonorities<br/>        are regarded as having some degree of &quot;concord.&quot;</p><p>    (2) Renaissance/Manneristic counterpoint (c. 1420-1650). In<br/>        this era thirds and sixths become the primary concords,<br/>        with the ratio 4:5:6 (e.g. F3-A3-C4) becoming the new<br/>        _harmonia perfetta_ or &quot;perfect harmony,&quot; referred to<br/>        in 1610 and 1612 by Johannes Lippius as a &quot;triad.&quot;<br/>        Just intonation based on pure ratios of 3 and 5, or<br/>        meantone temperament with slightly narrow fifths and<br/>        pure or near-pure thirds, is the ideal. During most<br/>        of this era, all seconds and sevenths are treated<br/>        rather cautiously as &quot;discords,&quot; but around 1600<br/>        they are often used more boldly -- a usual practice<br/>        during the Gothic or Classic/Romantic eras.</p><p>    (3) Early major/minor counterpoint (c. 1650-1750). During<br/>        the earlier part of this era, or at least by around<br/>        the time of Corelli (c. 1680), the modal systems of<br/>        Gothic and Renaissance/Manneristic eras yield more<br/>        and more to the emerging system of major/minor keys.<br/>        While bold dissonances are used as rhetorical or<br/>        poetic effects in early 17th-century modal<br/>        counterpoint, they now serve as structural elements<br/>        defining a key. Bach&apos;s counterpoint, likely based<br/>        on systems of 12-note well-temperament where fifths<br/>        and thirds are tuned in a range of sizes to make<br/>        all keys playable on a 12-note instrument, typifies<br/>        this era at its best.</p><p>    (4) Classic/Romantic counterpoint (c. 1750-1900). In<br/>        this era, with major/minor tonality as the norm,<br/>        composers such as Haydn continue from time to<br/>        time to use subtle counterpoint techniques,<br/>        although other musical approaches and aspects<br/>        are often stressed; around 1850, the theoretical<br/>        norm for tunings shifts from well-temperaments<br/>        toward 12-tone equal temperament (12-tET).</p><p>    (5) 20th-century counterpoint (c. 1900-2000). A<br/>        bit before the year 1900, composers such as<br/>        Debussy introduce new styles of counterpoint<br/>        and harmony, sometimes inspired by medieval<br/>        European practices or by other world musics.<br/>        As in Gothic music, for example, fifths and<br/>        fourths are often favored; at the same time,<br/>        there is often no clear standard of &quot;stability&quot;<br/>        or distinction between &quot;concord/discord&quot; of<br/>        the kind assumed in historical European<br/>        polyphony. While 12-tET remains the &quot;standard&quot;<br/>        keyboard tuning, composers such as Harry Partch,<br/>        and Ivor Darreg explore contrapuntal styles<br/>        associated with extended just intonation or with<br/>        a wide range of equal temperaments (e.g. 13-tET,<br/>        16-tET).</p><p>How one approaches the concept of &quot;discant&quot; or &quot;counterpoint&quot; may<br/>depend on one&apos;s musical background and experience. As someone with a<br/>background mainly in 13th-16th century European styles, I tend to take<br/>a balance between the vertical and horizontal dimensions for granted;<br/>people trained mainly in 18th-19th century styles, where patterns of<br/>key-based harmony may take priority, may view things differently.</p><p>Interestingly, during the era of around 1300-1600, the term<br/>&quot;counterpoint&quot; could sometimes mean specifically a style of setting<br/>two parts in &quot;note-against-note,&quot; moving in the same time values; this<br/>is a literal meaning of _contrapunctus_ or &quot;point against point.&quot;</p><p>However, the term has often come to have almost exactly the opposite<br/>meaning: a &quot;contrapuntal&quot; style is one with melodic lines woven<br/>together and yet each standing out, typically moving in different<br/>rhythmic values or patterns, for example.</p><p>Styles of European discant and counterpoint can vary radically in the<br/>degree to which the succession of vertical intervals or sonorities is<br/>bound by certain more or less strict &quot;rules&quot; (as in 16th-century or<br/>18th-century counterpoint), or is bound by few such categorical rules,<br/>although following certain more or less probable patterns (as in<br/>13th-century discant or 20th-century counterpoint).</p><p>Discant or counterpoint in almost any era is _both_ vertical and<br/>linear: the behavior of melodic lines is guided by certain<br/>progressions between vertical intervals or sonorities, while<br/>progressions between vertical sonorities should involve interesting<br/>melodic lines.</p><p>When people refer to counterpoint as &quot;linear,&quot; they may, for example,<br/>be referring to the absence in Gothic and Renaissance/Manneristic<br/>styles or many 20th-century styles of the restrictions imposed by<br/>major/minor key harmony. However, many of these styles involve other<br/>patterns for establishing a vertical &quot;center&quot; or arranging sectional<br/>cadences in modal or similar schemes, or using tone-rows or serial<br/>techniques, etc., to achieve other kinds of organization.</p><p>In any given era, various stylistic norms combine to shape the<br/>patterns of melodic lines and sonorities, although to one immersed in<br/>a style, these norms may seem quite &quot;natural&quot; and may often go<br/>unspoken. For example, in 13th-century discant, the voices while often<br/>following different rhythmic patterns (e.g. a slow lowest part, faster<br/>middle part, and highly ornamented upper part) typically converge<br/>frequently on complete 2:3:4 trines. Similarly, in the 16th century,<br/>interweaving voices often converge on 4:5:6 sonorities. Theorists of<br/>both eras discuss complete or &quot;perfect&quot; sonority as one ideal, and at<br/>the same time emphasize the diversity of the voices making up the<br/>texture.</p><p>While the concept of &quot;discant&quot; or &quot;counterpoint&quot; typically implies an<br/>interest in independence of the voices, this ideal can lead in<br/>different eras to different practices and rules. Thus parallel fifths<br/>and octaves are common in 13th-14th century and 20th-century writing,<br/>but mostly avoided during the centuries between, although with some<br/>interesting exceptions.</p><p>For whatever reasons, 16th-century and 18th-century counterpoint, with<br/>Palestrina, Lasso, and Victoria as common models for the first period<br/>and Bach for the second, are the most usual topics for academic<br/>study.</p><p>Gothic discant and counterpoint, my own special interest, have tended<br/>to get less attention, although like 20th-century counterpoint they<br/>often involve an approach recognizing several degrees of<br/>&quot;concord/discord&quot; and imposing few absolute rules. Composers such as<br/>Perotin, Adam de la Halle, Petrus de Cruce, Philippe de Vitry,<br/>Guillaume de Machaut, Francesco Landini, and Johannes Ciconia<br/>masterfully explore some of the possibilities of these styles.</p><p>Also, while &quot;Renaissance counterpoint&quot; tends to focus on the 16th<br/>century, and specifically its later part, the 15th-century<br/>counterpoint of composers such as Dufay (a kind of transitional figure<br/>between Gothic and Renaissance) and Ockeghem deserves much more<br/>emphasis.</p><p>The late modal counterpoint of the era around 1600, the age of<br/>Monteverdi and Frescobaldi, deserves more attention also: various<br/>kinds of dissonances are freely used without the later constraints of<br/>major/minor tonality.</p><p>In each era, some styles are more &quot;contrapuntal&quot; than others in the<br/>sense of rhythmically distinguished voices. Thus in the music of Adam<br/>de la Halle around 1280, we find three-voice French songs with simple<br/>vertical progressions suggesting for some scholars a style of<br/>accompanied song, as well as more intricate textures. This contrast<br/>also holds around 1400 or 1550, as well as in the simpler four-voice<br/>chorales and more complex fugues of Bach around 1725. However, even<br/>note-against-note textures may show much &quot;contrapuntal&quot; artistry in<br/>the way that each melodic line is shaped.</p><p>Haresh, one possible disadvantage of sharing all this history is that<br/>the choice of eras and styles may complicate the decision of where to<br/>begin in studying such a diverse topic.</p><p>One approach would be to start with one of the more familiar periods,<br/>and as people have discussed, either the 16th century or the 18th<br/>century has produced much literature both from these periods and by<br/>more modern authors.</p><p>If I may say so, Graham Breed has in a recent post suggested one<br/>method I consider very important: reading a 16th-century theorist such<br/>as Nicola Vicentino, whose treatise _Ancient Music Adapted to Modern<br/>Practice_ addresses not only some basic rules of counterpoint,<br/>intervals, and sonority, but also chromatic and enharmonic techniques<br/>and topics related to intonation of great interest to this List.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to say that I&apos;d recommend Vicentino as the _only_ book for<br/>someone seeking to learn 16th-century counterpoint, but this book plus<br/>a modern textbook or two might be a nice place to begin -- together<br/>with lots of exposure to actual 16th-century music, of course.</p><p>With Joe Monzo I much agree that Fux&apos;s 18th-century _Gradus ad<br/>Parnassum_ is a beautiful piece of literature in its own right as well<br/>as a step-by-step approach to a style inspired by that of Palestrina<br/>in the later 16th century. Certainly it is one possible place to<br/>begin also.</p><p>Again, I realize that much of what I say may raise more questions, and<br/>warmly invite such questions, which may best promote learning.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/31/2001 8:12:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

Of course, that doesn&apos;t mean that<br/>the composition has no vertical organization!  As Ms. Schulter<br/>mentions, there are many organizational means associated with such<br/>counterpoint, and the vertical instances DO matter.</p><p>Regarding more &quot;experimental&quot; forms, like &quot;free&quot; jazz, which also<br/>could quite possibly be considered &quot;contrapuntal,&quot; perhaps in some<br/>instances harmonies are INCIDENTAL to the overall &quot;linear&quot; or<br/>&quot;horizontal&quot; thrust.  I have the feeling that in a jazz master such<br/>as Ornette Coleman, some of the harmony is a bit accidental, although<br/>he has an elaborate system for classifying it.  That is not,<br/>necessarily, as disparagement.  Perhaps some kinds of music just<br/>emphasize &quot;linearity&quot; or horizontal composition over the vertical.</p><p>It might also be said that, in some such kinds of music,<br/>serendipitous VERTICAL occurrences could be great discoveries,<br/>although some of them might be produced by &quot;chance.&quot;  Perhaps it<br/>could be a bit like an experiment in a laboratory, where a scientist<br/>sets out to prove some theorm and then, accidently, discovers<br/>something even more wonderous.</p><p>So my point is that, basically, such fortuitous harmonic discoveries<br/>throught &quot;linear&quot; counterpoint perhaps should not be discounted as<br/>&quot;haphazard&quot; in all instances, particularly in the &quot;hands&quot; of a<br/>talented composer or performer.  Sometimes things of great value can<br/>be produced.  Of course, in more &quot;formalized&quot; composition, generally<br/>there are describable organizational procedures for vertical<br/>occurrences, as mentioned by Ms. Schulter.</p><p>________ ______ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2001 12:42:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;M.

I think the original post of this thread was a request by someone for info on<br/>sources to help with polyphonic and contrapuntal composition. So here&apos;s my little<br/>unisonvectorsworth.<br/>I would thoroughly recommend a book and workbook set called &apos;Music and the Middle Ages - Style and<br/>Structure&apos; by Fenwick-Wilson. I don&apos;t have his first name ( could be Roger ) because I don&apos;t have<br/>the book - instead I spent a few months copying it out. It is out of print but can be had from<br/>Amazon because after a few weeks search they found a copy for me which I declined.</p><p>Anyway, it is a challenging read but is extremely thorough covering styles and structure of all<br/>forms of chant, the Divine Offices, Modal Theory, Early Polyphony (Organum), The Sacred Music of<br/>Southern France, Composition in the Florid Style, Sacred Music in Paris, several separate chapters<br/>on the various strands of Motet and chapters on the Polyphonic Song of France and Italy. The<br/>workbook has copious examples, edited to the highest standards, but best of all there are detailed<br/>assignments on virtually all the aforementioned styles. I found these to be of great value and<br/>totally relevant to contemporary microtonal composition, particularly in my primary field of<br/>choral writing, both mono- and polyphonic.</p><p>Arvo Part, who describes his music as abstract tonalism, took several years out to study the works<br/>and techniques of Machaut, Josquin, Obrecht and Ockeghem, the last three admittedly later than the<br/>period I&apos;m discussing. His music relies largely on techniques such as structured chant, isorhythm<br/>( still a lot to be gleaned here) and organum developments with highly regulated voice exchange.<br/>He might have read this one book, listened to a lot of the music of the period (plenty around) and<br/>considered himself well enough informed to make a start at original composition. This is to my way<br/>of thinking thoroughly contemporary. A lot, perhaps too much, has been said in the musical<br/>language of the common practice tonal period and not enough has been said in the language of<br/>Machaut and company. And I haven&apos;t even started on cadential techniques.</p><p>Which brings me to agree that the counterpoint of Dufay and Ockeghem deserves much more emphasis.<br/>With these, and Josquin and Obrecht, we have reached a pinnacle of excellence that new<br/>JI/microtonal composers could look to for inspiration. For example many of the scales that crop up<br/>in discussions are unsuitable for modulation to several key centres. So why not look to music that<br/>doesn&apos;t modulate much if at all for ideas? And if you must have polyphony, and counterpoint within<br/>that polyphony, I would suggest a few weeks working with parallel, composite parallel, oblique and<br/>free organum liberally spiced with displacement techniques. ( I&apos;m not being obscure, just trying<br/>to arouse curiosity). As long as your lattice gives you some consonant structures good music can<br/>be carved out.</p><p>There&apos;s always something new around the corner.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2001 4:04:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison!<br/>    I can&apos;t help but mention one of my favorites Adrian Willaert.<br/>    I have been looking/listening to Landini mainly because I stumbled across an old complete works<br/>book from the 30&apos;s and found a recording .
