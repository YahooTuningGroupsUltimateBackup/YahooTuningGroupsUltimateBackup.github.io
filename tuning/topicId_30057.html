He explains that sharps and flats are not<br/>&gt;the same and that sharps are lower: C (ces) is lower than D (d&eacute;b).<br/>&gt;He doesn&apos;t say which comma he means, the syntonic or Pythagorean<br/>&gt;comma. This doesn&apos;t matter much since they are almost the same, and<br/>&gt;at that time the distinction was often not made. So ces is four<br/>&gt;commas higher than C and cex four commas higher than ces, etc. On<br/>&gt;page 272 he states that the whole tones stride in equal pace, so<br/>&gt;they are all 9 commas wide. What he doesn&apos;t specify unfortunately is<br/>&gt;the size of the diatonic semitone (distance of E to F and B to C).<br/>&gt;Is it equal in size to the chromatic semitone, 4 commas or a comma<br/>&gt;larger, 5 commas?</p><p>Manuel, the diatonic semitone is equal to the whole tone minus the<br/>chromatic semitone, by definition. So it&apos;s 5 commas -- no ambiguity<br/>whatsoever.</p><p>&gt;The former possibility leads to a system comparable to 53-tone equal<br/>&gt;temperament in that the tones of his system form a subset of 53-tET<br/>&gt;or something close to it. In 53-tET, there are 9 steps in the whole<br/>&gt;tone and 4 in the diatonic semitone: 5&times;9+2&times;4=53 and the fifth is<br/>&gt;virtually pure.</p><p>Manuel, Telemann&apos;s description is clearly not compatible with 53-tET,<br/>since the chromatic semitone is 5, not 4, in 53-tET.</p><p>&gt;So I think we should be cautious to consider Telemann&apos;s system as a<br/>&gt;rigid prescription of a 55-tone equal tempered basic scale.</p><p>Right -- it could be any tuning with fifths averaging approximately<br/>698 cents.</p><p>Looking at the table on page 267 we see 7&times;6+2=44 different names.</p><p>Aha -- I didn&apos;t notice that he had left 5 blanks before!</p><p>&gt;Telemann says nothing about any equivalences between the tones of<br/>&gt;his system. Putting them in ascending order using the 55-tET step as<br/>&gt;the comma indeed gives no enharmonic equivalences. All the tones<br/>&gt;belong to one long cycle of 43 tempered fifths, 22 from C in the<br/>&gt;downward direction and 21 in the upward direction.</p><p>Whoa -- well that&apos;s an important finding, Manuel! This certainly<br/>gives further evidence that the tuning is generated as a chain of<br/>(tempered) fifths, and not conceived in some non-meantone way that we<br/>haven&apos;t thought to consider.</p><p>P.S. A correction: There is no real evidence that Mozart intended 1/6-<br/>comma meantone rather than 1/5-comma or some other meantone system.<br/>It wouldn&apos;t make much sense for one to be that specific in regard to<br/>Mozart anyway, since he clearly assumes enharmonic equivalence even<br/>in a few passages for strings unaccompanied by keyboard, which<br/>violates his known violin teaching altogether.</p></div><h3><a id=30091 href="#30091">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2000 10:27:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Paul Erlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, November 09, 2001 5:44 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: New Telemann page<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/telemann.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/telemann.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So I think we should be cautious to consider Telemann&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; system as a rigid prescription of a 55-tone equal tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; basic scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right -- it could be any tuning with fifths averaging<br/>&gt; approximately 698 cents.</p><p>At the bottom of page 269, Telemann clearly explains in a<br/>musical illustration the following:</p><p>    1   3    1  4  4      =  number of commas between pitches<br/>  C  Dbb  C#  Db  D  D#</p><p>The 12-EDO &quot;5th&quot; size of 700 cents of course provides only<br/>one semitone-sized step between chromatic pitches, so Telemann&apos;s<br/>&quot;5th&quot; must be narrower than this.</p><p>The 55-EDO &quot;5th&quot; size of ~698.1818182 cents is the only one<br/>which gives exactly equal step sizes which fit Telemann&apos;s<br/>descriptions.</p><p>At the 43-EDO &quot;5th&quot; size of ~697.6744186 cents (= 2^(25/43) ),<br/>there are no longer 4 commas between chromatic pitches but<br/>only 3.</p><p>The 31-EDO &quot;5th&quot; size of ~696.7741935 cents (= 2^(18/31) )<br/>provides only 2 steps between chromatic pitches.</p><p>Depending on how far one takes the cycles, various sizes of &quot;5th&quot;<br/>less than 700 and greater than ~696.7741935 cents, except the<br/>one of 43-EDO, will give 4 commas per chromatic semitone.<br/>Between 43- and 31-EDO, the pitches at the more extreme ends<br/>of the cycle switch position (bbb become higher than ###, etc.).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Telemann says nothing about any equivalences between the tones of<br/>&gt; &gt; his system.

I<br/>&gt; am interested in the truth for Bach because it adds new dimensions<br/>to this<br/>&gt; icon of music, and his performance aesthetic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>Hi, Johnny! Nice to hear from you. Been awhile. I suspected that this<br/>might flush you out, although I was sincere in my &quot;nice try&quot;<br/>(giggle). I truly don&apos;t think I&apos;m guilty of &quot;confusing&quot; Bach with<br/>Mozart or Telemann. I do think he ranks far above them, even above<br/>Wolfgang Amadeus, and that&apos;s saying a lot.</p><p>It is clear that I am in some sense generalizing when I imply that<br/>Leopold Mozart&apos;s apparent inconsistency might apply to Bach as well<br/>as to everyone else. However, in my defense, I do not believe this to<br/>to be an entirely rash or unthinking generalization, but rather that<br/>it approaches something like what people mean when they talk about<br/>common<br/>sense.</p><p>In that regard, no one ever addressed a necessarily well-prefaced<br/>question I posed quite some time ago in a post, but liberally<br/>paraphrased here (since I don&apos;t feel like bothering to look it up):</p><p>I still have the impression that Bach wrote the Well-Tempered Clavier<br/>to showcase the special properties of the Werckmeister temperament he<br/>favored. His two- and three-part inventions never venture into the<br/>remote keys that this work does. Instead the key signatures look<br/>suspiciously like they accomodate some kind of regular, open meantone<br/>temperament.</p><p>Admittedly, he could have done this out of deference to tuning<br/>practice in the wider musical world around him, but I wonder why<br/>you&apos;re so adamant about the exclusivity of his commitment to<br/>Werckmeister? Your book will likely explain this in detail, but I<br/>hope you&apos;ll forgive my impatience.</p><p>Incidentally, I&apos;m quite sure that Bach would have written much that<br/>exploits in exquisite detail the nature of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>temperament. This, however, does not constitute a convincing argument<br/>for its exclusive use by Bach, especially in non-keyboard contexts.<br/>Yes, you may be able to point out some of his non-keyboard music with<br/>characteristics that sound idiomatic to Werckmeister. Nonetheless,<br/>could not certain compositional habits sneak into it from having<br/>composed so much with Werckmeister in mind?</p><p>I do not feel that this conjecture somehow demeans Bach&apos;s abilities,<br/>in case you wish to argue that. He was human and subject to subtle<br/>musical habits that reflected in his style, and I don&apos;t see how that<br/>would denigrate his genius in any way whatsoever.</p></div><h3><a id=30135 href="#30135">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>11/13/2001 1:59:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/13/01 4:36:49 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:BobWendell@technet-inc.com">BobWendell@technet-inc.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Incidentally, I&apos;m quite sure that Bach would have written much that<br/>&gt; exploits in exquisite detail the nature of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>&gt;</p><p>I just found a copy of &quot;Bach Werke Verzichnis&quot; in paperback in Amsterdam.
