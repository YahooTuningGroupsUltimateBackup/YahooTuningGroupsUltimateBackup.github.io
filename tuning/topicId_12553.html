They are also, interestingly, the first authors I am aware of who<br/>specifically give what might be termed the rule of 5-limit &quot;stable<br/>saturation&quot; -- wherever possible, use a complete sonority with the<br/>third plus the fifth or sixth above the bass. This complete sonority<br/>is Zarlino&apos;s _harmonia perfetta_, and latter (1610, 1612) the _trias<br/>harmonica_ or triad of Lippius.</p><p>However, the distinction between the two usual 3-limit or Pythagorean<br/>thirds is basic in medieval polyphony, and these intervals are treated<br/>in ways at once distinct but related.</p><p>In Guido, the unstable semiditone (m3) and ditone (M3) and also the<br/>tone (M2, 9:8) are permissible intervals in his free diaphony or<br/>organum along with the stable unison and fourth. He makes the<br/>distinction that in _occursus_ or the &quot;coming together&quot; of the voices<br/>in a cadence to the unison, a third contracting to a unison should be<br/>a ditone (major), not a semiditone (minor). Interestingly, by around<br/>1300, the opposite preference is becoming a standard rule and a<br/>motivation for accidental inflections (written or left to the<br/>performers).</p><p>As often happens, the subtle 13th-14th century continuum of<br/>concord/discord in Continental Europe can easily be distorted if we<br/>try to describe the 3-limit thirds simply as either &quot;concords&quot; or<br/>&quot;discords.&quot; They are unstable &quot;semi-concords,&quot; or in the terminology<br/>such theorists as Johannes de Garlandia and Franco of Cologne,<br/>&quot;imperfect concords,&quot; at once relatively blending but somewhat tense.<br/>Their complex ratios very much fit this role.</p><p>Major and minor thirds -- whether called semiditone and ditone, or<br/>&quot;thirds&quot; -- are classed together as &quot;imperfect concords&quot; of this<br/>kind. They invite resolutions to a unison or fifth, and are often used<br/>more freely also. For much more on this, see</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>In discussing multi-voice sonorities, Jacobus describes the common<br/>_quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; where an outer 3:2 fifth is &quot;split&quot;<br/>by a third middle voice into a major third below and minor third<br/>above (e.g. F3-A3-C3 or f-a-c&apos;) or the converse (e.g. A3-C3-E3 or<br/>a-c&apos;-e&apos;). He prefers the first arrangement, but cites a motet<br/>(transmitted to us in the Montpellier and Bamberg Codices) where the<br/>second variation with the minor below appears as the opening<br/>sonority.</p><p>Jacobus speaks of _tertia in ditono_ and _tertia in semiditono_ to<br/>distinguish these two forms of thirds, classes them like Garlandia and<br/>Franco as the mildest unstable intervals (adding a few others beyond<br/>the octave), and also notes a distinction absolutely vital to late<br/>medieval practice and theory.</p><p>By around 1300, there is a tendency to favor specifically the minor<br/>third before a unison, and the major third before a fifth. These<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; progressions involve contrary motion with one voice<br/>moving by a 9:8 whole-tone, and the other by a concise 256:243<br/>semitone (~90.22 cents).</p><p>This is basic 14th-century theory and practice, and accidentals are<br/>regularly used to make thirds minor before unisons and major before<br/>fifths -- and likewise sixths major before octaves.</p><p>The polarity of a contractive 32:27 and an expansive 81:64 (and<br/>27:16), vital but distinct from later 5-limit distinctions regarding<br/>5:4 and 6:5 as stable concords with different affective qualities,<br/>leads to an interesting terminology for these thirds used by some<br/>theorists.</p><p>The 32:27 is sometimes called an &quot;imperfect third&quot; (_tertia<br/>imperfecta_) which tends to contract to a unison. The 81:64 is<br/>likewise a &quot;perfect third,&quot; with an expansive quality seeking its<br/>&quot;perfection&quot; in the fifth.</p><p>Thus as Italian theorists say, and other theorists agree, a naturally<br/>minor third expanding to a fifth should be &quot;perfected&quot; by an<br/>accidental inflection making it &quot;perfect&quot; or major. Likewise a<br/>naturally major third contracting to a unison should be &quot;colored&quot; by<br/>an inflection making it minor. Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1435) describes<br/>a 17-note octave (Gb-A#) which could be applied to organs so that the<br/>organist could &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;color&quot; these intervals on the various<br/>degrees of the gamut with ideal intonation.</p><p>As the Monz has noted, these inflections involving accidentals other<br/>than the traditional Bb are termed _musica ficta_ (literally &quot;feigned&quot;<br/>or &quot;invented&quot; music -- as opposed to the regular gamut).</p><p>Marchettus of Padua (1318), in my view, exemplifies this basic 3-limit<br/>perspective on cadential dynamics and &quot;closest approach,&quot; and in my<br/>reading and that of some others seeks indeed to accentuate it by<br/>making cadential semitones even narrower than in Pythagorean (and thus<br/>major thirds and sixths wider).</p><p>Interestingly, he refers to thirds (and sixths) as &quot;tolerable<br/>dissonances,&quot; while earlier and contemporary French theorists speak of<br/>&quot;imperfect concords&quot; -- likely a mainly semantic distinction, like<br/>describing a glass of water as half-empty or half-full.</p><p>He suggests the use of a sign like the modern sharp, rather than the<br/>traditional &quot;square-B&quot; or &quot;mi&quot; sign (like the modern natural), to show<br/>an accidental inflection to obtain a major third before a fifth or a<br/>major sixth before an octave. This special &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; marked<br/>by the sharp leaves an extra-small cadential &quot;diesis&quot; which he<br/>suggests is considerably smaller than the usual mi-fa semitone (E-F,<br/>B-C), which is in term smaller than the usual apotome (e.g. Bb-B, or<br/>as Germans would say, B-H).</p><p>However we interpret what might called this &quot;microtonal notation,&quot; his<br/>aesthetics seem to me clearly 3-limit, realized by more conventional<br/>theorists within the usual Pythagorean system.</p><p>During the 15th century, there is a gradual shift from a complex<br/>3-limit to a new 5-limit perspective -- something happening in certain<br/>English styles earlier, at least in terms of the use of thirds as<br/>stable concords.</p><p>Interestingly, the 3-limit &quot;closest approach&quot; progressions involving<br/>the two thirds (and sixths) continue to play an important role in<br/>early 5-limit practice and theory, just as modern jazz may combine<br/>some traditional 18th-19th century harmonic progressions with a new<br/>approach to sonorities.</p><p>It&apos;s fascinating that two theorists interested in fine distinctions of<br/>intonation -- Marchettus in a 3-limit setting, and Vicentino in a<br/>5-limit setting -- should have both discussed the contrast between the<br/>two thirds, whether viewed as &quot;tolerable dissonances&quot; or as primary<br/>concords.</p><p>To sum up, a distinction between the two 3-limit thirds as vertical<br/>intervals goes back to Guido (c. 1030), and the vital distinction of<br/>m3-1 and M3-5 (&quot;closest approach&quot;) to around 1300 (with some<br/>tendencies toward this pattern in the late 13th century).</p><p>However, a fully developed distinction between the qualities of<br/>5-limit major and minor thirds, and between the stable sonorities with<br/>the major third below the minor or vice versa, goes back to around<br/>Vicentino and Zarlino -- although as early as 1523 and 1529, for<br/>example, Pietro Aaron notes a preference for the major third or tenth<br/>at certain points, and in 1525 or so shows cadences in modes such as D<br/>Dorian or E Phrygian with the final third raised.</p><p>Note that this latter distinction applies to the fluid modality of the<br/>middle 16th to early 17th centuries, as well as later major/minor<br/>tonality.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
