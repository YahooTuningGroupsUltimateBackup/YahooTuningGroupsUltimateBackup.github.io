I should add, though, that<br/>at present even *this* implementation is not full, since one needs to<br/>use a &quot;plug in&quot; in order to realize the appropriate pitch bends for<br/>playback.  So, that&apos;s an extra step, and not yet part of the<br/>program.  One of my objectives has been to get the Sibelius people to<br/>*at least* fully implement quartertones, and they may be close to<br/>that in the next issue of the software.  Most probably this would be<br/>the next thing they would do, although they have mentioned to me that<br/>they have the Ezra Sims 72-tET symbols on their list of &quot;possible&quot;<br/>future features.</p><p>Please keep in mind, though, that that&apos;s an incredibly *extensive*<br/>list, and I can assure you that microtonalists are only a small<br/>segment of their user base.</p><p>In addition to these &quot;built in&quot; features, it *is* possible to assign<br/>pitch bends *manually* to any symbol in Sibelius.  For example, I can<br/>use the Ted Mook symbols for 72-equal, which are in postscript, and<br/>import them in as *symbols*, the particular term in Sibelius for a<br/>bunch of such items that can be added to a score.</p><p>Regrettably, such &quot;symbols&quot; cannot be assigned pitch bends.  I am<br/>told this can be done in Finale, but by a rather circuitous and<br/>cumbersome route.</p><p>HOWEVER, it *is* possible to *type in* the pitch bends over each<br/>note, and get the correct intonation.  This is how I realize the<br/>quartertones, sixth tones and 12-th tones in Sibelius.  It *does*<br/>work.  Occasionally things get a little &quot;funky&quot; for one mysterious<br/>reason or another, but on the overall it *does* work, and it *is*<br/>possible to composer in 72-equal with Sibelius, or, actually, in any<br/>other system.  Please keep in mind, though, that since the pitch<br/>bends work on a *channel* basis, it is not possible to use chords on<br/>one stave that have more than one bend simultaneously!  In other<br/>words, if *all* the notes bend up by 1/6th of a whole tone, etc.,<br/>you&apos;re OK, but if they differ they have to be in different staves in<br/>simultaneities, since each *staff* is a different channel.</p><p>Now, there are also some microtonalists who have created *other* more<br/>extensive plug-ins for Sibelius and I think, Gene, you would be<br/>particularly interested in those.</p><p>There is a guy by the name of Pete Walton who has created<br/>a &quot;temperaments plug in&quot; for Sibelius.  Basically he uses the 9<br/>principal accidentals for every &quot;white note&quot; pitch, say Dbb, Db, D#,<br/>D##, D 3-quartertone flat, D quartertone flat, D quartertone sharp, D<br/>three quartertones sharp, well, and D natural, which makes 9:</p><p>And, using the plug-in, you can automatically *assign* any pitch<br/>bends to these existing accidentals, so you can create temperaments<br/>such as 19-equal and 31-equal etc., all the way up to 9*7 (the<br/>nominals) = 63-tET...</p><p>That means, of course, 72-tET can&apos;t be done that way.</p><p>Quite frankly, since the resulting notation is so different from<br/>our &quot;traditional&quot; usage... i.e. even the *natural* notes would have a<br/>different pitch from the *normal* using the temperaments plug in, I,<br/>frankly find it confusing.</p><p>It might be usable, however, for some people with a more theoretical<br/>mindset, and who are willing to veer that far from 12-tET.</p><p>For *me* thought, I would much rather use the Sims, symbols and put<br/>the pitch bends in *manually* for 72-tET.  It only takes a second to<br/>put a pitch bend in manually.</p><p>From the discussions I have read, it seems that the microtonal<br/>implementation of Finale is more robust, and it *is* possible to<br/>assign pitch bends to symbols.  This is something that David Doty has<br/>been talking about quite a bit...</p><p>However, people also seem to feel that, on the overall, Sibelius is a<br/>much more *intuitive* program to use, and the user interface, in<br/>general is better designed.  The general opinion of many users of<br/>both programs is that Sibelius is, on the overall, a better designed<br/>and newer program that is still in it&apos;s infancy, and as it develops<br/>it will gain the depth of some of Finale&apos;s more detailed features.</p><p>Since I haven&apos;t used Finale, I will leave it to a user to explain the<br/>micro possibilites of that package...</p><p>J.

For instance if you bend a note using a pitch bend<br/>wheel on a keyboard, the pitch bend has to retune notes<br/>already in play as well as ones that get played later because that<br/>is the only way it will be able to slowly &quot;bend&quot; a note.</p><p>However, one could also have pitch bends that only affect notes<br/>yet to be played - I&apos;ve seen this mentioned as a possible<br/>implementation of Midi pitch bends - with the recommendation that<br/>any synth that provides this option should also implement the<br/>more usual approach where one can retune notes in play.</p><p>One could also as a more novel feature have a pitch bend that<br/>applies only to the very next note to be played.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if many synths or soft synths implement this option.<br/>However FTS has to retune notes in play in response to the pitch<br/>bends anyway as a separate step, since they get moved to new<br/>channels in order to play microotnal chords. So that makes it an<br/>easy matter to leave that step out so that notes already in<br/>play keep their existing tuning when you apply a new<br/>pitch bends.</p><p>So, I&apos;ve added both those options to FTS:</p><p>In | Options | Kbd options | Only retune new notes</p><p>and also the novel one:</p><p>Pitch bend applies to next note only</p><p>Perhaps these may be useful on occasion for microtonal accidentals type composing.</p><p>You can save your midi clips in your notation program,<br/>and then play them in FTS using Views | Retuning midi player (midi format 0 only)<br/>to hear them.</p><p>Alternatively, relay the midi output of your sequencer or notation program<br/>to FTS via Midi Yoke Junction.</p><p>Then you can record in FTS as it plays to convert into a midi file that<br/>uses pitch bends to retune all the notes in play, for playback<br/>on most sound cards and synths.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=41390 href="#41390">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2002 5:30:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI there,</p><p>in case it isn&apos;t clear from the prev. e-mail, the idea is that<br/>you could play a microtonal chord in a single channel<br/>if the pitch bends only applied to notes in the future<br/>after the bend.</p><p>Obviously best thing is if one used a synth that had<br/>a switch on it to change between the two modes.</p><p>However one can also use FTS in this way to achieve the<br/>same effect, which it will do by moving the notes to be<br/>played to new channels as needed within FTS.</p><p>Then you do a microtonal chord as a series of note ons<br/>and pitch bends as e.g. a triad:</p><p>pitch bend for 1st note<br/>note on for 1st note</p><p>pitch bend for 2nd note<br/>note on for 2nd note</p><p>pitch bend for 3rd note<br/>note on for 3rd note</p><p>all in the same channel.</p><p>If your sequencer or notaton program allows one to<br/>set the order of midi events even when they are played<br/>simultaneously all those events could be simultaneous<br/>but in that order.
