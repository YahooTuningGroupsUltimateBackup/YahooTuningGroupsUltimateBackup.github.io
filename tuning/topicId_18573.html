I&apos;ve talked to my<br/>supervisor about possible thesis topic ideas (related to music<br/>technology) and one of his recommendations was to explore the use of<br/>computers to adjust dynamically the tuning of the Equal Temperament<br/>System so that it will be more &quot;in tune&quot;. (I don&apos;t even know whether the<br/>last sentence actually makes sense, cause I&apos;ve only got a very sketchy<br/>idea in my head at the moment)  I&apos;ve just started reading literature on<br/>the topic of different tuning systems (the basic Pure, Pythagorean,<br/>Meantone and Just).  Does the concept of being &quot;perfectly in tune&quot; exist<br/>in keyboard music (and other instrumental compositions) composed<br/>exclusively in the Equal Temperament Tuning?

His efforts so far leave<br/>all other dynamic tuning methods in the dust. Perhaps for your thesis<br/>you can tackle some of the issues he hasn&apos;t had time for so far, like<br/>true &quot;no tuning file&quot; runs, and compositions that begin in an equal<br/>temperament other than 12-tone .</p></div>
