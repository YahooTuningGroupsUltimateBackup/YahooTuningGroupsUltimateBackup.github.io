That would be essentially painless.</p><p>I would prefer this approach. There is of course still the Mills ftp-site<br/>but its drawback is that there is no http equivalent and hence the contents<br/>are not findable with most search engines.<br/>The same cron script could remove old postings, fill an archive, make<br/>author-,<br/>subject-, soundfile indices, etc.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
