I&apos;m wanting to up-date my<br/>home synth studio after some 12 years.  I&apos;m interested in a synth with<br/>microtonal capabilities (global and 12-note scales) for<br/>ethnomusicological analysis, and for recreational composition...</p><p>I&apos;m considering the Kurzweil 2500 Sampler-keyboard, because of it&apos;s<br/>microtonal functions and sampling features built into one unit with a<br/>nice keyboard (I can also get a B-stock for a reasonable price).  But it<br/>seems that for a similar price the Roland 2080 offers a much wider<br/>spectrum of sounds (better quality sounds, too, it seems).  I&apos;m not sure<br/>whether the Roland offer a similar facility in retuning.</p><p>I&apos;m familiar with the Lofflink site.  It&apos;s great, but it is difficult to<br/>judge without trying out all of these, especially with the help of<br/>someone who knows, which is hard to find at the buying sites...</p><p>Thanks for any input, on the list, or privately at:</p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:musicmap@iname.com">musicmap@iname.com</a></p><p>Andrew Kaye</p></div>
