Also, I would like to thank<br/>Joe Monzo for some earlier dialogues via e-mail on related topics,<br/>which have helped spur me to write this article.</p><p>In my view, the specific conventions of key-oriented tonality in the<br/>18th-19th centuries in European composition represent the taste of one<br/>era rather than some &quot;universal&quot; tendencies of musical evolution, or<br/>even of European musical evolution. If we explore the 14th, 16th, or<br/>20th century, we find other conventions in effect -- not surprisingly,<br/>conventions with some common assumptions or stylistic norms which seem<br/>to link them to 18th-century practice and theory, or vice-versa.</p><p>For whatever reason, traditional 20th-century music history often<br/>tends to take 18th-century practice as the norm for &quot;tonality,&quot; and to<br/>judge other periods in terms of the presence or absence of<br/>18th-century features. It seems to me that with equal (in)validity,<br/>one might take, for example, Schoenberg&apos;s 12-tone system as the<br/>evolutionary &quot;goal,&quot; and argue that composers of the 14th-19th<br/>centuries were &quot;attempting&quot; to use all 12 steps of a chromatic scale,<br/>leading finally to the &quot;inevitable&quot; triumph of dodecaphony.</p><p>Here I would like to suggest a different approach to Renaissance<br/>tonality, which focuses on vertical as well as horizontal aspects in<br/>16th-century terms, with reference to medieval tonal and harmonic<br/>paradigms also.</p><p>While I find the term &quot;modality&quot; not unapt to describe one aspect of<br/>medieval and Renaissance tonal practice, this term can hardly<br/>encompass in itself the vital _vertical_ dynamics of the music, as<br/>shaped both by the changing norms of complete stable harmony and by<br/>the choice and interaction of directing two-voice progressions in<br/>moving between stable harmonies, or in some cadential progressions<br/>from an unstable to a stable sonority.</p><p>Specifically, I shall here argue -- to a great extent expanding on the<br/>views of writers such as Richard Crocker and Carl Dahlhaus, although<br/>the responsibility for any infelicities is purely mine -- that<br/>Renaissance tonality is based on a fascinating interaction between<br/>a new aesthetic of 5-limit sonorities and a traditional medieval set<br/>of 3-limit directed progressions. This interaction, as much as the<br/>choice of modal scale materials, helps to shape the unique qualities<br/>of harmony in the 16th and earlier 17th centuries.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Early tertian tonality: new sonorities, old progressions<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In describing the tonality of the Renaissance and Manneristic eras --<br/>say from 1450 to 1650 -- the term &quot;modal&quot; is indeed _one_ useful tool<br/>of orientation. Theorists of the era from Tinctoris (1477) to<br/>Glareanus (1547), Vicentino (1555), Zarlino (1558), Lippius (1612),<br/>and Bernhard (c. 1655?) themselves take the modes as an important area<br/>of polyphonic practice and theory. Indeed, in the famous debate<br/>between theorist and critic Giovanni Maria Artusi (1600, 1603) and the<br/>Monteverdi brothers (1605, 1607) whose &quot;modern&quot; style he attacks, both<br/>sides accept the system of 12 modes, but disagree as to whether it is<br/>possible to compose a successful piece mixing several modes.<br/>Interestingly, the Monteverdi brothers cite some conventional<br/>16th-century pieces to show that this is indeed a technique available<br/>in traditional practice as well as in the new practice they champion.</p><p>At the same time, 16th-century concepts of modality are often<br/>pragmatic and flexible -- as are many later approaches to key-based<br/>harmony. Thus Vicentino describes the prevailing style of his day as<br/>&quot;mixed and tempered music,&quot; referring to the typical mixture of modes<br/>as well as the tempering of the fifth on keyboard instruments (with<br/>1/4-comma meantone or 31-tet his apparent model).</p><p>To place Renaissance and Manneristic concepts of polyphonic modality<br/>in context, we must also consider the issues of vertical sonorities<br/>and progression, in fact issues also emphasized by these theorists.</p><p>Here I shall argue that one interesting way of viewing Renaissance<br/>tonality is to see a kind of fluid fusion betweeen two guiding forces:<br/>a &quot;modern&quot; desire for full 5-limit or &quot;triadic&quot; sonority as the norm<br/>of complete harmony, that is, Zarlino&apos;s &quot;third-plus-fifth-or-sixth&quot;<br/>and Lippius&apos;s _trias harmonica_; and a continued orientation to<br/>traditional medieval progressions based on a 3-limit or trinic<br/>system.</p><p>In the medieval tradition of the 13th and 14th centuries, we may say<br/>that two-voice progressions and multi-voice sonorities are &quot;in sync,&quot;<br/>both being based on fifths and fourths as the most complex stable<br/>intervals. Directed cadential progressions typically involve two-voice<br/>resolutions from an unstable interval to a stable one by conjunct<br/>contrary motion (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8, m7-5). Writing for three or<br/>more voices is based on the stable trine (outer octave, lower fifth,<br/>upper fourth) as the unit of complete harmony, and on progressions<br/>from unstable combinations to stable trines, ideally complete.</p><p>This trinic tradition nicely correlates with a &quot;3-limit&quot; concept of<br/>stability, and with Pythagorean tuning as an apt acoustical<br/>expression.</p><p>During the 15th century, however, the ideal of sonorous euphonious<br/>shifts toward a more and more pervasive &quot;5-limit&quot; concept, with thirds<br/>and sixths increasingly favored as the norm. This stylistic change<br/>correlates with a shift from Pythagorean tuning to tertian just<br/>intonation systems or meantone temperaments for keyboards as ideal<br/>acoustical expressions.</p><p>However, in practice and theory, the traditional &quot;3-limit&quot; or trinic<br/>resolutions continue to guide harmonic progressions -- albeit<br/>progressions often transformed by the emerging Renaissance norm of<br/>&quot;5-limit&quot; or triadic sonority. Especially important are those<br/>resolutions proceeding from a third or sixth to a traditionally stable<br/>3-limit interval: e.g. m3-1, m3-5, M3-5, M6-8.</p><p>Before seeing how these resolutions are superimposed or harmonized to<br/>guide progressions between full 5-limit sonorities, let us consider a<br/>curious aside: might 16th-century tonality be at once in some sense<br/>both &quot;modal&quot; _and_ &quot;major/minor&quot;?</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Renaissance harmony: both modal _and_ major/minor?<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>While the &quot;major/minor&quot; concept in traditional musical historiography<br/>and analysis is more or less equivalent to what I term the &quot;key<br/>system,&quot; here I would like to suggest that in 16th-century terms,<br/>16th-century music involves a contrast between complete tertian<br/>harmonies with either a major third or a minor third above the<br/>bass. At the same time, the flow of these vertical sonorities as well<br/>as the progressions of the individual melodic lines may be classified<br/>by the system of modes, with conventional and not-so-conventional<br/>accidental inflections available.</p><p>In fact, a contrast between what what might be called major and minor<br/>_triads_ is readily compatible with modal tonality not only in the<br/>16th and earlier 17th centuries, but indeed in the 20th century, when<br/>composers sometimes make the differences between modes yet more clear<br/>by avoiding inflections of a kind routine in Renaissance and<br/>Manneristic polyphony.</p><p>While Vicentino (1555) does not, to my best knowledge, focus on the<br/>contrast specifically between sonorities with string ratios of<br/>15:12:10 and 6:5:4, he does discuss the contrast between major and<br/>minor thirds, finding the former &quot;infinitely preferable&quot; for the<br/>concluding sonority of a cadence. Interestingly, Vicentino asserts<br/>that the bass is the guiding voice of the polyphonic texture.</p><p>Both Zarlino (1558) and Lippius (1612) do explore the contrast between<br/>the division of the fifth with the major third below and minor third<br/>above (string-ratio 15:12:10), and the converse arrangement with minor<br/>third below (string-ratio 6:5:4). These theorists, recognizing 12<br/>modes, group them into modes with the major third above the final<br/>(Ionian, Lydian, Mixolydian) or minor third above the final (Dorian,<br/>Phrygian, Aeolian).</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>3. Modal triadicism and the new alternation<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>In discussing the complete harmony of the third-plus-fifth-or-sixth,<br/>later the triad of Lippius, Zarlino describes and commends a vital<br/>feature of much 16th-century tonality which sets it apart both from<br/>medieval trinicism and from 18th-19th century key tonality: the<br/>frequent alternation of the harmonic and arithmetical divisions of the<br/>fifth -- or, in more recent terms, major and minor triads.</p><p>This ideal alternation of the two divisions of complete tertian<br/>harmony might be seen as a 16th-century counterpart to the 13th-14th<br/>century alternation of stable trines with unstable sonorities of<br/>various sorts. It is, of course, a much more &quot;delicate&quot; contrast, a<br/>gentle swaying between the more sonorous 5/M3 or 5|M3-m3 (major third<br/>below) and the somewhat less sonorous and conclusive 5/m3 or 5|m3-M3.</p><p>One way of looking at this aspect of harmony would be to say that<br/>16th-century tonality is more &quot;fluid&quot; with its continual alternation<br/>of major and minor triads, while 18th-19th century key tonality is<br/>more &quot;polarized,&quot; with major keys tending to dwell more persistently<br/>on major triads, and minor keys, minor triads.</p><p>A related aspect of style is the greater variety of harmonic motions<br/>typical in Renaissance as opposed to typical key harmony: in the<br/>earlier variety of triadicism, bass motions of a second or third often<br/>roughly balance those by a fourth or fifth. Around 1610, Giovanni<br/>Coperario teaches four-part harmony by cataloging progressions<br/>according to the motion of the bass by a second, third, or fourth,<br/>etc., after first noting as one of the introductory rudiments of music<br/>that at closes the bass generally falls by a fifth, or rises by a<br/>fourth.</p><p>The Dutch harpsichordist and just intonation exponent Peter van<br/>Marissing has intriguingly suggested to me in personal correspondence<br/>that bass progressions in thirds may have a certain affinity to<br/>Renaissance meantone with its pure or near-pure thirds, while the<br/>pervasive emphasis on motions by a fifth or fourth in later Baroque<br/>through Romantic music might correlate with the fifth-leaning<br/>tendencies of post-1680 well-temperaments as well as 12-tet. Certainly<br/>the third-oriented harmonic progressions of the 16th-century are<br/>characteristic (whether diatonic or chromatic), although one might<br/>wonder about the directions of the interactions involved between the<br/>shift toward key tonality and the shift from meantone to<br/>well-temperaments in the later 17th century.</p><p>Such possible tonality-tuning correlations aside, an important point<br/>here is that &quot;5-limit&quot; harmony or a close approximation<br/>(e.g. Renaissance meantones, 31-tet, 19-tet) with its contrasting<br/>harmonic and arithmetic divisions of the fifth -- or major and minor<br/>triads -- or otonal and utonal sonorities in a Partchian sense --<br/>lends itself either to modal or key-based tonality.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Renaissance progressions and Gothic traditions<br/>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>Although there are many ways of realizing a modal tonality with<br/>5-limit sonorities, 16th-century harmony more specifically often<br/>features progressions between such 5-limit sonorities guided by<br/>&quot;3-limit&quot; progressions borrowed from earlier Gothic practice.<br/>Exercising due caution, I should emphasize that the following examples<br/>represent a modern interpretation, not a connection between Gothic and<br/>Renaissance cadences drawn by Renaissance theorists themselves.</p><p>Let us consider, for example, this very common 14th-century cadence:</p><p>g&apos;-a&apos;<br/>d&apos;-e&apos;<br/>bb-a</p><p>Here we have an M3-5 resolution between the two lower voices, and an<br/>M6-8 resolution between the outer voices -- producing the total and<br/>compelling result of an unstable M6/M3 or M6|M3-4 sonority expanding<br/>to a complete trine.</p><p>In a four-part Renaissance setting, we often find the same M3-5 and<br/>M6-8 resolutions, but with a difference:</p><p>d&apos;&apos;-c#&apos;<br/>g&apos; -a&apos;<br/>d&apos; -e&apos;<br/>bb -a</p><p>Here the traditional M6-8 and M3-5 progressions still guide the<br/>movement, but we arrive at a now-stable 5-limit sonority, the fourth<br/>voice supplying a once-unstable major third, realized in a Renaissance<br/>just intonation or in 1/4-comma meantone as a pure 5:4.</p><p>From this comparative point of view, let us consider another<br/>characteristic 16th-century progression:</p><p>g&apos;-a&apos;<br/>d&apos;-f&apos;<br/>b -c&apos;<br/>g -f</p><p>From the perspective of overall sonority, we have a smooth progression<br/>between two 5-limit harmonies. Looking at the lower three voices, we<br/>have:</p><p>d&apos;-f&apos;<br/>b -c&apos;<br/>g -f</p><p>These voices form a popular 13th-century cadence, the lower voices<br/>resolving M3-5, and guiding expansion from an unstable 5/M3 or 5|M3-m3<br/>to a complete trine. The fourth voice of the Renaissance progression,<br/>again, changes the situation from an alternation between unstable<br/>cadential sonorities and stable trines to a more subtle progression<br/>between 5-limit sonorities, often guided by older 3-limit resolutions.</p><p>As it happens, both of these Renaissance progressions actually involve<br/>a sequence of two harmonic divisions of the fifth, or major triads;<br/>but a related kind of progression realizes the alternation of the two<br/>divisions recommended by Zarlino as an ideal of good harmony:</p><p>a&apos;-b&apos;<br/>e&apos;-g&apos;<br/>c&apos;-d&apos;<br/>a -g</p><p>Here the arithmetic division a-c&apos;-e&apos;-a&apos; is followed by the harmonic<br/>division g-d&apos;-g&apos;-b&apos;, with an m3-5 resolution between the two lower<br/>voices (for Zarlino, m3-5 and M3-5 are both options in multi-voice<br/>writing, although he prefers the former in two-voice writing in order<br/>to avoid a &quot;nonharmonic relation&quot; of the tritone arising from M3-5,<br/>e.g. between f and b in a progression of g-b to f-c&apos;).</p><p>If we once again look at the lower three voices alone, we have:</p><p>e&apos;-g&apos;<br/>c&apos;-d&apos;<br/>a -g</p><p>This is another typical 13th-century progression, now with an unstable<br/>5/m3 or 5|m3-M3 expanding to a complete trine by way of an m3-5<br/>resolution between the lower voices. In the Renaissance version, the<br/>fourth voice again transforms this progression into a more subtle<br/>sequence of two third-plus-fifth-or-sixth sonorities, here with an<br/>ideal alternation of arithmetic and harmonic divisions of the fifth.</p><p>Our discussion has been very sketch indeed, not considering, for<br/>example, the role of the suspension, a vital resource in the 16th<br/>century which Zarlino and others consider the essence of the best<br/>cadences. However, even these examples may suggest some of the ways in<br/>which traditional 3-limit resolutions interact with new 5-limit<br/>sonorities to yield unique and beautiful progressions.</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>5. Implications for tuning theory<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>Theorists such as Easley Blackwood and Paul Erlich, approaching a<br/>variety of tuning systems, seem to take 18th-19th century key systems<br/>as a point of orientation. Their invaluable contributions shed light<br/>on one part of the problem -- while leaving other approaches open to<br/>exploration.</p><p>If we take the transition between &quot;3-limit&quot; and &quot;5-limit&quot; systems in<br/>Western Europe as falling somewhere around the late 15th century, say<br/>arbitrarily at about 1482 (the date of Ramos&apos;s treatise proposing 5:4<br/>and 6:5 thirds), then the history of 5-limit harmony in this tradition<br/>might be very crudely bifurcated into divisions of roughly 1482-1682<br/>(modal harmony, meantone temperaments for keyboard) and 1682-1882 or<br/>so (key harmony, well-temperaments for stringed keyboards rivalled at<br/>the end of the era by 12-tet). Shortly after 1882, we move into<br/>Debussy&apos;s experiments with what might be regarded &quot;post-key&quot; and<br/>&quot;post-5-limit&quot; structures and progressions; in some cases, &quot;revivals&quot;<br/>of modal harmony.</p><p>Needless to say, these dates are conveniences; one might argue, for<br/>example, that likely &quot;5-limit&quot; (i.e. meantone) tunings and<br/>increasingly &quot;5-limit-oriented&quot; sonorities are associated with Conrad<br/>Paumann&apos;s organ compositions around 1450. Similarly, during the epoch<br/>of 1650-1680, an approximation to key-oriented tonality may have been<br/>associated with modified meantone tunings not too far from some of the<br/>formal well-temperaments documented starting with Werckmeister (1681<br/>and later).</p><p>Whatever dates we choose, an important conclusion is that the 5-limit<br/>modal tonalities of the Renaissance and Manneristic periods represent<br/>a vital alternative to 5-limit key tonality. Both historical<br/>practices, of course, are part of the source materials for<br/>20th-century practice, and for the development of new tuning systems<br/>and harmonic theories.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

Boethius<br/>gave a description of Greek letter-name<br/>notation in his book [c. 505 AD] which, in<br/>the diatonic genus, equates notes which<br/>are a schisma [2 cents] apart, but differentiates<br/>between those a syntonic comma [22 cents]<br/>apart.</p><p>Boethius himself defines the diatonic genus<br/>in the standard 3-limit Pythagorean tuning of<br/>his day, and gives precise measurements for<br/>it at the end of the book.  He is generally regarded<br/>by scholars today as being concerned solely with<br/>music as a science (as a required step towards<br/>the understanding of Philosophy), and as being<br/>not interested at all in describing the musical<br/>practice of his time.</p><p>But the letter-name notation he describes was<br/>used by *musicians* to replace the cumbersome<br/>terminology used by the theorists, and this is<br/>proof enough to me that the musicians themselves<br/>were recognizing the syntonic comma of the<br/>5-limit.  And Boethius certainly did not devise the<br/>letter-notation himself.</p><p>During his lifetime, his homeland of Italy had been<br/>conquered by the Ostrogoths, and was thus<br/>already a German kingdom.  His intention was to<br/>preserve the great ancient Greek body of scientific<br/>knowledge in the face of the &quot;barbarian onslaught&quot;,<br/>and his book is largely a translation into Latin of a<br/>lost Greek treatise by Nicomachus, whose book<br/>would certainly have had the same Greek<br/>letter-notation, and who lived during the 200s.</p><p>It is supremely ironic that the book which I see<br/>as giving the earliest definite evidence for the<br/>use of 5-limit pitches in practice, was the very<br/>one which, enshrined as the fount of musical<br/>knowledge, entrenched 3-limit usage in the minds<br/>of the theorists for another 1000 years (until<br/>Ramos&apos;s treatise of 1482).</p><p>(This is in my book, and will be the subject of an<br/>upcoming webpage)</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
