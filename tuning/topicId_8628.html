Thanks<br/>&gt;&gt; again, Monz!!!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; I must have skimmed by this. Sorry, Monz. What Digest would<br/>&gt; it have been on.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll go back and get it.</p><p>Jerry: I was going to say &apos;probably the one you deleted&apos;.  :)</p><p>But it&apos;s not.  The reference is to my post in TD 533.11<br/>- the same Digest that had both Paul&apos;s comment and your<br/>response to my &apos;rude&apos; post.</p><p>I&apos;ll save you the trouble, because the same info is on a<br/>webpage at:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/i-iv-v7-i/i-iv-v-i.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/i-iv-v7-i/i-iv-v-i.htm</a></p><p>It illustrates the I-IV-V7-I progression outlined by Dave<br/>Keenan in a recent post [TD 529.21], using a variety of<br/>tunings including the 7-limit one you like, the 5-limit<br/>one I illustrated last week, an adaptive pseudo-7-limit one<br/>proposed by Dave, and others, and has a MIDI-file for each<br/>example - with, I should add, a nice bland vibrato-less<br/>harmonium patch (General MIDI &apos;reed organ&apos;).</p><p>I intentionally uploaded this experiment without giving my<br/>own reactions to the different tunings, so that others would<br/>listen to it unencumbered by my own personal bias.</p><p>Since Paul [TD 533.14] and Carl [TD 535.5] have given their<br/>reactions, I suppose now I can state mine.  Briefly.<br/>I agree completely with both of them.</p><p>My favorite for sheer beauty of sound is Dave&apos;s adaptive-JI<br/>tuning.  It has all the sensuousness of the 7-limit version<br/>with none of the &apos;nausea&apos; experienced by Paul.  Sure sounds<br/>close to barbershop to me.</p><p>The 5-limit version with the 9:16 &apos;7th&apos; gives a nice<br/>dissonance on the V7, and sounds like it would work great<br/>for a lot of &apos;classical&apos; music.</p><p>The one with 5:9 sounds terrible; I suppose there are<br/>contexts where it would work, but probably nowhere near<br/>as many as would befit the tuning above; most likely,<br/>it would sound a lot better following a chord which does<br/>*not* contain a 4/3, but rather, a 3/2 or some flattened<br/>&apos;5th&apos; (in relation to the tonic) descending to the 27/20.<br/>I suggest that Dave Keenan stop considering this tuning the<br/>&apos;standard&apos; 5-limit &apos;dominant 7th&apos; chord.<br/>(and I&apos;m going to miss you too, Dave)</p><p>The meantone version to me sounds much more bland than<br/>any of the JI versions, altho I would argue strongly in<br/>favor of it for performance of Baroque keyboard music<br/>simply out of historical appropriateness.</p><p>The 12-EDO version sounds more bland than that.  But the<br/>V7 *is* a lot smoother than any of the non-7-limit JI versions.</p><p>The Pythagorean V7 sounds horrible to my ears.  The fact<br/>that it&apos;s really out of context here, in the midst of a<br/>bunch of 5-limit triads, doesn&apos;t help it any.</p><p>The V7 with the 64:81 and 4:7, on the other hand, sounds<br/>quite good to me, probably because of the gravitiational<br/>effect, noted in my text, being exerted by the sharpness<br/>of the &apos;3rd&apos; and the flatness of the &apos;7th&apos;.  To my ears,<br/>it makes a strong resolution onto the I.</p><p>And my major dissenting opinion:  I really *like* the regular<br/>7-limit version.  The sliding around of the pitches doesn&apos;t<br/>bother me at all.  I suppose this is because of the direction<br/>my own composing has taken over the past few years, exploring<br/>all kinds of alternate tunings for familiar chords.</p><p>Post some more adaptive-JI schemes that distribute the 63:64<br/>differently and I&apos;ll add them to the collection.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
