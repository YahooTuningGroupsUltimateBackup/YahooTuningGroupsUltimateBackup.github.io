I am in doubt about the method to represent this<br/>feature on the screen; at present an usual keyboard allows to start<br/>tones by clicking on its keys; I thought to use split keys, up to 5<br/>segments per key, but I fear the segments would appear too small. Can<br/>you wizards of microtuning suggest alternate methods of representation<br/>on the screen?</p><p>Another issue. The program internally manages the notes as MIDI codes,<br/>so that future versions can easily connect the tone generators to MIDI<br/>signals coming from outside. MIDI rules assign a code to each key; how<br/>could multiple frequencies for the same key be represented using MIDI<br/>codes?</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Greetings from Italy</p><p>Leonardo Perretti<br/><a href="mailto:leo.perretti@projectpp.it">leo.perretti@projectpp.it</a></p></div>
