From what I&apos;ve read, those fifths are actually tuned WIDE, somewhere around 713-740&cent; depending on the ensemble; the octave itself is also around 10&cent; wide.  I&apos;ve gotten the impression from all I&apos;ve read though that the octave can also be compressed, and that the most important feature is to have beating at 5-8 times per second--gamelan music is ALLLLLL about having beating!  So from a gamelan perspective, a 3/2 fifth might be considered &quot;blown&quot;.</p></div>
