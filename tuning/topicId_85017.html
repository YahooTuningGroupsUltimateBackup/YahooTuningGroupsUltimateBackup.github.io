Each retuning command affects the particular key in all octaves, which means that you can use up to 12 commands if you want to retune all the keys in all octaves. Of course, the disadvantage is that you can&apos;t retune, for example, C1 by +20 cents and C2 by -40 cents at the same time on the same MIDI channel. Scala has the ability to send these commands through MIDI or to a file, unfortunately only for retuning the channel #1. AFAIK, Scala itself allows to do this only if a 12-tone scale is loaded. You should be able to do that by using &quot;Set synth 108&quot;.

My experimental setup<br/>&gt;&gt; was as follows:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1. SCALA was running in Windows XP Virtual Machine (Parallels Desktop<br/>&gt;&gt; 3.0),<br/>&gt;&gt; 2. The 12-tone subset of Yarman-36c quantized to 12000-EDO was the<br/>&gt;&gt; chosen tuning,<br/>&gt;&gt; 3. PETERSON AutoStrobe 590 was up and running with the same tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; set,<br/>&gt;&gt; 4. A Line-Out from my Macbook Pro was connected to Alesis M1 Active<br/>&gt;&gt; Mk2 speakers,<br/>&gt;&gt; 5.

As the title of this thread implies, I<br/>have measured the S-YXG50 Reed Organ output with Peterson AutoStrobe<br/>590. The YAMAHA SoftSynth is, according to Petr, using the XG tuningstandard.

The microphone was connected to AutoStrobe and the<br/>speakers giving the sound output were Alesis M1 Active Mk2. Using the<br/>Chromatic Keyboard in SCALA, I started from the 440 Hz A (900 cents<br/>from C) and travelled up a quarter-tone by 1 cent increments. The<br/>instrument was a Reed Organ patch from the S-YXG50 wavetable.<br/>Measurements indicate that SCALA&apos;s one cent increments do not match<br/>the increments measured. That is to say, SCALA says it is 1200-EDO,<br/>but S-YXG50 cannot microtune to 1200-EDO. It so appears that S-YXG50<br/>does not microtune by cent increments as Petr said it should.</p><p>Where can I obtained S-YXG100?

If you want to use PB for<br/>&gt; retuning, could you try to measure PB increments directly from any<br/>&gt; sequencer, not controlled by Scala? Just set PB range to major second<br/>&gt; by RPN. If software is OK, there must be always some increment in<br/>&gt; Cents when you shift PB one step more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This way you can isolate where problem is. I doubt it&apos;s Scala, so<br/>&gt; more probably S-YXG50. There were more versions, some of them had<br/>&gt; some issues, and newer versions were not necessarily better than<br/>&gt; older ones.

If you want to try out XG SysEx commands for microtuning, then you can do the following:<br/>Load a 12-tone scale with a period of 2/1 and type &quot;Set Synth 108&quot;.<br/>Then type &quot;Send/screen&quot; to see if the tuning deviations fit in the -64..+63 cent range.<br/>If they don&apos;t, type &quot;Set adjustment&quot; and try &quot;Send/screen&quot; again.<br/>If it still doesn&apos;t work, then load another 12-tone scale which does.<br/>Finally, type something like &quot;Send/file example&quot;, which will create &quot;example.mid&quot; where the first MIDI channel will be retuned to the specified scale (I&apos;m going to contact Manuel to tell him how to make it possible for the other channels).<br/>This means there won&apos;t be any notes in the MIDI file, only the tuning commands. So you can then connect an external MIDI keyboard to your sound card, run the MIDI file to retune the channel #1, and then try playing channel #1 on the external keyboard to hear if the microtuning works.</p><p>BTW: To answer your question: I used an XG-specific SysEx command (that&apos;s why it didn&apos;t work in your other player) which shifts the channels 1 to 4 a semitone lower.</p><p>And then, I don&apos;t know anything about Roland Virtual Sound Canvass tuning capabilities.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2009 2:57:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 18 Oct 2009, at 11:49 AM, Ozan Yarman wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; O Daniel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it not quite evident at this point that the highest S-YXG50 can<br/>&gt; microtune is by increments of about 1.3 cents, which strikingly<br/>&gt; implies 77 equal divisions of the equal semitone or 924-EDO?<br/>&gt;</p><p>That would be very unusual, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s so.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This I glean from the fact that neither the XG synth model nor the GM<br/>&gt; synth model selected in SCALA makes a difference with the YAMAHA Soft-<br/>&gt; Synth.

My experimental setup<br/>&gt; was as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. SCALA was running in Windows XP Virtual Machine (Parallels Desktop<br/>&gt; 3.0),<br/>&gt; 2. The 12-tone subset of Yarman-36c quantized to 12000-EDO was the<br/>&gt; chosen tuning,<br/>&gt; 3. PETERSON AutoStrobe 590 was up and running with the same tuning set,<br/>&gt; 4. A Line-Out from my Macbook Pro was connected to Alesis M1 Active<br/>&gt; Mk2 speakers,<br/>&gt; 5.

If you<br/>&gt; want to try out XG SysEx commands for microtuning, then you can do<br/>&gt; the following:<br/>&gt; Load a 12-tone scale with a period of 2/1 and type &quot;Set Synth 108&quot;.<br/>&gt; Then type &quot;Send/screen&quot; to see if the tuning deviations fit in the<br/>&gt; -64..+63 cent range.<br/>&gt; If they don&apos;t, type &quot;Set adjustment&quot; and try &quot;Send/screen&quot; again.<br/>&gt; If it still doesn&apos;t work, then load another 12-tone scale which does.<br/>&gt; Finally, type something like &quot;Send/file example&quot;, which will create<br/>&gt; &quot;example.mid&quot; where the first MIDI channel will be retuned to the<br/>&gt; specified scale (I&apos;m going to contact Manuel to tell him how to make<br/>&gt; it possible for the other channels).<br/>&gt; This means there won&apos;t be any notes in the MIDI file, only the<br/>&gt; tuning commands. So you can then connect an external MIDI keyboard<br/>&gt; to your sound card, run the MIDI file to retune the channel #1, and<br/>&gt; then try playing channel #1 on the external keyboard to hear if the<br/>&gt; microtuning works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW: To answer your question: I used an XG-specific SysEx command<br/>&gt; (that&apos;s why it didn&apos;t work in your other player) which shifts the<br/>&gt; channels 1 to 4 a semitone lower.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And then, I don&apos;t know anything about Roland Virtual Sound Canvass<br/>&gt; tuning capabilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2009 10:40:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Maybe answer is Pitch Bend resolution and setting of a range.

Can you &gt; make heads or tails of my measurements?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz.</p></div>
