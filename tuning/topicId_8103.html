W. A. Mathieu, in _Harmonic Experience_, backs up my point of view<br/>perfectly (the beginning of chapter 42):</p><p>&quot;. . .an entirely new musical force.</p><p>&quot;_The Equal-Tempered Chromatic Scale_</p><p>&quot;The new force arises from the ear&apos;s response to a succession of tones<br/>equidistant from one another. On the equal-tempered keyboard, play a<br/>chromatic scale evenly, without particularly choosing where you begin or<br/>end. The ear hears the even spacing between the pitches with the same kind<br/>of perception with which the eye sees the even spacing of a picket fence or<br/>the lines of type on the printed page.<br/>    In just intonation, no such thing occurs. A just chromatic scale is<br/>quite uneven, containing a wide variety of semitones depending on the<br/>tuning, potentially including not only the [5-limit] 16:15, 25:24, 135:128,<br/>and 27:25 but also the Pythagorean 256:243, as well as the septimal 28:27<br/>and 21:20. To hear such chromatic scales played smoothly and rapidly sounds<br/>haphazard and unmusical; indeed, they have the cumulative effect of a poorly<br/>constructed picket fence. Even in the various unequal temperaments<br/>(including meantone and Bach&apos;s well temperaments), a chromatic scale has<br/>nothing of the smooth sheen ours possesses.<br/>    Before the days of equal temperament, the tones of a chromatic passage<br/>were heard in terms of their harmonic function. . . . sing each tone of the<br/>slowly rising scale in just intonation as a functional resonance (including<br/>the dissonant but compelling 45:32 F#). The issue of equal distance is<br/>nowhere in sight. What we get is a cogently bonded melodic ascent<br/>accompanied by wildly divergent harmonic contrasts: rare, but dramatically<br/>useful when used in moderation. Likewise, if you tune a keyboard (electronic<br/>or chromatic) to some version of the just chromatic scale and play it slowly<br/>over the tonic or dominant, you can also hear the widely divergent harmonic<br/>effects; if you play the same just scale rapidly over several octaves but<br/>out of tonal context, the harmonic effect disappears and the melodic residue<br/>is simply uneven -- in fact, it sounds out of tune. Now play the scale<br/>rapidly on the equal-tempered keyboard and hear how the various harmonic<br/>functions simply disappear beneath the gloss of evenly spaced percussive<br/>events<br/>     . . . .<br/>    An equal-tempered chromatic scale out of context is purely melodic and<br/>_merely_ chormatic (see chapter 35); it has no tonal function and no proper<br/>spelling. It is difficult for the modern ear, which takes such things for<br/>granted, to imagine how the new aural artifact was heard by the<br/>eighteenth-century ear, but the surviving literature tells much of the<br/>stort. Chromatic flourishes in Bach are rare (and usually appear in the<br/>context of descending diminished triads), but by Mozart&apos;s time, chromatic<br/>scales in cadenzas were common. Between 1750 and 1790, as equal temperament<br/>became more the rule than the exception in Europe, and as it became more<br/>familiar, composers and improvisors gradually began to resond to its newly<br/>available effects. By the early nineteenth century, chromatic scales were<br/>part of the compositional fabric.<br/>    Play an equal-tempered chromatic scale again, up and down several<br/>octaves in one hand, not too fast, and let your ear savor its regularity,<br/>its newfangled, manufactured, precisely measured _sameness_. Don&apos;t be bored,<br/>be fascinated, mesmerized. This sensibility opens the door for the more<br/>complex symmetrical forces hidden inside the Trojan horse of equal<br/>temperament.&quot;</p><p>In a later chapter, Mathieu introduces a new definition for the<br/>&quot;superdiesis&quot;, contradicting the one he introduced earlier (that I quoted a<br/>few weeks ago). The new definition is the same as what others have called<br/>the &quot;major diesis&quot; arising from a chain of four 6:5 minor thirds, and<br/>Mathieu finds it as an interval of equivalence in Bartok&apos;s &quot;In the Style of<br/>a Folk Song&quot; from _Microcosmos_.</p><p>Mathieu uses a modified type of standard notation called &quot;tone lattice<br/>notation&quot; to represent 5-limit JI. He writes,</p><p>&quot;Tone lattice notation is most suitable for music that can be performed with<br/>few or no Didymic [=syntonic] commas, and the Medieval literature abounds<br/>with such pieces. _Fumeux fume_ by Solage, a French composer who flourished<br/>in the late fourteenth century, is a remarkable mix of architectural<br/>subtlety and pentamerous sweetness. This rondeau was evidently composed for<br/>a &quot;society of smokers&quot; -- possibly of opium or hashish -- who no doubt<br/>delighted in the stylistic whimsy and intricate design. . . .<br/>    The harmonic motion of Solage&apos;s piece is almost grotesquely extended,<br/>yet the journey through the vast territory is beautifully balanced and<br/>etirely believable. The net result is hardly caprice, but rather, deep<br/>satisfaction. A most wonderful thing is that there is no harmonic ambiguity.<br/>No singer or player needs to sing or play through a single comma, and each<br/>part has modal as well as melodic intergrity. . . .&quot;</p><p>It would be wonderful to have a MIDI file of this piece (which is written<br/>out in the book). Also, we might ask Margo, isn&apos;t the late fourteenth<br/>century a bit early for a French composer to be using 5-limit so<br/>extensively? Was Solage ahead of the currents of his time?</p></div><h3><a id=8114 href="#8114">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2000 3:13:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul:</p><p>If you sort out the topoi in which chromatic scales are used in Mozart (and<br/>Haydn) you will find nothing of the romantic steely precision found in<br/>later, romantic musics (or even in Bach, for that matter).  Instead,<br/>chromatic textures are used for exoticism, danger, or catastrophe (i.e.<br/>accompaning the Stone Guest  in _Don Giovanni-). For these purposes, the<br/>uneven patterns of meantone chromatic scales are ideal.</p><p>There is also a technical argument to be made: Viennese classical fingering<br/>avoided the thumb, thus passage work was continuously broken into grupetti<br/>of two or three pitches, yielding anything but the smooth effect of high<br/>romantic pianism. (in contrast, Bach famously used his thumb!).</p><p>Coincidentally, I hope to find the time in the next month or so to offer the<br/>list a review of the three volumes of  Herbert Kelletat&apos;s &quot;Zur musikalischen<br/>Temperatur. The first (1992) deals with &quot;Bach and his time&quot;, the second with<br/>Viennese classicism, and the third with Franz Schubert.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=8138 href="#8138">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2000 6:22:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Are we talking about the same Mozart and Bach???
