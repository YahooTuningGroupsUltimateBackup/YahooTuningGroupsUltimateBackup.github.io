In defense<br/>of Kraig and his Anaphoria, I detect no phobias in his postings.  It appears to me that Kraig has<br/>not &quot;retreated to the Anaphoria inside [his] head,&quot; but rather has created Anaphoria out of his<br/>head.  By making his music and legends available to others, he has given us a new place to<br/>&quot;visit,&quot; just as Tolkien created Middle-earth, which can now be &quot;visited&quot; by anyone who cares to<br/>read &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; etc.  That&apos;s a thoroughly right-brain activity, and is difficult to<br/>explain or appreciate using left-brain techniques alone.  An academic topic mailing list like<br/>this, by its nature, is biased toward left brain activity.  To gain insight for a greater<br/>appreciation of people who seem to live almost exclusively out of their right brains (like our<br/>friends Kraig Grady and Neil Haverstick might), I suggest reading the following short web page:</p><p><a href="http://www.viewzone.com/bicam.html">http://www.viewzone.com/bicam.html</a></p><p>It&apos;s all very interesting to me, but about half way down the page is a table, half black with<br/>white text and half white with black text, which gives an excellent summary of how the two sides<br/>of our brains work.  This basic understanding has been of great benefit to me.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

The view today is to<br/>put the creators and their egos on a pedestal - and evaluate art by<br/>numbers of objects that are sold, or how cool they look. But when you<br/>strip away all the trappings of much of this kind of consumer art,<br/>you find no substance. Allot of the time, all it is - is the ego and<br/>the haircuts - the glitz and the glamour. Perhaps we need to reflect<br/>more about what it takes to make people want to experience our art<br/>over and over, rather than the disposable way that music and many<br/>other forms are used today. What does it take to make a work endure<br/>repeated listenings? Perhaps Kraig is onto something here!</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this same tradition, Kraig Grady, by creating his Anaphoria, has<br/>&gt; made a place where music is created, and it is not stamped with his<br/>&gt; own ego... ostensibly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The compositions are NOT by the composer Kraig Grady, but are by<br/>&gt; residents of a communal world...<br/>&gt; _____________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=12208 href="#12208">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2000 9:38:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [David J.
