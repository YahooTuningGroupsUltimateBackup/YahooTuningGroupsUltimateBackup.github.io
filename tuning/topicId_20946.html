Referring to a &quot;thing&quot; I called &quot;tuning three&quot;</p><p>41141</p><p>&gt; &gt;Tuning three certainly doesn&apos;t have this property, BUT, all<br/>&gt; &gt;intervals are unique. So &quot;7&quot;, despite being a &quot;fourth&quot; between<br/>&gt; &gt;the two flavors of &quot;third&quot; is still uniquely a fourth. (This<br/>&gt; &gt;is the special word I was looking for).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, that would be the case for any non-ET tuning of the scale, right?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, the way I spelled this, one could think of it as a pentatonic<br/>in 11-et. The point I was wondering about is that strict propriety<br/>seems to say that all intervals are ordered and unique (three steps,<br/>whether there are one or ten flavors in the scale, is larger than<br/>two steps). You said the diatonic is not strictly proper which I take<br/>to mean because it is ordered but not unique (&quot;three steps is always<br/>less than or equal to four steps&quot;). So in this example the intervals<br/>are unique, but not ordered.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Thanks for the post regarding ways to think of transposability<br/>&gt; &gt;with decatonics. I like the &apos;disjoint MOS&apos; interpretation the<br/>&gt; &gt;best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean MOS within a half-octave periodicity, or two interlaced MOSs?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I meant the interlaced MOSs.

The former implies propriety;<br/>the latter, strict propriety. Of course, strict propriety implies uniqueness<br/>but uniqueness does not imply strict propriety. To clarify for others,<br/>&quot;uniqueness&quot; here means that each specific interval size is mapped to one<br/>and only one generic (i.e., counting number of steps in the scale) interval<br/>size.</p><p>&gt;I meant the interlaced MOSs.

One problem is that each of the<br/>tetrads (analogous to the diatonic&apos;s triads) end up 3 notes in one<br/>pentatonic scale and 1 note in the other pentatonic scale -- but which one<br/>has 3 and which one has 1 depends on the chord. Hence it would seem quite<br/>difficult to project the full harmonic variety in a bi-pentatonic approach.<br/>Anyway, the pentachordal decatonic scale is quite effective as an integrated<br/>whole melodically, and doesn&apos;t beg for a division into two pentatonics,<br/>particularly when tetradic harmony is used.</p></div>
