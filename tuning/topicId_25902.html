It&apos;s hard enough for<br/>&gt; moderns to accept that Werckmeister promoted a non-12 equal in his first<br/>&gt; description of a 12 majory/minor key circle.  Since there is a prevalence of<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic in  central Germany, Bach&apos;s distinctiveness would<br/>&gt; require serious evidence to the contrary.  I await more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or else, what OTHER rational and more appropriate criteria should be<br/>&gt; &gt; applied,<br/>&gt; &gt; for assessing two irregular baroque tuning systems?? (Their fifths being<br/>&gt; &gt; structured 7+5, respectively 8+4).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; If you have evidence of 7+5 tuning for Bach I&apos;d love to hear of it.<br/>&gt; Incidentally, Werckmeister never claimed to have invented &quot;Werckmeister III&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;chromatic Werckmeister.&quot;  He described it as already in practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; REMARKS:<br/>&gt; &gt; There is no sufficient reason that in Werckmeister III the third C-E is<br/>&gt; &gt; bridged<br/>&gt; &gt; by 3+1 fifths, tempered, respectively perfect.

By your criteria one would think this to be better,<br/>but in reality this this is inaudible to most, and very probably all,<br/>listeners ears. Even with 1 cent it is at least debatable whether that<br/>interval is hearable to anyone ... let alone in a real musical performance.</p><p>Even if perhaps a few individuals could hear this extremely tiny difference<br/>it would be the extreme minority of individuals with this ability ... if any<br/>individuals. This is not even to mention whether by ear somone tuning these<br/>instruments really could have made the very fine adjustments and been able to<br/>tell the difference.</p><p>I suppose it is &quot;possible&quot; that 0.00000001 percent of the population could<br/>have heard the difference, heard that these intervals were better by your<br/>criteria, and successfully tuned the instrument according to this &quot;better&quot;<br/>criteria. I suggest, however, that when intervals are as small as the<br/>differences are here that it becomes less and less important to make<br/>distinctions about one system or interval, or etc, as being better at all.</p><p>To sum up for an interval to be a better interval three criteria must be met<br/>as oppossed to just your one criteria.</p><p>The first is that you must show via some logical method that the interval is<br/>better, and these one cent differences you speak of seem to do this fine(in<br/>this isolated instance).</p><p>The second point however is that these differences must be audible to human<br/>beings. In this case I think it is a fair argument to say that &quot;if&quot; these<br/>differences are audible, that only the extreme minority can hear them, if<br/>anyone at all. If the differences between these intervals are not hearable<br/>then the tuning system is not better or worse but exactly the same to the<br/>listener. (In this context listener includes the person tuning the<br/>instrument, the composer, and the audience)</p><p>Lastly it must be possible to tune instruments correctly to this very small<br/>interval distance &quot;by ear.&quot;  Certainly electronic instruments could do this<br/>interval correctly, but to tune live instruments like this by ear would be<br/>difficult, especially if criteria two is not met and the interval differences<br/>are not possible to hear or only possible to be heard by the extreme minority<br/>of people.</p><p>This thread has been very interesting.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2001 4:13:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Herbert Anton Kellner wrote:]<br/>&gt;For your interesting statements you sent, I should like to thank you<br/>&gt;cordially.

Let me remark beforehand that you that you do have, rationally,<br/>&gt; &gt; intuitively, or else, emotionally, the appropriate attitude towards the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;problem&quot; at hand: You speak, as concerns your result, about DEPRESSINGLY<br/>&gt; &gt; close<br/>&gt; &gt; to 12-tET.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Concerning the CRITERIA I took recourse to for assessment:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1001$ are more than 1000$ - nobody would contest that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; An enlarged major third smaller by 1 cent than another one, is BETTER.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just a thought on this matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Suppose that for the sake of argument your results showed a major third<br/>&gt; smaller by 0.00001 cents. By your criteria one would think this to be better,<br/>&gt; but in reality this this is inaudible to most, and very probably all,<br/>&gt; listeners ears. Even with 1 cent it is at least debatable whether that<br/>&gt; interval is hearable to anyone ... let alone in a real musical performance.</p><p>BUT THE TWO DIFFERENCES I CONSIDERED FOR MY CRITERIA ARE 1.2 AND 1.1 CENT,<br/>RESPECTIVELY. AND NOT 0.00001 CENT!<br/>LET&apos;S TURN THE MATTER AROUND; COULD ONE JUSTIFY THAT &quot;WOHLTEMPERIRT&quot; OVERALL<br/>WERE A PRIORI WORSE THAN W III, DESPITE THAT FACT THAT THESE TWO CHARACTERISIC<br/>VALUES PICKED OUT FOR ASSESSMENT ARE, IN FACT, &quot;BETTER&quot; IN THE ORDER OF  1 CENT<br/>THAN FOR W III.<br/>THE BASIC TONAL THIRD IN BOTH CASES CO-INCIDES TO THE ORDER OF 1 CENT. BUT<br/>THERE IS ANOTHER SNAG IN W III: IF WITHIN THIS THIRD OF WERCKMEISTER THE 3 FIFHS<br/>C-G-D-A ARE TEMPERED AND FOLLOWED BY A-E perfect TO SPAN THS THIRD C-E, THEM<br/>THIS PERFCET FIFTH SQUEEZES THE THREE TEMPERED FIFTHS TO BE MORE TEMPEREED THAT<br/>UNAVOIDABLE. rEMEDCY: EQUALIZE ALL FOUR THIRDS IN NO MATTER WHAT EXACT SIZE OF<br/>C-E. IN THIS SENSE, W III IS PROBABLY, OBJECTIVELY, INFERIOR TO<br/>&quot;WOHLTEMPERIRT&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even if perhaps a few individuals could hear this extremely tiny difference<br/>&gt; it would be the extreme minority of individuals with this ability ... if any<br/>&gt; individuals. This is not even to mention whether by ear somone tuning these<br/>&gt; instruments really could have made the very fine adjustments and been able to<br/>&gt; tell the difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose it is &quot;possible&quot; that 0.00000001 percent of the population could<br/>&gt; have heard the difference, heard that these intervals were better by your<br/>&gt; criteria, and successfully tuned the instrument according to this &quot;better&quot;<br/>&gt; criteria. I suggest, however, that when intervals are as small as the<br/>&gt; differences are here that it becomes less and less important to make<br/>&gt; distinctions about one system or interval, or etc, as being better at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To sum up for an interval to be a better interval three criteria must be met<br/>&gt; as oppossed to just your one criteria.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The FIRS is that you must show via some logical method that the interval is<br/>&gt; better, and these one cent differences you speak of seem to do this fine(in<br/>&gt; this isolated instance).<br/>ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE, AN INTERVAL THAT IS CLOSER TO ITS CORRESPONDING &quot;PERFECT&quot;<br/>VALUE OR SIZE IS &quot;BETTER&quot;!?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The SECOND point however is that these differences must be audible to human<br/>&gt; beings. In this case I think it is a fair argument to say that &quot;if&quot; these<br/>&gt; differences are audible, that only the extreme minority can hear them, if<br/>&gt; anyone at all. If the differences between these intervals are not hearable<br/>&gt; then the tuning system is not better or worse but exactly the same to the<br/>&gt; listener. (In this context listener includes the person tuning the<br/>&gt; instrument, the composer, and the audience).<br/>ANY PROFICIENT TUNER TEMPERING VIA BEATS WILL DESCERN MUCH MORE SHARPLY SLIGHT<br/>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN, SAY, &quot;WOHLTEMPERIRT&quot; AND W III THAT A NAIVE LISTENER.<br/>BUT CAN&apos;T ONE EXPECT THAT A &quot;BETTER&quot; SYSTEM IN MY SENSE WILL GIVE A &quot;BETTER<br/>IMPRESSION&quot; - REGARDLESS IF THE LISTENER BECOMES RATIONALLY AWARE OF THAT OR<br/>NOT?? THIS THOUGHT NATURALLY LEADS TO YOUR LAST AND INTERESTING POINT YOU MAKE!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LASTLY it must be possible to tune instruments correctly to this very small<br/>&gt; interval distance &quot;by ear.&quot;  Certainly electronic instruments could do this<br/>&gt; interval correctly, but to tune live instruments like this by ear would be<br/>&gt; difficult, especially if criteria two is not met and the interval differences<br/>&gt; are not possible to hear or only possible to be heard by the extreme minority<br/>&gt; of people.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This thread has been very interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Andy<br/>&gt;KIND REGARDS,<br/>HERBERT ANTON k.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2001 2:27:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But when it comes to arguing which well-temperament is &quot;objectively<br/>&gt; best&quot; for the WTC, I&apos;m sorry to report that they&apos;re all worse than<br/>&gt; 12-tET by any rational measure I have seen to date.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL</p><p>Not to cast doubt on the validity of your results, but other results<br/>were obtained by other researchers.

We can&apos;t let the numbers take us in to the realm of insignificance<br/>however.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Without enouncing here the respective sets pertaining to &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; or<br/>&gt; else, to Werckmeister III,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is it conceivable that a mathematician-musician like JSB has structured his<br/>&gt; music employing and taking recourse to the numbers of such a set.</p><p>Certainly. I suggest however that when numbers get down to the inaudible then<br/>it makes no difference what the numbers say or what the musician believed he<br/>was preferring. We are discussing an art form which is based on sound. Also<br/>tuning systems, or music compositions, are something that are intended to be<br/>perceived. If the difference between two tuning systems can not be perceived<br/>then it is rather pointless to make distinctions between them. This suggests<br/>to me that decidng exactly what Bach preferred is not important.</p><p>I recently read a book on computer game graphics to draw an analogy. The<br/>author suggested that if it looks right, it is right. Why? The mathematics<br/>involved with graphics programming, he says, is important of course but if<br/>your math , within a game for example, describes things inperceivable, then<br/>it is pointless to spend time coding that extra math.</p><p>In other words I&apos;m not saying Bach did/did not want this or that tuning<br/>system. I am saying its NOT an important question to ask which system Bach<br/>preferred if and only if the two systems you suggest are so close as to be<br/>not perceivable, or debatably perceivable to one in a trillion people.</p><p>For example suppose two thing.</p><p>1. Suppose Bach preferred what you think he preferred.</p><p>2. Suppose that the difference between the two systems is inaudible.</p><p>If both of these things are true then it is still not possible to tell which<br/>system Bach used. Why, because it wasn&apos;t possible for Bach to accurately<br/>perceive which system he was using anyway.  He might have liked one set of<br/>numbers over another surely, but who cares, he more than likely couldn&apos;t<br/>accurately perceive which one he was using ... hence making it an unimportant<br/>question.</p><p>Lets take this from another perspective. If for example you said instead,<br/>&quot;What set of numbers did Bach prefer, even though he could not actually<br/>perceive the differences between the two sets of numbers?&quot;  Then I would say<br/>that that is a good question. It recognizes that it is unlikely to be known<br/>what he actually used and also recognizes that the two systems are<br/>inperceivably close and should be considered as such. Perhaps this is a<br/>clarification of the word preferred. your question seems to ask what did he<br/>prefer in theory and in practice, or what numbers did he prefer and what did<br/>he actually do.</p><p>Where as my question recognizes that all of this is in theory and NOT in<br/>practice. In practice it is very possibly impossible to tell these things<br/>apart by ear (since we are discussing Bach not computers of the present day).<br/>It asks what numbers he would prefer and says, these are just numbers and<br/>have nothing to do with what he actually did.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we find numbers of the set W III, then W III was his preferred tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If, on the contrary, we discover numbers of the set belonging to<br/>&gt; &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;<br/>&gt; in his music,<br/>&gt; then we would have to conclude, as concerns J.

It uses only the pedestrian 1/4 comma flat fifth and<br/>&gt; &gt; the pure<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect fifth.  Anything dividing into fifths is monochord<br/>&gt; &gt; activity, and Bach<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; did not tune this way.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand what you mean by &quot;dividing into fifths&quot;. You mean<br/>&gt; &gt; the 1/5 comma, as opposed to 1/4 comma, temperament of the non-just<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths? In what way is one of these &quot;monochord activity&quot; and the<br/>&gt; &gt; other not?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Breaking the comma into half, and then into half again is easier to navigate<br/>&gt; that dividing into whole fifths.  Bach could tune in 15 minutes, and without<br/>&gt; a monochord.</p><p>This he did in about 15 minutes via the B-major triad - see my website for<br/>details. This method renders, turns out first of all, the  fifth B-f# tempered<br/>smaller by P/5, whilst P is the pythagorean comma. See:</p><p>Kellner, H.A.: Das ungleichstufige, wohltemperierte Tonsystem.
