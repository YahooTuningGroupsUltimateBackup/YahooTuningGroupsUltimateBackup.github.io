I think probably so...&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s dumb enough, and beginners catch some of the information, but it&apos;s<br/>historically not quite right. The question is: should we use a historical<br/>fiction to get people going, or should we start off with as being as truthful as<br/>possible (all the while knowing every history is in necessarily fictional)?</p><p>&quot;Q. Why does the 12 tone scale have 12 notes, and why are there &quot;black<br/>and white&quot; keys on the piano?</p><p>A. Our &quot;common&quot; 12 note system, such as one would see on a modern<br/>piano, stems from a &quot;Pythagorean&quot; system which uses a string of<br/>&quot;pure,&quot; (unbeating) fifths. This system was developed in the Middle<br/>Ages, in response to the use of pure fifths as a basic consonance.&quot;</p><p>This confuses two different systems: they keyboard (and that fabled organ in<br/>Halberstadt) system which does stem from the middle ages, but only slowly<br/>settled down into a 7-5 arrangement, and pythagorean intonation, which is<br/>ancient.</p><p>&quot;A cycle of fifths will go &quot;once around&quot; 11 times before, eventually,<br/>approximating an octave at the 12th fifth. (It doesn&apos;t quite.<br/>see &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot;)&quot;</p><p>Better to say something like &quot;one can stack fifths on top of each other&quot; instead<br/>of &quot;cycle&quot;, and &quot;by the time one reaches the 12th fifth from the bottom it comes<br/>very close to seven octaves&quot;.</p><p>&quot;If one were to transpose the pitches of this chain to within one<br/>octave, one gets the 12 notes we presently use. The &quot;closest&quot; fifths<br/>to the starting point were given &quot;white&quot; keys and those further away<br/>and generally less used, were given &quot;black keys.&quot;&quot;</p><p>This only works if we&apos;re in D-dorian.</p><p>********</p><p>Joseph: perhaps starting out with the number 12 is a mistake; for notation and<br/>keyboarding, 7 is really the key number and 12 is a consequence of a particular<br/>way of working with 7.  Maybe an approach like the following would work, much of<br/>which is cribbed from the Josquin chapter in Diether de la Motte&apos;s counterpoint<br/>textbook _Kontrapunkte_.  The following is not really a draft, but a very rough<br/>sketch of how I&apos;d handle the topic, which I don&apos;t really want to do.</p><p>&quot;Q. Why does the 12 tone scale have 12 notes, and why are there 5 black<br/>and 7 white keys and why do we notate music the way we do?</p><p>A: Let&apos;s go back arbitrarily about 500 years, to central Europe around the year<br/>1500, an era associated with the composer Josquin des Pr&iuml;&iquest;&half;s.  The principal tonal<br/>material available to composers was derived from the series of eight fifths:</p><p>B - F - C - G - D - A - E - H</p><p>of which composers usually used either these seven tones:</p><p>F - C - G - D - A - E - H</p><p>or these:</p><p>B - F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>(B, a perfect fifth below F, is equivalent to Bb in modern English notation, H<br/>is equivalent to B natural).</p><p>Since the composer only need to manage seven tones at a time, a staff with seven<br/>places and a keyboard with seven keys were reasonable and compact frameworks<br/>with which to work.  To keep it compact, these seven tones were assigned to<br/>consecutive places on the staff and keyboard:</p><p>C - D - E - F - G - A - H</p><p>When the composer wanted to use the the second collection, a symbol, the flat,<br/>indicating a tone a chromatic semitone lower, was added to the staff on the line<br/>or space associated with H, thus showing the singer or player that the composer<br/>wanted the tone B (or, in English terms, Bb) instead of H (English: B natural),<br/>giving this scalar collection:</p><p>C - D - E - F - G - A - B(b)</p><p>(There are in fact, illustrations of early instruments showing keyboards with<br/>exactly seven + one keys to accomodate precisely these two collections.)</p><p>In Josquin&apos;s time, tones not properly belonging to these two collections were<br/>also used. These tones were not necessarily notated, but the players were<br/>expected to provide them.  The _subsemitonium_ (semitone below), a pitch<br/>neighboring one of the proper tones in the collections above, was featured<br/>especially in the _clausula_, stock melodic formulae associated with the ends of<br/>musical phrases.</p><p>In the first collection, there were already semitone intervals available below F<br/>and C, but extra tones needed for _clausula_ below</p><p>D, that is, D - C# - D<br/>G, this is, G - F# - G<br/>and<br/>A, that is, A - G# - A</p><p>In the second collection, there were already semitones below F and Bb, and these<br/>additional tones were incorporated for _clausula_ below:</p><p>G, this is, G - F# - G<br/>D, that is, D - C# - D<br/>and<br/>C, that is, C - B natural - C</p><p>In addition, Josquin and his contemporaries would sometimes expect in the second<br/>collection that E would be replaced by an Eb.  Composers would not explicitly<br/>notate this, but singers and players would have known when to make the<br/>substitution in order to avoid an augmented fourth or diminished fifth between<br/>Bb and E .</p><p>In this manner, musician were managing a total collection of these twelve tones:</p><p>C c# D eb E F f# G g# A Bb B C</p><p>which happened to fit nicely onto a keyboard in the familiar 7 + 5 arrangement,<br/>which may have been implemented as early as February 23, 1361, in Nicholas<br/>Haber&apos;s Halberstadt organ:</p><p> C# Eb   F# G# Bb<br/>C  D  E F  G  A  B</p><p>(The familiar keyboards today color-code the front row with ivory or white keys<br/>and the back row in ebony or black; using different materials or colors for the<br/>different rows of keys is an old practice, but the present white-black<br/>combination became fixed only around the turn of the nineteenth century).</p><p>Up to this point, we&apos;ve not mentioned anything about how these pitches were<br/>tuned. The initial string of perfect fifths could have been tuned in pure 3:2<br/>intervals, which is called, to honor one of the possible ancient discoverers of<br/>this sequence, pythagorean tuning (see PYTHAGOREAN).  Subsequently, someone<br/>noticed that the additional tones (c#, eb, f#, g#) could also be added to this<br/>series of fifths:</p><p>Eb - Bb - F - C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C# - G#</p><p>Indeed, one could continue adding fifths indefinitely in either direction and<br/>this would be accomodated in the notation through the appropriate addition of<br/>flats or sharps.</p><p>...Gb - Db - Ab - Eb - Bb - F - C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C# - G# - D# - A#<br/>... etc.</p><p>Each added tone allowed one to play music at an additional pitch height, a<br/>procedure now known as tranposition.</p><p>For most musical repertoire in the 16th through 18th centuries, however, a<br/>collection of 12 fixed pitches for keyboards and fretted instruments seemed to<br/>be a powerfully attractive economy as music was growing increasingly consumptive<br/>of tonal resources. The problem became how to tune a set of 12 pitches in a way<br/>that would satisfy ever new, multiple, and often contradictory requirements.</p><p>One of the requirements was for increased vertical consonance. The thirds of<br/>pythagorean tuning were generally considered to be not pleasant enough to serve<br/>as stable consonances in music, while real musical repertoire increasingly used<br/>thirds as consonances. The initial solution, probably derived from Islamicate<br/>tuning practices, used an the pythagorean interval created by eight consecutive<br/>perfect fifths as a close approcimation of a just major third (see PYTHAGOREAN).<br/>A later solution to this problem came in the form of Meantone temperament (MT,<br/>see MEANTONE) where the difference between a major third and of an octave<br/>reduced series of four perfect fifths (the SYNTONIC COMMA) was distributed over<br/>the series of fifths, a process known as temperament (see TEMPERAMENT). 12<br/>pitches in MT allows one to play satisfactory major triads on eight tones, and<br/>to transpose to perhaps six tonalities.</p><p>The limited number of triads and tonalities available in a MT with only 12 tones<br/>per octave provoked a search for alternative tempering schemes. Given a sequence<br/>of 12 tones separated by perfect fifths: a thirteenth tone, twelve fifths above<br/>the first, will overshoot the tone seven octaves above the first tone by a very<br/>small interval, the _pythagorean comma_ (ratio: 531441:524288, about 23.5 cents,<br/>see PYTHAGOREAN).  If this small interval is divided and distributed among each<br/>of the 12 fifths, one arrives at twelve collections of seven pitches with<br/>identical intervallic content, differing only in pitch height. This twelve-tone<br/>equal temperament (see _12tet_) has been, at least in theory, the principal<br/>tuning system for western music for approximately the last 150 years, and longer<br/>for fretted stringed instruments. In the late stages of the MT era and prior to<br/>the the rise of 12tet, many alternative well- or circulating temperaments (see<br/>WELL TEMPERAMENT) were in use, each having their distributive own strategies.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=19870 href="#19870">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/6/2001 5:21:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19843.html#19862">/tuning/topicId_19843.html#19862</a></p><p>Thank you, Daniel Wolf, for your interesting FAQ answer on our<br/>present system of 12 pitches...
