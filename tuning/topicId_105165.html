I think it&apos;s also a promising idea for exploring<br/>regular temperaments and higher prime orders.</p><p>Here&apos;s the gist. In the standard tonal lattice commas are scattered<br/>apparently at random and it&apos;s hard to see how they interrelate. But<br/>with a change of basis they can be concentrated near the origin where<br/>their relationships become clear. The dual of this lattice of commas is<br/>a lattice of ETs, which offers further insights.</p><p>I&apos;d be a bit surprised if this is a new idea, but since I&apos;ve<br/>been unable to find any prior mention of it I&apos;ll outline the<br/>principle here, starting with some basics (referenced to the 5-limit) to<br/>establish the notation.</p><p>A just interval J is the product of a JI tuning vector and a monzo:</p><p>             J = &lt;v|m&gt;</p><p>where</p><p>             &lt;v| = &lt;2 3 5|</p><p>is the JI tuning vector, here expressed in a convenient shorthand in<br/>which an underscore stands for a suitable logarithm function.</p><p>This standard coordinate system can be transformed into a rebased system<br/>using a square unimodular matrix [W] and its inverse [N]:</p><p>             &lt;w| = &lt;v|[W]                          |n&gt; = [N] |m&gt;</p><p>             &lt;v| = &lt;w|[N]                           |m&gt; = [W] |n&gt;</p><p>             [W] [N] = [N] [W] = [I]         |W| = |N| = &pm;1</p><p>where &lt;w| is the rebased tuning vector and |n&gt; is the rebased monzo.</p><p>The columns of [W] are the standard monzos for the new basis intervals<br/>and the columns of [N] are rebased monzos for the standard basis<br/>intervals.</p><p>Evaluation of an interval in the rebased system follows the usual<br/>pattern:</p><p>             J = &lt;v|m&gt; = &lt;v|[W][N]|m&gt; = &lt;w|n&gt;</p><p>After tempering:</p><p>             J&apos; = &lt;v&apos;|m&gt; = &lt;v&apos;|[W][N]|m&gt; = &lt;w&apos;|n&gt;</p><p>where J&apos; is the number of steps representing interval J in an equal<br/>temperament, and &lt;v&apos;| = &lt;2&apos; 3&apos; 5&apos;| and &lt;w&apos;| =<br/>&lt;w1&apos; w2&apos; w3&apos;| (with integer elements) are the standard and<br/>rebased vals for that temperament.</p><p>When changing the basis in this way the unimodular property can be<br/>preserved by proceeding from the identity matrix in a series of steps in<br/>which a multiple of one column (basis interval) is subtracted from<br/>another.</p><p>The interesting situation is when all the basis intervals are commas. In<br/>this case the equation</p><p>             [N] [W] = [I]</p><p>can be read as a statement that the rows of [N] are standard vals<br/>representing three ETs which temper the set of commas &lt;w| = &lt;w1 w2 w3|<br/>to &lt;1 0 0|, &lt;0 1 0| and &lt;0 0 1|, respectively. Each of these ETs thus<br/>tempers out two of the basis commas while setting the third to one step<br/>of the temperament.</p><p>Every point on the rebased lattice is both a monzo (interval) and a val<br/>(ET). This is of course also true for the standard lattice, but in the<br/>rebased system every lattice point near the origin (as well as more<br/>distant points near the JI zero plane) is the monzo of a comma-sized<br/>interval, and nearly every lattice point is the val for an ET closely<br/>approximating JI.</p><p>Expressed in the standard basis the monzos are</p><p>             |m&gt; = |m2 m3 m5&gt; = [W] |n1 n2 n3&gt;</p><p>where n1, n2 and n3 are the coordinates of a general lattice point<br/>representing the coefficients of each basis comma in the monzo, and the<br/>vals are</p><p>&lt;v&apos;| = &lt;2&apos; 3&apos; 5&apos;| = &lt;w1&apos; w2&apos; w3&apos;| [ N ]</p><p>where w1&apos;, w2&apos; and w3&apos; are the coordinates of a general<br/>lattice point representing the sizes of the commas w1, w2 and w3 in<br/>steps of the val&apos;s ET.</p><p>This lattice of commas/ETs has several interesting properties.</p><p>The standard monzos representing the intervals 2, 3 and 5, which in the<br/>standard lattice are orthogonal, fold up under the transformation like<br/>the spokes of a collapsing umbrella until they lie almost in a straight<br/>line. Other simple intervals, being small integer combinations of these<br/>primitive intervals, also lie close to this line. At the same time<br/>smaller intervals, of comma size and above, are pulled in radially and<br/>away from the JI zero plane to populate the space near the origin.<br/>Musically useful commas (those with low complexity and size) cluster<br/>around the origin and spread out more sparsely along the JI zero plane.</p><p>Viewed as a val, a rebased lattice point represents a tuning vector for<br/>an ET, and intervals in this ET (for a given monzo lattice point) are<br/>measured by distance in integer steps from a zero plane normal passing<br/>through the origin normal to the tuning vector. Since monzos for simple<br/>intervals now lie in a narrow cone of directions, their sizes in<br/>relation to the octave are approximated well by most vals, even if those<br/>vals have tuning vectors not closely aligned with the (rebased) JI<br/>tuning vector. The exceptions are those vals whose tuning vectors point<br/>nearly perpendicular to the octave monzo, and thus come close to<br/>tempering out the octave and other simple intervals.</p><p>With a suitable choice of basis intervals the rebased lattice can<br/>provide a framework for cataloguing both commas and ETs. In the 5-limit<br/>the following basis set (one of many possibilities) proves useful:</p><p>&lt;w| = &lt;c  sigma  k|</p><p>where c = syntonic comma, sigma = schisma, k= kleisma. Its<br/>change-of-basis matrices are</p><p>       [-4 -15 -6]              [ 53  84 123]</p><p>[W] = [ 4   8 -5]        [N] = [-19 -30 -44]</p><p>       [-1   1  6]              [ 12  19  28]</p><p>from which it can be seen that the associated basis ETs are 53edo,<br/>Â–19edo and 12edo. (The negative signs in the 19edo val are the<br/>result of the JI tuning vector falling in a different quadrant from the<br/>octave monzo under this transformation.)</p><p>The commas can be conveniently displayed in layers of the lattice with<br/>specified values of nk.</p><p>The nk = 0 plane contains all the commas tempered out by 12edo,<br/>including, near the origin, schisma, Pythagorean, syntonic, diaschisma,<br/>diesis, major diesis, ripple, misty, passion, and, a little to the<br/>south, close to the JI zero line, the atom of Kirnberger and a 665edo<br/>comma I call schismon (= schisma Â– atom).</p><p>The nk = 1 plane contains all the intervals (including commas) tempered<br/>to plus or minus one 12edo step. This group contains more than 30 named<br/>commas, including a vertical sequence of schisma-separated commas which<br/>are all tempered out by 53edo:</p><p>      semicomma, kleisma, amity, vulture, tricot, monzisma,<br/>Â–counterschisma, Â–mercator</p><p>which links up with a diagonal sequence of Pythagorean intervals:</p><p>      Â–mercator, 41-tone, sublimma, 17-tone, limma, apotome...</p><p>Any comma in the nk = 1 plane can substitute for the kleisma as the<br/>third basis comma to form an alternative lattice.</p><p>The comma lattice provides a framework for displaying ETs approximating<br/>the 5-limit. In the rebased lattice simple sub-octave intervals are<br/>lattice points lying close to the main diagonal of a rectilinear<br/>&grave;loaf&apos; having the octave (with coordinates |53 -19 12&gt;) at one<br/>corner. Slicing the loaf parallel to its three axes yields 53tet, 19tet<br/>and 12tet, while angled cuts give other ETs.</p><p>The zero planes for ETs tempering out a particular comma form sheaves of<br/>planes radiating from that comma&apos;s monzo vector. They appear as<br/>lines marking the intersection of their zero planes with the nk = 1<br/>plane, and fall into family groups including:</p><p>             meantone temperaments:       horizontal lines</p><p>             schismic temperaments:        vertical lines</p><p>             diaschismic temperaments:   trailing diagonals</p><p>aristoxenean temperaments:  leading diagonals</p><p>             misty temperaments:              lines with gradient -2.</p><p>Other temperament families (such as kleismic) can be plotted as lines<br/>radiating from the tempered-out comma. Regular temperaments such as<br/>quarter-comma meantone can also be plotted, and the graphic has a number<br/>of other nice features.</p><p>Another basis set, |monzisma, raider, atom&gt;, turns up the magnification<br/>to focus on schismina-sized commas and the associated temperaments.</p><p>That&apos;s it in outline (rather lengthier than I intended). I&apos;m<br/>grateful to anyone who&apos;s read this far, and would welcome feedback<br/>on the idea.<br/>Martin Gough</p></div><h3><a id=105167 href="#105167">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2012 10:38:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martingough31&quot; &lt;martingough31@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The file I&apos;ve uploaded here: &grave;MartinGough&gt;Comma lattice<br/>&gt; (syntonic, schisma, kleisma)&apos; illustrates a technique that I find<br/>&gt; useful for displaying relationships among commas and equal temperaments<br/>&gt; in the 5-limit.</p><p>It would be interesting to get Paul Erlich&apos;s reaction, as he has been the one most interested in diagrams of this sort.</p></div>
