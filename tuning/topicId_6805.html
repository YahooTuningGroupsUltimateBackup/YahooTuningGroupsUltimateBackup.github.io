I admit it&apos;s &quot;slapstick&quot; humor and not so<br/>sophisticated -- kind of like watching someone slip on a banana peel, which<br/>is how I felt when I first &quot;stepped in&quot; the Austin.</p><p>Well, I am being unfair.  Austin did a fair amount of homework, and tried<br/>his best.  He also is talented in his own style.  However, his work does<br/>not sound like Ives.</p><p>You may find Johnny Reinhard&apos;s arguments specious.  He is, after all, a man<br/>of ACTION and performance, and not really a theoretical type (shoot me<br/>again, Johnny)...</p><p>But, anyone has to agree that Johnny Reinhard&apos;s Ives Universe Symphony<br/>HOLDS UP as a descendent of Ives Fourth Symphony and Ives other works.<br/>There is NO QUESTION but that it is in the GRAND LINE...  This is why I<br/>state that I consider it an &quot;historical document,&quot;  and this is not just<br/>because I am a friend of Reinhard...</p><p>It sounds like Ives, and really has the same impact.  I&apos;ll bet anything<br/>that you would not have been disappointed if you had picked up the CD and<br/>played the Reinhard first!</p><p>BUT WE AT THE AFMM can&apos;t get the damn thing out!!!  There are a number of<br/>practical considerations concerning the CD, most of which are probably of<br/>too sensitive a nature to post over an Internet forum.</p><p>It is a really sad state of affairs, and some of us on Reinhard&apos;s board (of<br/>which I am a member) are trying to remedy this.  It is by no means a<br/>foregone conclusion, however...  The great commercial CD of Reinhard&apos;s<br/>efforts might just be &quot;far gone...&quot;</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
