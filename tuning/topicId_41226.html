I&apos;ve looked at all the standard<br/>pentachordal majors. Forget the previous post. My solution to the fact<br/>that there will be both sharps/flats and naturals in the same key is to<br/>have an up or down slash on the key signature flat or sharp sign itself,<br/>if it is an arrowed note that is flattened/sharpened. And a normal flat<br/>for unarrowed flat notes.</p><p>This means there will have to be naturals in the music, which I think<br/>you were referring to last post, but I didn&apos;t twig - sorry about that.<br/>And unlike in conventional notation the naturals might have to be<br/>notated each time they appear. I don&apos;t know about that yet.</p><p>Now the only problem I see is dealing with &apos;keys&apos; with the same<br/>signature. So far I have four pairs and one set of four that look alike.<br/>Perhaps I could put the  notes that will have naturals in brackets<br/>alongside the key signature but I think I&apos;ll try sight reading before I<br/>speculate any more.</p><p>Kind Regards<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3><a id=41241 href="#41241">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2002 11:17:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  Hi Paul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thought I&apos;d start a fresh page.
