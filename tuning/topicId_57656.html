For a work to be derivative,<br/>ie unoriginal, there needs to be clear evidence that the author was<br/>exposed to the model which you assert was copied.  For a work to be<br/>phoney, there needs to be evidence of an intent to deceive.</p><p>As to whether it is kitsch, that would have to be a subjective<br/>judgment.

Others might see it as a tribute,<br/>a homage to people who made significant and useful musical discoveries.</p><p>[PG]  seriously, I don&apos;t won&apos;t to be an asshole here,<br/>[YA]  You don&apos;t?!  You do a very good imitation, you know.</p><p>[PG]  but this &quot;Nomad&apos;s Song&quot; is so inauthentic --<br/>[YA]  What&apos;s your criterion for authenticity?</p><p>[PG]  Enough said<br/>[YA]  Maybe more than<br/>enough._____________________________________________________________________<br/>___</p><p>So, you didn&apos;t like the work.  So, you heap contumely on it.<br/>So, you obviously haven&apos;t convinced anyone of the value of<br/>your views on the piece.

I admit that I even wrote a Prelude and a Fugue composed in homage to Bach.
