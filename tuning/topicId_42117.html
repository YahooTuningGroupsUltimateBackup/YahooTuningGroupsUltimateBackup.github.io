Bob and Ben had to<br/>take the bus back to SF, but afterward Lou, Bill and I took dinner in a<br/>whole-food place at the bottom of the hill.  Their charm, warmth,<br/>enthusiasm and evident love for each other in their mutual 80&apos;s was<br/>touching indeed.</p><p>Unfortunately I had to leave at 4.00am the next morning to drive to see<br/>the 1/4-tone flute maker Jim Schmidt near Fresno, and then to meet with<br/>Kraig, Erv, Stephen Taylor and all the dudes in LA that night.  It was<br/>such a trip...</p><p>Lou&apos;s kindness and openness discussing new instruments after dinner, and<br/>well into the night, was something to remember.</p><p>Death is a small consideration against such a magnificent life.</p><p>Patrick</p><p>--<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low,<br/><a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi</a><br/><a href="http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a><br/><a href="mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a></p></div>
