<H2>Recommendation of Equiton</H2><B>The ???? there is no dream with sight-read!</B>

<HR>


<H3>Equiton?</H3>The Equiton was devised 1958 years, by the Briton R.Fawcett of the Swiss residence. The cicely whose non articulation ease and the rhythm where the temporary sign occurs frequently are complicated - music, former description ? method (is called traditional description ? method) with is a fact where the reading ? is very difficult when you display in the background where this description ? method is born. All descriptions of former description ? method ? technical possibility is included, at the same time, the Equiton most powerful apparent is done description ?, new music as the description ? kind of method where the reading ? becomes easy. 

<H3>Sound with Equiton high and method of presentation of sound value</H3>
<H4>Sound high indication</H4>
<P>Traditional description ? method and the point where the Equiton differs sound high and are method of presentation of sound value. When 12 sound musical scales (average law) is, you write as follows.

  <LI>The line at just octave interval is pulled  
  <LI>Between two lines as for the diacritic 6 or more it puts  
</LI></UL>In case of 12 sound musical scales, because with 6 it is not enough, it copes by color classifying white and black. Other than color classification, it can cope with the music which uses differential sound such as 4 minute sounds in the same way by the fact that shape is changed.

<P></P>Then, ? trouble of reading so we will have decided to try writing the work really with the Equiton.

<H4>Part 1: 1st neatness - 9th neatness </H4>
<P>The technically that much difficult tune where this work is repelled with the Lent (expectation). But, ? reading is very difficult. The first page in the point of the reading ? is a problem in the next five points. 

<OL>
  <LI>Temporary sign many 
  <LI>The tie is used because the rhythm is complicated, more than the number of actual sounds is visible 
  <LI>Actually sound value at the glance understands 
  <LI>In order to make the voice section clear it is inscribed with 3 step ?, but because of that burden to the eye becoming large, it is 

  <LI>With upper tier and sublevel there is intersection of the hand. Distribution of the hand left and right is written on the musical score, but why that way, whether it is distributed, until the hand is really put on the keyboard, distinction is attached

<P></P>
<P>The problematical point above, everything it solves the Equiton. 
<OL>
  <LI>The temporary sign it is 
  <LI>Because the tie is not needed, the number of diacritics the number of actual sounds equal 
  <LI>As for sound value in ratio of interval left and right equal 
  <LI>Inscribing with 1 step ?, it is possible for advance of the voice section to display clearly. Because this can grant to also the diacritic of 4 diacritical markses or more the continuous line. In addition, being the place where the hand left and right is piled up because there is no temporary sign you observe to the place where it is noisy and does not become! 

  <LI>Because it is displayed in 1 step, whether the hand how has crossed glance obviously is. It depends on the composition person, " the m.g " and " m.dr. " It can interpret the meaning of ? appointment easily.

<P>Furthermore the following understood. 
<UL>
  <LI>Being possible at least ? to record three voice sections in one step, it is 
  <LI>Is expressed with traditional description ? method everything of the information which reappearance possibility 
  <LI>The space rises is saved -> the musical score cheaply 
  <LI>Because all signs are simple, the general-purpose plan compilation tool () with fair copy such as Visio is possible 
</LI></UL>In addition, in this page you devised below. 
<UL>
  <LI>2 times were shown shortly by the fact that it makes half black, (with the Equiton general applications) 
  <LI>As the sign which the voice section displays the continuous line you used (this with the Equiton general applications) 
  <LI>The special parenthesis (the *3 in the figure) it used any which are struck simultaneously when (it arranges into side, because it means to repel in order with respect to rule) 

  <LI>Because the sign of Equiton standard is not known concerning decorative sound * front knocking sound, the inscription which is close to traditional description ? method it does 
  </LI></UL>
<H4>Part 2: 23rd neatness - 28th neatness</H4>
<P>As for this part diacritic of various lengths enters and we have been disordered, it is difficult intuitively know after all to grasp sound value.

<P></P>Because shortest sound value becomes 64 diacritical markses, breadth was expanded to 2 times. This page has not succeeded in the point, conservation of the space, but after all, actual sound value, especially the fact that it can grasp ", between " visual probably is big advantage.

<H3>History of description ? method reformation </H3>
<H4>Until the Equiton change of description ? method </H4><SMALL>1998/12/18</SMALL> </CENTER>
<HR>
The history which reforms traditional description ? method was as follows. First, sound high description was improved, after that, continuance of sound was improved, and the Equiton of the shape which integrates both was born. History of the change is traced. (Of course, concerning the timbre and the strength et cetera of sound improvement is formed in the future, but we have decided that to express in chapter of the " figure musical score ", perhaps). () 

<H3>Problematical point of traditional description ? method </H3>
<OL>
  <LI>Sound high indication 
  <OL>
    <LI>‘Because all musical scale becomes the basis, all temporary signs becoming necessary in those which are not all musical scale it starts 

    <LI>To count in order to measure the musical interval it is needed 
    <LI>Octave the same sound which leaves, differing (even in the same sound section sign), it is visible 
    <LI>The highest sound (bass) in the section sign " 8va--- " becomes necessary, in many cases with the piano ? with 1 step ? the part which cannot be described occurs 
    </LI></OL>
  <LI>Indication of sound value 
  <OL>
    <LI>Ratio of the time base of sound value and the ? aspect is not fixed. In other words figure character of the musical score is not utilized well. Therefore, with complicated music the necessity to translate sound value from diacritic is born. 

    <LI>Only the diacritic which displays the multiple * fraction of 2 in regard to current price it is prepared. Because of that as for intermediate value of 3,5,6,7 and the like tieing plural diacritics with the tie, it is necessary to express. This diacritic increasing from actual sound, causes misunderstanding that is visible. 

    <LI>It can tie mutually with the flag 8 diacritical markses concerning the diacritic which is smaller than that the ??????? can state clearly, but diacritic of 4 diacritical markses or more is impossible. 

    <LI>Exceeding the neatness line, the sound which is extended is tied with the tie. This and increasing from the number of actual sounds, it is visible.

  <LI>All descriptions of the old book law where traditional description ? method was included ? it is inclusive technical possibility thing 
  <LI>Complicated music it has the ability to display more simply than old book law thing 
  <LI>It is possible, if being general-purpose (does not have to be something which only fixed style generation is displayed) 

  <LI>Also differential sound can be expressed easily thing 
  <LI>That way movement (translation) is possible the visual effect simplicity * clearly to auditory matter, thing 
</LI></OL>
<H3>Example of reformation of sound high indication </H3>
<P>The simplest example of simplification in order to describe non articulation ease is something where record semitone in just all ? 1 types. But as for this, the problem that occurs (must grant the both of flat and natural to identical sound the ???????? (gis-a-b) and the like when crowded chord is displayed it makes the reading ? difficult). 
</P>
<H4>Description ? method of ???? * ??????? </H4>
<P>What it introduces next, in order to lose the temporary sign, is method of thinking of arranging sound of 12 of octave vertically. The figure example 1b2 is proposition of the ???? * ??????? which establishs as a basis on the ???? and the ???? that it has matured even in those thoughts . In order for diacritic on the line exactly to come to the position of the black key of the piano, it arranges. Is intuitively know, but there is a following kind of problem. 

<OL>
  <LI>Width of the top and bottom becomes wide vis-a-vis the musical interval, in addition, also the ledger line increases relatively, in the eye burden applies 

  <LI>It meaning that the line is imitated to the keyboard of the piano, there is no change in all musical scale becoming the basis (it is nonconformity other than the keyboard musical instrument) 

  <LI>Sound value until recently sort heavy translation job being necessary, it is

<H4>Description ? method of cirque * ???? </H4>
<P>It is something to which this improves sound high only. Sound high description is close to the Equiton after. Weak point 1. of description ? method of ??????? It is cancelled. But, it has the same weak point concerning sound value.

<H3>Revolutionary reformation of sound value indication </H3>
<H4>????????? (Klavarscribo) </H4>
<P>When the ????????? is expressed in one word, the sound value which is the weak point of description ? method of the ??????? is displayed visual, sound high and it is something which arranges the axis of current price conversely. Concerning sound high furthermore rule we have made the keyboard of the piano, as for the black key the black ball, as for the white key the white ball, the distinction that is done furthermore, it is lowered to the top and bottom of the respective sign tail. You probably can call this one of revised methods in order to describe crowded chord. Is in order to display parallel to the arrangement of the keyboard of the thing sound high piano which arranges the axis conversely.

<P>Lastly 2 unit piano works " structure I " of the ????? the field ? with you try comparing those which were rewritten with the Klavarscribo and the Equiton. Putting to understand on the cheapness and visibility of music, the Equiton how is superior, glance obviously probably will be. Furthermore for comparing as for the Klavarscribo length and breadth it reverses.
