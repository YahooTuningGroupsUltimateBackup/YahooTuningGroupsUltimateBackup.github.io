I hope I got the Kirnberger part right...</p><p>AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA, &quot;PACIFICA&quot; -- ASIAN-INFLUENCED WORKS.<br/>SUNDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2000, CARNEGIE HALL, 3PM.  Dennis Russell Davies,<br/>conductor, Ursula Oppens, piano solo.</p><p>After Intermission we proceeded to the main work of the afternoon,<br/>the repeat performance by the ACO of Lou Harrison&apos;s PIANO CONCERTO<br/>from 1985 with Ursula Oppens, piano soloist.  Although not mentioned<br/>in the program, this was the same piece that was premiered by the<br/>orchestra in 1985 with Keith Jarrett at the ivories.</p><p>Ms. Oppens does a nice job with this piece.  I heard a few &quot;flubs&quot;<br/>here and there in octaves (aren&apos;t they TOO easy to hear!) but she DID<br/>memorize the entire work, a labor of dedication distinct from legions<br/>of pianists whose &quot;devotion&quot; to contemporary music is evidenced by<br/>the omnipresent piano score.</p><p>The most noticeable feature of the PIANO CONCERTO is the fact that it<br/>is a big &quot;alternately tuned&quot; piece.  It is NOT in the standard 12<br/>tempered pitches per octave for which we are accustomed in the West.<br/>Instead, the piano and orchestra are tuned in &quot;Kirnberger II&quot; a &quot;well<br/>temperament.&quot;  Kirnberger (1721-1783) was a student of J.S. Bach and<br/>constructed this tuning, a pretty easy one to effect.  Essentially<br/>almost all the perfect fifths (and therefore fourths) of the tuning<br/>are &quot;just&quot; (meaning no beats), with some tempering of a final &quot;A&quot; at<br/>the end of the tuning cycle.  This tuning has some extraordinary<br/>features:  just intonation major triads on C and G and just<br/>intonation minor triads on E and B.  It is no wonder that Lou<br/>Harrison is so enamored of this tuning --- it is about as close as<br/>one can come to &quot;just intonation,&quot; music with no interval beating,<br/>and<br/>still use only 12 pitches per octave.</p><p>In order to easily create an &quot;alternately tuned&quot; orchestra, Harrison<br/>chose to use only certain instruments that could play non 12-equal<br/>music easily.  Woodwinds were eliminated, as were valved brass.<br/>Remaining are strings, trombones, piano and 2 harps.  Trombone is the<br/>quintessential microtonal brass instrument, since the fundamental can<br/>be changed continuously to produce ANY pitch!  For this reason,<br/>Harrison uses THREE of them in the orchestra, and they partially<br/>compensate for all the other orchestral instruments not present.  Of<br/>course, harps and piano can easily be tuned to Kirnberger.</p><p>So what was the result of all of this alternate tuning?  Well,<br/>actually Kirnberger, having 12 pitches per octave, is not ENTIRELY<br/>removed from our &quot;regular&quot; system, so the effect is subtle.  The just<br/>intonation effects were heard especially in the solo piano passages,<br/>where the major thirds seemed noticeably narrower.</p><p>Regarding the structure of the music, the first movement, &quot;Allegro,&quot;<br/>is modal in nature, with figuration derived from Harrison&apos;s love of<br/>gamelan music.  However, his melodic lines are Western, and are<br/>extended in practically a Nadia Boulanger &quot;long line&quot; sense.  In<br/>addition, his harmonic progressions are thoroughly Western, and there<br/>is a sense that an emotional underpinning of harmony is essential in<br/>Harrison.</p><p>The second movement, &quot;Stampede, Allegro&quot; is great fun and uses many<br/>tone clusters in the piano, something Harrison learned from his<br/>studies with Henry Cowell.  He uses an &quot;octave bar,&quot; which is<br/>essentially a piece of wood (Ives uses something similar too in his<br/>CONCORD SONATA) that can play all 12 pitches of the octave<br/>simultaneously.  I would think that percussionists might love the<br/>PIANO CONCERTO, since there is a tom tom player right up at the front<br/>of the stage throughout the whole piece.  He becomes particularly<br/>active during the second movement!</p><p>The third movement, &quot;Largo&quot; is the most astonishing.  It is a simple<br/>LISTENING experience, with chords that strike deeply into the<br/>listeners&apos; consciousness.  These sonorities are echoed in the<br/>Kirnberger-tuned strings. The final movement makes a short close.  It<br/>uses bells to add to Harrison&apos;s gamelan/Western mix for this &quot;Allegro<br/>moderato.&quot;</p><p>The PIANO CONCERTO is fun to listen to.  Listening is the key with<br/>Harrison, as is emotional effect.  The overall impact of the work,<br/>particularly in the slow second movement, could support some people&apos;s<br/>contention that Lou Harrison is our greatest living American composer.</p><p>JOSEPH PEHRSON</p></div><h3><a id=14434 href="#14434">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The first<br/>recording That i heard in the late 70&apos;s was by Roger Woodard which I wore out 3 copy of the<br/>cheap vinyl it was (shame) issued on. I even attempted to get this version repressed but<br/>couldn&apos;t get pass his manager. I still find this recording a good rival to Vladimir Ashkenazy<br/>who is nothing short of a monster ( I saw him live at the end of a series of well known<br/>pianists and he was light years ahead). I had assumed he was just a pop star, boy was I proved<br/>wrong). Anyway look for the woodard version in the used bins. Nikolaeva version seemed too<br/>slow for my taste, but might be closer to a russian sentiment. There is also 3 cds of Dimitri<br/>playing these which I haven&apos;t had the money to get .<br/>    BTW there is a new recording of his 4th symphony conducted by Rozhdestvensky (if someone<br/>knows how to pronounce that, please inform). His version on Melodia is the best but this live<br/>radio broadcast is great. There is coughing from start to finish. so much you feel like it<br/>must have been performed in a TB clinic. There is something refreshing in this era of such<br/>sanitized slickness that you could still get a release like this. The power of this<br/>performance can&apos;t be stopped and rival all others, except the superior Melodia recording. It<br/>is a budget release on praga productions pr 7250 090 ( this is a subdivision of Le Chant Du<br/>Monde)  I consider this the one of the most unrecognized piece of the 20th century ( in<br/>respect to european ethnic court music) , not to mention the organ works of Jehan Alain and<br/>Sibelius 4th sym.( with its unique take on impressionism)</p><p>&gt; Before Jarrett,<br/>&gt; the only recordings of the entire work were by .Nikolaeva, for whom the piece<br/>&gt; was supposedly written.

If you ignore the A, Kirnberger II is<br/>simply schismatic Pythagorean tuning -- in other words, C major, G major, E<br/>minor, and B minor are only a schisma, or 2 cents, off from 5-limit JI. And<br/>of course you have pure fifths going around the circle starting with E, B,<br/>F# . . . and ending with C, G, D. The A being 1/2 comma flat means that,<br/>with some pain but not extreme dissonance, one can use the chords F major, D<br/>major, A major, D minor, A minor, and F# minor to &quot;get around&quot; in the near<br/>side of the circle of fifths in a way that a strict 12-tone JI tuning could<br/>never allow you to do.</p></div><h3><a id=14468 href="#14468">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
