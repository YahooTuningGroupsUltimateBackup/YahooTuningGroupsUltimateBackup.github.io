Has anybody gotten to play around with<br/>it? Does anybody use it? (Again, the idea has been implemented<br/>before on some prohibitively expensive instruments by Buchla and<br/>the guys who make or are associated with the Lime notation<br/>program, and way before MIDI on the trautonium.

It&apos;s a valid approach,<br/>and it keeps a lot of great literature alive. But electronic<br/>keyboards aren&apos;t pianos and needn&apos;t be keyboards, and composing<br/>is or can be different from piano playing.</p><p>I did one gig in my live with a cheapo synthesizer. I played it<br/>between my knees and had both hands free for the pitchwheel and<br/>the joystick. Nobody ever commented on the looks ;o) , however,<br/>I got compliments galore for my synth playing, among others from<br/>other owners of that same synth. Of course, I had my own patches<br/>for this technique, and what I was pushing up and down was just<br/>some 12tET cluster: cheapo synth.</p><p>klaus</p><p>It seems nobody ever touched that Continuum thingy?</p></div>
