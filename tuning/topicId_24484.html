Where you music is available - I&apos;m new to this thread so I&apos;m not aware.<br/>&gt;<br/>My compositions are on &quot;Raven&quot; on the Stereo Society label<br/>(<a href="http://stereosociety.com">stereosociety.com</a>).  Printed music is distributed by me directly.</p><p>&gt; 2. I , guessing, assume you write your notation to the nearest cent. Is this<br/>&gt; true or do you write more or less exact?<br/>&gt;<br/>True, and I will indicate each -1 and +1 deviation.</p><p>&gt; 3. Just curious about this one. Do you have any guess, or better yet<br/>&gt; evidence, as to the exactness that your players hit the exact frequencies<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; are asking for? Have you done any research on this? My own guess would be<br/>&gt; at<br/>&gt; least 6-10 cents off for any given and maybe much larger if its a fast<br/>&gt; passage, but this is by no means a tested theory. I&apos;m curious if you have<br/>&gt; tested in performance about this sort of thing?<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, a player can be accurate to a single cent.  If one sings a just 5/4<br/>interval of 386 cents melodically, it can be done accurately to the cent.  I<br/>have worked my life to be as accurate as possible in pitch, and have known<br/>people even more accurate.  It is not too much to accept that the top<br/>professionals can hear accurately to a cent.  And decades of concerts confirm<br/>this.</p><p>&gt; 4. Were you the first one, to the best of your knowledge, to use this<br/>&gt; performance notation?<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t really know.  It just makes the most sense.  I&apos;d had to have a<br/>particular tuning bias which limited the usage of a previously unfamiliar<br/>tuning.</p><p>&gt; 5. Have you tried putting the number of cents, +/- next to the note like a<br/>&gt; normal accidental, as opposed to up above the note, or have you found that<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; just becomes harder to read for performers?<br/>&gt;</p><p>There are several considerations:  first off consistency is important, but<br/>making the right decisions right off prevents lots of misery later.  The<br/>&quot;macro&quot; accidental (which includes basic quartertone accidentals) are read<br/>first from left to right, with the &quot;micro&quot; fine tuning right above.  This is<br/>a path that is easier to apprehend, based upon my experiences with the AFMM.</p><p>The AFMM concerts have been a wonderful laboratory for discovery.  It<br/>substituted for composition lessons, putting me in autodidact context.  There<br/>are lessons to be learned that are not in any book.</p><p>Thanks for asking!</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
