However,<br/>the dirty little secret is that any tuning that is irregular, like the<br/>squiggles, is more interesting, and hence &quot;musical,&quot; as compared with identical<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>John:  Somehow Bach notating a tune of Anna&apos;s making<br/>doesn&apos;t quite ring true. IMHO.</p><p>Johnny: Doesn&apos;t bother me at all as a possibility.</p><p>John:  The squiggle remains a fact.</p><p>Johnny:  Actually, it remains an ornament, common to the title pages of music<br/>of many composers over decades.  There is plenty of evidence available.</p><p>John:  Its strange (for Bach) even unevenness<br/>remains a mystery. Its very existence calls for an explanation because<br/>of that asymmetry. Since he was reported not to have liked the dry<br/>mathematics of tuning theory, it just could possibly be his<br/>explanation, to the examining board for the job, of how he turned the<br/>tuning pegs on his harpsichord. Or not.</p><p>Johnny:  I was liking the &quot;unevenness&quot; mystery, but you lost me on its roots.<br/> Irregularness was the &quot;coin of the Thuringian realm.&quot;  Most everything was<br/>based on an irregular aesthetic among Thuringian Germans.  It was Bach&apos;s death<br/>that set the stage for keyboard equal tempermanet.  But even that hegemony<br/>awaited the mid-nineteenth century.</p><p>John:  Since the proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating, does a<br/>harpsichord tuned in the way Mr Lehman proposes sound reasonable or<br/>not?</p><p>Johnny:  I think not.  But that is only because I am working to explore all<br/>the tuning designs.  One conclusion reached is there are a myriad of irregular<br/>well temperament, but only one identical equal temperament.  Equal temperament<br/>composition uses the idealization of its tuning for composing in the mind<br/>long before it is heard on an instrument.  Bach did this with an unequal tuning,<br/>IMHO.</p><p>John:  If it does then it could be (note &quot;could&quot; be) a plausible<br/>explanation, whoever first noticed the Sn&ouml;rkel. It seems that<br/>several/many musicians think that it does, however well or poorly they<br/>express themselves upon paper. Which surely isn&apos;t the issue.</p><p>Johnny:  Lehman is a nice guy.  With all the dissonance in the world I find<br/>it best to speak well of the nice.  But once again, the dirty little secret is<br/>that - at least to modern ears - ANY unequal and circular well temperament<br/>(meaning a full circle of 12 major and 12 minor keys) sound: better, more<br/>interesting, more musical, introduce a new dimension of understanding the composers<br/>wishes, provide a greater etching of voices to separate them in recognition of<br/>long standardized counterpoint rules, changes tempi considerations, alters<br/>phrases, influences trills...</p><p>John:  All the rest is merely noise from those with an axe to grind IMO, the<br/>fundamental issue is whether the explanation of the squiggle leads to<br/>a satisfactory tuning.</p><p>Johnny:  You simplified the question, IMO.  Choosing Bach&apos;s tuning for future<br/>performances based on one of many possibilities negates its eligibility<br/>somewhat.  With electronic tuning and multitracking for &quot;enharmonic&quot; intervals, the<br/>only real question for the public domain J.S. Bach is to continue the hunt<br/>for the most informed musical performances.  Squiggle Personality Disorder has<br/>nothing to do with it.</p><p>John:  From what I&apos;ve heard, it does. Was it what Bach<br/>used? We&apos;ll likely never know. Is it a reasonable hypothesis?<br/>Best regards,<br/>JohnG.</p><p>**************Life should be easier. So should your homepage.

I<br/>do not think listening to Bradley&apos;s squiggle tuning &quot;sounding good&quot; is<br/>proof of Bach&apos;s tuning as you presented it.</p><p>John: Other points of view are always permitted. And, as has been said<br/>by others more illustrious than I, even though I don&apos;t agree with you<br/>I&apos;ll defend to the death your right to express your opinion. I think<br/>if you re-read my post you will see that I don&apos;t use the word &quot;proof&quot;<br/>but hypothesis. There is room here IMHO for many hypotheses (?).</p><p>&gt; To the modern ear there are many different ways to listen to music.<br/> However, the dirty little secret is that any tuning that is<br/>irregular, like the squiggles, is more interesting, and hence<br/>&quot;musical,&quot; as compared with identical equal temperament.</p><p>John: Indeed so, and I fully understand and appreciate the efforts of<br/>those here to experiment and to publish their ideas here and<br/>elsewhere. But I don&apos;t think that is the point of the discussion. We<br/>are discussing, correct me if I have it wrong, what Bach may (N.B.<br/>&quot;may&quot;) have used to tune his harpsichords with the &quot;accepted&quot; keyboard<br/>layout of 12 keys (or 13 if you like) per octave. The prerequisite,<br/>anecdotally, is that he took typically up to 15 minutes to tune the<br/>instrument. IMHO that excludes ET. BTW did Bach have a tuning fork? We<br/>know H&auml;ndel had one as one was found in his effects after his death,<br/>but Bach? It was invented I believe in England during his lifetime. We<br/>can be fairly sure he didn&apos;t have our electronics! We have, again<br/>anecdotally, the information that Bach wasn&apos;t keen on the mathematics<br/>of it. We know that he had come from an era of meantone which just<br/>won&apos;t do when one wants to play in all keys. (of course, common<br/>knowledge here.) So just how did he tune his instruments? By ear, and<br/>very quickly. The scheme Mr Lehman offers is one scheme that fulfils<br/>the criteria of being simple to tune (once practised), allows<br/>modulation through all the keys and offers the &quot;tone colour&quot; of<br/>different keys that we believe was what Bach enjoyed. One other<br/>important criterion, at least for me, is that it must be easy for the<br/>players of other instruments to play with such a tuning, especially<br/>the violin in a small group, e.g. a baroque quartet. It fills that<br/>bill too. IMO. So, IMHO, a possibility. Proof? No.</p><p>&gt; John:  Somehow Bach notating a tune of Anna&apos;s making<br/>doesn&apos;t quite ring true. IMHO.<br/>&gt; Johnny: Doesn&apos;t bother me at all as a possibility.</p><p>John: Chacun a son gout. (that probably needs some accents somewhere!)</p><p>&gt; John:  The squiggle remains a fact.<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Actually, it remains an ornament, common to the title pages<br/>of music of many composers over decades.  There is plenty of evidence<br/>available.</p><p>John: Indeed so, if you want to split hairs. But a rather strange one.<br/>Most ornaments, at least the ones that I have seen, (I don&apos;t claim<br/>much research here) are regular and don&apos;t impinge upon the work, or<br/>the title of the work. If I, and I suspect you, were ornamenting<br/>something, we wouldn&apos;t have said ornament collide with the title of<br/>the article, and make it such a strange irregular shape. Again IMO.</p><p>&gt; John:  Its strange (for Bach) even unevenness<br/>remains a mystery. Its very existence calls for an explanation because<br/>of that asymmetry. Since he was reported not to have liked the dry<br/>mathematics of tuning theory, it just could possibly be his<br/>explanation, to the examining board for the job, of how he turned the<br/>tuning pegs on his harpsichord. Or not.<br/>&gt; Johnny:  I was liking the &quot;unevenness&quot; mystery, but you lost me on<br/>its roots.  Irregularness was the &quot;coin of the Thuringian realm.&quot;<br/>Most everything was based on an irregular aesthetic among Thuringian<br/>Germans.  It was Bach&apos;s death that set the stage for keyboard equal<br/>tempermanet.  But even that hegemony awaited the mid-nineteenth century.</p><p>John: I didn&apos;t offer any opinion on its roots! If Bach&apos;s manuscripts<br/>were full of such strange &quot;squiggle&quot; ornamentations we probably<br/>wouldn&apos;t give it another thought. However the fact remains that it<br/>heads his treatise on playing in all different keys and nowhere else.<br/>This must give cause for conjecture. It does to me. Such conjecture<br/>may be completely spurious, I happen to think not.</p><p>&gt; John:  Since the proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating,<br/>does a<br/>harpsichord tuned in the way Mr Lehman proposes sound reasonable or<br/>not?<br/>&gt; Johnny:  I think not.  But that is only because I am working to<br/>explore all the tuning designs.  One conclusion reached is there are a<br/>myriad of irregular well temperament, but only one identical equal<br/>temperament.  Equal temperament composition uses the idealization of<br/>its tuning for composing in the mind long before it is heard on an<br/>instrument.  Bach did this with an unequal tuning, IMHO.</p><p>John: Again chacun ... Well you may think in equal, I &quot;think&quot; and then<br/>vocalise in &quot;just&quot;. Sadly I&apos;ve done it since I was a child and a<br/>little later a treble in a boys choir, and was accused of being out of<br/>tune. I learned to sing in equal, as I had a good voice at the time<br/>and the school needed it, but since then have returned to being &quot;out<br/>of tune&quot;. I&apos;ve since learned that I was in tune, but sang a different<br/>tune. Poor attempt at humour.</p><p>&gt; John:  If it does then it could be (note &quot;could&quot; be) a plausible<br/>explanation, whoever first noticed the Sn&ouml;rkel. It seems that<br/>several/many musicians think that it does, however well or poorly they<br/>express themselves upon paper. Which surely isn&apos;t the issue.<br/>&gt;Johnny:  Lehman is a nice guy.

To some, the out of tuneness of ET can, at times,<br/>grate dreadfully. To me the timbre of the clarinet can occasionally<br/>evoke an indrawn breath and a wincing facial expression.</p><p>&gt; John:  All the rest is merely noise from those with an axe to grind<br/>IMO, the<br/>fundamental issue is whether the explanation of the squiggle leads to<br/>a satisfactory tuning.<br/>&gt; Johnny:  You simplified the question, IMO.

Bach is to continue the hunt for the most informed musical<br/>performances.  Squiggle Personality Disorder has nothing to do with it.</p><p>John: I&apos;m not sure I follow you here! Did I propose that the search<br/>for other possible &quot;Bach tunings&quot; cease? I can&apos;t see it anywhere. Do I<br/>propose it? No, categorically not. Even if I did, I think I&apos;m not<br/>naive enough to think I would be listened to. Not here anyway. Good!<br/>BUT, is the tuning Mr Lehman proposes as a possibility usable, yes,<br/>easily tunable, yes, playable with, yes, etc. At least IMO. Is it too<br/>a possible interpretation of the squiggles as a method of tuning, if<br/>indeed that is what they are? Well, I for one am reasonably convinced,<br/>at least more so than all other explanations to date. Does that mean<br/>Mr Lehamn is right? Is it &quot;the Rosetta Stone&quot;? All I can say is that<br/>it was an unfortunate choice of title. But at the end of the day it is<br/>only a title. I can forgive that. It&apos;s the body of work that underlies<br/>it that is interesting, at least to me.</p><p>Was it what Bach used? We&apos;ll likely never know. Of course, some<br/>undiscovered document may yet come to light that ezplains all. I<br/>shan&apos;t be holding my breath! But is it a reasonable hypothesis?<br/>Maybe one of the believers can ask him at the day of resurrection. I<br/>shan&apos;t be at that party.<br/>I suspect, if there is an afterlife, that he is having a good laugh at<br/>our expense.<br/>It&apos;ll probably turn out that it was one of the people who interviewed<br/>Bach at Leipzig &quot;what did it&quot;!<br/>I suspect some analysis of the ink, if that&apos;s possible, might throw<br/>some further light on the subject.<br/>But it makes a &quot;jolly fine topic for discussion.

Again IMO.</p><p>Johnny:  Your opinion is most welcome.  But it does not weigh at all for<br/>Baroque Thurignia and Saxony, particularly Thuringia.  In my new book Bach and<br/>Tuning, a chapter is devoted to the Thuringian aesthetic of the irregular.  Yes,<br/>I would not ornament with much irregularity.  But again that is a modern<br/>annecdotal position.  Thuringia, the center of Germany at its highest elevation,<br/>was different.  More evidence of that will be in the chapter.  A visit to<br/>Quedlinburg and Eisenach make it clear.  Besides most of the ornamentation on title<br/>pages of the period ARE unequal, or in &quot;such a strage irregular shape.&quot;</p><p>John: I didn&apos;t offer any opinion on its roots!

I&apos;ve since learned that I was in tune, but sang a different<br/>tune. Poor attempt at humour.</p><p>Johnny:  Sorry to hear that.  We have each had our painful experiences.  I<br/>had an out of tune bassoon that caused me to play like a singer in order to be<br/>in tune with the orchestra.  With a professional bassoon, I would later play<br/>polymicrotonally.  My carreer inculdes the regular performances of the Harry<br/>Partch Li Po Songs with their more than 43 JI intervals.  My mental scheme, which<br/>I recommend to all, is to develop a polymicrotonal theory for all tuning<br/>systems and approaches.  The single cent is as good a threshold for pitch accuity<br/>as one can find.  THEN, just and equal and Werckmeister III and Lehman, can<br/>all fit on the same page.</p><p>&gt; John: If it does then it could be (note &quot;could&quot; be) a plausible<br/>explanation, whoever first noticed the Sn&ouml;rkel.

To some, the out of tuneness of ET can, at times,<br/>grate dreadfully.</p><p>Johnny:  My true hope is that the right tunings will be assigned by consensus<br/>and over time to match composers that intended them.  At some stage the<br/>myriad of different tunings take on stronger impressions, per se.  Brahms in<br/>Vallotti, Telemann in sixth comma meantone, Ives in Pythagorean, and IMO, J.S. Bach<br/>in Werckmeister III.</p><p>John:  To me the timbre of the clarinet can occasionally<br/>evoke an indrawn breath and a wincing facial expression.</p><p>Johnny:  Ha ha!  I remember many a poingnant squeak! from an immature<br/>clarinetist.  Do you like the smoky Balkan style?  The honks are much less offensive.</p><p>John: &quot;Was it what Bach used? We&apos;ll likely never know. Of course, some<br/>undiscovered document may yet come to light that ezplains all. I<br/>shan&apos;t be holding my breath! But is it a reasonable hypothesis?</p><p>Johnny:  Yes, Werckmeister III explains everything.  Brad doesn&apos;t like it and<br/>he has explained why.  However, in the same manner as you or I, it doesn&apos;t<br/>matter what he thinks, believes, or feels as a modern explaining his own<br/>aesthetics.  On the other hand, it is valuable to hear all the variety of modern<br/>views on hearing ancient music.  It serves to point the way away from the chatter.<br/> I hope to have a CD available of my fuller explanations by December 25th.</p><p>To music!</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>**************Life should be easier.

But it does not weigh at all<br/>for<br/>&gt; Baroque Thurignia and Saxony, particularly Thuringia.  In my new<br/>book Bach and<br/>&gt; Tuning, a chapter is devoted to the Thuringian aesthetic of the<br/>irregular.  Yes,<br/>&gt; I would not ornament with much irregularity.  But again that is a<br/>modern<br/>&gt; annecdotal position.  Thuringia, the center of Germany at its<br/>highest elevation,<br/>&gt; was different.  More evidence of that will be in the chapter.  A<br/>visit to<br/>&gt; Quedlinburg and Eisenach make it clear.  Besides most of the<br/>ornamentation on title<br/>&gt; pages of the period ARE unequal, or in &quot;such a strange irregular shape.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>When I visit Th&uuml;ringen again this summer (I expect), I have done so<br/>for the last two years, basing my &quot;centre of operations&quot; (sorry BE<br/>center) at Weimar, it would be interesting to know where to visit to<br/>experience what you describe, in Eisenach (visited) and Quedlingburg<br/>(I&apos;ll look it up on my map). I assume your name is in fact Johannes?<br/>Pardon me if not. My normal centre of operations is a tiny &quot;Dorf&quot; a<br/>number of kilometres from Bonn where I have lived since the summer of<br/>2005 and Rheinbach is but a stones throw away as is the lovely Ahr<br/>valley. The Ahrweinwanderweg was wonderful this year!</p><p>All the best,<br/>JohnG.</p></div><h3><a id=79398 href="#79398">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2008 12:51:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@ wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;Johnny:<br/>&gt; &gt; To the modern ear there are many different ways to listen to music.<br/>A.S:<br/>&gt; Recently<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.orgelbau-rohlf.de/vita/vita.htm">http://www.orgelbau-rohlf.de/vita/vita.htm</a><br/>&gt; doubts about that in the actual:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.gdo.de/veroeffentlichungen/ars_organi/">http://www.gdo.de/veroeffentlichungen/ars_organi/</a><br/>&gt; &quot;Rohlf, Johannes: H&ouml;ren:<br/>&gt; Vom Klang und seinen Eigenschaften.<br/>&gt; Ars Organi 56, 2008, 168-170.&quot;<br/>&gt; p.170 #12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Nach Geh&ouml;r gestimmte Gleichstufigkeit<br/>&gt; zeigt Abweichungen bis zu 4 Cent&quot;<br/>&gt; &apos;Tuning ET by ear shows deviations up to 4 Cents&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Eine nach Geh&ouml;r gestimmte Temperierung kann nie die Pr&auml;zision der<br/>&gt; 12ten Wurzel aus 2 erreichen.&quot;<br/>&gt; &apos;Tempering an tuning by ear can never exceed (exactly)<br/>&gt; the precision 12th root of 2.&apos;<br/>&gt; ....[to be continued later]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Johnny:<br/>&gt; &gt;....One conclusion reached is there are a myriad of irregular<br/>&gt; &gt; well temperament, but only one identical equal temperament.</p><p>But back again to Johannes Rholf&apos;s lecture-note:</p><p>&quot;Deshalb wurde bis zur Anwendung des elektronischen Stimmger&auml;tes<br/>auch diese, um es polemisch zu sagen *ereignislose* mathematische<br/>Teperatur weder gestimmt noch wahrgenommen.&quot;<br/>----<br/>&apos;Polemic said:<br/>Before the arise of electronic tuners,<br/>nobody tuned nor cared a pap about that (stupid)<br/>*event-less* mathematically tempering.&apos;</p><p>&quot;Im Grunde mu&szlig; man sich ja fragen,<br/>wieso bis ins 20.Jh. hinein es m&ouml;glich war<br/>den Tonarten Gem&uuml;ts-Stimmungen zuzuordnen, obschon<br/>doch intendiert gleich-stufig gestimmt wurde.&quot;<br/>----<br/>&apos;Quest:<br/>Why remained until the 20th-century<br/>an allocation of key-characteristics,<br/>if ET was (ostensible) intended?&apos;</p><p>&quot;Kann denn alleine die Tonh&ouml;hen-Lage einer Ton-Art<br/>f&uuml;r deren Charakteristik zust&auml;ndig sein?&quot;<br/>----<br/>&apos;Can pitch alone be responsible for the characteristics<br/>of an particular key?&apos;</p><p>&quot;4 Cent Abweichung von der gleichstufigkeit ist nicht wenig,<br/>und wenn man allein diesen Wert bewusst einsetzt,<br/>dann kann man innerhalb der Tempereierung gebr&auml;uchliche<br/>Terzen reiner stimmen, als weniger gebrauchte, wie es besonders beim<br/>Stimmern von Klavieren immer praktiziert wurde.&quot;<br/>----<br/>&apos;4 Cents deviation from ET is not less,<br/>and if one applies that value concoius,<br/>then you can tune the common usual 3rds more pure,<br/>than the less frequently used ones,<br/>as especially piano-tunes had always done before.&apos;</p><p>&quot;Man kann sich also der Frage nach der richtigen oder g&uuml;nstigsten<br/>Temperatur nicht entziehen.&quot;<br/>----<br/>&apos;There is no way out to get rid of the question<br/>about the right or most convenient temperature.&apos;</p><p>&quot;Jedenfalls gibt man ein f&uuml;r die musikalische Gestaltung wirksames<br/>Mittel aus der Hand, wenn dieses Thema ausgelassen wird&quot;<br/>----<br/>&apos;Anyway one gives up an efficient musical aid out of hands,<br/>when neglecting that (important) topic.&apos;</p><p>&quot;Und da&szlig; die mathematisch genau angelegte,<br/>erst seit der Existenz des elektronischen Stimmger&auml;ts gegenw&auml;rtige<br/>Tempereierung, miter 12ten Wurzel aus 2 die farbloseste und k&auml;lteste<br/>Stimmung ist, erkl&auml;rt sich von selbst.&quot;<br/>----<br/>&apos;It&apos;s selfevident:<br/>ET is the most colorless and coldest tuning,<br/>that became primary avialable<br/>with the existence of electronic tuning-devices.&apos;</p><p>bye<br/>A.S.</p></div>
