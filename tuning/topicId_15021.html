It&apos;s ingenious to set<br/>up<br/>your coordinates so that the regular octahedron of edge 2sqrt(2) lies in the</p><p>w=0 realm and the regular tetrahedron of edge 2sqrt(2) that&apos;s opposite the<br/>octahedron lies in the w=1 realm. However, your tetrahedron is too close to<br/>your octahedron! The edge of your dispentachoron is 2sqrt(2), but the<br/>distance from the vertex (2,0,0,0) to the vertex (1, -1,1,1) is only 2,<br/>which<br/>is shorter than the edge and is definitely not allowed in a &gt;convex uniform&lt;</p><p>polytope.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to fix my movies!</p></div>
