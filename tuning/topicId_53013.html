Japanese Romaji: _uchu_ &quot;universe&quot;, _uchoten_ &quot;ecstasy,&quot;<br/>&quot;rapture&quot;,_uchujin_ [space] alien!</p><p>&quot;... simple, chaotic, anarchic &amp; menacing.... This is what people of today<br/>have lost &amp; need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily &amp; mental<br/>ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from other<br/>worlds &amp; nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which come in<br/>static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko (Donald<br/>L. Philippi)</p><p>&quot;When you&apos;re trying to do something you should feel absolutely alone, like a<br/>spark in the blackness of the universe.&quot;-Xenakis</p><p>&quot;May the great constellation of flickering ashes be heard...&quot; - Noel Scott<br/>Engel</p><p>    &quot;What strange risk of hearing can bring sound to music - a hearing whose<br/>obligation awakens a sensibility so new that it is forever a unique, new-born,<br/>anti-death surprise, created now &amp; now &amp; now. .. a hearing whose moment in<br/>time is always daybreak.&quot;  - Lucia Dlugoszewski</p><p>    &quot;For 25 centuries, Western knowledge has tried to look upon the world. It<br/>has failed to understand that the world is not for the beholding. It is for<br/>the hearing. It is not legible, but audible... Music is a herald, for change is<br/>inscribed in noise faster than it transforms society ... Listening to music<br/>is listening to all noise, realizing that its appropriation &amp; control is a<br/>reflection of power, that is essentially political.&quot; - Jacques Attali, _Noise_</p><p>&quot;...Then out to the flaming stars/From then, eventually unshackle time/<br/>&amp; traverse galaxies...&quot;   - Lou Harrison<br/>    &quot;The whole world of musics and instruments lives around us....I am<br/>interested in a &apos;transethnic,&apos; a planetary music.&quot;(&quot;...Europe is a region [Harrison]<br/>called Northwest Asia...&quot;)</p></div>
