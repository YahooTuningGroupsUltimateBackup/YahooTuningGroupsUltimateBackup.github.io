I have a book called _Bebop_ which<br/>mentions some of the instrumentalists who used this technique. But I think<br/>you missed my point, which is that Friberg&apos;s analysis shows that this<br/>1/6-of-a-beat analysis is not quite correct. It assumes that the drummer has<br/>a swing ratio of 2:1. However, the true swing ratio of the drummer will vary<br/>according to tempo, style, and the particular drummer. For example, Tony<br/>Williams playing in a slow tempo might use a swing ratio of almost 4:1. The<br/>important point that Friberg brings up is twofold:</p><p>a) The soloist uses a lower swing ratio than the drummer<br/>b) The soloist and the drummer synchronize on the _short_ eighth note</p><p>As a result, the soloist will be playing _behind_ the beat. 1/6-of-a-beat<br/>behind happens when</p><p>a) The soloist is playing even eighths (swing ratio 1:1)<br/>b) The drummer is playing with a swing ratio of 2:1</p><p>(a) would typically happen for phrases rather than entire songs, and (b)<br/>would only be approached at certain select tempo/drummer combinations.<br/>Anyway, this is not tuning, and I see Jon S.&apos;s car careening off that cliff<br/>before he gets a chance to convert my minidiscs to .mp3&apos;s!</p></div>
