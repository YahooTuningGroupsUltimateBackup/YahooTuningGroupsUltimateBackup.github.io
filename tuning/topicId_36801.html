I was actually a non-<br/>contributing member for about six months back in 1999, though the<br/>amount of time I had to devote to reading and following the posts was<br/>not enough for me to feel I could benefit from it.  Now I&apos;m back for<br/>another round.</p><p>     My name is Stephen Golovnin, and I live in sunny Seattle.  Many<br/>people on this list may know me by my previous last name, Smith.</p><p>     I spent the majority of my early life in Hollywood and Glendale,<br/>though it was only on a trip home from college that I hooked up with<br/>Ivor Darreg and Erv Wilson, back in the late 70&apos;s.  It was through<br/>Erv&apos;s guidance that I started building microtonal instruments at that<br/>time.  I was fascinated by the possibilities that arose from these<br/>instruments.  I built several stringed and marimba type instruments<br/>during the 80&apos;s.  Also during the late 70&apos;s, I worked for Serge<br/>Tcherepnin building synthesizers for Serge Modular Music Systems.</p><p>     I left the world of microtonality during the 80&apos;s because I<br/>found myself out of balance between the intellectual theory and the<br/>compellingness that music has to offer.  I studied with master<br/>musician Dumisani Maraire from Zimbabwe and played in many marimba<br/>ensembles over the next 20 years.  This definitely filled that<br/>craving in me for a compelling music to involve myself in.  I also<br/>worked with the traditional mbira, and eventually with tuning<br/>schemes.  During that time, I built many marimbas and started tuning<br/>them in a simple just intonation (C major scale).  Pretty soon<br/>everyone was using this system.  Nowadays, there are 40 or 50 marimba<br/>ensembles around the U.S. and Canada, most of them using this Just<br/>Intonation.</p><p>     Later work included a stint with the Balinese Gamelan Ensemble<br/>based out of Denver called Tunas Mekar.  Somewhere in the midst of<br/>all that, I fell in love with the piano, even with its 12ET.  (Ivor<br/>must be rolling over in his grave as I write this...)</p><p>     So nowadays, I am working with the piano, steel stringed and<br/>nylon stringed guitars (tuned in 5ths), marimbas, mbiras, and various<br/>electronics.</p><p>     A few days ago I came across Margo&apos;s post on her relationship<br/>with 11ET.  I found myself immediately drawn to her description of it<br/>that I ran over to my keyboard and retuned it to 11ET and played it<br/>through the evening, using a variety of timbres.  This to me, is<br/>where the music either speaks to me, or doesn&apos;t.</p><p>     Though I am fairly well versed in the language that surrounds<br/>tuning, I am not a high level mathematician.  Sometimes, when I hear<br/>someone speak of something that I know little about, I am inspired to<br/>learn more about it.  Other times (and usually when the writer has<br/>little or no emotional connection to their subject), I think to<br/>myself, &quot;what is there in this?&quot;</p><p>     &quot;That&apos;s enough about me, let&apos;s talk about you now...

Not so much the details (because they got chased off to tuning-math by practicing musicians who complained and whined), and not so much the application (because the practicing musicians got ridiculed into Making Microtonal Music by the mathematicians and theorists who found putting tuning to use in music pedantic and passe).</p><p>&gt; Perhaps a place where you can talk about math AND composition AND<br/>&gt; be rude to each other?  :)  Someone &apos;splain me please.</p><p>Oh, *that*. Well, that still goes on here. You&apos;ll probably see someone being rude to me sometime after this post...</p><p>(All kidding aside, you might want to go back through the message base on those two sub-lists a bit to see if anything strikes your fancy. And nothing will give you an idea of the makeup of the list then if you post a couple of pretty well-focused questions, with maybe some background too. May not get an answer immediately, but hopefully eventually).</p><p>And the lists have been a tad quiet lately, anyway...</p><p>Well, great to know we have a past, you and I!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>(P.S.

This to me, is<br/>&gt; &gt; where the music either speaks to me, or doesn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what was the verdict?</p><p>     Gene,</p><p>     Well for starters, &quot;verdict&quot; is perhaps too strong of a word to<br/>apply here (is the scale guilty or innocent?).  Suffice to say that I<br/>have worked with this tuning for several hours over the last few<br/>days.  Several questions came up for me which I will attempt to<br/>formulate here.</p><p>     Margo spoke of this tuning as being a 6 note scale derived from<br/>the 11 ET series.  First of all, what does 11-EDO refer to?</p><p>     I tuned my keyboard as she suggested, using scale degrees 0-2-4-<br/>6-8-9-11/0, with F=0.  To make things easier on myself, I also tuned<br/>adjacent notes to this same scale, thus F and F# became 0, G and G#<br/>became 2, etc.  Thus I could let my fingers fly without fear of<br/>hitting a note outside of the scale.  If I stayed on the white keys,<br/>then B and C were duplicates of each other.</p><p>     My second question is concerning modes.  Given the above scale,<br/>why would one be specifically drawn to the above mode (as opposed to<br/>using the same scale starting on a different scale step)?  And was<br/>there any reason that F was chosen as a starting point?</p><p>     In hours of improvising and searching through various timbres, I<br/>found different tonal centers to have vastly different affects.  With<br/>the center on E (9th degree), the 8 to 9 relationship takes on a<br/>leading tone flavor.  Tonal center on A (4th degree) gives it a<br/>Mixolydian flavor, with my ear hearing a major third/perfect fourth<br/>relationship between 8 and 9.  My favorite is currently centered on D.</p><p>     I remember having a conversation with my good friend Andrew<br/>Tracey, who is a leading South African ethnomusicologist.  He<br/>observed that most westerners, upon hearing a xenharmonic African<br/>scale, will automatically try to hear it in relation to either<br/>familiar intervals in the 12 ET scale, or Just intervals.<br/>Remembering this, I attempted to remove my cultural bias from the<br/>picture (close to impossible, though the efforts are rewarding), and<br/>tried to allow the intervals speak for themselves.  My experience of<br/>the scale slowly shifted for periods of time, before my mind kicked<br/>in and demanded to &quot;order&quot; the experience.</p><p>     I found that many different timbres worked well with this scale,<br/>though some of them changed the experience dramatically.  A Hammond<br/>B3 sound was especially effective, while the timbres with non<br/>harmonic partials gave yet another view.  Though I&apos;ve never read Bill<br/>Sethares&apos;s work, the ideas he writes about have informed much of my<br/>own thoughts about the evolution of scales.  Of course with the<br/>advent of electronics and so many new sounds and scales available to<br/>us, the &quot;rules&quot; kinda get shifted around a bit.</p><p>     I liked the recent posting of the &quot;gamelan&quot; piece, both with the<br/>partial content shifted to reflect 11 ET and the partials shifted to<br/>odd harmonics.  Both worked for me and the comment that these<br/>different timbres could even be combined in the same piece really<br/>opens some new doors that I wouldn&apos;t have easily come to via rational<br/>thinking.  So I opened both of these &quot;gamelan&quot; pieces in two separate<br/>windows (running quicktime), and played them simultaneously.  That<br/>was my favorite.  I wouldn&apos;t have even thought of doing that if<br/>someone hadn&apos;t mentioned the possibility.</p><p>     Anyway, that gives you a bit of an insight into the inner<br/>workings of this head of mine.  Hope it makes some sense to you.</p><p>         SVG</p></div>
