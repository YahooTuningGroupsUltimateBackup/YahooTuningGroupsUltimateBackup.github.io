None of these (considered relevant by Neidhardt)<br/>has for example the third E-G# wider than Ab-C.</p><p>The editor of EM tried to have the revised versions of those two<br/>sentences put into the printed version of our article, but was unable<br/>to have it done because the article would then have exceeded slightly<br/>the space alotted to it.</p><p> - - - - - -</p><p>By way of misprint a few numbers in the figures came out wrong:</p><p>FIGURE 2  (Equal temperament)</p><p>must of course have the same ciphers for the same class of intervals<br/>(that temperament is supposed to be &apos;&apos;equal&apos; anyway):</p><p>The -1 between Bb and F is wrong;</p><p>CORRECT is 1 (i.e. + 1 like all other fifths of equal temperament)</p><p>FIGURE 5  (An alternative interpretation of the scroll)</p><p>   Â– there MUST BE a 0 between F and B</p><p>The reason that there is a pure fifth on Bb-F in figure 5 in this<br/>alternative reading of the squiggles is the same reason, why Bradley<br/>Lehman has a larger-than-pure-fifth on the same spot of the<br/>scrolls/squiggles.</p><p>It should be always kept in mind, however, that Mark Lindley and I (as<br/>well as the larger part of the scholarly community dealing with<br/>historical research on temperament and tuning theory and practice)<br/>regard the interpretation of the squiggles as carrying a hidden<br/>temperament design as mere speculation! Evidence for Lehman&apos;s and<br/>other&apos;s claim has not been presented.<br/>Even more some of the &quot;evidence&quot; presented is simply wrong, especially<br/>there is a significant shortage in  paleographic knowledge on the side<br/>of squiggle interpreteres: Most notably and again recently is the<br/>mistake to read an &quot;E&quot; is read into a letter which is a &quot;C&quot; (and on<br/>that mistake interpretations are based ...)</p><p>FIGURE 6 (Another alternative)</p><p>Â– The cipher between A and E MUST BE  2</p><p>Â– and between  F and C it MUST BE -1</p><p> - - - - - -</p><p>Some minor corrigenda:</p><p>page 619, left column, line 8<br/>  read &quot;K&ouml;then&quot; (instead of &quot;C&ouml;then&quot;)</p><p>Endnotes 8, 11, 29, 30<br/>  The title of Ulrich D&auml;hnert&apos;s book reads<br/>  &quot;Der Orgel- und Instrumentenbauer Zacharias Hildebrandt&quot; (Leipzig, 1962)</p><p>Endnote 8<br/>  read &quot;Rechnen&quot; (i.e. capital letter R)</p><p>Endnote 18<br/>the link of HPSCHD-list is<br/>   <a href="http://www.albany.edu/hpschd-l/">www.albany.edu/hpschd-l/</a>.</p><p>Endnote 22<br/>   read &quot;Orgel-Probe&quot; (instead of &quot;Orgelprobe&quot;)</p><p>Endnote 27<br/>   read &quot;Pr&auml;torischen&quot; (instead of &quot;Praetorischen&quot;)<br/>   read &quot;Neidhardtischen&quot; (instead of &quot;Neidhardischen&quot;)</p><p>Endnote 34<br/>   read &quot;Vielfalt&quot; (instead of &quot;Vielfach&quot;)</p><p> --------------</p><p>The articles can be found at</p><p>Bach-style keyboard tuning<br/>&#x9;Mark Lindley and Ibo Ortgies<br/>&#x9;Early Music 2006 34:613-624.<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/4/613?etoc">http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/4/613?etoc</a></p><p>Bach&apos;s temperament, Occam&apos;s razor, and the Neidhardt factor<br/>&#x9;John O&apos;Donnell<br/>&#x9;Early Music 2006 34:625-634.<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/4/625?etoc">http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/4/625?etoc</a></p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>* * * * * * *<br/>Ibo Ortgies, PhD</p><p>NEW HOMEPAGE<br/><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ibo_ortgies/index.htm">http://www.freewebs.com/ibo_ortgies/index.htm</a></p><p>E-mail adress &lt;ibo dot ortgies &angst; hsm gu se&gt;</p><p>Office:<br/>TEL +46Â–31Â–773 5208<br/>Â– from January 4, 2007, new phone number +46-31-786 5208</p><p>FAX +46Â–31Â–773 5200<br/>Â– from January 4, 2007, new fax number +46-31-786 5200</p></div><h3><a id=67947 href="#67947">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2006 9:40:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; To whom it may concern!</p><p>Thanks for the note.
