A short excerpt is below.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/Comsci00/compsci2000-07.html">http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/Comsci00/compsci2000-07.html</a></p><p>There is no sign that either man knew of the others work. After the fact,<br/>however, connections between them are easy to see; they are doing the same<br/>thing but describing it differently.<br/>There is even a connection between Brocots algorithm and the Fibonacci<br/>series, where this whole quest began. To see the relation, just try using<br/>Brocots method to find ratios approximating the constant known as phi, or<br/>the golden ratio, an irrational number with a value of approximately 1.618.<br/>The series of approximants begins 1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8,. Hidden<br/>within these ratios is the complete sequence of Fibonacci numbers.</p><p>J Gill</p></div>
