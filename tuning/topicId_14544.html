I don&apos;t happen to write that kind of music because I have<br/>neither the skill set nor the patience to do so. But I am not willing to<br/>discard the efforts, talents, and creations of those who do.</p><p>&gt;     As for all of you who bag &quot;computer music&quot; your complaints<br/>&gt; are valid at<br/>&gt; this point in time, but what are you going to be saying in 10<br/>&gt; years?  You&apos;re<br/>&gt; going to be kicking yourself for not learning everything you<br/>&gt; could have about<br/>&gt; it.  The computer is the most powerful tool on the planet.</p><p>I first got interested in computer music in the 1960s when I was an<br/>undergraduate at the University of Illinois. Both Lejaren Hiller, the first<br/>person I know of to compose music by an algorithm, and Harry Partch, whose<br/>memory is revered here, were on the faculty. The first program I ever wrote<br/>and the first program I got paid to write were written for the same ILLIAC I<br/>where Hiller&apos;s &quot;ILLIAC Suite&quot; was composed. I still have the programmer&apos;s<br/>manual for ILLIAC I. :-)</p><p>That was almost 40 years ago, and &quot;the most powerful tool on the planet&quot; has<br/>replaced neither the composer nor the conventional musical instrument in all<br/>that time. In that time I have &quot;learned everything I could have about it&quot;<br/>and make my living in computer science and applied mathematics to this day.<br/>I am currently getting back into computer music after a long (18 year)<br/>absence from it. In short, I have no complaints about today&apos;s tools;<br/>computer-synthesized music is my chosen form and I welcome as much help as<br/>can be obtained from algorithmic composition.</p><p>&gt; And for those of you who prefer live performance over &quot;dead&quot;<br/>&gt; - you should<br/>&gt; wake up, too.  If you&apos;re going to achieve higher art, you&apos;re<br/>&gt; going to have to<br/>&gt; sculpt it just like you heard it.  People are going to want to hear it<br/>&gt; exactly like you did in your head.</p><p>Here I have to disagree. Music is a social phenomenon; not all music is<br/>written by a solitary composer in a room with pen and music paper. A fairly<br/>large effort by some major talents, for example, Barry Vercoe, is being<br/>invested in real-time computer music and making the computer an instrument<br/>that can participate in live performances played by a performer just like a<br/>clarinet, piano or violin. Will there ever be a &quot;concerto for computer and<br/>orchestra?&quot; Will there ever be scholarships to prestigious conservatories<br/>for young computer virtuosi? Maybe ... certainly if a piece of music comes<br/>along that is *recognized* as good that happens to be for computer and<br/>orchestra, it could happen.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there is the widespread discrimination against computer music<br/>there was in, say, Hiller&apos;s day. The simple fact is that, while a quite a<br/>number of halfway decent computer-only pieces do exist, and some pieces for<br/>conventional instruments accompanied by computers also exist, *nothing* has<br/>been written for computer and orchestra that has caught the fancy of a major<br/>musical institution, and I&apos;m not holding my breath waiting for a composer to<br/>write such a piece. Nor am I attempting to create one myself. It&apos;s just too<br/>big a job for an amateur like me.<br/>--<br/>M.

I have to disagree with you about<br/>&quot;the old ways&quot;. Just intonation, for example, is one of those &quot;old ways&quot;<br/>that&apos;s been around in some form or another since ancient Greece! The<br/>notation system is nothing more than a communication tool ... without<br/>agreed-upon tools you don&apos;t have &quot;co-mmunication&quot;, just &quot;munication&quot;. :-)</p><p>I&apos;ve seen some pretty impressive music tools in the past few months that<br/>I&apos;ve been getting back into computer music. One that stands out in my<br/>estimation is Michael Gogin&apos;s &quot;Silence&quot;, a Java wrapper around CSound that<br/>is designed for algorithmic composition. &quot;Silence&quot; features an<br/>11-dimensional musical space. Another is Phil Burk&apos;s &quot;JSyn&quot;, also written in<br/>Java, which is descended from something called HMSL (Hierarchical Music<br/>Specification Language), another algorithmic composition tool. For composers<br/>with a &quot;musique concrete&quot; bent, there is the &quot;Composer&apos;s Desktop Project&quot;.</p><p>I prefer building my own tools, and both &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;JSyn&quot; require the<br/>Java 2 Release 1.3 System Development Kit, which unfortunately occupies far<br/>more disk space than I am willing to give up for the pretty GUIs and the<br/>pseudo-portability that the current bloated Java offers. I mostly use the<br/>emerging MPEG-4 Structured Audio standard for synthesis, and for algorithmic<br/>work I use either the Derive math package, the Perl scripting language or<br/>the SwiftForth Windows development environment, depending on the nature of<br/>the task that needs to be done. The only tools I use that actually cost real<br/>money are Derive, SwiftForth and CoolEdit; everything else is freeware<br/>downloaded from the web.</p><p>And what kind of music do I write with these tools? Well ... the past few<br/>weeks I have mostly been experimenting with John deLaubenfels&apos; retuned MIDI<br/>files, getting them to play with a piano emulation &quot;instrument&quot; from the<br/>MPEG-4 Structured Audio examples. My next project is something I call the<br/>&quot;Setharophone&quot; ... a computer sound generator that uses additive synthesis<br/>and can actually compute the Sethares dissonance score as it plays. Once I<br/>get that built, I&apos;ll be posting some sounds on my web site.<br/>--<br/>M.

Music is a social phenomenon; not all music is<br/>&gt;  written by a solitary composer in a room with pen and music paper. A fairly<br/>&gt;  large effort by some major talents, for example, Barry Vercoe, is being<br/>&gt;  invested in real-time computer music and making the computer an instrument<br/>&gt;  that can participate in live performances played by a performer just like a<br/>&gt;  clarinet, piano or violin.</p><p>There is no such thing as a &quot;solitary&quot; composer.</p><p>At this point I feel like I need to clarify my overriding goal in<br/>composition.<br/>I am on a quest for higher art.

Many composers have struggled with<br/>the incarnation aspect of this trinity due to the fact that the mind can<br/>create far beyond what the embodiment can achieve.  Today, like never before,<br/>there are a plethora of emobodiments to choose from, but a large majority of<br/>them are based on a previous embodiments and have similar limitations.

I have been taught that, to achieve higher<br/>&gt; art, one must incarnate one&apos;s idea in an embodiment that conveys to the<br/>&gt; consumer as much of the idea as possible.  Many composers have struggled with<br/>&gt; the incarnation aspect of this trinity due to the fact that the mind can<br/>&gt; create far beyond what the embodiment can achieve.  Today, like never before,<br/>&gt; there are a plethora of emobodiments to choose from, but a large majority of<br/>&gt; them are based on a previous embodiments and have similar limitations.  My<br/>&gt; calling is to break free from previous embodiments and make a new one from<br/>&gt; the ground up, thus freeing us from traditional limitations and allowing us<br/>&gt; to write the most beautiful music you can imagine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for the rhetorical question of the day:<br/>&gt;     What kind of music would you write if you could easily compose (and<br/>&gt; notate) a piece at the level of timbre by manipulating the overtones?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steel sharpening steel ---<br/>&gt; Andrew F.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=14732 href="#14732">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2000 5:31:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Where is Brian McLaren when we need him!!</p><p><a href="mailto:AMiltonF@aol.com">AMiltonF@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; In a message dated 10/20/00 12:11:51 AM !!!First Boot!!!, <a href="mailto:STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET">STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET</a><br/>&gt; writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Surely you jest!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Devils advocate.
