I just ran into your archives on the Web and found a lot of fascinating reading. I founded and conduct a choir, the Cantus Angelicus Choral Society (<a href="http://www.cangelic.org">http://www.cangelic.org</a>), where we consciously pose as an ideal for ourselves a kind of adaptive Just Intonation (JI). We use special, mathematically structured warm-up exercises designed to optimize the strength of the natural feedback musicians intuitively respond to when they tune harmonic intervals (i.e., simultaneously sounded musical tones of different pitches).</p><p>This practice has enabled amateurs in a rural Iowa town of less than ten thousand, some of whom have had little or no formal musical training and can barely be said to have had the ability to read music when they joined, to sing beautiful just harmonies when given sufficient training and rehearsal time on the piece in question. Interestingly, they seem to enjoy doing Renaissance music more than anything else in our repertoire, and tend to reach a higher quality performance standard than with any other music.</p><p>For anyone with any sginificant experience working with this musical phenomenon, it is unarguably demonstrable that the human ear spontaneously tends to settle on a harmonically &quot;sweet&quot; spot, that is, to select pitches that when simultaneously sounded produce sum and difference frequencies that are coherently and simply related to the fundamentals of the sounding pitches. Mathematically it is trivial to show that this only occurs when the fundamental frequencies involved are in simple whole number relationships to each other. The only musically knowledgeable people I have found who will argue strongly against this are academics of highly questionable pedigree when it comes down to practical tuning experience and the simple musicality of their ears.</p><p>On the &quot;problems&quot; encountered with just tunings, in vocal music especially, as some of your learned contributors have noted in the context of music in general, these fine points of tuning are much more critical in the context of harmony than in that of melody. I am a string player, and only a week or two after beginning my studies empirically noticed the syntonic comma between a first finger, first position E on the D string a major sixth above the open G and the &quot;same&quot; E a perfect fourth below the open A. The latter is, of course, a syntonic comma higher than the former. The syntonic comma is no small error, only slightly less than a quarter of an equal-tempered semitone. Yet even some of the string players among the tin-eared academics to which I referred earlier never seem to have noticed this!</p><p>In the example of the two Es on the violin, psychoacoustically the technically uninvolved listener&apos;s ear doesn&apos;t seem to notice easily the slight melodic shift between one E and the other in tuning to the G first and shifting up to tune to the A immediately afterwards. Very few among even the most seasoned musicians with very precise and musical hearing will notice such a melodic shift in the context of a piece music.** Since vocalists trained to hear and produce just harmonic intervals are constrained only by their ears and the purity of their harmony, shifting melodically to &quot;fudge&quot; the mistunings that would otherwise occur harmonically in order to avoid pitch drifts, etc. is not a problem and goes undetected by both the performers and their audience. It is done intuitively.</p><p>Fortunately, the close coincidence of the beginning and end of the cycle of justly tuned perfect fifths, differing only by the Pythagorean comma of about 24 cents,  and the melodically acceptable approximation of equal temperament to just tuning, together allow for a lot of subtle dynamic fudging, eliminating the need for undesirable and clearly detectable tempered compromise in otherwise exquisitely tuned vertical harmonies. Furthermore, this supports the natural tendency of the human ear to want closure and a sense of pitch stability even in music that is chromatically complex and full of lovely and clever harmonic modulations.</p><p>So personal experience strongly indicates that the following three factors combine happily, the first two allowing reconciliation with the last, to allow intuitive dynamic adjustments or &quot;adaptive JI&quot; to work as a stunningly beautiful and practical approach to a cappella performance of appropriate music:</p><p>1) the psychoacoustically non-critical nature of small melodic pitch shifts of &quot;the same note&quot; in terms of sequential pitches, (i.e., melodic perception)<br/>2) the near coincidence of the first and final pitches of the &quot;cycle&quot; of fifths and the consequent melodically close approximation of equal-temperament to just intervals<br/>3) the human psychological need for a sense of a stable reference pitch and ultimate closure vis-a-vis the same pitch reference from a compositional viewpoint</p><p>I cannot imagine, given the historical evidence of wide-spread sensitivity to tuning schemes, the nature and quality of the composition of the times, and the natural tendency of well-trained human ears to gravitate toward it, that this is any other than an authentic performance style for the High Renaissance. It is an added bonus that even when performing music accompanied by equal-tempered instruments, singers trained to sing justly tuned intervals intuitively adapt and sing much better in tune in this context than their counterparts lacking in such training. It seems clear that this is because they have been experientially drenched in the practical application of the first principles behind the comprises that equal temperament implements.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Robert P.

I only intended to indicate that the happy circumstances<br/>that permit the MELODICally acceptable approximation of equal<br/>temperament to JI allow pretty much unlimited successful MELODIC<br/>fudging in the service of maintaining pure vertical harmonies in the<br/>context of pretty much ANY modulation to ANY desirable key.</p><p>I agree that the gradually developing melodic memory of ears trained<br/>to favor JI evolves toward intervals closer to meantone than to equal<br/>temperament. This is a carefully considered statement based on a lot<br/>of empirical experience with vocal resources that are relatively<br/>naive musically and understand intellectually next to NOTHING about<br/>JI.</p><p>For example, if I hold down a sustained octave drone with a fifth in<br/>the middle (e.g., C-G-C&apos;), somewhat like the tamboura in classical<br/>Indian music, and have the choir sing a major diatonic scale against<br/>it, they will intuitively home in on the unequal whole steps of the<br/>Major second and minor third above the tonic.</p><p>They are totally unaware that they are unequal, but just naturally<br/>tune for the most coherent relationship to the drone. I must<br/>emphasize that this is only with a choir that has been TRAINED to<br/>RECOGNIZE intuitively the most coherent relationship or &quot;sweet spot&quot;<br/>between or among the components of harmonically related tones.</p><p>If I ask them to sing the minor seventh within the fifth-filled<br/>octave drone, they spontaneously tune to the 7-limit ratio, so the<br/>drone chord 4:6:8 (same as 2:3:4)becomes 4:6:7:8. If I drop the upper<br/>octave and switch the fifth to a fourth (e.g. C-F), they<br/>spontaneously retune to a Perfect fourth above the fourth so the 7-<br/>limit Bb(-) becomes a Bb about 31 cents higher. I use this exercise<br/>deliberately, alternating back and forth, to develop their<br/>sensitivity to finer pitch differences.</p><p>Carl, on the mathematically designed tuning exercises I use as part<br/>of the warm-up for the choir, I haven&apos;t published these yet, but hope<br/>to find a grant to help develop a choral workshop that will<br/>incorporate this and other unique approaches to choral training. The<br/>only copyright I have on them for the moment is the statement of<br/>copyright on the score. I have no problem in sharing these with any<br/>interested parties who agree not to violate the copyright and to<br/>duplicate only with the statement intact, giving credit where credit<br/>is due.</p><p>The exercises are exceedingly simple, and the mechanics of their<br/>power for ear training are quite a trivial matter to comprehend once<br/>revealed, so it could be tempting just to feel that they are public<br/>domain and proceed as if they were one&apos;s own. I should add that the<br/>timbre of the synth drone we use is critical, and the vowel used<br/>should be ooo (Italian or Latin u), since this optimizes clear<br/>feedback.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., rwendell@c... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Since vocalists trained to hear and produce just harmonic<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt;are constrained only by their ears and the purity of their<br/>harmony,<br/>&gt; &gt;shifting melodically to &quot;fudge&quot; the mistunings that would<br/>otherwise<br/>&gt; &gt;occur harmonically in order to avoid pitch drifts, etc. is not a<br/>&gt; &gt;problem and goes undetected by both the performers and their<br/>&gt; &gt;audience.

This promotes a degree of<br/>HABITUAL PITCH ERROR DURING PERFORMANCE, and MOST ESPECIALLY during<br/>choral performance, that makes even the compromises of well-tuned<br/>equal temperament LOOK GOOD by contrast.</p><p>This culture is often so arrogant as to assume a linear evolution<br/>that to them implies that the older &quot;primitive&quot; instruments imposed<br/>even worse performance standards with respect to pitch than is common<br/>today!

Thanks for your contributions to this<br/>thread. I&apos;m not an extremest about vibrato. I believe it is a natural<br/>consequence of good vocal technique. But a healthy vibrato involves<br/>very modest pitch modulation, largely consisting instead of a<br/>moderate fluctuation in volume and timbre. In my book, this kind of<br/>healthy, natural vibrato is totally compatible with the adaptive JI<br/>to which I referred in the discussion on Renaissance music.</p><p>However, I also believe that there are times when an almost ram-rod<br/>straight tone is &quot;de rigeur&quot;, especially when very subtle shifts in<br/>pitch mandate it for the reasons of perceptual clarity to which you<br/>both refer. Note that even in much Indian classical performance of<br/>ragas, there is often vibrato present, but it is quite moderate, and<br/>completely disappears in the context of subtle microtonal inflections.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Jay Williams &lt;jaywill@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; At 04:06 AM 8/7/01 -0000, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Further, too many singers spend years training their voices<br/>only<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; become prima donnas in amazingly high places (who puts them<br/>&gt; &gt;there?)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and impose severe pitch problems on their listeners and<br/>&gt; &gt;instrumental<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; accompanists in blithely blissful, arrogant ignorance of their<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pitifully unmusical renditions.

If you have any recommendations, I would be<br/>&gt; delighted to consider them! Please include a good source for<br/>&gt; acquiring this music.</p><p>&gt;Our friend Andy Stefik here recently remastered Ben &gt;Johnston&apos;s String<br/>&gt;Quartets 1-6 and 9, and he provided us with Ben&apos;s e-&gt;mail address for<br/>&gt;ordering the 2-CD set. Many of did that, and were very &gt;impressed by<br/>&gt;the music (which covers several radically different &gt;styles in<br/>&gt;Johnston&apos;s career). Perhaps Andy can refresh you on &gt;the info or you<br/>&gt;can look through the archives and find it yourself.</p><p>I&apos;m on my cross country trip at the moment but happen to have access to a computer as I&apos;m staying at a friends house in New Mexico. Feel free to contact Ben directly about the CD. <a href="mailto:benbetjo@aol.com">benbetjo@aol.com</a>.</p><p>A very minor correction is that all of the quartets mentioned were remastered except for the ninth. The ninth was recorded digitally already and didn&apos;t require remastering. All of the others were remastered though just as you said. 1-6 came form original tapes and 9 was ripped from a CD.</p><p>Bob, feel free to ask Ben about getting his publisher info. I would give it here, but I dont remember the address of his publisher off the top of my head, but Ben will know of course. His publisher should have any scores you would need as well.</p><p>As for commercial recordings of his music, since you asked, there is a different version of the 4th quartet on the Kronos album &quot;white man sleeps.&quot; Ben has another album called &quot;Ponder Nothing.&quot; Both of these were available on <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> last I checked.</p><p>Last but not least if you still cant find everything you want he has an archive somewhere in illinois. Its not in Urbana/champaign where he taught. I think it is in chicago. Anyway Ben can fill you in on the nitty gritty details of that if you want.</p><p>That would be enough info I think.

Add the digits and the sum is 9=3^2, so divide by 3 to<br/>get<br/>&gt; 39, subract the 9 to get 30, divide by the 2 to get 15.

In response to the following:</p><p>A lot of people seem to feel that vibrato is anathema to alternate<br/>tuning, or *correct* tuning of *any* kind.  That&apos;s why I was so happy<br/>that my violist in Russia, Vera Gubenkova, went out of her way *not*<br/>to use vibrato... more than in standard technique.</p><p>Brian McLaren seems to disagree on this opinion of the value of<br/>vibrato in alternate tuning, but I suppose that discussion should be<br/>on the &quot;Brian McLaren Tuning List...&quot;  (CrazyMusic)</p><p>____________ __________ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>Rather than a long back and forth, I&apos;ll just share my thoughts on<br/>the vibrato issue for those interested readers who might come along.</p><p>As I implied earlier in this thread, I don&apos;t take what I consider<br/>the extreme position of no vibrato at all. It is a natural component<br/>of bel canto (the definition of which is much debated and would<br/>require another long discussion, but my understanding of which I do<br/>hold as an ideal approach to vocal technique). There is probably AT<br/>LEAST as much ignorance and distortion concerning bel canto practice<br/>in the mainstream world of vocal music today as there is concerning<br/>tuning and stylistic authenticity in early music.</p><p>In my book, SOME vibrato in singing is a natural feature of ideal,<br/>musically expressive technique and not a mechanical artifice<br/>superimposed solely for arbitrary aesthetic reasons. Indeed, some<br/>effort would be required to remove it. Admittedly, the wobbling of<br/>the hand and/or fingers in string playing is a mechanical artifice<br/>arising from the desire to make the instrument &quot;sing&quot; in<br/>imitation of the human voice. This can be exaggerated, of course, as<br/>easily as the technical infirmity known as a &quot;wobble&quot; in some<br/>of the<br/>singing to which we have referred earlier.</p><p>Nonetheless, to perpetually maintain ram-rod straight tones can be<br/>dangerous. It can lead to rigidity, destroying natural vocal ease and<br/>freedom. Even in Indian singers of classical ragas there is often<br/>some vibrato, but it disappears in the execution of the microtonal<br/>inflections common in that music.</p><p>Interestingly, the technique typically used in the shorter, faster<br/>moving microtonal inflections is closely akin to the natural vibrato<br/>of what I consider to be true bel canto. This doesn&apos;t contradict<br/>the<br/>earlier statement that vocal vibrato is not simply some kind of<br/>arbitrary mechanical artifice. The virtuoso technique I hear in the<br/>best Indian singers for these inflections is something like a natural<br/>vibrato coordinated within very precise rhythmic and pitch<br/>parameters. Good technique always swims along the currents that<br/>nature provides, riding them to maximum advantage for a minimum of<br/>effort.</p><p>If you listen to the MP3 at our site (<a href="http://www.cangelic.org">http://www.cangelic.org</a>) of Di<br/>Lasso&apos;s Adoramus Te Christe, you will hear a lot of straight<br/>tones,<br/>especially at soft dynamic levels. However, a close listening will<br/>reveal that vibrato is often there, too, but never in such a way as<br/>to interfere with the purity of the vertical harmonies.</p><p>I do NOT claim to have a choir full of good bel canto singers! Far<br/>from it! But as I mentioned earlier, the pitch modulation in a good<br/>bel canto singer with a truly natural vibrato is slight and does NOT<br/>interfere with the perception of a clear and precise pitch center!<br/>The major components of such a vibrato are modulations in vibrational<br/>amplitude and richness of timbre and only very slight modulation of<br/>pitch!</p><p>By the way, although the example cited is quite pure harmonically, we<br/>do not claim to always and consistently achieve our ideal of adaptive<br/>JI. The available vocal resources in a rural Iowa town of less than<br/>10,000 population with new singers coming in without<br/>ever having had our training put such long-term consistency beyond<br/>our reach.</p><p>Flatness of pitch came up earlier in this thread. I have had to deal<br/>with this frequently, and it is often a result of wide pitch<br/>modulation (a &quot;no-no&quot; in my book) in which the singer focuses<br/>attention on the TOP of the pitch excursions and therefore perceives<br/>it as if it were the pitch center, while the listeners naturally<br/>perceive the pitch as in the center of the pitch modulations.  This<br/>is one of the most subtle and difficult pitch problems to cure, and<br/>worse, often involves painstakingly working through a lot of ego<br/>investment on the part of the singer!</p><p>Thanks again for your input, everyone!
