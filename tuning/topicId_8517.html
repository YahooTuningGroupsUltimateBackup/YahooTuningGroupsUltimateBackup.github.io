Suddenly we<br/>heard this amazing blues pattern coming from one of the amps.<br/>&quot;Hey man, this is a great guitar&quot;.<br/>The player was obviously drunk, had picked up one of the guitars and<br/>without realising that it had 25 frets per octave, had just played it<br/>guided by the dots on the edge of the fretboard, and<br/>his very experienced ears.</p><p>I have found that by leaving harmonic landmarks, in the form of dots;<br/>(i.e. at bIII, IV, V, VI and Octave positions), novices can immediately<br/>navigate, the fretboard.<br/>With LucyTuned fretboards, the complication of sharp and flat keys is<br/>easily solved for the &quot;double&quot; frets.<br/>If you want to play the sharps, play &quot;on the pair&quot;; for flats play<br/>&quot;below the pair&quot;.</p><p>I hope these observations help the fretboard designers and demonstrators<br/>to make<br/>microtonal fretboards more accessible to newbies.</p><p>--<br/>~===============================================================~<br/>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@ilhawaii.net">lucy@ilhawaii.net</a>  (LucyScaleDevelopments)<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>by setting tuning and harmonic standards for the next 1000 years (and<br/>beyond),<br/>                       and having fun with them.</p><p>                  for information on LucyTuning<br/>                  See <a href="http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy">http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy</a><br/>                  or <a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a></p></div><h3><a id=8523 href="#8523">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2000 8:51:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles Lucy wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have found that by leaving harmonic landmarks, in the form of dots;<br/>&gt; (i.e. at bIII, IV, V, VI and Octave positions), novices can immediately<br/>&gt; navigate, the fretboard.<br/>&gt; With LucyTuned fretboards, the complication of sharp and flat keys is<br/>&gt; easily solved for the &quot;double&quot; frets.<br/>&gt; If you want to play the sharps, play &quot;on the pair&quot;; for flats play<br/>&gt; &quot;below the pair&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope these observations help the fretboard designers and demonstrators<br/>&gt; to make microtonal fretboards more accessible to newbies.</p><p>Naturally the FreeNote G&amp;Ls are like that. Even though<br/>I&apos;ve found that dots on the side of the fretless fingerboard<br/>are enough, requests for fret markers are a common request.</p><p>At NAMM, I stopped by and checked out the French Viger company.<br/>They have a fretless with a metal alloy fingerboard that costs<br/>and weighs about twice as much as our G&amp;L fretless. Of course<br/>a metal fingerboard sounds different than the wood/epoxy fingerboard.<br/>Lots of fun to play, they not only have dots on the side of the<br/>fingerboard,<br/>but markers for 12tet frets (also n the side of the fingerboard).<br/>A bit pricey ($2400!) though.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
