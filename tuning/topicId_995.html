Now this may be significant in its &gt;relationship with other notes<br/>of the scale but when played with the 1/1 it is surely more significant<br/>that this is 7/5 &gt;+7.7c.</p><p>Dave, I strongly believe this 45/32 is only significant in its<br/>relationship with the other notes in the scale. It is a 5:4 above the<br/>9/8. Played alone wih the 1/1, it certainly evokes a 7/5 harmonically.<br/>It also has purely melodic significance which doesn&apos;t depend as much on<br/>tuning.</p><p>&gt;I understand there is a kind of &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; built into<br/>Fourier (or Laplace or wavelet) analysis and &gt;presumably also into<br/>whatever the ear+brain does. You can&apos;t give a definite frequency to any<br/>wave that you only &gt;sample for a finite duration. The shorter it lasts,<br/>the greater the uncertainty in its frequency. delta_f = 1/delta_t. So<br/>&gt;if a chord only lasts for a second it&apos;s impossible to say whether it<br/>had zero beats. It might have had a beat slower &gt;than one per second and<br/>you wouldn&apos;t (couldn&apos;t?) notice it.</p><p>Absolutely. I&apos;ve even read that the ear+brain will adjust its sampling<br/>duration depending on the type of music (or speech) being played, in<br/>order to extract more information than a fixed sampling duration would<br/>allow.</p><p>&gt;For example, Jazz appears to me to use 12-tET as if it were<br/>approximating ratios of 7 (among others). 12-tET is &gt;very poor at this<br/>(up to 31 cent errors) but long sustained chords are notably absent from<br/>Jazz, so it &quot;works&quot;. I&apos;m &gt;sure people can train themselves to recognise<br/>more complex ratios, but there will still be some limit on the<br/>&gt;complexity, and I see no way around requiring a longer time to do the<br/>recognition.</p><p>This is why LaMonte Young keeps his high-limit chords going for minutes<br/>or hours! (Not that I totally disagree with your skepticism of the very<br/>high numbers he uses.)</p></div><h3><a id=8314 href="#8314">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/6/2000 1:36:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave -- those chords are two-dimensional if you adopt a 7-limit standard of<br/>consonance. The 7:9 and 5:9 interval classes are, I feel, noticeably more<br/>dissonant than 4:7 and 6:7. So it&apos;s meaningful to draw the line between<br/>consonance and dissonance between the ratios of 7 and ratios of 9 if one wishes.<br/>Of course, it could be just as meaningful to adopt a 9-limit standard of<br/>consonance, if a particular musical piece, composer, or style warrants it.</p><p>So I misunderstood you on the tetrahedron issue. Thanks for clarifying.</p></div>
