Too many numbers, not nearly enough music. While this works<br/>for some, it doesn&apos;t for me. However, just before I vacate the premises,<br/>I&apos;d like to solicit opinions and ideas regarding a basic background on<br/>Harry Partch&apos;s theory and practice of just intonation. What I would like to<br/>know is:</p><p>If you were to construct a basic FAQ page regarding JI, *especially* as it<br/>related to Partch&apos;s work, what would be the shortest list of topics you<br/>feel it would require to be a valid resource?</p><p>I have long abstained from putting direct information on Corporeal Meadows<br/>about the use of JI in Partch&apos;s music (preferring instead to point to other<br/>sites that were intonation-centric), but I feel it is time to have at least<br/>a &apos;Beginner&apos;s Guide&apos; to Just Intonation. While I want it to be brief, and<br/>still give resources for those that wish more depth, I do not want to gloss<br/>over what *this* (the tuning list) community would consider the essentials.<br/>During the years of working with both Harry and the ensemble, I might have<br/>taken the theoretical aspects a little for granted, as they were in my ears<br/>most all of the time. Now, however, I feel a need to assist those who might<br/>be new to this particular corner of music/art/ritual, and I want to proceed<br/>appropriately.</p><p>Feel free to write me off-list, but I&apos;ll still continue my list<br/>subscription until it looks like responses have dried up (if you feel<br/>others would find them of interest). I&apos;d also like to take this opportunity<br/>to publicly thank the many fine people who have posted here for a wealth of<br/>learning and sharing, and I wish you all the best of intonational systems,<br/>in whatever form you find/create them.</p><p>Warmly,<br/>Jon<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.

I feel that most theorists misinterpret Partch and<br/>would love to do my part in helping people understand the ideas of a man<br/>who really _listened_. Where Partch contradicted himself, it was in<br/>theoretical areas rather removed from the actual experience of<br/>listening, tuning, and hearing consonance and dissonance. When the<br/>latter is taken as the foundation, many of the contradictions can be<br/>resolved, I feel.</p></div>
