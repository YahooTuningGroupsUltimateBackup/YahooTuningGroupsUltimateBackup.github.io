The model in question<br/>&gt;does not assume octave-equivalence. This<br/>&gt;seems to agree well with experience -- for<br/>&gt;example, 7:3 is more concordant than 7:6<br/>&gt;which is more concordant than 12:7.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>Now I have a much better idea what you are getting at!</p><p>....</p><p>Robert</p></div>
