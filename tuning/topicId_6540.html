And in the giant<br/>beating &quot;chords&quot; and other beautiful things of the playback, I was<br/>*totally* hooked (I still have these on cassette somewhere)... and<br/>though it would take quite awhile to &quot;officially&quot; go &quot;microtonal,&quot;<br/>from that time on I was DEFINITELY into it (I just didn&apos;t know what<br/>&quot;it&quot; was yet)... Over the years I&apos;ve had a ton of (microtonal)<br/>stuff/instruments, but every move seems to lop of a pile of these<br/>(mostly the sub-EMI) things. Anyway, here&apos;s a list of what I got<br/>now...</p><p>A fretless (Les Paul copy) with and aluminum fingerboard (made by Rick<br/>Canton)... a 20e electric (fretted by Glen Nelson with banjo<br/>fretwire)... a Kramer fretless electric... a 13e (3/4 size) steel<br/>string acoustic... a (no-name) fretless bass... a fretless baritone<br/>ukulele... a Proteus FX... a (real piece of s---) Casio CZ-101 and a<br/>Roland MT-32...</p><p>These are instruments (or not-instruments...) that are (more or less)<br/>unintentionally &quot;microtonal&quot;...</p><p>An astonishingly &quot;out of tune&quot; Magnus organ... and by way of<br/>attempting to force my turntable to do things it wasn&apos;t designed to<br/>like, it is now a permanent source of (illness inducing) microtonal<br/>portamento (and in all seriousness, anything that you can take a real<br/>hands on approach to varying the pitch of I love and find quite<br/>&quot;microtonally&quot; useful, and turntables and tape decks are definitely<br/>two of my faves in this area)... my old Alesis HR-16:B drum machine<br/>(somewhat mysteriously as no one at Alesis would either confirm or<br/>deny this) has voices tuned in groups of overtone octaves (the<br/>incremental pitch numbers on the Alesis are arranged in a number line<br/>from -16 through +15, and the &quot;pipe&quot; voice for instance corresponds to<br/>harmonics 16 through 47, giving eight complete octaves at 16 through<br/>23, and a ninth that abruptly stops at 47/24)... and I still have my<br/>sisters old grade school Bundy Bb (a whole world of microtonal<br/>potential is to be found in very &quot;simple&quot; things -- like the whammy<br/>bar and the whammy pedal, a slide or the tuning pegs, your embouchure<br/>and your fingers, etc., etc. -- and is right there for the taking with<br/>regular old twelve-tone instruments)...</p><p>Dan</p><p>- oh yeah, even though I have had to abandon many of them, I still do<br/>have a pretty good pile of (pathetically poor workmanship) homemades.</p></div>
