Here I will take Bb* as Rast, although that may be an<br/>arbitrary choice.</p><p>Anyway, in the 79-MOS, I gather from some of the previous articles<br/>that this would be a good Suz-i Dilara:</p><p>! 79MOS_Suz-i_Dilara.scl<br/>!<br/>Tuning for Suz-i Dilara in Ozan Yarman&apos;s 79MOS<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 211.23644<br/> 422.92728<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 913.19144<br/> 1124.01947<br/> 2/1</p><p>In terms of the chain of fifths, this would be approximately:</p><p>  F--(702)--C--(702)--G--(709)--D--(702)--A--(710)--E--(702)--B<br/> 498        0        702       211       913       422       1124</p><p>Let&apos;s assume that the major third step of this scale up from the 1/1<br/>should be somewhere around 14/11 (418 cents) or 23/18 (424 cents), and<br/>thus not too far from the region of maximum complexity between 5:4 and<br/>9:7 at roughly 422-423 cents.</p><p>In Zest-24, the following two tunings of Suz-i Dilara are closest to<br/>the above version in the 79MOS, and are found on Gb* or Ab* -- if Bb*<br/>is Rast, then these steps would be approximately Bayyati (778 cents)<br/>and Ajem (983 cents).</p><p>! zest24_Suz-i_Dilara_Gbup.scl<br/>!<br/>Zest-24 Suz-i Dilara near suggested values in Ozan Yarman&apos;s 79MOS<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 203.90624<br/> 421.87500<br/> 505.07812<br/> 696.09374<br/> 912.89062<br/> 1129.68749<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here the scheme of fifths is approximately:</p><p> Cb--(695)--Gb--(696)--Db--(708)--Ab--(709)--Eb--(709)--Bb--(708)--F<br/>505         0         696        204        913        422       1130</p><p>Whereas fifths in the 79MOS may be precisely or virtually just, or<br/>else about 1/3 of a Holdrian comma (1/53 octave), or a step of<br/>159-EDO, either narrow or wide, in Zest-24 there are two basic types<br/>of fifths, either narrow or wide by around 1/4 or 3/10 of a<br/>Pythagorean comma (at 695/696 or 708/709 cents). Thus the impurity of<br/>these decidedly tempered fifths is comparable in the two systems: but<br/>the 79MOS, of course, additionally offers the attractions of many just<br/>fifths and fourths.</p><p>Here is a slightly different although comparable version of Suz-i<br/>Dilara on Ab*, or a 982-cent seventh (almost identical to 22-EDO,<br/>about 30/17) above Bb* Rast:</p><p>! zest24_Suz-i_Dilara_Abup.scl<br/>!<br/>Zest-24 Suz-i Dilara similar to tuning in Ozan Yarman&apos;s 79MOS<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 217.96876<br/> 421.87500<br/> 492.18750<br/> 708.98438<br/> 925.78125<br/> 1117.96875<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here is the approximate chain of fifths:</p><p> Db--(708)--Ab--(709)--Eb--(709)--Bb--(708)--F--(696)--C--(696)--G<br/> 492        0         709        218        926       422       1117</p><p>While both of these Zest-24 forms have major thirds around 422 cents,<br/>or within a cent or so of the 79MOS interval of 28 steps, another<br/>option would be to try a septimal flavor with a 434-cent major third<br/>built from four wide fifths, and very close to 9/7. Such a form occurs<br/>on Db*, about 274 cents above Bb* Rast, which might be termed Nerm<br/>Kurdi:</p><p>! zest24_Suz-i_Dilara_Dbup.scl<br/>!<br/>Zest-24 Suz-i Dilara, approximately septimal<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 216.79688<br/> 433.59375<br/> 503.90626<br/> 707.81250<br/> 925.78126<br/> 1129.68750<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here is the approximate chain of fifths:</p><p> Gb--(696)--Db--(708)--Ab--(709)--Eb--(709)--Bb--(708)--F--(696)--C<br/> 504        0         708        217        926        434      1130</p><p>All three Zest-24 versions of Suz-i Dilara, interestingly, are formed<br/>from four wide and two narrow or meantone fifths. There are three<br/>types of major seconds. A meantone at about 191/192 cents results from<br/>two narrow fifths (e.g. F-C-G); a virtually just 9:8 tone at 204 cents<br/>from a narrow plus a wide fifth (e.g. Gb-Db-Ab); and what I might term<br/>a &quot;septimal eventone fifth,&quot; equal to about half of a 9:7 major third,<br/>or 217/218 cents, from two wide fifths (e.g. Eb-Bb-F).</p><p>Note that all these versions of Suz-i Dilara in Zest-24 are formed<br/>from within a single 12-note circle of fifths; the same tunings would<br/>also be available on the lower 12-note circle at Gb, Ab, and Db.</p><p>By comparison, the degree or perde of Bb* Rast itself has something<br/>like the understanding of Maqam Rast as either a mode with small major<br/>third and seventh around 5:4 and 15:8, or a mode with a middling to<br/>large neutral third plus a neutral sixth (in a Zalzalian form) or<br/>neutral seventh (in a common modern form).</p><p>1.

The larger size and greater versatility of the 79MOS<br/>obviously have their advantages.</p><p>Interestingly, the step Gb*, or Perde Bayyati if Bb* is Rast, has not<br/>only the Suz-i Dilara shown above with a 422-cent major third, but<br/>also an interesting form of Maqam Rast:</p><p>        Rast                  Rast<br/> |----------------|    |---------------|<br/> Gb*   Ab*  Bb   Cb*   Db*   Eb*   F   Gb*<br/> 0    204  371   504  696    913 1079 1200</p><p>        Rast            Rast<br/> |----------------|---------------|<br/> Gb*   Ab*  Bb   Cb*   Db*   Eb   Fb*   Gb*<br/> 0    204  371   504  696   862  1009  1200</p><p>These forms have a large neutral third around 26/21, and might be<br/>styled &quot;submajor,&quot; a term which also fits the large neutral sixth at<br/>around 862 or 863 cents in the &quot;Zalzalian&quot; form, say 28/17.</p><p>Anyway, the submajor flavor of Rast provides a way to have both this<br/>Maqam and Suz-i Dilara on the same final step -- although here two<br/>circles of fifths are obviously involved.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77993 href="#77993">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2008 3:30:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone.</p><p>Please let me attempt a response to the question about ratios of<br/>factors such as 11 and 13 in &quot;extended JI&quot; from two perspectives. My<br/>first perspective will be simply to urge that these intervals occur in<br/>a variety of world musics, for example Near East maqam and dastgah<br/>music of the Arab world, Turkey, Kurdistan, and Iran, where they have<br/>been recognized in the theoretical literature for a millennium or<br/>more. They are useful, practical, and beautiful -- whether presented<br/>in JI, in a &quot;near-JI&quot; system like George Secor&apos;s HTT-29, or in more<br/>decidedly tempered systems.</p><p>A different perspective is to point out also that Secor and others<br/>have used these ratios more specifically in what I suspect is meant by<br/>an &quot;extended JI&quot; style: one with very thickly saturated sonorities<br/>like 4:5:6:7:9:11:13:15 (which HTT-29 very closely approximates),<br/>and/or taking advantage of the special properties of isoharmonic<br/>chords or sonorities like 9:11:13:15:17. While this level of density<br/>is a bit different than my normal style, so is Wagner, for example --<br/>and this kind of &quot;extended&quot; sonority offers a kind of 21st-century<br/>complexity which needs neither simply to recaptulate nor laboriously<br/>to avoid previous Western Europe practice, for those who come from<br/>this tradition.</p><p>What I would like to urge strongly is that &quot;ratios of 11, 13, etc.&quot;<br/>can occur in many kinds of texture, ranging from a single melodic line<br/>of traditional maqam or Persian dastgah music, to counterpoint for two<br/>or three voices, to the thicker and denser textures which &quot;extended<br/>JI&quot; might suggest, at least in my interpretation above. Many of these<br/>applications are available with tunings of quite modest sizes, for<br/>example a pentatonic or heptatonic mode.</p><p>Consider this beautiful tuning of Ibn Sina (980-1037), known in the<br/>Latin west as Avicenna (Scala archive, avicenna_diat.scl):</p><p>         1/1   14/13  7/6  4/3  3/2  21/13  7/4   2/1<br/>          0     128   267  498  702   830   969   1200</p><p>This set calls for only seven notes, and should be readily<br/>recognizable without the listener being puzzled by too many steps for<br/>a clear melodic pattern. An interesting point which I find has been<br/>noted by Cris Forster on this newsgroup, and fits my own nonnative<br/>intuitions, is that Ibn Sina&apos;s prominent use of small neutral or<br/>middle intervals such as the 14:13 second and the 21:13 sixth could<br/>quite possibly represent then, as now, a regional preference among<br/>Persian and Kurdish musicians somewhat distinct from the taste in much<br/>of the Arab world, for example, for rather larger sizes for these<br/>intervals above the resting note or _Qarar_ (in European terms, the<br/>&quot;final&quot; or &quot;tonic&quot;).</p><p>Of course, as Ozan Yarman would have me emphasize, and I will do so<br/>with a friendly amendment or two, neither European modality nor the<br/>Near Eastern maqam and dastgah systems confine themselves to the<br/>&quot;textbook&quot; heptatonic forms often cited for the various modes. Shifts<br/>in the perceived modal center in a given passage or section of music,<br/>customary inflections, and mutations or modulations from one mode to<br/>another are characteristic of maqam and dastgah music as well as<br/>14th-17th century European modal styles and 18th-19th century<br/>tonality. However, it is eminently possible to use ratios of 11 and 13<br/>in such a way that a given set of around seven notes is a salient<br/>aural focus at a given time, sometimes with subtle inflections or<br/>touches of &quot;color&quot; which decorate, but do not unduly obscure, the<br/>prevailing pattern.</p><p>In a fascinating dialogue which took place in this forum, George Secor<br/>recounted some of his experiments with a 17-tone well-temperament (his<br/>17-WT of 1978), and Ozan Yarman remarked that someone exploring this<br/>material (or its JI equivalent, as George suggests in a superb essay I<br/>will offer a link to below) would likely discover or rediscover some<br/>of the patterns of maqam music. Those posts moved me again to review<br/>George&apos;s article published in _Xenharmonikon_ 18, where I noted indeed<br/>that some of his scales involving ratios of 11 and 13 either match or<br/>appear as logical variations from popular maqamat (plural of _maqam_)<br/>in the medieval or modern tradition. Here is a link to this article,<br/>and also to a version of a companion article appearing in the same<br/>issue which I wrote with his invaluable collaboration and mentorship:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip</a>&gt;</p><p>It may also be useful briefly to note that while medieval Near Eastern<br/>theory often specifies just ratios such as 14:13 or 13:12 or 12:11,<br/>performers may often touch on or near these ratios without a specific<br/>theoretical intent to do so. Also, performers may be in search of a<br/>general type of color or nuance rather than any precise integer<br/>ratio. For example, as someone often oriented toward rational ratios,<br/>I may say to myself, &quot;a tuning of around 1/1-13/12-13/11-4/3 is a good<br/>one for a tetrachord of Arab Bayyati or Persian Daramad Shur&quot; -- that<br/>is, around 0-139-289-498 cents -- but this is merely one convenient<br/>shade of intonation. In tuning systems I use, we might get these just<br/>values (Zephyr 24, JOT-17); near-just ones of 0-138-288-496 cents<br/>(Peppermint 24); or ones &quot;in the general vicinity,&quot; say something like<br/>0-141-287-503 cents (Zest-24).</p><p>The tetrachord described by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi in the 13th century<br/>of 64:59:54:48 or 1/1-64/59-32/27-4/3 or 0-141-294-498 cents (Scala<br/>archive, safi_diat2.scl) seems equally characteristic of Bayyati or<br/>Shur -- so that a certain region of the spectrum, rather than specific<br/>qualities of &quot;11-ness&quot; or &quot;13-ness,&quot; may be the main point, although<br/>Safi al-Din and others take a great interest in tunings built from<br/>superparticular ratios, thus following the tradition of Ptolemy and<br/>adapting it to Islamic civilization.</p><p>Anyway, to sum up, I would emphasize two points. The first is that any<br/>musical style or tradition which favors neutral intervals is quite<br/>likely either deliberately or otherwise to use or approximate ratios<br/>such as 13/12, 17/14, 11/9, 21/13, 13/8, 18/11, 11/6, 13/7, etc. --<br/>whether the tuning is based on rational ratios, a fixed irrational<br/>temperament, or the intuition of flexible-pitch performers. This is<br/>not something new or radical or of questionable practicality: in<br/>theory and practice, it&apos;s been a basic feature of maqam music for a<br/>millennium and more.</p><p>As for the use of &quot;dense&quot; (e.g. complex isoharmonic) sonorities in<br/>what I suspect could be meant by an &quot;extended JI&quot; setting, Secor&apos;s<br/>article nicely covers the potentials both in JI or near-JI tunings,<br/>and in not-quite-so-accurate tempered systems. Indeed, I would<br/>recommend his essay as an ideal introduction to the subject, whether<br/>from the standpoint of musical motivations or real-world practice.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77999 href="#77999">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2008 11:30:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  One of the most obvious harmonic scale constructions using 11/8 and<br/>&gt;  13/8 is: 0-204-345-551-702-841-1049-1200.

Similarly, my view of 12-note &quot;circulating&quot; systems<br/>(meaning simply &quot;with all 12 fifths within 1/3-comma or so of 3/2 in<br/>one direction or the other&quot;) is rather specialized, and not ideally<br/>adapted to judging the fine points of most efforts more or less along<br/>historical lines. Andreas, I apologize for not offering more feedback<br/>to some of your tunings: I suspect that George could give a better<br/>critique, and one from a most experienced and versatile designer.</p><p>What I can tell you is an amusing story about an attempt I made at a<br/>variation on George&apos;s HTT-29, one which as it developed, didn&apos;t really<br/>meet my own criteria, let alone George&apos;s. He was tactful and effective<br/>in communicating this. The result was that I turned to the idea of a<br/>new 24-note tuning, and rapidly arrived at Zest-24. There I may have<br/>some competence at least in explaining the purposes of the tuning,<br/>however debatable the intonational results might be.</p><p>To conclude, I might say that two factors could lead to HTT-29, your<br/>29-note system, Andreas, or other alternatives. The first is a<br/>person&apos;s sense of acoustics and fine nuances: for example, the<br/>deliberate tempering in HTT-29 of some just ratios by minute<br/>quantities not as a compromise, but as an optimization of sound. The<br/>second is the radically different stylistic assumptions that can apply<br/>for people discussing the same ratios and in agreement as to the<br/>mathematics involved.</p><p>Also, of course, there&apos;s room for more than one tuning in a given<br/>genre. Thus when encountering and exploring George&apos;s 17-WT, I rapidly<br/>agreed that it was the best such system of which I was aware. Yet my<br/>own 17-note circulating system, which I arrived at in 2000 without<br/>then knowing that George had done his in 1978, has its own qualities;<br/>and the two illustrate some possible approaches to the terms of the<br/>problem.</p><p>It is an agreeable aspect of the world of tunings that solutions<br/>are often pleasant, sometimes outstanding, but rarely exhaustive.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=78005 href="#78005">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2008 1:49:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Erv Wilson did quite a bit of work playing with dual Harmonic series which can be seen here. over these very pitch basis<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/hel.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/hel.PDF</a><br/>actually it is a process he much prefers to the diamond, or has at times where he has recommending it being in pairs.

As it happened, starting from Eb on the lower keyboard<br/>yielded the best approximations for most of these ratios, so I arrived<br/>at this scheme for a 17-note &quot;Quasi-Evangelina&quot; subset offering a<br/>tempered variation on the upper and middle ranks of notes on Erv&apos;s<br/>instrument:</p><p>       146        338         541                843         1034<br/>        E*        Gb*         Ab*               Cb*/B*        Db*</p><p>Eb  Fb/E   F    F*    G    Ab    A/Bbb   Bb   Cb/B    C     C*     D     Eb<br/>0    96   217  267   409   491    600    709   792   913   963   1104   1200</p><p>Of course, apart from the impurity of the fifths and fourths and the<br/>presence of a number of narrowed meantone major seconds (Kraig, I can<br/>hardly omit a fair mention of that!), there are some shifts in color<br/>from the classic balance of the Evangelina tuning. Thus E* at 146<br/>cents is rather higher than 13/12 (139 cents), while Gb* at 338 cents<br/>is notably lower than 11/9, and closer for example to the kind of<br/>17/14 or 243/200 color (around 336-337 cents) typical of Persian<br/>music. The &quot;superfourth&quot; or small diminished fifth Eb-Ab* at 541 cents<br/>is actually closer to 15/11 than to 11/8, while Db* at 1034 cents is a<br/>virtually just 20/11 rather than an 11/6.</p><p>Of course, the tempered variation is no substitute for the just<br/>original, only a modest attempt at a tribute to Erv&apos;s craft and<br/>influence.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=78067 href="#78067">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2008 8:15:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Robert, and all.</p><p>Thank you for this wonderful list of tetrachords, which I&apos;ve been<br/>having fun with at the keyboard by looking for reasonably close<br/>approximations in the Zest-24 temperament.

Instead, we ought to use Mahur, which is mostly a mixture of Pythagorean major on perde rast with Rast (which is naturally on perde rast). Thus, all instances of Suz-i Dilara should be replaced with Mahur. While AEU tends to Mahurize Chargah by converting the original Chargah to a Pythagorean major on perde kaba (sub) chargah, I find it synthetic and dismiss it entirely while staying true to the original.

There are three<br/>&gt; types of major seconds. A meantone at about 191/192 cents results from<br/>&gt; two narrow fifths (e.g. F-C-G); a virtually just 9:8 tone at 204 cents<br/>&gt; from a narrow plus a wide fifth (e.g. Gb-Db-Ab); and what I might term<br/>&gt; a &quot;septimal eventone fifth,&quot; equal to about half of a 9:7 major third,<br/>&gt; or 217/218 cents, from two wide fifths (e.g. Eb-Bb-F).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that all these versions of Suz-i Dilara in Zest-24 are formed<br/>&gt; from within a single 12-note circle of fifths; the same tunings would<br/>&gt; also be available on the lower 12-note circle at Gb, Ab, and Db.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Admirably done. Congratulations!</p><p>&gt; By comparison, the degree or perde of Bb* Rast itself has something<br/>&gt; like the understanding of Maqam Rast as either a mode with small major<br/>&gt; third and seventh around 5:4 and 15:8, or a mode with a middling to<br/>&gt; large neutral third plus a neutral sixth (in a Zalzalian form) or<br/>&gt; neutral seventh (in a common modern form).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

My<br/>&gt; first perspective will be simply to urge that these intervals occur in<br/>&gt; a variety of world musics, for example Near East maqam and dastgah<br/>&gt; music of the Arab world, Turkey, Kurdistan, and Iran, where they have<br/>&gt; been recognized in the theoretical literature for a millennium or<br/>&gt; more. They are useful, practical, and beautiful -- whether presented<br/>&gt; in JI, in a &quot;near-JI&quot; system like George Secor&apos;s HTT-29, or in more<br/>&gt; decidedly tempered systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A different perspective is to point out also that Secor and others<br/>&gt; have used these ratios more specifically in what I suspect is meant by<br/>&gt; an &quot;extended JI&quot; style: one with very thickly saturated sonorities<br/>&gt; like 4:5:6:7:9:11:13:15 (which HTT-29 very closely approximates),<br/>&gt; and/or taking advantage of the special properties of isoharmonic<br/>&gt; chords or sonorities like 9:11:13:15:17. While this level of density<br/>&gt; is a bit different than my normal style, so is Wagner, for example --<br/>&gt; and this kind of &quot;extended&quot; sonority offers a kind of 21st-century<br/>&gt; complexity which needs neither simply to recaptulate nor laboriously<br/>&gt; to avoid previous Western Europe practice, for those who come from<br/>&gt; this tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I would like to urge strongly is that &quot;ratios of 11, 13, etc.&quot;<br/>&gt; can occur in many kinds of texture, ranging from a single melodic line<br/>&gt; of traditional maqam or Persian dastgah music, to counterpoint for two<br/>&gt; or three voices, to the thicker and denser textures which &quot;extended<br/>&gt; JI&quot; might suggest, at least in my interpretation above. Many of these<br/>&gt; applications are available with tunings of quite modest sizes, for<br/>&gt; example a pentatonic or heptatonic mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider this beautiful tuning of Ibn Sina (980-1037), known in the<br/>&gt; Latin west as Avicenna (Scala archive, avicenna_diat.scl):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         1/1   14/13  7/6  4/3  3/2  21/13  7/4   2/1<br/>&gt;          0     128   267  498  702   830   969   1200<br/>&gt;</p><p>This scale seems to be constructed from the disjunct union of two permuted kavi (tense diatonic?) genera I mentioned earlier. Remember that the original kavi genus was 12:13:14:16.</p><p>&gt; This set calls for only seven notes, and should be readily<br/>&gt; recognizable without the listener being puzzled by too many steps for<br/>&gt; a clear melodic pattern. An interesting point which I find has been<br/>&gt; noted by Cris Forster on this newsgroup, and fits my own nonnative<br/>&gt; intuitions, is that Ibn Sina&apos;s prominent use of small neutral or<br/>&gt; middle intervals such as the 14:13 second and the 21:13 sixth could<br/>&gt; quite possibly represent then, as now, a regional preference among<br/>&gt; Persian and Kurdish musicians somewhat distinct from the taste in much<br/>&gt; of the Arab world, for example, for rather larger sizes for these<br/>&gt; intervals above the resting note or _Qarar_ (in European terms, the<br/>&gt; &quot;final&quot; or &quot;tonic&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, as Ozan Yarman would have me emphasize, and I will do so<br/>&gt; with a friendly amendment or two, neither European modality nor the<br/>&gt; Near Eastern maqam and dastgah systems confine themselves to the<br/>&gt; &quot;textbook&quot; heptatonic forms often cited for the various modes. Shifts<br/>&gt; in the perceived modal center in a given passage or section of music,<br/>&gt; customary inflections, and mutations or modulations from one mode to<br/>&gt; another are characteristic of maqam and dastgah music as well as<br/>&gt; 14th-17th century European modal styles and 18th-19th century<br/>&gt; tonality. However, it is eminently possible to use ratios of 11 and 13<br/>&gt; in such a way that a given set of around seven notes is a salient<br/>&gt; aural focus at a given time, sometimes with subtle inflections or<br/>&gt; touches of &quot;color&quot; which decorate, but do not unduly obscure, the<br/>&gt; prevailing pattern.</p><p>Righteously!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a fascinating dialogue which took place in this forum, George Secor<br/>&gt; recounted some of his experiments with a 17-tone well-temperament (his<br/>&gt; 17-WT of 1978), and Ozan Yarman remarked that someone exploring this<br/>&gt; material (or its JI equivalent, as George suggests in a superb essay I<br/>&gt; will offer a link to below) would likely discover or rediscover some<br/>&gt; of the patterns of maqam music. Those posts moved me again to review<br/>&gt; George&apos;s article published in _Xenharmonikon_ 18, where I noted indeed<br/>&gt; that some of his scales involving ratios of 11 and 13 either match or<br/>&gt; appear as logical variations from popular maqamat (plural of _maqam_)<br/>&gt; in the medieval or modern tradition. Here is a link to this article,<br/>&gt; and also to a version of a companion article appearing in the same<br/>&gt; issue which I wrote with his invaluable collaboration and mentorship:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I had the oppurtunity to skim through the Xenharmonikon article of George Secor. I am saddened by the fact that he considers better melodic intervals those where the semitones are narrowed to 70 cents or so. This is a prejudice. In Turkish maqam music, which is totally a melodic genre by the way, the better melodic intervals are those where the semitone is an apatome or greater.</p><p>&gt; It may also be useful briefly to note that while medieval Near Eastern<br/>&gt; theory often specifies just ratios such as 14:13 or 13:12 or 12:11,<br/>&gt; performers may often touch on or near these ratios without a specific<br/>&gt; theoretical intent to do so. Also, performers may be in search of a<br/>&gt; general type of color or nuance rather than any precise integer<br/>&gt; ratio. For example, as someone often oriented toward rational ratios,<br/>&gt; I may say to myself, &quot;a tuning of around 1/1-13/12-13/11-4/3 is a good<br/>&gt; one for a tetrachord of Arab Bayyati or Persian Daramad Shur&quot; -- that<br/>&gt; is, around 0-139-289-498 cents -- but this is merely one convenient<br/>&gt; shade of intonation. In tuning systems I use, we might get these just<br/>&gt; values (Zephyr 24, JOT-17); near-just ones of 0-138-288-496 cents<br/>&gt; (Peppermint 24); or ones &quot;in the general vicinity,&quot; say something like<br/>&gt; 0-141-287-503 cents (Zest-24).<br/>&gt;</p><p>These tetrachords are all very fine for Ushshaq.</p><p>&gt; The tetrachord described by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi in the 13th century<br/>&gt; of 64:59:54:48 or 1/1-64/59-32/27-4/3 or 0-141-294-498 cents (Scala<br/>&gt; archive, safi_diat2.scl) seems equally characteristic of Bayyati or<br/>&gt; Shur -- so that a certain region of the spectrum, rather than specific<br/>&gt; qualities of &quot;11-ness&quot; or &quot;13-ness,&quot; may be the main point, although<br/>&gt; Safi al-Din and others take a great interest in tunings built from<br/>&gt; superparticular ratios, thus following the tradition of Ptolemy and<br/>&gt; adapting it to Islamic civilization.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Admirably too, I might add! As a side note, let me remark that the tetrachord you mention is listed as Class III in the third table on Kavi (tense or even diatonic) genera based on the subtraction of 9:8 from 4:3 and the division of 32:27 to two equal parts. This could be interpreted as an Ushshaq if read the way you have specified or a Rast if read the other way around (48:54:59:64).</p><p>&gt; Anyway, to sum up, I would emphasize two points. The first is that any<br/>&gt; musical style or tradition which favors neutral intervals is quite<br/>&gt; likely either deliberately or otherwise to use or approximate ratios<br/>&gt; such as 13/12, 17/14, 11/9, 21/13, 13/8, 18/11, 11/6, 13/7, etc. --<br/>&gt; whether the tuning is based on rational ratios, a fixed irrational<br/>&gt; temperament, or the intuition of flexible-pitch performers. This is<br/>&gt; not something new or radical or of questionable practicality: in<br/>&gt; theory and practice, it&apos;s been a basic feature of maqam music for a<br/>&gt; millennium and more.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very well put Margo.</p><p>&gt; As for the use of &quot;dense&quot; (e.g. complex isoharmonic) sonorities in<br/>&gt; what I suspect could be meant by an &quot;extended JI&quot; setting, Secor&apos;s<br/>&gt; article nicely covers the potentials both in JI or near-JI tunings,<br/>&gt; and in not-quite-so-accurate tempered systems. Indeed, I would<br/>&gt; recommend his essay as an ideal introduction to the subject, whether<br/>&gt; from the standpoint of musical motivations or real-world practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=78104 href="#78104">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2008 10:21:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, the Yarman24 rendition of maqam Segah would be:</p><p>  0:          1/1               &#x9;&#x9;0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         16/15            &#x9;&#x9;111.731 minor diatonic semitone<br/>  2:          6/5             &#x9;&#x9;315.641 minor third<br/>  3:        501.956 cents     &#x9;501.956<br/>  4:          3/2             &#x9;&#x9;701.955 perfect fifth<br/>  5:          8/5             &#x9;&#x9;813.686 minor sixth<br/>  6:          9/5            &#x9;&#x9;1017.596 just minor seventh, BP seventh<br/>  7:       1105.866 cents    &#x9;1105.866<br/>  8:          2/1            &#x9;&#x9;1200.000 octave</p><p>Bear in mind that the 0th step is perde segah, which is 5/4 of Yarman24:</p><p>  0:          1/1               &#x9;&#x9;0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         84.360 cents      &#x9;84.360<br/>  2:         38/35            &#x9;&#x9;142.373<br/>  3:        192.180 cents     &#x9;192.180<br/>  4:          9/8             &#x9;&#x9;203.910 major whole tone<br/>  5:        292.180 cents     &#x9;292.180<br/>  6:         17/14            &#x9;&#x9;336.130 supraminor third<br/>  7:         16/13            &#x9;&#x9;359.472 tridecimal neutral third<br/>  8:          5/4             &#x9;&#x9;386.314 major third<br/>  9:         19/15            &#x9;&#x9;409.244 undevicesimal ditone<br/> 10:          4/3             &#x9;&#x9;498.045 perfect fourth<br/> 11:        584.079 cents     &#x9;584.079<br/> 12:         36/25            &#x9;&#x9;631.283 classic diminished fifth<br/> 13:        696.090 cents     &#x9;696.090<br/> 14:          3/2             &#x9;&#x9;701.955 perfect fifth<br/> 15:        788.270 cents     &#x9;788.270<br/> 16:         18/11            &#x9;&#x9;852.592 undecimal neutral sixth<br/> 17:        888.270 cents     &#x9;888.270<br/> 18:         27/16           &#x9; &#x9;905.865 Pythagorean major sixth<br/> 19:         16/9             &#x9;&#x9;996.090 Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 20:         20/11           &#x9;&#x9;1034.996 large minor seventh<br/> 21:         13/7            &#x9;&#x9;1071.702 16/3-tone<br/> 22:         15/8            &#x9;&#x9;1088.269 classic major seventh<br/> 23:         21/11           &#x9;&#x9;1119.463 undecimal major seventh<br/> 24:          2/1            &#x9;&#x9;1200.000 octave</p><p>Oz.</p><p>On Jul 25, 2008, at 9:30 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One of the most obvious harmonic scale constructions using 11/8 and<br/>&gt;&gt; 13/8 is: 0-204-345-551-702-841-1049-1200.

I have been enjoying a well-<br/>&gt; earned summer&apos;s rest. I hope the importance of the topic has not<br/>&gt; faded while I was away. My comments are below:</p><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Please let me say that no apologies are needed, and that I am<br/>delighted that you have been enjoying your summer after writing such a<br/>germinal dissertation! Of course, the topic is as exciting for me as<br/>ever, and exploring the curious tuning that I give below and some Arab<br/>maqam theory, as well as your papers on your website, has heightened<br/>that interest yet more.</p><p>And so we return to our discussion of Dariush Anooshfar&apos;s<br/>iran_diat.scl in the Scala archives, offered as an interpretation of<br/>an unspecified tuning of Safi al-Din al-Urmavi in the later 13th<br/>century.</p><p>Please let me apologize in advance for trimming a bit: I&apos;ve tried to<br/>edit mainly my own remarks, or passages where we are agreeing on<br/>things already said in previous discussions.</p><p>&gt; Ah, I am sad to say that the Scala 125-EDO subset does great injustice<br/>&gt; to the original Ushshaq scale of Urmavi, which I believe goes:</p><p>&gt; 9:8 x 9:8 x 256:243 x 9:8 x 9:8 x 256:243 x 9:8</p><p>&gt; Notice how the limma has been reduced in size by half in the Scala<br/>&gt; file so as to destroy the qualities of the half-tone step, making it<br/>&gt; a quarter-tone step. Bear in mind that this Ushshaq has nothing to<br/>&gt; do with the Ushshaq we perform today. I am at a lost to explain how<br/>&gt; a diatonic major scale got transformed to a neutral minor during the<br/>&gt; centuries that followed Urmavi.</p><p>This looks like a very interesting conversation! This summer I found<br/>on the Web a paper by Dr. Fazli Arslan of the Turkish Ministry of<br/>Education and others, _Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and the Theory of Music_<br/>(March 2007), which leads to the conclusion that Anooshfar might have<br/>had a different tuning of Urmavi in mind -- but first this Ushshaq.</p><p>Certainly we agree that if Anooshfar had intended this tuning, then<br/>his 125-EDO version would seem very curious! I wonder if, instead, he<br/>had this septimal flavor of Urmavi, again with two conjunct<br/>tetrachords plus an upper 9:8 tone, in mind, based on what Urmavi<br/>called &quot;the first conjunct&quot; tetrachord of 8/7x9/8x28/27, to which I<br/>will add an indication of approximate Pythagorean-53 or 53-EDO commas:</p><p>           10    9     3      10      9      3       9<br/>commas:  0    10    19    22       32     41     44      53<br/>        1/1   8/7   9/7   4/3    32/21   12/7   16/9    2/1<br/>cents:   0    231   435   498     729     933    996   1200<br/>           8:7   9:8  28:27   8:7     9:8   28:27   9:8<br/>           231   204   63     231     204     63    204<br/>         |-----------------|----------------------|.....|<br/>             lower jins          upper jins         9:8</p><p>This 0-231-435-498 or 231-204-63 tuning seems to me considerably<br/>closer to Anooshfar&apos;s tetrachord of about 0-221-442-490 or 221-221-48<br/>than Urmavi&apos;s Ushshaq at 0-204-408-498 (or 9-9-4 commas). If we start<br/>from this septimal flavor of Urmavi, then three basic changes might<br/>lead to an interpretation like Anooshfar&apos;s.</p><p>The first change is to use some fifths tempered about 1/3-comma wide,<br/>or fourths 1/3-comma narrow, so that we have Urmavi&apos;s 4/3 placed at<br/>around 491 cents and his 16/9 at around 982 cents -- as in 22-EDO.<br/>The second is a very dramatic narrowing of the original 28:27 step (as<br/>in the diatonic of Archytas, of which Urmavi&apos;s tuning is a<br/>permutation) from 63 cents to 50 cents, a quirk to which both<br/>Anooshfar and I seem curiously attracted &lt;grin&gt;:</p><p>        Bb*   Db    Eb    Eb*     Gb      Ab     Ab*     Bb*<br/>cents:   0    224   441   491     728     932    982    1200<br/>           224   217   50     237     204     50    218<br/>         |-----------------|----------------------|.....|<br/>             lower jins          upper jins         9:8</p><p>To get an approximation of Anooshfar&apos;s 0-221-442-490-710-931-979-1200,<br/>we need additionally to substitute a wide tempered 3/2 for Urmavi&apos;s<br/>32/21, interestingly almost just in the last Zest-24 example at 728<br/>cents:</p><p>        Bb*   Db    Eb    Eb*      F*     Ab     Ab*     Bb*<br/>cents:   0    224   441   491     708     932    982    1200<br/>           224   217   50     217     224     50    218<br/>         |-----------------|----------------------|.....|<br/>             lower jins          upper jins         9:8</p><p>Humorously, I might suggest that my attraction to this Anooshfar<br/>tuning comes from the routine license in Zest-24 of often tempering<br/>28:27 at 50 cents, actually a virtually just 35:34! A milder version<br/>of this license would occur in 22-EDO:</p><p>         C    D    E   F    G     A  Bb     C<br/>cents:   0   218  436 491  709   927 982  1200<br/>          218  218  55   218  218  55  218<br/>         |-------------|--------------|.....|<br/>           lower jins     upper jins    tone</p><p>The liberty involved here could be put another way: Urmavi&apos;s 16/9 is<br/>being tempered with narrow fourths down to something like 982 cents,<br/>which represents both 16/9 and 7/4. Thus his interval 12/7-16/9<br/>becomes something like 12/7-30/17, or about 35:34 -- almost exactly<br/>what it is in Zest-24! If the idea is to get a somewhat less<br/>inaccurate version of Urmavi&apos;s steps, then in Zest-24 we might try:</p><p>         |---------------|---------------|......|<br/>         C     D*   E*   F     G    A*   Bb     C<br/>         0    242  434  504   696  937  996   1200<br/>           242  192   70   192   241  59   204</p><p>Here either 70 cents or 59 cents is a more or less reasonable<br/>approximation of 28:27 -- although not as close as with your 17<br/>perdeler! We have a virtually just 16/9 without any pretensions of<br/>representing 7/4. The 241/242-cent steps are rather wider than 8:7;<br/>but one might argue that getting 28:27 more accurately is most<br/>important if the idea is faithfully to represent Urmavi&apos;s tuning.</p><p>&gt; I should state further, that it is most unfortunate that Turks have<br/>&gt; not written a single academic work on their conception of Maqam<br/>&gt; music for the auspices of the international music community since<br/>&gt; Rauf Yekta. My thesis should serve as a brick that closes the<br/>&gt; centennial gap.</p><p>Yes, and clearly I am encountering a software limitation in<br/>Ghostscript that causes a VMerror (not enough virtual memory) in<br/>processing the file. Obviously it is vital that I find some solution<br/>-- possibly a later version of this software that might handle more<br/>recent PDF files (I tried this some months ago and it solved a problem<br/>with a set of PDF files for John Chalmers&apos; book on tetrachords.)</p><p>This is _my_ problem, not yours, and it&apos;s obvious that I need to<br/>figure out some way of reading and reviewing your dissertation.</p><p>[...]</p><p>[On avoiding the region around 170 cents, or &quot;equitable heptatonic&quot;<br/>close to 7-EDO, in maqam music]</p><p>&gt; Indeed so. I remember having stated the necessity to avoid the<br/>&gt; equitable heptotonic in Yarman24.</p><p>Yes, over the summer I found your 24-note system where you mentioned<br/>this. Personally, I tend to regard a 170-cent step as a &quot;Persian<br/>liberty,&quot; more fitting to a dastgah style than a usual maqam style.<br/>Since it often occurs in a Zest-24 tetrachord like 0-191-333-504 cents<br/>(e.g. C*-D*-E-F*) with steps of 191-141-171 cents, where the small<br/>neutral third around 40:33 would fit a Persian style, this view might<br/>have some connection to Near Eastern practice. An interesting question<br/>is whether a tetrachord like F*-G*-A-Bb* or 0-192-333-492 cents, with<br/>steps of 192-141-159 cents, might fit into an Arab or Turkish maqam<br/>style. You&apos;ve mentioned that these small neutral thirds do occur.</p><p>&gt; One place 26/21 comes up is in Ibn Sina&apos;s 28:26:24:21 tetrachord.</p><p>&gt; I checked Ibn Sina&apos;s passages. The actual tetrachord is given as 8:7<br/>&gt; x 14:13 x 13:12. The tetrachord you have mentioned permutes the last<br/>&gt; two intervals. In the original form, we have 16:13 instead of<br/>&gt; 26:21. But I suspect the tetrachord should be read the other way<br/>&gt; around, which yields 12:13:14:16. Ibn Sina calls this a Kavi genus<br/>&gt; which is of quality and nobility, I am not sure what this<br/>&gt; corresponds to in music theory of the Ancient world. Ibn Sina says<br/>&gt; that this is the genus preferred by Ptolemy.</p><p>This tetrachord comes up in Urmavi also, and the string ratios given<br/>confirm the same order you give for Ibn Sina&apos;s version; Urmavi&apos;s<br/>tuning uses conjunct tetrachords, with a 32/21 above the final, as in<br/>the 8/7x9/8x28/27 tuning discussed above:</p><p>lengths:    64    56   52    48    42    39    36    32<br/>            |----------------|------------------|.....|<br/>           1/1   8/7  16/13 4/3   32/21 64/39 16/9   2/1<br/>            0    231   359  498    729   857   996  1200</p><p>Indeed if read the tetrachord &quot;the other way,&quot; with the string lengths<br/>taken instead as frequencies (to put it in one modern way), we get<br/>12:13:14:16, a tetrachord much favored by George Secor. John Chalmers<br/>has the 28:26:24:21 or 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3 I mentioned above in his<br/>avicenna_diat.scl in the Scala archive; maybe this assumes the common<br/>although not invariable Greek custom of putting the smallest interval<br/>first.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ah, but supraminor thirds are not restricted to Persian music. For<br/>&gt;&gt; you see, they are important flavours in such maqams as Hijaz, Nikriz<br/>&gt;&gt; and Neveser. I admit, though, that Persians are more fond of<br/>&gt;&gt; supraminor seconds compared to middler seconds.</p><p>Might I ask for a few examples of these maqam flavors? I know some<br/>general forms of Hijaz and Nakriz as practiced in some Arab regions,<br/>but have learned that the names and tunings can vary in different<br/>regions. (Suz-i Dilara is a very curious example which I maybe should<br/>save for another post.) Below we discuss this further, and I guess at<br/>possible examples in Hijaz and Ushshaq on Dugah. Nakriz I think of as<br/>a pentachord with a lower tone plus a Hijaz tetrachord, and if I place<br/>this on Neva in Zest-24, then the example might serve our purposes,<br/>with the middle step of the pentachord at 333 cents or 40/33:</p><p>      Neva   Huseyni  Dik Ajem Sehnaz  Muhayyer<br/>       F*       G*       A       B*       C*<br/>       0       192      333     575      696<br/>           192      141     242      121</p><p>I am not sure what Neveser is, and this example would be especially<br/>interesting.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 14:17:21 makes a wonderful neutral chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed!</p><p>&gt; This is a fascinating design: 12 notes from a circulating temperament<br/>&gt; of Rameau, and the other 12 added to provide some delicious Maqam<br/>&gt; flavors!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;[34]<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76333">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76333</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t forget the 17-tone closed cycle achieved via superpythagorean<br/>&gt; fifths for 7-limit major and minor chords!</p><p>Yes! It&apos;s really beautiful to look at in Scala; the flavor of Hijaz on<br/>the 1/1 at 0-142-409-498 looks especially tempting. By the way, starting<br/>from your 27/16 or Perde Huseyni, we have a quite reasonable version<br/>of Urmavi&apos;s 8/7x9/8x64/63, much more accurate than either Anooshfar&apos;s<br/>or mine In Zest-24 &lt;grin&gt;:</p><p>  |----------------------|-----------------------|........|<br/>  0     214     437     498     703     925     990     1200<br/>    214     223     61      205     222      65     210</p><p>Of course, Urmavi&apos;s septimal steps are tempered, and we have a 3/2<br/>rather than the original 32/21; but such are the inherent compromises<br/>of a temperament, and in fact the vital 28:27 steps are within about<br/>two cents of the just size, rather than 13 cents or more narrow. To<br/>quote Anooshfar&apos;s tuning for comparison from the Scala archive:</p><p>! iran_diat.scl<br/>!<br/>Iranian Diatonic from Dariush Anooshfar, Safi-a-ddin Armavi&apos;s scale from 125 ET<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 220.800 cents<br/> 441.600 cents<br/> 489.600 cents<br/> 710.400 cents<br/> 931.200 cents<br/> 979.200 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>&gt; I urge you not to consider this subset of 125-EDO as a basis for any<br/>&gt; scale construction. The correct Urmavi scale is the one I provided<br/>&gt; above.</p><p>Yes, likely either that Ushshaq or else 8/7x9/8x28/27. As I might put<br/>it, while according to Wright a step like 36/35 does sometimes appear<br/>in sources for maqam tunings around 1250-1300, something like<br/>iran_diat.scl might reflect either some Iranian popular tradition of<br/>intonation or else a xenharmonic variation. It&apos;s too bad that Dariush<br/>Anooshfar isn&apos;t involved in this conversation, because then he could<br/>explain the connection with Urmavi.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Also, the structure of the Zest-24 tuning itself imposes some<br/>&gt;&gt; arbitrary limitations. For example, your 24-note system includes<br/>&gt;&gt; neutral thirds at both 17/14 and 16/13; or, in your 79-MOS, sizes<br/>&gt;&gt; of  both 332 and 362 cents above Rast. In Zest-24, however, I<br/>&gt;&gt; realized  that it is impossible to have two sizes of neutral<br/>&gt;&gt; thirds above the same perde or step. The situation might be<br/>&gt;&gt; analogous to that of some equal temperaments where only a single<br/>&gt;&gt; size of middle or neutral third is available -- although here,<br/>&gt;&gt; the size may change as one moves around the system.</p><p>&gt; 17/14 is not only requisite of Ushshaq as a very low perde segah,<br/>&gt; but also as the second degree of Hijaz as a fairly steep perde<br/>&gt; kurdi.</p><p>Please let me say that if only I could process your dissertation with<br/>my PDF software, then I would read that first and then ask questions!<br/>However, for now, I realize that examples of Ushshaq and Hijaz would<br/>help me in understanding how a 17/14 step is requisite for either.<br/>With Hijaz on Dugah, would this be a correct understanding?</p><p>from Rast:     9/8        17/14     1024/729    3/2<br/>from Dugah:    1/1        68/63     8192/6561   4/3<br/>              Dugah     Dik Kurdi     Hijaz     Neva<br/>                0          132         384      498<br/>                     132         252       112</p><p>This flavor of Hijaz would be a bit like Tala&grave;i&apos;s Persian Chahargah<br/>tetrachord (to use the dastgah name) at around 0-140-380-498 or<br/>140-240-120.</p><p>With Maqam Ushshaq, to ask for an example might be wisest.

Also, you should name 154 cents as Zengule without the<br/>&gt; paranthesis. 274 cents makes a very low kurdi, but kurdi<br/>&gt; nonetheless. Similarly, 345 cents is could be a dik kurdi if you<br/>&gt; prefer. 441 cents is buselik and nishabur at the same time since<br/>&gt; there are no other options.

The difference is that whereas Awj is<br/>typically some kind of middle seventh, Turkish Evdj is evidently at<br/>around 15/8 or 4096/2187 above Rast -- or 48 commas, rather than<br/>somewhere around 46 or 47 commas for Arab perde Awj. This might be a<br/>difference related to Segah at around 17 commas (5/4 or 8192/6561)<br/>above Rast in Maqam Rast as understood in Turkey, but 16 commas or so<br/>in a typical Egyptian interpretation (e.g. something like Zalzal&apos;s<br/>27/22, which you have mentioned as one practice).</p><p>&gt; But you see, you cannot play a decent Hijaz with this setup, because<br/>&gt; you are either consigned to a very low kurdi or a very high dik<br/>&gt; kurdi.</p><p>Certainly we agree that for Maqam Hijaz starting on Dugah,<br/>0-70-383-504 cents or C*-Db*-E*-F* (Dugah-Kurdi-Hijaz-Neva) would place<br/>the second step of the tetrachord &quot;very low,&quot; contrary to the usual<br/>understanding that the lowest step should be smaller than the<br/>highest (here 70-313-121). However, at least if the first step of<br/>Hijaz is understood to be a middle second, I might guess that a &quot;very<br/>high dik kurdi&quot; could be fairly idiomatic:</p><p>       Dugah  Dik Kurdi  Hijaz    Neva    Huseyni  Ajem    Gerdaniye  Muhayyer<br/>         C*       D        E*      F*       G*      Ab*       Bb*       C*<br/>         0       141      383     504      696      778       996      1200<br/>            141      242      121     192       82       218      204</p><p>Here the Hijaz tetrachord is quite close to Tala&grave;i&apos;s 140-240-120, and<br/>the first step is larger than the highest. Flexibly we might state<br/>this conception of Hijaz as something around 6-11-5 commas. Of<br/>course, for the classic kind of Hijaz described by Shirazi at<br/>12/11x7/6x22/21 (a permutation of Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Chromatic), or<br/>151-267-81, we would have to transpose elsewhere, for example, using a<br/>spelling with some enharmonic equivalents (in Zest-24, F#=Gb, etc., in<br/>each 12-note circle):</p><p>Beyati  Dik Huseyni  Rast   Shuri    Kurdi    Segah   Nim Hijaz Tiz Beyati<br/> F#*        G#       A#*     B*       C#*       D         E        F#*<br/>  0        154       422     505      696      766       959      1200<br/>     154        268      83       191      70       192       241</p><p>This classic type of Hijaz is more like 6.5-12-3.5 commas.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=78167 href="#78167">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2008 11:17:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Jim and all,</p><p>Please let me, as you have invited people to do, offer some<br/>suggestions as to the Thummer and the &quot;Matrix&quot; concepts which you and<br/>your colleagues have presented in your paper of that title. What I<br/>would like to focus on especially are some currents of world music and<br/>of recent explorations specifically directed to &quot;alternative tunings&quot;<br/>which might further enrich the Matrix paradigm.</p><p>Rather than attempting at this point to approach the Matrix in terms<br/>of general theory, as interesting as that might be, I&apos;d consider the<br/>most productive strategy at this point from my point of view simply to<br/>survey some tunings and styles which might be relevant to that theory.</p><p>One important theme in this survey is outlooks on melody on harmony<br/>based on sets of partials or primes like 2-3-7, or 2-3-7-11-13. One<br/>very readable presentation of this theme, written in 2002 although<br/>published considerably later, is an article by George Secor, who in<br/>1978 designed a 17-tone well-temperament ideally fitting such an<br/>outlook:</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>As we&apos;ll see in the second part of this presentation, a regular<br/>19-note Thummer tuning at 705 cents nicely serves many of the same<br/>purposes, if not quite so simply or neatly in certain respects.<br/>However, the topic of irregular temperaments such as George&apos;s does<br/>lead to my main techical recommendation: support scale files in the<br/>format used by Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s free scale generation and analysis<br/>program known as Scala &lt;<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/</a>&gt;.</p><p>Of course the Thummer, unlike Scala, is evidently limited to 19 notes<br/>per octave; but 12-note and 17-note irregular temperaments are one<br/>very useful application, and the Scala file format is a community<br/>standard. A special advantage is that people can simply download the<br/>Scala scale archive with over 3000 scales from various world musics<br/>both old and new, or posted here, send them with Scala to a supported<br/>device, and play. This option would greatly enhance the utility of the<br/>Thummer, supplementing rather than replacing its &quot;native&quot; strategies<br/>for defining a tuning and timbre.</p><p>Experience has taught me that I should not simply give a scale with<br/>its chains of generators and sizes of intervals, assuming that the<br/>stylistic possibilities will be self-explanatory. The range of world<br/>musical styles, and of diverse backgrounds contributed by people here<br/>and elsewhere in the &quot;alternative tuning&quot; community, is simply too<br/>great. Especially if an area is familiar to me, but might not be so<br/>familiar to many users or potential users of the Thummer, I&apos;ll try to<br/>give some examples of how intervals and chords can be used in<br/>practice, making this presentation longer but possibly more<br/>informative.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>1. Gamelan at 694.74 cents: 19-tET slendro<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>On an instrument with 19 notes per octave, it&apos;s only natural that<br/>someone would try 19-tET. Let&apos;s see what happens when we apply an<br/>interval mapping most commonly associated with the territory around<br/>Pythagorean tuning with pure fifths, where beta is at about 702 cents,</p><p>The basic idea is that we will define our &quot;minor third&quot; as an<br/>augmented second formed from nine betas or fifths up less five<br/>octaves, or [-5, +9]. Using these special minor thirds, we can form a<br/>scale like this:</p><p>        [0, 0]  [-5, 9]  [1,-1]  [0, 1]   [-5, 10]   [1, 0]<br/>           C       D#       F       G        A#       C<br/>           0      253      505     695      948      1200<br/>              253      253    189.5    253      253</p><p>Note that in 19-tET, this mapping divides the fourth at slightly<br/>larger than 505 cents into two equal intervals -- each an augmented<br/>second, or very small minor third, at 253 cents. Four of these small<br/>minor thirds, plus a usual 19-tET major second or tone [-1, +2] at F-G<br/>with a size of around 189.5 cents, make up an octave of 2:1 or 1200<br/>cents, our period or alpha. The 253-cent third has a size close to a<br/>just 22:19 (254 cents), and the 948-cent seventh to 19:11 (946<br/>cents). The small third could possibly also be taken for a very large<br/>major second or whole tone, and the small seventh also for a very<br/>large major sixth! Intervals of this type around 250 and 950 cents are<br/>very common in gamelan music.</p><p>This beautiful slendro tuning differs in two important ways from a<br/>typical traditional slendro of Java or Bali. First, traditional<br/>tunings are more or less subtly irregular, with the steps differing<br/>from those of 5-tET (with five 240-cent steps) or any other regular<br/>tuning, and the octaves often slightly wider or narrower than 2:1.<br/>Also, the smallest step of a slendro is typically rather wider than<br/>190 cents, although there is immense diversity and steps of around<br/>this size may sometimes occur.</p><p>As with 5-tET, what we have is a charming variation on traditional<br/>slendro -- which, in 19-tET, is available as a kind of alternative to<br/>or change of pace from the usual Renaissance meantone color which was<br/>Guillaume Costeley&apos;s main concern when he described the tuning in<br/>1570. Let&apos;s move to a different region which likewise offers some<br/>fascinating alternative mappings.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Encounter with Archytas and Wilson at 702 cents<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>The term &quot;Pythagorean tuning&quot; refers to a system of just intonation<br/>(JI) based on the pure ratios of the 2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth, 4:3<br/>fourth, and 9:8 tone or major second (1200, 702, 498, and 204 cents).<br/>This style of tuning has been used in a variety of world musics in<br/>places such as China and Japan, very possibly Babylonia, Greece, the<br/>medieval and modern Near East, and medieval Europe.</p><p>Thus tunings at or near 702 cents do very well in styles where fifths<br/>and fourths are the main consonances, sometimes contrasting very<br/>effectively with more complex intervals which invite directed<br/>resolutions to these stable consonances, as in 12th-14th century<br/>European compositions. Additionally, extended Pythagorean tuning can<br/>closely approximate some other simple JI ratios, as we&apos;ll see here.</p><p>One musically engaging possibility is presented by the ancient Greek<br/>theorist Archytas, who describes a tuning which Ptolemy later adopted<br/>as the &quot;Tonic Diatonic.&quot; This tuning features some pure ratios based<br/>on primes 2, 3, and 7: a minor third at 7:6, a major third at 9:7, and<br/>a minor seventh at 7:4 (267, 435, and 969 cents).</p><p>To approximate these ratios of primes 2-3-7 using only chains of pure<br/>or virtually pure fifths (3:2 is 701.955 cents), we&apos;ll need rather<br/>long chains -- which, fortunately, our 19-note tuning is just large<br/>enough to accommodate so that at one unique location, G#, we can find<br/>all seven notes of our desired Archytas tuning. Our arrangement occurs<br/>on the seventh step of the original Archytas/Ptolemy version (closely<br/>approximated in this version if one proceeds A#-A#):</p><p>  [0, 0]   [-1, 2]  [9, -15] [1, -1]  [0, 1]  [-1, 3] [9, -14]  [1, 0]<br/>    G#        A#       Cb       C#      D#       E#      Gb       G#<br/>    0        204      271      498     702      906      973     1200<br/>       204       67       227      204     284       67      227</p><p>Although it is debatable whether or to what degree the harmony of two<br/>or more voices sounding at the same time may have been a factor in<br/>ancient Greek music, today this and related tunings are often used in<br/>styles of harmony rather different from major/minor tonality based on<br/>the 4-5-6 triad. Let&apos;s consider this three-voice progression:</p><p>       D#   E#<br/>       Cb   A#<br/>       G#   A#</p><p>The first chord at 0-271-702 cents closely approximates partials<br/>6-7-9, with a small 7:6 minor third below and a large 9:7 major third<br/>above. The small minor third then contracts to a unison, while the<br/>large major third expands to a fifth, bringing us to the stable fifth<br/>A#-E#. We can expand this to a four-voice progression, and bring in<br/>the additional attraction of a 7:4 minor seventh; like our 7:6 minor<br/>third, this interval will be wide of just by about 3.80 cents, a<br/>rather small amount. The opening chord at 0-271-702-973 cents thus<br/>offers a near-just rendition of partials 12-14-18-21:</p><p>       Gb   E#<br/>       D#   E#<br/>       Cb   A#<br/>       G#   A#</p><p>We get a somewhat different color by rearranging the voices of the<br/>first chord so that a large or 9:7 major third above the lowest voice<br/>expands to a fifth, while a large major sixth around 12:7 expands to<br/>an octave:</p><p>       G#   A#<br/>       Gb   E#<br/>       D#   E#<br/>       Cb   A#</p><p>The lower three voices of this chord can be used in an &quot;Archytan&quot;<br/>variation of a cadence very popular in 13th-century European music,<br/>where a major third contracts to a unison while a minor third expands<br/>to a fifth, which each voice moving by some size of major second or<br/>tone:</p><p>       Gb   E#<br/>       D#   E#<br/>       Cb   A#</p><p>The opening chord with a 9:7 major third _below_ the 7:6 minor third<br/>is in a typical harmonic timbre quite active and strident -- causing<br/>some to call 9:7 the &quot;car horn third,&quot; although more favorably stirred<br/>listeners may call it the &quot;clarion third.&quot; This chord in our 702-cent<br/>tuning is very close to a just 14:18:21. Here the tension is fitting,<br/>because the chord leads into a resolution to a stable fifth, the<br/>favorite consonance in medieval European music.</p><p>However, as the above examples show, the effect is smoother if we<br/>either place the minor 7:6 third below the major 9:7 one -- 6-7-9 --<br/>or else take 14:18:21 and add a 12:7 major sixth, making it<br/>14:18:21:24. as in the example before the last.</p><p>In fact, as George Secor and others have pointed out, a very<br/>harmonious five-note or pentatonic tuning is available using these<br/>ratios which Lou Harrison, among others, has favored as a kind of<br/>slendro.</p><p>          [0, 0]   [9, -15]  [1, -1]   [0, 1]  [9, -14]  [1, 0]<br/>            G#        Cb        C#       D#       Gb       G#<br/>            0         271      498      702       973     1200<br/>                271        227      204       271     227<br/>approx JI:  12        14        16       18        21       24<br/>            1/1       7/6       4/3      3/2       7/4      2/1</p><p>As Secor suggests, all five notes of this scale played at once make a<br/>harmonious chord, approximating partials 12-14-16-18-21. We can, if we<br/>like, focus on fifths and fourths as the main stable concords -- as<br/>often happens in Javanese or Balinese slendro, where, however, these<br/>intervals are typically tuned at some distance from a pure 3:2 or 4:3<br/>in a way that nicely fits the inharmonic timbres! However, Secor calls<br/>attention to some distinctly &quot;modern&quot; possibilities which the Archytan<br/>or 2-3-7 prime approach opens to musicians seeking something new.</p><p>Erv Wilson, a music theorist and instrument designer much interested<br/>in generalized keyboards who recently celebrated his 80th birthday,<br/>has arrived at a beautiful scale related to this last, but with six<br/>notes per octave rather than five -- and therefore called a &quot;hexany.&quot;<br/>Hexanies may be based on various JI ratios or factors: this is the<br/>1-3-7-9 hexany, since it uses these four factors to generate the<br/>tuning.</p><p>Hexanies and other &quot;Combination Product Sets&quot; or CPS systems for short<br/>do this by multiplying subsets of the factors, here 1-3-7-9, to arrive<br/>at products which represent the numbers of partials, and when reduced<br/>to fit within a single octave, define the ratios and intervals of the<br/>tuning. In a CPS system proper, although the number 1 is used in<br/>generating the set, it does not actually itself appear in the tuning<br/>as a &quot;fundamental&quot; note: all of the notes bring into play other<br/>factors. Here the CPS identity for each note as defined by a product<br/>of two of the four factors (1-3-7-9), as well as the Thummer generator<br/>chain, is shown for each note:</p><p>  [0, 0]   [-1, 2]  [9, -15] [8, -13] [0, 1]  [9, -14]  [1, 0]<br/>    G#        A#       Cb       Db      D#       Gb       G#<br/>   1.3       3.9      1.7      7.9     1.9      3.7      1.3<br/>    0        204      271      475     702      973      1200<br/>       204        67      204      227     271       227</p><p>The hexany features some sonorities or chords we have already<br/>encountered like 6:7:9 (G#-Cb-D#) or 12:14:18:21 (G#-Cb-D#-Gb). We<br/>additionally encounter a wonderful chord featuring an interval with a<br/>very special and striking effect: the narrow fourth at 21:16, here<br/>tempered like other ratios of 7 at about 3.8 cents wide, or 475 cents:</p><p>                     Gb<br/>                     D#<br/>                     Cb<br/>                     G#</p><p>This sound closely approximates partials 16-21-24-28: the 3:2 fifth<br/>and outer 7:4 minor seventh &quot;anchor&quot; the chord, while the 21:16 above<br/>the lowest voice adds a certain feeling of &quot;tension&quot; or energy.</p><p>While hexanies and similar tunings are often intended to encourage an<br/>exploration of &quot;consonance for its own sake,&quot; so to speak, rather than<br/>conventionally directed harmony of one sort or another, the hexany<br/>does support a characteristic 13th-century Euyropean cadence where a<br/>minor third expands to a fifth and a minor sixth to an octave. Here<br/>these intervals have proportions very close to a just 7:6 and 14:9<br/>(267 and 765 cents in JI, and here 271 and 769 cents):</p><p>             Gb    G#<br/>             Db    D#<br/>             A#    G#</p><p>We can also add a seventh note to our hexany, making it a related<br/>heptatonic or &quot;seven-note&quot; scale:</p><p>  [0, 0]   [-1, 2]  [9, -15] [8, -13] [0, 1]  [-1, 3] [9, -14]  [1, 0]<br/>    G#        A#       Cb       Db      D#       E#      Gb       G#<br/>    0        204      271      475     702      906      973     1200<br/>       204       67       227      204     284       67      227</p><p>This scale adds a usual Pythagorean major sixth E# above our resting<br/>note or &quot;final&quot; of G# -- a note also present in our earlier Archytan<br/>tuning. The difference is that here, as in the hexany, we have a<br/>narrow 21:16 fourth at Db rather than a usual 4:3 Pythagorean fourth<br/>at C#.</p><p>With this tuning, we have a characteristic resolution available for<br/>the 16:21:24:28 chord featured in the hexany:</p><p>                     Gb     E#<br/>                     D#     E#<br/>                     Cb     A#<br/>                     G#     A#</p><p>As in some of the earlier progressions above, the outer 7:4 minor<br/>seventh contracts to a fifth. This cadence very nicely releases the<br/>&quot;tension&quot; of the 16:21:24:28 chord; but from another viewpoint,<br/>encouraged by the hexany, we can take it simply as an energetic kind<br/>of consonance that doesn&apos;t necessarily need to &quot;go&quot; anywhere. Our<br/>Thummer system pleasantly allows both viewpoints.</p><p>Let&apos;s return for a moment to our original Archytan scale to make a<br/>final point about Pythagorean tuning and its musical possibilities.</p><p>  [0, 0]   [-1, 2]  [9, -15] [1, -1]  [0, 1]  [-1, 3] [9, -14]  [1, 0]<br/>    G#        A#       Cb       C#      D#       E#      Gb       G#<br/>    0        204      271      498     702      906      973     1200<br/>       204       67       227      204     284       67      227</p><p>We&apos;ve gone to considerable lengths in seeking out those 7-based<br/>intervals: in fact, in order to get this simple scale, we&apos;ve had to<br/>draw on the full length or span of our 19-note gamut, from Cb to E#!<br/>However, many of the progressions we&apos;ve explored with Archytan or<br/>2-3-7 prime intervals and chords are also effective with the usual<br/>Pythagorean intervals such as thirds and sixths -- as they should be,<br/>since some of them are taken directly from 13th-14th century European<br/>compositions written in a period when Pythagorean was the usual tuning<br/>system.</p><p>Consider, for example, this progression:</p><p>          E#    Gb<br/>          C#    Cb<br/>          A#    Cb</p><p>Our opening chord is a regular Pythagorean version of a lower minor<br/>third at 294 cents or 32:27, and an upper major third C#-E# at 408<br/>cents or 81:64. As in earlier examples, the minor third contracts to a<br/>unison while the major third expands to a fifth. For many listeners,<br/>this type of chord, known in medieval times as a &quot;split fifth&quot; where<br/>an outer fifth is divided or &quot;split&quot; into two thirds, may sound more<br/>harmonious with the minor third placed below -- as we found also with<br/>6:7:9 and 14:18:21. However, the form with the quite active 81:64<br/>major third placed below is also very common and effective in<br/>13th-century writing:</p><p>          G#     A#<br/>          E#     D#<br/>          C#     D#</p><p>This outlook and the major third as a _relatively_ &quot;concordant&quot; but<br/>rather tense interval pulling dynamically toward some kind of<br/>resolving cadence is quite different from the view of major/minor<br/>tonality, where it is the essence of rest and stability in a system<br/>based on partials 4-5-6 -- and the different tunings fit naturally<br/>with these different worldviews.</p><p>Also, while we&apos;ve rightly focused a lot of attention on the 7:4 minor<br/>seventh, the Pythagorean tuning has another very important type of<br/>minor seventh at the ratio of 16:9, equal to two Pythagorean 4:3<br/>fourths, or two fifths down plus two octaves [2, -2]. Around 1200,<br/>this seventh is featured by Perotin and other composer in a most<br/>impressive closing cadence where the lowest voice remains stationary:</p><p>           G#    A#<br/>           D#    E#<br/>           A#</p><p>The cadence has a 4:3 fourth and 16:9 minor seventh (498 and 996<br/>cents) above the lowest voice, with the upper voices progressing<br/>smoothly in parallel fourths to the fifth and octave, arriving at the<br/>ideal medieval harmony defined by partials 2-3-4. In period theory<br/>the minor seventh is often called an &quot;imperfect&quot; interval -- often an<br/>&quot;imperfect discord,&quot; but sometimes an &quot;imperfect concord&quot; -- meaning<br/>that it is rather tense in itself, but not acutely so, and has a<br/>certain degree of blend also. Combining it with two pure fourths, as<br/>in A#-D#-G#, brings out this &quot;somewhat blending&quot; aspect.</p><p>In 20th-century terms, this would be called a &quot;fourth chord,&quot; often<br/>used by composers such as Debussy and Bartok, and also favored in some<br/>styles of jazz harmonization. In fact, sonorities built in fourths or<br/>fifths are common not only in medieval and modern European practice,<br/>but in various other world musics, with Japanese gagaku or traditional<br/>orchestral court music taking this process to an impressive degree of<br/>complexity.</p><p>Happily, a 19-note Pythagorean tuning abounds in pure fifths and<br/>fourths, and also in other regular intervals such as thirds and sixths<br/>that can be used in the familiar patterns of 13th-14th century<br/>European and other world musical styles -- as well as some &quot;special&quot;<br/>intervals such as the Archytan.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s additionally possible to use a schismatic mapping in<br/>order to obtain pure or near-pure ratios of 5 (e.g. thirds at 5:4 and<br/>6:5). However, a regular Pythagorean mapping offers the option of<br/>exploring a very rich territory that has nourished many centuries of<br/>world musical experience; and the Archytan intervals are there for<br/>those with the patience to seek them out. As we&apos;ll see, there are<br/>other places on the continuum where these 2-3-7 intervals abound; but<br/>the allure of combining them with pure fifths and fourths makes the<br/>search at 702 cents worth the effort.</p><p>(To be continued)</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=78182 href="#78182">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2008 7:01:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;         [0, 0]  [-5, 9]  [1,-1]  [0, 1]   [-5, 10]   [1, 0]<br/>&gt;            C       D#       F       G        A#       C<br/>&gt;            0      253      505     695      948      1200<br/>&gt;               253      253    189.5    253      253<br/>&gt; &gt; Note that in 19-tET, this mapping divides the fourth at slightly<br/>&gt; larger than 505 cents into two equal intervals -- each an augmented<br/>&gt; second, or very small minor third, at 253 cents. Four of these small<br/>&gt; minor thirds, plus a usual 19-tET major second or tone [-1, +2] at F-G<br/>&gt; with a size of around 189.5 cents, make up an octave of 2:1 or 1200<br/>&gt; cents, our period or alpha. The 253-cent third has a size close to a<br/>&gt; just 22:19 (254 cents), and the 948-cent seventh to 19:11 (946<br/>&gt; cents). The small third could possibly also be taken for a very large<br/>&gt; major second or whole tone, and the small seventh also for a very<br/>&gt; large major sixth! Intervals of this type around 250 and 950 cents are<br/>&gt; very common in gamelan music.</p><p>There&apos;s a bit in Easley Blackwood&apos;s 19-ET etude that illustrates this equal division of the fourth nicely.

Our arrangement occurs<br/>&gt; on the seventh step of the original Archytas/Ptolemy version (closely<br/>&gt; approximated in this version if one proceeds A#-A#):<br/>&gt; &gt;   [0, 0]   [-1, 2]  [9, -15] [1, -1]  [0, 1]  [-1, 3] [9, -14]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;     G#        A#       Cb       C#      D#       E#      Gb       G#<br/>&gt;     0        204      271      498     702      906      973     1200<br/>&gt;        204       67       227      204     284       67      227</p><p>Unfortunately, these leaps are pretty awkward on the Wicki layout. You&apos;ll want a Bosanquet for this. Fortunately, there&apos;s a Wicki-friendly temperament that&apos;s a pretty close match to this. Note that if you divide 204 cents into three equal parts you get three 68-cent steps, which is almost the same as 67. Setting the fifths to 634 cents results in 68-cent steps horizontally. This tuning also has nice neutral seconds.</p><p>+-------------------------------+<br/>|       G#                      |<br/>|                               |<br/>| C#  --  --  D#  --  --  E# Gb |<br/>|                               |<br/>|       G#  --  -- A#  Cb       |<br/>+-------------------------------+</p></div><h3><a id=78184 href="#78184">ðŸ”—</a>Billy Gard &#x3C;billygard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2008 10:53:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; The opening chord with a 9:7 major third _below_ the 7:6 minor third is<br/>in a typical harmonic timbre quite active and strident -- causing some to<br/>call 9:7 the &quot;car horn third,&quot; although more favorably stirred listeners may<br/>call it the &quot;clarion third.&quot; This chord in our 702-cent tuning is very close<br/>to a just 14:18:21. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>I like to call these the super-major and sub-minor, or septimal major and<br/>minor.

Only after reading Arslan&apos;s article (which he wanted me to check beforehand) and the said book have I seen how Urmevi employs very high limit intervals in his divisions of tetrachords and pentachords. You might want to examine Arslan&apos;s article, even though it is in Turkish:</p><p><a href="http://www.fazliarslan.com/safiyyuddin_serefiyyesinde_musiki_matematigi.pdf">http://www.fazliarslan.com/safiyyuddin_serefiyyesinde_musiki_matematigi.pdf</a></p><p>The tetrachord 8:7 x 9:8 x 28:27 is called first muttasil (contiguous). Using this tetrachord in an adjunct manner, Urmevi constructs and octave species he calls the fourth Munfasil al-ahad. It is clear that Urmevi is thinking in terms of JI here, and that 125 logarithmic divisions of the octave cannot yield a subset to satisfactorily represent all intervals, while Yarman24, as you discovered, can (best on the 7th, 16th, 17th, 20th, 21st degrees).</p><p>Though, I admit with enthusiasm that Zest-24 does a very good job with many maqam flavours!</p><p>Also, bear in mind that Urmevi was demonstrating mental exercises to attain tetrachord and pentachord divisions compatible with practice. It is clear that he implies that not all of the divisions he formulated are to be used. He even categorizes them vaguely from most consonant to the least.</p><p>I agree that small neutral thirds are a specialty of Persian music under the sphere of Eastern maqam musics, but I do not agree that 170 cents is a particular feature of the genre.</p><p>Dear Margo, I am experiencing mental fatigue and beseech you to postpone your request for more maqam flavours in Hijaz, Nikriz and Neveser. Let me briefly state that Turkish musicians tend to raise the second degree of Hijaz and lower the third. Supraminor seconds can be seen in Ushshaq and its variants (possibly Karjighar) as well. Everywhere there is a variant of Hijaz or Ushshaq, you are likely to find supraminor seconds.</p><p>I found this site, with a link to Neveser too:</p><p><a href="http://www.makamlar.net/makamlar.html">http://www.makamlar.net/makamlar.html</a></p><p>The pentachord you have given resembles a transposed intro to Nikriz or Neveser.</p><p>Yes, the Hijaz and Ushshaq tetrachords you have given are spot on! However, I do not use 1024/729 specifically, but a 380 cent interval. Don&apos;t forget 16/13 as an Ushshaq flavour when ascending melodically.</p><p>Turkish evdj indeed echoes Turkish segah, as it is the fifth complement of the latter.</p><p>Ah, 141 cents for dik kurdi is way too steep I&apos;m afraid. But for the lack of any better interval, 141 cents might be substituted in place of 68/63. Shirazi&apos;s version would require perde hijaz to rise along with perde segah. But when hijaz is as low as 5/4 from dugah, dik kurdi has to be lower than 140 cents.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>On Aug 12, 2008, at 4:11 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Dear Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My apologies for the very late reply.

Bear in mind that this Ushshaq has nothing to<br/>&gt;&gt; do with the Ushshaq we perform today. I am at a lost to explain how<br/>&gt;&gt; a diatonic major scale got transformed to a neutral minor during the<br/>&gt;&gt; centuries that followed Urmavi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This looks like a very interesting conversation! This summer I found<br/>&gt; on the Web a paper by Dr. Fazli Arslan of the Turkish Ministry of<br/>&gt; Education and others, _Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and the Theory of Music_<br/>&gt; (March 2007), which leads to the conclusion that Anooshfar might have<br/>&gt; had a different tuning of Urmavi in mind -- but first this Ushshaq.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly we agree that if Anooshfar had intended this tuning, then<br/>&gt; his 125-EDO version would seem very curious! I wonder if, instead, he<br/>&gt; had this septimal flavor of Urmavi, again with two conjunct<br/>&gt; tetrachords plus an upper 9:8 tone, in mind, based on what Urmavi<br/>&gt; called &quot;the first conjunct&quot; tetrachord of 8/7x9/8x28/27, to which I<br/>&gt; will add an indication of approximate Pythagorean-53 or 53-EDO commas:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           10    9     3      10      9      3       9<br/>&gt; commas:  0    10    19    22       32     41     44      53<br/>&gt;        1/1   8/7   9/7   4/3    32/21   12/7   16/9    2/1<br/>&gt; cents:   0    231   435   498     729     933    996   1200<br/>&gt;           8:7   9:8  28:27   8:7     9:8   28:27   9:8<br/>&gt;           231   204   63     231     204     63    204<br/>&gt;         |-----------------|----------------------|.....|<br/>&gt;             lower jins          upper jins         9:8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This 0-231-435-498 or 231-204-63 tuning seems to me considerably<br/>&gt; closer to Anooshfar&apos;s tetrachord of about 0-221-442-490 or 221-221-48<br/>&gt; than Urmavi&apos;s Ushshaq at 0-204-408-498 (or 9-9-4 commas). If we start<br/>&gt; from this septimal flavor of Urmavi, then three basic changes might<br/>&gt; lead to an interpretation like Anooshfar&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first change is to use some fifths tempered about 1/3-comma wide,<br/>&gt; or fourths 1/3-comma narrow, so that we have Urmavi&apos;s 4/3 placed at<br/>&gt; around 491 cents and his 16/9 at around 982 cents -- as in 22-EDO.<br/>&gt; The second is a very dramatic narrowing of the original 28:27 step (as<br/>&gt; in the diatonic of Archytas, of which Urmavi&apos;s tuning is a<br/>&gt; permutation) from 63 cents to 50 cents, a quirk to which both<br/>&gt; Anooshfar and I seem curiously attracted &lt;grin&gt;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        Bb*   Db    Eb    Eb*     Gb      Ab     Ab*     Bb*<br/>&gt; cents:   0    224   441   491     728     932    982    1200<br/>&gt;           224   217   50     237     204     50    218<br/>&gt;         |-----------------|----------------------|.....|<br/>&gt;             lower jins          upper jins         9:8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To get an approximation of Anooshfar&apos;s 0-221-442-490-710-931-979-1200,<br/>&gt; we need additionally to substitute a wide tempered 3/2 for Urmavi&apos;s<br/>&gt; 32/21, interestingly almost just in the last Zest-24 example at 728<br/>&gt; cents:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        Bb*   Db    Eb    Eb*      F*     Ab     Ab*     Bb*<br/>&gt; cents:   0    224   441   491     708     932    982    1200<br/>&gt;           224   217   50     217     224     50    218<br/>&gt;         |-----------------|----------------------|.....|<br/>&gt;             lower jins          upper jins         9:8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Humorously, I might suggest that my attraction to this Anooshfar<br/>&gt; tuning comes from the routine license in Zest-24 of often tempering<br/>&gt; 28:27 at 50 cents, actually a virtually just 35:34! A milder version<br/>&gt; of this license would occur in 22-EDO:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         C    D    E   F    G     A  Bb     C<br/>&gt; cents:   0   218  436 491  709   927 982  1200<br/>&gt;          218  218  55   218  218  55  218<br/>&gt;         |-------------|--------------|.....|<br/>&gt;           lower jins     upper jins    tone<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The liberty involved here could be put another way: Urmavi&apos;s 16/9 is<br/>&gt; being tempered with narrow fourths down to something like 982 cents,<br/>&gt; which represents both 16/9 and 7/4. Thus his interval 12/7-16/9<br/>&gt; becomes something like 12/7-30/17, or about 35:34 -- almost exactly<br/>&gt; what it is in Zest-24! If the idea is to get a somewhat less<br/>&gt; inaccurate version of Urmavi&apos;s steps, then in Zest-24 we might try:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         |---------------|---------------|......|<br/>&gt;         C     D*   E*   F     G    A*   Bb     C<br/>&gt;         0    242  434  504   696  937  996   1200<br/>&gt;           242  192   70   192   241  59   204<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here either 70 cents or 59 cents is a more or less reasonable<br/>&gt; approximation of 28:27 -- although not as close as with your 17<br/>&gt; perdeler! We have a virtually just 16/9 without any pretensions of<br/>&gt; representing 7/4. The 241/242-cent steps are rather wider than 8:7;<br/>&gt; but one might argue that getting 28:27 more accurately is most<br/>&gt; important if the idea is faithfully to represent Urmavi&apos;s tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I should state further, that it is most unfortunate that Turks have<br/>&gt;&gt; not written a single academic work on their conception of Maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; music for the auspices of the international music community since<br/>&gt;&gt; Rauf Yekta. My thesis should serve as a brick that closes the<br/>&gt;&gt; centennial gap.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and clearly I am encountering a software limitation in<br/>&gt; Ghostscript that causes a VMerror (not enough virtual memory) in<br/>&gt; processing the file. Obviously it is vital that I find some solution<br/>&gt; -- possibly a later version of this software that might handle more<br/>&gt; recent PDF files (I tried this some months ago and it solved a problem<br/>&gt; with a set of PDF files for John Chalmers&apos; book on tetrachords.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is _my_ problem, not yours, and it&apos;s obvious that I need to<br/>&gt; figure out some way of reading and reviewing your dissertation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [On avoiding the region around 170 cents, or &quot;equitable heptatonic&quot;<br/>&gt; close to 7-EDO, in maqam music]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Indeed so. I remember having stated the necessity to avoid the<br/>&gt;&gt; equitable heptotonic in Yarman24.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, over the summer I found your 24-note system where you mentioned<br/>&gt; this. Personally, I tend to regard a 170-cent step as a &quot;Persian<br/>&gt; liberty,&quot; more fitting to a dastgah style than a usual maqam style.<br/>&gt; Since it often occurs in a Zest-24 tetrachord like 0-191-333-504 cents<br/>&gt; (e.g. C*-D*-E-F*) with steps of 191-141-171 cents, where the small<br/>&gt; neutral third around 40:33 would fit a Persian style, this view might<br/>&gt; have some connection to Near Eastern practice. An interesting question<br/>&gt; is whether a tetrachord like F*-G*-A-Bb* or 0-192-333-492 cents, with<br/>&gt; steps of 192-141-159 cents, might fit into an Arab or Turkish maqam<br/>&gt; style. You&apos;ve mentioned that these small neutral thirds do occur.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One place 26/21 comes up is in Ibn Sina&apos;s 28:26:24:21 tetrachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I checked Ibn Sina&apos;s passages. The actual tetrachord is given as 8:7<br/>&gt;&gt; x 14:13 x 13:12. The tetrachord you have mentioned permutes the last<br/>&gt;&gt; two intervals. In the original form, we have 16:13 instead of<br/>&gt;&gt; 26:21. But I suspect the tetrachord should be read the other way<br/>&gt;&gt; around, which yields 12:13:14:16. Ibn Sina calls this a Kavi genus<br/>&gt;&gt; which is of quality and nobility, I am not sure what this<br/>&gt;&gt; corresponds to in music theory of the Ancient world. Ibn Sina says<br/>&gt;&gt; that this is the genus preferred by Ptolemy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This tetrachord comes up in Urmavi also, and the string ratios given<br/>&gt; confirm the same order you give for Ibn Sina&apos;s version; Urmavi&apos;s<br/>&gt; tuning uses conjunct tetrachords, with a 32/21 above the final, as in<br/>&gt; the 8/7x9/8x28/27 tuning discussed above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; lengths:    64    56   52    48    42    39    36    32<br/>&gt;            |----------------|------------------|.....|<br/>&gt;           1/1   8/7  16/13 4/3   32/21 64/39 16/9   2/1<br/>&gt;            0    231   359  498    729   857   996  1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed if read the tetrachord &quot;the other way,&quot; with the string lengths<br/>&gt; taken instead as frequencies (to put it in one modern way), we get<br/>&gt; 12:13:14:16, a tetrachord much favored by George Secor. John Chalmers<br/>&gt; has the 28:26:24:21 or 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3 I mentioned above in his<br/>&gt; avicenna_diat.scl in the Scala archive; maybe this assumes the common<br/>&gt; although not invariable Greek custom of putting the smallest interval<br/>&gt; first.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but supraminor thirds are not restricted to Persian music. For<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; you see, they are important flavours in such maqams as Hijaz, Nikriz<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and Neveser. I admit, though, that Persians are more fond of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; supraminor seconds compared to middler seconds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Might I ask for a few examples of these maqam flavors? I know some<br/>&gt; general forms of Hijaz and Nakriz as practiced in some Arab regions,<br/>&gt; but have learned that the names and tunings can vary in different<br/>&gt; regions. (Suz-i Dilara is a very curious example which I maybe should<br/>&gt; save for another post.) Below we discuss this further, and I guess at<br/>&gt; possible examples in Hijaz and Ushshaq on Dugah. Nakriz I think of as<br/>&gt; a pentachord with a lower tone plus a Hijaz tetrachord, and if I place<br/>&gt; this on Neva in Zest-24, then the example might serve our purposes,<br/>&gt; with the middle step of the pentachord at 333 cents or 40/33:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Neva   Huseyni  Dik Ajem Sehnaz  Muhayyer<br/>&gt;       F*       G*       A       B*       C*<br/>&gt;       0       192      333     575      696<br/>&gt;           192      141     242      121<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am not sure what Neveser is, and this example would be especially<br/>&gt; interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 14:17:21 makes a wonderful neutral chord.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Agreed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This is a fascinating design: 12 notes from a circulating temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; of Rameau, and the other 12 added to provide some delicious Maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; flavors!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;[34]<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76333">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76333</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Don&apos;t forget the 17-tone closed cycle achieved via superpythagorean<br/>&gt;&gt; fifths for 7-limit major and minor chords!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes! It&apos;s really beautiful to look at in Scala; the flavor of Hijaz on<br/>&gt; the 1/1 at 0-142-409-498 looks especially tempting. By the way, &gt; starting<br/>&gt; from your 27/16 or Perde Huseyni, we have a quite reasonable version<br/>&gt; of Urmavi&apos;s 8/7x9/8x64/63, much more accurate than either Anooshfar&apos;s<br/>&gt; or mine In Zest-24 &lt;grin&gt;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  |----------------------|-----------------------|........|<br/>&gt;  0     214     437     498     703     925     990     1200<br/>&gt;    214     223     61      205     222      65     210<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, Urmavi&apos;s septimal steps are tempered, and we have a 3/2<br/>&gt; rather than the original 32/21; but such are the inherent compromises<br/>&gt; of a temperament, and in fact the vital 28:27 steps are within about<br/>&gt; two cents of the just size, rather than 13 cents or more narrow. To<br/>&gt; quote Anooshfar&apos;s tuning for comparison from the Scala archive:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! iran_diat.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Iranian Diatonic from Dariush Anooshfar, Safi-a-ddin Armavi&apos;s scale &gt; from 125 ET<br/>&gt; 7<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 220.800 cents<br/>&gt; 441.600 cents<br/>&gt; 489.600 cents<br/>&gt; 710.400 cents<br/>&gt; 931.200 cents<br/>&gt; 979.200 cents<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I urge you not to consider this subset of 125-EDO as a basis for any<br/>&gt;&gt; scale construction. The correct Urmavi scale is the one I provided<br/>&gt;&gt; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, likely either that Ushshaq or else 8/7x9/8x28/27. As I might put<br/>&gt; it, while according to Wright a step like 36/35 does sometimes appear<br/>&gt; in sources for maqam tunings around 1250-1300, something like<br/>&gt; iran_diat.scl might reflect either some Iranian popular tradition of<br/>&gt; intonation or else a xenharmonic variation. It&apos;s too bad that Dariush<br/>&gt; Anooshfar isn&apos;t involved in this conversation, because then he could<br/>&gt; explain the connection with Urmavi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, the structure of the Zest-24 tuning itself imposes some<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; arbitrary limitations. For example, your 24-note system includes<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; neutral thirds at both 17/14 and 16/13; or, in your 79-MOS, sizes<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; of  both 332 and 362 cents above Rast. In Zest-24, however, I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; realized  that it is impossible to have two sizes of neutral<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; thirds above the same perde or step. The situation might be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; analogous to that of some equal temperaments where only a single<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; size of middle or neutral third is available -- although here,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the size may change as one moves around the system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 17/14 is not only requisite of Ushshaq as a very low perde segah,<br/>&gt;&gt; but also as the second degree of Hijaz as a fairly steep perde<br/>&gt;&gt; kurdi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me say that if only I could process your dissertation with<br/>&gt; my PDF software, then I would read that first and then ask questions!<br/>&gt; However, for now, I realize that examples of Ushshaq and Hijaz would<br/>&gt; help me in understanding how a 17/14 step is requisite for either.<br/>&gt; With Hijaz on Dugah, would this be a correct understanding?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; from Rast:     9/8        17/14     1024/729    3/2<br/>&gt; from Dugah:    1/1        68/63     8192/6561   4/3<br/>&gt;              Dugah     Dik Kurdi     Hijaz     Neva<br/>&gt;                0          132         384      498<br/>&gt;                     132         252       112<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This flavor of Hijaz would be a bit like Tala&grave;i&apos;s Persian Chahargah<br/>&gt; tetrachord (to use the dastgah name) at around 0-140-380-498 or<br/>&gt; 140-240-120.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With Maqam Ushshaq, to ask for an example might be wisest. If this<br/>&gt; also starts on Dugah as final, then we would have something like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; from Rast:     9/8        17/14        4/3      3/2<br/>&gt; from Dugah:    1/1        68/63       13/11     4/3<br/>&gt;              Dugah     Nerm Segah  Chahargah   Neva<br/>&gt;                0          132         289      498<br/>&gt;                     132         157        209<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this close to a correct example of 17/14 in Ushshaq?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [My possible names of steps for a Maqam tuning in Zest-24]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;                  approx    tentative               approx   approx<br/>&gt;&gt; degree    cents    159-EDO   perde name              288-EDO    RI<br/>&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt; 0:     0.00000      0      Rast                       0      1/1<br/>&gt;&gt; 1:    32.81250      4      (Sarp Rast)                8     64/63<br/>&gt;&gt; 2:    83.20312     11      Shuri                     20     22/21<br/>&gt;&gt; 3:   153.51562     20      (Zengule cluster)         37     12/11<br/>&gt;&gt; 4:   203.90624     27      Dugah                     48      9/8<br/>&gt;&gt; 5:   223.82812     30      (Sarp Dugah)              54      8/7<br/>&gt;&gt; 6:   274.21874     37      Nerm (soft) Kurdi         66     75/64<br/>&gt;&gt; 7:   344.53124     46      Segah of Ushshaq          83     11/9<br/>&gt;&gt; 8:   394.92187     52      Segah                     95      5/4<br/>&gt;&gt; 9:   440.62500     58      Dik Nishabur             106      9/7<br/>&gt;&gt; 10:   491.01562     65      Chargah                  118      4/3<br/>&gt;&gt; 11:   536.71875     71      Nim Hijaz                129     15/11<br/>&gt;&gt; 12:   587.10937     78      Hijaz                    141      7/5<br/>&gt;&gt; 13:   657.42187     87      (Saba cluster)           158     19/13<br/>&gt;&gt; 14:   707.81249     94      Neva                     170      3/2<br/>&gt;&gt; 15:   727.73437     96      (Sarp Neva)              175     32/21<br/>&gt;&gt; 16:   778.12500    103      Bayyati                  187     11/7<br/>&gt;&gt; 17:   849.60937    113      (Hisar/Huzzam cluster)   204     18/11<br/>&gt;&gt; 18:   899.99999    119      Huseyni                  216     27/16<br/>&gt;&gt; 19:   931.64062    123      (Sarp Huseyni)           224     12/7<br/>&gt;&gt; 20:   982.03124    130      Koutchouk (little) Ajem  236     30/17<br/>&gt;&gt; 21:  1040.62500    138      (Evdj cluster)           250     51/28<br/>&gt;&gt; 22:  1091.01562    145      Evdj                     262     15/8<br/>&gt;&gt; 23:  1149.60937    152      Mahurek                  276     64/33<br/>&gt;&gt; 24:  1200.00000    159      Gerdaniye                288      2/1<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Your reply]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Since there are no more steps between rast and shuri, you should<br/>&gt;&gt; name the second degree as dik rast. The same goes for sarp dugah,<br/>&gt;&gt; sarp neva, and sarp huseyni. They should all be dik in<br/>&gt;&gt; parantheses. Also, you should name 154 cents as Zengule without the<br/>&gt;&gt; paranthesis. 274 cents makes a very low kurdi, but kurdi<br/>&gt;&gt; nonetheless. Similarly, 345 cents is could be a dik kurdi if you<br/>&gt;&gt; prefer. 441 cents is buselik and nishabur at the same time since<br/>&gt;&gt; there are no other options. I&apos;d rather you called it a buselik. Saba<br/>&gt;&gt; cluster should be plainly saba. You could drop one y from Bayyati to<br/>&gt;&gt; make it more Turkish. 845 cents is plainly hisar without the<br/>&gt;&gt; paranthesis. Little ajem is needless since we took kurdi<br/>&gt;&gt; plainly. Let&apos;s call it simply ajem. Evdj cluster is a misnomer here,<br/>&gt;&gt; it should be a dik ajem. Mahurek ought to be mahur.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This does make a lot of sense to me: if we are looking at this<br/>&gt; temperament as a system in itself, then if there is only one possible<br/>&gt; tuning for a given perde, why not just say &quot;ajem&quot; or &quot;mahur,&quot; etc.?<br/>&gt; Your point about the spelling of Bayati may be especially fitting<br/>&gt; because I&apos;ve noticed that at least according to Marcus, the modern<br/>&gt; Arab system doesn&apos;t have a perde Bayati (or Bayyati)!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for &quot;Evdj cluster&quot; at 1041 cents, I realize that my concept of a<br/>&gt; &quot;neutral seventh&quot; might better fit the Arab perde Awj, although your<br/>&gt; &quot;Evdj kumesi&quot; at around 11:6 or 1049 cents might fit a typical Arab<br/>&gt; tuning better than 1041 cents. The difference is that whereas Awj is<br/>&gt; typically some kind of middle seventh, Turkish Evdj is evidently at<br/>&gt; around 15/8 or 4096/2187 above Rast -- or 48 commas, rather than<br/>&gt; somewhere around 46 or 47 commas for Arab perde Awj. This might be a<br/>&gt; difference related to Segah at around 17 commas (5/4 or 8192/6561)<br/>&gt; above Rast in Maqam Rast as understood in Turkey, but 16 commas or so<br/>&gt; in a typical Egyptian interpretation (e.g. something like Zalzal&apos;s<br/>&gt; 27/22, which you have mentioned as one practice).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But you see, you cannot play a decent Hijaz with this setup, because<br/>&gt;&gt; you are either consigned to a very low kurdi or a very high dik<br/>&gt;&gt; kurdi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly we agree that for Maqam Hijaz starting on Dugah,<br/>&gt; 0-70-383-504 cents or C*-Db*-E*-F* (Dugah-Kurdi-Hijaz-Neva) would &gt; place<br/>&gt; the second step of the tetrachord &quot;very low,&quot; contrary to the usual<br/>&gt; understanding that the lowest step should be smaller than the<br/>&gt; highest (here 70-313-121). However, at least if the first step of<br/>&gt; Hijaz is understood to be a middle second, I might guess that a &quot;very<br/>&gt; high dik kurdi&quot; could be fairly idiomatic:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Dugah  Dik Kurdi  Hijaz    Neva    Huseyni  Ajem    Gerdaniye  &gt; Muhayyer<br/>&gt;         C*       D        E*      F*       G*      Ab*       &gt; Bb*       C*<br/>&gt;         0       141      383     504      696      778       &gt; 996      1200<br/>&gt;            141      242      121     192       82       218      204<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the Hijaz tetrachord is quite close to Tala&grave;i&apos;s 140-240-120, and<br/>&gt; the first step is larger than the highest. Flexibly we might state<br/>&gt; this conception of Hijaz as something around 6-11-5 commas. Of<br/>&gt; course, for the classic kind of Hijaz described by Shirazi at<br/>&gt; 12/11x7/6x22/21 (a permutation of Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Chromatic), or<br/>&gt; 151-267-81, we would have to transpose elsewhere, for example, using a<br/>&gt; spelling with some enharmonic equivalents (in Zest-24, F#=Gb, etc., in<br/>&gt; each 12-note circle):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beyati  Dik Huseyni  Rast   Shuri    Kurdi    Segah   Nim Hijaz Tiz &gt; Beyati<br/>&gt; F#*        G#       A#*     B*       C#*       D         E        F#*<br/>&gt;  0        154       422     505      696      766       959      1200<br/>&gt;     154        268      83       191      70       192       241<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This classic type of Hijaz is more like 6.5-12-3.5 commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

The early 14th century is an<br/>incredibly creative and productive era in European musical practice<br/>and theory, as likewise in the Islamic world in this and the<br/>immediately previous epochs, as with Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and Qutb<br/>al-Din al-Shirazi.</p><p>While the quantitative details of the fivefold division of the tone<br/>proposed by Marchettus are fascinating, I would start with his<br/>practical musical intent: to describe and guide the intonation of<br/>singers performing polyphonic music. He is not addressing, for<br/>example, the tuning of keyboard instruments, but the rather the art of<br/>that most flexible instrument: the human voice.</p><p>What he seems to be describing is a system of Pythagorean intonation,<br/>or something very like it, which however may be and indeed should be<br/>modified in directed polyphonic progressions by contrary motion which<br/>involve certain accidental alterations.

I tend to agree with Page that for singers,<br/>&gt; artistic intuition coupled with a general understanding of the nature<br/>&gt; of accentuated Pythagorean intonation and of period style may be the<br/>&gt; best guide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For fixed-pitch instruments, Marchettus has inspired a variety of<br/>&gt; neomedieval tunings -- rather as ancient Greek writings on music<br/>&gt; inspired the opera and oratorio around 1600. It bears emphasis that<br/>&gt; Marchettus does not, to my best knowledge, discuss temperament, or<br/>&gt; keyboard instruments -- but his intriguing theory and evocative<br/>&gt; description of the musical values behind it are a wonderful entre to a<br/>&gt; new century of possibilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

The world at 705 cents: neutral intervals<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>In our 19-tET gamelan tuning, we used an augmented second [-5, 9] and<br/>augmented sixth [-5, 10] to produce the small 253-cent minor third and<br/>948-cent minor seventh in this shading of slendro. As the tuning<br/>changes, however, these same chains of generators can prduce intervals<br/>of quite another color, as they do very pleasantly at 705 cents.</p><p>In fact, augmented and diminished intervals are absolutely vital in<br/>enjoying the diverse forms of a medieval and modern Near Eastern<br/>tuning called Rast -- or, better stated, a family of tunings of which<br/>one was evidently developed in the 8th century by Mansur Zalzal, a<br/>musician in Baghdad who favored a fretting for the &grave;ud (which would<br/>become known in Europe as the lute) later reported by theorists such<br/>as al-Farabi and Ibn-Sina. A 705-cent generator or beta opens the way<br/>to one most agreeable shading of this scale:</p><p> [0, 0]  [-1, 2] [-5, 9] [1, -1]  [0, 1]  [-4, 8]  [2, -2]  [1, 0]<br/>    C       D       D#      F        G       G#       Bb       C<br/>    0      210     345     495      705     840      990      1200<br/>      210      135     150     210      135     150      210</p><p>The first thing to notice about this scale, for those not already<br/>attuned to Near Eastern modes, is purely melodic: the distinctive<br/>steps of 135 and 150 cents somewhere between a semitone and a whole<br/>tone as used in European and Near Eastern music alike. These<br/>intermediate steps are often called &quot;neutral seconds,&quot; and the Turkish<br/>musician and theorist Ozan Yarman calls them simply &quot;middle seconds.&quot;<br/>Whatever we call them, they give Near Eastern modal systems a flavor<br/>and intricacy unknown in traditional European modality or tonality<br/>based on tones and semitones as the only &quot;standard&quot; steps.</p><p>In either the maqam traditions of the Arab world, Turkey, and<br/>Kurdistan, or the Persian dastgah system which has grown out of the<br/>maqam system in recent centuries, the subtleties of pure melodic<br/>development and modulation have been the main focus, rather than<br/>harmony for two or more voices. However, musicians within these<br/>traditions are now exploring a range of harmonic possibilities, while<br/>the maqam and dastgah traditions can enrich the melodic and harmonic<br/>resources of musicians coming from other backgrounds.</p><p>In maqam theory, Rast is at one level the name for a tetrachord, or<br/>division of the fourth, with a major second; a neutral or middle third<br/>somewhere between minor and major, and a fourth -- here 0-210-345-495<br/>cents. In Zalzal&apos;s version of Rast, known in modern Arab theory as<br/>Nirz Rast, there are two such tetrachords, here at C-D-D#-F and<br/>F-G-G#-Bb. The fourth degree of the scale F, the top of the first<br/>tetrachord, is also the lowest note of the second -- an arrangement of<br/>what are termed _conjunct_ tetrachords. An octave consists of these<br/>two tetrachords plus an upper major second or tone Bb-C.</p><p>              Rast                    Rast               tone<br/>    |-----------------------|-------------------------|........|<br/>    C       D       D#      F        G       G#       Bb       C<br/>    0      210     345     495      705     840      990      1200<br/>      210      135     150     210      135     150      210</p><p>In the medieval and modern Near East, as in medieval Europe, tuning in<br/>pure fifths and fourths is an important musical current of intonation:<br/>thus al-Farabi gives some of the intervals in Zalzal&apos;s scale as<br/>Pythagorean ratios built from primes 2-3 only. Above the lowest step,<br/>these include the 9:8 tone C-D, the 4:3 fourth C-F, the 3:2 fifth C-G,<br/>and the 16:9 minor seventh C-Bb (at 204, 498, 702, and 996 cents). In<br/>our 705-cent tuning, the fifth is wide of pure by about 3 cents, and<br/>we find more generally that regular major intervals are larger, and<br/>minor intervals smaller, than their Pythagorean sizes.</p><p>Our special focus here is on the neutral or middle intervals of<br/>Zalzal&apos;s scale, which in a rendition with a 705-cent generator often<br/>take on sizes very close to simple JI ratios. Thus the neutral third<br/>C-D# at 345 cents is very close to 11:9 (347 cents); while the neutral<br/>sixth C-G# at 840 cents gives a virtually just 13:8, the &quot;harmonic<br/>sixth&quot; based on the 13th partial.</p><p>As it happens, al-Farabi gives Zalzal&apos;s neutral third and sixth as the<br/>ratios 27:22 and 18:11, or 355 and 853 cents -- somewhat larger and<br/>&quot;brighter&quot; than in our 705-cent version on C. A different mapping<br/>would give us intervals at 360 and 855 cents, quite close to<br/>al-Farabi&apos;s version.</p><p>In the Zalzal tuning on C, our neutral third and sixth very close to<br/>11:9 and 13:8 tell us that 705 cents is a good generator for the 11th<br/>and 13th partials. We find these near-just approximation of 11 and 13<br/>involved in the fine tuning of other intervals also. Thus the regular<br/>minor third D-F at 285 cents is close to 13:11 (289 cents), and yet<br/>closer to the more complex 33:28, also based on 11 prime, at 284<br/>cents. A regular major third such as Bb-D at 420 cents is very close<br/>to 14:11 (418 cents).</p><p>These regular thirds serve nicely, like their Pythagorean counterparts<br/>at 81:64 and 32:27 (408 and 294 cents), as relatively concordant but<br/>active intervals often resolving in directed progressions to stable<br/>intervals such as fifths -- as we saw in the previous section. Thus<br/>it&apos;s possible to use a generator of 705 cents, much like one of 702<br/>cents, for much of the medieval European repertory, including the<br/>complex part-writing of the 12th-14th centuries.</p><p>From this point of view, we can describe this territory as<br/>&quot;supra-Pythagorean&quot; -- rather like Pythagorean, but involving a yet<br/>larger fifth or generator, so that major intervals are wider and minor<br/>ones narrower. Although much beautiful music can be made using only<br/>the &quot;regular diatonic&quot; intervals known to standard medieval European<br/>theory, the neutral intervals add a new element to the mix -- or<br/>actually a very traditional one in Near Eastern music for the last<br/>millennium and more.</p><p>Exploring a few progressions in our Zalzalian Rast scale will<br/>highlight various sides of this exciting equation. Here we&apos;ll focus on<br/>one characteristic form of cadence taken from a 13th-14th century<br/>European style: a three-voice cadence where a third expands to a fifth<br/>and a sixth to an octave, bringing us to a 2-3-4 chord. At 705 cents,<br/>the 3:2 fifth is tempered about 3 cents wide, and the 4:3 fourth about<br/>3 cents narrow -- a tempering about half again as great as in 12-tET,<br/>but rather less than in many meantone tunings where 4-7 cents of<br/>impurity may prevail.</p><p>Interestingly, this form of cadence on our resting note or final C<br/>involves only the usual Pythagorean -- or supra-Pythagorean -- steps<br/>and intervals:</p><p>                Bb      C<br/>                F       G<br/>                D       C</p><p>The minor third and sixth at 285 cents and 780 cents, the latter close<br/>to the simple ratio of 11:7 and former, as we have noted, to 13:11 or<br/>33:28, expand smoothly to the fifth and octave, each voice moving by<br/>an ample whole tone of 210 cents, a bit larger than the 9:8 of<br/>Pythagorean tuning at 204 cents. Whole-tone motion in all voices is<br/>characteristic of many cadences favored during the 13th century in<br/>Europe; by around 1300, there is an increasing desire that decisive<br/>cadences should involve ascending or descending semitonal motion in<br/>one or more of the parts, a policy that mostly remains in place until<br/>the period around 1900.</p><p>To make a regular cadence on a given step of our scale in this<br/>approach, we need to have a regular fifth available above it, so that<br/>we can form a 2-3-4 chord as the goal of our cadence. Five of the<br/>seven degrees of our Zalzal scale meet this test: C, F, G, G#, and Bb.<br/>We found that the cadence on C nicely fits a conventional 13th-century<br/>European style; the others each add something new, melodic or<br/>harmonic, drawing on our neutral intervals.</p><p>The cadence on F introduces a close approximation of another just<br/>interval:</p><p>                D#      F<br/>                Bb      C<br/>                G       F</p><p>Our opening chord has a minor third G-Bb at 285 cents plus our 13:8<br/>neutral sixth G-D# at 840 cents -- actually an augmented fifth built<br/>from eight fifths up less four octaves [-4, 8]. The two upper voices<br/>thus form a &quot;superfourth&quot; or small tritone at 555 cents, very close to<br/>the 11:8 (551 cents) based on the 11th partial. Melodically, the two<br/>lower voices proceed as in the previous cadence on C, expanding<br/>stepwise from minor third to fifth with each moving by a 210-cent<br/>tone. The upper voice, however, ascends by a distinctive neutral<br/>second at 150 cents -- a virtually just 12:11 (151 cents) also given<br/>by al-Farabi as one of the melodic intervals in his version of<br/>Zalzal&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Both the outer 13:8 sixth and the near-11:8 superfourth between the<br/>upper voices (an excellent name suggested by David Keenan) give this<br/>cadence a special flavor. Now let us move to the cadence on G:</p><p>                F      G<br/>                C      D<br/>                G#     G</p><p>Harmonically, this cadence introduces us to the intervals of the<br/>diminished fourth G#-C [4, -8] at 360 cents, a virtually just 16:13<br/>(359 cents), and the diminished seventh G#-F [-5, +9] at 855 cents,<br/>quite close to al-Farabi&apos;s ratio of 18:11 or 853 cents in his version<br/>of Zalzal&apos;s scale. The 16:13 diminished fourth or neutral third<br/>between the lower voices expands to a fifth with the lowest voice<br/>descending by a 135-cent chromatic semitone G#-G [-4, +7] or neutral<br/>second rather close to 13:12 (139 cents), and the middle voice<br/>ascending by a 210-cent tone. The outer voices likewise resolve from<br/>the 855-cent neutral sixth to an octave, the upper voice like the<br/>middle one ascending by a 210-cent tone.</p><p>Again, both the harmonic neutral intervals, and the neutral second<br/>step in the lowest voice, provide radically new resources for those<br/>not already accustomed to them, while illustrating how the same chain<br/>of generators can have different musical uses as the tuning changes.<br/>At 702 cents, the same diminished fourth and seventh G#-C-F would<br/>produce a chord at 0-384-882 cents, with a &quot;schismatic&quot; major third<br/>and sixth very close to a just 5:4 and 5:3 (0-386-884 cents); here, we<br/>get neutral intervals very close to a just 16:13 and 18:11.</p><p>The cadence on G# brings into a play a delightful feature of scales<br/>and modes with neutral steps which George Secor noted in 1978 when<br/>exploring his 17-tone well-temperament, and which a regular<br/>temperament at 705 cents likewise illustrates:</p><p>               G     G#<br/>               D     D#<br/>               Bb    G#</p><p>The opening chord is a typical Pythagorean or supra-Pythagorean<br/>structure with a major third at 420 cents and major sixth at 915<br/>cents, close to 14:11 and 56:33 (418 and 916 cents). In a 13th-14th<br/>century European style, this chord often resolves to A-E-A, with the<br/>lowest voice descending by a usual diatonic semitone (Bb-A) where the<br/>upper voices each ascend by a tone. Here, however, the resolution is<br/>quite different.</p><p>Each voice moved by some flavor of middle or neutral second: the<br/>lowest descending by the 150-cent step Bb-G#, almost a just 12:11; and<br/>the upper voices ascending by 135-cent steps, D-D# and G-G#. The<br/>150-cent step is formed by a diminished third at ten generators down<br/>plus six octaves [6, -10]; and the smaller 135-cent step by the<br/>chromatic semitone, equal to seven generators up less four octaves<br/>[-4, 7].</p><p>Secor has aptly suggested that this type of progression be called an<br/>_equable_ cadence. The idea is that in order for a major third to<br/>expand to a fifth (here Bb-D to G#-D#), or a major sixth to an octave<br/>(Bb-G to G#-G#), the two voices involved must together move by the<br/>total of a minor third -- here 285 cents, the difference between a<br/>420-cent major third and a 705-cent fifth; or a 915-cent major sixth<br/>and a 1200-cent octave.</p><p>In the equable cadence, this motion is divided &quot;equably&quot; between the<br/>voices so that each moves by some size of neutral second: here by<br/>steps of 150 and 135 cents. Secor&apos;s term was borrowed from the<br/>&quot;Equable Diatonic&quot; tuning of Ptolemy, which divides a fourth into<br/>string ratios of 12:11:10:9 (0-151-316-498 cents). In that tuning, a<br/>minor third at 6:5 or 12:10 (316 cents) is divided into two neutral<br/>second steps at 12:11 (151 cents) and 11:10 (165 cents).</p><p>Here the division of the smaller 285-cent third into steps of 135 and<br/>150 cents is rather close to another just intonation (JI) division:<br/>13:12:11, where a 13:11 third at 289 cents is divided into steps of<br/>13:12 at 139 cents and 12:11 at 150 cents.</p><p>Musically, the equable cadence has a quality strikingly different from<br/>anything in a mode based on tones and semitones alone. It is one<br/>result of a &quot;fusion&quot; style combining Near Eastern modes and neutral<br/>second steps with some general cadential principles coming from<br/>medieval Europe.</p><p>Finally, to complete our tour of cadences, we a cadence to Bb, the<br/>seventh degree of this Zalzalian Rast:</p><p>            G#    Bb<br/>            D#    F<br/>            C     Bb</p><p>Here the opening chord has a 345-cent neutral third plus an 840-cent<br/>neutral sixth, very close as we have seen to 11:9 and 13:8; the lower<br/>voice descends by a whole tone, while each upper voice ascends by a<br/>150-cent neutral second.</p><p>This quick tour of cadences may suggest the diversity of colors and<br/>subtle variations available in our 705-cent temperament. Neutral<br/>second steps at 135 or 150 cents, neutral thirds at 345 or 360 cents,<br/>and neutral sixths at 840 or 855 cents are largely interchangeable,<br/>and yet subtly different. Fortunately, the Thummer&apos;s 19 notes per<br/>octave provide room both for enjoying this diversity, and sometimes<br/>for making musically significant choices.</p><p>For example, a mode or pattern known in the Arab world as Maqam<br/>Bayyati and in the Persian dastgah system as Shur Dastgah, has a lower<br/>tetrachord where a minor third above the resting note or final is<br/>divided into two neutral seconds -- Secor&apos;s equable division. In both<br/>Arab and Persian practice, there is a general preference that the<br/>smaller neutral second step should precede or be placed below the<br/>larger. To follow this convention, we can choose from among eight<br/>positions with this ordering where a smaller 135-cent step precedes a<br/>larger 150-cent one, for example:</p><p> [0, 0]  [-4, 7]  [2, -3] [1, -1]  [0, 1]  [3, -4]  [2, -2]  [1, 0]<br/>    C       C#      Eb       F        G       Ab       Bb       C<br/>    0      135     285      495      705     780      990      1200<br/>       135     150     210      210       75      210      210</p><p>Interestingly, obtaining neutral intervals in our 705-cent tuning<br/>based on often quite accurate approximations of primes 2-3-11-13<br/>involves the same generator chains we would use around 702 cents or<br/>Pythagoran tuning for &quot;schismatic&quot; intervals at or very close to<br/>ratios of 2-3-5 (e.g. 5:4 and 6:5 thirds).</p><p>Like the Pythagorean region around 702 cents, our 705-cent tuning<br/>offers some nice approximations of Archytan intervals based on primes<br/>2-3-7 -- but uses long generator chains for this purpose. Fortunately,<br/>these chains are slightly shorter at 705 cents; and we have the<br/>additional advantage of being able to combine these 2-3-7 intervals<br/>with a wealth of neutral intervals available here, but not at 702<br/>cents, within a 19-note tuning set.</p><p>Let us quickly consider a beautiful tuning of the Persian philosopher<br/>and music theorist Ibn Sina, who described it in the earlier 11th<br/>century. According to John Chalmers, this tuning is based on a<br/>tetrachord of 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3 (0-128-139-498 cents), with the<br/>smaller 14:13 neutral second below the larger 13:12 step. George Secor<br/>has discussed a very similar tuning in which the larger 13:12 step<br/>comes first, forming a tetrachord of 12:13:14:16 (0-139-267-498<br/>cents). Our 705-cent tuning offers a solution which &quot;splits the<br/>difference&quot; between these two versions:</p><p>  [0, 0] [-4, 7] [-8, 14] [1, -1]  [0, 1] [-4, 8] [-8, 15]  [1, 0]<br/>    Db      D       D#       Gb      Ab      A       A#       Db<br/>    0      135     270      495     705     840     975      1200<br/>      135     135      225      210     135     135     225</p><p>Here we have a special kind of equable division: the 270-cent minor<br/>third, very close to a just 7:6 or 267 cents, is divided into two<br/>identical 135-cent neutral seconds. This kind of precisely equal<br/>division may be more typical of modern tuning systems than of the<br/>classical understanding of a theorist such as Ptolemy or Ibn Sina,<br/>where equable divisions often involve ratios of adjoining integers (or<br/>also, partials, in modern harmonic series terms) such as 12-13-14,<br/>which always produce somewhat unequal steps.</p><p>When Archytan or 2-3-7 and neutral intervals are combined, some<br/>memorable cadences become available which would not otherwise be<br/>possible.

In this equable cadence,<br/>the minor seventh contracts to a fifth and each minor third to a<br/>unison, with each voice moving by an identical neutral second step of<br/>135 cents!</p><p>Another directed two-voice resolution in this cadence might not be so<br/>obvious: the expansion of the middle pair of voices from a large major<br/>third D#-Ab at 435 cents to a fifth D-A, likewise with 135-cent steps<br/>in each voice. This major third is at an almost perfectly just 9:7<br/>(435.084 cents), which like the smaller neutral sixth at 840 cents (by<br/>comparison to 13:8 at 840.528 cents) is a special attraction of the<br/>705-cent temperament, quite apart from its easy arithmetic with<br/>conveniently rounded interval sizes in cents.</p><p>To highlight this 9:7 major third, let&apos;s change the arrangement of the<br/>voices:</p><p>              Db     D<br/>              A#     A<br/>              Ab     A<br/>              D#     D</p><p>Now our opening chord is 0-435-705-930 cents or approximately<br/>14:18:21:24, with the active and outgoing 9:7 third and the major<br/>sixth quite close to 12:7 (933 cents) expanding to the fifth and<br/>octave of a complete 2-3-4 chord (D-A-D).</p><p>This seven-note scale also includes within it a slendro tuning<br/>featuring an interval of 480 cents, interestingly the same narrow<br/>fourth occurring in 5-EDO, which might be taken as one starting point<br/>for the subtly unequal gamelan tunings which obtain in practice:</p><p>   [0, 0]  [-1, 2]  [-9, 16]  [0, 1]  [-8, 15]  [1, 0]<br/>     Gb       Ab       A#       Db       D#       Gb<br/>     0        210      480     705      975      1200<br/>         210      270      225     270      225</p><p>A just 2-3-7 prime version would be 1/1-9/8-21/16-3/2-7/4-2/1 or<br/>0-204-471-702-969-1200 cents, formed by partials 16:18:21:24:28:32.<br/>While the idea of tuning a gamelan based on just ratios is more an<br/>aspect of recent international developments than of traditional<br/>Javanese or Balinese practice, small fourths around 470-490 cents are<br/>very typical of traditional slendro tunings.</p><p>Returning to seven-note scales, I should emphasize that while my<br/>discussion has focused on a &quot;neomedieval fusion&quot; style combining<br/>aspects of medieval European and Near Eastern practices, scales<br/>combining neutral intervals with supra-Pythagorean or Archytan ones<br/>are by no means limited to this application.</p><p>George Secor, in his article focusing on his own 17-tone<br/>well-temperament, gives a number of scales which can be nicely<br/>approximated using a 705-cent generator, describing their use for<br/>example in a kind of &quot;four-part xenharmony&quot; in some ways curiously<br/>analogous to 18th-19th century European tonality.

He is not addressing, for<br/>&gt; example, the tuning of keyboard instruments, but the rather the art of<br/>&gt; that most flexible instrument: the human voice.</p><p>Yes indeed.</p><p>&gt; What he seems to be describing is a system of Pythagorean intonation,<br/>&gt; or something very like it, which however may be and indeed should be<br/>&gt; modified in directed polyphonic progressions by contrary motion which<br/>&gt; involve certain accidental alterations. These alterations make major<br/>&gt; third expanding to fifths or major sixths expanding to octaves larger,<br/>&gt; and ascending melodic semitones smaller, than in regular Pythagorean<br/>&gt; intonation.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; Exactly how much smaller or larger, as George Secor and I and many<br/>&gt; others have asked, is the more problematic question. Since we&apos;re<br/>&gt; dealing with voices, by nature variable, it might be a moot question.</p><p>But we can have a lot of fun trying to figure out how large Marchetto<br/>was trying to tell us it should be. It seems he had theorised<br/>something fairly specific, even if he wasn&apos;t very good at explaining<br/>it in terms that could be understood hundreds of years later.</p><p>&gt; Note that while Marchettus seems to take Pythagorean intonation as the<br/>&gt; basis for his system, this important modification moves in the<br/>&gt; opposite direction from the 5-limit tendencies<br/>...</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; While the mathematics of Marchettus may not always be clear, and some<br/>&gt; of the measurements he invokes can be mutually contradictory, the<br/>&gt; musical intent seems much clearer to me: extra-wide major thirds and<br/>&gt; sixths in cadences involving what we would now term sharps.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; He says<br/>&gt; that the regular semitone or limma, 256:243 or 90 cents in Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning, is equal to &quot;two parts&quot; of a tone;</p><p>I&apos;ve only seen where he refers to an &quot;enharmonic&quot; semitone as being<br/>&quot;two parts&quot; of a tone (out of his 5 unequal parts). Does he actually<br/>refer to it as a &quot;regular semitone&quot; in any sense? Does he actually<br/>refer to it as a limma, or as 256:243?</p><p>I still see no way to decide between about 68 cents and about 90 cents<br/>for his &quot;enharmonic&quot; semitone. As explained in my previous post<br/>responding to Monz.</p><p>&gt; but that in these<br/>&gt; progressions, an especially small interval called a &quot;diesis&quot; is used<br/>&gt; including only &quot;one&quot; of the five parts of a tone.</p><p>I find it most likely that this diesis is in th erange 43 to 48 cents,<br/>not the comma-sized &quot;diesis&quot;, and not an equal 5-part division of the<br/>tone (40 cents).</p><p>&gt; If these &quot;parts&quot; are approximately equal, as _some_ of his theory<br/>&gt; might fairly suggest,</p><p>How is that suggested? What would be the point of first dividing the<br/>tone into 9 (or 8) if the aim was an approximately equal 5-fold division?</p><p>&gt; then an interpretation like this might result:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A more nuanced interpretation is that maybe the extra-wide major<br/>&gt; thirds and sixth have approximately septimal ratios around 9:7 and<br/>&gt; 12:7, which might lead to something like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop001.ogg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop001.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop020.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop020.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t see any evidence for a 7-limit interpretation either.</p><p>&gt; In the moderate view, using a system of approximately nine commas to a<br/>&gt; 9:8 tone at 204 cents, the metrics in practice of the intervals<br/>&gt; discussed by Marchettus might be as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;         Interval                            commas  cents  notation<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;    diesis, cadential modification of limma    3      67    C#-D, G#-A<br/>&gt;    limma, &quot;enharmonic&quot; or regular semitone    4      90    B-C, A-Bb<br/>&gt;    apotome, &quot;diatonic&quot; semitone               5     114    Bb-B<br/>&gt;    chroma, cadential chromatic step           6     137    C-C#, G-G#<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I can see that his enharmonic and diatonic may be 4 and 5 commas<br/>respectively. They could also be 3 and 6 commas respectively. But I do<br/>not agree that his chromatic semitone could be as small as 6 commas.<br/>Doesn&apos;t he clearly state that his chromatic semitone corresponds to 4<br/>of his dieses, and that there are 5 of his dieses in a whole-tone.</p><p>You would need to group the 9 commas _very_ unevenly into 5 &quot;dieses&quot;,<br/>to make 4 dieses encompass 6 commas. You would need to have 3 dieses<br/>of a single comma, and two dieses of 3 commas, within the tone.</p><p>I think it&apos;s fairly clear that he groups the commas as 1, 2, 2, 2, 2.<br/>At least I see no suggestion of 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 or 3, 1, 1, 1, 3. Nor do<br/>I accept Jay Rahn&apos;s argument for 2, 2, 1, 2, 2.</p><p>So I find that his chromatic semitone is most likely to be 7 commas<br/>(around 159 cents) and the remaining diesis 2 commas (around 45 cents).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As George Secor and I have noted -- both with a great liking for this<br/>&gt; kind of septimal flavor -- one could arrive at this kind of reading by<br/>&gt; taking a certain interpretation of a comment by Marchettus that the<br/>&gt; wide cadential major sixth is at an equal distance from the fifth and<br/>&gt; the octave. If this means an arithmetic division on a monochord, we<br/>&gt; get 12:8:6 for the division of the octave into a lower fifth and upper<br/>&gt; fourth; and then 8:7:6 for the division of the upper fourth into two<br/>&gt; equal lengths, so that the cadential major sixth has a ratio of about<br/>&gt; 12:7 (933 cents). Thus see:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &lt;<a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/marchetmf.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/marchetmf.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &lt;<a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my view this reading is both consistent with the general spirit of<br/>&gt; this treatise,</p><p>Yes. I agree that&apos;s a possible reading.</p><p>&gt; and musically effective -- but a more dramatic reading<br/>&gt; is also possible, and in line with some other mathematical cues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When Marchettus says that the cadential major sixth differs by &quot;six<br/>&gt; dieses&quot; from either a fifth or an octave, that suggests comparably<br/>&gt; sized units.</p><p>Yes it does.</p><p>&gt; If so, then some expansion of the usual Pythagorean major<br/>&gt; third and sixth by something rather more than a comma -- closer to two<br/>&gt; commas -- seems indicated.</p><p>Why not exactly two commas?</p><p>&gt; A comparatively moderate reading arguably<br/>&gt; fitting this general model could suggest a division like 12:11 for the<br/>&gt; chroma and 33:32 for the diesis (151 and 53 cents), or about 6-1/2 and<br/>&gt; 2-1/2 commas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one wants a theoretically attractive model realizable on a<br/>&gt; monochord, Jay Rahn&apos;s seems about as good as any:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     diaschisma   diaschisma comma diaschisma  diaschisma<br/>&gt;   |------------|-----------|-----|----------|-----------|<br/>&gt;  81           79          77    76         74          72<br/>&gt;        43           44       23       46        47<br/>&gt;   |------------------------|<br/>&gt;     limma  =  2 parts -- 87<br/>&gt;   |------------------------------|<br/>&gt;     apotome = 3 parts -- 110<br/>&gt;   |-----------------------------------------|------------|<br/>&gt;     chroma =  4 part s --  156                diesis = 47<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The advantage of this scheme is that it agrees with the classic<br/>&gt; doctrine of Philolaus, as reported by Boethius, that the tone may be<br/>&gt; divided into four diaschismata (each equal to half of a limma, or<br/>&gt; about 45.11 cents) plus a comma (531441:524288, or 23.46 cents).<br/>&gt; Note that this is only one meaning of the term &quot;diaschisma&quot; (plural<br/>&gt; &quot;diaschismata&quot;), and &quot;demi-limma&quot; would be a good synonym. If the<br/>&gt; comma is the middle of the &quot;five parts&quot; at 77:76, its size is slightly<br/>&gt; smaller than 23 cents, and indeed, as Scala notes, very close to 1/53<br/>&gt; octave (Ozan&apos;s &quot;Holdrian comma&quot;).<br/>&gt; If a comma is taken as about half of a diaschisma, or a quarter of a<br/>&gt; limma, then this &quot;fivefold division&quot; of a tone can be treated as an<br/>&gt; approximate &quot;ninefold division,&quot; with two commas to each of the four<br/>&gt; diaschismata, plus another comma to complete the tone.</p><p>This is all well and good, except that I believe Marchetto puts the<br/>single-comma &quot;diesis&quot; at one end, not in the middle, based on that<br/>passage that Monz and I have been discussing.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t invalidate the sizes suggested here (within +-3 cents)<br/>but it does upen up the possibility of the enharmonic being 3 commas<br/>and the diatonic being 6.</p><p>&gt; The main problem with this admirably elegant solution is that it<br/>&gt; requires greatly unequal dieses --</p><p>But Marchettos _says_ they are unequal.

However,<br/>&gt; the &quot;six dieses&quot; observation would remain valid under this solution if<br/>&gt; we reasonably take &quot;six dieses&quot; to mean &quot;a regular 9:8 tone or five<br/>&gt; dieses, plus a sixth diesis equal to a diaschisma or demi-limma -- in<br/>&gt; other words, roughly 11 commas.&quot; Since a fourth consists of about 22<br/>&gt; commas, and marks the distance from a 3:2 fifth to a 2:1 octave, the<br/>&gt; cadential major sixth at about 11 commas from either (say about 951<br/>&gt; cents, or 26:15 or 64:37 in JI/RI terms) would nicely fulfill this<br/>&gt; description.</p><p>Aha!

The world at 705 cents: neutral intervals<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In our 19-tET gamelan tuning, we used an augmented second [-5, 9] and<br/>&gt; augmented sixth [-5, 10] to produce the small 253-cent minor third and<br/>&gt; 948-cent minor seventh in this shading of slendro. As the tuning<br/>&gt; changes, however, these same chains of generators can prduce intervals<br/>&gt; of quite another color, as they do very pleasantly at 705 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, augmented and diminished intervals are absolutely vital in<br/>&gt; enjoying the diverse forms of a medieval and modern Near Eastern<br/>&gt; tuning called Rast -- or, better stated, a family of tunings of which<br/>&gt; one was evidently developed in the 8th century by Mansur Zalzal, a<br/>&gt; musician in Baghdad who favored a fretting for the &grave;ud (which would<br/>&gt; become known in Europe as the lute) later reported by theorists such<br/>&gt; as al-Farabi and Ibn-Sina. A 705-cent generator or beta opens the way<br/>&gt; to one most agreeable shading of this scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [0, 0]  [-1, 2] [-5, 9] [1, -1]  [0, 1]  [-4, 8]  [2, -2]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;    C       D       D#      F        G       G#       Bb       C<br/>&gt;    0      210     345     495      705     840      990      1200<br/>&gt;      210      135     150     210      135     150      210<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first thing to notice about this scale, for those not already<br/>&gt; attuned to Near Eastern modes, is purely melodic: the distinctive<br/>&gt; steps of 135 and 150 cents somewhere between a semitone and a whole<br/>&gt; tone as used in European and Near Eastern music alike. These<br/>&gt; intermediate steps are often called &quot;neutral seconds,&quot; and the Turkish<br/>&gt; musician and theorist Ozan Yarman calls them simply &quot;middle seconds.&quot;<br/>&gt; Whatever we call them, they give Near Eastern modal systems a flavor<br/>&gt; and intricacy unknown in traditional European modality or tonality<br/>&gt; based on tones and semitones as the only &quot;standard&quot; steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In either the maqam traditions of the Arab world, Turkey, and<br/>&gt; Kurdistan, or the Persian dastgah system which has grown out of the<br/>&gt; maqam system in recent centuries, the subtleties of pure melodic<br/>&gt; development and modulation have been the main focus, rather than<br/>&gt; harmony for two or more voices. However, musicians within these<br/>&gt; traditions are now exploring a range of harmonic possibilities, while<br/>&gt; the maqam and dastgah traditions can enrich the melodic and harmonic<br/>&gt; resources of musicians coming from other backgrounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In maqam theory, Rast is at one level the name for a tetrachord, or<br/>&gt; division of the fourth, with a major second; a neutral or middle third<br/>&gt; somewhere between minor and major, and a fourth -- here 0-210-345-495<br/>&gt; cents. In Zalzal&apos;s version of Rast, known in modern Arab theory as<br/>&gt; Nirz Rast, there are two such tetrachords, here at C-D-D#-F and<br/>&gt; F-G-G#-Bb. The fourth degree of the scale F, the top of the first<br/>&gt; tetrachord, is also the lowest note of the second -- an arrangement of<br/>&gt; what are termed _conjunct_ tetrachords. An octave consists of these<br/>&gt; two tetrachords plus an upper major second or tone Bb-C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              Rast                    Rast               tone<br/>&gt;    |-----------------------|-------------------------|........|<br/>&gt;    C       D       D#      F        G       G#       Bb       C<br/>&gt;    0      210     345     495      705     840      990      1200<br/>&gt;      210      135     150     210      135     150      210<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the medieval and modern Near East, as in medieval Europe, tuning in<br/>&gt; pure fifths and fourths is an important musical current of intonation:<br/>&gt; thus al-Farabi gives some of the intervals in Zalzal&apos;s scale as<br/>&gt; Pythagorean ratios built from primes 2-3 only. Above the lowest step,<br/>&gt; these include the 9:8 tone C-D, the 4:3 fourth C-F, the 3:2 fifth C-G,<br/>&gt; and the 16:9 minor seventh C-Bb (at 204, 498, 702, and 996 cents). In<br/>&gt; our 705-cent tuning, the fifth is wide of pure by about 3 cents, and<br/>&gt; we find more generally that regular major intervals are larger, and<br/>&gt; minor intervals smaller, than their Pythagorean sizes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Our special focus here is on the neutral or middle intervals of<br/>&gt; Zalzal&apos;s scale, which in a rendition with a 705-cent generator often<br/>&gt; take on sizes very close to simple JI ratios. Thus the neutral third<br/>&gt; C-D# at 345 cents is very close to 11:9 (347 cents); while the neutral<br/>&gt; sixth C-G# at 840 cents gives a virtually just 13:8, the &quot;harmonic<br/>&gt; sixth&quot; based on the 13th partial.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As it happens, al-Farabi gives Zalzal&apos;s neutral third and sixth as the<br/>&gt; ratios 27:22 and 18:11, or 355 and 853 cents -- somewhat larger and<br/>&gt; &quot;brighter&quot; than in our 705-cent version on C. A different mapping<br/>&gt; would give us intervals at 360 and 855 cents, quite close to<br/>&gt; al-Farabi&apos;s version.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the Zalzal tuning on C, our neutral third and sixth very close to<br/>&gt; 11:9 and 13:8 tell us that 705 cents is a good generator for the 11th<br/>&gt; and 13th partials. We find these near-just approximation of 11 and 13<br/>&gt; involved in the fine tuning of other intervals also. Thus the regular<br/>&gt; minor third D-F at 285 cents is close to 13:11 (289 cents), and yet<br/>&gt; closer to the more complex 33:28, also based on 11 prime, at 284<br/>&gt; cents. A regular major third such as Bb-D at 420 cents is very close<br/>&gt; to 14:11 (418 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These regular thirds serve nicely, like their Pythagorean counterparts<br/>&gt; at 81:64 and 32:27 (408 and 294 cents), as relatively concordant but<br/>&gt; active intervals often resolving in directed progressions to stable<br/>&gt; intervals such as fifths -- as we saw in the previous section. Thus<br/>&gt; it&apos;s possible to use a generator of 705 cents, much like one of 702<br/>&gt; cents, for much of the medieval European repertory, including the<br/>&gt; complex part-writing of the 12th-14th centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From this point of view, we can describe this territory as<br/>&gt; &quot;supra-Pythagorean&quot; -- rather like Pythagorean, but involving a yet<br/>&gt; larger fifth or generator, so that major intervals are wider and minor<br/>&gt; ones narrower. Although much beautiful music can be made using only<br/>&gt; the &quot;regular diatonic&quot; intervals known to standard medieval European<br/>&gt; theory, the neutral intervals add a new element to the mix -- or<br/>&gt; actually a very traditional one in Near Eastern music for the last<br/>&gt; millennium and more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exploring a few progressions in our Zalzalian Rast scale will<br/>&gt; highlight various sides of this exciting equation. Here we&apos;ll focus on<br/>&gt; one characteristic form of cadence taken from a 13th-14th century<br/>&gt; European style: a three-voice cadence where a third expands to a fifth<br/>&gt; and a sixth to an octave, bringing us to a 2-3-4 chord. At 705 cents,<br/>&gt; the 3:2 fifth is tempered about 3 cents wide, and the 4:3 fourth about<br/>&gt; 3 cents narrow -- a tempering about half again as great as in 12-tET,<br/>&gt; but rather less than in many meantone tunings where 4-7 cents of<br/>&gt; impurity may prevail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly, this form of cadence on our resting note or final C<br/>&gt; involves only the usual Pythagorean -- or supra-Pythagorean -- steps<br/>&gt; and intervals:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                Bb      C<br/>&gt;                F       G<br/>&gt;                D       C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The minor third and sixth at 285 cents and 780 cents, the latter close<br/>&gt; to the simple ratio of 11:7 and former, as we have noted, to 13:11 or<br/>&gt; 33:28, expand smoothly to the fifth and octave, each voice moving by<br/>&gt; an ample whole tone of 210 cents, a bit larger than the 9:8 of<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning at 204 cents. Whole-tone motion in all voices is<br/>&gt; characteristic of many cadences favored during the 13th century in<br/>&gt; Europe; by around 1300, there is an increasing desire that decisive<br/>&gt; cadences should involve ascending or descending semitonal motion in<br/>&gt; one or more of the parts, a policy that mostly remains in place until<br/>&gt; the period around 1900.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To make a regular cadence on a given step of our scale in this<br/>&gt; approach, we need to have a regular fifth available above it, so that<br/>&gt; we can form a 2-3-4 chord as the goal of our cadence. Five of the<br/>&gt; seven degrees of our Zalzal scale meet this test: C, F, G, G#, and Bb.<br/>&gt; We found that the cadence on C nicely fits a conventional 13th-century<br/>&gt; European style; the others each add something new, melodic or<br/>&gt; harmonic, drawing on our neutral intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The cadence on F introduces a close approximation of another just<br/>&gt; interval:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                D#      F<br/>&gt;                Bb      C<br/>&gt;                G       F<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Our opening chord has a minor third G-Bb at 285 cents plus our 13:8<br/>&gt; neutral sixth G-D# at 840 cents -- actually an augmented fifth built<br/>&gt; from eight fifths up less four octaves [-4, 8]. The two upper voices<br/>&gt; thus form a &quot;superfourth&quot; or small tritone at 555 cents, very close to<br/>&gt; the 11:8 (551 cents) based on the 11th partial. Melodically, the two<br/>&gt; lower voices proceed as in the previous cadence on C, expanding<br/>&gt; stepwise from minor third to fifth with each moving by a 210-cent<br/>&gt; tone. The upper voice, however, ascends by a distinctive neutral<br/>&gt; second at 150 cents -- a virtually just 12:11 (151 cents) also given<br/>&gt; by al-Farabi as one of the melodic intervals in his version of<br/>&gt; Zalzal&apos;s tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both the outer 13:8 sixth and the near-11:8 superfourth between the<br/>&gt; upper voices (an excellent name suggested by David Keenan) give this<br/>&gt; cadence a special flavor. Now let us move to the cadence on G:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                F      G<br/>&gt;                C      D<br/>&gt;                G#     G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonically, this cadence introduces us to the intervals of the<br/>&gt; diminished fourth G#-C [4, -8] at 360 cents, a virtually just 16:13<br/>&gt; (359 cents), and the diminished seventh G#-F [-5, +9] at 855 cents,<br/>&gt; quite close to al-Farabi&apos;s ratio of 18:11 or 853 cents in his version<br/>&gt; of Zalzal&apos;s scale. The 16:13 diminished fourth or neutral third<br/>&gt; between the lower voices expands to a fifth with the lowest voice<br/>&gt; descending by a 135-cent chromatic semitone G#-G [-4, +7] or neutral<br/>&gt; second rather close to 13:12 (139 cents), and the middle voice<br/>&gt; ascending by a 210-cent tone. The outer voices likewise resolve from<br/>&gt; the 855-cent neutral sixth to an octave, the upper voice like the<br/>&gt; middle one ascending by a 210-cent tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, both the harmonic neutral intervals, and the neutral second<br/>&gt; step in the lowest voice, provide radically new resources for those<br/>&gt; not already accustomed to them, while illustrating how the same chain<br/>&gt; of generators can have different musical uses as the tuning changes.<br/>&gt; At 702 cents, the same diminished fourth and seventh G#-C-F would<br/>&gt; produce a chord at 0-384-882 cents, with a &quot;schismatic&quot; major third<br/>&gt; and sixth very close to a just 5:4 and 5:3 (0-386-884 cents); here, we<br/>&gt; get neutral intervals very close to a just 16:13 and 18:11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The cadence on G# brings into a play a delightful feature of scales<br/>&gt; and modes with neutral steps which George Secor noted in 1978 when<br/>&gt; exploring his 17-tone well-temperament, and which a regular<br/>&gt; temperament at 705 cents likewise illustrates:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               G     G#<br/>&gt;               D     D#<br/>&gt;               Bb    G#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The opening chord is a typical Pythagorean or supra-Pythagorean<br/>&gt; structure with a major third at 420 cents and major sixth at 915<br/>&gt; cents, close to 14:11 and 56:33 (418 and 916 cents). In a 13th-14th<br/>&gt; century European style, this chord often resolves to A-E-A, with the<br/>&gt; lowest voice descending by a usual diatonic semitone (Bb-A) where the<br/>&gt; upper voices each ascend by a tone. Here, however, the resolution is<br/>&gt; quite different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each voice moved by some flavor of middle or neutral second: the<br/>&gt; lowest descending by the 150-cent step Bb-G#, almost a just 12:11; and<br/>&gt; the upper voices ascending by 135-cent steps, D-D# and G-G#. The<br/>&gt; 150-cent step is formed by a diminished third at ten generators down<br/>&gt; plus six octaves [6, -10]; and the smaller 135-cent step by the<br/>&gt; chromatic semitone, equal to seven generators up less four octaves<br/>&gt; [-4, 7].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secor has aptly suggested that this type of progression be called an<br/>&gt; _equable_ cadence. The idea is that in order for a major third to<br/>&gt; expand to a fifth (here Bb-D to G#-D#), or a major sixth to an octave<br/>&gt; (Bb-G to G#-G#), the two voices involved must together move by the<br/>&gt; total of a minor third -- here 285 cents, the difference between a<br/>&gt; 420-cent major third and a 705-cent fifth; or a 915-cent major sixth<br/>&gt; and a 1200-cent octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the equable cadence, this motion is divided &quot;equably&quot; between the<br/>&gt; voices so that each moves by some size of neutral second: here by<br/>&gt; steps of 150 and 135 cents. Secor&apos;s term was borrowed from the<br/>&gt; &quot;Equable Diatonic&quot; tuning of Ptolemy, which divides a fourth into<br/>&gt; string ratios of 12:11:10:9 (0-151-316-498 cents). In that tuning, a<br/>&gt; minor third at 6:5 or 12:10 (316 cents) is divided into two neutral<br/>&gt; second steps at 12:11 (151 cents) and 11:10 (165 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the division of the smaller 285-cent third into steps of 135 and<br/>&gt; 150 cents is rather close to another just intonation (JI) division:<br/>&gt; 13:12:11, where a 13:11 third at 289 cents is divided into steps of<br/>&gt; 13:12 at 139 cents and 12:11 at 150 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Musically, the equable cadence has a quality strikingly different from<br/>&gt; anything in a mode based on tones and semitones alone. It is one<br/>&gt; result of a &quot;fusion&quot; style combining Near Eastern modes and neutral<br/>&gt; second steps with some general cadential principles coming from<br/>&gt; medieval Europe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, to complete our tour of cadences, we a cadence to Bb, the<br/>&gt; seventh degree of this Zalzalian Rast:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            G#    Bb<br/>&gt;            D#    F<br/>&gt;            C     Bb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the opening chord has a 345-cent neutral third plus an 840-cent<br/>&gt; neutral sixth, very close as we have seen to 11:9 and 13:8; the lower<br/>&gt; voice descends by a whole tone, while each upper voice ascends by a<br/>&gt; 150-cent neutral second.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This quick tour of cadences may suggest the diversity of colors and<br/>&gt; subtle variations available in our 705-cent temperament. Neutral<br/>&gt; second steps at 135 or 150 cents, neutral thirds at 345 or 360 cents,<br/>&gt; and neutral sixths at 840 or 855 cents are largely interchangeable,<br/>&gt; and yet subtly different. Fortunately, the Thummer&apos;s 19 notes per<br/>&gt; octave provide room both for enjoying this diversity, and sometimes<br/>&gt; for making musically significant choices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, a mode or pattern known in the Arab world as Maqam<br/>&gt; Bayyati and in the Persian dastgah system as Shur Dastgah, has a lower<br/>&gt; tetrachord where a minor third above the resting note or final is<br/>&gt; divided into two neutral seconds -- Secor&apos;s equable division. In both<br/>&gt; Arab and Persian practice, there is a general preference that the<br/>&gt; smaller neutral second step should precede or be placed below the<br/>&gt; larger. To follow this convention, we can choose from among eight<br/>&gt; positions with this ordering where a smaller 135-cent step precedes a<br/>&gt; larger 150-cent one, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [0, 0]  [-4, 7]  [2, -3] [1, -1]  [0, 1]  [3, -4]  [2, -2]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;    C       C#      Eb       F        G       Ab       Bb       C<br/>&gt;    0      135     285      495      705     780      990      1200<br/>&gt;       135     150     210      210       75      210      210<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly, obtaining neutral intervals in our 705-cent tuning<br/>&gt; based on often quite accurate approximations of primes 2-3-11-13<br/>&gt; involves the same generator chains we would use around 702 cents or<br/>&gt; Pythagoran tuning for &quot;schismatic&quot; intervals at or very close to<br/>&gt; ratios of 2-3-5 (e.g. 5:4 and 6:5 thirds).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like the Pythagorean region around 702 cents, our 705-cent tuning<br/>&gt; offers some nice approximations of Archytan intervals based on primes<br/>&gt; 2-3-7 -- but uses long generator chains for this purpose. Fortunately,<br/>&gt; these chains are slightly shorter at 705 cents; and we have the<br/>&gt; additional advantage of being able to combine these 2-3-7 intervals<br/>&gt; with a wealth of neutral intervals available here, but not at 702<br/>&gt; cents, within a 19-note tuning set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let us quickly consider a beautiful tuning of the Persian philosopher<br/>&gt; and music theorist Ibn Sina, who described it in the earlier 11th<br/>&gt; century. According to John Chalmers, this tuning is based on a<br/>&gt; tetrachord of 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3 (0-128-139-498 cents), with the<br/>&gt; smaller 14:13 neutral second below the larger 13:12 step. George Secor<br/>&gt; has discussed a very similar tuning in which the larger 13:12 step<br/>&gt; comes first, forming a tetrachord of 12:13:14:16 (0-139-267-498<br/>&gt; cents). Our 705-cent tuning offers a solution which &quot;splits the<br/>&gt; difference&quot; between these two versions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [0, 0] [-4, 7] [-8, 14] [1, -1]  [0, 1] [-4, 8] [-8, 15]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;    Db      D       D#       Gb      Ab      A       A#       Db<br/>&gt;    0      135     270      495     705     840     975      1200<br/>&gt;      135     135      225      210     135     135     225<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here we have a special kind of equable division: the 270-cent minor<br/>&gt; third, very close to a just 7:6 or 267 cents, is divided into two<br/>&gt; identical 135-cent neutral seconds. This kind of precisely equal<br/>&gt; division may be more typical of modern tuning systems than of the<br/>&gt; classical understanding of a theorist such as Ptolemy or Ibn Sina,<br/>&gt; where equable divisions often involve ratios of adjoining integers (or<br/>&gt; also, partials, in modern harmonic series terms) such as 12-13-14,<br/>&gt; which always produce somewhat unequal steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When Archytan or 2-3-7 and neutral intervals are combined, some<br/>&gt; memorable cadences become available which would not otherwise be<br/>&gt; possible. For example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              A#     A<br/>&gt;              Ab     A<br/>&gt;              D#     D<br/>&gt;              Db     D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The opening chord at 0-270-705-975 cents is not too far from a just<br/>&gt; 12:14:18:21 with a 7:6 minor third, 3:2 fifth, and 7:4 minor seventh<br/>&gt; above the lowest note (0-267-702-969 cents). In this equable cadence,<br/>&gt; the minor seventh contracts to a fifth and each minor third to a<br/>&gt; unison, with each voice moving by an identical neutral second step of<br/>&gt; 135 cents!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another directed two-voice resolution in this cadence might not be so<br/>&gt; obvious: the expansion of the middle pair of voices from a large major<br/>&gt; third D#-Ab at 435 cents to a fifth D-A, likewise with 135-cent steps<br/>&gt; in each voice. This major third is at an almost perfectly just 9:7<br/>&gt; (435.084 cents), which like the smaller neutral sixth at 840 cents (by<br/>&gt; comparison to 13:8 at 840.528 cents) is a special attraction of the<br/>&gt; 705-cent temperament, quite apart from its easy arithmetic with<br/>&gt; conveniently rounded interval sizes in cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To highlight this 9:7 major third, let&apos;s change the arrangement of the<br/>&gt; voices:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              Db     D<br/>&gt;              A#     A<br/>&gt;              Ab     A<br/>&gt;              D#     D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now our opening chord is 0-435-705-930 cents or approximately<br/>&gt; 14:18:21:24, with the active and outgoing 9:7 third and the major<br/>&gt; sixth quite close to 12:7 (933 cents) expanding to the fifth and<br/>&gt; octave of a complete 2-3-4 chord (D-A-D).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seven-note scale also includes within it a slendro tuning<br/>&gt; featuring an interval of 480 cents, interestingly the same narrow<br/>&gt; fourth occurring in 5-EDO, which might be taken as one starting point<br/>&gt; for the subtly unequal gamelan tunings which obtain in practice:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   [0, 0]  [-1, 2]  [-9, 16]  [0, 1]  [-8, 15]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;     Gb       Ab       A#       Db       D#       Gb<br/>&gt;     0        210      480     705      975      1200<br/>&gt;         210      270      225     270      225<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A just 2-3-7 prime version would be 1/1-9/8-21/16-3/2-7/4-2/1 or<br/>&gt; 0-204-471-702-969-1200 cents, formed by partials 16:18:21:24:28:32.<br/>&gt; While the idea of tuning a gamelan based on just ratios is more an<br/>&gt; aspect of recent international developments than of traditional<br/>&gt; Javanese or Balinese practice, small fourths around 470-490 cents are<br/>&gt; very typical of traditional slendro tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Returning to seven-note scales, I should emphasize that while my<br/>&gt; discussion has focused on a &quot;neomedieval fusion&quot; style combining<br/>&gt; aspects of medieval European and Near Eastern practices, scales<br/>&gt; combining neutral intervals with supra-Pythagorean or Archytan ones<br/>&gt; are by no means limited to this application.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George Secor, in his article focusing on his own 17-tone<br/>&gt; well-temperament, gives a number of scales which can be nicely<br/>&gt; approximated using a 705-cent generator, describing their use for<br/>&gt; example in a kind of &quot;four-part xenharmony&quot; in some ways curiously<br/>&gt; analogous to 18th-19th century European tonality. Since his<br/>&gt; presentation, published in _Xenharmonikon_ 18, is happily available on<br/>&gt; the Web, I will here give a link, followed by some of his scales<br/>&gt; discussed in the article and their generator chains at 705 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    &lt;<a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first scale is very similar to the Ibn Sina/Secor tuning above,<br/>&gt; except that the 7/4 minor seventh at 969 cents is replaced by an 11/6<br/>&gt; neutral seventh at 1049 cents -- or, in our tuning, the 975-cent minor<br/>&gt; seventh Db-A# by a 1050-cent neutral seventh Db=B. Secor&apos;s just ratios<br/>&gt; and their values in cents, which he approximates in the article with<br/>&gt; his 17-note well-temperament or 17-WT for short, are shown above the<br/>&gt; generator chains and interval sizes in our 705-cent tuning:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   1/1    13/12    7/6      4/3     3/2    13/8     11/6      2/1<br/>&gt;    0      139     267      498     702     841     1049      1200<br/>&gt;      139      128      231     204     139     209      151<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [0, 0] [-4, 7] [-8, 14] [1, -1]  [0, 1] [-4, 8]  [-5, 10]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;    Db      D       D#       Gb      Ab      A        B        Db<br/>&gt;    0      135     270      495     705     840     1050      1200<br/>&gt;       135     135      225     210     135     210      150<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly, the 11:6 neutral seventh results at 705 cents from a<br/>&gt; chain of ten generators up -- the same chain which, around 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; meantone (696.58 cents) or 31-tET (696.77 cents), yields a fine<br/>&gt; approximation of a 7:4 minor seventh. See Secor&apos;s article at p. 69 for<br/>&gt; some of the possibilities of this scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A closely related version shown by Secor at p. 71 has a neutral rather<br/>&gt; than minor third:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   1/1    13/12     11/9     4/3     3/2    13/8      11/6      2/1<br/>&gt;    0      139      347      498     702     841      1049      1200<br/>&gt;      139      209      151      204     139      209      151<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [0, 0] [-4, 7]  [-5, 9]  [1, -1]  [0, 1] [-4, 8]  [-5, 10]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;    Db      D        E       Gb       Ab      A        B        Db<br/>&gt;    0      135      345      495     705     840      1050      1200<br/>&gt;       135     210      150      210     135      210      150<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet another of Secor&apos;s variations has an 11:8 superfourth or small<br/>&gt; tritone at 551 cents in place of the perfect fourth in our previous<br/>&gt; scales, an interval here approximated by a chain of 11 generators up<br/>&gt; less six octaves at 555 cents:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   1/1    13/12     11/9     11/8     3/2    13/8      11/6      2/1<br/>&gt;    0      139      347       551     702     841      1049      1200<br/>&gt;      139      209       204      151     139      209      151<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [0, 0] [-4, 7]  [-5, 9]  [-6, 11]  [0, 1] [-4, 8]  [-5, 10]  [1, 0]<br/>&gt;    Db      D        E         F       Ab      A        B        Db<br/>&gt;    0      135      345       495     705     840      1050      1200<br/>&gt;       135     210       210      150     135      210      150<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the examples of part-writing in this presentation have focused<br/>&gt; on chords in three or four voices, typical of a neomedieval style,<br/>&gt; Secor often focuses on more complex structures closely approximating<br/>&gt; partials in the harmonic series. An example which shows off these<br/>&gt; impressively rich and &quot;different&quot; possibilities is the 6:7:9:11:13<br/>&gt; chord, which Secor discusses at page 76 of his article in the setting<br/>&gt; of his 17-WT system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 6:7:9:11:13 chord is an example of what is termed an &quot;isoharmonic&quot;<br/>&gt; chord, where in a JI version there are equal differences between the<br/>&gt; partial numbers of successive notes, as with the upper four notes at<br/>&gt; partials 7-9-11-13, where this difference is 2. In 6-7-9-11-13, we<br/>&gt; might in strict terms speak of a &quot;semi-isoharmonic&quot; chord, since the<br/>&gt; first pair of partials 6-7 have a difference of 1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 705-cent tuning, close approximations of this five-note chord<br/>&gt; or &quot;pentad&quot; are available at 5 of the 19 locations. While all five<br/>&gt; notes sound simultaneously as a chord, I find it easier to write out<br/>&gt; the notes and intervals horizontally in their JI and tempered<br/>&gt; versions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             1/1      7/6      3/2      11/6      13/6<br/>&gt;              0       267      702      1049      1339<br/>&gt;                 7:6       9:7     11:9      13:11<br/>&gt;                 267       435      347       289<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            [0, 0]  [-8,14]   [0, 1]  [-5, 10]  [-3, 7]<br/>&gt;              0       270      705      1050      1335<br/>&gt;                 270       435      345       285<br/>&gt;              Db       D#       Ab        B         D<br/>&gt;              Eb       E#       Bb        C#        E<br/>&gt;              Gb       G#       Db        E         G<br/>&gt;              Ab       A#       Eb        F#        A<br/>&gt;              Cb       C#       Gb        A         C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that our 705-cent tuning is very accurate for these ratios of<br/>&gt; 2-3-7-11-13, but with the complications of some long chains of<br/>&gt; generators (especially for ratios of 7), and intricate note spellings<br/>&gt; and mappings for the keyboardist. In contrast, Secor&apos;s 17-WT<br/>&gt; approximates ratios of 7 not quite so accurately but much more simply<br/>&gt; in the nearer part of the 17-note circle: for example, a regular minor<br/>&gt; third like D-F is quite close to 7:6; a major third like C-E to 9:7,<br/>&gt; and a minor seventh like D-C to 7:4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George Secor&apos;s informative article is highly recommended for an<br/>&gt; understanding both of some of the scales and examples above using the<br/>&gt; 705-cent tuning, and of the versatile 17-WT system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt; 4. Conclusion<br/>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In looking at a slendro tuning at 19-tET and some regular Pythagorean<br/>&gt; and Archytan or 2-3-7 sonorities at 702 cents (Part I), and here a<br/>&gt; range possibilities at 705 cents involving partials 2-3-7-11-13, my<br/>&gt; purpose has been to present some material which might enrich the<br/>&gt; Thummer/Matrix paradigm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Desiring to focus above all on musical possibilities rather than fine<br/>&gt; points of theory, I would conclude with an open question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To what degree can some of the generator chains and musical<br/>&gt; applications shown above be helpfully assisted with special<br/>&gt; temperament mappings -- e.g. for neutral thirds or ratios of 2-3-7 at<br/>&gt; 705 cents -- and to what degree does the intricate mixture of<br/>&gt; intervals likely to be needed suggest that the keyboardist is still<br/>&gt; often the best person to sort out the artistic possibilities &quot;on the<br/>&gt; fly&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Experience may be the obvious basis for resulving such questions. I<br/>&gt; wonder what George Secor, a premier user and advocate of the<br/>&gt; generalized keyboard, might say about these issues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=78259 href="#78259">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2008 2:40:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Please forgive me for posting this quickly without adequate proofing;<br/>I wanted to share my excitement at the result of the 6/3 comma<br/>division for usual apotome and limma suggested as one possible reading<br/>by Dave Keenan, coupled with a 7/2 division for chroma and diesis, as<br/>developed in what follows.]</p><p>Hello, Dave, and thank you for an outstanding response which, as I&apos;ll<br/>acknowledge in more detali below, has lots of very perceptive<br/>questions and musically telling points. Really, reading your remarks<br/>was one of the high points of my week so far.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; Exactly how much smaller or larger, as George Secor and I and<br/>  &gt;&gt; many others have asked, is the more problematic question. Since<br/>  &gt;&gt; we&apos;re dealing with voices, by nature variable, it might be a moot<br/>  &gt;&gt; question.</p><p>  &gt;  But we can have a lot of fun trying to figure out how large<br/>  &gt; Marchetto was trying to tell us it should be. It seems he had<br/>  &gt; theorised something fairly specific, even if he wasn&apos;t very good<br/>  &gt; at explaining it in terms that could be understood hundreds of<br/>  &gt; years later.</p><p>Indeed! As someone myself addicted to this pastime, I know it&apos;s a<br/>fascinating mixture of historical grounding and creative<br/>interpretations to fit with one&apos;s own tuning practices or taste -- at<br/>least for those of us who get involved in the medieval/neomedieval<br/>arena. Your points lend a healthy balance on this last point.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Note that while Marchettus seems to take Pythagorean intonation as<br/>&gt;&gt; the basis for his system, this important modification moves in the<br/>&gt;&gt; opposite direction from the 5-limit tendencies ...</p><p>&gt; Agreed.</p><p>For the sake of others who may be reading this, I might just add an<br/>amusing demonstration of the complications that might result from a<br/>5-limit interpretation of what might be considered quite unfortunate<br/>language from a 20th-century perspective in calling the apotome the<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; semitone. I tend to think that Marchetto mixed concepts or<br/>language in a curious way, and happened to arrive at a term that would<br/>serve ideally to mislead people in search of &quot;5-limit&quot; readings in<br/>early music. As you well observe, Ptolemy and others have lots of<br/>diatonics: why not, as I recall you commented elsewhere, 12:11 as in<br/>the Equable or Even Diatonic, if we take this line of reasoning?</p><p>What I would rely on is the logic of Marchetto&apos;s notation and<br/>examples, and the style of early 14th-century Italian music (including<br/>the pieces he is known or suspected to have composed). This isn&apos;t the<br/>English musical dialect of _Sumer is icumen in_, where a 5-limit<br/>reading would be stylistically persuasive even if we didn&apos;t have<br/>Theinred of Dover and Walter Odington telling us how close the<br/>theoretical ratios for thirds are to a simple 5:4 and 6:5. It isn&apos;t<br/>the early 15th century as reflected by the Faenza Codex from Italy or<br/>the style of the young Dufay or the older layers of the Buxheim Organ<br/>Book, where &quot;schismatic&quot; thirds from sharps tuned as Pythagorean flats<br/>are implied by the style and documented by some remarks and debates in<br/>the literature (including Prosdocimus and Ugolino, who appear to<br/>advocate a 17-note tuning in order to preserve rather than to alter<br/>the regular sizes of thirds -- a sign that others _are_ altering them<br/>in a way that leads to meantone temperaments by around mid-century).</p><p>For my quick demonstration to confirm our agreed point, I&apos;d invite<br/>people to consider this two-voice progression of Marchetto:</p><p>        C        C#        D<br/>        F        E         D</p><p>Here we have a 3:2 fifth followed by a cadential major sixth resolving<br/>to a 2:1 octave, to that the total expansion or motion in both voices<br/>should add up to 4:3, or 498 cents. Further, Marchettus defines a tone<br/>as 9:8, and doesn&apos;t discuss using two sizes of tones. So taking the<br/>ratios which he gives of 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8 as a basis, we have:</p><p>       C   ?   C#   ?    D<br/>       F   ?   E  -204   D</p><p>As it happens, there&apos;s no apotome in this progression -- it would<br/>occur in Bb - B, for example. However, the other three sizes are in<br/>evidence: the &quot;usual&quot; F-E in the lowest part preceding the 9/8 tone;<br/>the chroma C-C#; and the diesis C#-D.</p><p>According to Marchettus, it would seem that C-D should, like E-D, be a<br/>9:8 tone. Suppose we accept a division something like what you have<br/>proposed, around 7-2 commas, or 158-46 cents. Thus:</p><p>       C  +158  C#  +46   D<br/>       F   ?    E  -204   D</p><p>Then F-E should be 90 cents, a Pythagorean limma or about 4 commas.</p><p>       C  +158  C#  +46   D<br/>       F   -90  E  -204   D</p><p>Of course, as you point it, that usual or &quot;enharmonic&quot; semitone could<br/>actually be smaller, which might mean that singers would produce usual<br/>minor thirds rather smaller than 32:27 or 294 cents. Other world<br/>traditions where semitones a bit smaller than 90 cents, where tuning<br/>seems based on &quot;essentially pure&quot; fifths and fourths, provide a very<br/>credible precedent.</p><p>However, if Marchettus really means that the apotome is the &quot;usual&quot;<br/>semitone, that would raise some complications. Specifically,<br/>Marchettus indicates that Bb-B is an apotome, the usual understanding,<br/>so that the &quot;mi-sign&quot; as I&apos;ll call it (like a natural or &quot;square-B&quot;<br/>sign) alters by an apotome, as does the flat or &quot;fa-sign.&quot; This<br/>implies that call it the &quot;diatonic&quot; semitone although he does, it&apos;s<br/>not the usual or regular semitone step like A-Bb or E-F (routine<br/>mi-fa).</p><p>If it were, we might expect either more intricate accidentals to show<br/>alterations of a limma, or signs showing tones reduced by a comma (as<br/>happen in medieval Near Eastern and modern Turkish music, for<br/>example). Marchettus, indeed, refers to thirds and sixths as<br/>&quot;tolerable dissonances&quot; -- in contrast to Odington&apos;s remarks that<br/>singers produce them so that they are &quot;fully concordant.&quot;</p><p>Suppose that the &quot;diatonic semitone&quot; of &quot;three parts&quot; means that this<br/>is the usual step at E-F, B-C, A-Bb, etc. Then we might have:</p><p>       C  +150   C#  +30   D<br/>       F  -114   E  -204   D</p><p>Here I have made the chroma C-C# equal to only 150 cents rather than<br/>158 or 159 cents. Note that if E-F is really 114 cents, then the lower<br/>voice&apos;s descent of F-D is in all 32768:19683 or 318 cents, which plus<br/>the 150-cent chroma (around 12:11, my arbitrary value, not any<br/>specification of Marchetto!) is 468 cents, leaving only 30 cents for<br/>the diesis!</p><p>Anyway, I need to check some sources and confirm, if possible, that<br/>the limma is indeed the &quot;enharmonic semitone&quot; -- a curious wording,<br/>since I&apos;d associate the enharmonic genus with some kind of ditone plus<br/>two dieses, although at least one of them might be a large as a small<br/>semitone which could be used in the other genera also.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;ve only seen where he refers to an &quot;enharmonic&quot; semitone as being<br/>&gt;  &quot;two parts&quot; of a tone (out of his 5 unequal parts). Does he<br/>&gt;  actually refer to it as a &quot;regular semitone&quot; in any sense? Does he<br/>&gt;  actually refer to it as a limma, or as 256:243?</p><p>I&apos;ll need to check my sources: but I definitely recall that he<br/>identifies the &quot;two parts&quot; as the usual limma; and I stated this in a<br/>paper that I wrote in 2001 and linked to my previous post, so let&apos;s<br/>hope I&apos;m right &lt;grin&gt;. The apotome and limma stand out very clearly to<br/>me, and also to people like Jan Herlinger who notes that in the<br/>Renaissance, people attracted to Marchetto changed the definition so<br/>that the major semitone would be the regular one, fitting meantone (or<br/>5-limit JI).</p><p>You have an important point that equating the limma or usual semitone<br/>with &quot;two parts&quot; -- or more generally the _minor_ semitone -- doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily imply 256:243. That I should  check also.</p><p>[Going back to the Latin text used for Jan Herlinger&apos;s translation, I<br/>see that Marchetto indeed repeatedly makes it clear that the<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; semitone is the usual one, and identifies it with Plato&apos;s<br/>_lima_, but evidently not with 256:243. He does make it clear that it<br/>is less than half of a tone, but invokes 18:17 as its ratio --<br/>unlikely to be a practical value, as we agree.]</p><p>&gt;  I still see no way to decide between about 68 cents and about 90 cents<br/>&gt;  for his &quot;enharmonic&quot; semitone. As explained in my previous post<br/>&gt;  responding to Monz.</p><p>The 68-cent hypothesis is fun! That&apos;s about absolutely optimal by<br/>George Secor&apos;s standards, and with a 9:8 tone would yield a regular<br/>minor third very close to 7:6! We&apos;d get a usual major third around 430<br/>cents -- not taking into account questions of whether or how the 9:8<br/>tone might get affected in size, etc. -- this is flexible vocal<br/>intonation rather than a regular temperament, so I guess it could get<br/>quite involved.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; but that in these<br/>  &gt;&gt; progressions, an especially small interval called a &quot;diesis&quot; is used<br/>  &gt;&gt; including only &quot;one&quot; of the five parts of a tone.</p><p>&gt; I find it most likely that this diesis is in th erange 43 to 48 cents,<br/>&gt; not the comma-sized &quot;diesis&quot;, and not an equal 5-part division of the<br/>&gt; tone (40 cents).</p><p>Yes, if we follow the &quot;one part&quot; in the most natural reading, as<br/>opposed to devising clever interpretations to obtain a larger size (a<br/>game I&apos;ve played), I&apos;d agree that 43-48 cents is a logical<br/>estimate. Something like 1/31 octave or 128:125 seems a bit small --<br/>fine for Vicentino in a 16th-century meantone setting, where as far as<br/>I know the step is used as a &quot;sliding&quot; of the voice rather than a<br/>directed cadential &quot;semitone&quot; or surrogate.</p><p>   &gt;&gt; If these &quot;parts&quot; are approximately equal, as _some_ of his theory<br/>   &gt;&gt; might fairly suggest,</p><p>   &gt; How is that suggested? What would be the point of first dividing<br/>   &gt; the tone into 9 (or 8) if the aim was an approximately equal<br/>   &gt; 5-fold division?</p><p>Actually &quot;suggested&quot; might be well modified to &quot;inferred by some<br/>readers,&quot; as your just query duly alerts us! Prosdocimus did infer<br/>this and take Marchetto to task for proposing that a superparticular<br/>ratio like 9:8 be divided into five or any number of &quot;equal&quot; parts --<br/>possibly showing mainly how he can be misinterpreted in an authentic<br/>early 15th-century manner, for those who care to follow this tradition<br/>&lt;grin&gt;. The &quot;six dieses&quot; of distance between a cadential major sixth<br/>and either an octave or a fifth might play into the hand of someone<br/>who wants to find a 14th-century version of 29-EDO -- but only because<br/>that hand could be overly eager to grasp at any EDO paradigm.</p><p>The point about the 9-fold division is also exactly to the<br/>issue. Somewhat more than a century later, Ugolino isn&apos;t shy about how<br/>to divide a limma into two near-equal dieses for the sake of<br/>completeness, thus making his 17-note keyboard tuning a 19-note tuning<br/>to accommodate the manner of the ancients as he describes it: just do<br/>an arithmetic division of 256:243, i.e. 512:499:486, at E-F and B-C.</p><p>&gt;  I can see that his enharmonic and diatonic may be 4 and 5 commas<br/>&gt;  respectively. They could also be 3 and 6 commas respectively.</p><p>The 3/6 hypothesis for the limma and apotome is really fascinating;<br/>the corresponding regular tuning would be 17-EDO, but of course this<br/>is flexible vocal intonation. Here 17-EDO or George&apos;s 17=WT is of<br/>interest mainly in showing how pleasant this kind of arrangement might<br/>be for lots of 14th-century music.</p><p>&gt; But I do<br/>&gt; not agree that his chromatic semitone could be as small as 6 commas.</p><p>&gt;  Doesn&apos;t he clearly state that his chromatic semitone corresponds to 4<br/>&gt;  of his dieses, and that there are 5 of his dieses in a whole-tone.</p><p>Yes, precisely.</p><p>&gt;  You would need to group the 9 commas _very_ unevenly into 5 &quot;dieses&quot;,<br/>&gt;  to make 4 dieses encompass 6 commas. You would need to have 3 dieses<br/>&gt;  of a single comma, and two dieses of 3 commas, within the tone.</p><p>True, and I admit that this is the kind of kludge that I&apos;ve posted<br/>here -- but it&apos;s quite distinct from the simplest and most elegant<br/>reading of the text, which is what you have summed up.</p><p>&gt;  I think it&apos;s fairly clear that he groups the commas as 1, 2, 2, 2, 2.<br/>&gt;  At least I see no suggestion of 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 or 3, 1, 1, 1, 3. Nor do<br/>&gt;  I accept Jay Rahn&apos;s argument for 2, 2, 1, 2, 2.</p><p>Rahn at least has the sizes right. Maybe he and I somehow like the<br/>idea of the &quot;four diaschismata plus a comma&quot; (Boethius, not Marchetto)<br/>with the single comma in the middle, a kind of symmetry. However, I<br/>agree that Marchetto&apos;s emphasis on using odd numbers would very much<br/>fit a sequence of 1-3-5-7-9 commas, your 1-2-2-2-2, or a division of<br/>81:80:78:76:74:72. The main hazard of this natural reading in the<br/>tuning community is that the opening 81:80 could be taken as another<br/>cue to infer a 5-limit orientation where it&apos;s unlikely to apply.</p><p>Yes, a theorist such as Jacobus of Liege in this same epoch of<br/>European music is fully aware of the 81:80 and 64:63 commas in<br/>discussing the theoretical possibility of using ratios such as 5:1,<br/>5:4, 7:1, and 7:6, finding them likely somewhat concordant but<br/>impractical in the prevailing tuning system, rather like more recent<br/>theorists dismissing the seventh partial because it is impractical in<br/>12-EDO. However, I would regard 81:80 in Marchetto&apos;s division as<br/>simply a coincidence; this is on the basis of considering his<br/>presentation in full context, and also the style he is addressing.</p><p>&gt;  So I find that his chromatic semitone is most likely to be 7 commas<br/>&gt;  (around 159 cents) and the remaining diesis 2 commas (around 45 cents).</p><p>That&apos;s a very fair conclusion.</p><p>[On the possible reading of an 8:7:6 division of the fourth to define<br/>the cadential major sixth as &quot;equally distant&quot; from 3:2 or 2:1, and<br/>thus at 12:7 on a monochord]</p><p>&gt; Yes. I agree that&apos;s a possible reading.</p><p>However, I must confirm that indeed the 7-2 comma reading of the &quot;five<br/>parts&quot; as divided between chroma and diesis is the obvious one, as you<br/>have demonstrated, and that that would also produce a cadential major<br/>sixth about &quot;midway between&quot; fifth and octave (more in a geometric<br/>way).</p><p>&gt;&gt; When Marchettus says that the cadential major sixth differs by &quot;six<br/>&gt;&gt; dieses&quot; from either a fifth or an octave, that suggests comparably<br/>&gt;&gt; sized units.</p><p>&gt;  Yes it does.</p><p>Or, to be fair on my part, &quot;It _could_ suggest equal dieses.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; If so, then some expansion of the usual Pythagorean major<br/>&gt;&gt; third and sixth by something rather more than a comma -- closer to two<br/>&gt;&gt; commas -- seems indicated.</p><p>&gt;  Why not exactly two commas?</p><p>I agree -- why not indeed? As Jan Herlinger and Geoerge Secor have<br/>pointed out, one consequence is a cadential major sixth about halfway<br/>between a Pythagorean major sixth and minor seventh (906 and 996<br/>cents), with Herlinger simply finding this unlikely and Secor<br/>observing that &quot;ambiguity&quot; in the categorization of such an interval<br/>might result. However, that doesn&apos;t mean it might not happen; and I<br/>find it both practical and thrilling, even if leaning often toward a<br/>7-based reading (not stated by Marchettus, I&apos;d emphasize).</p><p>[On a 2-2-1-2-2 scheme]</p><p>&gt;  This is all well and good, except that I believe Marchetto puts the<br/>&gt;  single-comma &quot;diesis&quot; at one end, not in the middle, based on that<br/>&gt;  passage that Monz and I have been discussing.</p><p>Yes, and the emphasis on odd numbers supports your reading also, as I<br/>seem to recall you may have pointed out in that discussion.</p><p>&gt;  That doesn&apos;t invalidate the sizes suggested here (within +-3 cents)<br/>&gt;  but it does upen up the possibility of the enharmonic being 3 commas<br/>&gt;  and the diatonic being 6.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m just now catching the connection between this proposal and<br/>the fivefold/nine-comma division. If we take the &quot;first part&quot; or 1,<br/>and the second or 1-3, as the &quot;two parts&quot; of the limma, we indeed get<br/>three commas -- leaving six for the apotome. This is really exciting,<br/>both refreshingly different _and_ a perfectly reasonable reading of<br/>the division, however we tie it in with other clues.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The main problem with this admirably elegant solution is that it<br/>&gt;&gt; requires greatly unequal dieses --</p><p>&gt; But Marchettos _says_ they are unequal. Doesn&apos;t he?</p><p>True, if one reads the 1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9 passage naturally --<br/>rather than assuming that some EDO is involved, or the geometrically<br/>equal division that Prosdocimus assumes and refutes.</p><p>&gt;&gt; in contrast to the description of a cadential major sixth as &quot;six<br/>&gt;&gt; dieses&quot; from either a fifth or an octave, which might imply a more<br/>&gt;&gt; even unit of measurement. However, the &quot;six dieses&quot; observation<br/>&gt;&gt; would remain valid under this solution if we reasonably take &quot;six<br/>&gt;&gt; dieses&quot; to mean &quot;a regular 9:8 tone or five dieses, plus a sixth<br/>&gt;&gt; diesis equal to a diaschisma or demi-limma -- in other words,<br/>&gt;&gt; roughly 11 commas.&quot; Since a fourth consists of about 22 commas, and<br/>&gt;&gt; marks the distance from a 3:2 fifth to a 2:1 octave, the cadential<br/>&gt;&gt; major sixth at about 11 commas from either (say about 951 cents, or<br/>&gt;&gt; 26:15 or 64:37 in JI/RI terms) would nicely fulfill this<br/>&gt;&gt; description.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Aha! Yes. Well done. Does this agree with my chromatic semitone of 7<br/>&gt;&gt; commas (about 159 cents) and its remnant of a 2-comma diesis (about 45<br/>&gt;&gt; cents)?</p><p>Let&apos;s try it. For simplicity or &quot;starting from the familiar,&quot; I&apos;ll<br/>assume for the moment that in a two-voice cadence, the lower voice<br/>descends by a 9:8 tone, and that the upper voice ascends by about 45<br/>cents. We&apos;re expanding from some kind of wide major sixth to 2:1 or<br/>1200 cents, the the sixth must be 1200 less 204 less 45 or 951 cents.<br/>Going back to our formula cited above given by Marchetto:</p><p>           C    159    C#    45    D<br/>           F     90    E    204    D</p><p>         702          951        1200</p><p>I wonder how this might be modified with the 6/3 comma division for<br/>apotome and limma, or roughly 136/68 cents. If we assume Marchetto&apos;s<br/>ratios of 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8, there might be contradictions; I<br/>tend to get something like this to avoid them:</p><p>Just for fun, let&apos;s assume that the 6/3 division of apotome/limma<br/>applies rather a 5/4 division as above. The apotome isn&apos;t in evidence<br/>here, but the limma is (F-E), so we have (taking your 68 cents):</p><p>           C    159    C#    45    D<br/>           F     68    E    226    D</p><p>          702         929        1200</p><p>My logic would be like this. If we agree that the upper voice ascends<br/>with its two steps of 7/2 commas by a 9:8 tone in all, then to move<br/>from a pure fifth to a pure octave the other voice must contribute<br/>another 32:27 or 294 cents of motion in the opposite or descending<br/>direction. If its first step is 68 cents, our 3-comma limma, this<br/>means a larger tone of 226 cents -- essentially identical to the<br/>extended Pythagoren steps of 227 cents and 67 cents, the first equal<br/>to two apotomes (the _tonus maior_ of Jacobus of Liege around 1325),<br/>and the second to the classic 256:243 limma less a comma.</p><p>The interesting result is that our cadential major sixth is now 929<br/>cents -- a 12:7 less the septimal schisma, essentially. I didn&apos;t<br/>anticipate this curious side-effect of the 6/3 division, coupled to<br/>7/2 for chroma/diesis: the cadential major sixth is in the 12:7<br/>neighborhood, rather than around 951 cents.</p><p>In essence this is 2-3-7 JI, as in Archytas or Ptolemy&apos;s Tonic<br/>Diatonic, with tones at either 9:8 or 8:7 (putting aside the septimal<br/>schisma of ~3.80 cents), and likewise a limma of 28:27. It&apos;s curious<br/>that while we agree that a &quot;7-based&quot; reading is mostly in the eyes of<br/>a creative beholder and interpreter, your hypothesis seems to bring<br/>much the same result. I&apos;d emphasize, of course, that you raised 6-3<br/>commas simply as a possible reading, not necessarily as the intended<br/>one.</p><p>By the way, in a different kind of system, we get a rather similar<br/>result in Zest-24 at one location, albeit with a yet wider &quot;chroma&quot; at<br/>a bit larger than 54:49 or 168 cents:</p><p>          Db   171   D*   46   Eb<br/>          Gb    70   F   217   Eb</p><p>         696        937       1200</p><p>While the major sixth F-D* is slightly larger than 12:7, it&apos;s still in<br/>that general vicinity -- although elsewhere there are intervals of 946<br/>and 950 cents illustrating the size often read in Marchetto, if one<br/>assumes a 5/4 apotome/limma division plus a 7/2 chroma/diesis<br/>division.</p><p>   &gt;&gt; The 18:17:16 division mentioned by Marchettus seems a curious<br/>   &gt;&gt; digression when taken in the context of the musical as well<br/>   &gt;&gt; mathematical setting sketched out by Marchettus. This division is<br/>   &gt;&gt; advocated as a practical and desirable one by the author Quintillian<br/>   &gt;&gt; in classic Rome. Boethius seems to describe it more as an example of<br/>   &gt;&gt; how it is impossible to divide a superparticular ratio such as 9:8<br/>   &gt;&gt; into two equal (and rational, one might add) ratios, than as an actual<br/>   &gt;&gt; standard by which the tone should be divided.</p><p>   &gt; Thanks for that. I&apos;m currently thinking of it as an example, from<br/>   &gt; Marchetto, of what not to do.</p><p>Yes, or maybe a curious digression mentioning a division cited in<br/>Boethius as an academic exercise. An English organ treatise of 1373<br/>does recommend this division for organ pipes: to find the length of a<br/>pipe for adding an accidental semitone (maybe other than Bb, a part of<br/>the regular gamut which may have been calculated as part of the<br/>regular chain of fifths down from F), take the average of the two<br/>pipes forming the tone you wish to divide, thus C-C#-D at 18:17:16.</p><p>This might have the advantage both of being easy to calculate, and of<br/>producing notably milder tunings for common major thirds like A-C# at<br/>around 393 cents (294 + 99, or A-C-C#), although it leads to two<br/>notably impure fifths rather than one Wolf in a 12-note tuning. Mark<br/>Lindley discusses this, as well as the use of a regular 12-note chain<br/>of fifths at Gb-B in early 15th-century Europe that does result in<br/>some schismatic thirds involving sharps of the kind that Ozan has<br/>discussed in Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and in a maqam like modern Turkish<br/>Rast -- e.g. A-C# tuned A-Db at 8192:6561 or 384 cents on an early<br/>15th-century European keyboard.</p><p>Anyway, getting back to Marchetto and similar styles, I should mention<br/>that I&apos;ve been re-exploring a regular temperament that I was very<br/>excited about in the year 2000, and seems to me to fill a special<br/>niche not irrelevant to this general discussion, although, of course,<br/>distinct from Marchetto&apos;s own intended vocal tuning.</p><p>This regular 24-note tuning is based on a fifth of 704.61 cents, about<br/>the mildest temperament of the fifth that can yield fairly close<br/>7-based ratios from a chain of 13, 14, 15, or 16 _regular_ fifths for<br/>9:7, 7:6, 7:4, and 21:16 respectively (here 440, 264, 969, and 473<br/>cents or so). We have 7:4 and also 11:8 virtually just. albeit with<br/>9:7 not so accurate, at about 5 cents wide (a very mild &quot;Marchettan&quot;<br/>touch? &lt;grin&gt;).</p><p>Playing this, I&apos;m tempted to describe it as about the heaviest<br/>tempering of the fifth I&apos;d be comfortable using in something meant to<br/>be &quot;not too far&quot; from Pythagorean -- I recall your suggestion that<br/>something like 2.7 cents might define a &quot;near-just&quot; range for the<br/>fifth, and here it&apos;s 2.65 cents wide or so.</p><p>Anyway, we have some interesting step sizes:</p><p>                Tone:     209 cents<br/>                Apotome:  132 cents<br/>                Limma:     77 cents<br/>                Chroma:   154 cents<br/>                Diesis:    55 cents</p><p>I really, really, like this. It&apos;s not as faithful to superparticular<br/>ratios like 11:12:13:14 for neutral seconds as Peppermint 24 is, not<br/>to mention the heavier tempering of the regular fifths (2.65 rather<br/>than 2.14 cents); the main advantage is having 23 regular fifths<br/>(G#-D# gets stretched to around 714 cents in Peppermint), and the<br/>simplicity of a single chain. It may be a bit simple having only two<br/>sizes of neutral seconds, for example, but I find it one pleasant<br/>place on the continuum.</p><p>Here we get a tempered version of Marchetto&apos;s progression as follows:</p><p>           C*   154    D     55    D<br/>           F*    77    E*   209    D</p><p>          705         936        1200</p><p>Anyway, I like this -- while recognizing that it might actually rather<br/>more &quot;conservative&quot; in its degree of chroma/limma contrast than the<br/>7/2 division quite naturally read in Marchetto, as you have shown.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=78264 href="#78264">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2008 10:27:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Margo, the Yarman24 rendition of maqam Segah would be:<br/>&gt;  0: 1/1 0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>&gt;  1: 16/15 111.731 minor diatonic semitone<br/>&gt;  2: 6/5 315.641 minor third<br/>&gt;  3: 501.956 cents 501.956<br/>&gt;  4: 3/2 701.955 perfect fifth<br/>&gt;  5: 8/5 813.686 minor sixth<br/>&gt;  6: 9/5 1017.596 just minor seventh, BP seventh<br/>&gt;  7: 1105.866 cents 1105.866<br/>&gt;  8: 2/1 1200.000 octave</p><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Please let me say what a pleasure it is to be discussing the maqamat<br/>or makamlar with you: as always, both educational and enlightening.<br/>Is there a movement afoot to revive the learning of the Mutazilah Era?</p><p>&gt;  Bear in mind that the 0th step is perde segah, which is 5/4 of Yarman24:</p><p>This is a very interesting point, because the procedure for finding<br/>Maqam Segah or Sikah is the same for Arab as for Turkish flavors, at<br/>least for the most part, but with somewhat different results.

Why don&apos;t I include your listing at the end of this post for<br/>people who might find it convenient, along with a Scala file.</p><p>The interesting thing I notice is that in this flavor of Segah, perde<br/>segah and perde huseyni form a fourth close to a just 4:3. Thinking of<br/>these as the third and sixth steps of Maqam Rast in a mostly 5-limit<br/>flavor, I realize that segah might incline toward 5/4 and huseyni<br/>toward 27/16 above rast -- but here with enough &quot;tempering&quot; so that<br/>the fourth remains near 4:3. In the 79-MOS, for example on a qanun, I<br/>would guess that you might use the wide or meantone fourth at about<br/>505 cents, thus something like 392-898 cents for these perdeler --<br/>indeed, I am hardly guessing, just reading and checking your papers!</p><p>In the tuning I&apos;m now exploring, a regular 24-note system (much less<br/>clever than Yarman24) with fifths at 704.607 cents, Segah is formed a<br/>bit differently, as also in at least some Arab traditions where Rast<br/>has a tuning more like that of al-Farabi&apos;s version of Zalzal&apos;s scale<br/>for the &grave;ud or lute. Here segah might be somewhere around 27/22 above<br/>rast. In this tuning, placing perde rast for the moment at B, we have:</p><p>                      Maqam Rast</p><p>           Rast          9:8        Rast<br/>     |-----------------|.....|-------------------|<br/>   Rast Dugah Segah Chargah Neva Huseyni Evdj Gerdaniye<br/>     B    C#    Eb     E     F#    G#     Bb     B<br/>     0    209   363   495   705    914   1068  1200<br/>       209   154   132   209   209    154   132</p><p>Interestingly, some of the intervals aren&apos;t so far from flavors found<br/>in Ozan24, such as 363 cents (a large 16/13 or small 100/81 or 121/98)<br/>and 1068 cents (not too narrow of 13/7); I might call this a submajor<br/>flavor of Rast, with evdj (Arabic awj) at 1068 cents notably wider<br/>than 81/44 (1057 cents) in al-Farabi&apos;s version of Zalzal&apos;s tuning.</p><p>When we take the same perdeler, one flavor of what is often known in<br/>Arab theory as the &quot;fundamental scale&quot; based on perde rast, with the<br/>1/1 on perde segah (or in Arabic, sikah), we get this very interesting<br/>result, with a curious intonational twist in this tuning:</p><p>                 Maqam Segah (or Sikah)</p><p>              Rast         9:8             Rast<br/>     |-------------------|......|-------------------------|<br/>  Segah  Chargah Neva Huseyni Evdj Gerdaniye  Muhayyer Tik Segah<br/>     Eb     E     F#     G#     Bb      B       C#        Eb<br/>     0     132   342    551    705     837     1046      1200<br/>       132    210   209    154     132     209       154</p><p>In this version of Segah, the neutral third of Rast at perde segah and<br/>the major sixth at perde huseyni form a small tritone or<br/>&quot;superfourth,&quot; as Dave Keenan has well named it, which in this tuning<br/>is at a virtually just 11/8, formed by the augmented third Eb-G#. This<br/>is the one location in the tuning where a perfect fourth is not<br/>available -- but the augmented third is just what we want for this<br/>flavor of Segah, and makes it possible to play these basic notes of<br/>the maqam on a single keyboard, although obviously inflections or<br/>modulations will draw on more notes.</p><p>The sweet polyphonic flavors of this version include a most charming<br/>final cadence:</p><p>            C#    Eb<br/>            G#    Bb<br/>            E     Eb</p><p>The major third and sixth of E-G#-C# at 0-418-914 cents resolve to the<br/>fifth and octave, with the lowest voice descending by 132 cents and<br/>the upper ones ascending by 154 cents. This is deliciously a &quot;middle<br/>second&quot; flavor, what George Secor has termed an equable cadence.</p><p>Anyway, looking at some of your tunings, I noted the feature that two<br/>different flavors of neutral intervals such as thirds and sixths may<br/>be available above a single perde or step such as rast, as happens<br/>delightfully with middle thirds and sevenths in Ozan24, and of course<br/>with many shadings in 79-MOS.

Two more steps are<br/>added so that we can have two pairs of tritones: the middle ones<br/>closer to 600 cents fitting the regular chain of fifths, and the<br/>smallest and largest at a virtually just 11/8 and 16/11. Thus we have<br/>six additional perdeler or steps in all, and 17 plus 6 or 23 notes.</p><p>The special property of this system is that the notes and intervals<br/>have a &quot;mirror&quot; pattern on the two sides of the &quot;axis&quot; at 600 cents,<br/>not itself represented by a note. If we count 1/1 and 2/1 as distinct<br/>steps, then we have 24 steps in all within and including an octave:<br/>and these form 12 pairs, each adding up to 1200 cents: thus</p><p>               1/1 (0)       2/1 (1200)<br/>                   77             1123<br/>                  132             1067<br/>                  154             1046<br/>                  ....            ....<br/>                  572              628</p><p>This degree of temperament is quite close to the 705-cent system we<br/>have discussed, or 63-EDO which is very similar, as you observed. A<br/>compromise of this slightly milder tempering of the fifth is that<br/>11/9, 13/8, 11/6, and especially 9/7 will be less accurate. A possible<br/>benefit is that we have virtually just versions of 7/4, 11/8, and also<br/>23/16 (the regular tritone), a ratio mentioned in your 79-MOS<br/>presentations. An open question is whether 132 cents or 68/63 is low<br/>enough for a dik kurdi (as in Yarnan24) and yet high enough for a very<br/>low segah in Maqam Huseyni or Ushshaq (or some related flavors).</p><p>Of course, as should be made plain, the full 24-note tuning is meant<br/>to be used where ratios of 2-3-7-11-13 are desired, but does not<br/>really represent ratios of 5, although a few odd meantone-size<br/>intervals are present involving very long chains of fifths. Thus it<br/>offers some, but not all, maqam flavors.</p><p>! eb24.scl<br/>!<br/>Regular &quot;e-based&quot; tuning, Blackwood&apos;s R or tone/limma at e, ~2.71828<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 55.28289<br/> 132.24835<br/> 187.53125<br/> 209.21382<br/> 264.49671<br/> 286.17928<br/> 341.46217<br/> 418.42763<br/> 473.71052<br/> 495.39309<br/> 550.67598<br/> 627.64145<br/> 682.92434<br/> 704.60691<br/> 759.88980<br/> 836.85526<br/> 892.13815<br/> 913.82072<br/> 969.10362<br/> 990.78618<br/> 1046.06908<br/> 1123.03454<br/> 1178.31743<br/> 2/1</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=78280 href="#78280">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2008 5:39:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Please forgive me for posting this quickly without adequate proofing;<br/>&gt; I wanted to share my excitement at the result of the 6/3 comma<br/>&gt; division for usual apotome and limma suggested as one possible reading<br/>&gt; by Dave Keenan, coupled with a 7/2 division for chroma and diesis, as<br/>&gt; developed in what follows.]</p><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>As I&apos;m sure everyone on this list would agree, a post from _you_<br/>&quot;without adequate proofing&quot; contains fewer errors than the rest of us<br/>put together.

That&apos;s another discussion, and I&apos;ll resist the<br/>tendency to wander.</p><p>&gt;  I tend to think that Marchetto&apos;s cadential 3rd and 6th are likely<br/>&gt;  to be Merciful rather than Just, for maximum contrast.

Indeed, maybe MI might stand not only for<br/>Merciful Intonation or Metastable Intonation, but also Marchettan<br/>Intonation, with a fair historical basis.</p><p>Of course, what singers might do in practice is an open question: for<br/>some, a tuning like 7:9:12 for E-G#-C# before D-A-D might be &quot;active<br/>enough&quot; -- but full MI is certainly a fair guess. Now comes the fun<br/>part.</p><p>First, while 422 and 923 cents would be quite reasonable -- and I can<br/>easily singers making such adjustments, only about half a septimal or<br/>64:63 comma, or 7/12 Pythagorean comma (say 14-15 cents) -- I suspect<br/>we&apos;ll agree that the division of Marchetto fits better with 448/943.</p><p>Now starting with the 943-cent major sixth, let&apos;s consider this<br/>example of his illustrating the division of tone into chroma and<br/>diesis, assuming Pythagorean intonation in the lower voice:</p><p>               +151               +53<br/>          C ------------- C# -------------- D<br/>         702             943               1200<br/>          F ------------- E  -------------- D<br/>                -90              -204</p><p>Curiously, we have what amounts to a virtually precise division of the<br/>9:8 tone in the upper voice into steps at 12:11 (151 cents) and 33:32<br/>(53 cents)! I would hasten to add that seems a coincidence, rather<br/>than an attempt to emulate Zalzal and al-Farabi, since Marchetto does<br/>not elsewhere discuss neutral intervals (other than the chroma itself,<br/>which he does not to my knowledge categorize as a &quot;neutral&quot; or middle<br/>interval).</p><p>How about the 448-cent major third? Let&apos;s take another, and rather<br/>analogour, Marchettan progression where a unison expands to a<br/>fifth. again assuming regular Pythagorean sizes for steps in the lower<br/>voice, here a minor third at 32:27 or 294 cents followed by a 9:8 tone<br/>at 204 cents:</p><p>                    +154               +50<br/>             G -------------- G# --------------- A<br/>             0               448                702<br/>             G -------------- E  --------------- D<br/>                    -294              -204</p><p>Here the chroma is very slightly wide at 154 cents, and the diesis<br/>slightly narrow at 50 cents -- but not too far from our previous<br/>results with the 943-cent major sixth. An interesting nuance is that<br/>the dieses are a bit wider than the monochord readings of the<br/>&quot;ninefold division into five parts&quot; might suggest. Personally I very<br/>much like small semitones around 50-60 cents, which could also be<br/>described as quartertones -- but again, medieval or modern<br/>interpreters of Marchetto need not be bound by my tastes &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Also, if one happens to be seeking a regular temperament that has both<br/>regular semitones and special steps to realize these &quot;Merciful&quot; or MI<br/>progressions, one candidate was, curiously, announced on this list<br/>eight years ago early next month, and let to lots of responses from<br/>both of us.</p><p>If a generator of 704.096 cents is chosen, then we get these values<br/>which can all be made available at a reasonable number of positions in<br/>a tuning of 24 or more notes per octave:</p><p>                tone:    208.19<br/>                limma:    79.52<br/>                apotome: 128.67<br/>                chroma:  159.04<br/>                diesis:   49.15</p><p>The defining property of this &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning proposed by Keenan<br/>Pepper is that the tone and apotome has logarithmic sizes (as<br/>meansured for example in cents) standing in the ratio of Phi, or<br/>about 1.61834. By a curious coincidence, the augmented fifth<br/>(e.g. C-G#) at 832.76 cents is very close to the interval ratio of Phi<br/>(833.090 cents).</p><p>As you would rightly have me emphasize, these are two quite different<br/>uses of Phi, as a comparison between logarithmic ratios, and as an<br/>interval ratio, which should not be confused!</p><p>With this tuning, here is how our MI interpretations of Marchetto come<br/>out:</p><p>               +159               +49<br/>          C ------------- C# -------------- D<br/>         704             943               1200<br/>          F ------------- E  -------------- D<br/>                -80              -208</p><p>The MI major sixth (from 14 fifths down or fourths up) is 942.661<br/>cents. On a 24-note keyboard layout, this might be F*-C* to E*-D<br/>to D*-D* -- with the major sixth equal to a regular minor seventh<br/>at 992 cents less the 49-cent diesis.</p><p>Now for the major third progression to a fifth:</p><p>                    +159               +49<br/>             G -------------- G# --------------- A<br/>             0               447                704<br/>             G -------------- E  --------------- D<br/>                    -288              -208</p><p>The MI major third from 13 fourths up at 446.757 cents is very close<br/>to theoretical MI. Here we might have, on a 24-note keyboard<br/>arrangement, G*-G* to the major third E*-A to D*-A* -- with the major<br/>third equal to a 496-cent fourth less the 49-cent diesis.</p><p>Thus in addition to illustrating Phi as a logarithmic ratio, and<br/>closely approximating Phi as an interval ratio with its augmented<br/>fifth, the Pepper tuning (or Wilson/Pepper, if we take into account<br/>Erv WIlson&apos;s earlier indication of this temperament on the Scale<br/>Tree), seems also for its major thirds and sixths derived from a chain<br/>of 13 or 14 generators to approximate the Phi-based MI concept, where<br/>the region of maximum complexity between two simple ratios is<br/>estimated using a Phi-weighted mediant.</p><p>To be on the safe side, I&apos;ll emphasize that temperaments (regular or<br/>otherwise) are a modern digression or diversion rather than a topic<br/>presented by Marchetto himself -- but it&apos;s fun to see how the original<br/>Pepper tuning might be considered &quot;near-optimal&quot; from the viewpoint of<br/>a modern regular system approaching the MI model you&apos;ve suggested. You<br/>might consider this a kind of tribute to your &quot;chains-of-fifths&quot; papers,<br/>from an angle that has very interestingly developed over the last eight<br/>years as to MI or the like.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;ve been meaning to ask. Can you please explain the different usages<br/>&gt;  of &quot;Marchetto&quot; and &quot;Marchettus&quot;?</p><p>As far as I know, they&apos;re simply Italian and Latin versions of the<br/>same name for the same person -- so either is correct, and the choice<br/>is a matter of one&apos;s style or mood at the moment. Here I&apos;ve tended to<br/>favor Marchetto because that&apos;s the version that you and others are<br/>mostly using. I would guess that it is a nickname or affectionate<br/>diminutive for Marcus or Marco -- just as the great composer Perotin<br/>from the era around 1200 is known by a diminutive for French Pierre (or<br/>in Latin, Petrus), here, as with Marchetto/Marchettus, the &quot;standard&quot;<br/>version of the name, and in Latin Perotinus.</p><p>Another theorist of the era around 1300, Jacobus of Liege or Jacobus<br/>de Montibus (if, as seems likely, he&apos;s the author referred to by the<br/>latter name in a source called the Berkeley Manuscript or Paris<br/>Anonymous from around 1375, with some of it carrying this date) is<br/>likewise sometimes called Jacques de Liege, or even &quot;James of Liege.&quot;</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=78304 href="#78304">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2008 5:28:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Robert,</p><p>Please let me, as someone who has been involved with this group at<br/>many points during the last ten years or so, thank you warmly for<br/>voicing some concerns which provide an opportunity for reflection and<br/>dialogue.</p><p>As I see it, we can and should indeed consider how newcomers to this<br/>area of interest -- who possibly have practiced a variety of<br/>intonations, traditional or otherwise, without specifically focusing<br/>on the matter -- might get some overview of what tuning systems can be<br/>like, and which ones they might find attractive for their own musical<br/>purposes.

However, often I use a 1024-tET/EDO<br/>version which varies very slightly from this -- and other variations,<br/>like a 100-tET/EDO version given below, are possible, with similar<br/>musical results.</p><p>The basic idea of this kind of 12-note circle is to offer intervals<br/>ranging from regular meantone to around septimal, while keeping all<br/>fifths within about 7 cents of pure. The 100-tET/EDO fifth sizes you<br/>have discussed of 696 and 708 cents do this very well.</p><p>Note that this kind of circle is most attractive if one shifts, for<br/>example, between Renaissance styles where the major thirds at 384 and<br/>396 cents are the norm, and neomedieval styles where the larger sizes<br/>of 408, 420, and 432 cents in a 100-EDO version can all happily<br/>mingle. Of course, these larger sizes can also make fine diminished<br/>fourths in a Renaissance style, e.g. A-C#-F at 0-384-816 cents with<br/>C#-F at 432 cents -- very colorful and period-appropropriate.</p><p>The full 24-note system, or larger subsets involving notes from both<br/>12-note cicles, are discussed in some other articles, often rather<br/>technical, and some inspired by papers of Erv Wilson available at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a>&gt;:</p><p>          &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-lattice.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-lattice.txt</a>&gt;<br/>          &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-RastBayyati.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-RastBayyati.txt</a>&gt;<br/>          &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt</a>&gt;<br/>          &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-septendecene.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-septendecene.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Here is a piece using both circles of Zest-24, often with an emphasis<br/>on neutral intervals and septimal colors in a style inspired by<br/>Persian music:</p><p>          &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Why don&apos;t I give 100-tET/EDO versions both of a single 12-note circle<br/>of Zest-24, and of the complete system.

Huseyni is always about a<br/>comma higher than dik hisar.</p><p>&gt; Thinking of<br/>&gt; these as the third and sixth steps of Maqam Rast in a mostly 5-limit<br/>&gt; flavor, I realize that segah might incline toward 5/4 and huseyni<br/>&gt; toward 27/16 above rast -- but here with enough &quot;tempering&quot; so that<br/>&gt; the fourth remains near 4:3.</p><p>But huseyni is already a pure 27/16 above rast. In retrospect, dik<br/>hisar comes very close to 5/3.</p><p>&gt; In the 79-MOS, for example on a qanun, I<br/>&gt; would guess that you might use the wide or meantone fourth at about<br/>&gt; 505 cents, thus something like 392-898 cents for these perdeler --<br/>&gt; indeed, I am hardly guessing, just reading and checking your papers!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ah, but you see, in 79 MOS 2deg159-tloET (I hereby instert an &quot;l&quot; to<br/>signify logarithmic, and &quot;o&quot; to imply octave), I have tempered both<br/>segah and huseyni to achieve a perfect fourth between them. I admit it<br/>is a stretch and actual segah will incline to a lower relative pitch<br/>while huseyni will tend to a higher one.</p><p>&gt; In the tuning I&apos;m now exploring, a regular 24-note system (much less<br/>&gt; clever than Yarman24) with fifths at 704.607 cents, Segah is formed a<br/>&gt; bit differently, as also in at least some Arab traditions where Rast<br/>&gt; has a tuning more like that of al-Farabi&apos;s version of Zalzal&apos;s scale<br/>&gt; for the &grave;ud or lute. Here segah might be somewhere around 27/22 above<br/>&gt; rast. In this tuning, placing perde rast for the moment at B, we have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      Maqam Rast<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           Rast          9:8        Rast<br/>&gt;     |-----------------|.....|-------------------|<br/>&gt;   Rast Dugah Segah Chargah Neva Huseyni Evdj Gerdaniye<br/>&gt;     B    C#    Eb     E     F#    G#     Bb     B<br/>&gt;     0    209   363   495   705    914   1068  1200<br/>&gt;       209   154   132   209   209    154   132<br/>&gt;</p><p>segah appears to be closer to 21/17 than 27/22, which is agreeable<br/>with the Turkish tradition. Ditto for evdj at 63/64. So far so good.</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, some of the intervals aren&apos;t so far from flavors found<br/>&gt; in Ozan24, such as 363 cents (a large 16/13 or small 100/81 or 121/98)<br/>&gt; and 1068 cents (not too narrow of 13/7); I might call this a submajor<br/>&gt; flavor of Rast, with evdj (Arabic awj) at 1068 cents notably wider<br/>&gt; than 81/44 (1057 cents) in al-Farabi&apos;s version of Zalzal&apos;s tuning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>More often than not, Rast is executed in that manner in Turkish maqammusic.</p><p>&gt; When we take the same perdeler, one flavor of what is often known in<br/>&gt; Arab theory as the &quot;fundamental scale&quot; based on perde rast, with the<br/>&gt; 1/1 on perde segah (or in Arabic, sikah), we get this very interesting<br/>&gt; result, with a curious intonational twist in this tuning:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 Maqam Segah (or Sikah)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              Rast         9:8             Rast<br/>&gt;     |-------------------|......|-------------------------|<br/>&gt;  Segah  Chargah Neva Huseyni Evdj Gerdaniye  Muhayyer Tik Segah<br/>&gt;     Eb     E     F#     G#     Bb      B       C#        Eb<br/>&gt;     0     132   342    551    705     837     1046      1200<br/>&gt;       132    210   209    154     132     209       154<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this version of Segah, the neutral third of Rast at perde segah and<br/>&gt; the major sixth at perde huseyni form a small tritone or<br/>&gt; &quot;superfourth,&quot; as Dave Keenan has well named it, which in this tuning<br/>&gt; is at a virtually just 11/8, formed by the augmented third Eb-G#. This<br/>&gt; is the one location in the tuning where a perfect fourth is not<br/>&gt; available</p><p>A wild twist! Strangely enough, the Segah character of the scale is<br/>not lost even with the introduction of the superfourth instead of a<br/>pure one. I make note of this peculiar situation. Is 11/8 as consonant<br/>as 4/3 for Segah, I wonder?</p><p>&gt; -- but the augmented third is just what we want for this<br/>&gt; flavor of Segah, and makes it possible to play these basic notes of<br/>&gt; the maqam on a single keyboard, although obviously inflections or<br/>&gt; modulations will draw on more notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The sweet polyphonic flavors of this version include a most charming<br/>&gt; final cadence:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            C#    Eb<br/>&gt;            G#    Bb<br/>&gt;            E     Eb<br/>&gt;</p><p>A splendid Segah cadence!</p><p>&gt; The major third and sixth of E-G#-C# at 0-418-914 cents resolve to the<br/>&gt; fifth and octave, with the lowest voice descending by 132 cents and<br/>&gt; the upper ones ascending by 154 cents. This is deliciously a &quot;middle<br/>&gt; second&quot; flavor, what George Secor has termed an equable cadence.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I admit it is very attractive.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, looking at some of your tunings, I noted the feature that two<br/>&gt; different flavors of neutral intervals such as thirds and sixths may<br/>&gt; be available above a single perde or step such as rast, as happens<br/>&gt; delightfully with middle thirds and sevenths in Ozan24, and of course<br/>&gt; with many shadings in 79-MOS.

Two more steps are<br/>&gt; added so that we can have two pairs of tritones: the middle ones<br/>&gt; closer to 600 cents fitting the regular chain of fifths, and the<br/>&gt; smallest and largest at a virtually just 11/8 and 16/11.

If we count 1/1 and 2/1 as distinct<br/>&gt; steps, then we have 24 steps in all within and including an octave:<br/>&gt; and these form 12 pairs, each adding up to 1200 cents: thus<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               1/1 (0)       2/1 (1200)<br/>&gt;                   77             1123<br/>&gt;                  132             1067<br/>&gt;                  154             1046<br/>&gt;                  ....            ....<br/>&gt;                  572              628<br/>&gt;</p><p>Interesting symmetry!</p><p>&gt; This degree of temperament is quite close to the 705-cent system we<br/>&gt; have discussed, or 63-EDO which is very similar, as you observed. A<br/>&gt; compromise of this slightly milder tempering of the fifth is that<br/>&gt; 11/9, 13/8, 11/6, and especially 9/7 will be less accurate. A possible<br/>&gt; benefit is that we have virtually just versions of 7/4, 11/8, and also<br/>&gt; 23/16 (the regular tritone), a ratio mentioned in your 79-MOS<br/>&gt; presentations. An open question is whether 132 cents or 68/63 is low<br/>&gt; enough for a dik kurdi (as in Yarman24) and yet high enough for a very<br/>&gt; low segah in Maqam Huseyni or Ushshaq (or some related flavors).<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think 132 cents is just right for a dik kurdi suitable for Nihavend,<br/>Ushshaq and Hijaz maqams.</p><p>&gt; Of course, as should be made plain, the full 24-note tuning is meant<br/>&gt; to be used where ratios of 2-3-7-11-13 are desired, but does not<br/>&gt; really represent ratios of 5, although a few odd meantone-size<br/>&gt; intervals are present involving very long chains of fifths.

I am keeping in mind that one<br/>learns a maqam not by merely considering the intervals in cents, but<br/>by listening and playing taksim.</p><p>Another post of yours from August 9, which somehow I only found on<br/>Yahoo this week -- my apologies for failing to notice it earlier! --<br/>reminded me of a related point. This is the humorous story promised<br/>above.</p><p>It is said in chess that one should not make a move without knowing<br/>what the next move is likely to be -- and the one after that!</p><p>Similarly, before attempting to discuss the tuning of a maqam such as<br/>Suz-i Dilara as that name is understood in Turkey, I would be wise to<br/>learn something about its seyir! When I learned from your post the<br/>difference between Mahur and Suz-i Dilara, the latter an intricate<br/>terkib, this lesson was really driven home. By the way, my last<br/>sentence certainly is not meant to imply that any maqam is other than<br/>&quot;intricate&quot; -- especially to those who know it well.</p><p>Now for the philosophical reflection, much helped by reviewing some of<br/>your earlier posts over the last few years which help me to put the<br/>question of Rast/Mahur/Suz-i-Dilara in better perspective.</p><p>If I write what is to follow well, by the way, I hope that some of it<br/>may be of interest even to those who might not be so concerned with<br/>the specific technical questions we are addressing.</p><p>&gt; I still find it important that the simplest 5-limit JI can be<br/>&gt; represented on some keys, and a 12-tone cycle is achieved for<br/>&gt; common- practice footing.</p><p>Please let me hasten to agree that for the musical styles and<br/>situations you address, these requirements are indeed vital: the<br/>79-MOS addresses them superbly, and Ozan24 shows how they can be<br/>addressed quite ingeniously with much more modest resources. Indeed I<br/>might regard the 79-MOS as a palatial estate filled with many fragrant<br/>gardens, each offering a different musical flavor from some region or<br/>style of the Maqam/Dastgah world.</p><p>In contrast, the 704.607-cent or &quot;e-based&quot; tuning is like a small and<br/>quiet garden with curious plants and flowers that may offer some<br/>special colors and flavors. It is meant to be a charming sample from<br/>the vast world of Maqam/Dastgah music -- but by no means a complete or<br/>even representative one!</p><p>Also, the &quot;footing&quot; for this tuning is different: to support a certain<br/>pleasant but limited range of Maqam/Dastgah flavors, plus a reasonable<br/>if modern version of the European &quot;common practice,&quot; as I might call<br/>it, of the 13th-14th centuries, in part coinciding with the late<br/>Mutazilah era. For this latter purpose, each keyboard presents a<br/>tempered variation on the 12-note Pythagorean tuning (Eb-G#) which<br/>seems to have been very common on 14th-century keyboards.</p><p>A regular temperament with fifths tempered by about 2.65 cents might<br/>be at about the maximum degree of impurity for 3:2 and 4:3 that I<br/>would be comfortable using when seeking something not too far from a<br/>medieval European sound. The other regular diatonic intervals for<br/>13th-14th century European purposes are somewhat accentuated -- major<br/>intervals wider, minor ones narrower -- which can be both congenial<br/>and musically exciting. Special cadences like those of Marchettus of<br/>Padua using yet more accentuated intervals are also available.</p><p>As someone whose musical formation and training focus largely on<br/>medieval European music, I feel right at home. However, here it might<br/>not be out of place to quote the proverb of a 16th-century English<br/>musician named Thomas Morley -- &quot;Such lips, such lettuce,&quot; said while<br/>watching a donkey eating thistles!</p><p>In a setting where it is important either to represent the full range<br/>of Maqam/Dastgah colors, or to support music on a &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>footing in the usual sense of major/minor tonality, it is very easy<br/>to show why this tuning will fail, Ozan24 will succeed with the<br/>same number of notes per octave, and the 79-MOS on the qanun or<br/>another instrument will, of course, succeed brilliantly.</p><p>From that perspective, I might say that my regular tuning fails in<br/>some of the same ways as AEU -- requiring a broken chain of fifths for<br/>a reasonable Rast, having C# always higher than Db -- but may possibly<br/>fail in somewhat more interesting ways &lt;grin&gt;. Instead of almost<br/>nothing being acknowledged as a middle or neutral interval, we might<br/>slightly exaggerate by saying that almost everything might seem to be<br/>a middle interval or to produce one, including the apotome of 132<br/>cents, almost 6 commas, or not quite 9 yarmans (each equal to about<br/>2/3 of a Holdrian comma, although the size of a yarman may minutely<br/>vary, like the secor, depending on the implementation of the 79-MOS).</p><p>Thus if one seeks a 5-limit Rast, with AEU one will have the right<br/>interval sizes but in the wrong places for an unbroken chain of fifths<br/>and regular note spellings for this maqam.</p><p>With the e-based tuning, one will have the wrong interval sizes in the<br/>wrong places &lt;grin&gt;. From another point of view, we indeed have the<br/>right sizes for another flavor of Rast which you have mentioned as<br/>used in Turkey: 363 and 1068 cents, close to 21/17 and 63/34, and also<br/>for Ajemli Rast a sixth at 859 cents, close to 23/14. However, these<br/>are not 5-limit intervals, nor are they based on an unbroken chain of<br/>fifths permitting regular diatonic spellings. Rather, they result from<br/>precisely the same types of spellings that produce near-pure 5-limit<br/>intervals in AEU: e.g. F#-Bb, F#-Eb, and F#-F at 363/859/1068 cents<br/>here and 384/882/1086 cents in AEU.</p><p>The strategy of this 704.607-cent temperament is in some ways a very<br/>modest one: the aim is specifically to support a certain subset of<br/>Maqam/Dastgah flavors, plus 13th-14th century European common practice<br/>(quite different from the 18th-19th century &quot;common practice&quot; usually<br/>identified with that phrase). It is meant, as mentioned above, to be a<br/>small and modest garden, another musical perspective which might serve<br/>to highlight the much vaster territory and range of maqam structures<br/>and flavors covered by a system like the 79-MOS.</p><p>&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Oz.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=78427 href="#78427">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2008 8:14:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A late response (with all due apologies):</p><p>On Aug 31, 2008, at 11:17 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Please let me say what a pleasure it is to be discussing the maqamat<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; or makamlar with you: as always, both educational and enlightening.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a movement afoot to revive the learning of the Mutazilah<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Era?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Ah, your sentiments are much refreshing.

I am keeping in mind that one<br/>&gt; learns a maqam not by merely considering the intervals in cents, but<br/>&gt; by listening and playing taksim.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Indeed so.</p><p>&gt; Another post of yours from August 9, which somehow I only found on<br/>&gt; Yahoo this week -- my apologies for failing to notice it earlier! --<br/>&gt; reminded me of a related point. This is the humorous story promised<br/>&gt; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is said in chess that one should not make a move without knowing<br/>&gt; what the next move is likely to be -- and the one after that!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, before attempting to discuss the tuning of a maqam such as<br/>&gt; Suz-i Dilara as that name is understood in Turkey, I would be wise to<br/>&gt; learn something about its seyir! When I learned from your post the<br/>&gt; difference between Mahur and Suz-i Dilara, the latter an intricate<br/>&gt; terkib, this lesson was really driven home. By the way, my last<br/>&gt; sentence certainly is not meant to imply that any maqam is other than<br/>&gt; &quot;intricate&quot; -- especially to those who know it well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for the philosophical reflection, much helped by reviewing some of<br/>&gt; your earlier posts over the last few years which help me to put the<br/>&gt; question of Rast/Mahur/Suz-i-Dilara in better perspective.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Glad to know my meager knowledge was useful.</p><p>&gt; If I write what is to follow well, by the way, I hope that some of it<br/>&gt; may be of interest even to those who might not be so concerned with<br/>&gt; the specific technical questions we are addressing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I still find it important that the simplest 5-limit JI can be<br/>&gt;&gt; represented on some keys, and a 12-tone cycle is achieved for<br/>&gt;&gt; common- practice footing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me hasten to agree that for the musical styles and<br/>&gt; situations you address, these requirements are indeed vital: the<br/>&gt; 79-MOS addresses them superbly, and Ozan24 shows how they can be<br/>&gt; addressed quite ingeniously with much more modest resources.</p><p>I think it best to call it Yarman24. Sorting out Scala scales that I<br/>came up with during my presence on the tuning list is still in the<br/>back of my mind.</p><p>Thank you for your acknowledgment of my points above!</p><p>&gt; Indeed I<br/>&gt; might regard the 79-MOS as a palatial estate filled with many fragrant<br/>&gt; gardens, each offering a different musical flavor from some region or<br/>&gt; style of the Maqam/Dastgah world.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oh that is a very charming description. However I tend to think it is<br/>more like a jungle!</p><p>&gt; In contrast, the 704.607-cent or &quot;e-based&quot; tuning is like a small and<br/>&gt; quiet garden with curious plants and flowers that may offer some<br/>&gt; special colors and flavors. It is meant to be a charming sample from<br/>&gt; the vast world of Maqam/Dastgah music -- but by no means a complete or<br/>&gt; even representative one!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Despite all this modesty, I am inclined to admit that the 705 cent<br/>tuning produces much agreeable results from the perspective of maqam<br/>theory.</p><p>&gt; Also, the &quot;footing&quot; for this tuning is different: to support a certain<br/>&gt; pleasant but limited range of Maqam/Dastgah flavors, plus a reasonable<br/>&gt; if modern version of the European &quot;common practice,&quot; as I might call<br/>&gt; it, of the 13th-14th centuries, in part coinciding with the late<br/>&gt; Mutazilah era. For this latter purpose, each keyboard presents a<br/>&gt; tempered variation on the 12-note Pythagorean tuning (Eb-G#) which<br/>&gt; seems to have been very common on 14th-century keyboards.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Charming!</p><p>&gt; A regular temperament with fifths tempered by about 2.65 cents might<br/>&gt; be at about the maximum degree of impurity for 3:2 and 4:3 that I<br/>&gt; would be comfortable using when seeking something not too far from a<br/>&gt; medieval European sound.</p><p>That is indeed about as much impurity one can tolerate in the building<br/>of maqam tetrachords and pentachords too.</p><p>&gt; The other regular diatonic intervals for<br/>&gt; 13th-14th century European purposes are somewhat accentuated -- major<br/>&gt; intervals wider, minor ones narrower -- which can be both congenial<br/>&gt; and musically exciting. Special cadences like those of Marchettus of<br/>&gt; Padua using yet more accentuated intervals are also available.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Delightful.</p><p>&gt; As someone whose musical formation and training focus largely on<br/>&gt; medieval European music, I feel right at home. However, here it might<br/>&gt; not be out of place to quote the proverb of a 16th-century English<br/>&gt; musician named Thomas Morley -- &quot;Such lips, such lettuce,&quot; said while<br/>&gt; watching a donkey eating thistles!<br/>&gt;</p><p>LOL! That is a cute proverb, but I feel it does grave injustice to<br/>your attire. Your tuning does indeed seem to reflect the musical<br/>spirit of Medieval Europe as well as house many maqam/dastgah flavours.</p><p>&gt; In a setting where it is important either to represent the full range<br/>&gt; of Maqam/Dastgah colors, or to support music on a &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>&gt; footing in the usual sense of major/minor tonality, it is very easy<br/>&gt; to show why this tuning will fail, Ozan24 will succeed with the<br/>&gt; same number of notes per octave, and the 79-MOS on the qanun or<br/>&gt; another instrument will, of course, succeed brilliantly.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very nicely stated. Conversely, Yarman24 and 79 MOS 2deg159-tET will<br/>surely fail in representing Medieval cadences that you have<br/>accentuated many times in our correspondences.</p><p>&gt; From that perspective, I might say that my regular tuning fails in<br/>&gt; some of the same ways as AEU -- requiring a broken chain of fifths for<br/>&gt; a reasonable Rast, having C# always higher than Db -- but may possibly<br/>&gt; fail in somewhat more interesting ways &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Duely acknowledged.</p><p>&gt; Instead of almost<br/>&gt; nothing being acknowledged as a middle or neutral interval, we might<br/>&gt; slightly exaggerate by saying that almost everything might seem to be<br/>&gt; a middle interval or to produce one, including the apotome of 132<br/>&gt; cents, almost 6 commas, or not quite 9 yarmans (each equal to about<br/>&gt; 2/3 of a Holdrian comma, although the size of a yarman may minutely<br/>&gt; vary, like the secor, depending on the implementation of the 79-MOS).<br/>&gt;</p><p>How nice of you to dub the 2/3 Holderian commas as a yarman unit, and<br/>how pleasing to see that you noticed the variation of its size<br/>depending on which approach one uses to derive 79 MOS 2deg159-tET.</p><p>&gt; Thus if one seeks a 5-limit Rast, with AEU one will have the right<br/>&gt; interval sizes but in the wrong places for an unbroken chain of fifths<br/>&gt; and regular note spellings for this maqam.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the e-based tuning, one will have the wrong interval sizes in the<br/>&gt; wrong places &lt;grin&gt;. From another point of view, we indeed have the<br/>&gt; right sizes for another flavor of Rast which you have mentioned as<br/>&gt; used in Turkey: 363 and 1068 cents, close to 21/17 and 63/34, and also<br/>&gt; for Ajemli Rast a sixth at 859 cents, close to 23/14. However, these<br/>&gt; are not 5-limit intervals, nor are they based on an unbroken chain of<br/>&gt; fifths permitting regular diatonic spellings. Rather, they result from<br/>&gt; precisely the same types of spellings that produce near-pure 5-limit<br/>&gt; intervals in AEU: e.g. F#-Bb, F#-Eb, and F#-F at 363/859/1068 cents<br/>&gt; here and 384/882/1086 cents in AEU.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The strategy of this 704.607-cent temperament is in some ways a very<br/>&gt; modest one: the aim is specifically to support a certain subset of<br/>&gt; Maqam/Dastgah flavors, plus 13th-14th century European common practice<br/>&gt; (quite different from the 18th-19th century &quot;common practice&quot; usually<br/>&gt; identified with that phrase). It is meant, as mentioned above, to be a<br/>&gt; small and modest garden, another musical perspective which might serve<br/>&gt; to highlight the much vaster territory and range of maqam structures<br/>&gt; and flavors covered by a system like the 79-MOS.<br/>&gt;</p><p>And your tuning does a splendid job too.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=78473 href="#78473">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2008 9:33:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Re: [tuning] Re: For Ozan: Segah flavors</p><p>&gt; A late response (with all due apologies):</p><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Please let me emphasize that no apologies are necessary, and that to<br/>discuss the maqamat in this way is a delightful dialogue and<br/>education.

Usage of 5/3 with 16/9<br/>&gt; would be reminiscent of a descending Huzzam scale.</p><p>And thus the 27:20 wide fourths at Ed-A -- as also in a 5-limit<br/>version of Maqam Rast; in the 79-MOS, we might choose the compromise<br/>of having segah at 392 cents and huseyni at 898 cents, a meantone<br/>fourth apart; but I am not sure how desirable this would be for Maqam<br/>Segah.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Your ideas about the 132-231-132 tetrachord can lead in some<br/>&gt;&gt; fascinating directions, hwoever suited or otherwise for a given maqam;<br/>&gt;&gt; what I want to share here is mainly the sheer excitement of exploring<br/>&gt;&gt; these different flavors.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m pleased you find the mujannab-tanini-mujannab (JTJ) tetrachord<br/>&gt; useful.</p><p>Yes, I have seen that notation in some notes to a CD offering a<br/>performance of some musical examples from Safi al-Din al-Urmawi. Here<br/>a point is that T or tanini, while it often means 9:8 or 9 commas (a<br/>usual whole tone), may also mean 8:7 or 10 commas.</p><p>Generally, I understand that JTJ may be called &grave;Iraq.</p><p>A tetrachord of 132-231-132 or roughly 6-10-6 commas, is what I would<br/>call Buzurg, after the lower tetrachord of a tuning by that name given<br/>by Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi as 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3-56/39-3/2 or<br/>14/13x8/7x13/12x14/13x117/112 (128-231-139-128-76). Of course, I know<br/>that this name means many different things to many different people.</p><p>Here the difference between 14:13 and 13:12, or 169:168, is tempered<br/>out, so that 132 cents may stand for either.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Please let me hasten to agree that for the musical styles and<br/>&gt;&gt; situations you address, these requirements are indeed vital: the &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 79-MOS addresses them superbly, and Ozan24 shows how they can be &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; addressed quite ingeniously with much more modest resources.</p><p>&gt; I think it best to call it Yarman24. Sorting out Scala scales that I<br/>&gt; came up with during my presence on the tuning list is still in the<br/>&gt; back of my mind.</p><p>Noted! I will remember: Yarman24.</p><p>&gt; Thank you for your acknowledgment of my points above!</p><p>Reading some of your discussions about recent Turkish theory and the<br/>79-MOS has helped me to get a better perspective.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Indeed I might regard the 79-MOS as a palatial estate filled with<br/>&gt;&gt; many fragrant gardens, each offering a different musical flavor<br/>&gt;&gt; from some region or style of the Maqam/Dastgah world.</p><p>&gt; Oh that is a very charming description. However I tend to think it<br/>&gt; is more like a jungle!</p><p>At times, I now realize through a bit of consideration, the need to<br/>get as many intervals and practical chains of fifths as possible into<br/>even a 79-note tuning may require some compromises, as I found when<br/>trying to locate some medieval European progressions you mention<br/>below.</p><p>From one perspective, a full 159-EDO might be ideal; from another, the<br/>artistry of a 79-tone qanun such as your wonderful innovation shows<br/>that the art of the intricate but possible is not to be disdained!</p><p>With the regular 704.607-cent tuning, also, there are some real<br/>compromises even in covering a narrower ground: for example, the use<br/>of a single 132-cent size for both 14/13 and 13/12. Curiously, both<br/>this tuning and the 79-MOS involve some compromises here, although at<br/>some locations you have a virtually just 14:13 at 127-129 cents<br/>(varying minutely in size among these locations).</p><p>&gt;&gt; In contrast, the 704.607-cent or &quot;e-based&quot; tuning is like a small<br/>&gt;&gt; and quiet garden with curious plants and flowers that may offer<br/>&gt;&gt; some special colors and flavors. It is meant to be a charming<br/>&gt;&gt; sample from the vast world of Maqam/Dastgah music -- but by no<br/>&gt;&gt; means a complete or even representative one!  &gt;</p><p>&gt; Despite all this modesty, I am inclined to admit that the 705 cent<br/>&gt; tuning produces much agreeable results from the perspective of maqam<br/>&gt; theory.</p><p>This is most welcome feedback. What I would love to do is to explore<br/>this system with some guidance on your part, for I relish our<br/>dialogues, and wonder if the process may possibly lead to any new<br/>insights or refinements as to maqam music in a kind of 24-note system<br/>which may not be of the most familiar type either for European music<br/>or for al-Musiqa al-Sharqiyya (&quot;Eastern Music&quot;) as it is often called<br/>in Arabic, I now know.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A regular temperament with fifths tempered by about 2.65 cents<br/>&gt;&gt; might be at about the maximum degree of impurity for 3:2 and 4:3<br/>&gt;&gt; that I would be comfortable using when seeking something not too<br/>&gt;&gt; far from a medieval European sound.</p><p>&gt; That is indeed about as much impurity one can tolerate in the<br/>&gt; building of maqam tetrachords and pentachords too.</p><p>Happily, it seems to be just sufficient, when tempering in the wide<br/>direction, to obtain some reasonable septimal flavors from chains of<br/>13, 14, or 15 generators for 9:7, 7:6, and 7:4.</p><p>&gt;&gt; As someone whose musical formation and training focus largely on<br/>&gt;&gt; medieval European music, I feel right at home. However, here it<br/>&gt;&gt; might not be out of place to quote the proverb of a 16th-century<br/>&gt;&gt; English musician named Thomas Morley -- &quot;Such lips, such lettuce,&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; said while watching a donkey eating thistles!</p><p>&gt; LOL! That is a cute proverb, but I feel it does grave injustice to<br/>&gt; your attire. Your tuning does indeed seem to reflect the musical<br/>&gt; spirit of Medieval Europe as well as house many maqam/dastgah<br/>&gt; flavours.</p><p>Now the challenge is for me to learn some of those flavors, with your<br/>fine examples of qanun music for inspiration.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In a setting where it is important either to represent the full range<br/>&gt;&gt; of Maqam/Dastgah colors, or to support music on a &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; footing in the usual sense of major/minor tonality, it is very easy<br/>&gt;&gt; to show why this tuning will fail, Ozan24 will succeed with the<br/>&gt;&gt; same number of notes per octave, and the 79-MOS on the qanun or<br/>&gt;&gt; another instrument will, of course, succeed brilliantly.</p><p>&gt; Very nicely stated. Conversely, Yarman24 and 79 MOS 2deg159-tET will<br/>&gt; surely fail in representing Medieval cadences that you have<br/>&gt; accentuated many times in our correspondences.</p><p>Here I found, upon considering the 79-MOS closely, that indeed one<br/>will often need to use tempered rather than pure fourths and fifths in<br/>such cadences. This is one necessary compromise involved in making<br/>available the chains of tempered fifths required for the smooth<br/>management of maqam flavors and modulations.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Instead of almost nothing being acknowledged as a middle or neutral<br/>&gt;&gt; interval, we might slightly exaggerate by saying that almost<br/>&gt;&gt; everything might seem to be a middle interval or to produce one,<br/>&gt;&gt; including the apotome of 132 cents, almost 6 commas, or not quite 9<br/>&gt;&gt; yarmans (each equal to about 2/3 of a Holdrian comma, although the<br/>&gt;&gt; size of a yarman may minutely vary, like the secor, depending on<br/>&gt;&gt; the implementation of the 79-MOS).</p><p>&gt; How nice of you to dub the 2/3 Holderian commas as a yarman unit,<br/>&gt; and how pleasing to see that you noticed the variation of its size<br/>&gt; depending on which approach one uses to derive 79 MOS 2deg159-tET.</p><p>Yes, that is a great subtlety of the tuning, as when I noticed at one<br/>location an approximation of 14:13 at not quite 127 cents, and then<br/>used Scala to find that a range of sizes from 127-129 cents or so are<br/>present from different perdeler.</p><p>[...]</p><p>&gt; And your tuning does a splendid job too.</p><p>The challenge is for me to learn to use it well.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=78488 href="#78488">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2008 5:39:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My replies are below:</p><p>On Sep 12, 2008, at 7:33 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Re: [tuning] Re: For Ozan: Segah flavors<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A late response (with all due apologies):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Ozan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me emphasize that no apologies are necessary, and that to<br/>&gt; discuss the maqamat in this way is a delightful dialogue and<br/>&gt; education.</p><p>Very pleased to know it.</p><p>&gt; I am reminded of some of the dialogues in classic European<br/>&gt; counterpoint texts such as Morley (1597) and Fux (1725).

After sunbule comes tiz segah,<br/>&gt;&gt; not tik.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, I see that I must have confused tik, an Arab term which may<br/>&gt; correspond to dik (meaning a &quot;steep&quot; or elevated version of a given<br/>&gt; perde within the octave), with the intended tiz to show the higher<br/>&gt; octave.

If 859 cents is by definition dik hisar<br/>&gt; as the perfect fourth of segah at 363 cents, then might 837 cents best<br/>&gt; be called simply hisar? Here, taking F# as rast, this note would be<br/>&gt; located at D*, or 473 cents above segah, a narrow fourth very close to<br/>&gt; 21:16, and smaller than perfect by a comma.</p><p>Ordinarily the distance between segah and dik hisar must always be a<br/>perfect fourth. But now I see the problem. Your segah is way too low.<br/>In that case, dik hisar is pulled down along with segah to what would<br/>by default be the position of our classical hisar at 18/11. In its<br/>stead, hisar now occupies the position a comma lower at 837 cents.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For the ascending version, I hit on the obvious Hijaz tetrachord with<br/>&gt;&gt; perde kurdi:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;                           Ascending<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;            Segah            tone              Hijaz<br/>&gt;&gt;    |----------------------|.......|--------------------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;  segah  chargah   neva  hisar    evdj  gerdaniye  s&not;&prod;nb&not;&prod;le<br/>&gt;&gt; tik segah<br/>&gt;&gt;    Bb      B       C#     Eb      F        F#        A       Bb<br/>&gt;&gt;    0      132     341    495     705      837      1123     1200<br/>&gt;&gt;       132     209    154     209      132      286       77<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This is also very nice, but mind the dik hisar. Once more, after<br/>&gt;&gt; sunbule comes tiz segah, not tik.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This must have again been my confusion of Arabic tik (=dik) with the<br/>&gt; correct tiz for a higher octave.

Also, the acute fifth between neva and<br/>&gt;&gt; what you call dik muhayyer is puzzling. If you call it nim sunbule<br/>&gt;&gt; instead of dik muhayyer, that would hit the spot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me correct my example accordingly, and also emend the &apos;tik<br/>&gt; segah&apos; to tiz segah:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;                           Ascending<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;            Segah            tone              Hijaz<br/>&gt;&gt;    |----------------------|.......|--------------------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;                                                     nim     tiz<br/>&gt;&gt;  segah  chargah   neva  hisar    evdj  gerdaniye  s&cedil;nb&cedil;le  segah<br/>&gt;&gt;    Bb*     B*     C#*    Eb*      F*      F#*        A       Bb*<br/>&gt;&gt;    0      132     341    495     705      837      1068     1200<br/>&gt;&gt;       132     209    154     209      132      231      132<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes this is correct. But why write sunbule as s,nb,le?</p><p>&gt; This matter of nim s&cedil;nb&cedil;le rather than dik muhayyer as the apt name<br/>&gt; here raises a more general question. As a beginner, I was unsure about<br/>&gt; the best name for a step at 231 cents or 8:7 above rast (or its octave<br/>&gt; gerdaniye) when I looked at your names in one listing of the 79-MOS:<br/>&gt; dik dugah at 211 cents (the next step above dugah); sarp dugah at 226<br/>&gt; cents (the closest to 8:7); and nim kurdi at 242 cents. Now I know<br/>&gt; that nim kurdi, or nim s&cedil;nb&cedil;le, is the best choice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe I could best show how I tried to reason out the problem like<br/>&gt; this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                        limma<br/>&gt;      |------------------ 77 -----------------|<br/>&gt;      |----- 22 ----|---------- 55 -----------|<br/>&gt;     G#*    comma   A         diesis          A*<br/>&gt;    dugah           ?                        kurdi<br/>&gt;     209           231                       286<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the basic perdeler, dugah and kurdi, are a regular limma apart,<br/>&gt; or 77 cents, a bit smaller than the Pythagorean limma of 4 commas. In<br/>&gt; this tuning system, I might guess that dik or possibly sarp could mean<br/>&gt; &quot;a 22-cent comma higher,&quot; and nim &quot;a 55-cent diesis lower.&quot;  Here I<br/>&gt; have now learned that nim kurdi or &quot;a diesis below kurdi&quot; is the right<br/>&gt; answer, rather than dik dugah or possibly sarp dugah, &quot;a comma above<br/>&gt; dugah.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Exactly! Because you have chosen an acute fifth as the generator of<br/>your tuning, the commas and diaschismas have grown in size to dieses,<br/>which you must take into account in the naming of perdeler instead of<br/>the 22-cent comma (Ptolemy&apos;s comma?)</p><p>&gt; My beginner&apos;s curiosity leads me to wonder if there is any general<br/>&gt; rule<br/>&gt; for naming a step in this sort of situation -- but looking at your<br/>&gt; article on 34-tone, 79-tone, and other systems, I might conclude that<br/>&gt; the intermediate steps between basic perde a limma apart like rast-<br/>&gt; shuri,<br/>&gt; dugah-kurdi, buselik-chargah, neva-beyati, and huseyni-ajem might each<br/>&gt; have their own rules or local customs, so to speak. This might reflect<br/>&gt; the wealth of maqamat and nuances of modulation.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am inclined to say that almost all Middle Eastern traditions agree<br/>on the size of the limma as being somewhere between 80-100 cents. In<br/>naming perdes that are narrower, you have to keep track of not only<br/>their distance from the previous and next perde, but also the<br/>relationships with other distant perdes as I have tried to demonstrate<br/>in the example of Segah.</p><p>&gt; Maybe like someone learning a language, I might better learn by lots<br/>&gt; of practice with the guidance of a good native speaker, rather than<br/>&gt; trying to understand all of the fine points of grammar at once!</p><p>You might have a point there.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I have reconsidered using huseyni in place of dik hisar, and came up<br/>&gt;&gt; with three Yarman24 scales for maqam Segah:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (ascending =&gt;) Ed 112 F 204 G 204 A 182 Bd 112 C 204 D 182 Ed<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (ascending =&gt;) Eb 112 F 204 G 204 A 182 Bd 112 C 292 D# 94 Ed<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very small point: here I suspect that in the second tuning, Ed<br/>&gt; rather than Eb (perde kurdi) is meant, as the 112-cent step to F<br/>&gt; confirms. In other words, these two versions have identical lower<br/>&gt; pentachords, with only the upper tetrachords varying.</p><p>That is right.</p><p>&gt; In commas, I<br/>&gt; might write these upper tetrachords as 5-9-8 (rather like Kurdi,<br/>&gt; 4-9-9) and around 5-13-4 (a kind of Hijaz).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Like Kurdi, but is not. We call that a Segah or Iraq tetrachord. A<br/>kind of Hijaz is correct. In AEU theory, the Hijaz tetrachord varies<br/>in size from 5-12-5 to 5-13-4 to 4-13-5 commas.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Eb 112 F 204 G 204 A 90 Bb 204 C 204 D 88 Eb (&lt;= descending)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I wonder if the tonic or final is meant to be Ed rather than Eb,<br/>&gt; as the 112-cent step up to F again suggests -- and whether, given the<br/>&gt; the first step of the descent at 88 cents, the highest note should be,<br/>&gt; rather than Eb, a D# or s&cedil;nb&cedil;le. I am very ready to be corrected!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Uh oh. I made a typographical mistake. That should have been, as you<br/>have noticed, Ed not Eb in the bottom note. However, the top note is<br/>correct. It IS an Eb (sunbule) that is equivalent to a D# but spelled<br/>as Eb due to the diatonical requirements of the maqam. Notice that D#<br/>(not shown) is the leading tone exactly an octave below sunbule! Here<br/>we have D#-Eb as the octave. Curious, is it not?</p><p>&gt; 386    498   702   906    996    0    204   292<br/>&gt; 5/4    4/3   3/2  27/16  16/9   1/1   9/8 ~32/27<br/>&gt;&gt; Ed 112 F 204 G 204 A 90  Bb 204 C 204 D 88 D# (&lt;= descending)<br/>&gt;  0     112   316   520   610    814  1018  1106<br/>&gt; 1/1   16/15  6/5  27/20 64/45   8/5   9/5 ~256/135<br/>&gt;                                          or 36/19<br/>&gt;</p><p>Your top ratios are correct. I cannot check the bottom ones, but I<br/>assume them to be correct too.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  note ratio  cent PERDE<br/>&gt;&gt;  Ed    5/4   386  segah<br/>&gt;&gt;  F     4/3   498  tschargah<br/>&gt;&gt;  G     3/2   702  neva<br/>&gt;&gt;  A    27/16  906  huseyni<br/>&gt;&gt;  Bb   16/9   996  ajem<br/>&gt;&gt;  Bd   15/8  1088  evdj<br/>&gt;&gt;  C     2/1  1200  gerdaniye<br/>&gt;&gt;  D     9/4  1404  muhayyer<br/>&gt;&gt;  D#         1492  sunbule<br/>&gt;&gt;  Ed    5/2  1586  tiz segah<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If my guess happens to be right, then I might take as an example of<br/>&gt; lowering both the fifth and the octave above the final by a limma or<br/>&gt; so in order to add impetus to the descent. Here I think of the Persian<br/>&gt; Shur Dastgah, where the fifth above the final is often a motaqayyer,<br/>&gt; being lowered in descending passages by a koron equal to something<br/>&gt; like 50-70 cents, or a bit less than the usual limma.</p><p>Here, as the characteristic of Segah&apos;s descent, we lower the fifth and<br/>the octave of the finalis by exactly a limma. You are a keen observer!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I think using 27/16 in place of 5/3 (keeping huseyni-muhayyer a pure<br/>&gt;&gt; fourth) is more characteristic of Segah. Usage of 5/3 with 16/9<br/>&gt;&gt; would be reminiscent of a descending Huzzam scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And thus the 27:20 wide fourths at Ed-A -- as also in a 5-limit<br/>&gt; version of Maqam Rast; in the 79-MOS, we might choose the compromise<br/>&gt; of having segah at 392 cents and huseyni at 898 cents, a meantone<br/>&gt; fourth apart; but I am not sure how desirable this would be for Maqam<br/>&gt; Segah.</p><p>You can always reassign segah to 377 cents to fix matters straight. In<br/>fact, I was quite undecided even after the acceptance of my doctorate<br/>thesis and still am about the Segah business. Ordinarily, I wanted to<br/>keep segah-huseyni a perfect fourth, but I see now that this approach<br/>lends itself to certain abuses within historical context! For you see,<br/>perdes segah and huseyni have opposite poles of attraction.<br/>Fortunately, the huge resolution of 79 MOS 2deg159-tET takes care of matters by itself depending on how you make use of it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Your ideas about the 132-231-132 tetrachord can lead in some<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fascinating directions, hwoever suited or otherwise for a given<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; maqam;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; what I want to share here is mainly the sheer excitement of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; exploring<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; these different flavors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m pleased you find the mujannab-tanini-mujannab (JTJ) tetrachord<br/>&gt;&gt; useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I have seen that notation in some notes to a CD offering a<br/>&gt; performance of some musical examples from Safi al-Din al-Urmawi. Here<br/>&gt; a point is that T or tanini, while it often means 9:8 or 9 commas (a<br/>&gt; usual whole tone), may also mean 8:7 or 10 commas.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt; Generally, I understand that JTJ may be called &grave;Iraq.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Also Hijazi by Ladikli Mehmet Chelebi during the reign of Mehmet the<br/>Conqueror.</p><p>&gt; A tetrachord of 132-231-132 or roughly 6-10-6 commas, is what I would<br/>&gt; call Buzurg, after the lower tetrachord of a tuning by that name given<br/>&gt; by Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi as 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3-56/39-3/2 or<br/>&gt; 14/13x8/7x13/12x14/13x117/112 (128-231-139-128-76). Of course, I know<br/>&gt; that this name means many different things to many different people.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I like that tetrachord! In fact, you can hear that tetrachord chanted<br/>by our best muezzins in Istanbul during the evening call to prayer.</p><p>&gt; Here the difference between 14:13 and 13:12, or 169:168, is tempered<br/>&gt; out, so that 132 cents may stand for either.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I too cannot differentiate between the two 13-limit ratios in<br/>79MOS2deg159-tET.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Please let me hasten to agree that for the musical styles and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; situations you address, these requirements are indeed vital: the &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 79-MOS addresses them superbly, and Ozan24 shows how they can be &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; addressed quite ingeniously with much more modest resources.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I think it best to call it Yarman24. Sorting out Scala scales that I<br/>&gt;&gt; came up with during my presence on the tuning list is still in the<br/>&gt;&gt; back of my mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Noted! I will remember: Yarman24.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Thank you for your acknowledgment of my points above!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reading some of your discussions about recent Turkish theory and the<br/>&gt; 79-MOS has helped me to get a better perspective.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Once again, a big thank you!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed I might regard the 79-MOS as a palatial estate filled with<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; many fragrant gardens, each offering a different musical flavor<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; from some region or style of the Maqam/Dastgah world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Oh that is a very charming description. However I tend to think it<br/>&gt;&gt; is more like a jungle!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At times, I now realize through a bit of consideration, the need to<br/>&gt; get as many intervals and practical chains of fifths as possible into<br/>&gt; even a 79-note tuning may require some compromises, as I found when<br/>&gt; trying to locate some medieval European progressions you mention<br/>&gt; below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From one perspective, a full 159-EDO might be ideal; from another, the<br/>&gt; artistry of a 79-tone qanun such as your wonderful innovation shows<br/>&gt; that the art of the intricate but possible is not to be disdained!<br/>&gt;</p><p>:)</p><p>&gt; With the regular 704.607-cent tuning, also, there are some real<br/>&gt; compromises even in covering a narrower ground: for example, the use<br/>&gt; of a single 132-cent size for both 14/13 and 13/12. Curiously, both<br/>&gt; this tuning and the 79-MOS involve some compromises here, although at<br/>&gt; some locations you have a virtually just 14:13 at 127-129 cents<br/>&gt; (varying minutely in size among these locations).</p><p>Surely, the happenstance actualization of 14:13 here and there cannot<br/>be construed as a positive aspect of 79MOS2deg159tET.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; In contrast, the 704.607-cent or &quot;e-based&quot; tuning is like a small<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and quiet garden with curious plants and flowers that may offer<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; some special colors and flavors. It is meant to be a charming<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; sample from the vast world of Maqam/Dastgah music -- but by no<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; means a complete or even representative one!  &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Despite all this modesty, I am inclined to admit that the 705 cent<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning produces much agreeable results from the perspective of maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is most welcome feedback. What I would love to do is to explore<br/>&gt; this system with some guidance on your part, for I relish our<br/>&gt; dialogues, and wonder if the process may possibly lead to any new<br/>&gt; insights or refinements as to maqam music in a kind of 24-note system<br/>&gt; which may not be of the most familiar type either for European music<br/>&gt; or for al-Musiqa al-Sharqiyya (&quot;Eastern Music&quot;) as it is often called<br/>&gt; in Arabic, I now know.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why not!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; A regular temperament with fifths tempered by about 2.65 cents<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; might be at about the maximum degree of impurity for 3:2 and 4:3<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; that I would be comfortable using when seeking something not too<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; far from a medieval European sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That is indeed about as much impurity one can tolerate in the<br/>&gt;&gt; building of maqam tetrachords and pentachords too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Happily, it seems to be just sufficient, when tempering in the wide<br/>&gt; direction, to obtain some reasonable septimal flavors from chains of<br/>&gt; 13, 14, or 15 generators for 9:7, 7:6, and 7:4.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That is swell.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; As someone whose musical formation and training focus largely on<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; medieval European music, I feel right at home. However, here it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; might not be out of place to quote the proverb of a 16th-century<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; English musician named Thomas Morley -- &quot;Such lips, such lettuce,&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; said while watching a donkey eating thistles!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; LOL! That is a cute proverb, but I feel it does grave injustice to<br/>&gt;&gt; your attire. Your tuning does indeed seem to reflect the musical<br/>&gt;&gt; spirit of Medieval Europe as well as house many maqam/dastgah<br/>&gt;&gt; flavours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now the challenge is for me to learn some of those flavors, with your<br/>&gt; fine examples of qanun music for inspiration.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are most kind. I am, however, quite the amateur in maqam music.<br/>What clarity I possess in tuning and theory comes from much cunning<br/>and shrewdness, yet little skill!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; In a setting where it is important either to represent the full<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; range<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; of Maqam/Dastgah colors, or to support music on a &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; footing in the usual sense of major/minor tonality, it is very easy<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to show why this tuning will fail, Ozan24 will succeed with the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; same number of notes per octave, and the 79-MOS on the qanun or<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; another instrument will, of course, succeed brilliantly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Very nicely stated. Conversely, Yarman24 and 79 MOS 2deg159-tET will<br/>&gt;&gt; surely fail in representing Medieval cadences that you have<br/>&gt;&gt; accentuated many times in our correspondences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I found, upon considering the 79-MOS closely, that indeed one<br/>&gt; will often need to use tempered rather than pure fourths and fifths in<br/>&gt; such cadences. This is one necessary compromise involved in making<br/>&gt; available the chains of tempered fifths required for the smooth<br/>&gt; management of maqam flavors and modulations.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very keenly described.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead of almost nothing being acknowledged as a middle or neutral<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; interval, we might slightly exaggerate by saying that almost<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; everything might seem to be a middle interval or to produce one,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; including the apotome of 132 cents, almost 6 commas, or not quite 9<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; yarmans (each equal to about 2/3 of a Holdrian comma, although the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; size of a yarman may minutely vary, like the secor, depending on<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the implementation of the 79-MOS).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; How nice of you to dub the 2/3 Holderian commas as a yarman unit,<br/>&gt;&gt; and how pleasing to see that you noticed the variation of its size<br/>&gt;&gt; depending on which approach one uses to derive 79 MOS 2deg159-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that is a great subtlety of the tuning, as when I noticed at one<br/>&gt; location an approximation of 14:13 at not quite 127 cents, and then<br/>&gt; used Scala to find that a range of sizes from 127-129 cents or so are<br/>&gt; present from different perdeler.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And your tuning does a splendid job too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The challenge is for me to learn to use it well.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hopefully you will succeed without further ado!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Appreciatively,<br/>Oz.</p></div>
