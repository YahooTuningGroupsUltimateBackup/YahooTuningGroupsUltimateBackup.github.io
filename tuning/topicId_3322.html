The<br/>music is really haunting.  The score is not bad although the string<br/>harmonization at the end seems a little questionable.</p><p>I love the forum and the way it&apos;s making me hear music so critically.<br/>One comment re &quot;serialism.&quot;  It is a compositional tool that has the<br/>ability of unifying the sound of a composition.  Its roots go back to<br/>the &quot;fugal&quot; form and it enables a composer to explore parts of a scale,<br/>especially a tempered scale, that might otherwise be ignored.</p><p>I&apos;ve been experimenting with Kiganda music from Uganda.  It uses an<br/>equi-pentatonic in such a way that melodies are composed to sound good<br/>in all five transpositions based on an octave ambitus for the melodies.<br/>Not that the music is played in all five transpositions or &quot;mikos&quot; but<br/>the melody is supposedly instantly recognizable.  The music is<br/>&quot;harmonized&quot; by a very rapid isorhythmic pattern, usually grouped in<br/>sixes, comprised of two interlocking patterns.  The interesting part is<br/>that the overall pattern can be fairly long and that the two<br/>interlocking patterns are often played by different individuals.</p><p>What I have found is that the pattern and its constant repetition, used<br/>as a foundation for a piece, evenly distributes the various pitches.<br/>Melodic permutations, as in &quot;fugue&quot; are the foundations of classical<br/>music composition.  Accompaniment by a pattern of pitches is similar to<br/>the &quot;row&quot; idea in serialism.</p><p>This consistency of pitch material was considered one of the most<br/>important prerequisites of good composition by Carter.  In other words,<br/>he hated octaves &amp; major thirds.  Banished the major triad.  And didn&apos;t<br/>like repeated notes.<br/>RT</p></div>
