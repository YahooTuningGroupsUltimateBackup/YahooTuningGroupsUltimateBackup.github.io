Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2002 11:35:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Dominique Larre, and thank you for raising a question in<br/>response to some recent comments of mine which is a most happy one:<br/>&quot;What is the basis for optimizing a tuning, or more generally a<br/>musical style or outlook?&quot;</p><p>While a group like tuning-math might be the ideal place to discuss the<br/>mathematical fine points of finding a precise &quot;ideal&quot; size of fifth<br/>for a given genre of temperament, for example, I consider the question<br/>of _why_ one prefers a given type of tuning for a given style very<br/>much a characteristic topic here. Of course, this is not to suggest<br/>that this kind of philosophical discussion would be out of place for a<br/>more specialized kind of forum either, only to say that &quot;optimization&quot;<br/>is a question which invites considering &quot;Why?&quot; as well as &quot;How?&quot;</p><p>For example, the meantone temperaments associated with the Renaissance<br/>music of 16th-century Europe seem nicely to fit the style: thirds with<br/>ratios at or near 5 (5:4, 6:5) fit with a smoothly flowing texture of<br/>mostly homogenous and saturated concords based on these ratios, while<br/>the rather wide diatonic semitones comport with the gentleness of the<br/>style. This isn&apos;t to say that there isn&apos;t an element of tension and<br/>contrast -- the suspension, especially, beautifully fulfilling this<br/>role -- but that the tuning system and style seem in harmony.</p><p>Of course, musicians and mathematicians can debate the precise degree<br/>of meantone temperament which ideally serves a given taste, for a<br/>specific piece: thus Mark Lindley prefers 1/4-comma (pure major thirds<br/>at 4:5) for some pieces, but 2/7-comma (major and minor thirds equally<br/>impure) for slower-moving Venetian organ pieces, and 1/5-comma (major<br/>thirds a bit larger than pure) for some English keyboard music around<br/>1600 where the narrower diatonic semitones or other nuances are more<br/>&quot;sprightly&quot; in effect.</p><p>A theorist might come up with some &quot;ideal&quot; meantone from the viewpoint<br/>of some mathematical function or formula -- and this has been done<br/>more than once -- but different people can have different preferences,<br/>now as in the 16th century, and listeners such as Lindley suggest that<br/>the &quot;optimal&quot; answer might be different for one piece than another.</p><p>With this prelude on a more familiar kind of tuning system, I&apos;ll try<br/>to share a few aesthetic considerations for what I call a &quot;common<br/>temperament&quot; (_participatio communis_) where fifths around about two<br/>cents wider than pure -- about the same amount of temperament as in<br/>12-tone equal temperament, but in the opposite direction.</p><p>At one level, the &quot;common music&quot; for which such a temperament is<br/>favored is largely based on a &quot;classical&quot; European background -- that<br/>is, the European tradition in the era from Perotin to Machaut, or<br/>about 1200-1400. From this viewpoint, the basic 12-note temperament on<br/>which a _participatio communis_ tuning is based can be seen as a<br/>somewhat accentuated form of medieval Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>At the same time, however, the aesthetic of this _common music_ also<br/>focuses on categories of intervals not discussed in the medieval<br/>European tradition, but recognized in medieval Near Eastern traditions<br/>and used in certain modern Near Eastern musics also. Some of these<br/>type of ratios and intervals, interestingly, also arise from the logic<br/>of experimentation in a European-type style with the new sizes of<br/>intervals made available by a 21st-century tuning with wide fifths.</p><p>One criterion is that the tuning should produce a regularly arranged<br/>and very attractive diatonic scale. With fifths of around 704 cents,<br/>for example, whole-tones are around 208 cents, about 4 cents larger<br/>than the Pythagorean 9:8 (~203.91 cents), while diatonic semitones are<br/>close to 22:21 (~80.54 cents). These semitones are rather more narrow<br/>and incisive than the 100-cent steps of 12-equal, or even the classic<br/>256:243 steps of medieval Pythagorean tuning (~90.22 cents).</p><p>At the same time, two other sizes of melodic steps often play a<br/>prominent role. Chromatic semitones at around 14:13 (~128.30 cents)<br/>add a contrasting &quot;color&quot; to the music; while in a usual &quot;common<br/>temperament&quot; of 24 notes, a small semitone or &quot;thirdtone&quot; often a bit<br/>smaller than 28:27 (~62.96 cents) is often used in cadences involving<br/>resolutions of intervals with ratios at or near 7.</p><p>In a 24-note system such as Peppermint 24, possibly the quintessential<br/>&quot;common temperament,&quot; there are other steps closely approximating<br/>medieval Near Eastern ratios such as 12:11 and 13:12, often described<br/>as neutral seconds. Here the &quot;variety of steps&quot; is deemed a musical<br/>virtue, with a special elegance resulting when the steps closely<br/>approach superparticular ratios (n+1:n).</p><p>While sonorities involving fifths and fourths mark the standard of<br/>stable concord and richness, as in 13th-14th century European music,<br/>unstable intervals such as thirds, sixths, major seconds, and minor<br/>sevenths are often used in &quot;relatively blending&quot; sonorities and<br/>textural passages, sometimes involving prolonged parallel motion with<br/>an eventual cadence to a stable sonority. The fauxbourdon of the early<br/>15th century provides a kind of model for some 21st-century forms of<br/>parallelism involving sonorities such as a tempered 7:9:12 or<br/>12:14:18:21.</p><p>Regular or usual diatonic ratios for major and minor thirds are<br/>generally around 14:11 (~417.51 cents) and 13:11 (~289.21 cents) or<br/>33:28 (~284.45 cents), and these usual ratios do much to set the tone<br/>and color for &quot;common music&quot; in such a temperament.</p><p>Augmented seconds at around 17:14 (~336.13 cents) and diminished<br/>fourths at around 21:17 (~365.83 cents) provide a contrasting color,<br/>with the &quot;Four Convivial Ratios&quot; (14:11, 13:11, 17:14, 21:17) serving<br/>both as especially esteemed ideals for the imperfect concords, and as<br/>friendly landmarks to describe a given fine degree of temperament. In<br/>Peppermint, all four ratios are within 1.5 cents of pure, a<br/>distinction giving it a special place on the musical map.</p><p>The regular major thirds around 14:11, and major sixths around 56:33<br/>or 22:13, are often praised as having a &quot;bright,&quot; &quot;active,&quot; or &quot;sunny&quot;<br/>quality, and as lending a certain &quot;buzz&quot; to directed cadential<br/>progressions. They are also beloved intervals for passages in<br/>conventional 15th-century fauxbourdon, where the observation by<br/>Johannes Boen (1357) about parallel thirds and sixths before a cadence<br/>is often cited: these pleasing intervals are like &quot;forerunners and<br/>handmaidens&quot; of the stable concords which typically follow.</p><p>In a 24-note system such as Peppermint, a related kind of effect but<br/>with a somewhat color is achieved by playing in parallel sonorities<br/>such as approximate 7:9:12 ratios (~0-435-933 cents in just<br/>intonation, and around 0-437-933 cents in Peppermint, with 7:12 pure<br/>but 7:9 about 2.14 cents wide, the same amount by which the fourth is<br/>narrow). These 7:9:12 sonorities are available on 10 of the 12 scale<br/>steps of the upper keyboard manual: one plays the lower note on the<br/>upper manual, and the notes visually a fourth and minor seventh higher<br/>on the lower manual.</p><p>While in a conventional late medieval European style or related genre<br/>of improvisation involves a variety of intervals, and even strict<br/>15th-century fauxbourdon with little ornamentation involves a routine<br/>contrast between major and minor types of thirds of sixths<br/>(e.g. A3-C4-F4 vs. G3-B3-E4, with C4 showing middle C), a texture of<br/>parallel 7:9:12 sonorities involves _literal_ parallelism, with all<br/>voices moving by identically-sized steps. The effect might recall both<br/>an organ mixture stop and some of the textures of Debussy at the turn<br/>of the 20th century.</p><p>Another Debussyian effect possible in Peppermint is the use of<br/>parallel sonorities with ratios near 11:14:18, with a usual 11:14<br/>major third and a large 7:9 major third forming an outer neutral sixth<br/>at 11:18. This feels to me very rich and &quot;different,&quot; with a floating<br/>quality that could suggest some sonorities of Debussy involving more<br/>notes. In &quot;common music&quot; there is often a preference for relatively<br/>mild timbres where complex ratios will have an effect or richness or<br/>subtlety rather than &quot;dissonance.&quot;</p><p>As already mentioned, a &quot;common temperament&quot; such as Peppermint<br/>includes many intervals characteristic of medieval or modern Near<br/>Eastern music, and this &quot;bicultural&quot; aspect of style further enriches<br/>the music. A Near Eastern scale might be used in a primarily melodic<br/>context, or as a source for vertical progressions introducing some<br/>curious variations on &quot;standard&quot; medieval European harmonies and<br/>cadences.</p><p>Having described some especially valued features of &quot;common music,&quot; I<br/>should add that a &quot;common temperament&quot; or _participatio communis_ is<br/>only one type of tuning system that might be used for realizing this<br/>kind of music. For example, a 17-note system, either equal, or<br/>well-tempered (as in George Secor&apos;s superb 17-note well-temperament),<br/>or based on integer ratios, could be used to play much of the music we<br/>are discussing very pleasantly.</p><p>There is also an awareness that a &quot;common temperament&quot; is indeed a<br/>_modern_ tuning, in contrast to the classic Pythagorean intonation of<br/>medieval Europe -- although the medieval Near East provides its own<br/>classic setting for many of the interval types and sizes which<br/>result.</p><p>A final &quot;optimization&quot; feature might bear mentioning: in a tuning<br/>system like Peppermint, while each keyboard is arranged in a standard<br/>diatonic fashion, transposing or mixing notes from the two keyboards<br/>makes possible many small nuances and distinctions between step sizes<br/>and modes. Although a fixed-pitch instrument like a keyboard cannot<br/>fully achieve the flexibility of ensemble performers either as<br/>suggested by the medieval European theory of Marchettus of Padua<br/>(1318) or reported for Near Eastern performances of _maqaam_ music,<br/>the variety of step sizes and intervals at least makes it possible to<br/>approximate some of these distinctions.</p><p>Here I have attempted to suggest some general aspects of<br/>&quot;optimization&quot; -- tastes and preferences as to the best sizes for<br/>intervals such as major and minor thirds in a given style -- along<br/>with considerations such as variety of step sizes. I&apos;ve picked a<br/>rather conventionalized, although possibly not so widely familiar,<br/>kind of 21st-century tuning to illustrate some of these points.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=41330 href="#41330">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2002 2:20:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
