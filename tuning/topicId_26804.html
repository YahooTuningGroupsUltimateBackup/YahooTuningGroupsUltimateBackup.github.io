That is hard, as the notes of<br/>a chord are not played exactly simultaneously, and it is hard<br/>for a program to guess in advance what the remaining notes are.</p><p>Pure ratio scales can be fun to explore&apos; limited number of<br/>chords that are pure, but you learn where they are, and<br/>interesting to develop music with that &quot;universe&quot;. The hexanies<br/>and other lattice scales can have large numbers of pure chords<br/>and can be quite fascinating, though hard to navigate for<br/>composing or improvisation on first encounter I find. Well<br/>worthwhile getting to know one of those and writing something in<br/>it.</p><p>For adaptive tuning, John deLaubenfels explores leisure retuning,<br/>where one does a complete performance, and his program goes<br/>through the whole thing and retunes it all. That sidesteps the<br/>problem of not being able to anticipate the notes before they<br/>are played.</p><p>Other approach is to have a way that one can specify oneself<br/>what the root of the chord is. This is prob. quite easy,<br/>e.g. with a separate manual, and you press appropriate key<br/>for the root in it.</p><p>We are actually discussing all this over in crazy-music at present.</p><p>I&apos;m author of fractal tune smithy which can be used for midi relaying.</p><p>See the &quot;compositinal methods&quot; thread, e.g. my post:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/974">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/974</a></p><p>part of a long thread with Carl Lumma and I discussing these ideas,<br/>before and after that, and see if any is of interest to you.</p><p>Also earlier, been discussing adaptive tuning ideas with JdL.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in extending the midi relaying capabilities of FTS.</p><p>Maybe you&apos;d like to join the discussion.</p><p>crazy_music and makemicromusic are the groups really focussed on<br/>how to actual make music for all the lattices and scales etc<br/>discussed on the tuning group.</p><p>Just a first impression, getting a program to guess what notes<br/>are likely to be played next is probably hard, if that is needed<br/>- it is the sort of general area where computers are not so good<br/>at as humans. But there are powerful techniques around in computing<br/>that can make some progress even with intractable seeming problems like<br/>this. Viz improvements in speech recognition, automatic translation<br/>of languages etc. Okay automatic translations are not perfect, but<br/>pretty amazing when one considers the computer has no knowledge of what any of<br/>the words actually &quot;mean&quot; - couldn&apos;t point to any real world object<br/>and says &quot;this is a ...&quot;. In the same way, the midi retuning software<br/>doesn&apos;t actually &quot;understand&quot; any of the music it is retuning, and<br/>if that is what is required, it will be well out of its depth. But<br/>some progress is possible and the number of mistakes it makes could<br/>be reduced.</p><p>Only other things one could try are, to just allow glitches where<br/>notes get retuned after they are first played, sliding up or down<br/>in pitch, or to introduce a delay of say half a second between<br/>playing a note and actually hearing it, to give program a chance<br/>to identify all the notes of a chord and retune them accordingly.<br/>One could prob. learn to play with such a delay, as it is<br/>similar to non electrically controlled acoustic organs.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
