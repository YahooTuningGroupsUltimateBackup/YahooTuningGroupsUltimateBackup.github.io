Like all advertising, it consumes, digests and<br/>regurgitates everything in its path, even to the point of selling a<br/>peoples own &quot;kulcha&quot; back to them in order to turn it into a<br/>profitable commodity item. It also promotes a particularly insidious<br/>form of arrogance which clothes itself as &quot;open mindedness&quot; so that<br/>all criticism can be automatically disarmed by being branded<br/>as &quot;closed minded&quot;. Teenagers, those perpetual followers, are<br/>particularly prone to this &quot;argument&quot;. It can also be described as<br/>(what I have nick-named) creative megalomania, the attempt of lazy<br/>music students to get out of study and practice by claiming that they<br/>are seeing the &quot;bigger musical picture&quot;. (Needless to say we can only<br/>improve on something by building on its strengths). Ironically, I<br/>find that older western music which, even in its occasional snobbery,<br/>ends-up being more the respectfull because it keeps to itself and<br/>doesn&apos;t museumify tribal cultures by &quot;trying to understand them&quot;.<br/>(eg: here in Australia we have aboriginals playing didgeridoo to a<br/>techno track, in complete disregard for its traditional religeous<br/>function).</p><p>Rick</p></div>
