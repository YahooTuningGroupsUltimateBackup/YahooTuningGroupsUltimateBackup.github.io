Since its C major frequency ratios are 1, 5/4, 3/2, it is expected that the plot will show an asthetic and periodic response which are signs of optimal harmony as happens with the thre Piagui responses.</p><p>Should the JI C major plot is an aesthetic and periodic response this result would confirm that the procedure I apply to get the chord wave peaks reveals the harmony degree of the plotted chord.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>February 05<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>From Carl:</p><p>Steve wrote:</p><p>&gt; * distances crop up in two places - the Gaussian function &quot;height&quot;<br/>&gt; depends on the distance between the actual chord and the candidate<br/>&gt; JI chord; and this function needs to be integrated over an area<br/>&gt; &quot;belonging&quot; to the candidate JI chord.</p><p>It&apos;s the former I think I got wrong.  The latter is resolved<br/>because we estimate this integral by multiplying the &apos;height&apos;<br/>of the Gaussian at the location of the candidate by the inverse<br/>geomean of the candidate&apos;s identities (which approximates the<br/>area &apos;belonging&apos; to it).</p><p>&gt; * initially I thought it was going to be essential to &quot;plot&quot;<br/>&gt; the points in this space in order to determine the neighbours<br/>&gt; and hence the Voronoi cells correctly; however, with the area<br/>&gt; approximation given by Carl, there is no need to do this.</p><p>Right.  However it is still a good plot to view the results,<br/>e.g. in a heat map or 3-D landscape plot.</p><p>&gt; * therefore, I simply express the distance in terms of the<br/>&gt; x and y differences - in effect, use x^2 + y^2 + (x+y)^2 in<br/>&gt; the Gaussian.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How does this sound?</p><p>I will have to review The Geometry of Triangular Plots<br/>myself... how did you get the (x+y)^2 term?</p><p>-Carl</p><p>__________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 5506 (20101005) __________</p><p>ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p><a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=93547 href="#93547">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2010 5:32:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mario wrote:</p><p>&gt; In my opinion,<br/>&gt; It is almost incredible that two chords can be analyzed through<br/>&gt; such mathematical tools, instead I always thought that optimal<br/>&gt; chords are formed by simple rules dictated by nature so should<br/>&gt; these procedures bring us to undeniable and useful conclusions,<br/>&gt; Carl Lumma and Steve Martin would have done a remarkable work.</p><p>Thanks, Mario.
