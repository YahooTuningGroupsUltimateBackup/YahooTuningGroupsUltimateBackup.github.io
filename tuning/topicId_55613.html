Haresh, many musicians incorporate all sorts of<br/>harmonics, including the 7th harmonic, in their work. It all depends<br/>on how far up the harmonic series one wants to incorporate its<br/>factors into a tuning--hence the term &apos;limit&apos;. &apos;5 limit JI&apos; stops at<br/>the fifth harmonic, the one we recognize as a major third, etc.</p><p>BTW, using the term &apos;14th harmonic&apos; is redundant when talking about<br/>octave reducing tunings--it&apos;s the same as the 7th harmonic, but one<br/>octave higher. Only the prime factors give us new subjective<br/>affects, but for example the 9th harmonic, being the P5th of a P5th,<br/>is often latticed as being a colorful factor in its own right.</p><p>Also Haresh, JI genrally only considers notes that are part of the<br/>overtonal or undertonal series, i.e. naturally occurring pitches of<br/>a harmonic timbre, plus their mirror fractional inversions.</p><p>As for the word &apos;natural&apos;, be careful--there are plenty of<br/>&apos;naturally occuring sounds&apos; whose spectra are *far* from being<br/>harmonic. In fact more sounds than not are inharmonic.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2004 1:27:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello ALL, Can you please show me the aesthetics (or, logic) behind<br/>the  7th partial ( b-sesquiflat) having been  most unceremoniously<br/>shoved off into oblivion in connection with JI ?</p><p>I don&apos;t see that this is true, but in any case sometimes they only<br/>appear to be gone. If you take the 22 srutis of the scale Scala calls<br/>&quot;indian.scl&quot;, you see listed a 5-limit scale. However, ask Scala to<br/>list all utonal tetrads--chords of the form 1-5/4-3/2-7/4--and it<br/>lists seven of them. It also gives errors of 32805/32768, 225/224, or<br/>the ratio of these, 5120/5103. The error could be distributed by<br/>tempering out 32805/32768 and 225/224, the &quot;garibaldi&quot; temperament.<br/>You could do this by for instance tuning everything to 94-equal, which<br/>has what I call a &quot;copoptimal fifth&quot; (optimum in a certain sense in<br/>both the 7 and 9 odd limits.)</p><p>It would not be surprising if, when you took your favorite 5-limit<br/>scale from Indian music theory and analyzed it in Scala, you found<br/>7-limit implications.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2004 1:39:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Haresh, Jim, and Aaron,</p><p>Haresh:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jim Cole&quot; &lt;thejimcole@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello ALL, Can you please show me the aesthetics<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (or, logic) behind the 7th partial (b-sesquiflat)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; having been  most unceremoniously shoved off into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; oblivion in connection with JI ?
