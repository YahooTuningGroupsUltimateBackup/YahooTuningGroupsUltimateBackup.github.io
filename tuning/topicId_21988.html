His critique of every art other than Bach&apos;s was<br/>harshly derogatory, yet he did no seem to have a truly critical<br/>judgment himselfÂ…&quot;</p><p>&quot;He assumes quite as a matter of course that the Bach style is the<br/>only right one; if the earlier theorists do not agree with this style<br/>then their teaching has thereby condemned itself.  On the other hand,<br/>Kirnberger writes concerning his great teacher:</p><p>&apos;Johann Sebastian Bach uses a thoroughly pure style in all his<br/>compositions; every work of his has a definite unified character.<br/>Rhythm, melody, harmony, in short, all that makes a composition<br/>really beautiful, he has completely at his command as is attested by<br/>his works.  His method is the best, for he makes the transition from<br/>the easiest to the most difficult step by step in a thorough manner,<br/>and for this very reason the step to the fugue itself is no more<br/>difficult than any of the other steps on the way.  For this reason I<br/>consider THE METHOD OF JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH THE ONE AND ONLY METHOD.<br/>[ed.  emphasis Kirnberger&apos;s]&apos;&quot;</p><p>Curiously, unlike Fux, Kirnberger begins in the opposite direction --<br/>with four part harmony -- and urges students to attempt writing in<br/>two or three parts only they have FIRST mastered the 4-part<br/>exercises.  This is, of course, due to the fact that, by this time<br/>HARMONY was taking a certain predominance to melody.  As we recall,<br/>Margo Schulter has carefully delimited this transition for us in<br/>previous posts on counterpoint and interval usage, as well as the<br/>tunings used in the various periods and the changes brought about by<br/>the predominance of certain intervals and chords, as well as the<br/>different practice.</p><p>As Kirnberger states (again from Jeppesen)  NOTE THIS ONE:</p><p>&quot;&apos;Simple strict counterpoint can be in two, three, four, or more<br/>parts.  It is best to begin with four-part counterpoint because it is<br/>hardly possible to write in two or three parts perfectly until four-<br/>part writing has been mastered.  For since the complete harmony is in<br/>four parts, something must always be missing in two- and three- part<br/>works, so that one cannot judge safely as to what is to be omitted<br/>from the harmony in the different cases which arise unless he has a<br/>thorough knowledge of four-part writingÂ…&apos;&quot;</p><p>As we can see, there are no &quot;trines&quot; for Kirnberger and no &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>fifths!  Everything is part of a 5-limit chord, that is<br/>somehow &quot;incomplete&quot; or even &quot;defective&quot; without the missing &quot;link!&quot;</p><p>Finally, and this is the humorous part, Kirnberger urges students to<br/>take great care in studying and playing Bach, since, despite Bach&apos;s<br/>basic chordal viewpoint, Bach uses linear elements so strongly and<br/>independently that they become &quot;harsh&quot; or &quot;confusing&quot; since they can<br/>only be interpreted through the logic of the voice leading.</p><p>Kirnberger was obviously contrapuntally &quot;outclassed&quot; by his own<br/>master!</p><p>________ ______ _ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
