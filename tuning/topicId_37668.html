And that&apos;s about 20 minutes testing and fine tuning on each<br/>&gt;string  at room temperature. The tubes, every time I check, are accurate,<br/>&gt;no problem with the fundamental, as I have eliminated partial<br/>&gt;interference using filters. Maybe you could add these to your list or,<br/>&gt;if my tuner&apos;s wrong, I could sue Peterson under the UK Trades<br/>&gt;Description Act.</p><p>Alison, I meant &quot;classical&quot;, say those in mass production.  With custom<br/>instruments, the sky&apos;s the limit.  I was just trying to establish how<br/>rare such accuracy is.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using Peterson strobe tuners for years.  My original unit was<br/>stolen, so now I&apos;ve got one of the digitally-controlled ones with the<br/>claimed 0.1-cent accuracy.  I believe this is just the accuracy at which<br/>they&apos;ve got the strobe and motor working together.  It&apos;s still up to the tuner to be able to see the wheel and tune the instrument correctly.  For<br/>timbres that have strong, perfectly-harmonic even-numbered partials,<br/>getting 0.1 cents out of it may be possible.  Not with a piano though,<br/>but I&apos;ve know piano tuners that I suspect are tuning that finely by ear.</p><p>I am interested in your instruments -- in particular, what do you mean<br/>by using filters on tubes?  What sort of tubes?  Struck with a hammer?<br/>I&apos;ve heard of using hose clamps to kill certain partials on struck<br/>tubes...</p><p>I&apos;m a long-time advocate of JI.  I too would be surprised if there&apos;s a<br/>useful microtemperament for the 19-limit in 21 tones or so.  Maybe Gene<br/>can prove me wrong.</p><p>I&apos;ve also built a custom instrument -- a 15-limit slide guitar.  I tune<br/>it with my strobe tuner, to about 1-cent accuracy between strings, I<br/>think, though it doesn&apos;t last very long.  The slide is only good to about<br/>10 cents or so, but that&apos;s melodic resolution, and plenty good enough.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>PS- the strings on my slide guitar are fastened with nickel-plated<br/>zither pins.</p></div><h3><a id=37700 href="#37700">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2002 10:08:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am interested in your instruments -- in particular, what do you mean<br/>&gt; by using filters on tubes?

I have a Digitech rack unit with a good set of filters, low-, high-, band-, etc. If I want to get a good fundamental I<br/>experiment with the steel tubes, 1/2&quot; or 3/4&quot;, through the filters till I get an unwavering signal. Then I can cut and file as appropriate. After 100<br/>plus tubes you get good at it. Kris Peck suggested this a few months ago and it works very well. Also you&apos;re right, pressing on certain points of the<br/>tubes and trying different beaters will all give different partials at different amplitudes.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m a long-time advocate of JI.
