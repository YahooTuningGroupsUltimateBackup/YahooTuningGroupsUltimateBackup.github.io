(I joined the rebec class which was a lot<br/>of fun, with beginner&apos;s trying to play the gamelan scales<br/>on a string instrument.)</p><p>Probably still doing gamelan events.</p><p>So that is a microtonal connection, though I don&apos;t think<br/>it is theoretical, more practically orientated. When I played<br/>anyway, anyone could join, and in fact they encouraged those<br/>with little in the way of musical training as they thought<br/>that made it somewhat easier to learn the gamelan rhythms,<br/>which aren&apos;t quite in the same mould as the ones used in<br/>classical music. No auditions, you just turn up for the<br/>evening, and get assigned an instrument, with the slower<br/>moving ones and the gongs assigned to beginners. Much the<br/>same way the gamelan is played in Indonesia I imagine.</p><p>They also have a nice collection of recorders on display<br/>in the museum, and it is a working museum - music students<br/>can borrow the instruments from the collection and play them.</p><p>So, perhaps suitable for some future venue; maybe not for<br/>the first time.</p><p>Can&apos;t be much in the way of microtonal research as<br/>the Bodelean doesn&apos;t even have Harry Partch&apos;s<br/>&quot;Genesis of a music&quot; (nor can the music faculty have it<br/>as it would show up in the same catalogue)!</p><p>I&apos;ll look forward to your presentations, supposing this<br/>gets underway! Haven&apos;t really been following what&apos;s<br/>happening in the Miracle thread yet - too much information<br/>to take in all at once, when also in the middle of<br/>programming things and following up various ideas.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
