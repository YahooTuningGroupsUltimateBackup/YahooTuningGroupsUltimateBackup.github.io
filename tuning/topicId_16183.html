In reply to his<br/>article, I would like to propose a new category of &quot;rational<br/>intonation&quot; (RI) for Gothic/neo-Gothic tuning systems based<br/>exclusively on integer ratios, but not on the kind of &quot;harmonically<br/>based&quot; intonation which Dave ably argues is a basic feature of &quot;just<br/>intonation&quot; (JI).</p><p>In the first section of this response, I consider the interesting<br/>conclusion that &quot;JI&quot; may be an anachronistic term when used to<br/>describe Gothic or neo-Gothic music in rational tunings indeed based<br/>on integer ratios both simple and complex, but not based on a<br/>systematic use of or preference for the harmonic or subharmonic<br/>series.</p><p>If great theorists such as Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325) or Prosdocimus<br/>(1413) could get along very nicely without, to my knowledge, invoking<br/>a term such as &quot;just intonation,&quot; maybe I would do best to follow<br/>their example and avoid a Renaissance and later term which may invite<br/>spurious associations. To distinguish Gothic and neo-Gothic tunings<br/>based exclusively on integer ratios from neo-Gothic temperaments, the<br/>term RI serves nicely while avoiding such associations.</p><p>In the second section, I briefly consider an interesting possible<br/>ramification of Dave&apos;s approach: that some musics may be _both_ just<br/>and tempered (e.g. a composition in a temperament with relevant<br/>intervals within 0.5 cents of pure); and others may be _neither_ just<br/>nor tempered (e.g. Gothic and neo-Gothic pieces in rational intonation<br/>systems not &quot;harmonically based&quot;).</p><p>There I propose the term &quot;nuancing&quot; to describe the neo-Gothic concept<br/>of a continuum of ratios, RI or irrational, as opposed to either the<br/>harmonic-series-based outlook of JI or the calculated compromising of<br/>pure intervals involved in temperament.</p><p>Much of what follows might best be read in connection with my series<br/>of articles offering &quot;A Gentle Introduction to neo-Gothic<br/>Progressions,&quot; where such relevant concepts as sonorities, cadences,<br/>and intonational flavors are presented at length.</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15038">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15038</a>  (1/Pt 1)<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15630">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15630</a>  (1/Pt 2A)<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15685">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15685</a>  (1/Pt 2B)<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134</a>  (1/Pt 2C)</p><p>Please let me add that this process of dialogue has persuaded me to<br/>describe a new (to me) integer-based tuning system I shall soon be<br/>posting about as RI rather than &quot;JI.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s very exciting to be involved with such tunings and discovering<br/>(or rediscovering) all kinds of delightful surprises, and the idea of<br/>a new (or at least less familiar) category of rational tunings adds to<br/>the excitement of this process.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Gothic/neo-Gothic &quot;JI&quot;: An infelicitous anachronism?<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Dave, the 1811 definition of just intonaton you have quoted both<br/>publicly and in our e-mail messages seems an ideal expression of your<br/>sense of &quot;JI&quot; as a system based on &quot;harmonic tuning.&quot;</p><p>From my point of view, definitions dating to 1211 or 1411 might be more<br/>relevant to my own musical approach, and this brings us to an interesting<br/>and possibly humorous quirk of this whole dialogue which maybe leads to a<br/>curious conclusion.</p><p>The term &quot;JI&quot; might arguably be more of an anachronism than a historically<br/>appropriate term when applied either to medieval European music or to my<br/>neo-Gothic endeavors involving systems using integer ratios (or the<br/>closest approximations I can get in practice).</p><p>The problem is that JI may be too _modern_ a concept to apply very well to<br/>music not based systematically on the harmonic series. Both 13th-14th<br/>century theorists and I agree that 32:27 is a regular and relatively<br/>concordant (although unstable) interval, actually somewhat more concordant<br/>as a bare interval than the simpler 9:8 -- without any consideration of<br/>such things as the 27th and 32nd harmonics, which I would consider quite<br/>irrelevant in this connection.</p><p>The intonational world of 1811 -- or 1529 or 1558, for that matter (the<br/>5-limit systems of Fogliano and Zarlino, which we would agree _are_ JI) --<br/>has very different musical assumptions than the world of 1211 or 1311 or<br/>1411 which is a starting point for my own Gothic/neo-Gothic integer-based<br/>endeavors (and endeavors involving temperaments also).</p><p>This raises an interesting question: does the term &quot;just intonation&quot; get<br/>used by medieval theorists at all? If not, might not I do better just<br/>using integer ratios and leaving &quot;JI&quot; to people involved with styles where<br/>&quot;lower integer ratios&quot; and &quot;harmonically based music&quot; are fitting<br/>concepts?</p><p>Please let me add that I do consider barbershop singing as JI, because it<br/>is based on pure integer ratios or very close approximations -- low<br/>integer ratios and harmonically locking intervals are synonymous for the<br/>applicable timbres. Just as it is impossible to draw a line with zero<br/>thickness, so realized JI will involve some variance from precise integer<br/>ratios -- but the idea of integer ratios doesn&apos;t seem inconsistent to me<br/>with such necessary variances, nor to require that singers tuning pure<br/>intervals know the mathematical ratios involved.</p><p>However, I might add, your example of barbershop singing is more than<br/>an ingenious (and eloquently argued) debating point. The issue is not<br/>merely whether and how we should address numbers and sounds, but<br/>exactly what those numbers stand for. To you, 4:7 is evidently not so<br/>much an integer ratio as a beatless locking of partials 4 and 7. To<br/>me, 7:4 is an integer ratio like 16:9 representing one possible nuance<br/>upon the general theme of a minor seventh inviting contraction to a<br/>stable fifth by stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>As the numbers get higher, the difference between our conceptions (if<br/>I interpret yours correctly) becomes more and more obvious. To me,<br/>32:27 or 13:11 or 27:23 is a possible nuance for a minor third which<br/>might cadentially contract to a unison. To you, I suspect, describing<br/>these ratios as &quot;JI&quot; would imply relations between _locking-in<br/>partials_ of 27:32, 11:13, or 23:27 -- something I do not mean to<br/>imply, and evidently foreign to medieval European theory also.</p><p>Please let me also add that I regard the Hammond organ as a rational<br/>intonation system in a purely formal sense, not a characteristic or<br/>exemplary one. Really, my main point is just that I&apos;m inclined to be<br/>inclusive, but to recognize that some cases are quite formal or<br/>marginal, rather than to take the risk of excluding something that<br/>maybe I&apos;d want to include.</p><p>From your point of view, however, I suspect that the absurdity of such<br/>an instrument as &quot;JI&quot; goes beyond the use of rational ratios to<br/>emulate tempered ones (or sometimes possibly vice-versa). For example,<br/>in a neo-Gothic style, a pure (i.e. exact) 14:11 is almost identical<br/>to 16/46 octave, and likewise a 127:100 to 10/29 octave. In either RI<br/>or tempered (i.e. irrational) form, these ratios and intervals are<br/>cherished for their intriguing complexity, not as incidental offshoots<br/>of simpler ratios but as regular and basic forms in their own right.</p><p>The point is that the Hammond has no pure or &quot;harmonically based&quot;<br/>intervals other than the octave. From an RI perspective with its<br/>nuanced gradations on a dense rational number line, this is merely a<br/>curious marginal case; from your JI perspective, it is additionally a<br/>grating musical anomaly.</p><p>Anyway, to state my own musical perspective positively, I tend to view<br/>RI as following and further developing an older approach to integer<br/>ratios not based on the harmonic series as a basic criterion, an<br/>approach embracing the continuum of intervals seen as a rational<br/>rather than real number line. Actually I suspect that the RI and<br/>tempered neo-Gothic systems I most commonly use in practice are quite<br/>similar -- more similar to each other than either is to &quot;JI.&quot;<br/>Specifically, I find that I lean very strongly in practice toward<br/>regular or virtually regular tunings, either RI (i.e. Pythagorean) or<br/>tempered (e.g. 29-tET, Noble Fifth, e-based, etc.).</p><p>Why do I approach things in this way? Because it seems to fit the music I<br/>am drawn to in theory and practice. Were I drawn to 16th-19th century JI<br/>as a main priority, your definition might very nicely fit my focus.</p><p>Anyway, to answer your question as to motivation, I follow the &quot;tuning<br/>by integer ratios&quot; concept because it seems to fit my own medieval<br/>musical roots and tradition, and also the music I&apos;m actually<br/>producing. From your viewpoint, of course, much of what I do might be<br/>described simply as using rational ratios to come up with various<br/>kinds of tempered intervals -- or better, &quot;non-harmonically-based&quot;<br/>or &quot;nuanced&quot; ones.</p><p>Maybe something like &quot;rational continuum intonation&quot; (RCI) might<br/>describe my own viewpoint. One sign of this might be that when Joe<br/>Monzo was discussing 75:64, my immediate reaction was nothing to do<br/>with 5-limit ratios -- it was, &quot;this is an interesting place on the<br/>continuum between 32:27 and 7:6, sort of moving toward the outskirts<br/>of the 7:6 valley, and 75:64 is very close to 5/22 octave, the regular<br/>minor third of 22-tET.&quot;</p><p>Up to now, my implicit reasoning has been rather like the following:</p><p>1. Gothic/neo-Gothic integer-based tunings are indeed based on integers.<br/>2. JI tunings are based on integer ratios (or especially &quot;valley&quot; ones).<br/>3. Therefore Gothic/neo-Gothic integer-based tunings are a form of &quot;JI.&quot;</p><p>However, if the &quot;harmonically-based&quot; concept of JI is the correct or<br/>generally accepted one, then I might wisely abandon the use of the<br/>term and invent a new one -- as I have done with &quot;Rational Intonation&quot;<br/>or RI.</p><p>To me, either 9:8 or 32:27 is a primary rational ratio; the dichotomy<br/>harmonically-based/not-harmonically-based doesn&apos;t, for me, fit with a<br/>Pythagorean tuning system, because both of these intervals are somewhat<br/>compatible but neither is stable, and in fact I agree with medieval<br/>theorists (and composers in practice) that the bare 32:27 is somewhat<br/>_more_ concordant than the bare 9:8.</p><p>Note that 32:27 is some distance from any &quot;valley,&quot; if I&apos;m correct -- an<br/>81:80 from 6:5, and a 64:63 from 7:6. Yet I regard it as basic and<br/>relatively concordant, although unstable -- the idea of a distinction<br/>between &quot;harmonically-based&quot; and &quot;other&quot; intervals is something that seems<br/>foreign to me in medieval or neo-medieval theory. If this is what JI<br/>implies, then the term might well be avoided for this music.</p><p>We would agree that most traditional &quot;JI&quot; (and RI) systems include<br/>_some_ valley ratios: I would be unlikely to describe any Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic RI system that didn&apos;t include a pure 3:2 and 4:3. However,<br/>a pure 2:3:4 or 6:8:9, etc., doesn&apos;t imply a systematic &quot;harmonically<br/>based&quot; outlook; and I would say that 54:64:81 or 14:17:21 expresses my<br/>outlook on RI just as much as such simple ratios. Indeed the contrast<br/>between simplicity and complexity is a large part of the point, as we<br/>discussed in our joint paper on Noble Mediants of complexity.</p><p>In short, I am open to an argument which might be consistent with both of<br/>our musical approaches: that simply because I am using integer ratios,<br/>this does not necessarily mean that I am following the rather _modern_<br/>concept of JI.</p><p>Trying to outline a possible case for this viewpoint, I might argue that<br/>indeed &quot;the Just scale&quot; by default refers to the 5-limit scale of Fogliano<br/>or Zarlino, and marks a point where (as you pointed out on the List) the<br/>_senario_ (1,2,3,4,5,6) becomes a basis for vertical textures generally,<br/>even if the harmonic series itself is still to be discovered in the early<br/>17th century.</p><p>A concept where 3:2, 9:8, and 32:27 or 27:16 all represent a spectrum of<br/>intervals not divided into &quot;harmonically-based/not-harmonically-based&quot; --<br/>although they certainly have differing degrees of concord -- is maybe best<br/>not confused with JI in this historical sense, especially since I am<br/>unaware of any medieval theorist calling it &quot;JI.&quot;</p><p>In other words, such an argument might conclude that my concepts follow my<br/>historical roots in practice and theory, but that the label of &quot;JI&quot; with<br/>its harmonic-based implications is an anachronism which may mainly<br/>confuse, rather like trying to use Rameau&apos;s terminology to describe<br/>14th-century vertical technique. Carl Dahlhaus wrote a book about the<br/>misconceptions which can result from such dubious use of language, and<br/>as an advocate of Gothic and neo-Gothic tunings and music, I have<br/>every reason to favor definitional clarity rather than confusion.</p><p>We all have our own theoretical approaches, and maybe RI is as good a<br/>term as any for mine. A very enjoyable offshoot of the 75:64 discussion<br/>for me was determining that this ratio represents a weighted intermediate<br/>between 6:5 and 7:6 where y/x=9/2:</p><p>                   (7*9 + 6*2)   (63 + 12)   75<br/>                   ----------- = --------- = --<br/>                   (6*9 + 5*2)   (54 + 10)   64</p><p>Maybe a lot of my approach might be called not so much tuning by<br/>integer ratios as _nuancing_ by integer ratios -- and we certainly<br/>agree that either the rational or real number line has the property of<br/>density.[1]</p><p>Given the nature of my approach, maybe I should recuse myself from<br/>further attempts to define JI, focusing on defining RI as a distinct<br/>approach differing from either JI or temperaments involving irrational<br/>numbers, although in some ways resembling either (pure valley ratios<br/>plus lots of complex and finely nuanced ones).</p><p>Anyway, that 1811 quote really made a point for me: if this definition<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to fit my concept which I&apos;ve been calling &quot;JI,&quot; then maybe I<br/>should find a quote from 1211 or 1311 or 1411 which might -- but can I<br/>find _any_ definition of &quot;just intonation&quot; from this era? If not, maybe<br/>it&apos;s an extraneous concept which I shouldn&apos;t borrow just for the sake of<br/>familiarity or popularity at the expense of clear communication.</p><p>A special advantage of avoiding the whole &quot;JI&quot; area of terminology is<br/>minimizing the risk that someone might confuse neo-Gothic RI with JI<br/>aesthetics which _are_ harmonically based. In other words, I might do<br/>well to avoid approaching a position where I appear to be proposing<br/>definitions based on 13th-14th century or derivative music for<br/>application also to &quot;JI&quot; music in 19th-century style, say -- as<br/>unfortunate as the opposite situation, with which I am all too<br/>familiar.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>2. Just and/or tempered -- or both, or neither?<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>From your JI perspective based on a locking-in of partials, you raise<br/>the interesting possibility that a tempered tuning may nevertheless<br/>achieve this &quot;locking-in&quot; for the relevant set of just intervals in a<br/>given context, and therefore be both &quot;just&quot; and &quot;tempered.&quot;</p><p>For example, if 1:2 octaves and 2:3 fifths were the only relevant pure<br/>ratios (note that I follow your ascending order of terms, to suggest<br/>relations between partials), and we adopt your proposal of an<br/>acceptable variance of 0.5 cents for a &quot;just&quot; interval, then 41-tET<br/>(fifth 24/41 octave, ~702.44 cents, ~0.48 cents wide) would be a just<br/>_and_ tempered tuning, or indeed a &quot;just temperament.&quot; As you noted,<br/>53-tET would be a yet more accurate example (fifth 31/53 octave,<br/>~701.89 cents, ~0.07 cents narrow).</p><p>If we are considering 5-limit JI, then as you pointed out, 118-tET<br/>(fifth 69/118 octave, ~701.69 cents, ~0.26 cents narrow; major third<br/>38/118 octave, ~386.44 cents, ~0.13 cents wide) would be a just<br/>temperament.</p><p>In contrast, I might argue that with a Pythagorean tuning used in a<br/>Gothic or neo-Gothic context where something like 64:81:96, for<br/>example, is considered as relatively blending or &quot;concordant&quot; although<br/>unstable, we have neither a &quot;just&quot; (harmonically based) nor a<br/>&quot;tempered&quot; (irrational or deliberately compromised) tuning, but a<br/>_nuanced_ rational intonation (RI).</p><p>The same conclusion may apply to neo-Gothic RI systems featuring pure<br/>3:2 fifths and 14:11 major thirds and 33:28 minor thirds -- these<br/>thirds are neither harmonically-based nor tempered, but &quot;nuanced&quot;<br/>using integer ratios. A neo-Gothic 28:33:42 is a point on a continuum<br/>of flavors which might be seen as variations on the traditional<br/>Pythagorean 54:64:81 -- the basic theme is an unstable sonority where<br/>the lower minor third invites contraction to a unison, for example,<br/>while the upper major third invites expansion to a fifth.</p><p>Similarly, either 54:64:81:96 or 12:14:18:21 is a possible nuance or<br/>intonational variation on the basic theme of a sonority, unstable but<br/>&quot;compatible,&quot; with an outer minor seventh inviting contraction to a<br/>stable fifth. The former is the &quot;classic Gothic&quot; flavor of Pythagorean<br/>tuning, while the latter is a more &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;streamlined&quot; variant;<br/>but they are considered equally &quot;in tune,&quot; representing fine gradients<br/>sharing a similar position on the continuum of concord/discord. To<br/>borrow a term from Jacobus of Liege which he uses to describe the<br/>16:9, either form of minor seventh sonority might be called an<br/>&quot;imperfect concord,&quot; appreciably tense but with some degree of blend<br/>also.</p><p>To conclude, I might remark that I have adopted the term &quot;JI&quot; for my<br/>integer-based Gothic and neo-Gothic efforts largely by inertia: &quot;Since<br/>this tuning doesn&apos;t have any irrational ratios, and has pure trines at<br/>2:3:4, it seems to fit in the &apos;just&apos; category.&quot;</p><p>However, maybe the categories &quot;just&quot; and &quot;tempered&quot; weren&apos;t designed<br/>mainly with Gothic/neo-Gothic music in mind. Why not a new concept of<br/>&quot;nuanced intervals,&quot; rational (RI) or irrational (neo-Gothic<br/>temperaments), which better fits the continuum of intonational flavors<br/>I&apos;ve attempted to describe in my &quot;Gentle Introduction?&quot;</p><p>Thanks to you, Dave, and the many others who have contributed to this<br/>dialogue leading me to consider proposing a new category of tunings.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. My longer term &quot;rational continuum intonation&quot; (RCI) emphasizes<br/>that not only is the system based exclusively on integer ratios (as<br/>are many &quot;harmonic-tuning-oriented&quot; JI systems), but that it favors a<br/>continuum of intonational nuances and flavors as defined by such<br/>ratios of any desired complexity on a dense number line, rather than a<br/>tuning set derived mainly from harmonic/subharmonic relations.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16201 href="#16201">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2000 9:40:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
