Good &quot;free&quot; playing is one of<br/>&gt; the best ways to hear what someone can do, and IMHO, to learn about<br/>&gt; the musical attributes of scales.</p><p>Yes, I think we would...</p><p>With that piece I&apos;d just been exploring polyrhythms, which certainly influenced<br/>the playing, so not surprised you like it. I must do more of that. It is great<br/>for developing rhythm without going too kind of metronomic which I don&apos;t like<br/>when improvising. Even a strict metronomic polyrhythm somehow has a much more alive<br/>feel than a strict metronomic 4/4.</p><p>Actually my rhythm is still much better when playing in a very fluid style than<br/>it is when I try to be strict in my timing. Perhaps if I do more polyrhythms<br/>it will be a way for me to develop a better strict rhythm while still having<br/>the relaxed fun element of the fluid rhythms - polyrhythms are very relaxing<br/>somehow when you get them going.</p><p>Sorry to have missed Lawrence&apos;s concert in London with your tunings.</p><p>I&apos;d have liked to have gone, but had a lot on my mind (with FTS mainly),<br/>and somehow didn&apos;t get it together to go. Sounds like it must have been<br/>a lot of fun; I hope he does more and that I can go next time.</p><p>&gt; You and Margo have shown here what I&apos;ve always found to be true -<br/>&gt; what looks bad on paper can be a delight to the ear. The &quot;proof&quot; of a<br/>&gt; tunings worth is to be found in the *music*.</p><p>&gt; And who said 13 tET is the step child of microtonality??? I LOVE this<br/>&gt; tuning!</p><p>Yes, I think it is great too. Really nice tuning actually.</p><p>I&apos;m not posting much at the moment because I&apos;ve got my head down<br/>working on next section of FTS. I&apos;ve decided it really does need<br/>to have the controllers sorted out, so that it will relay properly,<br/>aftertouch as well, which is a bit tricky as the controller messages<br/>have to sync with the notes as they are moved about from one channel<br/>to another to follow the pitch bends.</p><p>However, it is looking okay, I think it will go.</p><p>Then after that the wave to midi things, prob. a FFT main window,<br/>and then maybe can think about finishing the help and doing a release, this year?<br/>Maybe beginning of next is more realistic for the release of<br/>FTS 1.09 at last.</p><p>Then that is just the beginning. Hope to do Scala chords, and Joe&apos;s solar system<br/>orrery (if he is interested in it) - for that I may well be able to do a proper<br/>animated solar system with rotating planets in DirectDraw3D (which is what<br/>games programmers usually use for animations in Windows) - much faster<br/>graphics than anything one can do in normal Windows programming, I&apos;ve got a<br/>book out teaching DirectDraw that has an example that does exactly that.</p><p>For that, had idea that one could make the frequency vary with the &quot;year&quot;,<br/>and the amplitude vary with the &quot;day&quot; as a tremulo effect.</p><p>LOts of other ideas.</p><p>We&apos;ve been talking about this site over in PostTonality:<br/><a href="http://www.flong.com/telesymphony/#audio">http://www.flong.com/telesymphony/#audio</a></p><p>I&apos;ve just found this site for natural sounds:<br/><a href="http://www.earthear.com/index.htm">http://www.earthear.com/index.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2001 3:46:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry everyone, that post was for MMM</p><p>Robert</p></div>
