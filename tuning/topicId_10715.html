Would any of you who know<br/>please tell me what tunings would have been most likely at the time of each<br/>of the following compositions, so that I may pass the information on to the<br/>people presenting the concert?&lt;&lt;</p><p>   The  list that follows is bascially a coverage of the well tempered era,<br/>in which no third was larger than the 21.5 cents, and the rules of<br/>Werckmeister seemed to have been more or less universally accepted.  There<br/>were exceptions, of course, and  intonational history was different  in<br/>different areas.  There are a few simple guidelines to start, but in the end,<br/> the actual listening to the pieces in various temperaments is the only<br/>realistic way to draw any sort of value judement.<br/>     This is of particular interest to me, as we are just completing our<br/>second CD of a well-tempered modern piano, (does anybody remember &quot;Beethoven<br/>In The Temperaments?).  Enid Katahn is playing six pieces in six<br/>temperaments.  The temperament choices were mine, and I based them on<br/>listening to a variety of the likely possiblities that we know of at any<br/>given time.   They are as follows:</p><p>Scarlatti K96  is being done in a Werckmeister (1691)<br/>Mozart Kv385   Prelleur temperament 1731<br/>Haydn nr. 49    Kirnberger III<br/>Beethoven op. 110   Young<br/>Chopin  Impr. 66    DeMorgan<br/>Grieg  &quot;The Bellringer&quot;   in a Coleman 11</p><p>   The DeMorgan and Coleman may be unfamiliar names to most, so if I may<br/>briefly describe them,  The DeMorgan is a reversed order tuning, ie,  the<br/>more accidentals in the signature, the more Just the tonic third. This is<br/>backwards to the Werckmeister inspired, generally accepted, harmonic order,<br/>but we think Chopin&apos;s music does wonderful and unepected things when taken<br/>out of ET.<br/>    Jim Coleman is a contemporary piano technician and theorist.  He used a<br/>spreadsheet to create a range of well temperaments, from a very mild<br/>&quot;bending&quot; of strict ET as in the Victorian era tunings to a very strong<br/>tuning that is just 1 cent short of resembling a Young.  I use his #11 tuning<br/>to introduce customers to non-ET on their pianos, and it has been used in<br/>recording studios here for recording by Steve Earle and Bob Seger, among<br/>others.</p><p>For a starting point, the following groups of pieces could profitably be<br/>tried on the suggested temperaments.  Nothing is carved in stone, you have to<br/>listen to decide. The first temperament is the strongest, the second the<br/>mildest.</p><p>Haydn Sonata in Ab......Werckmeister or Young   {the Werckmeister has a lot<br/>of tonal contrast, the Young is pretty refined sounding.}</p><p> Mozart Sonata in A w/variations<br/> Mozart Sonata in A minor...................The Kirnberger III or the<br/>Prelleur</p><p> Beethoven  Fur Elise............................. Young</p><p> Beethoven Moonlight Sonata<br/> Beethoven  Waldstein Sonata...........Young ( you can hear them in this<br/>tuning on our Beethoven CD)</p><p> Schubert  Sonata in A minor  DV 845<br/> Schumann  Symphonic Etudes, Scenes from Childhood.........Young</p><p> Brahms  Piano Concerto #1<br/> Lizst Sonata in B minor.....................................A &quot;Broadwood&quot;<br/>style, ala Jorgensen</p><p> Chopin  Fantasie in F minor, Prelude in A, Fantasie Impromptu,<br/>Polonaise..Demorgan or a Broadwood</p><p> Puccini  Arias  (transcribed by B.T.)..........I have no idea what would<br/>work here</p><p> Rachmaninoff Prelude in G minor .............Equal Temperament</p><p>         Recognition of key color is a learned skill.  For those that haven&apos;t<br/>done it, the whole concept sounds like &quot;the King has no clothes!&quot;, but for<br/>those that have,  music has a much greater dimension.  The next unequal<br/>tuning project on the horizon is a Cole Porter collection.  We will probably<br/>be using Jim Coleman;s Victorian for all of it.<br/>     Sorry I can&apos;t discuss all the latest super-wazoo-diamond-interlace comput<br/>er scales, but I am pleasently stuck in the 18th and 19th century.

I haven&apos;t tried<br/>any of the tunings with a third over 21 cents for Chopin,  but since I am<br/>going to experiment with a 1/6 comma for the Scarlatti piece, perhaps Enid<br/>will play the Impromptu again on it and we will see.
