Looks like it&apos;s never going to end, either. But, I just realized something about the way people are approaching it...one person says this temperament sounds good, another says that one, and on and on...but, so what? None of you (us) know what BACH thought sounded good, or what his reasons may have been for preferring one tuning over another. As one of the greatest geniuses in musical history, it&apos;s a bit risky to try to assume that what YOU like is what he may or may not have liked. The only quote that ever gets repeated on his tuning preferences is to &quot;tune the 3rds sharp;&quot; well, that could mean several ways of tuning, including eq temps of course...maybe he used a number of different tunings (which, of course, I am sure he did), depending on the piece he was composing. And, maybe he liked different tunings for different pieces, or when he composed for different instruments. I will never believe that this titanic genius was dogmatic about using just one tuning for his whole career, he who was familiar with the music of many nations and styles.</p><p>   And, did he like any of those tunings? Maybe Bach thought all of the tunings available in his time were inadequate to what he was hearing in his head, so he made do with what he had. Maybe he would have preferred 31 or 53 or something else...he is not quoted as ever saying, as far as I know. And, as always, I don&apos;t think he stressed nearly as much about it as the folks here do...the bitterness and sniping at each other seems to come more from one&apos;s ego, than any desire to resolve serious musical issues...or so it seems to me after all the years this has been going on. Maybe a duel would be appropriate...</p><p>  And, in some cases, like the Prelude, Fugue and Allegro in Eb (a great favorite with guitarists), Bach said on the score that the piece was for lute or keyboard; so, he obviously didn&apos;t care that it was played in equal temp. If he was fanatical about circulating temps, seems to me he wouldn&apos;t have wanted his music played on lutes, tuned in eq temp. And, of course, he was always transposing his works from one key to another, and one instrument to another, which would have changed the tuning intervals and the sound of the piece (unless it was intended for eq temp), which says to me that the tuning wasn&apos;t a big deal. Bach loved the sound of the lute...so maybe he loved the sound of equal temperament. Since he went to the great trouble and expense of having 2 lute/claviers built, seems likely that he did...maybe eq temp was his favorite...I don&apos;t know, and neither do you.</p><p>   I was talking about Bach&apos;s tunings with the cellist on my gig the other day...it was a peaceful discussion, and neither one of us cared very much about the final outcome...because we agreed that we, or nobody else, will ever really know, unless more historical info appears. And, in response to a private post the other day from a list member...I have heard Bach in Werck 3, squiggle tuning, and eq temp...best...Hstick   <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>  <a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div>
