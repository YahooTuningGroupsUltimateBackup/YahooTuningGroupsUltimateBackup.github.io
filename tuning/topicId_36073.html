If I&apos;m wrong...I&apos;m wrong. And if<br/>I&apos;m not wrong...there&apos;s an outside chance I may be right.</p><p>My wife Marlene and I have two principles to which we credit our nearly 50<br/>years of successful marriage: (1) keep talking and listening until we think<br/>we understand what the other is saying, and (2) if one is horny the other is<br/>horny.</p><p>My point is that there are a number of clear disagreements that Marlene and<br/>I are content to &quot;live with.&quot; But the key to living with them is to clearly<br/>understand what the disagreements are. I don&apos;t think we always do that here.<br/>In fact, I&apos;m not sure we all *intend* to do that here. (I guess that means<br/>we don&apos;t really have to worry here about the second part of our credo. :-)))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but the recording you provided us with, way back when, certainly<br/>&gt; demonstrated the phenomenon that seems to have started you off on all<br/>&gt; this. it would be great if you could resurrect that recording if at<br/>&gt; all possible. it may help some people understand where you&apos;re coming<br/>&gt; from, and perhaps francois or others could actually measure what&apos;s<br/>&gt; going on in the example. perhaps it will suggest other ideas that may<br/>&gt; help us get beyond our seeming differences in hearing/interpreting<br/>&gt; the synthesized examples.</p><p>Voila!</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://stage3music.com/soundpage.html/">http://stage3music.com/soundpage.html/</a>&gt;</p><p>As I listen to this again, I note that some women (likely not realizing what<br/>the &quot;experiment&quot; is), after locking in at 4:5 move their third upward in<br/>response to the piano&apos;s sounding E. Nevertheless, when the tenors enter,<br/>their third continues upward and holds steady at a point clearly *above* the<br/>piano&apos;s E. I invite the list members to opine whether the women actually<br/>raise their pitch when the tenor fifth is heard or whether it is simply an<br/>illusion. (Is that clearly stated enough, Gene?)</p><p>While this recording is made by brand spanking new singers, the same thing<br/>*always* happens, even with seasoned singers. Na&iuml;vet&eacute; makes no difference<br/>here.</p><p>&gt; hoping for positive developments and mutual edification in all this,<br/>&gt; paul</p><p>I heartily agree. :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=36075 href="#36075">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2002 11:05:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/30/02 11:07 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 24<br/>&gt;  Date: Sun, 31 Mar 2002 06:43:07 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: jerry&apos;s high third example<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jerry --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; right now you seem to me to be making a whole lot of logical leaps<br/>&gt; with your purported explanation of this phenomenon, nearly going so<br/>&gt; far as to accuse some people of being disingenuous. we&apos;ll see where<br/>&gt; the future discussions (which i hope will occur) on the jerry10<br/>&gt; example will take us, but i fear that they (and any other &apos;jerries&apos;)<br/>&gt; may fail to resolve these differences in our points of view (though i<br/>&gt; certainly won&apos;t stop trying).</p><p>An additional thought:</p><p>I do sincerely appreciate your efforts to correct my &quot;logical leaps,&quot;<br/>however, I&apos;m having some trouble incorporating your &quot;corrections&quot; into my<br/>experience bank.

Here we go! I just listened to the first example<br/>called &quot;High Third&quot; at Jerry&apos;s Website on /soundpage.html. I also<br/>listened to the Root-Fifth-hi3 demo further down the list.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I hear, and I am rock solid sure of what I hear. I do<br/>work this fine all the time with my choir. (This is not to say<br/>they are always consistent or that I don&apos;t have to stay on it all the<br/>time. After all, they are amateur singers in rural southeast Iowa in<br/>the &quot;greater&quot; region around a town of 10,000 from which you have to<br/>drive a half hour in any direction to find anything more than a tenth<br/>its size.):</p><p>In the high third example -</p><p>1) The first thing that happens is the basses are unsteady to the<br/>sharp side and do not stay cleanly in unison with the piano. One of<br/>the basses goes slightly sharp right away and stays there for the<br/>duration. The others oscillate slowly between him and the piano<br/>pitch. It&apos;s borderline, but enough so I would tend to make a<br/>correction to that pitch error in my choir.</p><p>2) The sopranos sing very slightly high to a just third from the<br/>outset, probably prompted by the bass tendency to sharp slightly.<br/>When the piano sounds its third (these are actually tenths), the<br/>sopranos, led by one of them, swing immediately afterwards to the<br/>piano third and then on up beyond it well before the tenors&apos; entry on<br/>the fifth.</p><p>3) The tenors are tuned rather well to the just fifth initially and<br/>stay so tuned to the bass throughout, although they do drift upwards<br/>with the bass.</p><p>4) After the tenors enter on the fifth, the sopranos&apos; third actually<br/>lowers toward it a bit, but the bass has meanwhile drifted further<br/>upwards to retune with the high piano third, no other reference<br/>having been provided them since their initial pitch was given.</p><p>5) The sopranos quickly drift back sharp to the piano third once<br/>again. Even though this third is high to the piano, it is only very<br/>slightly high to the bass, and the tenor has remained tuned a just<br/>fifth above the upward drifting bass. The so-called high third is<br/>indeed actually high to the absolute reference of the piano third,<br/>but the bass and tenor have shifted upward sufficiently to make the<br/>triad almost just. (No wonder the &quot;high third&quot; sounds so good.)</p><p>The Root-Fifth-hi3 demo -</p><p>1) The sung pitch here oscillates periodically and somewhat<br/>sporadically between a just and a sharp third. I found this demo<br/>quite amusing, since it clearly demonstrates the almost irresistable<br/>attraction the just third has for the ear in spite of the apparent<br/>attempt to sing sharp to it.</p></div><h3><a id=36107 href="#36107">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2002 6:08:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 4/1/02 11:45 AM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Message: 24<br/>&gt;&gt;  Date: Sun, 31 Mar 2002 06:43:07 -0000<br/>&gt;&gt;  From: &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Subject: jerry&apos;s high third example<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; jerry --<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; last time you were here on this list, you provided us with an example<br/>&gt;&gt; to listen to, in which a bunch of your students sang first a 2:5<br/>&gt;&gt; dyad, then added the 3, while you periodically played the nearest<br/>&gt;&gt; note to the 5 on a piano. the piano note sounded sharp (compared with<br/>&gt;&gt; the nearest vocal note) at first, then as the 3 was added, the piano<br/>&gt;&gt; note began to sound flatter and flatter, until it matched the vocal<br/>&gt;&gt; note, and perhaps even sunk below it.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>--------</p><p>&gt;&gt; the recording certainly<br/>&gt;&gt; demonstrated the phenomenon that seems to have started you off on all<br/>&gt;&gt; this. it would be great if you could resurrect that recording if at<br/>&gt;&gt; all possible. it may help some people understand where you&apos;re coming<br/>&gt;&gt; from, and perhaps francois or others could actually measure what&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; going on in the example. perhaps it will suggest other ideas that may<br/>&gt;&gt; help us get beyond our seeming differences in hearing/interpreting<br/>&gt;&gt; the synthesized examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Voila!</p><p>Whoops!
