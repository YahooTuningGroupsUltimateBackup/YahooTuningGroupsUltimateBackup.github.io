Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2003 5:38:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone, and I&apos;d like to share my excitement on trying a<br/>tuning for the first time -- with warm gratitude to Gene Ward Smith<br/>for an article which led me to reflect on the creative expression of<br/>squirrel-like qualities in music, and thus to tune this modified<br/>meantone system.</p><p>As I&apos;ll explain more in a longer message, squirrels can for me stand<br/>for a variety of qualities such as beauty, agility, grace,<br/>incisiveness, playfulness, and a bit of unpredictability. Of course,<br/>incisiveness ties in very nicely with my taste for large and expansive<br/>major thirds (Pythagorean or wider), and compact semitones<br/>(Pythagorean or smaller).</p><p>Thus it intuitively appeals to me to associate squirrel-like qualities<br/>in a 12-note circulating system with major thirds larger than 400<br/>cents -- or, I would say, more specifically such thirds substantially<br/>larger than the Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82 cents). This means that it<br/>is squirrel-like to have some fifths tempered wider than pure; in<br/>contrast, a conventional 12-note &quot;well-temperament&quot; has all fifths<br/>either pure or tempered in the narrow direction.</p><p>A 12-note circulating temperament with some fifths wider than pure is<br/>often known as a _temperament ordinaire_. This genre seems to have<br/>developed in France around the middle to later 17th-century (although<br/>Schlick&apos;s irregular organ temperament of 1511 might qualify), and has<br/>had exponents ranging from Rameau and Alembert to George Secor, whose<br/>system sometimes known as &quot;Secor No. 3&quot; is an outstanding example.</p><p>Last year I mentioned the idea of a system which Gene&apos;s articles<br/>prompted me actually to tune -- with much excitement and delight.</p><p>In this &quot;temperament extraordinaire,&quot; as I call it, the eight fifths<br/>in the range F-C# are tempered as usual in 1/4-comma meantone, and the<br/>other four are tempered by identical amounts in the _wide_ direction<br/>to close the circle, about 4.888 cents each. The result is a tuning<br/>circle in which all fifths are within 1/4-comma of pure, while major<br/>thirds range from 4:5 (~386.31 cents) to 25:32 (~427.373 cents). That&apos;s<br/>what I call &quot;modal color.&quot;</p><p>Another way to describe this is to say that the just 25:32 major third<br/>or diminished fourth at C#-F, already defined by the tuning of the<br/>first nine notes in regular meantone, is divided into four equal<br/>fifths C#-G#-D#-A#-E# or Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F at about 706.843 cents, and<br/>into two even-tones Db-Eb-F or C#-D#-E# at about 213.686 cents each.</p><p>Just as the usual meantone fifths are tempered narrow by 1/4 syntonic<br/>comma (81:80, ~21.506 cents), or ~5.377 cents, so these wide fifths<br/>are tempered by 1/4 of the &quot;small comma&quot; of 2048:2025 (~19.553 cents),<br/>the difference between a 25:32 major third and a Pythagorean major<br/>third formed from four pure fifths (~407.820 cents). This difference<br/>is one meaning of the term &quot;diaschisma,&quot; which can also refer to a<br/>larger type of interval equal to half of a Pythagorean diatonic<br/>semitone or limma at 256:243 (~90.224 cents), or about 45.112 cents.</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala file:</p><p>! qcmte84a.scl<br/>!<br/>Temperament extraordinaire: F-C# 1/4-comma meantone, other 5ths ~4.888c wide<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 76.04900<br/> 193.15686<br/> 289.73529<br/> 5/4<br/> 503.42157<br/> 579.47057<br/> 696.57843<br/> 782.89214<br/> 889.73529<br/> 996.57843<br/> 1082.89214<br/> 2/1</p><p>A special delight of this tuning is that a chain of one usual narrow<br/>fifth plus three wide fifths (e.g. F#-C#-G#-D#-A#) produces a major<br/>third of ~417.108 cents, only ~0.40 cents from a pure 11:14 (~417.508<br/>cents). Similarly, a chain of two wide fifths plus one narrow fifth<br/>(e.g. Eb-Bb-F-C) produces a minor third of ~289.735 cents, only ~0.526<br/>cents from a pure 11:13 (~289.210 cents).</p><p>A characteristic of this temperament extraordinaire is that interval<br/>sizes within a given category (e.g. major thirds) jump in steps of<br/>about 10.265 cents, or 1/4 of the 128:125 diesis (~41.059 cents)<br/>defining the difference between the regular meantone diatonic semitone<br/>at ~117.108 cents (e.g. C#-D) and chromatic semitone at ~76.049 cents<br/>(e.g. C-C#). This large a jump in a circulating temperament could be<br/>described as somewhat &quot;squirrel-like,&quot; in contrast to the finer<br/>gradations typical of many conventional 12-note well-temperaments.</p><p>For example, there are major thirds at around 386.314 cents (the usual<br/>just 4:5); 396.578 cents (comparable to 1/8-comma meantone); 406.843<br/>cents (close to Pythagorean); 417.108 cents (a virtually just 11:14);<br/>and 427.373 cents (the meantone diminished fourth at a just 25:32)</p><p>The near-Pythagorean thirds Eb-G and B-D#, and especially the<br/>near-11:14 thirds (Ab-C, Gb-Bb) and 25:32 third (Db-F) are ideal for a<br/>neo-medieval kind of style where they tend to expand to stable fifths,<br/>often together with major sixths expanding to octaves. These intervals<br/>could indeed be described as optimal in such a context, just as the<br/>usual meantone intervals are ideal for a typical Renaissance idiom.</p><p>There are actually two reasons I would give to leave the eight fifths<br/>from F to C# in regular meantone: to maintain an uncompromising<br/>meantone quality for lots of the most common Renaissance sonorities;<br/>and at the same time to include at least one 25:32 diminished fourth<br/>(a superb neo-Gothic major third as well as &quot;special effects&quot; interval<br/>in some 16th-century music) and two excellent 76-cent semitones (C-C#<br/>and F-F#, also spelled in neo-medieval contexts as C-Db and F-Gb).</p><p>We might define a temperament extraordinaire as a subcategory of<br/>12-note temperament ordinaire or modified meantone system where at<br/>least eight of the fifths are left in regular meantone, thus including<br/>at least one standard diminished fourth (e.g. 25:32 in 1/4-comma).<br/>To this I would add the ideal of a &quot;reasonably smooth and even quality&quot;<br/>for all fifths: the wide fifths optimally should not be tempered<br/>substantially more than the regular meantone fifths. Here they are<br/>tempered a bit less (about 4.89 cents wide, vis-a-vis 5.38 cents<br/>narrow).</p><p>We might consider it an especially characteristic procedure simply to<br/>tune a chain of eight fifths in a regular meantone, with the other<br/>four tempered equally wide. This approach could be especially<br/>attractive in the general range from around 1/4-comma to Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma (regular fifths ~6.14 cents narrow, others ~6.42 cents<br/>wide), with the latter tuning offering a diminished fourth (~433.517<br/>cents) very close to a pure 7:9 (~435.084 cents).</p><p>While the 25:32 of our 1/4-comma temperament extraordinaire is not so<br/>close to 7:9, I was delighted today to find this approximation of a<br/>sonority to which Paul Erlich introduced me, the 4:6:7:9 chord:</p><p>                   F4   F#4<br/>                   Db4  B3<br/>                   Bb3  B3<br/>                   Eb3  B2</p><p>Here I&apos;ve used the first spelling that occurred to me: equivalents in<br/>a 12-note circle are quite an adventure to me, with the 17-note<br/>equivalents more familiar. The near-4:6:7:9 is around 0-707-986-1414<br/>cents, generally rather less accurate than in Paul&apos;s beloved 22-EDO,<br/>but a treat to find in a 12-note circle. As it happens, Bb-F-Ab-C<br/>would have yielded about 0-707-986-1403 cents, closer in terms of<br/>ratios above the lowest voice. In fairness, I should add that George<br/>Secor&apos;s temperament ordinaire or modified meantone, although the<br/>largest major third of ~418.573 cents (a near-11:14) is further from<br/>7:9, has a position (Bb-F-Ab-C) which does better overall (around<br/>0-702-985-1400 cents, including a pure 2:3 and a more accurate 4:7<br/>above the lowest note).</p><p>Anyway, I find that my temperament extraordinaire has me fascinated<br/>with the transpositions, modal colors, and &quot;enharmonic equivalents&quot;<br/>possible in a 12-note circle. The system seems like a fusion of two<br/>universes: a usual meantone universe (F-C#) merging into a realm more<br/>like a 17-note circle, with the wide fifths tempered by an amount<br/>recalling the nearer nine fifths (Ab-B) of George Secor&apos;s 17-tone<br/>well-temperament (17-WT) at ~5.265 cents wide.</p><p>Thanks to Gene for that set of posts leading me to consider<br/>squirrel-like 12-note circles, and also to George Secor for the<br/>inspiring example of his temperament ordinaire or modified meantone<br/>system.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2003 4:11:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

There,<br/>however, one size of fifth is typically pure while the other is impure<br/>by some comma equal to the difference of whole-tone sizes, for example<br/>9:8 vis-a-vis 10:9 or 8:7; here the two fifths are impure by almost<br/>identical amounts (-5.38 cents or +4.89 cents), but in opposite<br/>directions. The two tetrachords Eb-F-F#-G# (214-76-203) and Bb-C-C#-Eb<br/>(203-76-214) have the same interval sizes, but differently ordered,<br/>for a bit of squirrel-like and squirrely asymmetry.</p><p>Here the near-11:14 thirds are formed from a 203-cent plus a 214-cent<br/>step at F#-Bb, or vice versa at G#-C. Two of the large 214-cent steps<br/>(actually ~213.686 cents) form the just 25:32 at C#-F.</p><p>Gene, when you talked about a temperament turning into a scale, this<br/>might suggest looking especially at a curious affinity to a style of<br/>JI/RI with &quot;virtual temperament&quot; that I&apos;ve used in a neo-medieval<br/>system. You mentioned the close approximations of 11:14 and 11:13,<br/>which might make the question of brats (beat rates) a bit less<br/>important for at least this portion of the tuning circle, but there&apos;s<br/>a special squirrel-like (or squirrely?) quirk here: the tempered<br/>interval sizes almost exactly mirror the 121:154:182 or 121:143:182<br/>sonorities that occur in a &quot;virtually tempered&quot; system.</p><p>In other words, we have a sonority consisting of an 11:14 major third<br/>below and an 11:13 minor third above (121:154:182), or the converse<br/>(121:143:182), with a wide 121:182 fifth exceeding a pure 2:3 by the<br/>11-13 schisma of 363:364 (~4.763 cents). Our tempered Dorian mode<br/>includes very close approximations of both arrangements:</p><p>       C#5                    Bb4<br/> (706.84, -0.125)       (706.84, -0.125)<br/>       Bb4                    F#4<br/> (417.11, -0.40)        (289.74, +0.535)<br/>       F#4                    Eb4</p><p>  ~121:154:182           ~121:143:182</p><p>The charm of this temperament is that in addition to excellent<br/>neo-medieval scales and modes like this, which invite either<br/>drone-based melody or polyphony in a 13th-century European style (a<br/>good opportunity for me to practice more remote transpositions), we<br/>get an impeccable 1/4-comma meantone in the range of F-C#.</p><p>Such a scheme illustrates an exception to the rule that wide fifths in<br/>a 12-note circle constitute &quot;harmonic waste,&quot; an exception implied in<br/>Owen Jorgensen&apos;s explanation of this rule applying to conventional<br/>well-temperaments of this size. Generally one assumes that fifths are<br/>meant to be tempered in the narrow direction, with major thirds<br/>ideally near 4:5 and minor thirds near 5:6, so that unnecessary<br/>&quot;reverse tempering&quot; needlessly increases the inaccuracy of a scheme.</p><p>Here, however, wide fifths are just as useful in producing ~11:14 or<br/>25:32 major thirds and 76-cent semitones for use in a neo-medieval<br/>context as narrow ones are in producing the usual Renaissance meantone<br/>intervals.</p><p>Indeed, as I mentioned in my previous message, the wide fifths at<br/>~4.888 cents larger than pure are very close to the size of the nearer<br/>fifths in George Secor&apos;s 17-tone well-temperament at about 5.265 cents<br/>wide. We have, as it were, a bit of neo-medieval forest or park in the<br/>midst of a meantone metropolis -- or meantone countryside, as you like<br/>your metaphors.</p><p>Anyway, Gene and Bob, thanks again for your ideas and encouragement!</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2003 8:48:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
