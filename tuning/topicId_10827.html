He hasn&apos;t published any of his work and is just now<br/>getting it on hi web pages. I don&apos;t think he is a composer, but I will<br/>ask. So far, he seems primarily interested in theory (from JI, it<br/>seems), though he certainly is not hostile to ets. I&apos;m still unclear<br/>about the details of his theoretical approach, but I expect I&apos;ll learn<br/>more as he posts more.</p><p>Ed B. I think I met the same composer at an ICMC in 1981. As I recall he<br/>said he turned to electronics after a distrous experience with a oboist<br/>for whom he had written a piece. It seems that during a rehearsal, the<br/>oboist suddenly put down his/her instrument and said that his music made<br/>him sick. Then the performer ran out of the room and threw up.</p><p>--John</p></div>
