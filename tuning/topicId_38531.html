Sometimes they will identify an<br/>equal-tempered chord as &quot;happy, upbeat,&quot; and the same chord in just<br/>intonation as &quot;sad, gloomy.&quot; Of course, this is the first time<br/>they&apos;ve ever heard anything but equal temperament, and they&apos;re far<br/>more familiar with the first sound than the second. But I think<br/>they correctly hit on the point that equal temperament chords do have<br/>a kind of active buzz to them, a level of harmonic excitement<br/>and intensity. By contrast, just-intonation chords are much calmer,<br/>more passive; you literally have to slow down to listen to them.<br/>(As Terry Riley says, Western music is fast because it&apos;s not in tune.)<br/>It makes sense that American teenagers would identify tranquil,<br/>purely consonant harmony as moody and depressing. Listening from the<br/>other side, I&apos;ve learned to hear equal temperament music as<br/>a kind of aural caffeine, overly busy and nervous-making. If you&apos;re<br/>used to getting that kind of buzz from music, you feel the lack of<br/>it as a deprivation when it&apos;s not there. But do we need it? Most<br/>cultures use music for meditation, and ours may be the only culture<br/>that doesn&apos;t. With our tuning, we can&apos;t.</p><p>My teacher, Ben Johnston, was convinced that our tuning is responsible<br/>for much of our cultural psychology, the fact that we are so<br/>geared toward progress and action and violence and so little attuned<br/>to introspection, contentment, and acquiesence. Equal<br/>temperament could be described as the musical equivalent to eating a<br/>lot of red meat and processed sugars and watching violent<br/>action films. The music doesn&apos;t turn your attention inward, it makes<br/>you want to go out and work off your nervous energy on<br/>something.&quot;</p><p>&lt;end of Kyle Gann quote&gt;</p><p>What patent nonsense. I personally find that Brahm&apos;s lullaby, for<br/>example, is very soothing in 12-equal. If it is more so in JI, the<br/>difference is extremely small.</p><p>Do you see what I (and Julia) mean?</p><p>I suppose that some JI proponents feel they need to make such<br/>outrageous statements against non-JI tunings to try to counteract the<br/>huge amount of ignorance and inertia working against acceptance of JI.<br/>But I hope we can all see now that they really don&apos;t help the cause at<br/>all. They just lead to further reactions in the opposite direction<br/>like those of Julia&apos;s dissertation.</p><p>Perhaps the time is ripe for a little reconciliation. And a little<br/>recognition that there is a hell of a lot of middle ground between<br/>strict JI and 12-equal. We should be building bridges not fortifying<br/>bunkers. 72-ET is a marvelous bridge.</p></div><h3><a id=38547 href="#38547">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2002 6:01:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38531.html#38542">/tuning/topicId_38531.html#38542</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having read David Doty&apos;s excellent recent post to this list<br/>on &quot;False reification&quot; I cannot call him a JI Fundamentalist, but the<br/>following earlier claim by him remains on the JIN website.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See <a href="http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/">http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The simple-ratio intervals upon which Just Intonation is based are<br/>&gt; the fundamental constituents of melody and harmony.

You seem to be stuck in some kind of JI v/s ET<br/>&gt; limbo. Wake up Kraig ! It&apos;s not real !

Go into a store and look in the experimental section. It is divorced from such dead ends and it&apos;s practices are antiquated at best.

I&apos;d like that plastered on a T-shirt. I dare<br/>&gt; say some JI hard heads would sooner suck a lemon than utter a<br/>&gt; sentence like that.</p><p>why? (BTW i studied with him )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  I can see it has provided nothing more<br/>&gt; &gt; than one more thing for academia to &quot;talk &quot; about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree. But will say that if *mainstream* music academia<br/>&gt; could get it&apos;s butt off the couch and show some courage, we&apos;d<br/>&gt; have a hope.
