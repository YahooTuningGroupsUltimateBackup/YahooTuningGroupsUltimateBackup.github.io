That is, if forced to answer<br/>&gt; the &quot;do other people see red&quot; question,<br/>&gt; I&apos;d say yes.  I think this stuff sounds<br/>&gt; the same, more or less, to most of us.</p><p>Me too.  I wasn&apos;t criticizing your descriptions,<br/>just noting how subjective they ultimately are.<br/>I agree that most people get pretty much the<br/>same sensations from prime-affect, but it<br/>*is* hard to pin down in words.  Again, that&apos;s<br/>why we use the music to express these things,<br/>instead of using language.</p><p>It&apos;s one of my main contentions (in my book)<br/>that the feelings people get from music are<br/>largely due to the composer&apos;s/performer&apos;s<br/>manipulation of these prime-affects.</p><p>- Monzo<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
