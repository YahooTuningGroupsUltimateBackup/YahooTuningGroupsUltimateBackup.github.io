I obtained a copy of relevant pages of the facsimile (80-81 and Errata) and compared with the Hehr translation.</p><p>The first question is - What is Werckmeister talking about? Chapter 31 comes after the end of Chapter 30 where the tuning procedure for &apos;Werckmeister IV&apos; (the tuning with 1/3 comma temperings) is described verbally. C-G tempered, G-D pure, D-A tempered, A-E pure etc.</p><p>Then it says &apos;This temperament is also represented on the monochord [with] a little discrepancy, without any laborious procedure.&apos; So he is still talking about &apos;IV&apos; and giving some monochord numbers that are nearly equivalent to the temperament but easier to apply.</p><p>Just after the numbers he talks of the practical problems that may arise when using a monochord, and says it could be used to tune a harpsichord or clavichord (&apos;Instrument oder clavichordium&apos;). Elsewhere in his works Werckmeister mentions how difficult it is to tune organs to monochords because of the difference in their characters of sound.</p><p>So let&apos;s look at the numbers. In the facsimile they are</p><p>C 120 C# 114 1/2 d 107 1/5 D# 101 1/5 E 95 3/5 F 90 F# 85 1/3 G 80 2/5 G# 76 2/15 A 71 7/10 Bb 67 1/5 B 64 C 60.</p><p>However Hehr&apos;s translation gives 80 1/5 for G. This is a mistake and leads to the erroneous idea that G-D is tempered, which obscures the derivation from &apos;IV&apos;. Johnny R. converts the numbers to decimals and gets G 80.2 - which ought to be 80.4. (In cents, 693.3 not 697.6).</p><p>Since the pattern of pure and tempered fifths is now clearly supposed to be the same as &apos;IV&apos;, we can deduce a further misprint as C# 114.5 is not a pure fifth from G# and is a very flat fifth from F# 85.33. (Remember these are string lengths!). But if we enforce C#-G# to be a pure fifth we get</p><p>C# = 114.2 or 114 1/5</p><p>It is easy to allow for a misprint 1/5 -&gt; 1/2 here. Having taken care of this we get a scale</p><p>0<br/>85.8<br/>195.3<br/>295.0<br/>393.5<br/>498.0<br/>590.2<br/>693.3<br/>787.7<br/>891.6<br/>1003.8<br/>1088.3</p><p>the approximation to &apos;IV&apos; using monochord numbers, which W. thinks can be acceptable for stringed keyboard instruments. There is no &apos;extra&apos; Werckmeister tuning, unless you count the result of superimposed typos as an extra...</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament</a></p><p>Best,<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div>
