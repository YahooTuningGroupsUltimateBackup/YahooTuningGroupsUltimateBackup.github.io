If we had more<br/>understanding of what we actually do to other people when we support<br/>those who oppress them, kill them as collateral damage, remove their<br/>elected leaders when they do not support our business interests, we<br/>might understand how we make some folks madder than hornets. Now,<br/>Islamic holy war is a whole nother thing, and I am not talking about<br/>trying to understand what we do to provoke these nuts. We actually do<br/>need to promote peace and understanding, and the artists have a large<br/>part in this. Certainly you don&apos;t advocate killing just any Arabs, do<br/>you?</p><p>I had an Afghani student who had to escape on foot when the Russians<br/>invaded. When the Taliban took over, his family was still unable to<br/>return because they were Sufi. We had long discussions on music and<br/>religion, and he pointed out that the majority of Muslims do not<br/>believe that the Koran literally calls for the death of all infidels,<br/>or holy war, or any of the ultra violent nonsense that the<br/>fundamentalists have been promting. He turned me on to a lot of cool<br/>microtonal Afghani music, and he was a gentle and intelligent person.<br/>I am sure there are many like him living under the rule of violent<br/>thugs, who have the *same religion* as far as those not in the know<br/>are concerned. All Muslims are not the same, and you no more know the<br/>soul of a Christian mystic by studying the pronouncements of Jerry<br/>Falwell than you know the soul of the French farmer by visiting<br/>Parisian tourist traps in August. Seriously.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
