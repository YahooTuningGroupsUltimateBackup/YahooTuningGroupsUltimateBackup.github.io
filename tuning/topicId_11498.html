Erlich;<br/>    To my ear, these are extremely consonant chords, much more than your western practice<br/>numerals would make you think. I also don&apos;t understand your &quot;research&quot; concerning the<br/>subharmonic chords for I have always heard them as consonant. harmonically based chords many<br/>times just blend into a timbre. The problem must be with my ears as it is hard to imagine that<br/>science could be mistaken. Subharmonic chords have to my ear a greater depth. In Anaphoria, it<br/>is considered that these sounds are descending from heaven , as the guide tone is found above.</p><p>                                    -- Banaphshu</p><p>&quot;Paul H.
