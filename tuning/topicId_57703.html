The greek definition of (or what we think<br/>they imply by) such expressions as &quot;diatonic&quot; and &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>differs from the &apos;modern&apos; (?) use. There is no problem with this<br/>divergence, as long as we don&acute;t insist on arguing whether a certain<br/>scale is diatonic because it has x different letters or because &quot;x<br/>tethrachord... this and that&quot;.</p><p>I assume it would be difficult to generate a unique definition<br/>comprenhating this variety of terming. Who knows, consensus may<br/>overrule this statement.</p><p>As for what I think of when hearing the word &apos;diatonic&apos;, I would<br/>like to sketch the following lines of reasoning:</p><p>1) First, I assume a &apos;complete&apos; series of notes conforming a scale<br/>[this is the &apos;chromatic&apos; scale]<br/>2) I recognise a pattern of notation defining base notes and altered<br/>notes. In most cases, I would expect that the notation have some<br/>connection with the tritriadic (or 12-eq) naming; however, i accept<br/>this might be just a preconception.<br/>3) I interpret (as stated repeatedly before this post) &apos;diatonic&apos;<br/>as &apos;implying a selection of notes from the &apos;chromatic&apos; scale<br/>explained above, such that:&apos;<br/>   &apos;a) it contains all (7 in my &quot;preconception&quot;) names of notes&apos;<br/>   &apos;b) the scheme of altered notes included is such that no unison<br/>or case of &quot;higher note followed by lower&quot; is present [eg. b#-c or<br/>e##-f ruled out]&apos;</p><p>Of course, according to our accustomed, tired 12-eq ears, many<br/>scales &apos;diatonic&apos; following this definition, won&apos;t sound at all like<br/>the diatonic character we remember from 12-eq cdefgab pattern.</p><p>Lastly, assume this is to be taken as my humble view on the issue; I<br/>welcome critisisms or comments.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2005 7:47:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Maximiliano, it is a pleasure to meet a Westerner who can agree to such a possibility even though the scales are sure to sound quite alien.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Maximiliano G.
