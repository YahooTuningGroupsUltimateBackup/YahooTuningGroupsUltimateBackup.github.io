So the peaks<br/>are prominent on the oscilloscope.</p><p>Any wave one can recognise on the oscilloscope<br/>by it&apos;s prominent highest peak could in principle<br/>be found this way, and then the pitch figured<br/>by wave crossings.</p><p>As you see from the ex. clips, even works if<br/>you have some reasonably quiet background music<br/>with a main singer / instrumentalist (if timbre is suitable).</p><p>&gt; Sorry I can&apos;t be of help here but it looks to me like<br/>&gt; you&apos;re the current expert in this field.</p><p>I suppose perhaps I am ;-), by default of being the only<br/>one I know of working on it at all - I&apos;ve done web search<br/>and can&apos;t find anything yet on anyone else using a wave<br/>crossing technique for pitch detection.</p><p>Anyone heard of such a thing before?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
