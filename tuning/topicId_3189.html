The learning curve for simple processes isn&apos;t bad,<br/>but can be daunting for more complex &quot;systems.&quot;  Overall, it is a<br/>tremendous system that offers just about any type of signal processing<br/>you could imagine, and in real-time (including real-time granular<br/>synthesis).  With regard to alternate tuning systems, Kyma is at least<br/>&quot;capable.&quot;  I did a lot of experimenting with 13-tet of 3/1, 8-tet of<br/>the Golden Mean, as well as some ethnic tunings taken from the &quot;Tuning<br/>In&quot; book recently mentioned on this list.  I do remember having<br/>difficulty getting Kyma to map the keyboard correctly (regardless of the<br/>&quot;pseudo-octave&quot;, an octave on the keyboard came out as an octave, not a<br/>3/1 or a 1.618, etc.), but I found a work around, and there have been a<br/>couple software/firmware revisions since then, so it may all be ironed<br/>out.<br/>&#x9;In all, I loved the Kyma--pretty well open architecture (even allowed a<br/>sample to be FM&apos;d by another sample--imagine a trumpet being modulated<br/>by a bell!)</p><p>&#x9;If you have any questions about specifics, I may be able to help,<br/>though it has been a year since I used it.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jon Southwood</p></div>
