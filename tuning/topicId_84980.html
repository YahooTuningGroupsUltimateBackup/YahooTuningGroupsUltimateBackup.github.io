I suspect this is because<br/>      a) Harmonics of real life instruments, which the ear seems to be designed to hear clearly, are in non-reverse order<br/>      b) In non-reverse order smaller intervals take place at higher frequencies, where the ear is able to tolerate closer intervals between frequencies without beating issues (of course, beating contributes to dissonance).<br/>    For example if you compare the chord 400hz:500hz:600hz to 400hz :481hz:600hz (apx. a 1/(6:5:4) chord)...the most beating ratio in the first chord (600/500) is higher while the most beating ratio in the second (481/400) is lower and, as we know from Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s dissonance curves, the ear has more tolerance for close ratios at higher frequencies.</p><p>2) It&apos;s not an either/or situation.      1/(6:5:4) may very well be more consonant than, say 6:7:9 much because the 7:6 ratio beats more than any two frequencies in the 1/(6:5:4).  In that case, psy-acoustics (in terms of Helmholtz&apos;s beating theory) seems to more than cancel out the advantages of periodicity gained by using harmonics instead of sub-harmonics.</p><p>    So, to try and sum it up, I believe that chords based on harmonics generally sound better UNLESS the compared chord with sub-harmonics which either beat significantly less and/or have their closest ratios at much lower frequencies.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: monz &lt;joemonz@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Tue, October 20, 2009 12:22:44 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: the &quot;math&quot; of the minor triad</p><p>I didn&apos;t really follow this thread much, but from what<br/>i&apos;ve read here, my suspicion is that it may be a reference<br/>to dualism -- the possibility that we can perceive ratios<br/>(or really, proportions containing 2 or more ratios)<br/>as either otonalities or utonalities, that is, either<br/>harmonic or subharmonic.</p><p>For example, the typical JI minor triad with ratios<br/>1:1 - 6:5 - 3:2 can be analyzed as a proportion either<br/>harmonically as 10:12:15, or subharmonically as<br/>1/6:1/5:1/4 or to write it more neatly 1/(6:5:4).<br/>Obviously in this case the subharmonic (i.e., utonal)<br/>analysis provides smaller numbers as therefore can be<br/>construed as the more valid interpretation.</p><p>However, there is a _lot_ of debate among tuning theorists,<br/>and among music theorists in general, about this duality theory.<br/>Some subscribe to it wholeheartedly (Oettingen, Hugo Riemann,<br/>Partch), others think it&apos;s a bunch of nonsense, and most fall<br/>somewhere in between.

The following sound file demonstrates this phenomenon,<br/>using sine waves &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_waves">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_waves</a>&gt;, pure and simple<br/>waves for which this phenomena is most easily evident.</p><p>But I&apos;m not sure if I can agree to a link between the phantom fundamental<br/>and the root of a chord.<br/>Especially in case fo the 10:12:15 minor chord which doesn&apos;t have a phantom<br/>fundamental of 10.<br/>So I may be a subscriber of utonal.</p><p>But about the &quot;root&quot; of a chord.<br/>I think I&apos;d like to think more in terms of tonic of a chord.<br/>In this sense the &quot;root&quot; tonic of a 1/1 6/5 3/2 chord is 1/1 only if 1/1 is<br/>the tonic.<br/>We also find 10:12:15 chord as 1/1 5/4 5/3 where 1/1 is the tonic. I don&apos;t<br/>think the &quot;root&quot; of the chord is 5/3 in this case.<br/>We also find it at 1/1 4/3 8/5 and 9/8 3/2 9/5.<br/>And also the wolf minor triad of 9/8 4/3 5/3, and an unnamed minor of 8/5<br/>15/8 6/5<br/>I think one could very well say that all of these above chords in the tonic<br/>of 1/1 have their origin in 1/1 and therefore one could say 1/1 is the<br/>&quot;root&quot; or the source of the chord.</p><p>As for how the origin of these chord could come from the tonic, I recently<br/>realised that my old harmonic interval permutation theory could explain it<br/>all.<br/>Take the harmonic series and construct intervals be rearanging the order of<br/>the harmonics (on can describe it in many ways but this one is easy to<br/>understand)<br/>So take for instance 1/1 2/1 3/1 harmonic series.<br/>Then one can also make 1/1 3/2 3/1.<br/>We could say that when limiting the harmonic series to the third harmonic<br/>that one gets the intervals 1/1 3/2 2/1 3/1 by all possible permutations of<br/>these harmonics.<br/>We could say 3/1 has as it&apos;s source 1/1 and can be constructed of either a<br/>2/1 and a 3/2, or a 3/2 and a 2/1<br/>When limiting till the fourth harmonic you get the following harmonic<br/>interval permutation product set:<br/>1/1 4/3 3/2 2/1 8/3 3/1 4/1</p><p>When limiting till the fifth harmonic you get the following harmonic<br/>interval permutation product set:<br/>1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 5/2 8/3 3/2 10/3 15/4 4/1 5/1</p><p>When limiting till the sixth harmonic you get the following harmonic<br/>interval permutation product set:<br/>1/1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 9/4 12/5 5/2 8/3 3/1 16/5 10/3 18/5<br/>15/4 4/1 9/2 24/5 5/1 6/1</p><p>Put in one octave you get 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1</p><p>These are 100% utonal &lt;-&gt; tonal equal sets btw.</p><p>All of these intervals in the above scales a the simplest intervals comming<br/>from 1/1 in their construction withing their harmonic limit.<br/>All of these intervals in these scales can be related to 1/1 and can be said<br/>to be comming from 1/1.<br/>I recently realised this is a great defenition of tonality and tonic!<br/>I now use the above 6-limit tonality scale as my basis for tuning and<br/>determining the tonic and it&apos;s amazing how well it works and makes sense.<br/>It fits all chords it seems, for instance 9/8 4/3 8/5 15/8 we only find in<br/>this place, and it indeed has as it&apos;s tonic 1/1 etc etc<br/>I also find most scales, except some maqam, gypsy scales and the whole tone<br/>scale.<br/>These scales may come from a modulation, or they may be harmonic 7-limit.<br/>Harmonic 7-limit will give the following tonality scale in one octave btw:<br/>1/1 21/20 35/32 9/8 7/6 6/5 5/4 21/16 4/3 7/5 35/24 3/2 14/9 8/5 5/3 7/4 9/5<br/>28/15 15/8 35/18 2/1</p><p>Still experimenting a lot but this all could explain a lot.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2009 8:44:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>&gt; Regardless of what view one subscribes to,<br/>&gt; one must take into account that there is<br/>&gt; virtually unanimous agreement that the root<br/>&gt; of a 1/(6:5:4) (or 10:12:15) triad is 1/6 (or 10),<br/>&gt; not 1/4 (or 15).</p><p>I haven&apos;t read any subsequent responses to this yet,<br/>but here&apos;s my response:</p><p>Those who do subscribe to dualism are precisely those who<br/>are the exceptions to that &quot;virtually unanimous agreement&quot;,<br/>in that they are exactly the theorists who consider<br/>the 1/4 (or 15) to be the &quot;root&quot;.</p><p>Partch&apos;s theory is probably the best explanation<br/>of this: he calls 1/4 (or 15) the &quot;1-udentity&quot;, which<br/>makes it the &quot;root&quot; from a subharmonic perspective.</p><p>However, it is true that there are far more theorists<br/>who consider the &quot;root&quot; to be the note which &quot;belongs&quot;<br/>at the bottom of a subset of the harmonic series.<br/>As i said, there&apos;s a lot of disagreement over dualism.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2009 9:25:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Regardless of what view one subscribes to, one must take into account that there is virtually unanimous agreement that the root of a 1/(6:5:4) (or 10:12:15) triad is 1/6 (or 10), not 1/4 (or 15).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>An interesting thing I&apos;ve always noticed about 10:12:15 is that I can<br/>feel it out as having two distinct roots - the 10 and the 12.

The scaffolding for that organization is the harmonic series, and the fundamental of the harmonics is the root of the triad.

If a chord contains a *single* 2:3 or 3:4 (whether just or tempered), then I can almost guarantee that the tone represented by the 3 will *never* be heard as the root of the chord.  (There are instances, e.g., 8:10:15, that a tone not in the 2:3 interval will be perceived as the root, but that&apos;s not critical to the point that I&apos;m making.)

This instability is on harmonic domain, not melodic, and it&apos;s not connected with harmonic function in functional harmony, and concerns all chords, major, minor... Even such banal progression like D7-T will sound open and unfinished if chords are for example in inversions 2 and 6 (bass notes F-E in C major).

However, this (thinking they are the same because they are the same in certain music with strong limitations) is an illusion, and a deadly, or at least cheesey as hell, into which to fall.</p><p>&gt; Right now I think this tonality scale for common practice music is &gt;all<br/>&gt; possible permutations of the harmonic series limited to the sixth &gt;harmonic.</p><p>This depends on what is meant by modulation.</p><p>&gt; This gives the following tonality scale (when reduced to one &gt;octave): 1/1<br/>&gt; 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; In this system for instance a dominant major 7th chord would be 4/3 &gt;3/2 15/8<br/>&gt; 9/4 and have as it&apos;s source / root 1/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t think of a single example that would couteract this line of<br/>&gt; thinking.<br/>&gt; If you can please give an example.</p><p>Ravel Pavane for a Dead Princess. It fits the idea of a single complex Just sonority as the structure for the entire piece, but it doesn&apos;t work with your particular tuning, try it yourself. A lot of later tonal music is better described as being built on the Just structure derived directly from the harmonics, that is, C-D-E-F#-G-A-Bb-C, or even C-D-E-F#-G-Ab-Bb-C.</p><p>Apparently you haven&apos;t studied the history of these things enough, for if you had you&apos;d realize that you have various possibilities in which the seventh might be derived from  disjunct tetrachord thinking, not from the harmonic series, or from the harmonic series, or from a specifically meantone compromise, etc.</p></div>
