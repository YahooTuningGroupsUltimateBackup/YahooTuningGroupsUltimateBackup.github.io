If the<br/> quintet could somehow learn to play in 12tet, the sound would be so rough<br/> by comparison that probably many people would fail to identify them as a<br/> brass group at all upon hearing a recording.</p><p> -Carl &gt;&gt;</p><p>Instrumental identities are extremely robost under any tuning; the Kolisch<br/>Quartet played consciously in 12tet and no one would ever get the idea that<br/>they were anything other than a string quartet.  Contrary to your viewpoint,<br/>it is when instruments with harmonic spectra use an exact harmonic (as<br/>opposed to subharmonic) JI  that the identities of the individual instruments<br/>are masked or blended into the composite sound.</p></div>
