As far as composing with/away from an instrument, I<br/>see it as neither an advantage or disadvantage...I think the creative<br/>process manifests itself differently with different folks...to try to<br/>work outside of one&apos;s usual framework, of course, is a creative<br/>suggestion in itself. To me, each time I work with a new tuning, I&apos;m<br/>forcing myself out of my usual boxes...but, the way a person pushes<br/>themselves to move forward can be infinite, and what works for one<br/>composer may be totally irrelevant to another. Since I crave the<br/>unknown, that in itself is a great motivator for me...if I hear myself<br/>repeating old ideas, I think it&apos;s stinky, and begin looking for<br/>something unexplored. I hope I can do that till I drop...<br/>    I would be delighted to see others here talk about how they<br/>stimulate their creativity...it&apos;s a process central to any act of<br/>creation, but rarely discussed...what gets your mojo workin&apos;, tuning<br/>guys/girls...?  Hstick  PS...oh yeah...I know that folks like<br/>Debussy/Ravel (and I&apos;m sure many others), would write, say, for piano,<br/>then later, orchestrate these pieces for a larger ensemble. I can hear<br/>that with a lot of my pieces, but do not have the orchestrating choppos<br/>to pull it off...it&apos;s a project I would like to pursue someday, with a<br/>collaborator...of course, Bach often did that, taking works from one<br/>realm, and re-writing them for another. I think very nice things can<br/>happen with this process, sheding new light on the inner workings of a<br/>piece. In fact, I don&apos;t necessarily think of my pieces as &quot;guitar&quot;<br/>pieces...that is my axe, of course, and the medium I&apos;m comfortable<br/>with...I wouldn&apos;t mind at all to hear my music rearranged, and performed<br/>on other instruments...</p></div><h3><a id=20125 href="#20125">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/11/2001 6:53:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20124.html#20124">/tuning/topicId_20124.html#20124</a></p><p>Yer so right, Neil Haverstick!  We be on a composition roll!</p><p>Anyway, as to the idea of &quot;stimulation,&quot; it is indeed a valuable<br/>question... maybe a little OT, but since ALL the composers on this<br/>list are xenharmonicists, maybe it&apos;s NOT so OT!</p><p>For me, composing is a kind of natural process.  If it weren&apos;t, I<br/>doubt I would do it.  There sure is no money in it..  :)  (at least<br/>the kind of stuff *I* generally like to do.)</p><p>I just start hearing things and want to compose.  It&apos;s a PHYSICAL<br/>thing, like getting hungry or wanting to go to  (whoops, don&apos;t go<br/>there...)</p><p>But, really, it&apos;s PHYSICAL, and frankly there are some days I can<br/>compose superbly, some days average, and a few days here and there<br/>when I can&apos;t compose at all.  Those are the &quot;scary&quot; ones, since I<br/>like thinking of myself as a composer!  Fortunately, I maybe get one<br/>of those days once in every two weeks or so.</p><p>I try to compose every night.  The consistency is important to me.<br/>(OK... well I guess I don&apos;t do Saturday nights right now... but I<br/>actually DID at one point...)</p><p>OH... as an aside, I generally can&apos;t compose in the morning.  Even<br/>the afternoon is not so great.  Only after 6PM is my &quot;body&quot; into the<br/>process in a physical way.  It sounds really peculiar, but that&apos;s the<br/>way it works.  If I had all day to compose, I probably wouldn&apos;t do<br/>anything until the evenings.</p><p>HOWEVER, my PHYSICAL perception of the sounds varies according to my<br/>&quot;mood&quot; as I discussed above.  I&apos;ve thought about this in some detail,<br/>and I have decided that the difference is that on a &quot;good&quot; composing<br/>night the sounds ACTUALLY MEAN MORE to me than on &quot;mediocre&quot; nights.</p><p>On a &quot;mediocre&quot; night I might even get something more &quot;elaborate&quot;<br/>going on, but it&apos;s generally junk.  That&apos;s what assures me that many<br/>of the &quot;convoluted&quot; composers out there really can&apos;t hear anything<br/>and try to work their way out of it....</p><p>Generally speaking, this kind of &quot;battering ram&quot; method of<br/>composition doesn&apos;t work for me.  If I have a night when I&apos;m really<br/>&quot;hearing stuff&quot; then the sound really MEANS MORE...  Usually it means<br/>the work is a bit &quot;simpler,&quot; &quot;more colorful,&quot; may I even say<br/>&quot;inspired.&quot;</p><p>HOWEVER, it&apos;s NOTHING that I can CONTROL!  It&apos;s simply a mood or<br/>something coming from inside.  Simply put, I &quot;feel&quot; like composing...</p><p>It sounds idotic, but, believe me, if I don&apos;t really &quot;hear&quot; the<br/>sounds and &quot;feel like&quot; composing in a very deep way, I get REALLY<br/>mediocre results.</p><p>If it EVER turned out that that was the kind of work I was<br/>generating, I would stop.  Fortunately, I have a large enough<br/>background of works that I already have a &quot;profile&quot; so I suppose I<br/>could even do that and still be a &quot;composer,&quot; although I would feel a<br/>bit &quot;sheepish&quot; about it.  I generally never bother to call myself a<br/>&quot;composer&quot; or an &quot;artist&quot; anyway... let OTHER people do that, if they<br/>feel like it.</p><p>Well, there wasn&apos;t too much MATH in this post, but I hope it explains<br/>a bit where MY OWN personal motivation is coming from!!!</p><p>best,</p><p>_______ _____ _____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
