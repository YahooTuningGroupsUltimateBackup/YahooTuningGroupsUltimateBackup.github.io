Maybe &quot;something&quot; I said is getting<br/>&gt; through after all.</p><p>Just wanted to say the same ...</p><p>&gt;&gt;I again will stay to scientific historical methods - trying not<br/>&gt;&gt;to argue from my personal preference.<br/>&gt;&gt;As it is in Latin and very wise: &quot;Sine ira  et studio&quot;</p><p>Seems, that I was not always &quot;sine studio&quot; in this discussion,<br/>but I didn&apos;t claim to be wise, anyway.</p><p>&gt; It is understood that this has been a big issue in your<br/>&gt; academic life.<br/>&gt; And that now, with a dissertation deadline looming,<br/>&gt; you want everyone to learn your lesson.</p><p>It is not understood.<br/>The &quot;academic life&quot; doesn&apos;t interest me at all as a end in<br/>itself, except as much as it provides the possibilities and<br/>ressources to carry out research (hopefully). Otherwise<br/>&quot;academic life&quot; is too often rooster fight and packed with fat<br/>and slow bureaucracies (Not that I don&apos;t see the of a<br/>administrative environment). One wonders often, how research<br/>still can be done.  &quot;Academic&quot; or not; I do not care for such a<br/>categorization and I do not respect degrees/positions as an end<br/>in itself. If I could do my work without the requirements to get<br/>a degree &quot;a title&quot; I&apos;d do it. Actually most of my background<br/>came from the time, when I was not affiliated to any academic institution at all.<br/>And I definitely don&apos;t want that anyone should learn &quot;my lesson&quot;<br/>and deadlines have nothing to do at all with that. I&apos;m working in a small niche , not regarded by many people as being<br/>important. And everyone could read what I wrote about scepticism<br/>to one&apos;s own work. I can contribute only with the knowledge, so<br/>far I have had possibility to accumulate it.  As soon as new<br/>evidence pops up, verifying, modifying or falsifying me, I&apos;ll<br/>take it in.  In this respect, discussions like this help my<br/>research work - claryfing my thoughts. (In any case thanks to<br/>you and everyone taking part)</p><p>&gt; I agree, no apologies are necessary.  Your careful responses<br/>&gt; more than make up for your passionate piques.  After<br/>&gt; printing out &quot;Looong&quot; (oops, did I have enough &quot;o&apos;s<br/>&gt; in Looong&quot;?),</p><p>How should I know, as you know already, I can&apos;t count to three.</p><p>&gt; I quite enjoyed the hard hitting reach from the old<br/>&gt; Teutonic traditions.</p><p>And I have great respect for the scientific traditions of<br/>&quot;Uncle-sam&quot;, when they are applied ...<br/>But actually I don&apos;t care at all about such nationalistic or<br/>patriotic attributes, as it has nothing to do with the methods<br/>applied.</p><p>&gt; It serves well as a pre-edit.  But Jon Szanto is correct,<br/>&gt; I do not agree with Ibo&apos;s assumptions.</p><p>Would be nice if you would agree to those many parts, where it<br/>was simple (?) &quot;positivistic&quot; facts.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I still don&apos;t see your exploring an area of &quot;musical<br/>&gt;&gt;scholarship&quot; - and it didn&apos;t get precisely less murky<br/>&gt;&gt;by the many smaller and larger mistakes.</p><p>&gt; True.  You didn&apos;t hear any of the concerts.  You cannot<br/>&gt; test my ear.  You cannot test my results in sound.</p><p>(See my previous mail today)</p><p>&gt; Whether there is any &quot;scholarship&quot; involved in what I do<br/>&gt; in making these concerts happen is perhaps debatable.</p><p>I agree and have stated that before (in diffeent places,<br/>different words):  scholarship or science are  not necessarily<br/>part of a performance. More so, most of the time they are not,<br/>or even shouldn&apos;t.<br/>In our science, we often can&apos;t deliver just one result: It is<br/>often two possiblities, or a bunch of possiblities, or an &quot;area&quot;<br/>which can only be defined by narrowing in from the possible<br/>knowledge. And of course, it happens that scientists are wrong.<br/>We all do this or that mistake, sometimes sloppiness comes in<br/>too (and I&apos;m a good example for that).</p><p>But performance is &quot;practice&quot;, it is an actual situation, in<br/>which the &quot;scientific&quot; knowledge often can&apos;t be applied, because<br/>you have to come to a decision, what to do in a given moment.<br/>The scientific &quot;May be&quot; must be turned in a musical &quot;It is&quot; at<br/>that moment.  In the next performance your decision might change<br/>due to varying circumstances.</p><p>And I think a lot of what we disagreed on (really or virtually)<br/>has to do, that we didn&apos;t figure this out, first.</p><p>&gt; But the accuracy we reach is recorded for all to hear.  Keep<br/>&gt; in mind that the Brandenburg Concerto #2 concert was only<br/>&gt; last March 29th.  I could certainly send out an example.</p><p>&gt; Btw, it is not possible to hear a continuo and give just<br/>&gt; relationships to the continuo notes in the Brandenburg<br/>&gt; Concerti.  They are way too fast, as is most of Bach.</p><p>How to deal with the question of &apos;running basses&apos; is adressed in<br/>   sources on continuo-playing. And in-between-situations will<br/>occur of course and make the execution even more prone to<br/>deviations.</p><p>&gt; So, your surmise doesn&apos;t match the music.  This I have<br/>&gt; experienced repeatedly on &quot;free intonating&quot; wind<br/>&gt; instruments.  There is a tuning and we are playing it.</p><p>Claim!   Proof?  Will you publish an article with the exact<br/>measurements during a performance?</p><p>&gt; Most distressing at times is your tendency to judge a cover<br/>&gt; by a previously read book. ;-)  You don&apos;t know, so in your<br/>&gt; pique, you flex your muscles.  I&apos;m less inclined to follow<br/>&gt; suit.  I think you can eventually understand where I<br/>&gt; am coming from, but you will probably need to get your<br/>&gt; degree first.</p><p>Don&apos;t you have it cheaper? The reader is referred to my above<br/>statement, showing my view of &quot;academic life&quot; and degrees.</p><p>&gt; Once you feel comfortable with your credentials, you may<br/>&gt; once again be open to new ideas coming from different<br/>&gt; angles.</p><p>Thanks for your allowance. As soon as I need a taskmaster I&apos;ll<br/>send a mail.</p><p>&gt; Since I am not a scientist, and do now acquire to become<br/>&gt; one, you may consider that musical intelligence through<br/>&gt; performing is a legitimate avenue for discovery</p><p>of your or &quot;modern&quot; performance conditions  (and I highly<br/>respect that attempt, as I now often stated), but</p><p>&gt; early performance practices.</p><p>  can from that view be approached, when</p><p>- using instruments the composer has used, or is<br/>  at least likely to have used<br/>- using playing techniques, as close as we can<br/>  come to<br/>- evaluating carefully and as much as possible archival<br/>  and printed matter about the respective time, musical<br/>  culture, thoughts</p><p>And since we have only a small part of evidence left from the<br/>past it is already difficult to judge from the performance (with<br/>all the possible prerequisites taken in account) what might be<br/>&quot;historical&quot; or what is &quot;modern&quot; it.  We can&apos;t escape our<br/>present day - not by any means. And that is in my view the<br/>reason why &quot;historically informed performance practice&quot; is<br/>always a modern thing.</p><p>By &quot;past&quot; I mean any past, how distant it might be in time: if<br/>you give all possible evidence (papers, reports, documents,<br/>sound recordings) to a group of historian and ask  for an<br/>&quot;exact&quot; reconstruction, you will probalbly have a hard time, to<br/>recognize yourself in the results. Not because the scientific<br/>methods are not applied correctly, but because the evidence is<br/>so scarce.  The more pieces of the mosaique will be take in<br/>account, the more likely the original picture can be<br/>reconstructed (and even then pieces might find their way to the<br/>wrng place by misinterpretation or alck of information)</p><p>Leaving out one of the three sketched points will reduce your<br/>available mosaiqe-pieces of the puzzle so much, that the<br/>historical reconstruction has way less probability. However, you<br/>might come to some correct conclusin by chance, but how would<br/>you judge? From your &quot;good taste&quot;, &quot;experience&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I can say now that if I can do<br/>&gt; something, it was doable, and imaginable by Bach.</p><p>May be to the degree I sketched, if you work taking all<br/>available knowlegde and that is already a fiction for all of us.<br/>And what is &quot;imaginable by Bach&quot; we can&apos;t know, especially not<br/>if we think about him as a &quot;genius&quot;: who would claim today for<br/>himself to be such a &quot;genius&quot; that s/he could imagine something<br/>as  Bach wuld have done?</p><p>If you find out that something works on a modern oboe, it might<br/>not be playable on the baroque oboe, and vice versa.<br/>From tools (instruments) which are not representative for the<br/>music you are playing, you can&apos;t draw valid conclusions about a<br/>historical situation.  And that invalidity includes, that your<br/>way of performing can (and I wish so) have an artistic value to<br/>us today.</p><p>&gt; And yes, he does stand out from other German composers of<br/>&gt; his period... imho.</p><p>Who couldn&apos;t ;-)</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; you have been dismissive<br/>&gt;&gt;May be: The german saying is. &quot;As you shout into the woods,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and condescending.<br/>&gt;&gt;... so it will echo back.<br/>&gt;&gt;But I would not have been that, if you would show any sign of<br/>&gt;&gt;- distance to your topic,</p><p>&gt; S&apos;funny, there was over 20 years distance before I announced<br/>&gt; my opinions to this list, since I had written my masters<br/>&gt; thesis at Columbia.  But we are shouting past each other,<br/>&gt; unfortunately.</p><p>Of course distance must not mean &quot;distance of time&quot; - It was<br/>just in other words:</p><p>&gt;&gt;- appropriate scientific scepticism not only to my research<br/>&gt;&gt;   which I welcome, but also to your work</p><p>&gt; If you have never heard my results, and I am right, where<br/>&gt; does that put my scepticism?</p><p>The question is justified. I will answer it, as soon as you<br/>deliver inevitable proof, that your conclusions of the<br/>historical conditions as derived from your modern performances<br/>are &quot;right&quot;.<br/>How exactly do you intend to find the missing information to<br/>integrate in your performances (maybe in the magnitude of 99%,<br/>since certainly most of historical sources on performannces and<br/>their circumstances are lost)?</p><p>If I only think about much of the compositions from the 1960s,<br/>which included taped recordings. As soon as the plastic has<br/>corroded and the technology will not work anymore, the<br/>reconstruction work will begin. In one century from now,<br/>probably way earlier, you&apos;ll have the same situation for Kagel,<br/>Stockhausen, Berio and others. What will musicians make out<br/>their concep&aring;ts, what material will musicologist still have to<br/>conclude from about such music.</p><p>It is fiction to think, that the composer&apos;s intention can be<br/>found back by performance.</p><p>&gt; My scepticism is reserved<br/>&gt; for the status quo.  This means an American status quo,<br/>&gt; since your&apos;s is a bit different.  Americans know<br/>&gt; even less about Werckmeister than Europeans.</p><p>The geographical origin of valid or accepted methods is<br/>irrelevant. If a applicable method will be delivered by<br/>inhabitants on Mars, showing the same results here, than I<br/>certainly will not call it Marsian.</p><p>&gt;&gt;- a wish to take the efforts needed, like learning the<br/>&gt;&gt;   language[s] relevant for the topic you are dealing with,</p><p>&gt; Actually, I do speak German, feeling quite comfortable<br/>&gt; traveling in Germany.<br/>&gt; And I did pass my German and French translation requirements.</p><p>Great, I feel surpassed! I have no degree in German .-), neither in French (some of which I can read through half-lost latin and<br/>pidgin-french).<br/>What I questioned, how you could rely or check any of the<br/>sources or what others tell you about them, without being deeply<br/>rooted in German.  How can you rely on translators, without<br/>double-checking?  I definitely didn&apos;t want to insult, but I<br/>admit, that I didn&apos;t believe that you had any knowledge of<br/>German (and related languages), when I read your firm statements<br/>about alleged Dutch in Werckmeister and the too fast drawn<br/>conclusion from the wrong understanding of Mattheson&apos;s list of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s publications, plus the Walther-readings.</p><p>&gt; My family did not permit my study of German before college.<br/>&gt; Still, I studied German first while in High School for<br/>&gt; several months only.  There may be some psycho-analytic<br/>&gt; difficulty in my spelling of German place names that require<br/>&gt; either diacriticals or formalized substitutions.<br/>&gt; Regardless, there is something called Netiquette: one<br/>&gt; should not criticize spelling in e-mail<br/>&gt; posts...it is not polite, and in your case, hardly necessary.</p><p>Sorry, but you started the refined &quot;psycho-analytical arguments&quot;<br/>directed towards me.</p><p>And concerning the &quot;correct&quot; spelling:<br/>it is not a question of nettiquette:<br/>- there are standards accepted for replacing letters, mainly<br/>  so called Umlaut, and also for diacritical signs (which we<br/>  don&apos;t have in German).  With this standards many<br/>  misunderstandings can be avoided from the beginning.<br/>  So the initial mix of Groeningen and Groningen could have<br/>  been avoided,  and<br/>- searching for info gets more reliable and user-friendly:<br/>  A user, searching for info about Groeningen or Praetorius<br/>  will not find it in your mails and we certainly agree,<br/>  that you might have to tell something, worth reading which<br/>  should be available as long as this electronic dust exists.<br/>  Personally, I don&apos;t want to waste my time with searching<br/>  in 1000s of mails or other documents, forced to<br/>  think of &quot;how could anyone get it wrong&quot; in order<br/>  to find the info.</p><p>And about living persons ? Yes, there I agree with you, that it<br/>is a question of netiquette to use the right spelling. But that<br/>didn&apos;t occur.</p><p>So much for the nettiquette and necessities which you require<br/>rightly.</p><p>&gt;&gt;- interest and drive to find something yourself, even if it<br/>&gt;&gt;   might go beyond your preset conception. I mean it might be,<br/>&gt;&gt;   that you find something than confirms you, and I would<br/>&gt;&gt;   support that - but you might also find things which contradict<br/>&gt;&gt;   you</p><p>&gt; Well, my whole life has been an example of imagining preset<br/>&gt; conceptions.  For<br/>&gt; example, this week we are doing the final tweaks on the<br/>&gt; Charles Ives &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; which I realized from<br/>&gt; extant sketches. (Finally, after 3 years of the recording<br/>&gt; project.)</p><p>Sounds like a great project.    My congratulations!</p><p>&gt;&gt;If you want to work in science you have to accept</p><p>&gt; I want to present great music.  That&apos;s what I do.</p><p>We agree again!</p><p>&gt; Music has more power when it is performed in the<br/>&gt; intonation that is intended by the composer.</p><p>I agree - to the degree of our possible knowledge.<br/>Unfortunately, this possible knowledge is way too scarce (for<br/>example regarding Bach).</p><p>&gt; You guess</p><p>Yes, you know, that&apos;s what so many think of research like mine.<br/> think I can live with that.   You on the contrary are of<br/>course    the one who has the reliable, veryfied information.</p><p>&gt; and mix tunings because you have rationalized<br/>&gt; that no one knows, can make the differences, or really<br/>&gt; has the depth of research and insight that you do.</p><p>Please tell me, if I can help you misunderstanding me even more<br/>(if that could be possible - I doubt).<br/>I know many people (and there are certainly more) who have<br/>better insight, more knowledge about music history, Bach, Buxtehude  etc. than me (quite many American researchers among<br/>them, becasue it doesn&apos;t play a role where someone comes from or<br/>where he is doing his research, if it&apos;s done well).<br/>But that&apos;s not precisely those, who judge from their personal<br/>preferences and come to &quot;safe&quot; conclusions what a composer&apos;s<br/>intentions were. And when they formulate hypothesises they will<br/>not sell them as mere facts.</p><p>&gt; I have found things in the music that is performed in<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III that sets it apart from paper tunings<br/>&gt; or later tunings.</p><p>hmm - good argument!<br/>But correct me, if I&apos;m wrong: Wasn&apos;t Werckmeister III published<br/>in his time always on paper (and furtheron until the computer<br/>age)? Parchment wasn&apos;t used in his time anymore (may be one<br/>could find medieval &quot;parchment tunings&quot;!)</p><p>What exactly are paper tunings by others as opposed to<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s (several) paper temperaments?</p><p>Or, if you regard Werckmeister III, despite it&apos;s being rendered<br/>on paper, not as a paper tuning, what about the other<br/>Werckmeister temperaments, especially the one for &quot;regular<br/>modos&quot; in 1/3rd-p.c.<br/>And also Bendeler&apos;s temperaments? - Bendeler, who was a known<br/>friend and colleague of Werckmeister. Why are those paper<br/>temperaments, while Werckmeister III only should not?</p><p>&gt; It is now late.  I hope to present my idea</p><p>&quot;my idea&quot;: that&apos;s a perfect and valid approach to which I agree,<br/>as you make clear that it is not to be claimed as Bach&apos;s idea,<br/>because we can&apos;t know it (and neither of us could speak for him).</p><p>And:  Herbert Anton Kellner&apos;s life long experience lets him speak with greatest conviction that Bach&apos;s temperament is<br/>Kellner&apos;s 1/5-p.c.temperament, too.</p><p>I wonder who of both of you will be finally able to prove that<br/>just his concept (or may be &quot;his just concept&quot;) is the one and<br/>only, and that Bach actually applied it.</p><p>Anyway, I recommend to try and to use Kellner&apos;s temperament,<br/>too. It has, however, no historical record proving it to be<br/>Bach&apos;s temperament - like Werckmeister III.</p><p>&quot;Kellner-Bach&quot; is &quot;practical&quot;, sounds on many instruments well.<br/>and easy to adjust, also easy to change.  One advantage is that<br/>  tempered fifths are way better in &quot;Kellner&quot;, than<br/>Werckmeister-III-fifths (even worse than meantone fifths).</p><p>Kellner&apos;s method of beat rate proportion is also practical,<br/>however beat proportions can&apos;t be shown to have played a role in<br/> any historical record I have seen, so far (may be Kellner has<br/>still some unedited historical info, which might prove his case).</p><p>&gt; of Bach&apos;s use of particular intervals</p><p>which also is on paper<br/>May be therefore we couldd use your terminology:<br/>&quot;Bach&apos;s paper intervals&quot; and &quot;Werckmeister&apos;s paper tunings&quot;</p><p>&gt; as a source of Bach&apos;s expectation that certain interval<br/>&gt; distinctions would appear between particular keys of<br/>&gt; the keyboard.</p><p>And who knows and proves what expectation Bach exactly had in<br/>mind, as Bach didn&apos;t leave the tiniest hint on this?</p><p>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Kind regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p></div>
