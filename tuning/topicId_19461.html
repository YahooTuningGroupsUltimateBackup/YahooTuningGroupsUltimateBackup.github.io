With due caution, he<br/>presents the attractive hypothesis that composers such as Binchois and<br/>the young Guillaume Dufay around 1420 _may_ have been influenced by<br/>this tuning in their vocal compositions.</p><p>In one _possible_ kind of flexible intonation which I approximate with<br/>a Pythagorean keyboard system of 15 or 16 notes (Gb-G# or Gb-D#),<br/>performers might lean toward regular Pythagorean major thirds and<br/>sixths in cadential progressions (M3-5, M6-8), but toward schisma<br/>thirds and sixths for prolonged noncadential sonorities of a kind<br/>often prominently featured in both vocal and keyboard music of the<br/>time.</p><p>The only comma involved in this kind of distinction is the Pythagorean<br/>comma between two differently spelled notes in the regular chain of<br/>fifths, for example A3-C#4-F#4 as a cadential sonority expanding to<br/>G3-D4-G4 vs. A3-Db4-E4 as a &quot;schisma third&quot; sonority. This seems more<br/>analogous to me to the diesis of a regular meantone tuning, also<br/>arising between notes in the regular tuning chain such as C#-Db, than<br/>to the kind of syntonic comma issues involved in a system combining<br/>pure vertical ratios of 3 and 5 and using only integer ratios for<br/>melodic intervals also (as in the syntonic diatonic, as opposed to<br/>Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI system based on meantone).</p><p>In short, while someone else may have proposed &quot;pitch drift&quot; as a<br/>feature of music by Binchois or other composers of the early to middle<br/>15th century, this is not my theory, nor I am aware of it as a<br/>consequence of the kinds of modified Pythagorean outlook which Lindley<br/>or I have suggested.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
