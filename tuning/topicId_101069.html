I am currently writing a composition for the Fokker organ in 31-TET, and the software attached is currently only supporting this format. However, it can likely be extended (within limits) to other formats. The provided Kontakt script already supports dynamic tunings for arbitrary temperaments at cent precision (higher precision possible in principle, but MIDI CC messages have no higher resolution).</p><p>Attached is a Sibelius 7 script (should also work in Sibelius 6) that automatically inserts MIDI tuning information into a score for 31-TET playback. Supported accidentals are quarter tones, semitones, double-semitone accidentals and their usual combinations. All these accidentals are reasonably supported in Sibelius (e.g., transposition is supported).</p><p>I do the 31-TET playback on a single MIDI channel, which is constantly retuned via MIDI CC messages. Using CC messages on only a single MIDI channel instead of pitch bends has the advantage that polyphonic instruments can be tuned and played on a single channel, and other MIDI channels are free for other instruments. For playback I am using Kontakt because its tuning can be changed programmatically via a Kontakt script. Attached is also a Kontakt script with does exactly that.</p><p>If you do not have Kontakt and only write for monophonic instruments, then the Sibelius script can be easily amended by replacing all generated CC messages with the corresponding pitch bend messages.</p><p>Installation and usage (only explained for Mac OS):</p><p>* Sibelius script</p><p>Copy the attached Sibelius script 31TET_Midi.plg into the directory ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avid/Sibelius\ 7/Plugins/Playback/ (or where ever you have the Sibelius scripts). Start/restart Sibelius. Configure some playback option using Kontakt (see documentation of Playback Devices). Select the notes you want to micro-tune (always all parts of wholes bars are processed). Run the script 31TET_Midi.plg (in the tab play, under Plug-ins). Hidden (grey) MIDI messages will be added to all notes in the selection.
