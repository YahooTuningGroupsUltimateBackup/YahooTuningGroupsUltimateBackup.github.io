In the case of 5/4, for example, if the<br/>approximation is a hair off of pure, it&apos;s going to put a spotlight<br/>on the very fourth and fifth partials that are part of the<br/>5/4 identity. If they slowly &quot;chorus&quot;, or do that creamy thing,<br/>you know what I mean, you still have an interval which sounds like<br/>a 5/4 because you have slow and soft movement in the same key<br/>spot where there is near-stillness in a pure 5/4. (Even in a pure<br/>5/4 the is no perfect stillness in this spot unless everything is<br/>perfectly in phase, for example with digital synthesis, and of course<br/>no perfect stillness throughout all partials and all pitch ranges)</p><p>But as you move away from the pure interval, you start getting rough<br/>weather in the same spot there once was calm- if calmness is part<br/>of the identity of 5/4, how can you say that an interval that<br/>is not calm is an approximation of 5/4? It&apos;s jumping up and down<br/>and waving its arms declaring that it is NOT 5/4. It&apos;s a thing<br/>unto itself.</p><p>Tempering yet further, it&apos;s possible to hit other spots with similar<br/>key characteristics. This is what the Lucy third for example lives,<br/>in my opinion. At 56/45 there&apos;s another tiny &quot;soft&quot; region, so it&apos;s<br/>5/4-like in that way. But it doesn&apos;t have the directness or<br/>vigor or whatever it is of the 5/4, so once again it&apos;s not an<br/>approximation, it&apos;s a thing unto itself.</p><p>I believe, by the way, that all this stuff is why, leaving aside<br/>philosophical and semantic issues, heavy tempering is often<br/>musically superior to mild tempering.</p><p>&gt;That Lucy *chooses* not to view it as an<br/>&gt; approximation means that his tuning is not a temperament,<br/>&gt; and so not a meantone temperament.  If he chose to view it a<br/>&gt; different way the problem of nomenclature would be solved.</p><p>Notation is a different story. In my opinion, if there&apos;s a<br/>historical, or simple, or both, way to notate, even if it&apos;s<br/>all wrong as far generating principles, it should be used<br/>(I use 34 equal notation with additional + and - signs for<br/>example).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A unilateral declaration that 381 cents is an approximation<br/>&gt; &gt; to 5/4 just won&apos;t fly by me, though if it were dictated to be<br/>&gt; &gt; an approximation of 56/45, then we could start talking about<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;philosophical&quot; obstacles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What difference would it make?</p><p>Big difference- I wouldn&apos;t be able to argue that 381 cents<br/>isn&apos;t percieved of as 56/45 (have to check if I can even<br/>differentiate them blind), for I simply don&apos;t know and<br/>probably never will whether it is or not, wereas I can and do<br/>argue that it is not an approximation of 5/4 for the<br/>admittedly crude and boneheaded reason that it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>like one. Too soft. BTW I&apos;m a fan of 56/45 and the Lucy third.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By the way I suspect that Charles Lucy&apos;s interpretation of<br/>&gt;Harrison&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; basic approach, irrespective of the musical quality of Lucy<br/>&gt;Tuning,<br/>&gt; &gt; is not what Harrison was actually doing. I do use, every day,<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals derived in a way I believe serendipitously corresponds<br/>&gt; &gt; to what Harrison was actually up to, but what tuning theorist<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; even care? :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you have an insight it&apos;d be nice to hear it.</p><p>Right off the bat it&apos;s obvious that Lucy Tuning isn&apos;t what<br/>Harrison was doing. From the wiki:</p><p>&quot;He told me he took a thin ruler equal in length to the smallest<br/>string of his base viol. and divided it as a monochord, by taking<br/>the interval of the major IIId, to that of the VIIIth, as the<br/>diameter of a circle, to its circumference. Then by the divisions on<br/>the ruler applied to that string, he adjusted the frets upon the<br/>neck of the viol. and found the harmony of the consonances so<br/>extremely fine that after a very small and gradual lengthening of<br/>the other strings at the nut, by reason of their greater stiffness<br/>he acquiesced in that manner the placing of the frets.&quot;</p><p>How do get 1200 cents/pi out of that? It&apos;s right there in black<br/>and white- divisions of string length, not of cents.  Monkey with a<br/>bit, with an actual ruler and monochord (okay I used a measuring<br/>tape and fretless guitar)- this gives you an absolutely gorgeous<br/>third a &quot;fat comma&quot; (&quot;quarter tone&quot;) low of 5/4, in keeping with<br/>the original observer&apos;s observation. There are a number of<br/>possibilites from there, most sounding very lovely to my ears, don&apos;t<br/>know which exact road Harrison took.</p><p>None of the possibilities is patentable unless you could find<br/>a very guillible patent office, for they truly are music of the<br/>spheres- whether that&apos;s just numerology or something actually<br/>percievable isn&apos;t the point.

In the case of 5/4, for example, if the &gt; approximation is a hair off of pure, it&apos;s going to put a spotlight<br/>&gt; on the very fourth and fifth partials that are part of the<br/>&gt; 5/4 identity. If they slowly &quot;chorus&quot;, or do that creamy thing,<br/>&gt; you know what I mean, you still have an interval which sounds like<br/>&gt; a 5/4 because you have slow and soft movement in the same key<br/>&gt; spot where there is near-stillness in a pure 5/4. (Even in a pure<br/>&gt; 5/4 the is no perfect stillness in this spot unless everything is &gt; perfectly in phase, for example with digital synthesis, and of course<br/>&gt; no perfect stillness throughout all partials and all pitch ranges)</p><p>So they don&apos;t sound the same.</p><p>&gt; But as you move away from the pure interval, you start getting rough &gt; weather in the same spot there once was calm- if calmness is part<br/>&gt; of the identity of 5/4, how can you say that an interval that<br/>&gt; is not calm is an approximation of 5/4? It&apos;s jumping up and down<br/>&gt; and waving its arms declaring that it is NOT 5/4. It&apos;s a thing<br/>&gt; unto itself. Yes, that&apos;s the sound of &quot;approximation&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Tempering yet further, it&apos;s possible to hit other spots with similar &gt; key characteristics. This is what the Lucy third for example lives,<br/>&gt; in my opinion. At 56/45 there&apos;s another tiny &quot;soft&quot; region, so it&apos;s<br/>&gt; 5/4-like in that way. But it doesn&apos;t have the directness or<br/>&gt; vigor or whatever it is of the 5/4, so once again it&apos;s not an &gt; approximation, it&apos;s a thing unto itself. You&apos;ll have to write a proper introduction of your key characteristics because I don&apos;t know what to make of it from these brief mentions.  It doesn&apos;t relate to anything else I&apos;ve heard of.</p><p>&gt; I believe, by the way, that all this stuff is why, leaving aside &gt; philosophical and semantic issues, heavy tempering is often &gt; musically superior to mild tempering. So you accept the concept of heavy tempering?</p><p>&gt;&gt;That Lucy *chooses* not to view it as an &gt;&gt;approximation means that his tuning is not a temperament, &gt;&gt;and so not a meantone temperament.  If he chose to view it a &gt;&gt;different way the problem of nomenclature would be solved.<br/>&gt; &gt; Notation is a different story. In my opinion, if there&apos;s a &gt; historical, or simple, or both, way to notate, even if it&apos;s<br/>&gt; all wrong as far generating principles, it should be used<br/>&gt; (I use 34 equal notation with additional + and - signs for &gt; example).</p><p>What does notation have to do with anything?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;A unilateral declaration that 381 cents is an approximation<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;to 5/4 just won&apos;t fly by me, though if it were dictated to be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;an approximation of 56/45, then we could start talking about<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;philosophical&quot; obstacles. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;What difference would it make?<br/>&gt; &gt; Big difference- I wouldn&apos;t be able to argue that 381 cents<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t percieved of as 56/45 (have to check if I can even &gt; differentiate them blind), for I simply don&apos;t know and &gt; probably never will whether it is or not, wereas I can and do<br/>&gt; argue that it is not an approximation of 5/4 for the<br/>&gt; admittedly crude and boneheaded reason that it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; like one.

A scale is an ordered pitch set, an abstraction &gt;&gt; of a set of pitches used for melody/harmony.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; But before you said he said the temperament had to be &gt; irrational.  Now you&apos;ve dropped that condition.  Which &gt; definition do you prefer?<br/>&gt;   Now you&apos;re looking for nits.

There are musicians on this list, not just theorists or mathematicians.</p><p>Actually, judging from message volume these days, we are looking at *internal* relations, not public relations.</p><p>&gt; Gene&apos;s site does a good job of defining things for &gt; mathematicians.  0.01% of a global population of 6 billion &gt; is, what, 600,000?  That&apos;s not a bad audience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Like I said, it&apos;s all fine and good, but don&apos;t expect it to be the colloquial.

In the case of 5/4, for example, if the<br/>&gt; &gt; approximation is a hair off of pure, it&apos;s going to put a<br/>spotlight<br/>&gt; &gt; on the very fourth and fifth partials that are part of the<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/4 identity. If they slowly &quot;chorus&quot;, or do that creamy thing,<br/>&gt; &gt; you know what I mean, you still have an interval which sounds<br/>like<br/>&gt; &gt; a 5/4 because you have slow and soft movement in the same key<br/>&gt; &gt; spot where there is near-stillness in a pure 5/4. (Even in a pure<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/4 the is no perfect stillness in this spot unless everything<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; perfectly in phase, for example with digital synthesis, and of<br/>course<br/>&gt; &gt; no perfect stillness throughout all partials and all pitch<br/>ranges)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So they don&apos;t sound the same.</p><p>No, they sound approximately the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But as you move away from the pure interval, you start getting<br/>rough<br/>&gt; &gt; weather in the same spot there once was calm- if calmness is part<br/>&gt; &gt; of the identity of 5/4, how can you say that an interval that<br/>&gt; &gt; is not calm is an approximation of 5/4? It&apos;s jumping up and down<br/>&gt; &gt; and waving its arms declaring that it is NOT 5/4. It&apos;s a thing<br/>&gt; &gt; unto itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s the sound of &quot;approximation&quot;.</p><p>No, that&apos;s the sound of &quot;two different intervals&quot;. Is warm<br/>orange approximately cold red? I guess if you&apos;re an<br/>interior decorator with a budget drawn from between the<br/>cushions on the sofa, it is. Or maybe working on<br/>data compression algorithms for mobile telephones or<br/>something.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tempering yet further, it&apos;s possible to hit other spots with<br/>similar<br/>&gt; &gt; key characteristics. This is what the Lucy third for example<br/>lives,<br/>&gt; &gt; in my opinion. At 56/45 there&apos;s another tiny &quot;soft&quot; region, so<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/4-like in that way. But it doesn&apos;t have the directness or<br/>&gt; &gt; vigor or whatever it is of the 5/4, so once again it&apos;s not an<br/>&gt; &gt; approximation, it&apos;s a thing unto itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll have to write a proper introduction of your key<br/>&gt; characteristics because I don&apos;t know what to make of it from<br/>&gt; these brief mentions.  It doesn&apos;t relate to anything else<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve heard of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I believe, by the way, that all this stuff is why, leaving aside<br/>&gt; &gt; philosophical and semantic issues, heavy tempering is often<br/>&gt; &gt; musically superior to mild tempering.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you accept the concept of heavy tempering?</p><p>I accept musical results of heavy tempering, therefore<br/>the act of heavy tempering itself. I don&apos;t accept the<br/>idea that a heavily tempered interval &quot;is&quot; the original,<br/>or is an &quot;approximation&quot; of the original. Heavy tempering<br/>succeeds because it fails. This is nothing new or strange<br/>in music or other arts- for example, at this very moment I&apos;m<br/>listening to my 70s discrete-analog &quot;string machine&quot; (a Logan,<br/>for any buffs, and I got it for a 100 Euros, yeah, baby!).<br/>As an approximation to a string section, it&apos;s pretty sad, and<br/>that&apos;s exactly why it&apos;s a cult classic while &quot;realistic&quot;<br/>string samples get continually outdated and updated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;That Lucy *chooses* not to view it as an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;approximation means that his tuning is not a temperament,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;and so not a meantone temperament.  If he chose to view it a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;different way the problem of nomenclature would be solved.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Notation is a different story. In my opinion, if there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; historical, or simple, or both, way to notate, even if it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; all wrong as far generating principles, it should be used<br/>&gt; &gt; (I use 34 equal notation with additional + and - signs for<br/>&gt; &gt; example).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What does notation have to do with anything?</p><p>Oh, sorry, I read &quot;notation&quot; where Gene had &quot;nomenclature&quot;.<br/>Anyway all this about temperaments does have a lot to do<br/>with notation, but whatever.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;A unilateral declaration that 381 cents is an approximation<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;to 5/4 just won&apos;t fly by me, though if it were dictated to be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;an approximation of 56/45, then we could start talking about<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;philosophical&quot; obstacles.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;What difference would it make?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Big difference- I wouldn&apos;t be able to argue that 381 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; isn&apos;t percieved of as 56/45 (have to check if I can even<br/>&gt; &gt; differentiate them blind), for I simply don&apos;t know and<br/>&gt; &gt; probably never will whether it is or not, wereas I can and do<br/>&gt; &gt; argue that it is not an approximation of 5/4 for the<br/>&gt; &gt; admittedly crude and boneheaded reason that it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; &gt; like one.

Wherever &quot;equal<br/>temperament&quot; is used without specifying either what interval is being<br/>equally divided (or how many parts it&apos;s being divided into), it&apos;s<br/>universally understood to be one specific tuning, 12-EDO.<br/>Likewise, &quot;meantone temperament&quot; has traditionally understood to mean<br/>1/4-comma temperament, which is basically the hang-up I&apos;ve been<br/>having with the terms &quot;temperament&quot; and &quot;meantone&quot; being applied to<br/>what Graham calls &quot;temperament class&quot;.  It would be great<br/>if &quot;temperament&quot; could be extended to refer to classes,<br/>because &quot;tempered tuning&quot; could then be used as a generic term to<br/>refer to a more specific category.</p><p>&quot;Tempered tuning&quot; is such a nice foil to the term &quot;rational tuning&quot;<br/>that I&apos;m now wondering whether the terms &quot;meantone&quot; and &quot;meantone<br/>temperament&quot; (without qualifying language) could indeed become<br/>acceptable in a broader sense.  We&apos;ve had something similar happening<br/>with the term &quot;just intonation&quot; (regarding what&apos;s considered to be JI<br/>in a practical vs. theoretical sense), such that it&apos;s often necessary<br/>to specify &quot;strict JI&quot; to indicate the original (theoretical)<br/>meaning.  (On the one hand we have irrational microtemperaments that<br/>sound like JI and on the other hand rational well-temperaments that<br/>don&apos;t.)  Would &quot;strict meantone&quot; similarly suffice?  That&apos;s a tough<br/>call.  Will everyone outside this group accept that?  Probably not,<br/>so we should be prepared to make allowances for that when discussing<br/>these things with others.</p><p>Gene, thanks for pointing out that &quot;family&quot; is already taken (I<br/>checked Monz&apos;s encyclopedia entry).  Likewise, Herman pointed out<br/>that irregular temperaments would still fall into temperament classes<br/>by virtue of sharing the same mapping from JI.  I&apos;m wondering whether<br/>there&apos;s a single word that would fit the concept of family member,<br/>yet still convey the meaning of class, because I&apos;m still thinking<br/>that extending the term &quot;temperament&quot; to cover temperament class<br/>should be a last resort.  Could &quot;family&quot; be replaced with &quot;clan&quot;<br/>and &quot;temperament class&quot; with &quot;family&quot;?  Or is it better to<br/>leave &quot;family&quot; as is and find a word that would treat members of the<br/>same temperament class as a &quot;litter&quot; (of temperamental pups). :-)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [message #73415]<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; IMO, the most important things which differentiate<br/>&gt; scales from tunings and temperaments is what i put<br/>&gt; in the opening statement on that page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;A succession of musical pitches arranged in order<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; of pitch-height, generally considered as a source set<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; of pitches for musical composition.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scales are always arranged by pitch, and this is<br/>&gt; something which is not necessarily true of either<br/>&gt; of the other two entities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And in fact, that&apos;s been pretty much my whole point<br/>&gt; from the beginning, in my theoretical writings.<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s far easier to understand the harmonic<br/>&gt; properties of a tuning or temperament if the pitches<br/>&gt; are arranged according to some relevant pitch and/or<br/>&gt; interval references (i.e., a tonespace) instead of<br/>&gt; pitch-height.</p><p>When defining seemingly simple term such as &quot;scale&quot;, it often helps<br/>to identify specific examples of the term and then determine what<br/>these have in common (and from that, also what the term is *not*).<br/>Common examples of scales are major, minor, and chromatic (or if<br/>you&apos;re in Java, pelog and slendro).

However a scale does not generally require one particular<br/>tuning.  Thus a major scale is a major scale regardless of whether<br/>it&apos;s played in pythagorean tuning, 12-ET, meantone temperament, 19-<br/>ET, etc., and the definition must take that into account, so as not<br/>to be misleading.

I hope you don&apos;t want a new word to mean what &quot;wedgie&quot; currently means so that it&apos;s more palatable to music students because this is one of the few new terms we actually seem to agree on.</p><p>There are places in the world outside mailing lists and music classrooms, you know.  Wedgies are more likely to be spoken of in mathematics classrooms, or classrooms teaching hybrid mathematics-of-music courses.  &quot;Wedgie&quot; is one of the terms that might not survive the translation into academese because it&apos;s obviously light hearted and there are some academics who don&apos;t like you to be seen having fun.  If it changes, so what?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;These terms have been hijacked, it seems, by tuning-math. I think if you &gt;&gt;&gt;asked &quot;says who&quot;, it would be a small core group of tuning-math folks. &gt;&gt;&gt;That&apos;s it. Fine to keep using this stuff in tuning-math, but don&apos;t &gt;&gt;&gt;expect it to fly untranslated witheveryone else.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Discussions are going to leak out of the boxes you try and &gt;&gt;contain them in.<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course, but what I&apos;m objecting to is people saying, committe-style, &gt; from tuning-math, &apos;the term for that is this&apos;, inventing neologisms, and &gt; then insisting that musicians who have been using say, older &gt; &apos;Barbour-style&apos; terms should be &apos;upgrading&apos;. Or worse yet, that not &gt; using these terms is barbaric. I sense Carl was only half joking when &gt; referring to non tuning-mathers<br/>&gt; as &apos;plebs&apos;.</p><p>Carl uses light-hearted language a lot.  As far as I can tell it isn&apos;t hiding any malice.  You&apos;re also stretching it a bit to associate plebeians with barbarians.  They were in fact Roman citizens -- among the most civilized people of their time.</p><p>Anyway, what terms are you talking about?  It&apos;s a common convention that if you come up with a new concept you get first dibs on naming it.  It happens that some new concepts came about on tuning-math and it would make things simple if you used the tuning-math terms to talk about them.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;A paraphrase of Barbour does the trick for me:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;A tuning, as it is understood out in the &apos;real world&apos; is a rational set &gt;&gt;&gt;of pitches (think the duodene or another such JI set), a temperament is &gt;&gt;&gt;an alteration, or compromise, of one or more JI intervals to create &gt;&gt;&gt;consistent step-sizes. A scale is an ordered pitch set, an abstraction &gt;&gt;&gt;of a set of pitches used for melody/harmony.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;But before you said he said the temperament had to be &gt;&gt;irrational.  Now you&apos;ve dropped that condition.  Which &gt;&gt;definition do you prefer?<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; Now you&apos;re looking for nits. Of course, a temperament is *usually* &gt; irrational---this definition is better, in that, one often finds that a &gt; rational well-temperament fits nicely (I&apos;ve designed one myself, which &gt; George Secor improved slightly.)</p><p>Indeed you have.</p><p>So if you don&apos;t follow Barbour&apos;s simplistic &quot;rational/irrational&quot; definition where exactly do you disagree with which tuning-math definition?  Or is this all hot air?</p><p>&gt;&gt;In the real world I think you&apos;ll find a tuning can be &gt;&gt;irrational.  Otherwise, guitarists would face a logical &gt;&gt;contradiction every time they tried to tune instruments with &gt;&gt;conventionally placed frets.  Chalk that one up as a &gt;&gt;peculiarity of Barbour&apos;s usage.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes---for clarity---one both &apos;tunes a piano&apos;, and &apos;sets a temperament&apos;, &gt; one doesn&apos;t &apos;temper a guitar&apos;, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; Does this need to be said, or are you picking a fight? ;)</p><p>I&apos;m amazed that anybody would put forward Barbour&apos;s definitions as applying in the outside word.  I&apos;m sure he was a clever and learned chap but he was a bit idiosyncratic on this point, wasn&apos;t he?</p><p>I&apos;ll echo Carl -- this thread didn&apos;t start because a tuning-math member objected to an outside definition.  So if Barbour&apos;s alternatives are so obviously wrong, what part of what tuning-math definition is who objecting to?</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re right. But I think it&apos;s important to find a consensus among &gt; musicians as well, since they are presumably the ones playing the music &gt; in the given tuning.<br/>&gt; Should that step come into account? There are musicians on this list, &gt; not just theorists or mathematicians.</p><p>Why would we care what musicians think about the word &quot;homomorphism&quot;?  It&apos;s hardly a neologism, anyway.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Gene&apos;s site does a good job of defining things for &gt;&gt;mathematicians.  0.01% of a global population of 6 billion &gt;&gt;is, what, 600,000?  That&apos;s not a bad audience.<br/>&gt; &gt; Like I said, it&apos;s all fine and good, but don&apos;t expect it to be the &gt; colloquial. These tunings have existed as concepts, after all, well &gt; before the math was even capable of describing them accurately.</p><p>What tunings?  A lot of the temperament classes in Paul&apos;s Middle Path paper weren&apos;t mentioned anywhere before.  Only meantone and 12-equal can have preceded the math to describe them.  And that doesn&apos;t cover 11-limit temperaments which are even less likely to have been investigated before.  I don&apos;t think we ever imposed our own name on a temperament class that had an accepted name.  Given that, do you think our names won&apos;t become the colloquial for those temperament classes?</p><p>&gt; That said, the math is useful---once described, it can be tinkered with &gt; in abstract ways---which is where tuning-math comes in. Whethere or not &gt; it can be translated back into music on a scale of use anything like &gt; what the organic tunings that are &apos;a priori&apos; in use by musicians remains &gt; to be seen.</p><p>It isn&apos;t that difficult to translate it back.  Along the way you lose concepts like wedgies and homomorphisms and a whole lot else.  Getting musicians to listen, and help with the translation, is an entirely different question.  They&apos;d much rather spend their time objecting to technical terms that inadvertantly rear their heads during the discussion.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=73466 href="#73466">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2007 1:33:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That is not saying much  but not true. a bunch of opium addicts poisoning them selves with lead pipes. outside of a military they have left little. name some roman developments in music or scales. outside of Virgil what  is so civilized about them.

Which is just fine.<br/>I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;motives&quot; here, but the historical<br/>motives of tempering you know very well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A unilateral declaration that 381 cents is an approximation<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to 5/4 just won&apos;t fly by me, though if it were dictated to be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an approximation of 56/45, then we could start talking about<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;philosophical&quot; obstacles.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What difference would it make?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Big difference- I wouldn&apos;t be able to argue that 381 cents<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;isn&apos;t percieved of as 56/45 (have to check if I can even<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;differentiate them blind), for I simply don&apos;t know and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;probably never will whether it is or not, wereas I can and do<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;argue that it is not an approximation of 5/4 for the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;admittedly crude and boneheaded reason that it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;like one. Too soft. BTW I&apos;m a fan of 56/45 and the Lucy third.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Why not?  Why can&apos;t it be an approximation of 5:4 *and*<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;56:45?  How could it be an approximation if did sound the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;same?  &quot;Approximate&quot; means close but not the same.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lessee... &quot;approximate&quot;:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. near or approaching a certain state, condition, goal, or<br/>&gt; &gt; standard.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. nearly exact; not perfectly accurate or correct: The<br/>approximate<br/>&gt; &gt; time was 10 o&apos;clock.<br/>&gt; &gt; 3. near; close together.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. very similar; nearly identical.<br/>&gt; &gt; Â–verb (used with object) 5. to come near to; approach closely<br/>to: to<br/>&gt; &gt; approximate an ideal.<br/>&gt; &gt; 6. to estimate: We approximated the distance at three miles.<br/>&gt; &gt; 7. to simulate; imitate closely: The motions of the stars can be<br/>&gt; &gt; approximated in a planetarium.<br/>&gt; &gt; 8. to bring near.<br/>&gt; &gt; Â–verb (used without object) 9. to come near in position,<br/>character,<br/>&gt; &gt; amount, etc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s admirably detailed.  I&apos;ll take 1(b), &quot;approaching a<br/>&gt; .. goal&quot;.  I can also take 1(a), &quot;near a certain ... goal&quot;<br/>&gt; provided you don&apos;t argue that 4 cents isn&apos;t &quot;near&quot;.</p><p>Four cents high or four cents low, in light of which particular<br/>musical characteristics you&apos;re after? Anyway, shall we take<br/>a look at the &quot;middle path&quot; papers and see if the<br/>purported approximations are all within 4 cents of their<br/>stated goals?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Oxford thing that came with my computer has an admirably<br/>&gt; succinct definition for the verb: &quot;come close or be similar<br/>&gt; to something in quality, nature, or quantity&quot;.  So you&apos;re<br/>&gt; talking abut quality and we&apos;re talking about quantity -- or<br/>&gt; maybe a different quality.  (Note that we usually say<br/>&gt; &quot;approximate&quot; as a verb, but you&apos;ve cleverly slided in a<br/>&gt; definition of the adjective, which has some definitions more<br/>&gt; to your liking.)</p><p>Man, a definition of the verb is right there in front of you,<br/>of course I was careful to include it as well. Nor are the<br/>definitions of the adjective and verb contradictory in any way,<br/>in fact one can be gleaned immediately from the other. There are<br/>intelligent and educated people reading this list and<br/>surely there going to wonder why you insist on cladding<br/>yourself in motley.</p><p>Yes of course I&apos;m talking about quality and not quantity, that&apos;s<br/>the whole point.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wasn&apos;t able to find &quot;audibly different&quot; in any online<br/>dictionary,<br/>&gt; &gt; and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll find it in the hardcover at home, either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So which orifice did you pull &quot;audibly different&quot; out of?</p><p>The horse&apos;s mouth, obviously.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
