Kemal Karaosmanoglu<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.musiki.org">www.musiki.org</a></p><p>hello!</p><p>for certain musical purposes, there may indeed be an attempt to find<br/>the &quot;most correct sound system&quot;, in which the pitches and intervals<br/>best reflect the artistic intent of the composer and the sound<br/>dynamics of his or her tonal language. many of my posts have been<br/>along this angle, particularly with respect to western common-<br/>practice repertoire, but also others.</p><p>however, the pitch continuum can be divided in so many different<br/>ways, and some quite disparate ways are already found on various<br/>parts of our planet, so the expansion of creative possibility in the<br/>musical arts is also a prime intention of mine. given a set of<br/>instruments and artistic desiderata (particularly if those involve<br/>harmony or tonality), i enjoy exploring the theoretical possibilities<br/>for systems that would be applicable. even a simple scale has an<br/>overwhelming number of possible intervals, but an instrument must<br/>generally be in tune (or one&apos;s mind in tune with a scale) before the<br/>creative act begins. so of all aspects of musical creation, tuning<br/>tends to be among the most premeditatedly worked out, right up next<br/>to the design of instruments and even notation systems. of course,<br/>there&apos;s no reason one can&apos;t create a tuning or scale completely<br/>intuitively -- it&apos;s just that such a process is less amenable to<br/>description and investigation in ascii text than the more<br/>quantitative methods are, and this is an ascii text list . . .</p><p>hope that helps you get a sense of where i&apos;m coming from with regard<br/>to my intentions -- not to mention my intention to edify and dispel<br/>misconceptions concerning all the areas, for example acoustical and<br/>historical, that surround musical tuning. and, perhaps most of all,<br/>to have my ideas challenged by as many minds as i can get to consider<br/>them.</p><p>regards,<br/>paul</p></div><h3><a id=46809 href="#46809">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2003 12:45:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, M.

In my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; view the issue is not about &grave;correctness&apos; or &grave;incorrectness&apos;;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rather, it is about freedom. What is needed is not a &grave;correct<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; system&apos; but a &grave;transparent system&apos; which will provide freedom<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the confining dominance of an &grave;established system&apos;. In the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; best of all possible worlds, the common language of theory,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; composition, instruments, notation, and education should<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; encompass all possible tunings in a practical, utilitarian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &grave;system&apos; allowing complete aesthetic freedom for all composers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and performers, educators and students alike.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aaron Hunt<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -- -Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; &gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/>&gt; &gt;  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt; &gt;  KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 24<br/>&gt;    Date: Mon, 15 Sep 2003 21:41:32 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:perlich@aya.yale.edu">perlich@aya.yale.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: database of unison-vectors<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; hello all,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i need a very complete database of ratios which<br/>&gt; &gt; may be potential unison-vectors.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i realize that there&apos;s a good 5-limit list on my<br/>&gt; &gt; own &quot;equal-temperaments&quot; Dictionary webpage,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s still in need of revision . . . a slightly more complete and<br/>&gt; correct version of this, which applies better to the graphs on your<br/>&gt; page, is at<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/database">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/database</a>?<br/>&gt; method=reportRows&amp;tbl=10&amp;sortBy=5&amp;sortDir=up<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (be sure to scroll through the various pages)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ((i know you knew but this is for the benefit of new members<br/>&gt; following along))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; by combining a pair of unison vectors from this list, and allowing<br/>&gt; both unison vectors to vanish, you can derive any of a pretty vast<br/>&gt; number of equal temperaments, or well-temperaments if you do the<br/>&gt; tempering unequally . . . the graphs show these equal temperaments at<br/>&gt; the intersections of the lines corresponding to the unison vectors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7-limit and higher are of course of great interest too, but the<br/>&gt; graphs would have to be three-dimensional, and would be pretty<br/>&gt; impossible to view without the ability to rotate them around and view<br/>&gt; them from various angles (hint hint) . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 25<br/>&gt;    Date: Mon, 15 Sep 2003 21:45:55 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:perlich@aya.yale.edu">perlich@aya.yale.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Errors in Michael and Aaron&apos;s recommendations at <a href="http://millersus.com">millersus.com</a> site. - Red Herring?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;For a list of cents offset values from 12-et, check out:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.millersrus.com/avery/">http://www.millersrus.com/avery/</a>&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Useful link provided you don&apos;t mind naming and value errors;-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At least 3 of the 12 values listed for the misnamed &quot;3/10 comma<br/>&gt; &gt; Harrison&quot; are WRONG!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which three? nothing looks seriously wrong to me, though the pitch<br/>&gt; named Ab (in all the tunings, apparently) is actually being tuned as<br/>&gt; G#, which may or may not confuse any particular user.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
