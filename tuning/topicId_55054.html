The result has three 112/75<br/>meantone fifths, a 125000/83349 quasi-pure fifth (it&apos;s flat by an<br/>interval of 250047/250000, which is less than a third of a cent) and<br/>eight pure fifths. As a well-temperament the main problem with it is<br/>that it doesn&apos;t seem to help the thirds much; rearranging the fifths<br/>so that the meantone fifths were in the same part of the chain would<br/>seem to be a good plan if we wanted a well-temperament with sweeter<br/>home keys.</p><p>I also give a 19-note 7-limit pseudo 19-equal which is the Hahn<br/>reduction via the commas of 171-et of a chain of minor thirds. It is<br/>interesting for being rational and having a lot of pure minor thirds.</p><p>! rat12.scl<br/>72-et Hahn reduced 12-fairly-equal well-temperament<br/>12<br/>!<br/>200/189<br/>9/8<br/>25/21<br/>63/50<br/>4/3<br/>625/441<br/>3/2<br/>100/63<br/>42/25<br/>16/9<br/>189/100<br/>2</p><p>! rat19.scl<br/>171-et Hahn reduced 7-limit 19-almost-equal<br/>19<br/>!<br/>28/27<br/>672/625<br/>125/112<br/>125/108<br/>6/5<br/>56/45<br/>1323/1024<br/>75/56<br/>25/18<br/>36/25<br/>112/75<br/>2048/1323<br/>45/28<br/>5/3<br/>216/125<br/>224/125<br/>625/336<br/>27/14<br/>2</p></div>
