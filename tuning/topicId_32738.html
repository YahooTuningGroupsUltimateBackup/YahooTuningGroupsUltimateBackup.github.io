When Joe first raised this issue<br/>a few days ago I was working on a long, detailed post which included<br/>a bit of description of the graphical notation Bill Wesley uses<br/>to perform his improvisations which begin with each hand playing<br/>a different minimalist loop.  Bill&apos;s notation allows one to see<br/>clearly where two distinct melodic loops interlock and separate.</p><p>A big part of the point I was making, and the biggest point<br/>Bill emphasizes, is that notating what he plays in regular<br/>standard notation looks like *crap*.  It doesn&apos;t convey a<br/>real sense of what he&apos;s playing or of what the listener is<br/>hearing.  Therefore, *that* is the most appropriate notation<br/>for what he&apos;s doing, despite its *radical* departure from<br/>standard notation.</p><p>Unfortunately, I thought I saved that post but can&apos;t find it<br/>anywhere on my PC now.</p><p>But there&apos;s good news on the horizon ... Bill is *finally*<br/>getting together a website about his theories and his incredible<br/>instruments.  He plans to link it fully into mine ... so as<br/>soon as his instruments really are in production, the site<br/>should go public and there will be lots of links wherever I<br/>can fit them in.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32803 href="#32803">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2002 6:23:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been blessed to have played with a lot of great musicians over<br/>&gt; the years, but I&apos;ve never played with anyone like Joe and Mat.
