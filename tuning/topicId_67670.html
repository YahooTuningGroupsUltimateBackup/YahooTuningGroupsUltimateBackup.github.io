I have begun updating my microtonalists list at<br/><a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~jstarret/microtonalists.html">http://infohost.nmt.edu/~jstarret/microtonalists.html</a><br/>So far, I have gotten through the E&apos;s, and it takes a lot longer than<br/>I thought it would to update broken links. I haven&apos;t been paying<br/>enough attention to what you have been doing, and I see a lot of new<br/>names here. If you would like to be included in this list, just send<br/>your URL to me at <a href="mailto:jstarret@nmt.edu">jstarret@nmt.edu</a></p><p>Also, if you have a separate page where your compositions can be<br/>heard, I would be glad to link to them on one of my Listen pages,<br/>which should be next in line for update. Next to be fixed will be the<br/>pages on writings about microtonality, then the microtonal instruments<br/>pages, but if you send me something for these areas, I will put them<br/>in right away.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2006 4:27:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John Starrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, if you have a separate page where your compositions can be<br/>&gt; heard, I would be glad to link to them on one of my Listen pages,<br/>&gt; which should be next in line for update.
