Decades later, Mahler&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; remarks to Schoenberg indicate that he was familiar<br/>&gt;&gt; enough with meantone to complain about its replacement<br/>&gt;&gt; with 12edo.</p><p>i just posted the whole quote from Mahler to Schoenberg,<br/>in another message to this list.</p><p>Mahler mentioned that would could not imagine the effect<br/>of the unequal intervals unless one had heard them, so<br/>it&apos;s obvious that he had ... and i simply put 2 and 2<br/>together and reason that since Petzval was at the U. of<br/>Vienna demonstrating 31-edo at exactly the time Mahler<br/>attended, then he must have heard 31-edo then.</p><p>the big question is: exactly where and when was 55-edo<br/>still being used as the tuning paradigm for orchestral<br/>playing?  was Mahler familiar with it at all?</p><p>Mahler had befriended Schoenberg in 1904, and had many<br/>arguments with him over theoretical matters, but<br/>supported Schoenberg&apos;s work in composition right up<br/>to the end of his life. we all know Schoenberg&apos;s ideas<br/>about 12-edo, and how it was supposed to be a tempering<br/>of 11-limit JI ... presumably Mahler picked up some of<br/>this from Schoenberg, and thus, his comments on what<br/>European music had lost as a result of meantone&apos;s<br/>replacement by 12-edo.</p><p>we microtonalists also know that 12-edo is essentially<br/>the same as 1/11-comma meantone ... Mahler specifically<br/>meant a meantone which had two different sized semitones,<br/>which would be all other meantones except 12-edo.</p><p>since the emphasis of Mahler&apos;s comment was on the<br/>different key colorations produced by the unequal<br/>intervals, he was presumably talking about a type of<br/>meantone where the difference between the two sizes<br/>of semitones was fairly large ... this would indicate<br/>something closer to the 19-edo/31-edo end of the meantone<br/>spectrum. in meantones like 43-edo and 55-edo, the<br/>sizes of the semitones are closer, and thus the<br/>different keys would not sound as different.</p><p>also, it must be pointed out that this key-coloration<br/>does not occur if one extends the meantone chain out<br/>far enough to get rid of all the wolves. the chain<br/>has to be stopped at a fairly low cardinality in<br/>order to produce the wolves which produce the different<br/>key colors.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2005 3:07:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>oops, a typo ...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Mahler mentioned that would could not imagine the effect<br/>&gt; of the unequal intervals unless one had heard them, so<br/>&gt; it&apos;s obvious that he had ...</p><p>that should be &quot;Mahler mentioned that one could not imagine ...&quot;</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div>
