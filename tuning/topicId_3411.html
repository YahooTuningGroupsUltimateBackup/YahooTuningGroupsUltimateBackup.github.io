Obviously I&apos;ve had my head a bit too buried in work<br/>&gt;and in my saxophonics.  When did it come out?  The copyright date is 1998.</p><p>TH&amp;H was released along with the complete soundtrack to A Clockwork Orange and Sonic Seasonings in late September.</p><p>Clockwork is good, of course, but probably not worth the money if you already have the original version (as I did).  Sonic Seasonings is a classic (so I&apos;m told), but one that I don&apos;t really care for.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing really bad about TH&amp;H, but nothing really good either.  She&apos;s gone over to sampling, and the music is forced and fragmented.  Tuning is used from a sound POV rather than a conceptual POV.  All in all, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it.</p><p>Although Wendy herself doesn&apos;t agree, Digital Moonscapes is her best album, musically, and sound-wise.  In fact, I submit it as the best solo synthesis ever done.  Beauty in the Beast isn&apos;t far behind, and has the benefit of some wild tuning.</p><p>It hardly surprises me anymore that these two are still out of print, while others get remastered.  BitB is presumably coming out soon, in 20bit, but I&apos;m not aware of plans for DM.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
