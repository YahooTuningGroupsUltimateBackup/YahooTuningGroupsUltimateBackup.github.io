I&apos;m new to this but it seems like the midi standard file has a lot of potential, especially since you can just take a Finale notated score and turn it into a midi file.  I just click the &quot;show playback options&quot; in the &quot;text expression designer dialog box&quot; and set the playback option type to whatever: tempo, pitch bend, etc. &quot;(e.g., 683 for 17&iuml;&iquest;&half;) and walla, . . . all the 17&iuml;&iquest;&half; notes have pitch bend.</p><p>I&apos;m having a little trouble with predicting what instrument will actually play since Finale seems limited to the orchestral &amp; jazz instruments and I understand that there are 128 actual voices with an industry standard of midi channel: 1 being reserved for piano; 10 for drum; and 128 for ocarina . . . at least that&apos;s what it says in James Maguire, &quot;Secrets of the Digital Studio&quot;</p><p>--Rick</p></div>
