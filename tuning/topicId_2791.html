As a matter of fact, I routinely use (in the key of C)<br/>&gt; the E, D, and A</p><p>About 15 years ago, when I had been trained as a classical<br/>composer and was trying to learn how to do blues properly,<br/>I found the following book to be a revelation:</p><p>Richard P. Daniels, 1979<br/>_The Heavy Guitar Bible: a Rock Guitar Manual_<br/>Cherry Lane Music, Port Chester.</p><p>In it, Daniels describes how guitarists think of the blues<br/>scale in terms of two different versions of what I&apos;ll call<br/>the &apos;minor&apos; pentatonic: a &apos;basic&apos; and a &apos;relative&apos;:</p><p>[Key of C]</p><p>Basic:         C   -  Eb  - F - G   -   Bb (- C)</p><p>Relative:  A - C - D   -  E   - G (- A)</p><p>He outlines how the basic scale is (obviously, by its name) used<br/>as the basis of improvising/riffing, and how the relative may<br/>be either used instead, or blended in.  Fascinating stuff.</p><p>According to my ears, this is a very accurate version of<br/>descriptive blues theory.  Great solos I&apos;ve known seem to<br/>use this technique, employing the &apos;relative&apos; as a way to<br/>bring in a &apos;major&apos; feel to the blues.  If you re-arrange<br/>the &apos;relative&apos; scale listed above so that it&apos;s &apos;root&apos;<br/>remains on &apos;C&apos;, you get the &apos;major&apos; pentatonic scale:</p><p>C - D - E - G - A</p><p>And the art of making great blues riffs is to some extent<br/>the performer&apos;s mastery at being able to introduce these<br/>&apos;foreign&apos; &apos;major&apos; elements into the overall &apos;minor&apos; sound<br/>of the blues.</p><p>Of course, another aspect of that mastery in the blues is the performer&apos;s<br/>ability with microtonal inflection.</p><p>Joseph L.

Possibly a terrible thing to do in real life, but instructive I<br/>think. Only one note changes pitch between succesive lattices.

Hardly seems worth the trouble. Even with the Bb-F as a free<br/>variable, it seems likely that 12-tET is still the optimum temperament,<br/>unless one also ignores one of the two possible Gb&apos;s.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/1999 1:17:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt;Joe Monzo wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Richard P.

In the blues, besides the so-called &quot;blues scale&quot;, one<br/>often uses the major pentatonic, but rarely for the whole song (outside of<br/>country music) -- more often one alternates passages of major pentatonic<br/>with ones in the minor pentatonic or blues scale.</p><p>&gt;It is interesting that Neil spells the note as F# despite also referring to<br/>&gt;it as the bV and despite Paul Erlich previously spelling it Gb. Gb makes<br/>&gt;more sense to me, because of the C-Eb-Gb diminished chord. What chords<br/>&gt;would spell it F#?</p><p>Chords are not constructed from the blues scale. It is a purely melodic<br/>scale. The chords used under the blues scale are usually major or dominant<br/>seventh chords. Gb might occur as the seventh of an Ab7 chord in a C minor<br/>blues, but much more commonly it is a non-harmonic tone.</p><p>A final note: Just because certain scales have been given the names &quot;blues<br/>scale&quot; and &quot;bebop scale&quot; doesn&apos;t mean those scales are necessary or<br/>sufficient conditions for the style after which they are named. I&apos;m pretty<br/>sure the same is true of Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, . . . scales, even if one<br/>reverts to the original Greek nomenclature. I was thinking the other day<br/>that I could rename some of my decatonic scales, such as &quot;Standard<br/>Pentachordal Minor,&quot; and call them Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,<br/>Maryland . . .</p></div>
