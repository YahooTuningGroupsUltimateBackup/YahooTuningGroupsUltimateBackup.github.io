Creating<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt;&gt;sound illustration for my book CD, I was moving the third of a C triad<br/>&gt;&gt;downward gradually from a &quot;locked&quot; major third position to a &quot;locked&quot; minor<br/>&gt;&gt;third position while holding the root and fifth constant. When I moved it<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;too far&quot; down to what was apparently a 6:7 ratio, I got a very audible low<br/>&gt;&gt;F in my recording. It took considerable time to find a &quot;compromise&quot;<br/>&gt; position<br/>&gt;&gt;that would both illustrate the point and avoid the low F.</p><p>Paul Erlich asked:</p><p>&gt; Why don&apos;t you think the tuning of the major triad with high third involves<br/>&gt; similar compromises? If you insist it doesn&apos;t, what did you think of my post<br/>&gt; where I suggested 1/24:1/19:1/16?<br/>&gt;<br/>At this point, I don&apos;t insist on anything except to report my observation<br/>that the &quot;high third&quot; appears to lock into an &quot;optimum consonance&quot; tuning<br/>when the root and fifth are sounding. Beyond that I&apos;m wide open to ideas,<br/>theories, and rationalizations. The only problem I have with viewing the<br/>&quot;high third&quot; as a compromise is that it locks (tunes) so vividly. It feels<br/>as &quot;right&quot; as a well-tuned perfect fifth, which makes me suspect that there<br/>is more to the matter than simply cultured preference.</p><p>Regarding the &quot;compromise&quot; in my minor triad illustration, I felt the<br/>frustration was a result of the inability of my M-1 to produce a &quot;locked&quot;<br/>minor triad as one would experience it in a vocal ensemble. While it clearly<br/>locked in the 14:18:21 triad (since it produced the audible combination<br/>tone), it seemed unable to lock in the more basic(?) 5:6, 4:5, 2:3<br/>components of the minor triad as I had hoped.</p><p>In order to offer a response to your 1/24:1/19:1/16 suggestion, I will need<br/>a clarification of this expression in what appears to be fractions. I&apos;m<br/>rather a novice at mathematical acoustics and this form is new to me. If<br/>it&apos;s not too much trouble, I&apos;d appreciate it.</p><p>Also, what did you think of my suggestion that perhaps the consonance of the<br/>high third is a result of the combined partial structures of both the root<br/>and the dominant pitches? I haven&apos;t done any numbers on this, but you can<br/>clearly do so much faster and intuitively than I. The reason it occurred to<br/>me (as you may remember) is that the high third only seems to be preferred<br/>when both root and fifth are sounding. It simply seems logical to look here<br/>for a clue.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
