Johnson<br/>Mykhaylo Khramov<br/>Carl Lumma<br/>Joel Mandelbaum<br/>Gene Ward Smith (please confirm, Gene)<br/>Jon Lyle Smith<br/>Daniel Stearns<br/>Hans Straub<br/>Daniel Thompson<br/>Jon Wild? (please contact me and confirm, Jon....)</p><p>I&apos;m excited to have spoken with Easley Blackwood, who is kindly sending me his 19-equal study to arrange for the concert. It will actually require 3 pianists at 2 pianos, b/c/ of the distribution of notes....</p><p>Thanks, everyone, looking forward to seeing the scores I have not yet seen on August 15th....if anyone is having issues with the deadline, please contact me, there may be some slight flexibility, as rehearsals are likely to start in mid-September. However, the pianists need as much time as possible to star learning the scores, hence the August deadline.</p><p>Again, the concert date is October 20th, here in Chicago. Any of you in the area or elsewhere, it would be great to see you there.</p><p>It hasn&apos;t been finalized, but I contacted my local NPR station (WBEZ)--the host and producer of the local arts/culture/politics show &apos;848&apos; was interested in the project, and said I will be interviewed about microtonality and the birth of this festival in early October on the radio---it will be a nice moment of exposure for microtonality, and the goal of fostering it here, I hope.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div>
