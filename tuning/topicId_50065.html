More notes and more harmonic relationships are in<br/>&gt; some sense harder, even if there were a cultural construct to support<br/>&gt; them.  But there isn&apos;t, and we are completely in the dark.  If it is<br/>&gt; so easy, please share with us your 31-tone music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for playing standard repertoire on a generalized keyboard, I do<br/>&gt; not doubt it is easier.  But for me it is still harder, at least at<br/>&gt; first, since I have already gotten over so much of the halberstadt<br/>&gt; learning curve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2003 10:54:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Mark,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I would say that (despite never having come within<br/>&gt; quite a few miles of a generalised keyboard) any keyboard<br/>&gt; instrument using a generalised layout (even those which<br/>&gt; have only 1 tuning scheme) must be a different instrument.<br/>&gt; If the Wilson style keyboard with its hexagonal layout had<br/>&gt; a more &apos;lever key&apos; type feel, then pianists of the halberstadt<br/>&gt; variety may take a look.

They<br/>were given a lot of consideration in designing the GK Scalatron<br/>keyboard.  See my message:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39407">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39407</a><br/>in which I point out that there is both touch coding and slightly<br/>convex key surfaces.  The latter feature also helps one to feel which<br/>portion of a key surface a finger is resting on, whereas a perfectly<br/>flat key surface would give no indication of whether the finger is<br/>centered on the key or nearer one edge.  I also mentioned this in<br/>another message:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46244">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46244</a></p><p>And I found that these tactile aids were effective even with a<br/>bedsheet covering the keys.</p><p>--George</p></div>
