I<br/>listed those. I also attempted to point out that it fails, SO FAR, to<br/>deal with those tunings outside these cultures. Now the purpose<br/>of theory it seems would be to notice generalities within the specifics<br/>we have. From here with the utmost care we can then<br/>speculate as to the next step. Now this is one direction theory might be<br/>applied and i am sad that few treat it that way or shy away<br/>from the vast unknown we haven&apos;t found a way to get to. I would like to<br/>point out that Yasser attempted to explain how scales<br/>evolve and built a system upon that. regardless of how it failed to pan<br/>out, he did give us some good insights into pentatonic<br/>harmony and in hindsight one can see how 17 and 22 was just a zag in a<br/>slightly different direction than his 19. The principle is<br/>still there. What this tells me is that as we evolve we want to do more<br/>than just an elaboration of what we did before, but also<br/>aspects that are not so easily exploited, on this ground both myself and<br/>Paul ended up with a version of 22, which i think is more<br/>than coincidence, it is a post-Yassarian move.  I sense as we break<br/>through the tuning ice of other cultures speculation along<br/>these lines might prove useful. On the other hand as more than one<br/>person has pointed out that pelog forms a good cycle at 9 places,<br/>the Indonesians seem to find it musically not of interest. It is<br/>important we learn to understand such things also. Myself i have<br/>been working with a Meta Slendro tuning of 12 pitches and have listened<br/>to versions of the 17, 22,27,32,37 tones Constant<br/>structures next in line. I have found at this time, it fails to provide<br/>me with anything more that isn&apos;t already there and actually<br/>Make some obvious perks obscured.<br/>    More than one composer has shown how music can be written in any ET<br/>for instance, but that is not the end of the question.<br/>When a musician walks up to an instrument they want it to omit sounds<br/>and combinations of sounds that inspire them to play<br/>more. Partch also by his instrument designs showed also how arrangements<br/>also play a part in this. Put the diamond in a room and<br/>people will play it, because it nourishes the player. Yes one can write<br/>in 15 ET but if we grew up in a culture that used such a<br/>thing this list would be the majority in no time. I think this scenario<br/>is a good speculative test for a tuning. If we were brought up<br/>in a culture using this tuning would we seek change or not or would we<br/>be satisfied and why.<br/>    Let&apos;s take one observation. In examining the tunings of various<br/>cultures one will notice that despite what might be translated in<br/>a few cases, people tend to like tunings where the sizes are not equal<br/>and vary in size from pitch to pitch. This is not to say that the<br/>basic gestalts (i would use archetype)  these scales does not lie with<br/>Moments of Symmetry or ET both which satisfy our desire<br/>for interval integrity (an interval having the same number of<br/>tonesin-between when played on different parts of the scale) but it<br/>appears human beings find the variation of intervals musically<br/>meaningful. One finds such things in even 12 ET with modal<br/>transpositions.<br/>    Its time to raise the stakes and aim higher than. We need to exploit<br/>the magic that inspires players and composers and listeners.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
