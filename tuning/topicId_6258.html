There are many differences between Barlow&apos;s idea and<br/> harmonic entropy. Harmonic entropy makes no reference to a scale, referring<br/> instead to a simultaneous dyad presented with no musical context.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I understand that.  But unless considered in a particular context, I can&apos;t<br/>ascribe much importance to a single interval, and Barlough seems to be the<br/>first to propose some criteria for evaluating such a context.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Your argument makes a strange circle here. Any given limit is an assumption<br/>of greater importance for simpler ratios in that the limit is (a) a limit and<br/>(b) the distribution of prime factors in any given octave will be biased<br/>towards the lower factors. (Two stupid observations on my part).  While the<br/>entropy idea may have no such assumption in itself,  by using the Farey<br/>series for your calculations you are are stuck with this bias. I don&apos;t happen<br/>to disagree with the results, but you won&apos;t get a significantly different<br/>answer by taking a set similar to that chosen by Barlow.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; So even if _a priori_ we can recognize<br/> ratios of arbitrary complexity (which is what the harmonic entropy model<br/> assumes), the imprecision of our hearing mechanism will spread any stimulus<br/> over a finite range in interval space. If the true interval is near a simple<br/> ratio, there won&apos;t be much confusion as to which ratio is heard; otherwise,<br/> many ratios will be included within the &quot;smear&quot; and the listener is<br/> confused.<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>This &quot;confusion&quot; doesn&apos;t conform to any real listening experience I&apos;ve ever<br/>had.  In experimental settings -- my work with all those minor thirds last<br/>year, for example -- the length of the listening period was everything in<br/>sorting out a series of intervals.  My sensation in analysing an interval<br/>over time is not that I am sorting through a smear of possible identities but<br/>rather that a single identity is gradually speaking, and that identity is not<br/>isolated from beating or difference tones. In real musical performances,<br/>where the smear is often really there (portamenti, vibrato) such rarified<br/>listening cannot take place, context is everything, and I find myself in need<br/>of something like Barlow&apos;s second condition</p><p>&lt;&lt; Harmonic entropy models dissonance with a mathematical measure of<br/> this confusion, namely the entropy of the set of probabilities associated<br/> with the proportion of the &quot;smear&quot; that is assigned to the various ratios.<br/> Entropy is the natural measure for disorder and also for informational<br/> complexity. &gt;&gt;</p><p>But similar to Tenney&apos;s use of entropy as a measure of variation in musical<br/>form, or the various applications of cybernetic theory in analysis used by<br/>Franz-Jochen Herfert,  I am still left with the feeling that a power tool is<br/>being used to tackle a task that can best be done manually</p><p>&lt;&lt; Now it may be that simple ratios _are_ more important even apart from the<br/> &quot;smearing&quot;, in which case harmonic entropy gives too much importance to<br/> complex ratios. Using a standard deviation of 0.6% is also quite ideal; even<br/> the best listener in Goldstein&apos;s experiment only acheived this accuracy in<br/> at some optimal frequency (was it 2000Hz) and did worse than 2% in other<br/> musically relevant areas. So the results I presented were absolutely the<br/> best-case scenario for perceiving complex ratios, aside from<br/> combination-tone effects. I think this is an important exercise before<br/> plunging into the endless array of ratios that are our disposal for<br/> constructing JI systems or evaluating tempered systems.<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>I am certain that Goldstein was working with very limited sample periods and<br/>a realistic evaluation of musical listening is going to have to take this<br/>into account, as well as work with timbres where beating becomes unavoidable.</p></div>
