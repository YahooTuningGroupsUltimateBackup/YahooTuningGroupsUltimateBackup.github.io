I wounder....</p><p>I have experimented with tryadic formula on waveforms in my diary, bur the numbers generated by these are HUGE, and to impractical to be used.</p><p>Still, cyborgs perception of music may be much deeper, richer, and mabey cyborgs could distuniguish between the trillionth prime and the trillion-and-oneth prime in Just Intonation with primes this big, -my point being that THE NUMBERS IN &quot;THEIR&quot; MUSIC WILL BE MUCH, MUCH BIGGER.....</p><p>Do any of you chess variant-playing-microtonalits have any comments about the websites which I have given you, and how big the numbers will become in the future of music, cyborgs, neural structure of absolute pitch possesors, and if technology will ever give non-bsolute pitch possesors, well, er....absolute pitch, and artificial intelligence produceing human sounding microtonal music.</p><p>What I do know is that absolute pitch does have a genetic components to it.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>----Sarn.</p><p>      __________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Yahoo!7: Catch-up on your favourite Channel 7 TV shows easily, legally, and for free at PLUS7. <a href="http://www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7">www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7</a></p></div><h3><a id=86162 href="#86162">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 5:23:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>yes</p><p>is it still art if music is produced and consumed by artificial beings who<br/>do not have emotion?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any comments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----Sarn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86163 href="#86163">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 5:50:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; is it still art if music is produced and consumed by artificial<br/>&gt; beings who do not have emotion?</p><p>Chris,</p><p>why couldn&apos;t artificial beings have emotions?</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=86164 href="#86164">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 5:53:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If you mean microtonal composers (or some authors of contemporary pop styles) and their consumers, then yes :-)</p><p>If you mean robots, then no.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 9 Feb 2010, at 10:23 PM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is it still art if music is produced and consumed by artificial &gt; beings who do not have emotion?<br/>&gt;</p></div>
