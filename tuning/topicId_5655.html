There are only 2 tunings (or pure tuning models) in Western art music:<br/>&gt; just intonation and the spiral of fiths.  These provide the conceptual models<br/>&gt; of intonation necessary to composing.  Temperaments are designed to get a<br/>&gt; combination effect, and to achieve modulation.  Temperaments tend to favor<br/>&gt; one tuning or another.</p><p>Johnny, does that mean that quartertone music doesn&apos;t exist? It&apos;s definitely<br/>not derived from a spiral of fifths. Should it then be considered as just<br/>intonation? True, the 11/8 interval is almost perfect, but all the other<br/>intervals, even if some tend to the 11-limit are really too far *out of<br/>tune* to pretend for some just intonation.</p><p>&gt; 4.  Both AFMM performances of the &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; and the &quot;Unanswered<br/>&gt; Question&quot; demonstrated the value of this tuning orientation in the<br/>&gt; performance.  The recent &quot;Unanswered Question&quot; had more universal approval<br/>&gt; than any other performance of any single piece of any single composer since<br/>&gt; the AFMM began in 1981.</p><p>Congratulations.

I said there are 2 tunings and that<br/>each temperament favors either the spiral of fifths or the overtone-derived<br/>just intonation.</p><p>Quartertones are, like 12-tone equal temperament, more pythagorean leaning.<br/>It is really just a second circle of tempered fifths, similar to having 2<br/>whole-tone scales.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
