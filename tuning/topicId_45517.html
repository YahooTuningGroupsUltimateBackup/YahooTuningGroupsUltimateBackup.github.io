I am following the OS X<br/>CoreAudio stuff somewhat, and understand that logic audio is being<br/>integrated with OS X and as such will use OS X Audio Units.</p><p>Right now there is a discussion in the apple CoreAudio mailing list<br/>regarding what should be &quot;minimal requirements&quot; for Music Device audio<br/>units, which are basically plug-in midi synths.  I have wanted to say<br/>something about tunings, but have not yet composed my thoughts about what<br/>should be said.</p><p>In any case this is perhaps a good opportunity for us to give input into the<br/>process to helpe make sure that OS X supports alternate tunings in a more<br/>universal as opposed to a piecemeal way.</p><p>I am going to try to clarify this and present it to the list.  Others who<br/>have things to say might want to join the CoreAudio list and give inputs.<br/>It is primary a list to support developers, but it is an open forum, and<br/>anyone who wants to join can do so I belive by going to <a href="http://lists.apple.com">lists.apple.com</a> and<br/>selecting CoreAudio and going through the steps.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p></div>
