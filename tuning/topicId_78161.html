I do remember neutral-sounding thirds and sevenths, like you would in the Rast maqam. The Wikipedia article you mention:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Georgia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Georgia</a></p><p>says:</p><p>&quot;Between the unison and the fifth, however, come three evenly-spaced notes, producing a compressed (compared to most European music) major second, a neutral third, and a stretched perfect fourth. Likewise, between the fifth and the octave come two evenly-spaced notes, producing a compressed major sixth and a stretched minor seventh. This system of tuning renders thirds as the most consonant interval after fifths, which resulted in the third being treated as a stable interval in Georgia long before it acquired that status in Western music.&quot;</p><p>Four equal divisions of a fifth produces, in cents: 175.5 351 525.5 702. Three equal divisions of a fourth on top of that would be 702 868 1034 1200. A JI approximation could be: 1/1 21/19 11/9 19/14 3/2 33/20 20/11 2/1 (or in way-too-simple ratios: 1/1 10/9 11/9 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1).</p><p>But this is speculation on my part too, and possibly the author(s) of the Wikipedia article as well. There has to be pretty wide variation of tuning; the Muslim minority of the country likely has some historical Ottoman Turkish influence.</p><p>So we&apos;ll have a &quot;Georgian&quot; (or &quot;Kartveli&quot;) temperament coming soon? ~D.</p></div>
