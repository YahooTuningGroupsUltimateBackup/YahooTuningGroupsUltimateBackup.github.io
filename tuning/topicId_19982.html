It appears that they avoid certain just intervals in places in order to prevent the music from reaching a cadence too soon. this way they can play the same melody for extended periods without hitting a dead stop. but more after it is up! I remember playing Bartok&apos;s bagpipe melody from Microkosmos is the tuning you have below :) more to come.</p><p>David C Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s my proposal for comment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is the Scottish bagpipes scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Answer:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Great Highland Bagpipes have a bass drone, two tenor drones and a chanter, all using double reeds.
