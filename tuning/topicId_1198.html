Well, my<br/>   piece consists of an arpeggiation of that chord, starting<br/>   first in 12-Eq, then cycling thru four JI versions, with<br/>   only the &quot;4th&quot; of the chord changing in pitch:<br/>   [2^(5/12)] - 21/16 - 4/3 - 43/32 - 11/8 -<br/>   and back down: [11/8] - 43/32 - 4/3 - 21/16 - 2^(5/12).<br/>.  Oddly enough, all those beautiful JI chords sounded<br/>   like they were &quot;going somewhere&quot;, then a<br/>   *strong sense of resolution was felt when the<br/>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>   chord landed back in 12-Eq*.  I have no way to explain this.<br/>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>- Monzo<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
