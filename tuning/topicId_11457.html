I&apos;ve always thought<br/>that consonance and dissonance were opposites, but dissonance implies<br/>actual beating intervals, does it not?</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Since you seem to agree with Blackwood in principle, it might be<br/>&gt;clearer, especially when conversing with those trained in the Western<br/>&gt;tradition, to use this terminological distinction.</p><p>Well, I have no problem adjusting my use of words for the purpose of<br/>clear communication.  But, the more I read of your post, the more<br/>confused things seem to get:</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;_However_, I part with both you an Blackwood in that I see some<br/>&gt;fluidity in what constitutes consonance, depending on musical style. In<br/>&gt;Gothic music, for example, a triad was felt to be dissonant, and had to<br/>&gt;resolve to a 3-limit dyad. In blues and rock the dominant seventh can<br/>&gt;be used for all the chords in the I-IV-I-V-IV-I progression, and it has<br/>&gt;no need to resolve to a triad. Similarly, much latin jazz in a<br/>&gt;mixed-minor mode ends on a minor chord with added major sixth. In this<br/>&gt;spirit, my paper (<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>)<br/>&gt;proposes a new type of &quot;tonal&quot; music where approximations to 4:5:6:7<br/>&gt;and 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 tetrads can, with enough exposure, become<br/>&gt;recognized as the canonical &quot;consonances&quot;, to which other chords would<br/>&gt;resolve, and compared to which, triads would sound incomplete.</p><p>I fact I agree at both ends; I like sparse music that resolves to open<br/>fifths (&quot;a 3-limit dyads&quot;), and can get my ear around music heavily<br/>laden with tetrads, even on the final tonic.  For the music I listen to<br/>most, my original statement holds, as the 4:5:6:7 chord, while<br/>wonderfully, uhhh, non-beating, contains a longing quality that begs for<br/>resolution.</p><p>Your proposed definition for the word &quot;consonant&quot;, Blackwood<br/>notwithstanding, seems to rob it of almost all substance; it is reduced<br/>to a subjective feeling fluid with context and the listener&apos;s ear.  This<br/>is inconsistent with my past exposure to the word.  I&apos;d be curious to<br/>know how other list members feel.  Again, it is not my purpose to argue<br/>over words; we are allies in wanting to communicate clearly.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=11516 href="#11516">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2000 8:33:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Regarding the words &quot;consonant&quot; and &quot;concordant&quot;, and which word better<br/>describes a 7-limit dom 7th (pure tones, but longing for resolution),<br/>I just consulted Monzo&apos;s tuning dictionary at</p><p>   <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm</a></p><p>His definition largely agrees with Paul&apos;s, equating consonance with a<br/>feeling of being &apos;at rest&apos;.</p><p>Monz doesn&apos;t have entries for concordance or discordance.

When width is<br/>centered on the &quot;cuvette&quot;, roughness disapears. There is no beat between<br/>harmonics of the two notes or there is no overlap of &quot;bandes critiques&quot; in<br/>&quot;cili&eacute;es&quot; cells. At small distance of the center begin roughness which then<br/>go up rapidly. As acoustical phenomenon, it depends of (&quot;timbre&quot; or<br/>&quot;spectre&quot;) i.e. presence or absence of harmonics (for possible interaction).</p><p>[2] CONSONANCE/DISSONANCE as microtonal perception don&apos;t depend of timbre.<br/>It&apos;s not a local information like roughness but a global infornation on<br/>&quot;cuvette&quot; position as whole. This information gives not the possibility to<br/>appreciate degree of fusion but to determine, when there are several notes,<br/>which chord is formed, what is the approximative global structure.</p><p>[3] CONCORDANCE/DISCORDANCE dichotomy (partially described on my web pages)<br/>is  a macrotonal concept. On a very coherent set of tones with a<br/>constitutive well-defined set of chords, introduction of extension tones in<br/>chords for harmonic vertical completion, introduces discordance. It&apos;s not<br/>forcely dissonant. But it&apos;s like a tourist visitor : he has to return for<br/>he&apos;s not citizen of coherent set. This process is not incompatible with<br/>parallele process of dissonance reduction. In Zarlino context F of G B D F<br/>is discordant. With triton BF  resolution process : B toward C is only<br/>reduction of dissonance (15 - 1), but F toward E is not only reduction of<br/>dissonance (21 - 5), it&apos;s also a formal return of the discordant 21/16.<br/>What is the part of a such macrotonal factor in need for resolution ?</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=11527 href="#11527">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2000 12:41:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard wrote:]<br/>&gt;I am having difficulty with the notion that the 4567 needs to resolve.</p><p>When you hear a 4:5:6:7 chord, with approximately equal volumes in all<br/>notes and some voice with harmonic overtones (a piano, say), do you<br/>experience a sense of &quot;rest&quot;, or the need to resolve?

There is a hunger in the sound, to my ear.</p><p>I&apos;ve read with fascination this exchange about the musical and emotional effects of the 4:5:6:7 chord.  I listen to a lot of what they call &quot;early&quot; music; that is, Western art (and  sometimes folk) music<br/>written during the medieval and Renaissance periods.  (Yes, I know &quot;they&quot; include Baroque, too, but I don&apos;t.  Baroque sounds modern to me.)  Much of this music is customarily performed in purer tunings than<br/>later Western art music usually is, especially if played on period instruments.  That leaves lots of opportunities for the listener to fill in the harmonies with &quot;missing&quot; 3rds and 7ths.  I&apos;ve become quite<br/>used to the increased satisfaction of ending a phrase, and especially the last phrase of a piece, as 4:5:6:7.  It has come to feel more resolved to me than the technically more consonant 4:5:6, just as an<br/>ending of  4:5:6 feels more resolved than an open 5th does to almost any modern Westerner.</p><p>Even so, I think I know exactly what John means by the terms &quot;hunger&quot; and &quot;longing.&quot;  The added 7th gives me the same sort of feeling, but I&apos;ve come to know that feeling well enough to be comfortable with<br/>it, to feel at home with it, even to not want to go home (so to speak) without it.  It&apos;s a closely related feeling to the basis of the blues, IMO.  It&apos;s bittersweet, and it&apos;s a taste that can grow on you<br/>until _you_ begin to long for _it_.  Try it with Concerto Italaliano&apos;s Monteverdi recordings, especially the Musica Sacra CD.  Try whistling a 7th over a major tonic chord played by a good natural brass<br/>ensemble - it&apos;ll blow your mind when it locks in tune.  It shakes your being at a level that 5-limit music can&apos;t touch.</p><p>Another fun exercise, though not involving a final cadential chord, uses a recent hit song in the US: &quot;Fly Away&quot; by Lenny Kravitz.  His triadic vocal harmonies on the words &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; in the chorus<br/>are quite nicely tuned, close enough to get a good, buzzy 7th with many of them.  The progression there is IIIb-VIIb-IV-(I), or C-G-D in the key of A.  Try singing the 7th over all three chords, making each<br/>as nearly pure 7:4 (octave invariance taken for granted) to the chord root as possible.  Delicious!</p><p>--<br/>David J.

But perhaps not .<br/>.<br/>.</p></div>
