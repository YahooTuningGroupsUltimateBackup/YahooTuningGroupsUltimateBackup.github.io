It&apos;s easy to understand the appeal. Reduced mental<br/>clutter. Order through the chaos. Or, a quick answer to avoid the<br/>unpredictability of changing one&apos;s mind.</p><p>I bring this up because I think that really expressive great stuff can be done<br/>in tunings that pay no heed to the golden calf, or holy grail of &apos;how close<br/>is this sound to JI&apos;. Of course, JI is beautiful and serves a purpose. But I<br/>also think 12-tet does. I just got through giving a 1hr 45 min recital in<br/>12-tet, and didn&apos;t feel at all lacking for it. (is this a coming out of the<br/>closet as a pan-acceptance of all tunings kind-of-guy?)There is plenty of<br/>room for everyone in the world!</p><p>Of course, I&apos;ve had moments of purely being inspired by the otherness that is<br/>possible in the &apos;terra nova&apos; of possibilities for a 21st century of tonality<br/>ushered in by new tunings and tuning systems.</p><p>I think there is an almost overwhelming richness, enough for 40 lifetimes, and<br/>it is kind of scary--fully exploring one makes one feel that one has to<br/>forsake all the others to really accomplish something in a given tuning, like<br/>ho a great composer like Bach accomplished something (leaving alone the<br/>possibility that the Bach phenom is a repeatable, or quasi-repeatable thing).<br/>So, the systematic mind needs to feel that they are making a wise<br/>choice--hence the &quot;this is close to this kind of JI interval &quot; analysis....</p><p>Then, maybe monz is just doing all these different things just for the pure<br/>fun of it. I understand that. This topic is for most of us, an obsession. And<br/>the odd thing about obsession is how IRRATIONAL it is!!!! in a really really<br/>frightening and fascinating way...for instance, there is not a day that goes<br/>by where I don&apos;t repeat some of the same thoughts I&apos;ve always had about<br/>tuning in my head, over and over and over again. It almost always remains<br/>static like that, but occassionally, there will be an epiphany. Does anyone<br/>else know what I&apos;m talking about? This obssession? Or does what I&apos;m saying<br/>remain opaque?</p><p>What are all of your thoughts on this topic?</p><p>Best,<br/>AKJ</p><p>P.S. Every once in a while, I love doing aesthetic conversations. Don&apos;t get me<br/>wrong, I love the technical math stuff, but I feel it has to turn into music<br/>somewhere, and that the math is just a tool.</p><p>But I have to say, I&apos;m so thankful to you all that you exist! I feel like this<br/>strange need I have to think about this (not strange to me, but axiomatic) is<br/>really quite satisfied and compelled having others who share this need.<br/>And it&apos;s a rare need, no?</p><p>On Monday 20 October 2003 12:11 am, monz wrote:<br/>&gt; hi paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; re:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/edo-prime-error.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/edo-prime-error.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; as you know, monz, i think this is not a good way to evaluate<br/>&gt; &gt; how well an ET represents JI sonorities, or even how the<br/>&gt; &gt; primes are best represented in a particular ET. for instance,<br/>&gt; &gt; i find that in a major triad, getting a good approximation of<br/>&gt; &gt; the 6:5 just minor third is nearly, if not equally, important<br/>&gt; &gt; as getting a good approximation of the 5:4 just major third,<br/>&gt; &gt; and when one considers the fifth too the second-closest<br/>&gt; &gt; approximation of prime 5 is often a better choice than<br/>&gt; &gt; the closest one.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and of course that&apos;s only considering a single chord -- many<br/>&gt; &gt; other issues come into play when considering progressions, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; if there&apos;s one thing i hope to have communicated in 7 years on<br/>&gt; &gt; this list, it&apos;s the above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, i did already know that you felt this way, and i also<br/>&gt; knew that you were going to mention it after i announced<br/>&gt; the new webpage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; however, i still feel that these lists and graphs give data<br/>&gt; that is worth considering when evaluating and/or comparing<br/>&gt; EDOs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if it&apos;s important to consider how well an EDO represents<br/>&gt; the 6/5 ratio, can&apos;t one see that already by looking at<br/>&gt; how well it represents both 3 and 5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; anyway, i&apos;ll probably just add your comment to the page as<br/>&gt; a sort of &quot;disclaimer&quot; ... hopefully that will make it<br/>&gt; more acceptable to you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

It&apos;s easy to understand the appeal. Reduced mental &gt;clutter. Order through the chaos. Or, a quick answer to avoid the &gt;unpredictability of changing one&apos;s mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I bring this up because I think that really expressive great stuff can be done &gt;in tunings that pay no heed to the golden calf, or holy grail of &apos;how close &gt;is this sound to JI&apos;. Of course, JI is beautiful and serves a purpose. But I &gt;also think 12-tet does. I just got through giving a 1hr 45 min recital in &gt;12-tet, and didn&apos;t feel at all lacking for it. (is this a coming out of the &gt;closet as a pan-acceptance of all tunings kind-of-guy?)There is plenty of &gt;room for everyone in the world!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Of course, I&apos;ve had moments of purely being inspired by the otherness that is &gt;possible in the &apos;terra nova&apos; of possibilities for a 21st century of tonality &gt;ushered in by new tunings and tuning systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think there is an almost overwhelming richness, enough for 40 lifetimes, and &gt;it is kind of scary--fully exploring one makes one feel that one has to &gt;forsake all the others to really accomplish something in a given tuning, like &gt;ho a great composer like Bach accomplished something (leaving alone the &gt;possibility that the Bach phenom is a repeatable, or quasi-repeatable thing). &gt;So, the systematic mind needs to feel that they are making a wise &gt;choice--hence the &quot;this is close to this kind of JI interval &quot; analysis....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then, maybe monz is just doing all these different things just for the pure &gt;fun of it. I understand that. This topic is for most of us, an obsession. And &gt;the odd thing about obsession is how IRRATIONAL it is!!!! in a really really &gt;frightening and fascinating way...for instance, there is not a day that goes &gt;by where I don&apos;t repeat some of the same thoughts I&apos;ve always had about &gt;tuning in my head, over and over and over again. It almost always remains &gt;static like that, but occassionally, there will be an epiphany. Does anyone &gt;else know what I&apos;m talking about? This obssession?
