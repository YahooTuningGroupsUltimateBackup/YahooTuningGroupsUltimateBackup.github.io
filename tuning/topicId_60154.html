Probably just as well, or I would spend<br/>too much time making it even more argumentative.</p><p>Some more points. As has been pointed out, many Bach pieces use lots<br/>of enharmonic alternatives. The musical reason for this is that they<br/>use constant thematic material to modulate through a wide range of<br/>keys. For example, the Art of Fugue uses A# in a dominant chord in the<br/>key of B, even though the piece begins and ends in one flat.</p><p>Although &apos;wrong&apos; meantone alternatives can be used as local colour if<br/>they occur only for an instant, they won&apos;t be acceptable as major<br/>components of the structure of a tonality - particularly when most of<br/>the other tonalities in the piece sound quite normal. Consider that<br/>Bach often transposes a passage into B minor which was in A minor<br/>before. I don&apos;t think it would be acceptable for most of the parallel<br/>passages to sound normal - *until* we get to the one which has a<br/>&apos;wrong&apos; enharmonic note - which will stick out like the proverbial<br/>sore thumb. The F# minor Toccata is another good example of this<br/>&apos;durchfuehrung&apos; - taking the same musical idea through many keys -<br/>which looms large in the WTC too.</p><p>There is even an early work which ends with a complete trip round the<br/>cycle of fifths - a Fugue in D minor I think.</p><p>Next, consider that Bach ordered the pieces in the WTC in this way: C<br/>c C# c# D d ... What sort of retuning would you have to do to go from<br/>C to C minor? Then C minor to C sharp major (alias D flat major)? Then<br/>to C sharp minor? Then to D major? If you were determined to use some<br/>sort of meantone and wanted to play the book through in sequence,<br/>you&apos;d spend more time retuning than playing (at least 2 or 3 notes<br/>have to be retuned each time!), and probably break most of the strings<br/>in the process. Every step in retuning goes to the flatward side,<br/>which means raising the notes by a comma or two.</p><p>Next, it was told of Bach that he could make distant modulations sound<br/>as smooth as near modulations. How could this be the case, unless his<br/>tuning (whatever it was on the day!) allowed distant modulations<br/>without glaring differences in intonation?</p><p>Also, how can we make sense of the witness statement that Bach<br/>introduced unique subtleties into his tuning, unless it was something<br/>different from the well-known meantone or slightly modified meantone?</p><p>Without wishing to go too far into Bach&apos;s psychology, why would he<br/>write a book called &apos;The Well-Tempered Keyboard&apos; if he didn&apos;t have<br/>some definite aim in mind and this aim differed from the usual<br/>practice of the time? I think it&apos;s fairly clear that the usual<br/>practice did *not* allow you to play in all 24 keys successfully.</p><p>For the Werckmeister advocates: what about Werckmeister V, a tuning<br/>which he introduces later than III and specifically says is good for<br/>music with a lot of accidentals? What about the instructions in a<br/>chapter of Musikalische Temperatur (Von der Temperatur Insgemein) when<br/>he says tune all the thirds as sharp as you can stand among the<br/>naturals, with all the fifths &apos;a little bit flat&apos;, and proceed the<br/>same way through the whole keyboard? What about when he calls the<br/>Pythagorean major thirds &apos;very hard&apos; - can we believe that three long<br/>preludes and fugues were written by Bach to exploit the incessant<br/>jangling of these big major thirds? Can you be satisfied with the<br/>A-flat major Prelude and Fugue in Werckmeister III?</p><p>All these considerations leave *some* Werckmeister (maybe not III!),<br/>equal, or some other circulating temp. standing. But equal can be<br/>eliminated, firstly through Barnes&apos; old article in Early Music showing<br/>that Bach composed quite differently in different keys - secondly,<br/>since would be the musical point of deploying exactly the same musical<br/>material in different keys if there were no contrast in intonation<br/>between the keys?</p><p>As to Neidhardt, we have to remember that he was a raw novice and<br/>enthusiast of 12-ET in 1706 or whenever this tuning contest took<br/>place. Don&apos;t judge his life&apos;s work by this youthful mishap.</p><p>Now... does this mean we know what Bach&apos;s tuning intention was in the<br/>WTC? No, but it exposes some candidates as much less likely than others.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=60155 href="#60155">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/2/2005 3:35:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Tom,</p><p>&gt; But equal can be<br/>&gt; eliminated, firstly through Barnes&apos; old article in Early Music<br/>&gt; showing that Bach composed quite differently in different keys -<br/>&gt; secondly, since would be the musical point of deploying exactly<br/>&gt; the same musical material in different keys if there were no<br/>&gt; contrast in intonation between the keys?</p><p>Hiya Tom,</p><p>I haven&apos;t read the Barnes article but I have read that absolute<br/>pitch was considered to convey colors and emotions through the<br/>time of Mozart, at least.
