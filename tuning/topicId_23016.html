If I<br/>understand you correctly, this is why the mathematical notation was not<br/>preferred.  My argument against EDO and relatives is just the O part.</p><p>&lt;&lt;I thought i was<br/>integer, &gt;&gt;</p><p>&quot;i&quot; means &quot;imaginary number&quot;, or the square root of -1.  The set of integers<br/>contains the set of natural numbers, zero, and the negative numbers.  Since<br/>we don&apos;t want negatuves or zero; we want only the positive integers.  These<br/>are the natural numbers, which can use a variety of letters, avoiding letters<br/>like e and i.</p><p>Reading through your response, it seemed more clear that 144-ED2 would be a<br/>good compromise between math and words since it&apos;s an acronym that doesn&apos;t<br/>contain the term &quot;octave&quot; (which we have to apologise for) and it&apos;s not a<br/>_completely abstract generalisation, which (though I prefer math myself) is<br/>more cryptic in a verbal context.  All the acronyms could be simplified:</p><p>ED2 = equally-divided &quot;octave&quot;         ex: equal temperaments<br/>UD2 = unequally-divided &quot;octave&quot;       ex: meantones<br/>EDk = equally-divided non-&quot;octave&quot;    ex: BP; 88-cet<br/>UDk = unequally-divided non-&quot;octave&quot;  ex: stretch tunings</p><p>k doesn&apos;t have to be a whole number, so it can be things like pi and phi, etc.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3>X.
