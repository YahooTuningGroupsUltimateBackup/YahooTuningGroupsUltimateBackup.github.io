Lots of you<br/>will probably remember the chapters in question, but some might never have<br/>come across these ideas so I&apos;ll give a quick overview (with the caveat<br/>that I don&apos;t &apos;buy&apos; the ideas, though I think they&apos;re extremely interesting<br/>and the products of a very fertile mind)  --I just reread Yasser a few<br/>weeks ago and he&apos;s great.</p><p>In Yasser&apos;s book *A Theory of Evolving Tonality*, (from the 30&apos;s I think)<br/>he suggests that musical systems tend towards the more complex over time,<br/>developing according to a Fibonacci-like sequence that has given rise to<br/>pentatonic, heptatonic and dodecaphonic systems in the West, and that the<br/>next logical step should be 19-tones per octave (arguments for this point<br/>of view take up most of the book; I haven&apos;t done the idea justice).</p><p>Towards the end of the book Yasser explains that certain composers are<br/>sensitive to this historical development and its implications; they<br/>recognise, dimly, the potential of Yasser&apos;s &quot;supra-diatonic,&quot; and their<br/>inner ear gropes towards the sonorities of the 19-tone system. When<br/>Schoenberg uses all twelve chromatic tones, says Yasser, it is because he<br/>*wants* (subconsciously) to hear the 12-out-of-19 collection (which would<br/>replace our 7-out-of-12 as &apos;basic&apos; subset) but the closest he can<br/>approximate it, in 12tet, is to use all 12 chromatic notes. Likewise when<br/>Debussy uses a wholetone scale, it is because he intuits the &apos;basic hexad&apos;<br/>of 19tet (I think it&apos;s built by taking every other note of the<br/>12-within-19 scale, analogous to diatonic 7th chords in 12tet) but the<br/>closest he can approximate it is by the wholetone scale.  Perhaps most<br/>interesting is that Yasser explains Scriabin&apos;s &apos;mystic chord&apos; (which can<br/>be seen as a wholetone collection with one note shifted by a semitone) as<br/>Scriabin&apos;s *own* approximation of the basic 19tet hexad, technically not<br/>as accurate as Debussy&apos;s but capturing the essential assymetry of the<br/>19-tone version.</p><p>So Yasser, then, believed that no one would use these symmetrical, sterile<br/>chords for their own sake. Rather *in spite* of their symmetry<br/>(&quot;sterility&quot;) they are chosen because they approximate particular<br/>*asymmetrical* chords from the next musical system, just around the corner<br/>(which alas we&apos;re still waiting for, as far as the mainstream is<br/>concerned).</p><p>best wishes --jon wild</p></div><h3><a id=7307 href="#7307">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

His book was a great inspiration<br/>for me, but unfortunately Yasser&apos;s logic rests essentially on numerology (in<br/>that he searches for number patters without any underlying reason as to<br/>_why_ they should occur), and a very _selective_ use of acoustical ratios<br/>(when they support his theory, not when they don&apos;t).</p><p>An appoach inspired by, and similar to, Yasser&apos;s was taken by David<br/>Kraehenbuehl and Christopher Schmidt in &quot;On the Development of Musical<br/>Systems&quot;, _Journal of Music Theory_ vol. 6 no. 1 (1962) pp. 32-65. Unlike<br/>Yasser they put everything in just intonation, but like Yasser they use<br/>arbitrary manipulations of numbers based on patterns without giving any<br/>reasons for them.</p><p>You may enjoy reading my paper _Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two-Tone<br/>Tempermant_ (Xenharmonikon 17 or<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>) which combines a<br/>Yasser-like proposal of a hierarchy of simple to complex tonal systems with<br/>a Partch/Vogel view of what the &quot;next level of complexity&quot; would be for the<br/>basic harmonic unit after the familiar 5-limit triad (namely, the 7-limit<br/>tetrad). Although I&apos;ve written it very concisely, I hope you&apos;ll agree it<br/>provides ample justification for all its assumptions, rather than simply<br/>following perceived number patters. (Please ignore page 20; it is in error).</p><p>Anyway, as far as chords like the augmented triad and diminished seventh, I<br/>think the relevant point is simply that, by any of the measures of<br/>dissonance in the psychoacoustic literature, a JI tuning would not minimize<br/>dissonance, even though it does so for most other chords.</p></div><h3><a id=7327 href="#7327">ðŸ”—</a>jon wild &#x3C;wild@xxx.xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/1999 1:25:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul E wrote:</p><p>&gt; thanks for bringing up Yasser.

I&apos;d say, though, that his patterns aren&apos;t as empty<br/>and numerological as you seem to say - for example the Fibonacci-like<br/>sequence 5-7-12-19-31 etc occurs because each stage conflates the two<br/>earlier stages: the chromatic came about by combining the diatonic with a<br/>configuration of the earlier pentatonic (the &quot;black keys&quot;, slotted in<br/>between the usual diatonic). (Just to be safe: while I think it&apos;s an<br/>appealing theory in some sense, it&apos;s definitely a pretty kooky one and not<br/>one I&apos;d defend as being true -- but Yasser *does* present a rationale for<br/>the patterns, one that is more than mere numerology.)</p><p>&gt; An appoach inspired by, and similar to, Yasser&apos;s was taken by David<br/>&gt; Kraehenbuehl and Christopher Schmidt in &quot;On the Development of Musical<br/>&gt; Systems&quot;, _Journal of Music Theory_ vol. 6 no. 1 (1962) pp. 32-65.<br/>&gt; Unlike Yasser they put everything in just intonation, but like Yasser<br/>&gt; they use arbitrary manipulations of numbers based on patterns without<br/>&gt; giving any reasons for them.</p><p>Yes, I came across this article once but was disappointed in it. My memory<br/>tends to associate it with a Carlton Gamer article of similar vintage, in<br/>the same journal, which I enjoyed much more. It looked at deep scales in<br/>different ETs, but I can&apos;t remember whether there were hierarchical ideas<br/>like Yasser&apos;s, and Kraehenbuehl/Schmidt&apos;s.</p><p>&gt; You may enjoy reading my paper _Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two-Tone<br/>&gt; Tempermant_ (Xenharmonikon 17 or<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>) which combines a<br/>&gt; Yasser-like proposal of a hierarchy of simple to complex tonal systems<br/>&gt; with a Partch/Vogel view of what the &quot;next level of complexity&quot; would<br/>&gt; be for the basic harmonic unit after the familiar 5-limit triad</p><p>Thanks - I read it a couple of years ago, and liked it - have there been<br/>any recent changes? The other proposal of a simple-to-complex hierarchy of<br/>systems that comes to mind is Carey and Clampitt&apos;s paper on Well-formed<br/>Scales, in Music Theory Spectrum, maybe &apos;89? or &apos;87?  Their sequence goes<br/>...7, 12, 17... and I can&apos;t remember what comes next, but that too<br/>reminded me of something Yasseresque. You know, even lots of John<br/>Clough-type scale theory, with the ideas of &quot;sub-diatonic&quot; and<br/>&quot;hyper-diatonic&quot;, seems to owe a greater debt to Yasser (&quot;infra-diatonic&quot;,<br/>&quot;ultra-diatonic&quot;) than anyone ever acknowledges. Or how about Clough&apos;s<br/>&quot;second-order maximally-even&quot; business - these principles are basically<br/>what Yasser follows in choosing his 6-within-12 hexad from the<br/>12-within-19 scale of 19tet.</p><p>One last thing tangentially about Yasser - someone asked me if I knew what<br/>was the earliest use of &apos;Locrian&apos; to name the last mode of the major<br/>scale. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s older, but the earliest I could find at the time was<br/>in Yasser!

Balzano really trained himself to hear</p><p>&gt;12tet and 20tet by systematically learning all of the simple divisions<br/>(i.e.<br/>&gt;12 by 2,3,4,6; 20 by 2,4,5,10) and then the cyclic patterns (i.e. by<br/>&gt;relatively prime divisions like 5 or 7 in 12).  This is basically the same<br/>&gt;mode of hearing as that demanded by Princeton-style 12-tone music,  so your</p><p>&gt;evaluation of whether it is &quot;musically relevant&quot; or not may be essentially<br/>an<br/>&gt;aesthetic one.  I find that with a small bit of practice, one can learn to<br/>&gt;recognize basic tri- and hexachords, as well as complete aggregates, _by<br/>ear_<br/>&gt;in 12tet pieces by Hauer, Webern, Schoenberg, Babbitt.  I can&apos;t imagine why</p><p>&gt;it would be otherwise in 20, which shares the same number of divisors as<br/>12.</p><p>That&apos;s all well and good, but doesn&apos;t address the point. This mode of<br/>hearing would work for any ET, but Balzano singles out 12, 20, 30, 42, . . .<br/>. Balzano claimed that _tonal_, _diatonic_, _triadic_ behavior was governed<br/>by the fact that the size of the major third (4) times the size of the minor<br/>third (3) is equal to the size of the whole set (12). His presentation of<br/>this case is extremely elegant but unfortunately abstract enough to conceal<br/>its true nature -- a sly fallacy. If Costeley or Vicentino had won out, our<br/>tonal, diatonic, triadic music would be in 19 or 31, not 12, and the Balzano<br/>theory falls flat on its face.</p></div>
