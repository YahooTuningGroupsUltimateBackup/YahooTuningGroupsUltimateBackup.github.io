You pick an interval, the &quot;generator&quot;, and make a<br/>chain out of it.</p><p>A D G C</p><p>is a chain of three generators of 500 cents.  The chain will<br/>form a MOS, or not, depending on its length.  It will never<br/>be a MOS if the interval shares a common factor with the<br/>octave.*  The octave is 12 steps, so the generator can&apos;t be<br/>2, 3, 4, or 6 steps.  In 19-ET, every generator works<br/>because 19 is prime.</p><p>In an ET, the chains you get with some generator are the same<br/>as those you get with its octave inversion.  So you don&apos;t need<br/>to consider generators bigger than half an octave.  That&apos;s why<br/>I didn&apos;t bother saying that 8, 9, and 10 steps were not going<br/>to give MOS in 12-ET -- because those chains are just<br/>inversions of the chains based on 2, 3, and 4 steps.</p><p>This won&apos;t be a complete answer, but it should get you going.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>* There&apos;s a subtlety here to do with terminology... which is<br/>safe for you to ignore.</p></div><h3><a id=104336 href="#104336">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2012 10:04:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, chrisvaisvil@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a feeling this question will show how little I know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it possible to construct a MOS scale in 12 equal?</p><p>I started this wiki page just for you: <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/MOS+in+12edo">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/MOS+in+12edo</a></p><p>If anyone has complaints about the terminology, now&apos;s your chance...</p><p>&gt; And a 2nd question - if I were to use Greek tetrachords (actually I want Babylonian) does one simply repeat the structure going up or down from the 4 note span?</p><p>I was under the impression that the usual thing to do is arrange the tetrachords so that the scale repeats at the octave. This requires some &quot;conjunct&quot; tetrachords (which share a note), and some &quot;disjunct&quot; tetrachords (which are separated by 9/8).</p><p>So if your tetrachord is D F F# G a possible scale would be:</p><p>D F F# G A C C# D F F# G A C C# D<br/>|------| |------|------| |------|<br/>    disjunct conjunct disjunct</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=104337 href="#104337">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2012 10:10:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Is it possible to construct a MOS scale in 12 equal?</p><p>I think you&apos;re going to be disappointed. The more interesting-looking<br/>MOSs of 12 EDO are the usual scales and modes you&apos;re used to.</p><p>If you have an ET, you can use Scala to do this instead of doing the<br/>chaining yourself. From the menu:<br/>--&gt; Tools --&gt; Moment of Symmetry</p><p>Choose parent size of 12, and then you can show, for example, all<br/>generators and scale sizes. You&apos;ll get a lot with a generator of 1<br/>step, or of 11, which gives you such exciting scales as C C# D D# E F<br/>F# G G# A A# C. I don&apos;t find those to be particularly interesting, so<br/>I don&apos;t consider them. YMMV.</p><p>Some of the more interesting ones are the following. (Note: The first<br/>line is the scale steps, the second is the number of steps in<br/>subsequent intervals. Also, I took some stuff out and added the lines<br/>with --&gt; at the front.)</p><p>Generator 5:</p><p>  3:  0 3 5 8 10 12 = 2L+3S<br/>(5)   3 2 3 2 2<br/>--&gt; C Eb F Ab Bb C</p><p>  4:  0 1 3 5 6 8 10 12 = 5L+2S<br/>(7)   1 2 2 1 2 2 2<br/>--&gt; C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C</p><p>Generator 7:</p><p>  3:  0 2 4 7 9 12 = 2L+3S<br/>(5)   2 2 3 2 3<br/>--&gt; C D E G A C</p><p>  4:  0 2 4 6 7 9 11 12 = 5L+2S<br/>(7)   2 2 2 1 2 2 1<br/>--&gt; C D E F# G A B C</p><p>Notice, though, that a mode of an MOS is also an MOS. Also note that<br/>if you have the same step sequences, starting on a different step, you<br/>end up with transpositions.</p><p>2L+3S with generator 5 can be considered Cm, minus the 2nd and 5th,<br/>while 2L+3S with generator 7 (even though it starts on a different<br/>note) can be considered Em, minus the 2nd and 5th: In other words,<br/>they&apos;re transpositions of modes of each other.</p><p>Likewise with 5L+2S.</p><p>So you can safely reduce the number of MOSs to two:<br/>C D E G A C<br/>and<br/>C D E F# G A B C<br/>...and their modes. Those are two of the most-used scales in the world.</p><p>Does it have to be an MOS, or does it just have to be something<br/>interesting in 12-equal? If you want a bunch of interesting scales<br/>based on 12-equal, you might try this:</p><p>Create a new 12-equal scale. (Shift-alt-E, enter &quot;12&quot;.)</p><p>Hit the &quot;Play&quot; button on the toolbar (it has a little keyboard on it).<br/>That brings up the chromatic clavier.</p><p>Hit the &quot;Mode&quot; button on the bottom of the chromatic clavier.</p><p>Scala automatically provides a list of modes that fit a scale size of<br/>12, ranging from two notes to all 12. They&apos;re not necessarily MOSs,<br/>but they might prove interesting. The Messiaen modes have a unique<br/>sound, for example. And once you&apos;ve selected one, you can try it on<br/>the clavier before choosing it for your composition.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=104347 href="#104347">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2012 4:10:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Carl, Keenan, and Jake</p><p>Everything said was invaluable and I really appreciate the page on the wiki<br/>Keenan.</p><p>To give a little background - what the (unpaid) commission is for a 5 to 7<br/>minute piece for flute and electronics.
