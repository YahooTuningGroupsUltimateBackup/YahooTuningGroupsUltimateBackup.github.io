In strict JI, some of the intervals will be<br/>very close to consonant intervals . . . for example, a moderately<br/>beating perfect fifth. Not necessarily what I&apos;d call a dissonance,<br/>despite its very complex ratio. What microtemperament does is to make<br/>this, as well as the consonant (pure) perfect fifths, all identical<br/>to one another, all beating very, very slowly. Same for other<br/>consonant intervals. If you relish the differences, and present them<br/>in a way that is likely to be meaningful to the listener, then<br/>microtemperament is not for you! Kraig Grady is in complete agreement<br/>with you about the Eikosany. However, someone else may enjoy the way<br/>the consonant tetrads are connected to one another in the Eikosany,<br/>and may not wish to make direct use of the &quot;dissonances&quot; that are<br/>near-consonances. For such a person, working in a microtempered<br/>system could be preferable, say, if they sought to modulate some of<br/>the tetrad-connecting motifs, or work in some interesting<br/>counterpoint with multiple harmonic implications, or . . . I could<br/>think of various other things.</p><p>But I don&apos;t think temperament in any way necessarily &quot;destroys the<br/>original scale&quot;. For example take the diatonic scale. You&apos;ll see lots<br/>of JI advocates saying that the &quot;true&quot; Western diatonic scale C D E F<br/>G A B C is 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1. As far as I am<br/>concerned, this is hogwash. In 99.9% of the Western music written in<br/>the diatonic scale, D-A is treated as a consonance just like any<br/>other perfect fifth. Yet the JI ratios tell you that D-A is 40:27,<br/>very rough in comparison will all those pure 3:2 fifths in the scale.<br/>The musical reality is that, since the advent of triadic harmony,<br/>virtually no instrument was ever tuned to the &quot;JI diatonic&quot; scale.<br/>Temperament, adaptive JI, or various shadings in-between were<br/>naturally and intuitively adopted as the desire for triadic harmony<br/>began to dominate the Western musical style. So here is a case where,<br/>I feel, strict JI &quot;destroys the original scale&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;d keep my options open. Overall, temperament tends to<br/>smooth out the melodies, reduce the number of interval sizes, and<br/>(for me) make composing a lot easier, more direct, more natural, and<br/>more fun. On the other hand, if you like to take a more cerebral<br/>approach to composing, then the types of challenges the Eikosany<br/>presents may be just the thing for you.</p></div><h3><a id=26913 href="#26913">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2001 7:15:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., kalleaho@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; I understand that with microtemperament one can achieve greater<br/>&gt; number of consonant intervals in a scale that is originally tuned in<br/>&gt; strict Just Intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This can be a great method for generating new and interesting scales<br/>&gt; but doesn&apos;t it destroy the structure of the original scale?</p><p>This is a very good question.

However, the answer is yes--<br/>introducing approximations increases the flexibility of harmonic<br/>relationships and thereby changes the structure. The question is<br/>really best understood in terms of group theory.</p><p>The intervals of any form of just intonation are by definition<br/>positive rational numbers, and so an element of the abelian group of<br/>positive rationals under multiplication (since our hearing, and hence<br/>musical structure, is multiplicative.) We are never really interested<br/>in all rational numbers, but can content ourselves with a finitely<br/>generated subgroup--for one easy example, the group G of all the<br/>numbers of the form 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a, b and c are integers,<br/>are the numbers generated by the first three primes, 2, 3 and 5.</p><p>An approximate tuning system can very often be seen as a (subset of<br/>a) group homomorphism to a group of smaller rank, and most<br/>significantly to a group of rank 1. For another easy example, the<br/>rank 3 free group G can be sent to a rank 1 free group by a<br/>homomorphism h12(2) = 12, h12(3) = 19, h12(5) = 28. A subset of 88<br/>contiguous elements of this group associated to notes tuned as usual<br/>by setting g12(1) = 440 hz, g12(2) = 2*440 hz, g12(3) = 2^19/12*440<br/>hz, g12(5) = 2^28/12*440 hz is the standard keyboard.</p><p>Any such homomorphism is defined by its kernel, which are the<br/>elements sent to the identity. In the case of h12, the kernel is<br/>spanned by 81/80 (the diatonic comma) and 128/125 (the great diesis),<br/>where we have h12(81/80) = h12(128/125) = 0. A tuning system which<br/>does not contain the diatonic comma in its kernel (and this includes<br/>just intonation!) will have a structure quite different that what<br/>musicians normally expect. On the other hand one that does, such as<br/>what we get from the 19 or 31 tone system, will seem more &quot;normal&quot;.</p><p>Consider the system h72(2) = 72, h72(3) = 114, h72(5) = 167, h72(7) =<br/>202, h72(11) = 249 (the last two values are irrelevant here, but they<br/>do no harm and they cover the range which makes the 72 system<br/>interesting.) This 72 system has a 12 system tuning embedded in it,<br/>so we could suppose that structurally they are very similar. However,<br/>intersecting the kernels shows they are remotely related; in<br/>particular h72(81/80) = 1 and h72(128/125) = 3, the second is not so<br/>important but the first shows that the 72 system is fundamentally<br/>different in structure from the 12 system. In contrast, h31(2) = 31,<br/>h31(3) = 49, h31(5) = 72, h31(7) = 87 and h31(11) = 107 *does* have<br/>the property that h31(81/80) = 0; and while h31(128/125) = 1 we still<br/>find h31 is much closer in structre to h12 than is h72.</p></div><h3><a id=27137 href="#27137">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2001 11:00:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., kalleaho@m... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I understand that with microtemperament one can achieve greater<br/>&gt; &gt; number of consonant intervals in a scale that is originally tuned<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; strict Just Intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This can be a great method for generating new and interesting<br/>&gt; scales<br/>&gt; &gt; but doesn&apos;t it destroy the structure of the original scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you finally get to the point where you can&apos;t tell the<br/>&gt; difference, the question becomes moot.</p><p>That&apos;s what a _micro_temperament is.

An otonal chord played with<br/>such inharmonic timbres with a fixed spectrum will<br/>result in very stong, clear virtual pitch, i.e. root.<br/>Combinational tones can only enhance this effect<br/>when JI tunings are used. This kind of rootedness<br/>is not possible to obtain with inharmonic tunings.<br/>Although Sethares has done a great deal of<br/>valuable work on the relationship between tuning<br/>and timbre, his is only a piece of the puzzle.</p></div><h3><a id=27146 href="#27146">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>8/18/2001 12:17:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jacky_ligon@y... wrote:<br/>&gt; I would like to respectfully toss in my two cents values here to<br/>say<br/>&gt; that where there is discussion of what is *just* about intervals<br/>&gt; without some healthy inclusion of what this all means relative to<br/>the<br/>&gt; infinity of possible timbres (acoustic and electronic), rhythm (or<br/>&gt; their use compositionally in time) and musical examples to show for<br/>&gt; final proofs, that much of this fails to have meaning in the real<br/>&gt; world of *music* and *music creation*.</p><p>Suppose you woke up one morning in a cranky mood and decided to make<br/>music on a set of pitches chosen rather randomly, or according to<br/>some clever method of your own.

You mean spew out thousands of tunings at random and let<br/>composers decide between them??? I beg to differ. Certain properties<br/>of tunings are known to be of more interest to more microtonal<br/>composers (and listeners). If I&apos;m getting those wrong, then I hope<br/>people will tell me how.

But<br/>that would allow 12-tET to be considered just, on a suitable<br/>instrument (You didn&apos;t address this from last time).

If 2 cent errors<br/>were Just a hundred years ago, then they still are today (no matter<br/>what instrument they are on).</p><p>And when did people start to consider temperaments that had errors<br/>less than 2 cents, _as_ temperaments. I&apos;d guess schismic would have<br/>been the first (as used on the Dinarra).</p><p>The sharp distinction you are trying to make between just tuning and<br/>temperament is a purely mathematical one, one that can be revealed by<br/>no listening and no measurement. I&apos;ll allow that the definition of<br/>temperament is a mathematical one. But since justness is defined<br/>perceptually, we must allow that a sufficiently gentle temperament can<br/>be just. The two concepts have a small overlap.

I&apos;d prefer to keep ratios of 9 below about 2.2 c and ratios<br/>of 11 below 1.8 c.

Besides,<br/>phase-locking is a purely theoretical concern at this point, since<br/>it requires beyond-run-of-the-mill electronic instruments to<br/>produce.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In so doing, you will be going against hundreds of years of usage<br/>&gt;&gt;of the term &quot;just&quot; -- a term used specifically to distinguish<br/>&gt;&gt;between tunings as accurate as can be made, and tunings featuring<br/>&gt;&gt;deliberate and purposeful errors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t believe so. Until the last 50 years or so there has been no<br/>&gt;difference between &quot;as accurate as can be made&quot; and &quot;within 2 cents<br/>&gt;either way&quot;.  The distinction never had to be faced.</p><p>Oh, Dave!  Bosanquet&apos;s 53-tET harmonium in 1875?  A whole genre of<br/>accurate meantone fifths not by counting beats, but by getting very<br/>accurate just thirds in 1575?  The idea that only modern man can<br/>distinguish 2-cent errors??</p><p>&gt;Now that it does, I&apos;m coming down on the side that says it&apos;s about<br/>&gt;how it sounds on the day, not what accuracy the instrument is<br/>&gt;capable of. If 2 cent errors were Just a hundred years ago, then<br/>&gt;they still are today (no matter what instrument they are on).</p><p>Take a step back!  We&apos;re making wonderful discoveries, but we&apos;re not<br/>privileged to any manifest destiny!  Ears have always been ears, and<br/>they will always be the highest court in music, and they ear can<br/>hear errors of 2 cents!</p><p>&gt;The sharp distinction you are trying to make between just tuning and<br/>&gt;temperament is a purely mathematical one, one that can be revealed<br/>&gt;by no listening and no measurement.</p><p>To the contrary, my opinion is that the difference between just and<br/>tempered is entirely perceptual, and I don&apos;t claim to have any model<br/>of it that allows me to tell without listening.</p><p>I also believe that the perceptual difference between temperament and<br/>JI goes beyond one of psychoacoustics.  Even if a bare sonority cannot<br/>be distinguished from just, if we want to claim that &quot;puns&quot; are<br/>interesting, we have to claim that the brain has some sort of access<br/>to the lattice, and by using an un-connected structure as a harmony<br/>we are tempering.  Fortunately, I don&apos;t think there are any sonorities<br/>which are psychoacoustically just _and_ severe enough, or in a<br/>sequence short enough to be heard as a pun.</p><p>&gt;&gt;This historic use includes quarter-comma<br/>&gt;&gt;meantone tuning, whose max error from 5-limit JI is 6 cents -- also<br/>&gt;&gt;within the random error of the guitar, by some accounts.  And today,<br/>&gt;&gt;we have found unanimously (as far as I know) that even 3-cent errors<br/>&gt;&gt;are musically important!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can you give me more info on that.</p><p>In one of Graham Breed&apos;s early posts, he listed his findings to that<br/>time.  Included was that differences of down to a cent were musically<br/>significant.  I&apos;ve done several listening tests involving these sorts<br/>of differences.  Others have certainly chimed in, but I don&apos;t want<br/>speak for anyone else from memory.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Get the error down to 1 cent, and I will join you in calling these<br/>&gt;&gt;tunings truly just in all circumstances (even though this would<br/>&gt;&gt;not be true for pianos, it takes a trained ear to hear errors less<br/>&gt;&gt;than a cent on a piano -- such errors are reported only as subtle<br/>&gt;&gt;differences in the instrument&apos;s timbre).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But you&apos;re not talking here about playing music. You&apos;re talking<br/>&gt;about maximally sustained dyads specifically for tuning it.</p><p>I am most definitely talking about music.  What makes a good piano<br/>tuning &quot;good&quot;?</p><p>&gt;In actual music much larger errors in 7-limit intervals are<br/>&gt;undetectable by most listeners.</p><p>They are?  Maybe the difference between 12-tET and 5-limit JI is<br/>undetectable to the man on the street, without training.</p><p>I think the best Barbershop quartets tune complete chords to an<br/>accuracy of about a cent... a finding supported by an FFT I once<br/>did on a typical professional Barbershop performance.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d prefer to keep ratios of 9 below about 2.2 c and ratios<br/>&gt;of 11 below 1.8 c. Which is one reason why I&apos;m pretty skeptical<br/>&gt;about the idea of a guitar that&apos;s 13-limit or higher. But then we<br/>&gt;have got the effect of otonal context masking large errors at<br/>&gt;higher limits.</p><p>Above the 7-limit, I think we start to get into the situation where<br/>not all bare dyads have low-enough harmonic entropy to be accurately<br/>tuned.</p><p>.x?  Significant digits, man!</p><p>Jon Catler&apos;s music is proof positive of the 13-limit guitar.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m happy to refine the number downwards (and even to make it<br/>&gt;different for different consonances), but I can&apos;t understand this<br/>&gt;business of wanting to make it smaller the better the accuracy of<br/>&gt;the  instrument.</p><p>Sounds like you want the laws of nature to hold for all reference<br/>frames!  The speed of light may, but the length of your error yard<br/>stick does not, I say.</p><p>&gt; I really value this discussion.

Only I was wrong. The sqrt(2)<br/>factor is as true of the max absolute error as it is of the RMS. You<br/>can try the experiment for yourself in a spreadsheet or whatever.<br/>Generate two parallel lists of random numbers (say 100) in a normal<br/>(bell curve) distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation<br/>(i.e. RMS error) of 1. Add corresponding numbers from each list and<br/>then find the MA and RMS errors of the original lists and those of the<br/>list of sums.

I&apos;m guessing that the errors in Blackjack are roughly<br/>normally distributed.</p><p>&gt; &gt;You say justness occurs when the beats cannot be further reduced.<br/>&gt; &gt;But that would allow 12-tET to be considered just, on a suitable<br/>&gt; &gt;instrument (You didn&apos;t address this from last time).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What type of instrument?</p><p>Any instrument with fixed 12-tET tuning.</p><p>&gt; In the case of a 12-tET guitar, errors<br/>&gt; can (and are everyday) reduced by bending notes [by my experience],<br/>&gt; tweaking the open-string tuning [I have been told], and choosing<br/>&gt; certain positions over others [Don Slepian demonstrated this to<br/>&gt; me].</p><p>This is another matter, outside of what we are discussing. If you can<br/>bend 12-TET to just, you can bend anything.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And many (most?) people don&apos;t want their JI to be phase-locked,<br/>they<br/>&gt; &gt;actually prefer slow beating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think either of us have any data here at all.  Besides,<br/>&gt; phase-locking is a purely theoretical concern at this point, since<br/>&gt; it requires beyond-run-of-the-mill electronic instruments to<br/>&gt; produce.</p><p>During the era of top-octave-divider organs, phase locking at small<br/>whole-number ratios was very easy to do, and I suspect that designers<br/>took pains to avoid it. Of course that might simply be because they<br/>were trying to approximate 12-tET. They certainly didn&apos;t bother tuning<br/>12-TET any closer than +- 1c, when they easily could have done.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;In so doing, you will be going against hundreds of years of usage<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;of the term &quot;just&quot; -- a term used specifically to distinguish<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;between tunings as accurate as can be made, and tunings featuring<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;deliberate and purposeful errors.</p><p>I would change that to -- a term used specifically to distinguish<br/>between tunings as accurate as can be _heard_, and tunings featuring<br/>deliberate and purposeful errors.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t believe so. Until the last 50 years or so there has been no<br/>&gt; &gt;difference between &quot;as accurate as can be made&quot; and &quot;within 2 cents<br/>&gt; &gt;either way&quot;.  The distinction never had to be faced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, Dave!  Bosanquet&apos;s 53-tET harmonium in 1875?  A whole genre of<br/>&gt; accurate meantone fifths not by counting beats, but by getting very<br/>&gt; accurate just thirds in 1575?</p><p>But do we know how sucessful these methods actually were, and how long<br/>the tunings lasted, on the instruments of the day.</p><p>&gt; The idea that only modern man can<br/>&gt; distinguish 2-cent errors??</p><p>Huh? I didn&apos;t say that. It was the accuracy of the instruments I was<br/>referring to. But I&apos;ll accept that I was wrong about that. How<br/>accurate were they in actual use?</p><p>See folks, don&apos;t assume I&apos;m a &quot;noted authority&quot;. There are huge gaps<br/>in my knowledge. A noted authority? What a frightening idea!

Ears have always been ears, and<br/>&gt; they will always be the highest court in music, and they ear can<br/>&gt; hear errors of 2 cents!</p><p>Sure. Again, I was talking about the accuracy of the instruments. And<br/>this when in actual use (not 10 seconds after they were tuned by an<br/>expert). Read the note at the end of<br/><a href="http://www.izzy.net/~jc/PSTInfo/fretbd.html">http://www.izzy.net/~jc/PSTInfo/fretbd.html</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;The sharp distinction you are trying to make between just tuning<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament is a purely mathematical one, one that can be revealed<br/>&gt; &gt;by no listening and no measurement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To the contrary, my opinion is that the difference between just and<br/>&gt; tempered is entirely perceptual, and I don&apos;t claim to have any model<br/>&gt; of it that allows me to tell without listening.</p><p>Your [paraphrased] &quot;as accurately as the instrument technology will<br/>allow&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with hearing, and yet you have<br/>said it will affect your judgement of what is just. So you seem to<br/>contradict yourself when you say that the difference is _entirely_<br/>perceptual.</p><p>&gt; I also believe that the perceptual difference between temperament<br/>and<br/>&gt; JI goes beyond one of psychoacoustics.  Even if a bare sonority<br/>cannot<br/>&gt; be distinguished from just, if we want to claim that &quot;puns&quot; are<br/>&gt; interesting, we have to claim that the brain has some sort of access<br/>&gt; to the lattice, and by using an un-connected structure as a harmony<br/>&gt; we are tempering.</p><p>Oh sure. Whether you call them &quot;puns&quot; or not, and whether or not we<br/>keep track of the lattice in any sense (which I doubt), I think I know<br/>what you mean. I understand Paul Erlich agrees with you here, and<br/>thinks he is disagreeing with me.</p><p>But all I am claiming about microtemperament is that most listeners on<br/>hearing most music created for the original rational scale will be<br/>none the wiser when it is played in a microtemperament. As you say,<br/>the person in the street can&apos;t tell the difference between Pachelbel&apos;s<br/>canon played in 5-limit JI or 12-tET (with 16 cent errors!).</p><p>But as Paul points out, it doesn&apos;t work in the other direction. If you<br/>compose for the microtemperament, it may not work in the rational<br/>scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;This historic use includes quarter-comma<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;meantone tuning, whose max error from 5-limit JI is 6 cents --<br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;within the random error of the guitar, by some accounts.  And<br/>today,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;we have found unanimously (as far as I know) that even 3-cent<br/>errors<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;are musically important!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Can you give me more info on that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In one of Graham Breed&apos;s early posts, he listed his findings to that<br/>&gt; time.</p><p>Grahams reply in<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_26876.html#27331">/tuning/topicId_26876.html#27331</a><br/>doesn&apos;t cause me to alter my position. But it was very interesting.<br/>Thanks Graham. I&apos;ll push my schismic temperaments closer to precise<br/>4:7s and further from precise 2:3s. What&apos;s the most accurate fourth<br/>you find acceptable as the generator?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Get the error down to 1 cent, and I will join you in calling these<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;tunings truly just in all circumstances.</p><p>I&apos;ll settle for 90% of circumstances, and await further evidence<br/>before I shift from my 2 to 3 cents stance. There certainly wouldn&apos;t<br/>be much to be gained in guitar design, from a microtemperament with<br/>only 1 cent errors, except perhaps with schismic at the 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; I think the best Barbershop quartets tune complete chords to an<br/>&gt; accuracy of about a cent... a finding supported by an FFT I once<br/>&gt; did on a typical professional Barbershop performance.</p><p>I severely doubt it. Unless you really know what you&apos;re doing, an FFT<br/>can easily exagerate the harmonicity of a waveform. At 250 Hz you&apos;d<br/>need a sample 7 seconds long to have a resolution of 1 cent. Can<br/>someone else confirm or deny?</p><p>&gt; .x?  Significant digits, man!</p><p>To describe this guitar design process mathematically, I need to draw<br/>sharp boundaries somewhere and so the decimal place _is_ significant.<br/>Also, some folks complain about 2 decimal places of cents when<br/>specifying optimum generators, but they should understand that the<br/>generator might need to be iterated 20 times to produce an<br/>approximation to some SWNR. In this case a 0.05 cent change in the<br/>generator will produce a 1 cent change in the approximate SWNR.</p><p>&gt; Jon Catler&apos;s music is proof positive of the 13-limit guitar.</p><p>And as Paul said, almost certainly has 2 or 3 cent variations due to<br/>finger pressure.</p><p>But these variations do not detract from the music. And, I claim, nor<br/>would a microtemperament with similar errors.</p><p>&gt; Sounds like you want the laws of nature to hold for all reference<br/>&gt; frames!</p><p>Why not?</p><p>&gt; The speed of light may, but the length of your error yard<br/>&gt; stick does not, I say.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what this means when translated to the topic of our<br/>discussion.

If a<br/>&gt;new method of guitar construction and playing was invented tomorrow,<br/>&gt;that cost no more to build and was accurate to 0.5 cent, would that<br/>&gt;suddenly make all other guitars non-just? Of course not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As you know, I believe that justness should be perceptually defined.</p><p>Me too!  In fact, I&apos;m taking this farther than you.  You want to sum<br/>over all the different instruments to get some kind of abstraction...<br/>the tuning is just or not.  Except you&apos;re just arbitrarily picking<br/>the guitar, and a number, and using that.  You haven&apos;t shown any<br/>elegant way to get your abstraction.</p><p>I say tuning is relative to the instrument.  I haven&apos;t shown any<br/>elegant way to get numbers either.  But if you want to ignore<br/>instruments entirely... the worst case is the bass drum... if you<br/>want to use the best case, then there isn&apos;t any such thing as a<br/>just guitar at all!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;If we go by the RMS error it will only be 1.4 times (or something<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;like that).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Where did you get that number?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Basic statistics and measurement theory. Only I was wrong. The<br/>&gt;sqrt(2) factor is as true of the max absolute error as it is of the<br/>&gt;RMS. You can try the experiment for yourself in a spreadsheet or<br/>&gt;whatever.  Generate two parallel lists of random numbers (say 100)<br/>&gt;in a normal (bell curve) distribution with a mean of zero and a<br/>&gt;standard deviation (i.e. RMS error) of 1. Add corresponding numbers<br/>&gt;from each list and then find the MA and RMS errors of the original<br/>&gt;lists and those of the list of sums. In general it&apos;s pythagoras,<br/>&gt;total_err ~= sqrt(err1^2 + err2^2).</p><p>Cool.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In the case of a 12-tET guitar, errors can (and are everyday)<br/>&gt;&gt;reduced by bending notes [by my experience], tweaking the open-<br/>&gt;&gt;string tuning [I have been told], and choosing certain positions<br/>&gt;&gt;over others [Don Slepian demonstrated this to me].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is another matter, outside of what we are discussing. If<br/>&gt;you can bend 12-TET to just, you can bend anything.</p><p>I think it addresses the reality of 12-tET guitars not being<br/>considered just by my definition quite well.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;And many (most?) people don&apos;t want their JI to be phase-locked,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;they actually prefer slow beating.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t think either of us have any data here at all.  Besides,<br/>&gt;&gt;phase-locking is a purely theoretical concern at this point, since<br/>&gt;&gt;it requires beyond-run-of-the-mill electronic instruments to<br/>&gt;&gt;produce.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;During the era of top-octave-divider organs, phase locking at small<br/>&gt;whole-number ratios was very easy to do, and I suspect that<br/>&gt;designers took pains to avoid it.</p><p>Baldwin must have; I&apos;ve recorded several hours of music in 7-limit<br/>JI on a Baldwin octave-divider organ without any problems.</p><p>&gt;Of course that might simply be because they were trying to<br/>&gt;approximate 12-tET. They certainly didn&apos;t bother tuning 12-TET any<br/>&gt;closer than +- 1c, when they easily could have done.</p><p>The octave divider organ I used was tuned by means of 12 tiny<br/>screws.  Are you thinking of a specific example?</p><p>&gt;I would change that to -- a term used specifically to distinguish<br/>&gt;between tunings as accurate as can be _heard_, and tunings featuring<br/>&gt;deliberate and purposeful errors.</p><p>I&apos;ll agree to that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t believe so. Until the last 50 years or so there has been<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;no difference between &quot;as accurate as can be made&quot; and &quot;within 2<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;cents either way&quot;.  The distinction never had to be faced.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Oh, Dave!  Bosanquet&apos;s 53-tET harmonium in 1875?  A whole genre of<br/>&gt;&gt;accurate meantone fifths not by counting beats, but by getting very<br/>&gt;&gt;accurate just thirds in 1575?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But do we know how sucessful these methods actually were, and how<br/>&gt;long the tunings lasted, on the instruments of the day.</p><p>No tuning lasts more than a few days on historical keyboard<br/>instruments.  That&apos;s why they tuned them every day!!</p><p>The success of the method depends on the tuner.  I guess we&apos;ll<br/>never know how those people did.  But we have a direct line to<br/>them through people alive today, still working the same procedures,<br/>and working them to fractions of a cent.</p><p>&gt;See folks, don&apos;t assume I&apos;m a &quot;noted authority&quot;. There are huge<br/>&gt;gaps in my knowledge. A noted authority? What a frightening idea!<br/>&gt;(but of course my ego just laps it up :-)</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way!  I&apos;m not a noted authority either.<br/>But, I have spent a lot of time with various acoustic keyboard<br/>instruments.  OTOH, I have absolutely no knowledge of the guitar.</p><p>&gt;Sure. Again, I was talking about the accuracy of the instruments.<br/>&gt;And this when in actual use (not 10 seconds after they were tuned<br/>&gt;by an expert).

I wonder how rotating the neck was causing a<br/>change?</p><p>Now we just need a corresponding site for intervals, and we&apos;ll<br/>have something useful for our discussion.  I have a strobe tuner,<br/>but no guitar.  :(</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The sharp distinction you are trying to make between just tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;and temperament is a purely mathematical one, one that can be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;revealed by no listening and no measurement.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;To the contrary, my opinion is that the difference between just and<br/>&gt;&gt;tempered is entirely perceptual, and I don&apos;t claim to have any model<br/>&gt;&gt;of it that allows me to tell without listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Your [paraphrased] &quot;as accurately as the instrument technology will<br/>&gt;allow&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with hearing,</p><p>It does when the instrument must be tuned by a human!</p><p>&gt;and yet you have said it will affect your judgement of what is just.<br/>&gt;So you seem to contradict yourself when you say that the difference<br/>&gt;is _entirely_ perceptual.</p><p>The confusion may result from a step I&apos;m taking tacitly here.<br/>Actually, we did discuss it... the human ear is the final judge of<br/>pitch.  My point is that people already tune their instruments to<br/>a greater level of accuracy than our best algoritms have at guessing<br/>the pitch of complex tones with some degree of inharmonicity.  The<br/>idea of getting strange results from my definition by setting<br/>up a synth with a just tuning to a greater degree of accuracy than<br/>we can hear... is a fallacy, since I define accuracy by what we<br/>can hear -- not by what a computer says the accuracy is.</p><p>&gt;Oh sure. Whether you call them &quot;puns&quot; or not, and whether or not we<br/>&gt;keep track of the lattice in any sense (which I doubt),</p><p>At least we all (myself, Paul, Pehrson, you) agree on this doubt.</p><p>&gt;But all I am claiming about microtemperament is that most listeners<br/>&gt;on hearing most music created for the original rational scale will<br/>&gt;be none the wiser when it is played in a microtemperament.</p><p>Agreed!</p><p>&gt;But as Paul points out, it doesn&apos;t work in the other direction. If<br/>&gt;you compose for the microtemperament, it may not work in the<br/>&gt;rational scale.</p><p>Yeah. . . . I doubt puns will be a problem for our definition of<br/>just intonation.

Unless you really know what you&apos;re doing, an<br/>&gt;FFT can easily exagerate the harmonicity of a waveform.</p><p>I don&apos;t, though I am aware of this.</p><p>&gt;At 250 Hz you&apos;d need a sample 7 seconds long to have a resolution<br/>&gt;of 1 cent.

I&apos;m not denying the 3 (Denny said 6) cent fudge factor on<br/>guitars.</p><p>&gt;But these variations do not detract from the music.

Even Turkish music with its famed microdivisions<br/>of the tone never uses all those divisions in the same scale-- and they aren&apos;t tuned<br/>according to theory anyway. Why?

But the questions remain: Why didn&apos;t the culture poop out<br/>13-limit JI in the first place? and why has no extant culture ever done so? I think it&apos;s<br/>because people don&apos;t start singing music because a theorist told them to do it; they<br/>sing (and play instruments) because they enjoy it. Any tuning structure that requires<br/>extensive theory to explain will never catch on in practice, even if the culture buys<br/>into the explanatory nature of the theory.

I described<br/>this at the time as the sense that the harmonics were floating over my<br/>fingers, guiding them.  This was definitely a new experience of the<br/>potential available in 12et.

Of course, theory very often comes *after* practice and<br/>just as often has nothing at all to do with practice.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Why didn&apos;t the<br/>&gt; culture poop out<br/>&gt; &gt; 13-limit JI in the first place? and why has no extant culture ever<br/>&gt; done so?

And perhaps &quot;comprehensive&quot; might be clearer in a<br/>way.</p><p>The meaning of the word &quot;rational&quot; it seems to me might be divided along<br/>intellectual-political lines.  Rational is commonly used to mean something<br/>like &quot;analytical&quot; and those who acuse others of being irrational are often<br/>acusing a thought process that can not be analyzed, &quot;does not compute&quot;.  And<br/>in fact rational does seem to have its origins in computation, according to<br/>Joseph T. Shipley, Dictionary of Word Origins:</p><p>    L. ratio to calculate, to figure; hence to figure out, to reason;<br/>    whence Eng. ratio; rational;</p><p>so maybe that is even correct usage.  However experience with near-just<br/>intervals being more easily assimilable leads me to think of rational as<br/>referring to thought process that fall together in good ratios, i.e. things<br/>that mesh.  What meshes in a culture is a different thing from what meshes<br/>in a theoretical analysis.</p><p>So perhaps it is open to question whether folk tradition or theory<br/>rationalizes.  I would perhaps accuse &quot;theory&quot; of rationalizing folk<br/>tradition, and perhaps sometimes that happens in the worst (e.g.<br/>psychoanalytic) sense of rationalize, which as I see it involves making<br/>rational at the expense of something like &quot;truth&quot;.  So I might agree with<br/>Paul that it is theory that rationalizes.  But you may be onto another<br/>meaning of rationalize, which may be something that cultures do in order to<br/>assimilate.</p><p>Theory is sometimes too skeletal and over-focused, tending toward isolating<br/>things more than integrating them.  The musician&apos;s cultural function is<br/>partly to integrate.  That which is integral is complete, comprehensive.<br/>What has been comprehended becomes thus comprehensive, and what is<br/>comprehensive will be more comprehensible to another with a similar<br/>background.</p><p>from Shipley again:</p><p>    comprehend, to take together, may mean to understand or to include;<br/>    the second sense is dominant in _comprehensive_</p><p>and so this is relating comprehensiveness to inclusiveness.  Comprehension<br/>likewise involves an assimilation of knowledge, which involves an inclusion<br/>within oneself and one&apos;s structures.  It is not an analytic thing.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=46077 href="#46077">ðŸ”—</a>Justin Weaver &#x3C;improvist@usa.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2003 4:41:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     L. ratio to calculate, to figure; hence to figure out, to reason;<br/>&gt;     whence Eng. ratio; rational;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     comprehend, to take together, may mean to understand or to include;<br/>&gt;     the second sense is dominant in _comprehensive_<br/>&gt;</p><p>Since I wasted three years of my life getting an MA in functional linguistics, I feel<br/>obliged to throw in here that the meaning of words can&apos;t be found in the dictionary,<br/>since meaning is constructed through use in discourse and is indeed constantly<br/>reconstructed.

Like adaptive JI<br/>&gt;&gt; as I<br/>&gt;&gt; understand it, the horizontal direction would be free, but since<br/>&gt;&gt; the scale<br/>&gt;&gt; is fixed, what is actually &quot;free&quot; would then be the JI &quot;conception&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; that is<br/>&gt;&gt; guiding the improvisation/composition.  So with successive chords,<br/>&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;underlying&quot; JI might find ways to shift so that more notes are<br/>&gt;&gt; close to the<br/>&gt;&gt; fixed scale, taking into account what might be improved by dropping<br/>&gt;&gt; various<br/>&gt;&gt; notes from a chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hmm . . . can you give an example?</p><p>Well, ok, but to given an example I have to become more &quot;theoretically<br/>conscious&quot; than I have been.  So I have started to work on this, and should<br/>get back to you sometime in the next year.  ;)</p><p>Meanwhile it seems to me that what I am saying breaks down into two aspects:<br/>(1) that the harmonic series may directly inform jazz chord choice,<br/>including choice of which notes to include and which to omit<br/>(2) that comma-sized or perhaps smaller shifts in the pitch of an<br/>&quot;underlying&quot; harmonic series (i.e. relative to the imposed 12et) might make<br/>different harmonics closer to 12et notes, and if so, some &quot;adaptive&quot; process<br/>might &quot;adjust&quot; this shift in order to make different chord possibilities<br/>available for &quot;consideration&quot;.</p><p>So if this breakdown is correct, then which is it that you wanted an example<br/>of?</p><p>I suspect that (1) is probably nothing new to people on this list, perhaps<br/>all too obvious, although of course there might be subtleties to work out.</p><p>Meanwhile, preliminary theoretical investigation of (2) seems to indicate<br/>that there is very little shifting available that helps bring alternate<br/>harmonics closer to 12et.  And chances are that most people on this list<br/>already know this too.  But I&apos;ll go ahead and continue anyway.</p><p>Using my old 12-inch slide rule, for the heck of it (something I have always<br/>wondered about doing, and taking advantage of the fact that log10 of 2 is<br/>almost exactly .3), I was able to make visible the relation between the<br/>harmonic series up to 35 or so and the 12et scale.  This approach had its<br/>limitations however, and next time I&apos;ll try to learn how to use scala first.<br/>With a fairly &quot;strict&quot; definition of what is &quot;close&quot; to 12et (which I didn&apos;t<br/>quantify precisely, because it was a visual judgement, but roughtly speaking<br/>I was throwing out harmonics that were 4 cents off or more), I found only 2<br/>different harmonic series subsets that are of much interest, those being:</p><p>    1 2 3 4 6 8 9 12 15 16 18 19 24 27 30 32</p><p>    1 2 3 4 6 8 9 12 16 17 18 19 24 27 32 34</p><p>and these are only distinct by the inclusion of multiples of 15 versus 17,<br/>and the shift required to bring one series versus the other very close to<br/>12et is slightly larger than what would be needed to bring harmonic 5 (and<br/>multiples) into the picture.</p><p>Meanwhile, looking for other subsets that would include the missing numbers<br/>5, 7, 11, 13 had the following results.  By creating the shift that allows<br/>multiples of 5 to be included, nothing else *besides* multiples of 5 is<br/>included.  For 7, 11, and 13 there were 3 distinct but very short<br/>close-to-12et harmonic series subsets:</p><p>    7 14 21 25 28 (no surprise here except for the 25)</p><p>    11 22 31? 33 35 (31 is more &quot;off&quot; than what I have been including)</p><p>    13 26 31</p><p>These additional sequences don&apos;t offer much in the way of big chords, though<br/>I suppose it might turn out these can be useful for sparse chords, and might<br/>also be useful if it turns out that having *one* note a little &quot;off&quot; is<br/>admissable, as a way of adding tension while preserving a sense of harmonic<br/>structure (in a strict sense).</p><p>I tried working on a chord progression, at first entirely by ear, and then<br/>reworked it with the help of the knowledge of the first 2 harmonic series<br/>subsets I listed above.  The final result was the following, wherein I made<br/>the base line be the 2nd harmonic because of the octaves I wanted to play in<br/>on the piano.  The chords are situated in the first two octaves above middle<br/>C.</p><p>    base        chord       approximate ratios<br/>    C           G/B/D/E     2:12:15:16:18<br/>    dn to F#    G/B/C#/D#   2:17:21:24:27 (the 21 is &quot;off&quot; in 12et)<br/>    up to D     A/C#/E/F    2:12:15:18:19<br/>    dn to E     G#/C#/F/A   2:20:27:34:42 (20 and 42 are &quot;off&quot; in 12et)</p><p>The 2nd and 4th chords above have one or two tones that are not as stricly<br/>close to 12et as all the rest, as noted above.  However, the net result has<br/>a surprising amount of consonance (though my piano needs a tune, so I hope<br/>this is accurate), and perhaps the consonance even worked well with the<br/>exceptional dissonant tones, in that the beating pattern itself you could<br/>say was fairly consonant, i.e. had some complexity but not too much.  In any<br/>case the knowledge of the harmonic series clearly helped me become conscious<br/>of more possible choices that might work, which I had somehow missed based<br/>on the knowledge already &quot;in my hand&quot; (and ears).  (There&apos;s a case of theory<br/>feeding into practice.)</p><p>In trying to make some sense out of the choices I was making in order to<br/>&quot;compose&quot; this short progression, I came up with the following:</p><p>    try to have a lot of fairly exact ratios<br/>    but avoid octaves and fifths<br/>    avoid minor 2nds by relocating one of the notes by an octave<br/>    prefer more motion in chord notes over less<br/>        (not necessarily further movements, but more notes moving)<br/>    allow in one or two inexact ratios in order to create tension</p><p>Curious, this experience gives me the impression that in a certain jazz<br/>aesthetic, what functions as &quot;resolution&quot; actually involves more tension,<br/>i.e. transitional chords should be milder, and final chords of a phrase<br/>should be more dissonant.

I was not measuring the chord intervals<br/>directly, but instead measuring the chord &quot;pitches&quot;.  Yes the entire chord<br/>is free to slide together as a unit, so although I mean pitches rather than<br/>intervals, pitch is really the wrong word because I mean something that is<br/>relative.
