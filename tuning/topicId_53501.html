Also<br/>some other lower notes are there too, all pure<br/>tones at various pitches with some beating between<br/>some of them too if you listen to it quietly.</p><p>It isn&apos;t bad enough to call it titinitus,<br/>just a really quiet sound, but now I know<br/>to look out for it I can hear the notes at<br/>any time if I pay particular attention to them.</p><p>So I wondered if some of the beats could<br/>be due to that.</p><p>So thought of a test for that, which is to<br/>play the same audio file back at different<br/>sample rates as I can do in Goldwave.<br/>If it was due to beating with any external<br/>source then the patterns would change in some<br/>complex way and the pitches and numbers<br/>of beats ditto.</p><p>However, that didn&apos;t happen. All the beats<br/>were still there as described, at different frequencies<br/>and with the beats slowed down as it went slower.<br/>E.g. that very slow beat low beat in the first note and<br/>the same pitch but a bit faster when the major<br/>third comes in - those sort of patterns<br/>are still recognisable as I change the pitch.</p><p>So I think they must be real, hard to see what<br/>other kind of effect could do that.</p><p>They are also more obvious when it is transposed<br/>down an octave. So here it is, the first clip,<br/>transposed down an octave just by changing the sample<br/>rate to 22050:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_seth_tr_-_oct.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_seth_tr_-_oct.mp3</a></p><p>Do you hear beats in it now? E.g. in the first note already.<br/>I hear really strong beats there at this pitch. Do you hear<br/>the slow wah wah beat right at the bottom of that chord<br/>of the partials for the first note, now at about one beat<br/>a second instead of the two beats per second it is at<br/>the higher pitch? Also the faster one higher up?<br/>Some more slow ones too in that note if you listen<br/>out for them.</p><p>Then there are loads of beats when the other notes come in.</p><p>The main note in my left ear is a pure tone btw, and pretty close<br/>to concert pitch, almost good enough<br/>to use as a tuning fork :-). I just had a go at<br/>comparing it with a reference tone and it is certainly<br/>very close. May be a couple of cents or so flat if anything.<br/>Not as much as 10 cents flat certainly. I think<br/>probably 2 cents or so.</p><p>When I used to practice the &apos;cello<br/>I could sometimes remember the tuning<br/>fork pitch from one day to the next<br/>so that I could whistle the note<br/>before I picked up the fork. This<br/>is probably why.</p><p>I just tested it singing an &apos;a&apos;<br/>tuned to the note in my ear, then played it on<br/>recorder and it was indeed an &apos;a&apos;.</p><p>Maybe I should hire myself out as a<br/>tuning fork :-).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=53511 href="#53511">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2004 7:03:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Interesting what you say about combination tones<br/>being non linear. Yes you can get them really<br/>strongly with two recorders played loudly<br/>with pure steady pitches, as a third !part&quot;<br/>sometimes unwelcome notes for the tune you are playing.</p><p>I&apos;ve wondered if a composer could exploit combinaiton<br/>tones to write a three part piece for two recorders<br/>(expect it has been done).<br/>However, that means you would have to play the music<br/>very loudly too at the correct loudness level<br/>to hear the third part as intended.</p><p>Yes, my soundcard is the SB Live! and<br/>I&apos;ve noticed before that it introduces<br/>distortions at discontintuities.</p><p>Here is a screen shot of a saw tooth:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/SBLive_saw_tooth.png">http://www.robertinventor.com/SBLive_saw_tooth.png</a></p><p>Can a high end soundcard reproduce even a discontinuity<br/>accurately? After all it requires an infinite<br/>fourier series to make a saw tooth so you would<br/>think it is quite a challenge, and just<br/>having e.g. a cut off of the frequencies at some level<br/>(even maybe beyond human hearing range)<br/>could mean it can&apos;t play a perfect<br/>saw tooth.</p><p>I hadn&apos;t thought of the effect this could<br/>have on other waveforms, but I suppose it<br/>is a harmonic distortion and if it happens<br/>at a discontinuity, maybe it can happen<br/>elsewhere to lesser degree.</p><p>I listen over headphones and the ones I use are<br/>reasonably good middle range ones (the Grado labs<br/>headphones).</p><p>I wonder if there is any way to find out<br/>whether particular beats that one hears<br/>are due to harmonic distortion or<br/>would be present anyway without it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=53513 href="#53513">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2004 11:23:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I wonder if there is any way to find out<br/>&gt; whether particular beats that one hears<br/>&gt; are due to harmonic distortion or<br/>&gt; would be present anyway without it.</p><p>Essentially, yes -- just lower the volume -- you&apos;ll be lowering the<br/>percentage of harmonic distortion in both the sound system and in<br/>your ears.
