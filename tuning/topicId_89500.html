But is it a sequence ?<br/>It breaks the x^5 - x^4 = 1/2 algorithm and it is not a Mohajira sequence, at least of that type.<br/>Would it be another sequence ?<br/>17 : 21 : 26 : 32 belongs typically to a Buzurg sequence, but it leaves it here for a Mohajira.<br/>A good option would be &quot;Buzurg 8&quot;, based on the differential coherence of :<br/> x^8 - x^7 = 1<br/>or if you prefer, where each new term is  x^8 = x^7 + 1<br/>It would converge normally towards 361.2794748 c., which is too high for your purpose, but by integrating a segment of a scale with a lower generator (mohajira), it would be an interesting alternative !<br/>Since 8 terms are needed to start a series, the choices are open.<br/>The basic Buzurg 8 series goes :<br/>(6, 7) 9 11 14 17 21 26 32 39 48 59 73 90 111 137 169 208 256 315 388 478 589 726 895 1103<br/>and is identical to your proposition up to 59 !<br/>Both have 3 octave repetitions : 9 : 11 &gt; 72 : 88,  or 26 : 32 &gt; 208 : 256<br/>Another option would be to start from 17, where the intervals are more regular :<br/>(6, 7, 9, 11, 13) 17 21 26 32 39 48 59 72 89 110 136 168 207 255 314 386 475 585 721 889<br/>octave repetitions : 17 : 21 &gt; 136 : 168<br/>All these series are cycling close to 10 tones /octave, not 17.<br/>For 17 there would be other sequences and one of them is Soria !<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>&gt; From 26 on, my series simply quotes yours.
