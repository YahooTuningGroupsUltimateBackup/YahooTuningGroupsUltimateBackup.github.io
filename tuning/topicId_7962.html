In general,<br/>&gt;though, I  really like the idea of nailing down one pitch and letting<br/>&gt;the others find themselves according to the harmonic needs of the<br/>&gt;sequence.  I&apos;ll  play with adding that capability to the program, and<br/>&gt;should have some  trial results by Monday, if not sooner.</p><p>This may sound silly, but would it help to have the equivalent of a set<br/>of &quot;open strings&quot;?  For example: on my violin the open strings are<br/>(usually): G D A E.  I don&apos;t have to play the strings open at all, but I<br/>can play them occasionally to make sure that my fingerings haven&apos;t<br/>drifted too far.  Maybe you can chose a small set of grounded pitches<br/>that are the equivalent, rather than grounding all of them or only one<br/>of them.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p><p>[This message contained attachments]</p></div>
