Is this<br/>&gt;correct?</p><p>Well, certainly a bit of stretching would make the major thirds better,<br/>unlike 12-tET, where it makes them worse. But the fifths in 22-tET are<br/>already sharp, and I don&apos;t want to make them even sharper by stretching.<br/>Only on the high notes on my low B string (it&apos;s a 7-string) is inharmonicity<br/>really a problem -- but I don&apos;t normally play there anyway.</p><p>&gt;Or is this more dictated by individual taste regarding 3rds?</p><p>The latter is what I&apos;m trying to imply. Certainly any use of ET for certain<br/>just intervals would imply a certain ideal amount of stretching, even with<br/>perfectly harmonic timbres. But it sounds like your friend is looking<br/>specifically for 12-tET-like thirds, not just ones.</p></div>
