Although, I sometimes like tunings with really high<br/>error (like 26edo as a meantone), because of the characteristic flavor<br/>they provide. In light of this, 59edo makes for an obvious example of<br/>a tuning that doubles as a near-optimal porcupine and an interestingly<br/>flat &quot;infra-meantone,&quot; as Margo Schulter once put it.</p><p>Are there any tunings in which one minor third provides for a good<br/>meantone, and another minor third provides for a good porcupine, and<br/>the difference is split more reasonably than with 59-tet?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2010 9:52:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Are there any tunings in which one minor third provides for a good<br/>&gt; meantone, and another minor third provides for a good porcupine, and<br/>&gt; the difference is split more reasonably than with 59-tet?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what minor thirds have to do with it, but &lt;293 466 669| works well as a porcupine tuning, and &lt;293 463 680| as a meantone tuning, where &quot;well&quot; of course is defined as aside from the fact that it has nearly 300 notes in an octave.

One &quot;use&quot; for such a thing is that it can be used to map meantone to porcupine and vice-versa, so that, for instance, porcupine could be bizarrely notated in standard meantone notation. I&apos;ve thought about how to use it for composition, but it doesn&apos;t seem too easy to get that to work. If someone else wants to try, I&apos;ll all in favor.</p></div>
