But I could also generate<br/>Shephard tones, and use it for an AP quiz as well, may<br/>give it a go for the new release.</p><p>I&apos;ve been working on pitch memory btw following that<br/>piano on-line book. What I&apos;ve been doing is to play a short<br/>phrase and then play it back immediately afterwards using<br/>the very short term memory you have for a musical note<br/>immediately after you hear it - that lasts for maybe a few<br/>seconds after the note (if you don&apos;t already have AP anyway).<br/>So - very complete with the exact timbre of the instrument<br/>etc.</p><p>So - then the idea is to reverse the process (not my idea, from the<br/>piano book) so you play the sound back in your mind immediately<br/>before you play it for real. That seems to involve AP because<br/>if you do it soon after then you find you play it back in your<br/>mind at the same pitch. I mean if you do it e.g. in the same<br/>session.</p><p>Then you may find that if you play it back in your mind even on<br/>the next day before you play it on the instrument, that it is still<br/>at the same pitch, at any rate that&apos;s what I find for one of my<br/>Teleman pieces - the first note is a G and if I play it back in my<br/>mind now, then play it on the instrument, then I hear the same<br/>pitch. The book advised one to do it that way first and not attempt<br/>to reproduce the pitch oneself until you get it in your mind<br/>- to avoid limitations that you can only play things in your mind<br/>that you can produce using your own vocal chords or whistle<br/>etc.</p><p>So anyway I did that for a bit, now if I play it in my mind,<br/>and whistle the pitch I heard in my mind to test that<br/>it really is my memory of pitch -  I always seem to come up with a G.</p><p>Also - could start the tune from almost any point in my mind now,<br/>so it seems, not very far from the point where I could<br/>whistle any pitch that occurs in the tune in pitch.<br/>By learning a variety of tunes one could fairly quickly<br/>reach the point where one can whistle any of the twelve<br/>pitches of 12t in pitch. For microtonal music one would<br/>need to learn some microtonal pieces similarly so that<br/>one can play them back in ones mind too.</p><p>But I can&apos;t yet instantly name a heard note<br/>as a G if it is the same pitch as the first note in the tune,<br/>I&apos;d have to play the tune in my mind first and then see if<br/>it sounds like the same note. Which one would think<br/>would be a very small step but it seems there is<br/>more to it than that. The mind is funny sometimes,<br/>how it works!</p><p>BTW though - I have a constant high pitched very quiet tone<br/>in one ear - like an internal tuning fork, I know that&apos;s often<br/>a nuisance but this is so quiet I only notice it when it is quiet<br/>around me. But it somewhat muddies the water when it<br/>comes to trying to work out if I am using AP or the<br/>internal &quot;tuning fork&quot; to identify a note, not sure how one<br/>could ever be certain about it.</p><p>Anyway back to the quiz, it seems to me that one thing<br/>that&apos;s very confusing if you tend to hear notes in terms<br/>of component pitches is that if you hear a G, actually<br/>it is a whole blend of different pitches - even on a pure<br/>sounding instrument like flute or recorder, the note is<br/>coloured quite a bit by the inharmonic pitches in the<br/>attack (otherwise it would sound like a sine wave)<br/>- which confuses the issue, since you are trying to<br/>remember a cluster of pitches rather than an individual<br/>pitch.</p><p>So it sounds as though it may help - as an adult anyway - to use<br/>shephard tones made up of pure sine waves<br/>in octaves, to give fewer pitches to remember.</p><p>Also the octaves make sense to me as a simplifying<br/>concept since octave equivalence is something that<br/>for me isn&apos;t very strong. I can hear it but the same<br/>note in different octaves is notable more for the<br/>difference in the pitch sound than the similarity.</p><p>To hear octave equivalence, if playing it<br/>as exactly as I can to get really in tune, and for two<br/>notes played one after another (so not using beats),<br/>I tend to listen out for the first partial in the lower pitched<br/>sound and compare that in my mind with the higher pitched note.<br/>That&apos;s easier to hear than the octave equivalence of the<br/>fundamentals for me. Also I hear many more than<br/>twelve distinct pitch sounds to an octave. All that<br/>makes the task of identifying pitches by name much<br/>harder as you have maybe a hundred or so &quot;pitch colours&quot;<br/>per octave, and several octaves.</p><p>I wonder if that may be what it sounds like to a child?<br/>If so then it may help a lot to have a fixed pitch instrument<br/>if you want to learn the 12-t note names.</p><p>It would be interesting to know - do most people<br/>who are able to sing very exactly in pitch, or if using<br/>a sine wave generator to generate a pitch,<br/>when asked to sing a note an octave higher for<br/>an instrument with inharmonic partials like<br/>the piano - do they sing in pitch with the<br/>inharmonic partial, or do they sing an octave<br/>above the true fundamental of the note?</p><p>As a child my interests focused on maths and science<br/>much more than music, so at the moment maybe it<br/>is a bit like a child learning to identify pitches.<br/>Maybe lots of adults are in the same position - if so<br/>then trying to test their AP abilities by asking them to<br/>identify notes - or even to sing the same pitch on<br/>successive days - may be not enough to pick up on it<br/>as the mental pitch scene is just too complex for them<br/>and maybe even if they hear sounds in terms of<br/>component pitches, they have given up trying to give names for<br/>anything at all. So some adults may need training for some time<br/>before they can begin to answer the questions.<br/>At any rate I&apos;m sure that right now if tested for<br/>AP I&apos;d come out as one of those who don&apos;t have it.<br/>But (whether using the tuning fork in my ear or<br/>through true AP is hard to know) it seems that I<br/>could if I were to work on it, to come to the point<br/>where I could reproduce any pitch I like, and from<br/>that come to be able to identify notes by name.<br/>Whether it would ever be &quot;instantly&quot; like true AP<br/>is hard to tell. But in principle it seems possible that<br/>it could become quite fast anyway if I were to really<br/>work on the mental play - as a biproduct, because<br/>it seems that the mental play is naturally in pitch<br/>- that you don&apos;t play it back at a different pitch from<br/>the one you heard it in.</p><p>But I wonder - is that true for others - when you play a<br/>tune back in your mind, if you do it before you play the<br/>sound for real - if you have a strong sense of relative<br/>pitch - what happens? Is the tune you hear in your<br/>mind the same pitch as what follows - or does it<br/>drift in pitch so some days it is lower or higher in pitch?<br/>Or does it have an indeterminate pitch? How does it<br/>compare with the short term memory you have of<br/>a melodic phrase immediately after you play<br/>a note - is it the same type of thing or is there<br/>a difference in character?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=72546 href="#72546">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

It&apos;s a lot like the<br/>&gt;  difference between trying to perceive green by seeing a green object<br/>&gt;  vs. walking into a room filled with green objects.</p><p>Oh well that&apos;s very easy - in FTS I  have &quot;custom voices&quot; which consist<br/>of several midi instruments played simultaneously - so the player<br/>plays a single note on the keyboard say, and they hear as many<br/>instruments as they like playing  that note simultaneously.<br/>It can be the same instrument  or different instruments, and<br/>various other options - the option of interest here is that they<br/>can play at fixed intervals from the note the player played.</p><p>My idea would be just to have a quiz where the program plays<br/>a note doubled in octaves (or several octaves), and asks the<br/>user to guess which note it is - and of course let them use any<br/>tuning for the underlying scale to pick the note from.<br/>Once I add in the  Sagittal note names after the release it<br/>would be able to show the note  name in Sagittal too.</p><p>Probably would be something you usually would do later on<br/>once you have gone through the mental play stage and can already<br/>play tunes in the desired tuning in your mind, and  just want<br/>to firm up your grasp of the note names for the tuning.<br/>Anyway would be fun to try it out and see if it works and<br/>whether the octave doubling  helps.</p><p>At the moment I&apos;m doing mostly debugging, in the lead<br/>up to the release,  but do just a little bit of extra coding<br/>from time to time, like a day or so per week  say, and since<br/>this is a  small change in the already programmed<br/>quiz, I may well do it before the release. I thought I might make<br/>it into a separaete task for 3.0 anyway to make it easier to find it<br/>and use it.</p><p>Anyway if I do get the time to program it then we can discuss<br/>it off-list or in a separate group as you suggest.</p><p>To explain the bit about octave differences, from my own experience,<br/>I&apos;ve  not made a big distinction yet between pitch height and<br/>pitch colour in an octave - and of course as you suggest,<br/>if the aim is to develop conventional  AP then  one  should make<br/>that distinction and aim to perceive pitches using<br/>octave reduced pitch  classes,</p><p>However, from my own experience, I wonder if the normal octave<br/>doubling type pitch colour of AP may be one<br/>of several options. E.g. I wonder, if one doubled at 3/1, might one<br/>be able to learn to perceive a different set of AP like pitch<br/>classes, for the Bohlen Pierce scale? I wonder what<br/>happens if one is a long term member of a particular<br/>gamelan ensemble playing a particular instrument,<br/>whether one might develop non octave pitch colours.</p><p>Also - I&apos;m not sure whether I want to develop AP myself actually<br/>as my weakness is in relative pitch distinctions and if one had<br/>to choose one or the other, though both are useful, of the two,<br/>perception of relative pitch for intervals seems a more useful<br/>ability to have.</p><p>But developing stronger mental play seems a good thing too,<br/>and it seems in my case anyway that a form of AP would<br/>result from developing that. I imagine developing both<br/>at once may be optimal.</p><p>With  AP - I wonder if one can combine it with<br/>a relative pitch type system as well?</p><p>You&apos;d imagine that might be ideal - to have the absolute pitch<br/>perception, and a secondary note name system<br/>that you can slide up / down to any root you like.<br/>Another thing I sometimes do is to practice playing the<br/>same tune in all the keys or at least in as wide a variety<br/>of keys as I can easily manage. Or just a phrase,<br/>play a phrase in all the twelve keys - if in 31-et I suppose<br/>one  would do all the 31 keys too - go round the circle<br/>of fifths. The idea there is to strengthen my perception of<br/>relative pitch.</p><p>The one bane of AP is when you hear someone and they<br/>sound out of tune in the sense that every single note they<br/>play - even a single note - sounds out of tune, e.g.<br/>every single note they play is a tiny bit flat. That&apos;s<br/>happened to me once or twice, while listening to<br/>early music, doesn&apos;t happen any more, but<br/>something like ten years ago I remember it<br/>happening from time to time, when I had a &apos;cello<br/>and practiced it a lot - and it was a nuisance<br/>because you couldn&apos;t enjoy music sometimes<br/>because though in-tune in relative pitch<br/>terms, it sounded out  of tune in this sense.</p><p>I imagine  that  the solution to that is just to make sure<br/>you develop a sufficiently good sense of  relative<br/>pitch at the  same time as you develop AP<br/>- I&apos;d be interested to know what  your experiences<br/>have been in this area yourself.</p><p>The pitch in my ear is not a nuisance at all<br/>- normally I only notice it when  there is no music playing<br/>- it is very high pitched and extremely quiet, most would<br/>probably describe it as more like a quiet hiss han a musical note<br/>- actually several pitches, but one prominent one.<br/>I&apos;m used to ignoring it - perhaps its one of those things where<br/>the mind is able to edit  it out because it doesn&apos;t change.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think children will likely be hearing partials distinct from<br/>the fundamental. When I was young I didn&apos;t hear the accordion basses<br/>as multiple pitches in octaves or a melody played in octaves on the<br/>piano as separate pitches. It was only when I was older that I heard<br/>the sounds as separate tones in octaves.</p><p>&gt;  If you&apos;re being distracted by partials that aren&apos;t merging together<br/>into a single perceived pitch, then you need to use a different<br/>timbre.</p><p>Okay that&apos; makes sense, sounds as if for most listeners<br/>there won&apos;t be that much advantage in using sine waves<br/>for the instrument. Though I wonder if it may explain<br/>why players of an instrument may find  it easier<br/>to learn to identify pitches on their own instrument<br/>to start with.</p><p>Even if they hear it as a merged single pitch, it may<br/>be that the &quot;colour&quot; they perceive for that pitch is<br/>affected by the other constituent partials that make<br/>up the instrument timbre, even though they merge<br/>them together.</p><p>I tend to hear most instruments with some element<br/>of unmerged partials. E.g. on recorder, I hear<br/>the 2/1 and a very faint  3/1 on most notes.<br/>But that&apos;s probably very listener dependent.<br/>It&apos;s probably because I do a lot of listening to<br/>component pitches of notes. I can ignore<br/>them, and let the partials merge into a single<br/>note - but with just about any instrument<br/>I can hear the partials if I pay attention to them,<br/>especially in a long sustained note.</p><p>BTW by &quot;colour&quot; here I don&apos;t necessarily<br/>mean like a visual colour, as I gather it is listener<br/>dependent. I wonder if AP always leads to some element<br/>of synaesthesia or if you can have AP with no<br/>cross over to other senses at all? One  would sort<br/>of expect if one had never heard of it before, that<br/>you could just hear a pitch in the same way as you<br/>see a colour, without any element of  any other sense<br/>involved. I&apos;m not sure what it is in my case<br/>- maybe a colour, but it isn&apos;t developed enough<br/>to know quite what it is.</p><p>Some of the speculations and questions are meant here to be<br/>open ended, so if some of them are interesting maybe<br/>they may start up other discussions.</p><p>BTW I&apos;ve been taking a few days off from coding.<br/>Back to coding again tomorrow, so if I don&apos;t join<br/>in the debate much more, it&apos;s probably just that<br/>I&apos;m pre-occupied with bug fixing or something.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=72553 href="#72553">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

Tones having the same pitch color must have their<br/>frequencies in a ratio that can be expressed as a power of 2 (an<br/>octave or multiple octaves) or something within a few cents of that<br/>(i.e., tempered octaves).  I don&apos;t subscribe to the idea that<br/>anything significantly different than an octave (or multiple<br/>thereof), such as 1:3 or 1/2-octave can be an &quot;interval of<br/>equivalence&quot;, because our brains aren&apos;t wired to hear the same pitch-<br/>color for tones separated by those intervals.  (I recall that Paul<br/>Erlich said something to the same effect.  Also, Monz, in msg.<br/>#68709, refers to the &quot;affect&quot; of prime number 2 as &quot;similitude&quot;.)<br/>If we&apos;re describing tonal systems with multiple chains of generators<br/>separated by an interval other than an octave (such as pajara or<br/>ennealimmal), then we should use the term &quot;period&quot; for that purpose.<br/>(Hmm, I&apos;m wondering how many angry cards and letters I&apos;m going to get<br/>for saying that.)</p><p>&gt; I wonder what<br/>&gt; happens if one is a long term member of a particular<br/>&gt; gamelan ensemble playing a particular instrument,<br/>&gt; whether one might develop non octave pitch colours.</p><p>With non-harmonic timbres one might hear octaves &quot;tempered&quot; by 10 or<br/>20 cents as having the same pitch-color, but if it&apos;s more than a<br/>comma or so, it&apos;ll probably be too much of a stretch.</p><p>&gt; Also - I&apos;m not sure whether I want to develop AP myself actually<br/>&gt; as my weakness is in relative pitch distinctions and if one had<br/>&gt; to choose one or the other, though both are useful, of the two,<br/>&gt; perception of relative pitch for intervals seems a more useful<br/>&gt; ability to have.</p><p>Yes, I agree.</p><p>&gt; But developing stronger mental play seems a good thing too,<br/>&gt; and it seems in my case anyway that a form of AP would<br/>&gt; result from developing that. I imagine developing both<br/>&gt; at once may be optimal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With AP - I wonder if one can combine it with<br/>&gt; a relative pitch type system as well?</p><p>If by &quot;relative pitch type system&quot; you mean the ability to perceive<br/>and think using AP and RP simultaneously, then I&apos;d have to say yes,<br/>because I do that myself.  In fact, I can more readily identify<br/>*intervals* in 31-ET than the specific pitches involved, because the<br/>psychololgical differences are so obvious.  If you can tell the<br/>difference between a major, minor, and neutral 3rd (or 6th, or 2nd,<br/>or 7th), then you&apos;ll understand what I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;d imagine that might be ideal - to have the absolute pitch<br/>&gt; perception, and a secondary note name system<br/>&gt; that you can slide up / down to any root you like.<br/>&gt; Another thing I sometimes do is to practice playing the<br/>&gt; same tune in all the keys or at least in as wide a variety<br/>&gt; of keys as I can easily manage. Or just a phrase,<br/>&gt; play a phrase in all the twelve keys - if in 31-et I suppose<br/>&gt; one would do all the 31 keys too - go round the circle<br/>&gt; of fifths. The idea there is to strengthen my perception of<br/>&gt; relative pitch.</p><p>With a generalized keyboard you would hardly have to think about<br/>which keys to press: just play by interval-vectors and listen.</p><p>&gt; The one bane of AP is when you hear someone and they<br/>&gt; sound out of tune in the sense that every single note they<br/>&gt; play - even a single note - sounds out of tune, e.g.<br/>&gt; every single note they play is a tiny bit flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s<br/>&gt; happened to me once or twice, while listening to<br/>&gt; early music, doesn&apos;t happen any more, but<br/>&gt; something like ten years ago I remember it<br/>&gt; happening from time to time, when I had a &apos;cello<br/>&gt; and practiced it a lot - and it was a nuisance<br/>&gt; because you couldn&apos;t enjoy music sometimes<br/>&gt; because though in-tune in relative pitch<br/>&gt; terms, it sounded out of tune in this sense.</p><p>I&apos;ve never heard things in different pitch standards that way.  I got<br/>an advertisement for an AP training course way back in the 1980&apos;s,<br/>and the author (it might have been David Burge, but I&apos;m not sure)<br/>said something to the effect that off-pitch music, with the intervals<br/>of the proper sizes, didn&apos;t really sound out of tune to him either,<br/>just color-shifted.  Sometimes on a classical radio station I&apos;ll hear<br/>early music played at lower-than-A440 pitch (possibly in something<br/>close to meantone temperament), which reminds me of the general<br/>effect of the pitch-colors I&apos;ve heard on my Scalatron in 31-ET in the<br/>flat keys (which might be described as a color-shift).</p><p>&gt; I imagine that the solution to that is just to make sure<br/>&gt; you develop a sufficiently good sense of relative<br/>&gt; pitch at the same time as you develop AP<br/>&gt; - I&apos;d be interested to know what your experiences<br/>&gt; have been in this area yourself.</p><p>If you don&apos;t already have AP, then I don&apos;t know whether you can work<br/>on AP at the same time as RP, because developing AP involves<br/>listening for pitch-colors (which are irrelevant to RP).  But if you<br/>already have both AP and RP for 12-ET, then I think that microtonal<br/>AP and RP would naturally be developed simultaneously (although I&apos;d<br/>say that microtonal RP comes more easily).</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; BTW by &quot;colour&quot; here I don&apos;t necessarily<br/>&gt; mean like a visual colour, as I gather it is listener<br/>&gt; dependent. I wonder if AP always leads to some element<br/>&gt; of synaesthesia or if you can have AP with no<br/>&gt; cross over to other senses at all? One would sort<br/>&gt; of expect if one had never heard of it before, that<br/>&gt; you could just hear a pitch in the same way as you<br/>&gt; see a colour, without any element of any other sense<br/>&gt; involved. I&apos;m not sure what it is in my case<br/>&gt; - maybe a colour, but it isn&apos;t developed enough<br/>&gt; to know quite what it is.</p><p>I&apos;d say that crossover between aural and visual color perception is<br/>largely, if not completely, subjective, a matter of chance<br/>association.  The only possible objective association between them I<br/>can think of is that the frequency of middle C multipled by 2^41 (41<br/>octaves up) corresponds to a light frequency that we perceive as<br/>green, but I don&apos;t hear &quot;C&quot; as &quot;green&quot; (or any other visual color,<br/>for that matter).  The only sound/color association I can recall is<br/>that the 2nd B-flat below middle C on the piano at one time reminded<br/>me of &quot;brown&quot;, which, coincidentally, has a chroma value (orange-<br/>like) that corresponds rather closely to a forty-something octave<br/>downward transposition of the frequency of orange light (which works<br/>best, BTW, with a pitch standard of C=256 hz.)</p><p>&gt; Some of the speculations and questions are meant here to be<br/>&gt; open ended, so if some of them are interesting maybe<br/>&gt; they may start up other discussions.</p><p>Some of these things tend to get OT, however.  :-(</p><p>&gt; BTW I&apos;ve been taking a few days off from coding.<br/>&gt; Back to coding again tomorrow, so if I don&apos;t join<br/>&gt; in the debate much more, it&apos;s probably just that<br/>&gt; I&apos;m pre-occupied with bug fixing or something.</p><p>I didn&apos;t know we were having a debate (but I don&apos;t care to debate<br/>that).</p><p>Anyway, if your bugs are broken, you&apos;d better get them fixed or<br/>something.  ;-)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=72556 href="#72556">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2007 6:18:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George D.

(Besides the fact that two colors together just looks like a different color). You can transpose music to a different key and it still sounds more or less the same (unless it goes into a different register of the instrument). Small changes in hue might go unnoticed, but if you shift the hue of a picture significantly, it looks unnatural. Red is fundamentally a different color from green, as yellow is different from blue. The kind of relation between tones that allows for transposition doesn&apos;t have any equivalent with color. Does the interval from red to yellow look like the interval from green to blue? Is it smaller or larger? There&apos;s not really a perception of exact interval size with colors.</p><p>Still, it&apos;s hard to think of a better equivalent. Compass directions? But even then, &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; have a special position on the scale. It&apos;s only arbitrary that A=440 is a standard reference pitch (marching bands, for instance, tune to Bb).</p></div><h3><a id=72557 href="#72557">ðŸ”—</a>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2007 1:41:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>&gt;  If you don&apos;t already have AP, then I don&apos;t know whether you can work<br/>on AP at the same time as RP, because developing AP involves<br/>listening for pitch-colors (which are irrelevant to RP). But if you<br/>already have both AP and RP for 12-ET, then I think that microtonal<br/>AP and RP would naturally be developed simultaneously (although I&apos;d<br/>say that microtonal RP comes more easily).</p><p>Since both would be a long term process, my plan would be to work a<br/>bit on one then a bit on the other - and have some pieces that I always<br/>play in the same key for now, to practice mental play and  AP, and<br/>at the same time while practicing, to play intervals around the  circle<br/>of fifths etc in order to strengthen relative pitch.</p><p>BTW I&apos;m trying playing back my Teleman pieces using recorders<br/>in parallel in four octaves, and I think it helps.</p><p>I&apos;m glad to hear that AP needn&apos;t mean that one hears music that&apos;s<br/>out of tune as &quot;flat&quot;. I think what happened there is probably that<br/>I hadn&apos;t got strong enough relative pitch at the time. That also<br/>would be a good reason to develop both together as much as<br/>one can. Maybe that&apos;s not a problem if one already has a strong<br/>sense of relative pitch.</p><p>Yes, I hear differences in the different types of chords - but the way<br/>in which my relative pitch is weak is that I don&apos;t hear the differences<br/>at all easily if it is just an isolated interval. But add a couple of<br/>extra notes and it becomes obvious.</p><p>When it is a single isolated diad suddenly out of context<br/>then - well of course I could sing the notes and work out<br/>the interval - or could listen to the partials if the notes<br/>are long sustained notes.</p><p>But - if played fairly quickly in an arbitrary key and at any pitch transposition,<br/>and with the notes played one after another with no overlap,<br/>my relative pitch gets completely confused - to the<br/>extent that I can even get confused between a 9/8<br/>and a 3/2. I clearly have relative pitch discrimination<br/>but it only seems to key in strongly with longer phrases<br/>of maybe five or six notes. It is something I can<br/>train in.</p><p>While on the other hand notes that follow each other that<br/>differ by a small fraction of a semitone, even with quite a long time<br/>gap between them, are easy to distinguish.<br/>So that&apos;s the sense in which my pitch discrimination<br/>seems to be much finer in an AP rather than a<br/>RP sense, even though I don&apos;t have AP as ordinarily<br/>understood.</p><p>On the 3/1 equivalence - well I&apos;m just not sure,<br/>as someone not trained from an early age, the<br/>2/1 octave similarity doesn&apos;t seem to me to be<br/>quite so pre-eminent as all that. It&apos;s clearly stronger<br/>than the 3/1 similarity - but not by so much that<br/>it seems to me to be the only possible way<br/>to make equivalence classes of the pitch<br/>&quot;colours&quot;.</p><p>Yes FTS is all set up to read individual Scala scales, also you can<br/>make a droplist of all the scales in the Scala archive<br/>(or indeed all your scales in any folder).</p><p>Yes - will certainly let one select a subset of the current scale.</p><p>With the Teleman piece - with the first four notes I have<br/>C, G and A. So one might think that a good starting point might<br/>be to have a quiz on just those notes. So similarly<br/>while developing AP then</p><p>I had a look at an on-line page about AP by Diana Deutch<br/>and she wondered if her development of AP may have been<br/>helped by a coloured Xylophone she had as a child.<br/>I wonder if colour synaesthesia may be developed in that<br/>sort of a semi-accidental fashion when very young.</p><p>Yes there seem to be many schemes for colour associations<br/>around, - I have several options in FTS which users can<br/>use to colour the note names. A green note could be<br/>anything.</p><p>Yes it&apos;s an ineresting aspect of colour that you can&apos;t<br/>break up an individual colour into its constituent<br/>frequencies in the way you can with sound, e.g.<br/>WHEN MIXING LIGHTS monochromatic yellow<br/>light looks the same to us as a mixture of equal<br/>parts of red and green light, in fact computer<br/>screens use a mixture of red and green<br/>for yellow, and no-one can tell the difference<br/>except that mixed red / green light can never<br/>make quite such a saturated colour<br/>as monochromatic yellow light, always is seen<br/>as having a tiny admixture of white light.</p><p>But musicians with AP with synaesthesia for colour<br/>seem to be able to hear the component &quot;colours&quot; of a chord of<br/>many notes. I wonder how it is done? One idea is maybe<br/>they might have a separate spatial &quot;pitch height&quot;<br/>- or keyboard layout - and so see the colours<br/>separated in position as well as colour.</p><p>Associating the pitch with position in space does<br/>preserve the relative interval sizes. So a combination<br/>of colour + position would work in that respect,<br/>the colour just as a cue to the pitch like a colour coded<br/>xylophone.</p><p>Yes intriguing, never thought of that, &quot;bug fixing&quot;<br/>Actually I do sometimes fix a bug in the sense<br/>that the program does something unexpected<br/>which I find is actually useful, so fix it and make the<br/>bug into a feature.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=72559 href="#72559">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2007 8:06:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; On the 3/1 equivalence - well I&apos;m just not sure,<br/>&gt; as someone not trained from an early age, the<br/>&gt; 2/1 octave similarity doesn&apos;t seem to me to be<br/>&gt; quite so pre-eminent as all that.

The way I perceive things, the 3/1 similarity is of an entirely different kind from the 2/1 similarity. Notes a 3/1 interval apart share many of the same partials, if they are harmonic sounds, so if the 3rd harmonic is prominent in the lower note, it&apos;s possible that some general similarity may be perceived. But the difference between notes an octave apart is almost more a difference of timbre than pitch. Except in the extreme ranges (where pitch sensation starts getting &quot;muddy&quot; in the lower octaves and vague or indistinct in the higher octaves), an A sounds like an A, a C# sounds like a C#, and the notes don&apos;t even need to share partials to sound similar in that way. I&apos;ve just always assumed that everyone perceived sounds this way (even if they couldn&apos;t identify a pitch by name).</p></div><h3><a id=72562 href="#72562">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2007 12:46:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The way I perceive things, the 3/1 similarity is of an entirely<br/>&gt; different kind from the 2/1 similarity.</p><p>Same here, and the 4/1 similarity is of the same kind as the 2/1<br/>similarity.</p></div>
