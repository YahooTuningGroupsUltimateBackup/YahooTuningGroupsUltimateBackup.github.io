Pehrson:<br/>&gt; well, it does sound great.  Of course,<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s related to various orientalisms.  My favorite part of it is the<br/>&gt; &gt; fact that the TRITONE is the OCTAVE!  That&apos;s just great in my<br/>&gt; book...<br/>&gt; &gt; turning the &quot;resolving&quot; interval into the ultimate consonant diad!<br/>&gt; &gt; Whoopee!<br/>&gt;<br/>P. Erlich:<br/>&gt; Well, that would be true for any 6-note scale when played on a<br/>&gt; standard keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>Well, so much the better! That means that most ANY 6-note scales are<br/>going to have a similar effect!  You mention yourself in your excellent<br/>article on 22 tone scales -- which I had gone through before, and just<br/>went through again... I think it will take several more times before I<br/>digest all of it (was this &quot;indigestibility??&quot;... I think not) -- the<br/>significance of the tritone as the defining dissonance of diatonic<br/>music. In fact you point out, something I had never thought about, that<br/>the major and minor modes were the only modes that did not contain one<br/>of the elements of the tritone in the basic modal triads.  I had never<br/>thought about this before.</p><p>So this all goes to show, as you so clearly lay out, the significane of<br/>the diminished fifth, in terms of its high level of dissonance (isn&apos;t it<br/>the highest after the minor second?? -- dunno) and also its defining<br/>significance in terms of creating Western diatonic music through the<br/>major and minor modes.</p><p>Therefore, when the tritone suddenly becomes an octave, it is a<br/>startling effect, in a practical sense.  At least this was the effect it<br/>had on me!</p><p>_________ _____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
