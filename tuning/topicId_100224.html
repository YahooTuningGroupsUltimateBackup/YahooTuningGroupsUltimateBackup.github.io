I&apos;ll summarize that<br/>understanding:<br/>Igs is writing an introductory survey of EDOs for beginners,<br/>with some emphasis on guitar (his main instrument).  He was<br/>looking for a way to describe the sound and potential musical<br/>function of intervals in these EDOs to near novices.<br/>Recently, he announced he would scrap his previous approach<br/>based on approximations to just intonation and instead<br/>identify each EDO interval the nearest rational found in the<br/>harmonic series, up to the 64th harmonic.  He also announced<br/>an 8-cent approximation threshold, though it isn&apos;t clear how<br/>he planned to use it.</p><p>I&apos;ll define numerology as the unjustified use of numbers.<br/>It may be as innocuous as showing precision you don&apos;t have,<br/>or as strange as attributing magical powers to the numbers<br/>themselves (e.g. speaking certain numbers to cure diseases).<br/>It&apos;s a widespread and robust phenomenon, as are many forms<br/>of magical thinking in human history, and especially common<br/>in &quot;just intonation&quot; music theory (e.g. La Monte Young,<br/>Barbara Hero, etc).</p><p>I think it&apos;s pretty obvious that numerology is the only<br/>plausible rationale for the choice of harmonics up to 64 in<br/>Igs&apos; proposal.  Mike said people could certainly learn to<br/>distinguish these intervals, and that I routinely deny the<br/>role of learning in music perception.  In fact I&apos;m one of<br/>the most outspoken proponents of learning in the microtonal<br/>community and have been for over a decade.  (This is true<br/>both in scale theory, where I&apos;m one of the most vocal<br/>proponents of using categorical perception to classify<br/>scales, and in psychoacoustics, where I&apos;m among the first<br/>to mention plasticity in combination-sensitive neurons as<br/>potentially important in the perception of harmony.)</p><p>As I&apos;ve written here many times, it&apos;s the nature of<br/>learning that nothing is impossible to learn.  Here&apos;s one<br/>example: <a href="/tuning/topicId_94046.html#94179">/tuning/topicId_94046.html#94179</a><br/>But there is still the question of what is practical to<br/>learn, what is learned already by most of the public and<br/>what is known only to specialists, etc.  (Generally it&apos;s<br/>assumed that any effect that can be heard by the audience<br/>can be used musically.)</p><p>64/63 and 63/62 are less than half a cent apart.  This is<br/>beyond the resolution of any ordinary guitar and beyond<br/>the limits of human perception thus far measured in<br/>laboratories.  It&apos;s also noticeably smaller than 8 cents.</p><p>Assuming this obstacle could be overcome, distinguishing<br/>the &quot;texture&quot; of so many intervals is not a skill in the<br/>general population, nor one ever documented.  Igs said<br/>it&apos;s a skill possessed by Dante Rosati and others.  I<br/>replied that there&apos;s no evidence of this and there bloody<br/>well is none.</p><p>Even assuming Igs were not writing a general-purpose primer<br/>for novices and their audiences, but instead a primer for<br/>people willing to learn this exotic skill, there&apos;s still<br/>the ugly coincidence that the standard chosen just happens<br/>to involve those favorite playthings of the microtonal<br/>numerologists: rational numbers.  Why not any other<br/>standard?  And why the 8-cent approximation threshold?</p><p>It&apos;s also the nature of learning that older brains learn<br/>less permanently and less easily than younger ones.  The<br/>recognition of the texture of the rationals up to Tenney<br/>height 100 (on average) and SPAN 2-3 octaves is something<br/>all healthy natural language speakers learn in the womb and<br/>the first months of life.  Expecting adult audiences to make<br/>major changes in this foundation is completely unrealistic.<br/>For comparison, it&apos;s possible to learn absolute pitch skills<br/>in adulthood.  This has been shown in university studies.<br/>But the skills are never as robust as those who acquire them<br/>at a young age, and outside of a paid study it&apos;s not clear<br/>how many people have ever bothered and met with success.</p><p>In short, from what I know of reality and what I know of<br/>Igs&apos; long work on his primer, his recent proposal was not<br/>a good one.  And his subsequent defense of it on grounds<br/>of cultural-relativistic B.S. didn&apos;t help.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt;&gt; ...analyzes each EDO in terms of harmonics 32-64 and<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;bans&quot; any approximations worse than 8 cents off.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A lot of stuff up there simply isn&apos;t audible outside<br/>&gt; of very specific listening conditions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Abstract models (such as analyzing an equal temperament<br/>&gt; in terms of a harmonic series) should aid us in reaching<br/>&gt; consistent conclusions about reality. Using harmonics<br/>&gt; 32-64 with a brick wall 8-cent error cutoff won&apos;t do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I disagree. The &quot;reality&quot; is that harmonics 32-64 each<br/>&gt;&gt; have a sound (or at least a texture) that people can<br/>&gt;&gt; and have learned to recognize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who?

It&apos;s also noticeably smaller than 8 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assuming this obstacle could be overcome, distinguishing<br/>&gt; the &quot;texture&quot; of so many intervals is not a skill in the<br/>&gt; general population, nor one ever documented. Igs said<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a skill possessed by Dante Rosati and others. I<br/>&gt; replied that there&apos;s no evidence of this and there bloody<br/>&gt; well is none.</p><p>As we know for certain at this point, we&apos;re talking about rooted<br/>harmonics from 32-64, not all 64-integer-limit dyads. So I&apos;ll respond<br/>to just the &quot;rooted&quot; claim.</p><p>1) You can distinguish between intervals that are the same size given<br/>the right musical context.<br/>2) If I play 300 cents to you after exposing you to 10 minutes of<br/>silence, and I ask you whether I just played an augmented second or a<br/>minor third, you will fail.<br/>3) Distinguishing the &quot;texture&quot; of all of the intervals in 12-tet is<br/>not a skill that the general population possesses. Plenty of people<br/>routinely screw up the difference between an octave and a perfect<br/>fifth. Nonetheless, most of the same people can still carry a melody,<br/>because musical context activates some part of musical cognition that<br/>bare dyads don&apos;t.<br/>5) This scale provides for some of the best contextual cues ever:<br/>there are low-complexity ratios every eighth note (4:5:6:7) - &quot;chord<br/>tones&quot;, and then halfway between those are intermediate complexity<br/>ratios (8:..:16) - &quot;diatonic non-chord tones,&quot; and then in between<br/>those you have higher complexity ones (16:..:32) - &quot;chromatic<br/>non-chord tones,&quot; and then in between those you would have ultra<br/>high-complexity notes that are kind of like &quot;quarter tones.&quot;<br/>6) I can already identify harmonics 16-32 and I&apos;m pretty sure that I<br/>can personally get 32-64 if I work at it. 33/32 is a quarter tone,<br/>34/32 is a half step, 35/32 is a neutral second, etc. It would get<br/>harder as you go up more and more, but I&apos;m not convinced that a short<br/>bout of training would stop anyone on the list from getting it.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if 43/32, which is a 511 cent 26-tet sized<br/>fourth, even acquired a secondary &quot;rooted&quot; sound (or perhaps<br/>&quot;function&quot;) after a while, given how it&apos;s going to sound if you play<br/>it as part of any decent-sized chord in this scale. Most large chords<br/>in this scale will evoke a single VF, and you can always just remember<br/>that sounds after and learn to hear 43/32 as a part of that.</p><p>&gt; Even assuming Igs were not writing a general-purpose primer<br/>&gt; for novices and their audiences, but instead a primer for<br/>&gt; people willing to learn this exotic skill, there&apos;s still<br/>&gt; the ugly coincidence that the standard chosen just happens<br/>&gt; to involve those favorite playthings of the microtonal<br/>&gt; numerologists: rational numbers. Why not any other<br/>&gt; standard? And why the 8-cent approximation threshold?</p><p>The 8-cent threshold was the only thing he said that I didn&apos;t agree with.</p><p>Nonetheless, the results are in: people like using rational numbers to<br/>discuss categorical perceptions these days, and prefer to see a VF as<br/>just one minor part of what can make up the sound of an interval.<br/>People like to claim that 81/64 and 5/4 are different, and if they&apos;ve<br/>learned to distinguish the two, then to that person they are different<br/>things, even if they share the similarity because they evoke the same<br/>VF. Things that are different need a name, and &quot;5/4&quot; and &quot;81/64&quot; are<br/>two decent names to use. There is a difference between making a<br/>specific claim about VF perception, and simply using numbers to<br/>distinguish between percepts without caring whether two intervals<br/>share a VF or not. The former is numerological, the latter is not. I<br/>haven&apos;t seen any artists make the former claim, but perhaps that was<br/>all the rage before I joined the list.</p><p>VF perception is not such an overwhelming gestalt that it is worth<br/>telling people that referring to 29/16 is numerological. It might be<br/>worth addressing that 29/16 might evoke the same VF as 7/4, but if<br/>someone has learned to distinguish 29/16 by its unique combination of<br/>VF, mistuning, tonalness, and beating, then they have every right to<br/>give that gestalt whatever name they want. I don&apos;t think that most<br/>people would be averse to us telling them that 14/11 and 5/4 are<br/>likely to evoke the same VF and that that fact is of prime importance<br/>for harmony, but I think they would in fact object to us saying they<br/>can&apos;t call an interval 14/11 at all because it&apos;s going to be heard<br/>&quot;as&quot; a 5/4.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s also the nature of learning that older brains learn<br/>&gt; less permanently and less easily than younger ones. The<br/>&gt; recognition of the texture of the rationals up to Tenney<br/>&gt; height 100 (on average) and SPAN 2-3 octaves is something<br/>&gt; all healthy natural language speakers learn in the womb and<br/>&gt; the first months of life. Expecting adult audiences to make<br/>&gt; major changes in this foundation is completely unrealistic.</p><p>Here&apos;s my experience: when I started playing 11/8 as a dyad, it<br/>sounded like either a flat tritone or sometimes, more rarely, a sharp<br/>fourth. After spending months in porcupine now, and using 11/8 in<br/>otonal chords, I&apos;ve started hearing it in isolation as having that<br/>characteristic and somewhat ominous sound of being a &quot;rooted, complex&quot;<br/>dyad that most importantly evokes the proper 11/8 VF. I&apos;ve even heard<br/>the same thing happening for 11/9 - play the first five notes of a<br/>porcupine[7] Lssssss scale (let&apos;s call those notes C D E F G), and<br/>while holding the C, play D-F -&gt; E-G -&gt; D-F -&gt; C-E -&gt; D-F, which<br/>should sound like you&apos;re arpeggiating 8:9:10:11:12. Then, if you let<br/>go of the C, you hear the D-F as still having a &quot;root&quot; of C, and it<br/>doesn&apos;t sound like a 6/5 at all (which it&apos;s closer to in porcupine),<br/>nor does it sound like a &quot;neutral third.&quot; It sounds like a &quot;tonal&quot;<br/>interval that has a root that&apos;s 9/8 below the bottom note. In short,<br/>it sounds like an 11/9.</p><p>Sometimes my perception gets &quot;stuck&quot; this way and I have trouble<br/>reframing it to be a minor third again. And if, in the above example,<br/>I stay on that D-F and suddenly modulate to D minor 9, thus taking<br/>advantage of the 55/54 unison vector, the other perception of it<br/>somehow colors the sound in a way that sounds really irritating and<br/>wrong. It&apos;s not that it starts sounding like a &quot;neutral&quot; third, but<br/>just that it sounds like cheese whiz. I don&apos;t know how to describe it<br/>any other way than that, and I get stuck in it and now I can&apos;t get out<br/>of this new &quot;wrong&quot; perception. Point is: I&apos;ve already seen radical<br/>changes in my perception of even bare dyads - it just took AXiS and<br/>SSquares and several dozen hours playing on an actual instrument to<br/>activate it.</p><p>Music theory is different from other forms of science: the burden of<br/>proof is on us to disprove something as being unrealistic beyond the<br/>shadow of a doubt before it can be claimed that it&apos;s unrealistic - and<br/>let&apos;s also consider who we&apos;re saying that it&apos;s unrealistic for.<br/>Artists tend to be extreme personalities who devote utterly<br/>exhorbitant amounts of their time to learning to do unrealistic things<br/>for no other reason than that they want to explore as many new forms<br/>of perception as possible before they die. That sounds heavy, but it&apos;s<br/>what it is. The claim that something is impractical means that it&apos;s<br/>possible if you practice enough. Things are possible by default until<br/>proven otherwise given the objective and work ethic of this audience.</p><p>As for whether the audience will be able to become hip to what&apos;s going<br/>on - the concept of a musical phenomenon being targeted to a specific<br/>audience with the same developed skill to decode the information is<br/>certainly not unheard of in music today. Take when drummers will start<br/>playing a fake backbeat in a different subdivision of the true tempo<br/>(like imagine that you&apos;re in 4/4, and you accent every third sixteenth<br/>note. Then start playing a drum beat over the new &quot;fake tempo&quot; while<br/>still keeping the original in your mind). The audience that can keep<br/>counting the 4 will get what&apos;s going on and continue to follow the<br/>form of the song, whereas the audience that can&apos;t will lose their<br/>place and have to get back on the train when the normal&nbsp;beat restarts.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100258 href="#100258">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2011 6:30:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; People like to claim that 81/64 and 5/4 are different, and if &gt;they&apos;ve<br/>&gt; learned to distinguish the two, then to that person they are &gt;different<br/>&gt; things, even if they share the similarity because they evoke the &gt;same<br/>&gt; VF.</p><p>I suspect that it is more likely that one must learn to conflate the two, by internalizing some kind of diatonic grid.

Four simple<br/>questions for you:</p><p>1) For these intervals, particularly for 43/32, do you hear them as<br/>being &quot;rooted&quot; intervals, where the root is the bottom note? Or for<br/>43/32, do you hear the root as being the top note? Or is it variable?<br/>2) Do you find that you require brighter, harsher timbres with more<br/>harmonics to really clearly be able to distinguish between intervals?<br/>Do you think you&apos;d have trouble if you used a triangle wave? For<br/>example, do you hear 43/32 as having a beating sound, and does that<br/>beating sound help you to identify the interval in any way?<br/>3) Can you identify all dyads between each harmonic, or just ones that<br/>have a root of /32? E.g. can you identify 63/37, for example?<br/>4) Do you ever find that 43/32 sounds ambiguous with 4/3?</p><p>Just curious; your insight here would be much appreciated.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100270 href="#100270">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2011 1:32:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Jun 21, 2011 at 9:30 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; People like to claim that 81/64 and 5/4 are different, and if &gt;they&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; learned to distinguish the two, then to that person they are &gt;different<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; things, even if they share the similarity because they evoke the &gt;same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; VF.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suspect that it is more likely that one must learn to conflate the two, by internalizing some kind of diatonic grid.

But they do not need to produce different virtual fundamental<br/>&gt; pitches to be perceived as having differences, and there&apos;s no need &gt;to<br/>&gt; pretend they do.</p><p>Keep in mind that there is a great deal of subjectivity to &quot;virtual fundamental&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 375 cents and 400 cents are also &quot;major thirds&quot; that beat, but they<br/>&gt; sound very different. There is something different in the quality of<br/>&gt; these two intervals, despite that they both beat. That something is<br/>&gt; what I&apos;m pointing out.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve been pointing that out for years here, in the face of jeering (for of course I&apos;m an ignorant fool for not acknowledgeing that these are simply mistunings of their Platonian identity, 5/4).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think that most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; people would be averse to us telling them that 14/11 and 5/4 are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; likely to evoke the same VF and that that fact is of prime importance<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for harmony, but I think they would in fact object to us saying they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; can&apos;t call an interval 14/11 at all because it&apos;s going to be heard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;as&quot; a 5/4.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hearing a bright, driving, beating interval as a soft smooth stable interval would be... well, unmusical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is noteworthy that we do hear it as bright, driving, and beating<br/>&gt; rather than being perfectly synchronous at the 14/11.</p><p>Yes: &quot;point of reference&quot; and &quot;identity&quot; are not the same thing. There&apos;s orienting beating around partials 4 and 5, it&apos;s dishonest to pretend otherwise, but that does not mean they somehow &quot;are&quot; 5/4 Quite the contrary, really. Early and often working with the strongly microtonal genera of enharmonic and soft chromatic, I&apos;ve found that the strong lower partials help to emphasize microtonal distinctions rather than subsume small intervals into a black hole of &quot;identity&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hearing both as a &quot;major third&quot; isn&apos;t unmusical, it simply tells us that a &quot;major third&quot; can fall within a goodly range of tuning, which is in keeping with the history of Western music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hearing both as evoking a virtual pitch two octaves below the lowest<br/>&gt; note isn&apos;t unmusical either, and this is another similarity that &gt;they<br/>&gt; will share outside of the &quot;major third&apos; category as well. A 9/7 &gt;might<br/>&gt; only share the &quot;major third&quot; status and not end up sharing the same<br/>&gt; VF.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One guy to whom I was introducing alternative tunings had no &gt;training other than singing in acappella choirs since childhood. He &gt;immediately said, upon hearing an 11/8, &quot;augmented &gt;fourth...perfectly in tune&quot;. Which I thought was quite interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve noticed sometimes that trumpet players in jazz bands will<br/>&gt; sometimes lip the #11 over a dom7#11 waaaay down, so that it gets<br/>&gt; closer to 11/8. Just saying.</p><p>I have spent some time trying to sing an isolated 7:5 cold, and haven&apos;t done it yet. I&apos;ll keep trying, but at this point it&apos;s always, without exception, 11/8, 16/11, or the 12-tET &quot;tritone&quot; (coupla cents plus or minus in each case). In context any interval is singable, if the structure has a sound-logic to it, there are reference pitches, etc. Just saying. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=100271 href="#100271">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2011 1:51:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Is your tuning derived from a section of the harmonic series fixed or relative?

This<br/>Eb is as exact in my mind&apos;s ear as any pitch could  be.

Time to see how plastic the brain can get. Four  simple<br/>questions for you:</p><p>1) For these intervals, particularly for  43/32, do you hear them as<br/>being &quot;rooted&quot; intervals, where the root is the  bottom note? Or for<br/>43/32, do you hear the root as being the top note? Or is  it variable?</p><p>The Stravinsky recording is in said tuning.  Only 43/32 perfect  fourths<br/>are played.  It is a happier interval than the just/pythagorean  perfect<br/>fourth.  It is 12 cents higher than the &quot;perfect fourth&quot; of  equal temperament.<br/>I fully believe in it when I play it.  It is  preferable in sound both<br/>melodically and harmonically to all the musicians  that have had a long time<br/>working with it...and they agree it sounds  &quot;better&quot; than 4/3 or ET&apos;s &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>fourth.  Not sure how I would  entertain &quot;roots&quot; here because it is a<br/>straight switch.</p><p>Mike:<br/>2) Do you find that you require brighter, harsher timbres with  more<br/>harmonics to really clearly be able to distinguish between  intervals?</p><p>J: just the opposite, actual overtones of the instrument make the<br/>instruments sound better.  That&apos;s why the violin family of instruments  tunes to<br/>pure fifths even when they are absent in equal temperament.</p><p>M: Do you think you&apos;d have trouble if you used a triangle wave?  For<br/>example, do you hear 43/32 as having a beating sound, and does  that<br/>beating sound help you to identify the interval in any way?</p><p>J: Can&apos;t speak to the triangle wave, being an acoustic musician.   However,<br/>beating is always to be eased out in the tuning.  We did  performances<br/>recently of Nicolo Vicentino in overtone tuning.  My honest  response is<br/>&quot;pungent&quot; and the audience found it very modern sounding, while  beautifully<br/>coherent.  Clearly no one heard it stick out as inferior in the  Stravinsky<br/>recording.  I played it a lot...standard D fingering with added  LH pinky on the<br/>Eb and Db keys, together.</p><p>3) Can you identify all dyads between each harmonic, or just ones  that<br/>have a root of /32? E.g. can you identify 63/37, for example?</p><p>J: 63/37 does not exist in the overtones.  However, temporary tonics  will<br/>give the ear even more to digest.  G major based on A overtones, has  an<br/>easily constructed major scale that sounds very 12/tet.

I treat it as &quot;just another note&quot;. and never have to stray far from the original procedure... which follows later in this post.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Let me give you some background as to my madness...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Many years ago, I tried to think like Pythagoras would have done, using addition and multiplication and basic algebra. With this in mind, &nbsp;I &quot;discoverd&quot;&nbsp; that he more than likely found an added factor scale that reveals itself in the sequence of theoretical frequencies from the NHS: &nbsp;80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160.&nbsp; Labeling the elements gives a scale A B C D E F G H then the octave A.&nbsp; &nbsp;All intervals are spaced by the same number &quot;10&quot;. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;Referring back to my post, Partch wrote (and paraphrasing) &quot;Timoteus, who used an 8 note scale&quot; (So tell me, what ever happened to H ? )<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;Next I wrote sound statements on my IBM PC Jr and played them back for my mom who was an accomplished singer. She had trouble distinguishing this 8 tone natural scale from the 12 TET&nbsp; diatonic 7&nbsp;tone major scale, mainly because the two scales have several intervals in common, with others in close proximity.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Most of what followed in my initial study, I wrote about in an unpublished work &quot;The Natural Routes Of Music&quot; copyrighted in 1981, then&nbsp; I moved on to concenterating on equal temperaments and published another book &quot; The Songwriters&apos; Guide to Scales and Chords&quot; copyrighted in 1982<br/>&nbsp;<br/>More recently, I went back and realized what a mistake it was to stop at 160 in the NHS. The added factor nature of deriving scale values continues into infinity. What was once just the &quot;added factor major&quot; scale to me, was more appropriately named the &quot;natural whole tone scale&quot;.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;Each succeeding octave then contains the natural microtuning of half tones quarter tones, etc... nested within the whole tone values that continue indefinitely. in the series. This is natural microtuning in a nut shell.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Note:This is easily applied using Scala but the software wants to &quot;correct you&quot; as you fight against the more commonly accepted proceedures of scale building that are incorporated into the program.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>There are more than a few short cuts that i use in my <a href="http://study.One">study.One</a> that I touched on briefly is the practice of identifying the parts of a ratio (n / m )&nbsp;as n = harmonic position, m&nbsp;= the number of notes in the octave. A good example is in the interval 9 / 8 where 9 is the harmonic position, 8&nbsp;is the number of notes in the octave ( at that point in the NHS)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Another short cut (for me)&nbsp;is abondoning the practice of viewing the NHS as 1/2, 2/3, 3/4... but instead just comparing the interval with the root position as the relative term 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... not the adjacent NHS position..&nbsp; Still another that should be no surprise to you,&nbsp;is using the octave factor to reduce any interval&nbsp; to a value between 1 and 2 and then applying the Ellis cent formula to give a&nbsp; letter value to the interval&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See... I&apos;m not claiming to have re invinted the wheel here.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>So I could go on and on, but I&apos;ll spare you that torture.&nbsp;Is all this groundbreaking development?<br/>It depends on whether you have studied microtuning for years&nbsp;and still don&apos;t quite get it ( not necessarily referring to you, of course)&nbsp;or if you want to see microtuning in a few simple steps that can be learned in real time as you look at it, ie, in 5 minutes or less.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Feel free to pick my brain or chastise me where appropriate.

I was shocked to find that I could still hear most of the<br/>piece in 5-equal, as though the 5 equal diatonic scale were literally<br/>1 1 0 1 1 1 0. It was quite an interesting experience, and says a lot<br/>about categorical perception. The 5-equal version had a few<br/>&quot;distortions&quot; of perception, but the fact that it was more or less<br/>intelligible at all was beyond ridiculous to me. What do you make of<br/>it?</p><p>My current modus operandi is that primary exposure to a psychoacoustic<br/>stimulus (a 5/4, for example) can &quot;burn&quot; an imprint of the experience<br/>into your mind for you to reify in later. So you quickly learn that<br/>the diatonic major third has this ~5/4-ish property, and then all<br/>diatonic major thirds remind you of that, and you fill in the gaps<br/>later. The VF mechanism doesn&apos;t actually have to fire for 5-equal so<br/>that you hear 480 cents as 5/4; it only has to be determined by a<br/>different cognitive function that 480 cents is a type of &quot;major third&quot;<br/>in context xyz, and your brain remembers that major thirds are<br/>consonant and rooted and just fills that information in via<br/>reification. What are your thoughts? There has to be some reason why<br/>these intervals sound different from one another, and this is one<br/>possibility.</p><p>&gt; My original point, an absolutely mainstream one, was that we need to take the dichotomy of harmonic/subharmonic, over/undertone, and musical claims based upon it, with a great honkin&apos; chunk of salt.</p><p>I&apos;ve never said otherwise. I think I hijacked this thread.</p><p>Although I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever hidden my disdain for the notion of<br/>&quot;utonality,&quot; as a side note I have noticed an interesting pattern<br/>lately - if you&apos;re in C major, and you go Fmaj -&gt; Cmaj, it&apos;s relaxing.<br/>And if you go Abmaj -&gt; Cmaj it&apos;s relaxing, and is kind of like a<br/>5-limit plagal cadence. And if you do the 7-limit version, which is<br/>like D7-&gt;C but with the D7 tuned 4:5:6:7 (keeping the C held constant,<br/>so the D is 8/7), it&apos;s relaxing. And the 11-limit version is also<br/>relaxing. And if you combine them you get things like Fm6 -&gt; Cmaj,<br/>which is also very relaxing and almost mystical. Try C-E-G-A# -&gt;<br/>E-G#-Cx-F#-A# -&gt; A#-Cx-E#-A# in 19-equal, which should be something<br/>like 4:5:6:7 -&gt; 4:5:7:9:11 -&gt; 4:5:6:8. It sounds like a higher-limit<br/>version of a plagal cadence to me. So there&apos;s something to be said for<br/>keeping the root constant and building nice harmonic chords underneath<br/>it, and that&apos;s all I can say for now.</p><p>&gt; Absolutely.

And we each know different<br/>&gt; things.  Let us share with some  flexibility (listening to Mahler in the<br/>&gt; background).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg says minor is not natural due to its  prehistory:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The minor mode is thus purely synthetic, a  product of art, and attempts<br/>&gt; to represent it as something given in nature are  pointless; its naturalness<br/>&gt; is not direct, but, like that of the  church modes, indirect.  Now it is<br/>&gt; true that major and minor  have evolved historically, that they represent an<br/>&gt; essential  simplification over what came before (for they are a sum,<br/>&gt; containing everything  that appeared in the seven old modes); and it is gtrue that<br/>&gt; the dualism  presented by major and minor has the power of a symbol suggesting<br/>&gt; high  forms of order: it reminds us of male and female and delimits the<br/>&gt; spheres  of expression according to attraction and repulsion.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg, Theory of Harmony (1911), p.  95-96.</p><p>Here you can see that Schoenberg either hadn&apos;t the foggiest about the church modes. The church modes were, until the beginning of the last century at least (I have a Roman Catholic instructional book for Gregorian Chant dated 1906), more essentially similar to what we&apos;d call &quot;maqam music&quot; than to anything subsumable by major/minor. The 1948 recording I had of monks in some abbey bore this out. I have no idea what church modes are like nowadays.</p></div><h3><a id=100480 href="#100480">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2011 10:29:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike, please read the this on Riemann to see that the dichotomy of major<br/>&gt; and minor is a farce.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002031364.pdf_<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002031364.pdf">http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002031364.pdf</a>)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg showed that minor came to us through church modes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Lobawad, the true minor third is in the overtone series.</p><p>The true minor third is the one that emodies the ineffable I wish to eff, in that time and place.</p></div><h3><a id=100483 href="#100483">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2011 10:59:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Perhaps utonality is essentially a Partch artifice which worked well for<br/>&gt; his music.

And if you do the 7-limit version, which is<br/>&gt; like D7-&gt;C but with the D7 tuned 4:5:6:7 (keeping the C held constant,<br/>&gt; so the D is 8/7), it&apos;s relaxing. And the 11-limit version is also<br/>&gt; relaxing. And if you combine them you get things like Fm6 -&gt; Cmaj,<br/>&gt; which is also very relaxing and almost mystical. Try C-E-G-A# -&gt;<br/>&gt; E-G#-Cx-F#-A# -&gt; A#-Cx-E#-A# in 19-equal, which should be something<br/>&gt; like 4:5:6:7 -&gt; 4:5:7:9:11 -&gt; 4:5:6:8. It sounds like a higher-limit<br/>&gt; version of a plagal cadence to me. So there&apos;s something to be said for<br/>&gt; keeping the root constant and building nice harmonic chords underneath<br/>&gt; it, and that&apos;s all I can say for now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Absolutely. I don&apos;t buy a strong cultural/relativist position at all, and I find contemptible those who do such things as ignore the 2:1 ratio of the octave in their attempts to paint the whole thing as learned and not connected to the harmonic series. If you think I&apos;m making that up, read some recent Parncutt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Parncutt thinks that 2/1 is learned? Can you point me to some recent Parncutt?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;There must be some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way that this behavior &quot;naturally&quot; emerges from the meantone &gt;cognitive<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; structure all by itself, for a listener that understands meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; logic.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now you&apos;re off on a tangent.

And if you play 6/5 and you play a<br/>bass note a major third down from the bottom now, the 6/5 sounds like<br/>it&apos;s part of a major chord, and if you double the bottom note instead,<br/>it sounds like a minor chord.</p><p>I think that the brain simply integrates all of the pitches existing<br/>at a certain point in time - including virtual ones, and including<br/>ones you&apos;re imagining -  when a pitch briefly flickers into existence<br/>down in the bottom register, your brain just makes note of it as one<br/>of the pitches in the chord and moves on.</p><p>I did yet another experiment a while ago that I&apos;ll have to post, which<br/>is that I worked with a timbre that was maximally inharmonic - it was<br/>basically 9:11:13:15:17:19:21:etc (not exactly, but that was the gist<br/>of it). My brain heard it as flipping between having a VF that was<br/>equal to the bottom note (meaning as though it were a flat<br/>4:5:6:7:8:9:etc), and a VF a minor third below that, meaning as though<br/>it were a sharp 5:6:7:8:9:10). So I kept hearing two VFs a minor third<br/>apart flipping in and out of existence, and you can imagine what my<br/>perception of the chord was - I heard the lowest two notes of an<br/>arpeggiated &quot;minor&quot; chord flipping back and forth randomly.</p><p>There is an integrative mechanism that tracks what notes are played,<br/>even if those notes are &quot;virtual&quot; notes, because psychoacoustically,<br/>all notes are virtual.

Yes, I  know the 4/3 still occurs and<br/>&gt; that is fine.  Just don&apos;t forcefit it into  the scale.

That gets beaten<br/>about until page 17, when &quot;. . . harmonic dualism, taken at<br/>its basic level, is the postulate of theoretical<br/>equivalence between the major and minor systems. There is<br/>little controversy about this point.&quot;  So harmonic dualism<br/>is essentially correct, but let&apos;s define it so that it<br/>becomes wrong, or argue about it regardless.</p><p>If we turn to reality, we can say that undertones don&apos;t<br/>really exist, and nobody other than Riemann ever seemed to<br/>think they did.  That doesn&apos;t make a dualistic approach of<br/>major and minor a farce.  We know that major and minor<br/>triads have the same intervals.  Plomp and Levelt, and<br/>later theorists who were interested in the reality of human<br/>perception, produced models of sensory consonance that are<br/>purely dyadic and so naturally dualistic.  A diatonic scale<br/>with major triads will also have minor triads with a<br/>5-limit tuning following their major counterparts.</p><p>In reality, we also know that virtual pitch recognition<br/>favors major over minor.  But music theory should say the<br/>same thing.  Minor keys involve movable pitches to give<br/>more major triads.  You won&apos;t find that argument in the<br/>cited PDF though.</p><p>Another reason to consider utonalities is that traditional<br/>scales can arise from equal divisions of a string or pipe.<br/>Utonal scales are proven melodically.  They have the same<br/>constituent intervals as otonal scales.  A utonality will<br/>have pitches closer together at the bottom than the top,<br/>whereas an otonal scale will be the other way round.<br/>Combining the otonal and utonal gives you balance --<br/>between high and low and melody and harmony.  That was<br/>Partch&apos;s insight and in his time it was a good one.  It<br/>saved him from the trap of retuning the major scale to fix<br/>the major triads.</p><p>You can say that reality prefers the otonal to the utonal.<br/>Most of us would agree -- higher-limit utonal chords don&apos;t<br/>work nearly as well as their otonal counterparts.  But<br/>reality, as it applies to human perception, still runs into<br/>difficulty in the 32 to 64 range.</p><p>I&apos;m now going to consume huge quantities of vitamin C<br/>on the grounds that the scientific prestige of Pauling&apos;s<br/>work automatically puts him &apos;in the right&apos;.

I have some real studying to get back to. Our conversation has to be very fluid, moving back and forth between the natural and physical and then&nbsp;to conceptual or strictly theoretical. Sometimes the line blurs. there will be areas of &quot;understood movements&quot; where we don&apos;t even explain where we are coming from. That is cool and certainly part of the process.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>It is true that music is relative (on a universal basis).&nbsp; Harmony, ie the full spectrum of tonality from consonance to dissonance, is relative to the sharing of math properties between one set or scale and another. This proves itself as you compare one scale with another...also one process or treatment and another. It doesn&apos;t do much good to argue over the validity of one procedure over another, because, like you said it is all&nbsp;relative&nbsp;...so, we do need to be open to any system for the reason of comparative study, if for no other.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Strict interpretation of systems like equal temperament or just intonation may yield fixed results, but&nbsp; doesn&apos;t even begin to touch on all the other data that is available. The same can be said for the interpretation of natural scales derived from the nhs.&nbsp;Complete music study screams out that we should be open minded.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Going from math that includes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,&nbsp; moving into algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, doesn&apos;t even come close to the world of calculus and advanced physics. It is mind blowing to think that there are imaginary sets and numbers in music study, the same can be said for imaginary processes and treatments applied on all levels.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>That said, I would like to&nbsp;say that I am open to the concept that the letter values we commonly associate with music do indeed&nbsp; have multiple values when we apply them to multiple systems...</p><p>(A ) B C in 12tet does not have the same value as ( A) B C in a Base 11 natural scale.&nbsp; Also ratios in one system do take on other interval values in multiple systems. &nbsp;I&apos;ve already shown how what is commonly known as a &quot;major scale step&quot; can become a &quot;quarter tone value&quot; when applied in another tuning system.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>See what I mean about being open minded?&nbsp; For instance, by being open minded, &nbsp;I can accept your position that multiple base natural scales are a subset of the broader picture of the nhs&nbsp;&nbsp; WIth an understanding of both lineal and exponetial scales in my musical background, I do agree that there isn&apos;t just one way to go in this whole thing.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Thanks again<br/>Tim</p><p>--- On Wed, 7/6/11, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Clarification of my comments on Igs&apos; 32-64 program<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, July 6, 2011, 6:47 PM</p><p>On Wed, Jul 6, 2011 at 12:51 PM, Tim Reeves &lt;reevest360@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This might explain the difference in our reasoning:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In describing a ratio for musical purposes &nbsp;I state that when you have a ratio such as&nbsp;9/8 or m/n, the top number or m = the number value of the harmonic in the sequence<br/>&gt; &nbsp;and&nbsp;the bottom number, or &nbsp;n = the number of notes in the octave at that point in the series.</p><p>These ratios signify different just intervals.

It doesn&apos;t do much good to argue over the validity of one procedure over another, because, like you said it is all&nbsp;relative&nbsp;...so, we do need to be open to any system for the reason of comparative study, if for no other.</p><p>You can think of things however you&apos;d like - if you prefer to think of<br/>7/4 as being a single note in a 4-note scale, you are free to do so.<br/>However, we need to communicate, and around here, the convention that<br/>has been used since I&apos;ve joined, and in the decade and a half prior,<br/>and in all of the music theory literature I&apos;ve ever seen on the<br/>subject, is that 7/4 just signifies an interval. So it&apos;s confusing if<br/>you now want to impose an alternate terminology. And even so, if you<br/>want something like 7/4 to signify a scale, how are we supposed to<br/>refer to JI intervals?</p><p>&gt; Strict interpretation of systems like equal temperament or just intonation may yield fixed results, but&nbsp; doesn&apos;t even begin to touch on all the other data that is available. The same can be said for the interpretation of natural scales derived from the nhs.&nbsp;Complete music study screams out that we should be open minded.</p><p>We&apos;re not all about equal temperaments or JI. Most of the research on<br/>this list has to do with temperaments in between those.
