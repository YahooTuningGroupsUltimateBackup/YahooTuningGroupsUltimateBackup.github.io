I and most others, I believe, have to<br/>some epsilon good color memory. In other words, what I call red now I will<br/>call red later, and I will always know when something is the color of Grey<br/>Poupon, not just that it is darker than Hellman&apos;s. Further, Dijon mustard<br/>a few shades lighter or darker than Grey Poupon won&apos;t bother me at all.<br/>&#x9;I have a friend who is studying one of those send away ear<br/>training courses that pins pitch to color, and it seems to be working for<br/>him in just the ideal way I described above. I suppose someone with<br/>perfect pitch who always listened to music in 12tet centered at 440 may<br/>find music centered around 420 jarring at first, but if he couldn&apos;t learn<br/>to adjust to that or some other tuning system, it would be a mighty sorry<br/>skill to have.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>11/5/1999 8:19:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;..., what I call red now I will<br/>&gt;call red later, and I will always know when something is the color of Grey<br/>&gt;Poupon, not just that it is darker than Hellman&apos;s.

Then he<br/>started performing early music with A-415. At first he heard everything a<br/>half step lower, but as he became accustomed to playing the A-415 keyboard<br/>gig after gig, he began to associate 415 with A. After some years of this,<br/>he can no longer distinguish them. That is, if you play a pitch for him he<br/>will tell you that it is either A or Ab, but he doesn&apos;t know which.</p><p>Some researchers distinguish in-born perfect pitch from pitch memory. A<br/>choral director I had trained our choir to sing an E before each rehearsal<br/>without prompting from the keyboard. After a few weeks, everyone was able<br/>to do it. When humming a song I have heard on the radio, I will often hum<br/>it in the same key for days afterward. If I practice, I can use such<br/>abilities to figure out within a semitone or so what a pitch is, but some<br/>people distinguish this ability from the innate and naive ability to<br/>immediately associate a sound with a named pitch as if they were seeing a<br/>color.</p><p>I&apos;m with those who dispute the value of such a skill. For me part of the<br/>glory and power of music lies in the relativity of pitch. In ear training<br/>classes when doing melodic dictation, they would have the students notate<br/>the melody in a different key than what was played. Invariably, the perfect<br/>pitch students would have a harder time than the others. I have played just<br/>intonation pieces for people with perfect pitch who cringed, not at the<br/>music, but at the dissonance it made with their expectations. That&apos;s not<br/>the sort of skill I&apos;d like to acquire.</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

For them, memorization<br/>of notes is not really an issue, and they seem to have a direct  link<br/>between their inner-ear and their  instrument. My friend Susan, a pianist<br/>who was invited to attend the Curtis Institute at an early age, can play<br/>anything shes ever heard, even once, on the piano complete with correct<br/>voicings etc.</p><p>So while I would not say that perfect pitch is what enables these musicians<br/>to do what they do, it seems to be a common component of exceptional musical<br/>talent. I second the color analogy- I think a painter who could only tell<br/>that a given color was redder than another given color, but in isolation<br/>could not identify it at all - would be at a disadvantage. It is no doubt<br/>due to the fact that most of our brains are heavily invested in the visual<br/>area that it is common to be able to remember colors and identify them so<br/>easily. (Yes, as John L mentioned, context does influence this but not<br/>entirely).</p><p>All the claims of the superiority of relative over perfect pitch have always<br/>sounded like sour grapes to me. Its like being able to see only in black and<br/>white, and claiming that its better than seeing colors &apos;cause colors only<br/>distract you from appreciating the linear composition of your visual field.<br/>(Come to think of it, that &gt;is&lt; why black and white photography is so cool.<br/>hmmm.) All in all, if I could I think I would have perfect pitch, not so<br/>when the radiator hisses I can say &quot;C#&quot;, but because of the increased<br/>sensitivity to musical meaning that seems to accompany the ability.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/1999 8:42:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I&apos;m not sure of the utility of perfect pitch in itself, but when I think of<br/>&gt;the musicians i know who have it, they are all exceptionally talented and<br/>&gt;seem to &quot;speak the language&quot; of music more easily and naturally than poor<br/>&gt;suckers like myself who struggle with relative pitch.</p><p>This has been my experience as well.

Fact is, when people<br/>jokingly ask me &quot;What note&apos;s this?&quot; and then bang on a garbage can, I may<br/>not be able to define all the pitches in terms of our known scales, but,<br/>I&apos;ll remember that particular garbage can&apos;s &quot;chord&quot; if I hear it later. Ya<br/>know the movie &quot;Sneakers?&quot; Although I&apos;ve not been called upon yet to give<br/>this kind of evidence, I&apos;m a virtual audio-speedometer in a car where I&apos;m<br/>familiar with its mechanical noises or, when crossing one of those &quot;wake-up&quot;<br/>things in the highway, the pitch tells me what speed we&apos;re going.<br/>When I&apos;m building electronic equipment, I use audible test instruments. My<br/>&quot;sound memory&quot; means that I can use an extremely simple circuit that changes<br/>pitch with a changing value of voltage, resistance etc. to get a reading of<br/>practical use.<br/>I do a lot of modifications of recordings. If I want to filter out noise<br/>that has obvious formants, I can immediately set the filters for the<br/>frequencies that my sound memory tells me are the ones to be reduced.<br/>And, of course, while waiting for trains or boats or planes, I&apos;m not bored.<br/>I have my choice of things to play literally in my head. It could be<br/>Machaut, Schubert, or a Stockhausen electronic thing. I can reproduce any of<br/>it in my head with equal clarity.<br/>As I mentioned before, the down side takes some practice to overcome. By now<br/>I can play on a keyboard that&apos;s not tuned to standard pitch without too much<br/>hesitation, and when singing in a choir I have no trouble adjusting to pitch<br/>fluctuations. So in conclusion, most of the stuff I hear about perfect pitch<br/>seems to be what we&apos;ve been conditioned to believe according to the emphases<br/>found in our musical tradition.
