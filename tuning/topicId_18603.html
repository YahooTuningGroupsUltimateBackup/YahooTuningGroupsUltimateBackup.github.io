margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I checked out a layman&apos;s description of the Classic mediant, and I found<br/>this to be interesting.</p><p>I find it hard to get my head around the term COMPLEXITY, due to the fact<br/>that an annoying idea keeps coming up into my head, and this being the<br/>number of digits in the numerator, and denominator.</p><p>I supposse that complexity would be related to the numerator and denominator<br/>in the closness that each sahres to 2^n, and how big n is, thus something<br/>like 17/16 is more complex than 5/8, and something like 367/112 is more<br/>complex than 17/16.</p><p>I know that with respect to subtracting logarithmic intervals, effectively<br/>we are divideing, and that:</p><p>a^b/a^c=a^(b-c).</p><p>and I have been tinkering around, with mathematical recreations with expanding:</p><p>(a+b)^n, and (a+b)^^n, or superpowers, and taking their mirror images.</p><p>On a wee bit of a tangent here, I will state that it&apos;s difficule to find<br/>rules for:</p><p>(a+b)^^4 as:</p><p>(a+b)^^2= (a+b)^a * (a+b)^b, and</p><p>(a+b)^^3= (a+b)^[(a+b)^a * (a+b)^b]= [ (a+b)^[(a+b)^a] ] ^ [(a+b)^b]=<br/>          =(a+b)^ [ (a+b)^ [a+b] ]</p><p>but...</p><p>(a+b)^^4 = Is a lt more tricky.</p><p>I would also like to know if there is a set of rules for:</p><p>(a^(a^(a^x))) * (a^(a^(a^x)) = a^[a^(a^x)) +<br/>a^(a^x)]=???===&gt;a^[a^{(a^x)[k](a^x)}]</p><p>Applying this mediant formulae we get:</p><p>a/b &lt;===&gt; c/d = a[1]c/b[1]d, where the number in parenthesis is a number<br/>representing order of operations.</p><p>This proceudre of taking mediants it similar to a sucessive sereis of ratios<br/>that converge towards the square root of two, which has us start with:</p><p>1  3   5   12    29<br/>-, -, ---, ---, ----<br/>1  2   7   17    41...</p><p>The procedure for generateing these ratios is as follows, and isn&apos;t<br/>immediately obvious, but we start with 1/1, and 3/2, and add all of these<br/>terms to get 7, and place this in the denominator.</p><p>The sucessive ratios numerator and denominator gives 7.</p><p>So it is like adding:</p><p>        Numerator         Denominator<br/>           ---            --------<br/>          |   |          |   |    |<br/>          |   |          |   |    |<br/>          |   |          --------<br/>          |   |          |   |    |<br/>          |   |          |   |    |<br/>           --             --------</p><p>Given that:</p><p>(5+9):(4+7) === (a+b):(c+d)</p><p>(9+14):(7+11) === (b+a+b):(c+d+d) = (a+2b):(c+2d)</p><p>(14+23):(11+18) === (a+2b+a+b):(c+2d+c+d)= (2a+3b):(2c+3d)</p><p>Looking at what you&apos;d get from this convergeing series that gives the square<br/>root of two, you will se an identical pattern!!!!</p><p>Anyhow, I will go onto this further.</p><p>What interests me is the concept of using other n-bonacci ratios to weight<br/>these intervals:</p><p>a:b, and c:d</p><p>and to compare:</p><p>xa + yx<br/>-------/<br/>xb + yd</p><p>effectively we are having weighted mediants by what I call the RELATIVE<br/>GOLDEN PROPORTION, which are a whole lot of &quot;false constants&quot; that we get<br/>when leding up to the golden proportion.</p><p>I woundered if medianst could be made out of THREE ratios???</p><p>a:b, c:d, e:f</p><p>=</p><p>a+c+e                       xa+yc+ze<br/>-----/, and from this:  ----------------<br/>b+d+f                       bx+yd+zf</p><p>and perhas x, y, and z could be 1, golden proportion, and the tribonacci<br/>ratio 1.839...</p><p>I also found information about a very funny little sequence which involved a<br/>definition in mathematics called &quot;recursions&quot;, where by what previous terms<br/>we added was defined by the terms THEMSELVES.</p><p>It is thus a case of double subscripts, and to illustrate:</p><p>Q-Sereis:</p><p>T_n=T_(n-T_(n-1)) + T_(n-T_(n-2)), with T_1=1=T_2 which also = 1.</p><p>This series is similar to the definition used for the Fibonacci sereis but<br/>with the Fibonacci series, we sum the IMMEDIATE two values, and those values<br/>IMMEDIATELY PREVIOUS to T_n.</p><p>With this Q-Series, the previous two terms tell us HOW FAR TO COUNT BACK.</p><p>Thus:</p><p>1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 10, | 9, 10 |...........<br/>                     |  |                   -------<br/>                      5+6=11                   |<br/>                                               | ---------&gt;How far left to move</p><p>To obtaint eh next term, move leftwards from the three dots 10 and 9 terms,<br/>take the sum, and we&apos;d get 11.</p><p>This is T_18.</p><p>Continiueing this sequence:</p><p>11, 9, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 16...etc..</p><p>I have woundered now if any recursive sequences might generate music, many<br/>prime numbers (...with a high density of primes), proportions of n-bonaccis,<br/>and I suggest:</p><p>T_n=T_(n-T_(n-T_(n-1)) + T_(n-T_(n-T_(n-3))), with T_1=T_2=T_3=1</p><p>How far can we take theis recursion?</p><p>---Sarn.</p></div>
