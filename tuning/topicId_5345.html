Could you provide more substance,<br/>&gt;&gt; please?</p><p>One possibility would be to adjust the tuning based<br/>on the partials (spectrum) of the notes being played.<br/>This would be the same as adjusting to simple integer<br/>ratios if the sounds had harmonic overtones, but would<br/>be different otherwise.</p><p>Another idea would be to adjust the tuning so as<br/>to achieve a certain rate of beating among the<br/>partials (i.e, adjusting to beatlessnes is not the<br/>only sensible goal). This is sometimes stated as a goal of<br/>gamelan tuners in poetic terms - to make the tones &quot;shimmer&quot;.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>Clark &#x3C;caccola@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/1999 5:00:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill,</p><p>&gt; One possibility would be to adjust the tuning based<br/>&gt; on the partials (spectrum) of the notes being played.<br/>&gt;<br/>Do you mean by this an idea similar to the tuning of pianos, where the<br/>perceived  ratios are retained but due inharmonicity don&apos;t correspond with<br/>an absolute spectrum, if so wouldn&apos;t this sort of on the fly retuning be<br/>analogous to instrumentalists adjusting their intonation to match that of<br/>the piano? This would imply both maximizing the consonance of the moment and<br/>a more horizontal intonational memory similar to the melodic relations of<br/>the piece.</p><p>Clark</p></div>
