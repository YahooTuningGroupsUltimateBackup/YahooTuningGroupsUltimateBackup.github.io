Notes can only go on the lines and never in &gt;between them. There<br/>&gt;    are never any accidentals used. Each note has its own name. Every<br/>note is<br/>&gt;a color and every<br/>&gt;    color is a note. A color-coded strip is placed across the<br/>keyboard as a<br/>&gt;reference. This also<br/>&gt;    allows the performer to improvise if he/she is not playing a<br/>specific<br/>&gt;piece of notated music.<br/>&gt;            I doubt if this would ever become a &quot;standard&quot; , but do<br/>you think<br/>&gt;it has merit in<br/>&gt;    its simplicity ?</p><p>Absolutely. If it works for you and your instrument, go for it.</p><p>I suppose that could be considered a form of keyboard tablature (a<br/>notation that tells you directly where to put your fingers) as much as<br/>an encoding of pitch.</p><p>But of course it wouldn&apos;t necessarily be the best format for other<br/>purposes such as for playing other instruments or for analysing harmony.<br/>===============================================<br/>STEPHEN SZPAK WRITES IN REPONSE::::::::::::::</p><p>  Hi Dave</p><p>Thanks for your encouragement here. I couldn&apos;t imagine myself, or anyone else<br/>flowing effortlessly without a color-coded strip.Even I can&apos;t just yet, but I think I will<br/>before I hit the 500 hour mark of practicing with it.<br/>  I can see it wouldn&apos;t work for analysing harmony now. I didn&apos;t think about that.<br/>====================================================</p><p>&gt;  Or any other way?  This is what I practice using, so I won&apos;t be changing<br/>&gt;    what I do, but I was wondering about the idea for anyone else.  I<br/>sort of<br/>&gt;assume that people<br/>&gt;    playing in 19EDO , 17 EDO and perhaps other divisions of the<br/>octave must<br/>&gt;use a color-coded<br/>&gt;    strip right? How do they improvise on the spot without one?</p><p>I&apos;ll leave that for others to comment on.</p><p>&gt;     Also, I didn&apos;t fully understand what you wrote above<br/>(accidentals were<br/>&gt;included in both<br/>&gt;     references, so since I knew what I had in mind didn&apos;t have<br/>accidentals,<br/>&gt;I included my idea<br/>&gt;     above) .  Is there a website besides <a href="http://sonic-arts.org">sonic-arts.org</a> that explains &gt;microtonal terms? What&apos;s<br/>&gt;     really sad is I&apos;m not sure &quot;chain of best fifths&quot; is a<br/>microtonal term<br/>&gt;or not. Thanks.</p><p>In this case what I mean by &quot;chain of best fifths&quot; notation is to find<br/>the closest approximation to a 2:3 frequency ratio in the equal<br/>temperament and notate a chain of 7 of these as FCGDAE, unless the<br/>circle closes before 7, as it does in the case of 15-EDO, in which<br/>case we center on D for an odd number and on the DA fifth for an even<br/>number.<br/>==============================================<br/>STEPHEN SZPAK RESPONDS:</p><p>  You, and others, don&apos;t know how much I don&apos;t know, you know?<br/>  First I don&apos;t think it&apos;s wise to continue trying to explain the rest of what<br/>  you&apos;ve written here.

There is no D in 15 EDO.<br/>======================================================<br/>The number of degrees making the best fifth in n-EDO is given by<br/>Round(n*ln(3/2)/ln(2)).</p><p>The best fifth of 15-EDO is 3 degrees which of course closes a circle<br/>after it is chained five times, CGDAE.<br/>=====================================================<br/>STEPHEN SZPAK WRITES:<br/>According to Tonalsoft Encyclopaedia of Tuning:</p><p>   degree:</p><p>            1) refers to the ordinal &quot;steps&quot; in a diatonic scale<br/>            2) refers to the pitches in an equal-tempered scale, one<br/>                degree being the basic &quot;step&quot; size in the scale</p><p>        So, I guess the degree in 15 EDO must be 80 cents. The &quot;best fifth of 15-EDO is<br/>        3 degrees&quot;. So the &quot;best fifth&quot; is 3 times 80 = 240 cents. 5 times 240 = 1200 cents<br/>        which makes a full octave. Even if this is correct I don&apos;t see the relevance of it.<br/>======================================================</p><p>Then we need accidentals which<br/>take us up and down by one degree to get us to the other two parallel<br/>closed chains. In Sagittal we suggest using the accidental that<br/>represents the 5-comma (81/80). Then, for example, the closest<br/>approximation to a just major triad on C is notated C E\ G, as it is<br/>in just about every other tuning where the 5-comma doesn&apos;t vanish.</p><p>==================================================<br/>STEPHEN SZPAK RESPONDS:</p><p>   The notes of 15 EDO are all 80 cents apart one from the other, why would a accidental<br/>   of (81/80) 21.5 cents take you up or down one note?</p><p>   A comma is 21.5 cents. The closest thing that reminds me of that is the perfect 5th,<br/>   being off by 20 cents in comparison to 12 EDO or about 18 cents for JI.  Are you saying<br/>   that by going up by 720 cents in 15 EDO for five times you get back where you started...thereby<br/>   causing the comma (actually an approximation of it) to disappear?<br/>=============================================================<br/>Blackwood&apos;s notation works this way too but rather than limit the<br/>nominals to CGDAE he allows B as a synonym for C and F as a synonym<br/>for E, and goes further to allow sharps and flats so that the<br/>following notes above each other are synonyms.<br/>Dd Ab Eb Bb F<br/>C  G  D  A  E<br/>B  F# C# G# D#<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p><p>  Stephen Szpak</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Worried about inbox overload?
