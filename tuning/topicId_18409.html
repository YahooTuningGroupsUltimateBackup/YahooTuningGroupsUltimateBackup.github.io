Nicola Vicentino<br/>(1511-1576) made such progressions a hallmark of his style, presented<br/>as a kind of &quot;adaption&quot; of the Greek enharmonic genus to modern<br/>16th-century music with its use of temperament and of complex<br/>polyphony.</p><p>Maybe a few progressions, with an asterisk (*) showing a note raised<br/>by a diesis, may show some of the possibilities. First, here&apos;s a kind<br/>of cadential ornament:</p><p>Eb4-Eb*4-E4<br/>C4<br/>G3<br/>C3</p><p>Here, above the stationary lower parts, the upper voice moves through<br/>two fifthtone steps from a usual minor third to Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate<br/>minor third&quot; for which he gives the approximate ratio 5-1/2:4-1/2 (or<br/>in other words 11:9) to a concluding regular major third (pure in the<br/>1/4-comma tuning which seems a likely choice for Vicentino&apos;s<br/>instruments).</p><p>On my 24-note subset of Vicentino&apos;s 36-note keyboard (in its complete<br/>version featuring a circulating 31-note meantone cycle plus a few<br/>extra notes to give pure fifths to some common diatonic notes on the<br/>lower 19-note manual), the manuals are a diesis apart, so notes with<br/>asterisks are played on the upper keyboard. Since Vicentino&apos;s 36-note<br/>or 38-note design is based on two 19-note manuals, the note locations<br/>are often somewhat different, but he likewise uses a dot above a note<br/>(my ASCII asterisk) to show a note raised by a diesis.</p><p>Also, there are usual 16th-century progressions with altered<br/>intervals, e.g.</p><p>G*4  A4               D5  C#*5<br/>D*4  F4               G4  A*4<br/>B*3  C4               D4  E*4<br/>G*3  F3       or      Bb3 A*3</p><p>Here we have the usual vertical meantone intervals (approximating the<br/>ideal of 5-limit JI), but the altered melodic step of a minor semitone<br/>B*3-C4 in the second-to-lowest voice of the first example, or D5-C#*5<br/>and Bb3-A3 in the outer voices of the second example, normally the<br/>chromatic semitone (~76.05 cents in 1/4-comma). This is a semitone of<br/>about 2/5-tone rather than the usual 3/5-tone (~117.1 cents in<br/>1/4-comma).</p><p>Also, in these progressions, we have motions by a large whole-tone of<br/>about 6/5-tone or ~234.2 cents in 1/4-comma, e.g. G*3-F3 or D4-E*4.</p><p>While Vicentino speaks of a diesis as a fifth of a tone, in 1/4-comma<br/>this is an approximate model, since we actually get two slightly<br/>unequal fifthtone steps within a chromatic semitone, e.g. C-C*-C#,<br/>roughly 41.06 cents (the 128:125 diesis) and 34.99 cents (the<br/>chromatic semitone less this diesis, a difference which it happens is<br/>very close to 50:49). This is close enough that counting fifthtones is<br/>a very practical guide to the intervals, making a 31-note tuning in<br/>1/4-comma a circulating system despite the slight theoretical<br/>asymmetry.</p><p>In 31-tET, the fifthtone measurements would precisely apply, and by<br/>the middle of the 17th century, Lemme Rossi (1666) associates<br/>Vicentino&apos;s instrument with this temperament.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d forgotten about 22.  It would be the simplest on the list,<br/>&gt; because it&apos;d only need 22 notes.  So if you used all 22 notes, you&apos;d<br/>&gt; get each chord at 22 different pitches.</p><p>This is another benefit of 22, maybe especially for people who focus<br/>on circulation (something of a special effect in my outlook on<br/>neo-Gothic, but possibly a central feature of some style in this<br/>general area which someone might devise).</p><p>I must admit that often I simply tune 12 of 22, since a 12-note range<br/>covers most Gothic music; however, there are some neat effects which<br/>the full gamut makes available apart from the circulation question,<br/>for example a cadence like</p><p>D4  E4 F4<br/>A#3 B3 C4<br/>G3     F4</p><p>Here the first sonority has the &quot;schisma-like&quot; augmented second of<br/>22-tET, 7/22 octave, analogous to a Pythagorean diminished fourth,<br/>close to 5:4, in a &quot;split fifth&quot; sonority (outer fifth, two thirds);<br/>the voices then move to a regular major third and sixth (8/22 octave,<br/>17/22 octave) near 9:7 and 12:7, expanding as usual to fifth and<br/>octave.</p><p>Here, in neo-Gothic terms, the shift of a 22-tET step A#3-B3 moves us<br/>from a 5-flavor to a usual 7-flavor major third; as in a typical<br/>meantone, we don&apos;t have intermediate flavors like Pythagorean (81:64)<br/>or 14:11 (&quot;11-flavor&quot;).</p><p>&gt; Meantone is simpler than schismic because you get 15 6:7:9 chords<br/>&gt; for your 24 notes.  With positive tuning, you only get 8 6:7:9<br/>&gt; chords.</p><p>In part, this depends upon the musical style: I find the eight<br/>locations in a Pythagorean-region tuning to be the ones I&apos;m typically<br/>interested in, although more don&apos;t hurt. Again, as someone accustomed<br/>to a &quot;normal&quot; range of Eb-G# for accidentals, my view might be<br/>different than someone trained in musical styles where more remote<br/>accidentals are quite the norm.</p><p>Also, positive tunings vary somewhat: with the e-based tuning at<br/>around 704.61 cents, I get 10 sonorities approximating 6:7:9, because<br/>~9:7 is 13 fourths up and ~7:6 is 14 fifths up.</p><p>However, it&apos;s important to emphasize that typically I tune up a<br/>positive tuning for neo-Gothic because the regular intervals fit the<br/>style, just as the meantone ones fit a Renaissance style. It&apos;s<br/>probably this basic convenience that leads to me use positive tunings<br/>for Gothic/neo-Gothic and meantones for Renaissance, although you&apos;re<br/>very right as well as creative to show that the reverse arrangements<br/>are not merely possible but have their own advantages also.</p><p>&gt; So that&apos;s conceptual simplicity on the 2-keyboard setup.  You&apos;re<br/>&gt; simplifying meantone in that context to make it structurally<br/>&gt; identical to:</p><p>[I&apos;m not sure if there might be missing text here -- Margo]</p><p>Yes, there&apos;s no special historical precedent for a 12x2 meantone<br/>keyboard setup, it&apos;s just one solution of convenience. Maybe this kind<br/>of approach has something in common with the very different<br/>&quot;generalized keyboard&quot; concept: the one common element is the idea<br/>that the manuals should have equivalent intervals mapped to the same<br/>keys. This idea can be expressed by either 12x2 or some generalized<br/>keyboard in the usual sense; maybe Fabio Colonna&apos;s _Sambuca Lincea_ of<br/>1618 (the &quot;Lynxian sambuca,&quot; named in honor of the &quot;Academy of Lynxes&quot;<br/>in which Galileo was a member), with five seven-note manuals tuned at<br/>intervals of 1/5-tone, is an early example.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Curiously, I consider a 24-note tuning in many ways less intricate<br/>&gt;&gt; than a 19-note tuning, since the symmetry of the two &quot;generalized&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; 12-note keyboards can help in finding intervals and cadences.</p><p>&gt; A 19-note tuning would really need a 19-note keyboard.  If you had<br/>&gt; such a keyboard, the tuning would be very simple.</p><p>True, and such a keyboard, unlike my 24-note version, has a firm<br/>historical basis. Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo (1555) could be described<br/>as two 19-note manuals with the usual split keys, with E# and B# keys<br/>on the lower manual of his practical 36-note version, or on both<br/>manuals in his ideal 38-note version (which ran into technical<br/>problems).</p><p>Costeley (1570) describes a similar 19-note keyboard for 19-tET, and<br/>19-note keyboards or _cembali chromatici_ (&quot;chromatic harpsichords)<br/>had some vogue in Naples around 1600, the environment of the famed<br/>composer Gesualdo, where keyboard composers such as Trabaci wrote<br/>pieces especially for this instrument.</p><p>&gt; You get some near-7 ratios with 12-note meantone as well.  But<br/>&gt; 22-equal with a chain-of-fifths mapping gives the majority of thirds<br/>&gt; as 9-limit without 5.  Usually, this wouldn&apos;t be my preferred<br/>&gt; mapping, but the neo-Gothic lens makes everything look different.</p><p>That&apos;s a really important point: n-limit terminology may not really<br/>fit neo-Gothic, and from a neo-Gothic point of view regular major<br/>thirds in 22-tET (chain-of-fifths mapping) at around 9:7 and 7:6 are<br/>the main attraction, with the others more of a &quot;special effect.&quot;</p><p>Incidentally, in neo-Gothic terms, both 9:7 and 7:6 are &quot;7-flavor,&quot;<br/>because they are based on factors of 7; it may be natural in this<br/>setting to group them together, because they or their octave<br/>complements typically arise in a division of the fifth (6:7:9 or<br/>14:18:21) or major sixth (7:9:12) where one implies the other.</p><p>However, in a music where a 7-limit sonority such as 4:5:6:7 is<br/>common, the contrast between &quot;7-limit&quot; and &quot;9-limit&quot; makes great<br/>sense.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Among listed systems, the next most accurate is 36-tET, with two<br/>&gt;&gt; manuals at 1/6-tone (~33.33 cents) apart. This tempers the fifths<br/>&gt;&gt; by about 1.95 cents, here in the narrow direction, and gives us,<br/>&gt;&gt; overall, more accurate 7-based approximations than any of the<br/>&gt;&gt; more heavily tempered alternatives.</p><p>&gt; Yes, that comes from 12-equal being a good approximation to<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning.  So whatever chords &quot;work&quot; will work in at least<br/>&gt; 12 positions.</p><p>True, 12-tET (or the &quot;usual&quot; 12-tET intervals on each keyboard of a<br/>24-out-of-36 scheme) is a compromise between Pythagorean and meantone,<br/>but weighted more toward the Pythagorean side. In certain kinder and<br/>gentler timbres, this _might_ be acceptable for mixing Renaissance and<br/>neo-Gothic styles, but with a slant toward neo-Gothic rather than<br/>toward meantone thirds for the Renaissance sonorities.</p><p>In addition to the 2-3-7 sonorities, I like the &quot;17-flavor&quot; ones --<br/>submajor and supraminor thirds at 366.67 and 333.33 cents, providing a<br/>division of the fifth close to 14:17:21 (0-333-700 cents). These<br/>sonorities, also characteristic of regular tunings around 704 cents,<br/>make some neat neo-Gothic cadences.</p><p>&gt; Another one I hadn&apos;t considered.  I wonder how it&apos;d work with each<br/>&gt; manual tuned to a traditional well temperament.</p><p>In 24 notes, there could be interesting possibilities here that I<br/>hadn&apos;t considered. Once, for fun, I proposed the idea of a<br/>Vallotti-Young with the diatonic and chromatic fifths reversed to make<br/>the most commonly used thirds near-Pythagorean. Since then, I&apos;ve<br/>concluded that a 17-note well-temperament (with 17-tET as a point of<br/>departure) may be typical for neo-Gothic -- but the idea of applying<br/>the 24-note concept to 12-note well-temperaments is a whole new<br/>question.</p><p>&gt; The minimax tuning for these intervals is where 7:6 is just.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; a fifth of 696.319 cents.  9:7, 7:4 and 3:2 are all 5.6 cents out.</p><p>That&apos;s close to Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone, and not too far from<br/>1/4-comma. It&apos;s a fascinating point of symmetry, maybe a bit like<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma for the major and minor thirds (both varying from<br/>pure by 1/7 comma).</p><p>&gt; For the full 9-limit excluding 5, 9:8 would be the furthest interval<br/>&gt; equally mistuned, and 7:4 just.  That&apos;s a lot closer to 31-equal.</p><p>Yes, for 10 fifths up or an augmented sixth to equal a 7:4, we&apos;d have<br/>a fifth of around 696.88 cents, or about 5.07 cents narrow, slightly<br/>wider than 31-tET (~5.18 cents).</p><p>One fine point: in a neo-Gothic setting, I&apos;d tend to associate 9:8<br/>with a &quot;3-limit,&quot; so to speak, since it&apos;s defined as the &quot;difference<br/>of the consonances&quot; between a 3:2 fifth and a 4:3 fourth; it&apos;s present<br/>or approximated a 12-note Pythagorean or near-Pythagorean tuning,<br/>while something like 9:7 involves ratios of 7 (the &quot;7-flavor&quot;), not<br/>present in a basic 12-note Pythagorean scheme.</p><p>However, each setting has its own logical associations and groupings<br/>of intervals. An interesting point is that meantone neutralizes the<br/>distinction between the 9:8 and 10:9 (so that neither can be very<br/>closely approximated), while 22-tET does the same with the 9:8 and<br/>8:7.</p><p>&gt; 22-equal would be a lot worse if you included 9:8.  It happens that<br/>&gt; the 9-limit intervals it&apos;s good at tend to be the ones that are<br/>&gt; important here.  And it also has good 5-limit intervals.</p><p>From my point of view, I might say that 22-tET is not especially<br/>accurate with the basic &quot;Pythagorean&quot; intervals: 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8,<br/>which along with the 2:1 octave are the ones attributed to Pythagoras<br/>(all included in a &quot;quadrichord&quot; with strings of 6:8:9:12). This is<br/>the price of a regular tuning approximating &quot;1/4-septimal-comma&quot;<br/>temperament of the fifth, with 9:8 and 8:7 mapped to the same interval<br/>of 4/22 octave.</p><p>Fortunately, as Paul Erlich and I agree, 22-tET does have acceptable<br/>approximations of sonorities such as 6:8:9 or 4:6:9, quite important<br/>in neo-Gothic -- curiously, in the right timbre, I can also hear such<br/>approximations in 20-tET (0-480-960 cents for 9:12:16), where the<br/>&quot;minor seventh&quot; is actually smaller than a 7:4!</p><p>&gt; Eb4  E4<br/>&gt; Bb3  B3<br/>&gt; F#3  E3</p><p>&gt; The left-hand chord is the alternative version of Eb minor.  So with<br/>&gt; a schismic tuning it would approximate 12:15:20.</p><p>A theorist in the 18th-19th century tradition might call the first<br/>sonority &quot;Eb minor,&quot; but I&apos;d call it, in a neo-Gothic setting, a<br/>&quot;meantone version of the major sixth sonority F#3-A#3-D#4,&quot; with the<br/>major third inviting expansion to a fifth and the major sixth to an<br/>octave, as happens here. From a medieval perspective, the lowest note<br/>is the _fundamentum_ or &quot;foundation&quot; of this sonority. Here the usual<br/>Pythagorean-style spelling with sharps indicates an expectation of<br/>_upward_ semitonal motion in the resolution -- A#3-B3 and D#4-E4.</p><p>As you remark, this would indeed be a close approximation of a<br/>12:15:20 in a Pythagorean or similar setting, and is exactly the kind<br/>of sonority often featured in early 15th-century keyboard pieces,</p><p>Typically such sonorities occur &quot;implicitly&quot; despite usual spellings,<br/>because a popular 12-note tuning of the time (say 1400-1450) is Gb-B,<br/>with the sharps tuned as Pythagorean flats. Thus we get</p><p>  F#4 G4         Gb4 G4<br/>  C#4 D4         Db4 D4<br/>  A3  G3         A3  G3</p><p> written      often sounded</p><p>The second version has a major sixth sonority on A3 very close to<br/>12:15:20, just as you describe.</p><p>&gt; The roles are reversed because 5-limit becomes 9-limit -- the<br/>&gt; alternative minor chord in meantone approximates 6:7:9.  Or 7:9:12<br/>&gt; in this voicing, which doesn&apos;t look like the optimum meantone one as<br/>&gt; it exposes the 7:9.</p><p>Generally I&apos;d say that the exposed 9:7 of 7:9:12 is quite in keeping<br/>with a neo-Gothic style, at a cadence anyway, where that major third<br/>&quot;strives to expand&quot; to the fifth; so the extra tension of a 427-cent<br/>as opposed to pure 9:7 tuning isn&apos;t really a problem, although a pure<br/>7:9:12 does have its own allure. More generally, that major third<br/>could be anything from Pythagorean to 9:7 in a typical neo-Gothic<br/>style.</p><p>Your observation also raises a noteworthy point: different<br/>arrangements like 6:7:9 or 7:9:12 are not precisely &quot;equivalent,&quot;<br/>although in some theories they are inversions of each other. From a<br/>14th-century or neo-14th-century viewpoint, both the major third and<br/>major sixth are &quot;expansive&quot; intervals seeking the fifth and octave<br/>respectively, while 6:7:9 with its &quot;contractive&quot; 7:6 minor third<br/>seeking the unison has somewhat different qualities.</p><p>&gt; This is a different role reversal to the usual one where Pythagorean<br/>&gt; intervals become 5-limit, and so cleaner than the 9-limit intervals<br/>&gt; that stay the same.</p><p>May I ask for a clarification on the last part of this sentence &quot;and<br/>so cleaner than the 9-limit intervals that stay the same&quot;?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Also, as we see in this cadence, the meantone chromatic semitone,<br/>&gt;&gt; the _smaller_ semitone of this tuning at around 76.05 cents,<br/>&gt;&gt; becomes our neo-Gothic diatonic semitone: here Bb3-B3 and Eb4-E4 in<br/>&gt;&gt; the two upper voices.</p><p>&gt; That removes the melodic deficiency of meantone: that the semitones<br/>&gt; are too large.  If you play with 9-limit chords, you can get those<br/>&gt; chromatic semitones to come out.</p><p>Curiously, while my &quot;respelling&quot; has this effect for neo-Gothic,<br/>Vicentino also seems to lean toward cadences with his &quot;enharmonic&quot; or<br/>fifthtone system where the usual meantone thirds and sixths are<br/>maintained vertically, but the large diatonic semitone becomes a small<br/>chromatic semitone. Maybe Paul Erlich or John deLaubenfels might<br/>consider this a 16th-century variation on the &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; theme<br/>(Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI system is a different thing), and it could<br/>also tie in with your point that a leading tone now and then of 21:20<br/>or the like (~84.47 cents, maybe not so far from the 76-cent semitone<br/>of 1/4-comma meantone) could do typical 18th-19th century harmony &quot;a<br/>world of good.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; C#4 B3<br/>&gt;&gt; Bb3 B3<br/>&gt;&gt; Eb3 E3</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s a 4:6:7 chord.  The schismic equivalent would be 10:15:18.<br/>&gt; In this case, the meantone approximation makes a lot more sense.</p><p>Yes, in neo-Gothic terms, the minor seventh seeks a &quot;closest approach&quot;<br/>to the fifth, so the narrower it is, the more efficiently it can<br/>contract to its cadential goal -- and likewise the 7:6 minor third in<br/>relation to its goal of the unison. At the same time, it&apos;s not only<br/>more efficient but more &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;mellow,&quot; so to speak.</p><p>In contrast, a minor seventh at or near 9:5 (e.g. a Pythagorean<br/>augmented sixth, to continue our &quot;role reversal&quot; theme) seems to me<br/>often more tense than either a 16:9 or a 7:4, although the 1020-cent<br/>interval of 20-tET is quite fine, and provides a bit of &quot;modal color&quot;<br/>in contrast to the 960-cent interval (in effect a sub-7:4 which also<br/>serves as a 16:9).</p><p>&gt; Yes, it happens that the same notation or fingering will work for<br/>&gt; either system.  The 9-limit intervals from schismic are still<br/>&gt; 9-limit, the Pythagorean intervals become 5-limit, and the 5-limit<br/>&gt; schismic intervals become 9-limit.  So the logic is the same, but<br/>&gt; the sound is different.</p><p>Here I wonder to what degree the keyboard arrangement itself has a<br/>certain psychological effect on me: the neo-Gothic intervals are<br/>&quot;usual&quot; in a typical neo-Gothic tuning, and the regular meantone or<br/>5-limit ones in a meantone tuning. You nicely sum up the musical<br/>symmetry.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=18410 href="#18410">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Also, in this case the &quot;fifthtones&quot; could<br/>be quartertones in 24-equal.</p><p>&gt; Also, there are usual 16th-century progressions with altered<br/>&gt; intervals, e.g.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G*4  A4               D5  C#*5<br/>&gt; D*4  F4               G4  A*4<br/>&gt; B*3  C4               D4  E*4<br/>&gt; G*3  F3       or      Bb3 A*3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here we have the usual vertical meantone intervals (approximating<br/>the<br/>&gt; ideal of 5-limit JI), but the altered melodic step of a minor<br/>semitone<br/>&gt; B*3-C4 in the second-to-lowest voice of the first example, or<br/>D5-C#*5<br/>&gt; and Bb3-A3 in the outer voices of the second example, normally the<br/>&gt; chromatic semitone (~76.05 cents in 1/4-comma). This is a semitone<br/>of<br/>&gt; about 2/5-tone rather than the usual 3/5-tone (~117.1 cents in<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma).</p><p>And that doesn&apos;t show anything progressing by a fifthtone.</p><p>&gt; Also, in these progressions, we have motions by a large whole-tone<br/>of<br/>&gt; about 6/5-tone or ~234.2 cents in 1/4-comma, e.g. G*3-F3 or D4-E*4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While Vicentino speaks of a diesis as a fifth of a tone, in<br/>1/4-comma<br/>&gt; this is an approximate model, since we actually get two slightly<br/>&gt; unequal fifthtone steps within a chromatic semitone, e.g. C-C*-C#,<br/>&gt; roughly 41.06 cents (the 128:125 diesis) and 34.99 cents (the<br/>&gt; chromatic semitone less this diesis, a difference which it happens<br/>is<br/>&gt; very close to 50:49). This is close enough that counting fifthtones<br/>is<br/>&gt; a very practical guide to the intervals, making a 31-note tuning in<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma a circulating system despite the slight theoretical<br/>&gt; asymmetry.</p><p>As the middle chord is a neutral triad, that would suggest an equal<br/>tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So that&apos;s conceptual simplicity on the 2-keyboard setup.  You&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; simplifying meantone in that context to make it structurally<br/>&gt; &gt; identical to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [I&apos;m not sure if there might be missing text here -- Margo]</p><p>Oh, I probably went to answer another question while I was thinking of<br/>a word for &quot;the same setup with positive temperament&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A 19-note tuning would really need a 19-note keyboard.  If you had<br/>&gt; &gt; such a keyboard, the tuning would be very simple.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True, and such a keyboard, unlike my 24-note version, has a firm<br/>&gt; historical basis. Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo (1555) could be described<br/>&gt; as two 19-note manuals with the usual split keys, with E# and B#<br/>keys<br/>&gt; on the lower manual of his practical 36-note version, or on both<br/>&gt; manuals in his ideal 38-note version (which ran into technical<br/>&gt; problems).</p><p>How do you pronounce &quot;archicembalo&quot;?</p><p>&gt; Costeley (1570) describes a similar 19-note keyboard for 19-tET, and<br/>&gt; 19-note keyboards or _cembali chromatici_ (&quot;chromatic harpsichords)<br/>&gt; had some vogue in Naples around 1600, the environment of the famed<br/>&gt; composer Gesualdo, where keyboard composers such as Trabaci wrote<br/>&gt; pieces especially for this instrument.</p><p>So do any Gesualdo pieces use the extended gamut?  I&apos;m interested in<br/>finding examples of how the extra notes were used.</p><p>&gt; Incidentally, in neo-Gothic terms, both 9:7 and 7:6 are &quot;7-flavor,&quot;<br/>&gt; because they are based on factors of 7; it may be natural in this<br/>&gt; setting to group them together, because they or their octave<br/>&gt; complements typically arise in a division of the fifth (6:7:9 or<br/>&gt; 14:18:21) or major sixth (7:9:12) where one implies the other.</p><p>And, in response to Paul Erlich&apos;s suggestion, they aren&apos;t both<br/>&quot;intervals of 9&quot; or &quot;intervals of 7&quot;, being one of each.  I find that<br/>terminology&apos;s rarely useful in this context.  I describe 6:7:9,<br/>14:18:21 and inversions as &quot;9-limit triads&quot; although there are plenty<br/>of other triads in the 9-limit.  Calling them &quot;intervals of 9 triads&quot;<br/>wouldn&apos;t even be correct, as only 1 of the 3 constituent intervals is<br/>an interval of 9.  (Not that you can have a chord with only intervals<br/>of 9.)</p><p>&gt; However, in a music where a 7-limit sonority such as 4:5:6:7 is<br/>&gt; common, the contrast between &quot;7-limit&quot; and &quot;9-limit&quot; makes great<br/>&gt; sense.</p><p>In chords that use a tritone, I&apos;d call 7-limit tuning the usual, or<br/>&quot;unflavored&quot; version.  The line would then be drawn between 11-limit<br/>chords on the one hand, and the 7-limit subset on the other.  In which<br/>case 4:5:6:7 is the unflavored 7 chord, and 1/(5:6:7:9) the 9-flavor<br/>one.  There&apos;s also the extended 5-limit tuning, which could be called<br/>&quot;completely flavorless&quot;.  Or maybe that would itself constitute a<br/>flavoring.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Another one I hadn&apos;t considered.  I wonder how it&apos;d work with each<br/>&gt; &gt; manual tuned to a traditional well temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 24 notes, there could be interesting possibilities here that I<br/>&gt; hadn&apos;t considered. Once, for fun, I proposed the idea of a<br/>&gt; Vallotti-Young with the diatonic and chromatic fifths reversed to<br/>make<br/>&gt; the most commonly used thirds near-Pythagorean. Since then, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; concluded that a 17-note well-temperament (with 17-tET as a point of<br/>&gt; departure) may be typical for neo-Gothic -- but the idea of applying<br/>&gt; the 24-note concept to 12-note well-temperaments is a whole new<br/>&gt; question.</p><p>You can displace Valotti-Young by a tritone to make the white notes<br/>Pythagorean.  Or you can leave it as it is, and play on the black<br/>notes.  I don&apos;t know how well temperament would fit 17 notes, because<br/>it&apos;s an extreme rather than a compromise temperament.  I haven&apos;t seen<br/>a good well temperament for 19-equal for the same reason, or maybe<br/>because I haven&apos;t been paying attention.</p><p>&gt; One fine point: in a neo-Gothic setting, I&apos;d tend to associate 9:8<br/>&gt; with a &quot;3-limit,&quot; so to speak, since it&apos;s defined as the &quot;difference<br/>&gt; of the consonances&quot; between a 3:2 fifth and a 4:3 fourth; it&apos;s<br/>present<br/>&gt; or approximated a 12-note Pythagorean or near-Pythagorean tuning,<br/>&gt; while something like 9:7 involves ratios of 7 (the &quot;7-flavor&quot;), not<br/>&gt; present in a basic 12-note Pythagorean scheme.</p><p>Whatever it&apos;s called, if it&apos;s being used as a consonance, it has to be<br/>on the charts.</p><p>&gt; However, each setting has its own logical associations and groupings<br/>&gt; of intervals. An interesting point is that meantone neutralizes the<br/>&gt; distinction between the 9:8 and 10:9 (so that neither can be very<br/>&gt; closely approximated), while 22-tET does the same with the 9:8 and<br/>&gt; 8:7.</p><p>Not so much that neither can be closely approximated, but they can&apos;t<br/>both be so approximated at the same time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Eb4  E4<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb3  B3<br/>&gt; &gt; F#3  E3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The left-hand chord is the alternative version of Eb minor.  So<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; a schismic tuning it would approximate 12:15:20.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A theorist in the 18th-19th century tradition might call the first<br/>&gt; sonority &quot;Eb minor,&quot; but I&apos;d call it, in a neo-Gothic setting, a<br/>&gt; &quot;meantone version of the major sixth sonority F#3-A#3-D#4,&quot; with the<br/>&gt; major third inviting expansion to a fifth and the major sixth to an<br/>&gt; octave, as happens here. From a medieval perspective, the lowest<br/>note<br/>&gt; is the _fundamentum_ or &quot;foundation&quot; of this sonority. Here the<br/>usual<br/>&gt; Pythagorean-style spelling with sharps indicates an expectation of<br/>&gt; _upward_ semitonal motion in the resolution -- A#3-B3 and D#4-E4.</p><p>Ah, so in modern notation that would be called &quot;F# 6 no5&quot;.</p><p>Actually, that&apos;s the same kind of the idea as the Neapolitan sixth,<br/>where the third is in the base, which is also the fourth of the key.<br/>So although it&apos;s always described as a bII chord, because that&apos;s<br/>simplest, it still looks a bit like a 6th chord on IV.  All of which<br/>ties in with my thesis that chromatic roots are compositionally<br/>irrelevant in Common Practice music ;)</p><p>&gt; As you remark, this would indeed be a close approximation of a<br/>&gt; 12:15:20 in a Pythagorean or similar setting, and is exactly the<br/>kind<br/>&gt; of sonority often featured in early 15th-century keyboard pieces,</p><p>Do you have any examples of such pieces?  Are the schismic 5-limit<br/>chords used as the rule or the exception?</p><p>&gt; Typically such sonorities occur &quot;implicitly&quot; despite usual<br/>spellings,<br/>&gt; because a popular 12-note tuning of the time (say 1400-1450) is<br/>Gb-B,<br/>&gt; with the sharps tuned as Pythagorean flats. Thus we get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   F#4 G4         Gb4 G4<br/>&gt;   C#4 D4         Db4 D4<br/>&gt;   A3  G3         A3  G3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  written      often sounded<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second version has a major sixth sonority on A3 very close to<br/>&gt; 12:15:20, just as you describe.</p><p>That also relates to the Neapolitan 6th.  In C major, it&apos;d be written<br/>as F-Ab-Db.  But in an Eb-G# meantone, it&apos;d sound as F-G#-C#, which is<br/>a 9-limit major triad.  It also means that C# and G# are chromatic<br/>semitones from C and G, which may have melodic advantages.  So I<br/>wonder how often the cadence would have been heard &quot;wrongly&quot; in this<br/>way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The roles are reversed because 5-limit becomes 9-limit -- the<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative minor chord in meantone approximates 6:7:9.  Or 7:9:12<br/>&gt; &gt; in this voicing, which doesn&apos;t look like the optimum meantone one<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; it exposes the 7:9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generally I&apos;d say that the exposed 9:7 of 7:9:12 is quite in keeping<br/>&gt; with a neo-Gothic style, at a cadence anyway, where that major third<br/>&gt; &quot;strives to expand&quot; to the fifth; so the extra tension of a 427-cent<br/>&gt; as opposed to pure 9:7 tuning isn&apos;t really a problem, although a<br/>pure<br/>&gt; 7:9:12 does have its own allure. More generally, that major third<br/>&gt; could be anything from Pythagorean to 9:7 in a typical neo-Gothic<br/>&gt; style.</p><p>Hmm, well.  The existence of 9-limit harmony when you&apos;re expecting<br/>5-limit harmony should be powerful enough without the chords going out<br/>of tune as well.  Indeed, the more poorly tuned the 9-limit chord is,<br/>the less likely it is to be recognized as such, rendering it<br/>arbitrary.  As the 9:7 is poorly tuned around 31-equal, I&apos;d avoid<br/>placing it at the bottom of the chord, as I find intervals there have<br/>a strong influence on the overall consonance.  So the prevalence of<br/>7:9:12 chords would count against a 31-like meantone tuning.</p><p>In general, you can&apos;t tell from the inversion whether or not a minor<br/>triad should be tuned 5-limit or wider 9-limit.  In both cases, the<br/>simplest ratio is root position (either 6:7:9 or 10:12:15).  With<br/>major triads, the 5-limit version is best tuned as 3:4:5.  If you find<br/>the fifth in the bass that would argue for a 5-limit tuning.</p><p>All of which is fine in theory, but if experiment shows 7:9:12 chords<br/>to be no problem here in meantone, so be it.</p><p>&gt; Your observation also raises a noteworthy point: different<br/>&gt; arrangements like 6:7:9 or 7:9:12 are not precisely &quot;equivalent,&quot;<br/>&gt; although in some theories they are inversions of each other. From a<br/>&gt; 14th-century or neo-14th-century viewpoint, both the major third and<br/>&gt; major sixth are &quot;expansive&quot; intervals seeking the fifth and octave<br/>&gt; respectively, while 6:7:9 with its &quot;contractive&quot; 7:6 minor third<br/>&gt; seeking the unison has somewhat different qualities.</p><p>With octave-equivalent harmony, that&apos;d still come to the same thing.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This is a different role reversal to the usual one where<br/>Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals become 5-limit, and so cleaner than the 9-limit<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; that stay the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May I ask for a clarification on the last part of this sentence &quot;and<br/>&gt; so cleaner than the 9-limit intervals that stay the same&quot;?</p><p>9-limit is 9-limit in both systems.  In meantone, the 9-limit<br/>harmonies will be more complex than the usual 5-limit ones.  But in<br/>schismic, the usual intervals are the Pythagorean ones that are more<br/>complex than the 9-limit.  Hence the dynamic of tension/resolution is<br/>reversed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, it happens that the same notation or fingering will work for<br/>&gt; &gt; either system.  The 9-limit intervals from schismic are still<br/>&gt; &gt; 9-limit, the Pythagorean intervals become 5-limit, and the 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; schismic intervals become 9-limit.  So the logic is the same, but<br/>&gt; &gt; the sound is different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I wonder to what degree the keyboard arrangement itself has a<br/>&gt; certain psychological effect on me: the neo-Gothic intervals are<br/>&gt; &quot;usual&quot; in a typical neo-Gothic tuning, and the regular meantone or<br/>&gt; 5-limit ones in a meantone tuning. You nicely sum up the musical<br/>&gt; symmetry.</p><p>I find that the neutral triads in a neutral third MOS tuning also come<br/>to be &quot;usual&quot;.  This may also be for the psychological reason that<br/>they look like consonances, but also because they get used often<br/>enough to become familiar.  Both reasons also apply to Pythagorean<br/>triads.</p><p>                Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18453 href="#18453">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The lowest part moves up by 9/5-tone, a neutral third<br/>C*3-E3, while the next to lowest part moves down by a small whole-tone<br/>of 4/5-tone, C*4-B3.</p><p>Remove the enharmonic inflections from the notes of the first<br/>sonority, and we get a characteristic 16th-century chromatic<br/>progression, but without the special nuances of the enharmonic<br/>version.</p><p>My own pronunciation of _archicembalo_ follows more or less the<br/>Italian, with _ch_ before _e_ (or _i_) as in English _church_.</p><p>Gesualdo&apos;s use of the more remote accidentals in a 19-note Gb-B# range<br/>is discussed in Glenn Watkins, _Gesualdo: The Man and His Music_<br/>(University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, NC, 1973, ISBN<br/>0-8078-1201-3), pp. 194-201, under the heading &quot;Accidentals and<br/>Chromaticism.&quot;</p><p>Interestingly, Gesualdo&apos;s range of accidentals in his madrigals<br/>coincides almost exactly with the Gb-B# gamut of the 19-note _cembalo<br/>chromatico_ or &quot;chromatic harpsichords&quot; popular in his own milieu<br/>around Naples; one madrigal additionally uses Cb.</p><p>Watkins concludes that Gesualdo&apos;s motivation for using the four most<br/>remote sharps (D#, A#, E#, B#) is to obtain the major third of a<br/>sonority, the norm both for a more conclusive ending of a phrase, and<br/>for various cadences calling for a major third or sixth to proceed to<br/>an octave.</p><p>The situation in Vicentino&apos;s known enharmonic compositions -- one<br/>complete secular Latin motet in honor of his patron, plus some<br/>sections and excerpts from madrigals -- may be somewhat different:<br/>these examples can each fit in some 24-note meantone range with two<br/>manuals a diesis apart (Bb-D# plus Bb*-Eb; Ab-C# plus Ab*-Db).</p><p>As noted by the early 17th-century theorist Doni, Gesualdo sometimes<br/>practices a form of modal transposition, for example in a passage<br/>where all sharps might be ignored and the same melodic and vertical<br/>intervals result (i.e. transposition by a chromatic semitone up).</p><p>For a piece in a 31-note tuning with cadences following a circle of<br/>fifths and visiting all 31 steps in turn, we must wait until Fabio<br/>Colonna&apos;s treatise on his _Sambuca Lincea_ of 1618, which includes an<br/>&quot;Example of Circulation&quot; to demonstrate the division of the whole-tone<br/>into five parts without any complications such as commas which would<br/>impede such a journey.</p><p>It may be a moot point whether a hypothetical xenharmonic researcher<br/>with a frequency counter would find Colonna&apos;s instrument in 1618 tuned<br/>to something more closely resembling 1/4-comma meantone or 31-note<br/>equal temperament (31-tET), and the variances in a tuning by ear could<br/>likely overshadow the theoretical difference between these models.</p><p>Both Vicentino and Colonna tell us that the first 12 or 19 notes of<br/>their instruments are tuned in the common manner, making 1/4-comma a<br/>more likely scenario than 31-tET, and that a whole-tone is divided<br/>into five equal parts, a model literally realized in 31-tET. Late<br/>17th-century theory (Rossi, Huygens) draws a mathematical distinction<br/>between these two slightly different models -- but it is interesting<br/>to ask whether such a line would have been drawn in 1555 or 1618.</p><p>In a 1/4-comma meantone tuning of from 24 to 31 notes, some of the<br/>more remote intervals have two versions differing in size by about<br/>6.07 cents, the &quot;comma&quot; by which 31 such meantone fifths fall short of<br/>18 pure octaves. For example, in my 24-note tuning with the two<br/>keyboards a diesis of 128:125 (~41.06 cents) apart, the neutral third<br/>C*-E is about 345 cents (C-E less C-C*), while C-Eb* is about 351<br/>cents (C-Eb plus Eb-Eb*).</p><p>As you suggest in a recent post, Graham, a 31-tET tuning would<br/>actually give a more accurate approximation of 11:9 than either of<br/>these 1/4-comma sizes: 9/31 octave or ~348.39 cents, within one cent<br/>of the pure interval at ~347.41 cents.</p><p>Anyway, I hope that these remarks may give a bit more information<br/>about Gesualdo&apos;s use of remote accidentals and some of the other<br/>meantone-related topics of this thread.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=18789 href="#18789">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/15/2001 2:21:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote on the 10th:</p><p>&gt; First of all, while I tend to use the term &quot;fifthtone progression&quot; in<br/>&gt; a 16th-century or similar meantone setting to mean various types of<br/>&gt; altered progressions in the &quot;enharmonic&quot; manner involving a shift by a<br/>&gt; diesis or fifthtone in the usual destination, maybe an example of a<br/>&gt; direct fifthtone progression involving motion by several voices might<br/>&gt; be helpful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the notation is like Vicentino&apos;s, his dot above a note to show<br/>&gt; its raising by a diesis being represented by an ASCII asterisk (*):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G*4 G#4<br/>&gt; E*4 E4<br/>&gt; C*4 B3<br/>&gt; C*3 E3</p><p>This looks mighty strange, so I had to find out what it sounds like.

Gb-B# is an equal number of fifths either side of A,<br/>which may be important as A=440Hz is our reference pitch, and similar<br/>ideas may have been around earlier.</p><p>&gt; Watkins concludes that Gesualdo&apos;s motivation for using the four most<br/>&gt; remote sharps (D#, A#, E#, B#) is to obtain the major third of a<br/>&gt; sonority, the norm both for a more conclusive ending of a phrase, and<br/>&gt; for various cadences calling for a major third or sixth to proceed to<br/>&gt; an octave.</p><p>That&apos;s disappointing.  No playing with the 9-limit, then.</p><p>&gt; As noted by the early 17th-century theorist Doni, Gesualdo sometimes<br/>&gt; practices a form of modal transposition, for example in a passage<br/>&gt; where all sharps might be ignored and the same melodic and vertical<br/>&gt; intervals result (i.e. transposition by a chromatic semitone up).</p><p>That&apos;s simple enough.</p><p>&gt; It may be a moot point whether a hypothetical xenharmonic researcher<br/>&gt; with a frequency counter would find Colonna&apos;s instrument in 1618 tuned<br/>&gt; to something more closely resembling 1/4-comma meantone or 31-note<br/>&gt; equal temperament (31-tET), and the variances in a tuning by ear could<br/>&gt; likely overshadow the theoretical difference between these models.</p><p>Oh yes, the two are practically equivalent.  I treat my guitar as a subset<br/>of 31-equal, but I actually fretted it even further away then 1/4-comma.<br/>Some 11-limit intervals are a bit further out, but they still work.</p><p>&gt; Both Vicentino and Colonna tell us that the first 12 or 19 notes of<br/>&gt; their instruments are tuned in the common manner, making 1/4-comma a<br/>&gt; more likely scenario than 31-tET, and that a whole-tone is divided<br/>&gt; into five equal parts, a model literally realized in 31-tET. Late<br/>&gt; 17th-century theory (Rossi, Huygens) draws a mathematical distinction<br/>&gt; between these two slightly different models -- but it is interesting<br/>&gt; to ask whether such a line would have been drawn in 1555 or 1618.</p><p>It would likely have been easier to tune with pure thirds.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18790 href="#18790">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
