So when I<br/>found a diminished 5th b-f&apos; (or rather two of them, g#-d&apos; being tuned<br/>in parallel, with g#-b and d-f both pure 6/5) that was quite a lot<br/>narrower than 7-10, but still sounded non-beating and could be tuned<br/>just by ear, I wondered for some time what it could have been.</p><p>I started from d and tuned f# pure: then it was clear by playing<br/>around with c#, that g# was actually somewhat sharper even than 45/64.<br/>By splitting the difference into two tempered fourths I could estimate<br/>that g#-d was about 604-605 cents. Then by surveying possible dim5&apos;s<br/>with possibly audible coincident upper partials I found 17/12 at 603<br/>cents.</p><p>This made a lot of sense to me, as the interval sounded suspiciously<br/>&apos;normal&apos;. By retuning b up to 7/10 below f&apos; I could create a<br/>diminished chord g#-b-d&apos; extremely close to ET (1 - 119/100 - 17/12).<br/>The giveaway was the sound of g#-b-f&apos; when b was put back to 6/5 above<br/>g#. I had initially noticed this had an unusual ringing to it, which<br/>then made sense as the result of periodicity in 10-12-17.</p><p>Why the tritone f-b sounded (to me) rather less consonant than the<br/>dim5 b-f&apos; might be explained by the fact that 24/17 goes quite a bit<br/>higher in the harmonic series than 17/12.</p><p>Sceptical or interested parties are invited to listen in:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/sphaerenklang/sweet_17.mp3">launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/sphaerenklang/sweet_17.mp3</a></p><p>One answer I could give to Paul&apos;s ironic lament that he no longer<br/>recognizes ET intervals: Just think of it as 17-limit!<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=75237 href="#75237">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2008 11:47:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Tom Dent wrote:</p><p>&gt; Then by surveying possible dim5&apos;s with<br/>&gt; possibly audible coincident upper partials I found 17/12 at<br/>&gt; 603 cents.</p><p>It&apos;s an interesting point. The difference tone has a relative frequency of 5 and the nearest surrounding difference tone is 7. If one can pick up these by ear, then it&apos;s possible to tune the interval nicely by listening for the synchronicity regarding the common fundamental of 1. Another similarity is the minor third of 19:16 which has a difference tone of 3.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
