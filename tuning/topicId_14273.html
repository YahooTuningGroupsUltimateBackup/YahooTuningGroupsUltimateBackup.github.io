The large one is slightly higher than the<br/>12tet &quot;7/4&quot; and the smaller is lower than the 7/4. The smaller one is closer to 7/4 on the flat side than<br/>the larger is on the sharp side. I really like the small approximation, and at least on piece on my new<br/>album will feature it prominently.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
