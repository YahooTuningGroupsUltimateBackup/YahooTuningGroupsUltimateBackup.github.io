That becomes even a brain-dead operation for simple diatonic<br/>tunes. The funny thing is that the melodic lines become exactly inverted in<br/>this process. If you invert the melody again, of course the harmonic<br/>relationships are converted from otonal to utonal and vice-versa.<br/>I uploaded some midi files to the egroup site to illustrate the process with<br/>Pachelbel&apos;s canon. I was planning to redo these with decent MP3&apos;s to have<br/>better control over the spectral properties, but I have to take advantage of<br/>the group&apos;s interest in one of my favorite subjects.</p><p>Kees</p><p><a href="http://www.kees.cc">http://www.kees.cc</a></p></div>
