I am<br/>currently organising a forum for people in Australia [mostly Sydney]<br/>focusing on Just Intonation and microtonal music. They will be monthly<br/>meetings where people interested in non 12tet tunings can discuss ideas<br/>share music, make instruments &amp; software, perform pieces and formulate and<br/>better understand theoretical ideas on tuning.</p><p>As for your thesis Just intonation and posssibly some form of adaptive JI<br/>would be the most pure sounding for instruments with harmonic overtones<br/>[violins, winds, brass]. The piano has overtones that are slightly<br/>inharmonic  [or stretched away from harmonic ideals] and for that reason<br/>some people [namely Sethares] has suggested that the best way to tune such<br/>an instrument is by matching the inharmonic partials. Here also adaptive<br/>tuning could work as although the partials are not harmonic they are not<br/>evenly spaced like 12tet tuning. Another option is to change the timbre to<br/>match the tuning so with an electronic tone generator you coulg create a<br/>timbre that had evenly spaced partials so that 12tet would sound pure [i.e<br/>not beat]</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p></div><h3><a id=56557 href="#56557">ðŸ”—</a>James Starkey &#x3C;wolakota4us@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2005 7:53:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello and Hau,<br/>My name is James Starkey. Until recently I have been primarily<br/>focused upon painting, drawing and sculpture as a full-time artist.<br/>However, 3 weeks ago I began learning to build 5-hole, pentatonic<br/>Lakota style Native American flutes. I am now taking an unforseen<br/>crash course in tuning. Native flutes have a couple different common<br/>means of tuning: &quot;Traditional TUning&quot; which is tuning where the holes<br/>happen to fall, and &quot;Concert Tuning&quot; which is in keeping with modes<br/>and cents and all that stuff I am now newly delving into.</p><p>I recently ran across the &quot;just intonation&quot; way of tuning. I am<br/>trying to find out how I would tune my E flutes using this theory.<br/>Right now I would tune using my newly purchsed chromatic tuner<br/>thusly: E, G, A, B, D, E. Now, I believe I would still tune this way<br/>but to do so using just intonation some notes would be so many cents<br/>sharp and others so many cents flat?</p><p>Please, can somebody break it down in layman&apos;s terms how I can tune<br/>my flutes using this more natural and healthy way?<br/>Pilamiyayelo,<br/>James Starkey</p></div><h3><a id=81493 href="#81493">ðŸ”—</a>Mario Pizarro &#x3C;piagui@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2009 7:18:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To write this note, first I had to check 294 messages I received during the last two days. It took me about two hours to check many repeated posts sent by tuning members so the suggestion given by Ben Miller / Herman Miller would be the right solution of the problem.</p><p>Months ago some one was interested on getting a 12 tone scale where E should be 5/4 (1.25). In those days I had proposed the three Piagui scales and finally know that they were already presented in Germany some centuries in the past. Recently, Claudio Di Veroli told  me that at the present time it is almost impossible to build a new scale since<br/>almost all the scale modes were already deduced and published. I guess that this information does not include the Just Intonation modes.</p><p>Since the development of a JI scale of twelve tones per octave is something new for me, I thought that one of the first numbers, in this case number 16, could give the solution if this number is expanded like the Fourier series, which implies a process of sum. The following details might have been exposed by some tuning members in the past, despite that, I will explain the way I got a self constructing JI scale.</p><p>Guessing that numbers 2, 4, 8, 16.....are wavelenghts (m) then their inversions (1/N) are  frequencies (Hz). Please disregard the fact that actually the light velocity is the constant that controls the product: wave length by frequency so the extremely low frequencies used in the series are not real values. From frequency (0.25) the constant ( 0.0625) was omited. By taking the theoretical frequency of (1/16) = 0.0625 Hz as the constant addend to expand the series, we get:</p><p>0.0625 + [(0.0625)] = (0.125) + [(0.0625)] = (0.1875) + [(0.0625] = (0.25) + 0.3125 +</p><p>0.375 + 0.4375 + 0.5 + 0.5625 + 0.625 + 0.6875 + 0.75 + 0.8125 + 0.875 + 0.9375 + 1</p><p>+ 1.0625 + 1.125 + 1.1875 + 1.25 + 1.3125 + 1.375 + 1.4375 + 1.5 + 1.5625 + 1.625 +</p><p>1.6875 + 1.75 + 1.8125 + 1.875 + 1.9375 + 2 + 2.0625 + 2.125 + 2.1875 .........</p><p>The red numbers are the heptatonic Just Intonation frequencies while 1.6875, a provisional A, is the pure fifth of 1.125. The middle of 1.375 and 1.4375 gives 1.40625 that could work as a provisional F#. Similarly, 1.78125 could also work as Bb since 1.78125/1.5 gives 1.1875; besides that, the middle of 1.75 and 1.8125 produces the same frequency: 1.78125 Hz while the middle of 1.5625 and 1.625 gives 1.59375 to work as a provisional Ab; since this value is the pure fifth of 1.0625, this frequency could work as a provisional C#.</p><p>The provisional tone frequencies will be modified to get narrow fifths with the proper number of cents. Since these calculations are not finished, next message will contain the full data of the 12 tone Just Intonation scale. The aim of this message is to remark the series process used to determine the first group of JI scale tones.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, February 17, 2009</p></div><h3><a id=90735 href="#90735">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2010 10:44:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I allready know that what I&apos;m about to write will be at first unacceptable<br/>to most people, but I just have to share this.</p><p>As many of you will know I&apos;ve been on a long quest to find how music works<br/>in Just Intonation.<br/>Tried everything I could think of (which has been a lot), and many times<br/>thought I had found it.<br/>Well.. this is one of those times again :)<br/>I think I&apos;ve found it :)<br/>(or atleast the start of it)</p><p>I think (common practice) music works inside 2 chains of pure 3/2 fifths<br/>which run parallel at a 5/4 interval.</p><p>Like this: (subset)<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000  unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        135/128            92.179  major chroma, major limma<br/>  2:       2187/2048          113.685  apotome<br/>  3:         10/9             182.404  minor whole tone<br/>  4:          9/8             203.910  major whole tone<br/>  5:         32/27            294.135  Pythagorean minor third<br/>  6:       1215/1024          296.089  wide augmented second<br/>  7:          5/4             386.314  major third<br/>  8:         81/64            407.820  Pythagorean major third<br/>  9:          4/3             498.045  perfect fourth<br/> 10:      10935/8192          499.999  fourth + schisma, 5-limit<br/>approximation to ET fourth<br/> 11:         45/32            590.224  diatonic tritone<br/> 12:        729/512           611.730  Pythagorean tritone<br/> 13:         40/27            680.449  grave fifth<br/> 14:          3/2             701.955  perfect fifth<br/> 15:        405/256           794.134  wide augmented fifth<br/> 16:          5/3             884.359  major sixth, BP sixth<br/> 17:         27/16            905.865  Pythagorean major sixth<br/> 18:         16/9             996.090  Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 19:       3645/2048          998.044<br/> 20:         15/8            1088.269  classic major seventh<br/> 21:        243/128          1109.775  Pythagorean major seventh<br/> 22:          2/1            1200.000  octave</p><p>Where the &quot;consonant&quot; major triad at root position is: 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>And the &quot;consonant&quot; minor triad at root position is: 1/1 1215/1024 3/2</p><p>There are several other major and minor triads possible (and used), but<br/>these either don&apos;t have root position at the base of the fifth, or they are<br/>less consonant.</p><p>Consonance is not only a function of simplicity of ratios, but in musical<br/>context consonance is mainly a lack of tension to resolve.<br/>A dissonance is a ratio that is not &quot;above&quot; the root (for instance 4/3 is a<br/>dissonance if it is above a 1/1 root)</p><p>For instance with the dominant 7th chord, it is 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9.
