I guess there will be those who<br/>make the music, and those who wank off with the math.<br/>But it&apos;s my firm conviction that all the wanking off<br/>will eventually lead to something concrete.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Questions regarding &quot;Monzo finity&quot;:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) How would we manage to isolate - the values of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; prime numbers which happen to factor the numerators<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and denominators of ratios which describe such ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;slightly different&quot; in frequency from a low-numbered<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervallic ratio (such as 3/2) - from the possibility<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the limits of our perception in resolving small<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; variations in pitch resulting in effects similar to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;bridging&quot; effects proposed?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, I refer you to the harmonic entropy concept.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: So, if &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; is untrue, then so is<br/>&gt; &quot;bridging&quot; (or, at least, not demonstrable as being<br/>&gt; different from a phenomenon related simply to the<br/>&gt; limits of our ability to discern pitch accurately,<br/>&gt; sort of like the finite number of digits in an<br/>&gt; arithmetical calculation)?</p><p> But the &quot;limits of our ability to discern pitch accurately&quot;<br/>is entirely bound up with both the bridging *and* harmonic<br/>entropy concepts.  That&apos;s exactly what they both explore.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Of course, ultimately, my belief is that, whatever the mathematics<br/>&gt; &gt; involved in the actual tuning, our understanding of our *perception*<br/>&gt; &gt; of what we hear is grounded in perception of the lowest few primes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: But I am asking you about *why* you believe what you do<br/>&gt; (about that which is expressible in non-subjective terms).</p><p> Well, the vast amount of reading I&apos;ve done on tuning suggests<br/>to me that there is some type analytical process going on in<br/>the brain when we listen to music.</p><p>The business with the &quot;lowest few primes&quot; is simply that,<br/>in calculation, it&apos;s my belief that it takes a lot less<br/>&quot;brain power&quot; to comprehend numbers that can be factored<br/>into small primes, like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 ... you get the idea.</p><p>I think that somewhere between 13 and 31 or so, this ability<br/>finally breaks down, and any numbers with higher prime-factors<br/>will simply be understood as audibly-equivalent numbers composed<br/>of lower prime-factors.  Of course, these boundaries depend<br/>a lot on the musical context.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So we&apos;re employing xenharmonic bridges all the time when we hear<br/>&gt; &gt; any tuning that&apos;s not alread low-integer RI (&quot;rational intonation&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: How could we proceed in proving this to ourselves and others?</p><p>One example: nearly everyone who hears a 12-EDO &quot;major&quot; triad<br/>will accept it, at least briefly, as a 4:5:6 proportion (again,<br/>this also depends on context).</p><p>A better example: a 16:19:24 JI &quot;minor&quot; triad will almost always<br/>be accepted at first as a 12-EDO &quot;minor&quot; triad.</p><p>A still better example: a 12-EDO &quot;perfect 5th&quot; and a Pythagorean<br/>3:2 dyad will almost always be interpreted as the same thing.</p><p>Xenharmonic bridges happening in all of these.</p><p>&gt; _______________________________________________________<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; JM: In fact, this is exactly what&apos;s at the root of the whole<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; heated debate over how to precisely define &quot;just intonation&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Intervals and larger sound-conglomerates whose frequencies<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; can be compared as low-integer ratios reveal that the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lowest primes (as factors in the ratio terms) clearly have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a distinctive audible affect, which is why they are important<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to tuning theory.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; JG: But, since there are *more* &quot;lowest primes&quot; per linear<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; section of integers which encompass the integer values of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; those &quot;lower primes&quot; than in the case of higher primes,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how do we *know* that it is the *small numerical value*<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; primes which have &quot;more&quot; significance that the *large<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; numerical value* primes?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think I get the gist of what you&apos;re saying here, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; not too clear.  Please elaborate, maybe with some examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: That was not well put.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I added in the following (amending) post:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; JG: I add to the above statement:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does the fact that there *are* &quot;more of them&quot; suffice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is not very well put, either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I am getting at is along the lines of:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; A second question is expressed by the addition of the<br/>&gt; following statement to the text quoted above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How, also, do we determine whether it is the relative<br/>&gt; &quot;density&quot; (per section of integers) of the &quot;smaller<br/>&gt; valued primes&quot; which makes them &quot;special&quot;, OR the<br/>&gt; &quot;smallness of the integers&quot; (which turn out to be<br/>&gt; largely prime integer values in the case of small<br/>&gt; valued integers)? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the same thinking, how do we &quot;know&quot; that it is<br/>&gt; the small-valued primes (and not, instead the large-<br/>&gt; valued primes) which form a &quot;basis&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that - in a system considering sinusoidal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sound source &quot;voices&quot; - the distinction of whether the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *lower* valued primes or the *higher* valued primes hold<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a more significant place would be a hard thing to establish.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, it&apos;s a foundation of my theory that the brain<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;understands&quot; the lowest primes far more easily than higher<br/>&gt; &gt; ones.  This would be primarily because our perception of<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch is multiplicative rather than additive.  The lowest<br/>&gt; &gt; primes, as factors in ratios, form a sort of ultimate<br/>&gt; &gt; reduced basis for our comprehension of harmonic relationships.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: But larger valued primes are, themselves, irreducible,<br/>&gt; are they not?</p><p>Yes, absolutely.  But let&apos;s take this example:</p><p>prime-factor<br/> 2  3 11 31       ratio      ~cents</p><p>-4  0  0  1  =    31/16     1145.035572<br/>-6  0  3  0  =   125/64     1158.941142</p><p>There&apos;s a difference between them of only ~13.90556913<br/>(a bit more than 1/2-comma).</p><p>In a context where these two ratios would be audibly<br/>indistinguishable, a listener will probably perceive<br/>31/16 *as* 125/64, because of the lower prime-factors.</p><p>I have to answer the rest later.
