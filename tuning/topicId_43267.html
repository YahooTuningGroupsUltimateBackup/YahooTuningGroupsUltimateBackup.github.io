I have singled it out for mention here for a couple of reasons. (1) It is NOT a raga in the technical sense -- a raga must have atleast 5 notes, while Mahati has only 4. (2) It comprises the same notes as those in the seventh chord: with C as the Sa, it would be C E G bB. (3) On singing it, I experienced a particularly strong sense of supplication, surrender serenity and strength. (4) In addition, it lends itself especially well for jamming, notably in slow/moderate tempo.</p><p>Raga: Mahati</p><p>Aroha: C E G bB C&apos;<br/>Avaroha: C&apos; bB G E C.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2003 9:15:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 7/4/03 1:55 am, Haresh BAKSHI at <a href="mailto:hareshbakshi@hotmail.com">hareshbakshi@hotmail.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello Alison and all, I have been collecting scales (really the<br/>&gt; raga-s with their notes arranged sequentially), especially such scales which<br/>&gt; go well with prayers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; During this search, I came across the raga Mahati.
