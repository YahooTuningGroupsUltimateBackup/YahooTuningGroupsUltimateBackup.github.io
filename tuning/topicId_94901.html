Several years ago there was an extended discussion of keyboards for pajara on MMM, and Jon Szanto raised the issue that it could be construed to be off-topic (since it didn&apos;t involve any actual music), but he let it go on, because the objective was to build a keyboard that would be used to make microtonal music.</p><p>This list was here before MMM, so just about anything related in any way to alternative tunings is on-topic here, even links to new compositions (normally found on MMM).  The exception would be threads involving higher maths, for which tuning-math was specifically created, so as not to put off folks who don&apos;t appreciate that sort of discussion.</p><p>--George</p></div>
