To me the<br/>&gt; most interesting thing about the Wilson fifth is that it gives a<br/>&gt; meantone brat of -1; however Wilson thought it was important that it<br/>&gt; was the limit of a linear recurrence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He also used a linear recurrence for something called &quot;chopi&quot;, which<br/>&gt; may or may not be more or less the linear temperament I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; calling hexidecimal, with commas 36/35 and 135/128. If so, it seems we<br/>&gt; should call that one &quot;chopi&quot;. He used the characteristic polynomial<br/>&gt; x^4-x-2, which gives<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C[n] = C[n-2] + 2 C[n-4]</p><p> we have meta mavila which is<br/>C[n] = C[n-3] + 2 C[n-4]<br/> which is the one i think you mean?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This polynomial is reducible, equalling (x+1)(x^3-x^2+x-2), so we<br/>&gt; could also use<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C[n] = C[n-1] - C[n-2] + 2 C[n-3]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a cubic rather than a quartic recurrence, and so would seem to<br/>&gt; be preferable. It may be that since if zero coefficients are ignored<br/>&gt; we  have a three-term rather than a four-term recurrence, Wilson<br/>&gt; preferred his version.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve two questions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) What musical value attaches to these linear recurrences? As usual,<br/>&gt; reading Wilson is difficult for me; he seems to think it is important<br/>&gt; but I can&apos;t tell why.</p><p>they are ways of generating scales, that for one, can have every interval unique. this is true of the numerical<br/>series before they converge. also due to the recurrent sequences, the difference tones produced form  tones that<br/>generate the scale itself or many of its members. the original purpose of those  pursuing &apos;gold&apos; and gold like scales<br/>was to find the most disonant scales possible. the thing isis that since they do generate their own scale members.<br/>you end up with another type of consonance. All these scales will contain triads that are equal beating.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) Why did he choose the fourth-order recurrence when he could have<br/>&gt; used a cubic recurrence?</p><p>how would this occur in a musical context? I personally have noticed such patterns  but couldn&apos;t translate them into<br/>sound.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
