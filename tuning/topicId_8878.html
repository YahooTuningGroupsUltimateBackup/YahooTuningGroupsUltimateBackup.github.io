The advantages of a closed system proved strong enough<br/>&gt;to elevate 12-tET to the only tuning our culture has really known for<br/>&gt;150 years. Now that Fokker&apos;s organ, Catler&apos;s guitar, and the advent of<br/>&gt;electronics have proven the practicability of a 31-tone system, we<br/>&gt;have the opportunity to institute an alternative which can both<br/>&gt;redress the damage that has been done to the performance of 16th-18th<br/>&gt;century music, and open the floodgates for future possibilities<br/>&gt;involving 7-11-limit harmonies, Arabian scales, microtonal effects,<br/>&gt;etc. etc. The difference, to my ears, between any of the &quot;optimal&quot;<br/>&gt;meantone temperaments and 31-tET in the historical repertoire is<br/>&gt;negligible.</p><p>It&apos;s terrific to think of 31t-ET, a &quot;circulating&quot; or modulating 1/4 comma<br/>meantone system, as conceivably &quot;supplanting&quot; 12t-ET as a &quot;de facto&quot; system<br/>for both past and future musics,  but is it practical to perform historical<br/>repertoire on 31-tET keyboards?</p><p>Does this involve some kind of &quot;mapping&quot; of pitches where only *some* of<br/>the 31 pitches are &quot;mapped&quot; onto a 12-note keyboard??...  That doesn&apos;t make<br/>sense, though, since the &quot;normal&quot; 1/4 comma meantone system would already<br/>do that... (??)</p><p>If the keyboards are very different from 12 notes per octave, doesn&apos;t that<br/>jeopardize the frequency of performances... or am I getting this all wrong<br/>(??)</p><p>Certainly people are not being asked to perform traditional composers like<br/>Handel on a keyboard with 31 keys... or *ARE* they??  I would expect<br/>resistance to such a proposal.</p><p>Signed,</p><p>&quot;Confused&quot;</p><p>_______________ ________ ______ ____ __ _ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson<br/>]</p></div>
