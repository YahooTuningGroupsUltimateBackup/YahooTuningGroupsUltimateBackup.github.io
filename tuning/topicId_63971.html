Hardware synths are all about<br/>the same these days at the manufacturer level, with the<br/>possible exception of Kurzweil (though they&apos;re sort of just<br/>coming back from the dead at the moment).  No synth offers<br/>what I&apos;d call flexible tuning control.  Virtually all Roland<br/>instruments support arbitrary 12-tone tunings.</p><p><a href="http://Microtonal-synthesis.com">Microtonal-synthesis.com</a> is a great (and the only) resource<br/>for this stuff, but its grid doesn&apos;t capture the important<br/>nuances of tuning capabilities/limitations, and sometimes the<br/>information there is just wrong (obtaining it from<br/>manufacturers is nearly impossible; manuals often don&apos;t<br/>mention it; often the only way to find out is to test the<br/>instrument in person, which, with the demise of showrooms,<br/>is nearly impossible).  And it only lists a minority of<br/>available instruments.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
