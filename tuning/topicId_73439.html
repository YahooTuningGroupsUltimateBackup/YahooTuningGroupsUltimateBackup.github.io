I&apos;ve spent years<br/>researching microtonal music-theory, and sharing as<br/>much of it as i can with the world, and it really<br/>irks me that *one person* could just completely<br/>obliterate any mention of me from a web resource<br/>which gets a lot of use, and to whose users my<br/>webpages could provide a *lot* more information.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
