The conflict<br/>lies perhaps between 5/4 and 81/64, but perhaps only through fifths. None<br/>yet could say they&apos;ve heard the 81st harmonic, it&apos;s just too weak. You can<br/>sound the tone where it would be, brought down several octaves. For example<br/>C at 128Hz approx. makes the pythagorean E at a whopping 10368Hz, whereas<br/>the 5/4 occurs at 640. Makes 12ET a kind of pythagorean meantone, like<br/>everyone knows and hates.</p><p>2. The ear likes to make the major third brighter. Same goes for minor<br/>third: some trans-Danubian minor thirds get really close to major ones, or a<br/>re best seen as neutral thirds. Russian/Czech/Hungarian/Romanian folk music<br/>uses this kind of third very often.</p><p>3. Piano inharmonicity causes all sorts of effects, but the ear likes things<br/>sharp. Classic acoustic test: two lines *exactly* a 4/1 or 5/1 apart sounds<br/>wrong, the upper line sounds flat. Stretch the octave a bit, and hey presto,<br/>things are in tume again. The difference is very small, of the order of a<br/>schizma or less, at four octaves or five. At six or seven 2/1s, the ear can<br/>get confused very easily, and even sevenths or 9ths can sound in tune. This<br/>of course is due to partials occuring in the same area. are you plaing in<br/>2/1s or are you playing in 9/8 or 15/16 or closer ratios. By definition, a<br/>just &apos;otonal&apos; ratio will, if played with its fundamental will sound<br/>consonant. Lowering it into closer position will result in dissonance<br/>through clashing overtones. Then comes that question: if 2/1s are stretched,<br/>won&apos;t the others be also?</p><p>The answer is yes. So where precisely and at what actual ratio of<br/>frequencies is the harmonic series? Physics and physiology are at odds. You<br/>can do sums forever, but will it sound like you worked it out to be?</p><p>But hey, teach your grandmother to suck eggs as they say; I suspect you knew<br/>all this anyway.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 2:56:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 2.

Lowering it into closer position will result in<br/>dissonance<br/>&gt; through clashing overtones.</p><p>possibly, though several other effects are at play as well. if it<br/>were simply about clashing overtones, how would you explain<br/>octave stretching? i refer you to ernst terhardt&apos;s website for<br/>discussion of many of these issues.</p><p>&gt; Then comes that question: if 2/1s are stretched,<br/>&gt; won&apos;t the others be also?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The answer is yes.</p><p>if you stretch the octaves by a schisma every four or five octaves,<br/>the major third will be stretched by a fraction of a cent. this is a<br/>far cry from the fourteen cent difference between the 5/4 and an<br/>et major third.</p><p>&gt; Physics and physiology are at odds.</p><p>physics should never be never be the end of the story, or even<br/>more than a preface. there is a human nervous system and<br/>mind at work. psychoacoustics is progressing at an<br/>unprecedented rate and one needs to have some sense of what<br/>has been discovered. we are not living in helmholtz&apos;s world<br/>anymore.</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 4:22:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2.
