Process and civility<br/>-----------------------</p><p>From a number of years of experience with certain music groups on<br/>Usenet, I know some danger signs of a situation which can<br/>diminish or even eclipse a group&apos;s usefulness:</p><p>       (a) People post allegations about offlist activity by a<br/>           member not related to the purpose or substance of the<br/>           group. One tactic I&apos;ve seen on Usenet is simply<br/>           pointing out that someone posts to newsgroups somehow<br/>           considered &quot;improper&quot; or &quot;disreputable.&quot; This is an<br/>           excellent way to move a group off-topic and promote<br/>           conflict, rather than the charter or agenda of the<br/>           group.</p><p>       (b) Exchanges focus much more on personal conflicts of a<br/>           very negative emotional quality than on the meeting or<br/>           clarification of ideas.</p><p>Something is very wrong when these things happen. Whatever the<br/>differences, breakthroughs, or even outright mistakes involved,<br/>we need to address them in a more collegial way than this.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>2. Context counts -- &quot;optimal&quot; is relative<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>One thing I have experienced: people, who may be very musically<br/>sophisticated in the styles they are focusing on and<br/>mathematically astute, who make mistaken assumptions about the<br/>styles of others.</p><p>An experience maybe back in the epoch of 2000-2002 may serve as<br/>an example. I was using some kind of system with two 12-note<br/>Pythagorean chains, and was told that with such a tuning, I &quot;had<br/>to&quot; be using &quot;7-limit&quot; harmony, evidently meaning &quot;2-3-5-7&quot; in a<br/>Partchian sense.

But just take a<br/>look at George Secor&apos;s 41-HTT (secor41htt.scl), and we have an<br/>exciting alternative to evaluate, or possibly a not inconsiderable<br/>starting point for creative iterations!</p><p>Well, that&apos;s it, for the moment -- a bit more complicated than<br/>unsubscribing, but also hopefully a bit more constructive,</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2010 9:51:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; An experience maybe back in the epoch of 2000-2002 may serve as<br/>&gt; an example.

Presumably you got that sorted out quickly enough?</p><p>&gt; To evaluate an &quot;optimal&quot; maqam tuning -- possibly quite different<br/>&gt; from a given flavor of Arab practice than for a typical Turkish<br/>&gt; practice, and different again for the Persian dastgah system --<br/>&gt; one had better know these systems very well, or at least be<br/>&gt; prepared to learn, before seeking to judge what is &quot;optimal.&quot;</p><p>Since I introduced the dreaded word &quot;optimal&quot;, I&apos;d better reply. And my reply, briefly, is &quot;no&quot;. You need know nothing about the subject; all you need is that someone who does know about the subject has supplied a list of necessary and sufficient conditions, or at least necessary conditions, in very specific numerical form.</p><p>The most obvious sort of necessary condition to start out with would be a list of intervals like your Jz0, Jz1, and so forth, only precisely defined. If you could say &quot;let C be a set of disjoint closed (alt, open) intervals of real numbers; any tuning system satisfying our desirability condition must contain at least one note in each of these intervals&quot; then you have a necessary condition which would suffice to eliminate, or not, numerous possible candidates. You wouldn&apos;t need to argue if 41 or 72 or 159 or any other edo would work if you could eliminate it off the bat. Moreover, it would be possible to find the smallest edo satisfying the necessary condition, and that could then be examined for suitability by the expert on examining suitability, presumably the one who supplied the necessary conditions in the first place.</p><p>Of course, there will be an element of arbitrariness in choosing C, but that&apos;s just because there is an element of arbitrariness in the whole project which cannot be eliminated. Still, lines can be drawn and in my opinion should be, so that we know what the hell we are talking about.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2010 10:18:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>Much thanks again in trying to establish a healthy dose of &quot;relativism&quot; in tuning and temperament in the case of Maqam music.
