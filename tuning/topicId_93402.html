In the Turkish comma system,<br/>these flavors would be described as 10, 11, 12, or 13 commas<br/>respectively, with all of them seen as involving an &quot;augmented&quot; step<br/>somewhat larger than a usual tone around 9:8 or 9 commas.</p><p>The Lebanese composer and theorist Amine Beyhom seems to adopt a<br/>similar viewpoint when he describes a step in Turkish Hijaz at around<br/>237 or 242 cents in a measured performance by Kudsi Erguner as a<br/>&quot;slightly augmented second.&quot; It is interesting to ask what kinds of<br/>categorical perception may have operated in the world of Safi al-Din<br/>and Qutb al-Din, but the aptness of their tunings for modelling some<br/>patterns of modern Near Eastern performance on flexible-pitch<br/>instruments suggests their continuing relevance in practice as well as<br/>in theory.</p><p>In contrast to our first encounter with Buzurg at Rotation 4 (Part 3<br/>of this series), our &quot;Buzurg redux&quot; here has fewer options for<br/>alternative upper tetrachords, the one choice in evidence being the<br/>lowering of the neutral seventh by a comma from 1061.7 cents (~24/13)<br/>to 1038.3 (~51/28). This nuance, as we shall see, is central to some<br/>possible variations on the Turkish Segah or Ferahnak in this rotation.</p><p>As with our first Buzurg at Rotation 4, here we have available a<br/>convenient modulation to Rast on the 14/13 step of our Buzurg mode, a<br/>Rast featured in our next rotation.

Maqam &grave;Iraq, as a member of the Arab Sikah<br/>family of maqamat, shares the element knitting together this family:<br/>a Sikah trichord above the final consisting of a typically smallish<br/>neutral second plus a tone, thus defining the neutral third of this<br/>trichord. The following diagram shows Arab note names:</p><p>                           &quot;Bayyati&quot;<br/>          Sikah            (Huseyni)                Rast<br/>     |--------------|-----------------------|----------------.......|<br/>    0.0   126.6   334.0   495.7   622.3   829.7   1038.3  1200.0 1326.6<br/>  ~ 1/1   14/13   40/33    4/3    56/39   21/13    51/28   2/1    28/13<br/>  &grave;iraq    rast   dukah   sikah jaharkah  nawa    huseyni  awj   kirdan<br/>     |----------------------|<br/>             &grave;Iraq</p><p>Maqam &grave;Iraq shares the name of its 1/1 or final, the step &grave;iraq, a<br/>neutral second below the cardinal reference point of rast. The lower<br/>Sikah trichrd, &grave;iraq-rast-dukah, at 0-127-334 cents, is likely<br/>somewhat lower than a typical Arab tuning, possibly something like<br/>1/1-13/12-39/32 or 0-139-342 cents, for example. These steps are the<br/>final, neutral second, and neutral third of &grave;Iraq, and also the<br/>neutral second below, final, and major second of Rast.</p><p>The middle tetrachord takes the general form called &quot;Bayyati&quot; in Arab<br/>theory, with two neutral seconds plus an upper tone to complete the<br/>fourth. However, a typical Arab Bayyati might be something like<br/>1/1-13/12-13/11-4/3 or 13:12-12:11-44:39 (138.6-150.6-208.8 cents). Our actual tetrachord is instead of the Turkish Huseyni type at<br/>0-161.7-288.3-495.7 cents, still fitting the Arab structure in its<br/>most generic sense, but with a characteristically Ottoman shade of<br/>intonation! Either in a usual Arab tuning or this less usual one, this<br/>central tetrachord consists of the steps dukah-sikah-jaharkah-nawa,<br/>the major second, neutral third, fourth, and fifth of Maqam Rast --<br/>or, the neutral third, fourth, augmented fourth or tritone, and<br/>neutral sixth of the step &grave;iraq.</p><p>In theory, the upper jins or genus of &grave;Iraq is often cited as a Rast<br/>trichord nawa-huseyni-awj, the fifth, major sixth, and neutral seventh<br/>of Rast. In terms of our 1/1 at &grave;iraq, these are the neutral sixth,<br/>neutral seventh, and octave, so that this trichord completes a modal<br/>textbook octave for Maqam &grave;Iraq on the 2/1 step, awj.</p><p>In practice, however this Rast trichord, here an Ottoman flavor of<br/>Rast at 0-207.4-370.3 cents or around 1/1-44/39-26/21, tends to<br/>function as a Rast tetrachord completed by the step kirdan at an<br/>octave above rast, and here 127 cents above awj, with awj pulling up<br/>to kirdan. Thus kirdan, a small neutral ninth above the final, serves<br/>as an attractive focus for the ascending sayr of the maqam, which may<br/>then descend back toward &grave;iraq.</p><p>Additionally, some Arab theorists recognize an alternative &grave;Iraq<br/>tetrachord above the final of &grave;Iraq, and taking the name of this<br/>maqam, thus &grave;iraq-rast-dukah-sikah. One might explore this tetrachord,<br/>for example, after ascending to kirdan and then descending back into<br/>the lower fourth above the final.</p><p>It will be noted that Maqam &grave;Iraq has no perfect fifth above the<br/>final; and in some Syrian versions, the fourth step above &grave;iraq may be<br/>at around 21/16 (more precisely, in theory, 21 commas, or about 475<br/>cents in either Pythagorean intonation or 53-EDO). This Syrian<br/>interpretation of &grave;Iraq provides a fine example of how a maqam need<br/>not have either a 4/3 or 3/2, although most have at least one of these<br/>two steps -- not so surprisingly, given the tetrachordal or sometimes<br/>pentachordal focus of much Near Eastern theory and practice.</p><p>We have available also a variant upon Turkish Segah which makes the<br/>most of a subtle comma nuance:</p><p>              Segah             tone         Hijaz-i Buzurg<br/>    |------------------------|.........|-----------------------|<br/>   0.0   126.6   334.0    495.7     703.1   829.7    1061.7  1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1   14/13   40/33     4/3       3/2    21/13     24/13   2/1<br/>  segah chargah  neva     hisar     evdj  gerdaniye   sarp   buzurg<br/>                                                    muhayyer</p><p>The lower tetrachord is a usual Ottoman Segah of the low neutral or<br/>Zalzalian flavor, with a neutral second and third around 14/13 and<br/>40/33. The disjunct upper tetrachord on the 3/2 step differs in having<br/>a central step at a near-just 8:7 rather than the 9:8 or 44:39 of the<br/>lower tetrachord, thus approximately 3/2-21/13-24/13-2/1 or<br/>14:13-8:7-13:12, the classic Buzurg of the 13th century (or, more<br/>accurately, the lower tetrachord of a classic Buzurg pentachord).</p><p>Since, in Turkish practice, this &quot;Buzurg tetrachord&quot; is recognized as<br/>one common form of Hijaz, the overall ascending seyir or melodic path<br/>thus fits the general category of Segah as disjunct Segah-Hijaz,<br/>albeit in a less typical way. Then, the descending seyir might be like<br/>this:</p><p>              Segah             tone            Segah<br/>    |------------------------|.........|-----------------------|<br/>   0.0   126.6   334.0    495.7     703.1   829.7   1038.3   1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1   14/13   40/33     4/3       3/2    21/13    51/28    2/1<br/>  segah chargah  neva     hisar     evdj  gerdaniye muhayyer buzurg</p><p>Here for the descent, we have two disjunct Segah tetrachords.

Thus it might be said that we have transposed<br/>this maqam down by about a 14:13! This approach has the advantage of<br/>keeping a more or less typical Ottoman Rast, and its final rast, as a<br/>point of reference -- the Rast of our next rotation.</p><p>Our approach introduces some less familiar perde or step names such as<br/>Shuri, at a diatonic semitone or limma (here around 22:21 or 81 cents)<br/>above perde rast. While it would be possible to call our 1/1 perde<br/>rast rather than perde arak, this would involve the disadvantage in a<br/>Turkish or Arab context that we would have a step named rast but<br/>unable to support a usual form of Maqam Rast with a largish neutral<br/>third around 16/13 (359 cents) or 26/21 (370 cents), for example, as<br/>opposed to the much lower 334 cents which is here the only neutral<br/>third available. The name of perde arak (or Arab &grave;iraq), in contrast,<br/>creates the expectation of a smallish neutral third, with 334 cents<br/>typical of a certain shade of Ottoman intonation, and something around<br/>39/32 (342 cents) or 11/9 (347 cents) likely more typical of many Arab<br/>styles.</p><p>In more of a Persian context, however, a step named &quot;rast&quot; might well<br/>have only a smallish neutral third above it, since this kind of<br/>structure is typical of Ibn Sina&apos;s mode he calls Mustaqam with a<br/>tetrachord of 1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3 or 0-203.9-342.5-498.0 cents<br/>(9:8-13:12-128:117). This style of step naming would fit a maqam<br/>sharing the lower tetrachord of Nihavend-i Hagar, but placing<br/>considerable emphasis on major sixth and minor seventh steps not in<br/>evidence for this rotation. and called Mustaqim al-Hagar since the<br/>lower tetrachord can be seen as a variation on Ibn Sina&apos;s with the<br/>neutral third somewhat lower, here about 334 cents. The Zalzalian 12<br/>set, unfortunately, does not have the right notes and intervals in the<br/>right places to realize this maqam; but the Ethno Extras series will<br/>include a dedicated 12-note tuning set for Mustaqim al-Hagar.</p><p>               *                 *               *</p><p>This rotation offers a fascinating form of pelog which, however, may<br/>be as closely related to Vietnamese music as to certain currents in<br/>gamelan music.</p><p>A pelog tuning set typically consists of seven notes, out of which can<br/>be formed various five-note modes, as well as some other modes listed<br/>in the Scala file modename.par which may involve four or even all<br/>seven notes of the set.</p><p>My idea began with this five-note mode:</p><p>      0.0    126.6    334.0      703.1    829.7      1200.0<br/>    ~ 1/1    14/13    40/33       3/2     21/13        2/1<br/>         126.6    207.4     369.1    126.6      370.3<br/>      ~  14:13    44:39     26:21    14:13      26:21</p><p>The large neutral third steps had a melodic effect that had a &quot;pelog&quot;<br/>feeling for me, although I suspect that some details of intonation<br/>might be a bit overly &quot;regular&quot; to approach the subtleties of a<br/>Javanese or Balinese ensenble.</p><p>Expanding to a seven-note tuning from which different pelog modes<br/>could be drawn was not difficult:</p><p>    0      1       2       3       4        5         6        7<br/>   0.0   126.6    334.0   495.7   703.1    829.7     1038.3  1200.0<br/> ~ 1/1   14/13    40/33    4/3     3/2     21/13     51/28     2/1<br/>      126.6   207.4   161.7   207.4   126.6     208.6     161.7<br/>   ~  14:13   44:39   56:51    9:8    14:13     44:39     56:51</p><p>Curiously, the complete 7-note set seems identical with a Near Eastern<br/>mode consisting of two distinct Segah tetrachords in the Ottoman<br/>manner. For pelog, however, we are typically selecting or motating<br/>between modes most often consisting of five-note or pentatonic<br/>subsets. To help in this process, note numbers from 0 to 7, following<br/>the conventions of Scala, are placed above the notes in the last<br/>diagram.</p><p>From this perspective, our original five-note mode consists of steps<br/>0-1-2-4-5-7 or 0.0-126.6-334.0-703.1-829.7-1200.0. Using the style of<br/>modename.par, we find it has a pattern of 1-1-2-1-2 steps, which that<br/>file describes as &quot;Patet Lima, Patet Nem, Jawar, Selisir.&quot;</p><p>Another mode known as &quot;Patet Lima, Nem with Pelog&quot; has a pattern of<br/>1-2-1-1-2, using steps 0-1-3-4-5-7:</p><p>          1        2        1       1        2<br/>       0       1        3       4       5         7<br/>      0.0    126.6     495.7   703.1   829.7    1200.0<br/>    ~ 1/1    14/13     4/3     3/2     21/13     2/1</p><p>Interestingly, this mode could be seen as a variation on a Malaysian<br/>pelog, pelog_mal.scl, in the Scala archive:</p><p>! pelog_mal.scl<br/>!<br/>Malaysian Pelog, Pierre Genest: Diff?rentes gammes encore en usage<br/> 5<br/>!<br/> 13/12<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 13/8<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here, if the Malaysian steps are at or very close to the just ratios<br/>given by Pierre Genest, the main difference apart from the mild<br/>tempering of 4/3 and 3/2 would be the use of 14/13 and 21/13 in place<br/>of 13/12 and 13/8.</p><p>This subtle distinction might avert a possible question of etiquette. In the tradition of gamelan, it has been considered impolite, and<br/>sometimes indeed outright forbidden, deliberately to copy the _embat_<br/>or distinctive intonational style of a given ensemble. Presumably this<br/>caution might apply to a traditional ensemble in Malaysia as well as<br/>Bali or Java, so that small but appreciable divergences are very<br/>welcome.</p><p>The five-note mode called Pelog uses the pattern 2-1-1-2-1, and<br/>invites a connection with a different musical culture:</p><p>            2       1       1        2        1<br/>       0         2      3       4         6       7<br/>      0.0      334.0  495.7   703.1     1038.3  1200.0<br/>    ~ 1/1      40/33   4/3     3/2      21/13    2/1</p><p>Here it might be said that there are two essentially symmetrical and<br/>disjunct trichords of 334.0-161.7 cents or 335.2-161.7 cents, with a<br/>central step close to 9:8, thus 0-2-3 and 4-6-7. The resulting Pelog<br/>pentatonic is very similar to a five-note subset of a hexatonic tuning<br/>used in Vietnam called Sa Mac Dan Tranh, tranh3.scl in the Scala<br/>archive, Dan Tranh being the name of a traditional Vietnamese zither:</p><p>! tranh3.scl<br/>!<br/>Sa Mac Dan Tranh scale<br/> 6<br/>!<br/> 17/14<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 38/21<br/> 51/28<br/> 2/1</p><p>Looking at this tuning raises for me a possible query as to whether<br/>the specified 38/21 step might actually have been intended as 34/21, a<br/>4:3 fourth above 17/14 and a 9:8 tone below 51/28. If so, then this<br/>complete hexatonic Vietnamese scale would be closely approximated as a<br/>subset of our 7-note pelog set. However, the Scala archive file<br/>art_nam.scl, a 9-note &quot;Artificial Nam System,&quot; also has a 38/21 step,<br/>so it appears that the relevant subset of the Sa Mac Dan Tranh tuning<br/>would be 1/1-17/14-4/3-3/2-51/28-2/1, very close to our Pelog mode<br/>above.</p><p>The Sa Mac mode is characteristic of Northern Vietnam, and associated<br/>with such emotions as nostalgia and melancholy. The topic of modal<br/>ethos or affect in different world traditions is a fascinating one, as<br/>is an exploration of the modal subsets and permutations found in pelog<br/>or Vietnamese music or the maqam/dastgah traditions of the Near East.<br/>The great variety of pentatonic pelog modes available within a 7-note<br/>set is a special delight.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
