Eerie... I like it a lot.</p><p>Glad you say this. Don&apos;t know why but I thought someone else would catch on first. Or that you preferred some more melodic stuff than harmonic. Nice to hear this from you. Now you know why lots of my scales are aimed at approximating JI -- or are JI themselves.<br/>I can tell anyone who&apos;s interested: If you want to test your singing limits, then try getting as close to JI as you can. Multi-track recording and linear tone series have been fantastic options since they came into use.</p><p>Petr</p><p>PS: Perhaps you know by chance about someone else making some similarly &quot;chordal&quot; music? I&apos;ve found Prent Rodgers&apos; mp3s and I really like lots of these.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2007 8:46:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; One in each way - i.e. modified recordings of voices and flutes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.yousendit.com/download/ZGJmYkJuTWNrWTk1VEE9PQ">www.yousendit.com/download/ZGJmYkJuTWNrWTk1VEE9PQ</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope it works today, the server has been doing strange things<br/>&gt; recently.</p><p>Cool sounds.

The lower tones then are tuned to 5/6-4/6-3/6 in the first chord, then to 6/7-5/7-4/7-3/7 in the second chord, then to 7/8-6/8-5/8-4/8-3/8 in the third chord and so on, until the last chord where they are tuned to 12/12...6/12. Of course, this is what I was imagining in my mind at the time I was thinking about the music. The way I finally approximated these with my voice is another matter.</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s the title of this piece?</p><p>I still haven&apos;t decided.

Many Prent&apos;s compositions come from clearly audible otonal structures (one of these pieces, for example, is the Tsantsa Circle Dance), which is what I love about this music. The matter was that I just wondered if I could find something new along these lines. I like JI, I like meantones, I like semi-sixths, I like Hanson, ... There&apos;s a lot of tunings that offer amazing possibilities as far as consonant chords are concerned.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@h-pi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2007 3:57:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>An absolutely gorgeous piece!

Thank you, Petr, for making this!</p><p>Glad you say this. For a change, I can tell you something about what I&apos;ve heard. I&apos;ve listened to your rondo in 19-EDO. One thing is that it sounded quite interesting to me and another thing is that it reminded me of something I was doing less than a year ago. Some people here may remember this. I just took a few chords and scales and then some improvised music and retuned the MIDI files with Scala. I made an archive containing the original 12-EDO version, the 5-limit JI version, the major-minor-swapped 5-limit JI version, and then two odd-ratio versions. Finally, I stored the used tunings in the archive as well and named the chord files with a &quot;C&quot; and the music midi files with an &quot;M&quot;. Maybe you&apos;ll find it interesting.
