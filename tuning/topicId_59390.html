They are the tension-creators. Without their<br/>&gt; presence in a raga, the vadi-samvadi cannot achieve resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cay we say, therefore, that these passing  and neighboring notes, in a<br/>&gt; way, act as leading notes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lastly, are they responsible for the &quot;rule&quot; that a raga must have at<br/>&gt; least five notes? [The raga-s with less than five notes are very few,<br/>&gt; and considered exceptions.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Hi Haresh,</p><p>It seems to me that you have very largely answered your own<br/>question!  In the affirmative, I might add.</p><p>However, one might say that in its typical usage in Western<br/>music for around 200 years, the major scale also has several<br/>notes which function as &quot;anuvadi&quot; or assonant notes, those that<br/>lead to a consonance.  Since, in this period, the third, fifth and<br/>octave are regarded as consonances with the root, the remaining<br/>scale degrees - second, fourth, sixth and seventh, have all, to a<br/>greater or lesser degree, the function of passing to a consonance.<br/>None of these degrees was felt, in itself, to form a stable<br/>consonance with the root.</p><p>I might paraphrase you, for this Western tonal context, thus:<br/>&gt; The passing  and neighboring notes, being dissonant with the<br/>&gt; neighboring notes which are consonances, cause aesthetic<br/>&gt; tension in a melody.  This tension is resolved on reaching any of<br/>&gt; the consonances.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with the terms, your question might have<br/>been clearer if you had explained the meanings of &quot;vadi&quot; and<br/>&quot;samvadi&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.323 / Virus Database: 267.9.2/53 - Release Date: 20/7/05</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2005 1:04:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, one might say that in its typical usage in Western<br/>&gt; music for around 200 years, the major scale also has several<br/>&gt; notes which function as &quot;anuvadi&quot; or assonant notes, those that<br/>&gt; lead to a consonance.

As the tonic triad was the definining &quot;home<br/>harmony&quot; of the major scale, it is consonance with the triad, not<br/>consonance with the root, that determines a scale degree&apos;s stability<br/>within the tonal system, in the sense you seem to be trying to point<br/>to above.</p><p>Note that only in major and natural minor modes does no note form a<br/>tritone with a note of the tonic triad, which I think was key in<br/>privileging these modes above the others upon the advent of tonal<br/>music in the West c.1670. For one thing, this makes the entire scale<br/>fit rather comfortably over the tonic triad, lending a sense of<br/>stability to the configuration, while most other triads would involve<br/>a vertical tritone against some scale degree and hence sit less<br/>stably. Resolving *both* notes of the tritone to notes of the tonic<br/>triad became a grammatical norm in Western tonal music, becoming the<br/>classic tension-release move in the style, and it isn&apos;t possible in<br/>the other modes of the diatonic scale.</p></div>
