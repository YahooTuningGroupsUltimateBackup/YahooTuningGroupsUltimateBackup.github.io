The publication schedule of 1/1 is irregular.  This is stated on the JIN<br/>web site and in printed flyers.  The most recent 1/1 was mailed in December<br/>1999.  As Lydia was kind enough to admit, the issue was delayed about six<br/>months while I waited for her article to arrive.  I do not know when the<br/>next 1/1 will be published, as I do not currently have the material on hand<br/>to fill an issue.  Any subscriber who is not satisfied with the frequency of<br/>publication may request a refund of the remainder of his or her subsciption<br/>at any time.  As othes have said, the best way to increase the frequency of<br/>publication is to submit an article.</p><p>2. Re. the Primer and other store orders.  Obviously, anyone who pays for<br/>merchandise deserves to receive it, and in a timely manner.  My impression<br/>is that most do.  I am sorry it is not all.  There was a period, around<br/>1994, when things were very badly managed indeed--store orders were just<br/>being tossed into a folder and forgotten, sometimes for months (the person<br/>who had responsibility for managing this aspect of the network had dropped<br/>the ball and was in total denial about his inability to do the job).  When I<br/>discovered this situation, I took over the filling of orders, which I did<br/>until fall 1996 when I left San Francisco.  Presently, I cannot supervise<br/>the day-to-day operation of the store, as I live and work 40 miles from the<br/>location where orders are received and filled.  However, if anyone emails me<br/>about orders not received in a timely manner, I will follow up.  (Obviously,<br/>it would be better if no such cases occurred, but good help is hard to<br/>find.)  I have received no communication from Paolo, and so am unable to<br/>judge whether his claim is accurate or not.</p><p>==========================================================================<br/>David B.
