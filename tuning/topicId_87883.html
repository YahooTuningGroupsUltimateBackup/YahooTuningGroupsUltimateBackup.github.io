In a first period, candidates may send me offlist a short mail saying that they are interested to participate, with their full postal address, profession /activities, and an eventual web page about their music.<br/>Please write only if you have a machine that meets the required configurations for installing Ethno 2 (check on MOTU&apos;s website page Specifications / Full system requirements) :<br/><a href="http://www.motu.com/techsupport/technotes/ethno-instrument-2-system-requirements">http://www.motu.com/techsupport/technotes/ethno-instrument-2-system-requirements</a><br/>(unfortunately Linux operating systems do not apply to those)<br/>2. In a second period, the AEH will answer either by accepting your candidature, or by refusing it (with an explanation), or by asking eventual precisions or links to some of your works.<br/>3. The AEH jury (composed of the AEH administrators and other adherents) will then deliberate and select 12 concurrents, will inform them personnally, and send them each one Ethno box, to our own charge (I can&apos;t say at the moment if the participants will have to pay customs charges at reception, but normally not).<br/>4. In a third period, the candidates will have up to the 21st of June 2010 to sent their musical works (free of rights), in the form of mp3 files, each one with a title and one line of presentation. Before this date participants have the possibility to cancel previously sent demos.<br/>5. The AEH jury will then select a few demos in different categories among which some, along with the musician name and line of presentation, will be proposed for the Ethno2 pages of MOTU&apos;s website, and eventually other sites. The results will be mailed to the participants and to the Tuning List.<br/>6. Without engagement about it, and only if the received demos show a high level of musical quality, the AEH may edit a CD mix of a collection of them.</p><p>SPECIFIC RULES :<br/>1. The competition is open to all and covers two categories :<br/>- the first one concerns works based on the original Ethno2 microtunings (except the default tuning) ;<br/>- the second one concerns all other microtunings, either from the Scala archive or other sources, or the participant&apos;s personal tunings.<br/>2. In both categories the tunings will have to be precised.<br/>3. There is no maximum of demos by participant for both categories, but whatever the tuning choices, selected participants have to produce at least THREE demos using the original Ethno2 tunings.<br/>The reasons for that rule are at least double : for one thing these original tunings represent an important research work from the AEH and hearing them played and perhaps commented by other musicians, besides being a great pleasure, will serve this work ; but also, musicians able to create their own tunings or even to choose them from other sources being an infime proportion of Ethno2 potential purchasers, it is fair to ask that all participants, even if advanced microtonalists, contribute to a minimum of demos using the original tunings.<br/>Original tunings, when issued from recurrent series, can be modified by extension to other series of the same algorithms, as well as to more than 12 notes of the same series.<br/>4. Musical styles are open, they can range from traditional music or imitations, ethno-rock, or experimental, ETC., but should have a microtonal character AND be pleasant to hear, even for non-connoisseurs.<br/>5. Ethno has to be the only sound source, and the only tools authorized to make these demos are Ethno2, and multitrack recorders or audio/MIDI sequencers.  For not more than one half of the demos sent is conceded the possibility to use the participant&apos;s own voice or another singer&apos;s voice (but no samples), in addition to Ethno instruments.<br/>6. Except for improbable combinations we dissuade the use of melodic loops and phrases from Ethno, simply because their tunings are non-tunable, either 12-ET or undefined, and would add confusion.<br/>7. Demos can be sent any time at Jacques Dudon&apos;s personal mail :<br/>fotosonix@...<br/>8. They should be in mp3 format, 44,1 Khz MPEG stereo, 160 kbps.<br/>9. Their minimum duration should be 50&quot;, and maximum 3 minutes (in the eventuality of a CD release, longer versions and in WAV format could be asked from the participants).<br/>10. Participants who fail to fulfill the rules for whatever reason or unforeseen difficulty will have to uninstall Ethno2 and return the full Ethno box to their own charges to the AEH as soon as possible and before the 21st of May 2010 at latest.<br/>11. People who already own Ethno2 may participate for fun, without the required minimum of 3 demos asked to other participants.<br/>12. The AEH has no objection to the divulgation of the demos in competition by their authors at any time (for example through links mailed to the Tuning List, but NOT by sending files to the Tuning List).</p><p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONS :<br/>A technical report on Ethno 2 by myself and additional infos on the original tunings can be consulted in messages 87410 and 87411 (14th of april) :<br/>Some technical aspects of Ethno2<br/>Ethno2 microtunings<br/>then in message 87434 (15th of april) :<br/>Re: Ethno2 microtunings</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques Dudon</p></div><h3><a id=87885 href="#87885">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2010 7:15:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As an owner of Ethno 1 since its appearance, I&apos;m interested to enter this competition, but unfortunately in the end of May I travel to Europe where I&apos;ll stay one month (small concert tour and visit of my former homeland after three years).

Sometimes there&apos;s a drone - fifth grade of the scale. Often rather complex polyphonic leading of voices and rather unusual modulations and surprising harmonic progressions, and using of yodeling effects and falsetto in male choruses. Polyphony reminds Orthodox Church chants. Modal harmony. Sometimes neutral third, or missing third, or quartal chord. Seventh chords often only as a result of polyphonic paralel movement in thirds on fifth drone, so third is missing. Often 5/4 metre. In 3/4 metre rhythm oscillates between 3/4 and 6/8 like in Spanish/Latin music. Almost no microtonality.</p><p>- instrumental music - rich ornamentation of melodies, voice leading for example of two flutes is same like in vocal music (paralel thirds). In dances accelerando can be found very often.</p><p>I suppose some infuence of Slavonic (Russian) music can be expected in folklore and Orthodox Church music.</p><p>Armenia:<br/>- vocal music - mixed choirs similar to Georgian, seven-tone scales (Ionian mainly, Lydian, Phrygian, Aeolian), bigger influence of Turkish music (maqam hijjaz), but not much ornamentation, melodies in paralel thirds or even triads, unusual modal jumps, often drone and melody in unison and octaves, 5/4 metre, combined metres like in Balcan music - often 3+2+3+2+2, rich syncopation.</p><p>- instrumental music - melodic instruments play in unison<br/>I didn&apos;t hear any microtones or temperament in the records I have.</p><p>Thanks to their own church (Armenian Apostolic Church) they could probably avoid deeper influence of Russian Orthodox Church music.</p><p>Bulgaria:<br/>They have very rich folklore with quite different influences - protopentatonics, pentatonics, shepherd&apos;s flute Carpathian culture with natural scale (Lydian+Mixolydian), Old Byzantion culture and Greek music (7-tone diatonic scales, even Locrian), Turkish and Arabic music (maqam hijjaz, mustaar, karjagar, huzam, quartertones), Russian Orthodox Church, Catholic Gregorian Chant, minor second paralel mixtures in choir singing... 7-tone scales, drones, rich ornamentation, glissandos, Complex metres and rhythms (like 2+3, 2+2+3, 2+2+2+3, 2+3+2+2, 3+2+2+2, 2+2+3+2+2, 3+2+3, 3+2+2+3, 2+2+3+3, 3+3+2+2, 2+3+3+3, 3+2+3+3, 3+3+2+3, 2+2+2+2+3, 3+2+2+2+2, 2+2+2+3+2, 3+2+2+2+3, 2+2+3+2+3, 2+3+2+2+3, 3+2+2+3+2, 3+2+3+2+3, 2+3+3+2+3, 3+2+3+3+3, 3+3+3+2+3, 2+2+2+2+2+3, 3+4+2+2+3+4...).</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 1 May 2010, at 6:44 AM, genewardsmith wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dear Ozan,<br/>&gt; &gt; Not only I would be really glad to welcome the only &quot;non-western&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; candidate...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never been sure if Turkey is non-western or not, but I suppose &gt; when it comes to music it is.
