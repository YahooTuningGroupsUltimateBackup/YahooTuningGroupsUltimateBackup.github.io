I think you were not talking about Fibonacci numbers (1+1=2,<br/>1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8, 13, 21, ...) but about square numbers (1+3=4,<br/>4+5=9, 9+7=16, ...). While it is reasonable to suppose that Fibonacci<br/>desribed the sequence of square numbers like this in book on<br/>mathematics from 1202, I am positive that the Greeks knew about this<br/>sequence and &quot;polygonal numbers&quot; in general, and it is unlikely that<br/>this knowledge had been forgotten for a while.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2005 11:20:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; While it is reasonable to suppose that Fibonacci<br/>&gt; desribed the sequence of square numbers like this in book on<br/>&gt; mathematics from 1202, I am positive that the Greeks knew about this<br/>&gt; sequence and &quot;polygonal numbers&quot; in general, and it is unlikely that<br/>&gt; this knowledge had been forgotten for a while.</p><p>You&apos;ll actually find a table of figurate numbers in Nichomachus&apos;s<br/>Introduction to Arithmetic, which as one of the Great Books is sitting<br/>around unread in many people&apos;s libraries.</p></div><h3>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2005 11:58:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;While it is reasonable to suppose that Fibonacci &gt;&gt;desribed the sequence of square numbers like this in book on &gt;&gt;mathematics from 1202, I am positive that the Greeks knew about this &gt;&gt;sequence and &quot;polygonal numbers&quot; in general, and it is unlikely that &gt;&gt;this knowledge had been forgotten for a while.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You&apos;ll actually find a table of figurate numbers in Nichomachus&apos;s<br/>&gt; Introduction to Arithmetic, which as one of the Great Books is sitting<br/>&gt; around unread in many people&apos;s libraries.</p><p>Not in my library.
