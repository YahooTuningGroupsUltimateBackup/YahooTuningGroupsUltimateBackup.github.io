I wonder if a MIDI-version could eventually help a<br/>*real* stringquartet to gain accuracy for the intonation of quarter tone<br/>values. As a quarter tone guitarist, when I try to sing ahead of what I&apos;m<br/>playing, the resulting notes do not always correspond to what the frets tell<br/>me. (Is this because of the harmonic entropy, my voice being naturally<br/>attracted to nearby simple ratios?) I wonder if string players actually hear<br/>the sound of the quarter tones before they set their finger, or if it&apos;s a<br/>mechanical process, consisting of fingering halfway between two 12-ET<br/>values? In that case your MIDI realization would be most helpfull.</p><p>&gt; As Partch argued so much, no amount of theory can<br/>&gt; replace the function of *significant music* in changing<br/>&gt; one&apos;s willingness to accept an alternative tuning system.</p><p>Agree. I had one of my guitars transformed into 24-ET to have access to Haba<br/>and Carrillo. I just purchased a very good Pappalardo guitar, which<br/>eventually can be  transformed into another n-ET  version, but who&apos;s gonna<br/>be the composer?</p><p>&gt; HABA&apos;S DIFFERENT USES OF QUARTER-TONES<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haba&apos;s use of quarter-tones in this particular piece<br/>&gt; falls into three distinct categories:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) The notes of the 12-eq chromatic scale are &apos;targets&apos;,<br/>&gt; and the quarter-tones above and below (more often above)<br/>&gt; are used as appogiaturas which resolve to the 12-eq pitch.<br/>&gt; The appogiaturas are usually of longer duration than the<br/>&gt; resolving note.</p><p>It also happens that 12-eq notes are clearly resolving into quarter-tones!</p><p>&gt; 3) Melodic passages, sometimes in parallel harmony, of<br/>&gt; successive &apos;3/4-tone&apos; [150-cent] intervals, which can<br/>&gt; be considered subsets of octatonic scales comprised<br/>&gt; entirely of conjunct 3/4-tone steps, i.e.:</p><p>I&apos;ve not yet heard Haba use all the eight steps in a row. That&apos;s what<br/>Carrillo is doing all the time.</p><p>&gt; Later, as can be heard in the opening of the _14th Quartet_<br/>&gt; (also on my website), he used pentatonic scales with essential<br/>&gt; 5/4-tone [= 1 &amp; 1/4-tone = 250 cent] intervals.  (I&apos;ll shortly<br/>&gt; be sending a posting on that piece.)</p><p>His Detske Nalady Opus Nr. 51 (for guitar and child&apos;s voice) is full of<br/>that. Defintely one of his most *consonant* quarter-tone compositions.</p><p>&gt; MONZO QUARTER-TONE NOTATION</p><p>With 24 steps and only 7 different names the use of *phantasy* accidentals<br/>implies too much brain-activity before we realize what step or interval<br/>we&apos;re talking about. Your notation is a keyboard tablature, which allows a<br/>quick overview, very practical to recognize e.g. a scale in 3/4 or 5/4-tone<br/>steps immediately. I adapted standard guitar tablature notation myself, but<br/>transformed it into 24 numbers in an octave. I skipped the dots on the neck<br/>of the instrument and numbered every position separately (from 1 up to 24!).<br/>The octatonic scale in 3/4-tone steps, starting on a low E,  would read:</p><p>E   ------------------------------<br/>B   ------------------------------<br/>G   ------------------------------<br/>D   ------------------------------<br/>A   ------------------------------<br/>E   0--3--6--9--12--15--18--21--24 if played on one string, or:</p><p>E   -------------------------<br/>B   -------------------------<br/>G   -------------------------<br/>D   ---------------------1--4<br/>A   ------------2--5--8------<br/>E   0--3--6--9--------------- if played on seperate strings. Note that<br/>the fourth is exactly 10 steps.</p><p>I *hear* the music better while watching numbers then seeing standard notes<br/>with phantasy-accidentals. The same could be true for a keyboard-player,<br/>perceiving the inner sound, as soon as it&apos;s connected to a fingering.<br/>Dowland used it all his life!</p><p>Besides, when performing quarter-tone music, I finger most 5/4-tone steps in<br/>such a way that the interval gets slighly larger,  pushing up the string<br/>with my third or fourth finger. Especially for Haba this gives a  more<br/>natural result. 5/4-tone (250 cents) is of course attracted to the 7/6 ratio<br/>(267 cents).</p><p>This is the very end of the Suite Nr.2 Opus 67 for quarter-tone guitar:</p><p>E  0---0-O---7-5-0---------------------------0------14-----------5----<br/>B  0-------5-------5-0-----------------------0----------15------5-----<br/>G  2-------------------5-2----------------3-----13-------------2------<br/>D  ------------------------9-4----------------------------------------<br/>A  4---------------------------9-4-----9----------------------4-------<br/>E  0--------------------------------0------------------------0--------</p><p>If the two last figures were 6 instead of 5, the chord would be very simular<br/>to the one Jimi Hendrix used so often.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
