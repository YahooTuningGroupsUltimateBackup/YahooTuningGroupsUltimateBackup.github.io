I didn&apos;t set out 15 years ago<br/>in my microtonal journey, to come to rest here at the foot of Mount<br/>Hubris, where such high-brow and &quot;middle-brow&quot; art/mathematical<br/>snobbery and arrogance thwarts the very spirit of community and music<br/>making; which is so sorely missing in this forum. The reek of<br/>Academic aloofness here does not inspire good music, but only serves<br/>to sour the stomach and relationships. It&apos;s not too hard to notice an<br/>enormous list of historical figures that have contributed to the<br/>majority of all meaningful art and science, that were completely<br/>outside of the &quot;accepted&quot; academic circles of art, thought and<br/>science - try the entire Non-Western world, Copernicus, to Coltrane<br/>to Zappa. Westerners look at the World through their judging pair of<br/>Western Glasses, which are smudged over by centuries of Hubris, and<br/>pass their skewed Western conclusions onto everything in site in the<br/>name of academic authority, and from within a cozy framework of<br/>intellectual necrophilia. This I find beyond repugnant. I find<br/>outside of  this forum something that you may have forgotten<br/>about &quot;The Real World Of Music Creation&quot; - into which I will shortly<br/>retire to it&apos;s lovely paradisal gardens. I&apos;ve made it 15 years<br/>without one iota of help from the likes of the Hubris Kings - never<br/>needed you - never will. Hey Kings - I invite you to gaze down on us<br/>mere mortals, and &quot;slow brained cretins&quot; through your arrogant<br/>hateful and judging eyes, and check out the cool music that&apos;s being<br/>made while you guys play your little Glass Bead Game! We&apos;ve been<br/>doing this since pre-history! You just came along thousands of years<br/>later and tried to get your name attached to it. No need for the<br/>arrogant stamp of approval from the Hubris Kings of Academia! There&apos;s<br/>so many of you guys littering the shoulder of the real highway of<br/>music like so much road-kill, that we stopped keeping count centuries<br/>ago. Ah, the grounds of the Tuning List are fertile for growing a<br/>huge harvest of Shoenberg&apos;s, Milton Babbitts and Pierre Boulez&apos;. My<br/>time here has underscored something that I have known for years -<br/>namely that the fundamental pitch relationships are only a facet of<br/>real music making. Hear this simple truth.</p><p>Joseph wrote:<br/>... and it takes a bit of &quot;self awareness&quot; and<br/>magnanimity to realize that one&apos;s self is not always the center of<br/>the universe or that maybe one&apos;s talents are not even the greatest in<br/>the universe.</p><p>This is truly the mirror to hold in front of one&apos;s own face, and this<br/>is my challenge to what will soon be my former fellow listers,<br/>because I really feel sorrow for those that feel that here at the<br/>foot of Mount Hubris is any center of anything good about creating a<br/>meaningful body of microtonal work. It is a hallucination at work<br/>here - perpetuated by a mob instinct, and carried out by the<br/>lame &quot;yes-men&quot;, who Kiss Ass and Kow-Tow to every mathematical whim<br/>and mood of the moment. This isn&apos;t about music, this equates more<br/>with the effort to find the North West Passage - or the rush to the<br/>U.S. West during the 1800s, to &quot;stake out your territory&quot; - as well<br/>as having a fertile ground for narrow minded games of petty one-<br/>upmanship. Well allot of folks died in the process from their hubris,<br/>and some have ice bergs and lands named after them - and guess what<br/>(?) - who gives a shit!

I hope that<br/>much of what you said was blowing off<br/>emotional steam and not meant<br/>literally.  I must say that I found some<br/>of it perplexing.  For example, &quot;the<br/>very spirit of community and music<br/>making; which is so sorely missing in<br/>this forum,&quot; and a reference to &quot;The<br/>reek of Academic aloofness.&quot;  I&apos;ve been<br/>following the List for over three<br/>years.  I have yet to smell the reek of<br/>academic aloofness.  In fact, my feeling<br/>has been, right from the start, &quot;Ah,<br/>finally a place where I feel at home.&quot;<br/>The sense of community is precisely what<br/>has made me stay so long.  For the<br/>record, I&apos;m no ivory tower type.  I work<br/>in the trenches, writing and recording<br/>commercial music, song demos, and indie<br/>records in Nashville, TN.  I have no<br/>advanced degree, only a Bachelor of<br/>Music degree in Church Music.  The<br/>extent of my math education is Algebra<br/>II in high school.  The Tuning List is a<br/>haven for people like me, who went to<br/>school in hopes of learning how music<br/>worked, but came away with little more<br/>than a head knowledge of Western<br/>traditions.</p><p>There are some of us musicians who feel<br/>compelled to discover as much as we can<br/>about how music works.  Others don&apos;t<br/>care at all - they make music<br/>instinctively; theory disinterests<br/>them.  I record both kinds of musicians<br/>every week.  Often, I see some of each<br/>on a single session.  I know some of<br/>each kind who are great, good, mediocre,<br/>and poor, in terms of both skill and raw<br/>talent, and in terms of ability to write<br/>and/or perform music.  I have observed<br/>no particular bias one way or the other,<br/>as to how level of theoretical interest<br/>corresponds to quality of musical<br/>output.  I value both kinds of musicians<br/>very highly.</p><p>You may be one of those who are not<br/>particularly interested in how music<br/>works - you just want to make it.  If<br/>so, then in all honesty the Tuning List<br/>is probably not the best use of your<br/>time.  That doesn&apos;t make you inferior,<br/>wrong, nor &quot;small brained.&quot;  But neither<br/>does that mean that the List is a waste<br/>of time for those of us who must try to<br/>find out.</p><p>From time to time, especially when the<br/>discussions become intensely<br/>mathematical, someone will suggest that<br/>we all stop studying and start making<br/>music.  Think about the ramifications of<br/>that suggestion for the Tuning List for<br/>a moment.  How in the world is a<br/>text-based discussion list supposed to<br/>make music?!  It&apos;s an alluring<br/>suggestion at first sight, but it&apos;s<br/>really quite preposterous. It&apos;s a bit<br/>like suggesting that auto engineers<br/>could get more done by driving around<br/>than by sitting at their drawing<br/>boards.  Certainly, auto engineers<br/>should drive cars that they have<br/>designed as often as is feasible, and<br/>music theoreticians should compose music<br/>with their theories as they develop.<br/>But one cannot design a better car<br/>simply by driving, and one cannot<br/>advance music theory simply by<br/>composing.  And rather obviously, one<br/>cannot make music by writing and reading<br/>posts on a discussion list.  One can,<br/>however, help himself and others to come<br/>to a deeper understanding and<br/>appreciation of music.  One can also<br/>quickly discover ways of making music<br/>that he would otherwise have overlooked,<br/>however many years he practiced and<br/>performed.  My own ability to pinpoint a<br/>tuning problem in the midst of a<br/>recording session, and to make a<br/>relevant suggestion about how to correct<br/>it, has been immeasurably increased by<br/>my studies in conjunction with the<br/>List.  People stare at me like I&apos;m a<br/>magician or something, sometimes.</p><p>Jacky, what would you have the Tuning<br/>List to be?  A volley of subjective<br/>opinions about how music sounds and how<br/>to play it?  If that&apos;s what you want,<br/>then you would be well advised to find<br/>or start a list that fits that<br/>description, and to name it<br/>appropriately.  I submit that most of<br/>the Tuning List subscribers would not<br/>find such a list interesting for very<br/>long.  If the List were to be reduced to<br/>that, it would die, IMHO; I, for one,<br/>would lose interest in it in less than a<br/>week.  It&apos;s nice to get little<br/>interjections about it now and then, as<br/>I myself have made - and I have enjoyed<br/>yours, too.  But the purpose of the<br/>Tuning List is, by definition, to<br/>discuss matters of tuning as they relate<br/>to the making of music, not to discuss<br/>the making of music itself; nor to make<br/>music, which is not a feasible objective<br/>for a discussion list.  Since tuning is<br/>a purely mathematical field, charts,<br/>graphs, diagrams, formulae, and lists of<br/>generated figures constitute the<br/>clearest, most succinct, and therefore<br/>most valuable means of carrying on the<br/>discussion at hand.  (The List is also,<br/>of course, a place to announce<br/>performances of microtonal music and to<br/>discuss the meaning and purpose of<br/>composing microtonal music.)</p><p>The work being done on the List right<br/>now seems to be really coming to a<br/>head.  The contributions of people such<br/>as Paul Erlich, Dan Stearns, Graham<br/>Breed, Wilson-via-Grady, Joe Monzo, John<br/>deLaubenfels, Keenan Pepper, and Joe<br/>Pehrson have been vectoring together for<br/>some time now.  Things are starting to<br/>gel into some genuinely important<br/>developments.  Who are these people?<br/>Are they ivory tower musicians?  AFAIK,<br/>none holds a full time job in either<br/>music or academia.  (Please, forgive me<br/>for leaving out some important<br/>contributors, as I&apos;m sure I have done!<br/>I only offer these names as<br/>representative for the purpose of making<br/>a point.)</p><p>In fact, who are the professional<br/>musicians and music teachers on the<br/>list?  Some (not all!) of them are the<br/>very same people who suggest from time<br/>to time that the math is overwhelming<br/>the music making!  Seldom do they<br/>advance any of the heavy music theory<br/>posts that stir up occasional negative<br/>reactions.  What I&apos;m driving at is that<br/>you may have pinned your complaints on<br/>the wrong people. This is not in any way<br/>a backhanded insult on the pros and<br/>teachers.  All have made valuable<br/>contributions to the List, just not<br/>typically of the sort against which you<br/>reacted.</p><p>Lastly, I think that your final reaction<br/>was against the harsh statements of only<br/>one or two people.  I don&apos;t believe that<br/>the List as a whole condemns you nor<br/>your point of view.  I&apos;m quite certain<br/>that those who routinely post the<br/>&quot;heavy&quot; stuff held no animosity towards<br/>you prior to your parting post.  (One<br/>could hardly blame them if they do now,<br/>but they probably don&apos;t.  They probably<br/>feel sad to lose you, as do I.)  I wish<br/>you well, and hope that you find a<br/>musical home on or off the web, one that<br/>suits your particular interests and to<br/>which you can participate comfortably as<br/>a community member.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>--<br/>David J.

But in a lot of ways, I&apos;m<br/>glad it happened that way, because if I had simply read<br/>Fokker&apos;s and Wilson&apos;s work before my mind was prepared to<br/>understand all the ramifications, I&apos;m certain it would have<br/>had only a tiny fraction of the impact that it actually has<br/>had, since now I see how my work fits into a &apos;tradition&apos; begun<br/>by them.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
