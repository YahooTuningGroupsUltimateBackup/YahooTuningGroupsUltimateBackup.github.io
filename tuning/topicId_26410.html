That disclaimer<br/>made, I will (at your request) let you know what I think about a few of<br/>your comments.</p><p>&gt; In order to find the optimal<br/>&gt; tuning system, I must first search after purity of ratios.  I feel that there<br/>&gt; are many ratios, possessing certain purities, which have never been<br/>&gt; discovered.</p><p>Why ratios?<br/>What would an undiscovered ratio look like?<br/>What is purity?<br/>How pure does something have to be for a human being to consume?</p><p>I think I may have started out with some of the same concerns, I wanted<br/>more &quot;in tune&quot; consonances and &quot;new hitherto unheard&quot; consonances. I<br/>now believe that consonances are pretty much known and have something<br/>to do with low-numbered-ratios. Thats fine, I wouldn&apos;t expect a<br/>painter to spend a lot of time looking for another primary color.</p><p>But there ARE low-numbered-ratios which are not approximated well (or<br/>at all) in 12 and some of those that ARE approximated in 12 can be<br/>significantly improved upon (if they bother you). This can lead you<br/>to all kinds of other ETs, or to building JI pitch collections, or<br/>whatever... There is also the opposite extreme of finding tension<br/>and release in a vocabulary completely absent of low-numbered-ratio<br/>approximations!</p><p>&gt; It would only be through the experimentation of a new system<br/>&gt; that I would be able to figure out what its true potential was.  I have been<br/>&gt; doing such experimentation with the 12 ET system.  I have found that it lacks<br/>&gt; consonance to a large degree.  There are few real &quot;consonances&quot; with 12 ET.</p><p>Your first statement is entirely correct (and no, I haven&apos;t spent enough<br/>time with the systems that I haven&apos;t rejected like poisonous snakes to<br/>have any idea when a systems magic has really had time to make itself<br/>apparent).</p><p>12tet has awesome fifths and fourths. The thirds and sixths are certainly<br/>spicy compared to the just intervals they are assumed to approximate, however<br/>there is abundant proof in the world that this is acceptable.</p><p>&gt; There are a great deal of dissonances that exist.  These dissonances are not<br/>&gt; very good either because they tend to &quot;blend&quot; into one another.</p><p>I&apos;m beginning to agree with this, and have begun to think along the lines<br/>of consonance, dissonance, and some wide middle ground that isn&apos;t much of<br/>either. This has come through my limited microtonal experiments where<br/>OCCAISIONALLY I have found things that had the effect of &quot;new dissonance&quot;<br/>on me (things that I thought would be &quot;new consonance&quot; in some<br/>cases), whereas many new intervals are sortof &apos;blah&apos;, and stacking<br/>intervals (big chords) can EASILY just cancel the consonant or dissonant<br/>affect of the component intervals.</p><p>&gt; I have<br/>&gt; discovered that this blending is no good.  Each individual tone, or chord,<br/>&gt; should have a distinct quality whether that be a consonant or a dissonant<br/>&gt; one.</p><p>As has been alluded to in another thread, context has a lot to do with<br/>these things.</p><p>&gt; This will allow the a piece of music in the new system to have a<br/>&gt; stronger effect upon one&apos;s perceived memory. This will also make music much<br/>&gt; more powerful since it is the computation of the relations between ratios<br/>&gt; which gives music its strengths or weaknesses.  Please let me know what you<br/>&gt; think.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&quot;since it is the computation of the relations between ratios<br/>which gives music its strengths or weaknesses.&quot; I think a statement like<br/>this could be questioned. Is it true for a solo melody? Is it true for<br/>malody over drone? Is it true independent of timbre, register, dynamics,<br/>tempo, etc?</p><p>Keep digging. There are mountains of resources (people/web pages/audio<br/>clips/etc) to question every assumption and thought you may have had<br/>about any of this stuff.</p><p>It is very attractive to think that these resources will allow you not<br/>to do the ear-work. The more ear-work I do, the more I realize I&apos;m still<br/>at the very beginning of this search, even to answer the simplest<br/>question, &quot;what am I hoping to get&quot;.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=26435 href="#26435">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/25/2001 7:23:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26410.html#26410">/tuning/topicId_26410.html#26410</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep digging.
