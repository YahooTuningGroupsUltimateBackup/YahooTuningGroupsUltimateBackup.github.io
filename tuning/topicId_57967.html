Oh, I get it, you hit space after the quote.  How I&apos;m learning!</p><p>I still don&apos;t know how to get a pound sign, though.  That is, a real pound sign.</p><p>Is even Latin-1 ubiquitous?  I don&apos;t think my mobile phone supports it, for example.  Just for the hell of it, I decided to find out which Unicode characters from 128 to 255 Python can convert to GB2312.

Don&apos;t know what it stands for.  All of those that do latin characters also have Greek and Cyrillic except for Kartika (which does Malayalam) and Vrinda (which does Bengali).  A few of them do Hebrew, Arabic and characters like &sung; and &#x266B;.</p><p>3) TrueType fonts, which have a huge character set, and I don&apos;t really want to check what&apos;s missing.</p><p>Most applications magically work with any character I throw at them.

This might not &gt; be the case anymore, but I know there are a few out there that only have &gt; access to older, less powerful systems and slower connections. And e-mail is &gt; different than the Web.</p><p>There are a load of spammer tricks associated with HTML e-mail.  You can add web bugs, and format it to get round or confuse filters.  A lot of worms manipulate bugs in it.  Frankly, the best option&apos;s to treat any HTML email from a stranger as spam.  So it shouldn&apos;t be allowed in mailing lists.  The difference with websites is at least you choose to visit them.</p><p>Also -- although maybe the technology&apos;s improved here -- HTML never used to work in digests.  The MIME type has to be consistent for the whole message.</p><p>All of which is orthogonal to the character set.  I&apos;ve declared this message to be UTF-8, so anything from fran&ccedil;ais to &#x4E2D;&#x6587; should work. Let&apos;s see how it comes out!  I expect it&apos;ll still cause trouble with digests, at least.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s also still considered proper netiquette to limit HTML use in e-mail, if &gt; I&apos;m not mistaken.</p><p>It really depends on who you&apos;re writing to.  Where you don&apos;t need to worry about bandwidth, the best thing is to include both plain text and HTML, which is common.  Then it&apos;s up to the client whether to render the HTML.  I notice mine sticks to plain text, which is good.  I&apos;m not sure when I told it that...</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>George D.

I guess it&apos;s the teacher in me coming out ... :-)  I<br/>was rather<br/>&gt; hoping that other members would consider editing a page or two on<br/>&gt; the tuning wiki, thus giving a more gently-paced intro to the arcane<br/>&gt; world of alternate tunings.</p><p>You&apos;re welcome to place a link to the mythology, if you like.  You<br/>noticed that, unfortunately, it still isn&apos;t finished -- Dave Keenan<br/>and I already have so many irons in the fire that we have to be<br/>highly selective about how to spend our time and energy.  We&apos;ve<br/>already made our best effort in the introduction to the mythology to<br/>give a rationale for alternate tunings and our notation (both on an<br/>historical and acoustical level), and there are other things that are<br/>now more pressing (Episode 3 being near the top of the list).</p><p>&gt; As regards question #5, I have certainly enjoyed the music on the<br/>&gt; Gift of the Gods pages: the piece in 19-et feels<br/>especially &quot;different&quot;<br/>&gt; yet also especially &quot;right&quot;.</p><p>Thank you.  Those four recordings are nearly 30 years old, predating<br/>both the personal computer and MIDI.  The 19-ET piece that plays on<br/>the Sagittal homepage was composed by Ivor Darreg (Prelude No. 1 for<br/>guitar) and performed by me on the Scalatron with generalized<br/>keyboard:</p><p><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/</a></p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2005 8:29:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Danny,</p><p>You replied as below.
