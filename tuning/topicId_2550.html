This strongly implies a harmonic<br/>&gt; series which is a readily recognizable psycho-acoustic pattern in frequency<br/>&gt; space.  Human beings seem to like these harmonic series patterns.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Looking for a new hobby?

Following this, white noise<br/>&gt;is no longer all that dissonant.</p><p>That may be part of the answer for lower-limit examples, but:</p><p>&gt;To apply this to the example you cited: the 11:9 dyad may be<br/>&gt;quite dissonant when played alone, but when played in the<br/>&gt;context of a 4:5:6:7:9:11, many of the partials may be masked by the<br/>&gt;lower tones, and so the whole has considerably less sensory dissonance<br/>&gt;than it might at first appear.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t apply this to the example, since lots of dissonant dyads would<br/>still sound dissonant over 4:5:6:7. In this example, 9 and 11 form a<br/>harmonic-series segment with the other notes, and thus the entire chord<br/>&quot;blends&quot; and has much of the character of a single tone. All fundamentals,<br/>partials, and combination tones form a harmonic series over a fundamental<br/>two octaves below the root of the chord. Because of the psychoacoustic<br/>virtual pitch phenomenon, this complex will be heard as a very clear pitch<br/>sensation. Although part of dissonance is the roughness (what you call<br/>sensory dissonance), part of it is the complexity of the virtual pitch<br/>sensation, which my harmonic entropy concept provides mathematical models<br/>for. If you believe in the pattern-matching theories of virtual pitch, this<br/>component might be described as &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; of trying to<br/>understand the heard stimulus in termps of a learned pattern of harmonics.<br/>But periodicity mechanisms in hearing are well-established for periods<br/>between 20 and 1000 Hz. So it could very likely be that hearing a<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 chord under the right circumstances, the brain actually detects<br/>the exact repetition of a signal with a period corresponding to the<br/>frequency of the 1 (two octaves below the root).</p><p>Either way, the sensory component roughness is somehow counteracted by<br/>another component, while in a 1/11:1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 chord, although the<br/>sensory dissonance is virtually the same, even considering masking, there is<br/>no equivalent phenomenon to &quot;simplify&quot; the sensation, and it sounds very<br/>dissonant.</p><p>What we were talking about, Bill, is the fact that a 720-cent fifth sounds<br/>kind of off when the dyad is played alone, but in the context of 15-tET<br/>triads it doesn&apos;t sound so bad. Do you think masking is responsible? How?</p></div>
