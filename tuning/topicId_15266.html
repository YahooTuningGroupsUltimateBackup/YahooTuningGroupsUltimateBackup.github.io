Some flavors of the most proximal quad<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>As already mentioned (Section 1.2), the concept of a neo-Gothic flavor<br/>tends to focus on the tuning of the unstable intervals found in most<br/>proximal quads and their three-voice subsets or triples (Section 4):<br/>especially M3, m3, and M6 for finer distinctions, and also M2 and m7<br/>for larger ones.</p><p>Here is a table of some common flavors or intonational regions for the<br/>tuning of the most proximal quad, with examples from specific tuning<br/>systems. No attempt is made to delimit exact borders for these<br/>overlapping and very pleasantly &quot;fuzzy&quot; regions of the continuum:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  Flavor   Ratio zone   Sample      Expansive     Contractive   Steps<br/>             M3   m3    Tuning     (1-M3-5-M6)    (1-m3-5-m7)   T   S<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> 3-flavor  81:64 32:27  Pythag    0-408-702-906  0-294-702-996  204 90<br/>......................................................................<br/>11-flavor  14:11 13:11  Noble5th  0-416-704-912  0-288-704-992  208 80<br/>......................................................................<br/>23-flavor  23:18 27:23  17-tET    0-424-706-918  0-282-706-988  212 71<br/>......................................................................<br/> 7-flavor   9:7   7:6   22-tET    0-436-709-927  0-273-709-981  218 55<br/>                        Pythag    0-431-702-929  0-271-702-973  204 67<br/>......................................................................<br/>13-flavor  13:10 15:13  29-tET    0-455-703-952  0-248-703-952  207 41<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As a legend on the chart may suggest, a flavor is an impressionistic<br/>&quot;ratio zone&quot; where unstable intervals of a most proximate quad<br/>approximate certain ratios. For example, the &quot;11-flavor&quot; is a region<br/>where major thirds are in the general vicinity of 14:11 (~417.51<br/>cents), and/or minor thirds in the vicinity of 13:11 (~289.20 cents).</p><p>Our example of the 11-flavor may especially well illustrate why<br/>neo-Gothic flavors should not be confused with the &quot;limits&quot; of just<br/>intonation (JI) theory. The ratios 14:11 and 13:11 both belong to the<br/>11-flavor because they conveniently share the common factor of 11, but<br/>would have different prime-limits as well as odd-limits (11 and 13<br/>respectively).</p><p>The 11-flavor also illustrates another aspect of the &quot;flavor as<br/>ratio-zone concept&quot;: with regular tunings, the characteristic ratios<br/>for major and minor thirds may actually occur or be approximated most<br/>closely at slightly different points in the spectrum, suggesting a<br/>region with subtle shadings leaning toward one ratio or the other.</p><p>For example, in the &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;milder&quot; 11-flavor region around<br/>29-tET, minor thirds are close to 13:11 (~289.66 cents in 29-tET) but<br/>major thirds (~413.79 cents) somewhat narrower than 14:11.</p><p>In the &quot;central&quot; 11-flavor region exemplified by Keenan Pepper&apos;s<br/>&quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning[6] shown on the chart (fifths ~704.10 cents,<br/>~2.14 cents wide), both regular thirds (~416.38 cents, ~287.72 cents)<br/>are quite close to these ratios -- within 1.5 cents in this tuning.</p><p>In the &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;stronger&quot; 11-flavor region, as in the &quot;e-based<br/>tuning&quot;[7] (fifths ~704.61 cents, ~2.65 cents wide), major thirds are at<br/>or slightly larger than 14:11 (here ~418.43 cents) while minor thirds<br/>(~286.18 cents) are rather smaller than 13:11.</p><p>Like fine shadings within a given flavor, fuzzy &quot;border regions&quot; of<br/>transitions between flavors are characteristic of the system. Regular<br/>tunings with fifths at around 703 cents (roughly 1 cent wide), for<br/>example, might share qualities of both the 3- and 11-flavors; while<br/>such tunings with fifths at around 705 cents (roughly 3 cents wide)<br/>might likewise be transitional between the 11- and 23-flavors.</p><p>The different flavors and shadings differ not only the sizes of<br/>vertical intervals and tunings of most proximal quads, the latter<br/>shown in rounded cents for some sample tuning systems, but also in the<br/>sizes of cadential whole-tones (T) and semitones (S).</p><p>As we move from the 3-flavor to the 13-flavor, expansive intervals of<br/>the most proximal quad (M2, M3, M6 in M2-4, M3-5, M6-8) become larger,<br/>while contractive intervals (m3 and m7 in m3-1, m7-5) become smaller.<br/>At the same time, cadential whole-tones become larger while semitones<br/>become yet narrower and more compact.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>2.1. Differing flavors between and within tuning systems<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Distinctions between flavors may arise in basically two ways: between<br/>different neo-Gothic tuning systems, and within a single tuning<br/>system. Let us consider these two forms of variation, both illustrated<br/>on the chart.</p><p>Focusing on variations between tuning systems, we find that the<br/>spectrum of flavors correlates closely for the most part with the<br/>continuum of regular neo-Gothic tunings. Glancing at the chart, we see<br/>that Pythagorean exemplifies the 3-flavor; a tuning such as the &quot;Noble<br/>Fifth&quot; temperament, the 11-flavor; 17-tET, the 23-flavor; and 22-tET,<br/>the 7-flavor.</p><p>These associations involve regular diatonic intervals: M3 (three<br/>fifths up); m3 (three fourths up or fifths down); M6 (three fifths<br/>up); M2 (two fifths up); and m7 (two fourths up or fifths down).</p><p>Additionally, however, the same tuning may offer multiple flavors of<br/>the same unstable intervals and cadential progressions. With regular<br/>tunings such as Pythagorean JI or 29-tET, such variations occur when<br/>intervals such as &quot;major thirds&quot; of diverse sizes are derived from<br/>differing chains of fifths.</p><p>For example, as our chart shows, Pythagorean exemplifies the 3-flavor,<br/>but also includes a 7-flavor. In the latter option, unstable intervals<br/>of the most proximate quads are derived from chains an extra 12 fifths<br/>or fourths long, excellently approximating the characteristic 7-flavor<br/>ratios:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval     Chain      Cents     7-flavor ratio    Cents<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   M3     16 5ths up   ~431.28         9:7         ~435.08<br/>   m3     15 4ths up   ~270.67         7:6         ~266.87<br/>   M6     15 5ths up   ~929.33        12:7         ~933.13<br/>   M2     14 5ths up   ~227.37         8:7         ~231.17<br/>   m7     14 4ths up   ~972.63         7:4         ~968.83<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Similarly, as we saw in our discussion of the 11-flavor, 29-tET<br/>represents a mild variety of this flavor with regular minor thirds<br/>very close to 13:11. On the chart, however, it is listed as an example<br/>of the 13-flavor, whose characteristic ratios it superbly approximates<br/>through another arrangement of comparably long chains of fifths or<br/>fourths:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval     Chain      Cents     13-flavor ratio   Cents<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   M3     13 4ths up   ~455.17        13:10        ~454.21<br/>   m3     14 5ths up   ~248.27        15:13        ~247.74<br/>   M6     14 4ths up   ~951.72        26:15        ~952.26<br/>   M2     15 4ths up   ~248.27        15:13        ~247.74<br/>   m7     15 5ths up   ~951.72        26:15        ~952.26<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As this listing shows, the 13-flavor is a region where vertical major<br/>seconds and minor thirds have precisely or approximately the same<br/>size, and likewise major sixths and minor sevenths! We explore this<br/>striking state of affairs in the next section.</p><p>From a practical standpoint, the 7-flavor option in Pythagorean or the<br/>13-flavor option in 29-tET obviously requires a large tuning to<br/>accommodate the elongated chains of fifths. A 24-note tuning provides<br/>these altered flavors of intervals in about as many positions as their<br/>regular or &quot;native&quot; counterparts in a 12-note tuning -- precisely as<br/>many in Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Moving from the question of _how_ diverse flavors arise in a single<br/>tuning to the question of _why_ they are used, we come to a leading<br/>motivation: the amplification of directed cadential progressions.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2.2. A closer &quot;closest approach&quot;: the 7-flavor and 13-flavor<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In Part I (Section 1.2), we surveyed the usual &quot;3-flavor&quot; resolutions<br/>of most proximate quads in medieval Pythagorean tuning, a point of<br/>departure for neo-Gothic practice, noting three intonational traits:</p><p>(1) Major and minor thirds at 81:64 (~408 cents) and 32:27 (~294<br/>cents), and major sixths at 27:16 (~906 cents), have a rather complex<br/>quality which enhances a sense of directed cadential tension;</p><p>(2) There is a pleasing melodic contrast between generously large<br/>whole-tones at 9:8 (~204 cents) and compact ascending or descending<br/>semitones at 256:243 (~90 cents); and</p><p>(3) Cadential action is quite efficient and economic, with unstable<br/>intervals needing to expand (M2-4, M3-5, M6-8) or contract (m3-1,<br/>m7-5) by a total distance of only about 294 cents (equal to the size<br/>of a 32:27 minor third) in order to attain their stable goals.</p><p>All three traits, and especially (2) and (3), may be seen as aspects<br/>of a medieval and neo-Gothic cadential ethos of &quot;closest approach,&quot; in<br/>which unstable intervals should &quot;approach&quot; their stable goals as<br/>closely as possible, resolving by maximally parsimonious and efficient<br/>expansion or contraction. From a melodic viewpoint, as Mark Lindley<br/>has aptly stated, such progressions involve narrow or &quot;incisive&quot;<br/>diatonic semitones.</p><p>As we move along our continuum from the 3-flavor to the 13-flavor, as<br/>shown in the table near the beginning of this article segment (opening<br/>of Section 2), this cadential closest approach becomes yet closer.<br/>Expansive intervals become yet wider, contractive intervals yet<br/>narrower, resulting in yet more parsimonious resolutions with yet<br/>keener or more incisive melodic semitones.</p><p>To illustrate these themes, we focus here on the &quot;superefficient&quot;<br/>cadential progressions of the 7-flavor as realized in Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and the 13-flavor as realized in 29-tET.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>2.2.1. The Pythagorean 7-flavor: streamlined valleys<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, the altered cadential intervals of most<br/>proximate quads in the 7-flavor have generating chains 12 fifths or<br/>fourths longer than their usual 3-flavor counterparts (Section 2.1).<br/>This makes expanding intervals (M2, M3, M6) wider than usual by a<br/>Pythagorean comma of 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents), and contracting<br/>intervals (m3, m7) a comma narrower.</p><p>The following diagrams of standard resolutions in this 7-flavor may<br/>invite comparison with those given in Part I (Section 1.2) for the<br/>usual Pythagorean 3-flavor cadences:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/</a></p><p>Here I have used the ASCII ^ symbol to show a note raised by a comma,<br/>and the @ symbol to show a note lowered by a comma[8]:</p><p>       Expansive/Intensive                  Contractive/Intensive</p><p>     E^4 -----  +67 ----- F4                D4  ----- -204 ----- C4<br/>    (227)               (498)              (271)                 (0)<br/>     D4 ------ -204 ----- C4                B^3 -----  +67 ----- C4<br/>  (498,271)            (498,0)           (702,431)            (702,702)<br/>     B^3 -----  +67 ----- C4                G3  ----- -204 ----- F3<br/>(929,702,431)       (1200,702,702)     (973,702,271)         (702,702,0)<br/>     G3 ------ -204 ----- F3                E^3 -----  +67 ----- F3</p><p>       Expansive/Remissive                  Contractive/Remissive</p><p>     E4  ---- +204 ----- F#4               D@4 -----  -67 ----- C#4<br/>    (227)               (498)             (271)                 (0)<br/>     D@4 ----  -67 ----- C#4               B3  ----- +204 ----- C#4<br/>  (498,271)            (498,0)          (702,431)            (702,702)<br/>     B3  ---- +204 ----- C#4               G@3 -----  -67 ----- F#3<br/>(929,702,431)      (1200,702,702)     (973,702,227)         (702,702,0)<br/>     G@3 ----- -67 ----- F#3               E3  ----- +204 ----- F#3</p><p>In comparing these progressions with the usual 3-flavor ones, we might<br/>first note what has _not_ changed. All fifths and fourths, in unstable<br/>quads as well as stable trines, remain pure; and melodic whole-tones<br/>remain at a pure 9:8 (~204 cents).</p><p>Cadential semitones, however, have shrunk from around 90 cents to a<br/>&quot;supercompact&quot; 67 cents -- more precisely 66.76 cents, the difference<br/>being equal to the Pythagorean comma.</p><p>From a vertical perspective, expansive unstable intervals have become<br/>a comma larger, and contractive intervals a comma smaller, thus<br/>reducing the total motion required for their resolution to stability<br/>from around 294 cents to 271 cents, the size of the Pythagorean<br/>7-flavor minor third (e.g. B3-D@3 or E3-G@3).</p><p>Thus these progressions offer a very impressive accentuation of the<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; ideal while retaining just intonation for the<br/>stable concords, 3:2 fifths and 4:3 fourths.</p><p>At the same time, intriguingly, this intensified and &quot;superefficient&quot;<br/>7-flavor cadential action may actually produce simpler and more<br/>&quot;consonant&quot; ratios for the expansive and contractive quads than the<br/>usual 3-flavor tuning. In the 7-flavor, these quads are very close<br/>respectively to 14:18:21:24 and 12:14:18:21, while in the 3-flavor<br/>they have more complex ratios of 64:81:96:108 and 54:64:81:96.</p><p>To use the terms of harmonic entropy or consonance/dissonance<br/>theorists such as Paul Erlich and David Keenan, unstable 7-flavor<br/>intervals are in the &quot;valley&quot; regions of 8:7 (M2), 7:6 (m3), 9:7 (M3),<br/>12:7 (M6), and 7:4 (m7), differing from these ratios by only about<br/>3.80 cents. Their usual Pythagorean 3-flavor counterparts other than<br/>M2 at 9:8, in contrast, are in &quot;plateau&quot; regions of somewhat greater<br/>complexity between such simple valley ratios.</p><p>Thus if one set out to optimize the &quot;closest approach&quot; ideal (narrow<br/>cadential semitones, minimal distance of expansion or contraction),<br/>and at the same time to maximize the simplicity or &quot;consonance&quot; of<br/>unstable quads as well as stable trines, the Pythagorean 7-flavor<br/>would seem a near-ideal solution.</p><p>Both the efficiency of these resolutions and the simplicity of the<br/>unstable quads lend to the 7-flavor a certain &quot;streamlined&quot; quality:<br/>the contractive quad, especially, can be quite &quot;mellow,&quot; while the<br/>expansive quad is, not so surprisingly, rather more outgoing.</p><p>In short, the Pythagorean 7-flavor seems to have these features:</p><p>(1) Unstable most proximate quads actually have simpler ratios,<br/>~14:18:21:24 (expansive) and ~12:14:18:21 (contractive), than in the<br/>usual 3-flavor, making them somewhat &quot;smoother,&quot; but still decidedly<br/>more complex than a stable 2:3:4 trine, so that the dynamic tension is<br/>still sufficient to impel superb cadential action;</p><p>(2) While melodic whole-tones remain at 9:8 (~204 cents), cadential<br/>semitones shrink from around 90 cents to a superkeen 67 cents,<br/>heightening the contrast between these steps; and</p><p>(3) The total amount of expansion or contraction required in two-voice<br/>resolutions also shrinks from an already efficient 294 cents to a<br/>superefficient 271 cents, contributing along with the simpler &quot;valley&quot;<br/>ratios for the unstable quads to a &quot;streamlined&quot; impression for these<br/>7-flavor cadences.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>2.2.2. The 13-flavor in 29-tET: an impressive summit<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Carrying the themes of superwide expansive intervals, supercompact<br/>contractive ones, and extra-narrow cadential semitones a step further,<br/>we arrive at a &quot;13-flavor&quot; where major and minor thirds have ratios at<br/>or near 13:10 (~454 cents) and 15:13 (~248 cents).</p><p>In the regular tuning of 29-tET, these strikingly impressive cadences<br/>are combined with near-pure fifths and fourths.

The &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning is defined as having a fifth equal to the<br/>Phi-based &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; between 4/7-octave (7-tET) and 3/5-octave<br/>(5-tET), weighted toward the latter. That is, the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; of<br/>this tuning is equal to the octave fraction (4 + 3 Phi)/(7 + 5 Phi),<br/>or about 704.096 cents. Phi is the &quot;Golden Ratio&quot; of ~1.61803. As<br/>Keenan Pepper noted in describing this tuning, it is a counterpart to<br/>Thorwald Kornerup&apos;s &quot;Golden Meantone&quot; with a fifth equal to the octave<br/>fraction (3 + 4 Phi)/(5 + 7 Phi).</p><p>7. The &quot;e-based&quot; tuning has a ratio between the whole-tone and<br/>diatonic semitone equal to Euler&apos;s _e_, ~2.71828, producing a fifth of<br/>about 704.609 cents.</p><p>8. In a 24-note Pythagorean arrangement with two 12-note keyboards<br/>tuned with identical intervals, but a Pythagorean comma apart -- the<br/>Xeno-Gothic system -- we could assign a fixed note name to each key,<br/>producing somewhat different spellings for some of these resolutions.<br/>For example, suppose we take the lower-pitch keyboard as the &quot;usual&quot;<br/>one. Then the spelling for intensive resolutions would remain as<br/>shown; remissive resolutions would be G3-B^3-D4-E^4 to F#^3-C#^4-F#^4<br/>(expansive) and E^3-G3-B^3-D4 to F#^3-C#^4 (contractive). More<br/>generally, in such 24-note schemes with two manuals, intensive<br/>progressions resolve to stable sonorities on the lower manual, and<br/>remissive progressions to sonorities on the upper manual.</p><p>9. In a tuning of 24-out-of-29-tET mapped to two 12-note keyboards a<br/>diesis apart, with the lower-pitched keyboard taken as the &quot;usual&quot; one<br/>(compare n. 8), the remissive progressions would have the spellings<br/>G3-B*3-D4-E*4 to F#*3-C#*4-F#*4 (expansive) and E*3-G3-B*3-D4 to<br/>F#*3-C#*4 (contractive).</p><p>10. In a 24-note tuning analogous to that of nn. 8-9, with two<br/>keyboards a diesis apart (~49.15 cents) and the lower-pitched keyboard<br/>taken as the &quot;usual&quot; one, the spellings would be the same as in 29-tET<br/>(n. 9).</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
