An article<br/>in the Scotsman daily newspaper reports that archaeologists have found<br/>what they believe to be the world&apos;s oldest written music - and it is a<br/>love song. Czech archaeologists found the song adorning the tomb of an<br/>important nobleman in the dunes south west of Cairo. The tomb dates back<br/>to the reign of Pepi during the 6th Dynasty and was built for a judge<br/>named Inti.</p><p>The newly discovered love song is thought to be 900 years older than the<br/>earliest known written music which is 3400 years old and of Syrian<br/>origin.</p><p>The article concentrates mainly on the lyrics though it is implied that<br/>there is some form of musical notation. Interested parties might like to<br/>email the journalist who wrote the article at <a href="mailto:acrawford@scotsman.com">acrawford@scotsman.com</a> .</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2000 6:58:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Alison Monteith wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15965">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15965</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The newly discovered love song is thought to be 900 years older<br/>&gt; than the earliest known written music which is 3400 years old<br/>&gt; and of Syrian origin.</p><p>Thanks for the info on this new discovery, Alison.  Note that<br/>I believe that a Babylonian tablet a few hundred years older<br/>than the Syrian (Hurrian) hymn is not simply a &apos;tuning text&apos;,<br/>but actually a kind of &apos;lyre etude&apos;, and thus an older<br/>musical score.</p><p>Check the archives from around September-October for more<br/>details.
