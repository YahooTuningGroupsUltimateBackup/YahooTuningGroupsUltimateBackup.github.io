Whether or not I agree with him is immaterial...when a person develops their own theories, writes about them, prints a book at their own expense..more power to them. I think there&apos;s a wide wide range of possible tunings, of course...it&apos;s the music produced by those theories that interests me more. And that involves much more than just the placement of the notes in a tuning system...compositional skills certainly are very important, as is arranging, technical abilities to express the musical ideas, tone color, and ultimately, the depth of expression.</p><p>   And even if one disagrees with a person&apos;s theories, it&apos;s important to do so with respect. I am fine with John, or anyone else, talking about their books/CD&apos;s/etc here....I may find out about something of interest. But...as usual, there are folks on this list who seem to be what I would call, for lack of a better term, sorta mean spirited...they cannot state their views without snide remarks, a touch of smugness, or plain anger...wish they would actually resign, cause music is about sharing ideas, and learning from each other...not trying to dominate others...best from cloudy Denver...Stickman   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a></p></div>
