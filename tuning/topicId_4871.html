Maybe there will be scalpers outside with tickets to sell!  How many people does the hall hold?  Actually, it will probably be the same concert.  I&apos;d guess this music takes a lot of rehearsal time.<br/>In talking to Dean Drummond after the concert, I expressed my astonsihment that he would have put music by Partch and Cage on the same CD, as Partch&apos;s opinion of the latter was summed up in one word, &quot;precious&quot;.  I think that really sums it up neatly.  But they both did some pieces which were rather &quot;tongue in cheek&quot;, so they had that in common.  Actually, I don&apos;t recall that Cage did anything else.<br/>But I believe Cage worked mostly in the New York City area, where what he did would be considered curious and interesting.  Harry lived and worked mostly in California, where what he did was perhaps considered closer to normal and average.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Jonathan M.

Cage&apos;s music was available on commercial, if minor, labels long before Partch&apos;s was.  The one that comes to mind is Dial, from before stereo.  I could be wrong.  They used to do some of the atonalists:  Schoenberg, Berg and Webern.  Of course, one needs the freedom from hiss, ticks and pops of CD&apos;s to do justice to 4:44.  WNYC, the non-profit station in NYC used to (and still does) a festival of American composers every February, and one could hear lots of things that you couldn&apos;t buy in stores.  I first heard part of one of Partch&apos;s private issue LP&apos;s in the early &apos;50&apos;s on their &quot;Adventures in Music&quot; which ran weekdays from 5:00 to 5:30.  So I wrote to get his address, and the liner notes on &quot;Plectra and Percussioin Dances&quot; clued me in to his book, which I had a store order from the University of Wisconsin Press.  It was only $10, probably the most expensive book I&apos;d ever bought at that time.  The current paperback edition is more.
