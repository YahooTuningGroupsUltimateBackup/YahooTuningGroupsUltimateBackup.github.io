Then you<br/>can use the second row to zero out the second entry from the first and third<br/>rows and then finally use the third row to zero out the third entry of the<br/>first and second rows. If you need more details, look for Gauss elimination<br/>on some basic math web sites and you should find some hits.</p><p>David Bowen</p><p>2009/9/21 Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi tuners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope someone here can give me a clue for answering this question.

(I know how I&apos;d do it,<br/>&gt; but am interested in how you did it)</p><p>Well, it depends on the method I decide to use. For this particular case, I started with a chord of 2:3:5:7:9 and I was subtracting smaller interval sizes from the larger ones until I got to the four I mentioned. So if, for example, 5/3 is the largest one and you &quot;destroy it&quot; with 3/2 (i.e. you subtract the size of 3/2 from that), then there are two 3/2s, one 7/5, one 9/7, and one 10/9. And if you go on doing this further and further, you can eventually get the small interval of 4375/4374, which is what I did.</p><p>But a completely different way is if the starting point is the interval which is tempered out rather than a chord. Then you can easily get the mapping from the prime exponents of this small interval .</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2009 8:34:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...
