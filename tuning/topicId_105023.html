I&apos;d like to spend just<br/>a few minutes discussing three temperaments that are similar because they<br/>do &quot;the same things&quot; with different tones, and thus need to temper out<br/>different commas.</p><p>Naturally, this will all be stuff that probably seems really obvious to<br/>people who have been doing this for a while, but that took time to &quot;click&quot;<br/>with me. I&apos;m writing it in the hope that some newbies will understand some<br/>of the reasons to temper specific commas, and what effects that tempering<br/>can have.</p><p>-----<br/>Syntonic Comma, 81/80, | -4 4 -1 &gt;<br/>-----</p><p>Meantone is one of the traditional temperaments of Western music, and is<br/>defined by two things:<br/>1. It tempers out the comma 81/80, and<br/>2. It has a period of an octave and a generator of 3/2.<br/>I can say this with some confidence because, for reasons I don&apos;t<br/>understand, that information has been encapsulated in the &quot;wedgie&quot; (wedge<br/>product) of the comma, and people who know the math better than I do have<br/>said so.</p><p>Tempering out 81/80 means something very important in relation to the<br/>generator: It means that four stacked 3/2s (octave equivalent) = 5/4. In<br/>traditional musical terms, that&apos;s the same as saying that four fifths<br/>equals a major third.</p><p>That&apos;s good if you want 5-limit harmonies in relatively small scale sizes<br/>-- if it took, say, eight fifths to get to a major third, then you&apos;d need<br/>much larger scales to get the gamut of notes needed for 5-limit harmony.<br/>(This is related to &quot;complexity&quot;.)</p><p>Four stacked 3/2s = (3/2)^4 = 81/16, which is octave-equivalent to 81/64,<br/>which is about 407 cents -- sharper than 5/4, which is 386 cents. You get<br/>the difference by dividing (81/64)/(5/4) = 81/80. In monzo form, that&apos;s |<br/>-4 4 -1 &gt;.</p><p>This has other implications, too:</p><p>1. The first two generator steps takes you to (3/2)*(3/2) = 9/8. The<br/>difference between 5/4 and 9/8 is (5/4)/(9/8) = 10/9. But to get to 5/4,<br/>you&apos;re just taking two more generator steps, which is another 9/8. So it&apos;s<br/>easy to see that the generation process enforces the rule that, in this<br/>temperament, 9/8 = 10/9. (And what&apos;s the difference between 9/8 and 10/9?<br/>Of course: 81/80.) It&apos;s also easy to see that 5/4 is made of two equal<br/>steps of 9/8 (or 10/9).</p><p>2. 81/64 is sharper than 5/4. We got there by taking four generator steps<br/>of a fifth each. In order to bend the 81/64 down toward 5/4, we need to<br/>flatten the fifths that we&apos;re using as a generator. The implication is<br/>that, in meantone, the fifth will always be flatter than a just 3/2 and the<br/>major third will be sharper than or equal to 5/4. (It&apos;s possible to do the<br/>math so that these things aren&apos;t true, but then you&apos;re just making the<br/>tuning worse.)</p><p>3. The minor third in this case is 6/5, because 3/2 = (5/4)*(6/5). Since<br/>fifths are flat of 3/2, and major thirds are sharp of 5/4, there&apos;s less<br/>space for the minor thirds to squeeze into; they&apos;re always going to be<br/>somewhat flat.</p><p>4. This temperament has a specific scale structure. It has MOSs at 7 and 12<br/>tones; these MOSs have the familiar Western diatonic modal patterns (Ionian<br/>/ major, Aeolian / minor, Phrygian is a minor with a flat 2nd, Lydian is a<br/>major with a sharp 4th, major sevenths on the I and IV chords, major chord<br/>with a flat seventh on the V chord, etc.).</p><p>-----<br/>Archytas&apos; Comma, 64/63, | 6 -2 0 -1 &gt;<br/>-----</p><p>Let&apos;s do the same thing as we just did with meantone, only instead of a 5/4<br/>major third, let&apos;s use a spicy, 435-cent 9/7 major third.</p><p>Four 3/2s still equals 81/64, but now our major third is 9/7, which is<br/>significantly sharper than 81/64.</p><p>The difference between them is (9/7)/(81/64) = 64/63. Tempering out 64/63<br/>means that four stacked 3/2s once again equals a (9/7) major third.</p><p>The major third is once again composed of two equal steps. This time,<br/>though, the steps equate to both 9/8 and 8/7. (8/7)/(9/8) = 64/63.</p><p>Because the major third is sharper than 81/64, we have to sharpen the fifth<br/>that we&apos;re using as a generator. The major third will always be flatter<br/>than or equal to a just 9/7, and the fifth will always be sharper than a<br/>just 3/2. The minor third is (3/2)/(9/7) = 7/6. The fifth is pretty sharp<br/>and the major third is flat, so the minor third has to be sharp of 7/6.</p><p>Finally, this temperament also has the scale structure of meantone: MOSs at<br/>7 and 12 tones with Western diatonic modal patterns. As a result,<br/>everything you&apos;re used to -- I-IV-V7 progressions, ii-V-I turnarounds,<br/>minor keys, and so on -- will work, period.</p><p>-----<br/>Pentacircle, 896/891, | 7 -4 0 1 -1 &gt;<br/>-----</p><p>One more time, but with a major third of 14/11, which is about 418 cents.</p><p>Four 3/2s still equals 81/64, which is about 10 cents flat of 14/11. Our<br/>fifths are going to have to be a little sharp to compensate, but not as<br/>sharp as they were with 64/63.</p><p>(14/11)/(81/64) = 896/891. Tempering out 896/891 means four stacked 3/2s<br/>equals a (14/11) major third.</p><p>The major third is once again composed of two equal steps. This time, the<br/>steps equate to both 9/8 and 112/99. (Yeah, I wouldn&apos;t have expected that,<br/>either, but that&apos;s where the math leads. It&apos;s about 214 cents.)</p><p>The major third is slightly sharper than 81/64, so we have to slightly<br/>sharpen the fifth we use as a generator. Our major thirds will be equal to<br/>or flatter than 14/11.</p><p>Here&apos;s an interesting twist: The minor third isn&apos;t a simple ratio. The<br/>difference between 3/2 and 5/4 is 6/5; the difference between 3/2 and 9/7<br/>is 7/6; but the difference between 3/2 and 14/11 is 33/28.</p><p>But pentacircle, even though it&apos;s an 11-limit comma, can be factored into<br/>two 13-limit superparticular commas: 364/363, which is | 2 -1 0 1 -2 1 &gt;,<br/>and 352/351, which is | 5 -3 0 0 1 -1 &gt;. (Notice that the exponents of 13<br/>cancel out when you add them.)</p><p>364/363 is the difference between (14/11)*(13/11) and 3/2. If pentacircle<br/>and 364/363 are both tempered out -- which means, of course, that 352/351<br/>is also tempered out -- then 14/11 is the major third, 13/11 is the minor<br/>third, and a major third stacked on a minor third equals a perfect fifth.</p><p>The 14/11 major third will always be a little flat. The fifth will always<br/>be a little sharp. I&apos;m not sure of precisely what the minor third will be<br/>-- someone else may know.</p><p>Finally, this temperament -- with pentacircle *and* 364/363 and 352/351<br/>tempered out -- also has the diatonic scale structure of meantone: MOSs at<br/>7 and 12 tones with Western modal patterns.</p><p>-----<br/>Conclusion<br/>-----</p><p>Though we generally think of temperament families as related by their<br/>commas, I&apos;ve described one way in which different commas can be used to get<br/>similar scale structures. The scales differ primarily by the types of<br/>intervals being used, which will cause each to have a different tonal<br/>&quot;flavor&quot;. In the case of these temperaments, which are similar to meantone,<br/>people who want to experiment with different types of intervals can do so<br/>without losing the distinctive structural characteristics of chord<br/>progressions and scales that they&apos;re used to.</p><p>I anticipate that other temperament groups -- &quot;clans&quot; and &quot;families&quot; are<br/>taken, perhaps &quot;societies&quot;? -- can be found that enable people to, say,<br/>transfer their expertise from porcupine to other temperaments that have<br/>similar structures, but with different tonal flavors.</p><p>And yes, I&apos;m sure plenty of you know this already, but I&apos;m pretty happy to<br/>have figured it out. :)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=105024 href="#105024">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2012 3:15:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks - that was very clear!</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Oct 9, 2012 at 9:25 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most discussions of tunings on this list seem to deal with temperament<br/>&gt; families that are related by having the same commas.

The implication is<br/>&gt; that, in meantone, the fifth will always be flatter than a just 3/2 and the<br/>&gt; major third will be sharper than or equal to 5/4. (It&apos;s possible to do the<br/>&gt; math so that these things aren&apos;t true, but then you&apos;re just making the<br/>&gt; tuning worse.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. The minor third in this case is 6/5, because 3/2 = (5/4)*(6/5). Since<br/>&gt; fifths are flat of 3/2, and major thirds are sharp of 5/4, there&apos;s less<br/>&gt; space for the minor thirds to squeeze into; they&apos;re always going to be<br/>&gt; somewhat flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. This temperament has a specific scale structure. It has MOSs at 7 and 12<br/>&gt; tones; these MOSs have the familiar Western diatonic modal patterns (Ionian<br/>&gt; / major, Aeolian / minor, Phrygian is a minor with a flat 2nd, Lydian is a<br/>&gt; major with a sharp 4th, major sevenths on the I and IV chords, major chord<br/>&gt; with a flat seventh on the V chord, etc.).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; Archytas&apos; Comma, 64/63, | 6 -2 0 -1 &gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s do the same thing as we just did with meantone, only instead of a 5/4<br/>&gt; major third, let&apos;s use a spicy, 435-cent 9/7 major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Four 3/2s still equals 81/64, but now our major third is 9/7, which is<br/>&gt; significantly sharper than 81/64.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference between them is (9/7)/(81/64) = 64/63. Tempering out 64/63<br/>&gt; means that four stacked 3/2s once again equals a (9/7) major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The major third is once again composed of two equal steps. This time,<br/>&gt; though, the steps equate to both 9/8 and 8/7. (8/7)/(9/8) = 64/63.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because the major third is sharper than 81/64, we have to sharpen the fifth<br/>&gt; that we&apos;re using as a generator. The major third will always be flatter<br/>&gt; than or equal to a just 9/7, and the fifth will always be sharper than a<br/>&gt; just 3/2. The minor third is (3/2)/(9/7) = 7/6. The fifth is pretty sharp<br/>&gt; and the major third is flat, so the minor third has to be sharp of 7/6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, this temperament also has the scale structure of meantone: MOSs at<br/>&gt; 7 and 12 tones with Western diatonic modal patterns. As a result,<br/>&gt; everything you&apos;re used to -- I-IV-V7 progressions, ii-V-I turnarounds,<br/>&gt; minor keys, and so on -- will work, period.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; Pentacircle, 896/891, | 7 -4 0 1 -1 &gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One more time, but with a major third of 14/11, which is about 418 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Four 3/2s still equals 81/64, which is about 10 cents flat of 14/11. Our<br/>&gt; fifths are going to have to be a little sharp to compensate, but not as<br/>&gt; sharp as they were with 64/63.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (14/11)/(81/64) = 896/891. Tempering out 896/891 means four stacked 3/2s<br/>&gt; equals a (14/11) major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The major third is once again composed of two equal steps. This time, the<br/>&gt; steps equate to both 9/8 and 112/99. (Yeah, I wouldn&apos;t have expected that,<br/>&gt; either, but that&apos;s where the math leads. It&apos;s about 214 cents.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The major third is slightly sharper than 81/64, so we have to slightly<br/>&gt; sharpen the fifth we use as a generator. Our major thirds will be equal to<br/>&gt; or flatter than 14/11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s an interesting twist: The minor third isn&apos;t a simple ratio. The<br/>&gt; difference between 3/2 and 5/4 is 6/5; the difference between 3/2 and 9/7<br/>&gt; is 7/6; but the difference between 3/2 and 14/11 is 33/28.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But pentacircle, even though it&apos;s an 11-limit comma, can be factored into<br/>&gt; two 13-limit superparticular commas: 364/363, which is | 2 -1 0 1 -2 1 &gt;,<br/>&gt; and 352/351, which is | 5 -3 0 0 1 -1 &gt;. (Notice that the exponents of 13<br/>&gt; cancel out when you add them.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 364/363 is the difference between (14/11)*(13/11) and 3/2. If pentacircle<br/>&gt; and 364/363 are both tempered out -- which means, of course, that 352/351<br/>&gt; is also tempered out -- then 14/11 is the major third, 13/11 is the minor<br/>&gt; third, and a major third stacked on a minor third equals a perfect fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 14/11 major third will always be a little flat. The fifth will always<br/>&gt; be a little sharp. I&apos;m not sure of precisely what the minor third will be<br/>&gt; -- someone else may know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, this temperament -- with pentacircle *and* 364/363 and 352/351<br/>&gt; tempered out -- also has the diatonic scale structure of meantone: MOSs at<br/>&gt; 7 and 12 tones with Western modal patterns.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; Conclusion<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though we generally think of temperament families as related by their<br/>&gt; commas, I&apos;ve described one way in which different commas can be used to get<br/>&gt; similar scale structures. The scales differ primarily by the types of<br/>&gt; intervals being used, which will cause each to have a different tonal<br/>&gt; &quot;flavor&quot;. In the case of these temperaments, which are similar to meantone,<br/>&gt; people who want to experiment with different types of intervals can do so<br/>&gt; without losing the distinctive structural characteristics of chord<br/>&gt; progressions and scales that they&apos;re used to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I anticipate that other temperament groups -- &quot;clans&quot; and &quot;families&quot; are<br/>&gt; taken, perhaps &quot;societies&quot;? -- can be found that enable people to, say,<br/>&gt; transfer their expertise from porcupine to other temperaments that have<br/>&gt; similar structures, but with different tonal flavors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And yes, I&apos;m sure plenty of you know this already, but I&apos;m pretty happy to<br/>&gt; have figured it out. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Jake<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=105026 href="#105026">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2012 6:30:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Kalle, I&apos;ll check it out.

That is a rank 3 ?</p><p>No, harmonic minor is another MODMOS of meantone, which is a rank-2 temperament.</p><p>Harmonic minor is msmmsLs, so if s, m, and L were all *incommensurate* intervals (which means basically that they&apos;re &quot;random&quot; numbers that have nothing to do with each other), then it would be rank-3. But in meantone harmonic minor, they&apos;re not incommensurate; they satisfy the simple equation L + s = 2m. That equation implies that every interval in the scale can be derived from only two generators (one of which is usually called the &quot;period&quot;); it&apos;s not necessary to have three different generators. Therefore it&apos;s rank-2, not rank-3.</p><p>So, to summarize the situation:</p><p>A scale that&apos;s msmmsLs, where s, m, and L are all incommensurate intervals, is rank-3, but this is not what is usually meant by &quot;harmonic minor&quot;.</p><p>A scale that&apos;s msmmsLs, where L + s = 2m, but s and m are incommensurate, is rank-2. An example of this would be harmonic minor in quarter-comma meantone.</p><p>A scale that&apos;s msmmsLs, but where s, m, and L are all integer multiples of a single step, is rank-1. For example, if m=2s and L=3s, then this is a subset of 12edo (2 1 2 2 1 3 1) - and that&apos;s what most non-XA people think of as &quot;harmonic minor&quot;.</p><p>If you ask me personally what rank I think &quot;harmonic minor&quot; is, I say rank-2, because it&apos;s musically essential that it be a subset of meantone temperament, but it&apos;s not essential that it be a subset of an equal temperament.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=105032 href="#105032">ðŸ”—</a>kraiggrady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2012 4:22:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It is for this reason the idea of &apos;ranks&apos; does do seem fruitful and easily leads to a misconception and to overlook the work under ones nose.

If you want to play<br/>meantone chromatic melodies over some chord progression, you&apos;re going<br/>to pick a chromatic scale that has Ab over the Fm and G# over the<br/>Emaj, which would have to involve a mode shift of the meantone[12]<br/>background, because otherwise the notes will clash. So your only<br/>option is to shift the mode of meantone[12] that you&apos;re using<br/>dynamically, or play some 19-tone enharmonic melody instead.</p><p>The thing I&apos;m talking about above is just a variant of that for rank-3<br/>scales. I&apos;m not even sure how it&apos;s possible to improvise something<br/>with that approach, given the practical restrictions we all currently<br/>have on playing.

Does &quot;penta&quot; refer to the fifths tempered gently in the<br/>wide direction?</p><p>&gt;  Four 3/2s still equals 81/64, which is about 10 cents flat of<br/>&gt;  14/11. Our fifths are going to have to be a little sharp to<br/>&gt;  compensate, but not as sharp as they were with 64/63.</p><p>A good practical observation I&apos;ll add here as a medievalist is that<br/>this kind of temperament fits best in styles where 81/64 would make<br/>sense, or more generally a wide variety of major third rather than 5/4<br/>or something reasonably close. Much medieval European music of the<br/>13th-14th centuries fits, and also lots of Near Eastern music favoring<br/>major thirds around 81/64 or a bit larger.</p><p>At least in usual harmonic timbres, I wouldn&apos;t associate this style of<br/>tuning with European music of the 15th-19th centuries and similar<br/>genres presuming stable major thirds reasonably close to 5/4. This is<br/>a different world, and an equally beautiful one.</p><p>For an excellent introduction to this world by George Secor which<br/>focuses on his 17-tone well-temperament, but is equally relevant to<br/>Pentacircle (which the more remote part of his 17-note system uses,<br/>with pure 14/11 thirds), see:</p><p>          &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>For Aaron Johnson&apos;s wonderful rendition of _Le Greygnour Bien_ by<br/>Matteo de Perugia in a late 14th-century style, listen to</p><p>         &lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/greygnour.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/greygnour.ogg</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; (14/11)/(81/64) = 896/891. Tempering out 896/891 means four stacked<br/>&gt;  3/2s equals a (14/11) major third.</p><p>&gt;  The major third is once again composed of two equal steps. This<br/>&gt;  time, the steps equate to both 9/8 and 112/99. (Yeah, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;  have expected that, either, but that&apos;s where the math leads. It&apos;s<br/>&gt;  about 214 cents.)</p><p>Yes, and following the presentation of your article, it&apos;s the same<br/>pattern as with meantone for 5/4 (9:8 plus 10:9 in JI), or an Archytan<br/>temperament for 9/7 (9:8 plus 9:7). Here we know that 14/11 is 896:891<br/>or 9.688 cents larger than 81/64 (your rounded 10 cents gives an<br/>excellent sense of the magnitude), so we need 9:8 plus another tone or<br/>major second about ten cents larger -- or 214 cents (204 + 214 = 418).<br/>That&apos;s indeed the 112/99.</p><p>The charm of this, as you nicely communicate, is that tempering out<br/>896:891 and the associated commas you discuss and we&apos;ll get to in a<br/>moment is a _much_ more forgiving problem than dealing with the 81:80<br/>or 64:63. We can have mildly tempered fifths (comparable to 12-EDO and<br/>maybe a bit closer to pure) plus a wonderful world of other intervals.</p><p>&gt;  The major third is slightly sharper than 81/64, so we have to<br/>&gt;  slightly sharpen the fifth we use as a generator. Our major thirds<br/>&gt;  will be equal to or flatter than 14/11.</p><p>This is generally quite right, but it is possible -- at the cost of<br/>some additional compromise to the fifths -- to temper 14/11 slightly<br/>on the wide side, although that&apos;s really the upper edge of the region<br/>we&apos;re talking about, which I sometimes have called &quot;the 704-cents<br/>neighborhood.&quot;</p><p>It happens in a temperament I devised in June of 2000, the &quot;e-based&quot;<br/>temperament because the ratio between the whole-tone and diatonic<br/>semitone happens be equal to Euler&apos;s e -- no special acoustical<br/>implications, just a fun way to select a shade of tempering. The fifth<br/>is 704.607 cents, and the major third 418.428 cents (0.92 cents wide<br/>of 14/11).</p><p>Nowadays my &quot;sweet spot&quot; would be around 703.711 cents, or almost a<br/>cent less; and over the last decade and a bit more, this e-based<br/>temperament has been the only &quot;Pentacircle&quot; one where the major thirds<br/>were larger than 14/11. However, if we go to 17 or especially 24 or<br/>more notes, there is an attraction here if and when we want a regular<br/>tuning with a single chain of fifths.</p><p>That advantage is that 15 fifths up is almost precisely equal to 7/4,<br/>and indeed 704.588 cents gives a just 7/4 and a regular major third at<br/>418.354 cents (0.85 cents wide).</p><p>Please understand that my purpose is just to say that such &quot;slightly<br/>wider than 14/11&quot; temperaments are out there; my leaning, much<br/>agreeing with your words, is to have 14/11 just or actually a bit<br/>narrow. But this example may help when we look at what happens with<br/>minor thirds in different shades of Pentacircle temperament.</p><p>&gt;  Here&apos;s an interesting twist: The minor third isn&apos;t a simple<br/>&gt;  ratio. The difference between 3/2 and 5/4 is 6/5; the difference<br/>&gt;  between 3/2 and 9/7 is 7/6; but the difference between 3/2 and<br/>&gt;  14/11 is 33/28.</p><p>An important point! And the other side of this is that if we had a<br/>pure fifth and 13/11 pure, then we&apos;d get a major third at 33/26 or<br/>412.745 cents.</p><p>&gt;  But pentacircle, even though it&apos;s an 11-limit comma, can be<br/>&gt;  factored into two 13-limit superparticular commas: 364/363, which<br/>&gt;  is | 2 -1 0 1 -2 1 &gt;, and 352/351, which is | 5 -3 0 0 1 -1<br/>&gt;  (Notice that the exponents of 13 cancel out when you add them.)</p><p>&gt;  364/363 is the difference between (14/11)*(13/11) and 3/2. If<br/>&gt;  pentacircle and 364/363 are both tempered out -- which means, of<br/>&gt;  course, that 352/351 is also tempered out -- then 14/11 is the<br/>&gt;  major third, 13/11 is the minor third, and a major third stacked on<br/>&gt;  a minor third equals a perfect fifth.</p><p>This is a nice presentation of the general situation; and I suspect<br/>that we often tend to think of 14/11 and 13/11 more than 33/26 or<br/>33/28 simply because they are simpler ratios. Also, from a melodic<br/>point of view, the difference between 13/11 and 14/11 is a beautiful<br/>small neutral second of 14/13 (128.298 cents), that shows up in these<br/>temperaments as the chromatic semitone, e.g. Eb-E (with C-Eb around<br/>13/11 and C-E around 14/11).</p><p>Incidentally, there is a style of tuning which can demonstrate these<br/>small commas or kleismas or whatever at 352:351 and 364:363 and how<br/>they add up to 896:891; but I&apos;ll save that for the end, because it&apos;s a<br/>bit of a diversion from our main topic of regular or near-regular<br/>temperament.</p><p>&gt;  The 14/11 major third will always be a little flat. The fifth will<br/>&gt;  always be a little sharp. I&apos;m not sure of precisely what the minor<br/>&gt;  third will be -- someone else may know.</p><p>Here the answer is that different shadings of Pentacircle will give us<br/>different sizes of major and minor thirds, with the size of the<br/>gently widened fifth also part of the equation.</p><p>For example, near the lower end of this Pentacircle region, let&apos;s<br/>consider George Secor&apos;s HTT or High Tolerance Temperament family of<br/>tunings with a generator of 703.579 cents, which he selected to<br/>optimize lots of different ratios.</p><p>Our major third is 414.315 cents. That&apos;s rather closer to 33/26 (1.569<br/>cents wide) than 14/11 (3.193 cents narrow) -- as you observe, the<br/>difference between these ratios is 364/363 or 4.763 cents. So Secor&apos;s<br/>major third is about a third of the way from 33/26 to 14/11.</p><p>His minor third at 289.264 cents is a virtual just 13/11 (289.210<br/>cents). So we could say that his Pentacircle shading is closest to<br/>13/11 and 33/26, but still gives a reasonable approximation for 14/11<br/>also. This temperament, by the way, is almost identical with<br/>(352/351)^(1/3) where 13/11 would be precisely just, and 33/26 wide by<br/>the same amount as the fifth (1.642 cents).</p><p>As it happens, my own favorite shading of this temperament is MET-24<br/>(&quot;Milder Extended Temperament&quot; -- although not quite so mild as<br/>Secor&apos;s!) with the fifths averaging at 703.711 cents. I say<br/>&quot;averaging,&quot; because my Yamaha TX-802 at 1024-EDO implements this by<br/>tuning alternating fifths at 703.125 and 704.297 cents, which I<br/>actually prefer; but synths with finer resolutions could simply tune<br/>all the regular fifths at 703.711 cents.</p><p>Here the major third is 414.844 cents, or 2.664 cents narrow of 14/11,<br/>and 2.098 cents wide of 33/26, to which we&apos;re still a bit closer.<br/>As with Secor&apos;s shading, we can think of this tempered third as<br/>representing both ratios.</p><p>The minor third in my 1024-EDO version is 288.281 cents or 289.453<br/>cents, the former not quite a cent (0.928 cents) narrow of 13/11, and<br/>the latter wide by 0.234 cents. Here, as with Secor&apos;s HTT family, we<br/>have a near-just 13/11 almost a full 364:363 from 33/28 (284.447<br/>cents).</p><p>Now let&apos;s move up to Keenan Pepper&apos;s &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; at 704.096 cents,<br/>defining the temperament he announced in September of 2000. In terms<br/>of a tradeoff between 13/11 and 14/11, this is about as optimized as<br/>they come. The major third at 416.382 cents is about 1.126 cents<br/>narrow of 14/11, and clearly much closer to this than to 33/26.</p><p>The minor third likewise is at 287.713 cents, or 1.497 cents narrow of<br/>13/11 -- still within 1.5 cents of just, and 3.266 cents wide of<br/>33/28.</p><p>With both 13/11 and 14/11 this close to just, we might expect to get a<br/>near-just 14/13 step -- and we do, at 128.669 cents, just 0.371 cents<br/>wide!</p><p>So from one point of view, Pepper&apos;s tuning (defined by the ratio of<br/>Phi between the major second and near-14/13 chromatic semitone) is<br/>just about the ideal case of what you&apos;re describing: 14/11 and 13/11<br/>each just a bit narrow (no more than 1.5 cents each) and the fifth about<br/>two cents wide (here 2.141 cents).</p><p>How about a just 14/11? For that, we need a fifth of 704.377 cents,<br/>which gives us our 14/11 major third at 417.508 cents.</p><p>Now if the fifth were just, our 14/11 major third would have a 33/28<br/>minor third. Here, the 33/28 will be wider by the same amount as the<br/>fifth, or (896/891)^(1/4) -- about 2.422 cents, or 286.869 cents.<br/>This is 2.341 cents narrow of 13/11.</p><p>So, if 14/11 is pure, we get a minor third almost equally distant<br/>from 13/11 and 33/28, which could reasonably represent either.</p><p>Finally, let&apos;s quickly consider the e-based tuning at 704.607 cents,<br/>where the major third at 418.428 cents, or 0.92 cents wide of 14/11.</p><p>Here the minor third is 286.179 cents, 3.030 cents narrow of 13/11 and<br/>now only 1.732 cents wide of 33/28. So we&apos;re leaning now in the<br/>direction of 33/28, but could still consider this third as a<br/>reasonable representation of 13/11 also.</p><p>I could get more into the fine mechanism of the commas or kleismas<br/>(896:891, 352:351, and 364:363), but this may be enough to address<br/>your question and its opportunity to explore the general lay of the<br/>land a bit.</p><p>&gt;  Finally, this temperament -- with pentacircle *and* 364/363 and<br/>&gt;  352/351 tempered out -- also has the diatonic scale structure of<br/>&gt;  meantone: MOSs at 7 and 12 tones with Western modal patterns.</p><p>This is true, but I&apos;d add that the Pentacircle in 12 notes<br/>additionally has some wonderful resources for Near Eastern music which<br/>we can expand either by using a larger MOS (e.g. 17), and/or by adding<br/>another MOS chain of fifths (e.g. 12, or merrier yet with 17) at a<br/>strategically chosen distance to optimize some septimal and extra<br/>neutral ratios. For example, we add that second 12-note or 17-note<br/>chain at 58.090 cents for Secor&apos;s HTT shading, 57.422 cents for<br/>MET-24, or 58.680 cents for Peppermint.</p><p>However, let&apos;s stick to the 12-MOS. Not only do we have a great<br/>&quot;accentuated Pythagorean&quot; diatonic -- major and minor thirds near<br/>14/11 and 13/11, and diatonic semitones near 22/21.</p><p>We also get some small and large neutral intervals! The chromatic<br/>semitone is close to 14/13, and we have a small neutral third<br/>(i.e. the augmented second) somewhere around 63/52 (332.208 cents) or<br/>17/14 (336.013 cents), and large neutral third around 26/21 (369.747<br/>cents) or 21/17 (365.825 cents). There&apos;s also a diminished third<br/>(e.g. C#-Eb, or twice the diatonic semitone) which in the milder<br/>shadings like Secor&apos;s HTT or my MET-24 is quite close to 11:10<br/>(165.004 cents).</p><p>With only 12 notes, we get more of a sampler than a full set of these<br/>intervals, but it&apos;s a start! For example, if we want a bright Rast<br/>mode of the kind favored in some parts of Syria, the basic notes of<br/>the mode are there: B-C#-Eb-E-F#-G#-Bb-B. This approximates, for<br/>example, a tetrachord of 9:8-11:10-14:13 (204-165-128 cents), which<br/>interestingly would yield a fourth less than a cent narrow of pure!</p><p>From a medieval European perspective, we would have some interesting<br/>augmented and diminished intervals very nice for a colorful<br/>14th-century intonation; from a Near Eastern perspective, we have the<br/>beginnings of the vocabulary of neutral intervals and modes so central<br/>to medieval and later styles.</p><p>To enlarge on the European side of this: we get a wonderful diatonic<br/>system and set of usual accidentals for 13th-14th century polyphony<br/>and familiar cadences in three or four voices, _plus_ those neutral<br/>intervals which are great when augmented or diminished intervals do<br/>arise. Especially if we go with something like Secor&apos;s HTT or MET-24,<br/>the fifths are generally a bit closer to pure than in 12-EDO, so the<br/>Pythagorean ideal of 4:3 and 3:2 isn&apos;t too compromised.</p><p>Melodically, Pentacircle as you&apos;ve termed it generally fits some<br/>tendencies not only medieval Pythagorean intonation in Europe, but of<br/>Persian music, where there&apos;s often a tendency to tune fifths a bit<br/>larger than pure, say around 704-707 cents, with regular semitones<br/>often around 80 cents or so, and lots of freedom and variability!</p><p>Anyway, I hope this isn&apos;t getting into too much detail, but addresses<br/>some of your questions. As a medievalist, I&apos;d also emphasize along<br/>with George Secor (see my link above) that this style of tuning has<br/>its own outlook, with a structure analogous to but with typically<br/>different musical qualities and purposes than meantone with its<br/>5-limit outlook</p><p>                *           *          *</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>Note on 896:891, 352:351, 364:363, 10648:10647 ----------------------------------------------</p><p>Now for my promised aside about the 352:351, 364:363, and the 896:891<br/>which they almost equally divide (4.925 + 4.763 = 9.688 cents). By the<br/>way, the tiny inequality of the 352:351 and 364:363 gives us a fourth<br/>schisma of sorts: the 10648/10647 or harmonisma (0.163 cents).</p><p>While the Pentacircle involves a gentle tempering of the fifths by<br/>something at or often a bit less than (896/891)^1/4, there is another<br/>approach analogous in a way to unequal 12-note well-temperaments as<br/>variations on 5-limit meantone: basically a &quot;just temperament&quot;!</p><p>We can get a just 14/11 with a chain of four fifths like this:<br/>3/2-176/117-3/2-182/121.... Note that 176/117 (706.880 cents) is wide<br/>by a 352:351, while 182:121 is wide by a 364:363. So we&apos;re alternating<br/>between pure fifths and &quot;virtually tempered&quot; ones about not quite five<br/>cents wide, or very close to (896/891)^1/2.</p><p>You might note that the compromise here of the impure fifths is very<br/>close to that of 1/4-comma meantone (5.38 cents). But the contrast<br/>between the pure and tangibly impure fifths is a bit analogous to<br/>that in a colorful well-temperament like Werckmeister III!</p><p>Here&apos;s a &quot;virtual temperament&quot; of this kind in 7 notes:</p><p>! 44_39-diat1.scl<br/>!<br/>Diatonic involving 352:351 and 364:363<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 44/39<br/> 14/11<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 22/13<br/> 39/22<br/> 2/1</p><p>If we think of the 1/1 as G, this would be a variation on the medieval<br/>European Mixolydian untransposed. Note we get a 14/11 (G-B) at 896:891<br/>wider than 81/64; but also a 44/39 and 39/22 at 352:351 respectively<br/>larger or smaller than 9/8 and 16/9, and also 22/13 likewise larger<br/>than 27/16.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala program is great for showing all the<br/>intervals in this diatonic, and the interplay of the 896:891, 352:351,<br/>364:363, and 10648:10647 - all of which show up when we look at the<br/>step sizes and intervals of this basic diatonic!</p><p>Here&apos;s a similar 12-note chromatic:</p><p>! 44_39-12.scl<br/>!<br/>12-note chromatic tuning with 352:351, 364:363 (G=1/1, Eb-G#)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 14/13<br/> 44/39<br/> 13/11<br/> 14/11<br/> 4/3<br/> 56/39<br/> 3/2<br/> 11/7<br/> 22/13<br/> 39/22<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>The interesting point here is that if we&apos;re ready to live with having<br/>every other fifth as about as impure as in 1/4-comma meantone (or<br/>actually a bit less), we can have a JI system no more difficult to<br/>navigate than an unequal well-temperament -- although without<br/>circulation, not really a consideration in medieval European or Near<br/>Eastern music. I like this listing of the Scala file on G-G because<br/>there are lots of interesting symmetries, but just make the 1/1 the<br/>4/3 step (Scala command KEY 5), and we have the equivalent of a<br/>14th-century European Halberstadt keyboard with octaves of C-C and a<br/>range of Eb-G#.</p><p>! 44_39-12_C.scl<br/>!<br/>44_39-12.scl with C as 1/1 (Eb-G#)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 14/13<br/> 9/8<br/> 33/28<br/> 33/26<br/> 117/88<br/> 63/44<br/> 3/2<br/> 21/13<br/> 22/13<br/> 39/22<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>In practice, the reason I usually go with Pentacircle is simply that<br/>for most purposes I want consistently near-pure fifths -- in MET-24,<br/>either 1.170 or 2.342 cents wide.

First, Gene,<br/>here&apos;s a possible statement of the problem I think you are posing:</p><p>        Find the regular or eventone temperament for a 14/11<br/>        major third where:</p><p>        (a) The approximations of 3/2 and 14/11 (or 11/7)<br/>            are equally impure; and</p><p>        (b) The diatonic semitone or limma is a just 22/21.</p><p>The answer, of course, is specifically and uniquely 1/5-kleisma. As<br/>with other eventones -- tempering out the 81/80 (meantone) or the<br/>64/63 (Archytan) -- tempering out 1/5 of the applicable comma or<br/>kleisma or whatever gets us a temperament where the fifth and major<br/>third are equally impure, _and_ the diatonic semitone has a just<br/>ratio, e.g. 16/15 (1/5-comma meantone), 28/27 (1/5-comma Archytan), or<br/>here 22/21 (1/5-kleisma whatever).</p><p>If I&apos;m correct as to the temperament, and were trying to explain it to<br/>a newbie or anyone else, I&apos;d say that 3/2 and 14/11 are equally<br/>impure, and that 22/21 is just.</p><p>Here&apos;s a post from 2010 defining this temperament and its generator<br/>with a tempering of (896/891)^(1/5), and showing a realization on a<br/>synthesizer in 1024-EDO:</p><p>      &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_91499.html#91499">/tuning/topicId_91499.html#91499</a>&gt;</p><p>Jake, in your original post, you asked what the size of the minor<br/>third would be in the kind of temperament you were describing, meant<br/>to optimize both 14/11 and 13/11. If you meant this one defined by a<br/>just 22/21 semitone, the answer is 288.322 cents, or about 0.877 cents<br/>narrow of 13/11.</p><p>However, given your emphasis on 14/11 and 13/11 (rather than 3/2 and<br/>14/11), and a temperament called Canton I found from 2011, if I&apos;m<br/>correct, I suspect what you might mean is the temperament where 14/11<br/>and 13/11 are equally impure. Curiously, there&apos;s a quick way to<br/>calculate this.</p><p>If 14/11 and 13/11 are equally impure, then 14/13 must be just! This<br/>is the chromatic semitone of the tuning, e.g. Eb-E, with C-E a bit<br/>narrow of 14/11 and C-Eb equally narrow of 13/11.</p><p>Now a chromatic semitone or apotome is equal to 7 fifths up less four<br/>octaves, so we have a generator of (224/13)^1/7, or 704.042606 cents.<br/>The major third is 416.170 cents, or 1.338 cents narrow of 14/11; and<br/>the minor third is 287.872 cents, also 1.338 cents narrow of 13/11.</p><p>This Canton temperament, if indeed the idea is to have 14/11 and 13/11<br/>equally impure and 14/13 just, is almost identical to Keenan Pepper&apos;s<br/>Noble Fifth tuning at 704.096 cents (September 5, 2000); the<br/>difference between the fifths is 0.053 cents, or about 1/20 cent.<br/>They are distinct, however, with Pepper having a ratio between major<br/>second and chromatic semitone equal to Phi (a la Kornerup&apos;s Golden<br/>Meantone); and Canton, if I&apos;m correct, has a just 14/13.</p><p>If this is the correct definition, then I might suggest that whoever<br/>created Canton (you, Jake?) use a file like the following one for the<br/>&quot;smooth&quot; or canonical version of Canton with 14/13 just, clearly<br/>distinguishing it from the Pepper tuning. How about canton_14-13.scl<br/>for a Scala file name in the usual style with all lowercase? The only<br/>reason I haven&apos;t done this in the following file is a polite desire to<br/>let you verify that this is really Canton in its ideal form, and then<br/>adopt a file like this if you agree with my suggestion.</p><p>! 14_13-12.scl<br/>!<br/>Temperament with just 14/13 apotome, close to Pepper Noble Fifth<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 128.29824<br/> 208.08521<br/> 287.87218<br/> 416.17043<br/> 495.95739<br/> 624.25564<br/> 704.04261<br/> 832.34085<br/> 912.12782<br/> 991.91479<br/> 1120.21303<br/> 2/1</p><p>Similarly, what I&apos;d call Pentakleismic (i.e. a temperament of 1/5 of<br/>a kleisma, understood to be 896/891) should be distinguished from<br/>Canton. This can be done easily: Pentakleismic has a pure 22/21, and<br/>Canton a pure 14/13 -- respectively as the diatonic and chromatic<br/>semitones, so they&apos;re kin in that way.</p><p>In fact, why not Pentakleismic-22/21 and Canton-14/13. That identifies<br/>the unique definition of each tuning, and distinguishes both from<br/>other nearby tunings including Pepper. In Scala, given the lowercase<br/>convention and possible complications with slashes or colons in<br/>filenames, maybe pentakleismic-22_21.scl and canton-14_13.scl.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105067 href="#105067">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2012 9:17:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is something in this tuning I did tonight.

So the latter might well<br/>have a fuzzier definition.</p><p>With a pentatonic, you&apos;re not weighing the tradeoff between 11/10<br/>and 14/13 (an issue in a 12-MOS or larger system like O3), for<br/>example. It&apos;s just the idea that 3/2 and 14/11 or 11/7 are<br/>comparably impure: where there are no landmarks or constraints,<br/>why not be flexible?</p><p>In another post, I will discuss the question of mapping<br/>subregions for these undecimal/tredecimal or 14/11 and 13/11<br/>temperaments, with links to some Scala files suggesting some of<br/>these subregions: Secor&apos;s 29-HTT; MET-24; O3; Canton and the<br/>slightly more tempered Pepperment, etc.</p><p>But for Pentacenter, all this might be a bit much, rather like<br/>trying to draw exact lines for a meantone pentatonic called<br/>Pentacomma where the 3/2 and 8/5 are about equally narrow.<br/>People trying to map meantone subregions will probably look at an<br/>MOS of 12, 19, or 31, etc.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105091 href="#105091">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2012 6:57:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 21 Oct 2012, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_92309.html#92309">/tuning/topicId_92309.html#92309</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mscbulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mscbulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>The last URL is an obvious typo, and I apologize for not checking<br/>this in my mail program before posting, although the first link<br/>will get you there:</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105096 href="#105096">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2012 4:14:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Oct 21, 2012 at 9:52 PM, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And greetings to you, Mike.

As I was going to say<br/>&gt; privately, congratulations on your moderation and your service to<br/>&gt; the tuning community!</p><p>Thanks Margo, it&apos;s good to see you posting again! I note you recently<br/>wrote a post on rank-3 temperaments as well, which I have yet to check<br/>out (though I read the email linking to the longer document, and it<br/>looked like a very well-written and clear exposition on the subject).</p><p>I guess that for now, all I have to contribute is that if your goal is<br/>a chain of fifths such that 81/64 is equated with 14/11 and 32/27 is<br/>equated with 13/11, then the 2.3.14/11.13/11 temperament eliminating<br/>896/891 and 352/351 will do the trick. The TOP tuning for this<br/>temperament is &lt;1199.506 1902.738 413.917 289.315| where the values<br/>represent the tunings for 2/1, 3/1, 14/11, and 13/11 respectively.<br/>This tuning assigns to each interval n/d a weight of 1/(n*d), so that<br/>simpler intervals are weighted more strongly, and then minimizes the<br/>maximum weighted tuning error over all intervals in the lattice. The<br/>pure-octave version is &lt;1200.000 1903.522 414.088 289.434|, which<br/>makes the fifths a bit sharper.</p><p>The TE tuning, which is similar but which instead minimizes something<br/>like &quot;the average error over all intervals&quot; rather than the &quot;max error<br/>over all intervals,&quot; is &lt;1199.371 1902.859 415.207 288.280|, with the<br/>pure octave version being &lt;1200.000 1903.857 415.425 288.431|, so it&apos;s<br/>about the same.</p><p>But, to my ears, I like the slightly sharp version more, especially<br/>when it gets to around 17-EDO, where the 14/11 is tuned sharp at<br/>423.529 cents. I suspect that this is because there&apos;s no real<br/>noticeable aural effect from the interval being very close to a 13/11<br/>or 14/11 ratio, and that what I really like are slightly sharp fifths,<br/>possibly for the same reason that the ear tends to like slightly sharp<br/>octaves. So I&apos;m happy with that. However, I suspect that if I were an<br/>expert listener in 13-limit harmony, I really would care a bit about<br/>the tuning of 14/11 and 13/11, because I&apos;d be used to hearing those<br/>intervals as &quot;pieces&quot; of much larger 13-limit chords, much like we can<br/>hear the dyads in a two part invention as pieces of an implied triadic<br/>or tetradic background.</p><p>I&apos;ve gotten better at &quot;placing&quot; intervals like 11/8 and 13/8 this way,<br/>but 14/11 still sounds like a mixture between 9/7 and 5/4 to me; e.g.<br/>it sounds like it&apos;d go equally well if you turned it into 4:7:9 (with<br/>the 14/11 being like a tempered 9/7) or 4:5:6 (with the 14/11 being<br/>like a tempered 5/4). Is this a bug or a feature? (I say it&apos;s both,<br/>depending on the musical circumstance.)</p><p>Lastly, I enjoyed your Prelude above - have you tried writing<br/>something in superpyth that uses 4:6:7 triads as the basis for harmony<br/>rather than 4:5:6? I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve asked you this before, but I<br/>think it&apos;d sound really good. I know that 6:7:9 is trendier, but I<br/>think there&apos;s some magic lurking behind 4:6:7, mostly because if you<br/>double the lowest note down an octave, e.g. you do C,,-C,-C-G-Bb or<br/>something, it just becomes 1:2:4:6:7. 6:7:9, on the other hand,<br/>becomes 3:6:12:14:18, which is a bit more complex.</p><p>Anyway, my two cents,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105099 href="#105099">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2012 8:52:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Lastly, I enjoyed your Prelude above - have you tried writing<br/>&gt; something in superpyth that uses 4:6:7 triads as the basis for harmony<br/>&gt; rather than 4:5:6?</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of music in that directory, and it would be nice to have a brief listing of the tunings used.</p></div><h3><a id=105105 href="#105105">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2012 4:39:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Mike,</p><p>Please let me first offer a brief reply thanking<br/>you for your kind words about my rank-3 paper, and explain<br/>that my longer reply which follows focuses not so much<br/>on optimizing 14/11 and 13/11, where you have some really<br/>interesting ideas and tunings I&apos;ll address in another post<br/>soon.</p><p>But the purpose is gently and persuasively to put on your<br/>RMP radar screen a very important kind of 2.3.7.11.13<br/>subgroup mapping I propose we call parapyth, which George<br/>Secor discovered and used as a one subset of his 29-note<br/>High Tolerance Temperament (29-HTT, now a member of the<br/>larger HTT family) of 1978.</p><p>As I discuss in my next post, you alerted in me in asking<br/>about 4:6:7 and 6:7:9 that you were unaware that they occur<br/>in my _Prelude in Shur for Erv Wilson_, and that the O3<br/>temperament I use for that piece has a just 7/4 as one of<br/>its defining intervals!</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>While superpyth tempers out the 64/63, parapyth leaves it<br/>in, and, not surprisingly, is much more accurate for ratios<br/>of 3 and 7 alike. My longer post gives specifics and links<br/>to Scala files, so you can evaluate the accuracy of parapyth<br/>for yourself.</p><p>Since there&apos;s a lot more going on in 29-HTT like full support<br/>of odd factors of 2-3-5-7-9-11-13-15, you&apos;ll see how it might<br/>take someone with a special interest in 2.3.7.11.13 to pick<br/>out this part of his tuning and make it the basis for a 24-note<br/>rank-3 tuning for this subgroup of his 13-limit.</p><p>It happened in 2002 with Peppermint, for which in that year<br/>I posted a catalogue of near-just intervals and their<br/>mapping in its &quot;ratio space&quot; -- not necessarily mapping in<br/>the RMP sense, exactly, but how to find different primes<br/>and ratios. There a link to that in my next message.</p><p>The basic idea is simple, with lots of tweaking to taste<br/>possible as with meantones -- but Secor&apos;s HTT is the classic<br/>example to show the recipe. Tune a linear temperament where<br/>13/11 and thus 22/13 is at or close to just. Now add another<br/>linear chain -- the rank-3 part -- at a spacing of about<br/>91/88, and you get pure 7/4 minor sevenths! The 7/6 will<br/>have the same error as the fifth, around two cents or a<br/>bit less (1.624 cents for HTT).</p><p>We also get 11 and 13 near-just as well: 11/8, 13/8, lots<br/>of neutral seconds of different sizes, etc., etc. Note that<br/>we also get 13/7, for example, within each chain, so the<br/>variety of neutral intervals is one advantage by comparison<br/>with Pythagorean or nearby schismic temperaments, as well<br/>as with superpyth, especially if we&apos;re seeking accuracy.</p><p>What I haven&apos;t understood over the years is why RMP doesn&apos;t<br/>seem much to recognize this parapyth 2.3.7.11.13 mapping -- as<br/>important a contribution of George Secor, I would say, as<br/>his Miracle temperament published in 1975.</p><p>And the answer your questions about 4:6:7 and 6:7:9 give<br/>me is that you simply haven&apos;t been aware of parapyth, as<br/>I&apos;m now proposing to call it in view of your superpyth.</p><p>Again, my next and longer post has lots of details and<br/>links. And I&apos;m eager to see how RMP might analyze the<br/>commas and the &quot;mapping&quot; in your sense, or approach a TOP<br/>version.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105106 href="#105106">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2012 5:11:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Thanks Margo, it&apos;s good to see you posting again!

This is a fascinating topic in itself, but I&apos;d like to use<br/>this reply as an opportunity to clarify a very basic point about<br/>what a 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup temperament like Peppermint (2002),<br/>O3 (2010) or MET-24 (2011) actually does.</p><p>Your discussion of the 4:6:7, for example, is a wonderful<br/>opportunity to point out that while it wouldn&apos;t occur in a 12-MOS<br/>optimization for 14/11 and 13/11, it is absolutely central to<br/>Peppermint, MET-24, and this rank-3 family generally. For<br/>example, as I&apos;ll discuss below, _Prelude in Shur for Erv Wilson_<br/>uses a near-just 4:6:7 as one of the most important sonorities<br/>(this piece uses O3).</p><p>As your remarks about 4:6:7 and 6:7:9 -- very interesting in<br/>themselves, as I note below -- bring home to me, you are<br/>evidently unaware that since 2002, a major purpose of rank-3<br/>temperaments around 704 cents is get ratios of both 3 and 7 far<br/>more accurate than in what is now called superpyth. Maybe we<br/>should call this mapping parapyth, but the reality is more<br/>important than the name. Each is wonderful in its own way, but I<br/>would think that the rank-3 structure of 2.3.7.11.13 parapyth<br/>would be of special interest to people interested in commas,<br/>mapping, and accuracy.</p><p>In seeking gently and effectively to get these quite accurate<br/>rank-3 system on your RMP radar screen, I&apos;d like to point out<br/>that the 14/11-13/11 optimization tree is part of a larger<br/>2.3.7.11.13 forest, and that since 2002, optimizing the whole<br/>forest has been the main issue for those of us designing rank-3<br/>temperaments in this family.</p><p>On the 50th anniversary of a very fateful day in world history,<br/>I&apos;m writing to urge that communication and cooperation prevail.<br/>In fact, I&apos;d love to see RMP comma or matrix analyses of these<br/>quite intricate and accurate and yet structurally simple tunings,<br/>TOP versions, etc.</p><p>In short, this post is a friendly bid for diplomatic recognition<br/>of a beautiful family of rank-3 temperaments, and an intonational<br/>detente permitting us to learn from each other.</p><p>The spirit of cooperation is really more important than details<br/>of math, and I hope that that, especially, is what comes across.<br/>There follows some documentation in terms of past posts on the<br/>list, Scala files, and music; but simple recognition is the main<br/>point.</p><p>                 *          *          *</p><p>The post on rank-3 temperaments which you mention is one approach<br/>to some of the basics, and I tried to make things easy for<br/>newbies and others who may be new to this area.</p><p>Here I&apos;d like to clarify points about the history of this<br/>2.3.7.11.13 family, which goes back to a subset of George Secor&apos;s<br/>29-note High Tolerance Temperament or 29-HTT tuning he designed<br/>in 1978 with a 2/1 octave, a fifth of 703.579 cents, and spacing<br/>between the two relevant chains of fifths at 58.090 cents. This<br/>was just one part of his system supporting odd factors of<br/>2-3-5-7-9-11-13-15, and the part that caught my attention in<br/>2001-2002</p><p>That was the prototype and model, or _fons et origo_ (&quot;font and<br/>origin&quot;), as I might say to quote the Latin of Tinctoris, for<br/>Peppermint and all the rest of these rank-3 systems.</p><p>&gt;  I guess that for now, all I have to contribute is that if your<br/>&gt;  goal is a chain of fifths such that 81/64 is equated with<br/>&gt;  14/11 and 32/27 is equated with 13/11, then the<br/>&gt;  2.3.14/11.13/11 temperament eliminating 896/891 and 352/351<br/>&gt;  will do the trick. The TOP tuning for this temperament is<br/>&gt;  &lt;1199.506 1902.738 413.917 289.315| where the values represent<br/>&gt;  the tunings for 2/1, 3/1, 14/11, and 13/11 respectively.</p><p>An interesting point of relevance to my immediate purpose is that<br/>these sizes of major and minor thirds at 413.917 and 289.315 are<br/>very close to Secor&apos;s 29-HTT at 289.264 and 414.315 cents: your<br/>shade gives a virtually just 13/11 (289.210 cents), with 14/11<br/>off by 3.59 cents.

In O3, the 7/4 is by definition just<br/>(2/1, 703.893, 57.148), and the fifth off by 1.938 cents (the<br/>same as 14/11). In the 1024-EDO version for this recording, 7/4<br/>is always within a cent of just, at 826 or 827 tuning units<br/>(967.969 or 969.141 cents).</p><p>With superpyth we&apos;d need the fifth impure by 5 cents or more, and<br/>the 2-3-7-9 intervals wouldn&apos;t all be within 4.5 cents of just<br/>(in O3, the 9/7 and 14/9 don&apos;t fare as well as the just 7/4, or<br/>the 7/6 off by the same amount as the fifth, 1.938 cents).</p><p>Again, George Secor discovered or possibly rediscovered this<br/>ingenious mapping for a just 7/4 in 1978 (basically a linear<br/>22/13 major sixth plus a spacing between two chains of 91/88,<br/>which in 29-HTT is what we get to within a tenth of a cent!),<br/>and Peppermint and O3 and MET-24 seek to make the most of it<br/>in different shadings and nuances. I&apos;m confident that you could<br/>come up with a TOP version, too.</p><p>In the Prelude you&apos;ll also hear 13/8, and lots of 13/12 and 14/13<br/>steps -- but, actually, little of 14/11 and 13/11; this piece has<br/>more of a septimal focus, although, of course, in other contexts<br/>I&apos;m constantly using these regular thirds also.</p><p>But my purpose is to put this 2.3.7.11.13 mapping squarely on<br/>your radar screen -- a happier metaphor today than on this day 50<br/>years ago -- so that we can have mutual recognition and fruitful<br/>cooperation.</p><p>Of course, superpyth has its place, also, and the nearer portion<br/>of George Secor&apos;s 17-WT is a great example, see his &quot;17puzzle&quot;<br/>article linked to above. But the rank-3 approach gets both the<br/>3/2 and 7/4 within two cents or so of just, so both mappings are<br/>indeed very useful options, as I learned from George Secor.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve asked you this before, but I think it&apos;d<br/>&gt;  sound really good. I know that 6:7:9 is trendier, but I think<br/>&gt;  there&apos;s some magic lurking behind 4:6:7, mostly because if you<br/>&gt;  double the lowest note down an octave, e.g. you do<br/>&gt;  C,,-C,-C-G-Bb or something, it just becomes 1:2:4:6:7. 6:7:9,<br/>&gt;  on the other hand, becomes 3:6:12:14:18, which is a bit more<br/>&gt;  complex.</p><p>Personally I wouldn&apos;t live without either: I do agree that if the<br/>idea is to have a more conclusive sonority, the &quot;rooted&quot; quality<br/>of 4:6:7 may help. Since I typically treat anything more<br/>complicated than 2;3:4 as inconclusive, it might not be quite so<br/>much of a contrast for me, but still in an interesting<br/>distinction in terms of sheer sound. At any rate, the Prelude<br/>definitely goes for 4:6:7.</p><p>Of course, one solution is have your cake and eat it too, as I&apos;ve<br/>been doing for a decade and more with 12:14:18:21. In this<br/>mapping on two Halberstadts, let&apos;s say in MET-24, it would be:</p><p>       -2.002     -0.234<br/>       264.869   968.592<br/>          D*        A*<br/>         7/6       7/4</p><p>     C          G<br/>    1/1        3/2<br/>     0       703.723<br/>              +1.768</p><p>What I now understand, from your question, is that you were<br/>simply unaware of this mapping, which more generally I would<br/>expect to see as a 2.3.7.9.11 subgroup temperament, however tweaked<br/>or TOP-adjusted according to your algorithms. I&apos;m eager to hear<br/>an RMP analysis of the commas and mapping, etc.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, my two cents,</p><p>A very apt expression, since in this mapping the fifth is<br/>tempered by around 2 cents (in O3, the tuning for the Prelude, a<br/>theoretical 1.938 cents), and that&apos;s the accuracy for the 7:6 in<br/>either 6:7:9 or 4:6:7!</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=105109 href="#105109">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2012 8:26:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>On Mon, Oct 22, 2012 at 7:39 PM, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the purpose is gently and persuasively to put on your<br/>&gt; RMP radar screen a very important kind of 2.3.7.11.13<br/>&gt; subgroup mapping I propose we call parapyth, which George<br/>&gt; Secor discovered and used as a one subset of his 29-note<br/>&gt; High Tolerance Temperament (29-HTT, now a member of the<br/>&gt; larger HTT family) of 1978.</p><p>Sure, what commas does it temper out?

So I wonder if it&apos;s possible to be<br/>even more avant garde with it, and instead of having root-third-fifth<br/>serve as the basis for triadic harmony, if you could use<br/>root-fifth-seventh instead, owing to the strength of the 4:6:7 that&apos;s<br/>present in the scale.

Likewise Pythagorean gives an apotome at 2187/2048 or<br/>113.685 cents, very close to 16/15 (111.731 cents); add Secor&apos;s<br/>comma, and we get 14/13 (128.298 cents), a parapyth supraminor<br/>or small neutral second.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ll quickly point out that all five primes are already<br/>represented in a rank-2 12-MOS: e.g. 21/13 (3-7-13) and 14/11<br/>(2-7-11).</p><p>But to get the harmonic forms 7/4, 11/8, and 13/8, we need that<br/>extra rank-3 generator of a spacing between two 12-MOS, 17-MOS,<br/>29-MOS or whatever chains at around 91/88, or the difference<br/>between our 22/13 major sixth and a 7/4 minor seventh.</p><p>In order to give you some sporting chance to read and absorb what<br/>I&apos;ve posted (and the earlier rank-3 article might help), why<br/>don&apos;t I leave for now with the lattice for MET-24, which may give<br/>more clues on the commas tempered out or observed; and another<br/>diagram showing some of the ones which are tempered out as one<br/>looks at some of the ratios in the rank-3 system:</p><p>   &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-lattice1.jpg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-lattice1.jpg</a>&gt;<br/>   &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-tour.jpg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-tour.jpg</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt; As I discuss in my next post, you alerted in me in asking<br/>&gt;&gt; about 4:6:7 and 6:7:9 that you were unaware that they occur in<br/>&gt;&gt; my _Prelude in Shur for Erv Wilson_, and that the O3<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament I use for that piece has a just 7/4 as one of its<br/>&gt;&gt; defining intervals!</p><p>&gt;  I do hear that you land on 4:6:7 right before the end at around 0:32<br/>&gt;  before resolving it up to 2:3:4.

The 14:21:27 is a strong discord, and could be very<br/>effective in that role, although my analogies might be a bit<br/>different. At any rate, these two could play a central role:<br/>Machaut himself is said to have treated the minor seventh almost<br/>as an imperfect concord.</p><p>&gt;  2) take Gesualdo&apos;s Tristis est Anima Mea, which utilizes triadic<br/>&gt;  harmony in a much more impressionistic sounding way, and figure out<br/>&gt;  how to create the same effect with 4:6:7 and 14:21:27</p><p>How about analogous effects -- that is one awesome piece! In<br/>addition to your suggested sonorities, of course, I would also<br/>feel free to use regular thirds, neutral intervals, thirdtone<br/>steps, everything I have -- this project takes nothing less!</p><p>&gt;  3) take anything by Palestrina, which uses triadic harmony in<br/>&gt;  a very straightforward and tonal way, but make 4:6:7 and<br/>&gt;  14:21:27 the basis of the tonality rather than 4:5:6 and<br/>&gt;  10:12:15</p><p>The real quibble I have here is that while 4:6:7 is relatively<br/>concordant, traditionally major sevenths are strong dissonances;<br/>but let&apos;s keep the spirit of this exercise by modifying it a tad.<br/>How about 4:6:7 as a relative concord, but 14:21:27 and related<br/>sonorities with 27/14 (or 28/27) as suspensions? After all,<br/>Palestrina does use major sevenths in suspensions! And George<br/>Secor, in his 17-puzzle article, shows how attractive and intense<br/>these suspensions can be!</p><p>Getting a sense of classical balance like Palestrina&apos;s with these<br/>materials is a challenging -- and therefore great -- idea!</p><p>&gt;  I just wonder if superpyth implies some sort of secret<br/>&gt;  alternate tonality that exists in the diatonic scale, provided<br/>&gt;  you intone things slightly differently.

After all,<br/>&gt; Palestrina does use major sevenths in suspensions! And George<br/>&gt; Secor, in his 17-puzzle article, shows how attractive and intense<br/>&gt; these suspensions can be!</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s probably right; and 14:21:27 is even stronger than 8:12:15<br/>because the outer dyad starts to (to my ears) get into pseudo-octave<br/>territory.

Do you (or<br/>does anyone) have any idea at all how to start? Or is it basically up<br/>to us to tinker around for a bit until we piece together what the<br/>different resources are?</p><p>&gt; This is an opportunity for very productive cooperation between<br/>&gt; those of us who have been exploring these tunings over the last<br/>&gt; decade from a non-RMP perspective, and RMP people like yourself<br/>&gt; who would like to delve into them and maybe bring new insights.</p><p>I was talking about this in freenode #xenharmonic last night too. So I<br/>guess my first question is, what are the things you&apos;re naming,<br/>specifically? When we name temperaments, each individual thing that we<br/>call a &quot;temperament&quot; which we assign a name to is a different way to<br/>&quot;map JI&quot; onto some set of generators - or, equivalently, to map those<br/>generators back to JI. To be more specific, these are what we call<br/>&quot;abstract temperaments,&quot; which we usually just call temperaments.</p><p>This, mathematically, is the same as tempering out a set of commas, so<br/>you might also say that we name temperaments after the commas that<br/>they temper out. Of course, just saying what commas are being tempered<br/>out isn&apos;t all that helpful, which is why the first thing that we do<br/>once we have the set of vanishing commas is to mathematically &quot;unpack&quot;<br/>that by relating it back to some mapping from JI to a set of generator<br/>chains. There are efficient mathematical ways to do this, but the<br/>average person on here might not know what those are - so they just<br/>see us talking about vanishing commas and wonder why anyone would care<br/>so much about comma pumps. But the goal is to assign every interval in<br/>the temperament some set of JI intervals that temper down to it.</p><p>But the key thing is, we classify all tunings of each temperament as<br/>an instance of that temperament - so quarter-comma meantone,<br/>third-comma meantone, POTE meantone, etc are all still part of<br/>meantone temperament. So when you name things like &quot;peppermint&quot; and<br/>&quot;O3&quot; and so on, are you naming temperaments in this sense - e.g.<br/>mappings of JI intervals onto generator chains which admit a range of<br/>valid tunings? Or are you naming specific tunings of these<br/>temperaments? Or both?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105132 href="#105132">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2012 6:46:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So I&apos;ve finally caught up on everything, and one thing I notice right<br/>&gt; away is that your interval C-G#* is 890 cents, only about 5.4 cents<br/>&gt; sharp of a 5/3.

I&apos;m not saying that all charming neutral<br/>seconds are superparticular, but that these near-just sizes are<br/>charming.</p><p>&gt;  This temperament apparently already has a name and it&apos;s called<br/>&gt;  &quot;Pele&quot; temperament:</p><p>How about: &quot;From an RMP perspective, your MET-24 is one example of a<br/>temperament pathway called the &grave;Pele&apos; pathway.&quot; Then we could do<br/>mutually edifying things like my learning the definition of the<br/>pathway and what that 196/195 is all about, and both of us comparing<br/>notes on your POTE criteria and my criteria for designing MET-24 as I<br/>did, etc. [I&apos;m now confident it&apos;s 49/39 vs. 5/4, but it&apos;s curious<br/>I actually gave a 39:42:49:52 analysis below of a Hijaz tetrachord without<br/>even thinking of what the comma might be; and looking up 196/195<br/>in Scala didn&apos;t tell me much. I discuss this a bit more below -- and<br/>I&apos;m still eager to learn more about the 196/195!]</p><p>A CMP might be a kind of multidimensional map with harmonic and<br/>melodic aspects -- like good counterpoint! -- here&apos;s the pathway to a<br/>ratio of 5 or 7 or whatever at this point or region, and here&apos;s where<br/>your 14/13 or 13/12 might come from if you&apos;re into that, etc.</p><p>So from one viewpoint, MET-24 might be within the Pele schema, or<br/>maybe better yet, exhibit the &quot;Pele effect&quot; or &quot;Pele pathway to 5.&quot;<br/>Saying &quot;MET-24 is an instance of Pele&quot; might raise the issue of who is<br/>defining the salient meaning of the region. But, &quot;Hey, guess what,<br/>MET-24 exhibits the Pele pathway&quot; sounds at worst like an interesting<br/>facet of the tuning, and at best like a high compliment.</p><p>&gt;  [59]<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=58_41_87&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=58_41_87&limit=13</a>.  The<br/>&gt;  POTE optimal tuning for this has the fifths at 703.414 cents and<br/>&gt;  spacing at 57.468 cents, which leads to 14/11 set to 413.657 cents,<br/>&gt;  13/11 set to 289.756 cents, 5/4 set to 388.196, and 6/5 set to<br/>&gt;  315.218 cents.</p><p>Well, the fifth is almost identical to 29-EDO, and this is a perfect<br/>spot for 22:26:33 (let&apos;s not have 14/11 rule everything!). Some<br/>Persian musicians use a really small neutral second around 124 cents;<br/>but MET-24 strives to keep 14/13 and 13/7 within three cents of just,<br/>which means a bit more compromise of 3/2, 9/8, and 11/10.</p><p>I must admit the equal temperament notation looks complicated to me;<br/>why not define the ways we get different intervals and commas tempered<br/>out? In 2001 or thereabouts, I used two chains of 29-EDO at 59.97<br/>cents spacing as one early instance of emulating HTT; it&apos;s a fine<br/>spot, although I&apos;ve tended to focus a bit north rather than south of<br/>HTT.</p><p>The POTE instantiation of the Pele pathway, however, is _not_ an<br/>optimization of 13/11 and 14/11 (in contrast to 33/26), since 13/11 is<br/>still substantially wide of just, so a bit more temperament will bring<br/>them both closer to pure. Beyond 703.597 cents, 13/11 becomes impure<br/>in the narrow direction as 14/11 becomes less narrow, so we&apos;re in the<br/>region of compromise as to these two. And Secor&apos;s HTT at 703.579 cents<br/>is for all practical purposes identical with that landmark where our<br/>strategy changes. These landmarks might involve an MOJ or &quot;Moment of<br/>Justness&quot; (here 13/11), or maybe also an MOE or &quot;Moment of Equality&quot;<br/>(e.g. 22/21 just, 3/2 and 14/11 equally impure).</p><p>Of course, the POTE is going for 5/4 and 6/5, and that makes the<br/>strategy different, too. In MET-24, they&apos;re an unintended although not<br/>untoward consequence, and play no role in the optimization. But that<br/>makes the 196/195 relationship you mentioned no less fascinating in<br/>either, and I&apos;d love to have you explain it to me! Or maybe I just<br/>found out in Scala, it&apos;s the difference between 49/39 and 5/4!</p><p>&gt;  As for how you get to these new 5-limit intervals, let&apos;s say that C^<br/>&gt;  is one of your &quot;spacing&quot; commas sharp of C, and then that Cv is a<br/>&gt;  spacing comma flat of it. So 5/3 would be C-G#^, 6/5 would be C-Fbv,<br/>&gt;  5/4 would be C-D#^, and 8/5 would be C-Bbbv.</p><p>Yes, in that sense the spacing comma, i.e. limma less spacing,<br/>represents both 81/80 (or maybe 66/65 if the regular major third is<br/>33/26, actually a tad closer than 14/11) and the 64/63 (or also 78/77,<br/>e.g. 13/11 and 7/6). Note that in the Pepper Noble Fifth tuning, if a<br/>chain is carried to a 29-MOS, say, the natural diesis is able to act<br/>like the spacing here, and even more accurately: our near-5/4 is equal<br/>to 21 fifths up, or thrice the apotome at 128.669 cents -- 386.007<br/>cents! I guess this is Graham&apos;s diaschismic mapping for 5: a regular<br/>major third minus the 17-note comma.</p><p>So MET-24 exhibits the spacing comma or Pele pathway, while rank-2<br/>Pepper approximates 5 through the natural 17-comma.</p><p>My JI analysis of Bb-B-C#-Eb or 0-126-391-497 cents in 1024-EDO<br/>(126-265-105 cents) would be 39:42:49:52 or 14:13-7:6-52:49<br/>(128-267-103 cents). So, in a sense, it might be like 2-3-7-13<br/>emulating 5! But it&apos;s hard not to think of Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic<br/>as realized above as anything but a remote patch of 5-limit.<br/>[P.S.: I&apos;ve known for some months of the 49/39 approximation of 5/4,<br/>but hadn&apos;t focused on the comma. But if you had said &quot;196/195, for<br/>example 49/39 vs. 5/4,&quot; I would have caught on immediately.]</p><p>For me, you see, the original motivation to look beyond a 12-MOS, and<br/>specifically to 24, was above all 7 -- this was in 2000, before I had<br/>become involved in maqam music. In the 12-MOS of this region, not only<br/>the 14/11 and 13/11 but the submajor/supraminor thirds around 17/14<br/>and 21/17 or whatever fascinated me for neomedieval European music:<br/>sort of Pythagorean in the reverse direction, and likewise a bit<br/>complex and unstable! But at that time, I wasn&apos;t yet aware of the<br/>delights of four different neutral sizes; two were a delight in<br/>themselves, but did give me an expectation that they would generally<br/>be unequal to some degree.</p><p>The rank-2 path to 7 came first, and I discovered it quite by accident<br/>in the e-based tuning I had invented at 704.607 cents, playfully<br/>setting the ratio of whole tone and limma to Euler&apos;s e. That was in<br/>June, but in October I got a big surprise.</p><p>Seeing what would happen in a 24-note chain of e-based, I suddenly<br/>noted that 15 fifths up was a virtually just 7/4! And 2.65 cents was<br/>far less temperament than in what is now called superpyth, or in<br/>meantone, the two well-known routes to 7 other than Pythagorean or<br/>Graham&apos;s minutely larger 135-EDO. Search for &quot;e-based&quot; on this list,<br/>and you&apos;ll get posts from that era.</p><p>I did lots of rank-3 or its equivalent in Pythagorean JI, for example<br/>(2/1, 3/2, 64/63) and delightfully (2/1, 3/2, 7/6), but it was George<br/>and his 29-HTT in late 2001 that showed me the rank-3 path to 7 with a<br/>generator of 704 cents or a bit less tempering.</p><p>So for 7, in a sense, my e-based path (15 fifths up, with the natural<br/>diesis of 55.28 cents as the drastically narrowed 28/27) was like<br/>Graham&apos;s diaschismic for 5; but the Secor HTT rank-3 pathway to 7,<br/>with the spacing acting as the 28/27, is analogous to the Pele pathway<br/>for getting 5.</p><p>Please forgive the history and details, but we may have found an<br/>interesting analogy, and one possibly of parallel evolution from a<br/>rank-2 path to a rank-3 path which spares us some of the tempering<br/>necessary to get a natural 12-note diesis large enough (or 17-note<br/>diesis small enough) to achieve the desired prime.</p><p>Maybe we are dealing with a tuning ecology filled with different phyla<br/>of musicians and theorists where tools and concepts adapt for maximum<br/>&quot;fitness&quot; in a given artistic niche or style. And Secor&apos;s<br/>cross-pollination is a powerful evolutionary force.</p><p>But, as I see it, a pathway is something about which people can<br/>objectively agree: the diaschismatic pathway or the Pele pathway to 5;<br/>the e-based pathway or HTT pathway to 7, etc. Anything reasonably<br/>using the meantone pathway is some kind of meantone family schema. But<br/>schemas can be subjective: some pathways may matter more to some<br/>people than others, but we might be able to sort out some common<br/>schemas or combinations of pathways in a given region, some involving<br/>harmonic and some melodic goals.</p><p>&gt;  If you don&apos;t want to deal with the 5-limit, then parapyth as you<br/>&gt;  outlined it has a POTE tuning with fifths at 703.857 cents and<br/>&gt;  spacing at 58.338 cents, so all of this is very similar.</p><p>That&apos;s the same as O3, with a just 22/21 as the defining feature. And I&apos;d add that the POTE is just one possible optimization: musicians<br/>are artistic people, and we can have attachments to different<br/>intervals that can inspire a slight tweak. For example, MET-24 was<br/>designed to make 11/10 a bit more accurate than in O3 or this<br/>synonymous POTE, but 14/13 a bit more accurate than in HTT. It&apos;s sort<br/>of a minimax solution.</p><p>A POTE can be of interest as another landmark, sort of like Farhat&apos;s<br/>suggested tuning for Persian music arrived at by averaging out some<br/>frettings on tars and setars. We read some other sources, by Persian<br/>musicians or otherwise, including objective measurements, and learn<br/>that &quot;optimizations&quot; vary. Still, Farhat&apos;s is tasteful and easy to<br/>understand.</p><p>A POTE for meantone I might put in the same category as Woodhouse&apos;s<br/>7/26-comma that Paul Erlich would often discuss: it&apos;s one possible<br/>taste.</p><p>And your POTE for meantone is, as I guessed, so close to Kornerup&apos;s<br/>Golden Meantone that Scala considered them equal -- 696.214 cents<br/>(Kornerup) and 696.238 cents (POTE). I can see why this might be<br/>considered optimal primewise, and admire some of the details like 13/8<br/>in a 19-note version (not a ratio I usually look for in a meantone,<br/>but delightful if there -- the neutral or &quot;proximate minor&quot; thirds of<br/>1/4-comma are familiar to me).</p><p>If someone wants a pure 5/4, however, then 1/4-comma would be best for<br/>as a starting point; the math can predict intervals and cents, but not<br/>tastes.</p><p>What these share is the meantone pathway to 5, but not necessarily the<br/>pathway in Kornerup/POTE to 13/8, which might be an essential part of<br/>someone&apos;s schema, just as near-equal Vicentino fifthtone steps might<br/>be an essential melodic pathway for another.</p><p>If you&apos;re tuning 12 notes, then the shading with pure 5/4 thirds<br/>rather than the Vicentino pathway to enharmonic melodic steps is<br/>likely to be part of your schema. But maybe you&apos;re thinking of<br/>expanding to 24 or a full circle of 31, and love the enharmonic genus<br/>in Vicentino&apos;s sense, so you might want your pure 5/4 thirds now and<br/>maybe enharmonic steps later.</p><p>And a schema can also include circulation, as with Salinas, who<br/>evidently agreed with Zarlino that 1/3-comma is not precisely optimal<br/>in euphony -- but wow, it circulates in only 19 notes! That pathway to<br/>circulation was evidently part of his schema.</p><p>The CMP seeks to take all of these into account in a mapping of the<br/>continuum. It tries not to prioritize, but to reveal the pathways and<br/>landmarks and let people decide which are most important in a given<br/>region or subregion.</p><p>                [On project to compose equivalent of<br/>                Gesualdo&apos;s _Tristis est Anima Mea_]</p><p>&gt;  There&apos;s also 6:9:11 too, which might be a nice counterpart to 4:6:7.<br/>&gt;  Maqamic and porcupine have the two both mapping to a type of<br/>&gt;  root-fifth-seventh, so that might be a place to start. There&apos;s also<br/>&gt;  mavila, for those who don&apos;t mind really flat fifths.</p><p>Well, here&apos;s a piece in Peppermint where I used 7:9:11.</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>   [Here you raised the possibility of an analogue to Palestrina<br/>    style using 4:6:7 and 14:21:27 in place of 4:5:6 and 10:12:15.<br/>    I suggested the latter might be rather tense for this analogy.]</p><p>&gt;  Yes, that&apos;s probably right; and 14:21:27 is even stronger than<br/>&gt;  8:12:15 because the outer dyad starts to (to my ears) get into<br/>&gt;  pseudo-octave territory. But I think it would be a nice effect to<br/>&gt;  somehow make that chord sound &quot;stable&quot;, despite its very harsh<br/>&gt;  intonation; I think that if you could pull that off, then you could<br/>&gt;  execute various maneuvers which sound like they&apos;re going to resolve<br/>&gt;  to 4:6:7 and then sneak that chord in instead, which would probably<br/>&gt;  be a very strong emotional effect.</p><p>Of course, I usually tend to regard 4:6:7 as rather like itself in a<br/>style called &quot;Californian discant&quot; or _sesquisexta_ (literally, &quot;and<br/>again a sixth,&quot; i.e. the 7/6 ratio), where the voices move in parallel<br/>4:6:7 or 12:14:18:21 chords, and eventually cadence to a fifth. I<br/>should record this; but of course, it would just be one resource, sort<br/>of like sweet moments of fauxbourdon in Wert or whoever. Kraig Grady<br/>specifically favors parallel 4:6:7 chords, so that is &quot;Gradian<br/>discant,&quot; one subclass of the more general sesquisexta.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; Getting a sense of classical balance like Palestrina&apos;s with these<br/>  &gt;&gt; materials is a challenging -- and therefore great -- idea!</p><p>  &gt; I guess I really just wish I had some sort of inkling about how to<br/>  &gt; generalize the usual voice-leading rules and rules of tonality to<br/>  &gt; other tunings like this (especially things like porcupine). Do you<br/>  &gt; (or does anyone) have any idea at all how to start? Or is it<br/>  &gt; basically up to us to tinker around for a bit until we piece<br/>  &gt; together what the different resources are?</p><p>One point is that something like Peppermint or MET-24 or whatever,<br/>from a European point of view, is like two manuals each in a<br/>not-too-far variation on Pythagorean tuning, plus all those neat<br/>septimal and neutral intervals. The voice-leading rules of the<br/>13th-14th centuries more get extended than radically altered: a<br/>neutral third, like a major or minor one, often contracts to a unison<br/>or expands to a fifth. A neutral seventh often contracts to a fifth,<br/>while a neutral sixth expands to an octave. Likewise with the<br/>septimals.</p><p>But in something like Porcupine, I&apos;d guess, you _are_ dealing with a<br/>different world of basic voice-leading. Probably, as I&apos;ve learned,<br/>tinkering is the best way to learn! And there are new things that<br/>emerge even in a tuning system like Secor&apos;s 17-WT or parapyth with a<br/>traditional diatonic structure (emphasized by my two-manual<br/>arrangement where anyone accustomed to a wolf at G#-Eb will have few<br/>untoward surprises, at least if they like the tuning).</p><p>For example, when George Secor and I were exploring his 17-WT, we both<br/>found that Renaissance or later suspensions took on a new color in<br/>this temperament with its very small semitones often at 64 cents, very<br/>close to 28/27; and I found myself mixing Renaissance-style<br/>suspensions (e.g. 7-6) with some very rich septimal harmony like<br/>12:14:18:21 as the resolution before a cadence to 3:2 or 2:3:4.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; This is an opportunity for very productive cooperation between<br/>  &gt;&gt; those of us who have been exploring these tunings over the last<br/>  &gt;&gt; decade from a non-RMP perspective, and RMP people like yourself<br/>  &gt;&gt; who would like to delve into them and maybe bring new insights.</p><p>&gt;  I was talking about this in freenode #xenharmonic last night<br/>&gt;  too. So I guess my first question is, what are the things you&apos;re<br/>&gt;  naming, specifically? When we name temperaments, each individual<br/>&gt;  thing that we call a &quot;temperament&quot; which we assign a name to is a<br/>&gt;  different way to &quot;map JI&quot; onto some set of generators - or,<br/>&gt;  equivalently, to map those generators back to JI.</p><p>To me a temperament is a tuning where either just ratios are<br/>deliberately compromised, or a period is divided into an arbitrary<br/>number of parts. Thus 1/4-comma meantone and 31-EDO are two distinct<br/>but very closely neighboring temperaments of the first kind, as are<br/>Secor&apos;s 29-HTT and my variations such as MET-24. Something like 13-EDO<br/>is of the second type, where in a sense &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;:<br/>the fun is to figure out what ratios or other patterns the arbitrary<br/>division might evoke or even newly create for us.</p><p>Here I think temperament &quot;pathway&quot; (an objective way to get some<br/>prime or vertically or melodically relevant ratio or property like<br/>circulation, etc) and temperament &quot;schema&quot; (the relevant pathways or<br/>parameters sought be a given person or style at a given region of the<br/>spectrum) are good choices.</p><p>The world, including me, generally still thinks of a &quot;temperament&quot; as<br/>a specific tempered tuning, which may use the same pathways as others<br/>without losing its individuality. And changing this may be like King<br/>Canute commanding the tide to recede (he was precisely demonstrating,<br/>of course, that it wouldn&apos;t)!</p><p>There might indeed be an &quot;abstract temperament&quot; of which a designer<br/>conceives, that may favor some pathways, discount others, and be<br/>crafted without knowledge of still others that the region offers.<br/>Remember, pathways are objective, but schemas involve a sense of<br/>artistic priorities, which definitely vary.</p><p>If I announce a temperament in the year 2000, and someone informs me<br/>that it is actually the &quot;Avant-Garde temperament&quot; discovered in 2011<br/>(whose cited example is discernibly distinct on the continuum -- or<br/>not!), I might get a lot of practice in self-restraint, counting to<br/>ten, and remembering &quot;Newton and Leibniz!&quot;</p><p>But if they say, &quot;Hey, back in the year 2000, didn&apos;t you describe a<br/>temperament somewhere around 704.6 cents. Well, that shows what we<br/>call the &grave;Avant-Garde pathway.&apos;&quot; Then we have a collegial discussion<br/>about whether this is a new concept found in 2011, something I newly<br/>described back in the year 2000 or so, or something that was well<br/>known because someone had documented it earlier. And we arrive at a<br/>mutually comfortable solution. Like George Secor with the Miracle<br/>Tuning, I might find &quot;Avant-Garde&quot; great. And your telling me an<br/>attribute my tuning has, not offering to name it for me when it<br/>already has a name (although that pathway might not), promotes both<br/>curiosity and cooperation.</p><p>Going against established usage can be a needlessly uphill battle,<br/>like my attempt around 1983 to argue that 13th-century cadential<br/>progressions should be regarded as a different form of &quot;functional<br/>harmony.&quot; Nice try, but &quot;functional&quot; means &quot;tonal&quot; to most people, not<br/>&quot;tonal or analogous thereto.&quot; But &quot;directed verticality&quot; succeeds.</p><p>Temperament design for me is something often rather intuitive, rather<br/>like speaking a mothertongue, at least if it&apos;s a familiar region. For<br/>example, with MET-24 in 1024-EDO:</p><p>        (1) Find the solution with maximum evenness where both<br/>            14:13 and 11:10 are within 3 cents of just, which<br/>            is 600-601-600-601..... (703.125-704.297-703.125...),<br/>            indeed the most maximally even choice in the whole<br/>            region north of 703.125 and south of 704.297!</p><p>        (2) Set the spacing so that 7/4 is always within a tuning<br/>            unit of just, if possible -- and it is -- 49 units,<br/>            or 57.422 cents (yielding either 967.969 or 969.141).</p><p>From lots of experience, I know that ratios like 12/11, 13/12, 13/8,<br/>etc., will also do well -- confirmed when I see that 11:12:13 has<br/>all ratios within a cent of just. So it&apos;s a done deal, and no other<br/>solution would fulfill condition (1).</p><p>Of course I know that I&apos;m tempering out the familiar 896:891, 352:351,<br/>364:363, 10648:10647 -- and let&apos;s not forget 28672:28431 or Secor&apos;s<br/>comma! Now HTT is precisely and by definition 1/9-Secorian, while here<br/>the 26/21 submajor or large neutral third, _delicious_ for a high<br/>Rast, is off by 0.5657 cents, as close as we come in 1024-EDO, so<br/>let&apos;s call this a conceptual 1/8-Secorian comma temperament. And in<br/>1/7-Secorian, we get a just 14/13 with 14/11 and 13/11 equally impure,<br/>more or less synonymous with Peppermint.</p><p>Some pathways are mainly harmonic (3/2 about as good or a bit better<br/>than 12-EDO; 13/8, 7/6, 7/4, and interestingly 21/16 near-just); some<br/>are melodic (superparticular neutral steps, with the pathway to 11/10,<br/>where applicable, setting a ceiling on the amount of temperament); and<br/>some both (e.g. melodic 14/13 step and harmonic 13/7, e.g. in 7:11:13<br/>or 7:9:11:13).</p><p>That&apos;s my schema or &quot;abstract temperament,&quot; but your cardinal pathways<br/>and personal schema might be a bit different, maybe with a Pele<br/>pathway in the lower range of this region or a diaschismic pathway<br/>around 704 cents as a main priority. My &quot;just 14/13&quot; may be your<br/>&quot;near-just diaschisma thirds.&quot; We can agree on the nature of the<br/>pathways, with or without giving them familiar names, but differ on<br/>the nature of our &quot;abstract temperaments&quot; or schema. This avoids lots<br/>of territorial instincts which, coupled with different artistic and<br/>theoretical tastes and the human tendency to argue over priority<br/>(again, Newton and Leibniz), might not optimally serve our community.</p><p>&gt; To be more specific, these are what we call &quot;abstract temperaments,&quot;<br/>&gt; which we usually just call temperaments.</p><p>How about temperament schemas, combining a number of pathways --<br/>schemas limited by the available pathways, from which a given musician<br/>may choose a relevant set to optimize and build a given schema. And in<br/>a certain region or subregion, some schemas from an RMP perspective<br/>might be proper or improper, so to speak, like the various properties<br/>(or their absence) we get from SHOW DATA in Scala.</p><p>Identifying the pathways and their possible constellations or schemas<br/>is a service to everyone, and everyone can be a part: &quot;This is the<br/>spot where 12:13:14 is just with this fifth and spacing!&quot;</p><p>And some people may adopt schemas they are happy with which may not<br/>neatly fit RMP methods and criteria, just as Scala often tells me<br/>&quot;Scale is not proper.&quot; The RMP approach as one option, but the<br/>pathways as resources for everyone, and maybe a survey of alternative<br/>schema for a given region or subregion, would be great! And RMP would<br/>be part of the picture.</p><p>&gt;  This, mathematically, is the same as tempering out a set of commas,<br/>&gt;  so you might also say that we name temperaments after the commas<br/>&gt;  that they temper out. Of course, just saying what commas are being<br/>&gt;  tempered out isn&apos;t all that helpful, which is why the first thing<br/>&gt;  that we do once we have the set of vanishing commas is to<br/>&gt;  mathematically &quot;unpack&quot; that by relating it back to some mapping<br/>&gt;  from JI to a set of generator chains.</p><p>This sounds great if you&apos;re looking for new and unsuspected patterns,<br/>rather like flying around with the best GPS and remote sensing<br/>equipment, but maybe not the strategy a typical musician might use in<br/>a relatively familiar territory, especially someone who &quot;lives there.&quot;<br/>I&apos;m fascinated by commatic relationships I discover, or others<br/>discover, in my tunings, or others I use, but tend to reason in terms<br/>of intervals and cents, as simplistic as that may sometimes be.<br/>Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;ve internalized lots of pathways; and, of course,<br/>part of CMP would be an opportunity for &quot;fluid speakers&quot; in different<br/>regions of the continuum to share their beloved pathways and schemas<br/>or &quot;abstract temperaments.&quot;</p><p>In such an &quot;inhabited region,&quot; maybe it&apos;s like Star Trek and the<br/>civilizations they encounter, who usually already have their own sense<br/>of local geography and borders. They would likely be flattered if you<br/>share new information on the astrophysical classification of their<br/>sun, and would be delighted if you took information about local<br/>placenames and landmarks and the histories behind them and made that<br/>part of the Galactic Atlas.</p><p>But sometimes different schema names for different folks or purposes<br/>can clarify the diverse uses of a single spot like 1/4-undecimal, to<br/>me &quot;a pure 14/11 eventone,&quot; and to others &quot;Leapyear.&quot; The latter<br/>schema name implies a 5-limit perspective, since it refers to the<br/>29-MOS as the smallest set to support 5-limit. If we have &quot;Leapyear&quot;<br/>for 29, why not &quot;St. Patrick&apos;s&quot; for 17 (St. Paddy&apos;s Day, March 17) and<br/>&quot;Lincoln&quot; for 12 (Lincoln&apos;s Birthday, February 12)? Everyone can be<br/>happy, and learn about the different schemas (schemata?) and<br/>perspectives.</p><p>For example:</p><p>&quot;Back in 2000, I tuned 1/4-undecimal and liked it; George Secor, of<br/>course, as I didn&apos;t yet know, had similarly used it in 1978 for the<br/>more remote part of his 17-WT, specifically with a pure 14/11 in mind.<br/>But in the older literature, everyone discussing the almost identical<br/>46-EDO seems to be after the 5/4 and 6/5 approximations: they&apos;d be<br/>happiest with the Leapyear schema.&quot;</p><p>It would also be good to define what pathways people are using, some<br/>unsuspected. For example, around MET-24 or Peppermint, someone who<br/>tunes an MOS of 17, or a set of 24 or 29 in rank-2 could point out<br/>that _interseptimal_ ratios are wonderful for gamelan, one of the<br/>failings of my 24-note schemas (&quot;Where&apos;s the 15/13 or 22/19?&quot;), but<br/>not of rank-2! And that broad interseptimal pathway runs from around<br/>29-EDO or a pure 13/11 all the way up to a pure 14/11, where fourth<br/>less natural diesis is still more interseptimal (e.g. 22/17) than<br/>really near 9/7.</p><p>Someone playing gamelan with a 704-cent generator should be able to<br/>follow their own schema; and that interseptimal pathway should become<br/>part of the CMP (e.g. markers for a just 15/13 or 26/15, not because<br/>JI is part of traditional gamelan, but because there general sizes are<br/>highly gamelan-compatible and signal landmarks along the continuum).</p><p>&gt; There are efficient mathematical ways to do this, but the average<br/>&gt; person on here might not know what those are - so they just see us<br/>&gt; talking about vanishing commas and wonder why anyone would care so<br/>&gt; much about comma pumps. But the goal is to assign every interval in<br/>&gt; the temperament some set of JI intervals that temper down to it.</p><p>For your purposes, where you often play traditional major-minor tonal<br/>progressions -- and this goes for 16th-century 5-limit progressions<br/>also -- those pumps are a big concern! I wonder if and when I may have<br/>hit one, at least of an unpleasant nature, in Peppermint or MET-24 or<br/>the like with two, three, or four voices in some neomedieval style. So<br/>far, it hasn&apos;t seems a problem. Possibly on these priorities, where<br/>one stands depends on where one sits.</p><p>What you describe is like propriety or Myhill&apos;s property: people may<br/>take it, leave it, or find it relevant here but not there. The CMP<br/>should show the different options or criteria that people might or<br/>might not adopt.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that we&apos;re in Lebanon, and have an instrument<br/>with two 12-EDO keyboards at 50 cents apart (24-EDO), which someone<br/>thought was what Arab musicians prefer in reality, as opposed to use<br/>sometimes as a model for counting steps and categorizing intervals in<br/>a generic way.</p><p>These keyboards are tunable, but people are so accustomed to 12-EDO<br/>that changing the tuning within either 12-MOS  would be a bad idea.</p><p>But we&apos;re lucky enough to have an option that keeps the relative<br/>intervals on each keyboard, but changes the spacing. So we raise the<br/>upper one by 5 cents -- with neutral seconds at 155-145, neutral<br/>thirds at 355-345, etc. The audience picks up on the subtly unequal<br/>neutral seconds, and is delighted. (We&apos;ve read Amine Beyhom, not much<br/>disposed to get involved with ratios at least in a modern context, but<br/>very interested in subtly unequal steps as measured in cents.)</p><p>Do we need to know exactly ratio 355 cents or 345 cents was<br/>representing (possibly 27/22 and 11/9, or maybe simply 355-ish and<br/>345-ish shadings), or the exact commas tempered out, or whether this<br/>is a true 24-note periodicity block?</p><p>I&apos;d say not, just as we don&apos;t need to count the exact number of<br/>molecules that made contact between the baseball and bat in order to<br/>know that this was a home run.</p><p>And personally, if it&apos;s a choice between confirming that a temperament<br/>I design intuitively fits someone&apos;s concept of a proper Fokker<br/>periodicity block, or exploring some fine point of intonation in Maqam<br/>Bayyati or Erv Wilson&apos;s Marwa Permutations that might give me a great<br/>new idea, I&apos;ll take the latter. Indeed, such exploration may give me<br/>new ideas for optimization which an abstract mathematical model might<br/>not.</p><p>But to learn how a temperament I love either conforms to or departs<br/>from a periodicity block would be fascinating. The CMP should include<br/>a look at designs which fit this model and others outside it. In other<br/>words, some people&apos;s schema are based on this comcept, and others<br/>focus on other things -- but possibly conform anyway, or not. Comparing notes would be fun!</p><p>Also, how does one&apos;s instrument or setup -- e.g. 24 notes per octave<br/>as a preference resulting from technical considerations -- affect<br/>one&apos;s schemas, on the one hand favoring the extension of a 17-NOS by<br/>seven extra notes providing extra comma steps; and on the other hand,<br/>making circulation requiring a larger number of notes irrelevant, and<br/>making intervals &quot;remote&quot; that would be abundant in 29 or 41 or 46 or<br/>whatever. Likewise, a &quot;wonderful system&quot; with abundant neutral and<br/>septimal (or interseptimal) intervals in 24 might be considerably less<br/>opulent in 12 or even 17.</p><p>This last just really hit me! Either superpyth or meantone can provide<br/>some septimal intervals in a 12-MOS (lots in superpyth!); but a rank-2<br/>or rank-3 path in parapyth really calls for 24 or more, since 7/4 is<br/>fifteenth generators (with or without help from rank-3 spacing!).</p><p>So focusing on things that happen within the first 12 notes might help<br/>as a kind of guide to defining the most characteristic intervals and<br/>pathways in a given region of subregion which will be parts of lots of<br/>schemas. &quot;Meantone&quot; succeeds without controversy not only because it<br/>is traditional, but because it sticks to the obvious and agreed:<br/>approximating 5/4 and 6/5. People have diverse schema in different<br/>parts of the region, but the pathway to 5 is a universally recognized<br/>feature.</p><p>&gt;  But the key thing is, we classify all tunings of each temperament<br/>&gt;  as an instance of that temperament - so quarter-comma meantone,<br/>&gt;  third-comma meantone, POTE meantone, etc are all still part of<br/>&gt;  meantone temperament.</p><p>With meantone, the boundaries of the genre seem fairly clear, at least<br/>in an historical European context: say from 1/3-comma to 12-EDO. It&apos;s<br/>the range where we can say that 5/4 and 6/5 are being optimized. But<br/>there are lots of schemas: I&apos;m not aware of anyone in the 16th century<br/>who tuned a bit less than 2/7-comma for 13/8, although it&apos;s fun to<br/>imagine Vicentino doing so -- but 45-28 cents might not have been an<br/>ideal enharmonic division for him, while 41-35 at 1/4-comma is<br/>perfect. And for someone with 12 notes per octave, all this is<br/>academic, at least in their immediate situation, but their schema<br/>might include the special charm of 2/7-comma, or what Mark Lindley<br/>calls the &quot;sprightly&quot; melodic character of 1/5-comma.</p><p>So Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone (aka your POTE) is a sweet spot for 13;<br/>but that&apos;s absent in 1/4-comma. Both are good for 7, but 1/5 comma or<br/>so is great for 14/11 as an alternative third (here the diminished<br/>fourth). A schema might be something including a path to 13 in<br/>Kornerup; or 2/7-comma as sort of a limit for something suggesting 7/4<br/>rather than clearly interseptimal ratio like 26/15. And 1/3-comma is<br/>interseptimal par excellence.</p><p>Thus meantone might be the superschema, but we&apos;re going to want<br/>subdivisions, based on traditional criteria (landmarks where just<br/>5-limit intervals appear) and newer ones (various need higher primes).<br/>Pathways come and go as we move through the region. If the idea is to<br/>temper out commas so as to get this or that ratio (e.g. 13/8, 7/4,<br/>15/13), then the meantone pathway describes a region of family of<br/>schemas, but _not_ a single &quot;abstract temperament&quot; or &quot;mapping&quot; in any<br/>practical sense.</p><p>And don&apos;t forget melody! A Vicentino-style archicembalo needs to be<br/>very close to 1/4-comma or 31-EDO to get those enharmonic fifthtone<br/>steps about equal (and both large enough). Scheidt in 1511 preferred<br/>to have all his major thirds a bit wide, and Kornerup or a POTE likely<br/>wouldn&apos;t change his mind.</p><p>&gt; So when you name things like &quot;peppermint&quot; and &quot;O3&quot; and so on, are<br/>&gt; you naming temperaments in this sense - e.g.  mappings of JI<br/>&gt; intervals onto generator chains which admit a range of valid<br/>&gt; tunings? Or are you naming specific tunings of these temperaments?<br/>&gt; Or both?</p><p>Always a specific tuning: Peppermint (2/1, 704.096, 58.060); O3 (2/1, 703.893, 57.148); MET-24 (2/1, 703.711, 57.422), etc.<br/>Of course, there can be device-specific versions for 1024-EDO, say;<br/>and O3 and MET-24 were designed in 1024-EDO, with some kind of more<br/>even or &quot;canonical&quot; version with a single fifth size a later<br/>refinement.</p><p>There is a common approach or technique in these tunings, but I wouldn&apos;t<br/>try to give it a name that should apply to the region or other people&apos;s<br/>systems, which might have quite different goals (like 5-limit around<br/>703.7 cents with a large enough tuning size).</p><p>Basically: choose some interval you want to optimize, or maybe two you<br/>want to optimize equally, in a 12-note chain in the region somewhere<br/>between a pure 13/11 and a pure 14/11, since these are two we&apos;re<br/>optimizing. And have 14/13 at least 125.3 cents (three cents low), and<br/>somewhat short of the region where it becomes more of a 13/12 -- when<br/>we reach the border, the game changes a bit. These rules aren&apos;t<br/>inviolable, and they aren&apos;t meant as governing principles, only a<br/>discretionary framework for one style or substyle of art.</p><p>Now we set our 12-note chain, and decide on some interval or intervals<br/>as a gauge to set the spacing, which will represent 28/27 (narrow!),<br/>33/32 (a bit wide), and 91/88 (usually within a cent or two of just).<br/>Favorites are 7/6 (Peppermint) or 7/4 (O3 and MET-24 -- at in 29-HTT).</p><p>The only EDO that enters this process is the device resolution, for me<br/>1024-EDO, indeed my favorite, (not to put down 49152-EDO either).</p><p>And then I&apos;ll run it through Scala and find out more precisely about<br/>temperings for different intervals, how close I am to superparticular<br/>neutral second divisions (although I was likely treating that as part<br/>of my plan -- with 14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and often 11:10 as part of the<br/>optimization).</p><p>And if it looks good, I&apos;ll actually set it on synthesizer.</p><p>But if someone comes along with a temperament at 703.65 cents which<br/>they&apos;re doing in two 29-MOS sets optimized for 6/5, I wouldn&apos;t tell<br/>them that they were using the &quot;Turquoise temperament,&quot; or even the<br/>&quot;Turquoise schema,&quot; because I have a MET-24 subset called Turquoise<br/>exemplifying some relevant (for me) commas and ratios. Same region, but<br/>different agendas. But to me Turquoise is just a tuning subset I use,<br/>not a placename for everyone who visits or inhabits the region to<br/>adopt as a standard.</p><p>Of course, seeing how different people draw up schemas for a given<br/>spot of region can be intriguing. But to paraphrase Admiral Grace<br/>Hopper, the nice thing about schemas is that there are so many of them<br/>from which to choose..</p><p>So I&apos;d see RMP as one way of looking at things, and fascinating to<br/>compare with other approaches. And the series of EDO&apos;s suggest a<br/>series of mediants or the like (e.g. 104 + 17 = 121, essentially<br/>Pepper&apos;s Noble Fifth). I notice that 104 comes up a lot, and in fact<br/>it was a mention of 104 here that led me to design O3 (pure 22/21).<br/>That gave me the idea of the region -- but from there, it was ratios<br/>and cents, and figuring out a scheme to take 8/1024-octave, the best<br/>approximation of 896/891, from each five-generator chain for the best<br/>approximation of the limma.</p><p>And I should add that for lots of people, comma pumps are something<br/>very relevant, so it&apos;s commendable that you&apos;ve been focusing on<br/>this. It may be a way both to spare people a lot of frustration, and<br/>to invent wonderful new musics, as some of your group&apos;s publications<br/>have made admirably clear.</p><p>All this should be part of the CMP, with the RMP as one important<br/>part.</p><p>&gt;  Thanks,<br/>&gt;  Mike</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105141 href="#105141">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2012 11:11:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here are some triple Fokker blocks you might be interested in.</p><p>I&apos;m busily adding to the Xenwiki, but wonder if you could give transversals for these.</p></div><h3><a id=105142 href="#105142">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2012 1:54:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here are some triple Fokker blocks you might be interested in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m busily adding to the Xenwiki, but wonder if you could give transversals for these.</p><p>! parapyth12trans.scl<br/>!<br/>A JI transversal of parapyth17.scl for use in calculations.

The 13/11 minor<br/>third (289.210 cents) is also virtually just at 289.264 cents.<br/>The generator for a just 13/11 would be 703.597 cents, or<br/>(352/351)^(1/3), to which Secor&apos;s fifth is almost identical.</p><p>In this 2.3.7.11.13 subset of Secor&apos;s HTT, the spacing of the two<br/>chains is at 58.090 cents, almost identical to 91/88 (58.036<br/>cents), to obtain pure 7/4 minor sevenths.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/secor41htt-parapyth17.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/secor41htt-parapyth17.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>! secor41htt-parapyth17.scl<br/>!<br/>George Secor&apos;s 41-HTT, parapyth17 for Fokker block, key 14 like pipedum17_c.scl<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 58.08980<br/> 125.05086<br/> 207.15739<br/> 265.24719<br/> 347.35372<br/> 414.31478<br/> 472.40458<br/> 554.51111<br/> 621.47217<br/> 703.57870<br/> 761.66850<br/> 843.77503<br/> 910.73608<br/> 968.82588<br/> 1050.93241<br/> 1117.89347<br/> 2/1</p><p>We next move to two almost identical tunings created by different<br/>methods, but agreeing on an optimization that preserves many of<br/>the charms of Secor&apos;s mild temperament while slightly improving<br/>the most frequent forms of 13/8, 11/6, and 13/7. These<br/>temperaments at around 703.7 cents were independently developed<br/>by Graham Breed and myself. Here I can tell the story of MET-24,<br/>the &quot;Milder Extended Temperament&quot; (by comparison to earlier<br/>shadings I had used such as O3 and Peppermint below, as opposed<br/>to Secor&apos;s HTT). With some inspiration from Jacques Dudon and his<br/>JI ideal, I designed this temperament in July, 2011.</p><p>My idea was to seek the temperament with maximum evenness in<br/>1024-EDO that would keep both 14/13 and 11/10 within three cents<br/>of just, while approaching HTT&apos;s mild degree of tempering for<br/>3/2, 4/3, and 9/8. The perfect and indeed only solution was to<br/>alternate fifths of 703.125 and 704.297 cents (600 and 601 steps<br/>of 1024), rather in the manner of some Neidhardt temperaments,<br/>with an average fifth size of 703.711 cents and a spacing of<br/>57.422 cents (49 steps of 1024) so as to obtain 7/4 minor<br/>sevenths always within a cent of just at 967.969 or 969.141<br/>cents, thus emulating the pure 7/4 of HTT.</p><p>I have been delighted with this tuning, and will now post my<br/>MET-24 version in parapyth17 of Keenan Pepper&apos;s Fokker block:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-parapyth17-fokker_g.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-parapyth17-fokker_g.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>! met24-parapyth17-fokker_g.scl<br/>!<br/>MET-24 parapyth for Keenan Pepper&apos;s JI block; key 14 like pipedum_17c.scl<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 57.42187<br/> 125.39062<br/> 207.42187<br/> 264.84375<br/> 345.70312<br/> 414.84375<br/> 472.26562<br/> 553.12500<br/> 622.26562<br/> 703.12499<br/> 760.54687<br/> 842.57812<br/> 910.54687<br/> 967.96875<br/> 1050.00000<br/> 1117.96875<br/> 2/1</p><p>Last weekend, I set out to develop a &quot;canonical&quot; version, which I<br/>actually posted to the list. However, as I will explain shortly,<br/>I got a hint yesterday that MET-24 is meant to stay a very subtly<br/>irregular system. Why don&apos;t I explain first how I arrived at my<br/>canonical version but had mixed feelings about the result; and<br/>then, thanks to a link supplied by our moderator, Mike Battaglia,<br/>learned of something quite amazing.</p><p>For my &quot;canonical&quot; version, I first calculated in Scala the<br/>precise linear generator to make 14/13 and 11/10 equally impure:<br/>703.723 cents (as compared with the average of MET-24&apos;s two<br/>alternating generators, 703.711 cents). Then, having noted that<br/>in the 1024-EDO version 7/6 and 13/8 are almost equally impure<br/>(2.027 cents narrow and 2.050 cents wide respectively), I set the<br/>&quot;canonical&quot; spacing so as to make these two precisely equal in<br/>their difference from just. As it happened, the required spacing<br/>was almost identical to that of MET-24 in 1024-EDO: 57.4225 cents<br/>in the canonical version, as compared to 57.421875 cents.</p><p>I had mixed feelings about this, because I noted that the 7/4 was<br/>now impure at 968.592 cents, or 0.234 cents narrow. Totally<br/>trivial, and yet somehow not in keeping with my concept as<br/>realized in 1024-EDO that 7/4 should be &quot;as pure as possible&quot;!<br/>For the sake of theoretical completeness, I did post the file<br/>here (which I have since changed on my site to a 2048-EDO version<br/>for those who would like a single size of fifth at 1201 steps of<br/>that temperament or 703.711 cents).</p><p>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_105023.html#105106">/tuning/topicId_105023.html#105106</a>&gt;</p><p>However, there is a wonderful connection of which I was unaware<br/>until yesterday, and learned of only when Mike Battaglia pointed<br/>me to the website of Graham Breed:</p><p>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_105023.html#105109">/tuning/topicId_105023.html#105109</a>&gt;</p><p>One of the files I found at Graham&apos;s site and downloaded was for<br/>a temperament in various sizes -- I picked the 17-note version --<br/>described as based on &quot;46 &amp; 17 &amp; 41&quot; and involving three<br/>generators. Since I am accustomed in the regular diatonic<br/>portion of the spectrum (7-EDO to 5-EDO) to think of the fifth as<br/>the generator, and the Scala file on the site had the near-32/21<br/>fifth placed above the 1/1, I wasn&apos;t sure of the temperament,<br/>although I realize in retrospect that I might have checked the<br/>fourth also!</p><p>Having downloaded it, however, I loaded it in Scala, did a<br/>rotation -- and found something _identical_ to my attempt at a<br/>&quot;canonical&quot; version of MET-24! I mean the two Scala files were<br/>literally identical. Whatever methods Graham had used within the<br/>Regular Mapping Paradigm, he and I had reached precisely the same<br/>result. And that rendered my &quot;canonical version&quot; of MET-24 quite<br/>superfluous: Graham Breed, using the special techniques of the<br/>Regular Mapping Paradigm (evidently involving 46-EDO, 17-EDO,<br/>and 41-EDO), had already arrived at that tuning by another route!</p><p>And as I found today, a rotation of Graham&apos;s &quot;46 &amp; 17 &amp; 41&quot; set<br/>beautifully realizes Keenan Pepper&apos;s Fokker block.

The catalyst and indeed in a real<br/>sense the co-author of our final tuning system is Keenan Pepper,<br/>who in September of 2000 proposed his Noble Fifth tuning with a<br/>linear generator of 704.096 cents, thus producing a ratio of Phi<br/>between the logarithmic ratios of the major second and the<br/>chromatic semitone (at 208.191 and 128.669 cents). His purpose<br/>was to find the counterpart in this part of the spectrum to<br/>Thorvald Kornerup&apos;s famous Golden Meantone, where the major<br/>second and diatonic semitone have logarithmic sizes at this same<br/>ratio of Phi (696.215 cents), kornerup.scl in the Scala archive.</p><p>As Kraig Grady observed on the tuning list shortly thereafter,<br/>this was another example of the independent discoveries and<br/>rediscoveries that often occur: Erv Wilson included the Noble<br/>Fifth tuning, with its distinctive ratio of Phi between the sizes<br/>of whole tone and diatonic semitone, in his Scale Tree, and as<br/>one of his Golden Horograms. This Wilson, with his many<br/>contributions to theory, tunings, and instrument design, also has<br/>a part in the story of Pepper&apos;s Noble Fifth tuning.</p><p>Waxing very enthusiastic about this shade of temperament on the<br/>list, I decided in 2002 -- having the previous year learned from<br/>George Secor himself about 29-HTT -- to design a 24-note tuning<br/>with two 12-note chains of Pepper&apos;s tuning at a spacing of 58.680<br/>cents for just 7/6 minor thirds (2/1, 704.096, 58.680).

You need three chains of generators to construct this, not two.)</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=105148 href="#105148">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2012 11:12:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ! parapyth12.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; A triple Fokker block of the 2.3.7.11.13 temperament called &quot;parapyth&quot; (TOP tuning)<br/>&gt;  12<br/>&gt; !</p><p>That&apos;s a really cool scale.

And in a way it&apos;s fitting: since the 14:13:12 and 13:12:11<br/>&gt; divisions are at the heart of this tuning, why not include 12:11:10<br/>&gt; for the sake of completeness, and as an honor to Ptolemy?</p><p>What are you mapping 11/10 to, specifically? If it works out to be the<br/>same as mapping 5/3 to C-G#*, then that means that you&apos;ve mapped 5 in<br/>a regular way, and I&apos;m curious if it all still matches the Pele<br/>mapping in the end.</p><p>&gt; But a few remote instances do not a &quot;5-limit tuning&quot; make; and, given<br/>&gt; human nature, I suspect that lots of people might give this priority<br/>&gt; over all the other features. It may happen anyway, and of course<br/>&gt; anyone is free to expand this so as to get more of these intervals.<br/>&gt; You can also get a nice Bohlen-Pierce 3:5:7:9 in four locations, and<br/>&gt; 3:5:7:9:11 in two. There isn&apos;t a full 4:5:6:7:9:11:13, however, one<br/>&gt; mark of a compete 13-limit system. Let&apos;s say that I&apos;d rather have this<br/>&gt; looked on as an &quot;extra bonus.&quot;</p><p>Well, not in the 24-note scale you presented, but there&apos;s no reason<br/>why you couldn&apos;t theoretically continue the pattern of generators<br/>forever, right? For instance, you can create a hypothetically infinite<br/>(octave equivalent) lattice in which one axis is the slightly sharp<br/>fifth and the other axis is the ~50 cent &quot;spacing&quot; interval, and then<br/>your scale traces out a 2x12 rectangle on that lattice. But I see you<br/>go into more detail about this below, so I&apos;ll respond more there. For<br/>now, suffice to say that I find it useful to separate scale generation<br/>from the temperament itself, so that I&apos;d look at your MET-24 as a I&apos;ve<br/>been thinking of your scale as a generated subset of the underlying<br/>temperament, the mathematical structure of which is an infinite<br/>lattice. From this viewpoint, Keenan&apos;s &quot;triple Fokker block&quot; parapyth<br/>scale that he just posted would draw from the same underlying parapyth<br/>temperament, but would utilize a different scale within it (this time,<br/>rather than tracing out a rectangle, it traces out a parallelogram).<br/>It&apos;s literally the same thing as how meantone has a 5-note MOS, a<br/>7-note MOS, a 12-note MOS, a 19-note MOS, etc - none of these are<br/>meantone temperament in its entirety, but rather different scales<br/>which can be generated from it. Likewise, parapyth doesn&apos;t have MOS&apos;s<br/>in the usual sense, but has a whole host of higher-dimensional<br/>generalizations to it. One can cover the lattice by a regular tiling<br/>of hexagons, parallelograms, rectangles, all of which produce scales<br/>that are candidates for higher-dimensional MOS (you can think of a MOS<br/>as a one-dimensional rectangle/parallelogram/hexagon/all-in-one tiling<br/>a one-dimensional lattice).</p><p>So indeed, as you point out, 34 notes gives you more 5-limit<br/>intervals, which I view as simply an implication of the underlying<br/>structure of the temperament mapping.</p><p>&gt; But it&apos;s the accuracy of the superparticular neutral steps steps all<br/>&gt; consistently within three cents of just (14:13, 13:12, 12:11, 11:10)<br/>&gt; that is the point of the design, with an Equable Diatonic as a bonus.<br/>&gt; And a tuning with the same variety of neutral steps, but which<br/>&gt; happened to place them in between the superparticular ratios, might be<br/>&gt; just as nice for maqam music, although I love honoring and following<br/>&gt; the traditions of al-Farabi and Ibn Sina: the larger theme is a varied<br/>&gt; palette of melodic colors. I&apos;m not saying that all charming neutral<br/>&gt; seconds are superparticular, but that these near-just sizes are<br/>&gt; charming.</p><p>Sure, nothing wrong with those sorts of tuning optimizations; I&apos;d be<br/>interested in figuring out if you can outline some general rules for<br/>the sorts of things you like when you want to optimize tunings, so<br/>that we can come up with algorithmic methods for computing<br/>&quot;Margo-optimal&quot; tunings for any arbitrary temperament or scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This temperament apparently already has a name and it&apos;s called<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Pele&quot; temperament:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about: &quot;From an RMP perspective, your MET-24 is one example of a<br/>&gt; temperament pathway called the &grave;Pele&apos; pathway.&quot; Then we could do<br/>&gt; mutually edifying things like my learning the definition of the<br/>&gt; pathway and what that 196/195 is all about, and both of us comparing<br/>&gt; notes on your POTE criteria and my criteria for designing MET-24 as I<br/>&gt; did, etc. [I&apos;m now confident it&apos;s 49/39 vs. 5/4, but it&apos;s curious<br/>&gt; I actually gave a 39:42:49:52 analysis below of a Hijaz tetrachord without<br/>&gt; even thinking of what the comma might be; and looking up 196/195<br/>&gt; in Scala didn&apos;t tell me much. I discuss this a bit more below -- and<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still eager to learn more about the 196/195!]</p><p>We can call it a &quot;temperament pathway&quot; if you&apos;d like. The argument<br/>over the definition of &quot;temperament&quot; has apparently been raging for<br/>years now, predating my joining this list, and people sometimes<br/>disagree on whether 1/4-comma meantone and 1/3-comma meantone are two<br/>different temperaments, or &quot;instances of the same temperament,&quot; or<br/>&quot;different tunings of the same temperament family&quot; or whatever. I&apos;m of<br/>the opinion that disagreements over naming can sometimes cause more<br/>problems than they should, and that at this point it&apos;s most useful to<br/>simply note what different people call things so we can all<br/>communicate.</p><p>So let&apos;s, for now, say that don&apos;t you want to call that 890 cent<br/>interval 5/3, making this a 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup temperament that<br/>you&apos;ve named &quot;Parapyth temperament.&quot; So then, specifically, the<br/>relationship between your MET-24 scale and parapyth temperament is<br/>exactly the same as the relationship between the quarter-comma<br/>meantone chromatic scale and the overarching meantone temperament. The<br/>quarter-comma meantone scale is a specific scale formed from a<br/>specific tuning of the abstract meantone temperament, and MET-24 is a<br/>specific scale formed from a specific tuning of the abstract parapyth<br/>temperament.</p><p>There a few different ways to state this relationship:</p><p>- MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific tuning of &quot;Parapyth<br/>temperament&quot; (general common usage)<br/>- MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific tuning of &quot;the Parapyth<br/>abstract regular temperament&quot; (using Gene&apos;s abstract regular<br/>temperament terminology)<br/>- MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific temperament within &quot;the<br/>Parapyth temperament family&quot; (Paul&apos;s usage)<br/>- MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific temperament that belongs to<br/>&quot;the Parapyth temperament class&quot; (Graham&apos;s usage)<br/>- MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific temperament exhibiting to<br/>&quot;the Parapyth temperament pathway&quot; (what you just proposed)</p><p>People have often argued over which of these is &quot;right&quot;; at this point<br/>I&apos;ll just call it whatever anyone wants! (If you want to incorporate a<br/>mapping for ratios of 5, then you can replace &quot;Parapyth&quot; with Pele<br/>above.)</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=58_41_87&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=58_41_87&limit=13</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I must admit the equal temperament notation looks complicated to me;<br/>&gt; why not define the ways we get different intervals and commas tempered<br/>&gt; out?</p><p>The &quot;Equal Temperament Mappings&quot; thing is complicated and not very<br/>useful; it&apos;s the &quot;Reduced Mapping&quot; that&apos;s useful. Each row represents<br/>a different generator, and each column of the matrix represents a<br/>different prime, and this tells you how many of each generator you<br/>need to add to represent a certain prime. But if you have a more<br/>clever way in mind of specifying the temperament, how would you do it?<br/>What&apos;s a good systematic way to display, for some arbitrary<br/>temperament, where the relevant tempered commas &quot;turn up&quot; that&apos;s<br/>easily readable by a human being?</p><p>&gt; The POTE instantiation of the Pele pathway, however, is _not_ an<br/>&gt; optimization of 13/11 and 14/11 (in contrast to 33/26), since 13/11 is<br/>&gt; still substantially wide of just, so a bit more temperament will bring<br/>&gt; them both closer to pure.</p><p>Right, this optimizes each interval in order of its complexity<br/>(specified by n*d for some ratio n/d). You can think of this as<br/>optimizing the average tuning of -all- intervals over the entire JI<br/>lattice, with the most weight is placed on really simple intervals<br/>like 3/2, 5/4, and so on. 14/11 and 13/11 have medium complexity and<br/>as such get medium weight, whereas something like 32805/32768 gets<br/>barely no weight assigned to it at all, because it&apos;s so complex that<br/>it gets minimal attention. That&apos;s one way to think of it, anyway.</p><p>If you&apos;d prefer to weight intervals differently, which ones would you<br/>say are most important? Is there some mathematical pattern inherent in<br/>the intervals you&apos;d like to optimize, so we can apply this method of<br/>optimization to all temperaments?</p><p>&gt; Of course, the POTE is going for 5/4 and 6/5, and that makes the<br/>&gt; strategy different, too. In MET-24, they&apos;re an unintended although not<br/>&gt; untoward consequence, and play no role in the optimization. But that<br/>&gt; makes the 196/195 relationship you mentioned no less fascinating in<br/>&gt; either, and I&apos;d love to have you explain it to me! Or maybe I just<br/>&gt; found out in Scala, it&apos;s the difference between 49/39 and 5/4!</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how 196/195 turns up, specifically; there&apos;s actually an<br/>infinite series of commas tempered out, and 196/195 is apparently one<br/>of them. I was just mentioning the simplest interval that you&apos;d have<br/>to add to the set of vanishing commas which would transform Parapyth<br/>into Pele. You could add 441/440 instead and get the same thing, or<br/>847/845. It was just a technical note.</p><p>If we want to not include 5/4 and 6/5 in the optimization, we can just<br/>go back to looking at Parapyth and skip this noise about Pele. So POTE<br/>Parapyth has the fifth at 703.857 cents and the spacing interval at<br/>58.338 cents. This tunes 14/11 to 415.425 cents and 13/11 to 288.431<br/>cents. The general &quot;weighted average of all intervals&quot; optimization<br/>mentioned before still applies, except now we&apos;re excluding ratios<br/>where 5 is involved.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As for how you get to these new 5-limit intervals, let&apos;s say that C^<br/>&gt; &gt; is one of your &quot;spacing&quot; commas sharp of C, and then that Cv is a<br/>&gt; &gt; spacing comma flat of it. So 5/3 would be C-G#^, 6/5 would be C-Fbv,<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/4 would be C-D#^, and 8/5 would be C-Bbbv.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, in that sense the spacing comma, i.e. limma less spacing,<br/>&gt; represents both 81/80 (or maybe 66/65 if the regular major third is<br/>&gt; 33/26, actually a tad closer than 14/11) and the 64/63 (or also 78/77,<br/>&gt; e.g. 13/11 and 7/6).</p><p>Looks right to me; limma minus spacing represents 81/80, 66/65, 64/63,<br/>and 78/77, by my calculations.</p><p>&gt; Note that in the Pepper Noble Fifth tuning, if a<br/>&gt; chain is carried to a 29-MOS, say, the natural diesis is able to act<br/>&gt; like the spacing here, and even more accurately: our near-5/4 is equal<br/>&gt; to 21 fifths up, or thrice the apotome at 128.669 cents -- 386.007<br/>&gt; cents! I guess this is Graham&apos;s diaschismic mapping for 5: a regular<br/>&gt; major third minus the 17-note comma.</p><p>Hmm, if C-C### is mapped to 5/4, that corresponds to a 5-limit<br/>temperament tempering out 10737418240/10460353203. See here:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=5</a></p><p>Looks like the 13-limit version of this is called &quot;Leapday&quot;<br/>temperament: <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=13</a></p><p>What limit is the Pepper Noble Fifth tuning in?</p><p>&gt; But, as I see it, a pathway is something about which people can<br/>&gt; objectively agree: the diaschismatic pathway or the Pele pathway to 5;<br/>&gt; the e-based pathway or HTT pathway to 7, etc. Anything reasonably<br/>&gt; using the meantone pathway is some kind of meantone family schema. But<br/>&gt; schemas can be subjective: some pathways may matter more to some<br/>&gt; people than others, but we might be able to sort out some common<br/>&gt; schemas or combinations of pathways in a given region, some involving<br/>&gt; harmonic and some melodic goals.</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;m confused now - what&apos;s the end specification of the e-based<br/>pathway, and the HTT pathway? Which limits are these temperaments in,<br/>and how are the various primes mapped? If you posted something back in<br/>2000 or so that we&apos;ve assigned a different name to, then you get<br/>precedence, but I&apos;m still not sure which of HTT, e-based, MET, O3,<br/>parapyth, etc you consider to be generalized mappings, or very<br/>specific tunings, or specific tunings of specific scales, etc. It<br/>seems like some of these are different names for different tunings of<br/>the same underlying temperament or temperament &quot;pathway&quot;, whereas<br/>others are names for different &quot;pathways&quot; themselves.</p><p>&gt; And your POTE for meantone is, as I guessed, so close to Kornerup&apos;s<br/>&gt; Golden Meantone that Scala considered them equal -- 696.214 cents<br/>&gt; (Kornerup) and 696.238 cents (POTE).</p><p>The fact that this is the case is, I think, one of the great<br/>coincidences that makes meantone as powerful as it is. Roughly<br/>speaking, golden tunings tend to be optimal for a certain type of<br/>melodic optimization, one in which all the intervals appearing in the<br/>MOS series are as far apart from one another as possible, and for<br/>meantone this happens to coincide with the tuning where the intervals<br/>are, on average, as close to JI as possible.</p><p>For instance, consider an extreme tuning of the diatonic scale where<br/>the half steps are only 10 cents, and the whole steps are 236 cents.<br/>It&apos;s obviously going to be difficult to tell, in the context of a<br/>rapid-fire melodic line, the difference between when someone&apos;s played<br/>a major third and a perfect fourth, or a major second and a minor<br/>third, and so on - the difference between these intervals is only 10<br/>cents! Every pair of intervals differing by a limma will become<br/>&quot;ambiguous&quot; in this way as the size of the limma shrinks to nothing.</p><p>Now consider, instead, a tuning where the half steps are 165 cents and<br/>the whole steps are 174 cents. Now we have the opposite situation:<br/>intervals differing by a diatonic semitone are easy to tell apart, but<br/>intervals differing by a chromatic semitone, like the major vs minor<br/>third, or major vs minor second, etc, are going to be very difficult<br/>to tell apart in context, because the chroma is now only 9 cents. Now<br/>it&apos;s every pair of intervals differing by a chroma that becomes<br/>ambiguous, and that&apos;s a lot of pairs.</p><p>(Side note: try doing this with the half steps set to 150 cents and<br/>the whole steps set to 180 cents, and marvel in the fact that these<br/>150 cent half steps are still somehow &quot;half steps&quot; and not &quot;neutral<br/>seconds&quot;. That blows my mind.)</p><p>So I think we can both agree that these two situation create a certain<br/>type of aural confusion that isn&apos;t present in any of the more familiar<br/>tunings of the scale, such as 12-EDO, or third/fourth/fifth/sixth<br/>comma meantone, and so on. These are extreme cases, and as the tuning<br/>tends more towards these cases, this behavior becomes more prevalent.<br/>What we really want is a tuning where pairs of intervals are as far<br/>apart from one another as humanly possible, where intervals are<br/>weighted by how often they appear in the scale.</p><p>Keenan Pepper and I are working on something to measure this property<br/>of scales called &quot;categorical entropy,&quot; so named because it<br/>(hopefully) measures how difficult it is for a listener to come up<br/>with a categorical perception for that scale. And one nice rule of<br/>thumb for finding scales that are low in categorical entropy is to<br/>tune it to a nearby &quot;golden&quot; tuning, for precisely the same reason<br/>that your work with Dave Keenan on metastable intervals tends to zero<br/>in on intervals that are local maxima of harmonic entropy. The results<br/>disagree with categorical entropy a bit, for instance, which places<br/>the melodically optimal tuning of the diatonic scale closer to<br/>1/6-comma or 12-EDO (with some models having a second &quot;optimal&quot; region<br/>around 17-EDO), but it&apos;s still a good rule of thumb. We want the most<br/>&quot;jagged&quot; scales possible, because that&apos;s a good thing when it comes to<br/>differentiating between intervals, so whereas metastable intervals can<br/>lead to very discordant harmony, using metastable generators is<br/>precisely what the doctor ordered.</p><p>So long story short, this means that the meantone tuning which is<br/>melodically and categorically optimal is very close to the meantone<br/>tuning which is harmonically optimal. There are a few other<br/>temperaments which exhibit this effect, like machine temperament and<br/>its &quot;Schulter hexatonic scale&quot; in 11-EDO, but some of the best tunings<br/>DON&apos;T have this effect. For instance, mohajira doesn&apos;t, and it has a<br/>sort of nice cloudy effect that stands in opposition to the crystal<br/>clarity of the Schulter hexatonic, diatonic, etc scales (to my ears<br/>maqam music exploits this cloudiness very well). Porcupine&apos;s another<br/>one which is more hazy and &quot;pops out&quot; less.</p><p>&gt; The CMP seeks to take all of these into account in a mapping of the<br/>&gt; continuum. It tries not to prioritize, but to reveal the pathways and<br/>&gt; landmarks and let people decide which are most important in a given<br/>&gt; region or subregion.</p><p>Wait, what are you calling a pathway here? I thought a temperament<br/>pathway was an abstract temperament, but I guess not... Does pathway<br/>just mean a mapping?</p><p>&gt; &gt; There&apos;s also 6:9:11 too, which might be a nice counterpart to 4:6:7.<br/>&gt; &gt; Maqamic and porcupine have the two both mapping to a type of<br/>&gt; &gt; root-fifth-seventh, so that might be a place to start. There&apos;s also<br/>&gt; &gt; mavila, for those who don&apos;t mind really flat fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, here&apos;s a piece in Peppermint where I used 7:9:11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>OK, is it the A-C#-F that&apos;s the 7:9:11, about 3/5 of the way into the<br/>piece? That was interesting when I first heard it; it was so<br/>acoustically strong that it destroyed my context of the tonality and<br/>sounded just like a raw sonic object (like a car horn or something),<br/>and I had to go back and listen over it again to be able to &quot;frame&quot;<br/>the scale in the proper context. I think if I were an expert<br/>Peppermint listener this wouldn&apos;t have happened though; I&apos;d know how<br/>to frame it correctly the first time around. That&apos;s a really<br/>interesting effect; I&apos;d like to explore more music which manages to<br/>&quot;break through&quot; that interpretational layer occasionally.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, that&apos;s probably right; and 14:21:27 is even stronger than<br/>&gt; &gt; 8:12:15 because the outer dyad starts to (to my ears) get into<br/>&gt; &gt; pseudo-octave territory. But I think it would be a nice effect to<br/>&gt; &gt; somehow make that chord sound &quot;stable&quot;, despite its very harsh<br/>&gt; &gt; intonation; I think that if you could pull that off, then you could<br/>&gt; &gt; execute various maneuvers which sound like they&apos;re going to resolve<br/>&gt; &gt; to 4:6:7 and then sneak that chord in instead, which would probably<br/>&gt; &gt; be a very strong emotional effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, I usually tend to regard 4:6:7 as rather like itself in a<br/>&gt; style called &quot;Californian discant&quot; or _sesquisexta_ (literally, &quot;and<br/>&gt; again a sixth,&quot; i.e. the 7/6 ratio), where the voices move in parallel<br/>&gt; 4:6:7 or 12:14:18:21 chords, and eventually cadence to a fifth. I<br/>&gt; should record this; but of course, it would just be one resource, sort<br/>&gt; of like sweet moments of fauxbourdon in Wert or whoever. Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; specifically favors parallel 4:6:7 chords, so that is &quot;Gradian<br/>&gt; discant,&quot; one subclass of the more general sesquisexta.</p><p>This is exactly what I&apos;ve been imagining! This is like fauxbourdon but<br/>with 7/4, you mean? That sounds like a good place to start. Do you<br/>have a recording of this?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I guess I really just wish I had some sort of inkling about how to<br/>&gt; &gt; generalize the usual voice-leading rules and rules of tonality to<br/>&gt; &gt; other tunings like this (especially things like porcupine). Do you<br/>&gt; &gt; (or does anyone) have any idea at all how to start? Or is it<br/>&gt; &gt; basically up to us to tinker around for a bit until we piece<br/>&gt; &gt; together what the different resources are?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One point is that something like Peppermint or MET-24 or whatever,<br/>&gt; from a European point of view, is like two manuals each in a<br/>&gt; not-too-far variation on Pythagorean tuning, plus all those neat<br/>&gt; septimal and neutral intervals. The voice-leading rules of the<br/>&gt; 13th-14th centuries more get extended than radically altered: a<br/>&gt; neutral third, like a major or minor one, often contracts to a unison<br/>&gt; or expands to a fifth. A neutral seventh often contracts to a fifth,<br/>&gt; while a neutral sixth expands to an octave. Likewise with the<br/>&gt; septimals.</p><p>When you say the neutral third expands to a fifth, do you mean like<br/>D-F^ -&gt; C-G, where ^ is a half-sharp? And would a neutral seventh<br/>contracting to a fifth be like  Bv,-A -&gt; C-G?</p><p>&gt; But in something like Porcupine, I&apos;d guess, you _are_ dealing with a<br/>&gt; different world of basic voice-leading. Probably, as I&apos;ve learned,<br/>&gt; tinkering is the best way to learn! And there are new things that<br/>&gt; emerge even in a tuning system like Secor&apos;s 17-WT or parapyth with a<br/>&gt; traditional diatonic structure (emphasized by my two-manual<br/>&gt; arrangement where anyone accustomed to a wolf at G#-Eb will have few<br/>&gt; untoward surprises, at least if they like the tuning).</p><p>I guess I just don&apos;t understand, for instance, why certain rules are<br/>what they are. Why can&apos;t I have parallel fifths? Is it because the<br/>fifth is the generator, or because it&apos;s 3/2, or both? Is the correct<br/>generalization &quot;you can&apos;t have parallel generators&quot; or &quot;you can&apos;t have<br/>parallel low-complexity intervals&quot; or...? I still seem to think in<br/>12-mode when I write stuff in porcupine; it&apos;s a challenge to snap my<br/>brain out of that sometimes...</p><p>&gt; To me a temperament is a tuning where either just ratios are<br/>&gt; deliberately compromised, or a period is divided into an arbitrary<br/>&gt; number of parts. Thus 1/4-comma meantone and 31-EDO are two distinct<br/>&gt; but very closely neighboring temperaments of the first kind, as are<br/>&gt; Secor&apos;s 29-HTT and my variations such as MET-24. Something like 13-EDO<br/>&gt; is of the second type, where in a sense &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;:<br/>&gt; the fun is to figure out what ratios or other patterns the arbitrary<br/>&gt; division might evoke or even newly create for us.</p><p>I note that 13-EDO makes a lot of sense as a 2.7/6.11.13 temperament,<br/>with perhaps 9 and 5 thrown in there if you don&apos;t mind a bit more<br/>error. There&apos;s been a lot of useful work done in making harmonic use<br/>of tunings like 11-EDO and 13-EDO. 11-EDO is a real gem; it has<br/>4:7:9:11 chords which are about as accurate as 12 has 4:5:6, and you<br/>can use this to write quite &quot;tonal&quot; sounding music. I don&apos;t think<br/>there&apos;s an EDO that exists that one couldn&apos;t make legit harmonic use<br/>of at this point - whatever you can think of, there&apos;s definitely<br/>something which works.</p><p>&gt; Here I think temperament &quot;pathway&quot; (an objective way to get some<br/>&gt; prime or vertically or melodically relevant ratio or property like<br/>&gt; circulation, etc) and temperament &quot;schema&quot; (the relevant pathways or<br/>&gt; parameters sought be a given person or style at a given region of the<br/>&gt; spectrum) are good choices.</p><p>Is a temperament pathway your name for what I called an &quot;abstract<br/>temperament?&quot; What would be an example of a temperament schema? Is<br/>porcupine a temperament schema or a pathway?</p><p>&gt; The world, including me, generally still thinks of a &quot;temperament&quot; as<br/>&gt; a specific tempered tuning, which may use the same pathways as others<br/>&gt; without losing its individuality. And changing this may be like King<br/>&gt; Canute commanding the tide to recede (he was precisely demonstrating,<br/>&gt; of course, that it wouldn&apos;t)!</p><p>If &quot;abstract temperament&quot; is a bit too sterile, there&apos;s always Paul&apos;s<br/>&quot;temperament family&quot; to make things clearer.</p><p>&gt; But if they say, &quot;Hey, back in the year 2000, didn&apos;t you describe a<br/>&gt; temperament somewhere around 704.6 cents. Well, that shows what we<br/>&gt; call the &grave;Avant-Garde pathway.&apos;&quot; Then we have a collegial discussion<br/>&gt; about whether this is a new concept found in 2011, something I newly<br/>&gt; described back in the year 2000 or so, or something that was well<br/>&gt; known because someone had documented it earlier. And we arrive at a<br/>&gt; mutually comfortable solution. Like George Secor with the Miracle<br/>&gt; Tuning, I might find &quot;Avant-Garde&quot; great. And your telling me an<br/>&gt; attribute my tuning has, not offering to name it for me when it<br/>&gt; already has a name (although that pathway might not), promotes both<br/>&gt; curiosity and cooperation.</p><p>I didn&apos;t realize I was overwriting your established name for an older<br/>temperament. But my understanding is that we aren&apos;t naming the same<br/>sorts of objects; the things we&apos;re trying to assign names to are these<br/>birds-eye view &quot;temperament families&quot; or &quot;abstract temperaments&quot; or<br/>&quot;temperament classes&quot; or whatever the name du jour is, which group<br/>together an entire family of scales and things that you just call<br/>&quot;temperaments&quot; and so on. It seems like the things you&apos;re naming are<br/>specific tunings of those families, but not temperament families<br/>themselves.</p><p>The way we&apos;ve been operating is, if someone discovered it first, they<br/>get precedence in terms of naming. So if you think that Pele should<br/>actually be named MET and want to claim precedence that&apos;s fine, but I<br/>thought you wanted the abstract temperament underlying MET to be<br/>called &quot;parapyth&quot; and said it was a 2.3.7.11.13 temperament? I&apos;m<br/>confused where the conflict is.</p><p>Which specific temperament families are you saying that you have had<br/>existing names for that we&apos;ve just recently rediscovered and renamed?<br/>I don&apos;t think anyone would mind updating a name in an instance where<br/>there&apos;s historical precedence, but my understanding was that it seems<br/>like we&apos;re just naming different sorts of things - there are some<br/>things you&apos;ve named which I thought are names for specific useful<br/>tunings of the superpyth family, I thought (like Peppermint and so<br/>on). So if a temperament of yours implies an entirely new temperament<br/>family (as was the case with parapyth) then it&apos;s easy to name the<br/>family after your temperament, but if you have two names for two<br/>temperaments that fit into the same family (e.g. same mapping, commas,<br/>etc, but a different tuning), which gets the family name in that case?</p><p>&gt; How about temperament schemas, combining a number of pathways --<br/>&gt; schemas limited by the available pathways, from which a given musician<br/>&gt; may choose a relevant set to optimize and build a given schema. And in<br/>&gt; a certain region or subregion, some schemas from an RMP perspective<br/>&gt; might be proper or improper, so to speak, like the various properties<br/>&gt; (or their absence) we get from SHOW DATA in Scala.</p><p>Is a schema just an identifying feature of a temperament? So we have a<br/>pathway, a schema, and a mapping as three characteristics of a<br/>temperament (or is it temperament family?)?</p><p>&gt; This sounds great if you&apos;re looking for new and unsuspected patterns,<br/>&gt; rather like flying around with the best GPS and remote sensing<br/>&gt; equipment, but maybe not the strategy a typical musician might use in<br/>&gt; a relatively familiar territory, especially someone who &quot;lives there.&quot;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m fascinated by commatic relationships I discover, or others<br/>&gt; discover, in my tunings, or others I use, but tend to reason in terms<br/>&gt; of intervals and cents, as simplistic as that may sometimes be.<br/>&gt; Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;ve internalized lots of pathways; and, of course,<br/>&gt; part of CMP would be an opportunity for &quot;fluid speakers&quot; in different<br/>&gt; regions of the continuum to share their beloved pathways and schemas<br/>&gt; or &quot;abstract temperaments.&quot;</p><p>I think it would be useful if we had some sort of algorithmic way to<br/>tell a musician what the &quot;meaning&quot; of these commas being tempered out<br/>is. The mapping matrix is a useful way of sort-of-kind-of-ehh-maybe<br/>doing this, but a systematic way to point out &quot;hey, these are the<br/>intervals getting equated&quot; would be useful. We just haven&apos;t figured<br/>out how to do it yet, short of taking the time to play and analyze<br/>every single temperament and working out some basic insights of its<br/>structure. For instance, I know lots of &quot;practical&quot; information about<br/>porcupine temperament, and what it &quot;means&quot; for 250/243 to be tempered<br/>out (it means three minor thirds = two fourths, among other things),<br/>but I&apos;ve never played Pele before so I didn&apos;t have much insight to<br/>share on it.</p><p>This is, I guess, the curse of having a mathematical framework that&apos;s<br/>able to yield information about an infinite number of temperaments,<br/>but not an infinite amount of time to unpack all of that information.<br/>What&apos;s really needed is some systematic way of yielding useful<br/>information about what a temperament &quot;means&quot; to a musician, but I&apos;m<br/>not sure how to best do that. If you have any insights in this regard,<br/>maybe we can generalize them to a systematic approach for &quot;unpacking&quot;<br/>any temperament.</p><p>&gt; But sometimes different schema names for different folks or purposes<br/>&gt; can clarify the diverse uses of a single spot like 1/4-undecimal, to<br/>&gt; me &quot;a pure 14/11 eventone,&quot; and to others &quot;Leapyear.&quot; The latter<br/>&gt; schema name implies a 5-limit perspective, since it refers to the<br/>&gt; 29-MOS as the smallest set to support 5-limit. If we have &quot;Leapyear&quot;<br/>&gt; for 29, why not &quot;St. Patrick&apos;s&quot; for 17 (St. Paddy&apos;s Day, March 17) and<br/>&gt; &quot;Lincoln&quot; for 12 (Lincoln&apos;s Birthday, February 12)? Everyone can be<br/>&gt; happy, and learn about the different schemas (schemata?) and<br/>&gt; perspectives.</p><p>I have no problem with other ways to classify musical tuning systems.<br/>RMP has just proven to be the most conceptually simple for me, but at<br/>this point, actually, I&apos;d really like to see some others - especially<br/>ones that deal with melody as the basis for music with harmony as a<br/>secondary consideration, which is the opposite of how RMP does things.<br/>But I think leapday isn&apos;t just 29-EDO itself, it&apos;s the name of a<br/>temperament family supported by 29-EDO and 46-EDO, much like meantone<br/>is the name of a temperament family supported by 19-EDO and 31-EDO,<br/>etc...</p><p>&gt; What you describe is like propriety or Myhill&apos;s property: people may<br/>&gt; take it, leave it, or find it relevant here but not there. The CMP<br/>&gt; should show the different options or criteria that people might or<br/>&gt; might not adopt.</p><p>I agree. I actually think that in general, to make an even more<br/>extreme case, ratios themselves are things that people sometimes don&apos;t<br/>find relevant, as Igs was just mentioning. It would be nice to come up<br/>with some sort of framework that left them out, perhaps, and came up<br/>with a framework for scales and interval categorization instead,<br/>regardless of which ratio we&apos;re assuming the intervals represent.</p><p>&gt; Do we need to know exactly ratio 355 cents or 345 cents was<br/>&gt; representing (possibly 27/22 and 11/9, or maybe simply 355-ish and<br/>&gt; 345-ish shadings), or the exact commas tempered out, or whether this<br/>&gt; is a true 24-note periodicity block?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d say not, just as we don&apos;t need to count the exact number of<br/>&gt; molecules that made contact between the baseball and bat in order to<br/>&gt; know that this was a home run.</p><p>I agree!</p><p>&gt; And personally, if it&apos;s a choice between confirming that a temperament<br/>&gt; I design intuitively fits someone&apos;s concept of a proper Fokker<br/>&gt; periodicity block, or exploring some fine point of intonation in Maqam<br/>&gt; Bayyati or Erv Wilson&apos;s Marwa Permutations that might give me a great<br/>&gt; new idea, I&apos;ll take the latter. Indeed, such exploration may give me<br/>&gt; new ideas for optimization which an abstract mathematical model might<br/>&gt; not.</p><p>Fair enough, but to spin it the other way, I gain more information<br/>from learning how these regular temperaments interrelate than anything<br/>else at this point. Maybe that&apos;s just me.</p><p>&gt; But to learn how a temperament I love either conforms to or departs<br/>&gt; from a periodicity block would be fascinating. The CMP should include<br/>&gt; a look at designs which fit this model and others outside it. In other<br/>&gt; words, some people&apos;s schema are based on this comcept, and others<br/>&gt; focus on other things -- but possibly conform anyway, or not.<br/>&gt; Comparing notes would be fun!</p><p>Well, this brings up the point from before - the things we&apos;re calling<br/>temperaments aren&apos;t individual scales, so periodicity blocks can exist<br/>-within- them, but they&apos;re not blocks themselves... So there&apos;s three<br/>things here</p><p>1) A specific scale with a specific tuning and mapping<br/>2) An infinite lattice generated by a few generators with a specific<br/>tuning and mapping<br/>3) An infinite lattice generated by a few generators -without- a<br/>specific tuning, but still with a specific mapping</p><p>I think some of the communication breakdown might be that you use the<br/>word &quot;temperament&quot; to refer to #1 and #2, whereas we toss it around<br/>for #3 (when maybe we should say &quot;temperament family&quot; instead, which<br/>is probably nicer than &quot;abstract temperament&quot; at this point).</p><p>&gt; So focusing on things that happen within the first 12 notes might help<br/>&gt; as a kind of guide to defining the most characteristic intervals and<br/>&gt; pathways in a given region of subregion which will be parts of lots of<br/>&gt; schemas. &quot;Meantone&quot; succeeds without controversy not only because it<br/>&gt; is traditional, but because it sticks to the obvious and agreed:<br/>&gt; approximating 5/4 and 6/5. People have diverse schema in different<br/>&gt; parts of the region, but the pathway to 5 is a universally recognized<br/>&gt; feature.</p><p>Well, sometimes 12-EDO listeners seem to think that the 5/4 of 31-EDO<br/>is a bit on the flat side...</p><p>&gt; With meantone, the boundaries of the genre seem fairly clear, at least<br/>&gt; in an historical European context: say from 1/3-comma to 12-EDO.</p><p>There&apos;s 26-EDO too, which I have to say I find a bit charming, though<br/>definitely not optimal, though it has roughly the same amount of error<br/>as 12-EDO.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s the range where we can say that 5/4 and 6/5 are being optimized. But<br/>&gt; there are lots of schemas: I&apos;m not aware of anyone in the 16th century<br/>&gt; who tuned a bit less than 2/7-comma for 13/8, although it&apos;s fun to<br/>&gt; imagine Vicentino doing so -- but 45-28 cents might not have been an<br/>&gt; ideal enharmonic division for him, while 41-35 at 1/4-comma is<br/>&gt; perfect. And for someone with 12 notes per octave, all this is<br/>&gt; academic, at least in their immediate situation, but their schema<br/>&gt; might include the special charm of 2/7-comma, or what Mark Lindley<br/>&gt; calls the &quot;sprightly&quot; melodic character of 1/5-comma.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m very lost on this schema thing... I&apos;ll probably have to<br/>go through this again...</p><p>&gt; &gt; So when you name things like &quot;peppermint&quot; and &quot;O3&quot; and so on, are<br/>&gt; &gt; you naming temperaments in this sense - e.g. mappings of JI<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals onto generator chains which admit a range of valid<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings? Or are you naming specific tunings of these temperaments?<br/>&gt; &gt; Or both?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Always a specific tuning: Peppermint (2/1, 704.096, 58.060);<br/>&gt; O3 (2/1, 703.893, 57.148); MET-24 (2/1, 703.711, 57.422), etc.<br/>&gt; Of course, there can be device-specific versions for 1024-EDO, say;<br/>&gt; and O3 and MET-24 were designed in 1024-EDO, with some kind of more<br/>&gt; even or &quot;canonical&quot; version with a single fifth size a later<br/>&gt; refinement.</p><p>OK, so the idea is that Peppermint, O3, MET, etc all  fit into the<br/>parapyth temperament family, right?</p><p>&gt; But if someone comes along with a temperament at 703.65 cents which<br/>&gt; they&apos;re doing in two 29-MOS sets optimized for 6/5, I wouldn&apos;t tell<br/>&gt; them that they were using the &quot;Turquoise temperament,&quot; or even the<br/>&gt; &quot;Turquoise schema,&quot; because I have a MET-24 subset called Turquoise<br/>&gt; exemplifying some relevant (for me) commas and ratios. Same region, but<br/>&gt; different agendas. But to me Turquoise is just a tuning subset I use,<br/>&gt; not a placename for everyone who visits or inhabits the region to<br/>&gt; adopt as a standard.</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been trying to say - we&apos;re not naming what you&apos;d call<br/>specific temperaments, but rather overarching temperament families. So<br/>if someone wants to play 1/3-comma meantone, we wouldn&apos;t say &quot;oh,<br/>that&apos;s 1/4-comma meantone&quot; just because it&apos;s similar. But we might say<br/>&quot;this is part of the meantone family.&quot; Of course, anyone is able to<br/>reject that classification if they don&apos;t like it, but I find it<br/>useful.</p><p>I think that sums up my response, but in short - RMP isn&apos;t the<br/>end-all-be-all of music. RMP is a tool that gives us an immense amount<br/>of mathematical information about which temperament families are<br/>useful. That information can be unpacked and decoded and made musical<br/>sense of by a musician, and that&apos;s what I think is the fun part -<br/>playing around in porcupine and mavila and figuring out &quot;what it all<br/>means.&quot; And there&apos;s so many temperament families that I&apos;m almost never<br/>let down, and we&apos;ve still barely figured out rank-3 tuning systems<br/>yet. But the result is, we have far more mathematical information than<br/>we&apos;ve managed to unpack so far. Some day I hope that we have tomes<br/>written about lots of these temperament families and what it &quot;means&quot;<br/>that comma xyz vanishes - but in the meantime, we just have some<br/>pointers that have been divined out of nowhere by mathematics telling<br/>us where to look, and it&apos;s up to us to do the looking and make sense<br/>of it.</p><p>Part of the making sense of it is figuring out which tunings of the<br/>various temperament families you might like. For instance, RMP says<br/>nothing about whether one listener is going to prefer 1/4-comma<br/>superpyth or 1/3-comma superpyth, other than to say which one has more<br/>overall average weighted error. But what if you don&apos;t mind having more<br/>error on the 3/2 because you really want a pure 9/7? Then that&apos;s for<br/>each musician to figure out for his/her own personal enrichment, using<br/>the theory to find out which temperament families might be musically<br/>useful and delving into them. For instance, I&apos;ve found that my<br/>favorite porcupine tuning isn&apos;t exactly the harmonically optimal one,<br/>but one which is a bit close to what I&apos;d consider melodically optimal,<br/>with that 7L1s MOS having a slightly bigger &quot;s&quot; step than optimal<br/>would suggest.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t around when these names were given, but it seems like at<br/>times you&apos;re frustrated at having found some great temperament, only<br/>for us to have come up with a different name for it 10 years later and<br/>not attribute it to you, and then tell you that your temperament is<br/>&quot;just&quot; our renamed version of the same thing minus a specific tuning.<br/>I could see how that would be frustrating. I do think it would be good<br/>to go back and rename things if you&apos;ve named some useful temperaments<br/>and we&apos;ve run over them with our own names because we didn&apos;t know you<br/>had them. And if you come up with a good temperament and we can<br/>extrapolate from that back to an entire abstract temperament family,<br/>there&apos;s no reason to not name the family after your specific<br/>temperament (which is what just happened with parapyth).</p><p>But I think the things you name aren&apos;t the same as the things we name;<br/>from a pure RMP perspective many of your temperaments are simply<br/>different tunings of superpyth[17] or leapday[17] something like that.<br/>That obviously loses a lot of the information that you put into making<br/>these scales, such as which intervals are optimized, so you may find<br/>it a bit of a coarse approach that loses something that you were<br/>after. But I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any real conflict between these two<br/>approaches; as you continue to name specific useful tunings, there&apos;s<br/>no harm in saying that one of these tunings happens to also be a<br/>specific tuning of a more generic temperament family, which also<br/>admits these other scales, and other tunings as well, etc. It&apos;s simply<br/>a way of trying to place your work along a spectrum of mathematically<br/>similar works and connect it to other ideas, so we can continue to<br/>build the big picture of this infinite-dimensional musical space we&apos;re<br/>trying to get our heads wrapped around. Nobody&apos;s forced to accept this<br/>version of &quot;the big picture&quot; if they don&apos;t want to, but it&apos;s at least<br/>useful to note such connections when they occur.</p><p>What I think is a good goal for would be to take some of your ideas,<br/>find out what the underlying musical motivation is, and automate them,<br/>so we can apply them in general to any temperament family we want. For<br/>instance, your work places a heavy emphasis on specific tuning, and<br/>not just the mapping. If I had a better idea of the sorts of tuning<br/>optimizations you like, then I could perhaps come up with a<br/>&quot;Schulter-optimal tuning&quot; which we could apply to arbitrary<br/>temperaments such as porcupine, machine, etc, instead of always using<br/>TOP or POTE or so on. I think that would be a good accomplishment.</p><p>Thanks, and if anyone reads this whole thing it&apos;ll be a miracle,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105151 href="#105151">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2012 2:38:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [Gene Ward Smith (#105118) wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt;  Using the wonders of mathematics, we can show that this is<br/>&gt; &gt;  just the same as tempering out 352/351 and 364/363 in<br/>&gt; &gt;  2.3.7.11.13, which is rank 3.

(This was around the same time as my article in Xenharmonikon 3 appeared, describing the temperament that would later be named &quot;Miracle&quot;.)  My original objective was to map a set of tones in 13-limit otonal JI to a 29- or 31-tone octave as one of the permanently programmed (i.e., hard-wired) tunings in my generalized-keyboard Scalatron.  I found that a 29 mapping offered more possibilities, since tones differing by a 5-comma (80:81) can be mapped to separate keys, but with JI I could map only three 15-limit ogdoads, totaling 18 tones.  I found that if I tempered out 351:352, I could have 11&apos;s and 13&apos;s in three more keys with very little error, and likewise the 7&apos;s in each of those keys, by tempering out 363:364 with &lt;3.2 cents error for all 15-limit consonances.  Thus, HTT is a mapping of a mapping: 15-limit JI mapped to a 4-D temperament, which is in turn mapped to a 29-tone octave.</p><p>I did try tempering out 324:325 to include the 5&apos;s in the 7-11-13 chain of regular fifths, but decided against it because it more than doubled the maximum error (from ~1.6c to ~3.6c) at the 7-limit (where beating is most noticeable) and didn&apos;t give me much of anything in return.  (I just now roughed this out and arrived at a 3.6442 cents 13-limit max error with two chains of fifths 1.5670 cents wide exactly 4:7 apart with untempered octaves; 5:13 is exact, and 15-limit max error is 5.2112 cents, although this is probably not optimal.)  Of course, this will be of interest if your&apos;re seeking a 3-D temperament with an unspecified number of tones; note that, unlike HTT, both otonal &amp; utonal 13-limit harmony will be available.</p><p>As for documentation, the 29-HTT tuning appeared in Xenharmonikon 4 (fall of 1975) in an article describing the specifications of the generalized-keyboard Scalatron.  The 17-HTT set (15-limit otonal ogdoads in 3 keys) was devised in the winter of 1978 and appeared in Jonathan Glasier&apos;s publication Interval in that same year.  I didn&apos;t come up with the 41-HTT mapping (15-limit otonal ogdoads in 11 keys) until 2001 and included it in this message that gives Scala listings for all of the HTT sets:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/7574">/tuning-math/message/7574</a></p><p>When I wrote my paper about the Miracle temperament and decimal keyboard,<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/SecorMiracle.pdf">http://www.anaphoria.com/SecorMiracle.pdf</a><br/>I neglected to mention that the 41-HTT superset is an excellent way to get 13-limit harmony on the decimal keyboard, inasmuch as any tuning that can be mapped to a 41-tone octave can readily be played on that keyboard.  This is to correct the mistaken impression that the decimal keyboard, which is constructed using the Miracle generator (a/k/a the &quot;secor&quot;), is not good for much of anything besides Miracle.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; This last one is equal to 896/861 plus 352/351, and I propose<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that it be named the Secorian comma (or superkleisma?),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  I&apos;ve added it to the Xenwiki comma list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It may be fun to get George&apos;s take on this one; but if there&apos;s no<br/>&gt; earlier name or precedent, this seems fitting. It&apos;s fun to look<br/>&gt; back to the time when he got the generating &quot;secor&quot; of the<br/>&gt; Miracle Tuning at around 116.7 cents named after him, with the<br/>&gt; explanation (SECond minOR).</p><p>Do whatever you like.  As for whoever else may have precedence for a temperament with a wide-fifths generator that tempers out both 363:364 and 351:352, you&apos;ll have to look prior to 1975.  As for who gets to name it (if no one else has done so), then be my guest.  After all, I didn&apos;t get to name Miracle!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=105152 href="#105152">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2012 4:30:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t been gung-ho enough to work out an actual algorithm<br/>&gt; yet.

I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;  probably have a lot of questions eventually -- I&apos;m relatively new<br/>&gt;  to microtonality, having only started looking into it about two<br/>&gt;  years ago. That&apos;s why my original &quot;Three related temperaments&quot; post<br/>&gt;  covered such familiar territory: It was a newbie explaining obvious<br/>&gt;  things to other newbies. :)</p><p>Dear Jake,</p><p>Thank you for your kind note, and I totally understand about your<br/>being &quot;underwater&quot; -- in fact, that might be a good hint to me<br/>that there are other things to consider at least now and then :)<br/>But I was immensely impressed with your readable style and your<br/>interest in this style of temperament. Please take your time.</p><p>&gt;  I should note that I didn&apos;t name the pentacircle comma, the<br/>&gt;  just Canton scale, or the pentacircle-tempered Cantonpenta<br/>&gt;  scale. I believe all three are due to Gene Smith.</p><p>Thank you for this explanation: I noticed you had lots of posts<br/>and music in Canton or Cantonpenta, and assumed these might be<br/>your tunings. Thank you for clarifying this, and my apologies to<br/>Gene for getting it wrong!</p><p>As to what you are terming the &quot;pentacircle comma,&quot; or in other<br/>words the comma used in these tunings, I&apos;d say that there are<br/>actually four usual ones, and that a group of us discussed some<br/>possible names in 2002, when George Secor and Dave Keenan were<br/>collaborating with others on their Sagittal Notation project.<br/>Since I use 14/11 and 13/11 as my everyday major minor thirds,<br/>and was doing it back in 2002, obviously I was very interested in<br/>this process, which played out in good part on tuning-math.</p><p>[However, after writing this and then actually checking out<br/>Cantonpenta.scl, I&apos;d guess it might involve some additional<br/>commmas, since it&apos;s not regular! That would likely be something<br/>very new! This should be fun to sort out, and I need to check out<br/>more posts that might have addressed this. What follows only<br/>addresses the usual commas we&apos;d get if we had a 56/39 tritone and<br/>a 21/11 major seventh. I missed this point until I tried Scala.]</p><p>Here&apos;s a post from October 8, 2002, that discusses the four<br/>likeliest commas you have in mind: the 896:891, 352:351, 364:363,<br/>and 10648:10647. The last and smallest one I named the harmonisma<br/>in honor of Kathleen Schlesinger and her _harmoniai_ or<br/>subharmonic scales which often included 14/11 and 13/11; that<br/>became recognized in Scala. For the others, I favor the naming<br/>conventions of George Secor, more or less, as explained in the<br/>first part of the article, with some diagrams in the second:</p><p>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_39367.html#39367">/tuning/topicId_39367.html#39367</a>&gt;<br/>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_39371.html#39371">/tuning/topicId_39371.html#39371</a>&gt;</p><p>You&apos;ll note that writing a decade apart, we both make the same<br/>kinds of comparisons between what you term &quot;Three Similar<br/>Temperaments,&quot; each going about it in our own way, but following<br/>the same logic. It&apos;s sort of like when two civilizations from<br/>different stellar systems meet, and find that their mathematics<br/>agree! And we&apos;re all newbies at this on some level, with lots<br/>more to learn!</p><p>&gt; I did explore them a bit, though, which led me to understand<br/>&gt; the value of 14/11 as a major third, even though it&apos;s even<br/>&gt; sharper than the Pythagorean major third, and the 13/11 minor<br/>&gt; third, which I really like.  Gene derived Canton as a just<br/>&gt; scale and then tempered it, I believe -- I don&apos;t think he<br/>&gt; iterated a generator, as you&apos;ve been doing here and as I did in<br/>&gt; my original post. But maybe there&apos;s a subtlety there that would<br/>&gt; tie the two together, which eludes me.</p><p>Of course, there are at least two perspectives on these<br/>tunings. For someone doing tonal harmony, classical or rock or<br/>whatever, a major third at 14/11 or even Pythagorean is<br/>stretching it. For someone like me doing a neomedieval style,<br/>it&apos;s the norm: somewhere between Pythagorean and 9/7 or so!<br/>This has been true for me since the year 2000. It&apos;s a different<br/>universe. Here&apos;s a great piece in a related temperament,<br/>Peppermint, recorded by Aaron Johnson:</p><p>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_67062.html#67062">/tuning/topicId_67062.html#67062</a>&gt;</p><p>Another clue to this: you may remember some posts about a &quot;flat<br/>major third&quot; at 369 cents or so -- it&apos;s natural people oriented<br/>to 5/4 would consider it &quot;flat,&quot; but in my curious universe, it&apos;s<br/>called a near-just 26/21 or maybe 21/17 submajor or large neutral<br/>third. (The 442:441 is tempered out.) We can talk about this<br/>more: I don&apos;t want to throw too much at you at once, especially<br/>given my posts already.</p><p>But as to Gene&apos;s tempered Cantonpenta, what I did, to borrow an<br/>old phrase, was to run it up the flagpole and see if Scala would<br/>salute it. Surprise! It uses a regular temperament with a fifth<br/>of 704.059 cents, which would not be considered part of the<br/>parapyth family of temperaments -- but isn&apos;t a regular chromatic<br/>scale, which would have 11 regular fifths! The very small minor<br/>sixth at 752.768 cents -- a great feature! -- is something else.<br/>So this is a &quot;one of a kind,&quot; just or tempered!</p><p>&gt;  Anyway, I&apos;ve found the discussion very interesting, especially<br/>&gt;  since you appear to have a different approach and different<br/>&gt;  goals from many of the others on the list, but since I&apos;m still<br/>&gt;  very busy, I may yet be a few days before I can ask my<br/>&gt;  questions.</p><p>True: different goals, different approaches, and mutual aid and<br/>cooperation! And I&apos;m looking forward to those questions, when<br/>it&apos;s right for you.

It fits!</p><p>Secondly, to keep this simple, I do feel that back in 2000-2002 I<br/>was not merely developing individual temperaments, but also<br/>prototypes for families: one might say that I was indeed in a<br/>family way :)</p><p>And the civilized solution is to keep all the present families<br/>involving intentional use or optimization of prime 5 in place,<br/>e.g. Pele and Leapday, and additionally recognize three families<br/>involving 2.3.7.11.13 that coexist in the same region, with the<br/>new Parapyth being one of them!</p><p>Repeat: current families in the region of 703.447-705.0 cents<br/>stay as they are (Pele, Leapday, and any others), but are<br/>understood to imply a desire or intent for 5; while Parapyth<br/>implies a desire for 2.3.7.11.13, with 5, if present, as a side<br/>effect rather than an intended part of the design. The 11:10<br/>neutral second presents a special case, and may be considered<br/>consistent with either Pele or with Parapyth (e.g. MET-24, O3).</p><p>This should be as graceful and gracious and painless a transition<br/>as possible for everyone involved.</p><p>While I&apos;ll get some rest and then get to actually replying point<br/>by point to your letter -- it deserves my best effort and more --<br/>what I might do in the meantime is offer some links to posts from<br/>2000-2002 both to document the three families, and to let you<br/>read my perspectives back then on commas and optimization, etc.<br/>Some of the terminology is obviously dated, etc., but my purpose<br/>is to communicate some of the ethos and worldview behind these<br/>families and tunings. Retrospectively, maybe it&apos;s a kind of FAQ<br/>that needs, of course, to be updated, with your questions and<br/>ideas an invaluable resource for this!</p><p>Please don&apos;t be bothered by my custom back then of sometimes<br/>speaking of things like &quot;11-flavor&quot; meaning (ratios of 11 and 13),<br/>maybe I was concerned that &quot;11-limit&quot; or &quot;13-limit&quot; might imply<br/>the presence of 5.</p><p>Quickly, and this can be fleshed out at leisure, the region for<br/>these three families runs from 29-EDO (703.447 cents) to an even<br/>upper limit of 705.0 cents. We can think of all three as<br/>belonging to the &quot;undecimal-tridecimal-Zalzalian&quot; -- or more<br/>compactly, &quot;neomedieval&quot; superfamily. They share two themes in<br/>common, both revealed in a simple 12-MOS chain.</p><p>The first is some reasonable representation of intervals in the<br/>JI divisions of the fifth 22:26:33 (near the bottom of the<br/>superfamily range) or 22:28:33 (near the top), with 14/11 and<br/>13/11 both being near-just in the middle of the region. Note that<br/>33/26 is close to just around 29-EDO or Secor&apos;s HTT; while 33/28<br/>is close to just at 705 cents (also 80-EDO). Thus the first part<br/>of the superfamily name, undecimal-tredecimal.</p><p>The second is the presence of Zalzalian, i.e. submajor/supraminor<br/>or central neutral intervals, from a chain of 6-11 generators,<br/>the equivalent of the schismatic 5-limit approximations at or<br/>near Pythagorean. In the lower part of the superfamily range, we<br/>get things like 63/52 and 26/21, or 17/14 and 21/17 (14:17:21<br/>being the lowest-odd-factor division of the fifth into two<br/>neutral thirds, as George Secor once pointed out to me).</p><p>In the upper part of the range, these Zalzalian intervals (named<br/>after the great &grave;oudist Mansur Zalzal, who lived in Baghdad in<br/>the 8th century) subtly shift from submajor/subminor to the<br/>central neutral range, e.g. 360 and 345 cents, or 16/13 and 11/9,<br/>at 705.0 cents, the upper limit of the superfamily region.</p><p>Note that Zalzalian is distinct from terms such as Maqamic, which<br/>can remain as they are or evolve as people using them wish. Specifically, Zalzalian implies a _medieval_ Near Eastern<br/>outlook, which ties in with the medieval European aspects of the<br/>region when viewed through a 2.3.7.11.13 lens.</p><p>Quickly, within this region, I propose three families, one of<br/>which we&apos;ve already agreed upon and adopted. That family, Parapyth,<br/>runs from 29-EDO (703.447 cents) up to around the regular tuning<br/>where 8 generators up provide a pathway to a precise Phi at<br/>833.090 cents, that is around 704.136 cents. Indeed, Parapyth&apos;s<br/>pathway of 8 generators up is targeted not at 13/8, but complex<br/>supraminor or small neutral thirds such as 21/13 (also involving<br/>prime 13) or Phi itself! With rank-3, we use a pathway of minor<br/>sixth plus spacing to get 13/8, and so have our intriguing 21/13<br/>or Phi while also enjoying our delicious harmonic neutral sixth.</p><p>Here Peppermint is a prototype of the Parapyth family, with O3,<br/>MET-24, and Graham Breed&apos;s 46-17-41 tuning almost identical to<br/>MET-24 as other rank-3 members. There&apos;s also an extended rank-2<br/>form aimed at another class of complex and beautiful intervals<br/>(guess which -- I&apos;ll reveal all in my next post), but rank-3 is<br/>the prototype and the classic 2.3.7.11.13 form.

But the simple 12-MOS within it is the epitome of<br/>ChristmasEve: use of 1/4-undecimal kleisma, the pure 14/11<br/>tuning, for 2.3.7.11.13 rather than the prime 5 of Leapday.</p><p>The third and final family is Biapotomic-7/6, where, unlike<br/>rank-3 Parapyth, the 169:168 is tempered out, and the apotome is<br/>at or close to (7/6)^1/2. Moving from ChristmasEve, we enter this<br/>zone where I would say that 13-14-15 generators are clearly and<br/>accurately pointed at 7 somewhere around 704.5 cents. In the<br/>lower portion, 7/4 is at or near pure (15 fifths up); at the<br/>center, around 704.776 cents, 7/6 is just (14 generators up), and<br/>the apotome precisely equal to its geometric mean. At the upper<br/>limit, 705.0 cents, 9/7 (13 generators up) is virtually just.<br/>For people who like EDO landmarks, the just 7/4 tuning is close<br/>to 109-EDO; the 7/6 tuning virtually identical to 63-EDO; and the<br/>9/7 tuning to 80-EDO.</p><p>The prototype for Biapotomic-7/6 (sounds almost like Potomac!) is<br/>the e-based temperament, which I enthusiastically explored as a<br/>&quot;Neo-Gothic&quot; tuning (later &quot;neomedieval&quot; became standard, to<br/>include the Near Eastern or Zalzalian elements) in a 12-MOS<br/>during the summer and 2000. Then, suddenly, in October 2000, I<br/>realized that 15 fifths up would form a virtually just 7/4 minor<br/>seventh!

I&apos;m delighted by these names,<br/>and find it simplest and best to regard the three families I<br/>originally proposed as in fact subfamilies of Gentle.</p><p>My apologies for the length of what follows, with much of your<br/>letter left to reply to, including the question of 196/195, which<br/>I think I may understand, at least in the context of MET-24.</p><p>Often it seems that I may be saying too much, and threatening to<br/>turn a dialogue into a monologue; yet saying too little might not<br/>communicate the clearest answer. There&apos;s a real dilemma here, and<br/>I&apos;m resisting what might be the wise inclination to spend an hour<br/>or two trimming this. Please feel free to tell me that my<br/>inclination would have pointed me to the right choice :)</p><p>&gt;  What are you mapping 11/10 to, specifically? If it works out<br/>&gt;  to be the same as mapping 5/3 to C-G#*, then that means that<br/>&gt;  you&apos;ve mapped 5 in a regular way, and I&apos;m curious if it all<br/>&gt;  still matches the Pele mapping in the end.</p><p>Good question. The 11/10 is the rank-2 diminished third or<br/>&quot;dilimma,&quot; e.g. C#-Eb, essentially equal to twice the limma at<br/>around 22/21. In MET-24, the usual 1024-EDO version, however, we<br/>do a bit better than 441/440 narrow, because the slightly and<br/>unavoidably irregular tempering of the fifths results in two<br/>limmas at 80.859 and 82.031 cents, and thus 11/10 at 162.891<br/>cents.</p><p>There&apos;s another comma tempered out: 441/440!</p><p>Note that the purpose is to get 11/10 neutral steps, and<br/>associated intervals such as al-Farabi&apos;s tetrachord, which we<br/>would now call a bright Rast, at 9/8-99/80-4/3 (0-204-369-498<br/>cents) or 9:8:11:10-320:297 (204-165-129 cents). The 5-limit, in<br/>the sense of 5-odd, isn&apos;t the focus, but rather large and small<br/>neutral intervals.</p><p>And the 11/10 occurs in the basic 12-MOS from 10 generators down,<br/>a size where there are no 5-limit thirds -- and likewise in a<br/>17-MOS.</p><p>I should add that a convincing 11/10 is possible in Parapyth from<br/>29-EDO up to O3 or 1/5-kleisma (i.e. 896/891^1/5 with 22/21<br/>just), but by Peppermint it&apos;s not really there: we have more of a<br/>23/21 or whatever (159.044 cents). So it&apos;s in lower Parapyth that<br/>we have 11:10 as well as 12:11, 13:12, and 14:13 all as goals in<br/>the optimization.</p><p>   [On the potential for an expanded MET-24 to represent Pele]</p><p>&gt;  Well, not in the 24-note scale you presented, but there&apos;s no reason<br/>&gt;  why you couldn&apos;t theoretically continue the pattern of generators<br/>&gt;  forever, right?</p><p>Agreed! And there is a possible &quot;diplomatic solution&quot; here: to<br/>recognize both the original intent and actual capabilities or<br/>potentials of system that&apos;s 2.3.7.11.13 in intent but<br/>&quot;Pele-compatible&quot; or &quot;Pele-expandable&quot; in structure.</p><p>&gt;  For instance, you can create a hypothetically infinite (octave<br/>&gt;  equivalent) lattice in which one axis is the slightly sharp<br/>&gt;  fifth and the other axis is the ~50 cent &quot;spacing&quot; interval,<br/>&gt;  and then your scale traces out a 2x12 rectangle on that<br/>&gt;  lattice. But I see you go into more detail about this below,<br/>&gt;  so I&apos;ll respond more there.</p><p>Well put! As you say, we&apos;ll pick this up more below, but I just<br/>want to say that so far we&apos;re in total agreement.</p><p>&gt; For now, suffice to say that I find it useful to separate scale<br/>&gt; generation from the temperament itself, so that I&apos;d look at<br/>&gt; your MET-24 as a I&apos;ve been thinking of your scale as a<br/>&gt; generated subset of the underlying temperament, the<br/>&gt; mathematical structure of which is an infinite lattice. From<br/>&gt; this viewpoint, Keenan&apos;s &quot;triple Fokker block&quot; parapyth scale<br/>&gt; that he just posted would draw from the same underlying<br/>&gt; parapyth temperament, but would utilize a different scale<br/>&gt; within it (this time, rather than tracing out a rectangle, it<br/>&gt; traces out a parallelogram).</p><p>So that&apos;s what PIPEDUM means! In Scala, it&apos;s called a<br/>parallelepiped, which I seem to recall from looking into 3-D<br/>graphics means a 3-D extension of a parallelogram.</p><p>But we&apos;re totally agreed: it could be 2x17, or 2x29, etc.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s literally the same thing as how meantone has a 5-note MOS,<br/>&gt; a 7-note MOS, a 12-note MOS, a 19-note MOS, etc - none of these<br/>&gt; are meantone temperament in its entirety, but rather different<br/>&gt; scales which can be generated from it. Likewise, parapyth<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have MOS&apos;s in the usual sense, but has a whole host of<br/>&gt; higher-dimensional generalizations to it. One can cover the<br/>&gt; lattice by a regular tiling of hexagons, parallelograms,<br/>&gt; rectangles, all of which produce scales that are candidates for<br/>&gt; higher-dimensional MOS (you can think of a MOS as a<br/>&gt; one-dimensional rectangle/parallelogram/hexagon/all-in-one<br/>&gt; tiling a one-dimensional lattice).</p><p>This is a beautiful and awesome description, at once<br/>mathematically accurate and poetic! And your remark that parapyth<br/>&quot;doesn&apos;t have MOS&apos;s in the usual sense&quot; makes me wonder if a<br/>comment I read about Starling might apply here also. It was<br/>something like, &quot;We usually don&apos;t give scales, because Starling<br/>is like an open JI lattice.&quot;</p><p>&gt; So indeed, as you point out, 34 notes gives you more 5-limit<br/>&gt; intervals, which I view as simply an implication of the<br/>&gt; underlying structure of the temperament mapping.</p><p>True, of course. We might say that MET-24, and temperaments of<br/>the Parapyth class or family in its lower range especially (here<br/>at 703.711 cents), are &quot;Pele-compatible&quot; or &quot;Pele-expandable.&quot;<br/>The 5-limit isn&apos;t part of the design: these are some rare and<br/>remote intervals cast at one&apos;s feet by the equations, adding a<br/>bit of extra variety to what was already a complete system based<br/>on 2.3.7.11.13. But someone who wants to make it part of their<br/>integral design, using the same &quot;underlying structure,&quot; can!</p><p>Similarly, MET-24 happens to have two major sixths at 924.609<br/>cents, a virtually just 29/17 (924.622 cents). But I&apos;d be<br/>hesitant to describe the system as prime-29 in its design,<br/>although those sixths are there, and actually more &quot;ordinary&quot;<br/>from a neomedieval perspective than 5/3, although they all are<br/>part of the picture.</p><p>&gt;  Sure, nothing wrong with those sorts of tuning optimizations; I&apos;d<br/>&gt;  be interested in figuring out if you can outline some general rules<br/>&gt;  for the sorts of things you like when you want to optimize tunings,<br/>&gt;  so that we can come up with algorithmic methods for computing<br/>&gt;  &quot;Margo-optimal&quot; tunings for any arbitrary temperament or scale.</p><p>For the Gentle family, I&apos;ll try for once to be concise while<br/>giving a sense of the different subfamilies. Note that my remarks<br/>are descriptive of how I approach things, not prescriptive:<br/>tastes may well vary, including my own on different occasions.</p><p>My apologies for possibly diverting our dialogue into a monologue<br/>of over 100 lines, which I&apos;ll thus set off with asterisks so that<br/>people will feel free to jump over it if they&apos;d like to rejoin<br/>our general conversation. But it may be helpful to document a bit<br/>about my sense of the three subfamilies of Gentle. And the<br/>boundaries I propose are open to criticism, feedback,<br/>negotiation, and revision!</p><p>                   *              *             *</p><p>Parapyth in its classic rank-3 form is the most intricate, the<br/>range running from 29-EDO (703.447 cents) to the temperament for<br/>a precise Phi from 8 fifths up (704.136 cents):</p><p>      (1) We want the effect of 3/2 and 4/3 to be &quot;almost&quot;<br/>          Pythagorean, so MET-24 in 1024-EDO with its 6 fifths in<br/>          each 12-note chain at 703.125 cents is especially<br/>          attractive, and the ones at 704.297 cents aren&apos;t that<br/>          much more impure than 12n-EDO.</p><p>      (2) We want to temper enough so that 14/11 and 13/11 are<br/>          both within three cents of just, but the former might<br/>          still be a bit closer to 33/26, as in MET-24; however,<br/>          as in meantone, the nice thing about shadings is that<br/>          there are so many from which to choose!</p><p>      (3) A major reason for tempering is to make the diminished<br/>          fourth a large neutral third at around 26/21 or 21/17,<br/>          for example; and the augmented fourth a small neutral<br/>          third at around 63/52 or 17/14, etc. In other words, we<br/>          are deliberately tempering _away_ from the 5-limit!<br/>          Both our regular and &quot;alternative&quot; thirds (8-9<br/>          generators) are relatively blending but active and<br/>          rather complex, like medieval Pythagorean thirds.</p><p>      (4) Melodically, the whole tone will represent both 9/8 and<br/>          44/39, while the apotome will represent 14/13, and the<br/>          limma 22/21. We want a better 9/8 than 12n-EDO, and at<br/>          the same time an excellent 44/39. We also want, in<br/>          MET-24, 14/13 and 11/10 (the double limma or augmented<br/>          third, e.g. C#-Eb) about equally impure, a defining<br/>          parameter of MET-24.</p><p>      (5) The spacing should be set for an eigenmonzo of 7/4 in<br/>          this range around 703.7-703.9 cents (MET-24, O3), but<br/>          for an eigenmonzo of 7/6 around Peppermint (704.096<br/>          cents). Right around 704 cents, as in my &quot;Friendly<br/>          Introduction&quot; article, we might split the difference<br/>          and have both 7/4 and 7/6 about a cent impure.</p><p>      (6) In MET-24 or O3, we&apos;ll have representations of 14:13,<br/>          13:12, 12:11, and 11:10 all within three cents or so of<br/>          just -- with MET-24 at the point of equal impurity for<br/>          14:13 and 11:10, In the Peppermint region, we won&apos;t<br/>          really have anything close to 11/10 -- but rather a<br/>          just or virtually just 12:13:14.</p><p>      (7) Swiss Tetrads, in Xenwiki parlance, 12:14:21:24, are of<br/>          the essence: the 9/7 may be up to 4 cents or a bit more<br/>          wide in a 1024-EDO version of MET-24 or O3, with 7/4 as<br/>          the eigenmonzo; but Peppermint with a 7/6 eigenmonzo is<br/>          the minimax solution. With the first two tunings, we<br/>          put on our &quot;352/273 is Beautiful!&quot; t-shirt, and<br/>          speculate that Marchettus of Padua may have sung it the<br/>          same way.</p><p>While we&apos;re at it, let&apos;s not forget parapyth rank-2 either, whose<br/>special attraction is the wonderful family of interseptimal<br/>intervals, or interseptimals for short, located somewhere between<br/>8/7 and 7/6; 9/7 and 21/16; 32/21 and 14/9; and 12/7 and 7/4.<br/>These are neat for some exuberant neo-14th century European<br/>cadences, gamelan, and much else. With rank-2 Parapyth, 13-14-15<br/>generators are a pathway and passport to interseptimal space.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://mschulter">http://mschulter</a>@.../~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt&gt;</p><p>Here a starting point might be set 8 fifths up at or near Phi<br/>(833.090 cents), with Peppermint (704.096 cents) very close to<br/>the precise Phi tuning of 704.136 cents. In the Phi tuning that<br/>marks the upper border of Parapyth we&apos;ll get interseptimals at<br/>446.228 cents and 257.908 cents; and a small minor seventh of<br/>962.044 cents that moves into the septimal region. The 12-tone<br/>diesis at 49.635 cents is great for some exuberant 14th-century<br/>European cadences, while there are also some gamelan potentials<br/>for the division of the tempered 4/3 into 258-238 cents, etc.<br/>Note how 13-14 generators are pointed not at prime 7, but at the<br/>open reaches of interseptimal space.</p><p>How about the rank-2 families: ChristmasEve or 12/24, and<br/>Bi-apotomic-7/6?</p><p>For ChristmasEve, running from 704.136 cents to 704.5 cents:</p><p>       (1) Go for the eigenmonzo, 704.377 cents, making 14/11 and<br/>           11/7 just.</p><p>Note that we&apos;re on a cusp between interseptimal and septimal: 13 generators gives us 443.009 cents, the better part of a full<br/>896:891 wide of 9/7, but very close to 128/99 (444.772 cents).<br/>Commawise, the 17-comma is close to 64:63 (27.264 cents), the<br/>difference between the pure 14/11 and 128/99. The 7/6 is still<br/>narrow by over five cents at 261.278 cents, with only 7/4 really<br/>getting close at 965.655 cents (3.171 cents narrow).</p><p>That&apos;s why, from a neomedieval perspective, the ChristmasEve<br/>region around a pure 14/11 tuning is transitional rather than<br/>clearly interseptimal or septimal, and Bi-apotomic-7/6 is a<br/>separate family. This starts around 704.5 cents or so, and its<br/>trademark is accurate septimal approximations from 13-14-15<br/>generators, with twice the apotome (e.g. C-Cx) representing 7/6.</p><p>For Bi-apotomic-7/6, at 704.5-705.0 cents:</p><p>        (1) Go for your favorite eigenmonzo, or something near<br/>            it: a pure 7/4 (704,588 cents) or the nearby e-based<br/>            tuning (704.607 cents) where the tone and diatonic<br/>            semitone have a logarithmic ratio equal to Euler&apos;s e,<br/>            2.71827, a kind of honorific pun since Euler<br/>            championed 7/4 as a new consonance; or the minimax<br/>            tuning with a pure 7/6 (704.776 cents); or the tuning<br/>            with a pure 9/7, which we&apos;ll minutely overshoot by<br/>            rounding to an even 705.0 cents.</p><p>Finally, like meantone between 1/4-comma and 2/7-comma, every<br/>shade is worth exploring and there&apos;s no &quot;wrong&quot; choice: I&apos;m just<br/>pointing out some favorites of my own as possible starting<br/>points.</p><p>                   *              *             *</p><p>&gt;  We can call it a &quot;temperament pathway&quot; if you&apos;d like. The<br/>&gt;  argument over the definition of &quot;temperament&quot; has apparently<br/>&gt;  been raging for years now, predating my joining this list, and<br/>&gt;  people sometimes disagree on whether 1/4-comma meantone and<br/>&gt;  1/3-comma meantone are two different temperaments, or<br/>&gt;  &quot;instances of the same temperament,&quot; or &quot;different tunings of<br/>&gt;  the same temperament family&quot; or whatever. I&apos;m of the opinion<br/>&gt;  that disagreements over naming can sometimes cause more<br/>&gt;  problems than they should, and that at this point it&apos;s most<br/>&gt;  useful to simply note what different people call things so we<br/>&gt;  can all communicate.</p><p>True! Temperament families and subfamilies are very natural for<br/>me, and classes and subclasses pretty much equivalent. I like<br/>families because it reminds me of biological taxonomy, and has a<br/>friendly sound. A &quot;pathway,&quot; to me, would mean a strategy for<br/>getting a specific prime or other desired type of interval: &quot;The<br/>pathway to 13/8 in rank-3 Parapyth is a minor sixth (4 fifths<br/>down) plus spacing; while an augmented fifth or 8 fifths up is<br/>the pathway to 21/13 or Phi.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  So let&apos;s, for now, say that don&apos;t you want to call that 890<br/>&gt;  cent interval 5/3, making this a 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup<br/>&gt;  temperament that you&apos;ve named &quot;Parapyth temperament.&quot;</p><p>A good question that invites me to clarify my view. First, I<br/>would playfully note that the remote sixth we&apos;re discussing is actually 887.1 cents: the near-21/13 augmented fifth C-G# at<br/>829.7 cents, plus the spacing of 57.4 cents. That&apos;s 2.751 cents<br/>wide of 5/3, or a bit more accurate than Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma<br/>meantone.</p><p>But let&apos;s cut to the chase here, from a neomedieval perspective.</p><p>In Parapyth, we&apos;ve slipped the silken bonds of 5, and find<br/>ourselves in a different space where 14/13 and 13/11, and various<br/>kinds of neutral and septimal intervals are the new luminaries.<br/>This is a beautiful experience, but maybe not so easy to explain<br/>to those who haven&apos;t yet made the journey.</p><p>And, vitally important, 16th-century European modal polyphony<br/>with its 5-limit ideal or major/minor tonality is _not_ the<br/>intended style, but something like 13th-14th-century European<br/>polyphony or Near Eastern styles emphasizing neutral intervals.<br/>Saying &quot;13-limit&quot; creates misleading expectations. In contrast,<br/>saying 2.3.7.11.13 alerts people that this is something else<br/>again, with George Secor&apos;s article a classic on some of the new<br/>as well as old sounds possible:</p><p>          &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Suppose someone is looking for a vacation of &quot;surf and sun,&quot;<br/>which may mean basking in Sol&apos;s tangible warmth at Malibu in<br/>California.</p><p>But Parapyth is more like a journey to Ursa Major, where it<br/>remains possible to admire Sol -- as a charmingly remote star in<br/>some constellation.</p><p>Now Sol is Sol, no matter where we view it from; and I&apos;d<br/>certainly consider 887.1 cents to represent 5/3.</p><p>But Parapyth, or a journey to Ursa Major, may disappoint someone<br/>who sees mention of &quot;basking in the sun&quot; and expects to look out<br/>the window of our spaceship and see sand, surf, and beach<br/>blankets!</p><p>Of course, as you observe, 24-note Parapyth is Pele-compatible,<br/>or more precisely Pele-expandable, since someone oriented to 5<br/>will likely want way more than three 5/4 locations!</p><p>&gt;  So then, specifically, the relationship between your MET-24<br/>&gt;  scale and parapyth temperament is exactly the same as the<br/>&gt;  relationship between the quarter-comma meantone chromatic<br/>&gt;  scale and the overarching meantone temperament. The<br/>&gt;  quarter-comma meantone scale is a specific scale formed from a<br/>&gt;  specific tuning of the abstract meantone temperament, and<br/>&gt;  MET-24 is a specific scale formed from a specific tuning of<br/>&gt;  the abstract parapyth temperament.</p><p>Yes, I understand this usage, but suspect that &quot;quarter-comma is<br/>a a specific scale or tuning of the meantone family, and MET-24<br/>of the parapyth subfamily of the gentle family&quot; might be more<br/>intuitive. Either is logically correct, however.</p><p>&gt;  There a few different ways to state this relationship:</p><p>This is a nice summary and set of alternatives to consider!</p><p>&gt;  - MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific tuning of &quot;Parapyth<br/>&gt;  temperament&quot; (general common usage)</p><p>Yes, just as we speak of &quot;meantone temperament.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  - MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific tuning of &quot;the<br/>&gt;  Parapyth abstract regular temperament&quot; (using Gene&apos;s abstract<br/>&gt;  regular temperament terminology)</p><p>Gene&apos;s concept is very clear, although not necessarily the way I<br/>would speak myself as a liberal arts major. :)</p><p>But with meantone, for example, that definitive article &quot;_the_<br/>abstract regular temperament&quot; might raise certain complications.</p><p>Specifically, around Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone or the POTE,<br/>about 696.2 cents, we get 13/8 from the regular major sixth less<br/>the 12-note diesis -- is this 15 fifths up? Yes, Scala confirms<br/>that it is.</p><p>But in 1/5-comma or thereabouts at 697.7 cents, we get 13/8 from<br/>minor sixth plus a much smaller 12-note comma, which I guess<br/>would be 16 fourths up. Yes, Scala confirms this also.</p><p>They are the same &quot;abstract temperament&quot; for 5 at 4 fifths up,<br/>but evidently different for 13.</p><p>If we focus only on 5, they share this common pathway; but the<br/>pathways for 13 are a bit different, so it&apos;s not so clear that<br/>they are &quot;the same abstract temperament,&quot; although they both<br/>belong to the meantone family (a concept which really developed<br/>before European theorists were much concerned with 13).</p><p>&gt;  - MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific temperament within<br/>&gt;  &quot;the Parapyth temperament family&quot; (Paul&apos;s usage)</p><p>Very natural and intuitive -- my favorite!</p><p>&gt;  - MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific temperament that belongs to<br/>&gt;  &quot;the Parapyth temperament class&quot; (Graham&apos;s usage)</p><p>Quite intuitive also; but somehow family seems a bit more relaxed<br/>and down at home.</p><p>&gt;  - MET-24 is a 24-note scale in a specific temperament exhibiting to<br/>&gt;  &quot;the Parapyth temperament pathway&quot; (what you just proposed)</p><p>Here I should clarify that a &quot;pathway&quot; as I would see it is a<br/>strategy for getting one variety of interval: e.g. &quot;10 fourths up<br/>is the pathway to 11/10 in HTT or MET-24 or Graham&apos;s 46-17-41<br/>temperament; but by 704 cents or higher, when this pathway yields<br/>an interval or 160 cents or less, we have really moved out of the<br/>11/10 zone.&quot;</p><p>So Parapyth would be a set of pathways that are part of the<br/>intentional design or schema, plus others that are unintended but<br/>also present in the structure; e.g., in MET-24, 9 fourths up plus<br/>spacing (867.2 + 57.4 cents) yields at two locations 924.609<br/>cents, a virtually just 29/17 (924.622 cents). And we know about<br/>the near-5/3 at 887.1 cents.</p><p>&gt;  People have often argued over which of these is &quot;right&quot;; at<br/>&gt;  this point I&apos;ll just call it whatever anyone wants! (If you<br/>&gt;  want to incorporate a mapping for ratios of 5, then you can<br/>&gt;  replace &quot;Parapyth&quot; with Pele above.)</p><p>Yes, and &quot;Pele-compatible&quot; would be my term to convey this -- or,<br/>more specifically, &quot;Pele-expandable&quot; (from 24 to 34 or 58, say).</p><p>[To be continued]</p></div><h3><a id=105166 href="#105166">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2012 10:32:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; My warmest thanks to Gene or whoever did the Xenwiki pages on<br/>&gt; Gentle and its comma of 364:363!

I&apos;m delighted by these names, &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; and find it simplest and best to regard the three families I &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; originally proposed as in fact subfamilies of Gentle.</p><p>&gt; Of course, I got the idea from you. :)</p><p>Great, and I love that naming of 364:363 as the &quot;gentle comma&quot;!</p><p>To provide a framework for answering some of your questions, I should maybe start by defining a few characteristics of the Gentle<br/>family in general that apply to its subfamilies as well.</p><p>    (1) The tempering of the fifths is &quot;gentle,&quot; which means<br/>        not more than 3.045 cents at the upper bound for the linear<br/>        generator, 705.0 cents, where 9/7 is virtually pure.<br/>        The lower limit is 29-EDO or 703.447 cents.</p><p>    (2) All Gentle subfamilies and their tunings will temper out<br/>        896:891, 352:351, 364:363 (the gentle comma), and<br/>        10648:10647. The pathway to 14/11 is 4 fifths up, while the<br/>        pathway to 13/11 is 3 fourths up.</p><p>If I&apos;m correct, any regular tuning that meets (1) should also meet<br/>(2). At the low end of Gentle and the Parapyth subfamily, we are<br/>closest to 22:26:33 in JI; in the upper range of Parapyth near<br/>Peppermint or your Cantonpenta, 14/11 and 13/11 are about equally<br/>impure; in the ChristmasEve family (which I&apos;m leaning to revise to<br/>704.2-704.5 cents), 14/11 is at or near just and 3 generators is about<br/>midway between 13/11 and 33/28; in Bi-apotomic (704.5-705.0 cents), we<br/>are closest to 22:28:33 in JI.</p><p>Interestingly, 288-EDO supports Gentle with its available generator of<br/>704.167 cents, or 169 steps. Two chains of these generators with a<br/>spacing of 58.333 cents (14 steps) gives a rank-3 system quite similar<br/>to Peppermint.</p><p>So Gentle is basically the undecimal/tredecimal eventone continuum for<br/>14/13 and 13/11, analogous to meantone for 5/4 and 6/5, or superpyth<br/>for 9/7 and 7/6.</p><p>By eventone I mean a generalized term for meantones (5/4 and 6/5) and<br/>other regular tunings with an analogous structure but different ratios<br/>sought with 3 and 4 generators: thus an Archyan eventone seeks 9/7 and<br/>7/6, while an undecimal/tredecimal eventone seeks 14/11 and 13/11.</p><p>&gt;&gt; There&apos;s another comma tempered out: 441/440!</p><p>&gt; Which tunings or scales have 441/440 tempered out?</p><p>First, I should admit with due humility that while I take an interest<br/>in commas, I&apos;m hardly a tuning-math expert, and welcome the chance to<br/>get an analysis of the commas in these systems from people who really<br/>know what they are doing on the fine points. But some dialogue may<br/>help in answering some of these questions and sharing the information<br/>which may help you and me in seeking the answers to others.</p><p>What I had in mind was the region around Peppermint, where a single<br/>tempered interval of 367.235 cents, for example, represents both 26/21<br/>and 21/17, a difference of 441/440.</p><p>While both these ratios will be represented by a single tempered<br/>interval more generally through all of Parapyth, if I&apos;m right, the<br/>441/440 unison vector might be especially relevant where 8 fifths up<br/>is somewhere between 26/21 and 21/17.</p><p>And likewise, in MET-24, for example (703.711 cents), in its smoothed<br/>2048-EDO version (generator 1201/2048 octave), 9 fifths up or 333.398<br/>cents represents both 63/52 and 17/14.</p><p>Also, from another perspective, in MET-24 we have Ibn Sina&apos;s comma of<br/>2080/2079 tempered out, here the difference between 63/52 and 40/33,<br/>both again represented by 333.390 cents. In Ibn Sina (980-1037), the<br/>very small difference is noted between 14/13 and 320/297, although<br/>without giving the actual ratio for this comma.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I should add that a convincing 11/10 is possible in Parapyth from<br/>&gt;&gt; 29-EDO up to O3 or 1/5-kleisma (i.e. 896/891^1/5 with 22/21 just),<br/>&gt;&gt; but by Peppermint it&apos;s not really there: we have more of a 23/21 or<br/>&gt;&gt; whatever (159.044 cents). So it&apos;s in lower Parapyth that we have<br/>&gt;&gt; 11:10 as well as 12:11, 13:12, and 14:13 all as goals in the<br/>&gt;&gt; optimization</p><p>&gt;&gt; Does O3 assume 352/351 and 364/363 are tempered out, and what else might it<br/>&gt;&gt; assume? In particular, is it a 2.3.7.11.13 system?</p><p>Absolutely yes on both! All Gentle family tunings temper our 352/351<br/>and 364/363, by definition; and O3 is a member of the Parapyth<br/>subfamily of Gentle, defined in its &quot;smoothed&quot; version as the rank-3<br/>Parapyth tuning (2/1, 703.893, 57.148), i.e. a just 22/21 and 7/4.</p><p>Any rank-3 Parapyth system is 2.3.7.11.13 by definition, with a linear<br/>generator range for which I&apos;m now inclined to set the upper bound<br/>slightly higher, say 703.447-704.2 cents. That includes the 288-EDO<br/>version of (2/1, 704.167, 58.333).</p><p>In these tunings, 12:13:14 and 11:12:13 are generally quite accurate,<br/>with 169/168 and 144/143 definitely observed.</p><p>Let me list a few Gentle temperaments, to which your Cantonpenta could<br/>be added as a kind of subset of a 34-note or 17x2 Parapyth with<br/>generators in 271-EDO of 271, 159, and 13 steps. If this is correct,<br/>the rank-3 version would be (2/1, 704.059, 57.565 cents).</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Gentle temperament family tunings (703.447 cents - 705.0 cents)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Subfamily 1: Parapyth, usually rank-3 (703.447-~704.200 cents)<br/>................................................................</p><p>George Secor&apos;s 29-HTT, secor29htt.scl     (2/1, 703.579, 58.090)<br/>pure 63/52 and 7/4<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/secor29htt.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/secor29htt.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>MET-24, my Milder Extended Temperament    (2/1, 703.771, 57.422)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-canonical.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-canonical.scl</a>&gt;<br/>14/11 and 11/10 about equally impure, 7/4 near-just (2048-EDO)</p><p>Graham Breed&apos;s computer 46-17-41          (2/1, 703.723, 57.423)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46-17-41&limit=2_3_7_11_13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46-17-41&limit=2_3_7_11_13</a>&gt;</p><p>O3, my just 22/21 tuning with pure 7/4    (2/1, 703.893, 57.148)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O3-reg-24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O3-reg-24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>Cantonpenta(?) rank-3 (2x17, 271-EDO)     (2/1, 704.059, 57.565)<br/>Superset of Gene Ward Smith Cantonpenta<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/cantonpentalike34.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/cantonpentalike34.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>Peppermint, Kennan Pepper&apos;s Noble Fifth   (2/1, 704.096, 58.680)<br/>in rank-3 (2x12) with just 7/6 schulter_pepr.scl<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/schulter_pepr.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/schulter_pepr.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>288-EDO rank-3 tuning                     (2/1, 704.167, 58.333)<br/>(virtually just 7/6, 266.667 cents)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/parapyth_288-edo.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/parapyth_288-edo.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Subfamily 2: ChristmasEve (704.2-704.5 cents), mostly rank-2<br/>................................................................</p><p>Pure 14/11 tuning                (2/1, 704.377 cents)<br/>Just above 46-EDO<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/christmas_eve24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/christmas_eve24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Subfamily 3: Bi-apotomic, usually rank-2 (704.5 - 705.0 cents)<br/>................................................................</p><p>e-based tuning, Blackwood&apos;s R = e               (2/1, 704.607)<br/>15 fifths up is near-pure 7/4<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/neogeb24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/neogeb24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>minimax 2-3-7-9 tuning with pure 7/6            (2/1, 704.776)<br/>Minutely above 63-EDO<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/biapotomic_septimal24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/biapotomic_septimal24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>tuning for virtually pure 9/7                   (2/1, 705.000)<br/>synonymous with 80-EDO<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/reg705_24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/reg705_24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>===============================================================</p><p>   &gt; For ChristmasEve, running from 704.136 cents to 704.5 cents:<br/>   &gt;<br/>   &gt; (1) Go for the eigenmonzo, 704.377 cents, making 14/11 and<br/>   &gt; 11/7 just.</p><p>&gt;  Can you say what ChristmasEve tempers out?</p><p>First, I&apos;m inclined, as just mentioned, to make that 704.2-704.5<br/>cents. Exactly what it tempers out is an interesting question --<br/>beyond, of course, what all of Gentle tempers out, namely the 896/891,<br/>352/351, 364/363, and 10648/10647.</p><p>This is a rank-2 system, whereas Parapyth is classically rank-3<br/>although a rank-2 variation is possible, where the mapping beyond a<br/>12-MOS is different. I often tend to think of cents for a given<br/>shading, or nearby ratios, rather than commas -- but maybe we can pin<br/>down some commas together.</p><p>The easy answer is that, if we consider ChristmasEve to be septimal<br/>(as it is for 14 or especially 15 generators), then what gets tempered<br/>out is the 169/168, observed in rank-3 Parapyth (14/13 vs. 13/12).</p><p>With ChristmasEve, I&apos;d say that 13 generators down map to a tempered<br/>128/99, while 14 are in the suburbs of 7/6, and 15 give a much more<br/>accurate 7/4. Note that 128/99 is equal to 9/7 plus 896/891.</p><p>Now 128/99 is equal to 4/3 less 33/32. And if this were Pythagoren,<br/>then 13 fifths down or fourths up would give 4/3 less a Pythagorean<br/>comma, of course. So this ChristmasEve comma at around a pure 14/11<br/>tuning (704.377 cents) or the almost identical 46-EDO may be defined<br/>as the 180224/177147, which I note has the same denominator as the<br/>famous Pythagorean wolf fifth 262144/177147.</p><p>For 14 or 15 generators at a pure 14/11 tuning, where the pathway is<br/>to 7, our comma is equal to the difference between 28/27 and the<br/>Pythagorean comma, 531441/524288, or 14680064/14348907 (39.501<br/>cents).</p><p>ChristmasEve is the 2.3.7.11.13 version of lower Leapday, more or less<br/>-- because from a neomedieval perspective, 443 cents is better viewed<br/>as a good 128/99 than a quite inaccurate 9/7; while the 7/6 at this<br/>point, around 704.377 cents, is still well over 5 cents narrow. So<br/>it&apos;s a mixture of interseptimal and septimal, in contrast to the<br/>optimized septimal of Bi-apotomic-7/6. On interseptimal intervals, see</p><p>  &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt; For Bi-apotomic-7/6, at 704.5-705.0 cents:</p><p>&gt;  Same question for Bi-apotomic.</p><p>The four basic commas of Gentle (896/891, 352/351, 364/363,<br/>10648/10647) plus, above all, the 14680064/14348907!</p><p>This region of 704.5-705.0 cents has 13-14-15 generators as accurate<br/>pathways to 9/7, 7/6, and 7/4. In Pythagorean, these would be,<br/>respectively, 21/16, 7/4, and 7/6 impure in each case by a 3-7 schisma<br/>(64/63 less 531441/524288) at around 3.804 cents. So the comma is<br/>equal to 49/48 plus the 3-7 schisma, or 14680064/14348907.</p><p>Another very important comma tempered out, as with ChristmasEve, is<br/>the 169/168, maybe best illustrated by the minimax tuning at 704.776<br/>cents, where 7/6 is just, formed from two apotomes at (7/6)^(1/2).</p><p>&gt;&gt; True! Temperament families and subfamilies are very natural for<br/>&gt;&gt; me, and classes and subclasses pretty much equivalent. I like<br/>&gt;&gt; families because it reminds me of biological taxonomy, and has a<br/>&gt;&gt; friendly sound.</p><p>&gt;  I like things whose precise definition I understand, which is why I<br/>&gt;  like abstract temperaments.</p><p>This is an area where you are much more acquainted with these commas,<br/>let alone Fokker blocks, that I am. So deciding which commas are<br/>tempered out might be a dialogue, where I can explain about the<br/>tunings but you might identify new commas of which I wasn&apos;t aware.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes, I understand this usage, but suspect that &quot;quarter-comma is a<br/>&gt;&gt; a specific scale or tuning of the meantone family, and MET-24 of<br/>&gt;&gt; the parapyth subfamily of the gentle family&quot; might be more<br/>&gt;&gt; intuitive. Either is logically correct, however.</p><p>&gt; But what does it mean? What, precisely, are the definitions<br/>&gt; involved?</p><p>Actually it&apos;s a bit impressionistic. But I&apos;d say that the Gentle<br/>family tempers enough to get intervals of 7-11 generators to their<br/>values in 29-EDO, fairly near 26/21 and 63/52 and at least 13-14 cents<br/>from 5/4 and 6/5, for example, with 13/11 close to just; and no more<br/>than required for 13 generators to produce a just 9/7 (allowing a tiny<br/>overshoot to draw the boundary neatly at 705.0 cents).</p><p>So, to me, it&apos;s more like defining an historical era or period, for<br/>example in music history, than an exact mathematical science. But it<br/>is, of course, subject to mathematical analysis.</p><p>It may be analogous to a partnership between the composer who writes<br/>by intuition in good part, and the analyst who looks for patterns.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; Specifically, around Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone or the POTE,<br/>  &gt;&gt; about 696.2 cents, we get 13/8 from the regular major sixth less<br/>  &gt;&gt; the 12-note diesis -- is this 15 fifths up? Yes, Scala confirms<br/>  &gt;&gt; that it is.</p><p>&gt;  If 13 is not a part of the abstract regular temperament, it says<br/>&gt;  exactly nothing about what 13/8 is. It isn&apos;t anything, since the<br/>&gt;  definitions are in no way based on actual tuning. The idea here is<br/>&gt;  that &quot;abstract&quot; really does mean abstract.  You have notes, but to<br/>&gt;  play the notes you need a tuning. It&apos;s like a score--if you have a<br/>&gt;  score for a piece in meantone, you can&apos;t actually play it until you<br/>&gt;  decide on a tuning.</p><p>I get the idea that the &quot;abstract temperament&quot; may of course choose to<br/>map some primes and not others, even if they accidentally arise, like<br/>a near-13/8 in 1/5-comma.</p><p>And that&apos;s analogous, then, to MET-24, where the abstract temperament<br/>is 2.3.7.11.13, although it happens that 5 does come up at a few<br/>locations, and 29/17 also, as Mike and I have been discussing.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105173 href="#105173">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2012 2:49:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Mike,</p><p>Here I&apos;m picking up the dialogue from my last post, with the small<br/>revision that I might draw the line between Parapyth and ChristmasEve<br/>at around 704.2 cents. Among other things, this permits the 288-EDO<br/>realization of rank-3 Parapyth at (2/1, 704.167, 58.333 cents).</p><p>Please forgive me if I&apos;m being a bit repetitive on the Gentle family<br/>(as aptly proposed by Gene!) and its subfamilies, but your question<br/>about what&apos;s a name for a tuning or a family suggested that it might<br/>not hurt to go over this. Maybe a bit of dialogue may help clarify or<br/>possibly revise certain boundaries.</p><p>&gt;  The &quot;Equal Temperament Mappings&quot; thing is complicated and not very<br/>&gt;  useful; it&apos;s the &quot;Reduced Mapping&quot; that&apos;s useful. Each row<br/>&gt;  represents a different generator, and each column of the matrix<br/>&gt;  represents a different prime, and this tells you how many of each<br/>&gt;  generator you need to add to represent a certain prime. But if you<br/>&gt;  have a more clever way in mind of specifying the temperament, how<br/>&gt;  would you do it?  What&apos;s a good systematic way to display, for some<br/>&gt;  arbitrary temperament, where the relevant tempered commas &quot;turn up&quot;<br/>&gt;  that&apos;s easily readable by a human being?</p><p>Certainly mapping primes is one useful appraach. The complications<br/>come, for example, when we&apos;re aiming for something other than a prime,<br/>like &quot;an interseptimal major third around 128/99&quot; or &quot;a Phi-sixth.&quot;<br/>For optimization, it would be nice to recognize these as goals in<br/>themselves, rather than inaccurate forms of 7 or 13.</p><p>In Parapyth, of course, we are aiming mostly at primes, and quite<br/>accurately at that! But things like the Phi-sixth or a bright neutral<br/>or submajor third around 26/21 or 21/17 might perhaps be served by<br/>some notation which could be used together with that of primes.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The POTE instantiation of the Pele pathway, however, is _not_ an<br/>&gt;&gt; optimization of 13/11 and 14/11 (in contrast to 33/26), since 13/11<br/>&gt;&gt; is still substantially wide of just, so a bit more temperament will<br/>&gt;&gt; bring them both closer to pure.</p><p>&gt; Right, this optimizes each interval in order of its complexity<br/>&gt; (specified by n*d for some ratio n/d). You can think of this as<br/>&gt; optimizing the average tuning of -all- intervals over the entire JI<br/>&gt; lattice, with the most weight is placed on really simple intervals<br/>&gt; like 3/2, 5/4, and so on. 14/11 and 13/11 have medium complexity and<br/>&gt; as such get medium weight, whereas something like 32805/32768 gets<br/>&gt; barely no weight assigned to it at all, because it&apos;s so complex that<br/>&gt; it gets minimal attention. That&apos;s one way to think of it, anyway.<br/>&gt; If you&apos;d prefer to weight intervals differently, which ones would<br/>&gt; you say are most important? Is there some mathematical pattern<br/>&gt; inherent in the intervals you&apos;d like to optimize, so we can apply<br/>&gt; this method of optimization to all temperaments?</p><p>Well, POTE (or TOP) seems one way to seek out a likely solution which<br/>can serve both as a good tuning and a point of departure for others.<br/>Another approach might be to &quot;go for the eigenmonzo,&quot; or for some<br/>point where two intervals of interest are equally impure, or a for a<br/>minimax which could also be an eigenmonzo point, like a just 7/6<br/>making 9/7 and 7/4 as impure as the fifth.</p><p>An interesting point is the 13-limit Leapday family divides into two<br/>families for 2.3.7.11.13: ChristmasEve (704.2-704.5 cents), where 13<br/>generators up is at least as close to 128/99 or the like as to 9/7;<br/>and Bi-apotomic (704.5-705.0 cents) where 9/7, 7/6, and 7/4 are all<br/>more accurate from 13-14-15 generators. The ideal Bi-apotomic tuning<br/>is 704.776 cents, where an apotome is equal to (7/6)^(1/2).</p><p>Now when I first read of Leapday, I wondered how a pure 14/11 major<br/>third (a great eigenmonzo in itself, of course) or 46-EDO could be an<br/>optimization for 7 when tempering a bit more would improve 9/7, 7/6,<br/>and 7/4 as well. Then I realized: these people are also weighing 5,<br/>and maybe more than either 14/11 or 9/7 or even 7/6! That quickly<br/>explained a lot!</p><p>To put the matter concisely, for Parapyth, ChristmasEve, or<br/>Bi-apotomic, it&apos;s a matter of indifference whether 21 fifths up gives<br/>a third of 392 cents (as around a pure 14/11, 704.377 cents), or 400<br/>cents (as around the pure 7/6 tuning). But in Leapday, which is<br/>definitely going for 5, that&apos;s a counterbalance to going much beyond<br/>46-EDO.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m not sure how 196/195 turns up, specifically; there&apos;s actually<br/>&gt;  an infinite series of commas tempered out, and 196/195 is<br/>&gt;  apparently one of them. I was just mentioning the simplest interval<br/>&gt;  that you&apos;d have to add to the set of vanishing commas which would<br/>&gt;  transform Parapyth into Pele. You could add 441/440 instead and get<br/>&gt;  the same thing, or 847/845. It was just a technical note.</p><p>The 196/195 is something I think I understand as a fortuitous aspect<br/>of MET-24 -- the tempering out of this comma, that is.</p><p>Note that 14/13 (128.298 cents) is always within three cents of just<br/>in the 1024-EDO version (125.4 or 126.6 cents), Likewise 7/6 is<br/>consistently just over two cents narrow (264.844 cents). So 14/13 and<br/>7/6 are each a little bit narrow.</p><p>Now there&apos;s a form of the Hijaz tetrachord -- here 126.6-264.8-105.5<br/>cents or Bb-B-C#*-Eb -- that&apos;s rather close a just 14/13-7/6-52/49 or<br/>128.3-266.9-103.9 cents, or 1/1-14/13-49/39-4/3 (0-128.3-395.2-498.0<br/>cents). This is the series 39:42:49:52.</p><p>         126.6    264.8    105.5<br/>MET-24  0    126.6      391.4  496.9<br/>       Bb      B         C#*     Eb<br/>       39     42         49      52<br/>      1/1    14/13      49/39   4/3<br/>JI:    0     128.3      395.2  498.0<br/>        128.3     266.9    103.9</p><p>Now the 196/195 is the difference between 49/39 and 5/4, about 8.855<br/>cents. Because both 14/13 and 7/6 are narrow, it happens that this<br/>absorbs some of the comma, making 5/4 and especially 6/5 considerably<br/>closer to just. It&apos;s really an accident. although someone wanting to<br/>focus on 5 and expand the temperament structure could get Pele from<br/>it.</p><p>Now I&apos;ve found that 352/351 + 441/440 equals 196/195, although I&apos;m not<br/>sure how this would be used in an actual tuning. But I would say that<br/>evidently MET-24 does temper out the 196/195, and is thus a<br/>Pele-compatible or Pele-expandable member of Parapyth.</p><p>&gt;  If we want to not include 5/4 and 6/5 in the optimization, we can<br/>&gt;  just go back to looking at Parapyth and skip this noise about<br/>&gt;  Pele. So POTE Parapyth has the fifth at 703.857 cents and the<br/>&gt;  spacing interval at 58.338 cents. This tunes 14/11 to 415.425 cents<br/>&gt;  and 13/11 to 288.431 cents. The general &quot;weighted average of all<br/>&gt;  intervals&quot; optimization mentioned before still applies, except now<br/>&gt;  we&apos;re excluding ratios where 5 is involved.</p><p>This is very close to a just 22/21 or O3, and also seems to be the<br/>region of Parapyth that Gene, I believe, has termed Pentacenter.<br/>I&apos;m not sure if Pentacenter is a specific tuning or more of a<br/>subregion of Parapyth where 22/21 is close to just.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes, in that sense the spacing comma, i.e. limma less spacing,<br/>&gt;&gt; represents both 81/80 (or maybe 66/65 if the regular major third is<br/>&gt;&gt; 33/26, actually a tad closer than 14/11) and the 64/63 (or also<br/>&gt;&gt; 78/77, e.g. 13/11 and 7/6).</p><p>&gt;  Looks right to me; limma minus spacing represents 81/80, 66/65,<br/>&gt;  64/63, and 78/77, by my calculations.</p><p>Great!</p><p>&gt;  Hmm, if C-C### is mapped to 5/4, that corresponds to a 5-limit<br/>&gt;  temperament tempering out 10737418240/10460353203. See here:<br/>&gt;  [48]<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=5</a> Looks like<br/>&gt;  the 13-limit version of this is called &quot;Leapday&quot; temperament:<br/>&gt;  [49]<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46_29&limit=13</a> What limit<br/>&gt;  is the Pepper Noble Fifth tuning in?</p><p>Well, the basic Pepper Noble Fifth is rank-2 at (2/1, 704.096), so<br/>with an open tuning, the &quot;limit&quot; maybe in the eye or ear of the<br/>beholder, as you&apos;ve pointed out also. But this is very close an<br/>eigonmonzo of 5/4, with the apotome at (5/4)^(1/3). The magic spot is<br/>704.110177 cents. Of course, as with Leapday, this implies a useful<br/>MOS for 5 of 29 or larger. And in something like Peppermint-58, this<br/>would happen also within each 29-MOS chain.</p><p>But it wouldn&apos;t in Peppermint-34, unlike MET-34, because here the<br/>best pathway to 5 is within a single chain (21 fifths up), while, as<br/>we&apos;ve discussed, in MET-34 it would be the spacing comma (Pele&apos;s<br/>pathway, if I&apos;m correct).</p><p>&gt;  Sorry, I&apos;m confused now - what&apos;s the end specification of the<br/>&gt;  e-based pathway, and the HTT pathway? Which limits are these<br/>&gt;  temperaments in, and how are the various primes mapped? If you<br/>&gt;  posted something back in 2000 or so that we&apos;ve assigned a different<br/>&gt;  name to, then you get precedence, but I&apos;m still not sure which of<br/>&gt;  HTT, e-based, MET, O3, parapyth, etc you consider to be generalized<br/>&gt;  mappings, or very specific tunings, or specific tunings of specific<br/>&gt;  scales, etc. It seems like some of these are different names for<br/>&gt;  different tunings of the same underlying temperament or temperament<br/>&gt;  &quot;pathway&quot;, whereas others are names for different &quot;pathways&quot;<br/>&gt;  themselves.</p><p>One important thing is that it&apos;s easy to say, &quot;I&apos;ve designed what<br/>might be a new tuning.&quot; It may be a bit harder, however, to conclude,<br/>&quot;Well, this seems to be not only a new tuning, but a new temperament<br/>family as well.&quot; HIstorical perspective often helps.</p><p>To clarify: George Secor&apos;s High Tolerance Temperament family beginning<br/>with 29-HTT (1978) has a 2.3.7.11.13 subset which served as a<br/>prototype for rank-3 Parapyth: Peppermint (2002, based on the Pepper<br/>Noble Fifth linear generator of 704.096 cents), O3 (2010), MET-24<br/>(2011), Graham&apos;s computer-created 46-17-41 tuning, etc. These are all<br/>members of the Parapyth subfamily of the larger family Gene has very<br/>felicitously named Gentle (703.447-705.0 cents).</p><p>Now what all rank-3 Parapyth tunings share is a pathway to ratios of<br/>2-3-7-9 through 1-2-3 generators plus or minus spacing for 9/7, 7/6,<br/>and 7/4 respectively. That is what I termed the &quot;HTT pathway&quot; to honor<br/>George Secor&apos;s germinal example which I learned about from George in<br/>2001, and in 2002 eagerly applied to Peppermint, and since to other<br/>shadings of Parapyth: it&apos;s more generally the Parapyth pathway to 7.</p><p>In 2000, I announced the e-based tuning, a rank-2 system (2/1, 704.607), and a few months later excitedly discovered that 15 fifths up is a virtually just 7/4. Now I propose that e-based<br/>is one prototype for the Bi-apotomic subfamily of Gentle, where the<br/>apotome or chromatic semitone is very close to (7/6)^(1/2). This runs<br/>from around 704.5 to 705.0 cents, with 13-14-15 generators in a single<br/>chain yielding approximations of 9/7, 7/6, and 7/4.</p><p>In 2000, I also announced a 12-MOS with a just 14/11 major third<br/>(704.377 cents), and an optional 17-note circulating version adding<br/>five remote notes to this 12-MOS. Here our interest is in a regular<br/>rank-2 tuning at around 704.2-704.5 cents, with the 14/11 eigenmonzo<br/>as an obvious point of attraction, I now call ChristmasEve, suggesting<br/>a full tuning set of 24 and a 12-MOS, or 12/24 (the date style in<br/>the UK of 24/12 for Christmas Eve is fine also).</p><p>Now ChristmasEve is a playful allusion to Leapday -- the difference is<br/>a focus on 2.3.7.11.13 rather than 13-limit. From my perspective, this<br/>ChristmasEve subfamily of Gentle is transitional between Parapyth,<br/>where an independent spacing generator is needed to get near 7; and<br/>Bi-apotomic, where the 12-tone diesis can serve as the natural spacing<br/>and get us there rather nicely, especially from 704.6 cents on up.</p><p>The distinctive feature of rank-2 ChristmasEve is that 13 generators<br/>actually yields a large major third at around 443 cents for the pure<br/>14/11 tuning, nicely representing 128/99 or the like rather than 9/7;<br/>but 14 and 15 generators are reasonabl close to 7/6 and 7/4. So it&apos;s a<br/>kind of charming compromise between septimal and what I term<br/>interseptimal, with each part of the spectrum having its own value.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>From the informal term &quot;gentle temperaments&quot; that I used in 2002 to<br/>describe systems with fifths tempered around 704 cents, regular thirds<br/>near 14/11 and 13/11, and lots of neutral and septimal (or sometimes<br/>interseptimal) intervals in rank-2 or rank-3 sizes like 17 or 24, Gene<br/>suggested the name Gentle, which I enthusiastically embrace!</p><p>A quick description of the Gentle family as a whole would note a range<br/>of about 703.447-705.0 cents; for those oriented to EDO landmarks,<br/>this would be from 29-EDO to 80-EDO. A 2.3.7.11.13 orientation is the<br/>other defining element of this family, with its undecimal-tredecimal<br/>regular intervals (e.g. 14/11, 13/11, 22/21); neutral intervals<br/>(e.g. 14/13, 26/21, 13/12, 13/8); and septimal or interseptimal<br/>intervals (e.g. 9/7, 7/6, 7/4, 21/16; or, in rank-2 Parapyth or<br/>ChristmasEve, shadings around 128/99, 297/256, 15/13, 13/10, etc.).</p><p>Gentle is the heartland of what in 2000 I termed &quot;neo-Gothic tunings,&quot;<br/>and after George Secor in 2001-2002 had directed my attention to<br/>medieval and later Near Eastern music, now more broadly term<br/>&quot;neomedieval.&quot; The variety of neutral steps, with four sizes in rank-3<br/>Parapyth and two in rank-2 systems, makes it very attractive for Near<br/>Eastern music.</p><p>One neomedieval motto: &quot;Neomedieval needs 5 like a fish needs a<br/>bicycle.&quot; This isn&apos;t to exclude the extra diversity of 5 when it<br/>occurs, only to say that it&apos;s incidental, and that Gentle tunings are<br/>not likely to suit 5-limit tonal harmony.</p><p>So the ethos of Gentle and its sufamilies is to be gentle in tempering<br/>the fifth and fourth (especially in Parapyth, where the tempering is<br/>about equal to 12n-EDO, or a bit less in HTT and MET-24, for example);<br/>and to favor different types of rather active and complex thirds and<br/>sixths that can resolve to stable intervals such as unisons or fifths<br/>in directed progressions of a kind emblematic of 13th-14th century<br/>European music based on Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p><p>[to be continued]</p></div><h3><a id=105174 href="#105174">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2012 2:55:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 29 Oct 2012, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here the totally independent and identical results are<br/>&gt; intriguing: maybe like a chess match between Susan Pulgar and<br/>&gt; Deep Blue (a famous computer program of the mid-1990&apos;s) which<br/>&gt; ends in a classic draw by perpetual check.</p><p>That should be Susan Polgar; I don&apos;t how I managed to spell<br/>the name of this Grandmaster wrong, but the least I can do<br/>is a quick correction.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105175 href="#105175">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2012 3:32:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi All</p><p>I got to say this didn&apos;t work out too well to my ears.

So<br/>that&apos;s part of the answer.</p><p>But remember, parapyth and gentle more generally temper out 896:891,<br/>352:351, 364:363, and 10648:10647. So 57.423 cents (in my first<br/>&quot;canonical&quot; version of MET-24, of which I now suspect I could have<br/>mistakenly had a 17-note subset loaded in Scala when I thought it was<br/>Graham&apos;s computed parapyth POTE or the like) represents not only<br/>28/27, but lots else.</p><p>For one, 91/88: the difference between 44/39 and 7/6, or 22/13 and<br/>7/4. A beautiful example is Secor&apos;s 29-HTT, where 22/13 is within<br/>1/20-cent or so of just, and 7/4 is pure, so the spacing of 58.090<br/>cents is also a near-just 91/88. That&apos;s the textbook illustration,<br/>where everything is just about infinitessimally close to JI.<br/>Note that the difference of 28/27 and 91/88 is 352/351, a very<br/>important unison vector for the whole gentle family.</p><p>For another, 33/32, very notably, for example, the difference between<br/>4/3 (one fourth up) and 11/8 (one fourth up plus spacing). Now 33/32<br/>is equal to 28/27 less 896/891, another basic unison vector for all of<br/>gentle.</p><p>For yet another, 121/117, the difference between 13/11 and 11/9, both<br/>of which these temperaments tend to get quite accurately as three<br/>fourths up, and three fourths up plus spacing.</p><p>And the 121/117 gives a great illustration of three of our four basic<br/>commas for the gentle family.

For example, a<br/>39:42:49:52 Hijaz of the kind I mentioned to Mike is fine as a<br/>special effect; but attempts to use MET-24 for any kind of<br/>5-limit style are apt to run into the rather comical scarcity of<br/>these intervals for that purpose.</p><p>While 11:10 neutral thirds were part of the design, 5/4 and 5/3<br/>were incidental effects neither optimized for nor deliberately<br/>avoided.  And note that 11/10 (162.891 cents) is considerably<br/>closer to just than 5/4 (390.820 cents), whereas an RMP scheme<br/>going for 5/4 would presumably optimize differently.</p><p>And from my point of view, the results here and in O3 are mostly<br/>musically interchangeable. The main difference is that MET-24 is<br/>kinder on the fifths, especially in 1024-EDO where six of 11 in<br/>each 12-MOS are impure by only 1.17 cents.</p><p>And since 11/10 is a part of the optimization while 5/4 isn&apos;t,<br/>applying a POTE model for purposes of classification could<br/>distract from the musically most relevant analysis. This happens<br/>to theorists and composers of various eras, for example when<br/>modern writers try to read major/minor tonality into 13th-14th<br/>century European music.</p><p>The &quot;pele-compatible&quot; or &quot;pele-expandable&quot; label neatly resolves<br/>this and avoids lots of arguments.</p><p>Best.</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105193 href="#105193">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2012 2:01:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Since your JI version, or &quot;transversal&quot;, of MET-24 contains<br/>&gt; 5-limit intervals it seems to me that &quot;definately&quot; is awfully<br/>&gt; strong.

That&apos;s why it&apos;s indeed pele-compatible, although<br/>someone who wants it to be pele-effective would probably expand<br/>the design to 34 or more notes.</p><p>&gt; The POTE parapyth tuning of 91/88 is 58.338 cents, again for<br/>&gt; what that&apos;s worth, but I see POTE pele was much closer to your<br/>&gt; value for this interval.</p><p>Let&apos;s analyze what&apos;s happening here from a neomedieval<br/>perspective, and I think that we&apos;ll find there&apos;s no independent<br/>intent to optimize 5-limit thirds -- as well as maybe find some<br/>criteria that may suggest when such intent may be present --<br/>criteria not met here. I&apos;ll address first the general tuning<br/>design, then the question of the spacing for 91/88.</p><p>With pele, as I understand it, there is in effect a compromise<br/>between two important ratios for the third or spacing generator<br/>of the rank-3 design.</p><p>For 7, we want 22/13 (typically close to just in this range for<br/>either parapyth or pele) plus 91/88 to equal 7/4, as it does in<br/>Secor&apos;s 29-HTT (703.579 cents). That&apos;s true in either parapyth or<br/>pele.</p><p>For the 5 of Pele, however -- not 11/10 as the main focus, but<br/>5-limit thirds -- we want 63/52 (just in 29-HTT) plus 65/63 to<br/>equal 5/4.</p><p>And between 91/88 and the smaller 65/63 of pele, there&apos;s a comma<br/>of 441/440.</p><p>Now there&apos;s a way to lean toward 5 as we wouldn&apos;t do in Parapyth,<br/>and we don&apos;t do in MET-24 -- temper the fifth very lightly, so<br/>that 63/52 is actually narrower than just! The reason is that the<br/>63/52 grows (and the spacing for a just 5/4 shrinks) at nine<br/>times the rate of growth for the fifth, while 22/13 grows toward<br/>7/4 at only three times this rate. In my conclusion, I&apos;ll get<br/>into this a bit more.</p><p>So POTE pele, if I have it right, has a fifth way lower than<br/>MET_24: around 703.4 cents as opposed to 703.7 cents.</p><p>In terms of the 28672/28431, which is actually the most relevant<br/>comma for MET-24 as designed (this 441/440 discussion is<br/>fascinating, but very much an afterthought), we have a tempering<br/>of about 1/8 of this Secorian comma -- meaning that 26/21 and<br/>21/13 are very close to just (370.312 and 829.688 cents, with<br/>just values at 369.747 and 830.253 cents).</p><p>For POTE pele, we want less than 1/9-Secorian comma. And that<br/>would be contrary to one of the main optimization criteria for<br/>MET-24: both 14/13 and 11/10 should be within 3 cents of just in<br/>the 1024-EDO version. In the 2048-EDO version, 11/10 is impure by<br/>2.114 cents, and 14/13 by 2.322 cents.</p><p>That&apos;s one good choice for parapyth, but not so good for pele,<br/>because it causes us to overshoot 5/4 by 4.507 cents. Note that<br/>the relevant 2.3.7.11.13 ratios, and also 11/10, generally do<br/>considerably better.</p><p>Since the linear generator is simply wrong for POTE pele, why set<br/>91/88 at 57.422 cents rather at 58.594 cents (the next available<br/>size in 1024-EDO), say?</p><p>For me, the main reason was to favor 11/8 and 13/8, albeit at the<br/>expense of 9/7 (often more of a 352/273 in the 1024-EDO version,<br/>as reflected by my JI traversal above). One result is that 7/6<br/>and 13/8 are about equally impure -- these sizes, 264.844 cents<br/>and 842.578 cents, are built from an even number of linear<br/>generators plus spacing, and so are constant in 1024-EDO also,<br/>respectively impure by 2.027 cents in the narrow direction and<br/>2.050 cents in the wide direction. So it&apos;s a classic balance for<br/>usual 2.3.7.11.13 purposes.</p><p>The POTE pele compromises lots of intervals, with 13/7 more than<br/>four cents wide, and 14/13 equally narrow -- not bad, but<br/>different from MET-24 (and a &quot;compromise&quot; only from that point<br/>of view!). And likewise with 14/11, and more subtly<br/>with 13/12 and 12/11.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that none of these things are faults,<br/>only signs that we&apos;re exploring a slightly different part of the<br/>continuum than MET-24. In fact, the POTE pele has a virtually<br/>just third that I&apos;ll mention below.</p><p>Also, this may be a rather trivial point, but Mike Battaglia&apos;s<br/>parameters for the POTE at (2/1, 703.414, 57.468) result in 7/4<br/>at always a bit more than a cent narrow -- a compromise to<br/>improve 5/4, as the POTE algorith would lead us to expect.</p><p>At MET-24 (2/1, 703.711, 57.422), the 22/13 is a bit larger<br/>rather than smaller than pure, so 57.422 (a bit narrow of a just<br/>91/88) is actually close to optimal for 7/4. In 1024-EDO, it is<br/>the only spacing to keep 7/4 always within a cent of just. That,<br/>plus the almost perfect balance between 7/6 and 13/8, are more<br/>than ample justification for its use.</p><p>In short, the MET-24 criteria of &quot;tune all four superparticular<br/>neutral seconds within three cents of just in 1024-EDO, and keep<br/>7/4 always within a cent of just&quot; would not be the best criteria<br/>if this were pele.</p><p>Another test to confirm this musical reality is to look at<br/>results with SHOW LOCATIONS 4:6:7:9:11:13, where both POTE pele<br/>and MET-24 (1024-EDO or 2048-EDO) do quite well. Then try this:<br/>SHOW LOCATIONS 4:5:6:7:9:11.</p><p>In POTE pele, 5/4 will be wide by 1.88 cents -- a tribute to the<br/>optimization for 5.</p><p>In MET-24, 5/4 will be wide by 3.921 or 5.093 cents in the<br/>1024-EDO version, and consistently by 4.507 cents in the 2048-EDO<br/>version. This makes sense for an incidental interval which the<br/>equations -- rather fascinating ones -- cast at our feet, but not<br/>for 5/4 in a 5-limit optimization of near-just quality, as MET-24<br/>seeks to maintain for 2.3.11/10.7.11.13.</p><p>To sum up, &quot;keep 7/4 always within a cent of just in 1024-EDO,<br/>and 13/8 within 2 cents or so of just&quot; is sufficient to account<br/>for the 57.422-cent spacing.</p><p>Now for the last point I promised to cover: the rates of growth<br/>for 22/13 and 63/52. Let&apos;s compare POTE pele and MET-24:</p><p>             5th   spacing   Maj6   Maj6-7/4   Aug2   Aug2-5/4<br/>POTE Pele  703.414  57.468  910.242  58.584   330.726  55.588<br/>MET-24     703.711  57.422  911.133  57.693   333.398  52.916</p><p>Note how in POTE pele, the spacing of 57.468 cents is a good<br/>compromise between the 58.584 cents we&apos;d need for a just 7/4, and<br/>the 55.588 cents we&apos;d need for a just 5/4.</p><p>In MET-24, however, an almost identical spacing of 57.422 cents<br/>is almost exactly the 57.693 cents we need for a just 7/4 with<br/>our slightly larger 22/13 -- but way beyond the 52.916 cents we&apos;d<br/>need for a just 5/4, what with the growth of our 63/52 by over<br/>2.5 cents. It fits 2.3.11/10.7.11.13 -- but 13-limit, not so<br/>much.</p><p>However, MET-24 is only one possible shading or region to<br/>explore, and the POTE pele tuning has an interval of special<br/>interest: a virtually just supraminor third at 23/19, 330.726<br/>cents as compared with a just 330.761 cents.</p><p>Indeed. we could define a near-POTE pele generator of 703.418<br/>cents or (736/19)^(1/9). Here we are tempering out the difference<br/>between the Pythagorean augmented second 19683/16384 and 23/19, a<br/>comma of 376832/373977 (13.166 cents). Thus the tempering is<br/>1.463 cents.</p><p>And here we get a superparticular comma or schisma temperaed out<br/>by 29-EDO, for example: the difference between 23/19 and 63/52,<br/>or 1197/1196 (1.447 cents). If this hasn&apos;t been named, I might<br/>propose &quot;29-EDO supraminor comma,&quot; since the actual supraminor<br/>third or augmented second (9 fifths up) is 331.034 cents, about<br/>0.273 cents wide of 23/19 and 1.174 cents narrow of 63/52<br/>(332.208 cents).</p><p>In fact, both POTE pele and MET-24 have good approximations of<br/>63/52, from different directions. Each tempering is beautiful,<br/>and I&apos;m just pointing out that the purposes and designs are a bit<br/>different.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105194 href="#105194">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2012 3:44:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Gene,</p><p>Here&apos;s another querying of the idea that MET-24 &quot;tempers out<br/>the 441/440&quot; in such a way as to make 5/4 significantly less<br/>impure than 441/352 (390.244 cents), which would be one<br/>meaningful criterion for a pele optimization. However, as I<br/>discuss below, the matter of Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic suggests<br/>that MET-24 may have some interesting properties which are yet<br/>distinct from those of pele. Let&apos;s focus for the moment on<br/>441/352.</p><p>In the 1024-EDO version of MET-24, we find the relevant interval<br/>sizes at 390.234 cents (almost identical to 441/352, 0.010 cents<br/>narrow); and 391.406 cents (1.162 cents wide).</p><p>In the 2048-EDO version, we have 390.820 cents, or 0.576 cents<br/>wide.</p><p>So, from the standpoint of optimizing prime 5 (i.e. 5/4, which I<br/>understand is what prime 5 especially refers to in POTE), we get<br/>either a virtually just 441/352, or something a tad wider. This<br/>is not an &quot;improvement&quot; of 5/4, quite unlike pele.</p><p>Now are there 2.3.7.11.13 explanations -- and keeping 11/10<br/>within three cents of just is not even a necessary explanatory<br/>factor here -- that can account for a 441/352 without any intent<br/>to optimize 5/4 and possibly sacrifice the accuracy of other<br/>intervals in order to do so (as is done in POTE pele with 14/11,<br/>certainly, and more subtly with 7/4)?</p><p>As it happens, 441/352 is the difference between 22/21 and 21/16,<br/>for example -- both 2.3.7.11.13 intervals which a neomedieval<br/>outlook and MET-24 in particular do seek to optimize. The 22/21,<br/>occuring in Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Chromatic and in various medieval<br/>Near Eastern sources, is a superparticular or epimoric limma much<br/>sought; and the 21/16 is beautiful in 16:21:24:28, for example,<br/>as found in the 1-3-7-9 hexany.</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-lattice1.jpg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-lattice1.jpg</a>&gt;</p><p>Now with 441/352, and fifths that are wide by 1.756 cents on the<br/>average (or consistently in the 2048-EDO version), we&apos;re going to<br/>be very close to 10/9 and 5/3, as appears in that JI transversal<br/>from C. But it carries the possible inference of a just 5/4 which<br/>simply doesn&apos;t hold because the fifths are actually tempered!<br/>When the impurity is around 441/440 or greater, this becomes in<br/>my view a nontrivial point in distinguishing parapyth from pele.</p><p>Note that the JI sequence 39:42:49:52 has 49/39 (395.169 cents)<br/>reduced to 441/352 -- as we might expect in a system which, by<br/>definition for parapyth and more broadly the gentle family,<br/>tempers out the 352/351. This is different from pele, which seeks<br/>a more accurate 5/4 than 441/352.</p><p>MET-24 may be a just about perfect optimization not only for my<br/>intended 1/1-9/8-99/80-4/3 (9/8-11/10-320:297) or whatever, but<br/>also for Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic 12:11:10:9, in a mode of two<br/>disjunct tetrachords 1/1-12/11-6/5-4/3-3/2-18/11-9/5-2/1.</p><p>Note that there is no 5/4 interval above the 1/1, while 12/11 and<br/>18/11 are virtually just.

It should be at least mutually amusing, and perhaps<br/>mutually edifying.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at your numbers above as one way to understand why I find<br/>it very curious that MET-24 would be described as an instance of pele,<br/>although I would agree that someone looking for a pele pathway will<br/>find it. The simple fact, as I see it, is that MET-24 uses a way<br/>larger linear generator or 703.711 cents, way beyond POTE pele and<br/>somewhat beyond George Secor&apos;s HTT at 703.579 cents.</p><p>One indication of this is that in 1978, George _didn&apos;t_ rely on pele<br/>to get 5/4: instead, he used an ingenious irregular 29-note structure<br/>to make 5/4 just! That to me is the dog that didn&apos;t bark, alerting<br/>us that 703.711 cents in MET-24 is simply too high for this purpose<br/>when George, about the most ingenious designer out there, evidently<br/>found 703.579 cents a bit high for a pele path to 5/4.</p><p>A simple sense of scale and place will show that MET-24 is much closer<br/>to POTE parapyth than to POTE pele:</p><p>   POTE                   Secor&apos;s                          POTE<br/>   pele                     HTT           MET-24         parapyth<br/>    |------------------------|---------------|--------------|<br/> 703.414                  703.579         703.711        703.856</p><p>Commas or dieses provide another view of this. At the POTE pele tuning<br/>we have a near-eigenmonzo of 23/19 for the augmented second or<br/>supraminor third. Now from 23/19 to 5/4 is 95/92 or 55.552 cents, as<br/>compared to the 91/88 or 58.036 cents -- a comma of 2093/2090, or<br/>2.483 cents. That isn&apos;t so hard to finesse so that 5/4 and 7/4 are<br/>both at or very close to just, as happens in POTE pele.</p><p>But even at Secor&apos;s HTT generator, 703.579 cents, we essentially have<br/>91/88 as the spacing for 7/4, but the considerably smaller 65/63 (from<br/>the eigenmonzo of 63/52 to 5/4) for 5/4. That&apos;s a full 441/440 comma.</p><p>Now let&apos;s quickly recap what happens in MET-24 at 703.711. Here 22/13<br/>is in 2048-EDO a bit larger than just, so the spacing for a pure 7/4<br/>is actually a bit less than 91/88: 57.693 cents. But the ideal spacing<br/>for 5/4 has shrunk to 52.916 cents. Now the 7/4 spacing is a bit<br/>narrow of 91/88, and the 5/4 spacing almost equally narrow of 33/32,<br/>so the comma has effectively grown to about 364/363.</p><p>In my view, that&apos;s simply not a good optimization strategy for someone<br/>following the pele agenda and seeking 5/4. We seem to agree that pele<br/>optimizes below HTT, and MET-24 deliberately goes a bit above it.</p><p>Now, as I see it, it&apos;s impossible to optimize for 2.3.7.11.13 in this<br/>general region and resolve to make the fifths a bit closer to pure<br/>than in 12n-ED2, as in MET-24, and not get a pele pathway. It<br/>happens in POTE Parapyth, also: carry this to 34 notes (2x17-MOS), and<br/>we get 12 thirds closer to pure than in 1/6-comma meantone. Maybe<br/>we might seek out fine points of the exact name for the pathway at<br/>different temperings, or the precise commas involved, but in practice<br/>we have quite recognizable approximations of 5/4 all around the parapyth<br/>region (around 703.447-704.2 cents). And likewise for ChristmasEve<br/>(704.2-704.5 cents), known from a 13-limit perspective as leapday.</p><p>In fact, POTE Parapyth in 24 notes (393.043 cents), to take the set<br/>analogous to MET-24, isn&apos;t that far from a pure 14/11 tuning at<br/>704.377 cents in the size of its closest 5/4 approximation, there<br/>391.917 cents. It&apos;s like different shades of meantone. And if we<br/>carry POTE Parapyth to 58 notes (2x29-MOS), we get 380.976 cents<br/>(a bit closer than 1/3-comma meantone or 19-EDO) via the leapday<br/>route (21 fifths up, or thrice the apotome, on a single chain).</p><p>In deciding whether something is actually an intentional example of<br/>pele or leapday, for example, or rather a pele-compatible or<br/>leapday-compatible temperament, here are three questions which I find<br/>helpful:</p><p>       (1) Is the tuning size large enough supply a reasonable number<br/>           of 5-limit thirds?

The result is that 2.3.11/10.7.11.13 and 2.3.5.7.11.13 mean exactly the same thing.</p><p>Yes, as soon as I read Margo&apos;s comment I had an urge to say exactly this. In the lexicon of regular temperament theory, &quot;2.3.11/10.7.11.13&quot; means an infinite set of JI intervals, consisting of all possible *combinations* of those listed. Therefore &quot;2.3.11/10.7.11.13&quot; contains 5/4 in it, because 5/4 = (2)^(-3) * (11/10)^(-1) * (11)^(1). Similarly, 2.3.5.7.11.13 contains 11/10 already, so the two subgroups are one and the same.</p><p>&gt; In Graham&apos;s temperament finder they don&apos;t, but someone else will have to unravel the mysteries of what, exactly, it does and why.</p><p>I believe I understand what exactly it&apos;s doing. The only reason why the results are different for the two different bases is that, for optimization purposes, Graham&apos;s finder always uses the L2 norm of the weighted error vector components *in the given basis*. So, even though the two bases are different expressions of the same vector space, the *norm* Graham&apos;s finder uses on this vector space depends on the basis.</p><p>Let me give numerical examples of this to avoid any confusion:</p><p>If you put in Pele in the standard 2.3.5.7.11.13 basis ( <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46p+17c+41p&limit=2.3.5.7.11.13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46p+17c+41p&limit=2.3.5.7.11.13</a> ) you get this as the TE tuning map:</p><p>&lt;1199.498, 1902.618, 2787.030, 3366.302, 4152.316, 4441.951]</p><p>so the weighted error vector is</p><p>[-0.000418, 0.000349, 0.000257, -0.000749, 0.000240, 0.000321]</p><p>and the L2 norm of that is 0.00104. (Note that Graham&apos;s finder gives it in cents per octave, and it&apos;s also root *mean* square instead of root *sum* square, so that&apos;s an overall factor of 1200/sqrt(6) in this case.)</p><p>If you took that same tuning map but expressed it in the 2.3.11/10.7.11.13 basis, you would get</p><p>Tuning map: &lt;1199.498, 1902.618, 165.788, 3366.302, 4152.316, 4441.951]<br/>Weighted error: [-0.000418, 0.000349, 0.004750, -0.000749, 0.000240, 0.000321]<br/>L2 norm: 0.00486</p><p>Note that the component corresponding to 11/10 is much larger than the others, so it dominates the L2 norm. In other words, because 11/10 was given in the basis, the algorithm isn&apos;t treating it as a complex interval, but as a &quot;prime&quot; interval that&apos;s much smaller than 2, and hence more important to optimize.</p><p>So, if you put in Pele in the 2.3.11/10.7.11.13 basis ( <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46p+17p+41p&limit=2.3.11/10.7.11.13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=46p+17p+41p&limit=2.3.11/10.7.11.13</a> ), you don&apos;t get the above tuning map, but instead this other one:</p><p>Tuning map: &lt;1199.434, 1902.594, 165.002, 3367.030, 4152.691, 4442.078]<br/>Weighted error: [-0.000472, 0.000336, -0.000014, -0.000533, 0.000331, 0.000349]<br/>L2 norm: 0.000923</p><p>Note that in this tuning map, 11/10 is tuned much more accurately, which decreases the L2 norm in this other basis because it&apos;s much more sensitive to the mistuning of 11/10.</p><p>AFAIK, this kind of norm doesn&apos;t have much theoretical justification at all unless it coincides with the T2 norm, which only happens when every element in the basis is a prime power. Note that some subgroups, for example 2.5/3.7/3, cannot be expressed in this way; it would be nice to have something that optimized these using the actual T2 norm rather than some arbitrary L2 norm related to a particular basis.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=105213 href="#105213">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2012 2:43:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; AFAIK, this kind of norm doesn&apos;t have much theoretical justification at all unless it coincides with the T2 norm, which only happens when every element in the basis is a prime power.</p><p>Sorry, this isn&apos;t quite right.

And one<br/>of the things we may learn is that our viewpoints may differ a<br/>bit in how we &quot;lump and split&quot; different kinds of tunings, seeing<br/>them as shadings of the same category, or representatives of<br/>different categories.</p><p>The &quot;lumping and splitting&quot; thing may come from linguistics. Some linguistics like to &quot;split,&quot; looking for lots of different<br/>language families; other like to &quot;lump,&quot; proposing various groups<br/>or supergroups that go so deep (e.g. Nostratic) that it&apos;s hard to<br/>verify or falsify them using standard comparative methods.</p><p>Here, we&apos;ve identified an interesting difference in how we lump<br/>or split tunings with our respective paradigms.</p><p>Clearly you see POTE Parapyth at (2/1, 703.856, 58.339) as in a<br/>different category than the 13/9, 7/6 eigenmonzo tuning at what I<br/>believe from the linear generator and eigenmonzos must be a<br/>tuning of (2/1, 703.782, 59.308). This is a temperament of the<br/>fifth by precisely (28672/28431)^(1/8), or 1/8-Secorian comma,<br/>resulting in a just 26/21 or 21/13, the difference between the<br/>other eigenmonzos of 7/6 and 13/9.</p><p>More specifically, if I understand correctly, you see MET-24 as<br/>falling more within Pele because it is closer to your 13/9, 7/6<br/>tuning than to POTE Parapyth.</p><p>This is a point I would like to understand more clearly, but<br/>already know must have something to do with the commas tempered<br/>out in each of these tunings. The best thing I can do is to<br/>invite you to explain how RMP distinguishes between these<br/>tunings, and then carefully read your reply and ask any questions<br/>I might have.</p><p>               *              *            *</p><p>At the same time, in my next message, I&apos;ll explain why I see<br/>MET-24 and O3 (the latter with a generator very close to POTE<br/>Parapyth) as slightly different shadings of the same basic<br/>scheme. An important point I&apos;ll develop is that I see both, as<br/>well as POTE Parapyth itself, as having 11:10 as a factor,<br/>whether intentionally (as for with O3 and MET-24 alike) or<br/>otherwise, as with POTE Parapyth if it is purely 2.3.7.11.13.</p><p>I&apos;ll explain that an important part in my optimizations of O3 and<br/>more recently MET-24 is what I might term ZEO, or Zalzalian<br/>Epimore Optimization: getting 14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and in these<br/>tunings also 11:10 as close to just as possible, within the<br/>overall structure and other constraints of the tuning scheme.<br/>Your tuning with eigenmonzos of 7/6, 13/9, and 26/21 also<br/>provides an interesting example of how, with the same generator<br/>of 703.782 cents, somewhere between MET-24 and POTE Parapyth or<br/>O3, I might usually optimize a bit differently, aiming for a just<br/>13/12 and 7/4 rather than 7/6 and 13/9.</p><p>Whereas POTE gives more weight to simpler primes, if I understand<br/>correctly from Mike, ZEO gives lots of weight to ratios like<br/>13:12 and 12:11 -- and, often, about equal weight to 7/6 and<br/>13/8, for example. As I&apos;ll explain, this means around the region<br/>we&apos;re exploring, say 703.6-703.9 cents, using ZEO will promote a<br/>slightly smaller spacing generator than POTE.</p><p>This is a difference you noted between MET-24 (2/1, 703.711,<br/>57.422) and POTE Parapyth (2/1, 703.856, 58.339). What I owe you<br/>is a coherent account of how and why I would set the spacing at<br/>57.422 cents, which happens to be 49 tuning units of 1024-EDO.<br/>And that will be a theme of my next post explaining ZEO.</p><p>&gt;&gt; One indication of this is that in 1978, George _didn&apos;t_ rely on pele<br/>&gt;&gt; to get 5/4: instead, he used an ingenious irregular 29-note structure<br/>&gt;&gt; to make 5/4 just!</p><p>&gt;  Was that irregular structure basically a modification of pele,<br/>&gt;  however? I presume you mean the scale secor29htt.scl; I think<br/>&gt;  it might be worthwhile to analyze that in terms of closeness<br/>&gt;  to a regular temperament.</p><p>A good question, and worth pursuing as I shall in a moment. But<br/>first, I should apologize for maybe being too defensive about my<br/>own tuning when simply explaining what I was doing when I<br/>designed MET-24 in 2011, or O3 in 2010, might be more helpful in<br/>giving you insight into my optimization concepts than looking at<br/>what George Secor was doing in 1978. The latter question,<br/>however, is highly interesting in itself!</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely right: let&apos;s see what happens to 5/4 in the<br/>regular temperament. We know that 63/52 is just, and that the<br/>spacing for George&apos;s just 7/4 is 58.090 cents, a tiny amount<br/>greater than 91/88 (0.054 cents). So in a regular rank-3 scheme,<br/>we have a third of 390.298 cents, the same tiny amount greater<br/>than 441/352. The impurity of 5/4 is 3.930 cents.</p><p>And in my more mathematically semiliterate approach, if we may<br/>call it that, I would simply say to myself, &quot;Well, 5/4 is about<br/>1/6 Pythagorean comma wide (3.910 cents), and a bit less than the<br/>1/5 syntonic comma (4.301 cents) we&apos;d get in 1/5-comma meantone.<br/>So there&apos;s little question that 5 is present here, however<br/>intentionally or otherwise.&quot;</p><p>So to me, it&apos;s not quantum leaps from one comma to another which<br/>make one tuning 2.3.7.11.13 and another 13-limit Pele in this<br/>region, but the pervasive reality that we&apos;re going to get rather<br/>nice meantone-quality thirds wherever we go in Parapyth, through<br/>what RMP terms either the Pele and/or the Leapday pathway -- but<br/>maybe those are wrong as the general terms I want. What I want to<br/>say is &quot;either the pathway of 9-generators-plus-spacing in<br/>rank-3, or 21-generators-up in rank-2.&quot;</p><p>The one landmark that stands out to me is the point where, if we<br/>space for a just 7/4, for example (as I routinely do around<br/>703.7-703.9 cents), these pathways are equally accurate at<br/>approximating 5/4. We would really a 58-note system to take full<br/>advantage of each pathway (2x29-MOS), but the relevant tuning<br/>would be (2/1, 703.8445, 57.292). At this point, either pathway<br/>yields a 5/4 impure by 5.579 cents -- somewhere, in my analysis,<br/>between 1/4 syntonic and 1/4 Pythagorean comma.

You&apos;re probably the<br/>one -- maybe together with him -- to look at secor29htt.scl and<br/>appreciate all the subtleties and commas.</p><p>But my understanding is that balancing out the circle of 29<br/>fifths, where one is about 715.477 cents (the same kind thing we<br/>find in a regular rank-3 Parapyth for 2x12-MOS where the top of<br/>the lower chain connects with the bottom of the upper chain),<br/>calls for some meantone-like fifths, one or more of which<br/>corrects for the 441/440 and results in seven pure 5/4 thirds.</p><p>However, from my point of view, the brute reality is that any<br/>Parapyth scheme will tend to have 5-limit approximations lurking<br/>about: even Peppermint-24, at (2/1, 704.096, 58.680), has what I<br/>would call a &quot;9-generators-up-plus-spacing&quot; third at 395.540<br/>cents -- as it happens, just about identical to 1/7-comma<br/>meantone (395.531 cents)! Now we can call this a near-just 49/39,<br/>and indeed it is, since 14/13 is virtually just and 7/6 an<br/>eigenmonzo -- but lots of people lots of the time would call it a<br/>recognizable approximation of 5/4. And if we expand to<br/>Peppermint-58 with a 29-MOS, then Leapday is very close to a 5/4<br/>eigenmonzo!</p><p>From my viewpoint, these approximations of 5 simply come with the<br/>territory: and my stance is neither to disown them nor to make<br/>them a part of my optimization process itself, which focuses on<br/>2.3.7.11.13 and ZEO. The unintended remote intervals we get in<br/>our tunings are special gifts and surprises.</p><p>Also, I tend to decide whether a given ratio or interval is<br/>represented in a tuning by intuitive methods not much depending<br/>on commas, although I admire the sophistication of RMP and find<br/>that a commatic analysis is fascinating in revealing more of the<br/>fine structure.</p><p>For example, I would say that POTE Parapyth does represent 11/10,<br/>which at 161.440 cents is about 3.564 cents narrow. The 9/8 is<br/>wide by 3.802 cents, so 11/10 is actually better!</p><p>And your 5/4 approximation is 393.043 cents, 6.729 cents wide, or<br/>a bit less than 1/3 syntonic comma -- in other words, a tad<br/>better than 1/6-comma meantone. So if 5 is present in MET-24,<br/>which it is as a musical option (however sparse), I&apos;d say that<br/>it&apos;s present in POTE Parapyth: we are simply looking further into<br/>the exact shadings, and the commas to which they may relate.</p><p>That commatic analysis might yield lots of musical insights, but<br/>is unlikely to change the simple reality, as I see it, that all<br/>of Parapyth has meantone-quality approximations of 5 through what<br/>I will call the pathway of &quot;9-generators-up-plus-spacing.&quot;</p><p>Note that I&apos;m resisting the temptation to say &quot;Pele&quot; as a<br/>nickname for this pathway, since that name would imply some<br/>specific comma or commas. To me, it&apos;s a simple reality on<br/>keyboard, in MET-24, O3, or Peppermint: take an augmented second<br/>like F-G# at around 63/52, for example, and add that spacing,<br/>thus F-G#* in my typical notation, and we get something a bit<br/>wide of 5/4. Whether it&apos;s around 390 or 392 or 395 cents is just<br/>a matter of shading: to me, the phenomenon is basically the<br/>same.</p><p>It&apos;s not a part of the design, but a predictable result of it.<br/>So here I do a bit of &quot;lumping,&quot; and don&apos;t usually think in terms<br/>of specific commas: &quot;An augmented second or supraminor third plus<br/>spacing gives a meantone-like shading of 5/4.&quot;</p><p>So in my understanding, Parapyth is a 2.3.7.11.13 system where<br/>we&apos;re going to get some ratios of 5 in any 2x12-MOS system via<br/>the 9-generators-up-plus-spacing pathway. Someone could use that<br/>pathway now and then as a variation on the main 2.3.7.11.13<br/>theme, my approach; or seek to make it an integral part of the<br/>design and maybe expand to 2x17-MOS or indeed 2x29-MOS, etc.</p><p>Taking what to me seems a purely descriptive perspective, quite<br/>apart from the intent of any tuning designer, in describing a<br/>given Parapyth tuning we can simply note any pathways to 5 that<br/>might be available in a given tuning size, e.g. 24-note rank-3<br/>(2x12-MOS) or 29-note rank-2, etc. It&apos;s like a strait in<br/>geography: you might or might not choose to sail there, but it&apos;s<br/>there if and when you want to use it.</p><p>Obviously George Secor was very specifically out to optimize 5,<br/>and he used an irregular tuning for that specific purpose. It<br/>would be very valuable to understand the exact commas involved,<br/>and on that question my main role might be to listen to you and<br/>George unfolding the fine points, and possibly offer an odd<br/>comment now and get about the kinds of commas like 28672/28431<br/>that seem to attract my special affection.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105218 href="#105218">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2012 5:38:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Clearly you see POTE Parapyth at (2/1, 703.856, 58.339) as in a<br/>&gt; different category than the 13/9, 7/6 eigenmonzo tuning at what I<br/>&gt; believe from the linear generator and eigenmonzos must be a<br/>&gt; tuning of (2/1, 703.782, 59.308).</p><p>Actually, I don&apos;t.

This is an<br/>interesting example where the structure of 1024-EDO itself<br/>pointed to the choice of generator (actually the average of two<br/>generators in the real-world tuning), but there&apos;s a theoretical<br/>way of reaching an almost identical result not tied to any<br/>specific EDO. We might speak of these as the &quot;bitmap&quot; and<br/>&quot;vectorized&quot; versions, if an analogy from computer graphics might<br/>be helpful.</p><p>I&apos;ve decided to reserve the question of an alternative<br/>optimization with the generator of the 7/6-13/9-26/21 eigenmonzo<br/>tuning you called to my attention (2/1, 703.782, 59.308) for<br/>another post, because this question deserves more consideration<br/>on my part. Thus this post will stick with O3 and MET-24.</p><p>What I should emphasize at the outset, before explaining the<br/>optimization of these tunings, is one point about O3 as well as<br/>the later MET-24.</p><p>Both tunings are very specifically designed to optimize the 11/10<br/>neutral second, as well as 12/11, 13/12, and 14/13. That was a<br/>major focus of O3 as well as MET-24, as I made clear in my<br/>announcement of O3:</p><p>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_91499.html#91499">/tuning/topicId_91499.html#91499</a>&gt;</p><p>In that announcement, I noted a specific desire for a system<br/>&quot;optimizing the large Zalzalian or neutral third at 26/21 (370<br/>cents)&quot; for an historical flavor of Ottoman Rast. &quot;More<br/>generally,&quot; I continued, &quot;it was my goal to optimize all four of<br/>the [superparticular] Zalzalian or middle second steps discussed<br/>by medieval Islamic theorists such as Safi al-Din, and also Ozan,<br/>the 14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and 11:10.&quot;</p><p>One interesting cultural point here is that 26/21 is a basic<br/>interval for me, and might go far to define a tuning system, once<br/>I make clear my implicit assumption that this interval will be<br/>the diminished fourth from 8 generators up.</p><p>At the same time, I was drawn to idea of a just 22/21 limma,<br/>another ratio I really like. And, of course, 14/13 and 13/11<br/>would be important, as well as 7/6, 7/4, 9/7, and 21/16, etc.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Optimizing O3 in 1024-EDO: Some help from the limma for 11/10 ----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For O3 in 1024-EDO, my goal within a single 12-MOS chain was to<br/>get 26/21 close to just and at the same time have 11/10 with<br/>roughly Secor&apos;s HTT tolerance of just, 3.247 cents, which since<br/>2001, when he shared that tuning with me, has become a kind of<br/>emblem of &quot;near-just&quot; quality.</p><p>This brings me to what may be a basic difference between the POTE<br/>worldview and my optimization strategy.</p><p>The POTE, I assume, looks at all relevant primes at the same<br/>time, and gives them weights by which to arrive, say, at a rank-3<br/>Parapyth system with the parameters simultaneously determined.</p><p>In my approach, it&apos;s more of a layered process: first optimizing<br/>a 12-MOS or its slightly irregular equivalent in 1024-EDO; and<br/>then deciding on the spacing which will complete a rank-3,<br/>24-note tuning.</p><p>My approach is somewhat analogous to the layered or successive<br/>composition of 13th-14th century European polyphony, where often<br/>one voice is added at a time. Indeed, one might often start with<br/>an existing melody, and add one or more new melodic lines to it.<br/>This is what happened in Peppermint-24: Keenan Pepper had already<br/>defined the 12-MOS, and I simply picked the distance at which to<br/>set the second identical chain (58.680 cents) for a pure 7/6.<br/>There neither the 12-MOS of Keenan Pepper nor the spacing was<br/>conceived in 1024-EDO, but O3 was designed from the ground up<br/>specifically for 1024-EDO.</p><p>This means that for O3, I first designed and optimized the basic<br/>rank-2 12-MOS, and then decided on the spacing. Both stages of<br/>the process were based in 1024-EDO, as I&apos;ll describe.</p><p>Here I realized that a just 22/21 and 26/21 were highly<br/>compatible ideas; if asked to explain, I might note that the<br/>difference between these intervals is 13/11, which in O3 is<br/>always within a cent of just.</p><p>Another element of the 12-MOS equation for O3, and also for<br/>MET-24 as we&apos;ll see, is the subtle balance between 14/13 and<br/>11/10, the two epimoric neutral seconds represented within a<br/>single chain of generators. I knew that 14/13 would be a bit<br/>narrow at a just 22/21 tuning, but still well within the HTT<br/>tolerance: 11/10 was more the issue.</p><p>Of course, I knew that the theoretical generator was<br/>(84/11)^(1/5) or 3/2 tempered wide by (896/891)^(1/5), at 703.893<br/>cents. Rather humorously, this is 1.938 cents wide, or almost<br/>precisely as impure as in 12n-EDO (1.955 cents), but in the<br/>opposite direction!</p><p>In practice, however, I was designing and tuning in 1024-EDO,<br/>where there is no fifth of this size, but available nearby sizes<br/>of 600 or 601 steps: 703.125 or 704.297 cents. My purpose was<br/>develop a bearing plan so that, if possible, all limmas or<br/>diatonic semitones from 5 fifths down would be at the best<br/>possible approximation of 22/21.</p><p>This approximation was 69 steps, or 80.859 cents -- wide of 22/21<br/>by 0.322 cents. The reason for this slight difference from just<br/>(80.537 cents) is that while 599 steps is almost exactly 3/2, the<br/>representation of 896/891 at 8 steps (9.375 cents) falls slightly<br/>short of the just size at 9.688 cents.</p><p>My strategy was to lay out a digital &quot;bearing plan&quot; so that each<br/>five generators in a chain would be wide by 8 tuning steps in all<br/>for the best 22/21. I&apos;ll first give the scheme, and then consider<br/>the consequences for 11/10.</p><p>   704.3  703.1 704.3 703.1 704.3 704.3 703.1 704.3 703.1 704.3 704.3<br/> Eb     Bb     F     C     G     D     A     E     B    F#    C#    G#<br/>    601    600  601    600   601   601   600   601  600   601   601<br/>    +2     +1    +2    +1    +2    +2    +1    +2    +1   +2    +2</p><p>One compromise of this scheme, by the way, is that although the<br/>average temperament might be a bit less in than 12n-EDO, 7 or our<br/>11 fifths in a chain are a bit more impure than in 12n-EDO. But<br/>that&apos;s an aside: let&apos;s get back to 11/10.</p><p>Because of the slight inaccuracy of 1024-EDO in the wide direction<br/>for 22/21, and our consistent use of this closest approximation<br/>at 69 tuning steps or 80.859 cents, it follows that 11/10 from<br/>two such limmas, or a chain of ten fifths down, will be a bit<br/>larger than (22/21)^2 or 484/441 at 161.074 cents -- i.e. 138<br/>tuning steps or 161.719 cents, about 3.285 cents narrow of 11/10.<br/>This is very close to the emblematic HTT standard of 3.247<br/>cents, and so I deemed it a happy optimization.</p><p>Another feature of this optimization is that 13/11 is always<br/>within a cent of just (289.210 cents), at either 4 or 5 tuning<br/>steps narrow of the near-just 1024-EDO version of 32/27 at 251<br/>tuning steps: 288.281 cents or 289.453 cents.</p><p>How about our 26/21 with a just size of 369.747 cents (thinking<br/>of airlines helps to remember the decimal value!)? We get it at<br/>369.141 or 370.312 cents, again always within a cent of just.</p><p>There is a humorous touch here, as I realized: in a certain<br/>Pickwickian way, O3 might be said to observe the 2080/2079<br/>distinguishing 99/80 or 9/8 plus 11/10 (368.914 cents), an<br/>interval occurring in al-Farabi&apos;s 9:8-11:10-320:297, from 26/21 in<br/>a permutation of Ibn Sina&apos;s 9:8-14:13-208:189, for example, as<br/>well as his exquisite 8:7-13:12-14:13.</p><p>It is possible to view the smaller tempering of the submajor or<br/>large neutral second at 369.141 cents as representing 99/80<br/>(0.226 cents wide), and the larger at 370.312 cents as<br/>representing 26/21. This kind of thing is a big part of my<br/>culture of optimization, which should be fun!</p><p>The 14/11 major third is at 414.844 or 416.016 cents, the first<br/>value actually leaning a bit toward 33/26 (412.745 cents), and<br/>the second more strongly toward 14/11 (417.508 cents). These<br/>results are fine, and subtly distinct from those of Peppermint<br/>based on Keenan Pepper&apos;s Noble Fifth tuning (2/1, 704.096), where<br/>in 1024-EDO, 14/11 is at 416.016 cents (as sometimes here) or the<br/>virtually just 417.187 cents.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Optimizing O3 in 1024-EDO: Setting the spacing and ZEO<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the process of successive or layered optimization, we proceed<br/>from the now-defined 12-note chain to the final parameter<br/>defining O3 as a rank-3 tuning: the size of the spacing generator<br/>between our established chain and the duplicate we are about to<br/>add. In other words, what distance shall we place between the<br/>chains.</p><p>Here two approaches happily coincide: eigenmonzos or ZEO<br/>(Zalzalian Epimore Optimization). Note that 2010 was not yet<br/>familiar with the meaning of the term eigenmonzo, although I seem<br/>to recall hearing it various times on the tuning lists. However,<br/>since &quot;going for a just interval&quot; is pretty much synonymous, I&apos;ll<br/>use the RMP term, which I find very comfortable.</p><p>Apart from 22/21 and 26/21 -- and thus 13/11 -- my intended<br/>eigenmonzos were 7/4, and also 11/6 (7/4 plus 22/21). Here<br/>1024-EDO introduces a charming ambiguity and leeway: the &quot;within<br/>a cent or tuning unit&quot; test for &quot;virtual justness.&quot;</p><p>One form of virtual justness we have seen within a single chain,<br/>specifically with 22/21, is always using the nearest<br/>approximation (here 80.859 cents). A different form, which we<br/>have seen with 13/11 and 26/21, where there are two tempered<br/>sizes because of the inevitably irregular chain of fifths in a<br/>1024-EDO &quot;bitmap&quot; or &quot;halftoning pattern&quot; to get the desired<br/>shading of temperament, is having each of these sizes no further<br/>than a 1024-EDO tuning unit (1.171875 cents) from just.</p><p>In other words, where there are two sizes, they should be the two<br/>sizes with the just value in the middle: the two best 1024-EDO<br/>approximations.</p><p>Accordingly, I optimized 7/4 knowing that the two best 1024-EDO<br/>temperaments are 826 units at 967.969 cents (0.857 cents narrow),<br/>and 827 units at 969.141 cents (0.315 cents wide).</p><p>Now in the 12-note O3 chain already defined, we have a major<br/>sixth always within a cent of just of 22/13, at 777 units<br/>(910.547 cents) or 778 units (911.719 cents). So a spacing of 49<br/>units will make our 7/4 always 826 or 827 units, the two sizes<br/>that bracket the just value of 968.826 cents.</p><p>How does our other eigenmonzo, 11/6, fare under this arrangement?<br/>It&apos;s just value is 1049.363 cents, with the nearest 1024-EDO<br/>values at either 895 units (1048.828 cents), 0.535 cents narrow;<br/>or 896 units (1050.000 cents), 0.637 cents wide.</p><p>While we could calculate the spacing in terms of the regular<br/>minor seventh at 846 or 847 units (991.406 or 992.578 cents,<br/>knowing that the 22/21 limma or diatonic semitone is always at<br/>its best approximation of 69 steps gives a shortcut: adding this<br/>size of 69 steps to our 7/4 at 826 or 827 steps gives us our<br/>desired 11/6 at 895 or 896 cents!</p><p>Our virtual eigenmonzos are thus in place. Now we come to a step<br/>which has really already been resolved: ZEO, or checking the<br/>accuracy of our four Zalzalian epimore steps, &quot;Zalzalian&quot; meaning<br/>neutral steps or intervals, and referring to Mansur Zalzal, a<br/>player of the &grave;oud or lute in 8th-century Baghdad who is credited<br/>with introducing the neutral third fret on this instrument.</p><p>Our 12-note chain has already determined the values for 14/13<br/>(just size 128.298 cents) at 126.563 or 127.734 cents, always<br/>within 1.736 cents or just; and 11/10, at a less ideal but<br/>reasonably close representation of 161.719 cents or 3.285 cents<br/>narrow. If both 11/10 and 14/13 were just, we would have a minor<br/>third at 77/65 (293.302 cents), narrow of 32/27 by 2080/2079 or<br/>0.833 cents. Each is a bit narrow, however, with the actual third<br/>a near-just 13/11, or about a 352/351 (4.925 cents) smaller than<br/>32/27 -- thus tempering out the difference between 352/351 or<br/>2080/2079, or 847/845 (4.093 cents).</p><p>Having accounted for 14/13 and 11/10, the small and large neutral<br/>steps, we have remaining the smaller and larger central steps at<br/>13/12 and 12/11. The latter is always accounted for as the octave<br/>inversion of our 11/6 eigenmonzo. Since 13/11 is also a &quot;1024-EDO<br/>eigenmonzo&quot; always within a cent of just, it follows that 13/12<br/>is likely near-just also. And so it is.</p><p>We know that a limma is always 69 units or 80.859 cents, and that<br/>our optimal spacing for our other eigenmonzos such as 7/4 is<br/>evidently 49 units or 57.422 cents. Adding these two intervals,<br/>we find that a limma plus spacing will always be equal to 118<br/>units or 138.281 cents -- a virtually just 13/12 at 138.573<br/>cents!</p><p>So we have our temperament!</p><p>Here&apos;s a piece in it:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>3. Jacques Dudon&apos;s influence: From O3 to MET-24<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>In the summer of 2011, Jacques Dudon and I had some discussions<br/>in this group and elsewhere on his Tsaharuk system, in which he<br/>stressed the importance of pure fifths and fourths as an ideal in<br/>maqam. This led to a question: could I perhaps keep the<br/>attractive features of O3 while reducing the temperament of the<br/>fifths a bit? The just qanun tunings of Julien Jalaleddine Weiss<br/>also served as an ideal which I might strive to approach a bit<br/>more closely.</p><p>A related criterion was the wisdom of George Secor -- or my<br/>sometimes curious version of it -- that a truly &quot;near-just&quot;<br/>temperament ought to do significantly better with 3/2 and 4/3<br/>than 12n-EDO. Peppermint, while a wonderful system, clearly<br/>tempered the fifths and fourths at 2.141 cents, a bit _more_ than<br/>12n-EDO, while O3 was in theory just about on par with 12n-EDO.</p><p>Of course, 29-HTT was my perennial inspiration, if &quot;perennial&quot;<br/>means &quot;since I learned about it from him in 2001.&quot; The thing was<br/>that I wanted 14/13 and 14/11 just a bit closer to just than in<br/>that classic system, but while still keeping some of the<br/>&quot;near-just&quot; quality. Whatever I did, I would be standing on the<br/>shoulders of a giant; but maybe I could add a small touch to make<br/>the world of tunings yet more diverse.</p><p>Once I focused on the problem, 1024-EDO itself had an obvious<br/>solution. As I&apos;ve mentioned, there are two sizes of fifths<br/>relevant for these temperaments of a kind we now call Parapyth:<br/>a smaller fifth at 600 units or 703.125 cents, and a larger one<br/>at 704.297 cents. We use a &quot;bitmap&quot; or &quot;halftoning pattern&quot; of<br/>these two fifths to get a &quot;shade of gray&quot; somewhere in between.</p><p>The simplest such pattern would simply alternating a smaller<br/>fifth with a larger one, and so filling out each 11-fifth chain!<br/>The theoretical generator would thus be the average of the two<br/>sizes, 703.711 cents, with maximal evenness: the whole-tone at<br/>207.422 cents, and all intervals from even numbers of generators,<br/>would have a single size, and likewise all intervals derived from<br/>these plus or minus the spacing.</p><p>A simple and delightful bearing plan indeed:</p><p>   703.1  704.3 703.1 704.3 703.1 704.3 703.1 704.3 703,1 704.3 703.1<br/> Eb     Bb     F     C     G     D     A     E     B    F#    C#    G#<br/>    600    601   600   601   600   601   600   601  600   601   600<br/>    +1     +2    +1    +2    +1    +2    +1    +2    +1   +2    +1</p><p>In some ways it brought to mind certain unequal temperaments of<br/>Neidhardt in the 18th century alternating fifths tuned pure or<br/>1/6-Pythagorean comma narrow to emulate a 1/12-Pythagorean comma<br/>temperament, as in 12-EDO.</p><p>A big advantage was that a majority of fifths -- six out of 11,<br/>are at 703.125 cents (1.170 cents wide), and thus substantially<br/>closer to pure than 12n-EDO; while the others are not too much<br/>more impure at 704.297 cents or 2.342 cents, by comparison with<br/>1.955 cents. So I could call this &quot;really near-just&quot; in at least<br/>a quasi-Secorian sense -- not necessarily to speak for George,<br/>and while noting that it remains less &quot;near-just&quot; than 29-HTT at<br/>703.579 cents!</p><p>The name I chose for the new tuning was Milder Extended<br/>Temperament, or MET-24 -- milder, that is, than Peppermint or<br/>even O3, with the fifths tempered in the wide or &quot;extended&quot;<br/>direction (an idiom I learned from Jacques Dudon).</p><p>Since this is a rather small tweak of O3, lots of the features<br/>remain the same. For example, 13/11 has the same sizes of around<br/>288.3 or 289.5 cents, both within a cent of just. The spacing is<br/>the same, 49 units or 57.422 cents. Let&apos;s consider a few subtle<br/>changes.</p><p>First, from a ZEO perspective, this is the one 1024-EDO<br/>Parapyth temperament of which I am aware (to use our new term)<br/>where 14/13, 13/12, 12/11, and 11/10 are all consistently within<br/>three cents of just.</p><p>This involves a compromise in which 11/10 is always formed from a<br/>limma of 80.859 cents (the O3 value) or 82.031 cents, resulting<br/>in a size of 162.891 cents, or 2.114 cents narrow -- well within<br/>that HTT standard of 3.247 cents!</p><p>The real compromise, although not too severe is with 14/13, now a<br/>bit smaller at 125.391 cents (2.908 cents narrow) or the size of<br/>126.563 cents also found in O3 (1.736 cents narrow). So, on the<br/>average, 14/13 is roughly as far from just as 11/10, a judicious<br/>balance.</p><p>With 13/12 and 12/11, the changes from O3 are very subtle. While<br/>13/12 was in O3 a virtual eigenmonzo with the single tempered size<br/>closest to just (138.281 cents), here it fluctuates between this<br/>size of 118 steps and the next larger at 119 steps of 139.453<br/>cents -- 0.880 cents wide.</p><p>Likewise, 12/11 is very slightly less optimal, having a single<br/>size of 150.000 cents, or 0.637 cents narrow -- rather than<br/>varying between this size and the slightly more accurate value of<br/>151.172 cents (0.535 cents wide). Since it is still always within<br/>a tuning unit of just, it is still deemed a virtual eigenmonzo.</p><p>As in O3, 7/4 is always within a cent of just. The main and very<br/>gentle &quot;downside&quot; is that 7/6 and 13/8 are consistently just over<br/>2 cents from just, at 264.844 cents (2.027 cents narrow) and<br/>842.578 cents (2.050 cents wide); whereas in O3, they have these<br/>sizes, plus others closer to just at 266.016 cents (0.855 cents<br/>narrow) and 841.406 cents (0.879 cents wide).</p><p>Thus MET-24 can be seen as a system willing to make small<br/>compromises with other intervals in order to favor 3/2 and 4/3.<br/>This is much the same kind of question as occurs in meantone,<br/>with the philosophy of MET-24 about like this, &quot;That temperament<br/>which tempers slightly less may be tempering slightly better.&quot;</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Tuning culture and rank-3 spacing: Comparing ZEO and POTE<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A possible distinction between ZEO and allied techniques used in<br/>the design of O3 and MET-24, and the RMP model with its POTE<br/>optimization, is the influence of an epimore-oriented technique<br/>on rank-3 spacing: the distance between the two chains of<br/>fifths.</p><p>With ZEO, the ratios 12/11 and 13/12 have great weight; while<br/>14/13 and -- in systems below 704 cents -- also 11/10 are of<br/>interest, these arise from a single chain of fifths, rather than<br/>from the third or spacing generator.</p><p>With POTE, if I understand it correctly, 11/8 and 13/8 would be<br/>the primary goals, rather than 12/11 and 13/12 at respectively a<br/>step lower on a chain of fifths all tempered in the wide<br/>direction.</p><p>It is significant that in both O3 and in MET-24, 12/11 and 13/12<br/>are always within a cent of just, while 11/8 and 13/8 have an<br/>impurity typically of around 2-3 cents, with a greater weight<br/>placed on 13/8, since it is more likely to arise above a drone in<br/>a Near Eastern context than 11/8 for example. In both tunings,<br/>13/8 is thus usually or always 2.050 cents wide; and 11/8 either<br/>1.807 or 2.979 cents wide.</p><p>All these values are within three cents of just, or the HTT<br/>tolerance of 3.247 cents. Yet epimores rather than primes are<br/>clearly favored. Also, ratios of 7 are somewhat compromised in<br/>favor of ratios of 11 and especially 13, with the about equal<br/>impurity of 7/6 and 13/8 being a characteristic feature of these<br/>tunings. This does not, however, favor 9/7, which is realized at<br/>438.281 or 439.453 cents, respectively 3.197 or 4.369 cents wide<br/>of pure (435.084 cents). The first is comparable to HTT-29<br/>(438.332 cents, at the tolerance of 3.247 cents wide), but the<br/>second and larger size more of a near-just 352/273 (440.009<br/>cents) at a 352:351 wider than 9/7.</p><p>The overall effect of ZEO, and also the general guideline that<br/>below 704 cents or so one tends to seek an eigenmonzo of 7/4<br/>rather than 7/6 (a contrast in strategies exemplified by 29-HTT<br/>and Peppermint), is to favor less spacing that one would find in<br/>POTE Parapyth, with a difference on the order of 1-2 cents.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5. Unintended consequences: approximations of 5-limit thirds<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>One feature of the above optimization philosophy and process for<br/>O3 and MET-24 would normally go without saying, but may bear<br/>mention here: while the 11/10 large neutral second does play an<br/>important rule in this optimization of a single 12-note chain,<br/>and gives rise to some fascinating commas (either tempered out or<br/>sometimes possibly &quot;observed,&quot; as with the two values of 26/21 in<br/>O3, both within a cent but the smaller yet better representing<br/>99/80 at a 2080:2079 smaller), simple ratios of 5 are simply not<br/>a consideration in the process.</p><p>Rather, a few small major and large minor thirds from the<br/>augmented second (9 fifths up) plus spacing, or diminished fourth<br/>(8 fourths up) less spacing, &quot;go with the territory,&quot; much like<br/>the diminished fourth or augmented second in 16th-century<br/>meantone. Just as these meantone intervals were used for some<br/>very striking special effects, but likely not seen as part of the<br/>basic optimization process, so the near-5 thirds of O3 or MET-24<br/>are seen as an incidental but enriching and diversifying aspect<br/>of a mainly 2.3.7.11.13 system.</p><p>It is rather like setting the other parameters, many of them<br/>described above, and then, as a sort of bonus, finding out which<br/>shade of meantone-quality thirds one has picked out of the hat,<br/>comparable to 1/5-comma or 1/6-comma in O3 and MET-24, and more<br/>to 1/7-comma in Peppermint.</p><p>One point is that these approximate ratios of 5 -- for example<br/>5/4 at 391.406 cents or 392.578 cents (5.093 or 6.264 cents wide)<br/>in O3, the former size also appearing in MET-24 along with a<br/>smaller one at 390.234 cents (3.921 cents wide) -- are not<br/>related, at least in any simple and direct way, to the<br/>optimization of the more complex ratio 11/10, also involving<br/>prime 5. More indirectly, however, there is a certain connection.</p><p>When I say &quot;at least in any direct or simple way,&quot; I mean that<br/>the optimization for 11/10 involves a single 12-note chain of<br/>fifths, while the incidental but predictable 5-limit or<br/>meantone-quality thirds result from a more complicated<br/>interaction of the linear generator (fifth or fourth) and the<br/>spacing between chains.</p><p>Where the quest for 11/10 does play a role seems to be function<br/>more generally of the quest for a large neutral second somewhat<br/>larger than 160 cents (the value at an even 704 cents). Rather<br/>than 11/10, for example, we might optimize for 208/189 at 165.837<br/>cents, a ratio in Ibn Sina&apos;s tetrachord 9:8-14:13-208:189, with<br/>identical results. This 13-limit ratio is actually larger than<br/>11/10 by the small and friendly comma of 2080:2079 (0.833 cents),<br/>but would still be within 3 cents of just in MET-24 at the value<br/>used for 11/10, 162.891 cents (2.946 cents narrow of 208/189).<br/>Thus optimizing 14/13, 13/12, 12/11, and 208/189 with all<br/>consistently within 3 cents of just would define a 1024-EDO<br/>tuning identical to that based on the kindred epimore 11/10.</p><p>The effect of this quest, be it for al-Farabi&apos;s 11/10 or Ibn<br/>Sina&apos;s 208/189, is to favor a smaller linear generator, or more<br/>precisely in 1024-EDO a bitmap or halftoning pattern with a smaller<br/>average generator of 703.711 cents for O3.</p><p>This effect tends to favor somewhat more accurate 5-limit or<br/>meantone-quality thirds, assuming a spacing for a pure 7/4,<br/>simply because the size of the 63/52 small neutral third from<br/>nine generators up grows or shrinks at rate nine times that of<br/>the fifth, while that of the 22/13 major sixth changes at only<br/>three times that of the fifth.</p><p>At 702.915 cents, a point well below 29-EDO (703.447 cents) and<br/>the slightly higher range of O3 and MET-24, the diminished fifth<br/>is a just 7/5 (582.512 cents), and this eigenmonzo makes it<br/>possible for the same spacing to produce a just 5/4 and 7/4.<br/>Taking the difference between our actual fifth and this size, and<br/>multiplying the difference by six, will yield the impurity of 5/4<br/>in the wide direction for a spacing at which 7/4 is pure.</p><p>For simplicity, let us calculate based on the average of our two<br/>sizes of fifths in MET-24, 703.711 cents or 1201/2048 octave.<br/>The difference from our 7/5 eigenmonzo fifth at 702.915 cents is<br/>about 0.796 cents, with an impurity for 5/4 of 4.778 cents. In<br/>practice, it is either 3.921 cents or 5.093 cents.</p><p>More specifically, a 63/52 augmented second tempered at 332.812<br/>cents or 333.984 cents (just size 332.208 cents) plus the spacing<br/>of 57.422 cents yields thirds of 390.234 cents or 391.406 cents.</p><p>While these are certainly pleasant meantone-quality shadings<br/>interestingly filling a role analogous to the exotic remote<br/>intervals of meantone, which might be used sparingly or<br/>adventurously as an additional resource, another aspect of the<br/>5-limit situation reveals a situation which, although a<br/>consequence rather than a deliberate calculation of the<br/>optimization process, seems felicitously to fit the ZEO ideal.</p><p>If we look at the basic 5-prime limit intervals of O3 or MET-24,<br/>we find that the best is that of the epimore 10/9, used as a<br/>melodic step in Ptolemy&apos;s Equable Diatonic 12:11:10:9 along with<br/>the 12/11 and 11/10 steps included in the ZEO process. The 6/5<br/>minor third is a bit less accurate, and 5/4 a bit yet less so --<br/>a logical situation in a system where epimore steps are especially<br/>favored, but not so much, I would guess, in a POTE optimization.</p><p>Looking at the chain of fifths for these 5-limit intervals in O3<br/>and MET-24, with 27/20 also very accurate, may illustrate these<br/>points. Here an asterisk (*) shows a note on the upper chain of<br/>fifths raised by the rank-3 spacing generator.</p><p>O3 tuning system</p><p>       680.449     182.404    884.359   386.314  1088.269<br/>        40/27       10/9        5/3       5/4      15/8<br/>          E*         B*          F#*      C#*       G#*<br/>       679.688     183.904    887.109   391.406  1095.703<br/>       -0.761      +1.581     +2.751    +5.093    -7.434</p><p>         Bb<br/>         1/1<br/>          0</p><p>MET-24 tuning system</p><p>       680.449     182.404    884.359   386.314  1088.269<br/>        40/27       10/9        5/3       5/4      15/8<br/>          E*         B*          F#*      C#*       G#*<br/>       679.688     183.904    887.109   391.406  1094.531<br/>       -0.761      +1.581     +2.751    +5.093    -6.263</p><p>         Bb<br/>         1/1<br/>          0</p><p>All these intervals are of meantone quality in either tuning, not<br/>as a feature of the design but as a natural consequence of that<br/>design, with the near-just 10/9 step as a wonderful gift for<br/>various ancient Greek and medieval Near Eastern tetrachords.<br/>Another curious effect is that by the point where we reach 15/8,<br/>the wide fifths have tempered this interval to the point where it<br/>is a near-just 32/17 (just size 1095.445 cents). To a list of<br/>commas tempered out, this adds 256/255 (6.776 cents), the<br/>septendecimal kleisma or difference between 16/15 and 17/16.</p><p>In their role as rare and valued supplementary intervals, the 5/4<br/>and 6/5 thirds would be fine in any shading from just to 12-EDO;<br/>but, as it happens, the ZEO principle as applied to neutral<br/>epimore steps, specifically 13/12 and 12/11, tends to keep these<br/>5-limit intervals a bit closer to just, although I am only now<br/>considering this relationship after over a year with MET-24!</p><p>One constraint on spacing is the precept: &quot;Cherish and nurture<br/>the 144/143,&quot; that is, the comma distinguishing a smaller central<br/>neutral second at 13/12 from a larger one at 12/11. These steps<br/>have just values of 138.573 and 150.637 cents, with the comma<br/>thus at 12.064 cents. &quot;Nurturing the 144/143&quot; means trying to<br/>keep it around this just size.</p><p>In 03, where 13/12 is always at its smaller 1024-EDO<br/>approximation of 138.281 cents (also the more accurate one), this<br/>precept is realized in almost ideal fashion: 12/11 is at 150.000<br/>or 151.172 cents, and the comma thus at 10 or 11 tuning steps:<br/>either 11.719 cents or 12.891 cents. Thus the 144/143 itself is,<br/>so to speak, &quot;virtually just.&quot;</p><p>In MET-24, there is a slight compromise: with 13/12 at either<br/>138.281 or 139.453 cents, and 12/11 always at 150.000 cents, the<br/>144/143 is tempered a bit on the narrow side at 10.547 or 11.719<br/>cents. Here the interest is not only in keeping 144/143 as close<br/>to just as possible, but in maintaining a certain degree of<br/>subtle contrast between the smaller 13/12 and larger 12/11.</p><p>While the MET-24 compromise is quite acceptable one, enlarging<br/>the spacing in this region (703.7-703.9 cents, say) to seek a<br/>just 7/6 rather than a just 7/4, for example, would further<br/>temper the 144/143 in the narrow direction by simultaneously<br/>enlarging the 13/12 (limma plus spacing) and compressing the<br/>12/11 (9/8 less spacing). The melodic imperative of ZEO, which<br/>embraces not only epimore steps but commas, thus favors a<br/>144/143-friendly spacing, with various ramifications either<br/>calculated or simply accepted.</p><p>One of those ramifications which only this dialogue has called to<br/>my attention is that the precepts of ZEO may actually tend to<br/>improve 5-limit thirds, although this was not part of the<br/>original calculation!</p><p>In going from Peppermint based on Keenan Pepper&apos;s Noble Fifth<br/>tuning (2/1, 704.096, 58.680) to O3 and then MET-24, I noticed<br/>that the 5-limit approximations seemed to be getting closer to<br/>just, but did not look into the details.</p><p>However, as is now clear, both the choice of a smaller generator<br/>(or average generator, in 1024-ED0) and ZEO spacing preferences<br/>tend to improve these 5-limit thirds.</p><p>A possible further ramification might be that people who do not<br/>share a musical outlook where the ZEO ethos is important, but who<br/>do deliberately seek 5-limit thirds in Parapyth rank-3 systems of<br/>this kind, might emulate a ZEO style of spacing (e.g. leaning<br/>toward an eigenmonzo of 7/4 rather than 7/6 in the general range<br/>of 703.6-703.9 cents) for the purpose of improving these thirds.</p><p>For someone coming from a ZEO ethos, the epimoric neutral steps<br/>are the main point, with the more accurate 5-limit approximations<br/>as an interesting ramification. For someone seeking a deliberate<br/>5-limit optimization (possibly in a larger tuning size than 24),<br/>the more accurate structure of superparticular or epimoric<br/>neutral steps would likewise be an unintended although hopefully<br/>not unpleasant consequence.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>October 31, 2012</p></div><h3><a id=105251 href="#105251">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2012 2:08:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Clearly you see POTE Parapyth at (2/1, 703.856, 58.339) as in a<br/>&gt;&gt; different category than the 13/9, 7/6 eigenmonzo tuning at what I<br/>&gt;&gt; believe from the linear generator and eigenmonzos must be a tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; of (2/1, 703.782, 59.308).</p><p>&gt;  Actually, I don&apos;t.

And I apologize for any<br/>complications my &quot;newbieness&quot; may have introduced into my first<br/>attempts at a JI transversal!</p><p>&gt;&gt; More specifically, if I understand correctly, you see MET-24 as<br/>&gt;&gt; falling more within Pele because it is closer to your 13/9, 7/6<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning than to POTE Parapyth.</p><p>&gt; Analyzing MET-24 on the basis of your met24.scl file shows it makes<br/>&gt; the most sense interpreted as a no-fives parapyth scale, though of<br/>&gt; course you can also &quot;extend&quot; it to a pele usage. You had another<br/>&gt; file with 5-limit intervals explicitly in it; I wouldn&apos;t equate the<br/>&gt; two.</p><p>That file was really a mistake on my part, and I apologize for the<br/>confusion!</p><p>Our views of MET-24 agree: a 2.3.7.11.13 parapyth. And I&apos;ve learned<br/>that one good test of a valid transversal is that the 22 usual fifths,<br/>11 in each chain, have three and only three JI sizes: 3/2, 273/242, or<br/>44/39.</p><p>Also, as I&apos;ll discuss in another post, defining the large neutral step<br/>at 162.891 cents as a tempering of Ibn Sina&apos;s 208/189 (the 32/27<br/>complement of 14/13) rather than 11/10 might avoid a lot of<br/>complications! In my tuning, 208/189 is still within 3 cents of just,<br/>and given the tempering out of 352/351, my tempering could also<br/>represent 169/154, for example (the difference of 13/11 and 14/13).</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know what O3 is.</p><p>It&apos;s a temperament with a linear generator very close to the POTE, but<br/>a bit less spacing: (2/1, 703.893, 57.148) in its theoretical form<br/>with 21/11, 7/4, and 11/6 just. The 1024-EDO version has the 22 usual<br/>fifths average out at 703.871 cents, again very close to the POTE, and<br/>again with a bit narrower spacing (57.422 cents).</p><p>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_91499.html#91499">/tuning/topicId_91499.html#91499</a>&gt;<br/>  &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_105023.html#105224">/tuning/topicId_105023.html#105224</a>&gt;</p><p>In fact, in my old-fashioned sense as well as the RMP sense of<br/>Parapyth, O3 and the later MET-24 are simply two shadings of the same<br/>basic temperament, with the latter seeking to go a bit easier on the<br/>fifths and get a bit closer to the 165-cent region of large neutral<br/>seconds (162.9 rather than 161.7 cents).</p><p>Comparing O3 and the POTE may be especially instructive because the<br/>linear generators are almost identical, which lets us see what Ivor<br/>Darreg might have called the advantages and disadvantages of different<br/>nuances of spacing. What immediately appears is that the POTE is much<br/>kinder to 9/7, and 2-3-7-9 intervals generally. A pure 7/6 would be<br/>the minimax solution for these intervals, and the POTE gets closer<br/>than O3, which is giving more weight to 13/8 and 11:12:13.</p><p>It&apos;s like a range of tastes in shades of meantone, but &quot;with two<br/>points in that space of tunings&quot; -- linear generator and spacing,<br/>assuming the octave is fixed at either 2/1 or TOP or whatever.</p><p>By the way, with your Cantonpenta, I noticed you chose 271-EDO, which<br/>has an outstanding fit, but curiously with a narrowish spacing at<br/>57.565 cents -- which this EDO pretty much selects for us. Humorously,<br/>I wondered if this could almost be an example my style of spacing<br/>maybe carried a bit further: it does wonders for 11/8, 13/8, and 11/6,<br/>and actually in this range right around a just 14/13 is more sparing<br/>of 9/7 than around MET-24 (703.711 cents) or even O3 (703.893 cents).</p><p>What I did to get a possible 34-note parapyth superset of Cantonpenta<br/>in 271-EDO was to recognize your scale as a subset of a 17-MOS,<br/>generate the 17-MOS, and then set a spacing of 13 steps of 271-EDO for<br/>a second chain.</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/cantonpentalike34.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/cantonpentalike34.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>Did I get this right?

In my vocabulary, that makes it a tuning of parapyth temperament, specifically the one with 21/11, 7/4 and 11/6 as eigenmonzos, or equivalently you can just say 2, 7 and 11/3. One nice thing about transversals is you can take the transversal and put into POTE, O3 or any other parapyth tuning which strikes your fancy.</p><p>&gt; What I did to get a possible 34-note parapyth superset of Cantonpenta<br/>&gt; in 271-EDO was to recognize your scale as a subset of a 17-MOS,<br/>&gt; generate the 17-MOS, and then set a spacing of 13 steps of 271-EDO for<br/>&gt; a second chain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/cantonpentalike34.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/cantonpentalike34.scl</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did I get this right?
