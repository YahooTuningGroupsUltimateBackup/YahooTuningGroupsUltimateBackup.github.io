I used the nth. root of 2 to make the<br/>calculations.  I placed these values on a grid, but now would like to<br/>employ a clearer computer representation.</p><p>     Does anyone know of a way --- with any of the Microsoft Office<br/>programs --- on Windows 95 --- to take a column of a given length and then<br/>have it automatically divided into n. divisions.</p><p>     This is inspired by Easley Blackwood&apos;s Microtonal Etudes in which he<br/>does these divisions &amp; writes compositions to illustrate their respective<br/>properties.</p><p>     Thanks,  Peter</p></div>
