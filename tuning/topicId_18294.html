I shall write my answer in parts on distinct<br/>posts from time to time. (I don&apos;t have much time to write).</p><p>I would like, first, to thank Paul Erlich who invited me, after &quot;my last<br/>message&quot;, to compare periodicity blocks with gammiers. I explored this link<br/>particularly in january and found a great richness permitting to elucidate<br/>questions about complexity dimension. I&apos;m working with that to a theory of<br/>convex bodies in primal lattices.</p><p>I would like also to thank Dan Stearns for his questions. I mentioned at<br/>end of &quot;my last message&quot; the need for questions. I needed the Dan&apos;s<br/>questions to organize simply, in a flash, a good part of my research. I<br/>don&apos;t have time to write a paper now, so it&apos;s an opportunity to order<br/>partially a profusion of discoveries.</p><p>The first part is like an introduction. Subsequently I shall write, by<br/>example, about generalized Stern-Brocot tree in lattices. At the end of<br/>this part it will be possile to give a better idea of the subjects to come.</p><p>                                Part I</p><p>I recall the first question of Dan Stearns in the message 18294 :</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>   (1) Given any arbitrary three-term scale (i.e., a scale made up of &quot;a&quot;<br/>   amount of small steps, &quot;b&quot; amount of medium steps, and &quot;c&quot; amount of<br/>   large steps), what global rule could govern their arrangement so as to<br/>   insure that the resulting scale is trivalent (i.e., has three sizes of<br/>   intervals in every unique interval class)?<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Let A &lt; B &lt; C be rational numbers corresponding to the steps such that</p><p>                   a log A + b log B + c log C = log 2</p><p>In rational systems these scales are subsets in abelian groups &lt;2,p&gt; or<br/>&lt;2,p,q&gt; which contain all integer power combinations of the factors between<br/>the &lt;&gt;. However I will neglect the case &lt;2,p&gt; for the complexity level in<br/>&lt;2,p&gt; has to be too high to be musically pertinent. So the number of steps,<br/>here, equals the base dimension. The numbers p and q are, in theory, simply<br/>independant rational numbers but they are pratically small prime numbers<br/>like 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...</p><p>We search here global relations independant of the prime numbers used,<br/>therefore we search consistency in modular relations. By isomorphy, all<br/>intervals are represented in the base [log 2 log p log q] by a unique<br/>coordinate vector (x1,x2,x3). (This property results from equality<br/>mentioned about steps and coordinates). I note also the coordinates by (x1<br/>x2 x3)* where (*) indicate, as a transpose sign, that the vector is a<br/>column matrix.</p><p>We know soon the number of classes (a + b + c), the degree of octave. How<br/>are determined these classes? The classes are simply the quotient-group<br/>&lt;2,p,q&gt;/&lt;r,s&gt; were r and s are the &quot;commas&quot; of Hellegouarch, or the &quot;unison<br/>vectors&quot; of Fokker, or the &quot;modal srutis&quot; in my terminology. The group<br/>&lt;r,s&gt; is the subgroup of &lt;2,p,q&gt; generated by the linear power combinations<br/>of the vectors r and s.</p><p>By equality of dimensions (here) and for we know the order of the steps,<br/>the modal srutis r and s are easily determined. It&apos;s simply B - A and C - B<br/>represented by the vectors</p><p>  (B1-A1  B2-A2  B3-A3)* = (r1 r2 r3)*</p><p>  (C1-B1  C2-B2  C3-B3)* = (s1 s2 s3)*.</p><p>Let X = (x y z)* represent any interval. The image D of X (degree of X) by<br/>the epimorphism applying intervals on Z corresponds to the determinant of<br/>the matrix (X s r).</p><p>  D = D(X) = det (X s r) =</p><p>      (x s1 r1)<br/>  det (y s2 r2) = x det (s2 r2) + y det (s3 r3) + z det (s1 r1)<br/>      (z s3 r3)         (s3 r3)         (s1 r1)         (s2 r2)</p><p>So D has the form  x D1 + y D2 + z D3.</p><p>We could say also that D is the scalar product of X by (D1 D2 D3)* which is<br/>the vectorial product of s and r.</p><p>If X = (1 0 0)* then D = D1, the degree of the octave (or the number of<br/>classes modulo 2), for this X represents 2.</p><p>If X = (0 1 0)* then D = D2, the degree of p, for this X represents p.<br/>If X = (0 0 1)* then D = D3, the degree of q, for this X represents q.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Let A &lt; B &lt; C be 9/8 &lt; 8/7 &lt; 7/6 represented in [log 2 log 3 log 7] by</p><p>  (-3 2 0)* &lt; (3 0 -1)* &lt; (-1 -1 1)*</p><p>Then r and s correspond to (6 -2 -1)* and (-4 -1 2)* which are the modal<br/>srutis 64/63 and 49/48. The degree function is</p><p>              (x -4  6)<br/>   D(X) = det (y -1 -2) = 5x + 8y + 14 z<br/>              (z  2 -1)</p><p>So in the slendro family, there are 5 degrees in which the harmonic 3<br/>corresponds to degree 3 (for 8 mod 5 = 3) and the harmonic 7 to degree 4<br/>(for 14 mod 5 = 4). And we can verify that A, B and C have degree 1 :</p><p>D(9/8) = D(-3,2,0)  = (5)(-3) + (8)(2)  + (14)(0)  = 1<br/>D(8/7) = D(3,0,-1)  = (5)(3)  + (8)(0)  + (14)(-1) = 1<br/>D(7/6) = D(-1,-1,1) = (5)(-1) + (8)(-1) + (14)(1)  = 1</p><p>---</p><p>Let A &lt; B &lt; C be 16/15 &lt; 10/9 &lt; 9/8 represented in base log &lt;2,3,5&gt; by</p><p>  (4 -1 -1)* &lt; (1 -2 1)* &lt; (-3 2 0)*</p><p>Then r and s correspond to (-3 -1 2)* and (-4 4 -1)*, which are the modal<br/>srutis 25/24 and 81/80.  Then D(x,y,z) is</p><p>             (x -4 -3)<br/>  D(X) = det (y  4 -1) = 7x + 11y + 16 z<br/>             (z -1  2)</p><p>So in the Zarlino family, there are 7 degrees in which the harmonic 3<br/>corresponds to degree 4 (for 11 mod 7 = 4) and the harmonic 5 to degree 2<br/>(for 16 mod 7 = 2). Verifying tonal generator we find :</p><p>D(16/15) = D(4,-1,-1) = (7)(4)  + (11)(-1) + (16)(-1) = 1<br/>D(10/9)  = D(1,-2,1)  = (7)(1)  + (11)(-2) + (16)(1)  = 1<br/>D(9/8)   = D(-3,2,0)  = (7)(-3) + (11)(2)  + (16)(0)  = 1</p><p>---</p><p>Returning to the question, the following relation express the independance<br/>of the numbers 2, p and q. Let (A1 A2 A3)* (B1 B2 B3)* (C1 C2 C3)* be the<br/>coordinates of A, B and C. Then</p><p>  (A1 B1 C1) (a)   (A1*a + B1*b + C1*c)   (1)<br/>  (A2 B2 C2) (b) = (A2*a + B2*b + C2*c) = (0)<br/>  (A3 B3 C3) (c)   (A3*a + B3*b + C3*c)   (0)</p><p>To reach the octave, an equal amount of p (or q) have to be used in<br/>numerator and denominator while an excedent 2 is required. This is the<br/>basic constraint.</p><p>----------</p><p>So far it&apos;s only trite remarks. Now concerning</p><p>&lt;&lt; to insure that the resulting scale is trivalent (i.e., has three sizes<br/>   of intervals in every unique interval class) &gt;&gt;</p><p>I could say that we have just seen there exist an infinity of intervals for<br/>each classes and that the question is to determine the three pertinent<br/>intervals for each classes (except unison). I will show that they are<br/>contained in a convex shape (easily calculated) around the unison.</p><p>We could question the necessity to use three values for each classes but<br/>without using the gammier theory, this level is out of reach (I want here<br/>to restrict my comments to Z-module properties).</p><p>This new subject is more sophisticated so I will begin with remarks to give<br/>a better contextualization.</p><p>---</p><p>First we have to note that, independantly of prime numbers used (that we<br/>suppose to be not too high), it subsists in lattice (or Z-module)<br/>representation, a component of the global complexity that I will name, for<br/>the time being, &quot;modular complexity&quot;. For each interval represented by<br/>(x,y,z) this modular complexity corresponds to the sum of the absolute<br/>value of the coordinates.</p><p>  MC = MC(X) = |x| + |y| + |z|</p><p>So MC is 0 for unison (0 0 0)* and grows up in any direction. Knowing prime<br/>numbers, we could adjust relative rate of growing in different axis and<br/>calculate complexity or sonance :</p><p>  complexity = 2^|x| * p^|y| * q^|z|</p><p>  sonance = |x|*log 2 + |y|*log p + |z|*log q</p><p>But independently of primal base used we can understand the importance to<br/>use for each class of intervals those of minimal complexity which are<br/>forcely located around the unison. We are not interested here in metric of<br/>complexity but in topological invariance using MC in place of complexity.</p><p>  ( Beside, I suggest than N-limit is more pertinent with<br/>    complexity than with odds or primes. Convexity has really<br/>    sense with complexity in constrast with the two others.<br/>    Convexity means constraint to use all possibilities<br/>    within the limit. It would be easy to show, by some<br/>    examples, like slendro scales, the non-pertinence of<br/>    convexity for odds and primes, and I found that the<br/>    pertinent tonal structures are convex bodies.)</p><p>As alternative to MC, we can use MC2 = sqrt (xx + yy + zz), the usual<br/>euclidian norm, in plunging our Z-module in R^3, to analyse ball containers<br/>of intervals behind a limit of complexity. It&apos;s particularly helping in<br/>dimension &gt; 3 to figure a parallelotope having his vertex belonging to an<br/>hyperquadric.</p><p>Knowing primal base we could represent by a spherical body (in R^3) the<br/>domain containing the set of discrete intervals (of Z^3) having a maximal<br/>distance limit from unison. This distance (MC2) is a represention of the<br/>&quot;sonance&quot;. (We have to use the log of complexity, the sonance, to be linear<br/>with MC2).</p><p>This container spherical shape is not preserved by the representation in<br/>Z^3 but we expect to obtain a container ellipsoidal shape with</p><p>  1/log 2 : 1/log p : 1/log q</p><p>axis ratios and we expect that this shape be easily described by an<br/>equation using a &quot;diagonal&quot; matrix M such that</p><p>  (x y z) M (x y z)* = K</p><p>---</p><p>Another important remark concerns the effect of octave modularity on MC and<br/>MC2. Independently of primal base, octave modularity means using &lt;p,q&gt;<br/>rather than &lt;2,p,q&gt;. Thus we have to use only &quot;reduced modular complexity&quot;<br/>with RMC = |y| + |z| and RMC2 = sqrt (yy + zz). So we can easily understand<br/>that RMC and RMC2 are globaly more reduced relatively to MC and MC2 if</p><p>                        yz &gt; 1 rather than  yz &lt; 1.</p><p>For example the intervals 15/8 and 5/3 have the same RMC = 2, but they have<br/>respectively 5 and 2 for the MC ; the intervals 45/32 and 9/5 have also the<br/>same RMC = 3, but respectively 8 and 3 for the MC.</p><p>By principle, if y and z in (y,z) have the same sign we can expect a great<br/>value of |x| to obtain an interval of the first octave.</p><p>So a cube domain (having vertex on axis) with norm MC &lt; K in &lt;2,p,q&gt; would<br/>appear as a compressed hexagonal shape rotated counterclockwise in &lt;p,q&gt;.<br/>We expect, with usual euclidian norm, that our ellipsoid container would<br/>appear also like a counterclockwise rotated ellipse responding to the equation</p><p>  (1 y z) M (1 y z)* = K</p><p>But the matrix M would be no more diagonal and would have the form</p><p>      (1 0 0)<br/>  M = (0 a d)<br/>      (0 d c)</p><p>So</p><p>          (1 0 0)<br/>  (1 y z) (0 a d) (1 y z)* = K<br/>          (0 d c)</p><p>  axx + bxy + cyy = K  (where b = 2d)</p><p>---</p><p>I will anticipate on arguments here to give now examples insuring that this<br/>abstracted matter has sense in tonal structures.</p><p>By periodicity, the vectors s, r+s, r, -s, -r-s and -s determine 6 limit<br/>points of complexity. (We will develop that later, and we will use the<br/>convex hexagonal outline to study the algebraic properties). But we can<br/>exhibit now the elliptic container of complexity determined by A, B and C<br/>which satisfied to the six points. By symmetry, the s, s+r and r values are<br/>sufficient to calculate this ellipse.</p><p>In the first example we had r = (6 -2 -1)* and s = (-4 -1 2)*. So the<br/>points are (-1,2) (-3,1) (-2,-1) and we have to solve :</p><p>    a - 2b + 4c = K<br/>   9a - 3b +  c = K<br/>   4a + 2b +  c = K</p><p>We find easily the quadratic form 3xx + 3xy + 7yy = K and we may verify<br/>that the six points give K = 25 the square of classes.</p><p>In the second example we had r = (-3 -1 2)* and s = (-4 4 -1)*. So the<br/>points are (4,-1) (3,1) (-1,2) and we have to solve :</p><p>  16a - 4b +  c = K<br/>   9a + 3b +  c = K<br/>    a - 2b + 4c = K</p><p>We find easily the ellipses family 3xx + 3xy + 13yy = K and we may verify<br/>that the six points give K = 49 the square of classes.</p><p>  ( We can note, in this case, that the elliptic shape<br/>    contains erroneously the points (4,0) and (-4,0)<br/>    with K = 48 which are 81/64 and 128/81. So the<br/>    approximative euclidian norm fail here. Strictly,<br/>    only the hexagonal shape inside, as we will see,<br/>    is truly periodical -- while ellipses may overlap --<br/>    and contains exclusively the three intervals of<br/>    minimal complexity for each classes. But this<br/>    hexagonal shape has his vertex located on the<br/>    calculated ellipse. And all that is generalizable<br/>    at N dimensions. )</p><p>By anticipation we presumed here that the set of intervals included in the<br/>hexagonal shape corresponds strictly to the three periodical blocks of less<br/>complexity. These blocks of one interval by class surround unison and have<br/>only unison as intersection, so we have with N = a + b + c classes only the<br/>3N-2 intervals searched. With gammier theory we could go deeper and<br/>consider, with algebraic arguments, lesser numbers N of intervals included<br/>in the first shape and see that these subsets are also convex bodies.</p><p>The two precedent examples permit to see how the ideal N-limit ball of<br/>sonance (which has, by definition of sonance, a cubic form in R^3 with his<br/>vertex on primal axis) is approximately approched by systems with<br/>epimorphism to Z (i.e. having classes). The hexagonal shape correspond to<br/>the sonance parallepiped defined by sonance limit of the modal srutis.</p><p>The following figures show an image of our slendro and zarlino examples. We<br/>see the hexagonal shape defined by r and s vectors and the three periodical<br/>blocks of 5 and 7 distinct classes surrounding unison. The intervals of<br/>degree 1 and -1 are colored. In the second example, we distinct the 13<br/>intervals of the Zarlino gammier among the complete 19 intervals gammier<br/>(using harmonic 27 and 45). So we see how modulation at dominant or<br/>sub-dominant keeps the confinement.</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/r8.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/r8.gif</a></p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/r7.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/r7.gif</a></p><p>----------</p><p>I stop here the introduction. In the following parts I shall show how a<br/>universal matrix transform successively a given periodical block in the<br/>other surrounding blocks. In dimension N, this matrix appears as a root N+1<br/>of the identity matrix. If we change negative signs in this matrix by<br/>positive signs, the successive powers exibit N-bonacci series and we have<br/>the analogy of Fibonacci in 2D. We can also construct an analog of Stern-<br/>Brocot tree with N branches.</p><p>Beside, I found a simple method to represent 3D and 4D lattices using<br/>Tribonacci series. It&apos;s so simple I imagine it&apos;s already known. If not<br/>I shall show that.</p><p>I don&apos;t give other details.

Of course, the interior the sphere, even if it<br/>has an area of 31 or 41 or 72 or whatever, is not necessarily going to be a<br/>periodicity block -- there could easily be two ratios in one equivalence<br/>class and no ratios in another -- but a little rearragement could result in<br/>a parallelopiped, hexagonal prism, or rhombic dodecahedron [or higher- (or<br/>lower-) dimensional analogues] that is a periodicity block. This is because<br/>sphere&apos;s don&apos;t tile space -- if you try to fill space with identical<br/>spheres, there are spaces between the spheres, or they overlap, or both.<br/>Anyway, Paul Hahn and I talked a bit about this very idea -- see the<br/>archives.</p><p>&gt;Beside, I found a simple method to represent 3D and 4D lattices using<br/>&gt;Tribonacci series.

(also a well known result, but not quite so much so as the volume of the parallelopiped).</p><p>Since the vectors that define the parallelopiped are also vectors joining lattice points, then in fact,<br/>the determinant gives the number of distinct points in the lattice up to equivalence<br/>by its three defining vectors.</p><p>So far, this is just a brief summary of the notion of a periodicity block.</p><p>Now, the interesting move, you want to make a scale with three step sizes<br/>A, B and C, where A, B and C are expressible in terms of (2,p,q).</p><p>So you choose r = B-A, s = C-B.</p><p>where here we are talking about vector subtraction,</p><p>r= (B1-A1  B2-A2  B3-A3)* = (r1 r2 r3)*</p><p>s=  (C1-B1  C2-B2  C3-B3)* = (s1 s2 s3)*.</p><p>As ratios, r=B/A, and s = C/B</p><p>In other words, you are treating lattice points as<br/>equivalent if you can get from one to another<br/>via B/A, or via C/B.</p><p>So for example if the steps are 9/8, 10/9 and 16/15<br/>and if you start the scale with 10/9, then you have to leave<br/>out 9/8 and 16/15, because they are equivalent to<br/>10/9 under the unison vectors r and s.</p><p>Continuing with the diatonic j.i. steps<br/>9/8, 10/9 and 16/15, and these values<br/>of r, s, and using (x,y,z) = X as a third unison<br/>vector, one can find the determinant from these.</p><p>Your determinant equation gives</p><p>D(X) = 7x + 11y + 16 z</p><p>so we can immediately read off from this the<br/>number of notes you get using any other<br/>type of equivalence.</p><p>So for octave equivalence, x=1, y=0, z=0,<br/>so D(X)=7, so one has 7 notes.</p><p>For equivalence of 1/1 and 3/1<br/>as in BP type scales, you will have<br/>X = (0,1,0) (i.e. 2^0*3^1*5^0)<br/>and so x=0, y=1, z=0.</p><p>So this time, we have 11 notes.</p><p>Similarly, equivalence under 5/1 gives a scale of 16 notes.</p><p>Here, there is one point I don&apos;t quite get.<br/>You deduced that the 3/1 will be the fourth<br/>degree of the diatonic scale, and I don&apos;t quite<br/>see where you get that.</p><p>&gt; So in the Zarlino family, there are 7 degrees in which the harmonic 3<br/>&gt; corresponds to degree 4 (for 11 mod 7 = 4) and the harmonic 5 to degree 2<br/>&gt; (for 16 mod 7 = 2). Verifying tonal generator we find :</p><p>I can see that 11 mod 7 = 4, but not the connection of this to<br/>the fourth degree of the scale.</p><p>Another example:</p><p>for 9/8, 8/7 and 7/6,<br/>treating 9/8<br/>   D(X) = 5x + 8y + 14 z<br/>so one can read out that there are 5 notes up to octave equivalence.<br/>(and 8 up to equivalence under 3/1, and 14 up to equivalence under<br/>7/1)</p><p>One could also put x=-1, y=1, D(x)=3, so there are 3 notes up to<br/>equivalence by 3/2, and so forth.</p><p>Actually finding what these three notes seems a bit tricky.</p><p>(this will sometimes give negative numbers for D(X), but that is<br/>okay, as the volume is defined as abs(D(x)), and is always positive).</p><p>Are there any nice easy ways to find these three notes, or any of the scales,<br/>without doing a lot of 3D geometry?</p><p>That&apos;s about as far as I&apos;ve got, though I&apos;ve looked ahead, and<br/>see you haven&apos;t yet given the trivalence result, so look forward to see<br/>how it works out.</p><p>I expect some on the TL may have immediately understood what you<br/>are saying, but for others, this area may also be relatively new, or your<br/>approach to it is new, or some of the notation and terminology,<br/>so maybe what I&apos;ve said here will help them to ask the right questions<br/>to understand the rest of what  you have said.</p><p>I look forward to what you have to say about trivalence. I can&apos;t at<br/>present see how trivalence is going to emerge from this, and if you<br/>can do that, I&apos;m sure it will be fascinating!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18970 href="#18970">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2001 9:25:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;(1) Given any arbitrary three-term scale (i.e., a scale made up of<br/>&quot;a&quot; amount of small steps, &quot;b&quot; amount of medium steps, and &quot;c&quot; amount<br/>of large steps), what global rule could govern their arrangement so as<br/>to insure that the resulting scale is trivalent (i.e., has three sizes<br/>of intervals in every unique interval class)?&gt;&gt;</p><p>I think that a &quot;trivalent only&quot; rule and a Tribonacci expansion have<br/>to be separate conditions as an even numbered scale must result in a<br/>sixth term that is even as well; [1,1,2] for example gives a<br/>Tribonacci expansion of:</p><p>1,1,2,4,7,13,...</p><p>And a 4 note subset of 13 cannot be trivalent.</p><p>However, there I believe there is a very simple global rule that would<br/>govern arbitrary three-term indexes so that their stepsize arrangement<br/>results in a scale that is constructed of three stepsizes and<br/>trivalent in all but what I&apos;d term &quot;unique&quot; cases:</p><p>L-out-of-M-out-of-N</p><p>For a two-term index, [a,b], the global rule would lie in the<br/>Fibonacci series where any four term segment corresponds to:</p><p>a,b,M,N,...</p><p>So let&apos;s say the arbitrary two-term index is [3,11], then you&apos;d have:</p><p>3,11,14,25,...</p><p>And the L-out-of-M would be bbabbbbabbbabb:</p><p>2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2</p><p>Or:</p><p>0 2 4 5 7 9 11 13 14 16 18 20 21 23 25</p><p>For a three-term index, [a,b,c], the global rule would lie in the<br/>Tribonacci series where any six term segment would correspond to:</p><p>a,b,c,L,M,N,...</p><p>Let&apos;s say the arbitrary three-term index is [1,4,3], then you&apos;d have:</p><p>1,4,3,8,15,26,...</p><p>This would be an even numbered scale, but as the sixth term is even as<br/>well, the results should be trivalent... let&apos;s see.</p><p>M-out-of-N gives:</p><p>0 2 3 5 7 9 10 12 14 16 17 19 21 23 24 26</p><p>And L-out-of-M gives either:</p><p>0 3 7 10 14 16 19 23 26</p><p>Or:</p><p>0 3 7 10 12 16 19 23 26</p><p>Both of these are a [1,4,3], and both are trivalent.</p><p>I believe that *THIS IS THE RULE*...</p><p>The exceptional cases I believe should occupy a different class, or<br/>rather represent some distinct subgenre of these three-term scales.<br/>(And though I have yet to check or much experiment with it, I&apos;d<br/>imagine that this same principle could be carried out to other n-term<br/>scales as well with similar results.)</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
