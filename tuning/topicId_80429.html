Most music (in terms of people-hours<br/>&gt; it&apos;s listened to, or dollars spent on it, etc.) today and in the<br/>&gt; past is very simple and very consonant. It has been argued that<br/>&gt; music is marching higher up the harmonic series -- 3-limit in<br/>&gt; the medieval period, 5-limit in the classical, and the 7-limit<br/>&gt; in African-American music -- but that doesn&apos;t mean higher<br/>&gt; dissonance, and it&apos;s a debatable interpretation of history at<br/>&gt; any rate. I was listening to some 15th-century Italian music<br/>&gt; the other day, and it was remarkably similar to modern folk<br/>&gt; music. One of the galliards in particular could have been put<br/>&gt; on a CD of square dancing music and nobody would notice.<br/>&gt; So if music is changing, at least it seems to be a matter of<br/>&gt; expansion rather than linear evolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While contemporary classical music has taken this to such<br/>&gt; &gt; extremes (dodecophonic music comes to mind,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This movement is by now mostly dead, even in academic circles,<br/>&gt; and it never can claim to have been widely enjoyed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wonder if we are at a unique time in history when an alternate<br/>&gt; &gt; system all together could obtain significant traction. And in<br/>&gt; &gt; proposing this - I wonder if &quot;ultimate consonance&quot; is really the<br/>&gt; &gt; holy grail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One nice thing about tunings like 22-ET is that they contain<br/>&gt; all three of these possibilities:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. greater consonance in traditional chords (triads)<br/>&gt; 2. more consonances to choose from (e.g. 7-limit and 11-limit)<br/>&gt; 3. more and much greater dissonances available<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, a triple play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. Have to have a prayer in being executed on existing, or<br/>&gt; &gt; somewhat modified existing instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s easy to put 22 on a guitar by refretting. A relatively<br/>&gt; cheap mod. Most MIDI keyboards can do 22 or any other<br/>&gt; tuning in seconds, but to get the conceptual part of the<br/>&gt; instrument right, new keyboard layouts are unfortunately<br/>&gt; required.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My point here - perhaps abandoning 12-TET should be a conscience<br/>&gt; &gt; goal instead of a matter of trying fix the holes in the dyke.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that is the conscience goal around here!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2009 6:39:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>---Hm, not sure how you&apos;re getting that.

Modal harmony was more simple, used mainly major and minor triads and because tonality in later sense didn&apos;t exist and tonal centre was not stabilized and clearly defined, also harmonic relations are more free (and sometimes unusual, surprising and difficult to analyze from the point of view of later functional harmony). There are strange chromatic connections, sudden jumps to &quot;foreign&quot; chords etc. Of course we can find here ome typical chord progressions in embryonal state, which were stabilized and commonly used later in functional harmony, like V - I in the end and so. Also this modal music doesn&apos;t know something like &quot;modulation&quot; in later sense, as I&apos;m not aware about the only example when music would be let&apos;s say in Dorian with root note on D, and somewhere in the middle changed to Lydian on Gb. Despite the fact that chromatic scale was well known, and even used (there are nice examples even in late 14th century Ars subtilior, like Solage&apos;s Fumeaux fume), but not for modulations like this. Generally modal music disppeared very slowly somewhere between 1600-1630.</p><p>Functional harmony could start when tonality was developped, with clearly defined tonal centre, and certain chords progressions started to be used intentionally because they had different result emotionally, some made a feeling we are far from centre, therefore there&apos;s more tension, and when we came back to the centre, there was more peace. In this sense later also modulation to different key were used, to add even more - this process came to its peak in Wagner&apos;s Tristan und Isolde. And of course also chords started to be more complex - 7th, 9th in 17.-18. century to 13th in the middle of 19th century, and later even more complex with using more notes then 7 notes of diatonic scale.</p><p>I think also this is just historical view. Of course there is possible to use any historical or folklore modes and accompany them with functional harmony, but if we will keep the original mode, then possibilities will be limited even for some common basic diatonic chord progressions (depending on mode), nothing to say about more rich chromatic harmony, which will be almost restricted (like double dominants or subdominants or seventh chords, chains of double dominants or subdominants, chords or chromatic third relation, and such phenomenons like chromatic/enharmonic modulation). Chromatic note alterations would destroy original atmosphere of mode and move it in the direction to standard major/minor or chromatic, so it will not be taken as enrichment (which is the case of major/minor functional tonality), just as a return to major/minor. Also use of modulations will sound strange, as well as harmonizing of simple modal melody with rich functional harmony... But there is still some potential.</p><p>Opposite it&apos;s possible to take major/minor diatonic, pandiatonic or chromatic and use it over modal harmony. This is more promissing because melody can be more rich then harmony, which is often the case in music.</p><p>Another understanding of modality is in jazz, where complex chords are often used with old modes in melody part, or opposite chromatic melody is harmonized in modal way without traditional functional harmony relations.</p><p>Another variation on this theme showed us for example Messiaen - to create any scale and then create chords only from its notes. Even such simple scale like diminished will give interesting modal harmony far from traditional relations of functional harmony. (Here I would add that right in this he had some predecessors - Skriabin (who derived it probably from Chopin/Liszt) and Bartok (who found it in folklore)).</p><p>So functional harmony in the frame of modality has a lot of limitations, so much that I would not use a term &quot;functional&quot; for it.

Functional and exotic. The minor v chord<br/>has its own function that differs from the major V chord. bVII has its<br/>own function as well. There are a few ways to analyze those chord from<br/>a common practice standpoint - you could say that bVII is some kind of<br/>IV/IV chord, or you could say that the minor v chord is a borrowed<br/>chord from a minor key. But why try to fit everything into the<br/>major/minor system? It seems like a powerful and fairly intuitive<br/>extension of common practice theory to throw out the fairly arbitrary<br/>assertion that major and minor are the only two valid forms of<br/>tonality. If you remove that axiom from the system, you&apos;ll find you<br/>can use dorian and mixolydian and such as tonalities and that you can<br/>find functional harmonies and chords with specific &quot;functions&quot; in<br/>them.</p><p>Plus, it isn&apos;t like you&apos;re limited to only the notes in the mode<br/>you&apos;re using -- how many common practice songs written in minor really<br/>stick entirely to aeolian mode? They use V7 chords, they use harmonic<br/>minor, they use melodic minor... I&apos;m basically advocating the same<br/>type of approach to writing with modes. Instead of writing a piece in<br/>aeolian and using V7 chords occasionally and such, you can write a<br/>piece in dorian and use V7 chords occasionally. Why not?</p><p>My personal view on the matter is that a certain type of aural space<br/>is created when you have A B C D E F G A -- and a different type of<br/>aural space is created when you have A B C D E F# G A. You can throw a<br/>V7 chord in there and the G# will be incredibly dissonant and<br/>unexpected and make you beg for that i chord. So being as these<br/>feelings and emotions and shifting end up working pretty nicely when<br/>thrown into certain sequences, such as V7-i (hence functional<br/>harmony), what reason is there you couldn&apos;t feel out the &quot;emotion<br/>space&quot; for something like dorian and proceed to write music in it?<br/>Does common practice theory hold that all music written in different<br/>modes than major and minor has to be pandiatonic?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2009 11:06:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forro &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, Carl, you are right, there must be something special with<br/>&gt; Ionian an Aeolian besides the fact, that their root notes are<br/>&gt; located as neighbors of original four modes used in European<br/>&gt; music - Ionian is to the left from Dorian, Aeolian to the right<br/>&gt; from Mixolydian.</p><p>They are also the only two modes where the tonic triad is<br/>stepwise resolvable from the diminished fifth -- the only<br/>dissonant fifth in the diatonic scale.

Still it doesn&apos;t mean I will call such music modal music.<br/>&gt; , or you could say that the minor v chord is a borrowed<br/>&gt; chord from a minor key.<br/>&gt;<br/>That&apos;s difficult to say, minor V chord doesn&apos;t exist in functional harmony. Even minor tonality use major V. Only Mixolydian has minor V, so in this case we would say more exactly it&apos;s taken from Mixolydian, but that means it&apos;s not functional, but modal harmony.<br/>&gt; But why try to fit everything into the<br/>&gt; major/minor system? It seems like a powerful and fairly intuitive<br/>&gt; extension of common practice theory to throw out the fairly arbitrary<br/>&gt; assertion that major and minor are the only two valid forms of<br/>&gt; tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>Of course, compositional practice was always ahead theory which accepted new principles as a norm with some delay after their stabilization .<br/>Theory is usually only simplified generalized model derived ex post from practice. (There are some exceptions when theoretical concept came first, even in music. Don&apos;t we see a lot of examples here with tunings and scales?)<br/>All rules of functional harmony are based on major/minor music, that&apos;s the reason why it&apos;s not possible to use it fully with older modal attitude.<br/>&gt; If you remove that axiom from the system, you&apos;ll find you<br/>&gt; can use dorian and mixolydian and such as tonalities and that you can<br/>&gt; find functional harmonies and chords with specific &quot;functions&quot; in<br/>&gt; them.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, but reason why theory doesn&apos;t mix these two possible attitudes is partly historical, partly because it&apos;s difficult or in many case impossible to find harmonic functions for modal chord relations (and there&apos;s no reason to do so, it works differently than functional chord relations), or because we can use a lot of functional chord relations at all as they don&apos;t fit into the modal context.<br/>&gt; Plus, it isn&apos;t like you&apos;re limited to only the notes in the mode<br/>&gt; you&apos;re using -- how many common practice songs written in minor really<br/>&gt; stick entirely to aeolian mode? They use V7 chords, they use harmonic<br/>&gt; minor, they use melodic minor...<br/>&gt;<br/>Sorry, but pure Aeolian mode and melodic/harmonic minor are totally different things, we have to see them historically. They came from different music era. Again you mix modal and functional attitude. Which is possible but that functional one will probably win as it&apos;s historically younger and still used.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m basically advocating the same<br/>&gt; type of approach to writing with modes. Instead of writing a piece in<br/>&gt; aeolian and using V7 chords occasionally and such, you can write a<br/>&gt; piece in dorian and use V7 chords occasionally. Why not?<br/>&gt;<br/>Of course that&apos;s easily possible in compositional practice, usually pure Dorian will be in melody, and V7 in harmony, and composer will usually avoid a meeting of Dorian 7th in melody with functional 7th in harmony because it&apos;s pretty dissonant (or he will intentionally emphasize it, why not). But thanks to using V7 you destroy one of typical intervals of Dorian and make from it melodic minor. You can even use very complex jazz chords or even some totally abstract 12tone chords for harmonizing very simple modal melody. Why not. But by crossing a border between old modality and modern major/minor attitude in the direction to historically later music you give up modality.<br/>&gt; My personal view on the matter is that a certain type of aural space<br/>&gt; is created when you have A B C D E F G A -- and a different type of<br/>&gt; aural space is created when you have A B C D E F# G A. You can throw a<br/>&gt; V7 chord in there and the G# will be incredibly dissonant and<br/>&gt; unexpected and make you beg for that i chord. So being as these<br/>&gt; feelings and emotions and shifting end up working pretty nicely when<br/>&gt; thrown into certain sequences, such as V7-i (hence functional<br/>&gt; harmony), what reason is there you couldn&apos;t feel out the &quot;emotion<br/>&gt; space&quot; for something like dorian and proceed to write music in it?<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, this is possible, but then we can&apos;t call such music &quot;modal&quot; in that historical sense.<br/>&gt; Does common practice theory hold that all music written in different<br/>&gt; modes than major and minor has to be pandiatonic?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t understand what you mean by this.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2009 12:40:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p>Repair:</p><p>Yes, but reason why theory doesn&apos;t mix these two possible attitudes is partly historical, partly because it&apos;s difficult or in many case impossible to find harmonic functions for modal chord relations (and there&apos;s no reason to do so, it works differently than functional chord relations), or because we --- CAN&apos;T ---- use a lot of functional chord relations at all as they don&apos;t fit into the modal context.</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2009 3:40:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh yes, I said &quot;key&quot; in a totally different context - great come back Carl!</p><p>Yay Carl - he won!</p><p>On Tue, Feb 3, 2009 at 2:11 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Chris Vaisvil<br/>&gt; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Go back and read my message - I did not mention keys, it was you,<br/>&gt; &gt; whom I quoted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact you said it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m getting a picture, that the key, regardless of how they are<br/>&gt; &gt; generated, the difference tones are part of the key - and that<br/>&gt; &gt; a &quot;harmonious&quot; scale, at least for public consumption, would<br/>&gt; &gt; be one where the intervals created difference tones that<br/>&gt; &gt; reinforced the consonance of the interval.

It is used occasionally. But even so, to state<br/>&gt; that it serves no potential function in music makes no sense, and it<br/>&gt; certainly -exists- - we&apos;re talking about it, aren&apos;t we?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I use term &quot;function&quot; here only as technical term, for function of chord in the frame of functional harmony theory. That&apos;s the reason why this theory is called &quot;functional&quot;, it is based on &quot;functions&quot; of chord in the tonality. Functions can be for example: Tonic, Subdominant, Dominant, Mediants III and VI, then II, VII for diatonic harmony, and additionally Double Subdominant, extra-key Subdominants, Double Dominant, extra-key Dominants, extra-key VII, Lydian function (B minor chord in C minor), Phrygian function (Db major triad in C major, when used as a Subdominant substitution before Dominant, it&apos;s called Napolitan sixth chord), chords of chromatic third relation,  extra-key chords, Substitution chords... for extended tonality (chromatic).</p><p>In this theory chords don&apos;t exist just as isolated chords, but they work in context thanks to their function. For example C major triad is Tonic in C major, but as well Subdominant in G major, Mediant in A minor, Phrygian chord () in B minor or major etc. When we re-value a function of chord, we can easily modulate to the other key.</p><p>Of course minor V exists and is used, and we can determine its function in concrete musical context, but this function doesn&apos;t belong to dominant class functions. For example when it stays before II, it can be considered as Double II.  (I have solution how to indicate this minor chord on Vth step in major scale when its function is not totally explainable. We can use just V without function, as it is not Dominant function or some other.)<br/>There&apos;s another beautiful example in the end of Janacek&apos;s Taras Bulba symphonic poem: B7 on A - Gm - F7 - C9add. Can be analyzed as chord of chromatic third relation - minor V - S7 - T. That C in the function of T is very surprising, everybody would expect after Gm and F7 - Bb as a Tonic. He changed direction and didn&apos;t used dominant, but subdominant resolution. That&apos;s called creativity! I don&apos;t think he heard something about blues...</p><p>Minor chords in major tonality generally have tendency to Subdominant class, as minor Subdominant is often used, its effect with following Tonic or Dominant class chord is much stronger than major Subdominant.</p><p>This classical approach to harmony works and can explain harmony until Wagner and lot of music which followed later, but it is not quite suitable for music style which let&apos;s say Debussy started, where chords are connected freely and any chord can follow any other one.<br/>&gt; The whole point I&apos;m making is that common practice theory places<br/>&gt; arbitrary limitations on functional harmony. So if you respond that<br/>&gt; certain chords just &quot;can&apos;t be functional&quot; or &quot;don&apos;t exist in the<br/>&gt; system,&quot; that basically reinforces what I&apos;m saying. &quot;Functional<br/>&gt; harmony&quot; is a real-life concept that exists outside of common practice<br/>&gt; theory. It has to do with the colors that chords have and what chords,<br/>&gt; when placed in sequence after other chords, &quot;fit&quot; in a certain way, or<br/>&gt; lead you to expect a certain type of resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>Exactly so.<br/>&gt; Modern jazz fusion artists, like Robert Glasper, have made an entire<br/>&gt; art form out of finding weird and unexpected chord progressions in<br/>&gt; which the chords DO lead into each other for some strange reason. E7#9<br/>&gt; Absus13 C#maj9. To say that they aren&apos;t &quot;functional&quot; is wrong, because<br/>&gt; when you listen to his progressions you get the impression that they<br/>&gt; do &quot;function&quot;, but in a new and exotic way. To say that they make no<br/>&gt; sense in common practice theory, on the other hand, is correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I didn&apos;t write they are not functional, just they can be hardly analyzed from the point of the traditional (an rather limited) functional harmony. Because its rules were created years before such weird and unexpected chord sequences came into the use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Functional harmony is something independent from common practice<br/>&gt; theory. Common practice theory is an attempt to write down some of the<br/>&gt; rules of functional harmony as commonly used in the 18th-19th<br/>&gt; centuries and such. In my opinion, they tried to place restrictions on<br/>&gt; functional harmony that don&apos;t really exist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Definitely yes.<br/>&gt; What exactly do you mean by &quot;modal chord relations&quot; vs &quot;functional<br/>&gt; chord relations&quot;? And what do you mean by the &quot;modal context?&quot; Perhaps<br/>&gt; we&apos;re just differing on the terminology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Modal chord relations are chord progressions which we can find in modal music, that means until beginning of 17th century. Typical is using of old modes, chords have no harmonic function in later sense (but some of later functional progressions can be traced, like D - T in the end of compositions, where T is usually major even in minor mode), chords were connected freely, and sometimes very strange chromatic progressions appear, especially in the end of this period (chromatic madrigal by Venosa, Lasso, Marenzio...). Feelings were expressed mainly by change of mode. Composers didn&apos;t use modulations or transpositions during one composition.</p><p>When music started to work with contrast major/minor, also harmony developped into functional harmony very quickly. Feelings were expressed by intentional work with tension and peace which was possible because chords can belong to Tonic function class (maximum peace), Subdominant function class (little tension) and Dominant function class (maximum tension), later also chromatic extra-key chords came into the game. Chords became more and more complex (until 13th chord in the half of 19th century), which helped also to this process, as some chords were more dissonant, some were consonant. Composers could use also modulations to different key as a powerful expression tool.<br/>&gt; I used the word Aeolian because Carl earlier mentioned that the only<br/>&gt; two modes you can label &quot;keys&quot; are Ionian and Aeolian. I&apos;m making the<br/>&gt; point that common-practice music is almost never written using pure<br/>&gt; Aeolian mode - V7 chords and such are thrown in all the time. Hence<br/>&gt; the invention of the harmonic minor scale. And they do love those<br/>&gt; melodic minor melodies. So you could write music in a Mixolydian tonic<br/>&gt; and still throw a V7 chord in there if you want. That&apos;s what they do<br/>&gt; with minor as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>All this is done often, yes.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve heard plenty of songs in which the I chord<br/>&gt; seems to be a &quot;stable&quot; sounding dominant 7 chord. I7. No need for it<br/>&gt; to be viewed as a V7/IV. Sometimes it has to do with the I7<br/>&gt; approximating an otonal tetrad, I think, but even when the 7th is<br/>&gt; tuned 9/5, it still can work as a root chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, I7 is quite normal in blues, rock&apos;n&apos;roll, jazz...<br/>&gt; The &quot;functional and modal&quot; paradigm that I&apos;ve been describing is<br/>&gt; historically younger than both the renaissance modal attitude and the<br/>&gt; common-practice attitude, and is currently &quot;winning&quot; and still in<br/>&gt; formation. It&apos;s, as you said, an ex poste attempt to describe the last<br/>&gt; hundred years of music (except for some of the 12-tone stuff, which I<br/>&gt; hate anyway). No, it isn&apos;t as well established as common practice<br/>&gt; theory, but it is what they teach in most jazz schools, and I find the<br/>&gt; paradigm superior for analyzing all kinds of music, even common<br/>&gt; practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>I would be last one who wouldn&apos;t agree with this, I compose this way since I&apos;ve started to make music.</p><p>Using it for analysis of historical modal or functional music is possible, but a-historical from musicological point of view. Almost same like if somebody will try to analyze Bach&apos;s or Mozart&apos;s works from the point of dodecaphony. Despite finding many unusual chromatic melodic motifs and harmonies we can&apos;t say they were dodecaphonists.<br/>&gt; What would you call it?<br/>&gt;<br/>Something like extended or free tonality, or modality (in modern sense).<br/>&gt; Whatever you would call it, that&apos;s the<br/>&gt; direction I see most modern music going into. Debussy, Ravel, film<br/>&gt; scores, electronic music, the Beatles, post-bop... They all used modes<br/>&gt; as various forms of tonic, or borrowed chords from different modes,<br/>&gt; but they definitely use modes differently than Renaissance music or<br/>&gt; Gregorian chant did. What it seemed like they were doing to me was<br/>&gt; extending the concept of a &quot;tonality&quot; to other modes besides major and<br/>&gt; minor.

Everything can work well. I tried everything in my works what you describe and much more, and didn&apos;t need a theoretical confirmation or permission for it.<br/>Extended tonality is only  one of styles or streams in 20th century music, not the main one.<br/>&gt; If functional harmony can&apos;t exist for the modes, what does &quot;modal<br/>&gt; harmony&quot; entail? Random chord clusters played over a drone? A<br/>&gt; pandiatonic wash of notes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>Such combination is possible, but then it is not modal harmony in historical sense.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2009 8:39:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think people are arguing over terminology, but the notion that the<br/>&gt; only modes with functional harmony are major/minor is an antiquated<br/>&gt; common practice idea that generally irritates me when it&apos;s taught as<br/>&gt; some inherent truth of the universe.
