Annis, who writes the<br/>following:</p><p>&gt;        Under the influence of your web page on 13th century<br/>&gt; polyphony, I have started to catalog the harmonic resources of any<br/>&gt; new tuning I use into four categories: consonant, moderately<br/>&gt; consonant, dissonant and moderately dissonant.</p><p>Here I might comment that while 13th-century Western European music is<br/>one fine example of these grades of concord/discord, there are various<br/>styles where it can nicely apply. Ludmila Ulehla, _Contemporary<br/>Harmony_, has a very interesting discussion on &quot;The Control of<br/>Dissonance&quot; where the section on 20th-century music might be of<br/>special interest. Of course, as you note, you might have a few things<br/>to add about how different interval ratios might rate in your own<br/>scheme.</p><p>It&apos;s a pleasure to see history serving as a catalyst for people to<br/>explore various possible approaches to concord/discord.</p><p>&gt; I am quite new to JI and I&apos;m surprised to find how I&apos;m categorizing<br/>&gt; intervals..  For example, in dissonant and moderately dissonant.  I<br/>&gt; am quite new to JI and I&apos;m surprised to find how I&apos;m categorizing<br/>&gt; intervals.  For example, in many timbres I consider the septimal or<br/>&gt; subminor third (7/6) *more* consonant than the minor third (6/5).<br/>&gt; Even more strangely, the ditone (81/64) doesn&apos;t bug me too much.</p><p>As to 7:6, or its close approximations in systems such as extended<br/>Pythagorean or meantone, opinions can vary, but I&apos;ve heard your view.<br/>In 1555, Vicentino says that the ~7:6 on his archicembalo (a diesis<br/>narrower than a usual minor third) seems to &quot;resemble a second,&quot; and<br/>therefore lean toward dissonance, in comparison with his ~11:9, which<br/>he considers an acceptable concord. However, I find that at least in<br/>some timbres, the 7:6 sounds considerably more concordant.</p><p>Interestingly, even for conventional composed music of the 18th<br/>century which would generally be considered 5-limit, tuning theorists<br/>such as Owen Jorgensen suggest that 7:6 is an acceptable concord, so<br/>that he would accept a very narrow minor third, although he would<br/>consider an equally wide major sixth approaching 12:7, say, as a<br/>&quot;Wolf&quot; (not a &quot;playable&quot; substitute for a normal major sixth) in the<br/>same music.</p><p>As to the 81:64, I would say that it is a regular major third in a<br/>medieval setting, a _relatively_ concordant interval. It can &quot;bug&quot;<br/>people if they expect something close to a 5:4, as would be true in<br/>16th-century music, assuming that the fifth partial is prominent in<br/>the timbre of the lower note. I&apos;ve found that in music where the 81:64<br/>is the norm, a 5:4 (or the Pythagorean diminished fourth, 8192:6561,<br/>very close) can actually sound &quot;strange,&quot; maybe a bit like a 7:4 or<br/>7:6 in music where it&apos;s not expected.</p><p>&gt;        I&apos;m no longer too concerned about quantitative solutions to<br/>&gt; the question of consonance.  I find W. Sethares&apos;s dissonance curves<br/>&gt; cover my own perception sufficiently.</p><p>Just to clarify my original meaning: I was thinking of ways to<br/>evaluate the &quot;fit&quot; of a tuning such as an equal temperament<br/>(e.g. 22-tet or 53-tet) to an ideal intonation system such as<br/>Pythagorean. I was wondering if one might invite some mathematical<br/>measure of &quot;fit,&quot; for example, which would recognize that 53-tet has<br/>excellent equivalents not only for the stable 3:2 and 4:3 of medieval<br/>polyphony, for example, but for the mildly unstable 81:64.</p><p>I warmly agree that William Sethares has made a very great<br/>contribution to this area, including the immediate qualification I&apos;d<br/>attach to the last paragraph: any &quot;rating&quot; of the numbers in the<br/>abstract might be modified by the actual timbres involved in a<br/>specific realization of the scale.</p><p>&gt;        I have to say, making those initial steps in JI, especially<br/>&gt; harmonicly, can be quite a large step.  I managed to join the JI<br/>&gt; Network, buy a few books and join this list before putting down the<br/>&gt; first note outside 12tet.  My own predisposition to contrapuntal<br/>&gt; textures has not made this process any easier, either.</p><p>Interestingly, much medieval music based on Pythagorean JI, and also<br/>Renaissance music based on 5-limit JI (or meantone, a useful<br/>approximation for keyboards), would be described as strongly<br/>&quot;contrapuntal&quot; in the sense of having individualized and often<br/>rhythmically quite independent voices. In fact, with forms such as<br/>13th-14th century motets, many of the polyphonic songs of Guillaume de<br/>Machaut (c. 1300-1377), and the technique of the _Ars subtilior_ at<br/>the end of the 14th century, this horizontal diversity has sometimes<br/>received so much (quite deserved) attention that the beauties of the<br/>vertical dimension may be underemphasized.</p><p>You could also consider the polyphony of Ockeghem in the 15th century,<br/>although here the treatment of concord/discord is a bit more<br/>restrained (the Renaissance is probably the most &quot;smooth&quot; or<br/>homogenous era of Western European composition when it comes to the<br/>approach to concord/discord).</p><p>In the 20th century, both a vertical interest in new approaches to<br/>concord/discord and a taste for melodic independence in counterpoint<br/>have contributed to the kind of developments which Ludmila Ulehla<br/>discusses.</p><p>Anyway, I would say that by taking a contrapuntal approach, you are<br/>following a very nice historical tradition.</p><p>&gt;         I&apos;ve been keeping a lot of notes of my explorations, in<br/>&gt; additions to pages of manuscript exploring the functional<br/>&gt; implications of various sorts of interval progressions.  Perhaps<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll turn some of that into a web page and see if the processes I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; employed are at all useful to other beginners.</p><p>This could be a very interesting resource, and I&apos;d much encourage you<br/>to experiment with various intervals and tunings and reach your own<br/>conclusions.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
