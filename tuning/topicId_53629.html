They both sound<br/>&gt; very similar.  Is Rhythm changes the name of the tune?  Sounds<br/>&gt; like &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;.<br/>&gt;  Carl,</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean to send two files.  Can ignore crhythm1.mid.  (sorry!)</p><p>The chord progression is commonly known as &quot;Rhythm Changes.&quot;  This file is a vocal exercise, actually.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to get in touch with John deLaubenfels.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Susan</p></div>
