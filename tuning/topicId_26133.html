I can see the problem of some systems in music<br/>which modulates a lot. Mine doesn&apos;t modulate much and I&apos;m fond of<br/>lingering around very few tonal centres. This might help in choosing. I<br/>keep forgetting how much easier it is to analyse temperaments by using<br/>lattices, so thanks to David for such a clear run through the analytical<br/>method.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div>
