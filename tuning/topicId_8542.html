It is many times older than 12-tET keyboards, older even<br/>than keyboards in general.</p><p>&gt;In keyboard terms, both &quot;augmented fourth&quot;<br/>&gt;and &quot;diminished fifth&quot; are (uuuuuughhhhhhgggggg!!!!!!!) &quot;tritones.&quot;</p><p>That was _not_ true in keyboard terms, until the establishment of a 12-tET<br/>standard around 1850. Strictly speaking, an augmented fourth is three major<br/>seconds, and a diminished fifth is two major seconds and two minor seconds.<br/>Two minor seconds make a diminished third. Only in 12-tET (or<br/>well-temperament) is a diminished third the same thing as a major second.</p><p>&gt;Keyboard<br/>&gt;tritones are invertible.

My point here is only that<br/>string<br/>&gt;&gt; players are not as likely to be influenced by keyboards as are singers.<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s _all. The question of the &quot;high third&quot; is relevant here (as far as<br/>I<br/>&gt;&gt; know).</p><p>&gt;I meant &quot;is irrelevant here (as far as I know).&quot;</p><p>&gt;Sorry I missed it. I hope it wasn&apos;t a problem.</p><p>I figured that that&apos;s what you meant. Needless to say, I disagree, and you<br/>can read the letters and comments of European musicians showing that in the<br/>1720s, any sort of &quot;high third&quot; (especially one larger than 400&#xFFFD;) was heard<br/>as quite abhorrent, while by the 1750s, due to the influence of the new<br/>temperaments coming on the scene, such thirds were becoming more and more<br/>acceptable.</p><p>&gt;Paul, I think your reasoning here is a bit suspect. If my hundreds of<br/>&gt;students were relying on a memory of 12-tET, why do they tune the third<br/>&gt;below piano pitch before the fifth is sounded, and why do they consistently<br/>&gt;move it above piano pitch while the fifth is sounding? Granted my &quot;demo&quot;<br/>had<br/>&gt;problems, but it did show a narrower third (albeit nearly at the piano<br/>pitch<br/>&gt;because of the basses sharp root) near the beginning of the example and a<br/>&gt;larger third near the end. To my ear, neither of these thirds were 12-tET.</p><p>As you know, I do believe the 4:5 &quot;low third&quot; is a powerful acoustical<br/>magnet that any sensitive singers would be drawn toward. I&apos;m not sure that<br/>the third at the end was larger than a 12-tET third -- yes, the upper note<br/>was higher than the piano pitch, but I think the bass was higher than the<br/>corresponding piano pitch by an even larger amount, with all these<br/>deviations being unstable, uncertain, and particularly confused by the<br/>addition of the poorly intonated fifth and the distracting piano tones.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I certainly don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; hear an acoustical &quot;locking&quot; occuring at two distinct values for the<br/>major<br/>&gt;&gt; third in this example.</p><p>&gt;Do you mean you don&apos;t hear _any locking? Or do you mean the &quot;two&quot; thirds<br/>are<br/>&gt;not different? As you would know, your answer to these questions is<br/>&gt;important. If the two thirds sound the same to you, it means we are hearing<br/>&gt;differently.</p><p>What I really don&apos;t hear is a major third that locks initially, expands<br/>through an unstable range, and finally locks again at a different, yet<br/>stable, value. If this phenomenon does in fact occur with better singers, I<br/>gave you my possible explanation (involving 1/24:1/19:1/16) some time ago.<br/>Certainly there are no simpler numbers that would be compatible with the<br/>phenomenon, given your reaction to the chords with sharper major thirds in<br/>Joe Monzo&apos;s file. Numbers like 19 are so high, though, that I feel that even<br/>if this explanation is correct, it is an artifact of trying to achieve an<br/>approximation of 12-tET through acoustical means.</p><p>Here is a complete list of ratios using numbers up to 50 that represent<br/>intervals between 5:4 and 14:11 (which you though was too high to be the<br/>high third):</p><p>  386.3137&#xFFFD;    5:4<br/>  395.1692&#xFFFD;   49:39<br/>  396.1783&#xFFFD;   44:35<br/>  397.4471&#xFFFD;   39:31<br/>  399.0904&#xFFFD;   34:27<br/>  401.3028&#xFFFD;   29:23<br/>  404.4420&#xFFFD;   24:19<br/>  406.5623&#xFFFD;   43:34<br/>  409.2443&#xFFFD;   19:15<br/>  412.7453&#xFFFD;   33:26<br/>  414.1626&#xFFFD;   47:37<br/>  417.5080&#xFFFD;   14:11</p><p>Jerry wrote,</p><p>&gt;Tonal music, in general, seems universal and probably predates God (at<br/>least<br/>&gt;man&apos;s concept of him/her). At the change of the millennium, polyphony was<br/>&gt;introduced in Western music, however it was still largely vocal,<br/>&gt;particularly in the altus and superius voices, each tuning to the sustained<br/>&gt;tenor.</p><p>At that time, and for several centuries thereafter, there were no consonant<br/>triads, no hint of major and minor modes, hence none of the elements that<br/>constitute &quot;tonal music&quot; in the sense it has in the title of Forte&apos;s book,<br/>and the sense that is relevant to our discussions here, all of which are<br/>framed in the context of this particular tonal system.</p><p>As for universality, I suggest a bit of ethnomusicology for you. A recent<br/>PBS special would have been great. No hint of Western scales or tunings, let<br/>alone &quot;tonal music&quot;, in most of these cultures.</p><p>&gt;I didn&apos;t mean that I think historical musicians were unaware of tuning<br/>&gt;issues. I simply think that there would have been many, like many musicians<br/>&gt;today, who understood the theory and then did what they &quot;heard.&quot; I have<br/>&gt;observed, in many arenas of life, that what people _think they do is not<br/>&gt;always _what they do.</p><p>What I was talking about was musicians who were using their ears, their<br/>knowledge of what the music that _they_ made sounded like, apart from any<br/>theory. Their own reactions to various tunings were as valid to them as your<br/>reactions are to you. Like you, they made music in the way that sounded most<br/>natural to them, and heard various proposed tunings relative to that. What<br/>is fascinating is the conviction with which one set of norms felt &quot;natural&quot;<br/>to a set of musicians in one period, a different set of norms being<br/>&quot;natural&quot; in another period, and occasionally the _same_ musician will<br/>express a _different_ opinion of what sounds best early vs. late in their<br/>life (if they lived in a transitional period).</p><p>Before continuing to dismiss the importance of keyboards, read Daniel Wolf&apos;s<br/>recent post and Margo Schulter&apos;s upcoming one. But there is one important<br/>point you may be missing. Whether keyboards were present or not, the _music_<br/>is what was changing. The very style of the music went hand in hand with the<br/>tuning used. What musicians were feeling in the eighteenth century (and at<br/>many other points in time) was not simply a brainwashing due to abstract<br/>mathematical theories of how keyboards should be tuned. It was a revolution<br/>in musical expression, an &quot;out with the old and in with the new&quot; kind of<br/>mentality in which a collective cultural shift was being sensed and<br/>participated in by a generation of musicians. As keyboards were the primary<br/>tool with which composers brought these changes about, yes, we did get stuck<br/>with some tuning ideas a bit biased toward a fixed-pitch paradigm. But<br/>without the keyboard, the aesthetic movement may never have found as full a<br/>means of being realized. The _mutually interacting_ and synergistic<br/>influences of the changes in keyboard tuning and the changes in musical<br/>style were strong enough to alter musicians&apos; _aural_ conception of what was<br/>natural and what wasn&apos;t.</p><p>Now I&apos;ll go back to your reaction to the I-IV-V7-I files.</p><p>&gt;The mystery is why did six out of his eight<br/>&gt;files open nicely in QuickTime, while the two others only opened a blank IE<br/>&gt;window that would not go anywhere. The techie did not know about the IE<br/>&gt;browser reaction, but I didn&apos;t think it was worth the time to wait another<br/>&gt;hour and a half to find out what Microsoft had to say about it.</p><p>I do hope you&apos;re able to listen to all eight files soon. Perhaps at someone<br/>else&apos;s PC?</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll now give you the lowdown on the files you listened to.</p><p>&gt;1. keenan. mid - harmless and familiar, a nice even control of dissonance<br/>&gt;but not &quot;in tune.&quot; The thirds are all a bit low</p><p>The thirds are all exactly 5:4 above the roots.</p><p>&gt;and the roots in IV (I<br/>&gt;think) and V are flat.</p><p>The root of the IV chord is 488.9&#xFFFD; above the tonic, but the root of the V<br/>chord is 711.1&#xFFFD; above the tonic, hence the root of the V would probably be<br/>considered sharp, not flat.</p><p>&gt;2. 71-64-81.mid - I and IV generally agreeable, V7 like a french accordian.<br/>&gt;(That means: @^*#_*^%$)</p><p>The V7 chord here has a low seventh (969&#xFFFD;=7:4) and a high third<br/>(408&#xFFFD;=Pythagorean). Evidently this does not satisfy you as the dominant<br/>chord with high third and low seventh.</p><p>&gt;3. 7I.mid - fantastic, lovely, wonderful, A+, ideal, real nice. :-)</p><p>The &quot;:-)&quot; indicates that you might be joking, but assuming you&apos;re not, this<br/>is the version that has pure 4:5:6 triads, 4:5:6:7 dominant seventh, and the<br/>roots related by perfect 2:3 or 3:4 ratios. Evidently the large shift in the<br/>tuning of the fourth scale degree does not bother you the way it _really_<br/>bothers me and some of the other people who have commented on this file. So<br/>unless you&apos;re joking, it appears that your theory is to some extent<br/>consistent with what you really like to hear.</p><p>&gt;4. 51-5-9.mid - a decent I and IV, the root (I think, or is it the seventh)<br/>&gt;obnoxiously sharp in the V7.</p><p>It&apos;s the seventh, which is 5:9 = 1018&#xFFFD; above the root.</p><p>&gt;5. pythag.mid - a flat third in both the I and IV, and a ridiculous V7<br/>&gt;chord.</p><p>The I and IV are pure 4:5:6 triads, and the V7 (and only the V7) is in<br/>Pythagorean tuning, with a 408&#xFFFD; major third and a 996&#xFFFD; minor seventh.</p><p>&gt;6. 1-4c-mt.mid - reasonable I and IV, a very flat leading tone in V7</p><p>1/4-comma meantone. Here the thirds are exactly 5:4 over the roots, but the<br/>fifths are about 697&#xFFFD;. The roots are related by these flat fifths (sharp<br/>fourths), which (combined with the 5:4 thirds) is why the leading tone<br/>sounds so flat (major seventh = 386 + 697 = 1083&#xFFFD;) relative to what you&apos;re<br/>used to. The dominant seventh here has a seventh that is 1007&#xFFFD; above the<br/>root -- surprisingly, no one seems to have been bothered by this.</p><p>Now I&apos;m _really_ curious as to how you would react to the other two files.<br/>So far, it&apos;s interesting how the 5:4 major thirds please you in some<br/>contexts but not in others.</p></div><h3><a id=9014 href="#9014">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

You know that beating is minimal only at<br/>simple-integer ratios, yet you&apos;ve come to the conclusion that the high third<br/>is not a simple-integer ratio. It would be great to set you up with an<br/>analog synth and have you tweak the dial until you get a &quot;locked&quot; high<br/>third. If you truly acheive it by eliminating beating at some frequency,<br/>we&apos;d be able to determine which simple-integer ratio corresponds to the high<br/>third (perhaps we&apos;d find several -- 1/24:1/19:1/16 seems the most likely<br/>candidate, though). On the other hand, if you were not actually eliminating<br/>beating, we&apos;d probably find a &quot;smear&quot; in your responses if we repeated the<br/>experiment many times.</p><p>Now, there is a phenomenon known as roughness which is distinct from (though<br/>always accompanied by relatively rapid) beating, which kicks in when<br/>sine-wave components are a certain interval from one another, depending on<br/>loudness and register. Though it wouldn&apos;t apply to the sine-wave example,<br/>since there are no harmonic component to beat against one another, for human<br/>voices the high third may be a result of trying to get the third as high as<br/>possible without suffering from deleterious roughness (just an idea).<br/>Someone with Sethares&apos; book might want to look at the roughness function and<br/>help figure out if this makes sense. To the best of my knowledge and<br/>experience this would often result in a major third around the ET and<br/>Pythagorean values.</p><p>&gt;Paul, does &quot;push one another apart&quot; mean &quot;widen the interval&quot;?</p><p>Yup!</p></div>
