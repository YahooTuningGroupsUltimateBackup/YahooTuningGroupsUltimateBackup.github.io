Update !!!</p><p>I have completed my John Bull &apos;Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La&apos; realization a couple of<br/>days ago....and am just now posting it. It&apos;s nice to be done with a project<br/>that I&apos;ve been delaying for months!</p><p>I left information from my original post a while back (when it was *almost*<br/>done) below for reference.</p><p>Here it is (complete version as a .ogg file):<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg</a></p><p>As an incomplete mp3 file:<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.mp3</a></p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m posting it complete only as an .ogg file. This is not to alienate<br/>listeners, lose audience, etc, but because I believe in maximal fidelity in<br/>sound for a compressed format, and I don&apos;t believe in sacrificing that to the<br/>degree that I can help it. It is clearer to me than ever after doing<br/>extensive comparisons and research over the last couple of days that .ogg<br/>files are superior to .mp3s, in spite of the arguments for the ubiquitousness<br/>of .mp3. Nevertheless, I give a sample of the last minute and a half or so of<br/>the realization as an mp3; hopefully, if any of you stalwart mp3 users are<br/>intrigued enough, you will join the revolution, and update your listening<br/>situation to include .ogg capability.</p><p>For those of you who missed the ogg/mp3 debate, I had a relevant post about<br/>directly comparing their implementation, at least at it occurs on the linux<br/>platform. I included a &apos;snippet.wav&apos; example, compressed to both mp3 and ogg,<br/>and the results speak for themselves.
