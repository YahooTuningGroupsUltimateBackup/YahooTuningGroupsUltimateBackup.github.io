The old Grove<br/>&gt;     says: &quot;Sorge<br/>&gt;     was unfortunately a very conceited man.&quot; Brad, if he did study with<br/>&gt;     Bach,<br/>&gt;     do you think he would admit it, being so conceited and all? Might we<br/>&gt;     say he<br/>&gt;     studied from J.S. Bach from a distance? : ) J</p><p>Well, Lindley also chided Sorge in print (in the _Oxford Composer Companion: Bach_) for having not ever tried smaller intervals than 1/12 PC in his temperaments.  Not surprisingly, some of Lindley&apos;s other articles do the same thing: asserting that Bach-style temperaments somehow must have used finer distinctions than Sorge and Neidhardt would ever do, smaller fragments of comma juggling than 1/12.  Since it would cross against Lindley&apos;s own hypothesis, Sorge&apos;s work as witness must have been incomplete in that way.  Hmm.</p><p>Anyway, don&apos;t you think that if Sorge *had* ever formally studied with Bach, he&apos;d probably be the first and loudest person to brag about to it anybody and everybody?  He asserted Bach&apos;s authority on several occasions, and lauded Bach&apos;s work and opinions to the utmost, but without saying he&apos;d ever studied with him.  Have you read the preface of Sorge&apos;s book of chorale preludes from 1750, and what he said about Bach in there?  A facsimile and translation are available on pages 113-115 of Christoph Wolff&apos;s book _Bach: Essays on his life and music_, if you&apos;re curious.  And I played Sorge&apos;s little setting of &quot;Vater unser in Himmelreich&quot; from that Wolff facsimile for my recording; an attractive piece, and it accomplishes Sorge&apos;s stated aims.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=75307 href="#75307">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/1/2008 7:55:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brad, you ask:</p><p>&quot;Anyway, don&apos;t you think that if Sorge *had* ever formally studied  with<br/>Bach, he&apos;d probably be the first and loudest person to brag about to  it<br/>anybody and everybody?&quot;</p><p>Me:  Not necessarily.  There are some complex  personalities.  Bach was<br/>singular in not accepting Johann Mattheson&apos;s  request for an autobiography, for<br/>example.  You and I would have.  I  don&apos;t believe anyone is listed as having been<br/>Sorge&apos;s teacher.  Kirnberger  had a year and a half with Bach, formerly, but<br/>he was sick the whole time.</p><p>Don&apos;t you have people that say they studied with you on their resumes, but<br/>who never took a formal lesson?
