Many persons<br/>never return, either through their inclination to permanently &quot;defect&quot; a<br/>la Gauguin, or a particular orientation that seems to affect those<br/>exposed to the place -- the inability to distinguish between their own<br/>computer screens and totemic deities...</p><p>In any case, ONE person did return, by the name of Brian Harlan.  He<br/>actually DID voyage to Anaphoria and he returned with his mind curiously<br/>intact...  He lived to write about it. You can read about his successful<br/>interview with Kraig Grady on the Harry Partch Corporeal Meadows<br/>website:</p><p><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/kgintrvu.html">http://www.corporeal.com/kgintrvu.html</a></p><p>But remember, he had a particular strength of mind and character to make<br/>it back &quot;through the looking glass!&quot;</p><p>In the meantime, please visit the Erv Wilson archive on the Website... a<br/>reasonable substitute for a virtual trip there...  I&apos;m &quot;stuck&quot; in the<br/>archive at the moment. (Ahem...)<br/>____________ ______ ____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
