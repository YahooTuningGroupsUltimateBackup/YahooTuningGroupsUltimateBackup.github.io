It is magical how JI transcription happened to<br/>&quot;work&quot; on this one. It would be nice to see a post on your thought<br/>processes on figuring out the common-tones, etc. This type of<br/>transcription, with 11 and 13 and 19 identities, leads to a pronounced<br/>&quot;periodicity buzz&quot; in the otonalities that is radically different from<br/>the jazz aesthetic but has a flavor that can certainly grow on you (Kami<br/>Rousseau had some similar transcriptions on his web page, Kami, are you<br/>still with us?)</p><p>Also, the progression from the 126/95-Otonality to the 9/5-Otonality is<br/>quite nice as a V-I, even though the root rises by a fourth of 529 cents<br/>(or drops by a fifth of 671 cents). This underscores what I was saying<br/>to Dan Stearns, that a fourth of 533 cents can be acceptable<br/>melodically, and that applies at least as well when the &quot;melody&quot; is a<br/>bassline.</p><p>At 2am, it really is nicer to hear music than to look at theories! Joe,<br/>can you help me MIDI-ize a 22-tET piece of mine (the one I keep talking<br/>about), and maybe we can create a JI rendition too? Peter Blasser, if<br/>you&apos;re there, I successfully got csound as you directed, but couldn&apos;t<br/>get Rocky to work. My home e-mail doesn&apos;t seem to be working, so can you<br/>reply to me here? Thanks!</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
