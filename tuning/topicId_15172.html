The actual lattice resides in 4-dimensional space, as<br/>Dave and I have been trying to depict in various ways. What Dave did here<br/>was a topological transformation (like the one that makes a donut out of a<br/>coffee cup) of the 4-D dekany into 2-D space, distorting positions and<br/>directions, but preserving all the connections betweeen points so that one<br/>can more easily see them.</p><p>As another example, I can make a graph of the hexany as follows:</p><p> C*D---------------------B*D<br/>  |\&grave;--.__         __,--&apos;/|<br/>  | \     &grave;--A*D--&apos;     / |<br/>  \  \       / \       /  /<br/>   \  \     /   \     /  /<br/>   |   \   /     \   /   |<br/>   |    \ /       \ /    |<br/>   \    A*C-------A*B    /<br/>    \     \       /     /<br/>     \_    \     /    _/<br/>       \    \   /    /<br/>        \_   \ /   _/<br/>          &grave;--C*B--&apos;</p><p>which you can imagine as the result of stretching out an octahedron and<br/>flattening it out onto a flat surface.</p><p>Again, it&apos;s not a lattice, it&apos;s a graph.
