In some<br/>ways our approaches may be quite different, and in some ways very<br/>similar. For example, we seem to share the concept of 24-tET as two<br/>12-tET scales a quartertone apart.</p><p>In discussing some specifics, as you have requested, I would like to<br/>emphasize that my own favorite progressions are only one set of<br/>possibilities, and you know this well, since you have found some<br/>equally impressive musical possibilities along some of the many other<br/>lines.</p><p>Also, please let me apologize for any errors in either this article or<br/>the MIDI examples below. May I mention, especially for people reading<br/>this on the World Wide Web, that my examples of 24-tET musical<br/>notation call for a monospaced or typewriter-like font?</p><p>As you comment, one of the main questions in using 24-tET is how to<br/>combine notes from our two 12-tET scales or &quot;keys,&quot; whether to seek<br/>dramatic dissonance or pleasant consonance of various kinds.</p><p>To show the notes of the scale, I will borrow a notation from the<br/>composer Nicola Vicentino, which he used in the 16th century, although<br/>for a somewhat different kind of tuning. Here I will use an asterisk<br/>sign or * to show a note raised by a quartertone, or 50 cents. In<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 31-note meantone tuning, this same shows a note raised by<br/>about a fifth of a tone, somewhere around 35-41 cents, so the sign may<br/>not be too much out of place in 24-tET, although the musical style is<br/>very different.</p><p>This kind of notation especially fits the kind of instrument I use, a<br/>synthesizer with two 12-note keyboards, here tuned a quartertone<br/>apart. The * sign tells us to play a note on the upper keyboard:</p><p>      150      350           650      850      1050<br/>       C#*      Eb*           F#*      G#*      Bb*<br/>   C*       D*       E*   F*       G*       A*       B*   C*<br/>   0       250      450  550      750      950      1150 1250<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>      100      300           600      800      1000<br/>       C#       Eb            F#       G#       Bb<br/>   C        D        E    F        G        A        B    C<br/>   0       200      400  500      700      900      1100 1200</p><p>Because many people are accustomed to diagrams based on an octave of<br/>C-C, I have used this octave, with numbers showing intervals in cents<br/>in terms of C.</p><p>My own favorite way of seeking beauty in 24-tET involves certain<br/>progressions moving from more complex or tense intervals to more<br/>simple or blending ones.</p><p>Let us first try some of these progressions in 12-tET, and then<br/>explore some of the beautiful new versions that 24-tET offers.</p><p>In this kind of style, our basic concords are unisons, octaves,<br/>fifths, and fourths. Other intervals are active or unstable, seeking<br/>to resolve to our stable intervals.</p><p>More specifically, major thirds often expand to fifths, and major<br/>sixths to octaves. Major seconds may expand to fourths. Minor thirds<br/>often contract to unisons, and minor sevenths to fifths.</p><p>Here are a couple of three-voice progressions showing some of these<br/>resolutions in basic 12-tET. Here I will a notation like that of MIDI,<br/>with C4 as middle C, and with links to MIDI files for each of the<br/>examples:</p><p>    E4  F4          E4  F4          F4   E4        C#4   D4<br/>    B3  C4          D4  C4          Bb3  A3        A3    G3<br/>    G3  F3          G3  F3          G3   A3        F#3   G3</p><p> (M6-8 + M3-5)   (M6-8 + M2-4)   (m7-5 + m3-1)   (m3-1 + M3-5)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet001.mid</a>&gt;<br/>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet002.mid</a>&gt;<br/>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet003.mid</a>&gt;<br/>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/12tet004.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Below each example I have shown in parentheses which of our two-voice<br/>resolutions are involved in a given progression. A general pattern is<br/>that major intervals (seconds, thirds, sixths) often tend to expand,<br/>while minor intervals (especially thirds and sevenths) tend to<br/>contract.</p><p>You may notice that in these 12-tET progressions, there is a common<br/>pattern. in any of the two-voice resolutions I show above, one voice<br/>moves by a whole-tone of 200 cents, and the other by a semitone of 100<br/>cents.</p><p>To find new and beautiful versions of these same progressions in<br/>24-tET using the notes of both keyboards, we can imagine that the<br/>minor intervals such as thirds and sevenths want to be yet smaller, so<br/>as more easily to reach stable unisons and fifths.</p><p>Major thirds and sixths, in contrast, want to be yet larger, so as to<br/>be closer to the fifths and octaves to which they would like to<br/>expand.</p><p>Let us see, and hear, what happens, when we let the minor intervals<br/>grow smaller, and the major intervals larger. First we will try two<br/>progressions with expanding major intervals:</p><p>    E*4  F4<br/>    B*3  C4<br/>    G3   F3</p><p> (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here the usual major third G3-B3 at 400 cents has grown by a<br/>quartertone to a large major third G3-B*3 at 450 cents, and the usual<br/>major sixth G3-E4 to the larger G3-E*4 at 950 cents. I find these<br/>intervals beautiful, and cosmic.</p><p>Since these intervals are larger, they have less far to expand in<br/>order to reach the fifth F3-C4 and the octave F3-F4. Instead of usual<br/>12-tET semitones of 100 cents, we can use small 24-tET semitones, or<br/>actually quartertones, of 50 cents for the resolutions of the two<br/>upper voices: B*3-C4 and E*4-F4.</p><p>Here is a new 24-tET version of a similar cadence, with the same<br/>larger major sixth G3-E*4 at 950 cents, plus a large major second or<br/>whole-tone of 250 cents between the upper voices, D4-E*4:</p><p>    E*4  F4<br/>    D4   C4<br/>    G3   F3</p><p> (M6-8 + M2-4)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>The lower two voices descend by usual 200-cent whole-tones, just as in<br/>12-tET, but the highest voice again need move only a small 50-cent<br/>step in order to complete the resolution.</p><p>Now it is time to discover one of the special surprises which 24-tET<br/>shares with 29-tET also. Let us consider another resolution of exactly<br/>the same unstable sonority we used in the last example, G3-D4-E*4:</p><p>    E*4  E4<br/>    D4   E4<br/>    G3   A3</p><p> (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet003.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>While in the last example we treated the interval G3-E*4, or 950<br/>cents, as a large major sixth seeking the octave, we can equally well<br/>consider it as a small minor seventh seeking to contract to a fifth,<br/>as happens here!</p><p>Similarly, we can consider the interval of 250 cents between the two<br/>upper voices, D4-E*4, as either a very large major second often<br/>expanding to a fourth, or, as here, a very small minor third seeking<br/>to contract to a unison.</p><p>Although we need only one special sign, here the * symbol, to name all<br/>24 notes, we might want sometimes to use another sign as well, in<br/>order to show the different musical meanings of the note E*4 in these<br/>two examples. If we use the sign &quot;d&quot; to show a note _lowered_ by a<br/>quartertone, then we can also write the second progression like this:</p><p>    Fd4  E4<br/>    D4   E4<br/>    G3   A3</p><p> (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet003.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>This notation tells us that G3-D4-Fd4 is here thought of as having a<br/>small minor seventh G3-Fd4 and a small minor third D4-Fd4, as the<br/>spellings suggest. Also, the &quot;d&quot; sign -- rather like the usual flat<br/>sign -- may suggest that the note Fd4 might seek a resolution by<br/>descending motion, as happens here (Fd4-E4).</p><p>In contrast, in this kind of notation with both * and d, the spelling<br/>G3-D4-E*4 suggests that E*4 may move upward, as it does here (E*4-F4).<br/>In this way, * is a bit like the usual sharp sign.</p><p>For 24-tET progressions of this kind, a useful general pattern is that<br/>each voice moves either by a usual whole-tone of 200 cents (as in<br/>12-tET), or by a small step of 50 cents. Here are two more examples<br/>involving small minor thirds and sevenths, showing two resolutions for<br/>the same unstable sonority. For each example, I will give two<br/>notations: a simple notation using only the * sign; or the notation<br/>with the &quot;d&quot; sign as well:</p><p>    E*4  E4                    Fd4    E4<br/>    A*3  A4                    Bbd3   A3<br/>    G3   A3          or        G3     A3</p><p> (m7-5 + m3-1)               (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet004.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>    E*4  D*3                   Fd3    Ebd3<br/>    A*3  G*3                   Bbd3   Abd3<br/>    G3   G*3         or        G3     Abd3</p><p>  (m7-5 + m3-1)               (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet005.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet005.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>To this point, we have considered three-voice progressions. Maybe a<br/>good place to conclude this article would by sharing a couple of<br/>four-voice progressions, and adding a few words of friendship.</p><p>First, here is a 24-tET progression mostly with expanding intervals:<br/>large major seconds, thirds, and sixths:</p><p>         E*4   F4<br/>         D4    C4<br/>         B*3   C4<br/>         G3    F3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet006.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet006.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here is a progression with mostly contracting intervals, small minor<br/>thirds and sevenths, given in both methods of spelling:</p><p>         E*4   D*4                               Fd4   Ebd4<br/>         D4    D*4                               D4    Ebd4<br/>         A*3   G*3                               Bbd3  Abd3<br/>         G3    G*3                or             G3    Abd3</p><p>(m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)              (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet007.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/24tet007.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>                          -     -     -</p><p>Now for a few final comments. Timbre can be very important in shaping<br/>perceptions of consonance and dissonance, and a gentle timbre can be<br/>very helpful in making intervals such as large major thirds sound at<br/>once new and pleasant. This can make the choice of instruments for a<br/>piece, or of the timbres used on a synthesizer, very important.</p><p>From my perspective, 24-tET like 12-tET is a kind of variation on<br/>Pythagorean tuning with a chain of pure fifths: fifths and fourths are<br/>almost pure concords, while the usual thirds and sixths are rather<br/>active, but a bit more &quot;subdued&quot; than in Pythagorean.</p><p>In 24-tET, these intervals are free to take on what I might call<br/>almost an &quot;ultramodern&quot; quality, getting larger or smaller by a full<br/>quartertone or 50 cents. At the same time, our nearly pure fifths and<br/>fourths provide a welcome &quot;home&quot; or destination for these active<br/>intervals, so that they can resolve in a very satisfying way.</p><p>What I have tried to do here is only to give examples of a few musical<br/>patterns in 24-tET in one kind of style. Of course I would welcome any<br/>questions and comments, and warmly invite you to use anything here in<br/>your own music if it seems to fit. You might find yourself mixing<br/>these progressions with more dissonant passages, or changing the<br/>progressions to fit your own style.</p><p>Please understand that 24-tET is something of an &quot;unusual&quot; tuning for<br/>me: I am much more familiar for this kind of style with Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and with temperaments where fifths are larger than pure, such<br/>as 29-tET.</p><p>The basic progressions I have described are common in 13th-14th century<br/>Western European music, and I have heard similar things in Georgian<br/>and Gurian music, although the rules may be a bit different, and<br/>certainly each culture has its own traditions.</p><p>By the way, I have read that Georgian musicians were writing about<br/>three-voice music in the 12th century, a bit earlier than in Western<br/>Europe, so I tend to regard the Georgian tradition as in some ways an<br/>elder sister. I wonder whether it is possible in Russia to find<br/>recordings of traditional Georgian music; this is a heritage of many<br/>centuries, and Igor Stravinsky, as I recall, wrote of his admiration<br/>for it.</p><p>While polyphony based on stable fifths and fourths is common in many<br/>world cultures, I tend to regard 24-tET as rather &quot;new&quot; and &quot;modern.&quot;<br/>The meeting of the old and the new is maybe a theme in much of my<br/>music, and when playing in 24-tET I sometimes seem to be in kind of<br/>dialogue with the 20th century.</p><p>In friendship,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
