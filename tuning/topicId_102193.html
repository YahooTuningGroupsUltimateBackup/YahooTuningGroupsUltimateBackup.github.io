For example, you go onto express how<br/>the prime factorization of a JI interval can lead to its<br/>characterization as a point in a vector space - what we call &quot;interval<br/>space.&quot; You use the notation [-4, 4, -1] for the syntonic comma, and<br/>we&apos;ve been doing the same sort of thing here as well - we typically<br/>notate it in a &quot;ket&quot; as |-4 4 -1&gt;, and call such things &quot;monzos,&quot;<br/>after Joe Monzo who&apos;s a theorist that used to frequent this list.</p><p>So here&apos;s a question: if you&apos;re representing intervals as a point in a<br/>vector space (let&apos;s call it V), have you ever looked at the space of<br/>all linear functionals on V - that is, the space V* which is the dual<br/>space of V? For example, consider the covector &lt;12 19 28|, written in<br/>a &quot;bra&quot; to denote that it is in fact a covector, and then what it<br/>might mean when you apply this covector to elements in interval space.<br/>(Covectors acting on vectors in interval space are often called &quot;vals&quot;<br/>around here).</p><p>Also, as a last note, many of the things you wrote about intervallic<br/>&quot;mood&quot; are very interesting, but I admit that lately I&apos;ve come to<br/>believe that there is a potent source of musical emotion, mood, or<br/>general feeling which is intonation-independent and isn&apos;t quite fully<br/>understood. Consider these listening examples here, which are Bach<br/>retunings:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-categorical-experiments/">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-categorical-experiments/</a></p><p>While it&apos;s definitely true that the more harmonically accurate tunings<br/>differ considerably in &quot;mood&quot; from the less accurate ones, it also<br/>seems to be true that there is something that a &quot;major third&quot; is which<br/>is independent of whether it&apos;s intoned as 5/4 (as is the case in<br/>31-EDO) or 9/7 (as is the case in 22-EDO), so long as the scalar<br/>structure is reasonably in place. So I&apos;d encourage you to think about<br/>what some of that might mean.</p><p>Anyway, aside from that, there&apos;s still obviously something important<br/>about just ratios, and a remarkable amount of mileage to be cranked<br/>out of just the notion of putting them into a vector space. You might<br/>also want to consider the yahoo &quot;tuning-math&quot; group, where a lot of<br/>research in this area continues to take place, as well as the<br/>Xenharmonic Alliance group which Gene just linked you to.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sat, Dec 31, 2011 at 9:17 AM, jarlmosand &lt;jarlmos@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have for many years (probably like 25) been thinking about the relation between harmony and maths.

Would like to comment<br/>on the miner third.    I have seen a few sources written, in the 1800&rsquo;s, of<br/>the in inverted theory based on the inverted harmonic series.   How ever<br/>none of then came up with the Fmin chord as your have from the Cmin, as I<br/>recall [40 years ago].</p><p>The problem with this theory is that it dose not fit the theory of how we<br/>hear, as far as I know.   Another is that the Fmin chord in the key of Cmin<br/>would not function as a tonic.    And if it was the real tonic then you<br/>could not end a peace with a Cmaj chord as is sometimes done.</p><p>The root of the chord usually sets the function of the chord [tonic,<br/>dominant, or subdominant] and the third sets the quality [maj or min] of<br/>the chord.</p><p>Another way to look at the minor chord is say that the miner third is a<br/>mistuned major third.   Reference Paul Hindemith, The Craft Of Musical<br/>Composition.</p><p>The way I see it, is to look at the chord as three separate intervals.   The<br/>main one is the fifth 2:3, and the thirds, which set the quality, 4:5 and<br/>5:6.   If the notes fall in the upper part of one harmonic series, then the<br/>intervals are most blinding.   If the thirds do not fall in the same<br/>harmonic series the root and the fifth do, then is not as blinding.</p><p>What i have read has been interesting, I will read more of you paper.<br/>&fnof;g</p><p>On Sat, Dec 31, 2011 at 9:17 AM, jarlmosand &lt;jarlmos@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have for many years (probably like 25) been thinking about the relation<br/>&gt; between harmony and maths.
