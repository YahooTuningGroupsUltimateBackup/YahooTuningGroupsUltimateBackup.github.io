But i could be wrong</p><p>The top is high grade spruce and quite expensive so I don&apos;t really want to experiment on it. I&apos;d<br/>love to have the time and skill to make a curved top zither. Those Vietnamese and Korean kotos are<br/>so elegant. PVC sounds like a good idea for the future and I have some pipes large enough. I&apos;ll use<br/>cherry or mahogany for the bridges.</p><p>Regards</p></div>
