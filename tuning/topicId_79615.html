The point of maximum dissonance<br/>is at about 25% CB. Problem is, the width of the CB is not same over<br/>the entire aural spectrum. It&apos;s incredibly wide in low frequencies,<br/>meaning the interval of maximum dissonance can be an interval which is<br/>normally considered a consonance. At 16 Hz, MD is a fifth, at 33 Hz,<br/>it&apos;s a major third, at 50 Hz a minor third.

In the 20th century, Partch credits himself with 11-limit,<br/>and Kathleen Schlesinger with 13-limit. However, he also gives Ptolemy a<br/>nod for using 7 and 11, not just 5 and 9.</p><p>So if 11-limit is &quot;Partchian&quot;, can 7-limit be &quot;Mersennian&quot; and 13-limit<br/>&quot;Schlesingerian&quot;?

Some years ago, I was thinking<br/>about &quot;enharmonic&quot; for 19 and something like &quot;diachromatic&quot; or<br/>similar for 31. But I&apos;m still not decided. The thing is that in 5-<br/>equal you temper out the diatonic step, in 7-equal you temper out the<br/>chromatic step, in 12-equal you temper out the enharmonic step, and<br/>in 19-equal you temper out this strange step which I was<br/>calling &quot;diachromatic&quot; at that time.</p><p>Well, in Woolhouse&apos;s book, a 19-equal scale is advocated, and he<br/>considers it an enharmonic scale, so on that you and he are in<br/>agreement.
