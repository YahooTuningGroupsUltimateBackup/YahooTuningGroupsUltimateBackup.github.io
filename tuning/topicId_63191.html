It&apos;s very<br/>uneven and no two steps are the same size.</p><p>It turns out that any n-EDO where n = q*(q+1)+1 and q is either prime<br/>or a whole-number power of a prime, has complete interval coverage<br/>from a scale with only q+1 notes. However, 31-EDO is the only such EDO<br/>of any great musical interest.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=63197 href="#63197">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2005 11:13:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It turns out that any n-EDO where n = q*(q+1)+1 and q is either prime<br/>&gt; or a whole-number power of a prime, has complete interval coverage<br/>&gt; from a scale with only q+1 notes.

Yes this would have been more appropriate for<br/>tuning-math. I see now that this very question was posed by Bob<br/>Valentine and answered by Kees van Prooijen, in April 2002.</p><p>I fully expected that _you_ would know the answer, Gene. But I&apos;m a<br/>little surprised that you didn&apos;t pick me up on my mistaken assertion<br/>that such a scale was unique (ignoring rotations and reversals). Kees<br/>found 5. One of them is a little more melodically-even than the one I<br/>was looking at.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=63211 href="#63211">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2005 5:00:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I fully expected that _you_ would know the answer, Gene.

In fact, these kinds<br/>of difference sets are sometimes called planar, as they lead to finite<br/>projective planes, and projective automorphisms will give you various<br/>scales. I had the impression you were saying that the scales are to be<br/>regarded as unique up to rotations and reversals. Anyway, the 31 case<br/>is the projective plane of order 5, which has 31 points but also 31<br/>lines; it&apos;s the lines we want.</p><p>If I&apos;m supposed to be correcting things, everyone believes that they<br/>all must be of the form n^2+n+1 with n a prime power, but that has not<br/>yet been proven. It is true for anything of conceivable musical use.</p></div>
