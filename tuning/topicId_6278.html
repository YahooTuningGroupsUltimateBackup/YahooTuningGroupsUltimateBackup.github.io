With a fair amount of bridge work and rescaling,<br/>though, they would be nice instruments - especially for recording. It also would<br/>be easier to truck the two around because of their size.</p><p>Any interest? They could even be black with BRAMBACH emblazoned in gold letters<br/>on the bentside.</p><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; ...Steinway specifically forbids quartertone tunings.</p><p>This sounds just like old S&amp;S - if they haven&apos;t patented it (or, as I discovered<br/>recently, _think_ they&apos;ve patented it) they&apos;ll forbid it.
