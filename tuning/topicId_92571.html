I can definitely get into blackjack,<br/>but I&apos;m having more trouble with the 1+9 decatonic MOS, which is<br/>supposed to be &quot;diatonic&quot; basis for miracle, yes? I can&apos;t figure out<br/>how to make any sense out of it.</p><p>I started messing around with porcupine[7] after seeing the note about<br/>it in the tctmo, and was similarly perplexed with it until I finally<br/>tried having the generators go downward, and came across the beautiful<br/>Lssssss mode (and realizing that it&apos;s an 11-limit scale). And since<br/>then I&apos;ve become more able to understand the porcupine modes, and am<br/>finally working towards a porcupine composition. I figured that<br/>miracle, since it&apos;s so popular, would be another &quot;intuitive&quot; scale...<br/>but I&apos;ve hit a wall.</p><p>I can&apos;t get my head wrapped around it. What&apos;s the basic sonority<br/>supposed to be, the neutral triad? Or is it that people are using<br/>4:5:7 as stable fifthless sonorities? And if so, how are things<br/>supposed to resolve, being as all of the consonant triads are a secor<br/>away from each other? Or, is it that people use constantly shifting<br/>decatonic scales as intermediate reference frames as part of some<br/>larger blackjack structure, similar as to what I was trying to do with<br/>my diatonic-modes-as-chords approach? (Also, why is the sssssssssL<br/>mode the &quot;basic&quot; one used in decimal?)</p><p>Right now my approach to miracle has just been a way to use it to<br/>approximate JI. Which is great and all, but I get the feeling there<br/>must be some underlying musical system here that I&apos;m missing.<br/>Porcupine, for example, has turned out to be far more than just a way<br/>to approximate JI with less notes.</p><p>Either way, some insight would be appreciated. I&apos;ve read Graham&apos;s<br/>pages on it a zillion times but I&apos;m still not &quot;getting&quot; it. Some<br/>insight into miracle theory would be much appreciated, or some musical<br/>examples in it demonstrating some resolutions perhaps, or entire<br/>pieces of music. Right now I&apos;m having trouble making musical sense of<br/>it, and a neutral triad is just too hard for me to swallow as a I<br/>chord (maybe I&apos;ll get used to it).</p><p>Thanks<br/>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92572 href="#92572">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2010 11:58:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t get my head wrapped around it.

But the &quot;simplest&quot;<br/>scale (and hence the most intuitive sounding, with the most common<br/>tones pivoting between the two adjacent chords) that supports D7 is D<br/>phrygian dominant, as in D Eb F# G A Bb C D. This is the fifth mode of<br/>G harmonic minor, and resolves beautifully to Gm as such. Just for<br/>fun, try this voicing:</p><p>D-G-C-Eb-Bb-D -&gt; D-F#-C-Eb-A-C -&gt; G-Bb-D-E-A-C#</p><p>You can either then resolve the C# at the end up to D or revel in the<br/>sweet, sweet dissonance contained therein. Either way, D phrygian<br/>dominant (G harmonic minor) will be simplest over the first 2 chords,<br/>and G dorian #4 (mode of D harmonic minor) will work best over the<br/>last one. Make it G dowian #4 #7 if you want, it&apos;s up to you.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the usual canon jazz, trick, however. This is like the<br/>&quot;halfway between jazz and classical&quot; trick that I&apos;ve come to really<br/>enjoy playing in - what guys like Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett, Brad<br/>Mehldau got amazingly good at. But the usual canon jazz trick,<br/>however, is probably more interesting from a microtonal theory<br/>standpoint.</p><p>The usual canon jazz trick here is to use the altered scale over a<br/>dom7 going to minor, as in D Eb F Gb Ab Bb C D. Since jazz people know<br/>all about Rothenberg and regular tempering (lol, I wish), they&apos;ve made<br/>use of the fact that 128/125 is tempered out, and hence D-Gb is an<br/>ambiguous interval and could also be D-F#, and so they do use it that<br/>way. This has a different sound to it than the other one - it&apos;s a bit<br/>more poignant and in some cases a bit &quot;dirtier&quot; sounding.</p><p>The other canon jazz trick, which isn&apos;t used so much when a dom7 is<br/>going to minor but rather as an alternate way to go to major, is to<br/>use the octatonic scale (the one that starts on a half step and then a<br/>whole step). So if you&apos;re going Dm7-&gt;G7-&gt;Cmaj, and you want to put a<br/>b9 and a and say a natural 13 (or any other extension in that scale),<br/>you can use the G octatonic scale. So play a G7omit 5 in the left<br/>hand, and on top of it play C#maj -&gt; Bbmaj -&gt; Gmaj -&gt; Emaj or any of<br/>the usual diminished scale &quot;tricks&quot; that people love to abuse, and<br/>then voice lead to Cmaj and you win internets.</p><p>So if you&apos;re going to play a dom7 chord with a b or a #9, and a #11,<br/>and a b13, you&apos;re taught to use the octatonic scale instead of<br/>something like C Db E F# G A Bb C. Note also that said scale is<br/>improper, but if you add the ornamental D# you get the proper<br/>octatonic scale. So knowing all about Rothenberg, they wanted to prove<br/>him wrong in his paper 50 years in the future at the footnote at the<br/>bottom of page 231 when he says that no examples have been studied in<br/>which ornamental tones have been added to turn an improper scale into<br/>a proper scale. They also place the octatonic scale in the middle of a<br/>diatonic chord progression to take advantage of the fact that 648/625<br/>and 81/80 are both tempered out in 12-tet. I mean, they didn&apos;t know<br/>what the hell they were doing and just stumbled on it.</p><p>Anyways, I&apos;m completely rambling now, but point is: if I could figure<br/>out how to generalize the above to miracle and porcupine and such, I&apos;d<br/>be a happy, happy man :) And also, theories of how tonality works that<br/>I&apos;ve read so far generally leave all of the above out, and hence leave<br/>me unsatisfied. And also hence why I am so adamant that scales besides<br/>aeolian and ionian can be used to form tonal systems. I mean, when the<br/>scale is changing on every chord like this and yet one note still ends<br/>up being emphasized mentally as the tonic, the whole concept seems to<br/>become meaningless...</p><p>&gt; but to me its just a chord<br/>&gt; which needs a chromatic interval (b9). If there is some way<br/>&gt; to think of 7-limit tetrads as coming from a related sequence<br/>&gt; of miracle[10] modes, I suppose that&apos;d be pretty dope, but<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll have to discover it because my lazy approach is more<br/>&gt; chord-centric and involves remembering as few scales as<br/>&gt; possible :0 -Carl</p><p>That&apos;s pretty much my life&apos;s mission right now, haha. :)</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92580 href="#92580">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/2010 2:25:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can&apos;t get my head wrapped around it.

I can definitely get into blackjack,<br/>&gt; but I&apos;m having more trouble with the 1+9 decatonic MOS, which is<br/>&gt; supposed to be &quot;diatonic&quot; basis for miracle, yes? I can&apos;t figure out<br/>&gt; how to make any sense out of it.</p><p>I used it as a basis for notation, and also as a diatonic basis for<br/>chromatic alterations.  It&apos;s like in a minor key, you have a 7 note<br/>diatonic as the natural scale, but there are really 9 notes in the<br/>gamut, and more as chromatic alterations.  With Miracle, I&apos;d write<br/>with 10 notes to the octave, and use quommatic alterations freely.<br/>So, you can think of major and minor triads as a altered versions of<br/>the neutral triad.  6:7:9 is a different kind of chord because 6:7 is<br/>two decimal steps instead of three.</p><p>What I&apos;ve also done is write melodies in 10 notes to the octave<br/>without alterations, and then fill in the accidentals so that the<br/>harmony works.  And I took 7 out of those 10 alterable notes to be the<br/>equivalent of a diatonic, not the decimal scale.</p><p>I tended towards 4:6:7 as the basic chord, because it&apos;s easy to switch<br/>between 8:7 and 7:6.  I have examples of this under &quot;Decimal<br/>Counterpoint&quot; but not with the notation.
