Carl L and I exchanged off-list over this point for WEEKS, or<br/>it seemed like it.  I would have grounded to COFT values during the<br/>adaptive relaxation, and did, but through a quirk of chance, noticed<br/>that the ideal adaptive grounding was not quite the same as the COFT<br/>tuning.  The shift is usually around 1/2 cent, so it&apos;s not even worth<br/>getting excited about, but I went ahead and added a call during the<br/>adaptive relaxation phase, to relax the overall grounding points as<br/>well.  I can&apos;t explain why it&apos;s different from COFT, but I&apos;m pretty sure<br/>it&apos;s not due to a bug (yeah, that&apos;s what they ALL say).</p><p>If the model is right (and, of course, it is &quot;right&quot; only to a partial<br/>degree of refinement in any case!), I let the model dictate the results.<br/>As I&apos;m sure do you, I hasten to add!  There just happens to be a slight<br/>tuning improvement (==reduction in pain) from allowing modification of<br/>the grounding points in the adaptive phase.</p><p>I just added code to optionally suppress the adjustment of grounding<br/>tuning during adaptive relaxation.

Repeat many MANY times by Monte Carlo walk;<br/>each node gets lots of chances to re-relax after its neighbors have,<br/>etc.  I was surprised that this crude method works in a reasonable<br/>length of time, but it does, so I haven&apos;t bothered coming up with more<br/>sophisticated relaxation techniques (Carl is still waiting for a<br/>relaxation refinement that&apos;ll handle infinitely rigid vertical springs<br/>with better than zero convergence!).</p><p>In this context, the grounding targets are nodes just as the tuning at<br/>one moment in time is a node.  It takes but a few lines of code to<br/>relax the grounding points, to get that extra 0.2% of pain reduction.<br/>But, considering all the confusion it causes, maybe I should&apos;ve skipped<br/>it!  ;-&gt;</p><p>JdL</p></div>
