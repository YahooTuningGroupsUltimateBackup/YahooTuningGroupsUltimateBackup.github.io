You say</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>To do this on a calculator, use the formula</p><p>ab = exp(b log(a)).</p><p>2cents/1200 = exp((cents/1200)*log 2).<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>(superscripts being lost in the text conversion)</p><p>If a newbie does that on a calculator, it won&apos;t work.  They&apos;ll use<br/>common instead of natural logarithms.
