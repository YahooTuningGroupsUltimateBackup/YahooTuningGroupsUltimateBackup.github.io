In the standard of the twelve tone equal temperament, the error is</p><p>beyond perception for average people. Considering the technique correction of actual</p><p>playing, the Chinese ancient bone flute&iexcl;&macr;s accuracy is a prehistoric miracle.

The music research team did not use the modern standard of A4 = 440 Hz, but instead adopted an arbitrary standard of hole 5 = &apos;C6&apos;. (Based on A4 = 440 Hz, the actual tone of hole 5 was C6 + 2 Hz(20 Hz), averaged over eight trials.)<br/>Then the interval relationships of the sounds from hole 3 to hole 7 fitted reasonably well to the note sequence E6, D6, C6, B5, A5, with the tone of hole 1 = A6 and hole 2 = F#6. On this scale, the tone of the whole tube is G5 or F#5. In Table 1 three of the intervals in M282:20 are evaluated numerically.</p><p>TABLE1: Location Av&apos;g value (Cents) Description<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Btwn hole 1&amp;2 284 minor 3rd<br/>Btwn hole 2&amp;3 244 &gt;maj2nd (whole tone)<br/>Btwn hole 7&amp;tube 260 &lt;minor 3rd but &gt;whole tone</p><p>Tests revealed that the tiny hole next to hole 7 (Fig. 1) was probably drilled to correct the off-pitch tone of the original hole 7; thus a tone of G#5 + 16 Hz was corrected to A5 - 11 Hz, which is much closer to the octave of A6 - 36 Hz.</p><p>Without testing more flutes, we cannot say whether the tonal scale of the bone flute of Jiahu (M282:20) is the ancestor of either the six-tone Qing Shan scale or the seven-tone Xia Shi scale........</p><p>Shahin mohajeri</p><p>tombak player and researcher , composer</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/acousticsoftombak">www.geocities.com/acousticsoftombak</a></p><p>my tombak musics : <a href="http://www.rhythmweb.com/gdg">www.rhythmweb.com/gdg</a></p><p>my articles in harrmonytalk:</p><p><a href="http://www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000296.html">www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000296.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000288.html">www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000288.html</a></p></div>
