The piece is based on a movement across the utonalities of the<br/>Partch Tonality Diamond. At each step, I play the otonalities of that<br/>tonality step.</p><p>The primary tonality is what I call D++, an 8:7 above the center of a<br/>tonality diamond based on C as 1:1. The song moves around the diamond<br/>by utonality steps in a kind of circle of chords, from D++ (8:7) to F<br/>(4:3) to A flat (8:5), C (1:1), G-- (16:11), to A# (16:9) and back to<br/>D++. If you voice the chords just right, you can go around this cycle<br/>three times and end up with a kind of chromatic scale that drops an<br/>octave; 18 steps from start to finish.</p><p>The song spends most of its time in D++ major otonality. The opening<br/>section uses a horn glissando on a triad 7:9:11 to the triad 8:10:12.<br/>The glide is gradual over a whole note. At the start of the glide,<br/>there is a prominent difference tone three octaves below the 9:11:14.<br/>At the end, the difference tone is one octave below the 10:12:16. I<br/>play around with shifting difference tones all throughout the piece,<br/>some more prominently than others.</p><p>The instruments used are trombones, tuba, flute, cello, violin,<br/>guitar, finger piano, and percussion. Bass gongs that glissando down<br/>appear at different times.</p><p>The title is taken from the South American native Jivaro warriors, who<br/>smeared themselves with blood and danced with the shrunken heads of<br/>their enemies dramatizing the killing. Tsantsa is the native word for<br/>shrunken head. Imagine hearing the trombone glissandos across the<br/>forest valley, the triumphant victory dance of revenge.</p><p>Set the riffmobile to triademonium, sit back and listen to the<br/>changes. Notice your head getting smaller?</p><p>The voicings of the chords are what make the circle of tonalities<br/>interesting. For example, to move through D++, F, Ab, C, G--, D++, I<br/>voice the D++ as 4:5:6, F as 3:4:5, Ab as 5:6:8, C as 4:5:6, G- as<br/>5:6:8, and D++ now as 3:4:5. Repeat the cycle with F as 5:6:8, Ab as<br/>4:5:6, C as 3:4:5, G- as 4:5:6, and D++ as 5:6:8. The third time,<br/>voice F as 4:5:6, Ab as 3:4:5, C as 5:6:8, and G- as 3:4:5, back to<br/>D++ as 4:5:6. This creates a descending chromatic-like scale on the<br/>high notes of the chords. I call them A+, A-, Ab, G, G--, F, Gb, F, E-<br/>-, E, D--, D, D++, C, C, C, B--, A#, back to A+, the 3:2 above D++.<br/>Notice that it doesn&apos;t really always descend. Sometimes I hang out at<br/>G- or C for a clean 4:5:6. Sometimes I include the 7:9:11 or its<br/>revoicing as 9:11:14, or 11:14:18. Sometimes there is a glissando<br/>from the lower number ratios to the higher or visa versa. Lots of<br/>activity at all times.</p><p>The rhythm is based on cycles of 2:4:6 or 4:6:2 or 6:2:4,<br/>imultaneously or opposed.</p><p>The sounds are all created using Csound and the McGill University<br/>Master Samples, plus some of my own for the finger piano. I use<br/>Csound to create the piece. The beauty of Csound for me is the<br/>ability to control every instrument&apos;s envelope individually for every<br/>note, including crescendo and decrescendo, and all the other<br/>musically relevant articulations that make a composition come alive.<br/>I also make use of the ability in Csound to move pitches around,<br/>through a function table to control glissando for every note,<br/>individually. Finally, Csound makes it possible to base the tuning on<br/>non-twelve-tone-to-the-octave tunings. In my case, Csound has allowed<br/>me to explore the Partch Tonality Diamond, for the past six years.<br/>There is no other way to make music for me.
