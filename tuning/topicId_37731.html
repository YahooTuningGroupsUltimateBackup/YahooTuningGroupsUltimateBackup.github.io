If it<br/>was very short I would have probably let it go.  But I am in great spirits<br/>after a wonderful day with my youngest sister and her family in Golden&apos;s<br/>Bridge, NY.And not that the AFMM season is concluding for the year, I think I<br/>can respond, and should respond.  I&apos;m sure you will enjoy at least some of my<br/>response.</p><p>&gt; I challenge anyone to detect a one cent error even with unisons when<br/>&gt; the pitches are not simultaneous and there is a gap of over half a<br/>&gt; second between two consecutive pitches one cent apart. I can barely<br/>&gt; hear two cents under these conditions and wouldn&apos;t notice it if I<br/>&gt; weren&apos;t looking for it. If there are those who can meet this<br/>&gt; challenge successfully, they are so rare as to be insignificant in<br/>&gt; any practical musical scenario.</p><p>Well, of course I only know that I can vocalize and play on a recorder<br/>cent-step intervals.  I know I can juggle them on voice, recorder, and<br/>bassoon.  My players must be able to double others without vibrato.  Oh, it<br/>shouldn&apos;t be insignificant for a fine-eared person to be a music director,<br/>like yourself?  Wouldn&apos;t a .5 cent error be safer?  Maybe there is a good<br/>reception for more accurate pitches electronically that could aid electronic<br/>music.  14 bit pitch bend MIDI has available 16,384-equal temperament already<br/>available.  What are we waiting for?</p><p>No one would be happier than I if such people abounded. I find my  &gt;<br/>&gt; ears constantly assailed by tin-eared &quot;musicians&quot; who miss with<br/>&gt; pitches orders of magitude worse. They have, nevertheless, somehow<br/>&gt; been contracted to perform for classical recordings on well-known<br/>&gt; commercial labels.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is, though, all relative, I mean about the tin-eared &quot;musicians.&quot;  Vibrato<br/>is a horrible distortion on the voice that seems always best to me when I am<br/>relatively unaware of it.  All too often is an automatic mask on the sound.<br/>Once again, might not greater divisions that we can consciously hear, aid in<br/>timbres to be produced by electronics?</p><p>&gt; So I would like to suggest that we have much bigger fires to fight<br/>&gt; than squabbling over errors under two cents. One of the main<br/>&gt; objections I hear to anything other than 12t-ET is that the<br/>&gt; differences between 12t-ET and JI are not practically significant.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Rather than fight any fires, I do have a story.  I once coached some early<br/>music singers for performances of Wilbye and Weelkes, just 2 songs.  The<br/>soprano kept snapping into equal tempered perfect fifths.  It was<br/>striking...it&apos;s like her vocal chord had been set at a place like an old<br/>neglected piano and couldn&apos;t readjust.  Even she was shocked that she did<br/>this.  She had perfect pitch and so she was quite aware she was doing this.<br/>And it is only a bit under 2 cents.</p><p>Now, when you speak about how the differences between 12t-ET and JI are not<br/>practically significant.  I have to stop and think again.....Hmn.....I guess<br/>this would put my work with Werckmeister for Bach beneath notice, and<br/>insignificant.  I&apos;m not really offended, but I would ask you to consider if<br/>this might not be more of a value judgment than you intended?<br/>It seems that the intensity that tuning matters held by certain important<br/>musical individuals in early music history testifies to the significance that<br/>they felt.</p><p>&gt; This burns me, but squabbling over errors under two cents when they<br/>&gt; are not cumulative completely undermines any case we could make in<br/>&gt; answer to such stupidity and classifies us to the common practice<br/>&gt; world as anally afflicted theoretical nitpickers.  Moreover, during<br/>&gt; the infamous and strange Jerries experiments, I failed to see any<br/>&gt; evidence among those of us who participated that anything like this<br/>&gt; kind of aural acumen exists even among us microtonal enthusiasts.</p><p>The Jerries experiments didn&apos;t seem to function well and I did not<br/>participate, regardless.  I am not theoretical at all.  I am all about<br/>performance.  And if it is all the same to you, please, let us err on the<br/>side of greater acuity.  It is available, if only as an ideal.  Now a big<br/>waterbug has just climbed onto my desk and I will have to go.  My cat should<br/>find it by morning.  For now, I thank you for your consideration.  best,<br/>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>&gt; And by the way, 612-EDO is incredibly accurate through 19-limit if we<br/>&gt; don&apos;t remain &quot;anal&quot; about very small errors that are still larger<br/>&gt; than &quot;a fifth of a cent&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=37733 href="#37733">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2002 9:29:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>And if it is all the same to you, please, let us err on the<br/>&gt; side of greater acuity.</p><p>What is your notion of an acutity beyond which we don&apos;t need to go?

Again,<br/>&gt; this is an important question when dealing with microtemperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>My point is that none of us have had the precision available through MIDI<br/>which would allow what some on the list think is overkill.  My point is at<br/>first intuitive in that I suspect that the most control we have of the tools<br/>for making patches, the more powerful the musical instrument.  Right now<br/>synthesizers are using the 14 bit greater acuity for Theremin because it<br/>creates a truly believable analog quality for the glissando.  This alone may<br/>be worth the greater possibilities.  Timbre, too, might be a new development<br/>with precisions possible.  Imagine a hint of an interval so exactly in synch<br/>that it truly has a different effect, meaning, noticeability, etc.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=37759 href="#37759">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2002 2:26:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; One of the main<br/>&gt; &gt; objections I hear to anything other than 12t-ET is that the<br/>&gt; &gt; differences between 12t-ET and JI are not practically<br/>&gt; &gt; significant.</p><p>&gt; Now, when you speak about how the differences between 12t-ET and JI<br/>are not<br/>&gt; practically significant.
