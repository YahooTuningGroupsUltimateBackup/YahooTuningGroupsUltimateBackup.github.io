Scales in the same equivalence<br/> class, defined as having the same rank-order matrix, tend to be heard<br/>as retuning of each other.  However, this perception depends upon one&apos;s<br/>sensitivity to small pitch deviations in context. Some listeners in some<br/>contexts might hear the Pythagorean, 12-tet, meantone, and 5-limit JI<br/>versions of the major scale as the same scale.</p><p>(The rank-order matrix is derived from the difference matrix by<br/>numbering each interval<br/>class 1,2,.... in increasing order of size. Two scales whose ROM&apos;s are<br/>the same are considered to be in the same equivalence class. The 4<br/>different tunings of the major mode above fall into 4 distinct EC&apos;s.<br/>Furthermore, the Pythagorean tuning is improper, the JI and Meantone (as<br/>31-tet) are strictly proper, and the12- tet is proper. However, to one<br/>not melodically sensitive to the syntonic and ditonic commas, these<br/>tunings may be perceived as categorically identical.)</p><p>Similarly, raised leading tones and other expressive inflections might<br/>or might not be considered out of tune, depending on context.<br/>Rothenberg&apos;s Range and Blur functions are also relevant here as some<br/>inflections are propriety-preserving modifications of the underlying<br/>scale(s) and some are not. It&apos;s a very complex question, alas, with no<br/>simple answers or rules.</p><p>Fractal scales: I&apos;ve generated some more self-similar scales with a<br/>simple program and will be happy to share the method and results with<br/>anyone who wants it.  Or I could post a brief description and some<br/>examples of the output.</p><p>--John</p></div>
