If we want a new scale better than 12 TET, its deviation cents should be greater than 4 cents. Before, I had considered that 2 cents sets the threshold for entering to a sector of distinguishable scales respect to 12 tet. A threshold of  4 cents establishes the needed gap.</p><p>It means that Piagui scales don&apos;t comply with this requirement and that the research I did produced three scales which lie in the group of 12 tet variants or something like that.</p><p>Piagui and Justharm scale parameters (K, P, M, J, U, The progression of musical cells) might perhaps do something to delete this unexpected final.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, January 14, 2010  ---- 09:50 a.m.<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Mike Battaglia<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Monday, January 11, 2010 2:15 PM<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Four cents + two cents</p><p>  There are certain contexts in which a 4 cent deviation would be noticeable. If you play a C major chord and the E is 4 cents flat and the G is 4 cents sharp, that would actually be an 8 cent difference, for example. But my point was that compared to the other tunings floating around here, yours is closer to 12-tet than those. It differs only minimally from 12-tet, and as you yourself said, it is right on the threshold of a barely perceptible difference for -some- people.</p><p>  As for the validity of the progression of musical cells, I still don&apos;t understand exactly what you&apos;re doing, because you have never explained it with terminology that I am familiar with. Referring to a interval as 1.05237428346953274 doesn&apos;t mean much to me. It isn&apos;t like I have a lookup table in my head of fractions and their corresponding decimals.</p><p>  -Mike</p><p>  On Mon, Jan 11, 2010 at 1:50 PM, Mario Pizarro &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    Hi,</p><p>    Some weeks ago I needed information regarding man sensitivity respect to cents deviations from 12tet and received a fully explanation from a wise member of the list (Mike Battaglia is another wise member). There I knew, among other important data, that man sensitivity varies; that some people can even distinguish 2 cents deviation though this is not a common figure. His opinions on this matter let me understand that a figure of 4 cents is a safe sensitive degree for an unknown percentage of people that use to hear music so a scale having 4, 2.5, 0.2,   4, 2.5, 0.2,  4, 2.5, 02,  4, 2.5, 0.2  deviation cents should be at least weakly distinguishable from 12tet.<br/>    I am giving the above information/opinions due to what Mike stated on this matter that is copied below. Let me add that nobody analyzed the clar features of the Progression of Musical Cells.<br/>    -------<br/>    &gt;I am using the standard in this case of what the human ear will be able to distinguish, and it will be able to distinguish only minimal differences between 12-tet and your scale. I am also seeing how it compares to other temperaments, and in this respect it is a -LOT- closer to 12-tet than many commonly used ones. So in both of regards, a temperament that is within 4 cents at all times of 12-tet will be a LOT &quot;closer&quot; to 12-tet than a temperament that has a major third that is 10 cents closer to 5/4 than 12-tet&apos;s is, or that represents 7/4 to within 3 cents. 41-equal, 53-equal, miracle temperament, etc can do all of these things, your temperament cannot. Your temperament can in general handle all of the intervals that 12-tet can.</p><p>    &gt;Those are my standards for judging how &quot;valid&quot; a temperament is or how &quot;close&quot; to 12-tet it is. What are yours?</p><p>    -Mike<br/>    ---------------</p><p>    Thanks</p><p>    Mario Pizarro</p><p>    Lima, Jan.11, 2010 ---- 01:50 p:m.</p><p>    __________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 4762 (20100111) __________</p><p>    ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p>    <a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p><p>  __________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 4762 (20100111) __________</p><p>  ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p>  <a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p><p>__________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 4771 (20100114) __________</p><p>ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p><a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p></div>
