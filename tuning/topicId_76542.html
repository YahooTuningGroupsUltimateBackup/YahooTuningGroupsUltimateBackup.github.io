I was a music student in college and after<br/>finding barbershop harmony I was shocked to hear things like &quot;no, that<br/>one is a larger half step, listen again to get that chord to ring&quot;.</p><p>I found online resources and this list, and I delved in for a long<br/>time trying to understand it all.  I read the majority of all the<br/>common literature on tuning.  I played around with my computer and<br/>retuned my guitar.  In the end, I was pretty frustrated with the<br/>inability to just PLAY the musical ideas that were in my mind.</p><p>Here&apos;s some direction I&apos;ll suggest:</p><p>First, although somewhat technical, Bill Sethares&apos; Book &quot;Tuning Timbre<br/>Spectrum Scale&quot; is unique.  It is among the only ones that doesn&apos;t<br/>just assume the traditional just intonation ideas are correct.  He<br/>shows what really matters: that timbre is a major factor in harmony.<br/>Piano strings are not totally harmonic due to high tension and<br/>thickness and other factors.  Therefore, theoretical just intonation<br/>does not totally apply.  But voices are very harmonic, so there it<br/>does, but the chance of a human voice being absolutely steady is<br/>totally unlikely, so what&apos;s really going on?<br/>Bill&apos;s book includes some recorded examples, and they are decent when<br/>they are programmed, but Bill has a horrible sense of rhythm on some<br/>of the tracks where he recorded his live keyboard playing.  But it is<br/>more than worth it.  His book rises above the crowd as especially<br/>important to really understanding things.</p><p>If your school library doesn&apos;t have it, you can have it sent to you<br/>from another library through the interlibrary loan system (ask a<br/>librarian if you haven&apos;t done this before, it&apos;s marvelous).  Here&apos;s a<br/>link showing all the libraries that have it and the info about the<br/>book.  Be sure to get the second edition:<br/><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55502420">http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55502420</a></p><p>Second, to really understand how people experience real music, you<br/>need to get away from all these mathematical focuses that you may see<br/>discussed here.  Will people think 7-limit music is weird?  Not if<br/>they expect it and get what they expect.  The psychology of music, how<br/>we learn to expect things one way or another is really the way to<br/>approach this.  I am only now getting into this, but the original<br/>seminal book, which I am just now finishing and certainly feel was<br/>very worthwhile is Emotion And Meaning In Music by Leonard Meyer:<br/><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/476460">http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/476460</a></p><p>To summarize my view, if people here a pitch often enough, then they<br/>start to expect it.  If 7-limit music then puts a prominent pitch in a<br/>place where people would expect one but then here a slightly different<br/>one then they feel it as weird.  If it is consistent and expected over<br/>and over, then it is not weird.  And if it is hidden in a background<br/>part and helps create a nice blend but they don&apos;t focus on it, then it<br/>is fine.  In barbershop harmony, it is not only common, it is expected<br/>and celebrated, so any listener gets used to it quite quickly.  In<br/>blues and jazz, and pop music (Beatles were actually pretty good at<br/>this) it is not uncommon to sing a nice 7th over a major chord<br/>background - hence the &quot;blue note&quot; that piano players lament having no<br/>access to.</p><p>At any rate, the only ways to truly explore pitch and not be stuck<br/>with planning and programming are to have pitch flexible instruments<br/>that are reasonably controllable.  If you&apos;re a great singer, that&apos;s<br/>something.  Fretless instruments are useful.  I, for one, just got a<br/>Tonal Plexus from H-Pi: <a href="http://www.h-pi.com">www.h-pi.com</a><br/>And I think this is the very best option.  It is flexible in many<br/>ways, and can be totally retuned however you like.  They also have<br/>accepted for a future goal my suggestion to create a subtle adaptive<br/>algorithm just to eliminate the subtle error from JI that 205ET can<br/>have!  Amazing support.  And this instrument can be played with lots<br/>of theory understanding, or just play it and listen and find sounds<br/>you like!  I wish I had this when I was just starting to explore these<br/>things.</p><p>As for real music that exists so far, among my favorites is the Catler<br/>Brother&apos;s &quot;Crash Landing&quot; CD, which sounds weird to trained musicians<br/>at the first listen.  After about 4 listens, it no longer sounded<br/>weird to me, and in fact almost just sounded mundanely accessible.<br/>Untrained musicians that I&apos;ve played it for almost all enjoy it but<br/>basically say they don&apos;t see what&apos;s so special, just that it&apos;s good music.<br/>See <a href="http://microtones.com">microtones.com</a></p><p>Also, I&apos;ve used Melodyne to retune barbershop harmony and create<br/>totally accurate performances.  I&apos;ve been working on getting them to<br/>be more natural over time as well.  Not sure what links are still<br/>active, but search past postings here for my name and barbershop and<br/>Melodyne or recordings - you&apos;ll come across my postings and hopefully<br/>some links.  I hope to organize this all and get a clear website<br/>together eventually.</p><p>Best wishes on the studies.  Let me know if you have any other<br/>questions or want my thoughts on anything specific.  Judging by your<br/>question, I will be so bold as to say that I think I really came from<br/>the same perspective and mindset.  And I really benefited from help<br/>from those who came before me, so I hope to pass on the favor.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div>
