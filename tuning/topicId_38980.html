And I can tell you the IV chord is<br/>found in most. Occasionally a hymn is composed without it. Appalachian music<br/>uses it frely as well. It usually fails to use the minor 7th chord. As that<br/>was begun to be used in Germany via the Lutheran Reformers who wanted their<br/>congregations to sing in four parts. After they started that, Monteverde<br/>began to use the minor 7th chord in his music. And the &quot;classical&quot; composers<br/>picked up on it after that.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.
