I saw the<br/>&quot;encoders&quot; that were mentioned before, but I believe they are mostly<br/>&quot;conversion&quot; utilities.  I note that &quot;Real Jukebox&quot; is a great playback<br/>software, but doesn&apos;t allow RECORDING of .wav(s) or .mp3(s).</p><p>I know this is bad... but I have to start somewhere, and I&apos;m going to be<br/>&quot;fearless&quot; about it.</p><p>Please keep in mind, if you can explain this, that I know virtually<br/>*nothing* about this arena  (maybe not so much about other arenas either,<br/>but that&apos;s another story - problem...)</p><p>THANKS!!!<br/>_____________ _______ _____ ___ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;DBURGESS@ACCELERATION.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2000 5:12:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph,</p><p>I use Cakewalk proaudio 9.0 (pricey) to do what you describe.
