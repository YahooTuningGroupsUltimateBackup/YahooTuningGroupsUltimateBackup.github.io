But so far, no one has spoken up for the 3 equal chord in opposition to the 225/224 tempered (5/4)^2 (9/7) chord, or the 5 equal chord in opposition to the 1029/1024 tempered (8/7)^4 7/6 chord, what might be called your basic 3, 4, and 5 note nearly equal chords.</p><p>I note that:</p><p>meantone has both the 3 chord and the 4 chord<br/>miracle has both the 3 chord and the 5 chord<br/>valentine has both the 4 chord and the 5 chord<br/>31et has all three kinds of chords</p><p>Meanwhile, 12 has both 3 equal and 4 equal, 15 has both 3 equal and 5 equal, 20 has both 4 equal and 5 equal, and 60 has then all. I think 31 is more impressive, bit 60 also boasts its own version of the (5/4)^2 (9/7) triad. It also does both magic and tritonic, with tritonoc giving loads of opportunities to suffer from the indignity pf listening to tritones which are not exactly sqrt(2).</p></div>
