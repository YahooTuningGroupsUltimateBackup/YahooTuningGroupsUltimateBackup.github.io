First and foremost, I don&apos;t like doublewide temperament but I just want to demonstrate the symmetry within the chord progression (major-minor, minor-major, major-minor, minor-major). In the doublewide example, the equivalence interval is 2/1 and the period is 600 cents. In the meantone example, the equivalence interval is 4/1 and the period is 2/1.</p><p>#2. FYI, both examples were created using the same sequence file, only the actual scales were different.</p><p>Here it is:<br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/symmetric_doublewide.mid">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/symmetric_doublewide.mid</a><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/symmetric_meantone_4.mid">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/symmetric_meantone_4.mid</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2011 10:45:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; #1.

If you want to focus more on the primes to 11 other than 5, the 48 version is good. In either case, two parallel chains of minor thirds.</p></div>
