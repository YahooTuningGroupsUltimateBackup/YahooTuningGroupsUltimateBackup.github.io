Thanks, Gene.  A question, though: in cases where multiple triads collapse to the same subgroup, will it be the case that different temperaments of that subgroups will have different complexity orderings of the different triads?</p><p>I&apos;m afraid so.</p></div><h3><a id=96781 href="#96781">ðŸ”—</a>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2011 11:27:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>here&apos;s my take on just triads.</p><p>Identify all the just intervals an octave or less wide that you consider to be good in harmony.

I played each triad on your list on my Tonal Plexus keyboard, making note of the chords that I hear &quot;clicking in place&quot; and fuse when I play them on the correct keys on the instrument, instead of nearby keys that mistune the pitches by ca. 6 cents or more. The default tuning of the instruments is itself a temperament (205tet) but no interval is more than ca. 3 cents off. For some chords I used a just tuning (less than 0.1 cents off) but mostly I simply played around with the default 205tet. I used an overtone-rich, non-vibrato reed-like patch from a Korg M3 as the sound.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I was able to hear and what I feel I can tune by ear:</p><p>WIth the exception of maybe 12:16:21, 15:18:25 and 16:20:25, I don&apos;t hear the kind of &quot;special&quot; difference in the triads listed in the third column whether they&apos;re in tune or not. Predictably, I can easily hear if a 3:2 or 5:4 in them is mistuned but I can&apos;t hear that tuning the 21&apos;s, 25&apos;s or 27&apos;s accurately would make these rather complex chords sound stable or &quot;just&quot;.<br/>  So I think I would leave the identities 21, 25 and 27 out of my own list of possible just triads.<br/>  I do hear a tiny difference in even the most complex triads on the list but one that I don&apos;t feel is enough for the kind of tunable-by-ear, special relationship that I understand by the term &apos;just&apos;.<br/> I also had trouble with many of the triads involving 15, notably 10:13:15, 12:14:15, 10:14:15 and others. Even so, I would probably keep 15-limit triads on my list.<br/>From the triads in first column, I had difficulties in hearing the ones involving both 7 and 11, or both 7 and 13, click into place when tuned. 7:8:11 is difficult for me, as well as 7:12:13.</p><p>I&apos;m not able to tune 17-limit or 19-limit triads by ear.</p><p>So for my own ears, I would put the odd-limit down to 15. There are higher-limit triads the justness of which I&apos;m able to hear, to be sure.

No primes above 13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. No harmonics above 32; because of 1 and 2, this actually restricts to 27.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. At least two dyads in the triad must be 15 odd-limit or lower.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m posting this because I want to know if you guys think these restrictions are reasonable for what to consider &quot;Just&quot;.
