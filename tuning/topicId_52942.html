It could be compositionally<br/>useful.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***It seems a &quot;hot item&quot; these days in Academia... well, OK, at least<br/>&gt; at Columbia, cf. Chris Bailey, to examine microtonality through the<br/>&gt; lens of &quot;musical set theory...&quot;  I think it&apos;s a good development,<br/>&gt; since at least it gets microtonality studied at such places.</p><p>Actually, I think I am the only one doing that.</p><p>Main reason being,  most composers are rather ANTI-musical-set-theory, at<br/>least when it gets any more technical than &quot;the opening motive of the<br/>piece is transposed, inverted, etc. to form the basis of the harmony of<br/>the piece,&quot;  and even that idea is pretty passe in academic circles.</p><p>The idea that &quot;musical set theory&quot; is de riguer in academia today is silly<br/>(though I suppose it&apos;s true for a few  60+ year old professors), I am at<br/>Cincinnati Conservatory right now,  and the most popular composer &quot;gods&quot;<br/>are John Adams and the whole &quot;Bang on a Can&quot; scene.</p><p>&gt; However, there is still an even *more* exciting intellectual study<br/>&gt; just going after the ratios and such like of just intonation theory<br/>&gt; and temperaments and harmonic entropy... as we have been doing on<br/>&gt; these lists.  Personally, I think these studies are even more<br/>&gt; pertinent and practical than set theory for &quot;real&quot; composing...</p><p>I think &quot;musical set theory&quot; is simply an extension of this . . .<br/>i.e., what you are discussing is basically &quot;scale design&quot;, right?<br/>And essentially, a scale is a set of pitches or pitch-classes.</p><p>The only additional thing that &quot;musical set theory&quot; can do for you is to<br/>enable you to work at the motivic level also---you can work with ordered<br/>motives or unordered &quot;sets&quot;, and derive melodies and harmonies from these.<br/>These are typically 3 or 4 or 5 note sets (at least in 12-TET).   Then of<br/>course you can explore the interaction of these smaller units with larger<br/>&quot;scale-sized&quot; units.</p><p>So yeah. . . ideally musical set theory , as it exists, IS the grand<br/>Unified Theory that some folks have been wondering about.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...But wouldn&apos;t it be exciting if one could join these two sides of<br/>&gt; music theory (musical set theory and tuning theory) into some<br/>&gt; unifing principle? Group Theory may hold the key...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Hj</p><p>See above. . .</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Well, knowledge is power... (since when? :) but the danger, I<br/>&gt; think lies in the generally-accepted compositional procedures used<br/>&gt; with these kind of methodologies... ie., people tend to manipulate<br/>&gt; sets rather than to actually *listen* to the material.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If something *audible* comes out of this kind of study, so much the<br/>&gt; better.  I&apos;m just saying that, generally speaking, that&apos;s *not* the<br/>&gt; direction composition has taken with these approaches in the past...<br/>&gt; maybe because it&apos;s just too easy to compose this way without<br/>&gt; listening to the material... :)</p><p>Well, I definitely take the attitude that &quot;theoretical manipulations are<br/>no excuse for a music that does not kick ass.&quot;</p><p>Having said that, however, I think the attitude way back when was that<br/>writing with these procedures might lead our ears to new things that we<br/>might hear as &quot;kicking ass&quot; that we wouldn&apos;t have expected before.</p><p>Obviously,  this wasn&apos;t always the case,  and now we can be more critical.<br/> . . . but there is something to be said for experimenting,  and leading<br/>one&apos;s ears in new directions.  Which may mean yes--occasionally composing<br/>without listening.  No garuntee of success of course.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Errm... But you cannot blame the methodologies for this, can you?<br/>&gt; Composing without listening is definitely a thing NOT to be done. If a<br/>&gt; composer does so, all the worse for him - but that&apos;s hardly the<br/>&gt; methodology&apos;s fault; i&apos;d rather call it a wrong understanding what is<br/>&gt; appropriate or even lacking mastery of the method.</p><p>What do you think of John Cage?  I believe he stopped composing &quot;by ear&quot;<br/>in any sense of the word--after 1950.</p><p>I would say the results are mixed. . .sometimes fantastic,  sometimes not<br/>so exciting.  Though he would probably say that&apos;s my fault.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I occasionally hear arguments like this in the context of questions<br/>&gt; like whether you should study counterpoint or Schenkerian analysis or<br/>&gt; music theory at all, and there they are not more convincing to me...</p><p>Shenker?  But with that you HAVE to listen to do it right?</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2004 10:21:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52942">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52942</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; ***It seems a &quot;hot item&quot; these days in Academia... well, OK, at<br/>least<br/>&gt; &gt; at Columbia, cf.

My point is<br/>that &quot;musical set theory&quot; can give you tools to help you do that.</p><p>Not that you HAVE to work that way,  but just that you CAN if you<br/>want.</p><p>Of course,  it&apos;s more complex when you&apos;re using non-Equal-Tempered<br/>source scales, since things can&apos;t just be tranposed and inverted<br/>willy-nilly.</p><p>But, in those cases, the  lattices that we all love so much<br/>essentially tell you what kind of musical-set-theory operations you<br/>can do within your scale-set, that will preserve intervals and hence<br/>sound-quality.    I.e., you can clearly see what transpositions,<br/>inversions, etc. are possible.</p><p>Of course,  the possitibilities may be very limited,  and one might<br/>also be very interested in transposing something in such a way that<br/>it DOESN&apos;t sound the same, etc.</p><p>But the point is that all of these things can be related to musical<br/>set theory in the end.  A scale is a musical-set, so if you&apos;re using<br/>a scale,  you&apos;re using a musical-set.  And if you&apos;re doing something<br/>motivic or in any way algorithmic to it,  then what you&apos;re doing can<br/>probably be described in those terms.
