In 36-tET,<br/>these intervals are approximated as 300 cents and 333.33... cents.</p><p>In practice, I tend to use a generic &quot;*&quot; or &quot;diesis&quot; sign for this<br/>interval and various larger ones in the range of around 35-70 cents, a<br/>usage somewhat connected to Vicentino&apos;s original diesis sign (actually<br/>a dot above a note) more specifically suggesting an interval of<br/>1/5-tone in a circulating 31-note tuning such as 1/4-comma meantone or<br/>31-tET.</p><p>Especially in a gentler timbre, 36-tET can be used as both a<br/>neo-Gothic and &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; tuning, with the 1/6-tone interval<br/>serving for the latter type of style as a kind of small diesis. It is<br/>actually not too much smaller than the smaller fifthtone of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, the difference between the chromatic semitone (~76.05 cents)<br/>and the 128:125 diesis (~41.06 cents), or about 34.99 cents.</p><p>Thus while there is no neat and invariable mapping between neo-Gothic<br/>&quot;septimal comma&quot; and any 48-tET/144-tET interval, I would warmly agree<br/>that the 1/8-tone of 25 cents would be a nice approximation in some of<br/>the most characteristic tunings.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2001 8:22:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Joe Pehrson, and it&apos;s a pleasure to be discussing theory<br/>in an ideal place: the Alternate Tuning List.</p><p>First of all, apart from identifying myself as a self-proclaimed<br/>&quot;tuning.kook&quot; (it&apos;s time, in my view, to associate the word &quot;kook&quot;<br/>with fun and zaniness and creative wackiness rather than with<br/>incivility and other unpleasantries), I wouldn&apos;t attempt to say who<br/>has the most or least &quot;unconventional&quot; view on this issue.</p><p>Looking specifically at European music, I would concur in part and<br/>dissent in part from a statement that this music &quot;is based on<br/>small integer ratios.&quot;</p><p>If you were to say that stable concords in medieval-Romantic music are<br/>generally based on some ratios or reasonably close approximations, I<br/>would agree: the 2:3:4 trine and 4:5:6 triad indeed fit this paradigm.</p><p>However, for example, Pythagorean tuning in its historical Gothic form<br/>mostly has _low_ integer ratios like 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8, plus some<br/>octave extensions or complements (e.g. a 16:9 minor seventh, which I<br/>consider &quot;just&quot; but some other people regard as psychoacoustically<br/>complex) -- but also lots of _large_ integer ratios.</p><p>Further, the _large_ integer ratios of Pythagorean tuning include some<br/>very important &quot;partial concords&quot; (e.g. major and minor thirds at<br/>81:64 or ~407.82 cents, and 32:27 or ~294.13 cents) quite vital to the<br/>cadential and coloristic qualities of 13th-14th century music. Just<br/>try removing all of the thirds and sixths from Perotin or Machaut, for<br/>example -- let&apos;s say when playing them on a Pythagorean keyboard, to<br/>avoid issues of shifts in either direction that could occur with<br/>non-fixed-pitch ensembles.</p><p>Also, I&apos;d say that melody is important, and melodic semitones often<br/>tend to have complex ratios.</p><p>Thus I&apos;d say we have a mixture of simple and complex ratios, with<br/>various degrees of concord or discord -- 13th-century theorists may<br/>offer four, five, or six categories from the purest concords to the<br/>most acute discords.</p><p>Curiously, &quot;Pythagorean&quot; and &quot;JI&quot; are often taken almost as opposites,<br/>since &quot;JI&quot; often implies &quot;5-limit or higher,&quot; likely reflecting the<br/>complexities of trying to mesh two or more incommensurate prime<br/>factors like 3 and 5 (the Renaissance dilemma).</p><p>For me, &quot;JI&quot; mainly implies that _some_ intervals have pure and<br/>reasonably simple ratios, like 3:2 and 4:3 in Pythagorean, and also<br/>9:7, 7:6, and 7:4 in Pythagorean-derived systems based on factors of 3<br/>and 7.</p><p>What I often favor might be called &quot;kooky JI,&quot; because it doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily follow a &quot;low ratios _whenever possible_&quot; approach, but<br/>seeks a partnership of small and large ratios.</p><p>Maybe the dilemma for JI with two or more primes other than 2 is about<br/>as follows:</p><p>         (1) Seek low ratios everywhere, and run into complications<br/>             with melodic unevenness or comma shifts where you<br/>             might not want them;</p><p>         (2) Temper in some way -- or maybe &quot;adaptively tune&quot; so as<br/>             to split melodic differences while maintaining pure<br/>             and simple vertical concords;</p><p>         (3) Mix low and high JI (integer-based) ratios, seeking<br/>             evenness or uneveness, vertical &quot;purity&quot; or &quot;complexity,&quot;<br/>             and lots of contrasts -- as desired.</p><p>Please let me add that forms of &quot;strict&quot; 2/3/7 JI with a consistent<br/>(in the usual nontechnical sense) use of sonorities such as<br/>12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 can be very charming. However, I like<br/>54:64:81:96 or 64:81:96:108 also, and a tuning with two Pythagorean<br/>manuals a 64:63 or 7:6 apart makes it easy to shift between these<br/>flavors.</p><p>CAUTION: Another basic cultural distinction may affect the reading of<br/>this last paragraph. For me, as for medieval European theorists,<br/>citing a ratio simply says that these are the integers or string<br/>lengths defining the interval. However, some people take these ratios<br/>to imply relations involving the harmonic series -- something I would<br/>assume for 3:2 or 9:8, but not necessarily for 81:64 or 256:243, etc.</p><p>What I&apos;d emphasize is that &quot;JI&quot; is not a monolithic bloc. For example,<br/>consider a point of lattice making.</p><p>One thing I notice is that if making a lattice with a 3/7-JI kind of<br/>tuning, I tend to take the 3:2 as the horizontal dimension, and the<br/>7:6 as the vertical dimension, so that we get quadrangles or &quot;quads&quot;<br/>of 12:14:18:21 (or 14:18:21:24, depending how you read). Here I&apos;ll a<br/>use a neo-Gothic &quot;v&quot; to show a note lowered by a septimal comma of<br/>64:63 from Pythagorean, or ~27.26 cents (close to the 25-cent &quot;v&quot; or<br/>1/8-tone of Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s 144-tET notation):</p><p>  Gbv -- Dbv -- Abv -- Ebv ...<br/>  /      /     /      /<br/> /     /     /      /<br/>Eb -- Bb --  F --  C ...</p><p>Interestingly, I&apos;d guess, the majority of JI folks tend to look for<br/>lattice patterns based on 4:5:6:7, with 7:4 rather than 7:6 as the<br/>main &quot;7-based&quot; interval. Such are the varieties of tastes and<br/>outlooks.</p><p>A curious aside, as long as we&apos;re talking about the nonmonolithic<br/>nature of &quot;JI&quot; -- with temperaments, also, I find it very cool to have<br/>&quot;two versions of the same note&quot; about 15-30 cents apart.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that every 24-note temperament I find interesting has<br/>to do this: Vicentino&apos;s, whether taken as 1/4-comma meantone or some<br/>conceptual model of 31-tET, doesn&apos;t, and it&apos;s a great tuning! (The<br/>smallest step is ~34.99 cents, the &quot;small fifthtone,&quot; in 1/4-comma, or<br/>of course 1/31 octave or ~38.70 cents, I guess, in 31-tET).</p><p>Sometimes evenness can be very important: I&apos;d say that Manneristic<br/>&quot;fifthtone&quot; music is indeed meant to have reasonably equal fifthtones<br/>or dieses, and that means something close to 1/4-comma or 31-tET. In<br/>moving from a minor third to a &quot;proximate minor third&quot; to a major<br/>third (in JI terms, 6:5 - 11:9 - 5:4), those steps should be even.</p><p>A difference of 6 cents, like in 1/4-comma, is no problem; but<br/>2/7-comma, for example, has a different feel and &quot;mood&quot; (to speak in a<br/>Darregian manner). It&apos;s a great 24-note system, but has a different<br/>temperament (to borrow a pun from Mark Lindley) than the style of<br/>16th-century enharmonicism.</p><p>Of course, I favor high-integer &quot;rational intonation&quot; or RI as a kooky<br/>and pleasantly subversive approach to questioning some of these set<br/>categories and factions. Jacky Ligon is my treasured comrade in this,<br/>and I would be honored to be called a &quot;numerologist&quot; for my pains<br/>&lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Sometimes I suspect that some of the &quot;JI debates&quot; involve a lot of<br/>implicit points of agreement between the &quot;sides&quot; where some us might<br/>have different views.</p><p>For example, people in a &quot;JI vs. temperament&quot; debate may already<br/>pretty much agree that &quot;low integer ratios are where it&apos;s at,&quot; and are<br/>debating whether to use untempered ratios or maybe something like<br/>72-tET. There&apos;s a lot of common ground on general philosophy, and<br/>maybe on stylistic assumptions also.</p><p>What I&apos;d say is that there&apos;s a big continuum out there, and that JI/RI<br/>is one very interesting way to approach it. It doesn&apos;t have to be<br/>&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong,&quot; only musically engaging in its many quite<br/>nonmonolithic forms as _one_ of the available choices.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/25/2001 12:50:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26424">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26424</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Joe Pehrson, and it&apos;s a pleasure to be discussing<br/>theory in an ideal place: the Alternate Tuning List.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much, Margo, and this does *indeed* seem to be the<br/>place for such discussion... unless, of course, it gets excessively<br/>mathematical, in which case it goes to the *math tuning* list, *or*<br/>it gets exceedingly compositional, in which case it goes to Jon<br/>Szanto&apos;s new CreateMicroMusic list...  :)</p><p>I guess these days we live in an era of specialization.
