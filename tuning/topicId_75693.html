I still intend to<br/>&gt; do my own version.  One fine day.</p><p>Turns out that day was today.  Here&apos;s what I did:</p><p>In each equal temperament between 5 &amp; 99 notes per octave<br/>(inclusive, so 95 ETs in all), I tuned all triads, tetrads,<br/>pentads, and hexads that can be formed from the set<br/>{2 3 5 7 11 13 17}.  That&apos;s 35 + 35 + 21 + 7 = 98 chords<br/>in all.</p><p>For each ET, I kept only the most accurately approximated<br/>triad, tetrad, etc.  So 95 ETs * 4 chord sizes = 380 chords<br/>in all.<br/>I used TOP damage to assess tuning accuracy.  TOP damage<br/>tells you the maximum Tenney-weighted error of any interval<br/>that can be formed from the factors in the chord (after<br/>the octave has been optimally stretched/compressed).</p><p>I then threw out those chords which had more than half the<br/>number of notes of the containing ET.  So tetrads in 5-ET<br/>were thrown out, as were hexads in 7-ET, etc.  For odd ETs,<br/>I let the larger half stay.  So I kept triads in 5-ET, for<br/>example.  This left 368 chords.</p><p>I then threw out chords which were not consistent in the<br/>given ET.  There were 81 of these.  The 287 remaining chords<br/>are listed in this Excel spreadsheet:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/ETsProgram.xls">http://lumma.org/stuff/ETsProgram.xls</a></p><p>They are sorted first by chord size (triads, tetrads, etc.),<br/>and then by increasing badness.  Badness here is TOP damage<br/>times the number of notes in the ET.  Of course you can use<br/>Excel to sort however you like.</p><p>Of note: the &quot;best&quot; triad is 3:5:17 in 72-ET.  The best<br/>tetrad is 2:5:11:13 in 87-ET (Petr&apos;s temperament).  The<br/>best pentad is 2:5:7:11:13 in 37-ET (Petr&apos;s temperament<br/>with 7 added).  The best hexad is 2:3:5:7:11:17 in 72-ET.</p><p>You may argue that I shouldn&apos;t use weighted error here,<br/>since it tends to keep the most consonant chords from<br/>showing up.  And you&apos;d be right.  So I&apos;ll do another<br/>version some other time with unweighted error.</p><p>It could also be said that tuning by &quot;patent val&quot; and<br/>then casting out inconsistent ETs may miss some good<br/>mappings, but I don&apos;t think so.  I think they&apos;ll show<br/>up in the ETs where they are patent.

Period = 2/1, generator = 13th root of 130. First &gt; of all, the generator itself is close to 16/11. Then, 5 of them are close to &gt; 13/2. And finally, 8 of them are close to 20/1. Unfortunately, there&apos;s only &gt; a poor approximation to 3/2. In contrast, the chord of 1:2:5:11:13 is &gt; imitated so well that the intervals are just over half a cent away from JI!<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s what it sounds like: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/04C4C2D07E9D6FE9">http://download.yousendit.com/04C4C2D07E9D6FE9</a></p><p>Oh, yes, <a href="http://2.5.11.13">2.5.11.13</a> is a theoretically interesting limit.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you all know that 4:5:6 triads have some unique properties.  One of them comes in two parts:</p><p>1) The first number in the ratios is 4</p><p>2) No intervals are smaller than 7:6, including with the implied octave.</p><p>No other triads fulfil both these criteria and no triads fulfil a stronger version of (1) where the first number should be 2.  (1) may be important because having a power of two at the bottom makes the root of the chord agree with the fundamental of the virtual pitch.  That may make the sense of rootedness stronger.  (2) is important because smaller intervals will get within the critical band and so sound inherently dissonant regardless of timbre.</p><p>It&apos;s been suggested that 16:19:24 is a target tuning for a minor triad.  That would make sense in the light of these criteria.  However, why jump straight from 4 to 16?  If 16 is good then 8 should be as well.  There are two triads that fulfil the criteria if we change 4 to 8 in (1).  They are 8:10:13 and 8:11:13.</p><p>So, a 2.5.11.13-limit gives us the second and third simplest chords in this family without the luxury of the simplest and most familiar of all (4:5:6).  That means you can experiment with the new chords and avoid the comparison with good old-fashioned major.</p><p>I can&apos;t say if these chords really are special in sound.  I did play with them a while back (in mystery) and they can make good progressions.  But you can convince yourself of anything if you try hard enough.  The only way to establish the theory is for people to make music including the chords and see if they make sense.  It&apos;ll certainly be interesting to find out.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2008 6:36:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; In each equal temperament between 5 &amp; 99 notes per octave<br/>&gt; (inclusive, so 95 ETs in all), I tuned all triads, tetrads,<br/>&gt; pentads, and hexads that can be formed from the set<br/>&gt; {2 3 5 7 11 13 17}.
