What I am attempting to do is take a set of<br/>&gt; ratios for 1 octave (1/1-2/1) and translate them over a wider range of 8<br/>&gt; octaves.  The original octave contains highly specified ratios which are &gt; all<br/>&gt; decimals.  It seems to be moderately difficult.  One idea is to map it as a<br/>&gt; triangle where the top smaller area has the line for the 1 octave range<br/>&gt; while the base of the triangle is the 8 octave range.  I am using scala and<br/>&gt; will want the results to be in hz ( or possibly cents would work) for a non<br/>&gt; linear scale.  If anyone would like to try to solve this problem please<br/>&gt; don&apos;t hesitate to help out.</p><p>I can&apos;t see the problem.  What do you mean by non linear? Why do you need these triangles?  To move ratios up or down an octave you multiply or divide by 2.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
