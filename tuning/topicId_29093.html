If we take rational numbers of<br/>the form a + b*phi we get something called an algebraic number field,<br/>and if a and b are integers, we get its ring of algebraic integers;<br/>these are rather closely analogous to the ordinary rational numbers<br/>and ordinary integers, respectively.</p><p>We also have unique prime factorization. The primes fall into three<br/>groups--the first are those of the form 5n+2 or 5n-2, such as<br/>2,3,7,13 etc. These are inert--they are still primes for golden ratio<br/>numbers. The second kind, of the form 5n+1 or 5n-1 (which we may also<br/>call 10n+1 or 10n-1, since they are all odd) split--that is, factor<br/>into two primes. For example 11 = (3+phi)(3-1/phi) = (3+phi)(4-phi),<br/>and 3+phi and 4-phi are now the new primes. Finally, 5 is unique in<br/>that it ramifies--sqrt(5) is now the new prime number. Phi itself is<br/>called a unit, and has to be added to the factorization list also. If<br/>we put it all together, the new 11-limit looks like</p><p>phi^a 2^b 3^c sqrt(5)^d 7^e (3+phi)^f (4-phi)^g,</p><p>where the exponents are integers.</p><p>We can do all the usual things with these new primes (and our unit,<br/>phi) such as ets, MOS and so forth. Warning--I have no reason to<br/>think this makes much sense musically! A good scale division for this<br/>would be the 19 division, where we have approximations phi~2^13/19,<br/>3~2^(30/19), sqrt(5)~2^(22/19), 7~2^(53/19), 3+phi~2^(42/19) and<br/>4-phi~2^(24/19). If that isn&apos;t good enough, there&apos;s always the<br/>111-division, which comes through like a champ. If you prefer, you<br/>can also make phi and not 2 the exact interval, of course.</p></div>
