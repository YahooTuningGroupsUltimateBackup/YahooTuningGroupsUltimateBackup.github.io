Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2000 11:35:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;In that case I would say taking an electric tuner to a<br/>&gt;concert and trying to experience the music by watching the needle go up and<br/>&gt;down (presumably to make sure your hearing correctly) would be like trying<br/>&gt;to do a simple algebra problem with Russel&apos;s predicate calculus.</p><p>Are we assuming the concert involves a single voice or monophonic instrument<br/>only?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Do we need to modify the definition of propriety? Would this modification<br/>&gt;&gt;have any bearing on your definition of the &quot;best&quot; generator?</p><p>&gt;I think you may be right. . . the first<br/>&gt;question to ask would not be &quot;is this scale proper&quot; but &quot;is this scale<br/>&gt;proper in a system of n pitches per 8ve.&quot;  The same goes for a set of<br/>&gt;pitches described in a different mathematical system, such as the<br/>&gt;pythagorean diatonic.  This scale would be proper in a 12 tone system but<br/>&gt;improper in a 17 note system.  I&apos;m taking for granted a method of<br/>&gt;translation which I need to define more precisely.  The criteria for a good<br/>&gt;translation from, say, a set of heard pitches to a scale of n tones would<br/>&gt;be that intervals between pitches which are heard as the same get the same<br/>&gt;measurement on the scale.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that criterion could help you decide whether n for a<br/>Pythagorean diatonic scale should be 12 or 17 (or 29, . . .)</p><p>&gt;&gt;So in fact, Phibonacci&apos;s points of propriety are higher numbers with<br/>respect<br/>&gt;&gt;to their positions than those of Kornerup&apos;s golden fifth. However, the<br/>Lucas<br/>&gt;&gt;generator of 868.33 cents has got both of them beat.</p><p>&gt;&#x9;I would propose a different way of looking at this problem.  I must<br/>say<br/>&gt;that continued fractions don&apos;t strike me as the most useful way to<br/>&gt;represent it.</p><p>hm -- see below</p><p>&gt;They&apos;re useful for finding a noble number which the<br/>&gt;successive generators approach, but for looking at proper scales which are<br/>&gt;members of the sequence, I find the following representation simpler and<br/>&gt;more descriptive.  We&apos;re considering sequences of numbers which follow the<br/>&gt;rule: the last member of the series at any point is the sum of the previous<br/>&gt;number and some earlier number in the series.</p><p>OK, why is that property important?</p><p>&gt;Then we consider sequences<br/>&gt;where the latter number must be the number only two places previous in the<br/>&gt;series.</p><p>Have you been brainwashed by Yasser? :) :) :)</p><p>&gt;In this case the first two numbers of the series define the entire<br/>&gt;series, Phibonacci&apos;s minimizes the magnitude of the numbers with respect to<br/>&gt;their place in the series (we have to add certain constraints which exclude<br/>&gt;irrelevant sequences: the second number must be greater than the first, the<br/>&gt;first number is never 1, in which case the Phibonacci sequence is 2, 3, 5 .<br/>&gt;. . but still has the property in question), and the Lucas sequence fails<br/>&gt;the stronger criteria but can be replaced by 3, 4, 7, 11 . . . which<br/>&gt;satisfies them.</p><p>And the Yasser/Kornerup series would go 2, 5, 7, 12, 19 . . .</p><p>&gt;  The sequence with the least numbers per place satifying<br/>&gt;the weaker criteria is the natural numbers.  An interesting sequence<br/>&gt;failing the stronger but satisfying the weaker criteria is the sequence of<br/>&gt;MOS&apos;s of the pure 5th generator which Pierre mentioned, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 17,<br/>&gt;29, 41 . . .</p><p>The fact that it satisfies the weaker property is intimately intwined with<br/>the continued fractions I used to derive the sequence, in response to<br/>Pierre&apos;s challenge. Think about it! It should work for _any_ generator.</p><p>Also -- I thought you wanted the scales to be proper, but the 7-, 17-, etc.<br/>-tone scales of the pure 5th generator are not proper. The fact that we had<br/>to use incremental values between the continued fraction convergents to get<br/>these scales is closely related to their impropriety.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s still in the works, but I&apos;ll post my results when I come up with<br/>&gt;anything.  There may also be other properties to look at, because with the<br/>&gt;method of beginning with two arbitrary numbers and making a sequence which<br/>&gt;satisfies the strong criteria, some predictable patterns develop in the<br/>&gt;scales.</p><p>Though, once again, I wonder why you&apos;re attracted to the strong criteria,<br/>I&apos;m happy to note that all sequences that satisfy them will turn out to be<br/>the denominantors of the continued fraction convergents of noble numbers,<br/>and conversely.</p></div>
