It uses my &quot;magic&quot; 9-limit<br/>temperament, and the tunings of the bass and chords are mapped to a knob.<br/>It definitely does make a difference to the chords.  So far, although a<br/>few people don&apos;t like the drums, nobody&apos;s noticed anything strange<br/>happening with the tuning.  It varies between and beyond 19 and 22-ED2.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to get this working with Kyma.  Robert Walker says he&apos;s<br/>implemented something like it for meantone in FTS, I don&apos;t know the<br/>details.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
