The<br/>&gt; &gt;serial pitch approach helps a composer defeat a central pitch<br/>&gt; &gt;(tonal center) by presenting all pitches approximately the same<br/>&gt; &gt;number of times. What phenomena in rhythm or dynamics is useful to<br/>&gt; &gt;defeat using similar techniques? A stable rhythm? Dynamics and<br/>&gt; &gt;time-feel that &apos;make sense&apos; musically (i.e., lyricism)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not?<br/>&gt;</p><p>My take (and I stress, my take) on the serial technique is<br/>that it is a recipe that can acheive a few different things<br/>that seemed desireable when tonal materials blew up in<br/>everyones faces through the musics of Wagner, Liszt and<br/>Mahler.</p><p>   1) it will statistically attempt to nullify the<br/>      creation of a tonal center by presenting each pitch<br/>      approximately the same number of times.<br/>   2) if the row is chosen carefully such that no inadvertant<br/>      tonal references are made, then applying the usual serial<br/>      techniques should also result in no inadvertant tonal<br/>      references being made<br/>      (2a inadvertant tonal references are bad only in that<br/>          the point is to control the tension/release of<br/>          the composition and unplanned tonality, like<br/>          unplanned or maltreated dissonances in cookbooks<br/>          from prior centurys, is wresting control of the<br/>          tension/release from the composers hands).<br/>   3) ...and it will do all this with a common thematic<br/>      material that should provide &apos;wholeness&apos; and &apos;coherence&apos;<br/>      to the work, much like theme and variations in prior<br/>      centuries, with the row (or portions of it) supplying<br/>      micro-motifs.</p><p>My question is, what similar problems were presented by the<br/>dynamics used in the prior centuries, or rhythms, that<br/>were addressed by this sort of recipe?</p><p>Now a perfectly good answer may be along the lines of &quot;I<br/>believe that the serial technique is supposed to take the<br/>composer out of the music much the same way as John Cages use<br/>of the IChing or the various improv and highly interpreble<br/>works of Brown and Feldman&quot;. Thats fine and valid, but in<br/>my opinion, is a revisionist approach rather than that of<br/>the first practitioners.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>clumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2002 1:36:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;What phenomena in rhythm or dynamics is useful to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;defeat using similar techniques?
