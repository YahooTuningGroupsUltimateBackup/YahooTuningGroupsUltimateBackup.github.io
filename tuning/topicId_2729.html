Other great pieces by<br/>him are &apos;Octandre&apos;, &apos;Hyperprism&apos; (one of my favorites) and<br/>&apos;Integrales&apos;.</p><p>And, IMO, his masterpiece is &apos;Poeme Electronique&apos;, a work of<br/>_musique concrete_ which I think may be the best of the genre.<br/>Since it was done on tape by Varese himself, there&apos;s only<br/>one version available, and it&apos;s authoritative.</p><p>These are all short pieces, and often found on the same disk.</p><p>&gt; I heard that Captain Beefheart&apos;s band uses microtonal music at<br/>&gt; times.  &lt;shrug&gt;</p><p>Beefheart was a real wildman, whose repertoire of techniques<br/>included a heavy dose of Howlin Wolf vocal stylings, as well<br/>as a very loose and flexible intonation and rhythm among his band.</p><p>General consensus is that his best work is the 1969 album<br/>&apos;Trout Mask Replica&apos; (with a picture of him on the cover wearing<br/>...you guessed it, a trout mask).</p><p>My personal favorite is his 1980 album &apos;Doc At The Radar Station&apos;,<br/>favorite songs &apos;Sue Egypt&apos; and &apos;A Carrot Is As Close As A Rabbitt<br/>Ever Gets To A Diamond&apos;.</p><p>&apos;Doc&apos; was either the last or one of the last albums Beefheart<br/>made - he has since concentrated on painting.  His real name,<br/>BTW, is Don van Vliet, and he was associated with Zappa in<br/>the early days.</p><p>Joseph L.
