That<br/>in number theory, the prime series represents points of<br/>irreducibility, also stands as one of the most important concepts of<br/>JI/RI. We must look no further than our old friend &quot;3/2&quot; to see what<br/>has guided the focus to this new path of tuning exploration (3/2 has<br/>the very interesting and unique quality of having both prime over and<br/>under numbers). My interest in this irreducible quality has led me to<br/>explore scales formed from the prime series, where both the numerator<br/>and denominator are prime numbers. Where both are Prime, these truly<br/>represent unique points of irreducibility along the pitch continuum;<br/>which sometimes is mathematically &quot;unique&quot;, and many other<br/>times &quot;audibly&quot; unique. One could argue that the human ear will<br/>perceive these as lower number ratios, so it should be pointed out<br/>straight away, that the purpose behind the exploration of these<br/>ratios does not pretend to object to this point; with the primary<br/>goal being to identify and make use of the musical possibilities of<br/>the quality of &quot;irreducibility&quot;, by using the Prime Series as a scale<br/>generator. And the truth is; after a point, harmonic concepts<br/>of &quot;limit&quot; become completely irrelevant, and the numbers serve the<br/>sole function of being irreducible scale degree generators. A major<br/>part of the interest in this kind of exploration of high prime<br/>rational intonation, is to see the many audibly &quot;identical&quot;<br/>intervals, along side of many that are either very close to lower<br/>number ratios, or ones which are altogether alien to the language of<br/>3-5 limit Just Intonation.</p><p>An initial interest and challenge toward the goal of harnessing the<br/>untapped musical forces of the Prime Series, was to devise a method<br/>by which a huge slice of the lower prime series ratios could be<br/>produced and thereby studied. I found the solution rather easy to<br/>produce. It is as follows:</p><p>I found that if one takes a small portion of the Prime Series (&quot;PS&quot;<br/>from here forth), and places it in a first column - treating it as<br/>the numerator series, then takes the same series and places it in the<br/>second column - treating it as the denominator series, then shifts<br/>the second up by one number, then the first infinite prime series of<br/>ratios is found (see below).</p><p>For purposes of discussion I will call this the &quot;First Order PS<br/>Ratios&quot;. This could best describe the series because unlike the<br/>harmonic series where there is a succession of superparticulars, here<br/>there is a &quot;lumpy&quot; series, where we begin the journey with our<br/>familiar superparticular 3/2, but quickly progress into<br/>superpartients - never to see another superparticular ratio again. As<br/>far as I&apos;m aware, there is never another occurrence of a<br/>superparticular PS Ratio beyond 3/2 (also another noteworthy quality<br/>of this ratio).</p><p>2/<br/>3/2   701.955<br/>5/3   884.358<br/>7/5   582.512<br/>11/7  782.492<br/>13/11 289.209<br/>17/13 464.427<br/>19/17 192.557<br/>23/19 330.761<br/>29/23 401.302<br/>31/29 115.458<br/>37/31 306.308<br/>41/37 177.718<br/>43/41 82.455<br/>47/43 153.988<br/>53/47 207.997<br/>59/53 185.667<br/>61/59 57.713<br/>67/61 162.422<br/>71/67 100.389<br/>73/71 48.092<br/>79/73 136.747<br/>83/79 85.510<br/>89/83 120.832<br/>97/89 149.015<br/>101/97 69.958<br/>etc.</p><p>It is helpful to imagine this series being extended into infinity, so<br/>as to internalize the fact that we are only looking at an<br/>infinitesimally small slice of the prime universe.</p><p>Now this represents a kind of series on the &quot;X&quot; axis, but let&apos;s take<br/>a look at the &quot;Y&quot;. To produce the second infinite progression of<br/>intervals, we simply move the denominator column up one more place.</p><p>This we will call this the &quot;Second Order PS Ratios&quot;, which looks like<br/>this:</p><p>2/<br/>3/<br/>5/<br/>7/<br/>11/<br/>13/7    1071.702<br/>17/11   753.637<br/>19/13   656.985<br/>23/17   523.319<br/>29/19   732.064<br/>31/23   516.761<br/>37/29   421.767<br/>41/31   484.027<br/>43/37   260.174<br/>47/41   236.444<br/>53/43   361.987<br/>59/47   393.665<br/>61/53   243.380<br/>67/59   220.135<br/>71/61   262.812<br/>73/67   148.482<br/>79/71   184.840<br/>83/73   222.258<br/>89/79   206.343<br/>97/83   269.848<br/>101/89 218.974<br/>etc.</p><p>And to obtain the Third Order PS Ratios, we slide the denominator<br/>series up one more place again, giving the below ratios:</p><p>2<br/>3<br/>5<br/>7<br/>11<br/>13<br/>17<br/>19/11    946.195<br/>23/13    987.747<br/>29/17    924.622<br/>31/19    847.523<br/>37/23    823.070<br/>41/29    599.485<br/>43/31    566.482<br/>47/37    414.163<br/>53/41    444.442<br/>59/43    547.654<br/>61/47    451.378<br/>67/53    405.802<br/>71/59    320.525<br/>73/61    310.905<br/>79/67    285.230<br/>83/71    270.351<br/>89/73    343.091<br/>97/79    355.359<br/>101/83   339.806<br/>103/89   252.921<br/>107/97   169.865<br/>109/101 131.967<br/>113/103 160.414<br/>127/107 296.661<br/>131/109 318.286<br/>137/113 333.424<br/>etc.</p><p>It becomes immediately obvious that one could go on to extend both on<br/>the x and y as far as desired (I carried it out to the 12th Order PS<br/>Ratios, and up to the first 1000 primes for my study of the PS). With<br/>this much charted above though, one can see that with each successive<br/>slide upward of the denominator column the granularity of the series<br/>becomes much greater.</p><p>The next question emanating from the reader must be: &quot;How may I form<br/>a scale from this?&quot; And the answer is that one may either employ a<br/>systematic approach to subsetting from the series, or else use one&apos;s<br/>personal taste and knowledge of tuning flavors to &quot;pick by hand&quot; from<br/>the PS web.</p><p>First, let&apos;s look at a selection of the ratios, sorted by prime limit:</p><p>3/2   701.955<br/>5/3   884.359<br/>7/5   582.512<br/>11/7  782.492<br/>13/11 289.210<br/>13/7  1071.702<br/>17/13 464.428<br/>17/11 753.637<br/>19/17 192.558<br/>19/13 656.985<br/>19/11 946.195<br/>23/19 330.761<br/>23/17 523.319<br/>23/13 987.747<br/>29/23 401.303<br/>29/19 732.064<br/>29/17 924.622<br/>31/29 115.458<br/>31/23 516.761<br/>31/19 847.523<br/>31/17 1040.080<br/>37/31 306.308<br/>37/29 421.767<br/>37/23 823.070<br/>37/19 1153.831<br/>41/37 177.718<br/>41/31 484.027<br/>41/29 599.485<br/>41/23 1000.788<br/>43/41 82.455<br/>43/37 260.174<br/>43/31 566.482<br/>43/29 681.941<br/>43/23 1083.243<br/>47/43 153.989<br/>47/41 236.444<br/>47/37 414.163<br/>47/31 720.471<br/>47/29 835.929</p><p>Below are 3 scales I created by order of prime limits (a more<br/>systematic method).</p><p>Scale #1 (Scala file: &quot;LIGON.SCL&quot;.

The sky&apos;s the limit (although here, &quot;Primes&quot; are<br/>the limit).</p><p>Many times my approach to performing on such systematically<br/>constructed scales as above, comes from the pattern creating joy of<br/>reacting to the sound under one&apos;s fingertips, on instruments of<br/>choice, where the musical focus is attuned to &quot;How I may make music<br/>with the unique qualities and moods of a particular tuning system,<br/>rather than being repelled by the numbers I see before hearing&quot;?<br/>Commas aren&apos;t a problem - they become powerful melodic elements. Wide<br/>5ths - love them! (Perhaps this comes from many years of being an<br/>improvising musician - I&apos;m always &quot;reacting&quot;.) There is something<br/>undeniably gorgeous about intervals like 29/19; an interval right at<br/>home on a metallophone timbre. There are myriad of creative<br/>compositional techniques which one can call upon to get the most out<br/>of complex tunings such as these. Things like using proper registers,<br/>and mixed timbres (stay away from the &quot;full fisted&quot; keyboard<br/>approach!), hocketing, intervallic partitioning, klangfarbenmelodie-<br/>like passing of melodic notes between timbres, singing, and extended<br/>melodies. These scales open a new door for me (and like any other<br/>tuning system one can name, it implies its own innate style); a kind<br/>of bridge between worlds of simplicity and points of complexity where<br/>ideas of limits - odd or prime - lose their meaning, and prime<br/>numbers granulate the pitch continuum in ways which are mysterious to<br/>the mind.</p><p>To conclude, I have tried these both harmonically (playing chords)<br/>and melodically as well, and they shine the most in a melodic setting<br/>to me, although on the right timbres (e.g. strings), I&apos;m able to<br/>write compelling thematic harmonies with any of the above three<br/>scales. And upon reflection from appreciating them in these different<br/>ways, I must add that they have an overall sound that is eerily<br/>beautiful and uniquely unlike any tunings I&apos;ve ever explored<br/>previously. I can only convey some vague sense of this quality<br/>through the medium of text, but suffice it to say, that it is<br/>analogous to the ineffable sensation of laying on one&apos;s back as a<br/>child, and gazing at the stars.</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
