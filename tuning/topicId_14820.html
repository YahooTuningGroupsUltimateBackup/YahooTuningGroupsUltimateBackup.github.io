Sounds like it could be a<br/>&gt; &gt;virus...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, I was thinking &quot;dice&quot;. Did you ever play Dungeons and Dragons? There<br/>&gt; were many different-shaped dice, and this would be the 8-sided die. There<br/>&gt; was a 30-sided die too, and I think that can be understood as a<br/>&gt; five-dimensional Euler genus . . . the movie is all set . . .</p><p>Paul! Not that I ever played D&amp;D, but I&apos;m quite sure it was a 20-sided<br/>dice - wasn&apos;t there one of each Platonic solid, i.e. 4-sided, 6-sided,<br/>8-sided, 12-sided and 20-sided? You can&apos;t have a 30-sided dice with all<br/>faces identical, so it wouldn&apos;t be a fair one...</p><p>Keenan Pepper wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 25<br/>&gt;    Date: Fri, 20 Oct 2000 20:06:55 -0400<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mtpepper@prodigy.net">mtpepper@prodigy.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Re: How do I triangulate an N-dim lattice?</p><p>[mildly scary stuff snipped]</p><p>&gt; Have fun!<br/>&gt; -Keenan P., who is still 13 years old (14 next week!)</p><p>yeah, but in which base?!
