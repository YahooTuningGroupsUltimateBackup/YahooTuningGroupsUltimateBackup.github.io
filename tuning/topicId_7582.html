So, Ellis (who&apos;s real name was Sharpe),<br/>determined that the Foundling Hospital organ had &quot;16 notes&quot; in the Helmholtz<br/>appendix.  This is 10 years after Bosanquet brought it up in his book, but<br/>without specificty.  Perhaps Ellis knew something more that Bosanquet did<br/>not.  Regardless, I found that PITCH I:4 bibliography listed &quot;14&quot; for Handel<br/>based solely on Bosanquet.  Perhaps that was a subconscious reason for my<br/>making a fuss.</p><p>As for relying on editions of Handel or any other composer, I guess I am less<br/>trusting than others on the list.  My Ives readings, replete with passionate<br/>cries against editors changing his notation, makes me a tad suspicous.  And<br/>Ives was alive and could be consulted!</p><p>BTW, Could someone recommend a stellar recording of Handel in extended<br/>meantone?  What piece would be a good one to present in that regard?  Hmn?</p><p>I just turned up that Werckmeister was virulent against Handel&apos;s split-key<br/>extended meantone philosophy.  He wrote in his 1691 treatise - Musical<br/>Temperament - that &quot;One may make 100 or 1000 subsemitones on a keyboard so<br/>the togetherness of the harmony still is and remains weak,&quot; probably because<br/>he didn&apos;t like the meantone model for its regularly flat fifths.</p><p>Later in the same work, Werckmeister wrote in conclusion at the top of<br/>Chapter 28  (Concerning the temperament as a whole) that &quot;all major thirds<br/>have to be tempered upwards from their fundamental pitch.&quot;  This is exactly<br/>how Marpurg quoted Kirnberger pertaining to J.S. Bach.  And here,<br/>specifically in the context of Werckmeister temperament by the Author himself.</p><p>Werckmeister concludes Chapter 26 with &quot;Those who dare to make subsemitones<br/>on organs, instruments, lutes, etc. are stuck in a big mistake, act against<br/>nature, and want to be smarter than God.  The 1/4 tones are a lot of<br/>imperfect work and only make weak sounds etc.&quot;  (ouch!)</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
