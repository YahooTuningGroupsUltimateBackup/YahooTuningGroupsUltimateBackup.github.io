I spend the better part of my working days with orchestra and opera musicians, and while the pin-headed attitudes that you speak of exist in spades, it certainly doesn&apos;t help to have someone from the populist/world music circle (such as yourself) exhibit the same kind of behavior in the other direction. I don&apos;t know how many others around here feel the same way about music, but I find value in so very many of the worlds musical cultures, including and outside of Western classical music. I try to not shut *any* doors, and I value the contributions of the &apos;educated&apos; and &apos;folk&apos; musician alike.</p><p>Case in point: my favorite birthday presents recently? Toss-up between the complete Shostakovich string quartets (Emerson Qtet) and the Buddah Records reissue of Woodie Guthrie&apos;s &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot;.</p><p>But then again, my Razor scooter rules...</p><p>Chilling,<br/>Jon</p></div>
