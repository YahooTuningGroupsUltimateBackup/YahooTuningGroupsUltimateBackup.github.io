There is no tonality in pentatonic music.</p><p>Tonality comes from the introduction of two halfsteps which extend pentatonic in two different direction: harmonic (above C = B) and subharmonic (under C = F). These are tension notes and the subharmonic one (F) gives much more tension than the harmonic (B).</p><p>Tonal groups in major tonality are so defined:</p><p>Tonic: chords without tension notes or with the less tense (B), I VI III<br/>Subdominant: chords with more tension (F), IV II<br/>Dominant: chords with both tension notes (tritone), VII V</p><p>From this explanation, the dominant triad would not be in the dominant group and actually, without the dominant seventh, the V-I progression could be considered as a I-IV.</p><p>MINOR TONALITY</p><p>In my experience it does&apos;nt exist a natural minor *tonality* while exist an eolian modal context.<br/>A minor tonality derives from the introduction of G# in eolian mode. This note gives a lot of tension more than the previous two (B and F) since it appears beyond a chain of seven perfect fifths which is the normal diatonic area. For this reason G# is used mainly in chords which stay in a diatonic context, E7 and G#&deg;, while chromatic chords (as defined in my previous post) are less used: AmM7, Cmaj/#5.<br/>Tonal groups in minor tonality are:</p><p>Tonic: chords without tension notes or with the less tense (B), I III<br/>Subdominant: chords with more tension (F), IV VI<br/>Dominant: chords with maximum tension (G#), V VII</p><p>Bm7/5b is a special chord since it contains a lot of tension (tritone) which resolve on 3 and 5 of the tonic but without G# which would resolve on 1. So I feel this chord stay between dominant and subdominant group.</p><p>BOTH</p><p>In both major and minor tonality (C and Am) five chords remain in the same group:</p><p>Tonic:Cmaj7 Am7<br/>Subdominant:Fmaj7 Dm7<br/>Dominant:G7 (G#&deg;7)</p><p>Two chords change tonal group:</p><p>Bm7/5b loose some tension and pass from dominant to subdominant/dominant<br/>Em7 pass from tonic to dominant (E7).</p><p>Also I don&apos;t know nothing about traditional harmony regarding tonal groups in minor tonality and I would like to have some information about it.</p><p>Ciao</p><p>Lorenzo</p></div>
