How to say that? You&apos;re getting me in doubt about the purpose<br/>of well-temperaments. I always thought that their main goal was to allow<br/>playing in all the keys with only 12 tones per octave (that means all the 12<br/>fifths to be more or less usable). But I&apos;m not so sure this one also works<br/>like that. It was just the first time I saw the scale when I found an<br/>evidently unusable fifth of G-D (this needs no detailed analysis) which is a<br/>syntonic comma smaller than the pure 3/2. If a scale like this is considered<br/>a well-temperament, then another such &quot;well-temperament&quot; may be a scale that<br/>has 10 pure fifths, one fifth a schisma smaller, and one fifth a syntonic<br/>comma smaller. Indeed, Scala calls such a scale a &quot;well-temperament&quot;.<br/>Someone may argue that the syntonic comma can be used as a unison vector. Of<br/>course, but that means to distribute it in more than one fifth. I would<br/>consider a fifth mistuned even if it was only 1/2 syntonic comma smaller. I<br/>don&apos;t know the exact definition of &quot;well-temperament&quot;. But if such a scale<br/>is allowed to be called like this, then there must be something inaccurate<br/>or wrong about it. Perhaps others know better?<br/>Petr</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2004 1:34:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi, Monz!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What a beautiful, beautiful tuning!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is the most equal 12-tone superparticular scale and it is<br/>&gt; &gt; relatively low-numbered as a fragment of harmonic series too.

How to say that? You&apos;re getting me in doubt<br/>&gt; about the purpose of well-temperaments. I always thought that<br/>&gt; their main goal was to allow playing in all the keys with<br/>&gt; only 12 tones per octave (that means all the 12 fifths<br/>&gt; to be more or less usable). But I&apos;m not so sure this one<br/>&gt; also works like that. It was just the first time I saw the<br/>&gt; scale when I found an evidently unusable fifth of G-D (this<br/>&gt; needs no detailed analysis) which is a syntonic comma smaller<br/>&gt; than the pure 3/2. If a scale like this is considered<br/>&gt; a well-temperament, then another such &quot;well-temperament&quot;<br/>&gt; may be a scale that has 10 pure fifths, one fifth a schisma<br/>&gt; smaller, and one fifth a syntonic comma smaller. Indeed,<br/>&gt; Scala calls such a scale a &quot;well-temperament&quot;.</p><p>hmm ... that might be a distincition worth making in the<br/>name.  perhaps &quot;well-temperament&quot; *should* be restricted to<br/>a tuning in which all &quot;5ths&quot; are &quot;usable&quot;.</p><p>i&apos;ve always thought of well-temperaments in pretty much<br/>the same way as Carl: &quot;perturbations from 12-ET&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Someone may argue that the syntonic comma can be used<br/>&gt; as a unison vector. Of course, but that means to distribute<br/>&gt; it in more than one fifth.</p><p>only if it&apos;s a *vanishing* unison-vector!</p><p>the unison-vector need not vanish by being distributed<br/>... it can also be a sudden disruption in the JI lattice,<br/>which is exactly what happens when the syntonic comma<br/>is not distributed.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2004 2:34:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Scala tells us it is epimorphic for {2,3,5,17,19}, and gives<br/>&gt; the mapping &lt;12 19 28 * * * 49 51| for it.
