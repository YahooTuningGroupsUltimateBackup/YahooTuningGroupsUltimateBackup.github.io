Korean music<br/> is some of the best and always to me one of the best illustration of how ornament such as vibrato and pitch bending can be used tastefully. It surpasses the blues and i hear a lot of it is Partch&apos;s music, more than japanese or chinese.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: Alison Monteith &lt;<a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Microtonality at the Edinburgh Festival 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Added to this there are five nights of &quot;Pansori&quot; a traditional Korean<br/>&gt; artform combining storytelling and music. I would expect something corporeal<br/>&gt; in the Partchian sense of the word. The action is driven by two master<br/>&gt; percusssionists (wearing the distinctive costumes and strange hats) and a<br/>&gt; singer/actor. Performances range from 2 - 5 1/2 hours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
