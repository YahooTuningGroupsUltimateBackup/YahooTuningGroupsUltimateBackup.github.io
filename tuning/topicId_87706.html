It&apos;s related to inconsistency.</p><p>Another regular mapping idea is that the tuning follows from the<br/>mapping.  Once you temper out enough commas to get an equal<br/>temperament, the scale steps will be roughly equal.  And if you apply<br/>a rank 2 mapping to an equal temperament, you&apos;ll naturally end up with<br/>an MOS.  That&apos;s one reason the mappings are so important.  Whether the<br/>exact tuning is equally tempered, a rank 2 TOP, or a JI periodicity<br/>block is less important than knowing what mappings apply.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 2:13:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &quot;Homogeneity&quot; means &quot;all the same&quot;.</p><p>Yes, but do you mean it in the sense that the structure is the same in any key?</p><p>&gt; Yes, regular mappings are where it&apos;s at.
