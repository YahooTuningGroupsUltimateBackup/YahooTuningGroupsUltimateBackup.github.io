Phillip does<br/>not have email, so I will email you his postal address. It has been<br/>quite a few years since I&apos;ve worked with the canons, so the following<br/>is with a grain of salt...</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; From your knowledge, have any of the three designs proved to be<br/>&gt; superior to the others ( I like the look and design of no.III )?</p><p>Not really (HC I is a very different instrument, but you must know<br/>that already). The photos of HC II don&apos;t exactly show that where the<br/>tuning pegs are, and where you can see open space, is because HP had<br/>metal pieces made to hold the tuners, which gave stiffness to the<br/>tension area. But the canons made for HC III weren&apos;t showing too much<br/>bowing after a number of years. As I recall, they were all similar in<br/>regards to their acoustical power. I will drop a line to Dean<br/>Drummond to get his thoughts about this as well...</p><p>&gt; And secondly I seem to remember something about the mandolin tuning<br/>&gt; pegs being a bit unreliable over time. What&apos;s the latest<br/>&gt; thinking on this? High quality geared guitar pegs would seem to me<br/>&gt; to be the best option.</p><p>Latest thinking? :) Well, I&apos;m willing to bet that anything outside of<br/>the most cheaply made tuners (pegs) these days would be superior! In<br/>truth, the tuning machine mechanisms on the stringed instruments were<br/>not of very high quality, and good tuners will work out just fine.<br/>The difficulty of the design is in the limited physical space to get<br/>at the knobs when tuning (and *especially* when changing a string).<br/>There may well be some &apos;alternate&apos; style tuners available where the<br/>tight space could be designed around.</p><p>I&apos;ll dig up Phillip&apos;s address (probably tomorrow) and forward that to<br/>you.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
