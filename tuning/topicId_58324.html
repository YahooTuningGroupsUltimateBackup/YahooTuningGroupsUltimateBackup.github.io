I find this a very dull sport.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know why you want to become personally insulting. Since you<br/>&gt;seem bent on maintaining the misconceptions drilled into you by<br/>&gt;teachers who themselves did not know much about tuning on a list<br/>&gt;*devoted* to tuning, you are not in a very good position to start<br/>&gt;throwing spitballs if that is what it is coming to. I suggest you<br/>&gt;start by learning the tuning basics, such as what 7-limit chords are<br/>&gt;and what they actually sound like, before dismissing the idea that a<br/>&gt;septimal interpretation of some common practice chords, as well<br/>&gt;apparently as some Wagner chords, makes a lot of sense.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I said &apos;a quite strong dissonance&apos;, which in British English, my<br/>&gt; &gt;native language, means &apos;somewhat strong&apos;. Possibly it may mean<br/>&gt; &gt;something else in American. In any case, it is correct, because the<br/>&gt; &gt;German 6th may resolve onto a dominant 7th, which is itself a mild<br/>&gt; &gt;dissonance. The fact that this *is* a resolution implies that we are<br/>&gt; &gt;not in ET, since if we were, there would be no difference between a<br/>&gt; &gt;dominant 7th and a German 6th.</p><p>&gt;Yes, we&apos;ve covered this. I think your terminology is unfortunate and<br/>&gt;confusing here, but obviously you like it, so why not move on?</p><p>Mr. Dent is using the standard terminology of traditional theory/harmony. His usage is not in any way eccentric, incorrect or confusing to anyone familiar with pre-20th c. music theory. A chord which in a traditional tonal context needs to be resolved is a dissonance. For example, read Grove&apos;s &quot;Beethoven &amp; his Nine Symphonies&quot;, he refers to dominant sevenths as dissonances.<br/>Sorry for butting in, but it gets really tedious wading through endless arguments based on willful misunderstandings, or refusals to understand, of what people say.</p><p>Chris</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

It is not only inherently coinfusing, it had both of us, and<br/>certainly Dent is included in this, confused. I mentioned The German<br/>sixth as an example of what can only be interpreted as a septimal<br/>chord from the common practice period. Dent responded that it was a<br/>strong dissonance, and the French sixth even stronger. In context,<br/>since we were talking about *psychoacoustical* dissonance, and since<br/>the French sixth is indeed a harsher chord, this clearly carried an<br/>implication that the French sixth was psychoacoustically rather<br/>dissonant (which is true) and the German sixth somewhat less so (at<br/>best confusing; the chords are not really comperable<br/>psychoacoustically, only in terms of  functional harmony and<br/>nomenclature.)</p><p>&gt;A chord which in a traditional tonal context needs to be resolved is<br/>a dissonance.</p><p>I know that, dammit.

So far so good, but then comes the discussion<br/>of the French sixth, with an augmented fourth in place of a fifth, as<br/>therefore being a &quot;more extreme&quot; dissonance that the German sixth.
