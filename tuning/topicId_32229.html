This is accomplished<br/>with a _punctus divisionis_ or &quot;dot of division&quot; which shows that a<br/>group of notes together have the value of a breve, literally the<br/>&quot;short&quot; unit, and divide it as might be said in modern theory into<br/>n-tuplets.</p><p>Around 1325, Jacobus of Liege points to this ability to divide the<br/>breve into 5 or 7 (or in theory 9) equal parts as an advantage of the<br/>Ars Veterum of &quot;Art of the Ancients&quot; (i.e. the generation of his<br/>youth) in contrast to the Ars Nova of the early 14th century, which<br/>directly recognizes only divisions of 2 or 3.</p><p>There are a number of means used in late medieval notation to indicate<br/>polymeters or irregular grouping of various kinds, for example:</p><p>        (1) The Petronian _punctus divisionis_, which<br/>            can divide the breve into an equal group of<br/>            3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 notes, with the divisions<br/>            of 5 and 7 occurring in actual late 13th-century<br/>            pieces;</p><p>        (2) The regular mensurations of the 14th century and<br/>            later -- 9/8, 3/4, 6/8, and 2/4 in modern notation --<br/>            which can be alternated in one voice or mixed in<br/>            different voices;</p><p>        (3) Syncopation, termed by Willi Apel &quot;insertion<br/>            syncopation&quot; or &quot;displacement syncopation,&quot;<br/>            in which for example one might take the notes<br/>            for the first 5 units of a 6/8 measure, then<br/>            then continue for some 6/8 measures from that<br/>            point, eventually supplying the odd eighth-note<br/>            unit to get this voice &quot;back in synch&quot; with the<br/>            others. A related technique would permit odd<br/>            groups of 3/8 or 5/8, etc., to alternate freely<br/>            in a given voice -- this may not be a very<br/>            precise explanation, but it should give some<br/>            general idea;</p><p>        (4) Proportions, sometimes with the same name as<br/>            those defining interval ratios, such as<br/>            _sesquialtera_ (3:2), permitting such things<br/>            as singing 9 notes in one voice against 4 in<br/>            another.</p><p>These techniques seem to reach their height in the _Ars subtilior_ or<br/>&quot;14th-century Manneristic period&quot; in the decades of about 1370-1410,<br/>although there are some vivid echoes in the early music of Guillaume<br/>Dufay (1397?-1474), often viewed as a key transitional figure between<br/>Gothic and Renaissance eras.</p><p>There are also some later Renaissance techniques recalling these: the<br/>&quot;mensuration canons&quot; of the era around 1500 where a single melody<br/>might be sung by several voices, each with its own mensuration,<br/>forming a concordant whole; and also occasional divisions by odd<br/>factors such as 5 or 7. Juan del Encina around 1500 has a piece, a<br/>&quot;jazzy&quot; one I would say, with rhythms of 5; and as late as 1597,<br/>Thomas Morley includes in his _Plain and Easy Introduction to<br/>Practical Music_ a piece including proportional divisions of 5 and 7.</p><p>In response to the &quot;Harmonic Evolution&quot; discussion, I might caution<br/>that prime limits are only one aspect of a more complicated process,<br/>in 1200 or 1500 or 1900 or 2002.</p><p>As a medievalist, I would not surprisingly emphasize that simply<br/>looking at the highest prime (or odd) factor in the most complex<br/>stable sonority gives a very partial view of musical technique.<br/>Having expressed this opinion, I would like to suggest several factors<br/>to be considered in considering changes in vertical or harmonic and<br/>intonational style:</p><p>        (1) The development of progressions contrasting unstable<br/>            and stable sonorities, with considerations such as<br/>            smooth melodic motion as well as vertical variety;</p><p>        (2) The tendency of urgent cadential sonorities or<br/>            &quot;discords&quot; in one era to become &quot;relatively<br/>            concordant&quot; or &quot;floating&quot; sonorities in the next,<br/>            complete stable sonorities in the next after that,<br/>            and &quot;incomplete&quot; forms of some more complex stable<br/>            sonorities in some following era;</p><p>        (3) The role of cadential efficiency as well as vertical<br/>            &quot;euphony&quot; (as regarded in a given stylistic context)<br/>            in possibly favoring certain intonational changes;</p><p>        (4) The possible factor of categorical perception in<br/>            the treatment of new interval types as &quot;concords&quot;<br/>            or &quot;discords&quot; of whatever degree; and</p><p>        (5) The harmonic and melodic potential of intervals<br/>            arising in a given tuning system fortuitously, as<br/>            it were.</p><p>Knowing that discussions of this kind can get a bit abstract, and<br/>wanting to follow what I might call the Szanto Axiom of keeping this<br/>relevant to my own musical experience as well as that of others, I&apos;ll<br/>try to develop some of these themes from a certain first-person<br/>viewpoint, drawing also on the first-person accounts of other<br/>musicians.</p><p>First of all, the question is often not whether one can theoretically<br/>describe a given ratio, but whether at a given moment it &quot;fits in&quot;<br/>with one&apos;s musical style -- or maybe is just there in a tuning and<br/>is hard to resist using in the context of one&apos;s stylistic inclination.</p><p>For example, around 1325, Jacobus of Liege discusses ratios of 5 and<br/>7, notes that instruments could be built using such intervals, and<br/>demonstrates both the 81:80 and 64:63 commas. However, he concludes<br/>that such intervals are not in practical use because they cannot be<br/>generated from the proper steps of Pythagorean intonation.</p><p>In 1998, I had a specific reason to use ratios of 7 such as 9:7, 7:6,<br/>12:7, 7:4 and 8:7 in a neo-medieval style: they would permit more<br/>efficient cadential resolutions to stable fifths, fourths and<br/>octaves. It is not that the usual Pythagorean intervals are less than<br/>excellent for this task, only that a set of even more efficient<br/>cadences using new ratios very much appealed to me.</p><p>One response I got in Tuning List discussions was a certain puzzlement<br/>that I would use these ratios of 7 as unstable, like their Pythagorean<br/>counterparts, rather than regard them as stable, since they are small<br/>integer ratios and _could_ be treated as stable.</p><p>Here it may be a matter of taste rather than acoustical imperative:<br/>similarly I tend to treat 0-277-738-1015 cents or 0-462-738-923 cents<br/>in 13-tET as an unstable sonority resolution to 0-738 cents or<br/>0-738-1200 cents, although there is no reason why the first two<br/>sonorities might not be treated as conclusive.</p><p>Returning to the theme of cadential efficiency, one might ask whether<br/>the popularity of the 4:5:6:7 intonation of the 18th-19th century<br/>dominant seventh chord could reflect not only a tendency toward<br/>greater &quot;euphony&quot; or &quot;concord&quot; (as it does for Euler in 1764), but<br/>also a more efficient two-voice resolution from the smaller 5:7<br/>diminished fifth to a major third at or near 4:5, with a compact 20:21<br/>semitone.</p><p>However, my own musical experience makes me regard the appeal of<br/>certain ratios as an open question: I find that I like a &quot;tritonic&quot;<br/>interval at or near either 5:7 (e.g. 29-tET) or 8:11 (e.g. 22-tET) in<br/>progressions where this interval moves by parallel motion to a stable<br/>fifth (or sometimes fourth) in a medieval fashion.</p><p>Shifts toward the use of a given interval category in freer or more<br/>&quot;floating&quot; treatments may or not be accompanied by intonational<br/>shifts, and trying out different permutations can be a fine approach<br/>for creating new music.</p><p>For example, I find that early 15th-century fauxbourdon, the use of<br/>parallel sixth sonorities with a lower third and upper fourth, can be<br/>very pleasing in a standard 14th-century Pythagorean tuning, or in a<br/>modified early 15th-century scheme where thirds involving sharps are<br/>often realized as near-5 &quot;schisma thirds&quot; (or &quot;skhismic thirds&quot; as<br/>Helmholtz/Ellis would spell the term), or using ratios of 3 and 7.</p><p>In addition to urging this kind of experimentation, where tastes may<br/>certainly differ, I would look to the accounts of xenharmonicists who<br/>describe their own experiences with new tunings, for example Nicola<br/>Vicentino (1555) and Fabio Colonna (1618) in exploring their 31-note<br/>divisions of the octave into equal or near-equal fifthtones.</p><p>Categorical perception may play a role in Vicentino&apos;s remarks, for<br/>example, that a near-11:9 third is rather concordant, but an interval<br/>we would describe as near 7:6 or 7:4 more dissonant. From a<br/>16th-century viewpoint, a &quot;seventh&quot; generally is a dissonance, and a<br/>small seventh at 7:4 fits this pattern -- as I also noted when<br/>listening to this interval in a 16th-century kind of context. In a<br/>14th-century kind of setting I might find it more &quot;mellow&quot; or<br/>&quot;relatively concordant,&quot; and indeed Guillaume de Machaut uses minor<br/>sevenths more freely than in typical 15th-16th century practice.</p><p>Thus &quot;harmonic evolution&quot; need not follow set patterns: Vicentino can<br/>find 11:9 more concordant than 7:6 or 7:4. The first interval<br/>apparently better fits his categorical concept of a &quot;concordant third&quot;<br/>of some kind. In contrast, the 7:6 tends toward a dissonant second,<br/>while the 7:4 suggests a kind of more-or-less dissonant seventh.</p><p>For me, sometimes, I suspect that musical context can influence<br/>categorical perception: &quot;If it _acts_ like a minor third, it is to a<br/>certain extent a &grave;minor third,&apos; or &grave;quasi-third.&apos;&quot; This happens in<br/>20-tET when I resolve a 240-cent interval to a unison by contrary<br/>motion.</p><p>Sometimes changes in concepts of stability or &quot;concord/discord&quot; may<br/>occur without any obvious changes in intonation. For example, in<br/>12-tET, a sonority of 0-400-700-900 cents or &quot;added-sixth chord&quot; is<br/>inherently unstable in a Classic-Romantic style, but often conclusive<br/>in certain 20th-century styles.</p><p>My own inclination is to focus on the role of complex as well as<br/>simple intervals and ratios, and to seek a subtle continuum of<br/>concord/discord.</p><p>In my view, much of the creative process involves not so much &quot;moving<br/>up the harmonic series&quot; as discovering the wealth of materials, often<br/>unexpected ones, in a given type of tuning, for example when carried<br/>to more notes.</p><p>Thus while meantone tunings were developed, possibly around the<br/>mid-15th century, to provide simple diatonic scales and modes with<br/>approximate ratios of 3 and 5, by 1555 two fortuitous resources (among<br/>many others) had been noted by Vicentino in his 31-note cycle: the<br/>availability of new kinds of intervals such as &quot;proximate minor<br/>thirds&quot; near 11:9; and the melodic step of the enharmonic diesis<br/>(e.g. G#-Ab) or fifthtone.</p><p>As has often been remarked here, standard Western European keyboard<br/>tunings tend to have a note of &quot;regularity,&quot; from medieval Pythagorean<br/>to Renaissance/Manneristic meantone to the _mildly_ irregular<br/>well-temperaments and the isotropic geometry of 12-tET.</p><p>However, dramatic asymmetry (as measured against the &quot;geometry&quot; of<br/>one&apos;s own usual expectations) can be a very stimulating variant. For<br/>example, 13-tET has excellent minor thirds and major sixths at 277<br/>cents and 923 cents which could be the pride of any neo-medieval<br/>tuning system -- but no usual major thirds or minor sixths. It has<br/>fine submajor thirds (369 cents) and supraminor or &quot;Phi&quot; sixths (931<br/>cents), but no supraminor thirds or submajor sixths like those found<br/>in regular temperaments in the general neighbhorhood of 704 cents.</p><p>There is also the charm of ambiguity, as with the 5-step interval of<br/>13-tET, which nicely serves in appropriate timbres as the equivalent<br/>of a medieval fourth and also of a large cadential major third<br/>expanding to a fifth.</p><p>Intonational structure makes possible, but does not necessarily<br/>compel, certain stylistic choices. For example, in a 31-note meantone<br/>structure like that of Vicentino following or approximating 31-tET,<br/>one might follow a conventional style based on 16th-century ratios of<br/>3 and 5; or a 20th-century technique (anticipated, for example, by<br/>Euler) of seeking combined ratios of 3, 5, and 7; or a kind of<br/>&quot;Neo-Gothic/Xeno-Renaissance&quot; style favoring now ratios of 3 and 5,<br/>and now ratios of 3 and 7, with some Vicentino/Colonna enharmonic<br/>idioms featuring fifthtone motions or shifts.</p><p>There is another kind of question: Can concepts based on &quot;n-limit&quot;<br/>harmony apply to a range of tempered systems, or might it be better to<br/>speak in categorical interval terms: &quot;Minor sevenths and major seconds<br/>are often treated as relatively or even conclusively concordant in a<br/>range of 20th-century sonorities.&quot;</p><p>We can also imagine alternate histories where certain stylistic<br/>changes _might_ have been accompanied by intonational ones. For<br/>example, suppose that the Debussyian exploration of more complex<br/>&quot;floating&quot; harmonies around 1900 had been followed in the next decades<br/>of the 20th century by the widespread adoption of Busoni&apos;s 36-tET,<br/>with a focus on the near-pure ratios of 3 and 7 making possible such<br/>sonorities as 0-267-700-967 cents (very close to a just 12:14:18:21).</p><p>Such alternate histories should be not only an opportunity for<br/>reflection, but an instigation to action.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=32240 href="#32240">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2002 3:26:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

On neutral and supermajor thirds, here&apos;s an excerpt from<br/>Book V Chapter 8, pp. 336-8 of the Maniates translation</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>There are also two other kinds of thirds that can be used, even though<br/>they do not have the just measurement of the others.  Nonetheless, they<br/>can be employed more readily in playing than in singing, because the<br/>minute difference between the third we normally use and those we shall now<br/>adopt is not audible if players do not linger on them.  It may be argued,<br/>moreover, that if totally dissonant seconds and sevenths are used, the<br/>proximates of the minor and major third are much more serviceable, since<br/>they seem consonant when newly composed on the archicembalo.</p><p>If a player fails to pay attention to the proximate and most proximate<br/>consonances, he will be deceived by them, for they are so proximate to<br/>imperfect consonances that they seem identical to them.  Thus, when<br/>playing the archicembalo, you may use the third larger than the minor<br/>third, that is, the proximate third that is one minor diesis larger than<br/>the minor third.  This step resembles the major third without being a<br/>major third, and the minor third without being a minor third.  The minor<br/>third we use below the low A la mi re [1A] is the second G sol re ut<br/>[2F#].  Its proximate is on the third F fa ut on the fourth rank [4F+],<br/>and it seems better than the minor third because it is not as weak as the<br/>minor third in comparison to the major third.  Still, the proximate is<br/>somewhat weaker then the major third because it is smaller by one<br/>enharmonic diesis.  thus, the proximate or most proximate to the minor<br/>third sounds acceptable and can be played.  I believe that some people<br/>sing proximate and most proximate thirds as they sharpen these minor and<br/>major consonances when performing compositions, and they do not create<br/>discords despite the fact that the former are not the same size as the<br/>latter.</p><p>Moreover, the same thing happens with the proximate to the major third,<br/>which seems to be both a major third and a fourth without being either.<br/>This proximate third is less tolerable to the ear than the proximate of<br/>the minor third.  The reason is that the minor third itself moves toward<br/>the major third so that its proximate tends toward this good thirds,<br/>whereas the proximate of the major third moves toward the fourth as if<br/>tending toward a dissonance.  Thus, the proximate of the minor third below<br/>A la mi re [1A] is the third F fa ut in the fourth rank [4F+], and the<br/>proximate of its major third is the second F fa ut in the third rank<br/>[3E#].  Its fifth is D sol re [1D].</p><p>In addition, there are two other new consonances that occur in the same<br/>way: the proximate and most proximate of the major and minor sixth.  Just<br/>as the minor sixth below A la mi re [1A] is located on the second D sol re<br/>[2C#] and its proximate on the third C fa ut in the fourth rank [4C+], so<br/>the major sixth below A la mi re [1A] is the first C fa ut [1C], and the<br/>third C fa ut in the fourth rank [4C+] has its proximate below A la mi re<br/>[1a[ which is the second C fa ut in the third rank [3B#].  The latter<br/>proximate is harsh, for it tends toward the seventh.  But it is salvaged<br/>by its sixth.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>I use + in place of the superscript dot for raising by a minor diesis.<br/>&quot;Proximate&quot; means enlarge by such a diesis, and &quot;most proximate&quot; by a<br/>comma, whatever that might be.

As I view it, the question of the usual &quot;proximate thirds&quot;<br/>is the easier one to address, since his descriptions seem nicely to<br/>fit either a 31-note cycle of 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET, and these<br/>intervals do not involve the more problematic &quot;comma keys.&quot;</p><p>The question of the comma keys and the second tuning might seem a bit<br/>more disputable, since I&apos;m not aware of any of his music where he<br/>expressly indicates &quot;comma&quot; as opposed to diesis alterations. One<br/>might guess that he optionally left such refinements to a skilled<br/>player -- as one would lead adaptive tuning or JI in a usual<br/>16th-century vocal piece to the performers of flexible-pitch<br/>instruments, writing in a notation which could also show the steps on<br/>a fixed-pitch meantone instrument.</p><p>As you observe, the question of the &quot;most proximate&quot; intervals<br/>involving commas also involves this question of interpretation, and I<br/>would be inclined to read them as varying by a &quot;half-diesis&quot; from the<br/>regular ones -- an interval close to a syntonic comma.</p><p>At the same time, Paul, I would say that the familiar interpretations<br/>of Vicentino&apos;s first and second tunings still seem very attractive to<br/>me. The most likely reservation I might have here is that in the first<br/>tuning, the comma keys _might_ have been tuned in accordance with<br/>either of the leading interpretations of a &quot;comma&quot; -- either the<br/>amount by which the fifth is tempered (a 31-note meantone cycle plus a<br/>few notes in adaptive JI), or the &quot;half-diesis&quot; reading (resulting,<br/>for example, in a few near-Pythagorean intervals).</p><p>Addressing first the usual &quot;proximate&quot; intervals, I might also say<br/>something more about the way that Vicentino and Zarlino, although<br/>strongly disagreeing on some basic issues regarding the chromatic and<br/>enharmonic genera in polyphonic music (an understatement, one might<br/>say), seem to take similar approaches to the fourth. Since Vicentino<br/>ties the &quot;proximate major third&quot; to the fourth, this point may be<br/>relevant.</p><p>Both Vicentino and Zarlino take the fourth from one point of view as a<br/>&quot;perfect consonance&quot; grouped with but after the fifth -- an approach<br/>standard around the 13th century, when 3:2 and 4:3 are often ranked<br/>together as &quot;intermediate concords&quot; (a term used by Zarlino also).<br/>Interestingly, both of them apply the Renaissance rule against<br/>parallel &quot;perfect concords&quot; to fourths as well as octaves and fifths,<br/>although Vicentino characteristically recognizes an exception in<br/>theory, and it would interesting to see how strictly he follows his<br/>general recommendation against parallel fourths in practice.</p><p>At the same time, both Vicentino and Zarlino recognize that as a<br/>simple interval or dyad -- or interval directly above the bass -- the<br/>fourth is generally treated rather cautiously in practice, somewhat in<br/>the manner of a discord. Between upper voices, it is a concord in<br/>practice as well as theory. Thus the interval has an ambivalent<br/>status.</p><p>Let us know consider the usual &quot;proximate&quot; thirds of Vicentino, the<br/>ones involving diesis but not comma modifications, as I interpret them<br/>in 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET:</p><p>     7/5-tone     8/5-tone      9/5-tone      10/5-tone     11/5-tone</p><p>   minimal 3rd   minor 3rd      proximate     major 3rd     proximate<br/>                                minor 3rd                   major 3rd<br/>     [~7:6]       [~6:5]     &quot;~5-1/2:4-1/2&quot;    [~5:4]    &quot;~4-1/2:3-1/2&quot;<br/>                                 (~11:9)                      (~9:7)</p><p>    min3 less                    min3 plus                  maj3 plus<br/>     diesis                       diesis                     diesis</p><p>From Vicentino&apos;s perspective, the minimal third is too small to have a<br/>concordant &quot;thirdlike&quot; flavor, tending toward the dissonance of the<br/>major second as judged by 16th-century standards. The minor third is<br/>the smallest third to give satisfying concord. The &quot;proximate minor<br/>third,&quot; whose ratio he gives as approximately 5-1/2:4-1/2 (i.e. 11:9)<br/>is rather concordant, and &quot;tends towards&quot; to the ideal concord of the<br/>major third, which he like Zarlino finds more joyful as a simultaneous<br/>consonance.</p><p>He finds that the proximate major third near &quot;4-1/2:3-1/2&quot; or 9:7<br/>tends rather toward dissonance, or toward the ambiguous status of the<br/>fourth. Actually, it is in some ways more &quot;discordant&quot; than the<br/>fourth, which is routinely used as a full concord between the _upper_<br/>voices of a sonority while the proximate major third remains more of a<br/>special effects interval either in conventional practice (where the<br/>diminished fourth is sometimes boldly used) or in Vicentino&apos;s style.</p><p>These categories nicely fit either 1/4-comma meantone or the very<br/>similar 31-tET. Also, if one reasonably concludes that Vicentino&apos;s<br/>melodic enharmonicism dividing a chromatic semitone into two dieses<br/>(e.g. C4-C*4-C#4) calls for an equal or near-equal division, then<br/>these tunings (41.06-34.99 or 38.7-38.7 cents) would fit this<br/>requirement.</p><p>Here it&apos;s only fair to note, on the diesis question, that<br/>unconventional views (proposing something other than 1/4-comma<br/>meantone or 31-tET) can be found in the literature. Thus Mark Lindley,<br/>in one article from the 1980&apos;s, suggested a kind of 31-note<br/>well-temperament, based in part on Vicentino&apos;s remarks about the<br/>_second_ tuning.</p><p>However, let&apos;s assume that we take an equal or near-equal 31-note<br/>division as the basis for the first tuning -- apart from the question<br/>of what to do with the five remaining &quot;comma keys&quot; on his 36-note per<br/>octave keyboard.</p><p>As you observe, Graham, Vicentino does make an observation about a<br/>kind of major third equivalent to the Pythagorean, which would not be<br/>&quot;blunted.&quot; Is it possible that here he is suggesting that from a<br/>melodic viewpoint, the full 81:64 ditone (or the close approximation<br/>of a major third plus his &quot;half-diesis&quot; comma, say 5:4 plus 20.53<br/>cents or 406.84 cents if we calculate a diesis at 128:125) is ideal<br/>for melody, although the 5:4 is required for stable vertical concord?</p><p>Anyway, however he might have disposed the five &quot;comma keys&quot; in his<br/>first tuning -- and Maniates and Palisca in fact treat them as<br/>&quot;half-diesis&quot; keys 1/62-octave higher than their unmodified<br/>counterparts (e.g. C-E&apos;3 near 81:64) -- his description of his second<br/>or &quot;just fifth&quot; tuning in his 1555 and 1561 treatises suggests to me<br/>as well as to other interpreters that his &quot;comma&quot; equal to the<br/>temperament of the fifth (~1/4-comma) is the one likely intended.</p><p>Vicentino says that this tuning features &quot;perfect fifths&quot; and &quot;perfect<br/>thirds&quot; sounding together (1561), and that suggests to me the pure<br/>ratios based on 5 rather than the Pythagorean ratios (which to<br/>Vicentino and Zarlino cannot sustain harmonic concord).</p><p>Also, if one takes &quot;perfect thirds&quot; to mean 5:4 and 6:5, then this<br/>could be taken as implying a regular temperament specifically of<br/>1/4-comma meantone for each manual (ideally both having 19 notes in<br/>Gb-B# a &quot;comma&quot; apart, and on his actual instruments having 19 and 17<br/>notes respectively). Then each manual would have regular &quot;perfect&quot; 5:4<br/>thirds, with the 3:2 fifths and 6:5 minor thirds supplied by the<br/>&quot;comma&quot; (i.e. 1/4-comma) adjustments between the manuals.</p><p>Canvassing the literature, I have found that Vicentino is ambiguous<br/>enough to have suggested a range of hypotheses -- for example, one<br/>creative author connected Vicentino&apos;s &quot;just fifth&quot; with the near-pure<br/>fifth which in fact results if we tune 31 notes in 1/4-comma meantone,<br/>where the &quot;odd&quot; fifth will be about 6.07 cents wider than the others<br/>(which are tempered by about 5.38 cents in the narrow direction).</p><p>With the first tuning, I find an arrangement of the first 31 notes in<br/>1/4-comma or 31-tET to fit his theory and music, including the matter<br/>of the usual &quot;proximate intervals.&quot; Deciding how to interpret the<br/>&quot;comma keys&quot; could go in two directions.</p><p>Like Bill Alves and some others, I find the &quot;comma as 1/4-comma&quot;<br/>reading very attractive: it would provide some optional pure concords<br/>for a few comma diatonic sonorities often appearing in prolonged<br/>durations at the end of a composition or section where pure intonation<br/>might be especially striking. Here I mean &quot;pure intonation&quot; in<br/>16th-century terms, with 4:5:6 or 10:12:15 sonorities.</p><p>The &quot;half-diesis&quot; division maybe seems to me a bit more &quot;antiquarian.&quot;<br/>While it might nicely fit a kind of mixed &quot;Gothic-Renaissance&quot; style<br/>of the kind I enjoy cultivating myself, I don&apos;t see any avowed<br/>tendencies of this kind in Vicentino. Maybe it&apos;s a bit like Ugolino of<br/>Orvieto&apos;s suggestion that to his 17-note Pythagorean keyboard -- an<br/>MOS keyboard, in Wilsonian terms (Gb-A#) -- one might add two notes<br/>dividing E-F and B-C into equal dieses in the ancient Greek manner,<br/>although he remarks that this is not used in modern (i.e. early<br/>15th-century) practice.</p><p>In deciding which interpretation _might_ be more musically likely --<br/>and I agree, Graham, that certain remarks of Vicentino can raise a<br/>real possibility of more than one &quot;solution&quot; -- I would consider his<br/>remarks defining modern music as _musica mista e participata_, that is<br/>&quot;mixed and tempered.&quot;</p><p>Both what he describes as a &quot;mixture&quot; of genera (i.e. the use of steps<br/>from the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera), and the<br/>tempering of the fifth in order to get more concordant thirds and<br/>sixths, are basic traits for him of common practice as well as his own<br/>fifthtone music.</p><p>Possibly, as you suggest, Graham, Vicentino himself may not always<br/>have had a single interpretation for those &quot;comma keys&quot; -- maybe he<br/>wanted to show how they _could_ be used to emulate Pythagorean thirds,<br/>a feature one noted ancient system of tuning (the half-diesis<br/>reading). Whether he would have tuned them this way in his first<br/>tuning, some or all of the time, remains an open question.</p><p>Graham and Paul, I would say that the use in Vicentino&apos;s notated music<br/>of the diesis but not the comma, as far as I am aware, makes the<br/>latter concept (and its implementation in his tunings) somewhat more<br/>problematic. The 1/4-comma hypothesis might fit his 1561 treatise, and<br/>also my own musical intuition -- but we are indeed dealing with<br/>probabilities and interpretations, much as when performing<br/>16th-century music and deciding which accidental inflections to add.</p><p>Here scholarly humility is well called for: as astute a commentator<br/>and musician as Bill Alves has set an example by remarking that a<br/>cycle in 1/4-comma meantone seems a &quot;probable&quot; interpretation, and<br/>that the &quot;comma as 1/4-comma&quot; is one reading for Vicentino&apos;s &quot;comma<br/>keys.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
