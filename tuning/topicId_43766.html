It is<br/>hard for us to believe that it has been almost four years since such a<br/>cargo has passed through our gates.  Yet time moves differently there<br/>than here as this live field recording can testify to. So here you have<br/>it.</p><p>THE STOLEN STARS: AN ANAPHORIAN DANCE DRAMA.</p><p> Inside the CD you get the background and history of this ritualistic<br/>drama, so we will refrain from repeating what is printed there. Instead<br/>we include some comments on the music from one of Anaphoria&apos;s most<br/>renowned ethnomusicologists, Lovogata Lubati, who not only suggested the<br/>recording but also was instrumental in bringing it to completion:</p><p>&quot;Musically this dance drama exploits the properties of one of<br/>Anaphoria&apos;s most prized tunings with its capacity to create subtle<br/>standing waves. The sound produced, while being totally acoustic,<br/>resembles certain electronic effects. Phase shifting, beat patterns that<br/>accumulate into their own complementary tempos, and the play on brain<br/>wave patterns are all natural products inherent in the nature of the<br/>tuning and instruments. Different tempos also unfold between the three<br/>instrumental groups as they are separated at some distance to<br/>accommodate the dance that requires an unusually large area. It is for<br/>this reason it became ideal to use three different recording engineers<br/>placed at optimum positions.&quot;</p><p>More information available at <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a> and from<br/><a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a></p><p>While distribrution is still being set in order, one can purchase for a<br/>prelease price for $12 (that includes shipping add $1 for out of US)<br/>made out to:</p><p>Kraig Grady<br/>2645 Crestmoore Pl.<br/>L.
