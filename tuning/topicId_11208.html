Since some of you seem<br/>to be pretty familiar with the system, I thought you might have an answer<br/>to this question.  He introduces the idea of efficiency by saying that an<br/>efficient musical language is one which can form the greatest number of<br/>distinct words (ordered sequences of tones) given the number of notes in<br/>the scale.  The way I interpret this comment is that, for instance, two<br/>augmented triads, C E G# and D F# A# (both 444), are not distinct words.<br/>The calculation succeeds at what it is clearly meant to do: distinguish<br/>asymmetrical proper scales with high stability such as the diatonic scale,<br/>from symmetrical scales with higher efficiency (although much less common<br/>in practice) such as the whole tone and octatonic scales.  However, it<br/>gives the highest efficiency rating to scales which seem intuitively closer<br/>to symmetrical scales, such as C E F# G# A#.  This scale contains<br/>indistinct 4 note subsets E F# G# c and G# A# c E (2244), indistinct 3 note<br/>subsets C E A#, E F# A# and F# G# c (246), subsets E F# c, G# A# e, and A#<br/>c f#, (264) and so on.  But it is because of this property of the scale<br/>that it recieves a high efficiency rating (it always takes 5 notes to<br/>distinguish the scale from one of its transpositions), relative to the<br/>anhemitonic pentonic, which contains more distinct 2, 3 and 4 note subsets.<br/> I must be interpreting &quot;distinct words&quot; incorrectly, in which case the<br/>question becomes, how should we think of the distinctness of pitch<br/>sequences as Rothenberg defines it, and what is the value of that way of<br/>looking at it?</p><p>jason</p></div><h3><a id=11211 href="#11211">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2000 11:57:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, Jason!</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m using David Rothenberg&apos;s pitch perception calculus in a thesis I&apos;m<br/>&gt;working on and am having a little difficulty with exactly what property of<br/>&gt;scales the efficiency quantity is meant to capture.</p><p>I&apos;m a casual observer of Rothenberg&apos;s material.  I&apos;ll try my best to<br/>communicate my view of things.  I&apos;m doing this from memory, but at the very<br/>least it should be something to chew on.</p><p>&gt;He introduces the idea of efficiency by saying that an efficient musical<br/>&gt;language is one which can form the greatest number of distinct words<br/>&gt;(ordered sequences of tones) given the number of notes in the scale.</p><p>Efficiency is defined as the average length of a scale&apos;s sufficent sets<br/>(in terms of the length of the entire scale).  The greater this value, the<br/>greater the number of distinct words which contribute _key information_ to<br/>the listener.</p><p>&gt;The way I interpret this comment is that, for instance, two augmented<br/>&gt;triads, C E G# and D F# A# (both 444), are not distinct words.</p><p>?  Are not distinct words of what scale?  Perhaps you meant &quot;sufficient<br/>sets&quot; instead of &quot;distinct words&quot;?</p><p>&gt;The calculation succeeds at what it is clearly meant to do: distinguish<br/>&gt;asymmetrical proper scales with high stability such as the diatonic scale,<br/>&gt;from symmetrical scales with higher efficiency (although much less common<br/>&gt;in practice) such as the whole tone and octatonic scales.</p><p>One could explain efficiency as a measure of this type of symmetry.<br/>Overtly, efficiency is a measure of how much information the listener needs<br/>to determine what key (and thus, what mode) of the scale a melody is in.<br/>For scales where this symmetry is low, the listener may find his place<br/>after only a few scale members are heard.  As this symmetry goes up, more<br/>and more motivic material is required for the listener to locate the<br/>frequencies he hears on the rank-order matrix.  Rothenberg implies that<br/>some of the fun of melody is playing around in this area -- melodies may<br/>make puns as to which key they belong, and so forth.  And eventually, says<br/>R., when the symmetry is total, it&apos;s entirely up to the melody to guide<br/>the listener into an interpretation of what tonic is being used.</p><p>&gt;However, it gives the highest efficiency rating to scales which seem<br/>&gt;intuitively closer to symmetrical scales, such as C E F# G# A#.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>In fact, since sufficient sets are not defined for scales with perfect<br/>modal symmetry (like the whole tone scale), neither is efficiency defined,<br/>and I can see an argument for calling it zero in these cases.  But by R.&apos;s<br/>reasoning (above), 1.0 is probably more intuitive: seeing efficiency as how<br/>much work the melody will have to do to fix the tonic.</p><p>&gt;This scale contains indistinct 4 note subsets E F# G# c and G# A# c E &gt;(2244), indistinct 3 note subsets C E A#, E F# A# and F# G# c (246),<br/>&gt;subsets E F# c, G# A# e, and A# c f#, (264) and so on.  But it is because<br/>&gt;of this property of the scale that it recieves a high efficiency rating<br/>&gt;(it always takes 5 notes to distinguish the scale from one of its<br/>&gt;transpositions), relative to the anhemitonic pentonic, which contains<br/>&gt;more distinct 2, 3 and 4 note subsets.</p><p>I assume you meant &quot;insufficient&quot; instead of &quot;indistinct&quot;.</p><p>&gt;I must be interpreting &quot;distinct words&quot; incorrectly, in which case the<br/>&gt;question becomes, how should we think of the distinctness of pitch<br/>&gt;sequences as Rothenberg defines it, and what is the value of that way of &gt;looking at it?</p><p>Substituting &quot;sufficient&quot; for &quot;distinct&quot;, you&apos;re pretty much on target.</p><p>Importantly, says R., proper scales can participate both in this<br/>key-guessing fun, which results from having lots of insufficient words,<br/>and in scale-degree tracking fun.  But improper scales can only participate<br/>in scale-degree tracking fun, and so will be most desirable when efficiency<br/>is _low_ (so scale-degree tracking can begin as soon as possible).  Proper<br/>scales will be best when efficiency is high, but still functional when it<br/>is low.</p><p>I think it&apos;s important to keep in mind that with Rothenberg&apos;s model, we<br/>address everything in terms of the _entire scale_.  We&apos;re used to this<br/>kind of thinking, with 5- and 7-tone scales found the world over, where<br/>all the tones are &apos;on hand&apos;, and the entire scale functions as a unit.<br/>But improper scales have proper subsets!  I believe that worthwhile<br/>composition can also be done on large, microchromatic scales, where<br/>melodies are played locally, and the sense of a global source set is<br/>non-existent.  In fact I believe this has been done with 12-tET in this<br/>century.  Rothenberg&apos;s model still applies, to local events, but the<br/>usefulness of the model at this scale (ahem!) is questionable, IMO.</p><p>Let me know if you can make sense out of any of this,</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
