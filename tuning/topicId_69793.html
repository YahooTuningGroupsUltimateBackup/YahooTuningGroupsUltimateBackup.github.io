This is an addition of succesive bridge<br/>commas, and so we may express everything in 13-limit marvel in terms of<br/>5-limit intervals, and then temper by 166-et to get the marvel<br/>tempering. The 5-limit approximations then are</p><p>7 ~ 225/32<br/>11 ~ 4096/375<br/>13 ~ 324/25</p><p>All of these, of course, are exact equivalences in 166.</p></div>
