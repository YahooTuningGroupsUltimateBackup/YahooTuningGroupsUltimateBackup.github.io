It does seem quite the hybrid.</p><p>Whew! Well, let&apos;s make this very concrete. To me, JI is desirable<br/>only because it gives you the consonant intervals exactly. This is<br/>why a JI lattice, where the &quot;rungs&quot; are consonant intervals, is so<br/>useful. Meantone is desirable because it gives you the consonant<br/>intervals almost exactly, and a finite meantone system allows you to<br/>chain them together in ways which a finite JI system doesn&apos;t. Either<br/>way, it is the _consonant intervals_ which should be the &quot;rungs&quot;<br/>or &quot;basis vectors&quot; of the lattice. Furthermore, whether the meantone<br/>system _happens_ to have some far-flung intervals _exactly_ as they<br/>are in JI (as in 1/6-comma meantone, or any n/m-comma meantone, where<br/>n and m are integers) or doesn&apos;t (as in Golden Meantone, or<br/>LucyTuning, or 55-tET) should have essentially _no_ effect on how the<br/>lattice looks, let alone on the question of whether the lattice can<br/>or cannot be produced at all!</p><p>&gt; Second question: (with all due respect to personal beliefs, and the<br/>&gt; First Amendment&apos;s guarantee of &quot;freedom of existential thought&quot;):<br/>&gt; WILL THE (mathematical) STATE NOT ...LATTICE..ARRAY (let us..pray)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SHALL WE ALLOW A &quot;MATHEMATOCRACY&quot; (even our own) TO DENY US OUR<br/>&gt; VISUAL INTUITIVE DELIGHTS (which may possess visually and semi-<br/>&gt; sonically functional, albeit  mathematically &quot;irrational&quot;,<br/>&gt; integrity)? It is understood that *seeing* is not *hearing*... :)</p><p>Everyone is free to indulge in their own mathematical flights of<br/>fancy. My interest is in the _practical_ end of things -- what is<br/>most enlightening for the actual creation of music. Joseph Pehrson is<br/>presently composing using a lattice for a certain tuning system, so<br/>he, for one, can attest to the _practical_ utility of a lattice. Many<br/>JI composers have also employed lattices -- witness, for example, the<br/>nice big 7-limit lattice in David Doty&apos;s _Just Intonation Primer_;<br/>Ben Johnston&apos;s lattice where the factors of 3 are vertical rather<br/>than horizontal; and so on. What makes these useful is this property,<br/>call it &quot;L&quot;:</p><p>L: One can locate immediately all the pitches bearing audible,<br/>consonant relationships with other pitches. The pitches consonant<br/>with one another tend to be close to one another, while pitches<br/>dissonant with one another tend to be further from one another.</p><p>Now tempered systems, such as meantone, are also based on consonant<br/>intervals, but these intervals are tempered so that combinations of<br/>them can lead back to the starting pitch (allowing for a finite set<br/>of meantone pitches to stand in for an infinite set of JI pitches).<br/>Whether can be shown by an actual rolled-up cylinder or by repetition<br/>in the lattice. But what seems essential to me is that, given the<br/>system&apos;s ultimate basis in consonant intervals, property L should<br/>hold!</p><p>As an example, take 1/4-comma meantone temperament. If I were a<br/>composer seeking a lattice that would be of practical utility in my<br/>task, I would want a lattice that showed a pair of pitches separated<br/>by an interval of a fifth or a third as close to one another; while a<br/>pair of pitches separated by a major second would be further apart.</p><p>There&apos;s an article by Donald E.
