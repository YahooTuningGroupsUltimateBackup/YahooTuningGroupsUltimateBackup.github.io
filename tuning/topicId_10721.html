Pierre discovered that<br/>property in ~&eacute;his research &lt;<a href="http://www.aei.ca/plamothe/asymtrie.htm">http://www.aei.ca/plamothe/asymtrie.htm</a>&gt; on<br/>music and harmony.<br/>Let&apos;s associate with any irreducible fraction p/q the number W(p/q) = 1/pq -<br/>its width. The property discovered by Pierre states that the sum of widths<br/>of all fractions in any row of the Stern-Brocot tree equals 1! We can easily<br/>see that this is true for a few first rows: . . .&quot;<br/>I have been conducting similar research on music and harmony, and &quot;widths&quot;<br/>of ratios, but have focused more on Farey series and the like. Is there any<br/>way I can find out more about how you&apos;ve applied your concepts to music? I&apos;m<br/>very excited to learn more!<br/>-Paul Erlich</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2000 11:08:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Pierre wrote me back -- everyone, check out these amazing web pages<br/>in French:</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/asymetrie.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/asymetrie.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/gammes-gsp.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/gammes-gsp.htm</a></p><p>On the first page, Pierre shows the stern-brocot tree applied to<br/>harmonic ratios and even points out the golden ratio in the tree. It<br/>appears he uses Tenney&apos; harmonic distance (though he doesn&apos;t call it<br/>that) as a complexity function -- I&apos;m very hopeful this will all be<br/>of great interest to me (once I get throught the French) and many of<br/>the others of you out there.</p></div>
