For me, personally,<br/>the beginning of your composition is VERY striking.  It really holds the<br/>attention... a little like a retuned Bohuslav Martinu!  Really great.  I<br/>have a little trouble after the first 40 seconds...  do you think you<br/>might consider a little more &quot;overlay??&quot;  There are also lots of stops<br/>and starts... a little like Hindmith without the epoxy.  The ending<br/>veers a little too much toward the &quot;traditional&quot; for my taste.  Even<br/>though it&apos;s &quot;retuned&quot; it still is possible to go the &quot;cliche&quot; route<br/>without intending it!</p><p>Also, I have no idea why you included the &quot;unretuned&quot; version.  It has<br/>no correspondence to the real piece...  Etrange.</p><p>I bet you&apos;re sorry now you asked for comments!  Anyway, we&apos;re not<br/>supposed to be discussing composition or music on this list, only<br/>intonation....</p><p>Oh, I be bad.  Wield the knife, crew....<br/>___________ ________ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
