I say this because if they *had* used it consistently, the result would have been to what Martin Vogel refers as &quot;comma shifts&quot; in any music except that which is the most simple-simon harmonically.  Comma shifts are a real problem of using JI in an a cappella context, because they usually result in a lowering of overall pitch placement.</p><p>Take, for example, a simple chord succession (I know, this is a tonal example, but I think the same sort of thing would occur in a modal context) like I - IV - ii - V - I, rendered in 5-limit JI.  If we measure the tonic pitch as 1, this means the submediant pitch in the IV and ii chords must measure 5/3; fine so far, but then in order for the supertonic to form a just fourth with the submediant in the ii chord, it has to measure 10/9, rather than the 9/8 that this pitch is &quot;supposed&quot; to be.  The tonic and dominant of the final I chord end up being too low by the syntonic comma as well, measuring 80/81 and 40/27 respectively.  Sing through these chords just 4 or 5 times in a row in literal just intonation, and you&apos;ll discover that the final I chord is a full half-step lower than the beginning one.</p><p>I would like to suggest, Mr. Monzo, that singers have historically (consciously or unconsciously) taken 5-limit JI as an intonational ideal, but in practice have tempered some intervals (especially melodic, rather than harmonic, ones) slightly in order to prevent comma shifts from causing pitch to drop lower...and lower...and lower...</p><p>Of course, there is the possibility that early singers didn&apos;t care if their pitch was dropping, in which case just intonation could have been used more consistently.  In any case, it&apos;s doubtful that it has ever been used that accurately, seeing as perfect intonation is unattainable in an imperfect universe.  :P</p><p>Oh, one more note.....personally, I don&apos;t see the value of performing plainchant in just intonation.  The big advantage of JI is how pretty it makes _simultaneously held_ pitches sound.  I mean, I can see how it might be used in early polyphony, such as organum, where you have long-held simultaneities, but performing monophony in JI, even in a highly-reverberant cathedral,  seems like a fairly pointless endeavour to me, except perhaps as some sort of carnival stunt.  And then, of course, there&apos;s still that potential comma shift problem...</p><p>Thanx for listening,<br/>Dale Scott<br/>Austin, Texas</p></div><h3><a id=3372 href="#3372">ðŸ”—</a>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>6/7/1999 8:14:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul Erlich, posting as Brett Barbaro, TD 206.7]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And it *is* possible to perform plainchant in a JI scale with<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *every* note consonant with those already being heard<br/>&gt; &lt;etc. - big snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, I meant the seconds would be dissonant no matter what.</p><p>OK - I already conceded to Margo that consideration of the<br/>dissonance of the &apos;2nds&apos; got past me.</p><p>[Dale Scott, TD 206.13]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr. Monzo,<br/>&gt; concerning the use of just intonation in early a cappella vocal<br/>&gt; music, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The significant compositions were purely vocal, *perhaps*<br/>&gt;&gt; accompanied by the organ, and when not accompanied, were<br/>&gt;&gt; presumed to be in performed in just-intonation; _a cappella_,<br/>&gt;&gt; it *couldn&apos;t* be anything else but JI!<br/>&gt;&#x9;(...)<br/>&gt;&gt; Given the fact that I believe 5-limit JI was used in practice<br/>&gt;&gt; by 1300 (and perhaps long before that), that leaves *at least*<br/>&gt;&gt; two and a half centuries during which, I would argue,<br/>&gt;&gt; unaccompanied singers routinely used 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While it is only natural, owing to the structure of the human<br/>&gt; psyche, that a cappella singers gravitate toward just-tuned<br/>&gt; intervals, and while it is quite probably true that early singers<br/>&gt; used 5-limit JI &quot;routinely,&quot; it is doubtful to me that they could<br/>&gt; have used it _consistently_.</p><p>Please note that I said &apos;routinely&apos; but never said &apos;consistently&apos;.</p><p>I suppose it was a poor choice of words to use<br/>&quot;it *couldn&apos;t* be anything else but JI!&quot; to express my thought.</p><p>[Scott]<br/>&gt; I say this because if they *had* used it consistently, the result<br/>&gt; would have been to what Martin Vogel refers as &quot;comma shifts&quot; in<br/>&gt; any music except that which is the most simple-simon harmonically.</p><p>I&apos;ve already ackowledged this in the past; it&apos;s not a matter<br/>of opinion, it&apos;s mathematical and acoustical fact.</p><p>[Scott]<br/>&gt; Comma shifts are a real problem of using JI in an a cappella<br/>&gt; context, because they usually result in a lowering of overall &gt; pitch<br/>placement.</p><p>This, however, is an opinion, and I disagree.
