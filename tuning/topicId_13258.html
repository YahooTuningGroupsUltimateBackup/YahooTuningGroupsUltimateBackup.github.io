If anyone wants to respond to anything *I&apos;ve* said, do it to me offlist, as to not waste the time of the list at large. I post this mainly so no one feels the need to accuse me of ducking the issues or quitting. I&apos;m just escaping to a work project.</p><p>On the entry page to the eGroups Tuning List, the following appears:</p><p>&quot;This mailing list is intended for exchanging ideas relevant to alternate tunings: just intonation; paratactical tunings; experimental musical instrument design; non-standard equal temperaments; MIDI tuning system exclusive specs; concert postings; gamelan tunings and other non-western tunings; historical tunings; the experimental tunings of Harry Partch, Lou Harrison, Martin Bartlett, James Tenney, and so on; software reports; recordings; books; research sources, etcetera.&quot;</p><p>I include, implicitly in that etcetera, the discussion of music made with said alternate tunings. If anyone wants to re-focus the masthead, fine.</p><p>Wishing you all good health,<br/>Jon...</p><p>...who regrets whatever role he had in bogging down the ongoing quest...</p></div>
