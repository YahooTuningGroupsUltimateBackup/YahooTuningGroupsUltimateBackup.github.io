It was so beautiful and I began falling asleep.<br/>For a moment, I _saw_ the music. It was a mountain range in the distance. I<br/>can&apos;t explain it now, but at that moment I knew I wasn&apos;t seeing an image<br/>associated with the music . . .

You sound to me like a person who would<br/>make a great musician. I think you&apos;ll find that, if you really commit<br/>yourself to it, you&apos;ll be able to express yourself so much more fully<br/>through music than anyone ever could through words.</p></div>
