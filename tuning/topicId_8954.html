First, I found the unison, and then<br/>measured what intervals I could get by singing sharp.  The first one that<br/>locked-in was a 7:6.  This surprised me, because I&apos;d been getting it<br/>before through trying to sing unisons, and had no idea it was so wide.</p><p>Then, by narrowing the interval, guided by the Spectrogram readout, I<br/>found another lock at something like 15:14 (I can&apos;t say precisely, but it<br/>was wider than 16:15) and then 10:9.  When widening to get a third, I<br/>found the first thing I hit was a 9:7 and then the 4:3.  As I have poor<br/>(pretty much non-existent) relative pitch, I wasn&apos;t recognising these as<br/>thirds or fourths or anything.</p><p>It was actually quite difficult to get the 5:4, but once I did it was<br/>obvious that it was purer than the 9:7.  (I think, although it locks<br/>strongly, there&apos;s only a very small pitch range for which does so.)  Then<br/>I tried to see what intervals locked in-between.  I found an interval<br/>around 409 or 410 cents (I had upped the precision by now) kept arising,<br/>and also the occasional 400 cent one.  There was no other pattern, and<br/>certainly no preference for 404-5 cents.  Although there was quite a bit<br/>of vibrato, so where this led from 400 to 409 cents, you could have nailed<br/>the average pitch at 404.5 cents.  409 cents is good for 19:15.</p><p>Finding the 6:5 was even harder, partly because of the pull of the 7:6.</p><p>The experiment Jerry suggested was to sing against the root, and then add<br/>the fifth.  Guided by the readout, I found a 5:4, then shut my eyes and<br/>added the fifth.  By opening my eyes, I could then follow the trace to see<br/>what I had been singing.  Three phenomena were observed:</p><p>1) I held the note constant.  One way of doing this was to concentrate on<br/>the note I was singing, and ignore the new one coming from the keyboard:)<br/>Otherwise, it did sound like the note I was singing rose.  I attribute<br/>this to the increased amount of high-pitched sound reaching my ears.</p><p>2) The pitch really did rise.  This tended to be to around 9:7 or 19:15,<br/>or some inconsistent point around 400 cents.</p><p>3) Upward vibrato was added, classically resulting in the pitch<br/>fluctuating between 5:4 and 9:7.</p><p>By consciously correcting for the sharpening, I even hit some kind of<br/>neutral third once:)</p><p>At that point, the high third theory seemed confirmed.  Then, a while<br/>later, I realised that, as I had been using the soundcard synth, setting<br/>the tuning on my synth keyboard would have had no effect.  So I had been<br/>tuning the fifths to golden meantone.  I then repeated this experiment,<br/>and found that the pitch did alter when the fifth was added, but not in<br/>any consistent direction.  I interpret this as meaning that there is an<br/>optimum amount of beating that I was seeking out.</p><p>But why would a flat fifth have encouraged me to sharpen the third?  I&apos;m<br/>not sure, but it may have increased the pull towards the 7:6 with that<br/>fifth, as well as creating a region of ambiguity between locking with the<br/>root and fifth.  Another thing is that I may have been trying too hard to<br/>get the right results:)</p><p>My general conclusion is that the third is much harder to lock than a<br/>fourth or fifth, let alone a unison or octave.  So, it&apos;s the most likely<br/>note to go out of tune in a triad.  It also notices less if it&apos;s out of<br/>tune in a chord, as the consonance between the root and fifth is still<br/>there.  In addition, if the fifth is even slightly out of tune, it gets<br/>much harder again to get the third right.  The maxim &quot;better sharp than<br/>flat&quot; then leads to a high third.  The fact I did sometimes hit 400 cents<br/>also suggests 12-equal conditioning.  I don&apos;t know if this is stronger<br/>than normal in me because, although I&apos;m a keyboard player of sorts, I&apos;ve<br/>been mostly using meantone for a couple of years now.  This may explain<br/>where all the 7-prime limit intervals came from.</p><p>So there you go.  Completely unscientific, but I hope interesting none the<br/>less.</p><p>                         Graham<br/>              <a href="http://x31eq.com/">http://x31eq.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=8999 href="#8999">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/29/2000 10:34:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed reported:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I sat down with Spectrogram last night so that I could measure what pitch<br/>&gt; I was singing against a drone.</p><p>Graham, bless your British heart for taking me up on my suggestion to<br/>explore the world of &quot;ear tuning.&quot; Needless to say, I have read your<br/>adventure with keen interest. So, if I may, I&apos;ll offer a few comments.</p><p>&gt; First, I found the unison, and then<br/>&gt; measured what intervals I could get by singing sharp.

I think this &quot;subminor<br/>third&quot; (thanks, Tuning List) is the one blues singers hear when they sing<br/>the &quot;blue third.&quot; I am a bit surprise that you had been &quot;getting it&quot; by<br/>trying to sing unisons. I don&apos;t quite understand that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, by narrowing the interval, guided by the Spectrogram readout, I<br/>&gt; found another lock at something like 15:14 (I can&apos;t say precisely, but it<br/>&gt; was wider than 16:15) and then 10:9.</p><p>Didn&apos;t get to 8:9? That&apos;s pretty easy to hear.</p><p>&gt; When widening to get a third, I<br/>&gt; found the first thing I hit was a 9:7 and then the 4:3.  As I have poor<br/>&gt; (pretty much non-existent) relative pitch, I wasn&apos;t recognising these as<br/>&gt; thirds or fourths or anything.</p><p>How did you get past the 4:5? That&apos;s the most easy to hear in that vicinity.<br/>Interesting. Perhaps you didn&apos;t go slowly enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was actually quite difficult to get the 5:4, but once I did it was<br/>&gt; obvious that it was purer than the 9:7.  (I think, although it locks<br/>&gt; strongly, there&apos;s only a very small pitch range for which does so.)</p><p>Oh, good. Yes, I agree that the 4:5 locks very securely to a sounding root.</p><p>&gt; Then<br/>&gt; I tried to see what intervals locked in-between.  I found an interval<br/>&gt; around 409 or 410 cents (I had upped the precision by now)</p><p>Meaning you had become more exacting in your judgements?</p><p>&gt; kept arising,<br/>&gt; and also the occasional 400 cent one.  There was no other pattern, and<br/>&gt; certainly no preference for 404-5 cents.  Although there was quite a bit<br/>&gt; of vibrato,</p><p>Uuuuugh!

Vibrato is definitely not good for this kind of<br/>research.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure, but it may have increased the pull towards the 7:6 with that<br/>&gt; fifth, as well as creating a region of ambiguity between locking with the<br/>&gt; root and fifth.

Actually, I stopped practicing for a long time because I was in a<br/>flat with thin walls, and I&apos;m bashful about these things.  But yes, I&apos;d<br/>eventually arrive in the general vicinity of the note I was supposed to be<br/>singing, but sometimes lock into a note I knew to be sharp.  I assumed it<br/>was some kind of quartertone, but turns out it&apos;s a subminor third.</p><p>When I try to tune my guitar by ear, I find it&apos;s very difficult to tell if<br/>the same note played on two different strings is tuned the same.  However,<br/>it&apos;s a lot easier when I play a tune and alternate the notes.  So I&apos;ve<br/>obviously built up some idea of melody over the years.  So I must have<br/>some kind of relative pitch, but I can&apos;t put names to intervals.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then, by narrowing the interval, guided by the Spectrogram readout, I<br/>&gt; &gt; found another lock at something like 15:14 (I can&apos;t say precisely,<br/>&gt; &gt; but it<br/>&gt; &gt; was wider than 16:15) and then 10:9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Didn&apos;t get to 8:9? That&apos;s pretty easy to hear.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m surprised at how difficult it is to sing.  As soon as I get<br/>sharper than 10:9 I slide into a 7:6.  I think I did get it last night,<br/>although the differences are very small.  I think I was singing a neutral<br/>second as well, somewhere around 150 cents.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When widening to get a third, I<br/>&gt; &gt; found the first thing I hit was a 9:7 and then the 4:3.

What&apos;s that?</p><p>Between major and minor.  I&apos;m doing a fair amount of work with neutral<br/>third scales, and would like to be able to sing them.  I think the<br/>interval I got here was somewhere between 6:5 and 11:9, although I didn&apos;t<br/>hold it for long enough to be that interested.</p><p>Last night, I tried singing a tune with neutral thirds either doubling on<br/>the keyboard, or singing to chords.  I think I got it, although I haven&apos;t<br/>measured the results.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So, it&apos;s the most likely<br/>&gt; &gt; note to go out of tune in a triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assuming there is a &quot;right&quot; tuning for the third.</p><p>As I was trying to get the cleanest sound, that should have been the<br/>5-limit.  That&apos;s certainly been my experience with keyboard tunings.<br/>Otherwise, I think the optimum mistuning depends on the timbre.</p></div>
