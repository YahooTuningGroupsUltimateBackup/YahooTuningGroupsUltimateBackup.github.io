Joshua Pierce will be featured on<br/>synthesizer simulating either piano or pipe organ as asked by Prof. Code.  He<br/>told me that Eivind Grovin (who had correspondence with Partch),<br/>unfortunately missed the synthesizer (1901-1974).  In addition to pieces with<br/>2 Symphonies and a Piano Concerto, Grovin&apos;s microtonal works are for his<br/>specially designed keyboards and Norwegian Folk Vocalist (microtonal by<br/>implication), and some for a flute that plays harmonics (to the 15th).  The<br/>tuning is based on pure just thirds and fifths.</p><p>The Partch performances in Bergen (2 of them) seem to be the first<br/>performances ever Norway (Li Po selections and Dark Brother).  One<br/>journalist, Nicholas Molkorhaug, did a radio interview for Norwegian National<br/>Radio featuring my album Raven with discussion on Partch and Ives.</p><p>Also fascinating is Sigbjorn Apeland, harmonium performer (get his album<br/>&quot;Fryd&quot; on Jossa Jazz label VJ 98004-2)  Fantastic microtonal music based on<br/>the still-not-fully explained microtonality of Norwegian folk music.<br/>Sigbjorn heard the 2nd performance we did in Hakonshalle and thought we had a<br/>fantastic harmonium.  He hadn&apos;t realized it was electric because of his seat,<br/>but he commented twice that a true harmonium couldn&apos;t play the technical<br/>demands of &quot;Dark Brother&quot; as well.  He loved the tone and thought we had<br/>sampled it.  (It is a Proteus designed to simulate the chromelodeon by Henry<br/>Lowengard, who that lends us the instrument for performances.)</p><p>Now to finalize programming for the AFMM&apos;s 20th Anniversary.  Concerts Sept.<br/>29, Oct. 18, and Nov. 2nd in New York this spring.  Information to be updated<br/>next week on our web site.</p><p>Best to all.
