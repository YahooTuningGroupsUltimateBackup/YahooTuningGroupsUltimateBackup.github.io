This is an issue I intend to<br/>examine as best as I can, but no time for more words today.<br/>(Even though it is implied in the following discussion.)</p><p>M. Schulter wrote:<br/>&gt; [first quuoting Paul Erlich]<br/>&gt; &gt; Certainly in the case of 9:12:16, I would say that, for most<br/>&gt; &gt; musically useful timbres and registers, the 16:9 minor seventh is<br/>&gt; &gt; already too complex a ratio to be perceptibly worsened by<br/>&gt; &gt; mistuning. Instead, bringing it any distance (in this case, halfway)<br/>&gt; &gt; towards 7:4 only improves its concordance.  Meanwhile, the two<br/>&gt; &gt; perfect fourths are only tempered by 1/4 of a septimal comma. As a<br/>&gt; &gt; result, this two-stacked-fourths chord (and for similar reasons,<br/>&gt; &gt; chords of three stacked fourths) sounds very pleasant in &quot;pure 9:7<br/>&gt; &gt; hypermeantone tuning&quot;, or the virtually identical 22-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is another good question: does the pleasant effect of 9:12:16 in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean derive in part from the pure 16:9 minor seventh, or simply<br/>&gt; from the two pure fourths? How about the role of the 9:8 in 4:6:9?<br/>&gt; Do stylistic expectations or settings influence these questions?</p><p>Q: are there any other simple proportions approximate to 9:12:16 --<br/>that is, any other way to fine-tune D-G-C? A: I cannot find any.<br/>In the dualistic approach, the two alternative interpretations of<br/>this combination are (a) undertones of D and (b) overtones of C.</p><p>I interpret the &quot;pleasantness&quot; of 9:12:16 -- also the fact<br/>that we can fine tune it by ear as a chord -- as an indication<br/>of a whole that is larger than its parts.</p><p>This effect cannot be unconditional, of course. It depends<br/>on which overtones are musically significant in one&apos;s cognitive<br/>setup (I will return to this in another message), on the harmonic<br/>profiles of the tones, on whether the listener&apos;s perception is<br/>moderated by a model scale or a system of scales (processing tones<br/>&quot;categorically&quot;) -- I bet the list expands easily.</p><p>With a tempered system of tuning, I see two plain options wrt 9:12:16.<br/>Because there is no neigboring simple proportion, either one assumes<br/>that the effect of this proportion remains, or that only intervals<br/>and no sonorities are relevant. In other words, one can assess how<br/>well does a tuning system serve the one or the other approach.</p><p>A third, more perplexing approach would be to assume both approaches<br/>(whole-sonorities and interval-networks) as valid in this case,<br/>therefore a transistion from tuning &quot;9:12:16&quot; to the tempered one<br/>(which moves the outer ratio closer to 7/4) would effect a change<br/>of function, therefore a more serious matter. I do not think that<br/>this is the case (imho, should I add).</p><p>&gt; In a 7-limit setting with stable tetrads, sonorities built from three<br/>&gt; stacked fourths in 22-tet would (as you point out in your article<br/>&gt; also) have a special appeal because of the near-pure 7:6 (or its<br/>&gt; octave) as the outer interval of D3-G3-C4-F4, or example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a complex 3-limit setting, I wonder how this would compare with the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean 27:36:48:64, which I have found quite pleasant. If<br/>&gt; Japanese gagaku uses basically pure fifths for its vertical<br/>&gt; sonorities, then such sonorities would occur quite often.</p><p>This is what I, too, vaguely remember about gagaku -- it would not be<br/>hard to find out. However, I have not found either a theoretical or an<br/>experimental grace in (or about) 27:36:48:64, yet. I have played four<br/>tones, varying continuously two of them; result: nothing special about<br/>the above proportion. Actually the sonority got more &quot;interesting&quot;,<br/>albeit more Gesualdo-like, as I contracted the total interval.<br/>(Might it be  C-D-F = {1/8 : 1/7 : 1/6} (common overtone C) with a<br/>drone G?)</p><p>Three writers, three views.

Well, I do.</p><p>I only had this particular case in mind, not postulating a general rule.<br/>To test this matter in earnest, show me a short progression to try<br/>out by ear, such that you think sounds better in that temperament.</p><p>&gt; I was thinking of the cases where D-G-C is used as a D7sus4 (no 3rd) chord,<br/>&gt; i.e., D is clearly the root (say it&apos;s doubled an octave or two lower by the<br/>&gt; bass). Your theory may not allow this interpretation but believe me, as a<br/>&gt; musician I know it is real.</p><p>&quot;D&quot;, you say? &quot;My&quot; theory (Partch would agree, I think) says that D is<br/>one of the two alternate roots (an incomplete Gm with added 4th,<br/>common overtone D). (Of course you do know this<br/>sort of calculus, only you do not apply it. BTW, I am still<br/>grateful for catching a silly mistake of mine once.)</p><p>&gt; In this case, bringing the seventh down toward<br/>&gt; 7/4 is helpful both in terms of making the 16:9 more<br/>&gt; consonant, and in terms of chord function.</p><p>I repeat, it might be so in certain progressions but I remain<br/>to be convinced with an example. In the static case my ears simply do<br/>not perceive the advantage, not yet in any case.

The truth is, I joined the list to look for<br/>suggestions on a certain subject but I got distracted by the<br/>argument on the ideal tuning of stacked fourths.
