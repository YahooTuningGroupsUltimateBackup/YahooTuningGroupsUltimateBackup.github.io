The actual scale measurements has<br/>been upheld by  the Dionysian woodwind maker, Jim French (dionysian in that<br/>he is considered one of the best meade makers in the world) he makes<br/>replica of all types of wind instruments including for Pharaoh Sanders. He<br/>swears by the book. Erv Wilson also has a large collection of South<br/>American flutes with equally spaced holes which also illustrate these<br/>subharmonic flutes as well as the tuning of the exit holes to sometimes a<br/>3/2 below one of the scale degrees. One of these flutes ,a double one ,was<br/>given to Partch and can be heard in Delusion of the Fury. The placing of<br/>two subharmonic scales at x interval but placed with the thirds &quot;parallel&quot;<br/>is a wide open possibility for further exploration. I for one have used two<br/>a 3/2 a part back in my opera &quot;War and Pieces&quot;.<br/>    Also in this book you find on Page 4,  a crosset of harmonic and<br/>subharmonic series, ala diamond like. True she probably over extends where<br/>these scales are actually found. But the actual Microtonal material is<br/>invaluable.</p><p>Joe Monzo wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Joe Monzo &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I invited a couple of people to take an advance look at my<br/>&gt; paper on Aristoxenus, and then realized that it would be a<br/>&gt; good idea to briefly outline ancient Greek tetrachord-theory.<br/>&gt; It turned out to be pretty detailed, so I put it online:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems particularly appropriate right now, since we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; begun discussing it again here on the List.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please bear with me concerning the links to Tuning Dictionary<br/>&gt; terms that still have no definitions; I simply don&apos;t have time<br/>&gt; to work on that now, but I thought it best to put the links in<br/>&gt; there now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As always, improvements and corrections are most welcome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
