The more common &quot;JI<br/>near-12-tet&quot; proposals of the later 18th-century tend to use a<br/>~500-cent fourth built from a Pythagorean apotome or chromatic<br/>semitone at 2187:2048 (~113.69 cents) plus a pure 5:4 major third at<br/>5:4 (~386.31 cents).</p><p>A psychological reason for my variant -- actually requiring an extra<br/>just fifth to derive each tempered interval, and also requiring a pure<br/>6:5 as opposed to 5:4, and thus even _less_ parsimonious -- is my<br/>fascination with the 8192:6561 schisma third, a vital interval in<br/>early 15th-century keyboard tunings. Thus I seem to recall reasoning:<br/>&quot;What interval plus a schisma third would add up to ~700 cents?&quot;</p><p>For those who may not have seen my original posts, I might explain<br/>that the association with Giovanni Maria Artusi, the famous critic of<br/>Monteverdi, comes from a statement of this theorist that he accepted<br/>12-tet for the lute, but would not admit it for voices until it could<br/>be associated with known ratios of rational numbers. Either<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s original 10935:8192, or the variant of 16384:10935,<br/>indeed might be taken as a solution to this &quot;riddle of Artusi.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
