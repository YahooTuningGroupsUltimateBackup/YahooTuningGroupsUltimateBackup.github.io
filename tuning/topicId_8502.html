Based on what I have learned about double negatives in writing<br/>a<br/>&lt;sentence, Werckmeister is saying the following: &quot;I am inclined, and<br/>maintain,<br/>&lt;that the diatonic thirds be purer in comparison with seldom used chromatic<br/>&lt;differences.&quot;</p><p>In rhetoric, a double negative is very often used when one does not quite<br/>want to make a positive sentence, hence the resigned tone here. A less<br/>literal translation would run:</p><p>&quot;In fact, I&apos;m not disinclined towards this. I&apos;ll keep on leaving the<br/>diatonic thirds somewhat purer than the more rarely used thirds.  This<br/>method of tuning also happens to yield good chromatic alterations.&quot;</p><p>&lt;Puzzling to me, is approval by a member of this list of any consensus<br/>&lt;(represented you say by Rasch) which considers a &quot;hypothetical&quot;<br/>Werckmeister<br/>&lt;to have approved of ET late in his life &quot;a theoretical advance.&quot;</p><p>Please don&apos;t be puzzled. As much as I advocate alternative intonations, I am<br/>even more an advocate for the truth.  However much I would like to believe<br/>that Werckmeister was consistantly committed to unequal cyclical tunings of<br/>which one of his own was a beautiful example, I just can&apos;t find that that<br/>position is supported satisfactorily by the evidence available. The lack of<br/>a decisive opinion by Werckmeister on the subject does not happen to<br/>influence my own opinion, nor do I suppose it influenced many of his<br/>contemporaries. (Unlike Kirnberger, he was not himself a composer and the<br/>extent his influence on subsequent musical composition and performance<br/>practice is questionable).</p><p>This indecisive outcome of research like this doesn&apos;t make things any<br/>easier, but the process of exploring the sources does convey a sense of the<br/>fine texture of the problem and its historical context in a way that is much<br/>more interesting (and I daresay, musically interesting) than had there been<br/>a simple answer.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
