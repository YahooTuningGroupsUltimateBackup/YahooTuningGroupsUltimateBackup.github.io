They&apos;re the ones with French titles, but only the last one uses pitches outside of 12-et. There are references to 8-et and 9-et; in the latter case, a pelogish pentatonic scale in the trombones. Nothing there is hardcore microtonal.</p><p>Which leads me to a question: how&apos;s this for a pelogic heptatonic gamut in 72-edo?</p><p>{0, 9, 18, 32, 40, 49, 58, 72}</p><p>I derived this tuning from 41-tone, using a generator of a fifth lowered by a comma (23 commas, that is), going down one fifth and up five. Then I mapped this to 41-out-of-72-tone Miracle.</p><p>~D.</p></div>
