To compare our music to that of<br/>north India by asking which is the more complex is<br/>simply ludicrous.&quot; -- Miller Puckette</p><p>    The first and most obvious point to bear in mind about<br/>Puckette&apos;s claim is the fact that Puckette probably means<br/>something counterintuitive by the word &quot;complexity.&quot;<br/>    If &quot;complexity&quot; means &quot;audibly complicated sounding,&quot;<br/>then Puckette&apos;s claim is usually demonstrably<br/>false. Much so-called &quot;new&quot; music is not complex. It<br/>does not sound complex at all -- on the contrary, it sounds<br/>trite and monotonous and wholly trivial.<br/>   Let us take a specific example:<br/>   B. Ferneyhough&apos;s piano composition &quot;Lemma-Icon-Epigram&quot;<br/>is alleged by many in academia to embody the so-called<br/>&quot;New Complexity.&quot;  This is the epitome of the kind of<br/>compopsition Puckette is probably talking about.<br/>   However, the ordinary listener (i.e., a listener not<br/>soaked in the ideology of the modernist musical Kloran)<br/>does not hear anything complex when s/he listens to<br/>&quot;Lemma-Icon-Epigram.&quot;<br/>   What the ordinary non-ideologized listener hears is<br/>an irregular herky-jerky clangor of rough intervals<br/>intersperesed with unpredictably loud and soft pitches<br/>which appear to follow no discernible melodic pattern,<br/>and which come and go spasmodically in the manner<br/>of cards falling out of a house of cards once the bottom-<br/>most card has been yanked away.<br/>   The oridnary listener quickly realizes that this musical<br/>composition has no functional harmonies and underlying<br/>rhythmic pulse and no discernible overall melodic arc.<br/>Ferneyhough&apos;s composition creates no sense of musical<br/>drama in the ordinary listener, and generates no detectable<br/>expectations about what might happen next, since the<br/>irregular and spadmodic musical events (intervals, melodic<br/>pitches, changes in dynamics, etc.) occur with any perceptible<br/>audible organization.<br/>    According the ordinary listener realizes within perhaps<br/>20-30 seconds that the music will continue going on like<br/>this until, at some unpredictable point in the future, it ends<br/>without warning.<br/>    This does not create a sense of &quot;complexity&quot; in the ordinary<br/>listener -- at least, in none of the ordinary listeners for whom<br/>I&apos;ve played excerpts of &quot;Lemma-Icon-Epigram.&quot;  Instead,<br/>the typical response from ordinary listeners is: &quot;Is it all like<br/>this?&quot;<br/>   When I answer &quot;Yes,&quot; the next question by ordinary listeners<br/>proves revealing: &quot;Well...then how long is this piece of music?&quot;<br/>(Or words to that effect.)<br/>    No matter what my answer, the ordinary listener eventually<br/>makes a remark to the effect &quot;This is really boring stuff. It&apos;s<br/>going nowhere.&quot;  (Again, words to that effect.)<br/>    Thus the alllegedly &quot;complex&quot; music of The New Complexity<br/>(so-called) actually creates a profound sense of monotony in<br/>ordinary (that is, non-ideologized) listeners. Ordinary listeners<br/>remark on the stultifying sameness of music of The New Complexity.<br/>After the first few seconds of spasmodic unpredictable pitches and<br/>intervals, the overall sound of this allegedly &quot;complex&quot; music settles<br/>down into a rut of unutterably wearisome unpredictability.<br/>    The net effect is the same as watching static on a TV screen.<br/>There<br/>is nothing complex about static on a TV screen. Each individual<br/>pixel on the TV screen shifts with great intricacy...but when you<br/>add up all the alleged intricacy, you get a dull-as-dishwater boring<br/>sameness because the overall statistical ensemble effect never varies.<br/>    Now, this is what people who claim to write &quot;complex&quot; music do<br/>not understand -- the human nverous system is a not a simple linear<br/>transmission line, like a telephone or a telegraph. The human nervous<br/>system is a sophisticated sieve which searches dynamically for<br/>patterns,<br/>and reduces at each hierarchical input stage the information coming<br/>in to its simplest representation. We do not literally see or<br/>actually hear<br/>the world around us -- we see only greatly infromation-reduced<br/>versions<br/>of the world around us, because our nervous systems are kludges which<br/>had to build on earlier and more primitive neurological structures and<br/>consequently the human nervous system can ony deal with a limited<br/>amount of information per unit time.<br/>    Exceeding that amount of information per unit time does not<br/>produce<br/>audibly more complex music. It prodcues audibly _less_ complex<br/>music...<br/>Because when the human nervous system encounters infromation it cannot<br/>parsimoniously reduce, it simply throws it out.<br/>    Consequently the human nervous system throws out 99% of what the<br/>ears take in when listening to a composition of the so-called &quot;New<br/>Complexity&quot;<br/>school.  Since we do not hear the world around us, but only<br/>parisomoniously<br/>information-compressed versions of the world around, what we hear<br/>when we<br/>listen to music of the &quot;New Complexity&quot; school is a statistical<br/>steady state<br/>which sounds ergodically uniform and therefore trivial. With new or<br/>no audible<br/>patterns to latch onto, the human ear/brain system dumps the surface<br/>events<br/>(individual notes, momentary note-clusters, briefly iterated herky-<br/>jerky<br/>rhythms which appear to form a pattern but rapidly go nowhere) and<br/>reports<br/>that there is very little regularity in the audible input.<br/>    As humans we literally do not hear sound input which has no<br/>discernible<br/>regularity -- after a short time, our nervous system filters it out,<br/>and we literally<br/>stop hearing the input. Examples of this include the white noise of<br/>the fan in<br/>your computer (ah -- you hear it now, but you didn&apos;t up until a few<br/>moments<br/>ago, did you), the murmur of coversation at a party, traffic noises<br/>oustide<br/>an apartment, and so on.<br/>    The music of the so-called &quot;New Complexity&quot; belongs to this class<br/>of<br/>statistically steady-state ensembles. Because the human ear/brain<br/>system is<br/>so sophisictaed, it rapidly learns to recognize and disregard such<br/>information-<br/>free statistically steady-state auditory inputs.  A constant spatter<br/>of herky-jerky<br/>pitches and intervals with no discernible overall pattern belongs to<br/>the same<br/>category of input, and is consequently regarded as the human nervous<br/>system<br/>as an input of minimal infomration which is not processed and thus<br/>does not<br/>even exist as far our higher-level musical perceptions are concerned.<br/>    Few people can listen to music of the &quot;New Complexity&quot; school<br/>because it<br/>is so trite and trivial, and so boring. As a statistical steady<br/>state, the only musical<br/>events of any note in such music are the extrema of the fluctuating<br/>normal<br/>distribution -- which is to say, the momentary louder or softer,<br/>higher or lower,<br/>shorter or longer, pitches and rhythms which represent the outermost<br/>boundaries<br/>of the variance around the statistical mean. Of course such<br/>statistically steady-state<br/>distributions can only be distinguished from one another by analysis<br/>of variance,<br/>the ehight of the mean, the rate at which the slope of the bell curve<br/>around the<br/>mean drops off, and so on. Thus, not only does one<br/>allegedly &quot;complex&quot; modernist<br/>musical composition sound unutterably wearisome and trite and trivial<br/>within<br/>its own length, but each allegedly &quot;complex&quot; modernist musical<br/>composition which<br/>strives for &quot;complexity&quot; sounds nearly indisguishable from each other<br/>allegedlly<br/>&quot;complex&quot; modernist musical composition -- differing only in such<br/>minor details<br/>as the variance around the mean pitch (the lowest notes and the<br/>highest notes),<br/>the general height of hte mean, and so on.<br/>    In ordinary musical terminology this means that one<br/>allegedly &quot;complex&quot;<br/>modernist composition can typicall be audibly distinguished from<br/>another<br/>such composition only insofar as one composition has a slightly louder<br/>chaotic spatter of patternless pitches and intervals, or another<br/>composition<br/>has a spasmodic set of incoherent and disorganized broken-apart<br/>rhythms<br/>which start and stop in a more extremely herky-jerky manner than<br/>another<br/>similiar composition.<br/>    This is familair to us from everyday experience. We do not<br/>usually make<br/>a distinction between two TV screens displaying static simply because<br/>we<br/>turn up the brightness knob on one TV, so that the static gets<br/>slightly<br/>brighter, or if we turn up the volume knob on the other TV so that the<br/>roar of white noise gets slightly louder  To ordinary observers,<br/>static on<br/>a TV screen is a statistically stationary and therefore boring and<br/>trivial<br/>visual input, and it still looks as boring and as trivial regardless<br/>of how much<br/>we turn up or turn down the volume knob or hte brightness knob or the<br/>contrast knob on the TV set.  There&apos;s nothing there, and playing with<br/>the<br/>knobs makes no difference to our seeing anything there.<br/>    The various competing modernist ideologies (aleastoric theory as<br/>developed by the coin-flipping kook, serial row schemes as developed<br/>by the Viennese kook, pitch-class set theory as elaborated by the<br/>Princeton kook) all represent nothing more than playing with the<br/>different<br/>knobs on a TV set. No matter how much anyone plays with the knobs,<br/>the static remains static -- our nerouvs sytem will not be fooled into<br/>suddenly finding the static on the TV screen wonderfully fascinating<br/>and<br/>marvellously emotionally gripping and imaginative simply because we<br/>turn the volume or the brightness or the contrast knob to one<br/>particular<br/>settting on the TV set.<br/>    In the same way, using one particular mathematical or ideological<br/>technique to produce sets of pitches with no discernible melody<br/>and no perceptible rhythmic pulse and no fucntional harmony and no<br/>audible organization will not suddenly fool the human ear/brain system<br/>into finding the incoherent herky-jerky splatters of pitches<br/>emotionally<br/>gripping and imaginative and wonderfully fascinating.  There is no<br/>technique which will accmplish this task as long as the modernist<br/>composer disregards the properties of the human nervous system.<br/>    The second and perhaps more important point to bear in mind<br/>is that most of the audible complexity in music is in the listener,<br/>not<br/>in the music. Thus Puckette&apos;s statement about the relatively<br/>complexity<br/>of North Indian music proves ironic, for 99% of the complexity in<br/>*either* Western *or* Indian music resides in the listener. The<br/>complexity arises from the subtle web of cltural relatiionships which<br/>invisibly guide the listener to a recognition of how the Indic or<br/>Western<br/>composer is doing things differently, and how the Indic or Western<br/>composer is doing things the same, as other composers in the<br/>same culture.<br/>    To attempt to abstract the alleged &quot;complexity&quot; of music from the<br/>web of cultural relationships which sustain it is approximately the<br/>same<br/>kind of ingenious insight as scraping all the paint off the Mona Lisa<br/>and<br/>dumping it in a mass spectrometer in an effort to see the painting<br/>better.<br/>    Such escapades do not end well.<br/>    How do we take note of the properties of the human nervous in<br/>music?<br/>    By a feedback process of learning while doing -- this process<br/>involves a social interaction with other members of the same<br/>culture. It develops an intuition for what works musically as<br/>compared to<br/>what does not work musically.  Misnamed &quot;musical talent,&quot; this<br/>process of hands-on learning by doing can occur only as long as<br/>the human nervous system is not clogged up by inputs which<br/>prevent the composer from actually *hearing* the music<br/>s/he produces, and the music other composers produce.<br/>    One such input which prevents composers from hearing<br/>things is called &quot;ideology.&quot;  It is the primary work product of<br/>20th century composers, and future centuries will regard with<br/>mixed laughter and disbelief the fact that so many smart people<br/>could use so much intellectual wattage to generate such a<br/>sophisticated way of making themselves stupid.<br/>    The simplest and most straightforward way of making your<br/>stupid is to marinate yourself with an ideology which prevents<br/>you from interacting with reality. Even the most badly mentally<br/>defective imbecile cannot manage to make hi/rself as blindly<br/>stupid as the ideologue -- precisely because the ideologue<br/>twists all of hi/r brainpower into ignoring reality in service of<br/>some self-delusion. Orindary people cannot act or think<br/>this stupidly.  It requires sustained effort, hard work, a<br/>vast intellect, and enormous dedication. To reach the highest<br/>and most Olympian levels of stpuidity, in short, you need a PhD.<br/>   What has this to do with microtonality?<br/>   By following Puckette&apos;s reasoning to its logical conclusion,<br/>we arrive at the concept that the primary justification for<br/>going outside the conventional Western tuning is to crank up<br/>the complexity of the music even further. If 12 pitches allow<br/>12 factorial possible interrelations, then 30 pitches allow 30<br/>factorial possible itnerrelationships, and 70 pitches allow<br/>70 facotrial, and so on.<br/>    The erstwhile modernist copmoser quickly realizes, however,<br/>that going outside 12 is futile. Since, as mentioned, the audible<br/>information in most music of the &quot;New Complexity&quot; vastly<br/>exceeds the information processing capability of the human<br/>nervous system already (just listen to Ferneyhough or the music<br/>of the Parisian kook or the Pirinceton kook), increasing<br/>the number of pitch relationships will make no audible difference.<br/>A scrambled set of incoherent herky-jerky pitches and intervals<br/>which spasmodically clang and screech in 12 equal will sound<br/>no different than a scrambled set of icoherent herky-herky pitches<br/>and itnervals spasmodically claning and screeching in 31 equal,<br/>or 71 limit just intonation, or an Erv Wilson Combination Product<br/>Set, or members 11183-37827 of the harmonic series.<br/>    Encountering this paradox, the modernist composer iincorrectly<br/>concludes that microtonality is worthless because it makes no<br/>audible difference to the music. Thus does microtonality receive<br/>such short shrift from academia.<br/>    A carpenter who bangs twice as hard with his screwdrive in a vain<br/>attempt to beat a nail into a board will not get anywhere. This does<br/>not mean that the screwdriver is useless as a tool.  But it does say<br/>something about the carpenter.<br/>----------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
