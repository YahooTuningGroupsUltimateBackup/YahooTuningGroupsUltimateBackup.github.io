My wife was given a CD of Leopold Godowsky&apos;s<br/>&quot;Java Suite.&quot;  Apparently Godowsky was a known American composer and<br/>pianist at the turn of the century, teaching at the Chicago<br/>Conservatory. Has anyone ever heard of this piece??</p><p>With movement titles like &quot;Gamelan,&quot; &quot;Wayang-Purva (Puppet Shadow<br/>Plays)&quot;, etc., there is an approximation to Javanese music.  It&apos;s not<br/>entirely unpleasant.</p><p>But it is all for piano solo in 12-tET!!!</p><p>Why is this interesting?</p><p>Well, it seems like a possible way to assess the real impact of<br/>intonation in this music.  How much of the integral nature of this music<br/>is in the tuning, and how much is in structures that could be<br/>replicated, imitated or approximated through other tuning systems??  Of<br/>course, the entire attempt was to &quot;paraphrase&quot; orientalisms in a<br/>quotational sense... I believe all the rage at that time... Debussy,<br/>Ravel come to mind.</p><p>Well... my own feeling was that it was a bit like the difference between<br/>a &quot;black and white&quot; photo and a color one... the experience not being<br/>totally destroyed, but certainly &quot;cheapened&quot; in the 12-tET.</p><p>I am certain that some would feel even more strongly about this<br/>intonational inaccuracy.  In fact, I believe this was the kind of music<br/>that was banned in Anaphoria around 1895, due to its intonational<br/>infidelities....</p><p>_________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
