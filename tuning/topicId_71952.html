My question about this temperament related<br/>&gt; solely to its melodic/harmonic possibilities, and not to historical and<br/>&gt; musicological ramifications. Oy, the invective!</p><p>Well, why would you be interested in only &apos;this temperament&apos; and not<br/>in dozens of other historical and modern possibilities?</p><p>&gt; Questions for our harpsichordists:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) What would you consider to be an apropriate, serviceable and generic<br/>&gt; well-temperament for this instrument?</p><p>But which instrument? Different harpsichords have quite different<br/>timbres (partial structures and time evolution of tone). And many<br/>historical instruments were almost certainly built with the<br/>expectation of being tuned to meantone - then what would be doing by<br/>putting &apos;well-temperament&apos; on them?</p><p>Also, there is not much point in having a harpsichord &apos;generic<br/>well-temperament&apos; since the tuning of the instrument has at least to<br/>be checked, if not completely overhauled, every time you want to<br/>perform. Then you had better devise a specific &apos;well-temperament&apos;, or<br/>indeed ill-temperament, depending on the intended repertoire or genre<br/>and musical effect. That is, you&apos;d better learn to adjust all the<br/>relevant characteristics of the tuning by ear.</p><p>&gt; For the organ?</p><p>As a harpsichordist, I can&apos;t say much about &apos;the organ&apos; - except that<br/>organs are rather more varied (i.e. less &apos;generic&apos;) in their tonal and<br/>mechanical characteristics than harpsichords.</p><p>&gt; 2) Same question, re: meantone temperament?</p><p>Sorry, you&apos;ve lost me here. You can try many different types of<br/>meantone, of which the easiest and arguably most consonant is 1/4<br/>comma. However, there is absolutely no reason to pick a &apos;generic&apos;<br/>meantone in preference to all others: you may prefer to change between<br/>meantones depending on the period / genre of music.</p><p>and...</p><p>2b) Why not ask about tunings which are neither meantone nor &apos;well&apos; -<br/>so-called modified meantone or temperament ordinaire? They had an<br/>important historical role, and have unique musical properties.</p><p>&gt; 3) How common are split keys on modern harpsichords (and organs)</p><p>Not very</p><p>&gt; in what configuration</p><p>Most common is two: Eb/D# and G#/Ab</p><p>Next, but considerably rarer still, is probably the 19-note<br/>configuration with 5 split accidentals plus E# and B#.</p><p>&gt; 4) Have you ever used a just tuning for certain historical styles?</p><p>Only (very rarely) Pythagorean, which may or may not be classed as &apos;just&apos;</p><p>As for &apos;desecration&apos;, I once strummed the Harry Lime theme on a<br/>clavichord, which sounded rather good. The tuning wasn&apos;t anything<br/>remarkable though.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
