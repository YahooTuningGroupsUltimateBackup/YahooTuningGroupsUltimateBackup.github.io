I reaaally like scales like this that have an odd East-West _frisson_ going<br/>on. 21st root of 20:13 is also quite bit more &quot;affective&quot; with it&apos;s augment<br/>intense chromatic scale-ness... String, string-like &amp; other odd-harmonic<br/>dominant timbral sounds are best AFAIK.</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang<br/>&quot;Space is a practiced place.&quot; -- Michel de Certeau<br/>&quot;Space is the Place for the Human Race.&quot; -- William S. Burroughs</p><p>&quot;... simple, chaotic, anarchic and menacing.... This is what people of today<br/>have lost and need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily and<br/>mental ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from<br/>other worlds and nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which<br/>come in static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko<br/>(Donald L. Philippi)</p><p>    The German word for &quot;noise&quot; _Ger&auml;usch_ is derived from _rauschen_ &quot;the<br/>sound of the wind,&quot; related to _Rausch_ &quot;ecstasy, intoxication&quot; hinting at some<br/>of the possible aesthetic, bodily effects of noise in music. In Japanese<br/>Romaji: _uchu_ = &quot;universe&quot;... _uchoten_ =  &quot;ecstasty,&quot; &quot;raputure&quot;..._uchujin_ =<br/>[space] alien! &quot;When you&apos;re trying to do something you should feel absolutely<br/>alone, like a spark in the blackness of the universe.&quot;-Xenakis</p><p>    &quot;For twenty-five centuries, Western knowledge has tried to look upon the<br/>world. It has failed to understand that the world is not for the beholding. It<br/>is for the hearing. It is not legible, but audible. ... Music is a herald,<br/>for change is inscribed in noise faster than it transforms society. ...<br/>Listening to music is listening to all noise, realizing that its appropriation and<br/>control is a reflection of power, that is essentially political.&quot; - Jacques<br/>Attali, _Noise: The Political Economy of Music_</p><p>&quot;Dudes and Dudettes! You do not need drugs when there are nonoctave tunings!<br/>And nonoctave tunings are clean and safe and legal. Though they will surely be<br/>outlawed once the feds realize the incredible power of xenharmonics!!!! &quot;-XJ<br/>Scott</p><p>    &quot;The sky and its stars make music in you.&quot; - Dendera, Egypt wall<br/>inscription</p><p>&quot;Sound as an isolated object of reproduction, call it our collective memory<br/>bank... Any sound can be you.&quot; - DJ Spooky that Subliminal Kid (a.k.a. Paul D.<br/>Miller)</p></div>
