Can it be that you&apos;re &quot;softening on seven&quot;?  My impression<br/>&gt;&gt;has been that you pretty much consider a 7-limit treatment of pieces<br/>&gt;&gt;originally written in 12-tET to be inappropriate, or am I mistaken?</p><p>[Paul E:]<br/>&gt;You are mistaken -- read the exchanges again. It is for Baroque and<br/>&gt;Classical-period music that I found a 7-limit treatment inappropriate.<br/>&gt;For Schoenberg, like Wagner or Stravinsky, I&apos;d say go for it!</p><p>Where do you put Brahms?  Schubert?  Beethoven?  I guess if Wagner&apos;s in<br/>then Ravel could be.  Some 20th century pieces (12 tone row, for<br/>example) would seem to be intimately wedded to 12-tET, to my thinking.</p><p>I guess it comes back to the difference in our perception of the 7-limit<br/>dom 7th: I feel that its sense of needing resolution is strengthened<br/>by its tuning, you feel that the sense is weakened (again, correct me if<br/>I am misrepresenting you!).</p><p>Here&apos;s a thought: in distinguishing between consonance and concordance,<br/>you used the example of a perfect fourth being dissonant under some<br/>circumstances (and I do agree that a chord in second inversion is not<br/>stable; it pulls toward V in root position).  If a perfect fourth can be<br/>dissonant and concordant at the same time, then surely the much more<br/>complex 4:5:6:7 chord can as well!  And the ear can hear it just as<br/>strongly as needing resolution.</p><p>Also, to harken back to your point that the type of music being played<br/>alters the meaning of the word consonance (major triads are dissonant<br/>in old music, seventh chords are consonant in the Blues).  This point<br/>can be taken to strengthen the argument for using 4:5:6:7 dom 7ths for<br/>a wide range of music for which the context already establishes that a<br/>7th chord needs to resolve (however it is tuned).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=12822 href="#12822">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2000 2:08:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Also, to harken back to your point that the type of music being played<br/>&gt;&gt;alters the meaning of the word consonance (major triads are dissonant<br/>&gt;&gt;in old music, seventh chords are consonant in the Blues).

Doesn&apos;t your point imply that 7th chords are consonant<br/>in blues music whether or not the actual chords are tuned JI or 12-tET<br/>or something else?  Wouldn&apos;t the same apply to other music?  I&apos;m not<br/>claiming that the point means the tuning MUST be JI 7-limit, only saying<br/>that other factors mean the chords are dissonant (the way you define it)<br/>no matter how they&apos;re tuned.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;I love Ravel, but I think it would depend on the piece. And it might<br/>&gt;also be worth making a distinction between utonal and otonal chords --<br/>&gt;as we&apos;ve heard Joseph Pehrson attest, 4:5:6:7 is far more clearly the<br/>&gt;&quot;target&quot; tuning for a dominant seventh than 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 is for a<br/>&gt;half-diminished seventh.</p><p>I would use 5:6:7:9 for a half-diminished seventh.  I tried<br/>1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 and didn&apos;t care for it.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=12852 href="#12852">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 4:44:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I would use 5:6:7:9 for a half-diminished seventh.</p><p>[Paul E:]<br/>&gt;In Baroque and Classical music, this is clearly inappropriate, as we<br/>&gt;found with reference to the Bach example. The minor triad within this<br/>&gt;chord should really be tuned 1/6:1/5:1/4, not 6:7:9, if you&apos;re not<br/>&gt;looking for an intentionally &quot;xenobaroque&quot; effect.</p><p>Yes, I remember the example, and for 5-limit tuning I added a &quot;5-limit<br/>utonal&quot; tuning file to the mix to give the half-diminished chord another<br/>way to go.  But, after listening to the same for 7-limit music, I found<br/>I preferred 5:6:7:9.  It has nothing to do with being &quot;intentionally<br/>xenobaroque&quot;.</p><p>Which brings us to a point made before, but not in this latest exchange,<br/>so at the risk of saying the obvious: all this intellectual hand-waving<br/>(I speak of myself as well as anyone else) is subordinate to what the<br/>ear likes.  I went through a period of listening, now years ago, when<br/>seven was tough for me to swallow, but, in my experience at least, once<br/>its beauty sinks in, there&apos;s no going back.  I can listen to little bits<br/>of five now, but not for long.</p><p>Paul, it&apos;s very clear that you prefer 5-limit tuning; that would be true<br/>whether you held all the intellectual justifications (as you believe you<br/>do) or they stood facing the other way.  So, when we have an exchange<br/>such as:</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m not claiming that the point means the tuning MUST be JI 7-limit,<br/>&gt;&gt;only saying that other factors mean the chords are dissonant (the way<br/>&gt;&gt;you define it) no matter how they&apos;re tuned.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Right -- but it&apos;s a cop-out to then say &quot;well, then, I might as well<br/>&gt;target 4:5:6:7 no matter what the style of music&quot;.</p><p>I think you&apos;re side-stepping the larger point.  It can never be a<br/>&quot;cop-out&quot; to tune music in a way that pleases one!  If I knock out one<br/>of your intellectual underpinnings and leave a dozen in place, that is<br/>of relevance only in the intellectual sphere.</p><p>You continue:</p><p>&gt;For example, if you have a ii-V7-I progression, the 2nd and 4th scale<br/>&gt;degrees should suffer a noticeable retune motion -- while targeting a<br/>&gt;4:5:6:7 for V7 is likely to induce it if the vertical springs are<br/>&gt;moderately strong.</p><p>Yes, 7-limit music &quot;suffers&quot; from a lot of retune motion, and even I,<br/>quite tolerant of that motion, agree that it&apos;s a significant price to<br/>pay.  Adjusting down the strength of the vertical springs greatly helps,<br/>while keeping most chords within a few cents of just.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=12855 href="#12855">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 5:08:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Joseph Pehrson:]<br/>&gt;For what it&apos;s worth, I have mentioned the Heinrich Schenker quote<br/>&gt;from his _Harmony_ before.
