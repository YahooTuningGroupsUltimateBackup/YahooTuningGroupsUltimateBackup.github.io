I don&apos;t think that Partch has a problem with abstract music (in fact he<br/>does at one point state that there is nothing wrong with Abstraction), more with the presentation<br/>of abstract art as the one true way, and being Partch he doesn&apos;t hold back from polarising. The<br/>most astonishing (depressing) truth in reading Partch again is that you add 53 or so years to the<br/>date of publication and whole pages of what he writes still apply today. The gauntlet is still<br/>down.</p><p>Partch writes and of course lived with such conviction that it becomes tempting to immerse oneself<br/>in his ideas. Personally I would find it very difficult to set aside abstract music as so much of<br/>my emotional/psychological/musical makeup had its development in abstract music. But for theatre,<br/>and especially with young actors and an enlightened producer, I am greatly tempted to see how far<br/>I can press Partch&apos;s ideas, not out of any desire to get an edge on other musical directors but to<br/>see where the ideas lead. Add to that my belief that they go hand in glove with justly intoned<br/>voice and instruments in which I have a vested interest.</p><p>Kind Regards<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3><a id=41721 href="#41721">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2003 12:14:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle and Jon</p><p>thanks for the replies.

And now that I&apos;m forced to examine it, I&apos;m not so proud of it. It starts off well, but toward the end I go off into one of my usual cantankerous harangues about god knows what. In the old days, the process of merely writing an article would generaly cause me to get some kind of bug up my ass by the end. And I made some points about abstraction that have been intelligently contradicted on the list in recent days. So please don&apos;t hold me to any opinions expressed below - that was the 40-year-old Kyle Gann, and he&apos;s long gone. Editing at the Village Voice began to decline after 1995. But the article does raise the point about corporeality, and quote Partch&apos;s disdain for the number 43, a topical concern. Sorry to arouse all the anticipation for so little reward. But thanks for your interest.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle</p><p>Village Voice<br/>May 7, 1996</p><p>Composing the Lingo<br/>Harry Partch, American inventor<br/>By Kyle Gann</p><p>Harry Partch was the central figure of American music. I can&apos;t think of another statement more guaranteed to elicit academic contempt from the academic establishment, reproving looks from jazz critics, even raised eyebrows from Cage fans. Ten years ago I would have demurred myself. But I&apos;m more and more drawn to that conclusion as I hear Downtown composers struggle to divest themselves of layer after layer of European brainwashing. The Kerouac of music, Partch molded his aesthetic around the slang of the hoboes he traveled among, and if his music doesn&apos;t sound like second nature, it&apos;s because we still listen through a German filter. In reality the above opinion says less about Partch than about what constitutes Americanness in music; where we put Partch depends on where we decide to put Europe. My vote is, on the other side of the ocean.</p><p>The incredibly well-organized American Composers Forum (formerly the Minnesota Composers Forum) has just released a welcome slew of new Partch materials through the innova label. (They are available from Minnesota Composers Forum, 332 Minnesota Street, #E 145, Saint Paul, MN 55101 1300). Enclosure 1: Harry Partch, as they&apos;ve titled it, is a video of four films, long rumored but rarely seen, that Partch made in the late &apos;50s-early &apos;60s with Chicago filmmaker Madeline Tourtelot. Enclosure 2 is a whopping four-CD set of Partch memorabilia, including early performances, interviews, public statements, tuning demonstrations, dramatized extracts from his memoir Bitter Music, and even 46 minutes of friends reminiscing at his wake.</p><p>Enclosure 3, yet to come, will be a tome entitled A Partch Scrapbook. The materials contained in these sets are rough, quirky, unpolished, often recorded under adverse conditions. They will not impress anyone who didn&apos;t take Partch seriously in the first place; don&apos;t listen to them unless you&apos;ve heard his masterpieces Delusion of the Fury, The Bewitched, U.S. Highball, Castor and Pollux. But for those of us converted long ago, the lot is a treasure trove of early sketches and intimate moments that invite us to rethink Partch&apos;s significance.</p><p>And it needs rethinking. Because Partch built his own Dr. Seuss world of flamboyant instruments, invented his own 43-tones-to-the-octave scale, and devised his own notation, his music now rests in the hands of specialists and has spawned a cottage industry jealously guarded by those who performed with him. Scores, except for Barstow and On the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma (both published in Source, the 1960s journal of avant-garde music), are nearly impossible to come by. Those who can get access to them have a hell of a time figuring out what pitches are intended. Each instrument - the Spoils of War, the Quadrangularis Reversum, the Diamond Marimba - has its own tablature-like notation, and the info Partch provided in his book Genesis of a Music is not always sufficient for transcription. Despite the fine recordings available, Partch&apos;s methods remain hidden from outsiders who would like to study them, and the priests of his cult are in no hurry to change the situation.</p><p>The priests swear by the 43-tone scale [not sure whom I meant to calumniate here], but Enclosure 2 allows Partch to make abundantly clear that tuning was only a secondary issue. What he was passionate about was the concept he called corporeality: the &quot;essentially vocal and verbal music of the individual,&quot; the ability of music to be &quot;vital to a time and place, a here and now,&quot; the exact dead opposite of German classical abstraction. Genesis of a Music&apos;s magnificent opening essay, &quot;From Emperor Chun to the Vacant Lot,&quot; mentions tuning only in passing as it explores in depth the history of the musically communicating human voice. For Partch, the Christian church wiped out the corporeality of ancient Greek music by insisting on hymns in which the God-praising words were already known and distorted by many notes to each syllable, encouraging a passive, uninvolved listening attitude.</p><p>Partch scorned abstract music, devoid of words, dance, or drama. Like so many young people who avoid sitting in concert halls today, he found passive listening a denial of the body. (In one telling story of his childhood, he heaps resentment on the girl who called him naughty for unselfconsciously drawing a male horse as he had seen it, with phallus proudly erect.) Aside from purity of tuning, he devised his scale at least partly to capture the exact inflections of spoken English. He may have written operas, but he was closer to Bob Dylan than to Verdi, and also to the Balinese Monkey Chant, the Korean P&apos;ansori epic, ancient Greek drama, early Florentine opera, the blues, any genre which uses music to enhance, not dominate, a story. He saw his reputation veering toward that of a tuning theoretician, and he tried to head this off at the pass. In the only segment of Enclosure 2 that deals with tuning - a demonstration with musical examples called &quot;A Quarter Saw Section of Motivations and Intonations&quot; - he attempts, in an impatient preface, to put tuning it its place:</p><p>&quot;The experiential, ritualistic, dramatic area has constituted a very large part of my belief and work.... I have easily given as much time to this endeavor as to intonation, which is basically the content of this tape.... I shall pass over, with compelling sadness and with no further comment, easily two-thirds of my life&apos;s work to discuss and demonstrate intonation.... News stories and even reviews have almost consistently latched onto the number 43 as though this were the touchstone of my life. It is not. It is, in fact, about the one-half truth of the one-fourth factor. It is totally misleading.&quot; The examples are invaluable, though, as apparently the only surviving aural document of how Partch thought about harmony, especially for his fascinating concept of tonal flux, in which chords mutate into each other through tiny pitch slides.</p><p>The rest of the CD set is obsessed with corporeality, and the early music Partch wrote to advance that concept can be pretty weird. His 1943 setting of Psalm 137 wails dismally, and in a 1947 recording of his Li Po songs (self-accompanied on Adapted Viola), his energy is so astonishing he sounds a little crazy. Put those recordings together with the photo of an amazingly clean-cut young Partch on the cover and you can&apos;t imagine how this music could have meant anything to anybody in the context of the 1940s. Use of normal flute and oboe in Y.D. Fantasy (from 1944) shows that he wasn&apos;t reluctant to employ conventional tuning, and in Philip Blackburn&apos;s rendition of a 1929 pop song (published under the pen name Paul Pirate), we get a rare glimpse of a pre-just-intonation Partch writing for good old badly tuned piano.</p><p>What clashes with Partch&apos;s reputation is the desire for correct and natural English declamation he speaks of so eloquently in one interview after another. [I have no idea what I thought this sentence meant.] Partly this is the natural result of overspecialization; most composers spend their time among similarly educated colleagues, not among street people, too far from the pulse of America to pick up the lingo. They write music about music theory for the same reason English professors write novels about university life. And so the tuning specialists involved in extending Partch&apos;s work [I can only think of one example, sorry for the overgeneralization] show little concern for corporeality. There are a couple of exceptions in Ben Johnston&apos;s output: Visions and Spels and Letter from Calamity Jane. Dean Drummond, caretaker for several of Partch&apos;s original instruments, has commissioned new works for the Partch ensemble, a noble effort. The results, however, have been as abstract as any Darmstadt serial piece, usually without even a feelable beat.</p><p>Today&apos;s corporealists don&apos;t come from the world of microtones. Robert Ashley and Mikel Rouse wed vernacular phrases to music in ways that I think would have tickled Partch. Otherwise, corporeality has primarily become a woman&apos;s movement. Laurie Anderson, Meredith Monk, Laetitia de Compiegne Sonami, Brenda Hutchinson, Eve Beglarian, Elise Kermani, Pamela Z, Maria de Alvear, Susan Parenti - all these women who use their voices in a direct, communicative way come closer to the effect Partch was seeking than any of the tuning purists. [This can only apply to what I had been hearing on the New York scene at the time.] Abstraction remains the favored realm of the ambitious male who would rather get in the history books that connect with the audience in front of him. Even guitarist composers working with rock, that great fortissimo outburst of corporeality, are turning it toward wordless abstraction. [Lord knows what I had just heard that elicited that vague complaint.] Looked at from that angle, the question becomes, not &quot;Is Partch the greatest American composer?&quot;, but, &quot;Aside from Partch and a few others, does American music exist at all?&quot;</p><p>Sidebar:</p><p>Sin More!</p><p>&quot;I have never heard anyone play Chopin as well as I do!&quot;, crows an audibly drunk Harry Partch after playing a few bars at the piano in 1966, and suddenly, you have to remember that one of the works he burned in an iron stove at age 28 was a piano concerto he had worked on for four years. These CDs fill out our picture of Partch into a life of tremendous complexity. We finally hear Partch&apos;s settings of &quot;The Jabberwocky&quot; and passages from Finnegans Wake, plus an overdue recording of U.S. Highball, his unparalleled homage to hobo life. In an early version of Barstow, the rhythmic momentum is oddly submerged beneath the pitch-bending surface of strings and Chromelodeon (43-pitch reed organ); the most infectious aspect of Partch&apos;s music, his dancelike percussion momentum, seems to have entered his aesthetic later.</p><p>The Tourtelot films of Enclosure 1, 70 minutes&apos; worth in all, don&apos;t date as well. They include an abstract film of gymnasts shot from odd angles to an oompah-pahing band accompaniment; a documentary of a pipe-smoking, uptight-looking Partch playing his instruments in his Chicago studio; and the film Windsong, for which Partch wrote the score, an updating of the Apollo and Daphne myth with the protagonists on the beach in shorts. The music survives and the personal glimpses are curious, but there is no hint of the gleeful, nose-thumbing Partch of later documentaries such as The Dreamer that Remains (1972), made after his elevation to a cult figure in the &apos;60s. He seems uneasy that his music will be dismissed as not serious if he so much as cracks a smile.</p><p>In audio, though, Partch emerges as a whole human, full of demons and self-contradictions. He praises Mussorgsky as the only Western composer he likes, the John Field Piano Concerto as the best ever written [I&apos;d love to have this straightened out, since Field wrote seven piano concerti], and the overdubbed voice in Stockhausen&apos;s Gesang der Junglinge as a brilliant idea. A musician who fell afoul of Partch while staying with him recounts finding an ice pick driven through his pillow. [I didn&apos;t have nearly enough space to do justice to this chilling anecdote.] And another friend remembers what Partch called the five most evil words in the English language: &quot;Go and sin no more!&quot; K.G.</p></div><h3><a id=41732 href="#41732">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E; &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2003 6:38:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; And now that I&apos;m<br/>&gt; forced to examine it, I&apos;m not so proud of it.
