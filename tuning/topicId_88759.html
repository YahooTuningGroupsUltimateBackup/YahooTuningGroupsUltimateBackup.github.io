But in this case, it&apos;s more than twice as many generators needed to approximate a single 4:6:7:8 compared to 4:5:6:8. This makes me think, similarly to meantone, that magic is &quot;primarily&quot; a 5-limit temperament and that the 7s are simply &quot;something extra&quot; which happens to be close enough to be applicable.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2010 11:59:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/> This makes me think, similarly to meantone, that magic<br/>&gt; is &quot;primarily&quot; a 5-limit temperament and that the 7s are simply &quot;something<br/>&gt; extra&quot; which happens to be close enough to be applicable.</p><p>Hmmm...I wonder how Graham thinks of it?
