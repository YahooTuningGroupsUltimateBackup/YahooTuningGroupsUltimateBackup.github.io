For example, using C4 as middle C, with the numbers<br/>showing octaves (higher numbers, higher notes), this could be a standard<br/>cadence:</p><p>               Db4      C#4<br/>               Ab3      G#3<br/>               Fb3/D#3  C#3</p><p>In the kind of style, a usual cadence often has a major third expanding to<br/>a fifth, and a major sixth expanding to an octave -- and in 17-tET, there<br/>are equivalences such as D#3=Fb3, but Db4 is a usual semitone of 1/17<br/>octave below C#4, just as Ab3 is a semitone below G#3. These are the<br/>diatonic or small semitones of about 71 cents, in contrast to a large<br/>semitone of 2/17 octave or about 141 cents such as C-C# or Db-D.</p><p>What I want to emphasize is that this is not just a matter or theory, it<br/>is a matter of practical musicmaking and keyboard playing. My own approach<br/>is to have a C# on one keyboard and a Db on another, but with a more<br/>sophisticated type of keyboard design both could be present on a single<br/>keyboard manual, for example.</p><p>A difficulty of this kind of discussion is that a few minutes at any<br/>actual keyboard instrument with both C# and Db would explain much more<br/>than any theory read apart from such an experience.</p><p>By the way, may I invite anyone fluent in Russian, or some other useful<br/>exchange language, to translate what I say so that it may be more<br/>intelligible, and also, from you Latchezar or anyone, any questions.</p><p>Thank you for raising basic and important questions, ones one encourage me<br/>to focus on concrete musical experience.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
