The raspy tanbur is the principal plucked-string instrument of the region, and is also prominent in Ottoman music. A solo recital, with more of a &quot;folk&quot; inspiration:</p><p>  Turquie: L&apos;art du tanb&ucirc;r<br/>  Talip &Ouml;zkan<br/>  Ocora (Radio France) C 560042<br/>This is Talip &Ouml;zkan&apos;s second recording for Ocora, and both combine tanbur playing with singing. The songs &amp; modes are taken from throughout Anatolia, and have a closer resemblance to some traditions of Central Asia than does the Ottoman-derived music of Kudsi Erguner. The forms remain makam-derived, and improvisation is an important aspect of this style. The result is something of a folk anthology, but delivered with great sophistication.</p><p>=============</p><p>Some people apparently confuse tanbur with baglama and Maqam Music with Folk improvisation. Ethnomusicologists, where are you?</p></div>
