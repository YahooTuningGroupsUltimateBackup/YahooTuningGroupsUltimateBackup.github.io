I bought<br/>it for enterring midi parts and found it unusable for<br/>that purpose. For playing live it would be okay, as mixed<br/>with the guitar signal, the delay on the low notes would<br/>be unnoticeable and the occasional glitches and misfirings<br/>would be &apos;texture&apos;.</p><p>Regarding fretless, I found that I didn&apos;t like the lack of<br/>sustain (I just pulled the frets from a maple neck) and<br/>also realized that intonation WAS going to be a significant<br/>retraining.</p><p>So then I got a fretted neck and the midi stuff and still<br/>didn&apos;t like that guitar. Maybe I&apos;ll try the fretless neck<br/>with the midi instead of selling the whole pile...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
