The math is in appendix XV.</p><p>There are also cochlear echos which can be picked up by a microphone after<br/>an impulse is played into the ear, usually after a delay of 60ms or so.<br/>After playing two tones x and y into an ear, an echo may be detected at 2x-y<br/>and may be audible to the ear owner as a combination tone. I had always<br/>thought that conbination tones were purely subjective, but apparantly not.<br/>(This may be apropos to the subharmonic thread - If a person is singing and<br/>his ear is acually producing various combination tone echos, then the<br/>situation of what the person may be hearing in their own head may be alot<br/>more complicated, even before considering it as a chaotic system).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve always thought that HP merely took Helmholtz&apos;s first octave curve,<br/>&gt;smoothed it a bit, then reflected it about the horizontal axes and<br/>&gt;rotated the result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--John</p><p>In some ways they look similar, but seem to be scaled differently.<br/>Especially in the semitone closest to the unison, Partch has that area<br/>looking not much more dissonant than the next semitone, whereas in Helmholtz<br/>the roughness there is precipitous.</p><p>dante</p></div>
