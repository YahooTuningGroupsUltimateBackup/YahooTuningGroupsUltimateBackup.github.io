In fact, I drafted an (unsent) message to tuning-math asking<br/>about this for the some of the 5-limit temperaments on monz&apos;s chart.</p><p>&gt;In them 15, 22, 37 and 59 (which you might add to your porcupine list)<br/>&gt;work in the same way. I&apos;ll spare you the wedgies, but the Minkowski-Tenney<br/>&gt;reduced bases are [64/63, 250/243] for the 7-limit and [55/54, 64/63,<br/>&gt;100/99] for the 11-limit. Porky comes in with a fairly low badness score<br/>&gt;(under 400) for the 5, 7 and 11-limits, but the lowest was 11-limit,<br/>&gt;incidentally.</p><p>Those are some killer commas.  &apos;tis shaping up to be a great-o temper-mo!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
