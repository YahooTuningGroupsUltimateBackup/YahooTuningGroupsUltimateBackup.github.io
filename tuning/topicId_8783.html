Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2000 2:02:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jerry wrote,</p><p>&gt;After dealing with all that marginally relative discourse, let me ask<br/>&gt;whether you understand the main points of my post?--that if the key had<br/>been<br/>&gt;F, the F would likely have been tuned in a 3:4 relationship to the C, and<br/>&gt;more importantly, that the &quot;kids&quot; could hear (or sense) that it did not.</p><p>I understand that point, and my argument against it was based on a musical<br/>example I did not even here. Would you mind sending me the passage in<br/>question (which was before the drone came in, and none of the students had<br/>yet heard the drone, right?) and I&apos;ll either retract or reiterate.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So &quot;your&quot; augmented fourth is _larger_ than 7:10?</p><p>&gt;I didn&apos;t actually measure it. It just sounds appropriately tuned. Actually,<br/>&gt;it&apos;s not a functional tritone so its &quot;tendency&quot; isn&apos;t relevant.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You sure didn&apos;t like that<br/>&gt;&gt; sort of thing in Monz&apos; I-IV-V7-I example with the V7 with high third and<br/>low<br/>&gt;&gt; seventh.</p><p>&gt;As you have said, context is everything. :-) Perhaps the difference is in<br/>&gt;_how high and _how low.</p><p>Fine. I hope we can pin these things down someday. If at least you, as an<br/>author, can identify the ratios (or non-ratios?) you&apos;re hearing, it will be<br/>a great boon to your presentation.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But I&apos;m positive Chandra&apos;s seventh is _way_ higher than a 4:7. Try a<br/>&gt;&gt; keyboard comparison (your synthesizer&apos;s approximation of 969&#xFFFD; will<br/>suffice<br/>&gt;&gt; to prove my point), or perhaps someone can perform an analysis.</p><p>&gt;And I&apos;m positive Chandra&apos;s seventh is _way lower than 12-tET. It was the<br/>&gt;first thing I noticed when I first played it. Again, I haven&apos;t measured it.<br/>&gt;I assumed it to be a 4:7 because it sure wasn&apos;t a keyboard tuning.<br/>&gt;Furthermore, she tunes it that way consistently throughout the song. Also,<br/>&gt;it sounds exactly like the &quot;low&quot; seventh all through my Indian music<br/>&gt;recordings. Why would it not be a 4:7?</p><p>Remember how you said the &quot;high third&quot; of a major triad sounded exactly like<br/>the interval between the 7th and 9th of a 4:5:6:7:9 chord? And then you<br/>ended up concluding that it wasn&apos;t? Perhaps the same thing is going on here.<br/>Anyway, make the comparison: I&apos;m confident in my perception.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t hear this at all and in fact the last note appears to be a major<br/>&gt;&gt; seventh, not a third, over the tonic (maybe I&apos;m hearing a phantom root).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Listen again, Paul. Her last note is a third, both in the context of the<br/>&gt;song as a whole and within the final tonic chord. Sing along with her and<br/>&gt;you&apos;ll hear (and feel) her pitch change just as the tonic chord arrives.</p><p>You only posted the end of the song, so I can&apos;t get a sense of the key. My<br/>Altec speakers must suck, since I really hear the last chord as a major 9th<br/>chord with the soprano singing the major 7th. I do hear the tiny upward<br/>shift today. Would you mind giving the notes for the last few chords?</p></div>
