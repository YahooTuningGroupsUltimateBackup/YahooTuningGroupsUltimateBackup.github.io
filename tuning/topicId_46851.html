String and soundboard vibration<br/>are<br/>    calculated using an equivalent circuit. Each string is comprised<br/>of<br/>    resonance circuits that correspond to partials, and the behaviors<br/>of<br/>    individual partials are described independently of each other<br/>by<br/>    these circuits. When the most simplified version of only one<br/>partial<br/>    is considered, the equivalent circuit is expressed by the<br/>two<br/>    resonant circuits coupled with the soundboard impedance. The<br/>degree<br/>    of coupling between the two strings is dependent on the ratio of<br/>two<br/>    constants: the degree of mistuning and the ratio of<br/>soundboard<br/>    impedance to string impedance. If the former is smaller than<br/>the<br/>    latter, the two strings are closely coupled with each other and<br/>a<br/>    double decay characteristic results. If the relation between the<br/>two<br/>    constants is reversed, the coupling is loose and a beat type of<br/>decay<br/>    characteristic results. The decay characteristics are changed by<br/>the<br/>    above two constants. The results show that the degree of tuning<br/>and<br/>    the characteristics of the strings and the soundboard determine<br/>the<br/>    decay characteristics of piano<br/>sound.<br/>CC<br/>*4375</p><p>CT  SOUND WAVES; *COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; *MUSICAL<br/>INSTRUMENTS;<br/>    *ACOUSTICS; STRINGS; COUPLING; ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE;<br/>EQUIVALENT<br/>    CIRCUITS</p></div>
