I&apos;ve asked music teachers of<br/>mine about that, who&apos;ve said that in their whole experience, I was<br/>unique. Most kids start out liking Mozart and Haydn and Bach and<br/>Schubert, and then gradually they like more advanced 20th-century<br/>composers. But right from the beginning I loved Stravinsky,<br/>Schoenberg.&quot;</p><p>While it would be misleading for me to say exactly the same of myself,<br/>as it took me a while to even find whatever wasn&apos;t easily available to<br/>me through the usual blue-collar, middleclass kid in a small-town<br/>channels, I did take to dissonance right off the bat through my own<br/>initial fumblings at the guitar. In fact, I vividly remember getting<br/>one of those simple open-chord charts and thinking to myself, &apos;boy,<br/>all these seem to sound much better if I slide the fretted notes up or<br/>down a fret...&apos; And indeed they did!, though it would take me an<br/>awfully long time to find anybody else who seemed to think so...</p><p>Tilson Thomas goes on to say...</p><p>&quot;The kind of people who will be coming to this festival are people who<br/>are much more associated with a lot of alternative music, whether<br/>coming from funk, blues, jazz, fusion, or electronic music. They&apos;re<br/>the people who enjoyed the Metallica concerts that they did with the<br/>symphony, people who are fans of the Grateful Dead and Phish, and<br/>groups that pushed the limit of that sort of jam, free-zone kind of<br/>thing. These are all people who will love this festival, and we want<br/>to get the word out to them.&quot;</p><p>You can just tell that he&apos;s thinking something along the lines of &apos;I<br/>just know this music can excite those kids just the way it did for me<br/>if we can just get it out there to them...&apos; And in a way I think he&apos;s<br/>right, as I&apos;ve often thought the very same sorta things myself, but<br/>many years of banging my head against a similar wall tell me that it<br/>would appear to be a much bigger leap than it necessarily appears on<br/>the surface of it... as I have to believe that the vast majority of<br/>folks seem to follow the surface or ephemera of a given thing then<br/>they do the bedrock fundamental oomph of it; in other words if one<br/>thing ain&apos;t another thing at face value, don&apos;t bet the farm on any<br/>mass revelations!</p><p>Anyway, interesting stuff...</p><p>straight from the meting pot,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>BTW, I think most here will probably look at the short list of<br/>&quot;mavericks&quot; and say something like I did, &quot;what!, no Partch?&quot; But<br/>Tilson Thomas addresses this pretty quickly in the interview, and I&apos;m<br/>wondering if anyone here knows if any serious attempt was actually<br/>made to get the Partch instruments for a performance (etc.), or is<br/>what he says just the common word on the street so to speak...<br/>anybody?</p></div><h3><a id=17088 href="#17088">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2001 10:58:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16881">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16881</a></p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s an interesting bit from a <a href="http://sonicnet.com">sonicnet.com</a> interview with Michael<br/>&gt; Tilson Thomas regarding his American Mavericks series...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.sonicnet.com/classical/features/Thomas,_Tilson/060500/">http://www.sonicnet.com/classical/features/Thomas,_Tilson/060500/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I&apos;ve always loved dissonant, very rhythmic, aggressive,<br/>mold-breaking music, from the time I was a small child.

Ben Johnston<br/>performed his arrangement of Partch&apos;s Barstow with the Kronos Quartet. That<br/>was around the time that controversy was beaten to death here on the list<br/>-- perhaps it even precipitated the discussion, I don&apos;t recall. Anyway, on<br/>the same concert were pieces of Antheil, Cowell, Harrison, Meredith Monk,<br/>Steve Reich, and others. It ended up with MTT jamming with the Grateful<br/>Dead on themes of Cowell. It was a 3-hour show played to a packed house.<br/>(To be fair, a sizable fraction of the audience were tie-dyed Deadheads,<br/>but their response to the rest of the program was no less enthusiastic.)</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
