It&apos;s the fault of the NY Times.  They&apos;re<br/>easy targets, anyway... There wasn&apos;t much written about it.  How much does<br/>such a unit cost??  And thanks, Clark, for your URL, and the Tunelab97.  I<br/>did look at the Website.  I would *DEFINITELY* need a laptop, though.<br/>Could you imagine the &quot;klutz&quot; who would schlepp his desktop around??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p><p>_____________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8707 href="#8707">ðŸ”—</a>A440A@aol.com</h3><span>2/19/2000 8:06:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;&lt; the Sanderson</p><p>Accu-Tuner [Ed Foote TD 540:1]...

For a working tuner, it is a very<br/>cheap piece of equipment, for others, it may be a little steep.  I love mine.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
