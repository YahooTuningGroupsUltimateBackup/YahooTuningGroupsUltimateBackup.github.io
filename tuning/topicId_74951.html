In<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma or 1/3-comma meantone, for example, one of the thirds<br/>&gt; is pure while the other one is tempered by 1/4 or 1/3-comma,<br/>&gt; respectively.

The same goes for the superpyth which I used on the<br/>&gt; recording where the generator is (3200/3)^(1/17).</p><p>This generator is very close to a generator of 7-limit TOP<br/>superpyth.  Are you using it with a pure octave?</p><p>By the way, I found your notation here confusing.  You mean<br/>3200 cents (right?), so you don&apos;t want the 17th root.  Rather,<br/>just 3200/51.</p><p>As far as allowing less mistuning on epimoric ratios, I&apos;ll<br/>have to think about that.  The usual approach has been to<br/>preferentially reduce the mistuning of *simple* ratios, which<br/>favors 3/2, 5/4, and 7/4 over 6/5, 7/5, and 7/6.</p><p>It sounds like your overall goal is to minimize the beat rates<br/>of your intervals.  Is that right?  If so, I&apos;m not aware of<br/>any direct attempt to solve that for 7-limit linear<br/>temperaments.  It is an interesting proposition.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=74967 href="#74967">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2008 2:10:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>though I&apos;m back on the list now, I won&apos;t repost my previous message as I&apos;ve successfully deleted it so I&apos;ll respond to your newest words now.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see how epimores / guide tones are important here.<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t it just that smaller intervals are liable to beat faster<br/>&gt; when mistuned by a fixed amount?</p><p>I don&apos;t know how to explain why it sounds to me like the beats in the epimoric intervals were somewhat clearer sometimes but I&apos;ve experienced this more times. I&apos;ll have to play around with it to see if I can reach any meaningful conclusion. As to the guide tones, their beats get faster as their pitches get higher. If you play 4:5:6, then the guide tone of the major third is 20 and the one for the minor third is 30 (which is 50% higher). If you leave the fifth pure and shift the middle tone either slightly up or down, then the minor third will beat 50% faster than the major third.</p><p>&gt; In that case, I&apos;d suggest<br/>&gt; what might be called &quot;inverse Tenney weighting&quot;.  In any<br/>&gt; harmonic limit, the most complex ratios are the smallest.<br/>&gt; So whereas Tenney weighting preferentially distributes error<br/>&gt; to the simple intervals, you want to distribute it to the<br/>&gt; complex ones.</p><p>Sounds interesting.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=74968 href="#74968">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2008 8:59:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; though I&apos;m back on the list now, I won&apos;t repost my previous<br/>&gt; message as I&apos;ve successfully deleted it so I&apos;ll respond to your<br/>&gt; newest words now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t see how epimores / guide tones are important here.<br/>&gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t it just that smaller intervals are liable to beat faster<br/>&gt; &gt; when mistuned by a fixed amount?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how to explain why it sounds to me like the beats in<br/>&gt; the epimoric intervals were somewhat clearer sometimes but I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; experienced this more times.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, epimores are by nature the smallest intervals<br/>of a given limit.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll have to play around with it to<br/>&gt; see if I can reach any meaningful conclusion.</p><p>Let us know what you find.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
