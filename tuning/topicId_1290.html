But this method would probably not work<br/>on the piano, because of the tension involved.  At best, the machinery<br/>needed to accurately control that type of tension would be at least as<br/>space-consuming as more strings.</p><p>If we want a mechanical linkage, we seem to be confined to a single plane,<br/>and the maximum seems to be around 33 notes per octave (on a small<br/>fortepiano), which should be enough to pacify most of us.</p><p>If we allow an electric action to stimulate the strings, we can have boxes<br/>of them placed around the room, so there&apos;s really no limit.  Sort of a pipe<br/>organ (the ultimate microtonal instrument) for string lovers.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
