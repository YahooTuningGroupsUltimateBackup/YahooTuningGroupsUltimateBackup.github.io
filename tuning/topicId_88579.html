These lead to situations where a difference tone between two terms are related to a third. Does anyone have an opinion on the audible significance of this? If it is significant, generators which are good ones for linear temperaments and which derive from a suitable three-term polynomial would be particularly interesting, though I still don&apos;t see why you need the recurrences and don&apos;t simply use the positive root &gt; 1 of the polynomial as a generator.</p></div><h3><a id=88580 href="#88580">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2010 6:54:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was complaining that the use of recurrences wasn&apos;t clearly<br/>&gt; motivated, but just now looking at the characteristic polynomials<br/>&gt; Jacques lists I keep finding three term polynomials, which define<br/>&gt; three term linear recurrences.
