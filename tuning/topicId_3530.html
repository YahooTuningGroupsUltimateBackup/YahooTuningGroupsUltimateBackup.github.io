Not only did I read it, but I attempted to<br/>re-create some of his simpler results using my own synthesizer and spectrum<br/>analyzer.</p><p>If I understand correctly, the bulk of Sethares&apos; work is based on a computed<br/>value for sensory dissonance of sets of complex tones.  The general method<br/>for computing the sensory dissonance for a set of complex tones is to add up<br/>the dissonance of each pair of harmonics present in the tones.  The<br/>dissonance of the harmonic pairs is computed based on experimentation<br/>performed by Plomp and Levelt back in 1965.</p><p>Sethares&apos; book presents a discussion of these experiments, along with some<br/>audio demonstrations on an accompanying CD.  It is these demonstrations,<br/>along with the interpretation, that don&apos;t match what I perceive.  I was<br/>hoping that someone would straighten me out so I can understand the rest of<br/>Sethares&apos; theories better.  As a software engineer, I am keenly interested<br/>in implementing the adaptive tuning algorithms that Sethares describes<br/>towards the end of his book.</p><p>#########################################</p><p>So here we go:</p><p>Sethares presents an audio track that demonstrates &quot;a sine wave of frequency<br/>220 Hz together with a wave of variable frequency beginning at 220 Hz and<br/>slowly increasing [over 60 seconds] to 470 Hz.&quot; [Page 43, TTSS]</p><p>In his discussion of this audio sample, he states that people generally<br/>perceive &quot;pleasant beating (at small frequency ratios), roughness (at middle<br/>ratios), and separation into two tones (at first with roughness, and later<br/>without) for larger ratios.&quot; [Page 44]  Furthermore &quot;the dissonance is<br/>minimum when both sine waves are of the same frequency, increases rapidly to<br/>its maximum somewhere near one quarter of the critical bandwidth, and then<br/>decreases steadily back towards zero.&quot; [Page 44]</p><p>From the graphics that are connected to this text (the &quot;Plomp-Levelt curves&quot;<br/>on pages 44 and 45), it is clear that the above description is meant to<br/>apply to the entire interval from the base tone (220 Hz in this example) to<br/>its next higher octave (440 Hz) and beyond.</p><p>An amplitude graph of the two added signals is shown at the top of page 44.<br/>No scale is provided for the graph&apos;s x-axis, the time axis.  The graph shows<br/>an envelope with a very wide &quot;beat&quot; at the beginning, followed by series of<br/>decreasing duration size beats (correponding to the increase in the<br/>frequency difference between the two signals over time), followed eventually<br/>by beats that are too frequent to be visible at the resolution of the graph.</p><p>Now here is my disagreement:  Through different degrees of holistic vs.<br/>analytical listening to the subject sound sample, I simply hear something<br/>different than what Sethares (and Plomp and Levelt) describe.</p><p>When I listen to this sound sample, I do indeed hear the &quot;fusion -&gt;<br/>beating -&gt; roughness -&gt; separation&quot; pattern described by Sethares. (Sounds<br/>like a recipe for a bad marriage.)  However, this pattern ends when the<br/>second (sweep) tone reaches about 300 Hz.  After that, I hear the reverse<br/>pattern: &quot;separation -&gt; roughness -&gt; beating -&gt; fusion&quot;.  This reverse<br/>pattern continues until 330 Hz (i.e. 3/2 of the base frequency), and then<br/>the entire pattern repeats again<br/>&quot;fusion-&gt;beating-&gt;roughness-&gt;separation-&gt;roughness-&gt;beating-&gt;fusion&quot;, ending<br/>at 440 Hz (i.e. 2 times the base frequency).  A little bit of beating and<br/>roughness then proceeds until 470 Hz, when the sound sample ends. (Wow, this<br/>really sounds violent.)</p><p>At the same time, I perceive a &quot;difference&quot; tone.  This difference tone is<br/>not audible at first, but just about the time that beating first turns to<br/>roughness I start to hear it (probably when the frequency difference of the<br/>two waves exceeds 50Hz, the lowest frequency my computer&apos;s speakers will<br/>reproduce.)  The difference tone slowly increases in frequency until the<br/>sweep tone reaches 330 Hz, at which point the difference tone is 110 Hz.<br/>Then, as the sweep tone progresses from 330 Hz to 440 Hz, the perceived<br/>difference tone&apos;s pitch decreases to the point that it is inaudible (just<br/>when the &quot;beating&quot; phase leading up to 440 Hz begins).</p><p>At the same time, during each of the &quot;separation&quot; phases, I perceive a<br/>periodic increase/decrease in another quality of the sound.  I don&apos;t know<br/>what to call this quality, but it sounds similar to pulse-width modulation.<br/>This modulation occurs on the order of once every five seconds during the<br/>60-second sample.</p><p>Sethares explains that Plomp and Levelt were careful to use only musical<br/>novices in their listening experiments.  The stated reason for this was that<br/>&quot;musically trained listeners often recognize intervals and report their<br/>learned musical responses rather than their actual perceptions&quot;.</p><p>With the possible exception of my third observation about periodically<br/>increasing/decreasing &quot;pulse width modulation&quot;, I do not think that my<br/>minimal musical training could be affecting my perceptions.  However, to<br/>make sure that this was the case, I used a spectrum analysis package to view<br/>both the spectrum and waveform of the combined signal.</p><p>The repeating cycle of fusion -&gt; separation -&gt; fusion that I heard is quite<br/>easily visible in the resulting waveform graph.  I was able to produce a<br/>graph just like the one shown at the top of page 44, except that the graph<br/>on the top of page 44 only covers the portion of the sound sample<br/>corresponding to the sweep tone ranging from 220 to about 250 Hz.  This is<br/>misleading, since this only shows one small section of the<br/>fusion-separation-fusion cycle, which actually repeats two full times in the<br/>sound sample.   The 220-250 Hz region of the waveform amplitude graph does<br/>indeed match what is shown in the Plomp-Levelt curve.  The remaining<br/>sections of the graph (not shown in Sethares&apos; book) seem to refute the<br/>Plomp-Levelt curve.</p><p>Let&apos;s take a specific example:  Take the pair of pure sine waves at 220 Hz<br/>and 420 Hz.  This is clearly in the region of the Plomp-Levelt curve in<br/>which the dissonance should be approaching very near zero.  However, when I<br/>listen to this pair of tones, I clearly perceive a very strong dissonance.<br/>In other words, it is not just the intervals around the 1:1 ratio that are<br/>very dissonant, but also the intervals around 2:1.  In fact, the intervals<br/>around 3:2 also produce dissonance, albeit not as bad.  On the other hand, I<br/>can&apos;t say I was able to hear much dissonance around the higher-numbered<br/>intervals (4:3, 5:4, 5:3, etc.)</p><p>I am trying to figure out where this discrepancy comes from.  It seems very<br/>clear to me that dissonance does _not_ decrease continuously as the interval<br/>increases, even for pure tones.  If this is true, first of all this would<br/>mean that Plomp and Levelt were wrong, which I doubt.  Furthermore, it<br/>throws all of Sethares&apos; results out the window, too, since he uses the<br/>Plomp-Levolt curves for his own calculations of sensory dissonance.  Since<br/>the other musical samples that Sethares provides with his book are<br/>persuasive, I conclude that I must be getting something wrong.</p><p>Is the dissonance I am hearing an artifact of my sound system?  I don&apos;t<br/>think so.  As I said, if I use spectrum analysis software to examine the<br/>resulting waveforms, I can clearly see lots of amplitute beats going on<br/>around the 1:1, 2:1, and 3:2 intervals, corresponding to the dissonance I<br/>hear.</p><p>I have lots more specific details about the spectral analysis, but I am sure<br/>by now I have belabored my point.  Can anyone explain to me if I am<br/>misinterpreting the Plomp-Levelt results, or what is going wrong with my<br/>analysis?  Does anyone have time to synthesize the 220 Hz plus 220 Hz-to-470<br/>Hz sweep sine wave, listen to the result, and tell me if they hear the same<br/>thing that I do?</p><p>Thank you very much for your time</p><p>Tim Crews<br/><a href="mailto:timcrews@home.com">timcrews@home.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3531 href="#3531">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@apple.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/1999 5:20:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You hear what I hear, I think, from your descripion.

I know of no instance of it referring to a<br/>full octave, as the above seems to read.  (Am I missing<br/>something?)  The critical<br/>bandwidth varies a little with frequency.  But not that<br/>much!  And the idea that a minor 3rd is the most dissonant<br/>interval that 2 sines can make seems ridiculous.  Why his<br/>graph appears to show the phenomenon over an octave beats<br/>me (oops, NPI!).  Perhaps he&apos;s using it, or some other term,<br/>differently.</p><p>Specifically, the term as I know of it applies to the<br/>bandwidth around any given frequency within which other<br/>tones can at least partially mask it, and it them.  &quot;Mask&quot;<br/>is acoustician speak for &quot;drown out.&quot;  For most of the human<br/>hearing spectrum, that bandwidth is somewhere around 1/3<br/>octave, and is more-or-less bell shaped.  That partially<br/>explains why 1/3 octave graphic equalizers are pervasive in<br/>sound reinforcement.  The rest of the reason is that they<br/>look really impressive with all those colored sliders.</p><p>One quarter of the critical bandwidth should be around 100<br/>cents, a value which would fit most Westerners&apos; ideas of<br/>maximum dissonance, at least.  Alternatively, he might have<br/>meant that when the band is _centered_ on 220, moving the<br/>other sine 1/4 of<br/>the way from there to the edge of the band, about 50 cents<br/>give or take a few, produces maximum dissonance.  I don&apos;t<br/>know which of those best fits other definitions/calculations<br/>of dissonance betwixt sine waves.</p><p>In those cases, I can see where the dissonance curve for<br/>sines might fall to near zero outside of the critical band,<br/>even for near-Just intervals.  That would be strictly<br/>outside of, and virtually irrelevant to, a musical context,<br/>of course.  Once you start combining notes in a composition,<br/>regardless of the spectral characteristics of the<br/>instruments, the whole perspective on consonance/dissonance<br/>changes to meet the theory behind the music.</p><p>If you&apos;re hearing sines beating at intervals larger than<br/>about 6/5, it&apos;s probably due to:</p><p>1) non-linearities in your sound reproduction system (using<br/>typical &quot;multimedia&quot; computer speakers guarantees this for<br/>frequencies below about 500 Hz) generating harmonic partials<br/>2) extraneous sounds in your listening environment -- any<br/>fans running nearby, such as in your CPU?

I would think that the techniques discussed in this section<br/>&gt; would allow you to move dissonance partials to more suitable (i.e. more<br/>&gt; nearly harmonic) locations, so that the _inherent_ dissonance of a sound<br/>&gt; is minimized, while hopefully retaining the basic character of the sound.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s really what chapter 11 is all about.</p><p>That approach is correct in spirit, but I have a feeling that there&apos;s a<br/>much more direct way of controlling it by using the relative phases of<br/>different harmonics - The relative phases of two pure sine waves don&apos;t<br/>matter except close to 1:1, but with more they start to matter a lot, and<br/>TTSS for the most part just lets them fall where they may.</p><p>One reason I like the theory in TTSS is that it generally indicates that<br/>the number of timbres which sound fundamentally not of this earth<br/>completely dwarfs the number which do, which is an intuitive notion I&apos;ve<br/>had for a *long* time.</p><p>-Bram</p></div><h3><a id=3568 href="#3568">ðŸ”—</a>Tim Crews &#x3C;timcrews@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/1999 5:30:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi David:</p><p>   You are the first person to suggest that the<br/>phenomena that I am hearing are a result of my sound<br/>system.
