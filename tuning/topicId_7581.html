And moreover, having abandoned the<br/>seven-stringed kithara, he added an eleventh string, thus promulgating<br/>excesses.  One grave citizen, upon seeing this, feared to disclose anything<br/>of such inharmonious extensions in Sparta, lest perchance it alarm a great<br/>controversy.&quot;</p><p>If I were to identify with and imagine myself as approaching a modern-day<br/>Timothius (albeit on bassoon), there are some - even on this list - that<br/>would exile this poor New Yorker.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
