His ideas about<br/>the relationship between scales and vowel sets are very interesting and I<br/>think point to a information theory based description of musical scales and<br/>intonational systems.  This seems like a fruitful avenue for further<br/>research.<br/>&#x9;From our discussion it tends to seem like we&apos;re retreading beaten paths<br/>but I&apos;m not so sure.  Certainly many people have noticed the mathematical<br/>properties of 5 7 12 and its extension to 19 31, but I think looking at<br/>these scales in new ways may lead to new insights about the nature of<br/>scales and the music based on them.  Using Rothenberg&apos;s calculations is one<br/>way of looking at these scales in a new way, but in our discussion its<br/>becoming increasingly evident to me that I&apos;m beginning to diverge from<br/>Rothenberg in my use of his ideas.  Hopefully this will all become more<br/>clear further on . . .<br/>&#x9;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m assuming propriety to be derived from relations in the scale<br/>&gt;&gt;constructed by the listener, not relations between absolute pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can you elaborate?</p><p>&#x9;This is simply to say that the human ear and mind do not necessarily act<br/>like a frequency analyser.  There&apos;s only a certain degree to which actual<br/>frequencies are relevant to the percieved relationships of pitches.  In<br/>fact, &quot;actual&quot; frequency is an ambiguous term--we have to decide what<br/>determines what we call the actual freq: maybe a reading on a guitar tuner<br/>sort of device.  In that case I would say taking an electric tuner to a<br/>concert and trying to experience the music by watching the needle go up and<br/>down (presumably to make sure your hearing correctly) would be like trying<br/>to do a simple algebra problem with Russel&apos;s predicate calculus.</p><p>&gt;&gt; If<br/>&gt;&gt;the listener has 12 notes in his 8ve (which will presumably be the case for<br/>&gt;&gt;Western music which is not completely diatonic), then a tritone is a<br/>&gt;&gt;tritone, whether or not the scale is tuned as a Pythagorean or Just 12-tone<br/>&gt;&gt;scale.  Certainly a Pythagorean diatonic doesn&apos;t have the effect of an<br/>&gt;&gt;improper scale, but in terms of absolute pitches, it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Do we need to modify the definition of propriety? Would this modification<br/>&gt;have any bearing on your definition of the &quot;best&quot; generator?</p><p>&#x9;I think you may be right.  I&apos;m taking the basic concepts which make the<br/>calculation of propriety valuable to be those ideas of Helmholtz&apos;s which<br/>Rothenberg discusses at the beginning of his Math. Sys. Theory article.  A<br/>musical scale acts in some sense like a machinist&apos;s scale: it allows us to<br/>measure the distance between two tones on that scale.  If the greatest<br/>precision I could want in measuring intervals is such that there are twelve<br/>distinct intervals in an 8ve, then I can think about actual tones in terms<br/>of twelve categories.  But if, at a particular moment, the music I hear is<br/>completely diatonic, then, because the diatonic scale is proper in the<br/>system of twelve tones, I can simplify my representation of tonal space<br/>into a scale of seven tones where the unit of measurement is the diatonic<br/>step.  As we extend the scale to include more tones, we get a series of<br/>embedded scales.  19 as a subset of 31 is 2122122121221221221 which<br/>contains a 12-note subset, 323233232323 expressed in the scale of 31 or<br/>212122121212 in the scale of 19, which contains a 7-note subset 5535553 or<br/>3323332 or 2212221 or 1111111.  The tonal interest of the music comes from<br/>the existence of such embedded scales.  The method of calculating propriety<br/>doesn&apos;t need to change, I don&apos;t think, but if faced with a set of real<br/>pitches converted by means of an electronic freq analyzer, the first<br/>question to ask would not be &quot;is this scale proper&quot; but &quot;is this scale<br/>proper in a system of n pitches per 8ve.&quot;  The same goes for a set of<br/>pitches described in a different mathematical system, such as the<br/>pythagorean diatonic.  This scale would be proper in a 12 tone system but<br/>improper in a 17 note system.  I&apos;m taking for granted a method of<br/>translation which I need to define more precisely.  The criteria for a good<br/>translation from, say, a set of heard pitches to a scale of n tones would<br/>be that intervals between pitches which are heard as the same get the same<br/>measurement on the scale.  If we choose any arbitrary number for n we&apos;re<br/>likely to get many bad fits.  A bad fit could correspond to an impression<br/>of out-of-tuneness: if I insist on representing a set of heard pitches in a<br/>twelve-note system into which they refuse to fit (and the contradictory<br/>intervals are made obvious to me by the music) then I will characterize the<br/>music as out-of-tune.  That&apos;s not to say that &quot;out-of-tune&quot; doesn&apos;t<br/>sometimes refer to a deviation from just intervals: we may use the same<br/>term to describe two different phenomena.</p><p>&gt;The Kornerup golden fifth is even nearer to the optimal meantone fifth<br/>&gt;(i.e., the optimal fifth for triadic harmony). See the table about 3/5 of<br/>&gt;the way down the page <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm</a> --<br/>&gt;observe how very close the optimal meantone fifths are to the Kornerup<br/>&gt;Golden fifth at 696.21 cents. See also the table at the bottom of the page.<br/>&gt;Anyhow, the Kornerup fifth (like the Harrison/LucyTuning fifth) is so near<br/>&gt;as to be indistinguishable from fifths with musically relevant properties.<br/>&gt;That&apos;s as close as I&apos;m willing to come to saying it&apos;s musically relevant.</p><p>&#x9;So what you&apos;re saying here is, the Kornerup fifth is relevant only to such<br/>a degree that it&apos;s replaceable by the pure fifth or the common meantone<br/>fifths.  If it were especially relevant musically than only an extension to<br/>50 or 81 pitches would distinguish it&apos;s properties from those of the<br/>meantone fifths.  And on the implicit premise that systems of 50 or 81<br/>pitches don&apos;t seem like a payoff in terms of the musical richness of the<br/>systems, I would agree with you.  I like the Yasser sequence up to 31 but<br/>if we extend it to 50 or 81 pitches I start to question the usefulness of<br/>this.  I&apos;m not settled on this point though.  Systems of 50 and 81 tones<br/>are purely theoretical to me, so my intuitions about them are as irrelevant<br/>as they are to any music I know.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I concur again.  I&apos;m way off the mark if my analysis points out the 2^phi<br/>&gt;&gt;generated scales as special.  And clearly, it&apos;s cardinality numbers are<br/>&gt;&gt;lower with respect to their positions in the series than any other similar<br/>&gt;&gt;series, since it begins with the lowest numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, as I showed in my post earlier today, that appears incorrect. Calling<br/>&gt;the 2^phi case &quot;Phibonacci&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Phibonacci 1  2  3  5  8  13 21 34 55 89 . . .<br/>&gt;Kornerup   1  2  3  5  7  12 19 31 50 81 . . .<br/>&gt;Lucas      1  2  3  4  7  11 18 29 47 76 . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So in fact, Phibonacci&apos;s points of propriety are higher numbers with respect<br/>&gt;to their positions than those of Kornerup&apos;s golden fifth. However, the Lucas<br/>&gt;generator of 868.33 cents has got both of them beat.</p><p>&#x9;I would propose a different way of looking at this problem.  I must say<br/>that continued fractions don&apos;t strike me as the most useful way to<br/>represent it.  They&apos;re useful for finding a noble number which the<br/>successive generators approach, but for looking at proper scales which are<br/>members of the sequence, I find the following representation simpler and<br/>more descriptive.  We&apos;re considering sequences of numbers which follow the<br/>rule: the last member of the series at any point is the sum of the previous<br/>number and some earlier number in the series.  Then we consider sequences<br/>where the latter number must be the number only two places previous in the<br/>series.  In this case the first two numbers of the series define the entire<br/>series, Phibonacci&apos;s minimizes the magnitude of the numbers with respect to<br/>their place in the series (we have to add certain constraints which exclude<br/>irrelevant sequences: the second number must be greater than the first, the<br/>first number is never 1, in which case the Phibonacci sequence is 2, 3, 5 .<br/>. . but still has the property in question), and the Lucas sequence fails<br/>the stronger criteria but can be replaced by 3, 4, 7, 11 . . . which<br/>satisfies them.   The sequence with the least numbers per place satifying<br/>the weaker criteria is the natural numbers.  An interesting sequence<br/>failing the stronger but satisfying the weaker criteria is the sequence of<br/>MOS&apos;s of the pure 5th generator which Pierre mentioned, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 17,<br/>29, 41 . . .</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d be interested in seeing your efficiency analysis and also analyzing the<br/>&gt;Lucas scales I posted about today on the basis of efficiency. Actually, I<br/>&gt;was going to guess the opposite -- that the Phibonacci generator is best<br/>&gt;with regard to efficiency.</p><p>It&apos;s still in the works, but I&apos;ll post my results when I come up with<br/>anything.  There may also be other properties to look at, because with the<br/>method of beginning with two arbitrary numbers and making a sequence which<br/>satisfies the strong criteria, some predictable patterns develop in the<br/>scales.</p><p>jason</p></div>
