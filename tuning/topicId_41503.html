It is possibly fruitful line of investigation and many have gotten something out of it. To me it seemed disproportional considering our line of investigation. If i were interested in<br/>serialism, the investigation of other world music would provide few meaningful models. So i was not making a blanket berating of western Culture just what appears to be a disproportional balence in the line of investigations.<br/>    There are no &quot;pure&quot; musical cultures and most have developed by interaction with the music of their neighbors , colonialist or even enemies as you have pointed out and in the past served as part of an important identity. As we get older as a race and transportation being what it is, the amount of mixture and a comunication between different groups is on the rise.<br/>    But you reminded me of one of my favorite quotes is by Goethe who states.(paraphrase)</p><p>     A person can not do anything of any worth unless they isolates themselves.</p><p>And this is how these different musics developed in some form of isolation. and the best composers likewise.<br/>we each can only be true to our own callings and the natural directions from which we grow and like a tree we will always have our roots in the same place from where we started. There will always be western music that by its own accord will have nothing to learn from elements outside of it s own culture (maybe ). You imply that my work might be a synthesis of various cultures. Possibly it might be seem that way but<br/>the process has been more of already doing something in a certain way and finding this done places I had not realize. Without knowing this though might have resulted in failing to recognize its full worth. . Regardless of what i know of other cultures the gap is always wider in some respects than we imagine and usually lead to mistakes. We should not be afraid of making mistakes for this is always the first step.<br/>We have to accept that others tribes  interpeted in the context of where we are in our own other and inner tribe. These interactions are subtle just how they are of the exchange of ideas even within a single culture will manifest in variation.<br/>    One point we cannot overlook or i can not overlook is that all these cultures are not on a same footing. Western culture has no possibility of become exsinct yet many world musics are in the same way that various plants are being destroyed be fore they can even be cataloged. And at least this needs to be done in a way more rigorous than ethnomusicology seemed inclined. So yes i am inclined as a music maker<br/>(folk musician i imagine)  or being interest in preserving as well as creating music. To use what is foriegn and outside of  us would be a mistake but to ignore or discover the &quot;foriegn within&quot; oneself and ignore it is a crime against one own being.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: Christopher Bailey &lt;<a href="mailto:cb202@columbia.edu">cb202@columbia.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone else see the irony in berating Western-culture for not<br/>&gt; embracing the other musics of the world, when many of those very musics<br/>&gt; developed to their great heights by remaining isolated themselves?
