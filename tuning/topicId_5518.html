Multiple the active string length by two to get the<br/>   effective string length to use for fret calculation with whatever<br/>   ratios you want.</p><p>*  For a 12-TET fretboard he mentions a &quot;rule of 18&quot; in which each fret<br/>   is placed 1/18th of the remaining string length away from the<br/>   previous fret.  This apparently has the effect of compensating for<br/>   the change in tension when pressing the string to the fretboard.</p><p>   For comparison:<br/>   2^(-1/12) = 0.943874312681693...<br/>   17/18     = 0.944444444444444...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
