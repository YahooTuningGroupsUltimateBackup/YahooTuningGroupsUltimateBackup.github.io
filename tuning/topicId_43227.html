I&apos;d rather<br/>&gt; take the evidence of usage over any &apos;theory articles.&apos;<br/>&gt; Anyone got a Haas or Nowak of the Bruckner and would<br/>&gt; like to check also.</p><p>what&apos;s your &quot;Mahler ed&quot;?  if you&apos;re referring to the<br/>Mahler scores as published in the &quot;Critical Edition&quot;,<br/>please note my quotation marks.  there&apos;s more on this<br/>below ...</p><p>&gt; The only fly in this ointment is whether meantone<br/>&gt; piano tuning would have influenced Mahler&apos;s writing.</p><p>my guess is that by the time Mahler was playing piano<br/>as a youth (1870s) meantone was pretty much out of the<br/>picture, and the pianos on which he played were most<br/>likely intended to be tuned in 12edo, or *possibly*<br/>some form of well-temperament.</p><p>&gt; Bruckner would almost certainly know ji from writing<br/>&gt; his masses and providing the brass parts.</p><p>that&apos;s a very intriguing comment, but also see<br/>my remarks about Bruckner and JI above.</p><p>but here&apos;s the *real* &quot;fly in the ointment&quot;:  it&apos;s<br/>on record that Mahler lamented the loss of meantone<br/>as a tuning paradigm, in a statement he made to Schoenberg<br/>presumably around 1905 (as recorded by Peter Yates in<br/>an article published in _Soundings_).  Mahler complained<br/>about &quot;the loss of harmonic possibilities&quot;.</p><p>Mahler often wrote in keys with a lot of sharps, and in<br/>his manuscripts, these passages often contain double-sharps<br/>which have been silently transformed into their 12edo<br/>&quot;natural&quot; enharmonic equivalents, supposedly for &quot;easier<br/>reading&quot;.  i consider this to be a sacrilege, in that it<br/>distorts the subtle harmonic nuances Mahler intended if<br/>he had meantone in mind, which i think he did in at least<br/>some passages in his symphonies.  and by far the vast<br/>majority of his output is for orchestra, which has flexible<br/>intonation.</p><p>so if meantone was no longer used on pianos by Mahler&apos;s<br/>time, why was he so fascinated with that form of tuning?<br/>the puzzle i&apos;ve pieced together is that Josef Petzval was<br/>lecturing on 31edo and meantone at Vienna University at<br/>precisely the time Mahler attended that school, and Petzval<br/>had even had a piano tuned in 31edo and had also built an<br/>instrument so tuned of his own invention called a &quot;guitharp&quot;,<br/>both of which he used in his demonstrations of meantone.</p><p>-monz<br/>(last post before my vacation in Miami)</p></div>
