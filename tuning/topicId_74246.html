(I.e. what distinguishes this from polyphony?<br/>&gt; This refers also to our Jimi.) Actually I was only going to ask what actual scales you use from the tuning in the other thread (My hunch being pentatonic because the note names sound Japanese, but the word that&apos;s supposed to mean &quot;dark&quot; is not in my [tiny] dictionary). Please answer in that other thread.</p><p>The main problem with the 4 -phonies is that they were coined for written music in a period when clearer distinctions were made - except for heterophony, which came much later and was invented to describe unwritten music, a performance practice rather than a species of counterpoint.</p><p>This might be what they are in order of complexity:</p><p>Monophony: Just a melody without accompaniment, delivered by one person alone or by a group that knows the melody well enough and is not interested in self-expression. A cantor, or a group of sports fans.</p><p>Heterophony is polyphony (!) that arises when a group of people sing the same melody, but are free to contribute their own embellishments individually. Say, someone likes an appoggiatura, another likes to exaggerate a leap, some like a strict tempo, some don&apos;t. To be heard on many anthropological recordings (from a time when the key question was, Where does polyphony come from, and heterophony was &quot;invented&quot; as the missing link), or Gy&iuml;&iquest;&half;rgy Ligeti from the &apos;70s onward (written down, in this case). Or theme statements in Albert Ayler&apos;s groups.</p><p>Polyphony and homophony are two contrapuntal styles, the latter often called &quot;rhythmic unison&quot; to please the plebs. They rarely occur separate from each other. In a mass, the Kyrie with its six words is more likely to be polyphonic, with imitations and independent, equally conspicuous voices. The Credo, which is a mouthful, will normally hurry through the text with one note per syllable in all the voices. The effect is rather like blocks of sound than a leading voice with accompaniment (and in this time, the leading voice would be the tenor - but if the composer was good, he&apos;d make the other voices interesting, too). Hypothetically, a heterophonic rendition of a melody may turn out to be homophony - except that the heterophonic crowd would use lots of parallel fifths and octaves, or strings of sixths and thirds that go on too long to make it regular counterpoint (but good enough for William Billings and big band section writing).</p><p>Most music you are likely to hear falls outside the four -phonies. The   term for that one isn&apos;t quite as newfangled as &quot;heterophony&quot;, it&apos;s 300 years older and came into being when Monteverdi invented the opera. It&apos;s &quot;monody&quot;: one melody, and the rest is accompaniment. You may still find that an accompaniment in pound notes is homophonic, or you may describe arpeggiated chords against the melody as a kind of formulaic polyphony, but that&apos;s really beside the point for this kind of music.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>justinasia &#x3C;justinasia@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2007 4:04:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just posted a sample of the kind of music I was wondering about,<br/>what it would be classified as.
