The question of &quot;influence&apos; has always seemed to me miss the point.<br/>I think that many of the great artists were &quot;visionaries&quot; in that they saw exactly what direction music was going to go.<br/>Ives is a good example of this and if he had lived in europe they would state he &apos;influenced&apos; everyone else. It shows how<br/>troublesome this idea is, if not aebitrary. So i think it has always happen, others come to the same place without real<br/>knowledge of others. We tend to think (reduce) music to a craft when it an art. There is allot of well crafted crap as well<br/>as some great art not so well crafted.<br/>    Some people have suggested an influence of La Monte music upon myself for instance, which is quite humourous in that i<br/>hadn&apos;t heard any of his music till the mid 90&apos;s. I had already been doing just intonation for 20 years by this time. I did<br/>know he did pieces on single chords, but assumed he was playing with inversions. But i think La Monte might be considered a<br/>visionary in just the way i illustrated above. he saw where things were going to go. Artist can and do predict which<br/>direction music has and will go.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: kraig grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Re: noisy &quot;irrational tunings/scales&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I remember all to well the music still to be written<br/>&gt;                                                 -Neal Casava in &apos;War and Pieces&apos; 1989<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    From: Kurt Bigler &lt;<a href="mailto:kkb@breathsense.com">kkb@breathsense.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Re: noisy &quot;irrational tunings/scales&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; on 8/25/03 11:21 AM, Justin Weaver &lt;<a href="mailto:improvist@usa.net">improvist@usa.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here here!
