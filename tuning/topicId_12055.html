I have never tried to use it in the way that you<br/>describe, but I know that it does in fact have a some of the Wendy<br/>Carlos scales in there as presets.</p><p>The primary thing that I&apos;ve used it for is to bring vocal parts into<br/>tune - to simple JI, before I blend them together for the final<br/>mixdown. It is really amazing how well it work with vocals. One<br/>interesting thing is that it can be configured to ignore a gliss in a<br/>sound and only tune the sustained notes - this makes vocal chords<br/>sound very much in tune. It is not uncommon for me to overdubb up to<br/>a dozen separate vocal parts together in a harmony.</p><p>Another of the most important things I&apos;ve found I can do with this is<br/>to make a very long sample of the lowest note that a given woodwind<br/>can play, then use this plugin to iron out the pitch to make it<br/>perfectly in tune as the note evolves over time. I use these kinds of<br/>samples in my Akai S3000xl sampler, so that I don&apos;t have to loop the<br/>sample. This gives much greater realism - much more than my &quot;sample<br/>playback&quot; modules (like my Roland Sound Canvas). You can hear an<br/>example of this on my piece on the Tuning Punks Page on <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a><br/>called &quot;The 4th Order&quot;. The flute there was tuned with Autotune.</p><p>My feeling is that it&apos;ll really make you work hard to get good<br/>results with what you are wanting to do with it.</p><p>Good Day!</p><p>Jacky</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Gary Morrison &lt;MR88CET@T...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I just sent this to <a href="http://rec.audio.pro">rec.audio.pro</a>, and then (duh!) realized that<br/>I&apos;d probably<br/>&gt; get better luck on the tuning list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have any of you used Antares&apos; Autotune to retune to microtonal<br/>tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if it can be made to tune to a nonoctave tuning, that<br/>is one that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have any two pitches one or more octaves apart, like W.<br/>Carlos&apos; Alpha,<br/>&gt; Beta, and Gamma tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A friend who has explored Autotune a little, but not enough to know<br/>the answer<br/>&gt; for sure, says that you can establish a table of up to 60 pitches,<br/>but he isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; sure if those are required to repeat within an octave or what.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I can establish a table of 60 pitches that (by necessity) repeat<br/>every, 4, 5,<br/>&gt; or more octaves, rather than being required to duplicate that<br/>pattern every 1<br/>&gt; octave, that would probably be OK.

Carlos&apos; Alpha,<br/>&gt; Beta, and Gamma tunings.</p><p>I use it at work (as an audio engineer) when I have to.  I hate messing with a musician&apos;s<br/>intonation unless it&apos;s obviously necessary.  That said, it&apos;s completely flexible within the 60<br/>pitch limit.  In fact, it has the Partch Diamond, Carlos&apos; tunings, and many other famous<br/>microtunings as  factory presets.  It does microtones as well as it does 12t-ET.  When I tune<br/>background and harmony vocals with it, I usually set it to a JI tuning (diatonic, generally).</p><p>As Jacky pointed out, the primary limitation of it, which is likely to be a limitation of any<br/>real-time pitch altering software in the near future, is that it only works on monophonic<br/>tracks.  (Of course, you could use it on polyphonic tracks, but not with predictable results!)<br/>And as with any pitch processor, the less distance it has to move a pitch, the more natural the<br/>output is going to sound.  Technically, you could take a 12t-ET performance of any solo line<br/>and force it to any other tuning, even a non-repeating one.  But you&apos;d do much better to<br/>perform each track as near the intended tuning as possible to start with, then use Autotune to<br/>correct things by a few cents here and there, where necessary to avoid sounding &quot;out.&quot;</p><p>Jacky Ligon wrote:<br/>&gt; to make a very long sample of the lowest note that a given woodwind<br/>&gt; can play, then use this plugin to iron out the pitch to make it<br/>&gt; perfectly in tune as the note evolves over time.</p><p>Jacky, that&apos;s ingenious!  Thanks for the tip.</p><p>The very best thing about Autotune, beyond a doubt, is that you can use it to make anyone sound<br/>like Cher or Kid Rock!  PHTHphthphth....</p><p>--<br/>David J.
