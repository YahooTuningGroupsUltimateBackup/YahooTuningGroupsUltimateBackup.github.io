At<br/>the outset, I might express the view that Pythagorean tuning, also<br/>known as 3-limit just intonation, is an attractive solution, but that<br/>other solutions (including the &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; option of major thirds<br/>and sixths a Pythagorean comma wider than the usual 81:64 and 27:16,<br/>or ~9:7 and ~12:7) may have appeal in some settings.</p><p>In presenting my own approach as a medievalist to this cadence, I<br/>wouldn&apos;t want to imply that all other approaches should be excluded:<br/>someone oriented mainly to the dominant-tonic progressions of the late<br/>17th-19th centuries, or Schoenberg&apos;s pantonal patterns of the 20th<br/>century, might present a different analysis.</p><p>Also, some of the material in this article may tie in with<br/>presentations available on the Web concerning related subjects:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/landini.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/landini.html</a></p><p>---------------------<br/>1. A quick definition<br/>---------------------</p><p>For those who would like a quick definition, a Landini cadence in its<br/>most typical form is a variant on a favorite 14th-century cadence<br/>combining two favorite resolutions of the period by contrary motion:<br/>major third to fifth (M3-5) and major sixth to octave (M6-8). Let&apos;s<br/>look first at this basic cadence, without the &quot;Landini&quot; ornament; here<br/>C4 is middle C, and higher numbers show higher octaves. Incidentally,<br/>knowing how easy it is to type the wrong octave numbers, I should add<br/>that none of the cadences in this article should involve odd octave<br/>leaps; so if you see them, substitute the correct octave number which<br/>avoids such a result:</p><p>   E4  F4             D4  E4<br/>   B3  C4             A3  B3<br/>   G3  F3             F3  E3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5)   or  (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>Note that in the first example the upper voices each ascend by a<br/>semitone while the lowest voice descends by a whole-tone; in the<br/>second example, the lowest voice descends by a semitone and the upper<br/>voices ascend by a whole tone. In either version, the outer pair of<br/>voices expand M6-8 while the lower pair expand M3-5. If necessary,<br/>14th-century musicians routinely add accidentals (sometimes written<br/>out, sometimes inferred) to obtain major thirds and sixths for these<br/>resolutions to the fifth and octave respectively.</p><p>For example, for a cadence on D, either of these solutions might<br/>occur:</p><p>    C#4 D4       C4  D4<br/>    G#3 A3       G3  A3<br/>    E3  D3       Eb3 D3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5)  (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>Either choice gives us a major third before the fifth and a major<br/>sixth before the octave.</p><p>The distinctive &quot;Landini&quot; figure, in its most typical use, has the<br/>highest voice momentarily descend from the major sixth to the fifth<br/>before the expected resolution to the octave. Let&apos;s look at Landini<br/>forms for the above four examples:</p><p>E4 D4 F4     D4 C4 E4     C#4 B3 D4    C4 Bb3 D4<br/>B3    C4     A3    B3     G#3    A3    G3     A3<br/>G3    F3     F3    E3     E3     D3    Eb3    D3</p><p>Now that we&apos;ve defined a Landini cadence in its most usual<br/>14th-century form, let&apos;s consider the musical context.</p><p>----------------------<br/>2. Trinic progressions<br/>----------------------</p><p>First of all, we might focus on the ideal goal of 13th-14th century<br/>cadences for three or more voices: the complete trine (_trina harmoniae<br/>perfectio_ in Latin, or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony&quot;) consisting<br/>of an outer octave, lower fifth, and upper fourth. This sonority<br/>includes all three of the simple nonunisonal stable intervals: the 2:1<br/>octave, the 3:2 fifth, and the 4:3 fourth.</p><p>For example, F3-C4-F4 and A4-E4-A4 are complete trines. Such<br/>sonorities represent the medieval ideal of what I might call<br/>&quot;saturated stability&quot;: they are the richest and fullest stable<br/>sonorities possible, and thus ideal resolutions for unstable<br/>combinations.</p><p>In terms of string-ratios, the usual medieval way of describing<br/>intervals, the complete trine would be 6:4:3, with higher numbers<br/>showing longer strings and thus lower notes. We have a 2:1 octave<br/>between the outer strings, a 6:4 (or 3:2) fifth between the lower<br/>strings, and a 4:3 fourth between the upper strings.</p><p>If we apply later frequency-ratios, we get a complete trine of 2:3:4.<br/>A just intonation (JI) advocate might note that this sonority, like<br/>the later complete triad of 4:5:6, involves three adjacent partials,<br/>with the lowest of these partials an octave of the fundamental.</p><p>At any rate, taking the complete trine as our ideal cadential goal, we<br/>find that the most popular 13th-14th century cadences typically<br/>involve moving from an unstable sonority to a stable trine (or next<br/>most preferably its most choice interval of the fifth) with stepwise<br/>or sometimes thirdwise motion in all parts.</p><p>In these directed cadences, unstable intervals (seconds, thirds,<br/>sixths, and sevenths) ideally resolve to stable ones by conjunct or<br/>near-conjunct contrary motion. That is, either both voices move by<br/>step, or voice moves by step and the other by a third.</p><p>In the 13th century, a great variety of progressions fitting this<br/>basic pattern may be heard and relished, with the following a quick<br/>sample. In each case, I show the directed two-voice progressions in<br/>parenthesis below an example:</p><p>                                      F4  G4<br/>   C4 D4           E4 F4              E4  D4                D4  C4<br/>   A3 G3           B3 C4              C4  D4                G3  F3<br/>   F3 G3           A3 F4              A3  G3                E3  F3</p><p>(M3-1 + m3-5)      (M2-5)   (m6-8 + m3-5 + M3-1 + m2-4)  (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>In this style one might say that two-voice intervals are the<br/>elementary units of motion, and that these units can be combined to<br/>form various &quot;compounds&quot; -- a metaphor which Howard Hanson uses for<br/>some varieties of 20th-century harmony.</p><p>More generally, one might say that these cadences may express a<br/>broader theme in at least Western European traditions of verticality:<br/>the theme of tension-relaxation. An unstable sonority moves<br/>satisfyingly to a richly stable one.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>3. &quot;Closest approach&quot; and the 14th century<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>In the early 14th century, another artistic element comes into play:<br/>the ideal of &quot;closest approach.&quot; This ideal specifically favors<br/>elementary two-voice resolutions in which one voice moves by a<br/>whole-tone and the other ascends or descends by a semitone. While<br/>progressions of this kind are also very common in the 13th century,<br/>so are progressions where both voices move by a whole-tone.</p><p>Let&apos;s consider the progressions 3-1, 3-5, 6-8, and 7-5 to see how<br/>the &quot;closest approach&quot; ideal leads specifically to a preference for<br/>m3-1, M3-5, M6-8, and m7-5:</p><p>-------------------------       ------------------------<br/>     3-1 progressions               3-5 progressions</p><p>E3 D3    G3 F3    F3 E3         G3 A3     B3 C4    A3 B3<br/>C3 D3    E3 F3    D3 E3         E3 D3     G3 F3    F3 E3</p><p>M3-1     m3-1     m3-1          m3-5      M3-5     M3-5</p><p>-------------------------       ------------------------<br/>     6-8 progressions               7-5 progressions</p><p>C4 D4    E4 F4    D4 E4         E4 D4     D4 C4    C4 B3<br/>E3 D3    G3 F3    F3 E3         F3 G3     E3 F3    D3 E3</p><p>m6-8     M6-8     M6-8          M7-5      m7-5     m7-5</p><p>In each group of progressions, the first cadence is common in<br/>13th-century practice but does _not_ follow the 14th-century ideal of<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; because both voices move by whole-step. The<br/>remaining cadences in each group do follow this ideal, with one the<br/>voices moving by a semitone, which may be either ascending (second<br/>example in each group) or descending (third example).</p><p>As mentioned above, 14th-century musicians typically use accidentals<br/>in order to achieve &quot;closest approach&quot; progressions where they would<br/>not occur naturally. The most commonly used accidentals for this<br/>purpose are the five likely available on many 12-note Pythagorean<br/>keyboards of the era: Eb, Bb, F#, C#, and G#. However, some cadences<br/>naturally featuring (m6-8 + m3-5) might be left uninflection, and<br/>composers sometimes deliberately specify such progressions, e.g.</p><p>                Bb3 C4<br/>                F3  G3<br/>                D3  C3</p><p>            (m6-8 + m3-5)</p><p>This consideration of trinic progressions and the 14th-century norm --<br/>although not invariable rule -- of closest approach may put the<br/>Landini cadence in some perspective.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>4. The Landini cadence and its variants<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>From one viewpoint, a Landini cadence might be seen as combining some<br/>of the features of two popular cadences in the 13th century. The first<br/>of these cadences, which we have already encounters, involves a union<br/>of the 6-8 and 3-5 resolutions by contrary motion; in certain late<br/>13th-century compositions, manuscript accidentals suggest some<br/>tendency to prefer the M6-8 and M3-5 forms regularly favored in the<br/>14th century. Four examples:</p><p>   E3  F4         F#4 G4         D4  E3         G4  A4<br/>   B3  C4         C#4 D4         A3  B3         D4  E4<br/>   G3  F3         A3  G3         F3  E3         Bb3 A3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5)  (M6-8 + M3-5)  (M6-8 + M3-5)  (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>In another common 13th-century cadence, the lower voices also have a<br/>3-5 resolution, but the outer voices move from fifth to octave. In the<br/>cadence, the first unstable sonority is what Jacobus of Liege calls a<br/>_quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot;: an outer fifth &quot;split&quot; by the middle<br/>voice into the mildest unstable intervals of a major third below and a<br/>minor third above, or vice versa. Here are some examples with the M3-5<br/>progression increasingly preferred around 1300:</p><p>  D4  F4     E3   G4    C4  E4    F4   A4<br/>  B3  C4     C#3  D4    A3  B3    D4   E4<br/>  G3  F3     A3   G3    F3  E3    Bb3  A3</p><p>  (M3-5)     (M3-5)     (M3-5)    (M3-5)</p><p>From the viewpoint of &quot;efficiency,&quot; one might argue that this is not<br/>quite as ideal a progression as (M6-8 + M3-5). Both progressions<br/>arrive at a complete trine, but here the upper voice leaps by a third,<br/>rather than all voices moving by stepwise motion. Also, while the<br/>unstable third between the lower two voices resolves by ideally<br/>efficient stepwise contrary motion (M3-5), the third between the upper<br/>pair of voices resolves by less ideal similar motion (m3-4).</p><p>However, the thirdwise motion in the highest voice gives this cadence<br/>its own flavor which can be quite &quot;lyrical&quot; (at least to me).</p><p>The Landini cadence might be said to combine both these forms by<br/>having a sixth in the upper voice descend momentarily to the fifth<br/>before this interval expands to the octave:</p><p>E4 D4 F4     F#4 E4 G4     D4 C4 E4     G4 F4 A4<br/>B3    C4     C#4    D4     A3    B4     D4    E4<br/>G3    F3     A3     G3     F3    E3     Bb3   A3</p><p>Many variants can and do occur: while such cadences may sometimes be<br/>found in the 13th century, they become very popular in the 14th<br/>century, with Landini certainly being one the most famous composers to<br/>enjoy this figure.</p><p>While I have given three-voice examples, three parts being the norm in<br/>13th-14th century writing, the Landini idiom is also very common in<br/>two-voice compositions of the 14th century. To see typical two-voice<br/>Landini cadences, we need only look at the outer pair of voices in the<br/>last example, disregarding the middle part.</p><p>While the Landini figure is most often applied to the 6-8 resolution,<br/>it may also be applied to the 3-5 resolution, as in an idiom popular<br/>during the early 15th century in which both progressions are<br/>ornamented:</p><p>E4 D4 F4<br/>B3 A3 C4<br/>G3    F3</p><p>From an aesthetic viewpoint, given that the favorite 14th-century<br/>cadence uniting M6-8 and M3-5 represents the ideal of directed<br/>vertical action, the Landini figure might be described as a pleasant<br/>and lyrical prolongation of the inevitable. One early 14th-century<br/>treatise asserts that the major sixth &quot;seeks the octave, and without<br/>fail&quot;; by a diverting dalliance with the fifth before the anticipated<br/>expansion to the octave, this idiom adds melodic interest and<br/>decoration to one of the most beautiful cadences of all time.</p><p>In this presentation I have focused on basic musical patterns and<br/>ideals such as &quot;closest approach&quot; which may be relevant in considering<br/>issues of intonation -- the topic for the concluding portion of this<br/>article.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
