Even to those who<br/>disagreed with me.</p><p>It was nice to see that we can discuss the overarching problems of gaining<br/>wider acceptance of microtonality, and of the problems of tuning in general,<br/>rather than the usual drear about which blackjack mode or ratio pushes your<br/>buttons.</p><p>What we should be doing _IMHO_ is not living in the ghetto and whining and<br/>using DIY instruments (apologies, Harry) and freebie software, no matter how<br/>/good/ it may be.</p><p>What we should be discussing is how we can engage ordinary musicians in what<br/>we believe to be a valid means of musical expression.</p><p>Some don&apos;t like my methods (too many complain of the mathematical origins,<br/>and some complain that it&apos;s tonality all over again, and we&apos;ve had plenty<br/>enough of that) but so far, I&apos;ve been having successes here and there. For<br/>example, via my partner, a recorder player is now asking how she can obtain<br/>a 19-tone recorder: she belongs to a large amateur community specialising in<br/>music involving recorders (inc Mediaeval instruments). From one, to another,<br/>and another...</p><p>But 19 is just another scale amongst many, many possibilities.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2003 2:10:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; What we should be doing _IMHO_ is not living in the ghetto and whining and<br/>&gt; using DIY instruments (apologies, Harry) and freebie software, no matter how<br/>&gt; /good/ it may be.</p><p>Why?

I am in complete agreement with you.  And Rachel Barnes from<br/>London plays a 19-tone equal tempered tenor recorder.  She has a piece by a<br/>talented composer for 2 players and pre-recorded music that she wants to play<br/>on the AFMM concerts next Spring.</p><p>I am beginning to wonder if there is a direct inverse proportion between<br/>microtonalists being afraid of live musicians, and conventional 12 listeners<br/>being afraid of microtones.</p><p>:)  Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/1/2003 6:34:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Alison,</p><p>I don&apos;t think Mark was trying to piss other Listers off.

Don&apos;t do it yourself, don&apos;t rely on current tools, hope for something in the future that may or may not appear (most likely due to a near-zero demand), and sit.</p><p>And sit. And sit. And sit.</p><p>(we pause for this moment to honor the value of the process of thoughtful insight, reflection, and discovery, that can and does take place while sitting...)</p><p>Everyone needs to be comfortable with their own path, and Carl has explained his path often enough, and with conviction, that neither I nor anyone else should attempt to convince him otherwise. But others, for reasons just as personally valid, don&apos;t want to sit and wait and opine and type and research. They want to do something _now_ with whatever means available, and when push comes to shove they are going to make the most inroads (IMO). If at some point, years from now, we are still in a world dominated by one tuning system, there will be those that waited for something to change, and there will be those that created something different along the way, even if it did not affect the final outcome.</p><p>Cherish, conserve, consider, create.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/1/2003 11:34:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You know, Alison, you could probably pick a single week that takes in 2<br/>concerts at very reasonable airline prices.
