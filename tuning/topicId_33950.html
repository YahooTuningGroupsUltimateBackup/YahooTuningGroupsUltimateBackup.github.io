I&apos;m emerging from the<br/>wings to ask a favor of the list, especially frequent<br/>contributors.</p><p>I&apos;m currently pursuing a musicology PhD at the Eastman<br/>School of Music, and plan on doing a dissertation on<br/>the life and music of La Monte Young. This has lead me<br/>into an unexpected realm of inquiry, that of the<br/>relationship between tuning systems (especially JI)<br/>and ideologies that their practitioners might<br/>consciously or unconsciously attach to them (or the<br/>ideologies/worldviews that such tunings emerge from).</p><p>As part of my research (which I will utilize in the<br/>next couple of days for an ethnomusicology seminar I&apos;m<br/>taking) I would like to do a brief ethnographical<br/>study in which I solicit information and opinions from<br/>various composers/theorists interested in alternate<br/>tuning systems. A secondary focus of the study will be<br/>an examination of the unique &quot;ethnographic&quot; issues<br/>encountered in studying a group of people scattered<br/>geographically, whose forum of communication about<br/>music is the internet.</p><p>I would be very grateful if some of the frequent<br/>contributors to the list would be willing to<br/>participate. I will ask willing parties to answer a<br/>short questionairre off-list via email (or some other<br/>mutually agreeable means). Because of the nature of my<br/>study, some of the questions will be of a rather<br/>personal nature (beliefs about the nature or power of<br/>music/tuning, one&apos;s general political orientations,<br/>one&apos;s ethnic/religious background and current<br/>religious/spiritual practices or beliefs), but I would<br/>guarantee each individual&apos;s anonimity and, if desired,<br/>would also be willing to use a forum in which a<br/>respondent&apos;s identity would be hidden from me<br/>personally.</p><p>While this will be an ongoing study, my immediate<br/>ethnographic study will need to be conducted within<br/>the next couple of days. If you would be willing to<br/>answer my questionairre (which I imagine will take<br/>about 15 minutes to fill out), please contact me<br/>offlist at <a href="mailto:jngrimshaw@yahoo.com">jngrimshaw@yahoo.com</a>.</p><p>Thanks in advance to everyone willing to participate.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>J.

As I<br/>mentioned, the main thrust of my research involves the relationships<br/>between ideologies/worldviews and tuning systems. However, I&apos;m also<br/>interested in the internet as a forum for musical communities.<br/>Consequently, some of the questions deal with respondents&apos; general<br/>music activities and their participation in the list, while others<br/>deal specifically with tuning as a possible reflection of worldview.</p><p>1) What general part of the world do you live in? (Be as specific or<br/>vague as you like.)</p><p>2a) How long have you subscribed to the list?</p><p>2b) How frequently do you contribute to the list?</p><p>3a) How much time per day/week do you spend reading or posting to the<br/>list?</p><p>3b) Do you use the internet in other ways to communicate or<br/>distribute your compositions or ideas about music? (Include URLS of<br/>web pages if you wish.)</p><p>4) Are musical activities your main source of income, or do you have<br/>some other &quot;day job&quot;?</p><p>5) What kinds of tunings interest you most (JI, alternate TETs,<br/>particular non-Western tunings, etc.)?</p><p>6) Do you compose music using alternate tunings? Are you more of a<br/>theorist? Hobbyist? Interested observer?</p><p>7) How long have you been interested in alternate tuning systems?<br/>What initially attracted you to them?</p><p>8) Do you come from a particular religious background or spiritual<br/>heritage? If so, which?</p><p>9) Do you currently practice or subscribe to a particular religious<br/>or spiritual tradition? If so, which, and what initially attracted<br/>you to it?</p><p>10) Do you recognize any connections or parallels between your<br/>religious/spiritual views and your musical interests or practices?</p><p>11) Do you attribute to music any particular &quot;transcendent&quot; powers?<br/>That is, do you feel that music has an inherent spiritual component?</p><p>12) If so, do you feel that particular tuning systems enhance or<br/>augment music&apos;s spiritual or transcendent potential? Do you feel that<br/>the equal temperament system is fundamentally less able to articulate<br/>or convey spiritual content or ideas that other kinds of tuning?</p><p>13) If you do attribute particular spiritual potential to certain<br/>tuning systems, does that potential rely on mathematical parameters<br/>of a tuning system? How accurately must those mathematical properties<br/>be articulated in practical terms for a given tuning system to<br/>maintain its spiritual potential? (To put it simply, how closely must<br/>the acoustical reality of a tuning system as it is manifested in<br/>performance replicate the theoretical apparatus upon which it is<br/>based?)</p></div><h3><a id=33979 href="#33979">ðŸ”—</a>M.
