Just because the historians suggested it? (If so,<br/>&gt; okay; if not, why?) God knows, the natural ear does not operate on meantone.<br/>&gt; It may be that there is more to the story than &quot;history.&quot; What if human<br/>&gt; perception operates on principles not yet known? How exciting to be &quot;in the<br/>&gt; hunt.&quot;</p><p>All musicians in France *learn* straight from the beginning the Pythagorean<br/>cercle of fifths. Only the term Pythagorean doesn&apos;t occure until much later<br/>and the fifths are already tempered, so the cercle closes after twelve<br/>fifths. Some of them learn that the Pythagorean whole tone (9/8), as a<br/>result of this circle, can be split up into 9 commas, five of which to make<br/>a sharp upwards and five of which to make a flat downwards. So they logicall<br/>conclude that C# is higher than Db. Other musicians just take it for<br/>granted. Calculations disturb them, and they simply say: &quot;Sharps high, flats<br/>low&quot;. That&apos;s a princip, isn&apos;t it? So, if they want a low C# they play it &quot;as<br/>a Db&quot;. It&apos;s a communication convention, which I thought was noteworthy and<br/>rather funny. For me it prooved that there is still no universal intonation<br/>system to which categorically all music is obedient.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Emmanuel Krivine,<br/>&gt;&gt; conductor of the Orchestre National de Lyon spotted a C# in the flute part,<br/>&gt;&gt; which apparently sounded too high (C#s on flutes *are* already higher than<br/>&gt;&gt; usual).

Too bad you didn&apos;t have a tape recorder in your lap to capture the<br/>&gt; moment. That would bring the &quot;team&quot; to life, for sure.</p><p>I wish I had!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I have &quot;known&quot; all my early and professional life that raised pitches are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; normally tuned higher than lowered pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wim:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s the result of the Pythagorean approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not really. I never heard of Pythogoras during the early time that my<br/>&gt; musical ear was developing (and I&apos;m not crazy about the notion of<br/>&gt; piled-up-fifths influencing perception). No &quot;approach&quot; was suggested by<br/>&gt; anyone. I simply<br/>&gt; listened to the way pitches seemed to fit together. As a young group singer<br/>&gt; (choral and barbershop), I simply followed my aural instincts.</p><p>Rules and laws follow nature. Do we have to learn about Newton before<br/>dropping something on the floor?
