If we&apos;re going to go that<br/>route, then another option that isn&apos;t as bad as it looks is 21-equal,<br/>as an equal-tempered version of blackjack, meaning that it might just<br/>destroy all other competitors in terms of being a coarse grid for the<br/>11-limit. (For the record, I firmly believe that miracle is going to<br/>become one of the Best Temperaments Ever, once we work out the<br/>MODMOS&apos;s and figure out the generalities of chromatic harmony in it).</p><p>A last thing to think about - most existing musicians actually don&apos;t<br/>find it very easy to think in cents at all, so there&apos;s plenty of time<br/>to indoctrinate them. Yes, they get the idea (once you tell them) that<br/>a cent is 1/100th of a semitone, but quiz the average musician on what<br/>interval class 900 cents is and they&apos;ll have to think a second for<br/>sure. Instead, people tend to think more diatonically, with there<br/>being &quot;fourths&quot; and &quot;thirds&quot; and all that, so it might very well,<br/>paradoxically, become more intuitive for the coarse grid to correspond<br/>to something like 7-equal, and just have people make more use of the<br/>fine grid. If this actually did turn out to be more intuitive, then<br/>that would actually be a good reason to use millicents, as 10-EDO is<br/>both miracle and pajara in one.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100042 href="#100042">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2011 1:24:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wolfpeuker&quot; &lt;wolfpeuker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Alternate Tuning list,<br/>&gt; at last I&apos;ve managed to join this group :) A big hello in the round!</p><p>Hi!
