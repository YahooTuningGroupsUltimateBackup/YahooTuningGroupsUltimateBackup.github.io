For example, it seems that the melody<br/>(usually sung by the second-highest and loudest voice) tends to be in<br/>Pythagorean while the harmonies are often just (up to 9-limit) relative to<br/>that. So you&apos;d need a way to be able to play each note of the Pythagorean<br/>scale as the root, third, fifth, seventh, or ninth of a 4:5:6:7:9 dominant<br/>ninth chord in order to cover a good chunk of what Barbershop does -- right<br/>off the bat, I&apos;m not seeing a simple solution with a relatively small number<br/>of frets.</p></div>
