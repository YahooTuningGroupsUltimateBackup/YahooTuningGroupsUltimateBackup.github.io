However, while reading this current exchange, it seemed to me<br/>that there might be some value in viewing the augmented-sixth chord in a<br/>somewhat fresh and more practical (I think) light.</p><p>Paul Erlich:</p><p>&gt;&gt; The Bb7 and Eb7 that Ken refers to are not really dominant<br/>&gt;&gt; seventh chords; since his tuning includes C# and G# but not<br/>&gt;&gt; Db or Ab, these are actually augmented sixth chords. They<br/>&gt;&gt; are &quot;septimal&quot; since, as Ken points out, they very closely<br/>&gt;&gt; approximate 4:5:6:7.</p><p>Nowhere in traditional common practice does &quot;spelling&quot; count more than in<br/>the augmented sixth chord. The difference between Ab-C-Eb-Gb on one hand and<br/>Ab-C-D#-F# is critical to aural perception of the &quot;musical action&quot; in that<br/>the C-Gb tritone is significantly smaller (5:7) than the C-F# tritone<br/>(7:10). (35:49 vs. 35:50)</p><p>It is very easy to hear the difference when a well tuned dominant seventh<br/>chord and it enharmonic &quot;equivalent&quot; augmented sixth chord are heard in<br/>isolation (without context). When the augmented sixth chord is tuned<br/>properly, one can anticipate its direction even before the resolution chord<br/>is heard.</p><p>I guess what I&apos;m saying here is that if a meantone augmented sixth chord<br/>sounds very much like 4:5:6:7, it will not likely be very convincing in<br/>terms of harmonic &quot;direction&quot; and musical expressiveness.</p><p>Joe Monzo contributes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul is very careful in his last response here to put<br/>&gt; quotation marks around &apos;septimal&apos; (they did not appear<br/>&gt; in his original description) and to note that this meantone<br/>&gt; chord *approximates* 4:5:6:7.  I&apos;m glad that he added those<br/>&gt; two things, and I think that there&apos;s a very important point<br/>&gt; hidden in here that deserves further elaboration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First off, the &apos;augmented 6th&apos; under consideration actually<br/>&gt; has a more specific name in regular music-theory, actually two,<br/>&gt; which appear in 4-part harmony as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - &apos;Italian 6th&apos;, which is a IV 6+<br/>&gt; i.e., first inversion of the subdominant chord where<br/>&gt; the &apos;3rd&apos;, which is in the bass, is flattened by a 1/2-step,<br/>&gt; the &apos;root&apos; (in an upper voice) is sharpened by a 1/2-step,<br/>&gt; and the &apos;5th&apos; is doubled.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - &apos;German 6th&apos;, which is a IV 6+ 5 3<br/>&gt; i.e., the same as above except that instead of doubling<br/>&gt; the &apos;5th&apos;, one voice has the &apos;5th&apos; and the other the &apos;7th&apos;<br/>&gt; flattened by a 1/2-step.</p><p>Interestingly, Kostka &amp; Payne, in their theory textbook &quot;Tonal Harmony,&quot;<br/>actually drop the use of &quot;phony&quot; Roman numeral roots in favor of simply<br/>using the names &quot;Italian,&quot; German&quot; and &quot;French.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 12-EDO, both of these have the same interval structure<br/>&gt; as the &apos;dominant 7th&apos;; the &apos;Italian 6th&apos; lacks what would<br/>&gt; be the &apos;5th&apos; in the &apos;dominant 7th&apos; chord, and the &apos;German 6th&apos;<br/>&gt; contains it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point of this is that I think we should be careful<br/>&gt; to refer to the distinction between the two in tuning<br/>&gt; theory when it is relevant to the structure of the chords,<br/>&gt; altho I suppose &apos;augmented 6th&apos; is good enough in most cases.</p><p>Yes, I agree. I think common practice usage is seen more clearly when the<br/>three &quot;constant&quot; members (b6, 1 and #4) are viewed as a secondary dominant<br/>(V7 of V) with a lowered fifth. The difference between &quot;Italian,&quot; &quot;German&quot;<br/>and &quot;French&quot; then is simply a matter of the placement of the &quot;remaining&quot;<br/>member. The Roman numerals simply get in the way and confuse the function.</p><p>This usage is even clearer when the augmented sixth chord is used in a<br/>simple dominant function (Db-F-G-B or Db-F-Ab-B including the resulting<br/>parallel fifths) directly to tonic resolution (C-E-G-C).</p><p>Monz continues:</p><p>&gt; Note that there are also two other &apos;augmented 6th&apos; chords:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - the &apos;French 6th&apos;, which is II 6+ 4 3<br/>&gt; i.e., the same as the &apos;German&apos; exceptthat the &apos;flat (or minor)<br/>&gt; 7th&apos; is lowered a further 1/2-step to a &apos;6th&apos;, which would be<br/>&gt; a &apos;flat 5th&apos; in the &apos;dominant 7th&apos; interpretation.</p><p>Or more functionally, the &quot;remaining&quot; pitch in question serves as a<br/>functional root (D) in the V7 of V analysis I mentioned above (Ab-C-D-F# as<br/>opposed to a rather irrational Ab-C-Ebb-F#). (F# should be the LAST of the<br/>four pitches one would consider to be a root in any functional sense.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - one without a specific name, which is +II 6+ 4++ 3<br/>&gt; i.e., the same as the &apos;German&apos;, but spelled as a sharpened<br/>&gt; &apos;6th&apos; rather than a flattened &apos;7th&apos;.</p><p>Spelled Ab-C-D#-F# implying a resolution to the unstable G-C-E-G (tonic<br/>six-four) on the way to the more stable destination G-B-D-G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (see _The New Harvard Dictionary of Music_, p 752)</p><p>Also see Kostka &amp; Payne, pp. 384-391.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
