Try these two out. The &quot;major&quot; C B<br/>&gt; A K J here is an utonal 1/(25:22:20:17:15) pentad, and the &quot;minor&quot; C B<br/>&gt; Ab K J is the otonal pentad:</p><p>Well, OK, so this was TOTALLY inept:</p><p>I checked my notes from last night, and I actually was playing the SAME<br/>pentads last night as I did tonight.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t playing TETRADS at all!</p><p>Last night, however, the &quot;minor&quot; seemed MUCH more &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot;<br/>as the major, but since you kept insisting that they were both the same,<br/>when I listened TONIGHT, I heard them both as the same...</p><p>Actually, there is something quite valuable learned, at least to me, in<br/>this experiment... it is the power of PSYCHOLOGY and expecting to hear a<br/>certain thing!</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t it be interesting to try different experiments of this<br/>nature... and how different expectations influenced the end result???</p><p>I swear I really heard something totally different tonight.  Of course,<br/>there is another factor... perhaps memory, and the familiarity with<br/>these chords.  Maybe there is even a &quot;disassociation&quot; with 12t-ET memory<br/>that was going on in the back of my brain during the interim.  In other<br/>words, the &quot;minor&quot; chord originally sounded like something more stable<br/>in 12t-ET and I made that association, but after processing this<br/>information as something DISTINCT from prior experiences, I was able to<br/>hear the chords &quot;fresh&quot; and different again after a suitable interval --<br/>and they seemed more ALIKE!</p><p>This process, of course, happens frequently in composition, as everybody<br/>knows.  One thinks one has something, and then coming back to it again<br/>in another day or night, one finds out it is entirely something else...<br/>or at least it is PERCEIVED as something else.  In a way, that&apos;s why<br/>it&apos;s good to have break intervals while writing a piece... so this<br/>element of &quot;perspective&quot; or mental processing is allowed to take place<br/>as a piece is progressing...</p><p>Well, yes it was totally stupid, but I learned something even more<br/>valuable in this process!</p><p>___________ ____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
