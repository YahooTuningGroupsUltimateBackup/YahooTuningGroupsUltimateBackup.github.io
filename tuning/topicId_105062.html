Special thinks to Chris<br/>Vaisvil for the idea of &quot;degrees of freedom,&quot; exactly what we need,<br/>and the basis for the title of my article:</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/tn101812-3degrees.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/tn101812-3degrees.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Basically, if a &quot;Rank-3&quot; temperament means one with the three<br/>parameters I&apos;m about to describe, it&apos;s something a newbie or oldster<br/>can understand without a lot of math. Let&apos;s try it!</p><p>Our temperament involves three &quot;degrees of freedom,&quot; which I&apos;ll<br/>describe in the simplest and most familiar terms I can. We need an<br/>octave, which we&apos;ll set at 2/1; we need a fifth or fourth, which we&apos;ll<br/>set at 704 cents or 496 cents. That&apos;s two of the three degrees of<br/>freedom, and enough for us to tune a chain of fifths and fourths and<br/>create a tuning, with 12 or 17 notes as a good size. Let&apos;s pick 12, in<br/>order to keep things familiar.</p><p>Now comes our third degree of freedom: we&apos;re going to generate a<br/>second 12-note chain just like the first, and place it at a _spacing_<br/>that gives us some new types of intervals that we like.</p><p>So we have a choice of octave (here 2/1 or 1200 cents); generator<br/>(here the 704-cent fifth or 496-cent fourth); and spacing between the<br/>two chains we create using that octave and generator.</p><p>Very quickly, let&apos;s say we notice that we have regular major seconds<br/>at 208 cents -- ten of them. We&apos;d like a 7/6 third (267 cents), or<br/>something close. That suggests a spacing of about 59 cents, to get us<br/>ten pure 7/6 thirds.</p><p>We&apos;d also like a 13/8 harmonic sixth, at 841 cents. We notice that we<br/>have eight minor sixths at 784 cents -- a difference of 57 cents, and<br/>another possible choice for our spacing, the third degree of freedom.</p><p>So we compromise and pick 58 cents, and tune that second chain. Now we<br/>have a full-fledged &quot;Rank-3&quot; temperament -- at least if the term has<br/>been intuitively defined &lt;grin&gt;: octave, 2/1 or 1200 cents; generator,<br/>704 or 496 cents; spacing, 58 cents.</p><p>At this point, we know that we have lots of our beloved 7/4 harmonic<br/>sevenths and 13/8 harmonic sixths within a cent or two of just; but<br/>what happens next? What other intervals do we get? How can we use all<br/>of this musically? To find out, just follow the link above.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter</p></div><h3><a id=105065 href="#105065">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2012 7:00:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you for this Margo - this article is very informing - I appreciate<br/>it!

And your deep knowledge of these tunings!</p><p>Dear Chris,</p><p>Thank you so warmly for your gracious words, for your idea about<br/>&quot;degrees of freedom&quot; that launched my article, and also for your<br/>understanding of how these tunings have been at the center of my<br/>musical life for much of the time since the year 2000. And George<br/>Secor was at it already in 1978, two decades before I started making<br/>music with xenharmonic tunings!</p><p>Your generous words and your insightful allusions to physics provide<br/>an opportunity, I hope, for a friendly dialogue on the relationship of<br/>the Regular Mapping Paradigm (RMP) to the traditional or classic<br/>methods many of us to discover and navigate tunings. This is an<br/>opportunity for mutual understanding and discovery!</p><p>In physics, the powerful and often astounding tools and discoveries of<br/>quantum mechanics haven&apos;t made classic Newtonian mechanics obsolete.<br/>Bus and train schedules, and even schedules for travel in orbit,<br/>generally rely on Newton&apos;s three familiar laws, and disregard the<br/>effects of Einstein&apos;s special relativity which we know, nevertheless,<br/>operate at walking or driving speeds as well as those near the speed<br/>of light.</p><p>In music, I recognize RMP as obviously an intriguing and powerful<br/>tool for creating new tunings, and also a way to get new perspectives<br/>on tunings designed using other approaches, whether centuries ago or<br/>in recent months and years by members of this list.</p><p>In fact, just yesterday I noted a 17-note tempered version I had made<br/>of Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s pipedum_17c.scl using a system called MET-24,<br/>rather like Peppermint but with a bit less tempering: 2/1 octave;<br/>fifths at 703.711 cents; and spacing between 12-note chains at 57.422<br/>cents.</p><p>The specific details aren&apos;t as important as the fact that I&apos;d love to<br/>get an RMP analysis of what commas I&apos;m tempering out, and how the<br/>accuracy would be rated using the same measures as for the tunings<br/>designed using RMP methodology.</p><p>Clearly that would be a learning experience for me. And in return, I&apos;d<br/>be delighted to share what I know through lots of experience about the<br/>region around 704 cents, and some of the landmarks of the region,<br/>which recent tuning list discussions have caused me to scrutinize more<br/>closely.</p><p>Of course, Chris, my invitation is meant for you and anyone else who<br/>might be interested. Also, I&apos;d be glad to help whoever is doing the<br/>Wiki pages on 2-3-7-11-13 tunings update these pages to cover Geroge<br/>Secor&apos;s 29-HTT of 1978 (which has a subset I feel absolutely deserves<br/>recognition, like his Miracle tuning in a different area, as a<br/>germinal landmark), Peppermint, O3, and MET-24.</p><p>That would, of course, involve not only my summarizing the data on<br/>these tunings (with George Secor the best authority on HTT, of<br/>course!), but someone involved with RMP figuring out the commas and<br/>parameters and data for a listing. And in the process, I would get the<br/>chance to learn more both about these tuning systems and RMP itself.</p><p>&gt;  Best wishes,<br/>&gt;  Chris</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
