Thankyou for your encouragement but I think that I will<br/>plough a lone furrow in a lone field. I don&apos;t want my postings to<br/>become lost amongst 76000+ messages. I am seriously interested in<br/>making microtonality more easy for the youger generations--not more<br/>difficult. Thankyou again. It&apos;s been a lot of fun while it lasted.</p></div>
