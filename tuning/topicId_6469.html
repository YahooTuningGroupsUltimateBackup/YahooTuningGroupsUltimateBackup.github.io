I had read only musicology-like essays on this topic.</p><p>&gt;&gt;2. The second book is much less forgiving than the first as far a staying<br/>&gt;&gt;within the consonant areas of one 12-tone meantone key.  And what was Bach<br/>&gt;&gt;to do at the organ -- his organ book is the most chromatic of all his<br/>&gt;&gt;output.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It sounds like you&apos;re not agreeing with Hafner at all. Why are you inclined<br/>&gt;to accept his thesis, then?</p><p>The above quote refers more to the meantone aspect of the Hafner article<br/>than the thesis.</p><p>Both the tuning wrench and graduated tension theories have pros and cons.<br/>I favor the former because I don&apos;t believe the consonance of the distant<br/>keys in irregular temperament would have been any point of attraction for<br/>Bach or his audience, and because of what I have read of Bach&apos;s habits with<br/>the tuning wrench...</p><p>&gt;&gt;Some points of interest here: 1. Was the composition then so tailored to<br/>&gt;&gt;the specific key of irregular temperament?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t believe it was tailored at all, let alone &quot;so tailored&quot;.</p><p>So you find the studies unconvincing?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.
