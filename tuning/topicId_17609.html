When I hear something I really like I<br/>&gt; record it, and then wait for a piece to evolve where I can use it.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>I&apos;ve just had a thought from this, to add option to periodically<br/>record all the relevant variables while the fractal tune is playing.</p><p>The algorithms aren&apos;t easy to run backwards, so there is no<br/>reverse button, but with the numbers recorded at regular intervals<br/>(up to some maximum buffer size, and using some specified time<br/>interval), one then add a reverse button that goes backwards one<br/>step at a time.</p><p>One is talking about, as a rough first estimate, perhaps something like 10 k for each one.<br/>(May turn out to be less, and may depend on which options are ticked for the fractal tune<br/>too)</p><p>So<br/>ten such points would be 100K. E.g. , 5 secs ago, 10, 15, 20, ... up to 50 secs.</p><p>Could record more by allocating a larger buffer for it.</p><p>I&apos;ll give it a try some day. Then if you find something you really like,<br/>you can go back to just before it started.</p><p>Also do it so that you can set a bookmark on any time in the fractal tune, and<br/>save the bookmarks to the .ts file, and then at any time, you can start it up<br/>again at the bookmark instead of playing through from the beginning.</p><p>So you can go back to the bookmark whenever you like, and try changing<br/>any of the parameters you want, add extra voices to the fractal tune, or<br/>whatever.</p><p>Glad you are finding FTS helpful, and thanks for your suggestions!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
