They are<br/>all &quot;there&quot; and the fingerings are easier to coral than the code for the<br/>human genome.  The fact that they are all there on the cello has hot meant<br/>that there is great microtonal cello music.  That is the duty of the composer<br/>and not the fault of the instrument.  Designing new instruments is perhaps a<br/>red herring.  But hey I liked Word Perfect.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
