I have<br/>stated here before my interest in transposable<br/>structures. I have stated in the past a &apos;rule&apos; which<br/>turned out to insufficient. Currently I&apos;m using a<br/>progressive subdivision algorithm, I&apos;ll just show<br/>in 12 (working in interval space).</p><p>                  12<br/>             7            5<br/>          5       2       5<br/>        3    2    2     3    2<br/>      2   1  2    2   2   1   2</p><p>This is a tree of transposable structures. What<br/>makes them transposable is that finding the<br/>characteristic interval and altering it at either<br/>endpoint such that it becomes the &apos;normal&apos;<br/>interval causes the scale to be rotated (i.e.<br/>turn into one of its modes).</p><p>Then David J. Finnamore stated :</p><p>&gt; Subject: Term for horagramic division<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In each ring of a horagram, the previous ring&apos;s large<br/>&gt; interval (L) is divided into a new L and s (small<br/>&gt; interval). As it does so, it also adopts the &quot;s&quot; from<br/>&gt; the previous ring as either it&apos;s &quot;s&quot; or it&apos;s new &quot;L.&quot;<br/>&gt; (See <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a> )  It seems to<br/>&gt; me that there&apos;s something &quot;proper&quot; about a ring&apos;s &quot;s&quot;<br/>&gt; becoming the next ring&apos;s &quot;L,&quot; as opposed to adjacent<br/>&gt; rings sharing an &quot;s&quot; size.  The term &quot;proper&quot; already<br/>&gt; has an important meaning in the world of scales so it<br/>&gt; probably should not be called something like &quot;proper<br/>&gt; subdivision.&quot;  For now, I&apos;m calling it &quot;sequential<br/>&gt; subdivision.&quot;  But that feels a little clumsy and<br/>&gt; vague.  Any suggestions?<br/>&gt;</p><p>...so obviously what I&apos;m doing is well understood. I<br/>have since stopped using an L and s nomenclature since<br/>whether<br/>             LsLss</p><p>turned into</p><p>       LssLsss    or   sLLsLLL</p><p>was not important to whether or not it was transposable.<br/>Guess I&apos;ll have to go to the Wilson archive but first...</p><p>So David, what are you looking for? (I noticed that<br/>the branches of Ls -&gt; Lss -&gt; Lsss -&gt; Lssss didin&apos;t<br/>seem to go anywhere interesting, but there seemsed to<br/>be interesting things where SOME steps do this)...</p><p>Paul and Dan, I&apos;ve been following<br/>your thread on decatonics. I found a 10-note<br/>transposable set which I would label...</p><p>              baa baa baaa</p><p>The characteristic interval is aaa (or baabaab).</p><p>In a subsequent post I&apos;ll probably go into all kinds<br/>of interesting points about this (and other) such<br/>systems but first...</p><p>1) Paul, why didn&apos;t you think that transposability<br/>   was of any relevence in your definition of<br/>   tonality? As far as I know, this is the only<br/>   transposable decatonic system, and it didn&apos;t<br/>   appear in your paper (I don&apos;t think) nor is<br/>   it representable in 22edo.</p><p>2) Is this orderring above, &quot;maximally even&quot;?</p><p>3) One tuning for this scale is</p><p>  b   a    a    a    b    a    a   b     a     a<br/>0  57  204  351  498  555  702  849  906  1053  1200</p><p>which was derived by making baabaa = 3:2. A pretty<br/>accurate renderring in 24tet would be 1333133133.</p><p>Is this tuning &quot;proper&quot;? I would say no becuase the<br/>largest third (333) is larger than the smallest<br/>fourth (1331). Is there a special word fo improper<br/>but unique?</p><p>4) Is this MOS? If I start on the 849 term and<br/>   continuously add 351 I fill out exactly this<br/>   scale at the time a third required stepsize<br/>   appears...</p><p>5) any questions I forgot?</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Paul H.

But I don&apos;t thing modulation is a prerequisite for tonality.</p><p>Anyway, my decatonic system has a form of transposability, only slightly<br/>more complex than &quot;transpoability&quot; as you&apos;ve defined it. This is evident<br/>from a table of decatonic key signatures. To see a correct version of that,<br/>you may order my paper _The Forms of Tonality_ from Bill Alves.</p><p>&gt;2) Is this orderring above, &quot;maximally even&quot;?</p><p>              baa baa baaa</p><p>might be maximally even depending on what b and a are. If b and a are 1 and<br/>2 or 2 and 1, yes. If b and a are 1 and 3 or 3 and 1, no. Maximal evenness<br/>is only defined with respect to the cardinality of the &quot;chromatic set&quot;.<br/>Another reason I don&apos;t like maximal evenness -- why should you have to<br/>postulate a chromatic set in a musical style which doesn&apos;t make use of one?</p><p>&gt;Is this tuning &quot;proper&quot;? I would say no becuase the<br/>&gt;largest third (333) is larger than the smallest<br/>&gt;fourth (1331).

The horagram rings are all the MOSs for a given generator; though<br/>Wilson&apos;s golden horagrams are constructed from noble generators, Kraig Grady<br/>has used rhythmic horagram structures which show that the concept is<br/>applicable to equal divisions as well.</p></div><h3>David J.

Since the pattern of L -&gt; Ls is known as a<br/>&quot;rabbit sequence&quot; by analogy to rabbit procreation, I&apos;m calling rings that receive their _L_ from the<br/>previous ring&apos;s _s_ &quot;mature rings.&quot;  It might not be totally clear as to why just from that brief<br/>description but it will become clear with a little meditation on the horagrams.</p><p>&gt; (I noticed that<br/>&gt; the branches of Ls -&gt; Lss -&gt; Lsss -&gt; Lssss didin&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem to go anywhere interesting, but there seemsed to<br/>&gt; be interesting things where SOME steps do this)...</p><p>Yes.  Once an _s_ &quot;grows up,&quot; or &quot;matures,&quot; as I prefer to say, it passes its size to the next ring<br/>as a new _L_.  Thus it doesn&apos;t continue to be Lssssss... forever.  Depending on the size of the<br/>generator, a great variety of Ls strings can result.  Again, the horagrams crystalize this concept.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

The type of things I would look for are<br/>some sort of system of small-number-ratio approximations<br/>(what we can call consonances), which are approachable from<br/>the characteristic interval by contrary motion (I want my<br/>musical investigations to start with basic counterpoint<br/>that I am familiar with).
