If someone&apos;s already mentioned it here, I<br/>apologize, but I can&apos;t remember seeing anything about it.</p><p>This Sunday(August 20th), the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New<br/>Hampshire will award Lou Harrison the Edward MacDowell Medal.  He<br/>will<br/>be the 41st person to recieve the medal.  It is rewarded in<br/>recognition of his long life time of experimentation and inovation in<br/>music.  Among the twelve other composers who have recieved the medal<br/>are Aaron Copland, Edgard Varese, Virgil Thomson, and Leonard<br/>Bernstein.  Following the award ceremony, there will be a gamelan<br/>concert.  For more information, go to <a href="http://www.macdowellcolony.org">www.macdowellcolony.org</a><br/>I will certainly be there, and I would recommend that anyone on this<br/>list in the area attend.  It should be a wonderful event, and it will<br/>be in a really beautiful setting.</p><p>I must be off now, but I hope to see some of you there on sunday, and<br/>I will probably be more active on the list once I get settled into a<br/>new apartment around here.</p><p>Peace, Love.</p><p>Alan</p></div>
