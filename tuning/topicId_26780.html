I imagine we will have the same sort of problems we have now<br/>when rock musicians try to jam with jazz musicians try to jam with<br/>classical musicians try to jam with indian musicians... only in the<br/>tuning area.

Good enough for rock and roll (and probably for<br/>Renaissance music, when lutes were in 12-tET, and keyboards were in<br/>meantone, typically around 31-tET).</p></div>
