Certainly it&apos;s possible to play<br/>neo-Gothic progressions in meantone, although not necessarily the<br/>ideal way to optimize ratios of 2-3-7.</p><p>Really, it&apos;s appropriate that we&apos;re discussing these questions,<br/>because it was your very patient and helpful experiments with<br/>neo-Gothic progressions in various tunings around the middle of last<br/>year, and your emphasis on really getting 7-based ratios accurate,<br/>that helped start me on my way to a 2-3-7 JI system. In many ways,<br/>it&apos;s a simple problem compared to the ratios and limits you juggle in<br/>your tunings.</p><p>Thank you also for convincing me that the term &quot;septimal schisma&quot; can<br/>mean different things to different people; your &quot;2-3-7 schisma&quot; nicely<br/>communicates the idea of the schisma equal to the difference of the<br/>2-3 or Pythagorean comma and the 3-7 or septimal comma.</p><p>As you noted, the Pythagorean comma is nicely expressed as the<br/>difference between six 9:8 whole-tones and a pure 2:1 octave; this<br/>comma is equal to 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents).</p><p>Now for the meantone question. This seems the _ideal_ solution if we<br/>want to mix Renaissance and neo-Gothic styles and intervals in the<br/>same piece using a single tuning, and really have those Renaissance<br/>sonorities shine.</p><p>A 24-note archicembalo inspired by the 36-note archicembalo of Nicola<br/>Vicentino (1511-1576) makes possible the wonderful effects for<br/>Renaissance music of the kind he champions, including &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>diesis or fifthtone progressions and &quot;proximate minor thirds&quot; (neutral<br/>thirds near 11:9). As a bonus, it provides lots of intervals useful<br/>for neo-Gothic music, such as the wide major third and the narrow<br/>minor third and seventh.</p><p>Apart from the special situation of mixing Renaissance and neo-Gothic<br/>styles in a single tuning, playing neo-Gothic intervals in meantone<br/>can be a fascinating intonational &quot;role reversal&quot; from which we can<br/>learn more about the music and the tuning alike. It&apos;s quite possible<br/>to demonstrate some sample cadences on a usual 12-note meantone<br/>keyboard, as I explain toward the end of this article.</p><p>However, if we&apos;re focusing on a 2-3-7 optimization specifically for<br/>neo-Gothic music, then I wouldn&apos;t call meantone either the simplest or<br/>the most accurate solution, although it&apos;s actually more accurate on<br/>the whole than the one simple solution, 22-tone equal temperament<br/>(22-tET) or something it its vicinity.</p><p>If we&apos;re focusing on simplicity, I would say that navigating a 24-note<br/>meantone temperament seems to me about as simple, or complicated, as<br/>getting around a more characteristically neo-Gothic scheme such as a<br/>24-note 2-3-7 JI system or e-based system (fifth ~704.61 cents).</p><p>Curiously, I consider a 24-note tuning in many ways less intricate<br/>than a 19-note tuning, since the symmetry of the two &quot;generalized&quot;<br/>12-note keyboards can help in finding intervals and cadences.</p><p>Here there may be two ways of approaching the 2-3-7 problem. The first<br/>is simply to compare the accuracy of different solutions; the second<br/>is also to look at a system as a whole in a given musical setting,<br/>including the question of how other intervals might fit in with a<br/>given style.</p><p>In a 24-note 2-3-7 JI scheme with two Pythagorean manuals a septimal<br/>comma apart, for example, we get all the usual Pythagorean intervals<br/>on either manual, as well as the new 7-based ones. The two types of<br/>intervals can nicely contrast with each other, and both fit a<br/>neo-Gothic style very nicely.</p><p>In a 24-note e-based tuning, similarly, we have a very characteristic<br/>12-note neo-Gothic tuning on each manual, as well as excellent<br/>approximations of 7-based intervals and an intriguing new type of<br/>cadential diesis at around 55 cents, large enough to feel like a<br/>semitone step.</p><p>Similarly, a 24-note meantone tuning gives us a beautiful set of<br/>regular intervals on each manual -- but this time optimized for<br/>Renaissance music, although we can certainly use it for neo-Gothic as<br/>well.</p><p>To borrow the title of a recent thread here, comparing optimizations<br/>is a matter of &quot;cents and sensibility,&quot; and the numbers are only part<br/>of the picture.</p><p>For example, 22-tET is generally the _least_ accurate 2-3-7 system on<br/>the table that follows, but it&apos;s also the one type of solution that I<br/>consider really simple: just tune up a 12-note chain of fifths and<br/>go. Of course, tuning the full set of 22 opens up possibilities for<br/>various special effects, but we only need 12 for a keyboard full of<br/>near-7 ratios as _regular_ intervals.</p><p>In fact, the appreciable compromise of the 3:2 and 7:4 in 22-tET<br/>reflects the heroic task this tuning takes on and accomplishes:<br/>dispersing the septimal comma (64:63, ~27.26 cents) in a chain of only<br/>2, 3, or 4 fifths to get regular intervals near 7:4, 7:6, and 9:7.</p><p>Let&apos;s compare some typical neo-Gothic solutions for 2-3-7 based on<br/>Pythagorean or wider fifths with two forms of Renaissance or<br/>neo-Renaissance meantone, and also a &quot;middle ground&quot; solution notable<br/>for its accuracy. The term &quot;schisma&quot; refers to the 2-3-7 schisma of<br/>around 3.80 cents:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>System        Size/5th chains   Fifth       7:4       7:6       9:7<br/>               (7:4,7:6,9:7)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                 Neo-Gothic systems (fifths 3:2 or wider)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>22-tET            12-22        ~709.09    ~981.82   ~272.73   ~436.36<br/>                 (2-3-4)        +~7.14    +~12.99    +~5.86    +~1.28<br/>.....................................................................<br/>2-3-7 JI*           24         ~701.96    ~968.83   ~266.87   ~435.08<br/>                (14-15-16)        pure       pure      pure      pure<br/>.....................................................................<br/>1/15 schisma        24         ~702.21    ~969.08   ~266.87   ~435.34<br/>                (14-15-16)      +~0.25     +~0.25      pure    +~0.25<br/>.....................................................................<br/>1/14 schisma        24         ~702.23    ~968.83   ~266.60   ~435.63<br/>(~135-tET)      (14-15-16)      +~0.27       pure    -~0.27    +~0.54<br/>.....................................................................<br/>e-based             24         ~704.61    ~969.10   ~264.50   ~440.11<br/>                (15-14-13)      +~2.65     +~0.28    -~2.37    +~5.03<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                       Middle ground system (36-tET)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>36-tET             24-36        700.00    ~966.67   ~266.67   ~433.33<br/>             (steps: 29-8-13)   -~1.95     -~2.16    -~0.20    -~1.75<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>             Renaissance or Renaissance-like meantone systems<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1/4 comma           24         ~696.58    ~965.78   ~269.20   ~427.37<br/>meantone         (10-9-8)       -~5.38     -~3.04    +~2.33    -~7.71<br/>.....................................................................<br/>Golden              24         ~696.21    ~962.14   ~265.93   ~430.28<br/>meantone         (10-9-8)       -~5.74     -~6.68    -~0.94    -~4.80<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>* Fifth between manuals (G#-D#) is 2-3-7 schisma wide (~3.80 cents)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>If we were concerned only about 2-3-7 accuracy, then a 2-3-7 JI system<br/>or regular schisma temperament leaving the fifths virtually pure would<br/>be our obvious choice.</p><p>Among listed systems, the next most accurate is 36-tET, with two<br/>manuals at 1/6-tone (~33.33 cents) apart. This tempers the fifths by<br/>about 1.95 cents, here in the narrow direction, and gives us, overall,<br/>more accurate 7-based approximations than any of the more heavily<br/>tempered alternatives.</p><p>The e-based tuning is next, with fifths about 2.65 cents from pure,<br/>this time in the wide direction; we get a virtually pure 7:4, with all<br/>of our 7-based intervals within just over 5 cents of pure.</p><p>With our meantones, the fifths are tempered in the narrow direction<br/>rather appreciably: 5.38 cents for 1/4-comma, likely Vicentino&apos;s<br/>tuning, and 5.74 cents for Thorwald Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone. We get<br/>a 7:6 close to pure in either tuning -- within one cent in Golden<br/>Meantone. However, optimizing both the 7:4 and the 9:7 at the same<br/>time presents a bit of a dilemma; 1/4-comma does nicely for the 7:4,<br/>while Golden Meantone is kinder for the 9:7.</p><p>Nevertheless, either of these meantones is more accurate both for the<br/>fifth and for overall 7-based ratios than 22-tET (fifth ~7.14 cents<br/>wide), although 22-tET features a near-pure 9:7, in fact better than<br/>any other system where the fifth is substantially tempered.</p><p>In reality, however, accuracy isn&apos;t the only issue: other musical<br/>features and values make each of these systems an attractive option.</p><p>With the superaccurate JI and schisma systems, we get the regular<br/>Pythagorean intervals on each 12-note keyboard, a delightful mixture<br/>of the old and the new.</p><p>With the e-based system, we get a regular minor sixth (~781.57 cents)<br/>only about 0.91 cents narrow of 11:7, and lots of other characteristic<br/>neo-Gothic ratios like &quot;submajor/supraminor&quot; thirds not too far from<br/>17:14 and 21:17, here a bit on the neutralish side, as well as a &quot;Wolf<br/>fourth&quot; (e.g. Eb-G#, 11 fifths up) within one cent of 11:8.</p><p>With 22-tET, of course, we get a neo-Gothic equivalent of meantone for<br/>ratios of 2-3-7, with the septimal comma neatly dispersed, unlike any<br/>of the other system where this comma (or some analogous interval) is<br/>in play to complicate as well as sometimes enrich things.</p><p>With meantone, we get an optimized tuning for conventional and<br/>experimental Renaissance music alike, both styles described by<br/>Vicentino, as well as the intervals of special interest from a<br/>neo-Gothic perspective. For example, we can use the 427-cent third<br/>both as a meantone diminished fourth (wonderfully illustrated in some<br/>Renaissance pieces) and as a neo-Gothic major third.</p><p>With 36-tET, we get a basic 12-tET tuning on either keyboard that in<br/>appropriate timbres might serve as a compromise intonation for mixing<br/>medieval and Renaissance styles, as well as the 7-based intervals and<br/>excellent submajor/supraminor thirds (~333.33 cents, ~366.67 cents)<br/>of the neo-Gothic &quot;17-flavor&quot; (around 21:17 and 17:14).</p><p>Having discussed some of the issues of &quot;cents&quot; -- and hopefully also<br/>of &quot;sensibility&quot; -- why don&apos;t I briefly give examples of a couple of<br/>neo-Gothic progressions available on a 12-note meantone keyboard in<br/>the usual Eb-G# range. Here I use a MIDI-style octave notation where<br/>C4 is middle C:</p><p>Eb4  E4<br/>Bb3  B3<br/>F#3  E3</p><p>Let&apos;s assume that we&apos;re in 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 major<br/>thirds. Here we have a standard Gothic cadence with major third<br/>expanding to fifth, and major sixth to octave, bringing us to a<br/>complete 2:3:4 trine on E3-B3-E4.</p><p>In our musical &quot;role reversal,&quot; the meantone diminished fourth F#3-Bb3<br/>at 32:25 becomes our 427-cent neo-Gothic major third, and the<br/>diminished seventh F#3-Eb4 becomes our near-12:7 major sixth.</p><p>Also, as we see in this cadence, the meantone chromatic semitone, the<br/>_smaller_ semitone of this tuning at around 76.05 cents, becomes our<br/>neo-Gothic diatonic semitone: here Bb3-B3 and Eb4-E4 in the two upper<br/>voices.</p><p>How about a meantone version of a cadence with a narrow minor seventh<br/>contracting to a fifth, and an upper minor third contracting to a<br/>unison? Here&apos;s another example available on a 12-note keyboard in<br/>Eb-G# tuning:</p><p>C#4 B3<br/>Bb3 B3<br/>Eb3 E3</p><p>Our neo-Gothic cadence takes the meantone augmented sixth Eb3-C#4 as<br/>our near-7:4 seventh; the augmented second Bb3-C#4 serves as our<br/>near-7:6 minor third. Again the 76-cent meantone chromatic semitone,<br/>here Eb3-E3 or Bb3-B3 (two lower voices), becomes our usual cadential<br/>semitone.</p><p>In a 24-note tuning with the manuals a diesis apart, the wide major<br/>thirds and sixths are a diesis larger than the usual meantone<br/>intervals, and the narrow minor thirds and sevenths a diesis smaller.<br/>Here are versions corresponding to our two examples, using an ASCII<br/>asterisk (*) for Vicentino&apos;s dot above a note showing that it is<br/>raised by a diesis:</p><p>E*4  F4        D4  C4<br/>B*3  C4        B*3 C4<br/>G3   F3        E*3 F3</p><p>The &quot;look and feel&quot; of a 24-note meantone is rather similar to that of<br/>a 24-note neo-Gothic scheme, or 24-out-of-36-tET for that matter: we<br/>play fifths and fourths on the same keyboard, with 7-based intervals<br/>combining notes from the two keyboards.</p><p>I&apos;d call this &quot;moderately intricate&quot;: the chain of fifths doesn&apos;t get<br/>disrupted, unlike in some traditional JI systems (e.g. the syntonic<br/>diatonic for 2-3-5), and we can play anything on either keyboard that<br/>we could in the base 12-note system.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
