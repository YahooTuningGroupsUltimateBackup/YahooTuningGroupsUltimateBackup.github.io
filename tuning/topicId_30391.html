For an A, you have to<br/>extend the slide; it is &quot;somewhere out there&quot;. If you tune to D,<br/>you always have the option of lowering your Bb for a larger<br/>third. If you tune to Bb, you should stay away from first<br/>position D unless you really want the 5/4 (in actual practice, I<br/>think you just extend your slide by a comma. I do it that way).<br/>The point of all this was that C is not a very useful note for<br/>brass players to relate to, but that they are well served with<br/>either Bb or D (you<br/>can&apos;t, and shouldn&apos;t, have both from 12tET) or A.</p><p>klaus</p></div>
