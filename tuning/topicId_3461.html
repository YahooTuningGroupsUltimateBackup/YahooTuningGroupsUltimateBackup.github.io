While I am anxious to find out more through<br/>such testing, my own experience with choirs leads me to believe that,<br/>unless you are talking about the Hilliard Ensemble or Anonymous 4 or some<br/>other professional specialists in early choral chamber music, it is for<br/>practical purposes meaningless to speak of tuning systems in choral music<br/>with the same precision that we do with keyboards.</p><p>First of all, singers in choirs virtually never agree on a particular<br/>pitch. To a limited extent, you *want* this &quot;spread&quot; of pitches around a<br/>hypothetical center pitch to give the richness of the aptly-named &quot;chorus<br/>effect.&quot; In my experience, this spread can range 15 cents or more, i.e. the<br/>distance between the 5/4 and equal tempered third. Second, there is<br/>vibrato, which, with Western singers untrained in early music, frequently<br/>has a deviation of a semitone.</p><p>OK, so, ideally, the spread and all the vibratos should still center around<br/>a theoretical &quot;ideal&quot; pitch which spectral software should identify (given<br/>a low enough sampling rate and a window size that is large enough to be<br/>precise but small enough not to mask pitch drift). Still, intonation<br/>effects, particularly beats, are greatly masked by these phenomena. (How<br/>many times have I heard the vibrato get wider at intonationally sensitive<br/>points...)</p><p>Third, the tuning of an interval in an a capella context frequently depends<br/>on the melodic as well as the harmonic context. Melodic motion up,<br/>especially in the case of the leading tone, will tend to sharpen a pitch,<br/>for example. Dissonant or ambiguous chords will allow for a greater<br/>deviation from JI, and perhaps that is even desirable. I&apos;m sure that the<br/>timbre of vowels will also affect intonation. Then there are pitch scoops,<br/>drift over time, instability as breath goes, and so on.</p><p>So, until I see more empirical evidence to the contrary, I will continue to<br/>believe that to expect the kind of consistency and accuracy necessary to<br/>see commatic shifts in most choirs is quite unrealistic. I seem to recall<br/>that Seashore&apos;s old study with college choirs found this.</p><p>One point about the Renaissance, though. There is evidence that so-called<br/>&quot;a capella&quot; music of the period was in fact frequently accompanied by<br/>instruments ad libitum. Of course this practice varied in time and<br/>geographic region, especially once the Reformation took hold. If the choir<br/>was accompanied by an organ, well, then they would of course tend to that<br/>tuning. If the choir was accompanied by wind instruments, then those<br/>instruments, too, had a certain amount of intonational inconsistency.</p><p>I remember back in my crumhorn-playing days that those beasts had easily a<br/>range of a minor third either way on a given fingering, just by varying the<br/>air pressure. A good deal of our rehearsals was given to intonation, but to<br/>expect that we could accurately and consistently represent a distinction<br/>between 12TET and JI would be asking a lot.</p><p>So I hope to see more spectral studies!</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

I&apos;m sure this depends on<br/>lots of things like who they are, what culture, thier level of training, the<br/>kind of music etc. I&apos;d really be surprised if there was nothing to learn<br/>from an investigation like this.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;First of all, singers in choirs virtually never agree on a particular<br/>&gt;pitch.

Second, there is<br/>&gt;vibrato, which, with Western singers untrained in early music, frequently<br/>&gt;has a deviation of a semitone.</p><p>The spread is certainly there but the energy is usally centered in a<br/>narrower portion of the band, mostly in the middle. A group of people<br/>singing together, unless hopeless, will no doubt be synergistically<br/>influencing each other to create a &quot;gestalt&quot; tuning for the part. This<br/>includes the &quot;chorus effect&quot; but a chorus effect centered on the intended<br/>pitch.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK, so, ideally, the spread and all the vibratos should still center around<br/>&gt;a theoretical &quot;ideal&quot; pitch which spectral software should identify (given<br/>&gt;a low enough sampling rate and a window size that is large enough to be<br/>&gt;precise but small enough not to mask pitch drift). Still, intonation<br/>&gt;effects, particularly beats, are greatly masked by these phenomena. (How<br/>&gt;many times have I heard the vibrato get wider at intonationally sensitive<br/>&gt;points...)</p><p>I suppose it might be hard to pin down the frequency of Renata Squatto or<br/>some other singer with a vibrato big enough to drive a truck through. Not<br/>all singers sing like this. I was just listening to a recording of emma<br/>calve from1908 where she sings a little french ditty with just about the<br/>purest steady tone ive ever heard (too bad shes singing with a piano).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Third, the tuning of an interval in an a capella context frequently depends<br/>&gt;on the melodic as well as the harmonic context.

Then there are pitch scoops,<br/>&gt;drift over time, instability as breath goes, and so on.</p><p>This is &gt;exactly&lt; the phenomenology that needs to be examined.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, until I see more empirical evidence to the contrary, I will continue to<br/>&gt;believe that to expect the kind of consistency and accuracy necessary to<br/>&gt;see commatic shifts in most choirs is quite unrealistic. I seem to recall<br/>&gt;that Seashore&apos;s old study with college choirs found this.</p><p>Theres only one way to know for sure.</p><p>&gt;So I hope to see more spectral studies!</p><p>Id be willing to put up spectral studies as part of my website or at least<br/>link to anyones studies on their own site.
