No reason to open<br/>your mouth and leave them no doubt. (JOSH KIDDING)Tell anything at ALL to anyone at ALL and suddenly you become a hermit as most people would rather not think AT ALL for the very first time in their lives, and settle for the pain and confusion that stems from the fear of the unknown experience of having a brain that functions.</p><p>In LA: &quot;Rick REED, this pain is all we know.
