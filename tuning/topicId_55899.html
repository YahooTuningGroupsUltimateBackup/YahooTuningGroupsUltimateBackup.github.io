However, we can do even better; the first division I<br/>find actually *in* the poptimal range is 46032, and by good luck it<br/>happens to be excellent so far as divisors for the commas go. If we<br/>give these units a name (say &quot;flu&quot; for five-limit units) we get a<br/>system suited both to expressing 5-limit pure intervals with great<br/>exactitude, supporting atomic temperament, and with nicely divisible<br/>commas.</p><p>We have:</p><p>Pythagorean comma: 900 flus 900=2^2 3^2 5^2<br/>Didymus comma: 825 flus 825 = 3 5^2 11<br/>Schisma: 75 flus<br/>Major third: 14819 flus<br/>Fifth: 26927 flus<br/>Octave: 46032 flus<br/>1/12 octave: 3836 flus<br/>Cent: 38.36 flus exactly</p><p>If &quot;flu&quot; makes you ill, there is always &quot;dc&quot; for Diophantine clarity<br/>units. 825 is an odd number, and we need 206.25 for how much the fifth<br/>is flattended fdrom 26927 to get a 1/4 comma fifth, but we get some<br/>fractions of a Didymus comma to come out integrally, and do even<br/>better with the Pythagorean comma.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2004 6:11:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/> However, we can do even better; the first division I<br/>&gt; find actually *in* the poptimal range is 46032, and by good luck it<br/>&gt; happens to be excellent so far as divisors for the commas go.
