I listened again and I was<br/>exhausted. I listened to the end and I was puzzled. I became perturbed - unable to<br/>speak clearly - and , finally, I lost my sense of self-assurance.&apos;<br/>    The Yellow Emperor answered: &apos;That is exactly the effect I expected!<br/>Ideal Music<br/>primarily must attain its powers of effect in the Earthly Realm of Sentient<br/>Beings.<br/>    &apos;It must be in [dynamic] balance with the Principles of Heaven and tread<br/>the Way of the Five Virtues. It should be mixed with spontaneity - resulting<br/>in the ordering the sequence of the Four Seasons, bringing powerful Harmony to<br/>Life Itself.<br/>    This will be evidenced in the sequence of the Four Seasons - birthing all<br/>life. One moment expanding, at another contracting [ ... ] One moment clear,<br/>at another obscured - the Yin-&amp;-Yang are in Harmony - the Sounds flow out.<br/>    &apos;Next I played this music with the Harmony of Yin-&amp;-Yang - illuminating<br/>it with the light of the sun and moon. Tones flooded vales and canyons; it is<br/>futile for you to attempt to dam them out or guard your spirit for such<br/>tonalities rush were they will. I ceased and the music ceased but the Sounds flowed<br/>onward.&apos;<br/>    &apos;This perturbed you - you could not comprehend this - you searched for<br/>them, but could not find them - you pursued them, but could not capture them.<br/>You were stunned so you stand before the universal evidence of the Tao or<br/>stagger against an old tree and groan. Your eyes could not perceive, so failed you -<br/>your strength retreated into the earth. I could not grab it. Your body melted<br/>into emptiness - you lost control, attaining liberation. This is what<br/>exhausted you.<br/>    &apos;In the final part, I played tones that did not exhaust you. I brought<br/>them together spontaneously. Some call this Death, others Life. Some call it the<br/>fruit, others the flower. The tones moved, flowed, separated and changed<br/>following no evident order. Naturally, the Earthly Realm is uncertain in regards<br/>to this. The world seeks wisdom from Sages, believing the Sage to comprehend<br/>True Form and True Destiny. &quot;Listening for it, you do not hear it. Searching for<br/>it, you miss its form. It fills all Heaven and Earth, encompassing the Six<br/>Directions.&quot;<br/>    &apos;You desire to hear it, but it is beyond you thus it perplexed you.&apos;<br/>    &apos; I first performed the music to create awe... because of this awe, fear<br/>reared-up like some ghost-demon. Then I brought upon exhaustion, this<br/>exhaustion induced complacency in you. I ended with confusion, making you feel<br/>ignorant.&apos;<br/>    &apos;But it is this ignorance that reveals the Tao, the Tao that can be<br/>embodied within you wherever you may be.&apos; &quot;</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang</p><p>    &quot;...So what is life for? Life is for beauty and substance and sound and<br/>colour; and even those are often forbidden by law [socio-cultural conventions].<br/>. . . Why not be free and live your own life? Why follow other people&apos;s rules<br/>and live to please others?...&quot; ~Lieh-Tzu/Liezi, Taoist Sage (c. 450- c. 375<br/>BCE)</p><p>    &quot;To live is to scrounge, taking what you can in order to survive. So,<br/>since living is scrounging, the result of our efforts is to amass a pile of<br/>rubbish.&quot;<br/>                            - Chuang Tzu/Zhuangzi, China, 4th Century BCE</p><p>    &quot;The most beautiful order is a heap of sweepings piled up at random.&quot;<br/>                            - Heraclitus, Greece, 5th Century BCE</p><p>    Ars imitatur Naturam in sua operatione.<br/>    [Latin &gt; &quot;Art is the imitation of Nature in her manner of operation.&quot;]</p><p>    &quot; jinsei to iu mono wa, kichou na geijyutsu to ieru deshou &quot;<br/>    [Japanese &gt; &quot;one can probably say that &apos;life&apos; is a precious artform&quot;]<br/>    in more radical, paracultural terms: &quot;the (R)Evolution of the Everyday&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is no total revolution, there is only _perpetual_ Revolution,<br/>real life, like love, dazzling at every moment.&quot; - Paul Eluard</p><p>-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----<br/>  Version: 3.1<br/>GFA/H/L/MC/MU/SS  d---  s:  a39  C++  U?
