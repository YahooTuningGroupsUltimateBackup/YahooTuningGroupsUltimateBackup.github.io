Around 1200,<br/>&gt; when Perotin and other composers begin writing regularly for three or<br/>&gt; four voices, these intervals can actually have a relatively blending<br/>&gt; effect when combined with two fifths or fourths.<br/>&gt;</p><p>...at which point my head was suddenly filled with &apos;Mysterious Voices<br/>of the Balkans&apos;, which contains many interesting uses of &quot;M2&quot; oriented<br/>harmonization.</p><p>But if my head was filled properly, the major thirds seem to be 5/4<br/>(or even flatter, toward some neutral third), the m7 could be 7/4,<br/>but the M2 is certainly NOT an 8/7...</p><p>Anyone have tuning references for this music?</p><p>thanks a lot,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=4033 href="#4033">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>7/27/1999 7:37:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>While doing transcriptions as part of my ethnomusicology studies of Bosnian<br/>Moslem lullabyes supposedly sung  to children while they are going to sleep<br/>at night, I came across harmonic M2 at the beginning and at the final cadence.</p><p>For years I wondered how the 9/8 was elevated to a consonance and kept some<br/>doubt.  However in 1997 I became friends at a summer camp with a 17-year old<br/>music star from Sarajevo named Alma.  She performs Bosnia rock, hip hop, and<br/>all manners of original Bosnia music ( I have her album...which is great!)</p><p>One day I asked her to sing with me my transcription (which I kept 15 years<br/>after doing it).  She recognized it and sang the 9/8 as well as several<br/>quartertone intervals right on and we did perform it.  I actually use part of<br/>this for the trombone in my Odysseus cello concerto (played by the holy cow).</p><p>Yes, they do hear the sound spectrum in an apparently idiosyncratic manner.<br/>This does not seem to be the case for the other peoples in the area.<br/>Incidentlly, Bosnia Moslems settled their land before theire were Serbs and<br/>Croats, and are oft consdiered to be descended from a wayward Ostrogoth tribe<br/>(the Besii).</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br/><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4052 href="#4052">ðŸ”—</a>Rick Tagawa &#x3C;ricktagawa@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/1999 12:10:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Looking at Polegnala e Todora I have it starting on a sharpened P4 (+17&#xFFFD;)<br/>using a 72-tET followed by the P5.  The two notes are held together.<br/>Danielou might call it tone #24 of his universal scale or Sruti 10.<br/>Basically it is the 27/20 interval under discussion several months ago.  I<br/>think someone said it was a preferred interval in some cultures.  Others<br/>said that it was unusable.</p><p>Robert C Valentine wrote:</p><p>&gt; my head was suddenly filled with &apos;Mysterious Voices<br/>&gt; of the Balkans&apos;, which contains many interesting uses of &quot;M2&quot; oriented<br/>&gt; harmonization &lt;snip&gt;M2 is certainly NOT an 8/7...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone have tuning references for this music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks a lot,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
