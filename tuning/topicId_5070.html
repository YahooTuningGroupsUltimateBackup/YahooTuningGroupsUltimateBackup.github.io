In these cases, the short, stiff length of wire between the bridge and the hitch pin impairs the motion of the soundboard and bridge assembly, essentially reducing their ability to transmit the lower tones, ie fundamental. Additionally, it has been discussed on the Pianotech list by Del Fandrich that the bass bridge apron adds a distorting (and so stiffening) force to the soundboard, which serves further to reduce the tone of these fundamentals.</p><p>Clark</p></div>
