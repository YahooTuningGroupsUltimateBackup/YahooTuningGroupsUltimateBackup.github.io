The vibrations of musical strings have moved the best of minds.  Brian Wilson wrote a rock symphony about those magic musical intervals.  In his younger days Brother Brian would take his trusty tuning wrench to the piano of the day, tempering the strings--flattening some, sharpening others--until he was pleased more than repulsed.  Franklin took me back to my early days as a roadie for the Beach Boys.  At sound checks Brian would tinker and tweak and every so often he would howl like a wolf.  Until Franklin&apos;s article, I never knew Brian was reacting to a murderous &apos;wolf-tone.&apos;  I just<br/>thought he was stressed.&quot;</p><p>--Dave Rao</p></div>
