When in doubt, explicitly saying<br/>&gt;&quot;5-odd-limit&quot; or &quot;5-prime-limit&quot; solves any question of ambiguity.</p><p>The definition I contributed to the tuning dictionary, and which Keenan<br/>Pepper put forward independently, makes this an issue of context, not<br/>cultural perspective. When discussing a tuning system of JI pitches, apart<br/>from the music made upon it, the prime-limit usage is indicated. When<br/>discussing the level of intervallic complexity that a style or composer or<br/>composition uses as the standard for consonance/stability, the odd-limit<br/>usage is indicated. Of course, there could still be ambiguous cases, but<br/>both these usages derive from Partch, so occasional ambiguity is to be<br/>expected :) :) :) (BG)</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We have moved!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
