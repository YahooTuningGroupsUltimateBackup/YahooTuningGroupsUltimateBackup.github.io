I just exploited the right to voice my opinion on a subject that most perplexes me, which is not very much possible around this part of the world as you should know. Afterall, I was not born in Rio, never been to Berlin, but perhaps to Cologne a several times, and though I have visited New York twice, never had the chance to live there. That is to say nothing of my world travels which would be dwarfed in comparison to your African Safaris! How should I be able to make any claims to the extent to which you are affliated with &grave;alien cultures&grave;?</p><p>So, silencing or choosing to silence a man who is only guilty of mild emotional turmoils when confronted with a challenging subject does not suit one like yourself, no matter how sensitive you may be to particular topics, who boasts of having sightseen the globe and taken a residence in the States. Maybe you should work on the tolerance part a little next to modesty, which I believe are essential factors in being open-minded.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Mr. Ozan Yarman<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Cris Forster<br/>  To: Tuning<br/>  Sent: 27 May&imath;s 2005 Cuma 6:17<br/>  Subject: [tuning] RE: A question about &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; scales?</p><p>  Dear Moderator, and To Whom It May Concern:</p><p>  I am writing with respect to Message # 58733.</p><p>  Regarding this message, which I copied and pasted below,<br/>  I take full responsibility for my text that follows the greeting:</p><p>  &quot;Dear Aline Honingh,&quot;</p><p>  However, directly above my email, there appears an anonymous<br/>  vacuous commentary marked with quotation marks ( &gt; ) that is<br/>  addressed to no one.</p><p>  Above that appears an equally vacuous commentary signed by<br/>  Mr. Ozan Yarman, but again addressed to no one.
