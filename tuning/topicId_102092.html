Thanks.</p><p>I think the list is too long, with 45 temperaments in the main sequence as compared with 21 and 28 for 5 and 7 limit main sequences. I&apos;d say it should not have more than 35 temperaments max (linear progression of temperament counts).</p><p>And I can&apos;t help thinking that with more than 800 temperament names now in Graham&apos;s database, if something doesn&apos;t have a name by now it can&apos;t be very interesting. As usual I&apos;m astonished at how much of the subsequent discussion revolved around naming the new temperaments that popped up, rather than whether they ought to be on this list in the first place.</p><p>This list doesn&apos;t have to be all things to all people. There can be other 11-limit lists. This one is merely attempting to continue on from &quot;Middle Path&quot;. If it is biased toward low complexity, so be it, provided that it has (in some sense) the _same_ bias as the 5 and 7 limit lists from &quot;Middle Path&quot;.</p><p>So if that means that we have to leave Miracle off the list, then I say so be it. It really is quite complex at the 11 limit. Only Blackjack (Miracle-21) has been used in non-algorithmic composition as far as I know, and that does not include a complete 11-limit diamond. Unless you want to claim Partch&apos;s 43 as a detempered modified Miracle-41.</p><p>Is it possible that Miracle could be included as a &quot;bonus&quot; 11-limit temperament, without having to also include a whole host of others? The criterion for bonus temperaments seems to be much lower _product_ badness than anything in the main sequence. Where &quot;product badness&quot; is damage _multiplied_by_ complexity, where damage and complexity are as used by Paul Erlich in Middle Path.</p><p>I guess at this stage I could actually ask Paul what _he_ thinks.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I started <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Catalog+of+eleven-limit+rank+two+temperaments">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Catalog+of+eleven-limit+rank+two+temperaments</a> .
