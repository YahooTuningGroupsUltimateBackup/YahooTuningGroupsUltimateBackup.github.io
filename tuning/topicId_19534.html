It usually requires at least a 4 cent departure from ET for<br/>them to tell that there is something different.  I have also checke quite a<br/>few of my acquaintances against the tuning computer and find that &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>is pretty loose.  Most can tell if a note is 6 cents away from &quot;norm&quot;,(such<br/>as the C or E in a Young) but as far as their &quot;perfection&quot; being useful as a<br/>tuning skill, no way.<br/>  There was one young oboe player at Vanderbilt several years ago that could<br/>put her pitch on A440 with no more than 1/2 cent error, repeatedly!

Since I&apos;ve relied on a tuning fork for accuracy in<br/>piano tunings for so long, my &quot;shot-in-the-dark&quot; C can vary widely<br/>depending on all sorts of outside factors. However, my work as an<br/>electronics technician involved the use of metering devices that are<br/>audible, not visual, and those skills got honed pretty finely. I can pick<br/>out or reproduce a 1 khz tone with about that oboists&apos;s accumen and I can<br/>pick out intonational variations in an undertone series much more<br/>accurately than in an overtone series. (THe pitch on my resistance and<br/>capacitance bridges falls in direct porportion to the value of the<br/>component so I got accustomed to hearing those increments. --<br/>Jay</p></div>
