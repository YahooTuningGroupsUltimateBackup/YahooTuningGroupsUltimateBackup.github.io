Guitarist Steve Kimock, who is well known on the jam band scene, talks and demonstrates how the 12 tone system is out of tune with the overtones, and shows how he bends strings to get them on the correct JI pitches. It&apos;s well done, and there&apos;s a concise definition of what JI is. It&apos;s good that this is happening in a mag like GP, and it&apos;s also interesting that it was written by someone that is not generally known to be a microtonal player/theorist.
