I would expect 99% of jazz musicians to reject the second chord as a<br/>G13#11 in this context of coming right after a 12-tET version of the same<br/>chord. I humbly suggest you do two things: present each chord in an<br/>appropriate &quot;jazz&quot; context, and post an alternate version based on the<br/>tuning I proposed (though I notice you didn&apos;t include the 9th in yours (we<br/>should ask Dan if he meant for there to be a 9th in the chord -- Dan?)).</p></div><h3><a id=11762 href="#11762">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2000 7:39:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
