Our story today brings out the bells. A carillon is a<br/>collection of tuned bells arranged so they may be played as if they<br/>were the strings of some piano or organ. The bells are hung in a<br/>stationary manner and the clappers are connected to a mechanical<br/>keyboard played with fists and feet. Expert playing requires musical<br/>dexterity, strength and endurance -- an art form that is rarely seen<br/>and slowly but surely disappearing from the planet. The bells and the<br/>mechanism to play the bells often weigh several tons and are normally<br/>stashed away in some bell tower to be heard and not seen. We were<br/>recently treated to a wonderful performance in the open air and at<br/>ground level of a carillon at the Texas Renaissance Festival. The<br/>act, called &quot;Cast in Bronze&quot; was inspirational. <a href="http://castinbronze.com">castinbronze.com</a> will<br/>give you some additional information.<br/>................</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
