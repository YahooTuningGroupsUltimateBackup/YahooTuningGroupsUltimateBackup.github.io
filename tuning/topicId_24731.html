Only through &quot;experience&quot; in<br/>overtone singing can one understand what I&apos;m talking about regarding the<br/>sure-footedness of aiming for and then executing a 386 cent interval.  I can<br/>hear it in my mind and then pull it out, emanating non-vibrato for maximum<br/>clarity.</p><p>Have you considered that your doubts as to accuracy are based on numbers by<br/>scientists for average people, not virtuoso microtonal musicians?  You do<br/>realize I am not talking only about myself but about many other musicians who<br/>are my colleagues?  And you know that I am the arbiter for final intonation?<br/>When the notes are not read correctly I complain.  If it is a 1 cent<br/>difference, it&apos;s due more to vibrato than to pitch center.  Hence, AFMMers do<br/>much without vibrato.  No sense, running interference to meaningful<br/>intervals, especially if it does damage to intent.  Am I making musical<br/>decisions...yep.</p><p>Maybe through instruction over a period of time, you would gain skills to<br/>hear more for yourself instead of only trusting a machine.  Simply testing a<br/>finished product won&apos;t work, because it doesn&apos;t guarantee &quot;intent.&quot;  For now,<br/>I&apos;m going to a wedding.  Now, you might not believe I am actually going to a<br/>wedding, and challenge this assertion.  But it will still be true. :)  (no,<br/>it&apos;s not my wedding.)  Bye for now.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
