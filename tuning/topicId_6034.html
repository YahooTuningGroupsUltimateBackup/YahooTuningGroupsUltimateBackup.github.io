I&apos;d never do that.</p><p>[Joe Monzo:]<br/>&gt; What tuning sounds best in any particular instant is highly<br/>dependent on many contextual factors,</p><p>Amen. Inspired and talented folks will make what works work... And<br/>when you say: &quot;Of course, how one tunes a particular harmony is one&apos;s<br/>own prerogative, but I think it&apos;s wrong to use such strongly<br/>disapproving language,&quot; I personally couldn&apos;t agree more... little<br/>else bothers me as much as when people assume (or even benignly imply)<br/>that what works best (or what&apos;s &apos;the good stuff&apos; and what &apos;sucks&apos;) for<br/>them, is what works best (or holds true) for you too. But that&apos;s me. I<br/>also understand that that is exactly the way that a lot of people<br/>clear out their space and focus their objectives... unfortunately (or<br/>at least it seems this way to me) the divergent ways that people<br/>naturally &apos;speak&apos; and &apos;interpret&apos; can often seem frustratingly garish,<br/>or one-dimensional, in this particular forum (meaning the medium in<br/>general and not the TD in particular), and as such, simple opinions<br/>and expressions (can) often seem distortedly blunt or obtuse (etc.).</p><p>[Joe Monzo:]<br/>&gt; The point I&apos;m making here is that it *still* sounds like an &apos;A major<br/>triad&apos;, and in the context in which I use it here, it is important to<br/>the dynamic musical movement of the voices that it is *not* tuned in<br/>the usual JI way.</p><p>Right on Mr. Monzo! I think that one of the great liberations of an<br/>expanded intonational palette IS having so many multiple conflicting<br/>interpretations of something as well thumbed as the major triad... I<br/>mean to my ways of working and thinking, this was EXACTLY why I was<br/>initially so fired up about the possibilities of &quot;microtonality&quot;: It<br/>seemed to bode well for the possibilities of &quot;music.&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div>
