It was a good excercise in subverting twelve tone technique in the name of tonality or at least what made sense to me for the work i.e. rows that always fall on consonances, mutaully exclusive triads, tertian circles, yada yada.</p><p>It&apos;s a very nostalgic piece BUT it is sincere. The ghost of Satie lended a helping (dismembered) hand.</p><p>Happy haunting,</p><p>-Patrick Grant<br/><a href="http://www.patrickgrant.com">www.patrickgrant.com</a></p><p>*******</p><p>nEWS for October</p><p>An MP3 of the new CD single &quot;Imaginary Horror Film&quot; (CD 013) has been posted on our web site here:</p><p><a href="http://www.strangemusic.com/IHF%20MP3s.htm">http://www.strangemusic.com/IHF%20MP3s.htm</a></p><p>A hi-speed internet connection is recommended or you can &quot;right click&quot; and &quot;save target as...&quot; Have some candy corn while you wait.</p><p>IMAGINARY HORROR FILM</p><p>01.
