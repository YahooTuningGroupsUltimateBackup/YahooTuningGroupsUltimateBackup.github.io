If my English were better I would love to<br/>present a translation right now. But anyway, here are a few comments.</p><p>Actually, the letter does not refer to the instrument on the photography.<br/>This instrument, obviously made by Appunn, has a little lever (or stop?)<br/>attached to each key and may very well feature 48 tones per octave.</p><p>The instrument, mentioned in Appunns letter, has 36 notes per octave, and it<br/>achieves this in a rather odd way. According to the description, all three<br/>5-octave keyboards are tuned to &quot;mathematically pure&quot; fifths. While the<br/>bottom keyboard has a = 435 Hz as a reference, the middle one is tuned a<br/>80/81 comma lower, and the top one again lower by the same margin, so that<br/>for instance a just major triad consists of c and g on the bottom keyboard<br/>and e on the middle one.</p><p>The other cord examples, which Appunn gives, are not always consistent, and<br/>much of the tuning remains open to speculation. May be that that was<br/>intended. The price he asks for his harmonium, however, comes out very clear:<br/>950 Reichsmark, which translate into some 50,000 nowaday&apos;s dollars (the<br/>annual income of an industrial worker was about 500 to 600 Reichsmark at that<br/>time). And the delivery time was just marvelous: about 2 months.</p><p>Thank you, Manuel. A very intriguing find!</p><p>-Heinz</p></div><h3><a id=32996 href="#32996">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 6:28:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., HPBOHLEN@A... wrote:</p><p>&gt; The instrument, mentioned in Appunns letter, has 36 notes per<br/>octave, and it<br/>&gt; achieves this in a rather odd way.

Obviously Appunn had<br/>come across the weakness of his first proposal, and he hastens to tell<br/>Blaserna in just a single sentence that he had &quot;forgotten&quot; to mention that 4<br/>keyboards, offering a total of 48 tones per octave, represented a &quot;still more<br/>perfect&quot; solution, with a price tag of now 1200 Reichsmark.</p><p>That seems to have convinced Blaserna. On June 21 Appunn answers a letter of<br/>Blaserna that is dated June 18 (compare the swiftness of the post service<br/>more than hundred years ago with today&apos;s snail mail!) and obviously contains<br/>favorable conditions. Blaserna&apos;s eagerness makes Appunn both inventive and<br/>bold. He has come to the conclusion that 4 keyboards might be a bit awkward<br/>to play. Thus he offers a system of little buttons that penetrate each key<br/>and permit playing the next higher keyboard without taking the hands from the<br/>lower one. This way the number of keyboards can be reduced to 3 again (one is<br/>&quot;hidden&quot;) with still 48 tones per octave available. He is bold insofar as he<br/>anticipates that Blaserna will order this instrument despite the fact that<br/>the price now will go up to 1500 Reichsmark (some 70 to 80,000 dollars at<br/>today&apos;s value). He was obviously correct in that anticipation, because the<br/>instrument pictured on the &quot;armonium&quot; website corresponds to the description<br/>above.</p><p>By the way: Appunn was well known in his days as a manufacturer not only of<br/>musical instruments but also of scientific acoustical apparatus (compare &quot;A<br/>Laboratory Course in Physiological Psychology&quot; by Edmund C. Sanford, American<br/>Journal of Psychology, 4, 1891, pp. 303-322).</p><p>Thank you once more, Manuel, for digging this up.</p><p>-Heinz</p></div><h3><a id=33298 href="#33298">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>1/28/2002 7:49:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Heinz, an interesting story.
