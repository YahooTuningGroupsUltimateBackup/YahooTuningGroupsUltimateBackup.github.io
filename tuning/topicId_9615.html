Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2000 12:10:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;The main reason your metric doesn&apos;t &quot;work&quot; for me is that it assigns the<br/>&gt;&gt;same distance for 15/8 as for 5/3. 5/3 is much more consonant than 15/8<br/>and<br/>&gt;&gt;thus should receive a shorter distance.</p><p>Keenan wrote,</p><p>&gt;I disagree. This is just my opinion, but 15/8 and 5/3 are both a third from<br/>&gt;a fifth, and are the same distance from 1/1 (along with 16/15 and 6/5).</p><p>That&apos;s true on the rectangular lattice, but on the triangular lattice, the<br/>minor third or major sixth gets a line of its own. It occurs very early in<br/>the harmonic series, and so is quite consonant, regardless of whether one of<br/>the notes is octave-equivalent to the fundamental or not.</p><p>Try to listen to the two intervals objectively and tell me you don&apos;t think<br/>one blends a lot more smoothly. Also include 16/15 and 6/5 in your<br/>comparisons.</p><p>&gt;Consider the chords - maj7 and 6. They certaintly have different flavors,<br/>&gt;but one is not more dissonant than the other.</p><p>That&apos;s a different issue. I actually do tend to agree with this assessment<br/>of these tetrads -- look at these chords on the triangular lattice:</p><p>Major 7:</p><p>     5/4------15/8<br/>     / \       /<br/>    /   \     /<br/>   /     \   /<br/>  /       \ /<br/>1/1-------3/2</p><p>6:</p><p>5/3-------5/4<br/>  \       / \<br/>   \     /   \<br/>    \   /     \<br/>     \ /       \<br/>     1/1-------3/2</p><p>They are about equally compact on the lattice, which reflects their similar<br/>degree of dissonance. However, observe that 5/3 to 1/1 is shorter than 15/8<br/>to 1/1. That reflects the relative dissonance of these dyads, while the<br/>rectangular lattice would lead you to believe that these dyads are equally<br/>consonant.</p><p>&gt;Besides, I designed my system<br/>&gt;not to be so much a measure of consonance as a measure of how much<br/>&gt;modulation one would need to do to &quot;get there&quot;.</p><p>So you believe that modulating by a major third is a &quot;shorter distance&quot; than<br/>modulating by a minor third? I certainly don&apos;t find that at all, especially<br/>when the music has a diatonic basis, in which case minor third modulations<br/>are particularly easy to hear.</p></div>
