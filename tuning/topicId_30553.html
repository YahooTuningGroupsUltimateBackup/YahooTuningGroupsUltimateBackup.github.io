I Can only imagine<br/>you<br/>&gt; see to as my rejection of 24<br/>&gt; &gt; Et in its use in Mediterranean pop music. I can only say that this<br/>&gt; viewpoint is almost universally<br/>&gt; &gt; supported by the finer of Persian And mid east musicians<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can only say that the finer of middle-eastern musicians I&apos;ve<br/>spoken<br/>&gt; to, corresponded with, and played music with, use a tuning far<br/>closer<br/>&gt; to 24-tET than to the 17-tone medieval Arabic tuning to which Wilson<br/>&gt; likes to refer.

This is one of the first chunks of the<br/>lattice<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that one sees when expanding one&apos;s scope in the lattice (which<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; basically what many of us theorists are engaged in.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; yet it has never been mentioned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One could mention each stage in the expansion process and go on<br/>&gt; forever. More interesting is to note where the near equivalencies<br/>&gt; occur, as these allow you to generate CS scales or periodicity<br/>blocks<br/>&gt; or whatever you want to call them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or maybe they are quite the same but you have a craw in your<br/>side<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that prevents you from seeing alternative approaches coming from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; outside your &quot;school&quot; as valuable.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What alternative is being presented except alot of complex numbers<br/>&gt; that has no relations to music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where do you see this? If that&apos;s all you see, perhaps you should<br/>step<br/>&gt; back and try to understand the musical meaning of what&apos;s being<br/>&gt; presented.
