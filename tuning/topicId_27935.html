I don&apos;t know if someone else have used them.</p><p>Every interval is composed by some of these intervals by multiplication and dividing, like:<br/> 28/27 = 7/6 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/1 ( composed by 7/6 &amp; 3/2 &amp; 2/1 )<br/>We can also compose this interval as:<br/>28/27 = 7/6 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/1 * 11/10 * 10/11</p><p>But since 11/10 &amp; 10/11 are opposed and 11/10 * 10/11 =1 then we omit them.<br/>When you omit such opposed intervals, every interval is composed by prime intervals in just one way.<br/>e.g. 9/8 = 3/2 * 3/2 * 1/2, you cannot use another prime intervals to compose 9/8!</p><p>All intervals in the Byzantine scales are composed by some of theses prime intervals: 2/1, 3/2, 5/4, 7/6<br/>I will shorten and say if the measurements of these intervals are accurate then everything is OK.</p><p>But they must be accurate also relative to the comma we are using, I mean:<br/>3.2 + 4.2 = 7.4 in the 36 per octave is better than<br/>6.4 + 8.4 = 14.8 in the 72 per octave</p><p>because approximately:<br/>3 + 4 = 7</p><p>when:<br/>6 + 8 ?= 15</p><p>So, what is the number between 1! and 300, which gives accurate measurements to these prime numbers in cents and relative to the comma we use?<br/>In fact no one does! 171 and 212 are somehow good but unfortunately not good enough</p><p>But 53 is a noticeable number because it is small and gives accurate measurements for 5/4 &amp; 3/2 but not for 7/6:</p><p>Interval    in the 53 per octave<br/>2/1         53<br/>3/2         31.003<br/>5/4         17.062<br/>7/6         11.787 ( 12 - 0.213 )</p><p>So what, big deal, we put a symbol on 12 as (,) to notice that the 7/6 measurement is smaller a bit than 12 and let&apos;s see what will happen.</p><p>For instance 28/27 will be:<br/>7/6 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/1 = 28/27<br/>12, - 31 - 31 + 53 = 3,</p><p>We consider (,) as a little bit bigger than a negative quarter of the comma we are using, and (&apos;) as a little bit bigger than a positive quarter of the comma we are using</p><p>When we add a number with (,) we add (,) to the result - when we subtract a number with (,) we add (&apos;)<br/>When adding two numbers with (,) we add (,,) to the result and when we subtract two numbers with (,) we add (&apos;&apos;) to the result<br/>and so on.</p><p>The Byzantine scale will be:</p><p>21/20 50/49 21/20 64/63 49/48 36/35 25/24 36/35 49/48 64/63 21/20 50/49 21/20 21/20 50/49 21/20 64/63 49/48 36/35 25/24 36/35 49/48 64/63</p><p>4,    1&apos;&apos;    4,    1&apos;    2,,    2&apos;    3    2&apos;    2,,    1&apos;    4,    1&apos;&apos;    4,    4,    1&apos;&apos;    4,    1&apos;    2,,    2&apos;    3    2&apos;    2,,    1&apos;</p><p>The diatonic scale will be:</p><p>9    8    5    9    9    8    5</p><p>It is a complicated method for musicologists, but it is very easy to musicians and I think it is very useful because:<br/>  1.. It is OK 100% with the three considerations above. ( e.g. 50/49 &amp; 49/48 are presented differently : 1&apos;&apos; &amp; 2,, )<br/>  2.. They are small and easy to remember numbers<br/>  3.. The diatonic scale has no (,) and no (&apos;), why? because it is composed by only 2/1 &amp; 3/2 &amp; 5/4<br/>  Every scale composed with only these prime intervals has no (&apos;) and (,) and is joyful!<br/>  Every one composed with 7/6 has (&apos;) or (,) and also it is somehow sad! So (,)s are meaningful!<br/>  4.. If you want mathematical accuracy ( if you want to play this scale ) consider (&apos;) as positive quarter of the comma and (,) as negative quarter of the comma, you will get the 212 per octave which is very accurate, and you will get this without any need to remember other numbers.<br/>This method is good for Byzantine scales and for all scales composed by 2/1 3/2 5/4 7/6 but not for others</p><p>Rami Vitale</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2001 11:59:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Rami Vitale&quot; &lt;alfred1@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Rami Vitale wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Look to these two tetrachords:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 15/14 7/6 16/15<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 16/15 7/6 15/14<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Although they are somehow similar, but every one of them has a<br/>special independent taste.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Well 15:14 * 7:6  = 5/4, which is a note you can harmonically lock<br/>into against the drone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;With 16:15 as the bottom interval, you don&apos;t get that 5/4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But that doesn&apos;t prove anything.

The<br/>&gt; transformation matrix is therefore upper triangular with ones along<br/>&gt; the diagonal, and hence is unimodular; and so the transformation is<br/>&gt; invertible.</p><p>Thank you a lot for doing this, I must rerereread to understand it clearly.</p><p>&gt; &gt; All intervals in the Byzantine scales are composed by some of<br/>&gt; theses prime intervals: 2/1, 3/2, 5/4, 7/6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This simply says they are JI scales in the 7-limit. That entails that<br/>&gt; the 171 division will work very, very well for your purposes!<br/>&gt; &gt; So, what is the number between 1! and 300, which gives accurate<br/>&gt; measurements to these prime numbers in cents and relative to the<br/>&gt; comma we use?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 171.</p><p>What does JI scales in the 7-limit means? I think sombody here must lead me<br/>to a dictionary for tuning terms.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In fact no one does! 171 and 212 are somehow good but unfortunately<br/>&gt; not good enough<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect 171 is much, much better than you are giving it credit for<br/>&gt; being.</p><p>OK OK! see the next message...</p><p>Rami</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2001 1:37:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Rami Vitale&quot; &lt;alfred1@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think 171-tET will turn out to be just wonderful for your<br/>purposes<br/>&gt; &gt; once you get your arithmetic right. :) It&apos;s consistent in the 7-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit, at LEVEL 8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once again what does 7-limit at LEVEL 8 means?</p><p>The basic 7-limit consonances are 1:1, 8:7, 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 7:5,<br/>and their octave inversions and extensions. Consistency at level 8<br/>means that you can combine eight of these intervals and the result<br/>will always agree between JI and 171-tET. For your purposes, level 3<br/>or 4 would probably be sufficient.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 171-tET is good, accurate, it presents 50/49 &amp; 49/48 equaly but it<br/>is not a<br/>&gt; big deal.</p><p>I hope not! The difference, 2401:2400, is only 0.7 cent.</p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>9/10/2001 1:39:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Rami Vitale&quot; &lt;alfred1@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think sombody here must lead me<br/>&gt; to a dictionary for tuning terms.</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/</a></p></div>
