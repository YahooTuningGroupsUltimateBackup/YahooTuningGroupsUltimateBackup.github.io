Is this the case?<br/>&gt;If so, how can this be reconciled with the theoretical cents values<br/>&gt;you posted based on the 1/9-schisma-tempered-fifth generator?</p><p>Dinarra is  neither the 53 root of 2 nor the 54 of two. It&apos;s ratios are<br/>defined, as  you said, raising the fifth, narrowed in one Omega,<br/>from -26 to +26.<br/>I call Omega the 1/9 of a schisma.<br/>All the frets of the guitar must be pulled out and  thrown away before putting the new Dinarra<br/>frets.<br/>All the grooves must be filled with a paste made with glue and sawdust, although<br/>there may be other more modern gluing pastes, and left to dry.<br/>Sometimes an old groove is  very close to the one that must be cut. In this case it&apos;s  necessary to<br/>fill it with a thin piece of hard wood with a previous layer of glue and  placed in the old groove<br/>by pressure. Once it has dried  up completely  it must be sandpapered, etc., and  then the<br/>fretboard  is  ready to cut the new grooves.</p><p>Greetings<br/>Eduardo</p></div><h3><a id=27293 href="#27293">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2001 12:34:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi &lt;ESABAT@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; All the frets of the guitar must be pulled out and  thrown away<br/>before putting the new Dinarra<br/>&gt; frets.<br/>&gt; All the grooves must be filled with a paste made with glue and<br/>sawdust, although<br/>&gt; there may be other more modern gluing pastes, and left to dry.<br/>&gt; Sometimes an old groove is  very close to the one that must be cut.<br/>In this case it&apos;s  necessary to<br/>&gt; fill it with a thin piece of hard wood with a previous layer of<br/>glue and  placed in the old groove<br/>&gt; by pressure.
