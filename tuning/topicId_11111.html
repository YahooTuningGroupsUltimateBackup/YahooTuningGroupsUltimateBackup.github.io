I<br/>was actually trying to figure it out using my copy of the &quot;Monzo Tome,&quot;<br/>which still shows 6PM as the starting point...</p><p>However, there didn&apos;t seem to be anywhere in either the book or your<br/>website which clearly explained what you were trying to do and the<br/>&quot;inclusive&quot; nature of the plotting.  Maybe I&apos;m missing something,<br/>somewhere... but the list post seemed to do it best.</p><p>More when I digest it a little more [if I GET my digest!]</p><p>_____________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
