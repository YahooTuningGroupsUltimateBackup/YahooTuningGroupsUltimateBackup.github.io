I would<br/>say at LEAST HALF of all the acts, maybe more.  None of the<br/>performers even had instruments, not even guitars (undoubtedly they<br/>didn&apos;t play anything), but just mics.  It made Rod Stewart look like<br/>the height of traditionalism (he included violins in his act...)</p><p>This is not to disparage this kind of urban poetry in any way, but<br/>that this &quot;music&quot; was really not much about *pitch* at all... but<br/>only about *rhythm...*</p><p>What pitches there *were* were certainly microtonal, hence the<br/>appropriateness for this list...</p><p>J.
