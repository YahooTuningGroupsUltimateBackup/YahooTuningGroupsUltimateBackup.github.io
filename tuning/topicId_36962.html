I thought that beating did occur on the ear<br/>&gt; drum and did not depend on spectral resolution of the basilar<br/>membrane.</p><p>my pleasure:<br/>Beating does occur in the air. Back to the basic, beating is based on<br/>the<br/>exact trigonometric equation:</p><p>sin( F1*t ) + sin( F2*t ) = 2 * sin( (F1+F2)*t/2 ) * cos( (F1-F2)*t/2<br/>).</p><p>(I leave appart the 2*pi factor that is not necessary for the<br/>explanation) Mathematically a sum of two sines with different<br/>frequencies equate a sine with a frequency which is the average<br/>between F1 and F2, but multiplied by a modulating enveloppe that has<br/>frequency equating the difference between F1 and F2. If you record the<br/>air pressure in the air (i.e. using a microphone) and trace the curve,<br/>you will clearly see the beating.</p><p>What may be difficult to understand is that even though, the right and<br/>the left forms are equivalent, the time-&gt;frequency domain<br/>transformation that occurs in the cochlea (or in a Fourier transform)<br/>&quot;select&quot; the left form. In other words, for any arbitrary signal, the<br/>effect of the time-&gt;frequency transform is to decompose it into a sum<br/>of sinus (or cosines), not a product or other combinaison of<br/>trigonometric function.</p><p>The cochlea is a very cleverly designed device that transforms the<br/>incomming time-domain waves into a set of stationnary waves with<br/>maximum amplitudes on points of the basiliary membrane mapping the<br/>frequency domain in a fairly linear way.</p><p>The amplitude of the stationnary waves obviously moves over time so<br/>that we perceive the time evolution of the sound. Also the auditory<br/>integrate information over a limited period of time that is analogous<br/>to the &quot;sliding analysis window&quot; used in (digital) signal window.</p><p>As I explained in a previous post, if the sliding window is long<br/>enough wrt to F2-F1, F1 and F2 are resolved as individual tones and<br/>the average energy in the window do not vary much over time: no beat.<br/>If the sliding window is short wrt to F2-F1 (or if the difference<br/>between F1 and F2 is small), the amount of energy in the window vary<br/>over time, the beat is perceived as a time domain phenomena.</p><p>But the auditory system is resourcefull and is capable of performing<br/>simultaneously analysis in various domain and at various level of<br/>complexity. People working on computer speech recognition painfully<br/>know that the humain brain is unmatched to recognize and analyse<br/>simultaneously the pitch, the phonemes, the syllabe, the words, the<br/>sentences, the semantical content and the emotional state of the<br/>locutor, even in extremely noisy environment: if information is<br/>missing at any level, the gaps are filled with information comming<br/>from many other places (knowledge of the language, of the semantical<br/>context, phrasing habit of the locutor, name it). Brain is magic to<br/>fill-in the blanks.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;as for roughness, read this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/roughness.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/roughness.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt; Rapid means that, to be perceived as roughness, the time interval<br/>&gt; between successive events must be less than about 30 ms.</p><p>AND TO THE POINT!!!</p><p>We can reasonnably assume that the auditory system performs its<br/>primary analysis simultaneously with many &quot;window size&quot;. There is not<br/>a fixed frequency or duration where, &quot;click&quot;,  the brain switch from<br/>one analysis mode to the other (discrete event to tone, time to<br/>frequency etc.). So IMHU, beat and roughness (at least wrt to<br/>intonation) are basically the same, but the beat is clearly<br/>time-domain, while the roughness is in the twilight zone where various<br/>analysis modes cooperate in the auditory system. 30 ms is only a<br/>figure for a point somewhere in the middle of this zone.</p><p>END OF THE POINT</p><p>Another example of the capability to fill the blank is the &quot;virtual<br/>pitch&quot;. This is well known, that in the traditional telephone bandwith<br/>(300Hz-3300Hz) male voice pitch is totally absent (or was, telephone<br/>quality has made some progress). It seems that whenever there are few<br/>frequency evenly distributed with a missing root, the brain &quot;invent&quot;<br/>it. In a way it is like visual illusion where we complete the contour<br/>of familiar shapes. That may occur at a more or less upstream point of<br/>the auditory system not as a non-linear phenomena occuring in the<br/>middle ear or in the cochlea.</p><p>Am I correct to assume that &quot;virtual pitch&quot; and &quot;difference tone&quot; is<br/>the same thing?</p><p>Bob:<br/>&gt; &gt;minimizing roughness to achieve simple JI ratios is exactly the<br/>same<br/>&gt; &gt;thing as minimizing beating to achieve the same simple JI ratios.<br/>&gt; /.../<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Roughness does occur between pure tones, also.</p><p>I suspect that roughness between pure tones can only be perceived by<br/>highly sophisticated and educated ears (I was quite lousy to hear any<br/>diffrences between the &quot;jerries&quot; files) ;-)</p><p>&gt; &gt;yes, but only when they&apos;re less than a minor third apart (or<br/>further<br/>&gt; &gt;in the bass register).</p><p>Carl:<br/>&gt; Right, and when do they start beating?</p><p>That was, in a way, my question when I asked:</p><p>Francois previously:<br/>&gt; By the way, is there a perception of beat when using pure sine tones<br/>with<br/>&gt; ratio slightly off 1:2, 2:3 and so on? If so that would be a good<br/>argument<br/>&gt; in favor of difference tone.</p><p>I mean difference tone for JI tuning of course</p><p>SO....<br/>If roughness and beat are the same, using one ore the other for JI a<br/>cappella tuning is the same. My problem is that if it is so, I do not<br/>understand how singers can use them for ratio above 6:5, because as<br/>far as I can explore actual voice recording, upper frequencies (let<br/>say above 5-6th harmonics) are not very accurate and can probably not<br/>provide reliable beat (or roughness). Or perhaps I work only with bad<br/>recordings? Or perhaps what is perceived of the singer own voice is<br/>more reliable than what is picked up by the microphone?</p><p>or roughness is something else than beat, or the mechanism for a<br/>capella JI tuning is something else (memory of intervall?)</p><p>Yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2002 12:58:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt;beating is what results from these very limitations, and does not<br/>&gt;  &gt;occur &quot;in the air&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Care to explain how?

Vos is a researcher who got this<br/>result, according to Paul.  other experiments have found that<br/>listeners<br/>&gt; can&apos;t pick them out (Plomp &amp; Levelt, I think).</p><p>neither experiment concerned &quot;picking them out&quot;. but you&apos;re right,<br/>vos found &quot;purity maxima&quot; for pure tones at 2:3 and 4:5, while plomp<br/>and levelt didn&apos;t find &quot;roughness minima&quot; for pure tones at these<br/>ratios. perhaps differing experimental conditions, particularly<br/>different amplitude levels (which have a non-linear impact on the<br/>amplitudes of the combinational tones) explain why the results were<br/>different.</p><p>&gt; () According to Paul there&apos;s something called 2nd-order beating.<br/>&gt; What&apos;s that?</p><p>it&apos;s a sort of beating which is due to higher-level neural processing<br/>in the brain (and is thus perceptible for two tones presented<br/>separately to the ears), rather than the usual critical-band-induced<br/>mechanism within each ear. check out roederer&apos;s introductory book, if<br/>at all possible -- then follow up with the references roederer<br/>provides, if you&apos;re interested . . .</p><p>&gt;  &gt; Jon:<br/>&gt;  &gt;Could anyone post the universally agreed upon definitions of both<br/>&gt;  &gt;beating and roughness?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anybody?</p><p>i&apos;ll look into it!</p><p>&gt; If roughness really is high-frequency beating, I was wrong.  But I<br/>&gt; was right that difference tones aren&apos;t high-frequency beating (I<br/>&gt; think).</p><p>yes, you&apos;re right. i&apos;ve been discussing this with bob offline, and he<br/>agrees that the two aren&apos;t the same thing, though he&apos;s never heard<br/>the latter without also hearing the former. the non-linearities that<br/>create difference tones are inescapable, in his view. i noted to him<br/>that, according to the research i perused, the only combinational<br/>tone that does not rapidly vanish in amplitude for decreasing input<br/>levels, is the cubic 2a-b combinational tone, but this was for some<br/>particular range of intervals, and for sine tones rather than the<br/>harmonic-rich human voices bob is used to working with.</p></div>
