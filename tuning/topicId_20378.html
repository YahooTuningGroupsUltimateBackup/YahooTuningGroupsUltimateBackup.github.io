The plan is to<br/>&gt; record the Li Po when we get back.</p><p>Well, I&apos;m glad you weren&apos;t distracted by that little scuffle.  Also that<br/>you detected enthusiasm, because you got a very hostile response where I<br/>was sitting, at least for the songs.  In particular, the man sitting just<br/>down from me was making generally insulting remarks about you, the music<br/>and those of us who liked it.  As he was distracting me from the music, I<br/>told him in no uncertain terms to keep quiet.  He avoided my suggestion<br/>and so, not being blessed with diplomacy, I hit him.  I&apos;m not sure what he<br/>said after that, but I remember being very mad at him, so I hit him a few<br/>more times.  Then somebody came and sat between us, and eventually I got<br/>moved to a different seat.  Fortunately, they did let me stay for the rest<br/>of the concert, and the audience in my new location received it with the<br/>silence customary at such events.  So the moral of the story is that<br/>violence can solve your problems, I suppose.</p><p>I still wasn&apos;t in the right mood to take in the music for the first<br/>half, but it did sound good.</p><p>The Gesualdo was the highlight.  It didn&apos;t really fit the images, but was<br/>well sung.  The harmony came through well, although there were a few of<br/>the standard choral mistuned unisons.  Did you ask the group how the<br/>approached intonation?</p><p>Later on in my travels, I gained entry to the British Library and looked<br/>through an edition of Vicentino&apos;s music.  He was fairly progressive, but<br/>not as much as in his theories.  Most pieces fit 12 notes, I don&apos;t think<br/>any more than 13.  There&apos;s one interesting progression:</p><p>G  G   B   D<br/>D  Eb  G#  A<br/>   G<br/>   Bb  E   A<br/>G  Eb  E   D</p><p>Root progression by a chromatic semitone, one voice moving by an augmented<br/>third and only one voice moving by 5-limit interval to balance it.  Fairly<br/>unconventional, but as much so as it gets.  Presumably, he had to keep the<br/>harmony simple enough to be sung, not being rich and powerful enough to<br/>keep and train his own musicians.  No pieces were included for his<br/>archicembalo.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t allowed to make any photocopies, as the modern edition is still<br/>in copyright.</p><p>              Graham</p><p>(back home after a good night&apos;s sleep)</p></div><h3><a id=20405 href="#20405">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2001 6:00:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20378.html#20401">/tuning/topicId_20378.html#20401</a></p><p>&gt; Johnny Reinhard wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Barbican concert went well &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I&apos;m glad you weren&apos;t distracted by that little scuffle.<br/>&gt; Also that you detected enthusiasm, because you got a very<br/>&gt; hostile response where I was sitting, at least for the songs.<br/>&gt; In particular, the man sitting just down from me was making<br/>&gt; generally insulting remarks about you, the music and those of<br/>&gt; us who liked it.

Although at least I expected the introduction to mention<br/>the absence of a whole motet.  I&apos;m also suspicious that it includes only<br/>books 1 and 5 of madrigals.  What&apos;s going on there?</p><p>&gt; Both Vicentino&apos;s treatise and the testimony of a contemporary musician<br/>&gt; such as Vincenzo Galilei indicate that the archicembalo was used as a<br/>&gt; standard in training singers to sing in the enharmonic genus, so that<br/>&gt; pieces of this kind might have a rather specialized audience,<br/>&gt; especially in an era when many madrigal collections were aimed at<br/>&gt; music lovers who would themselves be the performers.</p><p>It&apos;s becoming apparent to me that chromaticism/microtonality was very much<br/>an economic matter at that time.  Gesualdo used a greater range of<br/>accidentals than other composers not only because he had more adventurous<br/>tastes but because he could take the time to train his musicians to sing<br/>them.  And he subsidise the eventual publication.</p><p>I don&apos;t know much of Vicentino&apos;s biography, but it seems he had a high-up<br/>job with the resources at his disposal to build these instruments.  And<br/>nobody without those instruments could perform music written for them.  As<br/>for the archicembalo&apos;s fate, we have Watkins&apos; salutary &quot;account of<br/>Bottrigari, who states the great number of strings in this instrument made<br/>it very difficult to tune as well as to play.  He adds that, because of<br/>this difficulty, most skilful players seldom cared to meddle with it,<br/>although Luzzachi knew and understood it and was able to play upon it with<br/>amazing skill.&quot;  [p.54 of Watkins&apos; Gesualdo biography, (2nd edition 1991)]</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=20463 href="#20463">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/27/2001 9:07:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 3/26/01 5:14:46 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t vouch for your accuracy, although a spectroscope could.
