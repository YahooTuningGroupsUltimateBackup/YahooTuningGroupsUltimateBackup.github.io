So if we model a<br/>person as a Turing machine, which takes in a piece of music as input<br/>and either runs forever if it &quot;likes it,&quot; or halts if it &quot;doesn&apos;t like<br/>it,&quot; we already know that a UTM won&apos;t be able to figure out for an<br/>arbitrary person and an arbitrary song as input if the program will<br/>like or halt. To &quot;prove&quot; this, all you have to do is work up the usual<br/>proof of the Church-Turing thesis, except instead of introducing a<br/>recursive program that deliberately doesn&apos;t do whatever the UTM says,<br/>use flowery language to describe it like a snooty artist type who<br/>deliberately doesn&apos;t like whatever a perfect theory of music says he&apos;s<br/>supposed to like. Then come up with a clever statement that the<br/>UTM/perfect theory of music will always be wrong about. (I can work<br/>this out formally if people are interested.)</p><p>In real life, human behavior probably isn&apos;t best modeled as a Turing<br/>machine. This is why I talked about nondeterministic Turing machines<br/>which have an x% chance of responding one way to some input, and a y%<br/>chance of responding another way to the same input, etc. And that&apos;s<br/>also why I talked about considering a parallel computation model. And<br/>if that&apos;s still not human enough, you can keep humanizing the system<br/>more and more, using things like neural networks or even models that<br/>haven&apos;t been invented yet.</p><p>So no matter how I decide to model &quot;a person,&quot; you could always object<br/>that this model is still too rigid and not human enough.</p><p>However, this is the total opposite of what you&apos;d need to say to prove<br/>that my point doesn&apos;t apply. A perfect theory of music which can run<br/>on some computer would be a Turing machine. Assume we&apos;re stupidly<br/>modeling a human as another Turing machine. If even under these<br/>conditions there are limits on what one Turing machine can predict<br/>about another, then by instead using more complex computing models to<br/>model human beings, especially nondeterministic ones, it&apos;s likely that<br/>these limits are increased, or at least that there are still limits at<br/>all to know about.</p><p>For my point about hard limits on what music theory can accomplish to<br/>not apply at all, you&apos;d have to argue that not only is a Turing<br/>machine too rigid to represent human behavior, but that some better<br/>model exists for which, counterintuitively, every decision problem you<br/>can formulate about its behavior in response to some arbitrary input<br/>is Turing computable.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103731 href="#103731">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2012 2:55:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Feb 16, 2012 at 5:00 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now that we&apos;re on the same page about what&apos;s being said, does anyone know<br/>&gt; &gt; how does music works?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so now that we&apos;re on the same page - Cameron, here&apos;s a question<br/>&gt; for you.

There are any number of maqam ajnas which can (and often are) written very simplistically, C-D-E-F for example, but for who knows how many people (undoubtedly many millions, perhaps a billion or more?) are distinguished by microtonal variation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those who perceive such things and think in terms of things like mood, what is harmonically mundane when scanned in terms of notes rather than sounds may not be mundane at all.</p><p>I agree, that intonation of categories can be used to transmit<br/>information. One can find examples of this even in the fact that some<br/>clever people like to use 7/6 and 6/5 as minor thirds of subtly<br/>varying moods.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know exactly what this conceptual organization, but it seems<br/>&gt; &gt; to have to do with things like<br/>&gt; &gt; - &quot;Roots&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; - &quot;Tonal centers&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; - The &quot;mode&quot; in the background at any point<br/>&gt; &gt; - The &quot;implied chords&quot; that a string of notes or dyads causes you to imagine<br/>&gt; &gt; - Chord progressions, for which we barely have any adequate theory at all<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll try to post a reply to this asap, with a musical example.</p><p>Yay</p><p>&gt; &gt; So I think that when you say that &quot;intonation is intonation OF<br/>&gt; &gt; ________&quot;, you&apos;re talking about things like the above, or rather a<br/>&gt; &gt; foundational concept which leads to all of those things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes that&apos;s the traditional concept of &quot;just intonation&quot;.

This is simply lack of knowledge- that 7:4 is traditionally considered an intonation of the augmented sixth is not something I &quot;made up&quot;. But is this a holdover from 1/4-comma meantone, in which the augmented sixth is a well approximated 7:4, or something with a strong psychoacoustic base, as has been claimed by some through the last few centuries? For those who think this is the case, barbershop cadences must be distinct indeed.</p><p>So, this little piece ends on a harmonically tuned &quot;I9&quot;. Does it &quot;want&quot; to then resolve to &quot;fa&quot;? To my ears, &quot;sort of&quot;.</p><p>The question though is whether this piece really is in 11-limit Just Intonation, or is it in an 11-limit rational intervallic structure. If it is in 11-limit JI, we must be able to say what it is that is being Justly intoned. Can you hear a scale in this piece?</p><p>It was certainly not conceived with a scale in mind. The structure is simple: the highest tone throughout, marked by a bell, starts alone, then is harmonized as if it were an 11th partial, a 9th partial, a 7th partial, so on down to the last chord in which it is the fundamental. So the title Falling While Standing Still is descriptive.</p><p>I tried as much as possible to make full 4:5:6:7.9:11 chords, with some passing alterations using 5:6 at the bottom to keep it moving. Even with 29 discrete pitches in the octave, the pedal as the 9th partial is only touched upon and not fleshed out, I figured that&apos;s the one that can be slighted while maintaining the &quot;falling&quot;.</p><p>Now, Mike- do you hear the &quot;melting together&quot;? Do you hear the portamento, or swooning, or whatever you&apos;d like to call it, effects? At about 19-22 seconds for example. There is no portamento, all pitches are &quot;straight&quot;, digital synthesizer straight.</p></div><h3><a id=103757 href="#103757">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2012 2:30:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I need a word to use to talk to my friends about music that can&apos;t be played on their piano<br/>&gt; &gt; and doesn&apos;t use the notes A, A#, B, C, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What am I supposed to say now, if not &quot;xenharmonic&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did they understand &quot;xenharmonic&quot; without a lengthy explanation of the origins and meaning of the word?</p><p>Yes - they only needed a brief definition.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Microtonal&quot; is the only word I know of that gets the point across that &quot;this music is not in standard 12-tone equal temperament&quot; without a lengthy explanation, even though it has connotations of a focus on &quot;small intervals&quot; (usually quarter-tones).

I prefer &quot;microtonal&quot; a thousand times over, because it&apos;s no more flawed than &quot;xenharmonic&quot; and is already understood by pretty much everybody that I&apos;d want to talk to about the subject.  That, and it&apos;s easier to spell, easier to pronounce, and easier to modify (I like the sound of &quot;microtonalist&quot;, &quot;microtonally&quot;, &quot;microtonality&quot;, etc. much better than &quot;xenharmonist&quot;, &quot;xenharmonically&quot;, &quot;xenharmony&quot;, etc.).</p><p>&gt; None of this bothers me at all. Like most other English words, it doesn&apos;t have a<br/>&gt; mathematically precise meaning, which is fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other words I mentioned like &quot;polyrhythmic&quot; don&apos;t have precise meanings either.<br/>&gt; You&apos;re not going to get anywhere near 100% agreement on whether every specific piece &gt; is or is not polyrhythmic. Does that mean it&apos;s a stupid word and should be abolished?<br/>&gt; No, because it labels a (vague) concept that people want to talk about.

It really wouldn&apos;t take much.  Just cut out the &quot;doesn&apos;t sound like 12-TET&quot; and replace it with &quot;is not composed for 12-TET&quot;.  No room for debate there, except in matters of historical accuracy.  Sure, that lets in some well-temperaments and meantone and all that, but they&apos;re *already* admitted under the previous definition, as long as someone can hear that they don&apos;t sound like 12-TET.  This definition allows the composer&apos;s intent to be the deciding factor.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=103768 href="#103768">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2012 2:59:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Who is defining &quot;xenharmonic&quot; that way?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The man who coined the term!  &quot;This writer has proposed the term xenharmonic for music, melodies, scales, harmonies, instruments, and tuning-systems which do not sound like the 12-tone-equal temperament.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, what does it mean to not sound like 12-tone equal temperament?  Haven&apos;t we had enough debates about this on XA to make it obvious that it&apos;s far from easy to reach consensus on that?  There are some people who think that meantone doesn&apos;t sound like 12-tone equal temperament.  There are others that think anything accurate in the 5-limit *does* sound like 12-tone equal temperament.  Some might even say that accurate 7-limit music sounds like 12-TET--or is barbershop music xenharmonic?  What about a circulating 12-note temperament where all the major 3rds are 5/4, 9/7, or 14/11, and all the minors 6/5, 7/6, or 13/11?  Are Johnny Reinhard&apos;s overtone-series versions of classical pieces xenharmonic?  What about 7-limit pieces in Injera or Pajara, two temperaments supported by 12-TET but not well-tuned in it?  How about ripple[12]?  Diminished[12] in 16-ED2, or augmented[12] in 15-ED2?  What about diminished[12] in 28-ED2, or augmented[12] in 27-ED2?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally, I don&apos;t know that I could confidently decide any of these cases.  Part of me is not comfortable calling them xenharmonic, and part of me insists upon it.  Therefore I think it sucks as a term for describing music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs</p><p>As one who has read most of Ivor Darreg&apos;s writings, has corresponded with him numerous times, and has spoken with him face-to-face on more than a few occasions, I am probably as qualified as anyone to clarify the meaning of the term &quot;xenharmonic&quot; as he intended it to be used.</p><p>As I understand it, the term applies to any tuning (just, tempered, or whatever) that sounds significantly different from 12-equal.  In practical terms this means that if you play an appropriate musical passage successively in 12-equal and tuning X (in unspecified order), if it&apos;s possible to distinguish one from the other by ear, then tuning X is xenharmonic.  By &quot;appropriate musical passage&quot;, I mean one that&apos;s not contrived to hide the differences, so you would not want to use a single melodic line consisting of only those intervals which differ by the least amount in the two tunings, but rather something with a harmonic texture that contains &quot;usable&quot; intervals that differ the most between tunings.  (By &quot;usable&quot;, I&apos;m excluding the condition that &quot;wolf&quot; intervals or intervals a comma false be present in the tuning X example in cases where a composer or performer would be expected to avoid such intervals in an actual composition or performance.)</p><p>I don&apos;t make it a condition that *everybody* can tell the difference, only that the majority of those on a panel of educated listeners be able to identify correctly which one is 12-equal and which is tuning X.</p><p>Of course, it goes without saying that if tuning X is so drastically different from 12-equal that it&apos;s impossible to play a tuning X passage in 12-equal, then tuning X is clearly xenharmonic.</p><p>The term was coined because most of the tunings being used by those in the 1970&apos;s xenharmonic movement contained strange intervals that were foreign to 12-equal, and the already-existing term &quot;microtonal&quot; didn&apos;t cover tunings like 5-equal and 7-equal.  Nevertheless, a xenharmonic tuning need not be strange- or foreign-sounding to be included under the label &quot;xenharmonic&quot;, because then there would be the problem of deciding whether a given tuning would be strange enough to qualify.</p><p>Igs, with this explanation I believe that most of the examples you gave above (including barbershop and 1/4-comma meantone) are indeed xenharmonic.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=103770 href="#103770">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2012 3:53:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Feb 20, 2012 at 4:46 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Huh?

I note that this sort of thing is<br/>undeterred by things like passing tones and chromatic notes and so on.</p><p>It may be that psychoacoustics has some kind of basic &quot;imprinting&quot;<br/>effect in the sort of structures that you recognize, which could<br/>explain some of the recent confusion with Gene&apos;s example. I don&apos;t<br/>really know. But I do think that there&apos;s a strong reification<br/>component to this aspect of musical perception, and that it&apos;s learned,<br/>and that it might be the same sort of process that allows one to reify<br/>in &quot;roots&quot; and &quot;tonal centers&quot; and so on in heirarchical fashion<br/>(which was my whole spiel about Schenkerian analysis).</p><p>&gt; But editing recordings, even from not terribly<br/>&gt; lively acoustic spaces, will show you that the horizontal carries literally,<br/>&gt; not just in perception, further than you might think.</p><p>If you&apos;re talking about things like the impulse response of the room,<br/>then I&apos;d say that I don&apos;t think that&apos;s terribly important in<br/>establishing the affect of chords, at least not to a trained listener,<br/>because I tend to hear chord progressions just fine even if played on<br/>a monophonic instrument with sawtooth waves and no reverb.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103788 href="#103788">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2012 2:52:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Tue, Feb 21, 2012 at 12:10 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh but I did not say they are fundamentally different- I said that are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; traditionally considered fundamentally different.

Maybe a few<br/>differ. I&apos;m not sure what sort of ear training might separate the two.</p><p>Now: in as much as the &quot;intonation is intonation of ________&quot; paradigm<br/>is concerned, consider quasi-equal scales. When you listen to a<br/>quasi-equal scale like tetracot[7], even though you can obviously tell<br/>apart things like the 3/2 fifth and the sharp 3/2 fifth, distinctions<br/>sometimes tend to blur together when you&apos;re playing melody or what<br/>have you. It requires a bit of training to be able to tell apart<br/>nearly ambiguous intervals in quasi-equal scales. (And if you don&apos;t<br/>agree, just keep tuning the scale closer and closer to equal until you<br/>do agree.)</p><p>Meantone[12] in quarter-comma, fifth-comma, sixth-comma meantone is<br/>pretty quasi-equal, compared to something like meantone[7] in those<br/>tunings, or compared to meantone[12] in 26-EDO, or what have you.<br/>Leopold Mozart had to teach his students to distinguish between the<br/>two sizes of semitone,<br/>which indicates to me that this sense of quasi-equalness is somewhat<br/>natural to experience - after all, intervals that differ by diesis<br/>really are smaller than those that differ by chroma and so on. I don&apos;t<br/>doubt that training can change this, or that Gesualdo didn&apos;t hear this<br/>differently, only that it&apos;s natural in some sense to hear those two<br/>types of half steps as being &quot;different types of the same thing,&quot; at<br/>least at first.</p><p>So my question is, do you think that the average listener in the<br/>meantone era - not Scarlatti, not Gesualdo, but the average listener -<br/>heard the two half steps, the two minor thirds, the two whatevers as<br/>being totally different intervals with different feelings and<br/>different schematic meanings and so on? Or do you think they heard<br/>them tending to blend together, and distinguishing them primarily in<br/>an intonational sense as variants of the same thing?</p><p>I think there&apos;s some reason to consider the latter view, given the<br/>trend towards well-temperament and equal-temperament later, and that<br/>the reason typically given for this trend was that &quot;people didn&apos;t like<br/>that all chords were playable in all keys.&quot;</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103793 href="#103793">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2012 11:26:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Feb 21, 2012 at 11:51 AM, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; So no, I don&apos;t think even what I called &quot;phenomena&quot; are all that<br/>&gt; &gt; objective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By &quot;objective&quot;, I don&apos;t mean subject-independent, I just mean &quot;based on<br/>&gt; some observable/measurable property&quot;.

The fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; everyone&apos;s first instinct was to run all over the keyboard playing<br/>&gt; &gt; things in every key, and that the idea was that all of the keys<br/>&gt; &gt; sounded like they had in-tune or out-of-tune versions of the same<br/>&gt; &gt; underlying symbolic or schematic things, seems to seems to support<br/>&gt; &gt; that hypothesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That &quot;everyone&apos;s first instinct was to run all over the keyboard playing<br/>&gt; things in every key&quot; seems a wild assertion, strongly contradicting<br/>&gt; centuries of notated music. Up through the Baroque, you&apos;ll find enharmonic<br/>&gt; modulation in orchestral works rather than keyboard works (dropping the<br/>&gt; harpsichord continue freed orchestras in this respect) which tend to &quot;stay<br/>&gt; within reach&quot;, whether by not modulating too far in the first place or by<br/>&gt; using keys easily reached with a few tuning tweaks between pieces. Have a<br/>&gt; chat with a harpsichordist doing Scarlatti in meantone.</p><p>Yeah, but you know what I&apos;m getting at here. It&apos;s the same concept of<br/>&quot;variations on the same fundamental thing&quot; vs &quot;different fundamental<br/>things&quot; again. I&apos;m talking about what I believe is the way that<br/>average listeners of the time heard it, which is that major triads in<br/>&quot;all keys&quot; on the keyboard were &quot;variations of the same schematic<br/>thing,&quot; with some of the &quot;more in-tune&quot; variety and some of the &quot;less<br/>in-tune&quot; variety. If this weren&apos;t the case, we&apos;d never have had things<br/>like Werckmeister temperament.</p><p>&gt; And speaking of Scarlatti, it is widely (but not universally, as far as I<br/>&gt; know) accepted that Scarlatti and others deliberated used the wolf as a<br/>&gt; wolf- a harpsichordist I was working with played me a passage clearly<br/>&gt; illustrating this (in Telemann, iirc) but I don&apos;t know examples off hand.</p><p>I have no problem believing that someone like Scarlatti or Gesualdo<br/>heard these as categorically different things, reachable by a<br/>different path of the circle of fifths or something, or that the most<br/>highly trained musicians would have also heard it that way. I&apos;m<br/>talking about the way that the average listener might have heard it.<br/>And also, if Scarlatti uses a &quot;wolf fifth&quot; as a &quot;deliberately out of<br/>tune fifth,&quot; that would still be in line with what I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>I happen to think this is a good principle to consider: quasi-equal<br/>chromatic scales allow for regularity in melody and purer harmony than<br/>the EDOs. Consider 19-EDO, for instance, which is often used as an<br/>ambient enharmonic scale for meantone[12], with meantone[7] being used<br/>as a prominent subset of that. One can do the same thing for 22-EDO<br/>and use it as an ambient enharmonic scale for porcupine[15], with<br/>porcupine[7] and porcupine[8] being used as prominent melodic and<br/>diatonic subsets.</p><p>&gt; Keep in mind that conflating &quot;keyboard music&quot; and &quot;Western music&quot; is fair<br/>&gt; enough if we&apos;re looking at the last century or so, but it is simply wrong<br/>&gt; otherwise. Did you know that Helmholtz lists 11:10 as a &quot;trumpet interval&quot;?<br/>&gt; Instrumentalists have become masters of fudging, and I imagine that it is<br/>&gt; now common for brass players not even to be aware of the fact that they are<br/>&gt; continually altering the natural tones of their instruments in order to play<br/>&gt; 12-tET, but &quot;proper&quot; writing for brass still requires intimate knowledge of<br/>&gt; the harmonic series.</p><p>I have no problem with any of this, I don&apos;t think we&apos;re on the same<br/>page. My question is this:</p><p>You understand that the average Western listener of today tends to<br/>hear minor and major thirds as being<br/>symbolically/&quot;schematically&quot;/&quot;categorically&quot;/whatever different<br/>intervals. Nobody that I know of hears them as just two ways to intone<br/>the same fundamental interval.</p><p>And, when the Western listener of today tends to hear something in<br/>meantone[7], they typically hear the 7/6 and 6/5 as being &quot;two<br/>different sizes of minor third,&quot; sometimes confusing the two at first.<br/>It should be noted that while one is an &quot;augmented second&quot; and one is<br/>a &quot;minor third&quot; under the meantone mapping, that as far as<br/>meantone[12] is concerned, they&apos;re both types of &quot;fourth&quot; or what have<br/>you.</p><p>The average Western listener can easily learn to distinguish between<br/>these two &quot;types of minor third.&quot; But the question is, does this<br/>distinguishing reach that schematic level I was talking about? Is it<br/>like they&apos;re now learning that 6/5 is a chair and 7/6 is a table, or<br/>that 6/5 is a red chair and that 7/6 is a yellow chair?</p><p>Most people that I know of in this community still think of it in the<br/>latter sense - like these are two types of the same thing. Maybe a few<br/>differ. I&apos;m not sure what sort of ear training might separate the two.</p><p>Now: in as much as the &quot;intonation is intonation of ________&quot; paradigm<br/>is concerned, consider quasi-equal scales. When you listen to a<br/>quasi-equal scale like tetracot[7], even though you can obviously tell<br/>apart things like the 3/2 fifth and the sharp 3/2 fifth, distinctions<br/>sometimes tend to blur together when you&apos;re playing melody or what<br/>have you. It requires a bit of training to be able to tell apart<br/>nearly ambiguous intervals in quasi-equal scales. (And if you don&apos;t<br/>agree, just keep tuning the scale closer and closer to equal until you<br/>do agree.)</p><p>Meantone[12] in quarter-comma, fifth-comma, sixth-comma meantone is<br/>pretty quasi-equal, compared to something like meantone[7] in those<br/>tunings, or compared to meantone[12] in 26-EDO, or what have you.<br/>Leopold Mozart had to teach his students to distinguish between the<br/>two sizes of semitone,<br/>which indicates to me that this sense of quasi-equalness is somewhat<br/>natural to experience - after all, intervals that differ by diesis<br/>really are smaller than those that differ by chroma and so on. I don&apos;t<br/>doubt that training can change this, or that Gesualdo didn&apos;t hear this<br/>differently, only that it&apos;s natural in some sense to hear those two<br/>types of half steps as being &quot;different types of the same thing,&quot; at<br/>least at first.</p><p>So my question is, do you think that the average listener in the<br/>meantone era - not Scarlatti, not Gesualdo, but the average listener -<br/>heard the two half steps, the two minor thirds, the two whatevers as<br/>being totally different intervals with different feelings and<br/>different schematic meanings and so on? Or do you think they heard<br/>them tending to blend together, and distinguishing them primarily in<br/>an intonational sense as variants of the same thing?</p><p>I think there&apos;s some reason to consider the latter view, given the<br/>trend towards well-temperament and equal-temperament later, and that<br/>the reason typically given for this trend was that &quot;people didn&apos;t like<br/>that all chords were playable in all keys.&quot;</p><p>-Mike</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>Yahoo!

Consider ||: Cmaj/E | Emaj :||. It&apos;s similar to ||: Am/E |<br/>&gt; Emaj :||, with the same sort of ambiguous root/temporary<br/>&gt; retonicization thing going on.</p><p>Yes, and in your examples you can see that the increasing use of harmonic movement by thirds/sixths during the celebrated &quot;collapse of the tonal system&quot; makes sense. My original point, which you are now further supporting, was that even in justly-intoned &quot;5-limit&quot;, roots are not always automagically spelled out for us.</p><p>&gt; Sure, it&apos;s real, but the distinctness doesn&apos;t end up filtering down &gt;to<br/>&gt; the symbolic meaning of the intervals for me such that I perceive<br/>&gt; these two intonations of minor seventh as actually being two &gt;different<br/>&gt; intervals. And if you played someone a V7 chord at the end of a<br/>&gt; progression going back to the tonic and didn&apos;t resolve it even in<br/>&gt; barbershop, I&apos;m sure people would still want it to resolve.</p><p>Yes, but traditionally (which I took pains to point out was what I was talking about), function is contextual and an augmented sixth does not have the same function or resolution tendency as the minor seventh. How much of this is psychoacoustic and how much is a holdover from 1/4-comma thinking, I don&apos;t know (and would seriously doubt anyone who claims to &quot;know&quot;). I, personally, find it only weakly true that these tendencies are built in psychoacoustically; nevertheless, a solid enough phenomenon to consider the tradtional assignment of the 7th partial to aug. 6 and 3:2*6:5 to the 7th partial superior to what seems to me both 12-tET and naive thinking in lumping the two together at 7:4.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know if this is really barbershop, but it definitely has &gt;that<br/>&gt; sort of JI sound<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4NafK3NFhA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4NafK3NFhA</a></p><p>Four Freshmen are awesome. Definitely Just vertical harmonies all over- the roots, it seems to me, are moving in 12-tET, don&apos;t you think?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, but I was talking about the virtual fundamental. All of those<br/>&gt; effects we just mentioned were definitely not just a lack of beating.<br/>&gt; I bet I&apos;d have heard a bunch of them even if you&apos;d used square waves<br/>&gt; or even sines.</p><p>Yes, except the portamento effects, which are due to partial coincidences- I can plot these out in my head or on paper and they&apos;ll work as long there are enough partials to realize them.</p><p>&gt; My point is that the psychoacoustic qualities associated with this<br/>&gt; thing aren&apos;t really &quot;objective&quot; because adaptation can train many of<br/>&gt; them, sometimes in unknown and complex ways. The analogy again is that<br/>&gt; they&apos;re as objective as being able to deadlift 300 pounds is<br/>&gt; objective. Most people can objectively adapt to be able to do it, but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not just like an ability that anyone can do at any point in<br/>&gt; time.</p><p>I think this is a very poor analogy, because even if I were to discount thousands of years of testimony, except for one guy with pretty severe hearing damage, no one to whom I have presented examples, nay, none not once, has failed to immediately distinguish between &quot;church/choir/ethnic/bluesy/sleepy/etc&quot;. intonation and 12-tET intonation. 300 lbs? More like 3 lbs.</p><p>I think you do not realize that contemporary Western academic musical training trains people to listen past these things.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, I have always read and heard that training (and inherited<br/>&gt; &gt; predisposition) accounts for wider windows of musical perception in some<br/>&gt; &gt; than others. Makes sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is just referring to this one psychoacoustic phenomenon though. I<br/>&gt; think that the &quot;windows&quot; you&apos;re talking about here have to do with<br/>&gt; some kind of learned, synthetic reification process. I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; that arpeggiated chords directly activate any of the psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; phenomena we&apos;ve mentioned so far, but that someone can learn to view<br/>&gt; them as the musical equivalent of a search light tracing out a<br/>&gt; background structure, for instance. I note that this sort of thing is<br/>&gt; undeterred by things like passing tones and chromatic notes and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It may be that psychoacoustics has some kind of basic &quot;imprinting&quot;<br/>&gt; effect in the sort of structures that you recognize, which could<br/>&gt; explain some of the recent confusion with Gene&apos;s example. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; really know. But I do think that there&apos;s a strong reification<br/>&gt; component to this aspect of musical perception, and that it&apos;s learned,<br/>&gt; and that it might be the same sort of process that allows one to reify<br/>&gt; in &quot;roots&quot; and &quot;tonal centers&quot; and so on in heirarchical fashion<br/>&gt; (which was my whole spiel about Schenkerian analysis).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But editing recordings, even from not terribly<br/>&gt; &gt; lively acoustic spaces, will show you that the horizontal carries literally,<br/>&gt; &gt; not just in perception, further than you might think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re talking about things like the impulse response of the room,<br/>&gt; then I&apos;d say that I don&apos;t think that&apos;s terribly important in<br/>&gt; establishing the affect of chords, at least not to a trained listener,<br/>&gt; because I tend to hear chord progressions just fine even if played on<br/>&gt; a monophonic instrument with sawtooth waves and no reverb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=103802 href="#103802">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2012 4:01:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, but you know what I&apos;m getting at here. It&apos;s the same concept of<br/>&gt; &quot;variations on the same fundamental thing&quot; vs &quot;different fundamental<br/>&gt; things&quot; again. I&apos;m talking about what I believe is the way that<br/>&gt; average listeners of the time heard it, which is that major triads in<br/>&gt; &quot;all keys&quot; on the keyboard were &quot;variations of the same schematic<br/>&gt; thing,&quot; with some of the &quot;more in-tune&quot; variety and some of the &quot;less<br/>&gt; in-tune&quot; variety. If this weren&apos;t the case, we&apos;d never have had things<br/>&gt; like Werckmeister temperament.</p><p>Something I&apos;ve noticed over the years as that there is a great deal said about &quot;modulation&quot; and temperaments, but little (nothing that I can recall, actually) said about transposition. If we imagine what probably constituted a great and vital important part of the music of the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century in the Western world, the era of the entrenchment of 12-tET, we will hear in our mind&apos;s eye family and friends gathered around a piano singing a hit tune- diatonic, modulating little if at all, and transposed to fit the ranges of the group. And, much &quot;modulation&quot; is effected by simple transposition. This remains de rigueur in sappy &quot;folk&quot; music, &quot;country&quot;, in Europe and America.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And speaking of Scarlatti, it is widely (but not universally, as far as I<br/>&gt; &gt; know) accepted that Scarlatti and others deliberated used the wolf as a<br/>&gt; &gt; wolf- a harpsichordist I was working with played me a passage clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; illustrating this (in Telemann, iirc) but I don&apos;t know examples off hand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no problem believing that someone like Scarlatti or Gesualdo<br/>&gt; heard these as categorically different things, reachable by a<br/>&gt; different path of the circle of fifths or something, or that the most<br/>&gt; highly trained musicians would have also heard it that way. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; talking about the way that the average listener might have heard it.<br/>&gt; And also, if Scarlatti uses a &quot;wolf fifth&quot; as a &quot;deliberately out of<br/>&gt; tune fifth,&quot; that would still be in line with what I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>Something else to consider is the vast historical revision that takes place, for the most part unconsciously I am sure, in musicology or any other historical study in the arts. Did you know that the statuary of the ancient Greeks was brightly, garishly by today&apos;s standards, painted? The paint was deliberately scraped off by European collectors, there are even written records of scrapings. Enough remains in cracks and crevices to analize and recreate the orignal colors; an exhibition was held in Berlin a few years ago. I love it, many are shocked silly. But there is no serious question that the originals were painted, the fact is even mentioned in ancient literature (a woman stricken with some tragic emotion is described as pale as a statue without paint, in Homer iirc, for example).</p><p>Same jive happens in musicology, I could do a whole song and dance about the deliberate complete rewriting (westernization) of Eastern European music in the 19th century. A lot of what you- and I - learned about music history, tuning and temperament is probably best described as semi-true. The revisionism of the &quot;JI&quot; school, which is perpetuated on this list, is just as corny as the party line, beware.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I happen to think this is a good principle to consider: quasi-equal<br/>&gt; chromatic scales allow for regularity in melody and purer harmony than<br/>&gt; the EDOs. Consider 19-EDO, for instance, which is often used as an<br/>&gt; ambient enharmonic scale for meantone[12], with meantone[7] being used<br/>&gt; as a prominent subset of that. One can do the same thing for 22-EDO<br/>&gt; and use it as an ambient enharmonic scale for porcupine[15], with<br/>&gt; porcupine[7] and porcupine[8] being used as prominent melodic and<br/>&gt; diatonic subsets.</p><p>Sure- can you put together some examples? Don&apos;t worry about making undying masterpieces, nobody whose opinion is worth considering is going to write you off for failing to write a tuning etude that doesn&apos;t save the whales and make your jimmy thicker.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no problem with any of this, I don&apos;t think we&apos;re on the same<br/>&gt; page. My question is this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You understand that the average Western listener of today tends to<br/>&gt; hear minor and major thirds as being<br/>&gt; symbolically/&quot;schematically&quot;/&quot;categorically&quot;/whatever different<br/>&gt; intervals. Nobody that I know of hears them as just two ways to &gt;intone<br/>&gt; the same fundamental interval.</p><p>Yes and no- they&apos;re both &quot;thirds&quot; after all.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, when the Western listener of today tends to hear something in<br/>&gt; meantone[7], they typically hear the 7/6 and 6/5 as being &quot;two<br/>&gt; different sizes of minor third,&quot; sometimes confusing the two at &gt;first.</p><p>Naive listeners, in my experience, distinguish strongly, immediately, on the level of &quot;feel&quot;. One&apos;s bluesy, one is &quot;normal&quot;, something like that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The average Western listener can easily learn to distinguish between<br/>&gt; these two &quot;types of minor third.&quot; But the question is, does this<br/>&gt; distinguishing reach that schematic level I was talking about? Is it<br/>&gt; like they&apos;re now learning that 6/5 is a chair and 7/6 is a table, or<br/>&gt; that 6/5 is a red chair and that 7/6 is a yellow chair?</p><p>That must depend on the structure overall. In typical western structures I am sure that these intervals are heard as different flavors of the same thing. But, in a common practice piece an augmented second is distinct even if it is tuned exactly the same as the minor third. Distinguishing the tuning as well would make the distinction even more marked.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most people that I know of in this community still think of it in the<br/>&gt; latter sense - like these are two types of the same thing. Maybe a few<br/>&gt; differ. I&apos;m not sure what sort of ear training might separate the two.</p><p>Listening in context.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now: in as much as the &quot;intonation is intonation of ________&quot; paradigm<br/>&gt; is concerned, consider quasi-equal scales. When you listen to a<br/>&gt; quasi-equal scale like tetracot[7], even though you can obviously tell<br/>&gt; apart things like the 3/2 fifth and the sharp 3/2 fifth, distinctions<br/>&gt; sometimes tend to blur together when you&apos;re playing melody or what<br/>&gt; have you. It requires a bit of training to be able to tell apart<br/>&gt; nearly ambiguous intervals in quasi-equal scales. (And if you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; agree, just keep tuning the scale closer and closer to equal until you<br/>&gt; do agree.)</p><p>Oh sure. I think that we need to be wary of things homologous to founding a school of visual thought based on Op-Art, though.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meantone[12] in quarter-comma, fifth-comma, sixth-comma meantone is<br/>&gt; pretty quasi-equal, compared to something like meantone[7] in those<br/>&gt; tunings, or compared to meantone[12] in 26-EDO, or what have you.<br/>&gt; Leopold Mozart had to teach his students to distinguish between the<br/>&gt; two sizes of semitone,<br/>&gt; which indicates to me that this sense of quasi-equalness is somewhat<br/>&gt; natural to experience - after all, intervals that differ by diesis<br/>&gt; really are smaller than those that differ by chroma and so on. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; doubt that training can change this, or that Gesualdo didn&apos;t hear this<br/>&gt; differently, only that it&apos;s natural in some sense to hear those two<br/>&gt; types of half steps as being &quot;different types of the same thing,&quot; at<br/>&gt; least at first.</p><p>Sure- my concern is that we don&apos;t get into &quot;a taco is really just a variation of the hamburger, selah&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=103803 href="#103803">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2012 5:36:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gbreed@...&quot; &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like the way Magic twists these categories. 25:24 approximates to the interval class I call a &apos;semitoe&apos;. 16:15 divides into two equal semitoes which makes the two intervals we normally call &apos;semitones&apos; completely different.<br/>&gt; The run of tones 9/8, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 9/7, 4/3 are all separated by semitoes and so become equally spaced in Magic temperaments.

In the example I more recently presented, in which the &quot;C&quot; is a pedal and the chords move such that C is the eleventh partial, then the ninth, then seventh, and so on down, more than 30 discrete pitches are required even without full 11th chords at each new identity for C.</p><p>The scheme itself is obviously very simple. But it generates masses of pitches very quickly, and adding root movement by 5ths/4ths will generate even more, offset by syntonic commas.</p><p>53-edo- all of it- is perfect for implementing this scheme up to the 11th partial and probably the 13th as well.</p><p>The case of distinguishing between harmonic and &quot;dominant&quot; seventh chords also generates many tones and easily steps out of MOS structures. You need numerous instances of full harmonic structures, and Pythagorean root movement will entail needing these structures offset by the syntonic comma as well.</p><p>Once again, not once have I criticized the temperaments themselves. Quite the contrary- the examples I give could be titled &quot;reasons to use temperament&quot; (specifically 41 and 53 equal temperaments).</p><p>No, the problem is that of practical application, and the unavoidable fact that temperaments cannot both reach every prime at lightening speed and be accurate at the same time.</p></div><h3><a id=103820 href="#103820">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2012 12:21:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Feb 22, 2012 at 4:43 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure, but then I think that chords in first inversion can be ambiguous<br/>&gt; &gt; too then.

I,<br/>&gt; personally, find it only weakly true that these tendencies are built in<br/>&gt; psychoacoustically; nevertheless, a solid enough phenomenon to consider the<br/>&gt; tradtional assignment of the 7th partial to aug. 6 and 3:2*6:5 to the 7th<br/>&gt; partial superior to what seems to me both 12-tET and naive thinking in<br/>&gt; lumping the two together at 7:4.</p><p>What about 16/9?

I think Partch jives like it&apos;s going out of business, but he makes some really incisive observations as well- his take on the old controversy about the &quot;real&quot; root of a minor triad is right on. Pick that one that sounds right to you and move on.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, but traditionally (which I took pains to point out was what I was<br/>&gt; &gt; talking about), function is contextual and an augmented sixth does not have<br/>&gt; &gt; the same function or resolution tendency as the minor seventh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7/4 to me usually sounds like a minor seventh. C G E B E A# makes the<br/>&gt; outer note sound like an aug 6. It&apos;s the chords I imagine inside some<br/>&gt; kind of complex interval like that that dictate the way it sounds like<br/>&gt; to me, not the intonation. Maybe it&apos;s just me.</p><p>I would be amazed if you hear the 7:4 and 9:5 in the piece I just posted, &quot;magical thinking&quot;, as two intonations of the same interval, though.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about 16/9? In 22-EDO, dominant 7 chords resolve way better if<br/>&gt; you use 16/9 = 7/4 as the minor 7 than 9/5 = 11/6.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s yet another thing. Basically, conflating tertian chords and harmonic structures is bogus.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Er, what are we talking about? I was making the point that musical<br/>&gt; training can cause actual changes in the cochlea and auditory<br/>&gt; brainstem and auditory cortex and so on.

A friend of mine who can&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket or keep a beat, much less analize a piece of music, is an excellent professional mixing engineer. Maybe I shouldn&apos;t say unschooled, but schooled otherwise, because you could say he&apos;s an excellent &quot;purely-spectral&quot; musician. When I tried to explain alternative tunings to him, I realized that he did not know that there are 12 keys to the octave on the piano. But he spots all these spectral effects of beating, fusing, blending, etc. better than I do.</p></div><h3><a id=103823 href="#103823">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2012 2:23:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Wed, Feb 22, 2012 at 7:01 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no problem believing that someone like Scarlatti or Gesualdo<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; heard these as categorically different things, reachable by a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; different path of the circle of fifths or something, or that the most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; highly trained musicians would have also heard it that way.

So I can hardly expect anyone to remember that.</p><p>&gt;You&apos;ll also tend towards the MOS scales.</p><p>If that were the only consideration, yes. Introducing the syntonic comma via Pythagorean structures messes up this tidiness, however.</p><p>&gt; The message was &quot;Seventh chords, intonation, and function.&quot; The &gt;chords as I worked them out use twenty thirds piled up above the &gt;tonic. All but one outlying pitch fit in the sixteen note MOS. &gt;Seventh degrees above ii would be more remote but I don&apos;t know if &gt;they&apos;re required or how they&apos;re tuned.</p><p>But the chords are not all &quot;above the tonic&quot;. I explained this carefully, but okay, more slowly this time.</p><p>(When we say above or below, we are of course talking about first or root position).</p><p>Let us call our tonic C. A tertian chord is built on, above, this C. Now, this C remains as a pedal tone, and a tertian chord forms BELOW the C. In the example I presented, C became the 11th partial of the following chord.</p><p>In traditional terms, a common-tone modulation which is also an enharmonic modulation.</p><p>Even in tempered systems using 41 or 53 tones, you already have both an &quot;F#&quot; and a &quot;Gb&quot;, and a lot of different pitches. In the example I more recently presented, in which the &quot;C&quot; is a pedal and the chords move such that C is the eleventh partial, then the ninth, then seventh, and so on down, more than 30 discrete pitches are required even without full 11th chords at each new identity for C.</p><p>The scheme itself is obviously very simple. But it generates masses of pitches very quickly, and adding root movement by 5ths/4ths will generate even more, offset by syntonic commas.</p><p>53-edo- all of it- is perfect for implementing this scheme up to the 11th partial and probably the 13th as well.</p><p>The case of distinguishing between harmonic and &quot;dominant&quot; seventh chords also generates many tones and easily steps out of MOS structures. You need numerous instances of full harmonic structures, and Pythagorean root movement will entail needing these structures offset by the syntonic comma as well.</p><p>Once again, not once have I criticized the temperaments themselves. Quite the contrary- the examples I give could be titled &quot;reasons to use temperament&quot; (specifically 41 and 53 equal temperaments).</p><p>No, the problem is that of practical application, and the unavoidable fact that temperaments cannot both reach every prime at lightening speed and be accurate at the same time.</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>Yahoo!

If it were merely a matter of using tunings which potentially temper out commas, obviously I would have cited Salinas and 1/3-comma meantone. That would not have been good, because until the time of Schubert at least, enharmonic chromaticism and augmented chords had not reached a critical mass such that we could reasonably speak of five major thirds making a perfect twelfth, and it is the appearance of the small diesis in this way that is key to &quot;magic&quot;.</p><p>The music of Janko&apos;s time rendered in 41-edo does implement the temperament that is called &quot;magic&quot; here, though.

Effecting a temperament, probably by accident, doesn&apos;t constitute having created one of the systems which are called &quot;temperaments&quot; here.

I can hardly imagine what they &gt;would sound like. (Also I have no idea how to begin searching for &gt;them, so I&apos;d really appreciate some actual examples.)</p><p>Remember that I am not saying that late Romantic music was conceived in magic temperament, or that magic temperament would make for appropriate tempering and consequent tuning systems for that music. Far from it- if music &quot;activates&quot; a temperament, so to speak, but was not made with that temperament and its effects in mind, using that temperament could be disastrous.</p><p>We could also say that by Janko&apos;s time, there was a great deal of music for which magic temperament would be singularly unsuitable. The very augmented chords and enharmonics which would bring the temperament into play would also reveal how wrong the temperament is for that music. I would even say that in choosing 41-tET, Janko either didn&apos;t realize the consequences, or had more strictly tonal music in mind than the modern music of his time. The Janko 12-tET keyboard suggests the latter- it is very much made to &quot;play music in different keys&quot;.</p><p>For examples of music that would &quot;activate&quot; magic temperament, we don&apos;t have to look further than the very first measures of textbook romantic augmented triad example No. 1, Liszt&apos;s Faust.</p><p>The Faust theme is simply these augmented triads in this order:</p><p>(Ab)<br/>Eb, G, B<br/>Bb, D, F#<br/>F, A, C#<br/>C, E, G#</p><p>As you see, the triads are a P5 apart. If we tune M3 to 4:5, and 4:5 is &quot;magic&quot; tempered, the chords are not only related by P5, but by M3s (and of course would be spelled differently; translating into magic from the jumble of meantone + 12-tET spelling you find in Romantic music is pretty hairy).</p><p>This is wonderful, in my opinion. You might say that &quot;magic&quot; is an ideal &quot;steam punk&quot; temperament, because you can do lovely futuristic things starting with 19th-century ideas.</p><p>It makes hash of the original thing, though, try it. Faust piano reductions are available free, here:</p><p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Faust_Symphony,_S.108_%28Liszt,_Franz%29">http://imslp.org/wiki/Faust_Symphony,_S.108_%28Liszt,_Franz%29</a></p><p>The initial Ab and the G# at the end of the exposition are of course not enharmonic equivalences in magic, for starters.</p><p>Now, you wanted to know what I think &quot;fits the bill&quot;, but it is not really a question of what *I* think. Personally, I do NOT accept this example, even though technically speaking, you could hardly say that magic temperament would not come into play were this theme to be rendered under the conditions of Just approximation and 41 equal divisions of the octave. For one thing you could insist that the opening Ab and the G# must be the same pitch, or you could (correctly in my opinion) say that these augmented triads are actually coloristic units set P5s apart- there are probably other arguments as well. The clincher for me is that this example provides no reasonably audible manifestation of anything specifically &quot;magic&quot;, even if you tune it to magic, regardless of the magic relation of the P5 to the M3s.</p><p>Just a few minutes thought provides other examples from that era- as magic tempers out 100/99, the A-F# key relation in Korsakov&apos;s Antar makes for F# at a very good 11:8, all kinds of 7-limit intervallic relationships will show up, even as far back as Mozart (try b:i,V common tone on f# modulation to D:I).</p><p>Unfortunately I do not have near enough time as I&apos;d like to dig into this, but I&apos;ll keep at it. For one thing a simple implementation of the magic comma in a more or less common practice type of setting seems in line, have to put one up.</p></div><h3><a id=103953 href="#103953">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2012 11:20:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gbreed@...&quot; &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Discovering one facet of a temperament doesn&apos;t become a discovery of a temperament until you recognize its importance in relation to other facets.

That&apos;s important<br/>to me because I don&apos;t find Meantone to be good enough but<br/>I&apos;m quite happy with Magic.

It<br/>happens that this leads to another essentially tempered<br/>triad where a major sixth (5/3) is divided into two<br/>categorical perception-breaking intervals of 9/7.  It&apos;s a<br/>chord I didn&apos;t notice before and haven&apos;t used.  It&apos;s<br/>something interesting that we could be talking about if<br/>talking about the harmonic possibilities of temperaments<br/>were something that we did.</p><p>Another magic comma is 875:864.  It allows you to divide a<br/>7/4 into three equal steps of 6/5.  I think that&apos;s<br/>interesting as well.  It would give an essentially tempered<br/>chord in the 11-limit when you temper out 100:99.</p><p>These three commas are the simplest in the kernel of the<br/>7-limit mapping of 41-equal.   It&apos;s quite reasonable to<br/>assume that somebody writing music in 41-equal would<br/>discover these commas, and write a piece that depended on<br/>them, thereby inventing Magic by the back door without any<br/>recognition of the 5-limit comma. All we need is evidence<br/>that somebody did so.</p><p>The three simplest commas tempered out by 22-equal also<br/>happen to define Pajara (50:49, 64:63, 225:224).

Still, the fact is that<br/>Paul Erlich published first (until we find an earlier<br/>reference) and at that point understood the nature of the<br/>temperament.</p><p>It&apos;s been a decade now and we haven&apos;t found a citation for<br/>Magic thinking before 2001.

Magic is the simplest temperament class that can<br/>&gt; improve on Meantone&apos;s 9-limit accuracy.  That&apos;s important<br/>&gt; to me because I don&apos;t find Meantone to be good enough but<br/>&gt; I&apos;m quite happy with Magic.  It also happens that every<br/>&gt; 9-limit interval is better tuned in Magic than in 12-equal.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Taken as a 9-limit temperament, the simplest commas are<br/>&gt; 225:224 and 245:243.  The former defines Marvel and is<br/>&gt; almost ubiquitous in 7-limit equal temperaments.  (Who<br/>&gt; first noticed that?  Another interesting historical<br/>&gt; question.)  Marvel turns augmented triads into essentially<br/>&gt; tempered 9-limit chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Magic what you get by combining Marvel with 245:243.  It<br/>&gt; happens that this leads to another essentially tempered<br/>&gt; triad where a major sixth (5/3) is divided into two<br/>&gt; categorical perception-breaking intervals of 9/7.  It&apos;s a<br/>&gt; chord I didn&apos;t notice before and haven&apos;t used.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; something interesting that we could be talking about if<br/>&gt; talking about the harmonic possibilities of temperaments<br/>&gt; were something that we did.</p><p>Yes, this is a very nice harmony. The way my saz is voiced, I can play this kind of chord easily in a couple of different voicings (the saz is tuned to a system of seventeen very roughly equal).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another magic comma is 875:864.  It allows you to divide a<br/>&gt; 7/4 into three equal steps of 6/5.  I think that&apos;s<br/>&gt; interesting as well.  It would give an essentially tempered<br/>&gt; chord in the 11-limit when you temper out 100:99.</p><p>Yes- the higher limits proceed &quot;naturally&quot; from the 5-limit in &quot;magic&quot;. Or vice-versa, as you seem to have originally concieved it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; These three commas are the simplest in the kernel of the<br/>&gt; 7-limit mapping of 41-equal.   It&apos;s quite reasonable to<br/>&gt; assume that somebody writing music in 41-equal would<br/>&gt; discover these commas, and write a piece that depended on<br/>&gt; them, thereby inventing Magic by the back door without any<br/>&gt; recognition of the 5-limit comma. All we need is evidence<br/>&gt; that somebody did so.</p><p>You&apos;ve seen the Fokker article describing the higher limits in 41, I assume. There is nothing there about the modalities required to bring these into play, though.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The three simplest commas tempered out by 22-equal also<br/>&gt; happen to define Pajara (50:49, 64:63, 225:224).  It&apos;s not<br/>&gt; surprising that somebody (apparently Gene) found Pajara<br/>&gt; scales by playing with 22-equal.  Still, the fact is that<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich published first (until we find an earlier<br/>&gt; reference) and at that point understood the nature of the<br/>&gt; temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s been a decade now and we haven&apos;t found a citation for<br/>&gt; Magic thinking before 2001.  It would be interesting if you<br/>&gt; unearth any prehistory.  As I said before, George Secor was<br/>&gt; doing something with it but he wasn&apos;t looking for a 9-limit<br/>&gt; temperament and didn&apos;t publish anything about it at the<br/>&gt; time.

In making this judgment I was going mainly on intuition, unaware that I was using concepts such as MOS and Rothenberg propriety that would later be formally defined.

I simply identified the generating interval and the EDO&apos;s that supported each temperament, and most of the graphs weren&apos;t even included in the paper.  My main objective in making the graphs was to determine the specific size of the generator that gave the best intonation and to compare the intonation of each EDO with the best and with one another.

On the 2nd &amp; 4th pages the ratios of 11 are particularly difficult to see (the line for the 9:11 generator on the 2nd page, which crosses the x-axis at 695 cents, is very faint), because I used a turquoise pencil for 11, a color that does not copy well.  (If you think it necessary and/or worth-while, I could make digital color photographs of these pages that would be more legible.)</p><p>There are 3 other temperaments I found, dating from around 1975.

So in this case i think<br/>&gt; George might be giving more credit elsewhere than maybe<br/>&gt; he should.</p><p>The link shows that Wilson was still looking at the<br/>Cassandra/Schismatic (29&amp;41) mapping.  There&apos;s something to<br/>be said for that because it maps the 43 notes of the Genesis<br/>scale to 41 distinctly tempered notes with the only<br/>ambiguity being the unavoidable one from 11/10 and 10/9<br/>mapping to the same pitch.  This means we have to ignore<br/>100:99.  (Two notes disappear because each pitch occurs<br/>with its octave complement.)</p><p>You may recall that each of the 43 pitches is distinct in<br/>Miracle (31&amp;41) temperament.  For the earlier Exposition on<br/>Monophony scale, these 43 distinct pitches are included in<br/>the first 45 Miracle generated pitches.</p><p>I&apos;ve been looking at the ambiguous 41 note temperings<br/>again.  The coincidence of 43 just pitches mapping to a 41<br/>note MOS doesn&apos;t hold with Cassandra and the Exposition<br/>scale.  49/48 maps to 29 fifths.</p><p>To get exactly 41 tempered pitches, a rank 2 mapping has to<br/>be consistent with 41-equal and temper out 100:99.  It must<br/>have an 11-limit complexity of no more than 20.  The<br/>highest complexity for an 11-limit pitch will then be 20<br/>generators from the 1/1.  Each pitch occurs with its octave<br/>complement in the diamond, and the 11-limit diamond is a<br/>subset of either Partch scale, so there will be 40<br/>generators between these two worst-case pitches.  40<br/>generators means 41 pitches.</p><p>The only mappings that comply with these conditions are<br/>those for Cassandra, Octacot (31&amp;27e), and Magic (19&amp;22).<br/>It turns out that Octacot needs 57 generated notes to<br/>approximate either 43 note scale.  But Magic needs exactly<br/>41 for either scale. So both scales correspond to<br/>periodicity blocks that detemper the 41 note Magic MOS with<br/>two ambiguous pairs of pitches.  Only Magic works like this<br/>for both scales.  Only Magic and Cassandra work like this<br/>for either scale.</p><p>The discrepancy between the Genesis and Exposition scales<br/>amounts to an interval of 245:243.  Tempering out 245:243<br/>is the same as ignoring the difference between the two<br/>scales.  Combining this with the 100:99 that allows us to<br/>fit the 11-limit diamond into 41 pitches is consistent with<br/>these temperaments:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=100%3A99+245%3A243&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=100%3A99+245%3A243&limit=11</a></p><p>The most accurate are Bohpier (41&amp;8d), Magic, Octacot, and<br/>Varan (41&amp;5e). This is another way of producing a shortlist<br/>that includes Magic.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
