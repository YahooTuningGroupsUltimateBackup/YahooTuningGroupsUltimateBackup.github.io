Atonal, on the other<br/>hand (as Schoenberg pointed out)<br/>is somewhat of an oxymoron, in that<br/>every non-percussive sound that is<br/>involved in music vibrates with some<br/>kind of periodicity, thus music on<br/>sustaining instruments must always<br/>exhibit *some* kind of tonality, by virtue<br/>of the fact that sustained musical sounds<br/>always exhibit some kind of numerical<br/>frequency relationship.</p><p>How tonality is defined is, however,<br/>another matter altogether.</p><p>It&apos;s been pointed out more than once<br/>that Schoenberg and his pupils (especially<br/>Berg) often contrived their rows so<br/>that subtle and shifting allusions to<br/>tonality could be discerned.</p><p>One of the most outstanding examples<br/>I&apos;ve found of microtonal serialism is<br/>Ben Johnston&apos;s _6th Quartet_.<br/>Johnston divides each row into two<br/>hexachords, one otonal and one utonal,<br/>and each hexachord is a complete<br/>11-limit &quot;tonality&quot; (in Partch&apos;s sense).<br/>Johnston contrived a very complex<br/>scheme of tonal relationships in his<br/>manipulation of the rows (retrograde,<br/>inversion, etc.), and most importantly,<br/>*it sounds good!*</p><p>The relevant references are Norton,<br/>_Tonality In Western Culture_, Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>_Harmonielehre_ and _Style and Idea_,<br/>and Steven Elster&apos;s great analysis of the<br/>Johnston in _Perspectives of New Music_.<br/>There was an old vinyl recording of Johnston&apos;s<br/>piece -- don&apos;t know if it&apos;s out on CD yet<br/>(but check your local library for the vinyl copy).<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
