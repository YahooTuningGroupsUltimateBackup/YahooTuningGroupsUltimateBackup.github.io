Some notes are missing so we can put bad intervals there.</p><p>The flutes are high in pitch and the difference tones are very loud.</p><p>That&apos;s why I need a &quot;differencial coherence&quot; in my scale.<br/>My lowest flute plays C-D-E-F-G<br/>And the highest flute plays G-A-B-C-D. I would love that all combinations between the 2 flutes would generate beautiful difference tones ;)</p><p>As a sum-up:</p><p>I would love perfect fifths there:</p><p>C-G; D-A;E-B; F-C<br/>And beautiful fourth there:<br/>D-G; E-A<br/>Why not pure major thirds there:<br/>F-A; G-B<br/>And pure minor thirds there:</p><p>E-G<br/>and as a conclusion beautiful sixths there:<br/>C-A; D-B; F-D</p><p>If anybody can help me on this question, even help me to take the question on the right way...I will be thankful for the rest of my days!<br/>Jerome</p></div><h3>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2012 2:53:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me D&eacute;sigaud &lt;jeromedesigaud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would love perfect fifths there:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C-G; D-A;E-B; F-C<br/>&gt; And beautiful fourth there:<br/>&gt; D-G; E-A<br/>&gt; Why not pure major thirds there:<br/>&gt; F-A; G-B<br/>&gt; And pure minor thirds there:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E-G<br/>&gt; and as a conclusion beautiful sixths there:<br/>&gt; C-A; D-B; F-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If anybody can help me on this question, even help me to take the question on the right way...I will be thankful for the rest of my days!<br/>&gt; Jerome<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you want F-C-G-D-A-E to be tuned by perfect fifths/fourths, and you also want F-D to be a just major sixth, then meantone tempering is probably your best bet.

With just intonation it would be mathematically impossible to get most of those consonances at the same time.</p><p>You shouldn&apos;t worry at all that it&apos;s temperament rather than just intonation, because meantone is an accurate temperament and it&apos;s going to sound more or less pure. In fact, depending on the specific design of the double flute, a phenomenon known as injection locking or injection pulling may occur that causes the two pitches to adjust to each other slightly to make the current interval more pure.</p><p>So yeah, meantone is the answer. I personally would have given 1/4-comma meantone but the 2/7-comma meantone given above is nearly indistinguishable; they&apos;re both good meantones.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2012 3:21:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, May 23, 2012 at 6:16 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You shouldn&apos;t worry at all that it&apos;s temperament rather than just<br/>&gt; intonation, because meantone is an accurate temperament and it&apos;s going to<br/>&gt; sound more or less pure.

Also, if you want something a bit more<br/>xenharmonic, you could also try superpyth, which tempers out 64/63<br/>instead of 81/80. Then minor sevenths will be close to 7/4, so<br/>root-fifth-minor 7 triads will be close to 4:6:7. It serves as an<br/>alternate way to intone the usual diatonic scale.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>kraiggrady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2012 5:55:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chances are if the holes are equally spaced apart, you have two subharmonic series.<br/>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div>
