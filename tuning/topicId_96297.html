I looked at all the 7 prime limit notes that relate to 1/1 which belong to the list on page 26 of my book. I selected 11 notes (after 1/1) from the list that contained a 7 or a multiple of 7 in the numerator or denominator. Here&apos;s what I got..</p><p>1/1<br/>15/14<br/>8/7<br/>7/6<br/>9/7<br/>21/16<br/>7/5<br/>10/7<br/>14/9<br/>12/7<br/>7/4<br/>27/14<br/>2/1</p><p>Playing the scale on my keyboard it was clear that 1/1 did not sound like a tonic (or a resolved sounding note). Playing around with the scale it seemed to me that 7/6 (the fourth note) sounded like a better choice of tonic. So, starting with 7/6 I multiplied each note by 6/7 to get the scale you have below. Some of the intervals are only 35 cents wide but I must say the scale sounds (to me at least) exotic and intriguing.</p><p>Have you tried it yourself?</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very interesting scale...how did you derive it, John?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s a 7 prime limit just scale cramming in as many 7&apos;s as possible.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Seventh Heaven<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1<br/>&gt; &gt; 54/49<br/>&gt; &gt; 9/8<br/>&gt; &gt; 6/5<br/>&gt; &gt; 60/49<br/>&gt; &gt; 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt; 72/49<br/>&gt; &gt; 3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; 81/49<br/>&gt; &gt; 12/7<br/>&gt; &gt; 90/49<br/>&gt; &gt; 96/49<br/>&gt; &gt; 2/1<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With the version I posted earlier the tonic was the fourth note in the scale.

It has at least one perfect Mohajira tetrachord :<br/>[90/49   1/1    9/8   60/49]<br/>and a strange Rast-Mohajira hybrid scale :<br/>[1/1   54/49  60/49   4/3   3/2   81/49   90/49], that would be a full Mohajira with 80/49 instead of 81/49.</p><p>Note that the reason that the scale is in fact, not so &quot;7th-limit&quot; but sounding rather &quot;11th-limit&quot; (hear for example the &quot;11/8&quot; between 6/5 and 81/49) is because you started from, except for 1/1, ONLY with ratios including 7. So obviously 12/7 is your former 1/1 and perhaps too much isolated now.
