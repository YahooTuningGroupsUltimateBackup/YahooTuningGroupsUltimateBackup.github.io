I&apos;ll have some time to review it during the first part of the week, as well as spend more time with Graham&apos;s note.</p><p>I can probably find Skip&apos;s email address from the web pages I found, but if you have it handy, could you send it to me off-list? I&apos;d like to drop him a note concurrent with anything I write to the list as a courtesy. In fact, I want to write him anyway...</p><p>Wishing Springtime to you all,<br/>Jon</p></div>
