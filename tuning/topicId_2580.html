Electronic tuners are not always as accurate as</p><p>you might have imagined... &gt;&gt;</p><p>Greetings,<br/>   I must disagree.  It might seem logical that simply matching a string to a<br/>fork would be fast and accurate, but in practicality, the reverse is true.<br/>The use of sets of forks was a limited experiment,  and in the tuning<br/>literature, there is scant evidence that many tuners followed this.

You seem to be inventing difficulties<br/>that don&apos;t exist. &lt;&lt;</p><p>  Oh, the difficulties exist, I work with them daily.  &quot;Strings are equal to<br/>forks&quot; isn&apos;t descriptive, because forks don&apos;t produce the spectra that strings<br/>do.  All the fork will do is place a fundamental, but the tempering of<br/>intervals is measured by the interaction of their partials. Forks can&apos;t get one<br/>closer than an approximation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;To say that strings are &quot;inharmonic&quot; (i.e. out of<br/>tune) just doesn&apos;t make sense.

I KNOW there is scientific basis of this,  I see it<br/>every day.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Moreover, the forks worked for me. I just<br/>don&apos;t have your prejudice against ET and since I was playing Chopin I<br/>don&apos;t think there&apos;s any axe to grind over whether or not that is what<br/>the composer intended. &gt;&gt;</p><p>    I make a good living from tuning equal temperament in recording,<br/>performance, and broadcast venues.  For me, it is a tool, nothing more. It is<br/>certainly an ideal from the scientific perspective, but musically, it is simply the<br/>result of an average.  If we had been born with 20 fingers and huge hands, I<br/>don&apos;t think ET would have been more than a passing fancy on the way to 19 ET or<br/>something else.  There is nothing magical about a 14 cent third, and there is<br/>something stultifying about having them all the same.<br/>   Chopin in ET is rather bland when compared with something like the Moore &amp;<br/>Co. tuning or Broadwood tunings that Jorgensen has published.  There is a<br/>difference when the texture of a varied and highly tempered harmony supports a<br/>melodic line of pure fifths, and this doesn&apos;t happen in ET.  Chopin&apos;s choice of<br/>key also exhibits a strong correlation to the ascending dissonance found in<br/>well-temperaments.  This correlation is exactly opposite of Beethoven and<br/>Mozart&apos;s.<br/>   I have even recorded Chopin on a DeMorgan tuning, which is the reverse of<br/>the normal well-temperament format, and I think it is even blander than ET!<br/>ET isn&apos;t as damaging for Chopin as it is for Beethoven, Haydn, etal,  but once<br/>an ear has become familiar with the WT palette, the increase in brilliance and<br/>contrast found in a WT does wonderful things for Chopin&apos;s music.

Now I hope to work with dynamically retuned JI and related<br/>&gt; stuff, which I am sure I could also combine with live performace too.<br/>&gt; Maybe I&apos;m just a different kind of purist to you.</p><p>If you are a purist you may be disappointed to discover just how &quot;impure&quot;<br/>the piano is, that there is no such thing as accurately tuning a piano, that<br/>there is no such thing as a just interval on the piano.  However in spite of<br/>this it is possible to get adequately close for many listening purposes, and<br/>by knowing the problems to achieve much better results.  But this pretty<br/>much puts purism out of the picture.</p><p>Chances are that if your yamaha sounds anything like a piano at all, that it<br/>has plenty of inharmonicity built in, probably by using samples of many<br/>seconds in length such that many cycles of the fundamental and of all<br/>partial are present.  Trying to do the same thing with a single cycle of a<br/>piano waveform would be impossible because there is no such thing as a<br/>single cycle of a piano waveform.  Never mind the fact that a piano sample<br/>might also want the unisons to be off a little, conceivably, because perfect<br/>unisons across the board would be probably unrepresentative of a realistic<br/>piano sound.  But it is not only for that reason that long samples are<br/>needed but probably more primarily so that the partials that are not exact<br/>harmonics can make their natural contribution.</p><p>The tuning of a piano to make use of the way non-harmonic partials interact<br/>is a deep art.  It is full of much possibility of different emphasis to<br/>achieve different effect.  It has very little to do with purity of any kind.<br/>A particular approach might refer to a particular kind of purity.  In some<br/>cases there may be objective realities that correlate with the individually<br/>identified kinds of purity.  Tuning fumdamentals would be one possible such<br/>approach, but it strikes me this approach would have only one kind of<br/>purity:  theoretical, except possibly by accident on a given kind of piano.</p><p>Much has been discussed about this and you might actually want to look<br/>through the archives.</p><p>Please take note of what you said a few posts back:</p><p>&gt; The tuning forks were ET. Therefore if the strings are equal to the<br/>&gt; forks then the strings are ET. You seem to be inventing difficulties<br/>&gt; that don&apos;t exist.</p><p>The didn&apos;t exist in your awareness, yes.</p><p>&gt; To say that strings are &quot;inharmonic&quot; (i.e. out of<br/>&gt; tune) just doesn&apos;t make sense.</p><p>To you, yes.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think there is any scientific basis to what you say.</p><p>So you don&apos;t think so.  Ok.</p><p>You took three sentences to reveal what you didn&apos;t know in the form of<br/>claimed (even if tentative) knowledge.  The alternative is to expose what<br/>you don&apos;t know directly, in the form of questions, which requires being<br/>savvy in advance to the fact that you might at any time encounter knowledge<br/>you weren&apos;t previously exposed to.  Mind you I don&apos;t think anyone is perfect<br/>at this.  We can be taken aback by our own assumptions particularly when we<br/>enter new arenas.</p><p>&gt; Moreover, the forks worked for me.</p><p>Now you are coming back to your own experience without claiming anything<br/>beyond that.  Still the experience of a piano that is tuned by a different<br/>method might be very revealing.  Knowing the territory and the vastness of<br/>the unknown and the degree of subjectivity it should be possible as a tuner<br/>to make *no* assumptions, while using a certain method merely as a<br/>&quot;question&quot; - a step in a dialog &quot;with the piano&quot; if you will.  This requires<br/>total openness about what may yet remain unknown.</p><p>[Kurt steps up on higher podium - disregard rest of message if you wish]</p><p>Mind you I still make similar mistakes.  But the awareness that I might<br/>always be mistaken, if it becomes more familiar rather than being forgotten<br/>until the next &quot;incident&quot;, can help dialogs to proceed with more directness,<br/>less presumption, and less consequent irritation to others.  Not that others<br/>need to be irritated either, especially if they remember making similar<br/>mistakes themselves.  Carl was very generous with you, and if he was<br/>irritated, I think he took responsibility for it and contained it entirely.</p><p>What I am hinting at here is the possibility of a meta-lesson, as opposed to<br/>simply a long series of lessons marked by presumption followed by<br/>revelation.  If you were to plot a line which represented your net<br/>experience I think you would see less discontinuity (less disruption) and<br/>therefore more effective integration.  All your knowledge &quot;corners&quot; nicely<br/>with you as you enter a curve (a state of questioning) and you do not have<br/>to spin out and get back on the road again as a separate step.</p><p>So if someone says something that strikes you as absurd or wrong or<br/>unlikely, why not simply assume first that it is your knowledge that is<br/>lacking, and start asking questions in order to determine that?  I think<br/>there is considerable value to this.  I would say it reduces the noise-level<br/>in the communication.  Every time the noise level drops a notch, another<br/>possible refinement may be revealed, so that we start developing the art of<br/>communicating, instead of leaving communication in the form of a sparring<br/>match with a lot of brusk transitions and reduced sense of continuity.</p><p>The &quot;goal&quot; might be to replace the knee-jerk response to make statements<br/>when different points of view come up with an innate response to ask<br/>questions.  The questioning response might *actually* be the older and more<br/>innate one, and thus inherently familiar and confortable once it is<br/>rediscovered.  I will be very interested to hear what you discover if you<br/>try this and find how it works for you.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 10:22:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;And since, as I said previously, it was a timber-frame piano<br/>&gt;&gt;that I was tuning the niceties would have been purely academic<br/>&gt;&gt;anyway.

However, as you say it is only<br/>when<br/>&gt; the beats *begin* to disappear, not when they have actually<br/>&gt; disappeared. When no beats whatsoever is present, or when the beat<br/>is<br/>&gt; of such a low frequency as to be indetectable, then to all intents<br/>&gt; and purposes the two sources are identical or prefectly in tune.&lt;&lt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Hmm,  I think your intents and purposes might allow a little<br/>more<br/>&gt; tolerance than mine.  You will not get a professional level ET by<br/>matching<br/>&gt; fundamentals to forks, (at least, not on more than one particular<br/>instrument, since<br/>&gt; the inharmonicity varies between sizes and brands).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sault again:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The tuning forks were ET. Therefore if the strings are equal to<br/>the<br/>&gt; forks then the strings are ET. You seem to be inventing<br/>difficulties<br/>&gt; that don&apos;t exist. &lt;&lt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Oh, the difficulties exist, I work with them daily.  &quot;Strings are<br/>equal to<br/>&gt; forks&quot; isn&apos;t descriptive, because forks don&apos;t produce the spectra<br/>that strings<br/>&gt; do.  All the fork will do is place a fundamental, but the tempering<br/>of<br/>&gt; intervals is measured by the interaction of their partials. Forks<br/>can&apos;t get one<br/>&gt; closer than an approximation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;To say that strings are &quot;inharmonic&quot; (i.e. out of<br/>&gt; tune) just doesn&apos;t make sense. I don&apos;t think there is any<br/>scientific<br/>&gt; basis to what you say. &lt;&lt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The frequencies produced by strings are inharmonic, which is the<br/>term used<br/>&gt; to describe the non-linear departure from even mulitples of the<br/>fundamental<br/>&gt; that the partials exhibit.  I KNOW there is scientific basis of<br/>this,  I see it<br/>&gt; every day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Moreover, the forks worked for me. I just<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have your prejudice against ET and since I was playing Chopin<br/>I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think there&apos;s any axe to grind over whether or not that is<br/>what<br/>&gt; the composer intended. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     I make a good living from tuning equal temperament in<br/>recording,<br/>&gt; performance, and broadcast venues.  For me, it is a tool, nothing<br/>more. It is<br/>&gt; certainly an ideal from the scientific perspective, but musically,<br/>it is simply the<br/>&gt; result of an average.  If we had been born with 20 fingers and huge<br/>hands, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think ET would have been more than a passing fancy on the way<br/>to 19 ET or<br/>&gt; something else.  There is nothing magical about a 14 cent third,<br/>and there is<br/>&gt; something stultifying about having them all the same.<br/>&gt;    Chopin in ET is rather bland when compared with something like<br/>the Moore &amp;<br/>&gt; Co. tuning or Broadwood tunings that Jorgensen has published.<br/>There is a<br/>&gt; difference when the texture of a varied and highly tempered harmony<br/>supports a<br/>&gt; melodic line of pure fifths, and this doesn&apos;t happen in ET.<br/>Chopin&apos;s choice of<br/>&gt; key also exhibits a strong correlation to the ascending dissonance<br/>found in<br/>&gt; well-temperaments.  This correlation is exactly opposite of<br/>Beethoven and<br/>&gt; Mozart&apos;s.<br/>&gt;    I have even recorded Chopin on a DeMorgan tuning, which is the<br/>reverse of<br/>&gt; the normal well-temperament format, and I think it is even blander<br/>than ET!<br/>&gt; ET isn&apos;t as damaging for Chopin as it is for Beethoven, Haydn,<br/>etal,  but once<br/>&gt; an ear has become familiar with the WT palette, the increase in<br/>brilliance and<br/>&gt; contrast found in a WT does wonderful things for Chopin&apos;s music.<br/>To some, it<br/>&gt; makes no difference, to others, it is very evident.<br/>&gt; Ed Foote RPT<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html">http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/>&gt;  &lt;A<br/>HREF=&quot;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a><br/>&quot;&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>: Six Degrees of Tonality&lt;/A&gt;</p><p>Do you have a reference?

The primary problem is that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; matching unisons is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather imprecise method.  The closer the note approaches the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; standard, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less information there is for the tuner to use, ie, the beats<br/>&gt; &gt; begin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to slow down<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and at some point, disappear.  When this happens, the tuner<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; unable, without<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further checks, to tell if they are slightly sharp or flat<br/>&gt; from<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; standard.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter Wakefield Sault responds:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I am aware of this difficulty. However, as you say it is only<br/>&gt; &gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the beats *begin* to disappear, not when they have actually<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; disappeared. When no beats whatsoever is present, or when the<br/>&gt; beat<br/>&gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of such a low frequency as to be indetectable, then to all<br/>&gt; intents<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and purposes the two sources are identical or prefectly in<br/>&gt; tune.&lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;       Hmm,  I think your intents and purposes might allow a<br/>&gt; little<br/>&gt; &gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tolerance than mine.  You will not get a professional level ET<br/>&gt; by<br/>&gt; &gt; matching<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentals to forks, (at least, not on more than one<br/>&gt; particular<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument, since<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the inharmonicity varies between sizes and brands).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sault again:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The tuning forks were ET. Therefore if the strings are equal<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; forks then the strings are ET. You seem to be inventing<br/>&gt; &gt; difficulties<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that don&apos;t exist. &lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;   Oh, the difficulties exist, I work with them daily.  &quot;Strings<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; equal to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; forks&quot; isn&apos;t descriptive, because forks don&apos;t produce the<br/>&gt; spectra<br/>&gt; &gt; that strings<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; do.  All the fork will do is place a fundamental, but the<br/>&gt; tempering<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals is measured by the interaction of their partials.<br/>&gt; Forks<br/>&gt; &gt; can&apos;t get one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; closer than an approximation.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;To say that strings are &quot;inharmonic&quot; (i.e. out of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tune) just doesn&apos;t make sense. I don&apos;t think there is any<br/>&gt; &gt; scientific<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; basis to what you say. &lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;    The frequencies produced by strings are inharmonic, which is<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; term used<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to describe the non-linear departure from even mulitples of the<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamental<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the partials exhibit.  I KNOW there is scientific basis of<br/>&gt; &gt; this,  I see it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; every day.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Moreover, the forks worked for me. I just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t have your prejudice against ET and since I was playing<br/>&gt; Chopin<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t think there&apos;s any axe to grind over whether or not that<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the composer intended. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     I make a good living from tuning equal temperament in<br/>&gt; &gt; recording,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; performance, and broadcast venues.

It is<br/>possible to extrapolate from this explanation that while there may<br/>not have been any standards in terms of frequency until the 18th<br/>century, frequencies can, however, be calculated from measured beats<br/>in the following manner, using the Law of Pythagoras. If two strings<br/>of equal gauge under equal tension are set up to have an interval of,<br/>say, 199:200 by setting their lengths to that proportion and the<br/>resulting beat is measured by pendulum to be 2Hz then we can know<br/>that the respective frequencies of the two vibrations are 398Hz and<br/>400Hz. Having ascertained this then, also by the Law of Pythagoras,<br/>we can calculate the vibration number of any length of string of the<br/>same gauge under the same tension. That Pythagoras, and his<br/>predecessors for that matter, knew they were dealing with vibrations<br/>is undeniable since the vibrations of a string can be observed with<br/>the eye sufficiently well, especially at low frequencies, to be able<br/>to see what is going on.

To<br/>have to<br/>&gt; wade through 100&apos;s of posts called &quot;odien 1-003&quot; but find there are<br/>100&apos;s of<br/>&gt; ideas presented is very time consuming....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just a thought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Aaron.</p><p>Perhaps Yahoo! can be persuaded to add an indexing function to<br/>discussion groups. The Internet is part of the problem here - there&apos;s<br/>just too much happening too fast. As I commented when I first joined<br/>the group, it would be impossible for me to wade through 49,000 posts<br/>to get &apos;up to date&apos; with everything. And who would want me or anyone<br/>asking questions about post #1234? If a set of index words could be<br/>defined, thus excluding all except musicological and/or technical<br/>terms then a meaningful index could be auto-generated. It would also,<br/>or alternatively, be good to have a group search facility, whereby<br/>all 49,000 posts could be searched for a keyword or keywords. Again,<br/>that would be down to Yahoo!. I am sure they would respond favourably<br/>to such a request although it may take some time for them to<br/>implement it.</p><p>Google responded favourably to my request for a &apos;translate more&apos;<br/>button in their language services, which presently cut of after the<br/>first 1500 words, leaving one excluded from the rest of a text.<br/>However, once again, it will be a while before such a facility<br/>arrives.</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2003 1:31:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/14/03 8:10 PM, monz &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; hi Johnny, Kurt, and Peter,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; In a message dated 12/14/03 6:47:16 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>&gt;&gt; sault@c... writes:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I do not believe that Pythagoras<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; was the inventor of the monochord - I think it highly<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; likely that he brought one back from Babylon.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I think you are correct, maybe older still, if that&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; possible.

Of<br/>course there is a little spam problem there - the system would need to<br/>provide accounts and passwords.

CET+1</p><p>&quot;De Amerikaanse celliste Frances-Marie Uitti improviseert al vanaf haar<br/>jeugd. In de zeventiger jaren zoekt ze een manier om de harmonische<br/>mogelijkheden van de cello te vergroten en vindt de speelwijze met twee<br/>strijkstokken uit. De improvisaties die ze daarmee in de periode 1985-1994<br/>maakt resulteren in de CD &quot;2 Bows&quot; op het label BVHaast. Veel zijn traag en<br/>meditatief van karakter en belichten alle kanten van de klank zoals die met<br/>een strijkstok teweeg gebracht kan worden.<br/>Vanwege haar talent schrijven bekende componisten zoals Scelsi, Kurt&aacute;g,<br/>Nono, Andriessen, Bussotti en Cage werken voor haar. Verder is muziek te<br/>horen die ze maakte in duo&apos;s met Jonathan Harvey, Mark Dresser en Stephen<br/>Vitiello. Ze is vaak op tournee, geeft gastdocentschappen en is bezig met<br/>een boek over hedendaagse strijktechnieken.&quot;</p><p>It can also be received on the internet, go to<br/><a href="http://www.concertzender.nl">http://www.concertzender.nl</a> and click on &quot;Live audio&quot;.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2005 1:14:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monday 7 Feb, Concertzender, 20-22 h.
