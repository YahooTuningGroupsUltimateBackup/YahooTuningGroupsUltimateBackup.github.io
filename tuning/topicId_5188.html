The product property _is_ required to get his three group-theoretic<br/>&gt;representations of the pitch set -- melodic, key, and harmonic. Since the<br/>&gt;title of his paper is _The Group-theoretic Description of 12-fold and<br/>&gt;Microtonal Pitch Systems_, and he gives these representations a huge amount<br/>&gt;of emphasis in his paper, there&apos;s no way you can exclude them from the list<br/>&gt;of &quot;all the things he says he wants&quot;.</p><p>If I say coffee is all I want, it shouldn&apos;t be surprising that only coffee<br/>will do.  Balzano&apos;s paper is full of this sort of &apos;if A, then A&apos; stuff; I<br/>wish I had the time to quote it all here.  At the beginning of the paper he<br/>promises musical justification for his criteria.  I re-read the paper, and<br/>I still didn&apos;t see it.  When it comes time to prove the product property,<br/>he gives an excuse -- depends on how you formulate the properties.</p><p>It wasn&apos;t my intent to summarize the paper, it was my intent to summarize<br/>everything I felt he justified.  I did miss the bit about the generator<br/>transformations causing the one note to change a _small amount_ with<br/>respect to the 2nds of the scale; so we only consider chains which are 1D<br/>periodicity blocks of the type you&apos;re looking for.  But then, all of a<br/>sudden, the small amount has to be one unit of the master scale, to get<br/>homomorphism with the semitone-generated group.  Product-space spanning<br/>groups are thrown out when their semitone versions aren&apos;t isomers.  Nonsense.</p><p>The paper was interesting, benevolent, and pointed out some important<br/>properties of the diatonic scale.  But its conclusions are hogwash.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=5197 href="#5197">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
