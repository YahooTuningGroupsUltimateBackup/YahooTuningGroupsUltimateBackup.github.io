I think the<br/>first and last samples are subharmonic singing. (Actually<br/>not so sure about the last one on re-listening but first<br/>one still sounds pretty much like it has it in there).</p><p>At least some of the ones in between are precussion sounds<br/>but I wouldn&apos;t be able to say which. I think at least one marimba<br/>like istrument, and kind of cymbals like instrument, and a very<br/>resonant kind of a drum, like a conga or whatever, but couldn&apos;t be<br/>more specific. Surely you have the actual crickets playing<br/>much of the time, or is that just you being clever in how you<br/>manipulate them all? Actually on re-listening, maybe they aren&apos;t<br/>actually there at all. I can&apos;t hear a single sample that is definitely<br/>insect like on closest attention!</p><p>Actually I only know crickets from recordings, as we don&apos;t have<br/>them in England, or if they are here somewhere, they are very rare, in fact the<br/>insects and frogs make no sound at all here most of the time,<br/>except occasional grashopper in summer. The frogs croak so rarely<br/>I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve ever heard one except in a recording. However<br/>the birds more than make up for it with our wonderful dawn chorus<br/>especially in spring / early summer.</p><p>One sounds a bit like a train, and one like applause. Of course<br/>not just one sample at a time, but several in parallel, all<br/>different. What with the way you use it in Galunlati, there will<br/>surely be shortwave static in there somewhere too.</p><p>robert</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>8/6/2001 6:51:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Guys</p><p>Like Jacky I live surrounded by the sound of crickets all summer<br/>long, and  always, no matter how hot, open the window at night to<br/>fall asleep to their sound.  I like Jacky&apos;s chord very much because<br/>that is close to how it sounds down here by the Gulf.</p><p>Anyway intrigued by the sleep qualities I am going to do a first, for<br/>me, and present some math!!  Now please don&apos;t run away :-)</p><p>If you take the frequencies Jacky found through actual<br/>experimentation, and bring them down to the level of brain waves by<br/>diving by 512 (2^9) you get</p><p>5.481161133  hz<br/>7.217052539  hz<br/>9.648332617  hz</p><p>13.3892498   hz<br/>14.6077709   hz</p><p>Voila , the first three frequencies are all in the theta range which<br/>is correlated with dreams and creativity , the next is alpha which is<br/>associated with relaxation.  Only one is in the beta range.  In other<br/>words the crickets are making harmonics compatible with sleep and<br/>dreaming.</p><p>Here is a reference for brainwaves and frequencies.</p><p><a href="http://www.cybermart.com.sg/eisho/bwha.htm">http://www.cybermart.com.sg/eisho/bwha.htm</a></p><p>I suspect that brainwave induction has something to do with the<br/>pleasantness of the piece, and it would probably be very cool for<br/>meditation and trance induction.</p><p>Personally I plan to play with the tuning becuase any time you get<br/>someone into a theta state it is also associated with healing.  I was<br/>a little disappointed I didn&apos;t find the Schumann resonance (7.83 hz)<br/>but hey - thats the value of experimental data.</p><p>Please feel free to blast my mathematical analysis - it is a first<br/>for me!</p><p>And Jacky thank you for the piece, and tuning.  I did not get a<br/>chance to hear the recent pieces that Jon Santo praised.  Could you<br/>repost them, or just send them on.</p><p>Mary</p></div>
