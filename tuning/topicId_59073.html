The medieval modes were ordered according to four possible finales and their relative compass. They had primary and secondary recitation tones (sometimes called &quot;dominants&quot;, another potentially confusing term) assigned, had a number of possible opening notes, melodic gambits, and a mood. In polyphonic music, this system was eroded because authentic and plagal pairs were used together, the fifth and the third were admitted as last notes in a part &amp;c. Part of this erosion history is Glarean&apos;s Dodekachordon, where he describes the eight church modes on D, E, F, and G and adds four more, on C and A. He named them all and two more modes on B after Greek tribes. (Probably he also considered the F modes ((Hypo-)Lydian) to have a raised fourth degree, whereas the resulting tritone would have been avoided in earlier music.)</p><p>The other meaning came about in the last half century seems immensely more popular and less meaningful. For the description of tonal music, Glareans names were used to describe scales built on the diatonic chords of major; superfluous names in my opinion that ring scientic. Functional harmonic theory just called these &quot;the nth degree of&quot; - and then you didn&apos;t even have to alter the mode names if you were describing minor. For these I proposed &quot;rotation&quot;. Not the term itself, mind you, which came from a posting by Dave Keenan, only its use for the &quot;modern&quot; meaning of &quot;mode&quot;.</p><p>Yahya and I were satisfied with our definitions as far as they went; if you have questions or different ideas, please ask end discauss them.</p><p>kalus<br/>Please ask if anything</p></div><h3><a id=59076 href="#59076">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2005 12:11:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The other meaning came about in the last half century seems immensely<br/>&gt; more popular and less meaningful.</p><p>It&apos;s been used that way longer than that--I learned my first theory<br/>from Redfield, which dates to the 40s at least as my mother had it as<br/>a college textbook.

His method generally was breaking something down into its elements (the diatonic scale into 2 semitones and 5 whole tones) and reassembling them in various ways. The following quote is either about Schillinger&apos;s teachings themselves or from a draft of a course curriculum at Schillinger House: (<a href="http://www.berklee.edu/bt/122/connection.html">http://www.berklee.edu/bt/122/connection.html</a>)</p><p>&gt; The material points out that the familiar Western European system<br/>&gt; of diatonic harmony is just the tip of the iceberg since, according<br/>&gt; to Schillinger, any scale can form the basis of a &quot;diatonic&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;symmetric&quot; system from which characteristic intervals and chords<br/>&gt; may be derived.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=59088 href="#59088">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2005 3:19:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   and used this meaning<br/>&gt; &gt; for the church modes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could you expand on that?
