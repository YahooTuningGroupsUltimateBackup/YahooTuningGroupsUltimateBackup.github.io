Have you thought of<br/>&gt; ways to make a number of inharmonic instruments sound more harmonious<br/>&gt; as an ensemble?</p><p>Seems from recent posts that one way to do that is to find the partials of the instrument<br/>and then use that to construct a scale, and try playing in it.</p><p>In fact, in a way, that is what this piece does, except that there is an extra<br/>step of also making the timbre out of instruments playing the partials.</p><p>I can certainly do more of that. Any recommendations of other sites<br/>that will have lists of partials, or do you have any? I may easily have<br/>missed the posts if you have posted them to the TL (I remember<br/>scales generated in some way from the partials, but don&apos;t think<br/>you said they were the partials themselves - or were they?)</p><p>I&apos;ve been updating FTS to make it much easier to enter the partials<br/>to make a timbre - now you just need the list of frequencies or cents,<br/>and the list of volumes, paste each one into the relevant box,<br/>and there you are - the inharmonic timbre as a custom voice<br/>all ready to play. Then you can select / re-select the voice<br/>you want to use to play all the partials with one click as well.</p><p>(Ready for next upload, but I&apos;m doing several things at once, so<br/>not sure when exactly it will be ready)</p><p>Constructing scales is easy, but not sure how to find the partials of the<br/>timbres I&apos;ve got on my soundcard.</p><p>I can use soundfonts on my soundcard as well, and have also downloaded the<br/>free version of AudioCompositor which makes sound files at 22 hz,<br/>which can use lots of formats, and render the sounds to a file, which will b<br/>fine for making lo-fi samples to try out the idea. So some time will be nice to<br/>spend a while playing around with it and seeing what I can do.</p><p>Of course, anyone else can try this out in FTS as well, and it will get<br/>easier and easier to do it as I add more options to FTS.</p><p>Best will be if I can get FTS to do the FFT for any timbre you ask it to play,<br/>then whole thing will be done in one place. I&apos;ll have to see how easy it is to<br/>program FFT. (it&apos;s on my wish list for FTS 1.10)</p><p>&gt; My favorite blend with inharmonic timbres - as said before - is the<br/>&gt; human voice.
