More specifically, many Arab<br/>musicians agree that &grave;iraq-rast should be a smallish<br/>neutral second, say around 130-145 cents, with one<br/>view heard among Arab musicians and reported by Scott<br/>Marcus suggesting that the size tends to become a bit<br/>narrower as one moves from Egypt to Palestine or<br/>Lebanon, and from there to Iraq or Syria.</p><p>Maqam &grave;Iraq makes this step called &grave;iraq, a neutral<br/>second below rast, its final or resting note. Just as<br/>Maqam Hijaz has a name referring to the Hijaz region,<br/>but is known and performed in various parts of<br/>the Arab world (not to mention Turkey!), so Maqam &grave;Iraq<br/>likewise. Here&apos;s one possible tuning which follows a<br/>view of some Arab theory that we can derive Maqam &grave;Iraq<br/>by rotation, that is, simply by starting at &grave;iraq and<br/>moving through the same steps and intervals as in the<br/>premier Maqam Rast.</p><p>   0    138     342    498      636    840    1044   1200<br/>&grave;iraq   rast   dukah  segah  jaharkah  nawa  huseyni  awj<br/>     138    204     156    138      204    204     156</p><p>Here I&apos;m using steps almost identical to those of<br/>Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim or 203.9-138.6-155.6 cents<br/>(9:8-13:12-128:117), in a different permutation of<br/>course, to give an idea of how the maqam _might_<br/>be tuned in some parts of the Arab world by some<br/>musicians. Actual measurements from different regions<br/>would be very interesting!</p><p>My purpose here isn&apos;t to go into the actually much<br/>more intricate structure of Maqam &grave;Iraq in its ascending<br/>and descending forms, only to give a general idea of<br/>what this maqam signifies for Arab musicians generally<br/>(with many shades of tuning, of course).</p><p>In contrast, Iraqi Maqam embraces the amazingly diverse<br/>maqamat of the Iraqi tradition, a topic which I&apos;m just<br/>setting out to learn more about. All the Persian names<br/>definitely have whet my appetite, not to mention some<br/>Turkish names that I haven&apos;t noticed in some other<br/>regional Arab practices (or at least the incomplete<br/>accounts I&apos;ve read, a healthy qualification!).</p><p>Curiously, while one listing on the Web of the<br/>Iraqi repertoire does mention &grave;Iraq as one of the<br/>maqamat, it&apos;s not prominently listed; however, it<br/>often comes up in Arab music generally as a member<br/>of the Sikah family, and so might possibly appear<br/>in Iraqi performances of Maqam Sikah (or Sigah as<br/>transliterated on at least one site), one of the<br/>principal Iraqi maqamat, something about which I&apos;d<br/>like to learn more.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
