Formed in August of 2001, Firebird is fast<br/>achieving a reputation for dynamic performances, innovative programming<br/>and an infectious sense of fun. Returning from their recent and highly<br/>successful New York debut in February, where the New York Times described<br/>their performance as &quot;ambitious and eclectic&quot; with &quot;an improvisatory<br/>spirit&quot;, Firebird concludes their second concert season with an adventurous<br/>program of microtonal music presented by the Boston Microtonal Society.</p><p>ABOUT THE BOSTON MICROTONAL SOCIETY<br/>The Boston Microtonal Society was founded in 1988 by renowned composer,<br/>jazz saxophonist and New England Conservatory professor Joe Maneri, in<br/>order to promote the composition, performance and study of microtonal music.<br/>In addition to its various educational activities, the BMS has developed an<br/>enthusiastic following over the years with its unusual and fascinating<br/>concert series. This concert season the Boston Microtonal Society is very<br/>proud to announce its new collaborations with Boston&apos;s Firebird Ensemble<br/>and New York&apos;s Wet Ink Musics. In April and May of 2003 each group will be<br/>presenting both a Boston and a New York performance of its own microtonal<br/>concert program - totaling four performances.</p><p>(For more information about these concerts, other BMS activities, and<br/>microtonal music and musicians, please visit our website at:<br/><a href="http://BostonMicrotonalSociety.org">http://BostonMicrotonalSociety.org</a>)</p></div>
