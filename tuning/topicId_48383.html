Couper was Harry Partch&apos;s savior in the 30&apos;s while<br/>he was on the road and stopped by her Santa Barbara home.   She knew Cowell<br/>(Xanadu was premiered on the same concert that the Rhythmicon was unveiled),<br/>Boulanger and Stravinsky.   She heard Ives&apos; Three 1/4 tone pieces in the 1920s and<br/>wrote at least 4 pieces in 24TET.   They are gnarly, exciting and very<br/>&quot;pianistic&quot;.   Maybe they will now become standard rep...</p><p>They appear on the CD If Tigers Were Clouds: Eight Decades of Women in<br/>Experimental Music played by Zeitgeist on the innova label.</p><p>Details:<br/><a href="http://www.innova.mu/artist1.asp?skuID=36">http://www.innova.mu/artist1.asp?skuID=36</a></p><p>Philip</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2003 3:34:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>P,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, PhilipBla@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Mildred Couper fans everywhere will be glad to know two of her pieces for two<br/>&gt; pianos tuned 1/4 tone apart have now been recorded, 73 years after their<br/>&gt; premiere: Xanadu and Dirge.</p><p>Better late than never!</p><p>I hope people on the tuning list realize what a good thing it is to have Philip Blackburn join the mix.
