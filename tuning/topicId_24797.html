(David Doty at the JI Network website, under<br/>&quot;What is Just Intonation,&quot; Horst-Peter Hesse, and others.) Their line is<br/>more-or-less: &quot;The masses never did like atonal music anyway, and we have an<br/>scientific explanation why. Atonal composers [and many of them of course<br/>include all the tonal composers who have ever written for 12-note ET] deny<br/>us what &apos;nature&apos; has intended for us to hear. What they do is unatural and<br/>not legitimate.&quot;</p><p>You don&apos;t say this, but many of them do, like Stamm.</p><p>I suspect many of them are reacting to the veneer of elitism that so<br/>frequently seems to permeate the world of the atonal composers (the<br/>successful ones), or to frustration and resentment over their inability to<br/>enjoy or understand atonal music. But what they are doing with these<br/>statements - trying to use &quot;scientific&quot; arguments to prove generations of<br/>artists wrong, to invalidate their art - feels inhuman, sort-of fascistic to<br/>me. (In addition to being simply a bogus argument. You&apos;ll read more about<br/>this view in my essay.)

I only know Julie<br/>Werntz from your recent discussions on-list with 72 and Maneri/NEC<br/>(am I remembering correctly?). Stamms - don&apos;t know. Hesse - only<br/>Hermann.</p><p>My word! People like JI; other people like other tunings. &quot;genocidal<br/>IN SPIRIT&quot;?</p><p>Either I need more of the context of the paper/quotes to see just how<br/>they figure Doty and other JI proponants do it *to the detrimant*<br/>(sp?) of others, or some other explanation.</p><p>Either that, or people have been completely ineffective at producing<br/>the only thing that would trump a &quot;JI is Supreme&quot; card, which is a<br/>large body of music (not papers, not dissertations, etc.) that would<br/>give listeners a choice, and one that would undeniably be chosen as<br/>non-JI.</p><p>If you have other examples to send me, fine. If they revolve around<br/>1/1, David Doty, or anything related to that particular small pocket<br/>of the world, thanks but you can hold off: I&apos;ve read many of the 1/1<br/>issues, just as I have perused the Xenharmonicon issues, and I don&apos;t<br/>see the attack-oriented nature that you (and apparantly others) seem<br/>to. My only guess, since I don&apos;t care about one particular tuning one<br/>way or another, is that people just aren&apos;t confident in what they can<br/>produce. Or something similar. I can&apos;t explain it any other way.</p><p>Thanks for attempting to focus the situation. If for some reason I<br/>should know more about the music and/or performance of Ms. Werntz,<br/>please fill me in.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=24816 href="#24816">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 5:02:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JSZANTO@A... wrote:<br/>&gt; Stamms - don&apos;t know.</p><p>Hans-Andre Stamm.

Mixing in the anti-atonality stuff is only going to serve to<br/>muddy the waters. I want to keep on-point.</p><p>&gt; All the arguments, found in Partch</p><p>Who did his research how long ago?

He just did his own thing, and would, if he were alive,<br/>counsel Jule to do the exact same thing: find her own way.</p><p>&gt; . . . in Stamm&apos;s case, the statement that 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s academic<br/>&gt; music was a dead end . . . you can see how some people might be<br/>&gt; hurt by such statements.</p><p>At this point in time? All she&apos;d have to do is look at the body<br/>of &quot;academic music&quot; composed and performed to this point vs. any form<br/>of recent JI (or non-12tET, for that matter!) -- who is the clear<br/>winner? Heck, she could laugh the guy off if she wanted to!</p><p>&gt; Using arguments wrapped in &quot;science&quot; to marginalize someone or some<br/>&gt; group . . . that reminded her of eugenics. Personally, I<br/>&gt; disagreed with her reaction . . . but it was her reaction.</p><p>Well, it is too big a stretch for my tastes, and killing people is<br/>way too far an analogy than someone&apos;s purported support/non-support<br/>of a tuning system.</p><p>About composing non-JI music:<br/>&gt; Huh? What are you saying?</p><p>I&apos;m just saying that if they (I hate saying &quot;they&quot;, but I mean ET or<br/>non-JI opinions like Julie&apos;s) feel the scientific arguments don&apos;t<br/>wash, and feel steam-rollered by JI and it&apos;s adherents (sp?), then a<br/>good body of convincing pieces would suit their &apos;cause&apos; more than<br/>papers refuting the science. But some people, I&apos;ll admit, might be<br/>more swayed by papers than by music -- an age-old discussion we&apos;ve<br/>had here. I imagine your writings would go a long way in this regard,<br/>and I myself imagine that the ideas of intervals within a few cents<br/>are close enough for human use in approximating *exact* JI intervals,<br/>etc.</p><p>But Julie (and others) could simply plug along, ignore the JI<br/>philistines and bullies, and compile a compelling group of musics<br/>that would stand any &quot;scientific&quot; arguement on it&apos;s (r)ear.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t -- I was simply forwarding Julie&apos;s remarks on the subject.<br/>&gt; She&apos;s reluctant to join the list because (surprise!) of the large<br/>&gt; volume.</p><p>OK, I understand. But I think Julie (not knowing her at all) should<br/>just go on doing what she is compelled to. Let us all be honest: no<br/>one today, in any form of music, is having to buck the tide the way<br/>many of the people that we draw from did. No one is rioting at<br/>premieres the way they did for Stravinski, because they don&apos;t care;<br/>no one is villifying Schoenberg and Webern and Varese, because their<br/>mode of atonality/serialism/etc has now been absorbed into the<br/>mainstream, at least in terms of no one putting up a fuss. (I bring<br/>in these people, in the classical realm, so that I don&apos;t have to rely<br/>*solely* on Partch, because people already think I&apos;m monophonic in<br/>this way, and he is obviously JI-centric).</p><p>But even though she might not like Partch, he didn&apos;t have any of the<br/>support all of us have: tools to work with, mailing lists to discuss,<br/>at least a semblance of instruments and instrumentalists to work<br/>with, a concert audience willing to accept something outside the<br/>boundaries of people sitting in chairs, playing music at an audience.</p><p>He just read stuff, figured out what worked for him, wrote the music,<br/>made the instruments, got concerts and presentations, etc etc ad<br/>nauseum for people (like you and me) who know. He, and the others<br/>like him, had reason to whine. But instead (or at the same time) he<br/>went out and *did* it, all the while incurring the wrath and apathy<br/>of an uncomprehending (is that a word) public and musical<br/>establishment.</p><p>He&apos;s just one example, and the one I know best. If he had written in<br/>129EDO and the rest of the story was the same, he&apos;d still be a good<br/>example, because the point is not the tuning, it&apos;s what you do with<br/>it.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=24832 href="#24832">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 6:50:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon.</p><p>Julie Werntz is a composer and is co-director of the Boston Microtonal Society.
