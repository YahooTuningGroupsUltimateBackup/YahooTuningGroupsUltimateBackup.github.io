Meru in the Wilson Archives are equal beating systems which for the last 7 or 8 years have been the only type of scales i seem to have explored.<br/>I Have on many occasions posted things related to these tunings.<br/>Most recently which seemed to go unnoticed or commented on were a list i compiled many of which are Wilson own plus some of my own here as far as generators.<br/>it was the lucy tuning that you commented to erv about the sound being so good made him look at the difference tones to notice how well they worked that made him look into it more.<br/>Although for years i had mentioned that it seemed that most african and indonesian tunings could be explained by such.<br/>here is a list of some generators<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/MERUcream.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/MERUcream.PDF</a><br/>I will put up the ones that Erv has already put up so one can tell who did what</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 1         &gt;   Date: Wed, 7 Sep 2005 14:46:28 +0100<br/>&gt;   From: Charles Lucy &lt;<a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Beats analysis of meantones etc. - links please.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am very pleased to see that an interest in the analysis of beat  &gt;frequencies is developing on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To my mind this could develop into a very useful way to examine  &gt;tunings, on the assumption that the &quot;allusive harmonics&quot; do actually  &gt;beat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would be very grateful if someone could post all the relevant links  &gt;to the various methods of calculation which are being proposed,<br/>&gt;so that I can explore any new (to me) ideas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Until recently, members of the various tuning lists have seemed less  &gt;than enthusiastic to even entertain the idea that the beat rates between<br/>&gt;frequencies are significant, unless they are at integer frequency  &gt;ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have experimented with many different mathematical models of this  &gt;phenomena over the years,<br/>&gt;and have often felt as though I was shouted down by the JI mob,  &gt;whenever I insisted that harmonics &quot;should&quot; beat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Let&apos;s really explore what is happening with beating from every  &gt;direction,<br/>&gt;for I am convinced that this is the most potentially productive  &gt;direction for future microtuning research.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
