The 3:2 above<br/>D is A+, and the 3:2 below A is D-.  It&apos;s all 5-limit JI.</p><p>As I stated in my previous post on this, the performer can only<br/>know when he has reached the proper tuning by having a previous<br/>understanding of exactly how the system of accidentals works.<br/>Then, he/she *checks* the intonation by the listening for the<br/>absence of beating, since Johnston almost always uses vertical<br/>sonorities that are Partchian o- or u-tonalities.  In other<br/>words, he hardly ever puts intervals like D:A in his music;<br/>a vertical chord would typically have a 3:2 of D-:A or D:A+.</p><p>Of course, Paul&apos;s arguement becomes valid if we&apos;re talking<br/>about Johnston&apos;s notation being used by another composer who<br/>*does* use these kinds of intervals (like if I used his notation<br/>for my music, for instance).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Additionally, how does a COMPOSER know which commas go<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; where?

There has been<br/>controversy with this book and Rudolf Rasch along similar lines.  There is<br/>the disappointment that the book does not show the relationship of notation<br/>to function, thereby sidestepping the important issues that are discussed on<br/>this list.</p><p>Actually, Gardner really was hunting down every single example of a unique<br/>notation tied to microtonal music that he could.  He stayed around the corner<br/>from me for 3 days, and he&apos;d visit with me to look over the archive and he<br/>included everything.  (Keep in mind that Gardner climbed my stairs in his<br/>90s).</p><p>If you want to see all she wrote from the photograph in time that is<br/>Gardner&apos;s book, it will be well worthwhile.  The bit about Partch is fully<br/>accurate.  There are for Read 43 items to be notated and suggests the<br/>following:</p><p>&quot;IThe ratio numbers chosen by Partch express their relationships to his<br/>so-called &quot;generating tone,&quot; which is one-line G (392 Hz).  From this note<br/>the composer constructed a &quot;resource bank&quot; of pitches (a more accurate term,<br/>one thinks, than &quot;scale&quot;) based on the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11,<br/>and their multiples.  By combining the resulting twenty-nine pitches obtained<br/>from the 3-limit (3/2, perfect fifth and 4/3, or (major sixth), and 6/5, or<br/>minor third, the 7-, 9-, and 11-limits--all in approximate equal<br/>temperament--and adding fourteen new pitches, also related to the generating<br/>tone of one-line G (1/1) and its octave, 2/1, Partch arrived at his 43-tone<br/>scale or resource bank.&quot;</p><p>Then Gardner Reed proceeds to give Partch&apos;s cents to ratios chart for the<br/>octave from Da Capo Press.  I think that Gardner compared Partch&apos;s 43 just<br/>with 43-tET and found that 29 pitches were musically interchangeable, while<br/>14 others were &quot;aliens from another planet&quot; new.  Keep in mind that Gardner<br/>Read is the internationally recognized notation specialist long before this<br/>book.  He&apos;s a fabulous composer, lyrical and romantic.</p><p>Now to a bassoon student.

Right off the<br/>top, I would like to say that I am casting no aspersions on the fine<br/>compositional work of BOTH David Doty and Kyle Gann.  In fact, I own<br/>the Doty CD &quot;Uncommon Practices.&quot;</p><p>The problem is this:  spread out in front of me I have YOUR book, the<br/>1/1 article of Daniel Wolf and two examples of compositions that I got<br/>from the Microfest, by Kyle Gann and David Doty.  These are BOTH in<br/>Ben Johnston&apos;s notation.</p><p>At the moment, I am rather fascinated by the IMPLICATIONS of the<br/>Johnston notation... the idea that somehow maybe a player could adjust<br/>his performance by one of the various commas indicated in the score.</p><p>This would, of course, be a much more AURAL process than writing some<br/>kind of cents notation.  The thought of this has me mesmerized at the<br/>moment.</p><p>HOWEVER, I am not fully convinced that a performer could do this.<br/>Maybe if the tempo were VERY slow, but how about in fast passages?</p><p>Does anybody know the success of Ben Johnston in making this happen<br/>with real, live instrumentalists??  Perhaps I need to know more about<br/>Johnston.</p><p>I met Johnston once, and he was actually not all that friendly. But<br/>neither was John Harbison... so much for that.</p><p>Anyway,  I OBVIOUSLY need more help with trying this out, and I am<br/>encountering many problems.  David Doty says I need a book that nobody<br/>has yet written...  I&apos;ve tried to get the &quot;gist&quot; of composing in his<br/>system from his scores that I have here but, so far, to no avail.</p><p>Kyle Gann&apos;s &quot;harmonic skeletons&quot; are MORE helpful.  At least I can get<br/>some kind of glimmer about what is going on and I know what the<br/>fundamental is... but I still would have problems putting it all<br/>together, if I wanted to write using this notation.</p><p>And THEN, there are the cloying problems cited by Daniel Wolf in his<br/>article in 1/1.  To quote:</p><p>&quot;The &apos;hybrid&apos; notations (for example, Ben Johnston&apos;s) substitute<br/>ratios with the factor five for the pure Pythagorean sequence and<br/>consequently lose the property of interval invariance.  Thus, without<br/>ancillary notation of the local &quot;tonic,&quot; the exact ratio of an<br/>interval is uncertain. [ED.-- DIS NO PLEASE ME MUCHO]  (In some<br/>contexts, an unmodified fifth D-A may have the ratio 3:2, in others<br/>40:27)...&quot;</p><p>This makes a &quot;doubting Thomas&quot; like me, well, doubt...</p><p>I&apos;m wondering if there is any book that could help me?  Does anybody<br/>know about the book available through the JI Network called _The Music<br/>of Ben Johnston_ by Heidi Von Gunden?  Does this have much about his<br/>notational system and PRACTICAL ways of composing with it??  At least<br/>maybe it tells about performances... (??)  I am STILL unconvinced that<br/>performers could really use this system even if a composer could<br/>figure it out.  For me, I would need some kind of charts or more<br/>systematic instruction in order to work practically with it.</p><p>It&apos;s not like I&apos;m &quot;well, isn&apos;t this theory interesting... now on to<br/>the next thing...&quot;  I would really want to understand it in order to<br/>COMPOSE with it, not just regard it as a curiosity...</p><p>The fact that Kyle Gann and David Doty BOTH use it extensively augurs<br/>well for it as a system.  HOWEVER, I am under the impression that BOTH<br/>of them use it MOSTLY with ELECTRONIC works!  I could be wrong, but<br/>that is the impression I have.  I have NO idea how much practical<br/>experience they have had with &quot;real&quot; performers with it...</p><p>Now on to at least a couple of specifics:</p><p>Monz, in your book you show the various alterations for the commas<br/>from the 5, 7 and 11 limit.</p><p>The 5-limit syntonic comma is obvious:  81:80 with the + and -</p><p>The 7-limit is clear with his use of 7&apos;s and inverted 7&apos;s:  36:35</p><p>AND, the 11-limit is the 33:32 with the arrows.</p><p>SO, what&apos;s the 25:24 all about??</p><p>See, I don&apos;t even know THIS much.  How am I going to compose with<br/>this...</p><p>I&apos;m going to keep studying over this stuff... but I really need some<br/>kind of systematic book or chart or some such, to get going with this.</p><p>AND, I&apos;m not even certain that players can play it or that it really<br/>&quot;works&quot; with the Wolf caveats.</p><p>This is a problem, man, a problem...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, Joe... wrong again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul is talking about the fact that the interval D:A (which is<br/>&gt; how I wish Paul had written it, to avoid confusion with Johnston&apos;s<br/>&gt; minus sign accidental) is not a 3:2, but a 40:27. The 3:2 above<br/>&gt; D is A+, and the 3:2 below A is D-.  It&apos;s all 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I stated in my previous post on this, the performer can only<br/>&gt; know when he has reached the proper tuning by having a previous<br/>&gt; understanding of exactly how the system of accidentals works.</p><p>Well, first the COMPOSER has to know it, and then he has to TEACH it<br/>to the performer.</p><p>Good luck to all concerned....</p><p>&gt; Then, he/she *checks* the intonation by the listening for the<br/>&gt; absence of beating, since Johnston almost always uses vertical<br/>&gt; sonorities that are Partchian o- or u-tonalities.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s the fascinating part, if it really works.</p><p>In other<br/>&gt; words, he hardly ever puts intervals like D:A in his music;<br/>&gt; a vertical chord would typically have a 3:2 of D-:A or D:A+.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, Paul&apos;s arguement becomes valid if we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; about Johnston&apos;s notation being used by another composer who<br/>&gt; *does* use these kinds of intervals (like if I used his notation<br/>&gt; for my music, for instance).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Additionally, how does a COMPOSER know which commas go<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where? Are there charts someplace of such?  Or is it something<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m supposed to already know??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are explanations of Johnston&apos;s notation with diagrams in:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - my book (JustMusic)</p><p>Monz.. this is only 4 pages!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; - David Doty&apos;s _Just Intonation Primer_, and _1/1_ articles</p><p>There is not enough in the JI Primer to help the composer with this...<br/>Doty admits it himself.  It just describes the system, as YOU do.</p><p>One would need a book with systematic charts and examples, or maybe<br/>personal study with Johnston, as Kyle Gann undertook....</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; - _Perspectives of New Music_ 1996</p><p>OK, I haven&apos;t seen this one...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Kyle Gann&apos;s website</p><p>I&apos;m not finding this on his site, and I don&apos;t remember it being on his<br/>site.

The thought of this has<br/>&gt; me mesmerized at the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HOWEVER, I am not fully convinced that a performer could do this.<br/>&gt; Maybe if the tempo were VERY slow, but how about in fast passages?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anybody know the success of Ben Johnston in making this<br/>&gt; happen with real, live instrumentalists??  Perhaps I need to<br/>&gt; know more about Johnston.</p><p>As I tried to emphasize in my previous post, Joe, Johnston has<br/>fairly good success with his method *because* the music he<br/>writes is permeated with vertical JI sonorities (o- and<br/>u-tonalities).</p><p>Therefore, once the performers understand both the notation<br/>and the compositional style, it&apos;s pretty easy to get decent<br/>results.  Of course, results vary widely depending on the<br/>performer...</p><p>I met Johnston in New York in (IIRC) December 1996, when Eric<br/>Grunen and a small orchestra performed his _Chamber Symphony_.<br/>I attended the rehearsal, and, while I was unfamiliar with the<br/>score previously, as I looked at it, it seemed to me that<br/>most of the performers were navigating the intonational field<br/>quite admirably.</p><p>The caveat in all this: Johnston&apos;s music assumes that 5-limit<br/>scale quoted above as its basis.  If your music doesn&apos;t do this<br/>(for example, mine frequently does not), then Johnston&apos;s notation<br/>will probably not work too well for your music.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if there is any book that could help me?  Does<br/>&gt; anybody know about the book available through the JI Network<br/>&gt; called _The Music of Ben Johnston_ by Heidi Von Gunden?  Does<br/>&gt; this have much about his notational system and PRACTICAL ways<br/>&gt; of composing with it??  At least maybe it tells about<br/>&gt; performances... (??)</p><p>Heidi&apos;s book is mostly a detailed overview of Johnston&apos;s life<br/>and music.  Since it does cover his compositions quite<br/>comprehensively, it can&apos;t help but have a lot to say about<br/>his notation.</p><p>But the best source for a deep understanding of Johnston&apos;s<br/>notation is the Fonville _Perspectives_ article.  (full citation<br/>given below)</p><p>If you&apos;re going to dig, it would also be useful to read<br/>Johnston&apos;s own initial articles on all this:</p><p>Johnston, Ben.  1964.<br/>&quot;Scalar Order as a Compositional Resource&quot;.<br/>_Perspectives of New Music_, vol 2 no 2 [Spring-Summer], p 56-76.</p><p>Johnston, Ben.  1966.<br/>&quot;Proportionality and Expanded Musical Pitch Relations&quot;.<br/>_Perspectives of New Music_, vol 5 no 1 [Fall-Winter], p 112-120.</p><p>You can get some philosphical background there that you won&apos;t<br/>find elsewhere.</p><p>&gt; I am STILL unconvinced that performers<br/>&gt; could really use this system even if a composer could figure<br/>&gt; it out.  For me, I would need some kind of charts or more<br/>&gt; systematic instruction in order to work practically with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not like I&apos;m &quot;well, isn&apos;t this theory interesting... now on to<br/>&gt; the next thing...&quot;  I would really want to understand it in order to<br/>&gt; COMPOSE with it, not just regard it as a curiosity...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fact that Kyle Gann and David Doty BOTH use it extensively<br/>&gt; augurs well for it as a system.  HOWEVER, I am under the<br/>&gt; impression that BOTH of them use it MOSTLY with ELECTRONIC<br/>&gt; works!  I could be wrong, but that is the impression I have.<br/>&gt; I have NO idea how much practical experience they have had<br/>&gt; with &quot;real&quot; performers with it...</p><p>Please keep in mind the caveat I wrote above.  Johnston&apos;s notation<br/>works very well for both Gann and Doty *because* they compose<br/>in JI, and that 5-limit basic scale really *is* a basic part of<br/>their musical vocabulary.</p><p>Based on what I know of your own compositions, Joe, it seems to<br/>me that the Wolf/Monzo Pythagorean-based notation would work<br/>better for you.  I&apos;ve never known any of your music to prominently<br/>feature 5-limit JI.  Based on the logical superiority of the<br/>Pythagorean-based approach, I think you would favor it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now on to at least a couple of specifics:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz, in your book you show the various alterations for the commas<br/>&gt; from the 5, 7 and 11 limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 5-limit syntonic comma is obvious:  81:80 with the + and -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 7-limit is clear with his use of 7&apos;s and inverted 7&apos;s:  36:35<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AND, the 11-limit is the 33:32 with the arrows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SO, what&apos;s the 25:24 all about??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See, I don&apos;t even know THIS much.  How am I going to compose with<br/>&gt; this...</p><p>I think it&apos;s because somehow you keep trying to relate it all<br/>to 12-tET, which won&apos;t work here.</p><p>Here&apos;s a quick tutorial:</p><p>Johnston&apos;s notation assumes that 7-tone 5-limit scale as its<br/>basis, which means that the 7 letter names with no other<br/>accidentals represent that scale: A B C D E F G.</p><p>The sharps and flats in Johnston&apos;s system represent an alteration<br/>of any of those 7 notes by a 25:24.  Thus, if C = 1/1, then<br/>C# = 25/24.  If E = 5/4, then Eb = 6/5.  Etc.</p><p>The big problem I have is that, after 5, all of Johnston&apos;s<br/>accidentals logically and consistently represent a *prime-factor*<br/>intonational inflection, but he muddled this distinction when<br/>dealing with prime-factors 3 and 5.  So the plusses and minuses<br/>(+/-) represent the 81:80 syntonic comma, but in a &quot;weird&quot;<br/>pattern than can really only be understood by invoking lattice<br/>visualizations.</p><p>It would be better to have the plain letters A B C D E F G<br/>to represent *only* prime-factor 3, as it already does<br/>historically in our standard notation.</p><p>Then, the sharps and flats would represent an inflection of<br/>2187:2048 (== 3^7), the usual Pythagorean &quot;chromatic semitone&quot;<br/>or &quot;apotome&quot;, again, as it already does historically in our<br/>standard notation.</p><p>The two advantages to this:</p><p>1)<br/>Elimination of the presence of prime-factor 5 in the sharps<br/>and flats, so that they only indicate intonational adjustments<br/>involving prime-factor 3, and so they too are on the same footing<br/>as all other accidentals.</p><p>2)<br/>The presence of a plus or minus *always* indicates the presence<br/>of prime-factor 5.  This puts the +/- accidentals on the same<br/>footing as all the others (for 7, 11, 13, etc.).</p><p>In Johnston&apos;s notation, both the #/b *and* +/- accidentals<br/>*always* indicate an adjustment which includes *both*<br/>prime-factors 3 and 5, because his basic scale includes both.<br/>This is my primary difficulty with his system.</p><p>Johnston&apos;s approach is fairly easy to conceptualize IF THE<br/>RESOURCES REMAIN FAIRLY SMALL, which is not the case even<br/>in his own music.</p><p>The Pythagorean-based approach is even simpler to conceptualize,<br/>but *MUCH* simpler to extend, because of its linearity, and<br/>because of the rigid consistency of its &quot;rules&quot; in regard to<br/>the meaning of accidentals.</p><p>&gt; &gt; [me, monz:]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then, he/she *checks* the intonation by the listening for the<br/>&gt; &gt; absence of beating, since Johnston almost always uses vertical<br/>&gt; &gt; sonorities that are Partchian o- or u-tonalities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that&apos;s the fascinating part, if it really works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other<br/>&gt; &gt; words, he hardly ever puts intervals like D:A in his music;<br/>&gt; &gt; a vertical chord would typically have a 3:2 of D-:A or D:A+.</p><p>The notation is adapted to the kind of music written by the<br/>composer who invented it.  Same as with Partch.  It works<br/>for Johnston, and for several other JI composers, but that<br/>doesn&apos;t automatically mean that it would be well-suited for<br/>you or anyone else.</p><p>&gt; &gt; - _Perspectives of New Music_ 1996<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I haven&apos;t seen this one...</p><p>That&apos;s the one you need.

Big chunks of this<br/>score also appears in the following article:</p><p>Shinn, Randall.  1977.<br/>&quot;Ben Johnston&apos;s Fourth String Quartet&quot;.<br/>_Perspectives of New Music_, vol 15 no 2 [Spring-Summer], p 145-173).</p><p>Note that this piece is especially a good starting point for you<br/>because I give lattices of its scales in my book.</p><p>2)<br/>In my opinion, the most outstanding example of Johnston&apos;s ability<br/>and talent is his _6th Quartet_.  A great analysis of this was<br/>given in:</p><p>Elster, Steven.  1991.<br/>&quot;A Harmonic and Serial Analysis of Ben Johnston&apos;s<br/> String Quartet No. 6&quot;.<br/>_Perspectives of New Music_, vol 29 no 2 [Summer], p 138-165.</p><p>(Note that this is the same issue as the Fonville article.)</p><p>There was a recording of this on vinyl, unfortunately now long<br/>out of print.  Again, I believe I tracked down a copy of it<br/>at the Philadelphia Library.  It&apos;s a good performance (better,<br/>IMO, than the way Kronos handles Johnston&apos;s work).</p><p>There, that should keep you busy studying for quite some time...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21253 href="#21253">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/18/2001 1:46:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SO, what&apos;s the 25:24 all about??<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Joseph.</p><p>You may recall, from our off-list conversations a couple of weeks<br/>ago, me explaining to you how the 25:24 is the JI chromatic semitone,<br/>hence Ben Johnston&apos;s chromatic symbols (#, b) indicate raising or<br/>lowering by a 25:24.

And if others find<br/>it useful, good for them.</p><p>I just think it&apos;s unfortunate that it seems to be slowly becoming<br/>the default JI staff-based notation, when there is a clearly<br/>superior alternative.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said, Wolf&apos;s notation is essential identical to mine,<br/>at least conceptually.  I know now that you like it, Joe, but<br/>I really don&apos;t see the need for the strange typographical symbols,<br/>even tho I admit that they have a nice compactness which<br/>facilitates reading the notation.</p><p>I know for sure that I&apos;ll never give up my plain ol&apos; number-based<br/>prime-factor notation.

They both have a clear grasp (and have provided the two<br/>clearest explanations) of what JI is all about. JI is about sound (at<br/>least to many of us -- i know Dante Rosati has a different<br/>philosophy, so we should remain respectful of that). Perhaps some<br/>serial composition is more about notes on a page than about sound.<br/>But to these two men, JI is about sound. These men would simply write<br/>in ratios if that were a useful notation. It wouldn&apos;t affect the<br/>music they wrote.</p><p>By the way, did you catch David Doty&apos;s reply to you on this list?</p><p>But you still haven&apos;t said much about how you expect yout notation to<br/>be used.

Those are the questions i would be<br/>asking, rather than worrying about anyone&apos;s &quot;stature&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, here are some just major and minor triads in Johnston&apos;s<br/>notation:</p><p>Bb- D-  F   (major)</p><p>Bb  D   F+  (major)</p><p>B-  D-  F#  (minor)</p><p>B   D   F#+ (minor)</p><p>C   E   G   (major)</p><p>C   Eb  G   (minor)</p><p>D-  F#  A   (major)</p><p>D   F#+ A+  (major)</p><p>D-  F   A   (minor)</p><p>D   F+  A+  (minor)</p><p>Now the same triads in Wolf&apos;s notation:</p><p>Bb  D-  F   (major)</p><p>Bb+ D   F+  (major)</p><p>B-  D   F#- (minor)</p><p>B   D+  F#  (minor)</p><p>C   E-  G   (major)</p><p>C   Eb+ G   (minor)</p><p>D   F#- A   (major)</p><p>D+  F#  A+  (major)</p><p>D-  F   A-  (minor)</p><p>D   F+  A   (minor)</p><p>Note that in Wolf&apos;s notation, the root and fifth always have the same<br/>commatic accidental applied to them; the minor third has an extra +<br/>(or one less -), and the major third has an extra - (or one less +).<br/>These conventions are easy to remember since the alterations are<br/>measured from the Pythagorean basis of Wolf&apos;s notation.</p><p>In Johnston&apos;s notation, there is no consistent pattern to the way the<br/>triads are notated. You have to look at a lattice diagram to know<br/>where you are. Even if you take for granted that all triads in a<br/>score are going to sound just, reckoning the melodic intervals from<br/>one to the other is still going to require you to stop and look at<br/>the lattice (until you have the process memorized).</p><p>Of course, Joseph, you should make sure you understand both notations<br/>fully and have thought sufficiently about their implications before<br/>you make a decision.

The thought of this has<br/>&gt; &gt; me mesmerized at the moment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; HOWEVER, I am not fully convinced that a performer could do this.<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe if the tempo were VERY slow, but how about in fast passages?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Does anybody know the success of Ben Johnston in making this<br/>&gt; &gt; happen with real, live instrumentalists??  Perhaps I need to<br/>&gt; &gt; know more about Johnston.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I tried to emphasize in my previous post, Joe, Johnston has<br/>&gt; fairly good success with his method *because* the music he<br/>&gt; writes is permeated with vertical JI sonorities (o- and<br/>&gt; u-tonalities).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Therefore, once the performers understand both the notation<br/>&gt; and the compositional style, it&apos;s pretty easy to get decent<br/>&gt; results.  Of course, results vary widely depending on the<br/>&gt; performer...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I met Johnston in New York in (IIRC) December 1996, when Eric<br/>&gt; Grunen and a small orchestra performed his _Chamber Symphony_.<br/>&gt; I attended the rehearsal, and, while I was unfamiliar with the<br/>&gt; score previously, as I looked at it, it seemed to me that<br/>&gt; most of the performers were navigating the intonational field<br/>&gt; quite admirably.</p><p>That&apos;s when I met him too...  Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t know YOU at<br/>that time!  I remember that it was quite a nice piece, but I would<br/>have no idea if the intonation was correct.  Too bad about Eric<br/>Grunen.  That&apos;s a real good example of somebody with a lot of<br/>ambition who spent above his means...</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am STILL unconvinced that performers<br/>&gt; &gt; could really use this system even if a composer could figure<br/>&gt; &gt; it out.  For me, I would need some kind of charts or more<br/>&gt; &gt; systematic instruction in order to work practically with it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s not like I&apos;m &quot;well, isn&apos;t this theory interesting... now on<br/>to the next thing...&quot;  I would really want to understand it in order<br/>to COMPOSE with it, not just regard it as a curiosity...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The fact that Kyle Gann and David Doty BOTH use it extensively<br/>&gt; &gt; augurs well for it as a system.  HOWEVER, I am under the<br/>&gt; &gt; impression that BOTH of them use it MOSTLY with ELECTRONIC<br/>&gt; &gt; works!  I could be wrong, but that is the impression I have.<br/>&gt; &gt; I have NO idea how much practical experience they have had<br/>&gt; &gt; with &quot;real&quot; performers with it...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please keep in mind the caveat I wrote above.  Johnston&apos;s notation<br/>&gt; works very well for both Gann and Doty *because* they compose<br/>&gt; in JI, and that 5-limit basic scale really *is* a basic part of<br/>&gt; their musical vocabulary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Based on what I know of your own compositions, Joe, it seems to<br/>&gt; me that the Wolf/Monzo Pythagorean-based notation would work<br/>&gt; better for you.  I&apos;ve never known any of your music to prominently<br/>&gt; feature 5-limit JI.  Based on the logical superiority of the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean-based approach, I think you would favor it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It looks like I might... perhaps it would be best to go for<br/>&quot;Monzotone&quot; rather than Wolf... since I am in more frequent<br/>communication with you...</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a quick tutorial:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnston&apos;s notation assumes that 7-tone 5-limit scale as its<br/>&gt; basis, which means that the 7 letter names with no other<br/>&gt; accidentals represent that scale: A B C D E F G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The sharps and flats in Johnston&apos;s system represent an alteration<br/>&gt; of any of those 7 notes by a 25:24.  Thus, if C = 1/1, then<br/>&gt; C# = 25/24.  If E = 5/4, then Eb = 6/5.  Etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The big problem I have is that, after 5, all of Johnston&apos;s<br/>&gt; accidentals logically and consistently represent a *prime-factor*<br/>&gt; intonational inflection, but he muddled this distinction when<br/>&gt; dealing with prime-factors 3 and 5.  So the plusses and minuses<br/>&gt; (+/-) represent the 81:80 syntonic comma, but in a &quot;weird&quot;<br/>&gt; pattern than can really only be understood by invoking lattice<br/>&gt; visualizations.</p><p>whoaboy...  This is where I want to get off the train...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be better to have the plain letters A B C D E F G<br/>&gt; to represent *only* prime-factor 3, as it already does<br/>&gt; historically in our standard notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, the sharps and flats would represent an inflection of<br/>&gt; 2187:2048 (== 3^7), the usual Pythagorean &quot;chromatic semitone&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;apotome&quot;, again, as it already does historically in our<br/>&gt; standard notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The two advantages to this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1)<br/>&gt; Elimination of the presence of prime-factor 5 in the sharps<br/>&gt; and flats, so that they only indicate intonational adjustments<br/>&gt; involving prime-factor 3, and so they too are on the same footing<br/>&gt; as all other accidentals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2)<br/>&gt; The presence of a plus or minus *always* indicates the presence<br/>&gt; of prime-factor 5.  This puts the +/- accidentals on the same<br/>&gt; footing as all the others (for 7, 11, 13, etc.).<br/>&gt;</p><p>The Pythagorean basis seems entirely logical and even historically<br/>based...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Johnston&apos;s notation, both the #/b *and* +/- accidentals<br/>&gt; *always* indicate an adjustment which includes *both*<br/>&gt; prime-factors 3 and 5, because his basic scale includes both.<br/>&gt; This is my primary difficulty with his system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You&apos;re saying, then, that it&apos;s not entirely clear what&apos;s implied when<br/>using either the #/b or +/- ??</p><p>I&apos;m still not entirely getting this... but since you say it&apos;s<br/>confusing, maybe it&apos;s SUPPOSED to be confusing... so I&apos;m on the right<br/>track...</p><p>&gt; Johnston&apos;s approach is fairly easy to conceptualize IF THE<br/>&gt; RESOURCES REMAIN FAIRLY SMALL, which is not the case even<br/>&gt; in his own music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, that&apos;s bad, isn&apos;t it.  After all, Johnston is a person who, if<br/>I understand correctly, took the complexities of Western music,<br/>serialism, et al and applied microtonality to it...  So one would<br/>expect his music to be rather complex, no??</p><p>&gt; The Pythagorean-based approach is even simpler to conceptualize,<br/>&gt; but *MUCH* simpler to extend, because of its linearity, and<br/>&gt; because of the rigid consistency of its &quot;rules&quot; in regard to<br/>&gt; the meaning of accidentals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The notation is adapted to the kind of music written by the<br/>&gt; composer who invented it.  Same as with Partch.  It works<br/>&gt; for Johnston, and for several other JI composers, but that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t automatically mean that it would be well-suited for<br/>&gt; you or anyone else.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, perhaps I shouldn&apos;t admit this, but I&apos;m actually going the<br/>other way around (for better or worse!).  I&apos;m interested in exploring<br/>different tuning systems and ways of notation and feel that my music<br/>and personal style can adapt to them...</p><p>Of course, there are some people who will feel I am just using the<br/>&quot;flavor of the month.&quot;...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fonville, John. 1991.<br/>&gt; &quot;Ben Johnston&apos;s Extended Just Intonation: A Guide for<br/>Interpreters.&quot;<br/>&gt; _Perspectives of New Music_, vol 29, no 2 [Summer], p 106-137.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I just went here to their website:</p><p><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/pnm/">http://depts.washington.edu/pnm/</a></p><p>and have asked about ordering this back issue...</p><p>&gt; Of course, the best way to understand all this is to vault over<br/>&gt; the theoretical articles and study the scores themselves.</p><p>Yes, but these scores are not going to make any sense if I don&apos;t have<br/>a &quot;key&quot; to the notation, correct??</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two recommendations:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1)<br/>&gt; The most easily available Johnston recording is his _4th Quartet_<br/>&gt; (variations on &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; - it goes up to 7-limit) on the<br/>&gt; Kronos Quartet CD _White Man Sleeps_.

Perhaps some<br/>&gt; serial composition is more about notes on a page than about sound.<br/>&gt; But to these two men, JI is about sound.

The only extra symbols needed are the plus and<br/>minus, which indicate the syntonic comma.<br/>The syntonic comma is the difference between the whole step in-<br/>between DO and RE and the whole step in-between RE and MI. The first<br/>is a Pythagorean second, a 9:8 relation. The other is a 10:9<br/>relation, which is the gap between a just major third and the<br/>Pythagorean whole-step; the difference is 81:80. That difference must<br/>be indicated, because the lack of care about it is what makes playing<br/>in just intonation so difficult.&quot;</p><p>Now this is really ironic -- granting Johnston&apos;s rationalization of<br/>DO, RE, and MI, Johnston&apos;s actual notation notates these notes C, D,<br/>and E, with no further accidentals. He says &quot;that difference must be<br/>indicated&quot;, but in his own notation, that difference is concealed!</p><p>Next:</p><p>&quot;Hindemith talks about this problem in The Craft of Musical<br/>Composition, but as a violist, not as a composer. He speaks about the<br/>necessity to conceal the comma in playing. String players will<br/>naturally try to play Mozart, or any other triadic music, with just<br/>triads. But in doing so, they run into the problem of the comma. Now,<br/>they won&apos;t make the mistake of playing LA-flat rather than SOL-sharp;<br/>that&apos;s an egregious mistake; it&apos;s 40 cents off, nobody would do that.<br/>But twenty cents off, maybe. The comma is only about 22 cents.<br/>Indeed, if they were to play the progression I-VI-II-V-I over and<br/>over again, they would move by common tone, dropping a comma every<br/>time. After five repetitions, they would be a half-tone flat!<br/>So the pluses and minuses are necessary; I just added those to the<br/>ordinary notation.&quot;</p><p>Here it&apos;s uncertain what Johnston means -- are the pluses and minuses<br/>necessary to prevent the drift, or to accurately notate it? In the<br/>latter case, well some of Johnston&apos;s compositions purposely use<br/>drift . . . but in Mozart, I don&apos;t think we&apos;d want it (this is tonal<br/>music, after all, which over the course of a piece modulates from the<br/>tonic and then returns to it) because, in my opinion, good string<br/>players playing just triads would hide the comma not by putting it<br/>all in one place melodically, but by dividing it into smaller melodic<br/>chunks that pass by unnoticed.</p><p>&quot;Then when I wanted to go an extra step, I asked myself &shy; what<br/>interval is the seventh partial closest to? It&apos;s closest to a minor<br/>seventh, lowered by 49 cents.&quot;</p><p>Now of course Johnston means the 9:5 minor seventh and not the 16:9<br/>minor seventh. But why? Even the 5-limit JI diatonic scale that forms<br/>the basis of his notation has three of the latter and only two of the<br/>former.</p><p>&quot;Do these terms get in your way, major third, perfect fifth...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not really.

In the Wolf notation you<br/>&gt; can actually SEE that the major thirds are smaller than the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean and the minor thirds are larger!  It&apos;s consistent<br/>&gt; with that throughout!</p><p>Exactly!  This is the point I&apos;ve been hammering home.</p><p>Joe, since you like Paul&apos;s example of the &quot;comma pump&quot; here so<br/>much, I&apos;ll refer back to the post you wrote right before this<br/>one, in which Paul explained that the step-size of 72-tET is<br/>also the size of the comma in that system, and tie it into this.</p><p>I think at this point it would probably be a good idea to<br/>illustrate the pitches in Paul&apos;s example on a lattice.<br/>This is in Wolf&apos;s version of HEWM notation:</p><p>    E--...B--<br/>   / \   / \<br/>  /   \ /   \<br/> C-....G-....D-....A-....E-<br/>              \   / \   / \<br/>               \ /   \ /   \<br/>                F.....C.....G</p><p>Note that you were able to easily follow Paul&apos;s line of argument<br/>and understand exactly what he illustrated in HEWM notation<br/>*without* having to refer to a lattice!</p><p>Unless you&apos;ve got an incredibly good memory for spatial<br/>relationships, this would be much more difficult in Johnston&apos;s<br/>system.</p><p>Since it&apos;s now easy for you to see how the +/- accidentals<br/>in HEWM notation designate commatic differences, all I have<br/>to point out is that in 72-tET it works pretty much the same<br/>way.  The minus sign which indicates that a 12-tET pitch is<br/>to be flattened by 1/12-tone would give a set of pitches notated<br/>just like the middle row in this lattice, and in the most<br/>common context, these notes would also have the same harmonic<br/>or scalar function as the JI notes in HEWM notation.  This<br/>is what Paul meant when he said that +/- also designates the<br/>comma in 72-tET.</p><p>The difference lies in the increasing exponents: that is,<br/>when we get to the ratios in the top row of this lattice,<br/>which have 5^2 as a factor, 72-tET doesn&apos;t have to use &quot;--&quot;<br/>because it already has &quot;&lt;&quot; (or an equivalent, depending on<br/>whose version you&apos;re using) to represent a flattening by<br/>1/6-tone.  So in 72-tET (or 72-EDO, as I prefer to call it),<br/>the lattice looks nearly identical, like this:</p><p>    E&lt;....B&lt;<br/>   / \   / \<br/>  /   \ /   \<br/> C-....G-....D-....A-....E-<br/>              \   / \   / \<br/>               \ /   \ /   \<br/>                F.....C.....G</p><p>Here&apos;s another interesting point to note.  72-tET uses<br/>&quot;&lt;&quot; to represent the basic septimal deviation from 12-tET<br/>(~31 cents in JI, 33-&amp;-1/3 cents in 72-tET *tuning*), so<br/>that the 7th harmonic of &quot;C&quot; (i.e., the 7:4 ratio above 1/1)<br/>would be notated &quot;Bb&lt;&quot;.  Well, check this out...</p><p>Let&apos;s make a lattice illustrating the 5-limit JI &quot;augmented 6th&quot;,<br/>225:128 (= ~977 cents), which as Fokker demonstrated is only a<br/>225:224 (~8 cents) wider than 7:4 :</p><p>In HEWM JI notation:</p><p>      G#--..D#--..A#--<br/>      / \   / \   /<br/>     /   \ /   \ /<br/>    E-....B-....F#-<br/>   / \   / \   / \<br/>  /   \ /   \ /   \<br/> C.....G.....D.....A</p><p>In 72-tET notation:</p><p>      G#&lt;...D#&lt;...A#&lt;<br/>      / \   / \   /<br/>     /   \ /   \ /<br/>    E-....B-....F#-<br/>   / \   / \   / \<br/>  /   \ /   \ /   \<br/> C.....G.....D.....A</p><p>72-tET notation uses the same letter-names and #/b accidentals<br/>as 12-tET, with all the same enharmonic equivalences.  So<br/>guess what?  In 72-tET, A#&lt; and Bb&lt; are enharmonically equivalent,<br/>that is, they are presumed to be the *same pitch*.</p><p>(I say &quot;presumed&quot; because in actual practice the composer may<br/>intend for the players to use 72-tET as a rough guide and adjust<br/>their intonation slightly to produce actual JI pitches.)</p><p>So a notational complication is done away with, because the<br/>225:224 &quot;vanishes&quot;.</p><p>Of course, this is not the case in HEWM notation, because<br/>HEWM gives every prime-factor a distinct accidental.  So if<br/>the particular version of HEWM is using &lt; and &gt; to represent<br/>an intonational inflection of 7^1 and 7^-1, respectively,<br/>then the &quot;harmonic 7th&quot; is notated as Bb&lt;, while (as can be<br/>seen in the first of the two lattices above) the 5-limit<br/>&quot;augmented 6th&quot; is notated as A#--.</p><p>Each of the two notations thus handles situations like this<br/>in their own way.  The way I see it, there are advantages and<br/>disadvantages to both, so it&apos;s nice to be familiar with both<br/>of them, to be able to use whichever one seems better for a<br/>given compositional context... or even to combine them.</p><p>In my version of HEWM, with the numbers as accidentals, one<br/>may combine both, as I explained in my other post, so that<br/>the &quot;harmonic 7th&quot; may be written 7^1 Bb&lt;, and the &quot;augmented<br/>6th&quot; as 5^2 A#&lt;.  So in this case, the 72-tET Bb&lt; or A#&lt; gives<br/>the performer a quick indication of the general pitch of the<br/>note as &quot;Bb minus 1/6-tone&quot;, and the numerical accidental<br/>literally fine-tunes it as ~969 or ~977 cents respectively.</p><p>But of course, as with any JI composer, this fine-tuning is<br/>meant to be understood and achieved by ear more than by eye.<br/>The presence of a 5 in the accidental will tell the performer<br/>that it&apos;s supposed to be a sweet 5:4 &quot;major 3rd&quot; relation to<br/>another note in the chord, and the presence of 7 will tell<br/>him/her that it&apos;s supposed to be a 7:4 relation to some note.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although I believe it STILL would be hard for a conventional<br/>&gt; performer to learn at least it MAKES SENSE... systematically...</p><p>On the contrary, the Boston-area microtonalists who have learned<br/>the 72-tET notation from Ezra Sims and Maneri/vanDuyne have<br/>demonstrated that it&apos;s easy to comfortably navigate the commatic<br/>distinctions represented by 72-tET.</p><p>You have a copy of the Maneri/vanDuyne book, don&apos;t you?<br/>Work your way thru just the first few sections, and you&apos;ll<br/>be surprised at how quickly and easily you can grasp 72-tET.</p><p>As I said in my other post, sometimes I use 1200-EDO as a<br/>supplement to HEWM instead of 72-EDO, as in my transcriptions<br/>of Partch&apos;s _The Intruder_ and Johnson&apos;s _Drunken Hearted Man_.<br/>So I mean no offense here to Johnny.</p><p>But in my experience, once you get used to 72-EDO, it seems<br/>to seductively claim your attention.  I know that these days<br/>when I get to writing down the microtonal music I hear in my<br/>mind, the first definite pinpointing of pitch usually happens<br/>in 72-EDO, and the other intonational refinements come later.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21504 href="#21504">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2001 11:45:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21486">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21486</a></p><p>&gt; [A great explanation of good points about 72-tET notation.]</p><p>Thanks, Paul - this is really terrific!</p><p>Joe [Pehrson],</p><p>The post I just wrote (with the lattice diagrams of the comma<br/>pump) says a lot of the same stuff Paul says here but in a<br/>different way, so I think the two posts together give a good<br/>overview of the value of 72-tET for notational purposes, and<br/>how it compares to HEWM.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21518 href="#21518">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/24/2001 9:29:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21486">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21486</a></p><p>&gt; This amazing fact stems from the fact that the unaltered pitches in<br/>&gt; 72-tET notation, 12-tET, play the role of the Pythagorean tuning in<br/>&gt; HEWM.

Beyond that, there are some ambiguous intervals, which only<br/>a triadic or larger chordal context can clear up (and, the errors get<br/>a little larger). Looking at the table at the bottom of Rick Tagawa&apos;s<br/>homepage, <a href="http://sites.netscape.net/masanoritagawa/homepage">http://sites.netscape.net/masanoritagawa/homepage</a>, you&apos;ll<br/>see a few of these ambiguities:</p><p>13:11 &quot;=&quot; 20:17<br/>13:10 &quot;=&quot; 22:17</p><p>etc.</p><p>Anyhow, to answer your specific question, 72-tET&apos;s approximation of<br/>the 17th harmonic actually is the 12-tET semitone. So the 17th<br/>harmonic of C is C#, etc. This is only 5 cents off -- the 17th<br/>harmonic is actually 105 cents (plus 4 octaves).</p><p>The 13th harmonic above C is approximated, in 72-tET, by A-1/3-tone-<br/>flat, 50 steps of 72-tET, or 833.3 cents. This is 7 cents flat of the<br/>true 13th harmonic.</p><p>So we can supplement our rules for factors of 5, 7, and 11 with rules<br/>for 13 and 17. Every factor of 13 in the numerator moves you to the<br/>12-tET system up 1/6-tone (or down 1/3-tone). Factors of 17 leave you<br/>in the same 12-tET system you started in.</p><p>Once you hit the 19-limit, 72-tET is inconsistent. For example, the<br/>best approximation of 8:19 is 90 steps of 72-tET; the best<br/>approximation of 13:19 is 39 steps of 72-tET; but if you use these<br/>approximations to construct an 8:13:19 triad, 8:13 would have to be<br/>approximated by 90 - 39 = 51 steps of 72-tET -- but we&apos;ve seen that<br/>50 steps is a better approximation. Of course, 72-tET is such a fine<br/>division of the octave that even such mis-approximations are still<br/>pretty good, such that Ezra Sims has actually used 72-tET to notate<br/>37-limit JI music. Whether this will work in general or not, of<br/>course, depends on the particulars of the composition in question and<br/>the musicians called upon to perform it.</p><p>Again, the stuff at the bottom of Rick&apos;s homepage should elaborate on<br/>this and make it clearer . . .</p></div><h3><a id=21543 href="#21543">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/24/2001 3:02:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK... so does that mean that the 225:224 in 72-tET is the &quot;unison<br/>&gt; vector??&quot;</p><p>It is a unison vector -- just like 81:80 is a unison vector in 12-<br/>tET, 19-tET, 31-tET, and all meantone temperaments . . .</p><p>&gt;Is that the &quot;Periodicity Block&quot; in action (??)</p><p>Well, many periodicity blocks that have 72 tones have 225:224 as one<br/>of the unison vectors . . . of course there are usually 2 or 3<br/>others . . .</p></div><h3><a id=21559 href="#21559">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/24/2001 9:14:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21533">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21533</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t!

It runs in a sort of work book<br/>style, but there are many short musical examples and a variety of<br/>practical pitch organization approaches. It doesn&apos;t really deal with<br/>just intonation. For that, try Ezra Sim&apos;s article in Computer Music<br/>Journal from about 1988 or so, which arranges the 72 notes into<br/>scales of 18 tones, and transposes around among them.&quot;</p><p>Well, this is nice... but finding a _Computer Music Journal_<br/>from &quot;about 1988 or so&quot; with NO TITLE OR AUTHOR, might not be such an<br/>easy task....

This, essentially, is the same approach taken<br/>by Carrillo, Haba and Wyschnegradsky in an earlier generation or by<br/>Ferneyhough &amp; Co. nowadays: the use of microtones to create a highly<br/>inflected musical surface. One of Partch&apos;s initial impulses, to<br/>accurately represent the inflections of a speaking voice was not<br/>unrelated to this view. The alternative approach, whose pioneers were<br/>Lourie, Novaro, Partch (slightly later), Fokker, and Wilson, is<br/>probably more central to the interests of the tuning list membership,<br/>is certainly a deeper view of musical materials, but one which does<br/>not automatically dismiss the other aesthetic.&quot;</p><p>An e-mail from James McCartney....Anybody know who HE is??

This<br/>interval is the same ol&apos; 225:224 &quot;kleisma&quot; about which I<br/>wrote a few days ago in connection with the audible similarity<br/>of 225:128 and 7:4.  The kleisma is about 7.7 cents.</p><p>It was used by Fokker in his 1949 book _Just Intonation_ to<br/>teach singers how to sing 7-limit intervals in tune, by relating<br/>the 7-limit ratios to their kleismatic near-equivalent 5-limit<br/>cousins, with which the singers would already be familiar.<br/>Using &quot;C&quot; as 1/1, Fokker demonstrates how the 225:128 &quot;A#&quot;<br/>sounds very much like the 7:4 &quot;Bb&quot;.  (I posted a summary of<br/>this book in 1999.)</p><p>However, a while back I posted some interesting observations<br/>about this interval.</p><p>In retuning my _3 Plus 4_ (which is in D#-minor / F#-major)<br/>into JI, I found that at the climax of the section before the<br/>&quot;hook&quot;, the D#-minor chord only sounded &quot;right&quot; to me with<br/>a minor third of the very 75:64 [= ~274.582 cents] which Rick<br/>confounds with 7:6 [= ~266.87 cents].</p><p>But interestingly, I had tried 7:6 first and it didn&apos;t work.</p><p>I also tried 19:16 [= ~297.513 cents] for the &quot;minor 3rd&quot;,<br/>and liked it much better than 7:6 but not as much as 75:64.</p><p>The point?  19:16 is *much* farther away from 75:64 [~22.931<br/>cents, a kind of &quot;comma&quot;] than 7:6 is [the kleisma, ~7.7 cents],<br/>and yet the first two were the ones that had the similar &quot;affect&quot;<br/>to my ears.

You mentioned that the<br/>difference between the two is about 7 cents (yes, 1 degree of 171-<br/>tET). But no 7-cent errors actually afflict any tunable intervals<br/>here.

But in meantone the end result of<br/>this chain of intervals is much closer to 3:2. This allows you to<br/>have a V which is consonant with the I, forming a near-3:2 ratio. I<br/>think most people would be pleased, rather than upset, that the JI<br/>behavior was thwarted here -- and yet no consonant interval was off<br/>by more than 1/4 comma, or ~5 cents -- so no 21.5-cent deviation from<br/>JI is evident to the ear (unless, again, you _so_ well-trained in<br/>strict JI (or 72-tET) that the sound of the 40:27 is etched in your<br/>mind).</p></div><h3><a id=21713 href="#21713">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2001 6:37:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:</p><p>&gt; To summarize, my reaction was that I found it highly unlikely that<br/>&gt; your ear was really targeting a 75:64 _harmonic interval_ -- 75:64<br/>&gt; can be built from two 5:4s and one 3:2 but there was no such<br/>&gt; construction operating in your piece -- rather it seemed that you<br/>&gt; simply wanted a small minor third of a particular width.</p><p>Right you are, Paul.

In fact Monz seems to be admitting (perhaps for the first time) that he actually<br/>targeted an interval he heard by ear, and then altered that pitch slightly so that it could be<br/>expressed as a 5-prime-limit ratio, for no other reason than wanting the piece to be in<br/>5-prime-limit RI. The interval he heard by ear was clearly larger than 7:6 . . . and if he had to use<br/>72-tET, he might have used the 1/12-tone flat minor third to represent it . . . even though 7:6 and<br/>75:64 are both represented by a 1/6-tone flat minor third in 72-tET.</p><p>The real point of my message that should be of interest to you, in considering 72-tET, was<br/>well-illustrated in the meantone I-vi-ii-V analogy I was making there . . . if you&apos;re still interested,<br/>feel free to go back and read that analogy and tell me if it makes sense to you.</p></div><h3><a id=21783 href="#21783">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/28/2001 12:45:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21768">/tuning/topicId_20929.html#21768</a></p><p>&gt; The real point of my message that should be of interest to you, in<br/>considering 72-tET, was well-illustrated in the meantone I-vi-ii-V<br/>analogy I was making there . . . if you&apos;re still interested, feel<br/>free to go back and read that analogy and tell me if it makes sense<br/>to you.</p><p>Thanks, Paul...
