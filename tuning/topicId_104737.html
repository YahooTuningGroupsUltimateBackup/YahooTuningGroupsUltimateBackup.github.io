To that aim, I&apos;m trying to run down various threads regarding the interpretation of the source material. As you all know, one of the big challenges of interpreting German literature is determining exactly what the historical authors meant with the ubiquitous use of the verb &quot;schweben&quot; and it noun derivative &quot;Schwebung&quot;. Over the years, I&apos;ve seen lots lots of knowledgeable people arguing for two different definitions: (1) the words refer to the acoustic phenomenon now generally called &quot;beating&quot;;(2) the words refer to an aberration or offset in the size of an interval or the placement of a note in regards to some point of reference (usually a pure interval or the position required to produce such), i.e. the degree of tempering or detuning. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree to which each one of the two interpretations is favored among those who regularly busy themselves today with historical unequal temperaments.</p><p>I&apos;d be most grateful for any of you here who would like to participate. The survey can be accessed here:</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGN0UkxxemVaenVFMHcyeVI0eWFSS1E6MQ">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGN0UkxxemVaenVFMHcyeVI0eWFSS1E6MQ</a></p><p>I&apos;ll post the results to the list after I&apos;ve got a good number of responses.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>Paul</p></div>
