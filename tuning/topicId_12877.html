I happen to know some of them rather intimately...  It<br/>doesn&apos;t take much intelligence to get an advanced degree... but one<br/>does have to know how to sit still in a chair for a very long period<br/>of time.  The Germans, as you may know, call this ability<br/>&quot;Sitzenfleisch...&quot;</p><p>Heinrich Schenker lived from 1969-1935.  There is quite a nice<br/>section about him in Willi Apel&apos;s Harvard Dictionary (tres abstruse<br/>source...) I will quote a little of it for people not wishing to take<br/>their eyes from the screen:</p><p>&quot;...Schenker&apos;s point of departure is &quot;nature,&quot; i.e. the overtone<br/>series through the fifth partial, from which man derives not only the<br/>major triad but all the intervals, scales, and basic structures of<br/>music.  The overtones (1,2,3,5; i.e., unison, octave, fifth, major<br/>third) constitute the KLANG (sound, sonority) or natural triad, which<br/>may appear in its vertical or horizontal position.  The horizontal<br/>projection of the KLANG determines the melody as well as the bass.<br/>In the latter it appears as GRUNDBRECHUNG or BASSBRECHUNG (broken<br/>ground), mainly as a succession of I and V; in the former as URLINIE<br/>(primordial, fundamental line), in which the basic tones, I, III, V,<br/>are filled in with others.  URLINIE and GRUNDBRECHUNG together<br/>constitute the URSATZ (fundamental setting), which is the basic<br/>structure, the &quot;background&quot; of the composition...</p><p>ACHTUNG!  Actually, the experiences I have had with Schenker in music<br/>school were all rather positive.  It&apos;s a little like &quot;diagramming<br/>sentences.&quot;  There is a graphic system employed that makes it quite<br/>fascinating.  There are &quot;great big&quot; notes... corresponding to the<br/>major points of arrival... yes, generally I, IV or V, and the<br/>diagrammed notes get progressively smaller in size as you map out<br/>linear surface events.</p><p>I always found that the real strength in Schenker was the &quot;pitch<br/>height&quot; realizations.  One could really see how melodies were<br/>constructed with &quot;expectations&quot; built in for development, depending<br/>on what &quot;pitch height&quot; one had arrived at, and how it corresponded to<br/>the underlying harmony.</p><p>So as a &quot;reductional analysis&quot; I always found Schenker superb... but<br/>then, it was not &quot;straight without water&quot; out of Schenker&apos;s 1906<br/>harmony book... People have changed the system over the years to suit<br/>analytical ends... In fact, the HARMONY work doesn&apos;t even show any<br/>different &quot;sized&quot; noteheads...  I&apos;m not even certain that he<br/>developed this feature HIMSELF... It could well be a later addition<br/>(??)</p><p>BUT, of course, Schenker had no comparable background in the physical<br/>sciences as someone like Helmholtz... whose SENSATIONS was about 20<br/>years earlier...</p><p>Schenker was more your &quot;typical&quot; musiklehrer, as you correctly<br/>guessed.  However, given the fact that most people were only<br/>realizing figured basses and doing harmonic exercises with NO thought<br/>of melodic development or &quot;pitch height,&quot; his work... and especially<br/>the more &quot;modern&quot; manifestations of it, sprang &quot;light years&quot;<br/>forward...</p><p>________ ____ _ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=12884 href="#12884">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 4:49:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe, thanks for the fleshing out!

However, here, the<br/>author may not be committing a crime by assuming a connection between<br/>scale degrees and acoustic intervals, since in the case of the meantone<br/>diatonic scale it exists.  Though incomplete without a discussion of<br/>tuning, theory in terms of scale degrees may be the most useful kind for<br/>the practitioner of common-practice-style music -- if I had to have one<br/>without the other, I&apos;d probably take the scale-based theory.</p><p>But if this kind of thing gets your goat, as it did mine after 13 years<br/>of music education (including a year of composition, theory, and piano<br/>at the Conservatory of Music at Indiana University) without one mention of<br/>tuning, you&apos;d probably like Doty&apos;s JI Primer as much as I did.  It totally<br/>busts these Schenker types (with appologies to Schenker for the term).</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s Forte on parallel fifths (p. 54):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Parallel 5ths are avoided because the 5th formed by scale degree<br/>&gt;   1 and 5 is the primary harmonic interval, the interval which divides<br/>&gt;   the scale and thus defines the key.

That seems bizarre: the distraction,<br/>&gt;     if any, caused by parallel fifths seems to my ear no greater than<br/>&gt;     things that DO happen and are encouraged by these rules.</p><p>Though the existence of parallel fifths alone is hardly enough, sections<br/>of tonal music harmonized in parallel fifths can easily run into problems,<br/>since this kind of music often relies on a steady pace of tonal motion,<br/>and as Rothenberg points out, the diatonic scale is highly efficient, so<br/>it takes some work to achieve this.  Take an hour, and set a hymn to 4-part<br/>harmony in three different ways, and you&apos;ll see for yourself immediately.<br/>Paul Erlich presents a reasonable version of all of this in his paper, with<br/>characteristic disonances, and so on.  Rothenberg&apos;s sufficient sets are<br/>another approach.</p><p>&gt;   . The art could not have developed?  It would not have developed in<br/>&gt;     exactly the same way, to be sure, but failing to prohibit something<br/>&gt;     does not mean that it must appear in every composition!</p><p>Of course.  I would also like to point out that, with mastery of the tonal<br/>style, harmonizing in parallel fifths is fine.  The rule that Forte so<br/>highly recommends is, in fact, a rule given to beginners, since learning<br/>to leave enough anchor points in a progression requires some subtlety.<br/>Beethovan didn&apos;t have a problem with it, though.  Or, you can skip the<br/>anchor points, and return to a more modal style, as in Jazz (harmonizing<br/>in parallel fifths is almost standard in some voicings).</p><p>If these rules of music theory really did dictate the behavior of composers,<br/>rather than describing it as Paul and I suggest, then perhaps they could<br/>also take credit for setting up a hegemony for great music to break!  (This<br/>may sound funny, but if you read your liner notes, you&apos;ll find nothing<br/>but praise for rule-breaking from Forte&apos;s colleagues.  With appologies to<br/>Forte for the term.)</p><p>&gt;Anyway, the parallel fifths thing is O.T., I suppose, and the idea of<br/>&gt;getting the book WAS to learn the sometimes strange rules under which<br/>&gt;some music (music I often like, to be sure!) was written, whether or not<br/>&gt;I agree with those rules.

In Pythagorean tuning, &apos;A&apos; was obviously<br/>the first reference pitch; now it&apos;s &apos;middle-C&apos; - there&apos;s a<br/>harmonic reason for that which I explore in my book and at:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm</a></p><p>The notes designated by &apos;sharps&apos; are a Pythagorean comma higher<br/>in pitch than the &apos;enharmonic equivalents&apos; designated by &apos;flats&apos;.<br/>e.g., if A = n^0 = 0 Semitones = 1/1, then Ab == 3^-7 = ~10.86<br/>Semitones, and G# == 3^5 = ~11.10 Semitones.  (I use &apos;==&apos; to<br/>mean &apos;8ve&apos;-equivalent; i.e., powers of 2 are ignored.)</p><p>Originally, &apos;accidentals&apos; really had a meaning close to what<br/>the word&apos;s etymology would suggest: used only as _musica ficta_,<br/>they indicated a mutation into a hexachord outside the &apos;regular&apos;<br/>tuning (_musica recta_).</p><p>This awkward system developed as a result of the diatonic basis<br/>of the slowly-evolving European gamut, and is also a residue of<br/>the ancient Greek theory of conjuct vs. disjunct tetrachords.</p><p>Theorists and composers realized that chromatic pitches were being<br/>used, and they were groping for a way to represent them within the<br/>established diatonic framework.  This was around 800 to 1300 AD in<br/>the Frankish Holy Roman Empire.</p><p>The meanings of accidentals as absolute pitch-values solidified<br/>around the 1400s, just when 5-limit harmonies were being accepted<br/>in theory (c.f. Ramos) and ancient Greek texts describing all<br/>sorts of rational tunings (c.f. Ptolemy) were being rediscovered<br/>by the Western Europeans after the Ottoman conquest of<br/>Constantinople.</p><p>- see my Dictionary entry for &apos;mutation&apos; for more background:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/mutation.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/mutation.htm</a></p><p>The twist is that in 5-limit JI theory and in the associated<br/>meantones that were its practical extensions, the situation<br/>is almost exactly the reverse of the Pythagorean.</p><p>I&apos;ll demonstrate:</p><p>By adding the Ab to this typical 5-limit 12-tone scale:</p><p>           5:3      5:4        15:8<br/>           F# ------ C# ------- G#<br/>           / \       / \      /  \<br/>          /   \     /   \    /    \<br/>         /     \   /     \  /      \<br/>      4:3 ----- 1:1 ---- 3:2 ----- 9:8<br/>       D         A        E         B<br/>      / \       / \      / \     /<br/>     /   \     /   \    /   \   /<br/>    /     \   /     \  /     \ /<br/> 16:15 --- 8:5 ---- 6:5 ---- 9:5<br/>   Bb       F        C        G<br/>              \     / \      /<br/>               \   /   \    /<br/>                \ /     \  /<br/>              48:25 --- 36:25<br/>                Ab       Eb</p><p>we again get two so-called &apos;enharmonically equivalent&apos; notes:<br/>Ab == 48/25 = ~11.29 Semitones, and G# == 15/8 = ~10.88 Semitones.<br/>This is almost precisely the reverse of the Pythagorean system<br/>described above.</p><p>In two important meantones, 1/4-comma (by far the most common)<br/>and 2/7-comma (advocated by Zarlino), we get the following pairs:</p><p>Ab == (3^-7)/((81/80)^(-7*(1/4))) = 11.24 Semitones<br/>G# == (3^ 5)/((81/80)^( 5*(1/4))) = 10.83 Semitones</p><p>Ab == (3^-7)/((81/80)^(-7*(2/7))) = 11.29 Semitones<br/>G# == (3^ 5)/((81/80)^( 5*(2/7))) = 10.79 Semitones</p><p>Enharmonic discrepancies for all meantones will be pretty close<br/>to the 5-limit JI equivalents, as these two demonstrate.</p><p>So here, just as the meaning of accidentals in notation solidified,<br/>they came to represent the opposite of their old Pythagorean<br/>transformations.  &apos;Sharps&apos; were now *lower* in pitch than the<br/>enharmonically equivalent &apos;flats&apos;.</p><p>Of course, over the years as meantone became firmly established,<br/>the textbooks ceased to mention the old Pythagorean version of<br/>the accidentals, and the 5-limit/meantone version became standard.<br/>The revival of appropriate Pythagorean tuning for pre-1500 music<br/>is very much a modern development.</p><p>Then, with the advent of near-universal acceptance of 12-tET<br/>in Euro-centric musicology, the harmony books struggled to<br/>describe the &apos;common-practice&apos; repertoire by retaining use<br/>of the 5-limit/meantone accidentals in the notation, while<br/>at the same time insisting in theory that the enharmonic<br/>differences could be ignored.</p><p>A truly confusing situation was the legacy, and it still<br/>plagues lots of trained musicians who either don&apos;t even<br/>realize their imprisonment within these contradictory<br/>limitations, or who do realize it and long to escape this<br/>confinement but don&apos;t know how.  The lucky few are those<br/>of us who have discovered the world of microtonality.</p><p>The exceptions in the 12-tET harmony books are the more<br/>modern ones, evolving ultimately from Schoenberg&apos;s theories,<br/>which present the 12-tET &apos;8ve&apos;-equivalent pitch-classes<br/>in a sensible method using the integers 0 to 11 to represent<br/>the 12 degrees.  If you&apos;re going to expound on 12-tET theory,<br/>you might as well use a notation that reflects the tuning<br/>you&apos;ve accepted!</p><p>In fact, I would argue that these modern 12-tET theories should<br/>more accurately be called 12-EDO, while the older, more confusing<br/>theories are very aptly called 12-tET.  The distinction is a<br/>very subtle one, but based on the fact that the older theory<br/>was very much meant to be a temperament used to describe harmonic<br/>practice grounded in 5-limit JI theory, wheras the newer theories<br/>are grounded firmly in the properties inherent in 12-EDO tuning<br/>itself.</p><p>There&apos;s been much interesting strictly-12-EDO theory presented in<br/>the pages of _Journal of Music Theory_ and _Perpectives of New<br/>Music_.  Some if it is even an attempt to ground theories of<br/>diatonicism in the 12-EDO scale, and much recent work makes use<br/>of the kinds of lattices we draw here, but twisted in various ways<br/>to reflect 12-EDO properties.</p><p>I have never read the Forte book under discussion, but I have<br/>his _The Structure of Atonal Music_; in this book, he too likes<br/>to make diagrams which represent tonal structures, again grounded<br/>in 12-EDO.  Many theorists today are taking concepts developed<br/>by Forte, Babbitt, and the rest of the &apos;academic crowd&apos; and<br/>applying them to microtonal pitch-sets, with interesting results.</p><p>In a weird sort of way, I see Erv Wilson&apos;s work as related to<br/>this too.  (This time I *do* hope that Kriag Grady isn&apos;t reading<br/>this... I think he&apos;d be pissed...)</p><p>I bet you never realized how much information was locked away<br/>between the covers of old music manuscripts and more recent<br/>books and scores!  It&apos;s a journey into the past (and future)<br/>that I&apos;ve found fascinating.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=13011 href="#13011">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2000 7:26:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12963">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12963</a></p><p>&gt; The *big* problem - and it&apos;s a huge one - is that none of the<br/>&gt; &apos;traditional&apos; books bother to explain that theirs is but *one*<br/>&gt; perspective based in *one* particular tuning; instead they<br/>&gt; present that perspective as *the* one-and-only framework without<br/>&gt; any acknowledgment whatsoever of the vast universe of intonational<br/>&gt; possibilities that exist outside of 12-tET/meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s *really* interesting to me about the &apos;traditional&apos;<br/>&gt; harmony-books is that they *do* mix various different aspects of<br/>&gt; both 12-tET and meantone in their presentation, again without any<br/>&gt; acknowledgement whatsoever!<br/>&gt;</p><p>I want to thank you so much for this nice, concise explanation of our<br/>&quot;traditional&quot; accidentals!
