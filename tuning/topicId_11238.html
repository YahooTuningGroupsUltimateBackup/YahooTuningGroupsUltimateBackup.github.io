This is one of her wildest (really, it is... in<br/>it&apos;s way) and most intensive posts yet!  If I had any questions, they<br/>have certainly been answered now!  In fact, there were many questions<br/>answered I would never have thought to ask..  I&apos;m assuming some of the<br/>knowledgables on this list... Paul Erlich, Carl Lumma, many others, will<br/>debate the finer points, but it makes me want to try to write some<br/>pieces just using various tunings constructed from various Pythagoreans,<br/>or &quot;adjusted&quot; Pythagoreans...<br/>_________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
