(Not complaining about Helmholtz, of course, just<br/>&gt;observing)</p><p>Helmholtz was just making an analogy, and one that is still appropriate<br/>today according to a major school of thought in psychoacoustics (Parncutt,<br/>Sethares?), whereby the apparant &quot;fusion&quot; of the harmonic series is a<br/>learned (perhaps prenatally) phenomenon rather than an inborn one.</p><p>&gt;But how about in a &quot;natural&quot; sound.  How do people find the partials<br/>&gt;then??  Can computer programs easily do this now??</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;How does the EAR do<br/>&gt;it??</p><p>Look up &quot;cochlea&quot; in the encyclopedia.</p><p>&gt;And, finally, how did Fourier HIMSELF do it??... if he was back at the<br/>&gt;beginning of the 19th century.  Questions, questions.</p><p>Fourier did nothing more than prove the mathematical assertion that all<br/>well-behaved functions could be uniquely analyzsed into sine and cosine<br/>components. This was quite surprising at the time. He was actually<br/>interested in heat, not sound.</p><p>My recollection about Mersenne is that he was first to assert the existence<br/>of overtones. I doubt he actually went as far as to say that they determine<br/>timbre.</p></div>
