If you&apos;re still planning to do a fingerboard directly from<br/>&gt;the rational definition of the scale, then I have failed. I&apos;d really<br/>&gt;like to know where my proposal fell down, so I can do better next<br/>&gt;time. Is it the non-standard open string tuning, or the minimum fret<br/>&gt;spacing, or the errors too large (beating too fast)? Or some<br/>&gt;combination of these?</p><p>There was no problem with the scale. In a previous post I said that I actually<br/>enjoyed your scale most of all in my limited listening tests.

For this reason I obviously<br/>want have the same tuning [or as close as I can get] on my guitar. It was never<br/>my intention to take your tuning over mine. I consider the extra difficluty in<br/>construction to be minor point. I was more interested in taking that scale as a<br/>spring board to create something new in a tempered paradigm with all the<br/>attendant benefits of modulation straight frets.</p><p>&gt;How many frets or fretlets will you have with the rational fretting?</p><p>I haven&apos;t worked it out yet. There will be a few I guess. It doesn&apos;t bother me<br/>though.</p><p>&gt;There are some other options for microtemperament. One has only 1.9 c<br/>&gt;errors but will probably need a non-standard open tuning if it is to<br/>&gt;minimise the number of frets.</p><p>&gt;The other will use standard open tuning and only 0.4 c errors but it&apos;s<br/>&gt;not likely to reduce the number of frets much below that of the<br/>&gt;rational fretting (if at all).</p><p>These would all be good if I was not trying to match up to very accurate synths.<br/>Metasynth is very accurate and my ensonq has resolution of 0.37 cents which is<br/>pretty good too.</p><p>I am looking more at stuctural integrity [i.e MOS, tetrachords etc.] as guiding<br/>principles with the tempered guitar. I.e pattern making etc. with errors that<br/>are not too bad.</p><p>So Dave don&apos;t feel that you have failed.
