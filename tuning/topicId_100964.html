Unfortunately, so far I&apos;ve been able to figure it out only in those cases where either 3/1 or 5/1 can be described with 0 periods and any number of generators. If both 3/1 and 5/1 need a number of periods, then I still don&apos;t know how to solve the task. Anyway, this procedure is usable in many cases and I hope I&apos;m at least partialy on the right track.</p><p>For example, meantone and orwell allow both variants of generator mapping --  i.e. for describing 3/1 without any periods, meantone can use a 3/1-like generator itself and orwell splits it into 7 steps, while if you wish to describe 5/1 without any periods, then meantone splits it into 4 steps and orwell into 3 steps. The same can be applied to temperaments like hanson (3/1), magic (either 3/1 or 5/1), schismatic (3/1), superpyth (3/1), diaschismatic (3/1), wizard (5/1), wuerschmidt (5/1), mavila (3/1) and a few others.</p><p>For the general explanation of the procedure, let&apos;s assume the following symbols representing the period/generator mapping:<br/>(PA, GA)<br/>(PB, GB)<br/>(PC, GC)<br/>(PD, GD)<br/>And let&apos;s assume &lt;&lt;W1, W2, W3&gt;&gt; to represent the 5-limit wedgie. Then:</p><p>If the temperament allows to map 3/1 without using periods, the following is true:<br/>PA=GCD(W1,W2)<br/>GA=0<br/>PB=0<br/>GB=W1/PA<br/>PC=-W3/W1*PA<br/>GC=W2/PA</p><p>If the temperament allows to map 5/1 without using periods, the following is true:<br/>PA=GCD(W1,W2)<br/>GA=0<br/>PB=W3/W2*PA<br/>GB=W1/PA<br/>PC=0<br/>GC=W2/PA</p><p>What I&apos;m not sure about, however, is how I could find a similar &quot;all-integer&quot; mapping for temperaments like miracle where neither 3/1 nor 5/1 is expressed without involving periods.</p><p>But anyway, I think this could make wedgies even more understandable for people like me. I&apos;m speaking about it primarily because now I&apos;m thinking about wedgies regardless of which EDOs they come from. The fact that a wedgie fully characterizes a temperament is one thing and the fact that pairing up EDOs of &quot;such and such&quot; gives me a wedgie of &quot;such and such&quot;  is another.</p><p>Comments and suggestions are appreciated.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=100995 href="#100995">ðŸ”—</a>petrparizek2000 &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2011 11:32:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; If the temperament allows to map 3/1 without using periods, the following is<br/>&gt; true:<br/>&gt; PA=GCD(W1,W2)<br/>&gt; GA=0<br/>&gt; PB=0<br/>&gt; GB=W1/PA<br/>&gt; PC=-W3/W1*PA<br/>&gt; GC=W2/PA<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the temperament allows to map 5/1 without using periods, the following is<br/>&gt; true:<br/>&gt; PA=GCD(W1,W2)<br/>&gt; GA=0<br/>&gt; PB=W3/W2*PA<br/>&gt; GB=W1/PA<br/>&gt; PC=0<br/>&gt; GC=W2/PA</p><p>I should also add that this can be easily extended to 7-limit wedgies as well (if we add W4, W5, W6 to the previously mentioned variables), in which case the number of periods for the 7/1 is either &quot;-W5/W1*PA&quot; IF 3/1 USES NO PERIODS or &quot;-W6/W2*PA&quot; IF 5/1 USES NO PERIODS. This explains the meaning of the number 12 in the 7-limit meantone wedgie of &lt;&lt;1, 4, 10, 4, 13, 12&gt;&gt;. For me that was something that I didn&apos;t understand for a long time. Actually, if there are 4 generators to a 5/1, then there are -3 periods (and 10 generators) to a 7/1, which is what it says (i.e. -12/4 = -3).</p><p>Petr</p></div>
