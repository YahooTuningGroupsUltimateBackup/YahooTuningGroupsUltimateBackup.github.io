Anyway, I would be interested in views of other people than myself as to if you have any particular preferences regarding these highly mistuned temperaments.</p><p>For unfamiliar readers, I&apos;ll quickly say that mavila is the temperament which more or less swaps major and minor intervals and where the limma of 135/128 is tempered out -- i.e. it can make a 7-tone &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot; scale of 5 + 2 intervals to the octave but the &quot;notated&quot; chord C-E-G approximates 10:12:15 while the notated C-Eb-G approximates 4:5:6 and therefore the notated major second is actually smaller than the notated minor second. For this reason, I&apos;m going to use the term &quot;primary step&quot; for the notated major second and &quot;secondary step&quot; for the minor second in the following paragraphs.</p><p>One possibility with stretched octaves is, for example, to use a primary step of ~154.2753 cents and a secondary step of ~217.8571 cents. In this version, the 5/4 approximation is 2/13-limma narrower and the 6/5 approximation is 1/13-limma narrower, and the triad of 1:5:12 is untempered.</p><p>Another interesting example can be ~152.6996 cents and ~223.3720 cents. This time, both the 5/4 and 6/5 approximations are narrowed by 1/9-limma, and the triad of 2:5:12 is untempered. Although this may not be so obvious at the first glance, an important difference here is in the 3/1 approximation --  1/9-limma narrower compared to 2/13-limma. The downside is that fourths are 1/3-limma wider, which I&apos;m already finding a bit too wide for my ears, should I really consider it an approximation of 4/3.</p><p>Another nice compromise is ~152.0595 cents and ~222.7319 cents. In this example, both the 5/4 and 6/5 approximations are narrowed by 1/8-limma, and the triad of 1:5:24 is untempered. Understandably, among these particular examples, this one has the worst fifths. OTOH, the fourths are a bit smaller than in the second case (although still larger than in the first one). What&apos;s more, this version has the least mistuning in the 8/5 approximation, while the first one has the least mistuning in the 5/3 approximation.</p><p>Taking all of this into consideration, I&apos;m finally getting to a conclusion that a very good &quot;mean&quot; of these three temperaments is the &quot;simple&quot; 2/7-limma mavila with pure octaves, which I&apos;ve already used in one composition back in 2008. From another view, however, I&apos;m still finding its fifths farily narrow, which is actually the primary reason why I got interested into the wider-octave variants in the first place. Of course, if my main aim is to get melodies with lots of unusual intervals, I could happily use fourths as large as, let&apos;s say, 4/9-octave. But if I want, above all, to get acceptable major/minor triads, I just have to change my way of thinking -- which is what I&apos;ve probably just done.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said earlier, I sadly can&apos;t try out my example temperaments now but I hope I&apos;ll eventually find a way to have a listen.</p><p>I appreciate any comments or suggestions from your side about this topic.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2010 12:08:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; But if I want, above<br/>&gt; all, to get acceptable major/minor triads, I just have to change my way of<br/>&gt; thinking -- which is what I&apos;ve probably just done.</p><p>Maybe I should have said &quot;recognizable triads&quot;.

I did some charts a while back and found that temperaments often have more than one region of better consistency within broader areas of lower consistency. (See <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Rank%202%20Consistency/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Rank%202%20Consistency/</a> for a few of these charts, in particular mavila5.png)</p><p>For mavila, the most consistent tunings have fourths wider than 522 cents, which is very wide for a fourth, but within the same range as your suggested tunings. The large pink area at the top of the chart is a range where mavila is not consistent enough to be useful. Stretching the octaves does give you better consistency in some cases, as well as improving the fifths as you&apos;ve noted. Which one sounds better will depend to a large extent on the timbres used.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2010 5:57:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr,</p><p>Mavila is a linear temperament?
