I use 11 and<br/>13 limit with extreme trepidation.  The 11th or 13th chord in 12ET are<br/>just another two chords.  But the same in JT have really &quot;burned&quot; me in<br/>the past.  I&apos;d have to look at my drafts, but I believe it was the just<br/>major 11th chord that marred a harmonious climax I was going for.  My<br/>guess is that it wasn&apos;t prepared correctly.  But the way I corrected the<br/>offending passage was just to eliminate the offending 11th.  The voices<br/>were leading to a climax at which point I thought an 11th chord might be<br/>the chord to which everything was leading, but I was wrong.  It was an<br/>experiment that blew up in my hands.</p><p>I had more success using the 11th in an earlier piece where the 11th was<br/>introduced before the rest of the chord.  And I think this showed me how<br/>carefully one needs to approach this tone.  In this situation, the 11th<br/>appearing alone was no big deal, but when the rest of the chord comes<br/>in, the 11th makes it sound very different, even fresh.</p><p>My experience with microtonal composition is that a lot of the rules of<br/>voice leading developed via 12 ET just don&apos;t work in these more cramped<br/>conditions.  And I think Danielou points this out with his universal<br/>harmonic scale and its avoidance of 7.  One example that comes to mind<br/>is a kind of Landini cadence idea I once used, whereby the leading tone<br/>keeps going higher by microtones.  Logic might dictate it would become<br/>&quot;more&quot; of a leading tone the higher it got, but perhaps because of the<br/>other voices, my ear now hears it as  jarring.  In this case, the term<br/>&quot;leading tone&quot; seems suspect.</p><p>To amplify on Danielous avoidance of 7, my impression is that the 7<br/>seems to lead away from tonic too much and it destroys the the tonal<br/>center so important to East Indian music.  I noticed in my analysis of<br/>one Japanese shakuhachi piece, the same applies.</p><p>Elliott Carter, by the way, hears all microtonal music as<br/>&quot;out-of-tune.&quot;  And I think that is the fine line the serious composer<br/>needs to address.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking of the way just intervals are used in folk music and in<br/>popular music where the pure intervals help to amplify the music and<br/>bring music &quot;in tune.&quot;</p><p>In terms of the spiritual quality of music, I equate &quot;spiritual&quot; with<br/>the concern we all share about just intonation. The concept behind<br/>&quot;miracle&quot; in Smokey Robinson and the Miracles or the &quot;delicate<br/>harmonies&quot; used to describe pygmy music might be reduced to tonal<br/>ratios.</p><p>RT</p></div><h3>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>3/12/1999 10:50:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Elliott Carter, by the way, hears all microtonal music as<br/>&gt;&quot;out-of-tune.&quot;</p><p>Personally, I hear all of Elliott Carter&apos;s music as &quot;out of tune.&quot;</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Carter&apos;s string<br/>quartets sound like four people sawing away in their own worlds, also easily<br/>simulated improvisationally.  Ives went for a similar effect in parts of his<br/>string quartets but with much better results I&apos;d say, and within the context<br/>of other parts where the players are playing together. Schoenberg opened the<br/>door to the overly-abstracted side of 12tet which comes to anti-fruition in<br/>Babbit et al. I think that stuff is pretty much played out now and will in<br/>the future be of little interest except to musicologists looking for obscure<br/>and forgotten 20thc. music to write their dissertations about. I took a look<br/>at Carters &quot;Changes&quot; for solo guitar but got impatient with trying to play<br/>rhythms that are better realized by a machine and sounds that have no rhyme<br/>nor reason (to my ears). Actually I think its the combination of over<br/>abstraction of sound and rhythm at the same time that puts that music beyond<br/>the pale. One or the other works better, thats why Schoenberg&apos;s serial<br/>tonality set in late romantic rhetoric is more listenable. Conversely,<br/>Thelonius Monk&apos;s sometimes far out rhythmic abstraction is framed by tonal<br/>harmony and also works.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/1999 1:05:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;I remember an issue of Perspectives of New Music years ago that had on the<br/>CD a piano piece by Brian Fernyhough (sp?) and in the rag a 50 page paper<br/>by him on the structure of the piece.

I found it<br/>extremely amusing to read how F. initially chose a set of chordal materials<br/>on the basis of their subjective ugliness.  There was certainly a lot of<br/>&apos;system&apos; in how the materials were worked out, but this is audible only at<br/>a very local level. We are left then with only the materials governing the<br/>overall coherence of the piece and their unsystematic nature, in the end,<br/>leads to an impression that it is essentially an improvisation on paper.<br/>Toop -- folowing his messy fall-out with the Stockhausen -- struggles<br/>mighty hard to claim F. as the saviour of the serial cause, but even he<br/>lacks conviction.</p><p>Richard Barrett, to my ears one of the best of the complexity camp, came<br/>directly from a background in improvisation, and he sometimes succeeds in<br/>finding a good balance between spontaneity and the discipline of notation.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/1999 11:15:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Schoenberg opened the<br/>&gt; door to the overly-abstracted side of 12tet which comes to anti-fruition in<br/>&gt; Babbit et al.

Schoenberg. I mean I&apos;ve played stockhausen and even Elliot Carter!<br/>He knew about 53 even and wouldn&apos;t take the leap!<br/>-- Kraig Grady&lt;</p><p>     First, Thanks for clearing up the scale! It could well be that the<br/>influence on Debussy was more of a way of hearing. There is his use of<br/>Pentatonic scales as especially his use of Pentatonic chords. There are<br/>passages where he rocks between two chords mush like you have in passages<br/>of the Wayang. Would not these type of passages possibly be common in<br/>pieces with Dance?<br/>-- Kraig Grady</p><p>KG -</p><p>Isn&apos;t the difficulty with Schoenberg more in his expressionistic style than<br/>in his use of 12tet? If he had composed in 53, it&apos;s unlikely that his style<br/>would have changed. Indeed, 53 -- which is far from the most suitable<br/>temperament for the kinds of thick harmonies he favored in the tonal works<br/>-- might have made his tonal practice even more restless. Since symmetry<br/>and complementarity are such important organizing principles for<br/>Schoenberg, he might have been much more attracted to working with<br/>combination-product sets...</p><p>I&apos;ve heard (and played in) a lot of wayang, both Javanese and Sundanese,<br/>but I don&apos;t quite get what you&apos;re after. As I wrote before, I think you&apos;re<br/>not going to find a convincing example of a material influence of gamelan<br/>on Debussy. As for pentatonic materials, there are plenty of European<br/>sources to look at, and rocking between chords in the way you describe<br/>sounds more like Satie or Mussorgsky or French folk song, than anything<br/>Indonesian. If there is an influence from Java, I think that it is<br/>something more subtle to be found in his keyboard writing and in his<br/>instrumental textures, for example in _En Blanc et Noir_ or my favorite<br/>_Six Epigraphes Antiques_.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/1999 7:11:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; KG -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t the difficulty with Schoenberg more in his expressionistic style than<br/>&gt; in his use of 12tet?
