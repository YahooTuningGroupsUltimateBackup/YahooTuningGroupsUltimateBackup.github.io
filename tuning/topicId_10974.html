There has obviously been a big<br/>&gt; discussion between Joe Monzo and Paul Erlich, only the tip<br/>&gt; of the wave we&apos;ve been seeing, and there have been some<br/>&gt; educational messages to Beckah regarding tuning...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, some of it might be &quot;over my head&quot; some of it &quot;under.&quot;<br/>&gt; However, I&apos;m a great &quot;scroller&quot; and I would enjoy having all<br/>&gt; of this stuff posted. Is there some reason why people refrain<br/>&gt; from posting the stuff to the list?? I can understand CCing<br/>&gt; to the individuals concerned, but it&apos;s leaving others &quot;out<br/>&gt; of the loop.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or am I out of line, and this is a &quot;loopy&quot; suggestion???</p><p>Hi Joe.</p><p>Yes, I suppose maybe you&apos;re only seeing &apos;the tip of the wave&apos;<br/>in some of the private discussions Paul Erlich and I have,<br/>but honestly, I do try to post most of this stuff to the List<br/>or ask Paul to post his response to it, because we&apos;ve gotten<br/>into some *really* heavy give-and-take in our private emails<br/>in the past that a lot of Listers wanted to see.<br/>(you might want to look up our &apos;Hendrix Chord&apos; discussion,<br/>now stored at Drew Skyfyre&apos;s website.)</p><p>The recent stuff of ours that you&apos;re seeing stems not from<br/>a &apos;big discussion&apos; we&apos;ve had recently, but from a webpage<br/>I made near the end of last year that you may have missed:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/woolhouse/essay.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/woolhouse/essay.htm</a><br/>a summary of W. S. B. Woolhouse&apos;s very-hard-to-find<br/>little book on tuning.  I&apos;m sure that if you were to read<br/>the webpage you&apos;d understand more about that recent posting.</p><p>It so happens that Paul and Woolhouse both calculated exactly<br/>the same tuning as one &apos;optimal&apos; meantone: 7/26-comma meantone.<br/>I say &apos;one&apos; because the optimum deviation from JI changes<br/>depending on the criteria used in the calculation.  See the<br/>summary table Paul made which I&apos;ve included in my &apos;meantone&apos;<br/>definition:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm</a></p><p>IMO, my biggest strength in tuning theory is my historical<br/>knowledge; I stumble along with the math the best I can,<br/>and in fact have learned a lot of math &apos;by osmosis&apos; since<br/>getting interested in tuning.</p><p>But I&apos;m pretty sure Paul would agree with me and say that<br/>*his* greatest strength as a tuning theorist is his mathematical<br/>ability.  So I always ask him for help when my math reaches<br/>a dead-end or, as in the case of Woolhouse, when a mathematical<br/>illustration given by someone has some steps excluded that<br/>I need to have filled in so that I understand what&apos;s happening.</p><p>At the end of our post-Woolhouse exchange, I asked Paul to<br/>show me how to factor the meantone formula, and I added it<br/>to the end of that webpage.  Recently, I got interested in<br/>exploring this again, figured out the several formulae that<br/>Paul quoted in his post by following his original example,<br/>then asked him to derive the general formula for me, as I<br/>couldn&apos;t figure it out.</p><p>Paul has doubts about the usefulness of prime-factoring<br/>meantones, because the exponents are not integers and<br/>therefore the Fundamental Rule of Arithmetic does not apply.</p><p>But it&apos;s useful for me because it allows me to plug the<br/>(non-integer) exponents of 2, 3, and 5 into my lattice formula<br/>and illustrate meantones on my lattices, along with JI pitches<br/>for reference.  Since my lattice formula can already optionally<br/>include &apos;2&apos; as a factor, I am now able to lattice JI, meantones,<br/>and ETs all on the same graph, which I think is a good thing.  :)</p><p>My ultimate objective is to be able to plot *any* and all types<br/>of tunings on the same lattice, so that any tuning may be seen<br/>as a subset of the total infinite set of pitches in a way which<br/>makes clear the rational underpinnings of the harmonic<br/>relationships.  Paul and I both have our doubts about how<br/>successfully my particular lattice formula does this, but<br/>so far, for me, it works best.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
