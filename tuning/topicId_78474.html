It contains many<br/>&gt; wonderful information visualizations -- it&apos;s pretty much<br/>&gt; unparalleled in that regard -- made all the nicer by the super<br/>&gt; high-resolution process it&apos;s printed with.  The text is<br/>&gt; repetitive and pedantic, but the idea of empirically exploring<br/>&gt; simple programs for scientific models is a good one.  It goes<br/>&gt; back at least to Hilbert (OK, he was looking for proofs rather<br/>&gt; than models).  Turing promoted a simple regime for animal<br/>&gt; pigmentation, which Wolfram expounds in the book (without<br/>&gt; attribution in the main text unfortunately).  But Wolfram<br/>&gt; does seem to have taken it farther than anyone else to date.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This lecture is a good summary for those who don&apos;t have the<br/>&gt; luxury of reading long-winded books during a protracted period<br/>&gt; of unemployment:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/149/">http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/149/</a><br/>&gt; I saw him give this talk at Stanford, where the physics<br/>&gt; professors were happy to show their disdain for any inquiry<br/>&gt; taking place outside of their ivory tower.  The MIT crowd here<br/>&gt; seems slightly more accommodating.  That said, Wolfram does<br/>&gt; not help the situation with his grandiose self-promotion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>That&apos;s a very level-headed review. I&apos;ll have to read more of the book<br/>to form an opinion I could consider fair, back to you in about 5<br/>years on that one.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=78499 href="#78499">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2008 10:58:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that ANK&apos;o&apos;S, in reference to music, differentiates<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; between constraints and ways of generating structures.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cite?

All of this stuff was written with older gear.  Tx802 (3) , Tx816, Akai s900, Synclavier, Roland D50, Korg m something, Roland Juno, Yamaha Tg77, Casio sampler, Proteus I, II, III</p><p>The sampling was done with a Synclavier--I had the NED sound libs, and lots of other stuff.</p><p>The Synclavier was built up in stages--the polyphonic sampling came later, and was grey-market:  I knew some guy who worked at the company, and he claimed he was fishing boards out of the dumpster.  Eventually we assembled a working system.</p><p>Speaking of dumpsters, that was the fate of my Synclav.  The company folded, it became obsolete, and I couldn&apos;t give it away.</p><p>It wasn&apos;t a happy moment.  I remember, the ailing President of NEC watched me as I heaved the big blue box into the dumpster, and my keys fell into the trash as well.</p><p>other samplers:  Kurzweil k2000r, with Miraslav Vitous orchestra samples I keymapped for a microtonal scale.  All that work!</p><p>Then, I used Studio Vision on a Mac.  Same deal.  Company went out of business.</p><p>Right now I&apos;ve got nothing I can do anything with:  I&apos;ve got Logic Pro on a powerful Mac, but I don&apos;t know how to use it, and I basically don&apos;t like any of the sounds, nor do I like all the bells and whistles.</p><p>So, I&apos;m between systems.   In a few months, I may have some money to invest in new gear, so I&apos;m going to go back to those emails that I somewhat rudely didn&apos;t respond to:  I apologize, but I got obsessed with something else, and then I felt guilty.</p><p>Moral of the story!

But, this is how I spent a fair portion of my time.</p><p>Now, I&apos;ve been writing for piano--12-tone pieces.  Nothing that will endear me to anyone here or anywhere else, but they&apos;re what I want to do:  simple, no gimmicks, no rhythm tracks, no bells and whistles.</p><p>I think that there are maybe 10-20 good pieces in the whole lot, depending on how you define &quot;good&quot;.</p><p>Basically, the pieces I spent a long time on, and/or have some real compositional idea, and/or some real instruments or humans somehow involved, are the best, IMO.</p><p>The microtonal jamming is just to document that I had some ear-to-hands facility with the 11-limit 36-note just scale I used.
