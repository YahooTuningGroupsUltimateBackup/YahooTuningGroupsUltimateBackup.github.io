The result will contain more than 12 notes.<br/>I appreciate that this is a clumsy workaround, but it does work get you the desired result; a recording using more than 12 notes per octave.</p><p>On 27 Feb 2015, at 09:16, Subhraag Singh allmusicsingh@...

If you have a 31-note scale, for instance, you&apos;re forcing individual samples to be transposed out of their good range, which results in chipmunk effects and the like. You need to change the ranges of the samples: this requires some programming in Aria. Some of it is explained here (this is for extending the ranges of instruments but it&apos;s the same script): <a href="http://garritan.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5333">http://garritan.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5333</a> <a href="http://garritan.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5333">http://garritan.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5333</a><br/> Garritan does not have the 12-notes-per-octave limitation &agrave; la Logic.</p><p> J</p></div>
