It got to the point where i could hear one Tetrad or Hexany and i know everything that is related to it. Later i looked at purely as a scale where one can transpose material to different places with interesting unique shifting of intonational difference.<br/> As an artist one wants to get to that point where one moves the material according to some inner sense or ear.<br/>It sounds like you are working with a 13 limit diamond.<br/>Since this is more a harmonically based territory, personally i would like to know what form of constant structure might contain it as well ones it contains. those here who can explain here all the pitches therein as an EDO will give one a clue as where one might look.<br/>It really is a very big animal though and i find over time i prefer working with smaller sets, but if you are really game on this you might try smalled subsets of it.<br/>There is a great advantage though to having two diamonds a 3/2 apart as just a single one, or even three. with 13 limit it might be too much.<br/>If one gets bogged down this way you can try to just jump from point to point aimlessly. Allot is discovered by accident and often one finds what one likes in unexpected corners.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;calebmrgn&quot; &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To be clear, I&apos;m not asking for advice, only for people to share stories if they want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Over the years, I&apos;ve tried composing in a variety of styles and with different methods and different amounts of &apos;precomposition&apos;--which can be anything from constructing 12-tone tables to building a synthesized orchestra to sketching a plot or graph of textures in advance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13-limit JI has some new intervals, new possibilities I haven&apos;t tried before, and the geography of the scale I&apos;m working with is unfamiliar.

The<br/>Persian _radif_, or repertory of modal families and themes<br/>(dastgah-s and gushe-s), likewise is a set of patterns to be<br/>learned and reinforced, traditionally by oral instruction,<br/>over a period of many years, so that it is possible to<br/>improvise (or compose) and make creative variations while<br/>remaining within a style which has been completely internalized.</p><p>One thing I am finding with the Persian repertory is that<br/>to understand a given dastgah or modal family such as Segah,<br/>which Jacques and I have been discussing by comparison to<br/>a Mohajira mode, it is very helpful to get some sense of the<br/>different modal themes or gushe-s that make up Segah, not<br/>only the Daramad or opening piece that sets a theme for<br/>the dastgah as a whole. Indeed the gushe-s or themes that<br/>are performed to make up the suite of a given dastgah are<br/>often modes in their own right!</p><p>Once I looked seriously into the gushe-s of Segah, I quickly<br/>confirmed Jacques&apos; good advice that it is not wise to cut<br/>up Segah into isolated tetrachords, some of which might fit<br/>a &quot;Mohajira&quot; resemblance, rather than look at the the whole<br/>seyir (I suspect that there is an appropriate term for this<br/>in Farsi or one of the other languages spoken in Iran). Indeed,<br/>very importantly for improvisation or composition, I learned<br/>that a basic Segah Dastgah requires at least 10 notes -- and<br/>that knowing not only which notes these are, but where and<br/>when they occur in the main gushe-s, is one very good prelude<br/>to exploring Iranian Segah.</p><p>Right now I&apos;m getting ready to attempt some polyphony in<br/>Maqam Penchgah. While I can explore some of the sonorities<br/>and cadences available -- quite a beautiful set! -- knowing<br/>the basic seyir would also be a good step! I&apos;m looking at<br/>some pieces available on the Web, and suspect that Ozan<br/>could give some excellent advice on the usual course of<br/>melodic development.</p><p>And, of course, how one approaches polyphony may depend<br/>not only on the structure of a given maqam or dastgah,<br/>but one&apos;s &quot;standard techniques&quot; of counterpoint or<br/>harmony. Thus Ozan and I might both find Penchgah a<br/>fine maqam for polyphony, but follow quite different<br/>rules of counterpoint.</p><p>Part of the fun is that on the Tuning list, people are<br/>here both to lend advice and expertise, and to share<br/>compositions that provide fertile points of departure.<br/>The Ethno2 contest is a fine example.</p><p>Today I was listening to some of the compositions both<br/>from this recent concert and over the years from Shaahin<br/>Mohajeri, which speak volumes about the skill, knowledge,<br/>sensitivity, and courage needed to draw upon the musics<br/>of the world and attempt something new.</p><p>By the way, my tendency to prepare shouldn&apos;t discourage<br/>anyone from getting out there and exploring a mode or<br/>tuning and learning through experience and feedback.<br/>Sometimes I think that my mistake is to prepare, but<br/>not sufficiently put that preparation into practice.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=91394 href="#91394">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2010 1:28:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo~<br/> A nice saying and more so in that i can take in a number of different ways.<br/>One is thinking the depth one gets with having to go over and over something gives one an idea of where to look. Applying a similar  way of looking at a set of tones can produce remarkable different results. An example one can look at the MOS like subsets of a scale and find different results in different numbered scales even if the principle is the same.<br/> Second, is what my friend angel who taught music in Switzerland for 25 years thought.<br/> He believe people go more looking at actual scores than harmony theory.<br/> To go through a score and really get what the composers does is more important than generalizations.<br/> Or so he thought.</p><p>The rest of your post reminds me of what I heard about the composer Nono scolding someone for not recognizing that all great art is guided by spirit,. He would not teach the person any more till they studied Renaissance art. This is how so many scales are used around the world. How the notes are used is as important than just the noun of what notes are used.<br/> We all try our hands at scales but no of use have the means of matching often of what happens when such a spirit is passed through many hands.
