One of the things about commas that doesn&apos;t get mentioned as often as tempering is that you can also expand them (as in the case of 34-ET), or even in some cases make them go negative (as in the case of 64-ET, which has a major third of 21 steps, and a fifth of 37 steps: four fifths is 148 steps, minus two octaves is 20 steps, so the comma is -1 step).</p><p>Other tunings with a comma in the size range of 34-ET (73-ET, 97-ET) are more complex and have thirds that aren&apos;t as good. There are smaller ET&apos;s with larger commas, but their thirds aren&apos;t as good either (although 22-ET is reasonably good for its size). I don&apos;t think you can get much smaller than the size of 34-ET steps before it starts sounding like a comma shift instead of a tiny melodic step. (41-ET might be about the lower limit....)</p></div>
