Consistency means that no<br/>JI interval has more than one ET representation.  Uniqueness means that no<br/>ET interval has more than one JI representation.  You need both for 1:1<br/>correspondence between ET and JI.</p><p>&gt;So I guess some of the things I&apos;m wondering are these: Is consistency more<br/>&gt;of a theoretically useful concept, or is it a really musically detectable<br/>&gt;(or useful) phenomena...</p><p>Well, consistency is mostly an improved way to measure the accuracy of a<br/>temperament.  In the old days, people just measured the deviations from the<br/>intervals they liked, and wound up getting a much greater error when they<br/>tried to play chords.  Likewise, lack of uniqueness can cause effective<br/>errors (try modulating from a utonal tetrad to a 5:6:7:9 chord in 12tET!)<br/>not apparent from plain deviation.</p><p>In the above examples, you have to ask yourself what property of the just<br/>scales you want to keep.  If you aren&apos;t playing them as chords, consistency<br/>doesn&apos;t make much difference.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=5747 href="#5747">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/1999 2:21:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Carl Lumma:]<br/>&gt; Should that be surprising?</p><p>Well, unless I&apos;m missing something (which is certainly possible...), I<br/>do think it is surprising (or at least that it&apos;s probably not going to<br/>be too readily apparent) that in 22e, which is consistent through the<br/>11-limit, a 1/1, 81/64, 3/2 Pythagorean triad is inconsistent, or that<br/>when one says that 26e is consistent through the 13-limit, that a 1/1,<br/>5/4, 3/2, 16/9 V chord is going to be inconsistent...
