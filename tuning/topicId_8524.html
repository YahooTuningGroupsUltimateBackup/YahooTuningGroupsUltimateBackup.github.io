Going from a primary to a secondary is cool, but not the<br/>&gt;reverse. Any subdominant chord can be &quot;preparation&quot; for dominant but is<br/>not<br/>&gt;obliged to go there. Any dominant chord is obliged to go to a tonic chord,<br/>&gt;but does not go to a subdominant chord unless it returns to dominant<br/>before<br/>&gt;going to tonic.</p><p>This little chart helps clarify the Riemann classifications that Joe Monzo<br/>first delineated and, obviously, the Germanic teaching the Daniel Wolf is<br/>speaking about which is associated with it.  Thank, Jerry, for including<br/>it...</p><p>You have to admit it is a &quot;far cry&quot; from the Forte classifications...  I<br/>also believe it is much more based on &quot;triadic chord naming&quot; than Forte&apos;s<br/>method and actually, in that way, more closely linked to the old<br/>&quot;_Stufen-theorists_&quot; that Joe Monzo is complaining about than to overall<br/>&quot;gravitational&quot; acoustical theory as described by Joe&apos;s paradigm<br/>3^(-1,0,1),  even though Joe was the first to bring this up in the context<br/>of the Riemann chart.</p><p>Surely it is more related to the 5-limit view of triadic consonance than<br/>Forte, which is more general, and Pythagoreanly linked.  I would think the<br/>Forte method might be a better analysis of older systems of music, such as<br/>meantone, and maybe even earlier,  than the system you describe.</p><p>The biggest problem, in my view, is the classification of the vi chord as a<br/>I.  Sure, and also according to Forte, it can &quot;substitute&quot; for a I.<br/>However, I much prefer Forte&apos;s description of the vi as &quot;dominant<br/>preparation&quot; since Pythagorean chain progressions such as I-vi-ii-V-I are<br/>so common...  Also, the classification of III as a &quot;tonic&quot; might be<br/>especially good in the *minor* mode, where III can take on a predominant<br/>*tonic* role but maybe not so descriptive in the major mode where, as<br/>according to Forte, it elaborates the Pythagorean chain with the obvious<br/>iii-vi-ii-V-I.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8562 href="#8562">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2000 8:51:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Joseph Pehrson, TD 531.8]<br/>&gt; ... more closely linked to the old &quot;_Stufen-theorists_&quot; that<br/>&gt; Joe Monzo is complaining about than to overall &quot;gravitational&quot;<br/>&gt; acoustical theory as described by Joe&apos;s paradigm 3^(-1,0,1) ...</p><p>Joe, I wasn&apos;t really &apos;complaining&apos; about _stufen_-theory<br/>(well, in the particular subset of it connected with<br/>Schenker I do... but not in general).</p><p>Each theory has valid points, and points which can be criticized,<br/>but in general, it works for the particular repertoire<br/>(i.e., *context*) for which it was formulated.</p><p>_Stufen_-theory (= &apos;scale-step theory&apos;) derived from figured-bass<br/>accompaniment notations during the 1600-1700s, and was developed<br/>further (as Daniel Wolf pointed out, mainly in Vienna) during the<br/>1800s.</p><p>I believe that it analyzes very capably many of the aspects<br/>of harmonic practice for the western European repertoire from<br/>that period.  And it certainly represents harmonic paradigms<br/>which a lot of those composers had in mind, since most of them<br/>*learned* it as &apos;their&apos; music-theory.</p><p>But it is *always* the case, as none other than Harry Partch would<br/>argue strenuously, that gifted composers and performers will<br/>do things that fall far outside any theory than anyone has so<br/>far formulated, and theory is always playing a game of catch-up,<br/>with the few execeptions of *proscriptive* theory such as Yasser&apos;s.</p><p>(... as opposed to *descriptive* theory, which tries to find ways<br/>to analyze those gifted creations in a way that makes some kind<br/>of logical sense out of them according to &apos;rules&apos; about which<br/>theorists are already familiar; i.e., making sense of the<br/>unfamiliar in terms of the familiar.)</p><p>&gt; [Joe Pehrson]<br/>&gt; The biggest problem, in my view, is the classification of the<br/>&gt; vi chord as a I.

Jerry, whether he knows it or not,<br/>has a pretty good grasp of Riemannian functional-harmony theory<br/>as I understand it.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
