Whadda ya got, bub?</p><p>&gt;John, your response is perfectly logical, but to balance the<br/>&gt;argument, remember that Brahms (composing c. 1851-1896) refused<br/>&gt;to make use of the valved brass instruments that were invented<br/>&gt;around the beginning of his career and exploited so effectively<br/>&gt;by Wagner and his followers.  (Brahms continued working for<br/>&gt;13 more years after Wagner&apos;s death.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Of course Brahms was criticized from many quarters for this<br/>&gt;reactionary adherence to a past aesthetic, but keep in mind<br/>&gt;that one of his reasons for retaining the old valveless horns<br/>&gt;was his love for their JI intervals  (documented in<br/>&gt;Swafford&apos;s _Brahms: A biography_).<br/>&gt;-monz</p><p>And Brahms was being perfectly logical: he used the right tool for the<br/>job. Good for him for not caving to the style police!</p><p>BTW, thanks Carl for the URLs. I had heard some Nancarrow when I was in my<br/>20s and thought it was cool, but I had forgotten about him until the<br/>recent mention on the list. It was great to hear the Real Audio files. I<br/>am jazzed!</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=6873 href="#6873">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/11/1999 2:15:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;How will you decide whether to reject or accept a submission?
