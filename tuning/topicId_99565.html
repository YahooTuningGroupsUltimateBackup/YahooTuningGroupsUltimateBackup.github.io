I originally thought it was Keemun, but apparently<br/>it&apos;s not, because Keemun eliminates 49/48. Looks like it&apos;s porcupine,<br/>just taken with every other generator. I&apos;ve noticed this for a while<br/>but was mistakenly calling it &quot;Keemun.&quot; Andrew seems to have been the<br/>first to map some of this out, so shall we call the respective<br/>subgroup temperament &quot;Orgone&quot; temperament?</p><p>It&apos;s a killer scale, the 22-edo/11-edo version is one of my favorites<br/>ever. The LsLsLsL mode sounds kind of like diminished[8] in 12-tet,<br/>only better because it has a 4:7:11 right there. Yes, it is of<br/>slightly limited tonal and harmonic use (maybe) but it&apos;s definitely a<br/>useful scale to have around.</p><p>What would the subgroup be for this? I guess you could call it<br/>2.5/3.7.9.11 and say that 250/243, 100/99, and 64/63 vanish?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=99567 href="#99567">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2011 5:55:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Andrew seems to have been the<br/>&gt; first to map some of this out, so shall we call the respective<br/>&gt; subgroup temperament &quot;Orgone&quot; temperament?</p><p>I think so; the Xenwiki already basically says orgone is the 2.7.11 subgroup temperament tempering out the orgonisma, 65536/65219, so we may as well make it official.</p><p>&gt; What would the subgroup be for this?

I agree with Gene completely.<br/>What both Andrew and I seem to have talked about in the past was the good approximation of some non-3 intervals in 37-EDO. That&apos;s one thing that should be taken into account.<br/>Another thing is, if Gene says that Andrew has talked about tempering out 65536/65219, I think that sums it all up pretty clearly that the 8:11:14 chord should be viewed the primary approximated chord. The fact that he calls the generator a &quot;minor third&quot; doesn&apos;t say absolutely nothing about it&apos;s proper size, while the 65536/65219 unison vector gives a pretty small tolerance.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=99576 href="#99576">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2011 1:20:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; What both Andrew and I seem to have talked about in the past was the good<br/>&gt; approximation of some non-3 intervals in 37-EDO.</p><p>BTW: At the time I discovered 37-EDO myself back in 2006 or so, I also found the 2D temperament simply by taking the 8:11:14:16 chord and splitting it into smaller intervals by reducing the largest step by the smaller steps, until I found the pretty small one and tempered it out.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=99577 href="#99577">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2011 8:08:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Another thing is, if Gene says that Andrew has talked about tempering out<br/>&gt; 65536/65219, I think that sums it all up pretty clearly that the 8:11:14<br/>&gt; chord should be viewed the primary approximated chord.</p><p>I was the one who brought up 65536/65129, but that was based on the characterization of 1-11/8-7/4 as the basic chord and the characterization of the 3\11 generator as marginal. If you take any of the generators mentioned, even 3\11, but certainly 10\37 or 7\26, and confine them to the 2.7.11 subgroup, you get the orgonisma as the single comma. Starting from 3\11 and 2.7.11 you get the orgonisma and nothing else, from the orgonisma and 2.7.11, you get that 11 is marginal, 37 much better, and 26 better yet. I don&apos;t see anything in what Andrew said which goes beyond this or beyond the 2.7.11 subgroup.</p><p>If you do want to extend it, another possibility aside from the one I mentioned previously would be to focus on 37 and add 5 to the mix, so that we would be looking at the 10\37 generator in the <a href="http://2.5.7.11">2.5.7.11</a> subgroup. This adds the comma 2420/2401 to the orgonisma, and would make 37\137 a good tuning. That, in turn, leads to a full 11-limit version tempering out 2430/2401, 4000/3993 and  6144/6125 in which 3 is however pretty complex.</p></div>
