Is it not more attractif when that 7th is<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;normaly&quot; distant?<br/>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s only one question :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are speaking of the major 7th, when functioning as leading tone<br/>&gt; to the tonic above.  My belief is that a small melodic step is more<br/>&gt; dramatic than a larger step.  So, for example, when a 4:5:6:7 dom 7th<br/>&gt; resolves to JI tonic, the leading tone to tonic, 15:16 or 112 cents, is<br/>&gt; not as dramatic as the 21:20, 84 cents, resolving to the tonic&apos;s third<br/>&gt; degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (if the step gets _too_ small, the ear no longer considers it dramatic,<br/>&gt; or even a step, but in the range 70 .. 200 cents, at least, I think this<br/>&gt; principle applies).</p><p>John, I don&apos;t think Mr. Dimitrov is speaking in terms of JI. I noticed that<br/>musicians with a classical education, especially in the orchestra, respect<br/>the principle of high sharps and low flats. (A conductor who wants a low C#,<br/>because it sounds out of tune against a low A, simply asks to play it as if<br/>it was a Db.)  It&apos;s &apos;logic&apos; therefore for them to raise for example the F#<br/>in the key of G. In the same time, musicians who play an instrument with<br/>flexible pitch, as the violin, always say that the F# is attracted toward<br/>the G and &apos;therefore should be sharpened&apos;.</p><p>As Mr. Dimitrov says, as a violinist (!), why not &apos;normally&apos; distant? I<br/>wonder why as well. OK, undeniable, the leading-tone (la note sensible)<br/>wants to go up to the tonic, but should we help it to make the move? On my<br/>quartertone guitar a leadingtone going up precisely a quartertone towards<br/>the tonic doesn&apos;t produce a dramatic result at all. It sounds as if the note<br/>already half arrived and just needed to be tuned up a little. If there is<br/>something as an attraction force, something you lift up and than let it<br/>fall, perhaps a certain distance should be respected to produce an effect.<br/>Besides, a F# higher than in 12-tet will sound pretty much out of tune if<br/>played within a D or a D7. chord. So, I think I understand Mr. Dimitrov&apos;s<br/>question, but still can&apos;t give a definite reply.</p><p>Wim</p></div><h3><a id=28197 href="#28197">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2001 4:28:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Wim Hoogewerf&quot; &lt;wim.hoogewerf@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John, I don&apos;t think Mr. Dimitrov is speaking in terms of JI.

Ernst Toch in his book claimed<br/>that, in a particular Brahms passage, one could sharpen the (upward-<br/>pointing) leading tones by a full quartertone, and likewise flatten<br/>the downward-pointing sevenths of the dominant seventh chord by a<br/>quartertone. I have always felt this to be ridiculous.</p><p>I think there is some &quot;incisiveness&quot; produced by using smaller<br/>melodic minor seconds, but this can&apos;t be taken to such extremes that<br/>the harmonic identity of the intervals involved is distorted beyond<br/>recognition.</p></div>
