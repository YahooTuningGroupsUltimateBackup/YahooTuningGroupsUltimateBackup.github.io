You are talking in terms of adding frequencies; it is better to think in terms of multiplying frequencies, e.g. perfect 4th is 4/3 times the root, the perfect 5th is 3/2 times the root, flat 7th is 7/4 times the root (and octave is 2/1 times the root).

IE<br/>1/1 10/7 3/2 may be a relatively &quot;perfect&quot; suspended major chord from the<br/>root...but between 3/2 and 10/7 the dyad of 21/20 is formed...which is far from<br/>a simple/&quot;perfect&quot; interval.<br/>3) Furthermore, perfection comes scrambled when stacking chord.  4:5:6:7 may be<br/>a perfect major 7th chord...but now make 5 the root...which makes a triad of<br/>5:6:7 from it...which is not as perfect as 4:5:6 and not &quot;even&quot; a perfect minor<br/>chord...and actually sounds more like a diminished triad.</p><p>4) Say you stack notes like 4;5:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13....to achieve &quot;absolute<br/>tonal perfection&quot; relative to the root tone.  This is simply a straight harmonic<br/>series.  Of course, when you make a spread-out chord starting from a high<br/>harmonic IE 7:9:11...the chord sounds not very tonal at all and the entire scale<br/>begins to sound like a giant chord (not exactly compositionally/emotionally<br/>flexible).</p><p>    Not to mention you get situations like the dyad 13/12 (or closer)...where<br/>the notes are so close they vibrate fairly violently (critical band dissonance)<br/>causing a feeling of emotional &quot;un-settledness&quot;/tension.</p><p>   In short...there is no magic bullet to &quot;tonality&quot;.<br/>  You are always trading one type of perfection for another...and the question<br/>becomes which types of perfection, as a musician, do you value most.<br/>  Hence why 12TET is designed to balance between perfection from all possible<br/>roots (though, as many here can tell you, tunings such as 31TET, 53TET, and<br/>quarter comma meantone can do a far better job at that).    So when making new<br/>scales, you end up trying to sacrifice some perfection relative to the root in<br/>order to keep perfection relative to other notes in the chord.  Programs that<br/>try to change notes dynamically when you switch root tones to partly fix this<br/>issue are called Adaptive Just Intonation.  Of course, by switching root tones<br/>you must make other notes shift to accommodate...so you end up with notes<br/>somewhat audibly sliding to form/re-form perfect chords...this is called &quot;comma<br/>shift&quot;.</p><p>----------------------</p><p>Now what can you use (for free) to make some nice/crazy microtonal music? :-)</p><p>   My favorite program for really quick micro-tonal experimentation is modplug<br/>tracker...which you can download here:<br/><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/modplug/files/OpenMPT%20Release%20Candidates/OpenMPT%20v1.17RC2%20%281.17.02.28%29/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/modplug/files/OpenMPT%20Release%20Candidates/OpenMPT%20v1.17RC2%20%281.17.02.28%29/</a></p><p>   You simply make a new MPTM file, create a new instrument (drag a<br/>wave/instrument sample into the instrument box).  Next click the &quot;configure<br/>tunings&quot; option at the bottom of the &quot;tunings&quot; drop down box.  Then you right<br/>click to create a new tuning and select a type IE geometric for a tuning that<br/>repeats on the octave/tritave/etc..  Then you select a repeating ratio/&quot;period&quot;<br/>IE 2 for the octave and a number of steps IE 12 for 12 tones to the octave. Then<br/>plug in decimal point values IE 1.2 = minor third and 1.5 = perfect fifth. Now<br/>go back to you instrument and click the combo box to select the tuning to apply<br/>it to the instrument.  Then you are done...simply use the instrument to make<br/>music.</p></div><h3><a id=95175 href="#95175">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2010 8:20:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know about Logic Pro (I am sure others will chime in) but I use Scala software:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this I can create text files to specify experimental intervals and sequences and play them back through MIDI.

If you start looking into software synths or samplers, there&apos;s already some that can use Scala scales. Pianoteq is a great physically modeled piano synth, with optional plugins for other kinds of instruments like bells, clavinet, or marimba sounds. Garritan has instrument packs like the Garritan Personal Orchestra, World Instruments, and Jazz &amp; Big Band. These are commercial products, but ZynAddSubFX is a free open source software synth that supports retuning.</p><p>One thing you&apos;ll run into if you try tuning notes to exact ratios (aka just intonation) is that some of the intervals you get will end up very close to a just interval, but far enough away that they sound out of tune. A simple example is that if you try tuning all the fifths just in a chain of fifths from Eb to G#, you&apos;ll end up with an out of tune &quot;wolf&quot; fifth G#-Eb, which is off by a comma. There are various ways to deal with this issue, but different solutions work with different kinds of music.</p></div><h3><a id=95182 href="#95182">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2010 11:36:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Zack, and welcome to the list!</p><p>On Wed, Dec 22, 2010 at 9:36 PM, zacks &lt;forgiste@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Recently, I examined the absolute frequencies of all the pitches in a 12 tet octave, and came to the realization that the Perfect 4th and the Perfect 5th are located at ~33% (1/3rd) and ~50% (1/2) of the total octave, respectively.

So a 12-tet major third is 400<br/>cents, a fifth is 700 cents, etc.</p><p>So compared with an absolute (or &quot;just&quot;) 3/2 and 4/3, 12-tet&apos;s<br/>estimations are pretty good. So good, in fact, that you wouldn&apos;t be<br/>able to tell the difference if you tried, unless you listened really<br/>hard for evidence of an almost perceptible &quot;beating&quot; around the<br/>harmonics of these notes.</p><p>The major and minor thirds aren&apos;t as good. 12-tet&apos;s major third is 14<br/>cents sharp, and if you play a just major triad in which the<br/>frequencies are in a pure 4:5:6 ratio, you can definitely hear the<br/>difference.</p><p>One exciting frontier that microtonal music makes possible is to get<br/>away from temperament entirely and explore writing only music in which<br/>all of the ratios are just (&quot;Just Intonation&quot;). This means that every<br/>chord that you play will be really resonant sounding, and you&apos;ll hear<br/>phantom low notes popping out as your brain literally tries to &quot;fuse&quot;<br/>the chords into a single note. Lots of people are fans of this<br/>approach. This also makes a lot of interesting musical sonorities<br/>possible, as you can explore writing music with frequency ratios that<br/>don&apos;t pop up in 12-tet at all (like 11/8, for example. Try a chord<br/>like 4:5:6:7:9:11:13).</p><p>Another exciting frontier, however, is to go in the opposite<br/>direction: to understand that 400 cents in 12-equal is still<br/>recognizable as a 5/4, and to exploit that property to make different<br/>interesting temperaments with different flavors. This is useful<br/>because tempering makes chord progressions possible that aren&apos;t<br/>possible in just intonation.</p><p>What do I mean by that? For example, let&apos;s explore the &quot;circle of<br/>fifths&quot; of 12-tet and see where it leads. Let&apos;s start off by saying<br/>that C is 1/1.</p><p>C - 1/1<br/>G - 3/2<br/>D - 9/4<br/>A - 27/16<br/>E - 81/32</p><p>So four fifths on top of each other is an 81/32 ratio. What happens if<br/>we take the &quot;just&quot; major third, though, like you said - a 5/4 ratio -<br/>and move it up by two octaves? An octave is 2/1.</p><p>E = 5/4 * 2/1 * 2/1 = 5/1</p><p>So there are actually &quot;two E&apos;s,&quot; so to speak. You have the E that you<br/>arrive at by stacking a bunch of fifths, and the E that you arrive at<br/>by stacking a 5/4 major third and two octaves. Although in 12-tet<br/>these are &quot;rounded off&quot; (or &quot;tempered&quot;) to the same note, in just<br/>intonation they are not. The fifths-based one will be 21.5 cents<br/>sharper than the other one, and the difference between them is an<br/>ultra-small interval (or &quot;comma&quot;) with a frequency ratio of 81/80.<br/>12-tet eliminates this comma and rounds the two off to the same note,<br/>and is hence a &quot;meantone&quot; temperament (any temperament eliminating<br/>81/80 is called a meantone. 19-tet is another one).</p><p>So if you work with a tuning in which 81/80 doesn&apos;t vanish, then you<br/>can distinguish between these two major thirds, and write music that&apos;s<br/>more &quot;pure,&quot; right? Well, maybe, but something weird ends up happening<br/>with this chord progression:</p><p>||: Cmaj -&gt; Am -&gt; Dm -&gt; Gmaj :||</p><p>If you do this chord progression in 12-equal (or any tuning in which<br/>81/80 is rounded off to 0 cents), you end up back at the same Cmaj<br/>every time. If you do this chord progression in just intonation, you<br/>will end up at a Cmaj that is 21.5 cents lower than you started at<br/>last time, and the pitch will drift lower and lower every time. So<br/>although this chord progression in 12-tet sounds perfectly &quot;natural,&quot;<br/>it&apos;s not really possible in strict JI while keeping one of the notes<br/>common between each adjacent chord. This kind of progression is called<br/>a &quot;comma pump,&quot; and the fact that in 12-tet all of those C major<br/>chords end up being the same pitch is called a &quot;pun.&quot;</p><p>Lots of people are exploring tunings in which the &quot;pure&quot; JI ratios you<br/>spoke of are intentionally detuned in different ways to create new<br/>puns, and this is what I personally find the most interesting.</p><p>And then you have the people in between who explore<br/>&quot;microtemperaments,&quot; e.g. temperaments that are indistinguishably<br/>close to JI that temper out almost infinitesimally small commas of a<br/>cent or two.

This is atonal composition, and i think it would work well with odd tunings, especially scales with a prime number of tones.</p></div><h3><a id=95206 href="#95206">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2010 9:59:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m very interested in techniques of self-similarity, of which the most famous, perfect example is the Mallalieu series, or the index series of 2 ^ N mod 13.

My grasp of terminology is pretty shaky, so I&apos;ll try to keep things very basic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll describe three methods.  Each has limitations.  They are all related, but have important differences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was able to find some irregular 7-note self-similar &quot;rows&quot; which I&apos;ll post, below.  There are certainly other ones, but these will give you some ideas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before I begin, there&apos;s a useful article by Feldman called A Review of Self-Similar Melodies (by composer Tom Johnson)  -- a minimalist composer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.kalvos.org/johness2.html">http://www.kalvos.org/johness2.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, if you have access to a Mac and a little patience, perhaps you can get some of these applications that I use to work.  I can&apos;t get to them from this computer at the moment, but I&apos;ll post links tomorrow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m typing this in fixed-width courier font -- it might make a difference below if anything needs to align.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Method 1 -- This is straight out of an old book called _A Table of Indices and Power Residues_. (Norton)  The book only uses one &quot;base&quot; -- the thing you multiply -- the lowest base, so it is not a complete list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (These are also called, I think, &quot;discrete logarithms&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s use 2 ^ N mod 11 as an example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this technique, the modulus must be a prime, and the base must be (relatively prime?) such that it makes a complete cycle of length modulus-1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can start with 1, or 2 -- since it&apos;s a cycle, it makes no difference to the final result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; multiply 2 by itself mod 11.  (When the result exceeds 11, you subtract 11 from the result and multiply that number by the base, that is, 2.) This will give you the &quot;power residue&quot; sequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1,2,4,8,5,10,9,7,3,6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Pair each of these numbers with the &quot;ordinal number&quot; -- just a number showing its place in the sequence, 0,1,2,3,4,etc.  Actually it doesn&apos;t matter if you start with 1, the result will just be a &quot;transposition&quot; in the musical sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0,1 1,2 2,4 3,8, 4,5, 5,10, 6,9, 7,7, 8,3, 9,6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Swap the pairs -- and reorder, such that what *was* the power residue sequence is now in order -- to get the &quot;indices&quot; or index sequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1,0 2,1, 3,8 4,2 5,4 6,9 7,7 8,3 9,6 10,5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, taking the second number of each pair, we have our sequence:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0,1,8,2,4,9,7,3,6,5,(x) (x is a placeholder to make cycles more regular)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Taking every other number from the second number:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1,2,9,3,5,0,8,4,7,6  (the sequence plus 1, mod 11)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Taking every third number from the third number:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8,9,6,0,2,7,5,1,4,3   (the sequence plus 8 or minus 3, mod  11.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So these are &quot;perfect&quot; sequences  -- they are all-interval within whatever modulus, and they are perfectly self-similar at each starting-point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Method 2  -- This is something I either stole from my sketchy reading of Robert Morris or perhaps I added a slight variation.  I&apos;m honestly not sure.  This works for any length sequence where you can find another sequence that makes a complete orbit with it.  It can make irregularly or regularly self-similar sequences, so it is more inclusive.  You can make the sequence of 2 ^ N mod 11, above with it, and many more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The user specifies the intervals of self-similarity only, then looks -- by trial-and-error -- for whether there is a complete orbit that will make a sequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll use length 7 for my example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the best sequence, we want some number sequence that will make a complete orbit with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. With no number the same, and the sequence 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 not backwards, but forwards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are no working combinations with 0,2,4,6,1,3,5  that produce a complete orbit.  There are many combinations where the orbit is 6 plus 1 -- where 1 number matches, but all of these have the &quot;grid row&quot; going backwards.  So the self-sim will be backwards, and the self-sim will also be flawed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would you like to find (1) orbits of size n, (2) orbits of size n - 1, or (3) both? 3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (n.b.--because I chose &quot;both&quot;, it finds the less-optimal, less-audible combinations listed below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; grid row: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6<br/>&gt; user row: 0,2,4,6,1,3,5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  2  4  6  1  3  5<br/>&gt;  grid row: 6  5  4  3  2  1  0<br/>&gt;     orbit: 6  0  5  2  1  3  4<br/>&gt; X-swapped: 1  4  3  5  6  2  0<br/>&gt; intervals: 3  6  2  1  3  5  1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  2  4  6  1  3  5<br/>&gt;  grid row: 5  4  3  2  1  0  6<br/>&gt;     orbit: 5  0  3  4  2  6  1<br/>&gt; X-swapped: 1  6  4  2  3  0  5<br/>&gt; intervals: 5  5  5  1  4  5  3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  2  4  6  1  3  5<br/>&gt;  grid row: 4  3  2  1  0  6  5<br/>&gt;     orbit: 4  0  1  6  3  2  5<br/>&gt; X-swapped: 1  2  5  4  0  6  3<br/>&gt; intervals: 1  3  6  3  6  4  5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  2  4  6  1  3  5<br/>&gt;  grid row: 3  2  1  0  6  5  4<br/>&gt;     orbit: 3  0  6  1  4  5  2<br/>&gt; X-swapped: 1  3  6  0  4  5  2<br/>&gt; intervals: 2  3  1  4  1  4  6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  2  4  6  1  3  5<br/>&gt;  grid row: 2  1  0  6  5  4  3<br/>&gt;     orbit: 2  0  4  3  5  1  6<br/>&gt; X-swapped: 1  5  0  3  2  4  6<br/>&gt; intervals: 4  2  3  6  2  2  2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  2  4  6  1  3  5<br/>&gt;  grid row: 1  0  6  5  4  3  2<br/>&gt;     orbit: 1  0  2  5  6  4  3<br/>&gt; X-swapped: 1  0  2  6  5  3  4<br/>&gt; intervals: 6  2  4  6  5  1  4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  2  4  6  1  3  5<br/>&gt;  grid row: 0  6  5  4  3  2  1<br/>&gt;     orbit: 6  2  3  1  5  4  0<br/>&gt; X-swapped: 6  3  1  2  5  4  0<br/>&gt; intervals: 4  5  1  3  6  3  6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But we could try a less-regular self-similarity pattern such as 0,3,5,1,2,4,6.

The computer found a combination that had a 6-number orbit with the 3 going to itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  user row: 0  3  5  1  2  4  6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  grid row: 2  3  4  5  6  0  1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     orbit: 2  0  4  5  1  6  3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We just stick the 3 on the end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This gives us the one-line permutation of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2,0,4,5,1,6,3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mapping these numbers to pitches-names we have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; e....g....b....f....a....d....c....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ....................a---------c-----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; e---------b--------------d---------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----g---------f<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------------------d----------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------------f....a..............<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; e....g.........................c....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ..........b..............<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These should align on your screen such that you can see that the pitch-sequence a,c,e,b,d,g,f is embedded in e,g,b,f,a,d,c at intervals of every 2 notes except for b to d, where the interval is 3 notes, and f back to a, where the interval is only 1 note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As far as I have found, there are no &quot;perfect&quot; 7-note self-similar sequences. They are all based on orbits 6 plus 1, and/or they all have irregular intervals of self-similarity.  (Not to mention that in a diatonic scale, the self-similarity will always be slightly inexact, because the scale is 6 fourths plus one tritone.)  In 7EDO, the self-similarity would be more exact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Method 3 -- probably of even less interest.  You can take any length of any power-residue sequence and it will be inexactly, or loosely, or fuzzily self-similar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s take length 12, and pick a modulus arbitrarily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Say, mod 53.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first 12 numbers of the indices of the power-residue series is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Raw:      52  49  1   46  15  50  10  43  2   12  34  47<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we rank them from highest to lowest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rank:     11  9   0   7   4   10  2   6   1   3   5   8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and assign that to 12EDO pitches:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rank:     11  9   0   7   4   10  2   6   1   3   5   8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B..A..C..G..E..Bb.D..F#.C#.D#.F.G#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now look for partial, inexact self-similarity by aligning with every-other note from the second note:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B..A..C..G..E..Bb.D..F#.C#.D#.F..G#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A..G..Bb.F#.D#.G#.B..C..E..D..C#.F..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; intervals in 12EDO:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 10.10.10.11.11.10.9..6..3..11.8..9..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first half of the row is self-similar +-1 (9,10,11)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Different mod-base combinations will be a little better or a little worse by this method.  This one was pretty typical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fuzzy self-similarity might be useful, because imitation in tonal music is often inexact -- a major third instead of a minor third, that kind of thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacques, I&apos;ll attempt to send you the Macintosh apps that I&apos;m using, in a separate post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Phew.

My idea is that the perception of<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; and the perception of the VF for a just sonority<br/>&gt;&gt; are caused by two different psychoacoustic mechanisms. I think that<br/>&gt;&gt; both of these percepts play a role when one hears a JI interval or<br/>&gt;&gt; triad and &quot;identifies it,&quot; and I think the two are subject sometimes<br/>&gt;&gt; to introspective confusion.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I think this leads to a lot of confusion around here, especially when<br/>&gt;&gt; folks start talking about &quot;fields of attraction&quot; and the like: 9/7,<br/>&gt;&gt; for instance, is in 5/4&apos;s field of attraction in one sense, but not at<br/>&gt;&gt; all in the other.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=95257 href="#95257">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2010 4:29:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Caleb wrote :</p><p>&gt; Hi Jacques,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m posting this on the tuning in list in case anyone else is<br/>&gt; interested.

A true dada&iuml;st composer and an<br/>immense poet of the melody. I was just listening recently to his<br/>album &quot;Rational melodies&quot;, recorded in Paris by the Dedalus Ensemble.<br/>Waow, this article is serious too ! But I don&apos;t know this other work<br/>of him, have to get into it.</p><p>&gt; Method 1 -- This is straight out of an old book called _A Table of<br/>&gt; Indices and<br/>&gt; Power Residues_. (Norton) The book only uses one &quot;base&quot; -- the<br/>&gt; thing you<br/>&gt; multiply -- the lowest base, so it is not a complete list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (These are also called, I think, &quot;discrete logarithms&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s use 2 ^ N mod 11 as an example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this technique, the modulus must be a prime, and the base must<br/>&gt; be (relatively<br/>&gt; prime?) such that it makes a complete cycle of length modulus-1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can start with 1, or 2 -- since it&apos;s a cycle, it makes no<br/>&gt; difference to the<br/>&gt; final result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; multiply 2 by itself mod 11. (When the result exceeds 11, you<br/>&gt; subtract 11 from<br/>&gt; &gt;the result and multiply that number by the base, that is, 2.) This<br/>&gt; will give you<br/>&gt; &gt;the &quot;power residue&quot; sequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1,2,4,8,5,10,9,7,3,6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Pair each of these numbers with the &quot;ordinal number&quot; -- just a<br/>&gt; number showing<br/>&gt; &gt;its place in the sequence, 0,1,2,3,4,etc. Actually it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; matter if you<br/>&gt; &gt;start with 1, the result will just be a &quot;transposition&quot; in the<br/>&gt; musical sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0,1 1,2 2,4 3,8, 4,5, 5,10, 6,9, 7,7, 8,3, 9,6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Swap the pairs -- and reorder, such that what *was* the power<br/>&gt; residue sequence<br/>&gt; &gt;is now in order -- to get the &quot;indices&quot; or index sequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1,0 2,1, 3,8 4,2 5,4 6,9 7,7 8,3 9,6 10,5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, taking the second number of each pair, we have our sequence:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0,1,8,2,4,9,7,3,6,5,(x) (x is a placeholder to make cycles more<br/>&gt; regular)</p><p>Amazing ! I could do it with different lengths, so I think I got it,<br/>thanks !<br/>However I noticed it does not always work in any base :<br/>I could resolve this nice modulo 17 one, in base 2 :<br/>0, 14, 1, 12, 5, 15, 11, 10, 2, 3, 7, 13, 4, 9, 6, 8</p><p>and mod 29 as well with base 2, and this mod 7 one, but with base 3 :<br/>0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3</p><p>and mod 23 with base 5,  and 41 with base 7, cool !</p><p>... Can one same length have several solutions (I mean with different<br/>patterns) ?</p><p>&gt; So these are &quot;perfect&quot; sequences -- they are all-interval within<br/>&gt; whatever<br/>&gt; modulus, and they are perfectly self-similar at each starting-point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Method 2 -- This is something I either stole from my sketchy<br/>&gt; reading of Robert<br/>&gt; Morris or perhaps I added a slight variation. I&apos;m honestly not<br/>&gt; sure. This works<br/>&gt; for any length sequence where you can find another sequence that<br/>&gt; makes a<br/>&gt; complete orbit with it. It can make irregularly or regularly self-<br/>&gt; similar<br/>&gt; sequences, so it is more inclusive. You can make the sequence of 2<br/>&gt; ^ N mod 11,<br/>&gt; above with it, and many more.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting for sure, but I will stick to the the 1st<br/>technique for now !<br/>Also because I want first to make a few experiments with the<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; sequences.<br/>Actually these researches on discrete logarithms are completely<br/>related with some technique I&apos;ve been using for my photosonic disks,<br/>that I call &quot;angles cycles&quot;, that generates many different waveforms,<br/>also related with FM synthesis (frequency modulation).<br/>So I want to check if these sequences produce more particular sounds !<br/>Will let you know.<br/>I also want to test them as polyrhythmic sequences, because that&apos;s<br/>what they are basically I think.<br/>Then of course they can be applied for sequencing scales, and it&apos;s<br/>true that edos of the same lengths, having the same periodic number<br/>of steps will provide certain musical illustrations. But not only<br/>edos, not only octave divisions, and in many other possible forms<br/>than in the classical serial music.</p><p>Thanks for sharing your enthusiasm, and let us hear what music you<br/>make with that stuff !<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=95260 href="#95260">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2010 6:07:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ...
