<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>virtually my entire work online virtually</h1><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2004 8:00:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It used to be that the Internet was a &quot;sampler&quot; medium... the ol&apos;<br/>days of .wav files, pre .mp3.  Even at the onset of mp3s, things were<br/>a bit &quot;shakey&quot; since most people had slow connections, 56Kb and so<br/>forth, and connect time was expensive.  In addition, the computer<br/>sound cards didn&apos;t render too well, and people didn&apos;t use quality<br/>headphones or speakers with computers.</p><p>Because of this, I always used to just put *parts* of my compositions<br/>on line.  Now all has changed.  I&apos;ve gone back and put the *entire*<br/>of vitually all my pieces online.</p><p>Why have I done this?  Well, for starters, I resent spending $5,000<br/>to $10,000 for a well-circulated commercial CD (oh sure, I could<br/>easily do this, and on pretty good labels too, if I had the $).</p><p>So, I&apos;ve decided to go the &quot;non-commercial&quot; route in the hope that<br/>the increased visibility will lead to more performances/recognition,<br/>if not $.</p><p>The site isn&apos;t *entirely* non-commercial, since I have postings about<br/>how to purchase the sheet music for further performances, but I have<br/>kept the downloads free for the time being.</p><p>What does any of this have to do with microtonality??  Well, there<br/>are *several* microtonal works on this page, of course.  I&apos;ve been<br/>working with microtonality since about 1985, with the greatest<br/>concentration about 2000 when I joined this list.</p><p>In any case, enjoy... I would point out the _Trumpet in a New<br/>Surrounding_ which uses quite a few microtonal effects, even if not<br/>in an *endemic* system... This was one minor brush with the &quot;big<br/>time,&quot; since it was performed on the _Second Helpings_ series here in<br/>New York by the St. Luke&apos;s Chamber Ensemble.  My friend from Eastman,<br/>Eric Ewazen was curating the concerts at that time.  Now Joan Tower<br/>is doing it, and I wouldn&apos;t have a chance... :)</p><p>Here&apos;s the augmented page:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/pro/?BandID=104245">http://www.soundclick.com/pro/?BandID=104245</a></p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
