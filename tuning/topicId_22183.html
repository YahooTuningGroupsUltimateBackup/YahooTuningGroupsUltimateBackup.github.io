As I write music I hope that it will be played<br/>by living instrumentalists at some point. So I try to specify instruments that can be tuned to the<br/>ratios or temperaments I want. I&apos;d also hope that the music will be played live, to an audience. I<br/>just can&apos;t get round to the notion that midi keyboards and samplers playing a modelled version of<br/>a real instrument will ever have the same magic as the instrument itself. I say this as I struggle<br/>to put up an mp3 of a midi JI version and a guitar (22 tet) version of a piece I wrote a while<br/>back with the aim of letting people compare. Patience needed. I asked myself who would ever in the<br/>fulness of time take more than a passing interest in a piece realised on a sampler without a score<br/>or the availability of instruments? This led me to making a start at constructing the instruments<br/>I need. Which is why Partch is such an awesome figure, whether you like his music or not, for<br/>having created a universe from the needle to the thread.</p><p>If he (Partch) and others can do everything from scratch I wonder why microtonalists have this<br/>problem with keyboard design after years of R&amp;D and the availability of tools, expertise and free<br/>time. Let&apos;s say we are going to stick with keyboards as such. As a non keyboard specialist I<br/>looked at the issue objectively. Some people like to play keyboards and some even do it well. And<br/>we have a wonderful range of timbres from harpsichord to organ all actualised by the striking of a<br/>key. What happens after the key is struck doesn&apos;t concern me here. It&apos;s the mapping problem that<br/>needs solving. The key simply makes something else happen. I&apos;m interested in the layout of the<br/>keys. So what is needed is a removable bit, a tray or panel, that holds the keys so that any<br/>combination of white and black can be arranged. And with every piano or organ or clavichord you<br/>get a free bag of extras should you need an unusually large number of black or white keys. So,<br/>that&apos;s great idea number 1. I await all the objections to this idea.</p><p>Great idea No 2 concerns guitars. I know that Wim Hoogewerf has a guitar with movable individual<br/>frets. This needs to be the model for the &quot;only guitar you&apos;ll ever need&quot;. It will become useful<br/>one day to be able to give a guitar recital in JI, 19, 22, 31 and n out of m without having to lug<br/>around 5 guitars. The main problems are I imagine the ease with which the frets move to new<br/>positions and the certainty that they will stay put once you&apos;ve tuned up and also some method of<br/>marking the fretboard for the most used ratios/temperaments a la hobnailed thingy post that the<br/>late great Ivor Darreg made.</p><p>So, get on with it somebody, I just don&apos;t have the time.</p><p>In the spirit of good music making</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3><a id=22417 href="#22417">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/10/2001 12:48:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison Monteith wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; high version:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0^--1^--2^--3^--4^--5^--6^--7^--8^--9^--0<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---0v<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0v      2v          5v      7v<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; low version:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     1^          4^      6^          9^--0<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---0v<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 0v--1v--2v--3v--4v--5v--6v--7v--8v--9v<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I normally let things I don&apos;t understand pass till later but I&apos;d be<br/>&gt; grateful if somebody could<br/>&gt; clarify how this is read as a keyboard mapping.

Patience needed. I asked<br/>&gt; myself who would ever in the<br/>&gt; fulness of time take more than a passing interest in a piece realised<br/>&gt; on a sampler without a score<br/>&gt; or the availability of instruments? This led me to making a start at<br/>&gt; constructing the instruments<br/>&gt; I need.

An octave is 10s+q.  Look at the number of steps in the<br/>&gt; octave:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 72<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s 7*10 + 2.  So s=7 and q=2.

In fact, it can be set up so that the frets<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; near<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the nut are mostly the same.

Any help?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a Blackjack scale shown in decimal notation.

That works better, and I&apos;m<br/>not worried about it being accurate so long as it&apos;s as good.</p><p>Is that it for this message?  I think I&apos;ll paste from another, to pretend<br/>to be on topic.</p><p>&gt; If we introduce pitch sets that clearly<br/>&gt; outline the 7 and 11 identities we then have a choice of new harmonic<br/>&gt; AND melodic resources. Does a<br/>&gt; composer then treat 7 and 11 as exotic additions to familiar melodic and<br/>&gt; harmonic structures? If<br/>&gt; so then melodies become more interesting and harmonies more crunchy<br/>&gt; but the framework remains the<br/>&gt; same.</p><p>This sounds like the &quot;neo-tonal&quot; approach to me.  Use meantone notation,<br/>and add subminor thirds or supermajor thirds.  The tonal motivation is to<br/>narrow semitones.  I have looked at this, it seems to work.  You can<br/>really take all chromatic harmony the wrong way round.</p><p>&gt; Or do we vote democrat and liberate</p><p>Now Alison, this really isn&apos;t appropriate during an election campaign.<br/>There&apos;s an obvious subliminal message there.  You wouldn&apos;t catch me doing<br/>anything like that.</p><p>&gt; 7 and 11, granting them parity, in which case I would<br/>&gt;have a problem with processing faster music. But I would be challenged by<br/>&gt;the vast increase in<br/>&gt;resources.</p><p>This is the perspective Erlich/Keenan temperament give us.  The easiest<br/>intervals happen to include a wide selection from the 11-limit.  In fact,<br/>it&apos;s the 7-limit plus neutral thirds that are easiest.</p><p>I plan to use both systems, and others besides, but as it&apos;s a new idea my<br/>vote would go with this new scale.  Ideally we&apos;d grab new musicians still<br/>green and free of the indoctrinations the conservatories provide, not<br/>party to the equal-temperament establishment.</p><p>&gt;I would suggest that the more radical and pioneering approach would<br/>&gt;be to look at 7 and 11 as much<br/>&gt;more than extensions of existing structures. (It would help also<br/>&gt;to demystify the higher<br/>&gt;identities, especially 11, by exposing control groups to pronounced<br/>&gt;11 limit melodies and long<br/>&gt;sustained 7 and 11 limit chords just to prove that you will not in<br/>&gt;fact convert to Satanism.)</p><p>I think there&apos;s something to the 11-limit, but I still wouldn&apos;t call it<br/>&quot;consonance&quot;.  Still, it&apos;s nice to have those dissonances around, and<br/>neutral thirds are good for melody.  And the Erlich-Keenan temperament is<br/>optimal for the 7-limit anyway.</p><p>&gt; In<br/>&gt;the mid term the sort of music that would appeal to me would be at<br/>&gt;slower tempos with more<br/>&gt;sustained vertical structures. The art would lie in the formal<br/>&gt;engineering of the piece. The door<br/>&gt;would open to more homophonic music and to modal and dronal<br/>&gt;techniques which would allow composers<br/>&gt;to plunder the riches of pre-tonal theorists.</p><p>That&apos;s one approach, but hardly the only one.  The 11-limit does lead away<br/>from tonal modulation, because there are all these intervals to<br/>investigate you don&apos;t need to move the same scales up and down.  But it<br/>doesn&apos;t have to be slow!</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=22488 href="#22488">ðŸ”—</a>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2001 3:18:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 5/11/01 1:44 AM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Miracle Munitions<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alison Monteith wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Great idea No 2 concerns guitars.

Mark Rankin, the current<br/>(?) maker of this system, lives in an Oldsmobile or something, checks his<br/>post office box once a year or some such. My mail inquiries never made it to<br/>him.
