He&apos;s willing to<br/>accept that these things are MOS with respect to the period of<br/>1/4-oct, and so that a full octave of them is just a string of<br/>iterated MOS&apos;s, much like four octaves of the diatonic scale. He<br/>proposed the name &quot;Multi-MOS&quot; for these things, which isn&apos;t the same<br/>as proposing the name &quot;MOS&quot; for them, but it&apos;s a start, anyway.</p><p>I actually like this name a lot, because it&apos;s nice and compact and<br/>easier to type than &quot;fractional-octave period MOS&quot; or whatever, which<br/>is cumbersome and has been shown to contribute to things like<br/>tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p>As you might expect, we differ in whether Multi-MOS&apos;s are types of<br/>MOS, or MOS&apos;s are types of Multi-MOS, or whether they&apos;re mutually<br/>exclusive categories. Paul says he wants them to be mutually<br/>exclusive. I, however, am indulging in my newfound love of<br/>terminological pedantry to insist that any definition of scales like<br/>diminished[8] as &quot;not being MOS&quot; is technically incorrect, because<br/>even for these scales it&apos;s true that every generic interval comes in<br/>two sizes except the &quot;generic octave&quot; (or period).</p><p>This is my definition of things:</p><p>1) Let the period p of a scale be the interval at which the scale repeats.<br/>2) Let the equivalence interval e of an scale be the interval at which<br/>pitch classes and note names repeat.<br/>3) A scale is MOS if it has exactly two sizes of specific interval per<br/>generic interval up to p.<br/>4) A Multi-MOS scale is a scale that is MOS, and for which e/p = k for<br/>k &gt; 1 in N.</p><p>I think that this is a rather handy and simple way to define things.<br/>However, this now creates an ambiguity between the term &quot;MOS&quot; (this<br/>umbrella class of scales including Multi-MOS) and &quot;MOS&quot; (the name for<br/>non-Multi-MOS). I suggest that in the rare cases when one needs a term<br/>to stand for &quot;MOS, but not Multi-MOS,&quot; that perhaps &quot;Uni-MOS&quot; might do<br/>the trick.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2012 1:21:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Mar 3, 2012 at 4:15 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you might expect, we differ in whether Multi-MOS&apos;s are types of<br/>&gt; MOS, or MOS&apos;s are types of Multi-MOS, or whether they&apos;re mutually<br/>&gt; exclusive categories.
