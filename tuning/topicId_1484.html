Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/1999 11:38:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and after seeing some of the recent comments about the<br/>perceived qualities and affects of intervals built from ratios with<br/>various prime factors, I&apos;d like to offer a few possible cautions and<br/>stray observations.</p><p>First, a caution to my cautions: if someone hears an interval in a<br/>certain way, or feels a certain aesthetic or emotional reaction,<br/>that&apos;s just as much a part of reality as anything I&apos;m about to<br/>state.  My concern is not to say what is the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; way to<br/>hear a 3-based interval, for example, but rather to question a<br/>possible assumption that &quot;everyone&quot; necessarily hears it the same way,<br/>especially when musical settings and expectations change.</p><p>Secondly, I&apos;d like to agree with a point which I recall Gary Morrison<br/>made: a lot of this discussion may be focusing on categorical<br/>perceptions of common intervals in certain musical traditions<br/>(e.g. Western European composition), as opposed to the fine nuances of<br/>tuning systems.  For example, as this previous contributor pointed out,<br/>someone discussing &quot;3-ness&quot; may actually be focusing on the generic<br/>qualities of fifths (3:2) and fourths (4:3), rather than on alleged<br/>qualities that these intervals share with 27:16 (M6) or 243:128 (M7).</p><p>Having offered these opening remarks, I&apos;ll now turn to my main point:<br/>the impression a given interval based on a given prime factor (or<br/>factors) makes can depend both on the immediate musical context and on<br/>the listener&apos;s expectations.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>1. Intervallic relativity: context counts<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>For example, the most characteristic intervals of either the 3-limit<br/>(3:2, 4:3) or the 5-limit (5:4, 6:5) may sound quite &quot;simple&quot; or even<br/>&quot;bare&quot; when set in a context where more complex sonorities are the<br/>rule.  Rich and full 3-limit Gothic harmonies can sound &quot;empty&quot; when<br/>placed in the environment of a 5-limit Renaissance texture; and the<br/>5-limit harmony of Monteverdi or Mozart can sound &quot;bland&quot; or<br/>&quot;restrained and formal&quot; when surrounded by the ninth and eleventh<br/>chords of contemporary jazz or pop, or for that matter by the<br/>saturated tetrads of 7-limit just intonation (JI).</p><p>I would propose that this effect might best be seen as an attribute,<br/>not of 3-limit or 5-limit harmony, but of the musical situation in<br/>which a given sonority is judged in the context of a setting replete<br/>with more complex stable sonorities.  So understood, this effect can<br/>be exploited by composers, as it has been at least since the 16th<br/>century.</p><p>The converse of this is that a new interval tuning can have a special<br/>enchantment, maybe especially when the categorical interval itself is<br/>on the brink of becoming stable in a given style.  Thus a sonority of<br/>4:5:6 seems &quot;odd&quot; in a Gothic 3-limit system, and likewise 4:5:6:7 in<br/>a Classical 5-limit context, despite some theoretical discussion in<br/>both eras (e.g. Walter Odington, c. 1300, for 5:4 and 6:5; Kirnberger,<br/>maybe in his 1771 treatise(?), for the &quot;harmonic seventh&quot;).</p><p>New sonorities of this kind seem to have a siren-like charm, gently<br/>seducing the attuned listener to accept not only a new interval or<br/>prime factor in tuning but a new way of listening to and making music.<br/>A possible danger of this experience is that one may draw the<br/>conclusion that only through obtuseness or even deliberate<br/>obscurantism could previous theorists or composers have _failed_ to<br/>take advantage of such an &quot;obvious&quot; resource!</p><p>&quot;How could Jacobus of Liege have failed to perceive the beauty of a<br/>pure 5:4 as opposed to an 81:64, or Zarlino neglected to describe the<br/>beauty of a pure 7:4 as opposed to a 9:5, except by stubbornly<br/>adhering to a concept of music theory elevating mathematical dogma<br/>above direct sense experience?&quot;</p><p>In fact, part of the process of &quot;acculturation&quot; to Gothic or<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic harmony is the discovery of how a &quot;less<br/>consonant&quot; tuning for an interval such as 81:64 or 9:5 nicely fits<br/>within the style.  Such cases suggest that from a musical point of<br/>view, the most significant &quot;mistuning&quot; of an interval may be a<br/>listener&apos;s extra-stylistic and thus &quot;mistuned&quot; expectations.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Intervals and impressions: variety is the spice of life<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Turning to ways in which we can response to an interval or<br/>combination, I&apos;d like to say that indeed different people can hear<br/>things in different ways -- not to mention the same person at<br/>different times.</p><p>For example, considering the example mentioned in earlier posts of the<br/>pure 3-limit fifth or fourth (3:2, 4:3), I might describe the effect<br/>as one of &quot;spaciousness&quot; or &quot;opulent clarity.&quot; Maybe this response<br/>isn&apos;t unrelated to the fact that I really like these intervals, and<br/>for some 30 years have often tended to seek out music favoring them<br/>(e.g. European Gothic, some Chinese and African polyphonies, some<br/>20th-century compositions by Debussy and Bartok, etc.).</p><p>However, 20th-century harmony texts confirm that these intervals _can_<br/>be used to convey such impressions as &quot;coldness&quot; and &quot;emptiness,&quot; as<br/>well as more neutral &quot;vastness.&quot; This might raise a question: is my<br/>perception of &quot;spaciousness&quot; some kind of permutation of &quot;vastness<br/>plus delight&quot;?</p><p>Then, again, I&apos;ve noticed that a 5:4, or better yet a 5:1 (as can<br/>occur with certain ambient sounds, maybe even the running of a<br/>computer&apos;s fan), can have an &quot;ethereal&quot; feeling maybe not unkindred to<br/>this, or even an &quot;eerie&quot; quality.</p><p>Such responses may reinforce the association of such pure intervals<br/>and intonation systems with spirituality: Perotin and Notre Dame (the<br/>cathedral being under construction during his lifetime), or Palestrina<br/>and the Sistine Chapel, or Rossi and the synagogues of Venice.</p><p>At the same time, these same intervals and intonation systems can take<br/>on the color of music and text in a variety of genres.  Thus the<br/>3-limit harmony of the 13th century feels &quot;intimate&quot; and &quot;sweet&quot; to me<br/>in a love song such as _Je n&apos;amerai autre_ (actually a vocal line<br/>added to a three-voice hocket), and likewise &quot;friendly and cheerful&quot;<br/>in an instrumental hocket such as _PORTARE_.  Another likely<br/>instrumental piece of the era, _In seculum viellatoris_ (an early<br/>example of explicit instrumentation?), has a &quot;sweet&quot; quality for me,<br/>somehow inviting an association with &quot;Appalachian fiddle music&quot; -- a<br/>style I&apos;m actually much less acquainted with than Gothic music.</p><p>In fact, maybe since around 1968, I&apos;ve considered _Je n&apos;amerai autre_<br/>a great theme song for some movie, a kind of &quot;13th-century jazz.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, 5-limit music of the 16th century has an incredible range<br/>of expressive possibilities, and theorists such as Vicentino, Zarlino,<br/>and Morley seem much occupied with the use of intervals to reinforce<br/>the affections of a text.  Songs of this era can be quite plangent or<br/>even bawdy, tertian JI and all.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>3. Systemic and polysystemic approaches<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>Specific subjective responses to specific intervals and tunings are,<br/>of course, valid and valuable -- relativity doesn&apos;t imply irrelevance.<br/>Of special interest to me are cases where a tuning seems to bring out<br/>a categorical potential of an interval or combination in an ideal way.</p><p>For example, focusing on 3-limit intervals, I might find a pure 6:8:9<br/>&quot;a resonant and energetic fusion,&quot; and a 16:24:27 &quot;_vibrant_.&quot; In the<br/>first case, the justness not only of the fifth and fourth but of the<br/>9:8 major second contribute to the total effect of relative blend or<br/>concord.  In the second case, the &quot;bouncy&quot; quality of the major sixth<br/>at 27:16 adds vibrancy or color, as well as the tension of the 9:8.<br/>This isn&apos;t to say that the same sonorities might not have a similar<br/>effect in 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet), or even in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone; but a pure 3-limit tuning seems to &quot;optimize&quot; the effect.</p><p>Also, I find it maybe more helpful, rather than seeking a single ethos<br/>for a whole system such as 3-limit, to explore some of the specific<br/>qualities of particular intervals within such a system.  Such qualities<br/>will often be linked to specific musical styles and usages, leaving<br/>open the possibility of yet-undiscovered qualities to be evoked by<br/>styles not yet invented.</p><p>For example, as already noted, I find a 27:16 pleasantly &quot;bouncy&quot; or<br/>&quot;vibrant,&quot; an effect likely tied to the Gothic expectation that the<br/>interval will typically expand to an octave, or resolve obliquely to a<br/>fifth.  The 13th-century description _tonus cum diapente_ or<br/>&quot;whole-tone plus fifth&quot; suggests some qualities of what might be<br/>called &quot;9-ness&quot; (3:2 x 9:8), and indeed M6 and M2 are often ranked<br/>together as mild discords or (in Jacobus) &quot;imperfect concords.&quot;</p><p>As in many musical settings, it&apos;s difficult to separate harmony from<br/>melody.  An interval is not only how it sounds alone, but how it tends<br/>to move.  What might &quot;unify&quot; such diverse Gothic 3-limit intervals as<br/>81:64 (M3), 27:16 (M6), and 16:9 (m7) is the way they can all resolve<br/>to a stable and conclusive fifth or octave by conjunct contrary motion<br/>involving a concise 256:243 melodic semitone in one of the voices:</p><p>  a    b        e&apos;   f&apos;        d&apos;    c&apos;<br/>  f    e        g    f         e     f<br/>81:64 3:2     27:16 2:1      16:9   3:2</p><p>The 243:128 (M7) can pack quite a bit of &quot;zap,&quot; and its oblique<br/>resolution to an octave by a 256:243 semitonal ascent in the upper<br/>voice is an attention-catching opening of some organa by Leonin and<br/>Perotin:</p><p>   e&apos;  -  f&apos;<br/>   f<br/>243:128  2:1</p><p>Likewise, at or near this more dissonant end of the spectrum, the<br/>128:81 (often ranked with or near 243:128) has a very expressive<br/>resolution by a descending 256:243 semitone sometimes used in a final<br/>cadence:</p><p>   c&apos;   -    b<br/>   e<br/>128:81      3:2</p><p>At the same time, a variety of intervals such as 81:64, 128:81, and<br/>243:128 also invite resolutions where both voices move by generously<br/>large 9:8 whole-tones, and these progressions lend their special<br/>flavor to 13th-century harmony:</p><p>  a     g            c&apos;    d&apos;         e&apos;     d&apos;         c&apos;     d<br/>  f     g            e     d          f      g          b      a<br/>81:64  1:1        128:81  2:1      243:128  3:2      256:243  4:3</p><p>Such nuances, of course, are shaped by style as well as by the<br/>inherent &quot;geometries&quot; of the intervals themselves; but exploring<br/>specific tunings and styles in this way may be more revealing than<br/>simply seeking one adjective to characterize &quot;3-limit&quot; or &quot;5-limit,&quot;<br/>etc.</p><p>Another way of looking at this kind of approach is that each tuning<br/>has its own potential contrasts, as well as affinities.  Thus while a<br/>3:2 or 4:3 in 3-limit may be &quot;spacious,&quot; a 256:243 is &quot;tense&quot; or<br/>&quot;keen,&quot; the first adjective maybe fitting its quality as a<br/>simultaneous interval and the second as a melodic semitone.  In<br/>5-limit, 5:4 and 6:5 may be &quot;sweet,&quot; but 9:5 is rather &quot;tense.&quot; In<br/>7-limit, a 7:4 may have an &quot;enchanting mildness&quot; and a 7:6 may be<br/>&quot;Bluesy,&quot; but a 9:7 (especially as an interval to the lowest part,<br/>e.g. 14:18:21 as opposed to 6:7:9) is &quot;strident.&quot;</p><p>In JI compositions drawing resources from several n-limit systems, we<br/>get into the dilemmas and opportunities of &quot;polysystemic&quot; analysis:<br/>how do these systems, and the intervals within a given system, relate<br/>when mixed? It&apos;s easy to demonstrate that 3-limit intervals can sound<br/>&quot;empty&quot; when the listener&apos;s ear has been saturated with 7-limit<br/>tetrads -- but could a composer artfully combine both systems, making<br/>them both seem &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;saturated,&quot; but in different ways?</p><p>Just as harmony and counterpoint have focused on an artful progression<br/>of intervals or combinations within a given n-limit system, so<br/>polysystemic analysis would seek out artful progressions or mixtures<br/>of sonorities derived from diverse n-limit systems.  Maybe such<br/>explorations could be the subject of a new thread.</p><p>-------------<br/>4.
