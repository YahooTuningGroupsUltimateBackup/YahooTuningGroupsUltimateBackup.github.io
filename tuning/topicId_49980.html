And his use of the Pyth. comma is not as simple as<br/>saying nothing is closer than that.  It seems there is a lack of<br/>understanding of Peter&apos;s passband concept.  His concept is to<br/>compare a chain of Otonal 2:3&apos;s with a chain of Utonal 2:3&apos;s<br/>(3:4&apos;s) and then to define &quot;passbands&quot; such that, as an example,<br/>the third diatonic step of the scale could be any note between the<br/>Pythagorean diminished 4th (8192/6561 c.384 cents) and the<br/>Pythagorean major third (81/64 c.408 cens).  While Peter chose<br/>his exact scale then for correlative reasons, his passpand<br/>concept would theoretically accept any just ratio of any limit that<br/>fell within that range.  This is why he would not use 7/4, because<br/>it does not fit the Pythagorean passband for that scale degree.</p><p>Now, I am not defending this passband idea as sensible, but<br/>please understand what it is.  I am very curious if anyone is<br/>aware of this sort of idea being suggested by anyone else<br/>previously.

We want the maximum number of &quot;correlations&quot; (dyads anywhere<br/>&gt; in the scale which also occur in a single given mode).</p><p>Yes - the mode being I.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. No two notes shall be separated by less than a Pythagorean<br/>&gt; comma.</p><p>No - the pythagorean comma is the width of each passband within which<br/>the respective note ratio must fall. Between each passband is a<br/>stopband, or forbidden zone. For 12-tone, passband x stopband = 1<br/>semitone (approx) = 1.059. So the width of each stopband is about<br/>1.045 whereas each passband is roughly 1.014 wide. Another way of<br/>viewing a passband is as the &apos;tolerance&apos; (in the engineering sense)<br/>allowed each ratio. So you can select any ratio that falls with the<br/>compass of the passband, that being a pythagorean comma.</p><p>Note, however, that the center of each passband does *not* correspond<br/>to the value of the respective ET vibration ratio. Although the tonic<br/>can never be anything but 1:1 (or 1/1 as seems to be the common usage<br/>in this group) and the octave can only be 1:2, the tonic passband<br/>stretches from 0.986 to 1.000 and the octave passband stretches from<br/>2.000 to 2.027 so as you can see the centers are a little further<br/>apart than the ET vibration ratios, although the centers are equi-<br/>proportional. The centers are in fact 2.0273^(1/12) apart (evaluating<br/>to 1.0606602) and commence at 0.9932474. Since, in a complete cycle<br/>of 12 perfect ascending 5ths, the &apos;octave&apos; ends up high of the mark<br/>so that when transposed down it becomes 2.0273, the passband lower<br/>boundaries can be calculated by dividing each upper boundary by a<br/>pythagorean comma. The lower boundary values then correspond to the<br/>values that result from transposing upwards a cycle of 12 perfect<br/>*descending* 5ths.</p><p>Hope that clarifies the matter a little.</p><p>The same process applied to the primes 2 and 5 (instead of 2 and 3),<br/>taken to the node at 125:128, gives us &apos;triphony&apos;, or the augmented<br/>triad.</p><p>- Peter</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of this seems perfectly reasonable.

Do you really<br/>believe you understand (beyond any doubt) Carl&apos;s intention is this?  I<br/>believe Carl is working harder than anyone at helping to interpret your work<br/>on behalf of and for the benfit of the rest of us.  I&apos;m glad for the dialog<br/>he is having with you.  Please realize Carl is working at something here.<br/>He is not trying to obscure or evade.  Like all of us, he might even have<br/>some habits that unknowingly obscure something, but so might you.  If<br/>something seems to indicate sophistry to you, can look beyond that<br/>appearance and see Carl&apos;s intention?  He&apos;s trying.  Everyone can make<br/>mistakes, including you, right?  A mistake can look like something else if<br/>you want to judge it against your personal criteria.  And isn&apos;t is possible<br/>that you can make a mistake of misinterpretation?  I still see not much<br/>flexibility in the forms of dialog that you find admissable.  We (people) do<br/>not meet each other specifications.  We are alive and have hopes and<br/>limitations, and we need each other&apos;s help and forbearance.  It may be that<br/>you actually wish to help even when you appear harsh, yet please realize<br/>that may be very hard for us to recognize.  As I see it, things you respond<br/>harshly too are often much less harsh in tone than your responses.</p><p>Again, this is just &quot;as I see it&quot;.  That&apos;s my own truth in this, not<br/>perfectly stated, but I hope not too far off the mark, and I&apos;d appreciate<br/>your forbearance in reading it, because no doubt I&apos;ve made some mistakes.</p><p>In Carl&apos;s response he suggested that you might simply share your definition<br/>of &quot;pitch class&quot;.  To simply give a definition (and not be offended by the<br/>request), this is a good way to be more direct.

I<br/>&gt; believe Carl is working harder than anyone at helping to interpret<br/>your work<br/>&gt; on behalf of and for the benfit of the rest of us.  I&apos;m glad for<br/>the dialog<br/>&gt; he is having with you.  Please realize Carl is working at something<br/>here.<br/>&gt; He is not trying to obscure or evade.  Like all of us, he might<br/>even have<br/>&gt; some habits that unknowingly obscure something, but so might you.<br/>If<br/>&gt; something seems to indicate sophistry to you, can look beyond that<br/>&gt; appearance and see Carl&apos;s intention?  He&apos;s trying.  Everyone can<br/>make<br/>&gt; mistakes, including you, right?  A mistake can look like something<br/>else if<br/>&gt; you want to judge it against your personal criteria.  And isn&apos;t is<br/>possible<br/>&gt; that you can make a mistake of misinterpretation?  I still see not<br/>much<br/>&gt; flexibility in the forms of dialog that you find admissable.  We<br/>(people) do<br/>&gt; not meet each other specifications.  We are alive and have hopes and<br/>&gt; limitations, and we need each other&apos;s help and forbearance.  It may<br/>be that<br/>&gt; you actually wish to help even when you appear harsh, yet please<br/>realize<br/>&gt; that may be very hard for us to recognize.  As I see it, things you<br/>respond<br/>&gt; harshly too are often much less harsh in tone than your responses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, this is just &quot;as I see it&quot;.  That&apos;s my own truth in this, not<br/>&gt; perfectly stated, but I hope not too far off the mark, and I&apos;d<br/>appreciate<br/>&gt; your forbearance in reading it, because no doubt I&apos;ve made some<br/>mistakes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Carl&apos;s response he suggested that you might simply share your<br/>definition<br/>&gt; of &quot;pitch class&quot;.  To simply give a definition (and not be offended<br/>by the<br/>&gt; request), this is a good way to be more direct.  Patience is<br/>particularly a<br/>&gt; virtue in teaching, and like it or not, teaching is one thing you<br/>are doing<br/>&gt; here, and I think (please correct me if I&apos;m wrong) in a way you<br/>*do* like<br/>&gt; being a teacher, so why not make the best of it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Kurt</p><p>I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re wrong Kurt.

For example, the &quot;perfect&quot; fifth has a number 7<br/>&gt;(always starting with 0) and wherever that is found throughout the<br/>&gt;range that is the &quot;interval class...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They are certainly not at all synonymous, at least not in the<br/>&gt;contemporary literature, Forte, Perle, etc., etc.</p><p>See my earlier correction.

Why is that, Peter?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I quote myself from above - &quot;Each pitch class comprises an<br/>infinity<br/>&gt; &gt; of pitches&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is that really the entire definition?  Please realize that simple<br/>things can<br/>&gt; be elusive because of their simplicity, particularly when something<br/>more<br/>&gt; complex is suspected.  When communication fails, I often err on the<br/>side of<br/>&gt; expecting something more complex.

Carl has<br/>obviously missed his vocation and should have become a lawyer.</p><p>In any regular division of the octave, there are as many pitch<br/>classes as there are divisions. That should be self-evident, however,<br/>for everyone else&apos;s benefit a simple example should suffice. In 17-DO<br/>there are 17 pitch classes. The octave always belongs to the same<br/>pitch class as the tonic and is therefore not counted as a separate<br/>pitch class, so there are not 18 pitch classes in this example but<br/>17. There is however, a theoretically infinite number of ways of<br/>defining specific proportions for each of those pitch classes, each<br/>definition producing a different numerical value. To take 12-DO as an<br/>example, pitch class 7 may be, among an infinity of other values,<br/>designated by either 2^(7/12) or by 3/2. Each produces a separate<br/>*pitch*, but both pitches belong to the same pitch class, which is 7.</p><p>Peter</p></div>
