Here we have<br/>the precedent of Giovanni Maria Artusi&apos;s allegation that innovative<br/>composer Claudio Monteverdi, whom he attacked in 1600 (citing passages<br/>from some of his later published madrigals without mentioning the<br/>composer&apos;s name) mainly for his unconventional uses of dissonance,<br/>showed in his vocal madrigals an ignorance of the difference in<br/>tunings between voices and fretted instruments such as the lute.[2]</p><p>Artusi was specifically deploring Monteverdi&apos;s use of such intervals<br/>as the diminished fourth or seventh, although earlier composers such<br/>as Wert (held up by Artusi as a model of the good practice being<br/>corrupted by the &quot;moderns&quot; such as Monteverdi) had done the same.</p><p>Artusi suggests that Monteverdi must have tried out such intervals on<br/>an instrument such as the lute, where the use of diminished fourths<br/>and the like is &quot;older than the cuckoo birds,&quot; because the equal<br/>semitones of 12-tET make such intervals equivalent to regular major<br/>thirds, etc. However, by writing such intervals in his vocal pieces,<br/>Monteverdi shows himself uninformed that voices naturally incline to<br/>the pure ratios of just intonation, not the irrational ones used in<br/>fretted instruments.[3]</p><p>In fact, diminished fourths or augmented fifths appear also in the<br/>meantone organ music of earlier 16th-century composers such as Antonio<br/>de Cabezon, where I would certainly not consider them equivalent to<br/>usual major thirds, but rather as &quot;special&quot; (although not too<br/>uncommon) intervals evidently used for their unique color.</p><p>During the Manneristic Era of around 1540-1640, there was a great<br/>fascination with the art of pleasing distortion and the musical<br/>rhetoric of _durezze_ (dissonances or &quot;rough spots,&quot; as one might say<br/>in English) or unusual intervals. Monteverdi&apos;s use both of bold<br/>sevenths and of the diminished fourth or seventh fit in nicely with<br/>this agenda, and may suggest theoretical sophistication rather than<br/>ignorance.</p><p>In other words, Artusi&apos;s allegation of Monteverdi&apos;s &quot;ignorance&quot; may<br/>reflect a less desirable but yet understandable feature of human<br/>nature in many musical disputes of this kind: a tendency not only to<br/>disagree with one&apos;s opponent, but to attribute either incompetence or<br/>outright ignorance to this opponent. The idea of honest and mutually<br/>informed disagreement -- possibly because of differences of taste --<br/>is sadly too rarely recognized in such debates.</p><p>Given Frescobaldi&apos;s very sophisticated musical compositions, and his<br/>familiarity with a wide variety of keyboard instruments as you have<br/>discussed here, I strongly suspect that he was familiar with the<br/>difference in meantone tunings between the two semitones. As Lindley<br/>comments, his supposed ignorance of this distinction was &quot;an unlikely<br/>accusation to make of a former pupil of Luzzaschi,&quot; famed as I recall<br/>you noted in a previous article for his skill on Vicentino&apos;s<br/>archicembalo.</p><p>The question of whether he may have advocated 12-tET as an organ<br/>tuning, however, seems to me quite open, at least unless and until we<br/>find writings in which he expresses his own views of the subject.</p><p>First, I would agree that Frescobaldi&apos;s music typically suggests<br/>meantone, and that Easley Blackwood, for example, his selected one of<br/>his keyboard compositions of an example of the chromaticism possible<br/>within even a conventional 12-note meantone range (e.g. Eb-G# or<br/>Bb-D#).</p><p>However, a composer&apos;s success in writing for the standard intonation<br/>of a given era or style does not necessarily rule out an interest in<br/>more experimental tunings. For example, I can easily imagine a<br/>21st-century composer known for her finesse in 12-tone serialism<br/>taking an interest in 11-tone or 13-tone serialism, and advocating<br/>wider use of these less familiar tunings. Similarly, I would not be<br/>too surprised to discover that in fact Frescobaldi took an interest in<br/>12-tET as a &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot; alternative.</p><p>Rightly or wrongly, this form of equal temperament was widely<br/>associated with Aristoxenos, and thus had something of the romantic<br/>aura of antiquity. Mersenne discussed its possible use on keyboards --<br/>its approximation being difficult on these instruments, in contrast to<br/>the lute where an 18:17 fretting ratio in connection with the physics<br/>of fretting pressure produced a good realization -- and some<br/>contemporaries suggested that it might be less disagreeable if it<br/>became more familiar.</p><p>Why might Frescobaldi, a composer whose keyboard masterpieces seem<br/>nicely to fit the meantone system and exemplify some of its chromatic<br/>possibilities, take an interest in 12-tET?</p><p>Having found Doni&apos;s allegation of Frescobaldi&apos;s ignorance concerning<br/>the two semitones &quot;an unlikely accusation,&quot; he adds[4]:</p><p>          &quot;and yet perhaps a fair indication of Frescobaldi&apos;s<br/>           attitude toward niceties of intonation. Whether his<br/>           magnificent _Cento partite sopra gli passacaglia_<br/>           was intended for equal temperament or for a<br/>           harpsichord with split accidentals for Db/C# as<br/>           well as G#/Ab and D#/Eb, the influence of<br/>           Frescobaldi&apos;s acceptance of equal temperament<br/>           is apparent in the later keyboard music of<br/>           Froberger, who was his pupil in Rome....</p><p>In other words, Lindley seems to suggest indirect evidence for<br/>Frescobaldi&apos;s possibly acceptance of 12-tET: the later musical style<br/>of Froberger. I would myself regard such an argument as interesting<br/>but inconclusive.</p><p>Whatever the merit or persuasiveness of views, Lindley should be noted<br/>for his advocacy of meantone for 16th-17th century music where 12-tET<br/>has often been suggested or presumed: for example, the lute music of<br/>Milan and the Elizabethan keyboard music of a composer such as John<br/>Bull, whose famous hexachord fantasia has a 19-note range. Lindley<br/>regards this piece as likely conceived for an archicembalo.</p><p>In short, while sharing Lindley&apos;s view that Doni&apos;s accusation of<br/>ignorance seems most unlikely, I would consider the possibility that<br/>Frescobaldi favored 12-tET as an organ tuning -- whether as standard<br/>practice, or as an innovative experiment -- as an open but not proven<br/>question.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. &quot;Temperaments,&quot; _New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians_<br/>18:660-674 at 665, ed.
