But I&apos;m now thinking<br/>about the matter of this wonderful thing that we&apos;re interactively discussing<br/>various tuning subjects here, no matter how far in the whole world we are<br/>from each other - something I could hardly imagine when I was a small kid<br/>totally unaware of things like internet. The interesting thing here is that,<br/>as far as I&apos;ve seen so far at least, I&apos;m getting convinced I&apos;m the only one<br/>from the Czech Republic on this list, and I&apos;m even not sure if there is<br/>someone here from, let&apos;s say, Slovakia or Poland or something like this. Who<br/>knows? Maybe I&apos;m wrong. If this is the case, then I&apos;m sending my regards to<br/>these countries.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
