So you could<br/>interpret that as a notation for Augmented.  You can also<br/>say this is what Tripod Notation gives when you allow 5:4<br/>and 9:7 to be tempered the same (36:35 tempered out) along<br/>with the marvel temperament.

That doesn&apos;t work for Magic<br/>because there isn&apos;t a proper MOS between 3 and 19 notes.<br/>The tripod scale is a hack to get a staff notation out of<br/>a 3 note MOS. I don&apos;t see why we should be looking for<br/>Tripod-like solutions where there is an MOS of a reasonable<br/>size.</p><p>Porcupine comes out as 7&amp;15 for me, so it has a juicy 7<br/>note generalized diatonic.  I guess there&apos;s no proper MOS<br/>between 1 and 7 so it won&apos;t divide into feet.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div>
