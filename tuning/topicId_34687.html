I attached them to an email sent<br/>&gt; directly to<br/>&gt;&gt; Paul a few weeks ago. Apparently, he couldn&apos;t get them to play on<br/>&gt; his setup.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i finally got these to work and they&apos;re great! reminds me of the a<br/>&gt; capella groups we had in college (that a lot of my friends were in)<br/>&gt; except that your examples have piano/instrumental accompaniment. lots<br/>&gt; of great-sounding harmonies, gerald -- but i&apos;m not sure if this is<br/>&gt; the best context to look for pitch shifts or adjusted root motions,<br/>&gt; given the prominence of the piano&apos;s cues. in any case, were there any<br/>&gt; specific elements you wanted me to listen for?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; boy do i wish bob wendell were here. bob, where are you? (bob would<br/>&gt; agree with jerry on a lot of things, but not everything)</p><p>Thanks, Paul. I thought you might enjoy these tracks. I&apos;m trying to get<br/>permission from the producers to re-issue the complete &quot;audiophile&quot;<br/>recording as a CD. It was the first of two LA Jazz Choir recordings<br/>nominated for a Grammy.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that singing to a piano accompaniment doesn&apos;t &quot;get in the way&quot;<br/>that much as long as it doesn&apos;t play the same exact thing the choir is<br/>singing. I instruct my pianists to comp only when we&apos;re singing lines and<br/>only play lines while we&apos;re singing chords. The decay of the piano or guitar<br/>sounds minimizes the conflict, I think.</p><p>I agree that this may not be a good source of &quot;research data&quot; but I wanted<br/>to give you a taste of where my ears are coming from. I&apos;m still working on<br/>the CD transfer. If I come on any sustained a cappella chords that sound<br/>&quot;interesting&quot; I&apos;ll zap them to you.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=34689 href="#34689">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2002 11:51:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/21/02 8:13 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 4<br/>&gt;  Date: Fri, 22 Feb 2002 01:59:54 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: gerry&apos;s kids (was: Re: Monz I-IV-V7-I page)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Is it possible to post Jerry&apos;s sound files up on the Web<br/>&gt; someplace??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JP</p><p>My plan is to put sample sounds in a revised &quot;store&quot; on my site.
