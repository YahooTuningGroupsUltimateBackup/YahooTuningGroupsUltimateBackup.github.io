An interesting touch in this<br/>gusheh and Sekaste, for example, is the introduction of Ep, a<br/>neutral third above the final of Mahur, C. This koron step is<br/>used in pieces which may also have low B-natural as the step<br/>below the final, serving to keep a touch of Mahur in its most<br/>familiar form, as Farhat observes.</p><p>The fact that gusheh-ha like Oshshaq can occur in more than<br/>one dastgah makes things intricate, maybe analogously to the<br/>possibility of modulating to a given maqam such as Rast (in<br/>whatever form of intonation one may choose) from various other<br/>maqamat.</p><p>Striving to keep to one point at a time, I&apos;ll reserve comment on<br/>a fascinating historical question the two of you have raised for<br/>another post, but warmly thank you for teaching me about some<br/>corners of the radif previously quite unconsidered by me, and<br/>giving me an occasion to learn more.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
