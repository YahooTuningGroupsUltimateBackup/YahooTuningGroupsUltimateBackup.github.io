Any cell frequency is the product of M, J or U commas by the preceding cell value. To reduce product errors 11 decimal digit cells were used, common fractions had to be set aside. Actually, (9/8)^6 is the cycle that comprises six segments of 9/8 which are coupled geometrically. The octave 2 arises twelve cells before cell N&ordm; 624.</p><p>The progression is able to produce 12 tone scales according to a pair of adders like 50/52, 49/53  provided their sum gives 102. Their values should be about 50.</p><p>When the pair is 49/53, the C# frequency with values comprised within 1 and 2 to be detected in the progression is given by the first number (49), it means that C# frequency corresponds to cell # 49 whose consonant frequency is 1.05707299111. The second adder 53 plus the preceding 49 makes 102 so cell # 102 = 1.12246370821 is D.frequency.</p><p>The first adder 49 works again, it is summed to 102 to give (102 + 49) = 151 so cell # 151 (1.1865234375) is the Eb note frequency.</p><p>Similarly, 151 summed to the second adder 53 gives 204, so cell # 204 = 1.25991918672 is the E tone frequency.</p><p>F tone frequency corresponds to cell # (204 + 49) = Cell # 253 = 1.3318294975 and so forth.</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>As an example, the scale shown below corresponds to pair 51/51. Note that Eb, F# and A tone frequencies of 12 TET and the corresponding cell tones that work in the progression coincide.</p><p>The remaining tone comparisons show very small differences which can be neglected.</p><p>Therefore, a consonant 12 TET cells scale has been drawn from the progression. Should M, J or U values or their sequence are not the ones that work in this set, a useless progression would be the result.</p><p>How this pair (51/51) succeeded in constructing the 12 TET&apos;?. I think it was done by the cell exactness, the correct comma sequence and their values.</p><p>May be the tuning list is not interested on this subject since only a few members requested the progression. The 12 TET cells scale shown below is a reason to investigate on this matter.  By now, there is no explanation on what principles were used by the M, J and U commas to settle such abilities.</p><p>I would be pleased to send you the progression (7 pages) as soon as you request it.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, May 05</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>Pair  51/51...........(A).........(B)</p><p>ADDER ....N0TE --PROGRESSION --12 TET TONE</p><p>....Cell N&ordm; -----------CELL FREQ...FREQ. ......(A)/(B)</p><p>.....# 0...C..1...........1..........1</p><p>51...# 51..C#......1.0594638777.1.0594630943..1.000000739</p><p>51...# 102..D....1.1224637082..1.1224620483...1.000001479</p><p>51...# 153..Eb..1.1892071150.1.1892071150 ...1</p><p>51...# 204..E....1.2599191867..1.2599210498..0.999998521</p><p>51...# 255..F....1.3348388671..1.3348398541..0.999999261</p><p>51...# 306..F#.......1.4142135623..1.4142135623..1</p><p>51...# 357..G....1.4983081847..1.4983070768..1.000000739</p><p>51...# 408..Ab..1.5874033994..1.5874010519..1.000001479</p><p>51...# 459..A....1.6817928305...1.6817928305..1</p><p>51...# 510..Bb..1.7817948013...1.7817974362..0.999998521</p><p>51...# 561..B....1.8877472295...1.8877486253..0.999999261</p><p>51...# 612..2C..2.0000000000...2.0000000000..1</p><p>__________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 5089 (20100505) __________</p><p>ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p><a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p></div>
