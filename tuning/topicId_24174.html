But, the whole thread started as a<br/>&gt;&gt;response to Patrick Ozzard-Low, and now that he&apos;s given up on the<br/>&gt;&gt;idea, it&apos;s kind of moot.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;ve &apos;given up&apos; on the idea of provisional alternative<br/>tuning system standard.</p><p>I hope I&apos;ve been clear that _if_ one could achieve some kind of<br/>practical consensus, say amongst a sigificantly cohesive set of<br/>composers, performers and instrument designers/makers that &apos;tuning<br/>system X&apos; was the one to go for, and committed to it over a period of 5<br/>or 10 years (or more), then I think remarkable results might arise.</p><p>Clearly, there exist loose collections of composers, sometimes together<br/>with performers, often united by an element of geographical proximity<br/>(or the internet), who have done and are doing something similar.  I<br/>guess that around Boston - 72 notes and Ezra Sims, Joe Maneri (and<br/>family), Julia Werntz, and others - are examples.  In France the<br/>microtonal thinking of Pascale Criton and others seems to have been<br/>influenced by the presence in the Paris Conservatoire (no longer there,<br/>I think) of the Carillo 96-divison piano, and a collateral interest in<br/>the tuning &apos;continuum&apos;, and in relationships with electroacoustic media.<br/>We can all probably name other similar alignments or groups.  It&apos;s<br/>difficult to guess, but taken together these groups are possibly out-<br/>numbered by the number of composers (and performers) who seem to remain<br/>content with inflective 1/4-tone writing.</p><p>Few or none of these collectives/groups/whatever have much in the way of<br/>associated and well-developed instrument development projects.<br/>Obviously I&apos;ve put considerable effort into trying to generate interest<br/>in that aspect.  Perhaps the arguments for the advantages of adopting a<br/>provisonal ATS standard are beginning to seep in?  I don&apos;t know.</p><p>But, in addition individual preferences, the fact that these<br/>affiliations and artistic directions are already ingrained, also makes<br/>the likelihood of _trans-collective_ consensus remote.</p><p>BTW-1 - thoughts re adopting _72_ divisions as a standard:</p><p>-  you mention a singer (Judith) with an extremely fine ear - but bear<br/>in mind that although trillions of musicians study ear-training not all<br/>of them develop Boulez&apos;s ear...   No, it&apos;s not a disease.  Identifying<br/>that the bass clarinet played D not Eb in the middle of Gurreleider<br/>isn&apos;t something all musicians are ever going to be able to do.  A<br/>_standard_ will only work if the majority of the relevant musicians are<br/>capable of achieving it.  Alison&apos;s comments on this were very much to<br/>the point, I think.</p><p>- how do you envisage instrument deisgns relating to 72? By creating 24<br/>or 36 division winds? and keyboard/percussion instruments?  (I&apos;m not<br/>against this - I&apos;m just asking!)</p><p>BTW-2 - I thought Daniel Wolf&apos;s suggestions re ear training were rather<br/>good, and not impractical (as I think someone suggested? can&apos;t find all<br/>the comments now).</p><p>Patrick</p><p>--<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low,<br/><a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi</a><br/><a href="http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a><br/><a href="mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=24180 href="#24180">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/1/2001 5:48:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:eGW8TdBte2F7EwfC@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">eGW8TdBte2F7EwfC@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>Patrick wrote:</p><p>&gt; Few or none of these collectives/groups/whatever have much in the way<br/>of<br/>&gt; associated and well-developed instrument development projects.<br/>&gt; Obviously I&apos;ve put considerable effort into trying to generate interest<br/>&gt; in that aspect.

Keyboard and percussion instruments can<br/>be built for the 21 or 31 note subset scales, and still be in tune with<br/>instruments that equally divide the 12-equal steps.  Wind instruments are<br/>something of a black art to me.  But it may be that a subset of the<br/>instrumentarium could play in 31-equal too, or even 10-equal, which would<br/>bring in more composers.</p><p>21st Century theory for 21st Century instruments!</p><p>If you want to reduce typing (and you have been doing a fair bit lately<br/>:) you can call me at (01275) 344 236 daytime and (01275) 340 971<br/>evenings and weekends.

For<br/>12TET he prefers perfect fifths instead of perfect octaves(seventh<br/>root of 1.5)proposing also intermediate tunings;one of them was used<br/>at West Point organ(I don&acute;t know if it is so tuned now). He also<br/>built instruments in several temperaments,approaching just<br/>intonations,incluiding a 53TET lute for which he wrote a study(I<br/>think he never played it,the present recording was made using a<br/>Yamaha SY77).&quot;</p><p>Xavier</p></div><h3><a id=24255 href="#24255">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Ozzard-Low &#x3C;pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 4:17:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;72-tET is nothing more than 12-tET with a just 5:1 and a just 7:1<br/>&gt;&gt;above and below each tone, and an 11th harmonic above each tone (for<br/>&gt;&gt;the quartertones).
