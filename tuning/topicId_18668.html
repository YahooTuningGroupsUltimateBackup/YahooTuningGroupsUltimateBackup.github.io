Can you tell us more about it and what _you<br/>&gt; are doing with it?</p><p>You can see more about it on <a href="http://www.audiosynth.com">www.audiosynth.com</a>. In a nutshell it is (IMHO)<br/>the latest/greatest incarnation of the MusicN (e.g. Csound) languages and<br/>(IMHO) the next step for electro-acoustics. It is written in smalltalk and<br/>is the first program I&apos;ve encountered that successfully combines the three<br/>electro-acoustic schools; concrete, analog synthesis, and computer assisted<br/>composition.</p><p>What makes it remarkable is that it runs in real time on most macs of 333<br/>htz and higher. That is, I have all the power of a programming language<br/>(such as precise calculations, pseudo random walks, chaos, logical<br/>expressions, midi control, virtually unlimited unit generators), but it<br/>feels and acts like the old analog synthesizers.</p><p>When I did my thesis I considered computer assisted microtonal musics, but<br/>my investigation of all available technology discouraged me from continuing.<br/>(I remember looking into MIDI, but abandoned it the minute I found out they<br/>only allowed for 12 keys per octave.) This program is what I wanted back<br/>then. It&apos;s actually easier to do microtones than to do equal tempered stuff!<br/>I&apos;m sure you all agree that EQ is a convolution to adapt a complex<br/>phenomenon to our limited instruments and performing abilities.</p><p>[And I&apos;m a little shy about continuing. I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m out of my league. I<br/>really haven&apos;t studied much of the existing literature. I&apos;m just doing what<br/>interests me. Maybe it&apos;s been tried and discarded? Please inform me.]</p><p>For example, I&apos;ve been toying with free-just intonation. This is the term<br/>Heidi Von Gunden (who worked closely with Johnston) used when I described<br/>what I wanted to do. It doesn&apos;t rely on a set scale or central pitch with<br/>derivations from it. It just tunes all intervals to the lowest ratio and<br/>disregards any drifting, because with the computer that is not an issue. You<br/>are not tied to a set of strings or keys, you don&apos;t ever have to return to a<br/>home base.</p><p>When I first approach an instrument (in this case, the computer) I always<br/>ask, what can it do that I can&apos;t do on anything else. This kind of<br/>precision, accuracy, and breadth seems to be what it can do. It seems<br/>perfect for microtonal ideas.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t work as well with tonal systems, because of the shift in pitch.<br/>(Or are we just not used to such &quot;modulations?&quot; Could we say it is the next<br/>piece, which we have not yet learned to like?) But I&apos;ve done a few things<br/>with wandering intervals. (A random walk through chimes; each chime is a<br/>perfectly tuned interval from the previous. There really isn&apos;t a tonality.)<br/>And it works well with non-tonal structures, such as the 12-tone school.</p><p>I&apos;d be glad to post examples, when they are polished. But I would need to<br/>poll: how many members of this group use Macs? (Or computers, for that<br/>matter?)</p><p>Which brings me to another developing aesthetic: generative music. For the<br/>past two years everything I&apos;ve written is generative (different every time<br/>it&apos;s played). I&apos;m being a little snooty about this idea, insisting that all<br/>of my compositions exist as possibilities, not actual sounds. i.e. there are<br/>no recordings, or written music; just code, and the program that generates<br/>the sounds.</p><p>I look forward to reading your comments/reactions.</p><p>--<br/>&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>David Cottle, computer music, contra, <a href="mailto:cottle@cerlsoundgroup.org">cottle@cerlsoundgroup.org</a></p><p>&quot;Country music is three chords and the truth.&quot; Â‹Harlan Howard</p></div><h3><a id=18700 href="#18700">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2001 5:58:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[David Cottle wrote:]<br/>&gt;[And I&apos;m a little shy about continuing.

(It&apos;s developed by a handful of<br/>individuals who aren&apos;t very interested in making money, mostly just making a<br/>good program. They take on projects that are interesting, and microtonal<br/>capability was proposed by an individual working with it, so the author<br/>spent a lot of time getting it right.)</p><p>It&apos;s not that useful for the style of microtonal stuff I do, but some of you<br/>might find it is just the ticket. A demo (Mac and Windows) is available at:</p><p><a href="http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org">www.cerlsoundgroup.org</a></p><p>It uses pitchbend to playback microtonal notes and chords over MIDI. You<br/>have to make sure each voice is using as many channels are the maximum<br/>number of notes in one chord. It also has user definable symbols and<br/>tunings.</p><p>--<br/>&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>David Cottle, computer music, contra, <a href="mailto:cottle@cerlsoundgroup.org">cottle@cerlsoundgroup.org</a></p><p>&quot;What America needs is 10 years of silence.&quot; Â‹Stravinsky</p></div><h3><a id=69951 href="#69951">ðŸ”—</a>s_donval &#x3C;s_donval@hotmail.fr&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2007 4:18:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mathematician/Physicist and musician</p></div><h3><a id=69963 href="#69963">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2007 10:00:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;s_donval&quot; &lt;s_donval@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mathematician/Physicist and musician</p><p>You might want to take a look at the tuning-math group.
