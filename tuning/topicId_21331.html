But i tend not to be attracted to non- anything. There is usually something i want to have and<br/>have to be quite sure that whatever i build is not boxing me into a corner i can&apos;t get out of. But<br/>having octaves doesn&apos;t prevent me from exploring this area in a way. The Lake Aloe (vibraphone)<br/>solo on From the Interiors of Anaphoria is based on a scale that takes 17 tones of a 22 tone scale<br/>as an octave and then takes 12 tones subsets out of these. Here the tuning is treated as a melodic<br/>scale and not ratio based although they are there. Even in 12 ET you can take 19 units and use 12<br/>tone or 7 tone subsets as your scale. i have done this with various 12 tone tunings. I also like 7<br/>units of a 12 tone scale with taking 5 note subsets.</p><p>&gt; Curious to know how<br/>&gt; they behave for you and the ensembles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank ye,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/20/2001 4:27:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p>&gt;That&apos;s one thing I realy dig about the fragments of Erv&apos;s work I<br/>&gt;have<br/>&gt;grasped - he doesn&apos;t always have to have that old 2/1.</p><p>Wow!

I know he has stated that the Horagrams do not<br/>imply the 2/1 octave. Also the examples of MOS at other intervals besides the 2/1 was shown to me<br/>by him first. I have not seen him use ratio division like Jacky though where he takes a 3/2 of a<br/>stretch octave. But he likes to hide things from people from time to time until he has what he<br/>wants to do with it pretty far down the road. The Lambdomas are another example where the Octave<br/>might be present but not the unifying device. He tends not interested in Non- anything and scales<br/>without octaves he would get to by doing something, not not doing.
