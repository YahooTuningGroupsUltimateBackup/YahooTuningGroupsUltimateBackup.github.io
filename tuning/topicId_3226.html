With Kargiraa (a<br/>Tuvan vocal style that I think I imitate) I start with a comfortable note (about<br/>C# an octave above) and then grunt into a note an octave below - it&apos;s much<br/>&quot;rougher&quot; sounding than the normal bass production of the same pitch.  On a good<br/>day with Kargiraa I can slide it down gradually (meaning slide both apparant fund.<br/>and octave below simultaneously) to about a fourth lower than my lowest normal<br/>bass.  With still another style of bass voice production I relax the throat much<br/>more than with Kargiraa and this is the style that esp. seduces me into thinking<br/>it&apos;s subharmonic because I start with a note, an octave below &quot;kicks in&quot; along<br/>with it, then the fifth below that, two octaves, two octaves and a major third<br/>below, etc. - in other words the bass notes my voice accesses do not come from<br/>gliding but just sort of &quot;pop in&quot; at those fixed intervals - well okay, sometimes<br/>it skips but still conforming to that basic fixed structure in relation to the<br/>original fundamental - and they always come along with the initiated fundamental<br/>(so the original fundamental sounds like a continuous drone throughout this<br/>process of accessing these lower notes - and the lower notes cannot come until the<br/>(orig.) fundamental is established.  In this vocal production I can hear bass<br/>notes that get down about a fourth lower (ex: note an octave and a fifth below a<br/>&quot;low&quot; G that is the initiated fundamental) than my lowest Kargiraa note.  To get a<br/>note two octaves and a major third below a given fundamental (what I call<br/>&quot;subharmonic 5&quot;) I usually must start from a higher note.  Almost always the low<br/>notes in this style of production are quite weak - I&apos;ve yet to find a way to<br/>strengthen them.</p><p>&gt; &gt;(at this point the harmonic overtones tend to be rather weak usually)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by harmonic overtones here?

The F or G near the top of the bass staff is the area where<br/>it&apos;s usually easiest to start the fund. but sometimes from lower notes - this is<br/>really variable depending on the day, my health, etc.</p><p>&gt;As a first</p><p>&gt; step, someone on this list might volunteer to analyse a sample if you can<br/>&gt; provide one (say on your website).

BTW, how limited are<br/>these dinky mics that come with the sound cards (and are there ways to connect<br/>higher quality mics)?</p><p>I am more than ever interested in this discussion of subharmonics and have heard<br/>many good comments.  It seems that even among the researchers I have contacted<br/>(individually that is) there is no agreement.  Some say they definitely exist, and<br/>a acoustics researcher in Sweden said he will send me a copy of his colleague&apos;s<br/>thesis which focuses on vocal subharmonic production.  He mentioned &quot;there is<br/>increased mechanical and possibly aerodynamic coupling between the vocal folds and<br/>the ventricular folds, which causes subperiodic oscillations.&quot;  Comments?</p><p>Anyone know of recent physics/acoustics books that say (and explain how)<br/>subharmonics/undertones can be produced from a fundamental?

I think you&apos;re right that it&apos;s due to period multiplying in<br/>a nonlinear feedback (i.e. chaotic) system.

The discrete simulation was unstable with<br/>delta-t much higher than this. I found some initial values (7.5,0,1) and<br/>then tried different values of c as you suggested.</p><p>The spectra, when they are strongly periodic, look very-roughly symmetrical<br/>about the fundamental, e.g. for period 5 we get moderate amounts of 4/5 and<br/>6/5 and weaker 3/5 and 7/5 and hardly any 2/5 and 8/5 and essentially no<br/>1/5 or 9/5.
