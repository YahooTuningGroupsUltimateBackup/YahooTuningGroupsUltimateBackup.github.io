The same numerical ratios which exist<br/>between the seven tones of the diatonic scale, were thought to be<br/>found again in the distances of the celestial bodies from the central<br/>fire. Hence the harmony of the spheres, which was heard by Phythagoras<br/>alone among mortal men, as his disciples asserted. The numerical<br/>speculation of the Chinese in primitive times reach as far. In the<br/>book of Tso-kiu-ming, a friend of Confucius (B.C. 500), the five tones<br/>of the old Chinese scale were compared with the five elements of their<br/>natural philosophy--water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The whole<br/>numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 were described as the source of all perfection.<br/>At a later time the 12 Semitones of the Octave were connected with the<br/>12 months in the year, and so on. Similar references of musical tones<br/>to the elements, the temperaments, and the constellations are found<br/>abundantly scattered among the musical writings of the Arabs. The<br/>harmony of the spheres plays a great part throughout the middle ages.<br/>According to Athanasius Kircher, not only the macrocosm, but the<br/>microcosm is musical. Even Keppler, a man of deepest scientific<br/>spirit, could not keep himself free from imaginations of this kind.<br/>Nay, even in the most recent times, theorizing friends of music may be<br/>found who will rather feast on arithmetical mysticism than endeavor to<br/>hear upper partial tones.&quot; (Hermann Helmholtz, &quot;On the Sensations of<br/>Tone&quot; p. 229)</p><p>So while Helmholtz was an ardent proponent of just intonation, he was<br/>also a great &quot;age of reason&quot; scientist, and he can barely subdue his<br/>own biases here; the sting in &quot;imaginations of this kind&quot; is<br/>unmistakable! Interestingly enough, I also remember Carl Sagan using<br/>the same example of Keppler to make similarly stinging points about<br/>&quot;the Pythagorean doctrine&quot;...</p><p>I don&apos;t share Helmholtz&apos; view. All sorts of &quot;imaginations of this<br/>kind&quot; make up some of the most important things in my life... so to my<br/>mind he&apos;s selling &quot;imaginations of this kind&quot; much too short. However,<br/>I must also admit that I find a lot of the contemporary &quot;imaginations<br/>of this kind&quot; to be almost diametrically opposed to so many of my own<br/>personal experiences and feelings - see &quot;What Do Pure Intervals Sound<br/>Like?&quot; of Kyle Gann&apos;s &quot;Just Intonation Explained&quot; for a good example<br/>of what I&apos;m trying to get at here.</p><p>Carl E. Seashore wrote of esthetics as a normative science, and he<br/>gave a voice to the fundamental role of &quot;imaginations of this kind&quot;<br/>that I would personally find much more palatable and resonant.</p><p>&quot;The musical medium is the music proper as executed in the form of<br/>physical sounds which have their physiological and mental correlates.<br/>Esthetics accepts the scientific approach to the medium as physical,<br/>psychophysical, physiological, and psychological. Instead of assuming<br/>that millions of phenomena of musical sounds are ethereal and<br/>unclassifiable, not reducible to law and order, it begins at once to<br/>put order into chaos by setting questions to nature under control. It<br/>proceeds on the assumption that these phenomena are knowable if we<br/>have the patience and skill to search for them; it discredits the<br/>armchair procedure of merely thinking and talking about them; it<br/>distrust traditions, vogues, hobbies, and mystical and theological<br/>hunches. Instead of beginning with the pinnacle, it starts from the<br/>ground, building its<br/>structure patiently, block by block, even realizing that the structure<br/>will never be completed. It will never give us the dreamed-of theory<br/>of beauty but will progressively enrich our insights into the nature<br/>and structure of beauty with the growing appreciation of the infinite<br/>richness of possibilities.</p><p>It begins with the classification of the physical characteristics of<br/>the sound wave and carries this classification through the physical<br/>sounds, as mediated through the physiological organism, as responded<br/>to by the psychological organism in sensory experience, and as<br/>reproduced and elaborated in memory, imagination, thought, and<br/>emotional drives in their marvelous possibilities of intricate<br/>relationships.</p><p>But let us not delude ourselves into thinking that the situation is<br/>simple or solved. If there where a one-to-one relationship between the<br/>physical sound and the mental experience or response which it<br/>illicits, our problem would be simplified. However, these<br/>relationships scarcely if ever exist. The mental process never<br/>corresponds exactly to the physical event, and it is in this situation<br/>that the real problem of the psychologist begins on the task of<br/>discovering law and order in the deviations of the mental event from<br/>the physical event. This leads us first to the staggering realization<br/>that in musical art, &quot;All is illusion.&quot; Without the blessing of normal<br/>illusions, musical art would be hopelessly stunted. Our profoundest<br/>appreciation&apos;s of nature and art are detachments from the physically<br/>exact and constitute a synthesis through the medium of normal<br/>illusions. But the composer, the performer, and the listener all deal<br/>with the physical medium and all the theories of form and<br/>interpretation of message and response must in the long run be<br/>grounded upon a true cognizance of the nature of this medium and its<br/>possible roles.&quot; (Carl E. Seashore, &quot;Psychology of Music&quot; pp. 377-78)</p><p>I&apos;ve brought this quote up before, but I still find it to be relevant,<br/>grounded and &apos;fair.&apos; However, should others not have this reaction, I<br/>can understand that as well. But in the context of this topic I<br/>thought it would be a good opportunity to run it out again... For when<br/>Seashore writes, &quot;our profoundest appreciation&apos;s of nature and art are<br/>detachments from the physically exact,&quot; I&apos;m reminded of the great<br/>promoter and champion of wilderness Sigurd Olson who wrote, &quot;no longer<br/>can wilderness be saved from the standpoint of physical enjoyment but<br/>only as a stepping stone to cosmic understanding,&quot; and, &quot;in a world<br/>confused and strident, a world where all the old verities are being<br/>questioned, this is the final answer.&quot; And I&apos;ve always thought that<br/>Olson was expressing ideals from a mindset that was remarkably<br/>analogous to Charles Ives&apos; anagogic vision of music&apos;s -- and indeed<br/>humanity&apos;s -- great potential... and I guess I just can&apos;t see the<br/>great gist of &quot;music&quot; in this light as something too overly bound to<br/>any one of its particulars.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
