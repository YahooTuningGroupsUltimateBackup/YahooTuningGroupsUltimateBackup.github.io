Also for the melodyned choir.<br/>I like it a lot, and also in the re-tuned version better than the original<br/>performance.<br/>Btw it now has 4 wolfs in it, more than ever haha :)<br/>I&apos;m going to write out the tuning now and post it later.<br/>Still it sound right to me, and my harmonic permutation theory sais it has<br/>to be so. It actually resembles my choir piece a little I realised, it<br/>modulates a lot unlike the drei equale.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=85932 href="#85932">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2010 5:15:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Uploaded the transcription to my site.<br/>Also uploaded an old adaptive-ji version for comparison.

If you look at the transcription you&apos;ll<br/>see how it works musically.<br/>I see it as that 9/8 4/3 5/3 is an in tune chord etc. And as proof that all<br/>music is in it&apos;s basis indeed JI.<br/>Should I ever come back from this tuning I may aswell quit tuning<br/>alltogether, I see it as that fundamentally right.<br/>If this is wrong then all is wrong :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also for the melodyned choir.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds fine.

I have to say, the tonal-JI version is very much in tune, really good work there.

Punch due to tuning or due to<br/>soundquality difference?<br/>I&apos;m guessing you mean tuning? Right before the chord you mention there&apos;s a<br/>particulary much out of tune (way too high) voice in the original, which<br/>indeed affects how the next chord is perceived.<br/>I&apos;m not sure which one I like best myself btw, the original or retuned one.<br/>A choir with all it&apos;s quirks has a feel to it that&apos;s alive, I don&apos;t much<br/>mind the tuning beeing a bit off.<br/>And in my retuned version there&apos;s not much perfection anyhow as all the<br/>voices bend and vibrate all over the place.<br/>Now the Beethoven piece for trombones, that&apos;s going to be a whole different<br/>story. It&apos;s where tuning will shine :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thankfully the music was not originally written for saw wave. The tonal-JI<br/>&gt; version played with saws is piercing and static, where the 12-tet version<br/>&gt; has a fuzzy, fat sound which is soothing and easy to listen to.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t much like 12tet fuzziness myself. But one could achieve the same<br/>effect by slightly detuning 2 oscillators to soften the saw, yet still be in<br/>JI tuning with every note.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though my ears aren&apos;t as finely-tuned as yours I&apos;m sure, that is the<br/>&gt; opinion of this microtonalist.<br/>&gt;<br/>Ohh I dunno.. If I can call my ears fine tuned.<br/>I make mistakes all the time, and it takes me a long time sometimes to hear<br/>something is wrong.<br/>Most of what I do is by theory, could not do it all by ear.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s interesting - I played a chord progression in 13-limit JI and then a<br/>&gt; 12-tet version to one non-musician friend of mine.

I prefer the trombone midi sound<br/>myself, sound nr 58 or 57 (depending on where your midi file writer starts<br/>to count on 0 or 1)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately he thought I was playing the same thing to him over and over<br/>&gt; again. While he probably has bad ears, I wonder how many of the non-musician<br/>&gt; public would feel the same way as him. This seems to me to be a big obstacle<br/>&gt; to having a framework for perfectly in-tune music (such as tonal-JI) become<br/>&gt; recognised and being used by more than just us tuning fanatics.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oef he must have bad ears indeed!<br/>But I belief that should JI become practical to use correctly and produce<br/>quality music with it (perhaps even by retuning music with melodyne), that<br/>real music lovers will hear the difference, and increase in emotional<br/>content.<br/>If enough music lovers and music makers hear the advantage there could be a<br/>buzz, and it is these people who would bring it to the bigger public.<br/>I know this sounds like a fantasy that&apos;ll never happen to most, but I think<br/>it&apos;s possible, in the near future even.</p><p>&gt; Looking forward to hearing the Drei Equale submissions. All the best!<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes me too!<br/>So far 2 submission in, and 2 in the making that I&apos;m aware of. Though<br/>probably more people are secretly working on a version too :)<br/>21 March is closing date for submissions. Voting will probably start around<br/>April 1st.<br/>I plan to render all submissions with both an electronic sound, and retune a<br/>real trombone quartet recording for each tuning.<br/>Should be great listening pleasure :)</p><p>All the best to you too!</p><p>Marcel</p></div>
