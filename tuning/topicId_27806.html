Also has a brief visit to the Ab at<br/>8/5 on the way back to C the second time.</p><p>There is no way an adaptive retuning program could tell which it was<br/>until one gets to the resolution.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>Idea was as an example of a tune where the real time<br/>adaptive tuning program would have to look several<br/>bars ahead to decide how to tune a note.</p><p>As it turned out, it has some melodic diesis shifts too at the end<br/>(a la Margo Schulter / Vincentino),<br/>which makes it something of an impossible to solve adaptive<br/>puzzle at that point, at least for conventional twelve note<br/>adaptive tuning.</p><p>Of course, this is just part of the puzzle. To make<br/>a really puzzling tune for an adaptive tuning program,<br/>one would need to go round it several times.</p><p>This isn&apos;t a comma pump proper, because it can be retuned<br/>perfectly with no overall shifts of pitch, but if you<br/>make the wrong decision for the unexpected note, then<br/>it turns into a comma pump.</p><p>So the adaptive tunign challenge is to find the optimal<br/>solution that has no overall shift of pitch (and no<br/>fudging of the pitches), which a real-time adaptive<br/>tuning program couldn&apos;t possibly do.</p><p>A leisure time one could do in principle, but might find it<br/>a bit of a puzzle too.

Is the point to give a<br/>&gt; player real-time control of which 12 pitch classes the 12 keys<br/>&gt; represent?</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s right.</p><p>The note in the root control channel changes the root for the notes<br/>in the playing channels. So for ex, if the root control channel<br/>note is 5/4, then for the 12-tone j.i. scale cross set,</p><p>1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>with C of keyboard playing 1/1</p><p>it gets transposed up by 5/4 to</p><p>5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 225/128 15/8 2/1 25/12 9/4 75/32</p><p>with E of keyboard playing the 5/4,<br/>so that starting from C the scale now is:</p><p>1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 225/128 15/8 2/1</p><p>So now you can play a just diatonic E, and an E major chord with<br/>5/4 25/16 15/8<br/>instead of the<br/>5/4 8/5 15/8 of the j.i. scale.</p><p>E minor is okay in both scales. But try a trickier one, say, D</p><p>then in the C root j.i., the D minor is 9/8 4/3 5/3<br/>i.e. 1/1 32/27, 40/27, which is a real WOLF.</p><p>Touch the D root control and you can now play the pure<br/>just D minor and D major in the scale:</p><p>81/80 135/132 9/8 6/5 81/64 27/20 45/32 3/2 405/256 27/16 9/5 15/8 81/40<br/>e.g. D minor as<br/>9/8 27/20 27/16</p><p>With FTS as set up at present, you can either assign an octave of<br/>your keyboard to root control keys, or use a separate channel<br/>for root control.</p><p>For the score I used a separate channel. Also if one has a second<br/>manual, or organ type pedals, one can use those for root control<br/>in the same way.</p><p>(I may later combine the two methods, so that<br/>one can have one channel for all the root controls, or<br/>factor selections, and the rest free for playing).</p><p>Though one can use the method to just remap twelve tone<br/>note names to new pitches (in either octave or non octave<br/>scale), one can also more generally use any mapping of the<br/>128 midi notes to scale pitches.</p><p>One of the presets is the harmonic series tonality diamond<br/>assigned to successive white keys of the keyboard.</p><p>One can also select a scale / mode into any of the midi<br/>channels, which doesn&apos;t have to be the same scale as is<br/>used for root control (allowing, e.g., tonality diamonds)<br/>and in fact, one can select a different scale / mode<br/>into each channel too if one wants.</p><p>So for example, this lets one use Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>mappings of two keyboards to play a scale, plus<br/>a diesis shift of the scale, or more generally,<br/>to play any scale of 24 or less notes in an octave.</p><p>(Now I _have_ to get my second keyboard to try this<br/>out!)</p><p>One can also have, say, up to 15 scales, or modes of a<br/>scale, and sweep through them while playing by assigning<br/>a controller to change the &quot;voice channel&quot; while playing<br/>- or can achieve same effect if one has an easy way<br/>to quickly change midi in channels while playing.</p><p>There&apos;s also a cross free option that allows one<br/>to continually change in a free fashion - e.g.<br/>play a melody line, and when it hits on A,<br/>touch the A root control and you get A root j.i.<br/>starting from that very note, without any<br/>diesis shifts.</p><p>Then when it reaches D, touch the D and you are<br/>off into D major rooted j.i., again with no<br/>diesis shift, but of course, one gets<br/>diesis / comma drift instead.</p><p>This section is very new, has bugs for sure, and I<br/>may not have explained it very well yet, but will be<br/>working on it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=27867 href="#27867">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2001 9:43:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert, I uploaded the tuned version of your sequence yesterday, to the<br/>JdL directory of the files area.

I can run your piece with vertical springs at 2^16 of nominal,<br/>&gt;&gt;but I don&apos;t think there&apos;d be much vertical improvement.  I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;currently have, but could add, detection and reporting of places where<br/>&gt;&gt;an &quot;impossible&quot; mixture of notes takes place; it is quite common in<br/>&gt;&gt;practice.</p><p>[Robert:]<br/>&gt;Okay, I understand that.</p><p>It&apos;s actually worse because I&apos;m using the equal3 tuning file, which I<br/>prepared at your suggestion, in which tritones conflict with a stack of<br/>minor thirds, and even major seconds add stress against a fourth minus<br/>a minor third.  So all the vertical deviation and pain numbers are<br/>inflated.  Taking Paul E&apos;s suggestion, tritones and seconds get zero<br/>vertical strength, which improves the calculated vertical pain<br/>considerably (without _necessarily_ improving the resultant tuning).</p><p>&gt;Perhaps it&apos;s a little tricky sometimes comparing two tunings to see<br/>&gt;which is best, as one can listen to particularly nice intervals in one<br/>&gt;tuning, and then look out for the same ones in another, and doing that<br/>&gt;is likely to favour whichever is the one that one listens to first.</p><p>I know what you&apos;re saying; my ear is frustratingly inconsistent in its<br/>reaction to a given tuning.

I went back and reread your previous reply and realized you<br/>&gt;&gt;had stated that before as well.  This system makes a lot of sense,<br/>&gt;&gt;especially for sequences with just one or two voices.

Thus, any GM<br/>module can play the fully sequence without understanding the control<br/>messages.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Right!  That dang channel, in the middle of the GM list; it&apos;d be nice<br/>&gt;&gt;to have an actual use for it.
