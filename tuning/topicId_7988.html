The important thing to remember is the playing is primarily<br/>melodic.  Even in the left hand, chords can be played with only one button.<br/> Reaching chords and weaving lines fugue-like is less of an issue as it is<br/>with keyboards.  Although I have a recording of my grandfather playing some<br/>wild stuff on his Bandoneon (which, depending on who you ask, is either a<br/>type of concertina or a type of &apos;button box&apos;). . .  The only comparison of<br/>some of the different systems I&apos;m aware of is at Hans Palm&apos;s Accordion page...</p><p><a href="http://accordion.simplenet.com/index.html">http://accordion.simplenet.com/index.html</a></p><p>...and I find it telling that he picks the Janko as best.</p><p>&gt;The Starr generalized keyboard represents a number of compromises on Erv<br/>&gt;Wilson&apos;s part.

It will be one of the most powerful<br/>keyboard instruments in the World!  And as I said, the honeycomb thing does<br/>make things more compact, and may actually be conducive to some types of<br/>scale-based playing, which Erv seems to have great interest in (I asked him<br/>about some unreachable chords, and he said he didn&apos;t want to play them!).</p><p>&gt;The Hackleman-Wilson clavichord keyboard really benefits from the tactile<br/>&gt;qualities of the mixed hardwood keys and the clavichord ranks are more<br/>&gt;steeply elevated than are those on the Starr keyboard.

But cross-rank fingering is only a problem on the<br/>elevated version because of the hexagonal keys.  The Janko/Bosanquet setup<br/>has the best of both worlds in this respect.</p><p>Two other things I don&apos;t like about the MicroZone are...</p><p>1. The keys are too small!<br/>2.
