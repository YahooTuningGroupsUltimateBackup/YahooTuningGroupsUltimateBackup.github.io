My ongoing pet project<br/>&gt; is the occurance of JI or natural scale harmonies found in traditional folk<br/>&gt; musics of the world. My particular emphasis and expertise of study is in<br/>&gt; Appalachian and Celtic fiddle music, country/piedmont/delta acoustic guitar<br/>&gt; blues, and eastern European klezmer music, I also have significant interests<br/>&gt; (or obsessions) in French and Hungarian hurdy gurdy, Swedish nyckelharpa,<br/>&gt; fiddle and overtone flute styles, and eastern European and gypsy uses of<br/>&gt; overtone flutes, harmonic singing and jaw harps... The FAQ on this subject<br/>&gt; could easily draw on uses of JI in many other folk/world styles. Obvious<br/>&gt; examples include didjeridu (yidaki), gamelan, mbira and kora music...<br/>&gt; Perhaps folks with expertise in different areas would wish to contribute as<br/>&gt; well.</p><p>&gt; This could take me a couple of weeks to put together, with everything else<br/>&gt; that is going on these days, but I&apos;d love to do it, if there is anyone out<br/>&gt; there interested in reading about this subject besides myself.</p></div>
