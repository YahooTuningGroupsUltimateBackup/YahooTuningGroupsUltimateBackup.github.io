I<br/>think it is reasonable to allow a slightly larger fudge (half a comma<br/>or so) for the minor third, since that is not pure even in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone.</p><p>All the major thirds from Bb-D round A-C# are then compatible with a<br/>pure third from the solo instrument. All minor thirds from G-Bb round<br/>to C#-E also satisfy the relevant criterion.</p><p>However C-Eb, F-Ab, Bb-Db, Eb-Gb, Ab-Cb are Pythagorean minor thirds<br/>or worse. Of these, Quantz happened to mention C-Eb, Bb-Db and Ab-Cb,<br/>which span the set of five, perhaps because these three lie the<br/>highest on the harpsichord inside the normal range of continuo chords.</p><p>Considering the major thirds again, all of them from E-G# round to<br/>Eb-G are worse than 12-ET, some indeed beyond Pythagorean. Of these,<br/>Quantz made examples of E-G#, B-D#, F#-A#, and C#-E#.</p><p>However, this is only by way of counterexample. I don&apos;t really believe<br/>it can be justified to make this kind of pipe-dream deduction from a<br/>clearly incomplete and inexact (though perfectly clear as to general<br/>principles) text, a text which was never even about how to tune a<br/>keyboard.</p><p>Actually, any modified meantone in which *most* of the seven thirds<br/>Quantz specifically mentioned are obviously impure, and probably some<br/>others too, but in contrast the diatonic and &apos;central&apos; thirds such as<br/>Bb-D or D-F# are not obviously impure, is consistent with the text<br/>making sense.<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=74459 href="#74459">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2007 9:39:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since Brad thinks that it&apos;s impossible to have a modified meantone<br/>&gt; more unequal than 1/6-comma in which Quantz&apos; remarks can be literally<br/>&gt; true, here&apos;s one simple counterexample.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C 0<br/>&gt; G 697<br/>&gt; D 194<br/>&gt; A 891<br/>&gt; E 388<br/>&gt; B 1085<br/>&gt; F# 582<br/>&gt; C#  84<br/>&gt; G# 790 or 791<br/>&gt; Eb 294<br/>&gt; Bb 1001<br/>&gt; F 503<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, as in fact described in Marpurg&apos;s Principes du Clavecin, seven<br/>&gt; fifths from F round to F# are made flat, the remaining ones wider or<br/>&gt; at least more pure.
