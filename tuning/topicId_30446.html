This remarkable ruler was called Stupor Mundi, or &quot;The Wonder of<br/>the World,&quot; by his contemporaries. Frederick was a German by descent and<br/>master of most of the German world, though his domains included his<br/>native Sicily-where, in the 13th century, Greek was still spoken-and<br/>there was a significant Muslim population. Frederick spoke six languages<br/>fluently, among them Greek and Arabic. An ardent scholar of the<br/>philosophy and the sciences, he had read the Koran and was an early<br/>biologist. He got on well with Muslim rulers, whom he considered his<br/>only cultural equals, and he kept a harem.&quot;  Later: &quot;He also had led a<br/>crusade after being excommunicated and won his object, the return of<br/>Jerusalem, by negotiation rather than through bloodshed.&quot; Sounds like in<br/>this man, Europe and Arabia were quite intertwined.<br/>And, of course, with the numerous crusades, there was certainly a lot of<br/>mingling between Europe and the Middle East. This sounds like a real<br/>interesting field for investigation, as far as music and tuning goes.<br/>Someone just mentioned the music group Hesperion; they are doing some<br/>interesting things with their take on early Jewish music, and the mixing<br/>of European and Arabic elements.

I don&apos;t know much about Persian<br/>music or tuning, however, so can&apos;t really comment further on that.</p><p>During the 1100-1500s, there certainly was a great deal of trade<br/>between Western Europe -- especially Flanders (Brugge) and then the<br/>Republic of Venice -- and the area we now call the Middle East.<br/>And as far back as the late 700s, Charlemagne had close diplomatic<br/>ties with the Baghdad Caliphate.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
