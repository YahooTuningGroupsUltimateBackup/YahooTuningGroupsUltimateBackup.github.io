Then you simply dance around inside<br/>&gt; &gt; the lattice to create your music.  The closer your hands (or<br/>&gt; &gt; feet) come to any individual lattice-point, the louder it<br/>&gt; &gt; becomes.

I had the simple idea of making a ratio<br/>&gt; sound when its lattice-point was touched.  Denny Genovese<br/>&gt; suggested having the volume of the pitch reflect the distance<br/>&gt; of the hand away from the lattice-point, an idea which reflected<br/>&gt; his deep interest in the Theremin at the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason I posted this to the list when I did was explain<br/>&gt; at the beginning of my post: it was my response to some fantasies<br/>&gt; that had been posted about new types of flexibly-tuned pianos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But maybe I&apos;d had a hunch that you&apos;d respond...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>Perhaps it has already been mentioned, but some folks at the<br/>MIT media lab have demonstrated a contraption that could do<br/>this trick.  They have been working on gestural controllers<br/>for many years, and I saw Teller (?) of Penn and Teller<br/>demonstrate a unit where he triggered sonic events just by<br/>his motions inside a sensor equipped cage.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
