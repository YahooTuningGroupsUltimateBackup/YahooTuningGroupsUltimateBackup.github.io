I&apos;m an afficionado of the baroque, so perhaps beginning with<br/>Telemann&apos;s Trio Sonata in Bflat as listed by Michael J. Starke on MidiWorld.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1. I can play this piece, but can I download it in a useful way.</p><p>2. Having downloaded it, can I deconstruct it. That is, dissemble the<br/>musical lines, remove the instrumental harmonics, &amp;c. and then stretch it to<br/>my recipe.</p><p>3. Is there software that will do all of this rather transparently.</p><p>What I know:</p><p>I am reasonably computer savvy to the point that I can hack simple code if<br/>it is in a recognizeable language, and being a geophysicist I know all about<br/>waves. I also know enough about instruments to understand that simple<br/>harmonic theory is not the law that they understand.</p><p>What I don&apos;t know:</p><p>Anything about &quot;just&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;, although I marvel at those that do.</p><p>For the moment</p><p>Cheers</p><p>fidopythy</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2003 2:28:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, francis muir &lt;francis@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For starters what I want to do is to examine Equal Temperament<br/>based on the<br/>&gt; Perfect Fifth and be able to compare it with conventional ET based<br/>on the<br/>&gt; octave.

Personally,<br/>I&apos;d recommend flattening it by that amount instead, but you can easily<br/>make retuned midi files with these tunings.</p></div>
