If<br/>experimental/theoretical work does not have a final stage of &quot;music<br/>making&quot;, it is mostly meaningless.<br/>Mostly you can detect this kind of half baked approach, by the<br/>complete lack of discussion of the tuning in a real musical context;<br/>and usually hand in hand there is no discussion of the intended<br/>timbres or styles.

Hi<br/>Joe!</p><p>My thoughts were more that he was thinking in the concrete 1/6 comma<br/>meantone system or Werckmeister system that Ed Foote was talking<br/>about.  That, is, provided he could still HEAR the system which,<br/>apparently he could... in the period we were discussing.</p><p>After that time, most probably, he wrote with these same sounds in<br/>mind...

Was that<br/>a Ken Russell film???</p><p>_________ _______ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
