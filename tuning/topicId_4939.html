An interesting experiment:<br/>listen to a sustained sine tone in the 100-500 hz range for 30 seconds at a<br/>mezzo-forte volume and see if you can remember what the not&apos;s supposed to<br/>be, or, does it appear to be just this all-encompassing sound object?<br/>As you increase the volume what happens to the perceived pitch? For me, at<br/>freqs around 100 hz or so the pitch seems to rise a good minor 3rd before I<br/>perceive the sound as _very loud. (That&apos;s sumpthn for one with &quot;perfect<br/>pitch&quot; to have to admit.)<br/>As to reproducing sine waves: that&apos;s one of those things Nature abhors, like<br/>a vacuum. Things just don&apos;t like to vibrate linearily if they can help it,<br/>so the more stages the sine has to negotiate, including our ears, the more<br/>stuff&apos;s added.<br/>Then, on t&apos;other hand (or ear, maybe) a scope can register a surprising<br/>amount of visual distortion of a sine wave before the ear cares much, or at<br/>least, before mine do. And if you disagree, you simply have different ears.<br/>Other musician friends of mine can pick out electronic distortion long<br/>before I, and yet I can hear the same range of frequencies.<br/>So who knows, actually polyphonic music done in sine waves could have some<br/>unexpected results. Keep it up<br/>Jay</p></div><h3>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>9/19/1999 5:11:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 9/19/99 9:02:18 PM, Jay Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:jaywill@utah-inter.net">jaywill@utah-inter.net</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;Especially with sine waves, loudness has a terrific impact on your<br/>&gt;perception of pitch and how much it&apos;s changed.</p><p>yes, loud sound/noise can create audio illusions (listen to<br/>music by Mayanne Amacher or Merzbow to experience<br/>effects of loudness, pitch, difference tonality &amp; audiotory<br/>overload).</p><p>also check out the audiotory illusions at:<br/><a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/highest_note/ex.about.fr.html">http://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/highest_note/ex.about.fr.html</a></p><p>zHANg</p></div>
