Those few of you who have the LP recording of Partch&apos;s &quot;Oedipus&quot; should remember his name from the jacket notes.  He is now 73 and said that many of those in the Gate 5 ensemble were from the nearby Presidio Army band.  Thus there should be some other survivors from that time, some fifty years ago.</p></div><h3><a id=28801 href="#28801">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 2:00:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>First off, thanks for the news of the Centennial at MSU. While I&apos;ve<br/>had news of it at Corporeal Meadows for a couple of months, and it<br/>went out on our mailing list, I didn&apos;t specifically mention it on<br/>this list.</p><p>A couple of people asked that I just send our every-so-often news<br/>updates to individuals rather than the list, as to avoid duplication.<br/>However, it pains me to know that the hall wasn&apos;t overflowing,<br/>especially for such a unique concert (Petals). They sold out the hall<br/>in San Francisco (as well they should), and I&apos;ll have to do more to<br/>publicize stuff on the other end of the country, I guess...</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John F. Sprague&quot; &lt;jsprague@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; One of those in attendance was Gerd Stern.</p><p>Did you meet him, and would you know how to contact him? If not, I&apos;ll<br/>just write Dean and see if he can. The reason? (read on)</p><p>&gt; Thus there should be some other survivors from that time, some<br/>&gt; fifty years ago.</p><p>Yes. The Centennial-Extension program we were planning for San Jose<br/>State had to be cancelled (Sept. 22) due to travel difficulties.<br/>However, it is currently planned for Feb. 2, 2002, and will include<br/>people from the Bay area that knew and worked with Partch in the very<br/>late 40&apos;s and early 50&apos;s, and maybe some from the Petaluma days in<br/>the early 60&apos;s. We are hoping Bob Gilmore will return to present,<br/>Philip Blackburn will be doing a presentation, Lou Harrison is set to<br/>do a talk, and once again John Schneider and &quot;Just Strings&quot; will do<br/>their concert/theater program of early Partch works (1929-1941).<br/>Along with the photo exhibition &quot;I Was A Bum Once Myself&quot;, it should<br/>be a fine day of Partch near his old stomping grounds.</p><p>This time I&apos;ll personally keep the tuning community &apos;in the loop&apos;.</p><p>Thanks again, and write me off-list if you have contact with Gerd<br/>Stern...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=28817 href="#28817">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 3:23:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: Jon Szanto &lt;<a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; However, it pains me to know that the hall wasn&apos;t overflowing,<br/>&gt; especially for such a unique concert (Petals).

And<br/>also New Yorkers who can&apos;t be bothered to come<br/>out to NJ. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any train service to Montclair<br/>on the weekends.</p><p>I was at the concert yesterday. Positively amazing.<br/>Bravo. A virtuoso performance. They performed<br/>San Francisco and Barstow. Then Pedals followed by<br/>an instrument demonstration and a repeat of verses 24-24<br/>where earlier verses are superimposed on each other.<br/>Most of the performers conducted or at least counted off sections,<br/>wearing headphones during the later sections to hear a click track.</p><p>It was an experience to walk into the hall and see all the instruments on<br/>stage. 6 harmonic cannons, 2 kithara, 2 surrogate kithara, cloud chamber<br/>bowls,<br/>2 chromelodeons, koto and so on. The stage was mighty crowded. :)</p><p>I hope there&apos;s more performances of Pedals in the future,<br/>I can&apos;t imagine that Newband would learn this only to perform<br/>it once.</p><p>*</p><p>BTW: 17 Lyrics of Li Po is being performed on<br/>10/6/2001 at Tonic, but I doubt I&apos;ll be able to attend.</p><p><a href="http://www.tonic107.com/">http://www.tonic107.com/</a></p><p>Harry Partch: 17 Lyrics of Li Po<br/>at 8:00pm, $10 Tzadik Festival<br/>The Seventeen Lyrics of Li Po was composed by the legendary Harry Partch<br/>between 1931 and 1933.
