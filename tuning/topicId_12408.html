Each sound can be tuned anywhere from -2400 to<br/>+2400 cents in 1 cent steps.  This is possible on a per pad, per pad<br/>set (or patch) basis.  Where I had gone wrong before was trying to<br/>adjust the pitch in &quot;quick edit&quot; mode.  Full edit mode gives you the<br/>necessary fine resolution.

How does it feel<br/>under you fingers? Is it limited to only 15 sounds in a &quot;patch&quot; - or<br/>can you use velocity crossfading to have more? Is it easy when you<br/>are playing a number of different sounds in a patch to keep your<br/>fingers from causing vibrational crosstalk between the different<br/>areas of the head? I&apos;m also a hand drummer; I play Tar, Bodhran and<br/>Riq - but I have used my fair share of midi percussion controllers<br/>too. One piece I&apos;ve used quite a bit is the Roland SPD Pad, which has<br/>8 small pads - and with a pedal, you can alternate between two layers<br/>of 8 sounds for 16 total per patch. You can also use a second switch<br/>to toggle through a number of patches - for playing full midi range<br/>scales. Do you know if there are similar ways to get a more full<br/>range out of the Handsonic? Also, does it allow you to record it&apos;s<br/>midi out into a sequencer, then play it back into the Handsonic as a<br/>midi module would? It is great that they gave such a wide range for<br/>the tuning. Hey - if you put together some mp3s with this, please let<br/>us know - I&apos;d personally be interested to hear what you&apos;ve came up<br/>with on this.</p><p>Good Day,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, phv40@h... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, I dug a bit deeper into the thing last night and found that<br/>it<br/>&gt; _is_ microtunable.

How does it feel<br/>&gt; under you fingers? Is it limited to only 15 sounds in a &quot;patch&quot; -<br/>or<br/>&gt; can you use velocity crossfading to have more? Is it easy when you<br/>&gt; are playing a number of different sounds in a patch to keep your<br/>&gt; fingers from causing vibrational crosstalk between the different<br/>&gt; areas of the head?</p><p>The pads really are sensitive enough for finger playing and are also<br/>sensitive to muting and pressure techniques.  They are also<br/>positionally sensitive.  I have not experienced crosstalk problems,<br/>but have yet to have a &quot;real&quot; hand drummer try it.</p><p>In full edit mode, the system only allows the user to select one<br/>sound per pad.  I suspect some of the sounds are either physical<br/>models or multisamples in order to make the positional sensitive<br/>performance possible (i.e. striking by the edge instead of closer to<br/>the middle).  I haven&apos;t really explored the MIDI implementation<br/>though as to whether it is possible to crossfade between, say, an<br/>internal sound and a sound on an external module.</p><p>For one pad set, you can assign 18 sounds as far as I can tell.  You<br/>can assign individual sounds to both ribbons and the D-Beam.  Total<br/>polyphony is 64.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m also a hand drummer; I play Tar, Bodhran and</p><p>I&apos;m not. :) I had 2 months of tabla lessons and played simple<br/>percussion parts on assorted gongs (for the Muslim numbers, the<br/>larger, Indonesian-like gongs, for the tribal stuff, the ones that<br/>look like frying pans without handles) when I was with a Filipino<br/>folk music and dance troupe.  I&apos;ve ordered Glen Velez&apos;s videos and<br/>dug up my conga drumming book to try to further my education in hand<br/>percussion playing</p><p>&gt; Riq - but I have used my fair share of midi percussion controllers<br/>&gt; too. One piece I&apos;ve used quite a bit is the Roland SPD Pad, which<br/>has<br/>&gt; 8 small pads - and with a pedal, you can alternate between two<br/>layers<br/>&gt; of 8 sounds for 16 total per patch.

Hey - if you put together some mp3s with this, please<br/>let<br/>&gt; us know - I&apos;d personally be interested to hear what you&apos;ve came up<br/>&gt; with on this.</p><p>To be honest, I haven&apos;t dug into the MIDI implementation yet.  There<br/>is an input for a switch pedal/kick pedal and another for an<br/>expresion pedal.  I have some friends who have invited me to jam with<br/>them.  I will try to record the sessions, should it take place, on my<br/>Minidisc recorder.  Better yet, I&apos;ll try to record the gig when a<br/>real hand drummer is playing it.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
