It is a recurrent sequence that causes the elements of triads to beat equally. Sure it oscillates and converges just as much as your ol&apos; fibonacci series into phi. He includes the  formula for finding this convergence. It is in that area before it converges though that these scales have the most musical interest, at least to Erv and myself. And we don&apos;t alway agree on such things either. look at page 4 and you will see that 268 dropped in octaves fits between 54 and 80. 54 -67- 80, each divided by 13, hence equal beating. One can also go just to<br/>where it converges and construct your scale there  and this same property of triads will also occur. One really interesting thing of this series though is how Wilson has been able to &quot;seed&quot; this formula in such a way that you have a just major scale and then proceed toward a converging point. One can thus start with a just tuning and proceed to an &quot;meantone&quot;. The other seeds have there own qualities. As with Meta slendro- the resultant music produces beating which when not equal, reinforces these beats  by having beats tuned to these beats. This is exactly what i<br/>have been doing for the last 8 years with meta mavila and meta Slendro. Meta mavila is on both the hammer dulcimer and organ pieces on &quot;from the interiors of Anaphoria CD. meta slendro although used on the wedding song on  &quot;from the island of Anaphoria&quot; is best illustrated on my upcoming CD &quot;the stolen Stars: an Anaphorian Dance Drama, which will be available in a little over a month. If you have a tuning based on beating the result is that all your intervals have basically the same degree of consonance/disonance hence allowing a freedom of melodic counterpont<br/>unattainable otherwise. The stolen stars illustrates (although the piece is NOT about &quot;tuning&quot;) 3 different compositions are superimposed in counterpoint is a very Ivesian like fashion(in the sense of having groups in counterpoint).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/meantone-mavila.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/meantone-mavila.PDF</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene, can you make any sense of this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll need some time, but glancing at the first page it discusses a<br/>&gt; linear recurrence, and erroneously states the ratios converge.
