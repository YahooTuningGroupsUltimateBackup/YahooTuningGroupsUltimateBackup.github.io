It may not get more notes in the scale for melodic possibilities (IE it<br/>seems limited as 7 notes rather than the 9 I was hoping for...but it sure is ace for 7-note<br/>scale.&nbsp; And who knows, maybe Sethares-ian overtone alignment could enable it to make a consonant 9-note scale.<br/>-------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Bela Bartok devised a whole compositional system by<br/>applying the Fibbonachi series (which approaches the Golden ratio as<br/>its upper limit) in both harmony and tempo. True, the ratio has<br/>certain recursive properties which are geometrically unique (It is<br/>the only number where its inverse equals itself minus 1). Yet at the<br/>end of the day, this really has little to do with music, which comes<br/>with its own mathematical system dating right back to the very<br/>beginnings of maths/science with Pythagoras. In fact music has its<br/>own version of recursion in tempered intervals like the square root<br/>of 2. Since octaves are equivalent in music and sqr2/1 = 2/sqr2, then<br/>it is impossible to determine which is the tonic, 1: sqr2 = sqr2: 2,<br/>such that the denominator and numerator plays precisely the same role<br/>(i.e. Given C and F#, F# is the b5 to C and C is the b5 to F# so that<br/>the ear can&apos;t tell which is the tonic).<br/>I don&apos;t think the eg you gave is more in tune than &quot;do re mi&quot; by any<br/>means and I suspect that you&apos;ve probably listened to it too much and<br/>are reading into it.</p><p>- Rick</p></div><h3><a id=80570 href="#80570">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2009 5:09:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>rick said</p><p>&quot;Yet at the<br/>end of the day, this really has little to do with music, which comes<br/>with its own mathematical system dating right back to the very<br/>beginnings of maths/science with Pythagoras.&quot;</p><p>it is these type of recurrent sequences i have been working with for the past 10 years. although they even appeared earlier in scattered applications.<br/>not only have i found many of them musically rewarding and useful. i have also stumbled upon quite a few scales in the world that fit well into these sequences.<br/>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p></div><h3><a id=80579 href="#80579">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2009 7:45:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>How about trying &quot;with it&apos;s own mathematical system dating right back to the very beginning of math(s)/science with The&nbsp;Babylonians (a couple thousand years before Pythagoras)...&quot;.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>-- Mark Rankin&nbsp;</p><p>--- On Wed, 2/4/09, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Golden ratio scale: has this been done before?<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, February 4, 2009, 5:09 PM</p><p>rick said</p><p>&quot;Yet at the<br/>end of the day, this really has little to do with music, which comes<br/>with its own mathematical system dating right back to the very<br/>beginnings of maths/science with Pythagoras.&quot;</p><p>it is these type of recurrent sequences i have been working with for<br/>the past 10 years. although they even appeared earlier in scattered<br/>applications.<br/>not only have i found many of them musically rewarding and useful. i<br/>have also stumbled upon quite a few scales in the world that fit well<br/>into these sequences.<br/>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria">http://anaphoria</a>. com/&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasou">http://anaphoriasou</a> th.blogspot. com/&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,</p></div><h3><a id=80627 href="#80627">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2009 4:44:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry for the late reply, but since I am writing something using a chain<br/>of &quot;Golden sixths&quot;, I&apos;ll chime in.</p><p>This is an overture to something that starts off with a long chord in<br/>the strings that starts on C1 in the double basses and adds the<br/>harmonics of the Fibonacci series one by one: C2, G2, E-3, C4, Ab++4,<br/>F--5, C#6, A++6, F#--7 and finally D8 (can you play a harmonic that high<br/>on violin?).

It wasn&apos;t the Babylonians who found the<br/>connection between music and maths, it was the Greeks. Our word logic<br/>comes from the Greek logos which to the Pythagoreans meant ratio,<br/>with the implication that the universe (Gk Kosmos) is ordered and<br/>harmonic. The Latin translation is ratio and is the root of words<br/>like rational etc... Try to imagine how wonderful it must have seemed<br/>to them to discover that the previously two separate worlds of the<br/>(Babylonian) series of natural numbers and (Greek) natural harmonies<br/>seemed to be saying the same thing in different ways. This led to the<br/>idea of the music of the spheres, which although incorrect, did<br/>provide the belief-system which eventually led to modern astronomy<br/>etc. It is here and nowhere else where the very idea of maths and<br/>physics come together i.e. the birth of science, which did after all<br/>begin as a western institution. And in fact a study of modern wave<br/>theory does show that Pythagoras was only incorrect in assuming that<br/>we are restricted to the small whole-numbers; the rational numbers DO<br/>lead to periodic waves, and the GCD of these waves produce the basis<br/>of modern tonality. The tradition has managed to survive underground<br/>in musical harmony and wave theory (It HAS been discovered that<br/>matter, sound and light are all forms of waves and that energy-<br/>frequency are quantised in whole numbers...is this not just the Greek<br/>Kosmos in another form?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; rick said<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Yet at the<br/>&gt; end of the day, this really has little to do with music, which comes<br/>&gt; with its own mathematical system dating right back to the very<br/>&gt; beginnings of maths/science with Pythagoras.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it is these type of recurrent sequences i have been working with<br/>for<br/>&gt; the past 10 years. although they even appeared earlier in scattered<br/>&gt; applications.<br/>&gt; not only have i found many of them musically rewarding and useful.<br/>i<br/>&gt; have also stumbled upon quite a few scales in the world that fit<br/>well<br/>&gt; into these sequences.<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; Mesotonal Music from:<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria">http://anaphoria</a>. com/&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasou">http://anaphoriasou</a> th.blogspot.<br/>com/&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80637 href="#80637">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2009 6:22:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Rankin &lt;markrankin95511@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about trying &quot;with it&apos;s own mathematical system dating right<br/>back to the very beginning of math(s)/science with The&nbsp;Babylonians (a<br/>couple thousand years before Pythagoras)...&quot;.<br/>&gt; &nbsp;<br/>&gt; -- Mark Rankin&nbsp;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- On Wed, 2/4/09, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Golden ratio scale: has this been done before?<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Wednesday, February 4, 2009, 5:09 PM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; rick said<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Yet at the<br/>&gt; end of the day, this really has little to do with music, which comes<br/>&gt; with its own mathematical system dating right back to the very<br/>&gt; beginnings of maths/science with Pythagoras.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it is these type of recurrent sequences i have been working with<br/>for<br/>&gt; the past 10 years. although they even appeared earlier in scattered<br/>&gt; applications.<br/>&gt; not only have i found many of them musically rewarding and useful.<br/>i<br/>&gt; have also stumbled upon quite a few scales in the world that fit<br/>well<br/>&gt; into these sequences.<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; Mesotonal Music from:<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria">http://anaphoria</a>. com/&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasou">http://anaphoriasou</a> th.blogspot.<br/>com/&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;, &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos; ,<br/>&gt;Hi Kraig, I too find recursive sequence very interesting and would<br/>like very much to hear some of your examples. I&apos;m not saying that the<br/>rational numbers and other systems are necessarilly mutually<br/>exclusive (The example I heard on this post sounded badly out-of-tune<br/>to me). What I do suspect is that there are other things going on in<br/>the background to do with rationality/periodicity which at the very<br/>least needs to be researched with some concerted effort. eg; the<br/>tempered minor 3rd, 2 to the power of 1/3, is usually considered<br/>irrational therefore aperiodic. But can we honestly hear an infinite<br/>number of digits? And if it is irrational, then how is it that we can<br/>use this as a tonality (i.e. as a minor key)? On the other hand, the<br/>diminished chord does not contain a tonic.</p><p>One possibility I am exploring is that these intervals are not<br/>irrational at all but are rational numbers high up in the harmonic<br/>series (and that Pythagoras&apos; restriction to small whole numbers is a<br/>bias). 609/512 you will find seems to be a very good &apos;tempered&apos; minor<br/>third. And the fact that 512 is octave equiv. to 1 produces the<br/>correct tonic (512 = 2 power of 9, ninth octave). Also, the<br/>difference between the irrational and rational form seems to be below<br/>the schisma. Squaring the interval gives 1.4147986, very close to<br/>sqr2, cubing gives 1.6828...close to min6, and power of 4 gives<br/>2.0016...close to octave. If we can&apos;t hear beyond (say) two decimal<br/>places then 2.0016 = 2, and whole &apos;chunks&apos; of rational numbers can be<br/>assigned to the same interval (and even change due to harmonic<br/>context).</p><p>So perhaps there is something similar going on with the golden ratio,<br/>which strictly speaking is an irrational number? Anyway, I&apos;d love to<br/>hear your recursive sequences (and sorry I could&apos;nt make your<br/>concert),</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=80704 href="#80704">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2009 9:13:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>---If you want to use fewer tones in an octave, 13 is the next lower number<br/>---that&apos;s maximally even.
