I would love to hear other approaches to this tuning, as I think it&apos;s a superb temperament. I&apos;ve recorded with it on 4 of my CD&apos;s, and I have acoustic tunes, space music, and some rock/fusion things as well. I have some ideas for more pieces down the road, one of which will use the cycle of 34 major 3rds as a compositional base...should be a hoot, it may take a while to get it together. My next piece in 34 will be based off a 13 note, 13 limit approximation I discovered, it&apos;s a very unusual sounding scale...we&apos;ll see where it goes...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>   <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>  <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2006 9:49:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I&apos;ve seen 34 mentioned here a few times lately; curious if anybody<br/>has done any composing in it?</p><p>No, but if we ever have a 34 thing I may go for it.</p></div>
