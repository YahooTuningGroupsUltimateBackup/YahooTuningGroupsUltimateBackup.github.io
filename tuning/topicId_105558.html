Yahoo will periodically do this<br/>sort of thing, though - sometimes the group search will not work as<br/>well. If Yahoo dropped messages, then I have no way of knowing. I know<br/>that I haven&apos;t responded to your message yet, I have about a 3/4 reply<br/>finished that I want to send off soon. As far as I can tell, we just<br/>had a two-day dropoff.</p><p>If the Group Temporarily Unavailable thing persists and becomes a<br/>problem, please let me know and I&apos;ll contact Yahoo! about it. As of<br/>now, I expect it was just a transient server hiccup.</p><p>&gt; Dave Keenan, I&apos;m wondering if this kind<br/>&gt; of problem was why I wasn&apos;t aware of your<br/>&gt; posts about the 7:9:11 question that Mike<br/>&gt; and I were discussing when I wrote and<br/>&gt; posted a reply in that thread, only learning<br/>&gt; of them later.

There&apos;s<br/>not much that we can do about it, unfortunately, short of moving the<br/>list. Thankfully, such occurrences seem to be rare.</p><p>&gt; And while this is Yahoo&apos;s problem -- unless<br/>&gt; it&apos;s some weird browser incompatibility on<br/>&gt; my end (sometimes I get strange screens<br/>&gt; saying &quot;Aren&apos;t you supposed to be somewhere<br/>&gt; else?&quot; when trying to follow a link to read<br/>&gt; a specific post in a tuning group) -- I&apos;m<br/>&gt; glad that our able and gracious moderator,<br/>&gt; Mike Battaglia, is there to help us deal<br/>&gt; with this as best we can.</p><p>What browser are you using?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
