The 12tET augmented triad might have less tonalness (more harmonic<br/>&gt;entropy), but with most timbres the lower roughness more than compensates.</p><p>Lower roughness of the tempered version?</p><p>&gt;Also, I daresay I think you&apos;ve trained yourself to like JI and dislike<br/>&gt;temperament.</p><p>Dah!</p><p>&gt;In any case, the relevant point is not whether they fill ratio space, but<br/>&gt;whether they fill ratio space with only unison vectors mapping one diamond<br/>&gt;to a neigboring one.</p><p>Right.  And they won&apos;t do that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;How do I do either of these things? (I&apos;m using Microsoft Outlook<br/>&gt;&gt;Express.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It took me a long time to find it (I use Eudora). See the menu:<br/>&gt;Tools/Accounts/Mail/Properties. I&apos;m not sure if the duplication thing will<br/>&gt;work with Outlook. But the idea is to find the folder that Outlook is in,<br/>&gt;and duplicate the whole folder. Then rename the new copy of the Outlook<br/>&gt;application to &quot;Paul&apos;s Outlook&quot;, and/or make a shortcut to it with that<br/>&gt;name and put it on the desktop.</p><p>Ouch!  Certainly outlook e. supports multiple users.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It would be good to get diverse opinions on these questions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ok folks. Start sending &apos;em in.</p><p>Well, I haven&apos;t been following, so I won&apos;t presume to answer anything in<br/>particular.  I&apos;ll just say that I find RMS to be good enough conceptually<br/>and empirically for most purposes.  (Can you site a counter-example, Dave?)</p><p>The only thing I noticed is: The distribution of (the same RMS) error<br/>across a chord can change the sound of the chord.  In particular, it may be<br/>better, when the RMS error is in a certain range, to keep one interval(s)<br/>just and heap all the error onto the other(s) than to spread the error out.</p><p>I haven&apos;t had time to test this, but it could make sense -- the just<br/>interval(s) help lock down the periodicity of the chord.  For 5-limit<br/>triads, I think all 3 intervals can be weighted equally in this context.<br/>Larger chords get tricky because of the abundance of intervals, and also<br/>because the odd limit of these intervals goes up (the 7/5, for example,<br/>shouldn&apos;t matter as much as the 7/4 in the 4:5:6:7 tetrad).</p><p>Then there is the question of what range the RMS error has to be in for<br/>this to work.  If the errors are small enough that they aren&apos;t perceptable<br/>(say, less than a cent) when broken up, then it won&apos;t work.  It also fails<br/>if the one large error moves the interval that gets it out of its entropy<br/>minima.</p><p>It is so small a deal that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth it to figure out.  Just<br/>thought I&apos;d bring it up.</p><p>&gt;&gt;-Sea.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ocean?</p><p>Phononym.</p></div><h3><a id=2513 href="#2513">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
