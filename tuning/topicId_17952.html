He provided both 7 and 11/13-<br/>limit versions of the two variations of the theme. Both of these<br/>sound remarkably good and have a very different sound in the<br/>harmonies. It&apos;s really hard to say in this case which I like best. I<br/>think it has to be a dead tie! The 11/13 versions have a darker sound<br/>that just blows me away - but both are extraordinary.</p><p>    2.   &quot;North by Northwest&quot;:  northcr11.mid, northcr7.mid</p><p>Now &quot;North by Northwest&quot; is another story. This is where I really<br/>have connected in the most significant way with John&apos;s tuning<br/>goals. &quot;North by Northwest&quot; is an extremely dissonant theme, and the<br/>12tET version of this was so &quot;painful&quot; to listen to - I mean really<br/>uncomfortably &quot;tense&quot; sounding. Well, John&apos;s program gave this<br/>sequence the most wonderful depth, as to make one think that *he*<br/>made this midi file - difference of day and night. It&apos;s a real jaw<br/>dropper to hear the magic it worked on this piece - especially with<br/>regard to the absolutely beautiful way the organ is being tuned<br/>throughout the composition.  I agree with John on this one - I seem<br/>to prefer the 7 limit version, but the 11/13 is also, if not equally<br/>wonderful sounding. I love it when the 11/13 really breaks<br/>Xenharmonic at points.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The effect of &quot;Pain&quot; reduction is something I now understand<br/>empirically, thanks to John&apos;s amazing display of tunery. The effect<br/>that this had on these midi files is like that of taking a 2<br/>dimensional image, and making it into a 3d animation - it just<br/>breaths life into the sequence, making it sound more &quot;real&quot;. One can<br/>easily transpose that this is why &quot;12tET&quot; acoustic orchestral music<br/>sounds so great; it&apos;s not playing in 12tET exactly. His program adds<br/>in the effect of a &quot;human like&quot; real-time pitch adjustment to bring<br/>chord simultaneities into better Just alignment - thus the<br/>name &quot;Adaptive&quot;. This also succeeds in the area of tuning harmonic<br/>timbres - which makes one realize the potentials of turning this<br/>noble science onto the inharmonic series as well. I was very excited<br/>when I heard John&apos;s Big Band tunings recently, and have wanted to see<br/>how some Herrmann would come off. I am humbled by the mind that can<br/>create things like this.</p><p>I have uploaded all of the midis to the below files section, so that<br/>all may experience John deLaubenfels&apos; fine handiwork (breathtaking!):</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/Ligon+FFT/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/Ligon+FFT/</a></p><p>Please note that the original midis are in the zip file<br/>labeled &quot;<a href="http://Herrmann-12tETmidis.zip">Herrmann-12tETmidis.zip</a>&quot;, for those who may care to be<br/>dazzled by a little bit of comparative listening. I recommend it -<br/>hear the 12tET first then play his, and you&apos;ll surely hear the magic<br/>like I did!</p><p>Here are Johns notes too about the tunings:</p><p>Psycho2cr11.dbg (2001 Jan 25 05:57:26):<br/>     1  Didn&apos;t have to drop any notes; used 6 channels.<br/>     2  12-tET Total          spring pain:      987527.039<br/>     3  Werckmeister III      spring pain:     1240537.086<br/>     4  Kirnberger III Total  spring pain:     1211502.177<br/>     5  Thomas Young Total    spring pain:     1183826.060<br/>     6  COFT Total            spring pain:      735258.362<br/>     7  After relaxing, Total spring pain:      167072.428<br/>     8  Final vertical        spring pain:       67778.999<br/>     9  Final horizontal      spring pain:       22907.051<br/>    10  Final grounding       spring pain:       76386.378<br/>[end]</p><p>Psycho2cr7.dbg (2001 Jan 25 05:48:44):<br/>     1  Didn&apos;t have to drop any notes; used 6 channels.<br/>     2  12-tET Total          spring pain:      768779.674<br/>     3  Werckmeister III      spring pain:     1026233.362<br/>     4  Kirnberger III Total  spring pain:      996088.274<br/>     5  Thomas Young Total    spring pain:      966088.589<br/>     6  COFT Total            spring pain:      581019.085<br/>     7  After relaxing, Total spring pain:      243479.457<br/>     8  Final vertical        spring pain:      185959.785<br/>     9  Final horizontal      spring pain:       17774.048<br/>    10  Final grounding       spring pain:       39745.624<br/>[end]</p><p>Psychocr11.dbg (2001 Jan 25 05:57:02):<br/>     1  Didn&apos;t have to drop any notes; used 6 channels.<br/>     2  12-tET Total          spring pain:     1113549.267<br/>     3  Werckmeister III      spring pain:     1387223.742<br/>     4  Kirnberger III Total  spring pain:     1352158.296<br/>     5  Thomas Young Total    spring pain:     1318338.020<br/>     6  COFT Total            spring pain:      840512.575<br/>     7  After relaxing, Total spring pain:      181734.416<br/>     8  Final vertical        spring pain:       71414.252<br/>     9  Final horizontal      spring pain:       20747.615<br/>    10  Final grounding       spring pain:       89572.548<br/>[end]</p><p>Psychocr7.dbg (2001 Jan 25 05:48:24):<br/>     1  Didn&apos;t have to drop any notes; used 6 channels.<br/>     2  12-tET Total          spring pain:      897878.790<br/>     3  Werckmeister III      spring pain:     1185510.151<br/>     4  Kirnberger III Total  spring pain:     1156645.868<br/>     5  Thomas Young Total    spring pain:     1120319.651<br/>     6  COFT Total            spring pain:      670996.025<br/>     7  After relaxing, Total spring pain:      267348.679<br/>     8  Final vertical        spring pain:      197895.006<br/>     9  Final horizontal      spring pain:       23296.417<br/>    10  Final grounding       spring pain:       46157.256</p><p>BTW, I&apos;m using fairly rigid vertical springs, meaning that the chords<br/>are generally forced to be quite close to JI, at some cost to<br/>horizontal<br/>consistency.
