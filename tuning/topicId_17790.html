Go to &lt;<a href="http://www.korg.com/oasyspci_manuals.htm">http://www.korg.com/oasyspci_manuals.htm</a>&gt; and<br/>download the Users Guide.  Page 110 (by the numbering at the bottom of<br/>the page, 114 by the PDF file&apos;s numbering) shows the tuning<br/>capability.  It works!</p><p>I can&apos;t copy and paste from the PDF file, probably a security thing.<br/>But this is beautiful!  1 cent resolution, full keyboard scales.<br/>&quot;Scales are text files.&quot;  Format is like:</p><p>d2 E3 +100 D2 becomes F3.</p><p>A bit of tweaking and Scala could churn these out!  If not, a trivial<br/>little Python script.</p><p>&gt; Please clarify:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some SoftSynths and SoftSamplers have tuning tables<br/>&gt; Is &quot;tunng tables&quot; the key phrase?<br/>&gt; If the softsynth has tuning tables, regardless<br/>&gt; of one soundcard, they have micrtuning capability?</p><p>Yes, &quot;tuning tables&quot; are what you want.  Specifically &quot;user tuning<br/>tables&quot; because some digital pianos only give you preset tables.</p><p>Any sampler can be made microtonal by using a sample for each note,<br/>and lying about the pitch.  It means a lot of work, but some people<br/>do it.</p><p>&gt; So what makes a sound card<br/>&gt; microtunable is the software?</p><p>Ultimately, everything with digital synthesis is software.<br/>Unfortunately, with hardware synths, you aren&apos;t allowed to change the<br/>software, so if the manufacturer decided not to give you tuning tables<br/>you don&apos;t get tuning tables.  With a soundcard you could, in theory,<br/>write your own driver.  Creative Labs cards use the same chips as Emu<br/>synthesizers, so there&apos;s no reason why they shouldn&apos;t have the same<br/>microtonal capabilities.  I&apos;m assuming the tuning is set by the<br/>driver, rather than an extra chip on the card.  If the card you&apos;re<br/>interested in has Free Linux drivers, you could check by downloading<br/>the source code and looking for anything that looks like a list of 12<br/>frequencies.  You don&apos;t need to know C for this.  You could even alter<br/>that table to get a soundcard that&apos;s jammed into, say, Werckmeister<br/>instead of 12-equal.  But you&apos;re unlikely to get the source code to<br/>the Windows or Macintosh drivers, and writing them from scratch will<br/>be very difficult.</p><p>&gt; Is the Pulsar l and ll microtunable?<br/>&gt; Does its software provide for microtuning?</p><p>If it isn&apos;t on the list, assume it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Sorry for all the questions.<br/>&gt; I have been out of the music making for a while!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does GigaStudio softSampler have &quot;tunng tables&quot;?</p><p>If you mean GigaSampler, I don&apos;t know, and would still like to.  The<br/>website is &lt;<a href="http://www.nemesysmusic.com/products/gigasamp.html">http://www.nemesysmusic.com/products/gigasamp.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt; So it seems that Reaktor will be my only choice.</p><p>No.  There&apos;s CSound if you don&apos;t need real-time, the AudioComposer<br/>that was mentioned after you wrote that, and the Unity DS-1 I found<br/>out about by searching through my own posts.  See<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bitheadz.com/">http://www.bitheadz.com/</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt; I am building a new PC midi studio and have to<br/>&gt; make some decisions soon.<br/>&gt; I must have software with tuning tabels.<br/>&gt; I does not seem very promiising even if<br/>&gt; my scales are 12 tone or less?<br/>&gt; Does this help any?</p><p>If the &quot;microtonal scaling&quot; is what I think it is, a 12 note scale<br/>would be harder to get working than 24-equal or 88-CET.  But the Unity<br/>DS-1 looks like a good sampler, and does have 12-note octave tables.<br/>So the software does exist.</p><p>If you think GigaSampler would suit you, one option would be to<br/>contact them and say &quot;you can have my $300 for the Full Edition if you<br/>give me tuning tables.&quot;  If enough people do that, they&apos;ll add the<br/>feature.</p><p>&gt; One additional problem I have is that I need high<br/>&gt; polyphony, lets say over 100 mono notes.<br/>&gt; Ido not beleive that I can build a fast enough<br/>&gt; computer to occomplish this.</p><p>This is a lot.  A standard Kyma system can only get 60 notes, so I&apos;d<br/>be surprised if a soft synth could do much better.  They might do a<br/>bit better if they&apos;re only reading samples from the hard disk, and not<br/>doing much to them.  GigaSampler only promises 64 notes, but that must<br/>be hardware dependent.  So you&apos;ll either need to use CSound in<br/>non-real time mode, find a soundcard that suits, or get an external<br/>synth.  Kyma could do it with a couple of expansion cards, but we&apos;re<br/>talking about $5000.  You can get a hardware sampler with octave<br/>tuning tables for less than that.</p><p>Of course, PCs are getting faster all the time, and the Kyma hardware<br/>is getting out date now, so perhaps I&apos;m being pessimistic.</p><p>So a lot depends on your budget.  You may well find it&apos;s easier to<br/>multitrack soft synths to the hard disc, than expect everything to<br/>play in real time.  For that you&apos;ll need an audio sequencer like<br/>Logic, Cubase or Cakewalk, and Kyma can also do it.</p><p>However, now it seems that Oasys does do everything you need, you<br/>won&apos;t need much from a soft synth in addition.</p><p>          Graham</p></div>
