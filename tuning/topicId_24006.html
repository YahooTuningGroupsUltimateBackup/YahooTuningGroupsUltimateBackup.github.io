In that regard, I must say I really respect what Reinhard and crew<br/>have done over the years by playing all sorts of music in all sorts of<br/>tunings; I believe they&apos;ve set a really high standard, and that&apos;s the<br/>kind of horizons I like to aim for...infinite. It&apos;s very inspiring. To<br/>try and standardize microtonality sems realy confining to me.<br/>    Also, are we microtonalists really seen as a &quot;disunified, crazy and<br/>irrelevant&quot; group? That&apos;s news to me...maybe I&apos;m missing something. Here<br/>in Denver, the reception to what we have done with non 12 tunings has<br/>largely been very positive, with a lot of folks who seem to be really<br/>curious and interested with the subject. For example, I just finished a<br/>play, where I played 34 tone guitar (and a bit of purely tuned<br/>fretless), which received very good reviews (especially for the music),<br/>and was seen by thousands of folks; most of what I heard/read about this<br/>show was very encouraging. I&apos;m not sure where you are getting your info,<br/>but that&apos;s too bad...from what I see happening around the country,<br/>people seem to be responding pretty well to the concept of microtonal<br/>music...I&apos;m sorry that you seem to be getting a negative<br/>impression...hopefully, you&apos;re wrong...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=24009 href="#24009">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 10:12:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Err, Paul,</p><p>I&apos;m glad you&apos;ve found a way to do your decatonics in 72-EDO, but<br/>please don&apos;t forget that the single most popular temperament of all<br/>time, namely meantone, is disrespected just as badly by 72-EDO as it<br/>is by 12-EDO.</p><p>Let&apos;s just recognise that 72-EDO unifies a huge number of temperaments<br/>including some that are wafso-just and quasi-just, and the notation<br/>can be used consistently out to 17-limit just, and performers can<br/>cope well with it because its an extension of 12-tET, but there&apos;s<br/>still a lot that it leaves out.</p><p>Aren&apos;t cents and ratios enough of a lingua-franca.</p></div><h3><a id=24029 href="#24029">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2001 1:28:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;    Yikes, Paul...about the last thing I want to see is some sort of<br/>new<br/>&gt; standard tuning...I want to see many and varied tuning systems,</p><p>Me too.

Why are you wasting your time on<br/>that?&quot;.</p><p>And very recently I got an email from someone who otherwise<br/>praised my &quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot; webpage<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a><br/>(which covers much of the ground I presented at Microfest)<br/>except that I placed too much emphasis on microtonality.<br/>I just went back to find his email so that I could quote<br/>something, and found a whole new tirade from him questioning<br/>why I&apos;m trying to tie the great Schoenberg in with this<br/>&quot;out-of-tune bullshit&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Microthon 2000 didn&apos;t even get a review I don&apos;t think.<br/>&gt; Or should *that* tell me something...</p><p>I think you answered your own question, Marc.  The lack<br/>of any &quot;published&quot; review at all for last year&apos;s Microthon<br/>(if indeed that was the case... I too do not know of one)<br/>speaks volumes for the public disinterest in the topic.</p><p>The reviews that I know of are all partial and were<br/>all written for this list:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15466">/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15466</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15471">/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15471</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15472.html#15472">/tuning/topicId_15472.html#15472</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15473">/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15473</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15474">/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15474</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15475.html#15475">/tuning/topicId_15475.html#15475</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15472.html#15477">/tuning/topicId_15472.html#15477</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15472.html#15484">/tuning/topicId_15472.html#15484</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15488">/tuning/topicId_15464.html#15488</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15497.html#15497">/tuning/topicId_15497.html#15497</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15497.html#15504">/tuning/topicId_15497.html#15504</a></p><p>Many of us here on these tuning lists are passionately<br/>devoted to microtonal music and/or theory, and it&apos;s easy<br/>for us to forget what a small fringe subset of the larger<br/>population we really are.</p><p>Sure, many musicians make microtonal music every day,<br/>but there are an awful lot of them who don&apos;t realize<br/>they&apos;re doing it, and many who do and simply aren&apos;t<br/>much interested in that aspect of their music-making.</p><p>I know lots of rock guitarists who prize the &quot;off-pitch&quot;<br/>bent notes they play in their solos, but they&apos;re not<br/>going to spend any time contemplating the mathematics<br/>or theory of it - they just do it by ear, and there are<br/>lots of other things going into their solos; the microtonal<br/>notes are only one part of it.</p><p>So it&apos;s important for us to remember to keep microtonality<br/>in perspective when we&apos;re talking about music as a whole.</p><p>I think Paul&apos;s ideas about a 72-EDO standard are great.<br/>He&apos;s not trying to create another ready-made hegemony<br/>that will lord over all musicians and force them to<br/>think only in 72-EDO.  He just thinks it would be<br/>advantageous to all of us to have *some* kind of<br/>comprehensive tuning standard other than 12-EDO taught<br/>to musicians-in-training.  And I agree totally - I<br/>think it&apos;s a terrific plan.</p><p>If your future masses of average run-of-the-mill<br/>conservatory students come out of their four years of<br/>schooling with as deep a knowledge of 72-EDO as the<br/>current ones get of 12-EDO, think of how much easier<br/>it would be for them to understand and work in<br/>any number of =&lt; 11-limit JI and MIRACLE tunings<br/>and poly-tunings, as well as 36-, 24-, 18-, 9-,<br/>and 8-EDO, and without sacrificing the current<br/>knowledge of 12-EDO!</p><p>I beg all of you who disagreed with Paul to give it some<br/>more thought.  As long as we discuss tuning here on the<br/>internet, the hard-core tuning community will make sure<br/>that the variety of tunings in use reflects the variety<br/>of personalities using them.  Having another tuning<br/>standard which *simultaneously includes and supercedes<br/>the current one* can only make things better.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=24150 href="#24150">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/31/2001 8:19:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24006.html#24147">/tuning/topicId_24006.html#24147</a></p><p>&gt; On 5/31/01 10:50 PM, &quot;jpehrson@r...&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really.
