Take every other one of Db Eb Gb Ab Bb C D E F G A B, both odd<br/>and even step choices, and get two different Major + Minor hexachords.<br/>Both have a spooky &quot;astrological&quot; Holst-Planets-like sound.</p><p>2. This cool chain: G Bb Db Eb Gb A B D F which could be considered<br/>an Eb 7 M7 9 #9 #11 b13 chord, the #9 acts to make it Major-Minor,<br/>taking pieces of this is like a very bluesy chord, taken over three key signatures</p><p>3. The Messaien hexatuply layered alternating octotonic scales I mentioned previously.</p><p>Scale 1 would be best tuned in augmented tuning, Scale 2 would work in many kinds of tuning, with emphasis on 7-limit regular temperaments, and Scale 3 I guess would work best in diminished tunings (or those temperaments divisible by 4)</p><p>PGH</p></div>
