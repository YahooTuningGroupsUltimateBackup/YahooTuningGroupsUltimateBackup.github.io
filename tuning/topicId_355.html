Who is goldsmith and did he actually<br/>make it. Although it is derived from the Chopi is S.E. Africa it bares<br/>strong resemblance to a pelog, more of the sumatra and burma type of scale,<br/>but I sure Wolf can fill us in on this one.  For those who don&apos;t know,  the<br/>indonesians were colonizing Madagascar and S.E. Africa between 100-700AD.<br/>Its hard to say who got the scale from who. I have also seem Slendro like<br/>tunings in west Africa. I could see using the Greek letters but it seems<br/>maybe Chopi letters would be better. Despite Wilsons use of mixing greek<br/>with traditional, I have personally found it not to my liking. All greek<br/>would be better. For notation I don&apos;t worry about letter names though. I<br/>just use a klarscripo notation of 4 lines alternating with 3 lines!
