I bought Dewey&apos;s book on Cycles back in the 60s and it became my bible.  I loved looking through his lists of identical recurring events like floods and famines.  What could be more pertinent to life.  A theory that says you might be able to predict the future?</p><p>I kept thinking he could help with my finances and I embraced Batra&apos;s gloom and doom at the beginning of the 90s, only to be proved wrong.  You should have seen me in my investment club.  I felt like an idiot as a contrarian while everyone else was buying tech stocks.  But then now with Enron et al, maybe Batra  was right?</p><p>I find topics like cycles and vibrations fascinating. Especially as a former percussionist.  Just because a cycle slows out of the tonal range doesn&apos;t make it less relevant to music.  And by analogy something slowed down so that it is completely out of the audible range still retains, for me, musical interest.  In fact, just the before your message was posted, I was trying to explain my music in terms of astronomy and your email just came along to prove my point.

(See my previous papers in the Bulletin: &quot;Bode&apos;s Law<br/>Explained,&quot; Cycles 30: 82, 1979, and &quot;On the Special Theory of<br/>Order,&quot; Cycles 36: 219, 1985.)  Therefore, if the clock pattern is<br/>applied to our solar-planetary system--both systems involve objects<br/>in 360-degree motion around their respective centers--any two planets<br/>will cross only a certain number of times.  Thereafter, the pattern<br/>repeats.  (see my paper: &quot;Why the sunspot cycle 22 years long?&quot;<br/>Cycles 46: 3, 1996.</p><p>As I pointed out in my previously cited papers, the primary cause of<br/>the full-wave 22-year sunspot cycle is the Saturn-Uranus synodic<br/>cycle.  These two planets cross &quot;only 22 times&quot; before the pattern<br/>repeats.</p><p>Whereas a clock has only two hands, the solar-planetary system is not<br/>made up of a mere two planets; the cumulative effect of each set of<br/>two planets must be computed as they relate to the others.  In<br/>addition, the solar-planetary electrical and magnetic field in which<br/>the multitude of planets move and cross, is, itself, in motion with<br/>respect to the center of the galaxy.  Also, the planets are<br/>precessing with respect to the distant star field.  Consequently, our<br/>solar-planetary system will not behave as methematically precise as a<br/>clock.  Indeed, each individual ww-year cycle varies immensely, from<br/>about 20.8 to about 27 years.<br/>In The Old Farmer&apos;s Almanac 1981, Guy Murchie popularized my theory<br/>by reference to my publications, asking: &quot;Is there order among the<br/>planets?  Or, as Pythagoras once put it, is there Music in the<br/>Spheres?&quot;</p><p>I published Arnold&apos;s Law in 1979, as follows:</p><p>Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal Mean**<br/>       Or Perimeter</p><p>Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles<br/>Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28<br/>Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42<br/>Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56<br/>Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12<br/>Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24<br/>Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49<br/>Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74<br/>Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99</p><p>*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;</p><p>**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet</p><p>In conclusion, I urge interested readers to review the detailed<br/>heliocentric data and patterns pub lished in my earlier papers.<br/>Perhaps someone can generate a full-scale computer analysis to<br/>confirm why the sunspot cycle averages 22 years.</p><p>Bill Arnold</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>New DSL Internet Access from SBC &amp; Yahoo!<br/><a href="http://sbc.yahoo.com">http://sbc.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39219 href="#39219">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Arnold &#x3C;billarnoldfla@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2002 8:37:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto writes, &quot;Mark, This is good.
