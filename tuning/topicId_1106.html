He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy<br/>creation. He does not know love.</p><p>After further questions about the events in America, I said that such<br/>a plan appeared to be Lucifer&apos;s greatest work of art. Of course I<br/>used the designation &quot;work of art&quot; to mean the work of destruction<br/>personified in Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was<br/>unequivocal.</p><p>I cannot find a fitting name for such a &quot;satanic composition&quot;. In my<br/>case, it was not and is not my intention to hurt anyone. Since the<br/>beginning of the attack onward I have felt solidarity with all of the<br/>human beings mourning this atrocity.</p><p>Not for one moment have I thought or felt the way my words are now<br/>being interpreted in the press.</p><p>The journalist in Hamburg completely ripped my statements out of a<br/>context, which he had not recorded in its entirety, to use it as a<br/>vile attack against my person and the Hamburg Music Festival.</p><p>This whole situation is regrettable and I am deeply sorry if my<br/>remarks were misconstrued to offend the grieving families of the<br/>brutal terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. I will<br/>continue to keep the victims of this outrage in my prayers</p><p>Karlheinz Stockhausen<br/>September 19, 2001</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>----------</p><p>Statement by Webmaster<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s comments during the Hamburg interview were delivered in<br/>the context of a metaphoric line of questioning. He provided an<br/>allegorical answer to an allegorical question.</p><p>Anyone who knows Stockhausen can tell you that he is a compassionate<br/>and thoughtful person. The journalist who spewed forth this<br/>unconscionable poison should immediately retract his untruthful<br/>reporting and publish an apology to Stockhausen.</p><p>I live in the USA and we are doing our best with God&apos;s help to get<br/>through this cowardly and hateful attack on our nation by terrorists.</p><p>I also serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of a Fire<br/>Protection District. I personally am acquainted with heroic fire<br/>fighters from our area who are tirelessly laboring at Ground Zero in<br/>NYC. As a loyal and patriotic American, I can tell you that Karlheinz<br/>Stockhausen is not the kind of man to condone terrorism in ANY form.</p><p>On September 13 Kathinka Pasveer sent me a thoughtful fax from<br/>Karlheinz, Suzee Stephens (who is American) and herself that said &quot;We<br/>all follow the tragedy in the USA and pray for you all. So terrible.&quot;</p><p>The reporter who wrote this rubbish for the sake of his own financial<br/>and professional gain should be condemned by the public for his<br/>sensational lies and promptly fired by his employer.</p><p>James Stonebraker, Webmaster<br/>St. Louis, Missouri USA<br/>September 19, 2001</p></div>
