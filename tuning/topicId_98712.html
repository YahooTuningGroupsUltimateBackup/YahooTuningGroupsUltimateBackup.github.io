Blogger seems to have crashed, so I&apos;ll post my comments here:</p><p>You talk about equally dividing the tetrachord into 3 parts -<br/>congrats, you have rediscovered porcupine temperament. The way to go<br/>here is to make the fourth a little flat, so that what you were<br/>calling a &quot;neutral&quot; third gets closer to a minor third. 22-equal is a<br/>near-ideal tuning for this. 15-equal and 37-equal support it as well.<br/>You might want to consider the mode with all generators going down -<br/>i.e. 4333333 in 22-equal. As you can see, this has 11-limit<br/>implications. Many people like porcupine[8], which is 13333333, but<br/>ymmv. If instead you divide the tetrachord into 4 parts, you end up<br/>with Negri temperament, which 19-equal is a good tuning for.</p><p>WRT 19-equal, you might still find that some pieces written in<br/>12-equal just don&apos;t work - ones that subtly make use of the 128/125 or<br/>648/625 unison vectors, which 19-equal doesn&apos;t vanish like 12-equal<br/>does. This shouldn&apos;t pose too much of a problem, but you ought to be<br/>aware of it - for example, if you ever use the altered scale over<br/>dominant chords, things aren&apos;t going to line up the same. You should<br/>also be aware that 19-equal has a lot more tonal systems in it than<br/>12-equal - it supports magic, sensi, negri, semaphore, hanson, etc,<br/>all in addition to the usual meantone. Also, 19-equal has been much<br/>maligned for its lack of a strong 7 and 11, but it does have a pretty<br/>good 13/10, so that you can turn minor 10:12:15 triads into<br/>10:12:13:15 tetrads. Lastly, if you&apos;re trying to explore the 5-limit<br/>for now, you might also want to check out 22-equal, which is of about<br/>the same size as 19 but does NOT support meantone, so it really forces<br/>you to think out of the box.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98716 href="#98716">ðŸ”—</a>Callahan White &#x3C;cortaigne@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2011 1:09:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Heehee, glad it didn&apos;t take long for someone to get it!

I&apos;ve seen the explanation for meantone before, as I understand it&apos;s of historical significance, but if I&apos;ve seen a good explanation for the different *kinds* of meantone it must have been long before I had any idea what it meant. The first preset tunings listed in Logic Pro are &quot;1/2-comma meantone,&quot; &quot;1/4-comma meantone with equal beating fifths,&quot; &quot;1/4-comma meantone, 6/5 beats twice 3/2 (Pietro Aaron, 1523),&quot; &quot;1/6-comma meantone scale (Salinas tritonic),&quot; and &quot;1/6-comma meantone with equal beating fifths,&quot; and there are many other tunings later in the list with &quot;meantone&quot; in their name.

I&apos;m looking at the xenharmonic wiki page on the Porcupine family, and it just reminds me how much more there is to learn.

So the [8] means there are eight steps? What about something like 22333333?</p><p>The 8 means that you stack 8 porcupine &quot;generators&quot; on top of one<br/>another. The generator for porcupine is a flat 10/9, and the period is<br/>a 2/1. Rather than explain it formally, I&apos;d just leave it at this:<br/>meantone[7] is the major scale, and you get it by taking a chain of 7<br/>meantone generators and smushing them within the meantone period. The<br/>meantone generator is a fifth, and the meantone period is an octave.<br/>So you can confirm that a stack of 7 fifths lands you the diatonic<br/>scale. You get different modes depending on how many fifths go up from<br/>the root and how many go down (major is one fifth down, the rest up).</p><p>Porcupine[8] is also an &quot;MOS&quot; of porcupine, which means it&apos;s a &quot;moment<br/>of symmetry&quot; scale for that temperament. MOS scales are ones in which<br/>every generic interval class comes in two sizes. For example,<br/>meantone[7] is an MOS, because there are only two sizes of second -<br/>major and minor - and two sizes of third - major and minor - and two<br/>sizes of fourth - perfect and augmented - etc. Meantone[5] is also an<br/>MOS, and so is meantone[12]. Meantone[6] doesn&apos;t form an MOS. These<br/>scales are useful as starting points for the temperament you&apos;re trying<br/>to explore, but you don&apos;t need to stick to the MOS&apos;s by any means<br/>(sometimes it makes more sense not to).</p><p>Some ways to figure out the generator for a temperament</p><p>1) Magic<br/>2) Voodoo<br/>3) Figure out how the temperament you want creates a subspace of the<br/>JI lattice and figure out what the set of basis vectors of this<br/>subspace is<br/>4) Ask on the list</p><p>I used to think that #4 was the main way to do it, but now I&apos;m<br/>exploring #3 as a viable option. Alternately, there&apos;s Graham&apos;s<br/>temperament finder here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/">http://x31eq.com/temper/</a></p><p>You&apos;ll probably need a bit more catching up before any of it makes<br/>sense to you though.</p><p>&gt; Excellent information! I&apos;ve seen the explanation for meantone before, as I understand it&apos;s of historical significance, but if I&apos;ve seen a good explanation for the different *kinds* of meantone it must have been long before I had any idea what it meant. The first preset tunings listed in Logic Pro are &quot;1/2-comma meantone,&quot; &quot;1/4-comma meantone with equal beating fifths,&quot; &quot;1/4-comma meantone, 6/5 beats twice 3/2 (Pietro Aaron, 1523),&quot; &quot;1/6-comma meantone scale (Salinas tritonic),&quot; and &quot;1/6-comma meantone with equal beating fifths,&quot; and there are many other tunings later in the list with &quot;meantone&quot; in their name. Are you able to shed some light on these as well?</p><p>Those are specific tunings for the abstract meantone temperament in<br/>general. 1/4 comma meantone means that every fifth is flattened by<br/>1/4th of 81/80, so that four of them lands you a perfect 5, and so the<br/>5/4&apos;s are perfect at the expense of the 3/2&apos;s (this is almost exactly<br/>identical to 31-equal). 1/3 comma meantone does the same, but with<br/>minor thirds (this is almost exactly identical to 19-equal). I<br/>wouldn&apos;t worry about the equal beating stuff now. But they are<br/>specific tunings of meantone temperament.</p><p>&gt; Augmented and diminished temperament are entirely new to me. Are they useful? :-)</p><p>Sure - diminished is used all the time in jazz over dominant 7 chords.<br/>Diminished[8] has a generator of a half step and a period of a minor<br/>third. In 12-equal, the scale is</p><p>C Db D# E F# G A Bb C (dominant mode)<br/>C D Eb F Gb Ab A B C (diminished mode)</p><p>Diminished[12] has a beautiful sound as well - in 12-equal, it&apos;s the<br/>same as meantone[12], but you can kind of snap your brain around to<br/>hear it differently.</p><p>&gt; Okay, I&apos;ve definitely heard of tempering out a comma before, and had a vague idea it meant something like that. So ... is a &quot;unison vector&quot; any very small interval?</p><p>No, it&apos;s just that the comma you&apos;re tempering out is called the unison<br/>vector. If you aren&apos;t tempering it, it doesn&apos;t become a unison. We<br/>call it a &quot;vector&quot; because some guy named Fokker worked all of this<br/>out with something called the JI lattice, which is a vector space.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98729 href="#98729">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2011 4:07:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I must admit I don&apos;t get the joke from the name - could some one elighten<br/>me?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Fri, Apr 29, 2011 at 3:58 PM, Kalle Aho &lt;<a href="mailto:kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi">kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi</a>&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Callahan White&quot; &lt;cortaigne@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t mean to spam the list, but I just started a blog and a lot of<br/>&gt; what I have in mind is definitely related to tuning and microtonal<br/>&gt; composition and performance.

However, all this equal beating stuff sometimes screws up how this simple idea is presented. 6/5 doesn&apos;t beat with 6/5 beating precisely twice 3/2 in 1/4 comma meantone (its 2.5 times, not 2 times), so requiring that it does actually leads to a different meantone, with a fifth of 696.296 cents, rather than the 696.578 cents of 1/4 comma meantone.
