It is a justification or explanation of how I arrived at the idea<br/>that as we move from the bass to the treble we want to change key by<br/>adding a sharp or removing a flat.</p><p>In fact, as me move to higher notes the prime indices all want to be<br/>higher so that in the Blues the notes with the 7 ratio (Ebv and Bbv)<br/>should be favoured in the treble only and not in the base.  Some<br/>appreciation of what I am on about here can be gained by looking at the<br/>diagrams listed here from my web site which are the result of haronics<br/>calculations which I believe reasonably accurately represent the nature<br/>of the universe ...</p><p>In this diagram the pattern of harmonics is presented<br/> <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-nm.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-nm.gif</a></p><p>In these two diagrams the harmonics are labelled with notes (the<br/>notation is NOT consistent with this post and should be ignored).<br/> <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-mx.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-mx.gif</a><br/> <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-my.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-ha-my.gif</a><br/>From this you can see how the key shifts from F around (2) to C around<br/>(48) to G around (288).  Then a minor flavour develops around (2880) and<br/>it comes back to a major at (17280).</p><p>I believe that all natural music comes from structures that look like<br/>this.  The reason is that such a structure has the absolute maximum<br/>amount of harmonic content right to its very core and in as many ways as<br/>possible.  This is a bit of a sideline from the main argument, but I<br/>wanted to justify my statement about the drift of all the prime indices<br/>at higher frequencies.</p><p>All sorts of things can happen because of this.  For example, C might<br/>have relative frequncies of 1, 2, 4, 8 in the lower octaves but<br/>eventually it might become 126, 252, 504 rather than 128 etc in the<br/>higher ocatves.  That is always assuming that we are spanning enough<br/>octaves.  For example, try the chord C Bb D D F C spanning 3 octaves.<br/>It can be interpreted as 8:14:18:36:42:63 so that the two &quot;C&quot;s are not<br/>in tune according to standard ideas.  This is quite unrelated to my main<br/>argument and just a curiosity really.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
