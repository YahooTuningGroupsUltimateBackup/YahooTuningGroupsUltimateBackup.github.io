This is the passage I remembered, pp. 39-40:</p><p>&#x9;&quot;W&#xFFFD;rschmidt, in his theory of rational tone-systems, has made one of<br/>the most penetrating analyses of the qualities and possibilities of the<br/>various equal-tempered systems within the context of the web of fifths and<br/>thirds. He is particularly concerned with two kinds of minute intervals<br/>which he considers particularly important to tempered systems. The first he<br/>calls defining (definierend) intervals. These are the very small intervals<br/>in the web of 5ths and 3rds which are made to disappear (made equal to zero)<br/>in the process of building a specific tempered system. The syntonic comma,<br/>for example, is a defining interval in 12-tone temperament, as is the major<br/>diesis. The second kind, W&#xFFFD;rschmidt calls constructing (konstuierend)<br/>intervals. These are the intervals each of which is equal to one unit of a<br/>tempered system. The constructing intervals in 12-tone temperament are the<br/>various kinds of semitones such as 16:15 and 25:24. It is W&#xFFFD;rschmidt&apos;s basic<br/>contention that a rational system is one in which the largest defining<br/>interval is smaller than the smallest constructing interval. The rational<br/>systems, according to W&#xFFFD;rschmidt, are 5-, 7-, 10-, 12-, 19-, 22-, 31-, 34-,<br/>53-, and 118-tone temperaments.&quot;</p><p>What I didn&apos;t remember was the footnote:</p><p>&quot;W&#xFFFD;rschmidt does pose a limit on the expanse of his system for, if he did<br/>not, other small intervals far removed from musical practice would interfere<br/>with his calculations. He chooses as limits 11 fifths and 27 thirds to<br/>eliminate the very small discrepancies from the octave created by the 12th<br/>fifth (the Pythagorean comma) and by the 28th third (which exceeds the ninth<br/>octave by only a few cents).&quot;</p><p>Mandelbaum and/or W&#xFFFD;rschmidt call 128:125 the &quot;major diesis,&quot; contradicting<br/>Keenan&apos;s recent definitions. Is there an accepted convention on this?<br/>Manuel?</p></div>
