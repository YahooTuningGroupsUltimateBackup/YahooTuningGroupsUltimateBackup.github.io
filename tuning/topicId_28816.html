They sold out the hall<br/>&gt; in San Francisco (as well they should), and I&apos;ll have to do more to<br/>&gt; publicize stuff on the other end of the country, I guess...</p><p>Montclair isn&apos;t exactly a major American city, plus you<br/>have to account for the WTC terror and folks who<br/>have a &quot;I&apos;ve seen Newband already&quot; attitude. And<br/>also New Yorkers who can&apos;t be bothered to come<br/>out to NJ. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any train service to Montclair<br/>on the weekends.</p><p>I was at the concert yesterday. Positively amazing.<br/>Bravo. A virtuoso performance. They performed<br/>San Francisco and Barstow. Then Pedals followed by<br/>an instrument demonstration and a repeat of verses 24-24<br/>where earlier verses are superimposed on each other.<br/>Most of the performers conducted or at least counted off sections,<br/>wearing headphones during the later sections to hear a click track.</p><p>It was an experience to walk into the hall and see all the instruments on<br/>stage. 6 harmonic cannons, 2 kithara, 2 surrogate kithara, cloud chamber<br/>bowls,<br/>2 chromelodeons, koto and so on. The stage was mighty crowded. :)</p><p>I hope there&apos;s more performances of Pedals in the future,<br/>I can&apos;t imagine that Newband would learn this only to perform<br/>it once.</p><p>*</p><p>BTW: 17 Lyrics of Li Po is being performed on<br/>10/6/2001 at Tonic, but I doubt I&apos;ll be able to attend.</p><p><a href="http://www.tonic107.com/">http://www.tonic107.com/</a></p><p>Harry Partch: 17 Lyrics of Li Po<br/>at 8:00pm, $10 Tzadik Festival<br/>The Seventeen Lyrics of Li Po was composed by the legendary Harry Partch<br/>between 1931 and 1933. Rarely performed live this is a unique opportunity<br/>to experience one of Partch&apos;s earliest extant compositions.
