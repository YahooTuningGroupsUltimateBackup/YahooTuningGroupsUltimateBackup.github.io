It is considered ideal in that<br/>it promotes what you call &quot;long term&quot; thinking.  It is my understanding that such meters are<br/>also common in the Mid East where not so much primes are used but other even rhythm. I mention<br/>these because when they are used, they are not subdivided into their simplest units. For<br/>instance, 21 is not divided into 7x3. One piece comes to mind in a long Prime rhythm is one<br/>that Kraig and I collected for the &quot;Interiors of Anaphoria CD&quot; Gending Boehme is in 79<br/>(subdivided 8-8-8-5-8-8-8-5-8-8-5). It flow quite naturally and once the pattern in heard ,<br/>one expects it to continue. Noticing that this is an MOS pattern, Kraig wrote a paper which<br/>you can find    <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/hora.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/hora.html</a> .<br/>    I know for a fact that Kraig has used 17 throughout his Film &quot;Mystery without Clews&quot;<br/>subdivided 5-3-4-3-2 and 19 in his opera &quot;War and Pieces subdivided 3-3-3-2-3-3-2. He has in<br/>conversation expressed that for quite a period of time he used such rhythms as a unifying<br/>device.<br/>    It is my understanding that rhythms of 13 were common in your neck of the woods, being<br/>used by the Vikings.<br/>    Augusto Navarro illustrates many ways in which higher harmonics can sound consonant as in<br/>32-37-42 each separated by &apos;5&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Mats &iuml;&iquest;&half;ljare&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&iuml;&iquest;&half;ve been wondering recently if there is a direct parallel between prime<br/>&gt; ratios in pitches and in rhythm.For most people,the sensation of consonance<br/>&gt; all but disappears at primes 17 and higher.Accompanied by a chord like just<br/>&gt; 1-3-5-7 for example,it blends in but by itself,17 and higher primes do not<br/>&gt; give the smooth sound lower primes has in most human ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While meters like 17 and 19 can be built up in the same way of shorter and<br/>&gt; longer sub-cycles,they simply refuse to&quot;flow&quot;in the way the previously<br/>&gt; mentioned meters does(a subjective experience.)</p><p>-- Banaphshu<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=11644 href="#11644">ðŸ”—</a>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@teleport.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2000 11:25:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>We&apos;re getting dangerously close to the work of Joseph Schillinger here :-).<br/>Sadly, his books are out of print and very hard to find.
