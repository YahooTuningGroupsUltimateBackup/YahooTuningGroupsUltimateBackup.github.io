The Terhardt quote in #32380:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Jeremy, do you have any problem with the following statement by<br/>Terhardt:</p><p>&apos;The affinity of tones has two main aspects. Firstly, there appears<br/>to exist an auditory &quot;sense&quot; for these two particular intervals.<br/>Experimental verification of that sense can be accomplished by<br/>presenting successive tone pairs to a listener and ask him to adjust<br/>one of the tone frequencies such that the tones are in an octave- or<br/>fifth-relationship, respectively. This is briefly termed octave- and<br/>fifth-matching of tones, respectively. As it turns out, most<br/>listeners are able to do this, and the result, on the average, is a<br/>frequency ratio which is close to 1:2 and 2:3, respectively. Octave-<br/>and fifth-matching can be done with practically any type of tone, in<br/>particular, both with harmonic complex tones and with sine tones.&apos; &gt;&gt;</p><p>Terhardt&apos;s language seems understandable in the quote above.</p><p>Regards,  J Gill</p></div>
