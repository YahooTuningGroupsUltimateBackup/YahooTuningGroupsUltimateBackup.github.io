Cameleon plays the tunings which have been loaded into each track of the plug-in.</p><p>I have put up 49 Cameleon microtunings (about 35 new ones) linked from by the Cameleon image at:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>They  can be downloaded in .zip or .sit formats, and include instructions etc.</p><p>Have fun! Experiment! Enjoy!</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a><br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div>
