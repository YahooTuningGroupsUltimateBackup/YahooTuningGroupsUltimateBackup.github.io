If you have<br/>issues over the way you think someone is behaving, send them a personal e-mail and<br/>present it in a calm and rational way, not with accusations and name calling.  You<br/>seem to be fairly reasonable people to me.  Like most of the people in this group (I<br/>think), I came here for learning, not academic sparring. Please, could you either<br/>resolve your differences without clogging up the tuning list or just forget them<br/>(personality clashes are going to happen).  It&apos;s not that these issues shouldn&apos;t be<br/>discussed, I think it&apos;s largely how.  No offense to anyone, and please, think happy<br/>thoughts.      -Eric</p></div>
