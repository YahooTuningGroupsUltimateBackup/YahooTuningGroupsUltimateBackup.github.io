The difference between them<br/>sounds to me much smaller, perhaps as if the tuner took &quot;quarter tone&quot;<br/>to mean &quot;quarter of a semitone&quot; - i.e. eighth tones.  I bet you can&apos;t<br/>hear from the Amazon sound samples because it takes a while for him to<br/>get into it.  It sounds way subtle.</p><p>I wonder what Corigliano wanted.</p><p>Reminds me also of &apos;Fantango&apos; for harpsichord by Jukka Tiensuu, with<br/>the two manuals a quartertone apart, but for which I have a recording<br/>in nothing but plain ol&apos; 12TET.  Booooooriiiiing, and a more<br/>open-and-shut case of subversion of intentions than with JSBach...</p><p>...scale of the week = chains of subminor thirds...</p></div><h3><a id=68869 href="#68869">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2007 9:18:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone heard this CD?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corigliano-Fantasy-Fantasia-Ostinato-">http://www.amazon.com/Corigliano-Fantasy-Fantasia-Ostinato-</a><br/>&gt; Chiaroscuro/dp/B000EUMKP4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The final piece, &quot;Chiaroscuro&quot;, is for two pianos tuned apart,<br/>&gt; so say the liner notes, by a quarter tone.</p><p>Is this the last three tracks?

What did you have in mind?</p><p>Oh, I don&apos;t have a specific design in mind; been messing with keyboard<br/>layouts that are mapped to chains of them (reduced to within an<br/>octave).  It&apos;s interesting that both 13-edo and 14-edo have subminor<br/>thirds of sorts.  But more on the purer 23, 31 side of the tree.  An<br/>interesting sound is the 4:5:6:7 tetrads moving by subminor thirds.<br/>Reminds me a lot of some of your music, possibly the 45000 fingers of<br/>Dr. S.</p><p>Having real trouble connecting my harmless abstract studies and<br/>meanderings to subtler &quot;real-music&quot; notions of counterpoint, melody,<br/>voice-leading, or at least my impressions of them...</p></div>
