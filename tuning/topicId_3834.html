But most hindi music at least uses what is called a 45/32 and bends around to that 7/5 which i<br/>recall was the hardest to tune on the hammerstrings while that 8/5 was a sinch. But I admit it took like two months to hear 7/5 as consonant in any context chords or melodic sequence. Hope this is&apos;nt too far off what you all are chatting about<br/>Pat</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;My friend is a trained classical musician, and his ear locates 8/5&apos;s in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;triads quicker than you can randomly change their roots while he listens.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What does that mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, if you play an 8:5:4 triad and then immediately play an 8:5 dyad, the dyad should sound more consonant than if played alone because the listener has already placed it in a harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I told my friend the same thing about the tempered tritone and the 8/5, except that he doesn&apos;t think the two are equally dissonant.  He hears all 8/5&apos;s as incomplete triads.  I told him that if he spent some time listening to and playing 7-limit harmono-melodic music, he might learn to recognize the 7/5 as a consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>&gt; More than 5,000!
