The following diagram shows the basic<br/>&quot;textbook&quot; form of Makam Sikah with a lower Sikah trichord,<br/>central Rast tetrachord, and upper Rast trichord. This last<br/>trichord, which leads up to the final of Sikah or its octave,<br/>sometimes takes an alternative form where the second note is<br/>subtly raised by a comma, so that it may serve as a leading tone<br/>pulling up by a smaller and more incisive step to the final.</p><p>         Sikah           Rast            Rast<br/>      |----------|------------------|------------|<br/>      0   127   334    542   704   831   1038  1200<br/>     1/1 14/13 40/33 160/117 3/2  21/13  51/28  2/1<br/>       127   207   209    162   127    207    162</p><p>                                    |------------|<br/>                                     Septimal Rast<br/>                                   831   1062  1200<br/>                                  21/13  24/13  2/1<br/>                                       231    138</p><p>One hallmark of an Ottoman style of intonation is the middle Rast<br/>tetrachord of 209-162-127 cents with its contrast between the<br/>large 162-cent and small 127-cent neutral second, respectively<br/>near 11:10 and 14:13, and the bright middle or neutral third at<br/>370 cents or a virtually just 26:21. A typical Arab Rast might be<br/>represented in this temperament as 209-150-138 cents, with the<br/>neutral third at around 16:13. Conversely, the opening Sikah<br/>trichord of 127-207 cents has a small neutral second step and a<br/>neutral third at 334 cents, notably lower than in another form<br/>available in the O3 system with steps at a rounded 138-207 cents<br/>(0-207-346 cents or ~1/1-9/8-11/9) more representative of a<br/>typical Arab shading.</p><p>In the &quot;regular&quot; form of our Ottoman-like Arab Sikah with a small<br/>127-cent Zalzalian step above the final and a large 162-cent step<br/>below it, the step above may act, a la Cameron Bobro, as a<br/>leading tone pulling _downward_ to the final, as in this<br/>three-voice cadence where the lowest voice descends by the small<br/>neutral step and each upper voice ascends by a large one.</p><p>          1038  (51/28)  1200 (2/1)<br/>           542 (117/60)   704 (3/2)<br/>           127  (14/13)    0  (1/1)</p><p>Here the first sonority at 0-416-912 cents, e.g. 1/1-14/11-22/13,<br/>has a regular major third and sixth which, as in 14th-century<br/>European counterpoint, expand to the fifth and octave -- but via<br/>Zalzalian melodic steps announcing a new style of polyphony which<br/>nicely fits the melodic structure of the maqam.</p><p>One tendency of Maqam Sikah (and also the related but distinct<br/>Turkish Maqam Segah, which we will also meet in this 12-note set)<br/>is sometimes to raise the step below the final, so that it may<br/>serve as a more incisive leading tone pulling up to the final. Here this step is subtly and gently raised by a comma from 1038<br/>to 162 cents, with the upper Rast trichord now taking the form of<br/>231-138 cents, or 0-231-359 cents -- around 1/1-8/7-16/13:</p><p>                            |------------|<br/>                             Septimal Rast<br/>                           831   1062  1200<br/>                          21/13  24/13  2/1<br/>                               231   138</p><p>Here the first step of the trichord is expanded from 207 to 231<br/>cents, or from 9:8 or 44:39 to 8:7, while the second step or<br/>upward leading tone to the final is subtly compressed from 162<br/>to 138 cents, or in superparticular terms from 11/10 to 13/12.</p><p>A cadence combining this upward leading tone of 138 cents with<br/>the downward one of 127 cents features a near-just 12:14:21<br/>sonority with a septimal minor third and seventh (7:6 and 7:4):</p><p>           831 21/13   704 3/2<br/>           127 14/13   704 3/2<br/>          -138 12/13    0  1/1</p><p>Makam Sikah takes its name from the Persian _segah_, referring to<br/>the &quot;third&quot; step, as does the related but distinct Turkish Maqam<br/>Segah. This &quot;third&quot; step defining the final of Sikah is that of<br/>the closely related Maqam Rast, &quot;the mother of all maqamat&quot; and<br/>the reference point for the maqam system, to which Maqam Sikah<br/>may often pleasantly modulate. The following diagram shows how<br/>Maqam Sikah and Maqam Rast in their basic &quot;textbook&quot; forms share<br/>the same steps of the gamut, with Sikah having its final on the<br/>step named &quot;sikah,&quot; and Rast -- not so surprisingly! -- on the<br/>step named &quot;rast.&quot; This diagram shows Arabic forms for the names<br/>of the steps, since we are hear addressing the Arab pattern for<br/>Maqam Sikah, with Turkish forms to follow shortly. The steps and<br/>intervals shown in the upper part of the diagram apply to Maqam<br/>Sikah, and those in the lower part to Maqam Rast.</p><p>        Rast        Sikah            Rast              Rast<br/>   |-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|<br/>     207   162   127    207     209     162  127    207      162<br/> 21/13  51/28 1/1  14/13   40/33  160/117 3/2  21/13    51/28     2/1<br/>  831   1038   0    127     334     542   704   831     1038     1200<br/>  rast dukah sikah jahargah nawa  huseyni awj  kirdan  muhayyer buzruk<br/>   0    207   369   496     703     912   1073  1200     207      369<br/>  1/1   9/8  26/21  4/3     3/2    22/13  13/7   2/1     9/8     26/21<br/>     207   162   127    207     209     162  127    207      162<br/>   |-----------------|.......|--------------------|----------------...<br/>          Rast         tone           Rast               Rast</p><p>The form of Rast on which we are here focusing, often regarded in<br/>modern times as the &quot;fundamental Arab scale,&quot; has two disjunct<br/>Rast tetrachords with a tone followed by a larger and smaller<br/>neutral second, and a middle tone around 9:8. Note how the<br/>central Rast tetrachord of Maqam Sikah coincides with the upper<br/>tetrachord of Maqam Rast.</p><p>When the step below the final of Sikah is raised by a comma in<br/>order to serve as a more incisive upward leading tone, from<br/>another perspective we have arrived at a septimal flavor or<br/>variation on a Rast tetrachord. This leading tone, dukah<br/>(i.e. the &quot;second&quot; step of Rast), is raised from around 9/8 to<br/>8/7, with the final sikah as the third step of the tetrachord,<br/>producing a pattern of a general kind described by Safi al-Din<br/>with steps of 8:7, 13:12, and 14:13.</p><p>    |-----------------------|<br/>    0      231     369     496<br/>   1/1     8/7    26/21    4/3<br/>   rast   dukah   sikah jahargah<br/>   21/13  24/13    1/1    14/13<br/>       231     138     127<br/>       8:7    13:12   14:13</p><p>As in Dudon&apos;s s-n-buzurg.scl, an advantage of having some steps a<br/>comma apart is that we can choose between nuances like the<br/>regular form of Rast or Sikah shown in the diagram above, or this<br/>septimal variation with dukah at 8/7 rather than 9/8 above rast.</p><p>Our second mode which stands out this rotation also invites such<br/>a comma nuance, as we shall see: an &quot;alternative&quot; form rather<br/>different from anything I know in Near Eastern practice, although<br/>closely related to it, which I call Penchgah al-Hagar or the<br/>Penchgah of Hagar in honor of the Matriarch Hagar, whose journey<br/>of exile and liberation in the desert with her son Ishmael is<br/>seen in the Jewish tradition as like that of the later Exodus,<br/>and likewise in the Islamic tradition as a germinal event.</p><p>Penchgah al-Hagar, while it takes its name from the Ottoman Maqam<br/>Penchgah, has a radically different intonational flavor closely<br/>related to that of Mustaqim al-Hagar, a form calling for a 4/3<br/>step not present in this rotation, but which we will meet in<br/>Rotation 8.</p><p>A usual Turkish Penchgah, which we will also shortly meet, calls<br/>for a high neutral third around 26/21 in this tuning -- or, in a<br/>common modern practice described by Ozan Yarman, a third at<br/>around 5/4, so that 26/21 might be called a &quot;low&quot; Penchgah.</p><p>In contrast, Penchgah al-Hagar, like the related Mustaqim<br/>al-Hagar, uses the _smallest_ Zalzalian or neutral intervals. Here is the basic form, with a notation added in which &quot;T&quot; shows<br/>a tone and &quot;J&quot; a mujannab or &quot;middle&quot; step somewhere between a<br/>usual semitone and usual tone, here a large or small neutral<br/>second:</p><p>              Penchgah                  Mustaqim<br/>    |----------------------------|---------------------|<br/>    0     207   334     542     704    912   1038    1200<br/>   1/1    9/8  40/33  160/117   3/2   22/13  51/28   2/1<br/>       207   127    207      162   207     127    162<br/>        T     J      T        J     T       J      J</p><p>Here it may be helpful to look first at the upper tetrachord of<br/>Mustaqim with its T-J-J structure: like a Rast tetrachord in<br/>having a tone followed by two neutral or middle second steps, but<br/>distinct in flavor because here the _smaller_ neutral second<br/>precedes the larger, 207-127-162 cents (or 0-207-334-496 cents).<br/>This contrasts dramatically with a Rast tetrachord having the<br/>same step sizes but a different order: 207-162-127 cents or<br/>0-207-369-496 cents, the bright Turkish Rast we met in our<br/>version of Maqam Sikah.</p><p>The lower Penchgah pentachord has a structure of T-J-T-J,<br/>starting like the upper Mustaqim tetrachord with steps of 207-127<br/>cents, but then interposing a tone, bringing us (as in Arab<br/>Sikah) to a step at a &quot;superfourth&quot; or small tritone above the<br/>final, here a notably narrow 542 cents, and followed by another<br/>neutral second to complete a perfect fifth.</p><p>For me, the small neutral third of the lower pentachord invites a<br/>consideration of Hagar&apos;s exile, while the upper tetrachord, which<br/>also occurs as a tetrchord below the final and leading up to it,<br/>may have a more joyful and even ecstatic quality, celebrating the<br/>richness and depth of her spiritual journey.</p><p>In Mustaqim al-Hagar, as will be discussed, and also in Penchgah<br/>al-Hagar, it is my custom at some point in the seyir to include a Hijaz tetrachord in some form, which traditionally is<br/>associated with the vastness of the desert, and thus fitly<br/>commemorates the Matriarch Hagar&apos;s ordeal of exile, or Exodus.<br/>In the Turkish tradition, interestingly, one form of Hijaz is<br/>much like our medieval Buzurg, with lower and upper steps around<br/>14;13 or 13:12, and a middle step around 8:7. Happily our tuning<br/>in this rotation supplies such a form:</p><p>              Penchgah                Hijaz (Buzurg)<br/>    |----------------------------|---------------------|<br/>    0     207   334     542     704    831   1062    1200<br/>   1/1    9/8  40/33  160/117   3/2   21/13  24/13   2/1<br/>       207   127    207      162   127    231    138<br/>        T     J      T        J     J      A      J</p><p>Here in addition to tone (T) and mujannab (J) steps, we have an<br/>8:7 step identified more generically as an &quot;augmented&quot; step (A)<br/>somwhat larger than a usual tone. This middle &quot;augmented&quot; step<br/>is here what the Lebanese musician Amine Beyhom calls &quot;slightly&quot;<br/>augmented at 8:7 or so, while in other forms of Hijaz it is<br/>wider, for example at around 7:6 or 13:11.</p><p>Following the seyir or procedure for Penchgah al-Hagar, we may<br/>alternate between this Hijaz/Buzurg form of the upper tetrachord<br/>and the regular form at 127-207-162 cents, with a possible nuance<br/>of sometimes ascending to the final with the higher 24/13 step<br/>and then descending with the usual 51/28 step at a comma lower.</p><p>Using the lower form of this step at around 51/28, we can form a<br/>characteristic cadence featuring a vertical large neutral or<br/>submajor third at around 26:21.</p><p>   542   160/117  704  3/2<br/>   207     9/8     0   1/1<br/>  -162    51/56    0   1/1</p><p>In this stately cadence, the outer voices ascend by 162-cent<br/>steps, large enough to be heard almost as whole tones, while the<br/>middle voice descends by a regular tone around 9:8 or 44:39.</p><p>Both our Makam Sikah with an Ottoman flavor of intonation, and<br/>Penchgah al-Hagar, borrow some familiar Near Eastern patterns but<br/>modify them to arrive at modes a bit off the &quot;beaten track.&quot; They<br/>should be used and enjoyed as variations on, rather than<br/>exemplars of, usual Arab or Turkish maqam music.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>Rotation 2 (44/39): A conjunct &quot;Shur,&quot; sans 3/2<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>0 57.4 138.3 264.8 473.4 496.9 635.2 761.7 842.6 969.1 992.6 1130.9 2/1</p><p>For someone trained in a classic medieval or Renaissance European<br/>perspective, it is easy to come upon a scale rotation without a 3/2<br/>and conclude that since no proper &quot;modes&quot; are available from such<br/>a perspective, one might as well proceed to the next rotation. In<br/>a Near Eastern tradition, however, beautiful modes are available<br/>which do not use a perfect fifth above the final, so I shall<br/>resolutely resist this classic European temptation and consider<br/>each rotation.</p><p>So considered, this rotation offers the treasure of a variation<br/>on Shur Dastgah with _conjunct_ Shur tetrachords actually<br/>following a pattern often favored by the gushe-s or melodic themes<br/>making up this dastgah or modal family, where the fifth is<br/>lowered by about a third of a tone from its &quot;textbook&quot; position<br/>at 3/2. Here is a symmetrical form of this pattern, very<br/>interesting to explore as an independent mode, with a possible<br/>Persian style of note spelling shown:</p><p>                   Shur                Shur         tone<br/>           |-------------------|------------------|.......|<br/>           0    138    265    497   635   762    993    1200<br/>          1/1  13/12   7/6    4/3  13/9   14/9   16/9    2/1<br/>           D     Ep     F      G     Ap    Bb      C      D<br/>             138    127   232    138    127   231    207</p><p>The Persian koron sign (ASCII &quot;p&quot;) shows the lowering of a note<br/>by about a third of a tone, an amount that varies somewhat<br/>depending on the context and the musician&apos;s taste. The conjunct<br/>Shur tetrachords follow Ibn Sina&apos;s 11th-century description of a<br/>tuning with steps of 13:12-14:13-8:7, here 12:13:14:16, with the<br/>larger 13:12 neutral step placed below the smaller 14:13, and<br/>then the wide 8:7 tone to complete the fourth.</p><p>This modal form might also represent a septimal form of the Arab<br/>Maqam Bayyatayn, with two conjunct Bayyati tetrachords which,<br/>like the Persian Shur tetrachord, have two neutral second steps<br/>followed by a tone. While the Arab Bayyati family often favors a<br/>minor third at around the Pythagorean 32/27 or 294 cents, as<br/>reported by Scott Marcus of Egyptian practice, he notes that some<br/>Arab musicians favor a distinctly lower minor third; if the<br/>difference is sometimes around a comma, then 7/6 could represent<br/>one shade of this interpretation.</p><p>One could also introduce as comma variations the 21/16 and 7/4<br/>steps available in this rotation.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>Rotation 3 (7/6): A &quot;mirror image&quot; Slendro and Maqam Najdi<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>0 80.9 207.4 416.0 439.5 577.7 704.3 785.2 911.7 935.2 1073.4 1142.6 2/1</p><p>Keeping in mind the gamelan aspects of this scale, we should note<br/>the availability of a version in original position of Jacques<br/>Dudon&apos;s M (or Mi) type of septimal slendro, the &quot;Mirror Image&quot;<br/>variety with steps, here tempered, of 1/1-9/8-9/7-3/2-12/7-2/1,<br/>or 9:8-8:7-7:6-8:7-7:6.</p><p>    0      207     439     704      935    1200<br/>   1/1     9/8     9/7     3/2     12/7     2/1<br/>       207     232     265     231      265</p><p>This rotation makes possible a rather less familiar Arab maqam<br/>sometimes called Najdi which, however, as Ozan Yarman has noted,<br/>is really a close relative of the Turkish Penchgah mentioned and<br/>promised earlier -- here featuring a characteristic Ottoman<br/>flavor of intonation, although not the most commonly cited in<br/>modern practice. In its most regular form, our Najdi is as<br/>follows:</p><p>            Najdi                  Rast<br/> |-------------------------|-------------------|<br/> 0     207   416    578   704    912   1073  1200 1/1    9/8  14/11  88/63  3/2   22/13  13/7   2/1<br/>   207    209   162    127   207    162    127<br/>    T      T     J      J     T      J      J<br/> |......|------------------|-------------------|<br/>   tone         Rast               Rast</p><p>From one perspective Najdi, like a Turkish Penchgah, consists of<br/>a lower pentachord with a tritonic step (here 578 cents, around<br/>88/63) pulling up to 3/2, and then an upper Rast tetrachord. In<br/>another view, we may also analyze this maqam as a _lower_ tone<br/>around 9/8 plus two conjunct upper Rast tetrachords of T J J<br/>(here a characteristically Ottoman 209-162-127 cents).</p><p>A variation is also possible favoring a septimal flavor for the<br/>two conjunct Rast tetrachords, with the &quot;A&quot; notation showing the<br/>8/7 as Beyhom&apos;s &quot;slightly&quot; augmented major second:</p><p>            Najdi                  Rast<br/> |-------------------------|-------------------|<br/> 0     207   439    578   704    935   1073  1200 1/1    9/8   9/7   88/63  3/2   12/7   13/7   2/1<br/>   207    232   138    127   231    138    127<br/>    T      A     J      J     A      J      J<br/> |......|------------------|-------------------|<br/>   tone         Rast               Rast</p><p>Either form offers a very attractive three-voice cadence with a<br/>large 26/21 neutral third at 370 cents expanding to a fifth and a<br/>large neutral sixth at 866 cents or around 33/20 expanding to an<br/>octave:</p><p>         1073  13/7     1200  2/1<br/>          578  88/63     704  3/2<br/>          207   9/8       0   1/1</p><p>Another version of this cadence has a near-14:17:21 sonority on<br/>the step below the final resolving to a fifth on the final:</p><p>          578 88/63   704 3/2<br/>          207  9/8    704 3/2<br/>         -127 13/7     0  1/1</p><p>(Conclusion of Part 2)</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
