Del<br/>Linenberger is also helping out in digestification. I had encountered a<br/>red herring where <a href="http://ella.mills.edu">ella.mills.edu</a> refused to service digest requests, but<br/><a href="http://eartha.mills.edu">eartha.mills.edu</a> was happy to provide them - silly me.</p><p>At the moment, I have the digests organised in groups of 100 as NeXT<br/>mailboxes, which is completely useless to the majority of the tuning<br/>community (until MacOsX). I have several scripts which can be used to<br/>convert them to more usable formats which are searchable for the rest of<br/>the world.</p><p>The best place for these should be the &quot;son/daughter of ella&quot; ftp/http<br/>site, assuming there are no options to add web serving to ella. There<br/>should probably be the option of downloading the full archive or<br/>searching it via the web.<br/>---<br/>Leigh Smith      <a href="mailto:leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au">leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au</a> (NeXTMail/MIME)<br/>                   +61-8-9380-2279 Fax: 9380-1089 Home: 9386-2994<br/>Computer Music Lab, Computer Science Dept, University of Western Australia<br/>Y2K Problem - The COBOL Programmers Superannuation Fund</p></div>
