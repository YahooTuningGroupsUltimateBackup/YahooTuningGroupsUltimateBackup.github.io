I thought this<br/>might be a feasible way of adapting his ideas using conventional controllers.  Right now I&apos;ve got every 8ve as one row of the<br/>diamond, so playing from C up to B gives the otonal identities while playing the keyboard 8ves results in the utonal<br/>counterparts.</p><p>Has anyone else had success using this method?  Even if you&apos;ve never thought about it, what are your thoughts?</p><p>-Chris B.</p></div>
