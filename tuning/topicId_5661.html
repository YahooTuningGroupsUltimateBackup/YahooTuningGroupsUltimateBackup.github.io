I was intending to write<br/>one for David Beardsley&apos;s _Juxtaposition_ ezine, but I&apos;ve<br/>been busy and haven&apos;t done it yet.  Here&apos;s a quickie:</p><p>(of course both the efforts in and the results of the<br/>concert merit far more attention than I&apos;m giving here...)</p><p>My favorite piece on the whole concert was the second piece,<br/>Luc Marcel&apos;s _Mod&apos;ele 312_, and a close second was the<br/>closing number, Charles Ives&apos;s _Unanswered Question_<br/>performed in an extended Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>The concert opened with _Hologram_ for Orchestra, by<br/>Alyssa Ryvers, who is from Toronto and Nova Scotia.<br/>The program notes betray a stong mystical streak in<br/>her work.  Niether the piece nor the performance<br/>impressed me strongly enough for me to retain a memory<br/>of it to write about at this late date, which is certainly<br/>also partly my fault, but in fairness to the composer and<br/>performers, I should also say that perhaps I need more hearings<br/>of this piece to appreciate it.</p><p>Next was Marcel&apos;s piece.  Marcel is a young composer from<br/>Montreal.  The orchestra&apos;s playing was at its most polished<br/>on this piece, and it dazzled in a way that *did* impress<br/>itself on my memory.  Lots of antiphonal dove-tailing of parts<br/>from, for example, penny-whistle in the percussion section<br/>at the left rear to flutes at the right front.  The<br/>compositional gestures were all clearly delineated and<br/>the performance had some drama to it.  Very nice.</p><p>Closing the first half was Mordecai Sandberg&apos;s _Psalm 51 #2_<br/>for Soprano and Orchestra.  Dorien Verheijden was the<br/>soloist, and she gave an expressive performance, which<br/>unfortunately was sometimes swamped a little by the volume<br/>of the orchestra.  The orchestra performed ably, in the<br/>face of Sandberg&apos;s horrendously difficult polymicrotonal<br/>tunings.  I&apos;d like to say more about this piece, but so<br/>far neither of the Sandberg pieces I&apos;ve heard (the other<br/>was a violin sonata at the 1997 AFMM) have really moved me,<br/>so I&apos;ll just withhold further comment for now.</p><p>The second half of the concert opened with Jon Catler&apos;s<br/>_Evolution_ for Electric Guitar and Orchestra.  I&apos;ve been<br/>a big fan of Jon&apos;s work for a few years now, and what I<br/>liked most in this piece was the moments when the body of<br/>strings in unison/&apos;octaves&apos; followed his extended guitar riffs,<br/>doing quite well at hitting those difficult 13-limit intervals<br/>right on the money.  Another thing that I enjoyed in this<br/>performance was something that also happened for Marcel&apos;s<br/>piece: a sense of excitement in some places.</p><p>The second piece on part two was Johnny Reinhard&apos;s<br/>_Middle-earth_ Symphony.  IMO, the most successful movement<br/>was the first, which portrayed &apos;Hobbits&apos;: the clowning<br/>musical antics, especially in the bassoon parts, really<br/>brought Tolkien&apos;s loveable characters to my mind.<br/>The other three movments portrayed &apos;Khaza&apos;d&apos; (dwarves),<br/>&apos;Mordor&apos; (trolls and orcs), and &apos;Eldarin&apos; (high elves).<br/>The last movement was especially pretty.  Something I&apos;m<br/>hearing more and more in Johnny&apos;s music is a great<br/>facility in capturing the dramatic essence of a musical<br/>motive or characterization with a particular tuning,<br/>his polymicrotonal compositions displaying a kaleidescopic<br/>pool of tunings all delineating particular programmatic<br/>ideas.</p><p>And closing the concert was Charles Ives&apos;s _Unanswered<br/>Question_ (1908 alternate version) performed in extended<br/>Pythagorian tuning.  As explained in the program, this<br/>alternate version has &apos;the english horn, played here<br/>by Derek Floyd, rather than the familiar trumpet. Likewise,<br/>the woodwidn choir is more diverse.&apos;  The strings, which<br/>I&apos;ve always heard from offstage, as indicated in the score,<br/>were here played on-stage with the other instruments.<br/>Floyd was terrific in the lead role, and the soft velvety<br/>sound of the English horn was a nice change from the trumpet.<br/>But the strings were the real stand-out in this piece,<br/>their quiet eerie calm never budging despite all the<br/>bizarre intrusions from the winds.  It was beautiful,<br/>and to my ears, it never sounded this good before, without<br/>the careful attention to tuning that the AFMM ensemble<br/>displayed.</p><p>The conductor was Paolo Bellomia, who now lives in Ottawa.<br/>Patrick Grant was in charge of sound (he also played one<br/>of the keyboard parts in the Sandberg).</p><p>Another highlight of the evening for me personally was that<br/>I finally got to meet La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela,<br/>who were in the audience.  About 20 of us had a nice dinner<br/>after the show.</p><p>Oh well, I guess that turned out long enough for _Juxtaposition_<br/>after all... you can use this, Dave.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

OK, I was there, I&apos;ll review it:</p><p>Review of American Festival of Microtonal Music Columbus Day 1999 Orchestra<br/>Concert.</p><p>Over all, a very enjoyable show.  The building was beautiful, acoustics<br/>excellent, pews uncomfortable.  I love hearing premiere performances where<br/>the composer is present.</p><p>Hologram for Orchestra (premiere) by Alyssa Ryvers</p><p>This piece opened with a minute of solo flute.  She was then joined by<br/>another flautist playing a microtonal variation on the melody.  The rest of<br/>the orchestra joined in canonically and the piece rapidly went from simple<br/>pure melody to an intricate microtonal dissonance.  I am sure this squirming<br/>mass of microtones had something to do with permutations of the original<br/>melody, but I couldn&apos;t tell you what.</p><p>Modele 312 (premiere) by Luc Marcel</p><p>This piece combined dissonant microtonal orchestral squirming with<br/>Varese-like percussion.  The two seemed to battle for supremacy, but the<br/>percussion, being louder, won.  I would have liked to hear the strings<br/>better because they sure were working hard.</p><p>In one of these first two pieces (I can&apos;t remember which) There was a really<br/>nice point where the female percussionist played a slide whistle duet with<br/>the flute.  Also, they had this great big rectangular section of industrial<br/>air duct for her to beat on.  It rattled and buzzed and boomed all at the<br/>same time!</p><p>Psalm 51 #2 for Soprano and Orchestra (1944) Mordecai Sandberg</p><p>This piece came with pages of explanation, and more pages of lyrics.  There<br/>were parts for two microtonal keyboards who played all the microtones in the<br/>work.  The keyboards had DX7 type piano patches loaded and were practically<br/>inaudible.  Musically it sounded like a study on a single texture.</p><p>Intermission.  I got to meet Joe Monzo, Leigh Smith.  I already knew David<br/>Beardsley, but I saw him again too.  Back to my seat up front for the second<br/>half:</p><p>Evolution for Electric Guitar and Orchestra (premiere) Jon Catler</p><p>I confess, hearing the guitar I fretted was the main thing that drew me to<br/>the event.  I was not disappointed.  Catler&apos;s piece began with a series of<br/>beautiful microtonal consonances - something often overlooked in microtonal<br/>works.  The piece consisted of multiple texture changes: One minute, the<br/>strings playing a consonant chord, the next the electric guitar tearing<br/>through with a rough dissonance.  Then the guitar would move to a consonance<br/>and a voice would take the lead ushering in a calmer texture.  Then a tutti<br/>for a fast mid-eastern sounding microtonal melody.  I could have listened to<br/>an hour long version, but it only lasted about 15 minutes.  I should note<br/>that the string section had mixed reactions to playing with an electric<br/>guitar.  One of the violinists sitting about 12 feet from the amplifier wore<br/>earplugs.  Other players beamed when the distorted guitar threatened to<br/>drown them out.  Catler&apos;s guitar was the only fixed pitch microtonal<br/>instrument I saw all evening.  It sure looked nice though.  (If I do say so<br/>myself!)</p><p>Middle-earth for Orchestra (premiere)  Johnny Reinhard</p><p>There was some very nice percussion writing which evoked thoughts of dwarves<br/>smelting iron.  The curled horn of some slain beast briefly rose above a sea<br/>of microtonal dissonance in one movement.  What a tone!  I wished the<br/>performer had stood up to play it.  There was also a brief moment of very<br/>inspired bassoon writing that could have held my interest for a good 30<br/>minutes.  I did think about Tolkein during the pieces, but the elf piece<br/>reminded me more of dwarves.</p><p>Unanswered Question (1908 alternate version) Charles Ives</p><p>This piece sounded a bit unanswered, disjointed maybe, but beautiful.  The<br/>flutes made a scandalous break with tradition, and conducted themselves<br/>while the conductor led the rest of the orchestra.  I didn&apos;t hear much in<br/>the way of microtones, except that the string section&apos;s unison at the<br/>beginning and end sounded slightly out of tune.  Ives had the best sense of<br/>the piece as a whole of all the pieces played that night.  He wrote great<br/>parts, but excelled at controlling the overall textures and directions of<br/>the piece.  Obviously a great piece with more to it than a single listening<br/>could discover.</p><p>I want to say thank you to Johnny Reinhard for putting this on.  It&apos;s no<br/>small task to organize an event of this size.  I want to encourage everyone<br/>involved to keep writing and/or keep playing.  And I want to thank those who<br/>wrote and played.  I really hope this festival continues - and grows!  The<br/>world needs more of this kind of thing!</p><p>All in all, worth the 9 hours of driving and night on a friend&apos;s floor.  I<br/>plan to go next year.  It inspired me to try to write or perform something<br/>in the future.  Nothing beats new works by living composers - especially<br/>microtonal ones!</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div>
