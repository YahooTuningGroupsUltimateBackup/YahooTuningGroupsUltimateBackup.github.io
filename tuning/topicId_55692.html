I&apos;ve been thinking about how to predict these very values, and yesterday the<br/>pattern dawned on me.

That much, anyway.</p><p>&gt; Maybe there are interesting things going on at the boundaries,</p><p>At the boundaries the L steps are devouring the s steps.  So between 700cents and<br/>720 cents you have 5L+7s, but as you near 720 the L&apos;s are so big that they just want<br/>to eat those little s&apos;s.  Yep.  You get the &quot;superpythagorean&quot; system, and then beyond.</p><p>Fun stuff!<br/>Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=55694 href="#55694">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2004 2:13:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It seems that under certain conditions, the region between two<br/>intervals of value<br/>&gt; 2^(a/b) and 2^(c/d) [in your perfect-fifth case, 3/5 and 4/7] will<br/>always have a MOS<br/>&gt; of size b+d!

If you take the 12th row of<br/>the Farey seqence, previous to 7/12 we get 4/7, and after it 3/5, so<br/>there is a 4/7 &lt; 7/12 &lt; 3/5 in it.</p><p>From a boundry point of view, if n is the denominator it isn&apos;t just n<br/>which is important, but also 2n; if you take the 24th row of the Farey<br/>sequence, you get 11/19 &lt; 7/12 &lt; 10/17. Between 11/19 and 7/12 we may<br/>take the fifth to be meantone, and between 7/12 and 10/17 to be (a<br/>rather broadly defined) schismic. 3/5 can&apos;t be taken as a lower<br/>boundry for superpyth, but it makes a reasonable upper boundry; the<br/>22nd row of the Farey sequence contains 10/17 &lt; 13/22 &lt; 3/5, and this<br/>could be taken as the superpyth range, though the flatter side of it<br/>might be a temperament which isn&apos;t very good with commas 2240/2187 and<br/>6144/6125. The true superpyth range can be considered<br/>13/22 &lt; 42/71 &lt; 29/49 &lt; 16/27, where 42/71 is &quot;copop&quot;; optimal in some<br/>sense in both the 7 and 9 limits.</p></div>
