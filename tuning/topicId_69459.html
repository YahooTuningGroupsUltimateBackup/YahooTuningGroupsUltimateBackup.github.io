My name is Chris DesMarais.  I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve posted publicly to this<br/>group since I joined early last August, though I receive and review the daily digest,<br/>learning all sorts of interesting things (a recent reference sent me off around the Web<br/>researching Coral Castle, for example), and I&apos;ve been in touch with some of you privately<br/>by e-mail.  I was actually hoping to delay this introduction until I had more to present, but<br/>some things are going more quickly than expected, and others are going more slowly.<br/>Such is life.</p><p>Anyway, I have a point, and it is this:  I&apos;m involved in a nascent music community seeking<br/>to establish various ongoing projects, one of which is a free-for-download quarterly<br/>publication (which we will probably also offer as a print version through CafePress, for the<br/>hell of it).  This community is focused on the frontiers of music.  Some of our recent<br/>endeavors involve generative music, microtonality, circuit bending, found-object<br/>instrument construction, and improvisational composition techniques.  (A more detailed<br/>description, as well as a name for the community, will be presented once we actually get<br/>the website up and running.)</p><p>I&apos;ve come to ask whether anyone in this group might be interested in participating.  I&apos;m<br/>looking for any of the following:</p><p>- Article contributions for the quarterly publication.  Sample subjects:  interviews, featured<br/>tunings, custom instruments, historical instruments, composition techniques, synthesizer<br/>programming, music lessons, etc.  For those planning to attend the next UK Microfest, or<br/>NIME, or any similar sort of convention, reports from these are also definitely welcome.</p><p>- Recordings to be offered free for download.  Excerpts may appear in a podcast as well.</p><p>- Website work.  We&apos;re looking at including project pages, a forum, a wiki, possibly java<br/>chat, whatever might be useful.</p><p>- Cross-platform, open-source software development.</p><p>- Donations of pretty much anything, including any of the above as well as hosting<br/>service, actual instruments or gear, money, etc.  (I&apos;m not holding out much hope for this<br/>one yet, but hey, I figured I&apos;d ask.)</p><p>More information will be coming as soon as I&apos;m able to give it.  In the mean time, I&apos;m<br/>anxious to hear from any of you.  We don&apos;t have much beyond passion at this point, and<br/>we&apos;re hoping you can help us make it more than that.  Plus, you&apos;ll be able to say you were<br/>there when it all began!   :-)</p></div><h3><a id=69461 href="#69461">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2007 9:43:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;callahanwhite&quot; &lt;cortaigne@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello, everyone!
