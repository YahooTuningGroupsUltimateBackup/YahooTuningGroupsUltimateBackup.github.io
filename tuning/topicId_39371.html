These two small ratios add up to 896:891, the<br/>amount by which a 14:11 third exceeds an 81:64 Pythagorean third<br/>formed from four pure 3:2 fifths (~407.820 cents).</p><p>In effect, we have divided the 896:891 comma or kleisma into two<br/>almost equal parts of 352:351 and 364:363. Thus the whole-tone steps<br/>of C-D and D-E are almost identical in size at 44:39 and 273:243,<br/>differing only by the harmonisma of 10648:10647 or about 0.163 cents.<br/>These whole-tones are formed from one pure and one wide fifth.</p><p>This &quot;quasi-bisection&quot; of the 896:891 results also in some variations<br/>of sizes for major sixths or minor thirds, formed from chains of three<br/>fifths up or down.</p><p>In our chain above, the major sixth C-A is formed from two pure fifths<br/>plus G-D at 352:351 wide, producing a size of 22:13 -- or a minor<br/>third A-C of 13:11 (~289.210 cents).</p><p>The major sixth G-E, however, is formed from one pure fifth and the<br/>two virtually tempered fifths G-D at 352:351 wide and A-E at 364:363,<br/>making larger than Pythagorean (27:16, ~905.865 cents) by a full<br/>896:891, at 56:33, or a minor third E-G at 33:28 (~284.447 cents), the<br/>fifth&apos;s complement of 14:11.</p><p>Additional varieties of thirds and sixths arise at other points in the<br/>diatonic chain of fifths, for example:</p><p>                             +352:351<br/>                             (+4.925)<br/>    |-------------------- 33:26 (412.745) -----------------|<br/>                  |------------- 22:13 (910.628) ----------|<br/>    |------------- 22:13 (910.628) ----------|<br/>    |------- 9:8 (203.910) -----|---- 273:242 (208.763) ---|<br/>    F ----------- C ----------- G ---------- D ----------- A<br/>          3:2           3:2         273:242        3:2<br/>        701.955       701.955       706.880      701.955<br/>          pure          pure       +352:351        pure<br/>                                   (+4.763)</p><p>Here the chain for the major third F-A consists of three pure fifths,<br/>plus one fifth (G-D) at 352:351 wide, producing a size of 33:26, or<br/>about 412.745 cents, the fifth&apos;s complement of 13:11.</p><p>Here we have the 9:8 major third F-G plus G-A at 273:242, together<br/>making up 33:26. The major sixths F-D and C-A both consist of two pure<br/>fifths, plus the wide G-D, and thus have sizes of 22:13, or 352:351<br/>wider than the Pythagorean 27:16 (with C-A also appearing in the<br/>previous example).</p><p>Another size of major sixth or minor third appears in the chain<br/>forming the major third G-B:</p><p>                             +896:891<br/>                             (+9.688)<br/>    |-------------------- 14:11 (417.508) -----------------|<br/>                  |------------ 819:484 (915.553) ---------|<br/>    |-------------- 56:33 (915.553) ---------|<br/>    |------ 44:39 (208.835) ----|---- 273:243 (208.673) ---|<br/>    G ----------- D ----------- A ---------- E ----------- B<br/>        176:117         3:2         182:121        3:2<br/>        706.880       701.955       706.718      701.955<br/>       +352:351        pure        +364:363        pure<br/>       (+4.925)                    (+4.763)</p><p>Here, as in the first chain of C-E, there are two pure and two<br/>virtually tempered fifths forming a 14:11 major third. Likewise, there<br/>are two whole-tones making a near-equal division of the 896:891 comma<br/>into 352:351 (G-A) and 364:363 (A-B), with sizes larger than 9:8 by<br/>these amounts.</p><p>As with the chain C-E, the chain G-B has the 56:33 major sixth G-E<br/>made up of one pure and two wide fifths, again together accounting for<br/>the full comma or kleisma of 896:891.</p><p>However, the major sixth D-B differs minutely from the 22:13 sixths in<br/>our previous examples: it is made up of two pure fifths plus the fifth<br/>A-E at 364:363 wide, or 819:484 (~910.628), while 22:13 (e.g C-A in<br/>the first example) is formed from two pure fifths plus one fifth wide<br/>by 352:351. Similarly, we have minutely differing minor thirds at<br/>13:11 (e.g. A-C) and 968:819 (~289.372 cents).</p><p>This is another illustration of the distinction of the harmonisma at<br/>10648:10647.</p><p>Having considered these ratios as they shape the patterns of virtual<br/>temperaments, let us consider the compromises involved from a more<br/>general philosophical viewpoint.</p><p>An important factor in &quot;just temperament&quot; is the relatively small size<br/>of the 896:891 comma or undecimal kleisma involved in obtaining pure<br/>14:11 major thirds, as opposed to the larger commas for 9:7 (64:63) or<br/>5:4 (81:80).</p><p>Happily, the 896:891 divides conveniently into almost equal parts of<br/>352:351 (the tredecimal kleisma involved in obtaining a pure 13:11)<br/>and 364:363 (the 11-13 schisma by which 13:11 differs from 33:28).</p><p>Thus just temperament mixes pure fifths with others about as impure as<br/>in meantone or George Secor&apos;s 17-note well-temperament in its nearer<br/>portion of Ab-B, and produces a delightful mixture of thirds at 14:11,<br/>13:11, 33:26, 33:28 -- and also 968:819 (almost identical to 13:11).</p><p>Just temperament contrasts with two more familiar arrangements for<br/>obtaining fifths at or near 3:2, and 14:11 thirds:</p><p>    Usual just intonation:</p><p>                          14:11 (417.508)<br/>    |------------------------------------------------------|<br/>    |----- 112:99 (213.598) ----|----- 9:8 (203.910) ------|<br/>    G ----------- D ----------- A ---------- E ----------- B<br/>          3:2         448:297         3:2          3:2<br/>        701.955       711.643       701.955      701.955<br/>          pure       +896:891         pure         pure<br/>                      +9.688</p><p>    Usual eventone temperament:</p><p>                          14:11 (417.508)<br/>    |------------------------------------------------------|<br/>    |----- 209.254 (+ 4.844) ---|---- 209.254 (+4.844) ----|<br/>    G ----------- D ----------- A ---------- E ----------- B<br/>        704.377       704.377       704.377      704.377<br/>         +2.422        +2.422        +2.422       +2.422</p><p>In conventional just intonation, as many fifths as possible are made<br/>pure, so that a 14:11 third is formed by three such fifths plus a<br/>fifth wide by the full 896:891, or about 9.688 cents. Such a fifth,<br/>although not quite an outright &quot;Wolf&quot; by traditional European<br/>compositional standards, is nevertheless quite rough, especially in<br/>contrast to the pure fifths of the tuning, and in likely styles where<br/>fifths and fourths are the main stable concords.</p><p>In a conventional regular or eventone tuning, all fifths are tempered<br/>by 1/4 of the 896:891 comma or kleisma, or about 2.422 cents, a<br/>compromise considerably milder than in meantone, and slightly greater<br/>than in 12n-tone equal temperament (fifths at 700 cents, ~1.955 cents<br/>narrow).</p><p>The delight of just temperament is its mixture of pure and moderately<br/>impure fifths, producing a subtle variety of thirds and sixths, and<br/>also the intellectual charms of the 10648:10647.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=39373 href="#39373">ðŸ”—</a>M.
