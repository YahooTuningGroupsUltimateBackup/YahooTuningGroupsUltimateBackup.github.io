So far, I am not aware of any<br/>&gt; evidence of this.</p><p>As I will emphasize below, your perspective has a long and honored<br/>history, going back at least to Gioseffo Zarlino, who resisted the use<br/>of quantities, niceties, or visual designs in music which have no<br/>apparent audible consequences. From such a philosophical viewpoint,<br/>one _can_ very reasonably read an implicit claim into the use of large<br/>primes, or other integers, that they are intended to have special<br/>auditory significance.</p><p>From my own medievalist perspective, numbers could be used in tunings<br/>or otherwise in the construction of a piece or music without any<br/>actual or implicit claim to &quot;psychoacoustical significance&quot; or an<br/>&quot;audibly discrete&quot; character.</p><p>Otherwise I might find myself concluding that Baude Cordier was<br/>claiming special &quot;psychoacoustical significance&quot; for his compositions<br/>notated in the form of a compass or a heart -- two beautiful<br/>compositions, by the way, where the visual design is emblematic of the<br/>text.</p><p>Similarly, I might conclude that Josquin was claiming a special<br/>&quot;psychoacoustical significance&quot; when using the solmization syllables<br/>from the name of Duke Hercules of Ferrara, or from the phrase &quot;Vive le<br/>roy!&quot; to write masterful pieces, a Mass and a fanfare.</p><p>The use of large prime numbers in tunings seems to me to admit of a<br/>similar kind of technique: picking emblematic or otherwise attractive<br/>numbers, and building a tuning on them. Of course, I would look at the<br/>values in cents to see what the likely effect might be -- with<br/>performance in an actual timbre (another variable) confirming,<br/>denying, or modifying such an estimation.</p><p>When someone like Jacky Ligon or Robert Walker finds interesting<br/>mathematical patterns in musically-applied primes, then I would<br/>certainly agree that we can and should ask whether such patterns might<br/>have any special significance, or might be explained by some more<br/>general mathematical principles, as Paul Erlich has done most<br/>skillfully in one very recent instance.</p><p>However, the use of a ratio in itself seems to me a matter of art --<br/>be it emblematic, purely arbitrary (&quot;I like the number, or intuit that<br/>somehow it may produce an interesting result&quot;), or done in a carefully<br/>calculated &quot;psychoacoustical&quot; way. A fine point: one can pick numbers<br/>in a &quot;random&quot; kind of way, but then select those that happen to<br/>produce an interesting value in cents for the musical purpose at hand.</p><p>While celebrating the emblematic or other artistically arbitrary use<br/>of numbers in music -- as opposed to in an acoustical or other<br/>scientific experiments, where quantities should indeed be explicable<br/>and significant to the design of the experiment -- I would like to<br/>join in due skepticism concerning claims for the &quot;superiority&quot; of<br/>certain tunings, whether defined with familiar mathematical quantities<br/>or otherwise.</p><p>For example, while Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone has the intriguing<br/>property of symmetrical Golden Ratios between various classes of<br/>intervals, and the Noble Fifth tuning curiously has a supraminor sixth<br/>very closely approximating an interval ratio of Phi itself, I would be<br/>cautious about claiming any distinctive acoustical properties for<br/>either tuning not shared by others in the same general regions of the<br/>continuum. Other meantones between 1/4-comma and 2/7-comma, or<br/>neo-Gothic tunings with fifths around 704 cents, may have essentially<br/>similar acoustical qualities (in slightly different shadings, of<br/>course).</p><p>Similarly, as myself an enthusiast and promoter of the &quot;e-based<br/>tuning&quot; with a fifth of around 704.61 cents, and a ratio of whole-tone<br/>to diatonic semitone equal to Leonhard Euler&apos;s e, I would not<br/>necessarily claim any special psychoacoustical properties for it not<br/>shared by other tunings in the very close vicinity.</p><p>More specifically, when it is realized as a 24-note tuning, this<br/>e-based temperament includes a variety of minor seventh (actually a<br/>major sixth plus diesis) almost identical to a pure 7:4 -- most<br/>felicitous, since Euler was an early European champion of this<br/>ratio. However, while the use of e as a generator may be a charming<br/>example of serendipity (or &quot;syncronicity&quot;), we could also produce a<br/>musically similar result simply by calculating a fifth size where a<br/>chain of 15 fifths up generates a pure 7:4 -- ~704.588 cents.</p><p>This is a lot of fifths, and your chain-of-fifths paper made the<br/>quite reasonable choice to draw a line at a chain no longer than 14,<br/>although offering tools for those interested in longer chains. If you<br/>had drawn a slightly different line, then your methods would have<br/>identified this region without any need to use e.</p><p><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/2ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/2ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm</a></p><p>In fact, when I hit on the idea of the e-based tuning, I wasn&apos;t sure<br/>of exactly what musical results it might produce; and having explored<br/>them, I have found them in other tunings in the general region also.<br/>In turn, it was through comparing 24-note versions of these tunings<br/>that I came to realize that chain of 13 or 14 fifths were moving<br/>toward 7-based ratios (9:7, 7:6) a bit beyond 46-tET, and then to<br/>discover that 15 e-based fifths yielded a near-pure 7:4.</p><p>Having expressed my own viewpoint, I would like fully to acknowledge<br/>yours, which also has a long and honorable tradition, inviting any<br/>correction to my attempted statement of it: &quot;Numbers used in<br/>discussions of tunings should have acoustical significance, and<br/>integers should not be multiplied without purpose.&quot;</p><p>To quote Zarlino (1558) on notational intricacies appealing to the eye<br/>of the performer rather than the ear of the listener -- and the use of<br/>&quot;audibly not discrete integer ratios&quot; might be placed in much the same<br/>category:</p><p>         &quot;Why then do some persons work so hard to introduce<br/>          so many intricacies into their compositions?....<br/>          I know that those who employ these devices, if they<br/>          have any sense, will reply that such things have no<br/>          value at all, because when their ciphers are reduced<br/>          to simple common terms the harmony will be as good<br/>          as before. Since they do not contribute to better<br/>          harmony and cannot be perceived by the senses, why<br/>          burden the singer with such things needlessly?....<br/>          My advice is to ignore such ciphers and to<br/>          concentrate on those matters that lead to the<br/>          production of good sweet harmonies.&quot;[1]</p><p>Possibly even more Keenanesque is the comment of Zarlino soon<br/>following:</p><p>         &quot;Thus it may be truthfully said that this method<br/>          of composing results only in needlessly multiplying<br/>          difficulties without increasing harmoniousness.<br/>          Therefore it is useless, for, as the Philosopher<br/>          says, it is vain to multiply anything with no<br/>          purpose.&quot;[2]</p><p>Here is a musical application of a rule of parsimony here attributed<br/>to Aristotle (often known simply as &quot;the Philosopher&quot; to late medieval<br/>and Renaissance authors), but which might also be called Occam&apos;s Razor<br/>or Keenan&apos;s Sand Filter, to invoke a worthy contemporary recycling<br/>technology.</p><p>The immediately following sentences also have a Keenanesque ring to<br/>me:</p><p>          &quot;For music, being a science that deals with sounds and<br/>           tones -- particular objects of the sense of hearing --<br/>           is concerned only with the sonority (as Ammonius says)<br/>           that springs from pitches and tones, and with nothing<br/>           else. Therefore it seems to me that all musical<br/>           speculations not directed toward this end are vain<br/>           and useless.&quot;[3]</p><p>In responding to your statement, I feel it very important to<br/>acknowledge the tradition from which I perceive you come, not only<br/>understanding it but relishing it, and possibly in the process<br/>clarifying my own sometimes more emblematic leanings.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

S. Bach.</p><p>No evidence for Mahler&apos;s use of any of this... and given my<br/>knowledge of Mahler, I&apos;d say with confidence that he never did<br/>any of this.</p><p>Schoenberg seems to have been very intrigued by this stuff.<br/>There&apos;s even a book called _Schoenberg: the Composer as<br/>Numerologist_, in which many Schoenberg compositions are<br/>subjected to numerological analysis.  I leave it up to the<br/>reader to decide how convincing the author&apos;s argument is.</p><p>But there is no doubt in my mind that both Schoenberg and<br/>Berg used Cabbala in their pieces.  Many motives and tone-rows<br/>use pitches whose sequential letter-names spell out (at least<br/>partially) the names of the composers or other people closely<br/>associated with them.  Berg wrote his famous _Lyric Suite_ as<br/>a secret love-gift to his secret lover, and it&apos;s filled with<br/>this kind of thing.

Schoenberg also had a deep and<br/>complex involvement with his original religion of Judaism, so<br/>it&apos;s not at all surprising to me that he would know about and<br/>make use of Cabbala.</p><p>Some of Webern&apos;s pieces are based on a four-note motive of the<br/>notes Bb-A-C-B, which is B-A-C-H in German musical notation,<br/>which is the same thing Bach did in his _Art of Fugue_.

When I&apos;m writing a melody played on a choice<br/>selection of intervals (no matter what their method of derivation), a<br/>part of my musical judgment comes into play, which is not always<br/>thinking about the numbers, yet this act of creation brings the most<br/>personal and audible &quot;psychoacoustical significance&quot; to my ears in<br/>the &quot;tangible&quot; form of *music*. The creative process of making all<br/>this become manifest in the reality of music, is something which<br/>ultimately can defy mathematical analysis (especially the process of<br/>what it takes to compose compelling melodies), because<br/>personal &quot;choice&quot;, and the sum of who you are, comes into play.  This<br/>diversity conveniently provided by good old Mother Nature, in this<br/>regard, gives us an infinity of wonderful and valid possibilities,<br/>which are invariably tempered by our own musical tastes.</p><p>&gt; The use of large prime numbers in tunings seems to me to admit of a<br/>&gt; similar kind of technique: picking emblematic or otherwise<br/>attractive<br/>&gt; numbers, and building a tuning on them. Of course, I would look at<br/>the<br/>&gt; values in cents to see what the likely effect might be -- with<br/>&gt; performance in an actual timbre (another variable) confirming,<br/>&gt; denying, or modifying such an estimation.</p><p>This I agree with, and would add that to chose large prime ratios is<br/>yet but another valid method of tuning/pitch measurement.  And yes,<br/>the resulting cents values - along with their unique audible<br/>properties must be the goal (as in my MOS scales built from prime<br/>ratios, where &quot;finding&quot; a selection of choice thirds was the primary<br/>goal.).</p><p>&gt; When someone like Jacky Ligon or Robert Walker finds interesting<br/>&gt; mathematical patterns in musically-applied primes, then I would<br/>&gt; certainly agree that we can and should ask whether such patterns<br/>might<br/>&gt; have any special significance, or might be explained by some more<br/>&gt; general mathematical principles, as Paul Erlich has done most<br/>&gt; skillfully in one very recent instance.</p><p>It may be worth noting, that the method of scale construction shown<br/>in my initial article;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_17399.html#17399">/tuning/topicId_17399.html#17399</a></p><p>and the use of prime series ratios displayed in the &quot;2001: A MOS<br/>Odyssey&quot; posts;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_17744.html#17744">/tuning/topicId_17744.html#17744</a></p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18025.html#18025">/tuning/topicId_18025.html#18025</a></p><p>as well as the speculative post about mediants;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18060.html#18060">/tuning/topicId_18060.html#18060</a></p><p>all stand as three mutually exclusive, and perhaps disconnected<br/>investigations into the use of prime series ratios.</p><p>&gt; However, the use of a ratio in itself seems to me a matter of art --<br/>&gt; be it emblematic, purely arbitrary (&quot;I like the number, or intuit<br/>that<br/>&gt; somehow it may produce an interesting result&quot;), or done in a<br/>carefully<br/>&gt; calculated &quot;psychoacoustical&quot; way.

I think it is an ON-T....</p><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>I don&apos;t think this is OT at all.  If Schoenberg really was using<br/>numerology in his &quot;free atonality&quot; pieces as that book I mentioned<br/>strongly argues, then that practice had a definite influence on<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s later formulation of the 12-tone serial method.  The<br/>evolution of this method shows a clear association in Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>mind between pitches and the 12-integer sequence.</p><p>The point I&apos;m emphasizing (which makes this on-topic) is the<br/>corellation of numbers - and all that they signify, to both<br/>mathematicians and numerologists - with discrete equal divisions<br/>of the pitch-continuum.</p><p>As I will be outlining in my upcoming presentation, Schoenberg<br/>and his students did explore microtones a bit, and ultimately<br/>rejected using them.  I have a hunch that numerology was at<br/>least partly responsible for Schoenberg&apos;s decision, because<br/>12 is a powerful number in both numerology and mathmatics,<br/>since it is so readily divisible (into 2, 3, 4, and 6).</p><p>(Despite my own fascination with numbers, I really don&apos;t know<br/>much about numerology.  Those who do are encouraged to jump in<br/>here.)</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I don&apos;t actually have the numerology/Caballa info<br/>regarding Berg at hand.

Kabbalah is a body of creative<br/>interpretive practices, begun after the canon of Jewish religious texts was<br/>considered to be closed to new additions. Among the several disciplines of<br/>Kabalah was the Gematria, which considered relations between numbers<br/>assigned to the Hebrew letters of the Torah.</p><p>Identifying Berg&apos;s use of cyphers (akin to Schumann&apos;s sphynxes) as a form of<br/>Kabbalah is both inappropriate and wrong, there being no basis in the Torah<br/>whatsoever for the cypher. The case of Schoenberg is more complicated, as,<br/>at least in later years, he aspired to a writing an explicity Jewish music.<br/>However, Schoenberg&apos;s Judaism was a sui generis unorthodoxy, with precious<br/>little connection to actual mystical traditions (one cannot _exclude_ the<br/>possibility of Schoenberg&apos;s Kabbalahism, though: the mystical tradition is<br/>too full of sui generis inventions!).</p><p>If anyone wants to pursue this OT topic further, the best place to start is<br/>probably with the brilliant writings of Gershom Scholem.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest</p></div><h3><a id=18341 href="#18341">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
