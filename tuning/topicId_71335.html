When it is a question of civilization and culture, we, the &quot;diverse non-European peoples&quot; belong to Islam not only in faith, but also in arts, architecture, poetry, sciences, etc... with a wealth of regional flavours to boot. This has been so, until the barrage of Westernism wrecked and continues to threaten everything good and wholesome around these parts.</p><p>Thus, it is no surprise, that Middle Eastern music and theory has Islamic connotations from the building of instruments to the singing of microtones, performance traditions, intonation, style, form, etc... Amazingly, almost all our classical schools - be they Abbasid, Ottoman, Safavid, Timurid, Baburid - have the signature of Islamic Civilization.</p><p>For another thing, it is our Prophet who himself encouraged merry-making with music. We do not listen to the dwindling fools who think music-making, poetry, painting, sculpture and chess-playing are forbidden by this or that fabricated hadith. (I, for one, am a Mutazilite, remember?)</p><p>Now, do you find it shocking that Islam is more than a political identity for us?</p><p>As for Taliban, well... they have been incited by the USA to counter the Soviet advance during the Cold War. Never in the history of Islam could such an anomaly be installed in power, if not for the interference by outside forces. A similar phenomenon occured in Iran too. But bigotry has always been a dwindling minority among Muslims. The overwhelming majority are ordinary people who like to enjoy the fruits of life as is their right. Besides, narrow-mindedness may be observed independent of geography, religion and culture throughout history, and is not in the least particular to Islamic societies.</p><p>Would you then incline to such awkward examples to validate your point? Would you like it if I brought up the difficulties of music-making in the atheistic Stalanist regime to scratch the contributions of Shostakovitch? Shame.</p><p>So, none of your glorified ethnicism here. It makes no difference whether Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, Safi al-din were Turkish/Persian/Arabic or not. What matters is, that they adhered to a unique Islamic culture. Thus, their contributions to the world and humanity are all but Islamic, just as those of Socrates, Platon, Aristotle were Greek, and the works of Descartes, Kant and Hegel were European.</p><p>Oz.</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 22 Nisan 2007 Pazar 16:34<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Has anyone read or reviewed this Serge Donval book yet?</p><p>  I see that Charles Lucy sees a rehash, seeing little originality.

That is a geographical denomination dependent on the<br/>Francoitalian conceptualization of the Mediterranean East. Jewish and<br/>Christian artists of the region were always encouraged by Muslim patrons,<br/>unless operating under the sanctions of their isolate<br/>community/church/synagogue. But these dhimmis were not in the least leading,<br/>but a minority. Besides, commissioned works are just as Islamic as Haydn&apos;s<br/>are European. A simple glance at Armenians and Greeks of the Ottoman Empire<br/>will show that they played on the same tanbur, used the same traditional<br/>perde names, and composed in known modes and forms of Maqam Music. Famous<br/>examples include Kantemir, Harutin, and Hamparsum.</p><p>As for Byzantine Church Music, it dissapeared with the collapse of the<br/>Byzantine Empire in 1453. The remnants may be named &quot;Eastern&quot; or &quot;Orthodox&quot;,<br/>as distinct from Russian Orthodox. Not surprisingly, Coptic, Armenian, and<br/>Greek communities remained under the Islamic influence for centuries<br/>thereafter and adopted the musical jargons of the Islamic Civilization. On<br/>the other hand, I have little information on their state of affairs prior to<br/>the collapse, or how much of the Ancient Greek tetrachordal tradition they<br/>carried into the new era.

Forgive me its length.  I send it with<br/>trepidation because I do not wish to offend or enrage.  At most to<br/>share some of the things I have had the good fortune to encounter.<br/>If I do offend, please forgive me -- it is accidental and caused by<br/>my weakness of mind.</p><p>I think blindness toward the contribution of Islamic culture to<br/>Western culture is not limited to music.</p><p>But it is not universal.  The historian Oswald Spengler said that<br/>Charlemagne court was but a reflection of the light from Baghdad<br/>under the Caliphs.  He had interesting comments on Islamic<br/>jurisprudence and some deep ideas about the Sufis.  Some people know of the influence of Arabic literature (and music?) on the<br/>troubadours, some others on Dante, Chaucer and Shakespeare.<br/>Scientifically, Islamic sources contributed greatly to the West.<br/>Alchemy and then chemistry owe a huge amount to Geber -- Abu Musa<br/>Jabir ibn Hayyan.  Some even know that Muslim scientists knew of the<br/>heart as a pump before the Europeans.  The influence of Islamic<br/>philosophers upon Scholastic Philosophy is huge.  It&apos;s also<br/>interesting that Descartes&apos; famous dictum is presaged by a thought<br/>experiment of Ibn Sina, while Pascal&apos;s Wager appears (in vitro) in al Ghazzali.  Ibn Sina&apos;s text on medicine was standard in the West until<br/>the 1700s.  Numerous folk tales considered Western have Eastern<br/>antecedents (William Tell, for example).  Trade was also much more<br/>extensive than imagined  -- with trade settlements of Muslims in what<br/>is now Switzerland and raiding along the coast of England in the<br/>1400s!  And even the Western magical tradition was heavily influenced<br/>by an Arabic source, still not fully translated into English: the<br/>Picatrix.</p><p>As someone very interested in those matters, but also not skilled in<br/>reading Arabic, Turkish or Persian I am stymied by the dearth of<br/>translations.  I am glad for the D&apos;Erlanger translation of Farabi,<br/>but surely an English version is warranted.  Many translations of<br/>other important documents have been made -- bits here and there,<br/>published here and there in hard to obtain specialist journals.<br/>While the Internet is catching up with much literature, vast amounts<br/>need to be scanned.  In the study of Arabic music we still rely on<br/>Henry Farmer.  Surely there can be more added in all these years?<br/>It&apos;s like someone using the Britannica 11th edition as the best<br/>source of knowledge.</p><p>Overall, the lack of translations from Persian, Arabic and Turkish in ALL fields is extremely problematic.  Philosophy, literature, history<br/>are all underrepresented in easily obtained, readable translations.<br/>I must complain about the far too many scholarly articles which are<br/>stylistically unreadable, hopelessly disorganized and intellectually<br/>weak.  Surely these people can do better.  Surely, they can do more.<br/>Their expertise is desperately needed in these days when cultural<br/>miscomprehension is so widespread.</p><p>If more effective work were done in this area then the relationships<br/>and contributions would be more widely known.  Instead we have<br/>comments from people like Bertrand Russell that the Arabic/Persian/<br/>Turkish philosophers added nothing original to philosophy.  Sadly<br/>absurd.  Sad because he could write this at all, showing his own lack<br/>of mere information.  But I do not doubt that you can earn a degree<br/>in philosophy without ever reading an Arabic philosopher.  I know you<br/>can earn a degree in Religious Studies without ever being required to<br/>read the Qur&apos;an complete or study Islam in any great depth (having<br/>met such a person -- very intelligent and who went beyond the minimum<br/>requirements and did read the Qur&apos;an.  I shudder to think what goes<br/>on at overtly Christian colleges.) .  But it&apos;s still a shame.  In<br/>Western music theory Arabic theory does not enter into the matter --<br/>much to the loss of say Schenker, whose conceptions of counterpoint<br/>would be revealed as culturally biased and not universal truths as he<br/>said.</p><p>Knowledge of Eastern influences would do much to assist Western<br/>thinkers resist supremacist notions, although it might not prevent<br/>supremacist behaviour.  Would knowing about Al Farabi change the<br/>behaviour of certain Western governments, or trans-national<br/>corporations?  We in the West can certainly learn a great deal from<br/>Eastern observers (&apos;Would some god the gift give us to see ourselves<br/>as others see us&apos; - Burns).   On the other hand, the East should know<br/>that a similar freedom of critique must be permitted in return and<br/>not all of it would count as blasphemy.

I applaud your sentiments and admit to the pleasure of having learnt much escaping my attention from your delightful summary.</p><p>As a side note, I have myself expressed to John Chalmers in a private dialogue not long ago my sadness that no English translation of d&apos;Erlanger&apos;s monumental work was available, and suggested a collaborative effort in the future toward the realization of this goal.</p><p>But really, this is just the tip of the iceberg. I share your concern regarding the insufficieny of research into Islamic literature. To think that such a prevalent figure of the past century as Russell could dismiss in absolute ignorance the contributions of Islamic thinkers to world and humanity is nothing short of horrific, if not altogether hollow. Regrettably, such a demeanour appears to be contagious, as we have experienced in the unfortunate remark by Johnny Reinhard recently.</p><p>I agree that criticism is an indispensible tool in aiding objective scientific thinking. Thus, I support an undogmatic perspective which recognizes not only the existence and importance, but also the beauty, of &quot;alien&quot; cultures.</p><p>Concomitantly, I would like to declare my sincere admiration, as a Muslim Turk, of &quot;The Messiah&quot; by Handel, &quot;Requiem Mass&quot; by Mozart, and &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; by Beethoven. I need not mention, that this list may be expanded indefinitely.</p><p>As for the classification problem... I am certain that &quot;Islamic Civilization and Culture&quot; is a term most befitting for the purpose. If not that, then there is always &quot;Caliphate&quot;, which conveys some idea of sociopolitical centrality based on Muslim rule. However, I prefer the former, since Mughals were just as Islamic as Spain till 15th century despite the absence of political unity. Also, I am tempted to use Mutazili as an indication to a period of enlightenment between 8th-13th centuries.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gordon Rumson<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 23 Nisan 2007 Pazartesi 20:02<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Has anyone read or reviewed this Serge Donval book yet?</p><p>  Greetings,</p><p>  This message began as a quick reply and has now grown beyond all reasonable proportions.  Forgive me its length.  I send it with trepidation because I do not wish to offend or enrage.  At most to share some of the things I have had the good fortune to encounter.  If I do offend, please forgive me -- it is accidental and caused by my weakness of mind.</p><p>  I think blindness toward the contribution of Islamic culture to Western culture is not limited to music.</p><p>  But it is not universal.  The historian Oswald Spengler said that Charlemagne court was but a reflection of the light from Baghdad under the Caliphs.  He had interesting comments on Islamic jurisprudence and some deep ideas about the Sufis.  Some people know of the influence of Arabic literature (and music?) on the troubadours, some others on Dante, Chaucer and Shakespeare.   Scientifically, Islamic sources contributed greatly to the West.  Alchemy and then chemistry owe a huge amount to Geber -- Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan.  Some even know that Muslim scientists knew of the heart as a pump before the Europeans.  The influence of Islamic philosophers upon Scholastic Philosophy is huge.  It&apos;s also interesting that Descartes&apos; famous dictum is presaged by a thought experiment of Ibn Sina, while Pascal&apos;s Wager appears (in vitro) in al Ghazzali.  Ibn Sina&apos;s text on medicine was standard in the West until the 1700s.  Numerous folk tales considered Western have Eastern antecedents (William Tell, for example).  Trade was also much more extensive than imagined  -- with trade settlements of Muslims in what is now Switzerland and raiding along the coast of England in the 1400s!  And even the Western magical tradition was heavily influenced by an Arabic source, still not fully translated into English: the Picatrix.</p><p>  As someone very interested in those matters, but also not skilled in reading Arabic, Turkish or Persian I am stymied by the dearth of translations.  I am glad for the D&apos;Erlanger translation of Farabi, but surely an English version is warranted.  Many translations of other important documents have been made -- bits here and there, published here and there in hard to obtain specialist journals.  While the Internet is catching up with much literature, vast amounts need to be scanned.  In the study of Arabic music we still rely on Henry Farmer.  Surely there can be more added in all these years?  It&apos;s like someone using the Britannica 11th edition as the best source of knowledge.</p><p>  Overall, the lack of translations from Persian, Arabic and Turkish in ALL fields is extremely problematic.  Philosophy, literature, history are all underrepresented in easily obtained, readable translations.  I must complain about the far too many scholarly articles which are stylistically unreadable, hopelessly disorganized and intellectually weak.  Surely these people can do better.  Surely, they can do more.  Their expertise is desperately needed in these days when cultural miscomprehension is so widespread.</p><p>  If more effective work were done in this area then the relationships and contributions would be more widely known.  Instead we have comments from people like Bertrand Russell that the Arabic/Persian/Turkish philosophers added nothing original to philosophy.  Sadly absurd.  Sad because he could write this at all, showing his own lack of mere information.  But I do not doubt that you can earn a degree in philosophy without ever reading an Arabic philosopher.  I know you can earn a degree in Religious Studies without ever being required to read the Qur&apos;an complete or study Islam in any great depth (having met such a person -- very intelligent and who went beyond the minimum requirements and did read the Qur&apos;an.  I shudder to think what goes on at overtly Christian colleges.) .  But it&apos;s still a shame.  In Western music theory Arabic theory does not enter into the matter -- much to the loss of say Schenker, whose conceptions of counterpoint would be revealed as culturally biased and not universal truths as he said.</p><p>  Knowledge of Eastern influences would do much to assist Western thinkers resist supremacist notions, although it might not prevent supremacist behaviour.  Would knowing about Al Farabi change the behaviour of certain Western governments, or trans-national corporations?  We in the West can certainly learn a great deal from Eastern observers (&apos;Would some god the gift give us to see ourselves as others see us&apos; - Burns).   On the other hand, the East should know that a similar freedom of critique must be permitted in return and not all of it would count as blasphemy.  We must also beware of cultural insults:  &quot;See, we taught them everything!&quot;  or &quot;We just took up the ideas they couldn&apos;t develop.&quot;  The path to advancing civilization is murky and much is invisible -- I think of the blind men and the elephant.  I fear that not one side or the other of any cultural divide is Paradise on the one hand or the World of War on the other.</p><p>  A very interesting site for wide ranging information about Middle Eastern culture is at:</p><p>  <a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com">http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com</a></p><p>  A list of subjects covered is at:</p><p>  <a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/index/Subjects.aspx">http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/index/Subjects.aspx</a></p><p>  The articles on music are fascinating (see below).

But I also love the great Nubian oud  master (who&apos;s<br/>name escapes me at this late hour).  I hear something other  than<br/>Egyptian/Arabic/Islamic input, finding something else, something gorgeous  to me.  Please<br/>feel free to add Jewish music here.  It is also melodic  and sounds like it<br/>might have a maqam basis...only its not Islamic.</p><p>Frankly the melodic textures of the music are not all  that of one thing for<br/>me.  Hindu, Baul, and all sorts of sub-continent  music seems nothing like<br/>Arabic music.   I would feel using an  Islamic brush for all of these diverse<br/>musics does not make total sense in my  concept of the world.  (there&apos;s no need<br/>to insult here)</p><p>I love the music, but see a different connection between the  things.  That&apos;s<br/>a different perspective, maybe even occasionally  original.  You know, for<br/>over 30 years I used to tell people how  fascinating it will be when a truly<br/>great Turkish history of the world is  written.

I<br/>think the secular Turks have it  right.</p><p>Likewise, was Schubert, Tschaikovsky,  or Mendelssohn more national composers<br/>than  European?</p><p>See here we have the point,  how to categorize.  Sure they are each<br/>europeans.  But why not include  Dvorak (Czech) or Sibelius (Suomi).   Regardless,<br/>neither the category  of a  national or European composer has anything to do with<br/>religion.

I do not understand your hatred for nationalism, except as more of a Turkish phenomenon.  There articles in the press about the need for a secular leader of Turkey, for example.</p><p>Me? Hatred for an ideology that is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people in the past century alone? Don&apos;t be ridiculous. Mine is not hatred, only rancour.</p><p>And I feel that secularism is much overrated.</p><p>    Not your ignorance, but your ongoing unawareness contrary to all my efforts to elucidate the substance of Maqam Music theory as a prevalent Islamic entity despite every effort at nationalization.<br/>  SNIP<br/>    Do you find it amusing that Arabs, Turks, Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Pakis, Hindus, Afghanis, practice similar melodic textures?<br/>  Personally, I love arabic music, especially the classics like Om Kalsoum and Mohammed Abdel Wahab.  But I also love the great Nubian oud master (who&apos;s name escapes me at this late hour).  I hear something other than Egyptian/Arabic/Islamic input, finding something else, something gorgeous to me.  Please feel free to add Jewish music here.  It is also melodic and sounds like it might have a maqam basis...only its not Islamic.</p><p>Umm Gulthum and Abdulwahhab were, indeed, Arabic singers of Maqam Music. I do not in the least deny nationalities and local flavours in the Middle East, but find the inclusion of Nikolaki and Tatyos Efendi under such denominations as Arabic Music or Greek Music foolish. Our musical tradition, from the nomenclature of perdes to maqamat, ousulat, forms and instruments, was in Islam what Classical Music is to the Christian West... Do you find this impalatable?</p><p>One does not categorically need be defined as a Muslim to be a part of the Islamic Civilization. I find no difficulty in considering the Eastern Church and Levantine Jewish communities as part of the Islamic entity with its endless diversity and regional flavours.</p><p>  Frankly the melodic textures of the music are not all that of one thing for me.  Hindu, Baul, and all sorts of sub-continent music seems nothing like Arabic music.   I would feel using an Islamic brush for all of these diverse musics does not make total sense in my concept of the world.  (there&apos;s no need to insult here)</p><p>My good man, why do you insist on thinking of Islam as only a religion and fail to percieve the art and culture behind it? Do you think the great mosque of Cordoba and Taj Mahal have nothing in common?</p><p>  I love the music, but see a different connection between the things.  That&apos;s a different perspective, maybe even occasionally original.</p><p>Unenlighteningly so.</p><p>  You know, for over 30 years I used to tell people how fascinating it will be when a truly great Turkish history of the world is written.  Ozan, your taking my dream away...and we were so close.  By any chance, are there any parts to your ancestry that is not ethnic Turk?</p><p>What has my ethnicity got to do anything with the fact that I am a Turkish-speaking Muslim male born and bred in Istanbul?</p><p>The way I see it, pre-Islamic Turkish history, or any Turkish history independent of Islam, is peripheral. There is nothing at all great about nomad-warriors who were animists.</p><p>    Is it any wonder that perde names remain, for the most part, the same in at least the first three nations?<br/>  Nothing that shows commonality between adjacent nations would surprise me.  I am just not going to accept a world view that is based on religion.  I think the secular Turks have it right.</p><p>Coming from the godless, such words convince me that it is the Muslims who have it right. Islam is not simply a religion, it is a civilization and a cultural framework extending across national boundaries.</p><p>    Likewise, was Schubert, Tschaikovsky, or Mendelssohn more national composers than European?</p><p>  See here we have the point, how to categorize.  Sure they are each europeans.  But why not include Dvorak (Czech) or Sibelius (Suomi).   Regardless, neither the category of a  national or European composer has anything to do with religion.</p><p>Utter nonsense. Even the single example of J. S. Bach as a Lutheran musician whose compositions are tinted with the Germanic Protestant Baroque style suffice to prove, that, until the 19th century, art in Europe and Middle East had religio-cultural connotations.</p><p>I wish you desist from applying the jargons of the industrial age to pre-industrial times.</p><p>  Since it is not necessary to use religion as a measurement for the contributions of people, it is not necessary for it to intrude.  In this way, Felix Mendelssohn need not be seen as a prominent Jew converting to Christianity in an anti-semitic Germany.  Can be a European, even if his status as a German was viciously fought by his fellows?</p><p>Mendelssohn was a Romantic composer of Europe, German only for the fact that he lived there. He is an excellent example of those musicians who made it into the age of nationalism, but were not quite national themselves.</p><p>  yours, Johnny</p><p>  Cordially,<br/>  Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=71467 href="#71467">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2007 1:28:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Most appreciated dear colleague,</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gordon Rumson<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 25 Nisan 2007 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 20:06<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Has anyone read or reviewed this Serge Donval book yet?</p><p>  Greetings,</p><p>  Thank you for the supportive words for my post.
