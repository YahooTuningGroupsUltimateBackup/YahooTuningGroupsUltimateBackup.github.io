In 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, the fifth is flat by a quarter comma, a quar c, or quark. In<br/>441-et, the quark is two schismas, and is the same as 5120/5103 (for<br/>which Sagittal has a symbol.)</p><p>441-et is not the only interesting et where we can play this game, by<br/>the way. 1783 is a super-accurate 5-limit tuning, and it has a 5^(1/4)<br/>in it also. 789 is a denominator for a convergent to 5^(1/4), (1783<br/>being a semiconvergent) and also gives a super-accurate version of 1/4-<br/>comma meantone. Twice 789 is 1578, which is a very strong high limit<br/>(29 and stuff) system, so we could do something like the 217 bicycle<br/>chains notation idea with two chains. Other ideas along similar lines<br/>involve 224, 684, 2019, 2460, 3125, 3566, 5144, 5585 and 6691, for<br/>instance. 2460 already is a sort of universal system for Sagittal, and<br/>this would be another bicycle-chain system, as 2460=12*205. Hence it is<br/>12 cycles of the 205 approximation to 1/4 comma, separated by 100<br/>cents, similar to but more elaborate than the 217 business George was<br/>talking about.</p></div><h3><a id=70107 href="#70107">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
