The upshot is<br/>that this is a fine tuning for 11-limit meantone in its huygens, or<br/>31&amp;43, incarnation; in fact it is a poptimal generator for huygens.</p><p>&gt; This tuning may have been mentioned here before, but alas, Yahoo<br/>&gt; searching sucks, so I couldn&apos;t find a reference (does anyone see my<br/>&gt; point here about *avoiding* redundency? For all I know, there might<br/>&gt; be a huhe thread on this topic that I *could have* researched, but<br/>&gt; we are stuck with knowledge that we can&apos;t access--like being at a<br/>&gt; library without a catalogue!)</p><p>I hope the above has related it at least a little. If you aren&apos;t going<br/>to simply use 31-et for huygens/meanpop and give up trying to<br/>distinguish them, this fifth seems like a fine choice, since it gives<br/>us those pure 7/4s.</p><p>&gt; Gorgeous for renaissance, folk, etc. try it out!</p><p>The most interesting would be to find a piece with a lot of German<br/>sixths. There doesn&apos;t seem to be a lot of point in making a big fuss<br/>over exact 7/4s when they never actually occur.</p><p>You could go through the table of 9-limit consonances and see what you<br/>turned up in this way:</p><p>3/2: Pythagorean, 3/2 fifth, 701.955 cents</p><p>5/4: 1/4-comma, 5^(1/4) fifth, 696.578 cents</p><p>6/5: 1/3-comma, (10/3)^(1/3) fifth, 694.768 cents</p><p>7/4: ~4/17 comma, 56^(1/10) fifth, 696.883 cents</p><p>7/5: ~2/9 comma, (56/5)^(1/6) fifth, 697.085 cents</p><p>7/6: ~5/19 comma, (112/3)^(1/9) fifth, 696.319 cents</p><p>9/7: ~5/17 comma, (224/9)^(1/8) fifth, 695.614 cents</p><p>I&apos;ve mention the (224/9)^(1/8) fifth a few times since it is so close<br/>to both the Wilson fifth and 69-equal. The (112/3)^(1/9) fifth is<br/>quite interesting; it is very close to 81-et, and is 5-limit poptimal.<br/>The tritonic fifth of (56/5)^(1/6) might be good for someone wanting<br/>something a shade sharper than your septimal fifth of 56^(1/10), and<br/>since the complexity of the tritone in meantone is 6, these are more<br/>likely to occur than the pure 7/4s.</p></div><h3><a id=55457 href="#55457">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2004 1:16:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;Theoretically, it&apos;s generator 5th is virtually the same as 205 steps<br/>&gt; &gt;of 353-tet (which is 696.884 while the true one is 696.883)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jorgensen in _Tuning_ gives it about half of page 94, along with<br/>discussion<br/>&gt; of Robert Smith (1749).
