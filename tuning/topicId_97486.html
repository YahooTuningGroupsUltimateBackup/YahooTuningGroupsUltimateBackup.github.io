Some of them are &gt; fairly experienced in the field of acoustics and I managed to get in &gt; contact with them. While discussing possible software/hardware equipment, &gt; we were also bringing up the question of finding an interactive way to use &gt; alternative tunings with the help of Scala for the purpose of music &gt; composition. The question now is whether to go for a hardware solution or &gt; a software one. What is needed is basically the possibility to make a few &gt; calculations which result in a scale and then be able to load Scala&apos;s &gt; output to a device playable with a keyboard. Someone suggested using &gt; Absynth since one of the computers in one classroom there has a MIDI &gt; keyboard attached to it. The reason why I&apos;m sceptical about Absynth is &gt; that before you can play the scale, you have to 1) make a &quot;.gly&quot; file, 2) &gt; copy it into Absynth&apos;s tuning folder (which resides pretty down there &gt; somewhere in a deep subdirectory), 3) restart Absynth, 4) find and load &gt; the scale. This takes so much time that I would first have to do this for &gt; all the scales I intend to use for explaining a topic before starting with &gt; the explanation, which strips me of the possibility to interactively play &gt; scales that come to my mind during my speech as a result of my instant &gt; thoughts -- I really can&apos;t know in advance about all possible scales which &gt; I&apos;ll wish to use during a presentation or something. Someone else &gt; suggested loading a VST instrument into Cubase as some of them support &gt; MTS. But the problem there is that that forces you to create a new track &gt; each time you want to change the tuning, which, again, adds time to the &gt; preceding step of first converting it to MTS. Honestly, I don&apos;t mind about &gt; converting it to any format that Scala supports (be it MTS or &quot;.gly&quot; or &gt; whatever out of the 100-something options) but I would like to find a &gt; solution where there would be no more other major time taking steps than &gt; the conversion. That&apos;s why I was also thinking about possibly using a &gt; hardware &quot;workstation&quot; which might be connected to the MIDI interface of &gt; the PC and receive retuning commands directly from Scala. However, this &gt; choice raises two issues. One is that I have absolutely no idea about the &gt; various tuning limitations of todays instruments and I don&apos;t know where to &gt; learn something about them. Another is that if it were a new instrument &gt; which Manuel doesn&apos;t know about, we would need a thorough description of &gt; the format of the tuning messages to be sent to the instrument. A few &gt; years ago, I swapped a couple of letters with Daniel Forr&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; asking him what &gt; he could tell me about retuning the Korg PA instruments via MIDI. IIRC &gt; (correct me if I&apos;m wrong, Daniel), he answered that the documentation &gt; didn&apos;t say anything about MIDI implementation and that even some people &gt; who allegedly were in closer contact with the company didn&apos;t have any &gt; papers concerning MIDI implementation. The same seemed to be the case with &gt; the older sampler of Emu ESI-32. This surprises me a lot, considering the &gt; fact that Yamaha, as part of the documentation for their XG instruments &gt; back in the 90s, was giving a very detailed description of almost every &gt; possible SysEx message you could think of, which later allowed me to write &gt; a small QBasic utility for converting plain text numbers to XG tuning &gt; files. But if Korg or Emu don&apos;t allow us to retune their &quot;synths&quot; in any &gt; other way than manually on the pannel, then I just absolutely don&apos;t have &gt; anything to suggest to Manuel for possibly improving Scala.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any thoughts on this? Thanks in advance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
