From the Associated Press:</p><p>&quot;BERLIN (AP) &mdash; Oskar Sala, the German composer and physicist whose novel<br/>musical instrument produced the sound effects for Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s<br/>&quot;The Birds,&quot; died Tuesday, February 26.  He was 91.</p><p>Born in the eastern German town of Greiz, Sala is known for developing<br/>and mastering the trautonium, billed as the world&apos;s first electronic<br/>musical instrument on its invention in 1929.</p><p>He performed with the Berlin Philharmonic several times, and the<br/>instrument &mdash; a precursor to the synthesizer &mdash; was frequently used in<br/>German ads in the 1940s and 1950s.</p><p>The trautonium was most famously employed to produce the bird calls in<br/>Hitchcock&apos;s 1963 film.  Few people realized the cacophonous calls on the<br/>film were produced electronically.</p><p>Sala donated his original Mixtur-Trautonium to the German Museum for<br/>Contemporary Technology in Bonn in 1995.&quot;</p></div>
