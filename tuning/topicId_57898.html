Lots<br/>of neat microtonal stuff, done quite deliberately.<br/>He said he has a record out on New Albion.  He had<br/>five flutes (soprano, alto, contrabass, and two others),<br/>all with microphones (and corresponding pedals and<br/>electronics) and several with his &quot;Matusiflute&quot; kazoo-<br/>like modification.</p><p>Anybody ever hear his stuff?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
