The standard, or<br/>_quarter-comma MT_, distributes the comma among four fifths, so that their<br/>octave-reduced sum is a just major third (5:4, 386.3 cents).  The pefect fifth<br/>in quarter-comma MT has a size of 696.6 cents.  Such a fifth can be tuned by ear<br/>by<br/>initially setting a just major third (i.e. c&apos;-e&apos;) and then, tempering the<br/>intermediate fifths identically (octave reduced: c&apos;-g&apos;-d&apos;-a&apos;-e&apos;). The name MT is<br/>derived from the size of the wholetone (193.15 cents), which divides the just<br/>major third equally and falls between between the just major (9:8) and minor<br/>(10:9) wholetones.</p><p>Variants of MT include:</p><p>Third-comma temperament, where an octave-reduced just major sixth (5:3, 884.4<br/>cents) is<br/>the sum of three fifths of 693.3 cents),</p><p>Fifth-comma temperament, where an octave-reduced just major seventh (15:8,<br/>1088.3 cents) is<br/>the sum of five fifths of 697.6 cents),</p><p>Sixth-comma temperament, where an octave-reduced just augmented fourth (45:32,<br/>590.2 cents)<br/>is the sum of six fifths of 698.4 cents). Sixth-comma MT was associated<br/>especially with organs of the late baroque and classical eras. (The theorist<br/>Sorge explicitly criticized the organ builder Silbermann for this practice; on<br/>the other hand, W.A. Mozart roundly praised Silbermann&apos;s instruments).</p><p>The process of distributing the comma can continue indefinitely or in fractional<br/>variations, i.e. Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma temperament. When the comma is distributed<br/>over<br/>eleven fifths, the result is very close to 12tet (12tet actually is a<br/>redistribution of the _pythagorean_ comma over 12 fifths, see 12TET).<br/>Quarter-comma MT is closely approximated by 31tet, third-comma temperament by<br/>19tet,<br/>fifth-comma temperament by 43tet, and sixth comma temperament by 55tet.</p><p>In quarter-comma meantone, with a keyboard of 12 keys per octave, eight major<br/>triads will have just major thirds, typically the triads on Ab through A or Eb<br/>through E. It is essential to note that although these tunings were chiefly used<br/>on keyboard<br/>instruments with finite numbers of keys per octave, MTs are not intrinsically<br/>tunings with<br/>fixed numbers of pitches. The series of MT-fifths can be continued indefinitely,<br/>with each additional tone adding an additional available tonality. MT<br/>instruments with more than 12 keys per octave were not unknown. Although more<br/>frequently found in the early and middle meantone era, instruments with up to 16<br/>tones in an octave are known to have been built and played throughout the life<br/>of G.F.H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ndel.</p><p>Music in MT is notated with the standard pythagorean scheme: seven nominals or<br/>staff positions without accidentals are modified by sharps (#) as one ascends by<br/>fifths and flats (b) as one descends. This process continues indefinitely. Due<br/>to the smaller size of fifth the chromatic semitone will be smaller than the<br/>diatonic. Thus in MT c# is lower in pitch than db; the opposite relationship is<br/>heard in pythagorean tuning.</p><p>MT was the standard keyboard tuning in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The<br/>earliest recorded description of a MT tuning procedure is possibly that<br/>attributed to<br/>Pietro Aron in his _Toscanella_ (Venice, 1523). This attribution is, however,<br/>controversial, while Zarlino&apos;s description of meantone in &quot;Dimostrationi<br/>harmoniche&quot;, Venezia 1571, is not controversial. Common usage of MT or MT<br/>variants continued well into the 19th century with its final replacement by<br/>various well temperaments and 12tet occuring definitively only around 1850. MT<br/>has been widely revived for performances of early music; modern tracker organs<br/>in MT are not uncommon. Contemporary composers Gy&iuml;&iquest;&half;rgy Ligeti and Douglas Leedy<br/>have composed works in quarter-comma MT which exploit characteristic features of<br/>the tuning.</p><p>Given the pre-eminence of MT in the era when common practice tonality developed,<br/>it is useful to consider which qualities of MT were assumed by composers and<br/>positively reflected in musical repertoire.  These qualities included the purity<br/>of the major third and a good major triad; a preference for major over minor<br/>tonality (for Viennese classical music through Mozart, when minor, a preference<br/>for g); a<br/>limited range of usable tonalities (typically Eb to A); a leading tone<br/>significantly lower than that of pythagorean or 12tet; a dissonant minor<br/>seventh, requiring resolution; an augmented sixth intonationally distinct from<br/>the minor seventh (the MT augmented sixth is a good approximation of a 7:4).</p><p>More fundamental is the assumption in common practice harmony that motion by<br/>mediant intervals, thirds and sixths, can also be heard as the sum of successive<br/>perfect fifths and fourths. For example, in MT, the harmonic progression from a<br/>C major triad to an a minor triad is extremely smooth due to the common pure<br/>third c-e. It can then be complemented by a satisfactory return motion by triads<br/>related by fifths, from a to d to G to C. Inasmuch as common practice tonality<br/>can be characterized by such distinctive interaction between triads with roots<br/>related by fifths and fourths and triads with roots<br/>related by thirds or sixths, it was the compromise of MT that first provided an<br/>intonational environment in which this interaction could be realized on<br/>instruments of fixed pitch. There is astonishing agreement between the<br/>properties of MT and the requirements of common practice harmony, but a<br/>causality relationship has not been established.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=19370 href="#19370">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/24/2001 5:57:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>First off, thank you Daniel Wolf for trying hard and being generous with your<br/>time.  I for one am appreciative of your efforts.  Frankly, I&apos;m not fully<br/>sold on the FAQ idea.  Perhaps it is my difficulty with signing on to<br/>institutional definitions on this list when there is disagreement with the<br/>definitions.  I would prefer to explain myself rather than have others<br/>explain and don&apos;t feel that Paul needs to feel an obligation to respond to<br/>every question raised by a newbie.</p><p>To this end, I recognize that perceived criticism threatens to derail<br/>important feedback.  I&apos;m sure no one on this list wants to be afraid to post,<br/>or to simply register an opinion.   Since we are not in school and we are not<br/>publishing...this has nothing to do with any one person, particularly, I<br/>would like to add an education perspective.  I have been teaching people of<br/>all ages, as many on this list may have.  My only question on the informative<br/>second draft by Daniel is if by the end of the first line, one must still<br/>look up  &quot;temperament&quot; and &quot;syntonic&quot; and comma&quot; and &quot;cents&quot; and deal with<br/>numbers, there must be a better way to organize difficult material.</p><p>Since we surely have no embarrassment between us, Daniel, I want only to try<br/>something out.  Now that all the FAQs are going to Paul directly, your<br/>contribution may be the only one that allows for redirection, albeit with<br/>your willingness.  As I recall, you didn&apos;t want to change anything at the<br/>top, but maybe you will reconsider for reasons that are good ones.</p><p>WHAT IS &quot;MEANTONE&quot;</p><p>Meantone is a tuning that was developed in the Renaissance to modulate on a<br/>keyboard instrument.  Theorists devised a way to split a major third into 2<br/>equal parts (the &quot;mean&quot; whole tones) by flattening the pure fifth<br/>consistently in every key.<br/>This produces variants; quartercomma meantone splits a pure major third<br/>(ratio 5/4 or 386 cents), while sixthcomma meantone was preferred by other<br/>musicians in different times and places.</p><p>When the pure fifth (formed by the ratio of 3/2) is consistently flattened by<br/>anywhere from 2 cents to 6 cents (with 1200 cents equal to an octave), a set<br/>of identical diatonic keys are set up.  In addition to the modern keyboard<br/>setup of 12 keys per octave, meantone practitioners (like composer Michael<br/>Praetorious, 1571-1621) often favored split-key instruments.</p><p>etc.</p><p>Thank your for your attention to this.  Maybe it is too sappy above, but I<br/>hope you think it was worth the try.  I realize that there are difficult<br/>terms that still need to be looked at elsewhere, perhaps on a different FAQ.<br/>But giving help should be the overriding interest here.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=19371 href="#19371">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/24/2001 6:36:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny Reinhard wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thank your for your attention to this.

I do<br/>not, and see them as a valuable effect on Renaissance recordings with good<br/>intonation.
