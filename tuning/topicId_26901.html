Could<br/>be much more than that.</p><p>One could start a repeating section with a note ambiguous between<br/>Ab and G#, then develop from it, going to remoter parts of<br/>lattice, and never visiting the nearer regions for quite a while,<br/>so that for a considerable length of time one just doesn&apos;t have<br/>any clues to show which of the two the note is. One could play<br/>with this ambiguity too.</p><p>E.g. this plan for a short piece:</p><p>diatonic intro in C major.</p><p>Now play a single sustained G# (which will come as a &quot;surprise&quot;),<br/>and follow with diatonic section in C# major.</p><p>Or indeed, follow with pentatonic section played entirely on the black notes.<br/>Through that entire section, one doesn&apos;t yet know how the new notes<br/>fit in with the intro.</p><p>Then at the end of the first repeat, play the G# with an E (maybe<br/>as part of E major triad?), and maybe drop down to C as well after<br/>that to really anchor it and make it clear it was a G# all along.<br/>Maybe linger for a while with the C and E, and some diatonic C major,<br/>and recall the intro there.</p><p>Then, repeat the section, but this time first note played is Ab,<br/>and entire section needs to be a comma sharper. I.e., on<br/>second repeat it has been transposed up by a comma to Db major,<br/>or poss. the pentatonic scale on Db.</p><p>At end of second repeat, play the Ab in unison with C to anchor it<br/>in that way. Here the C will perhaps come as a surprise again as one will<br/>be expecting to get to it via the E as before, rather than directly. Now go off<br/>into C minor at this point, playing with the original diatonic tune in minor<br/>key (I&apos;ve just tried this out improvising, and it sounds a quite nice<br/>succession of keys). This could just be beginning of a larger piece perhaps.<br/>Or indeed could sound nice just to end it in C minor and fade away I think.</p><p>Suppose there are no comma pumps involved.</p><p>Then the leisure time adaptive tuning has a pretty clear job of it<br/>I&apos;d have thought.</p><p>The real time one has to make a decision. No reason in advance to expect the<br/>repeat to be any different from first time; that is just the composer&apos;s<br/>idea, and another composer might do it differently, and may go<br/>somewhere else altogether at the end of the section.</p><p>So supposing it makes the G# choice both times, then second time<br/>round it has to pitch slide when playing the C at the end of second<br/>repeat. If it chooses Ab both times, then it pitch slides at end<br/>of first repeat.</p><p>Okay, if one accepts pitch slides, it doesn&apos;t matter. But then it is<br/>no longer optimal adaptive tuning, and I think one can see that<br/>the leisure time retuning always has an advantage. In this case,<br/>even if one can look many bars ahead, but not to the end of the<br/>entire piece.</p><p>I think prob. one will most likely prefer the leisure time tuning<br/>of this particular piece than the real time one with a pitch slide of the<br/>G# to an Ab with the introduction of the C at the end.</p><p>Here one would have to look ahead for the entire duration of the repeat,<br/>and we have no idea how long that will be, so the leisure retuning<br/>is the only real option.</p><p>I&apos;m sure one can come up with more elaborate ones, and certainly<br/>ones that are more compositionally polished, but this is<br/>a very simple kind of example which does work, and it&apos;s easy<br/>to see exactly what is happening.</p><p>(I might even write this piece once I&apos;ve got the root channel<br/>thing programmed; kind of promising somehow).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
