(It could bne that when to sing the root after<br/>playing the chord I would sing sharp as that is the note that<br/>is being tugged most here).</p><p>Add the 960 on top, which is not so bad a 7/4 and</p><p>0-420-720-960</p><p>is a b7 chord and even a bit bluesy since the 960 is pretty<br/>close.</p><p>All this is to say, that at THIS point in my limited microtonal<br/>experience, if it isn&apos;t beat-free then there is a LOT of room<br/>for me to psychoacoustically &quot;correct&quot; things until they &quot;match&quot;<br/>with something I understand (low-liimt numbers).</p><p>And once more than two notes are sounded, all the out-of-phase<br/>beating is just a mushiness.</p><p>I was very surprised by the extent of the mushiness, for instance,<br/>a 249c interval in a scale I was interested in a</p><p>0-249-702</p><p>context (aka 0-250-700 in 24) just sounded like a<br/>&quot;really low minor third&quot;.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
