I am sure you can find some infos on internet about him as he recorded 20 CD with Al-Kindi, along with such famous singers as Sheikh Hamza Shakkur, Sabri Mudallal, Omar Sarmini, Adib Dayir, Husseyn Al Azami, Lotfi Bouchnak, Sheikh Habboush, Dogan Dikmen or Bekir Buyukbas.<br/>What is of the highest interest to us, if we want to know more about the classical arabian Maqam intonation, is that he has been designing the tuning luthery of 9 qanun prototypes based on JI variations, all in a microtonal system of his own, that ables him to be in tune with the diversity of the whole span of schools and Maqam traditions of Middle-East.<br/>In order to achieve this he has extended the usual number of Mandal-Orabs (tuning stops) of all his qanuns to 15 positions for each string, which he controls with an outstanding virtuosity. I have seen Julien in concert many times and I am always amazed by the richness of modulations he uses, in order to follow the most subtle inflexions of the music, of the singers and the other instruments.</p><p>But before I present more precisely Julien&apos;s system, let me relate a story :<br/>On the 2nd of january 2011, after they gave a concert for the new year&apos;s eve in my village, I was invited by the German &quot;ethnic jazz&quot; group Embryo on their way to Marocco, for a jam with them. Embryo are pioneer musicians in their domain, as they join with local musicians wherever they go in the world, and have a certain experience with oriental music. I knew they were fond of quartertones, and since they had mostly western instruments (trombone, sax, trumpet) except a oud, a retuned marimba and the santoor, played by Christian Burchard, I decided to make it simple, by bringing with me a banjo refretted to a JI version of Mohajira.<br/>The only problem was that my banjo was tuned around the Bayati mode (with low-type neutral tones such as 13/12, 39/32 etc. above the open strings), while their quartertones instruments were tuned on the Rast mode, with higher types of neutral thirds (128/117, 16/13, etc. above the tonic). Of course I could have simply pulled my strings up each time I would play a quartertone, but instead I prefered to take the risk to raise my open strings to the only 3 quartertones they had (half-flat Re, Mi, Si), that I choosed (mischieviously) to emphasize as the tonic notes...<br/>The musicians were a bit surprised at the beginning but they heard it was sounding good and soon we were having the most delightful time together, passing from Indonesian pelogs to Rast or Bayati in various keys, with occasional touches of Mauritanian and Malagasian music ; up till the end nobody could tell what the tonic was, and we left it unresolved.<br/>If I tell this story it is to remind us of one essential feature of Arabian music, that it has no one single sort of neutral tones, but in essence at least two distinct ones.<br/>For example if you play a traditional Bayati pentachord in D :<br/>3  3  4  4 (= quartertones)<br/>and change your tonic to C :<br/>4  3  3  4  4<br/>you may get roughly the same quartertones structure as a Rast mode, but it will not sound Rast, because the neutral third would be some kind of a 39/32 and that&apos;s simply too low for Rast&apos;s Segah.<br/>This is a basic example of why the neutral seconds, the neutral thirds etc. in the Arabic Maqam are (at least) of two types (or, if the two are&apos;nt needed together, at least of one dissymetric type).</p><p>The same necessity applies to differential coherence, as I mentioned on this list last year in several exchanges with Margo Schulter. For an optimal -c,  the neutral thirds in a chain need to be of two distinct types again : one of a &quot;11 - 9 = 2&quot; type, that generates a wholetone (here a 9/8) under the tonic, and one of the &quot;59 - 48 = 11&quot; type, that generates a neutral tone (here a 12/11) under the tonic : two types.</p><p>Some time ago Cameron explained this wonderful way to fret a 16/13 on a string, that is as old as Maqam :<br/>&gt; Drop a finger halfway between 4:3 and the nut, you&apos;ve got 8:7,<br/>&gt; drop a finger halfway between there and 4:3 and you&apos;ve got 16:13.</p><p>Likewise, if you take the aliquot point between 9/8 and 4/3 (other very basic proportions) then you have :<br/>32 + 27 / 72 of the string, or a 72/59 interval, precisely the complement in a fifth of the -c  neutral third 59/48  I just mentionned : high-limit ratios, but very old luthery practices (a division suggested by Ibn-Sina...).<br/>And between these two classical aliquot neutral thirds 72/59 and 16/13 is a 118/117 comma, that we may not want to temper in just intoned Maqam.<br/>Likewise Mohajira rational sequences, such as : 26 : 32 : 39 : 48 : 59 : 72 : 88 propose also several neutral thirds in their beginning, but will tend towards an average unique neutral third, dividing the fifth into two equal parts, such as 7 + 7 steps in a 24-edo, or 9 + 9 steps in 31-edo.<br/>These do not follow the original patterns of the classical Arabic Maqam.<br/>Mohajira also dissolves the 81/80 comma by tempering the fifth, this is not the essence of the classical Maqam either (neither Arabic nor Turkish), that is typically based on tetrachords, and pure fifths all the way (it&apos;s also pure fifths you get naturally from a ney flute, that passes from h.2 to h.3, to reach the higher tetrachord).<br/>Furthermore, the simplest harmonic neutral thirds we know, such as 11/9 or 16/13 divide a 3/2 fifth in two unequal parts.</p><p>Among other features, this distinction between at least two types of neutral thirds is a characteristic of Julien&apos;s system.<br/>Those are found inside the span of the division of an apotome (16/15 or rather 2187/2048) in 7 unequal commas, under and above each note of a Pythagorean diatonic scale : 1/1,  9/8,  81/64,  4/3,  3/2,  27/16,  243/128 (here 1/1 or the note &quot;DO&quot; of Julien&apos;s diatonic open tuning actually refers to B flat (-10 of my symetric horagram) ;<br/>in most of his tunings, these apotomes are boundered with syntonic commas and each remnant lagu (25/24) is divided in 5 smaller commas of unequal but more or less even sizes.<br/>These are Julien&apos;s qanun tuning criterias :<br/>- pure octaves<br/>- pure fifths (as a major criteria)<br/>- pure major thirds<br/>- these three leading to a frame equivalent to the 22 shrutis, extensible to 29 notes of a sequence of fifths<br/>- those are completed by a variety of JI intervals of all possible limits, in which the factor 13 is always present.</p><p>For years Julien and I have shared discussions without end about the ratios he wanted to tune his qanuns in, and about the coherence these should have together. Though he does not want to hear about temperament, I came to see that he makes very precise distinctions between the commas he wants to keep in control while playing, and the less relevant smaller variations between them. And since the basic frame of his tunings remains stable I always thought he was turning around some kind of a hidden temperament, explainable by the common structure of all his tunings.<br/>After trying several potential generators, the lower neutral second revealed to be the best one.<br/>For one thing, the &quot;3/4 tone&quot; or neutral second is an omnipresent interval in Maqam music : whether in Rast or Bayati, each have 2 of those in each tetrachord, and a whole tone.<br/>If we focus closer on the 32/27 area between 9/8 and 4/3 as it gets divided by the two traditional aliquot divisions I described before, the lower 3/4 tone between 9/8 and 72/59 is 64/59, while the higher 3/4 tone is a 13/12 and in the middle is a 118/117 comma.<br/>The difference between 13/12 and 64/59 is only 768/767, and this small dissymmetry certainly can be tempered.<br/>By chance, if you divide a pure fifth in 5 equal parts you will get an interval of 1.084471771 or 140.391 c., that falls in between 13/12 and 64/59 : I think you now get the idea of my temperament...</p><p>You may have a better vision of it by opening the file &quot;Tsaharuk.jpg&quot; in my TL folder.<br/>There are two ways to arrive to this structure of 12 lagus (each divided in five small commas), and separated by 17 syntonic commas evenly distributed.<br/>A convenient way is to go through a planar temperament using such a generator of one 1/5 of a fifth, and a complementary generator of a pure or quasi-pure 5/4.<br/>Or, the same structure can be attained by a linear temperament using the first generator only, knowing that 40 generators (or 8 fifths just like in any schismatic temperament) lead to the equivalent of a 128/5 ratio : when using 8 fourths minus 3 octaves as a major third in the planar version, both are equivalent.<br/>In both cases the fifth acts in practice as an extra-periodic interval.<br/>So Tsaharuk in its linear version tempers 32805/32768, and knowing this feature it suggests that the 1/5 of a POTE L-5 schismatic temperament could be a solution for a generator (approximated by 244/225) in favor of harmonic 5.<br/>However, between the best values that can be found for h. 3 and 5, Tsaharuk proposes also a very precise resolution of harmonic 7, after 24 generators, that raises the optimal solutions for h 3, 5 , 7 altogether a little higher, and closer to Julien&apos;s criterias.<br/>Using exactly one 1/24th of a (7:1) as a generator is another solution, itself very close to the algebraic solution of  x^24 = 2x^5 + 4    (x = 1.084455776530908 = 140.3654663448 c., giving a fifth of 701.827331724 c.)  that offers more rigorous -c  7/4 intervals, and triple equal-beating properties.<br/>Not far from this area is a found a Meta-temperament version of Tsaharuk (showing perfectly self-similar interval patterns) when the generator size is 2/ (12 + sqrt(26)) of one octave, or 140.3589251 c.</p><p>Any of those generators, close enough to one 1/5 of a pure fifth leads to a main DE scale of 77 notes, that can be extended further to reach Julien JW&apos;s full qanun tuning (105 notes or a little less in pratice). Here are some JI approximations of the first intervals generated :</p><p>(0 = 1/1)<br/>1  ~  13/12,  1024/945,  64/59,  243/224<br/>2  ~  20/17,  153/130,  207/176<br/>3 ~  14/11,  51/40,  88/69<br/>4 ~  18/13,  112/81, 177/128<br/>5 ~  3/2<br/>6 ~ 13/8,  512/315,  96/59, etc.</p><p>As the mapping for the first harmonics (3  5  7  11  13  17  19  23  29) is :  (5  -40  24  21  6  -42  -15  13  33),<br/>the larger neutral 2th is attained by -16 generators, which considers these ratios as variations :<br/>12/11,  130/119,  153/140,  59/54,  176/161,  35/32,  128/117, etc.<br/>Which means that Tsaharuk also tempers 4096/4095,  3520/3519,  2601/2600,  2185/2184,  1521/1520,  945/944,  833/832,  768/767,  729/728,  561/560,  484/483, etc., along with 385/384,  378/377,  352/351.<br/>The harmonic suite 116:117:118:119:120 is equal in Tsaharuk and lets you figurate some more of the commas it dissolves.</p><p>A few other approximations :<br/>-17 ~ 81/80<br/>10 ~  9/8<br/>-15 ~  32/27<br/>11 ~  39/32<br/>-6 ~  16/13<br/>-23 ~  119/96 (a useful and fairly good Turkish low major 3rd)<br/>20 ~  81/64,  224/177<br/>-5 ~  4/3<br/>21 ~  351/256<br/>-13 ~  39/28<br/>-4 ~  13/9<br/>-25  ~ 256/243,  59/56, etc.</p><p>And a basic mapping for a Bayati in C = 0 for those who want to test it :<br/>0  1  -15  -5   5   6  -10<br/>along with variations for Rast in Bb (= -10) : -16  -11</p><p>The &quot;parametric&quot; horagram representation I used for my octave wheel shows the developpement of the temperament in a 77 notes DE, but along with a radial micromodulation of the generator, resulting into a continuous variation of structure.<br/>The outer rings pass by several edos but for more clarity I reported only three of them, in the most pertinent zone close to pure fifths : 77-edo, 171-edo, 94-edo, with respectiveley 9, 20, 11 steps for the generator.<br/>The 94-edo is the only one with fifths larger than 3/2 ; a recurrent sequence such as x^29 = 4x^6 + 4 provides such a cycle, with x = 1.0844858376952085 = 140.4134555676 c., and a fifth of 702.067277838 c.<br/>One interesting circle between 171 and 94 would be a 359-edo (with 42 steps for the generator) as it&apos;s near to it we find the purest fifths, while the best h.13 is found beyond the 77-edo ring (that would reduce to a 60-edo at some point) ; the 60-edo ring is not represented here but we can figure easily where it would be situated, passing by the crossing of the lines extended after 17 and -17 (BTW 4x^6 = x^5 + 5   (x = 1.0842367808 = 140.01582452796 c.), or x^19 = x^15 + 1,  (x = 1.084180083774 = 139.925292225 c.) are correct algebraic solutions for &quot;Bleu&quot;, and the last one should be a fun sequence maker).</p><p>As a conclusion, while Tsaharuk as a temperament does not offer the simplicity of a Mohajira or a Buzurg (a temperament for Persian music I described some time ago), as a 7-limit schismatic micro-temperament integrating realistic neutral intervals it proposes a range of tunings for Arabic Maqam (as well as for Turkish Maqam to a certain extent), leading to scale structures that have been demonstrated by Julien Jalaleddine Weiss as completely relevant to Maqam music.<br/>I hope this humble contribution will motivate some of you to discover new oriental flavors, to experiment with Maqam scales and tunings and perhaps to learn more about one of the world&apos;s richest musical treasures of all times.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=100746 href="#100746">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2011 1:21:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[This is the first part of a two-part reply, with the second<br/>part to be posted immediately after this one.

I am sure you can find some infos on<br/>&gt; internet about him as he&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;recorded 20 CD with&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;Al-Kindi, along<br/>&gt; with such famous singers as&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;Sheikh Hamza Shakkur,&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;Sabri<br/>&gt; Mudallal, Omar Sarmini,&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;Adib Dayir,&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;Husseyn Al Azami,&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;Lotfi<br/>&gt; Bouchnak, Sheikh Habboush, Dogan Dikmen or Bekir Buyukbas.&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;</p><p>Indeed I would imagine that to hear such an ensemble would be<br/>like hearing the music at St. Mark&apos;s Cathedral in Venice in the<br/>time of Giovanni Gabrieli, an experience related by a visitor<br/>from England, Fynes Moryson.</p><p>And this should be an occasion at once of joy for you, to have<br/>the benefit of sharing in and learning from such consummate<br/>mastery, and of humility for me, to remember that my concepts of<br/>maqam music must quite literally be &quot;outlandish,&quot; since I have<br/>not had the benefit of such sound and able tuition.</p><p>&gt; What is of the highest interest to us, if we want to know more<br/>&gt; about the classical arabian Maqam intonation, is that he has<br/>&gt; been designing the tuning luthery of 9 qanun prototypes based<br/>&gt; on JI variations, all in a microtonal system of his own, that<br/>&gt; ables him to be in tune with the diversity of the whole span of<br/>&gt; schools and Maqam traditions of Middle-East.</p><p>Indeed this seems like the &quot;universal Maqam instrument&quot; to which<br/>some musicians of the Middle East have aspired from time to<br/>time. And for those of us who may design and use less perfect and<br/>universal tuning systems also, your account is an invaluable<br/>guide as to what is possible, and may be realized in some small<br/>part in more modest systems also.</p><p>&gt; In order to achieve this he has extended the usual number of<br/>&gt; Mandal-Orabs (tuning stops) of all his qanuns to 15 positions<br/>&gt; for each string, which he controls with an outstanding<br/>&gt; virtuosity. I have seen Julien in concert many times and I am<br/>&gt; always amazed by the richness of modulations he uses, in order<br/>&gt; to follow the most subtle inflexions of the music, of the<br/>&gt; singers and the other instruments.</p><p>Here I might comment that the modest problem to which I have<br/>given almost my attention is the tuning of a solo keyboard<br/>instrument, an electronic synthesizer in 1024-EDO as it happens,<br/>where no other instruments or performers are involved, and so<br/>many of fine points and subtleties of practical ensemble playing<br/>which have shaped Julien&apos;s system do not come into the question.<br/>Yet the desire for intonational variety, flexibility, and choice<br/>which is central to the highest level of _tarab_ (&quot;ecstasy&quot; or<br/>&quot;enchantment&quot;) in maqam performance, may be realized to some<br/>degree even in such modest systems.</p><p>At this point I should duly apologize for the fact that, reading<br/>such a magnificent letter as yours, I find that any fitting reply<br/>attempting a similar scope would at once become longer than even<br/>I might care to post &lt;grin&gt;, and on many points would go beyond<br/>my knowledge and experience.</p><p>Yet there are a few points on which I might comment. The first is<br/>your delightful discussion of Rast and Bayyati, which invites a<br/>due recognition of the most noble Mustaqim of Ibn Sina, which<br/>among the Arabs is sometimes styled Rast Jadid or &quot;New Rast.&quot;<br/>It might also be of interest here to show how the fine nuance in<br/>the placement of the step Segah (Arabic Sikah) for these maqamat<br/>may sometimes be addressed, albeit imperfectly, on a 24-note<br/>keyboard.</p><p>The second concerns the comma between the smaller and larger size<br/>of neutral or Zalzalian second in certain divisions -- for<br/>example, 64/59 and 128/117 in your example with a difference or<br/>comma at 118/117. This raises some fine questions which might<br/>apply to either just or tempered tuning.</p><p>The third is a fascinating passage in your letter mentioning the<br/>division of a &quot;remnant lagu&quot; (25/24) into &quot;5 smaller commas of<br/>unequal but more or less even sizes.&quot; Here I shall propose one<br/>interpretation of these five commas related to the four ratios<br/>for superparticular neutral seconds -- 14:13, 13:12, 12:11, and<br/>11:10 -- and show how, in some tempered systems used for maqam or<br/>dastgah music, the commas between these ratios may be represented<br/>imperfectly but still more or less accurately by aliquot<br/>logarithmic parts. And such divisions, of course, should not be<br/>confused with the most noble aliquot divisions one make on a<br/>monochord or fretboard and to which you rightly  give place of<br/>honor in your discourse, as 16:14:13:12 or 72:64:59:54.</p><p>As it happens, I find that the exposition of even this ground<br/>requires a reply broken into parts, of which this is the first.</p><p>             *              *              *</p><p>Before delving into these points, I would take care to say that<br/>the majesty and excellence of the music and tuning you describe<br/>go far beyond such points, which at most may perhaps illustrate a<br/>freedom, accuracy, and flexibility for which we all may strive.</p><p>Your brief summary of Julien&apos;s criteria for tuning the qanun<br/>might itself inspire many voluminous treatises, and while some<br/>might quibble over details of regional taste here and there, I<br/>must conclude that he and his colleagues have set a standard for<br/>those of us pursuing more modest or limited goals at once to<br/>admire and to emulate at least in part.</p><p>Let me briefly add something about the role of ratios, which you<br/>and I alike find a natural language for discussing not only just<br/>intonation but also tempered systems. What I would like to<br/>emphasize is that some of the best Middle Eastern musicians and<br/>theorists such as Amine Beyhom, Ali Jihad Racy, Hormoz Farhat,<br/>and Dariush Tala&grave;i do not dwell much on ratios, but are very<br/>concerned indeed with artful maqam intonation, including, of<br/>course, the use of unequal neutral second steps. And scholars<br/>from other parts of the world such as Scott Marcus, likewise, use<br/>values in cents (or sometimes, as with Racy, in 53-commas) to<br/>document the &quot;understanding&quot; of traditional performers in Egypt,<br/>for example, as to the higher or lower placement of certain<br/>neutral steps and intervals.</p><p>Myself, I am an unapologetic lover of ratios, but must admit also<br/>to resorting to temperament, with your wise discussion as to some<br/>commas perhaps being more essential than others in a given style<br/>as one fine starting point for a fuller discussion. Here,<br/>however, I shall seek to focus mainly on the aforementioned three<br/>points.</p><p>----------------------<br/>1. Of Rast and Bayyati<br/>----------------------</p><p>There could be no better beginning on this point than to quote<br/>from your most delightful story of your encounter with a German<br/>&quot;ethnic jazz&quot; group called Embryo in your village two days after<br/>they have given a New Years&apos; Eve concert:</p><p>&gt; The only problem was that my banjo was tuned around the Bayati<br/>&gt; mode (with low-type neutral tones such as 13/12, 39/32<br/>&gt; etc. above the open strings), while their quartertones<br/>&gt; instruments were tuned on the Rast mode, with higher types of<br/>&gt; neutral thirds (128/117, 16/13, etc. above the tonic). Of<br/>&gt; course I could have simply pulled my strings up each time I<br/>&gt; would play a quartertone, but instead I prefered to take the<br/>&gt; risk to raise my open strings to the only 3 quartertones they<br/>&gt; had (half-flat Re, Mi, Si), that I choosed (mischieviously) to<br/>&gt; emphasize as the tonic notes...</p><p>One small detail is that, for Rast on Ut, I might have also<br/>desired a half-flat La for the neutral sixth step of conjunct<br/>Rast, placed by al-Farabi (not yet under the name of Rast) at<br/>18/11; or at 64/39 to match a 16/13 third at rast-segah, for<br/>example (assuming pure fourths). However, it may be that this<br/>neutral sixth is not so commonly used by all performers, some of<br/>them possibly keeping La unchanged (27/16 or whatever) while<br/>placing Si half-flat (e.g. 81/44 or 24/13) when ascending and<br/>Si-b (e.g. 16/9) when descending, for the most part.</p><p>&gt; The musicians were a bit surprised at the beginning but they<br/>&gt; heard it was sounding good and soon we were having the most<br/>&gt; delightful time together, passing from Indonesian pelogs to<br/>&gt; Rast or Bayati in various keys, with&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;occasional&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;touches of<br/>&gt; Mauritanian and Malagasian music ; up till the end nobody could<br/>&gt; tell what the tonic was, and we left it unresolved.</p><p>This must have been a joy to hear, but a yet greater joy to<br/>play.</p><p>&gt; If I tell this story it is to remind us of one essential<br/>&gt; feature of Arabian music, that it has no one single sort of<br/>&gt; neutral tones, but in essence at least two distinct ones.&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;</p><p>A vital point which you well make is that while a tuning system<br/>as impressive as Julien&apos;s follows this rule, so does the more<br/>modest system of a 17-note Persian tar or setar, for example, or<br/>even the more limited gamut of the santur which generally has<br/>fewer than 12 notes per octave.</p><p>&gt; For example if you play a traditional Bayati pentachord in D :<br/>&gt; 3 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;3 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;4 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;4 (= quartertones)<br/>&gt; and change your tonic to C :<br/>&gt; 4 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;3 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;3 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;4 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;4</p><p>&gt; you may get roughly the same quartertones structure as a<br/>&gt; Rast&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;mode, but it will not sound Rast, because the neutral<br/>&gt; third would be some kind of a 39/32 and that&apos;s simply too low<br/>&gt; for Rast&apos;s Segah.</p><p>One way sometimes used by Arab theorists to illustrate this point<br/>is by counting the intervals in approximate commas -- not as an<br/>exact measure, but to show which neutral steps are understood as<br/>larger or smaller. And it may be done by ratios or cents also.</p><p>Here there are actually four possibilities, each of which has<br/>musical charm and value, but two of which indeed define the<br/>favored tunings for Rast and Bayyati. Thus let us begin, as in<br/>your example, with Bayyati, and then add a step at an exact or<br/>approximate 9:8 tone below, producing a maqam somewhat different<br/>from a modern Arab or Turkish Rast, although beautiful:</p><p>Here the ASCII accidental &quot;d&quot; signifies a half-flat, and &quot;+&quot; a<br/>half-sharp:</p><p>Bayyati:</p><p>          dugah   segah chargah neva  huseyni<br/>            D      E-d    F       G      A<br/>            Re    Mi-d    Fa     Sol     La<br/> Quarters:  0      3      6      10      14<br/>               3      3      4       4</p><p> 53-commas: 0      6     13      22      31<br/>               6      7      9       9</p><p> ratios:   1/1   13/12  32/27    4/3     3/2<br/> cents:     0     139    294     498     702<br/>             13:12  128:117  9:8     9:8<br/>              139     155    204     204</p><p>Here, while 24-step notation tells us that there are two neutral<br/>seconds followed by two usual tones, 3-3-4-4, any of the other<br/>notations shows that the first neutral second step is smaller<br/>than the second in a stylish Bayyati. I have chosen the ratios<br/>mentioned in your story, but rounded cents of the kind used by<br/>Farhat or Beyhom would make the same point: say, for example,<br/>that the steps are 140-155-205-200 cents.</p><p>&gt; and change your tonic to C :<br/>&gt; 4 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;3 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;3 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;4 &iuml;&iquest;&oelig;4</p><p>&gt; you may get roughly the same quartertones structure as a<br/>&gt; Rast&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;mode, but it will not sound Rast, because the neutral<br/>&gt; third would be some kind of a 39/32 and that&apos;s simply too low<br/>&gt; for Rast&apos;s Segah.</p><p>Mustaqim:</p><p>           rast  dugah  segah chargah neva<br/>            C      D     E-d    F       G<br/>            Ut     Re   Mi-d    Fa     Sol<br/> Quarters:  0      4      7     10      14<br/>               4      3      3       4</p><p> 53-commas: 0      9     15     22      31<br/>               9      6      7       9</p><p> ratios:   1/1    9/8   39/32    4/3     3/2<br/> cents:     0     204    342     498     702<br/>              9:8   13:12  128:117   9:8<br/>              204    139    155      204</p><p>Here we have a usual 9:8 tone from rast to dugah, plus the 13:12<br/>step at dugah-segah so excellent for Bayyati, arriving at a<br/>rast-segah interval of 39/32 -- exactly what Ibn Sina called for<br/>in his description of a mode called Mustaqim, Arabic for the<br/>&quot;true, correct, or regular&quot; mode, a meaning likewise signified by<br/>the Persian name Rast.</p><p>This beautiful mode may be heard today in some of the Persian<br/>gushe-ha, or modal themes which make up the dastgah-ha or modal<br/>families, although it does not seem to be recognized as a dastgah<br/>or avaz (satellite dastgah) in itself. The gushe of Mahur Dastgah<br/>called Shekaste may give one of the best examples. And the<br/>beautiful Mustaqim tetrachord may also be found, for example, on<br/>the fourth step of your Ibina.</p><p>However, as you emphasize, 39/32 is simply not high enough for a<br/>stylish Arab or Turkish Rast, with al-Farabi&apos;s 27/22 (355 cents)<br/>or Beyhom&apos;s 200-155-145 cents for a typical modern Lebanese Rast<br/>(with rast-segah at around 355 cents, very close to al-Farabi) as<br/>a guide for a low or moderate tuning.</p><p>Thus, as Scott Marcus sums things up, segah must be higher for<br/>Rast than for Bayyati; and as your story suggests, as well as a<br/>detail of Beyhom&apos;s suggestions as to modern Lebanese tunings,<br/>musicians not able or inclined to make this distinction will tend<br/>to favor the steps of Rast.</p><p>Rast:</p><p>           rast  dugah  segah chargah neva<br/>            C      D     E-d    F        G<br/>            Ut     Re   Mi-d    Fa      Sol<br/> Quarters:  0      4      7     10       14<br/>               4      3      3       4</p><p> 53-commas: 0      9     16     22       31<br/>               9      7      6       9</p><p> ratios:   1/1    9/8   16/13    4/3     3/2<br/> cents:     0     204    359     498     702<br/>              9:8  128:117  13:12    9:8<br/>              204    155     204     204</p><p>An advantage of rast-segah at 16/13 is that it should be pleasing<br/>in many Arab localities, and at the same time high enough to<br/>qualify as a correct if &quot;low&quot; Turkish Rast, as Ozan Yarman has<br/>said.</p><p>Now let us assume that a fixed-pitch instrument with only one<br/>step to represent segah has been tuned for Rast, and is now used<br/>to play in Bayyati. We thus have:</p><p>High Bayyati (or Huseyni):</p><p>          dugah  segah chargah  neva   huseyni<br/>            D     E-d    F       G        A<br/>            Re   Mi-d    Fa     Sol       La<br/> Quarters:  0      3     6      10       14<br/>               3      3      4       4</p><p> 53-commas: 0      7     13     22       31<br/>               7      6      9       9</p><p> ratios:   1/1  128/117 32/27    4/3     3/2<br/> cents:     0     155    294     498     702<br/>            128:117  13:12   9:8     9:8<br/>              155     139    204     204</p><p>Indeed some distinguished Arab musicians have accepted, or at<br/>least resigned themselves to this high neutral second at<br/>dugah-segah in Maqam Bayyati, so that the Syrian musician Tawfiq<br/>al-Sabbagh, for example, gives this tetrachord as 7-6-9 commas,<br/>although another Syrian source as well as the experience of<br/>Beyhom and Marcus in other parts of the Arab world would favor a<br/>notation of 6-7-9 commas. And the intent of such 53-comma<br/>notation is often not to specify any exact tuning (read<br/>literally, around 158-136-204 cents or 136-158-204 cents), but to<br/>indicate the ordering of the unequal neutral seconds, with the<br/>smallest placed below (6-7-9 commas) -- in contrast to Rast<br/>(9-7-6 commas) where the larger neutral second precedes the<br/>smaller.</p><p>However, while it may be less than ideal for Bayyati, 7-6-9<br/>commas or the like is a beautiful intonation for Maqam Huseyni,<br/>which might call for a more bright or outgoing quality, or for<br/>one shading of Turkish Ushshaq.</p><p>Now it is not necessarily a flaw of the 24-step notation that it<br/>does not specify the intonational details of which neutral<br/>seconds are larger or smaller -- as long as we understand that it<br/>is best used as merely a guide to the general types of intervals<br/>(e.g. major, minor, and neutral seconds), as likewise with a<br/>notation such as that of Safi al-Din al-Urmawi in the 13th<br/>century based on 17 steps to the octave, which Beyhom has come to<br/>favor as preferable to 24.</p><p>As Beyhom emphasizes, having used both the 24-step and 17-step<br/>notations, they merely define moveable steps or &quot;locations,&quot; and<br/>certainly need not imply an _equal_ spacing of these steps!</p><p>What I urge is that while the proper patterns of modern Rast and<br/>Bayyati (approximately 9-7-6 and 6-7-9 commas) may be most<br/>familiar, Mustaqim or Rast Jadid (9-6-7) and a high Arab Huseyni<br/>(7-6-9) should also be deliberately cultivated rather than fallen<br/>into mainly by mistake or inertia.</p><p>If any may desire a &quot;ratio-unromantic&quot; accounting of these four<br/>tunings in a nutshell, and using the same step sizes in rounded<br/>cents for each, with a 500-cent fourth and a 155-145 division of<br/>a 300-cent third (as in Beyhom&apos;s estimate for a Lebanese Rast),<br/>then we have:</p><p>Arrangement for D Bayyati or C Mustaqim</p><p>              0     200   345   500   700<br/>              ut     re   mi-d   fa   sol<br/>             (C)     D     Ed     F     G<br/>                (200)  145   155   200</p><p>Arrangement for D Huseyni or C Rast<br/>(sometimes used for high D Bayyati)</p><p>              0     200   355   500   700<br/>              ut     re   mi-d   fa   sol<br/>             (C)     D     Ed     F     G<br/>                (200)  155   145   200</p><p>Let it be added that the reality is much more subtle, with<br/>Beyhom&apos;s estimated position for Ed in a &quot;popular&quot; Lebanese<br/>Bayyati being around 130 cents above D rather than the 145 cents<br/>we would get simply by reversing the order of steps in his Rast.<br/>His account of an &quot;academic&quot; or &quot;learned&quot; (_musique savante_)<br/>Bayyati, if I correctly understand the French, reports a<br/>placement at 155 cents, from which we might infer that persons of<br/>this school leave the accustomed position of segah in Rast<br/>unchanged for Bayyati. Your own merry tale of playing with the<br/>group Embryo might suggest this possibility.</p><p>&gt; This is a basic example of why the neutral seconds, the neutral<br/>&gt; thirds etc. in the Arabic Maqam are (at least) of two types<br/>&gt; (or, if the two are&apos;nt needed together, at least of one<br/>&gt; dissymetric type).</p><p>Ideally, of course, on a qanon for example, one might simply have<br/>two locations for segah, say at 39/32 above rast for Bayyati, and<br/>16/13 above it for Rast. However, on a keyboard in the O3 tuning,<br/>there are some interesting situations revealing both the<br/>possibilities and manifest imperfections of this tuning.</p><p>Suppose, for example, we wish to have both a higher segah for<br/>Rast and a lower one for Bayyati -- by reference to the same 1/1<br/>or rast step, that is! One possibility would be to choose F* on<br/>the upper keyboard as our rast or 1/1:</p><p>    F*     G*     A    Bb*     C*     D*     E    F*<br/>    0    207.4  358.6 496.9  704.3  911.7 1061.7 1200<br/>     207,4  151.2  138.2  207.4  207.4 150.0  138.2</p><p>Here each Rast tetrachord is very close to 39:44:48:52, with F*-A<br/>at not quite a cent narrow of 16/13. For Bayyati on our dugah<br/>step, G*, we use G#* rather than A as segah:</p><p>                                 Eb*<br/>                                785.2<br/>    G*   G#*    Bb*     C*    D*     E     F*    G*<br/>    0   127.7  289.5  496.9  704.3  854.3 992.6  1200<br/>     127,7 161.7  207.4  207.4 150.0  138.2  207.4</p><p>Now we have dugah-segah at 127.7 cents, very close to 14/13,<br/>which may a bit low for Egyptian tastes (Marcus suggests 135-145<br/>cents or so), but more congenial to popular Lebanese tastes,<br/>favoring according to Beyhom a step of around 130 cents.</p><p>A fine point that is that while the minor sixth is the usual step<br/>above the final of Beyhom, here at 785.2 cents, or between 11/7<br/>and 52/33, the neutral sixth at E is at 854.3 cents, very close<br/>to 18/11, and much higher than a 3:2 fifth above our low segah<br/>would produce! Marcus reports an &quot;understanding&quot; among<br/>traditional Egyptian performers that this neutral sixth degree<br/>should be somewhat higher than 850 cents, just as the neutral<br/>second step should be somewhat lower than 150 cents. And it is<br/>interesting that the mostly corresponding Turkish Maqam Ushshaq,<br/>as measured from recorded performances of esteemed artists by<br/>Baris Bozkurt and others including Can Akkoc and Ozan Yarman,<br/>should show a low neutral second peaking in the region of around<br/>130-142 cents, but a very high neutral sixth (or small major<br/>sixth) peaking at around 872 cents!</p><p>For a Turkish Rast with a high neutral or submajor third around<br/>26/21, one favorite location is B on the lower keyboard, and here<br/>we may obtain a moderate Arab Bayyati with steps very close to<br/>13:12 and 12:11.</p><p>   B    C#    Eb    E     F#    G#     Bb    B<br/>   0  207.4 369.1  495.7 703.1 911.7 1073.4 1200<br/>   207.4 161.7 126.6  207.4 208.6 161.7  126.6</p><p>This Rast, quite high by most Arab standards although moderate in<br/>a Turkish context where segah may often approach a ratio of 5/4,<br/>includes large and small neutral seconds of around 11:10 and<br/>14:13 which also nicely serve a Turkish Huseyni. For an Arab<br/>Bayyati (or Turkish Ushshaq or Arazbar), however, a lower segah<br/>at D* is used:</p><p>                            784.0<br/>                              A<br/>   C#   D*    E     F#    G#     Bb    B     C#<br/>   0  138.3 288.3  495.7 704.3 866.0 992.6 1200<br/>   138.3 150.0  207.4 208.6 161.7 126.6  207.4</p><p>The Bayyati tetrachord at 138.3-150.0-207.4 cents is very close<br/>to a division of 52:48:44:39, the lower minor third receiving an<br/>aliquot arithmetic division on monochord of 13:12:11.</p><p>One question of taste is whether, in an Arab Bayyati, to use the<br/>high neutral sixth step Bb at 864.8 cents (between 28/17 and<br/>104/63, for example), or the lower neutral sixth A* at 842.6<br/>cents. The first choice might be a bit bright for an ideal<br/>Bayyati in some parts of the Arab world, although fine for a<br/>Turkish Ushshaq or Huseyni; while the second would disregard the<br/>understanding reported by Marcus that the neutral sixth should be<br/>rather more than a perfect fifth above segah.</p><p>In these examples, the steps rast and dugah have remained fixed,<br/>while segah takes a higher position for Rast and a lower one for<br/>Bayyati. A different solution offers itself if we place Rast at<br/>G* on the upper keyboard, where a usual Arab Rast is to be<br/>obtained:</p><p>    G*     A*     B     C*     D*     E*     F    G*<br/>    0    207.4  358.6 496.9  704.3  911.7 1061.7 1200<br/>     208.6  150.0  138.2  207.4  207.4 150.0  138.2</p><p>To obtain a low Bayyati, we keep B as segah, but shift the second<br/>step dugah of Rast from A* at 207.4 cents to Bb at 230.9 cents, a<br/>comma higher (a virtually just 8/7), and use this as the tonic or<br/>final of Bayyati!</p><p>                                    F*<br/>                                  760.5<br/>    Bb     B      C*      Eb     F     F#     G*     Bb<br/>    0    126.6   264.8  495.7  703.1  829.7  968.0  1200<br/>     126.6   138.3  230.9   207.4  126.6  138.3  232.0</p><p>This septimal flavor of Bayyati might fit the observation made to<br/>Marcus by Racy, with a demonstration on a fretted instrument,<br/>that the minor third is lower than that produced by strings tuned<br/>in pure 4:3 fourths at 32/27. One consequence here is a<br/>commitment to an impressively low regular minor sixth step at<br/>760.5 cents (near 273/176, by comparison to 14/9 at 764.9 cents),<br/>and to a low neutral sixth at 829.7 cents near 21/13, the higher<br/>position favored in much Arab and Turkish practice not being<br/>available at this location.

And now to your<br/>comma of 118/117:</p><p>&gt; And between these two classical aliquot neutral thirds 72/59<br/>&gt; and 16/13 is a 118/117 comma, that we may not want to&iuml;&iquest;&oelig;temper<br/>&gt; in just intoned Maqam.</p><p>Here I might imagine, for example, a qanun tuned so as to support<br/>some steps like this -- not a complete tuning, but merely an<br/>example of how this comma might arise:</p><p>                                                  59:48<br/>                                        |-----------------------|<br/>             9/8   8/7   7/6  32/27   72/59<br/>    |--------------------------------------|--------------------|<br/>   1/1                                   16/13      4/3        3/2<br/>                                           |--------------------|<br/>                                                   39:32</p><p>Here there is one neutral third at 72/59, and another at 16/13,<br/>both in relation to the 1/1 or rast. As you observe, between<br/>these notes there is a comma of 118:117 or 14.734 cents, let us<br/>say about two-thirds of a comma.</p><p>Now these two thirds with respect to rast give rise to two others<br/>of slightly different size. For example, suppose that we begin on<br/>the 16/13 location of segah apt for an Arab or Turkish Rast, and<br/>play in Maqam Segah (or Maqam Sikah as it is known in Arabic),<br/>with 16/13-4/3-3/2 as our first trichord. Now between 16/13 and<br/>4/3 we have a neutral third at 39:32, a favorite of Ibn Sina.</p><p>And suppose that playing in a Persian manner, we use the lower<br/>position of segah at 72/59, and play Dastgah-e Segah, with a<br/>tetrachord above this final of 72/59-4/3-3/2-96/59. Between 72/59<br/>and 3/2 we have a third at 59:48.</p><p>If we use pure fifths and fourths, as I understand that Julien<br/>does, then while 118:117 or not quite 15 cents will measure the<br/>space between the 72/59 and 16/13 steps, we shall have some<br/>additional commas expressing the difference in the sizes of a<br/>pair of neutral thirds (e.g. 39:32 and 16:13, or 72:59 and 59:48)<br/>together making up a 3:2 fifth.</p><p>Thus with Ibn Sina&apos;s 39:32 and 16:13, we have a difference of<br/>512:507, or 16.990 cents, close to 3/4 of a comma. And these<br/>sizes might be taken roughly to mark the lower and upper borders<br/>of the realm of &quot;central neutral thirds,&quot; since neighboring<br/>ratios substantially smaller or larger might instead be called<br/>supraminor or submajor thirds (e.g. 40/33 at 333 cents, or 26/21<br/>at 370 cents).</p><p>Now with the 72:59 and 59:48 thirds brought about by the<br/>arithmetic division which he mentions and Safi al-Din recommends,<br/>the difference is 3481:3456 or 12.478 cents, slightly more than<br/>half of a Pythagorean comma (23.460 cents) or equal Holderian<br/>53-comma (22.642 cents).</p><p>With al-Farabi&apos;s neutral thirds at 11:9 and 27:22, the difference<br/>is a smaller 243:242 or 7.139 cents, or roughly 1/3 comma. Amine<br/>Beyhom&apos;s rounded approximation for a modern Lebanese Rast with<br/>steps of 200-155-145 cents, and thus thirds at 345 and 355 cents,<br/>has a comparable difference of about 10 cents.</p><p>On a justly tuned instrument such as I picture schematically<br/>above, there might be both a 72/59 step and 16/13 step. In a<br/>tuning system such as O3, however, we find some important commas<br/>or differences which may not occur on the keyboard as direct<br/>steps -- unlike the 118:117 step as imagined above.</p><p>For example, in O3 we find thirds at 345.7 cents (e.g. C-Eb*) and<br/>357.4 cents (e.g. D*-F#), quite close to 72:59 and 59:48 at 344.7<br/>and 357.2 cents. Here the comma is about 11.719 cents -- or almost<br/>exactly half a Pythagorean comma, as compared to 12.478 cents for<br/>the just 72:59 and 59:48.</p><p>In O3, however, there is no direct step on the keyboard<br/>representing this comma -- indeed, the smallest is a full comma<br/>of 20 tuning steps in 1024-EDO, or 23.4375 cents. Thus it is not<br/>possible to obtain thirds at both 345.7 and 357.4 cents above the<br/>same note -- for example, the step we choose as rast, where these<br/>values might nicely serve respectively an Arab Bayyati and an<br/>Arab Rast. Rather, at best, we may find 345.7 cents and 369.1<br/>cents (an Arab Bayyati but more of a bright Turkish Rast), or<br/>334.0 cents and 357.4 cents (a low Bayyati by at least some Arab<br/>tastes, although a characteristic Rast).</p><p>In this kind of limited system, one makes intonational choices in<br/>good part by moving around the keyboard and deciding where one<br/>will notionally place rast or the gamut as a whole for a given<br/>piece or improvisation. There is variety, but not necessarily a<br/>high degree of consistency or congruity!</p><p>However, whatever the scope of the system, I believe that the<br/>comma or difference in sizes between two neutral thirds together<br/>forming a fifth is one important parameter of style and taste.<br/>Thus we have the quite subtle contrast of al-Farabi&apos;s 27/22 and<br/>11/9, the somewhat greater contrast of Ibn Sina&apos;s 39/32 and<br/>16/13, representing shadings still much relished in Arab music,<br/>and sometimes in Persian and Turkish styles as well.</p><p>Other traditional tetrachords, such as Safi al-Din&apos;s &quot;Medium<br/>Sundered&quot; at 9:8-11:10-320:297 (204-165-129 cents), represent a<br/>more pronounced degree of contrast where we may speak of submajor<br/>and supraminor thirds, a shading which may occur in parts of the<br/>Arab world but seems most characteristic, perhaps, of Turkish and<br/>Persian music. Thus in Safi al-Din&apos;s tetrachord, extended to a<br/>pentachord 1/1-9/8-99/80-4/3-3/2, we have a large 99:80 or<br/>submajor third at 368.9 cents, and a smaller 40:33 or supraminor<br/>third at 333.0 cents -- a difference of 3267/3200 or 35.873<br/>cents, about 1.5 commas (Pythagorean or Holderian), and more like<br/>a small diesis (compare the smaller diesis step on an<br/>archicembalo in 1/4-comma meantone at 34.99 cents, which together<br/>with the more familiar diesis at 128:125 or 41.06 cents makes up<br/>a minor semitone at 76.05 cents).</p><p>From this it also follows that when a Middle Eastern theorist<br/>speaks of a tetrachord of Rast being 9-7-6 commas, or of Bayyati<br/>as 6-7-9 commas, typically no exact measurement, much less<br/>prescription, is intended. Rather the main purpose is to show the<br/>general types of steps and intervals, and the ordering of larger<br/>and smaller neutral second steps.</p><p>Thus a &quot;9-7-6&quot; Rast in many parts of the Arab world might have<br/>neutral second steps differing by much less than a Holderian<br/>comma. as with al-Farabi&apos;s steps of 12:11 and 88:81; or in Turkey<br/>by rather more, as with Safi al-Din&apos;s steps of 11:10 and 320:297.<br/>Indeed, in Turkey, the contrast may become so great that the<br/>notation changes to &quot;9-8-5,&quot; with a small whole tone and a large<br/>semitone step close to 10:9 and 16:15, and the difference of<br/>about three commas close to the pental or 5-limit chromatic<br/>semitone at 25:24 (70.7 cents).</p><p>At times, of course, Holderian commas are used in decimal form as<br/>one unit for measuring actual performances, as with Baris Bozkurt<br/>and his colleagues. Also, because 31/53 octave is so close to a<br/>pure 3/2, a tuning based on 53-EDO or its subdivisions of 106-EDO<br/>and 159-EDO is sometimes advocated or indeed implemented by<br/>Middle Eastern musicians, with Ozan Yarman&apos;s 79-note or 80-note<br/>MOS subset of 159-EDO as a famous example. However, it is good to<br/>explain that often the 53-comma notation is used simply as a<br/>generic device to show the types and positions of steps and<br/>intervals, not as a precise measurement or prescription.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. The &quot;five commas&quot; within a 25:24 lagu, and temperament<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>One the most fascinating comments in your letter, whose wonder I<br/>hope will not be eclipsed by my pedestrian commentary, is the<br/>following:</p><p>&gt; in most of his tunings, these apotomes are boundered with<br/>&gt; syntonic commas and each remnant lagu (25/24) is divided in 5<br/>&gt; smaller commas of unequal but more or less even sizes.</p><p>Here I begin by picturing a framework for this the 25:24 space as<br/>follows, for example between the regular 256:243 limma and the<br/>regular 9:8 tone, a difference of an apotome or 2187:2048.</p><p>                           2187:2048<br/>   |-------------------------------------------------------|<br/>256/243    16/15                                10/9      9/8<br/>   |---------|...................................|---------|<br/>     81:80                   25:24                  81:80</p><p>Now this space between a large minor second or semitone at 16/15<br/>and a small tone at 10/9, indeed a territory measured by the<br/>25:24 ratio, is the realm known in Middle Eastern theory as the<br/>&quot;mujannab zone,&quot; the rather wide territory within which a<br/>mujannab interval (shown in the notation used by Safi al-Din and<br/>others by an Arabic letter &quot;J&quot; and in the modern Turkish alphabet<br/>as &quot;C&quot;) may fall. For Safi al-Din and modern Turkish theorists<br/>also, it may include small mujannab steps around 16/15 and large<br/>ones around 10/9, as well as middle or Zalzalian steps in the<br/>myriad shades represented, for example, by the intervening<br/>superparticular ratios of 14/13, 13/12, 12/11, and 11/10.</p><p>Let us for the moment assume that a transition from a large<br/>5-limit variety of minor second to a small neutral or supraminor<br/>second occurs somewhere between 15:14 (119.4 cents) and 14:13<br/>(128.3 cents); Hormoz Farhat suggests that neutral seconds may<br/>typically range upward in Persian music from about 125 cents.</p><p>The next transition might be from a supraminor or small neutral<br/>second to a &quot;smaller central&quot; neutral second, perhaps at around<br/>135 cents, with Ibn Sina&apos;s 13:12, his alternative of 64:59<br/>adopted by Safi al-Din, and al-Farabi&apos;s 88:81 all exemplifying<br/>this range.</p><p>Then comes the &quot;larger central&quot; region presumably starting, if we<br/>assume pure fifths, fourths, and 32:27 minor thirds, at somewhere<br/>roughly between 147 cents (half the size of such a third at 294.1<br/>cents) and al-Farabi&apos;s step of 12/11 (150.6 cents). This zone<br/>also includes the 59:54 step of Ibn Sina and Safi al-Din (153.3<br/>cents), and the 128:117 (155.6 cents) of Ibn Sina.</p><p>Perhaps somewhere around 160 cents. we enter a zone of &quot;submajor<br/>seconds&quot; with 11:10 (165.0 cents) well exemplifying this<br/>category, as it occurs in Safi al-Din&apos;s 9:8-11:10-320:297<br/>tetrachord which makes a fine Ottoman Rast.</p><p>Much beyond 11:10, we enter first an interesting region around<br/>170 cents or 1/7 octave where it may be difficult to discern the<br/>exact distinction between a very large neutral or very small<br/>major second, and then the precincts of 10/9 (182.4 cents), or<br/>the slightly smaller Pythagorean diminished third at 65536/59049<br/>(180.45 cents).</p><p>One simplification of this intricate situation might be to<br/>conceive of four regions of Zalzalian or neutral intervals, plus<br/>a lower region still partaking of pental or 5-limit minor (near<br/>16:15 or 15:14), and an upper region approaching or partaking of<br/>pental major.(near 10:9). While superparticular ratios often<br/>provide helpful landmarks, as well as some of the other<br/>traditional ratios going back in the literature the better part<br/>of a millennium or more, the Turkish and Syrian system of 53<br/>commas also offers some helpful guideposts. By around 6 Holderian<br/>commas or Hc for short (135.8 cents), neutral second steps are<br/>making a transition from &quot;supraminor&quot; to more of a &quot;central<br/>neutral&quot; quality; while at around 7 Hc (158.5 cents), we are<br/>moving from the &quot;large central&quot; zone to the realm of the<br/>&quot;submajor&quot; second.</p><p>Such a scheme with six conceptual zones between 16/15 and 10/9,<br/>and thus five intervals or &quot;commas&quot; often very fuzzily delimiting<br/>these zones, might go about as follows, with the transitions<br/>impressionistic and highly debatable, not to speak of the role of<br/>musical context:</p><p>          ~125c?    ~135c?              ~147c?                ~158c?<br/> 112c 119c  .  128c   . 139c  141c  143c  .  151c  153c   156c   .<br/>  |--------...-------..,-----------------...--------------------...<br/>16/15 15/14 . 14/13   . 13/12 64/59 88/81 .  12/11 59/54 128/117 .<br/> 5 Hc     5.5 Hc     6 Hc                6.5 Hc                 7 Hc<br/> 113c     125c       136c                147c                   158c</p><p>pental minor supraminor    small central        large central</p><p>                ~168c?<br/>    162c   165c   . 170c             182c<br/> ..--------------..........-----------|<br/>    56/51  11/10  . 32/29            10/9<br/>                  7.5 Hc            8 Hc<br/>                  170c              181c<br/>      submajor          pental major</p><p>The superparticular Zalzalian or neutral ratios are helpful in<br/>exemplifying each of the four middle zones. Thus 14/13 is a fine<br/>supraminor or small neutral second; 13/12 likewise a small<br/>central neutral second; 12/11 a large central neutral second; and<br/>11/10 a submajor second. Further it seems that the first three of<br/>these are toward the lower portions of their respective zones,<br/>while 11/10 may be not too far from the upper limits of its zone.</p><p>Comparing these ratios will yield commas in the traditional sense<br/>which give some idea of the spacing of these regions. From 16/15<br/>(clearly pental minor) to 14/13 (clearly supraminor or small<br/>neutral) is 105:104, or 16.6 cents. From 14/13 to 13/12 (clearly<br/>small central neutral) is 169:168, or 10.3 cents. From 13/12 to<br/>12/11 (large central neutral) is 144:143, or 12.1 cents. From<br/>12/11 to 11/10 (clearly submajor or large neutral) is 121:120, or<br/>14.4 cents. And from 11/10 to the clearly pental major 10/9 is<br/>100:99, or 17.4 cents.</p><p>Since the transitions between zones are fuzzy, to seek exact<br/>&quot;commas&quot; defining their metes and bounds would be<br/>unwise. However, if we adopt Farhat&apos;s view of neutral seconds as<br/>generally ranging from about 125 to 170 cents, then a region<br/>encompassing the realm from around 5.5 to 7.5 Hc would nicely<br/>convey this impressionistic estimate.</p><p>Curiously, each of the six zones may be crudely conceived as<br/>occupying the space of about 1/2-Hc, thus:</p><p>            Pental minor    (5   - 5.5 Hc, or 112-124 cents)<br/>            Supraminor      (5.5 - 6   Hc, or 124-135 cents)<br/>            Smaller central (6   - 6.5 Hc, or 135-147 cents)<br/>            Larger central  (6.5 - 7   Hc, or 147-158 cents)<br/>            Submajor        (7   - 7.5 Hc, or 158-170 cents)<br/>            Pental major    (7.5 - 8   Hc, or 170-182 cents)</p><p>Here it must be added that the pental minor region may begin with<br/>steps rather smaller than 16/15 or 5 Hc, with the 104-cent step<br/>in O3 sometimes serving this purpose although not as a main<br/>aspect of the tuning design, and the 106-cent step in Ozan<br/>Yarman&apos;s 79/80-MOS doing so as an essential feature of the<br/>design. As to the &quot;pental major&quot; region around 10/9, we must take<br/>caution that the lower part of this region around 1/7 octave may<br/>have more of an &quot;equable heptatonic&quot; or uncertain character,<br/>while the realm of small major seconds extends considerably<br/>beyond a just 10/9, or 8 Hc, to include for example the steps of<br/>a characteristic meantone at around 1/3-comma (189.6 cents) or<br/>the true mean-tone of 1/4-comma (193.2 cents) at midway between<br/>10/9 and 9/8.</p><p>Focusing on the four Zalzalian categories between pental minor<br/>and pental major, we may take the ratios of 14/13, 13/12, 12/11,<br/>and 11/10 as exemplary. Thus a JI system or temperament striving<br/>for variety might seek to approximate these ratios, or others,<br/>representing each of the four zones.</p><p>Now while the commas between these ratios are necessarily<br/>unequal, yet they may be reasonably although not perfectly<br/>represented by logarithmic aliquot steps.

In the just tuning, both the Mustaqim and<br/>Bayyati tetrachords use Ibn Sina&apos;s steps of 9:8, 13:12, and<br/>128:117. The latter two steps at 138.6 and 155.6 cents differ by<br/>almost 17 cents; but the O3 values of 138.3 and 150.0 cents<br/>subtract over 5 cents from the 128:117 step, and reduce the<br/>difference between the two steps to only 11.7 cents, missing the<br/>subtle variations from step sizes in the lower tetrachord.</p><p>Generally O3 tends to level out the variations in the just<br/>version between the pure fifths or fourths at four locations and<br/>the &quot;justly tempered&quot; fourth at 117:88 (493.120 cents) found at<br/>11/9-13/8, at a 352:351 or 4.925 cents wide. In 03, where this is<br/>one of the main commas tempered out, all fifths are impure by<br/>1.170 or 2.342 cents (1 or 2 TU).</p><p>In a polyphonic setting, the just Ibina with its 4:3 and 117:80<br/>fourths might somewhat resemble a well-temperament, while O3<br/>presents a near-regular &quot;gentle temperament.&quot; However, one of the<br/>more notable inaccuracies involves the beautiful Ibina sonority<br/>of 1/1-4/3-16/9 or 9:12:16 much favored by European composers<br/>around 1200 such as Perotin, and described by Jacobus of Liege in<br/>the early 14th century as a 16:9 &quot;split&quot; into two equal 4:3<br/>fourths. A classic resolution has the 4/3 and 16/9 steps each<br/>ascend by a tone above the stationary 1/1, arriving at<br/>1/1-3/2-2/1 or 2:3:4, the complete or perfect stable harmony of<br/>the era.</p><p>In O3, however, the 16/9 of Ibina is compressed by almost a full<br/>352:351 to 991.4 cents, or about 4.7 cents narrow. This minor<br/>seventh, or the slightly wider shading at 992.6 cents found for<br/>example at C*-Bb* (11/9-13/6), can nicely represent the just<br/>39/22 (991.165 cents) occurring at the latter location in Ibina.<br/>There is, however, no way of obtaining a just 4:3, or 16:9, or<br/>the pure form of the exquisite 9:12:16 sonority combining these<br/>ratios.</p><p>Also, from a melodic perspective, the subtle JI distinctions<br/>between steps of 9:8 and 44:39, as well as 12:11 and 128:117, are<br/>lost in the temperament process.</p><p>In O3 a regular minor third is at 288.3 cents (here E-G) or 289.5<br/>cents, both near 13:11 (289.210 cents), nicely representing a<br/>52:48:44:39 interpretation of the upper Bayyati tetrachord<br/>(E-F*-G-A) using much the same steps as those actually called for<br/>by the lower Mohajira tetrachord (13:12-44:39-12:11) in a<br/>different permutation. The Ibina sequence, however, calls for a<br/>Bayyati tetrachord at 108:117:128:144, with the slightly wider<br/>minor third at 32:27 (294.135 cents) which shapes many classic<br/>neutral third divisions including that of Ibn Sina (into 13:12<br/>and 128:117) featured in this sequence.</p><p>Of course, this is not to exclude O3 and other systems with<br/>extended fifths, but only to say that these systems are<br/>variations on the theme of JI which should leave room for that<br/>theme itself.</p><p>Again I am not sure how close I have come to your meaning in the<br/>discussion of Julien&apos;s five commas within a 25:24. Yet I regard<br/>the idea of four Zalzalian zones or regions, exemplified by the<br/>steps of 14/13, 13/12, 12/11, and 11/10, as a guide for<br/>temperaments as well as just tunings which strive for subtlety in<br/>maqam and dastgah music. And I would emphasize that such classic<br/>ratios as al-Farabi&apos;s 88/81, Ibn Sina&apos;s 128/117, or his 64/59 and<br/>59/54 variations adopted by Safi al-Din, are also basic landmarks<br/>often making a welcome appearance in your tunings.</p><p>With deepest thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=100855 href="#100855">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2011 3:47:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>Thanks for your enthusiastic response, fully documented as always with historical references and complements.</p><p>I know Julien Jalaleddine Weiss is very busy, preparing and giving concerts between Beyrouth, Damas et Alep for a huge ensemble these days, but he should be able to read your posts soon, for on many musicological points he should be the one to reply to you !<br/>I told him the interest you showed to his system and I am certain he will be delighted to exchange his knowledge of Arabic Maqam with you.</p><p>Just to complete my post, and for all our friends curious of Maqam, here is a close-up of Julien and the way he switches his Mandal-Orabs on one of his very microtonal qanuns :<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFIQMM8bZQk&NR=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFIQMM8bZQk&NR=1</a></p><p>And an interesting sufi-style interpretation of I suppose maqam Bayyati, with a Saba variation in the end, by Julien&apos;s ensemble in the Fes sacred music festival  2008 :<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-nI7QVuUDQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-nI7QVuUDQ</a></p><p>Something very microtonal I particularly enjoyed here is when the singer Sheikh Hamza Shakkur grabs the tonic at the upper octave at 2&apos;58&quot; shortly but impressively, before he passes the torch to the ney player - the way he pitches this note incredibly higher of God knows how many cents, while of course he could sing a 2/1 perfectly in tune if he wanted, makes me feel he is tuning to something beyond this world.<br/>I wonder if Julien can explain the interval he sings in this moment, I would say perhaps a 65/32, which would make sense as a &quot;Picardy third&quot; above 13/8, unless if in the context he forces a 8/7 over 16/9, or 128/63, which in both cases amounts to more or less the same thing.

Note that my tuning mentioned above, Bamm24b,<br/>&gt; does not have any just 5-limit ratios or Syntonon Diatonon tetrachords<br/>&gt; or modes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  It provides two sizes of each of the neutral intervals : seconds,<br/>&gt; &gt;  thirds, etc., except that within this limited number of notes<br/>&gt; &gt;  selected from the complete set of 77 notes, they can&apos;t be<br/>&gt; &gt;  experienced with the same tonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This raises an important point you discussed in your earlier long post<br/>&gt; on Maqam tunings. The vital thing is to have at least two sizes of<br/>&gt; neutral intervals, even if only one is available from a given step.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt; Even in O3, a 24-note system which does have some steps with two sizes<br/>&gt; of neutral intervals available at a comma apart, we can&apos;t get, for<br/>&gt; example, a moderate Rast (357.4 or 358.6 cents) and a moderate<br/>&gt; Mustaqim (345.7 or 346.9 cents) above the same note. That would<br/>&gt; require a lower and higher segah only 12 cents or so apart. What we<br/>&gt; can sometimes get, for example, is a high segah (369.1 cents) for a<br/>&gt; Turkish Rast or moderately low segah (345.7 cents) for a typical Arab<br/>&gt; Bayyati, a difference of a comma at 23.4 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, of course, a complete Tsaharuk does provide choices like a<br/>&gt; virtually just 72/59 or 59/48 above the same note, which I found in a<br/>&gt; 94-note version with five generators equal to a pure 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The neutral intervals of Rast will be the tonic of Bayyati or<br/>&gt; &gt; Mustaqim, and reversely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is also a pattern we see in Mohajira or Wilson&apos;s Rast-Bayyati<br/>&gt; matrix, with a Rast heptatone appearing in a version extended to 10 or<br/>&gt; more notes. And likewise an Arab Makam Sikah has the smaller neutral<br/>&gt; intervals in contrast to Rast; while Persian Dastgah-e Segah has the<br/>&gt; larger neutral intervals, in contrast to Mustaqim (or a modern gushe<br/>&gt; such as Shekaste like the old Mustaqim).</p><p>Would you make special distinctions between Sikah and Mustaqim, besides being related to different cultures ?</p><p>&gt; &gt; This has been concocted simply with a sequence of 11 schismatic<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths, transposed by 28/27.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, Bamm24b results from extending a variation on a 17-note<br/>&gt; tuning for the &grave;oud explained by Cris Forster in his book _Musical<br/>&gt; Mathematics_, but may be concocted as two chains of 11 pure fifths at<br/>&gt; a 531/512 apart (63.1 cents),</p><p>If this is the case then I confirm that both scales have quasi-identical structures, and differ by only minute variations. The identity of structure is not totally surprising since both express the best DE (distributionnally even) solution (if we make abstraction of the schismatic variations, more diverse in my own rational approximations)</p><p>&gt; or 14337:14336 more than 28/27!</p><p>You must know more than me about this extraordinary schisma (...I mean extrordinary for prime 59, and maqam lovers, as we both are !).<br/>It was present from the beginning in my rational approximations of Tsaharuk schismatic fifths sequences, from the &quot;4 generators&quot; = 112/81 (~ 177/128), then all the way to 7/4. But you were actually the first one to reveal it to me this winter in its impressive arithmetical expression, and whoever the &quot;inventor&quot; of it is, I wish to give credit, otherwise I will call it the Margo schisma !</p><p>&gt; Thus the only primes are 2, 3, and 59 -- while your Tsaharuk also has<br/>&gt; 5 and 7! The biggest difference may be that Tsaharuk 24 has pure<br/>&gt; 5-limit thirds, in line with Julien&apos;s standard, while in Bamm24b all<br/>&gt; usual fifths are pure.</p><p>I am not sure if pure 5-limit thirds would be the standard for the Julien, as for his qanuns he would rather have pure fifths everywhere.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  So 28/27 appears 12 times as the larger step, alternatively with<br/>&gt; &gt;  five 36/35 and seven septimal commas 64/63, all evenly<br/>&gt; &gt;  distributed. Their relative size in 171-edo is 9, 7, and 4 steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Bamm24b we have 12 larger steps at 531/512 (63.1 cents), five at<br/>&gt; 243/236 (50.6 cents), and seven at 131072/129033, smaller than 64/63<br/>&gt; by 14337:14336.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Nine quasi-pure 7/4 appear between the two fifth sequences, which<br/>&gt; &gt; can be surprising for a Maqam tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On this point Tsaharuk-24 and Bamm24b are similar, and I agree that a<br/>&gt; lot of modern Maqam theory doesn&apos;t emphasize septimal intervals. However, it<br/>&gt; said that in Maqam Ushshaq Masri (a variation on Nahawand<br/>&gt; associated with Egypt, somewhat like Persian Nava, with an upper<br/>&gt; Bayyati, e.g. re mi fa sol la si-d ut re, with &quot;si-d&quot; a half-flat, it<br/>&gt; is sad that the third is a comma lower than usual, which could mean<br/>&gt; around 7/6, with the seventh step maybe near 7/4. For a low Nahawand<br/>&gt; or Ushshaq Masri, Tsaharuk-24 might be very useful!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I&apos;ve heard that Maqam Buselik in Turkey may favor a low third<br/>&gt; around 7/6, and the 5-limit intervals of Tsaharuk-24 should fit a<br/>&gt; Turkish style also.</p><p>Thanks for these interesting informations !<br/>And have you any clue about what major third that would be used in Saba (5/4 or 81/64 ?)<br/>The first 3 notes of the Bayyatis found in both our tunings are followed by 81/64s.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But as I said in my first post, an optimal generator would arrive at<br/>&gt; &gt; 7:1 in 24 reiterations, while it gives also almost pure fifths,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is the first criteria Julien Jalaleddine Weiss and other<br/>&gt; &gt; musicians want for Maqam tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed it will give a pure 7/4 and an almost pure 3/2 (very slightly<br/>&gt; narrow) and 5/4 (likewise, with -40 generators at 385.290 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  In fact, a pure 7:1 attained in 24 generators creates a slightly<br/>&gt; &gt;  schismatic tuning of the fifths, that produces also quasi-pure 5/4<br/>&gt; &gt;  thirds, and this is the idea of this tuning, in this central zone<br/>&gt; &gt;  near 171-edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For this generator, Scala shows 140.368 cents, yielding a fifth around<br/>&gt; 701.839 cents. What I note is that 24 generators give a pure 7/4 and<br/>&gt; -40 a near-pure 5/4. With a fifth generator around 3/2, getting 7/4<br/>&gt; pure (-14 fifths) would require slightly extending the fifth, which<br/>&gt; would make 5/4 (-8 fifths) less pure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The average Tsaharuk generator in the tuning below, five of them<br/>&gt; &gt; giving a fifth, is 1.08444952 ~20/171 of octave, itself very close<br/>&gt; &gt; to the meta-temperament version of Tsaharuk, 1.084451679092 ; it<br/>&gt; &gt; often appears as 64/59 in this rational version of the temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An interesting point is that Bamm24b takes a pure 64/59 and 59/54 as<br/>&gt; one of its starting points (using generators of 3/2 and 531/512), but<br/>&gt; your Tsaharuk has generators of varying sizes around 3/2^1/5: for<br/>&gt; example 64/59 and 243/224, differing by 14337:14336, as well as two<br/>&gt; others a bit smaller helping to produce the pure 5-limit thirds.</p><p>Very well observed !</p><p>&gt; &gt; You will notice there are neither 11 nor 13 primes in this tuning,<br/>&gt; &gt; but only 2, 3, 5 , 7 and 59.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s curious that in Bamm24b, we have only 2, 3, and 59 -- but with<br/>&gt; the same types of approximations you mention next.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One of the reasons is that Tsaharuk tempers 352/351, and 59 finds<br/>&gt; &gt; its place precisely in between (59/48 for example is in the middle<br/>&gt; &gt; of 27/22 and 16/13).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, 59 is very close to exactly between 11 and 13. A 59/48, for<br/>&gt; example, is larger than 27/22 by 649:648, and smaller than 16/13 by<br/>&gt; 768:767, respectively 2.670 and 2.256 cents. Early this year I did a<br/>&gt; lattice for Bamm24b showing some of these near-equivalences:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/hexapentadic17.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/hexapentadic17.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Very nice matrix - you shoud definitely show this to Julien some day !</p><p>&gt; &gt; I am only giving a rational version here, the more useful for<br/>&gt; &gt; fretting applications ; but it expresses a temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pure thirds, fitting Julien&apos;s criteria, do make the tempering<br/>&gt; clear.</p><p>I am not certain of what is Julien Jalaleddine Weiss&apos;s criteria about major thirds actually, between pythagorean or 5-limit, or between a consonant ideal and actual frettings - or if he just admits certain schismatic variations, in the indian shrutis sense.</p><p>&gt; With Bamm24b, we have basically two chains of 11 pure fifths at a<br/>&gt; 531/512 apart, almost identical to a 28/27, which could be tuned by<br/>&gt; ear,</p><p>I never thought of it but it&apos;s true - perhaps with the help of intermediaries like 16/9 and 32/27 ?<br/>While for 27/26 it would perhaps be more difficult -</p><p> so the only &quot;tempering&quot; is the 14337:14336 difference (0.121<br/>&gt; cents). In 1024-ED2, the generators are 599 steps (703.953 cents) and<br/>&gt; 54 steps (63.281 cents) -- a virtually pure 3/2 I suspect Julien would<br/>&gt; accept, and an approximation of 531/512 about 0.200 cents wide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, while we have lots of 72/59 and 59/54 thirds for rast-segah<br/>&gt; in Bayyati or Mustaqim and Rast (but, as with Tsaharuk-24, not both positions<br/>&gt; above a single step), and nine virtually pure 7/4&apos;s, Julien<br/>&gt; would notice that there are no pure ratios of 5. They are not a part<br/>&gt; of the design, although some schismatic thirds will occur -- in<br/>&gt; contrast to the pure 5/4 and 6/5 thirds of tsaharuk-24, or near-pure<br/>&gt; thirds with complete Tsaharuk tunings using 7^1/24, for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also notice that a Tsaharuk-94 with the 7^1/24 generator has some<br/>&gt; other near-just intervals like 13/11 and 17/14</p><p>Interesting - JJW actually uses more than 77 notes in his qanuns and could very well use those.</p><p>&gt; -- and lots of places<br/>&gt; supporting both Rast with segah near 59/54 and Mustaqim or Bayyati<br/>&gt; with segah near 72/59!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo</p><p>Thanks for this detailed analyse and comparison.
