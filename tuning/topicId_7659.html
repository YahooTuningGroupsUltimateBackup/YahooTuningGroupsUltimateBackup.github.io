The triad I am talking about<br/>&quot;locks&quot; in tune. There is no doubt about that. It would seem to me that<br/>&quot;poor&quot; singers may not be listening carefully for adjustments that create<br/>this locked-in tuning. I have to think we are talking about two different<br/>things.</p><p>As Dan Stearns suggested, it seems that we are more or less at an impasse<br/>here until we introduce some actual sounds into the exchange. I am working<br/>on that from my end, but that may take a bit of time. When the<br/>sound-analysis software comes that I ordered, I will attempt to create (or<br/>record and analyze) a 14:18:21 triad and see whether this is the same as<br/>&quot;my&quot; triad. In the meantime, how difficult would it be for you to create one<br/>and upload it?</p><p>Incidentally, Sheila Chandra, one of the best singers I have heard (CD:<br/>&quot;Moonsung: A Real World Retrospective,&quot;) is &quot;inconsistent&quot; in that she seems<br/>to use both the 4:5 third and the &quot;high&quot; third, even within in the same<br/>phrase, over a double drone (tonic and dominant). She sings the opening<br/>thirds below &quot;piano pitch&quot; and the later thirds above it. In both cases the<br/>thirds lock beautifully. If you haven&apos;t heard her, I highly recommend<br/>finding her album. (Real World label)</p><p>Aside, I know very well that the 6:7:9 minor triad locks vividly. Creating a<br/>sound illustration for my book CD, I was moving the third of a C triad<br/>downward gradually from a &quot;locked&quot; major third position to a &quot;locked&quot; minor<br/>third position while holding the root and fifth constant. When I moved it<br/>&quot;too far&quot; down to what was apparently a 6:7 ratio, I got a very audible low<br/>F in my recording. It took considerable time to find a &quot;compromise&quot; position<br/>that would both illustrate the point and avoid the low F. (Why should life<br/>be this hard? But then what would we do with the extra spare time anyway?)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Paul H.
