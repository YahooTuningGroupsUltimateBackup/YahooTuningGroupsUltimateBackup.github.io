It only<br/>&gt; spans 8 generators, so even in Miracle-10 there are two of them, and<br/>&gt; 13 of them in Blackjack.</p><p>Here I would say that use of &quot;suspended&quot; is fine either in a setting<br/>where that subfourth would often resolve down to a major third (a<br/>variant on the 4-3 suspension of Renaissance-Romantic practice); or in<br/>a kind of &quot;popular&quot; notation where &quot;sus4&quot; has come to mean &quot;a fourth<br/>without a third,&quot; whether or not it actually resolves as a suspension.</p><p>The main implication of the &quot;suspended&quot; terminology for me is that of<br/>a style where thirds and sixths are stable intervals, and the fourth<br/>is appearing &quot;in place of&quot; a third, with at least some implication<br/>that it _might_ resolve to this third. Here&apos;s an example of such a<br/>resolution to a 4:5:6:7 tetrad:</p><p>   Fv4<br/>   D4<br/>   Cv4   B4<br/>   G3</p><p>Here the voice at the 21:16 subfourth (~470.78 cents) resolves to a<br/>5:4 (~386.31 cents), moving downward by a semitone of 21:20 (~84.47<br/>cents), a step equal to a 16:15 less the 64:63 comma.</p><p>Since a Miracle-type tuning is very likely to be used mainly for<br/>styles of a &quot;7-limit or higher&quot; variety, with 5:4 as an element in<br/>many stable sonorities, the &quot;suspended&quot; terminology would seem to me<br/>as fitting as it is in popular guitar chord nomenclatures, for<br/>example.</p><p>In styles such as neo-Gothic where thirds and sixths are unstable, or<br/>fifths and fourths are regarded as the primary concords, we&apos;d want to<br/>use a different kind of terminology. As you point out in your<br/>discussion of interval names,</p><p><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/IntervalNaming.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/IntervalNaming.htm</a>.</p><p>it&apos;s more generally at best difficult to come up with a single set of<br/>conventions to fit all tunings or styles.</p><p>However, with the kind of setting a Miracle-style tuning is likely to<br/>imply, &quot;sm7sus-s4&quot; has the advantage of familiarity for people used to<br/>&quot;sus4,&quot; etc.</p><p>Kennan Pepper, by the way, himself refers to 1:1-21:16-3:2-7:4 or<br/>0-471-702-969 cents as a &quot;3-7 square chord,&quot; maybe suggesting this<br/>kind of geometry:</p><p>                                4:3<br/>                        Cv4 ----------- Fv4<br/>                          |              |<br/>                    21:16 |              | 7:6<br/>                          |              |<br/>                         G3 ----------- D4<br/>                                3:2</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=24831 href="#24831">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 6:44:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kennan Pepper, by the way, himself refers to 1:1-21:16-3:2-7:4 or<br/>&gt; 0-471-702-969 cents as a &quot;3-7 square chord,&quot; maybe suggesting this<br/>&gt; kind of geometry:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                 4:3<br/>&gt;                         Cv4 ----------- Fv4<br/>&gt;                           |              |<br/>&gt;                     21:16 |              | 7:6<br/>&gt;                           |              |<br/>&gt;                          G3 ----------- D4<br/>&gt;                                 3:2<br/>&gt;<br/>I would guess that Keenan P. was instead suggesting a geometry in which you&apos;d switch the<br/>positions of Cv4 and Fv4, so that you&apos;d have 7:4 intervals on both sides of the square -- which<br/>shows how the chord would appear on a square lattice with a 3-axis horizontally and a 7-axis<br/>vertically.</p></div>
