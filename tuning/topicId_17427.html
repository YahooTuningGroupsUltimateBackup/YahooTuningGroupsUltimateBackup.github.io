I seem to recall an article in<br/>Xenharmoniphobicon a while back that claimed P.D.Q. Bach&apos;s<br/>original tuning of the organ at Wein-am-Rhein Cathedral<br/>was 13 tET, and that he added the extra note to get a<br/>&quot;really big sound&quot; out of an &quot;otherwise pitifully flatulent<br/>instrument&quot;...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=17493 href="#17493">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2001 7:35:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Monz wrote:]<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t know about any specific or technical microtonal<br/>&gt;indications in P.D.Q. Bach scores, but I know for sure where<br/>&gt;you can hear some microtonal P.D.Q.:</p><p>&gt;Give a listen to his oratorio _Iphegenia in Brooklyn_, which<br/>&gt;includes double-reeds in its instrumentation.  But that&apos;s<br/>&gt;literally *double-reeds*, *NOT* double-reed instruments!<br/>&gt;The players blow on the reeds alone, in harmony, and wow!,<br/>&gt;what harmonies they are!!!</p><p>Right you are!  He does similar things in &quot;Oedipus Tex&quot;, and in the<br/>&quot;Four Folk Song Upsettings&quot; found in the &quot;WTWP Classical Talkity-Talk<br/>Radio&quot; album.  In the case of Oedipus Tex, a french horn is gradually<br/>assembled throughout the piece, so it gradually goes from absurd to<br/>a lovely, real instrument.  The WTWP album is a hoot from beginning to<br/>end, including two early rock songs recorded by Elvis&apos;s younger brother,<br/>Enus (who sounds suspiciously like Schickele with an effects processor).</p><p>So, maybe PDQ is already microtonal...</p><p>JdL</p></div>
