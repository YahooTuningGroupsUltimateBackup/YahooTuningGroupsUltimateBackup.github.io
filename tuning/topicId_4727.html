Myhren</p><p>I ckecked out this website and Aha! Groven actually used 1/8-schisma<br/>temperament, extended to 36 notes! Funny how the threads in this list tend<br/>to cross! The 36 notes were used for an automatic dynamic tuning mechanism:</p><p>&quot;Within an unlimited pitch universe, this type of procedure would, of<br/>course, lead to a continuous drifting of pitch. To ensure that a modulating<br/>piece of music can return to the exact same starting tonic, the performer<br/>selects ahead of time one of fourteen pitch-fields, each containing only 22<br/>of the 36 pitches.&quot;</p><p>22 consecutive pitches in 1/8-schisma temperament has a fascinating<br/>connection with the famous 5-limit 22-tone Indian system, in that the two<br/>differ only in subschismatic (&lt;2 cent) details.</p><p>More:</p><p>The seljefl&#xFFFD;yte is an indigenous folk instrument made from the branch of a<br/>willow. As there are no finger-holes, pitches are produced by over-blowing<br/>and stopping the end opening with your finger. The resulting scale, follows<br/>the intervals of the harmonic series and can be closely approximated on<br/>Groven&apos;s organ . . .<br/>In this realization, the 11th, 13th, and 7th partials deviate by a few cents<br/>up or down, while the other intervals are all within a half-cent from the<br/>indicated pure ratio. This is but one example of the numerous fixed-scales<br/>which Groven employed in his arrangements of Norwegian folk music.</p></div>
