What follows does not<br/>nescessarily apply to you.</p><p>You, the musician or composer are probably using a tuning system known as Twelve<br/>Tone Equal      Temperament, abbreviated as 12-tet.</p><p>&quot; I can understand the twelve tones, but what does equal refer to ? Also what is<br/>temperament ? They never mentioned this in music class.&quot;</p><p>Your teachers probably didn&apos;t know what tuning system they were using either !</p><p>Ok imagine an infintite continuum of pitch from very low to very high. You could<br/>select pitches for your musical instruments from anywhere along this pitch<br/>continuum [P.C from now on]. You also could select any amount of tones from this<br/>P.C. Now which tones would you select ?</p><p>&quot; I don&apos;t know... I suppose I would pick out the ones that sounded the best.&quot;</p><p>Yes so would I. So lets do that. I&apos;m going to take two sound sources playing<br/>harmonic timbres, I&apos;ll explain what a harmonic timbre is in a moment but for the<br/>time being some examples of harmonic timbres are trumpets [brass], the bowed and<br/>plucked string family, woodwinds and the human voice. All these timbres are<br/>quite musical. Do you agree ?</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>Good ! Now I&apos;ll take, say, two trombones playing a unison [same tone or note]<br/>and then tell Trombone 1to hold that note.  I&apos;ll then instruct Trombone 2, to<br/>slowly gliss up through the P.C. When You hear a note that you like say &quot;Hold it<br/>!&quot;</p><p>Ok,  let&apos;s begin. Trombone 2 do your thing !</p><p>[Trombone 1 slides up the P.C, maintaining a constant volume. It reaches a<br/>subminor third [7/6]]</p><p>&quot;Hold it !&quot; [Trombone holds the note at the indicated pitch]</p><p>Ok so. Why did you choose this interval ?</p><p>&quot;It sounded rough and made a sort or warbling tremelo sound. Like an opera<br/>singer ! And then the warbling slowed down until it became all smooth and there<br/>was no longer any tremelo.&quot;</p><p>What you heard are called beats. Now I&apos;ll explain harmonic timbres to you.<br/>Trombone 2 is playing a tone now. I can sing that pitch. [He does so. And sings<br/>a unison with the trombone.] But that is not the only tone it is playing. There<br/>are other fainter tones as well at higher pitches that blend in with the<br/>fundamental pitch  [tonic]. Like when a string quartet plays a chord starting<br/>and ending together. It all sounds like  one instrument. Well the other tones in<br/>the trombone are like that but they are very simple instruments and they all<br/>sound the same. If they played on their own they would sound very boring. These<br/>instruments are called sine tones or sine waves.  The pitches of these sine<br/>waves follow a certain numerical relationship : 1:1, 1:2, 1: 3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:7<br/>... and so on. The numbers are called the harmonic series.</p><p>&quot;What do the numbers mean ?&quot;</p><p>They denote a relationship, a ratio if you will between two pitches. In my<br/>previous example the number 1:1 is the same as the two trombones playing in<br/>unison, in the next one ie 1:2. It is like Trombone 2 playing an actave above<br/>Trombone 1</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p></div>
