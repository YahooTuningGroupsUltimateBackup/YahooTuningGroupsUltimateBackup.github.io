Why not let the archives speak<br/>for themselves?</p><p>Kraig, as I recall, you were the one relayed the information from Erv<br/>Wilson that what was being called &quot;Miracle&quot; was not new.  Yes, here<br/>it is:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25489">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25489</a></p><p>And here is Paul&apos;s and Dave&apos;s immediate reaction:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25539">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25539</a><br/>and Paul&apos;s request to Monz a day later to set the record straight:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25591">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25591</a></p><p>Now here&apos;s a trivia question: Does anyone remember who first used the<br/>term &quot;secor&quot; for the Miracle generator?  (Hint: Ironically, it&apos;s<br/>someone who recently complained about a lot of arbitrary names being<br/>made up on tuning-math to identify families of temperaments and who<br/>objected especially to names of people being used for that purpose.)<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27028">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27028</a></p><p>And does anyone remember Paul&apos;s reaction?<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27029">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27029</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; Secor saw the concept long before and if you guys would have done<br/>&gt; &gt;your homework you wouldn&apos;t have dug a whole for yourself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?</p><p>It was buried way back there in XH3 and, to the best of my knowledge,<br/>never mentioned again by anyone (except for that brief correction I<br/>made in XH5 for the size of the minimax generator).  I was really<br/>quite surprised that Erv remembered it after all these years.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway it shows the complete lack of generosity and the outright<br/>&gt; &gt;intellectual imperialism going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, I&apos;d love to hear from George Secor on whether *he* perceived<br/>&gt; any lack of generosity in this connection.
