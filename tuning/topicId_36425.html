I make alternative musical instruments (sorry I can&apos;t refer to a site, since I&apos;m heavily renovating my current site for four years of news) and the fretting is quite professional; there are absolutely no buzzy strings or skipped frets (something hard to do in a tuning as tight as 31tet).  It&apos;s a very nice classical guitar, $600 new, will post more of its info as interest comes in.  Hardshell case included.<br/>I will send pics of it all to whoever shows interest.  I could post this to ebay and ask for 100bucks just to get it off my hands, but I really do not want to sell any instruments to anyone who will not end up playing them... so please show interest, so we could have an efficient flow of the right tools to the right people.<br/>I&apos;m thinking a modest price- 300 negotiable.</p><p>-Pete</p></div><h3><a id=36426 href="#36426">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2002 8:02:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Peter &lt;PETER.BLASSER@O...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi!<br/>&gt;   I have a 31tet classical guitar that I&apos;d love to sell.

A very high quality (600$ new) with hardshell case.  I did the refretting (I make musical instruments and have long experience fretting) and there are absolutely no buzzes or skipped frets, which is hard to do in 31tet.  I will send extensive pix and info to whoever shows interest.</p><p> I could post this on ebay and try to get 100 bucks just to get it off my hands, but I strongly believe that good instruments like this should go into good players hands...  so please show interest so I don&apos;t have to turn to ebay or such.</p><p> I&apos;m thinking a negotiable $300.</p><p>-Pete</p></div>
