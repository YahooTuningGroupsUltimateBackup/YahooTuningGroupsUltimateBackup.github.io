This is<br/>pretty much a necessity considering that a first listen is likely to<br/>flood most listeners in a thicket of cerebral hypertension that sits<br/>somewhere between the post-Webern composers and the quick-cut school.<br/>Though to be fair, even this prevailing texture gives way to<br/>instantly recognizable contrasts--44, 65 and especially the zany old-<br/>timey squall that unexpectedly blooms out of 56 would be obvious<br/>examples.</p><p>I&apos;ve also gone back to give your dissertation another look, and after<br/>hearing the piece I&apos;m finding this quite rewarding.</p><p>I tend to think seeking out and even creating apprehensible<br/>hierarchies is a reflexive part of the mind&apos;s congenital disposition.<br/>The face on Mars... hell, I had whole races of morphing beings<br/>embedded into the paneling on my wall when I was growing up! Now<br/>depending on the endeavor, this &grave;gift&apos; could rightfully be considered<br/>a curse or a blessing--take your pick or maybe you&apos;re born with it.<br/>But to my way of working and dealing with it, oblique and densely<br/>static information like that in the Pollock example you cite, is<br/>routinely parsed into attainable gestures; melodies and rhythms, a<br/>veritable musical DNA if you will.</p><p>This kind of abstraction seems to me to be the easy part. It also<br/>seems to be exactly the point where composers were impelled to reduce<br/>the freewheeling allegoric whirl of abstract impressionism into a<br/>more manageable formalism--hence serialism and all its near cousins.</p><p>This is a tradeoff that obviously paid large dividends when it came<br/>to macro organization, because composers have to work in a much<br/>different time frame from painters. Generally speaking, even the most<br/>difficult of paintings is immediately apprehensible in its totality,<br/>whereas you have to allow a piece of music to run its course before<br/>you can even begin to ponder its totality. I believe this is where<br/>some of the analogies between painting and composing begin to break<br/>down a bit as regards &quot;flatness&quot;.</p><p>Simply put, I think it&apos;s much more difficult to sustain and<br/>effectively present a sense of abstractionism, or &quot;flatness&quot;, in long-<br/>form presentations like novels or substantial musical compositions.<br/>It seems to me that the things that make an abstract expressionist<br/>painting (like those of Jackson Pollock) special are almost fatally<br/>enervated when their immediacy is spread across these types of long-<br/>form mediums.</p><p>Clearly you understand this through and through, and you offer useful<br/>strategies for curbing this sort of a dissipation and fatigue.<br/>However, I think it&apos;s worth noting that I&apos;ve always gotten a strong<br/>sense of &quot;obvious or dimensionally conjunct large-scale goals, points<br/>of arrival, &grave;climaxes,&apos; sectional boundaries and the like&quot; in many of<br/>the other pieces of yours that I&apos;ve heard. In many of these pieces<br/>unpredictability and artistic stewardship were in a perfectly<br/>rewarding synchronization--in fact I&apos;d consider this to be a CB<br/>trademark.</p><p>So far Sand seems to be asking me more enticing questions than it&apos;s<br/>answering. And while I believe this is rooted at least in part to the<br/>fact that Sand is comprised of less scintillating and<br/>multidimensional textures than some of your earlier works, I also<br/>feel as though I&apos;m still only pecking away at the surface of many of<br/>these questions.</p><p>As far as the use of alternative tuning in Sand... I think it&apos;s only<br/>relevant in that the tuning isn&apos;t the same old same old, and while<br/>it&apos;s obvious enough that more is not necessarily more interesting,<br/>more interesting is more interesting (especially in the hands of a<br/>talented composer such as yourself). Unfortunately this sort of<br/>thinking is antithetical to so much of what&apos;s posted on these lists,<br/>and is therefore (understandably) given little press and often held<br/>in deep suspicion... did anyone respond to your original posting?</p><p>To my mind music is more allegory than psychoacoustic construct. And<br/>if it&apos;s allegory&apos;s right and proper business to present the clear and<br/>the obscure in a context that allows each something on the order of a<br/>symbiotic equal-footing, lucid symbolism is only going to upset the<br/>apple cart anyway.</p><p>These are hardly the perennial tuning-list minutia of lattice metrics<br/>and calls to maximize consonances and overthrow the evil serialist&apos;s<br/>evil 12-tet conspiracy. But then again, it&apos;s precisely in this regard<br/>that Sand and its accompanying dissertation are one of the more<br/>thought provoking and substantial contributions I&apos;ve seen to these<br/>forums in the years that I&apos;ve been here... thanks.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/dissert.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/dissert.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;This is a new piece I wrote over a period of about a year.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;On the page you&apos;ll find the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;mp3&apos;s of &quot;improvisations&quot; or &quot;explorations&quot; of small sections<br/>of<br/>&gt; the piece done with a computer-music &quot;interface&quot; I constructed so<br/>that the<br/>&gt; piece itself becomes more like a painting, or a work of<br/>architecture---you<br/>&gt; can listen to the whole thing, or &quot;zoom in&quot; on parts of the whole.<br/>&gt; Another way of putting it is that I was interested in &quot;erasing&quot; the<br/>&gt; boundary between so-called &quot;minimalism&quot; and &quot;maximalism&quot;---this<br/>piece is,<br/>&gt; or can be, both.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;You can also go to the bottom of the page and hear the piece<br/>as a<br/>&gt; whole---or in 5 parts of 5-9&apos; each.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Finally, if you want to learn more about the &quot;aesthetic<br/>issues&quot;<br/>&gt; raised by the work, you can read the &quot;essay&quot; linked from the main<br/>page.<br/>&gt; These include a section on &quot;flatmusic&quot; and the interface;  a<br/>section on<br/>&gt; the piece&apos;s construction, and the *why* of that construction--<br/>apropos for<br/>&gt; this list considering recent discussions----and finally some<br/>aspects of<br/>&gt; the sounds, and computer-music techniques.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;(yes, these writings were part of a dissertation---I suppose<br/>that<br/>&gt; probably makes me a fraud and a charlatan--as a musician--for which<br/>I<br/>&gt; apologize.
