I perused<br/>Johnston&apos;s article &quot;Scalar Order as a Compositional Device&quot; and made<br/>a futile attempt to read Helmholtz...<br/>The idea of combining Partch&apos;s O- and Utonalities with Fokker&apos;s<br/>melodic groupings- melodic sets created by mixing harmonics and<br/>subharmonics of different pitches- fascinates me, but I wonder if<br/>there is some possible system to it that I don&apos;t know about.</p><p>I&apos;ve also familiarized myself with the theories of Koffka and<br/>Wertheimer re Gestalt, e.g., the laws of Pragnanz, good continuation,<br/>common fate; and with George A. Miller&apos;s concept of &apos;The Magical<br/>Number 7 +/- 2.&apos;  It seems to me both of these ways of explaining<br/>perception have a huge bearing on what is thought to be beautiful in<br/>music.  I also suspect most microtonalists don&apos;t consider these.</p><p>I think that, when presented with too many pitches, the brain will<br/>attempt to simplify the set by defining some in terms of others.  So<br/>that, given:</p><p>1/1  9/8  6/5  5/4  7/5  3/2  8/5  7/4  9/5</p><p>There&apos;s no way to treat each pitch as a separate item, so they&apos;ll<br/>tend to be grouped according to tonality, even if melodic movement<br/>doesn&apos;t follow the same logic, at least to a certain point.</p><p>What sorts of broader schemes are there for harmonic relations in<br/>JI?  I&apos;m thinking of common-tone modulations in particular; I&apos;ve<br/>heard some that intrigue me, and I can hear some logic, but I don&apos;t<br/>know enough about it to know where to start in my own experiments.<br/>I have a cheap Yamaha keyboard hooked to WinXP with Scala, which<br/>seems to be all I need, but trying to map all the pitches I might<br/>want to include is daunting.  Perhaps there is a useful system for<br/>switching between different scales in the memory banks that could<br/>provide the kind of variety I want.</p><p>Does Meyer&apos;s &apos;Emotion and Meaning in Music&apos; approach any of this<br/>stuff?</p><p>Gestalt illustrations:<br/><a href="http://www.ethnomusic.ucla.edu/courses/276/gestalt.htm">http://www.ethnomusic.ucla.edu/courses/276/gestalt.htm</a></p><p>Miller:<br/><a href="http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html">http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html</a></p><p>Later.<br/>-Chuckk</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2004 2:58:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Chuckk,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;touchedchuckk&quot; &lt;BadMuthaHubbard@h...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also familiarized myself with the theories of<br/>&gt; Koffka and Wertheimer re Gestalt, e.g., the laws of<br/>&gt; Pragnanz, good continuation, common fate; and with<br/>&gt; George A.

This we see in Ben Johnston&apos;s work.</p><p>Paul Erlich has done quite a bit of work thinking about and relating<br/>consonances.  One of the practical derivatives has been<br/>the &quot;Blackjack&quot; scale, which is a scale of 21 notes very close to JI<br/>(within 3 cents, for the most part).  However, many of the basic<br/>pitches relate to each other by JI intervals, and it is possible to<br/>plot &quot;common tone&quot; harmony with the use of a &quot;Blackjack lattice&quot;<br/>which shows, visually, the near-JI connections.</p><p>So, this kind of thing has been going on with this list...</p><p>J.
