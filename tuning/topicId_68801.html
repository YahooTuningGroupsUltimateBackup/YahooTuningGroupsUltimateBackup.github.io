For example Werckmeister III has 4 minor thirds worse<br/>than ET and 3 better - not a great difference.</p><p>When it comes to key colour, both types have disadvantages. &apos;M&apos;<br/>tunings tend to give the same, relatively comfortable, colour to a lot<br/>of central keys, but a few outlying keys become strikingly<br/>uncomfortable. (Although they may still be bearable, depending on the<br/>degree of inequality.)</p><p>&apos;P&apos; tunings give strikingly pure thirds in a few central keys, but the<br/>intonation in most other keys is relatively uncomfortable and<br/>unvarying (e.g. the chronically Pythagorean intonation of Werckmeister<br/>III in many keys).</p><p>To obtain optimal key colour variation, meaning that within given<br/>limits on the size of thirds, there should be as little as possible of<br/>the circle of fifths where the purity of thirds is not audibly<br/>varying, it seems to me that one ought to get close to the &apos;NO&apos;<br/>temperaments where the thirds deviate symmetrically either side of ET.</p><p>Almost all Neidhardt tunings, and Kellner&apos;s, and Lehman&apos;s, are mildly<br/>&apos;P&apos;, whereas Werckmeister&apos;s 1698 continuo instructions give an &apos;M&apos;<br/>tuning.</p><p>Young and Vallotti, being absolutely symmetrical, are &apos;NO&apos; - but Young<br/>1 and Vallotti have the flaw with respect to key colour that there are<br/>strings of 3 major, and 4 minor thirds with no change in intonation.<br/>So &apos;NO&apos; is not a sufficient condition.</p><p>Barnes is an improvement in being &apos;NO&apos; and only having strings of 2<br/>major and 3 minor thirds of the same size. Young II is still better.</p><p>Of course, key colour variation is only one thing to be considered,<br/>besides the absolute purity of the &apos;best&apos; and &apos;worst&apos; thirds and<br/>fifths, the balance between sharps and flats, etc...</p><p>For example if you don&apos;t want any Pythagorean major thirds, then you<br/>might try replacing Young&apos;s PC/12 fractions with SC/12 and sticking<br/>the extra schisma at F#-C# for</p><p>C -2 -2 -2 A -2 -1 -1 F# -1 0 0 Eb 0 -1 -1 C</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=68807 href="#68807">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2007 6:01:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What do you think of using flat octaves and thus doing<br/>better than ET on average, according to some ways of<br/>calculating consonance?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=68820 href="#68820">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2007 12:31:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Meantone as usually defined results in 8 major and 9 minor thirds<br/>&gt; being better and 4 and 3 resp. being worse.<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning results in 8 major and 9 minor thirds being worse<br/>&gt; and 4 and 3 resp. being better (in fact virtually pure).</p><p>I don&apos;t much like this analysis, because it is a pure 5-limit analysis.<br/>A meantone tuning in an unweighted optimal 5-limit range around 81-et<br/>will also have nearly pure 7/6s for the &quot;bad&quot; minor thirds which use<br/>augmented seconds.
