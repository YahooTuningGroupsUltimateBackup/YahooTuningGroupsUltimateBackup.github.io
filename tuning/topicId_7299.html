I just do my best to<br/>sing in tune.</p><p>&gt;and that webpage is concerning Johnson&apos;s microtonal vocals,<br/>&gt;I&apos;d like to point out to both of you one of the most surprising<br/>&gt;things I found after doing my analysis:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;At the end of the very first line of the song (on the word<br/>&gt;&apos;man&apos; in &apos;I&apos;m a drunken hearted man...&apos;), Johnson sings<br/>&gt;a note which is the &apos;3rd&apos; of the tonic D-major chord.<br/>&gt;It begins quite a bit below the 12-tET (12-EDO?) &apos;3rd&apos;,<br/>&gt;then rises quite far above it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What surprised me was that the ending pitch is *clearly*<br/>&gt;far higher than the Pythagorean &apos;3rd&apos; [= 81/64 = ~408 cents].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I hear it as starting out approximately 14 cents below<br/>&gt;2^(4/12) [= 400 cents] and rising to ~27 cents above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The starting pitch is quite clearly implying a 5/4<br/>&gt;[= ~386 cents], and I interpreted the ending pitch rationally<br/>&gt;as a 32/25 [= ~427 cents].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I considered 9/7 [= ~435 cents] as the ending pitch, but<br/>&gt;when I tuned the MIDI track up to that, it sounded too high<br/>&gt;and did not (to my ears) accurately reflect Johnson&apos;s vocal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I settled on 32/25 because my criteria, aside from closeness<br/>&gt;in pitch, was lowness of prime/integer limit, and those were<br/>&gt;the smallest ratio-numbers which fit.</p><p>Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I will tune my guitar so that I<br/>can hear 32/25. Note the following:</p><p>        (9/7) / (32/25) = 225/224 = 1.00446</p><p>        1200*(log(225/224)/log(2)) = 7.71</p><p>So the two intervals vary by less than one half of one percent, just under<br/>8 cents.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/27/1999 10:43:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Joe Monzo &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;At the end of the very first line of the song (on the word<br/>&gt;&apos;man&apos; in &apos;I&apos;m a drunken hearted man...&apos;), Johnson sings<br/>&gt;a note which is the &apos;3rd&apos; of the tonic D-major chord.<br/>&gt;It begins quite a bit below the 12-tET (12-EDO?) &apos;3rd&apos;,<br/>&gt;then rises quite far above it.</p><p>My recollection is that Mick Jagger did a similar thing with &quot;You can&apos;t..&quot;.<br/>Does anybody have the recording handy to check?</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/30/1999 4:53:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In early November of 1999 I wrote:</p><p>&gt;How about a new topic?

That&apos;s<br/>why I haven&apos;t put in my two cents about my impressions. Based on what<br/>everybody else has reported, if the 9/7 is actually as high as Joe has it<br/>then it is probably the case that my guitar experiment wasn&apos;t quite right,<br/>maybe due to old strings with inharmonic overtones.

Since John Link&apos;s guitar version also<br/>&gt;&gt; sounded very &quot;good&quot; to me, I think the 7:9 theory moves to<br/>&gt;&gt; the top of the list of possibilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whoa, hold on there!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This file<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/young9.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/young9.mid</a><br/>&gt; actually contains the complete chord<br/>&gt; mentioned by Daniel Wolf [TD 493.17], 32:48:56:63:72.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the 4:6:7:9 drone, with the 63/32 &apos;pseudo-octave&apos;<br/>&gt; which is an 8:9 above 7/4, added in as the sung pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the vibrato your MIDI setup is producing, you probably<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t notice the &apos;off&apos; 32:63 &apos;octave&apos;, hearing it instead<br/>&gt; as 1:2, and apparently you&apos;re hearing the &apos;6&apos; as a &apos;12&apos;<br/>&gt; (i.e., an &apos;octave&apos; too high).  Those two mishearings would<br/>&gt; give the 7:8:9:12 you mention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the presence of 63/32 in the chord would certainly help<br/>&gt; your sung 21/16 &apos;lock&apos;, as can be readily seen from the<br/>&gt; lattice:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           63/32 ---------- 9/8<br/>&gt;            /               /<br/>&gt;           /               /<br/>&gt;        21/16 ---------- 3/2<br/>&gt;         /               /<br/>&gt;        /               /<br/>&gt;      7/4 ----------- 1/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 4:6:7:9 describes the pitches 1/1 - 3/2 - 7/4 - 9/8.</p><p>All I know is that when I sang the 2:3 fifth above the seventh partial, I<br/>was experiencing a perfectly tuned major triad with high third and added 6th<br/>and 9th (for example, Bb-C-D-F-G) The &quot;original&quot; root (C) was inaudible to<br/>me in a low octave so it was easy to hear the Bb as the root.</p><p>I&apos;m sure your numbers are significant, Monz, but I&apos;m focussing here on the<br/>7:9 third.

The 7:9 third is most<br/>definitely present as the top interval in the drone: 4:6:7:9.</p><p>If you sang the F 21/16 correctly, which as I show above<br/>you probably did, because it&apos;s easy to hear, then you most<br/>certainly did hear the 14:18:21 &apos;major triad with high 3rd&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Bottom line: If that was the 7:9 third, it sounds very close<br/>&gt; to what I have been calling the &quot;high third.&quot;</p><p>OK.  But if you&apos;re hearing 7:9 as the &apos;high 3rd&apos; here, you<br/>should also be hearing it as the &apos;high 3rd&apos; in my MIDI-file<br/>of your experiment, because it&apos;s exactly the same interval!</p><p>I suggest that the context is playing tricks on you here.</p><p>&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The URL given above is the only filename I ever intended to<br/>&gt;&gt; use for this experiment, and it should contain 7 different<br/>&gt;&gt; versions of the &apos;high 3rd&apos;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; Now that I remember it happening before with multiple<br/>&gt; downloads, I think that my computer adds the next number<br/>&gt; automatically when more than one of the same file is<br/>&gt; introduced to the finder.</p><p>Yes, that typically happens, at least in Windows.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll trash the early ones and perhaps that will allow the<br/>&gt; latest version to open.</p><p>My suggestion - trash all of them and download it anew,<br/>just once.

I often<br/>perform this demonstration (or a close approximation) on my meantone piano<br/>and my 22-tET guitar. Hopefully, Joe Monzo or someone else will help create<br/>a MIDI file that will once and for all dispell all doubts that these<br/>intervals are really one and the same. I strongly encourage the rest of you<br/>to go over to your synth and try it yourself. Report back to us on what you<br/>hear. Everyone&apos;s been strangely silent on this issue!</p><p>First, use 7:9 in a major triad, 7:9:10.5 (aka 14:18:21). Hold this for a<br/>while. Then drop out the upper voice, and introduce three lower voices,<br/>forming a 4:5:6:7:9 with the 7:9 held constant. Voila! The interval that was<br/>once so dissonant is now quite consonant. What&apos;s going on here? Just another<br/>demonstration that context is everything. If the ear can understand the 7:9<br/>as the seventh and ninth partials of a clear fundamental, it is hearing<br/>something it is very familiar with. Almost every instrumental timbre has<br/>seventh and ninth partials -- though they normally go by unnoticed, they can<br/>be clearly heard if one focuses one&apos;s attention on them. However, in the<br/>triad 14:18:21, the numbers are too high to unambiguously represent familiar<br/>partials of a fundamental at 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 (which would correspond to<br/>the _second_ of this chord). The ear (actually the brain&apos;s central pitch<br/>processor) is confused -- it thinks it might be hearing a 4:5:6, or maybe<br/>7:9:11, or maybe 5:6:7; 14:18:21 might even enter in as a weak contender if<br/>it&apos;s in a high enough register. This confusion corresponds to a high degree<br/>of what I call &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;, which is an important component of what<br/>we call dissonance.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@io.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2000 9:21:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 31 Jan 2000 17:22:13 -0500, &quot;Paul H.
