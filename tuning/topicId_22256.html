Also has<br/>a very pleasant interface with some novel ideas in it.</p><p>However, I think the original programmers are the ones to do the<br/>actual coding for it.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in integrating my programs to work with it.</p><p>I.e. my program could call up justmusic, in the same way that it<br/>can call up SCALA, and pass a scale to it, or other information,<br/>and justmusic could call up FTS in the same way that Scala can<br/>call FTS.</p><p>For my VRML trees program, maybe fts, justmusic and scala could call it<br/>up to get a VRML tree or lattice, but that is a very vague idea<br/>at present as I haven&apos;t yet done the first release of this program.</p><p>For FTS, I have idea of working on chord recognition using Manuel&apos;s<br/>new chords lists in SCALA. That relates to lattices, and so could<br/>relate to justmusic, looking a fair way ahead now.</p><p>I&apos;ve belonged to the JM mailing list for some time, and tried it out,<br/>and made a number of suggestions and ideas for it, and as you see,<br/>am interested to integrate my programs with it.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot involved in taking a program the last step of removing<br/>all the bugs and getting it to work really smoothly, and the original<br/>programmers are the best ones to do that. It is well worth doing, and<br/>there is a lot of satisfaction in finally producing a program that<br/>really works, all the time, whatever you give it in the way of input.</p><p>Meanwhile, back to finishing FTS 1.09! I&apos;ve just started coding on<br/>it again after quite a break. After that, VRML trees release I hope,<br/>maybe without music to start with, but I think it will later have some<br/>music possibilities, at least for showing musical trees, and maybe<br/>musical lattices, in VRML :-)</p><p>Then back to FTS, as I have so many things I want to add to it<br/>(see the for the future section of the beta download page for a<br/>few of them). Includes Monz&apos;s solar system orrery at some point!</p><p>It&apos;s nice of Monz to ask me to take over &quot;his&quot; project. However,<br/>I have no wish to do that. Everything I have said about JM is<br/>in the way of suggestions only, and sorry if there has been<br/>any misunderstanding about this.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
