How do we know<br/>acculturation altered our hearing? So I ask...</p><p>If a tonal chord progression is played in the woods, but nobody with<br/>the proper set of internalized rules is around to hear it, is it still<br/>in a key?</p><p>Does the concept of &quot;a piece of music&quot; not only mean the information<br/>present in the sound, but also implicitly include an algorithm present<br/>in the observer that extracts said information from the music?</p><p>A thought experiment for you all:</p><p>Let&apos;s say that we played Dvorak&apos;s New World Symphony for someone<br/>living in an unknown subterranean culture in, uh, Timbuktu... 400<br/>years ago. Now let&apos;s say that, by some utter miracle of coincidence,<br/>it just so happens that Dvorak&apos;s New World Symphony is completely<br/>intelligible to them - but in an entirely different way than it is to<br/>us. Let&apos;s say that they also have an analogous concept of &quot;key,&quot; but<br/>it just so happens to be activated by different things than ours -<br/>instead of V7-I being the signal for the tonic, it&apos;s III-i or<br/>something. Or maybe they&apos;re used to 16-equal, and so to them this<br/>piece activates their internalized mavila tonal structure, which is<br/>completely different from ours.</p><p>But either way, let&apos;s say that they find the performance riveting, but<br/>it was in a completely different key than we&apos;d hear it as, and the<br/>function of every single chord was completely different, and also it<br/>activated certain musical features that we have no concept or idea of<br/>- just like as it&apos;s likely that many cultures have no concept or idea<br/>of a &quot;key.&quot; And also they hear minor chords as needing desperately to<br/>resolve, but coincidentally they always do in a way that satisfies<br/>them.</p><p>Was the piece of music they heard the same piece of music that we heard?</p><p>There will always be someone who responds to this question with a curt<br/>&quot;Of course, they were listening to the same piece of music, but they<br/>just heard it differently.&quot; But those who are used to philosophical<br/>wankery like what I&apos;ve laid out above will realize that this is<br/>obviously not the point. The point is that you cannot separate the<br/>music from its observer, which is a realization that has had profound<br/>consequences in a number of scientific fields, and it might just be<br/>about time for it to work its way into music theory. Music is a<br/>collection of bits of information, and we have algorithms to extract<br/>that information back out of it. This includes things like learned<br/>factors of what constitutes a &quot;tonic,&quot; learned Rothenberg-style<br/>melodic patterns, perhaps more complex behaviors like an awareness of<br/>how this piece relates to other similar pieces, etc. Without such<br/>factors in place we wouldn&apos;t be able to derive any information out of<br/>the music at all, or if we did it certainly wouldn&apos;t be the same<br/>information that we do now. Therefore -</p><p>Therefore when we say that we can come up with a chord progression in<br/>xxxx temperament, and that it might sound &quot;functionally intelligible&quot;<br/>400 years from now - you are absolutely right, and that is also a<br/>zero-entropy statement. Can anyone come up with an example of what<br/>might NOT sound &quot;functionally intelligible&quot; 400 years from now? What<br/>tuning could possibly exist that it is impossible to extract structure<br/>from? What encrypted information could possibly exist that contains no<br/>possible decryption algorithm? If you want to go all the way with it -<br/>EVERY feature that we&apos;re looking to &quot;generalize&quot; in music right now is<br/>a bit arbitrary. It&apos;s all rooted in psychoacoustics, sure, but the<br/>concept of a &quot;key,&quot; of a &quot;chord,&quot; of &quot;functional harmony,&quot; etc - not<br/>only might a culture 400 years from now like different instantiations<br/>of these concepts than what they&apos;re used to, but they might not like<br/>them at all - they might have latched onto novel musical phenomena<br/>that we can&apos;t even imagine, which would also be rooted in<br/>psychoacoustics.</p><p>I&apos;ll put it to rest now and see what your thoughts are about this topic.</p><p>-Mike Battaglia</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2011 2:00:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Typo -</p><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s all rooted in psychoacoustics, sure, but the<br/>&gt; concept of a &quot;key,&quot; of a &quot;chord,&quot; of &quot;functional harmony,&quot; etc - not<br/>&gt; only might a culture 400 years from now like different instantiations<br/>&gt; of these concepts than what they&apos;re used to</p><p>That should say &quot;than what WE&apos;RE used to.&quot; The point is that not only<br/>might they like different types of harmony, or &quot;functional harmony,&quot;<br/>or whatever, than we do, there might be an entirely new musical<br/>percept that we can&apos;t even imagine that could supplant that.

There really isn&apos;t a way to work this in to music theory, because the learned factors that influence musical (and other artistic) perception are so idiosyncratic and so complex that not even the observer is aware of all of them, much less someone observing the observer.  And yet at the same time, I&apos;m pretty sure our perceptions are also rather elastic--there&apos;s no &quot;one way&quot; even a single person will always hear the same composition.  Hell, just the &quot;mood&quot; I&apos;m in when I listen to a piece changes how I perceive it, let alone other factors like noticing new details or zoning out because I have other stuff on my mind.  When we perceive a piece of music, we&apos;re never &quot;just&quot; perceiving it, so another pertinent question is, how do we draw the line between our &quot;perception&quot; of the music and other concurrent cognitive processes not immediately related to processing the incoming musical stimuli?</p><p>&gt; Music is a<br/>&gt; collection of bits of information, and we have algorithms to extract<br/>&gt; that information back out of it. This includes things like learned<br/>&gt; factors of what constitutes a &quot;tonic,&quot; learned Rothenberg-style<br/>&gt; melodic patterns, perhaps more complex behaviors like an awareness of<br/>&gt; how this piece relates to other similar pieces, etc. Without such<br/>&gt; factors in place we wouldn&apos;t be able to derive any information out of<br/>&gt; the music at all, or if we did it certainly wouldn&apos;t be the same<br/>&gt; information that we do now.</p><p>Oh, that&apos;s not even HALF the picture.  We never just &quot;extract&quot; information from a stimulus, we also create information in response to the stimulus.  Listening is as much a creative process as it is a consumptive or associative process.  But even the associative aspect alone--the way a piece of music triggers memories and touches off other tangential thought processes (like inspiration or other emotional responses)--tells us that we&apos;re doing a lot more than just &quot;extracting&quot; information.  If we ignore those other factors and focus only on the extraction, we&apos;re never going to get a complete picture that makes sense.</p><p>&gt;What tuning could possibly exist that it is impossible to extract structure<br/>&gt; from? What encrypted information could possibly exist that contains no<br/>&gt; possible decryption algorithm?</p><p>This has less to do with tuning and more to do with composition.  It&apos;s arguable that the work of some of the atonalists does precisely this (defies decryption).  But of course it still triggers associations, and thanks to perceptual feedback, people can still find it meaningful.  So I think the answer to your question is that there is *nothing* that, by some virtue of its structure or tuning alone, is utterly immune to the human ability to manufacture meaning.  Even random gargling beeps and blorps produced by a computer with no structure and not even a definite tuning will have some meaning to someone.</p><p>&gt; If you want to go all the way with it -<br/>&gt; EVERY feature that we&apos;re looking to &quot;generalize&quot; in music right now is<br/>&gt; a bit arbitrary.

But where I think you are leaping to too much of a conclusion is assuming that because we latched on to some particular psychoacoustic phenomenon and correlated it with some semantic content, that that means there&apos;s something inherently semantic about that psychoacoustic phenomenon.  There&apos;s really no reason to suspect the semantic content of music is due to a process any different than the semantic content of language.  When you think about it, the phonology of an &quot;o&quot; sound makes it fundamentally different than the phonology of an &quot;e&quot; sound or a &quot;k&quot; sound or an &quot;s&quot; sound, and it&apos;s those differences that make it possible for cultures to assign semantic content to different collections of sounds.  But there really is no correlation between the phonology of words and their semantic content, so why should we suspect music will work differently?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2011 10:47:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, May 17, 2011 at 7:19 AM, Steve Parker &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Listeners from only a few hundred years ago would find Dvorak unbearably dissonant, but I think any listener is likely to hear tonic etc in the same way,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; because its stability or otherwise is deeply rooted in the harmonic series, which is even more deeply rooted in the primes - surely as fundamental an object as is possible.<br/>&gt; Steve P.</p><p>Steve, the example I gave was that of a subterranean culture located<br/>underneath Timbuktu a few hundred years ago.

What are we<br/>getting at here? It sounds like our goal with the study of microtonal<br/>music is to blow people&apos;s minds by giving them something that &quot;works&quot;<br/>that they&apos;ve never heard before, which is a goal that is rooted in<br/>subjectivity.</p><p>If that&apos;s the case, then it makes no sense for us to arbitrarily<br/>decide that they then need to learn to hear the music the way we want<br/>them to. Well, we certainly can do that, but the reasoning behind it<br/>is tautological in nature. I&apos;ll leave it at this for now and see if<br/>you understand what I&apos;m getting at.</p><p>&gt; Why do we need to go to such extreme conditions?

I&apos;m not convinced that it&apos;s impossible to uncover<br/>what they are. They are, at most, a general &quot;frame&quot; or set of<br/>principles that influences how we cognize sound.</p><p>&gt; And yet at the same time, I&apos;m pretty sure our perceptions are also rather elastic--there&apos;s no &quot;one way&quot; even a single person will always hear the same composition.

If we ignore those other factors and focus only on the extraction, we&apos;re never going to get a complete picture that makes sense.</p><p>The generative component of listening is where I&apos;d draw the line at<br/>the question you asked above. We can generate different holistic<br/>responses to pieces of music, but what we&apos;re really doing is<br/>generating different holistic responses to the information that we&apos;re<br/>deriving from the music, because we have no idea what &quot;the actual<br/>piece of music&quot; is. There is no piece of music. A Critique Of Pure<br/>Music, that&apos;s what this is.</p><p>Once we&apos;ve managed to decipher the information encoded in the music,<br/>the synesthetic or generative response to the information you&apos;ve<br/>deciphered is another level of variation. Perhaps what is needed is a<br/>greater study into how humans pull patterns out of sound IN GENERAL -<br/>i.e. apply basic principles of pattern recognition to music - then see<br/>which methods predominate in human beings today and exploit them in<br/>underutilized ways for musical purposes.</p><p>This is what we&apos;re trying to do indirectly with our foray into higher<br/>primes in the harmonic series, right? Trying to find things that<br/>humans can hear without realizing it. But then we corrupt the whole<br/>thing by saying that humans have to learn to hear things the way we<br/>want, which is the opposite of the last sentence.</p><p>&gt; &gt;What tuning could possibly exist that it is impossible to extract structure<br/>&gt; &gt; from?

It&apos;s arguable that the work of some of the atonalists does precisely this (defies decryption).</p><p>The hell it doesn&apos;t! I can decrypt the most atonal work you can throw<br/>at me, given enough exposure. The Rite of Spring, for instance,<br/>although being more &quot;polytonal&quot; than &quot;atonal,&quot; was completely<br/>incomprehensible to me, and now I can decrypt the entire bits of it.<br/>Eb7/Emaj now sounds like part of E lydian #2, for example. (But am I<br/>decrypting it &quot;correctly?&quot; lol)</p><p>A GOOD WORKING HYPOTHESIS might be that human beings, given repeated<br/>exposure to a stimulus, tend towards the interpretation of that<br/>stimulus that yields the LEAST amount information while still<br/>cognizing as much of the signal as possible. That is to say, from an<br/>information theory standpoint, we tend towards an encoding of the<br/>signal that approaches its entropy. I&apos;m still not sure how to<br/>practically apply this to music theory. I hope I or one of us is smart<br/>enough to turn this into a concrete model.</p><p>&gt; But of course it still triggers associations, and thanks to perceptual feedback, people can still find it meaningful. So I think the answer to your question is that there is *nothing* that, by some virtue of its structure or tuning alone, is utterly immune to the human ability to manufacture meaning. Even random gargling beeps and blorps produced by a computer with no structure and not even a definite tuning will have some meaning to someone.</p><p>That&apos;s the idea. Being as this is the case, I point out again the<br/>previously mentioned contradiction between the two ideals of finding<br/>patterns of sound that humans can already unexpectedly cognize, and<br/>manufacturing patterns of sound along with an instruction manual for<br/>how to cognize them.</p><p>&gt; Psychoacoustics is neat because it explains lots of auditory &quot;illusions&quot; like VFs, combination tones, and maybe periodicity buzz (though that one seems less than settled).</p><p>LOL, that one is settled, dude. It&apos;s settled insofar as some kind of<br/>&quot;critical band&quot; type effect is involved. Attempts to push this off<br/>onto the brain instead of the peripheral auditory system don&apos;t get<br/>around the core mathematical issue that it&apos;s likely the interactions<br/>within some kind of filterbank that are involved. I have yet to see a<br/>concrete alternative theory proposed.</p><p>&gt; But where I think you are leaping to too much of a conclusion is assuming that because we latched on to some particular psychoacoustic phenomenon and correlated it with some semantic content, that that means there&apos;s something inherently semantic about that psychoacoustic phenomenon.</p><p>???

The auditory system doesn&apos;t have the<br/>benefit of there being some computer to perform a full forward Fourier<br/>transform on the signal, so we&apos;ve had to evolve various bioengineered<br/>solutions to the problem. Instead, we have a set of evolved features<br/>to help us perform this process of extracting frequencies from the<br/>signal, and then another set of evolved features to help us perform<br/>the process of matching them to an internalized template of the<br/>harmonic series, all of which are stochastic processes. Without these<br/>processes, speaking in terms of primes would be meaningless, because<br/>we&apos;d have no way to tell what frequencies are in the signal, and hence<br/>we wouldn&apos;t be able to assign those frequencies numbers for there to<br/>be prime ones of.</p><p>Furthermore, perfect frequency resolution would require us performing<br/>the Fourier transform from now until the end of time on the signal,<br/>meaning we&apos;d have no time resolution. So the fact that we have time<br/>resolution blurs our resolution in the frequency domain, introducing<br/>some uncertainty in the signal. Thus we never really know if a prime<br/>is a prime, or a mistuned version of some other prime, etc. This is<br/>compounded by the fact that learned factors can bias us anyway to<br/>change the perspective that we take on stimuli.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2011 2:25:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; OK, so then what is music? What is music theory? What exactly are we<br/>&gt; studying? Sounds to me like we&apos;re just studying the contemporary<br/>&gt; patterns in which human beings are currently conditioned to analyze<br/>&gt; sound, and that the entire concept of music is not a truly &quot;timeless&quot;<br/>&gt; phenomenon.</p><p>Well, studying music theory is also a form of conditioning ourselves to hear things the way we&apos;re &quot;supposed to.&quot;  I can&apos;t tell you how many bands I&apos;ve been in where we argued over chord progressions or harmonizations (&quot;that sounds wrong!&quot; &quot;No, your version sounds wrong!&quot;), and where I butted heads with classically-trained people because I thought the &quot;proper&quot; progression/harmonization/voicing sounded unnatural.</p><p>&gt; Since that is the case, what is &quot;microtonal music&quot; then? What are we<br/>&gt; getting at here? It sounds like our goal with the study of microtonal<br/>&gt; music is to blow people&apos;s minds by giving them something that &quot;works&quot;<br/>&gt; that they&apos;ve never heard before, which is a goal that is rooted in<br/>&gt; subjectivity.</p><p>That sounds more or less correct.</p><p>&gt; If that&apos;s the case, then it makes no sense for us to arbitrarily<br/>&gt; decide that they then need to learn to hear the music the way we want<br/>&gt; them to. Well, we certainly can do that, but the reasoning behind it<br/>&gt; is tautological in nature. I&apos;ll leave it at this for now and see if<br/>&gt; you understand what I&apos;m getting at.</p><p>I agree.  Of course one of the problems we face is that the more time a person spends with an alternative tuning, the more natural it sounds to them, so progressions that would sound insane to the average listener come to feel totally normal.  That&apos;s how I feel, anyway.</p><p>&gt; It is indeed problematic, which is why we need to go to such extreme<br/>&gt; conditions. The example above is clearly defined the circumstances<br/>&gt; such that the other subject does NOT hear the Dvorak they hear the<br/>&gt; same way. Were they listening to the same piece of music?</p><p>Again, are any two people ever listening to the same piece of music?  Can you ever listen to the same piece of music twice?</p><p>&gt; For your claim that this insight can&apos;t be applied to music theory to<br/>&gt; be true, it would have to be the case that these learned factors<br/>&gt; --cannot-- be made aware of, not just that people aren&apos;t generally<br/>&gt; aware of them now. I&apos;m not convinced that it&apos;s impossible to uncover<br/>&gt; what they are. They are, at most, a general &quot;frame&quot; or set of<br/>&gt; principles that influences how we cognize sound.</p><p>Dude, these &quot;learned factors&quot; could be something as random as watching your parents dance to a Frank Sinatra song when you were 4, or a particular song being on the radio in the car when your dad got pulled over with you in the passenger seat when you were 2.  I have the vaguest glimmer of a memory of when I was maybe 3 or 4 and I had just learned the word &quot;comfortable&quot; which I thought sounded like &quot;convertible&quot; and whenever I would hear either word I would mentally picture a convertible with big pillowy seats.  I mean there are all kinds of crazy random associations that get wired in when you&apos;re a small child that ultimately shape the way you process the world as an adult, and they&apos;re all important.  Do you really think we can figure out enough of them for any one person to understand how that person&apos;s musical cognition really works?</p><p>For another point of view: take a 13-year-old girl from Chicago who&apos;s grown up on rap and pop music.  What do you think she&apos;d make of Dvorak?  She&apos;d probably be so bored by it that any considerations about &quot;key&quot; and &quot;functionality&quot; wouldn&apos;t even enter the equation.</p><p>&gt; We draw the line between them at the point where the listening process<br/>&gt; generates new information, not just derives information from the<br/>&gt; signal. See below.</p><p>Easier said than done.</p><p>&gt; The generative component of listening is where I&apos;d draw the line at<br/>&gt; the question you asked above. We can generate different holistic<br/>&gt; responses to pieces of music, but what we&apos;re really doing is<br/>&gt; generating different holistic responses to the information that we&apos;re<br/>&gt; deriving from the music, because we have no idea what &quot;the actual<br/>&gt; piece of music&quot; is. There is no piece of music. A Critique Of Pure<br/>&gt; Music, that&apos;s what this is.</p><p>Rather, there is a piece of music, but we cannot experience it directly.  Read up on the distinction between &quot;phenomenon&quot; and &quot;noumenon&quot; before you go any further with the Kant analogies.</p><p>In any case, the information we &quot;decode&quot; from the music is inseparable from the information we generate in response to it, at least so far as cognition is concerned.  The encoding of the auditory stimuli into neural impulses is pre-conscious.</p><p>&gt; Once we&apos;ve managed to decipher the information encoded in the music,<br/>&gt; the synesthetic or generative response to the information you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; deciphered is another level of variation. Perhaps what is needed is a<br/>&gt; greater study into how humans pull patterns out of sound IN GENERAL -<br/>&gt; i.e. apply basic principles of pattern recognition to music - then see<br/>&gt; which methods predominate in human beings today and exploit them in<br/>&gt; underutilized ways for musical purposes.</p><p>But this kind of top-down approach is really doing things the &quot;hard way&quot;.  No one in the history of man has ever needed to understand this stuff in order to make music before, and we don&apos;t &quot;need&quot; it now.  Why?  Because we are all humans, too, meaning we are already &quot;using the software&quot; that you&apos;re trying to find/write the manual for.</p><p>As Carl so astutely pointed out to me, even humans that ostensibly share the same culture--say, for instance, the denizens of San Francisco--cannot agree on what music &quot;sounds good&quot;, even when it&apos;s all in the same tuning.  Trying to use a maximally-general approach (as you seem to be looking for) is likely to be either unsuccessful or trivially successful.  You&apos;d probably have an easier time trying to figure out why some people like heavy metal and others prefer smooth jazz.</p><p>&gt; This is what we&apos;re trying to do indirectly with our foray into higher<br/>&gt; primes in the harmonic series, right? Trying to find things that<br/>&gt; humans can hear without realizing it. But then we corrupt the whole<br/>&gt; thing by saying that humans have to learn to hear things the way we<br/>&gt; want, which is the opposite of the last sentence.</p><p>Really the important thing is to get people to like what they&apos;re hearing enough that they want to understand it, and I think that has less to do with tuning and more to do with...dare I say, production values.  Elaine Walker&apos;s &quot;Love Song&quot; makes BP sound much more intriguing to me than any of those retched solo clarinet pieces.  If you put pretty much *any* tuning in a context that is familiar and appealing to a listener, you&apos;ll get a positive response.  But I&apos;ve said this before often enough.</p><p>&gt; The hell it doesn&apos;t! I can decrypt the most atonal work you can throw<br/>&gt; at me, given enough exposure. The Rite of Spring, for instance,<br/>&gt; although being more &quot;polytonal&quot; than &quot;atonal,&quot; was completely<br/>&gt; incomprehensible to me, and now I can decrypt the entire bits of it.<br/>&gt; Eb7/Emaj now sounds like part of E lydian #2, for example. (But am I<br/>&gt; decrypting it &quot;correctly?&quot; lol)</p><p>How about this one:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNt6a5xFOnE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNt6a5xFOnE</a></p><p>&gt; A GOOD WORKING HYPOTHESIS might be that human beings, given repeated<br/>&gt; exposure to a stimulus, tend towards the interpretation of that<br/>&gt; stimulus that yields the LEAST amount information while still<br/>&gt; cognizing as much of the signal as possible. That is to say, from an<br/>&gt; information theory standpoint, we tend towards an encoding of the<br/>&gt; signal that approaches its entropy. I&apos;m still not sure how to<br/>&gt; practically apply this to music theory. I hope I or one of us is smart<br/>&gt; enough to turn this into a concrete model.</p><p>I think you&apos;ll get to your stated goal of producing microtonal music people like much faster if you just write a bunch of microtonal music that you like.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s the idea. Being as this is the case, I point out again the<br/>&gt; previously mentioned contradiction between the two ideals of finding<br/>&gt; patterns of sound that humans can already unexpectedly cognize, and<br/>&gt; manufacturing patterns of sound along with an instruction manual for<br/>&gt; how to cognize them.</p><p>So let me put it a different way: if you give people a packet of musical stimuli full of familiar auditory cues where only the tuning is different, they will be quite likely to &quot;unexpectedly cognize&quot; the new stuff.  It&apos;s all in the framing.  The frame IS the manual, in a sense.</p><p>&gt; LOL, that one is settled, dude. It&apos;s settled insofar as some kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;critical band&quot; type effect is involved. Attempts to push this off<br/>&gt; onto the brain instead of the peripheral auditory system don&apos;t get<br/>&gt; around the core mathematical issue that it&apos;s likely the interactions<br/>&gt; within some kind of filterbank that are involved.

And to that effect, the avenue we&apos;ve chosen to effect that<br/>result is the notion that a large part of this intelligibility has<br/>something to do with the harmonic series, and that a way to extend on<br/>it might be to go up to higher-limit harmonies. We also discovered MOS<br/>scales, looked into some set theory in the form of Rothenberg<br/>propriety, and this is where we&apos;re at. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s perfect. The<br/>tritone hypothesis and the rare interval hypothesis and Rothenberg&apos;s<br/>stuff are decent guesses at least partway in the direction I&apos;m looking<br/>for, but no, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s perfect yet. But you think the only<br/>way to improve on this would be to go to every single individual<br/>person in the world, delve into the nuances of their childhood, and<br/>factor every single piece of that information into the end result?</p><p>Perhaps what would satisfy you is a theory for what causes people to<br/>override their existing frame for the sake of a new one. E.g. people<br/>aren&apos;t going to be bitching about a tuning violating their sense of<br/>diatonic hearing if it&apos;s being played on a 20,000 watt system with a<br/>bitching deadmau5 psychedelic light show behind it on a giant stage<br/>and subwoofers at every corner of the room. They&apos;re going to be like<br/>AHHHHHHH THIS IS AWESOME</p><p>Stick them in a sterile room with fluorescent lights and listening<br/>examples played on GM timbres and they might not react the same way.</p><p>&gt; Rather, there is a piece of music, but we cannot experience it directly. Read up on the distinction between &quot;phenomenon&quot; and &quot;noumenon&quot; before you go any further with the Kant analogies.</p><p>Is there such a thing as a &quot;noumenal composition&quot; when you factor in<br/>that the composition was something created by a composer?</p><p>&gt; In any case, the information we &quot;decode&quot; from the music is inseparable from the information we generate in response to it, at least so far as cognition is concerned. The encoding of the auditory stimuli into neural impulses is pre-conscious.</p><p>Why should it be inseparable? I just separated it: there&apos;s the level<br/>by which we frame the music into different tonal centers and chords<br/>with functions, then there&apos;s the &quot;meaning&quot; that we derive from the<br/>sequence in which they&apos;re arranged, then there are additional layers<br/>of meaning that we derive from how this arrangement might differ from<br/>or resemble the status quo, and then there&apos;s the Great Unknown of the<br/>unconscious where you cross-relate whatever meaning you&apos;ve just<br/>derived to every other experience you&apos;ve ever had in your life. We<br/>don&apos;t need to look at the full intricacies of this process in order to<br/>understand the first two parts of it, nor does the truth that these<br/>parts are coupled together necessitate that we can&apos;t divide the<br/>process into stages and look at each one separately.</p><p>&gt; But this kind of top-down approach is really doing things the &quot;hard way&quot;.

Your suggestion above, that<br/>this ideal can be reached by simply providing familiar auditory cues<br/>in a different tuning, is the opposite extreme. I&apos;d say that it isn&apos;t<br/>unexpected cognition at all, because cognitive awareness of the tuning<br/>isn&apos;t something that people generally have much access to when<br/>listening to a piece of music. Rather, it&apos;s the cognitive cues that<br/>they&apos;re being presented with that they do have access to, so if you<br/>happen to use a certain tuning in such a way to just present those<br/>same cues, then you aren&apos;t hitting upon unexpected patterns of<br/>cognition at all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; LOL, that one is settled, dude.

Throw in some sexy dancers and some variety of inebriation, and you&apos;ve got a revolution on your hands.</p><p>&gt; Is there such a thing as a &quot;noumenal composition&quot; when you factor in<br/>&gt; that the composition was something created by a composer?</p><p>Sure--the composition becomes a noumenon as soon as it leaves the composer&apos;s head.</p><p>&gt; Why should it be inseparable? I just separated it: there&apos;s the level<br/>&gt; by which we frame the music into different tonal centers and chords<br/>&gt; with functions, then there&apos;s the &quot;meaning&quot; that we derive from the<br/>&gt; sequence in which they&apos;re arranged, then there are additional layers<br/>&gt; of meaning that we derive from how this arrangement might differ from<br/>&gt; or resemble the status quo, and then there&apos;s the Great Unknown of the<br/>&gt; unconscious where you cross-relate whatever meaning you&apos;ve just<br/>&gt; derived to every other experience you&apos;ve ever had in your life. We<br/>&gt; don&apos;t need to look at the full intricacies of this process in order to<br/>&gt; understand the first two parts of it, nor does the truth that these<br/>&gt; parts are coupled together necessitate that we can&apos;t divide the<br/>&gt; process into stages and look at each one separately.</p><p>Sure, you can separate them, but it&apos;s an artificial post-hoc separation.  Nobody&apos;s mind is perfectly &quot;one track&quot;.</p><p>&gt; ?? What does this have to do with what I wrote? I&apos;m not talking about<br/>&gt; a practical approach to music making, which I already have, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; talking about gaining a better insight into how music works. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; always been one to learn the rules, throw them away, then figure out<br/>&gt; what you&apos;re doing, then write new rules.</p><p>Well, go right ahead.  It&apos;s a rabbit hole I&apos;m not too interested in going down.  The amount of research and effort it would take to find the meaningful answers to the questions you&apos;re asking is way out of my price-range.</p><p>&gt; Elaine Walker&apos;s &quot;Love Song&quot; doesn&apos;t sound like anything radically<br/>&gt; different to me.</p><p>And yet, it&apos;s in Bohlen-Pierce, a non-octave tuning that looks a lot like a slightly-squashed 8-EDO.

I&apos;d say that it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; unexpected cognition at all, because cognitive awareness of the tuning<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t something that people generally have much access to when<br/>&gt; listening to a piece of music. Rather, it&apos;s the cognitive cues that<br/>&gt; they&apos;re being presented with that they do have access to, so if you<br/>&gt; happen to use a certain tuning in such a way to just present those<br/>&gt; same cues, then you aren&apos;t hitting upon unexpected patterns of<br/>&gt; cognition at all.</p><p>Sounds like your saying that if people hear the tuning and think it sounds weird, we&apos;re doing it wrong, but if they don&apos;t hear the tuning (regardless of how weird it is), we&apos;re also doing it wrong.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll consider it settled when you and Carl agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is not the best way to evaluate the veracity of research.</p><p>When two people I know, smart people who know vastly more about a subject than I do, are in disagreement about said subject, to me that says the evidence is yet inconclusive.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m convinced at this point that you don&apos;t know what my hypothesis<br/>&gt; about minorness is, because you seem to misrepresent it in every<br/>&gt; conversation that we have. I think that if learned factors get your<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonic series detector&quot; to fire in a certain way in response to a<br/>&gt; chord, it&apos;ll be heard as minor, and if they fire another way, it&apos;ll be<br/>&gt; heard as major. How exactly does that conflict with anything that I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; written here?</p><p>As you&apos;ve articulated it to me, it sounds like you also believe that prior to the advent of influential &quot;learned factors&quot;, we made the major/minor distinction based on certain harmonic series features (utonality/otonality, or entropy, or your most recent term, &quot;inharmonicity&quot;).  Unless you believe that the initial/pre-cultural assignment of meaning to those qualities was random/arbitrary, it seems like you&apos;ve been arguing that those harmonic series-related qualities in some way influenced the pre-cultural assignment of meaning.  Or am I misinterpreting?  Do you believe it would have been possible for some hypothetical culture to do the opposite of us, and assign the &quot;major/happy&quot; quality to utonal/more inharmonic chords, and the &quot;minor/sad&quot; quality to otnal/more harmonic chords?  If you do, then we are in agreement.  If you don&apos;t believe that would be possible, then you&apos;re &quot;guilty as charged&quot; of assuming an absolute phonology-semantic correlation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is the concept of a key related more to the semantic content of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; language or the phonology of a sound?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d say it&apos;s part of the grammar, so it would fall into the semantic category.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In what sense is it part of the grammar? The experience of hearing a<br/>&gt; tonal center in music is a feeling, not a meaning.</p><p>It&apos;s a part of the grammar because it determines (for instance) whether a piece is major or minor, and is a product of the relationship over time of the notes in a piece.  If you&apos;re playing the white keys on a piano, the order you play them in determines whether you hear the key as C major or A minor (or whatever mode you please).  This is analogous to the way changing the order of words in a sentence alters the meaning of the sentence.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2011 6:50:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, May 17, 2011 at 6:59 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; That sort of feedback loop is what I&apos;m trying to identify as a problem<br/>&gt; &gt; in music theory.

Maybe that&apos;s why we keep butting heads. You&apos;re content to improve theory without perfecting it, whereas I&apos;m always going to harp on the imperfections and the exceptions. As a philosopher, it&apos;s my sworn duty to point out short-comings and loop-holes in any logical system I encounter.</p><p>I&apos;m content to perfect theory by continually improving it. But there&apos;s<br/>not really any loop hole that I&apos;ve seen you point out so far. In fact,<br/>if you really want to get absurdly deep with it, not only does every<br/>single thing that a person has ever experienced affect their current<br/>experience, but the universe isn&apos;t even deterministic. So just because<br/>everything a person has ever experienced affects a person&apos;s present<br/>experience doesn&apos;t mean that</p><p>1) everything they&apos;ve ever experienced affects their present<br/>experience with the same weight<br/>2) it isn&apos;t possible to draw statistical inferences about their<br/>present experience from a subset of their past experiences<br/>3) it isn&apos;t possible to take the elements that we aren&apos;t modeling and<br/>treat them as obeying a normal curve when taken in an aggregate in a<br/>population</p><p>There is nothing &quot;imperfect&quot; about the above.</p><p>Specifically, learned cues can affect how the harmonic series detector<br/>in the brain will fire, as I think we&apos;re in agreement on now. This is<br/>what I think that learned scalar structures and Rothenberg and etc are<br/>doing; they&apos;re biasing how the harmonic series detector will fire in<br/>advance - they are a set of rules that tells you what &quot;roots&quot; and even<br/>individual scale pitches to look for, just as the melody to Frere<br/>Jacques is a set of rules that tells you what &quot;roots&quot; are supposed to<br/>follow one another in the melody. By knowing these rules we can make,<br/>on some level, predictions about what will happen next in a piece of<br/>music. This whole thing about musical enjoyment being about affirming<br/>and violating predictions has been subjected to quite a lot of<br/>research, although I don&apos;t know all of the details of it.</p><p>There must therefore be some reason that 13-TET sounds particularly<br/>comprehensible although foreign, whereas many other tunings with much<br/>higher accuracy do not. That is, although 13-TET requires a training<br/>period just like any other tuning, I find that the training period is<br/>much shorter than with other tunings - Blackwood&apos;s 13-TET etude is a<br/>good example of this. To learn how to COMPOSE in 13-TET is another<br/>story entirely, but in terms of deciphering information it seems to<br/>work well. There is an inherent comprehensibility in the &quot;rules&quot; of<br/>(Blackwood&apos;s take on) 13-TET that is easily apprehended. It could be<br/>because these cues, in a sense, &quot;stay out of one another&apos;s way&quot; such<br/>that we can see the order in what&apos;s going on. Avoiding clutter in the<br/>rules is what I think needs to be studied, as well as gaining a better<br/>understanding of what the rules are. If clutter in the rules is<br/>avoided, then the signal to noise ratio will increase for the<br/>information that we&apos;re deriving from the music.</p><p>As we have currently no insight into how these cues work short of<br/>Rothenberg&apos;s ideas, which don&apos;t take harmonic series detection into<br/>account at all, then I say this is as good a starting point as any.</p><p>&gt; Are you so sure it&apos;s the theory that needs improving? I haven&apos;t run into any problems using loosely-harmonic-based harmonies within MOS structures. The only place I run aground of theory is where the theory says chords that don&apos;t well-approximate simple harmonic series relationships will sound bad. I do base my approach on the harmonic series (to an extent), I just allow a lot more leeway for mistuning than most people. It&apos;s not the end-all be-all, and the only way to get to an end-all be-all theory would be to do as you say and &quot;factor every single piece of information into the end result.&quot;</p><p>What&apos;s the point in sticking to the harmonic series, unless you&apos;re<br/>&quot;guilty as charged&quot; of what you accused me of below?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is there such a thing as a &quot;noumenal composition&quot; when you factor in<br/>&gt; &gt; that the composition was something created by a composer?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure--the composition becomes a noumenon as soon as it leaves the composer&apos;s head.</p><p>Is the noumenon the composition itself, or the performance of that composition?</p><p>&gt; &gt; We don&apos;t need to look at the full intricacies of this process in order to<br/>&gt; &gt; understand the first two parts of it, nor does the truth that these<br/>&gt; &gt; parts are coupled together necessitate that we can&apos;t divide the<br/>&gt; &gt; process into stages and look at each one separately.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, you can separate them, but it&apos;s an artificial post-hoc separation.

When I went to Paul&apos;s house, I<br/>started playing a piece on C major on his keyboard, and realized<br/>something was off. The major chords were really flat, so I asked him<br/>if the keyboard was tuned to flattone or something like that. He said<br/>it was tuned to mavila. Suddenly, I realized that the C major chord I<br/>was playing was actually C minor the whole time, e.g. that the E-G was<br/>larger than the C-E, and then there was an impressive and dramatic<br/>shift in my perception from that point on - I didn&apos;t hear it as a<br/>really flat major anymore at all, but as a minor. That was a<br/>ridiculous experience.</p><p>By the above model of minorness = tonalness, compounded with the<br/>earlier hypothesis that Rothenberg = preattentive F0 bias, that means<br/>that when I heard the minor chord as major, I was hearing that Eb as a<br/>really, really flat E, and hearing the whole thing as a really<br/>distorted 4:5:6, whereas when I heard it as &quot;minor&quot; again, I &quot;let go&quot;<br/>of the middle note and heard it as inharmonic with some kind of more<br/>dissonant relationship to the root. The tactile cue of playing C major<br/>was a &quot;rule&quot; that biased me into the first mode of perception. Is it<br/>possible for another culture to get into the habit of routinely<br/>hearing minor chords as distorted 4:5:6&apos;s? Sure, why not! And how<br/>might they guide one another&apos;s ears to that result in their tonal<br/>system? I have no idea, that&apos;s what we have no information on.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a part of the grammar because it determines (for instance) whether a piece is major or minor, and is a product of the relationship over time of the notes in a piece. If you&apos;re playing the white keys on a piano, the order you play them in determines whether you hear the key as C major or A minor (or whatever mode you please). This is analogous to the way changing the order of words in a sentence alters the meaning of the sentence.</p><p>I would say that the rules that lead one to figure out a tonal center<br/>are the grammar, but the experience of hearing the tonal center is<br/>not. Meaning that the experience of hearing the tonal center might be<br/>related to psychoacoustics, whereas the rules determine how this<br/>particular psychoacoustic experience might be instantiated.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Steve Parker &#x3C;steve@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2011 7:10:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In as much as your answer makes sense,<br/>which is no kind of mathematical sense<br/>(a Fourier transform is a model..),<br/>It is wrong!<br/>The harmonic series is a physical reality, not<br/>an ear-brain construction.<br/>Of course it&apos;s always possible to regress<br/>further into schoolboy philosophy, but the<br/>musicological journals are full of that already.</p><p>Steve P.</p><p>On 17 May 2011, at 20:00, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On Tue, May 17, 2011 at 1:58 PM, Steve Parker &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On 17 May 2011, at 18:47, Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As for your assertion that stability is rooted in the<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic series, the detection of patterns in the harmonic series is a<br/>&gt; &gt; stochastic process that is strongly influenced by learning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure what you mean by &apos;stochastic process&apos;?

The point that I&apos;m making is that talking<br/>about &quot;harmonic series&quot; as being &quot;fundamental&quot; implies the improper<br/>application of purely frequency domain-based model to the waveform<br/>going into this ear. This is not the same model that the ear applies,<br/>which is in fact a model that works based off of stochastic processes<br/>and has an element of time resolution to it, thus causing spreading in<br/>the frequency domain.

No theory is &quot;perfect&quot; until it can, from a set of initial conditions, predict the development of all that is.  None of our sciences are perfect yet, although many are still useful.</p><p>&gt; Specifically, learned cues can affect how the harmonic series detector<br/>&gt; in the brain will fire, as I think we&apos;re in agreement on now. This is<br/>&gt; what I think that learned scalar structures and Rothenberg and etc are<br/>&gt; doing; they&apos;re biasing how the harmonic series detector will fire in<br/>&gt; advance - they are a set of rules that tells you what &quot;roots&quot; and even<br/>&gt; individual scale pitches to look for, just as the melody to Frere<br/>&gt; Jacques is a set of rules that tells you what &quot;roots&quot; are supposed to<br/>&gt; follow one another in the melody. By knowing these rules we can make,<br/>&gt; on some level, predictions about what will happen next in a piece of<br/>&gt; music. This whole thing about musical enjoyment being about affirming<br/>&gt; and violating predictions has been subjected to quite a lot of<br/>&gt; research, although I don&apos;t know all of the details of it.</p><p>I agree with all this, more or less.  I think part of the problem here is that you don&apos;t understand what I&apos;m actually objecting to, perhaps because I&apos;ve been ignoring the stuff that I don&apos;t object to in my responses (for the most part).  Let me see if I can phrase my objection as succinctly as possible:</p><p>According to the premises you are advancing, the logical conclusion is that the harmonic series detector is only &quot;detecting&quot; what cultural/learned cues are telling it to detect.  Which is to say, it&apos;s a passive player in the encoding and/or processing of auditory stimuli, a mere &quot;puppet&quot; of the active player, which would be the cultural/learned &quot;preattentive&quot; stuff.  Hence appealing to harmonic series-based properties to explain things like &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; doesn&apos;t actually explain anything, because the h.s.d. seems perfectly content to ignore any &quot;actual&quot; harmonic series properties if told to do so by cultural cues.  IOW it&apos;s the cultural cues that have all the explanatory power here.  Your example of trying to play C major on Paul&apos;s mavila-tuned piano and failing to detect the minorness because the cues were so strong supports this--your h.s.d. was only detecting what the environmental cues told it to.  Of course it still sounded out-of-tune (geez, what if he had had an adaptive timbre going on--ooh, that could be a good experiment), so you asked him what was going on with the tuning, and when he told you it was Mavila, that cue told you &quot;oh, these are MINOR chords&quot; and it all snapped into place.  If he had had an adaptive timbre going on to minimize the beating, and if he had told you nothing was weird about it, how long do you think it would have taken you to figure out it was Mavila?</p><p>I guess what I&apos;m saying is that equating specific &quot;read-outs&quot; of our h.s.d.&apos;s with &quot;perception of minorness&quot; offers no explanatory power unless our h.s.d.&apos;s actually have a significant success rate of accurately perceiving harmonic series-related qualities of chords, *even in the face of confounding factors* like cultural cues.  Since the cues strong-arm the h.s.d. the majority of the time, we can safely ignore the h.s.d. and look exclusively at the cues to explain &quot;minorness&quot; and &quot;majorness&quot;.</p><p>&gt; There must therefore be some reason that 13-TET sounds particularly<br/>&gt; comprehensible although foreign, whereas many other tunings with much<br/>&gt; higher accuracy do not.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the tuning, really.  Jon Catler&apos;s &quot;Evolution for Guitar and Orchestra&quot; uses higher-limit JI in a truly masterful and comprehensible way, as does at least a few of Dante Rosati&apos;s compositions.  Kraig Grady has produced some very compelling JI work, and we know how much you loved Monz&apos;s &quot;Invisible Haircut&quot;.  Higher-limit JI can sound really fucking cool in the right hands.  Of course, the higher-accuracy regular temperaments are another story...but mostly because they haven&apos;t attracted as much compositional attention. I&apos;ll bet we *could* get some really awesome sounds out of Magic[10] and Hanson[11] if we had the right person composing in them.</p><p>&gt; That is, although 13-TET requires a training<br/>&gt; period just like any other tuning, I find that the training period is<br/>&gt; much shorter than with other tunings - Blackwood&apos;s 13-TET etude is a<br/>&gt; good example of this. To learn how to COMPOSE in 13-TET is another<br/>&gt; story entirely, but in terms of deciphering information it seems to<br/>&gt; work well. There is an inherent comprehensibility in the &quot;rules&quot; of<br/>&gt; (Blackwood&apos;s take on) 13-TET that is easily apprehended. It could be<br/>&gt; because these cues, in a sense, &quot;stay out of one another&apos;s way&quot; such<br/>&gt; that we can see the order in what&apos;s going on. Avoiding clutter in the<br/>&gt; rules is what I think needs to be studied, as well as gaining a better<br/>&gt; understanding of what the rules are. If clutter in the rules is<br/>&gt; avoided, then the signal to noise ratio will increase for the<br/>&gt; information that we&apos;re deriving from the music.</p><p>Figuring out how to do this would be great.</p><p>&gt; As we have currently no insight into how these cues work short of<br/>&gt; Rothenberg&apos;s ideas, which don&apos;t take harmonic series detection into<br/>&gt; account at all, then I say this is as good a starting point as any.</p><p>So can we drop the talk of the &quot;harmonic series detector&quot; and start trying to figure out the cues?  If so, then I&apos;m on board (at least in spirit).</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s the point in sticking to the harmonic series, unless you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &quot;guilty as charged&quot; of what you accused me of below?</p><p>Because it&apos;s worked well enough for me thus far.  Not that I &quot;stick to it&quot; in a strict or absolute sense at all, it&apos;s more that most of what I do with music can be described as &quot;loosely 5- or 7-limit&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Is the noumenon the composition itself, or the performance of that composition?</p><p>Yes.  Anything that&apos;s NOT a phenomenon is a noumenon.</p><p>&gt; Piaget&apos;s theory of child development splits the continuous process of<br/>&gt; child development into discrete &quot;stages,&quot; and it&apos;s done the world a<br/>&gt; lot of good anyway. If you want to make the stages more continuous<br/>&gt; than what I modeled above, you could throw a feedback mechanism<br/>&gt; between them. Or some research might lead to insight into how<br/>&gt; significant they are.</p><p>I think it&apos;s mainly the attitude I object to.  If you were going around saying &quot;this model works pretty well for describing what I want to describe, or at least better than available models&quot;, I&apos;d say more power to you.  But you talk about your hypotheses as if they have some higher validity beyond being somewhat useful.</p><p>&gt; Every part of Love Song that I can think of is expressible in<br/>&gt; 12-equal. In fact, the melody she&apos;s singing is loosely based around a<br/>&gt; series of modulating pentatonic scales. She sings fifths and fourths.<br/>&gt; Are those in BP?</p><p>Does she?  Your ear is better than mine, I just took it at face value that her singing was within BP.  If she&apos;s just singing 12-TET over some spacey BP chords, then that&apos;s not really very cool.</p><p>&gt; My goal is to find something that sounds &quot;radically different&quot; while<br/>&gt; still sounding immediately comprehensible. Love Song does not sound<br/>&gt; radically different. The theory that nothing that&apos;s radically<br/>&gt; different can sound immediately comprehensible is not something I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; seen proven.</p><p>Well, my thinking was that BP *is* radically different, and if it doesn&apos;t *sound* radically different, that just means the composer has done a good job of making it feel natural.  I think lots of my own music doesn&apos;t sound radically different, but it uses structures and sounds impossible in 12-TET, so I&apos;ve always taken it as a good sign that it doesn&apos;t sound unusual to me or to a lot of naive listeners.  Like I found ways to trick people into hearing something totally unusual as if it was totally familiar.</p><p>&gt; LOL, why are you arguing with me above then? I&apos;ve learned that if I<br/>&gt; just say the same in a post like four or five times, you&apos;ll generally<br/>&gt; agree with it one of those times.</p><p>You&apos;re not &quot;restating&quot; anything I&apos;ve ever disagreed with.  I&apos;ve NEVER, EVER, EVER, disagreed that &quot;higher-limit harmonies don&apos;t automatically sound comprehensible&quot;.  If anything, I&apos;ve been a most vocal proponent of the idea that extending a common-practice approach into the 11- or 13-limit is usually misguided (at best) because it usually DOES sound incomprehensible (as I have frequently said that I find Gene&apos;s music and Graham&apos;s music &quot;beyond my ability&quot; to comprehend).</p><p>&gt; ?? I&apos;m not sure how you consistently derive the opposite meaning from<br/>&gt; my sentences.</p><p>Maybe you just have a knack for obfuscating your own points, or maybe I just have a knack for re-stating my understanding of them very poorly.</p><p>&gt; - If people hear the tuning and think it sounds weird, and we<br/>&gt; predicted a different result, then we have failed, because we didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; succeed in evoking the &quot;familiar&quot; part of &quot;strange and familiar&quot; in<br/>&gt; &quot;xenharmonic.&quot;<br/>&gt; - If people hear a piece of music in a different tuning and don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; any idea that it&apos;s not the tuning they&apos;re used to, then we have also<br/>&gt; failed, because we didn&apos;t succeed in evoking the &quot;strange&quot; part of<br/>&gt; &quot;strange and familiar&quot; in &quot;xenharmonic.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve always taken the &quot;strange and familiar&quot; thing to mean tunings that ARE strange, yet SOUND familiar.  I don&apos;t think something can really sound both strange and familiar at the same time.  Strange and pleasant, strange and intriguing, strange and inspiring, strange and catchy...sure.  But by definition &quot;strange&quot; is the antonym of &quot;familiar&quot;!</p><p>&gt; - A tuning is a set of limitations, not a set of possibilities.</p><p>False dichotomy.  It&apos;s both.</p><p>&gt; - The fact that they &quot;technically don&apos;t know this&quot; isn&apos;t a bad thing,<br/>&gt; but it does mean that it&apos;s cognitively irrelevant; in the Kantian<br/>&gt; dichotomy we talked about above, it forms part of the composer&apos;s<br/>&gt; phenomenal experience of the piece, but is not part of the noumenal<br/>&gt; composition.</p><p>I&apos;d say it fails to be a part of the phenomenal experience of the listener, but is still part of the noumenal composition.</p><p>&gt; By the above model of minorness = tonalness, compounded with the<br/>&gt; earlier hypothesis that Rothenberg = preattentive F0 bias, that means<br/>&gt; that when I heard the minor chord as major, I was hearing that Eb as a<br/>&gt; really, really flat E, and hearing the whole thing as a really<br/>&gt; distorted 4:5:6, whereas when I heard it as &quot;minor&quot; again, I &quot;let go&quot;<br/>&gt; of the middle note and heard it as inharmonic with some kind of more<br/>&gt; dissonant relationship to the root. The tactile cue of playing C major<br/>&gt; was a &quot;rule&quot; that biased me into the first mode of perception. Is it<br/>&gt; possible for another culture to get into the habit of routinely<br/>&gt; hearing minor chords as distorted 4:5:6&apos;s? Sure, why not! And how<br/>&gt; might they guide one another&apos;s ears to that result in their tonal<br/>&gt; system? I have no idea, that&apos;s what we have no information on.</p><p>But what I mean is not that they&apos;d hear a minor chord as a distorted 4:5:6; I mean that a minor chord could make their h.s.d. jump exactly the same way ours does, and yet produce an opposite emotional response.

Stockhausen is pretty &quot;xenharmonic,&quot; but that&apos;s<br/>not what we&apos;re concerning ourselves with, because it&apos;s simply too<br/>different - we&apos;re trying to &quot;extend existing music&quot; into other tuning<br/>systems in a sense.</p><p>So that indicates that we&apos;re trying to find some kind of middle path<br/>between complete and utter infamiliarity and more of the same. However<br/>- this goal is subjective, not objective, because we&apos;re making<br/>reference to the concept of &quot;infamiliarity.&quot; Or, in other words, we<br/>are not studying noumenal &quot;music,&quot; but phenomenal music, and huge<br/>parts of this phenomenal music are influenced by learning.</p><p>So in light of that, when we talk about a training period being<br/>required for someone to hear a new tonal system &quot;the right way,&quot; a few<br/>things need to be noted</p><p>1) We haven&apos;t established under what conditions it is -impossible- to<br/>construct a musical event that someone can&apos;t hear a certain way with<br/>enough training.<br/>2) It is likely that such conditions don&apos;t exist, due to the human<br/>brain&apos;s capacity to adapt to extract information from a signal.<br/>3) Thus to state that a certain musical phenomenon can sound like a<br/>certain functional element of a certain larger system 4000 years from<br/>now is a zero-entropy statement.<br/>4) But that&apos;s okay, because we were never concerned with things that<br/>people could learn to like 54000 years from now. We were concerned<br/>with things that sounded strange yet familiar.<br/>5) Thus to reach the original goal, we need to figure out how to get<br/>people to hear things the new way. We need to learn how to guide<br/>people&apos;s ears to a Pajara tonal system instead of a meantone one, or<br/>whatever it is we&apos;re trying to do.<br/>6) I notice that certain scales/tunings/etc seem to be immediately<br/>comprehensible whereas other ones don&apos;t, which suggests to me that<br/>there&apos;s more to figure out.

Just because you&apos;re a<br/>&gt; &gt; philosophy major doesn&apos;t mean you can take my points and say that<br/>&gt; &gt; they&apos;re your points. That is academic plagiarism!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreement is plagiarism?</p><p>This was just a joke dude :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m content to perfect theory by continually improving it. But there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; not really any loop hole that I&apos;ve seen you point out so far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not one you&apos;re willing to consider, anyway.</p><p>I&apos;m willing to consider anything. The whole point of this post is I&apos;ve<br/>discovered a loophole in my prior thinking that I am willing to share.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is nothing &quot;imperfect&quot; about the above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure there is. No theory is &quot;perfect&quot; until it can, from a set of initial conditions, predict the development of all that is. None of our sciences are perfect yet, although many are still useful.</p><p>This seems like an arbitrary ideal; you have not proven that this has<br/>to be what a perfect theory is. Furthermore, this is an unattainable<br/>goal, as our universe is indeterministic, and as we keep learning<br/>we&apos;ll run up against that layer sooner or later, so your theory of<br/>perfectness is imperfect. Lastly, if the goal of a theory is to make<br/>statistical inferences of a probabilistic nature, and it succeeds in<br/>doing so, then it is succeeding in its objective. Quantum mechanics is<br/>a theory of such a nature and we don&apos;t have to prove that a<br/>superdeterministic interpretation is correct all at once before<br/>continuing to develop our understanding of what&apos;s going on.</p><p>&gt; According to the premises you are advancing, the logical conclusion is that the harmonic series detector is only &quot;detecting&quot; what cultural/learned cues are telling it to detect. Which is to say, it&apos;s a passive player in the encoding and/or processing of auditory stimuli, a mere &quot;puppet&quot; of the active player, which would be the cultural/learned &quot;preattentive&quot; stuff. Hence appealing to harmonic series-based properties to explain things like &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; doesn&apos;t actually explain anything, because the h.s.d. seems perfectly content to ignore any &quot;actual&quot; harmonic series properties if told to do so by cultural cues. IOW it&apos;s the cultural cues that have all the explanatory power here.</p><p>The idea wasn&apos;t that H.S.D. stuff has any explanatory power in actual<br/>predictive models. The idea was that when we say minor chords sound<br/>&quot;sad,&quot; it&apos;s not really that they sound &quot;sad,&quot; but that they have a<br/>particular ineffable quality. The particular insight here is that this<br/>quality may be the subjective experience of the HSD firing a certain<br/>way. My hypothesis, which Carl and Parncutt seem to have also<br/>advanced, is that the middle note is inharmonic and slightly intrusive<br/>from a scene analysis perspective (what has been called &quot;low<br/>tonalness&quot;). Again though, this is just a hypothesis, there may be<br/>refinements to this that make more sense.</p><p>So again, the main theory is that the actual experience of minorness<br/>is the direct experience of a certain psychoacoustic affect. Learned<br/>cues determine whether or not this happens. The point isn&apos;t that bare<br/>psychoacoustics can predict what will or will not sound minor - in<br/>fact, I&apos;m saying that&apos;s NOT possible, so although you keep arguing<br/>with your perception of me advancing this point, I&apos;m not advancing it<br/>at all. But bare psychoacoustics, combined with a better perspective<br/>on how these learned cues work, will in fact make such predictions<br/>possible - it could be that we learn how to get the HSD to fire a<br/>certain way and then HE will predict the rest, to simplify a bit.</p><p>&gt; Your example of trying to play C major on Paul&apos;s mavila-tuned piano and failing to detect the minorness because the cues were so strong supports this--your h.s.d. was only detecting what the environmental cues told it to. Of course it still sounded out-of-tune (geez, what if he had had an adaptive timbre going on--ooh, that could be a good experiment), so you asked him what was going on with the tuning, and when he told you it was Mavila, that cue told you &quot;oh, these are MINOR chords&quot; and it all snapped into place. If he had had an adaptive timbre going on to minimize the beating, and if he had told you nothing was weird about it, how long do you think it would have taken you to figure out it was Mavila?</p><p>I don&apos;t have any idea, but yes, I agree with where you are going with<br/>this and that&apos;s why I put it out there.</p><p>&gt; I guess what I&apos;m saying is that equating specific &quot;read-outs&quot; of our h.s.d.&apos;s with &quot;perception of minorness&quot; offers no explanatory power unless our h.s.d.&apos;s actually have a significant success rate of accurately perceiving harmonic series-related qualities of chords, *even in the face of confounding factors* like cultural cues.</p><p>An alternate approach is to demystify this whole &quot;cultural cues&quot;<br/>concept by learning specifically what they are and how they interact<br/>with the HSD. They could interact very strongly or very loosely. They<br/>might not interact at all, and this could all be a red herring. But<br/>it&apos;s worthwhile as a point of departure, I think.</p><p>The whole/half cue I wrote about above is a pretty good cue and a good<br/>starting point.</p><p>&gt; Since the cues strong-arm the h.s.d. the majority of the time, we can safely ignore the h.s.d. and look exclusively at the cues to explain &quot;minorness&quot; and &quot;majorness&quot;.</p><p>OK. But I&apos;d add that I think it&apos;s important to not rule the HSD out<br/>entirely. We don&apos;t have any idea what the big picture is. Just because<br/>we&apos;re moving away from the HSD for a little bit doesn&apos;t mean that we<br/>won&apos;t see the Grand Unified Theory of Everything in a few months where<br/>it all ties together. The initial hypothesis that I&apos;ve proposed is<br/>that cultural cues pre-bias the HSD to fire in a certain way. So that<br/>means that if we want to get the HSD to fire in way xxx (10:13:15), we<br/>need to find out how to create a system of cues that is comprehensible<br/>enough to to suggest doing so. It also might mean that many of the<br/>chords that we like now might not be what those chords could sound<br/>like at all in a different circumstance.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the tuning, really. Jon Catler&apos;s &quot;Evolution for Guitar and Orchestra&quot; uses higher-limit JI in a truly masterful and comprehensible way, as does at least a few of Dante Rosati&apos;s compositions. Kraig Grady has produced some very compelling JI work, and we know how much you loved Monz&apos;s &quot;Invisible Haircut&quot;. Higher-limit JI can sound really fucking cool in the right hands. Of course, the higher-accuracy regular temperaments are another story...but mostly because they haven&apos;t attracted as much compositional attention. I&apos;ll bet we *could* get some really awesome sounds out of Magic[10] and Hanson[11] if we had the right person composing in them.</p><p>OK, agreed, it has more to do with compositional technique. But it<br/>also has to do with accepting that harmonic entropy does not preclude<br/>a comprehensible cognitive structure from forming, and that the<br/>comprehensibility of the result structure is really what&apos;s important,<br/>not HE.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As we have currently no insight into how these cues work short of<br/>&gt; &gt; Rothenberg&apos;s ideas, which don&apos;t take harmonic series detection into<br/>&gt; &gt; account at all, then I say this is as good a starting point as any.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So can we drop the talk of the &quot;harmonic series detector&quot; and start trying to figure out the cues? If so, then I&apos;m on board (at least in spirit).</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;m proposing, yes. But I want to do more than just study<br/>the existing cues, I want to see what fundamentally these cues &quot;are,&quot;<br/>or else I think we&apos;ll be going nowhere. This is why I&apos;m looking for<br/>psychoacoustic correlates to the whole thing. It might just be that<br/>there&apos;s more to psychoacoustics than the raw HSD, and we&apos;ve been<br/>ignoring huge parts of it. Or it might have to do with how higher<br/>cognitive processes influence lower psychoacoustics ones (which would<br/>then be another &quot;false post-hoc separation&quot; as you laid it out<br/>earlier). Or it might have to do with an entirely different cognitive<br/>realm that has nothing to do with psychoacoustics, and appeasing the<br/>HE and Sethares curves just provides some kind of background<br/>pleasantness while the real musical substance has to do with this<br/>unknown cognitive realm.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is the noumenon the composition itself, or the performance of that composition?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Anything that&apos;s NOT a phenomenon is a noumenon.</p><p>Can an idea be a noumenon? Because while the performance of a piece of<br/>work has a noumenal vs phenomenal side to it, the composition itself<br/>is an idea. The point is that the notion of &quot;a composition&quot; includes<br/>the learned cues that the composer expects his audience to have, at<br/>least the huge general ones like key concepts and such.</p><p>&gt; I think it&apos;s mainly the attitude I object to. If you were going around saying &quot;this model works pretty well for describing what I want to describe, or at least better than available models&quot;, I&apos;d say more power to you. But you talk about your hypotheses as if they have some higher validity beyond being somewhat useful.</p><p>You know what Igs, I came up with this insight after a lot of<br/>meditation on the subejct, and started feeling like I was really onto<br/>something. I have this sense of foreboding about posting stuff like<br/>this on the list, because people</p><p>&gt; &gt; Every part of Love Song that I can think of is expressible in<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-equal. In fact, the melody she&apos;s singing is loosely based around a<br/>&gt; &gt; series of modulating pentatonic scales. She sings fifths and fourths.<br/>&gt; &gt; Are those in BP?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does she? Your ear is better than mine, I just took it at face value that her singing was within BP. If she&apos;s just singing 12-TET over some spacey BP chords, then that&apos;s not really very cool.</p><p>Yes. The chords she&apos;s playing are also basically just 12-TET chords<br/>that sound really stretched out. The fact that technically, her<br/>instrument can&apos;t play other notes that are located an octave apart<br/>from the notes that she&apos;s playing isn&apos;t anything that the audience<br/>would ever know or care about. I could also just decide to not play<br/>octaves and play the same chords in 12-TET. The chords are intoned<br/>differently, however, which does sound pretty cool.</p><p>&gt; Well, my thinking was that BP *is* radically different, and if it doesn&apos;t *sound* radically different, that just means the composer has done a good job of making it feel natural. I think lots of my own music doesn&apos;t sound radically different, but it uses structures and sounds impossible in 12-TET, so I&apos;ve always taken it as a good sign that it doesn&apos;t sound unusual to me or to a lot of naive listeners. Like I found ways to trick people into hearing something totally unusual as if it was totally familiar.</p><p>That isn&apos;t what Elaine sounded like she was doing with Love Song. It<br/>wasn&apos;t totally unusual what she was doing at all. It sounded like<br/>12-TET chords that were intoned differently, which was a cool effect.<br/>Not that it was a bad song.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re not &quot;restating&quot; anything I&apos;ve ever disagreed with. I&apos;ve NEVER, EVER, EVER, disagreed that &quot;higher-limit harmonies don&apos;t automatically sound comprehensible&quot;. If anything, I&apos;ve been a most vocal proponent of the idea that extending a common-practice approach into the 11- or 13-limit is usually misguided (at best) because it usually DOES sound incomprehensible (as I have frequently said that I find Gene&apos;s music and Graham&apos;s music &quot;beyond my ability&quot; to comprehend).</p><p>I&apos;m obliged to say here that I think that Gene&apos;s music is some of the<br/>sickest music ever written. But OK, yes, it&apos;s obviously possible to<br/>make a comprehensible system out of higher-limit harmonies. But I&apos;m<br/>starting to think the comprehensibility part is more important than<br/>the concordance part.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ?? I&apos;m not sure how you consistently derive the opposite meaning from<br/>&gt; &gt; my sentences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe you just have a knack for obfuscating your own points, or maybe I just have a knack for re-stating my understanding of them very poorly.</p><p>Probably both.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve always taken the &quot;strange and familiar&quot; thing to mean tunings that ARE strange, yet SOUND familiar. I don&apos;t think something can really sound both strange and familiar at the same time. Strange and pleasant, strange and intriguing, strange and inspiring, strange and catchy...sure. But by definition &quot;strange&quot; is the antonym of &quot;familiar&quot;!</p><p>Strange but pleasant and comprehensible, let&apos;s go with that.</p><p>&gt; But what I mean is not that they&apos;d hear a minor chord as a distorted 4:5:6; I mean that a minor chord could make their h.s.d. jump exactly the same way ours does, and yet produce an opposite emotional response. Do you believe this is possible (in one word, please)?</p><p>I don&apos;t know. You are asking me if the feeling of minorness really is<br/>the feeling of the HSD firing a certain way. I suggest that it is, but<br/>I don&apos;t know. Even if the HSD fires a certain way, it&apos;s certainly<br/>possible for a subject to be subjected to years of abuse where they<br/>get zapped with electric shocks when they hear major chords and<br/>rewarded with candy when they hear minor chords, so I guess yes.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2011 12:29:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, May 18, 2011 at 12:43 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There must therefore be some reason that 13-TET sounds particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; comprehensible although foreign, whereas many other tunings with much<br/>&gt; &gt; higher accuracy do not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are these high-accuracy tunings which allegedly do not sound comprehensible?</p><p>Porcupine did not sound immediately comprehensible to me until</p><p>1) I worked out its MODMOS&apos;s, and<br/>2) I came up with the functional excerpts</p><p>Now I really &quot;get it,&quot; I didn&apos;t before.

The fact that there were two whole<br/>tones was also pretty baffling. I think it was because I was trying to<br/>fit the 160 cent motion into a template for 9/8, i.e. hear it as a<br/>nicely resonant and otonal interval. Instead I was hearing something<br/>altogether different entirely. I&apos;ve started to learn to hear that<br/>interval as a combination of 11/10 and 12/11, but it&apos;s another<br/>challenge to separate 10/9 from 9/8 in my head, and hear 10/9 as being<br/>the same as 12/11 and 11/10.</p><p>Keep in mind that everything you&apos;re trying to accomplish with<br/>porcupine in this example is dependent on having a particular type of<br/>hearing set up that you already have - you can make predictions with<br/>the material because not only did you write it, but you understand<br/>porcupine.

I suspect melodic cues might be more important in comprehensibility than harmonic ones.  This isn&apos;t just about consecutive scale-steps but also things like motion by major 3rds or perfect 5ths, too.  I suspect the reason I&apos;ve never liked Porcupine is because in the MOS&apos;s, there are almost no familiar cues anywhere.  You can&apos;t do a I-IV-V, AND the melodic steps are all right between whole-tone and semitone.  At least in Mavila you can play a I-IV-V and if you leave the fifth out it sounds perfectly pedestrian.  Scales like Magic[10] and Hanson[11] are similarly devoid of familiar melodic cues.  Maybe that explains my preferences?  I used to think having pairs of triads that span the same outer interval but flip the middle interval and act as sort of &quot;yin/yang&quot; dualities was important, but you get that in Porcupine and it doesn&apos;t seem to help me much.</p><p>&gt; 7) If it really turns out that some tonal system simply just requires<br/>&gt; decades of training to hear properly, that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s musically<br/>&gt; useless, but it&apos;s worth knowing that this is the case.</p><p>I don&apos;t think anything would take decades.

They could interact very strongly or very loosely. They<br/>&gt; might not interact at all, and this could all be a red herring. But<br/>&gt; it&apos;s worthwhile as a point of departure, I think.</p><p>Tell ya what: figuring out how they interact with the H.S.D. is going to require neuroimaging.  At present the role of the H.S.D. in musical perception is so heavily infused with speculation it upsets me to talk about it, because you can&apos;t settle speculation with more speculation.  Until there is evidence that some area of the brain lights up the same way when it hears a 12-TET major chord as it does when it hears a full harmonic series, and that it lights up the same way when it hears a 12-TET minor chord as it does when it hears a full subharmonic series, I will not be convinced one way or another about the relationship of the H.S.D. to chord quality perception.</p><p>Cultural cues, on the other hand, are much easier to manipulate.  We just keep doing what many have done before us: analyze familiar music and try to extract regularities that might serve as cues, isolate each of those cues, alter them, and see how that affects musical perception.  That we can do, so let&apos;s do it.</p><p>&gt; OK, agreed, it has more to do with compositional technique. But it<br/>&gt; also has to do with accepting that harmonic entropy does not preclude<br/>&gt; a comprehensible cognitive structure from forming, and that the<br/>&gt; comprehensibility of the result structure is really what&apos;s important,<br/>&gt; not HE.</p><p>Absolutely, 100% in agreement.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s what I&apos;m proposing, yes. But I want to do more than just study<br/>&gt; the existing cues, I want to see what fundamentally these cues &quot;are,&quot;<br/>&gt; or else I think we&apos;ll be going nowhere. This is why I&apos;m looking for<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic correlates to the whole thing. It might just be that<br/>&gt; there&apos;s more to psychoacoustics than the raw HSD, and we&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; ignoring huge parts of it. Or it might have to do with how higher<br/>&gt; cognitive processes influence lower psychoacoustics ones (which would<br/>&gt; then be another &quot;false post-hoc separation&quot; as you laid it out<br/>&gt; earlier). Or it might have to do with an entirely different cognitive<br/>&gt; realm that has nothing to do with psychoacoustics, and appeasing the<br/>&gt; HE and Sethares curves just provides some kind of background<br/>&gt; pleasantness while the real musical substance has to do with this<br/>&gt; unknown cognitive realm.</p><p>I think the easiest ways to figure out what these cues are is to experiment with removing or altering them until we&apos;ve stripped them down to their essential properties.</p><p>&gt; Can an idea be a noumenon?</p><p>No.  Ideas are the very essence of phenomena.</p><p>&gt; Because while the performance of a piece of<br/>&gt; work has a noumenal vs phenomenal side to it, the composition itself<br/>&gt; is an idea. The point is that the notion of &quot;a composition&quot; includes<br/>&gt; the learned cues that the composer expects his audience to have, at<br/>&gt; least the huge general ones like key concepts and such.</p><p>The composition is only an idea if it&apos;s in someone&apos;s head.  Otherwise it&apos;s just marks on paper, data on a CD, grooves on a record.  Whatever attendant ideas the composition has in someone&apos;s head, that&apos;s part of its phenomenology.</p><p>&gt; You know what Igs, I came up with this insight after a lot of<br/>&gt; meditation on the subejct, and started feeling like I was really onto<br/>&gt; something.</p><p>One thing I heard over and over again from chemistry teachers, psych teachers, and philosophy of science teachers is that doing science means constantly doing everything you can to prove yourself wrong.  If you fail to prove yourself wrong despite your best efforts, then you might have something with scientific merit.  So next time you get that feeling that you&apos;re &quot;on to something&quot;, I suggest you do what I do when I get the same feeling: try to find exceptions, contradictions, anything that would &quot;burst your bubble&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Yes. The chords she&apos;s playing are also basically just 12-TET chords<br/>&gt; that sound really stretched out. The fact that technically, her<br/>&gt; instrument can&apos;t play other notes that are located an octave apart<br/>&gt; from the notes that she&apos;s playing isn&apos;t anything that the audience<br/>&gt; would ever know or care about. I could also just decide to not play<br/>&gt; octaves and play the same chords in 12-TET. The chords are intoned<br/>&gt; differently, however, which does sound pretty cool.</p><p>What about the fact that in BP, there are no whole-tones or semitones?  It&apos;s not the lack of octaves that throws me with BP, but the lack of familiar melodic patterns.  Also, the chords can&apos;t move by familiar steps, either, because there&apos;s no 3/2 or 4/3 or 5/4.  If she&apos;s cheating with the melody, that&apos;s one thing, but you can&apos;t cheat with the chord progressions.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m obliged to say here that I think that Gene&apos;s music is some of the<br/>&gt; sickest music ever written.</p><p>I agree, but I&apos;m a few decades away from being able to comprehend it fully. ;-&gt;</p><p>&gt; But OK, yes, it&apos;s obviously possible to<br/>&gt; make a comprehensible system out of higher-limit harmonies. But I&apos;m<br/>&gt; starting to think the comprehensibility part is more important than<br/>&gt; the concordance part.</p><p>*Ding-ding-ding-ding*  We have a winner!</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know. You are asking me if the feeling of minorness really is<br/>&gt; the feeling of the HSD firing a certain way. I suggest that it is, but<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Then until we have a way of experimentally testing, can we agree to leave it at &quot;pending further investigation&quot;?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2011 2:11:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, May 18, 2011 at 5:05 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Wed, May 18, 2011 at 4:46 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Night on Porcupine Mountain sounded incomprehensible and non-functional?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/NightOnPorcupineMountain/Genewardsmithmussorgsky-NightOnPorcupineMountain.mp3">http://www.archive.org/download/NightOnPorcupineMountain/Genewardsmithmussorgsky-NightOnPorcupineMountain.mp3</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Part of the idea of this was to demonstrate some of the functional possibilities inherent in porcupine by sheer overwhelming force, so if that didn&apos;t work for you I didn&apos;t completely succeed.</p><p>Actually, on repeated listen, this is blowing my mind now.

You seem to agree below<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep. I believe any system that contains at least one of the strong cues we&apos;re used to will sound more initially comprehensible than one that doesn&apos;t. I suspect melodic cues might be more important in comprehensibility than harmonic ones. This isn&apos;t just about consecutive scale-steps but also things like motion by major 3rds or perfect 5ths, too. I suspect the reason I&apos;ve never liked Porcupine is because in the MOS&apos;s, there are almost no familiar cues anywhere. You can&apos;t do a I-IV-V</p><p>I am obliged to say here that sometimes we need to DITCH the MOS&apos;s and<br/>move on. There are three MODMOS&apos;s of note here - the one where you<br/>flat the fourth to give you 4/3 instead of 11/8, the one where you<br/>sharpen the 7th to give you 15/8 instead of 11/6, and the one where<br/>you do both, which lands you at a porcupine-tempered JI major scale.<br/>&quot;Sharpening&quot; means movement by 1\22, which is L-s in porcupine[7]. If<br/>you do what I said above, you now have the option to move to the IV<br/>and the V chords, but it just requires modulating the scale that<br/>you&apos;re using. This is fine, because it&apos;s the same thing that we do<br/>with minor in 12-equal; we have three minor scales and switch between<br/>them as necessary. In fact, we even throw Dorian and Phrygian in there<br/>these days too sometimes.</p><p>If you start experimenting with the larger structure of the<br/>JI-tempered porcupine lattice, and start thinking in terms of<br/>generalized structures like I-IV-V, you&apos;ll find that 81/80 now equals<br/>25/24, and this equivalence will enable you to modulate around the<br/>lattice in a way that sounds like &quot;common practice&quot; music, except<br/>you&apos;ll be able to take advantage of different comma pumps than we&apos;re<br/>used to (and the ones we&apos;re used to won&apos;t work). Go ahead and try it -<br/>use V-I and IV-I resolutions and just move continuously wherever you<br/>want. Use secondary dominants (if you know what those are). Use 16/9<br/>as a dominant 7, which for porcupine is the same as 7/4. You&apos;ll see<br/>what I mean. <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/functionalporcupineexcerpt">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/functionalporcupineexcerpt</a></p><p>Hooray, but what about modes? Come Together only sounds cool and<br/>detached because it&apos;s in Dorian mode. What other ridiculous moods<br/>might be lurking behind the modes of porcupine? I don&apos;t know, because<br/>the MOS&apos;s behind the modes of porcupine[7] suck. I&apos;m still trying to<br/>work it out. Petr has the concept better than I do.</p><p>&gt; AND the melodic steps are all right between whole-tone and semitone. At least in Mavila you can play a I-IV-V and if you leave the fifth out it sounds perfectly pedestrian. Scales like Magic[10] and Hanson[11] are similarly devoid of familiar melodic cues. Maybe that explains my preferences? I used to think having pairs of triads that span the same outer interval but flip the middle interval and act as sort of &quot;yin/yang&quot; dualities was important, but you get that in Porcupine and it doesn&apos;t seem to help me much.</p><p>I have come to the conclusion that Father[8] is awesome because it<br/>consists only of whole steps and half steps, whereas porcupine has<br/>these weird 160 cent steps that sound very strange on first listen.<br/>Now that I&apos;ve heard them a million times though, I think they sound<br/>awesome. But we need to find a better way to guide people&apos;s 12-tet<br/>ears to hearing these 160 cent steps as natural.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 7) If it really turns out that some tonal system simply just requires<br/>&gt; &gt; decades of training to hear properly, that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s musically<br/>&gt; &gt; useless, but it&apos;s worth knowing that this is the case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think anything would take decades. Give me a few months of forcing me to play ONLY Porcupine and I&apos;m sure I&apos;d naturalize it eventually.</p><p>I think 2 days of playing with Porcupine and its MODMOS&apos;s and you&apos;ll<br/>get it. OK, since I keep dropping this cryptic &quot;MODMOS&quot; reference,<br/>I&apos;ll let you in on the secret: for porcupine[7] in 22-equal, the<br/>alteration of ANY single note in the scale by 1\22 will lead you to a<br/>MODMOS of porcupine[7] that is proper. I think alterations to any two<br/>notes will also lead to a proper MOS. However, since we&apos;re currently<br/>reconsidering the entire concept of propriety, for now I&apos;d say just<br/>alter any note you want and let your ears guide you. So basically the<br/>rule is</p><p>- Start with porcupine[7]<br/>- The base major mode is Lssssss<br/>- Sharp or flat any note you want<br/>- This means if you want to play something sounding like 1/1 - 9/8 -<br/>5/4 - 4/3, just flatten that 4th degree by 1\22 and JUST DO IT. Don&apos;t<br/>worry about sticking to the MOS<br/>- You will immediately &quot;get&quot; porcupine because there&apos;s nothing to get,<br/>it&apos;s just music and you can now do whatever you want, but have the<br/>added option of playing porcupine 3ED4/3 licks whenever you want</p><p>&gt; But anyway your point is valid. It&apos;s harder to get one&apos;s head around a 23-note MOS or a 27-note Hobbit than it is around a 7-note or a 10-note MOS, both as listener and composer. Unless you&apos;re Gene, in which case the sky&apos;s the limit! Or Catler, and his 64-tone JI guitar...I have no idea how he keeps his bearings on that thing, really. It would drive me mad to try to keep track of what note I was actually playing.</p><p>I think that wrapping ones head around a 23-note MOS might just mean<br/>wrapping ones head around a 7-note MOS and then also learning a set of<br/>rules for how to modulate chromatically outside of that MOS.</p><p>&gt; &gt; - This cause would only be served by understanding what exactly this<br/>&gt; &gt; additional level of order going on under the hood is<br/>&gt; &gt; - This cause would only be served by understanding how to guide people<br/>&gt; &gt; towards a new system<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, like I said above--I think it&apos;s the case that there are a lot of different cues in &quot;normal&quot; music, and finding systems that preserve the minimal necessary amount of them while introducing any number of new elements is a good way to go.</p><p>And also learning how to get people to hear porcupine as natural in<br/>some kind of Overture fashion. What do you think of<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/functionalporcupineexcerpt">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/functionalporcupineexcerpt</a>?</p><p>&gt; &gt; This seems like an arbitrary ideal; you have not proven that this has<br/>&gt; &gt; to be what a perfect theory is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How could it be anything else?</p><p>I don&apos;t know, what does &quot;perfect&quot; mean? You are invoking this concept<br/>as an objection to a direction I suggest that folks round here<br/>consider. You seem to be objecting to the development of a more<br/>accurate but perhaps indeterministic theory because it&apos;s imperfect,<br/>and it&apos;s imperfect because it&apos;s indeterministic, and only things that<br/>are deterministic can be perfect because perfect can&apos;t be anything<br/>else. I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, this is an unattainable<br/>&gt; &gt; goal, as our universe is indeterministic, and as we keep learning<br/>&gt; &gt; we&apos;ll run up against that layer sooner or later, so your theory of<br/>&gt; &gt; perfectness is imperfect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, it&apos;s just the universe that is imperfect. Who said perfection had to be attainable?</p><p>I actually think that the indeterministic element of the universe<br/>makes it perfect.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Lastly, if the goal of a theory is to make<br/>&gt; &gt; statistical inferences of a probabilistic nature, and it succeeds in<br/>&gt; &gt; doing so, then it is succeeding in its objective. Quantum mechanics is<br/>&gt; &gt; a theory of such a nature and we don&apos;t have to prove that a<br/>&gt; &gt; superdeterministic interpretation is correct all at once before<br/>&gt; &gt; continuing to develop our understanding of what&apos;s going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perfection implies improvement is impossible. So long as a theory is less than maximally-accurate in its predictions, there&apos;s room for a more accurate theory to come along. If there is no &quot;maximum&quot; of accuracy, then there will ALWAYS be room for a better theory, ergo perfection is impossible. Note that the maximum doesn&apos;t have to be 100% accuracy. And in any case no theory is ever &quot;proven&quot;. Nothing is ever certain in science, just (increasingly) more confident.</p><p>OK, so I&apos;m saying let&apos;s make things more confident. You&apos;re saying that<br/>you&apos;re not down unless we can actually make it perfect, but by your<br/>above reasoning it can&apos;t be perfect, so you want something that as per<br/>what you just said above couldn&apos;t possibly exist. So I&apos;m confused.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The idea wasn&apos;t that H.S.D. stuff has any explanatory power in actual<br/>&gt; &gt; predictive models.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, good then.</p><p>But HSD stuff + learned factor stuff might well have explanatory power<br/>in a way that just learned factor stuff might now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The idea was that when we say minor chords sound<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;sad,&quot; it&apos;s not really that they sound &quot;sad,&quot; but that they have a<br/>&gt; &gt; particular ineffable quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope you mean &quot;chords that are perceived as minor&quot;, because your experience on Paul&apos;s keyboard effed pretty much all the qualities of a minor chord.</p><p>Yes, I mean &quot;minorness&quot; in the sense of the end perception being what<br/>we&apos;d typically call &quot;minor.&quot; There is no noumenal minor chord, but<br/>there is a noumenal phenomenon that may produce the phenomenon of<br/>minorness. Or rather the noumenal minor chord is related to the<br/>phenomenon of minorness only through the statistical probability that<br/>said phenomenon will be produced in a population of listeners.</p><p>&gt; &gt; An alternate approach is to demystify this whole &quot;cultural cues&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; concept by learning specifically what they are and how they interact<br/>&gt; &gt; with the HSD. They could interact very strongly or very loosely. They<br/>&gt; &gt; might not interact at all, and this could all be a red herring. But<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s worthwhile as a point of departure, I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tell ya what: figuring out how they interact with the H.S.D. is going to require neuroimaging.</p><p>I think some really cleverly devised examples might also be able to do<br/>it. Stay tuned for a listening test coming up. It&apos;s just a puzzle to<br/>have to solve. Also, let&apos;s come back to the neuroimaging subject in a<br/>few years and see if I can swing the hookup :)</p><p>But hey, some of these studies I linked you to actually HAVE<br/>neuroimaging in them, so that might work out.</p><p>&gt; Cultural cues, on the other hand, are much easier to manipulate. We just keep doing what many have done before us: analyze familiar music and try to extract regularities that might serve as cues, isolate each of those cues, alter them, and see how that affects musical perception. That we can do, so let&apos;s do it.</p><p>OK. For starters, father temperament is made up of whole steps and<br/>half steps, and two whole steps makes a major third, and a whole step<br/>plus a half step makes a minor third. That seems to be important, and<br/>I can bias which interval in father[8] sounds like a &quot;fifth&quot; based on<br/>that. For example, doing w-w-h-w up from the root sounds like I&apos;m<br/>tracing out a major scale, despite that the note I end on is the ~650<br/>cent interval. And then doing w-h-w-h DOWN from the octave up from the<br/>root sounds like I&apos;m ending on the tritone from the root, despite that<br/>it&apos;s the same note that I laid out above. I&apos;ll come up with some<br/>13-tet improvs on my iPhone to demo these concepts.</p><p>&gt; I think the easiest ways to figure out what these cues are is to experiment with removing or altering them until we&apos;ve stripped them down to their essential properties.</p><p>It seems to me to have to do with a learned system of logic that tells<br/>the HSD how to fire. Two whole steps puts you at a major third. The<br/>way my fingers fit on a keyboard has to do with this system of logic<br/>as well, and one of the neuroimaging studies I linked you to showed<br/>that when the lips of trumpet players were stimulated, something about<br/>the topological representation of notes in the brain were activated. I<br/>didn&apos;t have the link to the fulltext of that study so if your<br/>university has the hookup for you, maybe you can find it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can an idea be a noumenon?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. Ideas are the very essence of phenomena.</p><p>Then there is no such thing as a phenomenal composition, just a<br/>phenomenal performance of it. And furthermore, a composition also<br/>includes the cues that the listener is supposed to use to decode the<br/>composition to extract information. This discussion has moved on so<br/>much since I first introduced this point I don&apos;t remember why this was<br/>significant any more.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You know what Igs, I came up with this insight after a lot of<br/>&gt; &gt; meditation on the subejct, and started feeling like I was really onto<br/>&gt; &gt; something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I heard over and over again from chemistry teachers, psych teachers, and philosophy of science teachers is that doing science means constantly doing everything you can to prove yourself wrong. If you fail to prove yourself wrong despite your best efforts, then you might have something with scientific merit. So next time you get that feeling that you&apos;re &quot;on to something&quot;, I suggest you do what I do when I get the same feeling: try to find exceptions, contradictions, anything that would &quot;burst your bubble&quot;.</p><p>I still haven&apos;t found anything contradicting the core idea behind what<br/>I&apos;ve laid out here, although my position has evolved somewhat due to<br/>your feedback. But I&apos;m not even sure what I&apos;ve stumbled on yet, much<br/>less the final synthesis of it into a concrete statement. That&apos;s why I<br/>posted my thoughts on it so far here for critical feedback.</p><p>&gt; What about the fact that in BP, there are no whole-tones or semitones? It&apos;s not the lack of octaves that throws me with BP, but the lack of familiar melodic patterns. Also, the chords can&apos;t move by familiar steps, either, because there&apos;s no 3/2 or 4/3 or 5/4. If she&apos;s cheating with the melody, that&apos;s one thing, but you can&apos;t cheat with the chord progressions.</p><p>My brain puts a whole-tone/semitone background behind everything she<br/>plays, and she never plays anything that violates that perception. The<br/>fact that her choice of instrument doesn&apos;t enable her to play those<br/>things isn&apos;t something that would be apparent to a listener.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m obliged to say here that I think that Gene&apos;s music is some of the<br/>&gt; &gt; sickest music ever written.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree, but I&apos;m a few decades away from being able to comprehend it fully. ;-&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m also obliged to say here that &quot;sick&quot; means &quot;good,&quot; just like<br/>&quot;ridiculous&quot; means &quot;interesting. Again have I spake in the vernacular<br/>of my youth.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know. You are asking me if the feeling of minorness really is<br/>&gt; &gt; the feeling of the HSD firing a certain way. I suggest that it is, but<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then until we have a way of experimentally testing, can we agree to leave it at &quot;pending further investigation&quot;?</p><p>Stay tuned...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2011 3:04:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, May 18, 2011 at 5:49 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you&apos;re right about the melodic cues sounding familiar but adding up &quot;wrong&quot;...like how playing 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 still leaves room for another semitone.<br/>&gt; Try playing a melody harmonized in parallel 3rds in 13&apos;s Father[8], which isn&apos;t really Father but actually this unnamed temperament:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=2ccd_3cd&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=2ccd_3cd&limit=7</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (commas are 28/27 and 4096/3645, by my reckoning anyway, and this connects 13, 18, and 23 among others in the 7-limit).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Parallel 3rds in this scale blow my mind every time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. if no one&apos;s named it, can we call it &quot;Uncle&quot; temperament?</p><p>Yeah, you I think suggested the mapping in my response to this here</p><p><a href="http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/96071">http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/96071</a></p><p>It&apos;s also 5&amp;18, which is here</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=5_18&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=5_18&limit=7</a></p><p>We can call it Uncle.

If you fail to prove yourself wrong despite your best efforts, then you might have something with scientific merit. So next time you get that feeling that you&apos;re &quot;on to something&quot;, I suggest you do what I do when I get the same feeling: try to find exceptions, contradictions, anything that would &quot;burst your bubble&quot;.</p><p>You said something like this in the email prior as well, that this new<br/>notion isn&apos;t anything different from what people have been saying, or<br/>that the idea behind it isn&apos;t rooted in an advancement of the<br/>paradigm. So here&apos;s basically the whole thing summed up in five<br/>succinct bullet points:</p><p>1) &quot;Xenharmonic&quot; music is a relative, subjective, phenomenal term that<br/>describes a particular musical experience that we&apos;re trying to evoke<br/>in a certain observer; the experience of having seen a little bit more<br/>of the universe or however you want to think of it.</p><p>2) &quot;Xenharmonic&quot; music isn&apos;t going to be &quot;xenharmonic&quot; at all in a few<br/>hundred years when we&apos;re all used to it. &quot;Xenharmonic&quot; music isn&apos;t<br/>&quot;xenharmonic&quot; unless someone actually perceives it as xenharmonic.</p><p>3) The claim that someone can get used to a certain tonal system if<br/>one just stops bitching about it might be true, but then again so is<br/>the claim that one can get used to 13-equal and beating and high-error<br/>tunings if they get over the periodicity buzz crack habit.</p><p>4) BUT, neither of the above claims have anything to do with anything.<br/>They tautologically indicate the -potential- xenharmonicness of a<br/>system for an observer. All they say that it may be possible for an<br/>observer to experience a certain phenomenon differently than they do<br/>now, WHICH ISN&apos;T SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL AND PUTS US BACK AT SQUARE<br/>ONE. We still haven&apos;t explained how to create the xenharmonic feeling<br/>in that observer, which was the whole point of this entire field of<br/>study to begin with, so we&apos;ve gotten nowhere.</p><p>5) Read again: We still haven&apos;t explained how to create the<br/>xenharmonic feeling in that observer, which was the whole point of<br/>this entire field of study to begin with, so we&apos;ve gotten nowhere.<br/>Thus to advance the study of &quot;xenharmonic&quot; music, we&apos;d have to learn<br/>how to guide people to hearing things in a different way.</p><p>If you&apos;re telling me that this is something that people have been<br/>saying all along, or that this train of thought isn&apos;t rooted in any<br/>sort of insight, I don&apos;t know what to tell you. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s<br/>necessary to be so overbearingly modest that we have to pretend that<br/>nobody can have insights into things.

All the practice in the world isn&apos;t going to help me<br/>figure that out if I&apos;m stuck in a box of preconceptions. Revising my<br/>own internal theory helps me get over those preconceptions.

It should sound like the diminished scale in<br/>12-equal - e.g. C D Eb F F# G# A B - except the B puts you back at C<br/>again. Machine:Diatonic::Keemun:Diminished. Furthermore, there&apos;s a<br/>4:7:11 right over the tonic of this triad. Almost every 12-tet person<br/>I&apos;ve played this scale for has liked it immediately. I actually like<br/>it better than the 12-equal diminished scale, it&apos;s way cooler.

Especially jazz musicians who can<br/>run circles around 12-tet in their heads and then find that all of the<br/>familiar pathways no longer work.

Since you don&apos;t care so much<br/>about error, I don&apos;t see why badness matters. Complexity I can see<br/>mattering. So perhaps complexity is what is important, since the<br/>concept of &quot;error&quot; is one of those things that&apos;s subject to learned<br/>factors. But complexity determines how many different harmonic<br/>components can be connected in crazy different ways in a tuning&apos;s MOS.<br/>So maybe that&apos;s what we&apos;re looking at here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2011 2:37:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&nbsp;It&apos;s pretty much just you and me who&apos;ve expressed anything like<br/>&gt; &quot;immediate appeal&quot; of Father/Uncle[8].</p><p>Igs, do you have any samples of Father/Uncle that you like that I<br/>could listen to?

In fact, most scales<br/>where the generator isn&apos;t something like 3/2 end up sounding really<br/>sinister and what not. Which is fine, if that&apos;s what you want. It also<br/>means that the melody and the harmony don&apos;t have to come from the same<br/>scale.</p><p>&gt; As everyone knows, I *heavily* favor simplicity over accuracy, and it&apos;s sounding like you&apos;re coming around to that way, too.</p><p>I&apos;ve been around that way for a long time.

Now work with this seq file, adjusting enharmonic equivalences until you&apos;ve got a satisfactory 31-et version of the piece. This you then remap to mavila. I&apos;d suggest the lazy approach to start out with, and it doesn&apos;t mean you are confined to retuning music from the 15-17th centuries. Scrutinize what chords your piece is using and find something which will work.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2011 7:04:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; OK, I&apos;ll do it.
