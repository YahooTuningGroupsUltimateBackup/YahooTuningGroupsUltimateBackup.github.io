Does anyone have any tips about this, or any<br/>&gt; other micro-refret advice?<br/>&gt; How about the upper octave,<br/>&gt; will the frets be impossibly close together? Has anyone<br/>&gt; done an &quot;every-other-fret&quot;, or switched temperments for<br/>&gt; the upper octave?</p><p>My classical Kohno guitar has been refretted into 24tet in Paris by Antoine<br/>Pappalardo. His idea was to use mandolin frets, mainly for aesthetic<br/>reasons. However the guitar last a considerable part of it&apos;s sustain after<br/>the refretting. I suspect there is a relation between the form of the<br/>fretwire and the way the string vibrates. For example the Indian sitar would<br/>have very little sustain if it&apos;s bridge would not have it&apos;s special shape.<br/>Mandolin frets are almost square, while normal guitar frets have a rounder<br/>form. For electric guitar even exists the &apos;jumbo&apos;-fret, round and very<br/>large.</p><p>The other reason for the loss of sustain might be that the neck has last<br/>part of it&apos;s flexibility, having twice as much frets.</p><p>I doubt if there is a real link between the shape of the fret and there<br/>being close together. All the left hand fingers have to do is to establish a<br/>contact between the fret and the string. There is no need at all to press<br/>the string against the wood of the neck. Frets can be really tight if the<br/>neck has a good regular action and if the strings are not set too low at the<br/>bridge.</p><p>The &apos;number one&apos; 31tet guitar, produced with primitive means by Adriaan<br/>Fokker before or during WW II, has got steel strings, fixed on a<br/>Martin-model guitar. Extremely tiny frets with square tops. Very little<br/>sustain.</p><p>It may be useful to put markings on the side of the neck and not in between<br/>the frets or by using he frets themselves. You&apos;ll probably have to watch<br/>your fingers a lot. And that provokes a very bad angle for your playing<br/>position.</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
