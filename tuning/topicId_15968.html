The<br/>preliminary results I&apos;m hearing are quite exciting!</p><p>The bad news: I&apos;m still using pitch bending, to tap into the General<br/>MIDI standard as before, which has no provision for tuning tables.  This<br/>does put channels at a premium, and means that very dense sequences<br/>can&apos;t be accommodated.  BUT, by dynamically reassigning channels to the<br/>voices currently in use, I&apos;ve been pleasantly surprised to find that<br/>some fairly dense tunes DO fit!  I&apos;ll post some examples soon.</p><p>An interesting observation so far: I&apos;m going to tighter vertical<br/>springs than I usually use for piano voice alone, and finding, to my<br/>ear at least, the resulting horizontal motions not to be troubling.  I<br/>don&apos;t know why this is, and don&apos;t know if others will share my<br/>observations.</p><p>Monz, I&apos;ve got the Schoenberg retuned to 7 and to 13; shall I send these<br/>to you?  I think both sound nice!</p><p>I invite anyone with multiple-voice GM midi sequences to forward them to<br/>me, to see how well the program does.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=16202 href="#16202">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2000 9:45:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15968">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15968</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Over Thanksgiving holiday, I worked on enhancing my adaptive<br/>&gt; retuning program so as to be able to handle sequences with<br/>&gt; multiple voices.
