I<br/>&gt;saw him, and a bunch of Luthiers who paid it at a convention a few months<br/>&gt;ago in California.  That&apos;s what patents are all about.</p><p>I thought that&apos;s what copyrights were about, patents granting one the sole<br/>right to manufacture.</p><p>&gt;I believe that Catler and Lucy have similar arrangements.</p><p>That&apos;s priceless!  Good luck, boys!  See you in St. Lois!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
