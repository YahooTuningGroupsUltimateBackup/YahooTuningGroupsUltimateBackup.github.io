I decided to subscribe from another account, non-digest mode, to see for myself. What I get are properly formed messages, with full headers (i.e. From, To, Subject, etc.).</p><p>If anyone else is having a problem, it may be other than eGroups (or Onelist, whichever it is called...). A couple of weeks ago I found that I wasn&apos;t getting the digest, and a call to tech support at my ISP found that they had problems from Onelist. Tracked it down and had it fixed in a day, so maybe the solution is downstream a bit.</p><p>Oh yeah: hear hear for list etiquette. Minor amount of work for maximum pleasure for the readers of your messages...</p><p>More on real tuning issues later!<br/>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/> Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                          <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
