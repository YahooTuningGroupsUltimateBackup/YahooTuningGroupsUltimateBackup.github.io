This is what we need to do. If a bunch of us look at the<br/>&gt; spectrograms of 1)A capella vocal recordings, both solo and ensemble, and 2)<br/>&gt; Unaccompanied strings, from violin solo to string quartet to string<br/>&gt; orchestra, I believe some light may be shed on some of the issues we hold<br/>&gt; dear here.</p><p>Hello, Dante</p><p>In this regard, I strongly suggest that you or someone do a spectrogram<br/>analysis of a performance of the opening of the 3rd movement (first 4+<br/>minutes) of Beethoven&apos;s String Quartet no. 15, Opus 132, as recorded by<br/>the Fitzwilliam String Quartet on London 411 643-2.  There is no doubt<br/>in my mind that the performers strived to do at least a 5-limit JI<br/>tuning of this passage (and perhaps even a few 7-limit dominant chords)<br/>in a senza vibrato style.  The &apos;cellist is a little high on some of his<br/>3rds, but the violist is right on the money.  I never thought this<br/>rendition sounded &quot;un-Beethoven&quot;ish - I think if he would have been able<br/>to hear it this way (and maybe he did in his brain), he would have liked<br/>it.</p><p>- Fred Reinagel</p></div>
