If a dominant<br/>seventh chord is not very dissonant, then F-B-D# is not very dissonant<br/>also, and this is doubly true if we abandon the assumption that the<br/>music is being played in 12-equal--and since this is the middle of the<br/>nineteenth century, that is a good assumption to abandon.</p><p>The E-G#-D-A# chord following the Tristan chord might reasonably be<br/>spelled E-G#-Cx-A# instead. In this case, it becomes a magic chord of<br/>meantone; it can be regarded, once again, septimally; as<br/>1-5/4-7/4-14/5, where the 5/4-14/5 interval, adjusted by 225/224, is<br/>actually a 9/4. Hence the intervals in the chord are {5/4, 7/5, 8/5,<br/>7/4, 9/4, 14/5} and it is a 9-limit consonant magic chord in meantone<br/>(or miracle, for that matter.) This chord is clearly root at E, and<br/>the Tristan chord contains a minor chord rooted at G#, a major third<br/>above E. Hence the whole progression makes perfectly good sense as<br/>dominant harmony: first A, F, E establishes A as tonic; then we get a<br/>chord with a relation of a major third to the dominant E, progressing<br/>to another chord with a strong E flavor, then to E7.</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;tdent@auth.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2005 6:02:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;tdent@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>(...)<br/>&gt; &gt; If you try to play<br/>&gt; &gt; it in some kind of meantone, that conclusion is more or less<br/>&gt; &gt; invalidated and the chord becomes just a funny dissonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is NOT a dissonance in anything which is close to 2/9 comma<br/>&gt; meantone.

(Perhaps I do find it alien in 1/4<br/>comma.) But I do claim that the chord F-B-D#-G# itself is, as a chord<br/>in A minor, no matter what the tuning, alien to common practice,<br/>since it superimposes the aug 4th pre-dominant function and the<br/>leading-note dominant function, resulting in a consonance (D#-G#)<br/>where a dissonance (D#-A) would be in a standard French 6th<br/>progression.

The 1797 Britannica<br/>described a modified 1/5-comma (with the wolf distributed over two<br/>sharp fifths) as &quot;better adapted than any other for keyed<br/>instruments&quot;, and Jorgensen seems to think that 1/5-comma or modified<br/>versions thereof retained a large following well into the 19th<br/>century. Hawkes in 1807 described his temperament as &quot;substracting<br/>one-fifth of a [syntonic] comma from a certain number of perfect<br/>fifths...and to tune perfect, or in a small degree sharper, some of<br/>the fifths. This seems to me the best principle for tempering our<br/>present scale.&quot; Moreover even late into the 19th century some tuners<br/>were still tuning meantone and calling the result equal. In fact,<br/>tuners called a lot of different things equal. All of this, of course,<br/>is just for keyboard instruments; orchestras or singers hardly needed<br/>to be bound to that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; While utonalities may become dubious in higher prime limits,<br/>&gt; &gt; they seem to work very well in the 5-limit (the minor triad)<br/>&gt; &gt; and the 7-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It depends what you mean by &apos;work very well&apos;.

I don&apos;t think a tendency to<br/>resolve in certain ways in a particular style can or should be used as<br/>a definition of consonance if you are planning to modify the word with<br/>adjectives like &quot;extreme&quot;.</p><p> I also know that F-A-B-D# is a French sixth, not a German,<br/>&gt; and is a more extreme dissonance, since it contains the augmented 4th<br/>&gt; above the root.</p><p>I was talking about the German sixth, not any other species, and<br/>calling the German sixth an extreme dissonance is simply absurd.<br/>Audibly, it is more consonant than the dominant seventh, and it&apos;s been<br/>a long time since people thought that was an extreme dissonance.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and in a meantone tuning it is impossible to hear C-E-G-A# as<br/>&gt; &gt; anything other than septimal.</p><p>&gt; How do I tell if I am hearing something as septimal or not?</p><p>*Listen* to it--it fuses into a single, smooth sounding chord, whereas<br/>with the dominant seventh you can hear the subdominant degree, the<br/>seventh of the chord, in splendid isolation from the rest of the<br/>chord, not really merging with it. In the 12-et and 31-et versions of<br/>Tristan you can hear that even for a utonal chord, there is much more<br/>fusion of tones and less blurriness and beating in the 31-et version.</p><p> I hear a<br/>&gt; dissonance, whereas if septimality were anything like 5-limit, I<br/>&gt; would hear a consonance.</p><p>When, exactly, do you hear a dissonance? Do you often listen to German<br/>sixths and the like in meantone?</p><p>&gt; &gt; The diminished triad is well-rooted in classical music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a chord with a considerable degree of dissonance.</p><p>Only by comparison with a triad. In modern terms, it hardly seems like<br/>a very dissonant chord, and even less so when in a meantone tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; in meantone its natural to interpret that as a &quot;magic&quot; 1-6/5-10/7<br/>&gt; chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why &apos;magic&apos;?</p><p>1-6/5 is a consonance, 1-10/7 is counted as a 7-limit consonance, and<br/>6/5-10/7, in any system of tuning which is tempering out 126/125, is<br/>the same as 1-6/5. While it isn&apos;t a chord with only just 7-limit<br/>consonances for intervals in the strict sense, it is in the sense of<br/>126/125 tempering, which means septimal meantone tempering. In<br/>meantone, the chord is adjusted to be more consonant and the system of<br/>harmony is such that its intervals can be considered to be septimal<br/>consonances.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Its enharmonic alteration to C-Eb-F# instead of C-Eb-Gb is even more<br/>&gt; &gt; clearly a septimal chord, and that is more true yet of C-D#-F#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now this becomes confusing. When one plays a meantone 5th, it is<br/>&gt; possible to tell that it is quite close to a pure consonance; with<br/>&gt; the enharmonically altered meantone diminished 6th, it is not<br/>&gt; possible and it sounds as a weird dissonance.</p><p>In 31 equal it is a pretty good 26/17, but however you slice it, it&apos;s<br/>the infamous wolf fifth.</p><p> Same with the meantone<br/>&gt; diminished 4th versus the major 3rd.</p><p>Not really. A diminished fourth can make an excellent 9/7 or 14/11,<br/>depending on the exact tuning of the meantone in question.</p><p>But you are saying that each of<br/>&gt; these enharmonically altered tritone chords corresponds quite closely<br/>&gt; to a just ratio in the 7-limit...</p><p>That&apos;s right. In meantone they are *all* closer to being consonant<br/>than 12-equal affords, but they are also all different. An augmented<br/>second is not a minor third, but in meantone both the augmented second<br/>and the minor third are more nearly consonant than the compromise<br/>interval which munges them both together in 12-et. An augmented fourth<br/>is not a diminished fifth, but both have moved to become closer to a<br/>septimal consonance.</p><p>so in this case the enharmonic<br/>&gt; alteration does not turn a consonance into a dissonance or vice<br/>&gt; versa. Does the 7-limit then erase the distinction between consonant<br/>&gt; and dissonant triads? How can I hear if my septimal chord is in tune?</p><p>How can you hear if a major triad is in tune?

(...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, we have several issues here. Is F-A-B-D# the utonal chord, or F-<br/>&gt; G#-B-D#, or both?</p><p>F-A-B-D# and F-G#-B-D# are different chords, so not both. F-A-B-D# is<br/>a meantone tempering of 1-5/4-7/5-7/4, and F-G#-B-D# of 1-7/6-7/5-7/4,<br/>the latter is a utonal tetrad, but not the former. The interval from<br/>5/4 to 7/5 is, tempered by meantone, a tone, as A-B should be. The<br/>result is &quot;magic&quot; in the 9-limit, especially if you put the A up an<br/>octave.</p><p>I don&apos;t mean that an aug 6th chord is weird or<br/>&gt; alien, even in 1/6 comma. (Perhaps I do find it alien in 1/4<br/>&gt; comma.) But I do claim that the chord F-B-D#-G# itself is, as a chord<br/>&gt; in A minor, no matter what the tuning, alien to common practice,<br/>&gt; since it superimposes the aug 4th pre-dominant function and the<br/>&gt; leading-note dominant function, resulting in a consonance (D#-G#)<br/>&gt; where a dissonance (D#-A) would be in a standard French 6th<br/>&gt; progression.</p><p>That, I suppose, depends on whether you think Wagner is alien to<br/>common practice or not, which in turn depends on how you define<br/>&quot;common practice&quot;. Certainly Wagner has been harmonically influential,<br/>and is often used as an example in theory books.</p><p>I also claim that the enharmonic reinterpretation of the<br/>&gt; chord as E#-G#-B-D# is crucial to its effect as a mild dissonance in<br/>&gt; the very remote key of D# minor, so any temperament that did not<br/>&gt; allow this rehearing would not be appropriate.</p><p>The few notes I tuned seemed very appropriate to Wagner&apos;s music, and<br/>clearly sounded better in 31 than in 12. How easily or successfully<br/>the experiment could be continued could only be answered by trying it.</p><p>&gt; The fundamental point here is that you seem to be writing of 7-limit<br/>&gt; chords as consonances whereas I hear them as various kinds of<br/>&gt; dissonance.

I hear a<br/>&gt;dissonance, whereas if septimality were anything like 5-limit, I<br/>&gt;would hear a consonance.</p><p>It&apos;s an acquired taste.  While orchestral intonation is far less<br/>accurate/consistent than the current thread implies, near-septimal<br/>chords do appear in the wild.  But they do not appear with any<br/>great degree of consistency.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Its enharmonic alteration to C-Eb-F# instead of C-Eb-Gb is even more<br/>&gt;&gt; clearly a septimal chord, and that is more true yet of C-D#-F#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now this becomes confusing. When one plays a meantone 5th, it is<br/>&gt;possible to tell that it is quite close to a pure consonance; with<br/>&gt;the enharmonically altered meantone diminished 6th, it is not<br/>&gt;possible and it sounds as a weird dissonance. Same with the meantone<br/>&gt;diminished 4th versus the major 3rd. But you are saying that each of<br/>&gt;these enharmonically altered tritone chords corresponds quite closely<br/>&gt;to a just ratio in the 7-limit, so in this case the enharmonic<br/>&gt;alteration does not turn a consonance into a dissonance or vice<br/>&gt;versa. Does the 7-limit then erase the distinction between consonant<br/>&gt;and dissonant triads?</p><p>Consonance/dissonance is, properly speaking, the domain of<br/>functional harmony, and only indirectly of psychoacoustics.</p><p>Concordance/discordance is the terminology suggested by Easley<br/>Blackwood for the pyschoacoustic part.  As such, many listeners<br/>report septimal chords of the kind Gene is talking about as<br/>concordant.  Many do not.  In the context of Barbershop music,<br/>I did, from the age of 5 or so.  In the context of acoustic piano<br/>music (Michael Harrison) when I first heard it at age 19, I<br/>did not.  In a few months, though, I recognized them as the<br/>same sound, and now I find them supremely consonant.</p><p>This kind of experience indicates (to me) the power of the new<br/>sounds of extended JI for a new music.

Johann Philipp Kirnberger spoke of differences in dissonance in 1776<br/>regarding the dominant 7th chord and its context.

At the time I was playing regularly in 31-tone tuning with<br/>Jon Catler&apos;s band.  In a very genuine manner he explained that he had only<br/>theorized about 31 ET but had never heard it.  My responses to him were at odds<br/>with his theorizing and I feel confident he looked further into the matter.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2005 11:37:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Awesome!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When did it change from Musica to Muzika?</p><p>yesterday.<br/>:)</p><p>we got a trademark on Muzika ... i still like<br/>the old spelling, but that&apos;s how it goes ...</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2005 11:40:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; i think it was not possible for anyone to<br/>&gt; &gt; notice a contextual meaning for &quot;dissonance&quot; until the<br/>&gt; &gt; variability of musical styles was consciously discerned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you sure about that, monz?</p><p>no ... that&apos;s why i wrote &quot;i think ...&quot;. ;-)</p><p>i&apos;d have to do some research to make a confident statement<br/>about this, and as you all know, i have absolutely no time<br/>for research right now.</p><p>but based on the absurd amount of research i&apos;ve already<br/>done in this field, i think there&apos;s at least some weight<br/>to what i wrote.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2005 2:18:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Congratulations Monz!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>i say we just combine the math and music and forget about<br/>any dichotomy. i&apos;m happy to report that i&apos;m just home from<br/>the first public presentation of Tonalsoft Muzika microtonal<br/>music software.  it took place at the Sonic Arts Gallery on<br/>Friday evening, April 29, as part of the South Park &quot;Walkabout&quot;,<br/>a neighborhood event which occurs about 3 times a year.</p><p>i did 7 demonstrations of Muzika, as various groups of<br/>interested people wandered in, and Jonathan, Brink and i<br/>did some jam sessions, with them playing keyboards and me<br/>playing (&quot;noodling&quot; with the mouse) the Muzika lattice,<br/>using it as an instrument.</p><p>the full commercial release of the software is still scheduled<br/>for summer 2005.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2005 3:30:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Muzika???
