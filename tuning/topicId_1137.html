Many have been struck by these<br/>effects; Herman Miller just posted to the effect that</p><p>&gt;On the other hand, I&apos;ve also tried retuning instrument samples using<br/>the<br/>&gt;methods described in Sethares&apos; book. Timbres specifically tweaked for<br/>&gt;15-tet do sound better in 15-tet than harmonic timbres, and they sound<br/>bad<br/>&gt;in combination with harmonic timbres in the same tuning. One of my<br/>recent<br/>&gt;experiments (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/yeequitch-keesha.ra">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/yeequitch-keesha.ra</a>) uses<br/>&gt;these new 15-tet timbres.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is an extent to which Sethares fails to account for<br/>consonance and dissonance; this has to do with our periodicity detection<br/>mechanisms, and would cause us to judge a set of metallophones tuned<br/>with their fundamentals forming a &quot;harmonic series&quot; consonant, and in<br/>general explains why we prefer otonalities to utonalities -- a fact<br/>Sethares&apos;s theories can&apos;t explain.</p><p>Bill, have you used 7-limit or higher utonalities? With harmonic<br/>timbres, inharmonic ones, or both? What do you think of them?</p></div>
