You don&apos;t hear painters complain about<br/>having too many colors ! Unfortunately the musical establishment seems<br/>content with the grade school box of 12 crayons.</p><p>And, adding to this is the astonishing amount of misinformation in<br/>circulation. I suppose we primarily have to thank all the moron members of<br/>the &quot;classical&quot; music establishment for the sorry state of affairs. All that<br/>rot about well temperament being 12EDO, etc., etc.</p><p>Anyway, in particular :</p><p>&quot;The following is a reprint of THE GUILD OF AMERICAN LUTHIERS data sheet<br/>#45.&quot;<br/><a href="http://w3.ime.net/~cygnus/equal_temperament.html">http://w3.ime.net/~cygnus/equal_temperament.html</a></p><p>This article seems to tell guitarists that they should learn to accept 12EDO<br/>as the absolute truth &amp; not even try anything else. It should have included<br/>info that alternatives do exist and are in widespread use. Instead :</p><p>1) &quot; (They might be interested to know that to approximate pure chords on<br/>   all forms would require about three dozen frets within the octave.) &quot;</p><p>  As is commonly encountered, here again we see the implication that 36EDO<br/>  is unacceptable/unusable/impractical. We all know this is b.s.</p><p>2) &quot; Guitarists who have been trying to tune to one or another pure chord<br/>     form must learn to understand and accept equal temperament. &quot;</p><p>  Understand ? yes ! accept ? no ! But it gets worse :</p><p>3) &quot; The system of equal temperament reduces the number to twelve, thereby<br/>   making manageable all instruments of fixed pitch. &quot;</p><p>  They&apos;re telling all those unsuspecting musicians that equal temperament<br/>  means only 12EDO. They should make room for a dictionary in their budget.</p><p>4) Worst of all, they advocate that we not bother trying anything else, and<br/>   imply that to do so is a waste of time and effort &amp; is *wrong* :</p><p>  &quot; If you are one of those persons who is sensitive to pure intervals, here<br/>    is what you are going to notice on an absolutely perfectly tuned guitar<br/>    in equal temperament: Play an open E major chord. Listen to G# on the<br/>    third string and you most likely will want to lower it very slightly.<br/>    Don&apos;t do it. Ignore it. Enjoy the overall beauty and resonance of chord<br/>    just as does the pianist. &quot;</p><p>   Which means they also don&apos;t know all pianos are not tuned to 12EDO !</p><p>   &quot;Learn to expect and accept the slight sharpness of the major third in<br/>    each chord (and oppositely, the flatness of the minor third in each<br/>    minor chord). Train your ear to accept tempered intervals and you will<br/>    be much happier with your guitar. &quot;</p><p>   The last word :</p><p>   &quot;When the foregoing steps are followed correctly, the strings will be<br/>   tuned perfectly to equal temperament. No further tuning adjustments are<br/>   permissible.&quot;</p><p>-----------</p><p>This is only half a useful article, raising important points about tuing<br/>using harmonics, etc. It is important to educate performers of fixed pitch<br/>instruments about the design &amp; tuning of their instrument, guitarists in<br/>particular are a *high risk* ;-) group.</p><p>Speaking of which, anyone else here dissapointed with Steve Vai&apos;s &quot;The Ultra<br/>Zone&quot; ? I&apos;m stunned by how unstunned I am.</p><p>Perhaps someone can write to the Guild of American Luthiers &amp; see what<br/>happens. Could be amusing at the very least.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>BTW, Britannica&apos;s explanation of JI is flawed, or rather, incomplete.<br/>Search for &quot;just intonation&quot; at <a href="http://www.britannica.com">http://www.britannica.com</a> and take a peek.</p><p>- Drew</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
