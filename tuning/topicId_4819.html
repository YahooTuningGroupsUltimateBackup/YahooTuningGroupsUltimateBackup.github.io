I came<br/>into microtonality with a few thoughts; it would be<br/>nice if chords were more in tune (major thirds in<br/>particular); it would be nice if higher partials were<br/>better represented (7 especially, 11 somewhat and<br/>13 maybe, beyond that I&apos;m not sure there are distinct<br/>entities from the nearby intervals that they&apos;ll pun<br/>with).</p><p>However, having the harmonies more in tune is NOT in<br/>itself a theory of harmony. A LOT of what transpires<br/>on this list is rediscovery of the fundamental<br/>contradiction between JI and the music that has grown<br/>in the Western tradition over the past few hundred<br/>years.</p><p>After banging my head on that for awhile, (and better<br/>heads than mine have banged harder), I realized [again]<br/>that I can&apos;t develop something from &apos;harmony&apos;, that<br/>it all grows out of the melody. (I say again, because<br/>Western music is the only place where a codification<br/>of harmony irregardless of melody has taken place, and<br/>there should be no surprise that it may well be that<br/>going back to melody, and the incidental harmonies<br/>created by simultaneous melodies, maybe a &apos;natural&apos;<br/>path for moving forward.</p><p>Obviously this idea is supported by many sorts of &apos;world<br/>music&apos; and going back to contrapuntal writing before<br/>the Baroque era (I believe) when the codification of<br/>harmony really was solidified. (tonic dominant dominant<br/>tonic subdominant tonic dominant tonic).</p><p>I should thank Margo in particular for her posts here<br/>and her writings on the ancient systems of polyphony,<br/>since that really cemented in my mind the idea of<br/>polyphony without codified harmony (which in 5-limit,<br/>one should be able to get from a traditional counterpoint<br/>book, but seeing it in 3-limit made me realize, &quot;there<br/>is a similar approach in 7-limit, 9-limit etc&quot; and<br/>the &apos;harmony rules&apos; at that limit will flow out of melody<br/>and simultaneous melody as they always do.</p><p>   <a href="http://www.medieval.org">http://www.medieval.org</a></p><p>features Margo&apos;s writings and a lot of other good<br/>information.</p><p>In investigating melody and simultaneous melody, it is<br/>sufficient (and proper) to do it in the subset of a<br/>temperment that may be described as &quot;modal&quot;, which<br/>again, makes sense since it can evolve the rules of<br/>tonality in the new tuning. 12 tones should be able<br/>to contain a particular &apos;scale&apos; and its &apos;rotations&apos;<br/>that may be used in a new tuning.</p><p>Lastly, why 12-out-of-N from an ET scale, rather than<br/>12 JI pitches. Ultimately, I am most interested in a few<br/>ETs, 31 and 53 especially, since they do exactly what I<br/>originally wanted; tune the major thirds and extend the<br/>pallette with higher partials.</p><p>There is certainly a limitation to 12-out-of-N,<br/>since it is really just chipping off a portion<br/>of the lattice, and the interesting &apos;tonal rules&apos;<br/>in a new tuning (where the puns are), may be broken<br/>in a misleading way.</p><p>But its a start.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=4826 href="#4826">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
