However the SY99 also has a slot for a RAM data card that<br/>will allow you two additional custom tunings.  The only constraint is<br/>that user-defined (&quot;internal memory&quot;) voices can&apos;t use card tunings<br/>and card voices can&apos;t use internal memory tunings  Unfortunately it&apos;s<br/>nearly impossible to get your hands on one of those data cards, I&apos;d<br/>like to have one myself.</p><p>--Ken Wauchope</p></div>
