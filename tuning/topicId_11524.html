Actually, even the 24 tET neutral third of 350<br/>&gt;cents sounds too sharp to me.  :-)</p><p>Christopher, I was thinking of a 335-cent neutral third between root and<br/>third, and a 367-cent neutral third between third and fifth. Clearly, the<br/>larger you make one, the smaller you make the other!</p></div>
