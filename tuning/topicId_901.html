My charts at<br/>&gt;<a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/OpenTunings.htm">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/OpenTunings.htm</a> answer this for many<br/>&gt;important cases.</p><p>Thanks, Dave Keenan, for your work on this thread.  Dan&apos;s formula is very<br/>interesting, and your charts are very handy.  I had never noticed how<br/>viable 37tET was a 7-limit...</p><p>You and Dan are both prime candidates for Scala.  It will approximate any<br/>scale with ratios, and you can restrict the ratios it returns by prime<br/>limit and/or a number of other weighting schemes.  Scala will also find ET<br/>approximations to rational scales to an arbitrary degree of accuracy.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
