We don&apos;t hear his imperfections.).<br/>&gt; Haydn is seamless in Werckmeister III.</p><p>Sir, whatever you choose to set up and prefer on a modern Steinway is your business, not Mozart&apos;s or Haydn&apos;s.  They didn&apos;t have anything resembling your modern piano.  And, you&apos;d need to produce some evidence that they ever heard of or used Werckmeister (a nearly 100-year-old temperament at the time, a speculative organ-conversion temperament found in a book!) on *any* of their struck-string or plucked-string instruments.</p><p>And I say this having just performed, last Sunday morning, a movement of Haydn&apos;s sonata 18 in E-flat major, the F# minor (but wildly modulatory) slow movement of Schubert 959, and Strauss&apos;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Waltz (the piano arrangement in the Dover edition) for our church service.  That was all on a Yamaha piano, tuned by me in the Bach/Lehman, which as you know is based on a series of 1/6 comma naturals.  It worked great (IMO) through all those keys and shifting moods just because the temperament is so versatile in that way.  But, I wouldn&apos;t make any claims that Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Strauss, or anyone else connected with Vienna ever necessarily used it.  Certainly not on a Yamaha.  All I know, inferentially, is that those composers had some system(s) that were circulating enough that they and their customers could play this music, and presumably enjoy it.  [And we also have the clue that Mozart and his father taught and used 1/6 comma systems as a basis of their musicianship, on the proper inflection of semitones; I refer you to Dr Duffin&apos;s fine book.]  I keep our church&apos;s piano in this all the time, and it&apos;s used by all kinds of other players there too, for any repertoire.  I go in and practice Chopin, Grieg, and Brahms on it for my own enjoyment, as my keyboards at home are all non-pianos.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to offer one more &quot;strident reaction&quot; about W-III, to stay in character.  I&apos;ve played through at least a hundred pages of Mozart and Haydn sonata movements, in W-III, on my harpsichord...and IMO it sounds like *%#*&amp;%#.  It can&apos;t handle even the common chords found in E minor music, or any higher number of sharps in minor, or E-flat major music, or more flats, or C or F minors.  Those Pythagorean triads on B, F#, Db, and Ab are simply too strident *on harpsichord*, IMO.  The apparent observation that you (Johnny) like them on modern piano in that music is, once again, your business.  I&apos;m not even sure I know what the phrases &quot;Haydn is seamless in Werckmeister III&quot; or &quot;unbelievably secure&quot; mean to you.</p><p>Anyway, party on.  The important thing is to play the music, isn&apos;t it? Haydn&apos;s piano sonatas, and Mozart&apos;s, and CPE Bach&apos;s, are great stuff to read straight through on harpsichord and clavichord...which is what I do for fun.  I have given W-III a fair play in this, and I personally don&apos;t see any way those composers would have tolerated something that lumpy and ugly, at least on harpsichord.  Nor do I give my son any haircut with four straight snips of a scissors, which is analogous to W-III&apos;s behavior, because it would be a tastelessly bad and amateurish haircut.   (And this haircut thing isn&apos;t even my own illustration; it&apos;s from Dominique Devie&apos;s book about historical temperaments.)  Your mileage may vary.</p><p>I even have some examples of myself playing in W-III on harpsichord here:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob_p8vBNZW8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob_p8vBNZW8</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziJE_tXS9Ac">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziJE_tXS9Ac</a><br/>(Well, part of the point there is to demonstrate directly that W-III doesn&apos;t work very felicitously for continuo parts in Bach vocal music....)</p><p>Frankly, it&apos;s difficult anymore for me to play W-III&apos;s F# major and C# major triads in their functions within ordinary music, without cringing.   Or, the rattly A-flat major triad.  I understand that some people do enjoy and prefer that temperament anyway, for the contrasts it brings into the music (or for whatever reason), but I don&apos;t see how a Mozart or either of the big famous Haydns would have deliberately chosen such a thing, given other options.  If they were inclined to stick any published organ temperament onto a stringed instrument (and why should they?), why should they pick W-III over, say, Sorge&apos;s 1758 temperament or any of the best of Neidhardt&apos;s?</p><p>Cheerio,<br/>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2008 9:24:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt; Mozart is unbelievably secure in Werckmeister III (quite foreign<br/>&gt;  &gt; a description than one would gather by only reading Brad&apos;s<br/>&gt;  &gt; strident reactions.

I&apos;m sorry, but your diagnosis is not very helpful.</p><p>&gt;     To place undue reverence on &quot;precise tunings&quot;, which were poorly<br/>&gt;     documented and of doubtful providence, seems to me to be a bit of a<br/>&gt;     fools&apos; quest which requires gallons of gullibility.</p><p>As my web site and papers explain, my analysis arises foremost from Bach&apos;s extant MUSIC: most notably, the use of 13, 14, 15, etc differently spelled notes within the same composition, and not only 12.   Some of the most remarkable examples are in the book of inventions/sinfonias, and of course in WTC (1).  That enharmonic usage, itself, constrains any inferences about Bach&apos;s tuning method(s) to fall within a narrow range of possibilities.  THEN: the evidence of the title-page drawing on the WTC, upon that ground, narrows it further.</p><p>Anybody who thinks my methods are otherwise has it backwards, themselves, as a misunderstanding of my work.</p><p>&gt;     Claiming you have found a Bach<br/>&gt;     code in ornamental squiggles is one of the great scams in music.<br/>&gt;     Truly, your responses were right on cue. The greater shame is with<br/>&gt;     Early Music and its publisher, Oxford Music Press.</p><p>But, I haven&apos;t claimed &quot;a Bach code&quot;!  And my &quot;responses were right on cue&quot; in what way -- are you referring to &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; fads?</p><p>If you&apos;ve actually read my web site, closely, you&apos;d already know that all of my research grows from a doctoral project of mine 1993-4, where I investigated both the music and the historical possibilities of modified-meantone tempering for this repertoire.  That&apos;s my background on this.</p><p>If some people choose to mistake all this for a &quot;scam&quot;, thereby severely misunderstanding my work, well, that&apos;s their loss; I am quite earnest about this work, and my main body of evidence is all that Bach music (some instrumental, some vocal) that uses extended enharmonic notes.</p><p>I don&apos;t take Bach&apos;s drawing as any kind of &quot;code&quot;.  (What a convenient straw-man assignment that is, to rubbish the work!)  I take the drawing as a practical diagram for adjustment of harpsichord tuning pins, a hands-on process, nudging the notes slightly off the sound of pure 5ths by single or double amounts.</p><p>&gt;     [Johnny] You are a generalist. For me it is the long trail following a<br/>&gt;     masters thesis. It is painful to hear Mozart in ET when it is so<br/>&gt;     expressive, with<br/>&gt;     deeper dimensions of meaning provided by ANY unequal temperament.<br/>&gt;     Brad has<br/>&gt;     capitalized on this phenomenon. Only his is a modern device. I have<br/>&gt;     invented nothing. Neil, please keep your students safe.</p><p>Johnny, agreed, you haven&apos;t invented Werckmeister III.  However, you&apos;ve followed a bunch of 20th century musicians who took that organ-conversion temperament and applied it far out of context, putting it onto stringed instruments.  THAT process is a modern phenomenon.  For your hypothesis to hold up, we need some evidence that any 18th century musicians not only put W-III onto stringed keyboards, but that they (in some way) *preferred* it over other practical options available to them.</p><p>&gt;     Tom: They both trust their own ears above any historical<br/>&gt;     documentation, as<br/>&gt;     far as present-day performance is concerned. Which is just as well for<br/>&gt;     them, because the historical record is extremely incomplete and<br/>&gt;     inconclusive.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Johnny: If you see no difference between us, that certainly says a<br/>&gt;     lot to<br/>&gt;     me. While musicologists mistrust their ears so completely, and distrust<br/>&gt;     musicians accordingly, there is indeed room for concert work. Sorry<br/>&gt;     you don&apos;t<br/>&gt;     feel that way.</p><p>Here I agree with both Tom and Johnny, in part.  The historical record *is* extremely incomplete and inconclusive; but I don&apos;t (and I won&apos;t speak for Johnny!) trust my own ears ABOVE hard evidence.  The hard evidence is Bach&apos;s music, plus every available clue to tuning practices around him and his students.  And I continue to work on those.  And being a musician myself, I *do* trust the ears of musical experts, including my own, on the plausibility of any offered solutions.  That&apos;s why (sorry, Johnny!) I personally can&apos;t accept the idea of W-III being as widespread as Johnny asserts: it just doesn&apos;t sound plausible to me in the way it mis-handles all those enharmonic events.  The way to test these things is indeed to try out as much of the music as possible...but it also has to be on instruments like those the composers knew, not only modern pianos and such.</p><p>&gt;     Tom: They both think that what they choose to perform with, and<br/>&gt;     sounds good<br/>&gt;     to them, now, is thereby validated or &apos;proved&apos; or &apos;tested&apos; as an<br/>&gt;     actual historical tuning, that what they hear now has some sort of<br/>&gt;     backwards-in-time influence on what Bach or Mozart or Haydn did 250 or<br/>&gt;     300 years ago. That&apos;s the utter insanity of it.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Johnny: Insanity is to put words in my mouth. Brad&apos;s views are<br/>&gt;     public. I concur that Tom is out of line here.  It&apos;s &quot;insanity&quot; (Tom&apos;s own assessment!) to put words into either Johnny&apos;s or my mouths on this, on any methods of validation.</p><p>&gt;     Tom: They both seem to think that it&apos;s not at all important whether you<br/>&gt;     make reasonable or unreasonable claims about what famous composers<br/>&gt;     actually did in history - as long as you are happy playing music now<br/>&gt;     in the present.</p><p>Tom, since you&apos;re willing to put stock in what I &quot;seem to think&quot; (which &quot;seeming&quot; is way off base), what&apos;s happened to your own scientific methodology?  You&apos;re not representing what I actually *do* think about all these things.  I, personally, am interested in promoting only *reasonable* claims.  That is why I work hard on checking them closely, through many rounds of sifting, before presenting them.</p><p>Enough for now.
