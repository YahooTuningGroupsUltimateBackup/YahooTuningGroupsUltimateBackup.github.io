If it&apos;s graphically feasible to also include the<br/>dyads and monads, do so . . . I&apos;ll make 150 sound files (eventually . . .).</p><p>Right, in that case I&apos;ll do you both.</p><p>Without diads:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany_template.txt">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany_template.txt</a><br/>With diads:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany_with_diads_template.txt">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany_with_diads_template.txt</a><br/>(I&apos;ve called them text files since they are not valid VRML until you do the S&amp;R)</p><p>N.B. just realised it is de_k_any, so renamed everything accord.</p><p>&gt;Hey, how about using little spheres for the monads, little cylinders for the<br/>diads, and little prisms for the triads (and in the 3)5, little tetrahedra<br/>for the tetrads)? Should make using and understanding this a whole lot<br/>easier.</p><p>Interesting idea.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;ll do tetrahedra for the 3)5, - nice thing about those is that<br/>because of the high degree of symmetry one won&apos;t need to do much<br/>figuring out to decide the orientation for them.</p><p>The cylinders and prisms are more tricky (assuming you want them to<br/>line up nicely and symmetrically).</p><p>If one uses the most obvious kind of approach, you have to figure out the<br/>directions of the axes of the cylinders / prisms as 3D vectors<br/>for each one, and then having done that, need to figure out what 3D axis to<br/>rotate about, and by how much, to get to that direction from the VRML default<br/>of  vertically upwards - (though luckily I have little app. I did that works out the<br/>second half of this calc. automatically)<br/>= 30 3D rotations to figure out to do the cylinders, and another 30 for the prisms.</p><p>- I think I&apos;ll pass on that for now, but think it over and see if there is any<br/>easier way to do it.</p><p>Good thing about this is that once you&apos;ve done the audio clips, one can<br/>put as many VRML files using them as one likes in the same directory.</p><p>E.g. one could have a whole range for varying xx, so varying perspective views.</p><p>Here is the console app for making the VRML from the template:</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.exe">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.exe</a></p><p>It&apos;s for Win 95/98.</p><p>c-code:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.c">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.c</a></p><p>Run it in same directory as the decany_template.wrl</p><p>Ex. of use:<br/>SRVRML 0.3 r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 r9</p><p>will make the xx=0.3 file. (replace the ri by whatever you<br/>want for the vertices)</p><p>Will save it as<br/>decany_0p3_r0_r1_r2_r3_r4_r5_r6_r7_r8_r9.wrl</p><p>where the r0, r1 etc will be whatever text you choose for the<br/>vertices, with * replaced by s, / by o, and . by p (to make<br/>them suitable for file names)</p><p>I&apos;ve tried xx = 0.25 and at that setting you just see the yellow spheres,<br/>through the other side, but not the diads - would be good one to use for<br/>the model without diads.</p><p>Run without any args for more detail of options to use.</p><p>Look near head of file for list of all the midi clips to make.</p><p>Since you are planning to make .wav clips, you can do<br/>a S&amp;R of the template to replace .mid by .wav, which is safe to do, won&apos;t<br/>affect anything else in the VRML.</p><p>More later - the 3)5 template still to come,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=15509 href="#15509">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
