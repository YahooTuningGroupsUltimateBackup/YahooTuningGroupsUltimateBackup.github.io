My wife reads a silly story that sort of makes fun of the poem, by the same author--he&apos;s making fun of himself.  He&apos;s a guy who lives somewhere in Canada with the handle &apos;Blobru&apos;.  Blobru got a real laugh out of it.  It&apos;s enough for me if a few people get some pleasure out of my stuff.</p><p>It&apos;s not really microtonal, but my head would have exploded if I added that challenge to the difficulty of learning Logic Pro 8 for my first piece.</p><p>There *is* another way to do microtunings with more than 12 notes per octave in Logic:  One can build &apos;exs&apos; sampler instruments with a tuning specified for each key, assigning the same sample individually to each of every key on the keyboard.   That&apos;s a LOT of work, and tedious, but once the exs instruments were built, you could use them on many pieces.</p><p>Otherwise, one seems to be stuck with a fixed 12-note microtuning  that can&apos;t change over time, or &apos;hermode&apos; tuning, where the computer tries to make sense of what you&apos;re doing--meh.</p><p>Another workaround in Logic is to use plug-in instruments like PianoTeq--I may purchase some synth plug-ins for this purpose.  Or,  bend the pitches individually.</p><p>I wish Logic Pro 8 let you specify Scala files--multiple ones--as many as needed as your tunings change over time.  As in:  measure 5, beat 3:  &apos;76 notes per octave&apos;...measure 9, beat 1:  &apos;36 note Just&apos;, etc., where each of these names are Scala files that define the tunings.</p><p>Logic Pro 8 is powerful and packed with features, but I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve enjoyed learning it--there are many, many little things that seem annoying, and many things that I have yet to learn, where the explanation is buried somewhere in the huge manual.</p><p>If I&apos;m wrong about Logic Pro 8 microtuning capability, I&apos;d appreciate it if someone would let me know--it might make a huge difference in future pieces.   I *don&apos;t* think bouncing down your tracks in one tuning and importing the audio to a new sequence is an acceptable workaround--too cumbersome and confining.</p><p>When the noise from cars and construction quiets down in the American city at 2 am, you hear the 60 cycle hum of the power grid everywhere--I think Lamonte Young commented on this a long time ago.</p><p>Caleb</p><p>On Jun 6, 2010, at 7:39 AM, Kalle Aho wrote:</p><p>&gt; Caleb,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like this a lot, very well-produced sound.
