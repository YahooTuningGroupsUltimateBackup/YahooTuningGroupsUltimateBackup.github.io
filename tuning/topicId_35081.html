This is an issue of musicianship.</p><p>Navigating 72 dieses of 16.666666666etc. cents is more abstract than turning<br/>12 into 1200.  The non-math-priority mind (like mine).

Quartertones are big in microtonal music, particularly in size.<br/> Shaving it down into half and quarters is no harder than shading by 14 cents<br/>for an accurate 386 cent JI major third.  The actual training musicians have<br/>had with the Korg tuners demonstrate that one can read a dial graded by 5<br/>cent indications.  Finding the middle is easy.

The non-math-priority mind (like mine).</p><p>***72 is *really* easy, Johnny!  There is no math involved in it<br/>whatsoever!  It *does* mean, however, and in this you are more than<br/>correct, that the microtonal universe is limited to the 72-tET system.</p><p>However, that system contains, *all* our &quot;regular* 12-tET notes,<br/>*all* our quartertones, and the player only has to learn *two*<br/>different smaller intervals than that!</p><p>They just learn a 33 cent deviation and a 17 cent deviation from any<br/>given pitch!  That&apos;s a *very* limited universe that people can<br/>PRACTICE.</p><p>I say that *that&apos;s* where the musicianship lies, in *practicing.*</p><p>PRACTICING 1200 per octave is just too much!  Where do you start?<br/>What intervals do you have them practice?  You can&apos;t do everything at<br/>once!</p><p>My pieces now come with a CD so that the player can PRACTICE the<br/>deviations of 33 cents and 17 cents from the 12-tET notes.  That&apos;s<br/>all they have to do.</p><p>Where&apos;s the math in that?  It&apos;s totally *real* musicianship, real<br/>playing.  It would take *years* to develop the same ability<br/>throughout the entire 1200 spectrum.  I wouldn&apos;t even know where to<br/>start.</p><p>I suppose you would have to start like this:</p><p>0 cent to 5 cents</p><p>0 cent to 10 cents</p><p>0 cent to 15 cents</p><p>0 cent to 20 cents</p><p>0 cent to 25 cents</p><p>Then, you wouldn&apos;t have to go past 25 from any given quartertone.<br/>And even *that* isn&apos;t enough, since you&apos;re saying they should be able<br/>to hit *every* cent.  I&apos;m exhausted, already, thinking about it!</p><p>Frankly, that also is the &quot;problem&quot; with the incipient microtonal<br/>composer.  We don&apos;t know where to start after quarter tones.  At<br/>least, I will speak for my humble self.</p><p>When I started working with microtonality seriously, about one or two<br/>years ago... well, I&apos;d done pieces for years before, as you know, but<br/>not as intensively, the only thing I could think to do were quarter-<br/>tones.</p><p>What else would I do?  I didn&apos;t know.  I imagined the most reasonable<br/>thing to do in an alternate tuning was to try to do *pure*<br/>intervals.  This wasn&apos;t just my *own* idea, some other people also<br/>came up with it... :)</p><p>In any case, given this fact, I needed a *known universe* as a<br/>composer to work with.  Working with 72 does, indeed, limit my<br/>options, but they are the &quot;near just intonation&quot; options that I have<br/>been looking for to offset 12-tET and 24-tET and with 72-tET you can<br/>do *both* of these things at the same time, in a *very* easy and<br/>systematic way!</p><p> When Partch comes in ratios, my violist writes it out in cents (not<br/>72).</p><p>***You should talk to Ted Mook, then, about this, since he *swears*<br/>by the 72-tET notation for easy performance of Partch.  And he&apos;s<br/>done, apparently *lots* of it, with several recordings out.  Several<br/>examples of his work with Partch in the 72-tET notation are shown<br/>here:</p><p><a href="http://www.webcom.com/~tmook/lipo.html">http://www.webcom.com/~tmook/lipo.html</a></p><p>When my perfect pitch player has to play music, 16.666 cents is too<br/>vague for playing any exact note.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****I guess what you&apos;re saying here is that your players are taught<br/>to play finer divisions than 17 cents.  Well, that&apos;s great but,<br/>frankly, I have some trouble hearing some of these smaller intervals<br/>myself, sometimes (I confess) and wouldn&apos;t like to try to teach<br/>musicians *new* to microtonality smaller intervals that I, myself, am<br/>comfortable with.</p><p>I guess I&apos;m a little &quot;gross...&quot; but 17 is plenty small enough for me,<br/>thank you....

I&apos;m finding out<br/>more about this every day!</p><p>&gt; As to covering JI intervals, 23 x 16.666 = 383.318.  That sucks as<br/>a just major third.  The JI composers would never accept that<br/>interval as a JI major third.</p><p>***Well, I don&apos;t know.  Kraig Grady even seems to accept 72-tET and<br/>he&apos;s a kind of &quot;litmus test&quot; as it were.  That&apos;s the only ET he&apos;ll<br/>even CONSIDER.  And, yes, I admit, the thirds are 3 cents off.  That<br/>subtle distinction is, most probably lost on *me* personally,<br/>regrettably.</p><p>Besides, it is the 12-tET major third that is best represented.<br/>&gt; There is no real JI 383 cent interval.  I have had personal<br/>experience retraining a 72-trained musician with difficulty for this<br/>reason, who now composes in Werckmeister III (which would be a total<br/>waste in 72).</p><p>***Yes, it is true that many of the temperaments are not well<br/>represented by 72-tET.  But most of them aren&apos;t notated in CENTS.<br/>They just retune the harpsichord and that&apos;s it!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, I&apos;m not a musician, but dividing 12 into 1200 is mentally very<br/>&gt; comfortable.</p><p>****I wouldn&apos;t sell yourself short, Johnny!  You are a very *fine*<br/>musician!</p><p>You meant, of course, *mathematician...*  Well, I can&apos;t see where all<br/>the math is, frankly.  All I can see is the routine practicing of 33<br/>cents 17 cents deviations over and over and over again, just like we<br/>have to practice ANYTHING to get it right.  EVENTUALLY, it *will* be<br/>accurate.  But to practice the full spectrum?  Or to practice up to<br/>25 cents (or 50?) away from a quartertone??</p><p>What kind of exercises for musicians *are* there for this<br/>practicing?  Do *you* have them?  Are they available in the way that<br/>the Maneri ear training exercises are available for musicians to<br/>practice??</p><p>I&apos;ve never seen such exercises.  If we *train* people, we need<br/>exercises, so it seems to *me!*</p><p>I&apos;m not *doubting* this is possible, I&apos;ve just *never* seen the 1200<br/>ear training procedures as of yet.  Maybe they are around.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if I can buy the thought that such practicing can come<br/>in play by just playing *pieces!*  There&apos;s not enough reiteration of<br/>the same *intervals* in playing pieces.</p><p>It&apos;s like using Czerny to gain piano finger dexterity.  Not great<br/>music, not too much fun, but it develops the *technique!*</p><p>Quartertones are big in microtonal music, particularly in size.<br/>&gt;  Shaving it down into half and quarters is no harder than shading<br/>by 14 cents for an accurate 386 cent JI major third.</p><p>***I think for many players it would be hard to shade down by exactly<br/>14 cents.  Why more than 17?  Well, simply because the player has<br/>been playing so *many* 17 deviations.  Unless there is more such<br/>training for 14 shadings, I&apos;m not sure I can buy that...</p><p>The actual training musicians have<br/>&gt; had with the Korg tuners demonstrate that one can read a dial<br/>graded by 5 cent indications.

It is now international.  72<br/>is favored in Boston and Salzburg, Austria.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I guess here you&apos;re saying that 72-tET is favored in only two<br/>locations.</p><p>Say, I didn&apos;t know it was being used in Salzburg, Austria!  :)</p><p>Thanks for the tip.  See, you know more about 72 than *I* do, as I<br/>surmised!</p><p>&gt; Please understand, I am excited for the activity in Boston, know<br/>well both Ezra and Joe, and realize that some (like soprano Meredith<br/>Borden) can proceed naturally to a JI world of intervals.  But I bet<br/>they never go back.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***You mean once we&apos;ve gone into Just there is no turning back?<br/>That&apos;s *scary* Johnny.  It&apos;s a little like the &quot;Night of the Living<br/>Dead...&quot;</p><p>I appreciate this exchange and, although 72 has turned out to be<br/>*extremely* beneficial for me PERSONALLY in my composing, I will<br/>continue to offer the extra service of putting cents deviations above<br/>all my notes, as necessary!</p><p>Then it&apos;s in the beloved *cents notation* as well!!!</p><p>best, and thanks again!</p><p>jp</p></div>
