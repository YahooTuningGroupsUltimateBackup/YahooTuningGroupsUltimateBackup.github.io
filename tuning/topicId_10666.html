The harmonium follows<br/>you&quot;.  Now, English is not his native language, so I guess that statement<br/>could be interpreted various ways.  Mine is that its ok to use the harmonium<br/>if you are a beginning vocal student (such as myself) and trying to get a<br/>rough handle on the raags, but don&apos;t use it as a crutch. He also advised that<br/>it is preferable to practice with a drone instrument such as a tambura (or an<br/>&quot;electric tambura&quot; box like the one he brings to class) rather than with a<br/>harmonium.</p><p>When I saw P. Jasraj in concert with Suman and others, there was a harmonium<br/>player involved.  He did not provide the drone (there were four tambura<br/>players onstage already), but instead played raags himself on his harmonium,<br/>thus functioning as just another &quot;voice&quot; on stage.  P. Jasraj occasionally<br/>also accompanied his vocals with his own harp-like instrument, but he always<br/>tuned it between raags.  He did not appear to use the harmonium to guide his<br/>tuning - I think he was using the drone boxes then tuning the other strings to<br/>the desired raag on that base drone note.</p><p>Next time I see Suman-ji, I will ask him if harmonium players &quot;tune&quot; their<br/>harmoniums for concerts.  If not, I suspect the way the pitch ornamentations<br/>of the vocalists are reconciled with harmoniums (if a player is present) is<br/>very similar to the way a blues harmonica player would play with a pianist.<br/>I&apos;ll try to ask him about this too.   But keep him mind that while he is very<br/>intelligent and his English quite good, he is not likely to understand me if I<br/>use the words &quot;7-limit just intonation&quot; and the like; I&apos;m trying to learn<br/>these concepts myself!</p><p>Paolo</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Rick McGowan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rmcgowan@apple.com">rmcgowan@apple.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, June 15, 2000 6:00 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Variability of intervals in Indian music (and related<br/>topics)</p><p>&gt; One thing that continues to boggle my mind in this whole arena is how on<br/>earth these Hindustani vocalists reconcile the subtleties of the vocal<br/>intonation with the (presumably) 12-tone equal-tempered harmonium that enjoys<br/>such widespread use...
