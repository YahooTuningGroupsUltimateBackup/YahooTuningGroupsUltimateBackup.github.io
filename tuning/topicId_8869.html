Many of us on this list write music, and the<br/>use of tuning systems and ratios *at the service* of an endproduct musical<br/>goal is paramount.  Therefore, I believe that such discussions are fully in<br/>the realm of tuning.  In fact, personally I believe they are the *most*<br/>important discussions in the realm of tuning, perhaps *EVEN SURPASSING* the<br/>exact numerical ratio of the phenomenal &quot;high third.&quot;</p><p>Keith Grady.  TD 548:20<br/>&gt;&quot;What atonality did was end modulation (transposition being something<br/>different) or at least postpone &gt;it. The early  minimalist avoided it.&quot;</p><p>Daniel Wolf TD 549:25<br/>&gt;In twelve-tone technique, transposition is a fundamental form of<br/>modulation, by transposing particular &gt;tri-, tetra- or hexachords, one is<br/>able to recombine them in order to get varied row orders. I could &gt;hardly<br/>imagine another musical technique so heavily invested in continuous<br/>modulation.</p><p>In this discussion, I believe scholars of 12-tone technique would tend to<br/>side with Keith Grady.  I have heard that the air surrounding the North<br/>American Embassy at Anaphoria is extremely rarefied and lends itself<br/>readily to &quot;straight thinking.&quot;  It seems some people who have made a<br/>lifetime of studying 12-tone music, George Perle in particular, would have<br/>to agree with the Grady view that transposition, rather than &quot;modulation&quot;<br/>is the variational process of 12-tone music.</p><p>It seems the 12-tone system and even the &quot;free atonal&quot; system is so<br/>different from the Riemann &quot;functional harmony&quot; paradigm that calling<br/>12-tone transposition &quot;modulation&quot; is specious.  This also applies to the<br/>transposition of tri-, tetra-, hexachords, mentioned above, whatever.  The<br/>essence is that the system is such a *LINEAR* one, that such modulatory<br/>distinctions essentially do not apply.</p><p>This, of course, all gets back to *definitions* again, but let us cite a<br/>passage from George Perle&apos;s pearly wisdom in _Serial Composition and<br/>Atonality._</p><p>Quote from Perle:  _Serial Composition and Atonality_ Chapter V,<br/>&quot;Simultaneity.&quot;</p><p>...&quot;The total content of the set is here the sole general criterion of<br/>harmonic propriety.  The Schoenbergian set, however, comprises *all* the<br/>notes of the chromatic scale;  its total content, therefore, *CANNOT SERVE<br/>AS A MEANS OF DELIMITING HARMONIC POSSIBILITIES.* [JP caps]  Instead, the<br/>precompositional linear ordering is realized vertically through the<br/>employment of successive groups of contiguous notes of the set as chords.</p><p>&quot;But this device is only one basis of simultaneity.  The *VERTICALIZATION*<br/>of linearly ordered elements imposes certain compositional restrictions<br/>that *QUITE PRECLUDE [Joey&apos;s caps] ITS EXCLUSIVE DETERMINATION OF HARMONIC<br/>RELATIONS.*  And even verticalization, the only harmonic procedure<br/>ostensibly consistent with the premise of linear ordering, *DOES NOT<br/>UNAMBIGUOUSLY REPRESENT* this ordering.</p><p>&quot;In both diatonic tonality and the twelve-tone system a precompositional<br/>harmonic criterion is assumed:  in the former this is the triad; in the<br/>latter it is *ADJACENCY OF THE ELEMENTS IN THE SET.* [JP caps]  Every tonal<br/>combination is either itself a triad or a component of a progression whose<br/>origin and destination are triads.  [JP -- he certainly seems to agree with<br/>the Reimann paradigm here...] In twelve-tone music, however, *SIMULTANEITY<br/>MAY OR MAY NOT* [JP caps] conform to the only ordering principle provided<br/>by the system, and *WHERE IT DOES NOT DO SO* it bears *NO NECESSARY<br/>RELATION* to this principle.&quot;</p><p>Unquote</p><p>To me, the above quotations seem to conform to the general Anaphorian view<br/>that *TRANSPOSITION* is the guiding principle of 12-tone music, related to<br/>*LINEARITY EVEN IN SIMULTENEITY* and the term *modulation* is truly not in<br/>place here.</p><p>In fact, if I can sense the &quot;bias&quot; of some members of this tuning list,<br/>modulation is possibly something lacking in systematic, 12-tET, 12-tone<br/>music...</p><p>Yes, no, maybe, pooh...</p><p>___________________  ____  ___   __   _   _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
