If<br/>you measured some cello concertos I heard, you will see the pitch is all over<br/>the place. The west has the sloppiest intonation.</p><p>&gt; Instead, they<br/>&gt; are distributions or &apos;smears&apos; along the pitch axis, where a certain &apos;note&apos;<br/>&gt; on the scale associated with the underlying maqam may present itself in a<br/>&gt; multitude of pitches depending upon where the music is &apos;coming from&apos; within<br/>&gt; the past few sounds.</p><p>Possibly this could be the results of extended reference as investigated by<br/>Boomsliter and Creel. In might be worth investigating.</p><p>&gt; Therefore, I do not believe a fixed tuning, no matter<br/>&gt; how intricate, is the answer for Turkish music and possibly other musics.</p><p>There is no final answer because the human  ear seems to be at home with small<br/>shifts in tuning. The question becomes what are you going to do with<br/>instruments where a singular pitch has to be chosen in the midst of this smear.<br/>By the accurate articulation in intonation, the &quot;modulation&quot; via the extended<br/>reference, will cause a consistency in meaning in these variations.</p><p>&gt; The concept of &apos;tuning&apos; has to be viewed in a revolutionary manner with a<br/>&gt; fluid  and dynamic structure.</p><p> In almost an organic fashion, with the ability to grow over periods of time.<br/>As a growing thing, it does not discard it s roots. As a mandala, to point<br/>toward an eternity, via its endless cycle.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4255 href="#4255">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/1999 12:37:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>William!<br/>    Could you be so kind as to explain &quot;seyir&quot; to us.

I think others<br/> &gt;mouths are watering also!</p><p>        I will venture an explanation based on my feeble understanding<br/>attained so far.</p><p>        First, a maqam (pl maqamat; turkish makam, pl makamlar) is<br/>basically a mode.  Now, as we all know from reading 16th century<br/>counterpoint textbooks, those church modes were not just *scales*, but<br/>patterns of use within those scales, with certain characterist melodic<br/>phrases and prefered cadences. (Yes, I know there are arguments<br/>against the phrases bit, but I don&apos;t care to deal with that now.)</p><p>        A maqam, like a mode, has a prefered cadence sequence, and a<br/>range of notes, a scale.  Note that some maqamat do *not* repeat the<br/>scale at the octave.  Anyway, I&apos;ve never heard anything about defining<br/>phrases for maqamat, but one major way to distinguish two maqamat with<br/>the same pitch material is to pay attention to what tones are<br/>emphasized in a piece. [Given that the Persian dasgah system does use<br/>melodic phrases as part of the identity of a mode, I&apos;d be very<br/>surprised if there were no element of this in Arabic and Turkish<br/>music, too.]</p><p>        During an improvisation (taqsim, pl taqaasim) -- most of this<br/>music is improvised -- the performer will over the course of the piece<br/>focus on certain regions of the scale of the maqam, with certain notes<br/>anchoring the whole thing.  So, simply using A minor for an example,<br/>we might have a maqam that emphasizes, over the course of a taqsim, A<br/>c e a e c A.  This is pretty western, since it&apos;s just the outline of<br/>the A-minor triad, then the octave, then back down.  The performer<br/>will hit each region surrounding those notes, coming back to those<br/>notes several times, then moving on to the next region.  A different<br/>maqam might emphasize A d e a e d A.  My current understanding is that<br/>5ths are a popular part of these region sequences.</p><p>        Anyway, seyir (derived from Arabic sayr), means something like<br/>&quot;path,&quot; so, the path a melody follows.  Thus, just as in common<br/>practice music where for any piece in a major mode you were expected<br/>to dally about in the key of the dominant for a while, when playing a<br/>piece in maqam rast, you have to play about in certain note regions.</p><p>        This all gets hopelessly muddled because over the course of a<br/>taqsim a good player is also going run (modulate?) through various<br/>maqamat, each with their own seyir, of course.</p><p>        My biggest frustration is that no one has bothered to publish<br/>seyir collections on the web.  I&apos;ve heard of Turkish books of these,<br/>but I&apos;ve never seen one.</p><p>        So, I think the seyir represents a very interesting way to<br/>organize not only improvised music, but any music where you have long,<br/>non-metrical melodies. [Note: a taqsim is very free rhythmically.]</p><p>        So, back to the Sethares question for me: 1) how are the tones<br/>of a seyir related to the cadence note of a maqam? and 2) are certain<br/>maqam -- and their particular seyir more popular on certain<br/>instruments?</p><p>        If you can find the dissertation, &quot;Makam : modal practice in<br/>Turkish art music&quot; by Karl Signell (Seattle : Asian Music<br/>Publications, 1977.) it will give more detail about tuning issues, and<br/>a few examples of a model seyir... though not enough of them to suit<br/>me.</p><p>--<br/>William S.
