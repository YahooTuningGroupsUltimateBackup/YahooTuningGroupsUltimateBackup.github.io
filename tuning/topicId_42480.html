I&apos;ve been away for quite awhile, and still have little time<br/>to participate at the previous level, but I do want to check in.</p><p>I&apos;ve asked this before, but the answer may have changed. I wish to<br/>purchase a keyboard with full midi capability, tuning tables to which<br/>you can download whatever, and ideally, retunable in real time. I&apos;m<br/>going to have to go to the used market, eBay, or whatever, since<br/>funds are severely restricted. I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s possible,<br/>but we need to stay at around $200.</p><p>Also, despite what some here may have perceived as an obsession with<br/>JI, or very close approximations to it, which remains a strong<br/>interest, I have been venturing into the world of 12-tone temperament<br/>design. This discussion is predicated on harmonic tibmres, or at<br/>least quasi-harmonic (e.g., pianos).</p><p>I have especially been fascinated by the prospect of designing well<br/>temperaments with synchronous beating in the triads. The rationale is<br/>simple: If you must have beats, as you clearly must in a 12-tone<br/>temperament, then they should at least have a simple, coherent<br/>relationship to each other, since clean intonation is itself based on<br/>simple, coherent relationships among frequencies.</p><p>In word, or rather, phrase, it is a kind of second-order coherence<br/>phenomenon that partially compensates the necessary compromises in<br/>first-order coherence. The subjective result is remarkably superior<br/>to tunings with random beat relationships, and eliminates the usual<br/>jangle one hears on pianos, for example, tuned in standard ET.</p><p>After considerable work, always heavily supplemented with empirical<br/>experimentation to ensure a practical development track, I have<br/>concluded that beat ratios between the minor and major thirds of<br/>major triads should be the essential concern, since everything else<br/>falls out nicely from there. Also, the only ratios that seem to have<br/>significant aural value over any old random ratio are 2/1 and 3/2.<br/>That is, the minor third beats twice for every once the major third<br/>beats, or three times for every two. This is, of course, analagous to<br/>the octave and perfect fifth in the intonational aspect.</p><p>Mathematically, to achieve the 1.5 (3/2) ratio for a triad, we simply<br/>need to make the fifth just. To achieve a 2/1 ratio, we must temper<br/>the fifth so that it is 1/3rd as flat as the major third is sharp.<br/>Armed with this basic understanding, I began my design work.</p><p>In the process, I made an amazing discovery. If we temper six of the<br/>twelve fifths, namely C, G, D, A, F# and Bb, and start with a quarter<br/>syntonic comma on F#, this creates a 2.0 beat ratio (m3/M3) in the<br/>triad on F#. This is the only triad for which only one of the four<br/>fifths from the root to the major third is tempered. Every other<br/>major third forming a major triad with a tempered fifth in the cycle<br/>encompasses at least two tempered fifths.</p><p>Working backwards from F# toward C and then Bb, we can calculate the<br/>amount by which each tempered fifth must be altered to make each<br/>triad it encompasses beat in a 2.0 ratio. The idea was that since the<br/>most remote keys are farthest from just, they need the most precisely<br/>synchronized beat ratios to compensate.</p><p>The strategy was to start with F# at a perfect 2.0, surrounded by<br/>keys with all just fifths (two before and three after), and work<br/>backwards, tempering each previously designated tempered fifth by an<br/>amount that would yield a perfect 2.0 beat ratio for a triad in root<br/>position on it. Since they all overlap with at least one other<br/>tempered fifth, we could go all the way around to Bb and then total<br/>the amount of tempering on all six fifths to see how much we would<br/>need to fudge in order to null out the Pythagorean comma and come out<br/>with a closed cycle.</p><p>Well, when I totaled up the tempering (with all six tempered fifths<br/>sporting perfect 2.0, and the rest with perfect 1.5 ratios), I was<br/>blown away to discover that the sum was 0.0058 cents less than the<br/>Pythagorean comma! I added this difference to the fifth on C, the<br/>major third of which was at only +7.4 cents, so it was the least<br/>needy of any synchronous compensation. This ruined the theoretically<br/>perfect ratio of 2.0 by changing it to 2.0016 (boo-hoo!).</p><p>This is being published as the Wendell Natural Synchronous Well. This<br/>work has enable me to create a number of synchronous temperaments,<br/>six of which will be included in the next release of Verituner<br/>(<a href="http://www.verituneinc.com">http://www.verituneinc.com</a>), without a doubt the premier electronic<br/>tuning device for professional tuners. They are as follows:</p><p>Wendell Well 2002 (an early one, not fully synchronous, but with<br/>other nice properties)</p><p>Wendell Synchronous ET Equivalent (varies only slightly from ET, but<br/>fully synchronous, the triad on Ab excepted)</p><p>Bold Synchronous Well (M3s from +4.2 on C to +19.6 cents on C# and<br/>Ab)</p><p>Very Mild Synchronous Well (M3s from +7.9 on C to +17.2 on C#, +16.8<br/>cents on Ab)</p><p>Natural Synchronous Well (M3s from +7.4 on C to +17.6 cents on C# and<br/>Ab)</p><p>Synchronous Modified Mean/Well (Designed for Eb through E as playable<br/>keys, but never drops off the cliff, since the M3 on C# is widest at<br/>+21.5 cents. However, the six standard good meantones keys from Bb to<br/>A are significantly nicer than ET, and Eb and E are about like ET.<br/>Its purpose is to enable more historically informed performance than<br/>ET could provide for almost any music intended for meantone, but<br/>without ever having to retune.)</p><p>I have to stop now, but will publish ET offsets for the Natural<br/>later.

Yes, I&apos;m well aware that all the playable triads in 1/7-<br/>comma meantone have perfect 2.0 beat ratios. For precisely that<br/>reason, my modified meantone is a modification of 1/7th comma with an<br/>eye to extending it by a triad on either end of the six normally<br/>playable keys to get 8 playable major and 5 playable minor keys.</p><p>Only three minor keys are actually playable in standard meantones,<br/>since good relative minors is not a sufficient condition. Almost all<br/>music written in minor keys requires good parallel major keys because<br/>of the melodic raising of the sixth and seventh scale degrees and<br/>Picardian thirds. So adding two playable triads makes a substantial<br/>contribution by expanding 6 to 8 for major and 3 to 5 for minor keys.</p><p>You just bought four more playable keys with only two triads. Good<br/>deal, huh?! That is historically what created the motivation for<br/>modified meantones, which ended up turning into well temperaments<br/>over time. That&apos;s exactly what happened to mine without trying. It<br/>demonstrates clearly to me that well temperaments were in the<br/>evolutionary cards for temperament design.</p><p>My favorite straight meantone is 1/5th comma. When you have 1/5th<br/>comma left over for the major third after subtracting 4/5ths from the<br/>full comma, you have -1/5th on the fifth and +1/5th on the third.<br/>This gives exactly 3/1 on the beat ratio, so it&apos;s also a fully<br/>synchronous temperament in all the playable keys. However, a 3.0 beat<br/>ratio eats up a ton of the total Pyathagorean real estate, so you can<br/>use it only once in a fairly bold well temperament.</p><p>Another neat thing about 1/5th-comma is that the minor second is<br/>exactly 15:16, that is, it&apos;s just. This is because the fourth and the<br/>third are raised by the same amount, 1/5th comma. This is only 4.3<br/>cents, so neither the third nor the fifth are severely compromised.<br/>The minor third is, of course, at -8.6, but that&apos;s about half as<br/>detuned as it is in 12-tET. This meantone is also melodically more<br/>normal sounding to modern ears than the ones on the other side of 1/4-<br/>comma, since it&apos;s deviations from just are in the direction of modern<br/>ET instead of away from it.</p><p>If you want a telling demonstration as to just how wide the range is<br/>of melodic possibilities that are compatible with meantones closer<br/>to just than 12-tET, try 2/7th-comma meantone. It&apos;s also synchronous<br/>at +1.5 ratios instead of the -1.5 on just P5s, and is<br/>hanging out in the general neighborhood of Woolhouse&apos;s optimization<br/>for P5s, M3s, and m3s in the triads.</p><p>For my taste, it&apos;s the most pleasingly harmonious, since the<br/>synchrony more than compensates its relatively short distance from<br/>Woolhouse&apos;s 7/26th-comma. But try playing a simple melody on it<br/>without any harmony, especially melodic minor, and it sounds<br/>otherworldly! A good example is the melody from the Coventry<br/>Carol, &quot;Lullay, Lullay&quot;. Try it! Weird! Yet if the melody is played<br/>in the context of harmony, it gets &quot;rationalized&quot; to the ear and<br/>sounds fine!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E; &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2003 11:40:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Wendell &lt;rwendell@c...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you want a telling demonstration as to just how wide the range<br/>is<br/>&gt; of melodic possibilities that are compatible with meantones closer<br/>&gt; to just than 12-tET, try 2/7th-comma meantone.

I don&apos;t know much math beyond trig, analytic<br/>geometry, some elementary statistics, and basic concepts<br/>that are the fossil remains of elementary calculus.

I focus on the beat ratio of m3/M3, since the<br/>fifth beats at a relatively slow rate and is therefore not generally<br/>a major producer of the random beating jangle you hear with some<br/>temperaments like 12-tET. Moreover, when there is a simple ratio of<br/>m3/M3, the relationship of both to the beat rate of the P5 is<br/>automatically also simple.</p><p>By my reckoning, since the third and fifth are both flat, 11/41-comma<br/>meantone has a beat ratio on m3/M3 of approximately +1.1. On the<br/>other hand, since the M3 in 1/4-comma is pure, this beat ratio is<br/>infinite, or perhaps it&apos;s more meaningful to say undefined. The only<br/>beat ratio of significance therefore becomes that of m3/P5, which by<br/>my reckoning is -2.50.

A few months ago I got an<br/>idea for how it might be improved, and I&apos;m not sure this has been<br/>discussed on the list: grounding the tuning of each pitch degree<br/>fairly strongly, but letting the grounding points &quot;ooze&quot; in response<br/>to pressure, so that as one modulated and stayed in a new key, the<br/>chords would become pure over time, without modifying the tuning of a<br/>particular pitch degree so quickly that it was jarring.

The common harmonics<br/>for each of the three possible intervals, the perfect fifth, major<br/>third, and minor third, between any two notes of the triad are<br/>illustrated below, including their frequency relationships with<br/>respect to the root position triad.</p><p>B5  30  (m3) -<br/>&#x9;&#x9;-<br/>&#x9;&#x9;   -<br/>E5  20  (M3) -   -   -  Common Harmonics<br/>&#x9;&#x9;   -<br/>&#x9;&#x9;-<br/>G4  12  (P5) -</p><p>G3  6<br/>E3  5<br/>C3  4</p><p>The beat rate on any interval is defined as the frequency difference<br/>in Hz of the first harmonic common to both pitches. To derive a<br/>linear approximation to the logarithmic conversion from cent<br/>deviations to frequency differences corresponding to beats on the<br/>first common harmonic, we could take several approaches. The approach<br/>used here is generalized and does not even need to refer to the<br/>logarithmic equations.</p><p>The symbols we will use here are:</p><p>F = P5 or Perfect Fifth<br/>M = M3 or Major Third<br/>m = m3 or Minor Third</p><p>We will symbolize pitch deviations in cents as delta and the interval<br/>symbols as defined above. So dM will refer to the deviation in cents<br/>from just of the major third (with  as flat and + as sharp in<br/>the<br/>substituted values during calculation).  In the standard equation for<br/>beat rates in a major triad:</p><p>Q = beat rate on the P5<br/>T =   &quot;   &quot;    &quot;  &quot;  M3<br/>t =   &quot;   &quot;    &quot;  &quot;  m3</p><p>The formula relating these beat rates in the major triad is:</p><p>2t + 3T = 5Q</p><p>We first assume essentially linear changes across the exceedingly<br/>small deviations in pitch in terms of the width of the interval under<br/>consideration. This directly implies that:</p><p>T  = 2k*dM</p><p>and</p><p>t = 3K*dm</p><p>where k is some constant of conversion which we do not have to<br/>determine, since it will cancel out in the process of deriving the<br/>approximation formula for the beat ratio of the minor over the major<br/>third, R:</p><p>R  = t/T = 3k*dm/2k*dM = 1.5(dm/dM)</p><p>We know that the sum of the cent deviations on the major and minor<br/>third equals the deviation of the perfect fifth:</p><p>dF = dM + dm</p><p>so</p><p>dm = dF  dM</p><p>Substituting right side of this equation for dm in the equation for<br/>R3 yields:</p><p>R3 = 1.5 (dF  dM) / dM</p><p>therefore</p><p>R3  = 1.5 (dF/dM 1)</p><p>And also dF/dM = R3/1.5 + 1</p><p>If you ignore the sign of the beat ratio, you will get terribly<br/>different and wrong results. (That&apos;s how I got it, Gene, referring to<br/>my analysis of 11/41-comma meantone.)</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E; &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2003 4:50:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Wendell &lt;rwendell@c...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I would like to understand the derivation of your formula above,<br/>&gt; &gt; because it doesn&apos;t seem right to me...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The signs of the cents deviations don&apos;t matter...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where am I going wrong?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The signs are extremely important.

I repeat that NONE of the<br/>ratios I have cited in describing my work involve the fifth, except<br/>in a couple of places where I was specifically and very explicitly<br/>responding to questions involving ratios with the fifth.</p><p>The reasons I have previously cited for this are:</p><p>1) The beat rates on the fifths in practical well temperaments are<br/>MUCH slower than the beats on the major and minor thirds, and thus<br/>they are a relatively insignificant contributor to the random janglin<br/>typical of equal temperament.</p><p>2) If the ratio of the beat rate on m3 to that on M3 is simple, this<br/>automatically implies a simple relationship of both to the beat rate<br/>on the fifth, since the relationship among the three intervals is<br/>given by the equation 2t + 3T = 5Q, where t, T, and Q are the beat<br/>rates on the minor and major thirds and the perfect fifth<br/>respectively on a given triad in close voiced root position.</p><p>Sometimes, in the recent discussions on this topic, I get the<br/>impression that we somehow think we can just use sophisticated<br/>mathematics to bend things to our will and get good beat synchrony,<br/>say 2.0, on every triad. Well, good luck! I am positive that this is<br/>impossible! Everything is highly interactive. This not chess; it&apos;s<br/>more like Go, if you&apos;re familiar with the Asian game.</p><p>You can&apos;t change anything in a temperament design without affecting<br/>absolutely EVERYTHING else! It is a very tough business unless you<br/>think very holistically. The linear, fragmented, object-rather-than-<br/>context-oriented focus of the typical western scientific mind has<br/>trouble with the kind of thinking this requires. You have to see how<br/>the WHOLE BALLGAME is responding to every little thing you do.</p><p>For example, if you start with a quarter comma on a fifth followed by<br/>three just fifths, you will get a majro third of one syntonic comma S<br/>minus 1/4 comma, leaving it 3/4 comma sharp. This cent ratio of -1/3<br/>on the P5/M3 ratio yields a beat ratio on m3/M3 of 2.0. Please note<br/>that I make NO mention here of a beat ratio involving the fifth. I<br/>use the CENT ratio of the tempering on the fifth and major third to<br/>calculate simple and directly the BEAT ratio of the minor to major<br/>third.</p><p>If you then move to the fifth just previous to the 1/4-comma tempered<br/>fifth, you can calculate the amount by which you must temper that to<br/>get another 2.0 ratio on that fifth. The equation is f = (S - F)/4,<br/>where f is the amount by which you must temper the fifth, S is the<br/>syntonic comma, and F is the total amount of tempering placed on the<br/>other three fifths. I won&apos;t derive that one for you here, but it&apos;s<br/>very simple algebra from my linear approximation formula.</p><p>If, starting from the 1/4 comma, you iterate this process backwards<br/>around the circle of fifths, you will converge relatively quickly at<br/>first toward 1/7-comma, then oscillate slightly above and below it<br/>for awhile, converging on it ever more tightly from either side. The<br/>total tempering when you get to the twelfth fifth will be over 40<br/>cents! So you&apos;re not very close to a closed temperament, are you?</p><p>If you start with 1/7 comma, you will stay there all the way around<br/>and end up with 12/7 comma total for an open temperament called 1/7-<br/>comma meantone. If you go back to the previous strategy, starting<br/>with 1/4 comma, and iterate back to your starting pitch, you will<br/>have a feedback loop that eventually ends up with an oscillating<br/>asymptotic approach to 1/7-comma meantone.</p><p>If you leave a just fifth between the end and beginning of this<br/>cycle, you will create a feedback loop that converges toward an<br/>irregular temperament that is an odd, anomalous well temperament, if<br/>you could call it that. If you open the feedback loop so there is no<br/>overlap, as I did with the natural, but leave all the other fifths<br/>tempered, you will end up with a huge wolf at the break point.</p><p>If you insert untempered fifths at strategic locations that work to<br/>make C the most just key and imitate the historical key color pattern<br/>of well temperaments since Werkmeister, you will end up with my<br/>Natural Synchronous Well.</p><p>Hope this clarifies things a bit.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2003 12:39:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sometimes, in the recent discussions on this topic, I get the<br/>&gt; impression that we somehow think we can just use sophisticated<br/>&gt; mathematics to bend things to our will and get good beat synchrony,<br/>&gt; say 2.0, on every triad.

Well, good luck! I am positive that this<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; impossible!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s impossible for a well-temperament, since it&apos;s 1/7 (or 2/7 comma<br/>&gt; for a -2 brat) comma meantone.

I have answers to your &quot;desiderata&quot; question further<br/>below.</p><p>Everyone, I would like to request of all involved in this thread that<br/>my comments here be understood as referring by default to closed 12-<br/>tone temperaments only. Any reference to other kinds of temperaments<br/>have been in this context for illustrative purposes only. For<br/>example, I referred to 2/7-comma meantone as a meantone example of<br/>beat synchrony between m3/M3, but in the larger context of 12-tone<br/>well temperament.</p><p>I did this as a side note in reference to the main theme and<br/>seemingly deluded myself that I&apos;d made that very clear. When Monz<br/>brought up 2/7-comma meantone, I mistakenly took it as a response to<br/>something I had said and said so later.</p><p>The desiderata I perceive as ideal for an historically based well are<br/>as follows:</p><p>1) C is the most consonant (i.e., most nearly just) key, and we pay<br/>the piper for that most severely around the F#-C#-G# neighborhood.</p><p>2) Almost all historical temperaments are biased toward the sharp<br/>side as implied in the previous point. C# is often the axis around<br/>which the widest thirds occur. This dates all the way back to the<br/>traditional convention of tuning meantones for playable keys between<br/>from Bb major to A major (2 flats to 3 sharps).</p><p>3) The width of the major thirds should becomes progressively wider<br/>as we move away from C in either direction.</p><p>4) The flat side consequently must move more rapidly toward wider<br/>thirds than the sharp side, so Bb should normally have a wider third<br/>on it than D, and so forth. (The Natural has some minor anomalies in<br/>this regard, dictated by teh goal of perfect synchrony. I<br/>have &quot;fixed&quot; some of them in the Very Mild version, but these<br/>anomalies are mild enough to be virtually inaudible inthe first<br/>place.)</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; according to scala, 7/26-comma meantone is (ignoring the<br/>usual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hundredth-of-a-cent error due to the logarithmic<br/>approximation)<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tuning where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Beating of 3/2 = twice 5/4 same.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so am i missing something or is this a seriously synchronous<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temperament?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I get that 7/26-comma has a brat of -15/4, and major beat ratios<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -15/4, 10/21, -14/25<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; minor beat ratios<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -5/2, 7/10, -4/7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which doesn&apos;t seem all that great.

This is what I&apos;ve been trying to say all along!

Sometimes these<br/>discussions get so academically constipated that I can&apos;t seem to go<br/>anywhere with any really practical considerations.</p><p>Convince me that people tuning unisons never heard beats, no matter<br/>how they conceived or named them! The fundamentals in this case are<br/>totally, blatantly obvious in their alternating constructive and<br/>destructive interference in totally regular periodicity! That they<br/>couldn&apos;t hear that well enough to respond to it intuitively is not<br/>credible, no matter what academic &quot;evidence&quot; pretends to support it.<br/>And if they hear beats in unisons and they could tell whether octaves<br/>were in tune, then they could respond to accurately beats on the<br/>second harmonic, no matter how they described or failed to describe<br/>them. The rest is a matter of degree and not principle, right?!</p><p>Using modern pianists to &quot;prove&quot; that people back then didn&apos;t hear<br/>beats is completely without any basis. I am a choral director, and I<br/>know only too much about most other choral directors. Most of them<br/>come from a vocal and/or keyboard background  steeped in &quot;ET&quot; that is<br/>not even worth THAT name more than about once or twice a year or so.<br/>They never tuned anything themselves, not even a flute to a single<br/>pitch, and in terms of accurate intonation, typically have the most<br/>poorly trained ears of anyone involved seriously in the performance<br/>of music. Just listen to some of the so-called &quot;word-class&quot; singers<br/>who perform at the Met!</p><p>And these &quot;musicians&quot; being used as evidence that some of the<br/>greatest musician/composer/theorists that who ever lived and who<br/>often tuned entire keyboard instruments more than once a day couldn&apos;t<br/>hear what THESE modern pianists don&apos;t?!?!?!?!?!? Some of these latter<br/>could retune in record time to accomodate more remote keys in<br/>meantone. The singers in my choirs who have only played piano or sung<br/>in other choirs are typically the worst at both intonation and<br/>following a conductor and generally adapting well to an ensenble<br/>situation. They are usually NOT well-rounded musically.</p><p>Some probably think I&apos;m chauvinistically assuming that what we hear<br/>today applies to what they could hear then. Well, how chauvinistic is<br/>it to assume that only we wonderful moderns with all our scientific<br/>understanding and mathematics could hear beats? They may have taken<br/>however they perceived or intuited their presence so much for granted<br/>they didn&apos;t even feel it was worth mentioning, or didn&apos;t have any<br/>conceptual basis that would have allowed any verbal communication of<br/>the experience. There are, after all, other musical attributes that<br/>fit nicely into that category even today, aren&apos;t there?!</p><p>And there are other means besides a monochord to mathematically<br/>construct accurate tuning models, such as columns of air and lengths<br/>of long, thin metallic objects, etc. This would require only unisons<br/>and octaves to set a temperament accurately. And monchords would at<br/>the very least familiarize musicians with the physical property of<br/>string harmonics, with plainly visible nodes you could touch to HEAR<br/>them.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2003 1:44:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Leonardo Perretti &lt;dombedos@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This is not true for Zarlino.

However, your citing of your<br/>experiments with present-day pianists puzzles me in this context, for<br/>reasons I&apos;ve already outlined at some length in another recent post.</p><p>I wish to concede an important point here, though. I just ran some<br/>calculations on the 2/7- versus 7/26-comma meantones. A difference of<br/>only 0.35 cents in the tempering on the fifths causes the +1.5 beat<br/>ratio in 2/7-comma to change radically to over 3 as I recall (here<br/>away from my HP scientific, +3.75 I think). I agree that this would<br/>make it unlikely that beat synchrony constitutes a compelling<br/>rationale for any preference for that tuning.</p><p>There is one thing I feel we need to maintain clearly in our<br/>awareness, however: The tempering on the fifths for any temperament<br/>is often very small, and varies from one temperament to another by<br/>fractions of a cent in any temperaments anywhere near each other<br/>along the continuum from 1/3- to 1/11-comma meantones. I find it<br/>highly speculative to assume that all the careful weighing and<br/>choosing implied in the documentation often cited on this list from<br/>the long-lived meantone era was strictly theoretical. This is<br/>especially true concerning the plethora of temperaments referred to<br/>as being in use at many junctures along this centuries-long road.</p><p>Even modern equal temperament uses tempering just shy of two cents on<br/>each fifth. The slightest deviation from this by fractions of a cent<br/>in a sequence of several fifths will cause gross cumulative tuning<br/>errors on other intervals, most notably the thirds. This is not a new<br/>problem, of course. Nonetheless we have to deal with it today as much<br/>as ever if we tune aurally. We do this with cross checks and<br/>iterative tuning techniques if we&apos;re conscientious and neither tuning<br/>electronically nor using unisons against an external physical<br/>standard of some sort.</p><p>I don&apos;t pretend to know how they tuned hundreds of years ago.<br/>However, it is difficult to believe they couldn&apos;t hear beats on<br/>unisons, no matter how they interpreted them subjectively, or tune<br/>octaves by ear accurately on reasonably harmonic strings. Or that<br/>with all their advancements in other areas as early as the<br/>Renaissance they were not resourceful enough or musically refined<br/>enough with respect to intonation that they failed to discriminate in<br/>a practically meaningful way among all the different tunings on which<br/>they wrote their discourses. All the evidence seems to me to point in<br/>the opposite direction: that they were much more sophisticated,<br/>refined, and discriminating with regard to intonation than musicians<br/>typically are today.</p><p>I&apos;ve already enumerated many of the reasons for our slack standards<br/>in this regard in other posts from the time I joine this list. Even<br/>so, for the sake of convenience I will posit a few in summary here:</p><p>1) Tuning of keyboards relegated almost exclusively to professional<br/>technicians who are often notmusicians themselves</p><p>2) Consequent elimination of the daily need to confront finer<br/>(microtonal) pitch discrepancies commonly commonplace for musicians<br/>in previous eras</p><p>3) Consequent elimination from the awareness of a huge portion of<br/>modern musicians that such discrepancies even exist</p><p>4) Grossly infrequent tuning of keyboard instruments, most notably<br/>pianos, resulting in the &quot;training&quot; of modern ears to tolerate<br/>incredibly poor intonation on a daily basis</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob   :)</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2003 5:43:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p>    Obviously people have been tuning quite accurately for thousands of years without science . half the world still does and those culture which relies most on science seems to have the worst ears in relation to pitch.

I just ran some<br/>&gt; calculations on the 2/7- versus 7/26-comma meantones. A difference<br/>of<br/>&gt; only 0.35 cents in the tempering on the fifths causes the +1.5 beat<br/>&gt; ratio in 2/7-comma to change radically to over 3 as I recall (here<br/>&gt; away from my HP scientific, +3.75 I think). I agree that this would<br/>&gt; make it unlikely that beat synchrony constitutes a compelling<br/>&gt; rationale for any preference for that tuning.</p><p>thank you robert. that&apos;s all i was arguing. and, obliquely, this was<br/>the point i was trying to make by mentioning 7/25-comma meantone,<br/>which is so close to 2/7, and also &quot;optimal&quot; according to certain<br/>criteria, but whose beat rate ratios already depart markedly from<br/>those of 2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is one thing I feel we need to maintain clearly in our<br/>&gt; awareness, however: The tempering on the fifths for any temperament<br/>&gt; is often very small, and varies from one temperament to another by<br/>&gt; fractions of a cent in any temperaments anywhere near each other<br/>&gt; along the continuum from 1/3- to 1/11-comma meantones. I find it<br/>&gt; highly speculative to assume that all the careful weighing and<br/>&gt; choosing implied in the documentation often cited on this list from<br/>&gt; the long-lived meantone era was strictly theoretical. This is<br/>&gt; especially true concerning the plethora of temperaments referred to<br/>&gt; as being in use at many junctures along this centuries-long road.</p><p>after mersenne, these things exploded into the world of accurate<br/>verifiability and testability (if that&apos;s a word). that&apos;s where its<br/>useful to have a historical roadmap like jorgenson to look at.<br/>zarlino&apos;s was the *first* theorist to put forward a meantone<br/>temperament in methematically precise form. explicit knowledge of<br/>beats, harmonics, and aural tuning rules came later, but still early<br/>in the centuries-long meantone era.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even modern equal temperament uses tempering just shy of two cents<br/>on<br/>&gt; each fifth. The slightest deviation from this by fractions of a<br/>cent<br/>&gt; in a sequence of several fifths will cause gross cumulative tuning<br/>&gt; errors on other intervals, most notably the thirds. This is not a<br/>new<br/>&gt; problem, of course. Nonetheless we have to deal with it today as<br/>much<br/>&gt; as ever if we tune aurally. We do this with cross checks and<br/>&gt; iterative tuning techniques if we&apos;re conscientious and neither<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; electronically nor using unisons against an external physical<br/>&gt; standard of some sort.</p><p>jorgenson describes all these checks in painful detail for hundreds<br/>of historical temperaments. that&apos;s what makes the book so big and<br/>weighty.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t pretend to know how they tuned hundreds of years ago.<br/>&gt; However, it is difficult to believe they couldn&apos;t hear beats on<br/>&gt; unisons, no matter how they interpreted them subjectively, or tune<br/>&gt; octaves by ear accurately on reasonably harmonic strings.</p><p>agreed.</p><p>&gt; Or that<br/>&gt; with all their advancements in other areas as early as the<br/>&gt; Renaissance they were not resourceful enough or musically refined<br/>&gt; enough with respect to intonation that they failed to discriminate<br/>in<br/>&gt; a practically meaningful way among all the different tunings on<br/>which<br/>&gt; they wrote their discourses.</p><p>zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma proposal was the first ever made with<br/>mathematical precision. that&apos;s what we were arguing about, and it<br/>happened in 1558. by 1571(?), another possibility was in the air --<br/>1/4-comma meantone -- and zarlino changed his preference to this.<br/>there were no other alteratives yet defined at this time, except 1/3-<br/>comma meantone by salinas. 1/5-comma and 1/6-comma came a bit later.</p><p>&gt; All the evidence seems to me to point in<br/>&gt; the opposite direction: that they were much more sophisticated,<br/>&gt; refined, and discriminating with regard to intonation than<br/>musicians<br/>&gt; typically are today.</p><p>by 1640 or so, this was undoubtedly true.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve already enumerated many of the reasons for our slack standards<br/>&gt; in this regard in other posts from the time I joine this list.

Or something else?</p><p>This is an interesting point.</p><p>In the chapters preceding the 42, Zarlino goes extensively through the ancient musical theory, mostly as described by Ptolemy and Boethius, and at the end he concludes that the best musical system for the &quot;modern&quot; music is the Greater Perfect System joined with the Lesser Perfect System, built by the &quot;Syntonic Diatonic&quot; tetrachord, also defined as the &quot;Tense Diatonic&quot; (16/15 x 9/8 x 10/9) by other writers. As known, the two mentioned systems were made with a total of five tetrachords, the classical Hypaton, Meson, Diezeugmenon and Hyperbolaion to build the GPS, with the addition of the Synemmenon joint to the Meson to complete the LPS. All this is illustrated in the figure of the divided monochord in the cap 40.<br/>See the diagrams in Monzo&apos;s web page with the translated chapters.</p><p>In short, by this construction Zarlino individuates the comma as a difference between the Nete Synemmenon and the Paranete Diezeugmenon, that both should correspond to the second D of the scale (points R and M). In cap. 40 Zarlino clearly states that the Comma, &quot;while is not useable in any genus, it is not born without any use, as by it many consonances could be gained&quot;, and &quot;in the artificial instruments it is divided by mean of its distribution, that is made between many intervals, between eight strings, as we will see elsewhere&quot;.<br/>In the following chapters Zarlino describes his temperament starting from the previously built scale, where the only evident comma is the above mentioned, so when he says that there is someone who uses to simply split comma (which in the monochord is placed between the points R and M) between the two adjacent intervals he refers to *that* comma, it means that the two strings R and M were unified in a unique string placed half-way (harmonically), so that the comma is divided between the intervals N-RM and RM-L, the remaining scale remaining untempered. I don&apos;t know if this was a general use, or just an erudite discussion between scholars.</p><p>Another point.<br/>The main reason why Zarlino used 2/7 - and here we turn to Monz&apos;s original question - seems to be the necessity of obtaining all the intervals of the same kind equal one another, as he clearly and repeatedly states through the  cap. 42 and 43.</p><p>Why 2/7?<br/>The most logical line of thought seems the following. As seen before, Zarlino takes into consideration only the Diatonic &quot;syntonic&quot; genus, i.e. the diatonic scale; this is made of eight strings and, consequently, seven intervals, so he tries by dividing the comma in seven parts. In doing that, he not only distributes the comma, but also reorganizes the intervals, and makes it in such a way, that all the intervals of the same kind are equalized.<br/>The actual procedure he uses is &quot;clearly&quot; explained in the cap. 43, and the figure is explicative, particularly in the upper band.</p><p>It is interesting to note that Zarlino almost certainly was not aware in 1558 of the 1/4 temperament; in Cap. 47 he describes the utility of the addition of the strings of the Enarmonic thetrachord, and concludes that it is useful in that it offers a way to obtain the pure thirds, settling them on additional red keys. This would have no sense with 1/4.<br/>I don&apos;t know the evolution of his theory in the next edition of his treatise.</p><p>Comments?</p><p>Leonardo Perretti</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2003 5:00:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Leonardo Perretti &lt;dombedos@t...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; so when he says that there is someone who uses to<br/>&gt; simply split comma (which in the monochord is placed between the<br/>&gt; points R and M) between the two adjacent intervals he refers to<br/>&gt; *that* comma, it means that the two strings R and M were unified in<br/>a<br/>&gt; unique string placed half-way (harmonically), so that the comma is<br/>&gt; divided between the intervals N-RM and RM-L, the remaining scale<br/>&gt; remaining untempered.

For example, A should be the same &quot;distance&quot; from D<br/>as from E -- in other words, the fifths D-A and A-E should be tempered<br/>from &quot;perfection&quot; by the same quantity.</p><p>As far as I&apos;m concerned, this is enough to justify listing Aaron&apos;s<br/>instructions as a description the procedure for obtaining 1/4-comma<br/>meantone -- as various authors have done, and Paul does in his table.<br/>Further, Aaron adds after his C-G-D-A-E series of fifths that F should<br/>be tuned by a similar but opposite procedure, making F in the fifth<br/>F-C &quot;a little high, passing a bit beyond perfection.&quot; If one assumes<br/>symmetry, then 1/4-comma meantone indeed results.</p><p>Correctly pointing out that Aaron&apos;s instructions do not give a<br/>mathematical description of 1/4-comma meantone, or explicitly direct<br/>that all major thirds be made pure, Lindley raises the question of<br/>what Aaron means by his statement that &quot;thirds and sixths are blunted<br/>or diminished&quot; in this temperament.</p><p>One interpretation which occurs to me is that Aaron is comparing<br/>meantone _major_ thirds and sixths with the same intervals in a<br/>Pythagorean tuning with pure fifths -- where they are indeed somewhat<br/>larger. Lindley emphasizes such ambiguous statements to argue that<br/>Aaron&apos;s instructions do specify 1/4-comma for the first notes<br/>C-G-D-A-E, but might lend themselves to various slightly irregular<br/>tunings for the other fifths and thirds.</p><p>Another point made by Lindley is that Aaron uses the adjective<br/>_giusta_ (&quot;just&quot;) to refer not only to his initial octave and major<br/>third (where &quot;pure&quot; is an attractive reading), but also for the<br/>temperament as a whole -- _participatione &amp; acordo giusto &amp; buono_, &quot;a<br/>just and good temperament and tuning.&quot; However, Lindley himself is<br/>ready to accept Aaron&apos;s opening C-G-D-A-E with its &quot;sonorous and just&quot;<br/>major third C-E as a description of 1/4-comma. His statement about the<br/>octave C-C and major third C-E being as sonorous or &quot;united&quot; as<br/>possible would support this conclusion even we assume that &quot;just&quot; may<br/>mean simply &quot;euphonious&quot; or &quot;pleasing.&quot;</p><p>In his instructions for the final stage of the temperament, the tuning<br/>of the sharps, Aaron directs that C#, tuned in relation to the fifth<br/>A-E, should be a major third from A and a minor third from E, and<br/>likewise with F# in relation to the fifth D-A, etc.</p><p>From one viewpoint, this language may simply be reminding the student<br/>of the locations of major and minor thirds involving accidentals.<br/>Lindley, however, pursuing his argument that a regular 1/4-comma<br/>temperament is not _necessarily_ implied, argues that one _could_ read<br/>this language to suggest something like Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone<br/>for the temperament of the sharps, with major and minor thirds<br/>compromised by about the same amount from pure.</p><p>In arguing that Aaron&apos;s tuning is not _necessarily_ a regular<br/>1/4-comma meantone, Lindley may have two motivations. First, he wishes<br/>to emphasize that Aaron&apos;s instructions are not mathematically precise;<br/>and indeed, I would agree that Zarlino (1571) and Salinas (1577) may<br/>be the first known theorists to give such mathematical definitions of<br/>1/4-comma and other meantone temperaments.</p><p>Secondly, Lindley wants to correct the view that 1/4-comma was a<br/>universal standard in the 16th century. Since Aaron&apos;s instructions are<br/>often taken as the paradigm case of this tuning, showing that they are<br/>actually open to more than one interpretation would fit with his<br/>larger campaign against &quot;1/4-comma hegemony.&quot;</p><p>However, I find it noteworthy that without invoking any complex<br/>mathematical concepts or even defining a syntonic comma, Aaron has<br/>described in what I find beautiful as well as musicianly terms the<br/>idea of tuning a pure major third and then dividing it into four<br/>equally tempered fifths. Aaron&apos;s remaining instructions, including his<br/>suggestion of a similar but opposite tempering of fifths in the flat<br/>direction (F-C, and then Bb-F and Eb-Bb), permit a regular 1/4-comma<br/>temperament, even if they do not compel it or define it in<br/>mathematical terms.</p><p>If I were making a table like Paul&apos;s, I might list Aaron for 1/4-comma<br/>and add a footnote or annotation like this:</p><p>&quot;Aaron evidently describes a temperament with a pure major third C-E<br/>and equally narrowed fifths for his first five notes C-G-D-A-E, with<br/>further instructions permitting but not explicitly specifying that<br/>other major thirds are pure; Zarlino (1571) and Salinas (1577) give<br/>mathematically precise descriptions of a regular 1/4-comma tuning.&quot;&apos;</p><p>monz might want to revise some statements on his 1/4-comma meantone<br/>page after rereading the above.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2003 1:19:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>my take on this was that when Zarlino described<br/>what was apparently a 5-limit JI diatonic scale<br/>with a literal meantone subsituted for the both<br/>9/8 and 10/9, he was referring to Aron&apos;s _Toscanello_.</p><p>Leonardo, would you agree or disagree with this?<br/>you&apos;ve read Aron, and i haven&apos;t.</p><p>( ... well, i&apos;ve read the Italian original text,<br/>and don&apos;t understand much of it ... )</p><p>-monz</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Leonardo Perretti&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dombedos@tiscalinet.it">dombedos@tiscalinet.it</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, March 13, 2003 2:21 PM<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Zarlino&apos;s 2/7 (was: A question and an update...)</p><p>&gt; Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  It is interesting to note that Zarlino almost certainly was not aware<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  in 1558 of the 1/4 temperament; in Cap. 47 he describes the utility<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  of the addition of the strings of the Enarmonic thetrachord, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  concludes that it is useful in that it offers a way to obtain the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  pure thirds, settling them on additional red keys.

The diatonic semitones are minor. He does not specify the sizes of the intervals, but all the construction seems to lead to a Pythagorean scale starting from Bb, with the Pythagorean comma set on D#-Eb (of course). He clearly affirms that the temperament he describes in the following chapter is referred to this monochord.<br/>Aaron does not build his monochord stepping by fifths, but by the degrees of the diatonic scale, using both the Greek, and usual names. The black keys are described as long as they appear between the diatonic degrees. I will provide a translation, perhaps tomorrow.</p><p>About the paper by Margo, I believe I have not the authority to discuss or criticize her affirmations, nor the ones of Mark Lindley; anyway, here are some comments about Aaron&apos;s cap. 41.</p><p>Aaron starts saying that the temperament has to  be made in three parts.<br/>The first part essentially describes how to temper the diatonic notes, excluding F, with pure thirds; then the fifths, that are prescribed to be equal, should be 1/4, as universally agreed. No doubts about that.</p><p>The second part describes how to temper F, Bb and Eb, that must be three equal fifths, tuned by descending.<br/>Apropos of this Margo wrote:</p><p>&gt;Further, Aaron adds after his C-G-D-A-E series of fifths that F should<br/>&gt;be tuned by a similar but opposite procedure, making F in the fifth<br/>&gt;F-C &quot;a little high, passing a bit beyond perfection.&quot; If one assumes<br/>&gt;symmetry, then 1/4-comma meantone indeed results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Correctly pointing out that Aaron&apos;s instructions do not give a<br/>&gt;mathematical description of 1/4-comma meantone, or explicitly direct<br/>&gt;that all major thirds be made pure, Lindley raises the question of<br/>&gt;what Aaron means by his statement that &quot;thirds and sixths are blunted<br/>&gt;or diminished&quot; in this temperament.</p><p>The expression: &quot;thirds and sixths are blunted or diminished&quot;, seems to contradict the previous statement that the thirds have to be &quot;sonorous and just.&quot;. Actually, it becomes coherent when one considers that this is comprised in the second section of the description of the temperament; then, it refer to the notes involved there only, that are F, Bb and Eb, as well as the previous statement refers to notes of the first section. The three parts of the temperament are very well separated in the original text.<br/>In view of that, here is my opinion.<br/>As known, the third become diminished if made with fifths accumulating a diminution of more than (-)1 sc, and the sixth with negative corrections greater then 4/3 sc.. Then, probably Aaron prescribed corrections equal or greater then 1/3 for these fifths. The thirds and sixths become diminished and all returns coherent with the text.</p><p>The third part specifies how to temper the &quot;major semitones&quot;, that have to be tempered &quot;between their thirds&quot;. The &quot;major semitones&quot; are the black keys that were built on the monochord with the major semitone in the low side of the tone that comprises it. They are C#, F# and G#. The C# has be tempered against A and E, &quot;so much that it remains in the middle major third with A, and minor with E&quot;. As for Lindley in Margo paper, it should mean something like Zarlino&apos;s 2/7. The same is for F#.<br/>G# is not mentioned but it could be inferred that it follows the same prescriptions.</p><p>The hole that opens between G# and Eb is not really bigger then in some variants of the regular middletones. In the description of the monochord, anyway, in cap. 40 Aaron talks of splitting the Eb, so that the convenient intervals (before temperament) could be obtained.</p><p>Is this hypothesis teneable? Is it musically likely? I don&apos;t feel entitled to make those evaluations.

For example, A should be the same &quot;distance&quot; from D<br/>&gt; as from E -- in other words, the fifths D-A and A-E should be<br/>tempered<br/>&gt; from &quot;perfection&quot; by the same quantity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As far as I&apos;m concerned, this is enough to justify listing Aaron&apos;s<br/>&gt; instructions as a description the procedure for obtaining 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; meantone -- as various authors have done, and Paul does in his<br/>table.<br/>&gt; Further, Aaron adds after his C-G-D-A-E series of fifths that F<br/>should<br/>&gt; be tuned by a similar but opposite procedure, making F in the fifth<br/>&gt; F-C &quot;a little high, passing a bit beyond perfection.&quot; If one assumes<br/>&gt; symmetry, then 1/4-comma meantone indeed results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correctly pointing out that Aaron&apos;s instructions do not give a<br/>&gt; mathematical description of 1/4-comma meantone, or explicitly direct<br/>&gt; that all major thirds be made pure, Lindley raises the question of<br/>&gt; what Aaron means by his statement that &quot;thirds and sixths are<br/>blunted<br/>&gt; or diminished&quot; in this temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One interpretation which occurs to me is that Aaron is comparing<br/>&gt; meantone _major_ thirds and sixths with the same intervals in a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning with pure fifths -- where they are indeed<br/>somewhat<br/>&gt; larger. Lindley emphasizes such ambiguous statements to argue that<br/>&gt; Aaron&apos;s instructions do specify 1/4-comma for the first notes<br/>&gt; C-G-D-A-E, but might lend themselves to various slightly irregular<br/>&gt; tunings for the other fifths and thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another point made by Lindley is that Aaron uses the adjective<br/>&gt; _giusta_ (&quot;just&quot;) to refer not only to his initial octave and major<br/>&gt; third (where &quot;pure&quot; is an attractive reading), but also for the<br/>&gt; temperament as a whole -- _participatione &amp; acordo giusto &amp;<br/>buono_, &quot;a<br/>&gt; just and good temperament and tuning.&quot; However, Lindley himself is<br/>&gt; ready to accept Aaron&apos;s opening C-G-D-A-E with its &quot;sonorous and<br/>just&quot;<br/>&gt; major third C-E as a description of 1/4-comma. His statement about<br/>the<br/>&gt; octave C-C and major third C-E being as sonorous or &quot;united&quot; as<br/>&gt; possible would support this conclusion even we assume that &quot;just&quot;<br/>may<br/>&gt; mean simply &quot;euphonious&quot; or &quot;pleasing.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In his instructions for the final stage of the temperament, the<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; of the sharps, Aaron directs that C#, tuned in relation to the fifth<br/>&gt; A-E, should be a major third from A and a minor third from E, and<br/>&gt; likewise with F# in relation to the fifth D-A, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From one viewpoint, this language may simply be reminding the<br/>student<br/>&gt; of the locations of major and minor thirds involving accidentals.<br/>&gt; Lindley, however, pursuing his argument that a regular 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; temperament is not _necessarily_ implied, argues that one _could_<br/>read<br/>&gt; this language to suggest something like Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone<br/>&gt; for the temperament of the sharps, with major and minor thirds<br/>&gt; compromised by about the same amount from pure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In arguing that Aaron&apos;s tuning is not _necessarily_ a regular<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone, Lindley may have two motivations. First, he<br/>wishes<br/>&gt; to emphasize that Aaron&apos;s instructions are not mathematically<br/>precise;<br/>&gt; and indeed, I would agree that Zarlino (1571) and Salinas (1577) may<br/>&gt; be the first known theorists to give such mathematical definitions<br/>of<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma and other meantone temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secondly, Lindley wants to correct the view that 1/4-comma was a<br/>&gt; universal standard in the 16th century. Since Aaron&apos;s instructions<br/>are<br/>&gt; often taken as the paradigm case of this tuning, showing that they<br/>are<br/>&gt; actually open to more than one interpretation would fit with his<br/>&gt; larger campaign against &quot;1/4-comma hegemony.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I find it noteworthy that without invoking any complex<br/>&gt; mathematical concepts or even defining a syntonic comma, Aaron has<br/>&gt; described in what I find beautiful as well as musicianly terms the<br/>&gt; idea of tuning a pure major third and then dividing it into four<br/>&gt; equally tempered fifths. Aaron&apos;s remaining instructions, including<br/>his<br/>&gt; suggestion of a similar but opposite tempering of fifths in the flat<br/>&gt; direction (F-C, and then Bb-F and Eb-Bb), permit a regular 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; temperament, even if they do not compel it or define it in<br/>&gt; mathematical terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I were making a table like Paul&apos;s, I might list Aaron for 1/4-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; and add a footnote or annotation like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Aaron evidently describes a temperament with a pure major third C-E<br/>&gt; and equally narrowed fifths for his first five notes C-G-D-A-E, with<br/>&gt; further instructions permitting but not explicitly specifying that<br/>&gt; other major thirds are pure; Zarlino (1571) and Salinas (1577) give<br/>&gt; mathematically precise descriptions of a regular 1/4-comma tuning.&quot;&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; monz might want to revise some statements on his 1/4-comma meantone<br/>&gt; page after rereading the above.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2003 4:06:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi paul,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, March 14, 2003 5:18 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Zarlino&apos;s 2/7 (was: A question and an update...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; thanks, paul.  the most expedient way to do it<br/>&gt; &gt; was to simply add the quote from Margo at the<br/>&gt; &gt; end of the page, which i&apos;ve done.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/1-4cmt.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/1-4cmt.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the beginning of the page, unfortunately, contains some misleading<br/>&gt; statements (if you&apos;ll allow the criticism) . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;the paradigms postulated by &quot;common-practice&quot; music-theory to a<br/>&gt; great extent depend on . . . the fact that &quot;flats&quot; are higher in<br/>&gt; pitch than &quot;sharps&quot;&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not true, since the &apos;expressive intonation&apos; paradigm introduced<br/>&gt; c.1800 fits just as snugly with common-practice paradigms even though<br/>&gt; it has the opposite tendency<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;1/4-comma meantone was assumed as the standard tuning in most of<br/>&gt; Europe from approximately 1500 to 1700&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this is the statement i hoped margo&apos;s post would lead you to weaken --<br/>&gt;  i certainly see no reason to &quot;assume&quot; that all of the other meantone<br/>&gt; tunings described by salinas and rossi were &quot;non-standard&quot; during<br/>&gt; this time.</p><p>how&apos;s this?

It would probably be fair to say that most<br/>&gt;&gt; instrumental music of the Renaissance and Baroque periods<br/>&gt;&gt; was intended to be played in 1/4-comma meantone or a<br/>&gt;&gt; close relative, and even after the growth in popularity<br/>&gt;&gt; of well-temperaments for keyboards after 1700, some form<br/>&gt;&gt; of meantone (generally more like 1/6-comma or 55edo) was<br/>&gt;&gt; usually still intended for orchestral music.</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... anything from 2/7-comma to 3/14-<br/>&gt; comma meantone (and beyond) can be justified by plausible optimality<br/>&gt; criteria, and would probably not have sounded out-of-place for the<br/>&gt; body of western music from 1500 to 1700.</p><p>i&apos;ve added some commentary here:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/meantone-error/meantone-error.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/meantone-error/meantone-error.htm</a></p><p>which explains some of this.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2003 12:58:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; how&apos;s this?
