Help!!!!!<br/>Some of you guys have some incredible stuff out there and archive<br/>posts are very informative! I tend to lean towards more free jazz-<br/>improv and atonal playing...I&apos;ve been experimenting playing various<br/>keys against each other &amp; I think this has led me to the microtonal<br/>soundscape..........looking forward to lots more...wow!!!!!!!!</p><p>Thanks!

Welcome to the Tuning List!
