In particular, four steps is an excellent 9/7, and one step a<br/>fine 16/15. Three steps gives the same minor third as 22-equal, two<br/>steps the same 8/7, and five steps the same 11/8. Put this all<br/>together and it looks like</p><p>1--16/15--8/7--6/5--9/7--11/8--16/11--14/9--5/3--7/4--15/8</p><p>Various chords are possible, such as 1--11/8--7/4 and the<br/>1--9/7--5/3 augmented triad.</p><p>13-equal seems more limited, but six steps is an excellent 11/8 and<br/>3 steps a decent 7/6. The 0-3-6 chord is therefore a consideration,<br/>and the 0-3-6-9 chord has a 9 which serves as 13/8, so this is an<br/>approximate 1--7/6--11/8--13/8 bit of magic which should have<br/>something of a diminished seventh sound if someone wants to try it.</p></div><h3>Rick Tagawa &#x3C;ricktagawa@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2004 10:56:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On the Bohlen-Pierce site Heinz Bolen in the article from September 18, 1999 &quot;A 833 Cents Scale&quot; actually discusses 36ET.

I was<br/>also experimenting with this scale and I found lots of interesting things<br/>about it.

Now it seems to me that this idea of<br/>dividing Phi must have actually come from the opposite - that is<br/>multiplication. About 3 hours ago, I was trying to find an integer power of<br/>Phi that is suitably close to any integer power of 2. After multiplying Phi<br/>by itself for the 36th time (at that time I was thinking of giving it all<br/>up), I got just under 2^25. When I converted it, I found a difference of<br/>only about 8.7 cents. Hmmm, great. So if Phi^36 is close to 2^25, then 25/36<br/>of an octave is close to the factor of Phi itself. In fact, this is just the<br/>same as what you&apos;re speaking about! I&apos;m pretty surprised, where did you get<br/>it?<br/>Petr</p></div>
