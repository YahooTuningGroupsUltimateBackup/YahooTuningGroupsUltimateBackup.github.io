The show<br/>was an episode of  SUSPENSE called &quot;The 13th Sound&quot; starring Agnes<br/>Morehead as an hysterically nervous murderess whose dying husband had<br/>scraped his nails down the side of a house after she shot him. Later,<br/>she attends a chamber music concert in which the first piece on the<br/>program is a quarter-tone composition, &quot;The 13th Sound&quot; by &quot;young Julian<br/>Carrillo.&quot; She becomes hysterical upon hearing the quarter-tones and<br/>this episode leads to her eventual exposure and confession.</p><p>Unfortunately, all one hears is a string quartet tuning up and playing<br/>briefly out of tuneThe piece was described as having been controversial<br/>in New York a week or so earlier, but as far as I know, Carrillo called<br/>his movement Sonido Trece, but never applied it to any single piece. The<br/>date of the original broadcast was Feb 13, 1947.  I didn&apos;t quite catch<br/>the writers&apos; names but they sounded something like &quot;Kathy Lewis (and her<br/>husband).&quot;</p><p>The second is that I have finally located a copy of the 1992 edition of<br/>J.R. Pierce&apos;s &quot;The Science of Musical Sound,&quot; and I haven&apos;t found any<br/>place where he is terribly critical of   Plomp and Levelt&apos;s  theory of<br/>sensory consonance. He does say that it doesn&apos;t explain common-practice<br/>harmony, but then, I don&apos;t recall them making  very strong claims that<br/>it did, either. Pierce does say that some listeners prefer wide 12-tet<br/>thirds to JI ones and that violinists do not use JI when performing<br/>western music, but that&apos;s nothing new. He does say  that Barber Shop<br/>quartets and some early music may be in JI.</p><p>Finally, I was at panel discussion Friday at UCSD and heard Gerald<br/>Balzano, David Wessel and Steve McAdams discuss musical form and time<br/>relations. Balzano was surprised to hear that his CMJ article was still<br/>being referred to on the Tuning List.</p><p>The take-home lesson from the panel is that most listeners cannot<br/>perceive musical forms longer than  5-7 seconds unless specially trained<br/>and attentive. Roger Reynolds, the moderator, described an experiment in<br/>which  a Mozart piano sonata was cut into 2 measure segments and<br/>randomly reassembled. When the resulting score was played by a pianist,<br/>most ordinary listeners perceived nothing odd, though those with musical<br/>training thought there was something vaguely wrong with the piece.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=36522 href="#36522">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2002 12:34:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Chalmers wrote...<br/> &gt;The take-home lesson from the panel is that most listeners cannot<br/> &gt;perceive musical forms longer than  5-7 seconds unless specially trained<br/> &gt;and attentive.

and &apos;harmony&apos;, by<br/>Terhardt at least.</p><p>the point is that one cannot simply take the relationships between<br/>spectra and tuning present in common-practice music, or any other<br/>style, preserve those relationships under some arbitrary (let&apos;s say<br/>continuous) mapping from frequency to frequency, and expect the<br/>result to be remotely musical, even as regards preserving the<br/>consonance/dissonance patterns. and yet this is exactly the<br/>impression that one gets from most of Sethares&apos;s writings.</p><p>i&apos;d love to hear dissenting opinions about this,<br/>paul</p></div><h3><a id=36569 href="#36569">ðŸ”—</a>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2002 8:57:47 PM</span><button style="float: right;
