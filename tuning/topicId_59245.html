Instead of the apotome sharp and flat, I get to see their<br/>enharmonical respellings. Shouldn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t the apotome accidentals have the<br/>priority with keyboard mapping?</p><p>The compatibility of basic 79MOS notation with 72tET is all the more<br/>encouraging. Probably this means that the AFMM orchestra can interpret and<br/>perform 79MOS when reading 72tET notation.</p><p>I like the way F# can be made enharmonically equivalent to Gb this way:</p><p>C-(702)-G-(694)-D-(702)-A-(694)-E-(702)-B-(694)-F#</p><p>C-(702)-F-(709)-Bb-(702)-Eb-(694)-Ab-(702)-Db-(702)-Gb</p><p>Such flexibility in notation is crucial to the correct representation of<br/>Maqams.</p><p>I experimented with the 159, 19, 38 and 57n notations, but am most<br/>comfortable when starting out with E79. I can then re-interpret all the<br/>notes depending on the fifth I may use in the cycle. Thus, E can be the<br/>26th, 27th or even the 28th step depending on my preferance. Hence the<br/>distinction between Rast and Suz-i Dilara is only a matter of theoretical<br/>nuance, not notational jargon.</p><p>While I understand that notating 159 requires 7 symbols per half-tone, you<br/>should realize that I allow myself to use only 3 up to the apotome. The<br/>first should be the Tartini quarter-tone sharp/flat, the second should be<br/>the slashed flat in Maqam Music and its sharp equivalent, and the third<br/>should be the regular sharp and flat. All the pitches of 79 MOS should be<br/>represented by this arrangement.</p><p>True, 41 won&iuml;&iquest;&half;t work anymore, but 123 might. I found this to be the smallest<br/>ET (41*3) that suits the kind of notational twizzle I have in mind.</p><p>For theory on paper, I have revised the 55 MOS out of 277tET:</p><p>  0:          1/1           C          unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         21.654 cents   C)<br/>  2:         43.308 cents   C))<br/>  3:         64.962 cents   C#(<br/>  4:         86.617 cents   C#   Db(<br/>  5:        108.271 cents   C#)  Db<br/>  6:        129.925 cents   Db)<br/>  7:        151.579 cents   D((<br/>  8:        173.233 cents   D(<br/>  9:        194.887 cents   D<br/> 10:        216.541 cents   D)<br/> 11:        238.195 cents   D))<br/> 12:        259.850 cents   D#(<br/> 13:        281.504 cents   D#   Eb(<br/> 14:        303.158 cents   D#)  Eb<br/> 15:        324.812 cents   Eb)<br/> 16:        346.466 cents   E((<br/> 17:        368.120 cents   E(<br/> 18:        389.774 cents   E<br/> 19:        411.428 cents   E)   Fb<br/> 20:        433.083 cents   E))  Fb)<br/> 21:        454.737 cents   E#(  F((<br/> 22:        476.391 cents   E#   F(<br/> 23:        498.045 cents   F<br/> 24:        519.699 cents   F)<br/> 25:        541.353 cents   F))<br/> 26:        563.007 cents   F#(<br/> 27:        584.662 cents   F#   Gb(<br/> 28:        606.316 cents   F#)  Gb<br/> 29:        627.970 cents   Gb)<br/> 30:        649.624 cents   G((<br/> 31:        671.278 cents   G(<br/> 32:        701.955 cents   G<br/> 33:        723.609 cents   G)<br/> 34:        745.263 cents   G))<br/> 35:        766.917 cents   G#(<br/> 36:        788.572 cents   G#   Ab(<br/> 37:        810.226 cents   G#)  Ab<br/> 38:        831.880 cents   Ab)<br/> 39:        853.534 cents   A((<br/> 40:        875.188 cents   A(<br/> 41:        896.842 cents   A<br/> 42:        918.496 cents   A)<br/> 43:        940.150 cents   A))<br/> 44:        961.805 cents   A#(<br/> 45:        983.459 cents   A#   Bb(<br/> 46:       1005.113 cents   A#)  Bb<br/> 47:       1026.767 cents   Bb)<br/> 48:       1048.421 cents   B((<br/> 49:       1070.075 cents   B(<br/> 50:       1091.729 cents   B<br/> 51:       1113.383 cents   B)   Cb<br/> 52:       1135.038 cents   B))  Cb)<br/> 53:       1156.692 cents   B#(  C((<br/> 54:       1178.346 cents   B#   C(<br/> 55:       1200.000 cents   C</p><p>However, the transition from one notation to another will be pretty rough<br/>due to these fifths that border perceptual insanity:</p><p>692.932 cents<br/>701.955 cents<br/>714.586 cents</p><p>Still, one may think of 55 MOS as 55tET and thus calibrate the pitches and<br/>carry the leftover 30.677 cent comma to any degree for correct scale<br/>transpositions.</p><p>Of course I realize that 55 and 79 MOS are well-temperaments where scale<br/>transpositions won&iuml;&iquest;&half;t be exact at certain degrees given their static<br/>irregular nature, and in notation these will accumulate to become a<br/>nuisance. But no equal temperament less than 120 would do and those are<br/>simply too voluminous for practical usage. What I have in mind is a dynamic,<br/>flexible MOS.</p><p>When I spoke of my desire to modulate freely, I did not mean an exact<br/>transposition, but a fairly accurate transposition. 7.5 cents error is<br/>thus acceptable for my tastes.</p><p>As for transposing through all of 159 tones, it was Gene&iuml;&iquest;&half;s idea of<br/>dismissing 79 in favor of the monster. By no means do I desire to think of<br/>79 as a MOS out of 159 tET, but a distinct temperament in its own right.</p><p>I require to transpose the Maqamat through 17 traditional pitches that are<br/>more or less defined within 19tET. Trust me, 79 barely suffices and I am<br/>pushing the limit in Qanun construction with my selection.</p><p>31 tones are just too many starting points for the Maqamat, the same goes<br/>for 38. The reason I need as many tones as 79 arises from the fusion of<br/>Usshaq, Saba, Huzzam, Segah and Suz-I Dilara over 17 traditional pitch<br/>clusters. I need a 43tET kind of notation, and I would love to hear how you<br/>would employ diacritical marks to indicate the step numbers in such a case.</p><p>I like your revision of 53tET to mean 53 pitch clusters, which in effect is<br/>159tET yet again, and the standart mapping would lead to Suz-i Dilara, not<br/>Rast. For Rast, you would need F C G D A&lt; E&lt;&lt; B&lt;&lt;, which is not acceptable<br/>at all. But I assume you would use all-naturals for those pitches even<br/>though we are sticking to the 53 comma per octave argument that is<br/>inevitably Pythagorean in nature. If the concern is the preservation of the<br/>9-comma dichotomy, why not 55 MOS then?</p><p>Yes, I have observed myself that a chain of meantone fifths (92deg159) in<br/>159 completes a cycle, and I observe with satisfaction that you have<br/>proposed a shrewd notational scheme that only requires the Tartini symbols.<br/>However, the usage of Tartini symbols in 38 is all wrong. Please consider a<br/>43 notation like this:</p><p>C C+ C++ C# Db Db/ Dd D</p><p>Yes, I concur that ease of transposition is highly important to consider,<br/>but it cannot usurp the throne of Rast, which MUST be notated as a natural C<br/>Major scale without any accidentals whatsoever.</p><p>If we are searching for an equal temperament without making any regrettable<br/>sacrifices as Gene also pointed out, then the correct choice is obviously<br/>E165A (55*3). Now only if we could notate this as 55tET, all our problems<br/>will be solved.</p><p>Your excellent contribution to Maqam Music is very much appreciated dear<br/>George.

Now<br/>that would lead to a historically sound proposition. However, you cannot use<br/>55ET for the Qanuns, Tanburs, and other fretted Maqam Music instruments<br/>unless you have the ability to move the frets. The Qanuns, due to their<br/>static construction, are out of the league, and require either the 79 MOS<br/>suggested, or its siblings 55 and 67 to be implemented.</p><p>I don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t know why some members react unfavorably towards 79, when obviously<br/>it is the upper limit to optimally conflated practical temperaments compared<br/>to such monsters as 159. The fact that most think the idea of making the<br/>Tanbur frets immovable ought to be the last thing that should be done shows<br/>the impossibility of expressing centenary tunings on the neck of string<br/>instruments. The Qanun is the clear exception to this case and I have<br/>every intention of exploiting this provision.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>Here is my response to Gene and co:</p><p>I think I answered most of your questions in my replies to George and Yahya.<br/>I am displeased that you disregard 79MOS because of a maximum of 7.5 cents<br/>error. You also forget that this is only meant for the Qanuns. What would<br/>you propose then?</p><p>For a complete catalog of Maqam scales in JI terms, you should wait for my<br/>doctorate thesis. There, I will attempt to show that the old &grave;phenomenal&grave;<br/>theorists (despite their respectable contributions) did not always propose<br/>or concern themselves with the correct solutions to Maqam Music Theory, and<br/>their purpose was more of glorifying a timeless past and a biased<br/>pre-disposition than actually measuring the pitches used. The notation issue<br/>is equally messed up. Utilizing these sources as a means to justify the<br/>Arel-Ezgi theory falls short of actual practice. It was afterall Farabi&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>dictum that:</p><p>&grave;If the proposals made by theorists contradict the actual practice of<br/>performers, the mistaken party are the theorists, not the practitioners.&grave;</p><p>Sadly, some members choose to follow the lead of the mistaken theorists<br/>rather than renown practitioners. Really, people who have never in their<br/>life measured the frequencies of a musical genre they analyze are entitled<br/>to total oblivion. Now, that and copy-pasting those like Signell who made<br/>little or no contribution to actual pitch measurements in Maqam Music is<br/>truly uninspiring. Even worse is the case where, the screeching desire by<br/>performers to abandon the established &grave;thousand-year old theory&grave; known to us<br/>all in favor of &grave;haphazard fretting&grave;, is interpreted as a gesture of<br/>&grave;musical expression&grave;.</p><p>My senior colleague *Jon* Akkoc&iuml;&iquest;&half;s research cannot be dismissed blatently, or<br/>brushed aside in wanton burlesque. He is right in saying that the works of<br/>such great masters as Farabi, Safiyuddin and co were probably based on &iuml;&iquest;&half;ad<br/>hoc meditations.&iuml;&iquest;&half; Hoping that he won&iuml;&iquest;&half;t be upset with me for quoting him,<br/>here is what he says:</p><p>&quot;I can never forget a comment made by a Western musicologist (forgot his<br/>name though  ) trying to solve the *mystery* of sounds and tuning systems<br/>used in Indian music. After watching the pitches used by master musicians on<br/>a computer screen during a live performance, he says something to the<br/>effect, *they were not even using the pitches they said they were using*.</p><p>Tanbur might be a very difficult instrument for Turkish music because of its<br/>frets, moveable or not. I would not go to the bank with what has been placed<br/>in books, the internet, and otherwise in the way of *standard* tuning,<br/>regardless of the signature underneath.&quot;</p><p>Here is what Carl says regarding this matter, which I hope is not intrusive<br/>on my part to post here:</p><p>&grave;A working intonation theory for non-fixed-pitch instruments simply<br/>doesn&apos;t exist, and would have been virtually impossible to create it<br/>before the advent of digital measurement tools.</p><p>Even for fixed pitch instruments limited (mainly) to the Western<br/>tradition, only in the last 10 years, on the tuning and tuning-math<br/>lists, has a satisfactory explanation of intonation come to light.&grave;</p><p>Which brings me to Kraig&iuml;&iquest;&half;s words:</p><p>&grave; While i think that Ozan is probably correct in in stating that 53<br/>cannot accommodate a description of this music , i find the idea of a 79<br/>subset of 159 really out in left field and lacks a real continuity with its<br/>own <a href="http://history.one">history.one</a> option is that one is dealing with a movable 53 tone system<br/>which is almost impossible to measure, due to variation being due to the<br/>context in which certain things are played.the concept is not so different<br/>that 12 ET where the intonation varies in much the same degree as the charts<br/>your painstaking analysis shows with this music.</p><p>I believe one of the best methods would be to have an instrument where the<br/>players could pick out the intervals one at a time and adjust them to what<br/>they hear, as what someone plays is not always what one would play given<br/>enough time to play it without the limitations of the instruments. I think<br/>that boomlitter and creel have a method that would apply well to examining<br/>this music.&grave;</p><p>My response to this would be that we have already done such measurements.<br/>Even without them, I could tell which pitches the seyir of a particular<br/>maqam demands. My ongoing experiments with the midi equipment at my disposal<br/>clearly tells me that the &grave;thousand year old theory&grave; is wrong, terribly<br/>wrong, both in pitch measurement, and in notation. This is why Maqam Music<br/>is stuck in historical platitudes and thus, cannot progress.</p><p>Kraig also says:</p><p>&grave;There also appears to be that there is much concern within your<br/>group of Turkish musician to preserve a particular school or tradition.<br/>It is quite hard to get a sense of the limits and range of interest as<br/>to what it differentiates itself from and for what reasons, which might<br/>be useful in understanding all the dynamics that are going on.<br/>There are always rival schools and it it is important to understand how they<br/>manifest and interact with each other. While there are names here we<br/>associate with turkish music, these people seem to be possibly unknown to<br/>Ozan for example, and i for one would like to understand, how such things<br/>happen.&grave;</p><p>The reference was to Talip Ozkan, who is known around here as a folk artist,<br/>with possible interest in Maqam Music. More prominent examples include<br/>Tanburi Djemil, Erjumend Batanay and Nedjdet Yashar, who should obviously be<br/>taken as basis when investigating authentic Maqam Music performance. In<br/>fact, it is said that the current Tanbur style of playing is owing to<br/>Tanburi Djemil himself, since all other styles are practically lost to us.</p><p>It is a wonder, how a Fasil music incorporating Violins, Kemenchas, Ouds and<br/>Tanburs can handle different tuning systems when they are performing in<br/>unison! Equally baffling is how 5/4 and 8192/6561 can be considered to be<br/>identical when even Rauf Yekta complains that 5/4 is used instead of the<br/>3-limit pythagorean diminished fourth by the practitioners of his era.</p><p>The pitches given in this address<br/><a href="http://www.turkmusikisi.com/calgilar/tanbur/tanbur.htm">http://www.turkmusikisi.com/calgilar/tanbur/tanbur.htm</a> clearly contradict<br/>the fret system of the tanbur picture seen on the same page.

I&iuml;&iquest;&half;m afraid a dissertation matching your request does not exist<br/>as yet, and may be available if I can ever get to write my doctorate thesis<br/>on Maqam Music Theory in English. For starters, let me tell you that you<br/>have selected the right instrument by studying the Ney. All the pitches<br/>found in almost every corner of the Middle-East can be produced by this<br/>crude reed-flute. Surprisingly enough, so little study is made on it, and<br/>its construction is still largely a mystery. Apparently, tradition overrides<br/>research and development when Ney is in question.</p><p>There are 9 basic Ney Ahengs in Maqam Music Theory:</p><p>Bolahenk {Nisfiye} (means half, the octave of tanbur tuning), Rast=D4<br/>Sip-Bol Mabeyn (means middle, half-tone)<br/>Sipurde, Rast=C4<br/>Mustahzen, Rast=B3<br/>Kiz-Mus Mabeyn<br/>Kiz, Rast=A3<br/>Man-Kiz Mabeyn<br/>Mansur, Rast=G3<br/>Shah-Man Mabeyn<br/>Shah, Rast=F3<br/>Davud, Rast=E3</p><p>Anything beyond Davud is impossible to play due to enormous sizes. Even Shah<br/>is challenging for most people.</p><p>For construction details, you may want to obtain Suleyman Ergunet&iuml;&iquest;&half;s book<br/>titled &iuml;&iquest;&half;Ney-Metod&iuml;&iquest;&half;. Let me know if you can&iuml;&iquest;&half;t find it.</p><p>Dervish is my cousin, not nephew as I wrongly referred the first time. As I<br/>said, that would make me look old! ;) If it will interest you, I tend to<br/>play the Ney a little and can give you some tips later on. For starters, you<br/>should know that Maqam Music pitches are relative frequency clusters, not<br/>absolute frequencies as wrongly expressed by most. Think of them as<br/>diatonical degrees for building Maqam scales.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div>
