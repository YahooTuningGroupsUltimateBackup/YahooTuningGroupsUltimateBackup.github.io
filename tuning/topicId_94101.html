It&apos;s a very simple bearing plan, too- four pure fifths octave reduced. My point is that when we look at the allegedly complex intervals of medieval and ancient theorists, we often find that what might appear to be extravagantly complex figures are upon closer inspection quite simple in terms of &quot;real life&quot;.

Or maybe both, maybe users who want to be identified can use the non secret version of the poll.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or - maybe should have a separate poll for people who think they can distinguish the intervals and for those who think they can&apos;t after listening to the training clips. Because if you don&apos;t think you can hear any difference, your results may be close to random - which may skew the poll and hide the signal you are looking for from people who feel they can distinguish them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or something, needs some thought. I&apos;ve got to get back to other things, getting a bit distracted (though fascinated) by all this, so I think I&apos;ll leave it a day or two and do it maybe towards end of the week or early next week.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The intervals are so close together that it could be quite a challenge to answer the question &quot;which is pitched between the other two&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So anyway perhaps can&apos;t do a perfect test but at least do my best to set up the situation so that it is highly likely near to 100% that musicians will do the identification by listening to the texture or beat patterns etc. of the dyads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for cheating - well I think I&apos;ll just say that if you have any way of distinguishing them by analysis, please don&apos;t use them, so we can do it properly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could probably distinguish them using Tune Smithy&apos;s various frequency analysis tools - though they are quite hard to use at present in version 3.1, and distinguishing the 81/64 from the 408.0 is likely to push the limits of sensitivity of most ways of attempting to measure the interval (I think FTS could probably do it if the clip is long enough).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll make the clips quite long like say 30 seconds or a minute each, because you may need to listen to it for a while, as you listen to a long held dyad more details in the texture and pattern of the beating partials etc. may become apparent. Which is also realistic as when tuning then you can play both notes for as long as is required to complete the tuning to the desired level of accuracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Great!

And see if you think you can distinguish them.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then add a duplicate of one of the files, not say which, and add an extra clip which will be either 406.0 or 409.0 and again, not say which it is.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then label those in random order as say A B C D E and then the challenge is to identify the 81/64 and optionally to try to get the 407.0, the 408.0 too. And to find  out which of the remaining ones is the duplicate, what it is duplicate of, and which is the extra one, and for a bonus &quot;star&quot; is the extra one 406.0 or 409.0. Just for fun, see if anyone gets them all right, and see how many get the 81/64.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It will have to be the sort of poll where you don&apos;t see the results until everyone has voted. Which I see is an option here. Also - I wonder if I should display users&apos;s identities for the poll results or make it a secret one? Or maybe both, maybe users who want to be identified can use the non secret version of the poll.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or - maybe should have a separate poll for people who think they can distinguish the intervals and for those who think they can&apos;t after listening to the training clips. Because if you don&apos;t think you can hear any difference, your results may be close to random - which may skew the poll and hide the signal you are looking for from people who feel they can distinguish them.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or something, needs some thought. I&apos;ve got to get back to other things, getting a bit distracted (though fascinated) by all this, so I think I&apos;ll leave it a day or two and do it maybe towards end of the week or early next week.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The intervals are so close together that it could be quite a challenge to answer the question &quot;which is pitched between the other two&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway perhaps can&apos;t do a perfect test but at least do my best to set up the situation so that it is highly likely near to 100% that musicians will do the identification by listening to the texture or beat patterns etc. of the dyads.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; As for cheating - well I think I&apos;ll just say that if you have any way of distinguishing them by analysis, please don&apos;t use them, so we can do it properly.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You could probably distinguish them using Tune Smithy&apos;s various frequency analysis tools - though they are quite hard to use at present in version 3.1, and distinguishing the 81/64 from the 408.0 is likely to push the limits of sensitivity of most ways of attempting to measure the interval (I think FTS could probably do it if the clip is long enough).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll make the clips quite long like say 30 seconds or a minute each, because you may need to listen to it for a while, as you listen to a long held dyad more details in the texture and pattern of the beating partials etc. may become apparent. Which is also realistic as when tuning then you can play both notes for as long as is required to complete the tuning to the desired level of accuracy.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Robert<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great!

It&apos;s a very simple bearing plan, too- four pure fifths octave reduced. My point is that when we look at the allegedly complex intervals of medieval and ancient theorists, we often find that what might appear to be extravagantly complex figures are upon closer inspection quite simple in terms of &quot;real life&quot;.

I&apos;ve even noticed people who name-call in this group do not do so in<br/>other groups, namely on the grounds of &quot;I&apos;m smarter than you, so be a good group<br/>member and be quiet while the &apos;real experts&apos; speak&quot;.<br/>    Why?  It almost seems as if flaming has become a mark of experteeism over<br/>here and the flamers often pose themselves as &quot;cleaning the idiots off the<br/>list&quot;.   However the people flamed and often eventually thrown out, oddly<br/>enough, often establish on other groups that they are from from the &quot;idiots&quot;<br/>they were portrayed as on the Tuning list.  Either way, call it &quot;good group<br/>intellectual standards&quot; or what ever you want, but it seems clear to me what<br/>such actions do: they make the tuning list, moreover anything or anyone else,<br/>just plain old look bad, confused, and sometimes downright dishonest.</p><p>   I think what Cameron is trying to do with the wild Maqam thread is admirable:<br/>say that a scale&apos;s &quot;ethnic&quot; validity can be fairly clearly based on if it<br/>contains certain intervals important in a culture.  People can say they disagree<br/>with the goal...but at least they should be able to admit &quot;even if I don&apos;t agree<br/>with the goal, I agree said method does a good/bad job of acheiving said goal&quot;<br/>by simply stating how many dyads are captured well.  This gets a bit flaky with<br/>things like consonance where everyone has a certain degree of subjective opinion<br/>(especially with regards to 7+ odd limit ratios and chords).    But, even in<br/>those cases, I think one good &quot;non-debatable&quot; comparison point option is to say<br/>&quot;this scale is created with the goal of getting as many dyads within the set of<br/>*list of dyads*...how well do you think it conforms?&quot;.
