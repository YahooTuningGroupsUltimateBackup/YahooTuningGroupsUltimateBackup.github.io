This is very clear and for me has no<br/>relation in my experience to the general class of phenomena that I think can<br/>be called &quot;resultant tones&quot; which certainly includes difference tones and<br/>sum tones (and presumably *not* virtual pitch--or am I wrong?).</p><p>&gt; As described in The Just Intonation Primer, this observation<br/>&gt; cannot be explained by difference tones, as it happens even<br/>&gt; if you:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () Do things at very low volumes, where difference tones<br/>&gt; are insignificant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () Present the stimuli binaurally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; () Put a bunch of noise in the signal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In music, there is a notion of &quot;root&quot;.

More could be found out<br/>perhaps by using pure tones and seeing how far pitches can be altered from<br/>just before the sense of rootedness is lost.
