It<br/>appears that this is a case number,not a serial number.<br/>   Due to a rebuild at some time in the past, there are not factory serial<br/>numbers on it, but a penciled in 80050/ 1916 on the inside of the action<br/>cavity.  I am leaning toward telling her to believe that later date, due to<br/>the piano&apos;s construction.  I also told her I would bounce this out on the<br/>list to see if I could find somebody to agree with me.<br/>    The piano is a conventional grand, about 6 feet.  It has a continuous<br/>rim, full iron plate, modern action and damper assembly.  Mahogany case,  88<br/>keys, normal keypins, etc.<br/>   Is there any particular facet of the Knabe pianos that marks a particular<br/>date?  Like partial plates at such and such a time, or jointed rims<br/>discontinued at a particular date?  Help please,  she thinks the museum will<br/>want it very badly........<br/>Thanks,<br/>Ed Foote RPT</p></div><h3><a id=17957 href="#17957">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2001 9:15:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Ed;</p><p>So it&apos;s tuned in an antique manner?</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with real antique Knabes, though we&apos;ve an 1880&apos;s grand<br/>in the other shop. This has three bridges, and two overstringing planes<br/>- the third bridge cantilevers off the back of the tenor. Angled tail,<br/>non-continuous rim and with the soundboard grain about 65-70&iuml;&iquest;&half; to the<br/>belly rail. Herz/Erard action with crow-feets, glued-on damper flanges.<br/>Open face block, angled with struts going across, big old stretcher in<br/>the treble.</p><p>If the Balmo makers were like Boston ones in the &apos;50s most likely it<br/>would be straight strung, probably with octagonal legs and Rosewood<br/>veneer. Don&apos;t know about actions, could be single, double or a spindly<br/>H/E.</p><p>Try posting to pianotech, though...</p><p>Clark</p></div>
