Since 88/1200 = 11/150,<br/>we see that it has exactly 150 steps in the span of 11 octaves. There is<br/>no &quot;octave&quot;, we have to replace it with<br/>2**11 = 2048. The 11-limit pitch factors (the H vector) become (log2048,<br/>log3, log5, log7, log11)<br/>the factors of the pitch vectors -- which normally is (2,3,5,7,11) -- to<br/>(2048,3,5,7,11).</p><p>The following matrix has a determinant of 150:</p><p>+0001 000 00 0 00 : repetition after 11 octaves<br/>-4/11 +04 +1 0 00 : syntonic comma<br/>-5/11 -11 00 8 00 : 5 subminor thirds = 3 supramajor thirds<br/>00000 -05 +1 2 00 : 9/7 * 9/7 ~= 5/3   comma=245/243<br/>-0004 +07 -1 2 -3 : 3 neutral thirds ~= 7/4 * 21/20</p><p>Maybe there is a way to fit the ratio 243/242 in the matrix.
