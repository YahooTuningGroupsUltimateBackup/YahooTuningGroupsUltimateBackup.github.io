Understanding that each<br/>viewpoint is valid, and that they sometimes coincide and<br/>sometimes differ in their conclusions, is very important on all<br/>sides.</p><p>For this gentle region, I do think that the terms &quot;pele-compatible&quot;<br/>and &quot;leapday-compatible&quot; can do wonders. They are culturally<br/>neutral, and describe what is there while letting the designer<br/>of a tuning system define what the musical ethos or intent is.<br/>Of course, if a designer chooses or accepts the pele or leapday<br/>label, then that resolves the question of intent.</p><p>And I&apos;d say that the GNU Public License or equivalent pretty much<br/>implicitly applies: &quot;Margo designed MET-24 for things other than<br/>intentional 5-limit thirds, but I love the pele-compatiblity<br/>so much that I&apos;ve gone and expanded it to a MET-34 which I&apos;m<br/>using for unabashed pele!&quot;</p><p>&gt;  11/10: 703.500</p><p>Indeed, and this interval depends only on the size of the linear<br/>generator, with 10 generators down producing 11/10.</p><p>Note that MET-24 is tempered about 0.21 cents higher, where 11/10<br/>is about 2.1 cents narrow -- roughly the same amount as 14/13.</p><p>&gt;  10/9, 13/10: 703.522</p><p>Again, MET-24 is a bit high for these, and has the real<br/>limitation that 13/10 or the like doesn&apos;t come up, with 352/273<br/>as the closest approach (not very close!).</p><p>&gt;  8/7: 703.579</p><p>This is George Secor&apos;s generator, and one of his eigenmonzos, in<br/>the HTT family. So it looks like we&apos;re agreed!</p><p>&gt;  11/9, 13/11: 703.597</p><p>Yes, this is the tiny difference between Secor&apos;s (504/13)^(1/9) and<br/>(44/13)^(1/3). In George&apos;s view, a very minute detuning of 13/11<br/>and 11/9 might actually be a virtue.</p><p>&gt;  7/6: 703.782</p><p>This one is interesting. I must admit that my immediate reaction<br/>was: &quot;Isn&apos;t this a bit low to use a pure 7/6 rather than 7/4 as<br/>the basis for the spacing?&quot; It&apos;s a matter of taste, but<br/>explaining my reaction might help for you or others trying to<br/>understand my optimization philosophy or mindset.</p><p>The complication for me is the effect that such a large spacing<br/>has on things like 13/12, 12/11, and especially 11/8, 13/8, and<br/>21/16, by comparison with MET-24. That isn&apos;t saying by any means<br/>that this optimization is wrong, only that it is a somewhat<br/>different shading than MET-24. And if we&apos;re aiming for or<br/>especially welcome a 64/59, a la Safi al-Din al-Urmawi, this<br/>might be just about ideal. It&apos;s actually hard to go wrong in<br/>this part of the spectrum -- as might also be said for just<br/>about anywhere else!</p><p>But on the compromises, one good test is to look at 4:6:7:9:11:13,<br/>where 11/8 at 4.207 cents wide does stand out a bit.</p><p>&gt;  9/7, 14/13: 704.043</p><p>Certainly we both see 14/13 as a vitally important point, and<br/>here I would make 7/6 an eigenmonzo, where the consequences for<br/>13/8 are more favorable than at 703.782 cents, because the<br/>regular minor sixth is more like an 11/7. Around MET-24 or<br/>a bit above, it&apos;s actually a slightly better 52/33, with<br/>not so much of a distance to 13/8; so going for a just 7/4 treats<br/>13/8 with a softer touch.</p><p>&gt;  14/11: 704.377</p><p>Naturally: this stands out just like 1/4-comma meantone. And<br/>George Secor used it in 1978 for the remote eight fifths of his<br/>17-tone well-temperament; it wasn&apos;t until 2000 that I got into<br/>the act, and then learned the next year that his 17-WT<br/>definitely had precedence.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
