Anyone have a reference? If it&apos;s true, I think Monz should add 1/2-comma meantone to his table and chart on his meantone definition page. In certain well-temperaments like Kirnberger II, certain fifths are tempered by 1/2-comma.</p><p>1/2-comma meantone:<br/>fifth: 691.20&#xFFFD;<br/>major third: 364.81&#xFFFD;<br/>minor third: 326.39&#xFFFD;</p><p>9:5 is Just in 1/2-comma meantone, and so is 10:9 -- so it delimits the ultimate extreme on the &quot;flat&quot; end of the meantone range, just as Pythagorean (which is in Monz&apos;s table) form the ultimate extreme on the &quot;sharp&quot; end (all this assumes you take &quot;mean-tone&quot; literally).</p></div>
