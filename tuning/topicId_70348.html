It&apos;s interesting, I just downloaded the demo!  I&apos;ve not tried it yet.  The limit of 30 pitches to the octave is fine by me for now.</p><p>Does it also allow importing of soundfonts, or just the ones that come with the program (and extra CD)?</p><p>Thank you VERY much for your suggestion -- it must have got to me before the email (cue weird music).</p><p>I will also check out your site.  Thanks for the link.</p><p>All best wishes,<br/>Gordon</p><p>PS Eventually, I&apos;d like to try hearing what scale Arthur Fickenscher really had in mind for his Polytone.  That&apos;s got more than 30 notes to the octave...</p><p>On 6-Mar-07, at 5:26 PM, J.Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gordon, I hear your plea -- not to mention, feel your pain.
