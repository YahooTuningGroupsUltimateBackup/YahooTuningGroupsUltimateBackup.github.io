It would be churlish of<br/>me to call the real Mercedes old fashioned and say that the car that I was<br/>selling was better. It would probably be more effective if I was to say that<br/>&quot;the Mercedes is an excellent car you should go check it out.

I just think that it is more responsible to use<br/>these words in reference to tuning systems you yourself have created rather than<br/>bagging tunings that you don&apos;t prefer [especially when a term like &quot;boring&quot;<br/>doesn&apos;t mean alot out side of a musical context].</p><p>&lt;Or has peoples&apos; perception of my expertise stepped over some line,<br/>such that I can&apos;t have (fallible) personal opinions any more, and must<br/>now spell this out every time?&gt;</p><p>Not at all Dave.

As I understand your<br/>philosophy, Justin, you&apos;re interested in a form of strict JI that<br/>Dave isn&apos;t even considering here. Sure, a microtempered guitar can<br/>easily play vertical JI chords in the hands of a skilled player. Even<br/>a 12-tET guitar can do that. But then we&apos;re dealing with adaptive JI<br/>(which I favor anyway), rather than strict JI, where _all_ the<br/>intervals, melodic and harmonic, are based on ratios. Justin, from<br/>your comments, I take it you&apos;re interested in strict JI -- yes?</p><p>(Sorry to stir up trouble Dave, just wanted all the cards to be on<br/>the table in this discussion).</p></div>
