Sorry for any redundancy...</p><p>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By now you should have taken delivery of one Joseph-Pehrson-special<br/>&gt; TrueType font containing sloping + and - signs. I hope you find them<br/>&gt; suitable. Let me know if you want them changed in some way.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***These symbols are absolutely *perfect* and I&apos;ll start using them<br/>right away.  I have no problems with them whatsoever!</p><p>&gt; I remembered how much you dislike the little Bosanquet slashes,</p><p>***Well, that was a bit of a &quot;knee jerk&quot; reaction.  I&apos;m trying to<br/>rethink *everything* now...</p><p>so I<br/>&gt; have made the otherwise horizontal strokes on the + and - much<br/>bigger<br/>&gt; and bolder than those, and sloped them at 45 degrees as recommended<br/>by<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***They look nice this way, in any case...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve called the font &quot;HEWM S&quot; where the &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;Sagittal<br/>&gt; compatible&quot; and I hope you will consider also using its version of<br/>the<br/>&gt; sixthtone half-arrows, so that although you are not using Sagittal,<br/>at<br/>&gt; least we don&apos;t have any clashes where the same symbol means<br/>different<br/>&gt; things in the two systems.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***This is not a problem at all.  I&apos;m making the switch immediately.</p><p>&gt; As George pointed out, such clashes are completely unavoidable<br/>between<br/>&gt; Sims and HEWM (or Sims and Sagittal), and having departed from the<br/>&gt; Sims twelfthtone and quartertone symbols there is no real reason to<br/>&gt; hold on to its sixthtone symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Placing the HEWM half arrowheads on the right makes them slightly<br/>more<br/>&gt; distinct from the sloping lines of the + and - symbols, and curving<br/>&gt; them (now more pronounced) makes them more distinct from the full<br/>&gt; arrows as well as the + and - symbols.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, are you going to use the HEWM plusses and minuses for the<br/>syntonic comma in Sagittal?  I rather wish you would.</p><p>In any case, this new font is just terrific, and I will begin using<br/>it immediately.  I am also delighted to learn that it is compatible<br/>with the Sagittal notation.  It&apos;s just great!</p><p>Thanks so much again!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2003 12:14:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Well, are you going to use the HEWM plusses and minuses for the<br/>&gt; syntonic comma in Sagittal?

In the mixed-symbol<br/>version,<br/>&gt; the conventional sharp and flat symbols are retained, and the two<br/>&gt; flags (elements 2 &amp; 3) are combined with an arrow shaft into a<br/>single<br/>&gt; symbol.  This is more cluttered than the pure version when notating<br/>&gt; chords, but at least it&apos;s manageable.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***My impression is that using the traditional symbols made it much<br/>more &quot;readable&quot; not more &quot;cluttered&quot; after looking at the graphic in<br/>the Tuning Math forum!</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s theoretically possible to retain the efficiency of the<br/>sagittal<br/>&gt; semantics and expand on the HEWM-S set by devising new symbols<br/>(very<br/>&gt; distinctly different from one another) for the 6 remaining sagittal<br/>&gt; flags, so that these could be combined by placing them beside each<br/>&gt; other to the left of a notehead, just as we combine numerals to<br/>make<br/>&gt; 2-digit numbers.  But this would be visually less efficient and<br/>would<br/>&gt; create more clutter than combining flags (or symbol-parts) into<br/>&gt; unified symbols (rather like trying to put cents numbers to the<br/>left<br/>&gt; of notes).  And besides, you would already have to make an<br/>exception<br/>&gt; for the 11-M-diesis symbol (quartertone arrow in 72-ET), because ^<br/>&gt; and v are already single symbols rather than a combination of + or -</p><p>&gt; and some sort of 55-comma symbol pair (whatever that might be).<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I would bet that the *combining* of symbols would work better than<br/>your &quot;simplification&quot; on the overall.  I would enjoy seeing examples<br/>of music using that alternative.

These<br/>are the pure Sagittal symbols that you judged to be completely out of<br/>the question as to usability, but I would like to point out something<br/>about them.  When I compare their general appearance to that of the<br/>numerals directly above them, I can&apos;t help noticing how much more<br/>they differ in appearance from each other than do some of the<br/>numerals from other numerals; for example, &quot;3&quot; and &quot;5&quot; look very much<br/>alike, as do &quot;6&quot; and &quot;8&quot; or &quot;8&quot; and &quot;9&quot;, and except for &quot;1&quot;, there is<br/>no clue from the physical appearance of any given numeral as to how<br/>many units it specifies (unlike the Sagittal symbols, which are<br/>constructed in a logical, orderly fashion).  If you presently used<br/>Roman numerals and Arabic numerals were something completely new to<br/>you, I imagine that you would immediately dismiss them as completely<br/>impractical, claiming that it would be next to impossible to read and<br/>distinguish them quickly and easily.  (Or if you were used to reading<br/>everything in UPPER CASE, might you dismiss lower case letters as<br/>impractical, since everyone would have to learn twice as many<br/>characters?)</p><p>Yet we use these every day without any problem -- we even know that<br/>characters that look as similar as a &quot;3&quot; and a &quot;5&quot; are<br/>distinguishable when reading *music* at high speed (as Johnny<br/>Reinhard would be the first to testify).  I enter this into evidence<br/>as &quot;Exhibit B&quot;.</p><p>3) I submit that the real question here is not whether the symbols<br/>are sufficiently different in appearance to be easily distinguished<br/>when read at high speed, but rather how many players will be willing<br/>to spend sufficient *time and effort* to learn what to look for in<br/>order to be able to read them quickly.</p><p>Please don&apos;t be too quick to answer that question before considering<br/>something that might put this in a different light.  Shortly after<br/>beginning my investigation into the possibilities offered by<br/>microtonality over 35 years ago I came to the conclusion that 72-ET<br/>was an excellent division (better in my estimation than 53-ET), but<br/>there was no question in my mind (even for many years thereafter)<br/>that 72-ET was *completely impractical* for acoustic instruments,<br/>believing anything beyond 31-ET to be beyond the upper limit of<br/>practicality.  I could not imagine that anyone would want to go to<br/>the trouble of mastering difficult pitch-bending techniques on<br/>existing wind instruments (when it would be so much easier to play<br/>instruments designed and built for new tunings), so I did not<br/>seriously consider that anything other than specially built or<br/>modified instruments could be practical for alternate tunings (hence<br/>the upper limit).  Yet it is being done today, simply because at<br/>present it is considered more practical to expend *time and effort*<br/>than *money*; but we can&apos;t assume that this will always be the case.</p><p>Joseph, you have to keep your mind open to various possibilities.<br/>Just because you don&apos;t think something is practical given *your<br/>present situation* doesn&apos;t mean that it won&apos;t *ever* be practical for<br/>*anyone else*.  Dave and I spent over a year and a half taking the<br/>development of the Sagittal notation through at least a half-dozen<br/>generations of development that, were it to occur by an evolutionary<br/>process involving actual microtonal practice, would probably require<br/>many centuries to arrive at (even taking into account the<br/>accelerating pace in which we regularly experience change due to<br/>advances in technology).  So our end product came about by a sort of<br/>engineered evolution, with advanced features and options to<br/>accommodate those who are way ahead of their time.  (So we can&apos;t<br/>blame you or anyone else for freaking out when exposed to the full<br/>set of what might be 28th-century musical symbols.)</p><p>We even think of the (temporarily named) &quot;HEWM-S&quot; font that you have<br/>decided to use as an evolutionary step in making a transition from<br/>Sims to Sagittal, so we&apos;re delighted about your decision.</p><p>&gt; I understand, though,<br/>&gt; you have to accomodate many different things and it may not be<br/>&gt; possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This sometimes leads me to the conclusion that possibly it&apos;s a self-<br/>&gt; defeating proposition to create a notation that *does everything.*<br/>&gt; Maybe that creates a &quot;forest for the trees&quot; syndrome where trying<br/>to<br/>&gt; shoehorn everything into a few similar-looking arrow-like symbols<br/>&gt; makes it a notation that is not truly functional and readable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only time will tell, but one thing is certain, and it&apos;s that a<br/>system<br/>&gt; that people *like* to play and use will survive in the long run...</p><p>Yes, time will tell -- and that applies not just to a notation, but<br/>even more so to the music that it represents.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2003 9:11:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

It&apos;s<br/>always thrown back that I&apos;m not *perceiving* this or that.</p><p>I can just say I wasn&apos;t satisfied with the original Sagittal set for<br/>72 and now I am with the &quot;adjusted&quot; HEWM-S.  That&apos;s because the<br/>symbols for the different commas necessary in 72 are sufficiently<br/>distinct.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re saying that there needs to be a difference in *shape* (which<br/>&gt; there is), but in your confusion you&apos;re completely ignoring both<br/>the shape (straight vs. curved) and direction (up vs. down) of the<br/>arrow  symbols.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***George, this is a bit silly.

If it looks clear and &quot;musicianly&quot; they will follow along.</p><p>If it doesn&apos;t, it will be like in Chorus Line... &quot;NEXT...&quot;</p><p>Believe me, there&apos;s lots of potential music to play out there!!!</p><p>&gt; Please don&apos;t be too quick to answer that question before<br/>considering<br/>&gt; something that might put this in a different light.  Shortly after<br/>&gt; beginning my investigation into the possibilities offered by<br/>&gt; microtonality over 35 years ago I came to the conclusion that 72-ET<br/>&gt; was an excellent division (better in my estimation than 53-ET), but<br/>&gt; there was no question in my mind (even for many years thereafter)<br/>&gt; that 72-ET was *completely impractical* for acoustic instruments,<br/>&gt; believing anything beyond 31-ET to be beyond the upper limit of<br/>&gt; practicality.  I could not imagine that anyone would want to go to<br/>&gt; the trouble of mastering difficult pitch-bending techniques on<br/>&gt; existing wind instruments (when it would be so much easier to play<br/>&gt; instruments designed and built for new tunings), so I did not<br/>&gt; seriously consider that anything other than specially built or<br/>&gt; modified instruments could be practical for alternate tunings<br/>(hence<br/>&gt; the upper limit).  Yet it is being done today, simply because at<br/>&gt; present it is considered more practical to expend *time and effort*<br/>&gt; than *money*; but we can&apos;t assume that this will always be the case.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, this assumption will be brought to the test when Johnny<br/>Reinhard presents my new woodwind quintet in Blackjack this year.</p><p>Bring your tuning meters!  (Just kidding, we wouldn&apos;t let you in in<br/>that case...)  :)</p><p>&gt; Joseph, you have to keep your mind open to various possibilities.<br/>&gt; Just because you don&apos;t think something is practical given *your<br/>&gt; present situation* doesn&apos;t mean that it won&apos;t *ever* be practical<br/>for<br/>&gt; *anyone else*.  Dave and I spent over a year and a half taking the<br/>&gt; development of the Sagittal notation through at least a half-dozen<br/>&gt; generations of development that, were it to occur by an<br/>evolutionary<br/>&gt; process involving actual microtonal practice, would probably<br/>require<br/>&gt; many centuries to arrive at (even taking into account the<br/>&gt; accelerating pace in which we regularly experience change due to<br/>&gt; advances in technology).  So our end product came about by a sort<br/>of<br/>&gt; engineered evolution, with advanced features and options to<br/>&gt; accommodate those who are way ahead of their time.  (So we can&apos;t<br/>&gt; blame you or anyone else for freaking out when exposed to the full<br/>&gt; set of what might be 28th-century musical symbols.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>***OK... So here is my *counter point* or *counterpoint!*:  I think<br/>your system would have been considerably stronger if it *HAD* gone<br/>through years of evolution.  I believe it is more a *theoretical*<br/>construct than a practical system, and I believe that the inventors<br/>are very &quot;hung up&quot; with the theoretical integrity of the system (like<br/>making it all work with just simple arrows...)</p><p>I mean this in a friendly way, just for the sake of debate.  But<br/>really, I think that *I* am really one of the first real<br/>intersections of Sagittal in the &quot;real world...&quot; and in a typical,<br/>lengthy musical evolution it would have been a much longer and more<br/>winnowing process.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that there aren&apos;t a lot of weird things in music that<br/>have come about through evolution.  Most of them, though, are pretty<br/>readily distinguishable... note values, key signatures... they&apos;re<br/>pretty easy to read and distinguish for the most part.... but, I<br/>admit, the system used to be *simpler...*</p><p>On the other hand, I greatly admire all the *thinking* that has gone<br/>into Sagittal and I hope to find time to read all the posts on Tuning<br/>Math, even though I only understand about 60% of them...  I&apos;m rather<br/>sorry I wasn&apos;t following along at the time...</p><p>&gt; We even think of the (temporarily named) &quot;HEWM-S&quot; font that you<br/>have decided to use as an evolutionary step in making a transition<br/>from Sims to Sagittal, so we&apos;re delighted about your decision.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>***Well, at least that&apos;s one thing we can all celebrate, so I don&apos;t<br/>think it&apos;s fair to accuse me of being &quot;inflexible...&quot;!  I&apos;ve entirely<br/>changed my own notations to correspond with Sagittal to a degree...<br/>although I&apos;m still questioning that you really have come to all the<br/>answers for such a comprehensive system.</p><p>It seems there are two opposing forces:  a comprehensive and<br/>streamlined system, as opposed to a distinguishable and easily<br/>recognizable system, that may have more flaws from either a<br/>conceptual or integral standpoint.</p><p>My opinion is that a system with more &quot;flaws&quot; might do the job<br/>better, so the question is how many can you tolerate and under what<br/>conditions...</p><p>Just some ideas here!</p><p>Thanks again and carry on...

It&apos;s just that we can&apos;t think of<br/>anything else that works. We&apos;re certainly open to suggestions. I<br/>spelled out the requirements some time ago, for a different symbol<br/>system that would preserve the semantics (the logic and consistency of<br/>the system):</p><p>At a minimum we need a set of 8 up/down-pairs of symbol-components<br/>that can be assembled, up to two at a time (same direction only), into<br/>symbols that clearly indicate their pitch direction, and are distinct<br/>from each other, and approximately indicate their pitch size (in JI),<br/>by the size of the symbol.</p><p>&gt; I feel my &quot;arguments&quot; are really not taken very seriously...</p><p>I think that&apos;s a bit unfair. I changed around 80 symbols in our<br/>TrueType font as a direct result of your testimony! The completion of<br/>the report was delayed by about 2 weeks while George used his spare<br/>time to update all the bitmap images in it!</p><p>I assume you put &quot;arguments&quot; in scare-quotes because they were mostly<br/>just statements of opinion rather than logical arguments based on<br/>accepted facts.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s<br/>&gt; always thrown back that I&apos;m not *perceiving* this or that.</p><p>Since it&apos;s so far mostly just you who&apos;s finding a problem (maybe<br/>that&apos;s &apos;cause so far you&apos;re the only one who&apos;s seriously considered<br/>using them), and since we&apos;re having trouble reconciling your various<br/>descriptions of the problem, and since we don&apos;t have any ideas to fix<br/>it so it would satisfy you, I hope you can understand why we are<br/>presenting arguments as to why there isn&apos;t any significant remaining<br/>problem (since we increased the curvature of the arcs).</p><p>I think George has an excellent point about how similar decimal digits<br/>are, and yet Johnny Reinhard finds that they work just fine as<br/>accidentals. And there may be up to _two_ of them _and_ a plus or<br/>minus sign _and_ a quartertone accidental, all against a single note!<br/>But by some miracle, people can read them at high speed.</p><p>Look at the digits 35689. They are incredibly similar! In most fonts<br/>they all basically consist of two elipses stacked on top of each<br/>other. The only difference between them is that some of the elipses<br/>have a tiny gap in them, on either the left or the right side, and in<br/>the case of the 5, the top elipse is squared up a bit, which is enough<br/>to distinguish it from a letter S.</p><p>This enormous similarity is exploited in the 7-segment displays one<br/>finds on digital watches and pocket calculators.</p><p>I submit that the digits 35689 are far more similar than the three<br/>kinds of arrowhead needed to notate 72-ET in sagittal. Imagine turning<br/>these digits thru 90 degrees clockwise and adding a vertical shaft<br/>from the middle, so they become downward arrows. I think all that is<br/>required is some time to _learn_ the new symbols and their meanings.</p><p>&gt; ***George, this is a bit silly.  Of course, there is a difference in<br/>&gt; *shape.*  But they&apos;re still ALL ARROWS and lots of them!  :)</p><p>But arrows are such wonderfully unambiguous indicators of direction.</p><p>You know what? I think standard music notation is totally unreadable!<br/>Never mind the accidentals. The notes are ALL ELIPSES and lots of<br/>them! Sure some are filled and some are open, and some have shafts<br/>with flags. Anyone can see that. But basically it&apos;s just a forest of<br/>elipses, all the same size and shape. How could anyone ever make sense<br/>of those at high speed? The performer&apos;s eyes will just glaze over. Why<br/>don&apos;t we use some different *shapes*? ;-)</p><p>Maybe the answer is: So that, if it&apos;s an elipse then you _know_ it&apos;s a<br/>pitched note with some duration, and not a rest or unpitched<br/>percussion, or any of the many other kinds of things indicated by<br/>symbols on a staff.</p><p>Similarly, maybe all the accidentals are arrows so that, if it&apos;s an<br/>arrow then you _know_ it&apos;s an accidental, not a grace note or special<br/>notehead or rest or ornament or articulation, or any of the many other<br/>kinds of things indicated by symbols on a staff.</p><p>&gt; Wouldn&apos;t it be better to combine some *other* shapes with them...</p><p>Maybe. So start suggesting some *other* shapes that will combine in a<br/>similar way to our various kinds of half-arrowhead while meeting the<br/>requirements described above. Although you probably should wait for<br/>the report before you start doing that.</p><p>&gt; but, alas, the project is too far in development and nobody wants<br/>&gt; to &quot;rethink&quot; it...</p><p>That simply isn&apos;t true. During the development so far, we&apos;ve many<br/>times thrown away things that we had worked weeks or months to<br/>perfect, as soon as anyone came up with a better idea.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 3) I submit that the real question here is not whether the symbols<br/>&gt; &gt; are sufficiently different in appearance to be easily distinguished<br/>&gt; &gt; when read at high speed, but rather how many players will be<br/>&gt; willing<br/>&gt; &gt; to spend sufficient *time and effort* to learn what to look for in<br/>&gt; &gt; order to be able to read them quickly.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Well, I would submit that the amount of time they will spend is<br/>&gt; directly proportional to the *logic* and *clarity* they see in the<br/>&gt; system.

I have to ask: A system with more<br/>flaws might do _what_ job better?</p><p>But before we start messing with the consistency of the system we<br/>would have to be really convinced that (a) no one could find a way to<br/>fix the problems by just changing the symbols, not the logic (as<br/>described above), and (b) that the existing symbols really are unusable.</p><p>And at this stage I don&apos;t have any kind of a handle on how we might<br/>make logical flaws work _for_ us.

Besides your desire for having<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; greater distinction between the 5-comma and 7-comma symbol pairs,<br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt; recognize that there is an additional advantage in this symbol<br/>set<br/>&gt; &gt; for those who presently read the Sims notation (and are<br/>considering<br/>&gt; &gt; an alternative), since they will not be confusing the Sims 7-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; &gt; symbol pair (which is virtually identical to the Sagittal 5-comma<br/>&gt; &gt; pair) with the Wilson 5-comma pair.  So we are *not* doing this<br/>&gt; &gt; *only* for the single reason that you brought up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Well, what was the &quot;single reason&quot; that I brought up?
