A modulation from C major to G major in 12-<br/>EDO is simply a transposition, the only differences are found in<br/>absolute pitches, tessitura, open/stopped strings, etc., ie.<br/>basically timbral.

Certainly many &quot;serial&quot; techniques predate both<br/>serialism and universal 12-EDO, coming from fugues and such, but I<br/>suspect that analyzing Scriabin as a hall of mirrors is more of a<br/>way to establish a particular compositional approach than a<br/>true &quot;key&quot; to his own approach. Which is okay- George Pearle&apos;s music<br/>is fine stuff.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=68257 href="#68257">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Flavell &#x3C;musictheorybill@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2006 8:11:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks very much for the response, Tom! :)</p><p>   I think this subject deserves a new thread, and I&apos;ll try and get<br/>one posted, if the moderator doesn&apos;t veto it! :)</p><p>   Bill Flavell</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Flavell&quot; &lt;musictheorybill@&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Historically, the main point of 12-EDO was unrestricted<br/>transposition,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which makes any point about inversion secondary.
