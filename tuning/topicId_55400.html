The only thing they give a table for is<br/>something you don&apos;t need a table for, namely how many cents make up<br/>the various 19-et intervals. Really, really sloppy; I know the<br/>scientific community often errs inn this department but here it is<br/>simply unacceptable in my opinion, since in this instance you cannot<br/>tell for certain which interval is even being talked about simply by<br/>eye. To my eye, for instance, it looks as if the 758 cent fifth is<br/>very consonant, and the meantone fifth highly dissonant. Not only does<br/>this result not seem credible, it contradicts what the authors say.<br/>Aside from the results allegedly presented in figure 1, which I am<br/>complaining of, figure 4 also presents results; these are more<br/>comprehensible since you can at least tell which interval is which,<br/>but a table would have been preferable. Moreover, the results I see do<br/>not always accord with what the authors say, so it&apos;s hard to say for<br/>sure what their data actually is.</p><p>From figure 4, the most consonant intervals were judged to be the<br/>fourth and fifth (sharp and flat as they are), then the minor third<br/>and major sixth (which in 19 are nearly pure, and this may explain why<br/>they outscore the major third.) After this so far as I can see is 9/5,<br/>but this contradicts the claim that neither of the two possible 7th<br/>partial approximations score well. *After* 9/5 and its inversion, the<br/>tone, if you believe the data alledgedly &quot;presented&quot; in this table,<br/>and assuming I am not looking at it cross-eyed, always a possibility,<br/>we finally get 5/4.</p><p>If you print it out figure 1 and use a ruler you can probably guess<br/>correctly what the interval supposedly being depicited actually is,<br/>and certainly can get a good idea of what the consonance measure is<br/>assuming your guess is right.</p><p>Shame on the referee for this paper! He could have and should have<br/>told the authors to tabulate some of this data.</p></div>
