My original intent was to work (or better, investigate how such work can be done - I am better an engineer than a musician) with any pitches that would be found as local minima in the dissonance function. It turned out that having some granularity would be beneficial to cut down computational complexity and also to control the drift; I think that 53-edo is a very good choice for that, mainly because it approximates just intervals very well, its step is fine, yet still large enough that it can be heard.</p><p>Since the dissonance is calculated from beats, the minima that occur in the dissonance function (I call it &quot;landscape&quot;, since it looks like one) are just intervals apart, that is the close ones are 17, 14, 9, 8, 5, and 3 steps. The &quot;landscape&quot; changes its shape as tones come in and out. 4-step interval also occurs (when I take my hands off and let algorithms run, like in &quot;Glockenspiel&quot;), but less frequently. The method seems to prefer either the diatonic or chromatic semitone (at least I believe that is what 5 and 3 steps in 53-edo correspond to).</p><p>Regards,<br/>Ian</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If you are intending to work with 53 edo you will find that you can<br/>&gt; map 53edo to a meantone-type note assignment with Large (L) and small<br/>&gt; (s) intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 53 edo would use:<br/>&gt; 9 steps to be the Large interval and<br/>&gt; 4 steps to be the small interval:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i.e. (9*5)  + ( 4*2) = 53 steps = 5L+2s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; see this page for details:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/equal_temp.html">http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/equal_temp.html</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2009 10:12:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;igb.33143&quot; &lt;ian.burleigh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have been working on a computer system for music sequencing<br/>&gt; using arbitrary frequencies that can be constrained to a<br/>&gt; discrete set, the 53-tone equal division in particular.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; To test the theory, I made a short experimental suite of<br/>&gt; pieces: variations on Bach&apos;s Prelude in C (WTC, BWV 846).<br/>&gt; The sound files and brief notes can be accessed here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://jbnotes.info/mt/Music/">http://jbnotes.info/mt/Music/</a><br/>&gt; I will greatly appreciate and reply to any comments that you<br/>&gt; can provide.

Your app is one of a few piano roll -style microtonal sequencers demonstrated recently, which is incredibly<br/>exciting for folks like me who have watched microtonal music<br/>slowly become more popular over the years.  And, who have been<br/>incredibly lazy, waiting for someone like you to create such a<br/>thing.  I presume you&apos;re familiar with the Rationale sequencer<br/>by Chuckk Hubbard?<br/><a href="http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/cgi-bin/rationaleinfo.py">http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/cgi-bin/rationaleinfo.py</a></p><p>It looks like yours is a Java application.  Have you thought<br/>about sharing it as an applet?</p><p>One question.  You say, &quot;can be constrained to any number<br/>of steps: namely twelve, forty eight, or fifty three&quot;.  Do<br/>you really mean any number of steps, or just 12, 48 and 53?</p><p>I really like what you&apos;re doing with your music.  I will point<br/>out something you probably already know -- that 53 is not the<br/>best choice for a lot of existing music, since it does not<br/>temper out the syntonic comma.  Something like 31 is about<br/>optimal among tunings that do (and its errors can in principle<br/>be corrected all the way to JI with a fairly straightforward<br/>&quot;adaptive tuning&quot; algorithm that inserts sub-step shifts).</p><p>I think realtime feedback for the composer about roughness<br/>(sensory dissonance) would be quite useful in exploring<br/>new tunings.  Normally the way I have thought about tunings<br/>is to first choose a set of chords I know are consonant<br/>(e.g. major and minor triads, etc) and then find scales that<br/>contain these chords aplenty (e.g. diatonic scale), and then<br/>to constrain the notation (piano roll, lines and spaces on a<br/>staff, etc.) to the steps of this scale.  Then the composer<br/>only needs to remember the scale step patterns of the chords<br/>(e.g. 1-3-5), and melodies appear linearly.  The missing<br/>notes to be accessed with accidentals or key signatures.<br/>In other words, a straightforward generalization of common-<br/>practice notation.</p><p>But I think the absolute pitch scale has value too, so I<br/>encourage your efforts fully (and indeed, would like to<br/>try an applet).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>igb.33143 &#x3C;ian.burleigh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2009 3:56:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks for posting.
