It has standard nominals, a standard way to assign<br/>accidentals, generalizes the two-staff bass/treble clef notation, has a<br/>standard way to standardize the range of each staff, and has a standard way<br/>to set the absolute pitch of the staves (and hence the whole tuning system).</p><p>My intention is for it to be a very broad and simple blueprint, used for<br/>one to get set up quickly in any arbitrary temperament and start<br/>communicating with other musicians. I previously wrote about this and<br/>called it the KISS notation system; this is hence KISS 2.0. The whole thing<br/>is very simple and works as follows, simplified to just use MOS&apos;s for now:</p><p>STAVES<br/>1) Pick an MOS that you want to be &quot;diatonic.&quot;<br/>2) Ensure that every staff covers at least an octave by giving each staff<br/>round(N/2+1) lines for an N-note scale.<br/>3) Standardize one ledger line below the treble clef to represent the same<br/>pitch as one ledger line above the bass clef; I&apos;ll call this pitch the<br/>&quot;Middle Note.&quot;</p><p>KEY SIGNATURES<br/>4) Pick a &quot;privileged mode&quot; of your scale.<br/>5) Set the key signature up so that your privileged mode, when the Middle<br/>Note is used as the tonic, is represented by the lines and spaces of the<br/>staff with no accidentals.</p><p>ABSOLUTE PITCH RANGE<br/>6) Standardize the tessitura of the entire notation system to be what it is<br/>now by setting the absolute pitch of the Middle Note to be 261.6 Hz.</p><p>NOMINALS<br/>7) Set the #/b accidentals to refer to the chroma L-s.<br/>8) Set the nominals for your scale up to be ascending numerals so that the<br/>middle note is nominal &quot;1.&quot;</p><p>And that&apos;s it. Some of it is so simple that it may not seem like it&apos;s worth<br/>writing about, but it&apos;s still probably good to write it explicitly<br/>somewhere.</p><p>This is not the end-all-be-all of notation. Depart from this and make your<br/>own tuning-specific tweaks to the notation if it serves you; use different<br/>accidentals for porcupine[7], or different nominals for meantone[7], or a<br/>different amount of lines if you think that 5 for meantone[7] is too many,<br/>or a different absolute pitch if you want your playing to be in tune with<br/>50 Hz electrical hum. I just hope that if you don&apos;t have strong feelings<br/>about one or more of those things, and want to just start talking about<br/>orwell[9] MODMOS&apos;s and writing music, for instance, this can serve as a<br/>reference for some sensible &quot;default&quot; parameters to pick.</p><p>There&apos;s probably a nice way to generalize alto, tenor, baritone, etc clefs<br/>as well, but as a pianist I never come in contact with those, so I&apos;m<br/>limiting my focus only to bass and treble clefs for now. I&apos;d be interested<br/>if people have thoughts about that, though.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105844 href="#105844">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2013 7:41:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A few afterthoughts about my rationale behind some of this stuff...</p><p>On Tue, Jan 22, 2013 at 3:59 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been working on a very simple, standardized notation scheme for any<br/>&gt; tuning system. It has standard nominals, a standard way to assign<br/>&gt; accidentals, generalizes the two-staff bass/treble clef notation, has a<br/>&gt; standard way to standardize the range of each staff, and has a standard way<br/>&gt; to set the absolute pitch of the staves (and hence the whole tuning system).</p><p>In general, I find that notation system design involves a lot of<br/>balancing between competing design constraints. For instance, as far<br/>as individual staves are concerned, we want to keep the whole thing as<br/>compact as possible, but contrarily, we also want to minimize the need<br/>to use ledger lines to avoid visual clutter. For the bass/treble staff<br/>split, our design goals are to cover a considerable amount of range<br/>with the two staves combined, but still also minimize the amount of<br/>ledger lines needed to play notes between the staves. Our existing<br/>notation system is one particular way to balance these competing<br/>constraints.</p><p>While there may be an argument to be made for overhauling our notation<br/>system in one way or another, for this particular notation, I sought<br/>when possible to satisfy these design constraints in a manner similar<br/>to how our existing notation system does it, since it&apos;s at least<br/>half-decent. The way I proposed setting the staves up thus generalizes<br/>what we have rather straightforwardly; you always end up with a ~3<br/>octave range with the two staves overlapping at the same spot as<br/>before, and even a 10 note diatonic scale requires only 6 lines per<br/>staff. I approached designing the rest of the system in much the same<br/>way.</p><p>One thing which was a bit less clear to work out was nominals. Our<br/>existing notation system has a pretty strange brew of nominals, which<br/>don&apos;t generalize to other tuning systems in a way that easily obeys<br/>existing convention. For instance, we use nominals A-G, but the note<br/>upon which the entire notation is symmetrically built around is<br/>assigned the name &quot;C&quot;. This note C isn&apos;t just the midpoint of the<br/>notation&apos;s range and the point about which the staves are symmetric,<br/>but it&apos;s also the tonic of C major, which for some reason has been<br/>standardized as having no sharps or flats.</p><p>If we were going to attempt to use letters as nominals for any<br/>arbitrary MOS, we might decide that the Middle Note is A, and things<br/>proceed from there. This is completely backwards-incompatible with<br/>what we have, though, as the old C becomes the new A, and the old C<br/>major is now the new A-C-E. We might decide to standardize the middle<br/>note as C instead, so that nominal name always start two before the<br/>Middle Note, but that&apos;s rather arbitrary, and any sort of cultural<br/>advantage of doing this goes straight out the window as soon as you<br/>start playing around in a decatonic scale or something like that.</p><p>I also found that using the letters that we already use in 12-EDO gets<br/>pretty damn confusing as soon as you use scales with more than 7<br/>notes, and especially once you get up to 10-note scales and the like.<br/>I talked to a few of my musician friends about this, and found that<br/>all but one had the same opinion as me on that. Letters require you to<br/>first unlearn, and then memorize a bunch of mathematical relationships<br/>that aren&apos;t at all immediately obvious - for instance, how many people<br/>really know what the 14th letter of the alphabet is, modulo the letter<br/>&quot;I&quot;, without internally translating into numbers first? Letters bring<br/>a lot of 12-EDO baggage that requires you to spend time unlearning<br/>things and adapting.</p><p>Numbers, on the other hand, are things we already know how to quickly<br/>reason with; they&apos;re fresh and intuitive. In blackwood[7]&apos;s LsLsLsLsLs<br/>mode, 1-4-7 is a major chord, which makes it immediately obvious<br/>without any need to learn anything else that there are now two passing<br/>tones between the 1/1 and 5/4, and likewise between the 5/4 and 3/2.<br/>Likewise, 4/3 is now 1-5, which makes it obvious that there are now<br/>three passing notes between 1/1 and 4/3. It&apos;s very simple.</p><p>Another advantage to using numbers is that the resulting system has a<br/>bit of international usefulness to it. For instance, some cultures<br/>don&apos;t even use letters to begin with. If we want to use letters we can<br/>always extend past G, but someone who&apos;s familiar with fixed-do solfege<br/>has no obvious way of extending anything, so they&apos;d have to switch to<br/>something else anyway. Numbers exist in every language, and are also<br/>mathematically useful.</p><p>There&apos;s only one real downside to using numbers for note names, and<br/>that&apos;s that we sometimes already use numbers to denote relative<br/>chords. So for instance, consider that we&apos;re in ordinary meantone[7],<br/>but using nominals 1-7 for the LLsLLLs mode, with the bottom note<br/>being the old C. So if we&apos;re in the key of &quot;3 minor,&quot; aka E minor, I<br/>might tell you to go to the V chord. This doesn&apos;t mean to play a chord<br/>over the absolute pitch &quot;5&quot; in the system, but rather to go to the<br/>relative V chord of 3, which would have its tonic as 7. Then, over<br/>this V chord, I might tell you to play a fourth instead of the major<br/>third, making it a Vsus4 chord. However, when I say to play a fourth,<br/>I don&apos;t mean the absolute pitch &quot;4&quot;, but a perfect fourth over the V<br/>chord; since the V chord has 7 as its tonic, the fourth would be 3.</p><p>When speaking, it&apos;s easy to avoid some of that confusion by using<br/>ordinal numbers to refer to chord extensions, e.g. &quot;fourth&quot; or<br/>&quot;ninth&quot;, and being explicit when you use cardinal numbers as to what<br/>sense you mean. It shouldn&apos;t be too difficult to figure out what &quot;the<br/>note 4&quot; vs &quot;the IV chord&quot; refers to if you speak it. And when writing<br/>stuff out, it&apos;s even easier to avoid if you always write relative<br/>chords in Roman numerals, as we already do, and write absolute pitches<br/>in Arabic numerals. However, this is the tradeoff for using numbers;<br/>they now have to mean both relative and absolute pitches.</p><p>I still think that, all things considered, numbers are better than<br/>letters. For me, using letters A-G is a total dealbreaker. If the<br/>above downside to numbers is enough for you to not want to use them,<br/>another option would be to use nonstandard letters starting with I, or<br/>to use the Greek alphabet, etc. I think that nonstandard letters are<br/>less easily to reason with mathematically and require more learning,<br/>and that this is worse than having to be a bit more explicit when<br/>talking about numbers, and likewise with the unfamiliarity of the<br/>Greek alphabet to most musicians. Feel free to give your thoughts<br/>though.</p><p>Lastly, I want to note that while I tailored this post to MOS, this<br/>same notation system easily also applies to higher-rank Fokker blocks<br/>as well, or really any epimorphic scale if you want. The only thing<br/>that needs to change to use these is to define more accidentals than<br/>just #/b; for Fokker blocks, one should be defined for each chroma in<br/>the block. I&apos;m very interested to see if this can be tied in with<br/>Sagittal notation by using as a base scale an 11-limit 7-note Fokker<br/>block which is a chain of seven 3/2&apos;s.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105845 href="#105845">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2013 11:23:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is all now so long that nobody will ever read it, but since I&apos;m<br/>on a roll, I&apos;ll post it anyway, at least for future reference.

We ought to assume from the outset that<br/>register is important, and that composers pick the tessitura that they<br/>write things in for actual reasons, which could be compositional<br/>and/or psychoacoustic in nature.</p><p>Because of this, we want to ensure our 3-octave &quot;easy access&quot; range<br/>covers the portion of the frequency spectrum which is the most<br/>musically versatile and useful to write in, and which covers things<br/>like. For instance, we might assume that our notation wouldn&apos;t be as<br/>useful in capturing the registers that composers want to actually<br/>write in the most if the Middle Note were two octaves above middle C,<br/>or two octaves below. We can again assume that what we have now is<br/>near-optimal.</p><p>The easiest way to standardize the register is to pick a canonical<br/>note somewhere within the range of the notation, and assign it a<br/>standard reference pitch. While I tried to yield to existing<br/>convention as much as possible in this notation system, after some<br/>thought it&apos;s become clear that the the best option for arbitrary<br/>tunings is to standardize the Middle Note as 261.6 Hz, and to avoid<br/>having to pick a second note in the scale to take the role of &quot;A&quot; at<br/>440 Hz.</p><p>The main reason is that if we want to have to pick this second note,<br/>there&apos;s no clear way to do it. In 12-EDO, we can easily standardize<br/>the range of the notation system by specifying the pitch of any note<br/>at all, because we know exactly how all of the notes relate to one<br/>another, so we know how to set it up a priori so that the registers<br/>and the whole thing will work out the way that we want. We just pick<br/>some other note, in this case A, and set that to be some pitch, in<br/>this case 440 Hz, so that all of the registers work out the way we<br/>want. However, for an arbitrary tuning, we don&apos;t know what other notes<br/>will be in the scale, so some sort of generalized approach is<br/>necessary.</p><p>Once we start trying to figure out how to standardize this procedure,<br/>we quickly realize that doing so requires us to implicitly standardize<br/>the Middle Note at 261.6 Hz anyway. If we accept that we want the<br/>Middle Note as the tonic for our privileged mode of choice, and we<br/>want the whole range of the notation system to be as close to to what<br/>it is now as possible, then the only possible way to meet these<br/>constraints while standardizing *some other* pitch to 440 Hz is to<br/>find the note in the scale such that tuning it to 440 Hz sets the<br/>Middle Note as close to 261.6 Hz as possible. This already requires us<br/>to specify the ideal tuning for the Middle Note is &quot;as close to 261.6<br/>Hz as possible,&quot; explicitly using that numeric value in the standard<br/>anyway, but then add in an additional extraneous step where we<br/>identify another note first in a tuning-specific way, and then tune<br/>that note to 440 Hz.</p><p>Another important reason is that many of the advantages of going with<br/>a standardized C261.6 for notation, but a standardized A440 for<br/>tuning, are specific to 12-EDO and meantone, and may not apply to<br/>arbitrary tunings at all. For instance, one of the reasons for tuning<br/>things to &quot;A&quot; is that &quot;A &quot;is an open string for the entire string<br/>section. However, for an arbitrary tuning, we have no idea how the<br/>strings will tune at all, and we certainly don&apos;t want to attempt to<br/>decide that this point. Thus, even if we attempt to standardize some<br/>other reference note in the tuning we have no guarantee that our other<br/>reference note will actually be any easier to tune to than the Middle<br/>Note itself.</p><p>This suggests that to finding the optimal &quot;tuning note&quot; for an<br/>orchestra is a task with quite different considerations from what<br/>we&apos;re discussing here, and that it will likely need to be done on a<br/>temperament-by-temperament basis. The criteria that go into picking a<br/>nice pitch to coordinate between tunings, for ease of notation and<br/>pitch standardization, are not the same criteria that go into<br/>determining the pitch out of that same tuning system that&apos;s optimal<br/>for the orchestra to tune to. Standardizing the Middle Note is useful<br/>for notational purposes and simultaneously provides a pitch standard<br/>for tunings in general. Assuming we do want to set the overall tuning<br/>up so that the Middle Note is 261.6 Hz, the question of which note in<br/>the scale to pick to best tune the orchestra will have to be worked<br/>out based on things like what the open strings of the violins are<br/>tuned to.</p><p>Finally, I note that having &quot;middle C&quot; be the same for all tunings is<br/>something which may have significance for those with AP. I certainly<br/>have a clear intuitive preference for this pitch being common to all<br/>tunings rather than A440, because our key signatures and my entire way<br/>of thinking about music builds out from C as the center. An informal<br/>survey of APers from Facebook&apos;s &quot;Got Perfect Pitch&quot; group yielded many<br/>similar preferences, though I note this is all a purely anecdotal<br/>account.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105847 href="#105847">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2013 12:40:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What you have here is a &quot;diatonic notation&quot;, according to my classification here</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/notation/">http://lumma.org/music/theory/notation/</a></p><p>I don&apos;t insist on the nominals being MOS, though maybe I should have.</p><p>-Carl</p><p> Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been working on a very simple, standardized notation<br/>&gt; scheme for any tuning system.</p><p>[snip]</p></div><h3><a id=105848 href="#105848">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2013 12:42:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In my examples, I use letters for nominals, but I can see<br/>the value of using numbers.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few afterthoughts about my rationale behind some of this stuff...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=105849 href="#105849">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2013 1:41:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This is all now so long that nobody will ever read it,<br/>&gt; but since I&apos;m on a roll, I&apos;ll post it anyway, at least<br/>&gt; for future reference.

The way I&apos;m doing it, any scale<br/>step pattern, like 1-3-5 or anything else, always has chords which<br/>look alike on the staff regardless of how consonant they are, just<br/>like the diatonic scale. So for instance if we&apos;re building the thing<br/>around 5-limit tetracot[7], and say our definition of consonance is<br/>&quot;5-odd-limit,&quot; then 1-3-5 doesn&apos;t have any consonant chords, but 1-3-5<br/>always looks the same on the staff.</p><p>I also note that if you use a rank-3 Fokker block to build the<br/>notation around instead of an MOS, you&apos;ll end up with one of your<br/>&quot;planar notations.&quot; Do you intend these categories to not be mutually<br/>exclusive? It seems like planar and linear notations could also be<br/>diatonic notations and vice versa.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105854 href="#105854">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2013 9:13:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jan 22, 2013 at 9:11 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there a KISS 1.0 by the way? -C.</p><p>Yes; it&apos;s mostly the same.

They&apos;re only diatonic if you happen to be using<br/>the scale they&apos;re based on. OK, Dave K. has said the Sagittal<br/>accidentals could be used with other nominal systems if desired.<br/>But I don&apos;t much like the Sagittal glyphs either. They&apos;re<br/>complex in order to enumerate a huge list of intervals.

I have to make a deliberate ongoing effort to keep the upper limit of each bucket consistent with the A=440 pitches, and I&apos;ve found that it helps a lot to play a keyboard (or other fixed-pitch instrument) on a regular basis to reinforce my AP reprogramming.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So there&apos;s hope, if you&apos;re willing to cope.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=105875 href="#105875">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2013 2:42:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Jan 24, 2013 at 1:11 PM, gdsecor &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m now 69, and I&apos;ve been experiencing this for the past several years.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s something like trying to identify colors when the ambient light is<br/>&gt; gradually shifting to a significantly different Kelvin (color) temperature,<br/>&gt; i.e., what&apos;s perceived as &quot;cooler&quot; vs. &quot;warmer&quot; lighting: is it a true<br/>&gt; yellow or yellow-orange?

When I play in<br/>a new tuning system, I notice that after a few days of constant<br/>immersion, it starts to really get into my head and mess me up when<br/>trying to think of 12-EDO. I&apos;ll start imagining weird, inconsistent<br/>hybrids of 12-EDO and whatever I&apos;m playing in, and it&apos;ll become<br/>difficult to visualize 12-EDO melodies.
