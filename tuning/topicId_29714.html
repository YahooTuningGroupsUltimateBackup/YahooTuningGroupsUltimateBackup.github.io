This timbre<br/>is a modified version of the preset &quot;Flute&quot; voice (A23) on the Yahama<br/>TX-802 synthesizer.</p><p>Thank you, John deLaubenfels, for some comments I just saw prompting me to<br/>post this here now.</p><p>As I comment in my MMM post, the contributions of Bill Sethares, as well<br/>as John Chowning and others who have explored the connections between<br/>timbre and tuning, have provided a foundation for explorations like these<br/>demonstrations and pieces in 13-tET -- or 13-EDO or 13-ED2 if you prefer.</p><p>The MMM repost includes links to upload announcements which in turn have<br/>links to the actual files.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>                       -      -      -      -</p><p>Hello, everyone, and I&apos;m pleased to announce that with much assistance<br/>and artistry on the part of Jacky Ligon, three of my 13-tET items<br/>are now available on MMM.

These intervals of around 738 cents might<br/>best be described as in their own class, &quot;fifths&quot; most extraordinary.</p><p>(The timbre is &quot;PuffPipesD,&quot; based on the beautiful built-in voice<br/>&quot;PuffPipes&quot; on the Yamaha TX-802 synthesizer, here modified to make<br/>these 13-tET intervals more smooth or concordant in effect.)</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_42.html#1182">/makemicromusic/topicId_42.html#1182</a><br/>&quot;Chowning Organ Improvisation&quot; (13-tET, Chowning Organ) ~2:30</p><p>This somewhat &quot;jazzy&quot; neo-Gothic piece tries a bit of &quot;floating&quot;<br/>accidentalism or chromaticism with some four-voice sonorities such<br/>as 0-462-738-923 cents (a bit like 14:18:21:24, 0-435-702-933 cents)<br/>or 0-277-702-1015 cents (a bit like 12:14:18:21, 0-267-702-969 cents).<br/>These sonorities maybe suggest what could very loosely be called a<br/>kind of &quot;neo-medieval barbershop&quot; style celebrating the sonorousness<br/>of this tuning. The Chowning Organ is a flutelike timbre named in<br/>honor of John Chowning, the inventor and developer of FM synthesis.</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_42.html#1180">/makemicromusic/topicId_42.html#1180</a><br/>&quot;14th-century improvisation&quot; (13-tET, Piccolo, PuffPipesD) ~2:38</p><p>This take on the 14th century features a timbre called &quot;PuffPipesD,&quot; a<br/>variation on the preset PuffPipes voice with optimization for 13-tET;<br/>the &quot;D&quot; in the title is the hexadecimal notation for the number 13.<br/>The &quot;Piccolo&quot; is a slightly modified version of the preset TX-802<br/>voice by this name (A27), which as is can make an interval of 8/13<br/>octave or a diminished sixth in 1/4-comma meantone (e.g. G#-Eb),<br/>either at ~738 cents, have a consonant effect rather like that of a<br/>usual fifth. One is tempted to wonder if the &quot;Piccolo&quot; preset might<br/>have been designed for such a tuning, for example John Chowning&apos;s<br/>ninth root of Phi scale used in Stria.</p><p>                     *         *         *</p><p>An aside: while it&apos;s sometimes convenient to speak of intervals such<br/>as &quot;fifths&quot; in 13-tET, this tuning has its own &quot;musical geometry&quot; or<br/>&quot;interval arithmetic&quot; often radically different from that of Western<br/>European compositional conventions. We might better speak of &quot;8-step&quot;<br/>intervals, often used in neo-Gothic music based on 13th-14th century<br/>European styles as a kind of near-3:2 stable concord.</p><p>May I warmly thank you, Jacky, not only for making these pieces<br/>available, but for taking the quite inexpert cassette recording which<br/>I mailed you and applying your technical skills and musical experience<br/>alike in seeking the best renditions for our tuning community on the<br/>World Wide Web.</p><p>With peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=29743 href="#29743">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2001 6:25:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 29 Oct 2001 08:52:18 -0800 (PST), mschulter &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;Hello, there, everyone, and it&apos;s my pleasure to let you know that thanks<br/>&gt;to the generous technical assistance and artistry of Jacky Ligon and much<br/>&gt;advice and encouragement from many others, some audio files of neo-Gothic<br/>&gt;music in 13-tET are now available for listening in the Files area of the<br/>&gt;MakeMicroMusic group.</p><p>I still can&apos;t find the Files area of that group.
