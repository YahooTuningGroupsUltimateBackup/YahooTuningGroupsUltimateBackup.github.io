This has to do with repeating points. If the sound waves of two notes are plotted (in phase) then repeating points occur at equal intervals (e.g. the plotted waves look the same every, say, 4 inches).

The following is not in my book but I have a notion that the maximum allowable deviation from a &quot;perfect&quot; interval is 6.776 cents (256/255). In this case the &quot;perfect&quot; interval is 5/4 and the &quot;imperfect&quot; interval is 500/401.

The<br/>1/1. This is the true &quot;root&quot; of the chord.</p><p>But uptill now, we&apos;ve centered all the permutations of the 1/1 2/1 3/1<br/>4/1 5/1 chord on 1/1.<br/>Why not permutate this chord, and not have it have 1/1 in common with<br/>the original chord, but have it have 2/1, or 3/1 or 4/1 in common?<br/>(with 5/1 as the center of permutation we get the exact same results<br/>as with 1/1 as the center)<br/>So a permutation of 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 could also be 8/5 2/1 3/1 4/1<br/>8/1 (1/1 + 5/4 +3/2 +4/3 +2/1 centered on 2/1) etc.<br/>(note that when centering on 2/1, there&apos;s allways one interval below<br/>and 3 above. When centering on 3/1 there&apos;s allways 2 intervals below<br/>and 2 above.

(though offcourse for some<br/>music this will involve modulations, chance of tonic, but this isn&apos;t a<br/>problem at all. And this happends much less than one would think I<br/>think.

Somebody mentioned that chord recently.</p><p>Another way of defining it: 16:15 and 15:14 are identical.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m a huge fan of tempering within 7 cents or so of an octave...<br/>&gt; I often finds it provides a sense of &quot;whole/together-ness&quot; missing<br/>&gt; from un-tempered scales that highly favor certain root notes and/or<br/>&gt; chord types while harming others.</p><p>What does &quot;within 7 cents or so of an octave&quot; mean?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;If you take John&apos;s scale and temper out 225/224, for instance<br/>&gt; by using 72 equal, the same scale turns up yet again. Now how<br/>&gt; much would you pay?&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting, so that would imply many of these experimental<br/>&gt; JI scales merge toward a tempered scale that combines the best<br/>&gt; of all their qualities?</p><p>As the choice between 16:15 and 15:14 is the main arbitrary part of<br/>John&apos;s scale, then yes, different scales will come out the same when<br/>you ignore this distinction.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, I barely think it would sound any different even in<br/>&gt;  something like Adaptive JI to a musically untrained ear for<br/>&gt; almost all intervals (minus the major 3rd and the few other<br/>&gt; intervals 11+ cents off &quot;just&quot;).&nbsp; I do also assume it would<br/>&gt; make a difference in the special case of vocals and guitars<br/>&gt; since they match the harmonic series so accurately, but<br/>&gt; not so much for other instruments.</p><p>Palestrina wrote for voices, and used a lot of major thirds.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=87211 href="#87211">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2010 8:18:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;And there&apos;s a basic rule for microtonal music according to many ears.A held note does not change it pitch slightly, it does not &quot;comma<br/>shift&quot;. (it doesn&apos;t just sound bad, but there are other logical problems with comma shifting held notes)&quot;<br/>     I figure the periodicity would become slightly longer/less-desirable.  But I don&apos;t see how comma-shifting is so bad...especially when you consider that most instruments themselves fluctuate in tone slightly (thus making the overtones themselves already &quot;shifted&quot; to some extent).  The other issue is periodicity buzz...especially with chords using tones of 9/8 interval or smaller it becomes almost grating despite being &quot;in strict JI&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The is the most basic of chords right? And one wouldn&apos;t want to tune it any other way and have it still be as &quot;consonant&quot;.<br/>   Right, but the expression is IMVHO fairly limited and, I&apos;m betting, most people could digest much higher-limit chords IF they don&apos;t violate the critical band so much AKA have many overly close notes.<br/>   Take, for example, ways to summarize the 12TET chord C E F A (which, mostly due to the fact the &quot;overly close&quot; E-F are surrounded by compensating wide intervals, I can show to many people without them saying it&apos;s &quot;too tense&quot;)...I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;ll have a tough time doing that in strict 5-limit.</p><p>   Simply put, I think higher limits can be used with fairly minimal losses of consonance IF people are careful about not putting too many notes close together...and same goes with tempering of &quot;pure&quot; chords (too much temperament on too many notes in a row in a chord can distort the sense of wholeness of the series, but some on occasional notes I find is harmless).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Why tune it any other way?&quot;<br/>  AKA why would I want to bother with higher limits in the first place?  Many many more chords and emotional possibilities...it&apos;s like comparing the musical of someone who knows Debussy&apos;s progressions to someone who knows standard pop progressions.<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;Now if one takes all permutations of this 5th-harmonic- limit 1/1 2/1<br/>3/1 4/1 5/1 chord we get:<br/>1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 (when reduced to one octave)&quot;<br/>Where is the 15/8 calculated from (maybe 3/2 * 5/4)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 (when reduced<br/>to one octave) Note, this is the 12 tone Just Intonation scale! :)&quot;<br/>So you are pretty much using the above ratios and multiplying them by each other to get new ones?<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;And when we combine all permutation of the 6th-harmonic- limit chord,<br/>centered on the root + each of its harmonics (till the 6th harmonic),<br/>we get the following scale: (reduced to one octave)<br/>1/1 25/14 16/15 10/9 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 27/20 25/18 45/32 3/2 25/16 8/5<br/>5/3 27/16 16/9 9/5 15/8 2/1&quot;</p><p>   Now this looks a lot more interesting, minus the fact so many keys would be needed for it.  The only real issue I see is there are so many different (at least at first glance) common LCD&apos;s that it would take a good deal of theory to find all the sweet spots (thus making it harder to catch on among 12TET musicians).  For example 16/15 and 9/8 near having an LCD at 18 (the interval formed is around 19/18 AKA is a &quot;tempered 19/18&quot;) while 25/18 and 4/3 give an LCD of 24 (25/24).</p><p>    The way I see it (please tell me if you find a loop-hole in this) is that even 7-tone JI...the common denominator of all fractions lies somewhere around 24 with the clearer chords having LCDs of mostly 12, 3,6, and 4...and there are way to cut through and find those chords, but it takes a lot of theory.  For example, the chord 1/1 10/9 4/3 25/18.</p><p>    Here is a challenge: find a 7-tone scale within that 19-tone scale that has many 4 note chords  which sound as or more consonant than C E F A does in 12TET.   I agree with you the 19-tone is a flexible enough scale, but the other question becomes can we push it to the average musician without them thinking it&apos;s far too hard to learn?<br/>-----------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;or that my above post shows that what you&apos;re looking for can&apos;t be done in the way you think and that the higher harmonics only have a place in very huge scales (not in a 12tone JI scale).&quot;<br/>    Very huge scales?  I have my doubts...although I see that using your method it requires a lot of notes before such a scale can be formed (though I realize your method could be of great use to those who require scales that allow transposition).<br/>  Again, using even just Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon ratios (completely unmodified be myself) can give a 7-tone scale of 18:20:22:24:27:30:33:36 which is loaded with very consonant chords of over 5-limit.  And again I&apos;ll point out, even the 7-tone JI diatonic rounds down to x/24 as it can be written in lowest form as 24:27:30:32:36:40:45:48 (yes, that means it has a higher LCD/lower-full-scale-periodicity than the Ptolemy-based scale)!</p><p>    I think the rift between most JI theory I&apos;ve seen (in many cases, including yours) is and what I&apos;m trying to do is</p><p>A) People appear to shy away from using close ratios like 11/10, 12/11, and 13/12 or ones anywhere near quarter tones when they decide what chords to use in their scales, presumably because these intervals just &quot;don&apos;t fit common practice&quot;...and indirectly assume they must be &quot;bad&quot; because they are &quot;wrong&quot; in common practice.<br/>  Trying even the basic Homalon-based interval scale (which uses both 11/10 and 12/11) and you&apos;ll find plenty of chords that can be made with the above intervals.  Again I&apos;ll bring up the 12TET C E F A example...there is often nothing terribly wrong with chords that use close spaces or &quot;have&quot; to be summarized at higher limits.</p><p>B)  So many people making JI scales say things like &quot;2/1,3/2,4/3,5/4 are the most consonant ratios because they are the most periodic ones&quot; and ignore the fact they also succeed much because they are among the intervals that avoid critical band dissonance the best since they are so far apart.<br/>     I&apos;ve seen this causes people to avoid chords like 10:13:16 because they jump to the conclusion it must be bad because it&apos;s relatively high-limit, but they forget there is a fair amount of good in the form of good critical band dissonance avoidance (which it shares in common with high-spaced ratios like 3:4) balancing it out and, IMVHO, making it quite listenable regardless of &quot;limit&quot;.<br/>   True, there is a point where periodicity gets so bad chords using such periodicity will sound bad matter how far apart the tones are and how well they &quot;take critical band into account&quot;...but I think that limit is around odd-limit 11 or 13....and certainly not stuck at 5.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And it seems to me all common practice music will fit the 6-limit<br/>tonality model with 6-limit harmonic model! &quot;<br/>   I&apos;ll say this much...I hope you continue looking into &quot;6-limit&quot;...you previous theories seem to just polish existing musical possibilities (though pretty well!)...but I&apos;m really look forward to seeing you open the door to never-before-heard chords and such with 6-limit. :-)</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=87212 href="#87212">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2010 9:00:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham&gt;&quot;The interval 26:33 can&apos;t be reduced, so it isn&apos;t even a 13-limit chord&quot;<br/>    Got it...I suppose you could modify it to 33/27, but that would make 27/22 and 27/20 non-reduce-able.<br/>Meanwhile you could take 34/26 and just make the scale 9:10:11:12:13:15:17:18....but then you&apos;d be stuck at 17-limit and get that nastily close 18/17 interval which screams &quot;critical band dissonance&quot;.</p><p>   Unless you have any smart hacks for this one...I think I&apos;m going to have to stick to the idea that 9:10:11:12:13 is the only large 13-limit chord I can get using consecutive notes from this scale since 10:11:12:13:15 is 15-limit.</p><p>   Then again compared to 7-tone JI diatonic IE 24:27:30:32:36:40:45:48...the one 5-note chord I can find is 24:27:30:36:45 AKA 8:9:10:12:15...which even at &quot;only&quot; 5 notes isn&apos;t even 13-limit.<br/>Same goes for 24:30:32:36:40 AKA 12:15:16:18:20.<br/>---------------<br/>&gt;&quot;One way of thinking about it is that it allows augmented triads with two intervals of 5:4 and one of 9:7 to add up to a 2:1 octave.

I&apos;d like to know if I&apos;ve gotten<br/>&gt; your idea correctly, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>Ah there are many ways to justify this procedure of permutations.<br/>I originaly found it by thinking I wanted to categorise simple to more<br/>complex, perfect to less perfect.<br/>I see the harmonic series as beeing perfect and progressing from simple, to<br/>more complex the higher you go up the harmonics.<br/>Then I said, if the harmonic series is perfect, the the intervals making up<br/>the harmonic series must be perfect too.<br/>And I will work with the perfect intervals, only disturbing their perfect<br/>order.<br/>Another way to see it is that nature tells us how to divide the 4/1, or 5/1,<br/>or 6/1 etc. And I&apos;m simply stating all possible comfigurations of this<br/>perfect division.</p><p>But I&apos;m glad it seems worth exploting to you!<br/>I hope you will get involved in this theory.<br/>I call it Tonal Just Intonation.<br/>And I feel like I&apos;m onto somthing very special here with a great future, but<br/>I can&apos;t do everything alone.<br/>Too much work and thinking, so the more people working on this the better.<br/>Btw, I hope to have a short version of the theory online on my website<br/>within a week.</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=87219 href="#87219">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2010 4:22:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;      I figure the periodicity would become slightly longer/less-desirable.<br/>&gt; But I don&apos;t see how comma-shifting is so bad...especially when you consider<br/>&gt; that most instruments themselves fluctuate in tone slightly (thus making the<br/>&gt; overtones themselves already &quot;shifted&quot; to some extent).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ah we differ of opinion here.<br/>But then fi you don&apos;t mind comma shifts.. the why not use adaptive-ji or<br/>something like that?<br/>You can have every chord as a harmonic series for instance and comma shift<br/>all over the place.<br/>I think it gives terribly out of tune results, but you may think otherwise<br/>(several list members seem to like it)</p><p>&gt; The other issue is periodicity buzz...especially with chords using tones of<br/>&gt; 9/8 interval or smaller it becomes almost grating despite being &quot;in strict<br/>&gt; JI&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t see that.<br/>A semitone is used a lot in chords in even simple common practice music.<br/>Sure 15/8 2/1 will sound better as 1/1 15/8 or 15/8 4/1, but one can use<br/>15/8 2/1 perfectly well depending on the musical context etc.<br/>This even goes for 25/24.</p><p>   Right, but the expression is IMVHO fairly limited<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t think you understand the number of possible chords within 1/1 9/8<br/>6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>I&apos;m better just about every single chord in common practice music and beyong<br/>is in this scale.<br/>The expression possiblity in it is huuuuge. And besides this, expression is<br/>not a single chord, it&apos;s a sequence of chords, melodies, and place relative<br/>to the tonic etc.</p><p>&gt; and, I&apos;m betting, most people could digest much higher-limit chords IF they<br/>&gt; don&apos;t violate the critical band so much AKA have many overly close notes.<br/>&gt;    Take, for example, ways to summarize the 12TET chord C E F A (which,<br/>&gt; mostly due to the fact the &quot;overly close&quot; E-F are surrounded by compensating<br/>&gt; wide intervals, I can show to many people without them saying it&apos;s &quot;too<br/>&gt; tense&quot;)...I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;ll have a tough time doing that in strict<br/>&gt; 5-limit.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Digest much higher limit chords is not easy.<br/>I&apos;ve ran a test making simple 7-limit chords (based on permutations, not<br/>even according to the much more complex and dissonant 7-limit harmonic<br/>model), and even those chords are often extremely difficult and dissonant.</p><p>As for the C E F A. If the tonic is C the it would most likely be 1/1 5/4<br/>4/3 5/3, nice chord.<br/>(it could in extreme circumstances also be 1/1 5/4 27/20 27/16 in the tonic<br/>of C, long story when this happends)<br/>So where&apos;s the 5-limit problem? The E-F is even much wider in 5/4 4/3 than<br/>it is in 12tet (and severely wider in 5/4 27/20)</p><p>   Simply put, I think higher limits can be used with fairly minimal losses<br/>&gt; of consonance IF people are careful about not putting too many notes close<br/>&gt; together...and same goes with tempering of &quot;pure&quot; chords (too much<br/>&gt; temperament on too many notes in a row in a chord can distort the sense of<br/>&gt; wholeness of the series, but some on occasional notes I find is harmless).<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, higher limits can&apos;t be used with fairly minimal loss of consonance with<br/>a 12 tone scale.<br/>Unless one knows exactly what to play, and it is extremely simple, and one<br/>constructs a 12 tone scale with higher limits especially for this.</p><p>As for temperaments, sure! 12-tone temperaments will work great! :)<br/>But then don&apos;t kid yourself into doing Just Intonation.</p><p>  AKA why would I want to bother with higher limits in the first place?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well I ment why bother with higher limits in 12-tone scales.</p><p>&gt;   Many many more chords and emotional possibilities...it&apos;s like comparing<br/>&gt; the musical of someone who knows Debussy&apos;s progressions to someone who knows<br/>&gt; standard pop progressions.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Debussy&apos;s progressions are 6-limit progressions according to my ears.<br/>But perhaps you ment it only as a comparison. And are meaning never heard<br/>chords etc.<br/>Well yes I agree, I would love to be able to use 7-limit in the future.<br/>But in order to do this I think I must understand 6-limit well first, and<br/>that&apos;s still some way off.<br/>But 7-limit and higher limits in 12-tone scales and call it JI? I don&apos;t get<br/>it. And up till now, my ear hasn&apos;t gotten it either, I&apos;ve never come across<br/>a practical music example that sounded right to me.</p><p>&gt; So you are pretty much using the above ratios and multiplying them by each<br/>&gt; other to get new ones?<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, I&apos;m working out all possible permutations of the harmonic series till a<br/>certain limit, and then not multiply them but simply combine them.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And when we combine all permutation of the 6th-harmonic- limit chord,<br/>&gt; centered on the root + each of its harmonics (till the 6th harmonic),<br/>&gt; we get the following scale: (reduced to one octave)<br/>&gt; 1/1 25/14 16/15 10/9 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 27/20 25/18 45/32 3/2 25/16 8/5<br/>&gt; 5/3 27/16 16/9 9/5 15/8 2/1&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Now this looks a lot more interesting, minus the fact so many keys would<br/>&gt; be needed for it.  The only real issue I see is there are so many different<br/>&gt; (at least at first glance) common LCD&apos;s that it would take a good deal of<br/>&gt; theory to find all the sweet spots (thus making it harder to catch on among<br/>&gt; 12TET musicians).  For example 16/15 and 9/8 near having an LCD at 18 (the<br/>&gt; interval formed is around 19/18 AKA is a &quot;tempered 19/18&quot;) while 25/18 and<br/>&gt; 4/3 give an LCD of 24 (25/24).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oh please don&apos;t call anything in my scale &quot;tempered&quot; :)<br/>As for the LCD, that&apos;s not the way to look at it. The harmonic model, the<br/>tonic, and the underlying permuation structures take care of meaning of<br/>relations of 2 pitches. I&apos;ve explained those in the previous mail to some<br/>degree.</p><p>&gt; I agree with you the 19-tone is a flexible enough scale, but the other<br/>&gt; question becomes can we push it to the average musician without them<br/>&gt; thinking it&apos;s far too hard to learn?<br/>&gt;</p><p>No I don&apos;t see it that way.<br/>I see it as beeing in future music theory books for students of composition<br/>and music theory.<br/>I see it beeing developed into clever algorithms for computer programs.<br/>Things like that.</p><p>    Very huge scales?  I have my doubts...although I see that using your<br/>&gt; method it requires a lot of notes before such a scale can be formed (though<br/>&gt; I realize your method could be of great use to those who require scales that<br/>&gt; allow transposition).<br/>&gt;   Again, using even just Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon ratios (completely unmodified be<br/>&gt; myself) can give a 7-tone scale of 18:20:22:24:27:30:33:36 which is loaded<br/>&gt; with very consonant chords of over 5-limit.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Consonant in a tempered kind of way.<br/>It says nothing new musically. Only gives a bit of color in my opinion.</p><p>&gt; And again I&apos;ll point out, even the 7-tone JI diatonic rounds down to x/24<br/>&gt; as it can be written in lowest form as 24:27:30:32:36:40:45:48 (yes, that<br/>&gt; means it has a higher LCD/lower-full-scale-periodicity than the<br/>&gt; Ptolemy-based scale)!<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t see why you have to look at all scales as x/x<br/>If you see my tonality scale and see the way it&apos;s constructed it&apos;s all<br/>related to the tonic 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 chord. Every single note.<br/>x/24 isn&apos;t something magical indicating tonic. One can play 6/5 from the<br/>tonic perfectly well aswell etc.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And it seems to me all common practice music will fit the 6-limit<br/>&gt; tonality model with 6-limit harmonic model! &quot;<br/>&gt;    I&apos;ll say this much...I hope you continue looking into &quot;6-limit&quot;...you<br/>&gt; previous theories seem to just polish existing musical possibilities (though<br/>&gt; pretty well!)...but I&apos;m really look forward to seeing you open the door to<br/>&gt; never-before-heard chords and such with 6-limit. :-)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks :)<br/>I think it&apos;s not so long off before that happends.<br/>But I have to do some more retuning of existing music to get a better grip<br/>on things.</p><p>Would you like to join in that?<br/>Simply grab some common practice music you like, find the tonic, and try to<br/>retune it to JI using 6-limit harmonic and tonality models.<br/>This still seems like the best way to get a deeper understanding of JI and<br/>how some parts of music works etc.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=87221 href="#87221">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2010 8:19:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;But then fi you don&apos;t mind comma shifts.. the why not use adaptive-ji or something like that?&quot;<br/>A few reasons<br/>A) At least in the implementations I&apos;ve seen, it &quot;only&quot; supports standard practice intervals.  If I want to use, say, the 12/11 interval in a non-standard chord like 9:11:12:15, I can&apos;t.  And if I want a huge and dense chord like 18:20:24:27:30:33...Adaptive JI will simply try and pull a simple chord IE 18:24:27 or 6:8:9 and leave the other tones as neighboring tones, thus mangling the feel/emotion of the original chord.</p><p>B) It makes chords that create periodicity buzz due to &quot;overly perfect&quot; matching...often to the point of sounding quite rough/mechanical and, to a degree, not human.</p><p>C) It&apos;s virtually impossible to implement on acoustic instruments, and thus near-impossible to market to people who use such instruments.</p><p>D) The theory is hard to market as it involves teaching musicians music theory from scratch to fit whatever scale you are feeding in to the adaptive JI algorithm.  That is, unless you use 12TET as the basis for it...in which case you don&apos;t get any extra dimensions of emotion (which is half the fun of micro-tonal music to me), but instead just more purity.</p><p>     To me Adaptive JI is a great solution for those who tolerate comma shifts and periodicity buzz well, work with common practice music, compose music on electronic instruments only, and don&apos;t mind being stuck with mostly the same intervals/emotions they&apos;d get from diatonic scales under 12TET so long as they get extra purity.  For those who want to get past any of those limitations, however, there must be a better option.<br/>***************************************************************.<br/>Marcel&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t see that. A semitone is used a lot in chords in even simple common practice music.&quot;....&quot;This even goes for 25/24.&quot;<br/>  I actually agree (for the most part)...but, in that case, why do you seem so intent on sticking with only low limit chords?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think you understand the number of possible chords within 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 I&apos;m better just about every single chord in common practice music and beyond is in this scale.&quot;<br/>   Here are some challenges<br/>A) How would the 12TET chord C E F A B work in that scale?<br/>B) How about C D G A B?<br/>C) And C E G A B?<br/>D) Now try F G C D E<br/>E) And F A C D E<br/>    These are some of the &quot;beyond&quot; chords I&apos;m eager to see perfected in a single (and not huge!) JI scale.  They (at least to me) gives unique moods but I doubt any Adaptive JI software, for example, would successfully attempt to turn them into full chords well.<br/>----------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve ran a test making simple 7-limit chords (based on permutations,<br/>not even according to the much more complex and dissonant 7-limit<br/>harmonic model), and even those chords are often extremely difficult<br/>and dissonant.&quot;<br/>   I think it may be fair to say you have a natural bias (perhaps partly due to musical training) far toward 5-limit.  I hear a consonance difference between 5 and 7 in general...but I don&apos;t think they are by any means immensely different so far as consonance just 7 is (in general)...a bit weirder.</p><p>&gt;&quot;As for the C E F A. If the tonic is C the it would most likely be 1/1 5/4 4/3 5/3, nice chord.&quot;<br/>     Bizarre, because it certainly doesn&apos;t seem to simplify down to any low-limit chord.  Using the LCD of 12 you get 12/12 15/12 16/12 20/12........AKA 12:15:16:20...doesn&apos;t seem very &quot;low limit&quot; to me...although I agree it&apos;s a very nice chord.<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;So where&apos;s the 5-limit problem? The E-F is even much wider in 5/4 4/3 than it is in 12tet (and severely wider in 5/4 27/20)&quot;<br/>   Come to think of it...the 27/20 actually works quite well to my ears...it&apos;s barely outside of the 13/12 limit where my ears start telling me two tones are pushing the critical band too much.  Then again, I was using C E F A as a fairly &quot;easy&quot; example.  If you want hard, try chords A) B) C) D) and E) above. :-)<br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;No, higher limits can&apos;t be used with fairly minimal loss of consonance with a 12 tone scale.<br/>Unless<br/>one knows exactly what to play, and it is extremely simple, and one<br/>constructs a 12 tone scale with higher limits especially for this.&quot;<br/>    Well how about a scale (try to use as few notes as possible) that enables A) B) C) D) and E) given above?  Try to do it keeping a strict 6-limit standard and then let yourself stretch that scale to as many limits or temper &quot;as needed&quot; to best fit all the chords.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;Well I meant why bother with higher limits in 12-tone scales.&quot;<br/>   Again, try the above challenge.  I&apos;m convinced it can be done with 12 tones or less...but only if you free yourself from this so-called absolute necessity of staying within very low limits of JI.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>Me&gt;&quot;(the interval formed is around 19/18 AKA is a &quot;tempered 19/18&quot;) while 25/18 and 4/3 give an LCD of 24 (25/24).&quot;<br/>Marcel&gt;&quot;Oh please don&apos;t call anything in my scale &quot;tempered&quot; :)&quot;<br/>  Why not?...I actually meant it as a complement meaning the interval between the tones comes across to my ears as more periodic than it actually is.<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;As for temperaments, sure! 12-tone temperaments will work great! :)  But then don&apos;t kid yourself into doing Just Intonation.&quot;<br/>   What&apos;s so alien about the idea of slight temperaments from JI, particularly when they enable many more chords with incredibly small loss of accuracy regarding periodicity?</p><p>Me&gt;&quot;I<br/>agree with you the 19-tone is a flexible enough scale, but the other<br/>question becomes can we push it to the average musician without them<br/>thinking it&apos;s far too hard to learn?&quot;<br/>Marcel&gt;&quot;No I don&apos;t see it that way. I see it as being in future music theory books for students of composition and music theory.  I see it being developed into clever algorithms for computer programs.<br/>Things like that.&quot;<br/>   Sounds good only my question becomes...how do you plan to realistically get, say, music teachers to adapt this theory and, furthermore, for students to have the patience to learn to understand it?<br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;Again,<br/>using even just Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon ratios (completely unmodified be<br/>myself) can give a 7-tone scale of 18:20:22:24: 27:30:33: 36 which is<br/>loaded with very consonant chords of over 5-limit.<br/>Consonant in a tempered kind of way. It says nothing new musically. Only gives a bit of color in my opinion.&quot;<br/>    And new/different color isn&apos;t something new?  Considering just how much work is done programming new sounds and timbres by electronic musicians and even use of different orchestral arrangements to get new &quot;colors&quot; into music, I&apos;m still betting there&apos;s a demand for that.  That and (until/unless you and others manage to disprove it), I&apos;m still sticking by the idea that such scales as that have more possible chords than in 7-tone diatonic JI and that musicians will find the extra chords give them inspiration for fresh new songs.<br/>--------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t see why you have to look at all scales as x/x<br/>If you see my<br/>tonality scale and see the way it&apos;s constructed it&apos;s all related to the<br/>tonic 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 chord. Every single note. x/24 isn&apos;t something magical indicating tonic.&quot;<br/>    True, but my point is if the whole scale reduces to something reasonable and with many possible common denominators (IE an x/24 scale has 8 (IE 8:9:11),6 (IE 6:7:8) , 4 (IE 4:5:6), 3 (IE 3:4:5) and 2 (IE 2:3:4)  as possible chord structures.<br/>&gt;&quot;One can play 6/5 from the tonic perfectly well as well etc.&quot;<br/>   Right, but that just summarizes the starting point for a dyad.  For a triad you could be thinking &quot;x/5&quot; if you were lucky enough to stumble upon a  5:6:7 chord.  More likely though (and especially with large chords), you could be stuck with an &quot;x/10&quot; chord IE 1/1 6/5 3/2.  Hence if you are thinking of a quick way to look at a JI scale and get an idea of which parts of the series all possible chords are rooted at, you can take factors of the LCD for the whole scale.</p><p>(not shouting, just stressing the below as important)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>   IN SHORT, THE WHOLE X/18 OR X/24 TYPE NOTATION OF SCALES IS MY OWN PERSONAL SYSTEM FOR EVALUATING THE GENERAL LEVEL OF PERIODICITY PLUS THE CRITICAL BAND COMPLIANCE IN A SCALE.<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>   So if a scale is x/18 IE 18:20:22:24:27:30:33:36, it&apos;s more likely to be periodic than one that&apos;s x/24.  And, in that form, you can quickly find the smallest interval and match it to where you think critical band dissonance becomes too harsh (for me the closest interval possible to avoid this is around 1.08333).<br/>  So this way I can see clearly that 22/20 and 36/33 are the closest intervals in the scale and quickly judge the associated critical band dissonance.<br/>  So far as I can see the &quot;limit&quot; notation system has no easy way of doing this...you&apos;re stuck with calculating the closest intervals from scratch.  Although sadly, I don&apos;t see many people doing this because (as I&apos;ve said before) it seems far too many people don&apos;t seem to understand the critical band&apos;s role in consonance (particularly in enabling chords with many consecutive closely-spaced intervals)</p><p>  And with tempering you can do cool things like get the benefits of an &quot;x/12&quot; and an &quot;x/18&quot; scale in one scale, IE getting possible not-so-high-limit chords based on x/2,x/3, x/4, x/6, x/9, x/12, and x/18 (all factors of x/12 and x/18) in one scale and, at worst, get about &quot;x/18&quot; level periodicity.</p><p>    Far as the level of periodicity you appear to be going for, I&apos;d recommend &quot;x/12&quot; scales...that way you&apos;re guaranteed to get no worse/higher-up-the-series than 23/24 and far more likely to get something more like 13/12 (not far at all up the harmonic series, and better that way than 15/14).<br/>   An easy x/12 scale that has good periodicity yet isn&apos;t just a straight harmonic series is<br/>12:14:15:16:18:20:22:24<br/>...how does that scale work for you?</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;Would you like to join in that?<br/>Simply grab some common practice music you like, find the tonic, and<br/>try to retune it to JI using 6-limit harmonic and tonality models.<br/>This still seems like the best way to get a deeper understanding of JI and how some parts of music works etc.&quot;<br/>   Sure thing, I&apos;ll try it with some of my old 12TET tunes: I was notorious for using &quot;not-quite-legal&quot; 6+ note chords before I discovered micro-tonal music. :-)</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=87223 href="#87223">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2010 8:33:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are writing multiplications as if they were additions here, but without<br/>&gt; &gt; introducing logarithms.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Yes I am, but I find it perfectly ok to do it that way.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s easily understood, both by our mind and our ear.</p><p>I&apos;m a mathematician, and it confused me.

Replacing one false hegemony with<br/>another is not the answer.&quot;</p><p>    As many of you can imagine (and perhaps even agree with), I feel the idea of &quot;common practice&quot; is a curse that keeps us from experiencing many of the dimensions of tonality that micro-tonality has to offer.</p><p>    Another thing just about anyone could argue is that the ultimate 12-tone scale is 12:13:14:15:16...24 AKA simply harmonics number 1-12 of the series or that the ultimate 7-tone scale is undoubtedly harmonics 7 to 14.   After all, those are the scales which best follow the harmonic series, right?<br/>   When you start trying to maximize the consonance of, say, triads though or simply want to establish a sense of different root tones to add (gasp) tonal color to your music.   You may quickly figure out that harmonics 9:11:14 from the 7-14th harmonics might not be the chord with the best periodicity you can imagine.  Thus you may split parts of the series up into different types of triads and stack them together and get something like 7-tone diatonic JI.  But then you realize there are intervals in there which are less periodic than those in the 7-14 harmonic series.<br/>    Want to optimize the periodicity of 4-tone chords (tetra-chords or otherwise) instead?  Be prepared for at least one completely different scale system which will conflict in ways with both diatonic JI and the 7-14 harmonic series.   You might even have to deal with (gasp) higher limit chords.</p><p>   And if you abandon the idea of &quot;common practice&quot; and allow for the idea of chords using much higher harmonics with a fair amount of spacing (IE a 12:13:16 chord) and then optimize triads and 4-tone chords, you&apos;ll get at least two more completely different answers.  BTW (show of hands), how many people hear thing higher harmonics can be used very consonantly if the chords they are used to create are spaced widely enough apart (to avoid critical band dissonance)?</p><p>   And if you want to make a tuning that allows modulation between of any of the above scales with near-consistent accurately in different keys, be prepared to sacrifice other things such as use of &quot;pure JI&quot; and deal with &quot;ghastly phenomena&quot; such as comma shifts and temperament (as you/Marcel and so many others have run into). ;-)<br/>**************************************************<br/>   The point is...there is no ideal system.  The system I&apos;m working with now (and using in my song entry to Sevish&apos;s micro-tonal competition) is built to handle the next to last situation I mentioned (IE it doesn&apos;t allow modulation).   In giving itself that flexibility, it aims to allow for more chords and larger chords (IE often 5-6 notes per octave) that sound fairly though not extremely consonant.  It sacrifices JI &quot;purity&quot; of many smaller chords and does some de-tuning off JI intervals to accomplish this, but gains certain advantages such as the smallest interval being very near the less harsh 13/12 instead of the usual 15/14 of diatonic JI.</p><p>   In the end &gt;&gt;&gt;(vote of confidence here anyone?)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; micro-tonality is a &quot;game&quot; of &lt;&lt;&lt;different compromises (and not just a few!...that would lead us on a road to 12TET)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.  For everything you gain you lose something else and you have to decide what&apos;s important to you when designing or choosing scales.</p><p>  I will say more respected and/or &quot;better&quot; scales tend to reap more advantages with less sacrifices.  But I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the only one who thinks the idea of a perfect scale with &quot;all benefits and no sacrifices&quot; is not possible nor would it be a good thing (it would basically kill all the fun we have here)...such would be like having a formula to produce beautiful music that &quot;always worked&quot; and then having machines compose everything.</p><p>__,_._,__</p></div><h3><a id=87235 href="#87235">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2010 3:32:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The principle sources of the idea that there can be a &quot;the&quot; &gt;answer are<br/>&gt; the bogus universality of 12-tET and the whacko cartoon of &quot;common<br/>&gt; practice&quot; it has helped propagate.

thinking and it just doesn&apos;t make enough<br/>sense, and an alternative I&apos;ve had in the back of my mind has started<br/>to make great sense.<br/>I had rejected the model of centering on intervals other than 1/1<br/>before, but had some more insight into tonality about a week ago and<br/>used my old model again as it seemed to work.<br/>Sorry for the attention some of you allready gave this model that is now lost.</p><p>Ok here for the new tonality model:<br/>The permutation model is correct when permutating from 1/1.<br/>The harmonic model resulting from the permutation  model is correct.<br/>5-limit harmonic model is: 1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 (when reduced<br/>to one octave)<br/>6-limit harmonic model is: 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8<br/>2/1 (reduced to octave)<br/>7-limit harmonic model is: 1/1 21/20 35/32 9/8 7/6 6/5 5/4 21/16 4/3<br/>7/5 35/24 3/2 14/9 8/5 5/3 7/4 9/5 28/15 15/8 35/18 2/1 (reduced to<br/>octave)<br/>etc<br/>(btw reducing to octave is offcourse ok because of ocave equivalence)</p><p>Now at the basis of tonality is the tonal chord.<br/>The 5-limit tonal chord is 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 (or simply 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>when reduced to one octave)<br/>The 6-limit tonal chord is 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 6/1 (or simply 1/1 5/4 3/2)<br/>The 7-limit tonal chord is 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 6/1 7/1 (or simply 1/1<br/>5/4 3/2 7/4)</p><p>Tonality means that all notes beeing played in a certain tonality/key<br/>must harmonize with the tonal chord.<br/>The harmonic model combined with the tonal chord will now tell all the<br/>possibilities<br/>The way to do this is as follows.</p><p>In the 5-limit harmonic model<br/>1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>We look how many times and where the 5-limit tonic chord can exist.<br/>We see it can exist at 1/1 5/4 3/2, and at 4/3 5/3 2/1<br/>So we get 1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>And 1/1 9/8 5/4 45/32 3/2 15/8 2/1 (which is 4/3 5/3 2/1 transposed to<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2)<br/>Combine those, and we get the 5-limit tonality model/scale:<br/>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>All these tones can be reached while holding the 5-limit tonic chord<br/>and complying to the 5-limit harmonic model.</p><p>In the 6-limit harmonic model<br/>1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>We look how many times and where the 6-limit tonic chord can exist.<br/>We see it can exist at 1/1 5/4 3/2, at 6/5 3/2 8/5, at 4/3 5/3 2/1, at<br/>3/2 15/8 9/4 and at 8/5 2/1 12/5.<br/>So we get 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 (harmonic model<br/>root at 1/1)<br/>and 1/1 25/24 10/9 5/4 4/3 25/18 3/2 25/16 5/3 15/8 2/1 (6/5 to 1/1,<br/>harmonic model root at 5/3)<br/>and 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 27/20 45/32 3/2 27/16 9/5 15/8 2/1 (4/3 to 1/1,<br/>harmonic model root at 3/2)<br/>and 1/1 16/15 10/9 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 2/1 (3/2 to 1/1,<br/>harmonic model root at 4/3)<br/>and 1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 15/8 2/1 (8/5 to 1/1,<br/>harmonic model root at 5/4)<br/>See all the above tranpositions of the harmonic model have the 6-limit<br/>tonic chord at 1/1.<br/>Meaning every tone in the above scales will harmonize with the tonic<br/>chord according to the 6-limit harmonic model.<br/>Combine all these scales and you get the 6-limit tonality model / scale:</p><p>1/1 25/24 16/15 10/9 9/8 75/64 6/5 5/4 4/3 27/20 25/18 45/32 3/2 25/16<br/>8/5 5/3 27/16 16/9 9/5 15/8 2/1</p><p>It is a 20 tone per octave scale.<br/>It is almost equal to my previous 6-limit tonality scale, it has one<br/>extra tone, 75/64 (which will finally give a consonant major triad on<br/>15/8 which I was missing in my previous tonality model (and a<br/>consonant minor traid on 25/16))<br/>(Btw luckily this doesn&apos;t seem to affect my Drei Equale tuning which<br/>still appears correct to

I believe that you are correct in the assessment that<br/>&gt; they won&apos;t occur together, such an occurance would almost certainly be the<br/>&gt; result of an unlikely deliberate compositional choice, but if they occur in<br/>&gt; the same piece of music, that is considered, and heard, as syntonic<br/>&gt; movement, a bitterly disputed thing among choral folks by the way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And also by the way, I do not disagree with you that syntonic variation of<br/>&gt; an interval within a piece is unsingable, impossible, blah blah, as some<br/>&gt; claim (do you have access to JSTOR?).<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t have access to JSTOR.<br/>But we seem in agreement here that syntonic (and other comma variations) are<br/>possible withing a piece.

The principle<br/>&gt; sources of the idea that there can be a &quot;the&quot; answer is the bogus<br/>&gt; universality of 12-tET and the whacko cartoon of &quot;common practice&quot; it has<br/>&gt; helped propagate. Replacing one false hegemony with another is not the<br/>&gt; answer.<br/>&gt;<br/>Well, my approach is simply trying to make sense of things that I feel<br/>should make sense (if that makes sense ;)<br/>My system doesn&apos;t say anything is impossible. Infact anything is possible,<br/>it&apos;s just that it categorizes the possiblities.<br/>Infact not even syntonic comma shifts in repeating notes are impossible, but<br/>one would have to go to 8-limit interpretations in order to get those.<br/>And that&apos;s simply not very likely, and a very difficult interpretation.<br/>And in other ways, my theory offers the possiblity to work mathematically<br/>with music, in a musical way.<br/>And many other things 12tet doesn&apos;t offer (+ my theory produces tuning<br/>results that sound much more consonant and emotional etc)<br/>And think our brain and nature are doing something similar to my theory.<br/>So in these and other aspects there&apos;s a lot I think is &quot;right&quot; here. And I<br/>think it will give new insights into music.<br/>So by these grounds I don&apos;t think it&apos;s right to call it a false hegemony, or<br/>compare it on equal grounds with false hegemonies.<br/>But I do get your point :) And the future will tell how usefull my theory<br/>will end up to be.<br/>(it&apos;s just my personal drive to understand things, that I have to think<br/>there&apos;s logic and perfection in music, why else bother to try to understand)</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=87246 href="#87246">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2010 10:15:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Btw a few more things I&apos;d like to add about 7-limit.<br/>While I think just about all common practice music is 6-limit (with<br/>the very rare exceptions probably which I have not encountered yet).<br/>7-limit is ok too.

A very impure major 7th chord may still be much more pure than, say, an as-pure-as-possible diminished 7th.  My point is that you&apos;re always going to have a range of purity no matter how &quot;just&quot; your scale is...and you might want to take into more consideration the idea of making intolerably dissonant chords into &quot;decent&quot; ones over ideas like purifying things like already far-more-consonant-than-needed-to-be-acceptable 7th chords.</p><p>&gt;&quot;but because it obscures the<br/>logic that I see in JI&quot;<br/>I will easily agree to that.  If I make a tempered tuning, I always keep the original JI scale it is based on (or sometimes also, a list of chords that I tempered off the original JI version to match) to explain how I came up with it.  JI is great that way (and, hey, so are things like the circle of 5ths)...they make it much easier to explain music quickly.</p></div><h3><a id=87258 href="#87258">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2010 12:49:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Aah you&apos;re talking about the tonality model.<br/>&gt; First of all, the old tonality model is sacked.

But I think its important not to turn to conspiracy theories while forgetting both the problems that it solved and its many practical advantages. One of the effects of detuning all notes equally is that each note now serves a double function as both intervals between keys and within chords, which makes it very practical and efficient. Sure C# = Db might be a lack of distinction for the chord based intervals but it doesn&apos;t take into account this second function as intervals between keys.

What I meant was that by taking the n&apos;th root of 2 we are solving the problem of equalisation between notes-as-keys. 2^(n/12) is *that* value which equals 2 when multiplied by itself n times. It&apos;s analogous to the creation of complex numbers to reach where the rationals can&apos;t get too. Once there it can take on a life of its own. The sqrt2 for eg is the only value which is the same under inversion 1:sqrt2 = sqrt2:2. In a manner of speaking this is a 2-tET by its own right. If we take a rational version, say 45/32, then this never reaches the 8ve exactly: (45/32)^2 = 1.977...Same with the diminished 7 chord which is also invariant to inversion and is a 4-tET. And for *these* types of symmetries, even-numbered roots of the 8ve, 12, 24, 36 for eg, seem to excel. There exist no better numbers which meet this demand, not even in principle. Even Helmholtz didn&apos;t realise the types of harmonies that would come out later with Thelonius Monk etc...saying that the Meantone system was better than 12-tET. Not for these harmonies it isn&apos;t.</p><p>Now these symmetries sound very much in tune to my ears and I notice when they have be detuned (Marcel&apos;s Beethoven would clash whenever the diminished chords were hit, while the rest would sound very beautiful). Perhaps what I&apos;m getting at is that my &apos;ideal&apos; system would not be an adaptive JI but an adaptive JI nested inside an ET tuning. To move from C maj to C#dim7, the notes of the C maj are JI but the interval between the C and C#, and the notes of C#dim7, are 12-tET or what have you. In short, I feel that to make everything JI or rational is to fail to distinguish between tonality = rational and atonality = irrational, and that these atonalities have their own place in history and tuning in their own right. Sure, other cultures use other tunings but westerners too need to bring something to the table. To undermine this under the banner of &apos;cultural harmony&apos; is kind of defeating the purpose.

I used to think this because I knew that GCD&apos;s -&gt; tonic. Since this requires rationals then it follows that irrationals cannot have a GCD and are therefore &apos;atonal&apos;.

If we look at the wave of say the irrational minor third as 2^0.25 and solve for the first significant near period it gives ~GCD = (1 + 2^0.25)/(1 + (6/5)).

But it doesn&apos;t have a tonic precisely because every note bears the *same relation* to every other which is why they&apos;re called symmetric. In 12 ET its standard to symbolise the n in 2^(n/12) by 0,1,2,...11. (i.e. Since adding exponents is equivalent to multiplying intervals; 2^(n/12)*2^(m/12) = 2^((n+m)/12)). Now, the inverse of n is 12 - n. But since 12 = 0 (mod 12) then the inverse of n is -n. The dim 7 is 0:3:6:9. If we call the 3 the tonic 0 then it becomes -3:0:3:6 = 9:0:3:6. Next, 6 as tonic is -6:-3:0:3 = 6:9:0:3. Finally 9 = 0 gives 9:3:6:0. Since every note has equal claim to be the tonic then none of them are. If we put them back into exponential form then it becomes clear that this equalisation is *only exact for the irrational numbers*. Dim7 is 2^(0/12) = 1:2^(3/12) = 2^(1/4)etc... In 12-ET the possibilities are chromatic (12 semitones, 4ths or 5ths), whole-tone (6 tones), dim7 (4 minor thirds or major sixths), augmented (3 maj thirds or min 6ths), and the tritone, the only symmetric interval. Of course if we take any other ET then the same thing applies. 18-ET would be 0,1,2,...17 and 18 = 0.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   If so, makes sense but, again, my question is why does this kind of &quot;in between GCD/tonality&quot; pattern have to be in only 12TET?    Take the x/12 and x/18 harmonic series (two of my favorites because of in how many places they overlap).</p><p>I hope I just answered that. It applies to any tuning 2^(x/y) where y is some whole number and x = 0,1,2,...(y - 1). Any number that divides into y an integral amount of times will be a symmetry. 18 for eg divides 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 plus their inverses 17, 16, 15 and 12. Adding these numbers to itself will arrive back at 18 or a multiple thereof. But don&apos;t confuse this symmetry with the approx GCD&apos;s. These are trying to explain *tonalities* between intervals. 81 and 64 are close to the 5th and 4th harmonics of tonic 16.111...for eg.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    If you, for example, treat the two series as two different keys you&apos;ll see they overlap exactly in many places and, with some de-tuning/temperament between two tones thrown in (noted as &quot;averages at&quot;), near intersect by about 12 cents error of each note or less (about the same error range as 12TET) on different notes:<br/>&gt; x/12__________________x/18 (intersection or near intersection with x/12)<br/>&gt; 13/12 = 1.0833333<br/>&gt; 14/12 = 1.1666666______21/18 (exact intersection)<br/>&gt; 15/12 = 1.25___________23/18 = 1.2777777 average at 1.2636<br/>&gt; 16/12 = 1.333333333____24/18 (exact intersection)<br/>&gt; 17/12 = 1.41666666<br/>&gt; 18/12 = 1.5____________27/18(exact intersection)<br/>&gt; 19/12 = 1.583333333____28/18 = 1.555555 average at 1.57<br/>&gt; 20/12 = 1.666666666666 _30/18 (exact intersection)<br/>&gt; 21/12 = 1.75<br/>&gt; 22/12 = 1.833333333333_33/18 (exact intersection)<br/>&gt; 23/12 = 1.916666666666_34/18 = 1.8888888 average at 1.9<br/>&gt;   Also note, both 12 and 18 share the common factors of 2,3, and 6 which are well within the kind of low-denominator results your GCD algorithm shoots for (if I have it right).</p><p>This doesn&apos;t seem like an unreasonable 12 note scale in its own right. But it&apos;s important not to confuse the fact that this has 12 notes with a 12-ET.
