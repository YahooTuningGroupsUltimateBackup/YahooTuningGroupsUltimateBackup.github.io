I lean towards<br/>1/4 myself--again, me being a 31-toner, that&apos;s probably not surprising.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu">manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Well, so far, every time I break he runs out.<br/>  -\-\-- o    But he&apos;s gotta slip up sometime . . . &quot;</p><p>             NOTE: dehyphenate node to remove spamblock.          &lt;*&gt;</p></div>
