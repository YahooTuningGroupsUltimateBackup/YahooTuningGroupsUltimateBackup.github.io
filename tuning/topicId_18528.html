Try to write<br/>a piece of music which is several minutes long. Create an mp3 of your<br/>composition and share the results and experience of your<br/>aesthetic/mathematical choices with the members of this list, with<br/>explanation. Where you may not compose, hire or collaborate with an<br/>actual musician or composer by giving them the scales and stylistic<br/>direction which will finally help all to understand your theory in an<br/>*audible* manner. Join in the joyous experience of music creation by<br/>coming out from behind the abstract barrier of ASCII, and transmit<br/>your findings in the form of living, breathing and evolving music.<br/>Bonus points are given to those who can produce more than one<br/>composition or CD by the end of the year.</p><p>When I came here about a year ago, much of the these theoretical<br/>concepts were manifest in the form of isolated chord examples, and to<br/>my knowledge this is the frozen state which they remain in<br/>(astounding to me). I yearn to hear these theoretical concepts, which<br/>I have been so intensely following, manifest in actual music which<br/>moves the spirit, and compels one to look closer at the underlying<br/>theory. Especially interesting to me, would be even just one example<br/>of a compelling melodic line, which would show me that the<br/>transposition of the theory onto actual music is indeed possible.<br/>Show me by example, the value of what you have to offer<br/>theoretically, in the tangible form of music and I will be enriched<br/>by the experience of seeing and hearing the results of your theory<br/>come full circle by reaching this final stage. Let the fruits of your<br/>theoretical labors be revealed in 2001, after this long period of<br/>aging.</p><p>I propose here, that this will be of greatest importance to all on<br/>this list who come here to learn from you, as I originally did.  We<br/>frequently speak about the &quot;pre-compositional&quot; work being done here.<br/>I&apos;m sure that many would like to see something audible come forth,<br/>and would feel it unfortunate if it all perpetually languishes in<br/>a &quot;pre-compositional&quot; state.  The challenge is to balance the scales<br/>back toward the musical direction. We also give great weight to the<br/>audibility of this and that - so lets hear it!</p><p>Eagerly awaiting your musical contributions to the list,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>P.S. Audiences and list members can not live on dyads and isolated<br/>chords alone. Frank Zappa used to use a great metaphor - he spoke<br/>about &quot;putting the eyebrows on the music&quot;.  I want to hear your<br/>eyebrows. With all the paper flapping, I can&apos;t hear a thing.</p><p>Profusion of Eyebrowed smiley things coming at you!</p><p>}:  )  }:  )  }:  )  }:  )  }:  )  }:  )  }:  )  }:  )  }:  )  }:  )</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2001 1:41:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky Ligon wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;Now that I&apos;m approaching a full year on this list, and have been<br/>eagerly awaiting the final musical distillation of the purely<br/>*theoretical* ideas put forth here,&gt;&gt;</p><p>There are of course some very different theoretical ideas put forth by<br/>some very different folks here, and my bet would be that if you don&apos;t<br/>much care for an individuals ideas in their purely theoretical state,<br/>then said somebody&apos;s probably not going to exactly light you on fire<br/>if they set out to make them manifest in music... I don&apos;t think a<br/>challenge like this would be a way to get good music happening &lt;!&gt;...<br/>To make a point? Well, that&apos;s sort of another can o&apos; worms altogether<br/>I guess.</p><p>John Starrett&apos;s &quot;Tuning Punks&quot; went quite a ways towards giving this<br/>forum something like an experiential non ASCII musical life, but I<br/>guess things obviously won&apos;t ever satisfy everybody&apos;s personal idea of<br/>what&apos;s best.</p><p>Leave music making to those who are honestly driven to do so, and the<br/>theorizing to those who are really driven to do so, and everything&apos;s<br/>bound to fall into place -- well, close enough anyway!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
