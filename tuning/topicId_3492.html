If you can&apos;t hear the difference there&apos;s not<br/>a lot of point in worrying about it anyway. Maybe a group like the Hilliard<br/>sings too broad a repertoire to be a useful term of reference. Then many<br/>fine choral groups today have a percentage of members who &#x9;have &apos;perfect<br/>pitch&apos;, a phenomenon which probably didn&apos;t exist in a period in which<br/>organs and other instruments varied from town to town in Italy. The other<br/>day I heard Michel P&#xFFFD;r&#xFFFD;s &apos;Ensemble Organum&apos; singing in a church in Cremona;<br/>I was glad to have read Margo&apos;s pythagorean piece and appreciated being<br/>able to listen to chords built up of perfect 4ths - that to us would be<br/>discords with clashing major 2nds - in 4-part P&#xFFFD;rotin (conductus &apos;Deus<br/>misertus&apos;). However, that piece was fortunately near the beginning; tuning<br/>later suffered. They also sang VERY loud all the time (as if they were in<br/>Notre-Dame when in fact they were in a tiny church) and scooped quite a lot.<br/>Normally any good group of singers, whether amateur or profis, whether they<br/>understand the first thing about tuning or not, will tend to pitch any<br/>interval in tune. (You can try that out by playing an open fifth - even a<br/>lousy narrow ET one! - and asking almost anyone to pitch the third. They<br/>will normally be better at doing that than your average piano.)<br/>There is quite a bit of Renaissance music if well sung a cap. that may end<br/>up slightly higher or lower than it started, simply because pitches are<br/>being constantly adjusted. This minimal change in pitch shouldn&apos;t worry us,<br/>though of course it disturbs anyone with &apos;perfect pitch&apos;.<br/>I play a chromatic (19 key) hpd and by retuning my d flat to give me a<br/>second (lower) D - and also having 2 f#s and 2 b flats - can amuse myself<br/>with JI. There of course it is impossible to do what singers do BUT if I<br/>play, say, a g minor triad and then a B flat major one, even though NO note<br/>remains the same one, because the sound is just the ear is tricked into<br/>accepting the tiny change.</p><p>Re Salinas and the 19-note kb. S says 1/3 comma m-t is a most difficult<br/>one to tune. I can vouch for that.<br/>I wouls imagine that even those who had 19-note kbs (and there were quite a<br/>lot in Italy c1600 apparently) probably all had their little differences in<br/>tuning them. 1/4 comma was basically the most obvious way - and I don&apos;t<br/>believe Costeley really wanted 1/3 comma even tho he talks about the<br/>intervals being the same, &apos;cos otherwise he could have composed a piece<br/>that went round the full circle (like Mayone did for Colonna&apos;s 31 note<br/>outfit); but he didn&apos;t, presumably because he rejected 1/3 comma 5ths (i.e.<br/>&apos;19-note ET&apos;) since he was apparently primarily interested in people<br/>singing good if not perfect intervals. 1/3 comma 5th just aren&apos;t nice to<br/>sing.</p><p>Christopher Stembridge, Wiesen 167, 39040 PFITSCH (BZ), Italy.<br/>Fax/Tel +39 0472 76 73 66<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.continuo.com/stembridge/chris.htm">http://www.continuo.com/stembridge/chris.htm</a>&gt;</p></div>
