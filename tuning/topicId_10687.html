I guess this is to be expected<br/>since there are only 6 pitches and the ratios resulting from the<br/>factoring are quite different in each.  I bet a person could devote a<br/>WHOLE LIFETIME to just working with different hexanies.  (Is that YOU,<br/>Kraig Grady??)  This is a MUCH different experience that working with<br/>the various &quot;flavors&quot; of 19 per octave, exciting as that is... where the<br/>tuning differences are subtle, at best (surprise, surprise.)</p><p>The point is, one cannot easily &quot;substitute&quot; one hexany tuning for<br/>another and still have the same composition!  It isn&apos;t just a different<br/>&quot;flavor,&quot; it&apos;s a WHOLE DIFFERENT PIECE!!</p><p>I have a question concerning &quot;degenerate&quot; hexanies, which are my<br/>favorite ;-).  Why are they called &quot;degenerate?&quot;  Is it because the<br/>ratios don&apos;t quite work out to small numbers.  I&apos;m thinking of the<br/>example:</p><p><a href="http://1.3.11.33">1.3.11.33</a> Hexany, degenerate pentatonic form<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth<br/>  2:         11/8             551.318 undecimal semi-augmented fourth<br/>  3:         16/11            648.682 undecimal semi-diminished fifth<br/>  4:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/>  5:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>I guess that would make sense, with the &quot;semi-diminished fifth&quot; and so<br/>forth, the &quot;traditional&quot; pentatonic from the pythagorean having smaller<br/>ratios... (that is except for the 27/16!)</p><p>Please explain &quot;degeneracy&quot; to me.  This is something I need to know<br/>about quickly.</p><p>Finally, (thank god you say) how are the larger 12-note &quot;hexanies&quot;<br/>derived from the &quot;regular&quot; 6-note patterns??</p><p>Lets take Scala &quot;hexanys.scl&quot;:</p><p>|<br/>Hexanys 1 3 5 7 9<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         35/32            155.140 septimal neutral second<br/>  2:          9/8             203.910 major whole tone<br/>  3:          5/4             386.314 major third<br/>  4:         21/16            470.781 narrow fourth<br/>  5:         45/32            590.224 tritone<br/>  6:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/>  7:        105/64            857.095 septimal neutral sixth<br/>  8:         27/16            905.865 Pythagorean major sixth<br/>  9:          7/4             968.826 harmonic seventh<br/> 10:         15/8            1088.269 classic major seventh<br/> 11:         63/32           1172.736 octave - septimal comma<br/> 12:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>How are we (ahem, I mean some of you) getting this from the basic 6 note<br/>patterning.</p><p>As usual, any help and the usual patience are greatly appreciated!</p><p>______________ _______ ____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=10696 href="#10696">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2000 3:33:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&gt; I have a question concerning &quot;degenerate&quot; hexanies, which are my<br/>&gt; favorite ;-).

This is something I need to know<br/>&gt; about quickly.</p><p>It&apos;s degenerate because it doesn&apos;t have six notes -- it only has<br/>five!<br/>The reason is that of the six possible ways to take the factors two<br/>at<br/>a time, two are identical: 1*33 = 3*11.</p><p>The notes of the hexany are<br/>1*3<br/>1*11<br/>1*33<br/>3*11<br/>3*33<br/>11*33<br/>Let&apos;s choose 3*11 as the 1/1. So we divide by 33 (and throw in powers<br/>of two to get the scale within one octave) and get</p><p>16/11<br/>4/3<br/>1/1<br/>1/1<br/>3/2<br/>11/8</p><p>So the &quot;hexany&quot; has two instances of 1/1 -- it&apos;s degenerate, and<br/>really a 5-note scale.</p></div>
