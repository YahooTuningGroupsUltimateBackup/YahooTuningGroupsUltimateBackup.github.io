The meantone fifth goes full cycle and<br/>produces very accurate notation for 4:5:6:7. Principal Rast scale maps to<br/>natural keys. Pythagorean common pitches are finely represented. Each degree<br/>is half a &quot;comma&quot; large. Nicely resonating superpythagorean fifths are<br/>everywhere. The system has fine enough resolution for such superparticular<br/>ratios as 10:9, 11:10, 12:11, 13:12, 14:13, 15:14, 16:15. The worst are 6:5,<br/>11:10 and 16:15 with about 5 cents error. Transpositions are seamless<br/>though.</p><p>These were the pros. What may be the cons?</p><p>I can come up with the first one already: How are we to implement it to an<br/>&quot;actual&quot; instrument?</p><p>The second problem is the size of the limma. Two of them does not make a<br/>minor tone! One needs to alterate between 8 and 9 steps (86 and 96 cents<br/>respectively).</p><p>Now, how can I notate (Sagittal or otherwise) the scale by making the<br/>generator the meantone fifth in SCALA?</p><p>George?

I suspect that there&apos;s a bug in Scala that<br/>doesn&apos;t allow native-5th notations for divisions &gt;99, i.e., having<br/>more than 2 digits.</p><p>A brief explanation of this 112-edo symbol set is in order.  This is<br/>basically an extended meantone notation (as Gene suggested), very<br/>similar to the 31-ET notation for the 11 limit, where the 11M-diesis<br/>(32:33) symbol is used for both the 11M-diesis and 7-comma<br/>alterations.  A 4:5:6:7 chord on C may therefore be notated as either<br/>C,E,G,A# or C,E,G,Bb\!/ .</p><p>However, note that, because the 11M-diesis (5deg) is not exactly half<br/>as many degrees as the apotome (9deg), there must be two 11-diesis<br/>symbols, so you must take care to use the proper one.  If you&apos;re<br/>altering upward from a nominal to get an otonal 11 relationship, then<br/>the /|\ symbol is used, but if it&apos;s downward, then the (!) symbol is<br/>used.  For example, 8:11 on C is C,F/|\, whereas on F it&apos;s F,B(!) .<br/>This also affects the way you notate the 7-comma; e.g., 4:5:6:7 on G<br/>will be either G,B,D,F(!) or G,B,D,E#.  The utonal 11&apos;s work the<br/>opposite way: e.g., 16/11 of C is G\!/, whereas 16/11 of B is F(|) .<br/>This applies to *all tunings* where the 11M diesis is *not exactly<br/>half* the size of the apotome, for both temperaments and (always) JI.</p><p>The /|) and (|\ symbols must be interpreted as 13M and 13L dieses<br/>(1024:1053 and 26:27), respectively, not as 35M and 35L (35:36 and<br/>8192:8505, their primary roles), so in order for the lines to be<br/>completely correct, those two symbols should have right accents, like<br/>this:</p><p>n 112 65<br/>~|(  /|).  (|)  /|\  (|\&apos;  (N(  /N\</p><p>Examples of instances where  &quot;completely correct&quot; interpretation of<br/>the symbols has significance is 1) when extreme pitch precision is<br/>required, or 2) when transferring the symbols for playback in another<br/>temperament (where 35M and 13M could be different numbers of degrees).</p><p>But since Dave and I haven&apos;t yet worked with Manuel to implement<br/>right-accents adequately in Scala, the unaccented symbols will have<br/>to do for now.</p><p>The ~|( symbol is valid as the 17-comma, so this meantone-notation<br/>for 112 is actually 17-limit!

I figured that, since the<br/>considerable error of 5:7 in pajara is a constant (~17.488 cents,<br/>independent of the size of the generator), it&apos;s therefore not<br/>possible to avoid its the adverse effect of its contribution to the<br/>total 7-limit error, no matter how you calculate it.  So I&apos;ve<br/>accepted the fact that 7-limit chords won&apos;t sound anywhere near as<br/>consonant in pajara as they do in 31-ET and have concluded that the<br/>optimal pajara generator should be the one that minimizes the 5-limit<br/>errors while limiting the absolute error of each 7-limit consonance<br/>to no more than the 5:7 error.  This is accomplished with a generator<br/>of ~106.843c, which makes 4:5 just.  Now if you&apos;re thinking of going<br/>up to the 9- or 11-limit, there&apos;s very good news: all 11-limit<br/>consonances are also within the 5:7 error.  (In 22-ET, by contrast,<br/>the max error is progressively exceeded at *both* the 9 and 11<br/>limits, and its approximation of 9:11, in particular, leaves much to<br/>be desired.)</p><p>Several years ago Paul confronted me with the problem that, because I<br/>wouldn&apos;t be able to find a 7-limit minimax generator for pajara on<br/>account of that constant 5:7 error, I would have to use some other<br/>method to find an optimal generator for pajara.  I finally have an<br/>answer for him, and it&apos;s significantly different from what he<br/>advocates.</p><p>The 56-ET pajara generator (~107.143c) is very close to the optimal<br/>figure given above, and it also results in a pajara tuning in which<br/>the consonances do not exceed the 5:7 error at the 11-limit.</p><p>However, if 56 is too many tones for you, and if you want a pajara-<br/>capable tuning that offers free modulation, then consider the<br/>following.  I was curious to see what I would get when I combined two<br/>circles of my 17-tone well-temperament 600 cents apart.  I was<br/>delighted to discover that the 16 best 4:5:6:7 chords of the<br/>resulting 34-WT are produced by a two chains of generators of<br/>~107.220c (very close to the pajara-56-ET figure), and that all<br/>sixteen 11-limit otonal hexads (4:5:6:7:9:11) built on the same<br/>starting tones are such that no consonance exceeds the above-<br/>mentioned 5:7 error.

I found, much to my surprise, that a narrow-5th notation<br/>&gt; actually works quite well.

I suspect that there&apos;s a bug in Scala that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t allow native-5th notations for divisions &gt;99, i.e., having<br/>&gt; more than 2 digits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A brief explanation of this 112-edo symbol set is in order.  This is<br/>&gt; basically an extended meantone notation (as Gene suggested), very<br/>&gt; similar to the 31-ET notation for the 11 limit, where the 11M-diesis<br/>&gt; (32:33) symbol is used for both the 11M-diesis and 7-comma<br/>&gt; alterations.  A 4:5:6:7 chord on C may therefore be notated as either<br/>&gt; C,E,G,A# or C,E,G,Bb\!/ .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, note that, because the 11M-diesis (5deg) is not exactly half<br/>&gt; as many degrees as the apotome (9deg), there must be two 11-diesis<br/>&gt; symbols, so you must take care to use the proper one.  If you&apos;re<br/>&gt; altering upward from a nominal to get an otonal 11 relationship, then<br/>&gt; the /|\ symbol is used, but if it&apos;s downward, then the (!) symbol is<br/>&gt; used.  For example, 8:11 on C is C,F/|\, whereas on F it&apos;s F,B(!) .<br/>&gt; This also affects the way you notate the 7-comma; e.g., 4:5:6:7 on G<br/>&gt; will be either G,B,D,F(!) or G,B,D,E#.  The utonal 11&apos;s work the<br/>&gt; opposite way: e.g., 16/11 of C is G\!/, whereas 16/11 of B is F(|) .<br/>&gt; This applies to *all tunings* where the 11M diesis is *not exactly<br/>&gt; half* the size of the apotome, for both temperaments and (always) JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The /|) and (|\ symbols must be interpreted as 13M and 13L dieses<br/>&gt; (1024:1053 and 26:27), respectively, not as 35M and 35L (35:36 and<br/>&gt; 8192:8505, their primary roles), so in order for the lines to be<br/>&gt; completely correct, those two symbols should have right accents, like<br/>&gt; this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; n 112 65<br/>&gt; ~|(  /|).  (|)  /|\  (|\&apos;  (N(  /N\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Examples of instances where  &quot;completely correct&quot; interpretation of<br/>&gt; the symbols has significance is 1) when extreme pitch precision is<br/>&gt; required, or 2) when transferring the symbols for playback in another<br/>&gt; temperament (where 35M and 13M could be different numbers of degrees).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But since Dave and I haven&apos;t yet worked with Manuel to implement<br/>&gt; right-accents adequately in Scala, the unaccented symbols will have<br/>&gt; to do for now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The ~|( symbol is valid as the 17-comma, so this meantone-notation<br/>&gt; for 112 is actually 17-limit!  For example, a 10:12:14:17 diminished-<br/>&gt; 7th chord would be notated E,G,Bb\!/,Db~|( .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz, please give this a try.  If you like it, we might also try a wide-<br/>&gt; 5th notation (observing that the best 5th of 56-ET allows a nice<br/>&gt; implementation of pajara, with 11 thrown in for good measure).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=68120 href="#68120">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

There&apos;s<br/>virtually<br/>&gt; no difference in the amount of tempering at the 9-limit among<br/>&gt; those &quot;best pajara&quot; keys, so there would be no point in replicating<br/>&gt; examples &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; for any of those.  Instead, I&apos;ve prepared an<br/>&gt; example typical of one of those 18 other keys, one degree lower in<br/>&gt; pitch than the 34-WT example:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Pajara-34ITa.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Pajara-34ITa.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Pajara-34ITb.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Pajara-34ITb.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Pajara-34ITc.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Pajara-34ITc.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (I didn&apos;t know exactly what to call this intonation, so I<br/>&gt; used &quot;IT&quot; -- for ill-tempered. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At last!

Also, there&apos;s a very important<br/>pending microtonal commitment that I&apos;ve let go for too long, so I&apos;ll<br/>be going into lurk mode for a while after posting this.</p><p>First, I want to say &quot;thank you&quot; for your very helpful comments.  As<br/>a follow-up to my 17-tone paper (for which I had to draw heavily on<br/>my own observations and opinions), I hope to write a 34-tone paper in<br/>the near future.  This will be a new chapter in my speculative wide-<br/>fifth alternate tuning history, in which the 17-tone octave is<br/>subdivided into sixth-tones to arrive at a 34-tone system that<br/>introduces primes 5 and 17 into the mix.  Since the pajara scale<br/>plays a prominent role in the tonal organization of 34, it will be<br/>necessary to provide evidence for my observation that 34-ET and/or 34-<br/>WT are not only &quot;better&quot; tunings for pajara than 22-ET, but that<br/>they&apos;re good enough to justify the additional number of tones (at<br/>both the 7 and 9 limits, and especially at the 11 limit).</p><p>Since this is in conflict with a conclusion that Paul Erlich made in<br/>his 22-tone paper (which, especially now, would more accurately be<br/>called his &apos;pajara paper&apos;), it would be presumptuous of me to<br/>challenge that conclusion solely on the basis of my own subjective<br/>observations and opinion.  It&apos;s very good, therefore, that I&apos;m now<br/>able to say that my tuning evaluations are supported by a half-dozen<br/>fellow microtonalists, who are virtually unanimous in putting 22-ET<br/>in last place (offering such descriptions as &quot;really bad&quot;, &quot;which I<br/>hated&quot;, &quot;worst of all&quot;, and &quot;cheesey&quot;, to take a few choice words out<br/>of context ;-).  Fortunately, this does not invalidate the main<br/>content of Paul&apos;s brilliant paper, which I will continue to regard as<br/>a major theoretical development in the quest for new organizing<br/>principles for tonality.</p><p>Getting back to the survey: your opinions are summarized by the<br/>following comments:</p><p>Magnus Jonsson (MMM #15265):  I&apos;d take the JI versions if I could,<br/>but I know that&apos;s against the rules here so I&apos;ll pick 34WT as next<br/>best.</p><p>Carl Lumma (#62899):  I would say 34 based on this [sets A and B].<br/>(#68328):  Overall, I&apos;d say 34 perhaps earns its keep, but 56 does<br/>not.</p><p>Cameron Bobro (#68301):  Another vote for 34, specicially the WT.</p><p>Gene Ward Smith (#68312):  34-WT and 56 are close, trailed by 34 and<br/>22.</p><p>Herman Miller (#68325):  I&apos;ll vote for the 34-ET version.</p><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz (#68382):  All sound better in your 34WT than any<br/>other approximations to the JI originals.  The 22-EDO versions are<br/>(at least equal) worst of all.  The other two versions are mostly<br/>better than 22-EDO and worse than 34-WT.</p><p>And here&apos;s how I voted:  34-WT (best keys), then 56-ET, then 34-ET,<br/>then 34-IT (worst keys of 34-WT), then 22-ET.</p><p>Now for some numbers:  Since the pajara period is fixed at 600 cents,<br/>pajara tunings may be defined and compared solely in terms of the<br/>specific generator, from which the errors of the various odd harmonic<br/>factors may be calculated (in descending order of generator size):</p><p>     Generator  Error (cents)<br/>Tuning cents   3    5     7     9     11   13   17<br/>------ -----  ---- ---- ----- ----- ----- ---- ----<br/>22-ET  109.1  +7.1 Â–4.5 +13.0 +14.3  -5.9  --  +4.1<br/>34-WT  107.2  +5.3 Â–0.8 +16.7 +10.5   varies*  +2.3<br/>56-ET  107.1  +5.2 Â–0.6 +16.9 +10.4  +5.8 Â–4.8 +2.2<br/>34-ET  105.9  +3.9 +1.9 +19.4  +7.9 +13.3 +6.5 +0.9<br/>34-IT  104.4  +2.4 +4.9 +22.4  +4.8   varies*  -0.6</p><p>*In 34-WT the error of 11 varies from 5.4 to 16.7 cents in the best<br/>keys (34-WT), and from 11.0 to 22.4 cents in the worst keys (34-IT);<br/>for any given key it will always be within the range of the 3 and 7<br/>errors.  The error of 13 varies from 0.2 to 14.4 cents in the best<br/>keys (34-WT), and from -5.5 to 17.2 cents in the worst keys (34-IT).</p><p>Observe that the error of 5:7 (+17.5c) is constant across all of the<br/>above tunings.  This is due to the 600-cent period, which differs<br/>from 5:7 by that amount.  Notice also that in 34-ET, and also in the<br/>worst keys of 34-WT (34-IT), the error of 7 exceeds that of 5:7,<br/>which is an indication that their generators are outside of the<br/>optimal range.  The specific advantage of 34-ET, therefore, is its<br/>excellent 5-limit properties.</p><p>I evaluated 56-ET as an open-ended pajara tuning, without regard to<br/>the total number of tones in the ET, much as one might evaluate 1/4-<br/>comma meantone as being preferable to 12-ET and 19-ET (and I believe<br/>that this is also how Gene was thinking of it).  Carl, I infer that<br/>your opinion that 56 does not earn its keep was due much more to the<br/>number of tones in the ET than to the sound of the tuning, yes?<br/>Graham Breed mentioned to me off-list (prior to my preparing these<br/>tuning examples) that the optimal Tenney-weighted RMS pajara<br/>generator is close to that of 56-ET, so there are some good numbers<br/>to support 56-ET.</p><p>Since some will think that 56-ET is too many tones (i.e., not enough<br/>of an improvement over 34-ET to justify the increase), then 34-WT (in<br/>its 16 best keys) may be a more practical alternative that also<br/>offers a very decent representation of prime 13 (inherited from 17-<br/>WT).  I constructed 34-WT earlier this year by placing two circles of<br/>my 17-WT (designed in 1978, before anyone had ever heard of pajara)<br/>600 cents apart, and it was only by chance that this resulted in a<br/>pajara tuning that&apos;s virtually the same as 56-ET.
