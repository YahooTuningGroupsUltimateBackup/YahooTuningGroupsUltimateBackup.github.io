However, since the Haba did not make use of the great consonance<br/>&gt; possibilities of 31ET, a performance in 30ET might not be losing very much!<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul, I think you&apos;re correct. The piece is announced as being in fifth-tone<br/>system. I translated the information simply into 30ET to respect the<br/>vocabulary generally used on this list. In fact, that doesn&apos;t correspond to<br/>reality. I listened to a CD with the interpretation of this String Quartet<br/>by the Suk Quartet. It&apos;s defintely not 30ET but more a normal diatonic<br/>system in which some notes are expressively sharpened or lowered by a fifth<br/>tone. I do not possess the score, so I can&apos;t tell how &apos;accurate&apos; the<br/>interpretation is. However, one clearly appreciates some pure fifths (open<br/>strings) and harmonies based upon thirds and sixths, which is in<br/>contradiction with 30ET. On the concert which I announced the piece will be<br/>played by the Stamic Quartet. I&apos;ll ask them about it. Be welcome to transmit<br/>some questions!</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
