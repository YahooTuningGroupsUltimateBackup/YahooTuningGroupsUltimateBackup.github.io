I think that would be the absolute best solution. My<br/>dream-world solution is have a program that pops up with 88 text boxes and lets me<br/>enter cents values for every note on the keyboard to the nearest hundredth. These<br/>scales could then be saved as presets and loaded at will. My friend tells me that such<br/>a program might already exist for Max/MSP as a stand-alone application.
