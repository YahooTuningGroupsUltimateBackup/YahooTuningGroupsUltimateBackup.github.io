I beam in the belfry is inscribed &quot;James Harrison 1759&quot;.</p><p>It seems that this James was the brother of John &quot;Longitude&quot;, and these bells were hung about 15 years before Harrison&apos;s final manuscript on the manufacturing methods for bells was written.</p><p>On Saturday I went to an interesting event in Newbury England, to learn more about the manufacturing and tuning of traditional church bells.</p><p><a href="http://www.ringingroadshow2005.org.uk/">http://www.ringingroadshow2005.org.uk/</a></p><p>There are now two main bell foundries remaining in England;</p><p><a href="http://www.whitechapelbellfoundry.co.uk/">http://www.whitechapelbellfoundry.co.uk/</a><br/><a href="http://www.taylorbells.co.uk/">http://www.taylorbells.co.uk/</a></p><p>I also met Nigel Taylor from Whitechapel, who seems to be the main UK authority on their tuning.<br/>His site explains how he thinks about tuning and gives some insights into the tuning methods he uses.</p><p><a href="http://www.kirnberger.fsnet.co.uk/">http://www.kirnberger.fsnet.co.uk/</a></p><p>I hope to learn more by meeting with representatives from both foundries to explore the details of Harrison&apos;s last manuscript, and discover more about what his instructions may mean.</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a><br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div>
