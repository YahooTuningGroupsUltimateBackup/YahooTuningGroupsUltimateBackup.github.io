The<br/>&gt; first, harmonic use, which you mention, refers to the voicings or<br/>&gt; positions of a chord: for example &quot;root&quot; or 1st position = tonic in the<br/>&gt; basss (5/3), 2nd position = third in the bass (6/3), 3rd position =<br/>&gt; fifth in the bass (6/4).  The second, equally legitimate usage, is more<br/>&gt; associated with melodic uses, and original with answers in imitative<br/>&gt; counterpoint. Answers are distinguished between real (the intervals are<br/>&gt; inverted exactly) or tonal (the contour is generally maintained, but<br/>&gt; intervals are adjusted to accommodate the tonal environment).  Real<br/>&gt; answer becomes especially important in atonal and 12-tone contexts<br/>&gt; (where interchangeability between melodic and chordal material is also<br/>&gt; essential), but there are plenty of examples of real imitation to be<br/>&gt; heard in earlier repertoire as well: not only Partch was fond of chordal<br/>&gt; inversion at the 1/1 (To hell with it, I&apos;m going to walk! 1/1 O7 - 1/1<br/>U7).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DJW</p><p>Spot on, Daniel!  This is exactly the way I learned it<br/>(in Australia) in the 1950s and 1960s.  &quot;Real&quot; and<br/>&quot;tonal&quot; [melodic] answers lead naturally to &quot;real&quot;<br/>and &quot;tonal&quot; [melodic] inversions.  This is the basic<br/>language in (British) English of counterpoint.  The<br/>assumption, before Schoenberg, was that the answers<br/>and inversions would usually be diatonic (preserving<br/>key or mode), and after him, that it might be exact<br/>(preserving the chromatic intervals).</p><p>And yes, we also say that chords are in root position,<br/>first inversion or second inversion.  Personally, I much<br/>prefer to call these instead the first, second and third<br/>positions as you have done, since doing so means that<br/>&quot;inversion&quot; is entirely in the melodic realm and &quot;position&quot;<br/>is entirely in the harmonic realm.  Although I know what<br/>first inversion is, I think of it as a transposition of one<br/>chord member to another position, not as an inversion.<br/>Of course, when scribbling down harmonies, it&apos;s often<br/>much quicker to use the figured bass notation for the<br/>different positions, eg of the chord of the subdominant:</p><p>..... IV ....... IV 6 ............ IV 6<br/>..................................................... 4</p><p>where the default 5s and 3s of first (5 over 3) and<br/>second (6 over 3) positions are not shown; full version:</p><p>..... IV 5 ....... IV 6 ............ IV 6<br/>............. 3............... 3 .................... 4</p><p>Gene Ward Smith replied to Daniel:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Answers are distinguished between real (the intervals are<br/>&gt; &gt; inverted exactly) or tonal (the contour is generally maintained, but<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals are adjusted to accommodate the tonal environment).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is the vocabulary of &quot;real&quot; and &quot;tonal&quot; common in English? I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; &quot;mirror inversion&quot; for &quot;real&quot;.</p><p>Yes, Gene, that&apos;s been British music practice for<br/>a very long time.  I have an English book on music<br/>theory from the 19th Century, and some Australian<br/>ones from mid-20th century, with the same usage.</p><p>Jeremy Targett replied:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jeremy Targett&quot; &lt;jeremy.targett@...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just finished saying that musicians don&apos;t use this definition of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inversion. Am I wrong?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you&apos;d be wrong about that. It&apos;s the standard term, from Bach<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fugue subjects to Schoenberg&apos;s rows.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since Schoenberg&apos;s rows involve pitch classes, not pitches, I wonder<br/>&gt; &gt; if you understood what I&apos;m asking. When people talk about Bach<br/>&gt; &gt; inverting a fugue subject, do they always require a strict mirror<br/>&gt; &gt; inversion, sending major to minor and vice versa?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An inversion of a Bach fugue subject is usually diatonic, not exact.<br/>&gt; So some kind of ascending third gets mapped to some kind of descending<br/>&gt; third, major or minor. This doesn&apos;t matter in that it is still a<br/>&gt; *reflective* inversion rather than a *permutation*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 12-tone practice the reflective inversion is exact, because you are<br/>&gt; operating in a universe of 12 tones rather than 7 diatonic tones. You<br/>&gt; could think of the diatonic inversion in Bach as being exact within<br/>&gt; the realm of the seven diatonic notes. Here is an example, from WTCI:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; original subject: Eb-Bb-Cb-Bb-Ab-Gb-Ab-Bb-Eb-Ab-Gb-F-Eb<br/>&gt; inversion, which first appears in the bass about halfway through the<br/>piece:<br/>&gt; Bb-Eb-D-Eb-F-Gb-F-Eb-Bb-Eb-F-Gn-Ab<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; contour is preserved (up to reflection), i.e. this is a reflection in<br/>&gt; pitch, not just pitch-class space. It is an exact inversion in<br/>&gt; diatonic space, and a less strict inversion in chromatic space. Some<br/>&gt; theorists refer to these as &quot;generically exact&quot; and &quot;specifically<br/>&gt; inexact&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The distinction between &quot;tonal&quot; and &quot;real&quot; is a different one in<br/>&gt; traditional counterpoint theory. A &quot;real&quot; answer to the subject above<br/>&gt; would start:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bb-F-Gb-F-Eb-Db-Eb-F...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but a &quot;tonal&quot; answer, which Bach uses in this piece and roughly half<br/>&gt; the time in WTC, goes like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bb-Eb-Gb-F-Eb-Db-Eb-F...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i.e. you are permitted to answer &quot;1-5&quot; by &quot;5-1&quot;, exchanging 4ths for<br/>&gt; 5ths. Bach does this when he is still in the tonic at the entrance of<br/>&gt; the second voice. If he has modulated to V for the entrance of the 2nd<br/>&gt; voice, he will use a real answer. Here he is still in Eb minor at the<br/>&gt; entrance of the 2nd voice, and Bb-F wouldn&apos;t fit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Schoenberg&apos;s practice, you can be assured of a reflective inversion<br/>&gt; in 12-tone pitch-*class* space, but not in pitch-space--the contour is<br/>&gt; almost never preserved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Summing up, we have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; inversion can mean reflection or permutation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reflection can be in pitch space or pitch-class space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reflection can be exact (chromatic), as in Schoenberg, or diatonic, as in<br/>Bach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In specific baroque practices, a subject can be imitated (whether in<br/>&gt; inversion or &quot;right way up&quot;) *tonally* which is even looser than<br/>&gt; diatonic, in that 4ths can replace 5ths and vice-versa, in order to<br/>&gt; preserve key. &quot;Real&quot; vs &quot;tonal&quot; usually refer to a &quot;right-way-up&quot;<br/>&gt; imitation, but could also be used to refer to imitation by inversion<br/>&gt; when diatonic interval-classes are not preserved exactly.</p><p>Jeremy,</p><p>Thanks for a useful summary and example!</p><p>I&apos;d heard all these varieties before except for<br/>&quot;generically exact&quot; and &quot;specifically inexact&quot;.<br/>And that was no great loss, as they don&apos;t help<br/>much to clarify what&apos;s happening.</p><p>For my own use, I&apos;d like to slightly revise your<br/>summary as follows:</p><p>* Inversion can mean melodic reflection or<br/>chord-tone permutation.</p><p>* Reflection can be in pitch space or pitch-class<br/>space.</p><p>* Reflection can be exact (chromatic), as in<br/>Schoenberg, or diatonic, as in Bach.</p><p>* Diatonic reflection can be real (preserving<br/>diatonic intervals), or tonal (preserving key or<br/>mode).  This parallels real and tonal answers, which<br/>are unreflected, transposed repetitions.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
