The last one would be the octony instead<br/>of the hexany. Probably start a new page for that one and just follow the<br/>same general plan, and show the octony as a cube at the end. I could then<br/>go on and mention the way you can find the hexany also as a subset of the<br/>octony, and so lead into the CPS sets and the pascal triangle.</p><p>BTW I&apos;ve just done an update of the page mentioning the 1 3 7 9 hexany and the<br/>septimal minor chord. I was interested to find out that the septimal minor<br/>chord is actually an otonal chord, 3 7 9 in the harmonic series :-).</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/mus_geom/musical_geometry.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/mus_geom/musical_geometry.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2002 11:31:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; HI Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I can do a cubic lattice one too.

I haven&apos;t heard of the cubic lattice of chords,<br/>- sounds interesting, are there any web pages describing it?</p><p>Anyway someone else can maybe do it? I think perhaps some of these<br/>lattices that get posted to the TL would be really nice with musical<br/>clips so that you can actually hear what they sound like!</p><p>It&apos;s really easy to make this type of a page now with FTS<br/>- you just do all the file names in the page as the notes you want in<br/>the chord, e.g.</p><p>href=&quot;1/1 7/6 3/2.mid&quot; for the septimal minor (subminor) chord.</p><p>Then FTS will go through the page and make them all with a single click<br/>of a button. It changes them to url safe file names of course, this one to</p><p>href=&quot;1o1_7o6_3o2.mid&quot;</p><p>which FTS reads as the same chord.</p><p>That&apos;s all there is to it.</p><p>See Help | FAQ | Music Making | How do I use the feature to make midi clips<br/>for all the file names in a web page?<br/>- and you are best with the most recent update of FTS for this option, from:<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>So, most of the work is already done once you&apos;ve done the graphics :-).<br/>Well, you have to draw the clickable regions for the pictures, and you have<br/>to type in all the midi clip names, which can take a little while if you<br/>have lots of those to do.</p><p>As for the pictures, to make the type of picture where you click on a particular<br/>position to hear a note - you need a program to make / edit these types of clickable<br/>images (technically called client side image maps). I use Map This! which is<br/>freeware and an excellent tool:</p><p><a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/tools/ibmpc/mapthis">http://www.abdn.ac.uk/tools/ibmpc/mapthis</a><br/>when I got it, but I think it is now shareware.</p><p>With some types of set ups then you get taken to a new page when you click on<br/>the picture. This page of course works best if you have the set up where<br/>the clip gets played in the background, and I&apos;ve added a note about that to<br/>it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2002 9:07:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul and Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the correction.

If we multiply all the notes of a (major or minor) JI tetrad together and ignore 2, we get a rational number</p><p>q = 3^a 5^b 7^c</p><p>which uniqely determines that chord. Transforming coordinates by using instead [(b+c-2)/4,(a+c-2)/4,(a+b-2)/4] exhibits the tetrads as a cubic lattice; every triple [a,b,c] corresponds to a tetrad, and two tetrads which share a common interval are one unit apart. If a+b+c<br/>is even, the tetrad is major, if odd, minor. The existence of this cubic lattice has to do with special facts about the lattice of notes in the 7-limit which do not obtain in other prime limits.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2002 12:51:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Exactly.
