For 1deg99, this is my recommendation:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; |~ as 243:245 (245C)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; |~ is also valid as 729:736 (23C) for 1deg99, which is the<br/>primary<br/>&gt; &gt; definition for the symbol.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Weeeell, I prefer<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~| as 1024:1029 (343k)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; also valid in primary role 2176:2187 (17k)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer ~| for 1deg99 because<br/>&gt; (a) it&apos;s in the subset of more commonly used symbols we<br/>&gt; call &quot;Athenian&quot;, and</p><p>Sorry -- it used to be, but not any more.  Anyway, |~ is in the<br/>trojan set.</p><p>&gt; (b) the left boathook (wavy flag) is also in the ~|) symbol for<br/>&gt; 3deg99 and so we minimise the number of different flags, and</p><p>True.</p><p>&gt; (c) once it is realised that in this tuning the 5-comma /| is also<br/>&gt; the 7-comma |) (but the symbol for the lower prime takes<br/>precedence)<br/>&gt; then one can see 1 + 2 = 3 in ~| + /| = ~|)</p><p>Good observation.  Okay, I&apos;ll consider this.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For 5deg99 I found these:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;(/| as 392:405 (5:49M)<br/>&gt; &gt; .(|\ as 27:28 (7L)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;(/| happens to be (IMO) the most obvious symbol to notate a hemi-<br/>&gt; &gt; fifth, but .(|\ (27:28) is a more popular ratio.  The trouble<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; these is that they&apos;re both accented symbols, and Dave has<br/>indicated<br/>&gt; &gt; (on several occasions) that he doesn&apos;t want to use any accented<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols to notate divisions lower than about 300.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still feel that way. Because what happens when you have only one<br/>&gt; accented symbol? The accent gets dropped.</p><p>What do you mean by this?  Is this some sort of rule you came up<br/>with?  Or do you mean that it would often be overlooked by a sloppy<br/>or inattentive (i.e., typical) user?</p><p>&gt; And you&apos;re left with an<br/>&gt; invalid symbol.</p><p>True.  But let&apos;s look at the alternative:</p><p>&gt; &gt;  If no reasonable<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative can be found, then I can&apos;t see any way to avoid<br/>this.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been willing to allow it as long as there are not two<br/>symbols in<br/>&gt; &gt; the same set differing only by an accent mark, which would *not<br/>&gt; &gt; require* the player to *read* the accents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although 99-ET isn&apos;t 11-limit consistent, I think the boy who told<br/>&gt; the Emperor he had no clothes would tell us to use the arrow /|\<br/>and<br/>&gt; be done with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s needed is a semisharp symbol and /|\ has been a semisharp<br/>&gt; symbol for a lot longer than it has been an 11-diesis symbol, and<br/>of<br/>&gt; course both predate sagittal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can just weasel on the 11 limit interpretation because it&apos;s at<br/>&gt; least valid for notating a 6:11 even though not an 8:11 or a 9:11.</p><p>In other words, it&apos;s okay to use a symbol that&apos;s valid 1/3 of the<br/>time, but not one that&apos;s completely invalid?

Therefore, one can define up to 65536 accidentals _only for sharp_ (^). Taking in account ^ and _ (__, ^^ and = are also valid, though), we have: 2 * 65536 = _131072_ accidentals.</p><p>However, even if one can actually *define* such a huge number of different accidentals, currently abcm2ps allows to *use* up to _32_ microtonal accidentals in a single piece of music (common accidendals ^ ^^ = _ __ are not taken in account).</p><p>(One can have several pieces in a single ABC file, and it is possible to redefine the accidentals inside a piece.)</p><p>Therefore, having available 32 accidentals, one can divide a whole tone in _32_ parts *without* use enharmonic notes (the common ^ ^^ = _ __ are still available, then the total can be actually 37 parts).</p><p>But lets suppose one wants to use 16 sharp accidentals plus 16 flat accidentals:</p><p>=C  ^1/C  ^2/C  ^3/C  ^4/C  ...  ^15/C  ^16/C  =D<br/>=C _16/D _15/D _14/D _13/D  ...   _2/D   _1/D  =D</p><p>One can notate this way, for instance, an ET with 17 degrees for a whole tone, plus, to say, 11 degrees for a semitone:</p><p>2*11 + 5*17 = 22 + 85 = 107 ET</p><p>The maximum number of divisions depends upon the use of commons accidentals ^, ^^, _ and __ (providing 4 more divisions a of a whole tone) and the number of steps defined for a semitone.</p><p>The difficult part, then, doesn&apos;t lie in abcm2ps microtone limitations (it is free software, one can just increase the value for the MAXMICRO in &grave;abcparse.c&apos; and make a few more needed adjusts), but in the music to be notated instead. For instance, clusters like</p><p>[=C^/C^C_/D=D^D]</p><p>will be a pain in the neck to adjust graphically, independently of the used music notation program, even to notate by hand in a paper.</p><p>If someone have an algorithm to optimize the relative positions of the noteheads (and accidentals) for such complex clusters and chords, let me know, or send it directly to Jean-Fran&iuml;&iquest;&half;ois Moine (abcm2ps&apos; maintainer).

And all the glyphs now have proper postscript names. Nothing<br/>else has changed, so anyone who is sucessfully using the previous<br/>versions does not need to update them.</p><p>Please let me know if you have any other problems converting them to<br/>postscript. And as I mentioned before, I&apos;d be happy to put up the<br/>converted files (and anything else that might help people to use<br/>them) on the Sagittal website, with acknowledgement of your<br/>contribution.</p><p>About the two different files SagittalSAT.ttf and Sagittal72.ttf:</p><p>They both contain the font called &quot;Sagittal&quot; so you can only install<br/>one of them at a time. They are both subsets of a larger set whose<br/>details have not yet been finalised. The same glyphs have the same<br/>character-codes or mappings in all of these files. We have files<br/>with different subsets to make it easier for people who don&apos;t need<br/>the less common symbols, to find the glyphs they need.</p><p>SagittalSAT.ttf is a subset containing the union of the subsets<br/>described in our Xenharmonikon paper as Spartan, Athenian and Trojan.</p><p>Sagittal72.ttf contains only those symbols needed to notate 72-ET (a<br/>subset of the Spartan set). These also notate many common ETs below<br/>72, 5-odd-limit JI and harmonics to the 12th.</p><p>To notate the musical example in the paper you will need the full<br/>Spartan set and so you will need to use the SagittalSAT.ttf file.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
