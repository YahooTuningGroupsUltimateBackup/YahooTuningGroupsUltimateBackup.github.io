Thanks also for the concept of<br/>graylessness. If I may paraphrase:</p><p>An n-tET (n-EDO) is grayless at the m-limit if all m-limit ratios are no<br/>further than a quarter step (+-1/4n of an octave) away from some degree of<br/>the n-tET. This is equivalent to being Hahn level 2 consistent at the m-limit.</p><p>Is that all correct?</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; The lowest &quot;gray-less&quot; ETs for various odd limits are:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; odd limit      ET<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  7             31<br/>&gt;&gt;  9             41<br/>&gt;&gt; 11             72<br/>&gt;&gt; 13            270<br/>&gt;&gt; 15            494<br/>&gt;&gt; 17           3395<br/>&gt;&gt; 19-21        8539</p><p>So it&apos;s:</p><p> odd limit      ET<br/>  3              2<br/>  5              3</p><p>I see now why you left them off.</p><p>So these are the only ETs worth basing JI notation systems on? 72 is<br/>definitely a winner. Rather than call them 1/12th-tones, could we call them<br/>sextants? If 1/100th of a semitone is a cent then 1/6th of a semitone is a<br/>sextant.</p><p>David Finnamore replied:</p><p>&gt;Oh, yeah.  I had an uncle once who worked exclusively in 8,539 EDO.<br/>&gt;The guy was nuts about the 21 limit.  &quot;Gray-less?&quot; he used to say,<br/>&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t know from grayless!&quot;  He had a special 61,908 note<br/>&gt;keyboard built for it.  Since his fingers were 79 feet long, with<br/>&gt;tips no more than a millimeter in circumference, this was not a<br/>&gt;problem.  As long as he kept his nails clipped. ;-)</p><p>Thanks for a good laugh David. It does rather point up the ridiculousness<br/>of claiming that some piece is &gt;15 limit JI. Who could tell?

Eh?</p><p>It&apos;s not the music that&apos;s non-linear. It&apos;s what is between the oscillators<br/>and the listener, mostly the listeners ears. Apparently, &quot;non-linear&quot; means<br/>something different to you than it does to me.</p><p>A non-linear function f of a single variable x is one that cannot be<br/>represented as f(x) = mx + c, where m and c are arbitrary (complex)<br/>constants. e.g. f(x) = x^2 or f(x) = e^x.</p><p>But you don&apos;t need to understand the maths. The important point is (as has<br/>been explained many times by Paul Erlich and others) that a collection of<br/>sine waves passing through a non-linear medium produce new sine waves at<br/>frequencies which are the sum and difference of integer multiples of the<br/>original frequencies. This doesn&apos;t happen with a linear medium. The<br/>amplitudes of these various combination tones depends on the exact nature<br/>of the non-linearity. Another name for non-linearity is &quot;distortion&quot;.</p><p>Very few things in the real world are linear, but many are approximately<br/>linear. With sound, one can get some idea if a non-linear effect is<br/>involved by turning down the volume. If the effect diminishes rapidly as<br/>you turn down the volume, chances are it&apos;s due to non-linearity, whether in<br/>the equipment or your ear.</p><p>I imagine that listening to the Dream House output at low levels, mixed<br/>down to a set of headphones, would be completely pointless.

I&apos;m personally more<br/>interested in the lower levels of the physics and psychology of music,<br/>which I have some chance of mathematically modelling. But there&apos;s no doubt<br/>that such things as hero-worship do come into the appreciation of all art.</p><p>I&apos;m only trying to point out a distinction that I think has gone largely<br/>unrecognised.</p><p>The term &quot;just intonation&quot; is being used to describe two very different<br/>phenomena, but they do blur into one another.</p><p>What I think of as &quot;historical&quot; JI is the elimination of beating and the<br/>minimisation of roughness of chords that is due to partials not coinciding<br/>closely enough or not being far enough apart (critical band or harmonic<br/>entropy theory). This assumes timbres with significant amounts of partials<br/>and is just as important at low volume levels as at high. Chords only need<br/>to be sustained for half a second to appreciate the effect.</p><p>Then there&apos;s this new stuff based on very precise large integer ratios and<br/>sine waves with long sustain. I&apos;m not sure what to call it.</p><p>Think about the original meaning of &quot;just intonation&quot;. As I understand it,<br/>it referred to taking a note in an underlying scale, which would remain<br/>melodically and harmonically intelligible despite variations in pitch of up<br/>to a comma, and &quot;justly intoning&quot; it, e.g. moving one&apos;s finger slightly on<br/>the violin, or altering the vocal pitch slightly, until the beats cancelled.</p><p>This idea doesn&apos;t seem to apply to the Dream House.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=15549 href="#15549">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2000 7:40:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15546">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15546</a></p><p>&gt; A non-linear function f of a single variable x is one that cannot be<br/>&gt; represented as f(x) = mx + c, where m and c are arbitrary (complex)<br/>&gt; constants. e.g. f(x) = x^2 or f(x) = e^x.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you don&apos;t need to understand the maths.

While this particular tuning is 100% &apos;rational&apos;,<br/>&gt; by my reasoning one could never call it &apos;JI&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the same time, however, one should be careful not to say<br/>&gt; that Dave B.&apos;s definition &apos;includes all possible tuning systems,<br/>&gt; including 12-tET&apos;.  I understand that your point is that the<br/>&gt; above tuning is aurally indistinguishable from 12-tET, but<br/>&gt; mathematically, it is *not* [exactly] the same as 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the sake of keeping the argument clear, you should have said<br/>&gt; something like &apos;includes scales that are aurally indistinguishable<br/>&gt; from all possible tunings, including 12-tET&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess the bottom line is that some [actually, most] folks<br/>&gt; (like Dave B.) don&apos;t care about distinctions that can&apos;t be heard,<br/>&gt; which I suppose is a point that can be reasonably defended as<br/>&gt; long as the tuning is under consideration specifically as it<br/>&gt; applies to *music*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But some of us (including me) are interested as well in other<br/>&gt; aspects of tuning that relate to domains other than music, in<br/>&gt; which case tiny distinctions like this can become important.</p><p>To which Paul Erlich responded:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15655">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15655</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would you mind giving an example or two of a domain other than<br/>&gt; music to which   &quot;tuning&quot;, as we discuss it on this list,<br/>&gt; relates?

The synths that will allow full<br/>keyboard retuning, I&apos;ll use more of the ratios. For that scale, the<br/>choices were mostly by taste. Actually, when I start out I have a<br/>list of about 500+ frequencies from the FFT. This list I sort by<br/>order of amplitude, then I generally choose the first 25-50 (although<br/>I have tried mapping the midi range with different ratios - giving<br/>non-octave scales usually) pitches from which to create the scales.<br/>This set of frequencies I will convert to cents and reduce within<br/>2/1, 4/1 or 8/1. It is always surprising to see the resulting ratios<br/>of an inharmonic sample - just a small slice of the chaos that&apos;s<br/>happening on the surface of an instrument vibrating from many<br/>directions. What you see there doesn&apos;t seem to obey the orderly logic<br/>of musical instruments with a *more* linear harmonic structure. Just<br/>for fun, I thought I&apos;d paste in the raw ratios from which the scale I<br/>posted was derived. You can see that there are some duplicate<br/>intervals and some that are so close to one another as to be<br/>indistinguishable. With so many close pitches, one must do a bit of<br/>sorting out - I guess that&apos;s when personal preference and taste steps<br/>in. My plan for the composition included a 24 part male choir, which<br/>my friend Richard Hunt impeccably performed. So I wanted to use this<br/>12 pitch scale as the &quot;singable&quot; portion (the choir part actually<br/>uses an octatonic scale with &quot;whole step-half step&quot; pattern). It<br/>wasn&apos;t easy to sing at first, but after we rehearsed it a few times,<br/>the tuning sank in (5 to 7 limit is easy to sing, but this was a<br/>challenge!). The metal drum plays an dominant rhythmic role, and<br/>provides a sort of inharmonic timbre chordal drone, and the choir is<br/>in it&apos;s tuning - it is a wonderful sound. I&apos;ve always fancied that<br/>the chosen tuning system, can or should somewhat dictate the<br/>idiomatic/stylistic approach of the composition. Working in this way,<br/>timbres become chords (or behave like chords) in the overall sound of<br/>the piece. So naturally one is compelled do some creative things with<br/>these rhythmic chordal effects. Nothing new really - most of the<br/>world does it by instinct. It is fascinating though to put<br/>timbres &quot;under the microscope&quot;, and mine out the scales there. It is<br/>a process that basically blew the lid off the Limits for me, as I<br/>used to have it easy in my nice cozy 31 Prime Limit world - now I&apos;m<br/>getting vertigo from these high number ratios - I need a parachute up<br/>here!</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>P.S.

This is certainly the right tuning for the minor triad in Renaissance<br/>music, before tonality developed. However, Xavier and others have a very negative reaction to<br/>pieces of _tonal_ music in a minor key ending on a 10:12:15 triad. This is because the implied<br/>fundamental is the submediant rather than the tonic. So a piece in A minor ending on a meantone<br/>or Just minor triad would sound sort of like it was tonicizing F, especially if the tuning was really<br/>accurate and the chord was loud enough for combination tones to be produced. Helmholtz<br/>shared these perceptions. A 16:19:24 minor triad, though, has all combination tones supporting<br/>the sensation of the root as fundamental -- in this case, they&apos;re all overtones of A -- so it makes<br/>for a more &quot;stable&quot; tonicization of the root. So, if the final chord of a piece in minor is to be played<br/>loud, with the tonic in the bass, you&apos;ll get a much more &quot;supportive&quot; tuning from 16:19:24 than<br/>from 10:12:15.</p><p>Note that, from a harmonic entropy standpoint, the voicing matters a great deal -- so a given<br/>voicing of a minor triad might be optimally tuned 1:4:12:19, rather than 5:20:60:96; while a<br/>different voicing might be better tuned 5:6:15 rather than 16:19:48 -- in both cases because the<br/>first voicing represents a much lower segment of the harmonic series and is thus much more<br/>recognizable as such.</p></div><h3><a id=15684 href="#15684">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/2000 9:05:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>P.S.

He was<br/>surprised to find out the actual ratios of the triads he had reacted to, but I wasn&apos;t -- since we&apos;ve<br/>been so acculturated to 12-tET, and the acoustical effects of the combination tones of a<br/>near-16:19:24 are so familiar, I had confidently predicted that Gerry and others would prefer the<br/>chords in the vicinity of 16:19:24 to those near 10:12:15.</p></div><h3><a id=15687 href="#15687">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>11/20/2000 8:42:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;PERLICH@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This set of frequencies I will convert to cents and reduce within<br/>&gt; &gt; 2/1, 4/1 or 8/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How can you justify this reduction if the timbre&apos;s partials don&apos;t<br/>repeat themselves at these octave<br/>&gt; ratios?

One usually sees the derivation of the partials of a<br/>round drumhead as the simplest<br/>&gt; example of an inharmonic spectrum.</p><p>I was being metaphorical. Unpredictable pitch behavior might have<br/>been more accurate.</p><p>I should have noted that a huge part of what I&apos;ve been trying to<br/>achieve with this it to create sampled instruments of metal and<br/>membranophone percussion which can play melodic/harmonic music. Just<br/>for example (one out of many) - when I made recordings of the frame<br/>drum &quot;one-shots&quot;, I recorded 6 strikes each, of 5 different sounds:<br/>Dum, Tak, Snap, 1/2 Finger Mute and 1/4 Finger Mute. When I look at<br/>the fundamental pitches of all these raw sounds, each and every one<br/>is at a different fundamental pitch - or had a different dominant<br/>pitch. Part of creating the final &quot;instrument&quot; multi-sample, is to<br/>tune all of these to the same or complementary pitches.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just<br/>&gt; &gt; for fun, I thought I&apos;d paste in the raw ratios from which the<br/>scale I<br/>&gt; &gt; posted was derived. You can see that there are some duplicate<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals and some that are so close to one another as to be<br/>&gt; &gt; indistinguishable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where did these come from? Were they originally separated by<br/>octaves? And what purpose<br/>&gt; do the 6-digit ratios serve?</p><p>The ratios come from converting the timbre frequencies from the FFT<br/>into cents values. Every time the results are very different. Some<br/>timbres would have octaves while others would have some interval near<br/>an octave. The 6 digit ratios are uncompromisingly showing the<br/>frequency relationships found in the timbre. Sure, you could reduce<br/>them to lower numbers, but something close, isn&apos;t what&apos;s there.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your description of the music is fascinating. I hope we get to hear<br/>it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m better than half way through with the CD - I do plan on sharing<br/>the music with friends. Probably, I&apos;ll cycle out my Tuning Punk<br/>pieces for this new crop.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The ratios aren&apos;t doing you any good as far as I can tell. You can<br/>tune a Hammond organ in<br/>&gt; 12-tET with 2-digit ratios -- I&apos;m sure these 6-digit ratios are far<br/>too accurate to allow for the natural<br/>&gt; changes in your metal drum with temperature, etc.</p><p>Yes, as above, I&apos;ve been creating multi-sampled and tuned<br/>instruments, so as to control some of the idiosyncratic behavior of<br/>these kinds of instruments, thus making them much more friendly to<br/>compose tonal music. But I will frequently combine acoustic<br/>performance, with these special sampled instruments (e.g live singing<br/>is a favorite, also every piece on the new CD has live drumming on<br/>it.).</p><p>The ratios are good in that they just show the raw translation from<br/>the fft of the timbre.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; P.S.

In this case the &quot;lowest<br/>common denominator&quot; is 60, right??</p><p>This is certainly the right tuning for<br/>the minor triad in Renaissance music, before tonality developed.<br/>However, Xavier and others have a very negative reaction to<br/>&gt; pieces of _tonal_ music in a minor key ending on a 10:12:15 triad.<br/>This is because the implied  fundamental is the submediant rather<br/>than the tonic. So a piece in A minor ending on a meantone<br/>&gt; or Just minor triad would sound sort of like it was tonicizing F,<br/>especially if the tuning was really  accurate and the chord was loud<br/>enough for combination tones to be produced. Helmholtz shared these<br/>perceptions. A 16:19:24 minor triad,<br/>though, has all combination tones supporting the sensation of the<br/>root as fundamental -- in this case, they&apos;re all overtones of A -- so<br/>it makes for a more &quot;stable&quot; tonicization of the root. So, if the<br/>final chord of a piece in minor is to be played loud, with the tonic<br/>in the bass, you&apos;ll get a much more &quot;supportive&quot; tuning from 16:19:24<br/>than from 10:12:15.<br/>&gt;<br/>Ok, I think I&apos;m getting this... but what are the &quot;fractions&quot; for<br/>16:19:24 again??

Hence one can dispense with the partials altogether, and use   sine<br/>&gt;waves. The useful chords in this music are going to be otonal ones.</p><p>approx 1 to 20</p><p>&gt;This is very different from a lot of JI music out there that uses timbres<br/>&gt;with harmonic partials, whether it&apos;s voices, strings, horns, or<br/>&gt;computer sounds. If we&apos;re talking about 5- limit JI, utonal and symmetrical<br/>&gt;chords will be about as common as otonal ones; as long as the<br/>&gt;volume isn&apos;t too loud, the consonance of these chords will depend largely on<br/>&gt;how well the harmonics of each tone line up with the harmonics<br/>&gt;of the other tones.</p><p>approx 20 to 50</p><p>&gt;Another phenomenon, the virtual pitch phenomenon, seems most important in<br/>an<br/>&gt;intermediate range of integer sizes (roughly speaking).<br/>&gt;Already in the second case above, some musicians feel that the 5-limit minor<br/>&gt;triad is better retuned as 16:19:24. This likely is due to the<br/>&gt;ear&apos;s attempt to fit all chords or subsets of chords into a single<br/>&gt;harmonic series, and the musician&apos;s desire to have the fundamental implied so<br/>&gt;strongly by the root and fifth octave-equivalent to the fundamental of the<br/>&gt;whole chord. It is this phenomemon which governs (along with<br/>&gt;the other phenomena) the intermediate-limit, otonal-leaning JI of Stamm,<br/>&gt;Gann, and Alves, for example . . .</p><p>&gt;One implication of the differing phenomena responsible for the musical<br/>&gt;usefulness of JI in these different circumstances is that a<br/>&gt;different tolerance for mistuning will apply in these situations<br/>&gt;and another implication is that there is a strong correlation between the<br/>&gt;musical media you are using and the kind of JI tuning system<br/>&gt;that is likely to be useful. If you&apos;re using loud sine waves, you&apos;re not<br/>&gt;likely to find utonal JI chords useful; while if you&apos;re using quiet<br/>&gt;bassoons, you&apos;re not likely to find chords from high up in the overtone<br/>&gt;series useful. &quot;Useful&quot; here implies more than just &quot;conducive to<br/>&gt;music&quot; -- any arbitrary tuning system could be used to good effect by a<br/>&gt;good enough composer -- in the context of this argument, by<br/>&gt;&quot;useful&quot; I really mean &quot;the music would suffer if JI were not strictly<br/>&gt;adhered to&quot;.</p><p>Paul also wrote:</p><p>&gt;Guys, the Hammond organ is, strictly speaking, a JI instrument, with all<br/>&gt;ratios containing only 2-digit integers. Yet it&apos;s designed to be a<br/>&gt;12-tET instrument -- it&apos;s within 0.7 cents of mathematically exact 12-tET.<br/>&gt;Is it JI or 12-tET? Clearly contextual considerations, not simply<br/>&gt;the size of the integers, would have to come into a useful definition of<br/>&gt;whether or   not a given piece of music is in JI.</p><p>Ah yes. Tone wheel organs. I would have said instead that, despite having<br/>all ratios containing only 2-digit integers, it is clearly a 12-tET<br/>instrument and therefore not JI. How do you feel about this one Dave<br/>Beardsley?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem likely that one could get within 0.7 cents with only 2<br/>digit integers.

Would you care to revise and/or clarify that statement?</p><p>In my experience with testing musician friends, according to both the &quot;rich&quot;<br/>and the &quot;pure&quot; listeners in the famous experiment that is brought up so<br/>often, and according to Xavier, 16:19:24 is usually preferred over 10:12:15<br/>as the &quot;correct&quot; tuning of the minor triad. A capella maestro Gerry Eskelin,<br/>you may recall, thought that 10:12:15 was the correct tuning of the minor<br/>triad, but in a blind test he preferred one very close to 16:19:24 (actually<br/>further from 10:12:15 than 16:19:24), and thought that the third of 10:12:15<br/>was &quot;uncomfortably sharp&quot;. Now it only takes a little conditioning to<br/>reverse these preferences, such as a bit of time playing Renaissance music,<br/>but the point is that 16:19:24 has a very distinct, audibly &quot;rooted&quot; quality<br/>that 10:12:15 doesn&apos;t, and the closeness of the former to 12-tET has made<br/>this quality one that most modern musicians expect to hear.</p></div><h3><a id=15770 href="#15770">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
