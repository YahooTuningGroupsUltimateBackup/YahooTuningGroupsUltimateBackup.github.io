<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>a couple of questions...</h1><h3>dante rosati &#x3C;dante@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/1999 12:59:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi yall-</p><p>I subscribed about a week ago and have been enjoying the microtonal<br/>repartee!...</p><p>I am currently a non microtonal guitarist, but while I was getting my<br/>degree at Juilliard I also studied electronic music with Hubert Howe and we<br/>mostly used Csound. I did some pieces based on Phi, prime numbers and the<br/>other usual suspects. It was fascinating, but ultimately I became somewhat<br/>dissatisfied with the sounds I was getting and have since mostly stuck with<br/>the old wooden box with six strings. I find the electric guitar a wonderful<br/>electronic instrument with an incredibly rich palate of sounds available<br/>and I find it more satisfing to manipulate a guitar with my fingers rather<br/>then type lots of code and wait a couple of hours to generate the piece.<br/>Back then Csound on a Next was hot shit, but now I run Csound on my dinky<br/>quadra 630 and it works great. For awhile last year I was getting lists of<br/>the sun&apos;s spherical harmonic frequencies off the internet and making sounds<br/>with them. Its fun, but I always end up with my box and six strings...</p><p>. Oh yes, while I was at Juilliard we did a production of Partch&apos;s&quot;<br/>Revelation in the Courthouse park&quot;, directed by Danlee Mitchell. I was<br/>lucky to get to play &quot;Guitar I&quot; in the production (we did two<br/>performances). It was alot of fun to play Partch&apos;s original guitar.<br/>Although I glanced at his book then (this was in &apos;90), I was not able to<br/>penetrate his whole thesis. Right now I have been studing his book closley<br/>and find it a remarkable mix of brilliance and crankism.  I find his notion<br/>that what the ear responds to is ratios (as some kind of abstraction)<br/>rather than to the overtone series per se interesting but dubious. If it<br/>were not for overtones, there would be no beating phenomena that make a<br/>justly tuned interval just in the first place.</p><p> I don&apos;t see 4/3 as an abstract utonal generation or some kind of &quot;three<br/>limit&quot; interval, but rather as the interval between the third and fourth<br/>partial. Alternately it can be thought of as dividing a string in 3 and<br/>then making another string 4 of those lengths. Or, it is 3/4 of a string in<br/>relation to the whole string. To my mind these are more concrete ways of<br/>deriving ratios. Perhaps I dont understand yet what Partch was getting at.<br/>(I have a small piece up as part of my guitar page on harmonics and string<br/>divisions, but its badly in need of revision<br/><a href="http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/division.html">http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/division.html</a>)</p><p>Anyway, since woodworking is not my thing, I do not ever expect to be able<br/>to refret a guitar. What I was wondering was does anybody know if someone<br/>is currently making a guitar with interchangable fretboards? I see a real<br/>nice one in Scheider&apos;s book &quot;The Contemporary guitar&quot; (1985), that he says<br/>is made by Tom Stone of Intonation Systems in Iowa. A search on the net<br/>turns up nothing, so I dont know if anything like this is being made by<br/>anyone. The series of fretboards is just what I would drool over - various<br/>just, harmonic, historical and cultural intonations. Anybody who can help<br/>me out here, I would appreciate it greatly.</p><p>For something completely different - have people looked at what intervals<br/>birds sing in? or humpback whales? I think it would be very interesting!</p><p>regards,</p><p>dante</p></div>
