You can see clearly from<br/>the lattice that there is no *simpler* ratio smaller than<br/>2 cents; the skhisma  [ = 3^8 * 5^1 ]  is the smallest.</p><p>If you were to continue the lattice beyond my boundaries, with<br/>the numbers in both the numerators and denominators becoming<br/>progressively larger the farther you go from the central 1/1,<br/>you would eventually find smaller intervals (i.e., &apos;smaller than<br/>2 cents&apos;).</p><p>Concerning your second question,</p><p>&gt; doesn&apos;t there have to be one [a simpler ratio?],<br/>&gt; since there&apos;s never a &quot;best&quot; rational approximation to an<br/>&gt; irrational number (there&apos;s always a better one)?</p><p>It&apos;s not clear to me what you meant by &apos;one&apos;, because</p><p>1) it seems to refer to &apos;a simpler ratio&apos;, which<br/>2) doesn&apos;t make sense in the light of your next comment.</p><p>A better rational approximation will always be the result of<br/>using larger numbers in the comparison.  The &apos;largeness&apos;<br/>can be the result of either higher prime-factors or higher<br/>exponents, or both.  In this particular case, we&apos;re expressly<br/>limiting our prime-factors to the 5-limit, so the more accurate<br/>rational approximation will always be the result of higher<br/>exponents.</p><p>My last comment is that I don&apos;t see what an &apos;irrational&apos; number<br/>has to do with anything.  The skhisma, when it refers specifically<br/>to 32805/32768   [ = 3^8 * 5^1 ]  as it generally does, is<br/>a precisely determined *rational* interval designating the<br/>difference between the JI &apos;major 3rd&apos; [ 5/4 = ~386 cents ]<br/>and the Pythagorean &apos;diminished 4th&apos; [ 8192/6561 = 2^12 * 3^-8<br/>= ~384 cents ].  The &apos;2 cents&apos; is merely the *approximate*<br/>cent-value of the 32805/32768 skhisma, which can be expressed<br/>more accurately as ~1.9537208 cents.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
