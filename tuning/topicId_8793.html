The issue whether and when these instruments may have been used<br/>in the performance of vocal music remains an often controversial one,<br/>although it is an easier matter to note, for example, the diverse<br/>repertory of keyboard, lute, and instrumental ensemble music in the<br/>16th century.</p><p>While some of what follows is general background, I have included some<br/>material on intonational issues which I hope may prove of special<br/>interest here. For example, Mark Lindley&apos;s suggestion that the<br/>modified Pythagorean keyboard tunings in vogue during the early 15th<br/>century may have influenced the vocal music of the young Dufay and his<br/>peers is certainly an engaging one.</p><p>In considering the possible role of keyboard instruments in medieval<br/>and Renaissance music it is easy to rebut obvious misunderstandings,<br/>and much harder to assess actual practice. Thus it is now well<br/>understood that when the composer Leonin, who flourished around the<br/>third quarter of the 12th century, is referred to as _organista<br/>optima_, this means &quot;the best composer of organum&quot; rather than &quot;the<br/>best organist.&quot; Whether Notre Dame used an organ for its liturgical<br/>music before the first recorded evidence of this practice in the<br/>earlier 14th century, and if so how, remains a moot question.</p><p>I have divided the following discussion into three parts. The first<br/>part deals with medieval polyphony to 1300, where the presence of<br/>organs is documented but their use in polyphonic music uncertain, apart<br/>from a late 13th-century poem informing us that the portative organ<br/>can be used to play a melodic line in a motet.</p><p>The second part considers the late Gothic era of 1300-1450. During the<br/>first portion of this era, idiomatic keyboard music emerges and the<br/>12-note (&quot;7+5&quot;) keyboard becomes standard, with the organ and the<br/>&quot;chekker&quot; (likely a clavichord) the probable instruments for this<br/>music. During the latter portion, the harpischord also becomes part of<br/>the scene, and modified Pythagorean tunings interact with stylistic<br/>trends in vocal as well as instrumental music leading to meantone<br/>temperament and the ideal of 5-limit just intonation (JI) for voices.</p><p>The third part addresses the Renaissance and Manneristic Eras of<br/>roughly 1450-1640, a period when meantone is the general tuning of<br/>choice for keyboards, and when the advent and growth of the music<br/>printing business lends a technological impetus to the popularization<br/>of instrumental as well as vocal music. Here it may be significant<br/>that Pietro Aaron&apos;s _Toscanello in Musica_ (1523), written as an<br/>introduction to music and its composition in the vernacular, includes<br/>a chapter for beginners on how to tune a keyboard, known as the<br/>earliest description of 1/4-comma meantone with a pure major third<br/>divided into four equally narrowed fifths. Both keyboards and lute<br/>have rich and diverse repertories in the 16th century, and the<br/>practiced of accompanied solo singing (especially to the lute or<br/>allied instruments) in this era may place the continuo and related<br/>developments of around 1600 in perspective.</p><p>-----------------------------<br/>1. Medieval polyphony to 1300<br/>-----------------------------</p><p>The recorded practice of polyphony in Western Europe goes back to the<br/>epoch of around 850-900, the usual dating proposed from the _Musica<br/>enchiriadis_ and companion treatises. Such treatises present two<br/>methods of improvised polyphony, including some examples with exact<br/>pitch notation. The first technique of _organum_, maybe best<br/>translated as &quot;organized music,&quot; involves two, three, or four voices<br/>singing in consistent parallels using the _symphoniae_ or concords:<br/>the fifth (3:2) and fourth (4:3), which might have their voices<br/>doubled at the octave. The second technique, shown for two voices, has<br/>these voices typically beginning on a unison, expanding to a fourth,<br/>moving mostly in a series of parallel fourths, and then converging<br/>again on a unison. While the first technique can be heard as a<br/>magnificent vertical amplification of a basic melody, the second<br/>technique invites independent development of the added voice.</p><p>Both techniques have analogues in various musical traditions where<br/>fifths and fourths are especially favored as concords. By the<br/>millennium of 1000, it would seem that this interest in improvised<br/>polyphony had led to a practice of composition, as reflected by the<br/>polyphonic repertories of Winchester and the earliest pieces of<br/>Chartres. Around 1030, Guido d&apos;Arezzo in his _Micrologus_ describes<br/>his own favored technique of organum for two voices, in which he<br/>regularly accepts and recognizes not only the stable unison and<br/>fourth, but unstable major seconds and major and minor thirds, and<br/>describes some of his favorite techniques for the _occursus_ (&quot;coming<br/>together&quot;) or cadencing of the voices at the unison.</p><p>What role, if any, the early organ may have played in these<br/>developments is an open question. For an adventurous discussion of<br/>these issues, see Peter F. Williams, _The Organ in Western Culture,<br/>750-1250_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993).</p><p>During the later 11th and early 12th centuries, styles developed in<br/>which _all_ the vertical intervals from unison to octave and sometimes<br/>beyond were used, with a general preference for contrary motion,<br/>although parallel fifths or fourths remained common as a textural<br/>resource. By the middle of the century, two distinct styles may be<br/>seen in such repertories as St. Martial or Limoges in France and<br/>Santiago de Compostella in Spain (the latter repertory now viewed as<br/>likely having been composed in northern France). In what might be<br/>called _sustained note_ or _organum_ style, the original chant melody<br/>is stretched out into prolonged notes, above which (mostly, since the<br/>voices sometimes cross) the added voice sings elaborate melismas. In<br/>_discant_ style, the two voices move in more or less note-againt-note<br/>rhythm.</p><p>The sustained notes in the tenor part of this music -- the part which<br/>&quot;holds&quot; the Gregorian chant melody on which the new voice is composed<br/>-- have often been described as &quot;pedal points&quot; or &quot;organ points&quot; by<br/>modern writers, and the use of an organ to play these notes is common<br/>in modern performances. Whether and how often the organ might have<br/>been used in the 12th century remains a question open to much guessing<br/>and inference.</p><p>The same statement might apply to the Notre Dame School with its famed<br/>composers Leonin (fl. c. 1150-1175?) and Perotin (fl. c. 1180-1205?).<br/>While Leonin&apos;s music uses the traditional two-voice texture, Perotin<br/>also composes for three and four voices. His music and that of his<br/>colleagues establishes the complete trine (e.g. D3-A3-D4, outer<br/>octave, lower fifth, upper fourth) as the unit of full sonority,<br/>marking the advent of the trinic era (c. 1200-1450). Perotin&apos;s<br/>grand style might also be said to mark the advent of _combinative_<br/>harmony in which elementary intervals are combined into a variety of<br/>multi-voice sonorities (stable and unstable) and cadences.</p><p>A bit more than 30 years ago, a university music professor I met<br/>declared, &quot;We know that Perotin used an organ.&quot; However, more recent<br/>researches have shown no mention in Notre Dame&apos;s performance rubrics<br/>of an organ until around 1330. Williams, in his book on the organ,<br/>concludes that the use of this instrument in the time of Leonin or<br/>Perotin appears plausible, but not proven.</p><p>While some modern performances use an organ for the sustained notes in<br/>the tenors of Perotin&apos;s organa for three and four voices -- which can<br/>last for 30 or more measures of a piece in modern transcription --<br/>other groups have used singers alone with staggered breathing among<br/>those singing the tenor. In the _clausula_ portions of these organa,<br/>where the lower voice moves in a regular rhythm, the organ could have<br/>given the tenor or &quot;foundation&quot; part a distinct timbre -- as would<br/>also be true in polyphonic _conducti_ for two, three, or four voices,<br/>where the tenor is usually newly composed as well as the upper lines,<br/>and all voices tend to move more or less note-against-note.</p><p>Interestingly, the era around 1200 is often taken to be the time when<br/>the flexible modern keyboard with its agile fingering was introduced<br/>for the organ, replacing much slower slider mechanisms and the like.<br/>Also, the portative organ provided a versatile, mostly melodic<br/>instrument -- the player working the keyboard with one hand and the<br/>bellows with the other.</p><p>By around the late 13th century, in the _Roman de la Rose_, we find a<br/>mention of the portative organ as an instrument used in polyphonic<br/>music: it could be used to play either the tenor or the _treble_ of a<br/>motet, then the favorite form of part music.</p><p>Around this same time, we find in sources such as the Montpellier and<br/>Bamberg manuscripts certain &quot;untexted motets,&quot; as they might best be<br/>called, pieces where the absence of words in all parts suggests,<br/>although it does not require, instrumental ensemble performances. The<br/>title of one of these pieces, _In seculum viellatoris_ or &quot;The _In<br/>seculum_ of the vielle (fiddle) player,&quot; might be taken as one of the<br/>earliest references to a specific instrument for polyphonic music.</p><p>How important might the organ have been in all of these developments?<br/>While Williams argues that this keyboard instrument may have played a<br/>significant role in shaping Western European tastes, for example<br/>encouraging an emphasis on &quot;standardized&quot; diatonic intonation rather<br/>than microtonal flourishes of the voice, others might argue that the<br/>evolution of polyphony follows its own musical logic and stylistic<br/>taste with or without the presence of keyboard or other instruments.</p><p>------------------------------<br/>2. The late Gothic (1300-1450)<br/>------------------------------</p><p>The epoch of around 1325-1335 may herald two landmarks in the<br/>development of the organ: the first known collection of idiomatic<br/>keyboard music, the Robertsbridge Codex, and the advent of the &quot;7+5&quot;<br/>keyboard, all 12 notes of this keyboard being called for by the music<br/>of this collection. As Mark Lindley suggests, a 12-note Pythagorean<br/>tuning of Eb-G# would nicely fit this music. In any case, writing<br/>around 1325, Jacobus of Liege tells us that keyboards now have the<br/>whole-tones &quot;almost everywhere&quot; divided into semitones.</p><p>The Robertsbridge Codex, with proposed dates ranging from 1325 to<br/>1365, includes both dance music and ornamented versions of vocal<br/>motets; both types of compositions will remain common in later<br/>keyboard sources.</p><p>One of the greatest composers of the century, Francesco Landini<br/>(1325-1397), was famed also as a player of the portative organ, and it<br/>was said that his music attracted the birds by its beauty. It is easy<br/>to imagine such an instrument enriching the texture of various kinds<br/>of polyphonic music.</p><p>In addition to the various forms of organ, 14th-century sources<br/>mention a stringed keyboard referred to as the _chekker_, likely a<br/>kind of clavichord which would be used as a less expensive substitute<br/>for the organ. It appears that the plucked harpischord may have<br/>appeared on the scene shortly before 1400, with the first detailed<br/>descriptions dating around 1440.</p><p>The era around 1380-1450 may have a special significance from the<br/>viewpoint of intonation, as Mark Lindley has suggested. This era<br/>offers various keyboard repertories including the Faenza Codex and the<br/>earlier compositions in the Buxheimer Organ Book, as well as some<br/>other German tablatures. In the earlier part of this era, pieces<br/>included ornamented versions of songs by Guillaume de Machaut<br/>(c. 1300-1377) and Landini, for example, as well as liturgical<br/>settings. The latter part of the era (c. 1420-1450) coincides with the<br/>epoch of the young Dufay, often viewed as marking the transition from<br/>Gothic to Renaissance.</p><p>Lindley proposes that the keyboard practice of tuning sharps as<br/>Pythagorean flats (G# as Ab; C# as Db; F# as Gb) -- starting maybe<br/>around 1370 or 1380 in Florence, and common by the first decades of<br/>the 15th century -- may have had an influence not only on keyboard<br/>music, but on the vocal music of composers such as Ciconia and the<br/>young Dufay.  In this tuning, thirds involving written sharps would be<br/>realized as Pythagorean diminished fourths, known by modern theorists<br/>as &quot;schisma thirds&quot; only a schisma (32805:32768) or ~1.95 cents from<br/>pure 5-based ratios.</p><p>Lindley shows how, in collections such as the Buxheimer Organ Book,<br/>prolonged noncadential sonorities with these almost-pure thirds, are<br/>used as a &quot;stock-in-trade.&quot; He suggests that the music of composers<br/>such as the early Dufay would also fit a kind of vocal intonation<br/>influenced by this kind of keyboard tuning.</p><p>I find Lindley&apos;s hypothesis appealing and beguiling. In a 12-note<br/>keyboard tuning (Gb-B) of the kind described by various 15th-century<br/>theorists as well as Lindley, thirds and sixths involving sharps will<br/>be virtually pure schisma intervals, with other thirds and sixths<br/>having their usual active Pythagorean portions. One variation for<br/>keyboards with more than 12 notes per octave, or for freely tuned<br/>voices, would be to use the near-pure schisma thirds for prolonged<br/>noncadential sonorities, and wide Pythagorean major thirds and sixths<br/>in cadential progressions to fifths and octaves (M3-5, M6-8).</p><p>Around 1450, Mark Lindley infers a shift to meantone temperament in<br/>part from the style of compositions by Conrad von Paumann with<br/>successions of tertian sonorities which Lindley concludes are meant to<br/>be &quot;firmer&quot; than they would in a Pythagorean tuning. Around this same<br/>time, the vocal music of the later Dufay and Ockeghem similarly<br/>features such textures, suggesting a trend toward a 5-limit ideal.<br/>Here it might be best to say that the worlds of vocal and keyboard<br/>music -- and their intonational ideals -- are not unrelated, and may<br/>interact in various ways.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>3. Renaissance and Manneristic Eras (1450-1640)<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>The famous treatise on practical music by Bartoleme Ramos (1482)<br/>includes both the first known division of the monochord in 5-limit JI<br/>(with 5:4 and 6:5 thirds, etc.), and a discussion of keyboard tunings<br/>in which Ramos recommends what Mark Lindley persuasively interprets as<br/>a meantone tuning of Ab-C#. In 1496, around the time that composers<br/>such as Josquin and Isaac are introducing the practice of sometimes<br/>concluding pieces with sonorities including a third, Gaffurius tells<br/>us that organs are tuned with the fifths narrowed by a &quot;small and<br/>hidden&quot; quantity. In theory as well as practice, tertian verticality<br/>has clearly arrived.</p><p>Aaron&apos;s _Toscanello_ of 1523, as a conclusion to its introduction in<br/>the vernacular for the budding composer, offers a beginner&apos;s guide to<br/>tuning a keyboard instrument in meantone -- inviting us to guess that<br/>members of Aaron&apos;s popular audience might have had access to such<br/>instruments. The published collections of music for the keyboard by<br/>printers such as Marcantonio of Bologna in this same year, and<br/>Attaingnant (e.g. 1530), might suggest a similar conclusion.</p><p>In the _Courtier_ of Castiglione, published in 1528 but likely written<br/>by 1516, one speaker in the dialogue on music expresses a preference<br/>for the art of singing to the _viola_ -- that is, the plucked _viola a<br/>mano_, an instrument akin to the Spanish vihuela or the lute. Such an<br/>instrument in this epoch may have been tempered in some form of<br/>meantone, although by around 1545, a 12-note octave with equal<br/>semitones (12-tone equal temperament or 12-tet) seems to have become<br/>standard.</p><p>It would be beyond the scope of this article to survey the richness of<br/>16th-century lute and keyboard repertories, but the musical wealth of<br/>these repertories and their offering both of derivative works from<br/>vocal models and of distinctive instrumental forms is well worth<br/>noting.</p><p>While the abundance in the 16th century both of vocal music (still the<br/>especially valued norm) and of instrumental music is clear, the<br/>meeting ground between voices and instruments is only partially<br/>suggested, for example, by documented instrumentation practices for<br/>the Medici _intermedii_ or musical presentations on festive or<br/>ceremonial occasions. We know that madrigals and similar forms of<br/>vocal music could be performed with various combinations of voices and<br/>instruments, as well as with voices alone.</p><p>In his dialogue of 1581 on ancient and modern music, Vincenzo Galilei<br/>proposes that voices tend to follow the intonation of either the lute<br/>(12-tet) or of keyboards (meantone, ideally for Galilei 2/7-comma)<br/>when they sing with these instruments. Unaccompanied voices, in his<br/>view, lean toward a tuning somewhere between lutes and keyboards on<br/>what we might call the meantone continuum, but closer to keyboards.<br/>The more orthodox view of Zarlino, for example, holds that voices tend<br/>to JI, although a system of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; after Vicentino and Erlich<br/>might partially reconcile these models.</p><p>In countries such as Italy and Spain, the lute song represents a genre<br/>for solo voice with an accompanying instrument. It has been suggested<br/>that some women composers in Italy during this era may have begun<br/>their initiation in counterpoint through their skills as accomplished<br/>lutenists and singers. The madrigals of Maddalena Casulana (c. 1540-?)<br/>indeed show a feeling for note-against-note declamatory textures as<br/>well as a mastery of more complex polyphony, and a lute song from a<br/>manuscript of Isabelle de&apos; Medici nicely illustrates this kind of<br/>declamatory style.</p><p>More generally, such note-against-note styles can be found in the<br/>Italian frottola and Spanish villancico of around 1500, and play an<br/>important role along with more elaborate contrapuntal techniques in<br/>forms such as the 16th-century madrigal. In the realm of specifically<br/>instrumental music, also, an author such Tomas de Santa Maria (1565)<br/>describes how to compose or improvise four-voice textures in mostly<br/>note-against-note motion where the intervals between the outer voices<br/>are primary, the inner voices serving to &quot;fill in the space&quot; and add<br/>accompanying consonances.</p><p>Thus while the advent of continuo and the new solo song around 1600,<br/>together with the opera and oratorio, is indeed an important landmark,<br/>it draws on various 16th-century techniques and performance<br/>practices.[1]</p><p>Interestingly, Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643) and his brother Giulio<br/>Cesare Monteverdi themselves view the newer style or _Seconda<br/>Prattica_ (&quot;Second Practice&quot;) as including many composers of the<br/>middle and late 16th century beginning with Cipriano de Rore; among<br/>its exemplars they list madrigalists such as Giaches de Wert as well<br/>as exponents of the new solo song such as Caccini. Here we might also<br/>include Vicentino, who in his treatise of 1555 not only champions the<br/>chromatic and enharmonic genera but urges that any dissonance or<br/>unusual melodic leap may be justified if it aptly expresses the words.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s aesthetic ideal of expressive text setting, and practices<br/>such as the striking melodic leaps in Wert&apos;s madrigals or the bold<br/>dissonances of Monteverdi and Gesualdo, may be seen as aspects of a<br/>&quot;Manneristic Era&quot; in music of the kind proposed by scholars such as<br/>Maria Rika Maniates. This era, running roughly from Rore to<br/>Monteverdi, say 1540-1640, includes developments of the middle and<br/>late 16th century as well as the early 17th century.</p><p>In a forum devoted to alternative tunings, it might be well to quote<br/>the words of Nicola Vicentino in a kind of advertisement for his<br/>_arciorgano_ dated 1561[1]:</p><p>          &quot;Furthermore, among the other modes of composing and<br/>           of playing, there is one of composing [a type] of<br/>           music that involves recitation by a solo singer with<br/>           the instrument, and it will be such music that in it<br/>           one will hear recited every sort of word or rather<br/>           lofty speech, accompanied by harmony.&quot;</p><p>Various kinds of 16th-century music, including the lute song as well<br/>as the improvised singing of sonnets and the like to a simple<br/>accompaniment, might have inspired Vicentino&apos;s statement; his words,<br/>suggesting also the desire of composers around 1600 &quot;to speak in<br/>harmony,&quot; offer a connection with the declamatory art of Monteverdi,<br/>or of Giulio or Francesca Caccini.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.
