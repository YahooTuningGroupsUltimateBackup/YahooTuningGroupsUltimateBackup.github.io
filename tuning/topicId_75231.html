Professor Kalahne should have given the reference<br/>to two papers in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1885,<br/>in which Hipkins, who was Broadwood&apos;s expert, showed that<br/>the observations of Helmholtz on this point were erroneous<br/>in every respect. About twenty years ago I used to listen to<br/>a bass string in every good piano I could come across. The<br/>7th harmonic is one of the most prominent. It can invariably<br/>be detected by the beats which it makes with the minor<br/>seventh three octaves above.</p><p>&quot;Pole&apos;s table<br/>on p. 222 showing the same degree of roughness for 5 : 6,<br/>5 : 9, and the tritone, the diabolic interval, 32: 45, proves<br/>that he too did not know what he was talking about. Pole<br/>can never have had an opportunity to submit this estimate<br/>to the test of exact experiment. If there is not too much<br/>noise, it is possible to attempt an analysis of the repulsive<br/>combination Mi contra Fa, best taken for the purpose in the<br/>twice-accented octave. The reeds f, b&quot; sounding together<br/>produce two Tartini tones, making an interval somewhere<br/>between the fourth and the fifth. The ear is not able to<br/>define them much more closely than that. They are irrational.<br/>But a simple calculation shows that the full discord is as<br/>13 : 19: 32 : 45, and a reference to Ellis&apos;s Table and a little<br/>patience give 657c. as the equivalent of 13 : 19. So now we<br/>know that F sustained or remembered against B produces<br/>two more notes, heard or under-heard, which together make<br/>an impossible Fifth, 45c. or a quarter of a minor tone flat.</p><p>&quot;... to some<br/>persons two sustained notes may mean either three notes or<br/>four notes. Tartini was one of these, Joachim was another,<br/>the late Sir Thomas Wrightson was another. It is on record<br/>that all three employed septimal intervals in their doublestopping.</p><p>&quot;I never realised how few persons are able to<br/>detect these undertones (Tartini tones) until I tried to<br/>demonstrate the enharmonic system of Olympos before the<br/>Philological Society in 1928 by means of an octave of twenty<br/>tuning-forks, when I found to my dismay that in most cases<br/>the demonstration was a complete failure. Hence the<br/>necessity for the present instrument, to bring out the latent<br/>harmony.</p><p>&quot;For example, these two tuning-forks give Tartini&apos;s<br/>substitute for the tritone 32 : 45 in the ascending scale from<br/>C. Their ratio is 5: 7, which is the inversion of 10:7,<br/>found, as I infer, by Olympos as a substitute for the tritone<br/>down from B to F (45 : 32) in the Greek descending scale<br/>from E.</p><p>&quot;On the harmonium the<br/>accord 2 : 3 : 5 : 7 with middle C as 5 should be heard as a<br/>perfectly smooth concord. This is the true form of the<br/>accord known as the German Sixth. According to Helmholtz<br/>(p. 228) &grave;the scales of modern music cannot possibly accept<br/>tones determined by the number 7,&apos; a truly colossal blunder.</p><p>&quot;With each substantive key-note we must<br/>have the 17th harmonic found by Ellis to give the true form<br/>of the accords of the minor seventh and ninth, (8): 10: 12:<br/>14: 17.</p><p>&quot;If it is true that &apos;we have<br/>no experience of septimal harmony,&apos; that is not the fault of<br/>A. J. Ellis, but the confession implies that we cannot appreciate<br/>fine chamber-music when we hear it.</p><p>&quot;This interval of approximately 7c, making all the difference<br/>between happiness and misery, recurs so frequently that I<br/>decided to see what would happen, on paper, if the octave<br/>were divided into 171 equal parts. I have worked it out, and<br/>find that this new cycle contains all the intervals of quintal,<br/>tertian, septimal, and septendecimal harmony to within lc.<br/>The claim may therefore be made that the cycle of 171<br/>represents the perfect musical scale.&quot;</p><p>&quot;... when two notes are sounded together,<br/>as Lord Rayleigh shows, there is no limit to the fineness of<br/>discrimination by the method of beats. I believe that is the<br/>only instance in which any human sense is capable of an<br/>unlimited fineness of discrimination; but it does not mean<br/>that you must have a very keen musical ear in order to do<br/>it.
