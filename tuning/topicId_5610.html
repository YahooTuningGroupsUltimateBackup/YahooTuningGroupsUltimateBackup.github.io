Oct. 22 at 8 pm at the<br/>Nobles Building on the campus of Metro State University, St. Paul,<br/>Minnesota, USA. It is the first act of the Strange Attractors III<br/>Festival of Experimental Internedia Art, which features local, national,<br/>and international artists working with multimedia, intermedia, and<br/>recent technologies.</p><p>To get there, take I-94 East, past the downtown St. Paul exits, until<br/>Mounds Blvd., which is a LEFT exit. Take a left at the end of this exit,<br/>and then a right (on to E. 7th), and Nobles is the big flat building on<br/>the north side of the road.</p><p>Admission is $6 standard and $4 for students and seniors.</p><p>The concert features music in a surprising variety of styles, tuning<br/>systems, and rhythmic structures, including work by Harold Fortuin, Kris<br/>Peck, Ivor Darreg, and 16th century Italian composer Nicola Vicentino.<br/>Live video projection will accompany the live music, and studio pieces<br/>will be projected and mixed live through a quadrophonic system. Poems by<br/>Lhadro Niutroff will be performed between musical pieces.</p><p>For more info, phone 651-793-3967, or visit<br/><a href="http://www.visi.com/~hfortuin">http://www.visi.com/~hfortuin</a></p><p>Hope to see you there!</p><p>(If you&apos;re obviously not near enough to St. Paul to come, understand<br/>this announcement as the answer to<br/>&quot;What&apos;s Harold been up to lately?&quot;)</p></div>
