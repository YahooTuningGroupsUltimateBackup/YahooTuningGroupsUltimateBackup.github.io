Then he<br/>posits the existence of different pitch detection mechanisms for pure<br/>tones and complex tones and claims that because of this there are two<br/>kinds of pitch, spectral and virtual.</p><p>I don&apos;t think this makes sense. Even if there were different<br/>mechanisms for pure and complex tones, that doesn&apos;t imply that there<br/>are two psychological attributes. The phenomenal character (i.e. what<br/>the experience is like) of pure tone pitch and complex tone pitch is<br/>the same. The pitch of a frequency modulated tone where the<br/>modulation index increases starting from zero (at zero the tone is<br/>pure) doesn&apos;t suddenly change its&apos; pitch quality when the sidebands<br/>appear.</p><p>I also don&apos;t like the term &quot;virtual pitch&quot; as it implies that there<br/>is something illusory about it. It seems to me that this is a relic<br/>of the notion that we hear the fundamental, that is the frequency<br/>component at the fundamental frequency, when we hear the pitch of a<br/>complex tone even when the fundamental is missing. Yes, surely pitch<br/>is correlated with the fundamental frequency of a complex tone but<br/>that is not the same thing as the fundamental. The former is a<br/>property of the sound wave while the latter is a particular component<br/>of that sound wave. Confusing the two would be a category mistake.<br/>Pitch is simply the psychological attribute that correlates with<br/>periodicity.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=85937 href="#85937">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2010 9:17:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would disagree. Whether a sound has some sort of &quot;spectral pitch&quot;, as he puts it (giving fricative phonemes as a possible example), or whether it&apos;s a complex tone with a possible missing fundamental, both sounds exploit some weaker or stronger degree of periodicity, which can be found even in the &quot;shapes&quot; of the sounds themselves, not only just in the way we hear them.
