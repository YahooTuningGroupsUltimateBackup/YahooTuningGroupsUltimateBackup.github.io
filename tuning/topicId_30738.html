I came across your post on the 31-tone piano<br/>recently and was very interested, because I think the fact that<br/>it&apos;s been sitting there in Vienna may relate to some of the topics<br/>I covered in my talk at April&apos;s Microfest (&quot;Microtonality in<br/>Berlin and Vienna in the early 1900s&quot;).  I&apos;ve found that Josef<br/>Petzval was lecturing on and demonstrating 31-EDO at the<br/>University of Vienna in the late 1800s.  So apparently there<br/>was some interest in 31-EDO in Vienna during the 19th Century.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
