In addition to<br/>tabulating all the ET&apos;s with 5 to 120 tones, we also analysed all the<br/>tunings up to 1200 tones in terms of how well they expressed the<br/>harmonic series intervals up too, IIRC, 41/32. We also looked a few<br/>divisions of the 3/1 and compiled large tables of just intervals.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure of the exact year the Erv decided that 270 and 612 were<br/>exceptional temperaments, but I would guess about 1966. He would know.<br/>The 612-edo was known much earlier, of course.</p><p>I was interested in Gene Ward Smith&apos;s statement that his brother<br/>computed tuning tables at UC, Berkeley in 1968. I moved to the<br/>Department of Genetics at Berkeley in early 1971 to study mitochondrial<br/>genetics. I also wanted to continue my tuning studies and went to the<br/>music department to try to convince them to get me some time on the<br/>mainframe. They turned me down, saying that such studies had already<br/>been done; I presume it was by Gene&apos;s brother.</p><p>William Stoney at Duke and North Carolina universities studied all the<br/>EDO&apos;s up to 144 tones and reported this in a book &quot;The Computer and<br/>Music,&quot; edited by Harry B. Lincoln in 1970 and published by Cornell<br/>University Press.</p><p>Erv and I presented some of our results in a paper at the ICMC in<br/>Denton, TX in 1981.</p><p>Donald Hall at Sacramento State University (?) published some papers in<br/>the 70&apos;, IIRC, which discussed EDO&apos;s like 494, etc. I think he published<br/>these in JASA, but I don&apos;t remember this AM.</p><p>--john</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 2:37:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was interested in Gene Ward Smith&apos;s statement that his brother<br/>&gt; computed tuning tables at UC, Berkeley in 1968.

My brother was one of the first CS majors at Berkekey, and simply submitted a deck of cards for the CDC to run an extremely simple program with a comp time less than a second. I then spent a long time in careful study of the output. By the way, did you two notice 311? I would think it would have jumped out at you; it did with me and I only went up to 31.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 2:41:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure of the exact year the Erv decided that 270 and 612 were<br/>&gt; exceptional temperaments, but I would guess about 1966.</p><p>Ennealimmal rules!
