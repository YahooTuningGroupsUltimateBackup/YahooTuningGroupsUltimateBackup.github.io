Here, we<br/>find mention, in Tamil literature, of raga-s to be sung during the<br/>day, at night, and at any time.  In Karnatic music, there are some<br/>raga-s like malahari (morning), and Shri (midday) which follow time<br/>theory, but they are also performed at other times of the day; this<br/>makes for a very flexible time theory.</p><p>Time theory in Hindustani (North Indian) music has two aspects: the<br/>seasons, and the times of the day (/night).</p><p>The Seasons<br/>-----------<br/>Bharat Muni of Natyashastra does not mention about the time theory.<br/>Probably, the first ever mention occurs in sangita-makaranda of<br/>Narada III (probable date 7th-11th century AD). The proper<br/>classification came from Someshwara (12th century AD).  According to<br/>Narada, quoted in sangita-darpanam by Damodara Pandit, the raga-s and<br/>the related seasons are:</p><p>Shri raga, shishira (winter); vasanta, spring; Bhairava, (greeshma)<br/>summer;  Panchama, (sharad) autumn; Megha, rainy season; nata-<br/>narayana, hemanta (early winter).  He then adds that &quot;singers can<br/>sing any of these at any time, at their pleasure.&quot;  Drawing from<br/>other sources, the list, reads like:  Hindola, spring; Deepaka,<br/>summer; Megha, rainy season; Bhairava, winter; Shri raga, hemanta;<br/>Malkaus, shishira.  Apart from the classification of raga-s based on<br/>the seasons, depending upon the author and principle applied, we have<br/>more than 35 classifications of raga-s.</p><p>The Times of the/night<br/>----------------------</p><p>Time theory uses the unit of prahara.  This Sanskrit word is<br/>translated as &quot;watch&quot; and there are eight watches (prahara-s) per 24-<br/>hour cycle, each of three hours. The first prahara (watch) of the day<br/>starts at 6 am, the second at 9am, the third at 12 noon, and the<br/>fourth, at 3 pm.  The first prahara (watch) of night starts at 6 pm,<br/>the fourth at 3 am, till 6 am.</p><p>A raga has its own rasa.  The word rasa has been variously translated<br/>as mood, sentiment, spirit, atmosphere, feeling, emotion, expression,<br/>individuality, etc.  Now, according to the time theory, there is a<br/>natural association between the mood and the time of the day (or, the<br/>season, as discussed above).  The origin of this concept may lie in<br/>the mood swings during various festive celebrations associated with<br/>seasons, solstices, equinoxes, and the times of the day.  So, a raga,<br/>most aptly and suitably, can be sung only during a particular prahara<br/>(watch). Historically, this &quot;can be sung&quot; became &quot;shall be sung&quot;; and<br/>the time convention is staunchly observed even today.  At one stage,<br/>prohibition, immutability, offense, and penalty came to be associated<br/>with performing a raga at any non-stipulated time.</p><p>The Classification<br/>------------------</p><p>The raga-s came first, the current time theory came much later.<br/>While much consistency has been observed in the study of the time<br/>theory of raga, we have yet to firmly establish its principles and<br/>theoretical basis.  So, while it has come to be known as a theory, it<br/>is a hypothesis, at this stage.  It appears to be multi-faceted,<br/>having its roots probably as much in physics, as in metaphysics and<br/>aesthetics.  However, let it not be undermined: it deserves much<br/>deeper study than it has been meted out. A deeper study of this<br/>theory promises to bring out significant aesthetic principles which<br/>may have universal applications in the field of music.</p><p>The following generalisations have been observed: [In each, there<br/>will be exceptions, to prove the rule]</p><p>(1)  The location of vadi.</p><p> The uttara raga-s, the raga-s with their stipulated performance time<br/>lying between midnight-midday, have their vadi (consonant) in<br/>uttaranga (upper tetrachord).  Thus, for example, the vadi of a<br/>morning raga will be one of the the Pa (G), Dha komala (A flat), Dha<br/>shuddha (A), Ni komala (B flat), Ni shuddha (B), SA (C).  Ma shuddha<br/>(F) is also included here.</p><p>The poorva raga-s, the raga-s with their stipulated performance time<br/>lying between midday-midnight, have their vadi (consonant) in<br/>poorvanga (lower tetrachord). Thus, for example, the vadi of an<br/>evening raga will be one of Sa (C), Re komala (D flat), Re shuddha<br/>(D), Ga komala (E flat), Ga shuddha (E), Ma shuddha (F)  Pa (G) is<br/>also included here.</p><p>So, if you know the vadi of a raga, you know when to perform it.</p><p>(2)  Ma shuddha (F) and Ma teevra (F#)-- the adhva-darshaka (path-<br/>indicator) notes.</p><p>    (i)  Broadly, the shuddha Ma (F) is indicative of morning time;<br/>teevra MA (F#), of evening time.</p><p>    (ii)  Komala Re (D flat) and komala Dha (A flat) -- this<br/>combination, with shuddha Ma (F), indicates the sunrise time; with<br/>teevra Ma (F#), indicates the sunset time. Examples:- Morning time<br/>raga-s include Bhairava, Kalingada, Jogiya; Evening raga-s include<br/>Poorvi. Marwa is also an evening raga, but has a shuddha Dha (A).<br/>These raga-s are classified as &quot;sandhi-prakasha&quot; (twilight) raga-s,<br/>i.e. the raga-s performed at the time when the light and the darkness<br/>meet.</p><p>(3)  The Time Cycle in relation to Ma (F/F#).</p><p>    (i)  Teevra Ma (F#) is introduced as early as in the fourth<br/>watch, 3 pm-6pm, as in the raga Multani.</p><p>   (ii)  It continues through the evening twilight raga-s, Poorvi,<br/>Marwa.</p><p>   (iii) Teevra Ma (F#) then goes on to the night first watch, 6 pm-9<br/>pm, as in the raga-s Yaman, Hameer, Kamod.</p><p>   (iv)  In the night second watch, 9 pm-12 midnight, it persists in<br/>the raga like Bihag, but NOW shuddha Ma (F) is introduced.  Thus we<br/>have both Ma (F# and F) in Bihag. Pass through Khamaj, Desh, Tilak<br/>kamod, jayajayavanti; thenbageshri, Adana, darbari, Malkaus.  Now we<br/>again have teevra Ma (F#) beginning to show in Vasanta and Paraj.<br/>This indicates that the dawn is not far.</p><p>    (v)  And, so, we are taken to morning twilight raga-s: Kalingada<br/>and Bhairava, as indicated above.</p><p>   (vi)  Then, teevra Ma (F#) is  re-introduced, but with shuddha Ma<br/>(F) dominating, as in the raga-s Ramkali and Lalit.</p><p>   (vii)  Following this, shuddha Ma (F) dominates, now with shuddha<br/>Re (D)-shuddha Dha (A) combination.  As in Bilawal, for example.</p><p>  (viii)  Now the komala Ga (E flat)-komala NI (B flat) combination<br/>takes over, as in Bhimpalasi.</p><p>    (ix)  Now, gently, teevra Ma (F#) is re-introduced, taking us<br/>back to Multani.</p><p>(4)  Summary.  Let us follow, this time, the all-inclusive Yaman-to-<br/>Yaman cycle.  Typical examples have been included.</p><p>   (i)  Raga-s with teevra Ma (F#).  Yaman, shuddha kalyan, Bhupali.</p><p>  (ii) Raga-s with both Ma (F and F#).  Hameer, Kedara, Kamod,<br/>Chhayanat, Bihag.</p><p>  (iii)  Raga-s with shuddha Ga (E) and komala Ni (B flat).  Khamaj,<br/>Desh, Tilak kamod, Jayajayavanti. Note: Jayajayavanti has both Ga (E<br/>flat and E); thus it gently leads to the next category of raga-s with<br/>komala Ga (E flat) and komala Ni (B flat).  Hence Jayajayavanti is<br/>known as &quot;para-mela-praveshaka&quot; (leading to the next scale type).</p><p>  (iv)  Raga-s with komala Ga (E flat) and komala Ni (B flat).<br/>Bageshri, Adana, Darbari, Miya malhar, Malkaus.  Note: In the<br/>following category, teevra Ma (F#) is gently re-introduced.  This<br/>indicates that we will be led to the morning twilight (dawn) in the<br/>next stage.</p><p>   (v)  Raga-s with komala Re (D flat) and komala Dha (A flat).<br/>Sohani [has shuddha Dha (A)], Vasant, Paraj.</p><p>  (vi)  Raga-s with komala Re (D flat), komala Dha (A flat) and<br/>shuddha Ma (F).  See generalisation #3 (v).  Bhairava, Kalingada,<br/>Jogiya.</p><p>  (vii) Raga-s with both Ma (F and F#), with shuddha Ma (F)<br/>dominating.  See #3 (vi). Ramkali, Lalit.</p><p>  (viii)  Raga-s with shuddha Re (D), shuddha Dha (A), shuddha Ma(F).<br/>See #3 (vii). Bilawal, Deshakar [which omits Ma (F)].</p><p>   (ix)  The raga-s with komala Re (D flat), komala Ga (E flat),<br/>komala Dha (A flat), and teevra Ma (F#).  All types of Todi [like<br/>Gurjari, Miya ki Todi, Bahaduri, but NOT Bilaskhani, Lachari,<br/>perhaps, Bhupal].</p><p>   (x)  Raga-s with komala Ga (E flat), komala Dha (A flat), and<br/>komala Ni (B flat).  Jaunpuri, Asavari.</p><p>   (xi)  Raga-s with shuddha and very prominent Re (D), one or both<br/>Ni (B flat/B), very prominent Pa (G), and OMIT Ga (E).  This is the<br/>Sarang group of raga-s.  All Sarang raga types [ Vrindavani, shuddha,<br/>Madhyamadi, Miya ki Sarang, Samant, Badahansa, Lankadahana].</p><p>   (xii)  Raga-s with komala Ga (E flat), komala Ni (B flat).<br/>Bhimpalasi, Dhani.  See #3 (viii).</p><p>   (xiii)  Raga-s with komala Ga (E flat), shuddha Ni (B), and teevra<br/>Ma (F#).  Multani.  See #3 (i).<br/>Multani takes us gently from E flat-B flat combination in Bhimpalasi,<br/>to E flat- B combination, via F#, into the evening twilight ragas<br/>[see below #4 (xiv)].  So Multani is a para-mela-praveshaka (leading<br/>to the next scale type) raga.  See Jayajayavanti #4 (iii).</p><p>  (xiv)  The Twilight Raga-s.  See #3 (ii).  Poorvi, Marwa, Shri.</p><p>And, so, we are back to Yaman in the next step.</p><p>(5) Exceptions.  Certain exceptions are permitted to the Time<br/>theory.  You can sing any raga at any time, during abhyasa-gana<br/>(singing for daily study), when the King orders you to, when your<br/>Guru wants you to, on occasions like wedding, offering hymns to the<br/>deity,  at your (singer&apos;s) pleasure (not during a formal performance,<br/>as on the stage), when singing all-time raga-s like Bhairavi, Piloo,<br/>Pahadi, Jhinjhoti, as well as the raga-mala (a composition which<br/>includes several raga-s as a string of raga-s).</p><p>(6)  Conclusion.</p><p>As of now, we seem to have failed to see anything fundamental about<br/>this theory, though I feel intuitively, that we are missing something<br/>of immense value.</p><p>My hope is that this will help amplify our views on the question of<br/>Time theory. Typing is not one of my strong points -- I hope there<br/>are no misleading errors.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p><p>Jarring note: Yahoo appears to believe in Timeless theory, otherwise<br/>how does it take infinity to load?!</p></div>
