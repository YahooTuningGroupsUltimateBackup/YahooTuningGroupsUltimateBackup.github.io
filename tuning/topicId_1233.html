At the same time,<br/>before getting more into this historical question, I&apos;d like to thank<br/>Daniel for a fascinating discussion of some of the factors that can<br/>make 9:7 seem more &quot;concordant&quot; in a 20th-century setting, such as<br/>pitch range. I&apos;d agree that the typical range of Gothic music, say<br/>G-e&apos;&apos;, is likely too low to approach the pitch region of greater<br/>perceived concord.</p><p>As Daniel notes, the tuning of the major third expanding conjunctly to<br/>the fifth (e.g. e-g# to d-a) near 9:7 is suggested by Marchettus of<br/>Padua (1318). He belongs to an Italian branch of the _early_ Ars Nova,<br/>as opposed to the _Ars subtilior_ or Manneristic epoch near the _end_<br/>of the Ars Nova, the Ars Nova as a totality being roughly synonymous<br/>with the musical &quot;14th century&quot; (say 1300-1420, or de Vitry to the<br/>earliest Dufay).</p><p>It is possible to find one allusion in a short treatise on vocal<br/>intonation in the Berkeley Manuscript or Paris Anonymous, part dated<br/>to 1375, which _might_ imply a cadential M3 close to 9:7. Dividing a<br/>whole-tone into three parts, this author advocates 2/3-tone for the<br/>usual mi-fa semitone, but 1/3-tone for cadential semitones.<br/>Unfortunately, this treatise directly covers only the intonation of a<br/>single vocal line, not vertical intervals. One modern editor, Oliver<br/>Ellsworth, has incidentally read this treatise as a proposal for<br/>19-tet.</p><p>However, focusing on the style of both French and Italian music in<br/>this late medieval epoch of &quot;Mannerism&quot; around 1400, I tend to suspect<br/>that the most likely tuning for M3 would be either the standard<br/>Pythagorean 81:64, or possibly at some places the 8192:6561 which may<br/>have already been coming into vogue for sonorities with written sharps<br/>tuned on a keyboard instrument as flats (e.g. e-g# tuned as e-ab).<br/>This is a &quot;schisma third&quot; of about 384.36 cents, only a schisma of<br/>about 1.95 cents from a pure 5:4 at about 386.31 cents.</p><p>In fact, if we see the transition as underway by around 1400, as Mark<br/>Lindley suggests, then it falls within the Ars subtilior or<br/>&quot;Manneristic&quot; era. For a composer such as Ciconia or possibly the aged<br/>Landini (1325-1397), a tendency to realize many cadential thirds and<br/>sixths involving sharps as virtually pure might point to a direction<br/>which seems rather than opposite of a tuning closer to 9:7.</p><p>Interestingly, the question here is not only whether Landini himself<br/>may have intended such a tuning, as opposed to the more traditional<br/>Pythagorean tuning still championed by Prosdocimus in the early 15th<br/>century, with M3 consistently at 81:64 and m3 at 32:27. Whatever<br/>Landini himself may have had in mind, the new keyboard tunings around<br/>1400 would give late 14th-century pieces an altered harmonic &quot;color&quot;<br/>-- evidently one much liked by the &quot;moderns.&quot;</p><p>In short, while Marchettus and possibly the later &quot;third-tone&quot;<br/>treatise in the Berkeley Manuscript suggest the use of a cadential<br/>major third not far from 9:7, the general sensibility of the medieval<br/>Manneristic epoch around 1400 suggests the use of more concordant<br/>values: either the traditional 81:64, or the diminished fourth at<br/>8192:6561. By around 1450, as Lindley and others have discussed, the<br/>8192:6561 (~5:4) rendition had apparently become so popular that it<br/>led to meantone tunings seeking to make such thirds available in as<br/>many locations as possible.</p><p>Moving now to the &quot;Manneristic&quot; Era in the sense of what is often<br/>known as Late Renaissance and Early Baroque (c. 1540-1640), or from de<br/>Rore through Monteverdi, say, we come to a setting where I would also<br/>agree with Daniel that 9:7 is unlikely as a direct vertical interval,<br/>except possibly as a deliberate &quot;Wolf&quot; (indeed the 32:25 of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, at about 427 cents, is quite close to 9:7). Note that the<br/>augmented _fifth_, or 25:16, close to 14:9, does sometimes occur as a<br/>&quot;special effect,&quot; and here both upper notes are concordant with the<br/>bass:</p><p>f#&apos;<br/>bb<br/>d</p><p>It is true that the diminished fourth (e.g. f-c#) occurs as a<br/>_melodic_ interval, at any rate, in Wert and Monteverdi, for example<br/>-- something that Artusi criticizes in the latter&apos;s madrigals,<br/>although he finds it acceptable for a 12-tet lute. Just how singers<br/>would have tuned this interval is an interesting question.</p><p>Vicentino (1555), whom I would call a &quot;Mannerist&quot; in the best sense,<br/>discusses approximations of both the 11:9 (&quot;5 1/2:4 1/2&quot;), or<br/>essentially 9/31 octave (~348 cents); and the 9:7 (&quot;4 1/2: 3 1/2&quot;), or<br/>essentially 11/31 octave (~426 cents). Note that he takes his<br/>archicembalo based on a 1/5-tone tempered tuning -- essentially 31-tet<br/>-- as the standard for the new vocal as well as instrumental music<br/>which he advocates. He himself recognizes that a standard meantone<br/>tuning, or more specifically 1/4-comma with pure 5:4 major thirds, is<br/>virtually a subset of this tuning -- we might say &quot;12 out of 31.&quot;</p><p>His conclusion is that 9/31 octave, a &quot;proximate minor third,&quot; is<br/>rather concordant. He describes it as a minor third tending toward a<br/>major third, the latter being a prime concord; therefore it not<br/>surprisingly tends toward a concordant effect.</p><p>With 11/31 octave, a &quot;proximate major third,&quot; he finds the effect not<br/>so good: this is a major third tending toward a fourth, the latter<br/>interval in a Renaissance context having an equivocal status,<br/>sometimes being treated in theory and practice either a discord<br/>(especially in relation to the lowest voice) or a concord. Thus the<br/>proximate major third, being somewhat &quot;fourthlike,&quot; may take on the<br/>equivocal character of this interval.</p><p>In principle, Vicentino holds that _any_ interval or combination may<br/>be useful to express an appropriate text -- a position similar to that<br/>of the Monteverdi brothers half a century later (1607). Thus it is<br/>possible to imagine using the 9:7 or 32:25 or 11/31 octave in some<br/>expressive setting, and winning Vicentino&apos;s appropriation; but I don&apos;t<br/>recall him doing this himself.</p><p>Now for Daniel&apos;s very important point, if I read it correctly, that<br/>although the vertical 9:7 doesn&apos;t seem to be associated with<br/>historical &quot;Manneristic styles&quot; (late 14th century or 16th-17th<br/>century), there&apos;s no reason it _couldn&apos;t_ be featured in some new<br/>Mannerism.</p><p>As it happens, the harmonic trends around 1400 or 1550 weren&apos;t<br/>especially favorable to the emergence of 9:7 as a favored vertical<br/>interval; the _melodic_ diminished fourth (close to 9:7 in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone or 31-tet), however, does take a prominent role in late<br/>16th-century music.</p><p>In a late 20th-century or early 21st-century setting, I see no reason<br/>why 9:7 might not be used in a &quot;Manneristic&quot; fashion.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
