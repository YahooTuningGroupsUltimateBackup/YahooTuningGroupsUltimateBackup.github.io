It&apos;s<br/>essentially a chain of fifths from Bbb to C## (i.e. from 8 flats to 9<br/>sharps). The interesting thing is that all the fifths are smaller than the<br/>just 3/2 - some by 1/9 of the Pyth. comma, others by its 2/9 or 3/9 (= 1/3).<br/>The tempering is so strong that it behaves much more like a meantone rather<br/>than a positive or well-temperament. So this is my first quasi-meantone<br/>tuning which is not made purely of rational intervals but is mostly<br/>irrational because the basic tempering unit here is 1/9 of the Pyth. comma.<br/>Here is the &quot;key-to-degree&quot; mapping for the two manuals. The degree 24 (or<br/>0) should be C. The keys are numbered from 1 (meaning the C# key) to 12<br/>(meaning the C key). The symbol &quot;U&quot; stands for &quot;upper manual&quot; and &quot;L&quot; stands<br/>for &quot;lower manual&quot;.</p><p>Degree  Key     Manual<br/> 1       1      U<br/> 2       1      L<br/> 3       2      L<br/> 4       2      U<br/> 5       3      L<br/> 6       3      U<br/> 7       4      U<br/> 8       4      L<br/> 9       5      L<br/>10       5      U<br/>11       6      U<br/>12       6      L<br/>13       7      L<br/>14       7      U<br/>15       8      U<br/>16       8      L<br/>17       9      U<br/>18       9      L<br/>19      10      L<br/>20      10      U<br/>21      11      U<br/>22      11      L<br/>23      12      L<br/>24      12      U</p><p>! qmtp.scl<br/>!<br/>Quasi-meantone irrational tuning with 1/9 Pyth. comma as basic tempering<br/>unit<br/>!August 2004 - Petr Parizek<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 74.58499<br/> 121.50501<br/> 151.77665<br/> 196.09000<br/> 268.06832<br/> 314.98834<br/> 8192/6561<br/> 43046721/33554432<br/> 461.55165<br/> 505.86500<br/> 580.44999<br/> 627.37001<br/> 652.42831<br/> 699.34833<br/> 67108864/43046721<br/> 6561/4096<br/> 890.22500<br/> 934.53835<br/> 967.41665<br/> 1011.73001<br/> 1083.70833<br/> 1130.62835<br/> 1155.68665<br/> 2/1</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=55208 href="#55208">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2004 3:02:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&oslash;&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The tempering is so strong that it behaves much more like a meantone<br/>rather<br/>&gt; than a positive or well-temperament.</p><p>It seems to me it *is* a meantone; it is an irregular meantone on 24<br/>notes.

I knew about this possibility and<br/>therefore I decided to make such a temperament where the interval of C##-Bbb<br/>is close to 11/7. And what came out was just the temperament I sent here.<br/>Also, this tuning has many Pythagorean diminished fourths which are used as<br/>major thirds. This is an interesting similarity to a meantone with 1/4 Pyth.<br/>comma tempering (I think someone else has also mentioned this meantone but I<br/>don&apos;t know who it was, again).<br/>Petr</p></div>
