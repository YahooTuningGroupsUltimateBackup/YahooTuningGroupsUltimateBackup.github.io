You must have a &apos;canasta&apos; before you can<br/>go out.<br/>A Canasta is 7 cards of the same number, but &apos;wild&apos; cards (2&apos;s and<br/>jokers<br/>are allowed - you get less score for a canasta containing wild cards)<br/>are<br/>allowed. Depending on the game&apos;s progress, you need 50/90/120 points<br/>to go<br/>down (put something out of your hand onto the table) or to &apos;pick the<br/>pack&apos;.</p><p>Each player is dealt 11 cards to start the game.&quot;</p><p>Can anyone make a convincing case why MIRACLE-31 should be called<br/>Canasta, on the basis of the above.</p><p>Graham, you said something about how the lattice made you think of<br/>Canasta.

Amazingly, their<br/>names were not known in the US until after the game&apos;s popularity had<br/>peaked. Only then did American readers learn that attorney Segundo<br/>Santos and architect Alberto Serrato purposely set out to create the<br/>game that they soon named, whimsically, &quot;Canasta.&quot;</p><p>...</p><p>Santos had merely referred to it as &quot;The Game.&quot; But now, while<br/>sitting in a restaurant at their &quot;play-test&quot; table, he noticed the<br/>small wicker basket they had borrowed from a waiter to store their<br/>cards. &quot;Canastillo,&quot; he replied, matter-of-factly, which in Spanish<br/>means &quot;little basket.&quot;</p><p>A bit later, a suggestion was made to shortened it to &quot;Canasta&quot;<br/>(which means &quot;basket&quot;). This name was easy to say, and had a nice<br/>ring to it, thanks to the repetitive &quot;a&apos;s&quot; in its syllables<br/>(comparable to the repetitive &quot;o&apos;s&quot; in MONOPOLY).
