Of course, it would not be surprising at all to find they<br/>&gt; did. I had a question about Bach myself...I have read, in various<br/>&gt; places, that he had an interest in numerology; does anyone know anything<br/>&gt; about this? Was there some system he studied? How, if this is so, did it<br/>&gt; affect his composition? Any info would be appreciated.<br/>&gt;     A superb rendition of the Bach solo sonatas/partitas is by guitarist<br/>&gt; Kazuhito Yamashita...he also does the cello sonatas. Not only is the<br/>&gt; technique staggering, but the feeling, the emotional depth, is amazing.<br/>&gt; He&apos;s really playing on a deep level.<br/>&gt;     Speaking of guitarists, I just read a review of a guitarist named<br/>&gt; Adam Del Monte, who has a guitar fretted to meantone...has anyone heard<br/>&gt; his CD? I think that&apos;s a good thing....Hstick</p><p>Bach was into the kind of numerology where, for example, in the St. Matthew<br/>passion, in the chorus where it says the veil of the temple was rent, the<br/>tremolo in the bass has the # of notes equal to the verse number in the<br/>bible, etc. I did notice that the three sections of the Ciaconna are in<br/>rough golden mean relationship (proportion wise) but I doubt it was<br/>conscious. Bach&apos;s numerology was definitely the religious-symbolism variety.</p><p>No shit about Kazuhito, he&apos;s amazing. I heard him live once, and for the<br/>first few seconds my mind bugged out at the sound he was producing, it<br/>sounded more like a piano, and my brain would not match it to the image of a<br/>guy on stage with a guitar. Awesome. He&apos;s constantly adjusting the tuning<br/>while he&apos;s playing, reaching across w/ his right hand to tweak a peg in the<br/>middle of a passage. I wonder if some of it is trying to adjust ET to sound<br/>better as the harmonies change. I think most guitarists realize early on<br/>that there is no way to tune the third string so that both Cmajor and Emajor<br/>chords sound good, its one or the other. Of course it could be because all<br/>guitars are basically out of tune anyway, no matter what you do.</p><p>Never heard of Del Monte, but I&apos;m game to hear anything with discombobulated<br/>frets. I think Wim had his moveable fret guitar in meantone to play Dowland<br/>at the last Microthon. A guitar hard-fretted in a given meantone would kind<br/>of limit the pieces you could play, unless of course what you wanted to do<br/>was make up your own.</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3><a id=9770 href="#9770">ðŸ”—</a>ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU</h3><span>4/24/2000 10:50:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil Haverstick asked:<br/>&gt;I had a question about Bach myself...I have read, in various<br/>&gt;places, that he had an interest in numerology; does anyone know anything<br/>&gt;about this?

Any info would be appreciated.</p><p>All we have from a contemporary source is a brief mention that Bach enjoyed<br/>working with figures. Someone else discovered evidence of numerology in<br/>some of Bach&apos;s works. In one popular numerological pasttime, one assigns a<br/>letter the number of its place in the alphabet. (At the time I and J as<br/>well as U and V were considered the same for this purpose.) In that case,<br/>&quot;Bach&quot; adds up to 14, and &quot;J. S. Bach&quot; is 41, that is, a transposition of<br/>the digits. It turns out that 14 and 41 show up a lot in certain pieces --<br/>numbers of notes in a subject, measures in a piece, and so on. I read an<br/>extensive article on this topic based on someone&apos;s dissertation some time<br/>ago in the Bach Jahrbuch, but I have to say that it took these ideas very<br/>far afield indeed, finding evidence of some kind of number symbolism<br/>practically everywhere. What the author needed to do was some kind of<br/>statistical analysis to see if the many numerologically significant numbers<br/>identified were occuring more often than they would by chance.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
