I&apos;ve recently been working with an accomplished maker who had built me a pair of flutes in ET and JI.</p><p>There is general doubt in the Native American flute community that the differences can be heard, so I&apos;m thinking of an experiment -<br/>providing on-line versions of music in different tunings for people to compare and vote on. I believe I have techniques to<br/>compensate / control for differences in timbre between the two instruments (long story there), got the procedures to double-blind<br/>the test, and I&apos;ve got the statistical tools to analyze results.  So .</p><p>A) is this type of work within the scope of this group?</p><p>B) If so, we&apos;re thinking of the potential types of music to make comparisons with. Solo flute, solo over a drone, and solo over a<br/>repetitive piano ostinato (both ET and JI) are our initial thoughts. Any feedback on this?</p><p>-- Clint Goss</p></div><h3><a id=105750 href="#105750">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2013 11:30:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Clint,</p><p>&gt; A) is this type of work within the scope of this group?</p><p>Yes, absolutely!</p><p>&gt; B) If so, we&apos;re thinking of the potential types of music to make<br/>&gt; comparisons with.
