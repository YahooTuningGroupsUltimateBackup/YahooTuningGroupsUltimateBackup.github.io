In practice, the meantone is 1/4-comma,<br/>although I&apos;ve considered trying 2/7-comma (Zarlino&apos;s tuning) also.</p><p>Typically I divide my synthesizer sessions (with a Yahama TX-802 and<br/>two four-octave MIDI controllers which can be &quot;part-tuned&quot; to give<br/>virtual split keys) into a Pythagorean/medieval part and a<br/>Renaissance/meantone part.</p><p>From my perspective, a 12-tet major third (400 cents) is located<br/>between the meantone (5:4, 386 cents) and Pythagorean (81:64, 408<br/>cents) values. Thus it&apos;s just another possibility. All things being<br/>equal, it&apos;s a bit subdued for medieval (compared to 3-limit JI) and a<br/>bit active for Renaissance (compared to 5-limit JI or meantone), but<br/>acceptable to me for both in a pinch.</p><p>Then, again, my taste may be unusual, since I&apos;ve loved Gothic music<br/>for over 30 years, and at least one person here with a wide range of<br/>tuning interests has spoken of how strange it can sound to people with<br/>a strong triadic orientation.</p><p>However, that possible qualification duly noted, I must say that<br/>recently I played some Renaissance-style counterpoint on a 12-tet<br/>piano, and I found the sound interestingly &quot;different&quot; but not<br/>unpleasant, maybe like a photograph with a different touch of shading,<br/>but not a displeasing one.</p><p>A possible hypothesis: might 12-tet be more acceptable for those<br/>accustomed to both Pythagorean and meantone tunings, for whom it might<br/>be a kind of &quot;intermediate shade,&quot; as opposed to those oriented to<br/>tertian music in 5-limit or meantone, but not quintal/quartal music in<br/>Pythagorean?</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
