It seems right to me that fifths<br/>are more important than fourths, and major than minor thirds.  Perhaps<br/>if we optimized for prime ratios?  A lot of the problems with that in<br/>the octave-specific case magically fall away.  That is, if fifths and<br/>major thirds are both equally sharp, minor thirds will be just.  But<br/>if you shrink the octave, the major and minor thirds will improve, and<br/>minor thirds won&apos;t be that bad.
