Pointless exercises for<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt; now.</p><p>   I missed the beginning of this discussion, so perhaps I don&apos;t know the particular application.</p><p>   If your website is musically related, I can think of nothing more appropriate than putting music on it.  It seems hard to imagine a more effective way to share microtonal ideas with interested browsers.  As far as I can tell, RealAudio is the most accepted format for audio examples.  The quality is ... well, not superb, but decent, and most importantly, they don&apos;t have to wait around to download before they can hear it;  it starts playing immediately.</p><p>   I presume what you&apos;re actually saying though is that you don&apos;t find much value in flashing, blinking lights and other generic &quot;glitter&quot; in web page?  Assuming that that&apos;s your point, then I agree in concept, but not necessarily in practice.  The degree to which I don&apos;t agree is the same as for CD cover art.  Like it or not, people don&apos;t like to pay for a CD that doesn&apos;t have at least some flashiness in its presentation.  Similarly, web pages have to catch peoples&apos;<br/>attention.</p><p>   If I were preparing web pages for confirmed xenharmonics fans whom I know are interested in what those pages present, and I were directly calling their attention to them over Email, then I wouldn&apos;t pay much attention to the presentation.  If, on the other hand, I&apos;m trying to share cool new microtonal ideas with the public in general, I&apos;d certainly do all of the following:<br/>1.  Have lots of real musical examples.<br/>2.  Take as much advantage of graphical-visualization analogies as possible.<br/>3.  Organize and cross-index (i.e., link) the material as thoroughly as possible.<br/>4.  Present it attractively.<br/>5.  Make sure that my spelling and grammar is correct.<br/>6.  Register it with one or more search engines.</p><p>   If the vast majority of my web page&apos;s audience is going to get to it from a listing of 43 one-line summaries belched out by a search engine, then I have 43 good reasons to work hard to ensure that they&apos;ll give it more than a glance!</p></div>
