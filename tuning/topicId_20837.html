So as far as the hammer<br/>is concerned, all that matters is the speed at which it hits<br/>the string.</p><p>So this much of the conventional explanation of piano action<br/>is correct.</p><p>However, the damper is another matter. The sequence of actions<br/>as you hit a key is:</p><p>Hammer gets set in motion first</p><p>Then damper is released.</p><p>You can actually find a point in the action where the damper is<br/>released. Then if you play to just depress the keys to that point,<br/>and stop, you can play a totally damped note - you can do it<br/>in such a way that the damper never leaves the string.</p><p>It is quite possible to play a tune like that, and get<br/>a very soft totally muffled sound, unlike anything one usually<br/>hears on the piano. It can be loud but softly muffled, doesn&apos;t have<br/>to be quiet, just so long as you make sure that you stop pressing<br/>the key at the exact point where the damper release is triggered.</p><p>Now, if you play hitting the key slowly, and accelerate into<br/>the note, as one does for a note with a lot of attack, then<br/>this means you lift the damper very promptly.</p><p>One can do that so that as the hammer goes free moving quite<br/>slowly, and then you accelerate into the next part, to lift the<br/>damper, so that when the hammer hits the string, the damper is<br/>dotally raised from the string. Result is a note which can<br/>be very quiet, with a lot of attack.</p><p>The other way, if you hit the key fast, and then decelerate<br/>into the note, as one does when playing cantabile, then the<br/>damper is only beginning to leave the string as the hammer<br/>hits it. So you get a note with the beginning attack softened<br/>out. That way you can get even a loud note with very little<br/>in the way of attack, and it has a singing quality to it if<br/>you get it right.</p><p>There may be more to it than that, but that at least is<br/>enough to show that the piano touch is two dimensional,<br/>with attack and volume varying independently.</p><p>I remember I contacted a researcher who confirmed that<br/>modern analysis of piano touch was coming to this very<br/>conclusion, though I&apos;m afraid I forget the details.</p><p>Now for another interesting thing about it. It would be<br/>perfectly possible to design an electronic keyboard to<br/>vary in attack and volume in the same way, by using<br/>the same technique - to have two sensors, one for the<br/>release of the damper, and one for the velocity for<br/>the hammer.</p><p>Would add a new dimension to touch, and could also be used<br/>in a general way , not just to vary piano touch, but<br/>touch for any MIDI instrument. One could make the touch<br/>vary much more than it does for the piano if one wished,<br/>or indeed, make it more subtle.</p><p>So, why doesn&apos;t someone build such an instrument?</p><p>It isn&apos;t my field at all, I have nothing to do with<br/>building instruments, but I know many on this list do<br/>so maybe it will give them some ideas. I hope so!</p><p>I suppose chances are, someone else has thought of it<br/>before, but I&apos;ve never come across it.</p><p>Has anyone else come across this?</p><p>It even has microtonal significance (to show this isn&apos;t<br/>completely OT).</p><p>One could do it so that a note is made flatter or sharper<br/>instead depending on the amount of &quot;attack&quot;. Since pianists<br/>get good at playing a note with just the exact degree of<br/>cantabile or attack that they want, to a very fine degree,<br/>then one would have equally fine control over the amount<br/>of pitch bend, just by varying the way in which one<br/>played the note, either by accelerating into it, or<br/>decelerating into it.</p><p>Or indeed, one could vary any Midi controller the same<br/>way, just assign one of them to the attack (e.g. if one is<br/>happy to play in a fixed tuning).</p><p>So idea is, make a keyboard which outputs both velocity<br/>and a controller message, depending on the acceleration<br/>or deceleration into the note as one presses a key.</p><p>I think we&apos;d have heard of it by now if it had been done,<br/>as there are other designs for microtonal keyboards, but<br/>never seen this.</p><p>I&apos;m sure it will be done eventually, but perhaps I can<br/>help accelerate the process by mentioning the idea here.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2001 11:19:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi,</p><p>Actually, come to think of it, I think the damper is connected to<br/>the key directly by a string, or something of that sort. So one<br/>is almost completely in control of the way it leaves the string<br/>(though once it gets some impetus to leave the string, you can&apos;t<br/>stop it short again as the string pulls only).</p><p>If I remember correctly anyway.</p><p>So that makes it more than two dimensional, as one can make it<br/>so that the damper leaves the string slowly or quickly, and<br/>accelerate or not too as it leaves the string. That is about<br/>four dimensions already.</p><p>Might explain why pianists think they can also do many other kinds<br/>of touch, e.g. to play to sound like various instruments, rather<br/>than just attack and cantabile.</p><p>With the electronic keyboard, maybe just possibly this might mean<br/>it would be feasible to vary two or more controllers, by measuring<br/>the acceleration at various places in the key movement.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Jay Williams &#x3C;jaywill@tscnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2001 6:11:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&#x9;At 07:19 AM 4/9/01 +0100, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Hi,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Actually, come to think of it, I think the damper is connected to<br/>&gt;the key directly by a string, or something of that sort.
