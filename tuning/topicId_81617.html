And it looks like music. Can&apos;t fully explain it yet, too much<br/>&gt; &gt; research to still do, I will post it later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please do post about this. But be prepared for critisism :-)</p><p>Ok I will post a small part of it :)<br/>I&apos;m not afraid of critisism, if I can&apos;t agree with the critisism I have no<br/>problem with it, if I can agree with the ciritisism I will learn from it.<br/>Similar to how critisism on my mess of Lasso made me realise something about<br/>retuning sounding notes in JI in a score written in 12tet (which I&apos;ll<br/>revisit later)</p><p>Ok so here&apos;s part of the thing I discovered.</p><p>I think that music is allways about harmony (the tonal part) and can&apos;t<br/>escape from harmony unless it&apos;s noise.<br/>Not even monophonic melody can escape harmony since every note is judged<br/>against its preceding note even though they don&apos;t sound at thesame time.</p><p>Now harmony is infinite in it&apos;s possibilities of construction.<br/>But to try to understand harmony I tried to rate harmony from the most<br/>simple contruction to more complex contructions.<br/>For this I looked at the harmonic overtone series as it is the most perfect<br/>harmonic construction possible.<br/>It is also rateable from simple to more complex. seen from 1/1 you get 1/1<br/>2/1 simplest, 1/1 2/1 3/1 next simplest, 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 next simplest, etc.<br/>When looking at the harmonic series I can see different parts of it that<br/>make it perfect.<br/>First the consecutive parts of 2/1 3/2 4/3 etc, and the order from big to<br/>small.<br/>There are more parts and reasons i can see that make it perfect but i&apos;ll<br/>keep this mail small.</p><p>Now if one takes one part that makes the harmonic overtone series<br/>construction perfect, namely that it is constructed from ever smaller<br/>intervals, then you can construct a different series by reshifting the<br/>order.<br/>This retains the ever smaller interval size perfection and simplest to more<br/>complex ordering that comes with it. It loses the order perfection.<br/>So this new series goes like this: simplest 1/1 2/1, next simplest 1/1 2/1<br/>3/1 and 1/1 3/2 3/1. both having thesame source of 1/1.<br/>first one is 1/1 + 2/1 + 3/2, second one is 1/1 + 3/2 + 2/1.<br/>put one on top of the other and you get 1/1 3/2 2/1 3/1<br/>next simplest harmonic construction is 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 (1/1 + 2/1 + 3/2 +<br/>4/3) which also becomes 1/1 3/2 2/1 4/1 (1/1 + 3/2 + 4/3 + 2/1), and 1/1 2/1<br/>8/3 4/1 (1/1 + 2/1 + 4/3 + 3/2), and 1/1 4/3 2/1 4/1 (1/1 + 4/3 + 3/2 +<br/>2/1).<br/>These are all the possible orderings when going till the 4th harmonic.<br/>All on top of eachother they give 1/1 4/3 3/2 2/1 8/3 3/1 4/1<br/>Please note that I&apos;m not bringing everything down into 1 octave.</p><p>If you go untill the 5th harmonic you get this:</p><p>1/1 2/1 3/1  4/1  5/1  1-2-3-4-5<br/>1/1 3/2 3/1  4/1  5/1  1-3-2-4-5<br/>1/1 3/2 2/1  4/1  5/1  1-3-4-2-5<br/>1/1 3/2 2/1  5/2  5/1  1-3-4-5-2<br/>1/1 2/1 8/3  4/1  5/1  1-2-4-3-5<br/>1/1 2/1 8/3  10/3 5/1  1-2-4-5-3<br/>1/1 4/3 8/3  4/1  5/1  1-4-2-3-5<br/>1/1 4/3 8/3  10/3 5/1  1-4-2-5-3<br/>1/1 4/3 5/3  10/3 5/1  1-4-5-2-3<br/>1/1 4/3 2/1  4/1  5/1  1-4-3-2-5<br/>1/1 4/3 2/1  5/2  5/1  1-4-3-5-2<br/>1/1 4/3 5/3  5/2  5/1  1-4-5-3-2<br/>1/1 2/1 3/1  15/4 5/1  1-2-3-5-4<br/>1/1 2/1 5/2  15/4 5/1  1-2-5-3-4<br/>1/1 5/4 5/2  15/4 5/1  1-5-2-3-4<br/>1/1 3/2 3/1  15/4 5/1  1-3-2-5-4<br/>1/1 3/2 15/8 15/4 5/1  1-3-5-2-4<br/>1/1 3/2 15/8 5/2  5/1  1-3-5-4-2<br/>1/1 5/4 15/8 15/4 5/1  1-5-3-2-4<br/>1/1 5/4 15/8 5/2  5/1  1-5-3-4-2<br/>1/1 2/1 5/2  10/3 5/1  1-2-5-4-3<br/>1/1 5/4 5/2  10/3 5/1  1-5-2-4-3<br/>1/1 5/4 5/3  10/3 5/1  1-5-4-2-3<br/>1/1 5/4 5/3  5/2  5/1  1-5-4-3-2</p><p>With all harmonic constructions put on top of eachother you get this: 1/1<br/>5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 5/2 8/3 3/1 10/3 15/4 4/1 5/1</p><p>Now this is harmonic structure simplicity in the way i described it.<br/>It does not mean that every one of those harmonies is the most simple or<br/>consonant harmony, since we abandoned the perfect ordering of the harmonic<br/>series.<br/>Of the above only 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 has the perfect ordering. Nonetheless<br/>all the above harmonic structures are simplest and most perfect in their<br/>interval sizes construction.</p><p>Btw the number of different base harmonic structures for the above 5th<br/>harmonic limit structure is 1*2*3*4 = 24<br/>If one counts all the number of pitches (non unique) making up those<br/>harmonic structures the number is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120</p><p>Now if one takes this structure to the 6th harmonic you get:</p><p>1*2*3*4*5 = 120 different harmonic structures.<br/>Comprised of 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720 non unique notes.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to paste this list of 120 harmonic constructions here now for<br/>the readability of this email, I&apos;ll paste it in the next message.</p><p>When you put all the harmonic structures on top of eachother you get:<br/>1/1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 9/4 12/5 5/2 8/3 3/1 16/5 10/3 18/5<br/>15/4 4/1 9/2 24/5 5/1 6/1</p><p>When you look at for instance the octave from 2/1 till 4/1 you see:<br/>1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1</p><p>Now these are the most simple harmonic structures based on interval sizes.<br/>But without any ordering, infact with every possible ordering.</p><p>To work with these one still has take into account ordering.<br/>Now we make a simple ordering division into this list of harmonic<br/>structures.<br/>We devide the list into 2 lists first.</p><p>1 list is all the different orderings of interval sizes except the 5/4 then<br/>6/5 order we find in the harmonic series.<br/>So the below list is allways 4:5:6, the rest of the intervals still have all<br/>possible orders.<br/>You get:<br/>1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 9/4 5/2 8/3 3/1 10/3 15/4 4/1 9/2 5/1 6/1<br/>Seen in 1 octave (or from 2/1) you get:<br/>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1</p><p>Now this is the major scale!</p><p>When you now do the oposite, namely order it with first 6/5 then 5/4 then<br/>you get:<br/>1/1 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 9/5 2/1 9/4 12/5 8/3 3/1 16/5 18/5 4/1 9/2 24/5 6/1<br/>Seen in 1 octave (or from 2/1) you get:<br/>1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 9/5 2/1</p><p>This is the minor scale!</p><p>And not only did we get the major and minor scale, we got them including<br/>every single on of their most simple interval based harmonic structures.<br/>(we did not get more complex harmonic structures which can also underly<br/>these scales, the list of which is infinite, though we can list the &quot;next<br/>simplest&quot;)</p><p>So we can see these scales as coming from the most simple harmonic<br/>structures in which you can reverse the ordering of the harmonic overtone<br/>series, but not reverse the order of 5/4 + 6/5 in the scale (or while<br/>playing).<br/>Simplest reversion would be the octave, next simplest the 3rd harmonic, next<br/>simplest 4th harmonic next simplest 5th harmonic, next simplest 6th<br/>harmonic.<br/>The reversion of the 6th harmonic we don&apos;t seem to like a lot.<br/>Not only seen from the scales above, but play 1/1 5/4 3/2 then 1/1 6/5 3/2.<br/>It&apos;s not pretty.<br/>The reversion of the 5th harmonic is allready a bit strong, play 1/1 4/3 5/3<br/>then 1/1 5/4 5/3.<br/>(please note these are &quot;reversions&quot; or whatever they should be called, not<br/>inversions)</p><p>Ok I&apos;m tired of typing for right now, bussy day but I&apos;ll add a lot to this<br/>later.<br/>Below I&apos;ll paste the diatonic major and minor scales seen from all their<br/>different degrees (which can all function as a tonal center, though none as<br/>good as the 1/1 of the harmonic structure offcourse)<br/>Also below are diatonic like scales based on thesame harmonic structure of<br/>the 6th harmonic but with slightly different ordering rules.<br/>Also soon i&apos;ll explain harmonic interval structures of higher harmonics,<br/>this is where it gets even more interesting :)</p><p>Base Modes:</p><p>mode 1 (major)<br/>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/> 9/8 : 10/9  32/27 4/3   40/27 5/3   16/9 2/1<br/> 5/4 :

I would be<br/>&gt; interested what the results are.</p><p>Dear Hans and Marcel,</p><p>I have been working on extending this theory to the 7-limit and higher<br/>limits, and I have found a very interesting and quick way to construct<br/>these scales (much quicker than listing all permutations, and gives<br/>the identical result). I am going to illustrate this algorithm using<br/>the example of finding the scale of all permutations of 2/1 3/2 4/3<br/>5/4 6/5 7/6 8/7.

For example, the familiar<br/>major and minor scale were created in Step 6, essentially by taking the<br/>scale obtained in Step 6:<br/>1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8<br/>and tempering out the comma 25:24 to obtain a 7 note scale:<br/>1/1 9/8 (6/5,5/4) 4/3 3/2 (8/5,5/3) (9/5,15/8)<br/>Selecting the higher member of each equivalence class gives rise to the<br/>major scale, and selecting the lower member of each equivalence class<br/>gives rise to the major scale.<br/>I can now do the same thing with, for example, Step 8:</p><p>1/1 36/35 21/20 16/15 15/14 35/32 10/9 9/8 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 9/7 21/16 4/3<br/>48/35 7/5 10/7 35/24 3/2 32/21 14/9 8/5 5/3 12/7 7/4 16/9 9/5 64/35<br/>28/15 15/8 40/21 35/18 2/1</p><p>Instead of tempering out 25/24, I temper out 49/48 and select the<br/>pitches accordingly, giving:</p><p>1/1 21/20 16/15 35/32 10/9 9/8 7/6 6/5 5/4 21/16 4/3 7/5 35/24 3/2 14/9<br/>8/5 5/3 7/4 16/9 9/5 28/15 15/8 35/18 2/1</p><p>This is a 7-limit equivalent of the &quot;major scale&quot; (however it is not<br/>really useful as a melodic construct because of its large number, 23, of<br/>tones). The minor scale is obtained by replacing every 7 in the ratios<br/>with 48/7, or alternately, inverting the whole scale around the 1/1-2/1<br/>axis.</p><p>This works with any step number, so at Step n, I temper out the comma<br/>(n-1)^2 / n(n - 2). However, there is a challenge when the step number<br/>(n) is odd, namely, there is a note in the tuning that is a comma lower<br/>than unison. So the &quot;minor scale&quot; would end up omitting the unison. This<br/>is not a big issue, however, because the whole scale can be transposed<br/>up a comma without problem.</p><p>By the way, just as Erv Wilson&apos;s hexany and its analogs are called<br/>&quot;combination-product sets&quot; (CPS), can these types of scales be called<br/>&quot;permutation-product sets&quot; (PPS)? This is just a suggestion. Then I<br/>could describe Marcel&apos;s theory of JI scales in one succinct sentence,<br/>along these lines: &quot;The 6-step PPS consists of the major and minor<br/>scales on a common tonic.&quot;</p><p>Justin Tone</p><p>-P.S. As a side note, it must be possible to create new PPS&apos;s by<br/>skipping some harmonics in the overtone series. For example, 2/1 3/2 4/3<br/>7/6 8/7 9/8 would give the following 16-tone PPS:</p><p>  1/1 9/8 8/7 7/6 9/7 21/16 4/3 3/2 32/21 14/9 27/16 12/7 7/4 16/9 27/14<br/>63/32 2/1</p><p>This may create new and useful resources in microtonal composition.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------\<br/>-------------</p><p>&gt; I have been working on extending this theory to the 7-limit and higher<br/>&gt; limits, and I have found a very interesting and quick way to construct<br/>&gt; these scales (much quicker than listing all permutations, and gives<br/>&gt; the identical result). I am going to illustrate this algorithm using<br/>&gt; the example of finding the scale of all permutations of 2/1 3/2 4/3<br/>&gt; 5/4 6/5 7/6 8/7.

In this case, one arrives at 1/1<br/>3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; STEP 4: Transpose this scale by the next interval in the list (namely,<br/>&gt; 4/3), and combine with the original (1/1 3/2).<br/>&gt; So one arrives at 1/1 4/3 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; STEP 5: Transpose this scale by the next interval in the list (namely,<br/>&gt; 5/4), and combine with the original (1/1 4/3 3/2).<br/>&gt; So one arrives at 1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; STEP 6: Transpose this scale by the next interval in the list (namely,<br/>&gt; 6/5), and combine with the original (1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8).<br/>&gt; So one arrives at 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 (this is<br/>&gt; just the combination of the major and minor scales).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; STEP 7: Transpose this scale by the next interval in the list (namely,<br/>&gt; 7/6), and combine with the original (1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3<br/>&gt; 9/5 15/8).<br/>&gt; So one arrives at 1/1 21/20 35/32 9/8 7/6 6/5 5/4 21/16 4/3 7/5 35/24<br/>&gt; 3/2 14/9 8/5 5/3 7/4 9/5 28/15 15/8 35/18<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; STEP 8: Transpose this scale by the next (and last) interval in the<br/>&gt; list (namely, 8/7), and combine with the original (1/1 21/20 35/32 9/8<br/>&gt; 7/6 6/5 5/4 21/16 4/3 7/5 35/24 3/2 14/9 8/5 5/3 7/4 9/5 28/15 15/8<br/>&gt; 35/18).<br/>&gt; One finally arrives at the following 33-tone scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 36/35 21/20 16/15 15/14 35/32 10/9 9/8 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 9/7 21/16<br/>&gt; 4/3 48/35 7/5 10/7 35/24 3/2 32/21 14/9 8/5 5/3 12/7 7/4 16/9 9/5<br/>&gt; 64/35 28/15 15/8 40/21 35/18 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the scale that one obtains when combining all permutations of<br/>&gt; 2/1 3/2 4/3 5/4 6/5 7/6 8/7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have used this algorithm to create an equivalent scale for the 11<br/>&gt; limit, using harmonics 1-12 (essentially I added four more steps,<br/>&gt; transposing at the 9/8, 10/9, 11/10 and 12/11).

For example, the familiar<br/>&gt; major and minor scale were created in Step 6, essentially by taking the<br/>&gt; scale obtained in Step 6:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8<br/>&gt; and tempering out the comma 25:24 to obtain a 7 note scale:<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 (6/5,5/4) 4/3 3/2 (8/5,5/3) (9/5,15/8)<br/>&gt; Selecting the higher member of each equivalence class gives rise to the<br/>&gt; major scale, and selecting the lower member of each equivalence class gives<br/>&gt; rise to the major scale.</p><p>Yes this seems to be the easyest way to do it practically but it doesn&apos;t<br/>make enough sense to me in a more abstract logical way.<br/>I still prefer to do it by setting a rule of order in which the harmonic<br/>intervals 5/4 and 6/5 have to follow eachother in the underlying harmonies<br/>of the scales. 5/4 before 6/5 is major, 6/5 before 5/4 is minor.<br/>You get the 25/24 stepsize in melodies only when switching the order of 5/4<br/>and 6/5 in the underlying harmonies.<br/>This only concerns melodies.<br/>I do think 25/24 is a perfectly valid stepsize in melodies, as is for<br/>instance 27/25. They&apos;re just one step more &quot;complex&quot; than 16/15.</p><p>&gt; I can now do the same thing with, for example, Step 8:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 36/35 21/20 16/15 15/14 35/32 10/9 9/8 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 9/7 21/16 4/3<br/>&gt; 48/35 7/5 10/7 35/24 3/2 32/21 14/9 8/5 5/3 12/7 7/4 16/9 9/5 64/35 28/15<br/>&gt; 15/8 40/21 35/18 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Instead of tempering out 25/24, I temper out 49/48 and select the pitches<br/>&gt; accordingly, giving:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 21/20 16/15 35/32 10/9 9/8 7/6 6/5 5/4 21/16 4/3 7/5 35/24 3/2 14/9 8/5<br/>&gt; 5/3 7/4 16/9 9/5 28/15 15/8 35/18 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a 7-limit equivalent of the &quot;major scale&quot; (however it is not really<br/>&gt; useful as a melodic construct because of its large number, 23, of tones).<br/>&gt; The minor scale is obtained by replacing every 7 in the ratios with 48/7, or<br/>&gt; alternately, inverting the whole scale around the 1/1-2/1 axis.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This should be thesame or almost thesame as setting a rule of order in the<br/>underlying harmonies of either 8/7 before 7/6 or the other way around.<br/>Btw I beleive the size of the scale and the small stepsizes you&apos;re getting<br/>is correct.<br/>After long thinking about how to use the 7th melodically I now think<br/>strongly that the 7th harmony is for very small stepsizes.<br/>The 5th and 6th harmonic have their limit, they ultimately build 12 tone<br/>scales.<br/>The 7th - 8th harmonics together with the lower harmonics seem to divide the<br/>12 tone 5-limit scales further into 24? tone scales.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This works with any step number, so at Step *n*, I temper out the comma (*<br/>&gt; n*-1)^2 / *n*(*n* - 2). However, there is a challenge when the step number<br/>&gt; (*n*) is odd, namely, there is a note in the tuning that is a comma lower<br/>&gt; than unison. So the &quot;minor scale&quot; would end up omitting the unison. This is<br/>&gt; not a big issue, however, because the whole scale can be transposed up a<br/>&gt; comma without problem.</p><p>This problem doesn&apos;t occur when doing this by limiting the order of the<br/>intervals in the underlying harmonies.<br/>However there does to me seem to be a bit of trouble with some chords giving<br/>for instance 81/40.<br/>Does this mean that we&apos;re supposed to build scales that are non octave<br/>repeating? Or does it mean this chord can only be played in large scales<br/>that have very narrow stepsizes? I think the 2nd one, and the chords that<br/>give 81/40 only start at the 9th harmonic.</p><p>By the way, just as Erv Wilson&apos;s hexany and its analogs are called<br/>&gt; &quot;combination-product sets&quot; (CPS), can these types of scales be called<br/>&gt; &quot;permutation-product sets&quot; (PPS)? This is just a suggestion. Then I could<br/>&gt; describe Marcel&apos;s theory of JI scales in one succinct sentence, along these<br/>&gt; lines: &quot;The 6-step PPS consists of the major and minor scales on a common<br/>&gt; tonic.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I do like the name :)<br/>However it may not make clear enough we&apos;re talking about permuations of the<br/>harmonic series. I don&apos;t want confusion and people starting to use thesame<br/>name for non harmonic permutation sets.<br/>How about HPPS :)</p><p>&gt; -P.S. As a side note, it must be possible to create new PPS&apos;s by skipping<br/>&gt; some harmonics in the overtone series. For example, 2/1 3/2 4/3 7/6 8/7 9/8<br/>&gt; would give the following 16-tone PPS:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  1/1 9/8 8/7 7/6 9/7 21/16 4/3 3/2 32/21 14/9 27/16 12/7 7/4 16/9 27/14<br/>&gt; 63/32 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This may create new and useful resources in microtonal composition.</p><p>I&apos;ve looked at this too, but now I use a different way of skipping certain<br/>steps.<br/>By not allowing for comma shifts in a composition I let the composition<br/>select the ratios from larger scales and make 12tone subset scales this way<br/>(based on all harmonies in the composition following the underlying harmonic<br/>structure that underlies this whole system)<br/>This gives both pure harmonies and pure melodies without shifts.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2009 10:25:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; By not allowing for comma shifts in a composition I let the composition<br/>&gt; select the ratios from larger scales and make 12tone subset scales this way<br/>&gt; (based on all harmonies in the composition following the underlying harmonic<br/>&gt; structure that underlies this whole system)<br/>&gt; This gives both pure harmonies and pure melodies without shifts.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This will work for 7-limit too offcourse.<br/>Probably giving 24-tone per octave subsets.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2009 6:04:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>After some more thought, I no longer think my theory is as relevant to music<br/>as I first thought.Maybe It&apos;ll have some use someday, but for now I&apos;m<br/>letting this one go.<br/>Enjoyed working on it though and don&apos;t regret all the work.</p><p>&gt;<br/>I&apos;m now going to work yet again on melody having its basis in segments of<br/>the harmonic series.<br/>Found a few new opening and things I appear to have done wrong when I left<br/>this line of thinking about a year ago.</p><p>Marcel</p></div>
