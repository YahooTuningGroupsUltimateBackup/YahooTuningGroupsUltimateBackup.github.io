I meant the diatonic scale of Western musical practice,<br/>since the advent of 5-limit harmony in the late 15th century. All<br/>_practical_ tuning systems for this music have tempered out the<br/>81:80. There is no difference between 9/8 and 10/9, not only<br/>physically in these tunings, but also conceptually in the music<br/>itself, that is, 99% of the common-practice and Renaissance<br/>repertoire. This point has been made exceptionally well by Daniel<br/>Wolf here in the past.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2001 7:47:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: Paul Erlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 06, 2001 11:15 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: BASIC: What was temperament again?<br/>&gt; (was: True nature of the blackjack scale (in 7-limit) . . . and more<br/>epimores)<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Klaus.
