I&apos;m using the TransFormSynth (or TFS for short), which transforms your QWERTY keyboard into an isomorphic keyboard with fingering invariance across all keys and tunings (within a given temperament), while also remapping the partials of your timbres to maximize sensory consonance (if you so choose).</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfliriA9ELQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfliriA9ELQ</a></p><p>This piece starts around 13-edo, and where the weird tuning shifts (called &quot;polyphonic tuning bends&quot;) start that&apos;s me bending from 13-edo, past 16-edo, to 19-edo, then back again a few times. I then finally zip past 19-edo and slide to the top end of the magic continuum, 3-edo. After the 3-edo section and some more polyphonic tuning bends, I slide to the opposite extreme in the magic temperament, 10-edo, and finish it out there.</p><p>I really like being able to apply a given fingering for a scale or chord, once I&apos;ve mastered it on the keyboard, to a whole range of related tunings. I can hear the similarity in function of each musical idea across the entire tuning continuum with all sorts of differences in nuance. Though I&apos;m not yet a master of dynamic tonality, I&apos;ve been having a lot of fun exploring =)</p><p>John Moriarty</p></div>
