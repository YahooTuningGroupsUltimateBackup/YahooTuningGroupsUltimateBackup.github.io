IMVHO, trying to make a &quot;fake&quot; real orchestra doesn&apos;t work as well as making a &quot;real&quot; fake orchestra.  Since the dawn of synthesizers, synth-programmers have sought to make simulacra of acoustic sounds, and while these sounds can be very nice, they never succeed in truly simulating the real thing.  To make good electronic music, the most successful approach always seems to be one that recognizes and accepts the fact that electronic devices are being used, instead of trying to disguise it.  At least for me personally, my music took a huge step forward when I decided to stop trying to &quot;fake&quot; the sound of a rock band and started emphasizing the electronic nature of my production techniques.  The Ethno2 demos contain many great cases-in-point: really well-composed music that falls flat because it unsuccessfully seeks to emulate acoustic music.  Toss a few obvious electronic tropes into some of those pieces, and they&apos;d really come alive!  These sample-sets can be really great, but only when taken as novel sounds unto themselves and not as simulacra.  Elsewise, the obvious fakeness of the sound obscures the brilliance of the underlying compositions.

Not a chance. Just a little bit of<br/>&gt; conspicuously-electronic &quot;flair&quot; would go a long way toward making &quot;software<br/>&gt; orchestras&quot; sound more palatable. If you&apos;re gonna make &quot;electronic&quot; music,<br/>&gt; why not play to the strengths of the medium? There&apos;s so much a computer can<br/>&gt; do that an orchestra can&apos;t. Listen to Venetian Snares&apos; &quot;My Downfall [OST]&quot;<br/>&gt; and you&apos;ll see what I mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Chris<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Thu, Jul 1, 2010 at 12:23 AM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Chris<br/>&gt; Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it costs money - but it is what people use instead of soundfonts<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these days as far as I know.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you discard having realistic sounds and go for synthetic sounds<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can still be completely free without too much trouble of course.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know how &quot;realistic&quot; GPO is, or any sample-based set of sounds.<br/>&gt; IMVHO, trying to make a &quot;fake&quot; real orchestra doesn&apos;t work as well as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Igs<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
