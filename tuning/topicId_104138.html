It&apos;s not difficult to see the rationale for this: (proper)<br/>MOS&apos;s can develop ambiguous intervals in one of 3 ways:</p><p>1) c gets too small, and you can&apos;t tell major and minor intervals apart anymore<br/>2) s gets too small, and you can&apos;t tell major seconds and minor thirds<br/>apart anymore (or intervals differing by s in general)<br/>3) d (= |s-c|) gets too small, and you can&apos;t tell apart anymore the<br/>intervals which Rothenberg called &quot;ambiguous&quot;</p><p>Note that all of these correlate to the MOS generator being tuned as a<br/>subset of some EDO. For example, as c approaches 0, an N note MOS<br/>starts approaching N-EDO. As s approaches 0, an N note MOS starts<br/>approaching whatever EDO it is when L/s = Inf. As d approaches 0, an N<br/>note MOS starts approaching whatever EDO it is when L/s = 2/1.</p><p>We can use this insight to consider the space of rank-2 tunings in<br/>general, without considering any particular MOS as being<br/>representative thereof. We&apos;ll generalize the above observations as<br/>follows:</p><p>1) The generators for MOS&apos;s ought to try and avoid simple rational<br/>divisions of the period.<br/>2) Being close to a very simple rational, i.e. a generator close to<br/>1/2-period, is worse than being close to a more complex rational, i.e.<br/>a generator close to 100/171-period, when considering the ambiguity of<br/>the MOS series at large.<br/>3) Very complex rationals don&apos;t matter at all, because sooner or later<br/>the MOS series will produce an MOS with so many notes that the whole<br/>thing is unavoidably self-ambiguous.</p><p>The first two criteria basically lead us to Erv Wilson&apos;s golden<br/>horograms/recurrent sequences. The last criterion changes things a<br/>bit, and implies the following analogy: golden horograms:metastable<br/>intervals::what we want:maxima of HE.</p><p>A good function which fits these criteria, taken from one of Gene&apos;s<br/>suggestions from a while ago, is to look at Minkowski&apos;s question mark<br/>function ?(x).

The problem with this is if you go down another layer to a set of 64 , one has to renumber them all to preserve their order.</p><p> If there are others interested in an alternative arrange along side the one that exist, i would be up for making that available.

He although surely understood what area it would have been in. It is too easy to confuse  some of them. I would imagine that Hanson helped with  the math formula found in Meruthree.

In other words, it&apos;s now<br/>become more important to avoid really simple rationals, so it doesn&apos;t<br/>matter as much if we develop a few ambiguous intervals of lesser<br/>importance down the road. Keep in mind these statements still apply to<br/>entire rank-2 tunings in general, though, and not any particular MOS.</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/questconvs=8.png">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/questconvs=8.png</a></p><p>Minima are</p><p>459.24 - father<br/>500.16 - meantone<br/>328.32 - orgone<br/>355.44 - beatles<br/>524.88 - mavila<br/>261.72 - superpelog<br/>217.32 - machine<br/>184.08 - glacial<br/>162.24 - porcupine</p><p>Here&apos;s a superfine curve at s=1 cents.
