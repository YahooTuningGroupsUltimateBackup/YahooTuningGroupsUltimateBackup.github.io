No, I just sat on my keyboard...</p><p>I wanted to thank both Paul Erlich and Kraig Grady for their interesting<br/>scales which, comforting to me, included 12 notes per octave (whew!)</p><p>I&apos;m assuming, Paul that the original 22 note scale that you are<br/>extracting your 12-note scale from is the following:</p><p> 0:          1/1               0.000<br/> 1:         50.250 cents      50.250<br/> 2:        105.750 cents     105.750<br/> 3:        161.250 cents     161.250<br/> 4:        211.500 cents     211.500<br/> 5:        272.250 cents     272.250<br/> 6:        322.500 cents     322.500<br/> 7:        383.250 cents     383.250<br/> 8:        428.250 cents     428.250<br/> 9:        494.250 cents     494.250<br/>10:        539.250 cents     539.250<br/>11:        594.750 cents     594.750<br/>12:        650.250 cents     650.250<br/>13:        705.750 cents     705.750<br/>14:        761.250 cents     761.250<br/>15:        816.750 cents     816.750<br/>16:        872.250 cents     872.250<br/>17:        917.250 cents     917.250<br/>18:        983.250 cents     983.250<br/>19:       1028.250 cents    1028.250<br/>20:       1089.000 cents    1089.000<br/>21:       1139.250 cents    1139.250<br/>22:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>Please correct me if I&apos;m wrong.

My bad, as JM says...</p><p>Now this compares very nicely with Kraig Grady&apos;s, &quot;Centaur&quot; scale, which<br/>I tuned up.</p><p>Hey, you know these two scales are really fairly close to our<br/>traditional 12-tET... at least the way my ears are on at the moment...<br/>(Maybe wrong) And if I&apos;m doing everything right.  Well, I mean, of<br/>course they are in 7-limit just... but closer than some of the other<br/>scales I have been &quot;messing&quot; with...</p><p>As I mentioned, there is something really comforting about 12 notes per<br/>octave and repeating octaves at 12... particularly among the<br/>&quot;keyboard-centric&quot; set, in which I, for better or worse, number...  It<br/>also makes it easier to transcribe such pieces for traditional<br/>instruments, if one cares to do that.  (Not, obviously, for everybody).</p><p>HOWEVER, at the moment I am fixated on the following... a scale which<br/>has 12 notes per octave but which is constructed of hexanys!  I guess<br/>these would be &quot;stellated hexanies,&quot; yes??</p><p>The scale is in Scala, and it is called &quot;hexanys.scl.&quot;  It is as<br/>follows:</p><p>Hexanys 1 3 5 7 9<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         35/32            155.140 septimal neutral second<br/>  2:          9/8             203.910 major whole tone<br/>  3:          5/4             386.314 major third<br/>  4:         21/16            470.781 narrow fourth<br/>  5:         45/32            590.224 tritone<br/>  6:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/>  7:        105/64            857.095 septimal neutral sixth<br/>  8:         27/16            905.865 Pythagorean major sixth<br/>  9:          7/4             968.826 harmonic seventh<br/> 10:         15/8            1088.269 classic major seventh<br/> 11:         63/32           1172.736 octave - septimal comma<br/> 12:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>It seems there are MANY interesting things about this scale.  For one<br/>thing, there are FIVE hexanys contained within it!</p><p>John Chalmers showed me this... I was going to make you believe I<br/>figured it out for myself, but &quot;chickened out&quot; :-)</p><p>Hexany <a href="http://1.3.5.7">1.3.5.7</a>:  32/35 5/4 21/16 3/2 7/4 15/8</p><p>Hexany <a href="http://1.3.5.9">1.3.5.9</a>:  9/8 5/4 45/32 3/2 27/16 15/8</p><p>Hexany <a href="http://1.3.7.9">1.3.7.9</a>:  9/8 21/16 3/2 27/16 7/4 63/32</p><p>Hexany <a href="http://1.5.7.9">1.5.7.9</a>:  35/32 9/8 5/4 45/32 7/4 63/32</p><p>Hexany <a href="http://3.5.7.9">3.5.7.9</a>:  35/32 21/16 45/32 27/16 15/8 63/32</p><p>Whoopie!</p><p>This means, of course, that the pre-compositional composer can have a<br/>&quot;field day...&quot; One can begin with a certain hexany and then &quot;mutate&quot; it<br/>to another near form... one can &quot;transpose&quot; by LINKED common-notes<br/>between hexanys, etc.</p><p>Or, one could just listen to the sounds... not entirely prohibited, but<br/>for some, perhaps unadvisable.</p><p>A funny property of this scale for the &quot;keyboard fixated&quot; is the fact<br/>that our keyboard &quot;major chord&quot; C-E-G-C comes out as the subdominant<br/>(using a &quot;narrow fourth&quot; and a &quot;septimal neutral sixth&quot;) and the &quot;major<br/>triad&quot; of the root can be easily made by C-Eb-Gb-C (a just major third<br/>and perfect fifth!)... so there can be a kind of &quot;plagal cadence&quot; action<br/>going on... although I doubt seriously I would use the scale like<br/>that...</p><p>It also doesn&apos;t seem that hard to &quot;transcribe&quot; to traditional 12-tET<br/>staff notation, using quartertones and cents deviation... but I know<br/>there are people on this list who feel this is very &quot;naughty, naughty!&quot;</p><p>____________ ______ ___ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=10746 href="#10746">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2000 6:57:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Joseph Pehrson &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; OUCH!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m assuming, Paul that the original 22 note scale that you are<br/>&gt; extracting your 12-note scale from is the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  0:          1/1               0.000<br/>&gt;  1:         50.250 cents      50.250<br/>&gt;  2:        105.750 cents     105.750<br/>&gt;  3:        161.250 cents     161.250<br/>&gt;  4:        211.500 cents     211.500<br/>&gt;  5:        272.250 cents     272.250<br/>&gt;  6:        322.500 cents     322.500<br/>&gt;  7:        383.250 cents     383.250<br/>&gt;  8:        428.250 cents     428.250<br/>&gt;  9:        494.250 cents     494.250<br/>&gt; 10:        539.250 cents     539.250<br/>&gt; 11:        594.750 cents     594.750<br/>&gt; 12:        650.250 cents     650.250<br/>&gt; 13:        705.750 cents     705.750<br/>&gt; 14:        761.250 cents     761.250<br/>&gt; 15:        816.750 cents     816.750<br/>&gt; 16:        872.250 cents     872.250<br/>&gt; 17:        917.250 cents     917.250<br/>&gt; 18:        983.250 cents     983.250<br/>&gt; 19:       1028.250 cents    1028.250<br/>&gt; 20:       1089.000 cents    1089.000<br/>&gt; 21:       1139.250 cents    1139.250<br/>&gt; 22:          2/1            1200.000 octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please correct me if I&apos;m wrong.

Then try the mirror versions of those chords (i.e., the way<br/>they would appear in a mirror placed next to your keyboard). What is<br/>your reaction? Do you like them better than in 12-tET? Try the other<br/>tetrads -- do some sound more dissonant to you?
