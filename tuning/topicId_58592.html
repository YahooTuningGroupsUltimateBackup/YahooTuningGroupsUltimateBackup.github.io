The above link is an article from<br/>Dec 2000 profiling composer James Newton Howard, and I believe it<br/>gives a lot of insight into how one needs to shape electronic tools to<br/>reflect humanistic playing styles. I&apos;m not saying his way is the only<br/>way, but it certainly is an illustrative look at someone who brings<br/>this off quite well.</p><p>Since you asked about equipment, note his list at the end of the<br/>article. To see just how egregious this can get, note the number in<br/>parenthesis after his mention of the Roland S-760 Sampler - (28). Yes,<br/>indeed, at this time he had 28 of those suckers in his rack!</p><p>Unfortunately, the two example files aren&apos;t online, but I may have<br/>them on one of my older machines archived. If you are interested, I&apos;ll<br/>look for them...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
