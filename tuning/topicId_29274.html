Have you read the<br/>&gt; back issues of<br/>&gt; Xenharmonicon? There are some incredibly detailed articles on layouts for<br/>&gt; instruments, mainly by<br/>&gt; Erv Wilson.

Or at least, someone with good carpentry type skills could<br/>(in my case I&apos;d prob. ask one of my relatives for help, as he is a carpenter).</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m still not sure about this. I&apos;m coming round to the opinion, through<br/>&gt; listening and comparing,<br/>&gt; that 2 - 3 cents of Just is pretty much Just, given the inharmonicity of<br/>&gt; strings in particular. I<br/>&gt; intend to try a small group of instruments, including metal tubes, tuned to<br/>&gt; &apos;Blackjack&apos;. As with<br/>&gt; 22 tet I like to work with one tuning for a reasonable length of time. Then<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll make a set of<br/>&gt; Eikosany tubes and work with that. After all that I might be qualified to<br/>&gt; comment on the effects<br/>&gt; of tempering.</p><p>Glad you have the idea of keeping up the pure just temperaments too.<br/>I try to keep both strands active too, playing both ets and just scales.</p><p>I&apos;ve been finding while playing in various temperaments that one seems to be<br/>affected by quite subtle distinctions, even if one can&apos;t actually hear them<br/>easily when listening to it played back. As someone posted a while back<br/>about Arabic music, the players go by the taste. Or in Western literature,<br/>the colour. Maybe we need to relearn the ability to listen to that kind<br/>of aspect of a tuning?</p><p>This is kind of a bit shy of analysis as if one tries hard to hear the<br/>pitchs and intervals, one forgets the gentler approach of hearing the feeling of<br/>the temperament. It kind of would make more sense to write a little poem after<br/>listening to the temperament, or something, and see if the language and metaphors<br/>used depended on the temperament.</p><p>&gt; Well, I suppose the sound comes first and I have to say that I liked Joseph&apos;s<br/>&gt; piece and I have a<br/>&gt; batch of ideas from tinkering with &apos;Blackjack&apos; on my synth. It all depends on<br/>&gt; whether I can get<br/>&gt; the sounds into my head and start thinking and creating with that scale. Same<br/>&gt; old problem.</p><p>Well, sounds like a good basis for using it to me, for what its worth,...</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=29298 href="#29298">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2001 12:06:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I try to keep both strands active too, playing both ets and just<br/>scales.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget the Middle Path!</p></div><h3><a id=29315 href="#29315">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2001 2:16:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Alison,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some sort of metallophone or marimba would fit this layout.

Both<br/>seem easy to find in the UK. The latter has some fine thumb piano designs to address your next<br/>point. The first has a &apos;Rumba Box&apos; design, a type of very large mbira. I&apos;m building two, one is<br/>ready to tune. I&apos;ve found that the larger and more massive the prongs or &apos;keys&apos;, the easier they<br/>will be to tune. And I need a strong bass section to blend with the tubulong.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just today I&apos;ve been musing about whether one could make a compact hexany type<br/>&gt; instrument modelled after the African kalimba or thumb piano?

Or at least, someone with good carpentry type skills could<br/>&gt; (in my case I&apos;d prob. ask one of my relatives for help, as he is a carpenter).</p><p>I&apos;ve found the carpentry very satisfying and meditative. Most of it revolvers around making boxes.<br/>I started with slit drums which I&apos;ve tuned roughly to 3:2, 4:3 and both types of thirds. With<br/>little or no skills you soon learn and after a few months of learning what the tools could do I<br/>found that I could work fast and effectively.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been finding while playing in various temperaments that one seems to be<br/>&gt; affected by quite subtle distinctions, even if one can&apos;t actually hear them<br/>&gt; easily when listening to it played back.

It kind of would make more sense to write a little poem after<br/>&gt; listening to the temperament, or something, and see if the language and metaphors<br/>&gt; used depended on the temperament.</p><p>This is very beautiful. First impressions and improvisations are very important. You have to<br/>savour the essence of a temperament while it is fresh. I&apos;m ignoring 22 for a short while - it<br/>started sounding quite ordinary because I had spent so much time with it. Nonetheless I feel I<br/>have captured something of its essence. I find it hard to write anything harsh or edgy in 22. Who<br/>knows what Blackjack will reveal? Here&apos;s one initial finding. I map out &apos;Blackjack&apos; on a the white<br/>and black notes of a standard keyboard. Strictly by ear and paying no attention to tone names<br/>apart from my middle C I play my C tonic and find the best 3/2.Then the best 5/4. I arpeggiate<br/>with these tones. Happy with this I sharpen my tonic one step and I find that the triad is still<br/>acceptable as a major triad. Obviously, I&apos;ll need to double check everything and look at the<br/>resolution of my synth and try this with a variety of timbres, but this type of discovery could<br/>prove fruitful for both tonal and modal modulation.</p><p>Good Luck and keep the compositions flowing.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div>
