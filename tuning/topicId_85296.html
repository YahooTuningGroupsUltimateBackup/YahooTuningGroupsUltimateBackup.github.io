Can it emulate all<br/>imaginable musical scales?&lt;*********<br/>     Personal opinion, this &quot;goal&quot; can also be a disadvantage.</p><p>Any scale system that could &quot;emulate all musical scales&quot; would likely limit itself making new styles of scales by doing so.<br/>    Easy example: a system that emulates 12-TET, 24-TET, and 22-TET very well would most likely be limited to TET style scales...in the same way if you build a car for drag racing and tractor pulling (straight line abilities) its cornering ability would likely be limited.<br/>   Another problem; emulating all musical tunings and scale would include &quot;odd&quot; scales like pelog, Wilson&apos;s MOS scales, Hyper-Mos scale, Sethares&apos; &quot;derived from timbre&quot; scales, Maqams, and more in addition to TET tunings...even with a so called &quot;all flexible&quot; tuning system (IE Lucy Tuning or MOS) I doubt all of the systems could be covered.<br/>   Lastly the ability to &quot;emulate all scales&quot; is, so far as I know, a &quot;staple&quot; ability/goal of Lucy Tuning (it can indeed emulate many different types of scales well)...but I don&apos;t see why scale systems should aim toward that goal (in reality, many other leading systems don&apos;t and, IMVHO, succeed in many ways because they don&apos;t).</p><p>   A side note; I&apos;m working on a 22TET piece...and am really starting to like working with 22-TET as it seems to sound different enough from Western scale systems (with strong and smooth/decently consonance 8-9 note scales possible and lots of extra tonal freedom) yet still harmonic enough to give the illusion you are hitting harmonics almost dead-on.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Mario Pizarro &lt;piagui@...&gt;<br/>To: tuning yahoogroups &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sun, November 22, 2009 2:06:20 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] IMO-2</p><p>Dear friends,</p><p>Charles Lucy has added four<br/>questions/doubts to what Michael stated regarding my post (IMO) sent last 11/20.</p><p>Charles&apos;questions and my answers follow:</p><p>&lt;********3. Can this tuning<br/>system infinitely modulate and &lt;transpose?** ****</p><p>Since 12<br/>ET is able to modulate and transpose (I am not sure about the meaning of<br/>&quot;modulate&quot; and &quot;transpose&quot;) since this scale was derived from a simple<br/>arithmetical operation, I suppose that JUSTHARM scale, the name of the three new<br/>scales, can also do it. The term<br/>&quot;infinitely&quot; could have been excluded in the question..</p><p>&lt;********4. Can it emulate all<br/>imaginable musical scales?&lt;*********</p><p>Emulation<br/>is not a respectable future for a scale that still is being evaluated and<br/>almost nobody knows its features. &quot;Emulation&quot;, &quot;All imaginable musical scales&quot;<br/>!!,  a dose of undefined terms begins to appear:<br/>I suspect that I didn&apos;t pray to St. Charles.</p><p>&lt;********5. Can it produce and<br/>control both consonance and &lt;dissonance?* *****</p><p>No one scale controls consonance<br/>and dissonance. If we tune a piano to a<br/>PERFECT SCALE, neither Mephistopheles would impede<br/>that the player plays what we call dissonant chords 24 hours a<br/>day, actually they do not deserve to be called that way. The dissonant<br/>effect that you are probably referring to, precisely comes from the particular<br/>amplitude distribution of harmonic components presented by the piano<br/>itself. The JUSTHARM scale consonance production is granted<br/>since its foundations rely on K and P semitone factors and M, J commas.</p><p>&lt;********6. Are the harmonic &quot;rules&quot; it<br/>uses &quot;practical&quot; and easily understood? &lt;*******</p><p>IMO harmonic<br/>rules should not exist. Physics showed that harmonic parameters obey to<br/>physical characteristics of the instrument which have no relation with music but<br/>they improve its expression. If you replace the piano strings or the hammers,<br/>you will notice that harmonic components or overtones have changed; each<br/>new partial percentage, or most of them, varied despite the scale is the<br/>same.</p><p>I spent<br/>some time trying to understand what makes the difference between a<br/>practical and a non-practical harmonic rules. Fourier integral and Fourier<br/>analysis explain all about it.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario<br/>Pizarro</p><p>Lima, November 22,<br/>2009<br/>piagui@ec-red. com</p><p>On 21 Nov 2009, at 01:35, Michael wrote:</p></div>
