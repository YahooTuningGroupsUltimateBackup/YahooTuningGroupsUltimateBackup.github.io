We know that the ancient<br/>Greeks used structured<br/>&gt;intervals as small as a quarter-tone, so do many folk musics from<br/>around the world and<br/>&gt;Indian classical music.&quot;</p><p>The original is here:</p><p><a href="http://www.tonysalinas.com/Flier-UKM2%5B1%5D.pdf">http://www.tonysalinas.com/Flier-UKM2%5B1%5D.pdf</a></p><p>Is this Just and ET snobbery?<br/>Justification for dissonance?<br/>Should Johnny Reinhard&rsquo;s Manhattan based American Festival of<br/>Microtonal Music, and this tuning list now ban discussion of all<br/>meantone tunings?<br/>Should Johnny rename his excellent organisation?<br/>How does this effect Graham Breed and others who have used the term?</p><p>This creates a contradiction with the definition at:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music</a></p><p>which specifically excludes 24edo.</p><p>Do I smell an impending wiki war?;-)</p><p>Charles Lucy <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a></p><p>-----  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -----</p><p>For information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world):<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>Skype user = lucytune</p></div><h3><a id=70175 href="#70175">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2007 3:18:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; This creates a contradiction with the definition at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which specifically excludes 24edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do I smell an impending wiki war?;-)</p><p>The wiki page is full of badly written nonsense, as far as I can see.</p><p>For example the reference to Kuhnau composing a piece &apos;in meantone&apos;<br/>&apos;in the 1730&apos;s&apos;. For one thing, Kuhnau died in the mid-1720&apos;s ;  for<br/>another, no-one knows what tuning system he used or wanted or would<br/>have expected for a given piece. All we know is what notes he wrote.<br/>(Which include an awful lot of Ab major chords in rather unremarkable<br/>musical contexts.)</p><p>And the usual vague hand-waving about the Hurrian hymn...</p><p>The wikipedia &apos;definition&apos; of anything that doesn&apos;t include 12-et<br/>breaks down as soon as we consider a piano which is almost but not<br/>quite equal-tempered. Audibly almost identical to 12-et, with<br/>virtually identical musical possibilities, but Wiki tells us it&apos;s<br/>microtonal.</p><p>And the exclusion of 24-et (also, by implication, 72-et) is nonsensical.</p><p>Let me put forward another one:</p><p>Microtonal music is music that depends on differences of pitch, or<br/>differences between intervals, smaller than a semitone.</p><p>This includes anything you would expect (for example JI depends on the<br/>distinction between a major and a minor tone; chromatic progressions<br/>in meantone depend on the distinction between a diatonic and chromatic<br/>semitone; etc.) - but excludes the slightly-mistuned piano, since no<br/>musical aspect of what you can do with it depends on anything smaller<br/>than a semitone.</p><p>It also excludes, say, Gregorian chant, which I think is reasonable,<br/>since the precise tuning properties of diatonic monophonic chanting<br/>are irrelevant to its musical effect.</p><p>It is of course somewhat vague and subjective: but then so is the<br/>whole business of composing and performing music. To paraphrase<br/>Einstein, one should be as precise and objective as possible, but not<br/>more.</p><p>Comments ?</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=70179 href="#70179">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2007 5:59:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Comments ?</p><p>I think it was better before it got improved so much.</p></div><h3><a id=70183 href="#70183">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2007 2:28:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt; Let me put forward another one:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Microtonal music is music that depends on differences of pitch, or<br/>&gt; differences between intervals, smaller than a semitone.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I disagree with this definition, because I think microtonal music is based<br/>too on the distinction of pitches by intervals between the tone and the<br/>semitone.</p><p>That is why Maqam Music is microtonal; not because it uses steps smaller<br/>than a semitone, but characteristic ones between that and the whole tone.</p><p>SNIP</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=70188 href="#70188">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2007 9:58:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SNIP<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let me put forward another one:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Microtonal music is music that depends on differences of pitch, or<br/>&gt; &gt; differences between intervals, smaller than a semitone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree with this definition, because I think microtonal music is<br/>based<br/>&gt; too on the distinction of pitches by intervals between the tone and the<br/>&gt; semitone.</p><p>The *difference* between such intervals and a tone is smaller than a<br/>semitone ; therefore the definition still applies, if Maquam uses<br/>semitone and tone steps too.</p><p>However I did soon think of a possible true exception: music with<br/>equally spaced intervals all larger than a semitone - 8-et etc.</p><p>I think a nice name for this would be macrotonality!!</p><p>GWS:<br/>&gt; it was better before it got improved so much</p><p>Funny, but I&apos;m not sure what that refers to.

It is clear to me that Schoenberg<br/>grappled for some time with the idea of using microtones,<br/>only to finally decide against them because it become<br/>obvious to him that, as his style changed and his audiences<br/>become more and more polarized regarding his new style<br/>either for (his small cult following) or against (the vast<br/>majority of potential listeners), he was already in<br/>jeopardy of losing his ability to make any kind of a living<br/>as a composer, and it didn&apos;t make any sense to further<br/>reduce his odds by composing his music for ensembles of<br/>microtonal instruments which didn&apos;t exist. So his decision<br/>to stick with 12-edo was, to him, truly one of survival,<br/>and it was based more on the standardization of instruments<br/>that had been produced since the dawn of the industrial age,<br/>than on anything else.</p><p>So with that explanation given, i go along with &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>as referring to any music which utilizes tunings different<br/>from 12-edo, even if the difference is not very great.</p><p>I&apos;ll agree that on etymological grounds the word &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>is probably not the best suited for this usage, but it&apos;s<br/>pretty well entrenched by now.
