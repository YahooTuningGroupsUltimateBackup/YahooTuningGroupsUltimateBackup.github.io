I doubt that the integration of the<br/>&gt;&gt; signal performed by the cochlea and the central nervous system exceeds by<br/>&gt;&gt; much one seconds, so I doubt that we can, by ear, make the difference for<br/>&gt;&gt; less than a few cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i made this argument a few months ago here -- search the archives<br/>&gt; for &apos;classical uncertainty principle&apos;. the argument was not at all<br/>&gt; well received here, and one of the counteraguments involved the<br/>&gt; (true) fact that the human auditory system uses mechanisms other than<br/>&gt; position on the cochlea to make frequency determinations.<br/>&gt; nevertheless, i agree that it is an important argument.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that the ear likely hears harmonic combinations of<br/>pitches differently than it hears single frequencies. Consider that those<br/>many of us without pitch recognition seem to get by very well using our<br/>sense of relative pitch, whether or not we recognize &quot;frequencies.&quot;</p><p>In my experience, the discrimination of harmonic relationships is far more<br/>sensitive than simple pitch discrimination. I think I demonstrated that in<br/>reporting my response to the single-pitch jerries in one of my recent posts.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
