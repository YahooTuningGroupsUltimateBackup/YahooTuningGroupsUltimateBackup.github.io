(As to the equally needless bashing of list<br/>members, I&apos;m trying to ignore that.)</p><p>When Sch&ouml;nberg talked about the &quot;emancipation of the dissonance&quot;, he<br/>was in fact trying to treat dissonances and consonances equal.<br/>Refuting Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s purpose by pointing out the dissonance of<br/>3/4-tones and the consonance of near-thirds is quite beside the<br/>point. And what&apos;s wrong with referring to current musical or even<br/>physical theory? However faulty it was, it had the value of being a<br/>starting point for Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s explorations. And every theory, even<br/>Helmhotz&apos;s, is a legitimate theory if it can serve as a starting<br/>point for its revision.</p><p>Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s main instrument was the cello, and it was an easy thing<br/>for him to make the overtones heard. The tuning used in the world<br/>around him is another matter. If he chose to accept it, why blame<br/>him? If he ever played in a string quartet (and he did), it was<br/>clear to him that the thirds already do not conform to 12-equal. If<br/>he does<br/>not want to treat dissonances as dissonances, the current theory<br/>tells him to incorporate them into some harmonic series and  he will<br/>get the flat third and seventh degrees as the seventh harmonic of<br/>the<br/>fourth and first, the tritone as the eleventh, the minor third as<br/>the thirteenth... He does this to fill up the holes, the unusable<br/>notes in a key in order to use them all freely. What&apos;s wrong with<br/>this?</p><p>It&apos;s another thing to criticise him for not educating the listeners<br/>to the true harmonics before giving them overtones in a tempered<br/>version (going up, as Sch&ouml;nberg does, to the 13th harmonic, there<br/>should be six different intonations for every 12tET step - and<br/>that&apos;s only counting direct relations).</p><p>It&apos;s yet another thing to take the step towards treating all tones<br/>and all intervals equally and revert to an essentially melodic<br/>organisation in his compositions, as he eventually did. Again, it is<br/>(I think) still an open question if thinking or talking about 13<br/>harmonics is a necessary preliminay for this, but if he did think of<br/>harmonic relations in his &quot;free atonal&quot; music, this would be the<br/>consequence of acknowledging the many confalted notes.</p><p>But all this should not have any bearing on stylistic value<br/>judgements which are purely personal and should be treated as such.<br/>Compare Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s music or painting to the music or painting of<br/>his contemporaries (in Germany/Austria). Is it really the technique<br/>that turns you off? Is it really Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s dilettant ineptitude?<br/>Or could it be that you don&apos;t like the expressive content?</p><p>From central Europe, which is at least as far removed from the<br/>centers of civilisation as Boston, Mass.,</p><p>Klaus Schmirler</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; FROM: mclaren<br/>&gt; TO: new practical microtonal list<br/>&gt; SUBJECT: Monzo&apos;s dreary effort to defend the indefensible<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      In Message 16 of Digest 32, Joe Monzo made a fool of himself by<br/>&gt; making deliberate statements which are not true.
