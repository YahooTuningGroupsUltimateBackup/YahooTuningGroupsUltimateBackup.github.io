What does this paper say?</p><p>Johnny: It&apos;s a short paper on the geometry of equal  temperament.  Marpurg<br/>had been publishing something of a newsletter, which  the East Germans compiled<br/>into a book that I have.  In it, Marpurg  indicates the true author as Moses<br/>Mendelssohn.  Most likely, Moses was  studying some of the musical arts with<br/>Kirnberger, as many of his descendents  did.</p><p>&gt; Paul: Wow!!! So Kirnberger, all by his little old  self, &quot;discovers&quot;<br/>the<br/>&gt; schisma in 1766, and then further &quot;discovers&quot;  that it is equal to<br/>1/12<br/>&gt; of a P comma! Oooo! Cutting edge stuff  indeed!</p><p>Gene: I would call the Kirberger atom cutting edge, yes. Who  before 1766<br/>remarked that twelve times the difference between a Didymus and  a<br/>Pythagorean comma was almost exactly a Pythagorean comma?</p><p>Johnny:  Thank you for a timely  comment.</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div>
