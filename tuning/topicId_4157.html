Inordinary polyrhythmic<br/>terms we speak of 5 in the space of 4, or 7 in the space of 6. In<br/>Xenochrony we deal with larger units of time; a complete solo at one<br/>metronomic rate in the space of a track at another ... sort of like<br/>Monday and Tuesday crammed into the space of Wednesday.&quot;</p><p>Yeah! Take out the &apos;random&apos; in &quot;various tracks from unrelated sources<br/>are randomly synchronized with each other,&quot; and this is a technique I<br/>use all the time in my music. I&apos;ve also found that &apos;thinking&apos; or<br/>hearing in this way (&quot;with rhythmic relationships unachievable by<br/>other means&quot;) has over the years steadily infiltrated my real-time<br/>playing and &apos;thinking...&apos; which I also believe in turn, had certain<br/>liberating ramifications on my approach towards (and conceptions of)<br/>intonation and tunings.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
