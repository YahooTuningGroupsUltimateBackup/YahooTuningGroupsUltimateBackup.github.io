Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2000 4:38:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Banaphshu wrote,</p><p>&gt;To my ear, these are extremely consonant chords, much more than your<br/>western practice numerals would make you think.</p><p>I would say that 7:9:11 and similar chords have some degree of<br/>_concordance_, and very much like styles of music (e.g., Partch) that<br/>incorporate them; however, I would say that they would not be accepted where<br/>augmented triads are written in a score of Gesualdo, Gluck, or Grieg.</p><p>&gt;. I also don&apos;t understand your &quot;research&quot; concerning the subharmonic chords<br/>for I have always heard them as consonant.</p><p>OK . . . I hear them as consonant too, but only to the extent that the<br/>individual intervals are consonant . . . have you tried the examples that<br/>Daniel Wolf posted comparing the 4:5:6:7:9 and 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 chords?<br/>These chords contain exactly the same intervals, but with a timbre rich<br/>enough in harmonic partials, say a sustained trumpet sound, the subharmonic<br/>chord sounds more discordant (in my opinion, because of that &quot;car horn&quot; 7:9)<br/>than the harmonic chord -- in fact Joseph perceived the subharmonic chord<br/>followed by the harmonic chord as a powerful resolution.</p><p>I suspect we may be basing our judgments on vastly different timbres -- in<br/>your case, metallophones or their wooden cousins perhaps?</p><p>&gt;harmonically based chords many times just blend into a timbre.</p><p>Exactly. With metallophones and other types of instruments that are<br/>primarily a sine wave with weak, possibly inharmonic, overtones, and maybe<br/>some noise, a justly tuned otonal chord will blend into the sensation of a<br/>single note, even if the fundamental of that note is physically absent. With<br/>more complex timbres playing a &quot;harmonically based&quot; (otonal) chord, this<br/>fundamental sensation will be very strong and provide a sense of order that<br/>overwhelms the dissonance arising from any individual intervals. Play the<br/>mirror-image of that chord (the &quot;subharmonic&quot; or utonal version), and any<br/>dissonant intervals will noticeably spoil the consonance of the chord as a<br/>whole.</p><p>&gt;The problem must be with my ears as it is hard to imagine that science<br/>could be mistaken.</p><p>I make references to &quot;science&quot; where I seek explanations for what I hear but<br/>what I hear always comes first. My opinions on this matter are based on<br/>extensive listening first, and then trying to understand what I hear in<br/>terms of what is understood about the ear and brain -- never the other way<br/>around.</p><p>Got to go now -- I think the best way to resolve these kinds of issues is<br/>with listening experiments . . . if we make sure we are listening to the<br/>exact same sounds, and everyone else can hear them too, then everyone can<br/>decide on the possible merits of various points on the basis of what their<br/>own ears tell them . . .</p></div>
