I need to add the<br/>following:-</p><p>[1]  Gamaka-s formed the main vehicle of aesthetical expression for<br/>dhrupad singing.  Dhrupad singing has become much less current these<br/>days. Khayal singing, on the other hand, employs gamaka-s optionally<br/>to other forms of embellishment.</p><p>[2]  Interestingly, Sharngsdeva, in his &apos;sangitaratnakara&apos;, is the<br/>first to treat gamaka-s exclusively.  Bharata Muni has included<br/>gamaka-s as a part of alankara-s.</p><p>Haresh.</p></div>
