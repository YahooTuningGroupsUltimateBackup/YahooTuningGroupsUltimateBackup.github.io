The<br/>first quarter of each example has all of the sines phase-locked. The<br/>next three have the phases of each sine staggered so that they are all<br/>out of phase with one another, but in different ways. If this doesn&apos;t<br/>make sense, it will when you see the images. Finally, I play the first<br/>example again at the end for comparison.</p><p>Your task is to tell me if you think that the periodicity buzz is<br/>changing between the four sections of the audio.</p><p>Sound: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567buzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567buzz.wav</a><br/>Gammatone: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567buzz.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567buzz.png</a></p><p>Sound: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/78910buzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/78910buzz.wav</a><br/>Gammatone: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/78910buzz.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/78910buzz.png</a></p><p>Sound: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/16171819buzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/16171819buzz.wav</a><br/>Gammatone: <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/16171819buzz.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/16171819buzz.png</a></p><p>I have also created &quot;alternate&quot; versions of the 5:6:7 and 7:8:9:10<br/>examples, but I&apos;m not going to tell you just how alternate - yet.<br/>Suffice to say they have to be at least kind of alternate, or else I<br/>wouldn&apos;t have said they&apos;re alternate.

Jesus, they&apos;re all like 8 seconds long, and there&apos;s<br/>only 8 of them. This takes what, 64 seconds of your time? I spent like<br/>2 hours making all of this. Yes, I am bitter.</p><p>OK, anyways, here&apos;s my results, as well as the answer to the mystery chords:</p><p>-=-PERIODICITY BUZZ RESULTS-=-<br/>Each chord has 4 different choices of phase shift. Of those choices, I<br/>heard the first choice (phases all aligned) as having by far the most<br/>obvious periodicity buzz for ALL the chords played, every time. Of the<br/>remaining 3, I usually heard the second or third as having much less<br/>periodicity buzz than the others; usually the second was the least.</p><p>Periodicity buzz was not constant for all the examples - I heard more<br/>buzz when the intervals were closer together. I also sometimes heard<br/>weird pitch shifting effects taking place for different phase shifts,<br/>especially when the intervals were really close together.</p><p>-=-ALTERNATE EXAMPLES-=-<br/>The alternate examples are non-periodic, linearly stretched or<br/>compressed versions of the chord they&apos;re representing. In each case,<br/>the outer dyad has been changed to sqrt(2), and the intervals have<br/>been uniformly stretched with respect to LINEAR frequency (not cents)<br/>to even out the difference.The alternate 5:6:7 one is actually<br/>1:sqrt(2)/2-1/2:sqrt(2). The alternate 7:8:9:10 one is the same thing<br/>- the 7:10 has been compressed to be sqrt(2). So this chord is<br/>1:sqrt(2)/3-2/3:2*sqrt(2)/3-1/3:sqrt(2). Note the pattern here - every<br/>interval is separated from its nearest neighbor by a constant<br/>frequency difference.</p><p>Note that there is still periodicity buzz, and so the buzz is<br/>apparently not &quot;periodicity&quot; buzz at all.</p><p>And note also that the VF mechanism still manages to do its job. I<br/>also chose these examples to demonstrate a side point about the VF<br/>mechanism: when people complain about sqrt(2) being a really crappy<br/>approximation for 7/5 and 10/7, they should note that it might not be<br/>too bad - as long as all of the other intervals in a sonority like<br/>7:8:9:10 are compressed linearly and evenly. The same applies even for<br/>the 5-equal fifth, as we&apos;ll see. This also suggests a new method of<br/>error optimization that I&apos;d like to explore, but later.</p><p>-=-MYSTERY EXAMPLES-=-<br/>The first example has the outer dyad as phi, and creates a pentad with<br/>a constant frequency difference between the notes. So you have<br/>1:phi/5-4/5:2*phi/5-3/5:3*phi/5-2/5:4*phi/5-1/5:phi. This is one of<br/>the least periodic signals ever, but I still hear &quot;periodicity&quot; buzz,<br/>and it&apos;s still phase-dependent. You can see a plot of the waveform<br/>here:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/phiwaveform.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/phiwaveform.png</a></p><p>Note that when the phase is constant, the uniform group delay causes<br/>huge &quot;spikes&quot; in the waveform. The spikes are recurring, but the<br/>signal isn&apos;t actually periodic. So it&apos;s not periodicity buzz at all.<br/>We&apos;ll come back to this later for an explanation. The point is that<br/>periodicity buzz doesn&apos;t actually have to do with periodicity, but the<br/>frequency differences between adjacent notes; I have termed this<br/>property of a chord &quot;linear evenness,&quot; because difference &quot;tones&quot;<br/>aren&apos;t really involved here.</p><p>The other two mystery examples were all linearly-even as well:<br/>mystery2buzz was a linearly-even tetrad in which the outer dyad was<br/>sqrt(phi), and mystery3buzz was a tetrad in which the outer dyad was<br/>1000 cents. I did this in response to Gene&apos;s question in this thread:<br/><a href="http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/24727">http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/24727</a></p><p>The last one is notable because this is basically a stretched 4:5:6:7;<br/>the cents values are 0-400.9-726.25-1000. 30-equal approximates this<br/>triad really well.</p><p>-=-PSYCHOACOUSTIC EXPLANATION-=-</p><p>There are a lot of ways to explain this from a signal processing<br/>standpoint, most involving the mixed time-frequency response of the<br/>cochlea due to nonuniform damping. However, this same concept is<br/>something most of us already intuitively understand, and it has to do<br/>with the varying width of the auditory filter, and hence the critical<br/>band, along the frequency spectrum. Let&apos;s look at the stretched<br/>4:5:6:7 example again (the phi one):</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/stretched4567labeled.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/stretched4567labeled.png</a></p><p>The approximate frequencies at which 4, 5, 6, and 7 actually occur are<br/>labeled. Note that the buzzing is taking place BETWEEN these<br/>frequencies - not at them. So what&apos;s going on here?</p><p>Let&apos;s look at the stretched 6:7 dyad, since that&apos;s the smallest, and<br/>hence has the most buzz. The frequencies of the stretched 6:7 are 397<br/>and 465 Hz, which is a difference of 68 Hz. Here are the ERB&apos;s at 397<br/>Hz and 465 Hz:</p><p>397 Hz ERB = 24.7*(4.37*0.397 + 1) = 67.55 Hz = 33.78 Hz in either direction<br/>465 Hz ERB = 24.7*(4.37*0.465 + 1) = 74.89 Hz = 37.45 Hz in either direction</p><p>The problems with ERB&apos;s aside, this is clearly not wide enough for the<br/>465 Hz to fall into 397 Hz&apos;s auditory filter, or vice versa. So what<br/>IS going on?</p><p>A clue can be found by going back to the gammatone plot for 4:5:6:7 -<br/>note that there is a minimum of AM at the actual frequencies that are<br/>being played, but lots of AM between the frequencies between them.<br/>This suggests that while 465 is out of 397 Hz&apos;s critical band, and<br/>while 397 is out of 465 Hz&apos;s critical band, both fall within<br/>(465+397)/2 = 431 Hz&apos;s critical band. Let&apos;s work out the ERB here:</p><p>431 Hz ERB = 24.7*(4.37*0.431 + 1) = 71.222 Hz = 35.61 Hz in either direction<br/>431 Hz max ERB cutoff: 431 Hz + 35.61 Hz = 466.61 Hz<br/>431 Hz min ERB cutoff: 431 Hz - 35.61 Hz = 395.38 Hz</p><p>And there&apos;s your answer - the two tones just barely fit in there. So<br/>why is it that you see beating all along the range between the two<br/>frequencies - the above would suggest that this is really fragile, and<br/>should only occur at an extremely narrow range around the midpoint,<br/>right? The reason is that although we like to talk about ERBs around<br/>here - that the bandwidth at this or that frequency is xxx Hz -<br/>they&apos;re just a simplification. The auditory filter doesn&apos;t actually<br/>have a rectangular response; its bandwidth is infinite and its<br/>frequency response extends outward in all directions, tapering off<br/>slowly. So the max beating occurs at the midpoint, and the beating<br/>lessens as you diverge away from the midpoint. Thus the fact that the<br/>gammatone filters don&apos;t exactly match the above are probably due to<br/>limitations in the accuracy of the frequency spreading of the gamma<br/>distribution as it applies to the cochlea, and due to limitations in<br/>the accuracy of using ERBs to represent the actual bandwidth of the<br/>auditory filter.</p><p>Phew! So the next step, then, is to come up with &quot;faux-periodicity<br/>buzz&quot; examples for harmonic waveforms - I suspect that we&apos;ll discover<br/>that the &quot;ideal&quot; frequencies for faux-periodicity buzz, when harmonic<br/>waveforms are involved, are related to rational intonation.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2011 6:23:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Interesting experiments.

As for linear evenness: you&apos;re right. A<br/>chord like 16:17:19 exhibits periodicity buzz, despite the fact that<br/>11-9 is 2 and 9-8 is 1. I ran this chord through the gauntlet and this<br/>is what I got:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/161719buzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/161719buzz.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/161719buzz.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/161719buzz.png</a></p><p>I wasn&apos;t as successful at making the buzz vary across the spectrum<br/>because this chord is so smushed together, but if you listen<br/>carefully, you can still hear some change between the fourth example<br/>as it works back to the first one (almost sounds like FM is taking<br/>place... ?!). A look at the gammatone plot reveals somewhat what&apos;s<br/>going on here, in that the bottom dyad is buzzing half as fast as the<br/>upper dyad, but only if the phases are out of alignment (haven&apos;t done<br/>the math yet to see why this is).</p><p>However, since the difference between 16 and 17 and 17 and 19 are<br/>harmonically related (one is twice as fast as the other), the buzz<br/>still ends up being in a recurring pattern. Here&apos;s another example,<br/>32:34:37, which means that the buzz ends up being in a 3 against 2<br/>polyrhythm:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/323437buzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/323437buzz.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/323437buzz.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/323437buzz.png</a></p><p>You also hear a bit of pitch fluctuation going on, especially when the<br/>phases are staggered - looking at the gammatone filter plot can be<br/>somewhat revealing as to why this happens.</p><p>So I do still think that linear evenness is what&apos;s important, but a<br/>generalized version of linear evenness: as long as the difference in<br/>frequencies between the notes in a chord end up being harmonically<br/>related to each other, there will be buzz (provided the notes are<br/>close enough together in pitch for this to happen). This is what&apos;s<br/>going on when you deal with buzz in harmonic waveforms: if you have<br/>500 Hz and 400 Hz playing together, you&apos;ll get buzz at 100 Hz, but<br/>then you have 1000 Hz and 800 Hz as well, so you get buzz at 200 Hz,<br/>etc. The whole thing forms a 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:... polyrhythm. An<br/>omnipolyrhythm, I guess.</p><p>The next step is to figure out if faux-periodicity buzz can occur for<br/>harmonic waveforms that doesn&apos;t sound like crap. If you play a<br/>linearly stretched 4:5:6:7 with a harmonic waveform, the overtones<br/>themselves aren&apos;t stretched, so you&apos;re going to get a multiplicity of<br/>buzz rates as the 2 of the stretched 3 beats against the 3 of the<br/>stretched 2, and these rates will NOT be in a coherent polyrhythm as<br/>described above. Rather, I think they&apos;ll be in some kind of polyrhythm<br/>with all of the buzz rates offset by a linear frequency, which is no<br/>good (just a hunch). 4:5:6 is a nicer-sounding polyrhythm than<br/>4.13:5.13:6.13 :)</p><p>So here&apos;s the fundamental question: is there a way to put the buzzing<br/>in a coherent relationship, between both the root notes and all of<br/>their harmonics, even if the notes aren&apos;t in a rational relationship?<br/>That is, Jacques has done some pioneering work on equal beating<br/>chords. Is there some additional constraint that can be added to the<br/>construction of these chords such that the result sounds like<br/>periodicity buzz? I think so, but let&apos;s find out! :)</p><p>&gt; I wonder about the new method of error optimization, would you aim for<br/>&gt; linear evenness and low error at the same time or what?</p><p>Something like that I think, yes, although since it looks like the<br/>generalized definition of linear evenness I wrote above is what<br/>actually matters, there will be more than one option for each chord to<br/>be optimized, I think.

If this is done, I<br/>think the whole thing probably will probably lead to a discrete set of<br/>frequencies for the fundamental that correspond to something like<br/>w-coherent brats, or &quot;super-brats,&quot; a super-brat being a brat in which<br/>all of the harmonics beat in sync with the fundamentals as well (or<br/>beat in a polyrhythm with the fundamentals). I&apos;m not sure this<br/>discrete set is a subset of the rationals - it might be possible to<br/>construct super-brats with irrational intervals as well. Maybe.</p><p>It would probably be easy to do this by tempering the octaves in your<br/>tuning, but a very, very interesting subset of this would be<br/>super-brats where the octaves are pure.</p><p>To further demonstrate, here are two examples of &quot;5-limit&quot; chords that<br/>have w-coherent brats: 10:12:15 and 16:19:24. 16:19:24 is close enough<br/>to be mapped to the 5-limit that we can consider it to actually be a<br/>tempered version of the 5-limit. The brats for 10:12:15 and 16:19:24<br/>are different - you&apos;ll see periodicity buzz in a 2:3 for ratio for the<br/>first chord, and in a 3:5 ratio for the second chord.

And by &quot;harmonic&quot; relationship, I mean that<br/>(c-b) and (b-a) are related by some kind of integer ratio, not that<br/>the notes themselves are in a harmonic relationship.

So It doesn&apos;t actually have to do with<br/>periodicity, but with this harmonic difference relationship type of<br/>thing, which I have termed &quot;linear evenness.&quot; This concept generalizes<br/>to n-ads as you&apos;d expect, and check out the examples and gammatone<br/>filter plots posted earlier in this thread for proof of this. So in a<br/>sense, periodicity buzz is synchronized roughness between the notes of<br/>an n-ad, and roughness is a special form of beating.</p><p>Anyway, assuming you&apos;ve followed all that, my goal was to come up with<br/>examples that buzz coherently even for harmonic timbres. This means<br/>that not only do (c-b) and (b-a) have to be in a harmonic<br/>relationship, but (2c-a) and (c-2a) and (3a-2c) and (5a-4b) and, in<br/>general, (n*a-m*b) for any set of integers n and m have to be in a<br/>harmonic relationship. This means that we want to apply equal beating<br/>techniques here, but also make it such that the rate of beating in the<br/>partials is harmonically synchronized with the rate of buzzing itself.<br/>The only solution I can find for this is to use rational intonation,<br/>the simplest example of which is recurrent sequences. Maybe another<br/>exists, but I&apos;m not seeing it.</p><p>So if you&apos;re linearly stretching 4:5:6:7, for example, with sines, any<br/>linearly stretched 4:5:6:7 (e.g. 4:4+d:4+2d:4+3d) will buzz evenly.<br/>For complex timbres you&apos;ll find that the maximum points of<br/>synchronized buzz occur at chords like</p><p>0.000 409.244 740.006 1017.596<br/>0.000 404.442 732.064 1007.442<br/>0.000 401.303 726.865 1000.788<br/>0.000 399.090 723.197 996.090</p><p>The top chord has the simplest buzz ratio but is also pretty severely<br/>tempered from a VF standpoint. As you go down more, the buzz becomes<br/>more complex (and slower), but the chord moves closer to the ideal<br/>4:5:6:7. To strike a midpoint between the two would be really<br/>interesting.

Even<br/>if the buzzing is really slow, I still hear a difference between<br/>318:397:476 and 318:397.151:476.302, for example.

[see, I was listening to your examples]</p><p>&gt; Specifically it&apos;s that a sine wave simultaneously excites<br/>&gt; all of the hairs nearby a certain peak frequency in the<br/>&gt; basilar membrane, so why wouldn&apos;t 6:7 be close enough to<br/>&gt; produce some kind of small perturbation?</p><p>7/6 is larger than a CB in this range and anything larger<br/>than CB/2 is well-resolved enough not to create anything like<br/>periodicity buzz. That&apos;s easy to test with irrational<br/>intervals.  [of similar size which do not buzz]</p><p>There&apos;s no roughness in the 7:6 here. And it&apos;s looking more<br/>and more to me like periodicity buzz is an audible time-<br/>domain thing...</p><p>&gt; &gt; In the example I posted, I definitely hear a buzz frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; corresponding to the waveform period. I feel like I may also<br/>&gt; &gt; be hearing some faster buzz rates superimposed, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; hard to tell.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which example that you posted?</p><p>Sorry, let me rephrase that. In every example of periodicity<br/>buzz I&apos;ve ever heard, I believe I hear a buzz rate corresponding<br/>to the approximate (if tempered) waveform period. I feel there<br/>may also be faster buzz rates superimposed, but it&apos;s hard to<br/>tell for sure.</p><p>&gt; In the frequency domain, the convolution will cancel out all<br/>&gt; frequencies except those which are at integer multiples of the<br/>&gt; fundamental. So it&apos;s a good idea to come up with periodic<br/>&gt; versions of the above three waveforms to evaluate their impact<br/>&gt; on the periodicity buzz produced.</p><p>Can you explain what you think any of this has to do with<br/>periodicity buzz? I&apos;m not sure I hear any in your examples,<br/>and I certainly don&apos;t in most ordinary (harmonic) timbres.</p><p>&gt; You seemed to have a different opinion when I played the &quot;buzz&quot;<br/>&gt; waveform a while ago, which sparked you onto this new train of<br/>&gt; thought that it was only the time domain that mattered.</p><p>My own investigations sparked that.

The time domain plot is<br/>filtered by every hair on the basilar membrane, producing thousands of<br/>parallel time domain plots. Looking at the outputs of THESE waveforms,<br/>e.g. the auditory filtered outputs, actually will tell you something<br/>about the behavior of the system, and the paper I linked to in the<br/>other thread does exactly this - looks at the envelope fluctuations<br/>from each filtered output. If you want to see the envelope<br/>fluctuations of each filtered output, a simple way is to use a<br/>gammatone filterbank.</p><p>Now, if you&apos;re trying to make the argument that the brain adds up the<br/>time domain waveform and sees the original again, and then gets buzz<br/>from it - first off, the statement that the waveform has more spikes,<br/>and that the waveform is phase locked, are the same thing. They are<br/>not different. When I talk about the phase of the frequencies in the<br/>waveform, I don&apos;t think that the Fourier artifice of &quot;phase&quot; is<br/>directly what&apos;s at work. I think that the delay and offset between the<br/>constituent sinusoids is what matters.</p><p>In the time domain, this manifests as spiky waveforms. In the<br/>frequency domain, it manifests as non-uniform group delay. And in a<br/>mixed time-frequency plot like a gammatone filter bank, it manifests<br/>as the buzz being placed in complementary positions with one another.<br/>All three of these are equivalent statements, because there is no such<br/>thing as &quot;time-domain&quot; vs &quot;frequency-domain&quot; processing - these are<br/>words that we use to describe the perspective we take to analyze the<br/>behavior of a physical system, not the behavior of the system itself.<br/>Statements made in the time domain can be turned into equivalent<br/>statements in the frequency domain, and vice-versa. It&apos;s like us<br/>arguing about whether the brain is making use of an &quot;object-oriented&quot;<br/>or a &quot;procedural&quot; algorithm to perform f0 estimation.</p><p>Anyway, assuming you understand that, the statement that spiker<br/>waveforms = more buzz is the same thing as saying phase coherence =<br/>more buzz, you&apos;re just taking a different frame on the whole thing.<br/>This still doesn&apos;t propose a mechanism for why spikier waveforms would<br/>produce more buzz than non-spikier waveforms. Filterbanks propose such<br/>a mechanism. If you&apos;re more fond of thinking about things along<br/>&quot;time-domain&quot; lines, I could reformulate my statements about the<br/>cochlea from a time-domain perspective, although I think that would be<br/>even more confusing.</p><p>&gt; I found some time domain plots, though not next to<br/>&gt; matching gammatone plots with the same time scale<br/>&gt; (see below).
