They<br/>are only in the incidental music following the first  act.  I have the score<br/>somewhere, two pages long using the  microtones.</p><p>BTW, focusing only on keyboard leaves out Johann Philipp Kirnberger using<br/>the 7/4 in his music, played by the flute.  But it&apos;s true, no one seems to  be<br/>using a microtonal system in the Western world.  Except for folk  musics,<br/>perhaps (Rhaetian, Sapmi, Sardinian).  Maybe 12-tET was such a hand  full as a<br/>microtonal system (instruments had to be outfitted to play in it), and  as Kraig<br/>said, quartertones at 50 cent intervals only began after its  hegemony.</p><p>Johnny</p><p>**************Start the year off right.
