The<br/>musical example is here:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/17496-16807-comma-pump-subminor-34-equal">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/17496-16807-comma-pump-subminor-34-equal</a></p><p>The chord progression takes advantage of the fact that 5 7/6&apos;s is<br/>equated with 9/4, which means that 17496/16807 vanishes. Looks like<br/>the rank-3 7-limit temperament is here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=26_9_8d&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=26_9_8d&limit=7</a></p><p>The best rank-2 option is here...</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_8d&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_8d&limit=7</a></p><p>And if we bump this up to the 13-limit, we suddenly get the name<br/>&quot;Progression&quot; on it:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_8d&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_8d&limit=13</a></p><p>OK, so we&apos;re in &quot;Progression&quot; temperament now, cool. Now, the question<br/>is, what&apos;s the best way to label this comma pump? Should I really call<br/>a Progression comma pump? The problem in this case is that when we&apos;re<br/>dealing with something like a 7-limit rank-2 temperament, two commas<br/>vanish, so the phrase &quot;Progression comma pump&quot; is indeterminate and<br/>could be any one of an infinite number of commas. Would a good way to<br/>describe this be that the above chord progression is a 17496/16807<br/>comma pump, which is supported by Progression temperament? I need to<br/>name this something on my Soundcloud, and &quot;Progression Comma Pump&quot; is<br/>a lot catchier than &quot;17496/16807 Comma Pump,&quot; but it might be pretty<br/>misleading.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98905 href="#98905">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2011 11:43:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; The chord progression takes advantage of the fact that 5 7/6&apos;s is<br/>&gt; equated with 9/4, which means that 17496/16807 vanishes.

It also opens up the question of how we&apos;re supposed to<br/>describe comma pumps for codimension &gt; 1 temperaments. We can talk<br/>about something like a &quot;hanson comma pump&quot; or a &quot;negri comma pump&quot;<br/>because there&apos;s only one comma that we could possibly be talking<br/>about. Talking about a &quot;progression comma pump&quot; is indeterminate,<br/>however, as would be talking about a &quot;miracle comma pump&quot; (which<br/>miracle comma is getting pumped)?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98910 href="#98910">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2011 3:57:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; Talking about a &quot;progression comma pump&quot; is indeterminate,<br/>&gt; however, as would be talking about a &quot;miracle comma pump&quot; (which<br/>&gt; miracle comma is getting pumped)?</p><p>In the 5-limit field, I think it&apos;s called the &quot;Ampersand&apos;s comma&quot;.

It&apos;s the 7-limit evil twin to porcupine, in a few<br/>ways. Firstly, if we ignore the existence of 5 completely, we end up<br/>with this temperament:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=8_9&limit=2.3.7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=8_9&limit=2.3.7</a></p><p>Just like how porcupine has a generator that&apos;s half a 6/5, this one<br/>has a generator that&apos;s half a 7/6. Secondly, while in porcupine, three<br/>6/5&apos;s plus a 9/8 gets you to the octave, in this temperament four<br/>7/6&apos;s minus a 9/8 gets you to an octave. Lastly, porcupine is the 7&amp;8<br/>temperament, and this is the 8&amp;9 temperament, meaning they also<br/>generate similarly sized MOS&apos;s.</p><p>I was trying to figure out what the generator for this temperament<br/>would be, but it turned into a huge chore. After doing a lot of<br/>reading on something called &quot;Diophantine Equations,&quot; it turns out that<br/>all possible mappings for the generator satisfy p_3 = 3+7t and p_7 =<br/>-2-5t. I plugged in t=0 to get [0 3 -2&gt; for the 2.3.7 smonzo for the<br/>generator, which turns out to be 27/49. Convinced that I&apos;ve screwed<br/>something up, I now hereby end this stream of consciousness post in<br/>hopes that you can tell me what exactly I did wrong here.</p><p>On second look, it seems pretty obvious that to find the generator,<br/>you&apos;re going to want to not only solve &lt;V|M&gt; = 1 for the generator,<br/>but &lt;V|M&gt; = 0 for the period. Since the generator mapping for 2 is<br/>zero, we can transpose the above up to get 54/49. Some kind of<br/>one-shot kill formalization of all of this would be great. Is it that<br/>I end up with two systems of equations and three variables then?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98912 href="#98912">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2011 4:59:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, May 9, 2011 at 6:57 PM, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 5-limit field, I think it&apos;s called the &quot;Ampersand&apos;s comma&quot;.
