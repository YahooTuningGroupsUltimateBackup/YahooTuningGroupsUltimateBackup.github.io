I think our approach is similar in the sense that we both<br/>enjoy hearing familiar-ish harmonic progressions recast/morphed with<br/>detailed microtonal nuance.. To me, the power of these intervals is most<br/>easily heard (initially, at least) in a context that is already rich in<br/>meaning, like classical or jazz derived progressions. That way, what it is<br/>that makes these intervals striking is clearly set off against the<br/>background of the more familiar progression. Some might accuse us of<br/>&quot;putting new wine in old bottles&quot; but I look at it as the best of both<br/>worlds: mixing the old wine with the new wine to make uber-wine!</p><p>Its interesting that you&apos;re exploring 22TET and my guitar is 21TJI. We&apos;re<br/>slicing the octave into roughly the same number of bits and I think this<br/>similarity of &quot;resolution&quot; is audible, especially when heard against<br/>traditional harmonic progressions. Does that make any sense to you? Of<br/>course there is a qualitative difference due to the E vs. J, with E being<br/>(to my ears) &quot;active&quot; and J being more &quot;abiding&quot;</p><p>Looking forward to hearing a guitar piece of yours on Tuning Punks soon!</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=7020 href="#7020">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I do try to make totally new wine sometimes too,<br/>but since my ear is the strongest guiding force in composing, and my ear has<br/>been conditioned by the culture in which I live, I seem to have more<br/>confidence when I &quot;give in&quot; a bit to tradition.</p><p>&gt;Its interesting that you&apos;re exploring 22TET and my guitar is 21TJI.

Does that make any sense to you?</p><p>Well, I&apos;m not exactly sure what you&apos;re saying, but there is a similarity<br/>between the 22-tET and JI in that they both express the syntonic comma,<br/>which is supposed to disappear in traditional harmonic progressions, and in<br/>all the tunings (i.e. varieties of meantone) designed to support them.<br/>However, this is not exactly a function of the number of &quot;bits&quot; -- for<br/>example, 15-tET has a non-vanishing comma while 81-tET has a vanishing one.</p><p>&gt;Of<br/>&gt;course there is a qualitative difference due to the E vs. J, with E being<br/>&gt;(to my ears) &quot;active&quot; and J being more &quot;abiding&quot;</p><p>Yes. If that was all there was to it, I&apos;d prefer JI. But another important<br/>qualitative difference to me is that in E, the same note can function as<br/>different ratios. For example, I&apos;ll analyze the beginning TIBIA in JI, up<br/>through the modulation:</p><p> 5/4---6/5---7/6---8/7--10/9--16/15-81/80....63/32-15/8....<br/> 1/1---1/1---1/1---1/1---1/1---1/1-243/128...27/16--3/2....<br/>15/8---9/5---7/4--12/7---5/3---8/5-243/160...45/32-45/32...<br/> 1/1---8/5---***--10/7--16/9---4/3--27/16.....9/8---3/2....</p><p>In 22-tET 12/7 and 27/16 are represented by the same pitch, as are 10/7 and<br/>45/32, 7/4 and 16/9, 8/7 and 9/8, and even 1/1 and 63/32(63/64). The *** can<br/>be interpreted as either 4/3 or 21/16. On your JI guitar, you&apos;re kind of<br/>limited with regard to which ratios you can imply, though the harmonic<br/>variety is enough to keep things interesting.</p></div>
