The larger the small step is, the better we are at<br/>distinguishing the intervals in #1.<br/>- The potentially ambiguous intervals in #2 differ by c, or the<br/>chroma. The larger the chroma is, the better we are at distinguishing<br/>the intervals in #2.<br/>- The potentially ambiguous intervals in #3 differ by s-c, or the<br/>diesis. The larger the diesis is, the better we are at distinguishing<br/>the intervals in #3.</p><p>Now let&apos;s weight each factor. It obviously doesn&apos;t matter as much how<br/>big the diesis is in something like the diatonic scale, where it only<br/>appears for one interval - one A4 vs one P5 - vs something like the<br/>Pajara SPM scale, where it appears between the four M3s and the four<br/>m4&apos;s, and also between the six M4s and two m5&apos;s. We&apos;ll weight each<br/>factor by the total number of ambiguous intervals presented in each<br/>case. So for diatonic, #1 would be weighted by 2, and for SPM, it<br/>would be weighted by 16.</p><p>We hence want to maximize the following equation, where w1, w2, and w3<br/>are the number of intervals falling into #1, #2, and #3 respectively,<br/>and CI is categorical independence:</p><p>CI = w1(s) + w2(c) + w3(s-c)</p><p>It&apos;s 4 AM and I have to sleep, but I&apos;ll come back to this. I stumbled<br/>on this concept after playing with Pajara standard pentachordal major<br/>in 22-equal, and hating, as I always do, how the minor fourths, set at<br/>327 cents, and the major thirds, set at 273 cents, sound so close to<br/>one another. Experimenting with Pajara in 32- and 42-equal, where the<br/>difference between these intervals is 75 and 86 cents, respectively,<br/>blew my mind. I urge you all to try it, focusing more on categorical<br/>perception than purity of intonation.</p><p>I think that once you get past looking at MOS&apos;s the concept is going<br/>to end up being, more or less, a weighted version of Carl&apos;s &quot;rank<br/>range&quot; concept.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2011 11:52:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s 4 AM and I have to sleep, but I&apos;ll come back to this.

I think it&apos;s closer to<br/>stability, however, than anything. Perhaps it&apos;s a new type of thing,<br/>for which &quot;categorical independence&quot; would be the best word for it.</p><p>Here&apos;s one possible way to do it: lay all of the intervals out on a<br/>ruler, as Carl did. Work out the meta-intervals between each interval,<br/>as with Carl&apos;s approach. Now take a weighted average of the size of<br/>all of these meta-intervals, weighted by the number of times that they<br/>appear in the scale (e.g. the total number of times that the intervals<br/>on either side of the meta-interval appear).</p><p>I think that scales in which this average is maximized will be easier<br/>to learn than those that aren&apos;t. If the average is maximized, each<br/>interval will be positioned maximally far away from the other ones,<br/>which will lead to less confusion. Another way to think of this is<br/>that it will generate the &quot;most unequal&quot; tuning for an MOS, which is<br/>what I was originally looking for when I started this whole thing.<br/>There may be a few nits to pick in the above definition to get it to<br/>work smoothly, but from the perspective of my caffeine-fueled brain at<br/>9 AM, it looks pretty good.</p><p>For MOS&apos;s, the L/s value at which the average is maximized should vary<br/>depending on the MOS. For intervals with less ambiguous intervals,<br/>e.g. those differing by the |s-c| diesis, the value should be closer<br/>to 2/1. For intervals with more ambiguous intervals, it should be<br/>further from that, although I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;ll end up closer to 3/2<br/>or 3/1.</p><p>A problem presents itself for irregular tunings that deliberately have<br/>a lot of intervals that center around some general size, but vary<br/>slightly from it. This measure will only consider the meta-intervals<br/>between adjacent intervals, so these slight intonational differences<br/>will turn up as meta-intervals that are supposed to be maximized, and<br/>hence the weighting will end up going screwy. I think a good approach<br/>for this is to consider the average difference between every interval<br/>and ALL other intervals in the scale, even those on the other<br/>half-octave of it, but I want to start with the above first and work<br/>from there.</p><p>I&apos;m moving a lot slower these days than I used to, but I&apos;ll crunch<br/>some numbers soon.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
