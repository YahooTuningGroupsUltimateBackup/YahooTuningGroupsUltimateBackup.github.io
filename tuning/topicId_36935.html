In fact, the opposite is true.  His music is mostly<br/>played by professional groups in Europe, such as Ensemble<br/>Intercontemporain, Ensemble Fa, etc., plus orchestras like Birmingham,<br/>Paris, numerous German orchestras, etc.</p><p>So, when he&apos;s talking about players having problems with 1/4-tones, these<br/>are professionals.  . . and professionals in Europe, where microtonality<br/>is much more accepted as a line of investigation in composition (in the<br/>sense that the following statement is much more likely to be uttered in<br/>the USA:  &quot;Microtonality?  Why are you still pursuing that crap? . . .etc.<br/>etc.&quot;)</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t work towards a brighter  future, but the<br/>current reality is. . . largely the reality,  Johnny&apos;s players,  and some<br/>other brave folks excepted.</p><p>Actually, I should note that Murail occasionally uses 1/8-tones<br/>also, but only when a clear harmonic effect is desired.  For example, for<br/>a JI 7th harmonic---and again, he&apos;s assuming that the player will &quot;adjust&quot;<br/>to put the note exactly in JI.</p><p>For this kind of thing, I agree that 72-tet is a good next step in the<br/>&quot;microtonalizing of the music world at large.&quot;   The fact that there is a<br/>clear ear-training method makes it seem more attractive than many other<br/>solutions.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2002 1:49:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36935">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36935</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For this kind of thing, I agree that 72-tet is a good next step in<br/>the &quot;microtonalizing of the music world at large.&quot;   The fact that<br/>there is a clear ear-training method makes it seem more attractive<br/>than many other solutions.</p><p>***To my mind, this is the single most important thing I have learned<br/>from the 2+ years on this list!</p><p>Remember, it wasn&apos;t *my* idea originally *at all.*  I learned it all<br/>here.</p><p>J.
