I would like to feed into the sound card analog music<br/>&gt; using the external jack on the card and have it converted into a MIDI file.</p><p>Not as standard, but you can get software to do it. Usually they convert<br/>to the nearest twelve equal notes. Mixed results - it is quite a programming<br/>challenge and they tend to add extra notes to the music.</p><p>I&apos;ve been experimenting with this also in my Tune Smithy program<br/>- there I&apos;ve concentrated on trying to convert a single part to midi,<br/>no attempt at polyphony, and to try to get the pitch as accurate as<br/>possible - of course not 12-et.</p><p>It actually works fairly well now for slow-ish tunes on descant<br/>recorder. Very variable depending on the instrument one uses.<br/>I hope to do much more work on this later on.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>View | Analyse Recording or Midi Voice | Find Seed.<br/>The wave counting method usually works best at present, where you unselect<br/>Use frequency spectrum.</p><p>However I don&apos;t make much of it yet as it is a very new feature and<br/>still rather kind of experimental. In fact I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve done<br/>any help for it yet at all.</p><p>But basic idea is you make a recording, or open one using the<br/>Open Audio file of Seed button. Then click the Find and -&gt; Seed<br/>button. Select Play on -&gt; Seed, and Record to Midi, and<br/>you give the file name for the midi recording in Bs | Record to File Options.</p><p>Anyway not much developed but if you are interested to try it out and<br/>want to ask how to do something then I&apos;m delighted to help with it,<br/>as far as it goes so far. It&apos;s something I plan to go back to.</p><p>I actually also used it to make some conversions of birdsong to midi<br/>- though this required a lot of tweaking and it doesn&apos;t have any preset<br/>options to do this yet, in fact not sure if present version can still<br/>do this as this was a fair while ago using an earlier version of the wave 2 midi.</p><p><a href="http://www.musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk/cards/birdsong.htm">http://www.musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk/cards/birdsong.htm</a></p><p>I don&apos;t know of any other program that attempts to convert wave to midi<br/>with the exact pitches of the original rather than the nearest<br/>12 equal pitch.</p><p>There are quite a few of the twelve equal ones and I&apos;ve<br/>tried some of them, forget the names now. With mixed results as<br/>explained, they all tend to add a few extra notes.</p><p>Here is one I just found in a web search, not sure if I&apos;ve tried<br/>it yet.</p><p><a href="http://www.5star-shareware.com/Music/MIDIPlayersandUtilities/sound2midi.html">http://www.5star-shareware.com/Music/MIDIPlayersandUtilities/sound2midi.html</a></p><p>There&apos;s quite a lot of interest in this field. The reason it is hard to do<br/>is that the ear is just amazingly good at picking out musical notes, and<br/>it is extremely hard to parallel that in software. One can find all the<br/>pitches in the spectrum - that&apos;s easy enough, but one can&apos;t easily figure out<br/>which of the pitches in the sound spectrum belong to which instruments, which ones<br/>are just background noise or incidental noise that you get while playing<br/>the instrument.</p><p>Perhaps this is a bit related to vision where the same thing<br/>happens - that software can anlyse a picture in great detail but is<br/>easily lost if you try to get it to count particular types of object<br/>in the picture or something like that. It&apos;s a pattern recognition<br/>problem - how to recognise a particular instrument, which the<br/>ear does readily while current software programs find it so hard to<br/>do the same thing.</p><p>Anyway that&apos;s a perspective from someone who has attempted to probram it<br/>in software. I don&apos;t have much experience thoug of using the 12-et<br/>wav2midi programs, maybe others here do?...</p><p>Robert</p></div>
