You can get constructive or destructive<br/>interference, depending on how you line up the different sources. If<br/>you have spacially separate sound sources which are phase-locked with<br/>one another, then your position in space relative to the sound<br/>sources will determine whether you have constructive or destructive<br/>interference. Moving around the room, you will find spots where any<br/>given common overtone get louder, and spots where it gets softer,<br/>while the amplitude of any partial that only comes from a single<br/>source remains the same.</p><p>&gt; but why will not this depend on the answer.<br/>&gt; Although i can kinda see that the one way the peaks will coincide<br/>and the<br/>&gt; volume would be louder. Etc.<br/>&gt; But i have never noticed this with real sound .If i play the same<br/>chord<br/>&gt; over and over at the same attack the volume does not vary even<br/>though the<br/>&gt; phases is bound too.</p><p>Really? I notice this variation all the time. Play octaves (about the<br/>only pure JI interval you&apos;re likely to find on a synth) using a sound<br/>with harmonic partials. Every time you strike the octave, you hear a<br/>different set of partials reinforced. I&apos;ve noticed this with a wide<br/>variety of makes of synthesizer.</p><p>Of course, the perceptual importance of partials to music is often<br/>exaggerated.</p><p>&gt; Was it here that there was the discussion of a sine<br/>&gt; being really a 2 d version of a three dimensional spiral?</p><p>This is true for light but not for sound. Sound consists of<br/>longitudinal pressure variations, so in this sense it&apos;s a one-<br/>dimensional wave and not two-dimensional at all. You may be thinking<br/>of Charles Lucy&apos;s stuff, which I&apos;m sorry to say is not scientific.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You&apos;ve always referred to beating sonorities as &quot;louder&quot;, so<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe maximum of some short-term amplitude is what you&apos;re after?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; possibly, or maybe the maximum possible amplitude</p><p>Well, the maximum possible amplitude would be greatest if everything<br/>is in phase. When it&apos;s beating the amplitude is easy to calculation --<br/>RMS just gives you the sum of the individual RMS amplitudes -- while<br/>the amplitude for waves in phase would be higher.</p><p>On the psychology of hearing certain chords as we hear single<br/>timbres . . . this research has recently been taken into the<br/>neurological realm.

I assumed you were using JI, and when you said the adjacent<br/>intervals were 5:4 and 4:3 (thus implying harmonic numbers 12-15-20),<br/>I took you at your word. The chord 8-10-13 would certainly score as<br/>more concordant or &quot;hard&quot; than 12-15-20 on the factor considered in<br/>my comment you quoted above, but as more discordant on some other<br/>factors, particularly those like roughness that depend primarily on<br/>the concordance of the individual dyads. 13:8 and 13:10 are by no<br/>means simple-integer dyads of the sort that exhibit the<br/>stereotypical &apos;smoothness&apos; of, say, 5:4 and 4:3. 8-10-13 is a highly<br/>non-traditional chord, but certainly a harmonically convincing one in<br/>certain microtonal contexts. 9-11-15 is another example that is about<br/>equally close to 12-15-20. If you join the harmonic entropy group,<br/>you can visually see the relationship between all these triads at</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/Erlich/closeup.jp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/Erlich/closeup.jp</a><br/>g</p><p>.</p><p>&gt; Does that effect your comments<br/>&gt; regarding the &apos;highness&apos; of the harmonic numbers?</p><p>My comments are based on an analysis which takes *all* nearby,<br/>similar chords, and the confusion they might lead to, into account.<br/>It turns out that the simpler the &apos;harmonic numbers&apos;, the further<br/>away the closest other harmonic chords are, and thus the lower the<br/>confusion. As long as the numbers are not terribly high, this<br/>relationship is a very close one and I don&apos;t see any room for effects<br/>such as the &quot;already-reducedness&quot; you mention below. Look at this<br/>graph:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/triadic.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/triadic.gif</a></p><p>For each harmonic-series triad a:b:c, this shows the area in triad<br/>space of the set of points closer to a:b:c than to any other harmonic-<br/>series triad x:y:z such that x*y*z is less than a million. Until one<br/>gets to some quite high-numbered triads, this area is very close to<br/>being inversely proportional to the cube root of a*b*c. So the lower<br/>the numbers, the less the ambiguity of how the chord fits into the<br/>harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; Relatedly, what if the chord represented in high harmonic numbers<br/>is,<br/>&gt; so to speak, &apos;locked in&apos; as an already-reduced simple fraction<br/>(such<br/>&gt; as c-e-b, 5/4x3/2=15/8.)  That is, in light of your idea that the c-<br/>e-<br/>&gt; a chord is &quot;the most ambiguous, since the higher the numbers, the<br/>&gt; closer the<br/>&gt; approximation to other harmonic-series chords&quot;, does a chord which<br/>&gt; literally &apos;adds up&apos; to an already-reduced higher fraction (such as<br/>&gt; 5/4x3/2=15/8), share this interesting ambiguity you discussed, as<br/>&gt; opposed to, say, 5/4x6/5=30/20, or as compared to the c-e-a chord,<br/>&gt; with its different representations (different representations of<br/>the<br/>&gt; c-e-a chord discussed above?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m still following you, but I could mention here that<br/>just as c-e-a or 12-15-20 has several harmonic-series subsets nearby,<br/>so does c-e-g or 4-5-6 (9:11:13, 10:13:15, 11:14:16, 11:14:17, as you<br/>can see on the first graph above) and c-e-b or 8-10-15 (7:9:13,<br/>9:11:17, 10:13:19, 11:14:21, etc).</p><p>Looking forward to your return,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=53535 href="#53535">ðŸ”—</a>traktus5 &#x3C;kj4321@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2004 1:55:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul - a question regarding your earlier email...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Kelly wondered if chords with harmonic numbers 1,2,4,8, etc, had<br/>more &quot;acoustical energy&quot;, and wrote: &quot;since the &apos;pitch space&apos; is<br/>&gt; &gt; specifically log2, the doubling series, with each doubling of<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency representing a fixed interval (the octave)...,&quot;</p><p>&gt;Paul responded: &quot;Well that&apos;s true for any base, not just 2.

All bases are equivalent, up to a constant. If have x and<br/>you want to take the log base b of it, just take your favorite log of<br/>x and then divide by the same kind of log of b.</p></div>
