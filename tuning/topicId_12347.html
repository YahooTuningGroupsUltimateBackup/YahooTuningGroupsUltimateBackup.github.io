A few minutes into the composition, Johnny Reinhard begins<br/>to use multiphonics. I&apos;m wondering if you are able to somewhat<br/>precisely notate the multiphonic intervals for the performer, in a<br/>piece such as this? Sounds like to me that Johnny is playing some<br/>very precision multiphonic pitches in this portion of the<br/>composition. Or perhaps you leave this kind of choice up to the<br/>performer? How is it that you transmit this information in your<br/>score, to the performer when multiphonics are required?</p><p>I also would like to ask if this is an example of using 24 tET as a<br/>notational reference point? Anyway this is a wonderful piece -<br/>impeccably performed by Johnny Reinhard!!!</p><p>Thanks kindly,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=12350 href="#12350">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2000 7:46:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacky Ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ekstasis@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12347">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12347</a></p><p>I&apos;m wondering if you are able to somewhat<br/>&gt; precisely notate the multiphonic intervals for the performer, in a<br/>&gt; piece such as this?

I<br/>would like to tell you that the multiphonics are based upon a system<br/>of finger pressure, notated through a system of experimental calculus<br/>which I invented.</p><p>However, that wouldn&apos;t be true.</p><p>The performer chooses the multiphonic.  In this case, with Johnny<br/>Reinhard, we have more than just a &quot;performer,&quot; we have Johnny<br/>Reinhard... which is why they came out so excellently.</p><p>My own personal experience is that every performer and even each<br/>INSTRUMENT (!!) renders multiphonics differently, so it is somewhat<br/>an exercise in frustration to try to notate them precisely.  Perhaps<br/>others have had greater &quot;success&quot; with this.  It&apos;s a nice idea,<br/>though!  Please let me know if anybody can do it.... Maybe with a<br/>little help from recorded samples of the &quot;desired&quot; multiphonic it<br/>could be done...</p><p>Sorry to disappoint in that capacity.  As you can see, however, when<br/>leaving this aspect to the performer choice, one DOES get optimal<br/>results... since the performer is really &quot;into&quot; the multiphonic<br/>he/she wishes to use...  I suppose that may be another factor.</p><p>This whole issue goes back to the Monz idea of the &quot;limitations&quot; of<br/>notation in the first place.  I&apos;m all for precision but, if I were to<br/>write a piece that sounded like a bunch of random pitches, I would be<br/>inclined to produce a graphic score, rather than a Milton Babbitt<br/>kind of construct which, ironically enough as many commentators have<br/>suggested, would really sound the same!  Simplicity and a direct<br/>approach are for me the key....</p><p> I also would like to ask if this is an example of using 24 tET as a<br/>&gt; notational reference point? Anyway this is a wonderful piece -<br/>&gt; impeccably performed by Johnny Reinhard!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>Thank you, again, so much for the compliment, and it certainly is<br/>true that Johnny is superb!</p><p>I should also note that the piece on my Web page:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/100/joseph_pehrson.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/100/joseph_pehrson.html</a></p><p>is only the first half of the piece.  Eventually, I am going to<br/>replace some of my &quot;samples&quot; with complete works on that site...</p><p>Frankly... I think Johnny and I were really thinking of this as a<br/>continuum of 48-tET rather than as alterations from 24-tET.  In fact,<br/>we have completed a chart that has ALL the 1/8th tones for the bassoon<br/>through the entire range.</p><p>As you can tell from the recording, Johnny REALLY CAN play 1/8 tones<br/>accurately, and there is a VERY CLEAR differentiation of the 25 cent<br/>differences.</p><p>We actually did quite well with this piece.  Johnny got a nice review<br/>in the New York Times with his photo playing it, and I got a mention<br/>in the article.  He also played it to great acclaim in Russia... both<br/>in Moscow and in Kazan, Russia.  I am very lucky that he has taken<br/>such an interest in it!!!!!</p><p>I believe the feasibility of the quartertone +/- 50<br/>cents notation is more questionable for pieces where the cents<br/>addition is not in such an even quantity.  For example, can someone<br/>REALLY PLAY ACCURATELY a quartertone +33 cents or whatever.</p><p>Paul Erlich has his doubts and advocates the system advanced by the<br/>Boston School of 72-tET, where there is distinct ear training of<br/>progressively smaller intervals (it&apos;s logical!), but Johnny Reinhard<br/>feels the players CAN make these close discriminations.</p><p>The jury is still out on this.  I need to &quot;study up&quot; a bit on the<br/>72-tET method (a book is coming my way!) and think about it some<br/>more... but I can&apos;t wait, since I&apos;m writing music NOW... well, not<br/>exactly right now, but you know what I mean... so I will use the<br/>quartertone +/- system until I find something &quot;better.&quot;</p><p>THANKS FOR ASKING!!!<br/>__________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks kindly,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon</p></div>
