If you happen<br/>&gt;                by and think something is amiss, &gt;I&apos;m around -- write me.</p><p>Among Graham Breed&apos;s many wonderful documents on his website, this one is of particular relevance to Partch and I believe should be linked to directly from your page:</p><p><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm</a></p><p>&gt;And...if you&apos;d like to write a succinct rebuttal &gt;or clarification of the<br/>&gt;issue of Helmholtz/Partch ideas<br/>&gt;of consonance and dissonance, I have a web<br/>&gt;site that has space waiting.</p><p>I would like to take you up on this offer in the near future and plan to include the necessary background for understanding the relevance of Graham&apos;s &quot;ass&quot; page in the context of Partch&apos;s philosophy.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve heard some very negative reactions to the &gt;&gt;Gilmore book from a lot of<br/>&gt;&gt;Partchophiles, though in my<br/>&gt;&gt;state of blissful<br/>&gt;&gt;ignorance as to the true<br/>&gt;&gt;number<br/>&gt;&gt;of sock-changes I enjoyed it<br/>&gt;&gt;thoroughly. What&apos;s your feeling?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d be curious as to what you consider a Partch &gt;person.</p><p>I just meant some of the people on this list who hold Partch&apos;s music, philosophy, and/or persona to have an almost religious sanctity. Although it&apos;s great to have people spreading the gospel, it bugs me when their efforts actually make it less likely that the average person will get to hear Partch&apos;s music. But I don&apos;t want to get into that debate again.</p><p>I&apos;m glad you approve of the Gilmore book, since it would be unfortunate if the (virtually) only available book on Partch, and such a well-written one, misrepresented important aspects of his life or music.</p><p>&gt;I look forward to the day that you can &gt;confidently publish all material, in<br/>&gt;perpetuity, glowing in the knowledge you&apos;ll &gt;never make an erroneous statement.</p><p>One does not have to be perfect in order to recognize, and point out, an error in someone else&apos;s work. That&apos;s all I was doing, and it&apos;s part of this very healthy thing called &quot;the open exchange of ideas&quot;. No one is presumed to be perfect, but through the process of debating, ideas get honed and all benefit from the criticism of others. I see that as one of the important functions of a list such as this, which deals with concepts on the frontiers and are not yet &quot;set in stone&quot;.</p><p>To react so strongly against criticism is an example of the type of quasi-religious fanaticism I was referring to, except that in this case you&apos;ve extended it beyond Partch and onto Gilmore as well.</p><p>&gt;Hey, anyone can make an erroneous statement. &gt;It&apos;s part of human nature.</p><p>That&apos;s much better, Amen.</p><p>&gt;You<br/>&gt;might be overlooking the fact that while some &gt;element of intonational<br/>&gt;theory may be clear to you, Paul, I looked back &gt;and realized that the<br/>&gt;original point was one that was &quot;opaque&quot; to none &gt;other than John Chalmers,<br/>&gt;who I don&apos;t exactly consider a babe in the woods &gt;concerning intonation and<br/>&gt;tuning.</p><p>Perhaps you or John could fill me in on what exactly you&apos;re referring to (if it&apos;s still relevant)?</p><p>&gt;I stand by my point: it&apos;s a *biography*, and if &gt;there may be a<br/>&gt;disagreement over what *you* consider a &gt;critically mis-reported truism,<br/>&gt;when looked at in it&apos;s entirety I find the book &gt;passes muster quite easily.</p><p>And again, I&apos;m very happy to hear this, as I enjoyed the book thoroughly.

That&apos;s all I was doing, and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;part of this very healthy thing called &quot;the open exchange of ideas&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;No one is presumed to be perfect [snip]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wait, Paul. You said before: &quot;That&apos;s fine, but it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s then OK<br/>&gt; for him to make erroneous statements on theoretical matters. Instead, he<br/>&gt; should make none at all.&quot; Tell me that doesn&apos;t sound like you presume him<br/>&gt; to be either perfect or silent.</p><p>I said that in response to you when you were implying that Gilmore&apos;s immediate warning that he was not endeavoring to study Partch&apos;s theory excused any subsequent erroneous statements about the theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt;To react so strongly against criticism is an example of the type of<br/>&gt; &gt;quasi-religious fanaticism I was referring to, except that in this<br/>&gt; &gt;case you&apos;ve extended it beyond Partch and onto Gilmore as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I was reacting to was not about subject matter but your heavy-handed<br/>&gt; statement about errors by authors. I found it neither enlightening (i.e.<br/>&gt; describing the errors) or realistic. I expect better from learned<br/>&gt; correspondents such as yourself.</p><p>Sorry for not describing the errors, but I&apos;ve made the odd vs. prime limit point about 50 times in the past few years on this list. I&apos;ll go through it again when I make a web page for you.</p><p>&gt; There are people that I debate, in other arenas beyond and besides music; I<br/>&gt; try to read posts in the same manner, looking for fairness and clarity.<br/>&gt; Your posts can be called into question, just as mine.</p><p>Definitely!</p><p>&gt; Finally, about the repeated use of &apos;religious&apos; as a negative descriptor:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll just read that as &apos;passionate&apos;. I do, and always will, feel<br/>&gt; passionately about the work of Partch. You will simply have to deal with<br/>&gt; it, just as I&apos;ve learned to be comfortable with endless streams of numbers.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean it as a negative comment.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Perhaps you or John could fill me in on what exactly you&apos;re referring<br/>&gt; &gt;to (if it&apos;s still relevant)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point was that you implied the error in the biography was something that<br/>&gt; should have easily been detected or corrected, while John Chalmers mentions<br/>&gt; the same area in a post to you as: &quot;Has anyone succeeded in reproducing<br/>&gt; Helmholtz&apos;s computations? I&apos;ve always found his description of how he<br/>&gt; computed the dissonance curves opaque.&quot; Maybe we&apos;re talking about two<br/>&gt; different subjects,</p><p>Yes of course we are. How could the opacity of Helmholtz&apos; computations of dissonance curves have anything to do with the question of whether Gilmore accurately described Partch&apos;s theory?</p><p>&gt; but that was when you hauled Gilmore on the carpet,<br/>&gt; whom you include in the religious-toned &quot;criminally unnoticed by all the<br/>&gt; prime enthusiasts&quot;. I seriously doubt Bob Gilmore has an intonational ax(e)<br/>&gt; to grind.</p><p>Of course not, but I was pointing out the pervasiveness of this misunderstanding of Partch&apos;s concepts.</p><p>&gt; John C. said the point was &quot;opaque&quot;; you said the &quot;derivation&quot; was<br/>&gt; &quot;...clear&quot;. Your implication, with regard to Gilmore, was that it should be<br/>&gt; &quot;clear&quot; to everyone. That was all I was referring to.</p><p>Ahem. John said Helmholtz&apos;s curves were opaque. I did not disagree. I said Partch&apos;s curves were clear. John agreed. And none of this has anything to do with Gilmore.</p><p>-Paul Erlich</p></div>
