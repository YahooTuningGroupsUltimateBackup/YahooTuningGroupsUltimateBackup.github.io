An ET, or a row, or a fixed pitch scale, or<br/>motif, or restricted palette in painting can all be mechanisms to<br/>help the artist make the &apos;next choice&apos; come from a finite set, and<br/>also facilitate making the rational of that choice understandable<br/>to an audience member.</p><p>Referring to serialism, part of the problem is that in many pieces,<br/>despite the limited palette of materials, the materials and variations<br/>are still &quot;too abstract&quot; to hear. Bergs Violin Concerto is the obvious<br/>counter-example where the rows clarity makes the piece listenable by<br/>an average audience (able to listen to other &quot;accepted&quot; twentieth<br/>century music). Babbitt too has some pieces where extreme &quot;micro<br/>micro motifs&quot; are quite comprehendable as music and not &quot;number<br/>games&quot;.</p><p>Please watch the amount of qouted material people especially responders<br/>to the digest.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=2975 href="#2975">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/1999 12:49:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I find it ironic that in this tuning list we hear mentioned composers such<br/>a Shoenberg,  and Babbitt all the time and an omission of composers who<br/>understood what at least 12 et did well. How about Britten or Copland and<br/>even Stravinsky.
