She can tolerate most of the rest of<br/>our taste, but is decidedly uncertain about Xenakis and some of the<br/>other electoacoustics.  She likes one of my pieces which had a lot of<br/>high freqiency sounds -- unfortunately I did not and junked it.</p><p>On the other hand I have not noticed any consonance/dissonance<br/>preferences; perhaps I will watch more carefully.</p><p>==John ff</p></div>
