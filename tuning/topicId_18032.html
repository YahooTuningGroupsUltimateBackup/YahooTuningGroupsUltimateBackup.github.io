How were they done again??</p><p>Started with the agogo, which I chose as it sounds like it has<br/>good inharmonic partials.</p><p>Then transposed it by 1/1 2/1 3/1,... 24/1, and played all the notes<br/>simultaneously.</p><p>For the subharmonics: 1/1 1/2 1/3,...</p><p>To do it in FTS, I made a custom voice:<br/>Voice | Custom voices | Edit Custom Melod. voices.</p><p>Then: Copy custom voice,<br/>Name it as whatever you like,<br/>Remove all except one of its instruments, and copy that<br/>one 24 times.</p><p>Then you have to set the Tr. by any interval box to show<br/>the transpositions you want for each instrument,<br/>so you highlight each instrument in turn, and change this<br/>to 1/1 2/1 3/1 etc.</p><p>Or it can be faster at that point to save to a .ts file,<br/>then edit the ts file and look for lines like this:</p><p>CustomVoice 0<br/>szDescr Agogo harmonics to 10<br/>nInst 24<br/>iInst 0 ipatch 113<br/>iInst 1 ipatch 113 dExtraShift 2/1<br/>iInst 2 ipatch 113 dExtraShift 3/1<br/>iInst 3 ipatch 113 dExtraShift 4/1<br/>iInst 4 ipatch 113 dExtraShift 5/1</p><p>To change the transpositions, edit the ratios at the end.</p><p>You can use ratio notation, or decimal point (1.25 = 5/4 etc)<br/>or to use cents here, use the notation &apos;100 = 100 cents<br/>(as FTS doesn&apos;t parse for the word cents when reading<br/>from the ts file)</p><p>If you then want to try it out with another patch, e.g.<br/>melodic tom, do search and replace, and change the<br/>113 to 117 everywhere.<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/melodic_tom_cv.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/melodic_tom_cv.mid</a></p><p>Or for the Glockenspiel, change it to 9, and so on.<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/glockenspiel_cv.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/glockenspiel_cv.mid</a></p><p>I&apos;ve uploaded a .ts file -

not sure why<br/>- as usually what happens is the new note switches off all the notes in<br/>the oldest updated channel - I&apos;ll see what can be done about that.</p><p>Also if you hold down a chord with many simultaneous notes, FTS has<br/>so many notes to play, can get interesting delayed play back effect of all<br/>the partials<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/ac_gr_p_cv_delayed_partials2.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/ac_gr_p_cv_delayed_partials2.mid</a><br/>(uses acoustic grand piano, which I use here for its thunder like timbre.)<br/>)<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/glockenspiel_cv.ts">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/glockenspiel_cv.ts</a><br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/glockenspiel_cv.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/glockenspiel_cv.mid</a></p><p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/melodic_tom_cv.ts">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/melodic_tom_cv.ts</a><br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/melodic_tom_cv.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/melodic_tom_cv.mid</a></p><p>(with the melodic tom patch,it is rather fun to just hit part of the<br/>keyboard with your fist, sounding many notes at once -
