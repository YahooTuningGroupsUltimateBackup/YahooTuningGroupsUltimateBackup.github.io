Can anyone say, &quot;digest mode?&quot;</p><p>&gt; Sethares said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Theres two interacting issues here - how to (re)tune<br/>&gt; the strings and how the frets are placed.<br/>&gt; What kinds of solutions have people come up with,<br/>&gt; either in wood or thought?</p><p>There are 2 official JI systems that have frets going straight across the<br/>neck and incorporate JI ratios.  LucyTuning, which I have never tried, and<br/>12-Tone-Plus which I have tried, and found to be very nice, giving you some<br/>7-limit ratios in addition to the 12tet frets.  Each system carries it&apos;s own<br/>usage fee.</p><p>LucyTuning:<br/><a href="http://lehua.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/frets.html">http://lehua.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/frets.html</a></p><p>12-Tone Plus:<br/><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~freenote/gtr01.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~freenote/gtr01.htm</a><br/>and<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson/guitars#12tp">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson/guitars#12tp</a></p><p>Some additional brain-storming:</p><p>Sitars have 2-3 playing strings and multiple drone strings.  No reason you<br/>couldn&apos;t play your guitar the same way, or even tune 4 strings to act as<br/>drones, and have the other 2 strings an octave apart.  Just intonation<br/>without the staggered frets!  Sitars also have the Sa (or Do in western<br/>solfege) about a fourth above the open note of the highest string.  That way<br/>you can get the leading tones below it without switching strings.</p><p>&gt;    From: Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:caccola@net1plus.com">caccola@net1plus.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone had any experience with the TransTrem bridges?<br/>&gt; Supposedly they<br/>&gt; can transpose and lock into place, though it would seem that a certain<br/>&gt; amount of set-up be done to determine the destination of the<br/>&gt; transposition.<br/>&gt; If it actually works, this might be one solution for a<br/>&gt; simpler fretting<br/>&gt; arrangement (at least fewer frets...).</p><p>It changes the pitch of all the strings by the same amount, so you can bend<br/>your open E chord into an open F, something not possible with a regular<br/>tremolo (the different strings bend different amounts).  Also it has stops<br/>at every half-step of bending up or down, about 5-7 stops in all.  How were<br/>you planning to use this?  Would you file microtonal stops to bend your open<br/>E chord to an E+20cents chord?  There&apos;s potential here in that you could<br/>modulate your tuning system by using the whammy bar to give a different tone<br/>set.  You are limited by the points where the strings go slack or break.<br/>About a minor third up or down.</p><p>&gt; Another equally unresearched idea is along the lines of<br/>&gt; moveable bridges: my<br/>&gt; 19tET chittarone will have two frets near the bridge so that<br/>&gt; the 7 long bass<br/>&gt; strings can cover the temperament.</p><p>With moveable bridges, you can approximate other equal temperaments pretty<br/>well, but it&apos;s not exact.  Unless of course you are talking about harp<br/>strings...</p><p>Please explain.  How close to the bridge are these 2 frets?  Which hand do<br/>you finger them with or do they mechanically touch the strings?  I hate to<br/>admit it, but I don&apos;t know what a chittarone is.  Did you spell it<br/>correctly?  Could you post a link to a picture so we all know what you are<br/>talking about?</p><p>&gt; from: Kraig<br/>&gt;     Both Rod Poole and myself found it worthwhile to tune up<br/>&gt; my Centaur<br/>&gt; tuning on guitar starting on the 7/4.

Half man, half horse in mythology.<br/>Pictures?</p><p>&gt; from: dante<br/>&gt; Another idea would be to use a scale from the harmonic<br/>&gt; series, maybe 16-32?<br/>&gt; You can also fret the neck to JI divisions and leave the string tuning<br/>&gt; variable- in fact isn&apos;t there a picture of a neck like this<br/>&gt; on Glen&apos;s site?<br/>&gt; I wonder what ratios he used?</p><p>I think you are referring to the last picture on that page, the Just<br/>Multi-Tonic.<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson/guitars/index.html#rentals">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson/guitars/index.html#rentals</a></p><p>Not harmonic series exactly, I started with all permutations of small whole<br/>number ratios up to the odd-limit: 9.  Then all their inversions, and added<br/>a few fourths up or down from other notes to fill out the gaps at the ends<br/>of the scale.  (since the guitar is usually tuned in fourths).

I&apos;ve used some slide tunings, and<br/>standard tuning.</p><p>&gt; from dante again:<br/>&gt; What kind of tolerances are possible, even with the best<br/>&gt; craftsmanship? (I&apos;m<br/>&gt; sure Glen&apos;s craftsmanship is on this level) I imagine it<br/>&gt; involves several<br/>&gt; different materials that have different reactions to<br/>&gt; heat/humidity over<br/>&gt; time, especially since they&apos;re not firmly attached to each other, so I<br/>&gt; wonder how this will effect the tuning accuracy?</p><p>Thank you for the compliment.

Other than equally spaced frets to give a subharmonic series<br/>(this is an arithmetic somethingorother).  If Catler&apos;s got something to<br/>work, try it.  It has to be complicated, to get all the notes you need<br/>out.  My belief is that a guitar isn&apos;t a natural JI instrument.  It isn&apos;t<br/>that easy to tune it accurately, it isn&apos;t at all easy to play when the<br/>frets get close together.  Ditto schismic temperament.</p><p>&gt; Theres two interacting issues here - how to (re)tune<br/>&gt; the strings and how the frets are placed.<br/>&gt; What kinds of solutions have people come up with,<br/>&gt; either in wood or thought?</p><p>Okay!  In wood, I have a 19/20 note per octave meantone fretting.  I&apos;m<br/>generally happy with this.  It&apos;s harder to play than the conventional<br/>fretting, but does sound better and work with a lot of existing music.<br/>Tuning is simple: same note names, switch to meantone tuning.  I&apos;ve also<br/>played with alternative string tunings and a capo to get neutral-third<br/>scales, but have no conclusive results to report.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/instrum.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/instrum.htm</a> for the details.  If I were<br/>doing it again, I might leave out the &quot;bonus fret&quot; or even go for only 17<br/>frets to the octave.  That extra fret makes it harder to play, and<br/>conventional music never needs it.  The natural C7 chord that uses it<br/>doesn&apos;t sound that good.</p><p>If I could have multiple fretboards, my shopping list would be:</p><p>The fretting I use now, but tuned to 31-equal for the difference it&apos;d<br/>make.  Also, the variations I suggest above.</p><p>Some more fifth-oriented meantone (say 43-equal) with fewer frets, say 12<br/>to the octave but still doubled near the nut because I do need both, and<br/>they&apos;re widely spaced up there.  This means the open string could be<br/>raised by both a chromatic and diatonic semitone, if that makes it<br/>clearer.</p><p>12, 19, 22, 24 and 31-equal.  Maybe 17 and 7 as well.  And 10, 15, ...<br/>depending on the budget.  BTW, a 10-equal fretting could be tuned to<br/>50-equal.  Interesting, but not completely viable.</p><p>The equivalent of 24 equally spaced frets across the board.  This would<br/>mean 12 equally spaced frets to the octave plus however may fit on with<br/>the same spacing towards the bridge.  Maybe other frettings like this, but<br/>I&apos;d have to work them out.  Things like LucyTuning and golden meantone to<br/>however many frets I think would work.</p><p>(Oh, I found it useful to get a printout of the fret positions as I was<br/>thinking about that guitar.  So I could get an idea for where my fingers<br/>would go.  This wouldn&apos;t be as critical for interchangable fingerboards as<br/>the investment per tuning is less.)</p><p>A dedicated fretting to work with neutral-third scales.  Probably tuned to<br/>31-equal.</p><p>I hope you find that helpful!  As a mathematically-oriented tuning geek, I<br/>feel duty bound to answer that violin question, to show I&apos;m not only<br/>interested in numbers.  I really haven&apos;t got a clue, though.  Does it<br/>really make much difference, as the board is fretless?</p><p>Oh yes, I&apos;d have a fretless fingerboard for my guitar as well.</p><p>Some kind of neutral-third tuning would be nice, but the question<br/>(wherever it was) did say JI.</p><p>  Warm and friendly regards to the whole tuning community,</p><p>            Graham</p></div><h3><a id=5334 href="#5334">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;caccola@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/1999 4:55:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Glen,</p><p>Right - I spelled it wrong: chitarrone.

In the second octave, you could choose the more<br/>consonant ratio for each pair of frets or substitute a meantone fret halfway<br/>between the two.  Alternately, have a fret for the lower note, and bend up<br/>to the higher one when you need it.  There&apos;s a lot of bending in sitar<br/>music, and not that many frets.

Alternately, have a fret for the lower note, and bend up<br/>&gt;to the higher one when you need it.</p><p>Choosing one (often the more consonant against a 1/1-3/2 drone) ratio for each<br/>pair of frets corresponds to the solution called the &quot;Modern Indian Gamut&quot; as I<br/>understand it, which I believe I&apos;ve heard used by santoor (hammer-dulcimer)<br/>players:<br/>1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 27/16 9/5 15/8 2/1.</p><p>Fleshing out your last suggestion:<br/>If you place the frets at what is essentially a 12-tone Pythagorean scale with<br/>schismatic (~2 cent) alterations:<br/>1/1 256/243 10/9 32/27 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 128/81 5/3 16/9 15/8 2/1<br/>which (ignoring the schisma) can be notated as the standard 12-tone Pythagorean<br/>tuning, starting on C#:<br/>C# D Eb E F F# G G# A Bb B C C#<br/>(coincidence: the Indian drone is often near C#)<br/>then the notes of the Modern Indian Gamut would all be reachable by a bend (you<br/>can only bend upwards) of no more than a comma. Those Pythagorean notes plus the<br/>MIG notes give you 18 srutis; the other 4, 81/64, 27/20, 729/512 (~=64/45), and<br/>243/128 can also be played with a bend of no more than a comma.</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s a lot of bending in sitar<br/>&gt;music, and not that many frets.

More recently (fewer years<br/>ago), I bought a Martin 00016 steel-string guitar and an<br/>interchangeable fingerboard kit from Mark Rankin, and hired a luthier<br/>to make the modifications and the fingerboard blanks including a<br/>standard (12-tone equal tempered) fingerboard. After some thought,<br/>I fretted one fingerboard based on the idea of blues in A, using a<br/>7-limit scale. Lately, I&apos;m considering fretting another fingerboard to<br/>get harmonic scales (8-16) on E and A.</p><p>Here are some issues that arose:</p><p>* How close can frets be?</p><p>On my Giannini, I chose frets straight across, and lots of &apos;em (37 in<br/>the first octave). All the frets are playable. The closest frets are 4mm<br/>apart, center to center, and the frets themselves are 2mm wide, so<br/>the gap is a fret-width. With frets this close, one needs to be very<br/>careful to get the fret heights uniform to insure playability and no buzz.<br/>In my experience, fret separations of 6mm or more are relatively easy<br/>to play. (The closest frets on my Martin fingerboard are 5mm, but the<br/>upper note is not in the scale; see below.)</p><p>Of course, to play such frets requires precise finger placement, but no<br/>extra pressure is required. Naturally, wider fret spacing makes for<br/>easier playing, particularly when trying to play chords. Barred chords<br/>with staggered frets can be tricky.</p><p>* Extra frets just above others are not a problem</p><p>In some cases on the Martin fingerboard, it was easiest to use a full<br/>fret where the scale would call for a partial fret with a gap. Provided<br/>this extra fret was just above (sharp) of the scale fret, the extra fret<br/>did not get in the way. For example, the 3/2 fret gives a 27/16 on the<br/>B (9/8) string, just (a comma) above the fret for 5/3. The extra<br/>(27/16) fret does not make the usual fret (5/3) any harder to play,<br/>and because it is so close, it hardly reduces the space to the fret<br/>above (7/4), so that one is really no harder to play either.</p><p>This led me to the realization that an &quot;alternate&quot; note will not get in the<br/>way provided it is a comma sharp of a &quot;standard&quot; note in the scale.<br/>The alternate itself will be harder to play, but the rest of the scale<br/>won&apos;t. (Unfortunately for my blues fingerboard, the alternate D is<br/>21/16, which is below the standard D 4/3, so playing the standard D<br/>4/3 requires particular attention.) I plan to take advantage of this in<br/>future fingerboards, to throw in a few extra (sharp) notes that I can<br/>get when I really want them.</p><p>* The open strings don&apos;t have to be tuned to the scale</p><p>I am pretty slow about tuning the strings, in part because I am very<br/>particular about getting it as right as I can, to my ear. (I tune by<br/>harmonics, and it works very well for me. Even when I tune<br/>tempered, I do it based on beats in the harmonics.) In contrast,<br/>changing fingerboards is pretty quick and easy. So for me, the idea of<br/>using one tuning for more than one fingerboard seems attractive.</p><p>But a natural approach is to tune the strings to the scale. For those<br/>that do a lot with open strings, this makes good sense. (I&apos;m not a very<br/>good guitarist, but I like to play melodies all over the neck and don&apos;t<br/>always use open strings.) Of course, the choices of scale and string<br/>tuning determine fret positions, which affects the playability (and<br/>navigability too!).</p><p>For my first interchangeable fingerboard, I used standard EADGBE<br/>tuning, but all pure fourths (3/2 1/1 4/3 16/9 9/8 3/2, to A440), even<br/>though the G in the scale is 7/4, not 16/9. This means I can never<br/>play an open G with a fretted G (unless I&apos;m into ugly). But had I<br/>instead chosen an open G 7/4, the frets on the G string would all have<br/>to go up a bit, resulting in many more partial frets for just the one<br/>string. Not only would the fingerboard be harder to make, but a bit<br/>harder to play as well. Having all my open fourths perfect makes the<br/>frets simpler, and when they go straight across several strings I know<br/>those fourths are perfect too, which helps in understanding which<br/>frets are which in the scale. (I may use the same tuning for my next<br/>fingerboard as well, for harmonic scales 8-16.)</p><p>Using &quot;dofrets.eps&quot; to visualize the frets helps in exploring the<br/>possibilities...</p><p>David Canright                <a href="http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/">http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/</a></p></div><h3><a id=5425 href="#5425">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

According to Steve Vai, Buzz Feiten&apos;s system<br/>&gt; involves a separate nut, bridge, and tuning adjustment for<br/>&gt; each string.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard samples and it does help.  I also understand why people don&apos;t do<br/>it more often.  You have to adjust the intonation at the saddle to<br/>compensate for the nut, and vice/versa.  Then if the string height changes<br/>at the nut or saddle, you have to do it all over again.  Heaven forbid you<br/>should ever want to use a different gauge or brand of strings!</p><p>There are so many other reasons guitars don&apos;t play in tune: strings<br/>stretching, sticky nut slots, humidity or temperature changes, careless<br/>tuning, heavy picking, heavy fretting, just to name a few.  For these<br/>reasons, I haven&apos;t done much nut compensation in the past, but you are<br/>inspiring me to do some experiments, come up with measurements, and maybe<br/>make nut compensation (or at least partial compensation for average strings)<br/>a standard feature.</p><p>&gt;    From: John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;A zero fret is a fret placed where the nut would<br/>&gt; normally be...<br/>&gt; &#x9;With a system like this (I believe some<br/>&gt; Rickenbacker guitars used a zero fret...Glen?)</p><p>Yes some Rickenbackers, a bunch of cheap instruments (probably why the zero<br/>fret is frowned upon in many circles), and even some really nice Gretch<br/>guitars all have zero frets.</p><p>&gt; With perfect relief<br/>&gt; profile, we expect the increase in pitch to be greatest at<br/>&gt; the octave</p><p>I&apos;ve never heard a luthier talk about relief vs tuning.

Several sets of the same classical strings - they were all<br/>&gt; Augustine Blue - gave different results at every measurement.</p><p>Using multiple sets of strings gives credibility to his results.  This is<br/>great stuff!

Many people have emailed me about<br/>things like this.  Some even mentioned the crescent shaped frets.  If you<br/>can compensate at the nut and bridge, do you still need to compensate every<br/>fret?</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div>
