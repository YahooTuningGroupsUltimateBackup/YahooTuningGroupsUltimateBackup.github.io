However, it seems whenever there is<br/>&gt;a &quot;vote&quot; on this matter, the majority of people don&apos;t really want to<br/>&gt;move.  And then there is the question of all the &quot;sister&quot; lists,<br/>&gt;which people use quite a bit as well.</p><p>Speak for yourself, Joe.  Chris, you have my support today.  I&apos;ll<br/>switch as soon as the new list is available.</p><p>&gt;Moving 500 people is quite a task,</p><p>Have you looked at the &quot;500 people&quot; lately?</p><p>&gt;should &quot;sign up&quot; but my guess is that a lot of people would continue<br/>&gt;to use *this* list, so there would be, essentially, TWO lists, unless<br/>&gt;this one could be taken down... and then we lose the archive.</p><p>Whatever happens will happen.  One list will probably win -- and then<br/>at least we had a choice.  Or maybe there will be two lists, and if<br/>so it will be for a reason.</p><p>&gt;The archive feature is also something to consider.  We can easily<br/>&gt;*link* as it stands now.</p><p>I don&apos;t know the details of Chris&apos; setup, but it&apos;s clear he&apos;s serious.<br/>Joe, there&apos;s nothing special about yahoo&apos;s interface.  Please take the<br/>time to learn a little bit about this stuff.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2002 2:31:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36095">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36095</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know the details of Chris&apos; setup, but it&apos;s clear he&apos;s<br/>serious.<br/>&gt; Joe, there&apos;s nothing special about yahoo&apos;s interface.

I suppose people will *migrate* over to it, just<br/>like they have gone over to other lists from the &quot;main&quot; one.</p><p>So, sure, go ahead.  But, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if certain<br/>discussions still continue over *here..* so, essentially, there will<br/>be *two* main tuning lists, in addition to all the supplementary ones.</p><p>I guess that&apos;s not really a problem.  Maybe people will like the new<br/>one so much that they will just *stop* posting over here.  I guess<br/>it&apos;s possible.
