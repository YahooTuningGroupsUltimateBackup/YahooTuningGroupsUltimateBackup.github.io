I&apos;d say a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; good scale for producing a vaguely bluesy sound is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Orwell[9]; not that it&apos;s a blues scale, but all those<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7/6s give it a sort of blue note feel. Isn&apos;t that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what you need for blues--a few blue notes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Blues is founded essentially on the minor pentatonic scale<br/>&gt; -- to take the simplest example: A C D E G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just try a little improvising with that scale, making sure<br/>&gt; that you keep the tonic on A, and not C or another note,<br/>&gt; and what you play will probably already sound quite bluesy,<br/>&gt; even in 12-edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The way blues guitartists play the blues, they basically<br/>&gt; fret those 5 notes, and then apply strategic pitch-bending<br/>&gt; wherever they feel that it belongs, most usually bending<br/>&gt; up the minor-3rd and the 4th ... and remember that on the<br/>&gt; guitar, the bending only goes in one direction: up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the blues was originally (back in the late 1800s)<br/>&gt; a strictly vocal music, so the guitar style evolved<br/>&gt; after the manner of the vocals, which we know is free<br/>&gt; to roam wherever the singer wants it to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A blues scale typically played by keyboard players<br/>&gt; would be: A C D D#/Eb E G G#/Ab. Those chromatic notes<br/>&gt; are simply an analgoue of what the guitarists do,<br/>&gt; since you can&apos;t bend notes on a regular piano.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I play 7/6, which raises a few eyebrows but is generally<br/>&gt; &gt; accepted.  Monz found 19/16 used as a blue note. But the<br/>&gt; &gt; general definition in practically all the literature<br/>&gt; &gt; (I don&apos;t know any exceptions) speaks about neutral thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; and sevenths. Guitarists play it like that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve asked before and do it again: Who brought up the<br/>&gt; &gt; notion that blue notes are septimal intervals, or are<br/>&gt; &gt; extra low thirds?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m certain that the idea that blue notes are septimal<br/>&gt; ratios comes from the fact that in the blues, *every*<br/>&gt; chord is a dominant-7th chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is fundamentally different from Euro-style<br/>&gt; &quot;common-practice&quot; usage, where the dominant-7th chord<br/>&gt; is a dissonance which must be resolved, and typically<br/>&gt; only appears as the &quot;dominant&quot; (V), with the root of<br/>&gt; the chord on the 5th degree of the diatonic scale ...<br/>&gt; or it functions exactly like that in cases where a<br/>&gt; different chord has chromatic substitutions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In blues this is not the case. *Every* chord is a<br/>&gt; dominant-7th chord, and none of them set up the kind<br/>&gt; of tension--&gt;resolution expectation as they do in<br/>&gt; Euro-style music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus, in blues the dominant-7th chord is the funadamental<br/>&gt; consonance. This IMO encourages the listener&apos;s ears to<br/>&gt; interpret *every* chord as a 4:5:6:7 proportion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So let&apos;s say we have a vocalist or guitarist jamming<br/>&gt; away on the A C D E G pentatonic scale with pitch-bends.<br/>&gt; The chords which go with that scale in the blues<br/>&gt; typically follow the 12-measure progression:<br/>&gt; A7 / / / D7 / A7 / E7 D7 A7 E7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the listener&apos;s ear is already hearing the melodic G<br/>&gt; as a 7/4 above A, the melodic C as a 7/4 above D, and<br/>&gt; the melodic D as a 7/4 above E, and with all the bending<br/>&gt; going on, the guitarist and vocalist may indeed be<br/>&gt; *playing* those notes lower in pitch so that they<br/>&gt; really *are* septimal intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the D is approximately a 4/3 above the tonic A, and<br/>&gt; the C is approximately a 7/4 above the D, then when the<br/>&gt; A7 comes back around, that C will be heard as a 7/6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that&apos;s my theory on why theorists persist in claiming<br/>&gt; that septimal intervals are important to the blues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course the real situation is much more complicated<br/>&gt; than that. Old-school (i.e., Delta) blues musicians<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t know anything about Western music-theory, and<br/>&gt; played and sang whatever damn notes they felt. For an<br/>&gt; example of the richness of notes available to them, see:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tonic of this piece is D. The scale Johnson used<br/>&gt; in his vocals in this song is interesting in that,<br/>&gt; if you try to describe it in terms of 12-edo or meantone,<br/>&gt; you basically get: D F# G G#/Ab A A#/Bb B C C#.<br/>&gt; So it&apos;s essentially a chromatic scale, but with a<br/>&gt; big gap between the D and F#. But it could still,<br/>&gt; with less accuracy, be notated and performed simply<br/>&gt; with D F G A C, and it wouldn&apos;t really sound &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And keep in mind that this tune is one of Robert Johnson&apos;s<br/>&gt; *simplest* performances. Given all the time i spent on<br/>&gt; analyzing this, i wish i had done _Hellhound On My Trail_<br/>&gt; instead, which is mind-boggling in its pitch complexity,<br/>&gt; considering that it&apos;s just one guy playing a guitar and<br/>&gt; singing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software</p><p>In this one post, I think you&apos;ve managed to convey an<br/>excellent potted history of the blues and its realisations<br/>on some major instruments.  It would form a good back-<br/>bone for an encyclopaedia article on the blues.  More<br/>particularly, as it references your instructive analysis of<br/>Robert Johnson&apos;s &quot;Drunken hearted man&quot;, it&apos;s very<br/>appropriate for a _microtonal_ encyclopaedia article.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.12.2/137 - Release Date: 16/10/05</p></div>
