Wilson states that these other scale<br/>layouts are all implied in his logic. It is interesting how one scale can be mapped over quite<br/>a few different layouts. Those pictured are biased to Pelog being thought of as a chain of<br/>Minor thirds (about 7/6) This layout makes the major scales found in this tuning harder to<br/>play where as the others make it easier, The reason for this is that if one improvises on this<br/>keyboard, it forces the player away from old territories and into newer ones. I hope to place<br/>all the keyboards available for the 22 tone 1-3-7-9-11-15 Eikosany. These keyboard layout are<br/>also usable for Erlich 22 Et also. Soon! I am in the process of finishing a &quot;translation&quot; of<br/>an Anaphorian Shadow Play to be performed at next years Microfest</p><p>&gt;  Also, do the Anaphorians use the Wilson Bosanquet<br/>&gt; notation for their pieces??</p><p>yes and no! As this 22 tone scale is found within the full Dallesandro full CPS of the<br/>1-3-5-7-9-11, ( I know it doesn&apos;t seem like it would be but it is, in fact within Dallesandro<br/>are two of these former Eikosanies a 3/2 a part), nd these two instruments were used together<br/>at times the 22 is notated using the 31 tone notation for those notes. The idea of using two<br/>different notations seem to be out right confusing.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
