Have you ever felt a sense<br/>of doubt and uncertainty about something which you have known for<br/>years?  Well, that is what happened to me when I was writing about<br/>the similarity between Country music and some Indian Folk music, this<br/>morning.  You have cleared my doubt.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
