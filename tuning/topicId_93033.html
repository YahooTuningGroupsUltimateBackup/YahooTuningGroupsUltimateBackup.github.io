The strength of<br/>the pattern speaks for itself.</p><p>&gt; It appears that your hypothesis is based on two things: the harmonic series, and a &quot;depriming interval&quot; which is the absolute maximum of Harmonic Entropy, around 60-70 cents--perhaps around the size of a 5-limit chromatic semitone (25/24)?

I&apos;m not entirely sure that it&apos;s right, and<br/>have now modified it a bit to just think that it&apos;s a good rule of<br/>thumb to find maximally discordant intervals. This is just a<br/>conjecture, and it&apos;s a side thing. Don&apos;t get so hung up on this that<br/>the main point is missed.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Minorness&quot;, then, is sort of a point intermediately between &quot;major&quot; and &quot;painful&quot;?</p><p>Yes. This is, in essence, the hypothesis, irrespective of any<br/>particular psychoacoustic explanation. We&apos;ve been using this in common<br/>practice music for hundreds of years: minor is sadder than major, and<br/>diminished is sadder than minor. And with minor, minor7 is a bit less<br/>sad, and minor maj7 is more so. Chords like C-E-F#-B-D# in 12-tet and<br/>C-Eb-G are on some roughly similar level of &quot;pain.&quot; Or C-E-G-B-D-F#,<br/>perhaps. And if you continue the pattern up the harmonic series, it<br/>holds and leads to new xenharmonic &quot;minor&quot; chords that to my ears,<br/>continue the &quot;minor&quot; pattern more than the otonal/utonal thing does.<br/>Note that utonalness has no specific psychoacoustic explanation, and<br/>coincides with detunings of the harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; I really don&apos;t get how this theory deals with chord formed by higher chunks of the harmonic series. Are you suggesting that chords like 10:12:15 or 6:7:9 are really heard as just &quot;deprimed&quot; versions of 4:5:6? I&apos;d think you sort of *have to* say this for it to make sense, or else 6:7:9 should sound &quot;major&quot;, and then its &quot;deprimed&quot; version (which would be close to 8:9:12) should sound more minor.</p><p>I&apos;m saying that if you actively TRY to find the most discordant<br/>sonority that emerges when you sharpen the 5 in 4:5:6, it ends up<br/>being somewhere near 10:12:15, or maybe 0-333-702. Go past this and it<br/>gets less discordant. Discordance corresponds to perceptual &quot;pain.&quot; If<br/>you try to sharpen the 5, the most discordant sonority emerges<br/>somewhere around where the third is 7:9, and gets less discordant at<br/>10:13:15. Note that 10:13:15 and 6:7:9 are of a roughly similar<br/>quality, and that 0-333-702 and 14:18:21 are as well.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll be damned if I can hear a sus2 chord as &quot;more minor&quot; than a subminor chord. So how exactly *does* your theory deal with triads formed of higher harmonics, or triads where the &quot;deprimed&quot; version is still close to the harmonic series?</p><p>You probably don&apos;t hear subminor as more painful than minor either, or<br/>a supermajor chord where the major third is 13/10 as more painful than<br/>one where it&apos;s 9/7. Note that these also correspond to lower integer<br/>ratios; 6:7:9 is lower than 10:12:15, and 10:13:15 is lower than<br/>14:18:21. Moving an interval by 60-70 cents is a &quot;rough guideline&quot; to<br/>find intervals that are maximally discordant from these. The &quot;truest&quot;<br/>minor chord, in a sense, is one in which you screw with that minor<br/>third to get it to sound as &quot;biting&quot; as possible. Then you can adjust<br/>it, if you want, to something like 6/5, so it&apos;s beatless.</p><p>Perhaps a better generalization would be the &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; approach,<br/>but generalized somehow to harmonies without dyads.</p><p>That&apos;s why I modified the hypothesis. The &quot;depriming&quot; interval is just<br/>sort of a rule of thumb to find maximally discordant intervals nearby.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you feel there is a better explanation, please give<br/>it. Maybe it just boils down to the harmonic entropy of a tetrad.<br/>However, not only does the pattern work, and not only does it explain<br/>all of the 12-tet chords I&apos;ve ever played, but it&apos;s giving me a<br/>fascinating new perspective with which to view 13-tet, and a way to<br/>generalize tonality to other sections of the overtone series which I<br/>think will yield good results. If you don&apos;t hear it the same way, then<br/>alright... I&apos;ll view that as an interesting data point and assume that<br/>perhaps I&apos;ve just found a general pattern I&apos;ve &quot;learned&quot; to hear as<br/>sad or painful. So far, most of my friends have heard the &quot;series of<br/>negativity&quot; in my example as increasingly negative though, so I hope<br/>the lack of interest here is just in that my initial psychoacoustic<br/>conjecture put people off in being perhaps somewhat simplistic.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93035 href="#93035">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2010 5:57:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Sep 19, 2010 at 8:49 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Sun, Sep 19, 2010 at 6:50 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&gt;&gt; It appears that your hypothesis is based on two things: the harmonic series, and a &quot;depriming interval&quot; which is the absolute maximum of Harmonic Entropy, around 60-70 cents--perhaps around the size of a 5-limit chromatic semitone (25/24)?

So<br/>there would be an additional set of &quot;maximally discordant&quot; intervals<br/>that would be generated from the existing set of concordant ones.</p><p>Here&apos;s how such a function could be defined, and what I&apos;m currently working on:</p><p>Harmonic entropy first matches an incoming to the set of all dyads,<br/>generated with a Tenney series, then makes an entropy calculation. A<br/>more elegant way to do this, perhaps, would be to come up with a<br/>transform that treats the dyad or triad or any-ad as a signal, and<br/>represents it with a set of non-orthogonal basis functions (with the<br/>Fourier transform as an orthogonal subset) which have the frequency<br/>response of a damped sinusoid with its frequency as a parameter, its<br/>damping coefficient as a parameter, AND a set of harmonics with<br/>rolloff as third parameter. If you get rid of the last argument, you<br/>have the Laplace transform (if you use complex exponentials instead of<br/>sinusoids). So the addition of the last argument would, effectively,<br/>extend the Laplace transform into a three-dimensional space, in which<br/>the additional dimension represents the presence of harmonics with a<br/>rolloff that increases along each side of the axis. Seems I should<br/>call it the &quot;Harmonic Laplace Transform,&quot; which is a name I just made<br/>up, so HLT from now on. There&apos;s probably a clever way to get the<br/>computation of this down to nlog(n) time or something.</p><p>So now I pick some rolloff r that corresponds to the human<br/>neurological auditory filter, and a damping coefficient d that spreads<br/>the cone of uncertainty of each harmonic to about 300 Hz (the width of<br/>a critical band), and hence we will obtain the set of all basis<br/>vectors that &quot;match&quot; the signal, and how much. Use this as the basis<br/>for an entropy calculation (for any amount of notes, with any timbre,<br/>for a time-varying signal if you want), and profit. Then, the &quot;#&quot; and<br/>&quot;b&quot; operators in JI can be rigorously defined as the local maximum of<br/>entropy nearby the detuning of a note sharp or flat, either with sines<br/>or for some standard &quot;reference timbre&quot; if we prefer.</p><p>That&apos;s a bit more mathematically rigorous; hopefully you can see how<br/>this fits into the abstract topology that you have going on with<br/>regular temperament. Although you&apos;re a math Ph.D, I don&apos;t know how<br/>much you had to delve into the specifics of things like the Laplace<br/>transform (I remember you asking some questions about it), so I can go<br/>more into the exact formulation of the transform and how I propose to<br/>extend it, if you want.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93047 href="#93047">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2010 11:02:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Sep 20, 2010 at 1:32 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonic entropy first matches an incoming to the set of all dyads,<br/>&gt; generated with a Tenney series, then makes an entropy calculation.

Still, if my experience of that chord suggests anything, it&apos;s that harmony gets more painful the more complex it is, so by your theory a 4:5:6 chord would be more major than a 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 chord.  I can definitely agree to that.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m saying that if you actively TRY to find the most discordant<br/>&gt; sonority that emerges when you sharpen the 5 in 4:5:6, it ends up<br/>&gt; being somewhere near 10:12:15, or maybe 0-333-702. Go past this and it<br/>&gt; gets less discordant. Discordance corresponds to perceptual &quot;pain.&quot; If<br/>&gt; you try to sharpen the 5, the most discordant sonority emerges<br/>&gt; somewhere around where the third is 7:9, and gets less discordant at<br/>&gt; 10:13:15. Note that 10:13:15 and 6:7:9 are of a roughly similar<br/>&gt; quality, and that 0-333-702 and 14:18:21 are as well.</p><p>After doing some listening tests, where I used sawtooth, piano, and/or guitar patches, I can conclusively say that 10:13:15 is more discordant to my ears than 14:18:21.  I am powerless to explain why this might be, except to hypothesize that it&apos;s because the component dyads are simpler in the 14:18:21.  10:13:15 sounds less &quot;major&quot; to me.  But from your hypothesis, this makes sense, because 387+60=447, which is closer to 10:13 than it is to 7:9.  However, I can also say that if you subtract 60 cents from 387, you get 327, whereas I hear the maximum of discordance closer to 347.  347 hurts, man.  It practically draws blood compared to 387, but 333 or 327 just gives a slight bruise.  Unsurprisingly, this is in line with H.E.</p><p>&gt; You probably don&apos;t hear subminor as more painful than minor either, or<br/>&gt; a supermajor chord where the major third is 13/10 as more painful than<br/>&gt; one where it&apos;s 9/7. Note that these also correspond to lower integer<br/>&gt; ratios; 6:7:9 is lower than 10:12:15, and 10:13:15 is lower than<br/>&gt; 14:18:21. Moving an interval by 60-70 cents is a &quot;rough guideline&quot; to<br/>&gt; find intervals that are maximally discordant from these. The &quot;truest&quot;<br/>&gt; minor chord, in a sense, is one in which you screw with that minor<br/>&gt; third to get it to sound as &quot;biting&quot; as possible. Then you can adjust<br/>&gt; it, if you want, to something like 6/5, so it&apos;s beatless.</p><p>Well, you&apos;re wrong about my perception of the 13/10 vs. 9/7, but right about the subminor.  6:7:9 is decidedly less painful than 10:12:15 or 14:17:21.  But it&apos;s also less painful than 26:30:39, which has a 15/13 subminor third.  So in some ways, the dyadic H.E. curve holds, but in other ways, it doesn&apos;t, since the chord with the 6/5 is more painful than the chord with the 7/6.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps a better generalization would be the &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; approach,<br/>&gt; but generalized somehow to harmonies without dyads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s why I modified the hypothesis. The &quot;depriming&quot; interval is just<br/>&gt; sort of a rule of thumb to find maximally discordant intervals nearby.</p><p>If you used noble mediants, wouldn&apos;t the depriming interval vary depending on which two dyads you were looking at?  And wouldn&apos;t the results come out looking just like H.E.?</p><p>&gt; Nonetheless, if you feel there is a better explanation, please give<br/>&gt; it. Maybe it just boils down to the harmonic entropy of a tetrad.<br/>&gt; However, not only does the pattern work, and not only does it explain<br/>&gt; all of the 12-tet chords I&apos;ve ever played, but it&apos;s giving me a<br/>&gt; fascinating new perspective with which to view 13-tet, and a way to<br/>&gt; generalize tonality to other sections of the overtone series which I<br/>&gt; think will yield good results. If you don&apos;t hear it the same way, then<br/>&gt; alright... I&apos;ll view that as an interesting data point and assume that<br/>&gt; perhaps I&apos;ve just found a general pattern I&apos;ve &quot;learned&quot; to hear as<br/>&gt; sad or painful. So far, most of my friends have heard the &quot;series of<br/>&gt; negativity&quot; in my example as increasingly negative though, so I hope<br/>&gt; the lack of interest here is just in that my initial psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; conjecture put people off in being perhaps somewhat simplistic.</p><p>Maybe you should stick to comparing triads for now, since (IMHO) adding more unique notes to a chord always increases the pain.  Do these predictions hold for triads that span intervals other than a 3/2?  What about an 8:9:12?</p><p>At any rate, I&apos;m at a loss to come up with a real hypothesis about feelings of minorness.  6:7:9 blows the &quot;otonal=major&quot; theory, 8:9:12 blows the &quot;lower than 5/4=minor&quot; theory, since I swear on my grandmother&apos;s grave that 8:9:12 sounds major to me.  9/8 is lower in pitch than 6/5, higher in pain than 7/6, and 8:9:12 has, to my knowledge, lower tonalness than 6:7:9.  I also wanted to believe that, given two triads with the same span, the one with the lower middle note will sound minor in comparison to the one with the higher middle note, but comparing 16:18:21 with its utonal counterpart--1:7/6:21/16--kills that.  I&apos;ll try to post an audio example tomorrow some time, but to me it&apos;s pretty obvious.</p></div><h3><a id=93051 href="#93051">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2010 11:42:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Sep 20, 2010 at 2:07 AM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So then &quot;major&quot; should be painless?

In fact,<br/>I&apos;m not saying anything new; we&apos;ve already known that diminished<br/>chords sound so dark because the flattened fifth is a discordant and<br/>less stable sonority than the perfect fifth. I simply generalized that<br/>all up and down the harmonic series, and found that when you alter the<br/>5 you get minor, when you alter 5 and 6 you get diminished, when you<br/>alter 5 and 7 and leave six alone, you get min/maj7 or min/maj6 (with<br/>a super sharp six), and that the pattern continues all the way up the<br/>overtone series to new xenharmonic ultra-minor chords. I think that<br/>this is significant, and although I note much has been made of the<br/>fact that 4:5:6:7 implies an even stronger VF than 4:5:6, I&apos;m not<br/>aware of much research on how small amounts of dissonance, introduced<br/>predictably into microtonal sonorities, influences the result.</p><p>I also noticed that sharpening the major third in small doses does the<br/>same thing, and can create sort of a feeling of sadness too, unless<br/>it&apos;s done too much, at which point it sounds awful, but then starts to<br/>become harmonic again as the 5/4 becomes 4/3.

Lower<br/>the 7, 9, and 11 slightly if you want, so as to avoid them poking out<br/>and being painful. Most importantly, note the feeling that is produced<br/>as you mix concordance and discordance.

I wrote a whole paragraph of my own hypothesis, then realized it had too many weak-points to be worth advancing at this point and deleted it.</p><p>&gt; 4:8:9:12 isn&apos;t higher in pain for me than 3:6:7:9.</p><p>Where did the 4th and 3rd harmonics come from?</p><p>&gt; 8:9:12 will have higher tonalness than 6:7:9, since octave<br/>&gt; generalization is such a strong habit these days. At least, the<br/>&gt; tonalness of 4:8:9:12 is higher than the tonalness of 3:6:7:9.</p><p>But I&apos;m not talking about 4:8:9:12 and 3:6:7:9.  I&apos;m talking about 8:9:12 and 6:7:9.  There&apos;s a difference.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I also wanted to believe that, given two triads with the same span, the one with the lower middle note will sound minor in comparison to the one with the higher middle note, but comparing 16:18:21 with its utonal counterpart--1:7/6:21/16--kills that. I&apos;ll try to post an audio example tomorrow some time, but to me it&apos;s pretty obvious.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s never what I said. In my last listening example, I gave out<br/>&gt; three examples of chords that should have roughly the same amount of<br/>&gt; &quot;pain,&quot; in a small enough dose that you might term it &quot;sadness,&quot; and<br/>&gt; only one was minor and the other two had a major third (one had a<br/>&gt; supermajor third).</p><p>I know it&apos;s never what you said.  Okay, here&apos;s the incomplete/flawed theory I almost posted, it has a couple of points:<br/>1: to be recognizable as major or minor, a triad must have a span within a certain range, maybe no narrower than 5/4 and no wider than 5/3 (I&apos;m wildly uncertain about this range).<br/>2: a triad will only be recognizable as major or minor in comparison with another triad of equal span (provided both are in the same inversion, and the middle notes are both in the same interval class according to one&apos;s internal map).<br/>3: of the pair of triads, the one with the lower middle note will sound minor, and the one with the higher middle note will sound major.</p><p>These criteria accurately describe almost all pairs of chords that I&apos;ve tried, but it breaks down when we look at sus2 chords, which I hear as more major than a minor chord.  However, it holds pretty much everywhere else, which is why I&apos;m so confounded.</p><p>&gt; Compare C Eb G to C E F# B D E B, in 12-tet, and tell me if you think<br/>&gt; they have similar amounts of sadness. If not, resolve that F# upward<br/>&gt; to G, and see if that resolution brings the pain a bit.</p><p>Ugh, I cannot compare these two.  It&apos;s like apples to screwdrivers.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=93093 href="#93093">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 2:09:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have the program notes to these files if anybody&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; interested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why don&apos;t you stick the notes in with the files?</p><p>Because I&apos;m not David Finnamore and I don&apos;t have admin<br/>access on harmonic_entropy.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
