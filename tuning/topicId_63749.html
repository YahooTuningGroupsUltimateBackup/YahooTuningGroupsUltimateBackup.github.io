Almost inevitable, they point to moments in the music when Partch is in fact out-of-tune, whether by choice (i.e the score calls for vertical combinations that are not simple diamond-diagonal consonances; Partch was very fond of what he called &quot;inharmonic&quot; tones and once percussion was added, his choice of pitches in practice became extremely free) or by circumstance (either the performance was bad or the recording was less than optimal).</p><p>About the negative response to 7-limit music -- do you have any sense of whether the response was due to the quality of the chords themselves, their sonance, or to their strangeness in terms of harmonic functions? Since a distinguishing quality of American vernacular musics is the use of 7th chords as consonances (available on any degree, all the time, no need to resolve) I suspect that it would be the former, but that&apos;s just a guess, and perhaps there are alternative explanations.</p><p>DJW</p><p>&gt;    From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: How do microtonal people hear?<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m wondering if there is something funny about the way most of us<br/>&gt; hear, which causes us to be able to listen to Harry Partch for the<br/>&gt; first time and immediately think it sounds cool. The reason I&apos;m<br/>&gt; pondering that is that I&apos;ve accumulated a lot of evidence that 7-limit<br/>&gt; just or near just intonation sounds out of tune to most people. Even<br/>&gt; if you stick to pure, &gt; well-intonated tetrads, the adjectives you get are things like<br/>&gt; &quot;horribly out of tune&quot; and &quot;extremely cacophonic&quot;.

The sonance, taken in isolation, should not it<br/>seems to me produce such a pronounces reaction. If the same chords<br/>appeared barbershop-style by way of adaptive JI on a basically 5-limit<br/>meantone substrate, I suspect the reaction would be different. My<br/>approach to 7-limit harmony is full-bore--I may use 11 or higher as<br/>flavoring, but when in the 7-limit I tend to use a lot of natively<br/>7-limit relationships. One piece, Choraled, has a lot of V/I movement,<br/>but even so the reaction is exactly the same.
