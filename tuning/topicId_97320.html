The use of 11 decimal digits was the more suitable method to achieve the results and it is obvious that it is not a common case that the following 12 cells are the initial elements of the second octave. Cell # 612 + 12 cells = cell # 624 equals (9/8)^6 and #624/#612 = 1.013643264777= pythagorean comma . These self forming values include (9/8)^(1/2), (9/8), (9/8)^(3/2).... etc, other features like the presence of cyclic relations of the pythagorean comma between ANY pair of cells distanced by 12 cell places.

Someone on NotOnlyMusic contacted Tolgahan and enquired about the price. Since it&apos;s a quality classical it was several thousand dollars.
