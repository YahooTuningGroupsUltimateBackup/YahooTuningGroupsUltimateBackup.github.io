I think that no interval is repeated. Now compare it to a chain of fifths. There are only two different intervals; the first division is identical, the second division can be mapped to different interval sizes; but the 10/9 is mapped to another 9/8, so the &quot;imitation of justness&quot; fails at this point.

You are getting at a property here, but<br/>the property has nothing to do with JI really; it is the number of<br/>generators, or &quot;rank&quot;. If one generator is a period, and you are<br/>constructing a periodic scale, the number of different step sizes in<br/>your scale is at least equal to the rank of the group you are using to<br/>define the notes. Of course, if the group you are using to define the<br/>notes is all the real numbers, that tells you nothing, but very often<br/>you will be using a regular tuning system defined by a free abelian<br/>group of some finite rank, meaning some finite number of independent<br/>generators.</p><p>Hence, Pythagorean scales must have at least two step sizes. The same<br/>is true of linear temperaments such as meantone or miracle. Five limit<br/>JI scales must have at least three step sizes. The same is true of<br/>planar temperaments such as marvel or breed.

If you say the period is an octave, or 1/n<br/>octave, that defines one of the generators. However, you don&apos;t need to<br/>refer to octaves at all, even if the tuning system has them, and to<br/>call something a &quot;period&quot; assumes you are constructing scales, which<br/>you don&apos;t necessarily need to be doing either.</p><p>&gt; (Actually, I had hoped that mentioning the absence of pocket<br/>&gt; calculators would have spared me your objection.

If one generator is a period, and you are<br/>  &gt; constructing a periodic scale, the number of different step sizes in<br/>  &gt; your scale is at least equal to the rank of the group you are using to<br/>  &gt; define the notes.</p><p>  I should say, rather, to *construct* the notes. You could define notes<br/>  in 5-limit JI and only construct them in 3-limit JI, and then you<br/>  could have two step sizes. Or you could leave off 3s and only use 5s,<br/>  or only use combinations of 2 and 5/3. But if the notes of your scale<br/>  generate a rank 3 group, then you cannot just have two step sizes in<br/>  it.
