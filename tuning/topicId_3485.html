James Murray Barbour himself<br/>suggested a Temperament by &quot;Regularly Varied Fifths&quot; which is similar in<br/>concept to Paul&apos;s save that Barbour used a linear increment and Paul a<br/>trigonometric formula. Barbour&apos;s tuning is given on pages 181-183 of<br/>&quot;Tuning and Temperament.&quot;</p><p>Barbour started with the fift D-A and added an increment to each fifth<br/>around the circle in both directions. The increments are 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +<br/>6 + 5 +4 +3 +2 +1 = 36 parts (from 700 cents). D-A is 3 parts flatter<br/>than 700; B-F# and F-C will have 700 cents and Ab-Eb will be 3 parts<br/>sharper than equal. Barbour recommends the part be 1 cent.</p><p>Barbour&apos;s tuning is tempered to a greater extent than Erlich&apos;s as his<br/>flattest fifth (D-A) has 697 cents and his sharpest, (Ab-Eb, has 703.<br/>The best thirds (C-E, G-B) have 392 cents and the worst ( Gb-Bb, Db-F)<br/>408. A part of 1.75 cents makes the best thirds just, but the worst<br/>about 414 cents.</p><p>Barbour doesn&apos;t describe the fifths and thirds of his tuning in as much<br/>detail as Paul did (and I don&apos;t have time today to do so myself, alas),<br/>but the chromatic octave is 0 92 197 297 392 500 591 699 794 894 999<br/>1091 and 1200 cents.</p><p>My recollection is that this subject was discussed a couple of years ago<br/>on the list.( Ed?)</p><p>Johnny: Congratulations on your trip to Russia! The Russians did a lot<br/>of microtonality after the revolution before Stalin, Zhdanov, etc. put a<br/>stop to it, but the scores and books are virtually unknown and<br/>unobtainable in the US,<br/>even in Russian. Do you think your contacts could locate some of these?<br/>&quot;Russian Theoretical Though in Music,&quot; by Gordon Daniel McQuere, UMI<br/>Research Press, 1983, gives some tantalizing clues about what must have<br/>been a very exciting period of exploration.</p><p>BTW, Nicholas Meeus has an post on musical phonemes on MTO-talk today.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>6/10/1999 11:05:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John writes: inre Barbour and his temperaments:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;My recollection is that this subject was discussed a couple of years ago<br/>&gt;on the list.( Ed?)</p><p>  I am not familiar with Barbour&apos;s tuning directly, but have been in<br/>correspondence with Owen Jorgensen lately.<br/>   Barbour made a well known statement in regards to the unequal tunings that<br/>his research had turned up.  He said, &quot;That would just sound like an out of<br/>tune piano!&quot;  I have had this thrown at me on numerous occasions, always by<br/>the ET-only advocates,  so I wrote to Jorgensen and asked if this was an<br/>informed opinion, or just theoretical conjecture.<br/>    Owen tells me that Barbour was a product of his time, and regarded ET as<br/>the final realized ideal, however, he had no experience listening to a modern<br/>piano tuned in Well Temperament until Jorgensen&apos;s recital and lecture in<br/>1967, three years before his death.  Upon hearing the program, he<br/>congratulated Owen on how good it all sounded and encouraged him to continue.</p><p>    I have not had a chance to investigate the Barbour temperaments, but hope<br/>to shortly.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
