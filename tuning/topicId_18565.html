Yeah, pop music is usually thought of<br/>as a melody with chord progression,  but I think what we remember about a<br/>&quot;hook&quot; includes lots of other stuff:  timbre, the &quot;grooviness&quot; of the<br/>beat, and yes, often a chord being spaced in that oh-so-sexy way.</p><p>I would say that more often than with a tune, a particular timbre/harmony<br/>keeps ringing in my head, continuously . . . .</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m all for learning to write a great line. . . .I&apos;m deeply<br/>interested in this in fact. . . but this classical-concert-promoter &quot;give<br/>me a tune I can hum&quot; is just a bunch of mindless fascism as far as I can<br/>tell.

Melodic skill came later, and rhythmic skill, much<br/>later than that. I say backwards because I agree with Jacky that<br/>melody is more fundamental than harmony, and I think rhythm is even<br/>more fundamental than that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for example, from one of our &quot;evil&quot; theorists:  Paul Erlich&apos;s TIBIA,<br/>&gt; yeah, I don&apos;t walk away whistling the bass line, but I do walk away<br/>&gt; remembering those harmonic progressions, and how I was feeling like<br/>&gt; &quot;eeaaaoooooooyeee&quot; or something every time they revealed their<br/>&gt; 22-toned-ness.</p><p>I hope &quot;eeaaaoooooooyeee&quot; is a good feeling -- that work is new to me<br/>-- though I think David Beardsley might call it &quot;queeeaseeey&quot; :)</p><p>&gt; Luckily, the way music affects most of us is (usually) not so<br/>&gt; one-dimensional.</p><p>That&apos;s an important point -- though melody is more fundamental than<br/>harmony, harmony affects the &quot;meaning&quot; of melody. For example, the<br/>Aeolian and Ionian modes were perhaps the fifth- and sixth-most common<br/>modes in purely melodic Western music (Gregorian chant), but became<br/>the two most common modes once triadic harmony developed and evolved<br/>into what is known as tonality (which is itself a particular synthesis<br/>of harmonic, melodic, and perhaps even</p></div><h3><a id=18705 href="#18705">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2001 9:36:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; for example, from one of our &quot;evil&quot; theorists:  Paul Erlich&apos;s TIBIA,<br/>&gt; &gt; yeah, I don&apos;t walk away whistling the bass line, but I do walk away<br/>&gt; &gt; remembering those harmonic progressions, and how I was feeling like<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;eeaaaoooooooyeee&quot; or something every time they revealed their<br/>&gt; &gt; 22-toned-ness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope &quot;eeaaaoooooooyeee&quot; is a good feeling -- that work is new to me<br/>&gt; -- though I think David Beardsley might call it &quot;queeeaseeey&quot; :)</p><p>I liked your pieces at AFMM 2000 very much.
