In fact you can get 7 triads with a different<br/>(but still non-diatonic) choice of 7 notes from this tuning.</p><p>         G#Ab-D#Eb<br/>         / \   /<br/>        /   \ /<br/>       E-----B<br/>      / \   / \<br/>     /   \ /   \<br/>    C-----G-----D<br/>   / \   /<br/>  /   \ /<br/>G#Ab-D#Eb</p><p>The smallest proper MOS it embeds in has 9 notes (with 12 triads) (e.g. in<br/>12-tET).

Note that the<br/>generator here can be either a fifth or a major third. They end up as the<br/>same 8 note scale. In 12-tET it is 12121212. Outside of 12-tET the minor<br/>thirds must stay at 300 cents but you are free to narrow the fifths to<br/>improve the major thirds. The 8 triads are</p><p>D#Eb--A#Bb<br/>  \   / \<br/>   \ /   \<br/>    F#----C#<br/>     \   / \<br/>      \ /   \<br/>       A-----E<br/>        \   / \<br/>         \ /   \<br/>          C-----G<br/>           \   / \<br/>            \ /   \<br/>            D#Eb--A#Bb</p><p>Delete any note and you lose 3 triads. Of course once you&apos;ve deleted a<br/>note, you might as well lose the lone third as well and tune the whole<br/>thing Just.</p><p>Here&apos;s the 9 note proper scale with 12 triads, based on 3 chains of fifths<br/>(or minor thirds) 1/3 octave apart. In 12-tET it&apos;s 121121121. The major<br/>thirds are stuck at 400 cents but you can widen the fifths to improve the<br/>minor thirds. If you lose an outside note you lose 3 triads. Lose a second<br/>note on the same side and you only lose another 2 triads, leaving 7 triads<br/>in 7 notes.</p><p>         C#Db--G#Ab--D#Eb<br/>         / \   / \   /<br/>        /   \ /   \ /<br/>       A-----E-----B<br/>      / \   / \   /<br/>     /   \ /   \ /<br/>    F-----C-----G<br/>   / \   / \   /<br/>  /   \ /   \ /<br/>C#Db--G#Ab--D#Eb</p><p>It would be interesting to see if I come up with all Graham Breed&apos;s 5-limit<br/>scales (plus the extra one in 22-tET) by a completely different method.<br/>I&apos;ll list the good two-chain generators (with a half-octave) soon.</p><p>Do these symmetrical 8 and 9 note scales have standard names?</p><p>By the way, why is this stuff in a thread called &quot;more on composing in X<br/>tuning&quot;?
