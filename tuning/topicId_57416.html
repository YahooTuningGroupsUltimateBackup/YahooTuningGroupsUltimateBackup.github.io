.<br/>why would that ratio be so important that it is the<br/>only one in the scale which required a decimal place?</p><p>. d&ucirc;g&acirc;h, because it&apos;s very close to the 3/2 ratio,<br/>but 3/2 would be exactly 666&amp;2/3 thousandths, and if<br/>he went thru the trouble of adding .5 to s&icirc;k&acirc;h then<br/>why wouldn&apos;t he use a decimal place here as well?<br/>i.e., ~666.7 or at the very least ~666.5 . if he was<br/>rounding to the nearest integer then it should be 667<br/>instead of 666.</p><p>. ash&icirc;r&acirc;n, for similar reasons: ash&icirc;r&acirc;n is extremely<br/>close to 9/8, which would be a value of 888&amp;8/9 (or ~888.9)<br/>thousandths, which rounds up to 889 instead of 888.</p><p>. jah&acirc;rk&acirc;h, for similar reasons: jah&acirc;rk&acirc;h is extremely<br/>close to 16/9, which would be a value of exactly 562.5<br/>thousandths. so if a decimal place was necessary for<br/>s&icirc;k&acirc;h, then why not here?</p><p>i also measured the thousandths for the ratios on my<br/>Arab Lute page, and none of them match either.</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/arablute/arablute.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/arablute/arablute.htm</a></p><p>i too would like to know more about this tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re correct that it doesn&apos;t even remotely resemble<br/>&gt; &gt; 24-edo.  however, among the smaller-cardinality EDOs,<br/>&gt; &gt; 36-edo gives a fairly decent approximation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or maybe 72-edo, since a few of the notes are close to x50 cents.</p><p>i looked at 72-edo, but concluded that it wasn&apos;t a very good<br/>approximation, because right off the bat, the very first two<br/>degrees after the 1:1 (n&icirc;m qab&acirc; his&acirc;r and qab&acirc; his&acirc;r) are<br/>basically midway between two 72-edo degrees.</p><p>when i saw that, i took a look at 144-edo, but again, there<br/>were a lot of notes that fell between the 144-edo degrees.</p><p>of course, the amount of absolute error keeps diminishing<br/>as the cardinality of the EDO increases, but the point is<br/>that if there are many notes lying between two EDO degrees,<br/>then that EDO is not a good approximation of the tuning.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2005 5:31:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

I think it&apos;s safe to assume dugah is 3/2, ashiran is 9/8 and jaharkah is 16/9, despite the unrounded numbers.</p><p>That seems the be the only symmetry in the tuning, other than the distance between yakah (low G) and qaba hisar (A-flat) being the same as the distance between hijaz (F-sharp/G-flat) and nawa (high G) being almost the same, about 123.5 cents. But why those two intervals and not anything else?</p><p>It&apos;s also not a very transposeable scale. I tested another tetrachord, Hijaz, and for dugah (D), I got something close to [1/1 16/15 5/4 4/3], but for ajam (A), the third note was too high.

Blame it on the crooked nationalism imported<br/>from the West that still plagues us today. Rauf Yekta was the pioneer of the<br/>nationalization of &grave;Turkish Maqam Music&grave; back then. Chauvanism against being<br/>blotted out by imperialist superpowers was the order of the day, and being<br/>the first official musicologist of Turkey, Yekta adopted a peculiar<br/>supremacist attitude of his own, where he went to the ends of the earth to<br/>prove that Maqam Musicians played the exact SAME intervals as demanded by<br/>pure Western (human) ears.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, his efforts were never enough to swerve Republican<br/>state policy from prohibiting Maqam Music heritage from public institutions<br/>(let alone convince his Western contemporaries of the superiority of Turkish<br/>Art Music over 12-tone temperament). That was due to the fact that Maqam<br/>Music was perceived to be old-fashioned, out-dated, obsolete and immoral,<br/>aside from being dangerous. No doubt, Eastern ears did not buy the nonsense<br/>that &grave;all humans naturally want to hear the same stuff&grave;. A systematical<br/>reform of the hearing organ therefore was the chief method of Modernizing<br/>(Westernizing) the primitives... or so the state decreed.</p><p>Rauf Yekta&apos;s cry to this outrage was simply: &grave;This is a homicide!&grave;. The ban<br/>on Maqam Music education in the only conservatory in entire Turkey during<br/>the late 1920s was the start of the mortal clash between Alla Turca and Alla<br/>Franca that still prevails in some circles. Ever hear of ear-washing?<br/>Imagine a medium where two knowledgable musicians educated in two different<br/>cultures accuse each other of inferior hearing... It is a relief that<br/>arabesque and pop infiltrated these lands long before that.</p><p>The 24-tone Yekta scale (right next to Raghib Bey&apos;s scala file) is the<br/>solution proposed by Yekta to invalidate the argument that Maqam Music<br/>cannot be polyphonalized. Imagine his grief when it became apparent that the<br/>state did not recognize such a thing as microtonal polyhpony despite the<br/>fact that such great pioneers as Charles Ives and Bela Bartok were very much<br/>alive by then!</p><p>It&apos;s a pity that Yekta could not implement the reform he had in mind. From<br/>the way the Cairo Congress ended, it is evident that he could not convince<br/>the Arabs either. Instead, his followers Arel and Ezgi used his example to<br/>tear the final links to the authentic Middle Eastern maqam culture. In their<br/>reckless zeal, the triumvirate delivered a fatal blow to the very life<br/>source of this tradition.</p><p>We can only take pride in sustaining a comatose music today. Most of what is<br/>composed new in the name of Maqam Music is probably garbage.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Daniel A.
