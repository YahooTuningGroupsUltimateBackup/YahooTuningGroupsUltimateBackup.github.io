Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2001 1:26:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I wonder if you could give that web site ref, I don&apos;t think I know<br/>&gt;it?</p><p>Robert, before you look at my responses below, the web site in question is<br/><a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter.html</a><br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter.html</a>&gt; ; scroll down to Perception of<br/>Auditory Pitch, and read all the articles linked to below it.</p><p>Also I&apos;d recommend strongly you find Pierce&apos;s book _Science and Musical<br/>Sound_. Go to a library and read the chapters &quot;Helmholtz and Consonance&quot; and<br/>then &quot;Rameau and Harmony&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Make a timbre which is inharmonic, but with a very strong &gt;partial in it,<br/>which<br/>&gt;one perceives as the pitch of the note.</p><p>The magic of harmonic timbres is that one perceives a pitch even though<br/>there isn&apos;t one very strong partial -- and the pitch of the timbre might not<br/>even correspond to _any_ of the partials. The less the partials correspond<br/>to a harmonic series, the less certain you&apos;ll be as to what pitch you&apos;re<br/>perceiving.</p><p>Yes, there are lots of percussion instruments that have a pretty clear<br/>pitch, at least clearly classifiable in terms of position in a given scale.<br/>But the spectrum there is usually just like white noise through a band-pass<br/>filter. All the energy of the sound is in a very narrow frequency range.<br/>This is very different from the situation in which you have an inharmonic<br/>timbre and used the intervals among the partials are used to construct<br/>chords, etc.</p><p>But let&apos;s keep going with your example. Basically, since one partial is loud<br/>enough to be perceives as the pitch, and the timbre is inharmonic, the other<br/>partials are just perceived as a kind of added noise and don&apos;t contribute to<br/>the perception of the pitch of the timbre.</p><p>&gt;Play it lots of times at various pitches, until one gets used to it.<br/>&gt;Perhaps do that by assigning it to a keyboard and asking someone to<br/>&gt;play tunes on it, since when one is using a timbre interactively like<br/>&gt;that, one pays more attention to it somehow.</p><p>&gt;Now, try synthesising it again, and leave out the strong partial that is<br/>&gt;usually present, and add, say, a weaker partial an octave below it,<br/>&gt;so that one has some cue to lead one to it, (as one has for a bell sound).</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what the analogy is with the bell sound at all.</p><p>But overall, sounds like a very interesting line of thought toward some<br/>fascinating experimental investigations, Robert!</p></div>
