I&apos;ve got Robert Smith&apos;s book in front of me, and he<br/>definately and explicitly mentions 50-et, though he is not proposing<br/>that it be used in practice. It is an approximation to 5/18-comma<br/>meantone, which he obtains by a process of weighted averaging over<br/>three octaves worth of consonances, and is almost exactly ten times<br/>closer to 50-et than Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma. Smith also averges over four<br/>octaves and obtains 11/40-comma meantone, which is not very different,<br/>being well approximated by 50-et also.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know more about Konrad Henfling, but it seems<br/>quite possible that Robert Smith is the first to discuss 50-et and to<br/>notice, as Woolhouse does later, that it is a reasonable choice as an<br/>optimum or near optimum.</p></div><h3><a id=57607 href="#57607">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2005 2:01:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve got Robert Smith&apos;s book in front of me, and he<br/>&gt; definately and explicitly mentions 50-et, though he is not proposing<br/>&gt; that it be used in practice.
