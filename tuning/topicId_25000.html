In 1567, the year of Queen<br/>Mary&apos;s forced abdication while in captivity at Lochleven (24 July), an<br/>Italian composer named Gorzanis published a collection of 48 dances, two<br/>with each of the 12 notes of the chromatic lute gamut as a modal final.</p><p>Galilei, interestingly, regarded the lute an especially<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; instrument because of its equal semitones, making a diminished<br/>fourth and major third identical -- and considered keyboard instruments<br/>&quot;defective&quot; in this regard, although when he tried 12-tET (or the closest<br/>equivalent he could accurately tune, Ed Foote might add, although maybe a<br/>lute could serve as a guide), he found the results less pleasant.</p><p>Writing around 1600, Giovanni Maria Artusi takes this equivalence as<br/>natural on the lute, and considers it &quot;older than the cuckoo<br/>birds,&quot; although Mark Lindley concludes that the widespread<br/>&quot;standardization&quot; of 12-tET may have occurred around 1550, during Mary&apos;s<br/>childhood in France in terms of your performance situation.</p><p>Your mention of Milan, however, is an illustration of another of Lindley&apos;s<br/>points -- that 12-tET was not a _universal_ standard throughout the 16th<br/>century, especially the earlier part. Specifically, he recommends a<br/>meantone interpretation for some compositions by Milan dating to around<br/>the 1530&apos;s. He _likes_ the beating of meantone fifths, and finds that it<br/>gives the music a &quot;warm&quot; quality.</p><p>This is discussed in his book, entitled something like _Lutes, Viols, and<br/>Temperaments_.</p><p>Thus judging by what Zarlino and Vicentino say in the 1550&apos;s, I might<br/>guess that David Rizzio, at least, might have used equal semitones (or a<br/>close approximation) on his lute.</p><p>Since so much of Queen Mary&apos;s cultural background was shaped in France,<br/>one might want to investigate the literature there, to see if lute<br/>intonation was discussed.</p><p>Anyway, while as people have mentioned, there were various tuning schemes<br/>for lute, 12-tET seems to be the &quot;standard&quot; lute temperament of the later<br/>16th century.</p><p>I might add that there were &quot;alternative fretters&quot; back then, too: Galilei<br/>describes how they would add _tastini_ or extra &quot;little frets&quot; for purer<br/>thirds, and complains that this is outside the proper diatonic and<br/>chromatic genera, and also that in practice the sensitivity of these<br/>people&apos;s ears can be judged by the number of &quot;imperfect&quot; (i.e. Wolf)<br/>fifths they play in navigating those extra frets.</p><p>Anyway, this is a quick summary. One reason that 12-tET may have been not<br/>to hard to approximate is that the &quot;18 rule&quot; -- fretting with semitones of<br/>18:17 -- happens to get an assist from the physics of the actual fretting<br/>so that it can be more accurate than the &quot;correct&quot; logarithmic fretting.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
