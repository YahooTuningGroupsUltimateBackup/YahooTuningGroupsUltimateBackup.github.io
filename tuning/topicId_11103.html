I discuss &quot;tetrachordality&quot; --<br/>the idea that every octave species of a &quot;good&quot; scale should contain<br/>two 4/3 spans with an identical arrangement of step sizes. For<br/>example, the diatonic scale satisfies this property:</p><p>(C D E F) (G A B C)<br/>(D E F G) (A B C D)<br/>(E F G A) (B C D E)<br/>F (G A B (C) D E F)<br/>(G A B (C) D E F) G  or  G (A B C (D) E F G)<br/>A (B C D (E) F G A)  or  (A B C (D) E F G) A<br/>(B C D (E) F G A) B</p><p>The usual pentatonic scales, and one of the two classes of decatonic<br/>scales in my paper, satisfy this property. Many other world scales<br/>are<br/>&quot;tetrachordal&quot; in some, but not all, octave species. One could thus<br/>define a fractional &quot;tetrachordality&quot; measure. Kraig Grady&apos;s 7-limit<br/>JI Centaur scale, which we recently discussed, has a decent amount of<br/>tetrachordality both as a 12-tone whole and in its scalar subsets.</p><p>Then there are &quot;altered&quot; scales that deviate from this logic in one<br/>spot -- if this deviation has a strong harmonic raison d&apos;etre<br/>(preferably otonal rather than utonal), it is accepted quite readily.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2000 7:27:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The Dictionary, which I can usually depend on to have what I&apos;m looking<br/>&gt;for no matter how obscure, is curiously devoid of definitions for<br/>&gt;&quot;stability,&quot; &quot;efficiency,&quot; &quot;redundancy,&quot; or anything beginning with<br/>&gt;&quot;Rothenberg.&quot; Could someone please explain these to me?</p><p>You can read excerpts of Rothenberg&apos;s own article -- I referenced it in<br/>my last post on the topic.
