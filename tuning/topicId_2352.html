I&apos;ll have to take the brunt of the criticism here.</p><p>John Chalmers did the calculating and plotting,<br/>but those lattices are actually based on some ideas<br/>I had about a month ago.</p><p>(John even changed the name of his &apos;New Chalmers Plot&apos;<br/>to &apos;Doubly Proportional Monzo Plot&apos;, so when you see<br/>NCP and DPMP on the webpages, they refer to the same method.)</p><p>They didn&apos;t turn out anything like what I had expected.</p><p>I got the idea one day to make the vector-lengths of<br/>all the different primes give the same radial distance<br/>from 1/1, to show the cents value of the ratios/lattice-points<br/>on the same scale for all the primes.</p><p>After I had mentioned that idea to Chalmers, I had another<br/>idea to octave-reduce the whole lattice.</p><p>I tried drawing both of these by hand, but without<br/>doing calculatons and without using rulers, protractors, etc.<br/>Needless to say, they came out looking horrible.</p><p>I thought that it would be fairly straightforward to<br/>get someone conversant with the math (Chalmers) to<br/>plot them on a computer, and these are the result.</p><p>John has mentioned to me the idea of actually putting<br/>those webpages and commentary together in a coherent<br/>manner, but I don&apos;t think I can do it.  I leave it for him.<br/>Or anyone else who understands what he did (perhaps you?)</p><p>Actually, because I don&apos;t fully understand how he did them,<br/>I&apos;m not even sure how well they represent what I orignally<br/>thought of.  I *think* we&apos;re both on the same track,<br/>but not completely sure.</p><p>I had imagined that the lattices would more-or-less<br/>retain the familiar shape that my &apos;regular&apos; ones have.<br/>I never expected them to have such weird angles.<br/>But then again, I know absolutely nothing about trigonometry.</p><p>The one I called &apos;7-Limit Diamond,<br/>Scaled Proportional Monzo Plot&apos;, at:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/w-jchalm/1999-4-7/message2/transitio">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/w-jchalm/1999-4-7/message2/transitio</a><br/>nal-lattices.htm<br/>is pretty close to what I originally drew.</p><p>It&apos;s not so easy to know what&apos;s happening without data<br/>labels either.  I&apos;ll try to remedy that when I have time.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
