Not only does this improve the fifths and ninths in many<br/>of the best keys, but you will also find that both the major and<br/>minor thirds beat very slowly, something that you don&apos;t have in 19-<br/>ET, 31-ET, or most of the variants of the meantone temperament.  It<br/>also gives rather good subminor (6:7:9) and supermajor (14:18:21)<br/>triads, much better than in 19-ET; this is achieved with a relatively<br/>small alteration in the size of the 19-ET fifth.</p><p>I wanted the circle of 19 fifths to be a well-temperament.  To keep<br/>the rest of the fifths from getting too large, I put all of my fifths<br/>of that size in a single series -- just enough for the keys of F, C,<br/>and G.  So my ~695.61-cent fifths (twelve in number) are from F to E-<br/>sharp, and the remaining seven fifths start on F-flat (same pitch as<br/>E-sharp, but renamed) and end at F.  These are ~693.23 cents, or<br/>~8.72 cents narrow.</p><p>&gt; So here&apos;s the open chain of 21 fifths (22 notes) that gets mapped<br/>to a straight line (gently sloping upward to the right) on the<br/>keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Na Fifth    Odentity<br/>&gt; me (cents)  for middle octad<br/>&gt; ----------------------------<br/>&gt; Bb 692.28<br/>&gt; F  695.61<br/>&gt; C  695.61  1<br/>&gt; G  695.61  3<br/>&gt; D  695.61  9<br/>&gt; A  695.61<br/>&gt; E  695.61  5<br/>&gt; B  695.61<br/>&gt; F# 695.61<br/>&gt; C# 695.61<br/>&gt; G# 695.61<br/>&gt; D# 695.61<br/>&gt; A# 695.61  7<br/>&gt; E# 692.28<br/>&gt; B# 692.28<br/>&gt; G[ 692.28        (Fx)<br/>&gt; D[ 695.61        (Cx)<br/>&gt; A[ 695.61  13    (Gx)<br/>&gt; E[ 723.20 to Bb] and 692.28 to Bb       (Dx)<br/>&gt; B[ 695.61        (Ax)<br/>&gt; F] 695.61  11    (Ex)<br/>&gt; C]               (Bx)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [ and ] stand for half flat and half sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Average fifth size is 696.29, so this can be used in my spreadsheet<br/>to generate the keyboard.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/KeyboardMapper.xls">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/KeyboardMapper.xls</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s slightly more than one octave of the keyboard, showing cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Bx<br/>&gt;  Ax         34                        Ex<br/>&gt; 1043                        Dx       539                        Ax<br/>&gt;                   Cx       320                        Gx       1043<br/>&gt;         B#       129                        Fx       824<br/>&gt;        1144                       E#<br/>636                        B#<br/>&gt;                         D#       452<br/>A#       1144<br/>&gt;               C#       261                        G#       956<br/>&gt;     B         69                        F#       765<br/>&gt;    1078                       E        574                        B<br/>&gt;                     D        382                        A<br/>1078<br/>&gt;           C        191                        G        887<br/>&gt; Bb        0                         F<br/>696                        C<br/>&gt; 1012                               504<br/>Bb        0<br/>&gt;                                                              1012</p><p>Your mapping (in the sharp direction) is exactly what I did.  For<br/>clarity, I also renamed the three 11 factors:<br/>  Ax as B-semiflat<br/>  Ex as F-semisharp<br/>  Bx as C-semisharp<br/>We mapped these three tones in the same places that they would be in<br/>31-ET, and the three tones that you renamed D[, A[, and E[ also occur<br/>in the same places as for 31-ET.  So you can play the 15-limit<br/>otonalities on F, C, and G in this 19+3 temperament on the Bosanquet<br/>keyboard as if you were in 31-ET -- exactly the same fingering<br/>patterns in both systems!</p><p>&gt; You wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Mapping 19 on the Bosanquet keyboard is fairly straightforward.<br/>You<br/>&gt; &gt;would only need to specify how many keys (including duplicates)<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;be used per octave: from which flat or double-flat to which sharp<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt;double-sharp).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand why we _need_ to use any duplicates. Since we<br/>can do it with 22 keys per octave (from Bb to Bx) as above. But I<br/>suppose you might _want_ some duplicates to make it easier when<br/>playing right around the cycle of fifths. One could put a copy of Dx<br/>in the Eb position, Gx in the Ab position and Cx in the Db position.<br/>It wouldn&apos;t make much sense to go back any further since we&apos;d be into<br/>the near-wolves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the keyboard with these duplicates (for a total of 25 keys<br/>per octave) and showing the odentities for the middle octad (reduced<br/>to within a single octave).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Bx<br/>&gt;  Ax                                  (11)<br/>&gt;                             Dx                                  Ax<br/>&gt;                   Cx                                 (13)<br/>&gt;         B#                                  Fx<br/>&gt;<br/>E#                                  B#<br/>&gt;                         D#                                 (7)<br/>&gt;               C#                                  G#<br/>&gt;     B                                   F#<br/>&gt;                              (5)                                  B<br/>&gt;                    (9)                                  A<br/>&gt;          (1)                                 (3)<br/>&gt; Bb<br/>F                                   1<br/>&gt;                           Dx                                  Bb<br/>&gt;                 Cx       (Eb)                       Gx<br/>&gt;                (Db)                                (Ab)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, regarding duplicates, maybe I don&apos;t understand what additional<br/>constraints a Bosanquet keyboard places on the general idea of linear-<br/>temperament-based keyboards.</p><p>The duplicates are necessary because we are mapping a *circle* of 19<br/>onto a *linear* type of keyboard.  One of the requirements of my<br/>challenge was to have the same fingering patterns in every key.<br/>Since you would want to be able to play a major scale and major triad<br/>on E-flat, for example, the same way you would on C, you would need<br/>at least 6 duplicate keys per octave to do this in every key.</p><p>An additional problem is posed by the thumb.  My experience with the<br/>generalized keyboard Scalatron is that it quickly gets tiring to have<br/>to reach for the keys that are farthest from the edge of the keyboard<br/>(i.e., the edge closest to the player).  Providing duplicate keys in<br/>the flat direction remedies this problem.  My solution takes the<br/>circle of 19 all the way to Abb, and the B[, F], and C] keys are also<br/>duplicated in the Cbb, Gbb, and Dbb positions (which, again, is<br/>exactly where they occur in 31-ET.)  This is a grand total of 34 keys<br/>per octave.</p><p>&gt; &gt; (And I hope you&apos;re having fun with this.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh yes! Thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would never have imagined such a thing was possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The errors in many of the rooted intervals are huge. 13 cents in<br/>the 1:7, 1:9 and 1:11 and 16 cents in the 1:13. I suppose it is the<br/>fact that they are all in the same direction that makes the tuning<br/>worthwhile.</p><p>My E[ (as 13/8 of G) is about 18 cents too low, but it still sounds<br/>convincing in a 7:9:11:13 chord in that key, inasmuch as the 13 is<br/>false by only about 5.5 cents with respect to 7, 9, and 11.  The<br/>8:10:13 chord is not as successful, but it still works.  The really<br/>remarkable thing is that G to E[ must sound like 8:13, but in the key<br/>of Eb this same interval must sound like 5:8 -- and heard in the<br/>appropriate tonal context, it does!  Before I discovered this, I,<br/>too, would never have imagined such a thing was possible.</p><p>I&apos;ll be posting the specifics of the 19+3 temperament in a separate<br/>message, along with a summary of its features and diagrams of the<br/>left and right-hand accordion keyboards.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38287 href="#38287">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2002 7:13:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>*BURIED TREASURE*<br/>&quot;Microtonal Accordion with 19+3 Temperament&quot;<br/>From: George Secor<br/>June 28, 2002</p><p>Here&apos;s the microtonal accordion design I promised, complete with a<br/>suitable multi-purpose tuning.  (For prior discussion, including all<br/>of the details of the microtonal accordion challenge, please see<br/>messages #37869, 37887, 37930, 37954, 38010, 38076, 38109, 38132, and<br/>38168.)</p><p>*The Challenge*</p><p>The tuning was required to be no more than more than about 22 tones<br/>per octave, to permit playing most conventional diatonic music (i.e.,<br/>without a comma problem), to have a circle of more than 12 fifths<br/>around which one could freely modulate, and to have 15-limit<br/>otonalities in at least 3 different keys (temperament is okay, but<br/>not so much as to lose the identities of ratios of 11 and 13).</p><p>This was to be mapped onto a Bosanquet generalized keyboard so that<br/>*all* of the above could be played with uniform fingering patterns in<br/>*all* available keys.</p><p>*The Solution*</p><p>The tuning is a 19-tone well temperament (19-WT) with 3 auxiliary<br/>tones to supply the 11 factors for the three 15-limit otonalities,<br/>which are built on F, C, and G.  The circle of 19 fifths has twelve<br/>fifths from F to E-sharp of ~695.61 cents, or ~6.34 cents narrow<br/>(such that 8 consective fifths give an exact 9:7).  The remaining<br/>seven fifths are of equal size and start on F-flat (same pitch as E-<br/>sharp, but renamed) and end at F; these are ~693.23 cents, or ~8.72<br/>cents narrow.  The three auxiliary tones (B-semiflat, F-semisharp,<br/>and C-semisharp) are tuned as just 11:9&apos;s above G, D, and A,<br/>respectively.</p><p>This tuning has three purposes:</p><p>1) As a (~5/17 comma) variant of the meantone temperament, it has<br/>slow-beating thirds, both major (~3.86 cents narrow) and minor (~2.48<br/>cents narrow).  The flat keys are not among the best, but old music<br/>originally intended for the meantone temperament that is written in<br/>these keys could be played a minor second lower, which would be<br/>closer to the historical pitch.</p><p>2) It has a closed circle of 19 fifths, so it is an alternative to 19-<br/>ET.  (The pitches in 19-WT do not depart more than about +-7 cents<br/>from 19-ET if A is tuned to the same frequency in both.)</p><p>3) By adding the three auxiliary tones, there are 15-limit<br/>otonalities on F, C, and G, with the overall intonation being better<br/>than with 31-ET (with 7:9:11 being exact).  In just intonation, this<br/>would require 18 tones, but in the 19+3 temperament 80:81 vanishes,<br/>so 17 tones (out of the total of 22) are used to fulfill this<br/>requirement.</p><p>The most amazing thing about this temperament is that F to D-flat, C<br/>to A-flat, and G to E-flat must each function as 8:13 (neutral sixth)<br/>in the 15-limit otonalities and as 5:8 (minor sixth) in the circle of<br/>19 fifths -- and heard in the appropriate tonal context, it works!<br/>Before completing the design of this temperament, I would never have<br/>imagined such a thing was possible.  (I devised it in the winter of<br/>1978, and it was published in the first issue of _Interval_, which<br/>appeared in the spring of that year.)</p><p>*The Treble Keyboard*</p><p>The treble keyboard proposed for the 19+3 temperament is a slight<br/>modification of the design that was used on the generalized keyboard<br/>Scalatron.  It differs only in the size and shape of the keys.  The<br/>distance between the centers of adjacent Scalatron keys (~7/8 inch)<br/>was made the same as the white keys of the piano; I subsequently<br/>found that it would not have been necessary to make them that large.<br/>Using round keys about 18 mm in diameter and 20 mm center-to-center<br/>(as on the European chromatic button accordion) would have been<br/>suitable, and with the space limitations posed by the accordion, that<br/>is exactly what I have done for this microtonal instrument.  A two<br/>octave layout may be seen here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KbAc19p3.gif</p><p>An actual instrument would have about 3-2/3 octaves of keys for the<br/>right hand.  The keyboard is pictured as the right hand would &quot;see&quot;<br/>it; when the instrument is played, it would be in a nearly vertical<br/>plane, with the keys pictured at the left (i.e., the low notes) at<br/>the top.  The seven naturals are white, five sharps are black, and<br/>five flats are red; the keys for the remaining two tones in the<br/>remote part of the circle of 19 are a grayish-pink (or mauve).</p><p>There are a total of 28 keys per octave used for 19-WT tones<br/>(including nine duplicates), which permit uniform fingering patterns<br/>in all 19 keys.  The three auxiliary tones are provided keys at both<br/>the upper and lower edges of the keyboard (colored cyan), in the same<br/>positions in which they would occur in 31-ET, making a grand total of<br/>34 keys per octave.  Since the fingering patterns are the same in all<br/>keys, this keyboard would be much easier to learn than a piano<br/>keyboard, since all scales, chords, etc. would need to be learned in<br/>only a single key.</p><p>These duplicate keys also serve another function.  My experience with<br/>the generalized keyboard Scalatron has shown that it quickly gets<br/>tiring to have to reach for the keys that are farthest from the edge<br/>of the keyboard (i.e., the edge closest to the player) with the thumb<br/>or little finger.  Providing duplicate keys in the flat direction,<br/>both for the sharps and for the three auxiliary tones remedies this<br/>problem.</p><p>*The Bass System*</p><p>Implementation of the generalized Bosanquet geometry for the left<br/>hand button-board requires some modification in light of the fact<br/>that the left thumb cannot be used, which has at least two<br/>consequences:</p><p>1) The cross-over-the-thumb scale technique used for the right hand<br/>is not available for the left, so unless some modification were made,<br/>unnatural twisting would occur in the fingering technique.  (This<br/>problem also occurs with the bassetti free bass system, but is<br/>elegantly solved with the Moschino system.)</p><p>2) The physical distance the fingers can reach is less, so without<br/>any modification the interval reach would be restricted.</p><p>The layout of buttons in my adaptation of the Bosanquet keyboard for<br/>the left hand is shown here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/AcLH19p3.gif</p><p>This shows an actual range of 3-2/3 octaves (with E1 as the lowest<br/>note), which would be both useful and practical.  As with the right-<br/>hand keyboard, there are 34 buttons per octave, with nine duplicate<br/>buttons per octave in the circle of 19 and the three auxiliary tones<br/>placed at both edges.  The bassboard is pictured as the left hand<br/>would &quot;see&quot; it; when the instrument is played, it would be in a<br/>nearly vertical plane, with the buttons pictured at the right (i.e.,<br/>the high notes) at the top.</p><p>Twisting in scale passages is eliminated by the fact that if the<br/>index finger or little finger is positioned on a given button, the<br/>remaining fingers may easily access both higher and lower notes due<br/>to the fact that the pitch changes in one direction along the nearly<br/>lateral rows (tones separated by 3deg19) and in the opposite<br/>direction along the nearly perpendicular rows (tones separated by<br/>2deg19), a feature that was introduced in 1960 on the Moschino free<br/>bass system.</p><p>The same modification that eliminates the above-mentioned twisting<br/>also causes buttons an octave apart to be positioned closer to one<br/>another, putting the interval of a tenth or twelfth within easy<br/>reach.  The octave distance is, in fact, almost exactly the same as<br/>on the 12-ET bassetti free bass system; but since most<br/>implementations of the bassetti system lack duplicate buttons and<br/>require some finger-twisting to play scales, the 19+3 bass system<br/>would definitely be easier to play.</p><p>The above diagram does not show the dimensions of the bass buttons,<br/>inasmuch as they would not be large enough to label.  The actual<br/>dimensions of the layout are shown here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/BassComp.gif</p><p>This diagram compares the 19+3 system with the Moschino system (the<br/>latter ascending by major thirds in the eight lateral rows and<br/>descending chromatically moving along a diagonal from the upper left<br/>to the lower right); both are shown with a range of 2-2/3 octaves.<br/>(Conventional accordion bass and chord buttons have the same angles<br/>and spacing as shown for the Moschino system; the Moschino system<br/>differs from the conventional accordion in that it has 8 rows of<br/>buttons, half of these being duplicates.)  Observe that the 19+3<br/>generalized bass setup does not require much more area than a 12-ET<br/>Moschino system with the same range (and most Moschino accordions<br/>were built with a larger range: over 5 octaves for the left hand).</p><p>All of the bass buttons are black; color-coding is of no value since<br/>the player cannot see the buttons.  Instead some of the buttons would<br/>be touch-coded, as indicated in the diagram.</p><p>*In Summary*</p><p>The accordion would be an excellent candidate for a microtonal<br/>keyboard instrument.  It&apos;s very portable, stable in pitch, produces<br/>its sound acoustically (rather than electronically), and has a timbre<br/>rich in harmonics that would easily define intervals above the 5<br/>limit.  It also has a naturally &quot;straight&quot; sound, lacking the sort of<br/>devices intended to enhance or liven up electronic sounds (vibrato,<br/>phase shifting, etc.) that tend to obscure the differences between 12-<br/>ET and alternate tunings.</p><p>The 19+3 temperament which I am proposing for use on a microtonal<br/>accordion is a multi-purpose tuning with a very reasonable number of<br/>tones in the octave.  In its best keys it comes close to<br/>approximating the meantone temperament, while offering free<br/>modulation within a circle of 19 fifths.  It also offers 15-limit<br/>otonalities with an accuracy that cannot be matched by any equal<br/>division of less than 41 tones.</p><p>The proposed left and right-hand keyboards are generalized, with<br/>uniform fingering patterns in all keys.  Having had the experience of<br/>learning two new keyboards (the Moschino accordion free bass system<br/>in 1962 and the Bosanquet generalized keyboard Scalatron in 1975), I<br/>have no doubt that an accordion with this design would be easy to<br/>learn and a delight to play.</p><p>*In Closing*</p><p>I extend my congratulations to Dave Keenan, for successfully<br/>participating in the microtonal accordion challenge.  He figured out<br/>just about everything that could have done on paper without actually<br/>having a generalized keyboard instrument on which to try it out.<br/>(Besides, he had only a few days, whereas it took me over two years<br/>working with a Scalatron to come up with the 19+3 temperament.)</p><p>And thanks to Mats &Ouml;ljare for expressing the desire that someday a<br/>microtonal accordion might become a reality.  I hope that my design<br/>might help to make that happen.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38288 href="#38288">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>6/28/2002 8:11:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My compliments too!

Why, percussion<br/>instruments, of course, which brings up the question: How would the<br/>19+3 pitches be arranged on a xylophone or metallophone?</p><p>While the slanting rows of the generalized keyboard arrangement could<br/>be adapted to percussion instruments (in a series from Bb to Dx,<br/>followed by the 3 auxiliary tones), I would prefer to keep the bars<br/>in straight lateral rows to simplify the construction.  This would<br/>also allow the use of a single damper bar running the length of the<br/>instrument for metallophones with a sustained tone (such as a<br/>vibraphone or tubulongs).  Since the 19+3 temperament (a 22-tone set)<br/>is not a constant structure, there is no obvious way to do this, and<br/>I didn&apos;t have a clue!</p><p>There are a couple of ways to do 19-ET in tubulongs.  One is to use a<br/>7+5+7 arrangement:</p><p>Cb    Db    Eb Fb    Gb    Ab    Bb Cb<br/>   C#    D#       F#    G#    A#<br/>C     D     E  F     G     A     B  C</p><p>(If viewing this online, use the &quot;expand messages&quot; option to achieve<br/>the proper spacing.)</p><p>Another (less compact) way would use a 7+7+5 arrangement:</p><p>   C#    D#          F#    G#    A#<br/>C     D     E     F     G     A     B     C<br/>   Db    Eb    Fb    Gb    Ab    Bb    Cb</p><p>So where do you put the three auxiliary tones of the 19+3<br/>temperament?  I had struggled with that problem off and on for 24<br/>years but didn&apos;t think about that when I made the statement that I<br/>quoted above.</p><p>I&apos;m happy to report that when I looked at the problem again this past<br/>Saturday morning, it suddenly hit me to try something different, and<br/>within twenty minutes I found a solution.  It requires no more space<br/>than the 7+5+7 arrangement for 19-ET:</p><p>C+ Db D#    E# F+ Gb G#    A# Bd B# C+<br/>         Eb             Ab<br/>C  C# D     E  F  F# G     A  Bb B  C</p><p>Note:  + (I really wanted a not-equals sign) indicates a semisharp,<br/>and d indicates a semiflat.</p><p>For instruments not requiring both resonators and a damper bar, the<br/>tones may be arranged in 3 rows of 10+2+10, as shown.  Otherwise, E-<br/>flat and A-flat may be moved into the nearest row for a vibraphone<br/>(or it may be preferable to do *all* of the pitched percussion that<br/>way -- does Jon Szanto have an opinion?).  The tones of the nearest<br/>row together with the middle row are those in a series of fifths from<br/>A-flat to C-sharp, so a glissando played on these tones would<br/>simulate a 12-tone chromatic scale.</p><p>If the five flats Db, Eb, Gb, Ab, and Bb are colored darker than the<br/>rest, they will produce a two-and-three visual pattern that would be<br/>helpful in finding one&apos;s way around.</p><p>Observe that all tones in the farthest row that are in the circle of<br/>19 are 1 degree higher in pitch than those in the nearest row.  Also,<br/>all three auxiliary tones are in the farthest row and are placed<br/>opposite tones in the nearest row that are 1/2-degree lower.  If the<br/>two tones in the middle row are considered to occupy both of the<br/>other two rows simultaneously, then the sets of tones in the nearest<br/>and farthest rows taken separately are constant structures.  Thus<br/>there is logic and consistency underlying the entire arrangement.</p><p>So now it&apos;s possible to build a set of tubulongs in the 19+3<br/>temperament.  Any takers?</p><p>--George</p></div>
