His style is very broad based, with Chet Atkins and Django<br/>Reinhard perhaps being his strongest influences; he&apos;s a great<br/>fingerpicker, as well as flatpicker, and his onstage manner was a riot.<br/>He made my eyes pop out constantly, but was always very musical as well.<br/>A very humorous man, with great and easy stage presence...I would surely<br/>say he&apos;s as impressive as John McLaughlin or Paco de Lucia. I don&apos;t know<br/>how his CD&apos;s stack up to his live shows, but all of you geetar fans<br/>might want to look into this feller...Hstick</p></div>
