The<br/>7:9 has been pretty much rejected as not one that is<br/>likely to be instinctively accepted as a smooth consonance.</p><p>I&apos;ve made a MIDI file of some possibilities for this<br/>&apos;high 3rd&apos;, with some interesting results.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid</a></p><p>The chord is sequenced like the old Three Stooges<br/>&apos;hello hello hello&apos; routine: in 4/4 time, the ratios<br/>1/1 on the first beat, 5/4 on the third, and 3/2 on the<br/>first beat of the second measure, with pitch-bend applied<br/>continuously to the 5/4 between the first and second beats<br/>of the second measure to create a glissando up to the target<br/>&apos;high 3rd&apos;.  Here are the possibilities I used:</p><p>1) m1-2  The 4:5 is held thru the entire chord.<br/>I agree with Jerry that it doesn&apos;t sound like what<br/>singers normally do.</p><p>2) m3-4  The 4:5 slides upward to 64:81.<br/>This was the one that I thought would have sounded<br/>the smoothest, based on the numerics of the ratios.<br/>Not bad, but (surprisingly) to my ears not the best;<br/>it sounds like it goes a little too sharp.</p><p>3) m5-6  The 4:5 slides upward to 2^(4/12).<br/>To me, surprisingly, this was a close second-best.<br/>Perhaps the role of cultural conditioning plays<br/>a stronger part than we realize.</p><p>4) m7-8  The 4:5 slides upward to 19:24.<br/>Most surprisingly of all, this possibility suggested<br/>by Paul Erlich turned out to be the smoothest to my ears.</p><p>5) m9-10  The 4:5 slides upward to 11:14.<br/>This one sounds pretty good to me, but a little too sharp.</p><p>6) m11-12  The 4:5 slides upward to 25:32.<br/>This one definitely sounds too sharp to me,<br/>which would certainly rule out 7:9.</p><p>I&apos;ve asked John Starrett to make an mp3 of this,<br/>so that if you have a lousy soundcard on your computer<br/>(which makes the MIDI sound lousy) the mp3 will at<br/>least sound as good as what I have.  I use a Creative<br/>Labs (i.e., Soundblaster) AWE64Value soundcard, and used<br/>the General MIDI &apos;Choir Ahs&apos; patch.</p><p>Feedback definitely wanted.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

The interval between 81/64 and 3/2 is<br/>32:27. So how well do the two ratios lock? Well, (a) the 32nd harmonic of<br/>one coincides with the 27th harmonic of the other. Not very convincing --<br/>these harmonics are normally very weak. (b) they represent the 32nd and 27th<br/>harmonics of a virtual fundamental created by the brain&apos;s central pitch<br/>processor. Again, not very convincing, as a &quot;best fit&quot; virtual fundamental<br/>treating these as the 6th and 5th harmonics, as well as one treating them as<br/>the 19th and 16th harmonics, would be heard far more strongly.</p><p>Primarily, what matters is the size of the numbers 32 and 27.

Perhaps John has a comment.</p><p>John has already responded to this:</p><p>&gt; [John Link, TD 493.15]<br/>&gt; It sounded pretty good on my guitar, and when I played it<br/>&gt; over the phone for Jerry he thought that I had found the<br/>&gt; third that he has been reporting.</p><p>You should read that whole message; you&apos;d be interested in it.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry, TD 496.5]<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a little difficult to evaluate the target tunings since<br/>&gt; these sustain for only a short time. Would it be convenient<br/>&gt; to add a beat or two to each item to let the target tuning<br/>&gt; sustain a bit longer? Does your software allow<br/>&gt; for this without redoing the whole set up?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I agree with Paul that it would help &quot;fine tune&quot; the<br/>&gt; experiment if the vibrato could be eliminated. &quot;Straight&quot;<br/>&gt; tone is easier to tune (as well as evaluate for tuning).</p><p>That exactly the problem with using MIDI for audio examples<br/>on the wwweb: what you hear on your end when you create the<br/>file is likely to be radically different from what others<br/>hear on their equipment.</p><p>I&apos;ve prolonged each chord for an extra 4 beats, and<br/>changed the patch to General MIDI &apos;English Horn&apos;.  It<br/>still has vibrato, but less than any other appropriate<br/>sound I could find (i.e., excluding organ patches,<br/>which timbre would be totally inappropriate for this<br/>experiment concerning human voices).<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid</a></p><p>&gt; The last two are so high they sound more like sus chords<br/>&gt; than major triads.</p><p>Yes, I agree with that.  Of course context plays a role<br/>here too.  If the 1/1 - 32/25 - 3/2 chord were heard in<br/>a different context, with the &apos;3rd&apos; right on 32/25 rather<br/>than rising from the previous 5/4, it may sound more<br/>like a &apos;major&apos; triad.</p><p>&gt; Certainly the 7:9 third, which sounds nothing like a<br/>&gt; perfect fourth, is not as high as these.</p><p>On the contrary, 7:9 [= ~435 cents] is noticeably higher<br/>(in this context, speaking of intervals, one should really<br/>say &apos;wider&apos;) than both 11:14 [= ~418 cents] and 25:32<br/>[= ~427 cents].</p><p>&gt; There are 7 items on your sound example and only 6 described here.<br/>&gt; What did I miss?</p><p>By the time you heard it, I had already updated it to<br/>include 4:5 rising to 7:9, as requested by John Link<br/>in TD 493.15.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 493.22]<br/>&gt;&gt; Even chords like 14:18:21 might take their place in a<br/>&gt;&gt; new melodic/harmonic vocabulary that is divorced from the<br/>&gt;&gt; familiar styles that have arisen over the last few hundred<br/>&gt;&gt; years (for example, Margo Schulter has suggested using this<br/>&gt;&gt; chord in a Xeno-Gothic context where the major third<br/>&gt;&gt; (in this case tuned 7:9) typically resolves outward into<br/>&gt;&gt; a perfect fifth).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Jerry Eskelin, TD 496.16]<br/>&gt; As in the chromatically adjusted Landini cadence, I presume?<br/>&gt; A historically unique form of &quot;dominant&quot;/tonic progression,<br/>&gt; to be sure. I can imagine the 7:9 third in this context with<br/>&gt; its &quot;raised four&quot; tugging anxiously toward the final chord<br/>&gt; fifth.</p><p>I think this is an excellent example of an historical usage<br/>where 7:9 might be appropriate.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

That&apos;s why I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t put in my two cents about my impressions.</p><p>Unfortunately, as I&apos;ve already noted several times, what<br/>you hear in any MIDI-file is entirely dependent on how your<br/>system is configured.  (This is not the case with .mp3,<br/>.wav, or Real-Audio, where you get what the creator of<br/>the file actually recorded.)</p><p>It sounds to me like your particular problem is that your<br/>pitch-bend settings are not having any effect.</p><p>There are a couple of places on the web where you can<br/>download a very short MIDI-file that you can use to test<br/>your pitch-bend settings.  I think John deLaubenfels&apos;s site<br/>is one, and IIRC Mark Nowitzky&apos;s is another.  To play my<br/>files correctly, you have to make sure that your pitch-bend<br/>is set for 4096 pitch-bend units = 1 semitone.</p><p>&gt; Based on what everybody else has reported, if the 9/7 is<br/>&gt; actually as high as Joe has it</p><p>A 9/7 is as high as it is - it has nothing to do with<br/>what I do or don&apos;t do.  It&apos;s slightly over 435 cents, period,<br/>which makes it a larger interval than any of the other<br/>&apos;high 3rds&apos; in my MIDI-file.</p><p>&gt; then it is probably the case that my guitar experiment<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t quite right, maybe due to old strings with inharmonic<br/>&gt; overtones. Tonight I did the guitar experiment again and<br/>&gt; used my tuning meter to measure the number of cents in the<br/>&gt; interval between 5/4 and 9/7 and between 9/7 and 4/3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are my results:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        9/7 to 4/3 = 65 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        4/5 to 9/7 = 50 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to my copy of Helmholtz the numbers should be<br/>&gt; 63 and 49.</p><p>Here&apos;s an accurate account:</p><p>  (4/3) / (9/7)<br/>= (4/3) * (7/9)<br/>= 28/27<br/>= ~62.96090365398 cents</p><p>In the second example, you meant &apos;5/4 to 9/7&apos;.</p><p>  (9/7) / (5/4)<br/>= (9/7) * (4/5)<br/>= 36/35<br/>= ~48.77038122719 cents</p><p>(Of course, the cents values are non-repeating irrational<br/>decimal numbers, so even taken to 11 decimal places they&apos;re<br/>still approximate, thus the ~ .)</p><p>I don&apos;t know if there are standard accepted names for these<br/>septimal intervals, but they should both be referred to as<br/>types of diesis, one large and one small (or &apos;major&apos; and<br/>&apos;minor&apos; if you prefer).  They pop up all the time in<br/>7-limit JI music.</p><p>&gt; So I conclude that I have correctly tuned 9/7 on my guitar.</p><p>OK, I wasn&apos;t there when you played it, so I can&apos;t argue<br/>with you about that.  But 7:9 is *still* the widest &apos;3rd&apos;<br/>in my experiment, and can be heard clearly as such on<br/>my equipment and on that of others who have responded here.</p><p>&gt; The triad that I formed including the 9/7 clearly does not<br/>&gt; sound like a suspended chord.</p><p>I also can&apos;t argue with that.  Paul Erlich and I have both<br/>noted in this thread that context has a lot to do with<br/>*how* a chord or interval is perceived.</p><p>In this experiment, which I attempted to fashion exactly<br/>the same way Jerry Eskelin explained his observations,<br/>I start from the 4:5 in every case and glissando *up* to<br/>the target &apos;high 3rd&apos;.  Under these conditions, I&apos;m not<br/>surprised that the &apos;high 3rds&apos; that go beyond the 64:81<br/>&apos;Pythagorean 3rd&apos; start sounding like suspended &apos;4ths&apos;.</p><p>As Paul noted, if the target pitch came after a *real*<br/>&apos;4th&apos; (that is, the higher note first, then the lower),<br/>it would very likely be perceived as a &apos;3rd&apos;, even if<br/>it is a very wide one like 7:9.</p><p>I suppose the only way to solve the puzzle once and for<br/>all is for Jerry to have his singers perform the experiment,<br/>and record each note on a separate track of a multi-track<br/>recorder, so that a spectrogram analyzer can be used on<br/>the track with the &apos;high 3rd&apos;.  Then we&apos;ll know *exactly*<br/>what&apos;s going on mathematically.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
