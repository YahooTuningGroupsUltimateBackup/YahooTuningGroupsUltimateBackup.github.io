Thanks to a serendipitous posting to the tuning list,<br/>I followed a link to this festivals&apos; site barely a week before the event,<br/>looked at my calendar to see that it was my only free weekend without paid<br/>gigs for two months, and immediately registered to attend the festival.</p><p>It was a really wonderful festival! The hosts organized a fabulous event.<br/>There were three different workshops, each three hours in length and offered<br/>twice during the three day weekend so you could create your own schedule. So<br/>on Saturday morning I walked a number of blocks to Centre Pierre Peladeau<br/>where I spent much of the next two days.</p><p>The first workshop I attended was Inuit throat singing with two native women<br/>from Nunnavik, Sarah Arnaluk Beaulne and Lydia Etok. They talked for a while<br/>about the history of throat singing and its place in Inuit culture so as to<br/>give us all a contextual understanding of the tradition.  They demonstrated<br/>a number of beautiful pieces in traditional throat singing styles and then<br/>proceeded to teach us some basic techniques. After we practiced for a while<br/>they paired us up so we could try it, and they taught us a traditional song.<br/>They finished out with a few more demonstrations and showed us some modern<br/>&quot;free-style&quot; throat singing. It was a real treat, Sarah and Lydia were very<br/>patient teachers, willing to freely share their knowledge and gifts. They<br/>also laughed quite alot!, expressing the joys of making this music.</p><p>The technique is a bit hard to explain in email text, however the basic<br/>technique is that you sing a vocal tone, then close the throat quickly,<br/>creating a very low guttural sound. Then you sing another tone, then close<br/>again. When done properly, this results in a rhythmic accompaniment to the<br/>melody. They always sing in pairs, one woman sings a melody note while the<br/>other woman makes the low guttural sound, then the reverse. The melodies are<br/>created by interlocking parts, not unlike gamelan music. The two singers<br/>hold each others&apos; arms and sway back in forth, dancing in place, to set up<br/>the rhthm of the song. WOW!</p><p>After a lunch break, I attended a workshop with two Tibetan monks, one of<br/>whom is the chant-master from the Drepung Loseling monastery. He was<br/>accompanied by a translator, as most of us probably didn&apos;t speak Tibetan.<br/>The Tibetan style of teaching is very different from the teaching style of<br/>the west, in a monastery, the chantmaster will simply demonstrate a tone,<br/>and instruct the pupil to replicate it. If the student doesn&apos;t replicate<br/>perfectly, the chant master will sound the tone again. Apparently, this can<br/>go on for a really long time, years if need be, after all, if you&apos;re in the<br/>monastery, you aren&apos;t going anywhere in a hurry.</p><p>The technique was explained that by closing the opening of the throat while<br/>singing a note in your normal pitch range, this creates the low &quot;undertone&quot;<br/>of the drone. The mouth is held in a tight O shape, with the lips extended<br/>out a bit, this amplifies the harmonics. They showed us the technique, then<br/>walked about while we practiced, checking each of us to make sure we were on<br/>the right track. After a bit, I was able to get the low tone, albeit with a<br/>rough edged, raw sound. After a while of practice, and a break, they taught<br/>us the OM-MANI-PAPEP-HUNG chant, and we tried that for a while. Some people<br/>attending seemed disappointed in their teaching style, however I just<br/>accepted it as this is how they teach in the east, and set about to try to<br/>learn it. I found it quite incredible just being in the room with the<br/>Tibetan monks, I don&apos;t have words to express the sound and spiritual aura<br/>that they created everytime they chanted.</p><p>The next morning, on Easter Sunday at 9 AM, I attended a workshop with Steve<br/>Sklar, who teaches the Tuvan khoomei style. Steve is a wonderful, personable<br/>and humorous teacher from Minnesota who has spent much effort deconstructing<br/>the traditional techniques and is thus able to explain how to do them in a<br/>very detailed way, well suited to analytical western minds. He talked for a<br/>while to give us some background of how he learned khoomei, and showed a<br/>short videotape featuring a few performers demonstrating their styles at a<br/>throat singing competition in Tuva in 1995. He talked about the various<br/>styles comprising khoomei, one confusing thing is that khoomei is both the<br/>word for throat singing, and also one of the specific styles of throat<br/>singing.</p><p>First he taught us the basic tone production of the khoomei style, by making<br/>a guttural, croaking sound, then combining this with a vocal pitch in ones&apos;<br/>comfortable normal singing range, you create a harder edged vocal tone that<br/>is rich in harmonics. Then you close your mouth to an O shape, thus enabling<br/>one to sharpen the sound of just one overtone. Moving the extended length of<br/>the full tongue inside the mouth brings out specific pitches in the overtone<br/>series. Quite different than any overtone singing that I had done<br/>previously, where I was doing vowel shapes to bring out different overtones.<br/>In the khoomei style, you don&apos;t use the vowel shapes, except in the kargyraa<br/>style, which he also demonstrated the basic technique. In kargyraa, the low<br/>&quot;undertone&quot; is created in the exact same way as the Tibetan style, however<br/>in Tuvan singing there is much more emphasis on producing the high<br/>overtones. In kargyraa, vowel shapes u-o-ah-ay-ee are used in conjunction<br/>with the low pitch to create melodies. Steve also demonstrated the sygyt<br/>style, but this is pretty advanced, he suggested getting the hang of khoomei<br/>for a while first before moving on to other styles. Needless to say, I am<br/>breaking the rules and trying them all!, particularly the kargyraa style,<br/>which is the one that I am the most enthused about being able to do. Steve<br/>was a tireless instructor, he went almost an hour over the scheduled three<br/>hour time!</p><p>I had not attended the concert of the Tibetan monks the night before, both<br/>nights of that event were sold out, but when I went into the main hallway<br/>after the morning workshop, they were getting ready for the ceremony of<br/>consecrating the mandala out of different colored sands that they had been<br/>working on all weekend. So I stayed for that ceremony, this is where they,<br/>in the spirit of our human impermanence on the planet, undo the mandala,<br/>sweeping all the sand into an urn, which is then cast off into a body of<br/>water... This was accompanied by much chanting, and sounding of instruments.</p><p>Sunday night, after taking a hike in the parc de Mont-Royal for the<br/>wonderful views of Montreal, I attended the final evening performance. It<br/>started with a lecture by Brernard Dubreuil, who was also the organizer of<br/>the entire festival. Although the hour long lecture was in French, and my<br/>abilities in speaking or comprehending the language are limited to short<br/>phrases and incomplete sentences with very questionable pronunciations,<br/>Bernard is one of the best presenters I have heard, in any language. He<br/>beautifully expressed the universal roots of throat singing, from a babys&apos;<br/>cry to a monkeys&apos; screetch, to the chants of the Tibetan lamas. This was<br/>followed by a performance by Steve Sklar demonstrating various styles of<br/>khoomei. There was a wonderful moment while listening where I closed my eyes<br/>and could see wonderful colorful auras.</p><p>After that, the evening was capped by a performance of the Globe-Glotters, a<br/>Montreal based group of throat singers. They combine various styles of<br/>throat singing along with didjeridu, jaws-harp, percussion and tenor banjo.<br/>They are wonderful musicians with a very theatrical and humorous stage<br/>presence. One of my particularly favorite combinations was to hear kargyraa<br/>and didjeridu duets! Hmmm. I&apos;ll have to try this with my music partner.</p><p>Well, it was a truly wonderful event, and of course I ate plenty of<br/>wonderful food while in Montreal. I unfortunately missed connection with a<br/>Montreal based tuning list member, I hope we will meet in person next time I<br/>visit. The only other negative part of the trip was that smoking cigarettes<br/>is rampant in public places in Montreal, and it seems like absolutely<br/>EVERYBODY smokes! (Oh well, reformed ex-smokers such as myself are the worst<br/>kind, aren&apos;t we?). I certainly learned alot in the workshops, a few previous<br/>misconceptions that I had about overtone singing were cleared up, and I met<br/>lots of wonderful people. The Globe Glotters are willing to travel, perhaps<br/>we could organize an event sometime in the New England area, and bring them<br/>stateside.</p><p>Bye for now, I&apos;m back to practicing my throat singing some more!</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p><p>&quot;Music is far, far older than our species.
