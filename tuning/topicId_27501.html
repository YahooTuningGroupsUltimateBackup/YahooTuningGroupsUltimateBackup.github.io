This would be &quot;microtonal&quot; by just about any 20th-century<br/>definition.</p><p>Since &quot;31-note keyboard&quot; might for some people imply specifically a system<br/>of 31-tET as formulated as Huygens near the end of the 17th century, I<br/>would explain that my remarks here focus on an earlier 31-note tradition<br/>based on a division of each whole-tone into five conceptually equal parts,<br/>but quite possibly accomplished in practice using 1/4-comma meantone to<br/>obtain a circulating (but not mathematically precisely equal or<br/>closed) system.</p><p>In the 16th century, Vicentino was criticized by writers such as Vincenzo<br/>Galilei for his use of the enharmonic diesis, an interval Galilei regards<br/>as contrary to the &quot;nature&quot; of the human voice or ear.</p><p>Both Vicentino and Colonna give examples of music using these fifthtone<br/>steps, and sometimes involving new types of vertical as well as melodic<br/>intervals such Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate minor third&quot; or neutral third, for<br/>which he gives an approximate ratio of 11:9, and finds rather consonant.</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s keyboard could also be used for adaptive JI, his first<br/>tuning in a cycle of 31 fifthtones is meant for enharmonic music -- read<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; in 20th-century terms. The revival of the Greek enharmonic<br/>genus, with a semitone divided into two melodic steps, is a major theme of<br/>his treatise, and of the examples of enharmonic music (including a<br/>complete Latin setting in praise of his patron).</p><p>Colonna&apos;s keyboard is likewise intended for enharmonic music, with<br/>examples of things like a &quot;sliding of the voice&quot; through sucessive<br/>fifthtones. He divides the octave into 31 conceptually equal parts, and<br/>makes no mention of any alternative adaptive JI tuning for the instrument,<br/>unlike Vicentino.</p><p>Thus I would say that 31-note keyboards of the era 1550-1620 or so are<br/>specifically intended for what would in later terms be called<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; music.</p><p>The intentions of a 31-note advocate like Huygens, closer to Bach&apos;s era,<br/>may be another question; but I wanted to clarify that the 31-note<br/>keyboards of the Manneristic era around 1540-1640 are intended<br/>specifically for using intervals smaller than a semitone, and also<br/>sometimes for new sonorities involving vertical intervals such as<br/>Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate minor&quot; or neutral thirds.</p><p>Please forgive me if I misread any of the comments that suggested to me<br/>this response, and again I would emphasize that my purpose here is to<br/>explain the early &quot;enharmonic&quot; orientation of 31-note keyboards, not to<br/>express an opinion on the viewpoints which may have prevailed by Bach&apos;s<br/>era.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
