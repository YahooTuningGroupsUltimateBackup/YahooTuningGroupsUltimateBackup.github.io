In the article, you talk about values for<br/>[2 0 0], [0 2 0] and [0 0 2]. I&apos;ll need to take second to work out the<br/>values for [1 0 0], [0 1 0], and [0 0 1] before I can really grasp<br/>this space. Do you have an intuitive way of looking at the coordinates<br/>of this space? The formula</p><p>&quot;If [a b c] is any triple of integers, then it represents the major<br/>tetrad with root 3^((-a+b+c)/2) 5^((a-b+c)/2) 7^((a+b-c)/2) if a+b+c<br/>is even, and the minor tetrad with root 3^((-1-a+b+c)/2)<br/>5^((1+a-b+c)/2 7^((1+a+b-c)/2) if a+b+c is odd.&quot;</p><p>isn&apos;t at all intuitive for me to think about, although maybe I&apos;ll see<br/>a pattern eventually. BTW, is that supposed to be a -1 in the exponent<br/>for 3? It breaks the pattern...</p><p>&gt; The L1 (taxicab) norm of the tetrad [1 0 -5] is 1+0+5 = 6.

And I&apos;m also not sure what the L1 norm of this space means -<br/>does it end up meaning chord movements that move by 3, 5, and/or 7? I<br/>note that when you add up (-a+b+c)/2, (a-b+c)/2, and (a+b-c)/2, you<br/>get a+b+c, but I&apos;m still not sure if I have the right concept.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2011 8:58:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I guess this subspace is going to be a 3d space then, and it&apos;s going<br/>&gt; to be at a 45 degree angle to the axes.</p><p>&quot;This subspace&quot; = ?</p><p> When you say each<br/>&gt; octave-equivalency interval class is represented once, you mean that<br/>&gt; 7/2, 7/4, 7/2, etc all get one representative member?</p><p>Right: they all are represented by |-1 0 0 1&gt; = 7/2.</p><p>Is this all<br/>&gt; basically how to formalize what Petr was doing by just dropping the 2<br/>&gt; exponent from the monzo?</p><p>Don&apos;t know what ypu mean, sorry.</p><p>&gt; Should that first one say |-x-y-z x y z&gt; instead of |-x-y-z z y z&gt;?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>&gt; BTW, is that supposed to be a -1 in the exponent<br/>&gt; for 3?
