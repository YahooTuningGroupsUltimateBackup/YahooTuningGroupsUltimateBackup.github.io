These scale often fall through the crack of the other scales.<br/>I still have not seen reproductions of any of the scales found in the keyboard mappings found in the early xenharmonikons , especially those at the end of vol 3. by other methods despite their simplicity<br/>To take a set of predetermined number of scale tones and using the mapping template as to how and where different to fill out a scale of one own is a rewarding experience that involves much less math and with a hands on approach to building an actual scale that one can hear in the process of putting it together.<br/>While unison vector omit distinctions between accumulated ratio, this simple method allow often at a certain key point two alternatives to which note one would like to use. The making of  such a decision at a key point become often an artistic desicion that has implications for the scale that one will be using. One can always go back and change a particular scale point also. I think thereris allot to be said about how we get our scales as much as the final result. Short cuts can be deceiving<br/>Obviously different methods produce different results which is there value. In this case it is the process also that is important to actually understanding what tones one has and can choose.</p><p>This paper  <a href="http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF</a><br/>shows him using two different staring points from which to  extend a generator. page 10 showing variations of the size of the neutral third according to ones wishes (allows for regional fluctuation) .</p><p>In a different way his Helixsongs use the duel generator idea in a different way as the generators are two harmonic series. also one has the diaphonic cycles in his treasure chest</p><p>Message: 9<br/>Date: Thu, 26 May 2005 06:36:44 -0000<br/>From: &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@bigpond.net.au">d.keenan@bigpond.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: question about just intonation scales</p><p>Paul Erlich pointed out that there _are_ proper scales which are not<br/>CS, such as 8 notes in a chain of just minor thirds.</p><p>So CS is neither a stronger nor weaker condition than propriety.</p><p>This usage of &quot;weaker&quot; does not imply any inferiority, only greater<br/>inclusiveness.</p><p>Paul also pointed out that all MOS/DE scales are also CS but not<br/>necessarily the other way &apos;round, so in that sense CS is a weaker<br/>condition than MOS/DE.

Unfortunately he did not address the question at all<br/>in his reply.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
