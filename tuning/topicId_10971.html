I remember once reading<br/>that the Russian film director Vsevolod Pudovkin conducted some<br/>experiments were he filmed an expressionless close-up of an actor and<br/>then spliced the same shot so that it would follow footage of a plate<br/>of soup, a young girl lying dead in her coffin, and of a child at<br/>play. He then showed the finished print to an audience who had to tell<br/>what they had seen. They all noticed how the actor gazed hungrily at<br/>the soup, sadly at the death scene, and happily at the child... yet<br/>they had all seen the same impassive face each time.</p><p>&gt; This process, of course, happens frequently in composition, as<br/>everybody knows.  One thinks one has something, and then coming back<br/>to it again in another day or night, one finds out it is entirely<br/>something else... or at least it is PERCEIVED as something else</p><p>Yes, I frequently have this sort of &quot;problem.&quot; But it&apos;s not so much a<br/>case of one thing sounding like a different thing after coming back to<br/>it cold, but more that somethings that I think I&apos;ve finally got my ear<br/>wrapped around at the end of one day ends up sounding like complete<br/>and utter bedlam the next day! However this is almost always just a<br/>temporary trauma that a good fifteen minutes of getting back in the<br/>flow of things usually conquers.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
