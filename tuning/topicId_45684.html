The contemporary reports<br/>on Mahler&apos;s conducting, as you know, were that he had a &quot;bad beat&quot; -- I think that<br/>just means he was tweaking the tempo within the bar, which players didn&apos;t like.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; and Mahler himself said that if the music is too complex<br/>&gt; for the acoustics of the hall to allow the different<br/>&gt; polyphonic lines to be heard distinctly, then the<br/>&gt; tempo is too fast and must be slowed down.</p><p>That&apos;s surely true as well, but how slow is too slow?

I<br/>think when you work on a piece so long the tendency is to want to slow it down so<br/>that you can appreciate every nuance you&apos;ve discovered along the way-- it&apos;s hard to<br/>recapture the experience of what it&apos;s like to hear the 7th for the first time.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; i simply can no longer accept what i feel are the<br/>&gt; typical &quot;rushed&quot; performances of this piece.</p><p>Boulez is definitely rushed, but it works for the Nachtmusik movements, which can<br/>really drag. Most other recordings I actually find too slow!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; i think the notorious length of<br/>&gt; Mahler&apos;s symphonies is generally *shorter* than it<br/>&gt; *should* be!     ;-)</p><p>Do you know the &quot;Gothic Symphony&quot; of Havergal Brian.

Brass<br/>&gt; &gt; definitely sound best in just but the late 19th<br/>&gt; &gt; century modifications to the instruments do place<br/>&gt; &gt; the  &apos;center&apos; of the pitch closer to 12tet (that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; an oversimplification, of course).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; how interesting that you should be writing just now<br/>&gt; about the intonation of the brass instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; before i read your post this morning, i finally<br/>&gt; sat down and calculated the theoretical intonation<br/>&gt; of the standard valved trumpet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this is something i&apos;ve been wanting to know for<br/>&gt; years, and just never gave enough thought to it<br/>&gt; to figure out exactly how it worked.  and i&apos;ve<br/>&gt; never seen anything like this published anywhere<br/>&gt; either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; my source (Christopher W. Monk, &quot;The Older Brass<br/>&gt; Instruments: Cornett, Trombone, Trumpet&quot;, chapter 11<br/>&gt; of _Musical Instruments Through The Ages_, ed.<br/>&gt; Anthony Baines, 1973 reprint of 1969 3rd edition)<br/>&gt; says that the valves lower the pitch of the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; harmonics available on the trumpet, by adding extra<br/>&gt; lengths of tubing as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1st valve = 1/8 of the main tube<br/>&gt; 2nd valve = 1/15 of the main tube<br/>&gt; 3rd valve = 1/5 of the main tube<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this mechanism obviously has a JI basis, so that<br/>&gt; the 1st valve lowers the pitch by a 9:8 ratio<br/>&gt; (-~204 cents = &quot;2 semitones&quot;), the 2nd by a 16:15<br/>&gt; (-~112 cents = &quot;1 semitone&quot;), and the 3rd by a 6:5<br/>&gt; (-~316 cents = &quot;3 semitones&quot;).</p><p>Monz, at best these are approximations.  (Also see my next comment,<br/>below.)</p><p>&gt; but as Monk points out (describing it differently,<br/>&gt; but it means the same as what i say here), these<br/>&gt; ratios only apply when the player uses a *single*<br/>&gt; valve.  when 2 or 3 are used in combination, the<br/>&gt; ratios become much more complex, as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   valves      ratio   ~cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1 and 2      143:120   -304<br/>&gt; 1 and 3       53:40    -487<br/>&gt; 2 and 3       95:75    -409<br/>&gt; 1, 2, and 3  167:120   -572</p><p>The first and third valves on most trumpets have trigger mechanisms<br/>attached to the valve tubing that allow the player to move the slides<br/>outward and back in on the fly, effectively lengthening the overall<br/>tube length in order to compensate for the error (or shortfall)<br/>resulting from valves used in combination.  The amount of pitch<br/>adjustment possible is not much more than a comma, so this technique<br/>is not extremely useful for producing microtones.</p><p>&gt; so i calculated all of the notes which are available<br/>&gt; by lowering the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th<br/>&gt; natural harmonics of the trumpet.  making &quot;C&quot; the<br/>&gt; beginning of each ascending 8ve and designating<br/>&gt; &quot;middle-C&quot; as C4, these are respectively the notes<br/>&gt; C4, G4, C5, E5, G5, Bb&lt;5, and C6 (&quot;high-C&quot;).</p><p>Brass players normally avoid the 7th (and 11th, 13th, etc.) harmonic<br/>since it is regarded as being &quot;out of tune.&quot;</p><p>&gt; (i&apos;m using the &quot;less-than&quot; sign as per my 72edo HEWM<br/>&gt; notation, to indicate the ~31 cent lowering of the<br/>&gt; 7th harmonic from the 12edo Bb.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; these are the notes as written for the trumpet.<br/>&gt; for the standard Bb trumpet, the actual sounding<br/>&gt; pitch will be one &quot;whole-step&quot; lower, and for the<br/>&gt; small F trumpet, a &quot;perfect-4th&quot; higher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; one last _caveat_: the way the player uses his lips<br/>&gt; has a *tremendous* affect on trumpet intonation.<br/>&gt; these cents-values are only theoretical, and may<br/>&gt; vary widely.  also, i know nothing about variabilities<br/>&gt; of tube-length for the valves among different makes<br/>&gt; and models of trumpet.</p><p>Yes, adjustments in lip tension (embouchure) and also the position of<br/>the back part of the tongue (which changes the size of the player&apos;s<br/>mouth cavity) may also be used in order to adjust intonation, and the<br/>amount of adjustment possible is greater than with valve slide (or<br/>trigger) adjustments.  However, embouchure adjustments also affect<br/>tone quality, and as you would suspect, the greater the adjustment,<br/>the greater the deterioration in quality and the greater the amount<br/>of skill required to control the tone.  So if you want microtones,<br/>this technique also has limitations.</p><p>Being a brass player (among other things), I&apos;ve been thinking about<br/>the problem of microtones on valved brass instruments for quite a<br/>long time, and many years ago I came to the conclusion that having<br/>instruments specially built to play in multiple tunings would<br/>ultimately be the best way to go.</p><p>A spreadsheet, which I made for Patrick Ozzard-Low, gives a valve<br/>plan for 21st-century (microtonal) valved brass instruments, and it<br/>may be seen here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/Brass.xls">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/Brass.xls</a></p><p>A few words of explanation are in order.</p><p>1) My plan for valved brass instruments involves only equal divisions<br/>of the octave for the simple reason that the advantages of<br/>temperaments far outweigh the limitations when one considers<br/>instruments of flexible pitch -- and my valve plan accommodates<br/>divisions up to 41-ET, so the distinction of a comma may be made.</p><p>2) I have added a fourth valve that is operated by the thumb rather<br/>than the little finger.  For 26-ET and up this is to be a 3-position<br/>valve, with the rest position at the center of travel.  Bending the<br/>thumb lowers the pitch by 1 system degree, and unbending the thumb<br/>(from the rest position) *raises* the pitch by 1 system degree.<br/>There are several benefits resulting from this arrangement:</p><p>a) The thumb has greater strength and independence than the little<br/>finger, making microtonal fingering easier to execute;</p><p>b) A 3-position valve offers more valve combinations than a 2-<br/>position valve, so more tones in the octave are possible;</p><p>c) For divisions up to 36-ET the first and second-finger valves are<br/>allowed to retain the same function that they have in a conventional<br/>instrument (i.e., lowering by a major and minor 2nd, respectively),<br/>so that many conventional fingerings are retained, resulting in a<br/>much gentler learning curve;</p><p>d) For instruments (such as the tuba and piccolo trumpet) that<br/>require enough valve combinations to fill out the range between the<br/>fundamental and 2nd harmonic (i.e., an entire octave), an additional<br/>valve could be operated by the little finger (and is included in my<br/>spreadsheet).</p><p>3) A compensating mechanism is intended to be employed when the 3rd<br/>valve is used in combination with other valves, which brings into<br/>play a second (longer) set of slide tubing that corrects most of the<br/>shortfall in length.  (My spreadsheet gives the error in cents for<br/>each valve combination in each division.)</p><p>4) For the larger divisions the thumb valve must need to alter the<br/>pitch by a relatively small amount.

Brass<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; definitely sound best in just but the late 19th<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; century modifications to the instruments do place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the  &apos;center&apos; of the pitch closer to 12tet (that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an oversimplification, of course).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; how interesting that you should be writing just now<br/>&gt; &gt; about the intonation of the brass instruments.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; before i read your post this morning, i finally<br/>&gt; &gt; sat down and calculated the theoretical intonation<br/>&gt; &gt; of the standard valved trumpet.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; this is something i&apos;ve been wanting to know for<br/>&gt; &gt; years, and just never gave enough thought to it<br/>&gt; &gt; to figure out exactly how it worked.  and i&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; never seen anything like this published anywhere<br/>&gt; &gt; either.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; my source (Christopher W. Monk, &quot;The Older Brass<br/>&gt; &gt; Instruments: Cornett, Trombone, Trumpet&quot;, chapter 11<br/>&gt; &gt; of _Musical Instruments Through The Ages_, ed.<br/>&gt; &gt; Anthony Baines, 1973 reprint of 1969 3rd edition)<br/>&gt; &gt; says that the valves lower the pitch of the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonics available on the trumpet, by adding extra<br/>&gt; &gt; lengths of tubing as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1st valve = 1/8 of the main tube<br/>&gt; &gt; 2nd valve = 1/15 of the main tube<br/>&gt; &gt; 3rd valve = 1/5 of the main tube<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; this mechanism obviously has a JI basis, so that<br/>&gt; &gt; the 1st valve lowers the pitch by a 9:8 ratio<br/>&gt; &gt; (-~204 cents = &quot;2 semitones&quot;), the 2nd by a 16:15<br/>&gt; &gt; (-~112 cents = &quot;1 semitone&quot;), and the 3rd by a 6:5<br/>&gt; &gt; (-~316 cents = &quot;3 semitones&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz, at best these are approximations.  (Also see my next comment,<br/>&gt; below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but as Monk points out (describing it differently,<br/>&gt; &gt; but it means the same as what i say here), these<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios only apply when the player uses a *single*<br/>&gt; &gt; valve.  when 2 or 3 are used in combination, the<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios become much more complex, as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   valves      ratio   ~cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 and 2      143:120   -304<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 and 3       53:40    -487<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 and 3       95:75    -409<br/>&gt; &gt; 1, 2, and 3  167:120   -572<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first and third valves on most trumpets have trigger mechanisms<br/>&gt; attached to the valve tubing that allow the player to move the slides<br/>&gt; outward and back in on the fly, effectively lengthening the overall<br/>&gt; tube length in order to compensate for the error (or shortfall)<br/>&gt; resulting from valves used in combination.  The amount of pitch<br/>&gt; adjustment possible is not much more than a comma, so this technique<br/>&gt; is not extremely useful for producing microtones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so i calculated all of the notes which are available<br/>&gt; &gt; by lowering the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th<br/>&gt; &gt; natural harmonics of the trumpet.  making &quot;C&quot; the<br/>&gt; &gt; beginning of each ascending 8ve and designating<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;middle-C&quot; as C4, these are respectively the notes<br/>&gt; &gt; C4, G4, C5, E5, G5, Bb&lt;5, and C6 (&quot;high-C&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Brass players normally avoid the 7th (and 11th, 13th, etc.) harmonic<br/>&gt; since it is regarded as being &quot;out of tune.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (i&apos;m using the &quot;less-than&quot; sign as per my 72edo HEWM<br/>&gt; &gt; notation, to indicate the ~31 cent lowering of the<br/>&gt; &gt; 7th harmonic from the 12edo Bb.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; these are the notes as written for the trumpet.<br/>&gt; &gt; for the standard Bb trumpet, the actual sounding<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch will be one &quot;whole-step&quot; lower, and for the<br/>&gt; &gt; small F trumpet, a &quot;perfect-4th&quot; higher.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; one last _caveat_: the way the player uses his lips<br/>&gt; &gt; has a *tremendous* affect on trumpet intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt; these cents-values are only theoretical, and may<br/>&gt; &gt; vary widely.  also, i know nothing about variabilities<br/>&gt; &gt; of tube-length for the valves among different makes<br/>&gt; &gt; and models of trumpet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, adjustments in lip tension (embouchure) and also the position of<br/>&gt; the back part of the tongue (which changes the size of the player&apos;s<br/>&gt; mouth cavity) may also be used in order to adjust intonation, and the<br/>&gt; amount of adjustment possible is greater than with valve slide (or<br/>&gt; trigger) adjustments.  However, embouchure adjustments also affect<br/>&gt; tone quality, and as you would suspect, the greater the adjustment,<br/>&gt; the greater the deterioration in quality and the greater the amount<br/>&gt; of skill required to control the tone.  So if you want microtones,<br/>&gt; this technique also has limitations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Being a brass player (among other things), I&apos;ve been thinking about<br/>&gt; the problem of microtones on valved brass instruments for quite a<br/>&gt; long time, and many years ago I came to the conclusion that having<br/>&gt; instruments specially built to play in multiple tunings would<br/>&gt; ultimately be the best way to go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A spreadsheet, which I made for Patrick Ozzard-Low, gives a valve<br/>&gt; plan for 21st-century (microtonal) valved brass instruments, and it<br/>&gt; may be seen here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/Brass.xls">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/Brass.xls</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few words of explanation are in order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) My plan for valved brass instruments involves only equal divisions<br/>&gt; of the octave for the simple reason that the advantages of<br/>&gt; temperaments far outweigh the limitations when one considers<br/>&gt; instruments of flexible pitch -- and my valve plan accommodates<br/>&gt; divisions up to 41-ET, so the distinction of a comma may be made.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) I have added a fourth valve that is operated by the thumb rather<br/>&gt; than the little finger.  For 26-ET and up this is to be a 3-position<br/>&gt; valve, with the rest position at the center of travel.  Bending the<br/>&gt; thumb lowers the pitch by 1 system degree, and unbending the thumb<br/>&gt; (from the rest position) *raises* the pitch by 1 system degree.<br/>&gt; There are several benefits resulting from this arrangement:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a) The thumb has greater strength and independence than the little<br/>&gt; finger, making microtonal fingering easier to execute;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; b) A 3-position valve offers more valve combinations than a 2-<br/>&gt; position valve, so more tones in the octave are possible;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; c) For divisions up to 36-ET the first and second-finger valves are<br/>&gt; allowed to retain the same function that they have in a conventional<br/>&gt; instrument (i.e., lowering by a major and minor 2nd, respectively),<br/>&gt; so that many conventional fingerings are retained, resulting in a<br/>&gt; much gentler learning curve;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; d) For instruments (such as the tuba and piccolo trumpet) that<br/>&gt; require enough valve combinations to fill out the range between the<br/>&gt; fundamental and 2nd harmonic (i.e., an entire octave), an additional<br/>&gt; valve could be operated by the little finger (and is included in my<br/>&gt; spreadsheet).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) A compensating mechanism is intended to be employed when the 3rd<br/>&gt; valve is used in combination with other valves, which brings into<br/>&gt; play a second (longer) set of slide tubing that corrects most of the<br/>&gt; shortfall in length.  (My spreadsheet gives the error in cents for<br/>&gt; each valve combination in each division.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) For the larger divisions the thumb valve must need to alter the<br/>&gt; pitch by a relatively small amount.  Since there is a practical limit<br/>&gt; on how little tubing can be added by a conventional valve, the thumb<br/>&gt; valve mechanism will instead *swap* lengths of tubing, so that the<br/>&gt; pitch alteration is determined by the *difference* in length between<br/>&gt; the valve slides employed for each position, so that there is no<br/>&gt; limitation to how small the pitch alteration can be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5) In order to convert the instrument from one tuning to another, it<br/>&gt; would be a simple matter to adjust or swap out lengths of valve<br/>&gt; tubing, so the player would need only a single instrument to play in<br/>&gt; many different tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6) As an alternative to a 3-position thumb valve, it would probably<br/>&gt; be less expensive to think analog rather than digital by giving the<br/>&gt; thumb the ability to control the position of a second tuning slide<br/>&gt; for continuously variable adjustment of pitch.  This could also<br/>&gt; eliminate the necessity (and expense) of a 3rd-valve compensating<br/>&gt; mechanism by also allowing fine adjustments in pitch at the player&apos;s<br/>&gt; discretion.

Building a multi-tuning microtonal trumpet in the<br/>key of C would not only make it simpler for JI, but would also<br/>eliminate the considerable inconvenience (or should I say nightmare)<br/>of having to contend with a microtonal transposing instrument, as<br/>well as making it easier to play notes in the upper range.  The<br/>slight difference in tone could be compensated for by a redesign of<br/>the bore of the instrument.  The trumpet would lose a whole step from<br/>the bottom of its range, but this would be alleviated by the<br/>following point.</p><p>8) The function of the 3rd valve in my plan (not only for the<br/>trumpet, but for all valved brass) differs from conventional practice<br/>in that it would lower the pitch by a *major third* rather than a<br/>minor third, thus restoring half of the lower range that is lost by<br/>building a trumpet in C instead of B-flat.  And more range is<br/>restored when it is realized that there is yet a thumb valve that<br/>will lower the pitch still further (making the effective loss of<br/>range only a quartertone).</p><p>There is an additional reason for changing the function of the 3rd<br/>valve.  In a 5-valve instrument (see point 2d, above) the 4th-finger<br/>valve would lower by a minor sixth, so having the 3rd-finger valve<br/>lower by a major third provides a continuous sequence of tones in<br/>more divisions of the octave.  For the sake of uniformity among the<br/>entire microtonal brass family, I believe that it would be desirable<br/>that the 3rd valve have the same function regardless of the total<br/>number of valves in any particular instrument.</p><p>9) Mention of the French horn in the above quote reminds me that this<br/>instrument requires special treatment.  The conventional double horn<br/>is a 4-valve instrument, the 4th valve being operated by the thumb to<br/>*raise* the pitch a *fourth*, with a compensating mechanism (see<br/>point 3 above) in the form of a double set of valve slides for the<br/>other 3 valves).  A microtonal instrument built according to the plan<br/>in my spreadsheet would necessitate rebuilding the instrument in such<br/>a way that the thumb valve (along with its compensating mechanism) be<br/>moved to a position where it will be operated by the 3rd finger, with<br/>its function changed so that it *lowers* the pitch by a *major<br/>third*.  With this new 3rd valve depressed, the horn would produce a<br/>harmonic series in F.  Thus, with no valves depressed, the harmonic<br/>series would be in A (a minor second lower than the conventional B-<br/>flat horn).  The thumb would then be available to operate a 3-<br/>position valve that would alter up or down by a single system<br/>degree.  An additional hand-stopping valve would be provided for the<br/>little finger that would add the specific amount of tubing necessary<br/>to correct the change in pitch that occurs when the horn is<br/>played &quot;stopped.&quot;</p><p>Having been a horn player myself, I am well aware that some<br/>significant adjustments in fingering habits would be necessary in<br/>order to play a microtonal instrument such as this, but I have tried<br/>to achieve a balance between the changes required for both the player<br/>and the instrument.  As with the other brass, the 1st and 2nd valves<br/>would keep their present function, so that the player would<br/>immediately be able to use those two valves for the present &quot;F-horn&quot;<br/>fingerings (except that they would be used in conjunction with the<br/>3rd valve depressed) to arrive at the present &quot;F-horn&quot; tube length,<br/>thus (hopefully) approaching an ideal &quot;F-horn sound.&quot;</p><p>--George Secor</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2003 12:22:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;7) To rephrase the problem of achieving just intonation on brass<br/>&gt;instruments, it&apos;s unfortunate that brass instruments are pitched<br/>&gt;most often in B-flat.

I did a double-take the first time I had<br/>a horn in F and had to play a part written for E-flat horn.  As it<br/>turned out, I was able to sight-read the part easily, but only<br/>because I have absolute pitch and, after quickly analyzing the<br/>situation, realized that I could read the part as if it were written<br/>for a &quot;C&quot; instrument in bass clef, playing the pitches an octave<br/>higher and adding 3 flats to the key signature.</p><p>This was possible for me only because I play the horn as if it were a<br/>non-transposing instrument.  When I first took up the horn, I<br/>realized that there was no way that my mind was going to accept a<br/>pitch as &quot;C&quot; when I am hearing &quot;F&quot;.  That&apos;s sheer insanity, like<br/>asking someone to transpose colors, accepting green as red, and red<br/>as blue, and blue as green.  For this problem there was a simple<br/>solution: as I learned to play the horn, I also learned to read F<br/>horn parts in the mezzo-soprano clef (with middle C on the 2nd<br/>line).  I later met another horn player with absolute pitch, and I<br/>was pleasantly surprised to discover that he read horn parts in<br/>exactly the same way (including the E-flat parts).</p><p>Likewise, when I played the bass clarinet in high school, I read the<br/>parts as if they were in the tenor clef and added 2 flats to the key<br/>signature.</p><p>I can read 5 clefs in all, and since I treat each instrument as a &quot;C&quot;<br/>instrument, I am able to sight-read a part written for any instrument<br/>on whatever instrument I happen to be playing (assuming that the part<br/>is within a reasonable range and not beyond my technical<br/>capability).

It&apos;s already standard practice for bass-clef<br/>parts (e.g., tubas are commonly made in B-flat, C, and E-flat, but<br/>all tuba parts are in &quot;C&quot;), so why shouldn&apos;t everyone else follow<br/>suit, at least in the microtonal realm?</p><p>&gt; &gt;The slight difference in tone could be compensated for by a<br/>&gt; &gt;redesign of the bore of the instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?

I consider this far more valuable than the<br/>convenience<br/>&gt; &gt; of learning a single set of fingerings to play, for example, both<br/>E-<br/>&gt; &gt; flat and B-flat saxophones, or B-flat and A clarinets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perfect pitch sure sounds crippling! :)</p><p>I think that the term &quot;absolute pitch&quot; or, better yet, &quot;tonal memory&quot;<br/>more accurately describes the ability commonly referred to<br/>as &quot;perfect pitch&quot; (after all, nobody&apos;s perfect).  Yes, it can be a<br/>handicap under certain circumstances, but I never regret having<br/>developed it.  (Yes I had to work at it to acquire it, which makes me<br/>suspect that it&apos;s not entirely (or even necessarily) dependent on<br/>genetics -- more about that below.)  It makes such things as playing<br/>by ear, sight-singing, or following the modulations in a classical<br/>recording almost effortless.  When, as a piano student, I had to<br/>learn all of the major and minor scales, I found that it was<br/>unnecessary to memorize anything other than which fingers to start<br/>with, because I could already &quot;hear&quot; all of the notes in my head.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think these instruments were designed<br/>&gt; with perfect pitch in mind. Actually, it might have been better in<br/>the long run if you<br/>&gt; had taken the leap of faith and accepted a written C for any<br/>transposed pitch. This<br/>&gt; might be difficult at first but the brain can learn to do the<br/>substitutions in a short<br/>&gt; while--then you&apos;d have perfect pitch in any transposition!</p><p>Even assuming that I could do 11 different substitutions without<br/>getting overly confused, this all breaks down once I go microtonal.<br/>With multitudes of tunings and a whole continuum of possible<br/>intervals (not to mention pitch standards), how many more<br/>substitutions would there be, and where would they end?</p><p>&gt; What would you do if you<br/>&gt; had to play a harpsichord tuned to A415?</p><p>Here&apos;s the answer I typed immediately after reading your question:</p><p>&lt;&lt; I guess I would have to try to think in two different keys at<br/>once, and with a little practice I could probably pull it off.  The<br/>real problem here is with the keyboard:  If the harpsichord had a<br/>Bosanquet generalized keyboard, there would be no problem at all,<br/>because the fingering patterns are the same in all keys. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I had a chance Sunday evening to experiment with an electronic piano<br/>that has a key-transpose feature.  Using the harpsichord timbre, I<br/>set the pitch down 1/2 step and found, much to my surprise, that I<br/>had no trouble at all playing a couple of fairly difficult (but<br/>familiar) pieces of music if I had the printed page in front of me.<br/>Trying to play from memory was a little more difficult, but I found<br/>that my mind was able to interpret the pitches as being (to use an<br/>astronomer&apos;s term for observing far-off objects as they were in the<br/>distant past) red-shifted in frequency so I could think of a lowered<br/>C, for example, as a flat C rather than a C-flat (or B).  (Also<br/>relevant to this is my observation below about pitch perception<br/>tolerance.)</p><p>I then reset the pitch another 1/2 step down and found that, while my<br/>mind would not accept a B-flat as a C, I could still play music that<br/>I was reading without any trouble.  Just for fun, I tried the worst-<br/>case scenario and put the instrument into the key of F-sharp, and<br/>again, to my utter amazement, I had no problem playing the piece, as<br/>long as I had the music in front of me.  I had to rely mostly on what<br/>athletes call &quot;muscle memory&quot; to pull it off, but hearing the sound<br/>in a completely different key didn&apos;t interfere at all with my<br/>concentration.</p><p>I found that playing from memory was more difficult, because I<br/>memorize music by memorizing the sounds, so without the music in<br/>front of me, only the half-step-down transposition was trouble-free.<br/>Even more difficult than playing a piece from memory was trying to<br/>improvise on a transposed keyboard; again, only the half-step-down<br/>transposition gave me no trouble.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For microtonal instruments I would therefore prefer to see all<br/>scores<br/>&gt; &gt; and parts as if they were written for instruments pitched in &quot;C&quot;<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; have players learn the fingerings for their instruments so as to<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; able to read those parts.  That way, any player could sight-read<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; part written for another microtonal instrument, making<br/>instrumental<br/>&gt; &gt; substitutions a snap.  It&apos;s already standard practice for bass-<br/>clef<br/>&gt; &gt; parts (e.g., tubas are commonly made in B-flat, C, and E-flat,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; all tuba parts are in &quot;C&quot;), so why shouldn&apos;t everyone else follow<br/>&gt; &gt; suit, at least in the microtonal realm?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The C-standard is becoming more normal, but a lot of players aren&apos;t<br/>actually learning<br/>&gt; new fingerings, but just transposing in their head.</p><p>My experience of singing in choirs that suddenly drift off pitch<br/>(always downward, and I can&apos;t remember a single instance where it was<br/>due to comma drift) has occasionally made it necessary for me to<br/>transpose a part downward by a half-step, which took a certain amount<br/>of effort.  But I imagine that mastering the technique takes about<br/>the same amount of practice as learning a new clef.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; PS- Do you have bucket perfect pitch (all notes classified as<br/>nearest 12edo note) or<br/>&gt; continuous perfect pitch (very fine microtonal processing of tone)?</p><p>I would have to call it a combination of the two.</p><p>I developed the ability (which I prefer to call &quot;tonal memory&quot;) as a<br/>6-year-old accordion student.  I observed that I was able to remember<br/>the pitch &quot;A&quot; before even knowing what its name was.  Thinking that<br/>it might be useful, I then proceeded to memorize the pitches of all<br/>the white keys.</p><p>I remember one day my father picked up the instrument and was trying<br/>to pick out a melody on it.  At one point he failed to locate the<br/>desired note, so I pointed out the key he was looking for.  When he<br/>asked how I knew that was the correct one, I explained that I had<br/>memorized what they all sounded like, and he promptly had me turn my<br/>back to him to demonstrate that I could easily identify one after<br/>another.  When he played a black key, however, I drew a blank and<br/>could only say that it must be a black key, because I couldn&apos;t<br/>identify it.</p><p>As time went by my tonal memory underwent further development by my<br/>memorization of samples of pitches in various timbres (by my<br/>listening repeatedly to a number of classical recordings), which had<br/>the effect of generalizing my concept of each pitch.  Within a couple<br/>of years I began piano lessons.  My practice piano was not tuned very<br/>often, and the experience of repeatedly hearing (over many years)<br/>piano tones that were slightly below the proper pitch (I would guess<br/>about 20 to 25 cents, perhaps 30 cents at most) gave me a much larger<br/>downward than upward range or tolerance within which I would readily<br/>identify a pitch with a certain note-name.</p><p>Once I began experimenting with microtones, from time to time I made<br/>tape recordings of some of my improvisations, initially on a retuned<br/>electronic organ and eventually on my Motorola Scalatron, and I found<br/>that I was memorizing pitches after repeated listenings.  I never<br/>made any special effort to do this; it just happens as a matter of<br/>course if I listen repeatedly to recordings.  So I don&apos;t have a fine<br/>microtonal processing of tone, but I&apos;m reasonably confident that I<br/>could memorize the pitches of any particular tonal system to any<br/>particular pitch standard if I took the time and effort to do it.</p><p>I should dispel one common misconception about tonal memory, which is<br/>due to the term &quot;perfect pitch.&quot;  Pitch recognition is very similar<br/>to color recognition, and a &quot;C&quot; that is a little higher or lower than<br/>the C of 12-ET does not sound out of tune in an alternate tuning that<br/>represents consonant intervals more accurately than does 12-ET;<br/>indeed, it sounds better in tune.  If we consider the pitch &quot;C&quot; to<br/>correspond to green color (which it actually does, if you raise the<br/>frequency of the pitch by 40-some octaves to correspond to a<br/>frequency of light), then a slightly higher C is going to sound like<br/>a hue that is slightly more bluish (or less yellowish), but it would<br/>still be interpreted as a &quot;C&quot; (or within the color-class &quot;green&quot;).<br/>So for me, memorizing pitches in an alternative tuning is very much<br/>like memorizing hues of color in a much finer palette than what 12-ET<br/>offers.</p><p>There are certain problems, such as sharps differing in pitch from<br/>flats by varying amounts and even opposing direction, between<br/>different tunings.  Since I used a multiplicity of tonal systems<br/>early on, rather than committing myself to one particular tuning, I<br/>have never worked at developing my pitch acuity since my childhood.</p><p>&gt; My pitch is in the<br/>&gt; grayzone between relative and perfect. I can&apos;t usually hear a pitch<br/>and immediately<br/>&gt; tell you what it is, but in harmonic context, I have<br/>uncanny &quot;intuition&quot; as to what the<br/>&gt; key might be. I also have the &quot;phantom pitch&quot; phenomenon where you<br/>try to guess<br/>&gt; what a pitch might be, can&apos;t do it, but then walk over to a piano<br/>to find out and in the<br/>&gt; split second before your finger touches a key you are<br/>mysteriously &apos;guided&apos; to select<br/>&gt; the correct pitch. I can sometimes hear a pitch coming from the<br/>piano before I play it,<br/>&gt; even if it&apos;s been hours since I last touched an instrument. -Justin</p><p>It sounds as if you&apos;re experiencing some bits and pieces of tonal<br/>memory and might be able to develop it if you made the effort.  One<br/>hint: from experience I have found that it is much easier through<br/>repeated hearings to &quot;etch&quot; the memory of the pitches of a short<br/>musical passage into my mind than it is to try to memorize single<br/>(isolated) tones.  This is analogous to learning to pronounce vowel<br/>sounds of a foreign language by hearing them in words rather than in<br/>isolation.</p><p>Some years ago (in the late 1970s) I received an advertisement<br/>through the mail by someone conducting &quot;perfect pitch&quot; seminars, in<br/>which he claimed that he could teach others how to acquire tonal<br/>memory.

I suspect that<br/>&gt; this uses the same part of the brain that is involved with the<br/>&gt; ability to learn foreign languages with a proper accent.</p><p>From what I know from neurolinguistics, this is probably correct (and flies in the face<br/>of the Chomskyan theories of pre-wired language and processing)-- tone<br/>recognition, like language, is entirely learned (and not innate) through a combination<br/>of social contextualization, imitation and other generalized learning. No one would<br/>say that culture is innate, and yet a 5 year old child masters his/her cultural norms<br/>often better than his/her linguistic norms...certainly (usually) better than his/her<br/>musical norms. -Justin</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2003 2:51:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Some years ago (in the late 1970s) I received an advertisement<br/>&gt;&gt; through the mail by someone conducting &quot;perfect pitch&quot; seminars,</p><p>Probably David L.

Using the harpsichord timbre, I<br/>&gt; set the pitch down 1/2 step and found, much to my surprise, that I<br/>&gt; had no trouble at all playing a couple of fairly difficult (but<br/>&gt; familiar) pieces of music if I had the printed page in front of me.<br/>&gt; Trying to play from memory was a little more difficult, but I found<br/>&gt; that my mind was able to interpret the pitches as being (to use an<br/>&gt; astronomer&apos;s term for observing far-off objects as they were in the<br/>&gt; distant past) red-shifted in frequency so I could think of a lowered<br/>&gt; C, for example, as a flat C rather than a C-flat (or B).  (Also<br/>&gt; relevant to this is my observation below about pitch perception<br/>&gt; tolerance.)</p><p>George, thanks for a wonderful description of a great experiment!</p><p>&gt; I developed the ability (which I prefer to call &quot;tonal memory&quot;) as a<br/>&gt; 6-year-old accordion student.  I observed that I was able to remember<br/>&gt; the pitch &quot;A&quot; before even knowing what its name was.  Thinking that<br/>&gt; it might be useful, I then proceeded to memorize the pitches of all<br/>&gt; the white keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I remember one day my father picked up the instrument and was trying<br/>&gt; to pick out a melody on it.  At one point he failed to locate the<br/>&gt; desired note, so I pointed out the key he was looking for.  When he<br/>&gt; asked how I knew that was the correct one, I explained that I had<br/>&gt; memorized what they all sounded like, and he promptly had me turn my<br/>&gt; back to him to demonstrate that I could easily identify one after<br/>&gt; another.  When he played a black key, however, I drew a blank and<br/>&gt; could only say that it must be a black key, because I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; identify it.</p><p>this is amazingly similar to a story i can tell,<br/>regarding the day i discovered that my brother has<br/>absolute pitch.

One<br/>&gt; hint: from experience I have found that it is much easier through<br/>&gt; repeated hearings to &quot;etch&quot; the memory of the pitches of a short<br/>&gt; musical passage into my mind than it is to try to memorize single<br/>&gt; (isolated) tones.
