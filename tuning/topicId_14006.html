Report of (Asian Traditional Perfrorming<br/>&gt; Arts 1978) Heibonsha ltd Publishers, Tokyo, 1980<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Many thanks for the information and references. For my part, I intend<br/>&gt; to track down some of the instruments we&apos;ve mentioned (there must be a<br/>&gt; Mongolian community somewhere in London UK) because they seem to be<br/>&gt; tried and tested as to their timbral blend with each other, hence<br/>&gt; their incorporation into Mongolian chamber/orchestral ensembles. Some<br/>&gt; of these blends fit into my idea of &apos;new&apos; orchestral sounds in terms<br/>&gt; of making new instruments. I love the rough &apos;folky&apos; edge to the music,<br/>&gt; as well as the capacity for extreme tenderness. Phase 2 would involve<br/>&gt; incorporating voices and then coercing choristers into learning new<br/>&gt; intervals.</p><p>Another recommendation for everyone - Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma&apos;s<br/>&quot;Sampradaya&quot;. This features father and son on santoor (hammered<br/>dulcimer) with tabla and tanpura. It is on the Real World record label<br/>(licensed to Virgin) 1999. The beauty of the santoor is that no matter<br/>how hard it &apos;rocks&apos; the music is always tranquil.
