After a<br/>while, I got used to both, and then hearing 12-tET music really<br/>bothered me. It&apos;s remarkable how pliable to conditioning our ears are,<br/>and must be experienced to be believed.</p><p>Boy. I&apos;m really with you 100% on this... Also, I&apos;ve had many a night<br/>where I&apos;ve been feverishly working away on parts and gotten my ear and<br/>brain firmly around a particular thicket, only to have my ear (and<br/>brain) wake up in the morning and it&apos;s no longer there - I can&apos;t &quot;hear<br/>it.&quot; But it&apos;s always the same; after about an hour of fiddling around<br/>with it my ears right back on it, and usually it&apos;s there to stay after<br/>that.</p><p>&gt;You&apos;ll find that this augmented second is one of the most important<br/>melodic intervals in Eastern European and much Middle Eastern music --<br/>try Klezmer for a start.</p><p>I&apos;ve used a variety of 7 note scales in 13e to exploit the 3/13<br/>augmented second scale step (even a double augmented 4/13):</p><p>3 1 2 1 2 2 2<br/>3 1 3 1 2 1 2<br/>2 1 4 1 2 1 2</p><p>I really find these scales to be *extremely* beautiful, and to impart<br/>a real melancholy ache, or longing, through what is often said to be a<br/>nearly &quot;unusable&quot; EDO; 13e (I also find that they often have a sound<br/>very akin to the Eastern European scales of which Paul is broadly<br/>referring to as well).</p><p>Dan</p></div>
