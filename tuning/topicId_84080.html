So you<br/>have pure tones consisting of 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800<br/>Hz. The difference tone is 100 Hz. So you would then hear 100, 200,<br/>300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 Hz. This still does nothing to<br/>explain why you hear those eight sinusoids as combining to make one<br/>note of a certain complex timbre... If it really had to do entirely<br/>with difference tones, why wouldn&apos;t we still hear those notes as being<br/>8 separate sinusoids?</p><p>The short answer is that something else is happening as well. There is<br/>a mechanism in your brain grouping frequencies in harmonic or<br/>near-harmonic series together. We all know the usual explanation is<br/>that you hear a &quot;virtual pitch&quot; which corresponds to the brain&apos;s best<br/>estimate of the GCD of all these frequencies, but that might be a bit<br/>misleading. The important thing occurring here is that a<br/>psychoacoustic &quot;perspective shift&quot; is taking place; you go from<br/>hearing separate frequencies to a combination of them all with a<br/>certain timbre. This can happen even if the fundamental is absent, or<br/>if the harmonics don&apos;t line up perfectly with a harmonic series.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Fri, Jul 17, 2009 at 10:35 AM, Aaron Krister<br/>Johnson&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Intersting question, Kraig.

The older idea that we can only obtain the harmonic series via boundary conditions (such as the length of a string or pipe) is also a psychological boundary. The GCD applies also between boundary conditions themselves and when none exist at all. For eg, to the A440 note given in my example, add another frequency E660Hz with the same harmonics. The ratio is 3/2 and the GCD is A220Hz which will be the freq of the new wave.

So far I&apos;ve been a very bad student and feel like I understand about 2% of what I&apos;m supposed to. However, I&apos;ve managed to get my act together enough to do a crude experiment. Using a basic sine wave generator (oscil opcode) and GEN10 sub-routine, I first listened to an A440Hz fundamental. Next I gave the first 19 harmonics equal amplitude (at 1) but cut out 1,2,4,8,and 16 harmonics (i.e. = 0). It looks like this in the .sco file:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; f1 0 65536 10 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where the nth harmonic is the nth row after the 10. As I always suspected from studying waves, the note was still heard as an A440Hz the only difference being in the timbre (which admittedly sounded awful, but that&apos;s beside the point at this stage). I don&apos;t know how to do it yet, but I&apos;m sure that if we tweeked each harmonic according to Erlich/Carl&apos; s entropy model so that each was slightly out-of-tune, then the result would be pretty much the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IOW, what this proves is that frequency = GCD = tonality. And mathematically speaking this applies to all waves without exception. ALL that is required is that two waves exist at the same place and time for this to apply, regardless as to how those waves were generated. That is, independently of &apos;boundary condition&apos;. Yet if we do a Google search on &apos;GCD&apos;, &apos;Euclidean Algorithm&apos; etc, NOT A SINGLE MENTION is made of Pythagoras or musical harmony. If we look at a textbook on differential equations, he might get a tiny mention in the back pages under the title &apos;boundary conditions&apos;, this despite the fact that the entire book is unwittingly speaking of wave motion. It is as if the whole world has forgotten that Euclid lived centuries after Pythagoras, that the discovery b/w string lengths and frequency in whole numbers combined the hitherto separate worlds of &apos;pure&apos; maths, geometry and music, that the proportionality b/w string length and period allowed time<br/>&gt;  to be represented by geometrical lengths in space i.e. the so-called &apos;fourth dimension&apos;. In short, I would say that the very raison d&apos;etre of the Euclidean Algorithm is that it is a model of musical harmony. It&apos;s divorce from music into &apos;pure&apos; maths was likely the mistake of a group celibate monks during the dark ages. Judging from the standard educational curriculum, it is little wonder that we musicians are not getting paid and left to squabble over the remains! So I suggest that instead of wasting our time fighting over $200, we wage an internet war on all fronts.

If it really had to do entirely<br/>&gt; with difference tones, why wouldn&apos;t we still hear those notes as being<br/>&gt; 8 separate sinusoids?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The short answer is that something else is happening as well. There is<br/>&gt; a mechanism in your brain grouping frequencies in harmonic or<br/>&gt; near-harmonic series together. We all know the usual explanation is<br/>&gt; that you hear a &quot;virtual pitch&quot; which corresponds to the brain&apos;s best<br/>&gt; estimate of the GCD of all these frequencies, but that might be a bit<br/>&gt; misleading. The important thing occurring here is that a<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic &quot;perspective shift&quot; is taking place; you go from<br/>&gt; hearing separate frequencies to a combination of them all with a<br/>&gt; certain timbre. This can happen even if the fundamental is absent, or<br/>&gt; if the harmonics don&apos;t line up perfectly with a harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hi Mike,</p><p>Nicely said. Just to add to your point, I have a tendency to think of it more as an objective reality since the wave composite is what&apos;s &apos;out there&apos; if you know what I mean. The number of cps hitting the ear drum per second will be the GCD. But its interesting how our brain can still &apos;tune&apos; these detuned harmonics (I call it the Mick Jagger syndrome). We can even see this if we change one wave slightly (There&apos;s a sine wave applet on Google). If we draw 60 and 90 say to get a wave of 30 and change the 90 to 91, 92, etc...we see that it takes a while for the wave to change its shape.</p><p>Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, Jul 17, 2009 at 10:35 AM, Aaron Krister<br/>&gt; Johnson&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Intersting question, Kraig.

A possibility for a minor key might be something like 32:38:48:57 which still has two perfect fifths as the surrounding interval for both maj and min triads and is therefore &apos;simple&apos; enough for the ear to recognise. Here the maj 3 48/38 = 24/19 is sharp, but it might sound good in the minor key (eg Ebmaj in key of C min, relative major)??</p><p>While I&apos;m aware of the tests done on entropy etc, I still suspect that our instinctive avoidance of higher harmonics comes from the fact that if we concentrate on individual instruments then (as you know) the amplitude of upper partials decrease the higher you go. This gives the impression that the upper partials have less strength than the lower and therefore less meaning. But the gcd of course lifts this unrealistic restriction. Besides, if the brain seems to reduce them to simple whole numbers anyway, then what&apos;s the problem?</p><p>At any rate, I simply don&apos;t think difference tones have the correct properties to model music (IMO a useful model should try to uncover simple general principles, not bog us down with every conceivable detail which can only be attended to in writing music anyway. Why spend our time writing an algorithm for &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; when we can write the actual music?). Sure, difference tones might play a part, but only a mitigating one. At the end of the day what we are really looking for in diff tones is what ratios they form with the tonic. And this is modelled by the fact that if &apos;freq = gcd&apos; then we are really looking for diff&apos;s b/w two gcd&apos;s to see what ratio it forms with a third.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2009 8:46:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;ve said it before but strictly speaking 10:12:15 is the second relative<br/>&gt; minor in a major key i.e. Emin triad in key of Cmaj. A possibility for a<br/>&gt; minor key might be something like 32:38:48:57 which still has two perfect<br/>&gt; fifths as the surrounding interval for both maj and min triads and is<br/>&gt; therefore &apos;simple&apos; enough for the ear to recognise. Here the maj 3 48/38 =<br/>&gt; 24/19 is sharp, but it might sound good in the minor key (eg Ebmaj in key of<br/>&gt; C min, relative major)??</p><p>I think there are times in which a minor triad is going to be heard as<br/>an upper extension of an overall major tonic, which might indicate<br/>that it&apos;s being perceived as 16:19:24. I&apos;ve often wondered if the<br/>equal tempered m3, when played over a Mixolydian modality, is somehow<br/>processed as being 16:19. It certainly does have a completely<br/>different sound in that context than the usual &quot;minor&quot; sonority that<br/>we&apos;re used to. I&apos;ve also heard that &quot;the blues b3&quot; interval is 7:6,<br/>but given that there are a thousand different b3&apos;s used in different<br/>contexts in the blues (including 11:9), I can&apos;t see why 16:19 wouldn&apos;t<br/>be in there as well.</p><p>But even with stuff like that though, it&apos;s hard to tell if the<br/>different chord quality percept really does have to do with the<br/>perceptual quality of experiencing an interval as being 16:19 vs 5:6<br/>or anything like that.</p><p>&gt; While I&apos;m aware of the tests done on entropy etc, I still suspect that our<br/>&gt; instinctive avoidance of higher harmonics comes from the fact that if we<br/>&gt; concentrate on individual instruments then (as you know) the amplitude of<br/>&gt; upper partials decrease the higher you go. This gives the impression that<br/>&gt; the upper partials have less strength than the lower and therefore less<br/>&gt; meaning. But the gcd of course lifts this unrealistic restriction. Besides,<br/>&gt; if the brain seems to reduce them to simple whole numbers anyway, then<br/>&gt; what&apos;s the problem?</p><p>Because sometimes the gcd of an individual dyad in the chord or an<br/>upper structure triad in the chord is so strong that it tends to be<br/>heard as the &quot;root&quot; of the chord itself. Take a major 6 chord. C E G<br/>A. Technically, the GCD of that is going to be an F a few octaves<br/>down, but I&apos;ll be extremely surprised if you hear the root of that<br/>chord as being anything besides a C. When I hear a chord like that (or<br/>10:12:15, for that matter), I do hear another faint note &quot;A&quot; at the<br/>bottom, perhaps from the E-A dyad, which doesn&apos;t quite mix with the<br/>4:5:6 so evenly. But it&apos;s a real stretch for me to then go all the way<br/>down and place that A and the C from the C-E-G and hear the F at the<br/>bottom.</p><p>If you play the notes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, you might hear that as the upper<br/>partials of an F major triad for sure. If you play the note &quot;A&quot; an<br/>octave below the &quot;C&quot;, it might a bit more difficult to hear it that<br/>way. If you play the note &quot;A&quot; an octave below the &quot;C&quot; and play the<br/>note &quot;A&quot; at 1/4 the volume of the &quot;C&quot;, it&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;re going<br/>to hear it that way at all. That&apos;s why the simple straightforward GCD<br/>approach might not work in all cases.</p><p>Further complicating things is that the notes you imagine in your head<br/>are going to change the way you hear the chord as well. I did an<br/>experiment once where I played &quot;happy birthday&quot; on my keyboard on a<br/>timbre with just harmonics 1 and 3 in. I slowly lowered the level of<br/>the first harmonic until only 3 was left. While playing like that, I<br/>could still hear the VF corresponding to what the note was before the<br/>1 dropped out, if I concentrated on what the note was &quot;supposed&quot; to be<br/>and followed myself mentally like that. The perception was fragile,<br/>and often I&apos;d revert to hearing that isolated 3 as its own 1, but I<br/>got better at it with practice. Without the 1 even being there, I got<br/>it to sound like a 1:3 timbre just being run through an extreme high<br/>pass filter.</p><p>So the individual&apos;s own mental energy can, to a certain extent, push<br/>the perception of an interval into a certain direction. This is pretty<br/>easy to test yourself just by listening to a 350-cent third and trying<br/>to hear it as a minor third, and then as a major third, and keep<br/>flipping your perception of it like that. Not that this invalidates<br/>any theory you&apos;d make, but it is a point worth noting. It is, of<br/>course, much more difficult to hear a major third as a fourth or<br/>anything like that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2009 9:00:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Because sometimes the gcd of an individual dyad in the chord or an<br/>&gt; upper structure triad in the chord is so strong that it tends to be<br/>&gt; heard as the &quot;root&quot; of the chord itself.

First, the strength of the major triad clearly outweighs the presence of the maj 6 (which is generally regarded as one of the neutral &apos;colour&apos; notes). Secondly, A can belong to the HS of C tonic without F. For eg, the open Pyth 27/16 is a distinct possibility, nice odd number over an 8ve. While thirdly, it is also possible that the gcd is an A since C6 = Am is just another inversion of Am i.e. relative major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you play the notes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, you might hear that as the upper<br/>&gt; partials of an F major triad for sure.

If you play A and C without anything else, I bet that most people like myself would immediately hear it as A minor every time. This is because thirds from the tonic give a much stronger tonality than thirds from the third to the fifth. If I was asked to write a basic tune for two horns alone, I would always choose standard 3rds, 10ths and 6ths. If asked to write two horns with accompaniment, I&apos;d usually choose the guide tones b/w 3rds and 7ths. And remember that I&apos;m talking about rules of harmony here, an idealistic set of useful guidelines independent of volume and timbre, not musical composition where all factors are taken into account (the periodicity of a wave is independent of amplitude and has many choice of harmonics). I&apos;m not for instance disagreeing with what you tell me about psychoacoustics which are very interesting but just categorising them under &apos;composition&apos;.</p><p>Much of the difficulty with simple first principles is that they appear obvious and therefore trivial. In fact they usually represent the solution to a much bigger problem and it is only when we put them back into action in more complex examples that their breadth once again becomes apparent. For eg, I said that 10:12:15 is an Em in the key of C maj, as opposed to an Em 16:19:24 in its own key. Or the Pyth minor 27:32 could be seen as an A min in the key of C maj. 54:64:81 for the A min triad now has the Pyth maj 3rd as well as the latter interval. Now here we find our two basic minor chord substitutions for a C major. By extending these three we obtain all possibilities. If we chuck an F in the mix to obtain D min (and strictly speaking a new A min), then this is basically a change of key (placing the C in the role of 5th). What other model has the ability to distinguish between root note and tonic? But besides this, the gcd is what happens when we add waves. It is a universal principle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further complicating things is that the notes you imagine in your head<br/>&gt; are going to change the way you hear the chord as well.

I remember Leonard Bernstein pointing out that the &quot;ner ner na ner ner song&quot; (5th, maj 3rd and maj 6th) is teasing because we always expect to hear the tonic but never do. A smart arse friend said that we could hear the A min, but I said it was likely a passing note. In any case, I know exactly what you mean.

It is here in teaching or forming rules of harmony that the gcd might come into its own. It behaves like music.</p><p>Rick</p><p>&gt; &gt; Hi Mike. In fact 16:19 is closer to the tempered m3 than 5:6. On this point<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve always argued the possibility that the ET minor has created a new<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;phenomenon&quot; which has a logic outside historical JI i.e. it evolved as a<br/>&gt; &gt; new consequence of 12 tet not JI but could be approx rational numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And 19:24 is closer to the equal tempered major 3 than 5:4, but I<br/>&gt; doubt you&apos;re going to hear it that way most times.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But actually Mike I play 6 chords all the time and there is no ambiguity.<br/>&gt; &gt; First, the strength of the major triad clearly outweighs the presence of the<br/>&gt; &gt; maj 6 (which is generally regarded as one of the neutral &apos;colour&apos; notes).<br/>&gt; &gt; Secondly, A can belong to the HS of C tonic without F. For eg, the open Pyth<br/>&gt; &gt; 27/16 is a distinct possibility, nice odd number over an 8ve. While thirdly,<br/>&gt; &gt; it is also possible that the gcd is an A since C6 = Am is just another<br/>&gt; &gt; inversion of Am i.e. relative major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Putting 27/16 would work in theory, but putting 5/3 in sounds much<br/>&gt; less dissonant and resonates much more. And I&apos;m specifically talking<br/>&gt; about the 5/3 version of that chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And as you said yourself, if the major 6 chord can be heard equally as<br/>&gt; being a maj6 chord and an m7 chord in inversion... That&apos;s the<br/>&gt; ambiguity I&apos;m talking about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry Mike, have to disagree with you there. If you play A and C without<br/>&gt; &gt; anything else, I bet that most people like myself would immediately hear it<br/>&gt; &gt; as A minor every time. This is because thirds from the tonic give a much<br/>&gt; &gt; stronger tonality than thirds from the third to the fifth. If I was asked to<br/>&gt; &gt; write a basic tune for two horns alone, I would always choose standard 3rds,<br/>&gt; &gt; 10ths and 6ths. If asked to write two horns with accompaniment, I&apos;d usually<br/>&gt; &gt; choose the guide tones b/w 3rds and 7ths. And remember that I&apos;m talking<br/>&gt; &gt; about rules of harmony here, an idealistic set of useful guidelines<br/>&gt; &gt; independent of volume and timbre, not musical composition where all factors<br/>&gt; &gt; are taken into account (the periodicity of a wave is independent of<br/>&gt; &gt; amplitude and has many choice of harmonics). I&apos;m not for instance<br/>&gt; &gt; disagreeing with what you tell me about psychoacoustics which are very<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting but just categorising them under &apos;composition&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might be right there. I guess my example went a bit too far. But<br/>&gt; it does still seem to apply to difference tones, or possible choices<br/>&gt; of GCD&apos;s, generated when you play a minor chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Much of the difficulty with simple first principles is that they appear<br/>&gt; &gt; obvious and therefore trivial. In fact they usually represent the solution<br/>&gt; &gt; to a much bigger problem and it is only when we put them back into action in<br/>&gt; &gt; more complex examples that their breadth once again becomes apparent. For<br/>&gt; &gt; eg, I said that 10:12:15 is an Em in the key of C maj, as opposed to an Em<br/>&gt; &gt; 16:19:24 in its own key. Or the Pyth minor 27:32 could be seen as an A min<br/>&gt; &gt; in the key of C maj. 54:64:81 for the A min triad now has the Pyth maj 3rd<br/>&gt; &gt; as well as the latter interval. Now here we find our two basic minor chord<br/>&gt; &gt; substitutions for a C major. By extending these three we obtain all<br/>&gt; &gt; possibilities.

(This is why I had trouble distinguishing frequencies from intervals if you remember). And theoretically speaking, the gcd gives &apos;one note at a time&apos;: if we play &apos;two notes&apos; simultaneously which form a ratio, then a third (single) note is produced which is the gcd. I&apos;m guessing that if we made new tests with for example the note f1 0 65536 10 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1, that is with the fundamental and its 8ve&apos;s missing, the results would be the same.</p><p>But what if we applied HE to the harmonics themselves since these too are intervals?

If you tak&eacute; two periods of 201Hz and 301Hz whose overtones are loud enough, then the 2nd harmonic of the higher tone is 602Hz and the 3rd harmonic of the lower tone is 603Hz, which means that this is the lowest &quot;band&quot; where you get beating.

This leads me to the &quot;merely speculative&quot; idea for finding the approximate fundamental frequency this way because if you divide 301 by 3 or 201 by 2, you get ~100.33333 and 100.5 and the arithmetic mean of these is also ~100.41667, similarly as 602.5 was the arithmetic mean of 602 and 603.

And I was just trying to find out what had lead him to this conclusion because if you use one particular set of fifths and thirds, there&apos;s no obvious reason for that.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2009 7:08:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I fully agree that context, conditioning and imagination, loudness and emphasis<br/>&gt; &gt; will all not only play a vital role but will override the gcd everytime.

If a chess player sees a proper game for a split second they can place all the pieces, but can&apos;t do it for random placement. Similarly, if a muso is playing in a certain key, he/she is not even aware of the &apos;wrong&apos; notes as a possibility. It is as if they are playing a completely different keyboard for different things.

If you used, for example, a C of 256Hz (which is much lower than a real C but it&apos;s just easier to count), then the E is 320Hz, G is 384Hz, and B is 480Hz. And whether you only play C-E-G or you play E-G-B or you play all four tones, it&apos;s up to you. Note that this chord doesn&apos;t contain any seconds so there&apos;s no problem with commas unless you extend the chain of thirds beyond 2 octaves -- bear in mind that a minor+major+minor+major+minor+major+minor third makes 2 octaves plus a syntonic comma.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2009 8:47:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You pointed out that 101, 202, and 301?

I still have to play around with it many times to see whether I can eventually reach a meaningful conclusion. I think the explanation of approximate GCDs here is actually much much more difficult than approximate LCMs. Now let&apos;s stop thinking about how humans hear sounds for a while and just &quot;observe&quot; the behavior (or the actual properties) of the sounds themselves. If you tak&eacute; two periods of 201Hz and 301Hz whose overtones are loud enough, then the 2nd harmonic of the higher tone is 602Hz and the 3rd harmonic of the lower tone is 603Hz, which means that this is the lowest &quot;band&quot; where you get beating. But recall the trigonometric identity which tells you that &quot;sin(a+b( + sin(a-b) = sin(a( * cos(b) * 2&quot;. This means that the 602Hz and 603Hz beats can also be understood as a 602.5Hz signal which is &quot;amplitude-modulated&quot; by another signal whose actual frequency is 0.5Hz and whose &quot;half-wave&quot; frequency is 1Hz (I know this term is nonsense, I just meant something like &quot;when I don&apos;t care about plus or minus&quot;). Dividing 602.5 by 2 and 3 makes 301.25 and ~200.83333, whose GCD is ~100.41667. This leads me to the &quot;merely speculative&quot; idea for finding the approximate fundamental frequency this way because if you divide 301 by 3 or 201 by 2, you get ~100.33333 and 100.5 and the arithmetic mean of these is also ~100.41667, similarly as 602.5 was the arithmetic mean of 602 and 603. But I&apos;m not sure how well that could work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Petr,</p><p>I had more of a simple-minded approach in mind where we use approximation signs ~ instead of equals = to get the approx gcd, 301/201 ~ 3/2, 301/3 ~ 100, that type of thing. Then I&apos;ve been trying to think of a more rigorous approach based on the HE model. But I think your approach of beats and averages is a very interesting possibility.

One is to find the approximate guide tone and the other is to find the approximate fundamental. In the first case, the 2nd harmonic of 301 is 602 and the 3rd harmonic of 201 is 603, which means there will be 1 beat per second in the 602-603Hz range. At the same time, if you multiply a steady sine wave of 602.5Hz with a cosine wave of 0.5Hz, you get exactly the same as if you mixed two sine waves of 602Hz and 603Hz. So we could possibly say that the frequency of the &quot;approximate guide tone&quot; is 602.5Hz, which is the arithmetic mean of 603 and 602. If I want to find the approximate fundamental frequency from this, I can divide this by 6 (i.e. the LCM of 2 and 3), which gives me ~100.41667Hz. For the other approach, if you divide 201 by 2 and 301 by 3, you get 100.5 and ~100.33333, whose arithmetic mean is also ~100.41667 (i.e. the same approximate fundamental frequency). If you wanted, for whatever reason, to find the approximate guide tone frequency from that, you could multiply this by 6 (supposing you&apos;re examining the 2nd and 3rd harmonic) and you get 602.5.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2009 10:41:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; HE minima are not Gaussians on the HE curve, but OK, for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any low-HE interval, I can find another low-HE interval for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you nearby.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh, I thought you said they were Gaussians.

Since we can sometimes hear them for tempered intervals you jump to the conclusion that the definition must be a more &quot;limited&quot; version of a more &quot;general&quot; theory of &quot;virtual fundamentals&quot;, that it is the difference tone after all, for example. But this is true only when the difference happens to equal or approximate the gcd. I say it over and over again that the &quot;frequency&quot; of a wave IS its gcd, irrespective of whether it is subsonic or not, or whatever loose and unexamined terms scientists have applied in the past. There is nothing &quot;virtual&quot; about them; whenever two or more waves occupy the same place at the same time, regardless of how they are generated, if their freq&apos;s are relatively prime then a third single wave will be produced with a freq corresponding to the gcd. And since this is the more general term for &quot;frequency&quot;, then nothing stops us from saying that each of the original two or more &quot;frequencies&quot; were themselves gcd&apos;s. Or to say it the other way, we can take this &quot;third&quot; gcd wave, add it to another gcd, and if these are relatively prime then this will create a new wave with that new gcd. And this proof can be repeated ad infinitum. Therefore, there is nothing &quot;limited&quot; about them either. When you say below &quot;how can...the GCD tell us the perceived fundamental?&quot;, the sentence reads &quot;how can the fundamental tell us about the perceived fundamental?&quot;. And since the difference tone is the difference between two frequencies, then it is the difference between two gcd&apos;s. The case of simple sine waves or harmonic spectra starting from 1 is but a small limited case e.g. series 1: 9Hz, 18Hz, 27...series 2: 12Hz, 24, 36...gcd between respective harmonics: 3Hz, 6, 9...(observe that the gcd of harmonics = harmonics of the gcd. Much easier than the Euclidean algorithm once we know the first). Difference tones: 3, 6, 9...However, new series 2: 15Hz, 30, 45...gcd series: 3Hz, 6Hz, 9Hz...differences: 6Hz,12,18...which we see is not necessarily the same.</p><p>So now you see the importance of trying to find how HE might apply to get approximate gcd&apos;s?

Are these two approaches equivalent or will they give different results? etc...This would be a far more realistic model for explaining tempered &quot;virtual&quot; fundamentals than applying the wrong theory of difference tones and then compounding the uncertainty by applying HE to them.</p><p>Sorry for lecturing Carl but I think this is important.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; HE as it&apos;s currently formulated can only be applied to pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at a time.

I<br/>&gt; can&rsquo;t -- I mean, I really can&rsquo;t hear any 1Hz periodicity in such a sound<br/>&gt; even though it IS there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr</p><p>Nor is it anything that you can predict with 100% accuracy, as per the<br/>example I posted above where I dropped out all the harmonics except 3<br/>from a certain timbre and I could still, for a short amount of time,<br/>hear it as a 1:3 timbre.</p><p>So when I play a &quot;C&quot;, you can imagine that it&apos;s the fifth of an F<br/>major chord, or the third of A minor, or anything like that. In fact,<br/>you can imagine that it&apos;s the #4 from a Gb lydian scale, or really<br/>imagine in your head anything you want and have this note fit into it<br/>however you&apos;d like.</p><p>And likewise, if I play a sine wave in an upper register, you can<br/>imagine that it&apos;s an upper partial of a lower tone, and the actual<br/>perceived -timbre- will change. I wonder if the relationship really is<br/>that direct, though...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2009 1:57:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, that&apos;s a pretty limited theory of virtual fundamentals<br/>&gt; &gt; wouldn&apos;t you say, since we still hear them when chords are<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But that&apos;s exactly my point.

As you say yourself, why we<br/>&gt; &gt; hear &apos;different&apos; waves might come down to psychoacoustic properties.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a slightly different take on the superposition principle than<br/>&gt; what I know. And the reason we hear &apos;different&apos; waves is that the<br/>&gt; inner ear basically consists of a bunch of hair cells that only<br/>&gt; resonate at certain frequencies, and this splits the combined wave<br/>&gt; form out into a bunch of different waves, producing a bunch of<br/>&gt; different signals.</p><p>Well that&apos;s interesting Mike. I know little or nothing about this end of things. And since my mind tells me that the &apos;real&apos; wave out there is a single entity but my ears tell me quite another, then I knew there had to be more to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mike, you know very well by our recent personal correspondence that there is<br/>&gt; &gt; much more to it than that, that my &quot;crude assumption&quot; is actually an<br/>&gt; &gt; elementary first principle, which among other things reminds us that the<br/>&gt; &gt; Fourier series and all of its variants are subject to the principle of<br/>&gt; &gt; superposition, not the other way around. Remember that Fourier&apos;s first paper<br/>&gt; &gt; just asked the question; lets assume that any arbitrary periodic function<br/>&gt; &gt; f(t) is equal to an infinite trigonometric series (i.e. superposition of<br/>&gt; &gt; whole-numbered sine waves, otherwise known as the harmonic series). Then<br/>&gt; &gt; what are its coefficients? Therefore superposition was assumed to begin with<br/>&gt; &gt; and the rest followed from this one basic insight. The fact that the<br/>&gt; &gt; transform deals with non-periodic functions doesn&apos;t change the fact that we<br/>&gt; &gt; are still dealing with superimposed sine waves one iota. (And as I&apos;ve shown<br/>&gt; &gt; you, the &apos;time&apos; domain in the STFT can always and in principle be written as<br/>&gt; &gt; a function of the cycles and period of the waves themselves according to t =<br/>&gt; &gt; nT, so that signal processing models are designed on this logic, but that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; getting too complicated for the moment).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think you&apos;re ever going to hear me say that Fourier analysis<br/>&gt; has nothing to do with superimposing sinusoids on top of each other to<br/>&gt; recreate the original signal. But if you&apos;re not dealing with a<br/>&gt; periodic signal, then there IS no GCD. And most real world signals, as<br/>&gt; you will see, are usually aperiodic. And when the signal IS periodic,<br/>&gt; if you claim that you hear the perceived fundamental of every possible<br/>&gt; chord as being the GCD, then that claim simply isn&apos;t true.</p><p>I was simply pointing out that Fourier analysis, both historically and logically, came from the principle of superposition rather than vice-versa, not saying that you disagreed but counting on the fact that you did agree. And it would be absurd if you truly believed I didn&apos;t know that waves must be periodic for the GCD to exist, since I&apos;ve been saying that they are one and the same thing all along. For example, given any periodic f(t) = f(t + T), if we set this equal to an infinite trig series, then we are ALREADY assuming that some GCD wave exists which will approximate the original f(t) with the same period T. IOW it is quite possible for the resultant summation wave to be periodic while missing its 1st harmonic (I said coefficient before). So I&apos;m not talking about &apos;real world&apos; signals such as hand claps and firecrackers which require a Fourier Transform with an infinite number of frequencies in a finite range (the discreet FT being for digitalisation I believe?). Rather I&apos;m talking about periodic waves and there association to tradition musical harmony, and mathematically about all periodic Fourier Series in general. Nothing here contradicts FA in any way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand this. The first coefficient of a Fourier Series is going to be the DC term, the second is going to be the fundamental. If what you mean is the second coefficient, or the first harmonic, then that would indeed be the fundamental, even if it is zero, and its period length would equal the length of the window you use.</p><p>Yes I was getting confused by the fact that some texts start with the A(0) coefficient separately while others include it in A(N). I meant first harmonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And furthermore, your approach here has a fatal flaw, which is the<br/>&gt; same flaw I&apos;ve been talking about all along: the GCD of any Fourier<br/>&gt; Series is going to equal the frequency corresponding to the window<br/>&gt; size you use, by definition. So if you evaluate the Fourier Series of a periodic signal with a window size equalling exactly one period of the signal, everything will work out fine. Otherwise, you&apos;re going to have a few issues to deal with.</p><p>Yet I still don&apos;t see how we&apos;re in disagreement. By &apos;window&apos; do you mean something a &apos;window in time&apos; of period T? (It sounds more like a finite Transform rather than a series since the latter is theoretically infinite in time. Am I missing something here?). But if you are talking about choosing your window to equal T, then I can&apos;t see how you would do otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How are you going to figure out what one period of the signal is when you don&apos;t know the signal in question? What if the signal is aperiodic? What if the signal is periodic with a volume envelope? That will add its own frequencies into the signal.</p><p>Ah, but that&apos;s a completely different question. I think I see what&apos;s going on here. You&apos;re talking about practicalities of signal processing whereas I&apos;m making a more general point about periodic waves, for these ARE what are usually used in musical harmony. Signal processing is not the only area of physics in which Fourier Analysis applies and its &apos;rules&apos; are not always applicable across the board. FA is also used to figure out the shape of a plucked string or periodic air pressure in a pipe for example. But neither of these require a &apos;window&apos; to do that analysis. Now admittedly I don&apos;t know much about Signal processing and have much to learn there, but I suspect that it is only when we try to record or recreate analogue waves in a digital environment, or transmit and receive them as radio &apos;signals&apos; that we mightn&apos;t know what the period is and need to do a Fourier Transform to retrieve the information.</p><p>In any case, what I&apos;m talking about here is how superposition can be used to explain musical harmony between periodic waves. I&apos;m also making the point that this same rule will apply to any wave which is periodic, by definition. And finally, I&apos;ve been pointing out that, mathematically speaking at least, the variable t appearing on the left side of a Fourier equation can always be written as a function of the class of periods appearing on the right. This is because time &apos;behaves&apos; like a tempo, which has been (unconsciously?) encoded in its representation by numbers. Therefore, trying to find the &apos;optimum window&apos; in your example below is reflected in this fact; for Fourier series, it is easy since there&apos;s only one choice. For aperiodic Transforms it is much more difficult. There&apos;s more work to do in this, but it&apos;s there.</p><p>Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, as I&apos;ve said, you COULD perform some clever mathematical analysis<br/>&gt; on the signal to somehow figure out what the optimum window size is to<br/>&gt; use at any given moment, or even do something more complicated<br/>&gt; involving splitting the signal into different signals and use<br/>&gt; different window sizes for each, or you could go right to wavelets and<br/>&gt; get it over with.

You&apos;re getting too good at that&quot;? It was not the place of the king-to-be to appear like a mere tradesman, especially a musician which was seen as being little more than a prostitute. Aspects of this Ancient Greek prejudice that musikae is &quot;effeminate&quot; and geometria is &quot;manly&quot; is still with us today. Although Pythagoras unified the two and two centuries later Euclid worked out the inner logic of harmonia (his algorithm), we must also remember that both Plato and Aristotle, who didn&apos;t like this idea, came from the Athenian aristocracy and influenced the course of Western education for the next 1500 years. Most notable is Aristotle&apos;s &apos;criticism&apos; of Pythagoras&apos; claim that &quot;everything is ratio!&quot;, which he took in the geometria &apos;counting number&apos; sense and then &apos;proved&apos; that it couldn&apos;t possibly be true. But Plato and Aristotle were wrong! It HAS been discovered that elementary &apos;particles&apos; like electrons and photons are in fact waves and that the frequency-energy of these waves is quantised in whole-numbers. And an analysis of the equations reveals that, contrary to the interpretation that was originally given to them, the Euclidean algorithm still does actually hold. It has to and it does. The essential flaw of the original interpretation was that it used a space-time model that was designed for discreet particles, not waves.</p><p>Now, these waves are continuous. Look through any textbook and you&apos;ll see that they are described by complex Euler waves of the form<br/>e^i(wt - kx). They cannot be otherwise since they are based on  probabilities of localising the energy which must be continuous. Therefore, any conclusions we can draw from these equations must also be true, in and for itself. In contrast, the whole area of the discreet Fourier Transform and (as you&apos;ve recently taught me) wavelets are designed for MODELLING these continuous waves in a discontinuous digital environment. From what I can gather, the fact that wavelets use different sized &apos;windows&apos; for different parts of a wave has more to do with sampling rates, which in itself is a simulated form of frequency. At any rate, saying these waves are &apos;real&apos; should be taken in the sense that the dragons in Lord of the Rings look &apos;realistic&apos;. This is not to say that they are not valid - both science and art transform raw materials to suit human needs - only that they can no longer hold the moral high ground, especially if they then want to then claim that they are representing untarnished objective reality. If we listen to a fugue by J.S. Bach on the radio, the radio waves are no more or less valid than the recorded waves being transmitted. This is what I meant when I gave this post its original heading.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2009 8:13:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Ive been reading over Erlich&apos;s post on Harmonic Entropy from 97&apos; and here&apos;s what he says:<br/>&quot;There is a very strong propensity for the ear to try to fit what it hears into one or a small number of harmonic series, and the fundamentals of these series, even if not physically present, are either heard outright, or provide a more subtle sense of overall pitch known to musicians as the &quot;root&quot;. As a component of consonance, the ease with which the ear/brain system can resolve the fundamental is known as &quot;tonalness.&quot; I have proposed a concept called &quot;relative harmonic entropy&quot; to model this component of dissonance. The harmonic entropy is based on the concept that the critical band represents a certain degree of uncertainty in the perception of pitch, and for any &quot;true&quot; interval, the auditory system will perceive a range of intervals spanning a number of simple-integer ratios. Simple-integer ratios come into the picture because if the heard tones are to be understood as harmonic overtones of some missing fundamental or root, they must form a simple-integer ratio with one another. The range is a sort of probability distribution, and a certain amount of probability is associated with each of the simple-integer ratios.&quot;</p><p>Now many years ago when I was trying to explain musical tonality, (how do we hear a tonic when its not present?), I discovered independently that all waves have one basic characteristic property; one cycle always occurs for an amount of time equal to the inverse of the highest common factor between component sine waves, not on the fundamental. In other words, the concept of &apos;frequency&apos; is no longer confined to that of the first harmonic. I then saw that this gives a possible alternate explanation of HE which, on review, it does.</p><p>Earlier you said that &quot;We don&apos;t hear GCD&apos;s. We hear pitches&quot;. I too thought this until I did an experiment. I thought that they were sub-audible and that we somehow recognise when we hit one of its 8ve&apos;s in the audible range. However, my very first post on this strand proved the complete opposite! I first listened to an A440Hz sine wave. Next I added the first 19 harmonics all with equal amplitude and still heard A440Hz as expected. All that was different was the tone. Next I took out all harmonics except the relative primes. That is, all that remained was 3,5,7,11,13,17 and 19. And what note did I hear? An A440Hz. The only difference was in the tonal quality which sounded weak and trebly.Observe also that none of the difference tones equals the tonic.</p><p>So in answer to your statement, we do hear GCD&apos;s because they ARE pitches. If we take the set of all pitches in the audible range from 20Hz upward, then these can be sine waves, GCD&apos;s and everything in between. Our possibilities are greatly expanded, not limited, and we also arrive at an objective theory which possibly explains &quot;virtual fundamentals&quot; by showing that they are not that &quot;virtual&quot; at all but are the actual frequency of the incoming wave.</p><p>Looking over Erlich&apos;s work it is clear to me now that, since his experiments were done with pure sine waves, then HE must apply to the harmonic series itself. We could take approximate values for the relative primes 3,5,7,...above and we should still hear something closer to A440Hz. Or to use your previous example,although 201Hz, 301Hz, 401Hz will have a GCD of 1Hz, since 1 is small compared to the component frequencies, then by HE what we will actually hear is something closer to 100Hz. This explains why we can still hear the GCD in tempered systems. Besides, I&apos;ve said many times that the tempered intervals are not as irrational as previously thought for this would make them aperiodic to infinity. More realistically we are only able to tune to within a few decimal places. The flat-fifth or sqrt 2 is not 1.41421356...all the way to infinity but 1.414 which is a high rational number.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2009 10:27:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Earlier you said that &quot;We don&apos;t hear GCD&apos;s.

Obviously GCD&apos;s by definition can&apos;t apply to irrationals (Recall for eg Pythagoras&apos; proof that sqrt2 is not a rational number). Since many tempered systems are based on irrationals and yet are tonal, then we must conclude that the GCD is not sufficiently general. However, this is where HE steps in (as I said below about 301Hz/201Hz approx 3/2 so that approx GCD is 301/3 approx 201/2). Transitive law: applying HE to the harmonic intervals we are automatically applying it to the GCD. It was this that attracted me to HE in the first place and why I asked for your help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Looking over Erlich&apos;s work it is clear to me now that, since<br/>&gt; &gt; his experiments were done with pure sine waves,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They weren&apos;t.</p><p>Well that&apos;s much of a muchness now.

Since all options are excluded except the GCD then the result speaks for itself. I&apos;ve given the mathematical proof more than once; The time period required for a wave to pass through one cycle is equal to its inverse GCD. The number of cycles passed per second (Hertz) is equal to the GCD, both of which represent the very definition of frequency. The frequency only corresponds to the 1st harmonic when they happen to be equal.<br/>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The term &quot;virtual fundamental&quot; may be my own coinage, so pay it no<br/>&gt; heed.  &quot;Virtual pitch&quot; is an established term.  According to<br/>&gt; Wikipedia, it comes from Ernst Terhardt.  And, whaddayaknow, Terhardt<br/>&gt; has a web page explaining it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/virtualp.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/virtualp.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However much you play with the words, what you&apos;re talking about looks<br/>&gt; very much like virtual pitch.  It&apos;s been around for a long time and is<br/>&gt; not something you&apos;re likely to have discovered a critical but<br/>&gt; previously overlooked flaw in.</p><p>Thanks for the article Graham.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When did you exclude other options?  I missed that.  In particular I<br/>&gt; missed your consideration of subharmonic matching and windowed<br/>&gt; autocorrelations.</p><p>My point was that it was not difference tones and the GCD was no less &quot;virtual&quot; than the original sine wave. Concerning subharmonics I&apos;ve already shown in previous posts that they still have a GCD and are therefore just &apos;harmonics&apos;. And as for autocorrelations, they were not a factor in my original &apos;test&apos; which used the simple oscil in Csound and therefore need not be called as a witness for the defence. (The relationship between the sound produced and my ears did not need an autocorrelation program). IOW in this instance what we are hearing is not the virtual pitch but simply &quot;the pitch&quot;, which is true both in definition and in fact. And since it&apos;s true in at least one case, then it&apos;s something that needs to be taken into account. If we take a simple sine wave y(t) = Acos2pi440t, it gives a nice rounded curve of period (1/440)sec. Add a few harmonics and the shape of the wave changes but the period remains the same. This is perceived by the ear as a change in tone. Finally, take out the original sine wave A440Hz and, provided that at least two of the remaining harmonics are relatively prime, then the shape of the wave changes but the period does not. And of course this is perceived as a change in tone.</p><p>Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll notice that Terhardt talks about bells.  They&apos;re one common<br/>&gt; timbre that can be written as tones with integer frequency<br/>&gt; relationships, but where the GCD gives you the wrong pitch.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; been known for as long as I&apos;ve been alive, and the GCD theory has been<br/>&gt; in the doghouse as a result.  Now you&apos;re bringing it out into the open<br/>&gt; again, you must have found something new.

You haven&apos;t answered what happens<br/>&gt; when the &quot;frequency&quot; is subsonic.  -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>I have but its just that you&apos;re not applying what you already know to the extended definition of frequency. The question of audibility/inaudibility is the same as it always has been for sine waves. It depends on choice of frequency range (above 20Hz) and relative amplitudes as usual, but with the additional clause of proximity of the partials to the GCD. For example, since we are assuming that the partials are in the audible range, if we choose small numbers such as 3 and 5 then these are close to the GCD 1 and it too will likely lie within the audible range. However, this begins to break down for higher harmonics as the relative position of the GCD moves farther away. It will also be inaudible if the 3 and 5 are too close to 20Hz.</p><p>To refer back the GEN 10 example I sent with frequency A440Hz, taking harmonics 0 0 1 0 1, that is the 3rd and 5th harmonics with unit amplitude of 1, produces a very clear A440Hz:</p><p>&lt;CsScore&gt;<br/>; Table #1: a simple sine wave (using GEN10).<br/>f 1 0 16384 10 0 0 1 0 1</p><p>This is as clear as if we chose the 1st harmonic:</p><p>&lt;CsScore&gt;<br/>; Table #1: a simple sine wave (using GEN10).<br/>f 1 0 16384 10 1</p><p>To test the results, try the 3rd and 5th harmonics on their own where we&apos;ll hear a distinct E1320Hz and C#2200Hz note:</p><p>f 1 0 16384 10 0 0 1</p><p>and</p><p>f 1 0 16384 10 0 0 0 0 1.</p><p>I&apos;ve tested it up to the 19th harmonic using only two consecutive relative primes and the A440Hz can still be distinctly heard, though it begins to sounds very thin and piercing. Here&apos;s 17 and 19:</p><p>f 1 0 16384 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1.</p><p>To conclude on this point, we wouldn&apos;t say that all sine waves are not real because some of them happen to lie within the subsonic range. The same applies to the GCD. However, two other possibilities now present themselves. The first is that in the case where the waveform frequency (now synonymous with GCD) is subsonic, the ear still recognises the tonic when we play one of its 8ve equivalents that do lie within the audible range. The second possibility is that there is a greater association between tempo and harmony than was previously thought. If we treat tempo just like a subsonic frequency - that is, we treat note durations like quarter notes and eighth notes like periods - then the number of cycles represents the interval between the two frequencies. For example, C256Hz played for 2 seconds gives 512 cycles which is also the ratio between 256Hz and 0.5Hz. It says that the audible C is the &quot;512th harmonic&quot; of the tempo C. The vertical &apos;harmonic&apos; and horizontal &apos;temporal&apos; aspects of a musical score are now unified much like a cycles-time graph, and frequency is the &apos;slope of the line&apos;. This is useful for mathematical wave analysis if not for musical composition (for example, it is the &apos;vt&apos; part of a sine wave cos2pivt).</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2009 1:34:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Okay Carl, below you stated &quot;I believe I was the one who pointed out that it [the GCD] can&apos;t apply to irrationals&quot;. How you would think I wouldn&apos;t know this is truly beyond me. Lets&apos; just say I&apos;ve &apos;known&apos; about it since the early nineties. And now I see that you don&apos;t fully appreciate what we&apos;re really dealing with if waves are truly irrational.</p><p>Since all periodic waves require a GCD between rationals then it follows automatically that all irrationals must by definition be aperiodic. Mathematically speaking, we could have a nice periodic infinite trigonometric series and throw just one truly irrational number in to make the entire wave completely aperiodic. This would mean that for an infinite amount of time no two consecutive waves would repeat. Or in other words, we could never pin-down an exact frequency. Scientists have had a computer running since, I think the early eighties, calculating PI to all its decimal places and, as far as I know, it&apos;s still going strong. And this is just for ONE irrational number. Let us now consider ALL irrational numbers.</p><p>According to Georg Cantor, the number of irrational numbers (aleph-one or uncountable infinity) is so vastly superior when compared to the number of rational numbers (aleph-naught or countable infinity) that if we were to throw a dart at random onto a number line then the chances of hitting a rational is zero. Now let us combine two relative irrationals, then three and so on up to aleph-one. Each one will give a new aperiodic wave completely different from the next. And each of these will be aperiodic to infinity.</p><p>Now I ask you; is THIS how our tempered tunings behave? No. As I&apos;ve said all along they are not irrationals at all but are rationals high up in the series. We &apos;say&apos; sqrt2 but in the real world create something closer to 1.414. It is for this reason I kept on asking you whether Erlich believed the frequencies along the axis were truly continuous. Because this would mean that if we chose an irrational interval arbitrarily close to the small whole-numbered ratio that the wave would become completely aperiodic, and I&apos;m sure that this wasn&apos;t what he intended. In fact in a post to Graham a few months back I proposed the hypothesis that much of what we categorise as &apos;noise&apos; might be such irrational waves. Of course I never heard back.</p><p>In contrast, the nice whole numbers seem like an oasis in a chaotic desert. Harmony is something to be nurtured and valued. As Kronecker, Cantor&apos;s maths teacher and eventual nemesis, said, &quot;God created the natural numbers, mankind created the rest&quot;.

ALL were heard<br/>&gt; &gt; distinctly as A440Hz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve been asked several times about the pitch of things<br/>&gt; like piano tones and bells.  Your method often gives a<br/>&gt; subsonic &quot;pitch&quot; for such tones.  Why you keep ignoring<br/>&gt; this point is beyond me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And when we extend this via harmonic entropy, a whole new<br/>&gt; &gt;horizon of possibilities might open up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, I&apos;ve asked for an example of this but you haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; provided one.

It was this that attracted<br/>&gt; &gt;me to HE in the first place and why I asked for your help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s where things go haywire.  As Mike B. said, this line<br/>&gt; of inquiry is certainly interesting, but it&apos;s a long way<br/>&gt; from producing anything tangible.  All of us would be more<br/>&gt; than interested if you were to present something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then HE must apply to the harmonic series itself.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Look at it another way. In the real world a piano string is<br/>&gt; &gt; not perfectly flexible so the harmonics 2, 3,...are not that<br/>&gt; &gt; exact. HE would apply to them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonic entropy measures the uncertainty of a dyad&apos;s<br/>&gt; virtual pitch.  That&apos;s all.  Implicitly, the dyad can be<br/>&gt; two sine tones or two pitched complex tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We could take approximate values for the relative primes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3,5,7,...above and we should still hear something closer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to A440Hz. Or to use your previous example, although 201Hz,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 301Hz, 401Hz will have a GCD of 1Hz, since 1 is smal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l compared to the component frequencies, then by HE what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we will actually hear is something closer to 100Hz.

It began with my initial Csound experiment which showed once and for all that, as predicted by wave theory, we do actually hear the GCD as the pitch-frequency; provided it&apos;s in the audible range and not covered over by other factors, then we hear it just as plain as any old sine wave. Now others are trying to convince me that this is just the &quot;virtual pitch&quot; that has been well-known for 50 years. However, I don&apos;t believe this to be true.</p><p>The only difference between a pure sine wave of A440Hz and a GCD complex wave of the same frequency is the shape of the wave which alters the tone. The question of its amplitude i.e. loudness, and audible range is independent from questions of periodicity just as it is with sine waves. Therefore, it&apos;s no more or less &quot;virtual&quot; than the notion of pitch-frequency itself. And IMO it begins to explain musical tonality, the ability to hear the tonic, far more realistically than the virtual pitch theory. After all, it is the actual frequency of the wave!</p><p>Now, since the GCD has been proven to be synonymous with &apos;frequency&apos; itself, it follows that both sub-harmonics and difference tones are also subject to the GCD. Given any finite collection of sub-harmonics 1/2, 1/3, ...there will still be a GCD (equal to the lcm of their denominators eg 1/2 and 1/3 have gcd 1/6). And difference tones, being the difference between two frequencies, now means the difference between two GCD&apos;s.

After all,<br/>&gt; it is the actual frequency of the wave!</p><p>No.</p><p>A time domain signal is going to be split up in the ear into several<br/>time domain signals. If you take sinusoids of frequency 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,<br/>7, and 8, each with decreasing amplitude, and add them together,<br/>you&apos;ll &quot;hear&quot; frequency 1 in the signal even though an actual SINE<br/>WAVE with that frequency isn&apos;t present. This is what is referred to as<br/>the &quot;missing fundamental&quot; or &quot;virtual fundamental&quot; or &quot;phantom<br/>fundamental&quot; or &quot;virtual pitch&quot; or anything like that. Even though &quot;1&quot;<br/>isn&apos;t present, you perceive it anyway. This is because the brain is<br/>doing some type of analysis on those waves and arriving at &quot;1&quot; for the<br/>best fit for that series.</p><p>A friend of mine studying neurobiology told me it had something to do<br/>with cells in the ear that track repeating patterns in the original<br/>signal (or maybe it was cells in the brain). This means that some type<br/>of autocorrelation might be utilized in this analysis.</p><p>And everything you&apos;re saying IS the virtual pitch theory! You haven&apos;t<br/>done anything except propose that we use the word &quot;frequency&quot; to refer<br/>to the fundamental of a periodic wave. It&apos;s referred to as &quot;virtual&quot;<br/>because again, no actual SINE WAVE of that frequency is present in the<br/>signal, and so the hair cells in the ear that would resonate at a sine<br/>wave of that frequency won&apos;t resonate (except perhaps for a little bit<br/>due to nonlinearities present somewhere). Nonetheless, your brain is<br/>going to perceive that pitch anyway. And, this is a process that you<br/>have some control over - you can &quot;imagine&quot; a root or fundamental<br/>underneath a given chord and your brain will attempt to place the<br/>chord information accordingly in the harmonic series resulting from<br/>your imagined root and the chord.</p><p>&gt; Now, since the GCD has been proven to be synonymous with &apos;frequency&apos; itself,<br/>&gt; it follows that both sub-harmonics and difference tones are also subject to<br/>&gt; the GCD. Given any finite collection of sub-harmonics 1/2, 1/3, ...there<br/>&gt; will still be a GCD (equal to the lcm of their denominators eg 1/2 and 1/3<br/>&gt; have gcd 1/6). And difference tones, being the difference between two<br/>&gt; frequencies, now means the difference between two GCD&apos;s. Because the maths<br/>&gt; is quite simple, the gaps in your knowledge are probably not as wide as the<br/>&gt; some would have you believe.</p><p>The GCD hasn&apos;t been &quot;proven&quot; to be anything. You have decided that you<br/>want to use the word &quot;frequency&quot; to refer to the inverse of the period<br/>of a periodic wave. That&apos;s fine, and sometimes it&apos;s used that way. And<br/>keep in mind that if you have a chord with frequencies of 4:5.001:6,<br/>you&apos;re going to perceive it as 4:5:6 in all cases, perhaps with a<br/>slowly changing phase shift or some kind of beating in the 5 over<br/>time. The fact that the brain chooses to take this perspective instead<br/>of actually locking the chord in at 4000:5001:6000 is fairly arbitrary<br/>and reflects nothing mathematically fundamental about the nature of<br/>&quot;waves&quot; or anything like that. After all, nature doesn&apos;t give a damn<br/>about the scaling we use on the time axis. And if you take a chord<br/>with cents 0-350-702, it&apos;s so ambiguous that you can flip your<br/>perspective around to hear it as 4:5:6 or 10:12:15 or 16:19:24 or<br/>whatever you&apos;d like. The GCD doesn&apos;t seem to have a monopoly on your<br/>perception there.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2009 1:16:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The over-riding problem in this thread was not to explain the<br/>&gt; virtual pitch.

The pecking order is: wave (quantum) mechanics - chemistry - biochemistry - biology.

It was this loss of perspective which made Graham decide that what I was saying was true but &quot;unimportant&quot;.

So please reciprocate that respect.</p><p>Now I&apos;ve already proven, both theoretically and experimentally, that the pitch detection algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm gone unrecognised for almost 2000 years (whatever else may be true, it&apos;s case closed on that point). The fact that the maths is &apos;known&apos; to any high school student is beside the point. Because mathematicians from Euclid onwards didn&apos;t have the necessary background knowledge in wave theory to interpret it correctly and therefore decided for the rest of us that it must be a &quot;thing in itself&quot;. Looking over the article you sent I see the same old unquestioned assumptions going on. The placement of the microphone relative to the speakers measured in feet rather than wavelengths (or perhaps only as an afterthought when it happens to be convenient), the fact that all algorithms are based in numbers which grew out of wave theory and not vice-versa, and of course the assumption that the equations which were originally designed to emulate real analogue waves in a digital environment are now also taken as a &quot;thing in itself&quot;. Therefore I already know in advance that IF the pitch detection algorithms you sent work then they are unwittingly modelling the real-wave Euclidean algorithm in one way or another. And as I said, Paul&apos;s original assumption that the test subjects in HE were hearing a &quot;virtual pitch&quot; now need to be reconsidered, so the HE experiments were really showing the extent to which we can detune the GCD. Scratch beneath the surface and this is what&apos;s really going on.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2009 1:10:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Both yourself and Graham have said that &quot;virtual pitch&quot; has<br/>&gt; been a well-known phenomenon for 50 years.

The position seems to be that difference tones, subharmonics and GCD can satisfactorily explain the virtual pitch in some, perhaps many, cases but what we are looking for is a theory that can explain it in all cases.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Group members may be interested in this (found via Google of course):<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.chameleo">http://www.chameleo</a> <a href="http://ngroup.org">ngroup.org</a>. uk/research/ link_virtual_ analysis. html<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Steve M.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Steve,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The over-riding problem in this thread was not to explain the virtual pitch. It began with my initial Csound experiment which showed once and for all that, as predicted by wave theory, we do actually hear the GCD as the pitch-frequency; provided it&apos;s in the audible range and not covered over by other factors, then we hear it just as plain as any old sine wave. Now others are trying to convince me that this is just the &quot;virtual pitch&quot; that has been well-known for 50 years. However, I don&apos;t believe this to be true.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only difference between a pure sine wave of A440Hz and a GCD complex wave of the same frequency is the shape of the wave which alters the tone. The question of its amplitude i.e. loudness, and audible range is independent from questions of periodicity just as it is with sine waves. Therefore, it&apos;s no more or less &quot;virtual&quot; than the notion of pitch-frequency itself. And IMO it begins to explain musical tonality, the ability to hear the tonic, far more realistically than the virtual pitch theory. After all, it is the actual frequency of the wave!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, since the GCD has been proven to be synonymous with &apos;frequency&apos; itself, it follows that both sub-harmonics and difference tones are also subject to the GCD. Given any finite collection of sub-harmonics 1/2, 1/3, ...there will still be a GCD (equal to the lcm of their denominators eg 1/2 and 1/3 have gcd 1/6). And difference tones, being the difference between two frequencies, now means the difference between two GCD&apos;s. Because the maths is quite simple, the gaps in your knowledge are probably not as wide as the some would have you believe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2009 7:06:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Newsflash: theoretical physics is off-topic for this list.<br/>&gt;Not that you&apos;re guilty of doing any.<br/>    Hmm....I get a strong impression what Rick was saying is wave mechanics is the top of the order not theoretical physics...and it just happens the wave mechanics hint at theoretical physics.

The point again though seems obvious; both can be used to help music and, on the side, both seem to point strongly toward periodicity as a basis, though not the only basis, of consonance (I think at least we can agree on that).</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2009 3:10:45 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re:Defend your rights with the GCD</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Both yourself and Graham have said that &quot;virtual pitch&quot; has<br/>&gt; been a well-known phenomenon for 50 years.

I was in the middle of working out an answer to the paper you sent.</p><p>It is believed that the sine wave is the elementary starting point of Fourier analysis.

Could it be that waves bring their own measure of time in the form of period/frequency?<br/>Now, let us assume that our original sine wave represents one of the component sine waves in a Fourier series f(t) = f(t + T). It is usually believed that the periodicity of f(t) is given in advance and is independent of the component waves. Yet if we substitute this new n-dependent integral form of the wave into the Fourier coefficients, we find that this is not the case at all. Try it! Since the periodicity of the components on the right side of the equation require the GCD, then so does the original function. Hence, Fourier series depends upon the GCD and not the other way around. And it is not difficult to apply the same method to the Fourier transform and all of its variants (but of course they are no longer periodic).</p><p>So you see that what I&apos;m saying doesn&apos;t actually disagree with the results of what you say, only the interpretation.

In fact, it&apos;s been discussed<br/>&gt; so much that I can foresee only three possible outcomes to this whole<br/>&gt; conversation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) You realize that your reframing of the virtual pitch phenomenon is<br/>&gt; equivalent to your choosing to use different terminology than what is<br/>&gt; common<br/>&gt; 2) We all stop responding because we&apos;re tired of a pointless argument<br/>&gt; that is clearly going nowhere<br/>&gt; 3) The debate continues until various list members start posting about<br/>&gt; how their inboxes are flooded and how they&apos;re leaving the tuning list<br/>&gt; forever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am by no means a veteran on this list, having been here for a year,<br/>&gt; but this seems to be the general pattern. Shall we attempt to avoid<br/>&gt; number three?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Mike,</p><p>I do wish to avoid 3) and apologise if I have offended. I do get a little frustrated sometimes because I&apos;m just not getting the 4th possibility across, that it really isn&apos;t the virtual pitch at work here at all but something quite different. Yet at the same time this doesn&apos;t disprove virtual pitch in the slightest. IOW it&apos;s not 1) and therefore we don&apos;t need 2).</p><p>Referring to the original experiment, it would be described by the sine waves like y(t) = sin2pi440Hz*t, y(t) = sin2pi1320Hz*t + sin2pi2200Hz*t, that is, the 3rd and 5th partials of A440Hz, then the 5th and 7th, 7th and 11th, and so on through the relative primes. All waves have the same maximum unit amplitude and a period of T = 440Hz^-1. Hence, they all vibrate at the GCD frequency A440Hz. If we plot a graph of y-t for these waves, it is seen that the shape of each wave changes but have the same period. Of course a change in shape means a change in tone. Listening to the waves, all have a frequency of A440Hz and the tones thin out the higher up we go in the series, all as expected.</p><p>Now, the energy arriving at the ear drum is defined by the intensity, which is energy in joules per sq meter. It&apos;s equation is<br/>I = Z[dy/dt]^2 where Z is a coefficient for air and depends on pressure and temperature. As we see, the GCD waves do not necessarily contain less energy than the sine wave of A440Hz, at least not enough in this instance to effect their audibility. And if we wish to calculate average energy, then this involves taking the definite integral of energy with respect to time over one period, which is now of course the GCD T = 440Hz^-1, and multiplying frequency, again the GCD. Therefore, knowledge of this must be presumed before an energy calculation can take place. A calculation of these energies would show that they all lie within the same range.</p><p>Finally, in order to prove that it is the virtual pitch and not the GCD we are hearing, we would have to find a way to recreate the same set of circumstances without the GCD being present, which is clearly impossible. By Occam&apos;s Razor, the simplest explanation is that we are hearing the GCD. This does not disprove virtual pitch and I have no doubt that this too plays a vital role in harmonic analysis.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2009 10:04:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I admit...I haven&apos;t heard any counter-theories either, only<br/>&gt; &gt;alternative explanations such as the theory of Virtual Pitch<br/>&gt; &gt;(which is, if I have it right, simply that you will hear the<br/>&gt; &gt;base frequency of who&apos;s harmonic overtones best align with the<br/>&gt; &gt;frequencies given).

For example, I can conceive that two violins, say, each with a well defined harmonic series starting from 1, could both play upper harmonics to some other fundamental and that the resultant wave the listener hears is the GCD. One could play the Fourier series starting from E1320Hz and the other from C#2200Hz and the resultant wave is A440Hz. This, as you know, might give us a clue as to what musicians call &quot;the key&quot;. The music is in &quot;the key&quot; of A. It is common that musicians tend to recognise the key even when the note has not been played, and the summation of all these combinations in a musical composition will all accumulate in the listeners mind to build that sense of &quot;A&quot;. Of course many will claim that in this case it is the virtual tonic at work and they might be correct, or partly correct. My only defence is that something about it &quot;feels&quot; right, that part of me who is a musician I mean. It is not sufficient, for example, to study the wave harmony of an entire orchestra by focusing in on one instrument (and I do think that classical mechanics is guilty of this).</p><p>Concerning 301/201, if we momentarily accept for the sake of argument that the GCD model is correct and that what we are hearing in ET&apos;s are approximations to these, then my intuition tells me that we would hear this as around 100Hz. Looking at a wave graph, if we begin with the idealistic wave 300/200 = 3/2, which of course would repeat every T = 100Hz^-1, and begin to slightly detune one of the notes,it is seen that the overall wave shape changes very little. To me this suggests the possibility of an &quot;almost GCD&quot; model. But of course trying to pin this down in some rigorous way is like asking &quot;how near is almost, exactly?&quot;. How far can I detune my A string before it sounds out of tune, or before it becomes another note completely? Difficult questions. The only thought that comes to mind at the moment is that Erlich&apos;s HE applies to both harmonics and the resultant GCD simultaneously and that what he called virtual pitch might be wholly or in part this waveform frequency. This of course is not a problem; theories are always being modified in light of new evidence or possibilities and still remain largely intact. If anyone has a better idea I&apos;d love to hear it.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3>gooeyfruitbat69 &#x3C;zhang@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2009 9:23:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This topic seems to come up quite often on this list (and other similar forums).

For a few dollars I can buy recordings of the best musicians in the world, some of whom are long gone from us.</p><p>The more I listen the more I can hear the wit, pathos, and intellectual complexity that connects the Australian aborigine&sup1;s didjeridoo and the European conductor&sup1;s baton, and<br/>the more I realize there is only one pair of ears.</p><p>What continually amazes me is the fierce love of harmonic resonance that is evident everywhere. Not all music has the complex tonal system or the counterpoint of the European legacy, or the modal variety of India, or the rhythmic complexity of Ghana, but everywhere one listens one hears the same passionate intelligence. The most subtle conceivable nuances of intonation are shared worldwide. It becomes apparent that our one pair of ears recognizes how wide harmonic territories can be traversed by small melodic intervals.</p><p>Even in music that does not require commas, micro-intervals that<br/>radically affect the harmonic flow show up again and again. This is true for the best musicians regardless of culture or style - the hip pop singer in the recording booth no less than the muezzin in the tower or cellist in the concert hall.</p><p>Worldwide listening reveals that master musicians sing and play the gamut running from the dead-in-tuneness of low-prime norms, through harmonic complexities of every sort, all the way to momentary, deliberate out-of-tuneness.</p><p>Playing with simple pure harmonies is like playing with light, and the fascination with that cusp between complexity and out-of-tuneness is like playing with the dark side.</p><p>The flirtation between the light and the dark is a kind of confrontation with destiny itself, a reenactment of the battle between survival and annihilation, harmony and noise. We cherish this in our music.</p><p>As long as we are singing about life and death we know we are still alive. The various commas, whether they are used as expressive shading or as a functional way of zapping through harmonic territory, far from being the pesky problems that many theorists have assumed them to be, are in fact windows to the affective dark side of the psyche, and they enable music to fill up to the brim with the full range of human feeling.</p><p>Even the commas implicit in twelve-tone equal temperament imbue<br/>equal-tempered music with a tremendous range of human response. We need to elevate the status of the equal-tempered comma from that of a pun, where a single thing stands for two incidentally related things, to that of matchmaker, where complementary energies are conjoined and synthesized into a higher meaning.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consonance and dissonance in music are dependent on culture (not<br/>&gt; every music culture found chords), musical style, tuning, and<br/>&gt; context.

The notion of &quot;complexity&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; I posted above refers only to the second one.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another interesting idea I&apos;ve been throwing around - is &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and &quot;dissonance&quot; really a linear thing when you get into triads and<br/>&gt; &gt; such? Perhaps it&apos;s more like color: we could describe how &quot;colorful&quot; a<br/>&gt; &gt; certain shade of color is, with gray being the least colorful and any<br/>&gt; &gt; highly saturated shade being the most colorful, but we would be losing<br/>&gt; &gt; information on precisely which way the shade is &quot;colored&quot; (red, green,<br/>&gt; &gt; turquoise). Perhaps there are different &quot;flavors&quot; of consonance when<br/>&gt; &gt; you get to triads and beyond, and this would more fully describe a<br/>&gt; &gt; given chord beyond whether as a whole it&apos;s &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or how &quot;complex&quot; or what not.
