With lots of<br/>other tunings, a diatonic set is a given -- for example, 22-tET, at least<br/>in a neo-Gothic approach where 436 cents or 273 cents fits in neatly as an<br/>interesting kind of regular third.</p><p>In 20-tET, a diatonic scale is more of an invention, so to speak, and<br/>comparing notes as we&apos;ve done offlist can be educational all around.</p><p>During a recent discussion of Ben Johnston notation, I was tempted to<br/>remark that my 20-tET keyboard notation spells a perfect fifth as C#-A or<br/>D-Bb. Curiously, we both seem drawn to Mixolydian in this tuning.</p><p>The usual diatonic semitone of 1/20 octave or 60 cents in my neo-Gothic<br/>approach is quite narrow (close to 28:27, as you noted in one post some<br/>time back I found in the List archives), and not far from the regular<br/>diatonic semitone of 22-tET in a neo-Gothic or &quot;Pythagorean-like&quot;<br/>arrangement at 1/22 octave or ~54.55 cents.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ve made this article a priority item on my neo-Gothic<br/>tunings agenda.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
