Even the title &quot;The<br/>Music of Antiquity Reduced for Modern Practice,&quot; is characteristic.<br/>Don Nicola Vicentino, a priest from Vicenza and a pupil of Adrian<br/>Willaert, the famous Netherland chapelmaster at St. Mark&apos;s church in<br/>Venice, was a zealous advocate of everything which he considered<br/>ancient music.  In 1546 he published a collection of &apos;chromatic&apos;<br/>madrigals, as he called them, and in the theoretical work just<br/>mentioned he demonstrated, according to the ancient models, not only<br/>the diatonic but also the chromatic and enharmonic tonal systems...<br/>[cut]... Vicentino emphasizes, for example, that in the composition<br/>of madrigals, among other things, little depends upon the pedantic<br/>maintenance of the mode and the like; most important is to see that<br/>life and breath be given the text by the tones and that the music<br/>express the passions and feelings, bitter as well as mild, cheerful<br/>as well as melancholy...&quot;</p><p>__________ _____ ______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
