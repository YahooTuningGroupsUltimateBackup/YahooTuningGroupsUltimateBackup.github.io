Regular 11-flavor sonorities<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>As discussed in Part I, the e-based tuning is located in a central<br/>region of the spectrum between Pythagorean and 17-tET where major and<br/>minor thirds have ratios in the general area of 14:11 and 13:11,<br/>therefore known as the &quot;11-flavor&quot; region. This region extends from<br/>around 29-tET (fifths ~703.45 cents, ~1.49 cents wide) to around the<br/>e-based tuning (fifths ~704.61 cents, ~2.65 cents wide).</p><p>In the vicinity of 29-tET, the more &quot;Pythagorean-like&quot; end of the<br/>region, we have a &quot;mild&quot; 11-flavor with minor thirds close to 13:11<br/>(~289.21 cents) and major thirds about midway between the Pythagorean<br/>81:64 (~407.82 cents) and 14:11 (~417.51 cents&gt;.</p><p>In the neighborhood of the e-based tuning, the more &quot;17-tET-like&quot; end,<br/>we have a &quot;strong&quot; 11-flavor: the e-based major third at ~418.43 cents<br/>is slightly larger than 14:11, while the minor third at ~286.18 cents<br/>is closer to 33:28 (~284.45 cents), the fifth complement of 14:11,<br/>than to 13:11.</p><p>To accommodate this &quot;strong&quot; 11-flavor, somewhat more delicate timbral<br/>adjustments may be called for with the e-based tuning than with<br/>Pythagorean or 29-tET: I have found with a synthesizer that milder<br/>plucked-string textures (a &quot;harpsichord lute-stop&quot; kind of effect) and<br/>flute-like registrations can be very pleasing, as can some &quot;choir&quot;<br/>textures.</p><p>The following standard 11-flavor cadences may illustrate these points,<br/>also demonstrating the efficient 76.97-cent diatonic semitones of our<br/>tuning. Here C4 is middle C, numbers in parentheses show vertical<br/>intervals above a given voice in rounded cents, and signed numbers<br/>show the ascending (positive) or descending (negative) melodic motion<br/>of each of the voices:</p><p>     E4 ------  +77 ----- F4                F4  -----  -77 ----- E4<br/>    (209)                (495)             (286)                 (0)<br/>     D4 ------ -209 ----- C4                D4  ----- +209 ----- E4<br/>  (495,286)             (495,0)          (705,418)            (705,705)<br/>     B3 ------  +77 ----- C4                Bb3 -----  -77 ----- A3<br/>(914,705,418)       (1200,705,705)     (991,705,286)         (705,705,0)<br/>     G3 ------ -209 ----- F3                G3  ----- +209 ----- A3</p><p>   (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-5 + M2-4)            (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>Our first cadence, an &quot;intensive&quot; form with ascending melodic<br/>semitones, shows the standard resolutions expanding from major sixth<br/>to octave, major third to fifth, and major second to fourth; the<br/>middle two voices contract from minor third to unison. Each resolution<br/>involves in this tuning a total expansion or contraction of about 286<br/>cents, the size of the minor third.</p><p>Our second cadence similarly shows the standard resolutions by<br/>contraction from minor seventh to fifth and minor third to unison,<br/>with the two middle voices expanding from major third to fifth. Here<br/>we have a &quot;remissive&quot; form with descending semitones.</p><p>Typically these regular 11-flavor sonorities and cadences, with their<br/>intriguingly &quot;accentuated&quot; variation on a usual medieval Pythagorean<br/>tuning, make up the bulk of a musical texture, also providing an<br/>intonational backdrop for other flavors and special effects.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>3.2. 17-flavor or &quot;submajor/supraminor&quot; sonorities<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Tunings in the 11-flavor region from around 29-tET to the e-based<br/>temperament also feature diminished fourths and augmented seconds with<br/>ratios in the general vicinity of 21:17 and 17:14, thus known as<br/>alternative &quot;17-flavor&quot; thirds. These thirds, like their regular<br/>counterparts, vary in hue or shading as we move through different<br/>parts of the region.</p><p>Around 29-tET, we have a &quot;mild&quot; 17-flavor where these thirds differ<br/>from the simple or &quot;valley&quot; ratios of 5:4 and 6:5 about as much as<br/>12-tET thirds do in the opposite direction: supraminor thirds are<br/>narrow of 17:14 (~336.13 cents), and submajor thirds wide of 21:17<br/>(~365.83 cents), by about 5 or 6 cents. With fifths of around 704<br/>cents, these intervals are at or close to 17-based ratios.</p><p>In the e-based tuning, we have a &quot;strong&quot; 17-flavor leaning rather<br/>toward the neutral thirds found in the environs of 17-tET, with the<br/>diminished fourth or submajor third at ~363.14 cents, and the<br/>augmented second or supraminor third at ~341.46 cents.</p><p>These &quot;neutralish&quot; 17-flavor thirds can be quite beautiful. Especially<br/>characteristic is the resolution of a sonority with an outer fifth,<br/>supraminor third below, and submajor third above (~14:17:21):</p><p>     Bb3 ------ +132 ----- B3<br/>    (363)                (705)<br/>     F#3 ------ -209 ----- E3<br/>  (705,341)             (705,0)<br/>     Eb3 ------ +132 ----- E3</p><p>            (m3-1 + M3-5)</p><p>Here the supraminor and submajor third behave much like their regular<br/>counterparts, resolving respectively to the unison and fifth in a<br/>typical 14th-century fashion. In addition to these altered thirds, a<br/>striking feature of this cadence is its of melodic use of the large<br/>chromatic semitone or apotome at ~132.25 cents (Eb3-E3, Bb3-B3) in<br/>place of the usual 76.97-cent diatonic semitone or limma.</p><p>A related type of progression features the resolution of submajor<br/>third to fifth and submajor sixth to octave, with the 132-cent<br/>chromatic semitone again lending a distinctive melodic as well as<br/>vertical quality to the cadence. Here are alternative resolutions for<br/>the sonority F#3-Bb3-Eb4 (~17:21:28) available within a usual 12-note<br/>tuning of Eb-G#:</p><p>     Eb4 ---- +132 ---- E4                Eb4 ---- +209 ---- F4<br/>    (495)              (495)             (495)              (495)<br/>     Bb3 ---- +132 ---- B3                Bb3 ---- +209 ---- C4<br/>  (859,363)          (1200,705)        (859,363)          (1200,705)<br/>     F#3 ---- -209 ---- E3                F#3 ---- -132 ---- F3</p><p>          (M6-8 + M3-5)                        (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>This sonority may resolve either intensively to E3-B3-E4, or<br/>remissively to F3-C4-F4. In the course of a piece, the first<br/>resolution can contrast very surprisingly and effectively with the<br/>routine 11-flavor remissive cadence to the same goal, F3-A3-D4 to<br/>E3-B3-E4, the second likewise contrasting with the usual intensive<br/>cadence G3-B3-E4 to F3-C4-F4.</p><p>A very special 17-flavor idiom featuring the supraminor sixth or<br/>&quot;Phi-sixth,&quot; so known because of its proximity to the Golden Ratio or<br/>Phi (~833.09 cents), deserves a section of its own (see Section 5,<br/>to appear in Part 3).</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>3.3. The 7-flavor and standard metachromatic cadences<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Extending the e-based tuning to 24 notes reveals, in addition to the<br/>regular 11-flavor and alternative 17-flavor intervals, a set of<br/>7-flavor intervals all within about 5 cents of pure ratios (9:7, 14:9,<br/>7:6, 12:7, 7:4, 8:7). These intervals give the e-based tuning and its<br/>immediate neighborhood a distinctive place on the neo-Gothic spectrum;<br/>built from chains of 13, 14, or 15 fifths or fourths, they resolve<br/>in a characteristic fashion here termed &quot;metachromatic.&quot;</p><p>Illustrating this fashion, the following two 7-flavor progressions<br/>correspond to the regular 11-flavor versions of Section 3.1, with a<br/>near-14:18:21:24 major sixth sonority in the first cadence and a<br/>near-12:14:18:21 minor seventh sonority in the second:</p><p>     F4 ------  +55 ----- F*4               E*4 ----  -55 ----- E4<br/>    (264)                (495)             (264)                (0)<br/>     D*4 ----- -209 ----- C*4               D4  ---- +209 ----- E4<br/>  (495,231)             (495,0)          (705,440)           (705,705)<br/>     C4 ------  +55 ----- C*4               A*3 ----  -55 ----- A3<br/>(936,705,440)       (1200,705,705)     (969,705,264)        (705,705,0)<br/>     G*3 ----- -209 ----- F*3               G3  ---- +209 ----- A3</p><p>   (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-5 + M2-4)            (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>In the first progression, the near-9:7 major third and near-12:7 major<br/>sixth are actually spelled as a fourth (G*3-C4) and minor seventh<br/>(G*3-F4) each reduced by the 55.28-cent diesis separating the two<br/>manuals. The expansion of these large major thirds and sixths to<br/>stable fifths and octaves involves the use of this diesis as a<br/>cadential semitone, here ascending (C4-C*4, F4-F*4), while the other<br/>voices descend by regular whole-tones (G*3-F*3, D*4-C*4).</p><p>Similarly, in the second progression, the near-7:6 minor third G3-A*3<br/>and near-7:4 minor seventh G3-E*4 are spelled as a major second or<br/>sixth enlarged by a 55-cent diesis. These small minor thirds and<br/>sevenths contract to unisons and fifths by way of cadential diesis<br/>motions, here descending (A*3-A3, E*3-E3), while the other voices<br/>again move by usual 209-cent whole-tone steps (G3-A3, D3-E3).</p><p>The defining feature of a &quot;metachromatic&quot; progression is that the<br/>interval separating the two keyboards of a 24-note tuning, here the<br/>usual e-based diesis, serves as a small cadential semitone.[9] This<br/>arrangement leads to engaging cadential geometries sometimes enhancing<br/>usual patterns of musical structure or modality, and sometimes<br/>inviting sequences with a logic of their own, quite distinct from that<br/>of accustomed Gothic patterns.</p><p>Surveying first some standard cadential patterns, let us consider<br/>alternative resolutions for the 7-flavor sonorities of our previous<br/>example, with G*3-C4-D*4-F4 here resolving in a remissive manner<br/>(descending diesis motions), and G3-A*3-D4-E*4 in an intensive manner<br/>(ascending diesis motions):</p><p>     F4 ------ +209 ----- G4               E*4 ---- -209 ----- D*4<br/>    (264)                (495)            (264)                (0)<br/>     D*4 -----  -55 ----- D4               D4  ----  +55 ----- D*4<br/>  (495,231)             (495,0)          (705,440)           (705,705)<br/>     C4 ------ +209 ----- D4               A*3 ---- -209 ----- G*3<br/>(936,705,440)       (1200,705,705)     (969,705,264)        (705,705,0)<br/>     G*3 -----  -55 ----- G3               G3  ----  +55 ----- G*3</p><p>   (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-5 + M2-4)           (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>Comparing these progressions with the previous ones will demonstrate a<br/>general trait of metachromatic progressions: intensive progressions<br/>resolve to sonorities on the upper manual, and remissive progressions<br/>to sonorities on the lower manual.</p><p>In full four-voice resolutions of the kind we are now considering with<br/>all unstable intervals resolving by stepwise contrary motion, one pair<br/>of voices move together in fifths or fourths while remaining on the<br/>same manual, ascending or descending by a regular whole-tone: in our<br/>current example, C4-F4 to D4-G4 (first cadence) or A*3-E*3 to G*3-D*3<br/>(second cadence).</p><p>The other pair of voices, also in parallel fifths or fourths, move<br/>together by a diesis from one keyboard to the other: here G*3-D*4 to<br/>G3-D4 (first cadence) or G3-D4 to G*3-D*4 (second cadence). This<br/>motion thus takes us to a stable sonority on the lower keyboard in a<br/>remissive cadence, and on the upper keyboard in an intensive cadence.</p><p>In three-voice versions of these cadences -- three voices being most<br/>typical in the 13th-14th century era, and also in many neo-Gothic<br/>textures -- two voices likewise move together in fifths or fourths by<br/>a whole-tone while the third voice moves in contrary motion by a<br/>diesis, or vice versa. To get an idea of some of the permutations, let<br/>us consider intensive and remissive resolutions for the major sixth<br/>sonority A*3-D4-G4 (near-7:9:12) and the minor seventh sonority<br/>C4-D*4-A*4 (near-12:14:21):</p><p>                           intensive resolutions</p><p>     G4 -----  +55 ---- G*4                A*4 ---- -209 ---- G*4<br/>    (495)              (495)              (705)              (705)<br/>     D4 -----  +55 ---- D*4                D*4 ---- -209 ---- C*4<br/>  (936,440)          (1200,705)         (969,264)           (705,0)<br/>     A*3 ---- -209 ---- G*3                C4 -----  +55 ---- C*4</p><p>          (M6-8 + M3-5)                        (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>                         remissive resolutions</p><p>     G4 ----- +209 ---- A4                A*4 ----  -55 ---- A4<br/>    (495)              (495)             (705)              (705)<br/>     D4 ----- +209 ---- E4                D*4 ----  -55 ---- D4<br/>  (936,440)          (1200,705)         (969,264)          (705,0)<br/>     A*3 ----  -55 ---- A3                C4 ----- +209 ---- D4</p><p>          (M6-8 + M3-5)                        (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>All of these 7-flavor cadences in three and four voices share a<br/>&quot;superefficient&quot; quality: directed two-voice resolutions involve a<br/>total expansion (M2-4, M3-5, M6-8) or contraction (m3-1, m7-5) of only<br/>about 264.5 cents, the sum of the regular 209.2-cent whole-tone and<br/>superincisive 55.3-cent diesis steps by which the two parts progress<br/>in contrary motion. This total distance of expansion or contraction is<br/>also equal to the size of the 7-flavor minor third, an interval built<br/>from whole-tone-plus-diesis (e.g. G3-A*3 or C4-D*3).</p><p>Often 7-flavor progressions are introduced here and there to provide a<br/>touch of variety and accentuated cadential action in a texture<br/>otherwise pervaded by 11-flavor or 17-flavor sonorities and<br/>resolutions. Additionally, however, they can be used for sequences and<br/>other special effects whose geometries unite the two keyboards in new<br/>ways.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>4. Metachromatic sequences and related idioms<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>One definitely _neo_-Gothic approach to metachromatic cadences in the<br/>e-based and other tunings is to string a chain or sequence of such<br/>cadences together into a kind of progression quite different from<br/>13th-14th century practice.</p><p>Other idioms involve the &quot;superfourth&quot; or small diminished fifth<br/>formed from fourth-plus-diesis, or the use of unexpected metachromatic<br/>&quot;shifts&quot; to divert a familiar progression in a most unaccustomed<br/>direction, or melodic shifts of a 21.67-cent &quot;subdiesis&quot; or &quot;17-comma&quot;<br/>defining the distance between such &quot;near-equivalent&quot; notes on the two<br/>manuals as F3 and E*3. Also, the 7-flavor or near-14:9 minor sixth<br/>formed from a fifth-plus-diesis (e.g. G3-D*4) lends itself to some<br/>notable progressions.</p><p>----------------------------<br/>4.1. Metachromatic sequences<br/>----------------------------</p><p>Chaining together a series of metachromatic cadences produces a<br/>sequence like this, here using remissive resolutions of minor seventh<br/>sonorities, with each note sustained until the next note or the<br/>conclusion of the passage (||) is indicated, with a link to a MIDI<br/>version produced with Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala program (the lynx<br/>browser for UNIX had problems with this direct URL, but successfully<br/>downloaded the file through the &quot;Files&quot; menu of the group Tuning):</p><p>                                           ||<br/>C4  D*4  D4  E*4  E4  F#*4  F#4  G#*4  G#4<br/>C4       D4       E4        F#4        G#4<br/>F3  G*3  G3  A*3  A3  B*3   B3   C#*4  C#4<br/>F3       G3       A3        B3         C#4</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Schulter%20sound%20files/eb7cr01.mid">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Schulter%20sound%20files/eb7cr01.mid</a></p><p>This kind of sequence has a logic of its own, with a &quot;floating&quot;<br/>quality not necessarily tied to any particular vertical or modal<br/>center. The lowest and third-lowest voices characteristically progress<br/>in ascending whole-tones (e.g. F3-G3-A3-B3-C#4 in the lowest voice), a<br/>procedure which might recall the whole-tone scales of Debussy and<br/>other composers around 1900.[10]</p><p>The second-lowest and highest voices have a complementary pattern of<br/>alternating motions, first ascending by a near-7:6 minor third to move<br/>from a stable vertical fifth to an unstable ~12:14:18:21 sonority, and<br/>then descending by a diesis in the remissive resolution of this<br/>sonority to a new stable fifth.</p><p>While this notation shows the notes and intervals, another approach<br/>can better show the &quot;logic of the hands&quot; involved in realizing this<br/>sequence on a two-manual keyboard.

The lowest and third-lowest<br/>voices _descend_ through four whole-tones (e.g. C#*4-B*3-A*3-G*3-F*3<br/>in the lowest voice), while the other pair of voices alternate motion<br/>by descending near-7:6 minor thirds and ascending cadential dieses.</p><p>These sequences feature strong cadential progressions, but an overall<br/>structure outside the usual diatonic order.

The &quot;superfourth&quot; or small diminished fifth<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Another metachromatic progression involves a sonority combining a<br/>usual 11-flavor minor third (~286.18 cents) plus a 7-flavor minor<br/>third (~264.50 cents) to form an outer inteval of a fourth-plus-diesis<br/>or &quot;superfourth,&quot; to borrow Dave Keenan&apos;s term, at ~550.68 cents, very<br/>close to a pure 11:8 (~551.32 cents).</p><p>Characteristic resolutions involving diesis steps between the two<br/>keyboards are the following, with one of the minor thirds contracting<br/>to a unison and the other expanding to a fifth:</p><p>      E*4 -- +209 -- F#*4             E*4 --  -55 -- E4<br/>    (264)           (705)            (264)          (0)<br/>      D4  -- -231 -- B*3              D4  -- +209 -- E4<br/>  (551,286)        (705,0)         (551,286)      (705,705)<br/>      B3  --  +55 -- B*3              B3  -- -209 -- A3</p><p>         (m3-1 + m3-5)                   (m3-1 + m3-5)</p><p>In the first progression, the regular minor third between the lower<br/>pair of voices (B3-D4) contracts to a unison at B*3, with the lowest<br/>voice ascending by a diesis and the middle voice descending by a large<br/>whole-tone at ~230.90 cents (almost exactly 8:7, ~231.17 cents). The<br/>7-flavor minor third between the upper voices (D4-E*4) expands to a<br/>fifth (B*3-F#*4) by way of this descending motion in the middle voice<br/>coupled with the ascent of the highest voice by a regular whole-tone<br/>of ~209.21 cents.</p><p>In the second progression, the lower pair of voices expand from a<br/>regular minor third B3-D4 to a fifth (A3-E4), each moving by a regular<br/>whole-tone. The small or 7-flavor minor third D4-E*4 between the upper<br/>pair of voices contracts to a unison on E4, with the highest voice<br/>descending by a diesis (E*4-E4).</p><p>The superfourth between the outer voices B3-E*4 itself resolves in<br/>either progression to a stable fifth (B*3-F#*4 or A3-E4) by parallel<br/>motion rather than directed contrary motion; it is the resolutions of<br/>the minor thirds (m3-1, m3-5) which guide the cadential action.</p><p>This is also a very typical cadential role for usual diminished fifths<br/>or augmented fourths in Gothic or neo-Gothic music, lending a striking<br/>color to resolutions where other unstable intervals resolving by<br/>contrary motion play a guiding role.</p><p>To illustrate this point, let us consider progressions with regular<br/>diminished fifths corresponding to the above examples:</p><p>      F4 -- +209 -- G4              F4 --  -77 -- E4<br/>     (286)         (705)          (286)          (0)<br/>      D4 -- -209 -- C4              D4 -- +209 -- E4<br/>  (572,286)       (705,0)       (572,286)      (705,705)<br/>      B3 --  +77 -- C4              B3 -- -209 -- A3</p><p>        (m3-1 + m3-5)                 (m3-1 + m3-5)</p><p>This kind of progression seems rather common in the 13th century,<br/>where Pythagorean tuning provides the intonational norm: the outer<br/>diminished fifth B3-F4 resolves by parallel motion to a fifth, while<br/>one of the minor thirds contracts to a unison and the other expands to<br/>a fifth.[11]</p><p>Substituting the superfourth for the usual diminished fifth does not<br/>seem to change the basic logic of the progression, but does introduce<br/>both the special color of this interval so close to a pure 11:8, and<br/>the metachromatic element of the diesis as an ascending or descending<br/>melodic step.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>9. While the 7-flavor metachromatic progressions of the e-based tuning<br/>use the &quot;natural&quot; 55-cent diesis between the keyboards arising in a<br/>regular 24-note tuning, other types of metachromatic schemes may use<br/>noncontiguous or even &quot;artificially engineered&quot; intervals between the<br/>manuals. In the Pythagorean tricomma tuning, for example, the manuals<br/>are placed at the interval of three Pythagorean commas or a &quot;tricomma&quot;<br/>(~70.38 cents), or 36 pure fifths up, this interval serving in a<br/>metachromatic fashion as a small semitone. In the 24-note variation on<br/>17-tET discussed in Part I, n. 7, two keyboards in Eb-G# tunings are<br/>placed at the arbitrary distance of ~55.11 cents, almost identical to<br/>the e-based diesis, so as to attain pure 7-flavor minor thirds<br/>(e.g. G3-A*3) and major sixths (e.g. G*3-F4) at 7:6 and 12:7.</p><p>10. In this tuning, the chain of four whole-tones F3-G3-A3-B3-C#4 or<br/>C4-D4-E4-F#4-G#4 outlines an augmented fifth F3-C#4 or C4-G#4 with a<br/>size of ~836.86 cents, quite close to Phi at ~833.09 cents. Around<br/>1325, Jacobus of Liege describes a corresponding interval in<br/>Pythagorean tuning, the _tetratonus_ equal to four 9:8 whole-tones<br/>or 6561:4096 (~815.64 cents).</p><p>11. In Pythagorean intonation, these last examples would be:</p><p>      F4 -- +204 -- G4              F4 --  -90 -- E4<br/>     (294)         (702)          (294)          (0)<br/>      D4 -- -204 -- C4              D4 -- +204 -- E4<br/>  (588,294)       (702,0)       (588,294)      (702,702)<br/>      B3 --  +90 -- C4              B3 -- -204 -- A3</p><p>        (m3-1 + m3-5)                 (m3-1 + m3-5)</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
