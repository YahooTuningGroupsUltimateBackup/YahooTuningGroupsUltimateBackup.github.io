As a composer I don&apos;t want other people tinkering or<br/> experimenting with my works, I can&apos;t imagine a composer who would.<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m with you, Kraig.  It&apos;s bad enough that laws have declared that after x<br/>years, a musical work belongs to the &quot;public domain&quot;, although said public<br/>may never have given a damn in support of the composer&apos;s work. (If I were a<br/>painter or sculpture, at least there is a solid object which I can sell to<br/>whomever or keep (and hand down to my children) as I pleased.)   Even worse<br/>is the attitude by players or listeners that they are doing the composer such<br/>a great service by listening to her work that they should not have to be<br/>compensated for the work of producing the work. Worst of all is when players<br/>decide that, in return for granting the composer the service of playing the<br/>music, it is played only with extensive recomposition: new tunings, timbres,<br/>etc..</p><p>I do believe there is a place for visionary transcription or recomposition:<br/>Stravinsky&apos;s Pergolesi, Partch&apos;s Yaquis or von Schweinitz&apos;s Mozart are all<br/>visionary. Mahler&apos;s reorchestrations of Schumann are better than the<br/>originals, and I will never cease to be amazed by Glenn Gould&apos;s Bach (piano<br/>and all).  But this has got to be done with honesty about the nature of the<br/>re-composition, convincing rationale for the critique implied by the project,<br/>and enough touch of inspiration or virtuosity that discussion is unnecessary.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=6743 href="#6743">ðŸ”—</a>Dale Scott &#x3C;adelscott@xxxx.xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 01:24 PM 12/7/99 EST, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In einer Nachricht vom 12/7/99 6:28:25 PM (MEZ) Mitteleurop&#xFFFD;ische<br/>&gt;Zeitschreibt <a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>:</p><p>I will never cease to be amazed by Glenn Gould&apos;s Bach (piano<br/>&gt;and all).</p><p>You&apos;re right.
