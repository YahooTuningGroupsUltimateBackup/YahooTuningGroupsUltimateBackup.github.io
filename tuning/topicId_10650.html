The &quot;a&quot; sounds like the<br/>&quot;u&quot; in &quot;gum&quot;.  So, &quot;raagam&quot; sounds like &quot;raah-gum&quot; -- as if you were<br/>cheering on your chewing gum.  :-)  I use these variations on the terms<br/>somewhat interchangeably, as you&apos;ll notice below.</p><p>As the spouse of a Hindustani classical vocalist from northern India and<br/>the friend of several Indian Hindustani classical and Carnatic classical<br/>musicians, I feel obligated to make a few clarifications about Indian<br/>music and tuning after reading some of the posts here that seem to imply<br/>that Indian music is one big homogeneous system with a consistent set of<br/>ragas, talas, tunings, etc.</p><p>Indian classical music is *NOT* one big homogeneous system with a<br/>consistent set of ragas, talas, tunings, etc.</p><p>From northern India comes system of classical music called Hindustani.<br/>From southern India comes a system of classical music called Carnatic.<br/>They are not the same.  Yes, some Hindustani raags and taals are<br/>similar to some Carnatic raagams and taalams, but for most cases, they<br/>are different.  Even their forms of composition and performance differ.</p><p>Within either system, there are differences in interpretation of raga,<br/>tala, and tuning all the way down to the individual performer and even<br/>to individual performances of the same performer.</p><p>Ethnomusicologists such as Nazir Jairazbhoy have done studies which<br/>showed that, even for common ragas, there is a lot of variability in the<br/>intervals used, even if restricting the comparisons to performances by a<br/>single master performer.  Jairazbhoy and his students have written for<br/>the &quot;Journal of Ethnomusicology&quot;, and Jairazbhoy also has a book out<br/>called &quot;The Rags of North Indian Music : Their Structure and Evolution&quot;<br/>which, if I remember correctly, does get into this subject.  (My copy is<br/>at home and I&apos;m [physically] at work, hence my uncertainty.)</p><p>Here are some more references regarding the variability of intervals in<br/>Indian music that a friend sent during an earlier email exchange I had<br/>with a couple of my south Indian Carnatic musician friends (whilst we<br/>were trying to work out suitable fret positions for the other party&apos;s<br/>Carnatic vina):</p><p>   ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>   Levy, Mark, 1946-<br/>   Intonation in North Indian music : a select comparison of theories<br/>     with contemporary practice / Mark Levy.<br/>   New Delhi : Biblia Impex, 1982.</p><p>   Powers, Harold Stone, 1928-<br/>   The background of the South Indian Raga-system.<br/>   [Ann Arbor, University Microfilms, 1960]</p><p>   Vidya Shankar.<br/>   The art and science of carnatic music / Vidya Shankar. 1st ed.<br/>   Madras : Music Academy Madras, 1983.</p><p>   The Jairazhbhoy and Stone study on intonation in contemporary<br/>   Hindustani music -- particularly relating to the G2 in Yaman -- is<br/>   from the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies.  The<br/>   exact reference should be in the first book listed above... and in<br/>   fact the book above may even carry the entire details from that<br/>   study.</p><p>   ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Also: I believe Dr. Can Akkoc has written about the variability of<br/>intervals in the Turkish classical music system, though I am afraid I do<br/>not have any of his writings.  I remember reading some posts by him on<br/>this list some time ago.  I suspect that the sort of variable interval<br/>phenomenon he observes in Turkish music may be similar to what goes on<br/>in Indian music.</p><p>Dr. Akkoc, are you still on this list?  I would love to get an update on<br/>your research (and reprint[s] of your paper[s]).  Thanks!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div><h3><a id=10652 href="#10652">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@apple.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2000 3:00:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Variability of intervals in Indian music (and related topics)</p><p>Ah!  Thank you!  Something interesting &amp; non-mathematical about MUSIC on the Tuning List... ;-)</p><p>(Personal aside... I listen to a lot of both Hindustani &amp; Carnatic music...
