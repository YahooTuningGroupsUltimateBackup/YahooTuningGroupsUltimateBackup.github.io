For<br/>the general population, the standard deviation of pitch estimation was<br/>very nearly the 1 dB bandwidth of the filter.  However, for subjects who<br/>deemed themselves musicians, the statistical error was much less (maybe<br/>1/3 of the general population).  The overall conclusion was that the<br/>ear/brain does detect the spectral peak of even fairly broad band noise<br/>(I think I used a 3-dB bandwidth of one octave for my broadest<br/>stimulus).  This would seem to support Dave Keenan&apos;s theory for hearing<br/>a &quot;pitch&quot; of delayed/summed white noise, with multiple spectral peaks at<br/>a uniform frequency spacing implying a fundamental at the reciprocal<br/>delay period.</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p></div>
