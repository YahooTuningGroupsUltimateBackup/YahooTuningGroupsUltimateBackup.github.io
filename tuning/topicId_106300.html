Certain some 20th-21st century Near Eastern musicians have<br/>done or advocated such harmonizations, but my own approach to<br/>maqam-based or dastgah-based polyphony is different. And, above<br/>all, I would emphasize that this is mainly monophonic music with<br/>an emphasis on pure melody, although drones and devices such as<br/>parallel fourths or fifths do occur in traditional performances.</p><p>A very widespread pattern for these modes is a small neutral<br/>second maybe at around 13/12 (139 cents), followed by a larger<br/>neutral second maybe at around 12/11 (151 cents) or 128/117 (155<br/>cents), followed by a whole tone at 9/8 (204 cents) or sometimes<br/>a bit larger.</p><p>Marcel, the Pythagorean comma or 53-EDO notation of 6-7-9 commas<br/>very nicely expresses this, and a Pythagorean tuning of<br/>137-157-204 cents would be fine for the kind of Egyptian Bayyati<br/>that Scott Marcus describes with the lower step at around 135-145<br/>cents, as well as for a Syrian school which simply defines the<br/>Bayyati tetrachord as 6-7-9 commas.</p><p>For Persian Shur, Hormoz Farhat suggests something like<br/>135-155-205 cents, interestingly very close to a permutation of<br/>one of Ibn Sina&apos;s favorite tetrachords from the early 11th<br/>century, which gives 13:12-128:117-9:8 or 139-155-204 cents.</p><p>In JI, an attractive form of Bayyati, Ushshak, or Shur has a<br/>13:12:11 division, i.e. 52:48:44:39 or 13:12-12:11-44:39<br/>(139-151-209 cents).</p><p>In 20th-century Turkish theory, which often prefers to avoid<br/>neutral intervals, an alternative form of Ushshak (a name from<br/>Arabic ushshaq, &quot;the lovers,&quot; for a Turkish maqam generally<br/>corresponding to Arab Bayyati) is 8-5-9 commas, or essentially<br/>10:9-16:15-9:8. Note that in this 5-limit interpretation, the<br/>larger or diminished third step comes first. However, even while<br/>this kind of theory was the norm in Turkey, traditional<br/>performers would use an &quot;unofficial&quot; step sometimes called<br/>ushshak, which Karl Signell measured at around 140 cents --<br/>pretty much agreeing with Marcus, Farhat, and the 6-7-9 comma<br/>concept of Syria.</p><p>However, some Near Eastern performers prefer other intonations.<br/>Especially for players of fixed-pitch instruments in the Arab<br/>world where Rast is &quot;the mother of all maqamat,&quot; with a lower<br/>tetrachord at around 9-7-6 commas (e.g. 200-155-145 cents in<br/>Lebanon, according to Amine Beyhom), there is a tendency to leave<br/>the neutral third step of Rast, called sikah (or segah in Persian<br/>and Turkish), unchanged for Bayyati, which becomes 7-6-9 commas,<br/>something like 157-137-204 cents in theory and not too far from<br/>this in practice.</p><p>In part this may be inertia, or the difficulty of retuning sikah<br/>from its Rast position to a lower Bayyati position, but as<br/>fastidious a musician as Tawfiq al-Sabbagh of Syria, much<br/>interested in comma nuances that can make different maqamat more<br/>beautiful, takes 7-6-9 commas as a correct Bayyati. So it would<br/>seem that either 6-7-9 commas or 7-6-9 commas has its place.</p><p>Indeed Beyhom reports that a &quot;classical&quot; Lebanese practice<br/>prefers the first neutral step of Bayyati at around 155 cents<br/>(suggesting 7-6-9 commas or similar approach), but in a &quot;popular&quot;<br/>or &quot;folk&quot; style it is much lower, at 130 cents or so, a<br/>difference of 25 cents.</p><p>There is also the question of whether the minor third should be a<br/>full Pythagorean 32/27 or 13 commas (294 cents), as the formula<br/>of 6-7-9 or 7-6-9 commas would suggest, or somewhat smaller.<br/>Marcus suggests that in Egypt, 32/27 may be about right -- a bit<br/>smaller, in practice, than the 300 cents of 24-equal theory. In<br/>other places, however, the third may be slightly or considerably<br/>narrower. Ali Jihad Racy of Lebanon notes that the third of<br/>Bayyati is smaller than the 32/27 from three pure fourths,<br/>although he does not specify how much smaller -- in Arab thought,<br/>a &quot;comma&quot; can be any small interval, not necessarily any specific<br/>ratio such as 64:63 in this connection, for example (which would<br/>yield a 7/6 third).</p><p>In 1966, Nelly Caron and Dariush Safvate reported a Persian<br/>tuning of Shur, generally analogous to Arab Bayyati, at<br/>136-140-224 cents -- the 276-cent third being about 9 cents wide<br/>of a pure 7/6. More recently, Dariush Tala&grave;i has recommended a<br/>Shur tuning of 140-140-220 cents, for which 17-EDO offers a<br/>reasonable approximation at 141-141-212 cents. Thus equal or<br/>near-equal neutral steps are not necessarily wrong, although<br/>Farhat and the 6-7-9 comma model reflect a widespread preference<br/>that the first step be markedly smaller than the second.</p><p>There are also JI or near-JI models based on ratios involving<br/>prime 13, whose use as an important factor in Near Eastern<br/>tunings goes back to Ibn Sina. Thus a 6-7-9 comma model<br/>(137-157-204 cents) is more or less synonymous with the 13:12:11<br/>division of 52:48:44:39 or 139-151-209 cents. For the kind of<br/>division described by al-Sabbagh at 7-6-9 commas, a division of<br/>33:36:39:44 or 11:12:13 (151-139-209 cents) is synonymous. One<br/>can also use a septimal tuning of 12:13:14:16 (139-128-231 cents)<br/>or 28:26:24:21 (128-139-231 cents) with a 7/6 third.</p><p>Tunings of Shur like those of Dariush Safvate or Dariush Tala&grave;i,<br/>with the third at around 275-280 cents, suggest another JI or<br/>near-JI variation, although with more unequal neutral steps than<br/>the Iranian examples of 136-140-224 cents or an equal 140-140-220<br/>cents. This variation would be 14:13-12:11-143:126 (128-151-219<br/>cents) or the like, with a third at around 168:143 or 279 cents,<br/>a size typical of Iranian music.</p><p>Here&apos;s a tempered tuning of Shur approximating this just division<br/>by steps of 125.4-150.0-220.3 cents. I should add that while Arab<br/>Bayyati, Turkish Ushshak, and Persian Shur share similar lower<br/>tetrachords and some other traits (like a typical minor sixth<br/>degree above the final, but a neutral third below it, a fine<br/>example of octave nonequivalence), each modal form has its own<br/>special characteristics. For example, Persian Shur often replaces<br/>the 3/2 fifth with a lowered or koron step about a thirdtone flat<br/>of this, with 13/9 as one classic ratio, as occurs in this piece.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Homage_to_Dariush_Safvate.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Homage_to_Dariush_Safvate.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Also, a quick note on the Arab and Turkish maqamat. Arab Bayyati<br/>and Turkish Ushshaq are similar. Each has a variation where the<br/>second tetrachord on the 4/3 step, usually Nahawand (9-4-9<br/>commas) or Rast (9-7-6 commas), is replaced by a form of Hijaz.<br/>I often play it at around 4-12-6 commas, although practices can<br/>vary greatly. But the main point here is that in this offshoot<br/>of Bayyati or Ushshak, this Hijaz tetrachord above 4/3 introduces<br/>a smallish tritone somewhere around 1024/729 (588 cents) or maybe<br/>88/63 (578 cents), for example. This note, which would be at some<br/>kind of minor sixth above the step rast (since Bayyati starts on<br/>the 9/8 of Rast, called step dukah in Arabic or dugah in Persian<br/>and Turkish), is called shuri in Arab theory, but beyati in<br/>Turkish theory.</p><p>Thus the Arabs have Maqam Bayyati, with Shuri as the variation<br/>with Hijaz on 4/3, while the Turks have Makam Ushshak with Beyati<br/>as the variation. It can be helpful to remember that Turkish<br/>Beyati corresponds most directly to Arab Shuri, rather than to<br/>Arab Bayyati (the counterpart of Turkish Ushshaq). Persian Shur<br/>is a bit different, and uses a lowered fifth degree -- but not<br/>generally in the context of a Hijaz tetrachord (or Chahargah, as<br/>a similar tetrachord is called in the Persian system, for example<br/>something like 6-12-4 commas or 135-275-85 cents).</p><p>Also, Scott Marcus makes a point that applies to some tendencies<br/>in Turkish as well as Arab intonation: while the neutral second<br/>step of Bayyati or Ushshaq often tends to be small (say 125-145<br/>cents), the neutral sixth, when it&apos;s used, tends to be higher,<br/>say 855-870 cents. This fits with the fact that while a Bayyati<br/>tetrachords is often 6-7-9 commas, the neutral sixth step tends<br/>to occur as part of Rast tetrachord on the 4/3 step, which is<br/>9-7-6 commas or the like. Here&apos;s a tempered tuning with support<br/>the three most common forms of upper tetrachords: Nahawand, Rast,<br/>or Hijaz (the last in the Shuri variation):</p><p>! met24-bayyati9_fsharp.scl<br/>!<br/>Set for Maqam Bayyati and Maqam Shuri<br/> 9<br/>!<br/> 139.45312<br/> 289.45312<br/> 496.87500<br/> 577.73437<br/> 704.29687<br/> 785.15624<br/> 867.18750<br/> 992.57812<br/> 2/1</p><p>For Nahawand on 4/3, we have 497-704-785-993 cents, or<br/>207.4-80.9-207.4 cents, with a minor sixth near 11/7 (or 52/33).<br/>For Rast on 4/3, we have 497-704-867-993 cents, or<br/>207.4-162.9-125.4 cents, with a neutral sixth near 104/63, and at<br/>around a large 32/21 fifth rather than 3/2 from the second degree<br/>of Bayyati at 139 cents, near 13/12. And for Maqam Shuri, with<br/>Hijaz on 4/3, we have 497-578-867-993 cents, or 80.9-289.5-125.4<br/>cents (roughly 21:22:26:28), again using the high neutral sixth<br/>step. A Rast tetrachord with the third at 370 cents or so is<br/>common in some Syrian styles, for example in Aleppo, although<br/>other regions might place this step at 355-360 cents.</p><p>To sum all this up: I would say a model of 6-7-9 commas for<br/>Bayyati, Ushshaq, or Shur is a good place to start, allowing for<br/>a range of fine tunings, and also noting that 7-6-9 commas often<br/>occurs in Arab practice, and is favored by some theorists such as<br/>al-Sabbagh. Some Arab, Turkish, and Persian musicians lean toward<br/>a minor third rather smaller than 32/27, with something subtly<br/>narrower like 13/11 or 33/28 appearing common in Persian<br/>practice, along with some reported or recommended tunings like<br/>276 cents which are closer to 7/6. And I find 12:13:14 or<br/>14:13:12 a very pleasant division, recognized in medieval theory,<br/>which may occur now and then in modern Near Eastern practice.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;marcel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2013 5:43:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>Thank you soo much for this wealth of information!<br/>Will keep this around for reference!</p><p>&gt; Marcel, the Pythagorean comma or 53-EDO notation of 6-7-9 commas<br/>&gt; very nicely expresses this, and a Pythagorean tuning of<br/>&gt; 137-157-204 cents would be fine for the kind of Egyptian Bayyati<br/>&gt; that Scott Marcus describes with the lower step at around 135-145<br/>&gt; cents, as well as for a Syrian school which simply defines the<br/>&gt; Bayyati tetrachord as 6-7-9 commas.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes that&apos;s the one I&apos;m going with for now.

I was a little<br/>surprised to read that even near-eastern performers sometimes play Bayati with<br/>the larger neutral second first - this vast variety in tuning practices, not<br/>just between regions but sometimes even between individual musicians, can really<br/>be a source for despair... I will stay with 17edo for now, but I am thinking of<br/>trying 53edo or 46edo one day. I prefer equal systems over non-equal<br/>well-temperaments since I like free transposability and modulation capability -<br/>and more ease for harmonization - with not too many notes (still enough,<br/>however...). As for 29edo, I think the Rast scale in it comes out with a third<br/>close to 5/4, so I would say it is suited for turkish Rast but less so for<br/>arabic Rast, correct?</p><p>Here is now my harmonization of the Bayati phrase by Najat Aatabou, in 17edo. It<br/>is not triadic but only two voices, and you will hear that I avoid the decision<br/>whether the base note of Bayati is to be harmonized as minor or major. As my<br/>previous examples, I consider it a success insofar as it sounds pleasing (well,<br/>to me, at least) but maybe rather a failure insofar as the original character<br/>rof the maqam tends to be altered substantially, if not destroyed. Possibly this<br/>is the fate of any tentative to introduce polyphony in maqam music - but let&apos;s<br/>see what the future holds!</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a1da0e9asgzvcjp/BayatiCounterpoint17edoTest2.mp3">https://www.dropbox.com/s/a1da0e9asgzvcjp/BayatiCounterpoint17edoTest2.mp3</a></p><p>--</p><p>Hans Straub</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;marcel@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>Thank you soo much for this wealth of information!<br/>Will keep this around for reference!</p><p>&gt;  Marcel, the Pythagorean comma or 53-EDO notation of 6-7-9 commas<br/>very nicely expresses this, and a Pythagorean tuning of<br/>137-157-204 cents would be fine for the kind of Egyptian Bayyati<br/>that Scott Marcus describes with the lower step at around 135-145<br/>cents, as well as for a Syrian school which simply defines the<br/>Bayyati tetrachord as 6-7-9 commas.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s the one I&apos;m going with for now.
