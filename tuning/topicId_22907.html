After I had<br/>&quot;discovered&quot; the first tuning by playing around with some generators<br/>in Scala, I wisely searched the Scala archives with &apos;grep&apos; for<br/>&apos;233.985&apos; (the generator in cents) and learned that he had documented<br/>_precisely_ the same tuning in a 31-note version.</p><p>This is a near-subset of the &quot;Miracle Scale,&quot; as I discuss below, and<br/>I hope that Manuel will get due recognition for this generator of<br/>3:2^1/3 in any discussion of such subsets (see temp31g3.scl, which may<br/>have also been mentioned in earlier lists of Scala files -- I&apos;m not<br/>sure).</p><p>The second scale took a different approach, also inspired by all the<br/>excitement here: start with the familiar, and make &quot;one basic change&quot;<br/>leading to some radically new experience. This is a science fiction<br/>genre used in the 1970&apos;s in a workshop with Ursula K. LeGuin, and also<br/>in some &quot;alternate history novels&quot; where one &quot;decisive event&quot; comes<br/>out differently, and history along with it.</p><p>Now I find myself in a kind of alternative music history -- not that<br/>this is a totally novel situation for me, only that yesterday it got a<br/>lot more &quot;alternative&quot; in a curiously 21st-century way.</p><p>Please forgive me if a preface my odyssey with a bit of an &quot;editorial&quot;<br/>on the topic of diversity -- something that&apos;s helpful to reaffirm upon<br/>the discovery of _any_ monumentally new tuning system or music.</p><p>To allude to a favorite quote of Paul Erlich from Max Meyer, &quot;_the<br/>invention of scales_&quot; can and should be a contagious experience.<br/>While speaking only for myself, I hope that I may articulate some<br/>important concerns and suggest, in part through my own experience of<br/>this last exciting week, how one awe-inspiring discovery can stimulate<br/>others.</p><p>                     -        -        -        -</p><p>This is more than the issue of a scale: it is in good part a question<br/>of what &quot;optimization&quot; means in a xenharmonic community with so many<br/>different musical and intonational ideals. As one might ask, &quot;Who<br/>will optimize the optimizers?&quot;</p><p>Is an &quot;optimized&quot; system the same thing for me, a follower of the<br/>medieval-Manneristic European tradition, as for Jon Szantos, a devoted<br/>musician in the tradition of Harry Partch; for Haresh Bakshi, a<br/>musician skilled in the practice and theory of the raga tradition of<br/>India, as for Judith Conrad, a harpsichordist and advocate of the<br/>tradition of Baroque Europe; for Paul Erlich, an exponent of small<br/>integer ratios as the basis of &quot;ideal&quot; temperaments, as for Jacky<br/>Ligon, often a lover of large integer ratios?</p><p>As a medievalist, I&apos;m unlikely to say that any new tuning makes<br/>Pythagorean &quot;obsolete,&quot; and I&apos;d strongly suspect that Jon would say<br/>the same about the 43-note system of Harry Partch. Please note that<br/>we&apos;re not promoting these scales as total solutions either, of course.</p><p>Emphasizing with great circumspection that I don&apos;t want to imply that<br/>people are promoting the &quot;Miracle Scale&quot; as a &quot;total solution&quot; either,<br/>only to focus on why it might best be cherished and promoted as an<br/>astounding breakthrough under one theoretical approach for certain<br/>styles, I&apos;d like to show how basic musical assumptions do differ<br/>here.</p><p>If we have different assumptions and &quot;rules&quot; for making music -- and<br/>thus for designing and &quot;optimizing&quot; tunings -- then we can make this a<br/>virtue, presenting to the &quot;non-xenharmonic&quot; world the thriving face of<br/>pluralism.</p><p>We can also present the &quot;Miracle Scale&quot; as _one_ example of what<br/>people are doing -- for example, Mary&apos;s beautiful pieces I&apos;ve heard<br/>about here -- along with Jon&apos;s Partchian or other JI adventures, the<br/>Monz&apos;s Aristoxenian 75:64 adventure, Paul&apos;s 22-tET decatonic music,<br/>Jacky&apos;s Rational Intonation (RI), maybe in something of the tradition<br/>of Kathleen Schlesinger, and so forth.</p><p>Dan Stearns has been focusing on the idea of &quot;nontraditional<br/>generators&quot; for a long time here, and I&apos;d see the &quot;Miracle Tuning&quot; as<br/>one variety of this kind of solution.</p><p>Any scale, it seems to me, can be miraculous in the right time, place,<br/>and stylistic context. If we attempt to take any one scale as<br/>&quot;optimal&quot; in a style-independent context, however, it seems to me we<br/>are in danger of reinventing the 12-tET hegemony. I&apos;m not saying that<br/>anyone is proposing to do this, only that when an &quot;ideal&quot; scale comes<br/>along, it&apos;s a good time to remember that there are _lots_ of such<br/>scales, as varied as the musical practices they support and foster.</p><p>For example, one effect this thread has had on me is to encourage me<br/>to find my own _mirabile dictu_ scales (translation: &quot;wonderful to<br/>speak of&quot;), sometimes a process of &quot;rediscovery.&quot;</p><p>Dan Stearns and I were discussing his formula for generators a few<br/>months ago, and what I recommend is that everyone with an interest in<br/>xenharmonics try at least one of these &quot;nontraditionally generated&quot;<br/>scales, whatever may fit one&apos;s own musical style or sense of<br/>mathematical elegance.</p><p>For me, this thread plus a pleasant revisit to Dave Keenan&apos;s<br/>&quot;chain-of-fifths&quot; regions (meantone, Pythagorean, 22-tET, Wolf fifths,<br/>etc.) led me to look around in Scala for generators equal to or near<br/>some precise fraction of a pure 3:2 fifth -- a Pythagorean touch, of<br/>course. Dan Stearn, as I recall, last year did a 3:2^1/10 or<br/>&quot;decififth&quot; scale somewhat like 17-tET, for which it took a while<br/>before I caught on &lt;grin&gt; -- and Gary Morrison&apos;s 88-CET is close to<br/>3:2^1/8.</p><p>Before telling the story rather briefly here, I&apos;d like to call<br/>attention to the role that Manuel op de Coul and Dave Finnamore will<br/>play in it -- when I learn that my &quot;discovery&quot; is a rediscovery, as<br/>well as a near subset of the &quot;Miracle Scale.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, coming from a neo-Gothic outlook on optimization, I explored a<br/>few areas in Scala like 683 cents and 718 cents -- intriguing from a<br/>&quot;chain-of-fifths&quot; perspective focusing on 7-tET to 5-tET, with the<br/>second generator near the 5-tET border and the first actually below the<br/>7-tET border -- and also 3:2^1/4 or something like that.</p><p>Then I found what seemed to be _my_ &quot;mirabile dictu&quot; tuning of this<br/>variety: 3:2^1/3, with a generator at ~233.985 cents (close enough!).</p><p>In Scala, I tried a 24-note version using this generator, and found<br/>that it would yield 21 pure trines (2:3:4), 18 pure &quot;quintal/quartal&quot;<br/>combinations like 6:8:9 or 9:12:16 (another Pythagorean favorite for<br/>neo-Gothic music), and 17 near-pure &quot;7-flavor&quot; quads or tetrads<br/>(12:14:18:21 or 14:21:24:28) and their subsets.</p><p>At the same time, I&apos;d also have lots of friendly and familiar<br/>Pythagorean &quot;3-flavor&quot; quads (54:64:81:96 or 64:81:96:108) -- in fact,<br/>as Scala showed, 12 of them.</p><p>More than that, this was a _conceptually_ fascinating scale because it<br/>crowded all these neat trines, triples, and quads in a compact<br/>&quot;geometry&quot; outside of usual Pythagorean conventions. At least on a<br/>12-note keyboard, I would find navigating it &quot;new and different,&quot; to<br/>say the least -- a challenge maybe a bit like classic multi-prime JI<br/>systems.</p><p>The most obvious thing _not_ covered in this scale was a neo-Gothic<br/>17-flavor (e.g. 14:17:21), but then I don&apos;t expect any one scale to<br/>cover everything. As it happened, a tempered version of 3:2^1/3 in<br/>36-tET (sound familiar?), or an Erlich-style least sum of squares<br/>optmization for 12:14:18:21 at ~233.53 cents, would provide a<br/>17-flavor -- although not in as many effortlessly accessible positions<br/>as a simple 24-out-of-36-tET with the keyboards 1/6-tone apart.</p><p>What intrigued me especially about the pure 3:2^1/3 tuning was that it<br/>might be called both &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;quasi-just_ at the same time. All the<br/>basic Pythagorean intervals were pure -- 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 9:8 -- and<br/>also the more complex thirds and sixths, etc.</p><p>By my usual definition, a &quot;Just&quot; tuning has all _stable_ consonances<br/>as pure integer ratios -- and 3:2^1/3 meets this test, although it<br/>doesn&apos;t meet my other usual test that &quot;all intervals are derived from<br/>integer ratios.&quot; Is it JI/RI? To borrow the title of Peter Abelard&apos;s<br/>famous and sometimes very controversial book, _Sic et non_ -- &quot;Yes,<br/>and no.&quot;</p><p>From a 7-flavor perspective, it&apos;s &quot;quasi-just,&quot; with the 7-based<br/>ratios of 12:14:18:21 all ~2.81 cents impure. Not only the fifth, but<br/>the Pythagorean limma or diatonic semitone (256:243, ~90.22 cents),<br/>gets divided into three equal parts -- and also the 1029:1024 schisma<br/>or the like, also known as a &quot;gamelan residue&quot; I would soon learn,<br/>defined as the difference between the 64:63 and 49:48 commas. The<br/>7-based intervals, as I would not be the first theorist to discover,<br/>are impure by 1/3 of this schisma or residue.</p><p>Having described &quot;my&quot; tuning -- some earlier discoverers are coming up<br/>soon, and in any event 3:2^1/3 isn&apos;t so surprising an idea when the<br/>leading topic on this list has been 3:2^1/6 -- maybe I should say a<br/>word about my implicit musical tastes and prejudices, some<br/>(neo-)Gothic, but some also likely characteristically 20th-century.</p><p>While I&apos;ve often described my use of sonorities like 6:8:9 or<br/>12:14:18:21 in a neo-Gothic setting, I might suggest that in loving<br/>these sonorities I am also a child of the era of Debussy and Bartok.<br/>They feature fifths, fourths, and major seconds or minor sevenths --<br/>but not the &quot;strong discords&quot; of either 13th-century or 20th-century<br/>theory: minor seconds, major sevenths, or tritones or diminished<br/>fifths.</p><p>In 20th-century terms, 6:8:9 and its kin are &quot;fourth chords&quot; or &quot;fifth<br/>chords,&quot; while as Dave Keenan has excellently explained, 12:14:18:21<br/>is a 7-based variant on the minor seventh chord, a &quot;subminor seventh<br/>chord&quot; to borrow his ideal nomenclature for this kind of context.<br/>Likewise, following suit, we might describe 14:18:21:24 as a<br/>&quot;supermajor added sixth chord,&quot; a 7-flavor version of a favorite<br/>closing sonority in some 20th-century genres.</p><p>Following either Jacobus of Liege in the early 14th century, or<br/>various authors of books on &quot;20th-century harmony&quot; and the like such<br/>as Ludmila Ulehla in her excellent _Contemporary Harmony_, I might<br/>describe these sonorities as &quot;pancompatible&quot; -- they are very rich,<br/>but include no strong or acute discords.</p><p>In an equitonal system such as Pythagorean tuning, meantone, 12-tET,<br/>or 22-tET, by the way, more complex &quot;pancompatible&quot; sonorities are<br/>possible -- pentads such as E-G-A-B-D (e.g. 0-5-9-13-18 in 22-tET),<br/>which one might describe as &quot;pentatonic clusters&quot; from a chain of four<br/>fifths, e.g. G-D-A-E-B. (&quot;Anhemitonic pentatonic pentads&quot; would be<br/>more precise, since there are also pentatonic scales with semitones<br/>and major thirds.)  This is as far as we can go without introducing a<br/>semitone or tritone.</p><p>Interestingly, if some of what I&apos;ve read is correct, Japanese gagaku<br/>music (very intriguing to my ears) uses complex clusters of this kind,<br/>with forms including semitones or tritones deemed tenser than those<br/>without, although at least one text cautions that the sense of<br/>&quot;concord/discord&quot; or the like is different from the cadential dynamic<br/>of much European music.</p><p>The only &quot;anomaly&quot; I associate with 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 is a<br/>curious complication of multi-prime JI: we cannot construct a<br/>pancompatible pentad from such a tetrad using pure fifths and fourths<br/>because in systems where three fourths do _not_ equal a minor third.<br/>Paul, you&apos;re written on this general point, and the 22-tET<br/>pancompatible pentad (in a &quot;Pythagorean&quot; arrangement) might serve as<br/>one example of your theme of &quot;the advantages of tempering.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 itself presents no problem in a<br/>pure or quasi-pure 7-flavor, so I was ready to tune, once I had<br/>figured out how to map this scale onto two 12-note Halberstadt<br/>keyboards (also known as MIDI controller keybaords).</p><p>Somewhere around here, while getting ready both to tune and to post<br/>here, I did a very wise thing -- using a UNIX-style &apos;grep&apos; utility<br/>to search the Scala archive for any scale with &apos;233.985&apos; in it. Lo and<br/>behold, I promptly discovered temp31g3.scl -- and learned that my<br/>precise 3:2^1/3 generator was a _re_discovery, not just the general<br/>idea, but the exact tuning (in 31 notes rather my 24).</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul, the author of this scale as well as the version<br/>of Scala I so happily use in MS-DOS 6.22, identified this scale as<br/>&quot;Cycle of 31 minor sevenths tempered by 1/3 gamelan residue.&quot;</p><p>Turning to intnam.par, I confirmed that this &quot;gamelan residue&quot; was<br/>1029:1024, the same as the 49:48-64:63 comma or schisma I had<br/>recognized was &quot;trisected&quot; by this tuning. I&apos;m not sure whether<br/>7-based intervals are involved in gamelan, or if maybe this is the<br/>interval by which an octave is typically stretched or the like -- and<br/>I&apos;d love to learn the answer.</p><p>How wonderful that the gamelan tradition, another beautiful world<br/>music, should somehow involve the same ratio I had encountered from a<br/>neo-Gothic perspective. This kind of connection seems to me one of the<br/>greatest miracles a scale can accomplish.</p><p>Roughly around that same time, I also read a post from David Finnamore<br/>explaining how 8:7^3 quite closely approximated 9:6 (n+1:m-1) or 3:2.<br/>In any discussion of the 3:2^1/3 scale, I would also want to give him<br/>credit and recognition for describing this pattern (of which I wasn&apos;t<br/>aware) and generalizing it to other ratios.</p><p>Anyway, I did tune it, and after talking with my Mom on Mother&apos;s Day<br/>and sharing the excitement, I played it -- with lots of adventure in<br/>navigating the not-so-symmetrically mapped keyboards. It was a new<br/>geometry, and that in itself gives the scale a special place.</p><p>Over those same few days of following the &quot;Miracle Tuning&quot; thread and<br/>(re-)discovering 3:2^1/3, another idea also occurred to me -- a much<br/>simpler approach to getting more 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 sonorities<br/>in a 24-note tuning, and getting them as pure JI.</p><p>It was so simple, why hadn&apos;t it occurred to me before: just tune two<br/>standard 12-note Pythagorean manuals at the distance of a 7:6. That<br/>gives a usual Eb-G# tuning on each manual, hardly an unusual approach<br/>for me &lt;grin&gt;, plus no fewer than 11 of these pure 7-flavor quads or<br/>tetrads.</p><p>Wherever there was a pure fifth on each keyboard -- everywhere except<br/>for the &quot;Wolf,&quot; Eb-G# -- I would have a 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24, in<br/>other words in 11 out of 12 locations.</p><p>One point that both Dave Keenan and Graham Breed had made in<br/>discussions of 7-based optimizations is that with a usual Pythagorean<br/>chain you need 14 fifths for a near-7:4. From my neo-Gothic<br/>perspective, you need 16 to get a full 12:14:18:21 (the number needed<br/>to generate a 9:7 major third, to me a &quot;7-based&quot; interval).</p><p>Tuning the two keyboards a septimal rather than Pythagorean comma<br/>apart makes the 7-flavor sonorities pure, and &quot;only&quot; 8 positions is<br/>enough for lots of music.</p><p>Now, however, I could get these sonorities in 11 positions, plus all<br/>the usual Pythagorean sonorities on either keyboard.</p><p>Was this optimization too good to be true? There didn&apos;t seem to be any<br/>obvious &quot;unintended side effect,&quot; other than a few new patterns for<br/>7-flavor sonorities and cadences to learn.</p><p>As I joked to myself, I had &quot;broken the Keenan barrier&quot; by happening<br/>upon a 24-note Pythagorean tuning with 11 pure 12:14:18:21 sonorities.<br/>A major point of Dave&apos;s &quot;chain-of-fifths&quot; papers is that the _length_<br/>of the tuning chain required for a given interval can be very relevant<br/>to the question of utility.</p><p><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/2ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/2ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm</a></p><p>The unspoken qualification and compromise here, of course, is that we<br/>no longer are dealing with a single chain of fifths, but with _two_<br/>such chains at the distance of a pure 7:6 -- in contrast to a distance<br/>defined by an even division of the octave.</p><p>This is no big problem for me, since an Eb-G# gamut is quite roomy for<br/>lots of Gothic and neo-Gothic music, as a corresponding meantone gamut<br/>is for much 16th-century music.</p><p>However Dave or Graham might very appropriately point out that we are<br/>in fact favoring JI at the expense of the transposibility which comes<br/>with a usual 24-note Pythagorean chain or something close to it such<br/>as the septimal comma spacing.</p><p>Maybe even more important (and easy to leave unspoken within this<br/>stylistic setting), this tuning represents for me what I might call<br/>&quot;2-3/9-7 JI/RI.&quot; In other words, there are three main types of<br/>intervals included, some but not all of which may be shared with<br/>related or not-so-related musics:</p><p>     (1) Basic Pythagorean intervals and combinations involving<br/>         prime factors of 2 and 3, including the factor of 9<br/>         (2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 9:8), e.g. 2:3:4 or 6:8:9:12;</p><p>     (2) More complex Pythagorean or 3-prime intervals and<br/>         combinations, especially usual diatonic ones such as<br/>         those involving regular thirds and sixths (e.g. 64:81:96<br/>         or 54:64:81);</p><p>     (3) Intervals and combinations involving factors of 7 together<br/>         with Pythagorean factors of 2 and 3 or 9, especially<br/>         12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24.</p><p>From my viewpoint, categories (1) and (2) are &quot;usual,&quot; or &quot;bread and<br/>butter&quot;; category (3) is &quot;xenharmonic,&quot; the &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;guest&quot;<br/>element from a medieval Pythagorean perspective.</p><p>For a typical &quot;JI&quot; advocate, however, (1) and (3) may be routine but<br/>the usual complex Pythagorean intervals of (2) something quite other<br/>than &quot;audibly just.&quot; Thus my use of &quot;JI/RI&quot; to describe the system as<br/>a whole: for me, &quot;ratios of 3&quot; means all of the usual diatonic<br/>Pythagorean intervals, including the rational but complex ones.</p><p>However, for such an advocate, an even more important _omission_ is<br/>very likely to stand out: where are ratios of 5?</p><p>Someone seeking these ratios may follow a very different optimization<br/>strategy than I might -- in often seeking instead, for example, other<br/>kinds of complex thirds with ratios at or near 14:17:21 (not a major<br/>strength for this tuning, although it does have a few neutralish<br/>thirds around 345 and 357 cents to liven things up a bit further).</p><p>When I tuned it up yesterday, I very quickly found that it did have<br/>another aspect that would give me a _radically_ new musical experience<br/>within a few minutes of setting hands to keyboards, something that I<br/>had noted at some level in theory, but utterly overwhelmed me when it<br/>became very tangible practice.</p><p>I had figured out the rules or patterns for usual 7-flavor cadences,<br/>and immediately confirmed that these patterns worked just as<br/>predicted.</p><p>Now, however, it was time for something else. With this tuning,<br/>playing two notes at a visual &quot;unison&quot; on the two keyboards produces<br/>an actual 7:6 minor third; playing a &quot;fifth&quot; with the higher note on<br/>the upper keyboard likewise produces a 7:4 minor seventh. An &quot;octave&quot;<br/>or &quot;fifth&quot; with the lower note on the upper keyboard produces a 12:7<br/>major sixth or 9:7 major third -- a 7:6 _smaller_ than the visual<br/>interval.</p><p>Here&apos;s a layout arbitrarily using the octave C-C as a reference point,<br/>with the ampersand symbol &quot;&amp;&quot; showing a note raised by a 7:6. My<br/>intent isn&apos;t to document the tuning at length, only to provide a<br/>possible map for understanding what was about to happen:</p><p>     381       561             879       1083  1263<br/>     C#&amp;       Eb&amp;             F#&amp;       G#&amp;    Bb&amp;<br/>C&amp;          D&amp;        E&amp;    F&amp;       G&amp;       A&amp;     B&amp;    C&amp;<br/>267        471       675    765     969      1173   1377  1467<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>     114       294             612       816    996<br/>      C#        Eb              F#        G#     Bb<br/>C           D         E     F        G        A       B    C<br/>0          204       408   498      702      906    1110  1200</p><p>Here I&apos;m not so much concerned with fine points of ratios and cents as<br/>with the logic of the hands.</p><p>Starting with a 2:3:4 trine, say D3-A3-D4 on the lower keyboard, I<br/>shifted my left hand to D&amp;3 on the upper manual, and played a series<br/>of what _visually_ looked like parallel trines: D&amp;3-A3-D4, E&amp;3-B3-E4,<br/>etc.</p><p>Actually, I was playing in parallel 7:9:12 sonorities! -- and at least<br/>in this timbre (Yamaha TX-802, voice A56 &quot;puff pipes&quot; on both manuals)<br/>it sounded absolutely beautiful and transporting. To conclude a<br/>phrase, I did a usual cadence to a trine, say E&amp;3-G3-C4 to D&amp;3-A3-D4<br/>for a landing on the final of Dorian. Maybe I might enrich that<br/>penultimate sonority in my usual manner to E&amp;3-G3-B&amp;3-C4 (14:18:21:24),<br/>a sound so rich and vibrant that it reminds me of the words _electra ut<br/>sol_ from the Canticle of Canticles, &quot;as bright as the sun,&quot; famously<br/>set for example by Josquin.</p><p>People familiar a bit with late medieval or very early Renaissance<br/>music may recognize this as a 7-flavor analogue of the 14th-century<br/>English _cantilena_ style or the early 15th-century _fauxbourdon_ it<br/>served to inspire on the Continent (e.g. Dufay or Binchois). We have<br/>three voices starting on a trine, moving through a phrase in parallel<br/>thirds, sixths, and upper fourths, and concluding it with a usual<br/>cadence expanding to a trine.</p><p>However, there&apos;s one radical difference apart from the 7-based ratios:<br/>the voices are moving in _identical_ parallels -- a string of 7:9:12<br/>sonorities with _major_ thirds and sixths, rather than the usual<br/>alternation of major and minor forms. It is somewhat like an organ<br/>mixture, and a very 21st-century one to my ears.</p><p>Then I tried parallel 12:14:18:21 sonorities in a similar fashion,<br/>e.g. starting at the fifth D3-A3, moving to D3-D&amp;3-A3-A&amp;3 and then<br/>E3-E&amp;3-B3-B&amp;3, F3-F&amp;3-C3-C&amp;3, etc., eventually cadencing with a<br/>progression of E3-E&amp;3-B3-B&amp;3 to D&amp;3-A&amp;3 (outer minor seventh<br/>contracting to fifth).</p><p>Note that fauxbourdon in parallel minor sevenths is _not_ a late<br/>medieval or early Renaissance practice, just my curious offshoot,<br/>again with _identical_ parallel intervals.</p><p>As I was playing a chantlike melody, I was stunned and encompassed by<br/>the sheer beauty of the sound, as if it distilled the sonorousness and<br/>sweetness of Debussy, Vaughan Williams, and some of the music of my<br/>own youth favoring minor seventh chords or the like. It was a<br/>fauxbourdon for the 21st century, summing up some of the musical<br/>moments of the previous century also.</p><p>Debussy especially occurred to me. I asked myself, why does so much of<br/>the 20th century seem to be a struggle either to &quot;fight tonality&quot; or<br/>to extend it? Why not just flow around it in what I might call a<br/>Debussyan manner, taking a melody and enriching it with sheer<br/>sonority?</p><p>In my new technique of chant harmonization or fauxbourdon, was I<br/>hearing something analogous to what Dufay and his listeners heard in<br/>the early 15th century -- a new and captivating texture? It seemed so<br/>&quot;modern,&quot; so fitting in the year 2001 -- as Dufay&apos;s music can also<br/>sound to me at the right moments.</p><p>The old and the new are all there: regular Pythagorean keyboards for<br/>lots of intricate discant and contrapuntal weaving, plus amplified<br/>7-flavor cadences, plus this radically new kind of parallelism in<br/>which the 7-flavor sonorities seem like &quot;supersaturated concords,&quot; at<br/>once independent moments of incredibly rich sweetness in themselves<br/>and still very agreeably progressing to the usual trines.</p><p>(Prudence and due humility bid me add that if this &quot;new&quot; tuning and<br/>kind of 7-flavor parallelism have been discovered before, something<br/>not unlikely given the popularity of various kinds of parallelism from<br/>Impressionism to today, it will make my own experience no less<br/>exciting and transporting, but maybe even more meaningful in<br/>initiating me into some community of travellers who have come to know<br/>this inviting region.)</p><p>For me, this is indeed a &quot;wonder tuning&quot; -- but very happily, it<br/>doesn&apos;t make any of the others obsolete.</p><p>If we can keep the same perspective on the &quot;Miracle Tuning&quot; and other<br/>tunings discussed here, enthusiasm and pluralism may reinforce one<br/>another both on this List and in the larger arena of world musics.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=22949 href="#22949">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2001 10:56:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Here&apos;s my version, with<br/>more elegant renditions warmly invited:</p><p>   Gb@ - Db@ - Ab@ - Eb@ - Bb@ - F@ - C@ - G@ - D@ - A@ -  E@ -  B@<br/>  /     /     /     /     /     /    /    /    /    /     /     /<br/> /     /     /     /     /     /    /    /    /    /     /     /<br/>Eb - Bb - - F - - C - - G - - D -  A -  E -  B  - F# - C#  - G#</p><p>Each quadrilateral in this diagram represents a complete quad, with<br/>the 12:14:18:21 version starting from the lower left note<br/>(e.g. Eb-Gb@-Bb-Db@), and the 14:18:21:24 version starting from the<br/>upper left note (e.g. Gb@-Bb-Db@-Eb).</p><p>In fact, it had occurred to me that in this tuning the two keyboards<br/>themselves form a kind of visual lattice, with each manual as a<br/>horizontal 3-axis (11 pure fifths), and the vertical 7-axis between<br/>the two keyboards a pure 7:6 apart.</p><p>The fit between the conceptual and visual lattices can be shown by<br/>including the &quot;Sesquisexta-style&quot; keyboard notation where an ampersand<br/>or &quot;&amp;&quot; sign shows a note on the upper keyboard raised by a 7:6, as<br/>well as the equivalent &quot;@&quot; notation (or &quot;&lt;&quot; in the 72-EDO system):</p><p>   Eb&amp;   Bb&amp;   C&amp;    G&amp;    G&amp;    D&amp;   A&amp;   E&amp;   B&amp;   F#&amp;   C#&amp;   G#&amp;<br/>   Gb@ - Db@ - Ab@ - Eb@ - Bb@ - F@ - C@ - G@ - D@ - A@ -  E@ -  B@<br/>  /     /     /     /     /     /    /    /    /    /     /     /<br/> /     /     /     /     /     /    /    /    /    /     /     /<br/>Eb - Bb - - F - - C - - G - - D -  A -  E -  B  - F# - C#  - G#</p><p>By the way, for people interested in the musical significance of these<br/>quads in a neo-Gothic setting, my &quot;Gentle Introduction to neo-Gothic<br/>progressions&quot; might provide some context for this lattice-mapping<br/>approach:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038">/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038</a>  (1/Pt 1)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630">/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630</a>  (1/Pt 2A)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685">/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685</a>  (1/Pt 2B)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134">/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134</a>  (1/Pt 2C)</p><p>Here it may be worth emphasizing that the neo-Gothic 7-flavor quad<br/>reflects a different kind of intonational logic than the &quot;7-limit&quot; or<br/>&quot;n-limit&quot; concept often discussed here: it doesn&apos;t include any ratios<br/>of 5, and does include 9:7, regarded as &quot;9-limit&quot; by many people<br/>taking the n-limit approach.</p><p>Thank you for your very interesting comments and lattice showing the<br/>approximations of 5. Maybe I should take some of my mathematical<br/>musings in response to this and make them a separate reply, to keep<br/>the length of this one manageable, especially in view of your Miracle<br/>and related activities.</p><p>For now, I might mainly remark that your discussion of Pythagorean<br/>approximations of 7:6 at once brings back lots of history we&apos;ve shared<br/>in on this List, and calls a new possibility to my attention which I<br/>hadn&apos;t considered, although it makes beautiful sense the moment I look<br/>at it:</p><p>&gt; 3^-15 = ~270.674987 cents = ~3.804081415 cents wider than 7:6<br/>&gt; 3^-68 = ~267.0599412 cents = ~0.18903555 cent wider than 7:6</p><p>The first approximation is an important part of my &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot;<br/>tuning first posted here in 1998, with two 12-note Pythagorean manuals<br/>at a Pythagorean comma apart, forming a chain of 23 pure fifths. As<br/>you note, 7-prime intervals in this regular 24-note Pythagorean tuning<br/>are impure by about 3.80 cents, the 3-7 schisma.</p><p>We&apos;ve had some very interesting discussions about this kind of 7-based<br/>approximation as a &quot;Xenharmonic bridge,&quot; with a great entry on your<br/>Web site chronicling some of this dialogue.</p><p>Then, late last year, I proposed a &quot;modified Xeno-Gothic 3/7 JI&quot;<br/>tuning where the two keyboards are a _septimal comma_ apart, making<br/>the 7-flavor intervals and quads pure; the first post of this series<br/>gives a little background on Xeno-Gothic and the role of John Chalmers<br/>in inspiring the original version:</p><p>  <a href="/tuning/topicId_16640.html#16640">/tuning/topicId_16640.html#16640</a> (Part I)<br/>  <a href="/tuning/topicId_17034.html#17034">/tuning/topicId_17034.html#17034</a> (Part II)<br/>  <a href="/tuning/topicId_17339.html#17339">/tuning/topicId_17339.html#17339</a> (Part III)<br/>  <a href="/tuning/topicId_17389.html#17389">/tuning/topicId_17389.html#17389</a> (Part IV)<br/>  <a href="/tuning/topicId_17672.html#17672">/tuning/topicId_17672.html#17672</a> (Part V)</p><p>While approximating a 7:6 almost perfectly by 68 fourths up hadn&apos;t<br/>occurred to me, it makes perfect sense, because this interval is<br/>impure only by the difference between the 3-7 schisma and the comma of<br/>Mercator (or Kirchner?) by which 53 pure fifths exceed 31 pure<br/>octaves, or about (3.80 - 3.62) or 0.18 cents -- actually closer to<br/>0.19 cents with more accurate rounding, as you show.</p><p>Although I had described this very small interval in Part V of my &quot;3/7<br/>JI&quot; series and proposed the name &quot;nanisma,&quot; I didn&apos;t realize what a<br/>neat application it could have: a virtually pure 7:6 using only pure<br/>fifths as generators!</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
