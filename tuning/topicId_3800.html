I am pretty sure I was doinge verything correctly<br/>-unless Manuel can tell me what I was doing wrong= as Creative has been<br/>wrong about their products before. I admit I was a little peeved that i<br/>had a nice New soundcard that was preventing me from microtuning my<br/>Tx81zS. so i resorted to the old tried and true Cakewalk--D burgess was<br/>suggesting windows media player but that does not allow a tempo change<br/>it merely plays the file-again I am pretty sure you cannot change the<br/>tempo on the WMP nevertheless I took the resultant 17 limit Just scale<br/>and dropped it into Cakewalk and brought the tempo way down to like 20<br/>bpm at half speed and the babies took the Dump so to speak. Just thought<br/>I would post this out there for any one else trying to use Scala with<br/>the newer Sb cards. I am not sure but they use this Sb16 emulation for<br/>DOS games etc  where I guess most folks want the bitchin 3d audio as<br/>they slay demons and what not, but it seems to prevent sending messages<br/>out thru the port while in Dos.</p><p>Thanks to Darren Burgess of SEJIS for his continuing support and overall<br/>good vibes.</p><p>ciao<br/>Shree Swifty</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xxx</h3><span>6/28/1999 5:27:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; well according to Creative (makers of Sblive) the Sb card does not<br/>&gt; support DOS midi OUT .

To remedy this you can indeed use another<br/>MIDI file player, one that runs under Windows. It needn&apos;t be the<br/>Microsoft one. If you do an Altavista search on &quot;midi player&quot; you&apos;ll<br/>see several. The nice option of gsplay to slow it down which you<br/>need for the TX81Z to prevent an overrun may be harder to find in the<br/>players nowadays. The TX81Z is also pretty old.<br/>It&apos;s no problem to call another player from Scala. The SEND command<br/>looks for the script file send.cmd and executes it. You can manually<br/>edit it and substitute gsplay with another player in the SPAWN<br/>command you see there. It&apos;s best to write the full path name and don&apos;t<br/>forget the quotes if there&apos;s a directory with spaces in the name.<br/>How and if the player accepts the input file name (xxx.mid) from the<br/>command line varies from program to program. If it&apos;s not in help file<br/>somewhere it remains a matter of experimentation.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
