If we want to measure this type of complexity, let&apos;s<br/>just use a limit concept, or the (arithmatic or geometric) mean of n and d.</p><p>My problem with weighted lattice metrics is that the weighting destroys the<br/>information which I feel is most useful.  If such and such interval is<br/>binary at the 7-limit but trinary at the 5-limit in 34tET, that tells me<br/>something.  But adding some value for each rung, you don&apos;t know what&apos;s<br/>going on.</p><p>&gt;Inasmuch as all the different lattices and tonal systems<br/>&gt;we have been considering with this topic are based on<br/>&gt;an implicit assumption of a 1/1, they are all Monophonic<br/>&gt;(in the Partchian sense), and therefore *ALL* ratios<br/>&gt;are in one sense theoretically one rung away from 1/1.</p><p>Has Paul Erlich got a lattice metric for you!</p></div>
