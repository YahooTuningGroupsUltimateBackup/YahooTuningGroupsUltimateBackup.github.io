And the best<br/>we can do, as part of that theory, is to study the music itself<br/>closely and try out different possibilities, to hear what&apos;s plausible<br/>within the techniques and practices of his time/place.</p><p>I, for one, don&apos;t expect that Bach pinned himself to any *published*<br/>schemes by anybody.  Harpsichord tuning by ear is an art of listening,<br/>and dealing with each individual instrument&apos;s range of quirks.  Bach<br/>had already been doing it, hands on, for many years (and probably half<br/>his lifetime or more) before the 1720s (WTC 1: 1722).</p><p>Some of his earliest pieces, with the circulating accidentals in them,<br/>argue circumstantially that he already had something smooth -- and<br/>allowing modulation to anywhere -- before he was 25 years old.  A good<br/>example among many is the F# minor Toccata from c1710, +/-3 years,<br/>when Bach was in his mid-20s.  The way it uses E#, B#, Fx, and other<br/>exotic notes -- plus its long sequence of spiral-of-5ths modulation in<br/>a middle section -- suggests that Bach had a good way of handling all<br/>those enharmonic difficulties.  The B-flat Capriccio is another fine<br/>example, going adventurously into the flat side.</p><p>Bach wasn&apos;t a theoretician; he was a practicing musician and a very<br/>busy man both professionally and personally.  He taught through<br/>example, through hands-on work.  He was efficient: tuning a whole<br/>harpsichord in 15 minutes or less, as his usual practice.  And I have<br/>to take it as axiomatic that he tuned in such a way (on any given<br/>occasion) that the music to be played would sound good and proper, to<br/>him.  It also had to work in some way that he could play with other<br/>instrumentalists and singers.</p><p>Did he tune in different ways per composition (adjusting temperaments<br/>to match various key requirements per day), or did he have some<br/>fine-sounding &quot;one size fits all -- set it and forget it&quot; scheme of<br/>his own in his 15-minute tuning sessions?  We don&apos;t know for sure.<br/>The extant music suggests, to me, that the latter is more likely than<br/>the former.  Straightforward two-page compositions, such as many of<br/>the Inventions, so often use A#/Bb, D#/Eb, G#/Ab, etc pairs in the<br/>same piece: it argues (to me, anyway) that adjust-as-you-go-per-piece<br/>schemes would have been too fussy...especially on fretted clavichords,<br/>where the temperament *can&apos;t* be adjusted in that way without bending<br/>the tangents left or right.  The notes E#/F, B#/C, Fx/G also have to<br/>work, in some way, without any speculative split-key arguments.</p><p>So anyway, these are some of the bricks on which my theory is based.<br/>I&apos;ll never know for sure how Bach tuned.  I&apos;ve never said I did.<br/>Those who focus on the graphology (how should we read Bach&apos;s drawing,<br/>if at all, in any meaningful way?) are missing at least 95% of the<br/>point.  The music comes first.  Any candidate temperaments have to be<br/>easy to do in just a few minutes, entirely by ear, and they have to<br/>fit all the available musical and historical evidence.</p><p>Brad Lehman  (the pancake breakfast was yummy)</p></div><h3><a id=76346 href="#76346">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>5/17/2008 7:37:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brad:  I agree.

I have it open right here in front of me.  Page 70 is about<br/>Reincken&apos;s fugues and the &quot;permutation technique&quot; structure in them.<br/>There is not a thing about tuning on that page, or any nearby page.</p><p>This Wolff book *does* have two indexed references to Werckmeister,<br/>namely on pages 43 and 46.  Page 43 is about Walther&apos;s friendship with<br/>Werckmeister and his acquisition of Buxtehude manuscripts from him.<br/>Not about any Bach connection, not even a speculative one, with<br/>Werckmeister.  And page 46 is about Buxtehude&apos;s (not Bach&apos;s) expertise<br/>in organ technology, with two sentences connecting Buxtehude and<br/>Werckmeister.  Wolff even reproduces the speculation from Kerala<br/>Snyder&apos;s book (about Buxtehude) that Buxtehude was &quot;the most prominent<br/>advocate of Werckmeister&apos;s new systems of temperament....&quot;  But again,<br/>there&apos;s no Bach connection drawn there explicitly by Wolff.  If Wolff<br/>has any expectation that Bach picked up any of this tuning stuff in<br/>his couple of weeks visiting Buxtehude, he certainly doesn&apos;t say so<br/>here.  Wolff&apos;s discussion is about compositional matters, not<br/>technical issues of tuning.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t do to cite Wolff on things he didn&apos;t say!</p><p>Let&apos;s track this down.</p><p>You apparently meant to say it&apos;s from page 70 of a different Wolff<br/>book: _The Learned Musician_.  Wolff wrote there:<br/>&quot;Most important, he [Bach] had acquired a solid scientific foundation<br/>in the art of organ building by studying Andreas Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>manual, _Erweiterte und verbesserte Orgelprobe_ (Quedlinburg, 1698).<br/>[58] The earliest extant evidence of Bach&apos;s organ expertise, his<br/>Muhlhausen organ renovation proposal of 1708, [59] demonstrates that<br/>in his principles, methods, and terminology he relied heavily on<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s influential treatise. [60]</p><p>Let&apos;s track *those* down, through those three endnotes in Wolff&apos;s text.</p><p>[58] says Wolff is referring to the &quot;expanded version&quot; of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s 1681 book.  N.B., it&apos;s NOT a reference to the 1691 book<br/>that has the temperaments in it.  It&apos;s the 1681/1698 book.</p><p>[59] refers to item #31 in the _New Bach Reader_, edited by Wolff<br/>himself, which I have right here: it&apos;s a page where young Bach listed<br/>parts of the organ specification with remarks about how all those<br/>items need to be redone, better.  There&apos;s not a thing about any<br/>selection of temperament; Bach merely wrote: &quot;And finally, in addition<br/>to a complete tuning of the whole organ, the tremulant must be<br/>regulated so that it flutters at the proper rate.&quot;  Wolff as editor,<br/>here, makes no explicit connection about any resemblance here to the<br/>1681/1698 Werckmeister book, as if Bach cribbed anything from it, or<br/>even an outline from it.  At any rate, it&apos;s not the 1691 book anyway;<br/>so, the connection here is moot on any expectation (by Johnny<br/>Reinhard, not by Christoph Wolff!) that Bach picked up one specific<br/>Werckmeister temperament from any of this.</p><p>[60] is a reference out to an article by Peter Williams in the 1982<br/>_Bach-Jahrbuch_.  Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have that article at hand<br/>myself...but I do hope that Johnny has dutifully read all of it, to<br/>see *exactly* what Williams said there in any presumed<br/>Werckmeister/Bach connection.  Still, it&apos;s about the 1681/1698 book,<br/>not the 1691.</p><p>I do have Williams&apos;s 2003 second edition of _The Organ Music of Bach_,<br/>and in there (page 227-228) Williams asserts with no reference:<br/>&quot;&apos;Anfahend&apos;, an old-fashioned term (...) feature[s] in the dedication<br/>of Werckmeister&apos;s book about a famous rebuilt organ, _Organum<br/>gruningense redivivum_ (Quedlinburg, 1705), a description surely known<br/>to Bach.&quot;  &quot;Surely known to Bach&quot;...how does Williams &quot;know&quot; this, and<br/>why hasn&apos;t he presented evidence?  And how would the 1705 book have<br/>any connection with Werckmeister&apos;s 1691 ideas about temperament?<br/>(Williams doesn&apos;t assert here that it does; neither does Wolff.)  What<br/>about other ways in which Bach could have learned the word &apos;Anfahend&apos;<br/>with respect to organs, for what that&apos;s worth?  Did he *have to* get<br/>it only from a Werckmeister book?  (Williams, in fact, cites its use<br/>in an Ammerbach book from 1571, for which there *is* documentation in<br/>_Bach-Dokumente_ p.269 that Bach knew it.  Bach&apos;s connection with the<br/>Ammerbach book is documented in an extant source; but, his connection<br/>with the 1705 Werckmeister book is only Williams&apos;s asserted speculation.)</p><p>Let&apos;s sum up.</p><p>Wolff says nothing here, in any of the three books I have open here<br/>(_Essays_, _Learned Musician_, and _New Bach Reader_) about any<br/>connection, speculative or otherwise, about any Bach connection with<br/>any Werckmeister temperament.

Wolff&apos;s closest<br/>discussion of Werckmeister + Bach is on pages 228-229 of _The Learned<br/>Musician_ (which see).  Wolff references Bach&apos;s borrowing of the term<br/>&quot;wohl temperirt&quot;, which happened to have been used by Werckmeister<br/>[and could have been used by anyone else discussing circulating<br/>temperaments of any kind...].  Wolff also points out that<br/>Werckmeister, among other scholars of the time, had a &quot;spirit of<br/>discovery&quot; that allowed musicians to play in all 24 keys at all, &quot;to<br/>expand and systematize the conventional tonal system&quot;...and that it<br/>fell to Bach to provide the first good practical example doing so.</p><p>Again, nothing tying Bach to any single selected temperament of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s.</p><p>Carry on.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=76357 href="#76357">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>5/17/2008 9:07:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ease up, Brad.  Just coming out of concerts, only to pack the  schedule<br/>teaching and playing for rent.  I can&apos;t get into detail.   This summer is the<br/>necessary time to clean things up.   Guess it makes  sense for you to go on the<br/>offensive. ;)</p><p>Brad:  Again, nothing tying Bach to any single selected temperament of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s.</p><p>Johnny: Firstly, and this has to be general memory, Werckmeister was a<br/>famous personage.  Any organist worth his salt had Orgel-Probe.   That&apos;s why it was<br/>so easy for Wolff, Schweitzer, and many other  historians</p><p>On  page 597 of Walther&rsquo;s Lexicon,  under the word &ldquo;temperament,&rdquo; one finds<br/>this quote from Andreas Werckmeister&rsquo;s Musicalische  Temperatur (1691),  word<br/>for word:<br/>Temperamento (ital.)  temperament (gall.)  Temperatur, is in der<br/>musicalischen  Stimmung, ein kleiner Abschnitt von der Vollkommenheit der musicalischen<br/>Proportionen, wodurch die Zusammenbindung der progressen fuglich geschiehet,<br/>und  das Gehor vergnuget wird.  s.  Werckmeisters Musicalische Temperatur, p. 3.<br/>With all of Werckmeister&apos;s renown -- Buxtehude, Schnittger, a veritiable<br/>neighbor of the Bach&apos;s...walking distance, it is to Werckmeister&apos;s famous tuning<br/>that W. was most recognized, at least among others.</p><p>I will present circumstantial evidence that will bring the liklihood that<br/>Bach was acquainted with Werckmeister in many respects in his formative  years.<br/>Also, I will examine Walther&apos;s special relationship with Bach (as  close a<br/>cousin as his wife).  He was tuning through Werckmeister if you  look all the<br/>mentions.  And Walther was a proud student of  Werckmeister...yes the met and<br/>Walther remained attached to Werckmeister until  W.&apos;s death.</p><p>When the full picture is presented it will seem impossible for Bach not to<br/>know all about Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic well temperament.  If you want more<br/>anal retentive specificity, it will have to wait until sometime this  summer.<br/>But I appreciate your attention to the importance with which I  treat this<br/>matter.</p><p>On another note, you mentioned what connection there is between Mozart and<br/>Werckmeister: were you not aware of Leopold Mozart&apos;s Violin tutor that<br/>specifically mentions Werckmeister?  A more thorough examination of the  tunings<br/>leads to WIII as the most representative W. tuning.  Clearly, Paul  P. and I<br/>disagree about W1698.  I think if for the younger generalist in  music, precisely<br/>because of its in exactitude, Paul sees it as an evolution for  W.&apos;s aesthetic.<br/> Yes, Paul?</p><p>For now it is enough that if Bach had the second Orgel Probe, he would  still<br/>be fully knowledgeable of the tunings of the first version.  He might  not<br/>need that book on his shelf.  But scholars (such as Stinson) see clear<br/>connections between Bach&apos;s organ understanding and W&apos;s writings.</p><p>My position is most rationale: WIII was in the air just as JS Bach was on<br/>the horizon.  It was all in the timing.  And Wender was historically  described<br/>as a follower of Werckmeister.</p><p>Sorry if this doesn&apos;t satisfy you.  It works for me, but I have more<br/>material to present.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>**************Wondering what&apos;s for Dinner Tonight?

For an organist,  one temp<br/>is paramount due to its relative permanence.  WIII serves as a  better model<br/>than current ET.
