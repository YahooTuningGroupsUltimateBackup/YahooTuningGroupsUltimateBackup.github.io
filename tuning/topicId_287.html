That would be essentially painless.  It woudl be open to abuse<br/>of course, but one could, for extra effort, check the ftp logs that<br/>the transfer was from a known place.</p><p>I even suppose I could write such code with a little time.<br/>==John ffitch<br/>------- End of forwarded message -------</p></div>
