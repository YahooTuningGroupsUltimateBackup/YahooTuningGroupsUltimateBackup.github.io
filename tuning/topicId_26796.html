I majored in violin, but grew up in bands playing trumpet<br/>and French horn. Any wind player with a good ear can play with ANY<br/>intonation and sound good if his ear is sensitive enough. You can<br/>bend the tone almost a full semitone on most wind instruments, and<br/>the amount of bending for most alternative tunings is way inside<br/>that ballpark! A sax is one of the most flexible of the winds in this<br/>regard, which in addition to its &quot;boss&quot; timbre makes it so great for<br/>jazz!</p><p>There are some people who&apos;ll try to argue that they play certain<br/>notes out of tune because the instrumental design is necessarily<br/>compromised by the physical constraints of its operation. For<br/>example, the low D and C# on a trumpet have a physical resonance<br/>center that is sharp to equal temperament, the &quot;ideal&quot; to which these<br/>modern instrumental designs are tuned. So we have a compromise on the<br/>compromise! Sounds pretty gruesome!</p><p>However, even WITHOUT the slide levers that exist on the better<br/>designs to allow manual lengthening of the valve tubing, a good<br/>trumpeter will spontaneously adjust his embouchure to compensate.<br/>Some will argue that the latter approach compromises excessively the<br/>beauty of the timbre by going off resonance too far!</p><p>First, it&apos;s not that far in terms of the Q factor or sharpness of the<br/>resonance. Further, if the note is long enough to justify it, they<br/>can eliminate this problem with their thumb on the slide lever! If<br/>not, I feel strongly that the pitch accuracy far outweighs the value<br/>of any alleged improvement in timbre on a short note.</p><p>My take from historical experience with these specious arguments is<br/>that the true overriding concern behind them is a need to excuse a<br/>very poor ear!</p><p>- Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Seth Austen &lt;klezmusic@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; on 8/9/01 11:10 AM, tuning@y... at tuning@y... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Two tunings at once<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I jammed with a sax player a few years ago; I played 19 tone<br/>guitar,<br/>&gt; &gt; he played 12 tone sax...sounded great.

I suspect that this is probably to be found in the archives, but I don&apos;t know what search-terms to use.  Here is the question:</p><p>Most if not all of the discussions that I have read on the issue of keyboard temperaments have been framed in the &quot;vertical&quot; context, the assumption being that an approximation to pure intervals for some subset of key signatures is the goal.  Recently, I have been wondering whether consonance between a keyboard playing chordal accompaniment to a horizontal JI or modal melody could also have been a motivation in some cases?  And even more interesting, whether a keyboard temp would have been &quot;tweaked&quot; to accommodate a mixture of vertical and horizontal contexts on the keyboard itself.  I seem to hear some potential for this in early JSB, for example the Tocattas.</p><p>JB</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>8/13/2001 5:30:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Try &quot;polymicrotonal.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>James &#x3C;jmkh@uswest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 10:05:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 08:30 PM 8/13/01 -0400, Johnny wrote:</p><p>&gt;Try &quot;polymicrotonal.&quot;</p><p>Well, I checked that out, and although interesting, does not address historical practice, which is what I am curious about.  So if I were to rephrase my question, I would ask &quot;Did the old guys ever temper keyboards in a polymicrotonal context,  or does that even make sense with only 12 notes?&quot; Typically I gather, keyboard chordal accompaniments to microtonal melodies tend to stick to the notes that exist in common.  It would seem that in some case, there would be some left over.  That would appear to allow some latitude.  Also, latitude exists in the details of how the tunings of the notes that are normally used in the accompaniment are tempered. Another question is whether temperaments were ever set melodically?  It  is purported that Handel did it that way, and in fact it may have been common.  I don&apos;t see this sort of thing discussed in the usual sources regarding keyboard temps.   So there are several question intertwined, involving practical techniques of setting a temp (Was it always done harmonically?), the theoretical aspects (Was the goal of keyboard tempering always defined in a vertical context?) and musical (Were keyboard temperaments ever set up for a melodic context rather than harmonic?).</p><p>JB</p><p>JB</p></div>
