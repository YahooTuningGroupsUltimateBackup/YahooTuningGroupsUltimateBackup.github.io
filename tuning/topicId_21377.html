Could have vibrato with whatever components<br/>of tremulo or modulation one wished.</p><p>Also slow crescendos from p to f, or diminuendos, both on a<br/>single note with fixed pitch - lovely on a sustained note in a tune.</p><p>Has anyone come across this turbulence technique at all.</p><p>It definitely works, and I find it hard to believe I<br/>could be the first to discover it!</p><p>However, amateur AND professional recorder playing that I&apos;ve heard has<br/>a smaller dynamic range than one would expect if this<br/>technique was generally used (unless used intuitively, when one has<br/>smaller dynamic range because one doesn&apos;t know what can be done).</p><p>Also I haven&apos;t seen it described anywhere. I think possibly<br/>it could be learnt fairly early on by amateurs<br/>as it isn&apos;t really that hard to do once you get<br/>the knack of it; one would just need to be shown it, and<br/>given a few hints, I think. Though, I may well have been doing<br/>it for some time without knowing, so it may be harder than it seems.</p><p>Range is f to p for the low register G on recorder.</p><p>It&apos;s just so lovely for varying dynamics, echo effects,<br/>varying sustained notes, etc. Also will be great once<br/>one can independently vary pitch or volume for the<br/>vibrato.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been practicing multiphonics on the recorder -<br/>by playing between the break between two fingerings.</p><p>Some of them give triads with one of the notes<br/>BELOW the recorder&apos;s pitch range.</p><p>I think perhaps they may be difference tones?</p><p>Easy one to play, but not so easy to hear<br/>- if you play a G4 in the low register<br/>at max volume, just before the break to the<br/>higher register, you get a high G5 of course,<br/>but rather quiet, a fairly quiet but easily<br/>noticeable B5b (once one knows to look out for it),<br/>E6b (the loudest partial at this point), a trace<br/>of C6, AND a low G3 (fairly quiet).</p><p>No special techniques needed, just play a loud G4<br/>with a steady breath, to just before the break,<br/>and listen carefully for a quiet low G3.<br/>It&apos;s very quiet: ppp, if the note is ff, though<br/>one can make it a bit louder if you hit it exactly<br/>right - maybe pp with some care :-).</p><p>However, they can be loud:</p><p>0 1 2 - 4 5</p><p>= A3b + A4b + B5.</p><p>You have to get the other two in tune to hear the A3b,<br/>and when you do, it is as loud as the other two.</p><p>It takes a while to find this one - the B5 comes<br/>in easily, but the breath pressure<br/>has to be nearly exactly right before the A3b<br/>sounds, and then some more adjustment is needed before it<br/>gets really loud. Sometimes I find it faster than at other times.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure it is a difference tone - the B5 is<br/>slow sounding, and when it comes in at the start of<br/>the chord after the A4b, the A3b sounds with it, immediately.</p><p>Also, the pitches are right for the 5th and 6th harmonics<br/>with fundamental as the difference tone.</p><p>This is also an alternative fingering of F6# on the descant,<br/>but I can&apos;t hear any trace of F6# in the chord.<br/>One needs tolerant neighbours when practicing these.</p><p>With the turbulence technique, one can easily keep a steady<br/>pitch for the A4b, while adding in the other two notes<br/>to make the triad.</p><p>I&apos;m doing a little tune for solo recorder + multiphonics<br/>and difference tones.<br/>However, needs tolerant neighbours to practice it!<br/>May be nice when completely finished.</p><p>The notes are perhaps a bit harsh, but the in-tuneness<br/>will help when finished, and maybe I&apos;ll find a way<br/>to soften them a bit. When you are finding your way<br/>to them, just sounds like a recorder being played<br/>incredibly badly!</p><p>Other multiphonics with difference tones that I&apos;ve<br/>found, and may use in the piece:<br/>0 1 - 3 4<br/>0 1 - 3 4 - 6<br/> 0 1 - 3 4 - - 7<br/>0 1 - 3 4 - 6 7<br/>0 1 - 3 4 5 - 7<br/>0 1 2 - 4 - - 7<br/>0 1 2 - 4 - 6<br/>0 1 2 - 4 5 &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>0 1 2 3 4 5 - 7<br/>all of which have loud difference tones below the range of<br/>the recorder (at least seems fairly likely that&apos;s what<br/>they are).</p><p>Ones with similar fingerings have widely varying<br/>difference tones, though the same basic note.<br/>So one could play a little tune on the difference<br/>tones and high partials against a drone of the other note.</p><p>Anyone got any other multiphonics for the recorder<br/>that I can try? (With or without difference tones).</p><p>Also, anyone want to hear this multiphonic going below recorder<br/>range, or the varying of volume while keeping pitch steady?<br/>I&apos;ve got a microphone somewhere... I&apos;ll record a demo if it<br/>really is a new thing and anyone wants to hear it.</p><p>:-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=21386 href="#21386">ðŸ”—</a>David J.
