There has been a lot of discussion of them<br/>since, but has anyone listened to them, actually played anything<br/>using them?! That for me is the bottom line. I haven&apos;t seen any<br/>reference in anyone&apos;s posts responding to these temperaments that<br/>anyone on this list has done that. &lt;&lt;</p><p>Greetings,<br/>   Yes, Bob, I did.  I have tried it(your Wendell natural) twice, on my 1893<br/>Steinway A.  I did it once with a normal amount of stretch, and then again<br/>with the double octaves beating about 1/2 beat per second,( what I consider a<br/>boatload of stretch).  I have waited until I had several pianists play the<br/>tunings and give me their impressions. Being a tuner,not a musician, I don&apos;t<br/>know that my personal observations are of much use, (though I will, of<br/>course, sling them in there anyway)<br/>   The first player is a long time professional, has arrangements on more<br/>than a few multi-million selling recordings, now plays on the road with a<br/>&quot;country artist&quot;,( I use that term liberally, around here).  He is well<br/>versed in jazz, not in classical music. He is accustomed to playing a variety<br/>of well-temperaments that I use around town, as well as his own Steinway at<br/>home in a Broadwood&apos;s tuning.  He played the normal stretch.<br/>   His impression was that the piano was almost in equal temperament.  He<br/>wondered if I had simply let an ET get &quot;sorta loose&quot;.  Upon a more careful<br/>investigation, he did notice the harmonic progression, but commented on how<br/>subtle it was, though he did notice that the keys most remote had some edge<br/>on them.<br/>   The second player was a totally classical pianist. Her two pianos at home<br/>are kept in a Broadwood&apos;s and a Werckmeister, and she is extremely familiar<br/>with how the classical repertoire is affected by temperament.  She plays<br/>concerts world-wide.    She said she had to look for the contrasts, and that<br/>there really didn&apos;t seem to be the kind of clarity in the simple keys that<br/>she had come to expect, that she was sensing more edge than normal in C and<br/>F.  Normal for her is a little different than most pianists, due to her use<br/>of the Werckmeister.<br/>   A second playing on the more stretched tuning evoked even more of an ET<br/>feel for her, as she said that the tuning sounded more open, but also more<br/>tense.<br/>   The third player was a rock and roller,  he thought it sounded great! It<br/>was the first time I have ever been told that a temperament had balls.<br/>   My personal reaction to this tuning was that the syncronicity is actually<br/>causing the beating to be more pronounced, even when it is slower than ET.<br/>There is enough variation to create the texture that I have come to love, and<br/>that is a good asset in any tuning.  The alignment of the m3 and M3 beating<br/>causes their effect to be stronger.  This is perhaps because of the added<br/>clarity present when there are not two different rates giving rise to a<br/>tertiary result.  I think a side result of this reinforced beating is that<br/>there is less sense of consonance than when the thirds are closer to Just.<br/>The beating is clean and slow, but powerful.<br/>   Maybe it is analogous to the vocalist that NEVER turns off the colortura.<br/>After a while, you find yourself hungering for a steady, pure note.<br/>    I suspect that the die-hard JI advocates will consider the difference<br/>between a Just M3 and one that is tempered by 5 cents,(approx. 1 bps in the<br/>middle of the keyboard), to be a profound difference, but on the acoustic<br/>piano, in the presence of other tempered intervals (5ths,often),  getting the<br/>M3 down to around 1bps is effectively rendering it pure.  When you lose that<br/>level of consonance in the temperament, I think you lose a strong component<br/>in creating contrast, i.e. a 14 cent third isn&apos;t sensed as brilliant in ET,<br/>but in a Kirnberger, it can be wonderfully ethereal when it appears after a<br/>near Just third,(Beethoven&apos;s use of Emaj to introduce the second theme in the<br/>&quot;Waldstein&quot; is a good demo of this.  measure 36, I think).<br/>    Any temperament gives up something to gain something and the value of<br/>that compromise is dependant on the music played on it.   The &quot;Wendell<br/>Natural&quot; is a very nice temperament. It has good balance, and it has a<br/>characteristic &apos;sound&apos; that its coordinated tempering creates. This is no<br/>small feat!  Creating a tuning that produces a characteristic sound is true<br/>art.  I think the loss of contrast suffered to create syncronicity works to<br/>its disadvantage with music that depends on the classical tonal soundscape,<br/>but is a very strong asset for music that makes use of dense and harmonically<br/>complex chords, like jazz.<br/>  I hope to have time to try the stronger, more robust Wendell tunings in the<br/>future,  I suspect they may be stronger candidates for the pre-1900<br/>repertoire.

How&apos;s everything in Nashville? I grew up an hour from there<br/>in Clarksville and lived in Nashville the 5 years before moving here<br/>to Iowa at the beginning of 1982. Used to record the Blair String<br/>Quartet for national syndication through NPR when I was working for<br/>WPLN-FM. They really liked my work.</p><p>I really appreciate the thorough feedback you&apos;ve given me. I trust<br/>your tuner&apos;s ear over most musicians&apos;, especially pianists, since<br/>they typically don&apos;t have much of a clue when it comes to precise<br/>intonation of any kind. I find the comments from your clients<br/>experienced with wells informative, however. They are pretty much<br/>along the lines of what I would expect under the conditions you&apos;ve<br/>described.</p><p>I agree that the beating is emphasized by the synchrony. I have<br/>received a fair amount of feedback outside this list from tuners<br/>relaying to me client reaction as well as their own. Most like<br/>the &quot;vibrato&quot; or &quot;tremolo&quot; effect of the synchrony. They feel it<br/>lends a singing quality. I also consistently and repeatedly receive<br/>feedaback from tuner that the pianos sound &quot;louder, more alive&quot;, and<br/>tha the &quot;voicing&quot; seems to have greater clarity even though they did<br/>nothing to change the voicing.</p><p>I personally find it makes the key color more obvious in a<br/>temperament that is otherwise mild enough to reduce key color to<br/>barely perceptible levels for most clients. Ironically, at the same<br/>time many find that the &quot;harder-edged&quot; harmonies in the remote keys<br/>are ameliorated by the synchrony. I find this true for my own ear<br/>also. I like the key contrast becoming more obvious with a<br/>simultaneous reduction in &quot;grittiness&quot;.</p><p>Some tuners have been pushing me for a milder temeperament that they<br/>could tune without advising their clients. These tuners tend to have<br/>ears that are very sensitive to the sharper thirds on the more remote<br/>keys. I have one client who is not a tuner, and who had difficulty<br/>hearing the beats at first, even with the synchrony emphasizing them.<br/>However, he complained about +17.9 cents on the thirds in that<br/>particular temperament. His melodic/harmonic sense of what a good<br/>third is was more acute than most pianists I&apos;ve encountered, in spite<br/>of his initial insensitivity to the beating, which he now notices and<br/>enjoys.</p><p>The Natural Well is slightly less sharp at the extreme end, at only<br/>+17.6 cents on Db and Ab. This same client said that Chopin<br/>sounds &quot;way better&quot; in that temperament, however (so similar to the<br/>Natural that I&apos;ve eliminated it from my intonational &quot;toolkit&quot;).</p><p>One tuner aslso had a client for whom he tuned my Synchronous ET<br/>Equivalent. It has no significant key contrast, but perfect synchrony<br/>everywhere except on one fifth. He said his client perceied the<br/>synchrony as a &quot;tremolo&quot; and found it &quot;totally lovely&quot;. So everything<br/>is  a tradeoff depending on who&apos;s listening and to what music. What<br/>else is new, right?!</p><p>Thank you again for your very thorough and astute feedback, Ed!</p><p>Gratefully,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, a440a@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;  Robert Wendel posts:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A short time ago, I posted the 12t-ET offsets requested for two of<br/>my<br/>&gt; mild well temperaments.
