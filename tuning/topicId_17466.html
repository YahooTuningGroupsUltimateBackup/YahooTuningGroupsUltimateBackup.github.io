I had been looking for a JI<br/>scale based on the triad 3:5:7 in the framework of 3:1 when I discovered what<br/>I called the &quot;13-step scale&quot; at that time. It occurred one day in spring<br/>1972, in Hamburg, Germany, as the result of a lengthy investigation<br/>concerning consonance with combination tones and harmonics. But there were<br/>only hours or perhaps a day (I don&apos;t remember that so exactly anymore; old<br/>age is claiming its toll) between that discovery and finding, that equal<br/>temperament of the scale was such a close fit. Yes, the scale was perceived<br/>as a &quot;chromatic&quot; JI scale first, but it was the near-congruence with the<br/>equal-tempered version that made it exciting for me. Consequently, the first<br/>still sketchy write-up presents (like the following papers) the &quot;13-step<br/>scale&quot; in both a JI and an ET chromatic form and additionally in four 9-step<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; modes.</p><p>The next in line was - no, not John Pierce yet - it was Kees van Prooijen in<br/>The Hague, Holland, who in 1978 independently found that a division of the<br/>third harmonic (3:1) into 13 equal steps provided convincing consonance with<br/>odd harmonics. But Kees was at that time reluctant to share his discovery,<br/>and he camouflaged it cunningly in his paper.</p><p>He wouldn&apos;t have needed to do that; news of the scale didn&apos;t make it to the<br/>USA anyway, obviously. Thus the stage was free for a third discovery of the<br/>scale in 1984, this time by famous John Pierce in Palo Alto, California.<br/>Regrettably, I never got a chance to talk to John about the scale (not that I<br/>didn&apos;t try), so I can&apos;t tell you how he came across it. But one thing is for<br/>certain: this time the scale caught the attention of a larger circle of<br/>people, and besides investigating it scientifically it is also John&apos;s (or Max<br/>Mathew&apos;s?) merit to have baptized it Bohlen-Pierce.</p><p>There is, though, a &quot;Pierce scale&quot;; it is one of the diatonic modes that John<br/>found especially valuable. And an almost funny bit: all three BP discoverers<br/>are presently living in the Bay Area; John still in Palo Alto, Kees in Mill<br/>Valley, I in Mountain View. It seems to be a place that favors odd harmonics.</p><p>By the way: most of this is narrated and documented at the BP site<br/>(<a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/references.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/references.html</a>).</p><p>Heinz</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2001 6:44:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, HPBOHLEN@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17466">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17466</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, one part of Paul&apos;s opinion is correct.
