(At least we did not take any money.)  However, I am embarrassed<br/>that we had thought we could be in production before this point.  The reason,<br/>other than the usual time constraints and a severe economic depression, is that<br/>the person hired to do the mastering quit midstream.</p><p>Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yours truly, Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director, AFMM</p></div>
