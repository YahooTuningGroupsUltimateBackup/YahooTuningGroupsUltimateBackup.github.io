I am used to Brindle&apos;s &apos;Serial Composition&apos;,<br/>in which a &apos;series&apos; or &apos;set&apos; is defined as an ordered sequence of the 12<br/>pitch classes of 12EDO, without repetition. I was making a common musical<br/>mistake, and forgetting that &apos;set theory&apos; prefers a more rigorous<br/>definition, but entirely of a different kind, like having a predicate<br/>calculus operator or something...</p><p>So I meant good-ol&apos; serial music, or set or row, for a &apos;really old fashioned<br/>term&apos;</p><p>That&apos;s what happens when you mix music an mathematics - everyone with<br/>crossed definitions.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?? yes, i think mark was actually thinking of a &quot;series&quot; (as in<br/>&gt; serial music) or something,</p><p>I don&apos;t wan&apos;t to think that I am marginalising  - but there are some who<br/>would marginalise others:</p><p>jon (&quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a>&gt;) says:</p><p>&gt; And while I have often called for civility (and tried to do it in a<br/>&gt; non-condescending manner), we are going to be looking at some very personal,<br/>&gt; artistic decisions that are being discussed. These areas are not data, or<br/>&gt; theorems, or factoids to be proved or disproved. I expect people to argue - on<br/>&gt; both sides - with both head *and* heart. A fair number of points Ms. Werntz<br/>&gt; puts forward are not merely the 0/1 of factual content, but opinion and<br/>&gt; preference.</p><p>Which is my point about the Werntz article - it makes out that everyone else<br/>is wrong and only ms Werntz is right. I&apos;m sorry, but this is a musical<br/>democracy. Unlike whoever said that &quot;I disagree with what you say, but I&apos;ll<br/>defend to the death your right to say it&quot;, I will not defend people who<br/>would take away the right to free speech. And that is what ms Werntz is<br/>implying by her dismissal of JI ideas, suggesting that we all use little<br/>series of microtonal pitches from an EDO scale, with lots of micropolyphony<br/>and microgradus ad parnassum (apologies Claude, and l&apos;Ecole).</p><p>My own article is based around EDOs, and it also discusses JI. I feel that<br/>one is an approximation to the other. Note I state this as a feeling, an<br/>opinion, not as a pseudo-fact. Some EDOs approximate to very little in JI,<br/>yet they are very &apos;musical&apos;, viz the dicussion on 11EDO recently.</p><p>But, how you or I choose our notes is, to some extent, a personal thing.<br/>Whatever the philosophy that gave rise to the notes, only the notes will be<br/>left in the end. Wagner is a case in point. No rational person would<br/>subscribe to his philosophy today (well, there are some...), but his impact<br/>on music as a composer is undeniable. And this goes for Schoenberg,<br/>Partch... you name the composer. Their life and methods are unimportant -<br/>only their music.</p><p>There is no tuning war.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2002 1:50:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; My fault.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consequences of being UK based.

Mostly, this would still be a formality, but in some cases it could get interesting and might help keep the academic world just a tiny bit less ingrown. The idea that someone outside of the department has to sign off on your thesis and your qualifying exam is in practice a joke, but preventing departments from becoming ingrown is the idea behind it. It seems to me now we&apos;ve got something else we could try.</p></div>
