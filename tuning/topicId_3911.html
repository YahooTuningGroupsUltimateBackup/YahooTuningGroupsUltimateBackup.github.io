In addition to Dale&apos;s point, there is the fact that<br/>nonlinearities in the ear-brain system produce a potentially endless set of<br/>combination tones, which tend to make a noisy mess of frequencies unless the<br/>stimulus is a simple subset of a harmonic series, in which case all the<br/>combination tones are members of that same harmonic series. That&apos;s Kraig&apos;s<br/>favorite phenomenon. Both of those phenomena favor otonal chords and work<br/>well even for sine waves or timbres with inharmonic content. For timbres<br/>with harmonic partials, there is a third phenomenon at work: the beating and<br/>roughness created when partials from different tones don&apos;t quite coincide.<br/>This is the favorite phenomenon of<br/>Helmholtz/Plomp/Kameoka&amp;Kuriyagawa/Sethares, and favors both otonal and<br/>utonal chords.</p><p>&gt;If you really want a temperament that resists any kind of comparison with<br/>just intervals,<br/>&gt;19-tone ET is a bad choice, since many of its intervals (especially the<br/>minor thirds) are too<br/>&gt;close.
