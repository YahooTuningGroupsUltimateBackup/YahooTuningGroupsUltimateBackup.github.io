Could you please spell out, if you have the<br/>time,<br/>&gt; &gt; how these &quot;adjacencies&quot; work and how they differ from a<br/>periodicity<br/>&gt; &gt; block...??  I&apos;ve gotta know this, or at least get a glimmer.<br/>&gt; &gt; Probably once I see it, I&apos;ll understand it, since I&apos;ve been over<br/>&gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; of this before...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; open up _the forms of tonality_, which is probably right next to<br/>you<br/>&gt; right now. it illustrates the answers to these very questions, in a<br/>&gt; form that most of its reviewers found very clear and accessible.<br/>read<br/>&gt; the mentions of tonality diamonds and periodicity blocks with<br/>&gt; particular attention.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thanks so much, Paul, for your response, which I mostly<br/>understood.  I&apos;ll reread _The Forms of Tonality_ which is, indeed,<br/>practically in front of me, and I&apos;ll be back with a few more<br/>questions...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=45026 href="#45026">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2003 5:41:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_44706.html#44727">/tuning/topicId_44706.html#44727</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; So, I guess we need to mitigate our perceptions that Blackjack is<br/>&gt; &gt; first and formost a *harmonic* scale.  I *thought* that was<br/>&gt; partially<br/>&gt; &gt; what you were saying at one point.  Maybe you&apos;re rethinking it?  Or<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe I didn&apos;t fully understand you the first time (more probable :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, let&apos;s put it this way. it&apos;s created with the goal of a certain<br/>&gt; &quot;homogeneity&quot; (not too many sizes of each generic interval type) and<br/>&gt; &quot;uniformity&quot; (covering the whole octave span somewhat evenly) in<br/>&gt; pitch, and these are not harmonic series considerations, but good<br/>&gt; voice-leading would be hard without them. but i don&apos;t see the<br/>&gt; blackjack scale as a melodic entity in itself, the way the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale or the 5-to-9 tone scales used in world musics are. so maybe we<br/>&gt; should say &quot;voice-leading properties&quot; instead of &quot;melodic&quot; properties?<br/>&gt; i don&apos;t know, the music you&apos;re creating kind of makes these old<br/>&gt; terminologies difficult to apply . . .</p><p>Not really. Melodic properties are those that relate to pitches<br/>occurring one after the other in time, or to the approximate<br/>magnitudes of the intervals, in particular the step intervals, whereas<br/>Harmonic properties relate to notes sounding simultaneously and often<br/>depend more precisely on intervals&apos; deviations from small whole number<br/>ratios.</p><p>To talk of the Melodic properties of a tuning does not (to me) imply<br/>that the tuning is itself a melodic entity or is capable of being<br/>perceived as a melodic gestalt.</p><p>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s hard to draw a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sharp line between &quot;melodic&quot; and &quot;harmonic&quot; properties, but<br/>&gt; &gt; certainly the choice of 21 notes to create an MOS looks more like<br/>&gt; &gt; a &quot;melodic&quot; than a &quot;harmonic&quot; decision in this light . . .</p><p>It _is_ a melodic decision. The fact that, as Paul has discovered,<br/>MOSs or well formed scales correspond to periodicity blocks, does not<br/>make it a harmonic property, because the reason for carving out a<br/>periodicity block from a JI lattice is itself, at least partly, a<br/>melodic one. Namely to have a scale with few comma-sized step intervals.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, Blackjack melodies *are* interesting and<br/>&gt; &gt; distinctive, even though the scale wasn&apos;t designed so much with them<br/>&gt; &gt; in mind...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; well, that&apos;s all true enough, and i guess i see your point better<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; now. i think i&apos;d just go for a &quot;freer&quot; use of the blackjack<br/>&gt; pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to create beautiful melodies, rather than just running them up and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; down (83 cents, 33 cents, 83 cents, 33 cents . . .) but that may<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***No, not really.  I&apos;m already not doing that anymore in my very<br/>&gt; &gt; most recent piece (being composed right now... well not right this<br/>&gt; &gt; *very* now, I&apos;m on this damn list...)

I think rather that there are so many, it is hard to choose<br/>one for a given piece.</p><p>Of course once such a melodic scale is established in the piece, it<br/>might be allowed to modulate.

(Always<br/>&gt; the fun part... :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have time to get into this. Way back we did list<br/>many subsets (or near-subsets) of Blackjack that Manuel found in the<br/>Scala archive. You can use recent versions of Scala to do this<br/>yourself. Just SET MAX DIFF to 5 cents before using the COMPARE<br/>/SUBSETS function or something like that.</p><p>But you could also approach it in this way: Melodically we can<br/>consider Blackjack to be 10-tET with inflections. There are 9 clusters<br/>of 2 notes and 1 cluster of 3 notes, but treat all the clusters as<br/>equals at first and consider each cluster as if it were a single note.</p><p>Treat 10-EDO in the Blackjack case as analogous to 12-EDO in the usual<br/>case. Now start knocking out notes (corresponding to whole clusters in<br/>Blackjack), but don&apos;t knock out two adjacent ones (at least for a<br/>first pass). How many ways can you do this to 10-EDO and end up with a<br/>unique scale of 5 to 9 notes (treating rotations as equivalent)? i.e.<br/>There&apos;s only one with 5 notes, probably very boring, and only one with<br/>9 notes, probably too many notes to really grok. I think there are 4<br/>with 8 notes (but forget the symmetrical one), 5 with 7 notes and 2<br/>with 6 notes. Drawing decimal clock-faces might help in finding these.<br/>Now use Scala to find the Rothenberg-stability of each of these (as<br/>actual subsets of 10-EDO not Blackjack), and pick the one with the<br/>greatest stability to try first.</p><p>Now having chosen a subset of 10-EDO we have to choose how to<br/>translate it back into Blackjack. The only real issue is which note to<br/>map to the  3-cluster. Maximising JI harmonies might be used to help<br/>in deciding this, or it might be based on finer-grained melodic<br/>considerations. We might also want to decide which note in each<br/>cluster is to be considered the &quot;natural&quot; or uninflected note. But<br/>that might not be important, or could be decided later.</p><p>So we would be working from purely melodic considerations, trusting<br/>that simply by limiting ourselves to notes within Blackjack we are<br/>likely to have many harmonic possibilities.</p><p>You might get someone on tuning-math to help with the above<br/>theoretical prioritising of choices, but since there are only about 10<br/>worth trying, you might simply use trial and error. Just mark 2 or 3<br/>or 4 per octave, of the 33 cent clusters, on your keyboard, in some<br/>way meaning &quot;do not use&quot;, and fool around.</p><p>Actually it would be a useful experiment to have you choose your<br/>favourite without knowing anything about Rothenberg stability.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
