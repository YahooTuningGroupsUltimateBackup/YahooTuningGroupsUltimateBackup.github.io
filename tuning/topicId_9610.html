He&apos;s been kind enough to put lots of material on the subject on<br/>&gt; the Web, and will no doubt be adding more once he gets settled in<br/>&gt; California. You could start with<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also go to <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/pblock.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/pblock.htm</a> and follow the<br/>&gt; links from there. When Joe visited me in Boston, he made it a point to ask<br/>&gt; me about finity and I mentioned that Fokker&apos;s periodicity block formalism<br/>&gt; seemed to get at the same idea. Since then, I&apos;ve looked into the concept<br/>&gt; more deeply and posted many articles on it (search the archives for<br/>&gt; &quot;periodicity&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be happy to help you if any of the material you find is unclear.</p></div>
