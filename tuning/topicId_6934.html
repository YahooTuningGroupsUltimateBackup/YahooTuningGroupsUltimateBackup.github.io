I bought a used<br/>one for almost nothing, and have been doing what I (maybe erroneously)<br/>think are amazing compositions in 1/8th tones just with some of the preset<br/>tunings....  In addition, I spoke with a friend who has LOTS of equipment,<br/>and he assures me that the feature of the TX81Z which allows any pitch to<br/>be placed ANYWHERE on the sound spectrum (within the TX81Z tuning units) is<br/>a fairly unusual feature for any synthesizer.</p><p>Although great for microtonal composition, I guess the only real limitation<br/>of the TX81Z is the number of voices -- only 8.  This is a little (!)<br/>problematic for orchestral pieces -- but fortunately the abovementioned<br/>friend was able to transcribe my orchestral piece into MIDI using several<br/>synthesizers...</p><p>Does anyone have opinions on the Proteus 2000?  Would this be a worthwhile<br/>upgrade??  Actually, I don&apos;t want to upgrade at the moment.  I love my<br/>&quot;humble&quot; TX81Z...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=6937 href="#6937">ðŸ”—</a>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/14/1999 7:39:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/15/1999 01:27:28 AM, <a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;I would like to sing the praises of the &quot;humble&quot; TX81Z.
