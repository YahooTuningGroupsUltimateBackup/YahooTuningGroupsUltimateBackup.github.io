I forgot to mention several lifelong<br/>favorites; but, I also realized how to sum up what great, enduring art<br/>means to me. Favewise, the Beatles are tops...I like them more now than<br/>when I was a kid. I guess I forgot to mention them because it&apos;s such a<br/>natural part of who I am. Miles Davis really steered me in my curent<br/>direction; &quot;In A Silent Way&quot; was the 1st thing I heard by him...he<br/>created a whole genre, sent 20th century music off into the future.<br/>(And, that&apos;s what Dan S. does for me now). &quot;Peer Gynt,&quot; by Grieg, has<br/>been close to my heart for over 30 years, as has &quot;The Planets,&quot; by<br/>Holst. How about Marty Robbins, whose music, to me, is like going to the<br/>movies? Or, Lenny Breau, Thumbs Carlisle, Chet Atkins, all the great<br/>American guitar players?  Duke Ellington, Jobim, Turkish, Vietnamese,<br/>Chinese, African, Native American...they all sort of run together as<br/>parts of a much bigger pattern, and I enjoy listening to as many varied<br/>styles and concepts as I can.<br/>    But, and here&apos;s my definition, it&apos;s the art I keep coming back to,<br/>year after year, that is great...I&apos;ve listened to Bach so many times<br/>that it&apos;s amazing to me; yet, he always kicks my ass, always sounds like<br/>the first time. Same with &quot;Martian Chronicles,&quot; or &quot;Dune;&quot; I&apos;ll be<br/>reading these when they cart me off. So, that&apos;s what great is to<br/>me...that which lasts the ages...Hstick</p></div>
