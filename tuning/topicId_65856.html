The event is, of course, what you make of it.  There is the idea of<br/>collecting many recordings of people&apos;s doings and mixing them into one giganto-podcast<br/>by the end of it.  Of course, it is not limited to the internet, what better excuse to spread<br/>the microtonal gospel (you know, the one thing everybody here agrees on? right? oh,<br/>forget it) in a more forward way.</p><p>Anyhow, if you&apos;re interested, you have a free hour to record some music between now and<br/>next Saturday (April 8th), and you&apos;d like to contribute to the podcast bit, do visit http://<br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.org/mmmday06">xenharmony.wikispaces.org/mmmday06</a> and add your name to the list.</p><p>Thanks fer hearin&apos; me out,<br/>jacob</p></div>
