Just as we can<br/>think of the 12-et (actually, the 12-et meantone) as 7+5, we can<br/>start by chopping up 22 notes into white keys and black keys; if each<br/>of these is reasonable as an et the result will be also.</p><p>If we allow that the 12-et is, after all, a reasonable et, the<br/>obvious place to start is with 12+10. We have 12/10 = 6/5 = 1+1/5, so<br/>we may approximate it by 1/1; using these as numerators and 5 and 6<br/>as denominators, we get 1/6 &lt; 2/11 &lt; 1/5, where the 2/11 is the<br/>mediant, obtained by adding (1+1)/(6+5) = 2/11. We can find how many<br/>generator steps it takes to reach a given interval q (modulo half-<br/>octaves) by the formula</p><p>gen(q) = 6 g10(q) - 5 g12(q),</p><p>where g12 measures how many steps are taken in the 12-et, and g10 how<br/>many in the 10-et, where these should be chosen so as to add up to<br/>the steps in the 22-et.</p><p>We have the following table:</p><p>12  10  22  0<br/>19  16  35  1<br/>28  23  51 -2<br/>34  28  62 -2<br/>41  35  76  5</p><p>The first column is the 12-et, counting steps for 2,3,5,7, and 11;<br/>the second is the 10-et and the third is their sum, 22, for the same<br/>intervals. The last column is gen(q), 6 times the 10 column minus 5<br/>times the 12 column. So this tells us that to get a 3, we go up one<br/>generator--which might seem wrong, until we recall we are working<br/>modulo half-octaves, so that a half-octave plus a semitone (our<br/>generator) gives us a fifth--which we may also view as the generator,<br/>so that this is a circle-of-fifths system. To get a 7 we go down 2,<br/>so that 7/4 is a tone below the octave, indicative of the fact that<br/>this is a septimal comma system, where 9/8 and 8/7 are represented by<br/>the same interval. Since 5/7 is represented by the half-octave (we<br/>have 50/49 in our system of commas also), the 5 is also 2 tones down,<br/>as the table tells us. The final column can also be obtained by<br/>modulo-11 arithmetic, so that 1 = 35/2 mod 11, -2 = 51/2 mod 11, and<br/>so forth.</p><p>The last row, for 11, has 11 represented by 2^(41/12); we need this<br/>value if we are to use 2^(35/10) for the 10-et; otherwise, we must<br/>use 2^(34/10) since in any event the two must sum to 76. One way<br/>gives us 5, as above, and the other way gives us -6; but 76/2 = 5 =<br/>-6 mod 11, so both are acceptable. Either way we get a span of<br/>7 between the 11 and the 5 or 7, so a complexity of 2*7 = 14 for the<br/>11-limit. Similarly, we have a complexity of 8 for the 9-limit (since<br/>a 3 is 1, a 9 is 2) and 6 for the 7-limit. Because the 10 and 12 ets<br/>are relatively reasonable in the 7-limit, gen(q) cannot be too large;<br/>11 is not as well approximated and we find gen(11) to be larger.<br/>Another way to look at the generator calculation is in fact in terms<br/>of the relative error; consider the following table:</p><p> -23   180   157   2400<br/> 164  -263   -99  -4800<br/> 374   -88   286  -4800<br/>-616   487  -129  12000</p><p>The first column is the error of the 12 et in relative cents, so that<br/>the 3 is 23 rc flat, the 5 is 164 rc sharp, and so forth. The second<br/>column is the error of the 10-et, and the third column is the error<br/>of the 22-et, which in relative cents is simply the sum of 12 and 10;<br/>to get the absolute error in cents you divide by 22. The fourth<br/>column is 12 times the 10 error minus 10 times the 12 error; because<br/>of round-off error the results we get by using the tabulated values<br/>are slightly different; but they are close enough that dividing<br/>through by 1200 clearly gives us 2, -4, -4, 10; and from these<br/>|-4-10| = 14 as the 11-complexity, and so forth.</p><p>From our 10+12=22 starting point, we know that 10 and 12 note scales<br/>will be sensible choices, which means 5 or 6 notes out of 11. We get<br/>either (22223)x2 or (222221)x2 for our scales, and a good supply of<br/>7-harmony. Of course we are not required to be as symmetrical as<br/>possible, and Paul is quite fond of 6 fifths vs 4 fifths. Paul tells<br/>us the decatonic 22-et is the first scale he constructed, and he<br/>takes a sort of fatherly interest, I think. I&apos;m fond of 7 fifths vs 5<br/>fifths myself, and that was the outcome of my first efforts--<br/>suffering under the delusion that the diatonic scale arose by<br/>tempering the just diatonic via equal temperament, I attempted to<br/>replicate the process--and succeeded. You can get these scales, among<br/>other ways, by constructing scales analogous to the diatonic (for 10,<br/>12, 15, 22, 31 etc notes) with superparticular ratios and all the<br/>rest of it, and then introducing approximations--a similar but less<br/>sophisticated process than tempering a block.</p><p>After 12+10 the next most obvious choice is 15+7; the 15-division is<br/>not as precise as 12 in its tuning of triads but both the 15 and the<br/>7 ets do reasonably well up to 11, so this should be an interesting<br/>choice for exploring the 11-limit possibilities of the 22-et. From<br/>15/7 = 2+1/7 we get numerators of 2 and 1, respectively, and locate<br/>our generator by 2/15 &lt; 3/22 &lt; 1/7. Using either 15h7 - 7h15 or<br/>mod 22 arithmetic, we find a 5-limit complexity of 6, 7-limit of 11,<br/>9-limit of 12, 11-limit of 12 and even 13-limit of 12, though the<br/>22-et is not especially good up to the 13-limit. From considering 15<br/>and 7 together, we see that this system is associated to the commas<br/>64/63 (septimal comma), 385/384 (Keenan&apos;s kleisma) as well as the<br/>as-yet-unnamed intervals of 875/864, 55/54, 100/99, 121/120 and<br/>176/175. The 7-note scale has pattern 3333334, 15 notes gives us the<br/>pattern 212121212121211 and a good supply of 11-limit chords, and we<br/>can use 8 notes and 33333331 if we like as well.</p><p>From 19/3 = 6+1/3 we get 6/19 &lt; 7/22 &lt; 1/3; since this generator is<br/>about 1/pi, the numerologically inclined might consider precisely pi<br/>generators to the octave; perhaps Lucy will try it if he ever gets<br/>bored with Lucy-tuning. The generator is a flattened major third,<br/>whether in the 22-et version or the slightly less flat 2^(1/pi)<br/>version, and as we would expect from its genesis from 19 and 3, this<br/>is a good system if we want to focus on the triad-generating powers<br/>of the 22-et. It has a 5-limit complexity of 5, representing 3 by<br/>five successive major thirds. Hence the fundamental comma for this<br/>system is the small diesis of (1/3)(5/4)^5 = 3125/3072. While it is a<br/>bit of a stretch to claim 19 notes out of 22 constitute a scale, we<br/>could try instead a 7-note alternative to the diatonic scale, with<br/>pattern 6161611, a 10-note scale with pattern 5115115111, or a<br/>13-note scale with pattern 4111411141111. We can construct a 7-note<br/>PB for the 7-note scale by using either the augmented second of 75/64<br/>or the diminished third of 144/125 as our chroma, and the small<br/>diesis as a comma. We get from 75/64 the rotation of the Pythagorean<br/>scale by 120 degrees; that is, by sending 3--&gt;16/5, and from 144/125<br/>we get a few minor thirds as well as major thirds:</p><p>1--25/24--5/4--125/96--192/125--8/5--48/25--(2)</p><p>With the small diesis approximation, this gives us some triads, and<br/>both scales are the same mode in 22-et: 1616161, what you might call<br/>the moment-of-symmetry mode, symmetrical around the middle 6. However<br/>the first mode given, 6161611, has both a major and a minor triad on<br/>the first scale degree, and a major and minor triad on the third<br/>scale degree, a major third above it, which might serve as this<br/>scale&apos;s version of tonic and dominant.</p><p>Other possibilities are the 18+4 system, with generator<br/>4/9 &lt; 5/11 &lt; 1/2, with a 7-limit complexity of 8 and scales of<br/>patterns (41411)x2  and (3113111)x2, the 14+8 system, with generator<br/>1/4 &lt; 3/11 &lt; 2/7 and a 5-complexity of 10, a 7-complexity of 10, a<br/>9-complexity of 12 and an 11-complexity of 12, and scales of pattern<br/>(3332)x2 and (1212122)x2, and the 17+5 system, which as we might<br/>expect does well for 3-complexity, being in fact the Margo scales, of<br/>22-et fifths. We have the Margo diatonic, 4414441, and the hyper-<br/>Pythagorean temperament, 313113131311.</p></div><h3><a id=29176 href="#29176">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2001 1:52:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>[lots of stuff skipped]</p><p>Gene, you said 22 is well-known, but . . . very little has been<br/>written about it compared with 19, 24, 31, and 53. 22 is not nearly<br/>as well-known as it deserves to be -- the main obstacle having been<br/>the &apos;comma problem&apos; -- but this being the 21st century, it&apos;s time<br/>make music outside the common-practice language, out where the &apos;comma<br/>problem&apos; can be either a non-issue or a desirable feature.
