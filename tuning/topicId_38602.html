It is difficult &gt;&gt; for anyone to<br/>&gt;&gt; publish a theory of music that is not naive.  Paul could try &gt;&gt; to measure on a<br/>&gt;&gt; scale of naivete for theory manifestos.  I am sure that Julia &gt;&gt; meant well,<br/>&gt;&gt; believing that of most human beings.  But she does not share &gt;&gt; the musical<br/>&gt;&gt; languages that others are fluent with.  My musical life &gt;&gt; flourishes with<br/>&gt;&gt; improvisation and composition, with performance and &gt;&gt; production.  It is a rich<br/>&gt;&gt; and fascinating world we share and there are a myriad of &gt;&gt; perspectives.  How<br/>&gt;&gt; can one rule one superior to another?  Isn&apos;t this like &gt;&gt; cultural hegemony?<br/>&gt;</p><p>On Tuesday, July 9, 2002, at 02:24 , <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;  <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Re: More Understanding-to Julia.2</p><p>&gt; Julia, you have not been clear.</p><p>Like crystal, actually.</p><p>&gt;  Otherwise, there would not be a &quot;perception&quot;<br/>&gt; that you are intolerant.</p><p>I&apos;m quite certain it is respondents here who have been intolerant.</p><p>&gt; And I think the usage by PNM is paramount to what is gained by you.</p><p>You should clarify what you mean by this statement that can be interpreted to be ungracious, to put it lightly.</p><p>&gt; Clearly, we are<br/>&gt; bewildered about what you are in fact are saying.</p><p>Hmm, I&apos;ve understood her quite well.

But if an idiot savant like me can adjust my thinking cap enough to grasp her ideas very clearly as is, I have my doubts.</p><p>&gt;  In fact, I am hurt that you think I am<br/>&gt; engaging in sport that is hurtful.  Aren&apos;t you wildly &gt; exaggerating here?</p><p>I don&apos;t think she&apos;s exaggerating. Personally, if I were in her shoes, with her credentials, I&apos;d be a lot more forthright in my response to you.</p><p>&gt; What I am saying (in this imperfect medium) is that unless you &gt; are drawing<br/>&gt; distinctions between things, I am not sure why or what you are saying</p><p>You&apos;re not criticising what you don&apos;t even understand, are you ?</p><p>I&apos;m sure (I hope !) you didn&apos;t mean it to come out that way, but I found most of your responses to Julia hovering between pompous and patronising. The low points of the entire we-<br/>don&apos;t-understand-Julia-she-must-be-an-idiot thread.</p><p>In all modesty I could boil down what she says into between one and three sentences. I&apos;ve tried to explain in a couple of posts (at least), so has Paul E., and so has Julia herself.</p><p>The most bizarre bits here have been people saying that Julia&apos;s choice of 72-ED2:1 is wrong. As Kraig pointed out, the pudding proves otherwise. I&apos;m sure some of you found it radical (dangerous ?) where she suggests that the selection of scale/tonal system/tuning is not important. Recently wasn&apos;t there similar lunacy with people telling Alison she&apos;s using the wrong scale/tuning/tonal system ?</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=38607 href="#38607">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2002 12:54:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Joel Rodrigues &lt;joelrodrigues@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Recently wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; there similar lunacy with people telling Alison she&apos;s using the<br/>&gt; wrong scale/tuning/tonal system ?</p><p>to the best of my understanding, no one did any such thing. but i<br/>agree with the rest of your points in this post, joel.</p></div><h3><a id=38608 href="#38608">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2002 1:02:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Joel Rodrigues &lt;joelrodrigues@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The most bizarre bits here have been people saying that Julia&apos;s<br/>&gt; choice of 72-ED2:1 is wrong.</p><p>Are you talking to me? :)</p><p>All I&apos;ve said is that *if* certain claims which have been made on this list about her musical intentions are true, then 72-et is far from an optimal choice, and certainly a curious one.</p><p>&gt; Recently wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; there similar lunacy with people telling Alison she&apos;s using the<br/>&gt; wrong scale/tuning/tonal system ?</p><p>I have no idea, but if so, so what?
