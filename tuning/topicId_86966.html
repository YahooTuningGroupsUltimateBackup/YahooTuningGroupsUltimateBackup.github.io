Do you miss the ligatures<br/>&gt; in modern notation, or what are you missing?</p><p>Well, I guess I&apos;m rather a purist when it comes to notation.</p><p>I mean, the notations are completely different, and IMO modern<br/>notation is a corruption of the early art. It is an imposition that<br/>obscures the techniques of that art, rendering the music<br/>in ways the composers never conceived and would not<br/>understand. Kind of like playing any of that music on a 12ET piano<br/>and wondering why it does not sound compelling. In terms of the<br/>notation, several basic things were so different as to be ruined by<br/>translation to modern notation:</p><p>- Barlines? They did not exist; there was only the mensurstricht. When<br/>you replace a stricht with a barline, you are dividing things up where<br/>they didn&apos;t divide that way.</p><p>- Meter? Tempus and prolation are totally different concepts than the<br/>modern idea of meter. Putting a meter there changes the idea of pulse<br/>in the music.</p><p>- Accidentals? There was the practice of ficta, not written accidentals.<br/>Writing them in the score is completely editorial.</p><p>- Key? There was no &quot;key&quot;. There were not even &quot;modes&quot; in the modern<br/>sense. Their ideas of composition were interval and pattern based in<br/>ways that are not expressible when the idea of &quot;key&quot; is imposed.</p><p>Modern scores make the music look like the composers used modern<br/>techniques when they did not. Their techniques were in many ways<br/>more advanced and deeper than modern formulae, such as in terms of<br/>meter, just take a look at Ockeghem&apos;s Missa Prolationem where canons<br/>unfold at metrical relationships that are as far out as anything in the 20th<br/>century, but it was all a product of the metrical technique / worldview /<br/>bag of tricks of that time in the hands of a very creative fellow.</p><p>Compare these two scores (not the same piece, mind you, this was a<br/>one minute Google search):<br/>first an ancient codex:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/anaigeon/mes_facs/fsock.jpg">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/anaigeon/mes_facs/fsock.jpg</a>&gt;<br/>next a modern transcription (click on the small score images):<br/>&lt;<a href="http://obrechtmass.com/explore/ecce.php">http://obrechtmass.com/explore/ecce.php</a>&gt;</p><p>AAH<br/>=====</p></div><h3><a id=86976 href="#86976">ðŸ”—</a>hpiinstruments &#x3C;aaronhunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2010 7:59:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just to be clear, I have only meagre knowledge of those techniques<br/>myself and I didn&apos;t say all those things just to be picky or to show off.<br/>I only said them because if Petr is interested in the real tuning then<br/>he must also be interested in the real art itself because it&apos;s all bound<br/>up together, as different notations have historical tuning implications. I<br/>forgot to mention the staff and moveable C clefs as compared to<br/>modern staff and Treble and Bass as well. And that a &apos;score&apos; was not<br/>as such! There were reasons for all those things and given a choice<br/>between the new way and the old way, they would choose the old way<br/>because notation and tuning are linked together; that is what I meant<br/>to say with all that.<br/>Yours,<br/>AAH<br/>=====</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Torsten Anders &lt;torsten.anders@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 10.03.2010, at 00:48, hpiinstruments wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Look for scores in the original<br/>&gt; &gt; notation, not modern transcriptions (same goes for Palestrina -<br/>&gt; &gt; Modern notation screws the whole thing up!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could you please elaborate this a bit.
