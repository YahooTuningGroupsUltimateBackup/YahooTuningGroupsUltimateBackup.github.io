I&apos;ve had arguments with theory profs for years<br/>about just what is and what is not &quot;harmony.&quot; It all seems to swirl around<br/>the idea that what they mean by &quot;harmony&quot; is very specific, Western<br/>Functional Harmony. Any other vertical sonorities are somehow, not harmony.<br/>Well, to me, ragas and other musics of similar cast definitely exhibit<br/>harmony. It may even be &quot;functional&quot; if one&apos;s willing to hear it with ears<br/>oriented differently.  At 09:07 AM 2/12/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>&gt;for that explanation of Marwa.
