<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Jerry to Paul</h1><h3><a id=8897 href="#8897">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2000 5:55:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To my post:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Does this avoidance of my simple statement mean that you _don&apos;t think that<br/>&gt;&gt;singers are more likely than string players to be influenced by keyboards?<br/>&gt;&gt;My concern here is not that I disagree with your paragraph, but that my<br/>&gt;&gt;statement is not concerned with anything other than the difference in the<br/>&gt;&gt;way singers and string player learn tuning. That&apos;s all.</p><p>Paul insisted:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that the way both string players and singers learn tuning is a far<br/>&gt; more complex issue than simply the degree to which they are directly<br/>&gt; influenced by keyboards. They may primarily be influenced by string players<br/>&gt; and singers they heard while growing up, by the structural characteristics<br/>&gt; of the style of music they play/sing, and perhaps less strongly by their<br/>&gt; experience hearing other instruments.</p><p>Paul, you&apos;re beating a dead horse here. I&apos;ve seen singers all my life<br/>banging out their pitches on a keyboard, or even hiring &quot;vocal coaches&quot; who<br/>do the banging for them. How many violinists do that while &quot;practicing&quot;<br/>their &quot;notes.&quot;</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Paul said:</p><p>&gt; The point I was trying to make with<br/>&gt; the Arabic bit was that each culture establishes its own norms for<br/>&gt; intonation and it is through cultural experience that a feeling of<br/>&gt; certainty, or &quot;naturalness&quot; if you will, is attained by musicians. The fact<br/>&gt; is that today, the third of a pure 4:5:6 sounds &quot;flat&quot; to most musicians (it<br/>&gt; even did to you in some of the examples).</p><p>But then I have &quot;culturized&quot; ears. I can sing a 5/4 third in a triad if I<br/>want to. It sounds nice and mellow. In most contexts, however, I prefer the<br/>high third.</p><p>Some of the students who come to college to &quot;study voice&quot; have established a<br/>sense of &quot;rightness&quot; regarding tuning, but most are still searching for<br/>something close to &quot;acceptable.&quot; Most teachers lead them into the vicinity<br/>of keyboard tuning. Only the lunatic fringe like me would even think about<br/>demonstrating to them that there is a &quot;better&quot; way.</p><p>&gt; To me, that (combined with the<br/>&gt; best historical documentation we have) is evidence that tastes have changed<br/>&gt; and tuning is not simply a matter of acoustical or physiological<br/>&gt; &quot;universals&quot;.</p><p>I never said it was. I simply said that ears are _physically_ the same<br/>everywhere and would therefore process raw sound in a similar manner. That,<br/>dear friend, has nothing to do with style, taste, or keyboards. It may, as<br/>you suggested earlier, have to do with selective perception through learned<br/>&quot;concepts,&quot; but here again, realize that many of my beginning students can&apos;t<br/>even tune to the piano (gee, I wonder why) and find their _first_ success at<br/>tuning when they learn to listen to each other. Something tells me this<br/>would happen in any part of the world, regardless of the musical culture.</p><p>--------------</p><p>Regarding the use of &quot;tonal,&quot; Paul said:</p><p>&gt; Why don&apos;t we say &quot;common practice&quot; instead and<br/>&gt; move on.</p><p>Sounds like a good move. Viva &quot;progress.&quot;</p><p>----------------</p><p>Paul clarified:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, Jerry, the post of Margo&apos;s that I was anticipating was not the<br/>&gt; one you liked so much (which I liked too), but the following one<br/>&gt; (&quot;Keyboards, polyphony, and intonation (850-1640)&quot;). Give that one a good<br/>&gt; read if you find the time.</p><p>I have, Paul, and found it most interesting. I didn&apos;t see anything that<br/>relates to our discussion, however. If your point had to do with the<br/>influence of keyboards on singers, I think it might be best just to forget<br/>it. I&apos;m not buying the notion that raw &quot;acoustic&quot; tuning by singers has<br/>anything to do with keyboards, styles, trends, or anything else of the like.</p><p>If you have further thoughts on that, it might be better to email me<br/>directly. I think our colleagues here have had enough of that stalemate.</p><p>------------</p><p>As always, thanks for your continued interest.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
