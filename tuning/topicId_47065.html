I&apos;ve tuned a Kurzweil 2000 and it<br/>wasn&apos;t too bad. Mainly interested in Tempered. My goal is a 2500<br/>with couple of extra sound libraries and Hardware Protools. That<br/>should probably do everything I need. I&apos;m guessing this set up<br/>will set me back  $4000+-. I already have a dual 1Ghz Mac.</p><p>I&apos;m not really a trained instrumentalist however I understand<br/>theory pretty well and I figure the Kurtzweil plus Protools will<br/>allow me to cut and paste accurately enough to build what I have<br/>imagined. At least that&apos;s</p><p>A friend recommended a Proteus. I thought this might be a good<br/>interim machine for maybe $2-300 if I can find a good deal. After I<br/>get the Kurzweil it could be good for a couple of adittional<br/>sounds to compliment the Kurzweil.</p><p>Opinions here seemed to indicate the sound quality is inferior on<br/>the Proteus.</p><p>I&apos;m still thinking the Proteus might be a good fit.</p><p>My pal Brink McBride uses DX11s with moduals to do some<br/>really interesting music in unusual tuning modes (TX81Zs I&apos;m<br/>assuming at this time.) How hard are they to tune in relation to<br/>the Kurzweil? Flexabilty? Prices?</p><p>Any other suggestions or comments?</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2003 12:15:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;doren &quot; &lt;cordedpoodle42@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Any other suggestions or comments?</p><p>hi doren (garcia, right?). while you *should* be receiving helpful<br/>advice on this list at some point, right now it seems that these very<br/>sorts of questions are being discussed much more on the<br/>makemicromusic list (also on yahoogroups). check it out!</p></div><h3>doren &#x3C;cordedpoodle42@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2003 10:53:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes Paul,</p><p>It seems we&apos;ve met before.
