He often may have<br/>chosen a key AFTER the inspiration of a melody.  Although a piece was written in C<br/>major, it could only be transposed to C# major if the counterpoint of the<br/>already written composition worked within a more Pythagorean framework than a<br/>meantone framework.</p><p>Basically, the transposition gave new life and expression in the C# major key.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>In a message dated 10/6/2005 3:56:52 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>His mode of composing in Cmaj and then shifting<br/>the piece to C#maj needed a temperament that was able to cope with<br/>this shift, without him thinking about C#maj tone relationships.<br/>Michael</p></div><h3>Michael Zapf &#x3C;zapfzapfzapf@yahoo.de&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 12:19:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;JS Bach composed out of his head, not at a keyboard.<br/>He often may have chosen a key AFTER the inspiration<br/>of a melody.&gt;</p><p>Huh?
