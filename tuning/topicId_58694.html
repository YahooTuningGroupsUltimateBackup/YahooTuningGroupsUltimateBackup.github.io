To a first approximation, at least, a<br/>string of two thicknesses models a conical one.  Or you could take<br/>fine wire and wind it ON to a standard wire-wound string, to<br/>increase its thickness differentially ...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>   From: Mats &iuml;&iquest;&half;ljare &lt;oljare@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Conical strings?</p><p>Whether or not you understand the difference between conical and<br/>cylindrical bore for a pipe, that&apos;s what i was thinking about when i<br/>considered the idea of a conical string.
