As I said before, using sine waves the 5/6 is the narrowest &quot;allowable&quot; interval, whether a dyad or as part of a six note chord. The 15/14 (in this case a note, not an interval) however can be used in plenty of other chords that don&apos;t contain 1/1.(e.g 15/14, 3/2, 15/7, 3/1.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;Pardon my impatience (though I&apos;m sure I could find this out by reading your book for a long enough period of time...but what exactly would makes 1/1 and 2/1 have the &quot;same strength&quot;?&quot;</p><p>In 12TET 1/1 and 2/1 *have* the same strength but if you are choosing 12 perfectly just (relative to each other) notes for a scale you will always have to choose between 1/1 or 2/1 as the strongest tonic, unless you use the square root of 2 for the tritone but this wouldn&apos;t be &apos;just&apos;. This is explained in chapter 7 of my book (have you read it yet?)</p><p>Here&apos;s a funny coincidence I came across today. The &quot;ideal&quot; harmonic series has frequencies: x, 2x, 3x, 4x etc. and the amplitudes are y, y/2, y/3, y/4 etc.</p><p>If you treat the harmonic series as a chord then perhaps the &apos;overall&apos; strength of each harmonic is greater than the initial strength (e.g. the third harmonic on its own has an &apos;initial&apos; strength of 0.3333). But when you pair it with all the other harmonics (say the first sixteen), using my formula, then the &apos;overall&apos; value of the third harmonic should be greater than 0.3333.</p><p>First Harmonic... each pairning is (1/x + 1/y - diss(x/y))/2f<br/>(x&lt;y and the ratios are *not* simplified). &apos;f&apos; is the number of the higher harmonic and is a &apos;weight&apos; (i.e. the strength of each pairing is only as strong as the quieter element of the pair).<br/>If x/y&lt;=0.9375 then diss(x/y) = x/y. Else diss=(1 - x/y)*15.</p><p>1 + (1/1 + 1/2 - 1/2)/2f +<br/>    (1/1 + 1/3 - 1/3)/2f +<br/>    (1/1 + 1/4 - 1/4)/2f + etc to infinity</p><p>Third Harmonic...</p><p>0.3333 + (1/1 + 1/3 - 1/3)/2f +<br/>         (1/2 + 1/3 - 2/3)/2f +<br/>         (1/3 + 1/4 - 3/4)/2f + etc to infinity</p><p>If you work out the overall value of the first harmonic then it has no limit, it (slowly) approaches infinity. I suspect they all do. However the strength value of how the, say, first harmonic relates to the, say, third harmonic tends toward a finite limit. In other words if the first harmonic has an overall strength of 1, then (after a zillion iterations) the second harmonic approaches 0.5, the third approaches 0.3333, the fourth approached 0.25 etc. This is probably a tautology but it says a lot for my formula:<br/>(1/x + 1/y - diss(x/y))</p><p>So the next step is to write a program (using, say, the first sixteen harmonics of each note in an interval) that works out the consonance values of &quot;ideal&quot; intervals, using my formulas and &apos;weighting&apos; each calculation according to the strength value of the weaker &apos;element&apos; in each pair. If this approach is right then we&apos;ll have a &apos;rough guide&apos; to consonance for instruments whose timbres are close to the &apos;ideal&apos;.</p><p>Again, take a look at chapters 4, 6, 7, 10 and 11 of my book.</p><p>John.</p><p>PS Doty possibly meant to say &apos;bowed&apos; strings instead of &apos;plucked&apos; strings.</p></div>
