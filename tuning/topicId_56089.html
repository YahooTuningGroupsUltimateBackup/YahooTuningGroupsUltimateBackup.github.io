For a better understanding: The MMA<br/>(Midi Manufacturers Ass.) proposes MIDI data formats, but<br/>the MIDI instruments haven&apos;t to follow all these proposals.</p><p>There exist the following &quot;Real Time&quot; MIDI tuning data messages:</p><p>1. MIDI Single Note Tuning Real Time.<br/>With this data format every MIDI note may be retuned separately<br/>to every frequency and in abstract with a fineness of two bytes.<br/>This means 16,384 steps per halftone.Everyone of the 128 MIDI notes<br/>can be tuned separately to every frequency of the complete MIDI<br/>frequency range. This is a very fine tool for experimental<br/>tuning. The shortcoming is: Retuning requires very long data<br/>messages and therefore the support of quick changing tuning messages<br/>may cause timing problems.</p><p>2. MIDI Scale Octave Tuning Real Time One Byte Format.<br/>Controls the tuning with one byte steps (128 steps per<br/>halftone from -64 to + 63 Cents) per halftone.<br/>Controls all octave identic notes in the same way, for instance<br/>all notes &quot;C&quot; to a tuning deviation of + 4 Cents from E.T.<br/>Besides, it requires only one message for all<br/>selected MIDI channels.<br/>It controls very quick and it is the best tool for normal<br/>(non-experimental)real time tuning programs i.e. Hermode Tuning.<br/>It is not suitable for Justonic, as Justonic requires<br/>a range of more than -64 / +63 Cents for the retuning range<br/>of every Halftone.</p><p>3. MIDI Scale Octave Tuning Real Time Two Byte Format.<br/>Controls the tuning with two byte steps (16,384 steps<br/>per halftone)<br/>Slower than the one byte format as the tuning messages<br/>will be longer. Required for Justonic tuning programs.</p><p>4. YAMAHA Real Time Tuning SysEx.<br/>A company-specific MIDI tuning data format. Every note of<br/>every MIDI channel requires a separate tuning message.<br/>Therefore it is too slow for modern tuning programs as every<br/>message requires about 10 ms.</p><p>5. Roland Master Scale Tuning.<br/>A company-specific MIDI tuning data format. Every MIDI channel<br/>requires a separate message and every message requires about<br/>14 ms. Therefore it is too slow as soon as one wants to control<br/>more than one or two MIDI channels.</p><p>Now the actual situation:</p><p>General MIDI 1 didn&apos;t require the support of any &quot;Real Time&quot;<br/>tuning message.<br/>General MIDI 2 requires MIDI Scale Octave Tuning but only in a<br/>&quot;Non Real Time&quot; version. &quot;Real Time&quot; is only recommended but not<br/>required. This means: Every MIDI instruments producer still is<br/>free to support Real Time.<br/>Yamaha Real Time Tuning SysEx is not supported by every Yamaha<br/>instrument.<br/>Roland Master Scale Tuning is not supported by every Roland MIDI<br/>instrument.<br/>I tried to get more precise informations by these companies, but the<br/>answers have been incomplete and unfriendly. Even in personal<br/>disussions. Frankly: I never found in this world such unkind persons<br/>as by some Japanese companies.<br/>But the Hotlines of these companies are friendly and sometimes helpful.<br/>The problem is: They don&apos;t possess all relevant informations.</p><p>I only know one hardware synth supporting both Tuning Datas:<br/>-MIDI Single Note Tuning Real Time.<br/>-MIDI Scale Octave Tuning Real Time One Byte Format.<br/>This is the VIRUS. It contents also Hermode Tuning,<br/>but only in one extreme version, including the natural septh.</p><p>Besides: The different tuning programs cannot be distinguished<br/>by the question which tuning datas will be exported. Every<br/>tuning program can export the tuning datas by different<br/>messages. (Pitch, Scale Octave Tuning, Single Note<br/>Tuning). The different tuning programs follows different<br/>frequency position philosphies. Mutabor and Justonic follow<br/>a &quot;group&quot; (in German: &quot;Pulk&quot;) idea. Hermode Tuning follows<br/>an Elastic Center Position idea. See the describtion on our<br/>websites.</p><p>Best:<br/>Werner</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can also try asking here about specific synths.
