I take the 5-limit, 12-tone rational tuning ratios and create a custom tuning in Scala. We leave the reference pitch at A=440Hz for now. This means I ain&apos;t touching the Freq button for the Base Frequency dialog.</p><p>Just press Input, paste the ratios from the note after 1/1 until 2/1 inclusive, press OK and Export synth tuning (eventually Save).</p><p>Fairly intuitive I think. Now I can use the custom patch with my DAW. Everything is working perfect and I can hear the slight difference between this and 12-ET, for the first chord (C major). I am also testing it with a Lissajous Oscilloscope and it looks fantastic!</p><p>Now I need a new tuning/patch for the other 3 chords. And I do not know how to change the tonal center in Scala.

If one tunes a standard synthesizer to a just scale in the key of A, and then plays a Bm chord, the intervals of this chord are too narrow, and either the B must be flattened or the D and F# must be sharpened. The choice is an aesthetic one. If the melodic priority is to keep a pure whole tone between an A note in an A chord followed by a B note in the B chord, then the tuning root for the second chord is B, and the other notes are sharpened. If, however, the melodic priority is to keep a pure fourth between a C# in the first chord and an F# in the second, then the tuning root of the second chord would be F#, and the B would be flattened. There are other harmonic considerations as well, and a correct system must allow for a manual selection of tuning root... &gt;&gt;</p><p>I hope the passage above explains what I&apos;m trying to find out.

Where did the new ratios came from, what is the mathematics behind it (adding/multiplying or substraction/inversion/division between some ratios and some other ratios)?</p><p>And how are the frequencies calculated? For example, in the scale below, we start with 256Hz for C=1/1 and so we get the other tones. This is because 256 is simply 1, taken 8 octaves higher. In this case, A is 432Hz. If we set A to 440, C and all other notes will change frequency values accordingly.</p><p>But how are frequencies calculated when we &quot;change the tonal center&quot;, even though I don&apos;t have to?

For example you can make a scale with both D (9/8 above C) and D- (10/9 above C), but you have to map them to different keys on a MIDI controller and actually choose which one to use. It doesn&apos;t do it automatically for you.</p><p>&gt; This can be seen in the Hz values in the columns above!

I can search about this myself, I&apos;m only curious what happens when root changes occur mid-stream: is the new value taken as the 1/1? If this is true, after changing keys a few times one might notice that frequency for a given note has changed, and by the end of the song the reference pitch will be another.

Composers wanted to be able to play every key implied on what the keyboard eventually evolved to, with 12 pitches per octave. And more specifically, it is perfectly permissable to modulate even with a non-tempered keyboard as long as you&apos;re willing to have different keys have different intervallic relationships. Baroque, classical, etc. composers wanted the 12 keyboard keys to sound the same intervals. That useful if, for example, you are playing an accompaniment for a singer (much, much more common in pre-record times than now) who cannot handle the pitch range of one given arrangement, and you need to transpose the arrangement to a different key, yet keep the arrangement with the same general flavor.</p></div><h3><a id=104788 href="#104788">ðŸ”—</a>Bogdan &#x3C;baros_ilogic@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2012 1:09:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ll try to refrase my initial question, having in mind what I learned since I first asked.</p><p>If A=440 Hz, and the distance from C (1/1) to A is 5/3, then the value of C in Hz will be equal with the difference between the two intervals. To subtract 5/3 from 1/1, we divide (cross multiply) the numbers: 1/1 &Atilde;&middot; 5/3 = 3/5. The process of &acirc;Â€Âœsubtraction&acirc;Â€&#x9D; is in fact one of division because of the logarithmic nature of the scale of pitch. So 440 * 3/5 = 264 Hz - the value of C. Now we know 1/1 and we can easy calculate the rest of our scale. G will be 264 * 3/2 = 396 Hz.</p><p>Now let&acirc;Â€Â™s make G=1/1. I take the first column (C=1/1) in Scala and use the Key command. Instead of degree 7 I will use degree 5. I do this so I can represent the G=1/1 scale in a C=1/1 scale with intervals that reflect this change. I am still searching for my words here, so let me try to put it in another way.</p><p>We now make G=1/1, while keeping the keyboard layout. First step is to change the root to G. This is column 2 below. Because the first note cannot be something different than 1/1, we resort the scale. This is column 3, and it&acirc;Â€Â™s done by substracting the new head of the list 4/3 from all other members. Finally, we do the octave equivalence calculations.</p><p>To get to this result directly from column 1 to column 3, we change the Key degree in Scala not by our Current Degree (CD) which is 7, but with 12-CD. 12-7=5. I&acirc;Â€Â™m not sure why I&acirc;Â€Â™m using this algorithm, Keenan pointed me in doing so.</p><p>(Maybe because The Key command divides every scale member by the value of the scale degree that you tell it. So, if you pick the scale degree that is 3/2, Key divides everything by 3/2, does the octave equivalence calcuations, and resorts the scale. But we see in the second column that the first ratio is 4/3, and in order to make it 1/1 we have to substract 4/3 from it and from the others. It turns out that 4/3 is scale degree #5, so maybe that&acirc;Â€Â™s why we use 5 instead of 7.)</p><p>C=1/1            G=1/1            G=1/1 expressed as C=1/1</p><p>1/1              4/3              1/1<br/>16/15            45/32            135/128<br/>9/8              3/2              9/8<br/>6/5              8/5              6/5<br/>5/4              5/3              5/4<br/>4/3              9/5              27/20<br/>45/32            15/8             45/32<br/>3/2              1/1              3/2<br/>8/5              16/15            8/5<br/>5/3              9/8              27/16<br/>9/5              6/5              9/5<br/>15/8             5/4              15/8</p><p>What happens with the base frequency when we make G=1/1? Which of the 2 options we choose:</p><p>a) We take the G value from the list with C=1/1, 396 Hz and calculate the rest of the notes (meaning that C=264 Hz is our reference), or</p><p>b) We take A=440 Hz as reference and calculate G, knowing that if G=1/1 then A=9/8 and using the same principle as described in the second paragraph, G will be 440 * 8/9 = 391,11 Hz and we can calculate the remaining notes using column 2 above. Conversely, we can use directly column 3 so if A=27/16 from C, then C will be 440 * 16/27 = 260,74 and from here we can find the other values.</p><p>I understood that if we change key while playing, we might end up by the end of the song with another reference pitch (due to 81/80, the syntonic comma).</p><p>So my question, and the reason for writing all this, is:</p><p>If I want to play music in the key of G, in JI, ussing the 3rd column of ratios, which of the options above I&acirc;Â€Â™m using, a) or b) ? If my song doesn&acirc;Â€Â™t change key and I start directly from G, which is the refference pitch? Is it A=440 &acirc;Â€&quot; the b) case, or is it A=445,5 &acirc;Â€&quot; the a) case ?</p></div>
