What you&apos;re doing does sound a lot<br/>like my field of interest.

Do you do 5-limit tuning, or do you go into higher limits, as, for<br/>     example, a 4:5:6:7 chord?</p><p>   . It sounds above as if you do (or plan on doing) both real-time<br/>     adaptive tuning, and what I call &quot;leisure&quot; tuning (with knowledge<br/>     of the entire piece, able to &quot;look forward&quot; in time); is this<br/>     correct?</p><p>As Paul has mentioned, I&apos;m at <a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a>.

My system is for representing tunings in a general way,<br/>in the way I think we really think about them, as networks of<br/>fuzzy intervals.  So, my system doesn&apos;t serch for optimal tunings the<br/>way yours does; it searches for optimal tunings for a given network<br/>of fuzzy intervals.  I suppose if you weighted every possible interval<br/>equally, and used standard dissonance curves for them, and masked<br/>these so that they could only fall in a certain range, then you&apos;d<br/>probably get similar results with my algorithm.</p><p>&gt;Shore, hope to have something intelligent to say when<br/>&gt;I read more in your paper.</p><p>I look forward to it!</p><p>-m</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=23013 href="#23013">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Saunders &#x3C;michaelsaunders7@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2001 2:23:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;My system is centered on the idea of:<br/>&gt;&gt;1.

(actually, I&apos;ve been lurking for more years than<br/>I can remember.)</p><p>&gt;   . Are you able to process existing MIDI files?</p><p>No (no desire to work with midi, really---I&apos;m a csounder).<br/>A little background:<br/>My system, Rusty, hasn&apos;t yet been coded (well, a little bit has);<br/>I&apos;ve been trying to find support to continue the research, trying<br/>to find a job, etc.  It&apos;s not specifically for tuning---it&apos;s for representing<br/>many different types of musical object in a very general, rigorous<br/>way---the short paper on my site gives a good 1.5 page overview<br/>of this.  Of course, objects like intervals, scales and tunings are<br/>a big part of the story.  So, the goal, for me, is to be able to<br/>_represent_ any imaginable instance of one of these objects (and<br/>to represent it in the computer in the same way we think of it).<br/>Also, the behavior of objects is important, so my scales know<br/>how to tune themselves.  Very roughly, it works like this:</p><p>-You define some intervals fuzzily (as a function of suitability<br/>(on [0,1]) vs. pitch distance.  This curve can have any shape at<br/>all, perhaps representing your opinion about what a given interval<br/>is or some objectively-generated dissonance curve.  Generally<br/>speaking, if you have a peak in the graph, that means that the<br/>location of the peak is a suitable instance of the interval you&apos;re<br/>defining. The width of the peak relates to how far you&apos;re willing<br/>to temper it---the suitability drops off as you move away from the<br/>peak.</p><p>-You have a scale (i.e., an indexing system) you want to use.</p><p>-You define a tuning by connecting some of the scalar degrees with<br/>fuzzy intervals.  You need only define the intervals that are<br/>important to you, and you can weight them according to importance.</p><p>-Then, my algorithm finds the optimal tuning (absolute pitches)<br/>_given_the_user_definitions_.  The resulting scale is correct in<br/>the sense that it&apos;s exactly what the user defined. In a nutshell,<br/>the algorithm works like this:  it finds all the pathways through<br/>defined-intervals between an anchor (a degree with a defined<br/>fixed pitch) and the degree being tuned.  It adds the fuzzy intervals<br/>on each pathway together by convolution (i.e., adding their<br/>abscissae).  It takes all of these (possibly conflicting) pathways<br/>and combines them together by multiplication, generating a<br/>curve of suitability vs. pitch for that degree. This is defuzzified by<br/>finding the median of the maxima (the shape of the curve may<br/>be interesting too).</p><p>And that&apos;s how I think we thing about tunings, deep-down, in<br/>a very prcatical way.</p><p>&gt;   . How do/would you handle a chain of fifths chord, ex. C-G-D-A, where<br/>&gt;     the fifths and the minor third conflict?</p><p>I&apos;m not tied to any particular scale or interval definitions, so it<br/>depends on how you define it.  Let&apos;s say each of the possible intervals<br/>gets a definition of a Gaussian curve peaking at:<br/>CG---3/2&#x9;&#x9;GD---3/2<br/>CD---9/8&#x9;&#x9;GA---9/8<br/>CA---5/3&#x9;&#x9;DA---3/2<br/>with widths representing how far I think each can be tempered.<br/>Then I throw it to the algorithm and let the computer worry<br/>about it---I&apos;ll get the optimal compromise according to my definitions.</p><p>&gt;   . What about augmented triads and full diminished tetrads?</p><p>A similar story. You define what you mean by &quot;maj/min third&quot;<br/>and &quot;octave&quot; using fuzzy intervals, then let the algorithm make<br/>the compromise.  Maybe you might like to make the interval<br/>definitions based on dissonance curves, for example.</p><p>&gt;   . How do/would you handle the &quot;comma pump&quot; sequence: Cmaj, Amin,<br/>&gt;     Dmin, Gmaj, Cmaj, which tends to impose downward drift on the<br/>&gt;     tuning?</p><p>Drift is a big issue!  My adaptive algorithm is in there. (I called my<br/>fixed and adaptive systems &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot; in the thesis,<br/>since the term &quot;adaptive wasn&apos;t in use (or at least wasn&apos;t widespread)<br/>when I wrote it.)  It&apos;s something like 30 pages long, but roughly:<br/>I process the score to determine to what degree (in a fuzzy sense)<br/>each scalar degree is present at a given time, according to lots of<br/>parameters about things that affect memory, etc. (there are several<br/>ways notes can &quot;persist&quot;).  Then the score is broken up into a series of<br/>&quot;harmonic contexts&quot;---sections when the same set of degrees is sounding<br/>---according to a lot of rules.  Then it&apos;s a matter of anchoring each<br/>context to a &quot;fiducial&quot; note.  There are several categories of candidates<br/>and the rules are quite Byzantine but, I think, rational---and controllable<br/>with many parameters. Drift is a big issue in this.  Then, my stable<br/>tuning algorithm operates within this structure to tune notes only in<br/>reference to what is sounding and the degree to which it is sounding.<br/>There are versions where the pitches of notes are nominally constant<br/>and where they are allowed to vary with time to improve the intonation.<br/>I think it&apos;s quite general and covers everything---everything I could<br/>think of anyway.</p><p>&gt;   . Do you do 5-limit tuning, or do you go into higher limits, as, for<br/>&gt;     example, a 4:5:6:7 chord?</p><p>It&apos;s all a matter of what the user defines.</p><p>&gt;   . It sounds above as if you do (or plan on doing) both real-time<br/>&gt;     adaptive tuning, and what I call &quot;leisure&quot; tuning (with knowledge<br/>&gt;     of the entire piece, able to &quot;look forward&quot; in time); is this<br/>&gt;     correct?</p><p>Yes, though I&apos;m no fan of real-time, I designed the algorithms so<br/>they never _require_ future information, though they can take<br/>advantage of it (you&apos;ll notice in the handling of drift, there&apos;s no<br/>bais towards forward/backward, for example).</p><p>&gt;As Paul has mentioned, I&apos;m at <a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a>.
