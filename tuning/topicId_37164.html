It&apos;s something I plan to personally<br/>explore in depth at a future time. It&apos;s also something that<br/>apparently has never been mentioned on the Tuning list, and the<br/>more you listen, you may begin to wonder why.</p><p>Here&apos;s an offhand link to a page (with mp3s) about one of the<br/>best Fado singers around, Cristina Branco.</p><p>&quot;About Cristina Branco&quot; (Nederlandse taal)<br/><a href="http://www.melomusic.nl/cb_ain.htm">http://www.melomusic.nl/cb_ain.htm</a></p><p>This page is in Dutch, and for everyone other than Manuel (&amp;<br/>other Dutch speakers here), there are links on that page to<br/>articles about her in English, Portuguese, &amp; Dutch. This<br/>particular page has links to mp3s at the bottom. In popular<br/>(commercial) media it&apos;s too often conveniently labeled as<br/>&quot;Portuguese Blues&quot;, but while I love American Blues music, this<br/>is another world.</p><p>I&apos;ll try &amp; track down some more pages in English about the Fado.</p><p>Tchau,<br/>Joel</p></div>
