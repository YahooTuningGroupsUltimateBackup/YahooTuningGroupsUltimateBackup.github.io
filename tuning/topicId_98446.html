I guess as per Carl&apos;s last message the normal basis<br/>for the temperament is 81/80, 126/125, which is equivalent to stating<br/>that it&apos;s 81/80 and 225/224, and should also be equivalent to the<br/>commas you listed in your last message as well.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This brings me to another point, though, that I&apos;ve been thinking much<br/>&gt; &gt; about - this is another MOS of meantone, really.

So what&apos;s the deal?</p><p>You have to map them as 2.3.5.7.9&apos; temperaments, where 9 is read &quot;9<br/>prime.&quot; That is, there end up being two mappings for 9 - the direct,<br/>&quot;prime&quot; 9, which you should use in chords like 8:9:10:11 or something,<br/>and then the composite 9, which you should use things like major 9<br/>chords (or just use your discretion in general). 25-EDO doesn&apos;t<br/>eliminate 81/80, but it eliminates 81&apos;/80. So when you say that 10/9<br/>is the generator, you actually mean 10/9&apos;, because in 25-EDO the<br/>actual 10/9 you&apos;d get by mapping 3 and 5 and going from there isn&apos;t<br/>the one you&apos;re talking about.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A similarly awesome scale occurs if you use double the<br/>&gt; &gt; generator in porcupine, which is a minor third, three of which get you<br/>&gt; &gt; to 16/9 or 7/4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t that &quot;amity&quot; or something?</p><p>If three of them get you to 16/9, that&apos;s just normal porcupine,<br/>because the comma that ends up vanishing is 250/243. You just end up<br/>with the 2.5.9 version of porcupine, similar to how your temperament<br/>gets you to the 2.5.9 version of meantone. But the resulting 3L4s<br/>scale is awesome - it sounds like diminished[8], except cut off at 7<br/>notes. It&apos;s basically the same thing as kleismic[7], but if you&apos;re in<br/>porcupine temperament then there&apos;s one 4:7:9:11 chord in the scale, so<br/>playing the mode where that&apos;s the root makes the whole thing sound<br/>&quot;otonal&quot; and badass in general.</p><p>If we&apos;re saying that three of them get you to 7/4, then 875/864<br/>vanishes, and you&apos;re in a rank-3 temperament apparently called<br/>&quot;supermagic,&quot; and one of its rank-2 children is porcupine.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2011 7:37:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Bohlen&apos;s.
