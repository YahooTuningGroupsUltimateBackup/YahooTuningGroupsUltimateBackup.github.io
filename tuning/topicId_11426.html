Incidentally, another review has come out that stated my bassoon intonation was most in affinity with Ornette.  All I did was to distort the intonation in the manner I heard and received from Ornette.</p><p>John Coltrane - surely in the multiphonic treatment</p><p>Miles Davis - in the modal sense, bluesy</p><p>Don Ellis - in quartertone harmonies and melodies, outfitted his big band with quartertone valved brass and fingering charts for the saxophones</p><p>Charles Mingus - idiosyncratic interval get special attention, mainly as an ear-catcher, or hook (just my opinion)</p><p>Why not include Eric Dolfy? - he could at least play actual microtones of all kinds with fingerings on a multiplicity of winds.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=11437 href="#11437">ðŸ”—</a>Bob Valentine &#x3C;bval@internet-zahav.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2000 1:53:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi folks,</p><p>That was an accidental sending to the list on my part. I<br/>sent it as a private email to the &quot;jazz guitar buleting<br/>board&quot; poster.</p><p>I believe that &apos;blues&apos; has plenty of microtonalism, and<br/>that that part of jazz which is blues influenced (a lot)<br/>will use the same microtonalism. Whether this<br/>approximates other tuning systems (septimal and/or<br/>other just intervals) or is just exploring a pallette of<br/>&apos;sharper and flatter intervals&apos; in whatever temperment<br/>horn players are actually using is a different topic.</p><p>Yes, I should have mentioned Jon Catler and Neil<br/>Haverstick to him (I suppose also Steve Vai with<br/>his 15 and 16 tet guitars).</p><p>Johnny, I just read &quot;Ornette : A Harmolodic Life&quot; and<br/>I envy your experience playing with the man. In the<br/>book they go into some of his experience with playing<br/>with untempered instrumentalists in Africa, which<br/>seemed to have a big effect on him. But the way he<br/>thinks about music seems a little removed from the<br/>&apos;precision&apos; some of the tuning list approach the<br/>subject.</p><p>I&apos;ve been in lurk mode for awhile, basically with some<br/>mail/computer issues but hope to start reading and<br/>(maybe) contributing again.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=11480 href="#11480">ðŸ”—</a>James C.
