But it kept me alert and fresh, and<br/>feeling energized.  Usually I get sleepy and mesmerized after about 2<br/>hours of driving.  Maybe it&apos;s the fact that the music is so unique<br/>and interesting, or maybe it&apos;s the every changing rhythm patterns.<br/>Might even have something to do with the sort of angularity of those<br/>RI tunings!  It&apos;s definitely a top notch record from end to end, at<br/>any rate.  Stays near the front of my CD case.</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ligon/CD_Galunlati.htm">http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ligon/CD_Galunlati.htm</a></p><p>David</p></div>
