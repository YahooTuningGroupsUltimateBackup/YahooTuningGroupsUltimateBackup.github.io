One reason that I have been a bit slow responding is that I was<br/>&gt; taken aback when someone (sorry I forget who) said that I was wrong and<br/>&gt; that chaos frequency doubling does add lower frequencies.  Now that I<br/>&gt; think about it the mathematical cases of chaos do in fact do that, so I<br/>&gt; was wrong to say that was not so.  However I will have another go at<br/>&gt; putting my foot in it and say that I think that real world, continuous<br/>&gt; systems do show frequency doubling and not frequency halving behaviours<br/>&gt; - which is presumably why they call it frequency doubling.<br/>&gt;<br/>I&apos;m not sure what you are referring to, but I thought Paul E. was talking<br/>about period doubling behavior (therefore frequency halving). Certainly<br/>coutinuous chaotic systems exhibit period doubling and period halving<br/>depending on the way the parameter is being twiddled. I had a neat paper,<br/>which of course I cannot now locate, using template analysis on vocalized<br/>vowels to exhibit natural strange attractors in normal speech. If ordinary<br/>vowels are strange attractors of the vocal chords, then controlling a<br/>period two imbedded in the attractor would result in a true subharmonic.<br/>Is it possible that throat singers use this technique?<br/>&gt; &gt;I would like to make a recording of this phenomenon and send it to whomever on this list<br/>&gt; &gt;is interested in listening to it, analyzing, etc.  I guess cassette is the easiest for me<br/>&gt; &gt;to make.  I am really interested to get your feedback on these sounds - any takers?<br/>I would love to have such a recording. Is it possible to send me a wave<br/>file as an attachment?<br/>&gt; Yes please.  I am in New Zealand, so sending a WAV file might be<br/>&gt; easiest, but if you want to use post my address is:<br/>&gt; Ray Tomes, 59 Maritime Tce, Birkenhead, Auckland, New Zealand.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p></div>
