It is a strict interval canon in the Bohlen-Pierce scale, and i uploaded the unretuned Midi files to the Files section here, however i had some problems with Scala as i tried to render it to a retuned Midi file, and for some reason it will only render it to a single channel Midi which sounds absolutely terrible. However realtime playback still works, and i made a video version you can listen to here:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyriBnnDcKE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyriBnnDcKE</a></p><p>Also, i uploaded a &quot;video&quot; of some earlier Midi compositions most here have heard already:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrRr2lAWmGs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrRr2lAWmGs</a></p><p>/Mats &Ouml;ljare</p></div>
