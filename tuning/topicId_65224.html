What purpose shall it serve other than<br/>complicate our understanding of music theory? It&apos;s already very much<br/>engrossed with needless detail:</p><p><a href="http://www.smu.edu/totw/tonicize.htm">http://www.smu.edu/totw/tonicize.htm</a><br/><a href="http://courses.wcupa.edu/abauer/mtm.html">http://courses.wcupa.edu/abauer/mtm.html</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicization</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There is no mention of anything such as &grave;tonal transposition&grave; here, nor<br/>&gt; &gt; anywhere else I could readily reach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More often than with transposition, it is used with more specific<br/>&gt; instances like imitations, sequences and fugue subjects. They are either<br/>&gt; real transpositions, interval for interval, which constitute a new<br/>&gt; tonality, or tonal. These latter ones stay inside the established<br/>&gt; tonality for the price of exchanging major and minor intervals, fifths<br/>&gt; and fourths.<br/>&gt;</p><p>But that is nothing other than an instance of modulation, be it intermediate<br/>or tonicizing...</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Modulation in the Western sense! Now that is something to be explained<br/>aside<br/>&gt; &gt; from modulation in an intercontinental/universal sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Western modulation means establishing a key, and the only Western way to<br/>&gt; establish a key is with IV-V-I or II-V-I cadence, and then establishing<br/>&gt; a different key by the same means.</p><p>Certainly not. There are several Western ways to establish keys. It will<br/>just be too long to give an account of them here. Suffice it to say, in my<br/>Golden Horn Shipyard Concerto, 1st movement toward the end, I modulate from<br/>the key of C minor to D major like this:</p><p>Cm root &gt; BM root &gt; Eb minor 1st inv &gt; FM dom 7th root &gt; ditto 3rd inv &gt; DM<br/>root</p><p>This is the first measure with a time signature of 11/8. Listen onward from<br/>2:06 seconds. The second measure goes to G major thus:</p><p>DM root to Dm root &gt; Bbm 1st inv to root &gt; F minor 1st inv to AbM dom. jazzy<br/>and back &gt; GM root &gt; back to Cm root.</p><p>And I have not even established a new key yet.</p><p>Now I&apos;m sure it is possible for someone to jump in and cry, but these are<br/>tonicizations!</p><p>So what? They all classify as modulations, be they intermediate, transient,<br/>tonicizing, common tone, altered chord, sequential, direct or enharmonical.</p><p>(Goodness! How I hate these details.)</p><p>Hackneyed example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take a march in, say, F. There is an introduction, a high register<br/>&gt; melodic strain (repeated), a strain of broken chords in the low register<br/>&gt; (repeated), and then it&apos;s time for the trio, which will normally be in<br/>&gt; Bb. Instead of simply continuing in the other key (&quot;gear shift&quot; I think<br/>&gt; it&apos;s called in English) there are two extra bars where the tuba goes<br/>&gt; F-Eb-D-C. The F (plus five other tones) is common to F and Bb major and<br/>&gt; is ambiguous. The Eb is foreign to F and tells you that a modulation may<br/>&gt; be going on. As it happens, the next 1, first chord in the trio, is Bb;<br/>&gt; there really was a modulation. Without the two bars of preparation, you<br/>&gt; have a key change, but no modulation (this is not supposed to happen in<br/>&gt; classical music). Without the concluding Bb, your tonality is not<br/>&gt; established and you have to wait for the modulation to be completed<br/>&gt; (which, post-Satie, may never happen).</p><p>To be completed is the word.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Gregorian chant, modulation occurs (1) when a piece exceeds the<br/>&gt; octave (going from authentic to plagal or the other way around), (2)<br/>&gt; starts in D, but suddenly ends a number of phrases in E, or (3) uses an<br/>&gt; unusual repercussa (tenor, dominant), but (not 4) not when the authentic<br/>&gt; D-mode switches between B and Bb to avoid a mi-contra-fa (it is not<br/>&gt; known if this happened in monophonic music; it does in early polyphony).<br/>&gt; There may be more possibilities to use that term.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These two kinds of modulations have nothing to do with each other, and<br/>&gt; it is probably common to refer to the chant kind of modulation by an<br/>&gt; original latin term like modulatio or modus mixtus.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This only serves to complicate matters.</p><p>&gt; It is conceivable that a piece in a D-mode introduces an Eb o an F#.<br/>&gt; Your kanun sample had a lot of this, but I am not aware that it happens<br/>&gt; in Gregorian chant. Now if you want to talk about Western polyphony and<br/>&gt; Gregorian chant, you can refer to &quot;molation&quot;</p><p>Never heard of it.</p><p>and &quot;modulatio&quot;. If you<br/>&gt; want to talk about makam music</p><p>Capitals please. Maqam Music.</p><p>and Western polyphony, you can use<br/>&gt; &quot;modulation&quot; and &quot;mixed modes&quot;. What if you want to compare the moddal<br/>&gt; concepts of makam and Gregorian chant? Best to use, and teach us, the<br/>&gt; term used within the makam tradition, all along, and nothing universal,<br/>&gt; please.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I will insist on wrenching out of your hands the beautifying latin words<br/>which you so wish to attribute to Western tradition alone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t want to join in again.<br/>&gt; klaus<br/>&gt;</p><p>Neither.<br/>Oz.</p></div>
