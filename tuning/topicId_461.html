You<br/>would have to have this because<br/>&gt;if you allowed the chain to be interrupted you could say that even<br/>though you have a 7/6 and an 7/4 in a &gt;scale they are a 3/2 apart (this<br/>being a partial chain) but<br/>&gt;sooner or later you have to examine it relation to a 5/4 or 1/1. It is<br/>if the simplest latticing of a scale &gt;would determine a limit.</p><p>I am very interested in what you are saying here, so if you could try to<br/>be more clear, with a few examples, etc., I&apos;d be delighted. I think my<br/>response to Paul Hahn explained my view on this, but maybe there are<br/>finer points we can get into here.</p></div><h3><a id=481 href="#481">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Clearly the inclusive<br/>sense is more appropriate and Partch coined the term &quot;ratio of N&quot; for<br/>the exclusive case. However, it would be nice to have a noun which<br/>refers to a property of a ratio, that of belonging to the set of ratios<br/>of N, to prevent the language from becoming extremely awkward (as it<br/>would if one tried to rewrite Gary&apos;s post using the &quot;ratio of N&quot;<br/>terminology). Is that where you&apos;re proposing the word &quot;Cap&quot;? In other<br/>words, the odd-Cap of a ratio would be the higher of the highest odd<br/>factor of the numerator and the highest odd factor of the denominator?<br/>If so, then the n-limit includes all ratios whose Cap is less than or<br/>equal to N.</p><p>I have a feeling this is not what you meant, but it would still be<br/>useful to have such a noun. Can anyone think of a term that would convey<br/>this meaning more simply than &quot;belonging to the set of ratios of N&quot;?</p></div><h3><a id=4543 href="#4543">ðŸ”—</a>perlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</h3><span>8/28/1999 9:56:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; No one knows<br/>&gt;&gt; what ancient Greek music sounded like, certainly not subcommatic variations<br/>&gt;&gt; within the scale.

I was pointing out that sruti #2, whether tuned 16/15,<br/>135/128, or somewhere in-between, would be dissonant against the drone and<br/>not directly tunable to the drone by ear.</p><p>&gt;I cannot comment about Hindustani music, but I have measured many a<br/>&gt;(Karnatic) vina fret, and they tend to be tuned rather than tempered, a<br/>&gt;finding in contradiction to Erlich&apos;s. Where one of the 12 frets has to<br/>cover<br/>&gt;more than one distinct pitch, one of the two is chosen, and the other is<br/>&gt;reached by bending.</p><p>Daniel, at most only one fret, sruti #2, would have to be tempered. This was<br/>in the days when sa-grama and ma-grama were both in use.
