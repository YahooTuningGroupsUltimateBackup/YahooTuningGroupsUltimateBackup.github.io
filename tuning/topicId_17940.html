Sethares has done a pretty good job in his book -- take a close look<br/>at <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html</a><br/>&lt;<a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html</a>&gt; . The essential concept<br/>you need to familiarize yourself with is the _critical band_ -- let me know<br/>if you can &quot;get it&quot; from this website. Now, Sethares gives some formulae for<br/>calculating the total dissonance of any set of partials. I tried<br/>implementing these formulae in conjunction with some sound files I was<br/>making and got some mighty strange results. So I contacted Sethares. First<br/>of all, it turns out that &quot;amplitude&quot; in his formulae is not meant to me<br/>amplitude at all but instead _loudness_ measured in dB. Secondly, there were<br/>some antinomies and ambiguities that come up in trying to use a theoretical<br/>set of dB levels for a given timbre in this formula . . . and Sethares never<br/>got back to me with a satisfactory solution.</p><p>So I would say: Read and absorb Sethares&apos;s work, familiarize yourself with<br/>his formulae and the critical band concept, and then run a few tests to make<br/>sure you have something that makes sense -- don&apos;t take accept the numbers<br/>blindly! Finally, keep in mind that, let alone combination tones, there&apos;s a<br/>whole other component of dissonance which Sethares doesn&apos;t take into account<br/>-- see Parncutt&apos;s _Harmony -- A Psychoacoustical Approach_, or my harmonic<br/>entropy work, for an explanation.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2001 11:31:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&gt; Well the thing is we perceive timbre more by the timing of the attacks than<br/>&gt; anything else -- so it would be hard to acheive this in a strictly<br/>&gt; human-controlled performance unless long sustained tones were used.

A very small change in the shape of a<br/>gong or a metallophone can alter the proportions of the partials<br/>dramtically.  While one can detect some broadly-drawn spectral patterns<br/>which distinguish the various instrumental types (and distinctiveness is<br/>essential to the orchestration style: witness Widyanto&apos;s complaint that Lou<br/>Harrison&apos;s aluminum instruments all sounded the same), envelope is a<br/>co-decisive elements here.  The more I play and sing Javanese music, the<br/>more I am persuaded that it is the very presence of such a variety of<br/>spectra within single instrumental classes that has made it possible for<br/>listeners to accept such wide temperings (and gamelan tunings are indeed<br/>temperaments, intended to represent three or more tonal transpositions of a<br/>model scale with a limited set of fixed pitches).</p><p>To this persuasion, one caveat must be added, and that is that ensembles do<br/>exist in Java and Sunda which are mostly or exclusively composed of<br/>instruments with harmonic spectra. The players in these ensembles have no<br/>difficulty in tuning away from simple just intervals (e.g. van Zanten&apos;s<br/>study of Cianjuran showed a preference for major thirds around 100 cents).<br/>But, again, there is some evidence that players are trying to &quot;cover up&quot;<br/>these distances from harmonic series intervals:  flute and rebab players as<br/>well as singers use vibrato, and in Javanese citeran, courses are often<br/>tuned to only loosely approximate unisons.</p><p>To be complete, I should note that there is an informal, non-systematic, use<br/>of &quot;mistuned unisons&quot; between instruments in Java. This increases volume and<br/>creates a vibrato on the vox humana principle; whether this vibrato is a<br/>desired timbre is difficult to assess, in any case it does provide an<br/>additional degree of the above mentioned intonation cover.  It is in Bali<br/>that one finds a systematic use of this principle.  I&apos;m less qualified to<br/>write about this, but (c.f. Michael Tenzer&apos;s new and excellent study on<br/>Kebyar) the idea is to have a fixed rate of beating throughout the ensemble.<br/>This is obviously a tricky thing to achieve with limited technical means,<br/>but perhaps the diversity of spectral proportions allows considerable<br/>lattitude.  However, with cscound or acid wave or mathematica, it&apos;s an easy<br/>task to simulate this environment.  With two instruments tuned within the<br/>critical band, the apparent pitch is the average. Project a given scale<br/>throughout all the registers, and then assign two instruments to each tone,<br/>differing from one another by a constant number of hertz, whose average<br/>fundamental is equal to the desired pitch.  (There -- I gave away my current<br/>project!)</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
