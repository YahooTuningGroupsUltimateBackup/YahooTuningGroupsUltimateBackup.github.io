The<br/>&gt;only other possibility would have been UCSD, but his time spent there was<br/>&gt;short and he hated the place with a passion.</p><p>Harry was shown the ARP 2500 in Honolulu in 1974 by Peter Corragio.

I would not give the photo too much importance, however: his<br/>contemporary statements in _Genesis_ about harmoniums are much more<br/>convincing. He was well aware of the activities at the San Francisco Tape<br/>Center, and at the electronic studios at UCSD and San Diego State. Had he<br/>been really more serious about the development of electronic instruments he<br/>would have certainly pursued the matter more seriously.</p><p>If anyonw is in doubt about the musicality of the harmonium, they should<br/>really listen to some of the original ensemble repertoire with harmonium --<br/>the Petite Messe Solemnele of Rossini, the J.Strauss and Mahler<br/>arrangements of the Schoenberg School, Schoenberg&apos;s own _Herzgewa&quot;chse_,<br/>etc.. Rainer Riehn&apos;s recent chamber arrangement of Mahler&apos;s _Das Lied von<br/>der Erde_ is absolutely stunning.</p><p>A statement to the effect that Partch would have approved of or used a DX7<br/>is an unprovable conjecture and strikes me as implausible. Beyond the fact<br/>-- to paraphrase Stravinsy -- that the &apos;damned things don&apos;t breath&apos; I think<br/>Partch would have rejected the DX7 out of hand solely on the basis of the<br/>impossibility of fine-tuning the instrument by removing beats. Partch&apos;s<br/>instrumentation, for all the faults, became an essential aspect of his<br/>work, and a performance on instruments other than his own had better be a<br/>convincing one. The instruments built by Cris Forster were a step in the<br/>right direction, being very well crafted instruments usable in the Partch<br/>repertoire, but the arrangements I have heard for other instruments (i.e.<br/>Kronos, Newband) fail to make musically convincing cases for such<br/>substitutions.</p><p>I take the same position with regard to other historical musics -- if the<br/>original instrumentation, or something close to it, is available, any<br/>substitution had better deliver a convincing rationale. For example, Glenn<br/>Gould made a singular case for use of a modern -- albeit drastically<br/>revoiced -- piano for Byrd or Bach, but did so with a considerable<br/>innovation in style that depended upon his equally singular technique.<br/>However, in general, a Viennese _Liederabend_ with anything other than a<br/>Bo&quot;sendorfer or an older Beckstein is hard to take and with a big Steinway,<br/>a good reason to walk out well before the fat person begins to sing.</p></div><h3>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@IDT.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/1999 5:17:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel is right about the DX7 and the beats.  That&apos;s why the AFMM has<br/>never used the DX7 in its performance, but rather a Proteus synthesizer.<br/>This resolves that problem.</p><p>The fact that Partch didn&apos;t like the scalatron should not weigh heavily<br/>when practically _no_ composers liked its sound enough to compose for it.</p><p>As for playing instruments that grunt and squeal, gee, I guess the bassoon<br/>and the harmonium are similar in this respect.  You certainly can hear the<br/>keys on the bassoon when playing.  It is rare that a composer really<br/>understands how to write for the instrument.  Luckily some of the great<br/>composers were able to do it justice (e.g. Tchaikovsky, Mozart,<br/>Beethoven, Stravinsky).</p><p>Somehow, the replacement of the chromelodeon with an electronic tone -- a<br/>beautiful electronic tone -- works well with both Partch&apos;s historical<br/>comments and with performance practice.  I&apos;ve mentioned earlier about how<br/>the chromelodeon lacked the dexterity to play fast notes (like in Y.D.<br/>Fantasy) and might benefit from the technical freedoms that the<br/>synthesizers allow.</p><p>Much more egregious to my sensibilities is the vocalizing of Partch&apos;s<br/>music with wide vibrati.  I had thought Partch very<br/>clear on the kind of voice he sought, and yet the Partch choir resonates<br/>with support for the opera standard.</p><p>Fact: I don&apos;t care for Bach on piano, much preferring various other<br/>keyboards. Fact: it is not the same case for<br/>Bach as for Partch in terms of why the concerts are performed in the<br/>first place.  Fact: Partch must be seen in historical context, like<br/>any composer.  Fact: it has only recently been unearthed by Bob Gilmore<br/>that in 1950 Partch wrote that the chromelodeon was<br/>unmusical for him and he succeeeded in acquiring funds to research and<br/>hopefully build an acceptable electronic tone instrument.  Fact: he was<br/>too early in history to succeed in using an electronic instrument for his<br/>purposes.  Fact, Partch amplified his guitars and his Kithara.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music&#x9;<br/>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br/>New York, New York  10021  USA<br/>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br/><a href="mailto:reinhard@idt.net">reinhard@idt.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM">http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM</a></p></div>
