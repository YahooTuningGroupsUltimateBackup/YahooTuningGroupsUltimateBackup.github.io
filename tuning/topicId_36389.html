I didn&apos;t ever measure a fret but I remember<br/>&gt; occassionally moving some of them up or down for a better sounding<br/>&gt; interval. The &quot;standard&quot; major/minor/just intervals are no problem.<br/>&gt; However, I try to get 12/11 or 11/10 seconds (or 150~165 cents) which<br/>&gt; are vital. I also try to get 5/4 instead of a ditone.</p><p>I&apos;m a fledgling 31et guitarist. 31et is a meantone and as such is<br/>never (to my knowledge) mentioned as a good vehicle for these musics<br/>as they reach back towards pythagorean tuning. I think the guitar<br/>has the ability to tolerate things that would beat like crazy on a<br/>piano, hence, though I find the 9/8 approximation to be a little<br/>weak, I usually find the fifths to be fine.</p><p>Some of my improvisation is what some might hear as &quot;Oriental<br/>flavored&quot; although I don&apos;t really pursue any fixed Maqam.

I&apos;m not a newby, actually. I come and go occassionally but<br/>cannot follow regularly bacause of the very high messaging traffic.<br/>I&apos;m, on the other hand, totally a novice in tuning theory and<br/>although it does interest me, I cannot understand most of the thing<br/>(lattices, terms etc.) because of my lack of background information.</p><p>&gt; Some of my improvisation is what some might hear as &quot;Oriental<br/>&gt; flavored&quot; although I don&apos;t really pursue any fixed Maqam.</p><p>In Turkish (Ottoman) music (at least since early 18th c.),<br/>compositions (including improvisations, except for some urban/popular<br/>songs) have not depended on a particular scale or sort. Actually, a<br/>makam is determined by its melodic progression and usage of<br/>structural elements (tetracords etc.). You can, however, construct<br/>scales which would serve for analytical purposes from any makam<br/>progression.</p><p>&gt; An<br/>&gt; example scale (that does have a name that I don&apos;t remember) is :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; intervals       4     4    5     5    4     4     5<br/>&gt; degrees      0     4     8    13  18     22   26<br/>&gt; rational    1/1  11/10  6/5  4/3  3/2  18/11  9/5<br/>&gt; cents        0    155   310  504  696   852   1006<br/>&gt;</p><p>You can name this scale (referring to makams) as Huseyni but as I&apos;ve<br/>said above, a piece in this scale do not have to be in Huseyni since<br/>makam character is independent of the scale. Husyni pieces do use<br/>(for instance) 9/8 or 8/5, too, without &quot;modulating&quot; to another makam.</p><p>&gt; Regarding your comment on the 12/11 or 11/10... Is it an<br/>&gt; important property that this be a bisection of the &quot;minor<br/>&gt; third&quot; used by the performer, or do players nuance the<br/>&gt; difference in sizes? Similarly, for those players who<br/>&gt; use a mode with a tetrachord like<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is it important that the 9/8 be differentiated from the<br/>&gt; 10/9 or do they play the 9/8 as a bisection of the 5/4?</p><p>When performers are concerned, you can find a maximum of three (at<br/>best bet) who are involved with the tuning stuff! Traditionally,<br/>Turkish music is taught orally and it has to be so to pass the vital<br/>properties from one to another.</p><p>Regarding the bisection of minor third, it&apos;s a characteristical<br/>cadential structure found in many makams and performers &quot;slide&quot; (not<br/>essentially by glissando) the second degree up or down to get the<br/>best interval. My interpretation of 11/10 or 12/11 (I prefer the<br/>prior electronically cunstructing or composing) is a &quot;tuning-wise&quot;<br/>explanation attempt. However, 12/11 and 13/12 are what&apos;s found in old<br/>sources (Farabi... to Abdulkaadir... to N&acirc;s&imath;r Dede et al.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; FWIW, I did some finger-position measurings on my Ud, which is a<br/>&gt; &gt; fretless instrument, so more practical for legati and pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; preciseness. For instance, 13/10 fourth came out from such<br/>&gt; &gt; measurements rather than mathemetical calculations. (It&apos;s used to<br/>&gt; &gt; form a Sab&acirc; tetrachord/pentachord 10:11:12:13:15)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a very interesting construct. About your 13/10, do you<br/>&gt; sense this as the same size step as the two preceding it? For<br/>&gt; instance, in 31et, 13/12, 12/11 and 11/10 are all the same thing<br/>&gt; and I wonder if that is a desirable property or if it is missing<br/>&gt; a necessary inflection.</p><p>Intervals become existent when they are performed, imho. In Turkish<br/>music (as I hear them more or less fixed in Arabic/Persian practice),<br/>especially the second (major, minor or &quot;else&quot;) is rather flexible.<br/>Regarding the Sab&acirc; example, you need to manipulate the fourth degree<br/>as the melody requires. It can be as wide as 11/10 or even narrower.<br/>However, I insistently played (improvised) some Sab&acirc; and used the<br/>fourth degree oftenly (say, A-D). I observed that I was tending to<br/>keep it at the same finger position and I measured the string length.<br/>The ratio was interestingly 1.3 which came out to be 13/10.</p><p>Speaking theory wise, you would find three types of second intervals<br/>in &apos;classical&apos; resources: &quot;Tan&icirc;n&icirc;&quot; (whole tone, 9/8 or<br/>10/9), &quot;Bakiye&quot; (semitone, generally 16/15 or 256/243 in Pythagorean<br/>influenced constructions) and &quot;Mucenneb (Mujannab?)&quot; (function as<br/>major or minor depending on the circumstance, can be 11/10 to 14/13).<br/>Hence, hear it or not, the three mentioned intervals are &quot;the same<br/>thing&quot;.</p><p>I have to refer to performance (recordings) to make it clearer. Below<br/>are a couple of links to the two important (&quot;must have&quot;) CDs of the<br/>greatest living performer of Turkish music genres, composed or<br/>improvised: K&acirc;ni Karaca. If you decide getting them, you&apos;ll<br/>understand the &quot;pitch shifting&quot; clearly. (For the record, I&apos;m not<br/>working for the recording company, nor am I an affiliate. I don&apos;t<br/>even like them but I don&apos;t know of any better, either.)</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.kalan.com/english/scripts/album/dispalbum.asp?id=745">http://www.kalan.com/english/scripts/album/dispalbum.asp?id=745</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.kalan.com/english/scripts/album/dispalbum.asp?id=428">http://www.kalan.com/english/scripts/album/dispalbum.asp?id=428</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m familiar with tetrachords and comfortable with (rightly<br/>&gt; or wrongly) stacking them to create octave scales.<br/>&gt; Do you stack pentachords to form a non-octave scale?
