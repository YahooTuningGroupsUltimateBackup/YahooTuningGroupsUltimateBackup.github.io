A lot of it is now<br/>much clearer.</p><p>I started this post as a series of questions about what<br/>I still didn&apos;t understand, but by working thru it I&apos;ve<br/>gotten most of it.  I decided to post my working-out here<br/>in the hope that it will help others to understand.</p><p>A few questions remain below...</p><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 4:35 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: 13-limit mappings<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mapping by period and generator:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ([1, 0], ([0, 2, -1], [5, 1, 12]))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first two-element list shows the mapping of the octave.  The second<br/>&gt; element is always zero for both my scripts, as the period is always a<br/>&gt; fraction of an octave.</p><p>So in other words you always use the nearest integer here?<br/>I&apos;m still confused about that &quot;0&quot;.</p><p>&gt; So the first number tells you how many equal<br/>&gt; parts the octave is being divided into.  Here it&apos;s 1 which is the<br/>&gt; simplest case.</p><p>Confused about this too... I thought this example divided the<br/>octave into 41 parts?  Again, is this pair of numbers expressing<br/>the nearest integer fraction of an octave?</p><p>Also, I think it&apos;s confusing the way you give the &quot;octave correction&quot;<br/>first and the &quot;number of generators&quot; second in this line, but<br/>it&apos;s reversed in all the following lines, generator first and<br/>octave second.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In more familiar terms, the generator is a 5:4 major third.  5 major<br/>&gt; thirds are a 3:1 perfect twelfth.</p><p>(2^(380.391/1200))^5  does indeed equal exactly 3.</p><p>Following you so far...</p><p>&gt;  An octave less two major thirds is a 9:7 supermajor third.</p><p>OK... using the regular ratios (which I understand<br/>are only approximated by your generator)...</p><p>In regular math:</p><p> 2 / ((5/4)^2) =  2 * (16/25) = 32/25</p><p>In vector addition:</p><p> 2/1    = [ 1 0 0]<br/>(5/4)^2 = [-2 0 1] * 2 = [-4 0 2]</p><p>and</p><p> [ 1  0  0]<br/>-[-4  0  2]<br/>----------<br/> [ 5  0 -2]  =  32/25</p><p>32/25 is ~7.7 cents narrower than 9:7, but both of these are<br/>approximated well by your actual result of 2 / ((2^(380.391/1200))^2).</p><p>So I follow this too.  Now comes the tricky part...</p><p>&gt; (2*(5,0) - (12,-1) = (-2, 1))</p><p>OK, so as I said above, ((2^(380.391/1200))^5) * (2^0)  = 3 .<br/>The &quot;2*&quot; means that we square that, and so the first group<br/>stands for 3^2 = 9 .</p><p>And  ((2^(380.391/1200))^12) * (2^-1)  =  ~6.983305074 ,<br/>which agrees with your definition above as ~7.</p><p>The minus sign means we divide the terms, and...<br/>Voil&iuml;&iquest;&half;! ... ~9/7 .</p><p>And checking the answer:<br/>((2^(380.391/1200))^-2) * (2^1)  does indeed equal the ~9/7.</p><p>So you&apos;re putting an equivalence relationship in here.</p><p>That was confusing... I had a hard time understanding how<br/>~9/7 = &quot;An octave less two major thirds&quot;.  Now it&apos;s clear.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; mapping by steps:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [(22, 19), (35, 30), (51, 44), (62, 53)]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each pair shows the size of a prime interval in terms of scale steps.<br/>&gt; Call the steps x and y.  An octave is 22x+19y.  For the case where x=y,<br/>&gt; you have 41-equal.  Where x=0, you have 19-equal.  Where y=0, you have<br/>&gt; 22-equal.  So 19, 22 and 41-equal are all members of this temperament<br/>&gt; family.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3:1 is 35x+30y, 5:1 is 51x+44y and 7:1 is 62x+53y.  You can get any<br/>&gt; 7-prime limit interval in terms of x and y by combining these.</p><p>OK, I understand all the math here, but I&apos;m not quite following the<br/>logic which deterimines that they are &quot;all members of this temperament<br/>family&quot;.  How does your program find the 19, 22 and 41 in this example?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For visualising the scale, it can be simpler to reduce each prime<br/>&gt; interval to be within the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [(22, 19), (35, 30), (51, 44), (62, 53)]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3:2 is  13x + 11y</p><p>Because</p><p> [ 35  30]<br/>-[ 22  19]<br/>----------<br/> [ 13  11]</p><p>&gt; 5:4 is   7x + 6y</p><p> [ 51  44]<br/>-[ 22  19] * 2</p><p>=</p><p> [ 51  44]<br/>-[ 44  38]<br/>----------<br/> [  7   6]</p><p>&gt; 8:7 is   4x + 4y</p><p> [ 62  53]<br/>-[ 22  19] * 3</p><p>=</p><p> [ 62  53]<br/>-[ 66  57]<br/>-----------<br/> [- 4 - 4]</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; and use simpler coordinates.  Here, q=x+y and p=x<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3:2 is  11q + 2p<br/>&gt; 5:4 is   6q +  p<br/>&gt; 8:7 is   4q</p><p>Oops... now you lost me.</p><p>&gt; So q is 2 steps in 41-equal, or 1 step in 22- or 19-equal<br/>&gt; and p is 1 step in 41-or 22-equal, and no steps in 19-equal.</p><p>Getting foggier...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; unison vectors:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [[-10, -1, 5, 0], [5, -12, 0, 5]]</p><p>So these are the ratios 3125/3072 and 537824/531441 ?</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
