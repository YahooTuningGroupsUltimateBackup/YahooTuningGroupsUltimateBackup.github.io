Hopefully the TD will become a<br/>manageable addiction, and you&apos;ll soon be back... I have personally come to<br/>regard the TD as a pretty singular and dynamic source of theoretical (or<br/>technical) information exchange that I can&apos;t quite imagine finding anywhere<br/>else... and as far as I&apos;m concerned, your contribution (to it) will be<br/>sorely missed.</p><p>Best of luck with your endeavors,<br/>Dan</p></div>
