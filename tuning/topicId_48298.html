Most of the articles focused on the building, predictably enough, and no one mentioned anything about the work&apos;s alleged JI tuning, or the success of the performance in that respect. Did anyone here attend? Has anyone heard anything about it? Has JA truly joined the JI ranks?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=48299 href="#48299">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2003 4:59:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; predictably enough, and no one mentioned anything about the work&apos;s<br/>&gt; alleged JI tuning, or the success of the performance in that respect.<br/>&gt; Did anyone here attend?

Simply<br/>amazing performance. They did show the whole rite of spring. Its been a long<br/>time since I&apos;ve listened to that whole piece straight through. Part 1 still<br/>remains one of the most intense orchestral pieces ever written, from first<br/>note to last. The second part is a bit of a letdown, but still has some good<br/>parts. I can only imagine what this must have sounded like to people at the<br/>premiere- no wonder there was a riot! It still  sounds avant-garde today! I<br/>liked the concept of the John Williams piece, with the taped &quot;responses&quot; of<br/>the hall, but the composition didn&apos;t really work so well (to my ears<br/>anyway). The hall is way cool looking, and I was happy to see them pushing<br/>the envelope with the programming, like the Lutaslowski, instead of lapsing<br/>back into beethoven or mahler. All in all, an interesting program.</p><p>Dante</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Jon Szanto [<a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 01, 2003 8:00 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: The Dharma at Big Sur<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; predictably enough, and no one mentioned anything about the work&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; alleged JI tuning, or the success of the performance in that respect.<br/>&gt; &gt; Did anyone here attend?

The FM reception here in Westwood isn&apos;t ideal because of tall buildings everywhere but you can still hear the piece.  It left several of us wishing for more melodic writing.  Some of the reviews I glimpsed at in the Wall Street Journal? were scathing . . . something about a mid-life crisis?</p><p>I recorded it to a CD so if you email me privately I&apos;ll send out a limited number of copies. The whole concert was actually pretty daring. Salonen&apos;s &quot;L.A. Variation&quot;, Yo-Yo Ma and Lutaslowsky&apos;s Cello Concerto, the John Adams and Revueltas. Because I recorded some useless opening night commentary and clapping I wasn&apos;t able to get all four pieces onto one CD. Easiest on me if you just want one cut, say the John Adams.</p><p>I thought this was a milestone for LA and for JI movement in the US.  Definitely high profile and a competent piece.  I don&apos;t get the feeling that he has much experience with the JI medium though.</p><p>I friend of mine fared a lot better, recording the Rite of Spring the night before (opening night of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.)  Listening to it was a revelation that sticks with you for a long time.  Flawless performance.  I&apos;ll have to secure a copy.</p><p>--rt</p><p>Dante Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt;I caught that &quot;great performances&quot; show. The Adams excerpt was miniscule, so<br/>&gt;its hard to say much of anything about it. The cheesy electric violin player<br/>&gt;did not sound too impressive though. On the other hand, I would have given<br/>&gt;the metaphorical left nut to have heard the whole of the Lutaslowski cello<br/>&gt;concerto with Yoyo ma, based on the last two minutes that they aired. Simply<br/>&gt;amazing performance. They did show the whole rite of spring. Its been a long<br/>&gt;time since I&apos;ve listened to that whole piece straight through.

I<br/>&gt;liked the concept of the John Williams piece, with the taped &quot;responses&quot; of<br/>&gt;the hall, but the composition didn&apos;t really work so well (to my ears<br/>&gt;anyway). The hall is way cool looking, and I was happy to see them pushing<br/>&gt;the envelope with the programming, like the Lutaslowski, instead of lapsing<br/>&gt;back into beethoven or mahler.

Adams was interviewed in part, showed a bit<br/>&gt;&gt;of rehearsal (with admissions of chaos), and then about 4-5<br/>&gt;&gt;minutes of the performance.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The soloist, Terry (lastname), was placed in an odd position:<br/>&gt;&gt;standing near the back of the fiddles. Hey, anywhere in the<br/>&gt;&gt;building looks cool, but I watched as the cameral followed<br/>&gt;&gt;percussionists playing glockenspiel and almglocken passages, and<br/>&gt;&gt;I am certain that these were standard 12tet instruments. The<br/>&gt;&gt;segment was brief, but while the &apos;improvised&apos; lines of the<br/>&gt;&gt;soloist evoked a differing intonation, there wasn&apos;t anything that<br/>&gt;&gt;I heard that sounded significantly different from Adam&apos;s other<br/>&gt;&gt;works. But this was the end of the piece, and there may have been<br/>&gt;&gt;calmer sections in the opening (I believe it nears 30 minutes in<br/>&gt;&gt;length) that may have lent themselves to a more honest attempt at JI.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I know people who attended, but I don&apos;t think they know enough<br/>&gt;&gt;about intonation to evaluate for us.

Times 10/29/03.  It reads in part:</p><p>For visitors, &quot;Dharma,&quot; a concerto for electric violin, was one instance of real controversy.  Joshua Kosman, in the San Francisco Chronicle, thought it vaporous and long-winded despite moments of beauty.  In the New York Times, Anthony Tommasini suggested that the balance between soloist and orchestra could have been fixed in two minutes during rehersal.  Susan Elliott, on Musical America&apos;s respected industry Web site, dismissed the work as a musical midlife crisis, describing it as ranging from &quot;crashingly dull to downright annoying.&quot;</p><p>I loved it.  Sure, the violin may have been a bit loud, and there is no question of its grungy timbre, but that was part of the attraction. Adams wrote this piece as a reflection of his adopted state, under the spell of Beat writer Jack Kerouac and composers Lou Harrison and Terry Riley.</p><p>&quot;Write outwards swimming in sea of language to peripheral release and exhaustion.&quot; Kerouac once wrote of his spontaneous prose style. &quot;Dharma&quot; is a tribute to that, to the influence of Indian thought on the Beats and on Harrison and Riley. Written for jazz violinist Tracy Silverman, the score is an extension of the long sitar-inspired violin lines in Adams&apos; celebrated Violin Concerto, but it is also fresh and new in its sustained languorous beatitude.</p><p>Last season, Adams behaved himself writing his Sept. 11 memorial, &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls,&quot; for the New York Philharmonic, and nostalgia got the better of him in &quot;My Father Knew Charles Ives&quot; for the San Francisco Symphony. But in &quot;Dharma,&quot; he lets his defenses down. California is now home, and more than ever before, the new work makes him one of us. With Silverman&apos;s raucously amazing electric violin, with Salonen getting the Philharmonic to glitter like Kerouac&apos;s &quot;jewel center of interest,&quot; &quot;Dharma&quot; breathed real life into Disney.</p><p>This hall is being almost universally hailed as a modern masterpiece, and there is no question that modern music suts it and it suits modern music. . . . .</p></div><h3><a id=48345 href="#48345">ðŸ”—</a>Rick Tagawa &#x3C;ricktagawa@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2003 10:32:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I found Susan Elliott&apos;s review after subscribing to a 14-day free trial to Musical America</p><p>Opening Night No. 2: &apos;Living in L.A.&apos;<br/>By Susan Elliott<br/><a href="http://MusicalAmerica.com">MusicalAmerica.com</a><br/>October 28, 2003</p><p>LOS ANGELES - Oct. 24, Night Two of the thre opening-night concerts at Walt Disney Concert Hall. ,&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>As a longtime fan of John Adams&apos; music, I can only conclude that this latest oeuvre signifies some sort of mid-life crisis, a need to be hip, perhaps. He wrote the piece for electric violinist Tracy Silverman, whose loud meanderings over the orchestra ranged from crashingly dull to downright annoying. The whole, 25-minute exercise reminded me of a &quot;pops&quot; concert, where the orchestra is essentially a backup band with &quot;singing strings,&quot; and the vocalist is out front embellishing self-important fillips of little or no musical interest.</p><p>Toward the end of the work, Silverman backed off sufficiently to reveal some of the luscious color Adams had provided for the orchestra. Too bad the LA Philharmonic had to wait that long to shine on a work it had commissioned for the opening of its glorious new hall. Fortunately, the evening&apos;s closer left a better taste in the mouth. Dated and derivative though &quot;Sensemay&iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot; may be, it complimented its proponents&apos; strengths to fun, colorful effect.

The programming was designed to show off not only architect Frank Gehry&apos;s remarkable new $274 million creation -- an exuberant, acoustically sumptuous palace of swirling steel and wood -- but also the virtuosity, stylistic flexibility and personality of the orchestra.</p><p>It succeeded beautifully on all counts.</p><p>The centerpiece of Friday&apos;s contemporary-music program was the world premiere of &quot;The Dharma at Big Sur,&quot; a blissed-out Golden State reverie commissioned for the occasion from composer John Adams. There was also more bracing fare by Witold Lutoslawski, Silvestre Revueltas and Salonen himself.</p><p>On Saturday the orchestra, with help from guest conductor John Williams and a handful of cinematic celebrities, paid tribute to some of the classic film music of the past 70 years, including works by such masters as Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, Elmer Bernstein and Bernard Herrmann.</p><p>Taken in tandem with Thursday&apos;s opener, the evenings added up to a beguiling snapshot of musical life in the Southland -- venturesome, swaggering and ready to embrace whatever cultural developments may be passing through.</p><p>In addition to its own extravagant charms, at once noble and puppyish, Disney Hall reveals anew the strength and resilience that this orchestra has attained under Salonen&apos;s leadership.</p><p>Throughout these three nights, from the aggressive cross-rhythms of Stravinsky&apos;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; to the lush string textures of Newman&apos;s score for &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; one kept coming back to the splendor of the orchestral playing -- the lithe solidity of the string playing, the clarity and urgency of the brass.</p><p>Those qualities came through most persuasively in Friday&apos;s opener, Salonen&apos;s extraordinary &quot;L.A. Variations.&quot; Written for the orchestra in 1996, this virtuoso showpiece has become a calling card of sorts for both composer and orchestra, and the reasons are obvious.</p><p>In the course of 19 minutes of dense, witty and vivaciously exciting music, Salonen swivels the spotlight onto each section and each member of the orchestra, inspiring them to ever-greater feats of rhythmic and instrumental execution. The range of colors, textures and dramatic moods is remarkable; the puckish ending is a memorable gem.</p><p>In contrast to hard-driven intensity of Salonen&apos;s score, Adams&apos; new work, inspired by the writings of Jack Kerouac and the music of California icons Lou Harrison and Terry Riley, is laid-back to a fault. The piece has moments of beauty -- particularly the ravishing sunrise of the first few pages -- but on the whole it struck me as a vaporous and (at nearly half an hour) long-winded affair, an orchestral spin-off of the composer&apos;s noodly &quot;Hoodoo Zephyr.&quot;</p><p>The work&apos;s soloist and muse is violinist Tracy Silverman, whose improvisatory classical-jazz fusion, played on an electric six-string instrument of his own devising, piqued Adams&apos; interest. It&apos;s easy to see why; the sounds he produces, with their bent notes and sinuous phrases, are both piercing and poignant.</p><p>But &quot;The Dharma at Big Sur&quot; strings those phrases across long expanses that don&apos;t change much or -- until the boisterous Rossinian crescendo that brings the piece to an improbable conclusion -- even do much. Though the solo part is fully composed, it might as well be improvised as it shambles along.</p><p>Pleasures of a more abrasive sort came courtesy of cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who joined the orchestra for a punchy, cantankerously elegant performance of Lutoslawski&apos;s 1970 Cello Concerto, and the program concluded with Revueltas&apos; &quot;Sensemaya,&quot; the Mexican master&apos;s classic little essay in tautly coiled rhythms.</p><p>Saturday&apos;s program began with another commissioned world premiere, this one from Williams. &quot;Soundings,&quot; a gleaming, industrialized 14-minute essay, took pains to celebrate the new hall, especially in an electronic section that sent the sounds of a flute ensemble bouncing around the room, Tinkerbell-fashion.</p><p>Williams and Salonen then traded conducting duties as the orchestra went through a whirlwind history of film music, from Steiner&apos;s wonderfully pictorial 1933 score for &quot;King Kong&quot; to Bernstein&apos;s Coplandesque &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and Herrmann&apos;s powerful music for &quot;Vertigo.&quot;</p><p>There were some spoken introductions by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones -- delivered in the semi-robotic TelePrompTer cadences familiar from so many Oscar ceremonies -- as well as a handful of movie songs.</p><p>Most amazing, naturally, was the incomparable Audra McDonald, who brought down the house with &quot;10,432 Sheep,&quot; a Jule Styne-Sammy Cahn novelty about love- induced insomnia drawn from a 1951 Doris Day flick titled &quot;The West Point Story.&quot; She also delivered a thrillingly direct account of Henry Mancini&apos;s &quot;Two for the Road.&quot;</p><p>Brian Stokes Mitchell&apos;s muzzy rendition of David Raksin&apos;s &quot;Laura&quot; was hard to make out, but Josh Groban&apos;s quavery, out-of-tune botch of &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; unfortunately came through all too clearly.</p><p>E-mail Joshua Kosman at <a href="mailto:jkosman@sfchronicle.com">jkosman@sfchronicle.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:jkosman@sfchronicle.com">mailto:jkosman@sfchronicle.com</a>&gt;</p><p> &iuml;&iquest;&half;

He wrote the piece for electric violinist Tracy Silverman, &gt;whose loud meanderings over the orchestra ranged from crashingly dull to &gt;downright annoying. The whole, 25-minute exercise reminded me of a &gt;&quot;pops&quot; concert, where the orchestra is essentially a backup band with &gt;&quot;singing strings,&quot; and the vocalist is out front embellishing &gt;self-important fillips of little or no musical interest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Toward the end of the work, Silverman backed off sufficiently to reveal &gt;some of the luscious color Adams had provided for the orchestra. Too bad &gt;the LA Philharmonic had to wait that long to shine on a work it had &gt;commissioned for the opening of its glorious new hall. Fortunately, the &gt;evening&apos;s closer left a better taste in the mouth. Dated and derivative &gt;though &quot;Sensemay&iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot; may be, it complimented its proponents&apos; strengths to &gt;fun, colorful effect.

But a critic who knows someone in the LA Phil sent me what is supposedly the inside dope on John Adams&apos; The Dharma at Big Sur. Apparently the piece was finished &quot;too late&quot; to rehearse the JI tuning - which I translate to mean that the piece got no more rehearsal than most new orchestra pieces get - and it was quickly adjusted back to 12tet. The question is, will anyone ever pick the piece up in the tuning that was intended?</p><p>True or not true, it reinforces my long-held opinion that nothing in my profession could be more Quixotic, more masochistic, than writing an alternative-tuning orchestra piece. I once heard a very well-intentioned, nobly rehearsed performance of Ben Johnston&apos;s JI Symphony, and the out-of-tuneness was pitiful.</p><p>Cheers regardless,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=48361 href="#48361">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2003 12:02:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; True or not true, it reinforces my long-held opinion that nothing in<br/>&gt; my profession could be more Quixotic, more masochistic, than writing<br/>&gt; an alternative-tuning orchestra piece.

What you haven&apos;t talked about is<br/>whether you feel that your particular skills and musical choices are<br/>recognized in your chosen profession, in some way that *you* know (even if<br/>*they* don&apos;t) relates to your unique experiences *outside* of the normal of<br/>that culture.  Or, if the *particulars* of your expression go unrecognized,<br/>is there still joy in it for you?  If not, then what you are doing there is<br/>just having your day job, which might as well be working at a bank.  Unless<br/>you feel there is some crossover, some feed-through of your experiences<br/>between the two worlds which actually informs you or conects you or inspires<br/>you or sustains you in some way other than in the money you make.  So is<br/>there more of this story to be told, that might make more sense out of it,<br/>even to you?  Your inspiration is (potentially) our inspiration.  Is what<br/>keeps you going purely the joy of those moments of your own musicality,<br/>mostly unrecognized in your professional context?  Or is there more?  Or is<br/>there no need for more because that is actually enough?</p><p>&gt; and then I come home and<br/>&gt; work in the other world, the other language, the other mindset.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It will not happen on the symphony orchestra concert stage, which is most<br/>&gt; probably all for the good. Too much baggage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You think otherwise? Show me why, and back it up.</p><p>I agree.  One doesn&apos;t go around &quot;changing&quot; people or cultures.  Change<br/>happens where there is curiosity.  Where there is curiosity, relationship<br/>can develop.  And there lives what is sustainable without a fight.  So where<br/>is that?  In the corners or in-between places of that drab comfortable<br/>culture, or only outside of it?  What, other than fighting might be your<br/>role in sustaining the small things that *are* growing?</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3><a id=48363 href="#48363">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>11/7/2003 6:28:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/7/2003 2:42:04 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:kgann@earthlink.net">kgann@earthlink.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; True or not true, it reinforces my long-held opinion that nothing in<br/>&gt; my profession could be more Quixotic, more masochistic, than writing<br/>&gt; an alternative-tuning orchestra piece.

It is difficult for you to imagine<br/>what is going on here because it has not been spelled out.  Also you don&apos;t know<br/>the Ives score, which is critical to the decision that was taken.  Jon, you<br/>don&apos;t understand the constrictions of doing concerts in NY, especially for large<br/>ensembles.  You don&apos;t know the specific contract that I have with music union<br/>#802.  You don&apos;t know everything, so I become mythical to you.  Hopefully, it<br/>won&apos;t take more than another year of two for materials to become available.</p><p>The Ives used my conducting core players direct to disc and with a digital<br/>video.  My players could then follow the video conductor using headphones to<br/>hear the other tracks already laid down.  (Jon, if you know this already, please<br/>excuse as it is for other readers.)  The tuning was in extended Pythagorean<br/>tuning.  We were able to retune the piano, organ, etc.  The sound is<br/>unbelievable as Mike Thorne is quite a legend as to recording musicians.  It has been 4<br/>years in the making.  Though I am quite proud of the premiere performance of<br/>the Ives &quot;Universe Symphony,&quot; there is no unanimity about the finishability of<br/>the piece, or if there is even a piece there.  I wrote a book to this effect<br/>that I will have to self-publish because the bigger &quot;academic&quot; publishers think<br/>it won&apos;t sell enough copies.  I am presently in negotiation to be able to<br/>release my Finale score of the work.  wish me luck</p><p>&gt; &gt; Apology accepted.  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep, and now that I am cleared up on the history (I bet we talked about all<br/>&gt; that back on the Mills list) the apology is right here in print!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Let&apos;s table this for now so I can get back to work, getting these materials<br/>out to the public.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=48416 href="#48416">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>11/9/2003 11:19:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/9/03 12:36:59 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:alternativetuning@yahoo.com">alternativetuning@yahoo.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Exactly.

And perhaps I should have more carefully honed my original statement: nothing in my profession could be more Quixotic, more masochistic, than writing an alternative-tuning piece for an existing, established orchestra. A JI orchestra would have to be, by definition, a different animal altogether - made of of newly collected players, no doubt, not used to playing together by long experience, but more in tune and more called upon to closely listen to each other to fall perfectly in tune. It would be the beginning of a whole new performance practice, and you couldn&apos;t really compare it to the traditional orchestra.</p><p>But please, this is just to sum up.

Rather than rewrite what I said on my blog (<a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic">http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic</a>), I simply copy that for you here:</p><p>Following up on a previous blog entry, I&apos;ve received two reports of John Adams&apos; The Dharma at Big Sur, his new orchestra piece with the LA Phil premiered at the Disney Center, which was to be Adams&apos; first foray into the alternative system of tuning known as just intonation. According to one third-hand report, there wasn&apos;t enough rehearsal time to deal with the tunings, and the piece was played in conventional tuning. However, according to a more official report I received, this wasn&apos;t quite true. Finnish composer Juhani Nuorvala subsequently interviewed Adams in Helsinki for the Finnish music magazine Rondo and e-mailed me the results. Nurovala is himself a just-intonation composer, which I was excited to hear, both because he&apos;d know what to ask Adams about, and also because in the microtonal world it&apos;s supposed that none of the European microtonalists use just intonation, and I was glad to hear of a counterexample.</p><p>According to Nuorvala, there had indeed been little rehearsal time, and many of the musicians couldn&apos;t get what Adams was aiming at. Some of the brass players reportedly said that it was no use trying to get the high overtones Adams wanted, but the harps were retuned. Adams hopes for more rehearsal time at the Proms in London, and perhaps the tunings will work out better there.</p><p>And as it so happens, someone also slipped me a bootleg recording of The Dharma at Big Sur (you&apos;ll never learn who, I protect my sources), so I&apos;ve had a chance to judge for myself. I can&apos;t really better Nuorvala&apos;s description: &quot;...it was laid back and pretty, reminding me of Adams&apos; electronic studio record, Voodoo Zephyr. The tuning didn&apos;t sound as special as I expected, and I was unsure what I was hearing though there were some 7/4&apos;s [seventh scale degrees lowered by about a third of a half-step]. Harmonically the music was pretty static, the orchestra forming a background texture for the soloist&apos;s improvisatory quasi-Indian style lines.&quot; This is all true, and I indeed hear some intentionally flat seventh scale degrees at the beginning. Overall, however, except for some quasi-Indian sliding around by the solo violinist Tracy Silverman, the unconventional tunings don&apos;t seem to come off. It is a lovely piece, though - I find it probably the most attractive Adams piece I&apos;ve heard since the 1980s.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=48509 href="#48509">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>11/17/2003 9:06:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/16/2003 4:51:43 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:kgann@earthlink.net">kgann@earthlink.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; and many of the musicians couldn&apos;t get what Adams was aiming at.

As director of the Frank Gehry-designed Fisher Center, she was invited out to see the Disney Center, and happened to be introduced to Adams in the hall. (She even appeared, unidentified, on TV in a brief news clip, listening to Salonen rehearse some other piece.) It sounds as though the orchestra members didn&apos;t want to go out of their way to understand the tunings, and rehearsal time was brief. I may have spoken too loosely in blog-ese about the &quot;high overtones&quot; - Nuorvala says Adams was trying to get 7th harmonics above 11th harmonics, which wouldn&apos;t be the actual overtone probably, but some 77/64 relationship. The remaining question is, does Adams know enough about the practical details of coaxing microtones from standard instruments to have gotten what he wanted given enough time and good intentions? Who knows? Would the performance been more in tune if, say, Johnny Reinhard had been present to make it happen? Indubitably.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=48511 href="#48511">ðŸ”—</a>rumsong &#x3C;rumsong@telus.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2003 10:07:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The remaining question is, does Adams know enough about<br/>&gt; the practical details of coaxing microtones from standard<br/>instruments<br/>&gt; to have gotten what he wanted given enough time and good<br/>intentions?<br/>&gt; Who knows?

One of the saddest examples is the Piano Quintet of Arthur<br/>Fickenscher as it was recorded with the aged Fickenscher at the<br/>piano.  There are not that many microtonal inflections, and<br/>Fickenscher reduced his demands from what I believe would<br/>have been his theoretical ideal.</p><p>But given the shoddy string tuning through the performance, I<br/>would prefer that they had just gotten something close to a<br/>&apos;standard&apos; tuning.  The recording is as Fickenscher&apos;s biographer<br/>said a travesty.  How he must have winced at the sounds...</p><p>A massive educational effort is required, I fear.</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Gordon Rumson</p></div><h3><a id=48564 href="#48564">ðŸ”—</a>juhani nuorvala &#x3C;jnylenius@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/2003 10:53:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Nuorvala says Adams was trying to get 7th harmonics above 11th<br/>&gt;harmonics, which wouldn&apos;t be the actual overtone probably, but some<br/>&gt;77/64 relationship.</p><p>Adams was actually not trying to get such a relationship.<br/>This is a misunderstanding caused by a typo in my email to Kyle Gann.<br/>I wrote &quot;7ths of 11ths&quot; instead of &quot;7ths or 11ths&quot;.
