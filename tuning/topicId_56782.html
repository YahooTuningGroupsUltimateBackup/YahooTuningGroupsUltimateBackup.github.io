Consequently, none is &grave;superior&grave; to the other as if by racism or nationalism. A gothic architecture contains as much artistic beauty as an Islamic mosque or palace from the same era, although a completely different style! Likewise, it is absurd to assume that a particular genre of music is inferior just because it does not conform to the rules that satisfy a particular listener somewhere else...</p><p>This, however, is a sad little detail Turkey has not been able to overcome yet. The reason why certain &grave;so-called universal&grave; composers around here are not acknowledged around the world is probably due to the fact that their works are clouded by some supremacist ideology leading to a despicable form of bigotry. In my opinion, the world of music should openly shun this primitive mentality wherever it may be found...</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2005 9:04:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In my opinion, the world of music should openly shun this primitive<br/>mentality wherever it may be found...</p><p>Maybe not &quot;shun&quot; it, for that certainly put us in a judgemental role,<br/>not that different from the &quot;supremecist&quot; attitude you mention.

The great philosophers and musicians of our history are very much known to have shunned all sorts of segragationist propaganda in favor of a higher humane ideal without feeling the need to partake in political activism. Also, feeling sympathy with a worthwhile cause on an individual basis does not necessitate open advocacy of a united coalition or its opposition.</p><p>My &grave;war&grave; against those who, by their very existence are inclined to the supremacy of their culture, is a very personal one which, I hope, can succeed in drawing some sympathy and positive support from international circles, and thus, lead to some creative solutions.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Jon Szanto<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 25 Ocak 2005 Sal&imath; 2:01<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Humanism vs all forms of tyranny</p><p>  Ozan,</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>  &gt; Why not &quot;shun&quot; it?
