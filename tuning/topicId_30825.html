It all depends on which set of 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals you use the best approximations of!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What does that have to do with it? Best approximations really does<br/>&gt; not work as a way of thinking about any temperament, equal or<br/>&gt; otherwise.</p><p>So then how can you say what the map is between 21-tET and 7-limit<br/>intervals, &quot;without qualification&quot;?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>12/4/2001 4:51:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So then how can you say what the map is between 21-tET and 7-limit<br/>&gt; intervals, &quot;without qualification&quot;?</p><p>I already gave it: g21(2)=21, g21(3)=33, g21(5)=49, g21(7)=59,<br/>g21(11)=72.
