I also enjoy playing the chords and hearing the effect<br/>as one moves around in the lattice - thanks for suggesting it.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a possibility to make it into a musical instrument isn&apos;t it.</p><p>Probably one of the things I will think about when<br/>I get on to the chord section in FTS - though I wouldn&apos;t be at<br/>all surprised if someone else gets there first :-)</p><p>Robert</p></div>
