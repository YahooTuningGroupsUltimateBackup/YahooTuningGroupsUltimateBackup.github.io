PM can make some<br/>amazing sounds. Though I haven&apos;t had the opportunity to hear<br/>Yamaha&apos;s VL series or Korg&apos;s Z1, I have tinkered a little with<br/>IRCAM&apos;s Modalys (very non-real time) software (for PowerMacs)<br/>and it can produce beautiful tones that do not sound artificial, but the<br/>high<br/>quality sound makes it obvious it was not recorded with a microphone.<br/>It is sound with clarity &amp; definition that would be ideal<br/>for Xenharmonics.</p><p>Has anyone here tried Yamaha&apos;s (Windows 95/98 only, I think)<br/>software real-time PM synth : SondiusXG ? Does it have tuning<br/>tables ?</p><p>- Drew</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/1999 10:38:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Just wanted to bring up physical modelling.</p><p>   As I understand it, Brian McLaren has been experimenting with it, and<br/>finds it impressive.  I think John Chalmers said that he found there were<br/>limits on Yamaha&apos;s tuning implementations for them.</p><p>   What do you John C, or John Loffink for that matter, know about that?</p></div>
