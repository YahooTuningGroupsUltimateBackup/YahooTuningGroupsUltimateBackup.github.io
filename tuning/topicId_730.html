The prime opens up an entire new mode revealing new identities a main example being the 7/4 or 7th harmonic. If we had stayed with the 5 limit we would never gotten this new identity. You simply must have prime #s to advance up the spiral. And I do not think anyone at Dreamhouse will be<br/>tampering with Lamonte&apos;s Installation.  11 reveals new tones almost all new except for the 11/11 22/11 0r 11/1 of course and then 13 and 17 are similar in their New Music Resources.<br/>I hope this helps.</p><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Dave Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I earlier agreed that large integers were probably important for the effect of La Monte Young&apos;s 9:7:4 installation, but asked for someone to explain why they needed to be prime (or at least having few prime factors other than 2&apos;s).

So the presence of  126hz in relation to a 128hz (The Obsidian Ocelot..) is definitely a feeling before it is an audible idetification.<br/>I am not necessarily interested in say a 22/21 as much as just the 21 or 31 or 17  as a frequency definition. The 17,19 or 31 of any fundamental whether that be 10 or twenty octaves below something is going to have a unique, un-mapped sound. And the regular folk might not be able to tell a 16/15 from a 17/16 but hey I can and through some consistent exposure a normal listener will be able to feel then hear the diifie.And eventually the 28/27 and there we are past 19.<br/>I really don&apos;t think there&apos;s an argument here --the harmonic spiral(dna) however you would like to define it-- just is--<br/>&quot;No why-just a dip&quot; or if that is too oriental for ya &quot;The Universe works whether we understand it or not&quot;--FZ.

Note that for intervals smaller than a twelfth (3/1) there is always such a lower-numbered ratio within 8.4 cents of any ratio of 23. Some are as close as 2.8 cents. Apart from human discrimination, the 23rd partial of many natural timbres, if it has a significant amplitude at all, could easily differ from 23 times the frequency of the fundamental by a similar number of cents.</p><p>I agree that using sustained sine tones, and playing them at high amplitudes or passing them thru a non-linear system, will emphasise the difference tone effect, and play down the coincidence of harmonics. This may allow people to distinguish ratios near 1, such as 23/22 from 22/21. This is because the pitch change in the difference tone is (in this example) about 22 times that of the change in one of the original tones (assuming that only one tone changes). You get a kind of leverage by working near 1/1. (Note that if the tones of a 23/22 are below A(440Hz) the difference tone will below 20Hz (infrasonic) and may be perceived more as roughness). But please note that the above effect does not give any special role to primes.</p><p>Once we are depending on difference tones rather than coincidence of harmonics for our musical distinctions, primeness, (and beyond 19, even integer-ness), becomes irrelevant. I expect that, to most people, the difference between 23/22 and 22/21 is much the same as the difference between 22/21 and 21/20 or 22/21 and 21.04348/20.04545, if they have the same difference tone.</p><p>As I understand it, the reason low primes are important in ordinary music with ordinary timbres is that, for example, when the 2nd harmonic of one note coincides with the 3rd harmonic of the other you also get the 4th harmonic coinciding with the 6th, the 6th with the 9th, the 8th with the 12th, the 10th with the 15th. You get all these others for free. This removes *many* pairs of harmonics from contributing to dissonance via critical band roughness.</p><p>When the 23rd harmonic of one tone coincides with some other harmonic of the other tone, we also get the 46th harmonic (if it exists) coinciding for free. Big deal! (Note that the 46th harmonic of A(440Hz) is ultrasonic).<br/>---------------------</p><p>I admit that the above is based more on received authority than personal experience. My personal experience would have put the cuttoff (not that there is any definite one) at 13 rather than 19 but I now accept that barbershop chords include ratios of 17 and 19.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe that any significant music exists where any part of its significance *depends* on a ratio involving primes greater than 19. Which is why I proposed the experiment which will remove the large primes from La Monte Young&apos;s 9:7:4 in a way that I expect will not diminish its significance. (namely by adding one to every multiplier).</p><p>I just searched the index to Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s marvelous scale library <a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/scala/scales.html">http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/scala/scales.html</a> and found ony one scale (out of more than 2000) described as a higher-than-19-limit scale.

It was very interesting,<br/>particularly for the way even slight head movements change the sound. There<br/>are two main areas of sound, a mass of sine tones in a low frequency<br/>region, and another at a high frequency region. The low frequency sounds<br/>reminded me of what I got when I had Csound generate some of the suns<br/>spherical harmonic frequencies, and that got me to wondering if particular<br/>sets of frequencies will have a particular sound, or if it is not a general<br/>effect of massed sine tones that are beating with one another that would<br/>sound pretty simillar no matter what particular frequencies were used. That<br/>is: is there anything special about the frequencies chosen, or would other<br/>sets of frequencies of similar density produce similar (although not<br/>identical) effects. I tend to think a sound sculpture like this is painted<br/>in rather broad strokes and being overly concerned with details might just<br/>be intellectual masturbation.</p><p>The large cabinets in the four corners of the room (with what seem to be<br/>two-foot woofers) face the walls with about six inches of clearance.

This is almost<br/>impossible with the kinds of clusters I like, but this can be nuanced a bit<br/>by attenuating the sine waves in question .</p><p>My initial rationale for avoiding the room resonances was that I was<br/>interested in using the the standing waves to create an alternative,<br/>audible architecture within the gallery space, and wanted this to be as<br/>distinct from the bricks and mortar construction as possible.  As I worked<br/>more with these materials, I found that they projected best when the room<br/>resonances were avoided.</p><p>My impression -- and I claim nothing more than a subjective impression --<br/>remains that using prime or relatively prime relationships make the<br/>individual pitches more distinct.

If you move things up or down the<br/>series by an integer, you will make a lot of the relationships fail to<br/>be in lowest terms, so they will imply a fundamental at multiples (i.e.,<br/>harmonics) of the system fundamental. If all these fundamentals are<br/>actually heard (which is possible through the virtual-pitch phenomenon),<br/>then there will be more pitches, and thus a muddier texture, than if all<br/>relationships are in lowest terms (in which case they all imply the same<br/>fundamental).</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/1999 4:47:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what you are saying here Kraig.
