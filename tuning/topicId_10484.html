I am looking to perform a piece in 12ET, that has<br/>the two manual of the harpsichord tuned a quarter-step different (lower I<br/>think).  I don&apos;t have any tuning equipment and have always tuned by ear,<br/>does anyone have any suggestions on how I should go about this.<br/>&#x9;Also, I am looking to add some mean-tone pieces to my harpsichord<br/>recital if any one has any suggestions, or works of their own that they<br/>would liked performed that would be great.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Steven Kallstrom<br/>Illinois Wesleyan</p></div>
