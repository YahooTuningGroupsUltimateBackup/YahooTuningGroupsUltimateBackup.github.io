Am I<br/>seeing connections when none are there, or is a more fundamental<br/>musical force at work?</p><p>A related interview in Chinese music -- I am sorry I do not have<br/>details as to the source -- is as under:<br/>================<br/>Paula: What are some of the unique characteristics of Chinese music<br/>that sets it apart from Western music? For instance, scales? Tones?</p><p>Josef: The primary differentiator is the pentatonic scale which began<br/>at least two thousand years before the west even had music. It is<br/>still the basis of Chinese music today. So, let&apos;s tie this in with<br/>the above question regarding ontology, OK?</p><p>Since traditional Chinese thinking considers the universe to be one<br/>living interactive system - this can apply to the music where the<br/>artificial abstract world of &quot;notes&quot; is interwoven with the natural<br/>world of &quot;sound&quot; and cosmic laws, with music being one of<br/>the &quot;connecting links&quot; between heaven and earth - as the origin of<br/>music, is too, divine.</p><p>The ancient sages always considered that the overall goal of human<br/>beings was to establish inner and outer harmony, and music, they<br/>believed, had the capacity to bring peace and harmony as it is<br/>inseparably linked to the lives of the people.</p><p>Lets begin with:<br/>1. The Tao - or the all-one, the source<br/>The Tao gives birth to<br/>2. The Qi (pronounced chee) or the universal power - life-force, the<br/>wind of heaven. These two operating factors, The Tao and The Qi work<br/>together to create and maintain the universe and everything of<br/>organic and non-organic matter.</p><p>There are two forms of Qi that we commonly know as yin/yang. Yin<br/>being cosmic female, represented by earth and has the characteristics<br/>of yielding, indulging, cold, moist etc..etc.. Yang, being the cosmic<br/>male - representing the universe and has characteristics of<br/>creativity, warm, dry etc..etc..</p><p>The mutual increase and decrease of yin/yang are responsible for the<br/>5 Developmental Phases which constitute the whole of cosmic life -<br/>They create what we commonly know as the Five Agents:</p><p>1. Earth - corresponding western tone - 1st Tone - Do<br/>2. Metal - &quot; &quot; 2nd Tone - Re<br/>3. Wood - &quot; &quot; 3rd Tone - Me<br/>4. Fire - &quot; &quot; 5th Tone - Sol<br/>5. Water - &quot; &quot; 6th Tone LA</p><p>The Pentatonic Scale...Do, Re, Me, Sol and La are the Chinese<br/>characters; Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, and Yu. Before Western society<br/>was introduced to China, the music was written out with these<br/>characters which stood for the &quot;notes&quot;. This has &quot;shaped&quot; the music<br/>and gives it the unique sound and character that it has. Much of the<br/>traditional music, too, is unison and does not have the harmonic<br/>density of western music.<br/>=========================<br/>The above-mentioned pentatonic scale is Bhupali.</p><p>My question appears to be connected with Margo&apos;s recent postings, and<br/>the responses to it.</p><p>Thanking all in eager anticipation,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2001 11:30:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello all,  I am interested in the relationship between Bhupali raga<br/>&gt; in Indian music and other forms (Chinese, Japanese, Western country,<br/>&gt; gospel, etc.) and keep coming across strange coincidences.  Am I<br/>&gt; seeing connections when none are there, or is a more fundamental<br/>&gt; musical force at work?</p><p>There are extremely fundamental musical (psycho-acoustic) forces at<br/>work here. This is simply a pentatonic formed by an octave-reduced<br/>chain of four fifths (approximate 2:3 frequency ratios). It would have<br/>to be the single most popular scale on the planet and was probably<br/>discovered independently in many different times and places.</p><p>After the unison and the octave, the fifth is the next simplest ratio<br/>and therefore the next easiest to tune by ear. There is a tendency to<br/>stop after chaining four of them because another would introduce a<br/>sixth note which is quite close to the first (compared to the spacings<br/>between the first five notes). Melodically it goes :<br/>s s L s L<br/>where s=small L=large and L/s ~= 1.44</p><p>From an information-theory point of view, with such an arrangement of<br/>step sizes, and so few notes, it is very easy for the brain to<br/>recognise where the melody is at any point in time.</p><p>I&apos;d suggest that almost all popular scales around the world can be<br/>said to have evolved from this pentatonic.

The emphasis here<br/>is on the 7 notes, rather than their &apos;movement&apos;.  Moorchchhana-s are<br/>the complete set of systematic rotations of each of the three grama-<br/>s  [Lewis Rowell]; &quot;Modal scales&quot; [Alain Danielou].</p><p>There are seven notes to a scale.  There are three scales: shadja<br/>grama, madhyama grama, and gandhara grama. So, we have 7 X 3 = 21<br/>moorchchhana-s.  Each moorchchhana has its name (never mind!).</p><p>During each rotation, the tonic changes.  Thus:-</p><p>The seven Moorchchhana-s of Shadja grama, with their shruti<br/>intervals, going in to lower octave, successively (that is, in<br/>descending order):</p><p>1.  4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N<br/>2.  2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D<br/>3.  3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P<br/>4.  4 P 3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m<br/>5.  4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G<br/>6.  2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R<br/>7.  3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N 3 S</p><p>A comparison of the above moorchchhana-s with the Western modes is<br/>interesting.</p><p>A note or two can be skipped to form more types of moorchchhana-s,<br/>respectively called shaadava (= 6) and audava (= 5) types. Each of<br/>the moorchchhana-s, of course, has its presiding deity (never mind!).</p><p>The most important point, almost always missed, is that we should<br/>show ROTATING SHRUTI-S, along with the rotating notes.</p><p>This grama-moorchchhana-jaati system was based on intervals, not on<br/>tonic. The shruti intervals were measured from one shruti to the<br/>next, not from a tonic.  Later developments brought in tonic, and the<br/>tanpura. To be sure, it was the moorchchhana concept that paved the<br/>way for the subsequent raga development.</p><p>Currently, moorchchhana is used to mean instrumental, ornamental,<br/>melodic cluster or finger strokes.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p><p>&gt; Haresh BAKSHI wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., Rick Tagawa &lt;ricktagawa@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fact that a musician describes music in terms of her own<br/>&gt; &gt; culture really hit home to me in an  ethnomusicology class at UCLA<br/>&gt; &gt; where the instructress of Indian music adamantly described western<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music in terms of raga.

George &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi George, here we go ...........<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Moorchchhana  [pronounced moo-r-ch-chh-naa]<br/>&gt;               Commonly misspelled &quot;murchhana&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let us wet our feet a little, in the vast ocean,<br/>&gt; called &quot;Moorchchhana&quot;: the ocean of concept, first killed, and then<br/>&gt; pronounced dead and useless, by Indians, before about 500 years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have seen moorchchhana sometimes being compared with modulation in<br/>&gt; Western music. &quot;Moorchchhana&quot; has been variously translated.<br/>&gt; Sharngadeva&apos;s &apos;sangitaratnakara&apos; is the source material (I,iv,9-26).<br/>&gt; This defines moorchchhana as &quot;the ascending and the descending<br/>&gt; movement of the seven notes in successive order&quot;.  The emphasis here<br/>&gt; is on the 7 notes, rather than their &apos;movement&apos;.  Moorchchhana-s are<br/>&gt; the complete set of systematic rotations of each of the three grama-<br/>&gt; s  [Lewis Rowell]; &quot;Modal scales&quot; [Alain Danielou].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are seven notes to a scale.  There are three scales: shadja<br/>&gt; grama, madhyama grama, and gandhara grama. So, we have 7 X 3 = 21<br/>&gt; moorchchhana-s.  Each moorchchhana has its name (never mind!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; During each rotation, the tonic changes.  Thus:-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The seven Moorchchhana-s of Shadja grama, with their shruti<br/>&gt; intervals, going in to lower octave, successively (that is, in<br/>&gt; descending order):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.  4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N<br/>&gt; 2.  2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D<br/>&gt; 3.  3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P<br/>&gt; 4.  4 P 3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G 4 m<br/>&gt; 5.  4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R 2 G<br/>&gt; 6.  2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N 4 S 3 R<br/>&gt; 7.  3 R 2 G 4 m 4 P 3 D 2 N 3 S<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A comparison of the above moorchchhana-s with the Western modes is<br/>&gt; interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A note or two can be skipped to form more types of moorchchhana-s,<br/>&gt; respectively called shaadava (= 6) and audava (= 5) types. Each of<br/>&gt; the moorchchhana-s, of course, has its presiding deity (never mind!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The most important point, almost always missed, is that we should<br/>&gt; show ROTATING SHRUTI-S, along with the rotating notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This grama-moorchchhana-jaati system was based on intervals, not on<br/>&gt; tonic. The shruti intervals were measured from one shruti to the<br/>&gt; next, not from a tonic.  Later developments brought in tonic, and the<br/>&gt; tanpura. To be sure, it was the moorchchhana concept that paved the<br/>&gt; way for the subsequent raga development.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Currently, moorchchhana is used to mean instrumental, ornamental,<br/>&gt; melodic cluster or finger strokes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Haresh BAKSHI wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., Rick Tagawa &lt;ricktagawa@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fact that a musician describes music in terms of her own<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; culture really hit home to me in an  ethnomusicology class at UCLA<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; where the instructress of Indian music adamantly described western<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; music in terms of raga.  And when I say &quot;adamantly&quot; I don&apos;t mean<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; stridently but as a culture thousands of years old speaking<br/>&gt; through<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; her. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Rick, Did the instructress of Indian music describe Western<br/>&gt; music<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in terms of raga?  I would like to know more about how she did<br/>&gt; it.  I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that that is neither possible nor desirable.  And I do not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; think that it is possible  to analyze a Beethoven Symphony in<br/>&gt; terms<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of a raga.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember being shocked and then being at a loss for words.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Since then I catch myself thinking  about just how a Beethoven<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Symphony could be analyzed as a raga.  This made me ponder just<br/>&gt; what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kinds of western music she might appreciate, often settling<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; jazz but then having second thoughts. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is only rather recently that I have started studying Western<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music. And I listen to a lot of Western music -- all genres as of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; now -- without thinking of whether I like it or not.  Further, I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; NEVER even think of listening to it in terms of Indian music, or<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any raga-s.  I believe that every kind of music (except, perhaps,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; program music) exists in its own right and for its own sake,<br/>&gt; without<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the need for any evaluation or comparison.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, on reading your message, I thought it fit  to describe<br/>&gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rudiments of Western music in terms of Indian music. --<br/>&gt; especially,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; raga-s.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us, for the moment, set aside the difference that Indian<br/>&gt; scale is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; JI, and Western scale is tempered; as also the difference that<br/>&gt; Indian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music is monophonic, and so it does not have provision for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; counterpoints, chords and symphonies.  [And, yet, I believe that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; there are hints of &quot;broken chords&quot; of sorts in Indian music].<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  Recently, imperceptibly soft accompaniement of chords, on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmonium, to a well-known Indian classical singer was heard<br/>&gt; during<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one of her stage performances.  Though technically highly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; objectionable, this did not sound as &quot;cruel&quot; as it should, at<br/>&gt; least<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; partly because we are turning, literally, a deaf ear to such<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; incidents, thanks to the constant bombardment of 12-teT from every<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; possible source of music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  The Scales. In Indian music,too, we have scales, called<br/>&gt; thaats --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a progression of notes in a specific order.  An &quot;equivalent&quot; of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; major scale is &quot;bilawal thaat&quot;; the relative minor would<br/>&gt; be &quot;asavari<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thaat&quot;; the harmonic minor is &quot;Kirwani thaat (borrowed from<br/>&gt; Karnatic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music); the melodic, or &quot;jazz&quot; minor is &quot;Kafi thaat&quot;; the blues<br/>&gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; be &quot;notes of Dhani raga, with additional teevra Ma&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.  The modes.  The modes in Western music. Modes,I understand,<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not related to any key. This is more like Indian music, which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; modal.  So, the Ionian mode reminds one of  Bilawal; Dorian, Kafi;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Phrygian, resembles Bhairavi, except for the shuddha Ni;<br/>&gt; Mixolydian,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Khamaj (Khamaj takes an additional shuddha Ni while ascending);<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aolian, Kirwani; Locrian, like Bhairavi, except that, in place of<br/>&gt; Pa<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in Bhairavi, we have a teevra Ma here.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There, of course, will be some more points to add, if we pursue<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; further.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Haresh.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You do not need web access to participate.
