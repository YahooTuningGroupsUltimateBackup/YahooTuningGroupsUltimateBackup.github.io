I<br/>understand the human tendency to feel and react this way, but it is<br/>thoughtless action resulting in only more thoughtless action on the<br/>part of those whose acts we despise.</p><p>This is exactly the mistake both the Palestinians and Israel have<br/>been making over and over. It is a self-perpetuating hell on earth. I<br/>just heard on the radio yesterday a man who has spent many hours<br/>interviewing imprisoned terrorists, including some of those involved<br/>in the embassy bombing in Africa.</p><p>His conclusions were startling, to say the least. He stated that<br/>these people do not show any signs of mental illness or any profound<br/>emotional disturbances. They consistently report that their lives<br/>went from humdrum meaninglessness to a life of strong commitment to a<br/>cause they believe in and that they believe is a help to their<br/>people.</p><p>They show no signs of repentance after having been, in some cases, in<br/>jail for years. On the contrary, they show themselves to be more<br/>committed than ever, and their sense of pride and status in their<br/>culture is heightened. It should be clear to us all by now that these<br/>people happily give up their lives for their cause.</p><p>No arms, no strong retaliation, no missile defense system can stop<br/>the kind of commitment, raw determination and technical expertise<br/>these people demonstrated yesterday. It only aggravates them further<br/>and increases their determination to destroy us.</p><p>Please understand that I DO NOT INTEND the following statements as an<br/>excuse or defense of any kind for the horrible, twisted things that<br/>terrorists habitually do. But only the most politically naive can<br/>think we in the U.S. have always acted with purity of heart and total<br/>innocence.</p><p>I am essentially a conservative thinker and not a radical. I am a<br/>free-market advocate and all over the map politically, depending on<br/>the issue. But I am also well-traveled and speak fluently more than<br/>just English. I have certain knowledge of many unconscionable things<br/>that U.S. backed &quot;interests&quot; have done in the world. We are not<br/>without dirt and yes, much innocent blood on our hands.</p><p>Does anyone think that a government that allows some of its own<br/>people (blacks) to become medical guinea pigs in experiments that<br/>would normally only be performed on animals is going to be always<br/>clean in its behavior on foreign soil when they go to &quot;protect&quot;<br/>powerful corporate interests? Our government didn&apos;t even tell the<br/>citizens of Nevada to stay indoors and avoid the ashes from nuclear<br/>fallout that fell on their bare arms and legs during above-ground A-<br/>bomb tests and later caused hugely anomalous boosts in the cancer<br/>rates in that region.</p><p>Is a government that acts unilaterally in foreign arenas without any<br/>accountability to its own people, since most U.S. voters never even<br/>learn of these things till years after the decision-makers behind<br/>them are gone from government, is always behaving in a clean, above-<br/>board manner overseas?</p><p>Whether we know it individually as citizens or not, our country has<br/>committed terrorist acts. We have killed huge numbers of innocent<br/>civilians in the implementation of later admittedly mistaken<br/>strategic goals. And at a more subtle but ultimately perhaps even<br/>more powerful level, commercially we invade other cultures with ours,<br/>and shamelessly export immorality that undermines ancient religious<br/>and cultural traditions of proven value in the minds and hearts of<br/>the inhabitants of the regions in question.</p><p>Is it hopeless then? No. I&apos;m an eternal optimist, and just as<br/>committed to my optimism as the terrorists are to their hellish<br/>goals! We need to learn how to eliminate our enemies by taking away<br/>their motivations and their sense of need for violence. Even more and<br/>more top military people in our government and others as well are<br/>starting to think this way.</p><p>Violence breeds violence. We can&apos;t just bomb and shoot and maim and<br/>kill our way out of this one, folks! The Palestinians and Israelis<br/>have been doing that to each other for years and look how well that<br/>has worked for them!...Huh???!!!</p><p>We reap what we sow! Did everyone hear that?!? We reap what we sow.<br/>We are reaping it now! This did not come out of nowhere unless you&apos;re<br/>hiding your head in the sand and in your grade school textbooks...you<br/>know, the ones that ignored our Indian massacres, slavery and<br/>lynching of blacks and grievous exploitation of Chinese labor and<br/>gross disregard for the value of Chinese health and life in the<br/>building of our railways!...the ones that never said a word about the<br/>what we did to our Japanese citizens during WWII (but not to our<br/>German population).</p><p>So wake up, U.S. citizens!!! Learn to vote for something besides how<br/>the economy just happened to be doing under the current incumbent!<br/>The correlation between who&apos;s president and how the economy happens<br/>to be doing during his term is probably close to zero! Yet this is<br/>clearly the number one determinant of whether an incumbent stays in<br/>office! What kind of democracy is THAT?! Democracy depends on<br/>informed citizens that vote intelligently on the basis of the best<br/>information available and issues that actually have something to do<br/>with the candidates!!!</p><p>Right now our corporate interests are recognized under the law as<br/>having the rights of individual citizens, yet corporations are not<br/>human. Humans work for them, but corporations are not human. Are they<br/>even humane? Are they really ultimately, fundamentally any different<br/>from what we see reflected in the behavior typical of recording<br/>industry executives?</p><p>They are equipped in our economy with feedback systems that seek to<br/>maximize SHORT-TERM profits...PERIOD!!!!! Not human values! Not clean<br/>air! Not a non-toxic environment or natural &quot;sanctuaries&quot; that future<br/>generations can continue to enjoy. Not even long-term profits. Their<br/>feedback mechanisms coldly eliminate VISION, human foresight, from<br/>the equation. (Ever think about the meaning of &quot;sanctuary&quot; in the<br/>context of nature, and our feeling of a need for such &quot;sanctuaries&quot;?)</p><p>These non-human corporate entities are what pays for our politician&apos;s<br/>campaigns. And now they own the media to which the politicians pay<br/>their donations in order to promote their campaigns publicly. The<br/>media are understandably not eager to expose or halt this lovely<br/>little incestuous circle.</p><p>But we still have the vote, and if we wake up enough, we can change<br/>it!!!!!! These interests get away with this stuff because WE LET THEM<br/>DUPE US!!!!!!! Let&apos;s stop that and let everyone around us know that<br/>we can. People don&apos;t like to let go of the nice, cozy security<br/>blankets their little grade school textbooks gave them with their<br/>misguided patriotism and political cover-ups. But things are getting<br/>way out of hand on a lot of fronts and now maybe we have a chance to<br/>WAKE PEOPLE UP!!!  WE NEED TO SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY!!!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Charles Lucy&quot; &lt;LUCY@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;it isn&apos;t WWIII,<br/>&gt; &gt;and it&apos;s up to us to make sure that doesn&apos;t happen.<br/>&gt; Totally agree!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whatever transpires, as musicians we are in a unique position<br/>&gt; to influence how people react, and to encourage understanding<br/>&gt; between diverse cultures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is likely to be strong demand for patriotic and martial<br/>music.

But they shouldn&apos;t be a surprise.</p><p>      It is well known that in war, the first casualty is truth - that<br/>during any war truth is forsaken for propaganda. But sanity was a<br/>prior casualty: it was the loss of sanity that led to war in the<br/>first place.</p><p>      Our foreign policy has been insane for decades. It was only a<br/>matter of time until Americans would have to suffer personally for<br/>it. It is a terrible tragedy of life that the innocent so often have<br/>to suffer for the sins of the guilty.</p><p>      When will we learn that we can&apos;t allow our politicians to bully<br/>the world without someone bullying back eventually?</p><p>      President Bush has authorized continued bombing of innocent<br/>people in Iraq. President Clinton bombed innocent people in the<br/>Sudan, Afghanistan,Iraq, and Serbia. President Bush Senior invaded<br/>Iraq and Panama. President Reagan bombed innocent people in Libya and<br/>invaded Grenada. And on and on it goes.</p><p>      Did we think the people who lost their families and friends and<br/>property in all that destruction would love America for what happened?</p><p>      When will we learn that violence always begets violence?</p><p>      Teaching Lessons<br/>      Supposedly, Reagan bombed Libya to teach Muammar al-Qaddafi a<br/>lesson about terrorism. But shortly thereafter a TWA plane was<br/>destroyed over Scotland, and our government is convinced it was<br/>Libyans who did it.</p><p>      When will we learn that &quot;teaching someone a lesson&quot; never<br/>teaches anything but resentment - that it only inspires the recipient<br/>to greater acts of defiance.</p><p>      How many times on Tuesday did we hear someone describe the<br/>terrorist attacks as &quot;cowardly acts&quot;? But as misguided and despicable<br/>as they were, they were anything but cowardly. The people who<br/>committed them knowingly gave their lives for whatever stupid beliefs<br/>they held.</p><p>      But what about the American presidents who order bombings of<br/>innocent people - while the presidents remain completely insulated<br/>from any danger? What would you call their acts?</p><p>      When will we learn that forsaking truth and reason in the heat<br/>of battle almost always assures that we will lose the battle?</p><p>      Losing our Last Freedoms<br/>      And now, as sure as night follows day, we will be told we must<br/>give up more of our freedoms to avenge what never should have<br/>happened in the first place.</p><p>      When will we learn that it makes no sense to give up our<br/>freedoms in the name of freedom?</p><p>      What to Do<br/>      What should be done?</p><p>      First of all, stop the hysteria. Stand back and ask how this<br/>could have happened. Ask how a prosperous country isolated by two<br/>oceans could have so embroiled itself in other people&apos;s business that<br/>someone would want to do us harm. Even sitting in the middle of<br/>Europe, Switzerland isn&apos;t beset by terrorist attacks, because the<br/>Swiss mind their own business.</p><p>      Second, resolve that we won&apos;t let our leaders use this occasion<br/>to commit their own terrorist acts upon more innocent people, foreign<br/>and domestic, that will inspire more terrorist attacks in the future.</p><p>      Third, find a way, with enforceable constitutional limits, to<br/>prevent our leaders from ever again provoking this kind of anger<br/>against America.</p><p>      Patriotism?<br/>      There are those who will say this article is unpatriotic and<br/>un-American - that this is not a time to question our country or our<br/>leaders.</p><p>      When will we learn that without freedom and sanity, there is no<br/>reason to be patriotic?</p><p>      Harry Browne was the 2000 Libertarian presidential candidate.<br/>You can read more of his articles at <a href="http://www.HarryBrowne.org">www.HarryBrowne.org</a>, and his<br/>books are available at <a href="http://www.HBBooks.com">www.HBBooks.com</a>.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No arms, no strong retaliation, no missile defense system can<br/>stop<br/>&gt; &gt; the kind of commitment, raw determination and technical expertise<br/>&gt; &gt; these people demonstrated yesterday.
