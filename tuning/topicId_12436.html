He himself has said that he doesn&apos;t hear<br/>all that much difference between actual 72-tET versions and JI<br/>versions of his music, and in a letter to me has said that he<br/>doesn&apos;t particularly care about the &apos;rationality&apos; of his small<br/>divisions of the pitch-continuum. (I&apos;m paraphrasing, not quoting)</p><p>I coined the term &apos;JustMusic&apos; to refer to *any* (including very<br/>complex) rational tuning systems, but I&apos;ve become more conservative<br/>lately.</p><p>In general, I think it&apos;s OK to equate &apos;just&apos; with &apos;rational&apos;,<br/>but popular usage tends to keep &apos;just&apos; limited to either 5-limit<br/>JI, or to higher-prime but otherwise low-integer JI (i.e., Partch).<br/>For that reason, I often use &apos;rational&apos; to refer to rational<br/>tunings that are more complex than these.</p><p>My &apos;just intonation&apos; Dictionary entry refers to some of this.</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/just.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/just.htm</a></p><p>Other opinions would be most welcome.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=12441 href="#12441">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 7:18:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12438">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12438</a></p><p>&gt; Ezra Sims (I know you don&apos;t like his music, but I&apos;m crazy about<br/>&gt; his Clarinet Quintet and Night Piece) uses 72-tET notation which<br/>&gt; represents a basic 37-limit JI scale as well as many more complex<br/>&gt; ratios when he modulates.</p><p>This is an excellent example of the folly of publicly posting on the<br/>list &quot;I don&apos;t like &apos;so and so&apos;s&apos; music, blah, blah, blah...&quot;</p><p>I actually listened again to Ezra Sims&apos; CD which is out on CRI and<br/>had an ENTIRELY different reaction.
