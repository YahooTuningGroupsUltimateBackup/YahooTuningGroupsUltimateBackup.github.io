This is my new homepage:</p><p><a href="http://www.imeem.com/dawier">http://www.imeem.com/dawier</a></p><p>Previously, I used MySpace, but left because of their six-song limit. Then I tried <a href="http://Last.fm">Last.fm</a>, but this spring they started charging a 3 euro per month subscription fee outside the UK, Germany and the US. Also, both sites have recently been blocked in Turkey.</p><p>I&apos;m still in the process of uploading tracks, and some of them I&apos;ll have to re-record, but hopefully I won&apos;t have to go through all this again. So far, I have several orchestral works, and I&apos;m uploading old rock tracks (sans vocals). Also, I haven&apos;t figured out how to make these available for free download and not just as streaming audio.</p><p>Just wanted/needed to let you all know so you can update if I&apos;m on your links list. Also, I&apos;m still in lurk mode, but I&apos;m following some of the threads. I&apos;ve spend many a year trying to figure out what system of accidentals to use for JI as well as 72 and other ETs, and I&apos;m settling on Helmholtz-Ellis, at least up to 13-limit.</p><p><a href="http://newmusicbox.com/article.nmbx?id=4191">http://newmusicbox.com/article.nmbx?id=4191</a></p><p>The reason: I&apos;m already used to using Tartini-Couper accidentals for quarter tones, and these are used for raising and lowering a note by 33/32. The 27/26 third-tone flat looks a little strange to me, and I might want to use Persian koron instead, but either way. I&apos;m not sure I like the use of diagonal marks, pluses and minuses and arrows on the side for 17-limit and up. I wouldn&apos;t need those for 72 ET anyway.</p><p>~D.</p></div>
