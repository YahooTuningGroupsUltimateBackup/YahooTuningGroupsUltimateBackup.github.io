If it has, I might with due caution<br/>present my suggestion as an &quot;alternative&quot; name to be used along with<br/>the established one.</p><p>Accordingly, I here propose the name _Sesquisexta_, the Latin name for<br/>the proportion or ratio 7:6, literally &quot;and again a sixth&quot; -- or<br/>&quot;again a sixth part of the whole.&quot;</p><p>This name is intended especially to honor Jacobus of Liege, who in his<br/>_Speculum musicae_ (c. 1325), Book Four, specifically mentions<br/>sesquisexta or 7:6 as a superparticular ratio forming part of the<br/>series intervening between the usual Pythagorean ratios of<br/>_sesquitertia_ or 4:3 (the fourth) and _sesquioctava_ or 9:8 (the<br/>whole-tone). He concludes that these intervening ratios are not used<br/>because they do not fit the regular system of tones and semitones, but<br/>notes that such ratios do occur in Greek theory. He also describes and<br/>demonstrates the 64:63 septimal comma as well as the 81:80 syntonic<br/>comma.</p><p>Briefly, Sesquisexta is a tuning of two 12-note Pythagorean manuals in<br/>standard Eb-G# tunings at the distance of a pure 7:6 (~266.87 cents),<br/>making available pure sonorities of 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 (the<br/>neo-Gothic &quot;7-flavor&quot;) in 11 locations.</p><p>At the same time, of course, all of the usual Pythagorean steps and<br/>sonorities are available on either keyboard.</p><p>The keyboard layout invites stunning forms of &quot;21st-century<br/>fauxbourdon&quot; involving parallel 7-flavor sonorities, maybe recalling<br/>at once Dufay and Debussy. It might be taken as an offshoot on the<br/>late medieval English technique of &quot;sights&quot; in improvised discant, a<br/>point I&apos;d like to research and explore further.</p><p>Anyway, &quot;Sesquisexta&quot; seems to me a propitious name, whether as one of<br/>first impression, or as another synonym for a tuning which for me has<br/>a most transporting character.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
