There is no basis in the enharmonic system<br/>&gt; for 19, is there... or is there...</p><p>Yes! I&apos;m sure I will be only one of many in a flurry of responses here.<br/>Using the cammon system of enharmonic sharps and flats makes perfect sense.<br/>19tET is almost a form of meantone. Handel used meantones with 19 notes<br/>per octave. In the Baroque era, there were harpsichords with split keys<br/>so that enharmonics could be played. Obviously few if any used<br/>mathematically pure 19tET at that time (it&apos;s possible someone could have<br/>done it on a lute), but they did use scales that had both Db and C# as<br/>separate notes and some of those scales were really really close to<br/>19tET.</p><p>In general I personally feel that a MIDI file and a precise description of<br/>the tuning (possibly embedded as a standard MIDI tuning message) and<br/>instrumentation (possibly embedded as sysex patch data) is a more accurate<br/>form of notation than western notation BUT if you are writing music to be<br/>played by a performer, you need something else. I believe that using sharps<br/>and flats to notate 19tET makes sense both from a standpoint of being easy<br/>for the performer in certain situations and having historical precedent. As<br/>an aside, I do believe that if you are going to play that notation on a<br/>black and white keyboard, you should use a split key configuration keyboard<br/>or you if you are playing 19tET mapped straight across a normal keyboard,<br/>and you want ease of performance to be a consideration you should consider<br/>notating the keys as played but not as sounded.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=18688 href="#18688">ðŸ”—</a>j scott &#x3C;xjscott@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2001 9:36:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think it&apos;s just chance.

Handel used<br/>&gt; meantones with 19 notes per octave.</p><p>BTW1, this was the 12 usual notes + enharmonic<br/>equivalents for each of 5 black keys + B# &amp; E#.<br/>BTW2, I do not mean to imply that all 19 notes<br/>used were 2^(1/19), though they were close.</p><p>Jorgensen also claims that the 1/3 syntonic comma meantone<br/>of Salinas, circa 1577 is pretty similar to 19tET:</p><p>From &quot;Tuning&quot; by Owen Jorgensen (1991), pg. 94:</p><p>&quot;In the Aaron temperament, the major thirds and minor sixths<br/>were pure in just intonation, and the fourths, fifths, minor<br/>thirds, and major sixths, were each tempered by one-fourth<br/>syntonic comma. The Huygens temperament was based on twelve<br/>notes selected from an equal temperament of thirty-one<br/>micro-tones per octave. The Huygens temperament sounded<br/>almost identical to the Aaron temperament. In the Huygens<br/>temperament, the major thirds were tempered the smallest<br/>imaginable amount wide.</p><p>&quot;In the quest for finding a temperament whereby the major<br/>sixths beat slower than the fifths sharing common lower<br/>tones, there was the Francisco de Salinas one-third syntonic<br/>comma meantone temperament published in 1577. In this, the<br/>major sixths and minor thirds were pure in just intonation.<br/>However, Smith probably did not accept this temperament<br/>because the major thirds were beating faster than the fifths<br/>sharing common lower tones. Also, the fifths were beating<br/>too rapidly for good taste. The Salinas temperament is<br/>similar to a selection of twelve tones taken from equal<br/>temperament based on nineteen tones to the octave. The<br/>Salinas temperament was acoustically the opposite from the<br/>Aaron temperament in that the major thirds were beating too<br/>fast in the Salinas, whereas the major sixths were too fast<br/>in the Aaron when compared to the fifths. Robert Smith did<br/>approve of a temperament invented by Mr. Harrison whereby<br/>the major sixths beat slower than the fifths. The Harrison<br/>temperament sounded somewhat similar to the Salinas, because<br/>the major thirds were still a shade faster than the fifths<br/>and the fifths were still on the rough side for good taste.<br/>Mr. Harrison&apos;s fifths had a ratio of 1.49441151. The ratio<br/>of Pietro Aaron&apos;s fifths were 1.495348782. In the Salinas<br/>and Harrison temperaments, the difference of effects between<br/>the major and minor modes was greatly reduced compared to<br/>the modern effects that we are accustomed to.</p><p>&quot;Robert Smith&apos;s own temperament of 1749 was more practicable<br/>to tune than was Harrison&apos;s, and it was an almost exact<br/>compromise between the Harrison and Aaron meantone<br/>temperaments: sqrt(1.49441151 x 1.495348782) = 1.494880072.<br/>Smith&apos;s temperament was very similar to a selection of<br/>twelve tones taken from equal temperament based on fifty<br/>microtones to the octave. In this, the fifth had a ratio of<br/>1.494849249 which can be compared to the ratio 1.494880072,<br/>above. The exact ratio of Smith&apos;s fifths was based on the<br/>formula 3X^3 + 4X = 16 where X equals the ratio of the<br/>fifth, or 1.494830501. Smith labeled this temperament &apos;The<br/>System of Equal Harmony.&apos; In this, when a fifth shared a<br/>common lower tone with a major sixth, they both beat exactly<br/>the same speed. Thus, Smith&apos;s new temperament was a form of<br/>equal-beating meantone temperament. ...&quot;</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=18697 href="#18697">ðŸ”—</a>MONZ@JUNO.COM</h3><span>2/14/2001 2:05:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18684.html#18685">/tuning/topicId_18684.html#18685</a></p><p>&gt; For me, to quote Gertrude Stein, &quot;a C# is a C# is a C#.&quot;</p><p>Joe, that&apos;s a paraphrase, not a quote.</p><p>I know... nitpicking... but somebody&apos;s gotta do it, and<br/>Paul hasn&apos;t yet...   ;-)</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=18698 href="#18698">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/14/2001 2:40:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The flurry continues</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was looking at the &quot;popular&quot; notation for 19, using all the<br/>&gt; enharmonics, and I am dead set against it.

If you&apos;re<br/>forming your own band, and meantone-oriented music is important to<br/>you, then why not do a bit of retraining in the simplest notation?  If<br/>you&apos;re going to play traditional music with purer chords, those<br/>enharmonies are going to diverge anyway.</p><p>Cents relative to 12-equal is established as the lingua franca for<br/>microtonal performers, so if you&apos;re only hiring them for the gig that<br/>would be the simplest.</p><p>&gt; I would much rather use REAL NOTES (yes, derived from 12-tET) and<br/>use<br/>&gt; cents deviations from these than something &quot;ersatz&quot; or &quot;faux.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fooey on &quot;faux.&quot;</p><p>That would depend on how close the scale you use is to 19-equal or<br/>meantone.

I, personally, feel such a notational system is poor,<br/>&gt; &gt; since is goes against ALL musicianship &quot;basic training.&quot;  Yes,<br/>and<br/>I  mean 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing in any other tuning would go against that kind of training.<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re presenting a guitarist with a new instrument that has a<br/>few extra frets, it&apos;s easier to say &quot;that&apos;s C# and that&apos;s Db&quot; than<br/>&quot;C# or Db is around here, so you can either play C#-27 cents or Db+26<br/>cents&quot;. There&apos;ll also be similarities between the way major and minor<br/>chords are fingered, and the way either can be turned into<br/>&quot;7-flavour&quot;.</p><p>This, I believe, was what Wim Hoogewerf was getting at...  I can see<br/>it would work well with a &quot;fixed pitch&quot; instrument, where just<br/>&quot;relearning&quot; the physical scale and relating it to a simple notation<br/>would come into play.</p><p>For me, though, it is less convincing for a continuous pitch<br/>instrument like a trombone (which I will be working with) strings, or<br/>voice...  Their 12-tET &quot;compass&quot; is pretty ingrained, and I think it<br/>better to work WITH the grain than against the &quot;woof&quot; (or the wolf).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suppose if someone hasn&apos;t HAD any &quot;basic training&quot; it wouldn&apos;t<br/>be much of a problem, but THOSE are not necessarily the kinds of<br/>&gt; &gt; musicians I am looking for...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would also depend on how long you plan to keep them.  If you&apos;re<br/>&gt; forming your own band, and meantone-oriented music is important to<br/>&gt; you, then why not do a bit of retraining in the simplest notation?<br/>If you&apos;re going to play traditional music with purer chords, those<br/>&gt; enharmonies are going to diverge anyway.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Cents relative to 12-equal is established as the lingua franca for<br/>&gt; microtonal performers, so if you&apos;re only hiring them for the gig<br/>that would be the simplest.</p><p>Well, for the kind of stuff I do, that&apos;s pretty much the way it would<br/>be... so thanks for the commentary...</p><p>_______ ____ ____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=18728 href="#18728">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
