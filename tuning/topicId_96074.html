I stumbled on this while looking for<br/>the super-father temperament I mentioned in the last thread, first as<br/>a <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> subgroup temperament, and then as a 2.3.7.11.13<br/>temperament. The generator is a sharp major second.</p><p>Firstly, you have the 2.7.9.11.13 temperament eliminating 64/63,<br/>99/98, and 648/637. 17-equal is pretty much ideal for this, 28-equal<br/>as well - when we change the 9 to a 3 we will see that 17-equal is the<br/>clear winner. So there seem to then be two ways to ditch the 9 and tie<br/>this into 2.3.7.11.13, which end up being conflated at 17-equal - I&apos;m<br/>not sure exactly what&apos;s going on, but you seem to get a temperament<br/>that&apos;s inconsistent in the 9-limit if you use anything but 17-equal<br/>(which is no problem for a 2.7.9.11.13 subgroup temperament, but more<br/>problematic for a 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup temperament). Perhaps it makes<br/>sense to analyze this as a <a href="http://2.3.7.9">2.3.7.9</a>&apos;.11.13 temperament, with 9&apos;<br/>denoting the &quot;prime&quot; 9, and then figure out what the two commas are<br/>relative to 9&apos; and 3 that could be tempered, which end up conflated in<br/>17-equal.</p><p>Anyway, time for the magic to happen. There are 6, 11, and 17 note<br/>MOS&apos;s, the 17-equal 11-note MOS is not proper, mapping 3/2 to two<br/>different interval classes, but this seems to be important<br/>nonetheless.</p><p>The 6-note MOS is similar in an abstract sense to the meantone<br/>pentatonic scale in that there&apos;s nice 11-limit harmony everywhere you<br/>go. The 11-note MOS is some kind of miracle of mathematics, because<br/>you have full</p><p>4:7:9 tetrads on 9 roots of it<br/>4:7:9:11 tetrads on a whopping 7 roots of this scale<br/>4:7:9:11:13 pentads on 4 notes of this scale<br/>And there are endless extensions of this if you throw 3 into it as<br/>well, especially with 17-equal where 3 appears in two classes.</p><p>This paradigm really makes 11-equal sing, but I think you need to<br/>explore the 11-note MOS, which despite being the size that it is works<br/>fantastically as a &quot;diatonic&quot; MOS. Try playing with some 4:7:9:11<br/>tetrads and transposing them up and down the scale, you end up getting<br/>some great linked-11 limit triads.</p><p>This scale sounds like something Gene would do wonders with. I have no<br/>idea what to call it. There are such a wide range of synesthetic<br/>impressions here that to pick one and name the entire tuning after it<br/>seems like a disservice. It&apos;s a very stimulating temperament. My<br/>precise first impression was that I understood what it felt like to be<br/>a well-oiled machine, like all of the kinks in my psyche had been<br/>worked out. So machine temperament, maybe?</p><p>Here is a scala file of it:</p><p>!

This is the 11&amp;17 temperament,<br/>and 11&amp;17 * 2 = 22*34 temperament. Pajara strikes again. This is a<br/>no-5&apos;s, 13-limit version of Pajara, kind of. But, on the other hand,<br/>since no 5&apos;s are involved, you don&apos;t get the period halving that<br/>Pajara gave you. So machine is pajara with twice the generator and<br/>twice the period. I&apos;m not sure that it really fits in the<br/>pajara/diaschismic &quot;family,&quot; since there&apos;s no diaschisma to temper out<br/>to begin with, and the resulting tonal structure is completely<br/>entirely different.</p><p>So since 11-equal supports this, 22 does as well. It&apos;s probably better<br/>to think of this as &quot;only&quot; (lol) an 11-limit temperament rather than a<br/>13-limit one in 22. This makes 22-equal a really interesting case of<br/>this temperament: mess with this scale in 22-equal and you get<br/>11-equal but now 3&apos;s and 5&apos;s are involved as well. The 11-note MOS<br/>changes here and becomes 11-equal, and all of the interesting<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; transpositional shifts are gone and you now just get<br/>4:7:9:11 everywhere. However, you now get 5&apos;s and 3&apos;s as well for you<br/>to use, so you can sort of treat 22-equal as an awesomely tonal<br/>11-limit system in which 11-tet is the base 11-limit, no 3&apos;s, no 5&apos;s<br/>scale. This is analogous to how people use 34-equal as a 5-limit (or<br/>13-limit) system in which 17-tet is the base no-5&apos;s scale, or how<br/>people use blackwood as a 5-limit scale in which 5-tet is the base<br/>no-5&apos;s scale. This isn&apos;t what I had in mind originally, but it&apos;s also<br/>an interesting thing to consider. This changes the mapping for 3, but<br/>that might not be a bad thing.</p><p>34-equal is probably even better, because you now get a full 13-limit<br/>temperament, and you still get to take advantage of the 11 note MOS.<br/>So perhaps it makes sense for us to define a machine &quot;family,&quot; which<br/>is defined over the <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> subgroup, and then give it a 13-limit<br/>child and a 9-&gt;3 extension mapping for 17-equal, and then a 5-limit<br/>mapping for 34-equal. And then we should define a different<br/>9-&gt;extension mapping for 22-equal.</p><p>Lots of neat stuff going on here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2011 9:29:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Firstly, you have the 2.7.9.11.13 temperament eliminating 64/63,<br/>&gt; 99/98, and 648/637.</p><p>A better way to put it might be eliminating 64/63, 99/98 and 144/143.

These are very interesting,<br/>although the fact that the 8/7 generator becomes a 3/2 yields like an<br/>entirely different scale structure.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway, time for the magic to happen. There are 6, 11, and 17 note<br/>&gt; &gt; MOS&apos;s, the 17-equal 11-note MOS is not proper, mapping 3/2 to two<br/>&gt; &gt; different interval classes, but this seems to be important<br/>&gt; &gt; nonetheless.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t get that at all.

I&apos;m starting to find planar temperaments more and<br/>more attractive these days.<br/>6) If, instead of messing around with this in 17-equal, you mess with<br/>it in 11-equal, which obviously also supports the 11-note MOS - you<br/>still get 4:7:9:11 all over the place, but the way to tie 3/2 in with<br/>it completely disappears. If you double this you get 22-equal, in<br/>which you also have a 3d version of this temperament in which 5 can<br/>appear whenever you want, but also in which 3 can appear whenever you<br/>want. I&apos;m not sure if it really counts as 3d if 3 is just the square<br/>root of 9, but it never appears in the base 11-note scale.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2011 10:02:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Feb 3, 2011 at 12:54 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here is a scala file of it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, this is the 11-note MOS with tuning 3\17, and that involves entirely different commas than was stated.</p><p>??

Tuned properly, this<br/>scale is very accurate and if nothing else, it has given me a new look<br/>on 11-tet as a tonal system. If you look at it this way, there is an<br/>easy 13-limit extension here that 17 supports really well, and<br/>tempering 64/63 gives you more 3&apos;s, which are just a nice extra bonus<br/>really.</p><p>&gt; Since 28 has such a good 5 it would make sense to use it if you wanted 5s, and you could still use the 11 or 17 note MOS.

So there seem to then be two ways to ditch the 9 and tie<br/>&gt; this into 2.3.7.11.13, which end up being conflated at 17-equal - I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure exactly what&apos;s going on, but you seem to get a temperament<br/>&gt; that&apos;s inconsistent in the 9-limit if you use anything but 17-equal<br/>&gt; (which is no problem for a 2.7.9.11.13 subgroup temperament, but more<br/>&gt; problematic for a 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup temperament).
