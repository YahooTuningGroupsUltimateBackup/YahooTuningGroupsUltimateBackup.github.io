I may suggest something.<br/>&gt; It is more than reasonable to assume that each of the three tones are<br/>&gt; harmonic. So, the list should contain integer multiples of 233.242601,<br/>&gt; 292.197079 and 351.139276 (or whatever are the actual true value). For each<br/>&gt; frequency value in the list, get the best candidate for the fundamental<br/>&gt; among the three values, then compute the percentage of &quot;anharmonicity&quot; by<br/>&gt; seeing how far away it is from the expected harmonic. Eventually convert the<br/>&gt; difference in cents and check out the actual dispersion of the results. That<br/>&gt; should give an idea of teh reliability of the method.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. It will be easy to do - I&apos;ll get FTS to do it<br/>when finding the cents values of the partials.</p><p>It could also find a possibly better value for the fundamentals actually too,<br/>at the same time, by finding the mean difference from it of all the harmonics,<br/>and adding that in.</p><p>Then the standard deviation from that should give a good idea of how<br/>accurate the harmonics are, and the 95% confidence interval for the<br/>harmonics, assuming gaussian distribution.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2002 10:57:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks for the suggestion.

It may be quite a close call between the two methods<br/>once they are both ready; maybe one optimal for some voices<br/>and the other for others.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
