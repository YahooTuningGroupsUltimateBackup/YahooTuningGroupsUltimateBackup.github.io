First, and I mentioned this a while back but got no answer...it&apos;s well known that Bach<br/>(and other musicians of his time as well) would transcribe works from other composers, often from French or Italian musicians, and redo them for other instruments. So, how were these musicians tuning their instruments, and did Bach (and the others) change the tuning to whatever temperament he was using?</p><p>JR: General Musicians in France and Germany and Italy used an extended sixth-comma meantone tuning.  Basically, this is the mean compromise of Pythagorean tuning with quarter-comma meantone.  The extension comes with flexible instruments, like the E# in the bassoon concerto by Vivaldi.  Of course, there was always a harpsichord, or other keyboard to continue the tuning of the basic twelve notes, unextended.</p><p>NH: And if so, did it destroy, or alter in some way, the original musical intent of the piece?</p><p>JR:  It may have moved it into a neighboring quadrant; that&rsquo;s the phraseology that Kirberger used to describe a dimensional shift in tuning with well-tempeament.</p><p>NH:  And, I&apos;ve just been listening to some CD&apos;s of Sylvius Weiss&apos;s lute music (very beautiful); it mentions in the liner notes that he was court lutenist at Dresden for 32 years, and was very highly regarded by the musicians of his time. So, since he was obviously interacting with all sorts of musicians at the court, how did THEY tune?</p><p>JR:  Dresden was a sixthcomma extended tuning city.  Quantz, Frederick the Great&rsquo;s flute teacher and principal musician, built flutes for him with alternative chromatic keys, for greater ease with the extensions.  This was not well-temperament, but a complementary system.  Please note there is not much of a peep about the change in tuning from Praetorious&rsquo; extended quartercomma system to the 18th century sixthcomma.  But it happened.</p><p>NH:  We know lutes were in 12 eq; did the clavier players he played with retune to him? Or, did they just plow ahead in a well temperament?</p><p>JR:  You see now, ET is much closer to extended sixthcomma meantone, so there would be more of a mere coloring factor, if not a sweetening with the mix of temperaments.  There would be no well-temperament.  But one could believe the clavier player would retune to the lute soloist&mldr;if he liked him well enough.</p><p>NH:  How about the singers, flutists, and whoever else was there?</p><p>JR:  They would follow the instrument of least-flexible pitch.</p><p>NH:  And, it&apos;s my understanding that there were other famous and highly talented lutenists on the scene as well; the same question applies to their careers and interactions with other musicians as well. And I don&apos;t think these are insignificant questions; this issue, to me, is much bigger then just how Bach tuned; there were many musicians, on many different instruments, all interacting in various ways at that time (obviously). So, the way different musicians tuned as they played together was, most likely, an important issue.</p><p>JR:  Its just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>NH:  One more thing...Bach&apos;s 5th suite for solo cello was originally in C minor; Bach himself transcribed it for lute, and changed the key to G minor. So...was the original cello version intended for Werckmeister, or something similar? And, when it was transcribed to the other key, if it WAS in a well temp, then all the intervals would have changed slightly for the G minor version...oops, since that was for the lute, it was in 12 eq, so obviously, there goes the subtle shadings of well temp. And, since Bach was responsible for the 12 eq version, I&apos;m assuming it didn&apos;t make much difference to him WHAT key it was played in.</p><p>JR:  All well-temperament sound more in common than any one well-temperament sounds to equal temperament: a truism.  Firstly, C minor in Werckmeister III, and keep in mind that all tunings of the time began on C as a starting pitch (a completely different reference to the key), would have every single pitch of twelve &ldquo;flat&rdquo; to equal temperament.  It is DARK as any meantone can be dark, at least in terms of general usage.  Modulating to any equal temperament would clearly flatten it out.  G minor makes a lot of sense for a lute with a low string G instead of a cello&rsquo;s C.  Most obvious difference of all, the change from cello&rsquo;s lowest string to a more technically versatile lower string on the lute.   The lute needs whatever amplification it can get since it has a softer signal.</p><p>NH.  So, when Bach wrote his unaccompanied suites for cello and violin, which of course were unfretted instruments, would a well temperament have been the intended tuning?</p><p>JR:  My guess is it would be a performer&rsquo;s exaggeration of an agreed upon sentiment of a particular tuning.  C major was always plain and simple and sweet.  C minor was not.  Interesting thing here is that the C minor triad&rsquo;s minor third is 300 cents, exactly the same as in equal temperament!</p><p>NH:  Or, would the performer maybe tweak the intervals to retain pure 3rds (and other intervals) if possible?</p><p>JR:  Man, after Joint with Jon Catler, what ch&rsquo;u talkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout &ldquo;tweak&rdquo;?</p><p>NH: Would they possibly have aimed for a more Pythagorean based scalar approach, since they tuned in 5ths?</p><p>JR:  They had long left the tuning of the ancients, Pythagorean based scales.  Europe had become tempered.</p><p>NH:  Could there have been a number of approaches, depending on the performer?<br/>JR:  John Dowland is a perfect example; Harry Partch is another.</p><p>NH: Hey, this is a cool subject...and, these scenarios have been on my mind for a long time, actually. I am not a Bach scholar, but love his music deeply, so any insights from folks who are more learned in this field would be appreciated...and perhaps more light can be shed on just what was happening in that era, in the field of tunings...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a> <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p><p>JR:  It&rsquo;s all about the love.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
