<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Extended ASCII Viability over Tuning List</h1><h3><a id=79 href="#79">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/1999 3:10:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Earlier I posed the question of what percentage of tuning listers can read an<br/>apparently-standard extended ASCII used by Netscape and Microsoft.  Or more<br/>specifically, I asked whether this:</p><p>                                  &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;</p><p>looked like an umlaut-A followed by the Spanish enyeh (?) followed by the<br/>American cent symbol, all in curly quotes.</p><p>   Here&apos;s what I concluded based upon your replies:<br/>9 people saw those characters exactly as my message described them.<br/>2 people saw at least one character differently.<br/>2 people looked at it using two programs, and read it successfully in one but<br/>not the other.</p><p>   Here are some relevant comments from the folks who did see those symbols<br/>correctly:</p><p>   * &quot;I use CorelCENTRAL as jumpoff for the web and email.  No MAC, &apos;just&apos; a<br/>     PC.&quot;<br/>   * &quot;Pentium II, Windows 98, Microsoft Outlook Express&quot;<br/>   * &quot;Your example  ( &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;)  came through perfectly to my Mac running Netscape<br/>     navigator 3.01.&quot;<br/>   * &quot;I&apos;m using Eudora on a Mac.&quot;</p><p>   And here are some relevant comments from the folks who did not see them as<br/>posted:</p><p>   * &quot;I get the right characters for all, except the quotes are two tiny<br/>     rectangles pointing upward.&quot;<br/>   *  &quot;Pine [didn&apos;t work]. It uses pico as an editor.&quot;</p><p>   So, my conclusion would be that, although it&apos;s probably preferable not to use<br/>these characters routinely, when they&apos;re inconvenient avoid, it seems likely<br/>that most tuning-listers will read them just fine.</p></div>
