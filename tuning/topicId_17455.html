I find this *very* interesting!  Note that the only<br/>note missing from this variant of the theme happens to be<br/>the tonic of the whole piece!</p><p>Mahler did something *very* similar to this at the end of<br/>the 1st movement of his 7th Symphony (the big MIDI-file I<br/>made that I keep hawking).  The chord and other melodic<br/>runs in the penultimate measure, just before the final<br/>unison downward arpeggio in E-major, is very dissonant<br/>and contains a bunch of different notes, but conspicuously<br/>*not* the dominant &quot;B&quot; that one would expect before the<br/>final chord!</p><p>I&apos;m quite certain that Mahler left this particular note out<br/>on purpose.  I believe that this movement, along with the<br/>Scherzo and last movement of the 7th, represent the strongest<br/>influence Schoenberg had on Mahler, and Mahler&apos;s leaving out<br/>the &quot;dominant&quot; in the final cadence appears to me to be some<br/>experimental fun-and-games.</p><p>But getting back to the Mozart G-minor symphony, it&apos;s common<br/>knowledge among Mahler fans that this was one of Mahler&apos;s<br/>favorite pieces, and he conducted it often.  Seems to me that<br/>maybe Mozart&apos;s little move of omitting the &quot;G&quot; may have<br/>inspired Mahler in his 7th.</p><p>(OK, no more on this... it&apos;s become totally off-topic...)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div>
