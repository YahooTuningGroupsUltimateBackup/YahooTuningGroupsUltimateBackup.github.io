It&apos;s nice to have SOME frame of reference when<br/>off in weird worlds.</p><p>I&apos;m sure many people have complimented Manuel for his wonderful program<br/>Scala, but I would also like to add my humble encomium, for what it is<br/>worth.</p><p>I believe Scala coupled with a synthesizer is one of the most exciting<br/>things I have encountered in my entire LIFE of music!</p><p>___________ _________ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
