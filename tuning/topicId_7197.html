The tuning you gave Wim is fine for<br/>&gt;experimenting on a 12-tone keyboard.</p><p>&gt;But you&apos;re missing a very important point of Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>&gt;theory.</p><p>&gt;He plainly advocated 12-EDO for the &apos;common keyboard&apos; and<br/>&gt;other &apos;usual&apos; instruments.</p><p>If a Renaissance piece had 12 or fewer written pitches in a chain of fifths,<br/>Woolhouse would have surely advocated retuning to 7/26-comma meantone.<br/>Woolhouse advocated 12-tET for the &apos;common keyboard&apos; only because most<br/>post-Renaissance pieces use more than 12 written pitches in a chain of<br/>fifths, e.g., they typically use both G# and Ab or at least one similar<br/>enharmonic pair, and would thus need extra keys to be able to play this<br/>music in 7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;The reason he went thru the<br/>&gt;trouble to calculate the 7/26-comma meantone and to advocate<br/>&gt;its close EDO approximations of 50-EDO and 19-EDO, was to<br/>&gt;be able to have *two* different sizes of semitone, one<br/>&gt;&apos;diatonic&apos; and one &apos;chromatic&apos;</p><p>That&apos;s a weird way of putting it, but anyway, you still get two different<br/>sizes of semitone, even with only 12 notes in a chain of fifths.<br/>Specifically, you get 7 diatonic semitones, and 5 chromatic semitones.</p></div>
