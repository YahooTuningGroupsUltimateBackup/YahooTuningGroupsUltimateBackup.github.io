I would like to thank John Starrett for providing<br/>an excellent refretting guide on his web page.  It&apos;s a good, concise<br/>instruction manual.</p><p>I&apos;ve been playing with it at every opportunity and have a few impressions<br/>so far.  I&apos;m tuning to a standard EADGBE, by fourths (9/22) with the G-B a<br/>supermajor 8/22 units.  Tuning the strings has been slightly tricky so far,<br/>partly just out of simple disorientation from the new tuning, and partly<br/>because I think the intonation is still not quite properly set.  I&apos;ll get<br/>to it sooner or later...</p><p>One of my first feelings was of dismay when attempting to play a few<br/>chords.  I was not expecting fingering to be this difficult!  I guess when<br/>I look at it now, duhh, things are obviously a lot tighter than they used<br/>to be in 12.  What I hadn&apos;t thought about is fitting fingers on the same<br/>fret on two adjacent strings.  The distance between the strings has not<br/>changed, but the fingers now bunch up on top of each other because there is<br/>less &quot;horizontal&quot; space to fit those fingertips.  Also, something like a<br/>standard barred E or A chord is far more difficult than in 12 for similar<br/>reasons.  In 12 there is lots of space for the fingers -- now the<br/>fingertips must be moved further out from my barred finger, creating a much<br/>more difficult stretch.  Someone please tell me that all this gets easier<br/>with practice!!</p><p>So far I&apos;ve been noodling around with a few scales and familiarizing myself<br/>with some of these new things.  Scale-noodling has included various<br/>tetrachordal scales (enharmonic, subminor diatonic...) and Paul E&apos;s<br/>decatonic.  A chain of 12 fifths also has some cool effects.  I haven&apos;t<br/>gotten to a point of really creating much Music yet; just listening to new<br/>sounds and having fun.</p><p>Any comments or suggestions from 22-er&apos;s and others would be welcomed.<br/>(e.g. What kind of hay should I feed it?)</p><p>digging out from the snow,<br/>kp</p></div><h3><a id=1473 href="#1473">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;g.breed@xxx.xx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/1999 3:04:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Kris Peck wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What I hadn&apos;t thought about is fitting fingers on the same<br/>&gt;fret on two adjacent strings.

It seems most microtonal guitarists are<br/>double jointed with ultra-thin fingers or something.  This is the reason I<br/>fretted my guitar to a subset of 31-equal, rather than the whole thing.<br/>I&apos;ve had more trouble with chords I can&apos;t get my fingers around than chords<br/>that aren&apos;t there on the fretboard.  22-equal means the frets are a bit<br/>wider spaced so you might find it easier with practice.  Otherwise, you&apos;ll<br/>have to choose different fingerings.  Hopefully all the new chords you can<br/>play will make up for the old ones you can&apos;t find anymore.</p><p>One solution would be to widen the neck and lose a fret.  I have nothing but<br/>respect for those who play with 7 strings!</p><p>&gt;Any comments or suggestions from 22-er&apos;s and others would be welcomed.<br/>&gt;(e.g. What kind of hay should I feed it?)</p><p>It&apos;s really not a good idea to put hay in any musical instrument.  It will<br/>tend to deaden the vibrations.  Now, if this is what you want, don&apos;t let me<br/>stop you in the full flight of your experimentation.  Just don&apos;t expect<br/>anything special out of it.</p></div><h3><a id=1476 href="#1476">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/1999 4:17:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Some MOS scales worth playing with are the 5-,12-, and 17-tone MOSs built<br/>of 9/22nds or 13/22nds,</p><p>0           4           8             13          17             22<br/>0        3  4        7  8       11 12 13       16 17       20 21 22<br/>0     2  3  4     6  7  8    10 11 12 13    15 16 17    19 20 21 22</p><p>the 7- 10- 13- 16- and 19- tone MOSs built of 7/22nds or 15/22nds</p><p>0  1  2                 8  9                15 16                22<br/>0  1  2  3              8  9 10             15 16 17             22<br/>0  1  2  3  4           8  9 10 11          15 16 17 18          22<br/>0  1  2  3  4  5        8  9 10 11 12       15 16 17 18 19       22<br/>0  1  2  3  4  5  6     8  9 10 11 12 13    15 16 17 18 19 20    22</p><p>the 4-, 5-, 9-, and 13- tone MOSs built of 5/22nds or 17/22nds:</p><p>0                    7             12             17             22<br/>0     2              7             12             17             22<br/>0     2     4        7     9       12    14       17    19       22<br/>0  1  2     4     6  7     9    11 12    14    16 17    19    21 22</p><p>and the 7-, 8- and 15-tone MOSs built of 3/22nds or 19/22nds:</p><p>0           4        7       10       13       16       19       22<br/>0  1        4        7       10       13       16       19       22<br/>0  1  2     4  5     7 8     10 11    13 16    16 17    19 20    22</p></div><h3><a id=1522 href="#1522">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I&apos;m tuning to a standard EADGBE, by fourths (9/22) with the<br/>G-B a<br/>&gt;supermajor 8/22 units.</p><p>That&apos;s how I tune mine (except I have a low B, too). I tried other<br/>tunings that would have been better in theory, but only this tuning<br/>allowed me to fly (because I played 12-tET guitar in standard tuning for<br/>8 of the last 11 years, and I always think of a 1-fret shift when going<br/>between the G and B strings, relative to the 3 years when I tuned the<br/>12-tET EADGCF).</p><p>&gt;Also, something like a<br/>&gt;standard barred E or A chord is far more difficult than in 12 for<br/>similar<br/>&gt;reasons.  In 12 there is lots of space for the fingers -- now the<br/>&gt;fingertips must be moved further out from my barred finger, creating a<br/>much<br/>&gt;more difficult stretch.  Someone please tell me that all this gets<br/>easier<br/>&gt;with practice!!</p><p>I never had much trouble with the E-form, but my fingers are kind of<br/>skinny. The A-form and Em-form require different fingerings than before,<br/>because of the comma; these do get difficlut high up on the neck.<br/>Em7-form is a real challenge (in open position, the fret numbers are 0 4<br/>1 1 0 0).</p><p>&gt;Scale-noodling has included various<br/>&gt;tetrachordal scales (enharmonic, subminor diatonic...) and Paul E&apos;s<br/>&gt;decatonic.  A chain of 12 fifths also has some cool effects.  I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;gotten to a point of really creating much Music yet; just listening to<br/>new<br/>&gt;sounds and having fun.</p><p>I&apos;m only proficient with the pentachordal decatonic scale in one<br/>position:</p><p>e - 1 3 5 7<br/>B - 1 3 5 7<br/>G - 0 2 5 7<br/>D - 0 2 5 7<br/>A - 1 3 5 7<br/>E - 1 3 5 7</p><p>and haven&apos;t learned to shred on this yet since all my past shredding<br/>involved less than four notes per string. Try the near-equal heptatonic<br/>scales 0 3 6 9 13 16 19 (22), which sounds like a cross between Arabic<br/>and Thai scales, and 0 4 7 10 13 16 (19), which approximates harmonics<br/>8-12. Also try my blues scale: 0 6 9 10 13 19 (22). Certain modes of the<br/>chromatic tetrachordal scales make great Indian scales -- the ones where<br/>the root and fifth have chromatic neighbors -- but this works in 12-tET<br/>too. In 22-tET, find good voicings of utonal tetrads. Play otonal<br/>tetrads and pentads with distortion -- sounds like Jon Catler.</p></div><h3><a id=1523 href="#1523">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
