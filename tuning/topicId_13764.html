Or his books _Please<br/>Understand Me_ and _Please Understand Me II?_ Well, I haven&apos;t. But I was<br/>reading some political news and followed a link to two different Keirsey<br/>Personality Tests, which attempt to classify your personality into one of 16<br/>categories. The two tests gave me two different answers. The first test,<br/>with 70 questions, classified me as a Champion (eNFp):</p><p><a href="http://www.keirsey.com/personality/nfep.html">http://www.keirsey.com/personality/nfep.html</a><br/>Who are Carl Rogers and Molly Brown (&quot;famous&quot; eNFp&apos;s)???</p><p>The second test, with 36 questions, classified me as an Architect (iNTp).<br/>Please read the following description:</p><p><a href="http://www.advisorteam.com/keirsey_rational_architect.html">http://www.advisorteam.com/keirsey_rational_architect.html</a></p><p>hmm...maybe the architect in me dislikes the inconsistency between the two<br/>presonality classification tests, but the champion in me makes me want to<br/>report these interesting results to all 384 of you . . . and to tell you how<br/>very surprised I was to find such specific traits of my own personality come<br/>up as a result of answering such trivial questions . . . but then the<br/>architect wants to step in and say that this is akin to astrology . . .</p><p>Follow the links and find out your own personality!</p></div><h3>Paul H.
