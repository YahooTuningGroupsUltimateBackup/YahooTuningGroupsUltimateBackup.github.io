I have to confess that my sources are not<br/>&gt; necessarily reliable (the internet :o}[not only]), that I have a hard<br/>&gt; time telling apart the Northern and Southern traditions and generally<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know much about Indian music..., but if I only faintly consider<br/>&gt; making a fool of myself with my theories, this seems the right time to<br/>&gt; do so. Here we go:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assumption #1   The concept of the 22 srutis is more ancient and very<br/>&gt; likely different from their interpretation in terms of just and<br/>&gt; pythagorean values (which were probably imported from Arabian<br/>&gt; theorists--likely with a change in actual musical practice--in the time<br/>&gt; of the moguls at the latest).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assumption #2   The srutis define a grid on which to place the 7 svaras.<br/>&gt; If you come up with scales that are modes of each other (maybe with a<br/>&gt; comma difference here or there) such a fine grid seems like overkill. So<br/>&gt; it is reasonable to assume that there were scale genera with distinct<br/>&gt; interval sizes, and srutis were used to relate quite different types of<br/>&gt; scales. The unequivocal equation of 4 sruti=9/8, 3 sruti=10/9, and 2<br/>&gt; sruti=16/15 that you find is probably too simple and inaccurate; it may,<br/>&gt; on the other hand, be assumed that srutis of different sizes are taken<br/>&gt; from a harmonic series, where *one* grouping of four sruti equals 9/8<br/>&gt; &amp;c. And finally, if you want to define a grid, you don&apos;t go by your<br/>&gt; voice, you take an instrument. This instrument was the vina.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assumption #3   (Concerning some gestalt aspects of interval cognition, a<br/>&gt; topic I couldn&apos;t find anything on. Glad about hints!) Going by my<br/>&gt; totally subjective personal experience, there is no succesive interval<br/>&gt; in the continuum that stands out like 9/8. From there I can extrapolate<br/>&gt; 10/9 to find 5/4, and I can divide it into 17/16 and 18/17. To openly<br/>&gt; generalize, I posit that there is something in the ear/brain connection<br/>&gt; that can adjust (&quot;tune&quot;) smaller units (&quot;intervals&quot;) so that they yield<br/>&gt; a larger unit that is &quot;simpler&quot; (is this a definition of &quot;harmonic&quot;?).<br/>&gt; The 9/8 is a natural starting point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The vina        has four strings, two pairs an octave apart that are tuned to a<br/>&gt; 4/3.<br/>&gt; The problem:    How to place your frets for a specific type of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let us assume you already have determined the places of 4/3 and 3/2. You<br/>&gt; divide the 9/8 between them into four parts by ear (=with all the<br/>&gt; accuracy you need); the possibly idealized intervals are 33/32, 34/33,<br/>&gt; 35/34, and 36/35.<br/>&gt; Then you extrapolate the intervals downwards: 32/31, 31/30. These give<br/>&gt; you 16/15.<br/>&gt; Extrapolate further. After 3 times, you have 10/9: 28/27, 29/28, 30/29<br/>&gt; (i.e., 30/27).<br/>&gt; You also have a 4/3: 28/27, 29/28, ... 35/34, 36/35, i.e., 36/27.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The nine intervals on the lowest open string are (28, 29, 30, ... 35,<br/>&gt; 36)/27. Sharing a possible fret, they correspond exactly to these nine<br/>&gt; intervals in the 4/3 string: (112, 116, 120, ... 140, 144)/81. Another<br/>&gt; 9/8 is needed to complete the octave. Again: divide 4 times (36/32). On<br/>&gt; the higher string, four more intervals are added: (33, 34, 35, 36)/18.<br/>&gt; 9+9+4=22: the sruti.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The interesting part<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Three scale genera or grama were reported and identified by their sruti<br/>&gt; steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The least problematic is Shadja Grama, 4-3-2-4-4-3-2, which yields a<br/>&gt; well known sequence when started right in the middle (the fifth sruti)<br/>&gt; of the lower tetrachord:<br/>&gt;         9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 27/16. 15/8<br/>&gt; is available on the pair of strings tuned an octave higher. (All 22<br/>&gt; sruti from this starting point are<br/>&gt;         _1/1_, 33/32, 17/16, 35/32, _9/8_; 7/6, 29/24, _5/4_, 31/24, _4/3_,<br/>&gt; 11/8, 17/12, 35/24, _3/2_, 99/64, 51/32, 105/64, _27/16_;; 7/4, 29/16,<br/>&gt; _15/8,_ 31/16. _2/1_.)<br/>&gt; [&quot;;&quot;: string 4/3 up, &quot;;;&quot;: string 3/2 up]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Madhyama Grama (4-3-4-2-4-3-2) is said to start on Pa (the fifth degree)<br/>&gt; which makes many commentators rotate the scale they determined in the<br/>&gt; first place. No need to do this here: You start counting from the 4/3<br/>&gt; string which makes the lowest available tone a 3/2. Extinct for quite<br/>&gt; some time; I don&apos;t remember and can&apos;t find whether it was still used in<br/>&gt; the Mogul era.<br/>&gt;         8/7, 5/4, 45/32, 3/2, 12/7, 15/8<br/>&gt; selected from<br/>&gt;         _1/1_, 29/28, 15/14, 31/28, _8/7_, 33/28, 17/14, _5/4_, 9/7 297/224,<br/>&gt; 153/112, _45/32_, 81/56;; _3/2_, 87/56, 45/28, 93/56, _12/7_, 99/56,<br/>&gt; 51/28, _15/8_, 27/14, _2/1_.<br/>&gt; The same count of four sruti that gave 9/8 in Shadja Grama gives 8/7<br/>&gt; here, showing the inadequacy of 22-ET to approximate the sruti.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lastly, there is Gandara Grama (4-3-2-4-3-3-3), described as either<br/>&gt; nonexistent--apparently there is a fable, where an ass declares himself<br/>&gt; able to sing in all three gramas, not knowing that Gandara Grama is a<br/>&gt; mere theoretical construction to please some god--or as being extinct<br/>&gt; for a long time, having a high tessitura and being kept secret by hunter<br/>&gt; societies. With this setup of sruti, however, you find a scale<br/>&gt; reminiscent (except for the seventh harmonic being lowered to allow for<br/>&gt; another 9/8-10/9 grouping) of alphorns, jaws harps and musical bows if<br/>&gt; you start from the top of the higher tetrachord and does have a high<br/>&gt; tessitura on the vina:<br/>&gt;         9/8, 5/4, 3/2, 5/3, 11/6<br/>&gt; taken from<br/>&gt;         _1/1_, 33/32, 17/16, 35/32, _9/8_;; 7/6, 29/24, _5/4_, 31/24, _4/3_,<br/>&gt; 11/8, 17/12, 35/24, _3/2_; 14/9, 29/18, _5/3_, 31/18, 16/9, _11/6_,<br/>&gt; 17/9, 35/18, _2/1_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I take the fact that there are often more than seven &quot;good&quot; but unused<br/>&gt; intervals available from a given starting note as a strong indication<br/>&gt; that the purpose of the sruti was indeed to regulate the seven svaras<br/>&gt; themselves for a given style, not to account for a certain number of<br/>&gt; ornamental notes. The ornaments themselves are a different matter--very<br/>&gt; much to learn for a singer, if he wants to stick to the generating<br/>&gt; pattern of the sruti on the vina, and probably regarded as superfluous<br/>&gt; by the vina player himself as soon as he is done with fretting his<br/>&gt; instrument.
