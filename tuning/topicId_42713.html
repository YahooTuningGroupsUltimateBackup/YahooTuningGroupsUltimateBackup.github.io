Notice<br/>the blue-orange-white bars in the picture; this represents how close<br/>the pitch is to the nearest 12-eT equivalent. I find it interesting<br/>how the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right is &apos;close&apos; (almost all<br/>5 bars), while the diagonal from bottom-left to top-right is &apos;far&apos;<br/>from 12-equal (almost 0 bars).<br/>What would the diagram look like if I used more iterations?</p><p>Then I thought of an idea to repesent 7-limit in a 3 dimensional cube<br/>(or even 9-limit in 4 dimensions). Has this ever been done before?<br/>If so, then I would be very interested to see the comparison with 12-<br/>eT in the same implementation as the above picture.</p><p>Finally, and on a different topic, does anyone know of a utility to<br/>convert an MP3 or wav from 12-eT temperament to 3 or 5 limit JI (or<br/>vice versa).<br/>Perhaps such a program would need to &apos;seperate&apos; all the instruments,<br/>tune them slightly, and then recombine them. Or perhaps all it would<br/>need to do is perform a &apos;frequency sweep&apos; and change the mp3/wav on<br/>the fly. Any thoughts?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Daniel<br/><a href="http://www.skytopia.com">http://www.skytopia.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=42717 href="#42717">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2003 3:48:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel White&quot; &lt;soundburst@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I thought of an idea to repesent 7-limit in a 3 dimensional<br/>&gt; (or even 9-limit in 4 dimensions).
