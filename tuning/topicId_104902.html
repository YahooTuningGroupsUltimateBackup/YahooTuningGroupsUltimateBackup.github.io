The geometry of the Terpstra keyboard layout is characterized by a vertical shift in position between the top surface of a key and the six keys adjacent to it. This results in an intuitive feel for changes in pitch as your fingers move across the keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each key has a removable magnetic key cap, so different colored or labeled key caps can be easily swapped around when you re-map the keys to a different scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The main difference with our keyboard is the expressivity allowed by the mechanical action of the keys, which is completely different from other similar keyboards that had been produced in the past.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The key sensing for the Terpstra is one of a kind because the electronics constantly monitor the position of every key by magnetically sensing for the whole key throw (not by triggering switches at the bottom of the key press and measuring the time differential). When a key is depressed, the entire change in position is monitored and translated to a very accurate and nuanced velocity by the time the key hits the bottom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I am a keyboard player and the feel of the Terpstra was really exceptional and had very expressive touch that was lighter but much like a real piano, only faster.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Every key is easily re-mappable and if mapped to a continuous controller, then slowly depressing any re-mapped key sends out continuous data like a fader in real time.

This means that for the first time you can play a matrix keyboard without having to constantly look at it to know where you are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I would LOVE to map some keys to sweep filters, and leave other keys as notes to trigger the sounds feeding through the filter.
