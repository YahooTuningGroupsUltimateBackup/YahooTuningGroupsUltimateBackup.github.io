But if you don&apos;t mind<br/>about my method being &quot;ahum ... A bit time-consuming&quot;, then you can try to<br/>temper out the three &quot;primary&quot; commas separately and turn the result into a<br/>single temperament. For example, if you want to temper out 126/125 and<br/>225/224 at the same time, you&apos;re also tempering out all multiples or<br/>divisions of these two. This makes it possible to find commas where one of<br/>the primes is missing. So once you decide to temper out both 126/125 and<br/>225/224, then you&apos;re also tempering out 81/80 (no 7s), 59049/57344 (no 5s),<br/>3136/3125 (no 3s) -- in theory, there&apos;s even a &quot;2-less&quot; interval which also<br/>vanishes but we exclude this as we want to use an equivalence interval of<br/>2/1. As we know, tempering out 81/80 suggests approximating 5/4 by 4 fifths minus 2 octaves.<br/>Then, tempering out 59049/57344 suggests approximating 7/4 by 10 fifths minus 5 octaves. Finally, tempering out 3136/3125 gives you a major second as a generator, of which there are two for approximating 5/4 and five for approximating 7/4. From this, you can spot that tempering out 126/125 and 225/224 at a time gives you a 7-limit version of meantone where the 7/4 approximation is represented by an augmented sixth.</p><p>&gt; Question 2: how are boundaries between temperament classes worked out?</p><p>Most probably, I think, by finding MOS scales. For example, you can get 7-tone diatonic (5+2) both in meantone and in mavila, with the exception that they&apos;re 5 large + 2 small in meantone and 5 small + 2 large in mavila. Because of this, 7-equal can work both as meantone and as mavila. Similarly, you can get 12-tone chromatic (5+7) both in schismatic and in meantone, with the exception that they&apos;re 5 large + 7 small in schismatic and 7 large + 5 small in meantone. Therefore, 12-equal can work both as schismatic and as meantone. But you won&apos;t get mavila in 12-equal or schismatic in 7-equal.</p><p>&gt; Question 3: is there a simple way to calculate the largest MOS scale for a<br/>&gt; given temperament class?</p><p>What do you mean? There isn&apos;t any limit on how large your scale is. For example, hanson makes a MOS with 11 tones, 15, 19, 34, 53, 72, 91 ... The list goes on.</p><p>&gt; Question 4: how complex is the math to calculate a mapping for a<br/>&gt; temperament?</p><p>For finding the mapping from a combination of two EDOs, there are others who can explain how to do this. For finding the mapping from the vanishing interval, a good way is to take the three prime exponents (assuming the target intervals are 2/1, 3/1 and 5/1) and use that as our starting point. If we are interested only in the generator counts and don&apos;t care about the periods, we can discard the exponent for the prime which we use as our equivalence interval, change the sign in one of the two remaining numbers, and put them in reverse order. For example, the exponents for 81/80 are &quot;-4, 4, -1&quot;; so if we discard the first number, change the sign in one of the other two, and swap them, we get &quot;1, 4&quot; or &quot;-1, -4&quot;, which tells us that 1 fifth (plus an octave) approximates 3/1 and 4 fifths approximate 5/1, or that -1 fourth (plus 2 octaves) approximates 3/1 and -4 fourths (plus 4 octaves) approximate 5/1. In cases where their GCD is not 1, we have to divide them by the GCD and use a period of &quot;octave/GCD&quot; instead of a full octave.<br/>If we wish to get the proper generator size (and therefore the full mapping, including the periods), my favorite method is to break the three numbers into two sets in such a way that there&apos;s 0 at the 2nd position in one of them, there&apos;s 0 at the 3rd position one of them, and the number at the 1st position is divisible by the number at the 2nd or second position, respectively. For example, the exponents for 20000/19683 are &quot;-5, 9, 4&quot;, which you can turn into &quot;-9, 9, 0&quot; and &quot;4, 0, 4&quot;. This essentially tells you that 9 fifths should be the same as 4 major tenths, from which you can already figure out an appropriate generator size. Again, in cases where the GCD of the 2nd and 3rd number is not 1, the octave is split and then either the numbers are divided by the GCD (all of them, which makes the first a non-integer) or the second and third number are multiplied by the GCD (which results in a &quot;squared&quot; mapping if the GCD is 2).</p><p>&gt; Question 5: how do you name a temperament that exists on the boundary<br/>&gt; between two temperament classes (i.e. where for a single value of &gt; generator,<br/>&gt; there are two possible mappings of primes that have equal error)?</p><p>Again, there are other people who may have something to say on this.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=90371 href="#90371">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2010 1:38:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Question 1: for a rank-2 temperament, how does one arrive at a generator and period from a pair of commas to be tempered out?</p><p>It&apos;s only a pair of commas in the 7-limit, I&apos;m afraid.

Now, 22/12 = 11/6, and<br/>&gt; 6*&lt;22 35 51 62| - 11*&lt;12 19 28 34| = &lt;0 1 2 2|. 11/6 has a convergent 9/5, and<br/>&gt; 5*&lt;22 35 28 34| - 9*&lt;12 19 28 34| = &lt;2 4 3 4|.</p><p>I understand everything here except the &quot;convergent 9/5&quot;.  What does that mean and where does 9/5 come from?  But I get (I think) why you&apos;re doing these mathematical operations: the vals for the two EDOs are in terms of a single degree of each EDO, and the operations produce vals in terms of the two generators for the temperament.  However, the value of the generators are variable until you &quot;optimize&quot; them; and you must have equations that you use to solve for generators based on given mappings (or some such technique).  Awesome.  This is what I&apos;ve been trying to understand for all these years.</p><p>I see also that by using vals in conjunction with monzos you can figure out how any JI interval is mapped in an equal temperament.  Incredible!  So if you were really bored, you could sit down with your favorite equal temperament and a bunch of JI intervals, figure out which JI intervals map to the same equal temperament intervals, and then work out all the commas that were tempered out.  If you were REALLY bored, that is.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Question 2: how are boundaries between temperament classes worked out?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They aren&apos;t exactly worked out, but certain equal temperaments define natural boundries between temperaments when they belong to both of them. For instance, 12edo is a natural boundry between meantone and garibaldi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Question 3: is there a simple way to calculate the largest MOS scale for a given temperament class?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, because there isn&apos;t one unless you define a precise generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Question 5: how do you name a temperament that exists on the boundary between two temperament classes (i.e. where for a single value of generator, there are two possible mappings of primes that have equal error)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You name it &quot;equal temperament&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Okay, that&apos;s what I *thought*.  I&apos;ve been spending a lot of time with Erv Wilson&apos;s scale tree, and I noticed that for MOS scales which all share the same period, the more notes you have in an MOS scale, the narrower the range of possible generator intervals is for that scale.  For example: take the 7-note MOS scale of LLsLLLs, where you have a generator range from 2-of-5-EDO (2\5 in Andrew Heathwaite&apos;s Notation)  to 3\7.  When you extend all the generators in that range to their next moments of symmetry (i.e. to a 12-note MOS), you see a branching effect: you get a &quot;node&quot; at 5\12 where the 12-note MOS is an equal temperament, and any generator between 2\5 and 5\12 produces an MOS of 5L7s and any generator between 3\7 and 5\12 produces an MOS of 7L5s.  Where there was one scale, there are now 3, 2 of which are unequal and thus can be extended to another (higher) MOS.  This effect continues indefinitely, since there are an infinite number of equal temperaments.  There are also &quot;golden&quot; generators in every range that will NEVER produce an EDO, but will subdivide the period infinitely and unequally, since the ratio of their large-step to their small-step is phi.</p><p>So the question I&apos;ve been plagued with is, where do I draw the line to create a useful taxonomy of MOS scales for use in low-numbered equal temperaments (i.e. 36 or fewer notes per octave)?  Clearly, there are going to be significant musical differences between scales that share low-number moments of symmetry but not higher ones, so I can&apos;t just lump all the 7-note 5L2s scales into one family.  However, when two of these 7-note scales share the same 12-note MOS configuration, they seem to have more in common, musically-speaking.  I mean, 19-EDO and 31-EDO both share the same 12-note &quot;meantone&quot; MOS, making them a bit more &quot;similar&quot; than &quot;different&quot;.  So it occurred to me that maybe branches on the scale tree might have some kind of correspondence with rank-two linear temperaments.</p><p>Now I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s possible to assert that scales which share the same n-note MOS configuration in a given period ALSO share the same prime-m-limit mapping.  I.e., do all the 12-note MOS scales of 5L7s have the same 5-limit mapping, regardless of where the generator falls in the &quot;allowable range&quot;?</p><p>Thoughts?</p></div><h3><a id=90378 href="#90378">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2010 7:59:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &lt;12 19 28 34| and &lt;22 35 51 62|.

You can start with something on the borderline of two 5-limit mappings, like 6/11, and note it is close to 17/31, which is not the best fifth of 31edo.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Okay, I think I&apos;ve answered my own question.  I was trying to figure out if the generator ranges for families of MOS scales would reach 1-to-1 correspondence with the generator ranges for 7-limit temperaments if you defined &quot;families&quot; of MOS scales by sufficiently-large MOS scales (like 22 notes or something).  But now I realize that ranges of generators for linear temperaments rely on an element of harmonic precision, which is by definition absent from MOS scales.  I could take a &quot;fifth&quot; all the way out to 719.9999999...&cent; and produce an MOS scale of 22 notes identical in configuration to one based on 710&cent;, but they&apos;d be in very different temperament classes.  Maybe if I went WAAAAY up to MOS scales of several hundred notes, I&apos;d get enough specificity, but that would defeat the point.</p><p>Alright.  I was hoping for a way to reduce temperament classes to MOS families, but I understand now that that is impossible.  Classifying scales according to MOS properties alone isn&apos;t enough to tell you about the musical qualities of the scale, you have to look at the mapping.  But of course, if you&apos;re only working with equal temperaments of fewer than 37 notes per octave, a &quot;brute force&quot; approach is also possible ;-&gt;.  Maybe there are other ways I can classify scales in my alternative-EDO primer...I really don&apos;t want to overwhelm people with talk of commas, unison vectors, vals, wedgies, etc.</p></div><h3><a id=90383 href="#90383">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2010 11:13:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 14 June 2010 21:55, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Question 1: for a rank-2 temperament, how does one arrive at a generator and period from a pair of commas to be tempered out?</p><p>There are two steps here.

You can use<br/>&gt; both.</p><p>Now this seems to me to be a result of the arbitrariness with which temperament classes are defined.  It seems to me that if you defined a standard of accuracy in mapping a bit differently, it would no longer be possible to say one tuning can work with different mappings, or that a tuning could work worth more mappings than it is currently said to.  This doesn&apos;t really answer my question, because I wanted to know at what point a tuning stops being compatible with a mapping.  Clearly, there must be an error level at which a mapping becomes nonsense, and I want to know what that is.</p><p>&gt; If you want to draw boundaries, I don&apos;t see any problems with<br/>&gt; following MOS classes.</p><p>I actually DO see a problem with that, though I didn&apos;t until today.  By the current definitions of MOS classes, you can approach an equal temperament with an arbitrary level of closeness and still technically remain within a given MOS class.  Consider the LLsLLLs &quot;diatonic&quot; scale where L = 239.6 cents and s = 1 cent.  The average human couldn&apos;t distinguish that from 5-EDO, but it&apos;s still &quot;technically&quot; within the diatonic MOS class.  Even extending it out to a 22-note MOS, it still behaves more like 5-EDO than 22-EDO.  You need a much more complex system of classifying MOS scales to avoid such nonsense, and at the level of complexity necessary for that, it would be more pedagogically-efficient to take a &quot;brute force&quot; approach EDO-by-EDO or else teach linear temperament theory (math, jargon, and all).  MOS classes are much more complex that I ever realized, and I actually think linear temperaments are simpler and more useful (if a bit vague on the boundary issue).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Question 5: how do you name a temperament that exists on the boundary between two temperament classes (i.e. where for a single value of generator, there are two possible mappings of primes that have equal error)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has a rank one lower than the classes it&apos;s on the boundary between.</p><p>I figured as much...it&apos;s like being one branch closer to the root on Wilson&apos;s scale tree.  But it still doesn&apos;t help with a taxonomic scheme.  That&apos;s really where I&apos;m stuck: coming up with a logical, systematic, and intuitive taxonomy of scales that lets me group MOS scales in various EDOs that have similar musical properties, which I can define without recourse to commas, unison vectors, wedgies, and such; and that I can &quot;name&quot; without having to dig through the archives of this list to explain &quot;why&quot; it&apos;s called something.  I mean, you guys have been about as unsystematic as possible coming up with linear temperament names...sometimes it&apos;s a pun on the generator (&quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Amity&quot;), sometimes it&apos;s a reference to an ethnic scale that the temperament approximates (&quot;Pelogic&quot;, &quot;Mavila&quot;, &quot;Mohajira&quot;), sometimes it&apos;s based on the degrees of some EDO that provides an optimal generator (&quot;Orwell&quot; [19\84], &quot;Beatles&quot; [19\64]), sometimes it&apos;s someone&apos;s name (&quot;Blackwood&quot;, &quot;Hanson&quot;), sometimes it&apos;s named for an interval (&quot;Kleismic&quot;, &quot;Schismic&quot;), sometimes it&apos;s historical (&quot;Meantone&quot;), and sometimes I don&apos;t even know where it came from (&quot;Beep&quot;, &quot;Bug&quot;, &quot;Injera&quot;, &quot;Ripple&quot;).  I mean, keeping those names straight is a challenge!  Not that it&apos;s any less arbitrary than how biologists do it, and not that I have a better solution...but the thought of trying to *teach* this stuff to one of my musician-friends is ridiculous.</p><p>This is why I&apos;ve been bugging you all: I want to know how to draw boundaries so I can lay out all the scales with &quot;manageable&quot; numbers of notes (i.e. the scales that function as scales and not gamuts/superscales) and figure out a systematic way of grouping and naming them, to make it easier to teach people how to use alternative equal temperaments.  My attempts to do this according to MOS configuration failed, because the MOS method groups scales together which have drastically different musical properties.

The mediant between 7/12 and 3/5 is 10/17, R = 3, defining the boundry between regular and irregular.</p><p>One could theoretically create more groups by increasing the subdivisions in the Minkowski &quot;?&quot; form, and then combine selectively to form a group defined by (say) 4L/5&lt;s&lt;L/2, and another group as L/2&lt;s&lt;L/5.</p><p>Right; the next step in the process would be dividing at the mediant between 4/7 and 11/19, which is 15/26, and which has an R value of 4/3, and another division between 11/19 and 7/12, the mediant there being 18/31, and the R-value being 5/3, and so forth.</p><p> These groups will all have a one-to-one correspondence with sections of the scale tree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So basically, it looks like to avoid the problem of MOS scales getting arbitrarily close to a low-numbered EDO, I can just &quot;prune&quot; the scale-tree of all the branches that get to close to an EDO.  Oh my goodness.  This is incredible!  And so SIMPLE!</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what revelation has just struck you, but if you want total trouble avoidance you can always set R to be the golden ratio.</p><p>&gt; Thank you, Gene!  One further question, though: in your above taxonomy, what would you call scales where x = 7/12, or 11/19, or 10/17?  Answer me that, and my problem is SOLVED!!</p><p>I dunno. 7/12 is the boundry between proper and improper, and Rothenberg calls that non-strict proper, but you could call it semiproper. 11/19 is the boundry between lumpy and smooth, so maybe it&apos;s semilumpy, and 10/17 is semiregular.</p></div><h3><a id=90410 href="#90410">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2010 4:48:48 PM</span><button style="float: right;

One approach is that you could plot<br/>your music on the JI lattice, maybe using certain approximations, and<br/>then convert it to a temperament.  That seems to be what Carl&apos;s<br/>talking about but I don&apos;t know anybody who works like that.</p><p>The more notes, yes, the more it&apos;s the odd limit (or whatever) that<br/>drives the melodic structure.  Any extended 7-limit system will let<br/>you divide a 7:8 into 14:15:16, for example, although it&apos;s only in<br/>Marvel temperaments that the two resulting steps are equal.</p><p>The scales I use, generally no more than 24 notes to the octave, do<br/>restrict the melody.  Magic (19&amp;22) does have neutral thirds, but<br/>there&apos;s only one on my keyboard.  Dividing a fifth into two neutral<br/>thirds requires a lot of notes in Magic.  But in Miracle (31&amp;41) it&apos;s<br/>very simple.  So if you like a lot of neutral thirds you&apos;re more<br/>likely to start with Miracle.  If you want to base everything on<br/>neutral thirds, you end up with Mohajira of course, which can be<br/>defined by a mapping.</p><p>Orwell (22&amp;31) could be used for different reasons.  Because of the 9<br/>note MOS (which I noticed two of you have used as a subset of an equal<br/>temperament), because it gives 11-limit harmony simply but<br/>comprehensibly, or because it mixes 7-limit harmony with unequal<br/>neutral thirds.  There&apos;s no point making generalizations about how it<br/>is used because the fact is it&apos;s barely being used at all.</p><p>What I have done is written music for Magic temperament but adapted it<br/>to general Marvel temperament.  The melodies I chose were still guided<br/>by Magic, though.</p><p>&gt; Well, this isn&apos;t exactly about what *I* prefer aesthetically...I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want to import my bias against &quot;traditional&quot; consonance<br/>&gt; into the primer I&apos;m writing. &nbsp;However, I&apos;m dealing with a lot of<br/>&gt; EDOs wherein traditional consonance is impossible, so in<br/>&gt; that sense, yes, melodic properties are probably more important.</p><p>The consonances you map don&apos;t have to be traditional.  Any equal<br/>temperament that isn&apos;t ridiculously small will approximate some<br/>intervals or other.  If you look for scales that approximate those<br/>same intervals you&apos;ll probably end up back where you started.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=90426 href="#90426">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2010 4:58:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote (responding to Graham):</p><p>&gt; Well, that lost me right quick.
