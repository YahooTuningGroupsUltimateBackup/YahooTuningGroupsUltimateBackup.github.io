I wouldn&apos;t say they exploited the comma, only that they exploited<br/>&gt; the dissonance of the Pythagorean thirds, not knowing that future<br/>&gt; generations would use the just thirds only a comma away as consonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 1400s, when the latter were introduced, composers did exploit the<br/>&gt; felicitous closeness of the Pythagorean comma to the syntonic comma, in<br/>&gt; order to get quasi-just thirds out of Pythagorean tuning. In other words,<br/>&gt; they exploited the schisma.</p><p>Hi Paul Erlich!</p><p>I have a short question for you...  If the C-E interval in Pythagorean<br/>is 81:80, or 408 cents and the E# a &quot;comma&quot; away resulting from a fifth<br/>down from the Pythagorean comma B# is HIGHER... then how can it be a<br/>&quot;pure&quot; ratio, since the just third a SYNTONIC comma away from the<br/>Pythagorean third would have to be SMALLER... by 22 cents...  wouldn&apos;t<br/>make it more a D#... or am I getting totally confused...</p><p>_________ ____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2000 1:25:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph,</p><p>The note in Pythagorean tuning that approximates a just major third<br/>above C is Dx (D double-sharp), not E#.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
