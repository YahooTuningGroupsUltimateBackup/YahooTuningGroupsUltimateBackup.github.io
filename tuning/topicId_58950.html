But you also need the quarter-tone accidentals for the rest of the pitches adjacent to the natural/sharped/flattened ones, as I will demonstrate below.</p><p>  &grave;&grave;It appears that nothing other than dense meantone ETs with a<br/>  generator of ~698 cents suffice for the job.&apos;&apos;</p><p>  So what&apos;s a dense meantone et?</p><p>Dense, as in, meantones with high pitch resolution above and including 43tET.</p><p>  &grave;&grave;This means that East and West may musically converge without<br/>  perceptual barriers at long last. For a better representation, 67tET<br/>  (which I notice is not claimed or used by anyone yet according to<br/>  &grave;Monzopedia&grave;) is even better with a 43tET mapping.&apos;&apos;</p><p>  Now it gets confusing. That is a good enough 5-limit meantone, but in<br/>  the 7-limit one might want to use a different version of septimal<br/>  meantone, with an otonal tetrad given by C:E:G:G### rather than<br/>  C:E:G:A#. Is this the mapping you&apos;d use? You also skipped over 55; how<br/>  does that work for Maquam music?</p><p>Why, on second thought, I think 55 is much better than 67. I shall use then 55tET on my Qanun, since it is also very good in 29-limit. Considering its advantages, its closeness to 53, its historical foundations, and ease of adaptability to the 9-comma per whole-tone way of thinking, I find strong arguments in favor of 55. Then, the mapping would be close to that of 31tET, a perfect representation of Maqam Music perdes:</p><p> 0:          1/1                  C          unison, perfect prime  (Rast)<br/>  1:         21.818 cents    C+    Dbb<br/>  2:         43.636 cents    C+    Dbb<br/>  3:         65.455 cents    C#    Ddb<br/>  4:         87.273 cents    C#    Ddb<br/>  5:        109.091 cents   C#+  Db<br/>  6:        130.909 cents   C#+  Db<br/>  7:        152.727 cents   Cx    Dd<br/>  8:        174.545 cents   Cx    Dd<br/>  9:        196.364 cents    D                 (Dugah)<br/> 10:        218.182 cents   D+   Ebb<br/> 11:        240.000 cents   D+   Ebb<br/> 12:        261.818 cents   D#   Edb<br/> 13:        283.636 cents   D#   Edb<br/> 14:        305.455 cents   D#+ Eb<br/> 15:        327.273 cents   D#+ Eb<br/> 16:        349.091 cents   Dx   Ed<br/> 17:        370.909 cents   Dx   Ed      (Segah)<br/> 18:        392.727 cents   E               (Segah)<br/> 19:        414.545 cents   E+   Fb<br/> 20:        436.364 cents   E+   Fb<br/> 21:        458.182 cents   E#   Fd<br/> 22:        480.000 cents   E#   Fd<br/> 23:        501.818 cents   F                (Chargah)<br/> 24:        523.636 cents   F+   Gbb<br/> 25:        545.455 cents   F+   Gbb<br/> 26:        567.273 cents   F#   Gdb<br/> 27:        589.091 cents   F#   Gdb<br/> 28:        610.909 cents   F#+ Gb       (Saba)<br/> 29:        632.727 cents   F#+ Gb       (Saba)<br/> 30:        654.545 cents   Fx   Gd<br/> 31:        676.364 cents   Fx   Gd<br/> 32:        698.182 cents   G               (Neva)<br/> 33:        720.000 cents   G+   Abb<br/> 34:        741.818 cents   G+   Abb<br/> 35:        763.636 cents   G#   Adb<br/> 36:        785.455 cents   G#   Adb<br/> 37:        807.273 cents   G#+ Ab<br/> 38:        829.091 cents   G#+ Ab<br/> 39:        850.909 cents   Gx   Ad        (Hisar)<br/> 40:        872.727 cents   Gx   Ad        (Hisar)<br/> 41:        894.545 cents   A                 (Huseini)<br/> 42:        916.364 cents   A+    Bbb<br/> 43:        938.182 cents   A+    Bbb<br/> 44:        960.000 cents   A#    Bdb<br/> 45:        981.818 cents   A#    Bdb<br/> 46:       1003.636 cents   A#+ Bb<br/> 47:       1025.455 cents   A#+ Bb<br/> 48:       1047.273 cents   Ax   Bd<br/> 49:       1069.091 cents   Ax   Bd      (Evdj)<br/> 50:       1090.909 cents   B               (Evdj)<br/> 51:       1112.727 cents   B+   Cb<br/> 52:       1134.545 cents   B+   Cb<br/> 53:       1156.364 cents   B#   Cd<br/> 54:       1178.182 cents   B#   Cd<br/> 55:          2/1                  C          octave    (Gerdaniye)</p><p>Then the otonal tetrad can be represented either way with just a single A#.

Why not this 79 tone well-temperament with two consecutive generator fifths? The notation would be none other than that of 79tET, and that is why I have been constantly referring to it that way.

Why, that would amount to hundreds of pitches that no one would know what to do with at a glance. Besides, the notation should be feasible, compact, comprehensible.</p><p>I will, of course, indicate all Maqams one by one with their specific ratios, but require a high-cardinality ET or near-ET notation to express them all.
