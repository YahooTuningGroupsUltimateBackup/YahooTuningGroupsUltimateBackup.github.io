Been working with Ethno2 quite a bit, most interesting to me is its nature as a sampling synthesizer for new musics. I think it is superb in this way. And, I&apos;ve been testing how it works with acoustic recording, an acid test for any synthesizer or sampler, for I have found that over the years that any pheaux-phat, that bloated &quot;wow&quot; sound that&apos;s so easy to do in digital, just vanishes into a distant whimper when mixed with acoustic recording, unless the acoustic recording is digitally processed to the point of becoming itself a synthetic performance. The Ethno2 is doing great, its sound quality is solid.</p><p>There&apos;s have been many interesting posts here recently, have to catch up!</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2010 1:27:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another little tune using MOTU Ethno2:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dl.kibla.org/dl.php?filename=FrogAndCobra_BobroEthno2demo.mp3">http://dl.kibla.org/dl.php?filename=FrogAndCobra_BobroEthno2demo.mp3</a></p><p>There are a few musicians around these parts I would pay money<br/>to hear an album of their music of, and you are one of them.</p><p>The sounds here are fantastic.

Very trippy and balanced and resolved to the point even those who don&apos;t like the style almost must admit it&apos;s very musical and imaginative...nice work!</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Fri, June 4, 2010 3:27:03 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Frog and Cobra Ethno2 demo</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another little tune using MOTU Ethno2:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dl.kibla.org/dl.php?filename=FrogAndCobra_BobroEthno2demo.mp3">http://dl.kibla.org/dl.php?filename=FrogAndCobra_BobroEthno2demo.mp3</a></p><p>There are a few musicians around these parts I would pay money<br/>to hear an album of their music of, and you are one of them.</p><p>The sounds here are fantastic.
