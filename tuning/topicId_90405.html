This made it easier to play xenharmonic tetrads on the upper four strings.  You could also try something like DABbFGD, which will let you easily play full 6-note chords.  It&apos;s kinda weird for scales, though.  Another option is to use a tuning based on the flatter fourth (1 degree below the perfect fourth), using an augmented fourth between the 3rd and 2nd string instead of a major third (i.e. 0-464.52-929.03-1393.54-1935.48-2400&cent;).  This is basically 13-EDO standard tuning, I never tried it in 31-EDO but it should make it easier to play various xenharmonic chords.</p><p>HTH!</p><p>-igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just got back from Bonnaroo, and it was an awesome show.
