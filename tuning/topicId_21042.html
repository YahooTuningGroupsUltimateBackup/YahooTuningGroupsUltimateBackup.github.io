We<br/>separate in the same manner notes and intervals but you talk always<br/>concretely about intervals while my concept of musical interval is much<br/>more abstract. I could develop on that later. I will try here only to<br/>distinguish our respective paradigms so the simple words questions could be<br/>settled.</p><p>---------------</p><p>You wrote :</p><p>&lt;&lt; Pitch height doesn&apos;t have to be measured in Hertz. It can be measured in<br/>cents, or as a ratio relative to an arbitrary tonic. It is in the latter<br/>sense that I understand your &quot;widths&quot;. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I understand better why you tend to identify your pitch heights and my<br/>widths. The main difficulty is not here but the slight ambiguity here don&apos;t<br/>help.</p><p>Pitch heights have strictly to be measured with a frequency standard even<br/>if a pitch height is perfectly pointed out by dyads (width, pitch height<br/>reference) and (ratio, pitch height reference). It makes no sense to ask<br/>what is the cents value of the international &quot;LA&quot; whose measure in Hz is 440.</p><p>However I have to admit your use of the term &quot;measure&quot; in a weak sense<br/>since it is a current usage in acoustics. So the term decibel is used to<br/>&quot;measure&quot; (level of) intensities while strictly it is purely a log (ratio).<br/>It is then assumed (but maybe forget by some of its users) that the decibel<br/>value has to be refered to the standard threshold 10^-16 watt/cm^2 to<br/>obtain a true measure.</p><p>As an help to avoid misinterpretation I would like underline here that I<br/>don&apos;t tolerate in my works this type on ambiguities. What is admissible in<br/>the acoustical paradigm would become a serious flaw in the relational<br/>paradigm where all stands on definitions.</p><p>You may understand &quot;widths&quot; in the sense you did but you have not to<br/>understand my use of &quot;width&quot; in that sense for I don&apos;t understand or use it<br/>in that sense.</p><p>---------------</p><p>You wrote</p><p>&lt;&lt; If you&apos;re always measuring the interval upwards from the<br/>   tonic, then all you&apos;re doing is characterizing the pitch-height<br/>   (or pitch-class, which is pitch-height modulo 2) of a tone. &gt;&gt;</p><p>&quot;Pitch-height modulo 2&quot; is not a well-defined object. If P1 and P2 are<br/>pitch heights, it makes no sense to write P1+P2 or P1*P2. A fortiori, it<br/>makes no sense to write P1 or P2 modulo 2 since the modulo definition<br/>implies a composition law. That shows why I cannot tolerate ambiguities in<br/>relational paradigm.</p><p>Forgetting that remark you&apos;re absolutely right : if I was always measuring<br/>the interval upwards from the tonic . . . but I am never measuring the<br/>interval upwards from the tonic . . . (thus simply characterizing<br/>pitch-heights).</p><p>It is an interpretation to see scales composed with tones in sense of pitch<br/>heights where I show modes composed with &quot;tons&quot; in sense of intervals<br/>modulo 2.</p><p>There exist an enormous difference between your scales and my modes. Since<br/>the difference is the same with your chords and my chords I begin with that<br/>to show the difference between the objects within the acoustical paradigm<br/>and the similar objects within the relational paradigm.</p><p>In your sense, if you have 3 tones &lt;t1 t2 t3&gt; such that</p><p>   t1:t2:t3 = 4:5:6</p><p>then you have a major chord. The ratio 4:5:6 is also synonynous with the<br/>major quality of a chord in relational paradigm. However the existence<br/>itself of a such chord requires much more than 3 elements having the ratio<br/>4:5:6.</p><p>In the relational paradigm an object like a chord exist within a finite set<br/>S of intervals having a partial composition law. If 3 elements &lt;a b c&gt;<br/>exist in S such that a:b:c = 4:5:6 then &lt;a b c&gt; is a chord if and only if<br/>the 7 intervals</p><p>   &lt;1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3&gt;</p><p>exist in S, otherwise &lt;a b c&gt; is called a discordance relatively to S.</p><p>A mode is a much more complex object than a chord. That requires many<br/>axioms while only the first axiom is implied in the chord definition.<br/>However, as with a chord, a mode exists within a finite set of intervals S<br/>(gammoid) and its existence as a mode in S implies much more than the<br/>existence of the intervals figuring in the sequence. For instance, the<br/>blues set</p><p>   &lt;1 7/6 4/3 7/5 3/2 7/4&gt;</p><p>   exists in the set generated by the chord &lt;1 3 5 7&gt;. However<br/>   that&apos;s absolutely not a mode in that set for some intervals<br/>   and relations implied by this mode are missing. I note that<br/>   all intervals are not required as in the chord case and that<br/>   the main relation implied is always the partition in degrees.</p><p>   The blues set is a mode in the minimal gammier &lt;3 5 7 15 21&gt;<br/>   and both a mode and a chord in the complete &lt;3 5 7 15 21 35&gt;.</p><p>If you decide to use concretely gammier modes as scales it remains possible<br/>to add slight static or dynamic corrections depending of your goals, for<br/>there may exist constraints with fixed tuning and also a space of<br/>possibilities outside the constitutive harmonic frame described by the<br/>gammier. It&apos;s there something regarding musicians rather than an explorator<br/>of the articulation between the sensible and intelligible levels in kind of<br/>music where intervals are intensively used.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=21106 href="#21106">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
