In any event, it certainly<br/>appeals to a certain audience: those that don&apos;t like words, a<br/>dramatic sub-text, or any other &apos;program&apos; beyond notes, rhythms, and<br/>harmonies.</p><p>But it certainly has an interesting niche in Partch&apos;s output: after<br/>finally leaving the University of Illinois (area), and having been<br/>discouraged with an increasing lack of support and competant players,<br/>he headed back west, settling in Petaluma. He then decided to write<br/>music that he *knew* could be played but would rely only on himself<br/>and whomever he knew would be dedicated to consummate musical skills.<br/>Petals became a sketch pad that became almost entirely integrated<br/>into the musical fabric of his last large stage work &quot;Delusion of the<br/>Fury&quot;.</p><p>Petals was first recorded (or at least started) in the converted<br/>chick hatchery / studio, and the tapes that I have in the Partch<br/>archives bear witness that during the last series of &apos;sessions&apos; they<br/>had to stop at times as the other end of the hatchery was being<br/>demolished!</p><p>It is pretty amazing that he conceived this &apos;piece&apos; among the<br/>instruments, and could probably have played all the parts, although<br/>he used Danlee Mitchell and Michael Ranta for recordings along with<br/>himself. And many people get a great deal of interest from this<br/>piece, but you might want to hear it a couple of times and then<br/>listen to &quot;Delusion&quot;. In only one person&apos;s opinion, it then becomes<br/>an experience similar to listening to piano sketches of... I<br/>dunno... &quot;Boris Gudonov&quot; or something, and then finally hearing the<br/>full opera.</p><p>More than you probably wanted to read about &quot;Petals...&quot;, eh? :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=31626 href="#31626">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2001 8:49:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon and Joseph!!<br/>    I couldn&apos;t with jon&apos;s comments here more.
