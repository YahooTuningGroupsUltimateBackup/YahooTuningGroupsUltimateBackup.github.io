Thank you so much for your interesting commentary.<br/>I would like to take a somewhat &quot;heretical&quot; viewpoint and state that<br/>I don&apos;t believe one&apos;s forms or previous music leads one to a<br/>particular scale at all...except in the most general sense that one<br/>feels a &quot;need&quot; for &quot;something different&quot; from 12-tET due to its<br/>overuse.</p><p>I believe, from my admittedly limited experience, that it goes the<br/>OTHER way.  One is presented with a &quot;given,&quot; a certain scale, a<br/>certain set of conditions or restrictions and THEN one fits one&apos;s<br/>previous musical experiences, both conscious and unconscious into the<br/>&quot;given&quot; framework...</p><p>&gt; 2)How important for you are conscious ideas from previous projects,<br/>themes from previous work or tunings/analyses, and how much do you<br/>&quot;jump off the cliff&quot; when it comes to launching into creation?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Someone who has been composing say 30 years CAN&apos;T really jump off the<br/>cliff.  He&apos;s already off it!  I mean, there is much SUBCONSCIOUS<br/>material and methodology in the gray membrane and it doesn&apos;t go away<br/>so easily!  For those with a bit more &quot;traditional&quot; bent, this is<br/>what, ultimately results in the &quot;style&quot; of the music.  I would like<br/>to think, for example, that my own music would be recognizable in<br/>12-tET, 19-tET, 19-un-edo-just, 6-note hexany, whatever...  Maybe<br/>it&apos;s not true, but I would like to think that!  (Some have said they<br/>find it so...)  However, as I have mentioned before, more<br/>&quot;experimental&quot; composers, such as John Cage like to think they are<br/>starting completely from a tabula rasa every time they sit down to a<br/>blanksheet of music paper, or whatever is being used.  Can they do<br/>that?  I think not, but some wouldn&apos;t ask me for my opinion, or care<br/>what I ventured even if they *DID* hear my opinion.  I&apos;m not<br/>complaining... Why *should* they...?</p><p>&gt; (Through playing music (on Turkish) for Sufi meditation groups in<br/>the mid 70s, it has seemed to me from that point very possible to<br/>create with much less pre-thought).<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s possible to do a whole lot with very little thought.  Most<br/>people do that...  Seriously, though... there is so much subconscious<br/>&quot;stuff&quot; back there, especially if one has been composing for awhile,<br/>that the CONSCIOUS &quot;pre-thought&quot; that you are talking about may not<br/>be as significant as the &quot;pre-thought&quot; that your brain synapses or<br/>whatever remember from your prior composing!</p><p>&gt; 3.  How large of a part does improvisation play in your creative<br/>process, and inform of the qualities of a given tuning system?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Again, improvisation does not necessarily have to be &quot;of the moment.&quot;<br/>Generally speaking, when I am composing, I do not improvise.  I<br/>listen to the scale carefully and then pull &quot;our of the air&quot; as it<br/>were the pitches I want.  I hear them in my HEAD first...  They&apos;re in<br/>there because of all the composing I have done in the past... and I<br/>can readily ADAPT my previous 12-tET work to the new scales... the<br/>thinking just needs to be &quot;adjusted&quot; a bit... and that&apos;s the &quot;fun&quot;<br/>part, since I am so sick and tired of 12-tET...</p><p>___________ ______ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=19297 href="#19297">ðŸ”—</a>shreeswifty &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2001 6:09:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>1.)Why do you choose to stop @ 13 ?<br/>I have a similar vibe but chose to go to 17 for the 17/16 (shankar&apos;s SA)<br/>and then on to 31 for the Major 7<br/>2.)

I would say that I also find great resonance with you in<br/>seeing the full cycle of creation come about. It&apos;s a sort of Creative<br/>Quadernity here: math, sound design, creative direction and the<br/>mysterious spiritual element!</p><p>&gt; QUESTIONS:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1)What is your take on creative work, in particular the process of<br/>initial<br/>&gt; ideas/forms leading to your eventual adoption of a direction,<br/>scale, track<br/>&gt; or album?</p><p>If I answer this in a literal way, I&apos;d say that my musical concepts<br/>can originate from a number of points:</p><p>1.  Inspired by the theory behind the particular scale under<br/>consideration.<br/>2.  Rhythmic concepts. These days my focus has returned to deeper<br/>exploration of prime poly-meters.<br/>3.  Melody, which seems to naturally emanate from a given tuning<br/>system.<br/>4.  Harmonies resulting from melodic simultaneities on different<br/>timbres.<br/>5.  Timbres alone sometimes inspire the direction of a composition. A<br/>good example of this is a piece I&apos;m working on now, with bowed gong<br/>harmonics (will have choir singing in spectra scales).<br/>6.  Wild flights of musical fantasy and conceptual creation. I always<br/>liked Zappa&apos;s &quot;conceptual continuity&quot;, and like to conceive of<br/>unifying concepts for entire suites of compositions.</p><p>If I answer in a less literal way, I have to say that it is entirely<br/>mysterious how it all fuses into the moment of musical creation.<br/>Sometimes I feel varying degrees and proportions of influence over<br/>the direction of compositions and suites, coming from all of the<br/>above basic elements, but it is the ultimate process of how it is all<br/>unified into the final act of music creations, which almost seems to<br/>be going on outside of the control of my conscious mind. I fancy that<br/>the facet of our consciousness which drives the cycle of musical<br/>creation through to its final fulfillment, deals little with the<br/>rational/organizational side. It&apos;s the union of the rational (which<br/>dutifully performs the &quot;dirty&quot; work in a collaboration toward music),<br/>and the &quot;non&quot;-rational, which takes blissful flights from the cliffs,<br/>that makes it all reach the final stages. It&apos;s almost as though there<br/>are complimentary forces at work within ourselves, and the end<br/>product of the union of the creative poles is - music.</p><p>&gt; 2)How important for you are conscious ideas from previous projects,<br/>themes<br/>&gt; from previous work or tunings/analyses, and how much do you &quot;jump<br/>off the<br/>&gt; cliff&quot; when it comes to launching into creation?</p><p>It seems for me, that during each creative phase, something new is<br/>revealed, which always leads into the next area of tuning theory and<br/>musical investigation. The first tunings I ever tried were equal<br/>temperaments (24, 36, 19, 31), which led to just intonations, then<br/>NJNE..etc, now spectral temperaments, which are totally dependent<br/>upon the spectra of the instrumental ensembles used in each<br/>composition.</p><p>Truthfully, I must say that allot of time-consuming planning on the<br/>level of tuning theory, and sound design must happen leading up to<br/>the moment where I can take flight from the cliff tops. But when I<br/>get to this point; where all is tuned and timbres in place for music<br/>creation, I proceed largely without preconceptions. This way I allow<br/>my music making sensibilities to dictate the direction in a way that<br/>my rational mind (the organizer of the magic moment) would not allow.<br/>Whatever it is that &quot;takes over&quot; in the moment - that &quot;inner&quot; ear -<br/>is what seems to reveal the soul of a tuning for me. In a way it&apos;s<br/>laughable to try to speak about the ineffable experience of how one<br/>writes a compelling melody, chord progression or complete music<br/>compositions, but all that it takes before the creation begins<br/>(theory, sound design, etc), totally takes a back seat when it&apos;s time<br/>to play and compose. One must call on other forces for this!</p><p>&gt; (Through playing music (on Turkish) for Sufi meditation groups in<br/>the mid<br/>&gt; 70s, it has seemed to me from that point very possible to create<br/>with much<br/>&gt; less pre-thought).<br/>&gt; 3.  How large of a part does improvisation play in your creative<br/>process,<br/>&gt; and inform of the qualities of a given tuning system?</p><p>This is a very interesting question - almost as if you were thinking<br/>my thoughts!  It is hugely important, and it is from this activity<br/>that the musical nature of scales are revealed for me. For instance,<br/>in a scenario where I am improvising in a JI scale, I may be<br/>accompanied by a harmonic drone (similar in sound and purpose to that<br/>of the tamboura in Indian music), and perhaps a little Bodhran, Tar<br/>or Riq; and when I place the tuning into this multi-dimensional space<br/>where the inspiration of rhythmic motion and timbre come into play,<br/>then it takes on a life and energy all its own.  As above, at this<br/>point there is &quot;less pre-thought&quot; - all of that has happened leading<br/>up to the moment of the improvisation and underlies it. When the muse<br/>speaks though, it is in the language of music and emotions.</p><p>&gt; &quot;The Creative spirit of the list?&quot;</p><p>Absolutely! Our life blood!  We do see fresh fruit being born from<br/>the union of math and music - bliss. I say let&apos;s continue to nurture<br/>the tree!</p><p>&gt; &quot;The Aerodynamics Of Intuition?&quot;</p><p>The fuel for all discovery.</p><p>Thanks for this rare post,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=19464 href="#19464">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/26/2001 6:35:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19290.html#19463">/tuning/topicId_19290.html#19463</a></p><p>Hi Jacky!
