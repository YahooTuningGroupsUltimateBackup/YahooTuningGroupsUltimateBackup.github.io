This further delay comes in the wake of the terrible<br/>earthquake in Gujarat (the state in India whee I come from) which has<br/>caused 40,000 deaths -- and counting -- and has wiped out property<br/>worth trillions of dollars.  That my relatives and friends have been<br/>spared is little consolation.  Thanks.<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/29/2001 8:35:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul (and all), I will post my jottings on shruti, hopefully,<br/>the<br/>&gt; next week.
