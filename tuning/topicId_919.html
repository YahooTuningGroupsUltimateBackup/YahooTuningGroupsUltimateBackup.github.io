I just finished building another guitar, with similar fretting ideas<br/>to Dante, so I add I thought I might add my 2 cents (no pun, really). I<br/>have already a 19 tet guitar that I had fretted by a guy with real skills,<br/>a big instrument with the Rankin fretboards (10 strings on a stick with 40<br/>electromagnetic strings) and a 31 tone, 5 limit electric that I refretted<br/>(with fretlets and traditional fretwire). The last I had to have finished<br/>by a guy with skills, as I had too many buzzing frets and dead notes. I<br/>have also recently built a travel electric (12 tet) with piano wire<br/>(.147&quot;) for fret wire, and a soprano electric fretted with thinner (.026&quot;)<br/>piano wire. Both of the last I cut thin slots with a hand saw and then<br/>crazy glued in the frets. Both of them work quite well, though there are<br/>problems with the thinner wire I will get to in a bit.<br/>&#x9;Recently I have been working on a guitar with the complete Partch tuning<br/>on it. For this one I decided to use thin piano wire (.026&quot;) again, &apos;cuz<br/>the frets are so close together. I worked out the fret placements in<br/>Excel, complete with fretlets and marked out the fretboard. I then cut<br/>slots (previously I had used a fine hand saw) with a Dremel and a small<br/>bit, using a square to keep it straight. I then crazy glued the wire in<br/>place. The thinner piano wire, unfortunately, is always sold as a coil,<br/>and never straightens out easily. So I ended up clamping the wire on both<br/>ends to keep it in place with spring clamps. Occasionally they spring up<br/>and I glue them down again, though that mostly stopped after the first few<br/>days. The biggest problem is that the ends were all quite sharp and the<br/>heights a little uneven (from problems with the grain against the dremel<br/>bit). So I took a file over the whole neck and brought all the frets down<br/>a bit, some ended up with slightly squared tops, but they still play<br/>comfortably and in tune. For the ends I just globbed down some 5 minute<br/>epoxys to cover over the sharp bits. The frets now all work and play very<br/>comfortably. The fret height is very low, but feels fine. It doesn&apos;t look<br/>very pretty but works well, and doesn&apos;t require much in the way of tools<br/>or skills. My biggest problem is just learning how to play the thing, it<br/>takes more accuracy than the fretless instruments I play (oud, fretless<br/>guitar) since the wrong notes are definitely wrong and plenty.</p><p>by the way nice technical notes on your page Dante, very clear.</p></div>
