Basically, I would<br/>request that if modifications are made, the original source be credited<br/>and the modifications indicated.</p><p>In some cases, of course, it might turn out that I was not the original<br/>&quot;source&quot; of the tuning in the first place, given the range of historical<br/>tunings, but that&apos;s another question. The neo-Gothic area seems rather new<br/>to me, but I&apos;m prepared to learn otherwise.</p><p>Also, Keenan Pepper, congratulations on a wonderful neo-Gothic tuning! I&apos;m<br/>tempted myself to call this the &quot;acorn fifth&quot; as an immigrant to the<br/>traditional territory of the Nisenan Nation, where acorns represent a<br/>staple of life. In an immigrant&apos;s very imperfect speech, I might call it<br/>seomthing like _?u:tim ma:wykpajim solim bo:no_, or &quot;Acorn Fifth Song<br/>Design&quot; -- the metaphor of a basket design pattern possibly describing a<br/>musical tuning. How a native speaker would say it is another question.<br/>(If anyone is curious, I could try to explain some of the spelling here,<br/>like &quot;y&quot; for a high central vowel like the IPA &quot;barred-i,&quot; &quot;j&quot; for a glide<br/>like English &quot;y&quot; in &quot;young,&quot; and a &quot;:&quot; for a prolonged vowel.)</p><p>Since it&apos;s your tuning, however, Keenan, the naming choice is<br/>yours. &quot;Acorn Fifth&quot; is just my personal name for it.</p><p>Anyway, this is a really beautiful tuning, one near the lower end of a<br/>rather small region which might be described (in my opinion) as the most<br/>characteristic range of neo-Gothic _temperament_. In another sense,<br/>Pythagorean itself is the &quot;center,&quot; but this is a range where the<br/>tempering process produces some striking &quot;different&quot; results while the<br/>tuning as a whole retains a Pythagorean flavor.</p><p>Your Phi tuning (fifth = ~704.095607 cents) beautifully complements<br/>&quot;Golden Meantone,&quot; and has near neighbors like the following:</p><p>Regular tuning with major third at pure 14:11     -- ~704.376991 cents<br/>E-based regular tuning (Blackwood&apos;s R = ~2.71828) -- ~704.606908 cents</p><p>How fascinating that Fibonacci&apos;s noble Golden Mean, and Euler&apos;s famous e,<br/>can lead to such similar musical results, at the same time each having its<br/>own fine shading and color.</p><p>The special quality of this region, which I first noted in a paper on<br/>&quot;Neo-Gothic tunings and temperaments&quot; around early this July, is that not<br/>only the regular but the &quot;alternative&quot; thirds (augmented seconds,<br/>diminished fourths) have a complex and active quality. We have regular<br/>major and minor third at or near 14:11 and 13:11, and diminished fourths<br/>and augmented seconds at or near 21:17 and 17:14.</p><p>In a medieval style, I term this latter intervals &quot;subditones&quot; (small<br/>major thirds) and &quot;supersemiditones&quot; (large minor thirds). They have a<br/>certain polarity, in contrast to the identical neutral thirds of 17-tet,<br/>and at the same time are quite different from the usual 3-limit and<br/>5-limit thirds alike. As I noted in my paper, they have a complexity and a<br/>certain tension nicely underscoring cadential resolutions -- like the<br/>usual medieval ones, but with a wide chromatic semitone rather than the<br/>usual narrow diatonic one. In this region, the difference is around 50<br/>cents or a bit more.</p><p>Thus the ratio between the chromatic and diatonic semitones, your focus<br/>here, Keenan, has a very direct relevance indeed to the sonorities and<br/>progressions which in my view are among the leading features of thie<br/>particular neck of the neo-Gothic woods.</p><p>Your brilliant Phi counterpoint to Kornerup&apos;s tuning is closer to the<br/>13:11 than the precise-14:11 and e-based tunings, and it yields almost<br/>exactly a 17:14 within something like 0.73 cents. In contrast to the<br/>tunings with slightly larger fifths, it makes the near-17:14 and<br/>near-21:17 a bit more &quot;polarized,&quot; or further from &quot;neutral.&quot; How people<br/>might hear these differences could be an interesting question, and I look<br/>forward to tuning it and trying it out.</p><p>Anyway, the neo-Gothic counterpart of Kornerup&apos;s tuning is something with<br/>a beauty and inventiveness which really amazes me -- something waiting to<br/>be discovered, and how fitting that you were the one to do it.</p><p>It is a great privilege to witness such a sensitive and perceptive<br/>achievement of high mathematics and great art.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with deepest congratulations,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=12636 href="#12636">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2000 8:07:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
