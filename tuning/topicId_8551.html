The pipe sound of the<br/>&gt;enharmonic organ can be synchronized with a akai sampler, on which I have<br/>&gt;several other organ sounds and also reed stops, which can be tuned in the<br/>&gt;same tuning and combined with the live instrument. So, it is not a mixture<br/>&gt;sounding like a reed, but in fact a nice reed! Also the bass of the<br/>&gt;enharmonic organ, which is limited to F1 (midi number) is enlarged by sampler<br/>&gt;sounds. I compose my pieces at home with the Akai using a sequenzer program<br/>&gt;and two manuals with two tunings that differ a quarter tone one from the<br/>&gt;other. When a piece is finished, I am able to make the enharmonic organ play<br/>&gt;it via MIDI and decide, which sounds are added from the Akai It is impossible<br/>&gt;to play such pieces manually (the special manual is till now only suited for<br/>&gt;demonstration purposes and not for polyphonic playing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Best regards for you and the whole group of microtonal composers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hans-Andr&#xFFFD; Stamm<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
