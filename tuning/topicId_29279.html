The neutral-third<br/>temperament has a complexity of 8 in this limit, so two 11-limit-without-7<br/>otonalities exist in the 10 note MOS.  You also get one in Rast, expressed<br/>in this temperament.</p><p>The more complex intervals are, the more they go out of tune as the<br/>generator size drifts from the optimum.  So that would explain what you<br/>say about intervals &quot;reinforcing&quot;.
