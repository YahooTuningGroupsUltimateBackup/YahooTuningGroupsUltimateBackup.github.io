If you have strings tuned to different notes, then you would have<br/>a<br/>&gt; different set of ratios with each string. In effect you would have alot<br/>&gt; more ratios at your disposal. Say  you have a string tuned to what well<br/>&gt; call 1/1 and it has a fret for 5/4 (for example) . If you have another<br/>&gt; string 3/2 to the first string that same fret will make a 15/8 with the<br/>&gt; first string. If you have a string tuned 5/4 to the first, that same fret<br/>&gt; gives 25/16 and a string tuned 16/9 to the first string gives a  10/9. If<br/>&gt; you have a fret that makes a 7-linit ratio with the 1/1 string, say 7/5,<br/>&gt; then the other strings give -21/20, 7/4 and 112/45 (sic). While the 7/4<br/>is<br/>&gt; useful, I wonder about how often the other two would come in handy. So I<br/>&gt; guess you would have to be careful how you tune the strings, or maybe<br/>those<br/>&gt; way out intervals sound cool?</p><p>Well, yes -- you do end up with different sets of ratios on each string,<br/>depending on how you tune the strings to each other.  That&apos;s either a<br/>blessing or a curse, and often both.  Sometimes it is annoying if you&apos;re<br/>trying to play in a particular scale and the only way to get the note<br/>you&apos;re looking for is to jump way up or down somewhere on a different<br/>string.  I have found that some melodies which would be pretty simple on a<br/>more standard guitar can be inhumanly difficult on mine if I want to use<br/>the specific just pitches.</p><p>On the other hand, I like to try different types of things (e.g. 5-limit<br/>diatonic, Archytas enharmonic, harmonic series, Wilson hexanies, etc.) and<br/>when I designed it I didn&apos;t see any point in requiring a specific pitch set<br/>on every string when I didn&apos;t even know what kinds of scales I might want<br/>to explore sometime. I have found that tuning the strings to<br/>1/1-3/2-2/1-8/3-3/1-4/1 gives a pretty flexible set of pitches with low<br/>ratios most of the time (since any ratio is only being multiplied by 3 or<br/>1/3), so it&apos;s good for general purpose playing, and gives reasonable access<br/>to several common scales.  Recently I&apos;ve been playing with the strings<br/>tuned to 2-3-4-5-6-7 harmonic series segment, which gives me at least<br/>marginal fingerings for a few Wilson hexanies and some other weird harmonic<br/>stuff.  So I only see the point of the partial fretlets scheme if you have<br/>a specific pitch set  and string tuning that you want to lock into.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth mentioning that even the bigger-numbered ratios are<br/>certainly consonant with *something*, if not necessarily to 1/1.  (Assuming<br/>low prime limits.)  Your hypothetical 25/16 is consonant to the 5/4 and<br/>your 112/45 is consonant to the 16/9, for example.  Not every possible<br/>pitch is always played against the 1/1, so even *if* you wish to avoid<br/>dissonant complex ratios, there is still some context to use any of them in<br/>a consonant way, depending on how you are moving around.  Strangely, when I<br/>am randomly improvising I often find myself semi-consciously calculating<br/>the ratios between notes in anticipation of what might sound good.  It is<br/>surprising how instinctive this can become.</p><p>&gt; With partial frets, especially ones that are only one string wide, you<br/>have<br/>&gt; to be careful about pulling the string off the edge of the fret, but its<br/>&gt; not really a problem.</p><p>I suppose it depends on what type of music you&apos;re trying to play...</p><p>kp</p></div><h3><a id=884 href="#884">ðŸ”—</a>bram &#x3C;bram@gawth.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/1999 9:19:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have some questions about guitars in general.</p><p>Is there any particular reason why guitar strings are generally placed<br/>strictly in order of descending pitch?

The bridge adjustment can be approximated by a slanted,<br/>straight piece if the open-string pitches are more or less monotonic.  But<br/>that&apos;s a secondary concern I suppose.</p><p>   If you have a completely consistent interval between the strings, as you<br/>would on a violin or mandolin (P5), or most of the strings of a guitar (P4),<br/>it&apos;s a little easier to transpose fingering patterns of various scales and<br/>chords.</p></div>
