But I think of &quot;microtonal&quot; as having the most general meaning, for<br/>two reasons:</p><p>1) In popular discourse (or as popular as discourse on tuning gets)<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; means &quot;unconventionally tuned&quot;.  And &quot;conventionally tuned&quot;<br/>means 12-equal.  If I ask a salesperson whether a particular instrument<br/>can be retuned, they will point me to the absolute tuning function.  If I<br/>ask them if it supports xenharmonic scales, they will look at me blankly.<br/> What I want is what they call a microtonal scale.</p><p>2) I think &quot;microtones&quot; should be very small intervals, smaller than a<br/>quartertone.  Microtonality is the observation that these intervals are<br/>musically meaningful, even if it&apos;s only the difference between the<br/>interval you get and the interval you expect.  Most people expect<br/>12-equal.</p><p>Both arguments lead to a definition relative to 12-equal.  This seems<br/>completely appropriate to the world I live in.  When most instruments and<br/>a lot of theorists implicitly assume one particular tuning, it is useful<br/>to have a word for everything else.  Yes, this is culturally biased, but<br/>I think that&apos;s unavoidable.</p><p>I even think &quot;microtonal&quot; can be more general than &quot;xenharmonic&quot;.<br/>Meantone temperament requires a microtonal tuning table, but doesn&apos;t sound<br/>strange.  Even neutral third scales can be surprisingly un-strange.</p><p>I consider the act of using a tuning table to be a defining feature of the<br/>concept of microtonality.  So a tune played by a variable pitch instrument<br/>would become microtonal when copied by a synthesizer.  This means the word<br/>becomes vague and inconsistent, but so do most words if you look at them<br/>closely enough.  Let&apos;s keep on going and pretend we know what we&apos;re<br/>talking about.</p><p>All this said, it&apos;s not a word I use very often.  I try to avoid words<br/>that have been abused so often as to be rendered almost meaningless.<br/>&quot;Western&quot; is another good one.  But I wanted a domain name, and something<br/>to put in the title bar, and &quot;microtonal&quot; seemed the obvious choice.</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/1999 9:51:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Graham Breed:]<br/>&gt;In popular discourse (or as popular as discourse on tuning gets)<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; means &quot;unconventionally tuned&quot;.</p><p>I agree with this... this seems to me to be its generally understood<br/>implied meaning in the &quot;popular lexicon&quot;... also Graham, your<br/>&quot;microtonal means unconventionally tuned&quot; is probably the most<br/>straightforward &quot;definition&quot; I&apos;ve seen pop up yet in this thread.</p><p>&gt;And &quot;conventionally tuned&quot; means 12-equal.</p><p>And of course that&apos;s the rub with the (&quot;microtonal means<br/>unconventionally tuned&quot;) above... But I guess I find this to be less<br/>problematic than some. I use microtonal as it&apos;s generally going to be<br/>understood, but in my own music I tend to say things like, tuning<br/>systems (or intonation systems), as I use (and freely mix) whatever of<br/>the pitch continuum I can seem to make work with no real feel for<br/>inherent hierarchies or implied compromises.</p><p>&gt;2) I think &quot;microtones&quot; should be very small intervals, smaller than<br/>a quartertone.</p><p>Again I agree... and the music that initially sounded most<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; to me was just that.</p><p>&gt;Microtonality is the observation that these intervals are musically<br/>meaningful, even if it&apos;s only the difference between the interval you<br/>get and the interval you expect.</p><p>Again, well put (I think this was also a point Joe Monzo made).</p><p>&gt;Most people expect 12-equal.</p><p>And how... When I first started sending out my &quot;microtonal&quot; tapes for<br/>reviews I didn&apos;t include any information whatsoever about the tunings<br/>(etc.). This was a bit of a hold over from the Maneri&apos;s; that if your<br/>music couldn&apos;t excite and fire people up without any undue<br/>flavor-of-the-month (microtonal) fuss - what&apos;s the point? And I agreed<br/>with this 100% (still do, though I have softened somewhat as I believe<br/>that interested people do enjoy knowing the extra-musical particulars<br/>that interest them, and I suppose that there is always the chance that<br/>others might find something that will make them want to dig in and see<br/>what they can find for themselves). Anyway, though the reviews were<br/>almost always very positive, not a single review (in about a three<br/>year span) made even the slightest of &quot;microtonal&quot; comments... it<br/>simply wasn&apos;t on the menu.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>Fred Reinagel &#x3C;freinagel@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/1999 7:15:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stearns@capecod.net">stearns@capecod.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  [Graham Breed:]<br/>&gt; &gt;Most people expect 12-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [Dan Sterarns}<br/>&gt; And how...</p><p>I beg to differ.

I believe if the average music listener heard a<br/>brass choir play in 12tet, they would say they were out of tune.</p><p>Perhaps your right (but I really only think this would be true if the<br/>music were decidedly tonal, familiar and typical of a brass choir),<br/>but this was not quite what I was trying to get at.</p><p>It has been my experience that darn few (even really *unaverage*<br/>listeners) have much of any sort of an accessible reference that<br/>enables them to say anything other than &quot;that sounds out of tune,&quot; or<br/>that sounds &quot;exotic,&quot; or &quot;weird,&quot; (etc.) when listening to music tuned<br/>outside of a 12e framework... and in truth, very few of them ever seem<br/>to notice at all (or at least this has been my experience)... So I<br/>guess the point I was trying to make was that most people don&apos;t think<br/>of intonation as a drastically mutable option outside of what &quot;sounds&quot;<br/>familiar, and what is typical of whatever they&apos;re used to... so as my<br/>music is hardly ever &quot;diatonic&quot; or &quot;tonal&quot; per say, people have tended<br/>to hear it as some &quot;atonal&quot; variety of the only intonation they would<br/>think of there (12e), and VERY VERY few people have made any<br/>distinction whatsoever between what was tuned to 12e and what was<br/>(often drastically) not.</p><p>I&apos;m not so sure that I&apos;m really explaining any of this very clearly,<br/>but this was what I was trying to get at anyway...</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>gbreed@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/10/1999 6:26:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:944806007.15916@onelist.com">944806007.15916@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>Fred Reinagel wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;  [Graham Breed:]<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Most people expect 12-equal.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  [Dan Sterarns}<br/>&gt;&gt; And how...</p><p>&gt;I beg to differ.

They may notice something was wrong, but I don&apos;t think<br/>they&apos;d realise it was the tuning.</p><p>That one line quote is from a message I wrote a week ago, in digest 418.<br/>In context, I said &quot;Microtonality is the observation that these intervals<br/>[microtones] are musically meaningful, even if it&apos;s only the difference<br/>between the interval you get and the interval you expect.&quot;  I now contend<br/>that the difference between what the choir play, and what a keyboard would<br/>play is not musically meaningful.  They sound different, but would be<br/>heard as the same piece of music.  I deliberately avoided any connection<br/>between microtonality and out-of-tune-ness.</p><p>I also said &quot;a tune played by a variable pitch instrument would become<br/>microtonal when copied by a synthesizer.&quot;  This is a case in point.  If<br/>you programmed a synthesizer to exactly reproduce what the horns were<br/>doing, that would count as microtonality.  For &quot;real instruments&quot; no<br/>reasonably tuned 5-limit music is microtonal, the way I think of it.</p></div>
