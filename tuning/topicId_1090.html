Colors tend to mix to form a composite color, whereas individual<br/>&gt;    frequencies of sound remain distinct.</p><p>Well, different colors can be distinct if presented in different parts<br/>of the visual field. There is a more important difference in how color<br/>and sound are perceived. Essentially, our retinas are lined with<br/>millions of color detectors, which come in only three types. Each has a<br/>very different response curve as a function of frequency. Our brain can<br/>determine the frequency-correlate at each point on the retina by<br/>comparing the magnitude of the responses from the three types of<br/>receptors. That is why we usually need only three primary colors --<br/>mixing different amounts of three widely separated, fixed frequencies<br/>can mimic almost the entire range of responses to one continuously<br/>variable frequency. There is nothing analogous in sound whatsoever.</p><p>&gt;3.  Light travels in straight lines and sound penetrates many objects<br/>&gt;    or flows around them.</p><p>Actually, on small scales light flows around objects (diffraction) and<br/>certainly light penetrates glass. But while sound requires a medium to<br/>propogate, light does not (light is electric and magnetic fields<br/>mutually inducing one another). Electromagntic radiation in the audible<br/>spectrum probably exists in the universe, but that doesn&apos;t mean it has<br/>anything to do with sound (it certainly isn&apos;t audible).</p></div><h3><a id=1160 href="#1160">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

In short,<br/>while the general capacity for language shapes thinking, particular<br/>languages do not. It is rather the user who shapes her own idiolect,<br/>creating the language she needs from innate linguistic structure, an<br/>aquired, parameterized lexicon (which may not correspond to a single,<br/>generally recognized dialect), and individual creativity.</p><p>Now, this does not disregard the way in which individuals or societies use<br/>and abuse language as a means of shaping the thinking of others. This kind<br/>of manipulation can be subtle or crass, but this is not a unique property<br/>of a specific language, and it is not isolated to linguistic activities.<br/>Muzac was one attempt to do just this, and the Chinese tone for well-being,<br/>mentioned earlier on this list,  was another.</p></div><h3><a id=1242 href="#1242">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/1999 11:37:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Actually, on small scales light flows around objects (diffraction)</p><p>   From what I recall of my EM Theory class from many years ago, this is<br/>related to frequency.  Radio waves can diffract around buildings up to a<br/>point, but light can barely do so at all.  I can&apos;t recall for sure how that<br/>process worked, but it would not surprise me if there is an analogous<br/>effect applying to sound waves that might help explain why they can<br/>diffract around objects fairly easily too (or easier than light anyway!).</p></div><h3><a id=1243 href="#1243">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/1999 11:41:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;Also, it would seem that two sources of the same color -- say, yellow<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt;could be out of phase by 180 degrees and add by cancelling each other<br/>&gt; out,<br/>&gt; &gt;as seems to be possible with two sound sources.  But I never heard of<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt;happening, either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It happens very often in the optics lab -- that&apos;s why you get<br/>&gt; interference fringes if you pass a laser through a double slit.</p><p>   This is the basis of interferometry, which is being used for many<br/>purposes, including (shortly) in an attempt to detect gravity waves.  I<br/>remember doing a lab back at UT to measure the index of refraction of<br/>various gasses by interferometry.   The trick though is that you have to<br/>have a coherent source of light, like a laser.</p></div>
