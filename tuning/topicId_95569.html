My first<br/>(recurring) question for all of these is what do the fifths look like (all<br/>possible fifths within a 2 octave span)?  Not that impure fifths are bad...it&apos;s<br/>just the I find by ear limited areas around 3/2 and/or 22/15 and 11/7 actually<br/>work well in the 5th-low 6th range.</p><p>     There looks to be (about) a nice 22/16 diminished fifth between 8/5 and<br/>75/64...and between 128/75 and 5/4....and a couple of perhaps overly stretched<br/>5ths around 1.517.</p><p>    The stretched fifths are about the most &quot;evil&quot; thing I can find in this<br/>scale...it actually looks GREAT to me at first glance!  Plus it has somewhat<br/>constant intervals (minus those revolving around the 22/15)...looks no worse<br/>than my Dimension^2 scale in a whole lot of ways to be honest...and maybe better<br/>in others. :-)   Gene...what are, in your opinion, the worst dyads in this<br/>scale?  I can&apos;t the anything really bad in here so far....</p><p>Overall...looks generally excellent to me...</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Thu, January 13, 2011 1:19:35 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Minerva[12]</p><p>The usual good scale stuff for hobbits: strictly proper, low mean variety.<br/>Tuning the transversal in orwell gives a related 12-note orwell scale.</p><p>! minvera12.scl<br/>Minvera[12] (99/98&amp;176/175) 11-limit hobbit, POTE tuning<br/>12<br/>!<br/>113.18260<br/>226.36520<br/>273.37552<br/>386.55812<br/>499.74073<br/>587.07667<br/>700.25927<br/>813.44188<br/>926.62448<br/>973.63480<br/>1086.81740<br/>1200.00000<br/>!<br/>!! preminerva12.scl<br/>!
