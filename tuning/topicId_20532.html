I use<br/>technique books (in painting and music) and<br/>even stock my CD collection with &apos;educational<br/>recordings&apos; as jumping off points. I&apos;m probably<br/>the only one who knows how those items relate<br/>to an actual piece of work. The neat thing is<br/>that each of us CAN take the same road and<br/>arrive at different destinations.</p><p>Regarding shmounterpoint and  Lennie Tristano,<br/>I think he had a pretty good thing happenning<br/>(not like the Swingles at all and pretty far<br/>from the other West Coast Cool sounds). But I<br/>find the incidental counterpoint between<br/>simultaneous jazz soloists, or jazz bass<br/>and soloist, or in some African field<br/>recordings to more interesting.</p><p>The problem with the &apos;rules&apos; is that they are<br/>statistical in nature, and the things that<br/>happen most of the time are less interesting<br/>than the sudden &apos;gotcha&apos;. In music, and<br/>especially counterpoint, I refer to these<br/>gotchas as collisions. One reason why Bachs<br/>music stands out in my opinion is that he left<br/>so many of the gotchas in and seemed to savor<br/>them. When two melodies follow their own<br/>independent logic and create a logic in their<br/>simultanieties, it&apos;s magic. When the logic of<br/>the melodies and simultanieities doesn&apos;t match<br/>in a usual manner and or a collision occurs,<br/>the profundity can be increased. Same road,<br/>different destinations. The soundness of<br/>melodic logic is arguably more important than<br/>the soundness of the logic of their<br/>simultanieies. This is why polytonality works.<br/>Of course, a lot of choral music shows the<br/>exact opposite to be true.</p><p>Sorry, minor brain eruption there.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=20554 href="#20554">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2001 8:58:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert!<br/>    The neat thing also is how we can take different roads and arrive at he same destination.
