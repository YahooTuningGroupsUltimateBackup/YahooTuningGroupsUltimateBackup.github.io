Your presentation was very<br/>engaging, as well as having a certain mathematical humor, and helping me<br/>to see the humor of my own predicament.</p><p>My problem, as you nicely showed, was that I was looking only at the<br/>problem of dividing a near-5:4 major third into two &quot;mean-tones,&quot;<br/>without asking about the _source_ of those mean-tones, namely fifths.</p><p>Of all people, I should be aware that two fifths make a major ninth,<br/>having focused on the 4:6:9 sonority in medieval music for around 20<br/>years. I&apos;m likewise aware, for example, that one of the complications<br/>of a 7:4 is that it can&apos;t be divided into two concordant fourths,<br/>unlike 16:9. In Xeno-Gothic, one uses two intervals a Pythagorean<br/>comma apart, a ~7:4 for special cadences where a narrow minor seventh<br/>contracts to a fifth, and 16:9 for a 9:12:16. An interval like the<br/>22-tet minor seventh is precisely a meantone compromise, filling both<br/>roles -- and, the point of your superb presentation, involves<br/>compromising _the fourths themselves_!</p><p>That was the critical point I missed, getting all caught up in,<br/>&quot;Here&apos;s a solution to the syntonic diatonic-style complication of<br/>53-tet as 5-limit -- just make the scale twice as large, so that the<br/>~5:4 major third is a nice even number of steps.&quot; The point is that to<br/>emulate meantone, we need to emulate _tempering the fifth by<br/>1/4-comma_, just as you show.</p><p>Of course, this means that (as in a usual Renaissance meantone) the<br/>fifths will indeed be compromised -- the usual virtually-pure fifth of<br/>53-tet (or, in this case, 212-tet) will be 1/4 of a 53-tet step<br/>narrower than pure -- thus four times as many steps needed to bring<br/>about this tempering.</p><p>Curiously, I sometimes tend to use &quot;meantone&quot; in a much more general<br/>sense to mean any regular tuning or temperament, with 53-tet thus an<br/>instance of &quot;1/315-comma meantone.&quot; Taken as a &quot;meantone&quot; in that<br/>sense, of course, 53-tet succeeds without any problem &lt;grin&gt;. Since<br/>the scale has an odd number of steps, the &quot;mean-tone&quot; (9 steps) must<br/>also have an odd number, so that as you show they will add up to a<br/>major ninth evenly divisible into two fifths. Likewise, with 22-tet,<br/>the &quot;mean-tone&quot; (in a Pythagorean interpretation) of 4 steps has an<br/>even number of steps.</p><p>Anyway, your presentation was great teaching and made me aware that<br/>the topic of emulating tempered meantones with scales such as<br/>multiples of 53-tet can be more complicated than I might have<br/>guessed. Also, I learned that a successful division of one interval<br/>(the 106-tet ~5:4 into two equal major seconds) does not a tested<br/>system make.</p><p>While I could wish I had been more cautious in testing my 106-tet<br/>solution before proposing it here, I treasure your correction as a<br/>wonderful piece of music theory literature and also a jumping-off<br/>point for your discussion of 212-tet and 76-tet with many rich<br/>themes.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
