It<br/>was written in 1944 in New York City and received only a partial performance<br/>by the AFMM in 1987 in Merkin Hall.  Sandberg devoted his life to setting the<br/>Bible in a polymicrotonal glove which allowed for 16ths-of-tones up to<br/>thirdtones and quartertones.  The text is in Hebrew and comes directly from<br/>the Psalms of David.</p><p>The Unanswered Question posed by American great Charles Ives in 1908 is heard<br/>in an alternate form, suggested by the composer.  The English horn, played<br/>here by Robert Ingliss, is the soloist rather than the familiar trumpet, and<br/>the woodwind choir is more diverse.  Equally significant is the extended<br/>Pythagorean tuning used for the performance: it finally distinguishes a C#<br/>from a Db.  Ives had always insisted that a C# is higher in pitch than a Db,<br/>and that a B# is an eighthtone higher than a C.  This is possible by<br/>spiraling the perfect fifths through 2 octaves.</p><p>Middle-earth for orchestra composed by AFMM director Johnny Reinhard is a<br/>polymicrotonal composition embracing several different tuning combinations in<br/>order to better bring to life the vivid creatures in J.R.R. Tolkien&apos;s &quot;Lord<br/>of the Ring&quot; series.  In addition to a Hobbits movement, there are Khaz&#xFFFD;d<br/>(the Dwarves), Mordor (Trolls and Orcs), and Eldarin (High Elves), each in<br/>different tunings responsive to Tolkien&apos;s characters.</p><p>Rocker and virtuoso electric just intonation guitarist Jon Catler premieres<br/>his Meet The Composer sponsored orchestral work, Evolution.  The orchestra<br/>resonates a stasis of rich harmonic content drawn from the heights of the<br/>overtone series, while soloists ripple through.</p><p>Alyssa Ryvers pitches a tri-dimensional brew in Hologram which uniquely<br/>fractures the sound continuum and is scored for 3 piccolos, 3 bassoons,<br/>clarinet in A, trumpet in C, English horn, French horn, trombone, tuba, and<br/>strings.</p><p>Maestro Bellomia, originally from Rome, now living in Ottawa, commissioned<br/>Montrealer Luc Marcel to create Mod&#xFFFD;le 312 for 11 virtuoso microtonalists,<br/>one instrument to a part. The titled is derived from having sought the<br/>perfect model, citing &quot;eureka&quot; only on the 312th attempt.</p><p>The orchestra for this concert features members of the AFMM Ensemble which<br/>highlights keyboardist Joshua Pierce, violinist Tom Chiu, clarinetist Michiyo<br/>Suzuki, hornist Greg Evans, violist Anastasia Solberg, bassist Mathew<br/>Fieldes, and bassoonist Johnny Reinhard.</p></div><h3><a id=4836 href="#4836">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/14/1999 2:23:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gee, the tilde did me in again.

Ives wanted sharps higher<br/>than flats. He states in his Memos on the Concord Sonata that B# is an<br/>1/8th tone higher than C.&quot; And that he believed this to imply an<br/>extended Pythagorean intonation. I responded that I seemed to remember<br/>(from reading the &quot;Memos&quot; several centuries ago), and feel that there<br/>was more (From say his personal anagogic proclivities, ideas, and<br/>convictions on the one hand, to say the more prosaic areas of his<br/>actual compositional use of modulation, polytonality, and etc. on the<br/>other.) to these spellings than the inert possibilities of unrealized<br/>intonation. (Though there are of course plenty of possibilities well<br/>worth investigating there as well.)</p><p>While I&apos;ve been waiting for the S.Yarmouth library to track me down a<br/>version of the &quot;Memos,&quot; so I can hopefully get a better informed take<br/>on all of this, I&apos;ve been reading Jan Swafford&apos;s &quot;A Life with Music,&quot;<br/>in which I came across the following in a footnote (page 449, note<br/>42): &quot;...Griggs was dubious about equal temperament, the standard<br/>system of tuning since Beethoven&apos;s time. This may have influenced<br/>Ives&apos;s later, often baffling, sometimes infuriating eccentricities in<br/>the spelling of chromatic lines and chords. Though A# and Bb are the<br/>same key on the piano, for example, Ives argued that in some<br/>metaphysical but significant way they are not the same note even in<br/>atonal music. He also looked at sharps as innately stronger (because<br/>they tend tonally to lead upwards), flats as weaker (because they tend<br/>to lead downward). These ideas about spelling make a modicum of sense<br/>in other instruments, especially strings, which do make adjustments<br/>between flats and sharps - a violinist will tend instinctively to play<br/>a sharp a little higher than the enharmonic flat. But none of that<br/>applies to piano.&quot;</p><p>While I have no idea to what degree (the author and composer) Jan<br/>Swafford is really interested in (or knowledgeable of) the ins and<br/>outs of intonation, I feel pretty confident that it would be less so<br/>than Johnny Reinhard... and yet reading this only seemed to strengthen<br/>my initial feeling (suspicion) that when Johnny writes (referencing an<br/>AFMM performance of &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot;): &quot;...the whole score is<br/>being done in an extended Pythagorean tuning. It seems to me this is<br/>the basis of Ives&apos;s conceptual imagination...&quot; he&apos;s probably<br/>overstating the case.</p><p>However, this is not to say that a version of the Concord or the<br/>Unanswered Question in an extended Pythagorean tuning, performed by<br/>people exceptionally well versed in handling alternate intonations, is<br/>not something that I&apos;m dying to hear - because I for one certainly<br/>am(!)... or that this (extended Pythagorean tuning) might not be an<br/>exceptionally prudent way to bypass what would in all likelihood prove<br/>to be a colossal and very problematic job of sorting assessing and<br/>guessing... or that this isn&apos;t going to be a better informed<br/>improvement on a hodgepodge of a fixed 12e, and (to paraphrase<br/>Swafford) often baffled, and sometimes infuriated performers dealing<br/>with Ives &quot;eccentricities in the spelling of chromatic lines and<br/>chords.&quot;</p><p>What I guess I am trying to say is that the &quot;basis of Ives&apos;s<br/>conceptual imagination&quot; (as it pertains to intonation and those<br/>spellings), just seems to me like a far richer maze and tangle than<br/>any rigidly verbatim extrapolation of a B# agreeing with a 3^12/2^18.</p><p>Anyone else have any thoughts or insights on any of this?</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=4991 href="#4991">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/1999 6:49:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Dan Stearns, TD 325.9]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A couple of digest back there was some discussion of what<br/>&gt; the intonational implications of Charles Ives note spellings<br/>&gt; might be...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard wrote: &quot;It seems that Charles Ives envisioned<br/>&gt; an extended Pythagorean tuning for his music.

For a survey see<br/>Allen Forte, &quot;Ives and Atonality.&quot; Notwithstanding Forte&apos;s basic<br/>position that &quot;the major part of [Ives&apos;s] mature output can be<br/>described as atonal&quot; (162), one should add some qualifications. For<br/>one thing, many of those same pieces could as well be described as<br/>*not* atonal; as Forte notes (163), &quot;melodic lines in Ives tend to be<br/>diatonic, chromatic, or whole tone.&quot; Ives&apos;s attitude to the matter is,<br/>as with much else, hard to pin down. But we should remember that for<br/>musicians today the word &quot;atonal&quot; carries a good deal of technical and<br/>polemical baggage, most of which has little to do with Ives. When he<br/>was writing his music Ives did not know the word. He was aware of the<br/>concept, in his own terms. As Ives says in the _Memos_ (56), he wrote<br/>&quot;In the Cage&quot; (1906) &quot;to show that a song dose not necessarily have to<br/>be in any one key to make musical sense.&quot; (He added sarcastically,<br/>from the perspective of the 1930s, &quot;To make music in no particular key<br/>has a nice name nowadays--&apos;atonality.&apos;&quot; The melodic line of &quot;In the<br/>Cage,&quot; however, is whole tone.) The difficulty of placing atonality<br/>and polytonality in Ives&apos;s music is a subset of defining atonality or<br/>polytonality at all. Hidenmith in _A Composer&apos;s World_ denies even the<br/>possibility of atonality, because a given sonority can always be<br/>related to a central tone. Polytonality can be reasoned out of<br/>existence in the same way. In the direction of addressing these<br/>issues, a few points may be made. First, there are what we might call<br/>an &quot;atonal sound&quot; and a &quot;polytonal sound,&quot; which experienced listeners<br/>recognize. The &quot;atonal sound&quot; defies definition; it is complex and<br/>subjective, though nonetheless real. Ives sounds that way only<br/>occasionally, partly because, as Forte says, Ives&apos;s leading lines are<br/>rarely atonal. When Ives does exhibit an &quot;atonal sound,&quot; as in the<br/>_Tone Roads_, he seems less Ivesian than, in that case, prophetic of<br/>the sound of 1960s music. Similarly, some of the first movement of the<br/>Second Quartet arguably sounds as Schoenbergian as Ivesian. The<br/>&quot;polytonal sound&quot; is simpler, a matter of emphasized cross-relations<br/>between lines or strata. Examples include some of Milhaud&apos;s relatively<br/>early and lusciously polytonal works such as _Les Choephores_. As<br/>detailed earlier, Ives explored overtly polytonal effects in some of<br/>his _Psalms_. Soon, however, his polytonality tended to become so<br/>dense that the cross-relations melt into a general sense of chromatic,<br/>perhaps &quot;atonal&quot; texture. At the beginning of the &quot;_Saint-Gaudens_,&quot;<br/>for example, the string lines can be seen as polytonal--perhaps E<br/>minor above A minor, with chromatics obscuring both. The total effect,<br/>however, could be called near-atonal, except that the repeated A-C<br/>ostinato in the basses tends to create a tonal anchor. There are times<br/>certainly--as in much of the Second Quartet--when the lines take<br/>precedence and the harmony more or less takes care of itself (though<br/>the quartet is intentionally steadily dissonant). Adding up all these<br/>effects, one arrives at a few rules of thumb: Achieving atonality as<br/>such was rarely a systematic goal of Ives&apos;s, in the way it was with<br/>Schoenberg and his followers. Though Ives used what amounts to<br/>twelve-tone lines here and there, he showed no favoritism for such<br/>lines; they are a technical device equal among many. Nor did Ives<br/>develop the kind of systematic procedures for avoiding tonality that<br/>the Europeans did--notably the rhetoric of constantly leaping lines,<br/>nonstop dissonance, banishment of triads, and so on. No matter how<br/>leaping, chromatic, or dissonant Ives got, he still usually saw things<br/>as combinations of keys and/or as eventually related to or aiming at<br/>tonality--even if he never quite arrived at that tonality. (The idea<br/>of an implicit but never-actually-achieved tonal center would be<br/>highly Ivesian. He sometimes explained his idiosyncratic note<br/>spellings, for example, with reference to leading tones that never<br/>actually lead.) Meanwhile the presence of diatonic tonality in most of<br/>his music, however veiled, helped him shift readily between atonal and<br/>diatonic effects.&quot; (Jan Swafford, _A Life with Music_.
