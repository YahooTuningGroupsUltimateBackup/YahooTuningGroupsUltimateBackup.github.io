He was<br/>an American original.<br/>Thanks also to Dan Stearns for acknowledgement of the news.<br/>Peace to Mr Fahey and his extraordinary muses.<br/>Lawrence</p><p>&gt;   Date: Tue, 27 Feb 2001 16:08:05 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: <a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a><br/>&gt;Subject: Re: John Fahey</p><p>&gt;&gt; I guess I&apos;ll remember this as being the year in which Xenakis<br/>&gt;&gt; *and* John Fahey passed away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks for forwarding this sad information. Not only was John Fahey a<br/>&gt;wonderful human to have had with us, but it was a great surprise to<br/>&gt;see Gregory Taylor&apos;s name again. He was a member of this tuning list<br/>&gt;in the old Mills College days, and never was there a pair of ears<br/>&gt;more open, fingers-for-typing more eloquent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I miss them both, in different ways...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Best,<br/>&gt;Jon</p></div>
