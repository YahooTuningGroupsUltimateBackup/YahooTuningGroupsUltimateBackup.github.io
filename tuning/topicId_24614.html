Apparently meantone lasted longer in<br/>Catholic areas than in Protestant ones.  Indeed, well-temperament<br/>was considered in Germany to be a hallmark of separation in<br/>ecclesiastical music.  (I found this once on a webpage about<br/>someone connected with Werckmeister... can&apos;t find it now.<br/>Johnny?  This was right after I met with you in December and<br/>we discussed this stuff.)</p><p>And don&apos;t forget about the numerous intonational experiments<br/>in England during the mid-to-late 1800s (Woolhouse, Bosanquet,<br/>Brown, Perrett, Thompson... hmmm... I think one of them might<br/>actually have been American...).  While many of them focussed<br/>on EDOs, most of those were chosen because of their similarities<br/>to meantones.</p><p>And finally, as late as 1905, Mahler lamented to Schoenberg<br/>that &quot;it&apos;s too bad we&apos;ve gotten rid of meantone... we&apos;ve lost<br/>a lot of harmonic possibilities&quot;.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
