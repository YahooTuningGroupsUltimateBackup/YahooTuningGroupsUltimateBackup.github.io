If the subject matter is for a couple of people with a particular interest, cool.

No question.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so you don&apos;t hear the upper note move down in any sense?<br/>[No, I do not hear any lowering of anything. Only a clean rise of the<br/>tenth alone, and nothing else. It&apos;s the only change I hear in the<br/>whole example.
