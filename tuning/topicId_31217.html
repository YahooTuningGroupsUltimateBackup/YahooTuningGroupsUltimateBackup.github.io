It comes from the Greek for<br/>&quot;remainder&quot; -- what remains in a diatonic tetrachord when you take 4:3<br/>fourth (~498.04 cents) and subtract the two 9:8 whole-tone steps of<br/>~203.91 cents each, together adding up to a ditone or major third of<br/>81:64 (~407.82 cents). That is, it&apos;s the difference between a fourth<br/>and a major third.</p><p>More generally, the term &quot;limma&quot; tends to imply for me that the<br/>diatonic semitone is the smaller of the two semitones, as in<br/>&quot;positive tunings&quot; where the fifth is larger than 700 cents. The large<br/>chromatic semitone is then called an apotome -- in Pythagorean,<br/>2187:2048 (~113.69 cents).</p><p>What may be happening with the &quot;large limma&quot; term for 27:25 is that,<br/>by analogy, it&apos;s the &quot;large diatonic semitone&quot; of a 5-limit system,<br/>where the diatonic semitones are _larger_ than the chromatic ones.</p><p>Specifically, if we take C-D as a large 5-limit tone at 9:8 (the same<br/>size as all regular tones in Pythagorean), and the chromatic semitone<br/>F-F# as 25:24 (the difference between A-C at 6:5 and A-C# at 5:4),<br/>then the &quot;remainder&quot; C#-D will be 27:25, or about 133.24 cents.</p><p>Thus in this case, C#-D is indeed the &quot;remainder&quot; or &quot;difference&quot;<br/>between the fourth A-D and the 5:4 major third A-C# -- except that, if<br/>not adjusted, the pitches A-D here don&apos;t form a perfect fourth at 4:3,<br/>but rather an interval a syntonic comma of 81:80 wider (~21.51 cents),<br/>or 27:20.</p><p>What I&apos;d guess is that limma is taken here as meaning &quot;diatonic<br/>semitone,&quot; a category which does C#-D -- the larger such semitone, in<br/>contrast to the 16:15 semitone which does define the &quot;remainder&quot;<br/>between a 4:3 fourth and 5:4 major third.</p><p>By the way, a semitone of around 133 cents can be very pleasing in a<br/>neo-Gothic kind of setting also, where some regular temperaments have<br/>chromatic semitones near this size. It&apos;s also a type of semitone<br/>available in certain schemes with two chains of fifths a given<br/>distance apart.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=31287 href="#31287">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 6:27:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_31270.html#31270">/tuning/topicId_31270.html#31270</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Joe Pehrson, and maybe I can give some reply to two<br/>&gt; questions you&apos;ve raised in recent threads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, from reading Mark Lindley, it&apos;s my understanding that viols<br/>are typically fretted more or less for 12 equal semitones to the<br/>octave,but with a good deal of leeway for adjusting each note -- a<br/>kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;adaptive tuning.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lindley remarks that any Renaissance viol ensemble or the like with<br/>a fair degree of skill can achieve some near-just sonorities, and<br/>&gt; suggests that in the 17th century, a skillful violist (for example<br/>in France) could accord well with a meantone keyboard.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much, Margo, for helping me with this....
