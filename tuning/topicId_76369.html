<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Scratch scratch scratch</h1><h3>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2008 9:50:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I see from my most recent drive-by reading of the list that that nasty<br/>old incurable pustulating itchy red rash of Bach&apos;s tuning has broken<br/>out again. Mildly entertaining to see Johnny and Brad galloping at<br/>great speed and leveling their lances at one another yet again, Brad<br/>sporting the coat of arms of the Knights of the Holy Squiggles whilst<br/>the goode Sir Johnny rides under the standard of Lord Werkmeister the<br/>3rd. Funny, actually, how each seems equally assured of his own<br/>victory, though they go about it in slightly different ways. Also<br/>amusing to read the cheers and jeers of the onlookers, of which,<br/>having wandered into town as I sometimes do of a Sunday afternoon, I<br/>count myself among.</p><p>Don&apos;t know who it was who did so, but to call Brad &quot;insane&quot; is a bit<br/>over the top. If anything, he could be accused of a bit of puffery,<br/>saying as he does in his on-line bio that he &quot;discovered Bach&apos;s<br/>tuning&quot;. T&apos;would be much more reasonable and becoming to state that he<br/>has proposed a reasonable hypothetical solution to the problem. His<br/>&quot;evidence&quot;, i.e. Bach&apos;s music, is no evidence at all, since last time<br/>I looked there was no temperament indication in any of the works. What<br/>Brad finds sounds nice is no more than that, of course, a dead horse<br/>we&apos;ve all whipped many times over. Ditto for what Johnny finds nice on<br/>his ear. Problem is we all live in a musical environment of ET, and<br/>grew up hearing it from Day One, even though many of us in our adult<br/>lives have made it our habit to avoid it like the plague. Try as we<br/>might to deny it, this simple fact has made us somewhat immune to its<br/>sound regardless of how much we may now decry its foulness, a state of<br/>aural preconditioning which was most definitely NOT exist for<br/>musicians of Bach&apos;s time. Thus those who claim our modern appraisals<br/>of sonic quality are irrelevant to historic practice are certainly<br/>arguing from an intellectually superior position.</p><p>Johnny never seems to tire of throwing great fistfuls of apple seeds<br/>in the form vast unsupported sweeping statements, such as how<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s ideas &quot;were all the rage&quot; or claiming to know the<br/>content of Bach&apos;s personal library, as if the presence of a book on<br/>the shelves indicates absolute agreement with all therein, which is a<br/>ridiculous assertion on the face of it (I have many books which<br/>contain both wheat and chaff). I also like the way he conveniently<br/>sidesteps other historical assertions, such as Werckmeister&apos;s own<br/>condemnation of the hideous and lame sound of 1/4 comma fifths -<br/>squirm and dance and bend and twist as one may, the simple historical<br/>fact is that this condemnation exists, and one cannot but wonder if<br/>Bach also had this book on his shelf, having seen that it, too, had<br/>been on the Best Seller list since it&apos;s publication in 1698, the<br/>writings of W being &quot;all the rage&quot; as they were, and if so, why he<br/>leaned toward vintage rage over more modern rage. Rage must be like<br/>single malt, or a good wine, I guess. I also wonder as to Johnny&apos;s<br/>experience in the broader world of contemporary music making, what<br/>with the statement, &quot;That&apos;s why we work so hard to deliver the highest<br/>quality performances in a concert laboratory.  The de facto condition<br/>is almost 100% equal temperament for Bach, which he did not do.&quot;<br/>Frankly, I don&apos;t know ANYONE who uses ET for any Bach, except those<br/>poor unfortunate organists who have no choice in the matter, and the<br/>whole swath of modern instrument musicians who are largely unaware of<br/>any other possibility for any literature. Oh, and there was the<br/>harpsichordist John Gibbons who once sneered at me as I started tuning<br/>that I shouldn&apos;t set any of the &quot;biodegradable&quot; temperaments, because<br/>ET &quot;sounds better&quot;... but that was way back in 1974 or so. Whatever<br/>happened to him, anyway? Seems as though his career sort of, well,<br/>biodegraded back in the mid-1990&apos;s or so.</p><p>All that aside, as someone pointed out, the truth of the matter is<br/>that we&apos;ll never know. Personally, I find the idea rather questionable<br/>that Bach had but one system in mind for all applications, and anyone<br/>with a reasonable familiarity with the literature cannot help but<br/>wonder how much the harpsi was just washboard (as LA harpsichordist<br/>Neil Roberts used to say) and the winds and strings more or less<br/>ignored the keyboard temperament, playing intervals more according to<br/>their &quot;proper proportions&quot;, exactly as Rameau says it should be done.<br/>But this won&apos;t satisfy the ax grinders none.</p><p>Me, I think the shoe temperament sounds much better than the gourd,<br/>but I would consider the spoon as a possibility as well.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>M.

Go figure.</p><p>This debate isn&apos;t exactly new, either -- IIRC Stokowski took a lot of heat for his transcriptions of Bach. But it seems like far more liberties are accepted with the music of J.S. Bach than are accepted for Telemann, Rameau, Handel, or Vivaldi. Stokowski&apos;s interpretations of Bach will survive, while I&apos;m not at all certain about Sir Hamilton Harty&apos;s version of the &quot;Water Music&quot; or performances of the Vivaldi concertos for sopranino recorder on a modern piccolo. :)</p></div>
