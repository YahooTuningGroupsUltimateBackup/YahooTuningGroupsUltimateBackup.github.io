It&apos;s good to see you active on the list of late, and I warmly<br/>welcome interaction.</p><p>This is a great story!</p><p>It brings to mind the story of the Buddha, who was transmitting his<br/>teaching to a large crowd of monks, and only held a lotus petal in<br/>his hand saying nothing.</p><p>This is where mathematics must run away shrieking like a frightened<br/>pup!</p><p>It makes one ponder the distance at which our rational minds<br/>(mathematical) hits a brick wall, and becomes unable to describe or<br/>perceive the world and the complexities, and paradoxes of existence<br/>which defy being symbolically expressed (as in an incessant<br/>mathematical view of reality, art, life). Human beings can only exist<br/>within extremely narrow parameters allowed by natural borders beyond<br/>their control. As well, they can only experience reality through the<br/>limited sensory mechanisms provided by the force which generates all<br/>things. We can only hear within a limited frequency range, and<br/>perceive all sensations within the limits allowed by the same<br/>governing force.</p><p>When we try the simple test of our consciousness and rational mind<br/>applied our own bodies, something very interesting is revealed. On a<br/>superficial level we can perceive &quot;surface&quot; sensations; like the<br/>control over walking or our hands, but try to turn it inward, and<br/>attempt to grasp the same sensation for the liver, the spleen, or the<br/>marrow in one&apos;s own bones; what one finds, is the gigantic brick wall<br/>appears right there in one&apos;s own body, in a place so local and so<br/>intimately personal - which we would like to think we know better<br/>than any other. This shows us a great example *THE ULTIMATE LIMIT*,<br/>the point at which the human mind can not penetrate beneath the<br/>surface of things. One could argue that the tools of science and<br/>mathematics allow our senses to be extended to allow our perception<br/>of things unseen, and yes we do see a little further with these<br/>perceptual aides, but even the best we&apos;ve got will never explain the<br/>Buddha&apos;s teaching. Science stops were this border is drawn - it is a<br/>cold fact, because it can do nothing to enhance our ability to<br/>perceive, or better yet &quot;understand&quot; the ultimate reality behind the<br/>surfaces we see (Maya). This border will always remain, because<br/>without the benefit of some radical changes in human behaviors with<br/>regard to the destruction of their own nest (and their complete<br/>inability to get along with one another, and slant toward hostility,<br/>power, subjugative control), which would perhaps allow a few more<br/>billion years of fruitful evolution, to perhaps expand our biological<br/>capabilities.</p><p>The mystery of it all is:  The veil will never be removed from the<br/>Goddess&apos; face.  The veil of our perceptions and ability to understand<br/>the ultimate reality behind all being is the true limit through which<br/>we must live our lives.</p><p>When we come face to face with the inescapable Mystery which is the<br/>ground of all being, what lessons do we obtain about how we should<br/>interact with each other and our finite world, within the limited<br/>time we have here? We can easily look out and see that huge portions<br/>of the world are racked in a perpetual hell of war, slavery, torture,<br/>terrorism and subjugation by the power hungry *death-dealing*<br/>political archetypes which consume the life essence of other life<br/>forms, cultures and peoples in a feeding frenzy toward *progress* -<br/>which can only be equated with a kind of blind evil force for mass<br/>suicide/genocide. It&apos;s worth noting here, that I have found North<br/>American Indian artifacts in the soil around where I live ever since<br/>I was a child, yet they have been so efficiently annihilated by the<br/>consuming force, that nothing &quot;living&quot; remains of them - only<br/>artifacts. They where killed off by the evil long ago - a strange<br/>legacy of silence ensues. It makes one take pause to realize that we<br/>are just one moment in a huge continuum, and the life in our bodies<br/>gives us certain opportunities and choices. It is how we harness the<br/>moment which counts.</p><p>In the face of the choices being made in the world, directly<br/>affecting all of our futures, what do we put forth? Do we join in the<br/>destructive &quot;frenzy of hate&quot;, or do we stubbornly and unrelentingly<br/>keep trying to create islands of peace and love for which others may<br/>find a faithful anchor, in a time where brother/sisterhood and<br/>community sprit, is seemingly on it&apos;s way to becoming an extinct<br/>species? To me, it is one of the most important roles for the artists<br/>of 2001.</p><p>I prefer to create Islands,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>P.S.
