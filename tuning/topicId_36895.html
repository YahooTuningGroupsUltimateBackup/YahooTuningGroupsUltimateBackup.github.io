I&apos;ll give them a try. Most Scottish fiddlers I&apos;ve<br/>heard (not including Cape Breton style) appear to have adopted equal<br/>temperament. But the School of Scottish Studies may indeed have<br/>people who&apos;ve studied the older styles.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; danmozell wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know where I can find an analysis of the typical<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches used in various traditional fiddling styles?<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might try emailing the School of Scottish Studies at Edinburgh<br/>University.
