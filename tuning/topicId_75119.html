As anyone who has gone off to live in a<br/>foreign country knows, after a year or two you enter a very bothersome<br/>period where your basic mastery of the new language is pretty good,<br/>but when you find yourself in a party or a pub, you have a terrible<br/>time following the simplest conversations. This is because in a noisy<br/>environment, much of the actual information is masked by the noise,<br/>and you simply cannot hear it. Native speakers have a vast library of<br/>expectation which the brain instantly consults to interpret the<br/>incomplete information which the aural apparatus receives. The same<br/>effect can be duplicated by simply taking a recording of someone<br/>speaking and inserting random snippets of silence. The native speaker<br/>will always have a much higher tolerance for data loss than a<br/>foreigner, precisely because the native brain uses the tool of<br/>expectation to fill in the missing bits. In the case of language, the<br/>mind is usually right, though as everyone nows, even in your own<br/>language, sometimes the process goes amiss under such circumstances.<br/>The important point is that the brain is actively imagining something<br/>which is not perceived. We THINK we hear everything the other person<br/>is saying, but if we could make a recording with microphones placed<br/>next to our ears and then analyze it for actual content, we would find<br/>that much of the audio signal of the person&apos;s voice is simply not there.</p><p>Now it appears that Brad is under the influence of the same mechanism,<br/>and his expectation based upon years of playing Baroque music are so<br/>strong that he is incapable of separating that which his musical<br/>imagination creates inside his own internal musical soundscape and<br/>that which is the objective acoustic reality, perceivable by others<br/>and/or measurable by equipment and/or explainable by acoustic theory.<br/>Difference tones are an example of something which is not measurable<br/>by machines (they don&apos;t show up on spectrograms or FFT, for example),<br/>yet they can be heard by everyone and are readily explainable based on<br/>how the inner ear functions. Brad&apos;s phantom dominant 7 roots, however,<br/>simply have no explanation, not even one he himself can offer expect<br/>that one must be &quot;an expert in 18th century continuo realization&quot; or<br/>that you must &quot;think harmonically&quot;, both of which support my theory<br/>that it is an example of internal elaboration rather than actual<br/>perception. Nor can Brad&apos;s phantom tones be measured, and since nobody<br/>else hear can hear them, the most likely explanation is indeed that of<br/>subjective expectation influencing perception. The same might be said<br/>for Brad&apos;s application of the word &quot;pure&quot; to an interval which is<br/>obviously impure in any normal sense of the word.</p><p>The history of science is of course full of such incidences, and the<br/>fact that the subjects really honestly believe they are perceiving<br/>what they report does not change the fact that they are only being<br/>deluded by their own mind. As the I Ching always says, No Blame.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div>
