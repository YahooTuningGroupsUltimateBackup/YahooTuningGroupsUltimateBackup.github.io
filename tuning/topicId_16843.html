I use stainless steel on<br/>my electrics and silver/nylon on my classical fretless. The<br/>stainless are really bright, but lose their highs more<br/>quickly than nickel. Some folks won&apos;t use round wound on a<br/>fretless because they are afraid they will eat up the<br/>fingerboard, but in my experience a good epoxy or super glue<br/>coating will resist wear, especially if you use a high grade<br/>string with even windings. When the strings have worn a<br/>little into the surface, you can apply a coat of epoxy or<br/>super glue (don&apos;t mix and match!) to touch it up.<br/>&#x9;As far as gauges, it depends on the guitar. If it has a<br/>truss rod, you can use pretty heavy strings, but any<br/>unevenness in the neck will be amplified by greater tension,<br/>and you don&apos;t want to crank the truss rod too hard. I used<br/>to play with a guitarist who used 16-56 on a Gibson ES 250,<br/>and it played really well. I&apos;m sure you could go even<br/>heavier.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
