They will pay you directly through your own Reg Now<br/>account.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2002 6:43:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>For anyone who was wondering what the last post was about:</p><p>FTS is Fractal Tune Smithy - the freeware / shareware<br/>Windows program I wrote, which generates fractal tunes, and also has many<br/>microtonal tuning features. It is used by some members for<br/>microtonal work.</p><p>You can find out more about it from<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>Reg Now is the on-line shop that sells FTS, and many other shareware<br/>programs.</p><p>Several micrtonal web sites already have links to<br/>FTS. The Affiliate program is a way that you can get a<br/>commission for anyone who finds out about FTS through your<br/>site.</p><p>The link will work as usual, but whenever anyone clicks on it,<br/>it sets a cookie on their machine, which means that later on if<br/>they decide to buy FTS, you will get a commission because they<br/>found about FTS through your site first of all.</p><p>If you are interested in this, join their affiliate program at<br/><a href="http://www.regnow.com/affiliate.html">http://www.regnow.com/affiliate.html</a></p><p>You&apos;ll be sent instructions about how to set it up,<br/>then you can add Fractal Tune Smithy using the<br/>product selector, and you will get a link you<br/>can use to link to FTS.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
