Most people here are into the open exchange of<br/>microtonal theory and even original music, free of charge.</p><p>We might start with why you&apos;re interested in the 12-tone<br/>ultra plus fretting.  If you tell us your goals for your<br/>music, maybe we can recommend you a different one.  Several<br/>members here have developed interesting methods for fretting<br/>the guitar in different tunings.  For example, Dave Keenan<br/>has a method you can read about here:</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf</a></p><p>Catler certainly is a giant in this department, though, and<br/>if you write to him I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he helps you<br/>out.  Maybe something like, &apos;Hey, I&apos;m an aspiring JI guitarist<br/>but can&apos;t afford your neck yet.  I&apos;d like to do it myself.<br/>Could you send me a description of the tuning?&apos;</p><p>Others here may very well have played the ultra plus and<br/>would probably be willing to share their impressions.  You<br/>might try asking about it also on the MMM list</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic">/makemicromusic</a></p><p>which is a spinoff of this list.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=83281 href="#83281">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2009 7:38:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No nothing secret about it Carl.

Basically, I removed<br/>all the frets of the guitar with a soldering iron and a fret puller,<br/>filled them with wood putty, and have been gluing on frets made out of<br/>14 ga half-round nickel silver wire (from<br/><a href="http://wire-sculpture.com/store/">http://wire-sculpture.com/store/</a>, it&apos;s used to make jewelry) with<br/>cyanoacrylate. One advantage is I can tune each interval for each<br/>string against a reference tone by placing the fretlet under the<br/>string. The disadvantage is that this process is somewhat time<br/>consuming. Nonetheless, I look forward to doing this on another guitar<br/>that so that I can use what I&apos;ve learned to produce more professional<br/>results (for a number of reasons, including the fact you can see the<br/>12EDO fretlines, and the fretlines from when I failed to fret it in<br/>19EDO: this is the ugliest guitar I&apos;ve ever seen).</p><p>The frets seem pretty secure with a rosewood fretboard, although they<br/>can be easily pulled off with pliars. I also might recommend 16 or 20<br/>ga wire if you have very close frets (although my 22-cent syntonic<br/>commas are playable in 1st position--haven&apos;t fretted higher positions<br/>yet.) I think this method would probably work if you weren&apos;t<br/>exclusively using per-string fretlets, but I haven&apos;t tried it yet. The<br/>glued-on frets might also be problematic if you&apos;re doing a lot of<br/>bending.</p><p>Another discovery of mine is you can get pretty much any gauge/tension<br/>of guitar string you can imagine online. My guitar (like Dante&apos;s) is<br/>tuned C2G2C3G3C4G4, and I&apos;m using special order strings for the low C<br/>and the high G from Savarez, with the rest being from a regular<br/>Savarez Corum-Alliance set. Both of the extreme strings sound great<br/>(the low C is almost entirely lacking in fundamental, but it works<br/>great as a solo instrument). For electric I know there are lots of low<br/>gauge strings sold for the metal/detuning crowd, and that the website<br/><a href="http://octave4plus.com">octave4plus.com</a> sells a string designed to be tuned to A440.</p><p>With that said, I don&apos;t think I like the open tuning of my guitar very<br/>much, because it&apos;s too hard to play 3rds on strings tuned a 5th apart.<br/>I also wish the 4/3 of the scale (F) was on an open note. My next<br/>attempt will probably be a just version of standard tuning.</p><p>Good luck,<br/>Cody</p><p>On Tue, Apr 28, 2009 at 11:29 AM, gregkurcewicz@...<br/>&lt;gregkurcewicz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello - I&apos;m glad I found this group.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a new member living in Derbyshire, UK.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve had great interest in Just intonation for many years (particularly the<br/>&gt; works of Tony Conrad and Lamonte Young) and am just at the point where I am<br/>&gt; embarking on making some JI music myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did enquire of Jon Catler recently about one of his 12 tone ultra plus<br/>&gt; necks.
