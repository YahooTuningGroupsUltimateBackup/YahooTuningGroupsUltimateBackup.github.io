One of these that&apos;s consistently been rated highly, yet not much music has been written in it, is orwell, with a generator that splits the perfect fifth into 6 equal parts. One of these days I&apos;d like to get around to writing something in orwell.

The interesting property of these scales is the ratio between the large and small step sizes (the golden ratio, phi). Each large step can be subdivided to produce a new scale (another ring of the horogram) which in turn has the golden ratio between the large and small step sizes. This is an aesthetically pleasing ratio in general and allows any interval to be approximated as closely as you want by increasing the size of the scale. But even better, some of the horograms have good approximations for harmonic intervals in the inner rings without needing to go out too far -- a good example is horogram #9, labeled &quot;Hanson&quot;. The &quot;15&quot; ring already has a very satisfying harmonic sound in addition to the desirable melodic properties.</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/hrgm.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/hrgm.PDF</a></p><p>So, in summary, my top 5 picks:</p><p>Petr Parizek&apos;s 12-tone septimal tuning<br/>Ellis&apos;s Duodene<br/>15-ET<br/>TOP orwell[22]<br/>Wilson&apos;s horogram #9 (&quot;Hanson&quot;)</p><p>Ask me some other day and I&apos;ll probably come up with an entirely different set.</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2009 12:32:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Chris,</p><p>according to the specified values, the period is an octave and the generator<br/>is something over 350 cents.

Some of them:</p><p>- ET closed into octave with 9 to 11 and 13 to 18 notes in the octave, and here especially those near to common 12, like 11 or 13. Here I want to research in which way composer has to change a creative process and force himself to accept new number of notes in the octave where just few notes are missing or are added. It must be totally crazy experience, like if for example some chessmaster tries Japanese chess.</p><p>- tunings with unequal steps which will be constructed by some purely &quot;numerological&quot; attitude, like sine pattern: 50-60-70-80-90-80-70-60-50-40-30-20-10-20-30-40... Cents, or with expanding size, like 10-25-45-70-100-135-175-220-270-325-385-450... or opposite, or similar way. Or to combine two rows with different slope for different melodic direction: 5-10-20-35-55-80-110-145-185-230-280-335-395-460-530-605-685-770-860-955-1055-1160, 1110-1050-980-900-810-710-600-480-350-210-60. There are many possibilities which I find interesting.</p><p>- tunings closed in intervals different from octave, ET or  with unequal steps</p><p>- adaptive JI, where all verticals are JI tuned. This seems to me the most promissing field concerning a paradise of consonancy, but with lot of unanswered questions (or answered? has somebody here some deeper experience with it?or can send a link to some documents about it?).  Here I want to find a way how to tune dissonant chords which don&apos;t follow third structure like harmonic series but different one, and which use up to 12 tones. Another question to solve would be how to deal with horizontal lines, that means melody, or how to tune root notes of chords - to use 12ET or other way? Even when I will limit this shifts from practical reasons to +/- 50 Cents, and use 5 Cents step size, I have 240 possible different tuning steps in octave, which is still too much. Does somebody has different attitude how to work with adaptive JI?</p><p>- and why to use only one tuning in one composition? No reason for it. I want to combine different tunings in one work, be it sequentially or simultaneously.

And, again, Arab music<br/>&gt; uses 12TET + the other 12 notes as non-harmonic &quot;neighboring tones&quot; a lot.<br/>&gt; And, according to Marcel, it seems Turkish music does the same sort of<br/>&gt; thing.   So you can get extra expressiveness easily out of the &quot;extra 12<br/>&gt; tones&quot;, just not of the harmonic variety.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    If there is any cool trick Ives or anyone else uses to get consonant<br/>&gt; chords that can&apos;t be fit into 12TET to work within 24TET, though...I&apos;d be<br/>&gt; eager to see how they get away with it.  From what I&apos;ve seen, agreed...most<br/>&gt; harmonic chords in 24TET come simply from the subsets of 12TET under 24TET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- On *Wed, 2/11/09, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;* wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Musts: Tunings to Compose in Before I Pass?<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Wednesday, February 11, 2009, 1:49 PM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with all due respect, this *is* the 21st century and all notes are fair<br/>&gt; game.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That being said, there was a piece I posted quite a while back and I was<br/>&gt; bedeviled on how to fit a note(s) that was actually a result of using<br/>&gt; quarter tones nicely into the harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://clones">http://clones</a>. soonlabel. com/mp3/quarterp icnic.mp3&lt;<a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/mp3/quarterpicnic.mp3">http://clones.soonlabel.com/mp3/quarterpicnic.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And it certainly is not the case that I have some aversion to dissonance.

Unless, one of you has a clever way to fit those in as well to an &gt; under 30 note tuning.

This is actually really basic stuff.  24TET includes 2 12TET tuning,<br/>&gt; 36TET includes 3 of them erm 2*12 = 24 and 3*12 = 36...and 48TET has 4 sets<br/>&gt; of 12TET in it....get it now?</p><p>Look Michael, I&apos;ll explain what I ment with an example.</p><p>Lets say you play part of an arabic melody that goes like this:<br/>3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1</p><p>Now a defining character of this sequence of notes is the 27/25 between 5/3<br/>and 9/5.<br/>If you play it in 24tet (or 12tet) like this: 700cents 900cents 1000cents<br/>1200cents this character is completely lost.<br/>With melody stepsizes is very important in defining the character.<br/>The 27/25 stepsize is 133.238cents. In 24tet you can best represent this<br/>stepsize with 3 quarter notes making it 150cents.<br/>So the best way to play 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1 in 24tet would be either:<br/>700cents 900cents 1050cents 1200cents<br/>or 700cents 900cents 1050cents 1250cents<br/>now taking the 9/5 to 2/1 stepsize too literally is taking it a bit too far<br/>as it&apos;ll destroy the relation between 5/3 and 2/1 and especially 3/2 and<br/>2/1.<br/>So it&apos;s best to do 700cents 900cents 1050cents 1200cents.</p><p>Now if you decide to play 3/2 5/3 9/5 and then harmonise it by playing 6/5<br/>3/2 9/5 the moment the melody hits 9/5 you have a big problem.<br/>You just made 9/5 1050cents and 3/2 700cents.<br/>Either you play the harmony (a major triad) as something like 350cents<br/>700cents 1050cents. Which is a harmony way more false than 12tet.<br/>Or you play the harmony as 300cents 700cents 1000cents in which case the<br/>1050 of the melody is a quarter note off.<br/>Or you play the harmony as 350cents 750cents 1050cents in which case the<br/>whole harmony is about a quarter note off from JI.<br/>Or you forget all about trying to preserve the charater of the melody and<br/>simply play the melody in 12tet aswell making the 9/5 1000cents and the<br/>harmony 300cents 700cents 1000cents. In which case if you keep this up<br/>you&apos;ll never leave a 12tet subset of 24tet and might aswell simply use 12tet<br/>as you have 12 tones you&apos;ll never play.</p><p>Now to get back to the point:<br/>While 24tet may seem simpler than 53tet, 24tet has a unique set of problems.<br/>Those problems make 24tet harder than 53tet in many ways.<br/>Yes true for 53tet you need better theory or you&apos;ll end up beeing a comma or<br/>several commas alot of the time.<br/>But atleast 53tet is fully capable of playing any music very correct.<br/>So it&apos;s your fault if you mess up. With 24tet you can do everything perfect<br/>yourself and the scale will still mess everything up.<br/>In the end of the day even though you&apos;ll mess up a bit in 53tet I think the<br/>endresult will sound better. And atleast you&apos;ll know it&apos;s you not the scale<br/>that&apos;s messing up if things sound bad.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2009 12:23:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where&apos;s the 1/8th tone?</p><p>It&apos;s easy to see that the maximum error of an equal-step<br/>tuning for an arbitrary dyad target is 1/2 the step size.<br/>And the average error over a large enough set of dyads<br/>is 1/4 the step size.</p><p>But for chords, the dyadic errors can add, up to the full<br/>step size.

But did you have &gt; it tuned right?  It has a fair bit harmonically and plenty &gt; more chords when you extend it up to 22 notes.  I haven&apos;t &gt; done anything with it myself.  If it isn&apos;t close enough for &gt; you, then you can try miracle.<br/>&gt; &gt; I know the 10 note miracle scale, and it&apos;s got some harmony, &gt; but it&apos;s boring melodically.  I have used a pentatonic &gt; subset, though.  (Close to pygmie.scl in the Scala archive.)</p><p>For orwell (named after, but not created by, George Orwell by the way), I&apos;d recommend at least 13 notes, and you&apos;ll probably want the 22-note set for more traditional kinds of harmony. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s something &quot;average Joe&quot; musicians would immediately find much use for -- it takes some playing around with (and a generalized keyboard would help). Miracle is usable with 21 notes, but you really need at least 31 for more traditional progressions.</p><p>Injera is one that might be more accessible. An older name for it is &quot;double diatonic&quot; -- essentially two 6-note scales in meantone-type tuning, a half octave apart. So it&apos;s a 12-note scale, it has some recognizable properties, and yet it goes beyond 12-ET to approximate some 7-limit harmonies.</p><p>From there, you could go on to something like a hanson scale, based on a chain of minor thirds. 19 notes of hanson temperament is a great system, and you can do a lot with just 11 notes. Lecuona&apos;s _Malague&iuml;&iquest;&half;a_ can be played in hanson[11].</p></div><h3>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2009 1:50:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>big agree:</p><p>-marketable: ugh<br/>-Persichetti<br/>-ear<br/>-getting something from any tuning</p><p>On Feb 12, 2009, at 9:27 PM, Herman Miller wrote:</p><p>&gt; Michael Sheiman wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --with all due respect, this *is* the 21st century and all notes are<br/>&gt; &gt; fair ---game.<br/>&gt; &gt; And they are...only with the restriction certain sets of them can be<br/>&gt; &gt; used &quot;at once&quot; IF you want to get a market-able level of &gt; consonance.

And it&apos;s based on one of Wilson&apos;s MOS scales, not JI, meantone, or 12TET.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp; Not saying everything should be markettable but...it would greatly help to spread the good word about microtonal if we could at least have a few outstanding examples that say &quot;microtonal can both sound relaxed like 12TET and have different feel....you can actually, say, play microtonal at a dance party as a DJ and still be respected for it&quot;.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Fri, 2/13/09, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Musts: Tunings to Compose in Before I Pass?<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Friday, February 13, 2009, 1:50 AM</p><p>            big agree:<br/>-marketable: ugh-Persichetti-ear-getting something from any tuning</p><p>On Feb 12, 2009, at 9:27 PM, Herman Miller wrote:<br/>Michael Sheiman wrote:<br/>&gt; --with all due respect, this *is* the 21st century and all notes are&nbsp;<br/>&gt; fair ---game.<br/>&gt; And they are...only with the restriction certain sets of them can be&nbsp;<br/>&gt; used &quot;at once&quot; IF you want to get a market-able level of consonance.
