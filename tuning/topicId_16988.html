Please be patient I&apos;m not advanced as all of<br/>you are in this field. I&apos;m fairly new and still learning the basics.</p><p>My second conversation with Dr. Lochner</p><p>Wally said:</p><p>Hi Dr. Lochner</p><p>     I was amazed by your response. Even though you say your not a<br/>music expert - you probably are! Music is<br/>     all about numbers. You can ignore the musical letters that you<br/>see in written music. Letters are used to simply<br/>     identify frequencies which make writing music down on paper<br/>easier to understand.</p><p>     I&apos;m sure I can find what musical note 545 trillion c.p.s. is<br/>equal to. But what will my answer mean?</p><p>     Any audio frequency &quot;doubled&quot; is the same frequency as the<br/>original only higher. In other words, an audio<br/>     frequency of 100 cps is also the same &quot;sound&quot; as a frequency of<br/>200 cps. If I double 200 cps then 400 cps is<br/>     also the same sound as 200 cps (only higher). Likewise 100 cps,<br/>200 cps, 400 cps, 800 cps, 1600 cps,<br/>     3200 cps etc. are all the same &quot;sound&quot; except they are at<br/>different &quot;pitches&quot; (the highness and lowness of a<br/>     note).</p><p>     As a result, let&apos;s say for example that &quot;reduced&quot;, 545 trillion<br/>cps (the color green) equals &quot;x cps&quot; (maybe you<br/>     can explain to me how to do this). If &quot;x cps&quot; equals an audible<br/>frequency of 628 cycle per seconds. What<br/>     does it mean?</p><p>DOCTOR LOCHNER SAID:</p><p>On your calculator, just keep dividing the 545 trillion by 2 until you<br/>get something in the audible range. (I think you have to divide by 2<br/>about 40 times, and that will give you 495 cps.) I&apos;m not sure what<br/>it means, other than it&apos;s very high pitched.</p><p>WALLY SAID:</p><p>     If I compose a piece of music using an audible frequency of 628<br/>cps more often than not, will the listener have<br/>     a much more intense feeling about the color green as he stands<br/>staring at a green wall?</p><p>DOCTOR LOCHNER SAID:</p><p>This is an interesting question, but I think that&apos;s more a function<br/>of psychology and physiology. So I really don&apos;t know.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=16989 href="#16989">ðŸ”—</a>Walter (Wally) &#x3C;earth7@optonline.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2000 7:44:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My Third conversation with Dr. Lochner</p><p>WALLY SAID:</p><p>     Hi Dr. Lochner</p><p>     Thanks for your time and for helping me with the frequency of<br/>light waves. Could you please tell me<br/>     where/how you arrived at: &quot;The frequency of green light is about<br/>5.45 x 10^14 cps (that&apos;s 545 trillion cps).</p><p>     Questions:<br/>     1) Where did the number 5.45 come from?</p><p>DOCTOR LOCHNER SAID:</p><p>To find the frequency, divide the speed of light by the<br/>wavelength of the light you&apos;re interested in:</p><p>frequency = (speed of light) / wavelength.</p><p>The speed of light is 3x10^8 meters/second. This is always<br/>the same. The wavelength of green light is about 5.5x10^-7 meters.<br/>So for green</p><p>frequency = (3 x 10^8) / (5.5 x 10^-7)<br/>frequency = 5.45 x 10^14 cycles per second</p><p>WALLY SAID:</p><p>     2) Excuse my lack of Keyboard terminology but is 10^14 equal to<br/>10 to the 14th power? If so then 10^14<br/>     equals one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) ??</p><p>DOCTOR LOCHNER SAID:</p><p>Correct: 10^14 means 10 to the 14th. However, you need 14 zeroes to<br/>get to 100 trilliion: 100,000,000,000,000.<br/>Also, 5.5x10^-7 = 0.00000055</p><p>WALLY SAID:</p><p>     3) Is there a web site that you can recommend to me which<br/>explains what the frequencies (c.p.s.) are for the<br/>     visible colors in the electromagnetic spectrum? (besides green)</p><p>DOCTOR LOCHNER SAID:</p><p>Off-hand, I don&apos;t know of any. But just for your reference, red light<br/>has a wavelength of about 6.5x10^-7 meters, yellow light about<br/>6.0x10^-7<br/>meters, and violet light about 4.0x10^-7 meters.</p><p>Jim    END-END-END</p><p>I hope this helped everyone in the tuning group</p><p>Thanks<br/>Wally</p></div><h3><a id=16998 href="#16998">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
