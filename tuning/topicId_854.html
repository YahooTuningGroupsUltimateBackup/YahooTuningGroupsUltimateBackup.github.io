Vina frets bear this out (in order to play the 5/3, it has<br/>to be bent up from the flat Dha). My guess is that this, at least in<br/>Karnatic music,  is due to a higher priority for consistancy between the<br/>tetrachords.  5/3 does sometimes appear, however, in almost always striking<br/>contexts in both traditions, typically as part of a gamaka connecting the<br/>upper octave Sa to Dha.</p><p>Further, in most of the Karnatic ragas with # Ma, it should be 45/32 and<br/>not 64/45.  In spite of the implications of the 72 melakarta scheme,  in<br/>practice, a raga like Kalyani is  tuned as if were a 9/8 disjunction from<br/>Sa to Ri followed by two conjunct tetrachords,</p><p>One of the interesting aspects of Riley&apos;s piece is that -- please correct<br/>me if I&apos;m wrong about this as I haven&apos;t a copy of the recording, which<br/>didn&apos;t do much justice to the piece -- each movement treats a different<br/>pitch as tonic, but I believe that the 1/1 (c#) is never used. This forces<br/>him to do some relatively subtle things.</p><p>That brings me back to a point about minimalism which ought to be made.<br/>Many of the landmark works of early minimalism used as simple a surface<br/>(i.e. the &quot;notes&quot;) as possible in order to make it possible to hear<br/>phenomena that were not normally in the perceptual domain of traditional<br/>concert music.  This required radical shifts in the ways one listened to<br/>music.  In the cases of Young or Lucier, this meant completely abandoning<br/>the traditonal parameterization, while in the case of Tom Johnson, it meant<br/>ignoring the semantic content of the acoustical objects.   It is clear that<br/>many listeners never made those shifts, but that is a matter of individual<br/>preference, and one requiring the strength to go against almost everything<br/>else presented by ones culture.  (Good analogies may be found in the<br/>reception of the visual installations of a Walter De Maria or a Robert<br/>Irwin)   I happen to find it regretable that composers certain composers<br/>would themselves draw the consequence that their success was predicated on<br/>the simplicity or tonality of the surface, and turn to composition that<br/>increasingly represented those predelictions.  This unhappy misreading of<br/>theiry own early practices is sadly an oft-repeated pattern in music<br/>history.</p></div><h3><a id=943 href="#943">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/1999 4:20:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In agreement with Dan Wolf&apos;s post,<br/>concerning Karnatic music,<br/>I&apos;ve always heard Ravi Shankar&apos;s #MA<br/>as clearly 45:32.<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=948 href="#948">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/1999 7:04:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would have to disagree because in fact Shankars Sa is a 17/16 fellas at C#</p><p>Joseph L Monzo wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Joseph L Monzo &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In agreement with Dan Wolf&apos;s post,<br/>&gt; concerning Karnatic music,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always heard Ravi Shankar&apos;s #MA<br/>&gt; as clearly 45:32.<br/>&gt; ___________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>&gt; Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>&gt; or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; We have a new web site! <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

Vina frets bear this out (in order to play the 5/3, it<br/>has<br/>&gt;to be bent up from the flat Dha). My guess is that this, at least in<br/>&gt;Karnatic music,  is due to a higher priority for consistancy between<br/>the<br/>&gt;tetrachords.  5/3 does sometimes appear, however, in almost always<br/>striking<br/>&gt;contexts in both traditions, typically as part of a gamaka connecting<br/>the<br/>&gt;upper octave Sa to Dha.</p><p>&gt;Further, in most of the Karnatic ragas with # Ma, it should be 45/32<br/>and<br/>&gt;not 64/45.  In spite of the implications of the 72 melakarta scheme,<br/>in<br/>&gt;practice, a raga like Kalyani is  tuned as if were a 9/8 disjunction<br/>from<br/>&gt;Sa to Ri followed by two conjunct tetrachords,</p><p>Daniel, we are both correct. I meant that the lattice diagram of the two<br/>scales has the same shape. What I neglected to mention is that the<br/>Riley&apos;s 4/3 is the Indian 1/1. With this proviso, can we say we are in<br/>agreement?</p></div><h3><a id=1004 href="#1004">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/1999 4:54:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Recalling a few of your previous postings, Mr. Pagano, I think you ought to<br/>&gt; think a bit more about the issue of absolute pitches.  Tessitura is indeed<br/>&gt; important, especially for voices and stretrched strings, but the frequency<br/>&gt; numbers themselves have no biological significance, much like the time unit<br/>&gt; used to measure them.  In some settings, particularly with amplification,<br/>&gt; it may be useful to use the key of the local electrical current, but that<br/>&gt; gives no additional meaning to those frequencies.  While some ultra- and<br/>&gt; infra-sonic frequency bands can be used to disturb or damage organic<br/>&gt; functions, to the best of my knowlege the only absolute audio frequency in<br/>&gt; the central musical range that has recognized biological significance is<br/>&gt; that which renders Carlsberg Elefant Bier undrinkable.</p><p>I basically agree with you here except there was a doctor (name lost at<br/>moment) who did research on the resonant frequencies of various viruses and<br/>achieved good results.

You could be sitting on top of  a fortune in the<br/>&apos;wellness&apos; business.  If aroma therapy can make it, why not something with<br/>sound?  I propose that we honor Ivor Darreg and call it Darreg Acoustical<br/>Frequency Therapy, or DAFT for short....</p><p>Seriously, though, I would not be surprised if composite waveforms were<br/>found to have specific neurological effects, but single frequencies,<br/>whether related to biological clocks or resonant frequencies, are probably<br/>going to vary greatly from from individual to individual and then over<br/>time, so we are really talking about frequency bands not single<br/>frequencies*.  I&apos;m out of my league here, but are viruses so uniform in<br/>size that particular strains  have fixed resonance frequencies, or are<br/>these fixed rates of oscillation of some sort?</p><p>DJW</p><p>* A good example of this is to be found on the Lovely Music recording of<br/>Alvin Lucier&apos;s _Music for Solo Performer_, where the two performances (by<br/>Lucier and Pauline Oliveros) have strikingly different alpha wave frequency<br/>ranges.</p></div>
