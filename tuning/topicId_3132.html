It&apos;s been<br/>&apos;completed&apos; by four different people by now (Mazzetti&apos;s version<br/>is the latest and best), and it&apos;s a musical experience that<br/>I, as a serious Mahler fan, would not want to be without.</p><p>The (expensive) score of Cooke&apos;s version (the first one to be<br/>published) clearly distinguishes between what Mahler actually<br/>wrote and what was added by Cooke, and for someone like myself<br/>who&apos;s intimately familiar with Mahler&apos;s sound-universe, it&apos;s<br/>easy to see that the work was virtually complete in his mind,<br/>and I do not look upon it as an experiment or &apos;final sketch<br/>made audible&apos; - I consider the _10th_ to more than hold its own<br/>against the other 9.</p><p>(BTW, Mahler was an inveterate reviser of his symphonies,<br/>making changes to his scores after every rehearsal -  note how<br/>his *ear* was always his final guide.  He never lived to hear<br/>_Das Lied von der Erde_ or the _9th_, let alone the _10th_, and<br/>he was still making changes to the _5th_ during the last months<br/>of his life.  If he had lived longer, I&apos;m sure *all* of his<br/>symphonies would be different today from the versions we know.)</p><p>The point I&apos;m digressing around is that works not officially<br/>published or produced by a composer are frequently very much<br/>worth hearing, either for their own intrinsic value or for<br/>their &apos;filling out&apos; of our picture of that composer.  Who<br/>would argue that Mahler&apos;s _9th_ is not worthy of the concert<br/>hall because of its incompleteness?  No one that I know of.</p><p>This also brings to mind the knowledge we have of Beethoven&apos;s<br/>work habits, because of the survival of his sketchbooks.<br/>(actually, this applies to Mahler too)</p><p>It may be impossible to argue whether or not an artist is the<br/>best judge of his own work, but my personal opinion is: save<br/>everything and let posterity see (and hear) it all.</p><p>Imagine what we&apos;d be able to know about Partch&apos;s work if he<br/>*hadn&apos;t* burned all those old compositions!</p><p>&gt; But if I ever were to want to hear it, it would be on a<br/>&gt; dreadfullyoutoftune bar-room piano, with Tom Waits<br/>&gt; singing/intoning.</p><p>Yes, exactly!<br/>That would be the ideal performance of _Bitter Music_!</p><p>(I never said I was overly fond of Warren Burt&apos;s performance,<br/>altho I&apos;m glad to be able to hear, and not just read, _Bitter<br/>Music_.)</p><p>(Do you know Tom by any chance?  Wonder if he&apos;d be interested...)</p><p>Joseph L.
