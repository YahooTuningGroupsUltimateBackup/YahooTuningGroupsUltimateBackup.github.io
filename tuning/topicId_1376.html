(The number 18 represents the two<br/>&gt; limits added together or 13 + 5.)<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve played around with some numbers and come up with<br/>&gt; this table showing the relative gravitational pull of<br/>&gt; ratios of different limits:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;etc.&gt;</p><p>I haven&apos;t experimented with this to gain any empirical<br/>knowledge myself, but years ago I wrote a computer program<br/>to calculate Partch&apos;s &apos;Field of Attraction&apos; for every<br/>possible chord progression in the 19-Limit Tonality Diamond.<br/>The printout gives the ratios and cents values in roughly<br/>graphical page-layout for both the starting and ending<br/>chords, with the interval size in cents for each &apos;permissible&apos;<br/>resolution.

In the octave-specific case, could the Tenney complexity play<br/>the same role as the odd-limit? Let&apos;s consider first the Farey-based results<br/>such as that displayed at<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/ent_006.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/ent_006.jpg</a>. If we judge the<br/>entropy relative to a baseline that reflects the downward slope of the<br/>Farey-like results, does it agree with the Farey complexity? Perhaps I&apos;ll<br/>have the insight at another time to attempt to judge this rigorously, but<br/>for now I&apos;ll be content with a qualitative assessment. Let&apos;s rank the<br/>simplest ratios in the first two octaves according to the product of<br/>numerator and denominator (up to 105), which is of course the same as<br/>ranking them according to Tenney complexity:</p><p>Ratio     Product<br/>1/1       1<br/>2/1       2<br/>3/1       3<br/>4/1       4<br/>3/2       6<br/>5/2       10<br/>4/3       12<br/>7/2       14<br/>5/3       15<br/>5/4       20<br/>7/3       21<br/>8/3       24<br/>7/4       28<br/>6/5       30<br/>10/3      30<br/>11/3      33<br/>7/5       35<br/>9/4       36<br/>8/5       40<br/>7/6       42<br/>11/4      44<br/>9/5       45<br/>13/4      52<br/>11/5      55<br/>8/7       56<br/>15/4      60<br/>12/5      60<br/>9/7       63<br/>13/5      65<br/>11/6      66<br/>14/5      70<br/>10/7      70<br/>9/8       72<br/>11/7      77<br/>13/6      78<br/>16/5      80<br/>12/7      84<br/>17/5      85<br/>11/8      88<br/>18/5      90<br/>10/9      90<br/>13/7      91<br/>19/5      95<br/>11/9      99<br/>17/6      102<br/>13/8      104<br/>15/7      105</p><p>Lo and behold, this is exactly the list of local minima in the graph, with<br/>one exception -- the minimum marked ***, which is between 17/9 and 15/8,<br/>appears in place of 13/7. But this is exactly the type of behavior we&apos;ve<br/>seen, involving little minima sliding up toward the unison or octave, when N<br/>is too low and the harmonic entropy curve is still converging; and a &quot;bump&quot;<br/>for 13/7 is visible on the graph, but fails to be a minimum due to the<br/>graph&apos;s steep slope.</p><p>Furthermore, the products seem to be a monotonic decreasing function of the<br/>valley depths relative to the overall slope, except that the valleys are an<br/>extra amount deeper the farther to the right you go. This phenomenon, as<br/>well the overall slope of the curve, is due to the diminishing density of<br/>the Farey series as one moves to the right. We&apos;ve seen that for lower N, we<br/>get lower harmonic entropy values, and deeper valleys. As one moves to the<br/>right of these graphs, the &quot;effective N&quot; gets lower, due to the lower<br/>density of the ratios, and so the overall graph lowers, and the depth of the<br/>valley for a given product of numerator and denominator decreases.</p><p>Open questions:</p><p>1. Can we calculate a smooth function that represents (models &amp; explains)<br/>the density of the Farey series as a function of pitch? Can we use some sort<br/>of canonical probability distribution, parameterized by this density, to<br/>represent (model &amp; explain) the overall slope of the harmonic entropy<br/>function of the Farey series?</p><p>2. Can we construct a Farey-like series that also obeys the partial ordering<br/>that Pierre Lamonthe associates with the Stern-Brocot tree, but for which<br/>this overall slope remains flat throughout? If we calculate harmonic entropy<br/>using this series, I expect the local minima to still correspond to some<br/>&quot;limit&quot; on Tenney complexity, but this time the height of the minimum should<br/>correspond to the Tenney complexity for each ratio.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Although my algorithm for calculating this<br/>is very slow, I managed to go with 10 as the maximum complexity (meaning<br/>numerator times denominator is less than or equal to 2^10 = 1024) and<br/>calculate an s=1% curve with it. You can see it at<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/tenney1/t01_10.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/tenney1/t01_10.jpg</a>. There<br/>doesn&apos;t appear to be an overall slope, which is nice. I plotted the ratios<br/>of the local minima of this curve (except for the &quot;11/10&quot;) in<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/tenney1/tcmp1.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/tenney1/tcmp1.jpg</a>. Here you can<br/>see that for the simplest ratios, the relationship between Tenney complexity<br/>and harmonic entropy is amazingly linear. Then, as we hit the finite s and<br/>the insufficient maximum complexity of the input series, the pattern begins<br/>to break down.</p><p>So the naive guess is substantiated so far. A more convincing demonstration<br/>would use a higher maximum complexity, a smaller s value (say 0.6%) as well<br/>as an intermediate one, and an overall range much wider than one octave.<br/>Anyone care to tackle the calculations (they seem to be beyond my computer&apos;s<br/>resources for now . . .)?</p></div><h3>Paul H.

The &quot;Tenney series&quot; is the set of all<br/>ratios of two numbers (in lowest terms)<br/>where the product of the two numbers is<br/>less than some limit (I&apos;ve been using 10000<br/>here).

The reason for this is that a<br/>Farey series become less and less dense<br/>(density evaluated logarithmically, i.e., per<br/>octave or per semitone) as one moves to<br/>wider and wider intervals, while the &quot;Tenney<br/>series&quot; shows no such trend, at least over<br/>the first two octave.</p><p>Interestingly, the ratios that show local<br/>minima (and bumps that suggest local<br/>minima would &quot;grow&quot; with a slightly smaller<br/>s value) are neatly characterized by a<br/>Tenney limit (about 67 for s=1%, about 108 for<br/>s=0.6%) _regardless_ of whether a Farey or<br/>Tenney series is used to &quot;seed&quot; the<br/>calculation.

In concrete<br/>acoustical context, interval is defined as &quot;distance&quot; between two tones.<br/>Set of intervals can be defined more abstractly in relation with internal<br/>composition law and axioms applied. An interval is not fondamentally the<br/>sensible correlate of an acoustical parameter like pitch with frequency.<br/>It&apos;s not a &quot;sensible&quot; but an &quot;intelligible&quot;. Pitch (Hz) can&apos;t be a<br/>composable element in algebraic structure. With pitch, A+B or A*B have no<br/>sense, but interval composed with interval give a compound interval. A deep<br/>understanding of musical fonction of interval and macrotonal coherence<br/>require cutting with sound parametrization. Interval act as sign in musical<br/>communication and invariant properties have to be distinguished of<br/>sensative one to modelize communication.</p><p>Hoping it&apos;s now error free.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2000 3:12:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul E wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;You yourself observed that you like 4:5:6:7 but don&apos;t like<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4.
