I&apos;m very grateful for your passion combined<br/>with knowledge.  Interestingly, your &quot;golden ear&quot; may be reversed with<br/>mine when it comes to synthesized piano voices; there, I seem to be the<br/>one who is hard to satisfy.</p><p>[Joseph Pehrson:]<br/>&gt;It really sounds like just, only without all the &quot;weirdness&quot; of the<br/>&gt;changing...  Or maybe I&apos;m appreciating it more these days... although<br/>&gt;I really believe there is a substantial improvement in John&apos;s<br/>&gt;&quot;technique&quot;... (??).</p><p>I hope there is!  I think this is still a long way from the &quot;holy grail&quot;<br/>(whatever that might mean; let us say, my ears&apos; ultimate satisfaction),<br/>but I do find these latest tunings lovely!  O&apos;course, you have to<br/>imagine me listening to 7, &apos;cause that&apos;s where I spend 80% or more of<br/>my time...</p><p>[Margo Schulter:]<br/>&gt;Hello, there, John deLaubenfels and everyone.</p><p>Hello, Margo.  Thank you so much for your warm wishes!</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s very exciting to see such a promising technique developed in good<br/>&gt;part through this Tuning List,</p><p>Indeed this list is invaluable!</p><p>&gt;and also to see how critical response can become more and more<br/>&gt;favorable as a new technique matures.</p><p>I am at most a teenager at this point...</p><p>&gt;Just as in computer programming there are proverbially no nontrivial<br/>&gt;programs without bugs, so in music and tuning, trying any new method<br/>&gt;inevitably involves &quot;glitches,&quot; &quot;infelicities,&quot; and results which may<br/>&gt;not only illustrate the limitations of first attempts but point the<br/>&gt;way to next developments. The &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; saga so far may<br/>&gt;nicely illustrate these points.</p><p>True; it is still early days...</p><p>&gt;Although I don&apos;t have the technical means I suspect may be required to<br/>&gt;process your files, and also the music might be a bit &quot;modern&quot; for me<br/>&gt;to judge &lt;grin&gt;, I am getting a great vicarious thrill hearing the<br/>&gt;critical response of people like Paul Erlich. When he said that your<br/>&gt;setting sounded like it was played on a fixed-pitch instrument, that<br/>&gt;was _really_ exciting!</p><p>Kyool!   Are you sure you don&apos;t have the means?  My tunings require<br/>General MIDI (&quot;GM&quot;) capability, which almost any recent (5 years?)<br/>sound-card can be expected to support.  O&apos;course, you may not HAVE a<br/>sound card, I can&apos;t remember if you&apos;ve told the list...</p><p>&gt;As far as the question of a base tuning -- 12-tone equal temperament<br/>&gt;(12-tet), or 31-tet, or something else -- I would be much inclined to<br/>&gt;follow the approach you outlined in a recent post: see what tuning<br/>&gt;makes most musical sense for a given composition. This is also Mark<br/>&gt;Lindley&apos;s method for deciding whether an early 16th-century lute<br/>&gt;piece, for example, might be best in Pythagorean, meantone, or 12-tet,<br/>&gt;all possible tunings in that era before 12-tet was &quot;standardized&quot; for<br/>&gt;the instrument maybe around the 1540&apos;s.</p><p>ok...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m tempted to add that your arrangements might sound considerably<br/>&gt;_smoother_ than my idea of 16th-century 5-limit JI on a fixed keyboard<br/>&gt;-- or actually _two_ such keyboards -- using a 15-note tuning based on<br/>&gt;Zarlino&apos;s JI keyboard layout with G-D just on one keyboard and D-A on<br/>&gt;the other. (Zarlino uses split keys rather than two manuals, but the<br/>&gt;intervals should be the same.)</p><p>Smoother than you would prefer, you mean?</p><p>&gt;Anyway, for pieces where diesis distinctions (e.g. G#/Ab) seem a<br/>&gt;feature rather than a bug, I would agree that your proposal for 31-tet<br/>&gt;is a very nice choice: it&apos;s documented by Lemme Rossi in 1666, and is<br/>&gt;close enough to circulating meantone 31 (1/4-comma) to be just about<br/>&gt;equivalent for earlier Renaissance and Manneristic music also, if your<br/>&gt;experiments at some point run in that direction. The precise<br/>&gt;mathematical symmetry of 31-tet might make things a bit simpler, and<br/>&gt;if you follow the &quot;not-quite-precisely-just-consonances&quot; approach<br/>&gt;sometimes advocated here, the slight difference between a 31-tet major<br/>&gt;third and a pure 5:4 might also be at least as much a feature as a<br/>&gt;compromise.</p><p>Yes, I have a first draft of a mapper from a sequence to 31-tET, but<br/>it&apos;s got PROBLEMS: it&apos;s taking Mozart on a 50-fifths journey DOWN the<br/>circle of fifths (C-F-Bb...), which I know can&apos;t be right!  Got a few<br/>bugs to work out yet...</p><p>If anyone can actually hear the difference between a true 5:4 and a<br/>31-tET 5:4 (10 microtones), my hat is off to him/her.  We&apos;re talking a<br/>fraction of a cent here!  The minor third and, more importantly fifth,<br/>are more problematic, of course, but the use of the mapping isn&apos;t<br/>tied to that problem: I would use it to identify a distinction between<br/>notes, then let each &quot;note&quot; in the &gt;12 set find its own COFT position.</p><p>&gt;While I&apos;m hesitant to make any proposals which might maybe be detours<br/>&gt;on your &quot;road to Parnassus&quot; which you are negotiating very<br/>&gt;successfully as is, I wonder about the possibility for some 18th-19th<br/>&gt;century music of a base scale based on an unequal 12-tone (or larger,<br/>&gt;as Paul Erlich has mentioned in a different context) well-temperament,<br/>&gt;for example.</p><p>How&apos;s that different from COFT without additional adaptive tuning<br/>overtop?  I seem to be be misunderstanding.</p><p>&gt;The idea that occurred to me as that maybe vertical intervals in all<br/>&gt;transpositions could be equally consonant, but melodic steps or<br/>&gt;adjustments might somehow vary to give a certain kind of &quot;key color.&quot;<br/>&gt;Again, this raises the question of whether such variations (originally<br/>&gt;in vertical tension, also) are a positive feature of the music, at<br/>&gt;least for some composers, or for other composers or pieces more of a<br/>&gt;concession to the exigencies of fixed tuning.</p><p>Well, it can&apos;t be doubted that for some music the out-of-tuneness IS an<br/>integral part.  But my own feeling for the most part is that, for older<br/>music (before 1900, say), the problems of continuous adaptive JI cause<br/>plenty of compromise in the intervals.  And of course 5-limit tritones<br/>are wildly out of tune.</p><p>But again, I feel I&apos;m not really following your idea here.  Could you<br/>add more?</p><p>&gt;This last question can be a very elusive one: if Werckmeister or Bach<br/>&gt;could have somehow come up with a keyboard with pure fifths and thirds<br/>&gt;everywhere, would they have embraced it -- or have found it too<br/>&gt;&quot;bland&quot; compared to the variety of tension in a usual<br/>&gt;well-temperament?</p><p>An interesting question!  I can only speak for my own tastes.  Of course<br/>with my spring model, I &quot;never&quot; do achieve perfect JI.</p><p>&gt;Sometimes this question of intentions can be an elusive one. When I<br/>&gt;see a spelled-out diminished fourth in a vocal or keyboard composition<br/>&gt;of the 16th century (e.g. G#-C, usually between two upper parts), I<br/>&gt;tend to read it as a deliberate choice for something not too far from<br/>&gt;32:25 (~427 cents), or at any rate an interval in meantone or some<br/>&gt;vocal approximation of 5-limit JI quite different from a usual major<br/>&gt;third.</p><p>&gt;Thus I may not be especially pleased when I read a music history from<br/>&gt;40 years or so back taking a 16th-century composition with various<br/>&gt;neat diminished or augmented intervals of this kind and proposing that<br/>&gt;the notation should be interpreted by rewriting it as if this were<br/>&gt;12-tet, so that G#-C were just a &quot;fancy&quot; way of asking for Ab-C.</p><p>&gt;For the 18th century, however, and also for 16th-century lute music<br/>&gt;and at least some 17th-century keyboard music (Froberger, maybe some<br/>&gt;Frescobaldi), questions can get a lot more complicated. For the lute,<br/>&gt;by around 1545 or 1550, 12-tet seems standard, and we know from two<br/>&gt;theorists of very different bents, the radical Vincenzo Galilei and<br/>&gt;the conservative Artusi, that the equivalent of diminished fourths and<br/>&gt;sevenths on lute to regular major thirds and sixths was a feature<br/>&gt;noted and exploited by composers.</p><p>&gt;From a philosophical point of view, maybe I&apos;d prefer to speak not of<br/>&gt;&quot;pain&quot; but of &quot;stress&quot; in considering either vertical or melodic<br/>&gt;deviations from some ideal of interval size or scale symmetry, etc.</p><p>&gt;Thus while I might describe a tuning such as 1/4-comma meantone as not<br/>&gt;in any usual sense &quot;painful&quot; for Renaissance music, I would<br/>&gt;nevertheless recognize that the tempering of the fifths, for example,<br/>&gt;involves a degree of &quot;stress&quot; -- some stress possibly being a usual<br/>&gt;norm in music as in life.</p><p>That&apos;s the $64,000 question.  For me, music is a place where the<br/>greatest possible release from &quot;stress&quot; is paramount.  There, it is a<br/>joy for intervals (including 7:4) to be close to true in the midst of<br/>frenetic 19th century (etc.) music.  But I would not discount the<br/>opposite experience, especially given how different our ears are (I use<br/>the word &quot;ears&quot;, of course, to refer to the ear/brain combination, and,<br/>as for the brain, its subdivisions are endless...).</p><p>&gt;We have evidence that in the 16th century this stress was generally<br/>&gt;taken for granted, but also that some attempts to remove it by the use<br/>&gt;of classic or adaptive JI keyboards (e.g. Zarlino&apos;s classic 5-limit<br/>&gt;scheme and Vicentino&apos;s 38-note adaptive scheme) were regarded as<br/>&gt;striking enough in effect to merit some technical complications, even<br/>&gt;if mainly on an experimental basis.</p><p>Yes... my own perspective is that the question of historical<br/>faithfulness is very interesting but secondary to the question of what<br/>draws one forward, whatever its mix of its roots.  Well, I guess we all<br/>feel that way, and the two don&apos;t HAVE to be in conflict, of course!</p><p>&gt;However, these historical musings quite aside, &quot;nothing succeeds like<br/>&gt;success.&quot; Maybe what you&apos;ve done is something like my approach of<br/>&gt;realizing early music on synthesizer -- but in some ways more<br/>&gt;challenging, because you are devising new aesthetic algorithms, as it<br/>&gt;were, and dealing with very delicate parameters of melody and<br/>&gt;verticality.</p><p>Well, I won&apos;t pretend I haven&apos;t been challenged, but I do also believe<br/>that this whole door is wiiiide open, and I don&apos;t want to puff up my<br/>work into more than it is (I wouldn&apos;t mind this type of tuning<br/>catching on in a big way, however; I think it&apos;s lovely!).</p><p>&gt;Having added these odd remarks, I want again to congratulate you on<br/>&gt;the latest results, and also for your patience as well as creativity<br/>&gt;in reaching them.</p><p>Many thanks, Margo!
