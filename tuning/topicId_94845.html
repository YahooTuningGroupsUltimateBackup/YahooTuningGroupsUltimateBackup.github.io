I will say<br/>that from a strictly business standpoint, a friend of mine sent him a<br/>guitar to get refretted a few months ago. After I got into a fight<br/>with Ron and this friend ended up unfortunately getting dragged into<br/>it, Ron has I guess decided to hold his guitar in limbo, and as far as<br/>we know still has his guitar. This was in like July/August and now<br/>it&apos;s November.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2010 8:57:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve purchased several guitars from Ron, it always takes him longer than he says it will and I think in your case he had a seminar or something in CA that he drove out for, so he was gone for like two weeks.  My impression of the dude is that he is busy as hell, and maybe a bit of a spaz, and it&apos;s occasionally hard to get ahold of him or get a straight answer.  Even when buying something from him that he&apos;s already got made, it usually takes a few weeks.  Also, he did promise me a scale book for 20-EDO when I ordered my first guitar from him, but that has yet to materialize.

That neck took something on the order of 6 months, and it was all done by machine.  Granted, it was an amazing neck when it was finished, but let me tell you--getting a hold of them and getting a straight answer or a definite time estimate was IMPOSSIBLE.  They would give me a date, then the date would come and no guitar would arrive and I&apos;d call them and they&apos;d say &quot;another two weeks&quot; and then another two weeks would elapse and still no guitar and they&apos;d tell me the same thing.  This happened for several months.</p><p>Point being, in the luthier world, I&apos;ve met only one who meets his first estimate, but he doesn&apos;t do microtonal conversions (or if he did, they would be vastly more expensive).  Most luthiers are not dependable as far as time-estimates goes; if they say &quot;two weeks&quot;, it means two months.  Ron will get you your guitar, eventually, and it will be worth the wait.  You just have to be patient.  My guess--you&apos;ll get it around the winter solstice.  If he hasn&apos;t gotten it to you by then, I will be very disappointed in him.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;christopherv&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I really have no other place to post this since I wish to know of people&apos;s experience with purchasing guitars from Ron Sword.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I commissioned a 22 edo guitar on September 20th from Ron.
