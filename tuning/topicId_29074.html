The 12-note scale is<br/>usually thought of as 1/3-comma meantone temperament, but 12 meantone<br/>fifths are a small enough number that it can be treated as a scale of<br/>pattern 121212212122, with modulation and all the rest of it.

As an alternative to diatonic, there is therefore the<br/>7-note scale with pattern 1414144 in the 19-et. Also, 11-note scales<br/>have been discussed a little of late on the math list, and we have a<br/>fine one here: 11311311313; containing both of these is the<br/>15-note scale 111211121112112.</p><p>The generator 2/19, with a 7-limit complexity of  7 and a 9 and<br/>11-limit complexity of 11 gives nice 9 and 10 note scales, with<br/>pattern 222222223 and 2222222221.</p><p>We also do well with 4/19, with a 9-limit complexity of 8, and a<br/>different 9-note scale, with pattern 131313133, as well as a nice<br/>14-note scale with pattern 11211211211212.</p></div><h3><a id=29089 href="#29089">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2001 2:06:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; Joseph has remarked that the 19-et seems weird to him.
