I&apos;ve<br/>   always fixed it by lowering the pickups, as it<br/>   seemed to be caused by the magnets &apos;tugging&apos;<br/>   some sick anti-node out of the string. I don&apos;t<br/>   know if this was the particular effect you<br/>   were referring to.</p><p>2) To work microtonally some, all or none of the<br/>   time is a difficult question. It was good to<br/>   hear Neil chime in on good music in 12tet.</p><p>   My musical activities fight for time with my<br/>   day job and my family. Daily, I practice guitar<br/>   and do some amount of &apos;deep listenning&apos;.<br/>   Occasionally, I<br/>      rehearse/jam/perform jazz<br/>      compose jazz compositions<br/>      play other instruments (drums and keyboards)<br/>      do non-musical art (painting and sculpture)<br/>      etc...</p><p>   I WAS going to buy a 31-tet guitar since it<br/>   would seem that my existing repetoire would be<br/>   realizeable after some practice (at least with<br/>   flexible instruments) and it would discretize<br/>   some of extensions to 5-limit that I already am<br/>   comfortable with (septimal sevenths and thirds,<br/>   neutral intervals, a decent 11/8...)</p><p>   However, there is a commitment here that is<br/>   VERY difficult to make. It costs a lot, has a<br/>   learning curve (I&apos;ve been playing 7-string for<br/>   about six months now and am still playing all<br/>   kinds of new and unexpected mistakes), and I<br/>   don&apos;t know if thats the &apos;right&apos; tuning to<br/>   make the next &apos;step&apos; in my music (or even if<br/>   tuning investigations are going to be as<br/>   beneficial a direction to pursue as, for<br/>   instance, grokking more rhythm through my<br/>   hand-drumming).</p><p>As far as how this all relates to my enjoyment of<br/>the list</p><p>   a) I like the math, when I understand it<br/>   b) I like seeing other peoples mechanisms for<br/>      getting a musical process going, whether<br/>      that is a list of just ratios, a lattice<br/>      showing the capabilitys of a certain EDO,<br/>      etc... It all seems to me to be a way of<br/>      looking over your materials and getting a<br/>      handle on where the tension and resolution<br/>      will naturally be found. On this list,<br/>      the concentration is on which<br/>      intervals are more or less concordant and<br/>      will therefor fit into a musical spectrum<br/>      of consonance and dissonance. You can<br/>      also just jam on the pitch set and discover<br/>      what you like. Theres no reason not to<br/>      do both.<br/>   c) I believe that there ARE fundamental<br/>      aspects to harmonic music which<br/>      investigations such as the H.E. graphs<br/>      bring to light. How much they may influence<br/>      my future music, I don&apos;t know, nor do I<br/>      know how they fit in with musics which<br/>      are clearly NOT close approximations to<br/>      small fractions.<br/>   d) I enjoy exposure to historical and/or<br/>      cultural movements (and their musics) which<br/>      I wouldn&apos;t otherwise get exposed to. Finding<br/>      a new music to listen to is one of the<br/>      best things that happens.</p><p>enough for now,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
