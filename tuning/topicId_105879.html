A few things happened since, and there are even more exciting news since the last conversation on this topic.</p><p>We have 2 more persons interested in buying the keyboard.</p><p>I became friends with a young software company that develops a synth just as fresh as the Terpstra: very simple, user-friendly and intuitive, yet powerful and acoustically rich, with an incredible twist in sound computing. They made me a good offer to bundle the synth with the keyboard.</p><p>This means that in the Kickstarter campaign there will be one extra slot for the keyboard+synth bundle. In the future, it will be possible to support the Terpstra directly in the synth. This means that the synth would recognize the attached Terpstra and offer a special pull-down menu for different tunings etc. The best part is that I managed to get free updates for all buyers from this first 20 batch. Put simply, buy the synth now at a low price and get the &quot;Terpstra Update&quot; for free when it will be available.</p><p>There is one more thing - and this would turn our keyboard into the best controller ever built - but I can&apos;t spit it out until I have cleared things with Dylan. It&apos;s about adding a cool extra feature but please let&apos;s not turn this into a topic.</p><p>As for our list, the number could go up to 15 if I make a personal investment and buy 3 more keyboards for myself.</p><p>01.

Bogdan&Acirc;&acute;s investment #3</p><p>This sounds great, but we&apos;re still short of 5 people.</p><p>I&apos;m in the process of signing some papers with Dylan and that will make me authorized dealer of his product. This means that I will be able to start the Kickstarter campaign, and I can&apos;t imagine this campaign being otherwise than successful.</p><p>In the mean time I&apos;m continuing the search for investment: fundings, grants, private or anything that would allow us to get to 20.</p><p>We&apos;re all looking forward to this.</p><p>Thank you for being a part of this project.</p><p>Bogdan</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bogdan&quot;  wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- This is a double post from<br/>&gt; &gt; --- &quot;The Xenharmonic Alliance&quot; Facebook Group.<br/>&gt; &gt; --- To see the pictures, follow the link:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.10150998052409482">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.10150998052409482</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Would you be interested in a limited-edition, not-in-production<br/>&gt; generalised keyboard?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Layout: matrix, 2D hexagonal, completely generalised. The geometry of<br/>&gt; the Terpstra keyboard layout is characterized by a vertical shift in<br/>&gt; position between the top surface of a key and the six keys adjacent to<br/>&gt; it. This results in an intuitive feel for changes in pitch as your<br/>&gt; fingers move across the keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Each key has a removable magnetic key cap, so different colored or<br/>&gt; labeled key caps can be easily swapped around when you re-map the keys<br/>&gt; to a different scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;The main difference with our keyboard is the expressivity allowed by<br/>&gt; the mechanical action of the keys, which is completely different from<br/>&gt; other similar keyboards that had been produced in the past.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The key sensing for the Terpstra is one of a kind because the<br/>&gt; electronics constantly monitor the position of every key by magnetically<br/>&gt; sensing for the whole key throw (not by triggering switches at the<br/>&gt; bottom of the key press and measuring the time differential). When a key<br/>&gt; is depressed, the entire change in position is monitored and translated<br/>&gt; to a very accurate and nuanced velocity by the time the key hits the<br/>&gt; bottom.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;I am a keyboard player and the feel of the Terpstra was really<br/>&gt; exceptional and had very expressive touch that was lighter but much like<br/>&gt; a real piano, only faster.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Every key is easily re-mappable and if mapped to a continuous<br/>&gt; controller, then slowly depressing any re-mapped key sends out<br/>&gt; continuous data like a fader in real time. It does all of this with no<br/>&gt; latency.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Upon seeing it, I could immediately appreciate the manufacturing<br/>&gt; quality of this prototype &iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot; well made thick aluminum case with a<br/>&gt; look and solidity that is reminiscent of Apple G5 and 8-core towers.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Keyboards take a huge amount of abuse during live performance. This<br/>&gt; one is a precision machine built like a tank; it can withstand the<br/>&gt; constant pounding of an energetic concert performance.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This innovative and quality controller has a key layout that, unlike<br/>&gt; the Bosanquet, Jank&Atilde;&sup3; and other generalized/isomorphic keyboards,<br/>&gt; puts each key at a slightly different height &iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot; which when combined<br/>&gt; with the irregular shape of the front row of keys, allows you to feel<br/>&gt; where your hands are on the keys without looking. This means that for<br/>&gt; the first time you can play a matrix keyboard without having to<br/>&gt; constantly look at it to know where you are.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;I would LOVE to map some keys to sweep filters, and leave other keys<br/>&gt; as notes to trigger the sounds feeding through the filter. This WOULD be<br/>&gt; the funkiest microtonal thing ever!&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The product designers who built the only 2 working prototypes are<br/>&gt; ready to take a 20-pieces order. The first one is mine, so there are 19<br/>&gt; &quot;available&quot;. The culprit is, it cannot go into production unless there<br/>&gt; are at least 20 buyers.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Price: 2189 USD / 1789 EUR<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Alternatives:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-Thru Music Axis 64 - 2312 USD / 1887 EUR<br/>&gt; &gt; Opal Gecko - 3749 USD / 3060 EUR<br/>&gt; &gt; StarrLabs MicroZone U-648 - 8995 USD / 7365 EUR<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=105880 href="#105880">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2013 1:39:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bogdan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>&gt; It&apos;s been a painful long time since this endeavour was started.<br/>&gt; A few things happened since, and there are even more exciting news<br/>&gt; since the last conversation on this topic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have 2 more persons interested in buying the keyboard.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; I&apos;m in the process of signing some papers with Dylan and that<br/>&gt; will make me authorized dealer of his product.

We have decided to upgrade and expand the capabilities of the controller by adding a few features:</p><p>- Upgrade connectivity to USB and wireless OSC (Open Sound Control - <a href="http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc">http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc</a>) in addition to standard MIDI. This would allow a handheld device like a smartphone or tablet to control the settings on the keyboard by changing tunings &amp; creating presets. If a software synthesizer is used, the Terpstra could exchange any information we might think of with it.<br/>- Add RGB LED keycaps that would instantly change color according to layout changes (sold separately).<br/>- To make these possible, a mini computer will be installed onboard. So far the best choice seems to be Raspberry Pi - <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs</a> - which will further expand connectivity to HDMI, LAN, AUDIO OUT and extra USB.<br/>- Depending on Raspberry Pi&apos;s DSP capabilities, the Terpstra Keyboard could generate and send visuals through HDMI output, by creating patterns based on the harmonic relationships between the notes played; it could act like a hardware Synthesia Game when used with the RGB LED color changing keycaps and could also host a real-time synthesizer, generating tones and thus transforming the controller into a musical instrument - though I&apos;m not sure if the hardware could handle that.</p><p>The campaign will use the funding platform Indiegogo - <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">http://www.indiegogo.com/</a> with some of the lower perks filled with bounties for Siemen Terpstra, who made available for this project two of his papers: &quot;The Terpstra Keyboard Design Specifications&quot; (3 pages text, 2 diagrams and 4 color pictures with the cardboard scale models he built) and &quot;Irregular Temperaments and the Division of the Ditonic Comma&quot; (60 pages text, 109 pages with hand drawn diagrams and tables) - a study of 80 historic keyboard tunings, characterized by Johnny Reinhard as the best paper ever written on temperaments. The color pictures could be also used as thank-you greeting cards.</p><p>Because we are still not 20 - the minimum number needed for this batch to be produced, I will buy 6 keyboards and make this happen. The price remains the same: 2189 USD. The only thing that keeps me from starting the campaign right now are the added shipping fees, customs (import) and VAT taxes.</p><p>The main issue is organizing a campaign with fixed perk price and, as Dylan suggests, shipping not included. This would mean that after contributing to funding, each person will have to pay again for shipping. But the most annoying are the import fees. Dylan points out that there would be 5.4% duty importing into the USA for example, though no one knows for sure. In Denmark, the sum would be around 600-700 extra USD for every kebyoard, not taking shipping into consideration!</p><p>I intially calculated the price in Euros having these expenses in mind, but I never imagined it could go so high.

The 20 prototypes will be built fully functional from the hardware standpoint, and will be able to operate out-of-the-box. The features that require programming, like OSC, continuous controller keys, color changing keys or whatever new idea we might come up with (provided the hardware can handle it), will be available only after building the keyboards and programming them.</p><p>By funding this campaign, you will get one of the 20 fully capable prototypes with regular colored plastic key-caps, which will be able to send MIDI data right from the start. This means that any of them can be used just like any other controller, and with the help of third party (free) software it will play, on whatever layout, in whatever tonality you wish. As development continues, you will receive free updates that will activate missing and extra functions. You could of course program it based on your specific needs, or join the other campaign supporters to create an open-source software community around this concept.</p><p>Does anyone know how can a protoype be declared at customs, so as to avoid extra fees?</p><p>Would you agree with making a separate payment for shipping?</p><p>[this message has also been posted in The Xenharmonic Alliance II Group on Facebook - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/</a>]</p></div><h3><a id=106249 href="#106249">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2013 3:15:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hooray!!</p><p>-Carl</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bogdan&quot; &lt;baros_ilogic@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The long awaited Terpstra Keyboard is very close to getting into a 20-unit production run.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although it&apos;s been a year since I first started this list, there have been ongoing discussions between me, Dylan Horvath - keyboard&apos;s designer and manufacturer, and Siemen Terpstra - keyboard&apos;s layout designer, including Johnny Reinhard from the AFFM who originally hired Dylan to make a prototype.
