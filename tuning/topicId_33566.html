I made the<br/>assumption that, inasmuch as the violet end of the spectrum appears<br/>to be headed toward something looking like red, light 2:1&apos;s<br/>(or &quot;octaves&quot;), like those of sound, if we could see them, would<br/>probably be perceived as having the same &quot;chroma,&quot; if I may use that<br/>word.</p><p>The speed of light enters into the calculation to convert frequency<br/>of light to wavelength, from which we determine color.  The speed of<br/>light in air is very close to that in a vacuum, so the difference<br/>between the two doesn&apos;t affect the calculation significantly.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other values could be used e.g. speed of sound in appropriate media<br/>etc.</p><p>This is totally irrelevant, inasmuch as the speed of sound doesn&apos;t<br/>enter into the calculation.</p><p>As for the other individual I had in mind who came up with &quot;green&quot;<br/>for C by an entirely different method, I don&apos;t remember his name.  I<br/>received a brochure from him in a mailing in the mid-1970&apos;s<br/>advertising &quot;perfect pitch seminars&quot; that he was conducting, in which<br/>he claimed to be able to teach this ability.  (Inasmuch as I already<br/>have absolute pitch or tonal memory, as some prefer to call it, I had<br/>no interest in it and eventually discarded the brochure.)</p><p>He compared the perception of pitch in persons having this ability as<br/>analogous to our recognition of visual color (with which I can agree<br/>in a very general sense), and he went so far as to relate specific<br/>pitches to specific colors: in particular, he thought that F-sharp<br/>had a &quot;twanginess&quot; that suggested red, and his diagram associated all<br/>of the C&apos;s with green.  I suspected that any twang that he associated<br/>with F-sharp was due more to the quality of the tritone (either<br/>melodically or harmonically) it makes with C (assuming that he was<br/>probably C-centric), although I couldn&apos;t disagree with his<br/>observation based on my own subjectivity, being rather C-centric<br/>myself.  I never thought that there was much of a perceivable<br/>relationship between pitch and color, and the closest I ever came to<br/>that was perhaps thinking that B-flat might suggest a golden yellow<br/>(or shades of brown in the lower octaves).</p><p>It immediately occurred to me to try calculating a frequency<br/>conversion between sound and light, and I found that transposing<br/>middle C up 43 octaves did indeed give green.  However, F-sharp did<br/>not come out red, but in the near infrared (or ultraviolet, depending<br/>on the octave), and I thought that, if we could see it, would<br/>probably appear to be magenta, which color I would describe as<br/>even &quot;twangier&quot; than red (which ends up closer to A-flat).  Also, B-<br/>flat does come close to golden yellow.</p><p>So go figure!  Is this a coincidence or not?</p><p>--George</p></div>
