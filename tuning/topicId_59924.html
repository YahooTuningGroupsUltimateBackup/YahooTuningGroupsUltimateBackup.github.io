In just a few minutes with only a few minor adjustments I was able to make this recording from my retuned MIDI file.</p><p>It&apos;s supposed to be in 17-ET, but it sounds so good this way, I can live with a few little intonation problems. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s up with that horn part near the end (around 1:32); probably trying to simulate the effect of sticking a hand into the bell of the horn or something.

He loaded the<br/>Synful collection, not as a stand-alone application, but as a DirectX<br/>Instrument (DXi) right inside of the sequencer, and assigned<br/>individual midi tracks to instruments, such as violin, flute, etc.</p><p>Within that working paradigm, you would then load sfz as an instrument<br/>(in this case, in the format of a VST instrument), load your<br/>particular soundfont that corresponds to GM soundsets, and then assign<br/>the relevant tracks (lets think of the timpani track, for this<br/>example) not to the GM wavetable synth of the soundcard, but to the<br/>sfz soundset.</p><p>After this is done (I&apos;m guessing, but assuming his Cakewalk product<br/>works like most others), you then select all tracks and then export to<br/>audio (which is like having Timidity render the file).</p><p>What is different? Well, for one thing, you can work on your<br/>arrangement in realtime. Most people like to hear their music as they<br/>are developing the composition/arrangement, and this means you have a<br/>completely informative feedback loop. Don&apos;t like that bleeding oboe?<br/>Change the instrument and listen to the results _right_then_.</p><p>It&apos;s all about how you choose to work on music creation. I repeat that<br/>it isn&apos;t for everyone, and it still has a learning curve. But it works<br/>for me, and I&apos;m encouraged to see Herman step away from the default<br/>soundcard GM instruments.</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=59933 href="#59933">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2005 10:17:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; I hope you don&apos;t mind a few comments, as I&apos;m interested to see what<br/>&gt; Synful can do as well.
