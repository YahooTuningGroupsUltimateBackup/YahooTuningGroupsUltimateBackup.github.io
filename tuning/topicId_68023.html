You know, I wish I had more time in life to study everything I want...the whole area of early European music is fascinating, and very vast. But, I&apos;ll keep plugging away; and hanging out on the tuning forums is a good way to pick up info. If you can recommend any good books on this subject, not just related to Bach but the whole era and what was happening, I&apos;d love to check them out.</p><p>JR:  You know, read anything by Buelow, now retired from Indiana University.  He [Buelow] got it.  Also, check out books by Christoph Wolff (Harvard) which are easier to find (Barnes and Noble).</p><p>NH:  But you know, in digest 4198 you mentioned my &quot;it could be anything&quot; attitude in regards to how Bach tuned; actually, for me, I haven&apos;t yet come to any definitive conclusions about this subject...that&apos;s why I&apos;m asking all these questions, trying to get more info on the tuning practices of that era. It seems that there&apos;s a lot of folks with conflicting ideas, and I&apos;m trying to sort it all out...if that&apos;s ever possible, since we weren&apos;t there, and we&apos;re all trying to come to intelligent conclusions from what we have studied about that era.</p><p>JR:  True that.  If I misunderstood, I withdraw the affirmation of that mention.</p><p>N.H.:  And, I just saw Brad Lehman&apos;s article on how he interpreted the design on the cover of Bach&apos;s Well Tempered Clavier; very interesting stuff, for sure. And, I have the Goldberg Variations CD by Richard Egarr, where he uses that temperament...it is beautifully played, and sounds great to boot. Egarr says, in the liner notes, in regards to the tuning: &quot;Bradley Lehman seems to have discovered &apos;the truth,&apos; or at least A truth.&quot; Well, that seems like a good attitude to take regarding all of this; maybe Bach, and others of his day, tried a number of different tunings...why not?</p><p>JR:  Speculate away.  Only&mldr;I went to find out.  Noodled ornaments an upside down code for a tuning called &ldquo;well-temperament,&rdquo; they very same name invented by Andreas Werckmeister when Bach was a whelp&mldr;.Where do you see the connection break down?  Werckmeister remained in Bach&rsquo;s book shelves his whole life.  In terms of publications there was only Werckmeister, and Bach&rsquo;s relatives.  The Bachs and Werckmeisters were neighbors even in the physical sense; both would lose them in Muhlhausen, sort of an independent city-state, for some anonymity.  Except it is the home of the Ahles, a familty of admittedly pro-Werckmeister composers, and the organ builder and Werckmeister tuner Wender.</p><p>J.R.:  Guess, if the story was better told by musicologists, you and others might know something of this.  But there is more invested in having Bach out of reach (and in ET) rather than something knowable as culturally consistent history.  (Yes, Gene, you are correct.)</p><p>N.H.:  I mean, these were some of the greatest musical minds in history; why WOULDN&apos;T they have experimented with different different systems? If a guy like me enjoys playing in numerous systems, it certainly wouldn&apos;t be a giant surprise to find that a titan like Bach tried out various ways of tuning.</p><p>JR:  Werckmeister III is different systems.  Each key is intervallically different from another.  F major is practically just intonation.   I told you that C minor has and equal tempered major third.  Well, D minor has a large, almost just minor third.  Some keys embody Pythorean tuning.  And all this described for the first time in Western history in the young Bach&rsquo;s virtual backyard, in north eastern Thuringia.</p><p>JR: And, perhaps he was inspired by tuning theorists like Werckmeister, and came up with his own take on temperament...again, why not? I&apos;m sure, as I learn more about this era, I&apos;ll get more insights into what could have been happening then. But, we do know that there were many different ideas in the air about how to tune, and 12 eq had not yet come to dominate the scene.</p><p>JR:  Not likely, I&rsquo;m afraid.  Tom Dent can&rsquo;t see any reason to believe sixth comma meantone extended at all, while Joe Monzo sees much of it.  (Tom, please check past postings on this.)  I see it continuing into the 20th century.  I know because as a bassoonist, I have played it in orchestras throughout my life.  Neil, are you confusing the lots of ideas of tuning of today with the baroque days?  You have to start pre-baroque to do that.</p><p>To me Bradley&rsquo;s tuning is like Werckmeister VI, a basically near ET tuning found with measurements like one/seventh of a Pythagorean comma.  Radical methods providing similarities to other tunings.  Like Harrison&rsquo;s Pi connection to quarter-comma meantone.  Or the C minor triad of Werckmeister III with the C minor of Equal Temperament uni-key&mldr;  It&rsquo;s all fun.</p><p>All best, Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

(Tom, please check<br/>&gt; past postings on this.)</p><p>I have, it all boils down to a few historical sources, and almost all<br/>of them have nothing to do with tempered systems of fixed pitches. Not<br/>that I am saying extended 6th-comma necessarily sounds bad, or was<br/>necessarily a bad approximation to what some people might have played,<br/>just that I don&apos;t see any evidence that people actually *thought* in<br/>terms of 1/6 comma being nearly as strong as it has been promoted<br/>(ever since Barbour).</p><p>&gt; as a bassoonist, I have played it in orchestras throughout my life.</p><p>I&apos;m sceptical about the degree of accuracy and inflexibility this<br/>would require if taken literally.

Werckmeister VI is based on (complicated) j u s t<br/>intervals, it is nothing to do with divisions of a comma, the text of<br/>Musicalische Temperatur explicitly says as much. Unfortunately many<br/>20th century &apos;historians&apos; starting with Dupont &amp; Barbour have utterly<br/>misread the text and imagine (simply because of the number 7 popping<br/>up) that it has something to do with 1/7 comma.

I believe it was Neil Haverstick<br/>TD:  If &apos;the truth&apos; is (as Brad argued in Early Music) that Bach used only<br/>one type of keyboard tuning in his mature musical life, that pretty<br/>much excludes any other &apos;truths&apos;. Egarr is trying to have his cake &amp;<br/>eat it.</p><p>JR:  And a &ldquo;single keyboard tuning in his mature life&rdquo; makes meaningless Brad Lehman&rsquo;s constant &ldquo;clarity&rdquo; that there were organ-only tunings.  There were keyboard tunings plain and simple.  The organ tuning has to have more professional expertise because of the time and expense involved.  But every piece had a keyboard of discrete pitches, and every other musician playing had to follow it, the continuo.</p><p>JR: &gt; Werckmeister remained in Bach&acirc;&euro;&trade;s book shelves his whole life. (...)</p><p>TD: Fine - but he said many different, and even contradictory, things<br/>about tuning! First (1681) &apos;III and &apos;IV&apos;; then (1691) &apos;III&apos; and &apos;IV&apos;<br/>and &apos;V&apos; and &apos;VI&apos;; then (later 1690s) equal temperament, or some kind<br/>of ordinaire or &apos;well-temperament&apos; based on diluted meantone; then (at<br/>the end of his life) ET, or something near it that favoured the<br/>most-used keys.<br/>JR:  Fine &ndash; but you are infinitely more contradictory.  Actually, I don&rsquo;t seem him contradictory so much as confusing to moderns.  For example, you wrote &ldquo;ET, or somethingnear it that favoured the most-used keys.&rdquo;  Hmn&mldr; that&rsquo;s exactly what Werckmeister III is, equally-playable keys that favor the most-used keys.  And that was what he wrote about in 1691 for chromatic composers (of which he, himself, was declared not), but ideal for J.S. Bach, a chromatic composer.  And Werckmeister always referred back to this tuning his entire life.<br/>TD:  Bach would have had a lot to think about &amp; choose from<br/>- but arguably arising from the same overall principle.<br/>JR:  Disagree.  Bach would have learned directly from his uncle Johann Christoph Bach, the composer/keyboard virtuoso in the family.  JCB and A. Werckmeister were surely acquainted, but history disguises any encounter.  It might be that JCB was using Werckmeister III tuning &ndash; as a appropriate chromatic composer &ndash;  and Werckmeister, actually quite a modest fellow, listed it first after extended quarter-comma meantone (the incorrect tuning) of Praetorious.<br/>TD:  And arguably Neidhardt took up theoretically from exactly where W. had left off.<br/>JR:  Yes, you are arguing.  Neidhardt had non influence on JS Bach.  His Uncle JCB&rsquo;s oldest son was the winner of the contest with Neidhardt for the most &ldquo;musical&rdquo; tuning.  Poor Mr. Neidhardt lost with his monochord driven ET, later demoted two degrees to Neidhardt III.</p><p>&gt; more invested in having Bach out of reach (and in ET) rather than<br/>something knowable as culturally consistent history.</p><p>TD:  I&apos;m not sure this is true.

Whereas ET is<br/>common as mud &amp; not profitable for anyone, except piano tuners. Rasch<br/>himself is, as you should know, very interested in microtonality.</p><p>JR: Coincidentally, Prof. Rasch is an old friend of mine, and we have stayed with each other on various occasions.  However, we disagree on Werckmeister.  I do not believe he changed his views at the end of his life.  He was always selling 1691 Musicalische Tempeatur with its W. III.  Rasch doesn&rsquo;t accept that all keys are even playable in W.III.  I have found no such problem with W. III.<br/>TD:  As for &apos;knowable&apos; - hmmm, how knowable can he be, he must have met<br/>hundreds of organists and organbuilders, not to mention<br/>harpsichordists - of which we now know only a scant dozen. Say,<br/>Bendeler, down the road from Werckmeister, who made up a few of his<br/>own perfectly decent circulating tunings just a few years later - now<br/>how many more Bendelers were there who didn&apos;t bother to write it down?</p><p>JR:  Tom, I&rsquo;m not sure what your experience is, and I&rsquo;m sure you have little idea of what my involvement involves.  However, Werckmeister was a superstar in comparison to the small handful of independent tuning scholars in Thuringia.  As an organ expert, Werckmeister was unlikely to have a peer in Thuringia.<br/>Somehow I suspect that if Wercmeister was more of an asshole, if we had a painting with his face, with some example of his good lucks, then he would be better treated.  Really, it&rsquo;s rather deplorable.</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister III is different systems. Each key is intervallically<br/>different from another. (...) Some keys embody Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>TD:  Hum, I don&apos;t hear F# major and C# major having much intervallic<br/>difference myself. Rather too much Pythagoras.</p><p>JR:  And totally meaningless as to whether Bach used it or not.<br/>TD:  Still, in practice it&apos;s almost impossible to come up with a scheme<br/>which makes absolutely every key both reasonably pleasant *and*<br/>identifiably different.<br/>JR:  And that is exactly what Werckmeister accomplished.  Even if it was used by someone else (like a Bach) it was the first presentation of what can be accomplished exactly as you said.<br/>TD:  W&apos;s later turn towards ET and/or diluted meantones may have acknowledged this.</p><p>JR:  This is false.  I have covered this in the past with others before.  Just using the word &ldquo;meantone&rdquo; for Werckmeister is wrong-headed, IMHO.</p><p>&gt; Tom Dent can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see any reason to believe sixth comma meantone<br/>extended at all, while Joe Monzo sees much of it. (Tom, please check<br/>&gt; past postings on this.)</p><p>I have, it all boils down to a few historical sources, and almost all<br/>of them have nothing to do with tempered systems of fixed pitches.

But half-way between just and Pyth is some kind of sixth comma meantone.  But check out Telemann explaining chromatic extended sixth comma meantone.  And Silbermann&rsquo;s insistence on tuning sixth-comma meantone in Dresden and throughout Thuringia and Saxon-Anhalt.</p><p>&gt; as a bassoonist, I have played it in orchestras throughout my life.</p><p>TD:  I&apos;m sceptical about the degree of accuracy and inflexibility this<br/>would require if taken literally.

My preferred method is to work by individual cents.  Now, if you want to howl about this, joint the club.  But you owe it to the truth to listen to some of the many recordings made on the PITCH label that represent some of the best results.</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister VI, a basically near ET tuning found with measurements<br/>like one/seventh of a Pythagorean comma.</p><p>TD:  Oh, please!

Seems no one in history, except maybe you?  BTW, I have all the Werckmeister texts.  Mark Lindley gave me my first translation of Musical Temperament (Elizabeth Hehr).  If you are into character assassination, either dead or living victims, please let us just wrap up instead.</p><p>TD:  Actually the &apos;septenarius&apos; is better approximated by fifth-comma steps<br/>(apart from the bizarrely low pitch of D). But it&apos;s not clear if this<br/>was intentional.</p><p>JR:  No, it&rsquo;s all unclear.  I see now I must have been wasting my time recording Brandenburg Concerti in Werckmeister III&mldr;.If only I could see through all the intentional unintentionals to be able to intentionalize myself, not.  (sorry, you bring out the sarcasm in me.)<br/>TD:  Oh well.

Apparently at this point<br/>he didn&apos;t think Three worth remembering.</p><p>If you disagree with this, please say why, and how you get it from the<br/>text.</p><p>JR:  I disagree.  Firstly, I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;diluted meantone&rdquo; constitutes a tuning.  Meantone is identical key to key, but well-temperament is not.  Using phrases like &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; sharp certainly does not mean &ldquo;equally&rdquo; sharp.  To respect Werckmeister as an intellectual is to see his consistency, not to undercut him at every instance, possibly as a result of following others who do likewise.  I know it shakes up the world that you &ldquo;think&rdquo; you know.  But is it the only way to get at the truth.  And yes, there is truth to be gained.  If you think this otherwise then we are finished in discussion, which would be sad.<br/>Even the posthumously published work (1707) referred back to the 1691 publication for the real nitty-gritty of tuning.  For detail, please read these excerpts from my unpublished writings:<br/>            Another Werckmeister publication that contained important tuning information came as a 1698 amendment to his Die nothwendigsten Ammerckungen und Regeln, wie der Bassus continuus oder General-Bass wohl k&ouml;nne tractiret werden (Essential annotations and rules concerning the proper realization of the basso continuo or thorough-bass), Werckmeister published &ldquo;Short Lesson and Addition, how one can tune and temper well a clavier.&rdquo;  Directed towards beginners in tacet recognition that organs will always need to be tuned by trained professionals, Werckmeister attempts to aid the more na&iuml;ve reader in tuning the harpsichord, and eventually, the clavichord.  These individuals were unlikely to consult the monochord instructions in his work for professionals.</p><p>Moreover, there is quite a difference between tuning strings and pipes.  If, therefore, an organist is ignorant of pipe tuning or, as the case may be, of adjusting the voicing, he ought not, under any circumstance, to remove a single pipe; for when a pipe is removed, it can very easily be put back differently and out of tune (Krapf, p. 62).</p><p>For the professional tuner, it is imperative to consult Musicalische Temperatur,</p><p>or the clear and authentic mathematical instruction of how, through the analysis of the monochord, one can tune a keyboard instrument (especially organs, positives, regals, spinets, and such) in a well-tempered manner, in order that according to the practice of today, all modi ficti can be accepted in a pleasing and tolerable harmony; with a preliminary perfection and lesser perfection of the musical numbers, proportions, and consonants which in the process of setting up the temperament, are to be seriously considered.  In addition, a monochord is depicted distinctly and completely in a copper-plate (Hehr, p. 1).</p><p>Werckmeister explains that the intricacies represented by the tuning requirements of his temperament need monochord assistance.  &ldquo;As this way cannot be presented and shown any better to the eyes and ears than through the monochord, I have undertaken this difficult, yet necessary and useful work,&rdquo; and so Werckmeister had a graphic made as a copper-plate print for accurate measurement of musical intervals.</p><p>Throughout &ldquo;Essential Annotations&mldr;,&rdquo; Werckmeister invites the reader to consult his copper-plate Monochordo contained in Musicalische Temperatur in order to &ldquo;find more exact information throughout the proportional numbers&rdquo; (Archambault, p. 225).  The title page of Musicalische Temperatur enlarged the word MONOCORDI for the largest word to reach the eye, with second place going to the word MONOCHORDO.  This indicates that the copper-plate comparisons of tunings was the real draw for the purchase of the work.  The monochord, an ancient tool for measuring musical intervals used throughout Eurasia long before the invention of writing, allowed Neolithic man to take control of sound.[i]  While a monochord only needs a single string, it is through multiple strings that the comparison of intervals is possible.  Essentially, multiple strings of identical pitch have moveable frets placed under them to allow for the actual sounding of mathematical calculations.</p><p>Werckmeister explained that &ldquo;one cannot have nor use the pure concordances in musical practice as they exist in nature, but they must exist in a good temperament (like many other things in nature)&rdquo; (Hehr, p. 2).  He emphasizes the need for a full-size monochord, asking it be capable of being divided into 57,771 parts, &ldquo;because one such short monochord can not be set into so many parts with one circle and even if it were the sharpest subtlest needle-p[oints], still one stitch would always fall in the other&rdquo; (Hehr, p. 106).  Werckmesiter emphasized whole number relationships to preclude the use of fractions for measuring musical intervals.</p><p>For 80/81 is a superparticular proportion and can not be divided into two equal proportions.  If one wanted to bring the entire tempered scale into whole numbers since the commas are divided into third and fourth parts [Werckmeister IV and Werckmeister III, respectively], then the numbers would be so large that one would feel an aversion to them; and also because no usefulness is involved, then the division only happens in a mechanical way (Hehr, p. 59-60).</p><p>            After explaining that one simply cannot have all the consonances available, and after using organ pipes as an example of hearing beats (which he calls tremors, or shakings) in case a student doesn&rsquo;t get to the opportunity to &ldquo;temper an organ-voice,&rdquo; he suggests a try, though more of a trial, to attempt the tuning of &ldquo;a good and stable regal, exercising and learning temperament on the good instrument, for experience is necessary&rdquo; (Archambault, p. 284).  Returning again to the benefits of using the organ as an example, Werckmeister admits &ldquo;it is difficult to exactly differentiate the certainty of the small differences through the ear.&rdquo;  At this point there is the expected reference to &ldquo;our Monochordo&rdquo; in Musicalische Temperatur &ldquo;for different ways of tempering and tuning.&rdquo;</p><p>            What is amazing to those of us in the present is the manner in which Werckmeister attempts a description of equal temperament with the intention of dealing here &ldquo;simply and mechanically, because beginners and many others do not know what a musical comma is.&rdquo;</p><p>All fifths, the highest to the lowest can, namely, vibrate 1/12 comma low; consequently the major thirds become 2/3 too large, the minor thirds &frac34; comma too small, which is all to be endured, if one wished to go through the entire clavier and would treat all songs in all keys (Archambault, p. 285).</p><p>How striking to hear that this theory of tuning would allow us to &ldquo;endure&rdquo; all the<br/>            now effectively playable scales.  It appears telling of his disdain for equal temperament.  Werckmeister may well have thought of equal temperament as more of an idea than an actual tuning system in use.  Immediately, Werckmeister follows that &ldquo;We do not want, however, to think about commas in our instruction, but rather only move on simply as intended, and describe this procedure so that the diatonic-chromatic genus, which is used the most nowadays, remains as pure as possible.&rdquo;  Equal temperament is described here as a simpler approach because it is primarily theory with little expectation of exactitude.  The addition of the words &ldquo;remains as pure as possible&rdquo; indicates that this is a short term method for the clavier in lieu of more serious study of the monochords previously published.  Later, in the Classical period, &ldquo;pure tuning&rdquo; inverts to indicate &ldquo;equally tempered for identical scales&rdquo; (McGeary, p. 94-95).[ii]</p><p>            Werckmeister continues in this same way to be &ldquo;simple&rdquo; with a theory of equal<br/>temperament.  There is no exactitude to a description of the fifth as to &ldquo;vibrate a little<br/>low&rdquo; because Werckmeister has done away with the comma measurements frankly<br/>impossible for his inexperienced audience.  By regularly asking for the flattening of the fifth &ldquo;a little low&rdquo; Werckmeister is assured that it will never be exactly the same amount for each fifth, not at exactly the correct 2 cents flat of today&rsquo;s conventional equal tempered fifth.  Werckmeister:</p><p>To this a, the fifth e1 is again drawn so that it also vibrates a little bit low.  Now one holds this e1 to the c or c1&mdash;if this third c-e1 or c1 and e1 is tolerable, so that the e1 doesn&rsquo;t vibrate too strongly too high, thus the process has been successful, and it is the first test, for all major thirds must vibrate high (against the lower pitch).</p><p>Werckmeister is here anticipating Kirnberger&rsquo;s revelation to Marpurg about how Bach tuned his thirds.  According to Marpurg, Johann Sebastian Bach relayed to Kirnberger, during his instruction with the master that in his tuning all the thirds must be tuned sharp. This is equally true for Werckmeister III tuning with its four variegated sizes of major thirds (each with 6 cents separation from the other).  Werckmeister:</p><p>            If, however, the pitch e1 is all too sharp or high, then the fifths must be corrected a little bit, and lowered, until the e vibrates high tolerably.  If, then, this e1 is correct, then one can proceed, and the e1 make the octave e completely pure.  To this e one tunes again the b, so that it again vibrates low very subtly.  Hereupon one can test the major third as g and b against e, in which b must vibrate a little bit high, as much as the ear can tolerate.  One can also play g, b, d simultaneously, for when the triad is heard, the major third becomes more tolerable.  Therefore the major third g-b is the second test.</p><p>            Werckmeister here anticipates that the &ldquo;na&iuml;ve student&rdquo; (a term he actually uses) will need to readjust pitches.  The most likely reason is that &ldquo;a little bit&rdquo; is none too exact.  It terms of &ldquo;tolerable,&rdquo; Werckmeister does use a major third that is 408 cents wide.  By asking the student to attempt an &ldquo;equal temperament&rdquo; there is less risk that the e will be intolerably high, especially if, as directed, the fledgling clavier tuner starts with the c.  The change of phrase to &ldquo;vibrates low very subtly&rdquo; from &ldquo;vibrates a bit low&rdquo; is circumvented by its preamble, &ldquo;one tunes again.&rdquo;  Werckmeister never tunes to the minor thirds, so he checks the major third g-b, against an e, only to rush ahead to the major triad of g-b-d.</p><p>                To this b, the fifth above can again be taken, as b and f#1, so that the f#1 again vibrates a little bit low against the b.  To this f#1 can f# again be tuned completely purely.  At this point d and f#, or d1 and f#1 can be taken as a test, and f#1 must again vibrate high to the d.  To the f#, the c#1 must again be tuned as a fifth, which likewise must vibrate a little bit low.  To this c#1 one takes a as a test of the major third, the higher pitch of which then again (as all major thirds) must vibrate high against the lower.  To the c#1 the octave c# will again be tune purely, and to this c# the fifth g# can be tuned almost purely</p><p>            This is a bit monotonous, but it is important that each part of the instructions is included or risk suspicion that something has been left out.  Obviously, Werckmeister&rsquo;s instructions to tune pure octaves need not be mentioned each and every time.  And the instructions for the fifth do not change much either.  But the tests, and Werckmeister&rsquo;s repeated admonition that &ldquo;all major thirds&rdquo; are higher is significant to both Werckmeister III tuning, and to Johann Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s tuning revelations to his young theory student Kirnberger.  It should be noted that both Werckmeister&rsquo;s and Bach&rsquo;s aesthetic to completely sacrifice the pure major third was unacceptable to Kirnberger&rsquo;s personal musical aesthetic, which demanded pure &ldquo;just&rdquo; major thirds wherever possible.</p><p>            The test of the g# is e; this third tends, of course, to fall a little sharp, but if one considers using the g# in place of Ab, as f-Ab-c1, it can be no other way.  The fifth d#1 is tuned to the g#.  Then here the d#1 can vibrate a little high to the g#, so that it is tolerably consonant to the b as a major third and to the g1 as a major third.  The octave d# is again purely tuned to the d#1.  On this d# the fifth Bb can again be tuned, which can also vibrate a little high, so that the d1 will be tolerable as the third belonging to it.  To the Bb, the fifth f1 can be taken, again vibrating a little high, or completely pure, after which the f will hold itself as the last point to the c1 or even as the final test, as the major third f and a.  The f, however, is first made pure to the f1, which is then tested to the c1 and a.  If then one or another fifth should be tuned too low or too high, one can always correct it, for the thirds will always sound tolerable, especially because they can tolerate much more than the fifths, because they are not as perfect as the fifths according to their proportions.</p><p>Enharmonic identities would now be introduced for the first time thanks to Andreas Werckmeister, who asked his readers to constitute G# as an Ab for the purpose of comparing the Ab to C.  The confusion possible with multiple names for the same pitch caused Werckmeister to earlier consider doing away with them and sticking to only one straight set of 12 names for 12 pitches.  The frustrating continuance of meantone tuning likely mitigated against this eventuality, among other reasons (such as &ldquo;just intonation&rdquo; theory).  When it is the Bb&rsquo;s turn for discussion, there is no discussion of an A#, nor any discussion of an Eb when the D# is discussed.  And there is always the possibility to readjust the fifths because this simple general equal temperament will accept for the beginner a plethora of major third variations.</p><p>                        Even in his later years of life, Werckmeister was dumbstruck at the obstinacy of individuals insisting on retaining &ldquo;the old hypothesis, that all fifths must be a quarter comma small throughout the entire clavier, and all thirds must be pure.&rdquo;  This time he indicates that the actual practice in contemporary organ tuning is to tune major thirds higher than pure regardless of any meantone ideology an inexperienced tuner might have.  His actual perception of organs tuned during his time was totally contrary to the meantone ideology.</p><p>I have indeed found in their organs that most of the major thirds are too large and vibrate high, which must there be the consequence, and they do not allow it to be done any other way.  Therefore they must, in part, tune only according to their custom, without basis.  It goes as it will, in that they cannot perceive whether the thirds vibrate or not, especially since they cannot always be brought to a tremor (Archambault, p. 290).</p><p>The poor result is an extra-flat &ldquo;fifth,&rdquo; framed by the inefficient attempt to reach quarter comma flat fifths, but shortened too far.  These &ldquo;are so horribly dissonant that one can hardly tolerate them, especially when they are played alone with the addition of the thirds that are tuned a little too low.  No healthy ear would sanction such lame and lazy fifths&rdquo; (Archambault, p.290).  Before leaving this subject, Werckmeister inserts his regular plug for acquiring the more complete method for tuning he described in his copper-plate Monochordo, issued in Musicalische Temperatur.  &ldquo;The truth lies before one&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; made visible through the monochord drawings.<br/>________________________________</p><p>TD:  On the &apos;Septenarius&apos;, if you have read the text, which says explicitly<br/>that the idea of the tuning is not anything to do with comma<br/>fractions, why do you think it is associated with sevenths of a<br/>Pythagorean comma? How do you get from Werckmeister&apos;s intervals to<br/>anywhere near 1/7 PC?</p><p>JR:  I thought I already indicated where I found that, on the Internet.  I&rsquo;ll get you the exact page.  The point for me is that it has been unrelated to my work because there is no example of anyone ever using it.  And there have been lots of different numbers that I have seen for it.</p><p>TD:  No, I haven&apos;t played any music literally in that tuning; but I *have*<br/>played in what I think was a good approximation to it, after the<br/>correction of 176 to 175. That is, the tuning I used had pure, narrow<br/>and wide fifths in the same places. But why is this relevant to the<br/>question of reading the text?</p><p>JR:  It seems we are interested in different things.  And that&rsquo;s fine.  It&rsquo;s what one comes to expect on this list.  We are the Flying Dutchmen of the Yahoo Groups.  J  When someone can inform why this tuning, WVI matters as a real alternative for a piece of music, or why it is important other than as an alternative in construction with a familiarity to other scales, I&rsquo;ll surely give it another look.</p><p>TD:  Why would you think that I was abusing or disrespecting Werckmeister?<br/>JR:  I would hope you were not.  Well, frankly, it&rsquo;s like male bashing, one doesn&rsquo;t know it when it&rsquo;s happening to them, and one doesn&rsquo;t really know it when one is dishing it out.  In truth, Werckmeister is much more important as a personage in the development of music than is properly attributed to him.  He was not one in a myriad, he was the catalyst for a rational and reproducible tuning method that offered different things to those with different aesthetics, or compositional needs.  The only difference between us here is that I think WIII became the orthodoxy for tuning in Bach&rsquo;s music.<br/>TD: I consider that in his texts he spoke *for himself*:<br/>JR:  This is, alas, unfortunately unfair for the actual reality; his writings are only in recent times (my lifetime) being translated out of reproductions of plates.  There has not even been a modern German translation.  As a result, the invested interest in believing Bach was equal temperament was laid at the feet Werckmeister&rsquo;s &ldquo;constant indecision.&rdquo;  There is a different explanation that is being offered.<br/>TD:  and one should at<br/>least consider the possibility that other people - for example Bach<br/>and his uncles - could have had other, valid, opinions.</p><p>JR:  Tom, I love fantasy, and science fiction.  Man, I really enjoy the big blockbusters when them come out.  But you are mixing Bach with fantasy, as have many others.  You have talk about this area much as an Egyptologist speaks about ancient Egypt.

It&apos;s been fun focusing on Bach again.</p><p>NH:  Hey, no huge deal, but since we were talking about Bach, I thought this would be interesting. I was going through some of my classical guitar music, and found the &quot;Prelude, Fugue, and Allegro,&quot; (in Eb); on the title page (of the original score) it says &quot;Prelude for Lute o Cembal par J.S. Bach.&quot;<br/>It&apos;s also written in bass and treble clef; but, since Bach intended it for either instrument, I wonder how his keyboard was tuned while he wrote it? If in Werck, than why also intend it for an axe in 12 eq, since the effect of the piece would be altered by switching tunings.</p><p>JR: Neil, Werckmeister III is many tunings in one.  Eb major is quite close to exact equal temperament, at worst only six cents different from an equal temperament pitch:</p><p>0         96  204  294  402  498  594  702  798  906  996  1098</p><p>NH:  And, according to editor Michael Lorimer, there were &quot;awkward and uncomfortable fingerings,&quot; which, he said, would never occur in the works of a lutenist, like Weiss. Same thing happened with the solo violin sonatas, there were passages that were not playable as written on a violin (those pieces fit the guitar perfectly).</p><p>JR:  Not sure what you are trying to say here.  This seems outside of a tuning question.  Bad modulations, not made by the composer, are always dangerous.  Yet good players can always beat the odds.  Man, I play more fingerings than most bassoonists ever imagined.  Microtones take you there.  The adjustments needed for instruments to make back then were normal.  The tuning that the orchestra (post-Brandenburg) would use is an extended concept of mirroring keys on different tonic tones, which is extended meantone.</p><p>Sorry to disagree with Tom (but not disagreeable), but sixth comma meantone is really quite easy to hear.  I&rsquo;ve played sixth comma many, many times, most recently this past March.  The tuning is exact in the mind, as any tuning should be.  The theoreticals mean little in light of actually playing the shit.  One must lock it, which one good reason for the baroque continuo.  But the continuo is training wheels that Mozart and Haydn through off.</p><p>NH:  And, &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; doesn&apos;t even specify an instrument, so how do you tune it?</p><p>JR:  It&rsquo;s not relevant.  Always tune starting on the note C in the Baroque, allowing the close keys to C to be the most just, and the extreme chromatic keys as closer to Pythagorean pitch interval models.  No matter the instrument, the tuning would be the same.</p><p>NH:  I&apos;ve often wondered if Bach was hearing things in his head that transcended ANY instrument, and if he wanted to hear music in pure tunings, and found the tempered systems available to him very limited?</p><p>JR:  Um, Bach is the arch temperament fan.  He&rsquo;s &ldquo;famous&rdquo; for insisting that every major third be sharp to just (Kirnberger), which is just so in Werckmeister III tuning (but not in Kirnberger&rsquo;s own tuning).  In an analysis I did of Bach&rsquo;s opening intervals in his famous works, I found that for all the pure perfect fifths and perfect fourths available in Werckmeister III tuning, NONE was ever used.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

My experience(s) in performance tell a different story.<br/>TD:  (And what&apos;s so theoretically good about 1/6 comma?

Learning notes is the way all musicians learn to work with music.  As they advance, they begin to understand that they are actually playing intervals.  Werckmeister III offers 39 different intervals, while other well-temperaments offer other large numbers of &ldquo;expressive&rdquo; intervals.<br/>TD:  For any instrument except a keyboard, that seems to me very inefficient.<br/>JR:  The multitude of pitches/intervals depending on the system provides the great variety.  Vibrato does not work in the earlier tunings for various reasons.  But the keyboard does not bend and all baroque performance involves keyboard&mldr;so, no fudging.<br/>TD:  You have a big continuous pitch spectrum which can be used to try and<br/>produce satisfying chords with the other guys, but something &apos;exact&apos;<br/>within your mind tells you that only such and such discrete pitches<br/>can be correct? I find this difficult to accept as music-making.<br/>JR:  It sounds to me that you cannot accept that one could like different temperings.  My position is that of being honest to the period.  I do not want to change them into a modern aesthetic, or even a different Baroque aesthetic.  Werckmeister III honestly fits the bill.  There has not been any better argument.</p><p>&gt; One must lock it, which one good reason for the baroque continuo.</p><p>TD:  Why? What Pandora&apos;s box of dire consequences would result from<br/>violinists or bassoonists deviating from some given meantone?</p><p>JR:  Darn, it&rsquo;s awful sounding!  Would you like different players to be sliding around in just intonation?  It&rsquo;s bad with temperament, too.  Please give a listen to the PITCH Early CD.  I&rsquo;ll make one available to you for free.  But hey, there are other recordings&mldr;only they are so few.</p><p>&gt; the continuo is training wheels that Mozart and Haydn threw off.</p><p>TD:  I find it difficult to believe that that the continuo was an exact<br/>intonational guide for all instrumentalists. First, continuo<br/>instruments are relatively difficult to match to exactly during<br/>performance.<br/>JR:  I&rsquo;m not here to convince you.  Anecdotally, my AFMM Ensemble fights to be near the harpsichord in performances.  By using scotch tape to change the intonation of the alto recorder, I can be right on with the harpsichord in Brandenburg #2.<br/>TD:  Typically they would consist of an Italian harpsichord<br/>and/or chamber organ.

But hearing any single exact pitch, even if by a plucked string, is still exact in the musician&rsquo;s mind.  It may require more quiet in the hall, but a pitch frequency is a pitch frequency.<br/>TD:  So just acoustically, melody instruments would have been allowed a<br/>surprising degree of freedom to deviate from the tempered keyboard<br/>tuning, without it necessarily sounding bad.</p><p>JR:  This sounds more like a modern singer crooning to a piano.  Sorry to be stating certain statements so often, but it&rsquo;s just not true in my musical experience.  I play a flexible instrument and I teach other instrumentalists and vocalists.  We work by the cent, to the best extent as the player can.  The true color is in the tone used, not in its distance from a targeted tone (like Romanticism&rsquo;s leading tones).  Wrong century.</p><p>TD:  Also, there are some rules for continuo which seem designed to<br/>preserve this freedom: for example the melody line should not be<br/>doubled at the unison by the continuo player, and especially not when<br/>it has a 4-3 suspension.

Sure, the harpsichordist would have to leave out all thirds if everyone else was trying to be just.<br/>TD:  In fact, that is what I would consider most likely for Baroque<br/>intonation practice. The bass instrument, which must be in unison with<br/>the continuo left hand, does play mainly in some kind of meantone.

Hence they would be in<br/>agreement with harmonics of the bass-line and, clearly, with each<br/>other.<br/>JR:  I&rsquo;ve heard this dream from others before, but it doesn&rsquo;t work.  And more importantly, it didn&rsquo;t happen.  I did this with Otto Luening&rsquo;s Sonata for Bassoon, with his permission.  Luening had actually imagined this kind of harmonic treatment for his piece.  But Bach, ridiculous.  Wercmeister III well-temperament was his controlled interavallic palette.  Meantone is so exact to the ear of the musician working with it, that to move off of it sounds sour.<br/>TD:  The tempered intervals of RH continuo chords are then only an<br/>imperfect first approximation to what the melodists can play.</p><p>JR:  Gee, I don&rsquo;t think they would take kindly to this sort of description.</p><p>TD:  Just to clarify, if the continuo RH plays a note which is impure with<br/>the bass, then beats ensue and the melody instrument has a *choice* :<br/>either play purely with the RH note, or with the bass.

It could better be<br/>&gt;     demonstated face to face with musical examples.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Since at least the 1960&apos;s (Wesley Kuhnle&apos;s recorded lecture-demonstrations date from the 1950&apos;s), it has been common practice for Harpsichordists to tune their own instruments in historical tunings, rather than leave the tuning to professional piano tuner. Meantone and  WIII, followed by KIII  are the tunings that most players learn first and are certainly used in concert by harpsichordists far more that ET.  So we have now had abundant &quot;experiental (sic) knowledge&quot; with WIII as a tuning for both solo and continuo usage.  On the basis of the experience it is far from necessary to become a &quot;true believer&quot;  (the world has dangerously far too many &quot;true believers&quot; at the moment AFAIC) to make a rational assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the tuning.  It certainly works well enough for much solo literature and can be worked-with in ensemble situations. Is it always an optimal tuning? Certainly not, but it is frequently a good compromise. Is its historical status, in particular as a tuning for Bach&apos;s music, certain? Certainly not. There is simply no detailed positive evidence to indicate that this particular harpsichord tuning or another was widespread in practice, and Bach did not leave unambiguous and detailed tuning instruction of his own or endorse the tuning of another musician. There is also no good evidence, positive or negative, regarding the entirely plausible notion that harpsichordists would have liberally used their tuning hammers when moving from piece to piece.  We do know that Bach played organs in 1/6 comma tuning, and he wrote music for both gamba and lute, presumably in ET (although there is some evidence that these instruments with moveable frets could be a bit more flexible with their intonation, certainly an advantage in continuo environments).  Any attempt to advocate a particular historical or conjectural tuning is also going to have to get around the complicated subject of transposition and pitch level.  The former was common practice, particular in arrangements, and the latter can get quite thorny as not only did pitch level vary from locality to locality and within a locality from organ to organ, it is difficult to assume that usage of these organs in ensemble situations required complete new sets of instruments. (The F trumpet in the 2nd Brandenburg may well be an example in which an ensemble is synthesized from instruments from different pitch standards).</p><p>Finally, and this is strictly a personal opinion, I find that we are in a very lively intonational environment with regard to contemporary performances of early repertoire.  Not only does one encounter a wide variety of keyboard intonations in concerts these days -- historical, conjectural, and rather individualized variations on the two --, the best ensembles now have the flexibility to tune as clearly or ambiguously to the continuo as they like, and avoiding intonational conflicts is no longer the sole musical objective. This is a move very much in parallel to the realisation that now that we have become good at eliminating vibrato altogether, it can now become a useful expressive and ornamental element when applied intentional and discretely.   Indeed, like vibrato, intonational cloudiness or ambiguity is a quality of its own. It&apos;s all a matter of not being a &quot;true believer&quot; in one particular doctrine or another, but rather in the full diversity of musical resources and expressions.  Anything less is a disservice to music.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2006 9:36:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel has given some very needful reminders about the real nature of<br/>our historical knowledge (such as it is).</p><p>Although I agree with almost everything, I had a couple of questions<br/>or objections :</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  We do know that Bach<br/>&gt; played organs in 1/6 comma tuning,</p><p>I assume that is based on the old attribution of 1/6-comma meantone<br/>(with an unspecified comma) as &apos;Silbermann&apos;.

There is lots of familiarity with the tuning through Bach&apos;s rich association with Muhlhausen and the Werckmeister III tuner, Johann Friedrich Wender.</p><p>Now, we do differ that tuning was not important to Mr. Bach.  It was consumately important; JS was singlehandedly presenting the Musical World with the principles of well-temperament as a tuning wherein each note can be a tonic for a key with its own sentiment and allusions.</p><p>Only one tuning was every described that could influence Bach, Werckmeister III.  And yet, as Aaron and Carl suggest, Bach probably could have used just about anything.  Sorry, you could challenge what I&apos;m saying, but you cannot take away the conclusionary feeling I have after a lifetime.</p><p>Tuning, speaking as a performing musician, is a cultural manifestation.   Aaron and Carl, I differ with you, two, because somehow Bach is being confused with being an individual.  He was not, in my opinion.  He followed the guidelines of his uncle, and his oldest son, and his oldest brother, etc.</p><p>Tough cookies, but I&apos;m going to speculate.  Werckmeister was quite familiar with the tuning used by Bach&apos;s first major teacher, uncle johann Christoph Bach.  That&apos;s why Werckmeister starts with it in his estimation, even though he himself doesn&apos;t need it (because he is not a chromatic composer).</p><p>Buxtehude was music in that generation before Bach and he clearly supported Werckmesiter.  Even more so were the Ahles and Mr. Wender of Muhlhausen.  Muhlhausen was the center of the tuning world.  It is where Werckmeister&apos;s ideas received its greatest impetus.  Even Werckmeister&apos;s own son took over in Quedlinberg with &quot;Werckmeister IV&quot;.</p><p>The point is that Werckmeister passes muster as the most likely candidate for performing the music of JS Bach due to his proximity to Muhlhausen and to his family recipe, likely manifested in the teachings of the uncle JC.</p><p>best, johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

Bach tuned fairly near to equal<br/>temperament at that contest - otherwise it would have sounded *worse*<br/>than Neidhardt&apos;s near-ET in some keys. One simple possibility is that<br/>JN Bach tuned ET by ear better than Neidhardt did by monochord.</p><p>J:          I was with you up till the Bb minor info.   But there is no &ldquo;We&rdquo; in this deduction.  It seemed that Aaron (and maybe Carl and Gene) signed off on Neidhardt.  Wrapping around the enigma that is Bach takes some doing.  I thought it better to rope off areas of the conversation so we can focus.</p><p>As for assuming JN Bach was almost ET&mldr;well, this may betray more of your 21st century aesthetic, than it could be that of a Bach.    Your suggested &ldquo;simple possibility&rdquo; &mldr;tuning ET by ear as better, even yet, preferable&mldr; goes against every sinew in my physiogamy.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How in the world could anyone claim Neidhardt influenced the tuning<br/>&gt; of J.S. Bach if the above is true?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can&apos;t.</p><p>T:         How can anyone in the world claim that Neidhardt *didn&apos;t* influence<br/>the tuning of J.S. Bach?  You can&apos;t. Lack of evidence cuts both ways.</p><p>J:          Chronologically, it can&rsquo;t work.  JS was a master of the organ and its tuning when he judged the Wender creation in Arnstadt in 1703.  JS was established in his chromatic tuning at this time, with Neidhardt a much later phenomenon.</p><p>            If you have evidence that Wender did not practice Werckmeister III tuning, as to insist upon it for chromatic usage, please do tell.</p><p>            And very striking, Werckmeister III was essentially a Thuringian tuning.  Sorry to pull the race card, but Neidhardt went from Silesia to south of Thuringia (Altdorf) to far north Saxon-Anhalt (Wittemberg), before focusing on theology, where he met JN Bach.   Bach&rsquo;s tuning was one of a family, but of a bigger family, one that takes in the full culture of Thuringia.  There were Bach&rsquo;s everywhere, but they all kept to a musical well-temperament.  Now, all well-temperaments sound more alike to modern day ears than any one well-temperament sounds in comparison to ET.   Due to the circumstances surrounding the publishing of a popular treatise on the organ and a companion for tuning it, unlike anything of its kind, at least until Neidhardt in 1706, the musical basis for choosing a well temperament goes to Werckmeister III.  There is nothing else justifiable, in my opinion.</p><p>T:         To add to the information presented by Johnny, which only refers to<br/>Neidhardt&apos;s early efforts with ET : Neidhardt later presented many<br/>*irregular* temperament recipes, which he must have developed between<br/>1706 and 1724 or later. Did he get any helpful hints from JN Bach in<br/>preparing them?</p><p>J:          I&rsquo;m sure Niedhardt was influenced, at least as regards perfecting his science of tempering.  And this was admirable.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or does one need more proof that JS Bach was established in a tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; for life since childhood?</p><p>T:         I don&apos;t understand this question. Where is the first proof, never mind<br/>&apos;one more&apos;? Bach, who checked the tuning of his harpsichords daily,<br/>did so the same way for (say) forty years? That&apos;s 14,400 tunings. Yet<br/>that is what is claimed. &apos;Bach was established in a tuning for life<br/>since childhood&apos;. Just think about what this means and what one would<br/>need to &apos;prove&apos; it.</p><p>J:          Good.  You are dealing with an important question.  I do believe this.  Proving it is always a different matter.  I aim to try.</p><p>T:         Where is one piece of direct evidence as to what Bach did with respect<br/>to tuning harpsichords in his &apos;childhood&apos; (though in 1706 he was<br/>already 21)?</p><p>J:          Red herrings, for me.  Keyboard is keyboard.  I don&rsquo;t accept that the tuning is meant to be different on a harpsichord than on an organ.  Werckmeister III, with its 8 pure fifths sound great on a harpsichord, certain fantastic in relation to ET.</p><p>            One piece of evidence is that both Werckmeister and JS are said to be able to tune a harpsichord in 15 minutes, something which was clearly meant to be an amazing feat of speed and accuracy.</p><p>T:         OK, I stop now. Just to note that it is very easy to select a few<br/>facts out of a huge pile of more or less useful information to &apos;make a<br/>case&apos;. For example, for the Werckmeister 1698 continuo tuning, which<br/>is different from all the 1691 temperaments.</p><p>J:          Careful study shows there is no change in Werckmeister&rsquo;s views that 1691 is his full view on the subject.  This has been shown on this List before.</p><p>T:         This is connected to Bach<br/>in two ways (documented in the Norrback book): one, it was found<br/>copied out in the documents of an organist-composer relation of his;<br/>two, it was also copied into the proceedings of the Leipzig<br/>music-theory society founded by Mizler ... Caveat lector.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>J:          This is juicy; what was copied out?  &ldquo;I, Andreas Werckmeister, have changed my mind.&rdquo;?

Face it, that quote is directly contradictory to Bach&apos;s using<br/>&gt; &gt; WIII.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron: As you already know, I strongly agree with your assessment<br/>here, and I<br/>&gt; find it hard to believe anyone would defend WerckIII as the strongest<br/>&gt; possible Bach tuning, based on this fact alone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: Ah, and you are misinterpreting.  Check the response to<br/>Daniel Wolf for the details.  I would want to just go on.......</p><p>Aaron: I dont think I&apos;m misinterpreting. I think you are so stuck on<br/>Werck III, you will read anything that points against it as a<br/>&apos;misinterpretation&apos;. You&apos;ve lost all objectivity.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron:  On top of this, we<br/>&gt; have other facts, which I have stated elsewhere. Bach himself thought<br/>&gt; Kirnberger&apos;s tuning rather simplistic,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Bull. The source for this is where?  Kirnberger&apos;s<br/>improvements came with a new paradigm: music would now be considered<br/>foremost from a new, verical point of view, rather than by the<br/>previous Baroque counterpoint.  Um, did you study the difference<br/>between the Baroque and the Classical periods?</p><p>Aaron: your obvious hot-headed sarcasm aside, although I can&apos;t sing an<br/>interval of one cent as well as you can, so I&apos;ve heard (or not), I did<br/>study music history. I&apos;m not aware of a complete quantum leap anywhere<br/>in music history. Please make your case stronger with an example that<br/>there ever was one. Debussy is about as close as I can think, and even<br/>there, there are precidents in Wagner, a strong influence on the early<br/>Debussy. People don&apos;t wake up on January 1st (or July 29th 1750 as we<br/>are talking here) and say &quot;hmmm...now a vertical music&quot;...true, Bach<br/>was considered old fashioned by some (including sons), using older<br/>forms (ricercar, etc.) but he was aware of the newer galant style<br/>himself. And what of all the futuristic, yet simultaneously<br/>backward-looking counterpoint of Beethoven, especially in the late<br/>period? Are we to play him in WerckIII, because as you said somewhere<br/>&quot;Each line has a greater etching, and more recognizeability&quot;. Hogwash!<br/>It seems the more chromatic the music, the closer the WT should<br/>approach ET, not the other way. Bach was a very chromatic composer at<br/>times, almost mannerist at times. WerckIII is really a<br/>half-in-the-meantone world temperament, not really able to stomach the<br/>gargoyles of Bach&apos;s more tortured lines (think of the b-minor fugue in<br/>WTC-I), almost a 12-tone row! I&apos;ve played this in WerckIII, and it<br/>doesn&apos;t really convince.</p><p>&gt; Aaron:  ...and Werckmesiter is not all<br/>&gt; that much more complex than Kirnberger...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  What does this mean?  It is&apos;nt making any sense to<br/>me...complex in what sense(s)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron:  ...plus CPE Bach, his SON, said<br/>&gt; &quot;temper MOST fifths&quot;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Please see above about the revoultionary change in music in<br/>the Classical period.  Some would say that Europe waited ten years<br/>simply for JS Bach to die.  More to the point, why was CPE sly about<br/>his tuning?  But CPE didn&apos;t tune organs.</p><p>Aaron: Hmmm---Johnny alter-ego said this in:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/65736">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/65736</a></p><p>&quot;But a keyboard tuning is a keyboard tuning.  There is no difference,<br/>except that the organ tuning has to be more exact due to the sustain<br/>and expense of the organ tuning.  It is a red herring to claim<br/>otherwise.  While WIII is described first in Orgelprobe, it appears<br/>later in his Musicalishe Temperatur.  A keyboard, is a keyboard, is a<br/>keyboard. And Baroque music involved keyboard in virtually EVERY piece<br/>written.&quot;</p><p>So which is it? Does organ vs. harpsichord matter? And perhaps he was<br/>sly because he didn&apos;t want to directly reveal a family secret....you<br/>know, like Indian families hide spice mixtures for their dishes.</p><p>There&apos;s a piece called,&apos;musikalische Opfer&apos;, where there are puzzle<br/>canons, and Bach gives little vague verbal hints about how to solve<br/>them. Bach loved puzzles. It seems COMPLETELY consistent with his<br/>character to hide a family teperament in plain sight, but only sly<br/>dogs could see it.</p><p>&gt; Aaron:  and Neidhardt (and Sorge), sorry Johnny, you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; have to prove that he wasn&apos;t developing their temperaments years<br/>&gt; before publishing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: ...ad nauseum to you.  I have nothing to prove, certainly<br/>not to you.  As far as I know, you are an obnoxious composer with no<br/>Bach scholarship.</p><p>Aaron: No need to resort to groundless nasty ad hominem attacks,<br/>unless of course, you are out of convincing arguments. I&apos;ve played the<br/>entire WTC, many of the English and French Suites, and Partitas, the<br/>entire Goldbergs, most of the 2-part inventions, much organ music from<br/>Orgelbuchlien, the Italian Concerto, the C major concerto for two<br/>harpsichords, Musical Offering, the list goes on. In short I have a<br/>very, very large Bach repertoire compared to most. I have a master&apos;s<br/>degree in Piano Performance from Northwestern, and a Bachelor&apos;s degree<br/>from SUNY Purchase. The faculties at both schools voted unanimously to<br/>offer me special graduate honors as the top keyboard musician in my<br/>class. I&apos;ve read, twice, &apos;The Bach Reader&apos;, and countless articles and<br/>papers on Bach. I&apos;ve done Schenkerian analysis on his music under a<br/>great Schenker teacher at Queens college and Julliard. I&apos;ve lived and<br/>breathed a great deal of Bach. I don&apos;t have to prove anything to you.<br/>If you don&apos;t like my composition, fair enough, it&apos;s not going to<br/>discourage me, rather encourage me.</p><p>Johnny: Once again I pose a question: if you were to perform<br/>Brandenberg Concerto #2 professionally, what temperament do you<br/>choose?  A decision HAS to be made for anything to happen.  I choose<br/>Werckmeister III because I believe he used it.  Is that okay with you?</p><p>Aaron: Sure---no problem. I personally, and many others too, just<br/>don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best possible one. I would think, based on the<br/>evidence, the key color shifts are more subtle. You don&apos;t have to<br/>agree with me; go on and do what turns you on as an artist. But don&apos;t<br/>claim you are trying to establish something objective about Bach,<br/>that&apos;s all.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron:  There is also this article I came across today, which makes<br/>a stronger<br/>&gt; case to me than Lehman&apos;s does:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  ...to me the squiggle thing is lame.  But is seems<br/>completely natural that you would be fascinated by them.  By all<br/>means, enjoy.</p><p>Aaron: Again, royally ad hominem nastyness. You insult more the league<br/>of folks who have done much work on that topic. Ask yourself--what is<br/>the probability that there should be 12 squiggles, a few having two<br/>twists, a few having one, and a few having none, NOT describing some<br/>sort of 12-note tuning scheme, on the title page of a set of pieces<br/>*designed* to illustrate the benefits of a circulating temperament? I<br/>would say very, very, small. I think it&apos;s an ingenious insight on the<br/>part of Andreas Sparschuh&apos;s (and others). Also, when interpreted as<br/>such, they fall RIGHT IN LINE with the characteristics of temperaments<br/>from the era, further casting doubt aside, except yours obviously,<br/>which I can only read as, frankly, jealousy.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2007 7:25:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>SNIP</p><p> Bach was a very chromatic composer at<br/>&gt; times, almost mannerist at times.

But if Bach&apos;s goal had been to do equal temperament<br/>&gt; or something so close as to almost indistinguishable, and not to<br/>&gt; openly use key color, why would he have written WTC when such an<br/>&gt; obvious and, in this case, far more impressive possibility is so<br/>&gt; obvious? Once you get within a certain distance of equal<br/>&gt; temperament, your modulations can include every key within one<br/>&gt; piece, and pretty rapidly at that.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s kind of my point---he did write the piece to demonstrate<br/>that you could play any prelude and fugue from it followed by any<br/>other without retuning!</p><p>&gt; &gt; As for &apos;smelly sexuality&apos;, I think  there is more to that than<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning---Stravinsky did fine making outright orgiastic music in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;Rite&apos;--and that&apos;s 12-equal. Ditto Scriabin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never heard ROS in 12-equal, but I haven&apos;t heard recent<br/>&gt; recordings. In old recordings it&apos;s only 12-equal on paper, like<br/>&gt; every other orchestral work. Besides, there&apos;s timbral excitment in<br/>&gt; spades. On a 12-equal piano there would only be rhythmic excitement.</p><p>Hmm...well, there&apos;s enough rhythmic excitement alone for me not to<br/>care about the temperament!</p><p>&gt; Scriabin? New recordings are Muzak, unlistenble to me, haven&apos;t heard<br/>&gt; it in a serious concert. Do you really think that 12-equal was<br/>&gt; happening 100 years ago in Russia? Korsakov&apos;s comments on key colors<br/>&gt; certainly don&apos;t suggest that.</p><p>Hard to say. Messiaen also had synasthesia, and he certainly was<br/>playing on 12-equal organs.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Interesting that<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonies really opened up to the suggestion of higher harmonics,<br/>&gt; &gt; apparantly while you think they are being &apos;tamed&apos; by 12-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s just a desperate- and failed- attempt to make a boring thing<br/>&gt; less boring.</p><p>I can&apos;t agree. I love lots of 12-equal music that uses rich harmonies,<br/>in particular look at Impressionaist to Modern classical, and then the<br/>jazz masters. Art Tatum&apos;s harmonical vocabulary is not in the least<br/>bit &apos;confined&apos; by 12-equal, in my estimation.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Nor does equal temperament facilitate modulation- it largely<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;reduces<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; modulation to mere transposition.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t this a semantic bait-and-switch?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nope. :-) The words have meanings, or once did and should again.</p><p>Well, for my part, &apos;mere transposition&apos; is really not doing justice to<br/>a powerful tool in music!</p><p>&gt; &gt;But I know what you mean, I<br/>&gt; &gt; think---less key color. I agree that that is true, but I also think<br/>&gt; &gt; that composer&apos;s conception *led to this*, starting with the ultra<br/>&gt; &gt; circulating chromatic music of Bach. I&apos;m not saying that WerckIII<br/>&gt; &gt;flat<br/>&gt; &gt; out doesn&apos;t work for chromatic music---I&apos;m saying that the evidence<br/>&gt; &gt; appears to be that it wasn&apos;t enough for the 18th century to end<br/>&gt; &gt; there---otherwise they would have stopped looking for ways to<br/>&gt; &gt;temper<br/>&gt; &gt; the key contrast, and stopped looking for better temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible to look at the development of 12-equal<br/>&gt; outside the context of the Age of Revolutions, the Industrial<br/>&gt; Revolution and the rise of the &quot;middle class&quot;.</p><p>And, what, you think these things were bad somehow?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Remember that 12-equal goes back longer than we commonly think,<br/>&gt; &gt; too---lute, viol music. A historical period can have many complex<br/>&gt; &gt; facets, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly. But straight frets does not necessarily equal equal<br/>&gt; temperament if the music is all in a few keys- what percentage of<br/>&gt; lute music modulates widely or even leaves a handful of keys?</p><p>I&apos;m not an expert on lute music---only I&apos;ve heard that lutes are<br/>typically constructed like modern guitar in 12-equal...although I<br/>vaguely remember hearing about adjustable frets, which I know I&apos;ve<br/>heard/seen on viols....any lute experts want to chime in?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The arts of the past have been outrageously bowdlerized for the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 200 years.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You are right, but I think in the case of Bach he is watershed---<br/>&gt; &gt;still<br/>&gt; &gt; close enough to modern 12-equal thought that his music works quite<br/>&gt; &gt; well in it, but is a bit duller. I would think in that case the<br/>&gt; &gt;spirit<br/>&gt; &gt; of the performer is more important and brings more to it than the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning would.<br/>&gt; &gt;IOW, I&apos;d rather listen to amazing Bach playing in<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-equal than pedestrian Bach playing in WT of choice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmmm...well we&apos;ve all heard Bach played wonderfully in 12-equal, and<br/>&gt; you know? I don&apos;t have the slightest urge to hear it again. Ever.</p><p>Hmm...that&apos;s too bad! ;)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I guess how subjectively spicy one likes Bach is the issue. I think<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s fair to say that some would like hearing Bach spicier than<br/>&gt; &gt;Bach<br/>&gt; &gt; would have liked (and who knows just how he liked it?), and that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My only beef with WIII is that it isn&apos;t spicy enough- and I only<br/>&gt; have one child, not 22. :-)</p><p>Well, you like-a-de-strong-pepper-taco then!</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>1/11/2007 8:51:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Aaron,</p><p>Permit me to answer a few points in a non-incendiary way.

You&apos;ve lost all objectivity.</p><p>Johnny:  Let us just say we see things differently.  Many composers have used a single tuning throughout their lifetimes.  These include Stravinsky, Debussy, Wagner, Scriabin (except for an obscure fascination with a particular just intonation chord).  Could it not be possible that JS Bach was a cocky composer that could actually stick to his tuning throughout his lifetime?  His tuning is not held hostage by things that came later.</p><p>Aaron: I dont think I&apos;m misinterpreting. I think you are so stuck on<br/>Werck III, you will read anything that points against it as a<br/>&apos;misinterpretation&apos;. You&apos;ve lost all objectivity.</p><p>Johnny:  Let us keep things intellectually honest by reading each point for what it says, and not for what we would wish it to say.  That&rsquo;s really what all this is about.  Honestly, you don&rsquo;t think your musical conceptions as a professional pianist influenced you understanding of music?  Mine are formed by being a bassoonist.  It&rsquo;s different.  Didn&rsquo;t you see the South Park episode with the 3 different atheism groups that were declaring annihilation on each other because they had a different basis for their science.  One group was made of intellectual otters!  Perfect correspondence.  Sorry you felt you had to give out your biography.  But it does help.</p><p>Aaron:  Bach was a very chromatic composer at<br/>times, almost mannerist at times. WerckIII is really a<br/>half-in-the-meantone world temperament, not really able to stomach the<br/>gargoyles of Bach&apos;s more tortured lines (think of the b-minor fugue in<br/>WTC-I), almost a 12-tone row! I&apos;ve played this in WerckIII, and it<br/>doesn&apos;t really convince.</p><p>Johnny:  I completely agree with Cameron on this on all he said.  The 12ET comparison to WIII is to my view irrelevant.  The real issue is how can we make modern performances of JS Bach as informative as possible.  With ET an entire dimension of listening is lost.</p><p>&gt; Johnny: Please see above about the revolutionary change in music in<br/>the Classical period. Some would say that Europe waited ten years<br/>simply for JS Bach to die. More to the point, why was CPE sly about<br/>his tuning? But CPE didn&apos;t tune organs.</p><p>Aaron: Hmmm---Johnny alter-ego said this in:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/65736">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/65736</a></p><p>&quot;But a keyboard tuning is a keyboard tuning. There is no difference,<br/>except that the organ tuning has to be more exact due to the sustain<br/>and expense of the organ tuning. It is a red herring to claim<br/>otherwise. While WIII is described first in Orgelprobe, it appears<br/>later in his Musicalishe Temperatur. A keyboard, is a keyboard, is a<br/>keyboard. And Baroque music involved keyboard in virtually EVERY piece<br/>written.&quot;</p><p>Johnny:   Perhaps you did not understand me.  Because the organ is locked in, the harpsichord and all other keyboard/clavier, would be in the tuning of the organs.  That is if one believes, as I do, that JS used one tuning for all his music, a preferred well temperament, if you will, then his keyboard tunings would mimic his organ tuning.  The vagueness of CPE leads me to believe that he, indeed, may have been more flexible.  W.F. Bach was likely a meantone composer based on the compositions he wrote, were written for him, and by the cities which he worked (Dresden, Halle, Berlin).</p><p>It seems you misunderstood me again about the question I had been posing:</p><p>&ldquo;Johnny: Once again I pose a question: if you were to perform<br/>Brandenberg Concerto #2 professionally, what temperament do you<br/>choose? A decision HAS to be made for anything to happen. I choose<br/>Werckmeister III because I believe he used it. Is that okay with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aaron: Sure---no problem. I personally, and many others too, just<br/>don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best possible one. I would think, based on the<br/>evidence, the key color shifts are more subtle. You don&apos;t have to<br/>agree with me; go on and do what turns you on as an artist. But don&apos;t<br/>claim you are trying to establish something objective about Bach,<br/>that&apos;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>Johnny:  Each Brandenberg Concerto is in a different key.  The problem of key shifts seems negligible.  I am asking &ldquo;if&rdquo; you would make a choice for a different tuning or the same tuning for each of the Brandenbergs, and &ldquo;if&rdquo; you have an alternative, a SPECIFIC alternative to WIII.  If not, and if you do not choose ET, then does the music just not get played?</p><p>Johnny</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

One group<br/>was made of intellectual otters!  Perfect correspondence.  Sorry you<br/>felt you had to give out your biography.  But it does help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron:  Bach was a very chromatic composer at<br/>&gt; times, almost mannerist at times. WerckIII is really a<br/>&gt; half-in-the-meantone world temperament, not really able to stomach the<br/>&gt; gargoyles of Bach&apos;s more tortured lines (think of the b-minor fugue in<br/>&gt; WTC-I), almost a 12-tone row! I&apos;ve played this in WerckIII, and it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t really convince.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  I completely agree with Cameron on this on all he said.<br/>The 12ET comparison to WIII is to my view irrelevant.  The real issue<br/>is how can we make modern performances of JS Bach as informative as<br/>possible.  With ET an entire dimension of listening is lost.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Johnny: Please see above about the revolutionary change in music in<br/>&gt; the Classical period. Some would say that Europe waited ten years<br/>&gt; simply for JS Bach to die. More to the point, why was CPE sly about<br/>&gt; his tuning? But CPE didn&apos;t tune organs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron: Hmmm---Johnny alter-ego said this in:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/65736">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/65736</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;But a keyboard tuning is a keyboard tuning. There is no difference,<br/>&gt; except that the organ tuning has to be more exact due to the sustain<br/>&gt; and expense of the organ tuning. It is a red herring to claim<br/>&gt; otherwise. While WIII is described first in Orgelprobe, it appears<br/>&gt; later in his Musicalishe Temperatur. A keyboard, is a keyboard, is a<br/>&gt; keyboard. And Baroque music involved keyboard in virtually EVERY piece<br/>&gt; written.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:   Perhaps you did not understand me.  Because the organ is<br/>locked in, the harpsichord and all other keyboard/clavier, would be in<br/>the tuning of the organs.  That is if one believes, as I do, that JS<br/>used one tuning for all his music, a preferred well temperament, if<br/>you will, then his keyboard tunings would mimic his organ tuning.  The<br/>vagueness of CPE leads me to believe that he, indeed, may have been<br/>more flexible.  W.F. Bach was likely a meantone composer based on the<br/>compositions he wrote, were written for him, and by the cities which<br/>he worked (Dresden, Halle, Berlin).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems you misunderstood me again about the question I had been<br/>posing:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &acirc;Johnny: Once again I pose a question: if you were to perform<br/>&gt; Brandenberg Concerto #2 professionally, what temperament do you<br/>&gt; choose? A decision HAS to be made for anything to happen. I choose<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III because I believe he used it. Is that okay with you?&acirc;&#x9D;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &acirc;Aaron: Sure---no problem. I personally, and many others too, just<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best possible one. I would think, based on the<br/>&gt; evidence, the key color shifts are more subtle. You don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; agree with me; go on and do what turns you on as an artist. But don&apos;t<br/>&gt; claim you are trying to establish something objective about Bach,<br/>&gt; that&apos;s all.&acirc;&#x9D;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  Each Brandenberg Concerto is in a different key.  The<br/>problem of key shifts seems negligible.  I am asking &acirc;if&acirc;&#x9D; you<br/>would make a choice for a different tuning or the same tuning for each<br/>of the Brandenbergs, and &acirc;if&acirc;&#x9D; you have an alternative, a SPECIFIC<br/>alternative to WIII.

For common practice (read<br/>5-limit infused, I guess) music, I&apos;m not really a fan of Pythagorean<br/>thirds.

If you believe in key-colour<br/>for Bach, you have to work out how it can make sense to *allow* such<br/>kind of transpositions without ruining the effect.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s the provincial and ethnocentric misconception that is the<br/>&gt; bane of tuning.</p><p>Gosh, fancy words. Meaning what?<br/>For playing Bach, ET happens to be the most common keyboard tuning<br/>used nowadays, which I think is a reasonable definition of<br/>&apos;mainstream&apos;. Of course Bach was terribly provincial and ethnocentric too.</p><p>&gt; There are no 81/64 thirds in historical tunings from the time and<br/>&gt; place of triadic harmony?</p><p>That is not the question. You were saying people *enjoyed* them -<br/>presumably as consonances.

If it was put in ET then<br/>went out of tune, it will have random deviations. But key colour is<br/>about deliberate and systematic deviations.</p><p>If you can tell me which old Russian recordings you had, maybe they&apos;ve<br/>been reissued on CD!</p><p>&gt; &gt;  Rimsky&apos;s comments might not refer to tuning at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Baloney, sense of key color comes from a combination of things<br/>&gt; including tuning.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why that makes what I said &apos;baloney&apos; - unless it were<br/>impossible for anyone to perceive key colours without irregularities<br/>in tuning.

How can we tell if one<br/>person&apos;s experience was due to irregular tuning, or some other source,<br/>or some combination of factors?<br/>(Maybe read Rimsky&apos;s book on orchestration?)</p><p>&gt; orchestras to this day don&apos;t play exactly in<br/>&gt; equal temperament but vary things according to expression and<br/>&gt; function.</p><p>Fine, I never said any orchestras ever played in ET. But this is<br/>irrelevant to the question of key colour. Given that they don&apos;t use<br/>ET, it doesn&apos;t mean that they systematically tuned differently in each<br/>different key. (... maybe they tuned adaptive JI or 1/6 comma meantone<br/>or a host of other things that don&apos;t depend on key ...)</p><p>I don&apos;t see how an orchestra which tunes using its ears would get the<br/>irregularity to make one key deliberately different from another,<br/>unless they were specially instructed beforehand. Why should music in<br/>one major key come out tuned systematically different from another?</p><p>&gt; - no. 10 is a lamentation, and it sounds like a lamentation.</p><p>Sure, the beginning has F minor with meantone G#, the usual funereal<br/>subminor third. But then the music modulates to Eb major and has a<br/>chord on Ab (45 seconds in). This is a complete breakdown in function,<br/>because Ab-Eb here is about 738 cents - but in the score performs the<br/>function of a fifth. Unlike the sharp or flat thirds, I can&apos;t make any<br/>harmonic sense of it myself!</p><p>Whereas, if Eb was made rather lower and G# a bit higher, you could<br/>have the best of both worlds with &apos;interesting&apos; thirds and<br/>recognizable fifths...</p><p>One story about Bach is that he played a meantone organ in Ab major<br/>(that being the &apos;wolf&apos; key) until the organbuilder couldn&apos;t stand it<br/>any longer and had to flee the building. Just the opposite of an<br/>artistic purpose ;&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;  &apos;far&apos; from what? In a circle of fifths, each key is<br/>&gt; related to<br/>&gt; &gt; the other 11 (counting major &amp; minor separately) in the same way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hahaha! Classic piano-player thinking.</p><p>And why would this be inappropriate for a keyboard work including all<br/>24 tonalities?</p><p>&gt; Have you sung Bach chorales? Of course you have.<br/>&gt; The &quot;center&quot; is based on human tessature, which<br/>&gt; you know very well.</p><p>I can&apos;t make any sense out of this. C major and C# major (or Db major)<br/>are right next to each other in tessitura, but miles apart in<br/>character in almost every irregular historical tuning. I just last<br/>night sang the bass part to &apos;Nun ruhen alle Waelde&apos; in Ab major -<br/>although the music said &apos;May also be sung in G&apos;.</p><p>No two people have the same vocal range, plus absolute pitch standards<br/>have changed over a range of several semitones over the last few<br/>hundred years. Then how can any key colour difference between C maj<br/>and C# maj be due to difference of pitch relative to &apos;human&apos; vocal range?</p><p>In Bach&apos;s case, he used at least three different pitches over his<br/>lifetime: one about a semitone above A440, one about a semitone below,<br/>and one a whole tone below. Does this mean that he must have worked<br/>with three different sets of key colours?</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2007 11:52:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;     Some interesting questions for the WTC are:<br/>&gt; &gt;     - Should there be a particular distinction between &apos;sharp&apos; and &apos;flat&apos;<br/>&gt;     keys, or just a distinction between &apos;normal&apos; and &apos;far out&apos;?<br/>&gt;     E.g. Lehman thinks that &apos;flat&apos; keys should be tuned purer than &apos;sharp&apos;<br/>&gt;     keys, other things being equal; Lindley thinks the reverse.<br/>&gt; &gt;     - Which key should be the most &apos;far out&apos; in tuning? Lehman thinks E<br/>&gt;     major/C# minor, Lindley thinks C# major/F minor.</p><p>&apos;Scuse me, but where did I ever say such a thing about C# minor, let alone think it?  This is news to me.</p><p>Or anything about &quot;far out&quot; or exotic or whatever?</p><p>I would also disagree with the assertion: &quot;Lehman thinks that &apos;flat&apos; keys should be tuned purer than &apos;sharp&apos; keys.&quot;  I don&apos;t think that.  I do think that the flat keys and sharp keys make a comparably &quot;pure&quot; *musical effect* when played in compositions by Bach.  Not just thinking it, but hearing it daily as I practice Bach repertoire on my harpsichords.  (Which I tune by ear in about 12 minutes, if anybody cares....)</p><p>N.B. This is not &quot;purity&quot; in the shallow sense of counting up simple-ratio intervals; but rather, the sense that each scale (both melodically and harmonically) makes a crisp, clear, interesting effect with integrity, and no rough spots anywhere.  All 24 keys each present an unproblematic profile, and convincing focus to the music.  In my opinion, of course!  But, I also believe that this is the same type of &quot;purely played&quot; effect CPE Bach was writing about:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cpeb.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/cpeb.html</a></p><p>What I *do* say about C# minor is: in the C# minor fugue of WTC 1, &quot;This fugue (unusually) has real entrances in _six_ different keys, displaying all the following diminished 4ths: B#-E, Fx-B, E#-A, Cx-F#, D#-G and A#-D.  Those are all the six positions in Bach&apos;s temperament where that interval is narrower than or equal to its size in equal temperament.&quot; (May 2005 _Early Music_, top right of page 223)</p><p>I believe that Bach *knew* that they&apos;re the six smallest, simply by listening to them at the keyboard (which merely takes close attention at a decent harpsichord...no calculations!)...and then used this as an unusual compositional feature to help generate this piece of music.
