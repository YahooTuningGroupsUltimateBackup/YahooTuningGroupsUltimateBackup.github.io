Multiplying the generator steps<br/>in 2/25 by two, to make for a direct comparison, I get the following<br/>for 50:</p><p>3    1   4<br/>5    4  16<br/>7   10 -10<br/>11 -13  -2<br/>13  15  10<br/>17 -24   4<br/>19 -22  12</p><p>Here the first column are the primes, the second is meantone<br/>generator steps, and the third is 2/25 generator steps. While it<br/>isn&apos;t a good way to get at the 5-limit, it is an interesting way to<br/>get at the higher prime limits. Here also is 74:</p><p>3    1   4<br/>5    4  16<br/>7   10 -34<br/>11  18  -2<br/>13 -16  10<br/>17 -36   4<br/>19 -34  12</p><p>The 3/37 generator is closer to the corresponding 50 generator then<br/>they are as meantones, the only difference coming at 11. We again<br/>have 11,13,17 and 19 harmonies to play with.</p></div>
