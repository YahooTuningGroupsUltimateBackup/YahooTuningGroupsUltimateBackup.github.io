Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/1999 6:53:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Judith and Paul and everyone.</p><p>Apparently my article on &quot;Chace/caccia, fuga, fugue -- and tuning&quot; has<br/>prompted a bit of discussion, and I&apos;d like to respond to a few points.</p><p>First of all, Judith is very right to point out that Willaert&apos;s<br/>&quot;chromatic duo&quot; of around 1518 or 1519 _does_ represent a<br/>circumnavigation of the circle of fifths during the meantone era,<br/>although keyboard tunings to accommodate such maneuvers apparently did<br/>not become the norm until around the end of the 17th century. Her<br/>example reminds us that sweeping historical generalities such as mine<br/>are indeed only generalities, and also illustrates how composers are<br/>not necessarily limited in their imagination and realization by the<br/>prevalent tuning paradigms of a given time.</p><p>To her account, I might add one story that Willaert may have written<br/>this piece in part as a kind of artistic retaliation against the Papal<br/>choir for having the less than flattering taste to perform a certain<br/>motet of his regularly -- until they learned that it was indeed by<br/>him, not by Josquin as they had assumed.</p><p>As Paul points out, a Renaissance meantone tuning would seem most<br/>unlikely for this vocal piece, which some modern commentators have<br/>suggested could be a kind of theoretical as well as practical<br/>demonstration of 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet). To say that<br/>_most_ 16th-century vocal as well as keyboard music comfortably fits<br/>within the range of a 12-note meantone temperament is not to deny this<br/>and other important exceptions.</p><p>Curiously, the quasi-Pythagorean temperament of Henricus Grammateus<br/>(1518), where he indulged in an &quot;amusing reckoning&quot; by showing a<br/>geometric method for measuring organ pipes to divided the Pythagorean<br/>9:8 whole-tone into two equal semitones (~101.95 cents each), might<br/>have permitted a marginally tolerable rendition of Willaert&apos;s<br/>chromatic duo (possibly lending itself to a quartet realization also)<br/>on a 12-note keyboard. In this tuning the diatonic notes are is in a<br/>pure Pythagorean tuning, with 9:8 whole-tones and 256:243 semitones<br/>(e.g. e-f, b-c&apos;); accidentals split tones into equal semitones. This<br/>tuning includes &quot;semi-Wolf&quot; fifths, but avoids outright Wolves; its<br/>Pythagorean thirds and sixths might be less than ideal for Renaissance<br/>music of this era, however.</p><p>It may be something of a moot question to what extent lutes were tuned<br/>in 12-tet by the epoch around 1520, although by 1550 or so this tuning<br/>was well-documented as the norm. Certainly Willaert&apos;s duo could be<br/>played on such an instrument. Although the exigencies of playing<br/>polyphonic music on a lute, where unequal semitones on different frets<br/>could much complicate the performer&apos;s task, seem to have been a major<br/>motive for tuning with equal semitones, as early as 1567 a collection<br/>of pieces by Giacomo Gorzanis using all 12 notes of the chromatic<br/>scale as finals signals that composers were well aware of the<br/>enharmonic equivalences of this tuning and ready to exploit<br/>them. However, I&apos;m not aware if any piece in this collection<br/>&quot;circumnavigates&quot; the circle of fifths, although one might say that<br/>the collection as a whole represents a kindred kind of exploration.</p><p>In 1555, Nicola Vicentino published his description of the<br/>_archicembalo_, based essentially on 31-tet (which Vicentino<br/>apparently recognized was virtually identical to 1/4-comma meantone,<br/>although he does not attempt to demonstrate this equivalence<br/>mathematically). While he certainly explored the diatonic, chromatic,<br/>and enharmonic styles of music made possible by this instrument<br/>(urging singers to emulate it in order to learn the novel intervals<br/>involved), I&apos;m not aware of his circumnavigating this system in a<br/>piece.</p><p>Around 1570, as Paul mentions, Guillaume Costeley proposed 19-tet, and<br/>his chromatic spiritual chanson _Seigneur Dieu ta pitie/_ is open to<br/>more than one interpretation for some of the accidentals. For<br/>alternative transcriptions of this piece, and also the text and<br/>translation from a preface by Costeley very clearly describing a<br/>19-note keyboard dividing each whole-tone into three parts, see<br/>Kenneth J. Levy, &quot;Costeley&apos;s Chromatic Chanson,&quot; _Annales<br/>Musicologues: Moyen-Age et Renaissance_, Tome III (1955),<br/>pp. 213-261. Interestingly enough, Costeley describes the instrument<br/>as having eight white keys, the usual five black keys, and seven extra<br/>black keys per octave -- evidently counting the white keys at both<br/>ends of an octave, to get 20 keys in all rather than 19.</p><p>Levy notes that one solution of the accidentals in fact results in a<br/>&quot;drop solution&quot; where &quot;the piece describes a complete circle through<br/>musical space, ending as it began in the Dorian key of g.&quot; However, he<br/>argues that a different solution based on absolute piece is preferable<br/>in terms of the musical style and textual expression (ibid. 232-240).</p><p>Aside from presenting a fascinating discussion of Costeley&apos;s 19-tet in<br/>theory and practice, Levy also discusses some trends in 16th-century<br/>chromaticism, mentioning the Willaert piece as one example.</p><p>Incidentally, while advocacy of 12-tet for keyboards as opposed to<br/>fretted instruments was evidently unusual in the 16th century, Zarlino<br/>(1588) does quote a treatise by a certain Abbot Girolamo Roselli who<br/>advocates this tuning as a &quot;spherical music&quot; where composers are free<br/>to transpose the gamut however they desire, and where singers and<br/>performers on assorted instruments can have the pleasure of being<br/>mutually in tune. Thus I would like to credit Roselli as a source for<br/>my &quot;circumnavigation&quot; metaphor.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
