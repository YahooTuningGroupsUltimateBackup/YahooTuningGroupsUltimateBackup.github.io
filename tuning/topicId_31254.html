CNMI has been established by<br/>Lewis Jones and Patrick Ozzard-Low, and has recently appointed Donald<br/>Bousted as Leverhulme composer in residence. The aim of CNMI is to<br/>develop new versions of mainstream acoustic instruments, with the<br/>immediate objective of creating orchestral-type instruments which<br/>reliably provide quartertones and other tuning systems. CNMI is also<br/>keen to encourage new timbral possibilities, acoustic-electronic hybrid<br/>instruments, and those which complement digital and electroacoustic<br/>instruments and music.</p><p>The application of new technologies to existing instruments suggests<br/>many new design possibilities.  For example, CNMI is prototyping wind<br/>instruments in which keys and valves are activated electromechanically.<br/>A brass quintet is being remodelled by David Cowie to employ solenoid<br/>valve action, in which each instrument will provide for 12, 19, and<br/>24-division equal-temperaments; a quartertone flute is also being made -<br/>in collaboration with the manufacturer Trevor J. James &amp; Co.</p><p>The purpose of the symposium is to encourage composers, performers and<br/>instrument makers to become involved in the development of new<br/>instruments through the CNMI project.</p><p>CNMI also invites composers to submit scores for a new microtonal<br/>trumpet (solo or with percussion and/or tape).  Selected pieces will be<br/>given a workshop performance by Duo Contour - Stephen Altoft (trumpet)<br/>and Lee Ferguson (percussion) - as part of the LGU Department of Design<br/>and Technology Summer Show.  The workshop will be open to the public and<br/>will be one of a number of new music events on Friday 28 June 2002.</p><p>The deadline for receipt of scores is Friday 29 March 2002.</p><p>There are four categories of submission:<br/>1) solo trumpet<br/>2) trumpet and percussion<br/>3) trumpet and tape<br/>4) trumpet, percussion and tape</p><p>Tape format should be CD or DAT only.  Live electronics are not<br/>available.  Percussion should be restricted to non-pitched instruments:<br/>large set-ups cannot be accommodated.  If you have particular<br/>requirements please check availability in advance with Lewis Jones<br/>(contact details below).</p><p>The maximum duration is 3 minutes.</p><p>CNMI also seeks to create related opportunities for performers,<br/>instrument makers, acousticians and musicologists.  CNMI projects have<br/>been generously supported in 2001 by the Performing Rights Society<br/>Foundation, Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Trevor J. James &amp; Co, and Paxman Ltd.</p><p>Location: London Guildhall University (Room 100), 41 Commercial Road,<br/>London E1 1LA.  Nearest tube: Aldgate East.<br/>Coffee and registration: 10.00 am.
