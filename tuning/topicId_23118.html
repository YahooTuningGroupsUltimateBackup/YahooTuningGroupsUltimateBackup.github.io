For example, as I recall, the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series of between seventy and eighty episodes did this in only two programs:  jangling bells as part of Spock&apos;s marriage ceremony on Vulcan and a sort of lyre or harp used in &quot;Searching for Eden&quot;.<br/>I have just run across an interesting description which I find so beautifully written I&apos;d like to share it with you.  Perhaps it may even inspire a composition.  It is in the paperback book, &quot;Star Winds&quot; by Barrington J. Bayley, Daw Books, Inc., Donald A. Wollheim, publisher, copyright 1978 by the author, pages 122 - 123:</p><p>          A tinkling sound reached Rachad&apos;s ears as he encountered the first<br/>     coils of the sparkling smoke.  Stepping down the staircase was like<br/>     floating through a cloud.  The tones, initially random and inchoate,<br/>     increased in volume and texture, coalescing as he moved into a collage<br/>     of shifting, novel melodies of incredible complexity and color.<br/>          The duke&apos;s voice drifted to him.  &quot;Does the melody mist please you?<br/>     The smoke is composed of crystal particles, each emitting a tiny tone.  In<br/>     addition the crystals have a vibrational empathy with one another; they<br/>     respond to each other, creating elaborate webs of sound that movement<br/>     translates into tunes and harmonies.  No composer could equal the<br/>     inventiveness of the mist . . . music, I find, is a unique adjunct to the<br/>     stirrings of the soul. . . . My Aegis is everywhere pervaded by music. . . .<br/>     One could become lost in music. . . .&quot;<br/>          The murmuring voice went on, droning against the ever-meshing,<br/>     ever-separating and commingling maze pf melody, which was beginning<br/>     to lull Rachad into a state of helpless fascination, especially as the<br/>     melodies were so alien to his ear.  But then they reached the bottom of<br/>     the steps and, a little farther on, emerged into clearer air.<br/>          . . .<br/>          They strolled across a mosaic floor strewn with what looked like rose<br/>     petals.  The music had faded to a tinkle, like the sound of a running<br/>     stream in the background.</p><p>It reminds me a bit of computer generated composition.  But this book, being a space opera, complete with faster than light ships sailing on the solar wind, pistols, swords and horses, has no computers.</p></div><h3><a id=23128 href="#23128">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@unicode.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2001 11:41:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John F.

If you can ever find it (now out of print for<br/>some years) my fantasy novel &quot;A Harlot of Venus&quot; has a long passage<br/>describing a mystical erotic ceremony with lavish music as well as a<br/>flamboyant character who plays the keyboard in a forest.  I won&apos;t post it<br/>here... If anyone ever finds a copy, I&apos;d be glad to autograph it... ;-)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
