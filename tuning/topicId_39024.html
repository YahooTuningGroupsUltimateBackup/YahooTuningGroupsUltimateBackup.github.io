It seems that his system works both musically, and physically.<br/>2. The method which he used, derived from pi,  to select intervals for melody, and harmony, are a &quot;better&quot; paradigm than integer frequency ratios for mapping musical intervals.<br/>3.

(e.g. no direct connection between duration and stave length, need for key signature indication, etc. etc.)</p><p>The best recent alternative notation system that I have seen was designed by Bill and Anne Collins, and uses closer lines on the stave for the &quot;small&quot; intervals (E to F) and (B to C).</p><p>Some people enjoy chasing shadows.</p><p>Have fun!</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a> (LucyScaleDevelopments)<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a><br/>for Lucytuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/> or <a href="http://www.lucytune.co.uk">http://www.lucytune.co.uk</a>  or <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2002 8:56:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mr. Lucy,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; As I understand it Lou Harrison and many other integer frequency<br/>&gt;&gt; ratio advocates, have yet to be able to hear or tune beyond<br/>&gt;&gt; commas...</p><p>You attempted to explain away this comment with the following:</p><p>&gt; I mean what I said.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;hear or tune beyond  commas.&quot; suggests that those who refuse to<br/>&gt; consider any intervals other that whole number ratios, are<br/>&gt; artificially restricting the possibilities.</p><p>That is not what your first statement indicates in plain English. &quot;Have yet to be able to hear...&quot; most definitely posits that it is an incapability, and not a decision (as you frame it) to hear or utilize pitches/harmonies outside of integer ratios. Choosing to restrict one&apos;s compositional materials is a valid choice - you prefer LucyTuning (Universal Trademarks apply), some prefer 72EDO (and feel it &apos;near just enough for just&apos;), and others utilize integer ratios (JI and other similar systems). None of these choices are, by any reasonable standard, a *bad* choice.</p><p>You cannot, of course, offer any material to support such a claim for someone like Lou Harrison (i.e. that he uses the materials he does because he cannot hear anything beyond those materials). That people don&apos;t choose to follow a path that you do, and that you propose, is one thing; to suggest that they somehow lack the understanding, capability, or acumen to do so is more than a bit silly.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2002 4:36:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 1.

The<br/>Lucy fifth of 600+300/pi cents is indistinguishable in practice from<br/>3/10-comma meantone (one one hundredth of a cent difference.) Lucy tuning on 19 tones would give a wolf less than 21 cents flat, by the way.</p></div>
