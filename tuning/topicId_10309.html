He had an acute ear.<br/>After I&apos;d played the piece for him, he sang that part of<br/>the melody which had the slightly flattened high note,<br/>finding it unsatisfactorily flat.  Before he pointed that<br/>out to me, I hadn&apos;t been conscious of that place in the<br/>piece sounding particularly out of tune.  Of course there<br/>were temperings in the music, but I thought (and still do)<br/>that the piece in MT compared very favorably with the<br/>EQT version.  Once he pointed it out to me, however, I<br/>found it impossible not to be aware of that place in the<br/>music whenever I heard it again, and I would always<br/>notice the slightly unsatisfactory flatness of that<br/>high note.  Why did he have to point that out to me!?</p><p>Dave Hill   La Mesa, CA</p></div>
