If<br/>&gt; beat per second is a tool for identifying ratio as just what is its<br/>&gt; limitation around zero even if the numbers are large?<br/>&gt;</p><p>   If you are tuning by eliminating audible low freq beating, then you<br/>are most likely approaching an interval within say the 9 or 11 limit,<br/>or whatever your talented ear can hear, for instance, tuning just 3:2<br/>on the piano.   If your JI scale includes 964:771, then its your call.<br/> If your scale includes irrational roots, or ratios designed to<br/>impersonate irrationality, then calling it Just is out of the<br/>question, IMHO.<br/>  Beat per second is frequency dependent.  Small whole number ratios<br/>are related to harmonic series, but scales do not necessarily derive<br/>from either pure harmonics nor overtone series.<br/>  When you say the limitation around zero, I guess you mean how close<br/>to just do your unisons or 3:2 have to get to just?  On a piano, some<br/>notes or ranges you want to zero out to 1/10 bps, some you are pleased<br/>to leave at 1/2 bps.  Especially if just one unfortunate string has a<br/>beating overtone, you will need to &quot;feather&quot; in beats surrounding that<br/>tone.</p></div><h3><a id=60678 href="#60678">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2005 12:55:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Richard Eldon Barber&quot;<br/>&lt;bassooner42@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mohajeri Shahin&quot; &lt;shahinm@k...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks friends.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But Richard , what do you mean by small ? if we choose<br/>denominator as<br/>&gt; &gt; 8,10 , 11 , 15 , the ratio is just?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; May be it relates to harmonic numbers in two sound of ratio ? may<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; relate to beat number ? the ratio like 964:771 is non-just or<br/>&gt; &gt; pseudo-just or even just (as carl said n*d=743244&gt;100 so not<br/>just)?
