I love the melodic resources it provides.  I am  aware<br/>that Rudolph Rasch does not like this interval, but it has not influenced  me.  I<br/>am also aware that the 81/64 has a history of more than a thousand  years<br/>preceding the Renaissance.</p><p>When I play Bach&apos;s music in Werckmeister III, I hear things in the music<br/>that others often do not hear, things that bring me great enjoyment.  To  many,<br/>any unequal Bach is the same, since it is opposed to ET, which is the<br/>predominant tuning used for Bach for a hundred years (at least).</p><p>When I hear the Ives Universe Symphony, I hear the intonation of extended<br/>Pythagorean tuning, while some others hear morass.</p><p>When I hear the word meantone, it is a family of like temperaments.   (Sorry<br/>George, but 7-note Pythagorean is not a temperament and so, could not be<br/>considered meantone.)  If only quarter comma meantone was _the_ legitimate<br/>meantone, there would be no need for a fraction preceding it.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3>Aaron K.

One can have a<br/> special relationship with a pet rock.  They should not be dismissed.   They<br/>are real feelings.  I have attached a gestalt sentiment for a  particular well<br/>temperament.  Being confused in a listening test is  wonderful tomfoolery.<br/>It would be different if you had changed the  Chromatic Fantasy tuning into<br/>something other than ET or WIII.  This I  would notice.  Although I don&apos;t know if<br/>many others would.</p><p>Johnny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div>
