In order to engage the LSB of the pitch bend message it says I must use a decimal argument.  So normally I send it the message &quot;bend pbv ch&quot; where pbv is the pitch bend value and ch is the channel.  So, as usual, with the MSB the value ranges from +/- 64 with 64 being no change.  With the decimal added it can take values such as 64.09.  My question is this: what is the conversion operation I would need to translate this kinky decimal arrangement to a cents value and visa versa?  Would it involve converting base 2 to base 10?  I am at a loss.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Jeremy Hunt</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2005 11:42:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jeremy Hunt &lt;jrmy@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Responded to on tuning-math.</p></div>
