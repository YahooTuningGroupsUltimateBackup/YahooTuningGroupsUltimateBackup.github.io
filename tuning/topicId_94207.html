In this model, rather than<br/>assuming the incoming dyad has a logarithmic (in cents) Gaussian<br/>probability mistuning curve around it and that the basis dyads have<br/>rectangular-shaped &quot;domains&quot; around them, I assume that the incoming<br/>dyad has no mistuning curve, but that every dyad has a Gaussian-shaped<br/>&quot;field of attraction&quot; around it. So by</p><p>- assigning each dyad a complexity (let&apos;s say n*d for now), and hence<br/>a &quot;simplicity&quot; of 1/n*d<br/>- and then plotting a Gaussian centered around that dyad<br/>- and giving it a height equal to 1 over the aforementioned complexity<br/>- and a standard deviation equivalent to Paul&apos;s &quot;s&quot; parameter<br/>- and then adding all of the Gaussians together to get some resultant<br/>curve (or creating a bunch of impulses and convolving it with a<br/>Gaussian to compute everything in nlogn time)</p><p>the following &quot;consonance curve&quot; is produced (I used s=1% and a Tenney<br/>series where n*d&lt;=10000 for this example). All of these are on loglog<br/>plots, where the y axis is log as well to make the nuances in the<br/>curve easier to see:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/DistributedComplexityModeling/dc_log_consonance_s_1.png">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/DistributedComplexityModeling/dc_log_consonance_s_1.png</a></p><p>Taking 1/(this curve) gives the corresponding &quot;dissonance curve,&quot;<br/>which will probably look really familiar:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/DistributedComplexityModeling/dc_log_dissonance_s_1.png">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/DistributedComplexityModeling/dc_log_dissonance_s_1.png</a></p><p>The similarities between this and HE were really surprising at first.<br/>This is probably mathematically really close or the same as the actual<br/>HE calculation &quot;under the hood,&quot; but I don&apos;t care enough to figure it<br/>out anymore.

If one has the series 8 -13-21 and one moves the top number down to 8-10.5-13 one can see that this triad will have the same difference tones in octaves and if one is using this series as a scale will also be a scale member hence reinforcing other notes one is going to hear.<br/> This is not my favorite here . but things like the 32-37-42 is one i use allot and even the  43-50-57 works in a &apos;6-7-8&apos; sense within my meta-slendro.<br/> Actually my biggest problem with this scale is that the most dissonant thing i can do, playing all 12 tones of my series does not sound that dissonant at all. This makes it hard for me to explain it as simply  an appox. to JI vicinity, although i think you are on the right track.<br/> If i were to pursuit the problem ( which i am not ) i would assume two ways of having consonance both with share the property of producing acoustical coincidence.

That&apos;s 226 versus 34!</p><p>It comes out of an idea that I had a long time ago: that the array of<br/>combination-sensitive neurons in the brain might effectively form some<br/>kind of filterbank, or set of &quot;harmonic sieves,&quot; or however you&apos;d like<br/>to think of it, for all of the frequencies across the hearing<br/>spectrum.</p><p>Carl suggested that the ideal spectral rolloff for the most<br/>&quot;concordant&quot; sound is 1/N^2, since that&apos;s the approximate spectrum of<br/>the human voice. So it makes sense that the filters in the brain would<br/>be tuned to something similar (or in actuality, tuned to the inverse<br/>of this, so that the crosscorrelation of the filter and the signal<br/>would be highest if the signal has a rolloff of 1/N^2).</p><p>So if that were the case, then any dyad n/d would contribute 1/n^2 +<br/>1/d^2 energy to that filter, which is n^2d^2/n^2+d^2. This is close to<br/>0.5*(n*d) if n-d is small (superparticular), and as n-d gets larger it<br/>diverges.</p><p>But I screwed up in my initial message to you: 1/n^2 + 1/d^2 is more<br/>like an analogue of &quot;simplicity&quot; in that 1/1 gives the highest result,<br/>and 2/1 gives the next-highest result, and so on. So this would mean<br/>that 15/1 ends up being less &quot;complex&quot; than 5/3. Why? Because what<br/>this is really trying to model, my perhaps ill-advised choice of the<br/>word &quot;complexity&quot; aside, is how strong the volume of the VF produced<br/>will be, or how &quot;clear&quot; it will be. For 15/1, the 1 is being played<br/>right there, so there&apos;s no estimation that needs to take place. For<br/>5/3, the volume of the VF will be less clear than 15/1.</p><p>The question is, then, whether or not 15/1 will really be heard as a<br/>complex 1 with only a 15th harmonic, or whether the 15 will be heard<br/>as a flattened 2, or perhaps whether it&apos;ll be heard as inharmonic.<br/>This is where the Gaussian spreading comes into play, which will<br/>reveal whether or not 15 gets its own consonance maximum or not.</p><p>It&apos;s a new toy to play around with, and I&apos;m still exploring the<br/>implications of it. Perhaps complexity is a bad term for it, since<br/>that already refers to something else.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 3:47:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Nov 5, 2010 at 6:44 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if that were the case, then any dyad n/d would contribute 1/n^2 +<br/>&gt; 1/d^2 energy to that filter, which is n^2d^2/n^2+d^2.

So what<br/>this model is conceptually equivalent to saying, then, is:</p><p>There has been a lot of speculation that some process in the brain is<br/>performing something similar to an autocorrelation on the incoming<br/>signal to find periodicity information. This approach diverges from<br/>that by postulating that the brain is performing a huge set of<br/>cross-correlations for every possible fundamental frequency, and<br/>whichever ones match the signal end up &quot;lighting up&quot; that part of the<br/>brain.</p><p>If the brain is, instead, performing some kind of autocorrelation on<br/>the signal, and this model is actually TOO robust for what the brain<br/>is doing, then there will be several &quot;auditory illusions&quot; that exist<br/>that this model doesn&apos;t predict.</p><p>This is I think related to the question of whether or not these<br/>neuronal &quot;filters&quot; reflect individual parallel pitch processors<br/>(PPPs), or if there still exists a Goldstein-esque central pitch<br/>processor (CPP), and these get &quot;activated&quot; based on what the CPP<br/>decides. So either these are individual filters, or they reflect some<br/>kind of &quot;memory&quot; in the brain where the CPP would store the results of<br/>its analysis.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2010 9:44:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Nov 18, 2010 at 3:06 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would certainly go a ways in explaining why sawtooth waves<br/>&gt; are not really concordant. -Carl</p><p>In what sense do you not hear them as concordant?

You can think of it<br/>also as jitter, or as an artifact of the fact that the sawtooth can<br/>never &quot;jump&quot; back down between samples, so to make it jump back at the<br/>next nearest sample introduces a rounding error into the mix. The<br/>spectrum ends up looking like this:</p><p><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/307/week5/img12.gif">http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/307/week5/img12.gif</a></p><p>This is a more extreme example than we&apos;re used to, but the best I<br/>could find.

In general, for most sounds,<br/>you can pick out the individual harmonics. So perhaps a good way to<br/>define the &quot;most concordant&quot; sound is to define it as one in which the<br/>sound is so fused that you can&apos;t pick out those individual harmonics<br/>anymore (i.e. the rolloff is less than 1/N), but the fundamental is<br/>still &quot;clearer&quot; than that of a sine wave, in which you also can&apos;t pick<br/>out individual harmonics because there are none.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2010 3:49:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think my Nord Lead 2 had this problem, but basically: in<br/>&gt; the digital realm, if you just &quot;draw&quot; a sawtooth wave in the<br/>&gt; time domain, all of the harmonics above the Nyquist frequency</p><p>Yes, I understand aliasing.
