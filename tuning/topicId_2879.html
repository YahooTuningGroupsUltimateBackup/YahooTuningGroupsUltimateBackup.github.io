(Gil Miranda, now at Oberlin,<br/>would be an excellent choice).</p><p>If you intended to make some connection between Bach and Beethoven and<br/>later popular musics, I can&apos;t follow you at all. The oft-claimed unity<br/>between art and popular musics in earlier times just does not hold up with<br/>the historical record, especially since what we now call &apos;the public&apos; is a<br/>very modern development. In his lifetime, Bach was a local musician whose<br/>activities were known very little outside of Thuringia and Saxony and whose<br/>compositional style, while professionally respected and an achievement of<br/>unmatched depth and complexity, was well behind the more popular stylistic<br/>trends _within the professional art music genres_. Beethoven is the eminent<br/>model of the commercially succesful professional composer, but one whose<br/>work was really produced for an elite audience and for whom popular and<br/>folk generas do indeed form compositional _topoi_, but only as stylistic<br/>citations within the structure of a composed work. Beethoven was clearly<br/>familar with folk and popular musics of his day, but his compositional<br/>activity continuously sets himself outside these genres.</p></div>
