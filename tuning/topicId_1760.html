Which is a contradiction, with<br/>octave equivalency...</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;If you make 5/4 simpler than 6/5, then you&apos;re making 8/5 simpler than<br/>&gt;5/3. Can you swallow that?  Not me!</p><p>...as Erlich points out.</p><p>[Hahn]<br/>&gt;If I were to get picky about it, the reverse would probably be<br/>true--leaving &gt;in factors of 2 and going to whole-number-limit (instead of<br/>odd-limit), 6 is &gt;closer to 5 than 8, and that&apos;s how I&apos;d rank them aurally.</p><p>If you mean 6/5, 5/4, and 8/5, this works for me.  The n+d weighting puts<br/>6/5 in the middle of 5/4 and 8/5.  I&apos;m not getting a feeling for which<br/>(middle, or closer to 5/4) is more accurate.</p><p>I have a problem with limit weightings in general.  Both odd and integer<br/>limit give the 9/4 and 9/7 equal consonance, for example.  For this reason,<br/>I prefer the something like n+d.</p><p>n+d itself gets off the boat around the 9-limit, unfortunately.  So<br/>howabout log(n*d)?  I tried it for 126/125...</p><p>lg(126*125) = 13.9430642  [just the fraction]</p><p>lg(2) + 2lg(3) + 3lg(5) + lg(7) = 13.943063  [prime factors 126*125]</p><p>2log(30) + log(35) = 14.9430642  [shortest lattice route 6/5, 6/5, 7/5]</p><p>...they&apos;re all the same (I used base2 logs).  Can anybody tell if this<br/>solves the problem concerning Paul Hahn&apos;s original algorithm?  Of course,<br/>you&apos;d expect lg(n*d) and and the sum of the logs of the absolute values of<br/>the prime factors to be the same.  But if it&apos;s always the same as the<br/>quickest lattice route, it makes calculating this metric rather easy.</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;If you can&apos;t swallow octave-equivalent formulations at all, you&apos;re missing<br/>&gt;out on something very useful, since it is often assumed that all<br/>octave-&gt;equivalents of all scale tones will be used...</p><p>Why not just throw a 2-axis on the lattice and weight by log prime/odd<br/>limit as before?</p><p>[Hahn]<br/>&gt;Hmm--Carl, can you swallow 5/4 = 5/3?</p><p>I think so.  In fact, I can also accept the n+d weighting, giving the 5/3<br/>as slightly more consonant.</p></div><h3><a id=1774 href="#1774">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
