Rather, it was a request<br/>for a direct 18th century reference that would back up any direct<br/>connection between Werckmeister&apos;s books and Bach.  Such a thing, if it<br/>exists, should be found within the covers of the several volumes of<br/>_Bach-Dokumente_ from the NBA, should it not?  Conveniently numbered<br/>among the 600+ other items in those books?</p><p>It just doesn&apos;t do to assert things like this: &quot;Many have since<br/>commented that Werckmeister&apos;s Orgel-Probe was a mainstay in Johann<br/>Sebastian Bach&apos;s personal library.  When Johann Sebastian was a child,<br/>his extended family was devouring Werckmeister&apos;s Orgel-Probe which<br/>effectively announced the new era of chromatic organ playing with its<br/>introduction.&quot;  The request was for a definite and unequivocal 18th<br/>century source, not the vague opinion of &quot;many&quot; (many what? AFMM<br/>concert-goers?) about the contents of JSB&apos;s personal library in his<br/>youth or midlife.</p><p>Heck, I don&apos;t even know what my own father had in his personal library<br/>when he was 18 to 30.  I don&apos;t see how anyone can be sure about<br/>&quot;mainstay&quot; volumes in Bach&apos;s, either, 300 years ago.  No copies of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s books are in the explicit list of books in Bach&apos;s<br/>estate.  Did Albert Schweitzer really write such things as you implied<br/>with your first paragraph?  What were *his* sources?</p><p>Thanks anyway,<br/>Brad Lehman</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So sorry, my book is continues to belie an easy transition to Yahoo.<br/>  Sorry<br/>&gt; it is hard to read (if not decipher).
