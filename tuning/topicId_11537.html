I also find that his style of answering each<br/>topic with a separate e-mail message is a VERY good way of handling<br/>ideas in e-mail.  I do it with ALL my OTHER non-list e-mail as well...</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t &quot;Web-based&quot; e-mail be a possible way of reducing expenses??<br/>There would, of course, be the Internet charge... but I don&apos;t believe<br/>there would be a &quot;byte&quot; charge.  I&apos;m thinking, of course, of Web-based<br/>e-mail services like those provided by Yahoo or Netscape.  Am I<br/>correct??</p><p>__________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
