It&apos;s a refreshing change from the rank 2 temperaments that I&apos;ve been working with -- intervals are always the same size as in ETs, but the lack of octaves constrains the way the harmony progresses. I haven&apos;t figured out how to notate them yet, but the regularity of the tuning makes it possible to use the piano roll without difficulty.</p><p>The third example, in the Carlos Gamma scale, starts with a uniquely microtonal harmonic progression, alternating between major 7th and minor 7th chords, in a kind of interlocked way (with the roots one step apart). This is the sort of thing that&apos;s possible in scales like Gamma or 31-ET, but not in 12-ET.</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2008 4:27:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote:</p><p>&gt; As the subject of Wendy Carlos&apos; non-octave Alpha, Beta, and Gamma scales<br/>&gt; has come up on the MMM list, I decided to get my feet wet and try a<br/>&gt; little exploration with them.</p><p> Nice music -- pleasant to my ear.</p><p>But I can hear octaves there as well.

If you temper an octave by 256/257 and divide it 34-equal you<br/>get the same tuning, within some miniscule amount. It is an excellent<br/>tuning in my opinion.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2008 2:10:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Par&iuml;&iquest;&half;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Herman wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;&gt;  As the subject of Wendy Carlos&apos; non-octave Alpha, Beta, and Gamma scales<br/>&gt;&gt;  has come up on the MMM list, I decided to get my feet wet and try a<br/>&gt;&gt;  little exploration with them.<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  Nice music -- pleasant to my ear.<br/>&gt; &gt; But I can hear octaves there as well.
