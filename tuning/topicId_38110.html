It was known as an &quot;ELECTRIC<br/>THEREMIN-ORGAN,&quot; which was an electronic organ with microtuning.</p><p>The instrument was designed by Joseph Schillinger, built by Leon<br/>Theremin (the inventor of the &quot;theremin&quot;) and financed by Gerald<br/>Warburg in 1932. The instrument had the following specifications:</p><p>1.  75 keys<br/>2.  75 tuning dials<br/>3.  The tuning dials permited each key to tune within the range of<br/>    1/3 of a tone of the 12 step equal temperament.<br/>4.  Electrical power output of 9 watts.<br/>5.  Vibrato by intensity with speed control.<br/>6.  Sound intensity controlled by a pedal.<br/>7.  Timbre control by a pedal.<br/>8.  Special keyboard.<br/>9.  A loudspeaker was enclosed within the organ facing the right side.<br/>10. Range from 256 - 1024.</p><p>The instrument looked like an organ, and was built to test<br/>Schillinger&apos;s system of tuning called &quot;Double Equal Temperament.&quot;  It<br/>was last seen 30 years ago.</p><p>If the organ was donated to an institution or archive, it was given<br/>by Mrs. Gerald Warburg.</p><p>If you have any information concerning this instrument or know of<br/>someone who might have, please contact me at <a href="mailto:Lpine@ia.net">Lpine@ia.net</a></p><p>Thank you.<br/>L.
