This is the song<br/>&gt; used in that car commercial (BMW?) and I think AT&amp;T used to use<br/>&gt; it, or was it American Express.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In anycase I find it starting on 27/20, a slightly sharp fourth<br/>&gt; (+17&#xFFFD; in 72ET) or Sruti #10 for Danielou.  It&apos;s been playing in<br/>&gt; my brain nonstop ever since.<br/>------------<br/>I agree that this is an unforgettable song.  I&apos;ve known it<br/>long before it was released on this album because it was on<br/>a record of Bulgarian folk music I found in the library once.</p><p>But I found it to be by far the least microtonal of all the songs<br/>on the &quot;Mystere&quot; album.  For the many of you out there who probably<br/>own this popular disk, Check out track #9 (I forget the name<br/>of it, it&apos;s Bulgarian in any case).  Man, how did they learn to<br/>*sing* those harmonies??!!</p><p>Most of the songs done by this group are modern composed pieces,<br/>based mainly on the Bulgarian folk idiom, and some, like #9,<br/>with a bit of jazz flavor.  But even in back-woods<br/>Bulgarian village folk-music, you can find lots of microtones,<br/>and also the most stimulating and interesting meters I&apos;ve ever<br/>found in folk music.</p><p>-monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>--------------------<br/>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
