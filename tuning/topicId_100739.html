Since some members of the list want to have it right now, I decided to postpone the paper and send you the following:</p><p>-- The true octave (given in decimals, 11 decimal digits)</p><p>-- A 12 Tone scale that I named MPER12ET-- (C = 1, 2C = The true octave)</p><p>-- 12 Equal fifths</p><p>-- 12 Equal major fifths</p><p>All the above can be sent in a message.</p><p>Since I cannot send attachments to tuning, I can address to Mike&acute;s personal email an attached table containing the 88 keyboard frequencies in decimals, cents, Hz, A = 440.</p><p>I can do the above once Mike approves by email this operation.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario<br/>Lima, July 12, 2011</p></div>
