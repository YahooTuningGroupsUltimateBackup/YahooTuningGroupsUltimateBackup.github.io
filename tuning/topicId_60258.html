The brat is the only one not simple,<br/>177/176, though perhaps that is good enough as an approximate 1 to help.<br/>The rest of it is pretty normal, but with nice brats; aside from the 3/2<br/>(pure fifths) and 2 brats Wendel used, it has brats of 4. This is also<br/>a useful number, with the associated beat ratios going 4, -1, -1/4, so<br/>that we have only integers and inverse integers (which amounts to the<br/>same thing.)</p><p>! brac.scl<br/>circulating temperament with simple beat ratios<br/>! beat ratios 4 3/2 4 3/2 2 2 177/176 4 3/2 2 3/2 2<br/>12<br/>!<br/>56640/53701<br/>60008/53701<br/>63720/53701<br/>67264/53701<br/>71685/53701<br/>75056/53701<br/>80276/53701<br/>84960/53701<br/>89920/53701<br/>95580/53701<br/>100544/53701<br/>2</p></div>
