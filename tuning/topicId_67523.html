His enthusiasm for the project continued with a chisel on<br/>a chunk of tree root for some time afterward. Playing the guitar, I<br/>was thinking about the instrument building and fretting I did some<br/>years ago, with Paul Erlich&acute;s paper on 22-EDO lying on the table by<br/>coincidence, leafed over to the part where he compares 22-EDO with<br/>the Indian sruti system.</p><p>What follows sprang into my head full-blown; it took longer to hunt<br/>down the measuring tape than it did to verify the first intervals.</p><p>My assumptions are:</p><p>-The origins of tuning are inseperable from physical and practical<br/>considerations.</p><p>-Accuracy and consistency can be achieved with math, tools, and<br/>materials which were available to the ancients.</p><p>-Fundamental ideas about the origins of the sruti system, as well-<br/>known in different theories, are all correct, even when they<br/>contradict each other. So much music for so long in such a huge and<br/>wildly diverse area, with so much fundamental unity and integrity...<br/>there is simply no way the deepest roots could be in conflict.</p><p>-The sruti are equal... and unequal.</p><p>-Anytime you use a ruler when fretting, you&acute;re using equal-divisions-<br/>of-length.</p><p>-THE LENGTH OF A STRING CHANGES EVERY TIME YOU FRET IT.</p><p>Here is a chart resulting from a simple and palpable way of finding<br/>and fretting specific intervals, using simple math<br/>and 22 &quot;sruti&quot;, with intervals found at 4, 3, or 2 &quot;sruti&quot;.</p><p>The first column gives a kind of &quot;sruti number&quot;, the second the<br/>physical size of the &quot;sruti&quot; in millimeters, the third, ideal fret<br/>positions for intervals given. The measurements in the &quot;Fret&quot; column<br/>apply to an open string length of 646 mm (measured from my acoustic<br/>guitar), with fret, nut, and bridge height set to the default string<br/>length calculations in Scala.</p><p>0      0 Nut     Nut-Fret mm         Frets</p><p>1      14.68    14.68     mm<br/>2      29.36    29.36<br/>3      44.04    44.04<br/>4      58.72    58.72     mm         10/9 is    63.817 mm</p><p>1      12.0123<br/>2      24.024<br/>3      36.0369<br/>4      48.0495   106.769  mm         6/5  is    106.54 mm</p><p>1       9.828<br/>2      19.656    126.42   mm         5/4  is    127.9  mm</p><p>1       8.935<br/>4      35.74     162.16   mm         4/3  is    159.9 mm</p><p>1       7.4136<br/>3      22.241    184.4    mm         45/32  is  184.87 mm</p><p>1       6.3<br/>4      25.2      209.6    mm         3/2  is    213.36 mm</p><p>And so on...</p><p>My initial quick calculations with paper, pencil and ruler were<br/>within 2 mm of these calculator- and Scala-assisted calculations.<br/>There are rounding errors in the chart above, I&acute;ll do more accurate<br/>calculations when I have the time (perhaps kind and precision-loving<br/>souls will help out here). My first rough &quot;analog&quot; measurements<br/>wound up about 1 mm higher than the octave/halfway point on my<br/>guitar, and very clear just intervals throughout (I tried to finger<br/>sarod-style on the now-fretless guitar, the physical envelope of<br/>error and possibility in playing was about 3-4 mm).</p><p>(By raising the virtual nut and lowering the bridge and frets in<br/>Scala, i.e. bringing everything closer to the instruments of ancient<br/>descent I have observed, the results seem to be even closer, have to<br/>verify this.)</p><p>This is how it works, please try it yourself with different lengths<br/>and possible branching-off points as described below!</p><p>First of all, the octave/reference point is the octave as tangibly<br/>present on a stringed instrument: the halfway point (give or take<br/>tiny variations due to the relationships between nut, bridge and<br/>string height, which have to be dealt with on the specific<br/>instrument itself). Therefore our &quot;srutis&quot; will be measured, in this<br/>example, against a length of 323 mm. So we calculate our physical<br/>tuning/fretting units from the octave, but they will show up<br/>rationally against the open string.</p><p>We divide our octave by 22. (323/22 in this case) Now we have 22<br/>equal divisions of string length. (EDL). Because the traditional<br/>idea of 4,3 or 2 sruti comprising an interval simply rings true to<br/>me as the kind of idea that would last through the centuries even if<br/>its origins were lost, I measured four of these EDL units. See the<br/>result above- interesting but not conclusive about anything much.</p><p>Now- here is the most important part- our string is no longer 646<br/>(323) mm long, it has been shortened by 58.72 mm. (Stopped at the<br/>first fret). So, still measuring against our octave, we have a<br/>string length of (323 minus 58.72), or 264.2727...  Once again<br/>divide by 22, giving us our next &quot;sruti&quot; size. Taking four of these<br/>units and adding them to the first fret, we get the result shown<br/>above (once again please verify on your own!).</p><p>And now simply repeat the process. Each time, the EDL is from the<br/>new length of the string, in other words, from the last fret.</p><p>The first measurent and grouping is, obviously, very crucial.<br/>Hopefully others will help exploring what happens when we branch off<br/>from  2 or three units in the first group, for example. However, any<br/>intervals found with this method are curiously consistent in<br/>character, you can&acute;t just find any damn interval you&acute;d like.</p><p>The rule about 4, 3, or two units certainly worked for me here (I<br/>just went on instinct and it turned out as above, on the first try).<br/>There are probably discoverable rules about alternating group sizes<br/>that would guarantee a 3/2, etc.</p><p>Now, for the second step I am going to take a liberty, justified so:</p><p>a: The fifth as reckoned above is a hair flat (it landed dead on the<br/>center of the former equal-tempered fifth fret-slot in my initial<br/>physical measurements, as far as I could tell from the millimeter<br/>ruler).</p><p>b:I know there are tiny rounding errors in the chart above, but they<br/>do accumulate because we&acute;re measuring from fret to fret, not from a<br/>fixed point.</p><p>c: This system may not be exact (see below).</p><p>d: The default string settings in Scala may be off from the settings<br/>with which this system works best.</p><p>e: If this happens to be reinventing some kind of historical system,<br/>it would certainly be &quot;eared&quot; in process, just as intonation is<br/>adjusted to this day by ear, even with lasers, electronics, and<br/>computers assisting us.</p><p>f: The beatless fifth has been nailed since time out of mind, by ear.</p><p>The small liberty I will take now will be to measure the next<br/>interval from the theoretically perfect fret position of the 3/2<br/>interval, less than 4mm above the spot we landed on previously (in<br/>this case).</p><p>This gives us, with new &quot;sruti&quot; from our now-perfect 3/2:</p><p>1  4.9836<br/>4  19.9345   233.294 mm    128/81 is 235 mm</p><p>hohohohoho....</p><p>My experiences with fretting and intonating guitars tell me that<br/>these differences are due to the &quot;action&quot;.</p><p>Notice that four of these variable measurement units at this point<br/>no longer represent an interval of ~10/9, but an interval of<br/>~256/243.</p><p>What is actually going on here? We&acute;re squaring the circle, drawing<br/>curves with straight lines... doing algorithms with basic arithmetic<br/>and chunks of hardwood.</p><p>This may have nothing to do with Indian music at all, the use of the<br/>number 22 being a sheer coincidence. At any rate, I&acute;m calling these<br/>EDvL&acute;s (see below, :-) ) &quot;Zhivan units&quot;,  after my son.</p><p>Whether or not all of this has anything to do with Indian music, the<br/>number 22, I suspect, is no coincidence at all. For no reason I can<br/>think of, as I was first calculating these intervals, I wrote down<br/>the ratio 22/7- figuring some kind of imaginary EDL diatonic scale<br/>maybe. Calculating this, there was Pi smiling at me, accurate to the<br/>second decimal and very close from there on. Checking on the<br/>Internet today, I find, to no surprise, that 22/7 is an ancient and<br/>quite accurate approximation of Pi.</p><p>I suspect that these variable-EDL, or EDvL (equal division of<br/>variable length) units are not length/22, but length/7*Pi in size.<br/>As I find time, I will try to verify this. And I suspect that the 7<br/>represents some kind of limit- prime, odd, something, and other<br/>numbers can be used to find either a more complex, or completely<br/>different, tuning.</p><p>This is extremely fun but now I have to prepare for some workshops<br/>and concerts, not to mention have a beer or three, take care.</p><p>-Cameron Bobr</p></div><h3><a id=67536 href="#67536">ðŸ”—</a>misterbobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2006 6:31:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here are some more results using the Zhivan unit Zh :-), using the<br/>same string length and settings as yesterday but trying different<br/>groupings of these units.

But Zhivan units is good<br/>too ;-)</p><p>About the &quot;2, 3, or 4&quot;, and your hunches about which one to choose -<br/>the only rationale you&apos;ve give so far is that they might need to add<br/>up to groups of 7; I didn&apos;t understand quite why you think that.</p><p>You made a comment about branching; without a particular impetus to<br/>choose just one of the &quot;2, 3, or 4&quot; as your &quot;Zhivan-count&quot;<br/>(or &quot;sruticount&quot; or &quot;stepcount&quot;), we could obviously end up with a<br/>whole forest (OK, mathematically just a tree, but a pretty dense<br/>one) of different tunings, each arising from just one choice out of<br/>3^7 for a heptatonic.</p><p>These 2,787 different tunings would:<br/>(1) have some frets fall close enough to others FAPP (=for all<br/>practical purposes, eg within 3mm) (see note *); and<br/>(2) require some slight adjustment to a few of the frets for say,<br/>the major sixth, when changing from one tuning to another.</p><p>So it follows that each step (eg Da, the sixth diatonic step above<br/>the tonic Sa) would occupy a range of closely-grouped positions on<br/>the fretboard.  This seems to me to be, at least superficially, a<br/>good reason for the existence of this phenomenon in classical Indian<br/>music.</p><p>Without detracting from your emphasis on finding a practical tuning<br/>and fretting system, it would be interesting to spreadsheet the<br/>whole tree of Zhivan tunings arising from the different choices<br/>of &quot;Zhivan-count&quot; at each juncture, then plot the resulting fret<br/>locations and inspect the graph for natural coincidences and<br/>groupings.</p><p>Of course, we needn&apos;t focus only on 7; we could look for the 5, or<br/>12, or 19, or 22, ... best natural groupings to find scales of<br/>different sizes using Zhivan tuning.</p><p>---</p><p>Notes:<br/>(*) This is easy to see;, for example, the choices ... a, b ...<br/>and ... b, a ... of &quot;Zhivan-count&quot; would necessarily cover the same<br/>proportions of the Remaining Length, RL.  The choice ... a, b ...<br/>leaves the proportion (1-a/22)(1-b/22) of RL; similarly the second<br/>choice leaves the same proportion (1-b/22)(1-a/22) of RL.  Also,<br/>constraining successive choices so that they (sometimes or always)<br/>add to 7 would also ensure that there would be a fret at either<br/>R1=(1-3/22)(1-4/22) or R2=(1-3/22)(1-2/22)^2 of the RL from any<br/>other fret.  Now R1=1-7/22+12/22^2 and R2=R1+4/22^2(1-3/22), which<br/>work out to R1=.7066115 and R2=R1+.0285499.  [Both these are larger<br/>than P=(1-1/pi)~=(1-1/3.141592)=.6816901, although R1 is nearer to P<br/>than to R2.  And a 7 of 22 division of RL is a lot easier to find<br/>than a (1/pi)-fold division of RL!  Though that gives me an idea ...<br/>see note (&amp;) below.]</p><p>(&amp;) I know how to place a fret at 1/pi of the RL, but it takes a<br/>fair few words to explain fully.  (Funny, considering how the<br/>picture that popped into my head explains it all much more<br/>clearly!)  In lieu of the picture, here&apos;s the 1,000 words (you have<br/>been warned):</p><p>We can do this using simple tools - a cone (maybe turned in wood, or<br/>bent in sheet metal) used as a nomogram, together with a measuring<br/>string, which must be thin, flexible, strong and not at all<br/>stretchy.  The cone has a length scale on one side, which represents<br/>the diameter of the cone at that point.  The scale has its origin<br/>(zero point) at the tip of the cone.</p><p>Inscribe a set of parallel circles around the cone at fixed heights<br/>and the smallest practical equal distance apart, eg about 1 or 2 mm,<br/>depending on the material.  Be sure to take the circles as near the<br/>tip of the cone as practical.  The circles should make shallow<br/>grooves in the surface.  Together, the circular grooves constitute a<br/>scale representing the circumferences of the cone for different<br/>diameters.</p><p>If desired, calibrate the scale using a string as a measure on the<br/>cone itself; thus it would be most practical to set the unit of<br/>measure to the maximum diameter on the scale, at or near the lip<br/>(base) of the cone; label this point 1.  Establish fractional points<br/>on the diameter scale by repeated division (folding of the measuring<br/>string) and adding.  BTW, the only necessary points on the scale are<br/>the origin and the unit diameter.</p><p>The cone has to be of such size that the Semilength of the string<br/>being tuned (the length of the string at the natural octave) is<br/>equal to, or slightly less than, the circumference of the cone at<br/>the point marked 1 on the diameter scale.</p><p>The tools are now complete.</p><p>To set off a distance 1/pi of the RL (Remaining Length), starting<br/>when RL = S (the Semilength), use the measuring string to transfer<br/>the RL from the tuning string to the best fitting one of the set of<br/>parallel circular grooves on the cone&apos;s surface.  Using this &quot;groove<br/>of best fit&quot; (and don&apos;t we all want to find that?), find its<br/>intersection with the diameter scale.  From that point to the apex,<br/>set off the diameter on the edge of the cone with the measuring<br/>string; transfer this diameter to the tuning string, from the last-<br/>tuned fret towards the natural octave point, thereby reducing the RL<br/>by RL/pi.</p><p>Should you *want* to tune by subtracting (1/pi)th, rather than<br/>(some/22)th, of the remaining string length, these tools would let<br/>you do the job.  They would be easily constructed using no<br/>technology more complex than a springy-tree-branch- or foot-powered<br/>lathe.  You don&apos;t even need a ruler!  By carefully calibrating the<br/>diameter scale, you could also use halves, quarters, etc of (1/pi).<br/>Using the tools alone, you could also calibrate the diameters (and<br/>hence the fret positions) in *powers* of (1/pi).</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=67542 href="#67542">ðŸ”—</a>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2006 11:59:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yahya_melb&quot; &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; (&amp;) I know how to place a fret at 1/pi of the RL, but it takes a<br/>&gt; fair few words to explain fully.

A slightly less  ambitious goal might seek to answer<br/>this:  what rules provide _playable_ fret placements  with between<br/>(say) 5 and 25 frets per octave.  But what is playable?</p><p>Playable fret placements<br/>------------------------<br/>allow the player to stop (and preferably also to bend) the string<br/>with the fingertip  cleanly on the fingerboard behind each fret,<br/>rather than straddling the next fret behind  it.  This mandates a<br/>minimum distance between frets for any particular player, which<br/>needs  to be larger for those player with big hands, so unless it&apos;s<br/>a bespoke instrument for one  player, should be chosen to<br/>accommodate the vast majority of players&apos; hands.</p><p>Similarly, the guitar fingerboard can&apos;t be much longer than the<br/>usual two handspans, or  430mm (@), without making it impossible for<br/>many players to reach all the frets.  Nor can  the string be much<br/>longer than the usual three handspans, or 645mm (@), without both<br/>moving  the bridge too far towards the edge of the soundbox to<br/>create appropriate resonances (#)  and making the notes of a major<br/>third far wider than the player&apos;s stretch (ability to reach  from<br/>one hand position).  In short, the maximum string length and fret<br/>separation both  depend on the player&apos;s handspan and arm length (tho<br/>a guitar tuned in major thirds instead  of fourths might accommodate<br/>a proportionately longer string and fingerboard).</p><p>These are essentially physical limitations which any observer, even<br/>without special  knowledge of instrument making, could note.  My<br/>impression is that, even if we stretched  the fingerboard by a<br/>quarter, and tuned the strings in major thirds, few guitar players<br/>could make much use of frets placed more than twice as closely as on<br/>a 12-EDO guitar.  In  other words, the smallest interval we can<br/>practically fret at the high end, nearest the  sound hole and<br/>bridge, is about a quartertone, with fret separation around 6 to 7<br/>mm,  instead of the current 13mm (@).  At the low end, near the nut,<br/>we could use the same fret  separation, instead of the current 35 to<br/>36mm (@), giving pitch resolution of about a  tenth- or twelfth-<br/>tone.</p><p>So it&apos;s the top end that limits our playable resolution, which I<br/>reckon at about 24-EDO for  most players.  Providing extra frets at<br/>the bottom end would certainly give better  resolution there, but<br/>one that could not be maintained in higher registers.  Eg frets<br/>spaced at 1/53-EDO at the bottom end might be (just) playable, but<br/>for the second octave to  be playable, we&apos;d have to space them at<br/>2/53- or 3/53-EDO.</p><p>This is my (fairly naive) take on what frettings would be playable<br/>by enough players to be practicable.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve missed some<br/>relevant fact well-known to luthiers!</p><p>(@) measured on my flat-top guitar.

Allowing<br/>for the contracting RL, second order effects would  push this number<br/>up to at least 9, maybe even 12 - I haven&apos;t done exact calculations<br/>yet.</p><p>So, to summarise, using Cameron&apos;s Zhivan tuning technique, with:<br/> - 1 Zh = RL/22;<br/> - (&amp;) scale steps of 2, 3 or 4 Zh; and<br/> - (*) most groups of 2 to 3 successive scale steps totalling, on<br/>average, 7 Zh;</p><p>we will get about 9 to 12 scale steps (and thus frets) per octave.<br/>We could label this the Zh(22;2,4;2,3,7) cluster of tunings.</p><p>(*) This expression has two points of vagueness - &quot;most&quot; and &quot;on<br/>average&quot;.  What I&apos;m  getting at is that the average of every group,<br/>except possibly for a very few, relatively,  of them, falls nearer<br/>to 7 Zh than to either 6 or 8 Zh or any other number of Zh.  A couple<br/>of outliers will not change the picture greatly, provided their<br/>deviation from average is  &quot;not too great&quot;.  This loose statement<br/>could be tightened up and formalised if necessary.</p><p>(&amp;) If this condition is not specified, a similar, but generally<br/>weaker, pair of limits  results.  In the absence of this<br/>restriction, from what I wrote earlier it follows that  some (^)<br/>scale steps are no bigger than 2 Zh and some (^) scale steps are no<br/>smaller than 4<br/>Zh.</p><p>(^) &quot;some&quot; here has its meaning in logic: &quot;at least one&quot;.</p><p>---</p><p>Suppose we want to divide the octave into, say, 22 Zhivan scale<br/>steps, rather than 9 to 12.</p><p> What size should the Zhivan unit be?</p><p>Let&apos;s generalise the above assumptions to:<br/> - 1 Zh = RL/m;<br/> - scale steps of a, a+1, ..., b-1 or b Zh; and<br/> - most groups of c to d successive scale steps total, on average, n<br/>Zh;<br/>for some natural numbers m,a,b,c,d,n resulting in about s scale<br/>steps (and thus frets) per  octave.  In this case we want s to be<br/>22.  Label this the Zh(m;a,b;c,d,n) cluster of  tunings.</p><p>Its average scale step size is 2^((n/m)/(product(c,c+1,...,d))^(1/(d-<br/>c+1))), and to  first-order, s = m(product(c,c+1,...,d))^(1/(d-<br/>c+1)))/n.  In particular, for  Zh(m;a,b;2,3,7), s = m(product(2,3))^<br/>(1/2))/7 ~= 0.35m = 7m/20; so m ~= 20s/7, which is not  much short<br/>of 22s/7 or (pi) times s.</p><p>In plain(er) English, this means:<br/>If:<br/> - The Zhyler Zh unit is an Equal Division of Remaining Length into<br/>pi times s parts;<br/> - all scale steps contain between a and b Zh units; and<br/> - most groups of 2 to 3 successive scale steps total, on average, 7<br/>Zh units;</p><p>we will get about s scale steps (and thus frets) per octave.  Note<br/>that this result depends  only on c, d and n.  It does not depend on<br/>the values of a and b at all; however, the third  condition does<br/>constrain the values of a and b for which we can get a Zhyler scale<br/>at all,  as we saw above at note (&amp;).</p><p>To get a Zhyler scale of 22 steps, we need a Zhyler unit of about<br/>22pi parts - an EDRL  (Equal Division of Remaining Length) into 69<br/>parts.  This formula is only approximate, and  can be improved, but<br/>it gives a starting point for the tuning.  It also applies only to<br/>the  Zh(m;a,b;2,3,7) cluster.</p><p>Here are some &quot;first-cut&quot; tunings for Zhyler scales in the<br/>Zh(m;2,4;2,3,7) cluster:<br/> - s*pi-EDRL gives s steps<br/> - 16-EDRL gives 5 steps<br/> - 22-EDRL gives 7 steps<br/> - 38-EDRL gives 12 steps<br/> - 53-EDRL gives 17 steps<br/> - 60-EDRL gives 19 steps<br/> - 69-EDRL gives 22 steps<br/> - 97-EDRL gives 31 steps<br/> - 129-EDRL gives 41 steps<br/> - 167-EDRL gives 53 steps</p><p>For the general Zh(m;a,b;c,d,n) cluster of tunings, an s-step scale<br/>arises when m ~= m0 s,  where m0 = n/(product(c,c+1,...,d))^(1/(d-<br/>c+1))).  This simplifies, when c=d, to m0 = n/c,  so that m ~=<br/>sn/c.  Generally, a and b bracket m0, ie a &lt; m0 &lt; b, where m0 is<br/>given by the  equation above.  Also, in many cases, if a and b are<br/>near to each other, there will be an  s-step scale in the Zh<br/>(sm0;a,b;c,d,n) cluster of tunings.  The further a and b are from<br/>each other, and from m0, the less even the scales will appear.</p><p>For example, if:<br/> - 1 Zh = RL/m; and<br/> - most groups of 4 successive scale steps total, on average, 38 Zh;<br/>then we have:<br/> - m0 = 38/4 = 9.5; and<br/> - most scale steps average m0=9.5 Zh, and have between 1 and (38-<br/>4+1)=35 Zh; it should be  easy to find Zhyler tunings with a,b =<br/>8,10, ie with between 8 and 10 Zh per scale step.</p><p>Then some &quot;first-cut&quot; tunings of the Zh(m;a,b;4,4,38) cluster are:<br/> - 48-EDRL gives 5 steps<br/> - 67-EDRL gives 7 steps<br/> - 114-EDRL gives 12 steps<br/> - 162-EDRL gives 17 steps<br/> - 181-EDRL gives 19 steps<br/> - 209-EDRL gives 22 steps<br/> - 295-EDRL gives 31 steps<br/> - 390-EDRL gives 41 steps<br/> - 504-EDRL gives 53 steps</p><p>&gt; Well I&apos;ve got a heavy day ahead.
