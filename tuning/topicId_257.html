Original numbered copies<br/>of the first La Monte Young/Marian Zazeela LP. Issued by the Edition X<br/>label out of Germany in 1969 (in an edition of 2800 copies), this album has<br/>no formal title but is usually referred to as The Black Record (visually<br/>annotated with stunning Marian Zazeela art and calligraphy). It has only<br/>been available from La Monte &amp; Marian&apos;s MELA Foundation for quite some time<br/>now, for the price of $81.00 (not inappropriate at all, considering it&apos;s<br/>age, artistic stature and pure desirability). It features a 23-minute<br/>section of &quot;Map of 49&apos;s Dreams...&quot; which evolved out of Theatre of Eternal<br/>Music work from 1964. It is performed by La Monte and Marian, for voice and<br/>sine wave drones. This is the only legitimate place to hear an historical<br/>document of their early dream music and it&apos;s a thoroughly massive<br/>experience (despite the crackle, so much for the clarity of German vinyl<br/>engineering in 1969!). Side 2 features a 20-minute excerpt of &quot;Studies in<br/>the Bowed Disc,&quot; performed on bowed gongs. The remaining stock of this LP<br/>is quite finite, so don&apos;t delay if interested.  $81.00</p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/1999 8:54:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mr. Collins<br/>I as well am intersted in LaMonte Young&apos;s music.<br/>Making music is not to reach an audience or be understood(gary this may answer<br/>yor philosophy question as well). True artists are amateurs. The imitators are<br/>what we call professionals/culture is created afterwards by people who percieve<br/>or comprehend what someone was doing to just exist. I cannot judge LY only<br/>experience what has been created and I do not care to be understood nor have an<br/>audience understand anything I do/play/sing. John Tudor once said,&quot;If you don&apos;t<br/>know, why do you ask&quot;. If someone--an audience--already understands then art<br/>becomes entertainment and subsequently commodified. LY refuses to be commodified<br/>so tough luck to all the FANS out there. I personally give my Microtonal<br/>whatever(tet) JI music away for free--so I &amp; the listener are free as well.<br/>sorry but you guys got me on the wrong day.</p><p>Collins wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Collins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:collinsclan@sprintmail.com">collinsclan@sprintmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know if this will help any.
