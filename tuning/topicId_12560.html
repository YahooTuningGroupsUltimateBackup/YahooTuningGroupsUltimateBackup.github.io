In fact, other examples<br/>are the last three Beehoven piano sonatas, particularly op. 109. The first<br/>movement does some pretty strange shifts that really suggest a more flexible<br/>tonal system. Also, I remember hearing a portion of Gyorgy Zamfir&apos;s<br/>recording of music from &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; and some of those<br/>modulations surprised me enough so I can&apos;t recall them at all save that they<br/>were to-oh-tally weird-ass.<br/>Jay<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=12583 href="#12583">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2000 3:02:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Christopher Bailey]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12558">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12558</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was thinking about Dan Stearns&apos; [somewhat cryptic] comments on<br/>&gt; art Tatum&apos;s playing the other day, and yesterday I had a listening<br/>&gt; experience that perhaps was related:   the Adagio from Mahler,<br/>&gt; Symphony 10.
