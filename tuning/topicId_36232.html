I think Gresham&apos;s Law might move people onto another list if it was less aggrivating, but it won&apos;t work if it is also so much less flexible.<br/>On the other hand, if Yahoo goes completely bonkers, which seems increasingly likely, the fact that this other list already exists could be extremely helpful. I suggest keeping it, but I don&apos;t think it will work to move the traffic there as things are now.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2002 6:36:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 05 Apr 2002 14:41:14 -0000, &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Apologies to Chris, who has done some wonderful work trying to set up<br/>&gt;an alternative for us to Yahoo, but I really don&apos;t feel that Chris&apos;<br/>&gt;list is up to our needs.</p><p>Speak for yourself.
