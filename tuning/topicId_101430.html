Were she able to keep her lips and her flute in a constant position allover the playing session (which is physically impossible), then you might test those fingerings that way. Neither can a human voice sing exactly the same pitch twice in a row. While such attempts with a very-well-trained voice can differ by as little as 3 cents, on a standard Boehm flute these differences may vary somewhere between 3 and 10 cents, depending on how much of the flute length is involved. For example, when you play an E5 (which is always played as the 2nd harmonic of E4), a much longer part of the flute length is in action than when you play a C#5 (which is still in the range of the playable 1st harmonics -- i.e. the full tone register).<br/>  #2. Also, it would be appropriate to agree on a common &quot;reference&quot; pitch (like A4=440Hz or A4=435Hz) which should be appropriate for her flute so that she needs to make as few extra intonation adjustments as possible in terms of 12-equal. Compared to continuous intonation adjustments, generally, considerably less attention seems to be payed to the tone hole scaling of the particular flute. But for people like us who aim for possibly the most efficient ways of staying in tune, it&apos;s a very important topic. Only recently (maybe about 15-20 years ago) it&apos;s became clear that the intonation of a flute which was scaled for A4=435Hz can be very difficult to manage if the same flute is to be played with A4=440Hz. Fortunately, many flute makers nowadays are aware of this and therefore many &quot;newer&quot; flutes claim to have their tone hole positions scaled &quot;properly&quot;. The primary reason for this inconvenience was that Boehm had designed his scaling system at the time when A4 was still at 435Hz. Later, when the pitch standard kept rising and people complained for their flutes sounding too low, most flute makers, instead of rescaling the tone hole dimmensions and distances, just started making shorter headjoints, which, of course, is nonsense because it changes the ratios of the effective wavelengths. So if you have an electronic tuner which shows you how much an imcoming sound deviates from 12-equal, what I would recommend is to find such an A4 (or whatever you choose as a reference pitch) where these deviations over the entire flute range are as small as possible when she doesn&apos;t actually make any extra intonation adjustments at all.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=101452 href="#101452">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2011 6:57:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;petrparizek2000&quot; &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   #1.

I have a closed-keyed flute myself and I have done this several times. It certainly works unless you&apos;re concerned about some timbre homogeneity which is lost -- and you can&apos;t play fast this way; and you nee to understand which tones are more affected and which tones are less affected by this method (if a larger part of the flute length is invoved, extra adjustments change the pitch by a smaller amout than when a smaller part of the flute length is active).<br/>If you say she has a high-class flute, she probably has an open-keyed flute, which may offer much better possibilities for microtonality but then the Virtual Flute seems to be helpless because it only considers fingerings where a key is open or closed but not those where a key is partially closed, which is what you can get on an open-keyed flute. The reason I don&apos;t want an open-keyed flute (for the time being) is that I have trouble trying to fully cover some holes when fingering the lowest tones like C#4 or C4.</p><p>&gt; But alternate fingerings will definitely be useful because, if you&apos;re aiming for the note C +40 cents, it has to be easier and more reliable to use a fingering that produces C# -45 cents and lip it down 15 cents, than to use a standard C fingering and lip it up 40 cents. If you can do something easy to get you much closer, why not do that?</p><p>Which is exactly why I suggested that it would be nice to know that the flute is currently more or less in tune with what you want it to be in tune with in the first place, before starting to experiment with some microtonal stuff.<br/>Petr</p></div>
