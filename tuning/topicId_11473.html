Now I would like<br/>dissipate a recurent misinterpretation of my (apparent exclusive) attention<br/>to just ratios (in last point). I&apos;ll take citations in reverse order.</p><p>[1]</p><p>You wrote</p><p>&lt;&lt; So, are just ratios really enough to explain Indian music, or is there some<br/>more? What about the melodic quality of all the steps? &gt;&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m not qualified to speak about music in general and again much less about<br/>Indian music. My general opinion is : musical phenomenon is much more rich<br/>and complex than what it is written about and what it will be written in<br/>future.</p><p>And by analogy I would say :</p><p>There is much more in phonology than in acoustic.<br/>There is much more in language than in phonology.<br/>There is much more in litterature than in language.</p><p>So my attention to ratios don&apos;t mean I&apos;m attempting to reduce reality. It&apos;s<br/>only a specialized attack of &quot;algorithmic compression&quot; on data restricted<br/>to intervals.</p><p>[2]</p><p>You wrote (on just srutis)</p><p>&lt;&lt; Many theorists do that as well: Alain Dani&eacute;lou for instance. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t have nothing like knowledge that could be compared to those of<br/>great specialists of music. But my weakness is my strenght. Indian system<br/>of 22 srutis is just, for me, an excellent illustration for derivative<br/>power of a universal axiomatic theory. I did&apos;nt develop concepts to fit<br/>reality. It&apos;s only after, by chance, that I&apos;ve found this almost perfect<br/>case of macrotonal coherence such as I&apos;d soon theorized.</p><p>[3]</p><p>You wrote</p><p>&lt;&lt; In your research you seem to consider the shrutis all the time as just<br/>ratios. &gt;&gt;</p><p>There are three aspects about this remark I would like to comment.</p><p>----- First aspect</p><p>My clean numbers show almost only tempered srutis and common rational<br/>relations connecting just and tempered structures.</p><p>Traditional mathematical approach of &quot;tempered/just&quot; conflict in attempt to<br/>balance &quot;coherence in combinatory of width&quot; with &quot;good qualities of<br/>sonance&quot;, use irrational numbers. Reason is clear. None finite simple<br/>algebra structure like group structure exists which allies more than one<br/>independant rational factor and algebra closure. Then, groups of tempered<br/>tones are usually common frame of work. Finding modes with good melodic and<br/>harmonic properties in such frame concern much more musical judgement than<br/>mathematical possibilities.</p><p>The tempered representation of intervals is truncated. It contains only<br/>information on width. In number 200 or 204 (cents) we can&apos;t seen which is<br/>more consonant. But the problem is not at this level, for a simple<br/>logarithm calculation can resolve it. In a set of tempered tones, the best<br/>fit for consonance on individual basis can&apos;t constitute a coherent<br/>algebraic set nor an harmonic coherent choice. Complex macrotonal analysis<br/>of all the set, with non easy ponderation of two &quot;fudge&quot; factors, are<br/>necessary on mathematical basis to propose pertinent structure that may<br/>retain musical attention.</p><p>I have wanted to solve the problem at fundamental basis. Which simple<br/>algebraic structure is possible, like group (which is very important for<br/>mind), if closure is relaxed (for obvious goal to process directly<br/>rationals) ? By a suprizing paradox, I&apos;ve found solution of that pure<br/>mathematical problem in musical concept of chord. What remains on chord if<br/>we do abstraction of rationality or sonance qualities ? Answer : there<br/>exist a unique solution of linear equation (ax=b) where a and b are on the<br/>chord. This &quot;nothing&quot; was a key allowing macrotonality.</p><p>Decoupling macrotonality of microtonality, it has been possible to<br/>construct, on pure mathematical basis, the appropriate structure in which<br/>rationals and tempered correponding can be commonly process. Obviously, I<br/>can&apos;t develop here this theory of chordoid.</p><p>With the tools derived in this frame of chordoid structure, we can now<br/>manage bidimensional information on intervals and express relations that<br/>are invariant in tempered approximation.</p><p>My concern is not tones (just or tempered) with which we can do<br/>calculation, in other words, it&apos;s not arithmetic but algebra. Algebra<br/>manages universal relations on a structured set of elements, independently<br/>of individuality of elements.</p><p>The most important step from there (after first problem is resolved) is to<br/>explicit how simplicity of group is possible. Which axioms give isomorphism<br/>of tones&apos; class on cyclical group of degrees like it&apos;s in use since<br/>millenaries. I&apos;m astonished that Z/12 (frame) group were remarked while Z/7<br/>(musical) group were neglected. (Probably fishes don&apos;t remark water. :)<br/>It&apos;s just a break to change aspect.)</p><p>----- Second aspect</p><p>I don&apos;t have a particular interest on JI tones derived from opinion on best<br/>intonation. I wrote in &quot;F&eacute;tichisme du num&eacute;rique et rationalit&eacute; musicale&quot;<br/>what I think about obsessive precision on tuning. Global context perception<br/>seems to me much more important in musical flow than acoustical phenomenon<br/>tracked only with attention.</p><p>In my opinion, what is important in Indian Srutis System is global impact<br/>on the music (how such raga has to be played) and not the possible number<br/>of cents out-of-tune. I would think that much good music are made with<br/>instuments lightly out-of-tune and much insignificant music with<br/>instruments perfectly tuned. I would say also that lattitude of expressive<br/>variations by good musicians is large compared with the few cents of<br/>mistuning, and that the referential allowing variations&apos; significance is in<br/>the brain and not in the instrument.</p><p>I recall an experience (reported in La Recherche 229, feb 1991, Un<br/>synth&eacute;tiseur dans la brousse, S. Aroum) on very large possible gap between<br/>instrument tuning (xylophone) and musical perception. A synthesizer has<br/>first been precisely tuned by autochtones. Analysis of tuning was unable to<br/>reveal scale structure. Returning with voice recorder reveals well-known<br/>pentatonic modes and an accomodation (with large tolerance) of a unique<br/>xylophone&apos;s tuning for use with  all modes.</p><p>----- Third aspect</p><p>The thought scheme explaining my propension to isolate intervals (and<br/>numbers about them) is what I would call the relatively independance of<br/>tonal segment among various segments of intelligibility. Central concept is<br/>parametric invariance in acoustic channel.</p><p>Timbre recognizing stands on complex invariance perception. This highly<br/>sophisticated ability of mind to track source of sound (I don&apos;t mean as<br/>position but as significance) was important for survivance. Music inherit<br/>of this ability and use it largely in a proper segment of intelligibility.</p><p>Global ordering structure of intensities is also an invariant which opens<br/>on a new segment of intelligibility. Timbres don&apos;t have this type of<br/>invariance. Intensity and tempo continue variations are probably the main<br/>vector of emotion.</p><p>(( Another segments may be found also in relation with our natural<br/>insertion. There exist an instinctive comprehension of sounds expressed by<br/>animals. I like cats and I express relatively well sounds they like. But I<br/>don&apos;t theorize on that. ))</p><p>Important thing is the following. There exist a UNIQUE ELEMENTARY INVARIANT<br/>in acoustic channel (if relative source position is fixed). It&apos;s time. It&apos;s<br/>why duration intervals and frequency intervals may alone support algebraic<br/>structure which necessitate elementary invariance for conservation of<br/>composition law under width or intensity translation.</p><p>Intervals are not forcely what is most important in music. Acousmatic don&apos;t<br/>use them. But they defines alone tonal intelligibility segment. Simple<br/>algebraic structures on intervals act as paradigm to construct (in mind)<br/>similitude class of forms spread out on syntagmatic axis by compositors.<br/>Reason is that fast decoding of evolutive (varying) forms in flow context<br/>necessitate categorial perception of intervals as positions in a discrete<br/>structure. This fast schematic apprehension is completed, obviouly, by<br/>other sensitive perceptions.</p><p>----------</p><p>I stop here. And I take a break on the List.
