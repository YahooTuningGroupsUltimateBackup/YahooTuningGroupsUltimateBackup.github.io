The progression of scale<br/>degrees with her tunings (cents relative to 12-tET) is as follows:</p><p>forward in time ----&gt;</p><p>0 (C):           0.00*         -27.27<br/>1    : -37.04                                  +13.70*<br/>2 (D):                  +3.91*         -23.36<br/>3    :  -5.86* -33.13                                   -5.86<br/>4 (E):                          +7.81*         -19.43<br/>5 (F):          -1.95* -29.22<br/>6    : -38.99                          +11.72*<br/>7 (G):                  +1.95* -25.32<br/>8    :         -35.08                          +15.65*<br/>9 (A):                          +5.86* -21.41<br/>10   :  -3.91*         -31.18                           -3.91<br/>11(B):                                  +9.77* -17.48</p><p>  *These start earlier, then are joined by the other notes.</p><p>There is a circle along the pythagorean chain: Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#<br/>-G#, with all the tunings consistent, but the final chord snaps back to<br/>Eb-Bb rather than continuing the trend to D#-A#; thus there is a melodic<br/>fifth degree (G# to Eb) which is flat by a full pythagorean comma as the<br/>final chord sounds.</p><p>The fifths are joined (except at the end) by two other notes forming<br/>in each case a 12:14:18:21 chord.  As the above chart shows, this<br/>results in notes on the same nominal scale degree being differently<br/>tuned by 63:64 (about 27.3 cents) over a short period of time.</p><p>The challenges, on paper, of this small sequence are many.  The ear must<br/>accept melodic shifts of about 1/4 semitone, very different from<br/>&quot;normal&quot; music heard by Western ears.  Then there is the pythagorean<br/>comma (23.5 cents) at the end, though this time it&apos;s at least a<br/>deviation from some interval other than unison!</p><p>To my surprise, none of these challenges is audible to my ear.  The<br/>sequence sounds &quot;fine&quot;, howbeit the chords are deliciously dark in a<br/>way not possible without microtuning.  I don&apos;t hear any objectionable<br/>motion whatever.</p><p>Just for fun, I thought I&apos;d see how closely my adaptive tuning program<br/>could be made to approximate Margo&apos;s tuning of this sequence.  This<br/>represents a _serious_ challenges to my methods, because I am unable to<br/>recognize some important features:</p><p>   . Many scale degrees (in the 12-tET world) need to be recognized as<br/>     multiple scale degrees in the target sequence for grounding<br/>     purposes.</p><p>   . The maintaining of consistency of the tuning through the circle of<br/>     fifths would depend upon some kind of melodic springs across the<br/>     fifth degree.</p><p>These challenges, especially the first, represent severe limitations to<br/>my methods, ones which over time I want to overcome, just to be able<br/>to handle sequences such as this (and meantone scales with more than<br/>12 notes, and...).</p><p>I had to alter many of my input parameters to extreme values just to<br/>make a sound at all similar, and _still_ didn&apos;t do a very good job:</p><p>   . To allow a given scale degree to have markedly different tunings<br/>     in a very short time span, I had to make horizontal springs very<br/>     weak (I used 1/100 of usual values).</p><p>   . For the same reason, grounding springs had to be made very weak<br/>     (again I used 1/100 of usual values).</p><p>   . I made up a tuning file that targets septimal intervals (7:6 and<br/>     9:7) in order to match Margo&apos;s chord tunings; this at least I&apos;ve<br/>     got fairly well covered in the methods I already support.</p><p>Here&apos;s how close I came (file sesci001mar1.mid):</p><p>0 (C):         +15.82*         -18.85<br/>1    : -16.55                                  +13.40*<br/>2 (D):                 +16.16*         -18.53<br/>3    : +12.23* -16.28                                   -1.42<br/>4 (E):                         +16.19*         -18.33<br/>5 (F):         +12.50* -15.94<br/>6    : -19.48                          +16.48*<br/>7 (G):                 +12.84* -15.92<br/>8    :         -19.21                          +16.70*<br/>9 (A):                         +12.87* -15.60<br/>10   : +15.55*         -18.87                           +0.56<br/>11(B):                                 +13.18* -15.41</p><p>  *These start earlier, then are joined by the other notes.</p><p>Even with severely weakened horizontal and grounding springs, vertical<br/>intervals are compromised by a few cents.  All sense of a pythagorean<br/>chain in the circle of fifths is lost.  Also, not shown, there is<br/>significant horizontal motion (about 4 cents) as each dyad becomes a<br/>tetrad, in notes continuously sounding, a byproduct of the weakened<br/>horizontal springs.  At least, to my ear, the progression does sound<br/>superficially similar to Margo&apos;s.</p><p>I am indebted to Margo for this illustrative sequence: the extent to<br/>which it sounds natural is a great surprise to me.  It also provides an<br/>excellent test sequence to use as I attempt to make my methods more<br/>generally applicable to sequences with more than 12 scale degrees per<br/>octave.</p><p>Oh, and here are Margo&apos;s and my tunings:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid</a> (original JI sequence)<br/><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesciat1.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesciat1.mid</a> (adaptive tuning version)</p><p>Thanks, Margo!!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/28/2001 2:27:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25717">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25717</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even with severely weakened horizontal and grounding springs,<br/>vertical intervals are compromised by a few cents.
