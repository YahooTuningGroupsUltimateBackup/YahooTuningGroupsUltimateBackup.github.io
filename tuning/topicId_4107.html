I just felt that you kind of wrote those guys off,<br/>&gt; as if they were unimportant.</p><p>Whew !!!   Glad we cleared up that misunderstanding!!</p><p>I describe in detail in my autobiography (on my website)<br/>how Partch&apos;s book was instrumental in arousing my interest<br/>in just-intonation, and tuning in general, in the first place.</p><p>What&apos;s so interesting to me is that I had no real interest<br/>in any of the subject matter of _Genesis_ when I bought it (1979,<br/>during my freshman year of college at Manhattan School of Music),<br/>yet for some unknown reason I purchased it anyway.  I suppose<br/>the color pictures of the cool-looking home-made instruements<br/>had a lot to do with it, as I had tried my hand at making various<br/>instruments when I was younger.</p><p>Perhaps my initial perplexion upon encountering the math, as I<br/>browsed thru the book in the store, embedded itself in my mind<br/>as a challenge for the future, which it certainly was for me<br/>when I finally began to understand what Partch was saying (around<br/>1982, a year after dropping out of music school).</p><p>And his numerous references to Helmholtz and, even more, to Ellis,<br/>had me running out to get _On The Sensations Of Tone_, which<br/>to this day I still haven&apos;t digested completely (that is, with<br/>the kind of thoroughness with which I&apos;ve internalized _Genesis_).</p><p>&gt; As for Doty&apos;s book - it&apos;s fundamental.</p><p>I definitely agree to this.  If my published ramblings make it<br/>seem as tho I&apos;m brushing off _The Just Intonation Primer_, it&apos;s<br/>only because my first encounter with Doty&apos;s book was well after<br/>I had completed several drafts of my own book, and it covers I lot<br/>of the material I researched independently.  All that means is<br/>that Doty&apos;s book was not the wonderful revelation to me that<br/>Partch&apos;s was, and that Doty&apos;s book was for many other people<br/>(apparently including you).</p><p>But I certainly didn&apos;t mean to belittle its important place<br/>in the microtonal literature - it&apos;s probably the most comprehensive<br/>*basic* reference for JI beginners.  It simply doesn&apos;t go into<br/>the kind of detail my book does.  I suppose mine would be<br/>considered as being for a reader in the intermediate to advanced<br/>level.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
