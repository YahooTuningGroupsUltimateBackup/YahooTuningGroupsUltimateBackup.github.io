Later, this turned out to be false. Then some theorists suggested 5-limit ratios. Unfortunately, this brought more questions than answers, like &quot;why were there no 7-limit intervals&quot; or &quot;why these 5-limit intervals and not others&quot;. A couple of papers on the subject were full of statements like &quot;Bharata was incorrect as the shrutis should be 23 of them and not 22&quot; (or even 25) or &quot;some fifths are pure and others need to be adjusted&quot; or &quot;one can&apos;t take Bharata&apos;s words literally because this sentence just doesn&apos;t make sense or contradicts what he said before&quot;. For several years already, there&apos;s some new evidence arising (although very faintly by this time) that Bharata, most probably, meant the &quot;ideal&quot; fifths to be pure and that his suggestion was to use the 2D Pythagorean system to sort of imitate a 3D system (5-limit JI). Of course, it&apos;s now pointless to speculate whether he cared about the ~2 cent nistuning from pure thirds or not. Interestingly enough, in contrast to the past vague statements, 1) the given explanations are fully logical and 2) possible translations of Bharata suddenly seem to start making sense even in those formerly condemned &quot;critical&quot; passages. And just because of these logical explanations, even if it later turns out that the shrutis were still something else, I&apos;m probably going to stick to this interpretation for quite some time. I won&apos;t go into great detail right now but just to stress the point, we shouldn&apos;t forget that an octave is said to have 12 &quot;swarastanas&quot;. On the Anaphoria website, there&apos;s one such article where the author describes these as a chain of pure fifths, the difference being that he sets it from Fb to A and renders the &quot;C major scale&quot; as &quot;C_D_Fb_F_G_A_Cb_C&quot;. To make transposition possible, since there&apos;s the rule that every scale should include a pure fifth, one extreme is -10 to +1 fifth and another is 0 to +11 fifths. And if we use all of these tones to get all the desired intervals, we get a 22-tone scale and there&apos;s absolutely no need to &quot;adjust&quot; anything.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=96416 href="#96416">ðŸ”—</a>anton_pann &#x3C;anton_pann@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2011 7:38:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks.
