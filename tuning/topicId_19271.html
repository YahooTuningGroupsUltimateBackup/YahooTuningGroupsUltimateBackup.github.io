If<br/>&gt; you are totally unwilling to do it yourself, can you help find<br/>&gt; someone who could?</p><p>...<br/>&gt; Jeff Scott -- QUARTERTONES; NON-JUST, NON-EQUAL TUNINGS<br/>...</p><p>Hi Dan, thank you for helping us get started by making<br/>this list of possibilities.</p><p>I will compile what I have on quarter tones and post it<br/>and then ask Stephen Soderberg to help fine-tune and fill<br/>in the large blanks since he is more knowledgeable than I.<br/>I will also ask Margo to help me with the harmonic<br/>resources angle (I recall someone saying she had posted<br/>rather eruditely on this subject... I will try to find her<br/>post and summarize it.)</p><p>Now I do fancy myself a super big expert on:</p><p> 1. nonoctave equal tunings<br/> 2. nonoctave just tunings</p><p>And thus will be wrassling up the following:</p><p>Q: Nonoctave tunings? What do you mean?</p><p>Q: Nonoctave tunings? Are you out of your mind?</p><p>Q: I was told the octave is physiologically necessary<br/>   and have seen statements to that effect in a large<br/>   number of books and you think you&apos;re smarter than<br/>   those books?</p><p>Q: How do you respond to all the research that prove<br/>   that nonoctave tunings won&apos;t work?</p><p>Q: What are the well-known nonoctave tunings and<br/>   what do they have in common?</p><p>Q: What composers are working in nonoctave tunings?</p><p>Q: Have nonoctave tunings been used in the past and/or<br/>   are they commonly used in other cultures?</p><p>Q: What&apos;s this I hear about pianos all being tuned<br/>   all nonoctavely and stuff?</p><p>-----<br/>Any way that will get me started -- I am claiming first<br/>shot at all these questions as my own! I had not plannned<br/>to address nonoctave nonjust nonequal because there are<br/>many others far more qualified than myself.</p><p>However, I will look around and see what is written about<br/>nonjust nonequal tunings and put together something to get<br/>people started if someone doesn&apos;t beat me to it.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>-- Jeff</p></div>
