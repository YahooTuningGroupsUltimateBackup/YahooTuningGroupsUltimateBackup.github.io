S. Bach and he<br/>&gt; also states that some of the Piagui flat fifths will be MORE out of tune<br/>&gt; than equal temperament and not less.</p><p>What?</p><p>I suppose that your interrogation (What?) is in conexion with &quot;it was criticized by its<br/>own adopter J. S. Bach&quot; because the rest is part of your message.<br/>J. S. Bach&acute;s son declared that his father was not satisfied with the equal<br/>tempered scale; somewhere I have this information.<br/>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>&gt; The above relations conclude that the frequencies and quotients that define<br/>&gt; the needed flat fifths that are criticized by Mike are not common numbers,<br/>&gt; otherwise the triad chord wave peaks would not have been aesthetic<br/>&gt; responses.</p><p>You mean they would have been.</p><p>&iquest; Do you deny that the graph responses are aesthetic? If so, there are two possibilities:<br/>1) The transmissions of chord wave peaks have distorted the responses.<br/>2) You are making a comic subject from the serious information given by the chord<br/>wave peaks.</p><p>WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AESTHETIC RESPONSES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Regards</p><p>MARIO PIZARRO<br/>Lima, July 9, 2008</p></div>
