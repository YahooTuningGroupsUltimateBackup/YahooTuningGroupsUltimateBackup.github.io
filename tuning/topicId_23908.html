As I can&apos;t manage to<br/>get access to my webspace to put up any of my other scores and pieces,<br/>I&apos;ve this to offer for now. Fortunately the score can be presented in<br/>its full glory in a simple text editor so here it is :-</p><p>*************************************************************************************************</p><p>Mantras Converging on Silence</p><p>Performance preparation time - at least two weeks.</p><p>Instruments - Ideally - at least one stringed instrument capable of<br/>playing microtones. At least one wind instrument capable of playing<br/>microtones. At least one brass instrument capable of playing microtones.<br/>Electronic instruments would make good substitutes. A watch or stopwatch<br/>with a second hand  and a pencil and paper.</p><p>Level - A successful performance requires exceptional concentration and<br/>mental discipline.</p><p>Instructions.</p><p>Block off a two week space in your diary and make a commitment to go for<br/>a walk on 10 out of the 14 days, preferably in nature, for between one<br/>two hours each day or evening. Vary the time of the walk as widely as<br/>possible but keep to the same route every day.</p><p>Plan to start the walk on the hour at any time except between 12 and 1.<br/>Use the 12 hour clock for reference.</p><p>Choose a suitable mantra. Mantras can be provided on request by private<br/>email to the composer. Americans - avoid corporate slogans. Brits -<br/>avoid thuggish football (soccer) chants.</p><p>Loosen up. Stretch. Walk, chanting your mantra silently or aloud to the<br/>exclusion of all other thoughts. When you notice that you have drifted<br/>off from your chant, note the times in the following format : 2.15,<br/>7.25, 11.41 etc. Note also the day the lapses occurred and where you<br/>were on the walk.</p><p>At the end of ten days you will have a batch of times and locations.<br/>(You might also experience a sense of serenity).</p><p>Arrange the times in strict chronological order. These are to be read as<br/>cents, 1200 to the octave. You now have a collection of pitches. These<br/>are to be written as a line of tones.</p><p>Observe the following chart:-</p><p>Sunday - 1  (ff)<br/>Monday -2  (f)<br/>Tuesday -3  (mf)<br/>Wednesday - 4  (mp)<br/>Thursday -5  (p)<br/>Friday - 6  (pp)<br/>Saturday - 7  (ppp)</p><p>You may choose any frequency as a starting point from which to measure<br/>your collection of cents. The numbers refer to the allowable octave<br/>transpositions. For example the tones collected on Tuesday can be octave<br/>transposed up to three times up or down by adding 1200 cents and<br/>multiples thereof.</p><p>Chords. Weekend  tones may be played together as chords. Similarly<br/>weekday tones can be structured vertically to give up to 5 note chords.</p><p>Orchestration, ie assigning tones to wind, string or brass and doubling<br/>is left to the performer(s).</p><p>Rhythmic Groups. It is the performer&apos;s responsibility to arrange the<br/>tones and chords in a rhythmic grouping that corresponds to the rhythm<br/>of the chosen chant, essentially a repetitive structure.</p><p>Tempo is left to the performer but a very slow tempo is recommended.</p><p>Dynamics are given as per the day of collection.</p><p>Articulation. Strings - pizzicatto on Sunday and Friday. Harmonics on<br/>Wednesday. All other days normal.<br/>Wind - fluttertonguing on Thursdays.</p><p>Untuned Percussion may be added ad libitum.</p><p>Remarks. Beginners will produce lengthy compositions with copious notes.<br/>The virtuosic performer will tend towards very few notes, the Master<br/>towards pure silence.</p><p>***************************************************************************************************</p></div>
