I did go back to <a href="http://www.medievel.org">www.medievel.org</a><br/>and grabbed some more great stuff. You might be<br/>interested in or familiar with the 9-tone scale<br/>I mention in this post.</p><p>Paul, thanks for your nice post on music making.</p><p>Lars, that 9-of-17tet was a nice little piece. I&apos;ll<br/>be going back to check out more of your stuff. I<br/>had been working on the same scale form from another<br/>vantage point. I reversed the L and s and had for all<br/>practical purposes a 9 of 24</p><p> L   s   L   s   L   s   L   s   L<br/>0 204 249 453 498 702 747 951 996</p><p>I&apos;m showing the symmetrical form, I don&apos;t really<br/>have a modal preference yet). I was playing around<br/>with dyadic resolutions, two of which seemed<br/>effective (at least I could wander off and come<br/>back to them).</p><p>453 -&gt; 702              204 -&gt; 249<br/>249 -&gt;  0               996 -&gt; 951</p><p>These obviously owe a lot to Margo&apos;s posts, so<br/>thanks again.</p><p>This was all part of a weekend of ear-training and<br/>experimentation. I started with the M scales, got<br/>confused, tried to step back until I could find<br/>limits I could readilly deal with on the keyboard.<br/>I found some successes (meantone P5=697c, yep, I<br/>even know what to do with the &apos;7&apos; limit notes)<br/>(I had some success with this somewhat Gothic 9<br/>tone scale, which I filled out to 12 notes with<br/>some of the sharps and flats I could fit). By<br/>the end of the weekend, I was just listenning to<br/>dyads and wonderring about how to get &apos;there&apos;<br/>(wherever that might be) from here.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
