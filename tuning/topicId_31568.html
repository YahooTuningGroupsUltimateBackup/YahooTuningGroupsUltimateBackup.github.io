I&apos;m not as familiar with the publication as I probably<br/>should be.</p><p>I just ordered this book on temperament... it sounded better than the<br/>discussions and some of the citations that we had about it<br/>previously... we&apos;ll see.  My initial impression was that it &quot;sang the<br/>praises&quot; of 12-tET and that was about all there was to it...</p><p>Thanks so much, Dan, for this post.</p><p>JP</p></div>
