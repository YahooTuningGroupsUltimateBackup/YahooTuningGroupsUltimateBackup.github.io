It goes on to provide drawings and schematics for what<br/>appears to be a very simple analog synthesizer.  The keyboard in the<br/>drawing is simply a 12ET keyboard with each key split into three.  The<br/>instrument in the picture only covers one octave.  (Not exactly the<br/>MicroZone...)  The authors are with the National Technical University of<br/>Athens, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.</p><p>Since the article appears in a consumer electronics journal, we can assume<br/>that the electronics market will be flooded with these instruments any day<br/>now, right?</p><p>kp</p></div>
