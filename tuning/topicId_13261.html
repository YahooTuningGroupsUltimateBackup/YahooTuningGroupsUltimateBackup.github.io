It is not limited to 12TET either.  It<br/>comes with a small library of historical and other tunings, and will quantize<br/>your pitch to, say 19TET for example.</p><p>An Antares&apos; salesman told me (as far as I can tell accurately) that although it<br/>has a library of tunings, it has no ability to define your own such tunings.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking about getting together a signature campaign to lobby Antares to add<br/>the ability to define your own tunings.  Perhaps strangely, what I&apos;d like to<br/>suggest would be to have it read just a plain ol&apos; raw text file of frequencies.<br/>Why?  Two reasons:</p><p>  1. That would be a straight-forward, completely-general, and<br/>     platform-independent way to allow programs like Scala or JI Calc to define<br/>     tunings for it.<br/>  2. That is probably simple enough that they would actually consider doing it.</p><p>Would anybody be willing to willing to back me on this, by which I mean write a<br/>quick letter to Antares saying that you&apos;d like them to add this feature?</p></div><h3><a id=13282 href="#13282">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2000 10:28:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Gary Morrison &lt;MR88CET@T...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Would anybody be willing to willing to back me on this, by which I<br/>mean write a<br/>&gt; quick letter to Antares saying that you&apos;d like them to add this<br/>feature?</p><p>Yes, but they might not listen to me, as I don&apos;t own the software<br/>currently.</p></div><h3><a id=13296 href="#13296">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2000 11:35:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m interested.

They would probably prefer whatever they<br/>use internally.
