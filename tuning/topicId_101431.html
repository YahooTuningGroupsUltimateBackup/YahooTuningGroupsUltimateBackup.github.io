Sorry you didn&apos;t get it that way.

If anything it sounds like we might be making the same point.&nbsp; Again, personally I don&apos;t mind if people &quot;go scientific&quot;, so long as they don&apos;t try to force everyone else down that path or demand that they &quot;humble-ize&quot; themselves or their efforts because they don&apos;t have X hundred pages of mathematical proof and cross referencing past theoreticians to prove their efforts as &quot;facts&quot;.&nbsp; If music was just absolute scientific &quot;fact&quot;...virtually no one would ever disagree about which artists, genres...count as &quot;real/good music&quot; (hint: that&apos;s never going to happen). :-D<br/>------------------------<br/>&nbsp; Another side note: I have long promoted the liberal use of alternative types of intervals near fifths (including &quot;minor sixths&quot; and &quot;diminished fifths&quot;) such as 14/9, 11/7, and 22/15.&nbsp; I had found those as &quot;good&quot; not by math, but by ear (IE math alone would hint that a 16/11 should sound better than a 22/15 and only an &quot;idiot&quot; would<br/> use a fifth other than 3/2).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Mike B&apos;s last recent tuning has very few good 3/2 fifths and mostly fifths between 14/9 and 11/7.&nbsp; Low and behold...when I used it, it seemed VERY easy to compose with, despite its &quot;criminal&quot; lack of near-perfect fifths.&nbsp; I even posted a sound example using a subset of MikeB&apos;s scale to this list...which virtually everyone ignored.&nbsp; The link is <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/9and7.mp3">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MichaelSheiman/9and7.mp3</a></p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2011 9:00:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
