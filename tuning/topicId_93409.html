I would use the<br/>built-in tuning functions of my synths.</p><p>scl and kbm are native Scala formats, tun is an older format<br/>that Scala supports.  IIRC, tun files contain a list of<br/>frequencies for all 128 notes on a MIDI channel.</p><p>scl files specify *intervals*, and these are tiled to consume<br/>all available MIDI note numbers (therefore the last interval<br/>in the file becomes the &quot;interval of equivalence&quot;).</p><p>I haven&apos;t worked with kbm but as the name suggests, they let<br/>you specify how the intervals in a scl file are mapped to<br/>a keyboard.</p><p>&gt; But it also seems like some synths can read .scl files, which<br/>&gt; is confusing. Does the mapping automatically happen linearly?</p><p>Yes, generally from middle C, which retains its A440/12-ET<br/>frequency.</p><p>&gt; And can .kbm files be combined with .scl files to create .tun<br/>&gt; files?</p><p>Scala may try to produce a tun for a given scl and kbm<br/>combination, since some synths only accept tun.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>PS- Does this mean you&apos;re sending the rebate thingy to Chris?<br/>&lt;pants with anticipation&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=93411 href="#93411">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2010 5:03:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh wow!
