But to me<br/>&gt;this list isn&apos;t *exclusively* about music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The example that comes immediately to mind is the ancient idea<br/>&gt;of the &apos;Music of the Spheres&apos;: the idea that relationships of<br/>&gt;orbital periods, distances, etc., between various heavenly bodies<br/>&gt;are in &apos;harmonic&apos; proportions.</p><p>No, but in so far as it&apos;s about tuning, it&apos;s about tuning as it relates to<br/>_music_, not the tuning of carburettors and not the &quot;tuning&quot; of planetary<br/>orbits, unless there is actually some relationship (as there is in your<br/>case) between the &quot;tuning&quot; of planetary orbits and musical tuning.</p><p>Keep watching, any day now we&apos;ll have the &apos;Music of the Carburettors&apos;. ;-)</p><p>Monz:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve been reading the discussion of various flavors of minor<br/>&gt;triad with interest, and just thought I&apos;d add that one which<br/>&gt;I really liked in a particular context was the 64:75:96 which<br/>&gt;I used at the climactic point in the melody of _3 Plus 4_:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/3plus4/3plus4ji.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/3plus4/3plus4ji.mid</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This chord makes its first appearance at 20 seconds into the tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(An mp3 version is available on the Tuning Punks site.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When I first uploaded this JI-retuned version at the very end<br/>&gt;of last year, I discussed this chord a bit on this list; check<br/>&gt;the archives.  The point I found most interesting was that<br/>&gt;75/64 is much closer in frequency to 7/6 than to 19/16 - both<br/>&gt;of which I tried first - but it sounds far more different (to my<br/>&gt;ears) from the former than from the latter.  I never did figure<br/>&gt;out how to explain that.</p><p>Are you claiming that 64:75:96 is a justly intoned chord? I don&apos;t think so.<br/>The reason it sounds more like 16:19:24 than 6:7:9 is because both 16:19:24<br/>and 64:75:96 are on the harmonic entropy plateau between the valley chords<br/>6:7:9 and 1/(6:5:4).</p><p>ratio      cents   diff(cents)<br/>----------------------------------<br/>6:7        266.9          valley<br/>                   7.7<br/>64:75      274.6<br/>                   9.0<br/>(5+6phi):  283.6          middle of plateau<br/>(6+7phi)          13.9<br/>16:19      297.5<br/>                  18.1<br/>5:6        315.6          valley</p><p>ratio      cents   diff(cents)<br/>----------------------------------<br/>4:5        386.3          valley<br/>                  18.1<br/>19:24      404.4<br/>                  18.0<br/>(4+7phi):  422.5          middle of plateau<br/>(5+9phi)           4.9<br/>75:96      427.4<br/>                   7.7<br/>7:9        435.1          valley</p><p>Margo Schulter:</p><p>&gt;Please let me begin by saying that I consider just intonation (JI) in<br/>&gt;the most comprehensive classic sense to mean exactly what David<br/>&gt;Beardsley has said: tuning by integer ratios.</p><p>I hope you can see, as David B has, that this definition is completely<br/>useless because, for example, it would count the Hammond organ [brilliant<br/>example Paul E] as JI when it clearly is not. One would only need to listen<br/>to it to be convinced of that.</p><p>From The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles.<br/>Just<br/>/Mus./ in /just interval/, etc. : Harmonically pure; sounding perfectly in<br/>tune 1811.</p><p>The important point is that whether or not an interval or chord is &apos;justly<br/>intoned&apos;, is not a mathematical property, it&apos;s about how something<br/>_sounds_! I find it ironic that I, a mathematical non-musician am telling a<br/>bunch of musicians this.</p><p>&gt;Of course, I also agree with Dave Keenan that there are different<br/>&gt;_kinds_ of JI intervals and styles, and that a ratio such as 3:2, for<br/>&gt;example, has a different kind of &quot;justness&quot; from a ratio of<br/>&gt;intermediate complexity such as 21:17, or one of impressive complexity<br/>&gt;such as 12544:9801 (81:64 plus two 896:891 commas).</p><p>No. 12544:9801 isn&apos;t any kind of JI interval. Not because it has large<br/>numbers in it, but because it isn&apos;t close enough to any ratio with small<br/>enough numbers. It might by accident be a consequence of some JI tuning,<br/>but there is no way it could be called a just interval. You only have to<br/>listen to it, and then try varying the pitch of one of the notes slightly<br/>in both directions to hear that there is nothing &quot;just&quot; about it.</p><p>&gt;Attempts to set some limit on the size of integer ratios used in JI<br/>&gt;seem to me both needlessly restrictive and futile, but certainly we<br/>&gt;can recognize the fact that more complex JI intervals have a quality<br/>&gt;much like those of tempered (irrational) ratios surrounding them; and<br/>&gt;similarly that some tempered intervals are &quot;virtually just.&quot;</p><p>If an interval &quot;has a quality much like those of tempered (irrational)<br/>ratios surrounding it&quot;, this is precisely what defines it as not just!</p><p>&gt;For example, when I tune 24-note Pythagorean or &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; (the<br/>&gt;latter term implying a neo-Gothic stylistic context), I certainly<br/>&gt;consider this a &quot;JI tuning,&quot; a description including all the ratios<br/>&gt;and intervals of the tuning, however simple (2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 9:8) or<br/>&gt;complex.</p><p>It may be a &quot;JI tuning&quot; (although most are not) but that does not make all<br/>the intervals it contains &quot;JI intervals&quot;.</p><p>&gt;At the same time, I recognize that the interval of 16 fifths up, for<br/>&gt;example, 43046721:33554432 (~431.28 cents), is &quot;just&quot; in the sense<br/>&gt;that it is an integer ratio derived from pure fifths, but from another<br/>&gt;point of view a &quot;virtually tempered&quot; approximation of 9:7, being<br/>&gt;around 3.80 cents narrow of this simple ratio.</p><p>The _only_ reason to consider 43046721:33554432 as just is because it is<br/>within 3.8 cents of 7:9. But it might better be called quasi just. 3.8<br/>cents is getting a little far away from such a complex ratio as 7:9.</p><p>&gt;The idea of &quot;tuning by integer ratios,&quot; of course, may carry various<br/>&gt;implications for various people and styles of music, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(1) Using the simplest and purest possible ratios for stable<br/>&gt;concords in a given style;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(2) Preferring epimores or superparticular ratios for intervals<br/>&gt;making up a tetrachord, for example (e.g. 9:8-8:7-28:27);<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(3) Seeking to maximize the simplicity or &quot;suavity&quot; of certain<br/>&gt;unstable intervals and combinations as well as stable ones,<br/>&gt;e.g. 4:5:6:7 in an 18th-century setting (Euler), or 7:9:12<br/>&gt;in a neo-14th-century setting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Possibly one might use capitalization to suggest a difference in<br/>&gt;nuance between a &quot;just&quot; interval (any integer ratio) and a Just<br/>&gt;interval (an interval with a _small_ integer ratio readily tuneable by<br/>&gt;ear by a locking in of partials).</p><p>No. This would be a complete departure from history. Motivated apparently<br/>by mathematics (or numerology) rather than art or aesthetics.</p><p>just = Just = pure = tuneable by ear</p><p>&gt;Also, JI systems feature what we might regard as three types of<br/>&gt;intervals:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(1) &quot;Simple&quot; JI intervals a la Dave Keenan, or the &quot;valleys&quot;<br/>&gt;of Paul Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy, where locking in of<br/>&gt;partials occurs, with Paul&apos;s suggested upper limit of<br/>&gt;complexity by the point for a ratio a:b where a*b=105.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(2) &quot;Intermediate&quot; JI intervals such as 14:11 or 13:11 where<br/>&gt;combination tones may give ratios something of a<br/>&gt;&quot;quasi-Just&quot; quality (I leave this as an open question).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(3) &quot;Complex&quot; JI intervals such as the regular Pythagorean<br/>&gt;major and minor thirds at 81:64 and 32:27, as well as<br/>&gt;a variety of large-integer ratios in more recent JI<br/>&gt;systems (e.g. LaMonte Young).</p><p>No. There is no comparison between 81:64 and 32:27 as typically used and<br/>LaMonte Young&apos;s massive sine-wave clusters. I can accept that the Dream<br/>House is a form of JI. It depends on extremely accurate tuning and uses a<br/>huge number of simultaneous tones to match its high ratios. It matters very<br/>much how accurately those tones are tuned. It matters very little how<br/>accurately 81:64 and 32:27 are tuned in Gothic music. 81:64 and 32:27 are<br/>not just intervals in this context.</p><p>&gt;A typical JI system may have some intervals from each of these three<br/>&gt;categories, which is to say that _some_ just intervals are also Just<br/>&gt;or &quot;pure.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I _just_ can&apos;t accept that definition.

But I think Margo<br/>made<br/>some very strong points.  I like her suggested trio of just interval<br/>types, though it may need some terminological refinement.  Maybe<br/>they&apos;re not types of just intervals but only types of intervals<br/>arising from Just tuning systems.  (We do need to be careful not to<br/>be<br/>inclusive to the point of making terms meaningless.)  But I find them<br/>to be helpful categories, especially in light of her neo-Gothic<br/>theoretical treatises.</p><p>Between her and Dave K., I&apos;m wondering whether we need a new term<br/>(Oh, no!  Not again! }:- ).  How should we categorize an interval<br/>that<br/>is a consequence of a JI tuning, yet sounds like a tempered interval?<br/> How can it be called a tempered interval if both of its tones are<br/>members of a JI tuning?  If it&apos;s neither tempered nor just, what is<br/>it?  &quot;Rational&quot; comes to mind, but it&apos;s a bit broad.</p><p>This is similar to the issue of 4+ digit ETs, which I lampooned<br/>recently.  Some people might have thought I was making fun of Paul E.<br/> That was not the case.  The idea of such large ETs conjured up some<br/>very strange images in my mind and I just couldn&apos;t resist sharing<br/>them.  But clearly, there is a sound(!) theoretical reason to speak<br/>of an eight thousand some-odd ET, even though there is no practical<br/>musical use for an instrument with tens of thousands of notes, nor<br/>for one with intervals of tiny fractions of a cent between adjacent<br/>tones.</p><p>Similarly, there is good reason, in the right theoretical tuning<br/>context, to speak of high-term rational intervals, even when they are<br/>audibly indistinguishable from certain irrational intervals and/or<br/>lower term rational intervals.  They are demanded by some consistent<br/>rational systems, while the intervals they sound like are explicitly<br/>excluded.  As Joe Monzo cleverly reminds us, all roads lead to n^0.<br/>But you still have to choose a road.</p><p>When David Beardsley recently spoke of boldly using higher members of<br/>the harmonic series, I couldn&apos;t see at first how it could require<br/>courage to do so.  But in a sense he&apos;s right.  The higher you go, the<br/>greater danger that your audience will get lost in the harmonic<br/>terrain.  It&apos;s good to know where the pitfalls lie but I&apos;m not sure<br/>it&apos;s possible to predict with certainty the exact point of no return.<br/> A great composer may be able to keep listeners well oriented by any<br/>number of means.

Which can<br/>best be put as a question: Is the microtonal music we make &quot;tuning<br/>theory&quot; (or the realization thereof), or is it &quot;music&quot;. Ultimately,<br/>and most importantly, I believe it&apos;s the latter that must always take<br/>precedence. Microtonal tuning theory does not good music make. And<br/>one must face a huge &quot;alienation factor&quot; with the consumer of this<br/>kind of niche market, when the focus is on the theory.</p><p>When I did the first draft of the liner notes for my<br/>CD &quot;Metamorphose&quot;, I didn&apos;t even mention the tuning system(s)<br/>employed. I noticed that Kraig Grady also mentions little about his<br/>tunings in his CDs. I wouldn&apos;t attempt to speak for Kraig&apos;s purposes,<br/>but for myself, I just know that to get folks to appreciate this<br/>music, it can be crucial to consider the packaging as well as the<br/>content.</p><p>What do you put forth with microtonal music that draws in the<br/>uninitiated? It&apos;s an important question to ask in the face of many<br/>cultural facts, such as: symphonies disbanding for lack of support,<br/>high school music programs being discontinued, classical music<br/>concert and CD sales at an all time low, and the ever deeper<br/>entrenchment of the big conglomo &quot;content controlling&quot; major record<br/>labels, who have such a power grip on the airwaves; distributing<br/>their own brand of &quot;audio valium&quot; - this is happening all over the<br/>country. What do microtonal composers have to contribute in these<br/>changing times? Part of the answer for me is beautiful music. When I<br/>play a Kraig Grady CD, I&apos;m not concerned with fondling the packaging,<br/>I&apos;m swept away by the breathtaking solos (Santur? Mt.Meru! - goose<br/>pimples every time!), and ensemble compositions - which really<br/>require little explanation, because the music&apos;s communicating it&apos;s<br/>intention without the programmatic notes. Even looking from this side<br/>of the fence, I&apos;m listening for the music to be good - to have some<br/>kind of compelling quality that will make me want to hear it again<br/>and again - and I become more interested in the theory later. I<br/>believe it&apos;s important to consider that most folks listen to music on<br/>a purely emotional level. Considering this, what foot should one put<br/>forward? The math or the music? Perhaps there&apos;s a balance one must<br/>strike between the two. I think we all would like to see the level of<br/>cultural assimilation of microtonality that would allow the theory to<br/>disappear into the background of our musical culture, in the manner<br/>that we&apos;ve assimilated our current 12 tET, but we face a difficult<br/>reality.</p><p>Can I get an Amen-a-?</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=15871 href="#15871">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2000 12:31:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:ligonj@northstate.net">ligonj@northstate.net</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; believe it&apos;s important to consider that most folks listen to music on<br/>&gt; a purely emotional level.</p><p>That&apos;s right.

In this case, all the notes of the scale are related by<br/>factors of 3/2, 6/5, or 7/5 to other notes in the scale. Besides the 63/50,<br/>this scale contains a 112/75, which is less than 8 cents (224/225) away<br/>from 3/2. It certainly seems reasonable to call the 112/75 a tempered 3/2,<br/>even though it resulted from the combination of simple 7-limit intervals.<br/>The 63/50 is a little more problematic, since it&apos;s not really a very good<br/>approximation to 5/4, but since it&apos;s only a 12-note tuning, I think it<br/>would be perceived as a temered 5/4. In a larger 7-limit tuning, the<br/>126/125 difference between 5/4 and 63/50 might be significant enough to<br/>consider them as distinct intervals.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=15883 href="#15883">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2000 9:25:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;xouoxno@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Only because you can&apos;t find a pattern.

But<br/>in</p><p>the context of a tuning and compositional style that excludes<br/>5-limit</p><p>functions, 8192/6561 may function instead as the pure 3:2 below</p><p>4096/2187.  This is where the scale member 8192/6561 is different<br/>from</p><p>the interval 8192:6561.  In that case, I think it is a just interval</p><p>in its own right.  But, wishing to respect the viewpoints of others</p><p>(and recognizing the fallibility of my own), I ask whether we might</p><p>refine our terminology to reflect this possibility.  IOW, have</p><p>separate terms for each of Margo&apos;s three categories of &quot;just&quot;</p><p>intervals.</p><p>&gt; Even though 63/50 isn&apos;t in itself a simple ratio that can be tuned<br/>&gt; accurately by ear or heard as consonant (except as a distant</p><p>approximation<br/>&gt; of 5/4), it can easily turn up in a 7-limit scale. I ran across it</p><p>in a<br/>&gt; 12-note 7-limit scale that I&apos;ve been playing with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 21/20 9/8 6/5 63/50 4/3 7/5 3/2 63/40 42/25 9/5 189/100 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if I ran across it in the following scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 89/84 55/49 44/37 63/50 4/3 99/70 3/2 73/46 37/22 98/55 17/9 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d conclude that it was meant to be a tempered interval. This</p><p>seemingly<br/>&gt; haphazard set of pitches is in fact a good approximation of 12-TET.</p><p>Great examples!  This is exactly what I was saying (or meant to<br/>say!)</p><p>about the Hammond tuning (see</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15861">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15861</a>).  Haphazard rational</p><p>tunings are not JI, except, of course, by accident.  To state this</p><p>from the other side of the coin, JI depends as much on systematic</p><p>organization of the pitch continuum as on the use of ratios, IMHO.<br/>Is</p><p>this an appropriate refinement of the definition of JI, or am I</p><p>stretching it too far?</p><p>&gt; So the question is what to call 63/50 in that 7-limit JI scale I was<br/>&gt; talking about. In this case, all the notes of the scale are related</p><p>by<br/>&gt; factors of 3/2, 6/5, or 7/5 to other notes in the scale.</p><p>For that reason, I would call 63/50 a just interval in this context,</p><p>with the caveat that it could easily be used as 5/4 in a composition</p><p>using this tuning if the composer were not careful.  Or a composer<br/>may</p><p>wish to blur the line to artistic effect (the &quot;confusion&quot; in my<br/>reply</p><p>to David Beardsely <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15897">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15897</a>).</p><p>&gt; The 63/50 is a little more problematic, since it&apos;s not really a very</p><p>good<br/>&gt; approximation to 5/4, but since it&apos;s only a 12-note tuning, I think</p><p>it<br/>&gt; would be perceived as a temered 5/4. In a larger 7-limit tuning, the<br/>&gt; 126/125 difference between 5/4 and 63/50 might be significant enough</p><p>to<br/>&gt; consider them as distinct intervals.</p><p>Did somebody say &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;?  But a composer might keep the</p><p>harmonic identity clear by being careful to play the 63/50 only in<br/>its</p><p>3:2, 6:5, and/or 7:5 relationships to other members of the scale,<br/>and</p><p>not to do such things as invoke the triad 1/1 63/50 3/2, which will</p><p>almost certainly be heard as a tempered 4:5:6 chord for all intents</p><p>and purposes.

I wrote it in a hurry as I was going away for a few days and<br/>it was in response to posts that were already many days old. My apologies.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>Non-just intervals in Just tunings<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Several people have expounded on one of the distinctions that Margo made.<br/>High integer ratios that arise by chaining low ones versus the low ones<br/>themselves. I agreed with the distinction. In fact I thought it was<br/>obvious. But I could not agree with the terminology Margo proposed.</p><p>One reason I could never accept Margo&apos;s suggestion to call these big &quot;J&quot;<br/>Just and little &quot;j&quot; just is because I (and others) already use big &quot;J&quot; to<br/>to distinguish it from little &quot;j&quot; meaning &quot;merely&quot; [at least that&apos;s why<br/>_I_ do it Carl, although I don&apos;t disagree with your reason].</p><p>Justness is indeed intransitive [Thanks Robert Walker]. Take a Just<br/>diminished triad B:D:F where B:D and D:F are both tuned 5:6. Merely because<br/>B:D is just and D:F is just, doesn&apos;t mean that B:F is just. 25:36 is not<br/>something anyone could tune by ear with ordinary timbres. However it makes<br/>perfect sense to refer to the whole chord as just, because there is no<br/>remaining freedom to justly intone the B:F independently of the B:D and<br/>D:F. The same goes for whether or not to call a scale or tuning just.</p><p>The fact that the B:F tuning is a medium integer ratio is entirely<br/>incidental. Dave Finamore, I should have written &quot;incidental&quot; when I wrote<br/>&quot;accidental&quot;.</p><p>We usually have two types of interval in a Just tuning: Just intervals and<br/>non-just intervals. A non-just interval isn&apos;t necessarily a tempered<br/>interval, since &quot;tempered&quot; implies a deliberate attempt to compromise. The<br/>25:36 above is the result of a complete refusal to compromise on the two<br/>5:6&apos;s, but it still isn&apos;t a Just interval (although it might be in the<br/>context of a 25:27:30:33:36 chord). A tempered diminished chord might take<br/>account of the proximity of 25:36 to 5:7 or 7:10.</p><p>So I don&apos;t see a need for a new term, unless you count &quot;non-just&quot; as new.<br/>They are simply non-just intervals that occur in just tunings. I realise<br/>though that I have often, in the past, overloaded the terms consonance and<br/>dissonance for this purpose. As Dave Beardsley pointed out, an 8:13 (or<br/>even an 8:15?) might be justly intoned, but you&apos;d hardly call them<br/>consonances.</p><p>Dave Finnamore, I fail to understand how the Hammond organ tuning is not an<br/>&quot;organizing [of] pitches into a system for the purpose of aiding the<br/>theorist, composer, and listener in discovering meaning in (or imposing<br/>meaning on) the pitch continuum.&quot; It fails to be a JI tuning by failing to<br/>be JI, not by failing to be a tuning. Whereas your collection of 13 limit<br/>just intervals fails to be a tuning because there is nothing to relate them<br/>to each other. Unless you mean them to be stacked on top of each other in<br/>the order given, in which case it is a tuning, but it stands or falls as JI<br/>on whether 10:13 can be tuned by ear or not (which I severely doubt). In<br/>any case it isn&apos;t useful or interesting, but that&apos;s not what I&apos;m trying to<br/>define.</p><p>The Hammond pitch ratios all relate to a common 1/1 at 320 Hz. It clearly<br/>is a tuning (by any definition of tuning that I am aware of). The fact that<br/>the 1/1 is not included in the tuning does not disqualify it from being JI;<br/>witness Wilson&apos;s CPS&apos;s. What disqualifies it is the fact that the just<br/>intervals that it _does_ contain (octaves), have not locked it up<br/>completely. Other intervals could be justly intoned without making any of<br/>the existing just intervals non-just.</p><p>A Pythagorean tuning with Just octaves and fifths is JI because it is fully<br/>committed or locked up. One must back-track and break one or more of the<br/>just fifths before one can go forward again to say a 5-limit JI tuning.</p><p>Monz, you haven&apos;t told me why you think 64:75:96 is justly intoned. I&apos;ll<br/>tell you why I think it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s not because the numbers are too big.<br/>It&apos;s because I set up my synth with unadorned sawtooth waves, split the<br/>keyboard and transposed the low part up an octave, played the middle note<br/>on the low half so I could move it, and only it, around with the pitch bend<br/>joystick, and found absolutely nothing that could distinguish the 64:75:96<br/>from other pitches in the general vicinity. I could easily find the justly<br/>intoned 6:7:9 and 1/(6:5:4). I had to have it pretty loud and listen pretty<br/>carefully before I could find anything that _might_ be the 16:19:24 (or was<br/>it an approximate 11:13|11:14?). But absolutely nothing special happens at<br/>64:75:96. So how can you say it is justly intoned? Maybe you were afraid I<br/>would say your piece was not JI because it contained one non-just chord. I<br/>hope it is clear that is not the case.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>Just not small integer - small integer not just<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>I think that any tuning that has as many as possible of its intervals<br/>(dyads) resulting in coincidence of partials, is a just tuning (or JI<br/>tuning), even when it only has that property for some particular inharmonic<br/>timbre (a la Sethares). In that case we need to say that the tuning is<br/>&quot;Just for timbre x&quot;. This is a case where a Just tuning has absolutely<br/>nothing to do with integer ratios, small, large or otherwise.</p><p>When we say a tuning is Just without qualification, we mean it is Just for<br/>typical harmonic timbres. But a tuning that is Just for harmonic timbres<br/>will also be Just for inharmonic timbres and sine waves, not because of<br/>coinciding partials, but because of the periodicity effect or the &quot;harmonic<br/>series template&quot; in the brain.</p><p>The Hammond organ tuning is an example of a non-just tuning that uses<br/>precise medium integer ratios (no integer greater than 85). A Setharian<br/>inharmonic spectrum scale is an example of a Just tuning that doesn&apos;t use<br/>integer ratios at all. So &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;limited-integer-ratio&quot; are categories<br/>that significantly overlap, but neither is wholly contained in the other.</p><p>Dave Beardsley, the Hammond organ tuning is not a poorly-tuned 12-tET at<br/>all. One would not find many 12-tET acoustic instruments (or JI acoustic<br/>instruments for that matter) tuned so accurately as to have errors less<br/>than 1 cent in all intervals.</p><p>------------------------------------<br/>&quot;Rational tuning&quot; considered useless<br/>------------------------------------</p><p>If &quot;rational tuning&quot; means &quot;a tuning based on ratios&quot;, I hope we can see<br/>that this is a purely mathematical property and has no relationship to any<br/>audible quality of a tuning, or the intervals or chords available in it.<br/>One cannot tell by listening, or even by measuring with the most<br/>sophisticated instruments possible, whether a tuning is rational or not.<br/>That distinction belongs only to the platonic realm of pure mathemtics. In<br/>the &quot;real&quot; world no frequency ratio can ever be said to be rational or<br/>irrational. It would take an infinite time of counting cycles before one<br/>could decide.</p><p>As such, I find the concept of rational tuning to be of no interest<br/>whatsoever. Limited-integer-rational is of interest, but does not<br/>correspond to Just.</p><p>Incidentally, for me a &quot;scale&quot; is primarily a melodic entity, a tuning may<br/>support many scales or a tuning may be a tuning of a single interval or<br/>chord. But &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;tuning&quot; are often used interchangeably and that&apos;s<br/>ok. Does anyone have other distinctions between scale and tuning?</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>How does context affect justness?<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>Dan Stearns, I can accept that some aspects of musical context, e.g. timbre<br/>and harmonic context, can make a difference as to whether some medium<br/>integer ratio interval is considered justly intoned. The test is still<br/>whether listeners can tell when you vary its tuning by a few cents in that<br/>context. I don&apos;t accept that an otherwise non-just interval can become Just<br/>merely by playing it for a very short time. I think it is understood that<br/>there is some lower limit on the duration of the listening test, of the<br/>order of a second, or the maximum decay time of the instrument.</p><p>But I certainly can&apos;t accept that anyone&apos;s _intention_ (performer, composer<br/>or scale creator) can make a difference to whether or not an interval is<br/>justly intoned. Give me an example where you think it should.</p><p>Rest assured that I do not think Happy Birthday played in octaves on a<br/>12-tET instrument qualifies as JI music. Of course every vertical interval<br/>played is justly intoned, but the underlying scale is not, because it has<br/>freedom to justly intone many other intervals that it does not. But I&apos;m not<br/>currently trying to improve our definition of &quot;JI music&quot;, but only &quot;JI<br/>tuning&quot; (and hence Just scale, Just chord, Just interval).

True.  I didn&apos;t say it failed to be a tuning.  It fails to be the<br/>tuning it intends to approximate, though not by enough to matter.<br/>But I didn&apos;t say that either.</p><p>&gt; Whereas your collection of 13 limit<br/>&gt; just intervals fails to be a tuning because there is nothing to<br/>relate them<br/>&gt; to each other.</p><p>Exactly.  That was the essence of my point.  Now here we reach the<br/>crux of the matter:</p><p>&gt; but it stands or falls as JI<br/>&gt; on whether 10:13 can be tuned by ear or not (which I severely<br/>doubt).<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; Monz, you haven&apos;t told me why you think 64:75:96 is justly intoned.<br/>I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; tell you why I think it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s not because the numbers are too<br/>big.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s because I [snip] found absolutely nothing that could<br/>distinguish the 64:75:96<br/>&gt; from other pitches in the general vicinity.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; If &quot;rational tuning&quot; means &quot;a tuning based on ratios&quot;, I hope we<br/>can see<br/>&gt; that this is a purely mathematical property and has no relationship<br/>to any<br/>&gt; audible quality of a tuning, or the intervals or chords available<br/>in it.<br/>&gt; One cannot tell by listening, or even by measuring with the most<br/>&gt; sophisticated instruments possible, whether a tuning is rational or<br/>not.<br/>&gt; That distinction belongs only to the platonic realm of pure<br/>mathemtics. In<br/>&gt; the &quot;real&quot; world no frequency ratio can ever be said to be rational<br/>or<br/>&gt; irrational. It would take an infinite time of counting cycles<br/>before one<br/>&gt; could decide.<br/>[Good point!] [snip]<br/>&gt; The test is still<br/>&gt; whether listeners can tell when you vary its tuning by a few cents<br/>in that<br/>&gt; context.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; I still maintain that the Justness of an interval is primarily<br/>determined<br/>&gt; by listening while a pitch is varied slightly one way and the<br/>other. There<br/>&gt; is a gray area, but many intervals are clearly just or non-just by<br/>this<br/>&gt; criterion.</p><p>Of course!  Why didn&apos;t I see this before?  This is the old Aristotle<br/>vs. Plato argument.  This is a matter which hasn&apos;t been solved in<br/>2600 years, and we&apos;re not likely to solve in on the Tuning List!  LOL.</p><p>But my main problem with making the question &quot;Can it be tuned by<br/>ear?&quot;<br/>the main criterion is that it&apos;s not possible to define at precicely<br/>what point intervals become untunable by ear.  You have a definition<br/>of &quot;just&quot; that varies from person to person, from time to time, from<br/>place to place, from instrument to instrument - in short an<br/>unreliable<br/>definition, and therefore one which can have no universal application.</p><p>My step-grandfather probably couldn&apos;t have tuned 2:1 properly on a<br/>pair of strings, never mind 5:4; he couldn&apos;t carry a tune in a<br/>proverbial bucket.  In college, as a music major, I would almost<br/>certainly have tuned a major third much closer to 400 cents than to<br/>5:4, even as a singer in a barbershop quartet.  I can now tune 11:4<br/>quite reliably by ear using stable, harmonic timbres, something I<br/>could not have done two years ago.  Yet last week, while recording a<br/>piece with multiple diatonic pennywhistle parts, I had a great deal<br/>of trouble telling whether certain passages were sharp or flat to<br/>each<br/>other.  Very disconcerting.  One thing I noticed, though not for the<br/>first time, is that tuning can sound radically different on<br/>headphones than through speakers.</p><p>I know you will probably never agree with me that terms like &quot;JI&quot;<br/>need a platonic definition, and I will not likely concede that they<br/>need a practical one.

I&apos;ll tell you why I think it isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not because the numbers are too big.  It&apos;s because<br/>&gt; I set up my synth with unadorned sawtooth waves, split<br/>&gt; the keyboard and transposed the low part up an octave,<br/>&gt; played the middle note on the low half so I could move<br/>&gt; it, and only it, around with the pitch bend joystick,<br/>&gt; and found absolutely nothing that could distinguish<br/>&gt; the 64:75:96 from other pitches in the general vicinity.<br/>&gt; I could easily find the justly intoned 6:7:9 and<br/>&gt; 1/(6:5:4). I had to have it pretty loud and listen<br/>&gt; pretty carefully before I could find anything that<br/>&gt; _might_ be the 16:19:24 (or was it an approximate<br/>&gt; 11:13|11:14?). But absolutely nothing special happens<br/>&gt; at 64:75:96. So how can you say it is justly intoned?<br/>&gt; Maybe you were afraid I would say your piece was not<br/>&gt; JI because it contained one non-just chord. I hope<br/>&gt; it is clear that is not the case.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dave, I&apos;m glad you took all the trouble to create a<br/>listening experiment in order to make a more perceptive<br/>observation about this discussion.  Beyond the three<br/>tunings I tried for this chord when retuning the piece<br/>from 12-tET, I haven&apos;t gone into this kind of depth on<br/>this question.  Perhaps an elaboration on my methods<br/>and reasons for choosing 64:75:96 as the tuning for<br/>this triad would be illuminating.</p><p>Of course the two outer pitches of the triad are simply<br/>a 2:3 ratio.  That part was easy.  The trial-and-error<br/>concerned only the tuning of the middle note.</p><p>I must admit that I chose 64:75 because I was thinking<br/>in terms of 5-limit when searching for the right tuning<br/>of the &apos;minor 3rd&apos;.  Certainly I could have found other,<br/>higher-prime- or -odd-limit ratios which are very close<br/>in pitch to 64:75 and which would have worked, but I<br/>simply didn&apos;t try them.</p><p>The retuning of this chord began with the knowledge<br/>that I wanted a &apos;darker&apos; sound for this chord than<br/>the one provided by the 12-tET version of the minor<br/>triad.</p><p>I tried 6:7 for the &apos;minor 3rd&apos; first, and while<br/>*harmonically* it gave me the &apos;dark&apos; quality I was<br/>looking for for this particular chord, I didn&apos;t like<br/>the way it sounded in the context of the piece, mainly<br/>because it seemed to be out-of-tune with the pitches<br/>in the preceding chord, and &apos;pain&apos; in the melodic<br/>movement disturbed me.  This triad gives a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;<br/>on the bottom of 6:7 = ~267 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos;<br/>on top of 7:9 = ~435 cents.</p><p>So next I tried 16:19.  This seemed melodically<br/>smoother but gave a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; which was too wide<br/>to give me the &apos;dark&apos; harmonic quality I was seeking;<br/>in short, it resembled the 12-tET version too much.<br/>This triad gives a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; of 16:19 = ~298 cents<br/>and a &apos;major 3rd&apos; of 19:24 = ~404 cents.</p><p>So, knowing that 64:75 was pretty close in size to the<br/>discarded 6:7, I gave it a shot, and bingo!, it gave<br/>exactly the sound I was looking for: the &apos;dark&apos; harmonic<br/>quality without the melodic &apos;pain&apos;.  This triad gives a<br/>&apos;minor 3rd&apos; of 64:75 = ~275 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos;<br/>of 25:32 = ~427 cents.</p><p>Now, to analyze some other options:</p><p>The triad you notate as 11:13|11:14 is 13-prime-limit<br/>and can also be rendered as an otonal proportion by<br/>the numbers 121:143:182.  These ratios are indeed rather<br/>close in pitch to the ones I chose, and perhaps would<br/>have worked just as well for me, and at the same time<br/>given lower-integer ratios between the chord-members.<br/>This triad contains a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; on the bottom of<br/>11:13 = ~289 cents, and a &apos;major 3rd&apos; on top of<br/>11:14 = ~418 cents.</p><p>The 17-prime-limit triad 34:40:51 would have been a good<br/>medium-integer possibility which I would expect would sound<br/>even more like my choice, giving a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; on the<br/>bottom of 17:20 = ~281 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos; on top<br/>of 40:51 = ~421 cents.</p><p>The 23-prime-limit triad 46:54:69 is yet another<br/>possibility, closer still in pitch to my choice, and<br/>giving a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; of 23:27 = ~278 cents and a<br/>&apos;major 3rd&apos; of 18:23 = ~424 cents.</p><p>Of course, with the numbers getting this high, I<br/>could have also given 54:64:81 a go - a regular old<br/>3-limit (= Pythagorean) &apos;minor triad&apos; with a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;<br/>of 27:32 = ~294 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos; of 64:81<br/>= ~408 cents.  Most likely this would have sounded<br/>pretty similar to my discarded 16:19:24 version.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Just not small integer - small integer not just<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that any tuning that has as many as possible<br/>&gt; of its intervals (dyads) resulting in coincidence<br/>&gt; of partials, is a just tuning (or JI tuning), even<br/>&gt; when it only has that property for some particular<br/>&gt; inharmonic timbre (a la Sethares). In that case we<br/>&gt; need to say that the tuning is &quot;Just for timbre x&quot;.<br/>&gt; This is a case where a Just tuning has absolutely<br/>&gt; nothing to do with integer ratios, small, large or<br/>&gt; otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When we say a tuning is Just without qualification,<br/>&gt; we mean it is Just for typical harmonic timbres.<br/>&gt; But a tuning that is Just for harmonic timbres will<br/>&gt; also be Just for inharmonic timbres and sine waves,<br/>&gt; not because of coinciding partials, but because of<br/>&gt; the periodicity effect or the &quot;harmonic series<br/>&gt; template&quot; in the brain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Hammond organ tuning is an example of a non-just<br/>&gt; tuning that uses precise medium integer ratios (no<br/>&gt; integer greater than 85).

This<br/>&gt; &gt; retuned version of _3 Plus 4_ was most definitely meant to be<br/>&gt; &gt; a &apos;JI&apos; version, and all of the other chords I use in this tune<br/>&gt; &gt; have much simpler proportions.  I simply wanted a particular<br/>&gt; &gt; sound at this particular point in the tune which (to my ears)<br/>&gt; &gt; demanded this particular tuning.  The overall context of the<br/>&gt; &gt; whole tune, in this version, is definitely JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But _that chord_ isn&apos;t audibly different from a non-JI chord,<br/>&gt; whatever the context . . .</p><p>While I have to agree with that statement, Paul, I still<br/>think that context plays a very important part in whether<br/>or not one *audibly recognizes* something to be in JI tuning.</p><p>When I listen to this piece, in this tuning, this particular<br/>chord defninitely sounds different from a 12-tET chord to me:<br/>the narrowness of the 64:75 &apos;minor 3rd&apos; (= ~275 cents)<br/>is quite distinctive.  Of course, that&apos;s not to say that<br/>it doesn&apos;t resemble many other non-JI chords.  Maybe it&apos;s<br/>the case that my mind refuses to accept it as anything other<br/>than JI, simply because I know that 64:75 is a 5-limit ratio<br/>and I know how it fits into the 5-limit lattice, and my<br/>foreknowledge affects my perception.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Certainly, the numbers in the proportions of this one chord<br/>&gt; &gt; happen to be much larger than the numbers in the proportions<br/>&gt; &gt; of all the other chords, but that (IMO) does not invalidate<br/>&gt; &gt; the &apos;JI-ness&apos; of this one chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How do you feel about the Hammond organ, then?</p><p>I would say that the Hammond organ tuning is so close to<br/>12-tET that it doesn&apos;t approximate any JI tuning well enough<br/>to imply JI.

I almost always treat both of these intervals<br/>as consonances in my JI pieces, and find that as chord<br/>members they help to produce beautiful chords that I<br/>think of as &apos;consonant&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Monz, you haven&apos;t told me why you think 64:75:96 is<br/>&gt; justly intoned. I&apos;ll tell you why I think it isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not because the numbers are too big.  It&apos;s because<br/>&gt; I set up my synth with unadorned sawtooth waves, split<br/>&gt; the keyboard and transposed the low part up an octave,<br/>&gt; played the middle note on the low half so I could move<br/>&gt; it, and only it, around with the pitch bend joystick,<br/>&gt; and found absolutely nothing that could distinguish<br/>&gt; the 64:75:96 from other pitches in the general vicinity.<br/>&gt; I could easily find the justly intoned 6:7:9 and<br/>&gt; 1/(6:5:4). I had to have it pretty loud and listen<br/>&gt; pretty carefully before I could find anything that<br/>&gt; _might_ be the 16:19:24 (or was it an approximate<br/>&gt; 11:13|11:14?). But absolutely nothing special happens<br/>&gt; at 64:75:96. So how can you say it is justly intoned?<br/>&gt; Maybe you were afraid I would say your piece was not<br/>&gt; JI because it contained one non-just chord. I hope<br/>&gt; it is clear that is not the case.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dave, I&apos;m glad you took all the trouble to create a<br/>listening experiment in order to make a more perceptive<br/>observation about this discussion.  Beyond the three<br/>tunings I tried for this chord when retuning the piece<br/>from 12-tET, I haven&apos;t gone into this kind of depth on<br/>this question.  Perhaps an elaboration on my methods<br/>and reasons for choosing 64:75:96 as the tuning for<br/>this triad would be illuminating.</p><p>Of course the two outer pitches of the triad are simply<br/>a 2:3 ratio.  That part was easy.  The trial-and-error<br/>concerned only the tuning of the middle note.</p><p>I must admit that I chose 64:75 because I was thinking<br/>in terms of 5-limit when searching for the right tuning<br/>of the &apos;minor 3rd&apos;.  Certainly I could have found other,<br/>higher-prime- or -odd-limit ratios which are very close<br/>in pitch to 64:75 and which would have worked, but I<br/>simply didn&apos;t try them.</p><p>The retuning of this chord began with the knowledge<br/>that I wanted a &apos;darker&apos; sound for this chord than<br/>the one provided by the 12-tET version of the minor<br/>triad.</p><p>I tried 6:7 for the &apos;minor 3rd&apos; first, and while<br/>*harmonically* it gave me the &apos;dark&apos; quality I was<br/>looking for for this particular chord, I didn&apos;t like<br/>the way it sounded in the context of the piece, mainly<br/>because it seemed to be out-of-tune with the pitches<br/>in the preceding chord, and &apos;pain&apos; in the melodic<br/>movement disturbed me.  This triad gives a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;<br/>on the bottom of 6:7 = ~267 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos;<br/>on top of 7:9 = ~435 cents.</p><p>So next I tried 16:19.  This seemed melodically<br/>smoother but gave a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; which was too wide<br/>to give me the &apos;dark&apos; harmonic quality I was seeking;<br/>in short, it resembled the 12-tET version too much.<br/>This triad gives a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; of 16:19 = ~298 cents<br/>and a &apos;major 3rd&apos; of 19:24 = ~404 cents.</p><p>So, knowing that 64:75 was pretty close in size to the<br/>discarded 6:7, I gave it a shot, and bingo!, it gave<br/>exactly the sound I was looking for: the &apos;dark&apos; harmonic<br/>quality without the melodic &apos;pain&apos;.  This triad gives a<br/>&apos;minor 3rd&apos; of 64:75 = ~275 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos;<br/>of 25:32 = ~427 cents.</p><p>Now, to analyze some other options:</p><p>The triad you notate as 11:13|11:14 is 13-prime-limit<br/>and can also be rendered as an otonal proportion by<br/>the numbers 121:143:182.  These ratios are indeed rather<br/>close in pitch to the ones I chose, and perhaps would<br/>have worked just as well for me, and at the same time<br/>given lower-integer ratios between the chord-members.<br/>This triad contains a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; on the bottom of<br/>11:13 = ~289 cents, and a &apos;major 3rd&apos; on top of<br/>11:14 = ~418 cents.</p><p>The 17-prime-limit triad 34:40:51 would have been a<br/>good medium-integer possibility which I would expect<br/>sound even more like my choice, giving a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;<br/>on the bottom of 17:20 = ~281 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos;<br/>on top of 40:51 = ~421 cents.</p><p>The 23-prime-limit triad 46:54:69 is yet another<br/>possibility, closer still in pitch to my choice, and<br/>giving a &apos;minor 3rd&apos; of 23:27 = ~278 cents and a<br/>&apos;major 3rd&apos; of 18:23 = ~424 cents.</p><p>Of course, with the numbers getting this high, I<br/>could have also given 54:64:81 a go - a regular old<br/>3-limit (= Pythagorean) &apos;minor triad&apos; with a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;<br/>of 27:32 = ~294 cents and a &apos;major 3rd&apos; of 64:81<br/>= ~408 cents.  Most likely this would have sounded<br/>pretty similar to my discarded 16:19:24 version.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Just not small integer - small integer not just<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that any tuning that has as many as possible<br/>&gt; of its intervals (dyads) resulting in coincidence<br/>&gt; of partials, is a just tuning (or JI tuning), even<br/>&gt; when it only has that property for some particular<br/>&gt; inharmonic timbre (a la Sethares). In that case we<br/>&gt; need to say that the tuning is &quot;Just for timbre x&quot;.<br/>&gt; This is a case where a Just tuning has absolutely<br/>&gt; nothing to do with integer ratios, small, large or<br/>&gt; otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When we say a tuning is Just without qualification,<br/>&gt; we mean it is Just for typical harmonic timbres.<br/>&gt; But a tuning that is Just for harmonic timbres will<br/>&gt; also be Just for inharmonic timbres and sine waves,<br/>&gt; not because of coinciding partials, but because of<br/>&gt; the periodicity effect or the &quot;harmonic series<br/>&gt; template&quot; in the brain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Hammond organ tuning is an example of a non-just<br/>&gt; tuning that uses precise medium integer ratios (no<br/>&gt; integer greater than 85). A Setharian inharmonic<br/>&gt; spectrum scale is an example of a Just tuning that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t use integer ratios at all. So &quot;Just&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;limited-integer-ratio&quot; are categories that<br/>&gt; significantly overlap, but neither is wholly<br/>&gt; contained in the other.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dave, I think this is a terrific way of making the<br/>kinds of distinctions I like to keep in mind.</p><p>On the one hand, it seems to me that the only way<br/>one could create a definitive statement as to<br/>whether a piece is JI or not is to determine<br/>whether or not it *sounds* like it makes use<br/>of &apos;purely tuned&apos; intervals.

And I see that I didn&apos;t use the<br/>&gt;convention the way I understand it.  As I meant to show the ratios of<br/>&gt;a tuning, each to 1/1, I should have written it as 8/5 5/3 etc.,<br/>&gt;right?</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But regarding your point, &apos;is the tuning just&apos;... I would say that<br/>&gt;&gt;no tuning is just.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That&apos;s an interesting point of view.  Then what do you call tunings<br/>&gt;composed of rational intervals?  Especially those intended to provide<br/>&gt;maximal just intonation of individual intervals?</p><p>I guess the key is wether we consider a &quot;tuning&quot; to be a list of<br/>numbers only, or a list of numbers with intent.  If the latter, &quot;just<br/>tunings&quot; (as opposed to &quot;tempered tunings&quot;) might be a good answer... if<br/>the former, &quot;rational tunings&quot; (vs. &quot;irrational tunings&quot;) is probably<br/>best.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Why is just often written with an upper-case &quot;j&quot; on this list?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Someone (Margo?) recently proposed guidelines for when to capitalize<br/>&gt;it.  I go by gut instinct, but my supposed guideline is, if I&apos;m using<br/>&gt;it in a name (e.g., &quot;this piece is in Just Intonation&quot;) I capitalize<br/>&gt;it.  Otherwise (e.g., &quot;the players used just intonation&quot;) I don&apos;t.<br/>&gt;Above I did not follow that guideline.  :-/</p><p>Sounds silly to me.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The term&apos;s meaning is quite simple: correct intonation.  Not: correct<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Correct intonation&quot; is a matter of context.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt;In many contexts, rational intonation is incorrect intonation.  I think<br/>&gt;any definition is going to have to make some reference to ratios to be<br/>&gt;accepted by most of us.</p><p>Any sound with a clearly defined pitch will oblige itself to rational<br/>intonation.  Sethares&apos; work sits at a strange point on this line, but<br/>still obeys it (he has accepted timbres with _slightly_ weaker pitch<br/>definition in exchange for _slightly_ altered rational tunings).</p><p>&gt;&gt;All verbs may eventually become nouns, but let&apos;s try to preserve meaning<br/>&gt;&gt;along the way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Agreed about preserving meaning (once we determine the meaning).  But I<br/>&gt;used it as an adjective both times.  How would it be used as a verb?</p><p>By speaking broadly, of course.  &quot;Run&quot; was a verb, and later (we assume)<br/>became a noun (a run of cards, etc.).  Too often, it seems, the phrase<br/>&quot;Just Intonation&quot; brings to mind a thing, when really, it&apos;s an action.<br/>One which has little or nothing to do with wether we use rational or<br/>irrational numbers to describe the frequency relations involved.  As the<br/>Hammond example points out (and as Herman Miller reminded, regarding<br/>the resolution of his synth), it doesn&apos;t take much to find examples of<br/>numbers from either catagory which impersonate numbers from the other,<br/>as far as the human ear is concerned.  And whichever numbers we use, we<br/>face tolerance effects almost immediately, conflicts between place and<br/>periodicity effects left and right, etc.  Intonation is tricky stuff, a<br/>bit much for a list of pitches to be expected to capture.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15963 href="#15963">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

Sorry John. You probably<br/>just got it from someone else.</p><p>From John Chalmers, Divisions of the Tetrachord (as quoted in Joe Monzo&apos;s<br/>dictionary):<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Just intonation</p><p>Any tuning system which exclusively employs intervals defined by ratios of<br/>integers may be called Just Intonation, though some authors restrict it to<br/>systems whose intervals are derived from the first six overtones, 1, 2, 3,<br/>4, 5, and 6. Such systems are often termed &quot;Five Limit&quot; or &quot;Senary&quot; systems<br/>after Zarlino&apos;s &quot;senario&quot; (Partch, 1949, 1974, 1979). The most common<br/>example of such a system is the tuning of the Major Mode as 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3<br/>3/2 5/3 15/8 and 2/1.</p><p>Just Intonation is contrasted to Equal Temperament and Unequal Temperaments<br/>such as Meantone which combine rational with irrational intervals.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Systems whose intervals are derived from the first six overtones will<br/>certainly be JI. Our forebears didn&apos;t see the need to go higher, but we do.<br/>So lets try saying that _all_ integer ratios result in just intervals.<br/>Seems like an obvious move.</p><p>Oops, now we find that we have to call something JI which can&apos;t be<br/>distinguished from 12-tET by any _measurement_, let alone by listening to<br/>it. And people start saying things like, &quot;It&apos;s the artists intent that<br/>determines whether it is JI or not&quot;. Hmm. What if the artist intended to<br/>calculate the right MIDI pitch bends but actually got them all wrong. But<br/>hey everyone still thinks it sounds cool.</p><p>This is getting needlessly narcissistic. It sounds like we&apos;ve backed<br/>ourselves into a corner here.</p><p>Ok. Let&apos;s try limiting the size of the numbers again. But we can&apos;t go too<br/>low, there&apos;s the Dream House to consider. And then some bastard shows that<br/>you can still get something that sounds like 12-tET with numbers less than<br/>those used in the Dream House. Hammond bloody organs!</p><p>Whada we do now?</p><p>Easy. Just go back to the original definition of JI.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>Definitions that don&apos;t even mention ratios<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Just intonation (abbreviated JI)</p><p>Intonation means accuracy of pitch or the process of obtaining accurate pitch.</p><p>Just intonation is accuracy of one pitch in relation to another pitch, such<br/>that the resulting interval sounds harmonically pure; perfectly in tune;<br/>beatless. Such an interval is called a justly intoned interval or just<br/>interval.</p><p>The property of just intonation is also said to be posessed by a musical<br/>work, a body of musical works, or parts of a musical work, such as a<br/>passage, tuning, scale or chord, when these contain a significant number of<br/>just intervals.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>So what counts as a &quot;significant number&quot; of just intervals for these<br/>various musical entities?</p><p>Herman Miller:</p><p>&gt;Of course,<br/>&gt;one interval that can be heard as a tempered interval doesn&apos;t make this a<br/>&gt;tempered scale any more than quarter-comma meantone is a JI scale for<br/>&gt;having just 5:4&apos;s.</p><p>Absolutely! It is certainly not necessary that every pitch form a justly<br/>intoned interval with every other pitch. That would limit us to low number<br/>harmonic (or subharmonic) series segments. I agreed with all your other<br/>comments too.</p><p>Definition:<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Justly intoned scale or Just scale (abbreviated JI scale)</p><p>A justly intoned scale is is one where every pitch can be reached from<br/>every other pitch by some chain of justly intoned intervals.</p><p>Consider a graph with a vertex for each pitch of the scale and an edge for<br/>each justly intoned interval, then a JI scale corresponds to a connected<br/>graph. A non-JI scale has two or more unconnected subgraphs.</p><p>If an interval is only perceptible as justly intoned when in some harmonic<br/>context larger than the bare interval, such an interval will count as<br/>justly intoned for the purpose of the above definition only if the scale is<br/>capable of providing that context.</p><p>If the intervals needed to connect the graph are only perceptible as justly<br/>intoned when a particular (usually inharmonic) timbre (or class of timbres)<br/>is used, then we say the scale is justly intoned for that timbre (or class<br/>of timbres).<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>What goes for &quot;JI scale&quot; above also goes for &quot;JI tuning&quot; and &quot;JI chord&quot;. I<br/>won&apos;t attempt to define what a &quot;significant number&quot; is for a passage or<br/>work or body of work.</p><p>--------------------------<br/>Now for some homework. :-)<br/>--------------------------</p><p>Q1.

But it&apos;s nothing like deciding whether a piece of music is<br/>Jazz or not. It&apos;s much lower level than that, much closer to immediate<br/>sensory perception than high level concepts like Jazz. It&apos;s more like<br/>deciding whether a painting uses mostly saturated (pure or spectral)<br/>colours as opposed to tints and shades. Whereas jazz vs. other musical<br/>styles is like abstract vs. other painting styles. Saturated colours can<br/>appear in any style of painting. JI can appear in any style of music.</p><p>Do we have to put up with a painter who claims that they have painted a<br/>rainbow realistically despite the fact that they have used pink instead of<br/>red, because they &quot;intended&quot; it to be red. Of course not. And if this is<br/>offensive, then I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;m duty bound to be offensive.</p><p>Coming to an agreement about what looks like a saturated colour and what<br/>doesn&apos;t, is arrived at culturally or socially and we recognise that there<br/>are experts in such things. We don&apos;t take much notice of people who are<br/>clearly &quot;colour blind&quot;. When we find that the expert viewers generally<br/>agree, we can start taking measurements and developing mathematical models<br/>and testing them by synthesising colours and getting the experts opinions<br/>to check our models until we have a model that is good enough to satisfy<br/>the experts. We&apos;ve done that with colour. We now have an international<br/>standard colour model that is no longer subjective.</p><p>We&apos;re some way off that with &quot;sound-colour&quot;. Colour was easy. There were<br/>only 3 receptors.</p><p>But rather than develop the maths to match the experience of experts (or<br/>even amateurs) on what sounds justly intoned (or what degree of justness<br/>something has), a ridiculously simple version of the mathematics has gone<br/>wandering off on its own, proclaiming itself to be the arbiter of true JI.</p><p>And we wonder why folks often say &quot;That JI stuff just sounds out of tune to<br/>me&quot;.

Why isn&apos;t the following a JI scale?</p><p>C#--G#     Legend:  2---3     16<br/>     \                         \<br/>      B---F#                    19<br/>           \<br/>            A---E<br/>                 \<br/>                  G---D<br/>                       \<br/>                        F---C<br/>                             \<br/>                              Eb--Bb</p><p>i.e. The fifths shown are tuned 2:3 and the minor thirds shown are tuned<br/>16:19.</p><p>Answer 1.</p><p>A bare 16:19 (or 8:19 or 4:19 etc.) interval cannot be heard as justly<br/>intoned (with ordinary timbres). That is, no beat cancellation or<br/>clarification can be perceived when it is retuned after being detuned. And<br/>the scale does not provide any larger context for the 16:19 (such as<br/>16:19:24) which might be perceived as justly intoned. Therefore the pitches<br/>are not fully connected by just intervals. Therefore it is not a just scale.</p><p>Q2. Why is the following a JI scale?</p><p>C#--G#     Legend:  2---3     0 cents<br/>     \                         \<br/>      B---F#                    294 cents<br/>           \<br/>            A---E<br/>                 \<br/>                  G---D<br/>                       \<br/>                        F---C<br/>                             \<br/>                              Eb--Bb</p><p>i.e. The fifths shown are tuned 2:3 and the minor thirds shown are tuned<br/>294 cents wide.</p><p>Answer 2.</p><p>This one was tricky. 294 cents is no more justly intoned than is 16:19,<br/>however this value of minor third happens to result in other fifths which<br/>are within 0.2 cents of 2:3 (Bb:F, C:G, D:A, E:B, F#:C#). These fifths will<br/>definitely be perceived as justly intoned and so the pitches of the scale<br/>are completely connected as a chain of fifths. Therefore this is a just<br/>scale, in fact a Pythagorean scale.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=16163 href="#16163">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2000 11:49:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What follows is a slightly edited version of a private email from myself to<br/>Margo Schulter. Margo will follow it with an edited version of her reply.<br/>We particularly ask for comment from Jacky Ligon.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&gt;The dialogue we have seen here from many able contributors has<br/>&gt;convinced me, at least, that the term &quot;JI&quot; has such different<br/>&gt;associations and premises for different people that the best we can do<br/>&gt;is to acknowledge and indeed cherish this diversity.</p><p>There is really only one major point at issue here. Is JI fundamentally<br/>(a) a mathematical property (which turns out to be inaudible and<br/>immeasurable) or<br/>(b) an audible property (which for convenience we model mathematically)?</p><p>One should certainly cherish diversity of musical forms. Such diversity<br/>will remain no matter what we call them. But I don&apos;t feel inclined to<br/>cherish diversity in the meaning of a word or phrase. Such diversity only<br/>leads to misunderstanding and thereby suffering.</p><p>Rather than give up a definition of JI as &quot;a system of tuning based on<br/>integer ratios&quot;, you have said that the Hammond organ tuning is JI, despite<br/>the fact that it cannot be distinguished from 12-tET by listening to it.</p><p>I have a synthesizer which is entirely digital, i.e. its frequencies are<br/>all derived from a single master oscillator purely by integer arithmetic.<br/>Its semitones approximate the 12th root of 2 far better even than the<br/>Hammond organ, and yet, by your definition it is tuned in just intonation.</p><p>We choose definitions to serve us. I feel very badly served, and so I<br/>suspect does Jacky Ligon, by a definition of JI that leads to inaudible<br/>distinctions such as these.</p><p>I&apos;d also like to point out that, by your definition, barbershop singing is<br/>not JI (or at least we cannot tell whether it is or not). As you would well<br/>be aware, there are no mathematical calculations involved in barbershop<br/>singing, let alone integer ratios. It is done entirely by auditory<br/>feedback. The singers listen to themselves to ensure that their chords are<br/>justly intoned (by my definition).</p><p>You might say &quot;but we can measure them&quot;.</p><p>No measurement can ever be so precise as to distinguish between a rational<br/>and an irrational number. But even a moderately precise measurement would<br/>show that they are certainly not using integer ratios where the integers<br/>are limited to 19 or less. One would probably need to go beyond 3 digits to<br/>represent the measurement results as integer ratios within the resolution<br/>of the instrument, and they would be different every time. The more precise<br/>the instrument, the larger the integers you would need to use.</p><p>I maintain that barbershop singing _epitomises_ JI and can accurately be<br/>described as 19-limit JI.</p><p>If you agree that Barbershop is JI, as most people do, how do you square<br/>this with your definition.</p><p>What is it that you fear, if we were to adopt a definition of JI based<br/>primarily on sound, not numbers.

Just intonation is either a<br/>&gt;process, or a property that something may or may not posess (or may<br/>&gt;posess to some degree). That something may certainly be either a scale<br/>&gt;or a sonority. I see no confusion.</p><p>Perhaps you did make the distinction -- forgive me.  But I did see<br/>confusion on this issue among other posts in this thread.</p><p>&gt;A _scale_ is only justly intoned if it allows enough _sonorities_ which<br/>&gt;are justly intoned.</p><p>And which ones are those?  How much is enough?  And if I use the scale<br/>only for dissonance, is it still a &quot;just&quot; tuning?</p><p>&gt;The part of that definition that I disagree with (and John Chalmers has<br/>&gt;already repudiated (correct me if I&apos;m wrong John)) is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Any tuning system which exclusively employs intervals defined by ratios<br/>&gt;of integers may be called Just Intonation, ...&quot;<br/>//<br/>&gt;the major issue of whether JI is something you can _hear_, or whether it<br/>&gt;really only depends on whether its designer used integer math or not.</p><p>I would prefer to make it something one can hear, but for scales, it&apos;s<br/>just too hard a problem.  Methods don&apos;t nearly exist to solve it, and<br/>it seems unreasonable to require such analysis for the use of such an<br/>established phrase.</p><p>&gt;&gt;and one which even refers to a particular scale.  As John pointed<br/>&gt;&gt;out, there is excellent support for this definition<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which definition? _Any_ integer ratios?</p><p>I meant the intense diatonic.  But there&apos;s also excellent support for<br/>the integer math definition, especially within our community.  Lots of<br/>folks use the term that way.  Definition is a descriptive endeavor,<br/>remember.  Because I agree with you, I do suggest dropping the use of<br/>&quot;just intonation&quot; in reference to scales, but that is as far as I will go.</p><p>&gt;&gt;in fact, it may be the most accurate definition outside of this community.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since you say this, I guess you mean either 5-limit JI or the particular<br/>&gt;scale 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1.</p><p>Correct.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And the fruits of such a labor are probably non-existent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I totally disagree.</p><p>People will still use their scales, and I doubt that any secrets of<br/>music are hiding in the distinction between a just scale (as you define<br/>it) and not.  There are secrets to discover solving the tolerance<br/>problem, and we are not yet there.  But even when we arrive, another<br/>very difficult, and I will claim fruitless, level is needed to apply it<br/>to scales and yield your definition.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Which is why I suggested we forget the idea, and stick to definitions<br/>&gt;&gt;of the latter type.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So what&apos;s your favourite definition of a JI (justly intoned) sonority?</p><p>I very much like:</p><p>&quot;A group of pitches is said to be justly intoned when beating cannot<br/>be heard.&quot;</p><p>A potential weakness of this definition is that it allows a single<br/>complex tone (IOW, a timbre) to be considered JI.  However, I actually<br/>consider this a strength.  Can anyone guess why?</p><p>&gt;I get the feeling that there&apos;s a lotta people out there that agree with<br/>&gt;me when I say &quot;believe your ears, not the numbers&quot;, but are afraid to<br/>&gt;come right out and say so.

Is JI<br/>fundamentally<br/>&gt; (a) a mathematical property (which turns out to be inaudible and<br/>&gt; immeasurable) or<br/>&gt; (b) an audible property (which for convenience we model<br/>mathematically)?</p><p>Dave,</p><p>Hello!</p><p>Perhaps a little of both. Is sub atomic matter &quot;particles&quot;<br/>or &quot;waves&quot;? Depends on how you choose to look at it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rather than give up a definition of JI as &quot;a system of tuning based<br/>on<br/>&gt; integer ratios&quot;, you have said that the Hammond organ tuning is JI,<br/>despite<br/>&gt; the fact that it cannot be distinguished from 12-tET by listening<br/>to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a synthesizer which is entirely digital, i.e. its<br/>frequencies are<br/>&gt; all derived from a single master oscillator purely by integer<br/>arithmetic.<br/>&gt; Its semitones approximate the 12th root of 2 far better even than<br/>the<br/>&gt; Hammond organ, and yet, by your definition it is tuned in just<br/>intonation.</p><p>The most interesting fact here for me, is that even such a perverse<br/>arrangement of pitches as this is found in the spectrum of integer<br/>ratios. This is using the ratios to approximate the temperament, and<br/>no knowing JI composer would deliberately seek this out as an example<br/>of a JI tuning. It&apos;s a tough call, but I think the goal with the<br/>tuning of these tempered instruments is quite a different concern<br/>than that of tuning by ratios in the normal JI sense -  which would<br/>likely yield a scale of uneven steps.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; We choose definitions to serve us. I feel very badly served, and so<br/>I<br/>&gt; suspect does Jacky Ligon, by a definition of JI that leads to<br/>inaudible<br/>&gt; distinctions such as these.</p><p>Since this quandary of terminology is a concern, as far as detailing<br/>compositional notes on upcoming CD releases, I would like to put<br/>forth a few questions on this topic by way of musical scenario.</p><p>It is an important part of my compositional process, to transform the<br/>tunings of individual instruments, or groups of timbres over the<br/>course of a composition. It is common for me to introduce more<br/>complexity as the composition evolves - which may include starting<br/>with simple JI intervals, and evolving to more complex higher primes.<br/>Suppose at the beginning of a piece, I use a simple mode capable of<br/>playing justly intoned &quot;beatless&quot; intervals, such as:</p><p>Ratio Cents Value<br/>1/1   0<br/>9/8   203.9100017<br/>5/4   386.3137139<br/>4/3   498.0449991<br/>3/2   701.9550009<br/>8/5   813.6862861<br/>16/9  996.0899983<br/>2/1   1200</p><p>And imaging this mode is used for the first 20-30 seconds of the<br/>piece, playing on perhaps flutes and strings, when I might introduce:</p><p>Ratio Cents Value<br/>1/1 0<br/>21/20 84.46719347<br/>21/19 173.2678912<br/>28/23 340.5515592<br/>26/21 369.7467544<br/>30/23 459.9943675<br/>40/29 556.7365197<br/>29/20 643.2634803<br/>23/15 740.0056325<br/>21/13 830.2532456<br/>23/14 859.4484408<br/>38/21 1026.732109<br/>40/21 1115.532807<br/>2/1     1200</p><p>Playing on a Santoor. After about 10 seconds I might return to the<br/>simple mode again for a reiteration of it&apos;s &quot;mood&quot; for another 15<br/>seconds, when I might introduce completely new timbres and a new<br/>tuning, such as:</p><p>  0:          1/1             0.000<br/>  1:     206720/180879        231.184<br/>  2:     221792/180879        353.019<br/>  3:    1248926/904395        558.796<br/>  4:    1378112/904395        729.202<br/>  5:     103360/60293         933.139<br/>  6:    1754956/904395       1147.692<br/>  7:    1798022/904395       1189.663</p><p>A spectrum mode for tuned Burmese Nipple Gongs. This tuning sounds<br/>completely correct and concordant playing on this timbre - the fifth<br/>sounds in tune, although I&apos;m not sure one would call it &quot;beatless&quot;<br/>since metal instruments can beat within the timbre, but in this case<br/>the tuning matches the timbre.</p><p>At this point of the compositional scenario, I make the flutes heard<br/>in the opening change their tuning to that of the Burmese nipple<br/>gongs, for a kind lovely tension, followed immediately by a<br/>sectional &quot;resolve&quot; where the flutes/strings again change back to the<br/>original simple major mode and are joined by the Santoor.</p><p>Now the questions:</p><p>1. Is my composition in Just Intonation?</p><p>2. Or is only a part of it in JI?</p><p>3. At what point (prime - odd - whatever) do I cross the barrier of<br/>complexity and disqualify my composition from the label of &quot;JI&quot;?</p><p>4. How do I reconcile the fact that my piece has a range of simple to<br/>complex integer ratios, sometimes &quot;justly intoning&quot; beatless<br/>intervals, and alternately injecting tuning shifts to more complex<br/>structures, which might not fit the text book classification of JI?</p><p>5. What the heck do you call music that morphs it&apos;s tunings in this<br/>manner, if not JI?</p><p>As I see it, there has been for many, a general evolution of the<br/>meaning of the term JI; one that has perhaps broadened to accommodate<br/>our contemporary sensibilities, and desire for more complex<br/>structures. And I see your point about the generally accepted<br/>meaning. The difficultly for me personally, is that if a composer is<br/>using as the foundation of their harmonic vocabulary &quot;justly intoned&quot;<br/>intervals, yet also includes ratios which do not fit the beatless<br/>criteria as a part of the compositional &quot;flavor&quot;, then perhaps we can<br/>allow this stretch of terminology.</p><p>I had never questioned that what I was doing was JI or not, until my<br/>arrival on the Tuning List - I always assumed it was JI, because of<br/>the above rationale. But even considering this, I hardly feel it&apos;s<br/>all that important to quibble about, since my main goal is to use a<br/>broad range of simple to complex ratios in my compositions,<br/>regardless of labels. In the end it&apos;s &quot;Music&quot; that I&apos;m concerned<br/>with. The most important label of all!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I maintain that barbershop singing _epitomizes_ JI and can<br/>accurately be<br/>&gt; described as 19-limit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you agree that Barbershop is JI, as most people do, how do you<br/>square<br/>&gt; this with your definition.</p><p>Ah, so it&apos;s &quot;19&quot;!? Well that leaves me a wanderer in the wilderness<br/>of the ones without name! It is my direct experience though, that<br/>singers can be trained to sing higher than 19 prime with remarkable<br/>precision. In fact this will soon become a priority area of musical<br/>focus -  the results are so compelling!</p><p>&gt; What is it that you fear, if we were to adopt a definition of JI<br/>based<br/>&gt; primarily on sound, not numbers.</p><p>Perhaps it is appropriate to not discount either. There&apos;s no resource<br/>I&apos;m willing to reject.</p><p>&gt; Are you afraid of losing something<br/>&gt; valuable. If so, please try to explain to me what it is.</p><p>My fear is that we might lose the flexibility to expand this<br/>definition to include the broader meaning that it has assumed for<br/>many. Who wants to be the person to tell Kraig Grady or La Monte<br/>Young - or anyone using high prime ratios, that what they call Just<br/>Intonation, has been ruled incorrect by our friendly forum? Surely a<br/>consensus here would be meaningless without the input from these<br/>masters, who have helped to broaden the meaning of JI.</p><p>Thanks Dave, for the wonderfully penetrating questions into this<br/>topic,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>P.S.

I&apos;d tend to<br/>say that even this term would not apply to tunings using<br/>prime-factors above, say, 37 or 43, except in specific<br/>circumstances such as La Monte Young&apos;s compositions, where<br/>the style of performance demands that even primes above<br/>200 be heard as harmonic ratios.  My reasons for choosing<br/>those particular primes are based on the prime-limits<br/>encountered in so-called &apos;extended JI&apos; compositions by Ben<br/>Johnston, Ezra Sims, and myself.</p><p>But, again IMO, the terms &apos;just-intonation&apos; or &apos;JI&apos; without<br/>further qualification should really mean specifically 5-limit<br/>JI *where prime-factor 5 never has an absolute exponent limit<br/>higher than 1 in any given sonority*.  This pretty much amounts<br/>to an integer-limit of 24 within a prime-limit of 5.  I would<br/>cite mainly historical usage of the term over the last 500 years<br/>to defend my position on this.</p><p>To my mind, a composer like Partch, whose stipulated tuning<br/>system was 11-limit (prime or odd), and who referred to it as<br/>&apos;just&apos;, represents the grey area between these attempts at<br/>precision.  But please note that Partch was also careful to<br/>employ the term &apos;Monophony&apos; to describe his specific tuning<br/>system.</p><p>I stand by my use of the term &apos;rational tuning&apos; for all rational<br/>tunings generally, and for those above the &apos;extended JI&apos; limits<br/>(37, 43...?) specifically.</p><p>Dave K., I believe I&apos;ve already admitted clearly in previous posts<br/>that I agree with you that &apos;tempering&apos; is one way of describing<br/>what I did in _3 Plus 4_ in regard to the 64:75:96 triad.  But I<br/>also said (agreeing with David Finnamore) that &apos;extended reference&apos;<br/>came into play too, in my decision to tune that &apos;minor 3rd&apos; as<br/>64:75.  Perhaps I&apos;ve been a bit sloppy in describing this piece<br/>and others on my website as &apos;JI&apos; without using the qualification<br/>&apos;extended&apos;, but let it be said here that I still feel that the<br/>tuning of the 1999 version of _3 Plus 4_ is best characterized<br/>as &apos;extended just-intonation&apos;.</p><p>Given my very personal ideas about religion in general, I&apos;m<br/>certainly not at all concerned about being kicked out of the<br/>&apos;Church of JI&apos;, or any other.  But as the author of the online<br/>Tuning Dictionary, I think it behooves me to engage myself<br/>considerably in ascertaining a definition of just-intonation<br/>with which the largest number of composers, theorists, and<br/>- yes - mathematicians will agree, and which will enable all<br/>of us to continue theoretical discourse which makes abundant<br/>use of the term and still makes sense.</p><p>Given the constraints on my time these days, I humbly invite<br/>anyone interested in this thread to submit *concise* corrections<br/>and additions to my Dictionary entry:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/just.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/just.htm</a></p><p>Please post them here first so they may be subject to debate.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3><a id=16193 href="#16193">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2000 7:56:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dave Keenan wrote...]<br/>&gt;For some dumb reason, I said barbershop was 19-limit JI.

If I&apos;m right that your 19-limit analysis is made to account for chords such<br/>as those approximating 16:19:24, then I would say it&apos;s not necessary to use numbers that high<br/>for them.  I think they should be analyzed as 1/(6:5:4) chords where the minor third is<br/>tempered to reduce melodic &quot;pain.&quot;  That still makes for JI in my book, since the chief goal is<br/>to make things beatless, even though that goal is balanced with other considerations.  I don&apos;t<br/>think I would say that it epitomizes JI, though.  The epitome would be music in which the<br/>exclusive goal was to make chords beatless, no compromises allowed.</p><p>But in principal, I agree with the rest of that post, as far as it goes (the edited version of<br/>the one originally sent off-list to Margo).  Margo said it very well not long ago: it&apos;s a<br/>matter of first principles.  Some of us (Margo and I, it seems, perhaps some others) believe<br/>that the math came first, and existential matter followed it.  The validity of that premise is<br/>a matter for another list, but the premise itself affects how we want to define certain terms<br/>on this list.</p><p>I especially agree with you, Dave, that a single, universally accepted definition of JI should<br/>be achieved.

Something that seems to sound<br/>correct in the context.
