There appears to be an additional phenomenon,<br/>&gt; &quot;rootedness&quot;, which gives the lowest sounding note an extra<br/>&gt; probabilistic boost in its likelihood of being interpreted as<br/>&gt; octave-equivalent to the fundamental. This would explain why, for<br/>&gt; example, 4:5:6 is more &quot;consonant&quot; than 3:4:5.</p><p>In turn, Paul, please let me express my agreement with your earlier<br/>point that Partch&apos;s &quot;otonal/utonal&quot; distinction may be intended to<br/>address a different issue that the one I&apos;m focusing on: the parallel<br/>between 3-limit trinic and 5-limit triadic conversities, or sonorities<br/>with the same intervals in &quot;converse&quot; or &quot;mirror-reflection&quot;<br/>arrangements.</p><p>Historically, Western European theorists have tended to focus on two<br/>kinds of affinities between sonorities. What I term the &quot;conversities&quot;<br/>of 13th-16th century theory share the same set of intervals in<br/>different arrangements, while 17th-19th century &quot;inversions&quot; share the<br/>same set of pitch classes in different octave transpositions. Neither<br/>approach necessarily exhausts all the relevant parameters and<br/>variations.</p><p>An interesting conclusion which might be drawn from your comment above<br/>is that not all octave transpositions are equally &quot;equivalent&quot; -- not<br/>only are the 3-limit trines 2:3:4 and 3:4:6 distinct (here I use<br/>frequency-ratios in the usual modern manner), which are conversities<br/>as well as inversions, but also the 5-limit forms 4:5:6 and 3:4:5,<br/>which are inversions but not conversities.</p><p>As a medievalist often tending to think in terms of &quot;octave affinity&quot;<br/>rather than exact equivalence, I can come up with other examples. For<br/>example, I find 4:6:9 in a Gothic context as relatively blending but<br/>still unstable, with considerable &quot;tension&quot; -- yet 1:3:9 or 1:6:9 (the<br/>latter being easier for one person to play on a conventional keyboard)<br/>sounds like a curiously stable sonority, with enough acoustical<br/>&quot;space&quot; for all the tones to coexist without such tension. Jacobus of<br/>Liege may be making the same point around 1325 when he terms 9:4 an<br/>&quot;intermediate concord,&quot; but 9:1 a &quot;perfect concord.&quot;</p><p>Getting back to 2:3:4 vs. 3:4:6, and 4:5:6 vs. 3:4:5, some<br/>20th-century theory speaks of a &quot;perfect fifth anchor&quot; which tends to<br/>reinforce what you term a sense of &quot;rootedness.&quot; At the same time,<br/>with 2:3:4 and 4:5:6, there&apos;s the factor of the lowest tone as an even<br/>octave of the fundamental that we&apos;ve both noted.</p><p>From another angle, using &quot;smooth&quot; in a way which may not necessarily<br/>be synonymous with your &quot;smoothness,&quot; I&apos;m tempted to guess that 2:3:4<br/>may be more &quot;smooth&quot; than 3:4:6 because the fourth above the lowest<br/>note of the latter sonority may be in tension with the third partial<br/>of the lowest note. Likewise, might this tension come into play with<br/>the lower fourth of a 3:4:5 sonority vis-a-vis a 4:5:6 sonority?</p><p>Analogously, it has been said that the lower minor third of 10:12:15 is in<br/>tension with the fifth partial of the lower note -- like the lower<br/>fourth of 3:4:6 in relation to the third partial of the lower<br/>note. Joseph Yasser, as I recall, in his &quot;Medieval Quartal Harmony&quot;<br/>therefore refers to 2:3:4 and 4:5:6 as &quot;resonant&quot; forms, and to 3:4:6<br/>and 10:12:15 as &quot;irresonant&quot; forms.</p><p>A parallel here is that 3:4:6 is in tension with the third partial<br/>(3-limit), while 10:12:15 is in tension with the fifth partial<br/>(5-limit).</p><p>Anyway, this is a very interesting dialogue. You&apos;re evidently coming<br/>from a perspective in part of 18th-century inversion theory, while I&apos;m<br/>coming from a perspective of what I might term 13th-16th century<br/>conversity theory -- but in either case, more recent theorists about<br/>concord/discord and the like can add new elements.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
