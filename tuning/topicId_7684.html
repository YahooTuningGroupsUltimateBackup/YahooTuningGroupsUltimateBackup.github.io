The feeling you describe is one of<br/>&gt; the pleasures I find in singing music in an ensemble (or listening to such<br/>&gt; music). I would describe it as in tune, in focus, in sync, locked,<br/>&gt; ensemble, in step, fused, or together. I find that when a chord is locked,<br/>&gt; which I believe involves accuracy of pitch, vowel, and dynamics, everyone<br/>&gt; agrees about it being locked. For me it feels as if there is a new thing in<br/>&gt; the room. I think that the pleasure of singing harmony (in my group,<br/>&gt; generally five-part) comes from the fact that the individuals are able to<br/>&gt; come together and create something that no one could on his own, while each<br/>&gt; maintains his individuality. It is pleasurable to be in such a relationship<br/>&gt; with others.</p><p>Well said, John. I&apos;ve often remarked that choral singing is a microcosm of<br/>democracy in which we voluntarily give up a part of our &quot;freedom&quot; to get a<br/>lot back in return.</p><p>&gt; Your example of learning a descending scale of small intervals feeling<br/>&gt; larger and larger is important in that it shows that our perceptual<br/>&gt; abilities are not fixed but may be developed through appropriate learning<br/>&gt; situations. Because of this I&apos;ve always been suspicious when I&apos;ve read some<br/>&gt; report of the just-perceivable difference in pitch, as if that were a fixed<br/>&gt; quantity. I know that it can be decreased as we learn to increase our<br/>&gt; sensitivity. A contrasting experience I&apos;ve had as a singer is that of<br/>&gt; feeling like the leap of an octave is a _small_ distance. That feeling can<br/>&gt; be produced by experimenting with arpeggios and leaps of two octaves or<br/>&gt; more, or playing funny games like singing a simple melody and tranposing<br/>&gt; every other note up an octave.</p><p>Your observations remind us that musical intervals are not really<br/>&quot;distances&quot; but &quot;agreements.&quot; In that sense, the octave is the &quot;same pitch&quot;<br/>and has &quot;gone nowhere&quot; (almost).</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=7690 href="#7690">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>1/10/2000 7:45:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;Gerald Eskelin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stg3music@earthlink.net">stg3music@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve often remarked that choral singing is a microcosm of<br/>&gt;democracy in which we voluntarily give up a part of our &quot;freedom&quot; to get a<br/>&gt;lot back in return.</p><p>My preference for one-person-per-part music, whether or not it is vocal, is<br/>due largely to the responsibility that it places on each of the<br/>individuals, and to its minimizing of the loss of freedom. I&apos;m not as wild<br/>about choral music (or any music where parts are performed by more than one<br/>musician) because for my taste it requires a lot of uniformity. In general<br/>I&apos;d rather be a member of a small organization than a large one.</p><p>&gt;Your observations remind us that musical intervals are not really<br/>&gt;&quot;distances&quot; but &quot;agreements.&quot; In that sense, the octave is the &quot;same pitch&quot;<br/>&gt;and has &quot;gone nowhere&quot; (almost).</p><p>I think you may have missed my point. From a singer&apos;s point of view moving<br/>an octave is not going nowhere. It is a substantial movement and requires<br/>quite an adjustment of the vocal apparatus. I meant to suggest a way to<br/>increase one&apos;s ability to sing large intervals. I should have used a<br/>different interval, say a major tenth, to illustrate my point. And if<br/>anyone would ask, where is a singer ever asked to sing a major tenth, I<br/>would reply that it is required several times in Chopin&apos;s Nocturne in Eb,<br/>Opus 9, No. 2, which will NOT be on my forthcoming CD (maybe the next<br/>one?). And if one can sing a major tenth with ease then the usual sort of<br/>big intervals will be a breeze.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div>
