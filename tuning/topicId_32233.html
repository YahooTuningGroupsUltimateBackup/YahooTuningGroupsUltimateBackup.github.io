On his site you&apos;ll see a number of MIDI hardware and software<br/>projects, some for free and some for sale.  I have been in touch with Jordan<br/>concerning microtonal MIDI keyboard controllers, and he is receptive to<br/>collaboration for the development of these.  Because many list members would<br/>benefit from a MIDI controller built for specific needs, (for example, for<br/>the &quot;blackjack&quot; scale or whatever it is that suits you) I think it&apos;s well<br/>worth it to consider the possibilities of building such controllers<br/>affordably through this kind of collaboration.  Jordan&apos;s MIDI projects show<br/>that the _circuitry needed by such controllers is not complicated, and can be<br/>affordable.  The circuitry he builds can be linked to any kind of key<br/>mechanism.  This hardware can be as cheap or as expensive as you want.  For<br/>example, for controllers I&apos;ve built, I use cheap momentary push-buttons for<br/>24 cents apiece over the web from from</p><p><a href="http://www.web-tronics.com/">http://www.web-tronics.com/</a></p><p>which give me simple note/on note/off at fixed velocity.  Velocity sensing<br/>becomes more expensive, of course, but I&apos;m content with cheap controllers<br/>that allow custom key layouts.  Maybe you would be too.</p><p>Anyway, this is an interesting website from an interesting inventor.  Enjoy.</p><p>best,<br/>Aaron</p></div>
