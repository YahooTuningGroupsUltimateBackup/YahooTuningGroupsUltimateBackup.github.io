Many thanks<br/>to Nick Dan for this who did a lot of work in getting it to compile<br/>and making an installer. Also to Marc Sabat for testing the installer<br/>until   the problems were all fixed.<br/>Unfortunately it will not run on 10.3 for technical reasons concerning<br/>the <a href="http://X11.app">X11.app</a> from Apple.<br/>This Mac version is now also out of the beta stage, which means<br/>everything is supposed to work normally.<br/>There is currently one small known problem: if you try to select a<br/>notation system in the Select Notation System dialog with a keyboard<br/>key, it will crash, so only use the mouse there.<br/>Follow the installation directions on the Download page carefully,<br/>because it&apos;s slightly different from the previous version.<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div>
