Was it too difficult? Could anything have been<br/>&gt; explained better? Does anyone still have any interest in this subject?<br/>&gt;</p><p>When I saw this I went back and found it. I had &apos;breezed through&apos; about 60<br/>digests when I got back from vacation and in the middle of the &quot;modern music<br/>and modern world eruption&quot;, missed it. So I went back, dutifully pasted the<br/>sections together and 1) its great, 2) please continue, 3) now I know what<br/>this matrix notation is referring to.</p><p>Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
