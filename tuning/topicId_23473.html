It wasn&apos;t the piece that my mother wanted to hear, or<br/>the one most favorably received by the audience, plus I completely<br/>botched an important part of the melody, but perhaps it made for<br/>better programming (notice how it was in the same &quot;key&quot; as Marc<br/>Jones&apos; 32-tET piece that immediately followed it). In any case, I<br/>just wanted to say I appreciate Johnny overlooking our many<br/>differences of opinion on this list and finding my music of enough<br/>interest to be broadcast.</p><p>P.S. Ara did co-compose the piece -- actually, it was more of a co-<br/>improvisation on a co-composed set of chord changes -- so perhaps he<br/>feels slighted that you named only me as the composer . . . or<br/>perhaps he doesn&apos;t care . . . I think he should at least be given<br/>acknowledgement in the future, though.</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2001 3:52:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/21/01 4:53 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; but perhaps it made for<br/>&gt; better programming (notice how it was in the same &quot;key&quot; as Marc<br/>&gt; Jones&apos; 32-tET piece that immediately followed it).</p><p>HA!!!<br/>That scared the hell out of me actually!!<br/>It was like &quot;wait I know this part...&quot; AAAAA IT&apos;S ME<br/>This is the first time I&apos;ve ever been on the radio, so...<br/>it didn&apos;t really register until it happened.</p><p>It&apos;s bizarre because my whole piece was in G major,<br/>except that movement was in A minor.<br/>And I tune about 121 cents down from &quot;A=440&quot;.</p><p>I listened to a tape of the show the next day with Johnny.<br/>We rewound it but couldn&apos;t really perceive a difference at all.<br/>A couple cents *maybe* but you couldn&apos;t tell with the timbre change.</p><p>Coincedence?
