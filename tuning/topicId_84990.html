Known progressions to indicate key help<br/>decide which key it is, as well as your ear. It&apos;s often chords resolving to<br/>a certain chord (often major) that indicates the key.<br/>I&apos;ve found it doesn&apos;t work well for JI to look at simple diatonic major<br/>minor scales.<br/>Instead I use a full 12tone JI scale of 1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2<br/>8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 and decide the key from this.<br/>For instance D F A -&gt; A C# E I find to be in C# key, making 1/1 4/3 8/5 -&gt;<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2, beeing a mode other than major or minor.<br/>Hope this helps.<br/>Will comming time post several pieces put in JI in this way.</p><p>Marcel</p></div>
