Gene want 612).</p><p>We have 7 nominals for most ETs, but not all.  Per Table 3 of my<br/>paper, we do 16 as a subset of 48 (that includes D, although I notice<br/>that I didn&apos;t say that in the paper).  In Table 4 the multiples of 5<br/>are notated with 5 nominals, CGDAE, but preferably as subsets of<br/>larger ETs (5 &amp; 10 out of 50, 15 out of 60).  We do most of the<br/>divisions that aren&apos;t 1,3,9-consistent as subsets of larger<br/>divisions, although we have also given native-fifth notations for<br/>some of these (7, 14, 21, 45, 49, 57, 64) as an option.</p><p>--George</p></div>
