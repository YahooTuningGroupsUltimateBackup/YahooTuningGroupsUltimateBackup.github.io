(except, e. g. the &quot;bicinium&quot;, etc.). These chords comprise thus<br/>at least 3 tones. Whereas earlier times &quot;tolerated&quot; even the somewhat<br/>harsh Pythagorean thirds, tastes and preferences changed and developed in<br/>thecourse of history. One adopted the extreme of going for PERFECT thirds in<br/>mean-tone.</p><p>(When tuning consistently and very accurately - why not - a harpsichord,<br/>one fell automatically at one point into a major third about<br/>384,36 cent wide, i.e . smaller by 2 cent than pure. This discovery,<br/>pleasant to the ear, certainly gave rise to the desire to hear more of this<br/>sort).</p><p>One took thus PERFECT thirds for mean-tone. This, not only in<br/>contradistinction to Pythagorean, but at the same time mean-tone is set<br/>off from the system of natural harmony that puts basically a perfect<br/>triad 4:5:6 (in terms of frequencies), say upon C-major. Constructing this<br/>system further, produces the annoying fact that the tones C-D and D-E are<br/>different and drastically reduced fifths, by one comma, show up.</p><p>Once having placed instead the perfect third on C-E and filled it up by<br/>tempering four EQUAL fifths, equalizes the sizes of C-D and D-E.<br/>Within the straightforward principle of mean-tone (with pure thirds and<br/>payung no attention or concern for anything else) let us consider<br/>the TRIAD C-E-G.</p><p>Wasn&apos;t in the natural harmonic system the triad the pertinent feature?<br/>Mean-tone concentrates on the single and unique interval of the major third.<br/>But the music under consideration proceeds via the harmonies of chords.<br/>Within mean-tone, the overall purity of C-E-G can be &quot;improved&quot;, in analogy to<br/>the step of improvement that went from the Pythagorean third to the &quot;better&quot;<br/>mean-tone third.</p><p>Despite its pure third, the mesotonic triad will BEAT. To get things<br/>&quot;purer&quot;, shouldn&apos;t one attempt to reduce the beats? These triads<br/>beat: not because of the third that is pure, but due to the fifth C-G.<br/>This is one of the 4 fifths that has to be necessarily tempered smaller<br/>in order to fit into its perfect third.<br/>As the triad beats anyway, does it really make sense to insist on a pure<br/>third? Obviously, NO! and the third may be relaxed, up to the order<br/>of its beat-rate becoming comparable to the rapidity of beats of<br/>the fifth. Enlarging the third somewhat will slow down the beats of the<br/>fifth. The ideal &quot;meeting/compromise point&quot; will be the situation<br/>in which - within a tempered triad - both its principal constituent<br/>intervals third and fifth beat at the UNISON. What sufficient reason could<br/>produce a BETTER COMPROMISE??<br/>          ******************</p><p>Conclusion: the basis of musical progressions - in some sense - are chords<br/>and not just intervals. This is borne out when basing the music upon<br/>triads, the most elementary cords. And here, the major chord - trias<br/>harmonica perfecta. As to the overall tempering of this basic musical entity,<br/>the triad &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; is the best and most natural one to attain, derived<br/>here heuristically, not via the detailed mathematics. Quality criterion for<br/>purity and consonance was the behaviour of beats, i. e. their rapidity.</p><p>Having derived this triad, the step to extend this triad to a system<br/>&quot;wohltemperirt&quot; follows, But this is very simple. Due to a surprising and<br/>incredible mathematical co-incidence, the fifth of the triad &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;<br/>explained above, is reduced by 1/5 of the Pythagorean Comma!!!</p><p>Therefore, given the 5 tempered fifths, one can complete the circle with the<br/>finality of closure by the further 7 perfect fifths.Musico-theological aspects<br/>now enter into the play: If we insist that the &quot;best major triad&quot; feasible in a<br/>balanced system for all 24 keys just occurs just ONCE, and not more, then B-F#<br/>must be the 5th tempered fifth.</p><p>As regards MINOR: provided a major triad is acceptable or supportable, the<br/>interpolating minor third following the basic major third will also be<br/>acceptable. If the tempered fifths themselves are acceptable, the minor<br/>chords constructed using this material will as well be acceptable. Thus,<br/>&quot;wohltemperirt&quot; yields and represents a temperament for all 24 keys.</p><p>Ad 2)<br/>Having said the above, I can see nothing in Zarlino&apos;s concept of &quot;harmonia<br/>perfetta&quot;, that would favor any one specific meantone tuning. The mesotonic<br/>system definitely gives room for improvement, technologically/mathematically<br/>and spiritually under the musico-theological aspects, perhaps best enounced<br/>in almost all of Werckmeister&apos;s writings.</p><p>I am grateful and have very much appreciated Mrs. Margot Schulter&apos;s<br/>excellent expos&iuml;&iquest;&half; about the trias harmonica and even more, her critical<br/>query I hope to have answered here more or less satisfactorily.</p><p>(When pretending music progresses by CHORDS I do not attempt to offer<br/>a treatise on counterpoint).</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Herbert Anton Kellner</p></div><h3><a id=26173 href="#26173">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2001 9:28:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Herbert-Anton,</p><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:ha.kellner@t-online.de">ha.kellner@t-online.de</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, July 13, 2001 1:59 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] trias harmonica - for Margot Schulter<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Mrs. Margot Schulter, dear members of the group,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A recent question by Margot Schulter to quote:</p><p>A spelling correction: Her first name is spelled &quot;Margo&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Ad 1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Margo Schulter:]<br/>&gt; &gt; Does the concept of the triad necessarily favor any one<br/>&gt; &gt; well-temperament, given that all are compromises?<br/>&gt;                                        ***********<br/>&gt; The music under consideration proceeds via the harmonies of<br/>&gt; the chords. (except, e. g. the &quot;bicinium&quot;, etc.). These chords<br/>&gt; comprise thus at least 3 tones.

One adopted the extreme of going for PERFECT thirds<br/>&gt; in mean-tone.</p><p>While the description you give here and in what follows is<br/>basically correct, there are a few points I&apos;d like to observe.</p><p>As Margo, whose main interest is music and tuning of the &quot;Gothic&quot;<br/>(i.e., medieval) period, will be well aware, it is not really<br/>correct to express the viewpoint that &apos;earlier times &quot;tolerated&quot;<br/>even the somewhat harsh Pythagorean thirds&apos;.  Use of the word<br/>&quot;tolerate&quot; betrays a bias based on later harmonic practice,<br/>in which the &quot;pure&quot; 5:4 ratio was considered the most desirable<br/>type of &quot;major 3rd&quot;.</p><p>Many theorists, Margo perhaps cheif among them, have argued<br/>quite persuasively that medieval European musical sensibilites<br/>did not merely &quot;tolerate&quot; the &quot;somewhat harsh Pythagorean thirds&quot;,<br/>but rather, *embraced* them enthusiastically as an important part<br/>of the overall musical aesthetic.  The &quot;rules&quot; of harmony and<br/>counterpoint during the &quot;Gothic&quot; period are based in large part<br/>on the dissonance or &quot;imperfect consonance&quot; of the Pythagorean<br/>&quot;major 3rd&quot; with ratio 81:64 = ~407.8200035 cents.</p><p>It&apos;s very important to keep this in mind when analyzing the<br/>*later* historical development of harmonic practice.  It was only<br/>around the 1300s (at the earliest) to 1500s in standard European<br/>theory that the &quot;pure&quot; consonance of the 5:4 &quot;major 3rd&quot; became<br/>a desirable part of the harmonic vocabulary.</p><p>At that point, rather than &quot;tolerate&quot; the Pythagorean 3rds, tuning<br/>systems were advocated which were adjusted from the 3-limit to the<br/>5-limit (see &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/limit.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/limit.htm</a>&gt; if<br/>unclear about &quot;limits&quot;), so that the 5:4 and 6:5 &quot;3rds&quot; could<br/>be employed.  There was an overall paradigm shift at this time<br/>in which these &quot;3rds&quot; became the basis of harmonic practice.<br/>Note that _a capella_ vocal music was considered the stylistic<br/>paradigm at this time.</p><p>(See my long tuning list post of Mon Jun 7, 1999  10:01 pm<br/>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_3380.html#3380">/tuning/topicId_3380.html#3380</a>&gt;<br/>and Margo&apos;s reply of Tue Jun 8, 1999  8:03 pm<br/>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_3422.html#3422">/tuning/topicId_3422.html#3422</a>&gt;.)</p><p>&gt; (When tuning consistently and very accurately - why not<br/>&gt; - a harpsichord, one fell automatically at one point into<br/>&gt; a major third about 384,36 cent wide, i.e . smaller by<br/>&gt; 2 cent than pure. This discovery, pleasant to the ear,<br/>&gt; certainly gave rise to the desire to hear more of this sort).</p><p>As you describe above, tuning a series of eight &quot;4ths&quot; and &quot;5ths&quot;<br/>as pure Pythagorean ratios 4:3 and 3:2 respectively, results<br/>in the ratio (2^11)*(3^-8) = ~384.3599931 cents, which is<br/>~1.953720788 cents narrower than the 5:4 ratio, but audibly<br/>indistinguishable from it under almost all circumstances.</p><p>This extension of the Pythagorean system to the point where<br/>skhismatic equivalents of 5-limit pitches appear is indeed a<br/>very plausible explanation for the introduction of 5-limit<br/>ratios themselves.  [See Lindley/Turner-Smith 1993, p 136-138]</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; One took thus PERFECT thirds for mean-tone. This, not only<br/>&gt; in contradistinction to Pythagorean, but at the same time<br/>&gt; mean-tone is set off from the system of natural harmony that<br/>&gt; puts basically a perfect triad 4:5:6 (in terms of frequencies),<br/>&gt; say upon C-major. Constructing this system further, produces<br/>&gt; the annoying fact that the tones C-D and D-E are different<br/>&gt; and drastically reduced fifths, by one comma, show up.</p><p>Of course as you describe here, the use of strict 5-limit<br/>just-intonation will often lead to problems in dealing with<br/>the appearance of the syntonic comma.  The first solution to<br/>this was to temper the primary offending note, which was the<br/>supertonic (2nd degree of the diatonic scale), thus: meantone.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once having placed instead the perfect third on C-E<br/>&gt; and filled it up by tempering four EQUAL fifths,<br/>&gt; equalizes the sizes of C-D and D-E.  Within the<br/>&gt; straightforward principle of mean-tone (with pure<br/>&gt; thirds and payung no attention or concern for anything<br/>&gt; else) let us consider the TRIAD C-E-G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wasn&apos;t in the natural harmonic system the triad the<br/>&gt; pertinent feature?  Mean-tone concentrates on the single<br/>&gt; and unique interval of the major third.  But the music<br/>&gt; under consideration proceeds via the harmonies of chords.<br/>&gt; Within mean-tone, the overall purity of C-E-G can be<br/>&gt; &quot;improved&quot;, in analogy to the step of improvement that<br/>&gt; went from the Pythagorean third to the &quot;better&quot;<br/>&gt; mean-tone third.</p><p>Again, Herbert-Anton, when discussing historical tunings,<br/>the idea of &quot;improving&quot; an interval must be considered in<br/>light of the harmonic/contrapuntal theory and practice<br/>of the time under consideration.  I suggest using caution.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Despite its pure third, the mesotonic triad will BEAT.<br/>&gt; To get things &quot;purer&quot;, shouldn&apos;t one attempt to reduce<br/>&gt; the beats? These triads beat: not because of the third<br/>&gt; that is pure, but due to the fifth C-G.  This is one of<br/>&gt; the 4 fifths that has to be necessarily tempered smaller<br/>&gt; in order to fit into its perfect third.  As the triad<br/>&gt; beats anyway, does it really make sense to insist on a<br/>&gt; pure third? Obviously, NO! and the third may be relaxed,<br/>&gt; up to the order of its beat-rate becoming comparable to<br/>&gt; the rapidity of beats of the fifth. Enlarging the third<br/>&gt; somewhat will slow down the beats of the fifth. The ideal<br/>&gt; &quot;meeting/compromise point&quot; will be the situation in which<br/>&gt; - within a tempered triad - both its principal constituent<br/>&gt; intervals third and fifth beat at the UNISON. What sufficient<br/>&gt; reason could produce a BETTER COMPROMISE??<br/>&gt;                        ******************</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve already noted here (and would think that you&apos;d<br/>agree) that *many* other considerations (numerological,<br/>theological, etc.) may go into a person&apos;s preference for a<br/>particular tuning, besides simply the obvious acoustical ones.</p><p>Note also that 1/4-comma meantone, the type you describe<br/>here, where the &quot;5th&quot; is calculated as ( (3/2) / (81/80)^(1/4) )<br/>= ~696.5784285 cents (nearly identical to 31-EDO), was only<br/>one early solution.  Its &quot;major 3rd&quot; is of course the 5:4<br/>ratio = ~386.3137139 cents.  Its &quot;whole-tone&quot; is ~193.1568569<br/>cents, which is *precisely* the mean between the 9:8 and 10:9<br/>ratios. This is the only tuning which can be labeled *exactly*<br/>as &quot;mesotonic&quot;.</p><p>But while 1/4-comma meantone was indeed very popular during the<br/>1500s and 1600s, it was far from being the exclusive &quot;meantone&quot;<br/>tuning employed.</p><p>By the mid-1600s 1/4-comma had fallen out of general favor and was<br/>usually replaced by 1/6-comma meantone or its equivalent 55-EDO:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Sauveur ... said the 55 division was &quot;the one which ordinary<br/>&gt;&gt; musicians use&quot; [Sauveur 1711, p 315].<br/>&gt;&gt; ...<br/>&gt;&gt; Sauveur&apos;s remarks when taken together with other pertinent<br/>&gt;&gt; evidence [from p 54, regarding 1/5-comma meantone; see<br/>&gt;&gt; quote below] suggest that the 1/4-comma temperament is not<br/>&gt;&gt; the most valid model for a menatone system of his day.<br/>&gt;&gt; It had been the theorists&apos; favourite model, however, during<br/>&gt;&gt; the period between Zarlino&apos;s _Dimostrationi harmoniche_<br/>&gt;&gt; (1570) and Mersenne&apos; _Harmonie Universelle_ (1637), and<br/>&gt;&gt; presumably it was used a good deal during that period, even<br/>&gt;&gt; though one writer said in 1613 [Cerone 1613, p 1049] that<br/>&gt;&gt; master organ builders used a meantone temperament with the<br/>&gt;&gt; major 3rds larger than pure.&quot;  [Lindly/Turner-Smith 1993, p 149]</p><p>In 1/6-comma meantone the &quot;5th&quot; is calculated as<br/>( (3/2) / (81/80)^(1/6) ) = ~698.3706193 cents<br/>(nearly identical to 55-EDO... see<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm</a>&gt;).<br/>The &quot;major 3rd&quot; of 1/6-comma meantone = ~393.4824771 cents,<br/>or ~7.168763199 cents wider than that of 1/4-comma meantone<br/>(which is the &quot;pure&quot; 5:4).  Under certain conditions this<br/>could be an audible difference.</p><p>The 55-EDO &quot;5th&quot; is 2^(32/55) = ~698.1818182 cents.  Its<br/>&quot;major 3rd&quot; is 2^(18/55) = ~392.7272727 cents, and its<br/>&quot;whole-tone&quot; is 2^(9/55) = ~196.3636364 cents.</p><p>I have not done any beat-calculations or listening tests to<br/>determine how 1/6-comma meantone or 55-EDO beats; perhaps<br/>you or someone else could calculate and post results.</p><p>&gt; Conclusion: the basis of musical progressions - in<br/>&gt; some sense - are chords and not just intervals. This is<br/>&gt; borne out when basing the music upon triads, the most<br/>&gt; elementary cords. And here, the major chord - trias<br/>&gt; harmonica perfecta.

Both of these values fall nearly<br/>midway between those of the 1/4-comma and 1/6-comma<br/>meantones, with &quot;wohltermperirt&quot; a bit close to the former<br/>than to the latter.</p><p>&gt; Ad 2)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Margo Schulter:]<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) Similarly, while Zarlino&apos;s concept of _harmonia perfetta_<br/>&gt; &gt; is central to late 16th-century practice, does it necessarily<br/>&gt; &gt; favor one specific meantone tuning?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having said the above, I can see nothing in Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; concept of &quot;harmonia perfetta&quot;, that would favor any one<br/>&gt; specific meantone tuning. The mesotonic system definitely<br/>&gt; gives room for improvement, technologically/mathematically<br/>&gt; and spiritually under the musico-theological aspects, perhaps<br/>&gt; best enounced in almost all of Werckmeister&apos;s writings.</p><p>But Zarlino himself advocated 2/7-comma meantone earlier than,<br/>and as superior to, 1/4-comma!  I quote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;... the oldest quantitatively coherent account of a meantone<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament is Zarlino&apos;s description (1558) of a tuning in<br/>&gt;&gt; which the major (and minor) 3rds are smaller than pure<br/>&gt;&gt; by 1/7 of the syntonic comma, and so the 5ths are tempered<br/>&gt;&gt; by 2/7 comma ...<br/>&gt;&gt; In 1571 Zarlino published a scheme which several later<br/>&gt;&gt; theorists took as their only model of meantone temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; (although by the end of the 17th century, it may have been<br/>&gt;&gt; used less than tunings with the major 3rds tempered larger<br/>&gt;&gt; than pure) ...<br/>&gt;&gt; But Zarlino through the 1570s and &apos;80s still liked the sound<br/>&gt;&gt; of his original 2/7-comma meantone temperament as well...<br/>&gt;&gt; Near the other limit which we have determined for a meantone<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament lies this possibility: [1/6-comma meantone].<br/>&gt;&gt; And there is an obvious intermediate possibility [1/5-comma<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone]... Sauveur preferred it to any other kind of system,<br/>&gt;&gt; and Louli&iuml;&iquest;&half; in 1698 [Louli&iuml;&iquest;&half; 1698, p 28] said it was more in<br/>&gt;&gt; use than any other.&quot;  [Lindley/Turner-Smith 1993, p 52-54]</p><p>The 2/7-comma &quot;5th&quot; is ~695.8103467 cents, and the &quot;major 3rd&quot; is<br/>~383.2413868 cents.

To get<br/>things<br/>&gt; &quot;purer&quot;, shouldn&apos;t one attempt to reduce the beats? These triads<br/>&gt; beat: not because of the third that is pure, but due to the fifth C-<br/>G.<br/>&gt; This is one of the 4 fifths that has to be necessarily tempered<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; in order to fit into its perfect third.<br/>&gt; As the triad beats anyway, does it really make sense to insist on a<br/>pure<br/>&gt; third? Obviously, NO! and the third may be relaxed, up to the order<br/>&gt; of its beat-rate becoming comparable to the rapidity of beats of<br/>&gt; the fifth. Enlarging the third somewhat will slow down the beats of<br/>the<br/>&gt; fifth. The ideal &quot;meeting/compromise point&quot; will be the situation<br/>&gt; in which - within a tempered triad - both its principal constituent<br/>&gt; intervals third and fifth beat at the UNISON. What sufficient<br/>reason could<br/>&gt; produce a BETTER COMPROMISE??<br/>&gt;           ******************<br/>&gt;<br/>........</p><p>The concept of the ideal &quot;trias harmonica perfecta&quot; being realized by<br/>a regular temperament where the _beat rate_ of the 5th of the major<br/>triad is identical to that of the major 3rd has compeling<br/>philosophical appeal.  It chould be appreciated that 1/5-(syntonic)<br/>comma meantone, which results in a 1/5-comma error in both of these<br/>intervals (5th narrowed, 3rd widened) does _not_ produce equal beat<br/>rates.  The primary beat of the 5th is produces by the 3rd harmonic<br/>of the lower tone against the 2nd of the upper, whereas that of the<br/>major 3rd is the 5th harmonic of the lower against the 4th of the<br/>upper.</p><p>Herein follows the derivation of the degree of temperament for this<br/>case:</p><p>Let f(1), f(2) and f(3) be the frequencies of the triad tones in<br/>increasing order.  Then:</p><p>     B(5) = 3*f(1) - 2*f(3)</p><p>where B(5) is the beat rate of the 5th.  Likewise:</p><p>     B(3) = 4*f(2) - 5*F(1)</p><p>where B(3) is the beat rate of the 3rd.  Setting B(5) =  B(3) yields:</p><p>     3*f(1) - 2*f(3) = 4*f(2) - 5*f(1).</p><p>Collecting terms and transposing:</p><p>     8*f(1) = 4*f(2) + 2*f(3).</p><p>Dividing each term by f(1) yields:</p><p>     8 = 4*R(3) + 2*R(5)                    [1]</p><p>where R(3) equals the frequency ratio of the 3rd, f(2)/f(1); and R(5)<br/>that of the 5th, f(3)/f(1).</p><p>Using the regular temperament definition for the major 3rd as four<br/>ascending 5ths reduced by two octaves, we have:</p><p>     R(3) = R(5)^4/4.</p><p>Substituting into [1]:</p><p>     8 = R(5)^4 + 2*R(5)</p><p>which can be rewritten as the quartic polynomial equation:</p><p>     x^4 + 2*x - 8 = 0.</p><p>An iterative numerical solution quickly converges to yield:</p><p>     x = 1.4959535....</p><p>Converting to an equivalent portion of a syntonic comma:</p><p>     T = ln(1.5/1.49595535)/ln(81/80) = 0.2175428.... ,</p><p>a value between 1/4 comma (0.25) and 1/5 comma (0.20).
