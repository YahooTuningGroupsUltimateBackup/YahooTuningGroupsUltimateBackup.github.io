<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Making music (in case you're interested)</h1><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2001 1:47:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny Reinhard put me in touch with someone who heard my microtonal<br/>music on WNYC and liked it. This person really liked the other<br/>microtonal piece of mine that I was able to immediately share with<br/>him, and I am now ready to kidnap my erstwhile keyboard player Ara<br/>(it&apos;s not Ira) in order to try to record decent performances of a<br/>bunch of pieces.</p><p>I had a fun visit with Joseph Pehrson today. He had the blackjack<br/>tuning set up on his keyboard, and I showed him some chord<br/>progressions I&apos;d been playing around with (though with none of the<br/>rhythmic conviction I had at home :)). He immediately asked me how I<br/>would notate the music . . .</p><p>I guess the fact that notation is unimportant to me reflects the fact<br/>that I am an improvising musician. My main musical skill is my<br/>ability to jump into almost any musical situation, immediately hear<br/>the chord progression, improvise in a stylistically appropriate and<br/>emotionally expressive manner. When I don&apos;t know which chords are<br/>coming next, I somehow manage to continue to play melodically<br/>coherent and interesting phrases that will flow over the bar line and<br/>allow me to complete them appropriately in the split second it takes<br/>me to register which chord is being played. I suppose I developed<br/>this skill through endless hours jamming along with the radio, as<br/>well as a few classes in classical counterpoint. Also, I seem to be<br/>able to construct solo improvisations on guitar or piano that will<br/>keep myself and others interested for extended periods of time.</p><p>Notated music is anathema to all this magic for me. If I need to<br/>learn a part, I&apos;ll learn it by ear. This is usually very easy for me.<br/>I only notate when working with, say, a flute player or a saxophone<br/>player who is better at reading than at hearing and memorizing. If I<br/>need to create a form, I&apos;ll write it out, but usually end up revising<br/>it endlessly -- never satisfied. As you might expect, composing is a<br/>grueling process for me, as music comes most naturally to me when the<br/>composing, the performing, and the hearing are virtually simultaneous.</p><p>Sorry for all this rambling about myself. I guess, since I&apos;ve posted<br/>so much for over five years, I wanted to let those who didn&apos;t know,<br/>know where I&apos;m coming from musically. I try to create environments<br/>for myself (and others) to improvise in, where the theoretical<br/>considerations (as Daniel Wolf pointed out, even free improvisers<br/>operate with an overwhelming amount of theory, conscious or<br/>otherwise) lead the improviser to mutations of, or varying degrees of<br/>departure from, existing styles.</p><p>One aspect of &quot;traditional&quot; styles I&apos;m usually preserving is the<br/>contrast between consonance and dissonance, and another is coherent<br/>melody. In a sense, I make music for my nine-year-old self who hadn&apos;t<br/>yet developed the ability to hear a chord progression and know<br/>exactly what it was. There was still mystery in a Madonna song. As I<br/>see it, having greater musical knowledge shouldn&apos;t lead the musician<br/>to a world where he/she makes music only for other musicians. One<br/>needs to keep alive the innocent child within, for many reasons, one<br/>of which is to be able to hear and feel music the way others are<br/>likely to.</p><p>But I don&apos;t think that the music has to be in 12-tone equal<br/>temperament, or even be diatonic (though that&apos;s a tougher one to get<br/>away from), to communicate in this direct way. I played my solo 22-<br/>tET guitar piece for a professional guitarist friend, and even though<br/>one of the voices descends through six consecutive 22-tET pitches, he<br/>thought it sounded &quot;normal&quot; (i.e., not microtonal). I think that&apos;s<br/>because the line was melodically smooth and the chords were simple<br/>harmonic-series (I mean approximately) subsets which connected<br/>through common tones. If that makes music sound &quot;not microtonal&quot;,<br/>then I don&apos;t want to be microtonal (though what else would you call<br/>playing six consecutive 22-tET pitches?)!</p><p>Having a near-daily experience of entertaining people with music, and<br/>validation of non-12-tET through experiences such as this, poses an<br/>immediately &quot;practical&quot; engineering problem: how to create pitch sets<br/>with potential for melodic coherence, and with lots of approximate-<br/>harmonic-series subsets connectable through common tones. It&apos;s<br/>engineering, not science. The MIRACLE scales were but one (although,<br/>it turned out, a very special one in many ways) way to build a bridge<br/>over this particular river. That&apos;s all -- no greek letters, no<br/>elaborate experimental set-ups, just a simple goal and a nice way of<br/>achieving that goal.</p><p>It&apos;s not science. But it sure is mathematical. One can proceed simply<br/>by trial and error forever. Or one can observe patterns, elevate some<br/>patterns to the status of theorems while others remain hypotheses for<br/>the time being, and prune the infinite trial-and-error tree to<br/>manageable proportions. All of this requires constant validation by<br/>the inner nine-year-old&apos;s ears. If the inner nine-year-old likes the<br/>scale that&apos;s not maximally even better than the one that&apos;s maximally<br/>even, or the one that&apos;s improper better than the one that&apos;s proper,<br/>then you can be sure that I&apos;m not going to be pruning the branches<br/>from my tree in the way that these abstract concepts might suggest.</p><p>The history of musical tuning systems throughout the world cannot be<br/>irrelevant to this process. If my inner child does in fact represent<br/>the way most people hear, then my engineering paradigms should lead<br/>naturally to many tuning systems that were actually used in practice<br/>for making music that people liked. If the actual, practical tuning<br/>systems are excluded, then I know I&apos;m ignoring a whole lot of &quot;inner<br/>children&quot; -- and this is unwise.</p><p>So the engineering process becomes a time-consuming activity unto<br/>itself, involving a great deal of information gathering and<br/>exchanging with others. This has been one of the wonderful benefits<br/>of this list -- bringing together a huge pool of knowledge and<br/>experience into one place. And it&apos;s not a purely selfish activity --<br/>many composers and improvisers with similar aesthetic goals have<br/>benefitted, are benefitting, and will benefit from the new ideas, and<br/>critiques and reiterations of old ideas, that are the results of this<br/>process.</p><p>Where the process gets mathematical, some feel it becomes anathema to<br/>music-making. They must feel the way I do when presented with notated<br/>music, or with the requirement to notate my music. So to better<br/>coexist with such individuals, I have created the tuning-math list,<br/>where the engineering and meta-engineering (i.e., theory) work has<br/>continued, and may more fully migrate in the coming days. But<br/>hopefully such individuals who have read this far will better<br/>understand why I am pursuing these &quot;mathematical machinations&quot; to the<br/>extent that I am. The goals really very simple, and visceral, and the<br/>ends served are not abstract or elitist in the slightest. It&apos;s the<br/>force of the response I get from the average music-listener that made<br/>me decide not to be a physicist (got a degree and went no further),<br/>but instead apply my mathematical skills to music (and to the part-<br/>time job that pays my rent right now).</p><p>If anyone thinks I&apos;m foolish, or I&apos;ve made fundamental (or other)<br/>errors in reasoning or judgment, or has any other critical comments,<br/>I&apos;m more than willing to listen and consider their arguments<br/>carefully. If anyone feels hurt, maligned, alienated, ignored, angry,<br/>or otherwise negatively about anything in this message or anything<br/>I&apos;ve written here in the past that has gone unaddressed, please do<br/>share these feelings with me -- I can be naive sometimes but you&apos;ll<br/>find I&apos;m very sympathetic. All right, I&apos;m tired . . . until later!</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/28/2001 6:33:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23885">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23885</a></p><p>Thanks so much, Paul, for expressing your motivations for<br/>constructing chord progressions, and the like, for the MIRACLE family<br/>and for other scales!</p><p>I never thought about it being an &quot;engineering&quot; problem rather than<br/>a &quot;scientific&quot; one... very interesting.</p><p>In any case, of course, I will be very intrigued with what you come<br/>up with and, naturally, I am not surprised in the least that it could<br/>involve some mathematics.

Since Indian music is ONLY<br/>improvisation, musicians have not felt the need to notate any Indian<br/>music.  In fact, my guru was vehemently against anything like<br/>notation at all -- he used to say: write music and murder it! However<br/>hard you may try, notation cannot represent Indian music.  Infinite<br/>is the number of possible variations, combinations, phrases, nuances,<br/>shruti ranges in any raga.  I have heard maestros like Sharafat<br/>Hussein Khan singing Bihag for more than three hours, with his<br/>listeners in rapt attention and wanting him to sing more and more.</p><p>Indian music is learnt only by ear.  The notation system can be some<br/>help, like a memory peg, for later revisions , especially for those<br/>compositions that you do not sing often.  It can be some help in<br/>conveying a musical idea to someone who can go behind the notation<br/>and reach the heart of the expression.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2001 2:37:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/28/01 4:47 AM, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In a sense, I make music for my nine-year-old self who hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt; yet developed the ability to hear a chord progression and know<br/>&gt; exactly what it was.
