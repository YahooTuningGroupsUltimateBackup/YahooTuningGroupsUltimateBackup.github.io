So I did an equal-beating 8 up, 3 down; and then a 7 down 4 up<br/>version using this beat rate. Then, I kind of brushed up the A-flat and E major triad<br/>relationship, to make them both usable....it was quite easy actually. It sounded<br/>functionally like an equal-beating 1/6 or 1/7 comma-meantone, and/or like a kind-of<br/>intuited Young well-temperament, and was warm and interesting. It had the same<br/>general qualities of which keys are more active, etc., that Werkmeister does. I<br/>think that my hypothesis would be that these kind of ad-hoc &apos;utility tunings&apos;<br/>happened more often than not during the 19th century, and, they have the added<br/>bonus of being easy to tune. In other words, it was close enough that most ears<br/>wouldn&apos;t be able to tell the difference in performance (would any ears?) between it,<br/>and a mathematically fussy and theoretically correct well-temperament.</p><p>&lt;blasphemy&gt; In fact, there is nothing whatsoever special about that particular beat<br/>rate---one could choose any slow enough beat rate and have an arbitrary, usable<br/>well-temperament by following the general principle of &apos;7 down, 4 up&apos; or<br/>what-have-you. &lt;/blasphemy&gt;</p><p>I hear the rebuttal: how do instrumentalists find the notes when playing with the<br/>keyboard? I reply: how did they find it when there was NO standard western<br/>tuning?</p><p>An interesting aside: when you tune a theoretically correct 1/4 comma meantone,<br/>and half THAT beat rate, and do an equally-beating well-temperament, you get a<br/>remarkably close 12-tet approximation. Try it in Scala sometime.....</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=47091 href="#47091">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2003 2:22:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akj@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An open question I&apos;m exploring is: How mathematically precise a<br/>&gt;historical<br/>&gt; temperament needs to be in practice to be usable and have the<br/>&gt;general qualities<br/>&gt; ascribe to and need for 18th and 19th century music in well-<br/>&gt;tempered tunings?<br/>&gt; My answer: not very.</p><p>agreed.</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; think that my hypothesis would be that these kind of ad-<br/>&gt;hoc &apos;utility tunings&apos;<br/>&gt; happened more often than not during the 19th century,</p><p>agreed again. jorgensen&apos;s _tuning_ tome details plenty of these kinds<br/>of historically documented ad-hoc strategies, and often supplies<br/>precise numerical tables for each *just by way of example*. some<br/>critics of jorgensen that have been quoted here have completely<br/>ignored the text and gone on to rail against the precision of the<br/>numerical tables. they should read the text.</p><p>a nice paper you might want to read, which intelligently argues<br/>against the over-application of certain anachronistically<br/>precise, &quot;stock&quot; temperaments commonly found on keyboards and tuners,<br/>while making other points which will surely interest you, is:</p><p><a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/paulpoletti/T4D.PDF">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/paulpoletti/T4D.PDF</a></p><p>&gt; An interesting aside: when you tune a theoretically correct 1/4<br/>&gt;comma meantone,<br/>&gt; and half THAT beat rate, and do an equally-beating well-<br/>&gt;temperament, you get a<br/>&gt; remarkably close 12-tet approximation.</p><p>wouldn&apos;t that depend on where the original fifth lies within your<br/>bearing compass?</p></div><h3><a id=47092 href="#47092">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/19/2003 3:31:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 9/19/03 5:24:29 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:perlich@aya.yale.edu">perlich@aya.yale.edu</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; An open question I&apos;m exploring is: How mathematically precise a<br/>&gt; &gt;historical<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament needs to be in practice to be usable and have the<br/>&gt; &gt;general qualities<br/>&gt; &gt; ascribe to and need for 18th and 19th century music in well-<br/>&gt; &gt;tempered tunings?<br/>&gt; &gt; My answer: not very.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; agreed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Question, How mathematically precise does equal temperament need to be in<br/>practice to be usable?</p><p>also not very, and it will have the natural quality generally ascribed to<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>Johnny</p></div><h3><a id=47093 href="#47093">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
