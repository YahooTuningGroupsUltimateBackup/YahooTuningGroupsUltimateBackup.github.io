Has it ever been suggested to you that<br/>&gt; &gt; you try to describe the maqamat as periodicity blocks?  I<br/>&gt; &gt; think that would be a very interesting paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are periodicity blocks in layman&apos;s terms?</p><p>They are scales in just intonation.  Actually they are more<br/>like scale archetypes, as usually a number of different but<br/>related scales can be said to come from the same periodicity<br/>block.  They are also archetypes of temperaments in a way,<br/>as each periodicity block suggests by its nature ways it may<br/>be tempered.  In my view, they are the foundation of the<br/>theory of regular temperaments.</p><p>What they actually are: sections (&quot;blocks&quot;) of a JI lattice<br/>that are bounded by commas (small intervals).  By bounded,<br/>we mean these intervals do not occur between any two notes<br/>in the block.  For example, 81/80 does not occur in the<br/>diatonic scale 1/1 9/8/ 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1.  However,<br/>if we add 10/9, which is adjacent to 5/3 and 4/3 on the<br/>lattice, then 9/8 - 10/9 = 81/80, and 81/80 will occur as<br/>a scale step (&quot;second&quot;) in our scale.</p><p>Not only are the blocks bounded in this way, it is usually<br/>the case that no seconds of the scale are smaller than these<br/>bounding intervals.  If the diatonic scale had an interval<br/>smaller than 81/80, why not include 81/80 too?</p><p>Scala actually has built-in tools for dealing with periodicity<br/>blocks, but I haven&apos;t tried to learn how to use them yet.</p><p>For more information, consult Paul Erlich&apos;s excellent<br/>tutorial:<br/><a href="http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/f/fokker-gentle-1.aspx">http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/f/fokker-gentle-1.aspx</a></p><p>Generally it is a good setup for the kind of paper I suggest<br/>if someone who knows the maqamat but not periodicity blocks<br/>supplies a list of maqamat in just intonation.  And then<br/>the other person attempts to describe them in terms of<br/>periodicity blocks.  :)   But the maqamat are mysterious<br/>things, and you may have an easier time learning about<br/>periodicity blocks than I will about maqamat.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>George D.

Its &quot;Tonespace&quot; files in fact simply<br/>*are* periodicity-blocks, from which &quot;Tuning&quot; files<br/>are generated.</p><p>A periodicity-block is essentially a unit-cell,<br/>which tiles the whole tonespace, similar to the<br/>way that in a crystal structure there is a unit-cell<br/>which is repeated over and over again in all three<br/>dimensions. However, a periodicity-block can have<br/>as many boundaries as there are dimensions in the<br/>tonespace, it&apos;s not restricted to 3.</p><p>Near the bottom of my 12-edo page, i have a graphic<br/>showing a bingo-card lattice of 12-edo with many<br/>of the different possible periodicity-blocks outlined<br/>in green:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/12edo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/12edo.aspx</a></p><p>Note that in order to create a periodicity-block,<br/>the number of unison-vectors must equal the number<br/>of dimensions in the tonespace. If there are less<br/>unison-vectors (but at least one), there will still<br/>be periodicity in the tonespace, but some dimensions<br/>will be open-ended (infinite) -- thus, for example:</p><p>In classic 5-limit meantone, the full tonespace has<br/>3 dimensions, representing prime-factors 2, 3, and 5.<br/>Assuming the normal identity-interval of ratio 2/1,<br/>we may ignore 2 and use a 2-dimensional prime-space<br/>representing factors 3 and 5. If there is only one<br/>unison-vector and it is the syntonic-comma, whose<br/>ratio is 81/80 and 2,3,5-monzo is [-4 4, -1&gt;, then<br/>one boundary of periodicity will be a vector which<br/>can be expressed in classic vector form as &lt;4i-j&gt;<br/>where i is the 3-axis and j is the 5-axis -- thus<br/>the vector extends to a point which is 4 positive<br/>steps along the 3-axis and one negative step along<br/>the 5-axis. This single unison-vector thus creates<br/>a slightly angled &quot;periodicity-slice&quot; across the<br/>2-dimensional prime-space. If 3 is the horizontal<br/>axis and 5 is the vertical, the periodicity-slice<br/>will go from the upper-right to the lower-left, and<br/>all pitches further to the left or right are considered<br/>equivalent to those within the slice. But the slice<br/>will extend infinitely on the top and bottom.</p><p>If a second unison-vector is used, then a periodicity-block<br/>will be formed, with the top and bottom boundaries being<br/>the vector of the syntonic-comma itself, and the left<br/>and right boundaries being the second unison-vector.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@telesonique.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2007 1:56:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On second thought, I find 46-equal too radical a temperament for the<br/>&gt; traditionalists who will likely opt for something more<br/>&gt; &quot;Pythagorean&quot;.

Its &quot;Tonespace&quot; files in fact simply<br/>&gt; *are* periodicity-blocks, from which &quot;Tuning&quot; files<br/>&gt; are generated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A periodicity-block is essentially a unit-cell,<br/>&gt; which tiles the whole tonespace, similar to the<br/>&gt; way that in a crystal structure there is a unit-cell<br/>&gt; which is repeated over and over again in all three<br/>&gt; dimensions. However, a periodicity-block can have<br/>&gt; as many boundaries as there are dimensions in the<br/>&gt; tonespace, it&apos;s not restricted to 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Near the bottom of my 12-edo page, i have a graphic<br/>&gt; showing a bingo-card lattice of 12-edo with many<br/>&gt; of the different possible periodicity-blocks outlined<br/>&gt; in green:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/12edo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/12edo.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that in order to create a periodicity-block,<br/>&gt; the number of unison-vectors must equal the number<br/>&gt; of dimensions in the tonespace. If there are less<br/>&gt; unison-vectors (but at least one), there will still<br/>&gt; be periodicity in the tonespace, but some dimensions<br/>&gt; will be open-ended (infinite) -- thus, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In classic 5-limit meantone, the full tonespace has<br/>&gt; 3 dimensions, representing prime-factors 2, 3, and 5.<br/>&gt; Assuming the normal identity-interval of ratio 2/1,<br/>&gt; we may ignore 2 and use a 2-dimensional prime-space<br/>&gt; representing factors 3 and 5. If there is only one<br/>&gt; unison-vector and it is the syntonic-comma, whose<br/>&gt; ratio is 81/80 and 2,3,5-monzo is [-4 4, -1&gt;, then<br/>&gt; one boundary of periodicity will be a vector which<br/>&gt; can be expressed in classic vector form as &lt;4i-j&gt;<br/>&gt; where i is the 3-axis and j is the 5-axis -- thus<br/>&gt; the vector extends to a point which is 4 positive<br/>&gt; steps along the 3-axis and one negative step along<br/>&gt; the 5-axis. This single unison-vector thus creates<br/>&gt; a slightly angled &quot;periodicity-slice&quot; across the<br/>&gt; 2-dimensional prime-space. If 3 is the horizontal<br/>&gt; axis and 5 is the vertical, the periodicity-slice<br/>&gt; will go from the upper-right to the lower-left, and<br/>&gt; all pitches further to the left or right are considered<br/>&gt; equivalent to those within the slice. But the slice<br/>&gt; will extend infinitely on the top and bottom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a second unison-vector is used, then a periodicity-block<br/>&gt; will be formed, with the top and bottom boundaries being<br/>&gt; the vector of the syntonic-comma itself, and the left<br/>&gt; and right boundaries being the second unison-vector.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2007 4:13:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That is all very well, but what about a Halberstadt-like keyboard as in the<br/>SCALA chromatic clavier?</p><p>Oz.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Herman Miller&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@IO.COM">hmiller@IO.COM</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 18 Eyl&iuml;&iquest;&half;l 2007 Sal&iuml;&iquest;&half; 4:45<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: 46-equal</p><p>&gt; Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hstraub64@telesonique.net">hstraub64@telesonique.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: 17 Eyl&iuml;&iquest;&half;l 2007 Pazartesi 23:56<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: 46-equal<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On second thought, I find 46-equal too radical a temperament for the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; traditionalists who will likely opt for something more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Pythagorean&quot;.

The point of a periodicity-block<br/>&gt; is that any ratio outside the periodicity-block is<br/>&gt; considered to be equivalent to a ratio inside the<br/>&gt; block which lies at the distance of a unison-vector<br/>&gt; from the ratio outside the block. Thus, in this case,<br/>&gt; 5/3 and 27/16 are considered to be the same note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s going on here is obvious in the case of temperaments,<br/>&gt; because in a meantone temperament (for example), 5/3 and<br/>&gt; 27/16 really *are* the same note. It might not seem to make<br/>&gt; as much sense for JI, but my opinion is that the<br/>&gt; periodicity-block concept is important for our conception<br/>&gt; of scales and other tuning structures. Some JI scales will<br/>&gt; recognize the syntonic-comma and others will not -- those<br/>&gt; that do not will follow the principles embedded in the<br/>&gt; example periodicity-blocks we&apos;re discussing here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some time ago, i had updated my Encyclopedia page about<br/>&gt; &quot;pythagorean&quot;, and included new graphics near the beginning<br/>&gt; which illustrate how the age-old pythagorean scales are<br/>&gt; derived from unison-vectors and periodicity-blocks:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/pythagorean.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/pythagorean.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (In this case, they&apos;re not really blocks, but just<br/>&gt; line-segments, but &quot;periodicity-block&quot; has been taken,<br/>&gt; by most tuning theorists who bother with the concept, to<br/>&gt; be a generic term representing any closed periodic shape.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Aaron K.

The whole idea is that the vector which<br/>&gt; connects a pitch inside the periodicity-block with<br/>&gt; one outside of it represents the concept that both<br/>&gt; pitches are a unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Enharmonic&quot; had a much older meaning, from ancient<br/>&gt; Greek times. The word &quot;enharmonic&quot; actually means<br/>&gt; &quot;properly attuned&quot;, but as a genus it implies a<br/>&gt; scale with some notes which are approximately a<br/>&gt; quarter-tone apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;enharmonic-diesis&quot; arose within the context of<br/>&gt; 5-limit JI and meantone, and represents the interval<br/>&gt; between pairs of notes notated as, for example, Ab<br/>&gt; and G#. In the case of JI and 1/4-comma meantone it<br/>&gt; is the same: ~41.06 cents.

I know it&apos;s coming, so I can&apos;t be fully<br/>&gt; &gt; out there listening.</p><p>For quick relief, try the two 34-tone files.  :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I would be very interested to hear others&apos; reactions.</p><p>[Exit Carl; enter Aaron:]</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t listened tothe page yet, but---<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; re:53 vs. 46, wouldn&apos;t there be some advantage to having a prime<br/>&gt; numbered n-tet (e.g. complete circulation)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose one can get off, musically on the &quot;switching gears&quot;<br/>effect of<br/>&gt; 46=2x23, but what else is virtuous.</p><p>46 has some nice melodic properties and better consistency: 53 is<br/>only 9-limit consistent, while 46 is 13-limit consistent (strictly<br/>speaking, although its inconsistency at the 17-limit is so slight as<br/>to be practically nonexistent).</p><p>Now if you had asked about 34, I&apos;d have plenty to say.  It&apos;s the best<br/>5-limit division below 46, and it has many of the general<br/>characteristics of 46 as well (wide 5ths, similar melodic properties,<br/>17-limit capability).  A big plus is that 34 gives you pajara (with,<br/>arguably, the optimal pajara tuning via well-temperament).  34-ET<br/>isn&apos;t quite 17-limit consistent (due to the 7th harmonic), however,<br/>my 34-WT overcomes this deficiency in the best pajara keys.  You also<br/>get some other scale structures, such as keemun and sentinel (a non-5<br/>scale subset of 17-ET I discovered a couple decades ago; I saw that<br/>name for it in Scala, although I don&apos;t know where Manuel got it).<br/>One big problem with 34 is that you can&apos;t map it on a Bosanquet<br/>generalized keyboard -- however, not many people have one of those,<br/>anyway (yet)!</p><p>&gt; Regarding numbers of notes, when they are that high to begin with,<br/>&gt; piling a few extra doesn&apos;t make a difference, except from the point<br/>of<br/>&gt; view of live acoustic instuments with fixed pitch set (guitar<br/>frets,<br/>&gt; keyboard keys). electronics and trombone and voice, and so on, pose<br/>no<br/>&gt; limit, and I gather that these edos are just theory at that point<br/>to<br/>&gt; such instruments, unless you are performing with a synth backing<br/>track<br/>&gt; like Toby Twining does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of the attractions of 19 in spite of its less than stellar<br/>&gt; approximations is that it&apos;s easily done with current resources, and<br/>its<br/>&gt; different enough in a very obvioous way.</p><p>IMO, well-temperaments give you more bang for the buck.  Compare the<br/>Exmp19p3.mid file at the above link with the ones for 19- and 31-<br/>equal.</p><p>&gt; 53 on acoustic instruments really deosn&apos;t exist---it just becomes<br/>&gt; adaptive JI, let&apos;s face it, with all the error in cents that<br/>acoustic<br/>&gt; instruments will bring to it. I would say that without synth<br/>backing<br/>&gt; tracks, 31 or 34 might be the upper limit of what acoustic<br/>instruments<br/>&gt; could do with any accuracy or meaning.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s pretty much what I thought back in the 1970&apos;s, although I<br/>allowed that the extreme upper limit for acoustic instruments might<br/>be 41.  (It takes almost that many tones of the miracle temperament<br/>to play my tuning example, which doesn&apos;t even modulate.  And, yes,<br/>there is a Stud-loco example, ExmpMrcl.mid, out there, using the<br/>minimax generator.)</p><p>One thing I was after, back then, was a near-just 13-limit otonal<br/>tuning that allowed more than a minimal amount of modulation with a<br/>reasonable number of tones.  As far as I knew it didn&apos;t exist, so I<br/>created one (in 29 tones) that, in 6 different keys, is closer to JI<br/>than any EDO below 130 and has some great melodic properties.  A midi<br/>example (Exmp29HT.mid) is out there (transposable to 4 other keys<br/>without losing accuracy).  You don&apos;t get the totally free modulation<br/>of an ET, but you can modulate over all 29 keys if you&apos;re willing to<br/>accept (and exploit) variable intonation.  I also have a 17-tone<br/>version of this tuning in 3 excellent keys (not a subset of the 29<br/>tones, however), to which I tuned a 2-2/3-octave set of tubulongs;<br/>it&apos;s not JI, but it&apos;s very close.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2007 2:44:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Neither 3:1 or 3:2 are frequencies.

I just have to edit the synth&apos;s sounds to get<br/>two identical sounds that differ only in the octave range and assign<br/>the higher sounding one to the lower part of the keyboard and the<br/>lower one to the higher part of the keyboard. Then I can play up to 24<br/>tones per octave. This is how I managed to compose a piece for the<br/>midwest microfest and also for the seventeen tone piano project.</p><p>For more than 24 tones per octave, the same procedure applies - you<br/>just need another keyboard, such as the Kaway MP5, which supports 4<br/>split areas.
