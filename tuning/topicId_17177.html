Has this<br/>&gt; ever been done?</p><p>Bass strings, yes. We adjust the lengths of the un-, or less wound<br/>sections at the ends of bass strings at the design stage of<br/>scaling/rescaling to tailor inharmonicity. Partly this is for effect,<br/>but far more often better to match the less adjustable plain wire at<br/>change-overs and to even out variations in the original. Here, a shorter<br/>length between the end of the winding and terminations predicts results<br/>of lower inharmonicity (alias, higher harmonicity - also, overall<br/>length, core wire size and tension affect this). Dave Sanderson holds a<br/>patent for additional nonlinear loading, I think in the form of &apos;bumps&apos;<br/>or thickened winding at the bridge end. As to nearly harmonic partials,<br/>his father Albert (I think who developed the standard bass string<br/>inharmonicity formula, along with the Sanderson Accutuner family) wrote<br/>that his experiments made alien and lifeless sounding strings, but I<br/>really prefer the more harmonic, nearly organ-like sound of old<br/>Chickering scales to the more bell-like Steinway type.

Now I really wish I<br/>could run some numbers thru a finite element program.  It strikes me<br/>that a single &quot;point mass&quot;, x distance from the bridge and y mass,<br/>(x and y to be solved for) could effectively counteract the<br/>inharmonicity of piano strings.  O&apos;course, the strings are VERY close<br/>together once they double and triple up, so could an actual mass be<br/>found that would both fit and make a difference?</p><p>And, from what you&apos;re saying there could be patent issues.  Exactly<br/>what Dave K, was hoping to head off!</p><p>Senior thesis, anyone?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
