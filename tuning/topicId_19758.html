If all sorts of people can<br/>&gt; update the faq entries then different people<br/>&gt; might be changing the same file then they all go<br/>&gt; to put it back and only the last person in gets<br/>&gt; to see his changes. Also, what if the editor makes<br/>&gt; changes to a file, but then the original author<br/>&gt; uploads his old version to which he has been making<br/>&gt; changes? Using SCV control software I think is<br/>&gt; too much to ask the list to learn. A possible solution<br/>&gt; would be that changes and additions to faq entries<br/>&gt; should be routed through the original author or<br/>&gt; his designate (such as the editor). Oh I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt; I  don&apos;t see any easy answer. What do you think?</p><p>Thanks for thinking about this. One needs to look ahead<br/>as much as one can and anticipate problems that might<br/>turn up a fair way into the future.</p><p>I suggest that each person the original author takes<br/>responsibility for the file.</p><p>This will be self working, since files in the files area<br/>can only be edited by the original authors.</p><p>Hi Graham, and Joseph,</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I fully encourage web pages, and will host them at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com">www.microtonal.co.uk</a> if  the author can&apos;t get their own site together.</p><p>&gt; I believe Robert Walker has already established a site for this, but<br/>&gt; I&apos;m certain your offer is greatly appreciated...</p><p>&gt; It looks as thought, Graham, you&apos;re on the side of the &quot;HTML folks&quot;...</p><p>Actually the site the tree is on at present is only suitable for a demo.</p><p>It is the one I get for free with ntlworld. I use it for this sort of<br/>thing because it has easy ftp access, and doesn&apos;t seem to go off-line that<br/>I&apos;ve noticed.</p><p>I&apos;m also thinking of using it for the FTS download page as the bandwidth<br/>limit is a generous two gigabytes / day.</p><p>(download rates can get high if a 1 Mb program is downloaded, and<br/>I had a couple of days last year, immediately after release of<br/>1.082 if I remember right, when it ran to over 100 Mb/day, so this is<br/>a consideration)</p><p>However, the other side of it is that it has a very limited quota for<br/>file storage, not sure how much, but I&apos;ve reached the point where<br/>adding an extra 400 K takes me over the limit, and I&apos;m going to need<br/>to go through and delete files if it is going to be suitable<br/>for the FTS download page.</p><p>So, it is definitely _not_ suitable for anything more than a small demo.</p><p>I have four other free web sites, but none of them are suitable<br/>for one reason or another.</p><p>One has banners, one is often unavailable for ftp up load,<br/>one is almost never available for ftp at all, so that you<br/>need to upload files via a web based form, one is very<br/>close to its quota too, and the last one has a quota on<br/>the number of hits you can get.</p><p>This isn&apos;t a big problem, they work fine for what I need<br/>them for, but they aren&apos;t going to be suitable for the<br/>FAQ.</p><p>However, I wonder, maybe JdL has plans for the web site anyway.</p><p>Makes sense for the keeper of the FAQ to be the one with ftp<br/>access to the web site.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19774 href="#19774">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/4/2001 9:54:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19758.html#19758">/tuning/topicId_19758.html#19758</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Graham, and Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I fully encourage web pages, and will host them at<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com">www.microtonal.co.uk</a> if  the author can&apos;t get their own site<br/>together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually the site the tree is on at present is only suitable for a<br/>demo.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Perhaps Graham has space for such a FAQ tree on his site??
