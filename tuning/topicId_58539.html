For practical purposes, let us refer to this as &grave;half a cent&grave;.</p><p>If we want to raise 440Hz by a mina, the resulting frequency will be 440.11554Hz according to the conversion calculator here:</p><p><a href="http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-centsratio.htm">http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-centsratio.htm</a></p><p>Remember that every 1% change in the frequency will result in 0.5% change in tension. Since the change in frequency is 1 in 4000, the change in tension will be 1 in 2000.</p><p>Thus, the total tension of all three strings should be increased as much as 2000th of a unit of weight, giving us:</p><p>Delta W=300kg/2000</p><p>Delta W=150 grams.</p><p>The Ultratonal Piano (tm) utilizes a technology which can effectively change the string tensions by unit grams.

Imagine spending hours in front of your house piano equipped with this device. The Ultratonal Piano (tm) is matchless for unbounded acoustical tuning.

Simply because, as I have previously shown, the mass per unit<br/>lenght (your M) is equal to (Pi) times (diameter square) times (the density<br/>of the string material) divided by 4.</p><p>In other words:</p><p>             Pi * D^2 * Rho<br/> M=      ___________</p><p>                   4</p><p>Therefore, you see that the mass per unit lenght and the diameter of the<br/>cross sectional area of the string are inherently linked, so that for a<br/>given density:</p><p>If the diameter is changed %1, then the mass per unit lenght is changed by<br/>%2. In mathematical words:</p><p>Delta M          2 Delta D<br/>______   =    ________</p><p>      M                      D</p><p>Delta M being the change in the unit mass, and Delta D being the<br/>corresponding change in the diameter.</p><p>Thus, your relationship:</p><p>W (tension of the string) = 4 (L^2) * (F^2) * M</p><p>is perfectly valid for the first harmonic.</p><p>Here, L is the lenght of the string, F is the frequency achieved applying<br/>the weight W to the string, and M again is the mass per unit lenght.</p><p>Thus, this relationship is not approximate at all; it is identical to the<br/>relationship given by your correspondent:</p><p>T = F^2 * L^2 * D^2 * Pi * Rho,</p><p>assuming that his T and your W mean the same quantity.</p><p>On the other hand, I&apos;m afraid he&apos;s mistaken in his dimension analysis when<br/>he writes for the dimension analysis of your W:</p><p>W = (m^2 * 1/s^2) * (kg * m)/s^2</p><p>His last  /s^2  does not correspond to anything.</p><p>So you have no problems dimension-wise.</p><p>(Anyway, since your W and his T are identical, there should not be any<br/>dimension problem in the first place.)</p><p>Let me mention though, that esentially it is M (mass per unit lenght) which<br/>is the basic quantity that comes into the equation behind the derivation of<br/>the tension quantity, for, the velocity (V) of the soundwave in the string<br/>is expressed as:</p><p>V =  sqr (Tension / M)</p><p>Thus, it is not only that M embodies the diameter in your relationship<br/>(since the mass per unit lenght and the diameter are linked as I pointed<br/>out), but also the mass per unit lenght occurs to be an initial input to the<br/>setup of the equations in question.</p><p> Pap T.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Cris Forster&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:76153.763@compuserve.com">76153.763@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ozanyarman@superonline.com">ozanyarman@superonline.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 14 May&iuml;&iquest;&half;s 2005 Cumartesi 19:55<br/>Subject: Re: Calculating the tension of a string</p><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Newton&apos;s second law of motion states:</p><p>Force (or Newtons) = Mass (or kilograms) * Acceleration (or<br/>meters/second^2).</p><p>In this context:  Newtons = (kg * m)/s^2</p><p>For strings, mass per unit length, or M/u.l. = Pi * r^2 * rho,<br/>where r is the radius of the string, in meters,<br/>and rho is the mass density of the stringing material,<br/>in kg/m^3.</p><p>For a simplified correct string tension equation that gives</p><p>T = F^2 * L^2 * D^2 * Pi * rho,</p><p>a dimensional analysis (without dimensionless Pi) shows that</p><p>N = 1/s^2 * m^2 * m^2 * kg/m^3.</p><p>A cancellation of dimensions gives the correct unit for Newtons:</p><p>N = (kg * m)/s^2</p><p>However, for your equation below</p><p>W = 4 (.16 m^2 * 193600/s^2) * .008 N</p><p>or (without numerical values)</p><p>W = (m^2 * 1/s^2) * (kg * m)/s^2</p><p>a dimensional analysis gives an incorrect unit for Newtons<br/>or for your tension variable (W):</p><p>W = (kg * m^3)/s^4</p><p>Your string tension equation is not a correct equation,<br/>but an approximate equation based on taking a unit length<br/>of steel wire and weighing it on a scale, or calculating its<br/>mass per unit length from a table of properties for steel, around<br/>7850 kg/m^3.</p><p>All competent builders of stringed instruments - especially of<br/>pianos -<br/>know that mass per unit length varies with string diameter.

He did<br/>not understand this.<br/>&gt; The simple reason is that your M (mass per unit length of the<br/>string), at the RHS of your equation, is equal to D^2 x pi x rho/4,<br/>in his terms (for a cylindrical string).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More specifically, by definition the density rho is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; rho = mass/volume.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; mass = rho x volume.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The volume for a cylinder of height L and base of radius R is the<br/>surface area of the base, i.e. pi x R^2, times its height, i.e. L.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; volume = pi x R^2 x L.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; mass = rho x pi x R^2 x L.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But by definition of the diameter:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D (his diameter) = 2 R,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; R =D /2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus the mass of the string of &quot;mass density&quot; rho, lenght L, and<br/>base radius R is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; mass = rho x pi x [(D^2)/ 4] x L.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This mass, again is the mass of the string of length L.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus the lenght of the string of a &quot;unit lenght&quot;, should be L<br/>times less (since to obtain 1 unit length, we have to reduce L unit<br/>lenghts by L). This makes that the M that you used in your<br/>relationship becomes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; M = {rho x pi x [(D^2)/ 4] x L} / L,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; M = rho x pi x [(D^2)/ 4] .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other terms,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4 M = rho x pi x D^2 .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the two formulae are identical...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now as to what he says about the RHS and the LHS units of your<br/>equation, this is just nonsense...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry but this is the way it is...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pap T.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; M is the mass of the string of a unit lenght.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt;   From: chrysalis2grow<br/>&gt;   To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;   Sent: 13 May&iuml;&iquest;&half;s 2005 Cuma 19:19<br/>&gt;   Subject: [tuning] Calculating the tension of a string<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Ozan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The correct string tension equation is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   T = F^2 * L^2 * D^2 * Pi * rho<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   where T is tension, F is frequency, L is string length, D is<br/>string<br/>&gt;   diameter, and rho is the mass density of the stringing material.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Please note that your equation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   W= 4 (0.16 * 193 600) * 0.008 Newtons<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   is dimensionally incorrect.

If you mean that your<br/>  Ultratonal Piano can change tension by one gram at a time,<br/>  then according to your calculations, it&apos;s changing the note<br/>  by 1/150 mina at a time.
