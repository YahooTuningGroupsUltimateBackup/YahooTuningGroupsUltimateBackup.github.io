Jorgenson talks about tunings with equal beats<br/>&gt;among different instances of the same interval; here we are talking<br/>&gt;about equal beats among *different* intervals within a single chord.<br/>&gt;Apples and oranges.</p><p>I was referring to the way Jorgensen goes through all his temperaments, counting and reporting on the number of &quot;proportionally beating triads&quot;--most of which are typically caused by having a pure 5th.  [And therefore the major 3rd and the minor 3rd in them beat proportionally; so what?]  As if a high count of such in a temperament means it&apos;s somehow better than temperaments with lower counts?</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
