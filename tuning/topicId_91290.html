And Jacques Dudon,<br/>our most generous St. Nicholas who has happily<br/>returned to the Internet and our group after<br/>a tragic natural disaster which struck his community<br/>and region, most fittingly presides at the conclusion<br/>of this contest he has done so much to make possible<br/>and facilitate with congeniality and fairness.</p><p>At the time I became aware of the Ethno2 collection,<br/>taking a special interest in the Soria tunings, I<br/>had no idea what &quot;Ethno2&quot; was.

Since I have not downloaded and heard all the<br/>pieces, and also have certain quirks of hearing that<br/>might bias my listening in ways unrelated to the merits<br/>of these pieces, I consider it wisest to wait for the<br/>judging before sharing some remarks about pieces that<br/>especially impressed me. For the moment, however, I<br/>freely share my enthusiasm, and my special delight<br/>that the Ethno2 collection has sparked or reinforced<br/>interest in Near Eastern modes and styles, and also<br/>some Indigenous modes and styles from my own continent.</p><p>At the same time, Ethno2 and some related tunings of<br/>Jacques Dudon, in combination with Ozan Yarman&apos;s thesis<br/>on the intonational nature and patterns of Turkish maqam<br/>music and the 79-tone qanun, have inspired me to delve<br/>more deeply into the history and practice of this music,<br/>and to devise and play in a new tuning which much<br/>intrigues and excites me.</p><p>It is fitting that to join in the celebration of the<br/>conclusion of this contest, I write a long-promised<br/>review of the Ethno2 collection, which I should do<br/>shortly.</p><p>For now, I would like to focus on one especially<br/>laudible aspect of the collection: a keen and<br/>alert interest in meeting at least halfway the<br/>musician without experience in either ethnomusicology<br/>or microtonality who simply wishes to create beauty<br/>and expand her or his universe of musical colors<br/>and effects.</p><p>The idea of 12-note or sometimes smaller tuning sets<br/>that can aptly map to a single off-the-shelf<br/>keyboard and launch a hitherto uninitiated person<br/>into a new world of sound is one that deserves the<br/>highest form of flattery: emulation.</p><p>Thus I propose an open-ended Tuning List event, not<br/>necessarily a formal &quot;contest&quot; but maybe just an<br/>ongoing theme or dialogue, called &quot;Ethno2 Extras.&quot;<br/>List members would do what I have recently been doing:<br/>seeking out tuning sets (JI or tempered), often of 12<br/>notes or less, which could attract a user of Ethno2<br/>or other digital instruments to make beautiful music<br/>and learn more about the incredible range of world<br/>musical styles, modes, and tunings.</p><p>Of course, such tunings, like the current Ethno2<br/>collection, could also be used with Scala, or with<br/>any amenable instrument, digital or acoustical.</p><p>Also, the tunings could come with optional information<br/>on the musical cultures or styles which prompted them,<br/>on on the larger tuning systems or approaches (e.g. -c)<br/>which help determine or influence their structure.</p><p>Personally I take the view that microtonality is a<br/>continuum, or one parameter of music along with rhythm,<br/>melody, and sometimes also counterpoint or harmony, with<br/>12-EDO merely one point on that continuum, as opposed to<br/>a central point of reference to be uniquely adored or<br/>abhored.</p><p>Advocating for the diversity of world musical traditions<br/>through history is in my opinion the best and most potent<br/>advocacy for &quot;microtonality&quot;: intonational diversity has<br/>been a done deal in a vast range of world musics over the<br/>centuries, and our task is at once to participate in<br/>this diversity and help to get out the word.</p><p>Jacques Dudon and MOTU have helped to do this in a very<br/>special way, along with all who have participated in this<br/>worthy contest.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2010 4:59:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>I like your initiative - considering much conversation over the past<br/>year has been about bringing xenharmonic music to the masses in one<br/>fashion or another I think this fits in well with a shared goal of<br/>many on this tuning list.</p><p>Chris</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus I propose an open-ended Tuning List event, not<br/>&gt; necessarily a formal &quot;contest&quot; but maybe just an<br/>&gt; ongoing theme or dialogue, called &quot;Ethno2 Extras.&quot;<br/>&gt; List members would do what I have recently been doing:<br/>&gt; seeking out tuning sets (JI or tempered), often of 12<br/>&gt; notes or less, which could attract a user of Ethno2<br/>&gt; or other digital instruments to make beautiful music<br/>&gt; and learn more about the incredible range of world<br/>&gt; musical styles, modes, and tunings.</p></div><h3>Domina Catrina Lee &#x3C;ahulijing@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2010 1:37:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>For now, I would like to focus on one especially<br/>laudible aspect of the collection: a keen and<br/>alert interest in meeting at least halfway the<br/>musician without experience in either ethnomusicology<br/>or microtonality who simply wishes to create beauty<br/>and expand her or his universe of musical colors<br/>and effects.</p><p>:Here here.

shortly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For now, I would like to focus on one especially<br/>&gt; laudible aspect of the collection: a keen and<br/>&gt; alert interest in meeting at least halfway the<br/>&gt; musician without experience in either ethnomusicology<br/>&gt; or microtonality who simply wishes to create beauty<br/>&gt; and expand her or his universe of musical colors<br/>&gt; and effects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea of 12-note or sometimes smaller tuning sets<br/>&gt; that can aptly map to a single off-the-shelf<br/>&gt; keyboard and launch a hitherto uninitiated person<br/>&gt; into a new world of sound is one that deserves the<br/>&gt; highest form of flattery: emulation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus I propose an open-ended Tuning List event, not<br/>&gt; necessarily a formal &quot;contest&quot; but maybe just an<br/>&gt; ongoing theme or dialogue, called &quot;Ethno2 Extras.&quot;<br/>&gt; List members would do what I have recently been doing:<br/>&gt;

Also, the tunings could come with optional information<br/>&gt; on the musical cultures or styles which prompted them,<br/>&gt; on on the larger tuning systems or approaches (e.g. -c)<br/>&gt; which help determine or influence their structure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally I take the view that microtonality is a<br/>&gt; continuum, or one parameter of music along with rhythm,<br/>&gt; melody, and sometimes also counterpoint or harmony, with<br/>&gt; 12-EDO merely one point on that continuum, as opposed to<br/>&gt; a central point of reference to be uniquely adored or<br/>&gt; abhored.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Advocating for the diversity of world musical traditions<br/>&gt; through history is in my opinion the best and most potent<br/>&gt; advocacy for &quot;microtonality&quot;: intonational diversity has<br/>&gt; been a done deal in a vast range of world musics over the<br/>&gt; centuries, and our task is at once to participate in<br/>&gt; this diversity and help to get out the word.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacques Dudon and MOTU have helped to do this in a very<br/>&gt; special way, along with all who have participated in this<br/>&gt; worthy contest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

Now, many tunings such as the ones I develop sometimes can perfectly work as temperaments, and have in addition differential coherence and/or equal-beating qualities.<br/>Some others of my sequential tunings have those same acoustic qualities but would be more difficult to use as classical temperaments, because they won&apos;t give simple access to all the first harmonics and they would rather make use of more specific inharmonic timbres. But you can make music with both and I think they complement each other.</p><p>&gt; What are some alternative 12-note sets for Rast, or<br/>&gt; Shur, or Afshari, or (not the least!) our beloved Buzurg?</p><p>Ethno2 proposed models of those, but they need more notes variations to meet the needs of more Maqamat, Datsgah and Avaz, and you are definitively the person who can propose such sets.</p><p>&gt; The differentially coherent JI (-c) is a unifying theme which at<br/>&gt; once reflects a fine-tuned (literally and figuratively) musical<br/>&gt; sensitivity and inspires others to strive for similar discernment,<br/>&gt; whether following this approach or some other.</p><p>One specific aspect of traditional music is that, most of the time, it uses a small number of tones.<br/>This means that the reduction of the number of tones, with a ordinary 12 tones per octave-keyboard for example, is not always a need. This does not mean at all that temperaments are not useful in traditional music : how to tune a heptatonic Kora with only 7 notes in classical JI is a vast problem. But on a keyboard we can also embellish a tuning with additional JI intervals, or complementary -c intervals, that&apos;s what I did in many of my tunings through the use of double notes.<br/>I suspect double notes may make some analysis functions of Scala more difficult. But these are part of the tuning,<br/>I personnally like them, it&apos;s a facility offered by the keyboard that adds a variety of vocal-like expressions we find in many traditional music and I noticed these were used by some Ethno2 participants. In addition all those small commas here of course are equal or proportional-beating.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>On Mon, 26 Jul 2010, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Posted by: &quot;Jacques Dudon&quot; fotosonix@...<br/>&gt; &gt; Sun Jul 25, 2010 6:34 am (PDT)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dear Margo,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your very kind comments, your enthusiastic words and this<br/>&gt; &gt; creative proposition !<br/>&gt; &gt; I agree with all what you say here and I simply say : let&apos;s do it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Jacques,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your enthusiasm, especially at the conclusion of what &gt; has<br/>&gt; been an arduous process of coordinating and now judging a wonderful<br/>&gt; contest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Ethno2 extras&quot; is fine but it refers to a specific software, which<br/>&gt; &gt; should improve someday in a Ethno3 version.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very good point!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The moment has not come but I am certain that all the 12<br/>&gt; &gt; participants of that adventure will have useful suggestions to<br/>&gt; &gt; address, starting from missing or problematic instruments, and not<br/>&gt; &gt; to mention the mapping implementations where Manuel Op de Coul I<br/>&gt; &gt; am sure could bring his expertise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me join you in saying that Manuel Op de Coul has made<br/>&gt; incredible contributions over the years with his knowledge, his<br/>&gt; patient advocacy for alternative tuning systems, and, of course,<br/>&gt; with Scala!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So anyway I would propose to call such project simply &quot;Ethno &gt; Extras&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; I know very well my Ethno2 collection is uncomplete, and I would be<br/>&gt; &gt; glad to offer my participation if I can, to keep record of these<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Ethno extras&quot; for example, since I have already a database for &gt; that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I would say is that your Ethno2 collection is indeed, as I &gt; delight<br/>&gt; to call it and shall soon use as the title of a review, a world &gt; tour de<br/>&gt; force. The differentially coherent JI (-c) is a unifying theme &gt; which at<br/>&gt; once reflects a fine-tuned (literally and figuratively) musical<br/>&gt; sensitivity and inspires others to strive for similar discernment,<br/>&gt; whether following this approach or some other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; is the heading I shall use in threads posting or<br/>&gt; discussing these supplementary tunings, many of which will focus<br/>&gt; on maqam/dastgah music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the meantime and among others, I would be personnally very<br/>&gt; &gt; interested to have access just to a &quot;Margo Schulter Ethno<br/>&gt; &gt; collection&quot;. Knowing the background these tunings could be provided<br/>&gt; &gt; with, if you write someday a documentation, that would be a<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal treasure !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed, the &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; project is in large part a homage to the<br/>&gt; Ethno2 collection, with the quest for musical excellence in &gt; _accessible_<br/>&gt; form certainly a theme of your collection and the recent contest. One<br/>&gt; of my goals will be, for example, to document some of the notable &gt; modes<br/>&gt; and tetrachords, etc., in a given tuning set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And with these tunings and their documentation, as with Ethno2 and<br/>&gt; future versions as refined in part through the contest, feedback<br/>&gt; from you and others will be invaluable in making the documentation<br/>&gt; as readable and informative as possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I must tell you is how exciting this process has been, with<br/>&gt; the Ethno2 collection and our discussions here pointing in so<br/>&gt; many directions. Is there some interesting variation on an Ethno2<br/>&gt; that might be interesting to explore? Can certain temperaments<br/>&gt; sometimes evoke some of the qualities of spectral coherence, if<br/>&gt; not of -c? What are some alternative 12-note sets for Rast, or<br/>&gt; Shur, or Afshari, or (not the least!) our beloved Buzurg?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The contest is a good reminder that tunings are meant to be<br/>&gt; _used_, and &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; has a high standard for which to strive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2010 3:13:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,<br/>This is Margo&apos;s idea, so I leave it to her to answer to these questions. From my point of view, but she seems to say the same, I do not think it should be limited to one school of tuning or another. The Ethno2 tunings show that there is no contradiction anyway between temperaments and JI (at least in my conception of JI !). They also don&apos;t only use recurrent sequences, but lots of traditional material improved in the form of differential coherence modeling.<br/>Connection with &quot;ethnic music&quot;, if this project is named *Ethno* Extras, I would guess yes, resonances with musical traditions of all times but why not also neo-traditional propositions if it makes sense in relation to former tuning traditions. Isn&apos;t it what Ozan does, for example ?<br/>But in Ethno2 I have also added quite a few fractal and other adventurous tunings, intuitively dropped at some ends of specific geographic areas - such as Liane for example, with which I pretended to do an &quot;Aztec-Jazz&quot; demo...<br/>So you see I won&apos;t be the one to throw the first stone if others want to add more imaginary or neo-traditions.<br/>Next question is : Are the actual 11 geographic folders sufficient, or do we want to extend as well to ethnies from other planets ??? :)<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>Gene wrote :<br/>&gt; &gt; (Jacques) : I know very well my Ethno2 collection is uncomplete,<br/>&gt; &gt; and I would be glad to offer my participation if I can, to keep &gt; record of these<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Ethno extras&quot; for example, since I have already a database for &gt; that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you speaking of extending the catalog of scales?
