Luc also likes Indian music, esp&apos;ly tambura music/solos.<br/>I guess drones are not that too different than purring sounds. Also<br/>microtonal music maybe new to Luc, cats tending to be naturally curious, adventuresome<br/>creatures. Luc&apos;s primary human is a rock musician, so probably Luc likes the<br/>&quot;change of sonic scenery&quot; and the wide variety of musics I listen to.<br/>    Intriguin&apos; experiment: play some Indian music and other kinds of music<br/>(i.e. Arabic, Maori, Australian Aborigine, etc.) for your dog and see how he<br/>reacts... report the informal scientific results.
