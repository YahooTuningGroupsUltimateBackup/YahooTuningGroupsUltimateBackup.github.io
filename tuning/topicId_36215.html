(Measure *between* the wobbles, of course.) That might be<br/>&gt; helpful in<br/>&gt;&gt; making the decision whether or not to go any further with high-third<br/>&gt;&gt; jerries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Wendell:<br/>&gt; I assume &quot;amusing&quot; is a reference to my use of that word in an<br/>&gt; earlier post. &quot;Amusing&quot;, if you go back and read my post and refrain<br/>&gt; from divorcing the word from context, describes my enjoyment of<br/>&gt; the &quot;almost irrestible attraction&quot; that a clean, just 4:5 third has<br/>&gt; for the ear. It refers to that and nothing more. You also did this<br/>&gt; with &quot;naive&quot; when I used it to refer to experimental subjects in a<br/>&gt; well-known study of pitch/frequency correlation.</p><p>Bob, your overall *glee* in finding fault with the demos was unmistakable.</p><p>As you may remember, I complimented you when you *withdrew* the &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot;<br/>reference. Evidently, you now have some regret in that regard. Is that<br/>because Paul later defended that choice of words.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I ask that you please read with context in mind and refrain from<br/>&gt; automatically applying to yourself adjectives you find disagreeable,<br/>&gt; without any  thought to their actual targets, just because I<br/>&gt; challenge your position.</p><p>You are welcome to challenge my &quot;position&quot; any time. That&apos;s how I learn.<br/>Evidently, you feel I should not challenge yours. I assumed that challenging<br/>is important to progress in the process of intellectual exchange. Am I<br/>wrong?</p><p>&gt;I also beg you to refrain from subtle and<br/>&gt; prejudicial polemics in our threads such as the reference to my use<br/>&gt; of &quot;amusing&quot;. If you felt insulted by my honest depiction of my<br/>&gt; perceptions, then I feel that discourages the clear, honest statement<br/>&gt; of opinions, something you have said you value.</p><p>Bob, I read your comment in the &quot;context&quot; of your continually bitter<br/>responses to my questioning your statements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If your ideas have real merit, then it is unnecessary to resort to<br/>&gt; any tactics aimed at discrediting challenges to them.</p><p>True. However, it is often necessary to offer clarifications when<br/>&quot;challenges&quot; appear to be off the mark. Why do you take my attempts at<br/>clarification to be &quot;tactics&quot;?</p><p>&gt; Instead I<br/>&gt; suggest using clear reasoning.</p><p>I try. But then I happen to be imperfect. Perhaps you could help me, since<br/>your reasoning is apparently beyond questioning.</p><p>&gt; I have responded to your position by<br/>&gt; stating my understanding of it for you succinctly in easy-to-<br/>&gt; understand steps, and as requested, you confirmed with no<br/>&gt; reservations whatsoever that my understanding was indeed accurate.</p><p>That is correct. And you have done an accurate job of restating most of my<br/>concerns here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far you have failed to respond in kind. I have only received<br/>&gt; responses characterized by defensive distortions of my positions. No<br/>&gt; description of yours relating to my position has come close to<br/>&gt; anything I could confirm as accurate.</p><p>That may simply be because I don&apos;t understand your &quot;position.&quot; I didn&apos;t know<br/>you had one. Perhaps you could state it.</p><p>You have offered your opinions and reported your perceptions regarding the<br/>jerries. Is that what you mean by &quot;position&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul understands my position so well he was actually able to very<br/>&gt; effectively answer as if he were I in responding to one of your posts<br/>&gt; step by step. He did an accurate, absolutely stellar job. I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have done it better myself. You, on the other hand, even with<br/>&gt; plentiful corrective input from both Paul and me, have consistently<br/>&gt; distorted my position, with all kinds of projections concerning my<br/>&gt; motives and supposed desire to coerce you and others into my way of<br/>&gt; thinking. So far, the more we try to correct you understading of my<br/>&gt; position, the more entangled it gets...endlessly.</p><p>By the phrase &quot;corrective input&quot; do you mean &quot;clarification of your point of<br/>view&quot;? Or, do you mean &quot;ideas that Jerry should swallow uncritically simply<br/>because you and/or Paul stated them&quot;? Your answer here should be<br/>enlightening.</p><p>Bob, we have hashed through this bickering off-list for a few days now. You<br/>asked me to &quot;refrain from any further intimations or direct<br/>statements of my [your] having waffled or changed positions on what I [you]<br/>originally heard.&quot; I agreed to do that. Now you drag this wrangling to the<br/>list. What does that accomplish? This is not a contest to see who &quot;wins.&quot;<br/>It&apos;s an exchange of ideas that might help to shed light on the &quot;high third,&quot;<br/>an observation I have made for many decades. That&apos;s it. No ego. No<br/>predetermined &quot;position.&quot; Just honest inquiry with the help of folks who<br/>know something about pitch relations and perceptual anomalies.</p><p>If my *questions* regarding your reported perceptions appeared to be<br/>personal challenges, I apologize. When I suggested you were waffling, it was<br/>because it appeared to me that you *were*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have clearly stated your position, which in spite of my clarity<br/>&gt; concerning what it is, frankly makes no sense to me.</p><p>Interesting that you can state my thinking in your own terms yet can&apos;t<br/>understand it. Sorry it&apos;s still a mystery to you. In some ways, it&apos;s still a<br/>mystery to me as well, if that makes you feel any better. By the way, I have<br/>no &quot;position.&quot; What we learn here we learn. That&apos;s it.</p><p>Also, even my report of hearing singers commonly use the high third is<br/>subject to &quot;correction.&quot; Who knows? The *whole thing* may be an illusion.<br/>That&apos;s what I&apos;m here to try to find out. In that regard, the frequency<br/>analysis of the &quot;baby choir&quot; demo seems to show that the sung pitches are in<br/>fact real frequencies. I guess we can&apos;t just blow that away as &quot;illusion.&quot;</p><p>&gt; I ask you to<br/>&gt; make a similarly honest and forthright attempt to understand my<br/>&gt; postion; not to agreee with it, but to simply demonstrate to me that<br/>&gt; you understand it clearly. If you attempt this till you get it right,<br/>&gt; I will confirm its accuracy for you.</p><p>As you said of my &quot;position,&quot; it makes no sense to me. I cannot say that<br/>about yours because I don&apos;t know that you have stated a position. You have<br/>reported perceptions, quoted studies and evidently drawn your own<br/>conclusions about them. I have spent hours with you reflecting my<br/>impressions and asking for clarifications. What more can I do?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only after you&apos;ve done this can we have a reliable platform from<br/>&gt; which to conduct further communications. I ask that any such further<br/>&gt; communications be free of accusations of alledged ulterior motives<br/>&gt; and that you accept my statements concerning my perceptions at face<br/>&gt; value wihtout questioning my integrity in describing them. You don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to agree with them, but only accept them as my honestly<br/>&gt; described perceptions.</p><p>As I said off-list, your honesty was never in question. That&apos;s *your*<br/>impression, not mine. The only things I questioned had to do with what I<br/>suspected might not actually relate to the facts. I think I have an<br/>obligation to voice those questions order to discover whether my suspicions<br/>(not your honesty) are accurate or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also ask that if you&apos;re not capable of responding without logical<br/>&gt; flaws in your conclusions and responses regarding either your<br/>&gt; perceptions or our communications with each other, that you at least<br/>&gt; remain open to corrections to those flaws when we point them out,<br/>&gt; rather than simply resorting to disparaging polemics and doubts<br/>&gt; concerning the integrity of our motives.</p><p>Noting that you appear to have changed your report after talking with Paul<br/>is not a &quot;disparaging polemic.&quot; It simply notes that you in fact *did*. You<br/>confirmed this to Joe. When I attempted to discuss it you took it as<br/>offensive. If my &quot;style&quot; appeared antagonistic, I apologize. I&apos;m not the<br/>first one on this list to come off that way, not will I be the last. (Which<br/>doesn&apos;t make it right, however.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please respond step by step with clear, well-reasoned statements and<br/>&gt; questions. This will provide a simple format that allows quick, well-<br/>&gt; placed responses that correct any misperceptions and logical flaws<br/>&gt; without getting buried in unproductive rhetoric.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I have the time to go over every post we have made and try to<br/>sort out the communication problem. In any case, my extensive efforts<br/>off-list seems to have made no dent. Why would further attempts be any more<br/>successful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are the only conditions under which I agree to spend my<br/>&gt; precious time in further discussion in this particular thread. Thank<br/>&gt; you in advance for your cooperation, Jerry.</p><p>Sorry not to accommodate you on this, Bob. I&apos;ve done what I can to clarify<br/>my thoughts. I&apos;m afraid it&apos;ll just have to rest there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob</p><p>Likewise,</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>katsuda &#x3C;KATSUDA@NET.EMAIL.NE.JP&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2002 4:54:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, this is Tetsuji from Japan.<br/>I am not new in this mailing list, but<br/>I think this is the first time to post message.</p><p>I want to announce that I developed two programs.<br/>(1) Tuning &amp; Scale Changer for MIDI<br/><a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~HB9T-KTD/music/mus1oe.html">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~HB9T-KTD/music/mus1oe.html</a><br/>(2) Mandelbrot Music Composer<br/><a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~HB9T-KTD/music/mus1te.html">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~HB9T-KTD/music/mus1te.html</a></p><p>(1) is share, but can be used as trial.<br/>(2) is free.<br/>I used the outline of image to compose<br/>music form Mandelbrot set.<br/>I am not sure that somebody use the same method.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Tetsuji</p></div>
