And now why is that so funny?</p><p>Well, it contradicts practically *every* other statement in the book,<br/>where he states that no consensus is being established, and there is<br/>no real reason to expect that such is *going* to happen.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to type them all up... alright, I&apos;ll type *one* up,<br/>from page 3, &quot;Prelude&quot;:</p><p>&quot;Agreement on a standardized system of microtonal notation thus<br/>becomes an imperative for all composers working with fractional<br/>pitches.  yet the prognosis for such a notational utopia is not<br/>encouraging;  as music editor, composer, and musicologist Rudolf<br/>Rasch lamented in a letter to this researcher: &quot;Experience up to now<br/>has taught me that most composers prefer to stick to their own<br/>systems of notation and are not willing to adopt anything proposed by<br/>somebody else.&apos;  The present study surely verifies Rasch&apos;s<br/>conclusion.&quot;</p><p>So, basically, what was Read on when he wrote Chapter IV??  Ecstasy??<br/>or something stronger...?</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
