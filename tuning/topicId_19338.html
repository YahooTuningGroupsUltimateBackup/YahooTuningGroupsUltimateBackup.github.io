Let me explain.  All<br/>said and done, the FAQ cannot become simpler beyond a certain<br/>limit.  A certain minimum knowledge will be, obvioulsy, assumed on<br/>the part of the reader as he tries to follow answers to the questions.</p><p>What is that minimum?  Do I have that minimum level?  If I don&apos;t?  Do<br/>I get thrown out of the system?  How many FAQ&apos;s can I ask on those<br/>FAQ?</p><p>Therefore, I request all the contributing scholars to specify<br/>(i)  the present required level;<br/>(ii) the sources of material that I can access, to prepare myself, to<br/>begin at the very beginning, before I venture to &quot;go where no<br/>neophyte member has gone before&quot;.  All the internet-based sources --<br/>if there are any -- will be very welcome, though I doubt whether<br/>any &quot;tailor-made&quot; material is availble.</p><p>Thanking you in anticipation,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
