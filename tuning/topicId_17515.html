Secular composers had<br/>to have some idea of what was acceptable, not only to the church, but also<br/>their audiences.<br/>    I believe that the harmonic values of meantone could have infused<br/>Beethoven&apos;s early thinking, and the developing well temperaments allowed him<br/>to be daring in his treatment of these values while drawing more<br/>sophisticated contrasts within the more complex well tempered system.<br/>    Also, in the question of dissonance, it is not that great a leap from the<br/>1/6 comma meantones to the Kirnberger&apos;s  and Werckmeister&apos;s tunings,<br/>especially on the lower tension instruments of his day.  Because a 1/6 comma<br/>tuning will provide for 8 keys with 6.4 cent wide tonic thirds and the<br/>highest four keys ( B, F#, C# and G#) with tonic thirds of 28 cents, the line<br/>of demarcation is not so clearly drawn. A Werckmeister has three thirds out<br/>there at 21 cents.  A larger difference would be the comparitive lack of<br/>differing key character in the 1/6comma, since it only offered two levels of<br/>tonality as opposed to the Werckmeisters four or the Kirnberger&apos;s eight<br/>steps.<br/>     The audiences of 1795 may have really enjoyed the piquancy of dissonance<br/>that one of these meantone tunings would have provided, but today, on our<br/>modern pianos,  Beethoven&apos;s music seems harsh and disruptive with it.  Also,<br/>I think he was completely aware of the palette that the well temperaments<br/>offered , and used it with an unequalled sense of finesse.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div><h3><a id=17530 href="#17530">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;joseph@composersconcordance.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2001 7:20:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, a440a@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17515">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17515</a></p><p>&gt;      I am not claiming that total consonance was the meantone<br/>composers objective, but rather, it was their current state of<br/>accepted intonation.

And here I thought we sometimes had it tough on ye<br/>old Tuning List!</p><p>&gt;     I believe that the harmonic values of meantone could have<br/>infused Beethoven&apos;s early thinking, and the developing well<br/>temperaments allowed him to be daring in his treatment of these<br/>values while drawing more sophisticated contrasts within the more<br/>complex well tempered system.</p><p>This makes sense... and it would be clear that he would be aware of<br/>the tuning system he was working with at any given period of time,<br/>correct?  In other words, he was not writing in a tuning system as<br/>some kind of &quot;compromise&quot;  (say toward JI sonorities, or whatever)<br/>but was just writing with the system he had at his &quot;fingertips&quot; so to<br/>speak...</p><p>&gt;     Also, in the question of dissonance, it is not that great a<br/>leap from the 1/6 comma meantones to the Kirnberger&apos;s  and<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s tunings, especially on the lower tension instruments<br/>of<br/>his day.

A Werckmeister has three thirds out there at 21 cents.</p><p>I&apos;m assuming, then, that what you&apos;re saying is that at that point in<br/>time they were actually using 1/6 comma meantone, rather than 1/4<br/>comma... That&apos;s pretty crucial to the further development of &quot;well<br/>temperaments,&quot; therefore, yes??</p><p>&gt;A larger difference would be the comparitive<br/>lack of differing key character in the 1/6comma, since it only<br/>offered two levels of tonality as opposed to the Werckmeisters four<br/>or<br/>the Kirnberger&apos;s eight steps.</p><p>Ummm, actually Johnny Reinhard showed this to me.  He has played<br/>pieces for me in Werckmeister, and even the MOTIVES are strongly<br/>predicated on the particulars of any given key.  One would never know<br/>this until hearing the pieces in the &quot;real&quot; tunings...</p><p>&gt;The audiences of 1795 may have really enjoyed the piquancy of<br/>dissonance that one of these meantone tunings would have provided,<br/>but today, on our modern pianos,  Beethoven&apos;s music seems harsh and<br/>disruptive with it.  Also,  I think he was completely aware of the<br/>palette that the well temperaments offered , and used it with an<br/>unequalled sense of finesse.</p><p>So what do you do regarding the use of PIANOS in your historical<br/>recordings?  I guess you mentioned that your recent release was on a<br/>MODERN grand.  Would this be the best way to listen to Beethoven, or<br/>would it even be MORE interesting to find a piano from that era?..</p><p>Of course, maybe they don&apos;t work so great any more.... :)</p><p>I look forward to your CD, which I purchased...</p><p>_______ _____ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
