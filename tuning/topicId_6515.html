<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>revised and expanded Haba stuff on my site</h1><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1999 9:18:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fellow tuners,</p><p>I&apos;ve added some nifty color-coding to my &apos;Haba - List of Works&apos;<br/>website, indicating quarter-tone pieces in red, 1/6-tone in green,<br/>and 1/5-tone in blue.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/haba-worklist.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/haba-worklist.htm</a></p><p>One of the sources I used mentioned how Haba continued to compose<br/>microtonal music all his life, but how the percentage of his work<br/>that was microtonal dropped off dramatically after the communist<br/>takeover of Czechoslovakia.  This is vividly portrayed on my list<br/>now.  It&apos;s also made obvious that during the 1920s and 1930s the<br/>vast majority of his work was in 24-tET.</p><p>I&apos;ve also turned my posting of a couple of weeks ago, translating<br/>Haba&apos;s article on Schoenberg, into a webpage.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/schoenbergbook.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haba/schoenbergbook.htm</a></p><p>If anyone out there has good knowledge of German and can improve<br/>my translation, I would appreciate the feedback.  The original<br/>German text is reproduced exactly as it was printed.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
