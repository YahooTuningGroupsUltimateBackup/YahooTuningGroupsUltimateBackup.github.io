I could have been gravely<br/>mistaken. I guess I was going by the high-school delineations of<br/>Renaissance=modal=1500-1600, and Baroque=tonal=1600-1750. Can you straighten<br/>me out?</p><p>&gt;At the same time, the shift in vertical aesthetics toward a<br/>&gt;fundamental contrast between concordant and boldly dissonant<br/>&gt;sonorities defining a key might make the graduated acoustical<br/>&gt;&quot;dissonance&quot; of the thirds and sixths in a 12-note well-temperament<br/>&gt;a less obtrusive compromise.</p><p>Couldn&apos;t one argue, though, that the importance of the constrast between<br/>consonance and dissonance in the later style would make it more important to<br/>tune the consonances as consonantly as possible, so as to highlight the<br/>constrast?</p><p>&gt;Thus an unequal well-temperament of the kind introduced by<br/>&gt;Werckmeister and very likely applied to Bach&apos;s WTC in 1722 not only<br/>&gt;made free transpositions available as a prime element of variety in<br/>&gt;the new key system, but augmented that variety by lending contrasting<br/>&gt;acoustical &quot;colors&quot; to these transpositions of what appeared on paper<br/>&gt;to be identical intervals, scale patterns, and key progressions.</p><p>Such a variety is easily acheived in a 19- or 31-tone well-temperament and<br/>thus does not constitute an argument for 12-tone tuning.</p><p>&gt;The Manneristic approach offers the radical alternative of a system of<br/>&gt;12 modes and 31 steps, combining modal flexibility, full circulation<br/>&gt;if desired, and chromatic and enharmonic nuances making the meantone<br/>&gt;diesis a high artistic resource as well as a mathematical necessity.</p><p>&gt;To conclude, both the meantone keyboard tunings of the Manneristic Era<br/>&gt;(including those for 19-note and 31-note instruments), and the 12-note<br/>&gt;well-temperaments of Bach&apos;s era, may reflect as well as reinforce the<br/>&gt;stylistic preferences of these eras. Each system has its own unique<br/>&gt;possibilities.</p><p>Given my last point, I believe we need to find an alternative explanation<br/>for the &quot;retreat&quot; to 12 tones. My guess: practical convenience (for the<br/>instrument maker and player).</p></div>
