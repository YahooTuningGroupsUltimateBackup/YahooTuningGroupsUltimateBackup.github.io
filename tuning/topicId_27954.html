However, I think that&apos;s very well<br/>&gt; possible on the<br/>&gt;&gt; dinarra, since the strings are very close to the fretboard.<br/>&gt; By &apos;bend&apos; I mean<br/>&gt;&gt; moving a string sideways, in the same direction as the fret, so you<br/>&gt; change<br/>&gt;&gt; the pitch. (This is what David Beardsley indicated.) I tried<br/>&gt; to &apos;bend&apos; but<br/>&gt;&gt; needed too much force, because of the 0.011 inch E-string. Strings<br/>&gt; had<br/>&gt;&gt; really extremely heavy tension.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -- Wim<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that strange because I have little trouble bending a 0.011<br/>&gt; inch high E string by a whole tone. Then again, I&apos;m used to bending<br/>&gt; all the time, even on 0.013s; Wim, as a classical player, may not<br/>&gt; exercise the bending muscles much (Wim?)</p><p>You&apos;re right, Paul: classical players hardly ever bend the strings. However,<br/>while I studied the Indian sitar in Amsterdam, long time ago, I learned a<br/>very efficient technic, allowing bends up to a fourth. I decided to stop my<br/>sitar studies then, but still continued to use this technic, especially in<br/>contemporary guitarmusic. (To do even a real quartertone-bend on a classical<br/>guitar you have to pull up the string much more than on an electric guitar.)</p><p>When I said that bends weren&apos;t possible on the heavy gauge string Dinnara, I<br/>really mend to say that they were useless, since the expressive bend-pitch<br/>could be perfectly achieved by a mere change in the finger-position, moving<br/>some frets upward or downwards. I concluded that with heavy strings the<br/>system was self-supplying, not needing any &apos;intruders&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that anything thinner than a 0.010 inch set gives poor tone,<br/>&gt; even on my nice electric guitars.</p><p>Agreed.

I wasn&apos;t able to bend strings<br/>too well without them.  After having played so many fretted temperaments on<br/>a guitar, I&apos;ve noticed several times that after about 40 notes an octave,<br/>not only what Wim said, that expression can be achieved, but also that I<br/>completely lose the *urge* to bend completely.  In the 20s and 30s even, I<br/>still occasionally bend notes out a little to see if I&apos;m playing in the<br/>right temperament, I mean, if I&apos;m trying to hit a note that&apos;s just not<br/>there.  In the 40s and up, I *always* feel an instinct to slide, never to<br/>bend.</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned before my experience that differently tempered fretboards can<br/>sound so different on the same guitar.  The point?  Well... thanks to this<br/>post, I just realized that I&apos;ve never once thought of using thicker strings,<br/>just out of force of habit.  I can now imagine, that all of the curious<br/>microacoustic echoing around fret cavities that makes such distinct timbres,<br/>would most probably be made richer by putting on thicker strings.  The<br/>thought just never occurred, &quot;hey now that I don&apos;t have to bend strings<br/>anymore, maybe thicker strings would add to the sound.&quot;</p><p>Thanks for posting (?!)  Strange part of a strange thread to all of a sudden<br/>have sparked a thought so profound to my current set up.</p><p>Most serendipitous.</p><p>Marc</p></div>
