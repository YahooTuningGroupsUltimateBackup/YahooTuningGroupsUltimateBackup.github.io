Frankly, those kind of people won&apos;t ever be part of my ensembles! But - in a certain sense - the burden is a little on you, the composer, to illuminate the performer as to the positive aspects of the music they just might have a chance to play. I doubt simply looking at a score will sway many people, but maybe a good recording, that at least hints at the drama, musical complexity, or evocative experience to be had will do what dollars and arm twisting can&apos;t.</p><p>Long-winded. It always seems to end up that way with me. But I&apos;m really hoping that you just take your time and find the Right Person to do the piece. They must be out there.</p><p>You&apos;ll find them.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 3:00:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; And here&apos;s yet *another* anonymous 72-tET performer response:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Possibly.

You definitely are throwing off the vibe of packing it<br/>in, and just presenting such works as electronic.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Oh, that was just momentary depression!  I&apos;m a &quot;die hard&quot;<br/>microtonal enthusiast; I&apos;m just trying to find out the most practical<br/>way of going about this.</p><p>I guess the most *extreme* solution I would tackle, if pushed, would<br/>be to do what composer Jonathan Harvey does sometimes, and that is<br/>put the microtonal stuff in the electronic part, and keep the<br/>performer mostly in 12-tET.  With 72-tET, of course, that works like<br/>a charm...</p><p>HOWEVER, I really believe it is in the interest of the *performers*<br/>to try these new things and, I agree, I have to sell it a bit more.<br/>However, the attitude of this particular person just cited was *so*<br/>bad, I don&apos;t even want to try the salesmanship angle.  Two words<br/>apply to this person:  F*ck you!</p><p>&gt; How about a middle path?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What would happen if, as you pursue non-12 music, you devote a<br/>little more time (and, probably - and unfortunately - a little more<br/>cash for gear) on recordings of the pieces that you *still* would<br/>like to be for live performance.

A premiere is a bit more problematic,<br/>but I&apos;m still optimistic...</p><p>In any case, I&apos;m just reporting various hurdles we have to deal with<br/>as we try to integrate microtonality into the *larger* community...<br/>It&apos;s all on a &quot;person by person&quot; basis, of course, and it takes the<br/>right person and the right attitude!</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 7:11:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39485">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39485</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And here&apos;s yet *another* anonymous 72-tET performer response:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Possibly.

Well, my point, basically is<br/>that this is a *frequent* response of the &quot;pros!&quot;  I&apos;m beginning to<br/>think I had better luck with my violist last year than I thought.<br/>Although she played my micro piece *miserably* at least she *tried*<br/>it!</p><p>Little do many of these performers know that in addition to the<br/>*psychic* gains, there are *practical* gains to playing microtonality<br/>as well.  The most obvious one, of course, would be a greater<br/>sensitivity to pitch and intonation even for *traditional* 12-equal<br/>pieces!  I know my *own* hearing has improved in this process.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;ll get some *positive* responses, too.  I&apos;ll try to post some<br/>of these anonymously:  the good, the bad and the *ugly...*  :)</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
