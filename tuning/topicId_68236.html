I&apos;m interested in your last &gt; paragraph, as you&apos;ve had more experience than I with such tunings.  &gt; You say that a symmetrical 9-note scale can be made by skipping every &gt; other step - that&apos;s easy enough to see; that it has useful harmonic &gt; resources, by which I take it you mean it nicely approximates a few &gt; interesting ratios; and that it has useful melodic properties.  &gt; Doesn&apos;t the lack of a leading tone make this a rather restless scale &gt; melodically?  And further, are there any really solid-sounding &gt; harmonic progressions that are natural to a symmetric scale?  On this &gt; score, I mean without fudging it by using a few triads and then a &gt; tetrad-with-seventh.  &gt; &gt; What I&apos;m getting at, is just how useful you think the properties of &gt; this scale are for composition: is it worth the trouble of tuning up &gt; to experiment in, or would other scales in 19-EDO offer a richer &gt; palette?</p><p>I don&apos;t think the 9-note scale by itself is anywhere near as useful as the diatonic scale, but it&apos;s one of the more notable features of 19-ET, and like the whole-tone scale in 12-ET, it could be used for extra flavor. I don&apos;t know whether you&apos;d consider the scale as restless -- it depends on which note you use as the tonic. I think wide leading tones (126.3 cents in this case) can give a scale a more &quot;relaxed&quot; character, without the strong sense of resolving a dissonance that you get with scales that have narrower leading tones. One of the melodic features I find interesting is the ability to split the major third into three equal steps. Unfortunately it doesn&apos;t have many triads for a scale of its size (2 major + 2 minor + 2 augmented), and the available progressions are limited (e.g., Bb minor - A minor - F major - Gb major - Bb minor).</p><p>As Gene mentioned, hanson temperament has a scale with a chain of minor thirds, which I&apos;ve found to be quite useful in the 11-note version. Although I haven&apos;t specifically tried it in 19-ET, the fact that 19-ET has such good minor thirds makes that a good option to try out. There are probably many other scales in 19-ET that could be of some use; here is a list of strictly proper 7-note scales (giving the number of 19-ET steps between each note of the scale)</p><p>1 3 3 3 3 3 3<br/>1 4 2 3 3 2 4<br/>2 2 3 3 3 3 3<br/>2 3 2 3 3 2 4<br/>2 3 2 3 3 3 3<br/>2 3 2 4 2 3 3<br/>2 3 3 2 3 3 3 (diatonic)</p><p>Each of these can have different modes, depending on which note you start with (compare the major 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 and minor 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 scales, which are both rotations of the diatonic scale structure). Then there are many 7-note scales that are proper but not strictly proper, as well as scales with different numbers of notes.</p></div><h3><a id=68275 href="#68275">ðŸ”—</a>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2006 4:52:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yahya_melb&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What I&apos;m getting at, is just how useful you think the properties<br/>of this scale are for composition: is it worth the trouble of tuning<br/>up to experiment in, or would other scales in 19-EDO offer a richer<br/>palette?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aside from meantone/flattone, with an 11d19 fifth as generator,<br/>logical things to try are magic/muggles, with a 6d19 major third as<br/>generator, and keemun/hanson, with a 5d19 (nearly pure) minor third<br/>as generator.<br/>&gt; Meantone of course has nice MOS scales of size 7 and 12.

I don&apos;t know whether you&apos;d consider the scale as<br/>restless -- it depends on which note you use as the tonic. I think<br/>wide leading tones (126.3 cents in this case) can give a scale a<br/>more &quot;relaxed&quot; character, without the strong sense of resolving a<br/>dissonance that you get with scales that have narrower leading tones.<br/>One of the melodic features I find interesting is the ability to<br/>split the major third into three equal steps. Unfortunately it<br/>doesn&apos;t have many triads for a scale of its size (2 major + 2 minor +<br/>2 augmented), and the available progressions are limited (e.g., Bb<br/>minor - A minor - F major - Gb major - Bb minor).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Gene mentioned, hanson temperament has a scale with a chain of<br/>minor thirds, which I&apos;ve found to be quite useful in the 11-note<br/>version.<br/>&gt; Although I haven&apos;t specifically tried it in 19-ET, the fact that 19-<br/>ET has such good minor thirds makes that a good option to try out.<br/>There are probably many other scales in 19-ET that could be of some<br/>use; here is a list of strictly proper 7-note scales (giving the<br/>number of 19-ET steps between each note of the scale)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1 3 3 3 3 3 3<br/>&gt; 1 4 2 3 3 2 4<br/>&gt; 2 2 3 3 3 3 3<br/>&gt; 2 3 2 3 3 2 4<br/>&gt; 2 3 2 3 3 3 3<br/>&gt; 2 3 2 4 2 3 3<br/>&gt; 2 3 3 2 3 3 3 (diatonic)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each of these can have different modes, depending on which note you<br/>start with (compare the major 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 and minor 3 2 3 3 2 3 3<br/>scales, which are both rotations of the diatonic scale structure).<br/>Then there are many 7-note scales that are proper but not strictly<br/>proper, as well as scales with different numbers of notes.</p><p>Thank you for these ideas, Herman.</p><p>Two of the &quot;strictly proper&quot; scales you listed have three step sizes,<br/>and one (the second) has four - quite an unusual quantity to handle<br/>in an EDO.  It&apos;s &quot;angular&quot; enough to probably have a distinctive<br/>flavour, so I&apos;ll probably give it a go.</p><p>IIRC, &quot;strictly proper&quot; means that no interval comprising a given<br/>number of scale steps is smaller than one that comprises more scale<br/>steps; eg no &quot;fourth&quot; is smaller than any &quot;third&quot;.  A very useful<br/>property when writing stretches of parallel multi-part harmony, as<br/>you don&apos;t get gaps widening and contracting uncontrollably.</p><p>I note you chose only 7-note scales; I will open a fresh discussion<br/>on that.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=68290 href="#68290">ðŸ”—</a>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2006 11:10:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;fretlessjazz3000&quot; &lt;bencole.miller@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; investigating the mathematical set up of 19-tone temperment.
