Knopf $23, 262 Pages</p><p>By TED LIBBEY<br/>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</p><p>November 22 2001</p><p>Blame it on Pythagoras. That music&apos;s greatest &quot;riddle&quot; should be about intonation seems, on the<br/>face of it, rather silly. After all, our<br/>ears should tell us when two notes are in tune with one another, shouldn&apos;t they?</p><p>The answer, as Stuart Isacoff makes clear in this charming book, is no, not by a long shot. But<br/>the reason musicians have long<br/>disagreed about tuning is not that their ears have changed so much in the last 21/2 millenniums.<br/>Rather, it&apos;s that their philosophies<br/>have. How great minds--many of them musical, some of them apparently not--were able to disagree<br/>over the nature and meaning of<br/>consonance, and how those disagreements produced problems with the tuning of our musical scale, is<br/>the subject of Isacoff&apos;s book.<br/>And because, once upon a time, music was a subject deemed worthy of scientific, philosophical and<br/>moral inquiry, Isacoff&apos;s treatment<br/>turns out to be as much a whirlwind tour of Western culture&apos;s big ideas as it is a musicological<br/>investigation. To the ancient mind,<br/>music was a readily perceivable representation of cosmic order, its measured perfection and pure<br/>cadences at once a reflection of &quot;the<br/>harmony of the spheres&quot; and a means by which man could be in touch with the divine. The ancients&apos;<br/>assumption that music provided<br/>a connection between the earthly and the celestial was embraced by influential Christian writers<br/>such as St. Augustine (354-430) and<br/>eventually became a fundamental tenet of medieval music theory. A crucial role in this process was<br/>played by the early Christian<br/>philosopher Boethius (470-525), whose &quot;De Musica&quot; reconciled neo-Platonic and Aristotelian<br/>cosmology with Christian belief, and<br/>introduced the Pythagorean concept of musical ratios. Ah, Pythagoras!</p><p>Anyone who has studied geometry knows it was Pythagoras (circa 582 to circa 500 BC) who showed<br/>that the sum of the squares of<br/>the sides of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This same Pythagoras,<br/>observing the effects of vibrating strings,<br/>noticed that beautiful, agreeable sounds were produced when the lengths of the strings were in<br/>certain ratios to one another, such as<br/>3:2 (for the fifth, which refers to the distance, say, between middle C on the piano and the G<br/>above) and 4:3 (for the fourth, say, from<br/>C to F). The Pythagorean concept that consonance depended on simple ratios became the foundation<br/>for the medieval Christian<br/>notion of a universe ordered according to mathematical principles and reflecting the divine<br/>presence, and of music as a potent physical<br/>manifestation of that order--in essence, music as numbers made audible.</p><p>The problem was that this theory, on which early systems of tuning were based, didn&apos;t quite work<br/>in practice. Stacking perfectly tuned<br/>fifths or fourths on top of one another did not produce a satisfactory-sounding octave. Singers<br/>could get around the difficulty, but it<br/>was impossible for instruments with a fixed tuning, especially keyboard instruments, to do so.<br/>Some kind of stretching or shrinking<br/>of the intervals between notes had to occur, and that practice came to be called &quot;temperament.&quot;<br/>Isacoff discusses the various<br/>temperaments that were tried, particularly &quot;just&quot; intonation (which tries to keep some of the<br/>Pythagorean ratios) and &quot;mean-tone&quot;<br/>temperament (in which the fifths are shortened, sacrificing a little more of the ideal),<br/>characterizing their strengths and weaknesses<br/>with great skill.</p><p>The author&apos;s description of how these things sound, though insightful and easily grasped by the<br/>layman, necessarily falls short of the<br/>reality. You simply can&apos;t imagine how good--and bad--a harpsichord in mean-tone temperament can<br/>sound until you&apos;ve heard it<br/>demonstrated. At the Smithsonian, we used to do this by playing &quot;God Save the King&quot; in G major<br/>(marvelously bright and sonorous),<br/>and then a half step lower in F sharp major (where it sounded as though every note were wrong).</p><p>All of this sets the table, of course, for the &quot;equal temperament&quot; tuning in use today, a<br/>compromise system that appeared early in the<br/>1700s and in which only the octave is pure, but every half step between notes is exactly the same<br/>distance from its neighbor. Isacoff<br/>shows us how musicians and philosophers wrestled with the theoretical and theological implications<br/>of this idea for centuries, before<br/>the weight of pragmatism finally won out over dogma.</p><p>The heroes of this story are the composers Adrian Willaert and Vincenzo Galilei (father of the<br/>astronomer), the scientist Daniel<br/>Bernoulli and the composer-theorist Jean Philippe Rameau. The villains--well, let&apos;s not call them<br/>that--those who lined up on what<br/>proved to be the wrong side of the issue, a more numerous lot, include the theorist Gioseffo<br/>Zarlino (on the wrong side of many<br/>issues), the astronomer Johannes Kepler, philosopher-mathematician Rene Descartes, even Sir Isaac<br/>Newton.</p><p>Isacoff looks at the question of temperament primarily from the standpoint of the keyboard, not<br/>surprising considering his expertise<br/>in the piano and its literature. But the real payoff for equal temperament was modulatory freedom,<br/>in instrumental music of all kinds.<br/>It was not just being able to compose a piece of music in any one of the 24 major and minor keys,<br/>and have it sound good--as Bach<br/>did in &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;--but being able to modulate freely within a given piece to any<br/>key: to depart from a &quot;home&quot; key<br/>or tonal center, to take an excursion, and to return. This led to a grand expansion of musical<br/>form and to the psychological and<br/>emotional impact of the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner and so many others. Isacoff<br/>could have said much more<br/>about this than he does, but perhaps that will be the subject of his next book.</p><p>*</p><p>Ted Libbey is the author of &quot;The NPR Guide to Building a Classical CD Collection.&quot;</p><p>For information about reprinting this article, go to <a href="http://www.lats.com">http://www.lats.com</a></p><p>Haresh BAKSHI wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello ALL,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any suggestions regarding the book<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Temperament : The Idea That Solved Music&apos;s Greatest Riddle<br/>&gt; by Stuart M.
