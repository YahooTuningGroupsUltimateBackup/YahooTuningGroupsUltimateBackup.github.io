I&apos;m sure you are correct with<br/> the settings you site, and I am not against septimal intervals, but<br/> are (and others in this thread) you saying that 7/4 (21/16) is ALWAYS<br/> the right choice for the dominant seventh?</p><p> Bob Valentine &gt;&gt;</p><p>While this thread is fairly septimal, this list has been of two minds about<br/>the dominant seventh. In blues, where seventh chords can be built over every<br/>degree, the seventh in the chord is functionally consonant, suggesting a 7/4.<br/> But in classical, functional tonality, the dominant seventh chord is a<br/>dissonance to be resolved, and using 16/9 as the seventh fits the bill for<br/>both smooth voice leading (which is something different to jazz &quot;voicing&quot;)<br/>and the required dissonance. The augmented sixth chord, on the other hand,<br/>can be very close to a 7/4 in meantone, the tuning environment in which the<br/>classical tonal grew up.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>DWolf77309@xx.xxx</h3><span>11/11/1999 9:15:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In einer Nachricht vom 11/11/99 5:09:19 PM (MEZ) Mitteleurop&#xFFFD;ische<br/>Zeitschreibt <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a>:</p><p>&lt;&lt; My view is that the 7/4 seventh is exactly the one used by good string<br/> quartets in the dominant 7th chord leading to the tonic in e.g., Mozart&apos;s<br/> music.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I think that you&apos;ll be disappointed if you look for 7/4 sevenths in real<br/>performances. Try one of the analysis programs available out there --<br/>spectrogram or the (very impressive) PRAAT package.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> Let&apos;s remember that meantone tuning is a possible tuning for keyboards, but<br/> that singers and unfretted strings have never been constrained by such<br/> tuning, except when accompanied by meantone instruments. Meantone tuning,<br/> like any system of fixed tuning, can never be the standard of intonation.<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Meantone tunings were the dominant keyboard tunings in the common practice<br/>tonal era, a time when a capella repertoire was the exception rather than the<br/>rule.  Singers would have been highly unlikely to sing in dissonace with the<br/>continuo instruments, i.e. organs -- mostly in 1/6 comma -- and other<br/>keyboards -- mostly in 1/4 comma.  This is an old theme on the list (and one<br/>on which Paul Erlich actually agree) -- baroque and classical tonal music<br/>_largely_ follows the resources and restrictions of the meantone gamut.<br/>There are important exceptions, but those in the direction of just intonation<br/>are to be found in the choral repertoire prior to this era, and in musics<br/>after and outside of the European common practice period.</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong.  I&apos;m an enthusiast for JI, but the evidence for JI in<br/>common practice repertoire is extremely weak.</p></div>
