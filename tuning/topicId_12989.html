Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2000 6:30:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and with special greetings to Manuel op de Coul, I am<br/>writing to ask if two intervals with small and intriguing integer<br/>ratios have yet received names, and if not, to propose possible names.<br/>Both ratios themselves have already been documented and catalogued in<br/>an article by John Chalmers in _Xenharmonikon_ 17, but I am not sure<br/>if they have been named or related to tuning systems or musical<br/>styles.[1]</p><p>In what follows, I first define the proposed kalisma (9801:9800) and<br/>xenisma (2058:2057), and then present a 12-note multi-prime JI tuning<br/>featuring some complex intervals related to these superparticular<br/>ratios, with a Scala file appended after this main text and notes.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Defining the kalisma (9801:9800) and xenisma (2058:2057)<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The smaller of these two intervals, my proposed _kalisma_, has a ratio<br/>of 9801:9800 (~0.1766 cents), and is equal to the difference between a<br/>large major third or ditone at 12544:9801 (14:11-plus-896:891) and a<br/>diminished fourth at 32:25.</p><p>The other interval, my proposed _xenisma_, has a ratio of 2058:2057<br/>(~0.8414 cents), and is equal to the difference between what might be<br/>termed the supraminor third (following Scala&apos;s latest intnam.par) at<br/>17:14 and the slightly larger 147:121; and also between what I would<br/>term the &quot;submajor third&quot; (or &quot;subditone&quot;) at 21:17 and the slightly<br/>smaller 121:98.[2]</p><p>The term &quot;kalisma&quot; is from the Greek root _kal_, which I understand<br/>means &quot;beautiful,&quot; and might describe the energetic beauty of the<br/>32:25 or 12544:9801 major thirds at around 427 cents, not too far from<br/>Paul Erlich&apos;s point of &quot;maximum entropy&quot; or complexity at 423 cents,<br/>or Dave Keenan&apos;s Golden Mediant at ~422.49 cents.</p><p>The &quot;xenisma,&quot; from the Greek _xen_, &quot;strange,&quot; may suggest the<br/>strange and wonderful qualities in a neo-Gothic setting of supraminor<br/>thirds or supraditones at 17:14 or 147:121, and likewise submajor<br/>thirds or subditones at 21:17 or 121:98. These thirds, although<br/>&quot;alien&quot; to the known medieval polyphony of Western Europe, are a<br/>prominent feature of some favorite neo-Gothic tunings.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>2. A related multi-prime JI tuning<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>To set these two intervals in some musical context, following this<br/>text and notes I am also including a Scala file and keyboard diagram<br/>for what is at least to me a new neo-Gothic just intonation (JI)<br/>tuning using multiple primes, designed for use on a single standard<br/>12-note keyboard. With two such keyboards available, tuning one of<br/>them in this multi-prime JI set and the other in standard 12-note<br/>Pythagorean or 3-limit JI (Eb-G#) might be a nice solution.</p><p>The 12-note JI tuning actually has an 11-note range of Bb-G#,<br/>including two versions of D, one mapped to the usual &quot;D&quot; key of a<br/>12-note keyboard and the other to the &quot;Eb&quot; key. These two keys provide<br/>pure fifths for G and A respectively, and are separated by a comma of<br/>896:891 (~9.6880 cents).</p><p>The basic idea of the tuning is to combine pure 3:2 fifths and 14:11<br/>major thirds or ditones, the latter used as unstable but &quot;relatively<br/>blending&quot; intervals in neo-Gothic styles, much like the usual<br/>Pythagorean 81:64 of Gothic polyphony. These complex major thirds<br/>often, for example, resolve by expanding to a stable fifth.</p><p>While the proposed kalisma and xenisma do not themselves directly<br/>occur in this tuning, the tuning does include the complex large major<br/>third or ditone 12544:9801 (defining the &quot;kalisma&quot; by its difference<br/>from 32:25), and also the complex supraminor third 147:121 and<br/>submajor third 121:98 (defining the &quot;xenisma&quot; by their differences<br/>from 17:14 and 21:17 respectively).</p><p>In this neo-Gothic multi-prime JI scheme, the 12544:9801 (~427.1959<br/>cents) occurs as a 14:11 major third or ditone enlarged by a comma of<br/>896:891, or as an 81:64 Pythagorean major third or ditone enlarged by<br/>two such commas -- the 896:891 defining the difference between the<br/>81:64 (four pure 3:2 fifths) and the 14:11.</p><p>Here a crude lattice diagram, with an enthusiastic and appreciative<br/>invitation for more refined and sophisticated versions to the various<br/>exponents of this craft on the Tuning List, may be helpful.</p><p>Notes connected in horizontal rows form chains of pure 3:2 fifths,<br/>while diagonally connected major thirds (e.g. F0-A+1, E+1-G#+2) form<br/>pure 14:11 ratios, also expressible as the classic mediant between 5:4<br/>and 9:7, or (5+9):(4+7).</p><p>     F#+2 -  C#+2  -  G#+2<br/>    /        /        /<br/>   /        /        /<br/>  D+1  -   A+1  -   E+1  -  B+1<br/> /        /        /        /<br/>/        /        /        /<br/>Bb0  -  F0   -   C0   -   G0   -  D0</p><p>In the following discussion, as in the diagram, note numbers such as<br/>&quot;Bb0&quot; or &quot;F#2&quot; refer to the number of 896:891 commas by which a note<br/>is raised from its usual Pythagorean position, rather than to octave<br/>numbers (my accustomed use).</p><p>The 12544:9801 occurs between the lower of the two versions of D and<br/>the F#, or D0-F#2, a Pythagorean major third enlarged by two commas of<br/>896:891.</p><p>Comparing the size of this 12544:9801 major third with that of the<br/>very slightly larger 5-based diminished fourth at 32:25 or 12544:9800<br/>(~427.3726 cents) yields the proposed kalisma at 9801:9800.</p><p>In this same 12-note tuning, the complex diminished fourth or submajor<br/>third of 121:98 (~364.9841 cents) occurs as the difference between two<br/>14:11 major thirds at ~417.5080 cents each and a 2:1 octave, as at<br/>C#2-F0 or G#2-C0. This interval differs from the slightly larger 21:17<br/>(~365.8255 cents) by the proposed xenisma of 2058:2057.</p><p>Similarly, a complex supraminor third at 147:121, equal to a usual 9:8<br/>Pythagorean whole-tone plus a large chromatic semitone of 392:363,<br/>occurs at F0-G#2 (F0-G0-G#2) and Bb-C#2 (Bb0-C0-C#2). This interval is<br/>larger than the 17:14 by the same xenisma of 2058:2057.</p><p>More generally, the proposed kalisma and xenisma may illustrate how<br/>stylistic approaches such as neo-Gothic may provide musical contexts<br/>lending new meaning to complex integer ratios catalogued by devoted<br/>xenharmonicists such as John Chalmers and Manuel op de Coul.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. John Chalmers, &quot;The Number of 23-Prime-LImit Superparticular Ratios<br/>Less than 10,000,000,&quot; _Xenharmonikon_ 17:111-115 (Spring 1998), where<br/>in Table 1 the 9801:9800, here proposed as the &quot;kalisma,&quot; is listed<br/>under &quot;Ratios of 11&quot; as ratio number 186 (p. 112); 2058:2057, here<br/>proposed as the &quot;xenisma&quot; is listed under &quot;Ratios of 17&quot; as ratio<br/>number 148 (p. 113). As Chalmers explains, the ratio numbers of the<br/>first column of the table are &quot;the order of generation numbers of the<br/>ratios as they are found by my program&quot; written in the Microsoft<br/>QuickBASIC language and run on a Macintosh SE/30 computer.</p><p>2. The latest version of Scala&apos;s intnam.par file lists 17/14 as<br/>&quot;supraminor third,&quot; but does not list the 21/17, for which I propose<br/>the name &quot;submajor third.&quot; The latter name seems both descriptive and<br/>logical, since the 17/14 and 21/17 together form a pure 3/2 fifth, a<br/>relationship fitting the symmetrical terms &quot;supraminor&quot; and<br/>&quot;submajor.&quot; In more neo-medieval terms, I have referred to these two<br/>intervals or nearby approximations as the &quot;suprasemitone&quot; and<br/>&quot;subditone.&quot;</p><p>          -------- Scala file begins on next line of text -------</p><p>! neogji12.scl<br/>!<br/>Neo-Gothic 12-note JI tuning (primes 2/3/7/11) F-F with Eb key as D+1<br/>12<br/>!<br/> 392/363<br/> 9/8<br/> 147/121<br/> 14/11<br/> 4/3<br/> 63/44<br/> 3/2<br/> 196/121<br/> 27/16<br/> 56/33<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>    ---------- Scale file concluded on previous line of text -------</p><p>Here is a keyboard diagram of the octave F-F in this tuning:</p><p>    392:363    147:121     4:3             196:121   56:33<br/>    133.061    336.971   498.045           835.016  915.553<br/>      f#         g#        bb                c#&apos;      d+1&apos;<br/> _133.1|70.8_133.1|80.5_80.5|123.4_      _133.1|70.8_9.6|203.9_<br/> f          g          a          b      c&apos;         d&apos;        e&apos;    f&apos;<br/>1:1        9:8       14:11      63:44   3:2       27:16     21:11  2:1<br/> 0       203.910    417.508   621.418 701.955    905.865  1121.885 1200<br/>     9:8       112:99      9:8     22:21      9:8      112:99   22:21<br/>   203.910    213.598    203.910  80.537    203.920   213.598  80.537</p><p>This is, in effect, a tuning over an 11-note range (Bb-G#) with two<br/>versions of D, one mapped to the usual &quot;D&quot; key and the other to the<br/>&quot;Eb&quot; key.
