Erv noticed that all hexanies have the melodic sequence c b a b c d, where the intervals a, b c and d are not necessarily different. A consequence of this finding is that hexanies can be defined in ET without concern of the possible JI interpretation of the generating tetrad. BTW, the generators can be tetrachords or even a set or irrational numbers -- e.pi.phi.sqr(2) is a perfectly good hexany generator.</p><p>Fortunately I was able to locate some of my notes and re-coded my hexanies in ETs program from Fortran to Basic and ran it. Here&apos;s the output for 12-tet. The hard part is figuring out how to get a non-redundant list, but the number here agrees with my previous work and Erv&apos;s list (the algorithm is ultimately from Erv, of course).</p><p>Getting the generating tetrad is not as hard as I thought. If the generalized hexany has the interval sequence c b a b c d, the generator tetrad is 0 b c + b a + 2*b + c. Take sums two at a time to get b   c + b   a + 2*b + c   c + 2*b   a + 3*b + c   a + 3*b + 2*c, sort in ascending order and subtract the smallest term from all so that the hexany starts on 0.</p><p>The list:</p><p>#                HEXANY INTERVALS  GENERATING HEXAD    HEXANY   ET=  12<br/> 1               1  1  1  1  1  7                    0  1  2  4                          0  1  2  3  4  5<br/> 2               1  1  2  1  1  6                    0  1  2  5                          0  1  2  4  5  6<br/> 3               1  1  3  1  1  5                    0  1  2  6                          0  1  2  5  6  7<br/> 4               1  1  4  1  1  4                    0  1  2  7                          0  1  2  6  7  8<br/> 5               1  2  1  2  1  5                    0  2  3  6                          0  1  3  4  6  7<br/> 6               1  2  2  2  1  4                    0  2  3  7                          0  1  3  5  7  8<br/> 7               1  2  3  2  1  3                    0  2  3  8                          0  1  3  6  8  9<br/> 8               2  1  1  1  2  5                    0  1  3  5                          0  2  3  4  5  7<br/> 9               2  1  2  1  2  4                    0  1  3  6                          0  2  3  5  6  8<br/> 10              2  1  3  1  2  3                    0  1  3  7                          0  2  3  6  7  9<br/> 11              2  2  1  2  2  3                    0  2  4  7                          0  2  4  5  7  9<br/> 12              2  2  2  2  2  2                    0  2  4  8                          0  2  4  6  8  10<br/> 13              3  1  1  1  3  3                    0  1  4  6                          0  3  4  5  6  9<br/> 14              3  1  2  1  3  2                    0  1  4  7                          0  3  4  6  7  10<br/> 15              3  2  1  2  3  1                    0  2  5  8                          0  3  5  6  8  11<br/> 16              4  1  1  1  4  1                    0  1  5  7                          0  4  5  6  7  11</p><p>The inversion of a hexany-generating tetrad produces the same hexany as the prime form. However, the 12-tet complement of a hexany is not always a hexany. In the above table, hexanies 6, 9 and 14 have complements that are not hexanies. I&apos;m not a dodecaphonic theorist, but one might look at Allen Forte&apos;s treatment of these hexanies as hexads. IIRC, some of the tetrad generators are Babbitt&apos;s &quot;All-Combinatorial Source Sets,&quot; but I don&apos;t recall which.</p><p>There are a lot of things one can do with hexanies---e.g., joining them by common triads to create 12-tone scales is a fruitful approach. Erv called the resulting scales &quot;flankers.&quot; Another approach is to construct the <a href="http://1.3.5.9">1.3.5.9</a> hexany and transpose it by 3/1 or 9/3 to generate a major scale between the two conjoined hexanies, then harmonize it according to hexany rules with 1.3.5, 1.3.9, 1.5.9 and 3.5.9 triads and their inversions in 12-tet. The result sounds rather modal and fresh compared to the usual treatment.</p><p> Erv conceived hexanies both as scales and as frameworks for modulation. In fact, he discovered them and the other CPS while pondering what pitch bases (aka keys) I should use for my JI tables back in 1968. So, one could modulate a 7 limit scale around the pitches of the <a href="http://1.3.5.7">1.3.5.7</a> or other hexany. Erv diagrammed the result of modulating the Partch gamut around the 1.3.5.7.9.11 20-any.</p><p>I haven&apos;t reinvestigated the tempered 20-anies , as I haven&apos;t located all my notes from the late 70&apos;s. As I recall, the procedure was analogous to the hexany case, but avoiding redundancy was harder as was the problem of extracting the hexad generator, but I do recall that hexanies or any hexatonic scale can be used as 20-any generators, though the resulting 20-any may be degenerate with fewer than 20 different notes. This is not necessarily a problem as some notes have dual functions and be interpreted as different notes in different 20-any tetrads. This is not too different from double emploi in traditional harmony. In fact, Erv tuned a set of tubulongs to a redundant 80-any with only 56 tones. (I think it was the 1.3.5.7.9.11.13.15,  4 at a time 80-any).</p><p>--john</p></div><h3>John H.
