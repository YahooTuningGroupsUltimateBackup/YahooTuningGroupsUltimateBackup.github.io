I had only<br/>changed my ancient use of the term &quot;proper&quot; for &quot;sui generis&quot; to avoid<br/>misunderstanding.</p><p>The Robert Walker&apos;s post 21421 led me to the Joseph Monzo&apos;s propriety page.</p><p>I think that the use of the term &quot;class&quot; in that page could be<br/>inappropriate.  Since its use suggests a mathematical sense it seems it<br/>might be used strictly in that sense. Assuming that, it would make no sense<br/>to write</p><p>   &lt;&lt; Scales in which two or more pairs of interval<br/>      classes contain identical members are Proper &gt;&gt;</p><p>since two classes by (mathematical) definition could never have an<br/>identical member. The &quot;Proper&quot; category would be so empty.</p><p>Now I would like to add this comment : even if we change the term &quot;classes&quot;<br/>by &quot;columns in the interval matrix&quot;, the idea itself, as expressed, would<br/>be contradictory.</p><p>Before to show that contradiction I first write what I presume could be a<br/>mathematical formulation of that definition over the interval matrix where<br/>i and j are column indexes :</p><p>Let x be an interval in column Ci and y be an interval in column Cj. Then<br/>for any index i and j and, within the designated columns, any interval x<br/>and y,</p><p>  &quot;Strictly proper&quot;  &lt;==&gt;  &quot;i &lt; j  implies  x &lt; y&quot;</p><p>           &quot;Proper&quot;  &lt;==&gt;  &quot;i &lt; j  implies  x &lt; y  or  x = y&quot;</p><p>         &quot;Improper&quot;  &lt;==&gt;  &quot;not Proper&quot;</p><p>The precedent formulation was contradictory for we could have both in the<br/>same scale one case where x = y and another case where x &gt; y (overlapping),<br/>while the definition appears only as being -- apparently a specification<br/>from &quot;Strictly proper&quot; -- simply related to the existence of some x = y<br/>cases : what is an illogism.</p><p>After this formulation, a scale could be both &quot;Proper&quot; and &quot;Improper&quot;.<br/>Proper for having a non-empty columns intersection (x = y case) and<br/>Improper for having an overlapping (x &gt; y case), since it is also written :</p><p>&lt;&lt; Scales with overlapping [..] are Improper &gt;&gt;</p><p>Since the contradiction appears at definition level, it would remain even<br/>if there wouldn&apos;t exist any case where we have both overlapping (x &gt; y) and<br/>ambiguity (x = y). The definition would have to refer at a proof or to<br/>mention minimally a conjecture about a presumed incompatibility between<br/>overlapping and ambiguity.</p><p>The following example shows both overlapping and ambiguity :</p><p>   0 4 8  9 12 16 20 21   = 4 4 1 3 4 4 1<br/>   0 4 5  8 12 16 17 21   = 4 1 3 4 4 1 4<br/>   0 1 4  8 12 13 17 21   = 1 3 4 4 1 4 4<br/>   0 3 7 11 12 16 20 21   = 3 4 4 1 4 4 1<br/>   0 4 8  9 13 17 18 21   = 4 4 1 4 4 1 3<br/>   0 4 5  9 13 14 17 21   = 4 1 4 4 1 3 4<br/>   0 1 5  9 10 13 17 21   = 1 4 4 1 3 4 4</p><p>The pseudo-classes C3 = {8,9,11} and C4 = {10,12,13} overlaps, thus it&apos;s<br/>Improper. There exist also ambiguity since 8 belongs to C3 and C2 =<br/>{4,5,7,8}. Is it also Proper?</p><p>If someone prefers an historical example, the greek enharmonic genus<br/>corresponds to (1 1 8 4 1 1 8) in 24-tet. It&apos;s there an &quot;extremely&quot;<br/>Improper genus while its 24-tet version presents a slight ambiguity : 12<br/>belongs both to</p><p>   C2 = {2,5,9,12}  and  C5 = {12,15,19,22}</p><p>In particular, we have by rotation these (Aristoxenian) scales</p><p>   0 8 (12) 13 14  22  23 24   = 8 4 1 1 8 1 1<br/>   0 1   2  10 11 (12) 20 24   = 1 1 8 1 1 8 4</p><p>Naturally, JI versions or any coherent version avoid this ambiguity.

The main property of a coherent musical system appears<br/>to me the congruence relation between intervals and degrees, what may be<br/>expressed by the existence of a (degree) function obeying to the following<br/>relation :</p><p>   D(x * y) =  D(x) + D(y)</p><p>         -- where * is  multiplication with ratios and<br/>            addition with log (ratios) like cents --</p><p>what is common to many approachs and particularly explicit in Z-module<br/>context. An equivalence relation is not forcely a congruence relation but<br/>it is implied by the congruence.</p><p>A Proper scale which is not a Strictly Proper scale cannot be part of any<br/>coherent musical system (in mathematical sense). There are only Strictly<br/>Proper scales and &quot;unambiguous&quot; scales defined by Robert Walker having<br/>chance to be part of such coherent musical systems.</p><p>However we find often as Simply Proper scales some degenerated N-tet<br/>versions of coherent systems. A degenerated version is never an algebraic<br/>structure but only an approximative image of the primeval set without the<br/>primeval relations giving the algebraic structure.</p><p>The 53-tet versions of the Zarlino and Pythagore scales</p><p>   0 9 17 22 31 39 48 53   = 9 8 5 9 8 9 5<br/>   0 9 18 22 31 40 49 53   = 9 9 4 9 9 9 4</p><p>are part of coherent systems which have all the algebraic properties of<br/>their corresponding JI version while their common 12-tet version</p><p>   0 2 4 5 7 9 11 12   = 2 2 1 2 2 2 1</p><p>is a degenerated image having not in itself an algebraic consistensy. The<br/>problem is not simply the ambiguity</p><p>   augmented fouth = diminued fifth = 6</p><p>in 12-tet while the corresponding values 26 and 27 are distinct in 53-tet,<br/>what  we could write in term of degree function</p><p>   D(26) = 4<br/>   D(27) = 5</p><p>What would be D(6) in 12-tet?</p><p>However it&apos;s there only something revealing a much deeper inconsistency.<br/>For instance, in the 12-tet version, there is no explicit reason for which<br/>we cannot split the tone 2 in two half-tone 1, since 1 and 2 exist in the<br/>set and</p><p>   1 + 1 = 2</p><p>but explicitely the value 4 + 4 don&apos;t exist in the t53-Pythagore set and<br/>the value 5 + 5 don&apos;t exist in the t53-Zarlino set.</p><p>There exist an algebraic structure in the t12 set : the cyclic group Z/12.<br/>Simply that structure don&apos;t correspond to the presumed major scale<br/>structure having to be epimorph to Z/7.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Now about the Strictly Proper sense.</p><p>When I wrote about 15 years ago an empirical algorithm permitting to<br/>produce an ordered list of the gammier structures I had implicitely<br/>introduced the &quot;Strictly Proper&quot; property. Subsequently I sought to give an<br/>axiomatic formulation at the gammier structure. I found about (what I can<br/>name now) the &quot;Strictly Proper&quot; property that it was not resulting from<br/>more fundamental properties (which I retained as axioms). That property<br/>would have to be itself an axiom : what it appears to me unjustifiable at<br/>the paradigmatic level.</p><p>It&apos;s why I released my algorithm from that constraint.

That permits to open new<br/>doors. I shall begin with short remarks before to talk about main subjects.</p><p>--1--</p><p>I forgot to note in my precedent post I was very glad to see that Joseph<br/>Monzo used the interval matrix with scales. That will facilitate<br/>eventually, as reference, the presentation of my algebraic structures.</p><p>--2--</p><p>You wrote</p><p>&lt;&lt; Now consider the set I(s) of all the intervals between<br/>   elements of s. Then my definition of an unambiguous scale s<br/>   is one in which every element of I(s) belongs to only one<br/>   of the A(s,i) &gt;&gt;</p><p>I note the term &quot;unambiguous&quot; is not used only with improper scales. It is<br/>much more simple. Thus the unambiguous scales are synonymous with scales<br/>having &quot;equivalence classes&quot; (so potentially &quot;congruence classes&quot;). That<br/>replaces the barbarism &quot;non-simply-proper&quot; scales I was using.</p><p>--3--</p><p>I would like first to signal I made an error in my precedent post. When I<br/>wrote</p><p>   &lt;&lt; even if we change the term &quot;classes&quot;<br/>      by &quot;columns in the interval matrix&quot; &gt;&gt;</p><p>I had in head your precedent post using the Dan Stearn&apos;s presentation of<br/>the scales obtained by rotation. Since I was refering to interval matrix<br/>used by Joseph Monzo rather than the Dan Stearn&apos;s presentation I would have<br/>had to talk about diagonals rather than columns.</p><p>Besides, the interval matrix applied to a scale corresponds to a torus<br/>where the classes -- or pseudo-classes if ambiguous scales -- are circles<br/>on the torus : what is related to diagonals in the matrix.</p><p>--- Use of ordering ---</p><p>You wrote</p><p>&lt;&lt; For a scale S, define A(s,1) = set of all the single<br/>   step intervals of s. Define A(s,2) = set of all two step<br/>   intervals, and so on. &gt;&gt;</p><p>and briefly</p><p>&lt;&lt; Define A(s,k) = set of all the k step intervals of s. &gt;&gt;</p><p>As long as your subsets A(s,k) refer directly to a scale s</p><p>   -- rather than uniquely to the generated intervals I(s)</p><p>there exist a canonical total ordering =&lt; on the subsets which may be<br/>simply defined by the total ordering =&lt; on the indexes</p><p>   A(s,i) =&lt; A(s,j)  &lt;--&gt;  i =&lt; j</p><p>   -- what implies the expression &lt;&lt; k step interval &gt;&gt;<br/>      is well defined (I discuss that forward) --</p><p>This well ordering has the following property : min A(s,k) and max A(s,k)<br/>respect the standard ordering =&lt; on intervals</p><p>   min A(s,i) =&lt; min A(s,j)  &lt;--&gt;  i =&lt; j<br/>   max A(s,i) =&lt; max A(s,j)  &lt;--&gt;  i =&lt; j</p><p>So I think there is no need to use another ordering if the goal is simply<br/>to define &quot;Strictly proper&quot; and &quot;Proper&quot;. Besides it may be hard for most<br/>people to manipulate partial ordering lattices of subsets.</p><p>Let x be an interval of A(s,i) and y be an interval of A(s,j) where</p><p>   A(s,i) &lt; A(s,j)    -- what is equivalent to i &lt; j --</p><p>then the scale s in &quot;strictly proper&quot; if (for any x and any y) we have</p><p>   x &lt; y</p><p>and the scale s is &quot;proper&quot; if (for any x and any y) we don&apos;t NEVER have</p><p>   x &gt; y</p><p>--- Classes on set I ---</p><p>It&apos;s a more sophisticated problem to define the classes in a set I(s) if s<br/>itself is unknown. We cannot use the steps in s and the expression</p><p>   &lt;&lt; k step interval &gt;&gt;</p><p>is no more a well defined object. We have to use another concept I name<br/>&quot;atom&quot; which corresponds to &quot;step&quot; only if the set is consistent.</p><p>Let I be an ordered set of intervals in the first octave. By definition, an<br/>&quot;atom&quot; of I is any interval k greater than unison that cannot be splitted<br/>in two other intervals x and y greater than unison, where x &lt; k and y &lt; k.</p><p>For instance, the sets I(s) corresponding to</p><p>   s1 = &lt;1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8&gt;</p><p>   s2 = [0 9 17 22 31 39 48]</p><p>   s3 = [0 2 4 5 7 9 11]</p><p>are I(s1) I(s2) I(s3) = &apos;&lt;s1\s1&gt; &apos;[s2\s2] &apos;[s3\s3] =</p><p>   &lt;1 16/15 10/9 9/8 32/27 6/5 5/4 4/3 27/20 45/32 .. (reverse) &gt;</p><p>   [0 5 8 9 13 14 17 22 23 26 27 31 36 39 40 44 45 48]</p><p>   [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]</p><p>and the atoms &apos;a&apos;(s\s) are</p><p>   &lt;16/15 10/9 9/8&gt;</p><p>   [5 8 9]</p><p>   [1]</p><p>So the interval sets I(s1) and I(s2) are consistent relatively to the<br/>scales s1 and s2 for the atoms of I(s1) and I(s2) correspond respectively<br/>to the steps in s1 and s2. The third interval set I(s3) is not consistent<br/>relatively to the scale s3 for the unique atom [1] of I(s3) don&apos;t<br/>correspond to the steps [1 2] in S3. However the set I(s3) is consistent<br/>relatively to the dodecatonic scale.</p><p>--- Property of atoms ---</p><p>I signal here an interesting property concerning atoms and chordic<br/>generators in consistent systems. The atoms of an interval set S generated<br/>by a chordic generator G (which may be a scale) are the atoms of the finite<br/>differences on the cyclical-ordered generator. What simplifies not only<br/>calculation with computer but permits to design systems easily without<br/>computer. For instance about the gammier 9 containing the Zarlino mode :</p><p>   G = &lt;1 3 5 9 15&gt;</p><p>   S = &apos;&lt;G\G&gt; = &lt;1 16/15 10/9 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 .. (reverse) &gt;</p><p>   A(S) = a &lt;S&gt; = &lt;16/15 10/9 9/8&gt;</p><p>   A(G) = &apos;ad&apos; &lt;1 3 5 9 15&gt;<br/>          &apos;ad &lt;1 9 5 3 15&gt;<br/>          &apos;a &lt;9/8 10/9 6/5 5/4 16/15&gt;<br/>          &apos; &lt;9/8 10/9 16/15&gt;</p><p>          &lt;16/15 10/9 9/8&gt;</p><p>--- Congruity axiom ---</p><p>I already shown how to define the degree function in the context of<br/>infinite lattices (Z-modules). The problem, generally bad addressed by the<br/>tenants of the infinite approach (say Hellegouarch), is to well determine<br/>the finite sets for which the class algebra is optimally reflected in a<br/>non-closed interval algebra.</p><p>The congruence expressed by the degree function may be obtained in<br/>non-closed finite sets by obeying the congruity axiom which stands that all<br/>complete factorization* of a same interval (in atoms of the set) have the<br/>same number of atoms. It is the way I introduce unambiguouness in finite<br/>context.</p><p>(*) These factorizations are represented by parenthesed<br/>    expressions or binary trees since the composition law<br/>    is only partial in finite sets.</p><p>--- Regularity axiom ---</p><p>I terminate by this remark : the only axiom I retained concerning the<br/>ordering in the gammier theory is the regularity axiom which stands that<br/>for any atom x we have to obey at x &lt; 2/x. That eliminates torsion in<br/>structures.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=21758 href="#21758">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2001 9:27:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Pierre,</p><p>Thanks, I also like working on definitions, in fact in a way that was<br/>my area of research when I was at university - research into a new<br/>axiom system for set theory.</p><p>&quot;<br/>I note the term &quot;unambiguous&quot; is not used only with improper scales.
