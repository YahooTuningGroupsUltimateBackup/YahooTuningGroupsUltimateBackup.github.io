This measured phenomenon<br/>appears to rather complicate the prospect of constructing<br/>accurate mathematical descriptions of the frequency spectra<br/>actually perceived, when we speak only in terms of tones<br/>(rationally describable, or otherwise) as sinusoidal in<br/>nature only, thus failing to account for timbre due to the<br/>presence of harmonics (externally *or* &quot;internally&quot; generated).</p><p>I take it, then, that you confer with the prior conditions of:<br/>provided that they are (1) musicians; and (2) &quot;know&quot; what<br/>a &quot;fifth&quot; is; and (3) are capable of tuning by ear?</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; But what of the many *other* ratios which are commonly<br/>&gt; referred to as &quot;JI&quot; ratios. What of 16/15, 9/8, 10/9, 6/5,<br/>&gt; 5/4, 4/3, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 16/9, 15/8? Would you say the<br/>&gt; same about those ratios? What about their strictly sinusoidal<br/>&gt; cases (as opposed to harmonic &quot;cues&quot; being present in the<br/>&gt; tones)? What about the (entirely) &quot;harmonic&quot; case (where<br/>&gt; *all* harmonics of each tone were present)?</p><p>DK:<br/>The perceptual definition of just _must_ consider the context.<br/>What is just in one context may not be so in another. ...</p><p>JG: Here I add DK&apos;s statements in ATL #15836:</p><p>&lt;&lt; The important point is that whether or not an interval or chord<br/>is &apos;justly intoned&apos;, is not a mathematical property, it&apos;s about<br/>how something _sounds_! &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt; It may be a &quot;JI tuning&quot; (although most are not) but that<br/>does not make all the intervals it contains &quot;JI intervals&quot;.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>JG: Here I add DK&apos;s statement in ATL #16006 relating to chords:</p><p>&lt;&lt; I did mean as dyads or I would have said otherwise. But when they<br/>appear in chords, how could you tell if they were consonant, or merely<br/>dissonances in consonant chords? i.e. how can you apportion consonance<br/>among the components of a chord, except by listening to them<br/>separately? But I perceive an otonal chord as more consonant than the<br/>sum of its parts. &gt;&gt;</p><p>JG: Followed by the statement:</p><p>&lt;&lt; But one can certainly tell if a pitch is justly intoned in the context of a chord, by varying it slightly either way and listening<br/>for beats. &gt;&gt;</p><p>JG: In regards to a possible concept of &quot;melodic consonance&quot;<br/>related to &quot;just-ness&quot;, DK stated in ATL #16006:</p><p>&lt;&lt; I really don&apos;t think there is<br/>such a thing as melodic consonance. I _might_ be able to stretch the<br/>concept of justness to pure melody (in which case the claimed ratios<br/>need to be very simple and don&apos;t need any great accuracy), but melodic<br/>consonance? &gt;&gt;</p><p>It is interesting that such a restriction of the scope<br/>of &quot;consonance&quot; (which makes some sense from a certain<br/>standpoint) seems to differentiate perceptions of<br/>&quot;just-ness&quot; from that of Terhardt&apos;s &quot;tonal affinity&quot;<br/>(said to be largely concerned with *consecutive* tones).</p><p>JG: Dan Stearn&apos;s response to DK&apos;s ATL #15836 (in ATL #15841)<br/>appears to raise some interesting points, which speak to the<br/>scope of which the phrase &quot;just intonation&quot; as discussed may<br/>be realistically applied.</p><p>DS stated: &lt;&lt; all this assumes NO musical context or aesthetic/<br/>artistic intention whatsoever... &gt;&gt;</p><p>DS&apos;s first point seems to relate to stylistic choice, and<br/>whether the presence of such choices should be considered<br/>to serve to either - qualify music as produced to<br/>(or to disqualify it from) - the status of &quot;just intonation&quot;</p><p>&lt;&lt; I mean if I play &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in octaves at the piano<br/>is it not justly intoned? Is it now &quot;just intonation&quot; music! &gt;&gt;</p><p>DS&apos;s second point seems to relate to pitch uncertainty in time:<br/>&lt;&lt; Or how about a piece or body of music composed in strict JI<br/>that zips along at a rapid enough clip as to render<br/>even sizable tuning errors all but a moot point...<br/>is this music any less JI than some long drawn-out, easy as pie<br/>musical demonstration of the same justly intoned intervals? &gt;&gt;</p><p>JG: DS&apos;s second point above raises an issue which upon<br/>consideration would seem to qualify the distinction of<br/>JI to the cases where our &quot;aural minds&quot; have the opportunity<br/>in time to *accurately discern* the relationships between<br/>combinations of tones which are determined by &quot;listening<br/>for beats&quot; (as DK stated in ATL #16006 quoted above). Thus,<br/>one&apos;s ability to make a determination of &quot;just-ness&quot; would<br/>appear to be limited by the listening context, requiring<br/>the opportunity to compare a small number of [assumed to<br/>be &quot;complex&quot; (with some/all harmonics present)] tones for<br/>a time period adequate for the resolution of a perception<br/>(however gathered) &quot;purity&quot; and/or &quot;perfectly in tune&quot;.</p><p>This would seem to restrict the application of such a<br/>definition of the term &quot;just&quot; to those special circumstances<br/>in which the listener is able to make such a (whether it be<br/>subjective, or persuasively objective) determination, and<br/>not necessarily to some examples of such scale-pitches<br/>when combined for short time intervals, where the perceptions<br/>resulting from such scale-pitches combined as &quot;drones&quot; may<br/>not apply in a dynamic musical context of short-duration notes.</p><p>JG: In relation to pitch-ratios containing large valued integers,<br/>DK stated in ATL #15836:</p><p>&lt;&lt; 12544:9801 isn&apos;t any kind of JI interval. Not because it has large<br/>numbers in it, but because it isn&apos;t close enough to any ratio with small enough numbers. It might by accident be a consequence of some<br/>JI tuning, but there is no way it could be called a just interval.<br/>You only have to listen to it, and then try varying the pitch<br/>of one of the notes slightly in both directions to hear that<br/>there is nothing &quot;just&quot; about it. &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt; If an interval &quot;has a quality much like those of tempered (irrational) ratios surrounding it&quot;, this is precisely what<br/>defines it as not just! &gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt;MS: Possibly one might use capitalization to suggest a difference<br/>&gt;in nuance between a &quot;just&quot; interval (any integer ratio) and a Just<br/>&gt;interval (an interval with a _small_ integer ratio readily tuneable<br/>&gt;by ear by a locking in of partials).</p><p>&lt;&lt; No. This would be a complete departure from history. Motivated apparently by mathematics (or numerology) rather than<br/>art or aesthetics.<br/>just = Just = pure = tuneable by ear  &gt;&gt;</p><p>DK(continued):<br/>If we are asking whether<br/>a particular scale is just, I suggest we accept an interval as just if<br/>it can be tuned by listening for slow beats in any context that can be<br/>provided by the rest of the scale.</p><p>JG: By &quot;any context&quot;, do you mean (in the most general sense)<br/>&quot;all possible combinations of the *complex* tones of a given<br/>scale with all of the other *complex* tones of that same scale&quot;?</p><p>DK:<br/>Then if the scale&apos;s<br/>just-interval-graph is connected, (where vertices are the pitches and<br/>edges are the just intervals), I&apos;d call the scale just.</p><p>JG: Sounds interesting! Do you have graphic examples of<br/>the &quot;just-interval-graph&quot; of any particular scales?</p><p>&gt; JG: When I choose colors in PaintShop Pro, I use what I like,<br/>&gt; as well as what translates in ways that I like to a printed page.<br/>&gt; I do not think about &quot;purity&quot; (though there may be those<br/>&gt; who do). It seems highly subjective to me ...</p><p>DK:<br/>It may be simply that no one has ever pointed out to you what pure<br/>colours are. As in &quot;Look at this colour chart. Here are some examples<br/>of pure colours. Now these other ones are colours of the same hue but<br/>different degrees of purity (or saturation). This one is really close<br/>to pure. So now do you get what we mean by &quot;pure&quot;? Do you think this<br/>one is pure?&quot; And so on.</p><p>We can do the same thing to teach people what we mean by &quot;just&quot;<br/>for harmony. Maybe twanging a few guitar strings simultaneously and<br/>varing the pitch of one string while saying stuff like &quot;Hear how<br/>there&apos;s a sort of beating effect that slows down and then speeds up<br/>again. When it&apos;s so slow that you can only tell its there by listening<br/>for longer than any sustained harmonies you intend to use in actual<br/>music, then that&apos;s called &quot;just&quot;.</p><p>JG: So, it appears that you consider that a listening time-<br/>window &quot;longer than any sustained harmonies you intend to use<br/>in actual music&quot; which is (in the least) a long enough time<br/>period within which a listener can perceive whatever<br/>&quot;beating effects&quot; between the tones in question are present<br/>are essential conditions for the &quot;aural mind&apos;s&quot; determination<br/>of &quot;just-ness&quot; to take place?</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; But I am more interested in what *you* consider as &quot;pure&quot;<br/>&gt; *sound*.</p><p>DK:<br/>Now wait a minute. I&apos;m concerned that you think there is some value<br/>judgment (good/bad) involved in the use of the word &quot;pure&quot; here. There<br/>isn&apos;t. In both colour and harmony (note: not merely sound) the word<br/>&quot;pure&quot; has a technical meaning that has very little to do with the<br/>word&apos;s common usage. Same for &quot;just&quot;. In this context &quot;pure&quot; is simply<br/>a synonym for &quot;just&quot;.</p><p>JG: But you state (also quoted below within your text):</p><p>&lt;&lt; Yes it would be different (simpler) if we were painters. &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt; We are far from that in modelling perception of harmony. &gt;&gt;</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; Therefore (even with interesting numbers), the nature of the<br/>&gt; (subject-ive) subject of perception seems to preclude us from<br/>&gt; declaring a democratic (statistical) or physical evidentiary<br/>&gt; (speculative conceptual) objective &quot;knowledge claim&quot; in the<br/>&gt; matter. Would it be different (or simpler) if we were painters?</p><p>Yes it would be different (simpler) if we were painters. Mathematical<br/>modelling of colour perception is essentially complete and we have<br/>internationally accepted standards based on it. We can now give<br/>precise mathematical specifications of what we mean by particular<br/>colours. Obviously we had to rely on the consensus (or statistical<br/>combination of opinions) of experts to give names to particular<br/>regions of mathematically-modelled colour space.</p><p>We are far from that in modelling perception of harmony. The time<br/>dimension seems to make it difficult for one thing. The problem is<br/>that people are trying to give a mathematical definition of &quot;just&quot;,<br/>way too early in the piece and failing to recognise the<br/>contradictions they create.</p><p>Where do people get this idea that merely because something is<br/>subjective one has to accept that anyone&apos;s version of the concept is<br/>as good as anyone elses. This is nonsense.</p><p>JG: Perhaps from the inherent paradox of - where our sensory<br/>perceptions are concerned, the &quot;data&quot; gathered, from &quot;square-<br/>one&quot;, seems impossible to differentiate from the elements that<br/>our own (subjective) &quot;massaging&quot; and &quot;noise&quot; interject into<br/>the reported &quot;values&quot; of such &quot;data&quot;, for whatever reasons.</p><p>Therefore, it seems as troublesome to speak of &quot;objectivity&quot;<br/>arrived at by an ongoing &quot;concensus&quot; derived from communications<br/>describing sensory impressions (subjectively) arrived at, where<br/>such a conception of &quot;objectivity&quot; must (inherently) be arrived<br/>at based upon a communicated &quot;agreement&quot; of inherently (subjective)<br/>experiences.</p><p>Could we also endeavor to agree on satisfying definitions of<br/>&quot;what it means&quot; to perceive the quality of a sound(s) as being<br/>&quot;soft&quot;, &quot;fuzzy&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, &quot;big&quot;, &quot;bouncy&quot;, &quot;fat&quot;, &quot;rich&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;?</p><p>DK:<br/>Actually I think it derives<br/>from some of the popular fallacies of post-modernism that ride<br/>roughshod over (or ignore) what has been discovered in hermeneutics.</p><p>JG: Hermeneutics? Can you (briefly) define?</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; About &quot;perfectly in tune&quot;. Would the agreement enabled by the<br/>&gt; perception of beats between harmonics of the fundamentals be<br/>&gt; as unanimous if there were no overtones to &quot;cue&quot; upon (as in<br/>&gt; the strictly sinusoidal case)?</p><p>DK:<br/>No.</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; Ears disagree nevertheless.<br/>&gt; Only those with &quot;good ears&quot; can appreciate the subtle beauty<br/>&gt; which is surely missed with those of &quot;tin ears&quot; (who proceed<br/>&gt; unawares of what they are &quot;missing&quot;).</p><p>DK:<br/>Yes. The thing is that &quot;good ears&quot; are defined by the fact that they<br/>are by far the largest group that all tend to agree with each other.<br/>The &quot;tin ears&quot; not only don&apos;t agree with the &quot;good ears&quot; but they<br/>don&apos;t agree with each other either.</p><p>JG: Would you then say that &quot;widespread agreement&quot; where it<br/>comes to impressions subjectively gathered constitutes a<br/>workable &quot;objectivity&quot; by virtue of a professed &quot;agreement&quot;,<br/>only, without regard for the (subjective) basis of those<br/>impressions? Or, put another way, is an &quot;agreed&quot; meaning<br/>of a &quot;definition&quot; sufficient evidence as to its &quot;objectivity&quot;?</p><p>DK:<br/>This is certainly not a foolproof way of defining things or deciding<br/>whether there is &quot;really something there&quot; in general, as our<br/>&quot;democratic&quot; systems of government should make clear. Although a major<br/>problem here is that is that there can probably never be any experts<br/>in &quot;making everybody happy at the same time&quot; and most people are so<br/>far from knowing anything at all about that (or even caring about it),<br/>that it isn&apos;t funny.</p><p>JG: But, is not an attempt at &quot;defintion&quot; (at least) an attempt<br/>to make &quot;everybody happy at the same time&quot;? Do we not (as &quot;object-<br/>ivists&quot;) ultimately judge the (objective) veracity of a &quot;definition&quot;<br/>by the extent to which that condition is approached, and tend to<br/>shun those (what we call &quot;subjective&quot;) &quot;definitions&quot; by the extent<br/>to which that condition is *not* approached? Is there not such a<br/>burden placed upon &quot;objective&quot; knowledge claims? We can empathize<br/>with the specialist who may attempt (in vain) to be an expert in<br/>&quot;making everybody happy at the same time&quot;, but is that not the<br/>nature of positing &quot;objective knowledge claims&quot; (to attempt to<br/>find a maximal percentage of the population to be in agreement)?</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; Therefore, the sense of<br/>&gt; &quot;objectivity&quot; (relating to &quot;perfect tuning&quot;) can only extend<br/>&gt; to those who report sensory acuity exceeding any &quot;democratic&quot;<br/>&gt; population &quot;averages&quot;.</p><p>DK:<br/>Not those who merely report, but those who form the largest-by-far<br/>community of people who agree with each other (if not on the fine<br/>details at least on the bulk of cases).</p><p>JG: Would you abandon your (personal) opinions if you found<br/>yourself outside of a community&apos;s populational majority of<br/>perception (if they could *not* hear what you can *clearly* hear)?</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; The &quot;definition&quot; can only be &quot;known&quot;<br/>&gt; by those who *already* &quot;understand&quot;. When I am gone, will you<br/>&gt; &quot;know&quot; what I &quot;would have meant&quot; by &quot;perfectly in tune&quot; when<br/>&gt; you &quot;hear it (for) yourself&quot;?</p><p>DK:<br/>Not precisely no. But it doesn&apos;t matter, because it doesn&apos;t depend on<br/>only you.</p><p>JG: But if and when - we are *all* gone, and others may choose<br/>different metaphors to identify their perceived &quot;characteristics&quot;<br/>of &quot;purity&quot; and &quot;just-ness&quot;, would not the &quot;veracity&quot; of our chosen<br/>definition (arrived at through inherently subjective processes)<br/>appear to have arisen out of *us* (and the metaphors of our<br/>linguistic communications), and not out of the physical events<br/>perceived by us?</p><p>&gt; JG: I agree that Nature is indifferent to simplicity,<br/>&gt; and that the &quot;knowledge&quot; we speak of is an &quot;indwelled<br/>&gt; knowledge&quot; accessible only via direct (aural) experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It does seem, though, that all &quot;recipes or injunctions&quot;<br/>&gt; must leave room for &quot;personal taste&quot;, and in doing so,<br/>&gt; one has no certainty as to the &quot;definition&quot; (of an<br/>&gt; experience) as it exists in the mind of &quot;another&quot;.</p><p>DK:<br/>Not total certainty, no. But a good enough degree of certainty<br/>nonetheless. Enough to let us &quot;just get on with it&quot;.</p><p>JG: Would you say the &quot;level of agreement&quot;, and the resulting<br/>&quot;senses of certainty&quot; which arise out of tuning list threads<br/>are a good example of just &quot;getting on with it&quot;? Who shall<br/>decide what is a &quot;good enough degree of certainty&quot;? Or, if<br/>such was determined by democratic vote, could those who can<br/>&quot;perceive what others cannot&quot; be said to be included in the<br/>dialog, or marginalized by statistical rules of &quot;good enough&quot;?</p><p>JG:<br/>&gt; How would one then ensure that such a &quot;definition&quot;<br/>&gt; would &quot;mean what one had intended it to mean (to others)&quot;?</p><p>DK:<br/>The more time we spend listening to harmonies together and dialoguing<br/>with another the more certain we will be.</p><p>JG: Seems like a reasonable empirical approach to the<br/>attempted comparison of individual human perceptions<br/>which are personally experienced by those individuals.</p><p>But even if all we had was an ancient book describing justness and<br/>there had been no continuity of shared experience. Provided the author<br/>was not genetically radically different (think of colour-blindness) it<br/>could still be communicated injunctively. We&apos;d soon find that &quot;there&apos;s<br/>really something there&quot;.</p><p>JG: This is an exciting prospect. I take it that since you say,<br/>&quot;We&apos;d soon find that &apos;theres really something there&apos;.&quot;, such has<br/>yet, in your viewpoint, to have occured (or do I misunderstand you)?</p><p>From your statements above, (my) impression is that:</p><p>(1) The determination of the &quot;just-ness&quot; (or &quot;purity&quot;) of a<br/>    given tone when combined with another tone (or other tones):</p><p>     (a) requires an listening time-window of sufficient length<br/>         to allow for the perception of &quot;beating effects&quot;; and</p><p>     (b) requires that the listener then &quot;listen for beats&quot;.</p><p>(2) The determination of &quot;perfectly in tune&quot; may be severely<br/>    limited in the case of combinations of sinusoidal tones,<br/>    due to &quot;the agreement enabled by the perception of beats<br/>    between *harmonics* of the fundamentals&quot; thanks in large<br/>    measure to the presence of &quot;overtones&quot; to &apos;cue&apos; upon.</p><p>(3) Similarly, the determination of the presence of &quot;beats&quot;<br/>    may be severely limited in the case of combinations of<br/>    sinusoidal tones, due to the perception of such &quot;beats&quot;<br/>   existing between *harmonics* of the fundamentals due<br/>    to the presence of &quot;overtones&quot; to &apos;cue&apos; upon.</p><p>Due to such determinations by a listener of &quot;just-ness&quot;<br/>arising out of special conditions (such as those that exist<br/>when we stop to tune our instruments), and the evident heavy<br/>reliance of the the combined tones in question being &quot;complex&quot;<br/>(with harmonics of the fundamental frequencies involved being<br/>introduced, either externally or &quot;internally&quot;), is it reasonable<br/>to posit that &quot;just-ness&quot; exists a valid descriptor in the<br/>situation of the combination of small numbers of sinusoidal<br/>tones which possess no harmonic energies?</p><p>Is it reasonable to posit that &quot;just-ness&quot; exists as a valid<br/>descriptor in the situation where tones (either sinusoidal<br/>or &quot;complex&quot;) are *not* present simultaneously for time-windows<br/>which are *not* &quot;longer than any sustained harmonies you intend<br/>to use in actual music&quot;?</p><p>Curiously,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=33573 href="#33573">ðŸ”—</a>unidala &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2002 7:33:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is it reasonable to posit that &quot;just-ness&quot; exists as a valid<br/>&gt; descriptor in the situation where tones (either sinusoidal<br/>&gt; or &quot;complex&quot;) are *not* present simultaneously for time-windows<br/>&gt; which are *not* &quot;longer than any sustained harmonies you intend<br/>&gt; to use in actual music&quot;?</p><p>Revised closing paragraph of ATL #33572 SHOULD READ:</p><p>Is it reasonable to posit that &quot;just-ness&quot; exists as a valid<br/>descriptor in the situation where tones (either sinusoidal<br/>or &quot;complex&quot;) are *not* present simultaneously for time-windows<br/>which are &quot;longer than any sustained harmonies you intend<br/>to use in actual music&quot;?</p><p>J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=33580 href="#33580">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2002 12:14:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_33572.html#33572">/tuning/topicId_33572.html#33572</a></p><p>Hi J.

What about the (entirely) &quot;harmonic&quot; case (where<br/>&gt;  &gt; *all* harmonics of each tone were present)?</p><p>I should have said earlier that, assuming they are intended to represent<br/>intervals (which I&apos;d write as 15:16 etc) these are allm undoubtedly<br/>&quot;JI_system&quot; ratios, which is apparently all that some people mean when they<br/>call them simply &quot;JI&quot;. They don&apos;t necessarily mean to imply that they can<br/>be tuned by ear. I think this usage is unfortunate.</p><p>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; The perceptual definition of just _must_ consider the context.<br/>&gt; What is just in one context may not be so in another. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Here I add DK&apos;s statements in ATL #15836:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; The important point is that whether or not an interval or chord<br/>&gt; is &apos;justly intoned&apos;, is not a mathematical property, it&apos;s about<br/>&gt; how something _sounds_! &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; It may be a &quot;JI tuning&quot; (although most are not) but that<br/>&gt; does not make all the intervals it contains &quot;JI intervals&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Here I add DK&apos;s statement in ATL #16006 relating to chords:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; I did mean as dyads or I would have said otherwise. But when they<br/>&gt; appear in chords, how could you tell if they were consonant, or<br/>merely<br/>&gt; dissonances in consonant chords? i.e. how can you apportion<br/>consonance<br/>&gt; among the components of a chord, except by listening to them<br/>&gt; separately? But I perceive an otonal chord as more consonant than<br/>the<br/>&gt; sum of its parts. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Followed by the statement:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; But one can certainly tell if a pitch is justly intoned in the<br/>context<br/>&gt; of a chord, by varying it slightly either way and listening<br/>&gt; for beats. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Yes. Thanks for reminding me of that.</p><p>&gt; JG: In regards to a possible concept of &quot;melodic consonance&quot;<br/>&gt; related to &quot;just-ness&quot;, DK stated in ATL #16006:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; I really don&apos;t think there is<br/>&gt; such a thing as melodic consonance. I _might_ be able to stretch the<br/>&gt; concept of justness to pure melody (in which case the claimed ratios<br/>&gt; need to be very simple and don&apos;t need any great accuracy), but<br/>melodic<br/>&gt; consonance? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is interesting that such a restriction of the scope<br/>&gt; of &quot;consonance&quot; (which makes some sense from a certain<br/>&gt; standpoint) seems to differentiate perceptions of<br/>&gt; &quot;just-ness&quot; from that of Terhardt&apos;s &quot;tonal affinity&quot;<br/>&gt; (said to be largely concerned with *consecutive* tones).</p><p>Ok.</p><p>&gt; JG: Dan Stearn&apos;s response to DK&apos;s ATL #15836 (in ATL #15841)<br/>&gt; appears to raise some interesting points, which speak to the<br/>&gt; scope of which the phrase &quot;just intonation&quot; as discussed may<br/>&gt; be realistically applied.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DS stated: &lt;&lt; all this assumes NO musical context or aesthetic/<br/>&gt; artistic intention whatsoever... &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DS&apos;s first point seems to relate to stylistic choice, and<br/>&gt; whether the presence of such choices should be considered<br/>&gt; to serve to either - qualify music as produced to<br/>&gt; (or to disqualify it from) - the status of &quot;just intonation&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; I mean if I play &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in octaves at the piano<br/>&gt; is it not justly intoned? Is it now &quot;just intonation&quot; music! &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DS&apos;s second point seems to relate to pitch uncertainty in time:<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; Or how about a piece or body of music composed in strict JI<br/>&gt; that zips along at a rapid enough clip as to render<br/>&gt; even sizable tuning errors all but a moot point...<br/>&gt; is this music any less JI than some long drawn-out, easy as pie<br/>&gt; musical demonstration of the same justly intoned intervals? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: DS&apos;s second point above raises an issue which upon<br/>&gt; consideration would seem to qualify the distinction of<br/>&gt; JI to the cases where our &quot;aural minds&quot; have the opportunity<br/>&gt; in time to *accurately discern* the relationships between<br/>&gt; combinations of tones which are determined by &quot;listening<br/>&gt; for beats&quot; (as DK stated in ATL #16006 quoted above). Thus,<br/>&gt; one&apos;s ability to make a determination of &quot;just-ness&quot; would<br/>&gt; appear to be limited by the listening context, requiring<br/>&gt; the opportunity to compare a small number of [assumed to<br/>&gt; be &quot;complex&quot; (with some/all harmonics present)] tones for<br/>&gt; a time period adequate for the resolution of a perception<br/>&gt; (however gathered) &quot;purity&quot; and/or &quot;perfectly in tune&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This would seem to restrict the application of such a<br/>&gt; definition of the term &quot;just&quot; to those special circumstances<br/>&gt; in which the listener is able to make such a (whether it be<br/>&gt; subjective, or persuasively objective) determination, and<br/>&gt; not necessarily to some examples of such scale-pitches<br/>&gt; when combined for short time intervals, where the perceptions<br/>&gt; resulting from such scale-pitches combined as &quot;drones&quot; may<br/>&gt; not apply in a dynamic musical context of short-duration notes.</p><p>Yes this is a grey area that I don&apos;t really want to get into. Emotions tend<br/>to run high.</p><p>&gt; JG: In relation to pitch-ratios containing large valued integers,<br/>&gt; DK stated in ATL #15836:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; 12544:9801 isn&apos;t any kind of JI interval. Not because it has<br/>large<br/>&gt; numbers in it, but because it isn&apos;t close enough to any ratio with<br/>small<br/>&gt; enough numbers. It might by accident be a consequence of some<br/>&gt; JI tuning, but there is no way it could be called a just interval.<br/>&gt; You only have to listen to it, and then try varying the pitch<br/>&gt; of one of the notes slightly in both directions to hear that<br/>&gt; there is nothing &quot;just&quot; about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; If an interval &quot;has a quality much like those of tempered<br/>(irrational)<br/>&gt; ratios surrounding it&quot;, this is precisely what<br/>&gt; defines it as not just! &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;MS: Possibly one might use capitalization to suggest a difference<br/>&gt;  &gt;in nuance between a &quot;just&quot; interval (any integer ratio) and a Just<br/>&gt;  &gt;interval (an interval with a _small_ integer ratio readily<br/>tuneable<br/>&gt;  &gt;by ear by a locking in of partials).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; No. This would be a complete departure from history. Motivated<br/>&gt; apparently by mathematics (or numerology) rather than<br/>&gt; art or aesthetics.<br/>&gt; just = Just = pure = tuneable by ear  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK(continued):<br/>&gt; If we are asking whether<br/>&gt; a particular scale is just, I suggest we accept an interval as just<br/>if<br/>&gt; it can be tuned by listening for slow beats in any context that can<br/>be<br/>&gt; provided by the rest of the scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: By &quot;any context&quot;, do you mean (in the most general sense)<br/>&gt; &quot;all possible combinations of the *complex* tones of a given<br/>&gt; scale with all of the other *complex* tones of that same scale&quot;?</p><p>Yes. And if you need to use some unusual timbre to do so, then you should<br/>say so.</p><p>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; Then if the scale&apos;s<br/>&gt; just-interval-graph is connected, (where vertices are the pitches<br/>and<br/>&gt; edges are the just intervals), I&apos;d call the scale just.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Sounds interesting! Do you have graphic examples of<br/>&gt; the &quot;just-interval-graph&quot; of any particular scales?</p><p>These are just the lattices we normally use, but when you go past the<br/>9-limit you need to look at whether some of the edges need to be deleted<br/>because the necessary otonal context isn&apos;t available.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; JG: When I choose colors in PaintShop Pro, I use what I like,<br/>&gt;  &gt; as well as what translates in ways that I like to a printed page.<br/>&gt;  &gt; I do not think about &quot;purity&quot; (though there may be those<br/>&gt;  &gt; who do). It seems highly subjective to me ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; It may be simply that no one has ever pointed out to you what pure<br/>&gt; colours are. As in &quot;Look at this colour chart. Here are some<br/>examples<br/>&gt; of pure colours. Now these other ones are colours of the same hue<br/>but<br/>&gt; different degrees of purity (or saturation). This one is really<br/>close<br/>&gt; to pure. So now do you get what we mean by &quot;pure&quot;? Do you think this<br/>&gt; one is pure?&quot; And so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can do the same thing to teach people what we mean by &quot;just&quot;<br/>&gt; for harmony. Maybe twanging a few guitar strings simultaneously and<br/>&gt; varing the pitch of one string while saying stuff like &quot;Hear how<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a sort of beating effect that slows down and then speeds up<br/>&gt; again. When it&apos;s so slow that you can only tell its there by<br/>listening<br/>&gt; for longer than any sustained harmonies you intend to use in actual<br/>&gt; music, then that&apos;s called &quot;just&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: So, it appears that you consider that a listening time-<br/>&gt; window &quot;longer than any sustained harmonies you intend to use<br/>&gt; in actual music&quot; which is (in the least) a long enough time<br/>&gt; period within which a listener can perceive whatever<br/>&gt; &quot;beating effects&quot; between the tones in question are present<br/>&gt; are essential conditions for the &quot;aural mind&apos;s&quot; determination<br/>&gt; of &quot;just-ness&quot; to take place?</p><p>Well yes, but I&apos;m not insisting that the actual music played, have these<br/>long sustains. It&apos;s just the way to prove that a scale or chord or interval<br/>is just.</p><p>&gt; JG:<br/>&gt;  &gt; But I am more interested in what *you* consider as &quot;pure&quot;<br/>&gt;  &gt; *sound*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; Now wait a minute. I&apos;m concerned that you think there is some value<br/>&gt; judgment (good/bad) involved in the use of the word &quot;pure&quot; here.<br/>There<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t. In both colour and harmony (note: not merely sound) the word<br/>&gt; &quot;pure&quot; has a technical meaning that has very little to do with the<br/>&gt; word&apos;s common usage. Same for &quot;just&quot;. In this context &quot;pure&quot; is<br/>simply<br/>&gt; a synonym for &quot;just&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: But you state (also quoted below within your text):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; Yes it would be different (simpler) if we were painters. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; We are far from that in modelling perception of harmony. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG:<br/>&gt;  &gt; Therefore (even with interesting numbers), the nature of the<br/>&gt;  &gt; (subject-ive) subject of perception seems to preclude us from<br/>&gt;  &gt; declaring a democratic (statistical) or physical evidentiary<br/>&gt;  &gt; (speculative conceptual) objective &quot;knowledge claim&quot; in the<br/>&gt;  &gt; matter. Would it be different (or simpler) if we were painters?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes it would be different (simpler) if we were painters.<br/>Mathematical<br/>&gt; modelling of colour perception is essentially complete and we have<br/>&gt; internationally accepted standards based on it. We can now give<br/>&gt; precise mathematical specifications of what we mean by particular<br/>&gt; colours. Obviously we had to rely on the consensus (or statistical<br/>&gt; combination of opinions) of experts to give names to particular<br/>&gt; regions of mathematically-modelled colour space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We are far from that in modelling perception of harmony. The time<br/>&gt; dimension seems to make it difficult for one thing. The problem is<br/>&gt; that people are trying to give a mathematical definition of &quot;just&quot;,<br/>&gt; way too early in the piece and failing to recognise the<br/>&gt; contradictions they create.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where do people get this idea that merely because something is<br/>&gt; subjective one has to accept that anyone&apos;s version of the concept is<br/>&gt; as good as anyone elses. This is nonsense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Perhaps from the inherent paradox of - where our sensory<br/>&gt; perceptions are concerned, the &quot;data&quot; gathered, from &quot;square-<br/>&gt; one&quot;, seems impossible to differentiate from the elements that<br/>&gt; our own (subjective) &quot;massaging&quot; and &quot;noise&quot; interject into<br/>&gt; the reported &quot;values&quot; of such &quot;data&quot;, for whatever reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Therefore, it seems as troublesome to speak of &quot;objectivity&quot;<br/>&gt; arrived at by an ongoing &quot;concensus&quot; derived from communications<br/>&gt; describing sensory impressions (subjectively) arrived at, where<br/>&gt; such a conception of &quot;objectivity&quot; must (inherently) be arrived<br/>&gt; at based upon a communicated &quot;agreement&quot; of inherently (subjective)<br/>&gt; experiences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could we also endeavor to agree on satisfying definitions of<br/>&gt; &quot;what it means&quot; to perceive the quality of a sound(s) as being<br/>&gt; &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;fuzzy&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, &quot;big&quot;, &quot;bouncy&quot;, &quot;fat&quot;, &quot;rich&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;?</p><p>Quite possibly, but I&apos;m not about to try. :-)</p><p>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; Actually I think it derives<br/>&gt; from some of the popular fallacies of post-modernism that ride<br/>&gt; roughshod over (or ignore) what has been discovered in hermeneutics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Hermeneutics? Can you (briefly) define?</p><p>The study of how we interpret texts. Or how indeed we manage to communicate<br/>at all. Hermes was the mesenger of the gods. It is sometimes taken to be<br/>particularly concerned with interpreting _ancient_ texts, but has become<br/>more general. I understand it is concerned with the entire culture or<br/>community of people who the text was written by or for.</p><p>&gt; JG:<br/>&gt;  &gt; About &quot;perfectly in tune&quot;. Would the agreement enabled by the<br/>&gt;  &gt; perception of beats between harmonics of the fundamentals be<br/>&gt;  &gt; as unanimous if there were no overtones to &quot;cue&quot; upon (as in<br/>&gt;  &gt; the strictly sinusoidal case)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; No.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG:<br/>&gt;  &gt; Ears disagree nevertheless.<br/>&gt;  &gt; Only those with &quot;good ears&quot; can appreciate the subtle beauty<br/>&gt;  &gt; which is surely missed with those of &quot;tin ears&quot; (who proceed<br/>&gt;  &gt; unawares of what they are &quot;missing&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; Yes. The thing is that &quot;good ears&quot; are defined by the fact that they<br/>&gt; are by far the largest group that all tend to agree with each other.<br/>&gt; The &quot;tin ears&quot; not only don&apos;t agree with the &quot;good ears&quot; but they<br/>&gt; don&apos;t agree with each other either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Would you then say that &quot;widespread agreement&quot; where it<br/>&gt; comes to impressions subjectively gathered constitutes a<br/>&gt; workable &quot;objectivity&quot; by virtue of a professed &quot;agreement&quot;,<br/>&gt; only, without regard for the (subjective) basis of those<br/>&gt; impressions? Or, put another way, is an &quot;agreed&quot; meaning<br/>&gt; of a &quot;definition&quot; sufficient evidence as to its &quot;objectivity&quot;?</p><p>Subjective/Objective is a false dichotomy. There&apos;s a lot of stuff that is<br/>both or neither but requires a _community_ of communicators. It&apos;s not<br/>personal or impersonal it&apos;s transpersonal, and we couldn&apos;t get by without it.</p><p>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; This is certainly not a foolproof way of defining things or deciding<br/>&gt; whether there is &quot;really something there&quot; in general, as our<br/>&gt; &quot;democratic&quot; systems of government should make clear. Although a<br/>major<br/>&gt; problem here is that is that there can probably never be any experts<br/>&gt; in &quot;making everybody happy at the same time&quot; and most people are so<br/>&gt; far from knowing anything at all about that (or even caring about<br/>it),<br/>&gt; that it isn&apos;t funny.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: But, is not an attempt at &quot;defintion&quot; (at least) an attempt<br/>&gt; to make &quot;everybody happy at the same time&quot;? Do we not (as &quot;object-<br/>&gt; ivists&quot;) ultimately judge the (objective) veracity of a &quot;definition&quot;<br/>&gt; by the extent to which that condition is approached, and tend to<br/>&gt; shun those (what we call &quot;subjective&quot;) &quot;definitions&quot; by the extent<br/>&gt; to which that condition is *not* approached? Is there not such a<br/>&gt; burden placed upon &quot;objective&quot; knowledge claims? We can empathize<br/>&gt; with the specialist who may attempt (in vain) to be an expert in<br/>&gt; &quot;making everybody happy at the same time&quot;, but is that not the<br/>&gt; nature of positing &quot;objective knowledge claims&quot; (to attempt to<br/>&gt; find a maximal percentage of the population to be in agreement)?</p><p>Good point.</p><p>&gt; JG:<br/>&gt;  &gt; Therefore, the sense of<br/>&gt;  &gt; &quot;objectivity&quot; (relating to &quot;perfect tuning&quot;) can only extend<br/>&gt;  &gt; to those who report sensory acuity exceeding any &quot;democratic&quot;<br/>&gt;  &gt; population &quot;averages&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; Not those who merely report, but those who form the largest-by-far<br/>&gt; community of people who agree with each other (if not on the fine<br/>&gt; details at least on the bulk of cases).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Would you abandon your (personal) opinions if you found<br/>&gt; yourself outside of a community&apos;s populational majority of<br/>&gt; perception (if they could *not* hear what you can *clearly* hear)?</p><p>That&apos;s an interesting one. Clearly colour-blind people do this routinely.<br/>They accept that other people can distinguish things that they cannot. They<br/>accept that they are &quot;wrong&quot;. Pidgeons have convinced us that they can<br/>distinguish colours that we cannot, but possibly only because we have<br/>instruments (spectrometers) that even outdo the pidgeons.</p><p>&gt; JG:<br/>&gt;  &gt; The &quot;definition&quot; can only be &quot;known&quot;<br/>&gt;  &gt; by those who *already* &quot;understand&quot;. When I am gone, will you<br/>&gt;  &gt; &quot;know&quot; what I &quot;would have meant&quot; by &quot;perfectly in tune&quot; when<br/>&gt;  &gt; you &quot;hear it (for) yourself&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; Not precisely no. But it doesn&apos;t matter, because it doesn&apos;t depend<br/>on<br/>&gt; only you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: But if and when - we are *all* gone, and others may choose<br/>&gt; different metaphors to identify their perceived &quot;characteristics&quot;<br/>&gt; of &quot;purity&quot; and &quot;just-ness&quot;, would not the &quot;veracity&quot; of our chosen<br/>&gt; definition (arrived at through inherently subjective processes)<br/>&gt; appear to have arisen out of *us* (and the metaphors of our<br/>&gt; linguistic communications), and not out of the physical events<br/>&gt; perceived by us?</p><p>Yes. Certainly. The chosen _metaphors_ may be different but it still seems<br/>likely that the same ear-brain systems would still draw the same<br/>distinctions, whatever they are called, whether anyone ever notices them<br/>and points them out to others is another question.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; JG: I agree that Nature is indifferent to simplicity,<br/>&gt;  &gt; and that the &quot;knowledge&quot; we speak of is an &quot;indwelled<br/>&gt;  &gt; knowledge&quot; accessible only via direct (aural) experience.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; It does seem, though, that all &quot;recipes or injunctions&quot;<br/>&gt;  &gt; must leave room for &quot;personal taste&quot;, and in doing so,<br/>&gt;  &gt; one has no certainty as to the &quot;definition&quot; (of an<br/>&gt;  &gt; experience) as it exists in the mind of &quot;another&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; Not total certainty, no. But a good enough degree of certainty<br/>&gt; nonetheless. Enough to let us &quot;just get on with it&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Would you say the &quot;level of agreement&quot;, and the resulting<br/>&gt; &quot;senses of certainty&quot; which arise out of tuning list threads<br/>&gt; are a good example of just &quot;getting on with it&quot;? Who shall<br/>&gt; decide what is a &quot;good enough degree of certainty&quot;? Or, if<br/>&gt; such was determined by democratic vote, could those who can<br/>&gt; &quot;perceive what others cannot&quot; be said to be included in the<br/>&gt; dialog, or marginalized by statistical rules of &quot;good enough&quot;?</p><p>A single individual may be able to prove that they can distinguish what the<br/>majority cannot. We&apos;d still have to make a &quot;just getting on with it&quot; kind<br/>of decision about whether to incorporate the abilities of such a minority.<br/>Democratic votes should be a last resort. We should aim for 100% agreement<br/>and eventually people just get tired and say &quot;good enough&quot;. This is<br/>&quot;consensus&quot;.</p><p>&gt; JG:<br/>&gt;  &gt; How would one then ensure that such a &quot;definition&quot;<br/>&gt;  &gt; would &quot;mean what one had intended it to mean (to others)&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DK:<br/>&gt; The more time we spend listening to harmonies together and<br/>dialoguing<br/>&gt; with another the more certain we will be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Seems like a reasonable empirical approach to the<br/>&gt; attempted comparison of individual human perceptions<br/>&gt; which are personally experienced by those individuals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But even if all we had was an ancient book describing justness and<br/>&gt; there had been no continuity of shared experience. Provided the<br/>author<br/>&gt; was not genetically radically different (think of colour-blindness)<br/>it<br/>&gt; could still be communicated injunctively. We&apos;d soon find that<br/>&quot;there&apos;s<br/>&gt; really something there&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: This is an exciting prospect. I take it that since you say,<br/>&gt; &quot;We&apos;d soon find that &apos;theres really something there&apos;.&quot;, such has<br/>&gt; yet, in your viewpoint, to have occured (or do I misunderstand you)?</p><p>It has probably happened many times.</p><p>&gt;  From your statements above, (my) impression is that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) The determination of the &quot;just-ness&quot; (or &quot;purity&quot;) of a<br/>&gt;      given tone when combined with another tone (or other tones):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (a) requires an listening time-window of sufficient length<br/>&gt;           to allow for the perception of &quot;beating effects&quot;; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       (b) requires that the listener then &quot;listen for beats&quot;.</p><p>Yes. But now of course we have to explain what &quot;beats&quot; are, but at least<br/>this seems an easier task.</p><p>&gt; (2) The determination of &quot;perfectly in tune&quot; may be severely<br/>&gt;      limited in the case of combinations of sinusoidal tones,<br/>&gt;      due to &quot;the agreement enabled by the perception of beats<br/>&gt;      between *harmonics* of the fundamentals&quot; thanks in large<br/>&gt;      measure to the presence of &quot;overtones&quot; to &apos;cue&apos; upon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) Similarly, the determination of the presence of &quot;beats&quot;<br/>&gt;      may be severely limited in the case of combinations of<br/>&gt;      sinusoidal tones, due to the perception of such &quot;beats&quot;<br/>&gt;     existing between *harmonics* of the fundamentals due<br/>&gt;      to the presence of &quot;overtones&quot; to &apos;cue&apos; upon.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; Due to such determinations by a listener of &quot;just-ness&quot;<br/>&gt; arising out of special conditions (such as those that exist<br/>&gt; when we stop to tune our instruments), and the evident heavy<br/>&gt; reliance of the the combined tones in question being &quot;complex&quot;<br/>&gt; (with harmonics of the fundamental frequencies involved being<br/>&gt; introduced, either externally or &quot;internally&quot;), is it reasonable<br/>&gt; to posit that &quot;just-ness&quot; exists a valid descriptor in the<br/>&gt; situation of the combination of small numbers of sinusoidal<br/>&gt; tones which possess no harmonic energies?</p><p>I guess so.</p><p>&gt; Is it reasonable to posit that &quot;just-ness&quot; exists as a valid<br/>&gt; descriptor in the situation where tones (either sinusoidal<br/>&gt; or &quot;complex&quot;) are *not* present simultaneously for time-windows<br/>&gt; which are *not* &quot;longer than any sustained harmonies you intend<br/>&gt; to use in actual music&quot;?</p><p>Too many &quot;not&quot;s there with no parentheses.

Where is the global outcry, the unprecedented<br/>coalition, the unlimited resources of money, materials, time and will<br/>dedicated to stopping this daily violence? These children are being<br/>killed by commercial and financial terrorism. There can be no other term<br/>for policies which force the poor to sacrifice their children to pay<br/>compound interest on dubious debts to the rich, while the North refuses<br/>to honour its historical and ecological debts to the South.<br/>Jakob von Uexkull</p></div>
