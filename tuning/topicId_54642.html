Why would anyone want to use a material in a different<br/>way than it was originally meant for?&quot; I just like the sound that comes out,<br/>I love it. Moreover, such a scale can be tuned quite well with no other<br/>&quot;tuning devices&quot; than your own ears. There is no meantone with at least one<br/>beatless major or minor triad. And what&apos;s bad about solving this with a<br/>quasi-meantone tuning? And to prove the point, the one particular scale I&apos;ve<br/>sent even contains a 7-limit tetrad which is played as Bb-D-F-G#.

And, along with your further commentary, I can only<br/>&gt; offer my views: I am happy with any path that a person chooses. The<br/>&gt; only time I happen to bring up the topic of &quot;creating new music that<br/>&gt; is old music in new tunings&quot; around here is in relation to the<br/>&gt; furtherance of new intonational resources. In this regard, I happen to<br/>&gt; think it is a less fruitful path than music that is truly new;</p><p>Even though I&apos;m basically in agreement, I just feel compelled to offer the<br/>reminder here that nothing is &quot;truly new&quot;, and that if it was it would<br/>probably be unrecognizable, not very meaningful.</p><p>We are always in dialog with the past.  And I think this is why we create.<br/>The present that is coming out of us (the new, the future) is in response to<br/>the present that went into us (the old, the past).  It is what we receive<br/>that we respond to.  This creates a relationship, a dialog.  This happens in<br/>time, over time, because of time, thanks to time.</p><p>What better thing for the future to be a *response* to (as opposed to a<br/>*repeat* of), than the past?  And so as we are in dialog, asking questions,<br/>some of those questions take the form of little &quot;experiments&quot; (e.g. old<br/>music in new tunings) and others take the form of &quot;compositions&quot;.  If were<br/>were anything more than .01% conscious of exactly how were were moved to<br/>create a &quot;new&quot; piece of music then we would be in a position to compare and<br/>contrast &quot;experiments&quot; with &quot;compositions&quot;, but I think we are not in fact<br/>*very* conscious.  We know what we are conscious of, but we hardly know the<br/>vastness of what we are not conscious of, and it is the latter that accounts<br/>for most of what we produce, I would say.  And so what is really &quot;new&quot;?  New<br/>might be defined as something whose relationship to the old is something we<br/>are not conscious of!</p><p>So I&apos;d be curious then, in light of this, how would you describe what you<br/>are most interested in?  I wonder if it is actually similar to me:  I&apos;m<br/>interested in what is in some sense a new approach to relating to what is<br/>here (which is what is left by what has passed).  The sense that newness<br/>relates to something &quot;unconscious&quot; is interesting because this also means it<br/>involves something previously unknown to consciousness, so the emphasis can<br/>be shifted from &quot;the unconscious&quot; to &quot;the unknown&quot;.  Engagement with the<br/>unknown is of course the way for new things to become known.  The curious<br/>thing is still how much of what was unknown has actually existed for a long<br/>time.  This is true of unconscious motives that we become conscious of.<br/>Likewise it may be true of the unfolding of musical understanding.  In some<br/>sense the unfolding succession of newer things also touches on progressively<br/>more ancient things.  So perhaps the &quot;end&quot; of what we do is to reach back to<br/>the &quot;beginning&quot; of things, ever closer.  We want to know our nature.</p><p>&gt; however, there are stalwart defenders of this other way of exploring<br/>&gt; tuning, and I simply wish them well.</p><p>Yes, and I do a bit of that &quot;other way&quot; myself.  Just because I am really<br/>moved to, because the questions that come from inside me (for unknown<br/>reasons) take that form.  So we each have our interests, and our responses<br/>are best in respone to those given interests.

It can<br/>also be that you are *moved* to have impact, and there is nothing wrong with<br/>that either.

You might find justification for your<br/>actions in your histories, but this also is just a distraction.</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt; Bach probably just thought he was a master craftsman of<br/>&gt; music; Haydn found he could please himself by also pleasing the<br/>&gt; Esterhazys, and Mozart was always on the lookout for a big hit. Then<br/>&gt; Beethoven came along and people (starting with Schubert!) began to be<br/>&gt; worried about being a Great Original Genius in the cosmic mold of<br/>&gt; Beethoven--the Romantic conception of the lone genius. This worked<br/>&gt; fine, though you will note the final talley of opus numbers is<br/>&gt; dropping, and the number of compositions people withdraw is rising.<br/>&gt; But I think it starts to be a problem later on, when people wanted to<br/>&gt; prove how daring and original they were by composing like Schoenberg<br/>&gt; or Webern, only not as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Music, really, was in a better state of health in the 18th century<br/>&gt; when composers did not have these notions knocking around in their<br/>&gt; bean, and had to please weathly patrons or mass audiences rather than<br/>&gt; prize or grant committes, or their academic collegues.</p></div><h3><a id=54740 href="#54740">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2004 11:03:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To this I would also say:  what do you think these people were going<br/>&gt; through?
