Thanks.  I haven&apos;t had any problem finding charts (all different) with frequencies for quarter comma meantone, but I don&apos;t know whether any of these charts are based on what some expert composers or keyboard tuners might have used several hundred years ago.  I know that everyone back then used different starting frequencies and had different tuning systems, believing his was the &quot;best&quot; way.  (Somehow that sounds like what we have been hearing on this tuning@egroups when talking about just intonation.  &quot;His own way&quot; is &quot;better than&quot; some other person&apos;s way!!!)

ALITA</p><p>Hi Alita -- No one used Hertz hundreds of years ago. Each region had its own pitch<br/>standard, so yes, there would have been a host of different starting frequencies, but 1/4-<br/>comma meantone is 1/4-comma meantone -- totally unambiguous (as long as you&apos;re<br/>sure to distinguish G# from Ab, etc.). If you&apos;re really concerned about reproducing the<br/>actual pitch level a particular composer or performer might have used, you might find<br/>some helpful clues in Ellis&apos;s appendix to Helmholtz&apos;s book, _On the Sensations of Tone_.</p></div>
