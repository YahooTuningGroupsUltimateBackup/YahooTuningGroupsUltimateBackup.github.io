But when you start changing the root of a chord from &quot;middle C&quot; I<br/>assume you have to keep very skillful track of which keys you use since 6,9,11,<br/>and 14 all have very different interval spacing (that is, if you want to keep<br/>using pure intervals in your chords).<br/>------------------</p><p>&gt;&quot;For another example, take a generator very close to Alpha, namely,<br/>&gt;(8/3)^(1/22).

I&apos;m not saying one is superior to the other (in fact, I&apos;m not terribly interested in either, though that Secor tuning looks promising), but there are certain advantages to both sides.  Yes, using the MOS of those temperaments allows you to maintain a low number of pitches and many of the useful properties of the non-octave scales, and are worth mentioning to people looking at the non-octave scales.  The only reason that I can see that the non-octave scales are more popular is, well, because they were proposed by Wendy Carlos, and she&apos;s pretty gosh-darn popular.

You are correct that they receive very little press, especially compared to the Carlos tunings.  We all have our pet tunings, I guess.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You know, when I think &quot;no fives&quot; I immediately think of 36, and &quot;no sevens&quot; brings 24 to mind, but I had to think a while before &quot;no threes&quot; brought up 31--because of course it does have a 3, just not so good as the 5 and the 7. 6 is another obvious number, and when I stuck 6 and 31 together I came up with something I didn&apos;t know--six supports hemiwuerschmidt temperament. This has a complex 3 anyway, so deep-sixing it is not so big a loss. The no-threes comma being tempered out is 3136/3125, which is a pretty important one, I&apos;m thinking, in the no-threes universe. For less complexity, there&apos;s 50/49, which you could use for a no-threes version of pajara.</p><p>If you tune the no-threes version of hemiwuerschmidt, you get very good tuning accuracy, nearly to the microtemperament range, coupled with low complexity. I&apos;ll think about it some more and see if I can figure out how to sell it. Good press seems to be important. The 6-note MOS and the very low error are a place to start, I suppose.</p></div><h3><a id=90802 href="#90802">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2010 7:17:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Huh?
