The official new address on Facebook for<br/>the Xenharmonic Alliance is here:</p><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/">http://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/</a></p><p>If the old group gets fixed in a reasonable amount of time, we&apos;ll<br/>re-abandon this group and move back. However, since it&apos;s now been<br/>almost a month and the problem is STILL around in the old group, I<br/>think it&apos;s likely we&apos;re going to just permanently relocate to the new<br/>one, with the old one serving as an archive.</p><p>For those who were active on the old Facebook XA group and still wish<br/>to participate, please update your bookmarks accordingly. Also, please<br/>note that the other Facebook &quot;experiments&quot; we were doing, like setting<br/>up an XA Facebook &quot;Page&quot; to take the place of the old &quot;Group,&quot; are now<br/>defunct. This has proven to be the easiest way to set things up going<br/>forward.</p><p>Again, that number is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/">http://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/</a>.<br/>It&apos;s a guaranteed good time, or you get your money back.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
