Below<br/>is my humble offering.</p><p>First, by way of introduction, let&apos;s take a look at the basic<br/>concepts of the Schumann Resonances from a couple of different<br/>websites:</p><p><a href="http://www.oulu.fi/~spaceweb/textbook/schumann.html">http://www.oulu.fi/~spaceweb/textbook/schumann.html</a></p><p>&quot;Between the nearly perfectly conducting terrestrial surface and<br/>ionosphere, a resonating cavity is formed. Broadband electromagnetic<br/>impulses, like those from lightning flashes, fill this cavity, and<br/>create globally the so-called Schumann resonances at frequencies 5 -<br/>50 Hz (Schumann, 1952; Bliokh et al., 1980; Sentman, 1987). The<br/>nominal average frequencies observed are 7.8, 14, 20, 26, 33, 39, and<br/>45 Hz with slight diurnal variation.&quot;</p><p>And from:</p><p><a href="http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/Schumann.html">http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/Schumann.html</a></p><p>&quot;If you look at the interior of the Earth, you see that there is a<br/>differential physical rotation of the solid inner core with respect<br/>to the surface of the Earth.  However, it takes about 400 years for<br/>the inner core to make a complete revolution inside the Earth, so<br/>that its frequency is only one cycle per 400 years.</p><p>It is more interesting to look at the frequency of currents at the<br/>boundary between the solid inner core and the liquid outer core.<br/>Since the inner core has radius of about 1,200 kilometers, its<br/>circumference is about 7,500 kilometers.</p><p>How long would it take an electrical current, traveling at the speed<br/>of light (300,000 km/sec), to go once around the circumference of the<br/>inner core (7,500 km)?</p><p>That is about 7,500 km  /  300,000 km/sec,  or  1/40 sec.</p><p>In other words, the natural frequency of the Earth at the boundary of<br/>the inner core is about 40 cycles/sec, which is at the upper end of<br/>the range of frequencies measured for the  Schumann resonances:<br/>7.8, 14, 20, 26, 33, 39 and 45 Hertz.</p><p>Therefore, the Schumann resonance frequencies correspond to the range<br/>of natural frequencies of the Earth<br/>from its surface to the boundary of its solid inner core.&quot;</p><p>Earth Tones,<br/>The Schumann Resonance Tuning:</p><p>If we wish to create a tuning which will allow us to harmonize with<br/>the frequencies of the Earth, we can take the nominal average<br/>frequencies of the Schumann Resonance spectrum, and turn them into a<br/>scale by converting the frequency ratios into cents, thusly:</p><p>Hz         Ratios          Cents          Consecutive<br/>7.8<br/>14         1.7949         1012.657<br/>20         1.4286         617.488         395.169<br/>26         1.3000         454.214         163.274<br/>33         1.2692         412.745         41.469<br/>39         1.1818         289.210         123.536<br/>45         1.1538         247.741         41.469</p><p>It is interesting to notice here the occurrence of two intervals at<br/>41.469 cents, lying between the 4th and 5th, and 6th and 7th<br/>harmonics of the spectra.</p><p>After sorting we can see that the approximated ratios are:</p><p>Ratio         Cents<br/>15/13         247.741<br/>13/11         289.210<br/>33/26         412.745<br/>13/10         454.214<br/>10/7          617.488<br/>70/39         1012.657</p><p>One can easily see the exciting fact, that the &quot;Chord of the Earth&quot;<br/>is of the 13 Prime Limit. It is remarkable how closely the averaged<br/>nominal frequencies of the Schumann Resonance spectrum are<br/>approximated by the 13 limit.</p><p>Using the Spectral Tempering technique I have basically outlined in a<br/>past post, we will fill in the scale gaps to achieve the needed<br/>chromatic semitones, giving us the below scale with 2 step sizes.<br/>Please note that I have extended the scale to the approximate octave:</p><p>Schumann Resonance Tuning</p><p>Degree         Cents                Consecutive<br/>0              0<br/>3              61.9353              61.9353<br/>5              103.2254             41.2902<br/>8              165.1607             61.9353<br/>10             206.4509             41.2902<br/>12             247.7411             41.2902<br/>14             289.0312             41.2902<br/>17             350.9665             61.9353<br/>20             412.9018             61.9353<br/>22             454.1919             41.2902<br/>25             516.1272             61.9353<br/>27             557.4174             41.2902<br/>30             619.3526             61.9353<br/>32             660.6428             41.2902<br/>34             701.9330             41.2902<br/>37             763.8682             61.9353<br/>39             805.1584             41.2902<br/>42             867.0937             61.9353<br/>45             929.0289             61.9353<br/>47             970.3191             41.2902<br/>49             1011.6093            41.2902<br/>52             1073.5446            61.9353<br/>54             1114.8347            41.2902<br/>57             1176.7700            61.9353<br/>59             1218.0602            41.2902</p><p>Since this scale is made up of 2 sizes of small semitones,<br/>let&apos;s &quot;ventilate&quot; the above scale, where we will derive a mode with<br/>fewer chromatic steps, which will leave the primary pitches of the<br/>Schumann Resonance spectrum in place, as follows:</p><p>Schumann Resonance, 14 Tone Mode<br/>Degree         Cents                Consecutive<br/>0              0<br/>3              61.9353              61.9353<br/>8              165.1607             103.2254<br/>12             247.7411             82.5804<br/>14             289.0312             41.2902<br/>20             412.9018             123.8705<br/>22             454.1919             41.2902<br/>25             516.1272             61.9353<br/>30             619.3526             103.2254<br/>34             701.9330             82.5804<br/>39             805.1584             103.2254<br/>45             929.0289             123.8705<br/>49             1011.6093            82.5804<br/>54             1114.8347            103.2254<br/>59             1218.0601            103.2254</p><p>One final point, is that if we wish to make our tuning be in harmony<br/>with the frequencies of the Earth, then we must make our tuning be in<br/>a multiple of the 7.8 Hz frequency which we have treated here as our<br/>1/1 ratio. Interestingly, we find that by doubling this value and<br/>raising it by octaves into the audible range of human hearing, that<br/>low and behold, the Earth is tuned to the key of &quot;B&quot;!

Yeah, sure, you can approximate anything with any prime limit to<br/>arbitrary precision.  But what might be remarkable is that the nearest Hz values go as high as 45<br/>and yet are all divisible by primes no larger than 13 - except for 7.8, which is 39/5, the<br/>numerator of which in turn is 13*3 (and one of the resonances).  It seems a little odd that the<br/>series just happens to miss 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 34, 38, 41, and 43 on its way to 45 in seven<br/>steps.  Somebody was watching where he stepped - might have been the guy doing the rounding, I<br/>don&apos;t know.  But design or postulation, a series like that isn&apos;t likely to occur on a roll of the<br/>dice.</p><p>Of course, the earth and many terrestrial objects oscillate at hundreds or thousands of different<br/>frequencies, not only the Schumann Resonances.

Your<br/>&quot;Cents&quot; column is already a list of the intervals between the resonances.  For example, the<br/>distance between 20 Hz and 26 Hz is 454c; the distance between 26 Hz and 33 Hz is 413c.  Why does<br/>it matter that the difference between these two intervals is 41c?  As a result of using this<br/>consecutive-of-consecutive basis, your scales don&apos;t contain the same relationships as the Schumann<br/>Resonances themselves.</p><p>If you want to play this particular &quot;chord of the earth&quot; in a musically useful range, why not<br/>simply transpose it up 3 octaves?  Or octave reduce it for a 7-tone octave repeating scale?</p><p>Cents  Note  Consecutive<br/>   0    B<br/> 289    C#    289<br/> 333    D      44<br/> 537    E     204<br/> 787    F##   250<br/> 916    G#    128<br/>1103    A#    187</p><p>Or keep piling these intervals on each other for chromatic versions?  At least then you&apos;d be able<br/>to play the Schumann chord, albeit in a higher register.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Raising it another octave we see A#, Bb @<br/>58.2704 Hz and B @ 61.7354 Hz.</p><p>So I think it is conceivable that the Bb is possible - it is indeed<br/>very close, but our modern pitch reference and relative note naming<br/>could be quite different, as the standards have evolved over the<br/>centuries.</p><p>As I was researching this, I actually wondered if this was known my<br/>the ancient Indian Masters, as they were so attuned to the Earth.</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
