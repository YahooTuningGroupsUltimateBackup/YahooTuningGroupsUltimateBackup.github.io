Neat! However, I wonder why none of the fine ears on this<br/>list have not yet commented on the tuning at the lower end of this<br/>keyboard. Could it be my board?</p><p>At higher volumes on my machine, at least, the pitch is somewhere in<br/>the vicinity of 60 or 70 cents sharp and as it fades, drops at the<br/>last minute to somewhere near the proper pitch. At low volume, the<br/>problem almost disappears, but there is still a slight vestige of it.<br/>Could this be due to pitch bending versus volume in the midi file<br/>behaving anomolously in my particular board, or is this more<br/>universal?</p><p>My sound board does fine for other microtonal midi and on MP3 files,<br/>so I&apos;m wondering what the problem is. For a microtonal keyboard, I<br/>find such tuning anomalies render it pretty much useless for the<br/>instructional purpose for which I assume it is intended.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Paul Hirsh &lt;monxmood@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2001 2:17:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi, Paul.
