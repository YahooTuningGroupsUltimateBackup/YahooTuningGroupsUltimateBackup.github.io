At<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; beginning of the progression I had to deduced two additional<br/>commas<br/>&gt; &gt; J and U whose values are:<br/>&gt; &gt; J = 1.0011313711Â….<br/>&gt; &gt; U = 1.001213696511Â…<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, J is 1.958 cents and U is 2.100 cents.  So these are<br/>&gt; approximate schismas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With the aforementioned commas the progression from Do = 1 up to<br/>2Do<br/>&gt; &gt; = 2 contained 612 cells (cell # 612 = 2Do = 2). Each one was<br/>&gt; &gt; determined by multiplying the preceding cell by the comma that<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; aligned to the cell to be known ( M or J or U ).<br/>&gt; &gt; It was noticed that the first 100 cells contain the relative<br/>tone<br/>&gt; &gt; frequencies of the extended scales of Pythagoras and Aristoxenus<br/>&gt; &gt; (bc) (21 tones per octaves each) emerged with exactness, so<br/>these<br/>&gt; &gt; tone frequencies were the references for expanding the<br/>progression<br/>&gt; &gt; up to cell # 612. The mentioned three commas that work<br/>cyclically<br/>&gt; &gt; produced all the tones of both extended scales a long the whole<br/>set<br/>&gt; &gt; of 612 cells.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why 612?

T.<br/>Bartholomew&apos;s &quot;Acoustics of Music&quot;, Joaquin Zamacois&apos;, &quot;Teor&iacute;a de la<br/>M&uacute;sica&quot;, M. Caillaud&apos;s, &quot;Notions D&apos;Acoustique&quot;, Julian<br/>Carrillo&apos;s     &quot;Sonido 13&quot; and other fascinating works.  Authors<br/>usually start analyzing the theme by studying the works of<br/>Pythagoras and Aristoxenus, Zarlino, William Holder, Ramos de<br/>Pareja, Delezenne and other well known researchers on the<br/>improvement of musical scales.<br/>All of us pay well-deserved homage to Pythagoras for his heptatonic<br/>scale set down about 550 BC.  Nearly 250 years later, Aristoxenus<br/>conceived a second heptatonic scale, also known as the scale of<br/>physicists and geometricians.  The work of these great researchers<br/>enabled the incipient audience of that era to listen to melodies<br/>that had only seven pitches per octave.  Then, at the beginning of<br/>the second millenium, sharps and flats were added to the heptatonic<br/>scales extending them to twenty-one pitches per octave, based on the<br/>Pythagoras and Aristoxenus scales.  At about 1560, Zarlino set out<br/>the &quot;commas&quot;, such as (81/80) = 1.0125 and Dr. Delezenne deduced the<br/>chromatic semitone 135/128.  In 1985, the smallest comma known was<br/>used: 1.00112915 = (32805 / 32768) = M, obtained by dividing the<br/>Delezenne and Pythagoras semitones, that is (135/128) &div; (256/243),<br/>which played a fundamental role in the establishment of an eminently<br/>good scale. Considering the transcendental contributions of Zarlino<br/>and Delezenne, they must also be included in our homage to the<br/>masters.<br/>In 1957, I had the opportunity to talk to one of the greatest guitar<br/>players of our time, Andr&eacute;s Segovia, in Lima during his concert tour<br/>period.  I asked him if he was satisfied with the quality of guitar<br/>chords.<br/>He wanted to know why I asked this question.  I told him that I had<br/>detected discords when playing the guitar, and that I could perceive<br/>a slight incoherence in the tone frequencies.  He replied that he<br/>did not approve such chords either, but that it was an old problem<br/>and he hoped to see it solved some day.<br/>Twenty-five years later, I decided to study the harmony problem.  I<br/>found interesting information in books from the National Library,<br/>but solving the problem seemed to require about as much work as<br/>finding the Philosophers&apos; stone.  In 1482 Ramos de Pareja proposed a<br/>dodecatonic scale, named &quot;Tempered&quot;, as a practical solution to<br/>imperfect chords.  The sole semitone factor T of the Tempered scale<br/>set the same frequency relation between any two consecutive notes<br/>within the octave. J. S. Bach introduced the Tempered scale in 1722.<br/>From 1994 to 1997, I wrote to manufacturers of musical instruments<br/>abroad, trying to convince them of the advantages of using a piano<br/>tuner ruled by the new scale.  I also sent them some computer-<br/>plotted graphs for comparing Tempered and &quot;Piagui&quot; chords, a term<br/>used for the new intonation.  Some of them replied, congratulating<br/>me on my endeavor to resolve the harmony problem, but that was all.<br/>At that time, I realized that the design of electronic organ<br/>keyboards and electronic tuners interrupted the use of all the<br/>hardware in their designs and products.  Most manufacturers were<br/>already using software.<br/>After long years of research, I finally decided to set down my<br/>findings and started writing this book in June 2002.  I apologize<br/>for including so many mathematical reasonings.  I had to avail<br/>myself this opportunity to provide the full and complete details on<br/>the subject.<br/>A well known analyst once stated, somewhat<br/>pessimistically:   &quot;Musical scale is not one, not natural or even<br/>founded necessarily on laws of constitution of musical sound, but<br/>very diverse, very artificial and very capricious&quot;.<br/>Chapter I of this book contain opinions and criticisms of the<br/>Tempered scale by notable analysts who, apparently, are resigned to<br/>listening forever to discords.  I hope that the research and<br/>analyses described herein will contribute to perfecting musical<br/>expression.<br/>I have set down here new concepts of the scientific basis of a new<br/>musical scale and its application in the manufacture of musical<br/>instruments.  Universities, musical students and analysts will find<br/>interesting information regarding micro-consonance and harmony, but<br/>it is desirable that the reader have some familiarity with basic<br/>concepts of music, moderate competence in mathematics and an<br/>elementary knowledge of physics.<br/>The roots of authentic musical elements, that is, the smallest comma<br/>M and the new J and U ones I detected, define the Natural<br/>Progression of Musical Cells, an able set of 624 relative<br/>frequencies from note Do = 1 up to (9/8)6.  Since several features<br/>of this progression acknowledge it as a scientific source of natural<br/>consonance, it deserves to be included in the acoustics field of<br/>physics.<br/>A concise explanation of the ancient Pythagoras and Aristoxenus<br/>heptatonic scales was made, emphasizing intervals between each two<br/>consecutive notes.  The treatment is based on limited information<br/>from the ancient scales, as well as on data contained in the Natural<br/>Progression of Musical Cells for detecting K and P semitone factors.<br/>When used properly, the combined work of K and P can set the needed<br/>twelve-tone frequencies for any octave, these being the most<br/>suitable for yielding aesthetic complex waves when the chord tone<br/>frequencies are computer-plotted and added to show perfect harmony.<br/>As most countries now use 440 cycles per second for note La, it is<br/>one of the pitches of the new middle octave.  The K and P semitone<br/>factors replace the tempered T and rule the harmony of the new<br/>musical system.  Their precise and suitable values determine that<br/>perfect fifths and perfect fourths link all tone frequencies of the<br/>piano keyboard in cycles.  These unexpected and remarkable results<br/>made possible the attainment of the best expressions of harmony.<br/>Mathematical analyses and the proposal presented here were made to<br/>resolve the problem of the slight discordance produced by the<br/>Tempered scale.  Some audiences who are able to distinguish discords<br/>detect small harmony imperfections.<br/>Chapter VIII analyzes the harmony of the Tempered and the Piagui<br/>scale.  Chord waves, as well as chord wave peaks, are plotted to<br/>compare them and decide on the qualities of harmony.  An examination<br/>of Piagui chord wave peaks detected aesthetic displays.  Compared<br/>with the new chords, where frequency ratios are exclusively K and P<br/>functions, the sum of tempered sinusoidal components yields non-<br/>aesthetic chord wave peaks, except for one diminished chord.  These<br/>are the origin of the discords that humans have endured since 1722.<br/>Chapter V deals with the application of the new scale to the piano,<br/>electronic organ, guitar and electronic tuner.  Sufficient data is<br/>given to permit manufacturers of musical instruments to introduce<br/>the new sound in harmony on the world market.<br/>On October 4th, 2003, the first string of the available Piagui<br/>guitar was tuned to obtain a 440 Hz corresponding to the note La.<br/>Then, by audible comparisons, the twelve reference tones of the<br/>middle octave on a grand piano were tuned and the tones extended<br/>throughout the keyboard.  When the pianist Luis E. Colmenares-<br/>Perales played the first of the classic works listened to that<br/>evening, he said enthusiastically: &quot;Not only the harmony but<br/>everything is clearly more pleasant than what is heard on a piano<br/>tuned to the Tempered scale&quot;.<br/>Major performers on the piano, electronic organ, guitar, cello and<br/>other instruments will be familiar with the new harmony produced by<br/>the new tone frequencies of C#, D, E, F, G, Ab, Bb and B.<br/>The Piagui scale can be distinguished from the Tempered scale when<br/>musical chords are maintained for the few tenths of a second<br/>required by the brain to classify the harmony.  Adagios, nocturnes,<br/>serenades and many, but not all, classical and selected pieces of<br/>music show the difference in the new musical system.  However,<br/>Chopin&apos;s Fantasia Impromptu and Rimsky-Korsakov&apos;s Flight of the<br/>Bumblebee do not demonstrate this difference.<br/>&#x9;The Piagui Musical Scale is not an invention; it is a<br/>discovery based on years of research on micro-consonance to resolve<br/>a problem that has existed since music was born.<br/>Mankind has sought and achieved, over millenia, the perfection of<br/>almost all things that are linked to him.  Musical harmony, with<br/>which we have lived for many centuries, was achieved and had only a<br/>small degree of imperfection left to solve.

At<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; beginning of the progression I had to deduced two additional<br/>commas<br/>&gt; &gt; J and U whose values are:<br/>&gt; &gt; J = 1.0011313711Â….<br/>&gt; &gt; U = 1.001213696511Â…<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, J is 1.958 cents and U is 2.100 cents.  So these are<br/>&gt; approximate schismas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With the aforementioned commas the progression from Do = 1 up to<br/>2Do<br/>&gt; &gt; = 2 contained 612 cells (cell # 612 = 2Do = 2). Each one was<br/>&gt; &gt; determined by multiplying the preceding cell by the comma that<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; aligned to the cell to be known ( M or J or U ).<br/>&gt; &gt; It was noticed that the first 100 cells contain the relative<br/>tone<br/>&gt; &gt; frequencies of the extended scales of Pythagoras and Aristoxenus<br/>&gt; &gt; (bc) (21 tones per octaves each) emerged with exactness, so<br/>these<br/>&gt; &gt; tone frequencies were the references for expanding the<br/>progression<br/>&gt; &gt; up to cell # 612. The mentioned three commas that work<br/>cyclically<br/>&gt; &gt; produced all the tones of both extended scales a long the whole<br/>set<br/>&gt; &gt; of 612 cells.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why 612?  There are about 614.2 schismas to an octave, so<br/>&gt; you&apos;re rounding off to a multiple of 12?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (2) Actually, the two equations with 4 variables are<br/>&gt; &gt; Km Pn = 2 (m and n are exponents)<br/>&gt; &gt; m + n = 12 (m and n are integer unknown numbers to be<br/>determined;<br/>&gt; &gt; the sum m + n gives the number of tones of the Piagui octave).<br/>&gt; &gt; K and P are the semitone factors that replace the only Tempered<br/>T = 2<br/>&gt; &gt; (to the exponent 1/12) = 1.05946309436Â….<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This means you&apos;re looking for a 12 note MOS with semitones<br/>&gt; called K and P.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (3) SPECIAL WAY  FOR SOLVING TWO EQUATIONS WITH 4 VARIABLES ( K,<br/>P,<br/>&gt; &gt; m, n) the K and P values must be near to the Tempered T because<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; sound discrepancy between Tempered and chord sounds are supposed<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; be small so K , P and T should have about the same magnitude.<br/>&gt; &gt; It was also assumed that K and P are cells of the progression.<br/>&gt; &gt; According to the preceding paragraph I took 6 cells that showed<br/>&gt; &gt; positive and negative differencies with respect to T. The T<br/>Tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; factor is not a cell of the progression.

I don&apos;t get the decimal values exact but they&apos;re<br/>&gt; near enough.  I still have no idea why these values are<br/>&gt; special or what the letters after the cell numbers mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By mathematical steps and using these 6 figures in 9 auxiliary<br/>&gt; &gt; equations, 9 results like the following figuries<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (#4)  n4 = (12 ln Kb Â– ln 2) / (ln Kb Â– ln Pa ) = 2.99901814321<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (#5)  n5 = (12 ln Kb Â– ln 2) / (ln Kb Â– ln Pb ) = 4<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ln =  neperian logaritm<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Huh?

The<br/>&gt; &gt; sequences need to be analyzed, since tone frequencies and chords<br/>&gt; &gt; will depend on the K and P arrangements within the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 21/12 is a way of writing the twelfth root of 2.  The rest<br/>&gt; is some form of technobabble for something like diminished<br/>&gt; temperament.  An open choice of K and P arrangements<br/>&gt; suggests the 12 note scale needn&apos;t be an MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Chapter III<br/>THE WIDE SPECTRUM OF<br/>NATURAL CONSONANCE<br/>III. 1 &#x9;THE NATURAL PROGRESSION OF MUSICAL CELLS<br/>Since the imperfection of the tempered scale is responsible for<br/>discords, as acknowledged by analysts and musicians, then musical<br/>instrument manufacturers should have the option of using a better<br/>intonation in order to perfect their instruments&apos; musical<br/>expression.<br/>Probably, a set of natural consonant frequencies could be deduced<br/>from the scientific scales of Pythagoras, Just Intonation and their<br/>extended scales.  Such a set might include a progression of commas<br/>ruled by mathematical and cyclical features in order to obtain the<br/>information needed to establish a new musical scale of twelve<br/>pitches per octave, to generate the expected harmony.<br/>A study of consonance derived from the Pythagoras and Just<br/>Intonation scales and the extremely useful comma sequence, permits<br/>detection of 612 relative frequencies comprised between C = 1 and<br/>octave 2C = 2.<br/>The successive application of the three types of commas M, J and U<br/>showed a set of 612 relative frequencies with respect to C = 1.<br/>These frequencies are termed cells whose values depend solely on<br/>numbers 2, 3 and 5.  Among the cells, the ten frequencies comprised<br/>in both heptatonic scales appear with high accuracy as well as the<br/>remaining frequencies included in the extended scales of Pythagoras,<br/>Just Intonation and those involved in musical elements for the first<br/>time.</p><p>The M, J and U values were deduced by using the heptatonic semitones<br/>256/243 and 16/15 as well as notes of the Pythagoras and Aristoxenus-<br/>Zarlino Extended Scales.  This origin gives commas, cells and<br/>segments, the scientific features that will set out the musical<br/>roots to perfecting harmony.<br/>Successive cycles of 9/8 were detected in the progression of<br/>relative frequencies.  If C is the base, the first segment ends on<br/>9/8.  The second one starts at 9/8 and goes up to (9/8)2.  The third<br/>segment covers the interval (9/8)2 to (9/8)3 and so on.  Each<br/>segment contains 104 commas, with M as the majority of them.  Fewer<br/>type J follow, and only four type U.<br/>All cells are distributed symmetrically with respect to the square<br/>root of the product of the segment&apos;s initial and the final cell.<br/>For example, the symmetrical center of the first segment (SC1) is<br/>given by          [1 x (9/8)]1/2.  The second symmetrical center<br/>(SC2) is given by                [(9/8) (9/8)2]1/2, the third one<br/>(SC3) by [(9/8)2 (9/8)3]1/2 and so on.<br/>The comma sequence in the first segment is enough to derive the<br/>sequence and values of the remaining cells up to the octave 2.  The<br/>sixth segment gives the final cell (9/8)6 = 2.02728652954 which is<br/>equal to 2B# of the Pythagoras extended scale.  When reduced to the<br/>first octave by dividing by 2, it gives another cell as well.  The<br/>M, J and U commas are the exclusive functions of 2, 3 and 5:</p><p>M = [(38 x 5) / 215] = [(32805 / 32768)] = 1.00112915039062<br/>J = [(225x21/4)/(313x52)] = [(33554432x21/4)/39858075]=1.001131371103<br/>U = [(212x 52 x 31/2) / 311] = [(102400 x 31/2)/177147] =<br/>1.0012136965066</p><p>Long ago, the quotient (32805 / 32768) = [(38 x 5) / 215] =<br/>1.00112915039 = M was deduced and termed &quot;comma&quot; or &quot;schisma&quot;, the<br/>smallest consonance that can be distinguished by ear, according to<br/>the analysts.  In 1986, the analyses assumed that at least one of<br/>the commas deduced centuries earlier, had to be one of the links in<br/>a set of micro-consonance.  It was a crucial and correct assumption.<br/>The chromatic interval (9/8) &div; (16/15) = (135 / 128) = 1.0546875 was<br/>proposed by physicist Delezenne who used the Zarlino semitones<br/>mentioned by J. Zamacois in his work &quot;Teor&iacute;a de la M&uacute;sica&quot;.  This<br/>value was derived from the natural intervals 9/8 and 16/15 of the<br/>Pythagoras and Just Intonation scales respectively.  The relation<br/>between the Delezenne chromatic semitone 135 / 128 and the<br/>Pythagoras semitone 256 / 243 gives the basic consonance M:<br/>(135 / 128) / (256 / 243) = (32805 / 32768) = 1.00112915039 = M.<br/>This was the origin of the fundamental comma M.<br/>The numerical procedure to define the 624 cells is easily understood<br/>when one cell of the progression is taken as an example, such as<br/>Cell No. 21, having a value of M13 J8 = 1.024.  When the M comma<br/>that produces Cell No. 22 multiplies 1.024, the result is:<br/>Cell No. 22 = (Cell No. 21 x M)<br/>= [1.024 (38 x 5) / 215] = M14 J8 = 1.02515625.<br/>In order to simplify the tabulation of 624 cells, the relative<br/>frequency values, expressed in terms of 2, 3, 5 have been omitted.<br/>In the following chapters, several tables concerning the Natural<br/>Progression of Musical Cells, the new musical scale and other data<br/>regarding harmony, make a study of the contents of this work a hard<br/>job.  It was not considered advisable to suppress any table and/or<br/>mathematical discussions involved with musical elements and the new<br/>scale harmonies that should be set out here.  Other subjects related<br/>to the proposal had to be set aside in order to avoid tiring the<br/>reader with the innumerable data.<br/>The following data are derived from the Natural Set of Relative<br/>Frequencies which, in its turn, arises from the scientific scales of<br/>Pythagoras and Aristoxenus-Zarlino.  The data given in several pages<br/>detail the authentic roots of the art of music.</p><p>Regards</p><p>MARIO PIZARRO<br/>ELECTRONIC ENGINEER<br/>(PIAGUISCALE)</p></div><h3><a id=76873 href="#76873">ðŸ”—</a>piaguiscale &#x3C;piagui@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2008 3:06:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;piaguiscale&quot; &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; piaguiscale wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So how exactly do M, J, and U enter into the calculation of K<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; P?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You have one equation in two variables and so an infinite<br/>&gt; number of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; possible solutions for K and P.

Such a set might include a progression of commas<br/>&gt; ruled by mathematical and cyclical features in order to obtain the<br/>&gt; information needed to establish a new musical scale of twelve<br/>&gt; pitches per octave, to generate the expected harmony.<br/>&gt; A study of consonance derived from the Pythagoras and Just<br/>&gt; Intonation scales and the extremely useful comma sequence, permits<br/>&gt; detection of 612 relative frequencies comprised between C = 1 and<br/>&gt; octave 2C = 2.<br/>&gt; The successive application of the three types of commas M, J and U<br/>&gt; showed a set of 612 relative frequencies with respect to C = 1.<br/>&gt; These frequencies are termed cells whose values depend solely on<br/>&gt; numbers 2, 3 and 5.  Among the cells, the ten frequencies<br/>comprised<br/>&gt; in both heptatonic scales appear with high accuracy as well as the<br/>&gt; remaining frequencies included in the extended scales of<br/>Pythagoras,<br/>&gt; Just Intonation and those involved in musical elements for the<br/>first<br/>&gt; time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The M, J and U values were deduced by using the heptatonic<br/>semitones<br/>&gt; 256/243 and 16/15 as well as notes of the Pythagoras and<br/>Aristoxenus-<br/>&gt; Zarlino Extended Scales.  This origin gives commas, cells and<br/>&gt; segments, the scientific features that will set out the musical<br/>&gt; roots to perfecting harmony.<br/>&gt; Successive cycles of 9/8 were detected in the progression of<br/>&gt; relative frequencies.  If C is the base, the first segment ends on<br/>&gt; 9/8.  The second one starts at 9/8 and goes up to (9/8)2.  The<br/>third<br/>&gt; segment covers the interval (9/8)2 to (9/8)3 and so on.  Each<br/>&gt; segment contains 104 commas, with M as the majority of them.<br/>Fewer<br/>&gt; type J follow, and only four type U.<br/>&gt; All cells are distributed symmetrically with respect to the square<br/>&gt; root of the product of the segment&apos;s initial and the final cell.<br/>&gt; For example, the symmetrical center of the first segment (SC1) is<br/>&gt; given by          [1 x (9/8)]1/2.  The second symmetrical center<br/>&gt; (SC2) is given by                [(9/8) (9/8)2]1/2, the third one<br/>&gt; (SC3) by [(9/8)2 (9/8)3]1/2 and so on.<br/>&gt; The comma sequence in the first segment is enough to derive the<br/>&gt; sequence and values of the remaining cells up to the octave 2.<br/>The<br/>&gt; sixth segment gives the final cell (9/8)6 = 2.02728652954 which is<br/>&gt; equal to 2B# of the Pythagoras extended scale.  When reduced to<br/>the<br/>&gt; first octave by dividing by 2, it gives another cell as well.  The<br/>&gt; M, J and U commas are the exclusive functions of 2, 3 and 5:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; M = [(38 x 5) / 215] = [(32805 / 32768)] = 1.00112915039062<br/>&gt; J = [(225x21/4)/(313x52)] = [(33554432x21/4)/39858075]<br/>=1.001131371103<br/>&gt; U = [(212x 52 x 31/2) / 311] = [(102400 x 31/2)/177147] =<br/>&gt; 1.0012136965066<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Long ago, the quotient (32805 / 32768) = [(38 x 5) / 215] =<br/>&gt; 1.00112915039 = M was deduced and termed &quot;comma&quot; or &quot;schisma&quot;, the<br/>&gt; smallest consonance that can be distinguished by ear, according to<br/>&gt; the analysts.  In 1986, the analyses assumed that at least one of<br/>&gt; the commas deduced centuries earlier, had to be one of the links<br/>in<br/>&gt; a set of micro-consonance.  It was a crucial and correct<br/>assumption.<br/>&gt; The chromatic interval (9/8) &div; (16/15) = (135 / 128) = 1.0546875<br/>was<br/>&gt; proposed by physicist Delezenne who used the Zarlino semitones<br/>&gt; mentioned by J. Zamacois in his work &quot;Teor&iacute;a de la M&uacute;sica&quot;.  This<br/>&gt; value was derived from the natural intervals 9/8 and 16/15 of the<br/>&gt; Pythagoras and Just Intonation scales respectively.  The relation<br/>&gt; between the Delezenne chromatic semitone 135 / 128 and the<br/>&gt; Pythagoras semitone 256 / 243 gives the basic consonance M:<br/>&gt; (135 / 128) / (256 / 243) = (32805 / 32768) = 1.00112915039 = M.<br/>&gt; This was the origin of the fundamental comma M.<br/>&gt; The numerical procedure to define the 624 cells is easily<br/>understood<br/>&gt; when one cell of the progression is taken as an example, such as<br/>&gt; Cell No. 21, having a value of M13 J8 = 1.024.  When the M comma<br/>&gt; that produces Cell No. 22 multiplies 1.024, the result is:<br/>&gt; Cell No. 22 = (Cell No. 21 x M)<br/>&gt; = [1.024 (38 x 5) / 215] = M14 J8 = 1.02515625.<br/>&gt; In order to simplify the tabulation of 624 cells, the relative<br/>&gt; frequency values, expressed in terms of 2, 3, 5 have been omitted.<br/>&gt; In the following chapters, several tables concerning the Natural<br/>&gt; Progression of Musical Cells, the new musical scale and other data<br/>&gt; regarding harmony, make a study of the contents of this work a<br/>hard<br/>&gt; job.  It was not considered advisable to suppress any table and/or<br/>&gt; mathematical discussions involved with musical elements and the<br/>new<br/>&gt; scale harmonies that should be set out here.  Other subjects<br/>related<br/>&gt; to the proposal had to be set aside in order to avoid tiring the<br/>&gt; reader with the innumerable data.<br/>&gt; The following data are derived from the Natural Set of Relative<br/>&gt; Frequencies which, in its turn, arises from the scientific scales<br/>of<br/>&gt; Pythagoras and Aristoxenus-Zarlino.

In these cases, there is no difference<br/>between the Tempered and the Piagui Scales.

The Piagui graph responses<br/>will show aesthetic displays during a one second period for the<br/>triads whose third component is a perfect fifth (3/2) = 1.5.  The<br/>triads with keynotes D, F, Ab, B, whose third components are<br/>concordant fifths (1.4949269), gave also perfect responses, the<br/>aesthetic displays are the features of this group of major triads,<br/>while Dm, Fm, Abm, Bm responses are better than the tempered ones.<br/>As a result, twenty perfect triads and four concordant ones make a<br/>total of twenty-four basic triads.<br/>The Piagui I responses of Major triads C, Eb, F# and A are similar<br/>and present 0, + 0.113% and + 0.113% discrepancies with respect to<br/>corresponding Tempered tone frequencies.  Consequently, only C Major<br/>triad will be plotted and discussed.</p><p>If t1 and t2 are constant, a triad is composed as follows:<br/>&#x9;sin (2O  f1t) + sin [2O  f2 (t Â– t1)] + sin [2O  f3 (t Â– t2)]<br/>The above sum of sinusoids can be plotted to get a chord wave. In<br/>this way plotting reveals whether the frequency components Â–with<br/>values of four or six place numbersÂ– are the proper ones to give the<br/>right harmony, depending on ratios f3 / f2 and f2 / f1.<br/>Comparisons between Tempered and Piagui triads must be made by<br/>computer and printer for any possible discussion of both kinds of<br/>harmony.<br/>Since the chord wave graphs were not precise enough to reach any<br/>clear and definite conclusions regarding harmony, another type of<br/>graph had to be used: chord wave peaks.  In this way, comparison<br/>resulted from an inspection of both Tempered and Piagui triads.<br/>Plotting chord waves and their peaks is probably the only way to<br/>encompass the object of harmony comparisons.  Through graph<br/>comparisons, peaks of the Piagui chord waves appear to satisfy the<br/>visual aesthetics, while tempered responses do not.  This method was<br/>chosen to provide a visualization of harmonious and discordant<br/>triads.<br/>In one second, an examination of Tempered and Piagui chord wave<br/>peaks showed irregular and aesthetic displays respectively, which<br/>correspond to flawed and true harmonies.<br/>In some cases, when looking at a chord wave response, the real<br/>harmony makes aesthetic wave areas that can be traced periodically,<br/>while the chord wave of an imperfect harmony describes disorderly<br/>and non-periodic waves.  In order to analyze clearly both types of<br/>responses, Tempered and Piagui chord waves and chord wave peaks,<br/>were drawn to attain definite conclusions regarding just and flawed<br/>harmony.<br/>The influence of chord wave peaks on the human ear has probably been<br/>studied, as many cases reveal the harmony or discordance of several<br/>sorts of chords if they are evaluated by their chord wave peak<br/>responses.<br/>When an instrument emits three frequencies, each component disturbs<br/>the atmospheric pressure of the environment independently of the<br/>other two components.  The foregoing sum of three sinusoids is the<br/>mathematical expression of a triad, where it is assumed that wave<br/>amplitudes are equal to one.  There are an infinite number of<br/>combinations of the three components, which depend on t1 and t2.<br/>Anyway, in all infinite cases the triad sound is the same.  One of<br/>them, the particular case of t1 = t 2 = 0 is given by:<br/>sin (2O  f1 t) + sin (2O  f2 t) + sin (2O  f3 t)<br/>For instance, Piagui I - G Major may be expressed as follows:<br/>G Major = (G + B + 2D)<br/>= sin [2O  (392.4383) t]+ sin [2O  (495) t] + sin [2O (2 &times; 294.32875) t]<br/>The following page shows the sum of three sinusoidal components that<br/>gets the chord wave of G Major in only 5.096 milliseconds.  The<br/>graph shows how computer and printer draw a chord wave.<br/>The Tempered and Piagui I frequencies of a particular octave are<br/>given in Table XIV on page 101.  These data are used to get chord<br/>waves of major and minor triads and their chord wave peaks.<br/>Actually, the sinusoidal components of any chord of a musical<br/>instrument are combined at random.  The preceding sum of three<br/>sinusoids is an unlikely case, since normally each sinusoidal wave<br/>works independently.  One particular case where two components are<br/>delayed with respect to the keynote is given here and plotted on<br/>Graphs Nos. 14 and 16.  The example is Piagui I - G Major.<br/>G Major = sin [2O  (392.4383) t] + sin [2O  (495) (t Â– 0.002)]<br/>&#x9;+ sin [2O  (588.6575) (t Â– 0.004)]<br/>The first sinusoidal component leads the second and third<br/>components.  By examining the graphs, we see that delays do not<br/>affect the periodicity of the complex wave nor the aesthetic<br/>response of chord wave peaks.  By applying the same delays to the<br/>Tempered chord, another shape of non-aesthetic display is revealed.<br/>THE COMPONENTS OF PIAGUI I Â– G MAJOR</p><p>VI. 1&#x9;THE MAJOR SCALE<br/>&#x9;The scale of C Major is made up of the following notes:<br/>&#x9;C&#x9;D&#x9;E&#x9;F&#x9;G&#x9;A&#x9;B&#x9;2C<br/>&#x9;1&#x9;2&#x9;3&#x9;4&#x9;5&#x9;6&#x9;7&#x9;8<br/>&#x9;(2)&#x9;(2)&#x9; (1)&#x9;(2)&#x9;(2)&#x9;(2)&#x9;(1)<br/>It is useful to note the numbering placed below each note of the<br/>scale as a guide to constructing all sorts of chords.  The number<br/>of  semitones between two consecutive notes is indicated in<br/>parentheses and applies to all major scales.<br/>C is the keynote, E is third, F is fourth and G is fifth and so on.<br/>The notes of all remaining major scales are named in the same way.<br/>The components of major triads are 1, 3, 5 (the keynote, third and<br/>fifth) while the minor triads are constructed by 1, b3, 5 where the<br/>third is lowered one semitone.<br/>The tones that form major and minor triads of the Piagui I scale and<br/>their frequency discrepancies with respect to the Tempered ones are<br/>given below.<br/>The following pages give the discrepant percentages of chord tone<br/>frequencies of the Piagui scale when compared to the corresponding<br/>tempered chord tones.  As noted, three degrees of discrepancy given<br/>by 0, &pm; 0.113% and &pm; 0.226% mark the difference between Tempered and<br/>Piagui chords.  Despite the fact that these discrepancies are very<br/>small, they make important changes in harmony as shown by chord wave<br/>peaks given in Chapter VIII.<br/>MARIO PIZARRO<br/>ELECTRONIC ENGINEER</p></div><h3><a id=77083 href="#77083">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2008 5:21:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have repeatedly asked how the circle of fifths looks in this tuning,<br/>i.e. what is the temperament in each fifth (never mind the 612<br/>separate cells!) - I have been unable to get any straight answer to<br/>this very simple question.

I.e. chop the Pythagorean comma into 4 and distribute the<br/>pieces equally round the circle. That&apos;s why C-Eb-F#-A are always<br/>equally tempered, in fact every minor third is the same as 12ET. The<br/>peculiar properties of the tuning, if any, must come from the fact<br/>that eight out of 12 fifths are pure.</p><p>(Of course, I did always acknowledge the presence of tempered fifths<br/>in the scale. For example C-G-D pure, D-A tempered by PC/4, A-E-B pure<br/>etc. etc.</p><p>So I can perfectly well also deal with fractions of a comma in<br/>temperament.

Building a scale by fifths is a lot<br/>easier than building by semitones.</p><p>One may have 612 cells per octave, but what is the point if you only<br/>ever use about 20 of them?<br/>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are the second and third layouts he mentioned:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Do=1) x K x P x K x K x P x K x K x P x K x K x P x K = 2<br/>&gt; K = 1.06066017178 = 101.955 cents<br/>&gt; P = 1.0570729911 = 96.090 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C     - 0 cents<br/>&gt; C#/Db - 101.955 cents<br/>&gt; D     - 198.045 cents<br/>&gt; D#/Eb - 300 cents<br/>&gt; E     - 401.955 cents<br/>&gt; F     - 498.045 cents<br/>&gt; F#/Gb - 600 cents<br/>&gt; G     - 701.955 cents<br/>&gt; G#/Ab - 798.045 cents<br/>&gt; A     - 900 cents<br/>&gt; A#/Bb - 1001.955 cents<br/>&gt; B     - 1098.045 cents<br/>&gt; C     - 1200 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Do=1) x P x K x K x P x K x K x P x K x K x P x K x K = 2<br/>&gt; K = 1.06066017178 = 101.955 cents<br/>&gt; P = 1.0570729911 = 96.090 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C     - 0 cents<br/>&gt; C#/Db - 96.090 cents<br/>&gt; D     - 198.045 cents<br/>&gt; D#/Eb - 300 cents<br/>&gt; E     - 396.090 cents<br/>&gt; F     - 498.045 cents<br/>&gt; F#/Gb - 600 cents<br/>&gt; G     - 696.090 cents<br/>&gt; G#/Ab - 798.045 cents<br/>&gt; A     - 900 cents<br/>&gt; A#/Bb - 996.090 cents<br/>&gt; B     - 1098.045 cents<br/>&gt; C     - 1200 cents<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=77161 href="#77161">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2008 7:16:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 1:43 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Here are the Scala files:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/svawfbkocs">http://www.box.net/shared/svawfbkocs</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Piagui I is the first layout, Piagui II the second, and Piagui III the third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is some interesting kind of diminished temperament.

It&apos;s a possibly useful temperament; it&apos;s just not new.  But, the lack of novelty doesn&apos;t necessarily diminish its value.</p><p>On harpsichord, the two different types of 5ths in it (pure vs 1/4 PC narrow) can *certainly* be distinguished in practice.  When 5ths or 12ths that severely tempered get played directly, in music with two-voiced texture, the impurity is obvious.  The vigorous vibrato of the beats stands out, in contrast with the steadiness of the pure 5ths.</p><p>As Mike mentioned, there are two different sizes of major 3rds in it.
