What the line between small and big<br/>is, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>I&apos;ve decided to sidestep &apos;Just Intonation&apos;, prime v/s odd limit,<br/>and consonant/dissonant polemics. I am not suggesting there is<br/>nothing of value there; quite the opposite. I feel I can easier<br/>progress toward an understanding of the issues raised by placing<br/>them within larger, more clearly defined contexts. I find it<br/>easier to think in terms of musical acoustics and the harmonic<br/>series, sans idealogical baggage, preconceptions, or prejudices.</p><p>I intend to continue my enquiry into these matters privately for<br/>now. When I&apos;ve developed my ideas further and have the music<br/>(fancy that !) to back it up, I&apos;ll speak up again.</p><p>The University of New South Wales, Sydney, has a web site on<br/>music acoustics at &lt;<a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/">http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/</a>&gt;, if<br/>anyone&apos;s interested.</p><p>And now for a few responses.</p><p>Paul Erlich :<br/>&gt; well, this kind of sidesteps the issue of anomalous saturated<br/>&gt; suspensions:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm</a></p><p>Thanks for pointing this out. And it looks like I may have side<br/>stepped the side stepping :)</p><p>Kraig Grady :<br/>&gt; I work with something for over 25 years,<br/>As I said, I have a lot of respect for everyone here.</p><p>&gt; you come along and tell me i should call it something<br/>&gt; else<br/>I did not.</p><p>&gt;  to suit your own bias for ET<br/>I have no bias toward any particular scale/tonal system or<br/>scheme, least of all equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; and imply that my reaction is religious.<br/>I did not.</p><p>Gene Ward Smith :<br/>To, &apos;...rational numbers, i.e. any number of the form p/q where<br/>p and q are integers (positive or negative) and q &ne; (is not<br/>equal to) 0.&apos; (Additional Mathematics, Patrick Murphy<br/>&gt; This isn&apos;t going to help much if we allow non-standard integers. :)</p><p>I&apos;ve just begun looking at what &apos;non-standard&apos; integers are -<br/>thanks a lot, Gene :-(. But, in the context of our discussion,<br/>does harmonic series involve intervals with &apos;non-standard<br/>integer&apos; ratios ?</p><p>To, &apos;&quot;Consonance&quot; is a subjective impression, much like &quot;Atonality&quot;.&apos;<br/>&gt; It means something a little different in discussions of &quot;odd limit&quot;<br/>&gt; harmonies, which was Robert&apos;s point.</p><p>Could you elaborate what definition/theory of consonance that<br/>would be ? Also, it was George Secor who said, &quot;the<br/>specification of a harmonic limit (e.g., 11-limit JI)<br/>automatically defines the consonances.&quot;.</p><p>&gt; As for atonality, why is that a subjective imp=<br/>&gt; ression? It seems to me you could define it statistically if<br/>&gt; you wanted to, =<br/>&gt; as a score which had no tonal center for lengths of time beyond<br/>&gt; some small a=<br/>&gt; mount. It certainly would be easy enough to produce triadic<br/>&gt; harmony with no =<br/>&gt; tonal center, and whatever subjective impression it gave, it<br/>&gt; would be atonal=<br/>&gt; .</p><p>For me such a piece of music would simply suggest something akin<br/>to several tonal centres. Pantonal ? maybe. See<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=352585">http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=352585</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt; the series of partial tones does not go on to infinity and consists<br/>&gt; of integer multiples of a fundamental only within some margin.</p><p>Theoretically is not the harmonic series infinite ?</p><p>Julia Werntz :</p><p>I look forward to reading your work at the earliest opportunity.<br/>I&apos;ve been in agreement with everything you&apos;ve said, in so far as I have the knowledge to do so.</p><p>&gt; One has to pick one&apos;s battles, sometimes. Probably in the<br/>&gt; future I will search for<br/>&gt; the perfect alternative term.</p><p>There is undeniably something unique going on with &apos;atonal&apos;<br/>music, so it would be nice to have a more descriptive term.<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s preference was apparently, &apos;pantonality&apos;. At least<br/>makes more sense than &apos;atonal&apos;.</p><p>&gt; If I write more essays, that is.</p><p>Please do ! I wonder if you&apos;ve encountered misconstruction of<br/>your work (or writing, at least) elsewhere as there&apos;s been here ?</p><p>To, &apos;My notion is that people who find a music &quot;atonal&quot; are like<br/>people who don&apos;t *get* Jazz.&apos;</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m just curious what you mean by this. Are you referring to<br/>&gt; those who use the<br/>&gt; term to describe, let&apos;s say &quot;pantonal&quot; music, in a derisive<br/>&gt; way, to mean something<br/>&gt; akin to &quot;amusical,&quot; because they fail to see the beauty and<br/>&gt; lyricism of Webern&apos;s<br/>&gt; music, for example?</p><p>Yes !</p><p>George Secor:</p><p>To my suggestion that many are drawn to microtonality in a quest<br/>for more pitches to play with, rather than a &apos;purer&apos; whatever.</p><p>&gt; Bravo!  But the next question is always, &quot;On what principle(s) shall<br/>&gt; I organize these new pitches?&quot;<br/>Indeed !</p><p>&gt; Whoever needs to make decisions about the future would be wise to<br/>&gt; understand the past.<br/>Yes.</p><p>&gt;   We arrived at 12-ET because it approximates the<br/>&gt; simplest rational intervals<br/>Yes. And, we now have the technology and science to explore much<br/>further than those simplest rational intervals.</p><p>&gt; If you are interested in writing &quot;tonal&quot; (as opposed to &quot;atonal&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;pantonal&quot;) music, then musical acoustics (and the mathematics of<br/>&gt; rational intervals) should be a significant factor in how you go<br/>&gt; about finding more pitches in the octave.</p><p>A basic understanding of musical acoustics would be good thing<br/>no matter what kind of music one wishes to write. To suggest<br/>otherwise is misleading. Dan Stearns&apos; comments were also right<br/>on the mark, especially when he says, &apos;Humans are a pretty<br/>enterprising and curious lot and not at all entirely bound by<br/>their physiology to blind obedience.&apos;. But you add the bit about<br/>rational intervals. Within the scope of musical acoustics, yes.<br/>Within the concept(s) of JI ? Only if one makes an informed<br/>decision to do so.</p><p>The rest of what you had to say about &apos;pantonal&apos; (for lack of a<br/>better term - &apos;atonal&apos; is a non-starter) music reveals a<br/>fundamental difference in the way you and I hear it. I hear it<br/>as quite the opposite of, &apos;an architect designing a building,<br/>but ignoring the laws of physics&apos;. I see it as more akin to an<br/>architect who understands the laws of physics in a manner that<br/>elevates it to art.</p><p>&gt; That said, I should quickly add that the element of &quot;creative<br/>&gt; impulse&quot; (in whatever form) in a musical composition outweighs all of<br/>&gt; our theorizing...</p><p>I agree wholeheartedly ! However, with regard to the mass appeal<br/>bit preceding this, personally I am not concerned with (nor have<br/>delusions of) writing music that will appeal to the majority of<br/>society.</p><p>To, &apos;But, 419914/404871 *is* within the harmonic series.&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Theoretically, yes; for all practical purposes, no.  You can&apos;t hear a<br/>&gt; harmonic that high in any musical tone because:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) It wouldn&apos;t have sufficient amplitude;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Either it or its fundamental (or both) would be out of our range<br/>&gt; of hearing.</p><p>But this is unimportant for theoretical scale construction using<br/>octave reduction. No ?</p><p>&gt; The size of the number is very important when you are dealing with<br/>&gt; musical acoustics.  What makes just intervals or chords &quot;just&quot;?  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; the elimination of roughness, i.e., perceived beating between off-<br/>&gt; tuned harmonics or combination tones.  Once the numbers reach a<br/>&gt; certain size, intervals begin to lose their identities, at which<br/>&gt; point they begin to sound like approximations of lower-numbered<br/>&gt; ratios.  Then they can no longer be considered distinct consonances.<br/>&gt; So there is a practical limit to which one can take a harmonic limit.</p><p>I was simply pointing out the error in your definition of a<br/>rational number. But, what is the cut-off point beyond which you<br/>would consider an interval to not be &apos;Just&apos; ?</p><p>&gt; Regarding one&apos;s unsuspecting friends: one of the challenges of<br/>&gt; writing a microtonal composition is to use new intervals without<br/>&gt; making the result sound as if it is out of tune.</p><p>Perceiving music as &apos;out of tune&apos; is a subjective thing, similar<br/>and related to concepts of consonance and dissonance.<br/>Consequently, what you suggest is not a goal of mine.</p><p>To, &apos;But, one may be thinking simply in terms of the harmonic<br/>series with no sense or need for a &quot;limit&quot;.&apos;<br/>&gt; Then one has failed to recognize that the extent to which a harmonic<br/>&gt; limit may be successfully employed is not unlimited.<br/>I disagree and stand by my original suggestion. Perhaps the<br/>differences in understanding (and aesthetics) lie in the<br/>distinctions of various conceptions of harmonic limit and<br/>consonance/dissonance. Unless JI proponents think they&apos;ve learnt<br/>all there is to know. The end of science ? ;-)</p><p>&gt; Where was it that we were talking about scales?<br/>Everywhere !</p><p>From the OED:<br/>Tuning: the process of putting a musical instrument in tune.<br/>In tune: having the correct pitch or intonation.<br/>It&apos;s provenance is the Greek &apos;teino&apos;, meaning &apos;stretch&apos;.</p><p>Scale: Mus. an arrangement of all the notes in a system of music<br/>in ascending or descending order.<br/>It&apos;s provenance is the Latin &apos;scala&apos; from &apos;scandere&apos;, meaning climb.</p><p>As I said, one tunes *to* a scale.</p><p>&gt; In stating that temperaments are non-rational tunings, one would not<br/>&gt; logically conclude that all non-rational tunings are temperments.<br/>Actually that is exactly the error you made, which I pointed out.</p><p>&gt; The term &quot;inharmonic&quot; is generally applied to timbres having non-<br/>&gt; harmonic partials, not to scales or tunings.<br/>My using it to refer to scales, chords, &amp; intervals is a logical<br/>extension. As consonance and dissonance are used to refer to all<br/>these things.</p><p>&gt; The term &quot;just intonation&quot; is widely accepted, and that is not likely<br/>&gt; to change for the foreseeable future.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to see that, given the intransigence of it&apos;s most<br/>vigorous proponents. Well, having taken my train of thought to<br/>it&apos;s logical course, I can more clearly state that I was merely<br/>seeking a way to work beyond the confines of &apos;Just Intonation&apos;.<br/>I did not even suggest an new term. Merely said I&apos;d like to just<br/>call the harmonic series the harmonics series. Even that benign<br/>unimpeachable notion turned out like ants in the pants for at<br/>least one person here ! :-) Remarkable. Uninteresting.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s always good to know that someone out there is thinking!<br/>Cogito ergo sum.</p><p>Existential tonality. That&apos;s how I can presently best describe<br/>the essence of what I&apos;m after :-)</p><p>BTW, any Turkish football fans here ? Kudos !!! Rustu rules !</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2002 11:48:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Joel Rodrigues &lt;joelrodrigues@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38310">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38310</a></p><p>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To comment on &amp; conclude for the most part my present public<br/>&gt; expression on these matters.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thank you so much for your post, Joel but it seemed from your<br/>discussion that you are going to be continuing some comments at some<br/>point.

This is meaningless if either the fundamentals or harmonics<br/>in question cannot be heard.  I was attempting to make this point in<br/>what I said next:</p><p>&gt; &gt; The size of the number is very important when you are dealing with<br/>&gt; &gt; musical acoustics.  What makes just intervals or chords &quot;just&quot;?<br/>It&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; the elimination of roughness, i.e., perceived beating between off-<br/>&gt; &gt; tuned harmonics or combination tones.

(I&apos;ll have more to say about definitions<br/>below.)</p><p>&gt; But, what is the cut-off point beyond which you<br/>&gt; would consider an interval to not be &apos;Just&apos; ?</p><p>I haven&apos;t decided exactly where that would be, but it would be above<br/>the 19 limit, and possibly below the 43 limit (I do know of a couple<br/>of uses for ratios of 41).  While I doubt that ratios of 17 and 19<br/>can be tuned by ear successfully by eliminating beats between<br/>harmonics, I have found that consonant chords can be created using<br/>these intervals if the difference tones can be made to coincide,<br/>e.g., 13:16:19:22 or 13:17:21:25.  By &quot;consonant&quot; I mean that you can<br/>hear something go out of tune if you mistune one of the tones.  This<br/>is the sort of phenomenon that defines the whole concept of &quot;just<br/>intonation&quot; and makes it so attractive to its advocates.</p><p>I suspect that the cut-off point you asked about would be arrived at<br/>when the harmonic entropy (or disorder) becomes large enough that the<br/>collective dissonance produced by beating harmonics (and whatever) in<br/>a chord significantly outweighed the consonance connected with<br/>coincident difference (and other combinational) tones.  I&apos;ll have to<br/>experiment with this sometime to see if I can reach any definite<br/>conclusion.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Regarding one&apos;s unsuspecting friends: one of the challenges of<br/>&gt; &gt; writing a microtonal composition is to use new intervals without<br/>&gt; &gt; making the result sound as if it is out of tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perceiving music as &apos;out of tune&apos; is a subjective thing, similar<br/>&gt; and related to concepts of consonance and dissonance.<br/>&gt; Consequently, what you suggest is not a goal of mine.</p><p>One could intentionally use a microtonal scale to parody a<br/>conventional diatonic scale (to give the impression that it is out of<br/>tune) to portray a drunken or disoriented character in a piece of<br/>music.  I believe that success of this effect would depend mostly on<br/>the skill of the composer and very little on the listener (assuming<br/>that the listener has previously heard diatonic music played in tune).</p><p>Likewise I believe that it is possible for a composer to control the<br/>various factors (whatever they may be) that will determine whether or<br/>not a piece of music will sound strange and different or whether it<br/>will merely sound out of tune.  I remember the first time I ever<br/>heard a recording of a Javanese gamelan -- it sounded quite unlike<br/>anything I had ever heard before, but it definitely didn&apos;t sound out<br/>of tune.</p><p>&gt; To, &apos;But, one may be thinking simply in terms of the harmonic<br/>&gt; series with no sense or need for a &quot;limit&quot;.&apos;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then one has failed to recognize that the extent to which a<br/>harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; limit may be successfully employed is not unlimited.</p><p>&gt; I disagree and stand by my original suggestion.

Unless JI proponents think they&apos;ve learnt<br/>&gt; all there is to know. The end of science ? ;-)</p><p>Then we will agree to disagree.</p><p>Just for the record, I&apos;m neither a JI nor an ET partisan -- my<br/>preference is actually for what has lately been called &quot;middle path&quot;<br/>tunings, which for me include well-temperaments and near-just<br/>temperaments.  But I have tried to formulate definitions or<br/>descriptions of &quot;just intonation&quot; and &quot;consonance&quot; that are both<br/>useful and meaningful, whatever one&apos;s tuning preference may be.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Where was it that we were talking about scales?<br/>&gt; Everywhere !</p><p>Most of what I had to say about just intonation and rational numbers<br/>had to do with intervals and chords, and I don&apos;t think I mentioned<br/>scales until you brought them up.  (See below.)</p><p>&gt;  From the OED:<br/>&gt; Tuning: the process of putting a musical instrument in tune.<br/>&gt; In tune: having the correct pitch or intonation.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s provenance is the Greek &apos;teino&apos;, meaning &apos;stretch&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scale: Mus. an arrangement of all the notes in a system of music<br/>&gt; in ascending or descending order.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s provenance is the Latin &apos;scala&apos; from &apos;scandere&apos;, meaning climb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I said, one tunes *to* a scale.</p><p>I don&apos;t ordinary think of a scale as all of the tones in a system or<br/>tuning (although that&apos;s one of its definitions), but rather as a<br/>subset of that system or tuning.  You seemed to be using the word<br/>that way when you were making a distinction between the two:</p><p>&lt;&lt; This is partly correct. First it is scales we&apos;re concerned in this<br/>instance, not tunings. &gt;&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s counter-productive to quote a definition for a word out of a<br/>dictionary (and not even a music dictionary) when a somewhat<br/>different definition is being used in the discussion.</p><p>Anyway, not to belabor the point, I think that it&apos;s *tones sounded<br/>simultaneously* (i.e., intervals and chords rather than scales or<br/>tunings) that are more relevant to our discussion of what is just<br/>intonation and what is consonant.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In stating that temperaments are non-rational tunings, one would<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; logically conclude that all non-rational tunings are temperments.<br/>&gt; Actually that is exactly the error you made, which I pointed out.</p><p>I was trying to say that I didn&apos;t make that (or some such) error, but<br/>that it appeared that you inferred that I had.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The term &quot;inharmonic&quot; is generally applied to timbres having non-<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic partials, not to scales or tunings.<br/>&gt; My using it to refer to scales, chords, &amp; intervals is a logical<br/>&gt; extension. As consonance and dissonance are used to refer to all<br/>&gt; these things.</p><p>All I can say is, watch your definitions and usages of terms.  If you<br/>aren&apos;t careful with them, you&apos;re going to misunderstand others and<br/>also be misunderstood.  Dictionaries are limited in their helpfulness<br/>when words have multiple meanings; get the particular meanings that<br/>others are using by taking everything in context.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The term &quot;just intonation&quot; is widely accepted, and that is not<br/>likely<br/>&gt; &gt; to change for the foreseeable future.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s easy to see that, given the intransigence of it&apos;s most<br/>&gt; vigorous proponents.</p><p>The term is found in virtually all music dictionaries and<br/>encylopedias, which, if they could be called partisan in any way, are<br/>almost always pro-equal temperament.  So your feud is not only with<br/>the JI partisans.

You can&apos;t hear a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; harmonic that high in any musical tone because:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) It wouldn&apos;t have sufficient amplitude;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Either it or its fundamental (or both) would be out of our range<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; of hearing.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But this is unimportant for theoretical scale construction using<br/>&gt;&gt; octave reduction. No ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The traditional concept of just intonation involves intervals in<br/>&gt; which the roughness due to beating harmonics is eliminated when the<br/>&gt; harmonics are made to coincide (i.e., just tuning = elimination of<br/>&gt; beats).  This is meaningless if either the fundamentals or harmonics<br/>&gt; in question cannot be heard.  I was attempting to make this point in<br/>&gt; what I said next:</p><p>You say &apos;for all practical purposes, no&apos;, which I deduce from your further comment that this is with ref. to JI. Which was never my question. The harmonic series *is* theoretically infinite. 2:1 reduction allows us to go as far up the harmonic series as we choose. Whether someone thinks that the harmonic series is musically valid only up to a certain limit, is besides the point, and arguably (I&apos;m almost afraid to use that word in this forum:-)) a matter of personal taste.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I was simply pointing out the error in your definition of a<br/>&gt;&gt; rational number.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where did I give an erroneous definition of &quot;rational number&quot; or use<br/>&gt; the term incorrectly?</p><p>OK, it seems as though I was confused by this:<br/>&quot;JI includes only systems or sets of tones related by intervals that are defined as small-number (i.e., rational) ratios.&quot;<br/>Where you seem to be equating &apos;small-number&apos; to &apos;rational&apos;, practically implying that 419914/404871 is not rational. So, to get back to Robert Walker&apos;s original question, 419914/404871 may not be a &apos;Just&apos; interval (as in &apos;Just Intonation&apos;), I don&apos;t care to take a stand as I seem to have found a way to think and work beyond that, but it is a rational interval (as in Rational Intonation), as well as a harmonic interval (as in Harmonic Intonation, and before anyone pounces, I&apos;ve done my homework on this turn of phrase).</p><p>&gt;&gt; But, what is the cut-off point beyond which you<br/>&gt;&gt; would consider an interval to not be &apos;Just&apos; ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t decided exactly where that would be, but it would be above<br/>&gt; the 19 limit, and possibly below the 43 limit (I do know of a couple<br/>&gt; of uses for ratios of 41).  While I doubt that ratios of 17 and 19<br/>&gt; can be tuned by ear successfully by eliminating beats between<br/>&gt; harmonics, I have found that consonant chords can be created using<br/>&gt; these intervals if the difference tones can be made to coincide,<br/>&gt; e.g., 13:16:19:22 or 13:17:21:25.  By &quot;consonant&quot; I mean that you can<br/>&gt; hear something go out of tune if you mistune one of the tones.  This<br/>&gt; is the sort of phenomenon that defines the whole concept of &quot;just<br/>&gt; intonation&quot; and makes it so attractive to its advocates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect that the cut-off point you asked about would be arrived at<br/>&gt; when the harmonic entropy (or disorder) becomes large enough that the<br/>&gt; collective dissonance produced by beating harmonics (and whatever) in<br/>&gt; a chord significantly outweighed the consonance connected with<br/>&gt; coincident difference (and other combinational) tones.  I&apos;ll have to<br/>&gt; experiment with this sometime to see if I can reach any definite<br/>&gt; conclusion.</p><p>Thank you for this, George. It helps with *my* (_evolving_) understanding of JI as a conception of a &apos;beatless aesthetic&apos;, as Margo once put it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding one&apos;s unsuspecting friends: one of the challenges of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; writing a microtonal composition is to use new intervals without<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; making the result sound as if it is out of tune.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Perceiving music as &apos;out of tune&apos; is a subjective thing, similar<br/>&gt;&gt; and related to concepts of consonance and dissonance.<br/>&gt;&gt; Consequently, what you suggest is not a goal of mine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One could intentionally use a microtonal scale to parody a<br/>&gt; conventional diatonic scale (to give the impression that it is out of<br/>&gt; tune) to portray a drunken or disoriented character in a piece of<br/>&gt; music.  I believe that success of this effect would depend mostly on<br/>&gt; the skill of the composer and very little on the listener (assuming<br/>&gt; that the listener has previously heard diatonic music played in tune).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Likewise I believe that it is possible for a composer to control the<br/>&gt; various factors (whatever they may be) that will determine whether or<br/>&gt; not a piece of music will sound strange and different or whether it<br/>&gt; will merely sound out of tune.  I remember the first time I ever<br/>&gt; heard a recording of a Javanese gamelan -- it sounded quite unlike<br/>&gt; anything I had ever heard before, but it definitely didn&apos;t sound out<br/>&gt; of tune.</p><p>&gt;&gt; To, &apos;But, one may be thinking simply in terms of the harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt; series with no sense or need for a &quot;limit&quot;.&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Then one has failed to recognize that the extent to which a<br/>&gt; harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; limit may be successfully employed is not unlimited.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I disagree and stand by my original suggestion. Perhaps the<br/>&gt;&gt; differences in understanding (and aesthetics) lie in the<br/>&gt;&gt; distinctions of various conceptions of harmonic limit and<br/>&gt;&gt; consonance/dissonance.

I generally think of a scale as a subset of a tuning or<br/>tonal system, e.g., a major or minor scale as a subset of any number<br/>of different tunings (by which word I am including temperaments).<br/>And if I am going to choose an organization of tones (say 5 to 10 in<br/>number) out of a system such as 31-ET or 72-ET to write a melody,<br/>what would I call call that set of tones, if not a scale?</p><p>Now if you consider this incorrect use of terminology, I guess you&apos;re<br/>entitled to your own opinion; but don&apos;t expect everyone else to<br/>assume that immediately.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In stating that temperaments are non-rational tunings, one<br/>would not<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; logically conclude that all non-rational tunings are<br/>temperments.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually that is exactly the error you made, which I pointed out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was trying to say that I didn&apos;t make that (or some such) error,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; that it appeared that you inferred that I had.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Any tuning in which a rational interval (no matter how small)<br/>&gt; vanishes is by definition a temperament, not a rational tuning.&quot;<br/>&gt; What you said.</p><p>We&apos;ve gone around in a circle without resolving anything and are<br/>still talking past one another.  I give up!</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All I can say is, watch your definitions and usages of terms.  If<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; aren&apos;t careful with them, you&apos;re going to misunderstand others and<br/>&gt; &gt; also be misunderstood.  Dictionaries are limited in their<br/>helpfulness<br/>&gt; &gt; when words have multiple meanings; get the particular meanings<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; others are using by taking everything in context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am extremely careful (but not infallible) with the words I<br/>&gt; use. The new thread about the misuse, inconsistency, and overall<br/>&gt; weirdness in commonly used mainstream musical terminology raises<br/>&gt; a long overdue issue. I know what I&apos;m talking about in the above<br/>&gt; particular case, and I&apos;ve done enough research into it (before<br/>&gt; discussing it in public) to know my logic is correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just because I enter a room where a bunch of people insist on<br/>&gt; calling a dog a cat, is not going to intimidate me into joining<br/>&gt; in the absurdity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dictionaries are invaluable. And I always look into a word&apos;s<br/>&gt; etymology to be reasonably certain I know what I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>Then I know you&apos;ll enjoy Joe Monzo&apos;s dictionary, if you haven&apos;t<br/>already see it:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict</a></p><p>There&apos;s a lot of good stuff in there, and it&apos;s being updated all the<br/>time.

Additionally, it includes some complex RI ratios such as<br/>64:81:96 treated in practice and theory as _relatively_ &quot;concordant,&quot;<br/>but not involving any obvious HI or CI relationship, since the numbers<br/>are so large.</p><p>More generally, the term &quot;JI&quot; in its classic usage seems to imply an<br/>RI system (all intervals defined by integer ratios) where at least<br/>some of these ratios also fit an HI or CI category.</p><p>(However, the kind of &quot;perceptual JI&quot; discussed by Dave Keenan, and<br/>also &quot;adaptive JI&quot; as discussed by Paul Erlich and others, often<br/>involve the elements of audible HI or CI without the element of a<br/>tuning system based on integer ratios only -- see the discussion near<br/>the end of this article.)</p><p>Many of the &quot;What is JI?&quot; debates tend to focus on what I would<br/>consider rather exceptional systems where complex RI generators or<br/>sets of intervals are used without any HI or CI intervals.<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s 12-EDO approximation of 1766 using a generator of<br/>10935:8192 (almost identical to a 500-cent fourth) could provide one<br/>example, and an instrument fretted in 25:24 steps as an approximation<br/>of 17-EDO could provide another.</p><p>In these instances, we have a rational approximation of an irrational<br/>temperament, where the very large integer ratios seem to have little<br/>connection to the HI or CI themes typical of the JI outlook.</p><p>Turning to more typical JI systems, I would like to affirm that the<br/>set of RI intervals is indeed unbounded, and that very large ratios<br/>indeed may be generated by systems such as Pythagorean or 2-3-prime<br/>intonation.</p><p>However, with George Secor I would agree that from an HI or even CI<br/>viewpoint, the range of independently significant ratios does have<br/>some limit, even if it is difficult to define with any precision.<br/>The music of LaMonte Young is famous for making impressively large<br/>ratios perceptibly &quot;harmonic&quot; or &quot;combinatorial.&quot;</p><p>Of course, very large ratios may also have great HI or CI<br/>significance, but because they closely &quot;converge&quot; with simpler<br/>ratios in what Joe Monzo and I have sometimes called a &quot;xenharmonic<br/>bridge.&quot; Thus I speak of &quot;_independent_ significance&quot; from an HI/CI<br/>viewpoint as a quality mainly of small to &quot;intermediate&quot; ratios.</p><p>In describing the HI or CI side of JI, I might propose the term<br/>&quot;correspondence&quot; to describe the matching or blending of harmonic<br/>partials or combinatorial tones.</p><p>Thus for JI systems premised on an &quot;n-odd-limit,&quot; one might say that<br/>this limit defines the scope of deliberate correspondence.</p><p>I find &quot;correspondence&quot; possibly a preferable term to &quot;consonance,&quot;<br/>since the latter can often be a graduated spectrum in a given<br/>practical or theoretical tradition. Thus in a Gothic Pythagorean<br/>setting, a regular third at 81:64 or 32:27 is typically accorded a<br/>considerable degree of &quot;partial concord,&quot; but does not necessarily<br/>imply what we might call HI or CI &quot;correspondence.&quot;</p><p>One trait of classic JI systems is that simpler ratios with HI or CI<br/>qualities tend to &quot;ramify&quot; into more complex RI intervals. This is a<br/>different kind of structure, at least in intention, than where large<br/>RI ratios are chosen to approximate some irrational temperament.</p><p>Thus one might call a system of rational ratios without any HI or CI<br/>intervals as &quot;formally JI,&quot; but not &quot;typically JI.&quot;</p><p>Historically, I might consider a point made by scholars such as Bill<br/>Alves and Jacky Ligon: the _melodic_ aspects of a JI system, for<br/>example the use of superparticular steps, may in some traditions play<br/>at least as important a role as the express or inferred HI or CI<br/>aspects. For example, the rational tunings of ancient Greek and the<br/>medieval Near East could be using steps such as 12:11 as much for<br/>their melodic qualities as for any vertical &quot;correspondence&quot; of these<br/>intervals.</p><p>In my view, the mixture of simpler (HI and CI) with more complex (RI)<br/>intervals is one of the main attractions of JI, permitting variety and<br/>contrast.</p><p>Thus I would say that _any_ integer-based interval is a legitimate<br/>element which could be included in some JI systems, while recognizing<br/>at the same time that in a typical JI system, HI and/or CI intervals<br/>play an important role.</p><p>To put this in terms like those of Paul Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy,<br/>subject always to his friendly and helpful correction or<br/>clarification:</p><p>             (1) A JI system typically includes some small integer<br/>                 or &quot;lower entropy&quot; ratios which combine to<br/>                 generate larger integer ratios with a &quot;higher<br/>                 entropy effect.&quot;</p><p>             (2) Sometimes simple HI or CI ratios may combine to<br/>                 generate larger integer ratios closely &quot;converging&quot;<br/>                 with smaller ratios, and thus having a similar<br/>                 &quot;lower entropy&quot; effect, like a slightly tempered<br/>                 version of the simpler ratio.</p><p>Thus &quot;JI&quot; itself is an open concept, having a scope including the set<br/>of all rational ratios (RI), but HI or CI implies a kind of vertical<br/>correspondence generally implying &quot;not-too-large&quot; ratios.</p><p>The usual convention that &quot;typical JI&quot; systems include _some_ HI or CI<br/>intervals recognizes both the openness and the generally implied<br/>structure of a system of &quot;just&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; intonation.</p><p>Having suggested this approach to &quot;classic JI&quot; (all RI ratios, some HI<br/>or CI ratios), I might add that contributors here such as Dave Keenan<br/>have proposed a &quot;perceptual&quot; definition of &quot;JI&quot; as &quot;audibly HI,&quot;<br/>whatever mathematical concepts the performers might or might not<br/>entertain about what they are doing.</p><p>Also, in &quot;adaptive JI,&quot; HI or CI sonorities result from intonational<br/>systems involving some irrational intervals -- whether in a fixed<br/>tuning such as Nicola Vicentino&apos;s evident scheme of 1555 and 1561<br/>based on two 19-note gamuts in 1/4-comma meantone at 1/4 comma apart,<br/>or in the flexible adaptive tuning algorithms of a Bill Sethares or<br/>John deLaubenfels.</p><p>Again, as Dave Keenan might emphasize, performers on flexible pitch<br/>instruments such as the human voice might achieve this result with or<br/>without the influence of a mathematical model of tuning. Barbershop<br/>singing, and the kind of Renaissance intonation achieved by Bob<br/>Wendell and his choral group, are possible examples -- with the<br/>theoretical or mathematical outlook of the performers likely varying</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2002 7:25:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello George!<br/>    You can also find thus type of chord formation with common difference tones also in Augusto Novaro.
