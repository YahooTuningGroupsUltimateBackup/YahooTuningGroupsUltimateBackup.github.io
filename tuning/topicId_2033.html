Triangular is better than rectangular.</p><p>For octave-equivalent lattices, I totally agree, and perhaps Joe Monzo<br/>is coming around on this too. But for octave-specific lattices, an (n*d)<br/>measure of complexity would be handled by a rectangular lattice with<br/>prime axes (or, equivalently as far as the city-block metric is<br/>concerned, a Monzo-type lattice with an additional axis for octaves) and<br/>lengths proportional to the log of the axes. This is equivalent to<br/>Tenney&apos;s harmonic distance if he included a 2-axis (anyone know if he<br/>did or didn&apos;t)? I now see where Graham Breed was coming from in<br/>supporting rectangular lattices for octave-specific lattices.</p><p>The reason omitting the 2-axis forces one to make the lattice triangular<br/>is that typically many more powers of two will be needed to bring a<br/>product of prime factors into close position than to bring a ratio of<br/>prime factors into close position. So the latter should be represented<br/>by a shorter distance than the former. Simply ignoring distances along<br/>the 2-axis and sticking with a rectangular (or Monzo) lattice is<br/>throwing away information.</p><p>&gt;2. &quot;Euclidean&quot; distance isn&apos;t good for much.</p><p>Yeah, city-block all the way.</p><p>&gt;3. Weighting by (n*d) is trivial.  If you add the results of each rung<br/>on<br/>&gt;the way to the target, you get nonsense.  If you multiply, you get<br/>(n*d) of<br/>&gt;the original fraction.</p><p>Or add the logs (like Tenney).</p><p>&gt;4. Because they are useful for measuring dyads, (n+d),<br/>whole-number-limit,<br/>&gt;and odd-limit all seem like viable ways to weight the rungs.  But I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt;see how anything is gained by weighting on an octave-equivalent<br/>lattice.<br/>&gt;Simply counting the rungs in the shortest path to target at the<br/>declared<br/>&gt;odd-limit (ala Paul Hahn&apos;s consistency and diameter) is the pinnacle of<br/>&gt;city block metrics.  Somebody please get on and say any reason this<br/>would<br/>&gt;not be so.</p><p>Because one wants lattice distance to be directly related to complexity!<br/>In the Breed-Tenney case, complexity is sqrt(n*d), and distance is<br/>log(n*d), so distance is 2*log(complexity). In my case, the complexity<br/>is the odd limit, and distance is log(odd limit), so distance is<br/>log(complexity).</p><p>&gt;5. A 2-axis is probably not desirable.  If it is, some form of<br/>weighting<br/>&gt;would likely be needed; a weight of log(axis) is suggested.</p><p>right . . . a weight of log(axis) should be applied to all axes, and if<br/>a 2-axis is included, a rectangular lattice is OK. If a 2-axis is not<br/>included, a triangular lattice is better.</p></div><h3><a id=2122 href="#2122">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/1999 7:28:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;3.

In an octave-specific sense,<br/>7:1 and 5:1 really are simpler than 7:5; the former are more consonant. 7:4<br/>and 5:4 are each three rungs in the rectangular lattice, but they still come<br/>out a litle simpler than 7:5 since the rungs along the 2-axis are so short.<br/>If you can buy that 35:1 is as simple as 7:5, then the octave-specific<br/>lattice really should be rectangular, not triangular. 35:1 is really<br/>difficult to compare with 7:5 -- it&apos;s much less rough but also much harder<br/>to tune . . .</p></div><h3><a id=2152 href="#2152">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/1999 6:24:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;If you&apos;d been following the discussion, you&apos;d see that I too mistook Paul<br/>&gt;&gt;H&apos;s algorithm as assuming primes, in contrast to his stance on odds vs.<br/>&gt;&gt;primes, but he then claimed that he had been assuming odds all along. Since<br/>&gt;&gt;the example that accompanied his algorithm only had 3-component vectors<br/>&gt;&gt;(3,5,7), there was in fact no possible basis for deciding whether the<br/>&gt;&gt;components were to be primes or odds on the basis of that one post alone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I just went back over the whole thread, and I see your point.</p><p>This thread has been rather hard to follow, but I don&apos;t see his point.  If<br/>there&apos;s one person who&apos;s been clear from the beginning, it is Paul H.  His<br/>original example mentioned the odds 9 and 15, and a general method for odd<br/>factorization.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The problem with Hahn&apos;s intended algorithm is that it needs one additional<br/>&gt;&gt;parameter, the odd limit of the lattice, in order to be unambiguous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, and it was his apparent failure to appreciate that this is a problem,<br/>&gt;that led me to think he may have been saying &quot;odd&quot; but still thinking<br/>&gt;&quot;prime&quot;. But now I realise that it probably isn&apos;t a problem for his<br/>&gt;intended use of this metric (difficulty of singing). It *is* a problem for<br/>&gt;our intended use as the basis for a dissonance metric.</p><p>It was I who first pointed out Paul H&apos;s odd-factoring requires a declared<br/>odd limit, although I consider this obvious, and I disagree that it is a<br/>problem.  Erlich&apos;s metric is no different -- just Hahn&apos;s with odd limit<br/>infinity.</p><p>Log weighting does merge prime and odd limits up to the declared limit,<br/>although I don&apos;t see why this is desirable.</p><p>&gt;The shortest path on an &lt;snip&gt; triangular lattice &lt;snip&gt; was worth looking<br/>&gt;at. But now that I&apos;ve considered it, I have to agree that for purposes of<br/>&gt;predicting dyadic dissonance, prime factorisation is pointless. In fact<br/>all &gt;factorisations are pointless and therefore lattice distances are<br/>pointless &gt;whether triangular or rectangular. Not that you can&apos;t make some<br/>of them &gt;work, it&apos;s just that there are easier ways of doing it that give<br/>better &gt;results (or at least the same).</p><p>Amen!</p></div>
