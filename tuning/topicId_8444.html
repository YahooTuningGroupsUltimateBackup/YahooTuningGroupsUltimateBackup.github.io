The notation with diatonic names is not ideal<br/>because for example the major third and seventh are very out of tune.<br/>The new notation is based on Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic scale<br/>Standard Pentachordal Major (2 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 2 2).<br/>The 10 natural names were chosen C H D E F J G A K B.<br/>This scale does not consist of a single chain of fifths but a double<br/>one. This introduces one inconsistency with respect to the traditional<br/>names which is that D - A is not a 22-tET fifth (13 steps) but a<br/>22-tET fifth flat by a syntonic comma (12 steps). So the two<br/>fifth-chains are K F C G D - A E B J H<br/>or, in a 2-dimensional lattice</p><p>     A E B J H<br/>  K F C G D</p><p>This one inconsistency seems preferable above substituting A, E and B<br/>(or C, G and D) with other letters. This way, C D E F G A B C is still<br/>the best approximation to the major scale in 22-tET.</p><p>  0:          1/1           C   Hbb<br/>  1:         54.545 cents   C#  Hb<br/>  2:        109.091 cents   H   Dbb<br/>  3:        163.636 cents   H#  Db<br/>  4:        218.182 cents   D<br/>  5:        272.727 cents   D#  Ebb<br/>  6:        327.273 cents   Dx  Eb<br/>  7:        381.818 cents   E   Fbb<br/>  8:        436.364 cents   E#  Fb<br/>  9:        490.909 cents   F   Jbb<br/> 10:        545.455 cents   F#  Jb<br/> 11:        600.000 cents   J   Gbb<br/> 12:        654.545 cents   J#  Gb<br/> 13:        709.091 cents   G<br/> 14:        763.636 cents   G#  Abb<br/> 15:        818.182 cents   Gx  Ab<br/> 16:        872.727 cents   A   Kbb<br/> 17:        927.273 cents   A#  Kb<br/> 18:        981.818 cents   K   Bbb<br/> 19:       1036.364 cents   K#  Bb<br/> 20:       1090.909 cents   B   Cbb<br/> 21:       1145.455 cents   B#  Cb<br/> 22:          2/1           C   Hbb</p><p>So the meaning of # and b is one scale step, and not the Pythagorean<br/>apotome, which is a very extreme three steps in 22-tET.<br/>The chords 4:5:6:7 in this scale are C-E-G-K, J-K-H-E and G-B-D-F.<br/>An effect of the double fifth chain is that modulating by a fifth<br/>does not introduce one sharp, but two:<br/>C H# D# E F J G A K B C.<br/>And by a fourth it gives two flats:<br/>C H D E F J G Ab Kb B C.<br/>For a moment I thought about choosing Fokker&apos;s semi-augmented and<br/>semi-diminished signs instead of the normal sharp and flat since one<br/>step is about a quarter tone, but discarded this possibility because<br/>the minor third is better notated with C-Eb.<br/>Paul&apos;s Standard Pentachordal Minor mode is notated as<br/>C H D Eb F J G Ab Kb Bb C.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
