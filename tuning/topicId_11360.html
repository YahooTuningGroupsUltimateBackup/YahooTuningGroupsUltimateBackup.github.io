Darren was going to work with CSOUND, and Paul was perhaps<br/>making some .wav files.  Eventually, these files will be posted with<br/>some of the other ones I did in the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> &quot;Tuning Lab.&quot;  The details<br/>for the experiment were given by me in a post on TD 719.  Is this still<br/>&quot;on the burner&quot; or did people get too busy to do it?...  Maybe too much<br/>MOS to munch on??</p><p>____________ ______ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=11408 href="#11408">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2000 6:26:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Where are the files?

I only wish I had more free time to persue<br/>every interesting issue mentioned here.</p><p>Wrt to the upcoming tuning experiment, I caution you to<br/>find some way to isolate successive chords from each other.<br/>(Who knows, root succession might have some effects (-:  .<br/>I think that this is the reason that several subjects confused major<br/>with minor chords in the old experiments by Heinlein and by Henver.)</p><p>You can count me, too among those who perceive a strong difference<br/>between the otonal and the utonal versions of V7. (&quot;Otonal&quot; means<br/>overtones of a fundamantal bass, like 4:5:6:7, meantone C-E-G-A#;<br/>&quot;utonal&quot; means the inverse, tones with a common overtone, like<br/>1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5, meantone G#-C-D#-F#.)</p><p>I have asked several people whether they perceive the difference;<br/>they almost invariably say that the difference is great. I have<br/>also asked several people to fine-tune by ear a V7 (the 5th being<br/>fixed, varying the two other tones). They reach either the one<br/>or the other of the above tunings, the first one more often;<br/>their own results surprise them.</p><p>At one time I asked two friends to try this tuning exercise;<br/>each reached a different tuning, then they became agitated with each<br/>other, saying that he surely is &quot;tone deaf&quot; if he cannot perceive the<br/>correctness of the other&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Suppose that we agree that there is some significance in the<br/>dualistic analysis (o-/u-tonality) of the V7-like chords. The<br/>question arises whether it is important that the root of G#-C-D#-F#<br/>is then A# (the lowest common overtone). We would also want to<br/>determine to what degree root progressions are significant, also<br/>in comparison to the effect of inter-chordal intervalic relations.<br/>In an attempt to address these questions I have set up some choice<br/>tests with chord progressions.
