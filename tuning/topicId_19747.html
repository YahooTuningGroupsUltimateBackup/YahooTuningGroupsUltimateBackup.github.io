In<br/>the Psalm-tones, the notes of termination may also differ, so that<br/>keyboard settings in the Third Tone often conclude on A, and in the<br/>Fourth Tone on E.</p><p>Again, practice is flexible: thus while the confinal for Mode I<br/>(authentic D Dorian) is A, and that for Mode 2 (plagal D Dorian) is F,<br/>internal cadences on both F and A might often occur in a piece set in<br/>Mode I, for example.</p><p>As happens, the Fourth Mode is one of my favorites, maybe my favorite<br/>of them all for this kind of music, and Spanish and Portuguese<br/>composers certainly make the most of it. The descending cadential<br/>semitone to the final F-E (or Bb-A in the most common transposition<br/>using Bb) gives the mode its special quality.</p><p>The English expression &quot;to set the tone&quot; may derive from this sense of<br/>_Tonus_ as a musical mode, and in fact some keyboard pieces in a<br/>16th-17th century liturgical setting serve precisely to introduce the<br/>mode for some vocal piece.</p><p>Here I say &quot;overwhelmingly likely&quot; because someone just might come up<br/>with an example somewhere where someone in this era does refer to<br/>quartertones in such a manner, but I&apos;m not aware of such a usage. The<br/>French composer Anthoine de Bertrand, who uses Vicentino-like dieses<br/>in one of his French settings, does refer to these _dieses<br/>enarmoniques_ in the French introduction to his collection of 1578 as<br/>altering a note by a _cart de ton_, so the idea of a &quot;quartertone&quot; is<br/>not itself totally alien to the period, although &quot;fifthtone&quot; seems to<br/>me more common as well as precise if we assume a tuning like<br/>Vicentino&apos;s.</p><p>For sources of fifthtone music from this era, one starting point might<br/>be my list of references from October of 1999; I give links for all<br/>four archicembalo postings in another message I&apos;m about to send, but<br/>maybe a redundant link (like a redundant key on some generalized or<br/>regularized keyboards) is more user-friendly than otherwise:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_5670.html#5670">/tuning/topicId_5670.html#5670</a> (Pt. 4 -- notes)</p><p>Unfortunately, apart from Bertrand&apos;s chanson _Ie suis tellement<br/>amoureux_, the main sources of which I&apos;m aware are the treatises of<br/>Vicentino (1555) and Colonna (1618), both available in full, as I note<br/>in my references. Also, there&apos;s a Portuguese keyboard piece discussed<br/>and transcribed by Hoyle Carpenter, &quot;Microtones in a Sixteenth Century<br/>Portuguese Manuscript,&quot; a journal article for which I am indebted to<br/>Johnny Reinhard of the American Festival of Microtonal Music. I can<br/>try to track down this reference, unless you have at hand, Johnny.</p><p>This keyboard piece has a style in some ways like that of Colonna,<br/>including the use of fifths or fourths impure by a diesis, and is in<br/>the Phrygian mode -- the final cadence maybe suggesting to me the<br/>Fourth Tone.</p><p>For direct chromaticism and various forms of adventurous accidentalism<br/>not involving direct fifthtones, there are lots and lots of sources: I<br/>recall that Trabaci published a volume specifically for chromatic<br/>harpsichords or _cembali chromatici_ with 19 notes per octave, and<br/>that this may be reflected in the title of the collection.</p><p>Glenn Watkins discusses various contemporaries and followers of<br/>Gesualdo, and maybe more of this music is available in modern editions<br/>now than when he wrote some 25 years back.</p><p>One question I can answer: Gesualdo does indeed use direct melodic<br/>leaps of diminished fourths, with Watkins providing an example,<br/>_Gesualdo: The Man and His Music_, p. 200, ex. 53(c) from _Mille volte<br/>il di_ (Book VI). Giaches de Wert and Claudio Monteverdi also do it,<br/>the latter drawing criticism from the theorist Giovanni Battista<br/>Artusi in his dialogue on _The Imperfections of Modern Music_ (1600),<br/>although Artusi generally praises Wert for his style.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
