While Aristoxenus&apos;s<br/>mathematics inevitably imply ultimately 144-ET and<br/>all its subdivisions (see the Archives for my postings<br/>on 144-ET), that&apos;s not quite what he was describing.</p><p>Aristoxenus grew up in Tarantum, where Archytas had<br/>lived, and he presumably had a good knowledge of rational<br/>music-theories as propounded by the Pythagoreans, and their<br/>empirical modifications by Archytas, in addition to the<br/>non-rational theories described by the Harmonists, whom<br/>he criticizes (as far as their use of _katapyknosis_)<br/>while saying that there is some merit in their work.</p><p>Aristoxenus lived during a time of exciting changes in<br/>Greek music and mathematics.  More strings had been added<br/>to the lyre, the chromatic genus took its place alongside<br/>the ancient enharmonic (&apos;quarter-tone&apos;) and diatonic,<br/>and all three genera blossomed with many different &apos;shades&apos;<br/>and subdivisions.  It was also around this time that Euclid<br/>wrote his _Geometry_, which is the method of explaination<br/>invoked by Aristoxenus in his _Elementa Harmonia_ to describe<br/>the intervals used in musical scales.</p><p>Hardly anything exists that can actually be attributed to<br/>Aristoxenus himself, and the fragments of &apos;his&apos; book that<br/>do survive appear to be lecture-notes taken down by two<br/>separate students of his.</p><p>In the writings attributed to Aristoxenus (either<br/>directly or indirectly), he never actually describes any<br/>division of the &apos;octave&apos;, or indeed, never uses the &apos;octave&apos;<br/>as a boundary to describe any of his systems.  His basic<br/>unit was the &apos;perfect 4th&apos;, which he refused to describe<br/>as a ratio but did assume could be tuned perfectly by ear,<br/>which would pretty much equate it with the 4:3 ratio.</p><p>(Any references to the contrary would be appreciated!<br/>- meaning both further speculations on Aristoxenean theory,<br/>and modern psycho-acoustical research quantifying the<br/>&apos;perfect 4th&apos; thru experimentation as something other<br/>than 4:3.)</p><p>He then &apos;proved&apos; that this interval was divisible into<br/>&apos;2 and a half tones&apos;.  Since his method was geometrical<br/>division, this means that a &apos;tone&apos; is 2/5 of a &apos;4th&apos;,<br/>a &apos;semitone&apos; is 1/5 of a &apos;4th&apos;, and a &apos;quarter-tone&apos;<br/>(Aristoxenus defines the &apos;smallest enharmonic diesis&apos;<br/>as &apos;1/4 of a tone&apos;) is 1/10 of a &apos;4th&apos;:</p><p>Aristoxenus&apos;s &apos;tone&apos;         = (4/3)^(2/5)  = ~199.218 cents<br/>Aristoxenus&apos;s &apos;semitone&apos;     = (4/3)^(1/5)  =  ~99.609 cents.<br/>Aristoxenus&apos;s &apos;quarter-tone&apos; = (4/3)^(1/10) =  ~49.804 cents.</p><p>~199.218 + ~199.218 + ~99.609  =  ~498.045 cents<br/>(the approximate size of a 4:3 &apos;perfect 4th&apos;), which<br/>is in essence what Arixtoxenus proves.</p><p>Admittedly these figures are extremely close to 12-ET,<br/>with Aristoxenus&apos;s &apos;tone&apos; less than 4/5 of a cent smaller<br/>than 2^(2/12), and his &apos;semitone&apos; less than 2/5 of a cent<br/>smaller than 2^(1/12) [ - stemming from the fact that<br/>4:3 is only ~1.955 cents smaller than 2^(5/12) ].</p><p>But they *are* different.</p><p>On the other hand (but still contradicting Paul to an<br/>extent), Aristoxenus implicity recognizes [_Elementa<br/>Harmonia_ 1.46] the 4:3 ratio for the &apos;4th&apos;, and the &apos;tone&apos;<br/>as the difference between a &apos;5th&apos; and a &apos;4th&apos; [= (3/2) / (4/3)<br/>= 9/8], so it could also be argued that his division of a<br/>&apos;4th&apos; into &apos;two and a half tones&apos; recognizes the Pythagorean<br/>9:8 [= 3^2] &apos;tone&apos; and 256:243 [= 3^-5] &apos;semitone&apos;:<br/> (9/8)  *  (9/8)  * (256/243) =  4/3<br/>~203.91 + ~203.91 +  ~90.225  = ~498.045 cents</p><p>This would make his &apos;quarter-tones&apos; either 1/4 of the former<br/>or 1/2 of the latter:</p><p>either (9/8)^(1/4)     = ~50.978 cents<br/>or     (256/243)^(1/2) = ~45.112 cents.</p><p>(It is not inconcievable that Aristoxenus had all of these<br/>different measurements in mind, as he admitted the possibility<br/>of combining all kinds of different-sized intervals in<br/>his genera.)</p><p>In either case, it&apos;s not entirely accurate to give<br/>Aristoxenus credit for describing &apos;the division of<br/>the octave into 12, 18, or 24 aurally equal parts&apos;<br/>without further qualification.</p><p>And I didn&apos;t even go into Aristoxenus&apos;s descriptions of<br/>&apos;third-tones&apos; (his &apos;smallest chromatic diesis&apos; implying<br/>18-ET), and the &apos;unmelodic&apos; (i.e., not used as part of<br/>any genera, but only involved in comparing different genera)<br/>&apos;sixth-tones&apos; (implying 36-ET), &apos;twelfth-tones&apos; (implying<br/>72-ET), and &apos;1&amp;1/2 times the enharmonic diesis&apos; [_Elementa<br/>Harmonia_, 1.51] (which would be &apos;3/8-tones&apos;, implying 48-ET).</p><p>The equal division of an &apos;octave&apos; which contains all these<br/>divisions, and thus makes it easy to compare them all to one<br/>another in the geometrical way Aristoxenus was doing, is 144-ET.</p><p>In fact, it&apos;s not entirely clear to me why Aristoxenus<br/>so strongly criticized the use of _katapyknosis_, which<br/>appears to be a way of drawing all the scales in a graphical<br/>diagram which compares their intervals together, when he<br/>himself describes the limits of the generic ranges with<br/>an explicit allusion to &apos;1/12-tones&apos; and an implicit one<br/>to &apos;1/24-tones&apos;, whatever he actually meant by &apos;tone&apos;.</p><p>See particularly 1.23-27 of _Elementa Harmonia_, where<br/>Aristoxenus says that the moveable notes within the tetrachord<br/>can be *any* of the infinite variety of intervals within<br/>the characteristic ranges of the genera.</p><p>At 1.47 he argues emphatically for a functional interpretation<br/>of note-names wherein intervals that span various ranges<br/>can be described by the same name, qualified by their<br/>genera and shade; and argues against a naming convention<br/>which provides a different name for each interval. He<br/>says this is an impossiblity anyway, because &apos;an infinite<br/>number of names would be necessary to describe an infinite<br/>number of intervals&apos;.</p><p>What is pretty clear is that Aristoxenus didn&apos;t really mean<br/>to provide an accurate numerical measurement of any kind<br/>for his musical intervals, but rather sought to describe<br/>ranges of relative aural perception into which intervals<br/>could be categorized.</p><p>This reminds me somewhat of Dan Stearns&apos;s recent musings<br/>on Ives&apos;s tunings contra Johnny Reinhard&apos;s acceptance of<br/>Pythagorean tuning in Ives (is it ironic that Aristoxenus<br/>implies 144-ET, the tuning Dan likes for his notation?),<br/>and what Brian Ferneyhough wrote about some of his own work<br/>(forwarded to the List by Daniel Wolf recently).</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

The ideas<br/>attributed to Pythagoras amounted to a religion in Classical<br/>times, both during the 400s BC in Greece and its colonies<br/>(especially in Sicily) and during the neo-Pythagorean revival<br/>around 100 AD in the Roman Empire (which included Greece).<br/>See Burkert 1972 for a fascinating study of this.</p><p>To answer your question, I&apos;ll let the sources speak for<br/>themselves:</p><p>&gt; [Crocker 1966:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Macran [editor of an English translation of Aristoxenus<br/>&gt; put it, Aristoxenus was concerned with a system &quot;each member<br/>&gt; of which *is* essentially what it *does*&quot;.  This was a new<br/>&gt; kind of music theory, as different from Pythagorean theory<br/>&gt; as the new geometry was from Pythagorean arithmetic - and in<br/>&gt; exactly the same way.  The construction of a purely functional<br/>&gt; system in which elements were related only to each other, not<br/>&gt; to external units of measurement, was made possible by the<br/>&gt; new-found ability to deal with all types of musical intervals<br/>&gt; on the same basis without reference to number.</p><p>&gt; [Barker 1978:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenus was an innovator... His objective was to claw<br/>&gt; back the study of music from the hands of physicists,<br/>&gt; mathematicians, and mere recorders of low-level empirical<br/>&gt; fact, and to establish it as an independent science having<br/>&gt; its own laws and principles...</p><p>&gt; [Litchfield 1988:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenus was a philosopher whose basic purpose was to<br/>&gt; study all science (including but not restricted to music).<br/>&gt; He was not, however, necessarily interested in the actual<br/>&gt; phenomena of each science; rather, he was interested in the<br/>&gt; theory.<br/>&gt; ... Aristoxenus&apos;s _Harmonics_... is not primarily concerned<br/>&gt; with practical music, although this is the foundation of the<br/>&gt; study.  Aristoxenus used an empirical method for evolving and<br/>&gt; explaining his theories, but the conclusions remain abstract,<br/>&gt; ideal, and conceptual.  It is ironic that the Pythagoreans&apos;<br/>&gt; theories with the constant recourse to physical sound turn<br/>&gt; out to be more empirical than Aristoxenus&apos;s theories.<br/>&gt; His proof that a perfect fourth is made up of two-and-one-half<br/>&gt; tones cannot be based on practice.  Yet the concept is perfectly<br/>&gt; successful and tremendously advanced in its application of<br/>&gt; geometric logic to music.  His demonstration of the _loci_<br/>&gt; of the genera could not be readily performed or empirically<br/>&gt; derived.  Yet the concept is very clear and makes a fundamental<br/>&gt; advance in its observation of function over the earlier theorists.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure why Litchfield says that Aristoxenus&apos;s proof<br/>that &apos;2&amp;1/2 tones make up a perfect 4th&apos; is &apos;perfectly<br/>successful&apos;, when he himself goes to such length to show<br/>how variable the aural results are when Aristoxenus&apos;s proof<br/>is tried out in practice.  I suppose it merely underlines<br/>Litchfield&apos;s main point that Aristoxenus was not at all<br/>concerned with actual musical practice, but was attempting<br/>to ground musical science in a speculative Aristotelian<br/>philosophical foundation.</p><p>It should also be noted that Aristoxenus&apos;s &apos;treatise&apos;<br/>is the first one to systematize Greek musical scales<br/>into the &apos;Greater Perfect System&apos; and &apos;Lesser Perfect System&apos;.<br/>Pythagorean theorists had contented themselves with describing<br/>only individual scales, and the later neo-Pythagoreans<br/>(notably Nicomachus) made use of Aristoxenus&apos;s systems<br/>in their own Pythagorean descriptions.</p><p>REFERENCES<br/>----------</p><p>Crocker, Richard L.  1966. &apos;Aristoxenus and Greek Mathematics&apos;.<br/>_Aspects of Medieval and Renaissance Music: A Birthday Offering<br/>to Gustave Reese_, ed.
