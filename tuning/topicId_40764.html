You are not alone on this list. Personally I  am light years away from formal music theory, and I am constantly going through similar struggles and frustrations that you have so candidly described.<br/>On the other hand, I sometimes feel like a bumble bee who does not know that it should not fly, per aerodynamic laws. However, because the bumble bee is not aware of aerodynamics, it flies.<br/>There is no reason why you should not feel &quot;right at home&quot; with these wonderful people on this List who are willing to go out of their way to help educate pedestrians like myself. So, enjoy it.<br/>Your struggling pedestrian comrade Can Akkoc.<br/> coitmusic &lt;<a href="mailto:cwinowiecki@hotmail.com">cwinowiecki@hotmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:hello everyone!<br/>My name is chester winowiecki and I&apos;m a potter and ceramic musical<br/>instrument maker from west michigan. i&apos;m a member of the just<br/>intonation network but I admit that a lot of the 1/1 articles go<br/>right<br/>over my head.
