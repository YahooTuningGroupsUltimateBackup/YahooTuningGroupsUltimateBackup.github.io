Mozart himself had one built.</p><p>I remember a recording of the Forelle (Trout) Quintet with<br/>a Hammerfluegel. That tuning did not strike me as unusual.</p><p>I had no idea that 31-tone tuning would be used by these<br/>composers. (Imagine finding a piece by Mozart for a 31-ET<br/>mechanical glass harmonica!) I am very interested in any related info<br/>or leads for study.</p><p>I am not sure I understand the description of the instruments, yet.<br/>How are the six manuals positioned?</p><p>Best Regards,<br/>- George Kahrimanis   <a href="mailto:anakreon@hol.gr">anakreon@hol.gr</a></p></div>
