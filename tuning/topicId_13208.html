If<br/>it&apos;s not already fait accompli, would the person organizing the tape<br/>swap please email me off-list?  I&apos;m interested in contributing, but not<br/>sure if my music would be of interest.  Sorry that I did not get the<br/>full details during the original email exchange, I was a bit overwhelmed<br/>(on- and off-list) at the time.  :-)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div><h3><a id=13211 href="#13211">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
