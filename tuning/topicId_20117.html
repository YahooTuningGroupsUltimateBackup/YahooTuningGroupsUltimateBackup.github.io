If you<br/>change anything at all, it&apos;s like a red flag to the ear.  That aspect<br/>of music I enjoy...&quot;</p><p>Don&apos;t we sometimes speak of &quot;identities&quot; on the Tuning List??  It&apos;s<br/>the same basic concept, I believe.</p><p>The idea that INVERSIONS of chords are totally distinct from one<br/>another... a kind of hearing that manifested itself more and more in<br/>the 20th century... (leading toward microtonality?? maybe...<br/>&quot;Klangfarbenmelodie&quot; certainly...)</p><p>So, even if Stravinsky found &quot;solace&quot; as is stated in his<br/>autobiography, that he worked at the piano and had only 12 notes he<br/>had to worry about (!), in the sense of orchestration and chordal<br/>&quot;identity&quot; it was, of course, much more than this.</p><p>His particular orchestration as part of this process, was about as<br/>&quot;abstract&quot; and individual as anything could get....</p><p>And he even lived in LA!</p><p>________ ______ _____ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=20119 href="#20119">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2001 2:46:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe!<br/>    I have been saying this all along, inversions of chords are different animals, of course<br/>helmholtz pointed this out .<br/>    Also we do not know what Igor&apos;s piano was tuned to.</p><p>    Stravinsky had great respect and perceived the true beauty of the folk musics of other<br/>countries as well as  the lower classes of his own country , much to the horror of Rimsky and<br/>audiences alike. Bartok even more so. Partch took the next step necessary.</p><p>    Verdi and Pucinni have to be given credit for drawing upon the lower classes for their subject<br/>matter. Joyce is given credit for this in literature, but being the singer he was, you can see he<br/>took his cue from these two. We have to thank the likes of John Adams for regressing back to<br/>Aristocratic personalities as being the &quot;worthy&quot; to talk about.</p><p>    Solonen, who is the best conductor LA has had, referred to Bernard Hermann as the folk music<br/>of LA. Why not go to the thief&apos;s source and say Mussorgsky. Like it or not ( i being not) , The<br/>Germs are the folk music in LA. The Philharmonic is as close to Fritzcaraldo in their attitude of<br/>bringing Opera to the Amazon that one could imagine. That I think I&apos;ll put away my razor and reach<br/>for my spray can.</p><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; The idea that INVERSIONS of chords are totally distinct from one<br/>&gt; another... a kind of hearing that manifested itself more and more in<br/>&gt; the 20th century...
