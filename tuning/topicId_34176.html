Had I remembered<br/>&gt; I would have added appropriate qualifiers.</p><p>ok . . . upon reading my response to you again now,<br/>it seems a little harsh.  hope you didn&apos;t take it that way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; now of course i must acknowledge that the word &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; is used generically to mean *both* the &quot;augmented 4th&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; *and* the &quot;diminished 5th&quot; -- and  T H I S  is probably<br/>&gt; &gt; more likely the result of keyboard-based thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You got it! *That&apos;s* the one I was talking about. The term<br/>&gt; is handy when referring to either (or both) &quot;inversions&quot; as<br/>&gt; they function (usually as dominant in common practice) in<br/>&gt; musical contexts .</p><p>ok . . . but it seems like you were describing the 12edo tritone<br/>(with the double meaning of aug4/dim5) as something special.</p><p>i want to point out that in 12edo it&apos;s no more special than<br/>the double enharmonically-equivalent meanings of any of the<br/>other intervals.  i.e., the aug1/min2, aug2/min3, maj3/dim4<br/>and their respective complements dim8/maj7, min7/aug6, min6/aug5.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>M.

There&apos;s lots of sophisticated concord/discord theory in this<br/>era: Jacobus of Liege regards 4:6:9 as relatively concordant (two<br/>fifths forming an outer major ninth), and composers like Perotin and<br/>Machaut use it in practice in a way that could illustrate this theory.</p><p>Anyway, some of this dialogue suggests to me that we might both share<br/>certain ground regarding what I call &quot;cadential streamlining,&quot; tuning<br/>certain unstable cadential sonorities so that they are at once<br/>sonorous in their smooth effect and efficient in their directed<br/>resolutions.</p><p>Right now I&apos;m largely occupied, as George Secor mentioned, in writing<br/>an article about the &quot;17-tone well-temperament revolution&quot; we&apos;re both<br/>involved in, so maybe I should save a longer exposition of this for a<br/>bit, although I&apos;m done some articles here on neo-Gothic progressions<br/>which touch on some of the concepts. For the moment, I might mention<br/>one article inspired by a classic paper of Paul Erlich:</p><p>        <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25376">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25376</a></p><p>Mainly I want promptly and enthusiastically to thank you for your<br/>friendly response, and look forward to more dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
