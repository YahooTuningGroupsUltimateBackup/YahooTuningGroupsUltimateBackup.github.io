Perhaps you could just do the luthier work for Sethares -- that<br/>is removing old frets, planing down the neck, etc.  Or even you could put<br/>the whole system together for those of us who do not want to get our hands<br/>dirty.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>Gainesville FL</p></div><h3>Glen Peterson &#x3C;Glen@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/1999 8:59:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Would anyone on this list like to comment on Mark Rankin interchangeable<br/>fretboards?</p><p>Are you satisfied with it?

Being flexible, the<br/>action is fully adjustable. Mine show no signs of wear after about 5 years<br/>(but I don&apos;t play a lot), and I expect them to last for decades. Considering<br/>the high quality of the materials and the lack of alternatives, I would say<br/>the prices are very fair. Mark Rankin is to be commended for providing this<br/>technology.</p><p>One could quibble that the feel of the plastic surface is not as sensual as<br/>a fine wooden fingerboard, true. And if the top plastic layer is not<br/>properly burnished down, the edges may peel a little and/or chip off, but<br/>that is avoidable by good workmanship (at least so far, in my experience)<br/>and is only cosmetic at any rate.</p><p>For heavy players, if you tend to wear out the frets on your guitars, that<br/>may be a problem here: I have no idea how hard it would be to replace frets<br/>on these fingerboards, but at the minimum you would need to get more of that<br/>special &quot;derby hat&quot; fret wire and a new top plastic layer to cover them up,<br/>which is much more hassle than pulling frets out of wood and hammering new<br/>ones in.</p><p>David Canright                <a href="mailto:DCanright@NPS.Navy.mil">DCanright@NPS.Navy.mil</a><br/>Monterey, CA  93943  USA      <a href="http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/">http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/</a></p></div><h3>John Schneider &#x3C;johnoschneider@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/1999 11:22:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi! I&apos;ve been using Tom Stone&apos;s fingerboards in concerts &amp; recordings since<br/>1978!! All versions, including the first non-magnetic ones (what a<br/>headache!)<br/>I just had a new fingerboard made from a Rankin kit just last month, and<br/>travel with about 10 at a time. The only drawback is the change in tdhe<br/>sound of the instrument, seeing that the acoustic response of the neck is<br/>severely compromised. The high frequencies are somewhat quenched by the<br/>magnetic material, and the sustain is a bit dampened - but the ease of<br/>changeability and portability far outweigh those considrations for me..<br/>I have a luthier here in Los Angeles put together the kits after I have<br/>carefully tuned the fret placement witha dummy fret and a Peterson Strobe<br/>tuner.<br/>You can hear the result on Bridge Records JUST WEST COAST from 1994.</p><p>Please let me know if you intend to market/manufacture the fingerboards, as<br/>Mark Rankin (bless his soul) is very difficult to get in touch with, in this<br/>electronic instant gratification age of ours!</p><p>john</p><p>&gt;From: &quot;Glen Peterson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Glen@OrganicDesign.org">Glen@OrganicDesign.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Reply-To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt;To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: [tuning] Re: Tom Stone<br/>&gt;Date: Wed, 27 Oct 1999 23:59:46 -0400<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Would anyone on this list like to comment on Mark Rankin interchangeable<br/>&gt;fretboards?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Are you satisfied with it?
