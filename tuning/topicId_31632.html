But there is an effect that happens<br/>when composing in fixed JI -- composing with a pitch set like<br/>1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8 rather than an interval set<br/>like 1:1, 6:5, 5:4, 3:2, 2:1.  Here, the prime limit of the<br/>_pitch set_ tends to approximate the odd-limit of the interval<br/>set, for certain types of scales at least.  I think this explains<br/>how the prime-limit thing has lasted so long.  That, a mysticism<br/>seems to be a powerful force in art (LaMonte young, for example,<br/>hardly bothers to make psychoacoustic claims for primes).</p><p>&gt;The question was - do they sound any *different*? My assumption<br/>&gt;(with which it appears that you may well disagree) was that a 1<br/>&gt;or 2 cent shift in pitch would be non-discernable (from &quot;pitch-<br/>&gt;height&quot; perspective).</p><p>I will try your particular examples.  The Justonic Pitch<br/>Palette software has a &quot;wave audio&quot; setting which is suspect<br/>is pretty accurate.

For isolated dyads, the product of numerator and denominator<br/>gives a good ranking.  For music, the odd-limit of the set of<br/>consonant dyads used gives a good ranking.  In either case, big<br/>primes are less concordant than small primes, just as big odd<br/>composite numbers are less concordant than small odd composite<br/>numbers.</p><p>&gt; Am I correct in assuming (from your statements therein) that your<br/>&gt;statement (quoted directly above) is answering in the negative only<br/>&gt;to the *first* part of the questions, which is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;Do prime numbers (when included in the numerator/denominator of<br/>&gt; rationally described scale pitches) impart a &quot;special<br/>&gt; characteristic&quot; as differentiated from non-prime numbers...?</p><p>It answers in the negative to this.  Note this isn&apos;t quite the same<br/>as my disclaimer, which is that groups of intervals of a given<br/>prime limit may share a *subtle* &apos;flavor&apos; characteristic.  In this<br/>case, composites still have the special characteristic -- they have<br/>the one of their prime factors.  I should mention that my disclaimer<br/>is purely speculative, and the scarcity of small composite numbers<br/>(only 9 and 15), as you point out, makes it hard, if not impossible,<br/>to test (because once the numbers get above 15, their discordance<br/>begins to over-power the subtler effect of my disclaimer).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2001 12:16:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do prime numbers (when included in the numerator/denominator of<br/>rationally<br/>&gt; described scale pitches) impart a &quot;special characteristic&quot; as<br/>&gt; differentiated from non-prime numbers (unique to each prime which<br/>&gt; constitutes one of the factors within the numerator/denominator of<br/>such<br/>&gt; scale pitches)?</p><p>A pitch is just a pitch, no matter what ratio, if any, is used to<br/>describe it.

At a value of 28 (if not a smaller numerical<br/>integer<br/>&gt; value than that), we have (I believe) reached values<br/>where &quot;harmonic<br/>&gt; coincidence in frequency&quot; (as a result of the large valued<br/>numerators) and<br/>&gt; the &quot;harmonic coincidence in period&quot; (as a result of the large<br/>valued<br/>&gt; denominators) become (virtually) insignificant to &quot;the ear&quot;.</p><p>True, but below that point, it&apos;s easy to fall into the trap of<br/>ascribing an acoustical significance to primeness/compositeness . . .<br/>which I hereby warn you against.</p><p>&gt; As a result of the above, (I suspect) that the &quot;special&quot;<br/>significance of<br/>&gt; &quot;primes&quot; *may* be a result of their numerical *predominance* (as a<br/>&gt; percentage of the total number of integers within such a set<br/>considered) in<br/>&gt; the area (in a given set ranging between 1 and N) of the &quot;lower-<br/>numbered&quot;<br/>&gt; integers on the real number line.

How it is that<br/>audible number relations become the medium for the deep and complex musical<br/>languages that exist in every culture is unknown and, perhaps, unknowable.<br/>Harmonic theory rightly investigates the way number is manifest in sound<br/>itself, and in what ways, if any,  these relationships are audible.</p><p>Just as prime numbers are the building blocks of the natural numbers, so are<br/>they the building blocks of sounds. In the harmonic series, even numbered<br/>partials always generate octave &quot;duplications&quot; of some lower partial. This<br/>feeling of octave equivalence seems to be universal, and a qualitative<br/>difference between even and odd partials is generally acknowledged.<br/>Nevertheless, noone can really say why octave duplication sounds to us like<br/>a projection of the same note at another level.  It is as if the ratio 2/1<br/>was in a class by itself, utterly different from all other ratios. I think<br/>it is more likely that the identity we hear in 2/1 is still present, though<br/>to a lesser degree, in 3/2 (even more so in 3/1). The identification with<br/>the fundamental lessens still further with each successive odd number<br/>introduced, while even partials always echo a quality from lower in the<br/>series.</p><p>Each partial is also itself the fundamental of its own series. For example,<br/>the ninth partial of a series is coincident with the third partial of its<br/>own third partial (3x3). This shows that the ninth partial is, on one level,<br/>redundant, because it can be derived both from the original series and as a<br/>projection of lower combined first-order and second-order partials. To my<br/>ears this results in nine being heard as a projection (and perhaps<br/>intensification -3^2) of  threeness rather than as a new quality. The<br/>seventh partial, on the other hand, cannot be produced  from lower partials<br/>upward by any method. It is &quot;new&quot; in a deeper sense than the ninth is, or<br/>the fifteenth. Nine sounds like it belongs with its parent: three. Fifteen<br/>shares a quality of sound with both its parents: five and three. Seven is,<br/>on the other hand, an original and unprecedented emanation from the source,<br/>as are 11 and 13. So primes mark the beginnings of new lineages of number<br/>relations. Once a new prime makes its appearance, it will interact with<br/>lower primes to project hybrids up into the harmonic series. As a bare<br/>measure of consonance, perhaps odd numbers tell the quantitative tale, but<br/>there is another relational dimension to musical sound in which the<br/>phenomena of  prime numbers is audibly reflected.</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2001 2:09:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;clumma&quot; &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But there is an effect that happens<br/>&gt; when composing in fixed JI -- composing with a pitch set like<br/>&gt; 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8 rather than an interval set<br/>&gt; like 1:1, 6:5, 5:4, 3:2, 2:1.

I think 19 is about the limit and even that&apos;s a bit of a<br/>stretch, perhaps. I think it is difficult to define a precise cutoff<br/>point, since it is a fading continuum, but the fade is rapid enough<br/>to at least specify a range somewhere in the teens, I would say.<br/>Certainly up through 13. 17 and 19 get a little fuzzy and then it&apos;s a<br/>lost cause in my opinion, due to tuning proximity to nearly identical<br/>intervals with different prime factors.</p><p>I do hear a subtle qualitative difference in the just 5:6 and 16:19,<br/>and certainly the qualitative shift is far less subtle when either is<br/>compared with 6:7. But 5:9 and 9:16 also differ qualitatively to my<br/>ear, even though they do not partake of the same qualities as other<br/>intervals containing the same primes, as one might think if too<br/>deeply devoted to the prime theorists&apos; conjectures.</p><p>My hypothesis of the moment, based strictly on personal subjective<br/>experience, is that lower primes have some weight in determining the<br/>subjective color or tonal quality of an interval. It seems to me that<br/>there is at least some merit in the association of lower primes with<br/>quality, and that simple pitch span is not enough.</p><p>I base this on the observation of the drastically different<br/>subjective color I personally perceive between 6:7 and 5:6, for<br/>example, and I&apos;m speaking melodically as well as harmonically,<br/>although I personally find the harmonic situation even more<br/>contrasting and it is hard to know without some very good research<br/>how much of the melodic perception is preconditioned by previous<br/>harmonic experience.</p><p>I will also allow for the possibility that subjective<br/>intervalic &quot;color&quot; could be explained in terms of pitch span taken as<br/>a kind of psychoacoustic spectrum analagous to visual color. This<br/>possibility is admittedly reinforced by the tuning proximity<br/>phenomenon erasing qualitative differences. However, as some have<br/>pointed out already, there is a certain &quot;7-ness&quot; common to several<br/>intervals that contain it as a prime factor.</p><p>On the other hand, Gene&apos;s excellent question, &quot;Does 9/7 have 3-ness,<br/>7-ness, 9-ness, or more than one of the above?&quot;, does make one think<br/>about even that. To me it has &quot;7-ness&quot; as was previously proposed,<br/>possibly because the implied fundamental is the same as for 6:7 or<br/>5:7. I would conjecture that intoducing 7 as prime into harmony lends<br/>a distinctive new flavor that tends to dominate. This leads to a<br/>possible hypothesis that until we reach the upper limit imposed by<br/>problems with tuning resolution, the higher primes dominate the<br/>flavor. When I hear an open octave and perfect fifth without the<br/>major third, I hear &quot;3-ness&quot;. When the triad is filled in with the<br/>M3, I hear &quot;5-ness&quot; dominating.</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 11:22:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My take on this:  of course it depends on tonal context, so that<br/>&gt; in an otonal context, I would say that 9/7 has a composite 3-ness,<br/>&gt; (those who hold that oddness has validity over primeness would<br/>&gt; say that it has a 9-ness), and in a utonal context, it has a 7-ness.</p><p>Can you elaborate on why you&apos;d feel this way?

Play a 1:7:9 chord first,<br/>&gt;&gt; only briefly, and I&apos;d say 7:9 has a 7-ness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s cheating. Playing a 1:7:9 chord brings 1:7 into the<br/>&gt; picture.  We&apos;re talking intervals out of context here.</p><p>Okay, fair enough.  So just say I don&apos;t hear a -ness for 7:9.<br/>I&apos;m not claiming I hear nesses for all intervals.  In fact,<br/>it&apos;s that I hear them for so few intervals that&apos;s the problem.<br/>I don&apos;t have a big enough sample space to even choose a rule<br/>explaining them.

This implies directly that their<br/>pitch resolution is low enough to make even the lower integers fall<br/>into the category of those affected by the tuning proximities that<br/>obliterate the flavor differences of the higher primes (or integers)<br/>as we previously discussed. So where the line between flavors blurs<br/>as we move to higher integers is clearly a function of individual<br/>ability to discriminate pitch finely.</p><p>What calculation would you propose for an implied fundamental?</p><p>Paul earlier:<br/>&gt; Well, I would agree that the &quot;nurture&quot; was itself guided and<br/>informed<br/>&gt; by &quot;nature&quot;, so perhaps unavoidable.

However, we run into something of a<br/>philosophical conundrum on the nature vs. nurture issue, since, as<br/>you indicate, nature does indeed always and inevitably guide and<br/>inform nurture. I believe we too often underestimate the degree to<br/>which this is so. Maybe we should ask how sigificant is the issue in<br/>the first place, if the degree to which nature preconditions nurture<br/>in a particular case nearly mandates a particular outcome.</p><p>Then there are those cases, such as the one in our discussion, that<br/>are dependent on factors such as the individual development of pitch<br/>discrimination, especially in the context of perceiving harmonic<br/>relationships. Nurture is powerfully involved in the development of<br/>this faculty, yet both the process and the outcome are preconditioned<br/>by a plethora of natural structures, both acoustic and<br/>psychoacoustic.</p><p>Since the resulting skill in discrimating pitch is highly prized by<br/>the most discriminating audiences, I don&apos;t think we should<br/>necessarily allow ourselves to be guided by the lowest common<br/>denominator or simply write off the whole thing as purely subjective<br/>and arbitrary because of the range of perceptual acuity that exists<br/>among consumers of music.</p><p>I get the impression sometimes (not a reference to anything you&apos;ve<br/>said, Paul) that people who heavily push the nurture side of the<br/>equation are using that to argue that the whole thing is arbitrary<br/>and strictly a matter of personal preference, failing to allow that<br/>there could be natural principles that are indeed universals and not<br/>strictly products of some kind of cultural relativism.

I simply was<br/>comparing three minor thirds, so naturally the bottom pitch of the<br/>ration was held constant while listening for the differnt minor third<br/>qualities above it. Somewhat arbitrary, but it seems more intuitive<br/>and simple to compare that way to me.</p><p>Bob earlier:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The pitch spans are not so terribly different between 16:19<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5:6,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differing by only about 17 cents if I remember correctly,<br/>which<br/>&gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nevertheless enough to make a significant change (a diatonic<br/>&gt; half-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step at 112 cents)in the implied fundamental with very<br/>&gt; different<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harmonic implications.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you get a diatonic half-step? I get a major third.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; &gt; Convert to 80:95 and 80:96 and the implied fundamentals can be<br/>seen<br/>&gt; &gt; as having a 15:16 ratio. This is born out by my hearing, to boot.<br/>&gt; If<br/>&gt; &gt; we put the lower value as C, I can clearly hear the Ab in the<br/>first<br/>&gt; &gt; case and the G in the other. They&apos;re harmonically completely<br/>&gt; &gt; different animals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob, the implied fundamental of a 16:19 C-Eb would be C, not G.<br/>What<br/>&gt; overtones would this C and Eb be over a G fundamental??<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>Sorry! Of course. I was confusing myself with the difference tone at<br/>G, which I can easily hear, but which is not the fundamental. I was<br/>letting clear experience cloud my analysis, not thinking beyond it.<br/>My apologies. I should make it clear that I&apos;m not necessarily trying<br/>to promote a particular view, even when I may be admittedly a bit<br/>attached to it, but wishing to subject hypotheses to rigorous<br/>analysis.</p><p>Bob ealier:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we should ask how sigificant is the issue in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first place, if the degree to which nature preconditions<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; nurture<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a particular case nearly mandates a particular outcome.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t. There are plenty of other ways in which humans have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; decided to create music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob replied:<br/>&gt; &gt; I meant that to apply in context to the cases in which it does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How conveeeeenient :)<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>Well, I&apos;m not trying to win anything. I simply was referring to a<br/>concession you had made earlier to a particular point and applying it<br/>to that case and whatever others might fall in the same category.</p><p>Bob had continued:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; quoting from you here, when you stated that nature guides and<br/>&gt; informs<br/>&gt; &gt; the nurture for the case in point in our previous post.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Besides, how can any experience, and by implication nurturing,<br/>not<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; guided and informed by nature, since our very perceptions are<br/>&gt; &gt; conditioned by the structure of our perceptual apparatus and<br/>their<br/>&gt; &gt; neurological processing in the associated aspects of the nervous<br/>&gt; &gt; system and brain, not to mention all the natural laws that govern<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; nature and behavior of the objects perceived?<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul:<br/>&gt; Well, I would argue that the neurological processes involved in<br/>&gt; listening to and learning music are often the same ones involved in<br/>&gt; listening to and learning language. In that regard, musical systems<br/>&gt; can be expected to diverge and become mutually unintelligible much<br/>&gt; the way languages do. That&apos;s really the kind of point the &quot;nurture&quot;<br/>&gt; tack is trying to make, regardless of whether one views all of this<br/>&gt; as a &quot;natural&quot; process.</p><p>Bob now:<br/>Well, me thinks it&apos;s quite a stretch to say that different musical<br/>idioms are as difficult to access and begin to comprehend as<br/>unfamiliar spoken languages.

Nevertheless, the ease with which I adapt<br/>to exotic musical idioms as opposed to the acquisition of an<br/>unfamiliar language defies any serious comparison, even though I&apos;m<br/>unusually quick in acquiring new spoken languages. How much less<br/>comparison is there for those musicians, of whom I&apos;ve known quite a<br/>few, whose linguistic acumen outside of music is quite limited, even<br/>in their own language?</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2001 12:38:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;BobWendell@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Bob now:<br/>&gt; If the higher prime or integer dominates as hypopthesized, then it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t matter whether it&apos;s the upper or lower one.

From what I understand, they really do think<br/>of the 9/8 example I gave as sssL (2 2 2 3).</p><p>In some ways the Indian orientation is more top down. I don&apos;t have my<br/>notes with me here, but the day of study I had with a Tabla master<br/>showed some of the tradition of tabla composition and it really did<br/>start from the macro-form (in this case 128 beats) and work its way<br/>down. When it got to the bottom level, it looked in Western terms<br/>like a very complicated set of barlines repeating strange amounts<br/>of times. (The inner sub-divisions in Indian music are usually just<br/>duple, HOWEVER, it is very common to play something &quot;two times at<br/>twice as fast&quot; or &quot;three times at three times as fast&quot; or &quot;two<br/>and a half times at twoa and a half times as fast&quot;).</p><p>If I can make a point that is relevant here, it is that there are<br/>many different ways of thinking of rhythm, even if they all seem<br/>to end up dealing with &quot;small numbers&quot;.</p><p>Considering that the Western tradition managed to boil all of<br/>music down to &quot;major minor march and waltz&quot; it is a real uphill<br/>climb to learn about musics (or try to discover an inner music)<br/>that managed not to fall into these local minima.</p><p>&gt; I feel that there is no reason to assume out of hand that there is<br/>&gt; not a similar differentiation that is natural to pitch perception.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not pretending to prove anything with these arguments, but I<br/>&gt; think it is a point worth bearing in mind before we eliminate this<br/>&gt; line of thinking out of hand.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Something that came out of this thread<br/>somewhere that a 3-limit music will naturally explore the<br/>realm of 9, 27, etc... a 5-limit music will naturally bump<br/>into 15, 9/5 etc, just as a matter of continueing what it<br/>does naturally. I do tend to think that, at least for musicians,<br/>there is something about this referentiality that does become<br/>familiar. For instance, I do think 9/8 has a feeling of<br/>stability that 8/7 doesn&apos;t. I think 16/9 also has a greater<br/>stability than 9/5.

This, I believe,<br/>&gt; goes much of the way toward explaining what good &quot;swing&quot; is all<br/>&gt; about.</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>I think, as you may have alluded to, in jazz there is often a lock,<br/>at least by the rhythm section, on a certain definition of the eighth<br/>note. It may be arrived at in a pretty dynamic manner though. Once I<br/>played bass (guitar) on a jazz gig and the drummer had me &apos;push&apos; the<br/>quarters while he held them back. It was tiring work for me but the<br/>combined tension &apos;locked&apos; in a &quot;laid back but propelled&quot; i.e., swinging<br/>manner.</p><p>What I was more thinking about was what many would refer to as less<br/>sophisticated players. I mentioned Bahia Black but field recordings<br/>of Yoruba and derivative religions (Santeria, Voudou) will have a<br/>lot of simultaneous dotted_eighth+sixteenth on one player and triplet<br/>feel in another player. On a micro-level, there is this greater<br/>amount of syncopation happenning in all the little &quot;flammy&quot; things<br/>between instruments. What I tend to think also happens is that<br/>players are pulled (tempered) towards a mid-point. Now we&apos;re back<br/>in the realm of the swing eighth.</p><p>For those interested in playing fun rhythms, there is a metronome<br/>called &apos;mundobeat&apos; which is cheaper than the Dr Beat and other<br/>polyrhythm supporting metronomes and also is more capable. As an<br/>example of this rhythmic tempering thing, I programmed it with<br/>a very fast five, basically just</p><p>    low_dotted_quarter  high_eighth</p><p>so this is just a 3+2 pattern. (fast means that it goes at about<br/>60 bars per minute, or the eighth = 300).</p><p>I had played this tune with a drummer and had noticed that we<br/>sometimes slipped into six, with the barlines remaining constant.<br/>I tried improvising with the metronome and the same phenomena<br/>occurred.  On the one hand I can try to fight it since expressing<br/>the song should be more in the realm of &apos;fiveness&apos;. On the other<br/>hand, the fast five-over-six has a tension that is a cool thing<br/>on its own. Basically the metronome feels like a slightly<br/>egg-shaped version of the six.</p><p>&lt;good stuff regarding 12-tet refernces skipped&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, some forms of 7 and 15 can be thought of &quot;8 with a<br/>&gt; &gt; beat missing&quot; or &quot;16 with a beat missing&quot;. 9 and 17 are<br/>&gt; &gt; similar &quot;added beats&quot; to familiar forms (is the analogy<br/>&gt; &gt; to tuning that sometimes a 7/6 is an extremely bruised minor<br/>&gt; &gt; third???).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 9/8 and 17/16 would have to be considered extremely bruised<br/>&gt; unisons.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Analogys between rhythmn and harmony do get stretched pretty<br/>easily. I don&apos;t know where the exact point is that a bruised<br/>unison occurs (we&apos;ve conjectured about the pocket being +- 20c<br/>which is suspiciously close to 81/80). On the other hand,<br/>slowed down enough to hear 81 over 80 metrically, you would<br/>hear all sorts of &quot;phase unisons&quot; instead. First it would<br/>sound like simultaneous quarters, later like quarters<br/>displaced by sixteenth, then by tripletized quarter, then<br/>by eighth etc.</p><p>The thing I&apos;m pointing out with the egg shaped six on the<br/>metronome and this example is that some sort of rounding<br/>(temperring) takes place in rhythm too. One reason why<br/>analogys break down is that rhythm takes place in a<br/>linear domain and intervals take place in a log domain.<br/>Another thing is that phase relations are very important<br/>in rhythm and practically ignorable in harmony.</p><p>Good holidays to you Paul.</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2001 2:52:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Bob,</p><p>&gt; From: robert_wendell &lt;<a href="mailto:BobWendell@technet-inc.com">BobWendell@technet-inc.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, December 24, 2001 1:19 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Prime Rarity?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back on the original theme of this thread, and to possibly reopen and<br/>&gt; big can of worms, I wish to elaborate a point Joe Monz made earlier.<br/>&gt; It intuitively resonates very strongly with me, if you will allow for<br/>&gt; that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I notice that rhythmically, patterns of two and three beats grouped<br/>&gt; together by emphasis and/or meter create a different intuitive<br/>&gt; feeling or sense of rhythmic flavor in the listener.

A 9/8 meter has no &quot;twoness&quot;, but is<br/>&gt; pure &quot;threeness&quot;.</p><p>Umm... well, not necessarily.  Are you familiar with Dave Brubeck&apos;s<br/>great tune &quot;Blue Rondo a la Turk&quot;?  It&apos;s in 9/8 meter, but divided<br/>2 + 2 + 2 + 3.  OK, I can still see this pattern as exhibiting<br/>lots of &quot;threeness&quot;, but it definitely also contains &quot;twoness&quot;<br/>along with the &quot;threeness&quot;, so it&apos;s quite different from the<br/>&quot;pure threeness&quot; of 3 + 3 + 3, which is what I think you were<br/>referring to.</p><p>&gt; Even in 6/8 meter, to me there is a subjective<br/>&gt; domination of &quot;threeness&quot; inspite of its being at a lower stratum<br/>&gt; rhythmically. On the other hand, note that in 3/4 time, where the<br/>&gt; next lower strata are grouped by 2s, the dominant flavor is<br/>&gt; still &quot;threeness&quot;.</p><p>Do you know about the metrical device called &quot;hemiola&quot;<br/>(Greek for 3:2).  It&apos;s a simultaneous combination of 6/8<br/>and 3/4, wherein both meters exhibit both &quot;threeness&quot; and<br/>&quot;twoness&quot;, but each in opposite &quot;strata&quot;.</p><p>&gt; One of the things that differentiates jazz and related musics&apos;<br/>&gt; rhythmic structure from traditional European meters and rhythmic<br/>&gt; style is the &quot;swing&quot; feel, which comes largely from lots<br/>&gt; of &quot;threeness&quot; at the lower rhythmic strata, whereas European styles<br/>&gt; in three always seem to revert to &quot;twoness&quot; at the lowest strata.<br/>&gt; There are, of course, other subtler manipulations of rhythmic<br/>&gt; structure that characterize jazz and related styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Indian systems and some of the more experimental western styles,<br/>&gt; there are groupings of five and more in rhythmic stuctures. I feel<br/>&gt; that five definitely takes a dominant role in giving flavor to those<br/>&gt; rhythms that it characterizes.</p><p>Just thought I&apos;d mention that much of Partch&apos;s music has good examples of<br/>complex meters containing 5 in different strata.</p><p>&gt; But like pitch, when going to the higher primes in these groupings,<br/>&gt; the mind does tend to simplify, and break these groupings down,<br/>&gt; excepting only the most experienced and sophisticated listeners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel that there is no reason to assume out of hand that there is<br/>&gt; not a similar differentiation that is natural to pitch perception.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not pretending to prove anything with these arguments, but I<br/>&gt; think it is a point worth bearing in mind before we eliminate this<br/>&gt; line of thinking out of hand.</p><p>Ah, now I think you&apos;re really onto something here, because I see an<br/>interesting parallel!

A 9/8 meter has no &quot;twoness&quot;, but is<br/>&gt; &gt; pure &quot;threeness&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Umm... well, not necessarily.  Are you familiar with Dave Brubeck&apos;s<br/>&gt; great tune &quot;Blue Rondo a la Turk&quot;?  It&apos;s in 9/8 meter, but divided<br/>&gt; 2 + 2 + 2 + 3.  OK, I can still see this pattern as exhibiting<br/>&gt; lots of &quot;threeness&quot;, but it definitely also contains &quot;twoness&quot;<br/>&gt; along with the &quot;threeness&quot;, so it&apos;s quite different from the<br/>&gt; &quot;pure threeness&quot; of 3 + 3 + 3, which is what I think you were<br/>&gt; referring to.<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>I was indeed referring only to 3 groups of 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Even in 6/8 meter, to me there is a subjective<br/>&gt; &gt; domination of &quot;threeness&quot; inspite of its being at a lower stratum<br/>&gt; &gt; rhythmically. On the other hand, note that in 3/4 time, where the<br/>&gt; &gt; next lower strata are grouped by 2s, the dominant flavor is<br/>&gt; &gt; still &quot;threeness&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you know about the metrical device called &quot;hemiola&quot;<br/>&gt; (Greek for 3:2).  It&apos;s a simultaneous combination of 6/8<br/>&gt; and 3/4, wherein both meters exhibit both &quot;threeness&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;twoness&quot;, but each in opposite &quot;strata&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>Of course. Hemiola is very characteristic of a lot of early and<br/>middle baroque style, with which I&apos;m intimately familiar from a<br/>performance perspective.</p><p>&gt; &gt; One of the things that differentiates jazz and related musics&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; rhythmic structure from traditional European meters and rhythmic<br/>&gt; &gt; style is the &quot;swing&quot; feel, which comes largely from lots<br/>&gt; &gt; of &quot;threeness&quot; at the lower rhythmic strata, whereas European<br/>styles<br/>&gt; &gt; in three always seem to revert to &quot;twoness&quot; at the lowest strata.<br/>&gt; &gt; There are, of course, other subtler manipulations of rhythmic<br/>&gt; &gt; structure that characterize jazz and related styles.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In Indian systems and some of the more experimental western<br/>styles,<br/>&gt; &gt; there are groupings of five and more in rhythmic stuctures. I<br/>feel<br/>&gt; &gt; that five definitely takes a dominant role in giving flavor to<br/>those<br/>&gt; &gt; rhythms that it characterizes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just thought I&apos;d mention that much of Partch&apos;s music has good<br/>examples of<br/>&gt; complex meters containing 5 in different strata.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But like pitch, when going to the higher primes in these<br/>groupings,<br/>&gt; &gt; the mind does tend to simplify, and break these groupings down,<br/>&gt; &gt; excepting only the most experienced and sophisticated listeners.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I feel that there is no reason to assume out of hand that there<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; not a similar differentiation that is natural to pitch<br/>perception.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not pretending to prove anything with these arguments, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it is a point worth bearing in mind before we eliminate<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; line of thinking out of hand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, now I think you&apos;re really onto something here, because I see an<br/>&gt; interesting parallel!  Just as listeners hypothetically break down<br/>&gt; a 5-meter into a 2- and a 3-, perhaps the brain strives to<br/>comprehend<br/>&gt; audible 5-limit relationships in terms of 3-limit ones, i.e., the<br/>&gt; way of understanding meantones as chains of a generator resembling<br/>&gt; the 3:2 unit-size of the 3-limit chain.  Hmmm...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; love / peace / harmony ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>Thanks, Joe! I want to reiterate to everyone participating in this<br/>thread that I see &quot;threeness&quot; at lower rhythmic strata as ONE of the<br/>important contributors to what we percieve as &quot;swing&quot; rhythm. If you<br/>red my original comments duplicated above, you will see this clearly<br/>stated. If you listen to a lot of black gospel, for instance, you<br/>will find the &quot;threeness&quot; at lower strata clearly manifest in<br/>undiluted fashion!</p><p>I love polyrhythmic African music, by the way. Sends to me to<br/>paradise. Can&apos;t get enough! It&apos;s very subtle, powerful stuff! I also<br/>savor the wonderful shifting ambiguity in the way beats are grouped<br/>such as the way &quot;threeness&quot; dissolves into &quot;twoness&quot; and back in<br/>patterns of six, much like hemiola, but infinitely more<br/>sophisticated, and not limited to two and three, but also applied to<br/>higher numbers.</p><p>There is also the &quot;bending&quot;, not of tempo, but of rhythms against the<br/>backdrop of tempo, their relationship to the steady underlying tempo,<br/>such as &quot;pushing&quot; and &quot;lagging&quot;. These phenomena are why I said<br/>the &quot;threeness&quot; at lower strata are ONE of the major contributors to<br/>the swing feel, since I understand DEEPLY that this would be VASTLY<br/>overstated and oversimplified otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>But none of these phenomena are directly applicable to frequency,<br/>since we cannot &quot;micromanage&quot; individual cycles of frequency in this<br/>way. Might not the way 3 and 2 cycles define each other when they are<br/>in exact ratio in a perfect P5 to set the &quot;meter&quot; for our perceptual<br/>apparatus in a way that would give it a distinctly different<br/>subjective flavor from other ratios?

I feel that<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; is not so different in principle from what happens in frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; relationships among musical tones. The mechanics and subjective<br/>&gt; &gt; nature of the perception of rhythm and pitch, although quite<br/>&gt; &gt; different, may have important parallels in terms of perceptual<br/>&gt; flavor<br/>&gt; &gt; and classification.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If we follow this model, we might note that although 3s may be<br/>&gt; &gt; grouped in 2s or multiples thereof, they still maintain<br/>&gt; &gt; their &quot;threeness&quot;. A 9/8 meter has no &quot;twoness&quot;, but is<br/>&gt; &gt; pure &quot;threeness&quot;. Even in 6/8 meter, to me there is a subjective<br/>&gt; &gt; domination of &quot;threeness&quot; inspite of its being at a lower stratum<br/>&gt; &gt; rhythmically. On the other hand, note that in 3/4 time, where the<br/>&gt; &gt; next lower strata are grouped by 2s, the dominant flavor is<br/>&gt; &gt; still &quot;threeness&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One of the things that differentiates jazz and related musics&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; rhythmic structure from traditional European meters and rhythmic<br/>&gt; &gt; style is the &quot;swing&quot; feel, which comes largely from lots<br/>&gt; &gt; of &quot;threeness&quot; at the lower rhythmic strata, whereas European<br/>&gt; styles<br/>&gt; &gt; in three always seem to revert to &quot;twoness&quot; at the lowest strata.<br/>&gt; &gt; There are, of course, other subtler manipulations of rhythmic<br/>&gt; &gt; structure that characterize jazz and related styles.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In Indian systems and some of the more experimental western<br/>styles,<br/>&gt; &gt; there are groupings of five and more in rhythmic stuctures. I<br/>feel<br/>&gt; &gt; that five definitely takes a dominant role in giving flavor to<br/>&gt; those<br/>&gt; &gt; rhythms that it characterizes. But like pitch, when going to the<br/>&gt; &gt; higher primes in these groupings, the mind does tend to simplify,<br/>&gt; &gt; and break these groupings down, excepting only the most<br/>experienced<br/>&gt; &gt; and sophisticated listeners.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I feel that there is no reason to assume out of hand that there<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; not a similar differentiation that is natural to pitch<br/>perception.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not pretending to prove anything with these arguments, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it is a point worth bearing in mind before we eliminate<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; line of thinking out of hand.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Bob!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, this is an interesting discussion and the integration of<br/>pitch<br/>&gt; and rhythm has been on the mind of many contemporary composers (as<br/>&gt; well as, I&apos;m sure many others throughout history...)  Of course you<br/>&gt; know this...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, it seems in order to make your analogy truly appropriate<br/>in<br/>&gt; an *historical* context, we would have to see some kind<br/>&gt; of &quot;evolution&quot; in taste from perhaps duple meter to triple meter to<br/>&gt; quintal, whatever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this an historically accurate assessment?  I&apos;m not sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The comparison, of course, would be to the &quot;evolution&quot; or at<br/>&gt; least &quot;transformation&quot; of music from 3-limit harmonies to 5-limit<br/>&gt; harmonies... maybe later 7...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, his this kind of evolution in *rhythm* really happened in<br/>music<br/>&gt; history??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bartok uses *fives* but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to clinch the<br/>&gt; argument...  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.

And if I have the audacity to generalize<br/>&gt; further, we may feel that certain raga-s are better suited to go<br/>with<br/>&gt; certain taal-s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the by, Jhaptal is:  1    2    |  1    2   3    |<br/>&gt;                         dhi  naa  |  dhi  dhi naa  |<br/>&gt; [Jhaptal is 10 beats, and so the other half of the cycle is:<br/>&gt;                         6    7    |  8    9   10   |<br/>&gt;                         ti   naa  |  dhi  dhi naa  |  ]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is my logic fallacious?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p></div><h3>clumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2002 5:43:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>31632</p><p>&gt;Here is (what should prove to be) a very interesting TEST of the<br/>&gt;*audible existence* such &quot;prime uniqueness&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(1) Setup your system to play a 1/1 and a 3/2 pitch in unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(2) Add to this dyad the following two (approximate) &quot;major 3rd&quot;<br/>&gt;pitches (one at a time).

Maybe a picture would help?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: Carl, the identities are (for unit amplitude and frequency,<br/>&gt; &gt; where w = 2*pi*f, and f = frequency, in Hz or CPS):<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; SQUARE = (4/pi)*( sin(wt)-sin(3wt)/3+sin(5wt)/5-sin(7wt)/7+.... )<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; SAWTOO = (2/pi)*( sin(wt)+sin(2wt)/2+sin(3wt)/3+sin(4wt)/4+.... )<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; TRIANGL = (8/pi^2)*( sin(wt)-sin(3wt)/(3^2)+sin(5wt)/(5^2)+.... )<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So the &quot;phase spectrum&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;magnitude spectrum&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt; of these waveforms contains harmonics which alternate in the<br/>&gt; &gt; algebraic *sign* (in the case of the SQUARE and TRIANGLE waves).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;phase difference&quot; *between* unequal frequencies is a tricky<br/>&gt; &gt; concept [since &quot;phase&quot; must be referenced to *something*, to some<br/>&gt; &gt; argument (Kwt) of one of the two (sin/cos) waves]. Such may be<br/>&gt; &gt; viewed as a &quot;phase precession&quot; (a &quot;ramping&quot; of phase) relative<br/>&gt; &gt; to the chosen reference wave.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The way to picture it (I think) is to visualize the first<br/>&gt; &gt; moments in time as an (additive) synthesis of these waves<br/>&gt; &gt; takes place. The various harmonics will initially begin to<br/>&gt; &gt; oscillate (at their respective frequencies) in either a<br/>&gt; &gt; positive or negative direction in (time domain) amplitude<br/>&gt; &gt; (relative to the &quot;fundamental&quot; frequency&apos;s trajectory,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is in a positive direction in all the examples above).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, we can be sure.
