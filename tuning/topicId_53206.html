The accidentals are in four degrees: 1 comma, 4 commas, 5<br/>commas and 8 commas.  (Note that e.g. C+1 = D-8.) You end up with 24<br/>tones that are actually used in the scale.</p><p>Here&apos;s an instrument that&apos;s fretted to facilitate this intonation:<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/293te">http://tinyurl.com/293te</a><br/>Some others have movable frets.</p><p>And here&apos;s a website with general -information on the scale:<br/><a href="http://website.lineone.net/~david.parfitt/notation.html">http://website.lineone.net/~david.parfitt/notation.html</a><br/><a href="http://website.lineone.net/~david.parfitt/turkishnotes.html">http://website.lineone.net/~david.parfitt/turkishnotes.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=53207 href="#53207">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/22/2004 2:39:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 4/22/04 3:42:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a href="mailto:heytud@yahoo.com">heytud@yahoo.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; and I&apos;m wondering if anyone here has<br/>&gt; experimented with the 53edo pythagorean approximation (from Turkish<br/>&gt; classical music) in other musical contexts?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, I use it for performances of Charles Ives.  We just finished printing<br/>Ives&apos;s &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; last night, ready for final mastering.  Live, I have<br/>used it for &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot; and &quot;String Quartet #2&quot;.  Ives gave<br/>evidence for this tuning of some of his music throughout his life.  Sharps were<br/>higher than flats and Fb was an eighthtone lower than its nearest E.  I have<br/>written a chapter on this in a book on Ives, unpublished, if you feel it<br/>important to you.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>Dirctor, American Festival of Microtonal Music, Inc.</p></div>
