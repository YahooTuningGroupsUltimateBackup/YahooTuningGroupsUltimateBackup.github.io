We are featuring<br/>a brand new piece, Chitarang, for sitar, soprano sax and horn by<br/>Pakistani composer Akmal Parwez, featuring Brian Silver, sitar, Paul<br/>Cohen, sax, and renown horn player David Jolley.  This work, an<br/>&quot;EastMeets West&quot; excursion in harmony, pertains well to<br/>hopeful aspirations for peace in world time.</p><p>Patrick Hardish ventures into jazz terrain with a new work in<br/>his &quot;Sonority&quot; series,  Jazz Sonorities.   This piece will be<br/>played by the energetic and versatile Esther Lamneck and will include<br/>an explosive part for drum set, performed by percussionist Barbara<br/><a href="http://Allen.Ms">Allen.Ms</a>. Lamneck will perform Gunther Schuller&apos;s challenging<br/>Episodesfor solo clarinet, written by that master enthusiast of the<br/>&quot;third stream&quot; genre.</p><p>We enter into the exotic realm of alternate tunings with Joseph<br/>Pehrson&apos;s Violahexy, a work for viola and electronics in an<br/>unusual Just Intonation scale performed by violist Olivia Koppell.<br/>She will also feature the dramatic Resound for viola and piano by<br/>Alison Nowak, accompanied by pianist Marc Peloquin. We also are<br/>presenting the abstract and detailed Explorations by composer Rolv<br/>Yttrehus performed by Paul Hoffmann.</p><p>Our Composers Concordance reception will follow, a nice place to meet<br/>the composers, performers and, basically, have a good time.</p><p>Tickets are $12, $7 students, seniors, TDF vouchers are accepted.<br/>For further information phone 212-564-4899.</p></div>
