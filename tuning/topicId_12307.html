Here we have the premise that as just about any tuning<br/>can be mapped to the Bosanquet (some better to Hansons). Notations of different systems could<br/>have as a commonality how they are mapped onto the keyboard. This way one could go from tuning<br/>to tuning and share an underlying logic and not have to use elaborate symbols when working<br/>with tunings with less notes.<br/>    My own experience parallels Johnny&apos;s in that given enough clues, players can zero in on<br/>any pitch. It is important that they hear what it is they are going for. Players will<br/>gravitate towards those acoustical relations (all kinds!) that are approximated by the tone in<br/>question though-hence a problem with ETs :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This experiment would be a short exercise which would be in<br/>&gt; quarter-tone notation with cents &quot;adjustments&quot; as Johnny fervently<br/>&gt; advocates and then, presuming it is in a tuning system compatible<br/>&gt; with it :), the same exercise translated to 72-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then let the player comment on which &quot;seemed&quot; more intuitive.

Of<br/>course, that&apos;s me personally...</p><p>I thought I&apos;d mention something else here about new microtonal<br/>keyboard designs.  My friend and fellow composer Brink McGoogy<br/>has a setup he built which places one regular keyboard under<br/>another, but offset about 1/3 of a key.
