I&apos;m not going to go<br/>there, except to say that in some circumstances the greater<br/>pitch discrimination provided by 144-tET, with only one<br/>extra symbol as Dan Stearns and I use it, [see TD 144.16]<br/><a href="http://www.onelist.com/messages/tuning?archive=144">http://www.onelist.com/messages/tuning?archive=144</a><br/>is useful, even if it&apos;s not consistent.</p><p>Though I think Paul is just referencing the Partch lattice Joe made in<br/>144-tET (in which case I can&apos;t exactly disagree), I will say that I<br/>came up with the 144e symbols as a *notational* aid only -- with the<br/>hope that the performer who could tame the 72 notation, as I had<br/>learned it from Joe Maneri&apos;s book (Maneri, Joseph Gabriel Esther and<br/>Scott Van Duyne, _Preliminary Studies in the Virtual Pitch Continuum_,<br/>Accentuate Music, Plainview NY, 1986) could at least approximate *and<br/>readily understand* what the crosshatch modifiers were indicating --<br/>and as such I don&apos;t think it&apos;s quite fair to rigidly hold it up to the<br/>measure of it&apos;s consistency. And as I&apos;ve tried to point out before, in<br/>at least some cases, consistency seems a much better theoretical<br/>measure than it does an actual musical one (where naturally<br/>occurring -- and often times substantial -- errors are the norm):</p><p>&quot;...if the slight altering of ETs with low consistency levels (the 14<br/>to 13.95-tET example for instance, which for all intents and purposes<br/>14-tET) result in a very different consistency measure, shouldn&apos;t that<br/>taken into account? An even better example than 14-tET - though<br/>working in the opposite direction (i.e., from a higher consistency to<br/>lower consistency), would be something like ~26.03-tET... where the<br/>largest cents deviation from 26-tET is a practically nonexistent ~1&#xFFFD;,<br/>and yet the consistency falls from an integer limit of 14 down to one<br/>of 8...&quot;</p><p>[Joe:]<br/>&gt; I really don&apos;t want to argue this point, but there are cases (my _A<br/>Noiseless Patient Spider_ was one of them)where 72-tET just doesn&apos;t<br/>provide enough accuracy to portray what&apos;s happening, and 144-tET does.<br/>Once you get used to working with it, you learn how to accomodate the<br/>inconsistencies.</p><p>Or as 72 is obviously a subset of 144, I don&apos;t see why you couldn&apos;t<br/>use the consistent mappings of 72 theoretically (for lattice<br/>representations, note naming and the like) and the crosshatch much<br/>like a quarter or eighth tone symbol in standard notation: as an<br/>indicator to get between one place and another...</p><p>[Joe:]<br/>&gt;But as a *general* rule, I&apos;ll agree that 72-tET works much better.</p><p>I think one of the best things that it has going for it is that there<br/>seems to be a pretty sizeable &apos;school of 72e&apos; up and running<br/>already... though this view/opinion may be distorted by my location,<br/>i.e., the fact that both Simms and Maneri are in the Boston area.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
