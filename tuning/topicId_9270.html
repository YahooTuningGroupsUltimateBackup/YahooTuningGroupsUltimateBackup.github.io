(I&apos;ve always been partial to the<br/>&gt;look of Voronoi diagrams.) So, the largish cell near the southwest end of<br/>&gt;the main vein would be 5:6:7 ...?</p><p>Yup!</p><p>&gt;Your limit of 64 seems a reasonable stopping point, but do you really think<br/>&gt;all those triads are really distinctly recognizable to listeners, even<br/>&gt;well-tranined ones? I would guess not.</p><p>You&apos;re right, I wouldn&apos;t. That wasn&apos;t the point though -- I gave my reasons<br/>for doing this graph a few days ago. If you&apos;ve been following the harmonic<br/>entropy discussion, the point is to let the limit go to infinity and then<br/>use the harmonic entropy function to give a dissonance measure over the<br/>plane. You end up with lower dissonance where the cells are bigger and<br/>higher dissonance where they are more crowded. You only get a few local<br/>minima at the simplest ratios -- how simple is a function of the value of<br/>sigma you assume for the central pitch processor of the listener (I usually<br/>use 1%).</p><p>&gt;If you agree, how would you reduce<br/>&gt;the number of triads to more distinguisable ones?</p><p>Again, that isn&apos;t the point, but I&apos;ve discussed (on this list with Dan<br/>Stearns) that in the dyad case, a nice answer to this problem comes out of<br/>just looking at the dyad that is given the largest probability at each point<br/>on the x-axis. So in the triad case, a nice answer to this problem comes out<br/>of just looking at the dyad that is given the largest probability at each<br/>point on the x-axis. You&apos;ll get the simple ones that correspond to local<br/>minima of the harmonic entropy, and you&apos;ll also get a similar number of<br/>slightly more complex ones, whose borders are a highly sensitive function of<br/>the input parameters.</p></div><h3><a id=9271 href="#9271">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
