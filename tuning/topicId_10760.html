Many of us have been on this list for 5 years<br/>and naturally are speaking our own language. Some, like Joseph<br/>Pehrson recently, came in understanding very little of what we were<br/>talking about, and through a bit of dedication and independent study,<br/>can now follow most of it. I would encourage you to start with an<br/>easy book like Wilkinson&apos;s _Tuning In_ or the relevant chapters of<br/>Hall&apos;s _Musical Acoustics_ until you have understood the basic ideas<br/>of harmonics, interval-ratios, just intonation, and temperament. Or<br/>you could plunge into Helmholtz&apos;s _On the Sensations of Tone_, from<br/>which you will learn all that and much more, but it might take you<br/>more time. From there, I can recommend many books and articles, many<br/>of which start from a slightly more advanced level, which would help<br/>you get &quot;up to speed&quot; on whatever aspects of tuning interest you<br/>most. I also try to be here to answer all beginner-level questions,<br/>so feel free to ask!</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=10763 href="#10763">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Alves &#x3C;ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2000 11:46:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Adam,</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t be too put off by the recent flurry of arcane math.

I know, for example, that these discussions lie<br/>behind some beautiful compositions of Kraig Grady&apos;s, and are no less<br/>important than discussions of chromatic harmony would have been to<br/>19th-century composers.

Occasionally I will make<br/>a post with useless decimal places, if Monz or Sarn or someone else<br/>specifically asks for such a thing. But by and large the math-<br/>oriented posts here do not concern math or numbers for their own<br/>sake, but an attempt to either forge musically useful structures or<br/>to gain a better understanding of how we hear music.</p><p>So even if the math-oriented material were on a separate list, we&apos;d<br/>probably come back to this list often to report our findings, involve<br/>others in listening experiments, etc. And even if our attempts at<br/>mathematical understanding are way off, and we&apos;ve deceived ourselves<br/>in our attempts to model our musical experiences with math, we&apos;ll<br/>still end up producing and inspiring some interesting music as a<br/>result (witness Dan Stearns :) :) :)).</p></div><h3><a id=10776 href="#10776">ðŸ”—</a>Arthur W.

I<br/>think the electronic instrument is a valid instrument, with its own distinct<br/>advantages and limitations like any other instrument. The concept of an<br/>instrument having flexible timbre and tuning is something which I consider<br/>too useful to ignore.</p><p>I think it might be safe to say that regardless of whether or not music is<br/>generated electronically or acoustically is equally dull when you leave the<br/>critical ear out of picture. Hence, why I think the snobbery many have<br/>regarding electronic instruments is a lot less valid than I think is often<br/>apparent.</p><p>I think because electronic instruments require a critical ear like any other<br/>instrument, I think it essential to utilize it. This is something I have<br/>seen an extraordinary lack of, particularly in the field of electronic<br/>instruments, with a few misgivings. The instrument doesn&apos;t actually make it<br/>easier for you, and isn&apos;t any more forgiving than a &quot;real&quot; instrument (if<br/>there really is such a thing). So, I completely agree with you that<br/>sometimes the ear should be shed more importance. But the electronic<br/>instrument, like any instrument, is a tool to realize many frontiers of<br/>discovery. I just think that while it may have a limitations in emulation of<br/>traditional instruments, I think the electronic instrument is too<br/>multi-faceted at this point, and I think makes up for its inherent problems<br/>at this time.</p><p>Just a thought, even if a bit off-topic from your original post.
