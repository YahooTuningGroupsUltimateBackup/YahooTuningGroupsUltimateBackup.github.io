In chamber music, in almost all cases, the score consists<br/>of one or more upper &apos;melody&apos; lines, and a continuo or thorough-bass<br/>(Ger.: General-Bass).</p><p>The difference is that the upper lines are played by solo instruments,<br/>while the continuo line is played by a bass instrument and the left<br/>hand of the accompanying keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument)<br/>in unison.</p><p>The remainder of the keyboard accompaniment is then improvised given a<br/> (usually) set harmonic structure (specified by symbols printed below<br/>the bass notes: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figured_bass">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figured_bass</a>). This<br/>improvised keyboard part may include various rhythmic and melodic<br/>elements. The point is that the keyboard in general does *not* double<br/>the solo melody lines at the unison.</p><p>I think it quite reasonable to expect that there will be a closer<br/>correspondence of tuning between the bass instrument and the left hand<br/>of the keyboard, than between any melodic solo lines and the keyboard.<br/>The bass instrument in unison with the regularly tempered keyboard is<br/>then the least intonationally flexible part of the ensemble, apart of<br/>course from the keyboard itself. It forms a predictable base from<br/>which the solo instruments can achieve more (or less) pure intervals<br/>that the keyboard can only approximate.</p><p>The extent to which a tempered or detuned unison in the bass line is<br/>acceptable (or desirable?!), without leading to unclarity, is<br/>debatable. What range of deviation does Brad think is realistic? I<br/>explicitly mentioned a 1/4 comma or 3 NU fudge factor (which could<br/>equally apply to the bass viol or to the violin), but that was only a<br/>guess.</p><p>Back to my little composition, where the bass line is<br/>C-B-C-A-E-D-G-C and the melody line is an ascending scale of C major.<br/>I will take three cases of regular keyboard temperament: 1, 2 and 3<br/>Neidhardt-unit meantone respectively, realized in 612edo &apos;skhisma&apos;<br/>units (slightly under 2 cents). 1NU meantone is essentially 12-equal;<br/>2NU is 1/6-comma; and 3NU is slightly more than 1/4-comma - more like<br/>3/11 comma.</p><p>To each note of the bass line after the initial C I add 161, 197, 415,<br/>161, 358, 197 sk, the pure thirds, fifths and sixths. The resulting<br/>violin scales are:</p><p>0 110 197 262 365 460 554 612 (1NU MT keyboard)<br/>tones: 110, 87, 103, 95, 94; semitones: 65, 58</p><p>0 105 197 259 361 458 553 612 (2NU)<br/>tones: 105, 92, 102, 97, 95; semitones: 62, 59</p><p>0 100 197 256 357 456 552 612 (3NU)<br/>tones: 100, 97, 101, 99, 96; semitones: 59, 60</p><p>For comparison, a 12-ET tone and semitone are 102 and 51, while the<br/>3NU meantone tone and diatonic semitone are 98 and 61.</p><p>The result for the 1NU tempered keyboard is striking: it is extremely<br/>awkward for the violin to play pure 5-limit intervals above the bass -<br/>even allowing for 3 or 4 units deviation, three different sizes of<br/>tone are needed (say 106, 95, 87). The two semitones might be<br/>approximated to an average one at say 61. Note that only one of the<br/>tones, and neither of the semitones, is close to those present in the<br/>keyboard. Even without any right-hand chords from the keyboard, the<br/>mere presence of its bass-line strongly disfavours pure 5-limit<br/>intonation.</p><p>But the 3NU tempered keyboard makes it child&apos;s play: all the violin&apos;s<br/>tones are within 5 units (less than half a comma) of each other, the<br/>semitones are extremely close, and their values also lie extremely<br/>close to the regular intervals already present in the keyboard. This<br/>is hardly surprising: given that all pure 5-limit intervals are<br/>present in the keyboard within a 3-unit deviation, the melody<br/>instrument needs only tiny adjustments away from regularity to obtain<br/>truly pure intervals above the bass.</p><p>The 2NU tempered keyboard case is of course halfway between the two<br/>numerically, but qualitatively it resembles 12-ET more, because the<br/>difference between different tones is still somewhat large (slightly<br/>over a comma).</p><p>The conclusion is a restatement of what you perhaps already knew from<br/>considering adaptive JI: if you start from somewhere around<br/>quarter-comma meantone then it is very easy to get chords in tune;<br/>from somewhere around 12-ET, not so. Therefore it seems obvious to use<br/>quarter-comma, unless there are other keyboard-related considerations,<br/>in particular the use of enharmonics.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=74296 href="#74296">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2007 12:24:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The remainder of the keyboard accompaniment is then improvised given a<br/>&gt;  (usually) set harmonic structure (specified by symbols printed below<br/>&gt; the bass notes: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figured_bass">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figured_bass</a>).

Of course,<br/>if you choose to go into the most adventurous and innovative composers<br/>of the late Baroque, the assumptions have to change considerably.<br/>Remarks relevant to the late Baroque are not necessarily useful or<br/>relevant to earlier (say, pre-Werckmeister) practice.</p><p>Bach&apos;s harpsichord concertos and Rameau&apos;s Pieces en Concert are<br/>clearly extremely *non*-typical, in that the harpsichord plays a<br/>leading melodic role with fully-written out right-hand lines.</p><p>If I am not mistaken, Bach even invented the genre of keyboard<br/>concerto - where the usual functions of melody and accompanying<br/>instrument (violin/keyboard resp.) are actually reversed.</p><p>Bach&apos;s harpsichord music is non-typical in the Baroque, and clearly<br/>irrelevant to my discussion, because it requires frequent enharmonics<br/>(in terms of a Halberstadt keyboard) and so is in any case not well<br/>served by regular meantone - except possibly something like 1/11-comma.</p><p>In any case, we know perfectly well that Bach was no fan of pure<br/>5-limit consonances... &apos;All the thirds sharp&apos;.

OK, let&apos;s go to Quantz.  In the several places<br/>where he writes about intonation, it is abundantly clear that he&apos;s<br/>referring to a basic system of approximately 1/6 comma 5ths, as he<br/>says repeatedly that enharmonic pairs (such as Eb and D#) are a comma<br/>apart from one another.  He even suggests that a violinist holding a<br/>tied note from G# to Ab, during an enharmonic modulation, is supposed<br/>to slide the finger a little bit to the new note during the beat.</p><p>And in his section specifically for keyboard players, he admonishes<br/>the keyboardist to pay special attention to the notes Cb, Db, Eb, G#,<br/>A#, D#, and E# when they come up for the right hand, as candidates to<br/>be omitted (or at least buried lower into the texture), since those<br/>are the ones that most readily will cause a conflict with somebody<br/>playing better in tune.  Don&apos;t stick those notes onto the top of your<br/>continuo chords; well, that&apos;s pretty normal thinking anyway, at least<br/>for me when playing in anything that&apos;s regular.  When a &quot;wrong&quot;<br/>enharmonic is being played, don&apos;t put it into an aggressively obvious<br/>place on top.  Duh.</p><p>From this, Quantz&apos;s list of problematic notes, it appears there&apos;s the<br/>expectation of a rather wide C#-G# (i.e. the G# cranked all the way<br/>up to Ab, or nearly so), and a compromised position for the Eb/D#,<br/>but otherwise a normal (1/6 comma) position for each of Bb, C#, and<br/>F#. And, if the B is raised any off its normal regular position,<br/>and/or if the F is lowered any, it&apos;s not enough to make the Cb or the<br/>E# really good...&quot;good&quot; being the satisfaction of ensemble players<br/>who are trying to hit the 1/6 comma marks for correctly-spelled<br/>notes, of course.  If Bb and F# are in normal spots, it&apos;s unlikely<br/>that the F and B would be off-spot by much, if any.</p><p>It&apos;s also possible to infer, instead of having a compromised Eb/D#,<br/>that that particular note might be retuned on the keyboard to play<br/>different compositions.  There&apos;s a different spot in the book where<br/>he advises the flautist to adjust the whole flute a little bit to<br/>play compositions in A-flat major or E-flat major.  (Near the<br/>beginning of chapter 16, &quot;What a flautist must observe if he plays in<br/>public concerts&quot;.)</p><p>If you&apos;d care to look up Quantz&apos;s remarks about the Cb, Db, Eb, G#,<br/>A#, D#, and E# for yourself, it&apos;s pages 260-261 of the Reilly<br/>translation.  According to the way he describes the typical problems,<br/>the triads to watch out for are Ab minor, Bb minor, C minor, E major,<br/>F# major, B major, and C# major.  Those are the ones where the<br/>keyboardist should consider *maybe* leaving out the third, or voicing<br/>it low in the texture.  All the other major and minor triads are<br/>presumably decent enough not to merit mention as problematic.  And,<br/>the Ab minor incident is because of a too-low Cb, not any stated<br/>problem with the 5th.  Ab major isn&apos;t cited as needing any special<br/>attention.</p><p>I defy anyone to come up with a system suiting Quantz&apos;s requirements,<br/>if the 5ths on the keyboard are any tighter than 1/6 comma.  I<br/>haven&apos;t found one yet.  And, no making up any dodgy excuses about a<br/>comma not really being a normal comma, to Quantz, when distinguishing<br/>the sharps vs flats!</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=74406 href="#74406">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/2007 9:52:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From this, Quantz&apos;s list of problematic notes, it appears there&apos;s the<br/>&gt; expectation of a rather wide C#-G# (i.e. the G# cranked all the way<br/>&gt; up to Ab, or nearly so), and a compromised position for the Eb/D#,<br/>&gt; but otherwise a normal (1/6 comma) position for each of Bb, C#, and<br/>&gt; F#.

And, I improvised<br/>around a bit through various other keys.</p><p>This convinced me to go back and lower the Eb a little bit more so it&apos;s<br/>now pure from Ab, and the Eb-Bb is a little bit wide.

Yet another evasion.) No, I don&apos;t want to give people an<br/>excuse to start hareing off into the mid- and late 1700&apos;s, I would<br/>like to think just a little about what might have been the usual<br/>intonational practice during the majority of the Baroque era, which<br/>was actually in the 17th century. But somehow the question keeps<br/>getting hijacked.</p><p>While claiming expertise on historical tunings, Brad appears totally<br/>uninterested in Baroque music before 1700 - or else, why would he<br/>deliberately ignore everything I say about it, and continually change<br/>the subject? Were there no Baroque masterpieces for instrumental<br/>ensemble before that date? Were most 17th-century musicians totally<br/>uninteresting?</p><p>I have actually read the relevant bits of Quantz, so there is no need<br/>for Brad to take such a didactic and condescending tone. I find it<br/>extremely tiresome when people write as if talking to 10-year-old<br/>children.</p><p>Quantz is certainly irrelevant to the practice of mid-Baroque music,<br/>and I don&apos;t think everything he says on intonation, with or without<br/>keyboard, can be taken to be 100 percent accurate with the<br/>mathematical certainty that Brad seems to attach to the text. (Why<br/>would he write a book that assumed one, and only one, type of regular<br/>keyboard temperament, with one, and only one, possible type of<br/>deviation from it?!)<br/>But since there are no 100-percent accurate statements about tuning in<br/>music (just as there are no 100-percent accurate rhythmic notations)<br/>this is not something one should hold against him.</p><p>However, I can&apos;t resist one quotation from Quantz (via Haynes):</p><p>&quot;... the other instruments play [notes such as Cb, D#] in their<br/>correct ratios, whereas on the harpsichord they are merely tempered.<br/>For this reason, it is better to omit them entirely [from the<br/>harpsichord], rather than offend the ear.&quot;</p><p>Now, what does this mean to you? (Anyone?)</p><p>Brad wants us to believe that &apos;correct ratios&apos; means that a major<br/>third should be about 3/12 comma sharp and a minor third about 5/12<br/>comma flat; whereas &apos;merely tempered&apos; would (according to him) mean<br/>that the thirds were somewhat more radically out of tune.</p><p>I think any sane person reading this passage would recognize a<br/>distinction between (audibly) pure and tempered intervals at face<br/>value and deduce, quite simply, that the non-keyboard instruments play<br/>(as close as practicable to) pure thirds. Which, if the player was<br/>competent, could be a lot purer than those occurring in 1/6-comma<br/>meantone. It then makes sense to omit the keyboard third if and when<br/>it is too obviously discrepant from the instrumental pitch. Quantz is<br/>not making any exact statement about keyboard temperament: he is<br/>simply saying that some thirds on the keyboard are definitely too<br/>mistuned.</p><p>His list of obviously impure keyboard thirds is clearly either not<br/>complete or inaccurate: he calls Cb&apos;&apos;, Db&apos;&apos;, and Eb&apos;&apos; too flat, and<br/>G#&apos;, D#&apos;&apos;, A#&apos; and E#&apos;&apos; too sharp. But if Eb is too flat, how can Ab<br/>not be? If Db is too flat, how can Gb not be? And, in Brad&apos;s imagined<br/>scheme where G-B is already sharp, how can Eb be too flat and D# too<br/>sharp at the same time? That would be really unfortunate.</p><p>What can we make of this contemporary description (Early Music August<br/>1997 p.429):<br/>&quot;M. Quantz&apos;s flutes differ from all others in their tuning. Usually<br/>the F on the transverse flute is not flat enough and the F#<br/>is correct; in his, on the contrary, the F is true and the F# a<br/>little flat. ...&quot;</p><p>Seems to me one ought to pay more attention to Quantz&apos;s flutes, rather<br/>than his (inevitably incomplete) verbal descriptions, to find out what<br/>he could have expected.<br/>I suspect people would be quite surprised by the degree of inequality<br/>one actually gets out of a Quantz flute. How&apos;s that Hazelzet recording?</p><p>Here&apos;s one modern flute maker (who made Hazelzet&apos;s replica):<br/><a href="http://www.baroqueflute.com/models/Quantz.html">www.baroqueflute.com/models/Quantz.html</a></p><p>&quot;The Quantz flute plays with a magnificent golden tone, particularly<br/>strong and clear in the lower part of the first octave.

Also ist ein<br/>gutes F viel wichtiger als ein gutes Fis etc. Diese Radikalit&auml;t der<br/>Intonation l&auml;sst viele moderne Spieler zur&uuml;ckschrecken (...)&quot;</p><p>basically: &apos;The original intonation is surprising, radical, and<br/>perhaps will make modern players wince. But Quantz thought it much<br/>more important to have a good F than a good F#&apos;.</p><p>This couldn&apos;t be anything like 1/6 comma: surely &apos;radical&apos; cannot mean<br/>anything but much *more* unequal - a *surprisingly* low F#.</p><p>And how about Tromlitz, a famous player in the late 18th century who<br/>radically developed the flute&apos;s mechanisms, in order to realize his<br/>belief that: &quot;intervals, either between melodic steps in the flute<br/>part, or between the flute and its accompanying bass part[!], should<br/>be played &apos;pure&apos;, and that tempering intervals on melody instruments<br/>was both impractical and undesirable.&quot;</p><p>And:<br/>&quot;It is possible for [the flute] to be more perfectly in tune than the<br/>keyboard, on which no interval except the octave can be quite pure<br/>[clearly 1/4-comma meantone had then been forgotten], so that it<br/>cannot agree in tuning all the time with a good flute-player who<br/>scrupulously observes everything that has been said above, or with a<br/>good violinist who plays in tune.&quot;</p><p>Could this be a clearer example of a demand for JI, or<br/>as-J-as-possible-I? Brad may try to reinterpret this via the<br/>sludge-tinted spectacles of &apos;Pure-actually-means-1/6-comma-tempered&apos;,<br/>but it just isn&apos;t possible without instant absurdity.</p><p>No matter how often people try to deny history, many good musicians in<br/>the 18th century (and earlier!) clearly did recognize and care about<br/>pure intervals, including pure thirds.

That is,<br/>Quantz was promoting (if not  promulgating) meantone, and sixth comma at that.<br/>Neither has mentioned that Quantz made  at least three flutes for Frederick with<br/>2 pairs of chromatic split  keys.  In normal parlance, with  which I agree<br/>with Ozan, this spells a non-1/4 comma extended meantone, due  to Quantz&apos;s<br/>discussion on not doubling a third and performing just  intervals on<br/>flexibly-pitched instruments.<br/>Tom has passionately presented his view that the flexibly pitched players<br/>would over-ride keyboard pitches (by six cents and more) in order to play  just.<br/> As a flexibly pitched  instrumentalist, I have an observation:  Only in a<br/>slow movement would &ldquo;some&rdquo; of the notes  be possibly altered to permit<br/>non-beating consonances to be recognized by an  audience.  In certain exceptional<br/>instances this could indeed be permitted.  But not enough to persuade me that<br/>this was any more in vogue than just  now described.<br/>It is understandable to be dubious of Brad&rsquo;s assertions, due to his past<br/>history of arguing a Rosetta Stone for Bach&rsquo;s tuning based on a puff of  smoke.<br/>That he found a tuning he  and others like is good for just that, a pleasant<br/>constellation of  relationships that work for chromatic music in a non-ET, or<br/>variegated,  fashion.  If he could find  himself lucid enough one day so that<br/>he could argue favorably for his  invented &quot;Lehman tuning&quot; (as opposed to<br/>describing it as a definitive &quot;Bach&rsquo;s  tuning&quot;) it will be most welcome.<br/>Unfortunately, not doing so will continue to color his assertions  about the basic<br/>issues of &ldquo;good and bad&rdquo; in terms of any meaningful  understanding intervals in<br/>period practice.<br/>Brad has dismissed WIII for Bach, which I think is unfortunate.  He hears a<br/>JS Bach Duetto in F major as  a &ldquo;Werckmeister III killer&rdquo; in that it will<br/>sound awful.  When I told of our successful  performance of Joshua Pierce<br/>performing the work on a piano in WIII, Brad  countered that it was not such a<br/>Werckmeister killer on the piano.  Every piece I ever experienced by Bach  performed<br/>in WIII worked in a revelatory manner.<br/>But I do love Brad&apos;s  experimentation.  I like his  willingness to try things<br/>out, and to report it to the List, even if his  conclusions are to be taken<br/>with more than a grain of salt due to his past  thesis publication.<br/>My take on Bach is that there are virtually no places to throw in a just<br/>interval as his music is regularly chromatic, and busy.  Having seen the scores<br/>to Frederick&rsquo;s music, it  can be easily theorized that the King wanted to get<br/>real D#s and real Ebs, so he  had them built into his last 3 flutes built for<br/>him by Quantz.  My take of Frederick&rsquo;s court is that  he discounted most<br/>Germans in literature, art, and to a lesser extent music, and  he was proud that he<br/>couldn&rsquo;t speak the German language.  It would be hard to force onto Frederick<br/>the many tuning practices popular in  Germany and throughout  Europe.<br/>Quantz came from Dresden,  which was a meantone hotbed during the Baroque;<br/>Silbermann made the keyboards in Dresden, and for the King, and  Silbermann was<br/>a sixth comma meantone enthusiast according to contemporary  sources.<br/>Tom seems to feel he has found a just intonation hotbed in Potsdam.<br/>(Frederick rarely went to Berlin.)   In contrast to Tom, I think it perfectly<br/>reasonable to believe that  Frederick and others performed in tune with a sixth comma<br/>meantone  keyhboard.  Performing on flexibly  pitched instrument in a set<br/>tuning like sixth comma meantone, or even 15-tone  equal temperament in a modern<br/>vocal piece, is much easier than many  suppose.  It is its own aesthetic.<br/>JS Bach has proved that &ldquo;all thirds tuned sharp&rdquo; is a laudatory tuning,  and<br/>the genie was out of the bottle, regardless of later preferences (possibly<br/>retro- preferences) of meantone tuning.  The term &quot;modified meantone&quot; is a<br/>phrase I find confusing (much as pentatonic tuning); it&rsquo;s just more of a catch<br/>all than anything specific to be recognized by the ear.  But the ear, my<br/>musical sense screams  loudly to me, must take into account the tuning of the<br/>keyboard when a  duplication of a pitch is desired, as well as when determining a<br/>just  relationship off of an established pitch on the keyboard.  This seems  an<br/>impractical solution for any but the most prolonged harmonies, used  as a<br/>nuance to the temperament.  Perhaps there is a recording Tom might  recommend?<br/>Best, Johnny</p><p>**************************************Check out AOL&apos;s list of 2007&apos;s hottest<br/>products.<br/>(<a href="http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001</a>)</p></div><h3><a id=74499 href="#74499">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2007 8:56:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny wrote (among other things):</p><p>&gt; Tom has passionately presented his view that the flexibly pitched<br/>&gt; players would over-ride keyboard pitches (by six cents and more)<br/>&gt; in order to play  just.

But not<br/>&gt; enough to persuade me that this was any more in vogue than<br/>&gt; just  now described.</p><p>This position (i.e. only slow movements give enough opportunity to<br/>bend things that far...) makes sense to me, too.</p><p>Furthermore: if Tom really would allow a six-cent leeway for bending<br/>things up or down, especially in the placement of major or minor<br/>thirds, then I don&apos;t see what his complaint is against Dr Ross<br/>Duffin&apos;s book.  Duffin recommends that ensembles playing 18th century<br/>music start from a basis of extended 1/6 comma, and if they want to<br/>bend the occasional open 5th up to pure 3:2, or the occasional major<br/>3rd down to pure 5:4, they can.  By going down the middle with 1/6<br/>here, as the basis, both these options present themselves.<br/>Welllll...bend your regular 1/6 comma major 3rd down *six cents* at a<br/>cadence and there you are!  So: what&apos;s Tom&apos;s complaint against either<br/>Duffin, or against 18th century musicians such as Tosi and Quantz<br/>*also* setting 1/6 as a standard, if such a six-cents fudging is<br/>going to come into it too?</p><p>&gt; It is understandable to be dubious of Brad&acirc;Â€Â™s assertions, due to<br/>&gt; his past history of arguing a Rosetta Stone for Bach&acirc;Â€Â™s tuning<br/>&gt; based on a puff of  smoke.</p><p>Ummm....&quot;puff of smoke&quot;?

It frankly takes a couple of<br/>months to play through all the pieces that I say are important to the<br/>argument, listening closely to the way these pieces sound<br/>unconvincing in *other* temperaments:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html</a></p><p>&gt; That he found a tuning he  and others like is good for just that, a<br/>&gt; pleasant constellation of  relationships that work for chromatic<br/>&gt; music in a non-ET, or variegated,  fashion.</p><p>This sounds a bit like your preference for Werckmeister III, Johnny:<br/>you like it so much for all your own and your ensemble&apos;s<br/>musicianship, in music of that period, no other temperaments need<br/>apply.  If you fancy Werckmeister III, you&apos;re certainly welcome to<br/>use it as much as you want.  I had five solid years of experience<br/>playing in Werckmeister III myself (in grad school) and hearing all<br/>my classmates play *everything* in it, since it was a temp in<br/>standard use at that school...and I find it hard to listen to with<br/>any pleasure anymore.  It misshapes the music (in my opinion).  The<br/>only major composer in whose music I can hear it *maybe* applying<br/>appropriately is Buxtehude: who (notably) didn&apos;t use extended flats<br/>in much of his organ or harpsichord music.  WIII is much kinder to<br/>sharps than flats....</p><p>&gt; If he could find<br/>&gt; himself lucid enough one day so that he could argue favorably for<br/>&gt; his invented &quot;Lehman tuning&quot; (as opposed to describing it as a<br/>&gt; definitive &quot;Bach&acirc;Â€Â™s  tuning&quot;) it will be most welcome.<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, not doing so will continue to color his assertions<br/>&gt; about the basic issues of &acirc;Â€Âœgood and bad&acirc;Â€&#x9D; in terms of any<br/>&gt; meaningful  understanding intervals in period practice.</p><p>I believe I&apos;m plenty lucid....</p><p>&gt; Brad has dismissed WIII for Bach, which I think is unfortunate.  He<br/>&gt; hears a JS Bach Duetto in F major as  a &acirc;Â€ÂœWerckmeister III<br/>&gt; killer&acirc;Â€&#x9D; in that it will sound awful.</p><p>Which it does, played on harpsichords and organs.  The whole middle<br/>section of its A-B-A structure is a mess, in Werckmeister III, on<br/>those instruments.  As for my argued &quot;dismissal&quot; of WIII for Bach,<br/>that&apos;s mostly in the printed section 2 of my article as cited above:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html</a><br/>...with some additional remarks about &quot;O Mensch, bewein&quot; BWV 622 in<br/>the PDF file that goes with that.  I needn&apos;t repeat myself, to any<br/>who have already read my opinions about it there.</p><p>&gt; When I told of our successful  performance of Joshua Pierce<br/>&gt; performing the work on a piano in WIII, Brad  countered that it was<br/>&gt; not such a Werckmeister killer on the piano.  Every piece I ever<br/>&gt; experienced by Bach  performed in WIII worked in a revelatory<br/>&gt; manner.</p><p>OK, but &quot;revelatory&quot; within what context?  And on what instruments?<br/>I listened to your CD samples on the web last year, and no offense<br/>intended to either you or Ms Pechevsky (the harpsichordist), but the<br/>Bach D minor prelude/fugue sounded frankly ugly to me.  Tastes<br/>differ.  I don&apos;t fancy that Bach would have written something to<br/>sound that crunchy on purpose, but maybe I just haven&apos;t been open to<br/>the same type of &quot;revelation&quot; in that direction.  Playing all of<br/>Bach&apos;s harpsichord for myself, in dozens of different temperaments<br/>for experimentation, WIII gives some of the (in my opinion) ugliest<br/>effects.  If Bach really intended such, it&apos;s an image of Bach I have<br/>a hard time stomaching.</p><p>As for pianos: modern pianos have such a different harmonic structure<br/>in their tone, as compared with harpsichords, they allow more leeway<br/>for major 3rds and minor 3rds to be grossly vigorous.  (That&apos;s a<br/>subjective assessment, of course, but the weakness of piano overtones<br/>is a physical fact....)</p><p>How else could some other people come up with the following scheme<br/>using the Bach drawing, present *only* piano samples, and promote<br/>their temperament as &quot;The Temperament of God&quot;?<br/>- F-C-G-D-A-E narrowed by 1/4 comma;<br/>- E-B-F#-C# pure;<br/>- C#-G#-Eb-Bb wide 1/12 comma each;<br/>- Bb-F pure.<br/><a href="http://bach1722.com/">http://bach1722.com/</a></p><p>They say they&apos;ve presented the entire Well-Tempered Clavier played<br/>this way on a piano.

I&apos;ve written up<br/>some additional comments about it at the<br/>section &quot;Interbartolo/Venturino&quot; here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/bachtemps.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/bachtemps.html</a></p><p>And where&apos;s their schisma?

The<br/>&quot;puff of smoke&quot; is the so-called secret code from upside  down ornamental<br/>squiggles.  It has been increasingly clear that other  composers ornamented music in<br/>the same manner.  But you go further,  claiming exact intervals to be<br/>interpreted.  And then to say it was for his  Leipzig audition.  It does not pass the<br/>believability test.</p><p>However, I certainly do understand how important is to stay  to long held<br/>convictions.  There are a number of prominent  composers/writers who have<br/>published their convictions, changed them, but  refused to republish the changes.<br/>Perhaps it is simply human nature.   Maybe that&apos;s why you think I have a similar<br/>fixation on WIII?  Could be,  but I don&apos;t think so.  :)</p><p>&gt; It is understandable to be dubious of  Brad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s assertions, due to<br/>&gt; his past history of arguing a Rosetta Stone  for Bach&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tuning<br/>&gt; based on a puff of smoke.</p><p>When you say &quot;these  pieces sound<br/>unconvincing in *other* temperaments&quot; I truly wonder.   After all, doesn&apos;t<br/>Bach sound convincing in 12 ET for the great unwashed?   With Tom ready to<br/>smudge by 6 cents in a non-vibrato world, or more, do you not  realize that we are,<br/>in the general sense, victims of our own experiences?   Isaac Newton wrote<br/>about this, Bosanquet, too.  Every time Tom brings up  Marpurg, I feel<br/>revulsion.  This is not about Tom, or what he said, only  that I am a historical<br/>&quot;friend&quot; of Kirnberger, as Paul could tell you.  And  Marpurg treated K like crap,<br/>and undeservedly so.  Compared to K, Marpurg  was an amateur.  Although it was<br/>clever of Tom to connect a modified  meantone to a published Marpurg keyboard<br/>temperament.</p><p>&gt; That he found a tuning he and others like is good  for just that, a<br/>&gt; pleasant constellation of relationships that work for  chromatic<br/>&gt; music in a non-ET, or variegated, fashion.</p><p>&lt;This  sounds a bit like your preference for Werckmeister III, Johnny:<br/>you like it  so much for all your own and your ensemble&apos;s<br/>musicianship, in music of that  period, no other temperaments need<br/>apply.&gt;</p><p>Right on cue!  Only, there isn&apos;t any  competition.  There is no basis for<br/>your temperament in Bach&apos;s world,  while Werckmeister III is the only circular<br/>well temperament widely disseminated  in the generation just before Bach&apos;s, and<br/>in his very  Thuringian neighborhood.</p><p>&lt;I had five solid years of experience<br/>playing in  Werckmeister III myself (in grad school) and hearing all<br/>my classmates play  *everything* in it, since it was a temp in<br/>standard use at that school...and  I find it hard to listen to with<br/>any pleasure anymore.&gt;</p><p>Johnny:  That&apos;s a valuable, and honest, admission.   Many orchestral<br/>musicians revile Beethoven&apos;s Fifth for its familiarity.   Bassoonists can have a life<br/>long battle with the Mozart Bassoon Concerto.   It was an early wind concerto<br/>which moderns want to over think it and make  it more complex than it is.  It<br/>is the basis of all audition  criticism, with each critic in a bassoon jury<br/>packed with opinions about &quot;how&quot;  it should be played, usually differently one<br/>bassoonist to the  other.  And students playing anything?  Well, that reminds<br/>me of the  old saying that if one is a band director for a high school for too<br/>long the  acceptance of what is good music sinks. ;)</p><p>&lt;It misshapes the music (in my opinion). The<br/>only major  composer in whose music I can hear it *maybe* applying<br/>appropriately is  Buxtehude: who (notably) didn&apos;t use extended flats<br/>in much of his organ or  harpsichord music. WIII is much kinder to<br/>sharps than  flats....&gt;</p><p>I agree Buxtehude sounds good in WIII.  Later Buxtehude,  once he was using a<br/>non-meantone tuning does have a magic that ET certainly  dissolves.  Dowland<br/>is boring as all get out when it is in ET, as regularly  attested to by The<br/>New York Times Reviews I have read.  And not one lute  player has played Dowland<br/>in the irregular tuning proscribed by his son  Robert.  (still waiting).<br/>Thanks to Wim Hoogewerf for playing Dowland  on a microtonal guitar!</p><p>Brad, by revelatory I first and foremost mean the  comparison of WIII to ET.<br/>That is always revelatory.  Next comes the  conclusion that other irregularly<br/>tuned tunings have some of the valuable  elements that demand recordings in<br/>non-ET tunings.  Then there is the  certitude that I know that JS Bach was<br/>thoroughly familiar with WIII, even more  than you were.  And since it was the<br/>very first and only circular tuning  for the only fully chromatic composer of the<br/>Baroque era, it is not a big leap  for me.</p><p>To that end I am compiling scholarship that will lead others  to this<br/>understanding.  I will look forward to your comments once it is  unveiled.  It<br/>certainly one be my first unpublished scholarly work in  music.</p><p>&gt; I listened to your CD samples on the web last year,  and no offense<br/>intended to either you or Ms Pechevsky (the harpsichordist),  but the<br/>Bach D minor prelude/fugue sounded frankly ugly to me.

That you find any of these  intervals &quot;ugly&quot; is exactly my point.</p><p>&lt;Playing all of<br/>Bach&apos;s harpsichord for myself, in  dozens of different temperaments<br/>for experimentation, WIII gives some of the  (in my opinion) ugliest<br/>effects. If Bach really intended such, it&apos;s an image  of Bach I have<br/>a hard time stomaching.&gt;</p><p>Maybe you got disoriented from all the experimentation?   Musical car<br/>sickness?  Maybe you wouldn&apos;t care for other Thuringian  cultural aspects: food?<br/>architecture?  politics?   etc.</p><p>&lt;As for pianos: modern pianos have such a different harmonic  structure<br/>in their tone, as compared with harpsichords, they allow more  leeway<br/>for major 3rds and minor 3rds to be grossly vigorous. (That&apos;s  a<br/>subjective assessment, of course, but the weakness of piano overtones<br/>is  a physical fact....)&gt;</p><p>Grossly vigorous?  One thing for sure, we all have  different precisions of<br/>our ears.  Aaron K. might counter, but that&apos;s only  your opinion.  And I would<br/>turn sad.  The fact is that there are  differences in all human abilities.<br/>Most importantly, this is not meant  towards any individual, nor is it ever to<br/>be involved in an embarrassment.   It&apos;s a fact.  In my group, I have become the<br/>monochord, the electric  tuner.  It is my ear that makes the judgments.  And<br/>yes, mistakes can  be made, but they are just that, mistakes.</p><p>When new information comes  that dismisses WIII as the most likely tuning for<br/>JS Bach, especially in his  Arnstadt, Muhlhausen, and Weimar years, then I<br/>will jump off WIII like rats off  a ship.  But the history of the Bach period<br/>has been so distorted that I am  making an effort to reevaluate everything.<br/>Like just intonation afficiando  Descartes in his &quot;Meditations,&quot; I simply cannot<br/>trust my senses.  And  the aforementioned puff of smoke does not at all<br/>substitute with an intellectual  truth.  It needn&apos;t.
