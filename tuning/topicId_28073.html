As a<br/>transplanted New Yorker (now in NH) with many friends and family still<br/>living in the city, I feel truly blessed that my family and friends are<br/>alive (so far as I know at present). I feel great compassion for everyone<br/>whose families and friends didn&apos;t survive.</p><p>During the last two days of teaching music, preparing for upcoming gigs this<br/>weekend (performing and teaching at a fiddle camp and playing klezmer for a<br/>UU Rosh Hoshana service) and talking with everyone I know about these<br/>events, I feel deeply committed to a vision of constant striving to be a<br/>source of love and light with my music and actions in these times of<br/>darkness.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p></div>
