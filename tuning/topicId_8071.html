I converted the MP3 to WAV.  The<br/>&gt; error range is +/- 1.3 hertz.  I have included the frequency range as the<br/>&gt; software does not identify precise frequencies.  The first column indicates<br/>&gt; the frequency obtained at the center of each band.  I attenuated the<br/>&gt; amplitude of the sample to narrow the frequency band.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Frequency    Range            Atttenuation<br/>&gt; 262 htz           259-267             9 dec                   cant<br/>&gt; 337                332-340              18 dec                 by<br/>&gt; 405                402-407             18 dec                   me<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looks like that third very close to 9/7!  If anyone doubts the analysis, I<br/>&gt; will send screen shots justifying the frequencies I chose.</p><p>Darren: my compliments for what seems to be a very precize analysis. I did<br/>some strumming and singing, like Joe, with the record in my mind, but I<br/>still didn&apos;t hear the E as being higher than usual. It felt more as if the C<br/>was much lower. In fact the very first chord which comes in after the words<br/>&quot;Can&apos;t buy me&quot; in is E minor and not C major. The first C (&quot;Can&apos;t&quot;)<br/>McCartney sings is may be attracted downwards to the B in the E minor chord<br/>that follows. If we tune this C upwards from 262 to 270 Hz the C - E - G<br/>triad would be a virtually perfect 4:5:6.</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
