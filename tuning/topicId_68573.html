Most of what I could bring out about musicologists would be annecdotal.  You may have thought previously about this question, of a chasm in understanding.</p><p>Guess the big difference is that I get &quot;intelligence&quot; from the music, which is alluded to by Clark.  Yes, the instruments themselves tell a story, which is largely out of the experience of the musicologists.</p><p>Then there seems to be an extraordinary value placed on making it a science, but &quot;they&quot; get different signals, and have different priorities.  Sorry to say it, but a lot of the melee is about power.  Whenever there is no money involved, Academics dig in to protect their power.  It seems I have little investment to hold on to in respect to any particular power (since there really is none).</p><p>Luck of the draw, I guess.  Since I studied musicology at Columbia University, it seems a clear cut difference in approach.  Alas, it cannot bridge from the composer to the modern listener without the musician component.  And all to often then opt to leave the musician out.</p><p>And of course there are musicians and musicains, and musicologists and musiclogists, always exceptions</p><p>best, Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
