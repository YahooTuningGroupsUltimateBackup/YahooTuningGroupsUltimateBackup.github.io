Letter<br/>name is so impractical because the system of sharps and flats and related<br/>notes has no logic to it.  Write a piece in E major, and the Major third, is<br/>G#, implying that it is an altered note, but it is not.  Interval is a 10-times<br/>better way to think about music, and any serious trained musician<br/>understands intervals like e.g. &quot;perfect fourth.&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Pitch bend<br/>&gt; &gt; Aaaron<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This has now become a redundant system for microtuning.

I&apos;m talking about not using<br/>pitch bend to acheive microtonal harmonies, I&apos;m thinking to use it only<br/>for KEY CHANGES and strong progression changes.<br/>I&apos;d set up all my notes within .tun files or whatever, and then when I<br/>wanted to shift to a II7-V7-I progression, I&apos;d use one overall pitch bend<br/>signal to shift everying first by 204cents and then up another 498 and then<br/>back to center.  That&apos;s IT.  Then I can have a V9 chord without including<br/>27/16 in my original system, for example.  So the whole progression would<br/>only have three total pitch bend entries.<br/>Would you still say that this is a bad idea and I should avoid pitch bending?</p><p>-Aaron</p></div>
