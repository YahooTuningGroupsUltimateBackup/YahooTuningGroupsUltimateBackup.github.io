Yes, I<br/>do have a few criticisms.  But they should be received in the context of<br/>overall delight.</p><p>I very VERY much approve of the basic premise of the disk: using the<br/>human voice as a musical instrument.  With few exceptions, there are<br/>no &quot;words&quot; recognizable in any spoken language; rather, the voices are<br/>used to form musical syllables.</p><p>The one non-voice instrument is a guitar (classical?) adeptly played<br/>by John Link himself in every one of the cuts (second listening: not<br/>quite all).  For the most part, it provides a good accompaniment to the<br/>voices, but at times I grew tired of it, and wished either for no<br/>instrument at all, or another, or for it to be pulled back a bit in the<br/>mix...</p><p>The women (two sopranos) are IMHO excellent, with clear lovely voices.</p><p>At times I was critical of the pitch control of the male voices.  Please<br/>understand, this is coming from someone who loves to sing, but whose<br/>voice is lacking compared to anyone on the CD.</p><p>All arrangements are by John Link.  Included are compositions by famous<br/>names: Mussorgsky, Debussy, Satie, Chick Corea, and Miles Davis, plus<br/>other composers whose names I don&apos;t recognize, and several pieces by<br/>John himself.  The largest of these last is a 7-movement work called<br/>&quot;Suite for Quintet&quot; in rondo form (A-B-A-C-A-D-A) which is very nice,<br/>showing strong promise as a composer.</p><p>Since this is a recording of a live performance, there are occasional<br/>coughs (there&apos;s one in every audience).</p><p>Strictly speaking, the disk is not &quot;microtonal&quot;; it is 12-tET, as far as<br/>my ear can tell.  But, as I occasionally admit, JI is not the most<br/>important component to good music; many other factors make or break a<br/>performance.  Count this disk as &quot;make&quot;.</p><p>I ordered mine for $15 plus $3 shipping (more outside the U.S.) from:</p><p>   John Link<br/>   141 West 26th Street, 3rd Floor<br/>   New York  NY  10001</p><p>John, the spirit of music is with you.  I&apos;m ready to buy your next CD<br/>when it&apos;s released!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
