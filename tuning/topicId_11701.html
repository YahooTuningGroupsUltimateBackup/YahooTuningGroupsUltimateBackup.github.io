It has been an interesting read.

I&apos;ve been going through the posts on the tuning list and have seen yours, as well as the discussion about consonance vs. concordance. To me, it&apos;s so much hoo hah. After looking up the two terms in various dictionaries at work, some music, some not, I have come to the conclusion that they are essentially two senses of the same term, therefore I can&apos;t say that I agree with Paul Erlich on his distinction (or Blackwood, though I have yet to read his book cover-to-cover). If we&apos;re going to make such a distinction, then it seems to me that we also have to come up with a term that will separate mathematical consonance from subjective consonance. A 4:5:6:7 chord is mathematically consonant, since each interval within it exists in symetry with the others, with difference tones that are octave transpositions of tones already present in the chord. A 4:5:6:7 could sound dissonant is if it was voiced too low, in which case the difference tones could be low enough to be perceived as beats instead of logical bass tones, but it would still be mathematically consonant. On the other hand, there seem to be those who say that tunings other than just are consonant (or is it concordant?). Interesting. I see no mathematical basis for this viewpoint. Maybe I&apos;ve misinterpreted? Of course there are plenty of &quot;dissonant&quot; constructs that sound great, but they&apos;re still dissonant. As a player, my ears tell me what is consonant, and they usually agree with the mathematical model.

I am a jazz player too, and there are many jazz chords that don&apos;t work well in the just scale, 7-limit or not. In fact, 12tET has spawned harmonic extensions that sound really cool in 12tET, but not so good when tuned to just intervals. As if such a thing could even be done with some chords. Try tuning the beats out of a G13#11! But it sounds very nice in 12tET. So when I play jazz, I play just intervals when I can, but don&apos;t worry about it much otherwise.</p><p>Well, there you have it, my 2 cents.<br/>Well, I guess it was more like a comma... -- groan! --</p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>Patrick K.

What power there is in an interval or chord when difference tones in the bass support it!  I believe this is why it is so very natural for amateur a capella singers (I&apos;m thinking particularly of barbershop quartet singers in the club SPEBSQSA)  to lock in the 7/4 dom 7th in spite of its rarity in the music to which they may be accustomed.</p></div><h3>Patrick K.

I Just wanted to pass on a<br/>brief point that I once came across (and that I&apos;ve already posted to<br/>the list before regarding this; especially in the context of the<br/>tuning of the dominant seventh chord)... I remember reading in Joseph<br/>Yasser&apos;s 1930s &quot;A Theory of Evolving Tonality,&quot; a bit where he<br/>specifically mentions that the a cappella music of the Russian<br/>church -- free from the influence of equal temperament -- avoids the<br/>4:5:6:7 dominant seventh... that the seven tone diatonic scale itself<br/>(so constructed), &apos;necessitates&apos; a more &apos;tense&apos; intonation... and that<br/>the overall context (i.e., the need to establish resolution here),<br/>even in this variable pitch, a cappella context, overrides whatever<br/>the most aurally expedient isolated tuning of this chord itself might<br/>be... While I can&apos;t pretend to vouch for the accuracy of the account,<br/>I thought I&apos;d pass it on as I found it interesting in the context of<br/>this discussion.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/9/2001 3:28:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was listening to some examples of this very interesting idea, and<br/>to Verklarte Nacht in particular.
