Actually it can be used or might be helpful in getting more pitches depending on how one alters the position of your bridge.  For those who memory fails them for the moment, the Lesser Perfect System [LPS for those who prefer those unpoetic shorthand] was a system in which 3 tetrachords were arranged in conjunct fashion [without disjunction to cause a repetition at the octave]. I discovered that if one arranges the chromatic tetrachords in this fashion and one still retains pitches a 3/2 [or close intervals, i have my bridges separated from each other] I end up with a &quot;chromatic&quot; instrument. From Erv i have learned that diagrams are often clearer. So here is the array expressed in 12 ET terms<br/>the left row shares the bridge with both sides being used with the right traditionally being an octave lower than the highest.<br/>C5/F4    B4/E4          C#4<br/>A#4/D#4        A#3<br/>G4/C4          A3<br/>F#4/B3         G#3<br/>F4/A#3         F3<br/>D4/G3          E3<br/>C#4/F#3        D#3<br/>C4/F3          C3<br/>A3/D3          B2<br/>G#3/C#3        A#2<br/>G3/C3          G2</p><p>the resulting set of pitches are as follows from low to high<br/>G2 A#2 B2<br/>C3 C#3 D3 D#3 E3 F3 F#3 G3 G#3 A3 A#3 B3<br/>C4 C#4 D4 D#4 E4 F4 F#4 G4    A#4 B4 C5<br/>a full &quot;chromatic&quot; scale from A#2-G4</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU 88.9 fm Wed. 8-9pm PST.<br/>live stream <a href="http://kxlu.com">kxlu.com</a></p></div>
