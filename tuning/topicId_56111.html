With most of wind instruments, for instance.<br/>But Meantone, I agree, sounds much better than E.T. At least for<br/>music in western tradition.<br/>But as soon as you want to justify also the fifths to J.I., you will<br/>get unsolvable mathematical problems. At least with non real time means.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You are praying for a musical world without beats.</p><p>Once again, this was said to Charles Lucy.</p><p>&gt;One of the most confusing aspects of hanging out in the tuning<br/>&gt;community is that people keep trying to characterize you as either a<br/>&gt;JI person or not. In my case, that won&apos;t work.</p><p>JI is a &quot;wide field&quot; (in German: &quot;Weites Feld&quot;) and the members of<br/>this community move in this wide range between &quot;funamentalists&quot; and<br/>mor &quot;compromise liking persons&quot;. I belong to the last ones.</p><p>It seems that some persons assume that I am prefering  a tuning<br/>&quot;Mismach&quot;. No, my idea is also, that the complete tuning of a score<br/>will sound best, when the tuning of all instruments will be the same.<br/>But...<br/>When we developed the idea of Hermode Tuning we tried to optimize<br/>the tuning of hardware keyboards. Sequencers, computer music and<br/>expanders have been still in the minority. And it was our idea that<br/>this new keyboard tuning should be a model for a dynamic tuning<br/>of wind and string instrumentalists and for singers in well<br/>educated orchestras, chamber music ensembles and choirs.<br/>On the other hand this tuning should be compatible to the fix tuning<br/>(almost E.T. or near to. E.T) of acoustic pianos, accordeons,<br/>guitars, pipe organs and so on. As we don&apos;t like to seperate<br/>the world in elctronic musical instruments and acoustic musical<br/>instruments. And we wanted to create a model, controlling in real<br/>time, for Live music.<br/>Therefore Hermode Tuning controls always three parameters:<br/>Tuning ratios according to positions according, or at least near to J.I.<br/>as to the preferences of the user/ almost inaudible retuning steps/<br/>positions as near as possible to E.T.<br/>This means: combinations of musical instruments with<br/>Hermode Tuning and acoustic instruments with E.T. indeed will perform<br/>a mismach, but the result sounds better than &quot;All instruments in E.T.&quot;<br/>See the sound example &quot;Charpentier&quot; at our website. First as<br/>&quot;Mismach&quot;, than as &quot;All E.T&quot;.</p><p>Now it seems that &quot;logic 7&quot; gives the user the possibility to<br/>create such a &quot;Mismach&quot; as an image to real existing<br/>music performances. (I say &quot;it seems&quot; as I am still missing<br/>my copy - and I never got a Beta Test version).<br/>But -if so - why not? Everyone is free to create with<br/>Hermode Tuning a real time tuning model  either of<br/>absolute Just Intonation with 3/5/7 limit or only 3/5 limit<br/>or a reduced degree of Just Intonation or a Mismach according<br/>to his personally preferences or practical requirments.<br/>And this &quot;giving freedom&quot;, indeed, distinguishes my ideas<br/>of these of the fundamentalists.</p><p>Best</p><p>Werner</p></div>
