social interaction from the Internet that any formal course<br/>could have taught me.</p><p>I often wounder why this is, I mean, is this just because of me?</p><p>Another thing that really occurred to me, was my inability to essentailly<br/>predict the future, and also difficulty I have planning ahead.</p><p>Sometimes mathematics can prove counter-intuitive,-I have difficulty<br/>predicting EXACTLY how such-and-such will trun out, and I thought that this<br/>next little project would turn out a lot easier than what I had anticipated,<br/>but this wasn&apos;t the case, it was actually qite difficult.</p><p>One such example is what happened to me when I tryed to formulate rules for<br/>the FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ARITHMETIC variants,-this is, more correctly, my<br/>proposed experiments with the use of the n-bocinni series to essentially act<br/>as the prime number series, a sort of &quot;stnad in&quot;, when it comes to useing<br/>these numbers as a product series for designateing tuning ratios based on<br/>just intonation.</p><p>May I ask you: IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE THE N-BOCINNI SERIES TO ACT AS A<br/>PRODUCT SERIES WHEN EACH N-BOCINNI MEMBER IS RASIED TO A NUMBER AS A<br/>COEFFICIENT, AND ESSENTIALLY THUS, TO GIVE ANY NUMBER IN OUR JUST INTONATION<br/>RATIO?</p><p>Thus:</p><p>     t(n)   t(n+1)   t(n+2)  t(n+3)  t(n+4)........  t(n+a)<br/>    ^+/-A   ^+/-B    ^+/-C    ^+/-D  ^+/-E           ^+/-N       = X/Y</p><p>.......essentially these numbers as terms of the n-bocinni series, instead<br/>of the prime number series.</p><p>I must ask, using MULTIPLICATION and multiplication alone, how effective are<br/>the terms of the n-bocinni series, and terms of the series n^2 as compared<br/>to the primes?</p><p>I know that 2^n is utterly useless, it merely gives a series full of holes<br/>when these are multiplied, the effect is even more pronounced when<br/>superpowers are used.</p><p>As I said, Joe Monzo has shown me now, the basic procedure for application<br/>of the prime number series for making lattices, and I got to woundering<br/>about the use of other seires.</p><p>Given the:</p><p>Fibonacci series: t(n+1)=t(n-1)+t(n), essentially<br/>term(new)=term(old)+term(older), we get the well known: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,<br/>13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144....</p><p>Tribonacci series t(n+2)=t(n+1)+t(n)+t(n-1): 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81,<br/>149, 274, 504....</p><p>Quadbonacci series t(n+3)=t(n+2)+t(n+1)+t(n)+t(n-1): 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 29,<br/>56, 108, 208, 401, 773.....</p><p>Pentbonacci series t(n+4)=t(n+3)+t(n+2)+t(n+1)+t(n)+t(n-1): 1, 1, 2, 4, 8,<br/>16, 31, 61, 120, 236...</p><p>I am thinking about the different tuning and JI lattices that could be made<br/>from, and for the interaction of the prime number series, as from this<br/>FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ARITHMETIC, and when playing around with the concept,<br/>I have thought of something.</p><p>If I list some matrices, using the n-bocinni and the prime number series, I<br/>can perhaps, at least for most of them, get a system which uses ta product<br/>of these numbers, rasied to a power coefficient, and, I have choosen a juicy<br/>temperament that I liked the look of, -a temperament, that is, based on<br/>these numbers, but when I actually sat down to do this, it turned out to be<br/>a lot more difficult to do than I first thought.</p><p>So, is there any one here who is a dab hand at computer programming, and<br/>could acess the effects of all the possible combinations of the n-bocinni<br/>series, when these are multiplied by each other, and put to ratios, and as<br/>to the lowest possible terms of these ratios to approximateing the JI ratios<br/>used?</p><p>The reason that I ask this is because it will be painstakeing work to do<br/>this by sight, and hand,-it could very well take months.</p><p>I have now, by the way, found a power seire that generates the golden<br/>proportion.</p><p>****The Bohlen-Pierce scale structures site gives the following diatonic<br/>scale -- the &quot;Lambda scale&quot;:</p><p>1/1 25/21 9/7 7/5 5/3 9/5 15/7 7/3 25/9 3/1</p><p>Thus, to place this in the prime number series, the Fibonacci number series,<br/>the tribonacci number series, and the quadbocinni and pentbonacci series:</p><p>2   3    5    7    11   13   17   19   23<br/>    -1   2   -1<br/>

????????</p><p>I thought that it would just be a matter of having the JI intonation ration<br/>of this Bohlen-Peirce intonation&apos;s ratios compared individualluy to the<br/>specific n-bocinni&apos;s ratios as multiplied combinations, and when these<br/>ratios are simplified, we could acess the closeness of each.</p><p>The next part, having done this, is the fun bit!</p><p>We then can interpolate each with other n-bocinnis and make lattices from them.</p><p>Any ideas??</p><p>---Sarn.</p></div>
