I heard a jazz vocal group do<br/>a 5 minute arrangement with a few dozens of dozens of &apos;rich&apos;<br/>chords and more than a handful of key changes. By the end (we<br/>dropped the needle at the beginning and end for fun) they were<br/>about a third of a tone away from any common point of reference.<br/>But you&apos;d never know it. This is just adaptive tuning at its best.</p><p>To PageWizard: (1) : you stated</p><p>&gt;     There is nothing that is &quot;acceptable&quot; if acceptable is your word<br/>&gt; referring to cultural conditioning.  I prefer not to live in an illusion<br/>&gt; where I believe that consonance is based on approximations and not the real<br/>&gt; thing.  To me, modulation can live in its own artificial state, and I can<br/>&gt; choose the pure ratios.  Any ET system is artificial and will never represent<br/>&gt; the pure ratios accurately because it is uncapable of doing so.  Anything is<br/>&gt; deemed acceptable on my own terms, not on what other people convince me of.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are correct, ETs approximating just ratios allow for &quot;exact same<br/>modulation&quot; which some have found to be a useful musical property. You<br/>seem to be expressing that &quot;beat free harmonies&quot; are a property you<br/>find very important. I hope you have already gotten in touch with the<br/>Just Intonation Network website (materials, Dotys book is a good intro<br/>to JI, yes, with lattice diagrams)... and others have suggested<br/>getting Partches book etc...</p><p>Check out all the music on the crazymusic list (one of the many sister<br/>lists to this one).</p><p>Note however, in your comments regarding &quot;cultural conditioning&quot; that,<br/>yes, everything (at least in the backing tracks) coming over MTV is<br/>for the most part 12tet. This is not true for lots of music all over<br/>the world. But it would be equally untrue to say that those musics are all<br/>based on &quot;low numbered integer ratios&quot;.</p><p>My point is that &quot;beat free harmonies&quot; are a very small facet<br/>of what one may be looking for when you make the jump to &quot;gee,<br/>I don&apos;t HAVE to play in 12...&quot;. As Jacky alluded to in response to<br/>my earlier post, adding &quot;tuning&quot; to your bag of variables as a<br/>composer or player opens up much more than just getting consonances<br/>more in tune. Jacky (who&apos;s successfully made microtonal music on his<br/>quest, unlike me in mine) seems to look at a &quot;big three&quot; of<br/>&quot;timbre, rhythm and tuning&quot; (which is fascinating Jacky). I&apos;m<br/>coming from a &quot;melody, harmony, rhythm&quot; background and trying<br/>to head much more towards a &quot;melodies, rhythm&quot; thing.</p><p>Joseph: re : &quot;Exactly what is wrong in striving for just<br/>intonation??&quot; Nothing, although your phrase does indicate a<br/>little about what our esteemed colleague may be railing against.<br/>The queation we are trying to answer is &quot;how do I make a new<br/>piece of music that I&apos;ll be able to enjoy by my criteria (fun<br/>to make, fun to play, people like it, I like it, etc). Just<br/>Intonation (or any tuning paradigm for that matter) will be<br/>only one component that goes into this. Some people imply<br/>that JI is the way that &quot;nature is tuned&quot; and that therefor,<br/>music should be tuned this way and there is something wrong<br/>that it isn&apos;t. This seems to be more of a &quot;religious&quot; belief,<br/>which is what our friend seems to be railing against. My limited<br/>play with JI led me to say &quot;bumpy melodically, smooth harmonys<br/>(sometimes, some of them are a bit more ferocious), and these<br/>qualities didn&apos;t lead me to the &quot;new piece of music&quot;. (Ooops,<br/>back to square one).</p><p>I think its true that the music of the world seems to<br/>favor approximations to small numbered ratios in pitch materials. It<br/>is equally true that rhythmically, most musics seem to favor<br/>heirarchys of small number time divisions. However, these two<br/>statements leave a tremendous amount of room for play in the<br/>pitch and rhythm spaces, and there are more components to<br/>music than that!</p><p>Enough for now, I wanted to say something about lattices,<br/>but since they don&apos;t say too much for me, I&apos;m a bit less<br/>able to respond there. (The information in lattices doesn&apos;t<br/>show me what I like to know about<br/>   where can I exactly repeat melodies in a tuning system usually<br/>doesn&apos;t sho</p><p>PageWizard: regarding lattices</p><p>So far, the information in lattices didn&apos;t say too much to me<br/>because it doesn&apos;t express melodic materials in a clear way.<br/>(Melodic materials in a harmonic tuning system are usually<br/>a side effect of that system, making one wonder if the whole<br/>thing isn&apos;t being built backwards...) They also tend not to<br/>show &apos;puns&apos; in ET systems in a very clear manner (&quot;this<br/>endpoint connects to this one...&quot;)</p><p>I will say that good people use them, so they must be good for<br/>something, and I&apos;ll let them explain what it.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
