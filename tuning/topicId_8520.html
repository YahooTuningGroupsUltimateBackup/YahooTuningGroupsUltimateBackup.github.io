That means the uncertainty<br/>in diminished fifths is greater than the difference between diminished<br/>fifths and augmented fourths.  So, if you expect the size to be determined<br/>by its functional context, the spelling is merely to underline the<br/>function.  Either you decide what size the intervals are going to be, and<br/>spell accordingly, or you spell according to the function, and let the<br/>tuning take care of itself.  You can&apos;t have it both ways.</p><p>(2) is simply demonstrated.  A diminished fifth is two minor thirds.  The<br/>characteristic tuning of a minor third is 6/5.  So, the characteristic<br/>size of a diminished fifth must be (6/5)^2=36/25, or 631 cents.  So, a<br/>diminished fifth is sharper than an augmented fourth.  This makes sense,<br/>as fifths in general are sharper than fourths in general.</p><p>Say you have a chord progression involving I, V, ii and V7.  For I, V and<br/>ii to be tuned to 5-limit intervals, and only 7 notes to be used (the<br/>simplest case) the 7 in V7 must be a ratio of 9/5.  If you want the 7 to<br/>be 7/4, 49 cents flatter, put a \ on the score.  Hence (3).  If the \<br/>isn&apos;t there, the performers can tune it however they want, which may not<br/>be what *you* want.  So tell them.  This will leave the tritone as a<br/>sub-diminished fifth, equivalent to an augmented fourth in meantone.</p><p>Such &quot;quartertone&quot; directions make it easier for the composer as well as<br/>the performers.  If you find yourself writing a progression where Bb\<br/>transforms into a plain Bb, you&apos;ll know there might be a nasty comma shift<br/>when it comes to be performed.  That way, even if the singers ignore the<br/>\, they&apos;ll find it easy to get right.  It should also remind you not to<br/>give the Bb to any piano or guitar accompaniment.</p><p>If you expect JI in performance, you could even try writing in the<br/>syntonic commas, with a schismic or 72= notation.  But even accurate<br/>meantone is a start.</p></div>
