<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>About the recent HE Convolution post</h1><h3><a id=95878 href="#95878">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2011 5:10:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I accidentally sent a pretty technical and only vaguely tuning-related<br/>post about how to quickly compute HE to the tuning list. I meant to<br/>send it to tuning-math, which is where an ongoing discussion about<br/>this has been taking place for the past week. I deleted it, but if you<br/>got it in your email and think it&apos;s interesting enough to want to<br/>respond, the tuning-math thread is here:</p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/18650">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/18650</a></p><p>Let&apos;s keep the discussion about it off of tuning until the work we&apos;re<br/>doing on it is done, at which point I&apos;ll be posting graphs, charts,<br/>minima, maxima, lists of all the triads with equivalent entropy to<br/>10:12:15, and whatever other random stuff we all want. Until then, if<br/>you actually are curious about what any of it means, feel free to<br/>check out the tuning-math thread above.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
