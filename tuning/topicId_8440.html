Diether de la Motte&apos;s _Harmonielehre_, a standard text in<br/>German conservatories and universities, is an excellent introduction to this<br/>tradition.  The scale-step notation based on roman numeral I through VII<br/>(sometimes with minor and major distinguished by small and capital letters)<br/>is more closely associated with Vienna. The two last deep exponents of<br/>scale-step harmonic theory were Schenker and Schoenberg, albeit with very<br/>different perspectives and results.</p><p>Perhaps the most critical question for us in the tuning community is whether<br/>the Riemannian traditions deals adequately with mediant tonal relations,<br/>that is, harmonies related to the fixed functional harmonies by thirds.<br/>Already with such scholars as Tanaka (before the turn of the 20th century),<br/>tonal space was represented two dimensionally, in triangulated lattices.<br/>Either of the assumed temperaments (meantone, 12tet) mapped the mediant<br/>functions simultaneously onto functions related to the tonic by chains of<br/>fifths, thus for many musicians the point may be somewhat moot.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
