I recently was<br/>&gt; was wondering about why the classical diatonic major<br/>&gt; and minor scales have the notes that they do, what<br/>&gt; principles define these scales, and so forth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did some reading and I invented some answers to some<br/>&gt; music theory questions that I did not find ready answers to,<br/>&gt; the result was the following brief online HTML paper and<br/>&gt; some java applets (e.g. Sethares&apos; dissonance curve, ...):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.austin.rr.com/jmjensen/musicTheory.html">http://home.austin.rr.com/jmjensen/musicTheory.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps some people here have thought through these issues<br/>&gt; before, and more deeply than I have?  I suspect so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would be interested in reading any comments that you might have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; regards,<br/>&gt; Jeff</p><p>Jeff, I quickly scanned your writing and found it very perceptive and<br/>curious. As a matter of fact, I have spent a good deal of time thinking<br/>about such matters. Whether or not your concerns are &quot;off topic,&quot; that is<br/>right where my head has been for the last two decades.</p><p>If you would like, I&apos;d be pleased to send you a complimentary copy of my<br/>book &quot;The Sounds of Music: Perception and Notation.&quot; I think you may find it<br/>interesting. If interested, email me at &lt;<a href="mailto:geskelin@stage3music.com">geskelin@stage3music.com</a>&gt; and give<br/>me the address to which you would like it sent.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div>
