It seems that the<br/>Chinese experienced the Turks long before Turks were in the Near East.  It is<br/>more documented than any pretense that Pythagorus had anything to do with<br/>spiraling fifths.  The Chinese early use of spiraling fifths is available<br/>from the tablature music for chin which is very specific.  Now Mongols, they<br/>prefer JI 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And since Pythagorus has no root connection with spirals of fifths,<br/>&gt; &gt;why presume he transported information on spiraling fifths to the<br/>&gt; &gt;Greek and Italian worlds?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point is that medieval Arabic theorists had studied the tunings<br/>&gt; of the Pythagoreans and based their ideas on that, and modern Turkish<br/>&gt; theory is based on medieval Arabic theory.</p><p>Paul, it is not like you to go by hearsay. The is no single point. Medieval<br/>(Islamic Iranians, rather than Arabic) theorists based ideas on the Greeks.<br/>But these have NOTHING to do with Pythagorus.  Maybe the Celts?  Turks<br/>actually believe that Sumerians were Turks.  Since Turks come out of Asia and<br/>have their early history with the Chinese, this is the most likely theory for<br/>the Turks, other than that they divined it on their own.  It has little to do<br/>with Arabic music other than the obvious instrument<br/>relationships/distinctions.</p><p>&gt; influences may very well have come from elsewhere, but the<br/>&gt; &quot;book<br/>&gt; learning&quot; associated with mathematical theories of tuning (which may<br/>&gt; have been very far removed from practice at various times) can be<br/>&gt; traced, I believe, to the ancient Greeks.

The Arabic<br/>theorists simply lengthened this chain, perhaps to justify scales<br/>already in use that didn&apos;t fit the Greek mold. There is<br/>circumstantial evidence that they stumbled upon the schisma (much as<br/>the West did later, around 1420), since they used it to construct,<br/>essentially, 5-limit just scales.</p></div>
