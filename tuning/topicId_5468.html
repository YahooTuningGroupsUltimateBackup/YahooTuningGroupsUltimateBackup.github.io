It was a<br/>good teacher who made me feel that exploring contemporary music was probably<br/>better than sliced bread, and, in North Carolina, I humbly believe I<br/>accomplished a bit of that through a radio program and an<br/>artist-in-residence program in the junior high schools. Untill the school<br/>bussing bruhahaha blew up our money pipeline, I toured all the junior highs<br/>in the county with a series of programs (along with poets, painters and<br/>dancers) and really got these kids fascinated. Then we bought a buncha<br/>cassette machines, loaned one to each kid and let them record any sound they<br/>liked, knowing that we&apos;d bring a mixer and a few tape machines in and, as<br/>per their inscructions, create collages. That&apos;s gotta be the wildest folk<br/>music this side of Stockhause.!<br/>Same goes for more esoteric-sound things like tunings. Start with the kids,<br/>let &apos;em at those cheap school guitars and such, let &apos;em add frets or take<br/>&apos;em away and all that. We tell our kids that freedom/liberty is what this<br/>country&apos;s about and then we feed them to the dog-ma.<br/>Well enough of that rant, but fact is, though I don&apos;t pretend to think that<br/>the majority of people will escape mediocrity, I do think the height of<br/>mediocrity could be raised gradually. But, we&apos;re in a quick-fix culture and<br/>that bodes ill. But I keep tryin&apos; cuz it&apos;s too interesting.</p></div>
