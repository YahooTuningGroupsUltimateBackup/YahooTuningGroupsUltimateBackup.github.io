In such a case, one can feel regret<br/>for the hurt they may cause. If this were the case here, I would feel<br/>concern for the hurt that you could have caused to many people on this list.<br/>Fortunately (for them) this is not the case here. I doubt if anything you<br/>have said has hurt anyone here because you are obviously so unhinged and in<br/>such mental pain that your words have nothing to do with the people you are<br/>supposedly addressing, and are really nothing but a cry for help. I do not<br/>know you or how you have arrived in this sad state, so there&apos;s not much I<br/>can do for you, except urge you to seek some help from some quarter,<br/>professional, spiritual, or otherwise. You are obviously headed down a dark,<br/>slippery slope which will bring suffering to noone but yourself in the long<br/>run. It is unfortunate because some of what you say in the few posts where<br/>you actually discuss music is of interest. You must tend to judge yourself<br/>very harshly for some reason, and then you project this judgment randomly<br/>and illogically at whoever happens to be in front of you. This much would be<br/>obvious to you if you could attain to any objectivity when it comes to your<br/>behavior. I am sorry to speak so bluntly, but your posts have long since<br/>gone over the line from being mearly quirky and curmudgeonly to being<br/>blatantly pathological. Perhaps you see yourself as a purveyor of &quot;tough<br/>love&quot;, hoping to inspire others to produce more music. If this is the case I<br/>don&apos;t think your approach will work very well, and besides too much of what<br/>you write is gratuitously insulting and cannot even pretend to be inspiring.<br/>If you want to encourage people, simple encouragement will probably work<br/>better. I am well aware that you will probably now turn your firehose of<br/>vitriol in my general direction, but all I can assure you of is that I am<br/>well aware of where it is really pointed and so I recommend that you not<br/>bother. You have already shot yourself in the foot what seems to be a record<br/>number of times, so perhaps you should give it a rest.</p><p>Dante</p></div>
