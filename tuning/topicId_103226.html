But in light of recent discussions about &quot;fields of attraction&quot;, I&apos;d like to bring it up again.</p><p>If you buy that intervals have fields of attraction based on simple ratios, does this mean that certain temperaments are &quot;unhearable&quot;?  Consider, for example, Dicot temperament.  In tempering out 25/24, we equate 6/5 with 5/4, and also two 6/5s (or two 5/4s) with 3/2.  However, right between 5/4 and 6/5, there is 11/9.  If the Dicot generator is right in the middle of 6/5 and 5/4, then it&apos;s obviously in the territory of 11/9.  Doesn&apos;t that mean that we are going to hear the interval &quot;as&quot; neither 6/5 nor 5/4, but &quot;as&quot; 11/9?  And that we are going to thus hear Dicot as a temperament where two 11/9s equal 3/2, or in other words a 2.3.11 temperament where 243/242 vanishes?  Perceptually-speaking, the two temperaments should be more or less identical (TOP dicot is &lt;1206.410, 350.456], TOP 2.3.11 243/242 is &lt;1200.064, 350.544]).  I&apos;ve always thought that this implies that only one of these two temperaments is musically &quot;real&quot;, as I don&apos;t really understand how anyone could differentiate between the two of them compositionally or as a listener.  I believe this is why Paul Erlich uses the term &quot;exo-temperament&quot; to describe temperaments like Dicot and Father.</p><p>But in any case, it seems that given the existence of &quot;fields of attraction&quot; (or &quot;fields of interaction&quot; to keep the &apos;Wad from crying havoc), for any set of temperaments whose generators are all sufficiently similar in tuning, there should be only one temperament mapping in the set that correctly describes the perception of music made in tunings derived from those temperaments.  Or, given some non-Just tuning, there should be only one temperament that describes correctly how that tuning will be heard.</p><p>The only exception to this I can think of is for tunings that locate a sufficient quantity of their notes between all plausible fields of attraction, in which case multiple temperament mappings will stand a chance of being accurate descriptors of perception.  However, I suspect these to be comparatively rare, and it seems like it might be worthwhile to weed out temperaments that will be &quot;heard as&quot; other temperaments, since they just make matters confusing (for instance, who can tell me how I could musically differentiate whether a tuning based on generators &lt;1200, 260] is Beep or Superpelog?  Seems like 27/25 and 135/128 are very different commas, yet throw 49/48 into the mix and suddenly you get two identical-looking tunings).</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=103229 href="#103229">ðŸ”—</a>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2012 4:52:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If you buy that intervals have fields of attraction based on simple ratios, does this mean that certain temperaments are &quot;unhearable&quot;?

What you said above<br/>about &quot;musical realness,&quot; &quot;the perception of music,&quot; &quot;compositional<br/>differentiation,&quot; &quot;accurate descriptors of perception&quot; are not things<br/>which follow from your limited definition of &quot;unhearable.&quot; This &quot;heard<br/>as&quot; thing so far has been given a very limited behavioral,<br/>non-psychoacoustic definition based on the somewhat musically sterile<br/>results of hypothetical lab experiments performed only with dyads.<br/>Once you start talking about these experiments determining &quot;musical<br/>realness,&quot; especially in a &quot;compositional&quot; sense, you need to make<br/>certain assumptions about how these (very limited) experiments with<br/>dyads apply to the big picture of music cognition that don&apos;t make<br/>sense to me at all.</p><p>An actual piece of music includes a number of phenomena which are<br/>perceptually relevant and sometimes poorly understood: tonal centers,<br/>the perception of a background mode or scale, chords that are quickly<br/>&quot;implied&quot; by snippets of arpeggiation and other things, etc. On the<br/>other hand, the experiments on which your definition is based involve<br/>giving people a set of dyads in isolation and telling them to retune<br/>them until they feel they&apos;re maximally &quot;in tune.&quot; This would seem to<br/>place a harsh limit of the applicability of these experiments to the<br/>bigger picture of music cognition in its broadest sense, and to make<br/>broad generalizations about overall musical perception from them would<br/>seem to paint an absurdly oversimplified picture of a musical<br/>composition.</p><p>These dyads aren&apos;t placed in any musically relevant temporal setting<br/>at all, nor placed in a setting where any of these other, poorly<br/>understood phenomena occur. They don&apos;t even test chords, for example.<br/>11/9 might not have a &quot;field of attraction&quot; under your definition at<br/>all, but how do we apply that to 8:9:10:11:12? And beyond obvious<br/>things like chords, these dyads weren&apos;t placed in any musically<br/>relevant temporal setting at all, nor placed in a setting where any of<br/>these other, poorly understood phenomena occur, etc.</p><p>Lastly, even in the ultra-limited sense of &quot;heard as,&quot; there might be<br/>tunings other than POTE that let you &quot;hear things&quot; in a dicot-tempered<br/>sense. Check out the 13p val, for example: with pure octaves, the<br/>dicot-tempered major chord is 0-369-730. 369 cents is probably enough<br/>for someone under strict laboratory conditions to retune to 5/4, and<br/>730 is probably enough for someone under strict laboratory conditions<br/>to retune to 3/2. So that would appear to be a dicot-tempered 4:5:6,<br/>with steps of 5/4-5/4 on the inside, and 3/2 on the outside.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103231 href="#103231">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2012 5:16:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jan 27, 2012 at 7:52 PM, Ryan Avella &lt;domeofatonement@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; If you buy that intervals have fields of attraction based on simple ratios, does this mean that certain temperaments are &quot;unhearable&quot;?

He&apos;s using it to<br/>refer to the results of &quot;free-retuning experiments&quot; where you give<br/>listeners a knob controlling the width of an interval, and you tune it<br/>to something random, and tell them to retune this interval until they<br/>feel it&apos;s maximally &quot;in tune.&quot; It&apos;s still not clear how these<br/>experiments really relate to something larger like a musical<br/>composition which has things like chords, tonal centers, temporal<br/>context, etc, nor how adaptation due to consistent bombardment with<br/>high-entropy music might change things (I definitely hear 11/8 much<br/>differently than when I started out, for instance).</p><p>I&apos;m still a little bit surprised at the results of these experiments,<br/>frankly. I should take a look at these Benade papers and see if they<br/>really make sense. For instance, say I took a bunch of &quot;unmusical&quot;<br/>listeners with no musical training and gave them a knob initially set<br/>to a tritone of some kind, and told them to retune it until it&apos;s<br/>maximally in tune. I&apos;d actually be quite surprised if they honed in on<br/>7/5 or something. Given the experimental conditions, I&apos;d expect them<br/>to make more dramatic changes in the sound and stop at something like<br/>3/2 or 4/3. But maybe not.</p><p>&gt; It is also really dependent on how we play those intervals as well.

It also seems like you&apos;re talking about interval<br/>recognition, where the beating for 350 cents would &quot;clue you in&quot; to<br/>that it&apos;s not the typical &quot;major&quot; third so you&apos;d call it &quot;neutral&quot;<br/>instead. I also think there are things other than 5/4 you might call<br/>&quot;major&quot; too.

There are a few ways I can think of doing it. For<br/>example, if you work out the probability distribution for an arbitrary<br/>point on the curve, the point which tends to have the highest<br/>probability is not, as a general rule, the nearest local minimum. But<br/>if your hypothesis is that someone will attempt to retune an interval<br/>so that the harmonic entropy drops, even if the dominant interval<br/>shifts, then that would imply that the minima are terminal points for<br/>these &quot;fields of attraction.&quot; But if that&apos;s what you&apos;re after, then<br/>the minima change depending on your &quot;s&quot; value, so for some s the<br/>nearest minimum to 11/9 is 5/4, and for other s the nearest minimum<br/>might be 11/9 itself.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not limiting myself just to the experiments Carl cited.

I make no<br/>inferences into the whole &quot;heard as&quot; thing beyond what was said. We<br/>seem to have very different viewpoints about how things work, so for<br/>communication&apos;s sake I&apos;m making no further assumptions beyond what<br/>you&apos;ve actually said.</p><p>You mentioned beatlessness. Well, I started off with a different<br/>approach: first I deliberately attempted to get someone to make a<br/>concrete statement about psychoacoustics, fields of attraction, &quot;what<br/>people like,&quot; and was unsuccessful. At one point, I attempted to<br/>define &quot;fields of attraction&quot; purely interms of psychoacoustic<br/>phenomena like beatlessness or virtual pitch clarity, but I was told<br/>that that&apos;s definitively not the correct interpretation of the<br/>concept. Instead, I was told to make no psychoacoustic assumptions at<br/>all, but to simply reduce everything to the way that people behave in<br/>certain, very limited experiments. And that&apos;s how I&apos;ve been<br/>interpreting your statements ever since.</p><p>Your post here now seems to be making a larger statement about the<br/>applicability of these experiments to music cognition, which is<br/>precisely the thing that nobody wanted to do before. So now, if you&apos;re<br/>making further assumptions now, particularly things that have to do<br/>with psychoacoustics, it would be helpful if you could state<br/>explicitly what they are.</p><p>&gt; Not all temperaments represent JI well, and if you imagine trying to adaptively intonate a temperament without losing the character of that temperament, that poses real challenges for temperaments like Bug, Dicot, and Father.

Part<br/>of the character of mavila is that everything is flat, which I think<br/>makes it sound nice and relaxing and chilled out. If I adaptively<br/>retune mavila, as Kalle did with a mavila comma pump today on XA, it<br/>doesn&apos;t sound flat anymore, so that this aspect of the sound has<br/>changed. To answer your question, I don&apos;t think that the adaptive<br/>mavila comma pump &quot;isn&apos;t mavila,&quot; nor do I think that mavila major<br/>chords don&apos;t have anything to do with 4:5:6, and I don&apos;t know of any<br/>sense I can think of in which mavila isn&apos;t real.</p><p>This would also imply that dominant temperament isn&apos;t real, because<br/>the tempered minor third represents multiple consonances: 6/5 or 7/6.<br/>I don&apos;t agree with that either.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Lastly, even in the ultra-limited sense of &quot;heard as,&quot; there might be<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings other than POTE that let you &quot;hear things&quot; in a dicot-tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; sense. Check out the 13p val, for example: with pure octaves, the<br/>&gt; &gt; dicot-tempered major chord is 0-369-730. 369 cents is probably enough<br/>&gt; &gt; for someone under strict laboratory conditions to retune to 5/4, and<br/>&gt; &gt; 730 is probably enough for someone under strict laboratory conditions<br/>&gt; &gt; to retune to 3/2. So that would appear to be a dicot-tempered 4:5:6,<br/>&gt; &gt; with steps of 5/4-5/4 on the inside, and 3/2 on the outside.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve thought of this before, too. Consider Dicot in 18-ED2, with triads 0-333.33-666.67; it&apos;s like your example, but for 6/5 instead of 5/4. What about Bug, though? Is there any tuning of Bug you can think of where the generator legitimately sounds like a 6/5, but the 4/3 still sounds like a 4/3?</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;sounds like&quot; a 6/5 here. To my f&apos;d up<br/>evil AP ears, minor thirds in Bug sound like minor thirds, and 4:5:6&apos;s<br/>in something like 9-EDO still sort of &quot;sound like&quot; 4:5:6.</p><p>If your question is specifically to find a tuning for Bug in which the<br/>tempered 6/5 dyad, by itself, would be freely retuned to 6/5 by the<br/>majority of listeners, and the 4/3 dyad would also be freely retuned<br/>as 4/3 by the majority of listeners, then I doubt it. But that still<br/>says nothing about those dyads when used in larger chords.</p><p>The average listener might retune 11/9 to something else, but that<br/>doesn&apos;t mean that 11/9 isn&apos;t &quot;real&quot; for them. There&apos;s still<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 chords.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103237 href="#103237">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2012 2:17:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, because in the lab experiments you talk about, 11/9 doesn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; its own &quot;field of attraction&quot; at all, I believe.</p><p>What lab experiments are these?

So now, if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; making further assumptions now, particularly things that have to do<br/>&gt; with psychoacoustics, it would be helpful if you could state<br/>&gt; explicitly what they are.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;m making any more assumptions than anyone else who believes that &quot;temperament&quot; is a meaningful concept.  Temperament is entirely based on the idea that you can take JI, mistune it by some amount, and still achieve a similar effect with the resulting intervals.  When we create temperament mappings, we are making an explicit list of which Just intervals our tempered intervals should be &quot;heard as&quot;--or, &quot;adaptively intoned as&quot; (same difference).</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by the &quot;character&quot; of a temperament.</p><p>It can be understood purely quantitatively.  I can&apos;t give you a hard cut-off, but if you have to substantially re-tune the intervals in the adaptation, you&apos;re probably losing the character of the temperament.</p><p>&gt; Part<br/>&gt; of the character of mavila is that everything is flat, which I think<br/>&gt; makes it sound nice and relaxing and chilled out. If I adaptively<br/>&gt; retune mavila, as Kalle did with a mavila comma pump today on XA, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t sound flat anymore, so that this aspect of the sound has<br/>&gt; changed. To answer your question, I don&apos;t think that the adaptive<br/>&gt; mavila comma pump &quot;isn&apos;t mavila,&quot; nor do I think that mavila major<br/>&gt; chords don&apos;t have anything to do with 4:5:6, and I don&apos;t know of any<br/>&gt; sense I can think of in which mavila isn&apos;t real.</p><p>Mavila&apos;s an inaccurate temperament, but it doesn&apos;t map intervals across fields of attraction.</p><p>&gt; This would also imply that dominant temperament isn&apos;t real, because<br/>&gt; the tempered minor third represents multiple consonances: 6/5 or 7/6.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t agree with that either.</p><p>In some temperaments, there are musical circumstances where one interval can sound like two separate consonances--in a dominant-tempered 4:5:6:7 chord, for instance, or a semaphore-tempered 6:7:8:9.  If you wanted to tune dominant temperament adaptively, you&apos;d tune 1/1-5/4-3/2-9/5 chords to 4:5:6:7, every time, no ambiguity.  That&apos;s how the temperament works.  I might even guess that most people confronted with 1/1-5/4-3/2-9/5 would say that 4:5:6:7 sounds like a smoother version of the same chord, suggesting that even if they&apos;re not *playing* in dominant temperament, they&apos;re still *hearing* in it.</p><p>But if you take the abstraction further, it gets thorny--what about minor triads?  Those would be problematic, from an adaptive standpoint, because dominant temperament equates 10:12:15 with 6:7:9.  How would you figure out which one to choose?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;sounds like&quot; a 6/5 here. To my f&apos;d up<br/>&gt; evil AP ears, minor thirds in Bug sound like minor thirds, and 4:5:6&apos;s<br/>&gt; in something like 9-EDO still sort of &quot;sound like&quot; 4:5:6.</p><p>If someone played you a minor triad in Bug temperament, and asked you to tweak it so it sounds in tune, would you tune it to 10:12:15, or 6:7:9?  The Bug minor 3rd is flat of a 6/5 by a huge amount, and flat of a 7/6 by much less.  I would say that unequivocally suggests that a minor triad in Bug should be adaptively intoned as a 6:7:9.  But if that&apos;s the case, then this isn&apos;t Bug temperament, it&apos;s 2.3.7 semiphore.  But then, if those wonky Bug major triads still sound like 4:5:6, and the minors sound like 6:7:9, well holy crap 36/35 just added itself to our comma list.  So we started from the abstraction of tempering out 27/25, but that perceptually &quot;implies&quot; 49/48 and 36/35, meaning that Bug does not exist as an independent entity and &quot;just is&quot; Beep...or rather, that Bug exists only as an abstraction and can&apos;t be realized in music.</p><p>Consider the following temperaments:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=1&limit=3&key=1_1">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=1&limit=3&key=1_1</a><br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=1b_1c&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=1b_1c&limit=5</a><br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=2c_1c&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=2c_1c&limit=5</a></p><p>They are all &quot;real&quot; in the abstract sense, and they all can produce tunings.  But is there any way at all that you can make music in them, such that the sounds you hear will sound like they are representing what the temperament mapping says they are representing?  If not, does that not mean that these temperaments are not &quot;real&quot; in the same sense that meantone is real?</p><p>This goes back to a conversation I had with Paul once.  I wanted to argue that 690 cents is not a meantone generator, because four of them gets you to 16/13 (360 cents) while eleven of them gets you to 5/4 (390 cents), and I thought it was ludicrous to ignore the better mapping for 5/4.  But Paul insisted, rightly so I think, that if I was playing major and minor triads in a 7-note MOS from the 690-cent generator, it would still be meantone because those 0-360-690 and 0-330-690 triads would still sound like they&apos;re representing 5-limit triads.  He then suggested that if, on the other hand, I used a bunch of 8:12:13 chords to pump the 1053/1024 comma, I could legitimately claim it wasn&apos;t meantone.  This blew my mind and I was kind of angry about it for a while and didn&apos;t want to believe it.</p><p>But the more I thought about it, the more sense it made.  Temperament is not tuning, and just because a tuning is derived from some temperament, doesn&apos;t mean it actually *is* that temperament.  A tuning can represent multiple things, no matter how it&apos;s derived, and it&apos;s only in music that those representations are &quot;called forth&quot;.  Temperaments are abstractions that can only be instantiated in tunings, and tunings are abstractions that are only instantiated in music.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=103245 href="#103245">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2012 9:26:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jan 28, 2012 at 12:06 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The other things you said don&apos;t follow from the assumptions you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; made, nor from your stated definition of how I should interpret your<br/>&gt; &gt; statements about hearing an interval as another interval.
