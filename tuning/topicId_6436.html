My ear demands<br/>&gt; everything, Bach included, in 7-limit tuning.  There, a tritone is<br/>&gt; something to be tuned, either as 7/5 or as 10/7, according to<br/>&gt; context.  In 5-limit, as I am slowly learning, a tritone is<br/>&gt; something to be subject to creative fudging, along with creative<br/>&gt; rationalizations about why it should be dissonant, yet we should<br/>&gt; still call this &quot;Just Intonation&quot;.</p><p>Please let me begin by warmly acknowledging that 7-limit tuning might<br/>artfully be applied to many kinds of music, and that if you like it,<br/>that is &quot;justification&quot; enough.</p><p>Further, as an aside to this thread, I would add that I have tried a<br/>15-note-per-octave 5-limit just intonation (JI) scheme based on a<br/>keyboard proposed by Zarlino which can be very pleasing for some<br/>16th-century vocal music, and inevitably involves comma shifts if a<br/>piece requires consonant fifths on both D-A and G-D. Of course, as an<br/>enthusiast for Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic style with its very deliberate<br/>shifts of a diesis (128:125 or ~41.06 cents in 1/4-comma meantone, or<br/>~38.7 cents in 31-tone equal temperament, 31-tet for short), I may<br/>hardly be the most selective listener to give an opinion on comma<br/>shifts &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>However, there are two possible implications of your last sentence I<br/>quote above which would raise some concerns for me as an advocate of<br/>medieval and Renaissance European styles of music and tunings,<br/>including 3-limit and 5-limit JI and meantone. In fairness, I would<br/>emphasize that here I deal mostly with very different periods than<br/>Bach, and touch on broader philosophical issues.</p><p>To assert my points in a positive manner, I would say:</p><p>(1) A musical style may quite legitimately choose to treat certain<br/>intervals as outright &quot;dissonances&quot; more or less urgently seeking<br/>resolution (e.g. the 729:512 tritone of 3-limit JI, or the 64:45<br/>tritone of 5-limit JI). This is not a mere matter of &quot;creative<br/>rationalizations,&quot; but a matter of artistic practice and expectation.<br/>Similarly, a musical style may quite legitimately treat certain<br/>intervals as &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities perceived as _relatively_<br/>blending but unstable, for example the Gothic major and minor thirds<br/>realized in 3-limit as 81:64 and 32:27.</p><p>(2) A JI system is not obliged to maximize the consonance of _all_<br/>intervals; it may either incidentally or quite deliberately accentuate<br/>the _dissonance_ or &quot;beatfulness&quot; of certain intervals.</p><p>In other words, while recognizing the validity of applying different<br/>adaptive tunings to historical pieces as a creative reinterpretation,<br/>I would want to keep an understanding also of the original tuning<br/>systems as reflections of the musical languages of these pieces.</p><p>From this viewpoint, realizing Machaut in 5-limit rather than 3-limit,<br/>or Monteverdi in 7-limit rather than 5-limit, is a creative exercise<br/>in blurring the concord/dual-purpose/discord spectrum of the music.<br/>Machaut with 5:4 major thirds, or Monteverdi with 7:4 minor sevenths,<br/>represents an interesting kind of &quot;overrealization,&quot; with a certain<br/>obscuring of the tension which an 81:64 in 3-limit or 9:5 in 5-limit<br/>would lend in keeping with musical contrasts of instability and<br/>stability.</p><p>Above all, I would urge that whether a tritone, for example, is taken<br/>as &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot; may be a matter of _musical style_ at<br/>least as much as tuning.</p><p>That is, in medieval, Renaissance, or Baroque music, a tritone is<br/>taken as unstable or &quot;dissonant&quot; regardless of whether it is realized<br/>as 729:512, 64:45, 10:7, or some irrational ratio of meantone or a<br/>well-temperament, etc., _because this is the way it is treated<br/>musically_.</p><p>Similarly, in Machaut, major and minor thirds are always unstable<br/>because that is the style of the music, whether the music is played in<br/>3-limit, 5-limit, meantone, 12-tet, etc.</p><p>Thus 3-limit JI &quot;fits&quot; the style of Machaut by lending beatfulness to<br/>intervals which are musically treated as &quot;_imperfect_ concords,&quot; and<br/>the rather complex ratio of the tritone in 5-limit JI &quot;fits&quot; the<br/>dissonant character of this interval in Renaissance music.</p><p>Of course, this &quot;classic&quot; approach of fitting the acoustical nuances<br/>of the tuning to the concord/dual-purpose/discord spectrum of the<br/>music suggests a very interesting question: what if we deliberately<br/>try a certain &quot;mismatch&quot; between tuning and musical structure, so that<br/>certain dual-purpose sonorities or even outright discords have their<br/>acoustical consonance or &quot;beatlessness&quot; maximized?</p><p>Such creative experiments may produce beautiful music, and fall under<br/>a wider category of what the great theorist Joseph Yasser called<br/>&quot;hybridization.&quot;</p><p>However, the fact that 7-limit JI _can_ be applied to music in styles<br/>or &quot;languages&quot; suggesting 5-limit JI or some approximation<br/>(e.g. meantone, well-temperaments) by no means vitiates the musical<br/>logic of the original tunings.</p><p>Rather, one might call a 7-limit tuning applied to such music as a<br/>form of &quot;Mannerism,&quot; that is, a creative distortion of the classic<br/>tuning in order to achieve a new effect. As someone who takes this term<br/>as a compliment applied to some of my favorite music (e.g. the _Ars<br/>subtilior_ or &quot;subtler art&quot; of the late 14th century, and the late<br/>16th-century madrigal), I would emphasize the positive connotations this<br/>term carries for me.</p><p>Please note that I speak here in nonexclusive terms: in asserting that<br/>the original historical tunings are &quot;right,&quot; I don&apos;t mean to suggest<br/>that other alternatives are in any sense wrong, only that the original<br/>tunings indeed fit the musical languages in question.</p><p>While my own focus is mainly on medieval and Renaissance music, I<br/>would add one comment about at least some keyboard works of Bach: here<br/>the subtly graduated scale of tension, or &quot;acoustical dissonance,&quot;<br/>afforded by performance in a period well-temperament is indeed an<br/>expressive feature which neither a JI rendition (7-limit or otherwise)<br/>nor meantone can provide.</p><p>Again, this isn&apos;t at all to exclude such alternative realizations, for<br/>example Bach in 7-limit JI or in 31-note meantone with pure major<br/>thirds or in 31-tet, only to recognize the special advantages of the<br/>likely historical realization.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
