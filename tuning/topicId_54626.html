Here is a list of some enharmonic bridges, and<br/>some approximate 8/7 intervals deriving from them:</p><p>200/189 27/25<br/>28/27 32/27<br/>36/35 10/9<br/>525/512 75/64<br/>64/63 9/8<br/>875/864 125/108<br/>126/125 144/125<br/>225/224 256/225<br/>5120/5103 729/640<br/>65625/65536 9375/8192<br/>4375/4374 2500/2187</p><p>On 31-et, for instance, 126/125 and 225/224, which are commas of<br/>7-limit 31et, lead to 144/125 and 256/225 as approximate 8/7s, which<br/>are represented by 6 steps of 31-equal, the correct note for 8/7 in<br/>31-equal. So we look for the 6 and for differences of 6 on your<br/>lattice diagram; it is a 5-limit interval, but under 31 it maps to<br/>8/7. On your diagram there is a 6 corresponding to 144/125, the<br/>126/125-bridge 8/7, and a 25=31-6 corresponding to 225/128, the<br/>225/224-bridge 7/4. Similarly on the 171et lattice you can spot the 33<br/>which corresponds to 2500/2187, and gives you an 8/7, and also see<br/>that the block is aligned in this direction, so that you&apos;d get a lot<br/>of highly accurate 7-limit intervals by a planar tempering, using<br/>4375/4374, of this block.</p><p>&gt; these lattices were made with the copy of the Tonalsoft<br/>&gt; Musica software which i have on my computer.  it gives<br/>&gt; you folks some idea of the lattice-drawing capabilities<br/>&gt; of the software.</p><p>Leading to the question of when it is to be released.
