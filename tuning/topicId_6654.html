It&apos;s all in the service of the art.</p><p>I agree. I think that various instrumentations bring out different aspects<br/>of a composition.</p><p>&gt;   As far as Debussy and guitar, I hate to be vague, but it seems I read<br/>&gt;once where Debussy was supposed to meet with a certain classical<br/>&gt;guitarist to get some insights into writing for the instrument....the<br/>&gt;guitarist, unfortunately, never showed up, and Debussy died shortly<br/>&gt;thereafter...maybe someone knows the details of this story.</p><p>Can anybody provide more information?</p><p>&gt;I love Girl w/Flaxen Hair on guitar, and play in in the key of G.</p><p>Christopher Parkening plays it in the same key. His recording of the piece<br/>is outstanding, and provided many ideas for my interpretation, but which I<br/>am proud to say (and I hope you&apos;ll agree when you hear my CD) it doesn&apos;t<br/>come close to the performance that Raissa Dorff and I did at Saint Peter&apos;s<br/>Church.</p><p>John Link</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal quintet,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill Evans, Ennio and<br/>Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl Zindars.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p></div>
