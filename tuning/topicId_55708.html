Maybe I can present these<br/>so that everyone can join in.</p><p>A triangular number is a number of the form<br/>1 + 2 + ...<br/>e.g.<br/>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.</p><p>The formula for the nth triangular number<br/>is n (n+1) / 2</p><p>So for instance, the fifth triangular number<br/>is 5 (5+1) / 2 = 15.</p><p>So Gene&apos;s observation is that<br/>1 + 1/(1+2) + 1/(1+2+3) + ...<br/>adds up to 2.</p><p>Of course you can&apos;t add up infinitely many<br/>terms so what you do is to add up a finite<br/>number at a time. That&apos;s the sequence of<br/>partial sums as it is called.</p><p>Then writing tri(n) for n(n+1)/2, you find out that<br/>1 + 1/tri(1) + 1/tri(2) + .. + 1/tri(n)<br/>= 2 - 2/n</p><p>Well that is true for the first term:</p><p>1 = 2 - 1/1</p><p>You could go on and prove it for the second<br/>term, then the third and so on but we<br/>have infinitely many terms to prove it for,<br/>so some shortcut is needed to get a finite<br/>proof.</p><p>The way you prove these types of results<br/>is by what mathematicians call mathematical<br/>induction. You work out a method for<br/>getting from the result for n to the<br/>result for n+1.</p><p>So, given that</p><p>1 + 1/tri(1) + 1/tri(2) + .. + 1/tri(n)<br/>= 2 - 2/n</p><p>which we already know for n = 1<br/>you need to show that</p><p>1 + 1/tri(1) + 1/tri(2) + .. + 1/tri(n+1)<br/>= 2 - 2/(n+1)</p><p>To prove that you need to show that<br/>2 - 2/n + 1/tri(n+1)<br/>= 2 - 2/(n+1).</p><p>If you work that out with a bit of algebraic<br/>manipulation, you will find that it isn indeed<br/>the case, and this proves the result for all n.</p><p>Another way of writing 2 - 2/n is as<br/>2(n-1) / n</p><p>So the partial sums are</p><p>4/3, 6/4, 8/5, 10/6, 12/7, 14/8, 16/9, ...</p><p>(4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 12/7, ...)</p><p>which gets closer and closer to 2.<br/>In fact as n gets larger, it will get as close<br/>as you like to 2, and will never exceed it.<br/>That&apos;s what a mathematician means if they<br/>say that a series sums to 2.</p><p>Then you can also make an infinite product working backwards<br/>- products are more relevant for ratios as you multiply<br/>them rather than add, so</p><p>4/3 * (3/2 / (4/3) ) *(8/5 / (3/2) ) * (10/6 / (8/5) ) * (12/7 / (10/6) ) ...</p><p>gives us the same numbers as the ratios on top and<br/>bottom cancel, so e.g.</p><p>4/3 * (3/2 / (4/3) ) *(8/5 / (3/2) ) * (10/6 / (8/5) ) * (12/7 / (10/6) )<br/>= 12/7</p><p>Multiplying out the numbers within the brackets, that&apos;s</p><p>4/3 * 9/8 * 16/15 * 25/24 * 36/35 * ...</p><p>which multiplies out to the same numbers and again gets closer<br/>and closer to 2.</p><p>Obviously the next term in the product will be 49/48<br/>then 64/65 then 81/80 - with the square numbers on the top.</p><p>It works because</p><p>2(n)/(n+1) / (2(n-1) / n)</p><p>= n^2 / (n^2 - 1)</p><p>..................</p><p>Actually this may well make an interesting infinite scale for a fractal<br/>tunes.</p><p>I have an option in Fractal Tune Smithy already to make geometric series scales<br/>based on equal temperament to play in, e.g.<br/>0 cents 1200 cents 1800 cents 2100 cents 2250 cents 2325 cents 2362.5 cents 2381.25 cents,...<br/>with each interval half the previous one.</p><p>It is done by entering e.g.</p><p>#g 1/2<br/>for the scale</p><p>= each interval half the previous.</p><p>(see Scales | Special notations in the help).</p><p>However, one could easily follow the same idea with just intonation intervals and have<br/>1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...<br/>=<br/>3/2 7/4 15/8 31/16 ...</p><p>and this triangular numbers one and<br/>while at it I may as well let the user<br/>specify any formula they like in n.</p><p>so<br/>#j 2/(n(n+1))<br/>would make 1 + 1/tri(1) + 1/tri(2) + ..<br/>maybe I can allow use of 1/tri(n) as an abbreviation there.</p><p>Then<br/>#j 1/2^n<br/>would make 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...</p><p>I&apos;ll give it a go and see if it comes up with<br/>something interesting to listen to.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2004 5:39:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jjensen142000&quot; &lt;jjensen14@h...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; other relevant journals are &quot;Music Theory Spectrum&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;Music Analysis&quot;, and &quot;19th Century Music&quot; usually has<br/>&gt; good analytical papers as well.<br/>&gt;</p><p>thanks; I&apos;m going to have to do some more browsing at the library.</p><p>[snip]<br/>&gt; i say &quot;conscious&quot; because, especially in pop music,<br/>&gt; microtonality is already ubiquitous ... but the performers<br/>&gt; generally aren&apos;t aware of any of the theory of it.</p><p>Any pop songs that I know?

The two are connected via logarithms,<br/>being really two forms of the same thing. In this case we have a<br/>convergent sequence whose nth term is 2-2/n, and we can take<br/>differences and get (2-2/(n+1))-(2-2/n) = 1/(n(n+1)/2), or we can take<br/>ratios and get (2-2/(n+1))/(2-2/n) = n^2/(n^2-1).

I don&apos;t know to what extent the work of Harry Partch is<br/>&gt; &gt;     taught in music schools.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my experience (undergrad level), only in the &quot;Techniques of<br/>early 20th century<br/>&gt; composers.&quot;  Not in the theory classes, not in music history...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, not a single time in my entire time in theory classes and<br/>history classes, was tuning<br/>&gt; ever even mentioned!  For an issue that dominated the theory and<br/>practice of music for a<br/>&gt; vast majority of history, I find it strange.  It makes you want to<br/>subscribe to Partch&apos;s view<br/>&gt; of &quot;the tyranny of equal temperment&quot; or whatever.  Are we living in<br/>musical &quot;1984&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for the OT rant :)  I&apos;m preaching to the choir I guess.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Chris</p><p>***I mentioned this a while ago, but actually I was exposed to Harry<br/>Partch&apos;s theories at the University of Michigan.  It was in a<br/>composition seminar hosted by composer Leslie Bassett.  One of the<br/>composers in the class was from the University of Illinois and I<br/>believe he either studied with Partch or with some of his disciples.<br/>In any case, I saw the book _Genesis..._ and we went through some of<br/>the theories in the class.  It seemed pretty strange to me at the<br/>time (say 1978...) but I could see there was concrete thinking and<br/>detail behind these ideas, and I took away a respect for them... (I<br/>don&apos;t remember if we played much of the music though... but we must<br/>have... :)</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
