They were sort of &quot;headliners&quot; at the performance stage for<br/>the evening, bringing a taste of New York to the otherwise serene upper<br/>midwest.  The music was full of wild electronic noise, guitar feedback,<br/>and, yes, lots of clanging microtonal piano sounds (performed on<br/>synthesizer).  My perception of it kept veering between &quot;serious<br/>contemporary music&quot; to noisy rock bands like Sonic Youth or Pere Ubu.<br/>Glorious stuff!  I only talked to them very briefly afterward and did not<br/>get any sense of what kind of tuning was used, or whether there was any<br/>system to it.</p><p>Also, Harold Fortuin and I played a couple of numbers earlier in the<br/>evening, including Harold&apos;s twisted 22ET arrangement of &quot;Bali Hai&quot; and his<br/>new arabic-inspired piece using a fractional ET of<br/>27-point-something-notes-per-octave.</p><p>kp</p></div>
