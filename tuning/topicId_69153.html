I do know that it sounds *different* (less clearly profiled) when heard on synthesizer, and I&apos;ve heard quite a few samples of that in various timbres.</p><p>Most recently, I&apos;ve listened to all the MIDI-piano samples at Ross Duffin&apos;s new demo page:<br/><a href="http://music.cwru.edu/duffin/Norton/Letter.html">http://music.cwru.edu/duffin/Norton/Letter.html</a><br/>To me, there, it sounds easily confusable with equal temperament: but with the proviso that it has added depth to the expression (or steroids, or MSG, or what-have-you analogy)...more *presence*.  The Gershwin and Brahms there certainly sound right and natural to me!  :)</p><p>It also sounds that way to me on Ronald Brautigam&apos;s recording of Beethoven sonatas using it, and on Robert Hill&apos;s forthcoming disc of WF Bach, both on fortepiano: like &quot;I-can&apos;t-believe-it&apos;s-not-equal&quot; but with the crucial added depth to it.  And on somebody&apos;s concert recording they sent me, playing Schumann&apos;s chamber music with it on a Bosendorfer...hard to pick out that it&apos;s not equal, other than the &quot;presence&quot;, the stronger harmonic focus.</p><p>In my own recording of Brahms chorale preludes, on organ, it&apos;s much more obvious than it is on fortepiano.  No chance there of confusing it with equal...or with any of the temps that I called &quot;workmaster shape&quot; in my paper.</p><p>When I first heard the recording of two- and three-harpsichord concertos, by Bach, in the new Brilliant Classics set: I recognized right away that they had used my temp, even though it says so nowhere, and even though I had no notice from any of the players.  I picked it straight up from the sound.  So, I contacted one of those players to confirm, and he said yes: they&apos;d used it...and he didn&apos;t know that the recording was already released, at that point!  :)  Details of the recording here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/recordings.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/recordings.html</a></p><p>A couple of weeks ago I put on somebody&apos;s 1987 recording of various Bach harpsichord works.  I recognized right away that they had used Werckmeister III (recognizing this mostly from my visceral response that the music is made so ugly...!), even though the booklet merely says &quot;a historical temperament&quot;.  I took lessons for five years, regularly, in a teacher&apos;s studio where the harpsichord was almost always in Werckmeister III for all purposes...I got to know its quirks very well, although I never warmed to it.  And I always insisted on using not-WIII for my own various solo recitals there at that school.</p><p>&gt; &gt;     I&apos;m get suspect of all the large claims people make about various WTs<br/>&gt;     when the first thing that happens when I propose an actual _hardcore_<br/>&gt;     listening test is that people start back-pedalling and making excuses<br/>&gt;     as to why they wouldn&apos;t be able to hear such-and-such an effect. It&apos;s<br/>&gt;     like you can *feel* people getting nervous about making a mistake<br/>&gt;     publicly!</p><p>Well, that&apos;s certainly understandable.</p><p>&gt;     As for upper partials, like I said, we don&apos;t have to go realistic--a<br/>&gt;     sawtooth timbre on a synth is great for upper partials, and they&apos;re<br/>&gt;     perfectly harmonic like on a harpsichord. I dont see why you wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;     take the challenge---one certainly hears the differences between<br/>&gt;     temperaments, all else being equal. The question is, could we identify<br/>&gt;     our favorite from among them, randomly? I too prefer acoustic music,<br/>&gt;     but c&apos;mon, let&apos;s not hide our bold claims behind hot air about<br/>&gt;     synthesized tones.<br/>&gt; &gt;     I&apos;m willing to bet the farm that anyone who took the time to actually<br/>&gt;     tune a harpsichord or organ to Brad&apos;s satisfaction (or Johnny&apos;s or<br/>&gt;     whoever&apos;s) in the comparison set I proposed would still experience the<br/>&gt;     same general result---if they are confused by synthesized tones, they<br/>&gt;     will be also confused by acoustic ones.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Also, the reverse I think would be true--if it&apos;s easy to recognize<br/>&gt;     synthetically, it would be easy acoustically (assuming of course that<br/>&gt;     amazingly accurate acoustic tuning was done).</p><p>I agree with that: that the synthesizer (in some timbres anyway) masks things that are obvious on harpsichord and organ.  So do pianos and fortepianos.  I&apos;ve had our church&apos;s piano (Yamaha) in my temp since summer 2005, and I play all sorts of stuff on it.  It always sounds smoother than the results I get at home on three harpsichords, even though the temp is the same.  The timbre makes that much difference.</p><p>Is it possible that I&apos;d personally slip up in a synthesizer listening test?  Yes, of course.  But, as I mentioned yesterday, I believe the process of testing temperaments should be not merely a listening session, but also crucially *playing in* them on appropriate acoustic instruments, to experience what the intonation does to one&apos;s intuitive responses as a player.  And, setting them up entirely by ear to see how they play out in that experiential process, since Bach would have had to do so similarly: no electronic shortcuts.  That&apos;s why I sit here<br/>patiently setting up *all* of the Neidhardts etc, by ear, to experience what they do in the music, and what they do as to giving a reasonably logical tuning *process* hands-on.  I believe there&apos;s no substitute for doing these things, but again, maybe I&apos;m a curmudgeon.</p><p>My by-ear instructions for some of the Neidhardts, et al, are here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/practical.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/practical.html</a><br/>Once their strategy is figured out, they&apos;re nowhere near as hard as they might look on paper.  Just lay down the basic 1/6 comma naturals, and then start adjusting things here and there.</p><p>Brad Lehman<br/><a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a></p></div>
