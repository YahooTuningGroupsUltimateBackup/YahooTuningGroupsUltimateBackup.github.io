Rothenberg predicts an increase in some sort of<br/>&quot;confusion&quot; which occurs with the intelligibility of melodies,<br/>particularly when transposed, if you tune this MOS to an &quot;improper&quot;<br/>variant (L/s &gt; 2/1) vs a proper one. Let&apos;s call this &quot;impropriety<br/>confusion.&quot; (Let&apos;s just not consider scales with only one &quot;s&quot; interval<br/>per period right now, which can never be improper no matter how you<br/>tune them.)</p><p>Given that, I&apos;m curious how many of you agree with this statement: For<br/>any MOS of the form xLys, impropriety confusion is increased as y<br/>increases and x decreases; e.g. improper 2L5s is more noticeable than<br/>improper 3L4s is more noticeable than improper 4L3s is more noticeable<br/>than improper 5L2s.</p><p>From a mathematical standpoint this seems trivial to me, because the<br/>extremes for any MOS of the form xLys will be x-EDO and (x+y)-EDO. So<br/>if you&apos;re at 1L6s, then your options are 1-EDO and 6-EDO - and it&apos;s a<br/>long way till you get to 1-EDO. And if you&apos;re at 2L5s, your options<br/>are 2-EDO and 7-EDO, and there&apos;s a lot of opportunity for impropriety<br/>as you get towards 2-EDO. But if you&apos;re at 5L2s, then your options are<br/>5-EDO and 7-EDO, which isn&apos;t nearly as bad.</p><p>For example, consider magic[7] vs mohajira[7], which are some good<br/>temperaments for improper vs proper 3L4s respectively. To my ears, the<br/>shift between these two is noticeable and dramatic. They barely sound<br/>like the same scale at all. The &quot;major seconds&quot; in magic[7] sound like<br/>there&apos;s a &quot;hole&quot; in them or something, they sound like they should be<br/>thirds or fourths or something, comparatively speaking. I can<br/>immediately tell that two &quot;minor seconds&quot; put together forms an<br/>interval much smaller than the &quot;major second.&quot; For mohajira[7], this<br/>isn&apos;t the case.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2011 2:12:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>OK, one more thing that&apos;s also important. In the last message, I noted<br/>that the &quot;major seconds&quot; in magic[7], which are 6/5, sound like they<br/>have a &quot;hole&quot; in them, or that there&apos;s a space where a whole bunch of<br/>minor seconds could fit.</p><p>I also note that in something like 19-equal, the amount of minor<br/>seconds that could fit is definitely more than 2, which means that<br/>there&apos;s some sort of super-impropriety in which a perceived chain of<br/>three minor seconds stacked together is even still much smaller than<br/>the major second. Another way to put this is that in 19-equal, not<br/>only is magic[7] improper, but magic[10] is improper as well. My brain<br/>seems to easily pick up on this.</p><p>However, I notice the same exact thing for augmented[6] in 12-edo:<br/>those 6/5 &quot;major seconds&quot; seem to take a huge amount of space up, such<br/>that my brain can easily tell that more than two minor seconds fits<br/>into the space of each major second. This scale, however, is proper.<br/>On the other hand, both 5L2s and 6L1s sound more or less proper to me<br/>unless you tune them so severely that s almost vanishes. That is, I<br/>perceive the proper 3L3s as being more analogous to the improper 3L4s<br/>than either proper 5L2s or improper 5L2s.</p><p>I&apos;m curious if this perception is shared by anyone else. -Mike</p></div>
