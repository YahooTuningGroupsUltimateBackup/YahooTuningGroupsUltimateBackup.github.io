I have a little unfinished experimental material to show for it:</p><p>MIDI: <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese-retuned.mid">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese-retuned.mid</a><br/>PDF score: <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.pdf">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.pdf</a><br/>Lilypad source: <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.ly">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.ly</a></p><p>...but I found myself not finding this to be different enough from 12-TET to matter. It has a mildly different character from 12-TET, and I even retuned it in John O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s Blue Just tuning to see a greater difference in character. But I didn&apos;t feel like I was really writing non-twelve material. (I say this knowing that the lousy MIDI rendering on my PC may have something to do with it.)</p><p>So I asked myself what I wanted in order to &quot;feel like I was doing microtonality&quot;. Then I thought I should use this as an example of tempering, if anyone&apos;s willing to spend the time on it.</p><p>I like the three minor thirds I&apos;ve been playing with recently: 7/6 (266 cents), 13/11 (289), and 6/5 (316). I wanted to be able to play around with more than one minor third per chord in the I, IV, and V chords of the scale. I also wanted a 12-note scale so I could play in Lilypad.</p><p>That says I should have these intervals:<br/>I:<br/>1/1<br/>7/6<br/>13/11<br/>6/5<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>2/1</p><p>IV:<br/>4/3 * 1/1 =    4/3<br/>4/3 * 7/6 =   14/9<br/>4/3 * 13/11 = 52/33<br/>4/3 * 6/5 =    8/5<br/>4/3 * 4/3 =   16/9<br/>4/3 * 3/2 =    2/1</p><p>V:<br/>3/2 * 1/1 =    3/2<br/>3/2 * 7/6 =    7/4<br/>3/2 * 13/11 = 39/22<br/>3/2 * 6/5 =    9/5<br/>3/2 * 4/3 =    2/1<br/>3/2 * 3/2 =    9/4 = 9/8</p><p>Sort and de-duplicate to get:</p><p>    1 / 1<br/>    9 / 8<br/>    7 / 6<br/>   13 / 11<br/>    6 / 5<br/>    4 / 3<br/>    3 / 2<br/>   14 / 9<br/>   52 / 33<br/>    8 / 5<br/>    7 / 4<br/>   39 / 22<br/>   16 / 9<br/>    9 / 5<br/>    2 / 1</p><p>If I understand the way this works, I&apos;ve selected intervals from the 2.3.5.7.13/11 subgroup, which is a five-dimensional tuning space. Is that a bad idea? If so, why?</p><p>This scale&apos;s not proper, but I&apos;m not sure why that matters, so I&apos;m ignoring that for now.</p><p>I have too many intervals: I want a 12-note scale. So I&apos;ll probably have to eventually pull out one of the minor thirds. I lean toward leaving in the 7/6 and the 6/5 because they&apos;re farther apart and therefore easier to hear; also, by removing the 13/11 from the tuning space, I collapse one dimension. That said, I&apos;m open to suggestions.</p><p>Now, I&apos;m open to tempering this scale, but I&apos;m not sure whether I should. What benefit would I gain?</p><p>Here are some of the possible commas to temper. There may well be more, since I&apos;m just eyeballing this. I&apos;m including all three minor thirds, just in case something interesting pops up. I&apos;m also including the intervals that these commas equate, even though I know (as Mike said before) people may generally not care about that when they choose temperaments.</p><p>7093/7085, 2 cents<br/>   difference between 4 9/8s and one 8/5<br/>   difference between 5 9/8s and one 9/5</p><p>352/351, 4.9 cents<br/>   difference between 3 4/3s and one octave + 13/11<br/>   difference between 4 4/3s and one octave + 52/33</p><p>81/80, 21.5 cents<br/>   difference between 4 4/3s and one octave + 8/5</p><p>1029/1024, 8.4 cents<br/>   difference between 3 7/4s and two octaves + 4/3<br/>   difference between 4 7/4s and three octaves + 7/6</p><p>1410/1409, 1.2 cents<br/>   difference between 5 9/5s and four octaves + 13/11</p><p>But now I&apos;m lost. Why would I choose any particular one of these commas to temper?</p><p>7093/7085 doesn&apos;t seem very interesting, because those are the same equivalences I get with 12-EDO (4 whole tones makes m6, C-Ab; 5 whole tones makes m7, C-Bb).</p><p>I&apos;m guessing that by tempering 352/351, I could formally eliminate the 13/11 and 52/33 intervals, while still getting them functionally in the scale; that makes that comma interesting, if I want to keep the 13/11 intervals and drop the 7s.</p><p>1029/1024 seems to make it possible to do interesting things with stacks of harmonic sevenths, which sounds pretty cool.</p><p>But those are just guesses.</p><p>Is there a way to do the tempering without knowing Maple? The xenwiki EDO pages don&apos;t say what commas they temper, unfortunately, because if it did I could choose EDOs that temper those commas and then select the closest value for each note in the scale. I don&apos;t know how to do the TOP computations to see which one gives the smallest level of distortion, but I should at least be able to get something workable. Would that be a reasonable approach, if I knew which EDOs temper which commas?</p><p>Does anyone have any thoughts on whether / how to temper this? Or on interesting commas I missed?</p><p>Am I even close to doing this right? Is it remotely interesting? :)</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=97075 href="#97075">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2011 8:58:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 7093/7085, 2 cents<br/>&gt;     difference between 4 9/8s and one 8/5<br/>&gt;     difference between 5 9/8s and one 9/5</p><p>This is actually 32805/32768, the schisma.

If you are doing these approximations deliberately, you shouldn&apos;t: when tempering, it&apos;s crucial you use the exact comma, and not an approximation.</p><p>&gt; But now I&apos;m lost. Why would I choose any particular one of these commas<br/>&gt; to temper?</p><p>That would depend on what you want to do with it all.</p><p>&gt; 7093/7085 doesn&apos;t seem very interesting, because those are the same<br/>&gt; equivalences I get with 12-EDO (4 whole tones makes m6, C-Ab; 5 whole<br/>&gt; tones makes m7, C-Bb).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m guessing that by tempering 352/351, I could formally eliminate the<br/>&gt; 13/11 and 52/33 intervals, while still getting them functionally in the<br/>&gt; scale; that makes that comma interesting, if I want to keep the 13/11<br/>&gt; intervals and drop the 7s.</p><p>This equates the Pythagorean minor third, 32/27, with 13/11, and makes a pretty good fit with the schisma.

The easiest way would be to go here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/">http://x31eq.com/temper/</a></p><p>And in particular the &quot;unison vector search&quot; page.</p><p>The xenwiki<br/>&gt; EDO pages don&apos;t say what commas they temper, unfortunately, because if<br/>&gt; it did I could choose EDOs that temper those commas and then select the<br/>&gt; closest value for each note in the scale.</p><p>If you want to temper 352/351, 1029/1024 and 32805/32768, just feed these into the maw of Graham&apos;s machine. This cuts rank six down to rank three. If you wanted rank two, guiron, the 41&amp;77 temperament, suggests itself. 118et is pretty much unbeatable for 13-limit guiron, so a quick answer to your question would be &quot;temper in 118&quot;. However, I&apos;m not sure why you are choosing the commas you do. 118et does not temper out 81/80, which I doubt you want to do anyway in the light of the rest of your commas, but also not 650000/649539. If you add the latter to 351/350, 1029/1024 and 32805/32768, you get a perverse variation of guiron, so I&apos;d just stick to guiron and 118, by the way.</p></div><h3><a id=97076 href="#97076">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2011 9:11:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was playing around with Canton, which Gene posted recently.

Keep in mind that the goal of tempering is to<br/>increase the consonance of a scale, so this is not a bad thing.</p><p>Here&apos;s an exercise to try that may prove useful: go to 22-tet or<br/>27-tet and load up the superpyth aeolian scale. Superpyth refers to a<br/>scale in which the fifths are sharp, such that four of them is<br/>tempered to make an octave-equivalent 9/7, as opposed to the more<br/>common 5/4. Three fourths makes an approximate 7/6. So in a sense,<br/>it&apos;s kind of like a 7-limit version of meantone.</p><p>Now load up a superpyth aeolian scale and play around for a while and<br/>see if it sounds radically different from meantone aeolian. Try<br/>comparing the version in 27-tet, which has almost pure 7/6&apos;s, to the<br/>version in 19-tet, which has almost pure 6/5&apos;s.</p><p>You can probably detect the difference in that the 6:7:9 chords are a<br/>bit more serene and restful sounding (at least that&apos;s how I hear them,<br/>anyway) - but in another sense the scale sounds &quot;the same.&quot; That is,<br/>it&apos;s microtonal, kind of, but it doesn&apos;t sound like some completely<br/>new, original, xenharmonic, novel sound that breaks from tradition.<br/>(And for the record, I don&apos;t find that the pajara scales sound that<br/>way either).</p><p>Now load up machine[11] in 17-tet and play 4:7:9:11, and transpose it<br/>up and down the scale. That probably sounds completely different. Yes<br/>it does.</p><p>If you want something different, in my experience, the best way to<br/>trigger that is to start by finding scales that produce different<br/>&quot;puns,&quot; as it were.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=97078 href="#97078">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2011 1:21:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Mar 15, 2011 at 9:57 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...but I found myself not finding this to be different enough from<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-TET to matter.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s an interesting scale, and Gene&apos;s given some good suggestions to<br/>&gt; temper it further.</p><p>Personally, I found it lovely, and I hope Jake finishes his piece.</p></div><h3><a id=97081 href="#97081">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2011 7:13:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s an interesting scale, and Gene&apos;s given some good suggestions to<br/>&gt; temper it further.</p><p>Bear in mind I already gave an opinion on tempering canton.scl here:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/cantonpenta">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/cantonpenta</a></p><p>The point of tempering out 364/363, if you recall, was to make a 14/11 third and a 13/11 third come to a fifth.

Look at 31-odd limit diamond with<br/>Scala, it&apos;s interesting. I wonder if it&apos;s possible to evoke 23:29<br/>(401.303 cents) with some 12-equal voicing, probably not.</p><p>Kalle</p></div>
