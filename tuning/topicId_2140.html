The triangular lattice can<br/>&gt; represent multiple factors on a single rung,<br/>&gt; the rectangular lattice cannot.  This is true no<br/>&gt; matter what is going on with the 2&apos;s, as far as<br/>&gt; I can see.  For example, 7/5 is one rung in a<br/>&gt; triangular lattice whereas it is two rungs on a<br/>&gt; rectangular one.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if this has any bearing on what you&apos;re asking,<br/>but thought it should be pointed out.</p><p>Inasmuch as all the different lattices and tonal systems<br/>we have been considering with this topic are based on<br/>an implicit assumption of a 1/1, they are all Monophonic<br/>(in the Partchian sense), and therefore *ALL* ratios<br/>are in one sense theoretically one rung away from 1/1.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;joe_monzo@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/1999 10:48:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Erlich:]<br/>&gt; 7:4 and 5:4 are each three rungs in the rectangular<br/>&gt; lattice, but they still come out a litle simpler<br/>&gt; than 7:5 since the rungs along the 2-axis are so short.</p><p>&gt; Ah, I see where you&apos;re coming from... and this should<br/>&gt; make calculating things easy by use of prime factorization.</p><p>Does this mean you guys are coming around to rectangular?<br/>It sounds like we&apos;re all beginning to meet.</p><p>In regard to Paul&apos;s statement that &quot;the rungs along the<br/>2-axis are so short&quot;, see the cover of Xenharmonikon 6,<br/>Erv Wilson&apos;s logarithmic harmonic spiral diagram.  This<br/>is truly one of Erv&apos;s most amazing visual models.</p><p>I was staring at it the other day while also reading Erlich&apos;s<br/>long (and excellent!) posting on/quoting of Terhardt,<br/>and thinking about some of the things I&apos;ve posted here<br/>recently about the role of tonalness in calculating or<br/>representing tri-and-higher-adic harmony, and I thought<br/>it useful to imagine a prime-lattice of the type I use,<br/>with a harmonic spiral appearing for each local 1/1<br/>as it occurs in the music.  The lattice would combine<br/>the rectangular/triangular prime structure with, theoretically,<br/>a harmonic spiral associated with each lattice-point.</p><p>[Keenan:]<br/>&gt; I have to agree that for purposes of predicting<br/>&gt; dyadic dissonance, prime factorisation is pointless.</p><p>Just so that we&apos;re clear on this, I agree with this too.</p><p>I&apos;m just not that interested in dyads - I&apos;m trying to<br/>formulate theories about larger musical structures.</p><p>Dave, your post is a great summary on musical complexity!</p><p>&gt; 200:250:300 Hz&#x9;<br/>&gt; interval complexity (period)&#x9;<br/>&gt; 4:5      4/200Hz = 20ms&#x9;<br/>&gt; 5:6      5/250Hz = 20ms&#x9;<br/>&gt; 2:3      2/200Hz = 10ms&#x9;<br/>&gt;&#x9;<br/>&gt; 200:240:300 Hz&#x9;<br/>&gt; interval complexity (period)&#x9;<br/>&gt; 4:5      4/240Hz = 16.67ms&#x9;<br/>&gt; 5:6      5/200Hz = 25ms&#x9;<br/>&gt; 2:3      2/200Hz = 10ms&#x9;</p><p>Now, this is something worth quoting!</p><p>I thought it worthwhile to look at the ratios of the<br/>complexity periods within these chords - that seems<br/>to explain better than anything why the otonal chord<br/>sounds so much more &quot;consonant&quot; (I&apos;m almost afraid to<br/>use the damn word now!) than the utonal.&#x9;</p><p>It was also interesting to see how these ratios were<br/>reflected in the ratios of the intervals themselves.</p><p>The otonal chord presents no need of real calculating:<br/>the ratios of its complexity periods are 1:2, 1:1, and 1:2.<br/>Interestingly, these ratios do not reflect at all on<br/>the complexity of the actual numbers of the interval ratios.</p><p>The utonal chord presents a scenario which is, however,<br/>much more . . . complex  :)</p><p>There&apos;s a 3:2 relationship between the complexity periods<br/>of the 4:5 and 5:6 intervals - the 5s, one a numerator and<br/>the other a denominator, cancel, and numerator 6 and<br/>denominator 4 are reduced in half.</p><p>There&apos;s a 5:3 ratio between the complexity periods of<br/>the 4:5 and 2:3 - these numbers are in both numerators.</p><p>And there&apos;s a 5:2 ratio between the complexity periods<br/>of 5:6 and 2:3 - these numbers are in both denominators.</p><p>Would the scientists please explain what this means?<br/>if anything?</p><p>[Keenan:]<br/>&gt; Now this is the hard part; taking account of<br/>&gt; tolerance in chords.</p><p>I suggest that everyone be very cautious about disallowing<br/>the relevance of prime-factorization when they embark on this<br/>task.  I&apos;m convinced that it plays a major part when<br/>considering pitch-sets of more-than-two distinct notes.</p><p>-monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
