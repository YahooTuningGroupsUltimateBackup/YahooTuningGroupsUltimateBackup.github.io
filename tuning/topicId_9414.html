All your retuned MIDI files sound infinitely better to me than<br/>&gt;they did before due to this change.   Don&apos;t know how much it would cost<br/>&gt;you to get one.</p><p>Well... my home computer (a Dell, purchased in mid 1999) also has a<br/>built-in Yamaha DS-XG!  The piano sound is a lot better than some I&apos;ve<br/>heard, quite sweet, and it does show off the reduced-beat advantages of<br/>retuning very well.  Perhaps I shouldn&apos;t complain, but, to my ear, it<br/>doesn&apos;t sound like a &quot;real&quot; piano.  I wonder if you have a different<br/>flavor of DS-XG; there&apos;s little or no doc with mine.</p><p>I also have a software version of Roland&apos;s Sound Canvas, called VSC-88,<br/>which some on this list like just fine, but others think bites the big<br/>one (perhaps it&apos;s not necessary to avoid naming names, but the opinions<br/>were offered in off-list correspondence); to my ear, there is a rough<br/>white noise in bass notes that is excessive.  I bought another software<br/>package, GigaSampler LE, with GigaPiano, but it seems my 400 MHz, 64MB<br/>RAM PC is not powerful enough for it!  It supposedly samples a pampered<br/>Yamaha grand piano with several samples for EACH note, which sounds (on<br/>paper) real good; just wish I could hear it without horrible pops!</p><p>Then I have my old Korg M1, which has a fairly good piano voice, but<br/>can&apos;t receive General MIDI sequences, and I haven&apos;t written the code<br/>to shoehorn a retuned sequence down to 8 channels.</p><p>One thing seems very clear: tastes vary on what makes a good synthesized<br/>piano sound at LEAST as much as on what makes for good tuning!</p><p>I&apos;m thinking of trying to reverse-engineer the waveforms out of the<br/>GigaPiano, which doesn&apos;t support non-real-time synthesis.  The maker,<br/>Nemesys, has NOT impressed me with their &quot;support&quot;: two working days to<br/>respond to a simple question, with an answer to a different question!<br/>It comes with no printed doc, and the on-line help, instead of having<br/>hyper-links, makes references to &quot;Chapter 3, page 49&quot;, an obvious and<br/>nearly worthless transcription of some hardcopy they&apos;re too cheap to<br/>ship any more.</p><p>In sending out informal demo CD&apos;s, I&apos;m torn between the DS-XG and the<br/>VSC-88.  Continued suggestions are welcome!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
