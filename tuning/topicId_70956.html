He&apos;s not sure if the tool is loading Scala files<br/>directly - he&apos;s not a microtonal musician so it would be difficult for<br/>him to test whether or not a tuning loaded from a .scl file sounds<br/>correct.  Frankly, I don&apos;t have enough microtuning experience myself<br/>to pick out tuning errors either, but I decided to help anyway. I<br/>decided use MIDI files of Bach pieces for my testing because that&apos;s<br/>what people here seem to use to audition tunings.</p><p>Where I need some help in testing is in the area of tunings that<br/>specify an average of more than 12 notes/octave or are otherwise<br/>significantly removed from Meantone. For example, the Bach piece that<br/>sounds good with the Meantone-tuned test patch on the synth sounds<br/>drastically different with the Fokker-tuned test patch - it sounds<br/>like a completely different piece, thus defeating the purpose of<br/>auditioning a new tuning with that piece. It&apos;s because of the<br/>remapping of the MIDI Note Number values - under the Fokker tuning, up<br/>to 5 octaves of a standard piano/organ style keyboard map to a single<br/>octave.</p><p>Any ideas for testing these more extreme tunings? Do folks just work<br/>with 12-note subsets of the test tunings? Or do people just send bug<br/>reports on their Scala-loading synth if it doesn&apos;t sound right wither<br/>their chosen tuning?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=70957 href="#70957">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2007 7:10:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;paolovalladolid&quot; &lt;phv40@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Where I need some help in testing is in the area of tunings that<br/>&gt; specify an average of more than 12 notes/octave or are otherwise<br/>&gt; significantly removed from Meantone.
