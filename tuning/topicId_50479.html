My soon to be in-laws are antique dealers and they found me a completely<br/>cherry 193x Ukelin --half ukelele half violin (replete with a wasps nest in one of the<br/>sound holes from where someone had attached it to a wall.</p><p>i have been tuning it for about three days it has 16 &apos;melody&apos; strings and 4 chords.<br/>that can be plucked. i had this fantasy as i was playing it that i would wake the wasps<br/>in the soundhole. The bowing of the steels make this instrument sound very eerie.<br/>likeys.</p><p>Patrick Pagano<br/><a href="http://www.digitalworlds.ufl.edu">http://www.digitalworlds.ufl.edu</a><br/><a href="http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT">http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT</a></p></div>
