The 8th<br/>harmonic is three octaves...) above it. The eighth sounds like a badly out<br/>of tune major scale with an extra note, the sixth sounds like a messed-up<br/>(but in tune) blues scale, and the seventh sounds downright peculiar. The<br/>ninth and twelfth also sound interesting.</p><p>My thought was that anything written in JI could also be played in a<br/>Harmonic Series tuning, by simply multiplying each ratio by their lowest<br/>common denominator so they&apos;re all integers. Thus the Swanee River in JI<br/>&quot;5/4-9/8-1/1-5/4-9/8-1/1-2/1-5/3-2/1&quot; becomes in Harmonics<br/>&quot;30-27-24-30-27-24-48-40-48&quot;. This results not in the fundamental being the<br/>tonic, but rather the most southwestern pitch on the lattice. There, I have<br/>single-handedly bridged the widening gap between JI and Harmonic Series<br/>Tuning! (not really)</p><p>Stay tuned,<br/>    Keenan Pepper</p></div>
