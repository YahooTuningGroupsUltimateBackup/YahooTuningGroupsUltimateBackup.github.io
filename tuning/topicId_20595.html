I know that our traditional 12-tET scale is<br/>&gt; included in it, but what are the other advantages in terms of<br/>&gt; sonorities again??  I know it is a very flexible scale and very<br/>&gt; popular in Boston at the moment.</p><p>I laid it out on a spreadsheet (just like anyone could)<br/>and at first glance, I see many kinds of near-just thirds.<br/>Mostly only +/- 2 or 3 cents away from popular just thirds.</p><p>24tet is a subset (quarter tones!), and 72tet has some intervals<br/>real close to 36tet, so 6th tone neutral thirds are there too.</p><p>Very interesting...too bad I don&apos;t have time to investigate<br/>any further today.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div>
