Well, basically the idea is that the simpler<br/>a given interval is, i.e. the octave, the fifth, the more it is both<br/>sensitive to mistuning and likely to extend a wider field of<br/>attraction that leads one to hear other nearby intervals as mistuning<br/>of itself.</p><p>The little model i&apos;ve worked on tries to give a given frequency<br/>interval a rough (but still numerical) lower and upper limit--how<br/>flat and sharp a given interval can be before it crosses into another<br/>interval&apos;s space and is liable to be either an ambiguity or a<br/>misidentified simpler ratio.

The model says no, that the median,<br/>the 14/11 for instance, will most likely be misidentified as a 9/7<br/>interval space rather than a 5/4 interval space; though the model<br/>predicts that this median&apos;s lower limit would share the 5/4&apos;s upper<br/>limit.</p><p>2) the model predicts that the space between thirds, the neutral<br/>third, perhaps even the 11/9 itself, is a clearly defined space.<br/>Interestingly, the model predicts that the median space between an<br/>8/7 and a 7/6 is no less defined than the far more common median<br/>interval spaces of the 11/8 and the 13/8. According to the model the<br/>15/13 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/6 by approximately the same<br/>amount the 11/8 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/5 and the 13/8&apos;s<br/>lower limit overlaps the 8/5&apos;s upper limit. So the question here is<br/>how does that measure to people&apos;s ears.is the median space between<br/>an 8/7 and a 7/6 as independently valid a space as that the 11/8 and<br/>the 13/8 share with their simpler neighbors?</p><p>3)According to the model, the 1/1 manifests a field of attraction so<br/>strong and a shadow so long that there is a state of ambiguity all<br/>the way to the 11/10, 10/9 range.

So what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly is the idea...? Well, basically the idea is that the<br/>&gt; simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a given interval is, i.e. the octave, the fifth, the more it is<br/>&gt; both<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive to mistuning and likely to extend a wider field of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; attraction that leads one to hear other nearby intervals as<br/>&gt; mistuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of itself.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The little model i&apos;ve worked on tries to give a given frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval a rough (but still numerical) lower and upper limit--how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; flat and sharp a given interval can be before it crosses into<br/>&gt; another<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval&apos;s space and is liable to be either an ambiguity or a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; misidentified simpler ratio. However, i use the word ratio here<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; caution, as i think what i&apos;m really looking for is an interval<br/>&gt; space<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; occupied by some interval that is not in the magnetic field of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; attraction of its neighbor.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To me the math model i&apos;m using looks good, so long as it&apos;s seen in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximate terms as opposed to fixed boundaries. However, i&apos;d<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to ask people here with an interest in this sort of thing to give<br/>&gt; me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; their own input based solely on their ears...okay, so with that in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mind here are a few of the questions i&apos;d like to ask of anyone who<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; might be interested enough to answer:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) if you were to allow that the 5/4 and 9/7 occupy completely<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; independent interval spaces, is there a space in-between that<br/>&gt; won&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; be confused for either of these? The model says no, that the<br/>&gt; median,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the 14/11 for instance, will most likely be misidentified as a 9/7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval space rather than a 5/4 interval space; though the model<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; predicts that this median&apos;s lower limit would share the 5/4&apos;s<br/>&gt; upper<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; limit.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) the model predicts that the space between thirds, the neutral<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; third, perhaps even the 11/9 itself, is a clearly defined space.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, the model predicts that the median space between an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 8/7 and a 7/6 is no less defined than the far more common median<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval spaces of the 11/8 and the 13/8. According to the model<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 15/13 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/6 by approximately the<br/>&gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; amount the 11/8 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/5 and the 13/8&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lower limit overlaps the 8/5&apos;s upper limit. So the question here<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how does that measure to people&apos;s ears&iuml;&iquest;<a href="http://½.is">½.is</a> the median space<br/>&gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an 8/7 and a 7/6 as independently valid a space as that the 11/8<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the 13/8 share with their simpler neighbors?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)According to the model, the 1/1 manifests a field of attraction<br/>&gt; so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; strong and a shadow so long that there is a state of ambiguity all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the way to the 11/10, 10/9 range. The 2/1 similarly back to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19/10, 17/9 range, and the 3/2 all the way back to the 10/7 and<br/>&gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the way up to the 11/7 space. How does this stand up ? remember,<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; model is not so much saying here&apos;s the line where an interval<br/>&gt; space<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; definitively changes as it is saying here&apos;s the area where<br/>&gt; ambiguity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; coalesces into a defined area of recognition .and all this is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat outside the usual connotations of the perceived<br/>&gt; complexity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or simplicity of a specific given ratio----&gt;in other words, an<br/>&gt; 11/9<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; might be the simplest ratio to define a neutral third, but<br/>&gt; whether or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not that&apos;s THE interval is somewhat besides the point in<br/>&gt; comparison<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the question of whether this is an independently articulated<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval space outside the field of attraction imposed by the long<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; shadows of its neighbors.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Simple, rule-of-thumb measures for appraising a given ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; complexity, like N*D ,et al., might not hold up so well.<br/>&gt; why?,well,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if the model has anything to say in this regard it clearly says<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an interval space such as the 16/9 are uniquely articulated<br/>&gt; whereas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval spaces such as the 11/8 and the 13/8 are not. Are<br/>&gt; complexity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; spikes more the result of where we sit in the octave/interval<br/>&gt; space,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or are they more the result of a given ratio&apos;s complexity?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, there&apos;s a lot more and I&apos;m only tapping the surface of a<br/>&gt; thing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that might or might not be valid to begin with anyway....but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the way questions work if they&apos;re not rhetorical anyway, right?<br/>&gt; Well<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; please feel free to contribute any inputs, I am interested!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; TIA- <a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a> &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a> &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2008 3:54:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>With the cautionary caveat that the ratio names are not as important<br/>as the approximate position they occupy in the confines of the<br/>octave&apos;s pitch-continuum, according to this algorithm, the only<br/>interval-spaces that occupy their own territory and neither abut, nor<br/>overlap another&apos;s are the following:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/5okqxp">http://tinyurl.com/5okqxp</a></p><p>However, a more inclusive view is one that allows for shared<br/>boundaries as is the case with the 11/10 and the 10/9, the 7/5 and<br/>the 10/7, the 11/7 and the 8/5 and the 17/9 and the 19/10:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/6ans6r">http://tinyurl.com/6ans6r</a></p><p>As I mentioned earlier, if we were to include such common JI<br/>intervals as the 11th and 13th harmonic, then the algorithm would<br/>suggest that the median space between the 8/7 and the 7/6, the 15/13-<br/>space, is no less of an independent peak positioned between two<br/>stronger fields of attraction:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/6dccru">http://tinyurl.com/6dccru</a></p><p>I&apos;ve always been somewhat of a pantheist when it comes to tuning<br/>systems, so the idea of an absolute tuning hierarchy is one at odds<br/>with my nature. Yet, Just Intonation&apos;s relation to the human auditory<br/>system is a benefit seldom lost on anyone who navigates their<br/>instrument&apos;s tuning by their ear but whoever told Nebraska policeman<br/>Herbert Schirmer that &quot;Someday, Watchman, you will see the universe&quot;;<br/>be it himself, some semi-autonomous exponent of himself, or some<br/>intervening Other, I think it&apos;s interesting to acknowledge the idea<br/>that experiences not only give us memories and events, but they also<br/>sometimes give us answers. And unfortunately, it&apos;s often an<br/>uncomforting fact that our answers are disproportionately taken as<br/>the basis on which we&apos;re judged. When Hermann Helmholtz wrote his<br/>epic, On the Sensations of Tone, he was a real-time contributing<br/>editor to the blossoming, golden age of reason. So it&apos;s no surprise<br/>he prefaces his work with a lot of rational, raison d&apos;&ecirc;tre directed<br/>at the expense of arbitrary assumption. But tuning theory has always<br/>sat on a fence, uncomfortably straddling the dueling influences of a<br/>new religion and a new science. Oddly, both draw on the tools of the<br/>other in such a fashion that their mutual disregard is both puzzling<br/>andgiven the peculiar way these things workpredictable.</p><p>For as long as I can remember I&apos;ve been interested in art and music<br/>and math, but I&apos;m neither an artist nor a musician and certainly not<br/>a mathematician. I&apos;ve always felt that skill was an end to a mean,<br/>not an end in itself. This is a simple thing to say, and everyone<br/>seems to say it too but I tend to see it as in exaggerated terms<br/>where your skills only have to be good enough to execute the contents<br/>of your imagination, but your imagination has to good enough to say<br/>something worth saying and animate all the intuition and imaginative<br/>possibilities we innately posses and continually foster. Like<br/>everyone, I tend to exaggerate along the lines of our interests, and<br/>I&apos;ve always been a dreamer who likes to spend his time trying to make<br/>little models out of the leftover pieces of those dreams. It&apos;s a<br/>skill I suppose, but certainly not the formal moving part of a<br/>normative science. There&apos;s a short scene in Ingmar Bergman&apos;s movie<br/>The Seventh Seal where Death is asked &quot;what he knows&quot;, and &quot;he knows<br/>nothing&quot; is his answer. Bergman himself tends to fall in and out of<br/>favor precisely because he asked these kinds of questions and wasn&apos;t<br/>afraid to answer.</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this does seem to be the case, that &apos;basically , the simpler ratios<br/>we<br/>&gt; seem to notice the mistuning quicker.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know if this is because we are a somewhat &apos;simpler ratio&apos;<br/>culture.<br/>&gt; For me it brings up the question is why we hear things as thirds or<br/>&gt; fourths which are even broader generalizations before tuning even<br/>takes<br/>&gt; place.<br/>&gt; It might all be influenced by the scale we were brought up with.<br/>but<br/>&gt; maybe not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; my own theory.<br/>&gt; It seems this has to do with the range in which the difference<br/>tones<br/>&gt; falls in terms of octaves and then basic ranges within. compare<br/>basic<br/>&gt; intervals.<br/>&gt; these are appoximate depending on your ratios<br/>&gt; semitones 4 octave lower<br/>&gt; whole tones 3 octave lower<br/>&gt; minor thirds 2 octaves and a fifth to a minor third +/-<br/>&gt; major thirds 2 Octaves<br/>&gt; fourth 1 octave and a fifth<br/>&gt; fifth I octave<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt; It appears there are thresholds of intervals some clearer than not.<br/>&gt; for instance we can see how the 5/4 is probably the rounded lower<br/>limit<br/>&gt; if what we might hear as a major third with the difference tone<br/>being 2<br/>&gt; octave below. above this we hear as major , below moving toward a<br/>&gt; neutral maybe more quickly. even though 9/7 is not that much more<br/>&gt; distant than 11/9 from 5/4, there might be more of a tolerance for<br/>one<br/>&gt; direction over the other. sharp octaves over flat ones. which would<br/>play<br/>&gt; into why we have a name for neutral thirds but none for sharp major<br/>ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To &apos;quantify&apos; such things might work well when submitting papers,<br/>but i<br/>&gt; prefer to look at the beast for what it is, &apos;cloudy&apos; in a very<br/>Popper<br/>&gt; like manner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria<br/>&lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; hi Kraig, when i say &quot;sensitive to mistuning&quot; i simply mean that<br/>your<br/>&gt; &gt; ear&apos;s going to notice when the octave is slightly mistuned more<br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt; your ear&apos;s going to notice when the 19/10 is mistuned, no?<br/>Anyway, i<br/>&gt; &gt; only put my imagination in numbers not my faith, so worry not my<br/>&gt; &gt; friend....anyways, any thoughts on the specific just-o-ramic<br/>interval<br/>&gt; &gt; questions i asked...?in your case i&apos;d be extra interested as your<br/>&gt; &gt; ear&apos;s been on them longer than most.<br/>&gt; &gt; daniel<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;,<br/>Kraig<br/>&gt; &gt; Grady &lt;kraiggrady@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would say the models are wrong.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i am not sure if Ehrlich&apos;s theory treats the octave as being<br/>more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive to mistuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought he treated it equally. i don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i have yet to hear examples of these ideas in chords spread out<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple octaves.

Well, basically the idea is that the<br/>&gt; &gt; simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a given interval is, i.e. the octave, the fifth, the more it<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; both<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive to mistuning and likely to extend a wider field of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attraction that leads one to hear other nearby intervals as<br/>&gt; &gt; mistuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of itself.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The little model i&apos;ve worked on tries to give a given<br/>frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval a rough (but still numerical) lower and upper limit--<br/>how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flat and sharp a given interval can be before it crosses into<br/>&gt; &gt; another<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval&apos;s space and is liable to be either an ambiguity or a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misidentified simpler ratio. However, i use the word ratio<br/>here<br/>&gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caution, as i think what i&apos;m really looking for is an interval<br/>&gt; &gt; space<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occupied by some interval that is not in the magnetic field of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attraction of its neighbor.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To me the math model i&apos;m using looks good, so long as it&apos;s<br/>seen in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approximate terms as opposed to fixed boundaries. However, i&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to ask people here with an interest in this sort of thing to<br/>give<br/>&gt; &gt; me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their own input based solely on their ears...okay, so with<br/>that in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind here are a few of the questions i&apos;d like to ask of<br/>anyone who<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might be interested enough to answer:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) if you were to allow that the 5/4 and 9/7 occupy completely<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; independent interval spaces, is there a space in-between that<br/>&gt; &gt; won&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be confused for either of these? The model says no, that the<br/>&gt; &gt; median,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 14/11 for instance, will most likely be misidentified as<br/>a 9/7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval space rather than a 5/4 interval space; though the<br/>model<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predicts that this median&apos;s lower limit would share the 5/4&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; upper<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limit.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) the model predicts that the space between thirds, the<br/>neutral<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; third, perhaps even the 11/9 itself, is a clearly defined<br/>space.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, the model predicts that the median space<br/>between an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8/7 and a 7/6 is no less defined than the far more common<br/>median<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval spaces of the 11/8 and the 13/8. According to the<br/>model<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 15/13 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/6 by approximately the<br/>&gt; &gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amount the 11/8 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/5 and the<br/>13/8&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lower limit overlaps the 8/5&apos;s upper limit. So the question<br/>here<br/>&gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how does that measure to people&apos;s ears.is the median space<br/>&gt; &gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an 8/7 and a 7/6 as independently valid a space as that the<br/>11/8<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 13/8 share with their simpler neighbors?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)According to the model, the 1/1 manifests a field of<br/>attraction<br/>&gt; &gt; so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strong and a shadow so long that there is a state of<br/>ambiguity all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way to the 11/10, 10/9 range. The 2/1 similarly back to<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 19/10, 17/9 range, and the 3/2 all the way back to the 10/7<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way up to the 11/7 space. How does this stand up ?<br/>remember,<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; model is not so much saying here&apos;s the line where an interval<br/>&gt; &gt; space<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitively changes as it is saying here&apos;s the area where<br/>&gt; &gt; ambiguity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coalesces into a defined area of recognition .and all this is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat outside the usual connotations of the perceived<br/>&gt; &gt; complexity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or simplicity of a specific given ratio----&gt;in other words, an<br/>&gt; &gt; 11/9<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might be the simplest ratio to define a neutral third, but<br/>&gt; &gt; whether or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not that&apos;s THE interval is somewhat besides the point in<br/>&gt; &gt; comparison<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the question of whether this is an independently<br/>articulated<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval space outside the field of attraction imposed by the<br/>long<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shadows of its neighbors.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Simple, rule-of-thumb measures for appraising a given<br/>ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complexity, like N*D ,et al., might not hold up so well.<br/>&gt; &gt; why?,well,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the model has anything to say in this regard it clearly<br/>says<br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an interval space such as the 16/9 are uniquely articulated<br/>&gt; &gt; whereas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval spaces such as the 11/8 and the 13/8 are not. Are<br/>&gt; &gt; complexity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spikes more the result of where we sit in the octave/interval<br/>&gt; &gt; space,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or are they more the result of a given ratio&apos;s complexity?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, there&apos;s a lot more and I&apos;m only tapping the surface of a<br/>&gt; &gt; thing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that might or might not be valid to begin with anyway....but<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way questions work if they&apos;re not rhetorical anyway,<br/>right?<br/>&gt; &gt; Well<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; please feel free to contribute any inputs, I am interested!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TIA- <a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a><br/>&lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a> &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2008 5:17:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>btw, for anyone who&apos;s interested Robert Walker made a nice applet<br/>awhile back based on another aspect of this algorithm/concept here:</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/japplets/uo_non_oct.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/japplets/uo_non_oct.htm</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the cautionary caveat that the ratio names are not as<br/>important<br/>&gt; as the approximate position they occupy in the confines of the<br/>&gt; octave&apos;s pitch-continuum, according to this algorithm, the only<br/>&gt; interval-spaces that occupy their own territory and neither abut,<br/>nor<br/>&gt; overlap another&apos;s are the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5okqxp">http://tinyurl.com/5okqxp</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, a more inclusive view is one that allows for shared<br/>&gt; boundaries as is the case with the 11/10 and the 10/9, the 7/5 and<br/>&gt; the 10/7, the 11/7 and the 8/5 and the 17/9 and the 19/10:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6ans6r">http://tinyurl.com/6ans6r</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I mentioned earlier, if we were to include such common JI<br/>&gt; intervals as the 11th and 13th harmonic, then the algorithm would<br/>&gt; suggest that the median space between the 8/7 and the 7/6, the<br/>15/13-<br/>&gt; space, is no less of an independent peak positioned between two<br/>&gt; stronger fields of attraction:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6dccru">http://tinyurl.com/6dccru</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always been somewhat of a pantheist when it comes to tuning<br/>&gt; systems, so the idea of an absolute tuning hierarchy is one at odds<br/>&gt; with my nature. Yet, Just Intonation&apos;s relation to the human<br/>auditory<br/>&gt; system is a benefit seldom lost on anyone who navigates their<br/>&gt; instrument&apos;s tuning by their ear but whoever told Nebraska<br/>policeman<br/>&gt; Herbert Schirmer that &quot;Someday, Watchman, you will see the<br/>universe&quot;;<br/>&gt; be it himself, some semi-autonomous exponent of himself, or some<br/>&gt; intervening Other, I think it&apos;s interesting to acknowledge the idea<br/>&gt; that experiences not only give us memories and events, but they<br/>also<br/>&gt; sometimes give us answers. And unfortunately, it&apos;s often an<br/>&gt; uncomforting fact that our answers are disproportionately taken as<br/>&gt; the basis on which we&apos;re judged. When Hermann Helmholtz wrote his<br/>&gt; epic, On the Sensations of Tone, he was a real-time contributing<br/>&gt; editor to the blossoming, golden age of reason. So it&apos;s no surprise<br/>&gt; he prefaces his work with a lot of rational, raison d&apos;&ecirc;tre directed<br/>&gt; at the expense of arbitrary assumption. But tuning theory has<br/>always<br/>&gt; sat on a fence, uncomfortably straddling the dueling influences of<br/>a<br/>&gt; new religion and a new science. Oddly, both draw on the tools of<br/>the<br/>&gt; other in such a fashion that their mutual disregard is both<br/>puzzling<br/>&gt; andgiven the peculiar way these things workpredictable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For as long as I can remember I&apos;ve been interested in art and music<br/>&gt; and math, but I&apos;m neither an artist nor a musician and certainly<br/>not<br/>&gt; a mathematician. I&apos;ve always felt that skill was an end to a mean,<br/>&gt; not an end in itself. This is a simple thing to say, and everyone<br/>&gt; seems to say it too but I tend to see it as in exaggerated terms<br/>&gt; where your skills only have to be good enough to execute the<br/>contents<br/>&gt; of your imagination, but your imagination has to good enough to say<br/>&gt; something worth saying and animate all the intuition and<br/>imaginative<br/>&gt; possibilities we innately posses and continually foster. Like<br/>&gt; everyone, I tend to exaggerate along the lines of our interests,<br/>and<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always been a dreamer who likes to spend his time trying to<br/>make<br/>&gt; little models out of the leftover pieces of those dreams. It&apos;s a<br/>&gt; skill I suppose, but certainly not the formal moving part of a<br/>&gt; normative science. There&apos;s a short scene in Ingmar Bergman&apos;s movie<br/>&gt; The Seventh Seal where Death is asked &quot;what he knows&quot;, and &quot;he<br/>knows<br/>&gt; nothing&quot; is his answer.

Well, basically the idea is that the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a given interval is, i.e. the octave, the fifth, the more<br/>it<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; both<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive to mistuning and likely to extend a wider field of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attraction that leads one to hear other nearby intervals as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mistuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of itself.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The little model i&apos;ve worked on tries to give a given<br/>&gt; frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval a rough (but still numerical) lower and upper<br/>limit--<br/>&gt; how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flat and sharp a given interval can be before it crosses<br/>into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; another<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval&apos;s space and is liable to be either an ambiguity or<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misidentified simpler ratio. However, i use the word ratio<br/>&gt; here<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caution, as i think what i&apos;m really looking for is an<br/>interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; space<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occupied by some interval that is not in the magnetic field<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attraction of its neighbor.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To me the math model i&apos;m using looks good, so long as it&apos;s<br/>&gt; seen in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approximate terms as opposed to fixed boundaries. However,<br/>i&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to ask people here with an interest in this sort of thing<br/>to<br/>&gt; give<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their own input based solely on their ears...okay, so with<br/>&gt; that in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind here are a few of the questions i&apos;d like to ask of<br/>&gt; anyone who<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might be interested enough to answer:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) if you were to allow that the 5/4 and 9/7 occupy<br/>completely<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; independent interval spaces, is there a space in-between<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; won&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be confused for either of these? The model says no, that the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; median,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 14/11 for instance, will most likely be misidentified<br/>as<br/>&gt; a 9/7<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval space rather than a 5/4 interval space; though the<br/>&gt; model<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predicts that this median&apos;s lower limit would share the<br/>5/4&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; upper<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limit.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) the model predicts that the space between thirds, the<br/>&gt; neutral<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; third, perhaps even the 11/9 itself, is a clearly defined<br/>&gt; space.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, the model predicts that the median space<br/>&gt; between an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8/7 and a 7/6 is no less defined than the far more common<br/>&gt; median<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval spaces of the 11/8 and the 13/8. According to the<br/>&gt; model<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 15/13 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/6 by approximately<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amount the 11/8 overlaps the lower limit of the 7/5 and the<br/>&gt; 13/8&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lower limit overlaps the 8/5&apos;s upper limit. So the question<br/>&gt; here<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how does that measure to people&apos;s ears.is the median space<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an 8/7 and a 7/6 as independently valid a space as that the<br/>&gt; 11/8<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 13/8 share with their simpler neighbors?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)According to the model, the 1/1 manifests a field of<br/>&gt; attraction<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strong and a shadow so long that there is a state of<br/>&gt; ambiguity all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way to the 11/10, 10/9 range. The 2/1 similarly back to<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 19/10, 17/9 range, and the 3/2 all the way back to the 10/7<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way up to the 11/7 space. How does this stand up ?<br/>&gt; remember,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; model is not so much saying here&apos;s the line where an<br/>interval<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; space<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitively changes as it is saying here&apos;s the area where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ambiguity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coalesces into a defined area of recognition .and all this<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat outside the usual connotations of the perceived<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; complexity<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or simplicity of a specific given ratio----&gt;in other words,<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 11/9<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might be the simplest ratio to define a neutral third, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whether or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not that&apos;s THE interval is somewhat besides the point in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; comparison<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the question of whether this is an independently<br/>&gt; articulated<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval space outside the field of attraction imposed by<br/>the<br/>&gt; long<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shadows of its neighbors.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Simple, rule-of-thumb measures for appraising a given<br/>&gt; ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complexity, like N*D ,et al., might not hold up so well.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; why?,well,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if the model has anything to say in this regard it clearly<br/>&gt; says<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an interval space such as the 16/9 are uniquely articulated<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whereas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interval spaces such as the 11/8 and the 13/8 are not.

What i meant<br/>was that smaller ratios, like the 5/4 you mention, are more apt to be<br/>heard as distinctly different despite very small mistunings, whereas<br/>more complex ratios such as the 11/8 as far less likely to be heard<br/>as decisively different given the same minute degree of mistuning.<br/>Now of course there are ears so rough when it comes to pitch<br/>discrimination, that a 2/1 can be mistaken for a 3/1--say in the<br/>average family&apos; happy birthday singalong--and ears so acute when it<br/>comes to pitch discrimination that they can confidently navigate<br/>extremely fine fractions of a tone, etc.</p><p>So many people, myself included, might say that to ask a math model<br/>questions only an ear can answer seem like the wrong approach given<br/>the question! But the ear is not only an instrument that operates<br/>with blind obedience on the physiological level, it&apos;s also one that<br/>is more and less acute, more and less biased, more and less<br/>contextually obligated to respond in one way or another of a thousand<br/>different ways.... so the idea with the math here is that i&apos;m only<br/>trying to imagine a generalization, one which is admittedly based<br/>more on intuition and a personal commitment to experiment with ideas<br/>i like than it is on any factual data.</p><p>So, with that troubling confession out of the way, what I&apos;m trying do<br/>is to generalize what ratio spaces are unique and which are not by<br/>asking a specific question, that is: which spaces within the octave<br/>are most unlikely to be mistaken for their neighbors? So for example,<br/>it&apos;s easy to see from the graph that while a quartertone is miles<br/>away from a semitone, all minor 2nds are unlikely to be discerned<br/>from their next closest neighbors... and it&apos;s exactly that kind of<br/>distinction that is really at the heart of this!</p><p>To look at it another way, and i&apos;ll take another thing you mentioned<br/>as an example, that the 5/4 seems quite different a 1/4 of a tone or<br/>so in either direction, well the experiment here says that that&apos;s<br/>true, and it says it&apos;s true because there&apos;s a space to the left at<br/>11/9 and a space to the right at 9/7 that are also unique from their<br/>nearest neighbors. In the graph, the height (the vertical axis) is an<br/>indication of a given ratios complexity, so the deeper the valley the<br/>simpler the pitch-space, and the higher the spike the more complex<br/>the pitch-space. But this aspect is dependent on the idea that we&apos;re<br/>talking about frequency ratios, as the height is solely dependent on<br/>the numerator and denominator of the ratio. What I&apos;m probably more<br/>interested in here is span and especially uniqueness---asking how<br/>wide an interval space is relative to its proposed uniqueness.</p><p>thanks,<br/><a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree with the notion that it works in such a way that the<br/>&gt; &quot;simplest&quot; intervals have a wider range of attraction - I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; 11:4 be recognizable from a full quarter tone up - C-F# in 12-tet<br/>can<br/>&gt; pass for 11:4 in certain cases.

But the ear is not only an instrument that operates<br/>&gt; with blind obedience on the physiological level, it&apos;s also one that<br/>&gt; is more and less acute, more and less biased, more and less<br/>&gt; contextually obligated to respond in one way or another of a thousand<br/>&gt; different ways.... so the idea with the math here is that i&apos;m only<br/>&gt; trying to imagine a generalization, one which is admittedly based<br/>&gt; more on intuition and a personal commitment to experiment with ideas<br/>&gt; i like than it is on any factual data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, with that troubling confession out of the way, what I&apos;m trying do<br/>&gt; is to generalize what ratio spaces are unique and which are not by<br/>&gt; asking a specific question, that is: which spaces within the octave<br/>&gt; are most unlikely to be mistaken for their neighbors? So for example,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s easy to see from the graph that while a quartertone is miles<br/>&gt; away from a semitone, all minor 2nds are unlikely to be discerned<br/>&gt; from their next closest neighbors... and it&apos;s exactly that kind of<br/>&gt; distinction that is really at the heart of this!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To look at it another way, and i&apos;ll take another thing you mentioned<br/>&gt; as an example, that the 5/4 seems quite different a 1/4 of a tone or<br/>&gt; so in either direction, well the experiment here says that that&apos;s<br/>&gt; true, and it says it&apos;s true because there&apos;s a space to the left at<br/>&gt; 11/9 and a space to the right at 9/7 that are also unique from their<br/>&gt; nearest neighbors. In the graph, the height (the vertical axis) is an<br/>&gt; indication of a given ratios complexity, so the deeper the valley the<br/>&gt; simpler the pitch-space, and the higher the spike the more complex<br/>&gt; the pitch-space. But this aspect is dependent on the idea that we&apos;re<br/>&gt; talking about frequency ratios, as the height is solely dependent on<br/>&gt; the numerator and denominator of the ratio. What I&apos;m probably more<br/>&gt; interested in here is span and especially uniqueness---asking how<br/>&gt; wide an interval space is relative to its proposed uniqueness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks,<br/>&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a> &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &quot;Mike &gt; Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I disagree with the notion that it works in such a way that the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;simplest&quot; intervals have a wider range of attraction - I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; &gt; 11:4 be recognizable from a full quarter tone up - C-F# in 12-tet<br/>&gt; can<br/>&gt; &gt; pass for 11:4 in certain cases. On the other hand, 5:4 a quarter<br/>&gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; down or up doesn&apos;t sound like 5:4 at all, usually.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
