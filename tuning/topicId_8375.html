They are also called &quot;frequency meters&quot; or &quot;freq.<br/>meters&quot; for short -- which leads to jokes about &quot;freak meters&quot;.  :-)</p><p>A portable computer with any of a number of different software packages<br/>(including some that are shareware, I think) should also be able to do<br/>the job. :-)</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if this will serve the ultimate purpose for which you<br/>wanted a frequency counter, but you might want to check out the Korg<br/>MT-1200 Multi-Temperament Tuner -- it has several different temperament<br/>presets, programmable temperaments, and support for stretch tunings for<br/>piano, etc.  Korg has an understated listing of it on their website at:</p><p><a href="http://www.korg.com/tunerchr.htm">http://www.korg.com/tunerchr.htm</a></p><p>I have one and can provide more info. about it if you are interested.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div><h3><a id=8376 href="#8376">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;caccola@net1plus.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2000 1:22:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph,</p><p>Tunelab 97 might be something to look into, very powerful shareware by<br/>Robert Scott specifically for piano tuning, including some temperaments from<br/>Jorgensen (I don&apos;t know just how customizable they are). I&apos;m pretty sure it<br/>measures hz, too.</p><p><a href="http://www.wwnet.net/~rscott/">http://www.wwnet.net/~rscott/</a></p><p>Clark</p></div>
