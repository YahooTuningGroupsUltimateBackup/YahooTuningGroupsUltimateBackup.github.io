Ed Foote&apos;s<br/> CD _Beethoven in the Temperaments_, which was released about<br/> a year ago, is the only investigation I know of, and it was  criticized<br/>a bit in this forum, altho I liked it.)</p><p> What I found in this experiment, and which surprised me,<br/> is that, contrary to just about anything you&apos;ll read anywhere,<br/> including some of my own stuff, 12:15:18 is *NOT* an accurate<br/> analysis of a Dominant [V] chord.</p><p> The (culturally-conditioned?) preference for a sharpened<br/> Pythagorean &apos;leading-tone&apos; makes this chord sound flat, at<br/> least in this piece, and to my ears.  It sounds a lot better<br/> using the Pythagorean pitch for the leading tone, and choosing<br/> the &apos;root&apos; and &apos;5th&apos; which make a nice 4:5:6 triad with it,<br/> in the corresponding area of the harmonic lattice.</p><p> This requires a &apos;root-movement&apos; in the chord progression which<br/> is quite a bit more complex than the typically Pythagorean<br/> &apos;root-movement&apos; which is usually assumed.</p><p> Also, the proportions of some chords that are used in passing<br/> is considerably more complex than those usually found in<br/> a JI analysis of music from this period.</p><p> The only reason I haven&apos;t said anything about this until now is<br/> because the MIDI file is still unfinished and I wanted to put<br/> the completed analysis and sequence up on my website, but<br/> since Ray Tomes rekindled discussion of it, I decided to work<br/> a bit more on what I already had, and put it online &apos;in progress&apos;:</p><p> <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm</a></p><p> -monz</p><p> Joseph L.

That gives a highly raised leading tone<br/>much in accord with the modern practice of a typical string quartet playing<br/>Beethoven.</p></div>
