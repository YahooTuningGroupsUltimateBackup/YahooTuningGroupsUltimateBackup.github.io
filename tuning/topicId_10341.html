It used to be a little on the<br/>opaque side...  Thanks, everybody for my &quot;Internet Education.&quot;</p><p>Among some of the most intriguing issues were some from 1989 which had<br/>interviews with La Monte Young.  I have been a Young fan ever since I<br/>sang ragas with him after one of Johnny Reinhard&apos;s Amazing American<br/>Festivals of Microtonal Music.  Well, more technically, La Monte Young<br/>sang the raga, and I did the drone...</p><p>In any case, I was surprised and intrigued by the statements that La<br/>Monte Young was not at all interested in the Utonal series, but was a<br/>dedicated OTonalist...</p><p>In addition, it was mentioned that Young avoided 5-limit sonorities...<br/>the &quot;major&quot; third.  Actually, this places him rather in a &quot;traditional<br/>modernist&quot; camp, with other people who clearly were tired of triadic<br/>music, Aaron Copland among them.</p><p>Copland, of course, was a &quot;Trine&quot; man... among the other &quot;Trine-i-ties.&quot;<br/>______________ _________ ____ _ _ _ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
