It&apos;s easily demonstrated that cuboctas don&apos;t fill<br/>space: try it!  If you take eight cuboctas and join them by the square<br/>faces, you find them surrounding an octahedral hole.  And there aren&apos;t<br/>any other ways to do it--you can&apos;t very well join the square faces to<br/>the triangular ones, and the highly symmetric shapes mean there aren&apos;t<br/>any alternative orientations to try.</p><p>Kelvin&apos;s shape is just called a truncated octahedron, BTW.  And if you<br/>fit them together as above, the octahedral spaces that were left using<br/>cuboctas expand just enough to butt up against each other at the<br/>vertices and become truncated octas themselves.</p><p>Okay, now here&apos;s why I think you want the rhombic dodec instead of the<br/>truncated octa.  &lt;deep breath&gt;  If you look at the way the truncated<br/>octa fills space, you&apos;ll find that its symmetry group is that of a<br/>body-centered cubic lattice.  The rhombic dodec, OTOH, fills space such<br/>that is _its_ symmetry group is that of a _face_-centered cubic<br/>lattice.</p><p>Why is this important?  Well, let&apos;s think about why we use FCC (= oc-tet<br/>or triangulated lattice) for pitch diagrams in the first place.  If you<br/>ignore the edges and just look at the lattice points, it&apos;s equivalent to<br/>the cubic lattice--it&apos;s just been subjected to a couple of affine<br/>(shear) transformations.  (Translation: we squished it a bit so that it<br/>slants.)  This makes sense because the lattice is actually a space whose<br/>basis is the three vectors representing the 3/2, the 5/4, and the 7/4.<br/>Right?</p><p>Now look at the way the shapes you want to use to tesselate space with.<br/>They _also_ are related to each other by three basic vectors, it&apos;s just<br/>that this time, it&apos;s the three unison vectors.  Other than that, the<br/>relationship is the same.  But there&apos;s no way you can map the BCC to a<br/>straightforward cubic lattice--you either have to leave some points out<br/>of the cubic lattice, or interlock two cubic lattices together.</p><p>In sum: the hexagon is the Voronoi cell of the 2d triangulated lattice,<br/>and the rhombic docec is the Voronoi cell of the 3d triangulated<br/>lattice.  Since the Voronoi cell is by definition the set of points<br/>closer to a particular lattice point than to any other, it makes sense<br/>that this is a good shape to start with when looking for &quot;the<br/>best-connected, smallest-diameter pitchsets&quot;.</p><p>On Thu, 28 Oct 1999, Paul H.

It&apos;s not<br/>just a question of taking your unison vectors and running.  You might<br/>find that with a given set of vectors, the scale circumscribed by the<br/>parallelogram satisfied your conditions, but the one resulting from the<br/>hexagon didn&apos;t--or vice versa.  Even if you restricted yourself to the<br/>best-connected, smallest-diameter pitchset for a given set of vectors,<br/>that _still_ doesn&apos;t determine a unique scale--usually even after you&apos;ve<br/>gotten the connectivity maximized and the diameter minimized, there are<br/>still several pitches you can transpose by one unison vector or another<br/>to give you different scales, but not change the connectivity and<br/>diameter.  And each time that happens, you run the risk of one such<br/>scale &quot;working&quot;, and the other not.</p><p>In addition to this, I believe (although I have yet to prove it<br/>rigorously) that _all_ sets of unison vectors which yield a given number<br/>of pitches are, basically, equivalent; at least all those which don&apos;t<br/>correspond to ludicrously large intervals.  By &quot;equivalent&quot; I mean that<br/>given two such sets, you can transform one to the other by (repeatedly<br/>if necessary) adding or subtracting one vector within the set to one of<br/>the others, which (from linear algebra) we know does not change the<br/>value of the determinant.  Assuming that my conjecture on this is true,<br/>it seems to me that trying to pick the &quot;best&quot; set of vectors for a given<br/>number of scale degrees is really sort of beside the point--the pitchset<br/>is more important than the vectors.  Which would tend to imply that no<br/>method is going to be significantly better than brute force . . .

It&apos;s not<br/>&gt;just a question of taking your unison vectors and running.  You might<br/>&gt;find that with a given set of vectors, the scale circumscribed by the<br/>&gt;parallelogram satisfied your conditions, but the one resulting from the<br/>&gt;hexagon didn&apos;t--or vice versa.  Even if you restricted yourself to the<br/>&gt;best-connected, smallest-diameter pitchset for a given set of vectors,<br/>&gt;that _still_ doesn&apos;t determine a unique scale--usually even after you&apos;ve<br/>&gt;gotten the connectivity maximized and the diameter minimized, there are<br/>&gt;still several pitches you can transpose by one unison vector or another<br/>&gt;to give you different scales, but not change the connectivity and<br/>&gt;diameter.
