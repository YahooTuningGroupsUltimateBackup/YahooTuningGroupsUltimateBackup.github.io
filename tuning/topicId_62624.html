My own interest is in just intonation on acoustic instruments, and I have just finally progressed to the composing stage, after years of acquiring information (mostly anecdotal, and from all sorts of sources) and working up the nerve.<br/>&gt;  My own position, based on empirical observation, is that theoretical/acoustical objections to JI on acoustic instruments are vastly overstated. Acoustic instruments can clearly project intervals up to at least a 13 limit, regardless of the decimal points, phase shifting, etc. A few examples : in Ben Johnston&apos;s Suite for Microtonal Piano (which has been recorded) intervals of 7 &amp; 11 are clear and convincing (the tuning is actually 19-limit); brass instruments can more or less easily play up to at least 13 (up to 23 on horn) (also, valves can be tuned subharmonically, e.g. to give 1/16:1/17:1/18...1/22); on my cello (which I just got last month) I can reach the 31st harmonic, intervals of 11 &amp; 13 are clearly consonant, and I&apos;ve even been able to tune a 17:1 beat-free.<br/>&gt;  Complexity and voicing of the interval applies, of course; an 11:4 is much easier to tune than an 11:9, etc. Doubtlessly there are limitations, also - I&apos;ve heard chords like 11:13:15:17:19 sound audibly beat-free electronically, but it may be a bit of a stretch for acoustic instruments! Even then, it might work on harpsichord, or on French horns (with enough rehearsal).<br/>&gt;  I don&apos;t recall if you mentioned your instrument or resources; thanks to the miracle of internet wholesale you can get a cello for $250 or an alto or baritone horn for c. $100 - if its within your means, I&apos;d highly recommend picking up whatever you can make a sound on and start exploring!<br/>&gt;  Chris<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
