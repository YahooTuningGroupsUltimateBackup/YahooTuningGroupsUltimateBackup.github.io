The 9/10 of root gives you<br/>a 6/5 at the top, so more relaxed, which seems nice,<br/>but the 8/9 gives a 4/3 above the tonic which is also nice.</p><p>At the end of the third bar for the piano part, of the piece I play,<br/>it has G + (D -&gt; F) which is surely a V7.</p><p>It goes to<br/>C F,<br/>resolving to the I.</p><p>The C F there is on the first beat of the bar, and sustained for a quaver,<br/>so quite prominent, and one thinks a nice 4/3 for it would be better than<br/>the other way of using a  27/20 = 9/8*6/5 to help with the G to the F minor third<br/>of the V7 (which doesn&apos;t even have the G sounding).</p><p>The F is a repeated note, and the way it is used, is a kind<br/>of anticipation of the next note, and then the C also carries through to<br/>the I (with a semiquaver rest).</p><p>So, that kind of suggests it would work best with the 9/10 of root<br/>perhaps.</p><p>Once flute is added on repeat of that section,<br/>it becomes:</p><p>C D F</p><p>(resolving to the I)</p><p>so the C F looks like a II7 there I think.</p><p>(I&apos;m not that used to analysing music in this way<br/>so it&apos;s quite slow for me to do, but I think it is<br/>prob. correct.)</p><p>Anyway, for the piece I practice at least maybe the 8/9 would<br/>be more suitable for the sparse textures (it has only three<br/>lines all the way through, two for piano and one for the<br/>flute, &amp; very easy piano part apart from the ornaments).</p><p>Come to think of it I imagine that such a sparse texture<br/>might be quite a challenge for adaptive tuning?</p><p>Also been trying out a few V7 - I progressions in both tunings,<br/>and, not sure, but possibly the 8/9 feels a bit more like<br/>C.P.E. Bach somehow. Gives crisper cadences somehow.</p><p>Could be interesting if you did one with both.</p><p>I&apos;m happy for it to wander about quite a bit in pitch<br/>so perhaps that means soft vertical springs? Or are<br/>those the horizontal springs?</p><p>I remember a post about the springs, but can&apos;t find it<br/>right now, and am a bit hazy about the details. I&apos;ll have<br/>a look for it in the Yahoo archive I&apos;m making.</p><p>If you&apos;ve done some of them already, could be interesting<br/>to compare!</p><p>I wonder, maybe I could sequence the CPE Bach by typing it<br/>into NWC, or maybe even play it. My piano skills are also<br/>rudimentary, especially when playing from music, but<br/>this is a very easy piece to read. Just two lines for the piano<br/>part. I&apos;m sure it is originally for amateurs to play, both for<br/>piano and flute parts (third register E can&apos;t be that high for<br/>a baroque flute of the time I think, to judge by how often it is<br/>used in flute music of the time).</p><p>Could be useful for practice if you didn&apos;t mind sequencing<br/>a practice file for me - not for listening to for pleasure!</p><p>Thanks for the ideas about the adaptive tuning cue points.</p><p>Yes, maybe that could be quite a feasible way to do it.<br/>I&apos;ll think it over some. (I&apos;ve been mulling over another idea<br/>which seemed promising at first, but then I realised it<br/>would involve a twelve dimensional multiply threaded<br/>sparse array, with the threads connecting &quot;nearby nodes&quot;<br/>in 12-dim space; don&apos;t know if anyone has coded such a beast,<br/>but it looked like it was going to be slow to add new entries<br/>to it, and use too much memory to be of much use, anyway,<br/>the simpler the construct, the better, if it works).</p><p>Sounds like the Chopin CD would be a nice one to get.</p><p>Actually was rather interested in that one from your review<br/>of it. I&apos;d like to order one of Ed Foote&apos;s CDs and hear what<br/>he is doing!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
