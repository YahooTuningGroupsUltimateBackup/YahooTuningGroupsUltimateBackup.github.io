If you look at the sounds typically associated with inducing calm/meditative states (i.e. bells, gongs, &quot;binaural beats&quot;, didgeridoos, chants, etc.) one thing they all have in common is an utter LACK of static unchanging beatless notes.  Even in a group chanting &quot;om&quot;, the fact that everyone is slightly off from each other induces some very complex beating patterns.  I mean, if pure low-limit JI harmony is so calming, why aren&apos;t there meditation CD&apos;s out there of a pure 4:5:6 triad sustained for 30+ minutes?  I&apos;ll tell you why: because that would drive most people INSANE.</p><p>So maybe to please and calm your baby, you WANT some nice soothing beating brought on by intervals nestled nicely between minima and maxima of dyadic H.E.; so maybe a harmonic series chunk like 23:27:31:35:39:47 or 29:34:39:45:51:59 (yep, stretched octaves), 5-EDO, the 23-EDO antipentatonic (0-261-470-730-939-1200), the 7-EDO version of the standard pentatonic (0-171-514-686-1029-1200), or even (gasp) a traditional gamelan tuning?</p><p>Or maybe a hybrid approach whereby you include some beatless intervals and some intervals about 20-30 cents apart from them, maybe going up to an 8-note scale like this: 64:72:80:81:96:111:112:126:128?

(Kalle, too!)</p><p>I have a lot of kids, and when they&apos;re young they seem to like big, open, consonant intervals. When they hit two different things, they like to hear a significant difference between them. (That includes siblings, by the way.) Also, when they&apos;re really young they just bang on everything at once, so I&apos;d say you&apos;re really looking for a chord more than a scale. If it were me, I&apos;d look for fewer wide intervals rather than more narrow ones.</p><p>Six months ago, I would have suggested a C-E-G-C chord, maybe with an A thrown in -- simple, wide, consonant. Since joining this list, I&apos;ve found that I really like some of the septimal intervals, especially the minor third and the harmonic seventh, and I like those in triads with either a fifth or a fourth. So today, I might try a nice mix of typical and atypical intervals like this:</p><p>1/1<br/>7/6<br/>3/2<br/>7/4<br/>2/1</p><p>Baby harmony -- banging on them all at once -- sounds pretty good, and there are no &quot;bad&quot; intervals. Friends and neighbors probably won&apos;t be disturbed by the &quot;out of tune&quot; toy. I might add the perfect fourth, too; I don&apos;t know that I would have in the CEGC chord, because it&apos;s a little close to both the G and the E, but here the 7/6 is pretty far away, and it feels more comfortable. If you add it, your most complex interval is a 21/16: No Big Bad Wolf to be afraid of here.</p><p>Whatever you decide, please let us know what the baby likes! :)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=95873 href="#95873">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2011 8:59:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Awesome!

If you listen to Norwegian folk music which often uses overtone flutes and is sometimes accompanied by keyboard instruments, you&apos;ll know what I mean. The melodies which were &quot;composed&quot; using overtone flutes, not pianos, can&apos;t be played &quot;properly&quot; on a piano but who cares? Certainly many people don&apos;t because they know the original melody well enough to think it in their mind while a piano plays it only &quot;approximately&quot;. And even if they don&apos;t always sing it accurately, they often view modes like 6:7:8:9:10:11:12<br/>(or maybe rather 8:9:10:11:12:14:16) as the &quot;model&quot; scales for these overtone-based tunes.<br/>Another thing is that if you didn&apos;t know anything about classical harmony and someone played you the melody of, let&apos;s say, &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;, you might possibly play some weird accompaniment unintentionally, while if you do know something about classical harmony, you probably will have some control over the way you wish to harmonize it -- i.e. you&apos;ll obviously play something that &quot;isn&apos;t there in the melody itself&quot; but it&apos;s not just a sole matter of your invention, it&apos;s a matter of harmonizing with regard to the context of the melody you are given.

On another hand something I can add on the matter, as a harmonic fute maker and player myself, is that stricly speaking, tielinkas, koncovkas, salgflojts etc. do not play exactly a overtone scale. For some acoustic reason, the odd harmonics 3 5 7 11 13 15 are always some comma above their theorical position compared to the even harmonics 4 6 8 10 12 14 16.

Now I see you&apos;ve misunderstood the first point I was making, not the second one, since you have swapped the roles of the sung intervals and the approximated ones. For many Wagogo musicians, the &quot;model&quot; scale is 5:6:7:8:9:10 (or 6:7:8:9:10:12) and they tune this &quot;linear pentatonic&quot; on many of their &quot;fixed-pitched&quot; instruments. When they play the &quot;izeze&quot; (a fretless bowed instrument) or when they sing, obviously, then they approximate this linear pentatonic as much as they care to. The point I was making was that I was surprised how well those children succeeded in doing this and that even if an &quot;uninformed&quot; musician may not be sure what intervals they were trying to sing, I&apos;m quite certain that the &quot;model&quot; melody which they were thinking of was meant to be in this scale. It&apos;s similar to European children trying to sing in 12-EDO.</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately I don&apos;t recall the name of the group, but I heard the music &gt; of one of<br/>&gt; the most famous Swedish (or Norvegian ?) folk groups of the new &gt; generation, that integrate intelligently the<br/>&gt; salgflojt quartertones with the other string<br/>&gt; instruments.</p><p>Possibly Hedningarna? Those are Swedish as well. Then there&apos;s someone from Finland who has used overtone flutes -- I think her name was something like Joutsenlahti or Joussenlahti or some such.</p><p>&gt; I corrected some flutes successfully by using a larger tube at the end, &gt; forming a little bell,</p><p>Wow, didn&apos;t the resonances get mistuned too much from proper harmonics then? Recently, I was asking my father (who is a &quot;non-musician&quot;) to do such a thing with a plastic pipe and some of the resonances got almost a quartertone away.

The sound texture you have with this flute &gt; is absolutely charming.</p><p>Thanks for such a positive comment. I&apos;ll tell you something. When I began learning to play this instrument back in 2003 (not the imaginary one, of course, but the one which sounds an octave higher), the tones were overlapping heavily and I thought I would never be able to play this thing. Anyway, within a few weeks of frequent practicing, I almost felt in love with its sound and, all of a sudden, I just didn&apos;t want to stop. I was playing it &quot;day and night&quot; and later I was even taking it to the boarding house during the last year of my secondary school studies (you see, I just didn&apos;t want to go anywhere without my overtone flute :-D). So I&apos;m glad you liked it.</p><p>&gt; Sounds like it has a quite important inside diameter (like 20 mm ?), but &gt; that may be the pitch effect.</p><p>The real flute has an inside diameter of ~16 mm. Perhaps if you doubled all the quantities (including the diameter and the length and everything), maybe you would then get something like the sound on the recording, who knows?</p><p>I would, anyway, be interested if it&apos;s possible to somehow find out what the largest overtone flute ever made was like, in the world. :-)</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=96002 href="#96002">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2011 2:35:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Petr,</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, you&apos;re playing in extended JI.
