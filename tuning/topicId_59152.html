One view is that the<br/>tambur was an ancient development of the &apos;kopuz,&apos; while others<br/>suggest that its own history goes back to very early times. Yet<br/>another theory is that the tambur is the first evolution and change<br/>of the baglama family of instruments.</p><p>The word tambur comes from the Arabic &apos;tunbur,&apos; and it is widely<br/>believed that this comes from the Sumerian word &apos;pantur,&apos; a<br/>semispherical stringed instrument with a long stem. Another view<br/>is that it comes from the words (tabla, tabl, tabil, tabul etc.) for<br/>percussion instruments that have been used since the very<br/>earliest times. There is mention in the Hittite civilisation of a<br/>stringed instrument called a &apos;TIBULA.&apos; It is generally agreed that<br/>this was in all probability a long-stemmed stringed instrument.<br/>Texts from those times reveal that it was used to accaompany the<br/>spoken word and dancing. All of this inevitably leads one to the<br/>opinion that the roots of the instrument go back to Hittite and<br/>Sumerian times. The word &apos;tambur&apos; was later used in Iran and<br/>central Asia for pear-bodied long-stemmed instruments more<br/>closely resembling the baglama. Some instruments today played<br/>by the Turks of Asia are called &apos;tambura,&apos; or &apos;dombra&apos; etc. Today<br/>the tambur, described by European travellers (such as Charles<br/>Fonton and Toderini) as a visible reflection of the Turkish musical<br/>system with its fret links on the stem, is probably the only<br/>instrument solely used in Turkey. The instrument was carried to<br/>Europe by migrants, and it is known that it was used in the 12th<br/>and 13th centuries before being abandoned.</p><p>This instrument developed with the historical process that gave<br/>rise to Ottoman music, reaching its most developed form in the<br/>16th century and becoming an indispensable part of that music.<br/>The body of the tambur is semispherical and made by sticking<br/>layers of wood together side by side. It generally has a diameter of<br/>up to 35 cm. The stem is joined to the body be being buried in a<br/>wedge, and is about 104 cm. long. The peg area is an extension<br/>of the stem. Each of the strings that emerge from the peforated<br/>string wedge at the edge of the body goes over the bridge and<br/>along the stem, being attached to the pegs by being tapped into<br/>the notched main bridge made of bone and the other bone bridge<br/>at the end of it. The bridge is generally made of fir, and presses<br/>onto the chest, itself generally made of thin pine. The vibration of<br/>the strings lead to that part of the chest under the bridge being<br/>indented. The bottom of the stem is round, and the top flat. The<br/>fret links used to be made of gut, although nylon is usually<br/>preferred these days. The tambur had between 45 and 55 frets.<br/>Some tambur virtuosi wanted to make the transposition of the<br/>melodic creation to several frets easier by linking 64 and even 65<br/>of them. The oldest known form of the tambur is two-stringed,<br/>although these days it generally has seven. Eight strings were<br/>employed in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p><p>The inflexible tambur plectrum is usually made of tortoiseshell. It is<br/>about 12 cm. long, 9-10 mm. wide and 1-1.5 mm. thick, and both<br/>ends can be used. However, the two ends are different to one<br/>another to allow them to be used for different timbres. The<br/>plectrum is held with the thumb and index and middle fingers of<br/>the right hand, and the thin side is used to strike the strings in a<br/>perpendicular manner. That is what gives the instrument its full-<br/>bodied sound. Apart from the kopuz, which has had its own place<br/>in courtly Ottoman music since the 16th century, the tambur is<br/>presently the only instrument to be played in this manner.</p><p>Although the tambur was a plucked stringed instrument, Tamburi<br/>Cemil Bey played it with a bow instead, which immediately<br/>became very popular. In the old way of playing the instrument, the<br/>&apos;steel&apos; and &apos;copper&apos; strings were struck once and the melody would<br/>be produced by using as many frets as possible before the<br/>vibration faded away. That led to it being resembled to the human<br/>larynx.</p><p>******************************</p><p>It is clear from this description that a larger number of frets than<br/>24 frets per octave (say, 64 frets / 2 = 32 frets per octave) is to<br/>accommodate transpositions, not to alter basic music theory.</p><p>It is clear from this description that Tamburi Cemil Bey&apos;s<br/>adaptation of the tunbur with &quot;as many frets as possible&quot; was to<br/>serve the subtle intonations of the human voice, not to alter basic<br/>music theory.</p><p>From the Ocara Radio France CD --</p><p>Turquie:  Archives de la musique turque (2)</p><p>a solo tunbur recording by Mes&apos;ud Ekrem Cemil Bey Tel (1902-<br/>1963), [son of Tamburi Cemil Bey (1871-1916)] in Makam Mahur -<br/>- and composed by Tamburi Cemil Bey -- clearly indicates a<br/>tuning based on 24 frets per octave.</p><p>Cris Forster, Music Director<br/><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p></div><h3><a id=59161 href="#59161">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2005 1:30:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Utter bafflement and horror descends on me.<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Cris Forster<br/>  To: Tuning<br/>  Sent: 15 Haziran 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 19:02<br/>  Subject: [tuning] The Modern Turkish Tunbur of Mes&apos;ud Ekrem Cemil Bey Tel</p><p>  &gt;From --</p><p>  <a href="http://www.kulturturizm.gov.tr/portal/kultur_en.asp?belgeno=5896">http://www.kulturturizm.gov.tr/portal/kultur_en.asp?belgeno=5896</a></p><p>  ******************************</p><p>  This is one, and perhaps the most important, of the stringed and<br/>  plucked instruments of Ottoman music.
