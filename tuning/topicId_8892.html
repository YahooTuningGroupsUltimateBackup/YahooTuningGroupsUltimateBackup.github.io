Same thing from G-sharp up to B. Now, the cliches of<br/>blues developed around a certain synchronicity between the steps of<br/>the scale and the regularity of 4/4 or 12/8 meter. Change the number<br/>of steps in the scale, and suddenly you&apos;re pushing the meter around as<br/>well.</p><p>Patterns that would occupy a predictable four beats for any other<br/>blues player, Haverstick needs five or six for. That IV or V chord<br/>comes in as expected, but always a beat or two late. And yet the<br/>integrity of the scale renders the musical logic seamless.&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div>
