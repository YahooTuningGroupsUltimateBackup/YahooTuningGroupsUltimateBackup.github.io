I will remain nearer of sound here.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to forget probability context of continuous curves and to<br/>conceive perception as pure continuous transduction of precise interval to<br/>precise dissonance sensation. Reality is always more complex than all our<br/>models and appears with tausend forms of discontinuity. Here are few examples.</p><p>Seen of space, oceans appear like near perfect sphere, but seen from boat<br/>in tempest evidence is well distinct.</p><p>Possility to add oil in olive barrel implies a discontinuity kind. Since 45<br/>Mhz sampling is about limit of perceptibility, theorical possibility exists<br/>to interpolate tons of imperceptible data at higher frequencies.</p><p>Limited number of Corti cells don&apos;t permit continuous process and we can<br/>say by principle that all type of perception have grain.</p><p>Neurons are not continuous transductor with a N-dimensional function but<br/>are fired by complex association (changing in time) of data flux.<br/>Information is always distributed on group of neurons and has sense by mean<br/>of collective response.</p><p>However, it&apos;s not really this resulting fine grain that worry me but<br/>discontinuity implied at higher (semiotic) level of<br/>sensibility/intelligibility articulation. We can distinct maybe 1800 pitch<br/>levels, but few tens of tones are used in music. I think that this<br/>restriction is not well understood. Restriction on tones is only a reflect<br/>of deeper restriction since acceptable values for one tone form a<br/>continuous space.</p><p>Pure sensitive approach with dissonance minima has only limited validity<br/>domain that has to be contained. We have to take account also of other<br/>parts of reality for musical perception understanding. Musical listening is<br/>not a passive process but an active one that implies not only sensation but<br/>pattern recognition, memorized categories, focusing attention and<br/>retroactive action of brain on cochlea.</p><p>Retroaction (like phasing or counterphasing of outer hair cells) implies<br/>that mind don&apos;t work from pure sensitive images contained in brain. Brain<br/>actively participate to buid pertinent sensations helping intentional<br/>presence at musical work.</p><p>All that are glimpses. My approach of tonal intelligibility by acoustical<br/>parametric invariance gives access to an other part of reality which can&apos;t<br/>be bypass, in my opinion.</p><p>At end, I&apos;m also curious of several other parts of reality : impedance<br/>model in cochear fluids and estimation of delays giving pressure difference<br/>acting on basilar membrane, neuronal coincidence detectors as revealed in<br/>visual cortex, chaotic analyse, etc.</p><p>I cut here.

Am I following your meaning?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Your input provides one person&apos;s empirical evidence that I&apos;m right.<br/>:)</p><p>I&apos;ve been embroiled in debates about the odd- vs. prime-<br/>dichotomy here in the past, mostly with Paul Erlich, and Paul&apos;s<br/>firm-as-concrete logic (backed up with agreement from Dave<br/>Keenan&apos;s experiments [*]) has convinced me that I should agree<br/>with him that odd-limit is the important consideration when<br/>scrutinizing *intervals*, that is, dyads.</p><p>But for any more complex simultaneities (triads, tetrads, etc.),<br/>or indeed for melodic (i.e., scalar) and certainly for systemic<br/>considerations, prime-limit is where it&apos;s at.</p><p>Paul and others agree with this to some extent too.  In fact,<br/>I think we both agree that the prime-ness doesn&apos;t really come<br/>out until three or more pitches are sounded collectively.</p><p>Bare dyads/intervals only seem to give a sense of &apos;prime-ness&apos;<br/>up to about the 11-limit or so, and then only for the &apos;basic&apos;<br/>harmonic intervals (3/2, 5/4, 7/4, 11/8), not for more complex<br/>intervals like 6/5, 11/7, etc.</p><p>So even in the case of dyads, perception of prime-ness seems<br/>to be bound together with perception of &apos;tonalness&apos;, which<br/>I certainly think is true about tri- and higher-ads.</p><p>As you observe, the composite (= non-prime) ratios give recurring<br/>interval sizes as one travels up the harmonic series, but the<br/>primes always give distinct _gestalts_.  I think this is the<br/>most important observation about primes in harmonic theory.</p><p>Ivor Darreg made frequent reference to the individual &apos;moods&apos;<br/>of various ETs.  I haven&apos;t done much research into this area yet,<br/>but my contention is that these &apos;moods&apos; are directly related to<br/>the &apos;affect&apos; we perceive thru the prime-factor reduction process.</p><p>I like to use prime-factoring for my lattice formula because<br/>it gives me a way to look at *all* the rational tunings that<br/>have been theorized, and to see at a glance what they have<br/>in common or in difference.</p><p>Odd-factoring only complicates the matter, because composite<br/>ratios occupy a redundant distinct odd-factor point in ratio-space<br/>at the same time that they fit into their proper prime-factor<br/>point; for example, 9/8 would be the first point along the 9-axis,<br/>but it would also be the second point along the 3-axis.</p><p>I reiterate that I agree that odd-limit is preferable when<br/>considering intervals, as in Paul&apos;s &apos;diadic harmonic entropy&apos;<br/>graphs.  The prime-limit theory applies only when studying<br/>pitch-aggregates larger than dyads, and there IMO it is more<br/>important than odd-limit.</p><p>Another point to be made is that of naming or characterizing<br/>these prime affects.  We&apos;ve discussed it a little here, but<br/>most of us end up agreeing that the clearest way to talk about<br/>it is simply to refer to &apos;3-ness&apos;, 5-ness&apos;, &apos;7-ness&apos;, etc.<br/>I notice that you&apos;ve opted for this approach too.</p><p>Many of us here also agree with what you said above, that<br/>9/8 exhibits compond &apos;3-ness&apos;, and that 15/8 exhibits a<br/>mixture of &apos;3-ness&apos; and &apos;5-ness&apos;, and so on.  We&apos;ve debated<br/>where the limits of this perceptual ability lie, but with<br/>no stronger conclusion than those similar to what I posted<br/>about a week ago, &apos;somewhere between 11 and 23&apos;.</p><p>As I said in the post you quoted, I believe that somehow my<br/>prime-factor lattice formula is tied into how we perceive harmony<br/>and &apos;tonalness&apos;.</p><p>I wish I could say more about it, but thousands of mathematicians<br/>have been studying the magic of the prime series for a long time,<br/>and there are still very few conclusive statements that can be<br/>drawn about it.  Perhaps the very mysteriousness of how the<br/>prime series works is ultimately why (if I&apos;m right) we use it as<br/>the ultimate numerical reductionary process... sort of like a<br/>numerical &apos;God&apos; concept.</p><p>Take a look at my &apos;Favorite Links&apos; page: the &apos;Prime Pages&apos; site<br/>gives lots of info.</p><p>----<br/>[*] This was during the discussion of complexity which occurred<br/>here around April - June 1999.
