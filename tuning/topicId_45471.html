But of course there are many other possibilities<br/>besides the two you suggest.</p><p>I&apos;d like to know more about the first tuning above. The second is a<br/>purely theoretical construction based on iterating a 768 cent &quot;fifth&quot;.<br/>It is only that fifth that is claimed to be derived from Chinese<br/>bamboo pipes (of what place and time?).</p><p>Pelog tunings do also contain a chain (or chains) of &quot;fifths&quot; of about<br/>that size, but the one given looks too perfectly so, and so I suspect<br/>it to be partly theoretical too.</p><p>It might be that there was no influence from one to the other and the<br/>768 cent generator just happens to be the best solution to a<br/>particular musical problem (like the evolution of the eye as a<br/>solution to a biological problem, ocurring at least three times<br/>independently).</p><p>But what exactly is the problem that it solves? Paul Erlich has<br/>suggested that, in the case of Pelog, it is the problem of<br/>approximating 4:5 and 5:6 frequency ratios with a short chain of<br/>approximate 2:3&apos;s, even shorter than that of meantone. Paul&apos;s argument<br/>relies on inharmonic timbres to eliminate the objectionable nature of<br/>the 24 cent errors involved. Unfortunately, this doesn&apos;t work for<br/>bamboo pipes. I think there may be some other explanation of the 768<br/>cent generator.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=45478 href="#45478">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2003 2:50:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It seems like I&apos;m going senile, at 42. :-)</p><p>Everywhere in my previous post that I wrote 768 cent &quot;fifth&quot; or 768<br/>cent generator, I meant to write 678 cent &quot;fifth&quot; or 678 cent generator.</p><p>I also wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich has<br/>&gt; suggested that, in the case of Pelog, it is the problem of<br/>&gt; approximating 4:5 and 5:6 frequency ratios with a short chain of<br/>&gt; approximate 2:3&apos;s, even shorter than that of meantone.</p><p>In fact the complexity is the same.
