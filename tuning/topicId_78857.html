I agree though I would like to explicitly state that it is a continuum not an either or situation. Some ambient artists, notably Chris Gross of the now defunct IUMA site, specialized in texture created by subtle dissoinant notes. While modern music can have dynamics, I think the use of dynamics in texture is a 3rd dimension in generating a mood in a single timbre set and not widely used. - where this fits into micro is I&apos;m developing a sense that grappeling with continunity is a good direction.<br/>Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2008 4:19:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>&gt; Carl a while back I think you stated that you considered harmony<br/>&gt; as being meta-harmoinics.</p><p>Meta-timbre, yes.
