It will make the time needed to learn the program<br/>much shorter. It&apos;s essentially the same as version 1.7 in terms of<br/>functionality, but with a GUI &quot;wrapped around it&quot;.<br/>The most important commands have been put into the menu, and some<br/>windows were added to edit and view a scale, see the command history,<br/>etc.<br/>It doesn&apos;t have the standard Windows look and that&apos;s because it is made<br/>with a multi-platform GUI toolkit, Gtk+. So Unix and Linux versions can<br/>still be made. This toolkit is very powerful and I&apos;ve only used a<br/>fraction yet of what it can do.<br/>This release is still under development somewhat so it may be changed<br/>a bit later if any deficiencies are uncovered.<br/>The program looks fine on my big workstation screen, but if it looks<br/>too big on a small PC screen, try setting the screen size in pixels<br/>higher, or choose a smaller text font (set in file params.par).<br/>Later I plan to put more graphic functionality in it, like better<br/>lattice diagrams and interval graphs and such.<br/>Any suggestions for improvement are welcome.</p><p>Scala version 2.0 Alpha for Windows 98/NT is now online, the file is:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/scala20win-a.zip">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/scala20win-a.zip</a></p><p>The homepage is <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/</a></p><p>Scala is a very complete freeware editor/librarian/analysis tool for<br/>tunings. It allows scales to be created, manipulated and combined in<br/>many different ways. A large library of scales is available for it. It<br/>can tune various different synthesizers and samplers via standard<br/>MIDI-files. To install, unpack <a href="http://scala20win-a.zip">scala20win-a.zip</a> in an empty directory<br/>and read the readme.txt file.<br/>There is no installshield, perhaps in the future, but installation by<br/>hand is not very difficult. The dll-files in the Scala bin directory<br/>must be put in PATH, use &quot;msconfig&quot; or &quot;notepad c:\autoexec.bat&quot; to<br/>do this, and then reboot. Suppose you made a new directory C:\Scala20<br/>it&apos;s best to add the following line:<br/>PATH=C:\SCALA20\BIN;%PATH%<br/>Instead of rebooting, you can open a DOS window, type &quot;c:\autoexec&quot;,<br/>go to the Scala directory and type &quot;scala&quot;. Copying the dll-files to<br/>c:\windows\system is possible too but not recommended because they<br/>will be changed with new versions.<br/>Maybe interesting, this is the first Scala version entirely made with<br/>free tools.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2001 8:18:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17683">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17683</a></p><p>Congratulations to Manuel op de Coul for making a new Windows version<br/>of Scala.</p><p>However, so far I have had nothing but problems with it.</p><p>For some reason, I couldn&apos;t get the path to register the .dlls<br/>properly.
