For sine waves, there&apos;s not much<br/>difference between just and irrational intervals. Though some on this list<br/>have debated this assertion in the context of harmonic scales that extend<br/>high up the series, it sounds like you&apos;re exploring just intonation beyond<br/>just a single harmonic scale. I&apos;d suggest you try a slightly richer timbre<br/>and see if the intervals seem to acquire more &quot;meaning&quot;.</p></div>
