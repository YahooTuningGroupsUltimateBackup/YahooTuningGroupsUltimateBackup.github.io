The result is two<br/>&gt;       parralel chains of a linear temperament, and I think Petr has also<br/>&gt;       used this feature.</p><p>Hello, Jacques!</p><p>As it happens, what you are describing is the structure of some of<br/>my favorite temperaments, including one that I&apos;m planning to use<br/>for lots of my &quot;Margo Schulter&apos;s Ethno Extras&quot; as you have titled<br/>them, a title I accept with due humility, especially as lots of them<br/>will be &quot;Margo&apos;s Variations on Jacques Dudon&apos;s Ethno and Related<br/>Tunings.&quot;</p><p>&gt;       They can be considered as a subsets of planar temperaments, but I<br/>&gt;       wanted to know if a special nomenclature existed (I call them myself<br/>&gt;       &quot;Ribbon temperaments&quot;), and if some known emblematic temperaments<br/>&gt;       show this specific 3D feature.</p><p>While I&apos;ve been very actively using these for about eight years, and just<br/>in the last month and a bit more have devised a new one, I must admit<br/>that I haven&apos;t come up with a good descriptive name for the genre, and<br/>&quot;Ribbon temperaments&quot; sounds fine to me.</p><p>People sometimes speak of &quot;Bicycle chain&quot; temperaments, but this tends to<br/>imply that each &quot;chain&quot; forms a circulating structure, often of an EDO<br/>type (e.g. 36-EDO as three chains of 12-EDO spaced at 33-1/3 cents apart.</p><p>My first application of this principle, as I recall, was actually with<br/>Pythagorean tuning: two 12-note chains (Eb-G#, evidently a typical<br/>14th-century European tuning) at a 64:63 apart (27.26 cents), which<br/>in effect meant an extended fifth at G#-D# connecting the two 12-note<br/>chains, a fifth wide by about 3.804 cents, comparable to 17-EDO and<br/>slightly wider than the basic generator in Aulos/Soria.</p><p>That was not, of course, a &quot;temperament,&quot; and nor was Sesquisexta of<br/>earlier 2001, two 12-note chains of 3:2 fifths at a pure 7:6 apart<br/>(sesquisexta being the Latin term for a ratio of 7:6).</p><p>However, I would say that Peppermint is an emblematic example. The<br/>2:1 octave is the period. The &quot;Noble fifth&quot; generator of 704.096 cents<br/>was suggested by Keenan Pepper in September 2000: this is an extended<br/>fifth which produces a temperament where the apotome or chromatic<br/>semitone (128.669 cents) and limma or diatonic semitone (79.522 cents)<br/>have the ratio of Phi between their logarithmic sizes.</p><p>In 2002, from Pepper&apos;s regular temperament, I developed the 24-note<br/>Peppermint tuning, with two 12-note chains at 58.680 cents apart,<br/>the different between the regular Pepper major second at 208.191 cents<br/>and a pure 7:6 (266.071 cents). This arrangements gives a very<br/>accurate division of 11:12:13:14, or as applied to a 4:3, something<br/>like 33:36:39:42:44.</p><p>One way of viewing the ribbon structure (in Tuning list terminology,<br/>planar or rank 3) is to note that each 12-note chain produces near-just<br/>ratios of 11:13:14 (the 14:11 major third, 13:11 minor third, and 14:13<br/>apotome), while the two chains together add 12:11, 13:12 -- and, of<br/>course, the septimal intervals including the pure 7:6 that, less the<br/>regular Pepper major second or tone, defines the third generator.</p><p>An interesting feature is that the &quot;artificial diesis&quot; or generator<br/>defining the space between the two chains of this ribbon temperament,<br/>58.680 cents, serves to represent both 28:27 (the septimal thirdtone<br/>or semitone of Archytas, e.g. 9/8-7/6) and 33:32 (e.g. 12/11-9/8).</p><p>This temperament is available in the Scala scale archive as schulter_pepr.scl.</p><p>Here I should mention that George Secor&apos;s HTT-29, his &quot;High Tolerance<br/>Temperament&quot; in 29 notes, makes use of a similar principle, and thus<br/>certainly influenced me in applying the &quot;ribbon&quot; feature to Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s regular temperament (earlier noted on Erv Wilson&apos;s Scale<br/>Tree and as Golden Horagram 26). However, HTT-29 has other refinements<br/>that make it more complex in structure than a simple &quot;ribbon<br/>temperament&quot; of the kind we are discussing.</p><p>&gt;       The other question concerning some of my investigations (that can<br/>&gt;       also be found in Ethno2) is about temperaments that would use a<br/>&gt;       certain generator, and after a certain number of reiterations would<br/>&gt;       shift to another generator. I call them &quot;Hybrid&quot; temperaments.<br/>&gt;       In more particular cases they would come back to the starting point,<br/>&gt;       and I call them &quot;Double face temperaments&quot;. I have been using that on<br/>&gt;       12 tones keyboard mappings, where for example the white keys from F<br/>&gt;       to B would use a meantone generator, that shifts on black keys, from<br/>&gt;       B or F# back to Bb or F or whatever to a superpyth. (Multi-system<br/>&gt;       EA7, NA6, SEA9). A WT like Comptine (1/4 pyth. comma meantone<br/>&gt;       sequence from C to E, completed by 8 pure fifths) could also be<br/>&gt;       considered a special case of those, where one of the generators is a<br/>&gt;       perfect fifth.</p><p>This sounds like the kind of technique used in my Zest-24, or &quot;Zarlino<br/>Encompassing Spectrum Temperament&quot; with two 12-note circles, each<br/>with eight 2/7-comma meantone fifths (695.810 cents) at F-C#, and<br/>four extended fifths of 708.379 cents at C#/Db-F. The two circles<br/>are placed at the distance of 50.276 cents, the diesis of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>regular 2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>Since this doesn&apos;t seem present in the most recent version of the<br/>Scala archive I downloaded the other day, I&apos;ll post it here:</p><p>! zest24.scl<br/>!<br/>Zarlino Encompassing Spectrum Temperament (two circles at ~50.28c apart)<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 50.27584<br/> 25/24<br/> 120.94826<br/> 191.62069<br/> 241.89653<br/> 287.43104<br/> 337.70688<br/> 383.24139<br/> 433.51722<br/> 504.18965<br/> 554.46549<br/> 574.86208<br/> 625.13792<br/> 695.81035<br/> 746.08619<br/> 779.05173<br/> 829.32757<br/> 887.43104<br/> 937.70688<br/> 995.81035<br/> 1046.08619<br/> 1079.05173<br/> 48/25<br/> 2/1</p><p>There are lots of hemifourths, which I used in _La Pacifica_.</p><p>Gene Ward Smith has also designed a number of these &quot;Hybrid&quot;<br/>temperaments, with Cauldron as one name that occurs to me.</p><p>&gt;       Then I have a third case between the two precedents, where 2<br/>&gt;       different generators are used in succession according to some<br/>&gt;       specific patterns, without necessarily making a circle (SEA3) - I<br/>&gt;       have been calling those &quot;Entrelacs&quot; (= Interlace, Intertwine,<br/>&gt;       Tracery ?).</p><p>While this equivalence is a new concept to me, I much like the term &quot;Entrelacs&quot; or &quot;Interlace.&quot;</p><p>&gt;       Simple zig-zag alternance of the two generators would be of course<br/>&gt;       equivalent to a &quot;ribbon temperament&quot; (where one of the generators is<br/>&gt;       defined differently).<br/>&gt;       - - - - - - -</p><p>From looking at your septimal_3.scl in Ethno2 (7 Indonesia), I think I may<br/>understand this idea.
