That&apos;s not necessary for this<br/>&gt;application.</p><p>&gt;The easy way to do it in real time is just use a standard<br/>&gt;pitch shift algorithm. Let&apos;s say you need to shift the brainwaves<br/>&gt;up by 3 octaves - a factor of 8. So we grab snippets and<br/>&gt;each snippet will get played 8 times at a rate of 8 times the<br/>&gt;original.<br/>... [lots more snipped]</p><p>Jeff, I don&apos;t believe that such a scheme can work properly because in<br/>repeating a segment a bunch of frequencies are created at the repeat<br/>frequency.  Even if this is removed by some scheme the continuity<br/>(phase) of sounds at ALL frequencies cannot be achieved except by<br/>actually continuing from the correct phase which may have no<br/>relationship to the sample repetition rate.</p><p>Jeff, I really enjoyed your articles about digital synthesis<br/>methodology.

I may have oversimplified how it works<br/>at the beginning of the email, but the part where I describe a<br/>two-tapped delay line with complementary envelopes is good to go.<br/>Try it and see. That is the method used in most digital effects<br/>boxes and the generic &apos;pitch-shift&apos; algorithms in a lot of software<br/>(the real pricey modern effects do FFTs with formant correction<br/>but none of the older ones do because real-time FFTs weren&apos;t technically<br/>feasible until recently).</p><p>As far as your comments on phase go, you should know that FFT<br/>blocks are also reassembled using the overlap-add method with<br/>windowing. The reason this is done is because just about any<br/>kind of processing will result is scrambled phases. A lot<br/>of FFT code throws out all the phase information (by forcing<br/>the phases to zero) as its first step since it&apos;s just taking<br/>up space. I speak from experience here. You can also read<br/>&quot;Elements of Computer Music&quot; by Dick Moore and look at the<br/>SoundHack manual. I would expect that csound&apos;s lpc unit<br/>also does overlap add (although it does make use of the phase<br/>info - the Settel/Lippe harmonic separation widget in SoundHack<br/>is another algorithm that uses phase info, but even these<br/>things overlap-add to reassemble.</p><p>I&apos;ve personally created a couple of real-time pitch shifters<br/>with this method and I can vouch for it.</p><p>Though I admit that I&apos;ve never shifted anything up more than<br/>four octaves with it.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Jeff</p></div>
