Any Arabic music that is played with a string orchestra, or<br/>is on an Arabic TV program, etc., you can be pretty sure uses steps<br/>close to 150 cents.

Turkish, Persian, and Arabic styles are all different as<br/>regards both theory and practice. There are some similarities, and<br/>significant cross-cultural influences, of course, but the musics<br/>remain distinct.</p></div>
