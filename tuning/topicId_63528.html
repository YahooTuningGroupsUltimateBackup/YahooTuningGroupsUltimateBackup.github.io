So the combined signal will be:</p><p>a*sin(2pi*xt) + b*cos(2pi*xt) + c*sin(2pi*yt) + d*cos(2pi*yt)</p><p>If you know your basic Fourier theory, you&apos;ll know that there are no<br/>other frequency components besides x and y in this signal. If x and y<br/>are very close, the ear will be unable to resolve them, and this<br/>results in a beating (a separate demonstration).</p><p>When there is a quadratic nonlinearity, the output signal (out) can<br/>be written as a function of the input signal (inp) as:</p><p>out = f*inp^2 + g*inp + h,</p><p>where f, g, and h are constants. Plugging in the combined signal<br/>above, we have</p><p>out =</p><p>f*(a*sin(2pi*xt) + b*cos(2pi*xt) + c*sin(2pi*yt) + d*cos(2pi*yt))^2<br/>+ g*(a*sin(2pi*xt) + b*cos(2pi*xt) + c*sin(2pi*yt) + d*cos(2pi*yt))<br/>+ h</p><p>= f*((a*sin(2pi*xt))^2 + (b*cos(2pi*xt))^2 + (c*sin(2pi*yt))^2 +<br/>(d*cos(2pi*yt))^2 + 2*a*sin(2pi*xt)*b*cos(2pi*xt) + 2*a*sin(2pi*xt)<br/>*c*sin(2pi*yt) + 2*a*sin(2pi*xt)*d*cos(2pi*yt) + 2*b*cos(2pi*xt)*c*sin<br/>(2pi*yt) + 2*b*cos(2pi*xt)*d*cos(2pi*yt) + 2*c*sin(2pi*yt)*d*cos<br/>(2pi*yt))<br/>+ g*(a*sin(2pi*xt) + b*cos(2pi*xt) + c*sin(2pi*yt) + d*cos(2pi*yt))<br/>+ h</p><p>Using the following trigonometric identities,</p><p>sin(x)*sin(y) = (cos(x - y) - cos(x + y))/2<br/>sin(x)*cos(y) = (sin(x + y) + sin(x Â– y))/2<br/>cos(x)*cos(y) = (cos(x - y) + cos(x + y))/2</p><p>we can derive these additional ones easily:</p><p>(sin(x))^2 = 1/2 - cos(2x)/2<br/>(cos(x))^2 = 1/2 + cos(2x)/2<br/>sin(x)*cos(x) = sin(2x)/2</p><p>We also note the antisymmetry of the sine function:</p><p>sin(-x) = -sin(x)</p><p>and using all six, we rewrite the expression for the output as</p><p>out = f*(a^2*(1/2 - cos(4pi*xt)) + b^2*(1/2 + cos(4pi*xt)) + c^2*<br/>(1/2 - cos(4pi*yt)) + d^2*(1/2 + cos(4pi*yt)) + ab*sin(4pi*xt) + ac*<br/>(cos(2pi*(x-y)t) - cos(2pi*(x+y)t)) + ad*(sin(2pi*(x+y)t) + sin(2pi*<br/>(x-y)t)) + bc*(sin(2pi*(x+y)t) + sin(2pi*(y-x)t)) + bd*(cos(2pi*(x-y)<br/>t) + cos(2pi*(x+y)t)) + cd*(sin(4pi*yt)))<br/>+ g*(a*sin(2pi*xt) + b*cos(2pi*xt) + c*sin(2pi*yt) + d*cos(2pi*yt))<br/>+ h</p><p>= a^2*f/2 + b^2*f/2 + c^2*f/2 + d*2*f/2<br/>+ (b^2 - a^2)*f*cos(4pi*xt) + (d^2 - c^2)*f*cos(4pi*yt)<br/>+ abf*sin(4pi*xt) + cdf*sin(4pi*yt)<br/>+ (bd + ac)*f*cos(2pi*(x-y)t) + (bd - ac)*f*cos(2pi*(x+y)t)<br/>+ (ad - bc)*f*sin(2pi*(x-y)t) + (ad + ab)*f*sin(2pi*(x+y)t)<br/>+ g*(a*sin(2pi*xt) + b*cos(2pi*xt) + c*sin(2pi*yt) + d*cos(2pi*yt))<br/>+ h</p><p>Terms with cos(4pi*xt) and sin(4pi*xt) represent frequency components<br/>at a frequency of 2x. These can&apos;t both be zero since, for the first<br/>to be zero, a must equal b, while for the second to be zero, a or b<br/>must equal zero. Since we&apos;ve already assumed a and b are not both<br/>zero, these conditions can&apos;t both be true at once; hence the output<br/>signal a components at frequency 2x.</p><p>If I haven&apos;t lost you yet (and please let me know if/where I have),<br/>you should be able to continue this line of reasoning and see that<br/>frequency components of 2x, 2y, x+y, and x-y are all in the signal if<br/>f&gt;0; that is, if there is a quadratic nonlinearity.</p><p>Part 2:</p><p>The hearing apparatus has a finite frequency resolution; this is a<br/>mathematical necessity when you consider that we need to hear<br/>*changes* in the world happening in time (due to the classical<br/>uncertainty principle).</p><p>Hence a signal containing two very close frequencies at constant and<br/>equal amplitude will be heard as a single pitch whose amplitude<br/>changes over time.</p><p>The trig identities we need are the ones like</p><p>sin(x) + sin(y) = 2*sin((x+y)/2)*cos((x-y)/2)</p><p>I don&apos;t think I need to bring cosines in for full generality but I<br/>welcome you to do so if you wish.</p><p>Anyway, what this identity tells us is that adding two equal-<br/>amplitude sine waves very close in frequency is the same thing as<br/>amplitude-modulating a sine wave at the average frequency by a cosine<br/>wave at half the difference frequency. Since the cosine is zero twice<br/>per cycle, and reaches its maximum absolute value twice per cycle,<br/>the average-frequency sine wave will be heard to oscillate in<br/>loudness at twice the modulation frequency, or twice half the<br/>difference frequency, which of course equals the difference frequency.</p><p>If the ear is unable to resolve the two frequencies, the right side<br/>of the equation is more directly relevant to how we hear the signal.<br/>On the other hand, if the ear can distinguish them, the right side<br/>becomes completely irrelevant to how we hear. However, it still may<br/>be a relevant representation of a particular method of sound<br/>synthesis; namely amplitude modulation. In that case, you reverse the<br/>direction in which you read the equation: the left side tells you<br/>what &quot;goes in&quot; in terms of how the AM is specified; the right side<br/>tells you what the frequency components are. These are<br/>called &apos;sidebands&apos; because they normally straddle the modulated<br/>frequency at equal frequency intervals on either side of it. And if<br/>they are different enough, you hear them separately -- this is the<br/>regime where AM results in audible sideband frequencies. When the<br/>sidebands cannot be resolved, though, the original AM specification<br/>on the right side of the equation becomes a direct description of how<br/>we hear the sound -- as a single pitch modulated in amplitude at a<br/>fairly slow rate.</p><p>The exact frequency ratios, over the entire spectrum of audible<br/>absolute frequencies, that are just large enough to permit two sine<br/>waves to be resolved separately, have been measured in a large body<br/>of experiments on human subjects. They vary greatly over the<br/>spectrum, but never become narrower than a whole tone (nearing it<br/>only an an optimal &quot;middle&quot; absolute frequency range). Thankfully, we<br/>rarely use a single pair of pure sine waves to make music!</p></div><h3><a id=63557 href="#63557">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 6:14:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>On Fri, 20 Jan 2006 &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Part 1 is on quadratic combinational tones<br/>&gt; Part 2 (scroll down) is about beating.<br/>&gt;<br/>And very good explanations I found them, too!<br/>Thanks, Paul.</p><p>&gt; Part 1:<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; When there is a quadratic nonlinearity, the output signal (out) can<br/>&gt; be written as a function of the input signal (inp) as:</p><p>And when will we expect to find a quadratic<br/>nonlinearity, and why?

The ear, for<br/>example, can&apos;t respond in a linear way to arbitrarily large<br/>vibrations. At some point, increasing the amplitude of the vibrations<br/>by a given proportion will result in the amplitude of the ear&apos;s<br/>response increasing in a smaller proportion. The entire response<br/>function can be expanded (or decomposed) into a series of terms with<br/>different exponents; the first term is the linear terms, and the<br/>second term is the quadratic term. Ultimately, much higher and higher-<br/>order terms must have smaller and smaller coefficients on them so<br/>that the expansion of the response function can converge to a limit<br/>(as well as satisfy conservation of energy, etc.)</p><p>&gt; Is it also the case<br/>&gt; that a quadratic function is also a good<br/>&gt; approximation to a higher-order nonlinearity?</p><p>This is normally the true if the nonlinearity is symmetrical and the<br/>signal is weak. Then the higher-order terms, which will all be even-<br/>order, will be weaker than the quadratic terms.</p><p>The ear and/or brain appear to have some *cubic* nonlinearities,<br/>implying an asymmetrical response function, though.
