(I know this piece better than almost any<br/>other classical work--I&apos;ve listened to it at least 500 times, literally, and<br/>I&apos;ve learned the solo part, which is a bitch) Yours sounds like a dirge. I<br/>had to turn it off, as it was painful to try and sit through a tempo that<br/>slow for that most energetic and masculine of movements.
