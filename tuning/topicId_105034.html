Let&apos;s even just say that we&apos;re sticking to rank-2.</p><p>1) Pick the temperament of your choice.<br/>2) Pick a reasonably-sized diatonic-sized MOS to use.<br/>3) Pick a reasonably-sized chromatic-sized MOS to use.<br/>4) Play whatever harmony you want, dynamically changing to different<br/>modes and MODMOS&apos;s of #2 to accommodate the harmony you want.<br/>5) (MOST IMPORTANT) Play whatever harmony you want, dynamically<br/>changing to different modes and MODMOS&apos;s of #3 that you use to<br/>accommodate what you want to do.</p><p>What I really like is the effect of #3 combined with #5. This is<br/>because I really just crave the sound of there being clearly defined<br/>regions of interval space that I know can do different musical things<br/>(like sound like 3/2, or whatever). I don&apos;t really care if you shift<br/>notes by comma or diesis within those regions for different chords, I<br/>just like to know what those regions are.</p><p>For me, if I ever hear a composition that subverts the above process,<br/>I feel disoriented, like I&apos;m listening to a &quot;microtonal&quot; piece. So if<br/>you&apos;re just playing what to my ears sound like random otonal chords<br/>that are running amok all over the place, I still might like the<br/>sound, but there&apos;s some layer of musical enjoyment that&apos;s lost for me.<br/>But if you&apos;re playing in porcupine in 22-EDO, for instance, but you<br/>take reasonable care to always emphasize some quasi-equal 15-note set<br/>- even if you sometimes shift notes around in those regions to<br/>accommodate the harmony you want - I can actually hear a very clear<br/>sense of background &quot;scale&quot; at that point, so I&apos;m much happier.</p><p>I don&apos;t even know if this applies to anyone other than me*, but it<br/>definitely applies to me. My hypothesis is that it&apos;s because I&apos;m<br/>basically an idiot, and I need clever cognitive strategies so that my<br/>feeble brain can actually comprehend what&apos;s going on at all. Kind of<br/>like how I&apos;m not actually smart enough to imagine 1,234,567 things,<br/>but I have a decent grasp of the number 1,234,567 because its Arabic<br/>numeral representation is easy enough to figure out. I dunno if this<br/>would lead to some holy grail of interval &quot;functions&quot; or &quot;xentonality&quot;<br/>or whatever, but I do think it would be nice to experiment with music<br/>that has a clearly defined set of &quot;notes&quot; as a first pass, even if<br/>they wiggle around a little bit!</p><p>Anyway, just a suggestion for the people who are inspired and<br/>composing these days, aka not me right now.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>*This is a lie</p><p>PS: I&apos;m specifically looking forward to experiencing what it&apos;s like to<br/>do the above with porcupine[15], or some 15-note Fokker block. It<br/>would be awesome to have 15 separate regions of interval space that I<br/>all know can do these very clearly defined psychoacoustic things,<br/>sometimes requiring some shifts in intonation. My instinctive vision<br/>of it is that it&apos;d be like a more enlightened way of understanding how<br/>your auditory system works, or something.</p></div>
