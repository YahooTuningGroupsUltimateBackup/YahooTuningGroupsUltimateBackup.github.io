Academic music, or just academic<br/>&gt; music at UCSD (where I believe Puckette is based)?</p><p>I&apos;ll post the link to the whole article later -- he<br/>speaks on behalf of american academic/university music.</p><p>&gt;&gt; unlistenable music. To compare our music to that of<br/>&gt;&gt; north India by asking which is the more complex is<br/>&gt;&gt; simply ludicrous.&quot; -- Miller Puckette<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who asks this?</p><p>It&apos;s a rhetorical device -- he means to say that it is<br/>self-evident that North Indian music is more complex<br/>than American academic music.</p><p>He brings this up in the context that an apparent goal<br/>of academic music is ever increasing level of<br/>complexity &amp; that the complexity pursued is of an<br/>structural and theoretical nature, rather than musical.<br/>He points out that North Indian music is more complex<br/>and yet is still musical and listenable, whereas<br/>American academic music is unmusical and unlistenable,<br/>as is evidenced by the lack of interest of audiences<br/>for western music outside of those who have been<br/>conditioned through the grist mill of academia. This<br/>contrasts with the far more sophisticated and complex<br/>North Indian music which finds wide and appreciative<br/>audiences.</p><p>&gt;&gt; awarded Ph.D. degrees, although art historians or<br/>&gt;&gt; theorists are; their output is not works of art but<br/>&gt;&gt; scholarly prose.&quot; --  Miller Puckette, 1999<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm . . . . I wonder what one would call the<br/>&gt; &quot;output&quot; of mailing lists. . . . .</p><p>BINGO!!!</p><p>-- you win the prize --</p></div>
