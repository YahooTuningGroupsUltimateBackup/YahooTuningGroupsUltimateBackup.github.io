Although I had worked<br/>extensively with synthesis of just intonation intervals,<br/>chords, and musical passages, I was very surprised to<br/>hear an ordinary &quot;house piano&quot; - a regular old piano - in first<br/>1/6 comma mean tone temperament and then 1/4 comma<br/>MT and finally JI.  To me it seemed almost<br/>unbelievable that a piano, the proud champion of<br/>EQT&apos;s supremacy, could have such a &quot;change of heart&quot; when<br/>tuned differently.  This is not some laboriously souped up<br/>reconstructed instrument, it&apos;s a plain 12 pitch per octave<br/>piano - but it sounds so different!  You lose the circle<br/>of 12 playable keys, but you can still do a lot with fewer<br/>than that.</p><p>Dave Hill, La Mesa, CA</p></div><h3><a id=7037 href="#7037">ðŸ”—</a>mandlixon &#x3C;mandldixon@xxxxxx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/1999 6:12:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Welcome, Dave Hill.</p><p>It has taken me a few days to check back on the tuning list.<br/>I bought your cassettes and booklet a couple of years ago and found them<br/>very interesting.<br/>However I do find the balance of chords awkard to listen to from<br/>sythesizers.  For instance I think<br/>a dominant 7th as 4:5:6:7 sounds much better when the balance (of dynamics)<br/>favours the root and dominant, the third sounding slightly less and the 7th<br/>less again.  I don&apos;t suppose computers can make this sort of adjustment now?<br/>My orchestral colleagues and I get amuch better result tuning when we adjust<br/>balance.  Of course with your experiments on the piano these sort of<br/>subtleties can happen readily.  Of course the balance thing might not seem<br/>an issue to many.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Michael Hugh Dixon</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: <a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>Date: Sunday, 12 December 1999 17:39<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Intonational Systems Earlier Musicians had in Mind</p><p>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hello -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I appreciate encouraging comments made on my<br/>&gt;recent post.
