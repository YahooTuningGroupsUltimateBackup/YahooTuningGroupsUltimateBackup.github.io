Until<br/>you do so and are able to sustain such a challenge, I suggest you yourself<br/>refrain from any further use of the letters &quot;L&quot; or &quot;s&quot; in your postings and<br/>other writing and further refrain from any harassment of other scholars who<br/>use said letters.</p><p>Daniel J.
