What department?  Usually<br/>people don&apos;t do dissertations in subject areas with which they are not<br/>familiar.</p><p>&gt; my main question is:<br/>&gt; What constraints on dance music producers are there to conform to tones<br/>and semi tones &gt; away from microtones</p><p>If I might be so bold... Perhaps you are asking the wrong question, or it<br/>is not sufficiently contextualized for people on this list to help you.<br/>For example, who are &quot;dance music producers&quot;?</p><p>A better question might be...</p><p>&#x9;Why do most dance music producers _not_ work with microtonal music?</p><p>And I think the answer to that lies in the weight of history, tradition,<br/>musical education, aural conservatism, advertising media, peer pressure,<br/>etc.  Ultimately, this boils down to the question:</p><p>&#x9;Why isn&apos;t microtonal music more popular?</p><p>&gt; so far ive discovered ives and cage could any one lead me along the right path?</p><p>For the mostpart, Ives and Cage were not microtonal composers.  If that&apos;s<br/>all you&apos;ve discovered so far, you have a long road ahead.  I presume you<br/>have a major music library at your disposal. Try looking up Harry Partch<br/>for starters.</p><p>Here&apos;s another tack... Carnatic music (i.e., South Indian classical music)<br/>is &quot;microtonal&quot;... and there is a very very strong tradition of dance that<br/>is very popular.  Here in the San Fran Bay Area, there must be 30 south<br/>Indian classical dance recitals a year.  It&apos;s really popular.</p><p>How about Balinese music?  It&apos;s &quot;microtonal&quot;, and there&apos;s a very strong<br/>living tradition of dance.  Lots of people do it, and it&apos;s performed<br/>widely.  There are several such performances per year right here in this<br/>area by Gamelan Sekar Jaya.</p><p>Hope that helps...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p><p>&#xFFFD;</p></div><h3><a id=23942 href="#23942">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2000 12:16:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Partch used very complex meters (not necessarily rhythms)<br/>in much of his work.

Once the dosh rolls in it&apos;s playsafe city. The second<br/>&gt; constraint is the music industry which isn&apos;t very good at supporting<br/>&gt; creative tools for making microtonal instruments.

Her work is possibly outside the paradigm<br/>you have in mind, but it&apos;s worth mentioning. The productions involved<br/>dancers creating and controlling electronic sound through choreographed<br/>movements. I was one of the musical collaborators. The theremins were not<br/>used to produce audible pitches in the way people usually associate with<br/>theremins but rather were used to produce a control signal that represent<br/>the dancer&apos;s position. The control signal then controls other musical<br/>parameters of sound produced using two Putney VCS-3 synthesisers. A variety<br/>of antennae were used. Some of these can be seen in Writings on Dance (4)<br/>(L Dempster (ed.) 1989 Victoria, Australia) including a platform on which<br/>the dancer moves, their body being an extension of the electromagnetic<br/>field surrounding the antenna. I still have this platform antenna. I still<br/>have some of the circuitry I developed in 1974 which differentiated the<br/>position signal, to produce velocity and acceleration. There are a number<br/>of published references I can give you if you think this is relevant.</p><p>This is not as off topic as it might seem as the pitch continuum in these<br/>performances represented an infinite variety of microtones and the dancers<br/>were no more informed about ways to organise these pitches than most<br/>musicians. There were no scores that prescribed in detail the pitches used<br/>in these performances.</p><p>Greg S</p></div><h3><a id=23995 href="#23995">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 7:32:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Greg!<br/>    Remember these old war horses well! even playing 31 ET.</p><p>Greg Schiemer wrote:</p><p>&gt; The control signal then controls other musical<br/>&gt; parameters of sound produced using two Putney VCS-3 synthesisers.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=24089 href="#24089">ðŸ”—</a>J P Fitch &#x3C;jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 6:54:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE</p><p>TURN OFF HTML MAIL</p><p>I woudl liek to think you were posting sense, buty it is<br/>indestiguishable from the spam I get.<br/>==John ff</p><p>&lt;DIV&gt;<br/>&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>&lt;P&gt;&gt;thank you for your help it will come in most handy&lt;/P&gt;<br/>&lt;P&gt;i have looked at partch too!!!!!&lt;/P&gt;<br/>&lt;P&gt;thank you again&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br/>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>&lt;!-- |**|begin egp html banner|**| --&gt;</p><p>etc etc etc</p></div><h3><a id=24093 href="#24093">ðŸ”—</a>John F.
