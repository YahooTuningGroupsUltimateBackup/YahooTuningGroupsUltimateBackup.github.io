When reaching maximum point, one could have<br/>several members of some of the groups downloading their<br/>archives simultaneously, each unaware of the other&apos;s activities.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying this will happen, or is even likely, but if there<br/>is even a small chance of it, one wants to take precautions<br/>to prevent it happening.</p><p>There is nothing to limit it because of the way e-mail can<br/>be passed on so quickly, and one knows how fast chain letters<br/>and the like spread.</p><p>Would the yahoo servers be up to the task of serving the entire<br/>archives of the majority of the groups simultaneously, if it<br/>came to that? Or would everyone find that for a while they<br/>couldn&apos;t access the posts at all?</p><p>Do you see the point, and the reason for caution?</p><p>It does also seem to be a new program, and to fill a need,<br/>and I don&apos;t know of any other way to do it that is available,<br/>so we have no precedents to go by.</p><p>Of course, once the zips are made, and generally available, that<br/>reduces the load on the servers, as those who have them can do<br/>searches in the zips instead of on-line.</p><p>One idea I have is to have a special ftp address that the program<br/>could call up, and see if it is okay to continue with the ftp.</p><p>Could be one I manage myself, or one managed by Yahoo.</p><p>Could just be a file that has to be there, and if deleted,<br/>stops all instances of the program from doing ftp - that would<br/>be like an emergency cord, and would be sufficient if one<br/>was pretty sure it would never be needed.</p><p>Could be a file in the tuning group files area in fact,<br/>so that one can be sure that if the Yahoo groups are<br/>available, then one will be able to access it.</p><p>Or could be something more sophisticated, a perl program<br/>or java servlet that would return a message, say,<br/>&quot;There are xxx instances of this program ftp-ing<br/>archives simultaneously right now, and so you will be<br/>limited to n ftp tries every minute until the numbers<br/>go down&quot;, or &quot; there are xxx instances running, so you<br/>need to wait for one of them to exit before continuing&quot;.</p><p>and the program displays that message, and will only continue<br/>if the message returned is, say, &quot;OK&quot;.</p><p>Whatever I do, I think I&apos;ll have to contact Yahoo, perhaps<br/>when the program has been beta testing.</p><p>However I may add in the &quot;emergency cord&quot; idea for the<br/>beta test, as I will then be happier about making the<br/>beta widely available, say, for anyone on the TL to use,<br/>or something like that.</p><p>I should finish the ftp of the entire TL archive fairly soon<br/>- been doing it gradually while debugging and am doing<br/>messages 8000 to 10000 at present.</p><p>As with you, I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve said some silly things on the list,<br/>and certainly lots of things that were incorrect and had<br/>to be corrected later. I&apos;m sure nearly everyone has.</p><p>However, when one looks at the archive, what strikes one is<br/>the variety and richness of the ideas, and I find it very<br/>impressive in fact.</p><p>So, on the whole, can&apos;t imagine anyone will mind, especially<br/>since they are available on-line anyway, and as you say,<br/>hardly any kind of comercial prospect!</p><p>As for the size of the messages:</p><p>Yes, they are a bit larger in html.</p><p>However, they need to be in html for the links to work.</p><p>Links do also work in e-mail programs in messages that<br/>appear to be plain text. However, they can&apos;t be plain<br/>text entirely, at least, the edit control that one<br/>types into can&apos;t be plain text (the archives of the<br/>messages could be, auto converted when read) because<br/>plain text doesn&apos;t include support for hyperlinks.</p><p>They are very probably in rich edit format in fact,<br/>as that is one of the standard windows controls, and<br/>does have some support for hyperlinks.</p><p>Rich edit needs more space than html:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk</a></p><p>saved as a single document in Word in rtf format is</p><p>{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\uc1<br/>\deff0\deflang1033\deflangfe1033{\fonttbl{\f0\froman\fcharset0\fprq2{\*\panose<br/>02020603050405020304}Times New<br/>Roman;}}{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blu<br/>e0;<br/>\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255;\red0\gr<br/>een0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;\red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128;\red128\green0\blue0<br/>;\red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;<br/>\red192\green192\blue192;}{\stylesheet{\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\cgrid \snext0 Normal;}{\*\cs10<br/>\additive Default Paragraph Font;}{\*\cs15 \additive \ul\cf2 \sbasedon10 Hyperlink;}}{\info{\title<br/>www}{\author Robert Walker}{\operator Robert Walker}<br/>{\creatim\yr2001\mo4\dy1\min19}{\revtim\yr2001\mo4\dy1\min19}{\version2}{\edmins0}{\nofpages1}{\nofw<br/>ords0}{\nofchars0}{\*\company  }{\nofcharsws0}{\vern89}}\margl1440\margr1440<br/>\widowctrl\ftnbj\aenddoc\formshade\viewkind1\viewscale102\viewzk2\pgbrdrhead\pgbrdrfoot \fet0\sectd<br/>\linex0\headery1440\footery1440\sectdefaultcl<br/>{\*\pnseclvl1\pnucrm\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang{\pntxta<br/>.}}{\*\pnseclvl2\pnucltr\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang<br/>{\pntxta .}}{\*\pnseclvl3\pndec\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang{\pntxta<br/>.}}{\*\pnseclvl4\pnlcltr\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang{\pntxta )}}{\*\pnseclvl5\pndec\pnstart1\pninden<br/>t720\pnhang{\pntxtb (}{\pntxta )}}{\*\pnseclvl6\pnlcltr\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang<br/>{\pntxtb (}{\pntxta )}}{\*\pnseclvl7\pnlcrm\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang{\pntxtb<br/>(}{\pntxta )}}{\*\pnseclvl8\pnlcltr\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang{\pntxtb<br/>(}{\pntxta )}}{\*\pnseclvl9\pnlcrm\pnstart1\pnindent720\pnhang{\pntxtb (}{\pntxta )}}\pard\plain<br/>\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\cgrid {\field{\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK<br/>&quot;<a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk</a>&quot;}{{\*\datafield<br/>00d0c9ea79f9bace118c8200aa004ba90b0200000003000000e0c9ea79f9bace118c8200aa004ba90b440000006800740074<br/>0070003a002f002f007700770077002e0072006f006200650072007400770061006c006b00650072002e00660039002e0063<br/>006f002e0075006b002f000000}}}{\fldrslt {\cs15\ul\cf2<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk</a>}}}{<br/>\par<br/>\par }}</p><p>Much of that is probably redundant, but it would still take a lot of space.</p><p>By comparison, html is pretty compact!</p><p>I can reduce the actual disk space needed, by placing several posts to a page,<br/>as there is a minimum size for a file - a file shown as 0 Kb will in fact use<br/>anything from 4 Kb to 64 Kb depending on the sizes of the clusters on your<br/>hard disk.</p><p>I&apos;ve done that, and it now uses 10 posts per page as a default.</p><p>Anyway more later.
