Since there&apos;s vibrato and such for each of these<br/>notes, I&apos;ve grouped them into sections that delineate the difference<br/>between where one note ends and another begins. By exporting the data<br/>to MATLAB, I was able to obtain the mean MIDI note value for each<br/>note, which is what Tartini offers. By subtracting from the first<br/>note, and multiplying by 100, we can get the intervals present in this<br/>little sample in cents. Here&apos;s the initial output, confounded by some<br/>things I&apos;ll mention in just a second - | marks indicate the beginning<br/>and end of a phrase:</p><p>0  101.0662    6.9587  115.9874  | 140.2259  269.1987  161.2747<br/>255.3307  | 284.9845  365.8365  293.2587  380.1946</p><p>There are some strange values here - 255 and 365 cents are obviously<br/>just too low. And in this case, the reason is as you can see from the<br/>graph, Tartini sometimes will place one or two intermediate pitch<br/>values right between adjacent notes as if there were portamento on the<br/>signal, which in this case there isn&apos;t. So if I run this algorithm<br/>again, but I throw away the first and last pitch value for each note<br/>and then get the mean, I then obtain the following values are<br/>obtained:</p><p>0  107.4533    7.1250  118.7861 | 140.1010  271.5875  157.6017<br/>261.2908 | 286.6590  380.0879  282.9817  383.3003</p><p>By throwing the two values away at the end of each region as<br/>portamento artifacts, here&apos;s what we instead get:</p><p>0  105.9100    9.2350  119.4342 | 138.9017  270.9900  157.7350<br/>262.1585 | 285.4983  380.3490  274.8950  382.7712</p><p>Almost the same thing, except the 282 cents second to last note has<br/>now dropped to 274 cents. This is because this note was shorter in<br/>duration and likely too much data was thrown away; 282 cents was<br/>likely more accurate.</p><p>These are pretty much the exact values that I through out in my<br/>spectrogram results. Note that the during the second phrase, the minor<br/>third is a few cents off from 7/6, which is exactly as I heard it. The<br/>major third is played close to 5/4, which isn&apos;t what I heard but also<br/>answers another one of the proposed questions.</p><p>The first note of each phrase is the last note of the phrase before<br/>it. The first note is also generally a bit higher than the last one<br/>(the 119 cents moves up to 138 cents, the 262 cents moves up to 285<br/>cents).</p><p>In contrast, the negri generator is around 130 cents. In this case,<br/>I&apos;m not sure that it really does make sense to call this &quot;negri&quot;<br/>tempered, although that&apos;s the cognitive paradigm that my brain likes<br/>to snap this into (perhaps you could look at it like it&apos;s a negri<br/>well-temperament of some kind).
