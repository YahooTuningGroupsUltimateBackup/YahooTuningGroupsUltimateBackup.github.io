He describes just thirds, but doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; specify how the fifths be tempered, and uses 31-equal enharmonies that<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t work so well in 2/7-comma.  He says this is the usual way of<br/>&gt; tuning a keyboard.  So wouldn&apos;t Zarlino have known about it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this new translation of Zarlino we have<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/cap42-43.txt">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/cap42-43.txt</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the second part, starting &quot;Demonstration from which one can<br/>&gt; understand...&quot; considers some alternative temperament.  Can anybody make<br/>&gt; sense of it?  He says two intervals are mistuned by half a comma, which<br/>&gt; could be the two whole tones of 1/4-comma meantone.  But he also says<br/>&gt; the other intervals should be pure.  So is he mishearing a description<br/>&gt; of 1/4-comma meantone, or is this Vicentino&apos;s second tuning of the<br/>&gt; archicembalo which requires two manuals to make sense?  Or something else?</p><p>i was very intrigued by that passage too.  it seems to<br/>me that Zarlino is describing a tuning which preserves<br/>all the JI pitches of the diatonic scale except for<br/>the substitution of a &quot;meantone&quot; (it would be that of<br/>1/4-comma) in place of the two JI &quot;tones&quot; of 10:9 and 9:8.</p><p>he states clearly that the comma is equally divided in<br/>half, with half added to the one pitch and half taken<br/>away from the other, and that all other intervals remain<br/>the same as JI.</p><p>&gt; In 1563, Vicentino moved to Vicenza, which seems to be near Venice.</p><p>Vicenza is about 70 km (~45 miles) west of Venice.</p><p>&gt; That gave him plenty of time to convince Zarlino of the merits of<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone by 1571.</p><p>i like your speculations!  :)</p></div>
