Hope you and others find it useful.</p><p>&gt; [Joseph Pehrson, TD 533.25]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, 3^(-1) = -3<br/>&gt; 3^(0) = 0<br/>&gt; and 3^(1) = 3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, couldn&apos;t we just say -3, 0, 3 and be done with it??<br/>&gt; It&apos;s certainly a &quot;threethy&quot; kind of thing...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose that wouldn&apos;t give the picture of the 3-limit<br/>&gt; ratio, though (??)</p><p>Sure, -3,0,3 explains it perfectly for someone who likes to<br/>analyze in terms of odd-limits.  You&apos;re correct there.</p><p>But I (almost always) prefer the prime-limit orientation,<br/>in which case 3^(-1,0,1) works better because it leaves room<br/>for expansion into other prime dimensions.   For example...</p><p>The &apos;basic&apos; or &apos;primary&apos; mediant relationships are expressible<br/>as 5^(-1,0,1), which are equivalent in my theory to<br/>8/5 : 1/1 : 5/4.</p><p>The secondary mediant relationships are more complicated in<br/>this theory, because they are what cause the triangulation of<br/>the triangular lattice formula generally used here by others<br/>(and less often by me).  What I mean is: in the rectangular<br/>lattice formula (which resembles my formula more closely),<br/>these secondary mediant relationships do not appear as<br/>perfectly symmetrical to the primary mediant relationships,<br/>but rather are offset because they contain exponents of 3.<br/>(more on this below...)</p><p>These secondary mediant relationships (which I call &apos;secondary&apos;<br/>precisely because they include factors of 3 as well as 5,<br/>whereas the &apos;primary&apos; or &apos;basic&apos; ones only have 5 as a factor)<br/>are 5/3 : 1/1 : 6/5.  Because there are more than one factor,<br/>it&apos;s easier to notate the factors and exponents for these<br/>relationships in a matrix than on a single line:</p><p>         3^  5^<br/>6/5 == |  1  -1 |<br/>1/1 == |  0   0 |<br/>5/3 == | -1   1 |</p><p>(The &apos;==&apos; means &apos;equivalent to&apos; because it recognizes<br/>&apos;octave&apos;-equivalence: 3^1*5^-1 really equals 3/5, an<br/>&apos;octave&apos; below 6/5.)</p><p>The only reason 3^(-1,0,1) and 5^(-1,0,1) work so well as<br/>a convenient notation for those relationships is because<br/>they make use of only a single prime-factor.</p><p>So going back to what I just said about the lattice diagrams,<br/>we can represent the secondary mediant relationships on the<br/>rectangular lattice (with missing ratios as placeholders) as:</p><p>  3^-1*5^1<br/>     5/3 -----     -----<br/>      |         |          |<br/>      |         |          |<br/>               n^0<br/>         ----- 1/1 -----<br/>      |         |          |<br/>      |         |          |<br/>                        3^1*5^-1<br/>         -----     -----  6/5</p><p>On the triangular lattice the portrayal is direct:</p><p>    5/3<br/>      \<br/>       \<br/>       1/1<br/>         \<br/>          \<br/>          6/5</p><p>Perhaps the difference is clearer if I also include the<br/>Pythagorean and primary mediant relationships:</p><p>Rectangular formula:</p><p>    5/3 ---- 5/4 ----<br/>     |        |        |<br/>     |        |        |<br/>    4/3 ---- 1/1 ---- 3/2<br/>     |        |        |<br/>     |        |        |<br/>        ---- 8/5 ---- 6/5</p><p>Triangular formula:</p><p>        5/3   5/4<br/>        / \   / \<br/>       /   \ /   \<br/>     4/3 - 1/1 - 3/2<br/>       \   / \   /<br/>        \ /   \ /<br/>        8/5   6/5</p><p>It should be obvious that each approach offers its own<br/>advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Then, of course, to make things more complicated, *my* actual<br/>lattice formula is neither rectangular nor triangular, eschewing<br/>_a priori_ vector-angles and lengths, in favor of angles derived<br/>from a circular representation of the cents-value of the<br/>prime-factor itself, where 360 degrees represents the &apos;octave&apos;:</p><p>prime-angle [in DEGREES!] = MOD(((LOG(prime))*(360/LOG(2))),360)</p><p>(Actual calculations are made in radians rather than degrees.)</p><p>and vector-lengths calculated as units of the prime itself.</p><p>So, for example, in my lattice formula,</p><p>    prime   ~angle (degrees)<br/>      3        211<br/>      5        116<br/>      7        291<br/>     11        165<br/>     13        252</p><p>etc.; the 12-EDO semitone [= 2^(1/12)] is of course exactly<br/>30 degrees [= 360/12].</p><p>And the vector-lengths are simply 3 units for 3,<br/>5 units for 5, etc.</p><p>(It gets even more complicated: in order to portray the<br/>symmetry displayed by the negative and positive exponents,<br/>I have to use two different starting points as 0 degrees,<br/>180 degrees apart.  But I&apos;m not going to complicate things<br/>here with that...)</p><p>The great advantage of this approach (as I see it) is that,<br/>in theory, no matter how complex the JI description becomes,<br/>each ratio can be given an absolutely unique plot on the<br/>2-dimensional face on which the lattice must be drawn.</p><p>Of course, in practice there are bound to be lattice-points<br/>that overlap, because we can not see or print things on an<br/>infinitely-small-enough scale to keep everything separate.</p><p>But for my purposes (i.e., the very broad historical overview<br/>of JI theory presented in my book and on my webpages, and<br/>my use of these ideas in my own compositions), my formula<br/>works better for me than any others, except when the usually<br/>simpler requirements of Tuning List postings prompt me to<br/>use an easier-to-draw triangular or rectangular lattice.</p><p>Examples and a wordier explanation of my formula are at<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm</a></p><p>&gt; [Joe Pehrson]<br/>&gt;  Which I imagine, knowing Joe, goes off in three dimensions<br/>&gt; (! maybe 5!)</p><p>No, Joe, not at all - I think you may just be confused a<br/>little about this.</p><p>A string of &apos;4ths&apos; and &apos;5ths&apos;, which means the same as &apos;a<br/>Pythagorean system&apos; or &apos;3-limit system&apos;, is always going to<br/>be a linear system.  That is, if one uses a formula to construct<br/>a lattice diagram, where all exponents of 3 will be placed<br/>in their proper position in the series, it will always be a<br/>1-dimensional (i.e., linear) lattice.</p><p>So 3^(-1,0,1) is simply:</p><p>     4/3 --- 1/1 --- 3/2</p><p>using either the triangular or rectangular lattices.</p><p>Except for the angle, it looks the same using my formula too.<br/>If there is only one prime-factor in every ratio, it always<br/>makes a linear &apos;lattice&apos;.</p><p>&gt; [Joe Pehrson]<br/>&gt; In any case, I had *NO* idea that 3^(-1,0,1) could &quot;sum up&quot;<br/>&gt; the entire &quot;common practice&quot; period of Western music, both<br/>&gt; &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;popular.&quot;  Whew.  What a revelation!</p><p>Well, there are plenty of theorists who would argue that it<br/>can&apos;t.  But IMO, Riemann certainly looked deeply and found<br/>something that others before him had missed.</p><p>In fact, about 150 years before Riemann, Rameau said that<br/>the proportions 1:3:9 - yes, that&apos;s equivalent to 3^(-1,0,1)<br/>- were the basic ones in music, or something to that effect;<br/>AFAIK, that&apos;s the earliest statement of the idea.<br/>(scholarly commentary here would be appreciated)</p><p>Daniel Wolf has already pointed out that the biggest hole<br/>in Riemannian theory is its difficulty with codifying mediant<br/>relationships, which are a result of prime-factor 5.</p><p>In fact, the difficulty more-or-less lies in the existence<br/>of the Pythagorean and syntonic commas; the skhisma is pretty<br/>much small enough that discrepancies in performance associated<br/>with it aren&apos;t audible (that&apos;s *if* they exist at all), but<br/>those associated with commas are very noticeable to &apos;in-tune&apos;<br/>ears (c.f. the infamous &apos;comma-pump&apos; sequence).</p><p>Riemann himself considered his _Tonnetz_ lattice to represent<br/>JI, but present-day theorists exploring it further use 12-EDO,<br/>partly to eliminate the difficulties of dealing with the<br/>commas, and partly because 12-EDO is still the standard tuning<br/>for &apos;establishment&apos; theory and they are interested in discovering<br/>properties inherent in that tuning.</p><p>Without really having been conscious of Riemann&apos;s work as a<br/>basis when I formulated my own theories, I realize now that<br/>they can be seen as a sort of extension of his ideas into<br/>other prime-dimensions.</p><p>It&apos;s thus an easy step to go from Riemann&apos;s 3^(-1,0,1) to<br/>my &apos;each prime-factor is a unique dimension in the musical<br/>fabric&apos;.  In other words, n^(-1,0,1).</p><p>...with the _caveat_ that carrying the list of exponents<br/>out arbitrarily far will result in &apos;xenharmonic bridges&apos;<br/>(ratios within one prime-limit which are audibly<br/>indistinguishable from those in a higher limit).</p><p>I don&apos;t claim to be the first one to make that statement<br/>(&apos;each prime-factor...&apos; etc.; the n^(-1,0,1) paradigm)<br/>- anyone out there know the history on that one? - but it<br/>certainly has become the basis of all my work at this point.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
