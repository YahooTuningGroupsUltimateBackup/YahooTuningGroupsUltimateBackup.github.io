Tessitura means the<br/>vocal range where most of the pitches in a vocal part fall. A piece<br/>can be within the range of a particular singer, but if the tessitura<br/>lies in the upper limit of his/her range, then the part could still<br/>represent a strain for the singer. This term certainly has nothing to<br/>do with any kind of timbre, vocal or otherwise.</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve just listened to this.
